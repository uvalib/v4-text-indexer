      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. TO ROBERT EARL OF HOLDERNESSE, BARON D'ARCY, MENIL AND CONYERS, LORD WARDEN OF HIS MAJESTY'S CINQUE PORTS, AND GOVERNOR OF DOVER CASTLE. SONNET. D'arcy, to thee, whate'er of happier vein, Smit with the love of Song, my youth essay'd, This verse devotes from Aston's secret shade, Where letter'd Ease, thy gift, endears the scene. Here, as the light-wing'd moments glide serene, I weave the bower, around the tufted mead In careless flow the simple pathway lead, And strew with many a rose the shaven green. So, to deceive my solitary days, With rural toils ingenuous arts I blend, Secure from envy, negligent of praise, Yet not unknown to fame, if D'Arcy lend His wonted smile to dignify my lays, The Muse's Patron, but the Poet's Friend. W. MASON. May 12, 1763. MUSÆUS: Mr. Pope died in the year 1744; this Poem was then written, and published first in the year 1747. A MONODY TO THE MEMORY OF MR. POPE. IN IMITATION OF MILTON'S LYCIDAS. ???? ??? ???? ?????????? ???????? ??? ????????? ?????, ??? ???. ???? ?? ??? ?????? ????????????????, ??? ??? ????? ???????? ??????, ??????? ?? ???? ?? ???????????????, ??? ??? ?? ?????? ???????. Dionys. Halicarn. in Dinarcho. Sorrowing I catch the reed, and call the Muse; If yet a Muse on Britain's plain abide, Since rapt Musæus tun'd his parting strain: With him they liv'd, with him, perchance, they dy'd. For who e'er since their virgin charms espy'd, Or on the banks of Thames, or met their train, Where Isis sparkles to the sunny ray? Or have they deign'd to play, Where Camus winds along his broider'd vale, Feeding each blue-bell pale, and daisie pied, That fling their fragrance round his rushy side? Yet ah! ye are not dead, Celestial Maids; Immortal as ye are, ye may not die: Nor is it meet ye fly these pensive glades, Ere round his laureat herse ye heave the sigh. Stay then awhile, oh stay, ye fleeting fair; Revisit yet, nor hallow'd Hippocrene, Nor Thespiæ's grove; till with harmonious teen Ye sooth his shade, and slowly-dittied air. Such tribute pour'd, again ye may repair To what lov'd haunt ye whilom did elect; Whether Lycæus, or that mountain fair, Trim Mænalus, with piny verdure deckt. But now it boots ye not in these to stray, Or yet Cyllene's hoary shade to chuse, Or where mild Ladon's welling waters play. Forego each vain excuse, And haste to Thames's shores; for Thames shall join Our sad society, and passing mourn, The tears fast-trickling o'er his silver urn. And, when the Poet's widow'd grot he laves, His reed-crown'd locks shall shake, his head shall bow, His tide no more in eddies blithe shall rove, But creep soft by with long-drawn murmurs slow. For oft the mighty Master rous'd his waves With martial notes, or lull'd with strain of love: He must not now in brisk meanders flow Gamesome, and kiss the sadly-silent shore, Without the loan of some poetic woe. Say first, Sicilian Muse, For, with thy sisters, thou didst weeping stand In silent circle at the solemn scene, When Death approach'd, and wav'd his ebon wand, Say how each laurel droopt its with'ring green? How, in yon grot, each silver-trickling spring Wander'd the shelly channels all among; While as the coral roof did softly ring Responsive to their sweetly-doleful song. Meanwhile all pale th' expiring Poet laid, And sunk his awful head, While vocal shadows pleasing dreams prolong; For so, his sick'ning spirits to release, They pour'd the balm of visionary peace. First, sent from Cam's fair banks, like Palmer old, Came Tityrus i. e. Chaucer, a name frequently given him by Spenser. See Shep. Cal. Ec. 2, 6, 12, and elsewhere. slow, with head all silver'd o'er, And in his hand an oaken crook he bore, And thus in antique guise short talk did hold: “Grete clerk of Fame' is house, whose excellence “Maie wele befitt thilk place of eminence, “Mickle of wele betide thy houres last, “For mich gode wirkè to me don and past. “For syn the days whereas my lyre ben strongen, “And deftly many a mery laie I songen, “Old Time, which alle things don maliciously “Gnawen with rusty tooth continually, “Gnattrid my lines, that they all cancrid ben, “Till at the last thou smoothen 'hem hast again; “Sithence full semely gliden my rimes rude, “As, (if fitteth thilk similitude) “Whannè shallow brook yrenneth hobling on, “Ovir rough stones it makith full rough song; “But, them stones removen, this lite rivere “Stealith forth by, making plesaunt murmere: “So my sely rymes, whoso may them note, “Thou makist everichone to ren right sote; “And in thy verse entunist so fetisely, “That men sayen I make trewe melody, “And speaken every dele to myne honoure. “Mich wele, grete clerk, betide thy parting houre!” He ceas'd his homely rhyme. When Colin Clout, i. e. Spenser, which name he gives himself throughout his works. Eliza's shepherd swain, The blithest lad that ever pip'd on plain, Came with his reed soft warbling on the way, And thrice he bow'd his head with motion mild, And thus his gliding numbers gan essay. I. “ The two first stanzas of this speech, as they relate to Pastoral, are written in the measure which Spenser uses in the first eclogue of the Shepherd's Calendar: the rest, where he speaks of fable, are in the stanza of the Faery Queen.Ah! luckless swain, alas! how art thou lorn, “Who once like me could'st frame thy pipe to play “Shepherds devise, and chear the ling'ring morn: “Ne bush, ne breere, but learnt thy roundelay, “Ah plight too sore such worth to equal right! “Ah worth too high to meet such piteous plight! II. “But I nought strive, poor Colin, to compare “My Hobbin's or my Thenot's rustic skill “To thy deft swains, whose dapper ditties rare “Surpass ought else of quaintest shepherd's quill. “Ev'n Roman Tityrus, that peerless wight, “Mote yield to thee for dainties of delight. III. “Eke when in Fable's flow'ry paths you stray'd, “Masking in cunning feints truth's splendent face; “Ne Sylph, ne Sylphid, but due tendance paid, “To shield Belinda's lock from felon base, “But all mote nought avail such harm to chace. “Then Una fair 'gan droop her princely mien, “Eke Florimel, and all my faery race: “Belinda far surpast my beauties sheen, “Belinda, subject meet for such soft lay, I ween. IV. “Like as in village troop of birdlings trim, “Where Chanticleer his red crest high doth hold, “And quacking ducks, that wont in lake to swim, “And turkeys proud, and pigeons nothing bold; “If chance the peacock doth his plumes unfold, “Eftsoons their meaner beauties all decaying, “He glist'neth purple and he glist'neth gold, “Now with bright green, now blue himself arraying. “Such is thy beauty bright, all other beauties swaying. V. “But why do I descant this toyish rhyme, “And fancies light in simple guise pourtray, “Listing to chear thee at this rueful time, “While as black Death doth on thy heartstrings prey? “Yet rede aright, and if this friendly lay “Thou nathless judgest all too slight and vain, “Let my well-meaning mend my ill essay: “So may I greet thee with a nobler strain, “When soon we meet for aye, in yon star-sprinkled plain.” Last came a bard of more majestic tread, And Thyrsis i. e. Milton. Lycidas and the Epitaphium Damonis are the only Pastorals we have of Milton's; in the latter of which, where he laments Car. Deodatus under the name of Damon, he calls himself Thyrsis. hight by Dryad, Fawn, or Swain, Whene'er he mingled with the shepherd train; But seldom that; for higher thoughts he fed; For him full oft the heav'nly Muses led To clear Euphrates, and the secret mount, To Araby, and Eden, fragrant climes, All which the sacred bard would oft recount: And thus in strain, unus'd in sylvan shade, To sad Musæus rightful homage paid. “Thrice hail, thou heav'n-taught warbler! last and best “Of all the train! Poet, in whom conjoin'd “All that to ear, or heart, or head, could yield “Rapture; harmonious, manly, clear, sublime. “Accept this gratulation: may it chear “Thy sinking soul; nor these corporeal ills “Aught daunt thee, or appal. Know, in high heav'n “Fame blooms eternal o'er that spirit divine, “Who builds immortal verse. There thy bold Muse, “Which while on earth could breathe Mæonian fire, “Shall soar seraphic heights; while to her voice “Ten thousand hierarchies of angels harp “Symphonious, and with dulcet harmonies “Usher the song rejoicing. I, meanwhile, “To sooth thee in these irksome hours of pain, “Approach, thy visitant, with mortal praise “To praise thee mortal. First, for Rhyme subdued; “Rhyme, erst the minstrel of primæval Night, “And Chaos, Anarch old: She near their throne “Oft taught the rattling elements to chime “With tenfold din; till late to earth upborn “On strident plume, what time fair Poesie “Emerg'd from Gothic cloud, and faintly shot “Rekindling gleams of lustre. Her the fiend “Opprest; forcing to utter uncouth dirge, “Runic, or Leonine; and with dire chains “Fetter'd her scarce-fledg'd pinion. I such bonds “Aim'd to destroy, hopeless that Art could ease “Their thraldom, and to liberal use convert. “This wonder to atchieve Musæus came; “Thou cam'st, and at thy magic touch the chains “Off dropt, and (passing strange!) soft-wreathed bands “Of flow'rs their place supply'd: which well the Muse “Might wear for choice, not force; obstruction none, “But loveliest ornament. Wond'rous this, yet here “The wonder rests not; various argument “Remains for me, uncertain, where to cull “The leading grace, where countless graces charm. “Various this peaceful cave; this mineral roof; “This 'semblage meet of coral, ore, and shell; “These pointed crystals through the shadowy clefts “Bright glist'ring; all these slowly-dripping rills, “That tinkling wander o'er the pebbled floor: “Yet not this various peaceful cave, with this “Its mineral roof; nor this assemblage meet “Of coral, ore, and shell; nor mid the shade “These pointed crystals, glist'ring fair; nor rills, “That wander tinkling o'er the pebbled floor, “Deal charms more various to each raptured sense, “Than thy mellifluous lay ?” “Cease, friendly swain; “(Musæus cried, and raised his aching head) “All praise is foreign, but of true desert; “Plays round the head, but comes not to the heart. “Ah! why recall the toys of thoughtless youth? “When flowery fiction held the place of truth? “Ere sound to sense resign'd the silken rein, “And the light lay ran musically vain. “Oh! in that lay had richest fancy flow'd, “The Syrens warbled, and the Graces glow'd; “Had liveliest nature, happiest art combin'd; “That lent each charm, and this each charm refined, “Alas! how little were my proudest boast! “The sweetest trifler of my tribe at most. “To sway the judgment, while he soothes the ear; “To curb mad passion in its wild career; “To wake by sober touch the useful lyre, “And rule, with reason's rigour, fancy's fire: “Be this the poet's praise. And this possest, “Take, Dulness and thy dunces! take the rest. “Come then that honest fame; whose temp'rate ray “Or gilds the satire, or the moral lay; “Which dawns, though thou, rough Donne! hew out the line: “But beams, sage Horace! from each strain of thine. “Oh, if like these, with conscious freedom bold, “One Poet more his manly measures roll'd, “Like these led forth the indignant Muse to brave “The venal statesman, and the titled slave; “To strip from frontless Vice her stars and strings, “Nor spare her basking in the smile of kings: “If grave, yet lively; rational, yet warm; “Clear to convince, and eloquent to charm; “He pour'd, for Virtue's cause, serene along “The purest precept, in the sweetest song: “If, for her cause, his heav'n-directed plan “Mark'd each meander in the maze of man; “Unmoved by sophistry, unawed by name, “No dupe to doctrines, and no fool to fame; “Led by no system's devious glare astray, “That meteor-like, but glitters to betray. “Yes, if his soul to reason's rule resign'd, “And heaven's own views fair-opening on his mind, “Caught from bright nature's flame the living ray, “Through passion's cloud pour'd in resistless day; “And taught mankind in reas'ning Pride's despite, “That God is wise, and all that is right: “If this his boast, pour here the welcome lays; “Praise less than this is mockery of praise.” “To pour that praise be mine,” fair Virtue cry'd; And shot, all radiant, through an opening cloud. But ah! my Muse, how will thy voice express The immortal strain, harmonious, as it flow'd? Ill suits immortal strain a Doric dress: And far too high already hast thou soar'd. Enough for thee, that, when the lay was o'er, The goddess clasp'd him to her throbbing breast. But what might that avail? Blind Fate before Had op'd her shears, to cut his vital thread! And who may dare gainsay her stern behest? Now thrice he waved the hand, thrice bow'd the head, And sigh'd his soul to rest. Now wept the Nymphs; witness, ye waving shades! Witness, ye winding streams! the Nymphs did weep: The heavenly Goddess too with tears did steep Her plaintive voice, that echo'd through the glades; And, “cruel gods,” and “cruel stars,” she cried: Nor did the shepherds, through the woodlands wide, On that sad day, or to the pensive brook, Or silent river, drive their thirsty flocks: Nor did the wild-goat brouze the shrubby rocks: And Philomel her custom'd oak forsook: And roses wan were waved by zephyrs weak, As Nature's self was sick: And every lily droop'd its silver head. Sad sympathy! yet sure his rightful meed, Who charm'd all nature: well might Nature mourn Through all her choicest sweets Musæus dead. Here end we, Goddess! this your shepherd sang, All as his hands an ivy chaplet wove. Oh! make it worthy of the sacred Bard; And make it equal to the shepherd's love. Thou too accept the strain with meet regard: For sure, blest Shade, thou hear'st my doleful song; Whether with angel troops, the stars among, From golden harp thou call'st seraphic lays; Or, for fair Virtue's cause, now doubly dear, Thou still art hov'ring o'er our tuneless sphere; And mov'st some hidden spring her weal to raise. Thus the fond swain his Doric oate essay'd, Manhood's prime honours rising on his cheek: Trembling he strove to court the tuneful Maid With strippling arts, and dalliance all too weak, Unseen, unheard, beneath an hawthorn shade. But now dun clouds the welkin 'gan to streak; And now down-dropt the larks, and ceased their strain: They ceased, and with them ceased the shepherd swain. ODES. ODE I. TO MEMORY. I Mother of wisdom! According to a fragment of Afranius, who makes Experience and Memory the parents of Wisdom. Usus me genuit, Mater peperit Memoria ?????? vocant me Graii, vos Sapientiam. This passage is preserved by Aulus Gellius, lib. xiii. cap. 8. thou, whose sway The throng'd ideal hosts obey; Who bid'st their ranks, now vanish, now appear, Flame in the van, or darken in the rear; Accept this votive verse. Thy reign Nor place can fix, nor power restrain. All, all is thine. For thee, the ear and eye Rove through the realms of grace and harmony: The senses thee spontaneous serve, That wake, and thrill through every nerve. Else vainly soft, loved Philomel! would flow The soothing sadness of thy warbled woe: Else vainly sweet yon woodbine shade With clouds of fragrance fill the glade; Vainly the cygnet spread her downy plume, The vine gush nectar, and the virgin bloom. But swift to thee, alive, and warm, Devolves each tributary charm: See modest Nature bring her simple stores, Luxuriant Art exhaust her plastic powers; While every flower in Fancy's clime, Each gem of old heroic Time, Cull'd by the hand of the industrious Muse, Around thy shrine their blended beams diffuse. II Hail, Memory! hail. Behold, I lead To that high shrine the sacred Maid: Thy daughter she, the empress of the lyre, The first, the fairest of Aonia's quire. She comes, and lo, thy realms expand: She takes her delegated stand Full in the midst, and o'er thy numerous train Displays the awful wonders of her reign. There throned supreme in native state If Sirius flame with fainting heat, She calls; ideal groves their shade extend, The cool gale breathes, the silent showers descend. Or, if bleak winter, frowning round, Disrobe the trees, and chill the ground, She, mild magician, waves her potent wand, And ready summers wake at her command. See, visionary suns arise, Through silver clouds, and azure skies; See sportive zephyrs fan the crisped streams; Thro' shadowy brakes light glance the sparkling beams: While, near the secret moss-grown cave, That stands beside the crystal wave, Sweet Echo, rising from her rocky bed, Mimics the feather'd chorus o'er her head. III Rise, hallow'd Milton! rise, and say, How, at thy gloomy close of day; How, when “depress'd by age, beset with wrongs:” When “fall'n on evil days and evil tongues;” When darkness, brooding on thy sight, Exiled the sov'reign lamp of light; Say, what could then one cheering hope diffuse? What friends were thine, save Mem'ry and the Muse? Hence the rich spoils, thy studious youth Caught from the stores of ancient truth: Hence all thy classic wand'rings could explore, When rapture led thee to the Latian shore; Each scene, that Tiber's bank supplied; Each grace, that play'd on Arno's side; The tepid gales, through Tuscan glades that fly; The blue serene, that spreads Hesperia's sky; Were still thy own: thy ample mind Each charm received, retain'd, combined. And thence “the nightly visitant,” that came To touch thy bosom with her sacred flame, Recall'd the long-lost beams of grace, That whilom shot from Nature's face, When God, in Eden, o'er her youthful breast Spread with his own right hand perfection's gorgeous vest. ODE II. TO A WATER-NYMPH. This Ode was written in the year 1747, and published in the first volume of Mr. Dodsley's Miscellany. It is here revised throughout, and concluded according to the Author's original idea. Ye green hair'd Nymphs, whom Pan's decrees Have given to guard this solemn wood, A seat near ? finely situated, with a great command of water; but disposed in a very false taste. To speed the shooting scions into trees, And call the roseate blossom from the bud, Attend. But chief, thou Naiad, wont to lead This fluid crystal sparkling as it flows, Whither, ah, whither art thou fled? What shade is conscious to thy woes? Ah, 'tis yon poplars' awful gloom: Poetic eyes can pierce the scene; Can see thy drooping head, thy withering bloom; See grief diffused o'er all thy languid mien. Well may'st thou wear misfortune's fainting air Well rend those flow'ry honours from thy brow; Devolve that length of careless hair; And give thine azure veil to flow Loose to the wind: for, oh, thy pain The pitying Muse can well relate: That pitying Muse shall breathe her tend'rest strain, To teach the echoes thy disastrous fate. 'Twas, where yon beeches' crowding branches closed, What time the dog-star's flames intensely burn, In gentle indolence composed, Reclined upon thy trickling urn, Slumb'ring thou lay'st, all free from fears; No friendly dream foretold thine harm; When sudden, see, the tyrant Art appears, To snatch the liquid treasures from thine arm. Art, Gothic Art, has seized thy darling vase: That vase which silver-slipper'd Thetis gave, For some soft story told with grace, Among the associates of the wave; When, in sequester'd coral vales, While worlds of waters roll'd above, The circling sea-nymphs told alternate tales Of fabled changes, and of slighted love. Ah! loss too justly mourn'd: for now the fiend Has on yon shell-wrought terrace pois'd it high; And thence he bids its streams descend, With torturing regularity. From step to step, with sullen sound, The forc'd cascades indignant leap; Now sinking fill the bason's measur'd round; There in a dull stagnation doom'd to sleep. Where now the vocal pebbles' gurgling song? The rill slow-dripping from its rocky spring? What free meander winds along, Or curls when Zephyr waves his wing? Alas, these glories are no more: Fortune, oh, give me to redeem The ravish'd vase; oh, give me to restore Its ancient honours to this hapless stream. Then, Nymph, again, with all their wonted ease, Thy wanton waters, volatile and free, Shall wildly warble, as they please, Their soft, loquacious harmony. Where Thou and Nature bid them rove, There will I gently aid their way; Whether to darken in the shadowy grove, Or, in the mead, reflect the dancing ray. For thee too, Goddess, o'er that hallow'd spot, Where first thy fount of chrystal bubbles bright, These hands shall arch a rustic grot, Impervious to the garish light. I'll not demand of Ocean's pride To bring his coral spoils from far: Nor will I delve yon yawning mountain's side, For latent minerals rough, or polish'd spar: But antique roots, with ivy dark o'ergrown, Steep'd in the bosom of thy chilly lake, Thy touch shall turn to living stone; And these the simple roof shall deck. Yet grant one melancholy boon: Grant that, at evening's sober hour, Led by the lustre of the rising moon, My step may frequent tread thy pebbled floor. There, if perchance I wake the love lorn theme, In melting accents querulously slow, Kind Naiad, let thy pitying stream With wailing notes accordant flow: So shalt thou sooth this heaving heart, That mourns a faithful virgin lost; So shall thy murmurs, and my sighs impart Some share of pensive pleasure to her ghost. ODE III. ON LEAVING ST. JOHN'S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, 1746. Granta farewell! thy time-ennobled shade No more must glimmer o'er my musing head, Where waking dreams, of Fancy born, Around me floated eve and morn. I go—Yet, mindful of the charms I leave, Mem'ry shall oft their pleasing portrait give; Shall teach th' ideal stream to flow Like gentle Camus, soft and slow; Recall each antique spire, each cloister's gloom, And bid this vernal noon of life re-bloom. Ev'n if old age, in northern clime, Shower on my head the snows of time, There still shall Gratitude her tribute pay To him who first approv'd my infant lay; It was by the advice of Dr. Powell, the author's tutor at St. John's College, that Musæus was published. This Ode was for the first time printed from a corrected copy 1797. And fair to Recollection's eyes Shall Powell's various virtues rise. See the bright train around their fav'rite throng: See Judgment lead meek Diffidence along, Impartial Reason following slow, Disdain at Error's shrine to bow, And Science, free from hypothetic pride, Proceed where sage Experience deigns to guide. Such were the guests from Jove that came, Genius of Greece! to fix thy fame: These wak'd the bold Socratic thought, and drest Its simple beauties in the splendid vest Of Plato's diction: These were seen Full oft on academic green; Full oft where clear Ilissus warbling stream'd; Bright o'er each master of the mind they beam'd, Inspiring that preceptive art Which, while it charm'd, refin'd the heart, And with spontaneous ease, not pedant toil, Bade Fancy's roses bloom in Reason's soil. The fane of Science then was hung With wreathes that on Parnassus sprung; And in that fane to his encircling youth The Sage dispens'd th' ambrosial food of Truth, Alluding to the ????????, particularly Zenophon's respecting the moral songs of the Greeks. —See Dr. Hurd's note on the 219th verse of Horace's Art of Poetry, Vol. i. p. 173, 4th edit. And mingled in the social bowl Friendship, the nectar of the soul. Meanwhile accordant to the Dorian lyre, The moral Muses join'd the vocal choir, And Freedom dancing to the sound Mov'd in chaste Order's graceful round. Thus, Athens, were thy freeborn offspring train'd To act each patriot part thy laws ordain'd; Thus void of magisterial awe, Each youth in his instructor saw Those manners mild, unknown in modern school, Which form'd him by example more than rule; And felt that, varying but in name, The Friend and Master were the same. ODE IV. ON EXPECTING TO RETURN TO CAMBRIDGE, 1747. This was also for the first time printed 1797. In the interval between the dates of the preceding Ode and of this, the author had been unexpectedly nominated by the Fellows of Pembroke Hall to a vacant Fellowship. See Memoirs of Mr. Gray, vol. iii, p. 70, edit. 1778. I. 1. While Commerce, riding on thy refluent tide, Impetuous Humber! wafts her stores From Belgian or Norwegian shores And spreads her countless sails from side to side; While, from yon crowded strand, Thy genuine sons the pinnace light unmoor, Break the white surge with many a sparkling oar, To pilot the rich freight o'er each insidious sand; I. 2. At distance here my alien footsteps stray, O'er this bleak plain unblest with shade, Imploring Fancy's willing aid To bear me from thy banks of sordid clay: Her barque the fairy lends, With rainbow pennants deck'd, and cordage fine As the wan silkworm spins her golden twine, And, ere I seize the helm, the magic voyage ends. I. 3. Lo, where peaceful Camus glides Through his ozier-fringed vale, Sacred Leisure there resides Musing in his cloyster pale. Wrapt in a deep solemnity of shade, Again I view fair Learning's spiry seats, Again her ancient elms o'erhang my head, Again her votary Contemplation meets, Again I listen to Æolian lays, Or on those bright heroic portraits gaze, That, to my raptur'd eye, the classic page displays. II. 1. Here, though from childhood to the Muses known, The Lyric Queen her charms reveal'd; Here, by superior influence held My soul enchain'd, and made me all her own. Re-echo every plain! While, from the chords she tun'd, the silver voice Of heav'n-born harmony proclaims the choice My youthful heart has made to all Aonia's train. II. 2. Here too each social charm that most endears: Sincerity with open eye, And frolic Wit, and Humour sly, Sat sweetly mix'd among my young compeers. When, o'er the sober bowl, That but dispell'd the mind's severer gloom, And gave the budding thought its perfect bloom, Truth took its circling course and flow'd from soul to soul. II. 3. Hail ye friendly faithful few! All the streams that Science pours, Ever pleasing, ever new, From her ample urn be yours. When, when shall I amid your train appear, O when be number'd with your constant guests, When join your converse, when applauding hear The mental music of accordant breasts? Till then, fair Fancy! wake these favourite themes, Still kindly shed these visionary gleams, Till suns autumnal rise, and realize my dreams. ODE V. FOR MUSIC. This Ode was written at the request of the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, set to music by the late Dr. Boyce, and performed in the Senate-House at Cambridge, July 1st, 1749, at the Installation of his Grace Thomas Hollis, Duke of Newcastle, Chancellor of the University; it has since appeared in some Miscellaneous Collections of Poetry, and was therefore inserted 1797. IRREGULAR. I. Here all thy active fires diffuse, Thou genuine British Muse; Hither descend from yonder orient sky, Cloath'd in thy heav'n-wove robe of harmony. Come, imperial Queen of Song; Come with all that free-born grace Which lifts thee from the servile throng, Who meanly mimic thy majestic pace; That glance of dignity divine, Which speaks thee of celestial line; Proclaims thee inmate of the sky, Daughter of Jove and Liberty. II. The elevated soul, that feels Thy awful impulse, walks the fragrant ways Of honest unpolluted praise: He with impartial justice deals The blooming chaplets of immortal lays: He flies above ambition's low career; And thron'd in Truth's meridian sphere, Thence, with a bold and heav'n-directed aim, Full on fair Virtue's shrine he pours the rays of Fame. III. Goddess! thy piercing eye explores The radiant range of Beauty's stores, The steep ascent of pine-clad hills, The silver slope of falling rills; Catches each lively-coloured grace, The crimson of the Wood-Nymph's face, The verdure of the velvet lawn, The purple of the eastern dawn, And all the tints that, rang'd in vivid glow, Mark the bold sweep of the celestial bow. IV. But loftier far her tuneful transports rise, When all the moral beauties meet her eyes: The sacred zeal for Freedom's cause, That fires the glowing Patriot's breast; The honest pride that plumes the Hero's crest, When for his country's aid the steel he draws: Or that, the calm yet active heat, With which mild Genius warms the Sage's heart, To lift fair Science to a loftier seat, Or stretch to ampler bounds the wide domain of art. These, the best blossoms of the virtuous mind, She culls with taste refin'd; From their ambrosial bloom With bee-like skill she draws the rich perfume, And blends the sweets they all convey In the soft balm of her mellifluous lay. V. Is there a clime, in one collected beam Where charms like these their varied radiance stream? Is there a plain, whose genial soil inhales Glory's invigorating gales, Her brightest beams where Emulation spreads, Her kindliest dews where Science sheds, Where ev'ry stream of Genius flows, Where ev'ry flow'r of Virtue glows? Thither the Muse exulting flies, There loudly cries? Majestic GRANTA! hail thy awful name, Dear to the Muse, to Liberty, to Fame. VI. You too, illustrious Train, she greets, Who first in these inspiring seats Caught that ætherial fire That prompts you to aspire To deeds of civic note: whether to shield From base chicane your country's laws; To pale Disease the bloom of health to yield; Or in Religion's hallow'd cause Those heavenly-temper'd arms to wield, That drive the foes of Faith indignant from the field. VII. And now she tunes her plausive song To you her sage domestic throng; Who here at Learning's richest shrine, Dispense to each ingenuous youth The treasures of immortal Truth, And open Wisdom's golden mine. Each youth, inspir'd by your persuasive art, Clasps the dear form of Virtue to his heart; And feels in his transported soul Enthusiastic raptures roll, Gen'rous as those the Sons of Cecrops caught In hoar Lycæum's shades from Plato's fire-clad thought. VIII. O GRANTA! on thy happy plain Still may these Attic glories reign: Still may'st thou keep thy wonted state In unaffected grandeur great; Great as at this illustrious hour, When He, whom George's well-weigh'd choice, And Albion's gen'ral voice Have lifted to the fairest heights of pow'r, When He appears, and deigns to shine The leader of thy learned line; And bids the verdure of thy olive bough Mid all his civic chaplets twine, And add fresh glories to his honour'd brow. IX. Haste then, and amply o'er his head The graceful foliage spread. Meanwhile the Muse shall snatch the trump of Fame, And lift her swelling accents high, To tell the world that PELHAM's name Is dear to Learning as to Liberty. ODE VI. TO INDEPENDENCY. I Here, on my native shore reclin'd, While Silence rules this midnight hour, I woo thee, Goddess. On my musing mind Descend, propitious Power! And bid these ruffling gales of grief subside: Bid my calm'd soul with all thy influence shine; As yon chaste orb along this ample tide Draws the long lustre of her silver line, While the hush'd breeze its last weak whisper blows, And lulls old Humber to his deep repose. II Come to thy vot'ry's ardent prayer, In all thy graceful plainness drest: No knot confines thy waving hair, No zone, thy floating vest; Unsullied Honour decks thine open brow, And Candour brightens in thy modest eye: Thy blush is warm Content's ethereal glow; Thy smile is Peace; thy step is Liberty: Thou scatter'st blessings round with lavish hand, As Spring with careless fragrance fills the land. III As now o'er this lone beach I stray, Thy fav'rite swain Andrew Marvell, born at Kingston upon Hull in the year 1620. oft stole along, And artless wove his Dorian lay, Far from the busy throng. Thou heard'st him, Goddess, strike the tender string, And bad'st his soul with bolder passions move: Soon these responsive shores forgot to ring, With Beauty's praise, or plaint of slighted Love; To loftier flights his daring genius rose, And led the war, 'gainst thine, and Freedom's foes. IV Pointed with Satire's keenest steel, The shafts of Wit he darts around; Ev'n mitred Dulness See The Rehearsal transprosed, and an account of the effect of that satire, in the Biographia Britannica, art. Marvell. learns to feel, And shrinks beneath the wound. In awful poverty his honest Muse Walks forth vindictive thro' a venal land: In vain Corruption sheds her golden dews, In vain Oppression lifts her iron hand; He scorns them both, and, arm'd with Truth alone, Bids Lust and Folly tremble on the throne. V Behold, like him, immortal Maid, The Muses' vestal fires I bring: Here, at thy feet, the sparks I spread: Propitious wave thy wing, And fan them to that dazzling blaze of song, Which glares tremendous on the sons of Pride. But, hark! methinks I hear her hallow'd tongue! In distant trills it echoes o'er the tide; Now meets mine ear with warbles wildly free, As swells the lark's meridian extasy. VI “Fond youth! to Marvell's patriot fame. “Thy humble breast must ne'er aspire. “Yet nourish still the lambent flame; “Still strike thy blameless lyre: “Led by the moral Muse, securely rove; “And all the vernal sweets thy vacant youth “Can cull from busy Fancy's fairy grove, “Oh hang their foliage round the fane of Truth: “To arts like these devote thy tuneful toil, “And meet its fair reward in D'Arcy's smile. VII “'Tis he, my Son, alone shall chear “Thy sick'ning soul; at that sad hour, “When o'er a much-lov'd parent's bier, “Thy duteous sorrows shower: “At that sad hour, when all thy hopes decline; “When pining Care leads on her pallid train, “And sees thee, like the weak, and widow'd vine, “Winding thy blasted tendrils o'er the plain: “At that sad hour shall D'Arcy lend his aid, “And raise with Friendship's arm thy drooping head. VIII “This fragrant wreath, the Muse's meed, “That bloom'd those vocal shades among, “Where never Flatt'ry dar'd to tread, “Or Interest's servile throng; “Receive, thou favour'd Son, at my command, “And keep, with sacred care, for D'Arcy's brow: “Tell him, 'twas wove by my immortal hand, “I breath'd on every flower a purer glow; “Say, for thy sake I send the gift divine “To him, who calls thee his, yet makes thee mine.” ODE VII. TO A FRIEND. I Ah! cease this kind persuasive strain, Which, when it flows from Friendship's tongue, However weak, however vain, O'erpowers beyond the Siren's song: Leave me, my friend, indulgent go, And let me muse upon my woe. Why lure me from these pale retreats? Why rob me of these pensive sweets? Can Music's voice, can Beauty's eye, Can Painting's glowing hand supply A charm so suited to my mind, As blows this hollow gust of wind, As drops this little weeping rill Soft tinkling down the moss-grown hill, While thro' the west, where sinks the crimson day, Meek Twilight slowly sails, and waves her banners gray? II Say, from Affliction's various source Do none but turbid waters flow? And cannot Fancy clear their course? For Fancy is the friend of Woe. Say, mid that grove, in love-lorn state, While yon poor ringdove mourns her mate, Is all, that meets the shepherd's ear, Inspir'd by anguish, and despair? Ah! no; fair Fancy rules the song: She swells her throat; she guides her tongue; She bids the waving aspin spray Quiver in cadence to her lay; She bids the fringed osiers bow, And rustle round the lake below, To suit the tenor of her gurgling sighs, And sooth her throbbing breast with solemn sympathies. III To thee, whose young and polish'd brow The wrinkling hand of Sorrow spares; Whose cheeks, bestrew'd with roses, know No channel for the tide of tears; To thee yon abbey dank, and lone, Where ivy chains each mould'ring stone That nods o'er many a martyr's tomb, May cast a formidable gloom. Yet some there are, who, free from fear, Could wander through the cloisters drear, Could rove each desolated isle, Though midnight thunders shook the pile; And dauntless view, or seem to view, (As faintly flash the lightnings blue) Thin shiv'ring ghosts from yawning charnels throng, And glance with silent sweep the shaggy vaults along. IV But such terrific charms as these, I ask not yet: My sober mind The fainter forms of sadness please; My sorrows are of softer kind. Through this still valley let me stray, Rapt in some strain of pensive Gray: Whose lofty genius bears along The conscious dignity of Song; And, scorning from the sacred store To waste a note on Pride or Power, Roves through the glimmering twilight gloom, And warbles round each rustic tomb: He, too, perchance (for well I know, His heart can melt with friendly woe) He, too, perchance, when these poor limbs are laid, Will heave one tuneful sigh, and sooth my hov'ring shade. ODE VIII. ON THE FATE OF TYRANNY. This Ode is a free paraphrase of part of the 14th chapter of Isaiah, where the Prophet, after he has foretold the destruction of Babylon, subjoins a Song of Triumph, which, he supposes, the Jews will sing when his prediction is fulfilled. And it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve, that thou shall take up this proverb against the King of Babylon, and say, “How hath the oppressor ceased,” &amp;c. 1st Strophe, ver. 4, 5, 6. I. 1. Oppression dies: the tyrant falls: The golden city bows her walls! Jehovah breaks the avenger's rod. The Son of Wrath, whose ruthless hand Hurl'd desolation o'er the land, Has run his raging race, has closed the scene of blood. Chiefs arm'd around behold their vanquish'd lord; Nor spread the guardian shield, nor lift the loyal sword. I. 2. 1st Antistrophe, The whole earth is at rest, &amp;c. ver. 7, 8.He falls; and earth again is free. Hark! at the call of Liberty, All Nature lifts the choral song. The fir-trees, on the mountain's head, Rejoice through all their pomp of shade; The lordly cedars nod on sacred Lebanon: Tyrant! they cry, since thy fell force is broke, Our proud heads pierce the skies, nor fear the woodman's stroke. I. 3. 1st Epode, Hell from beneath is moved for thee, &amp;c. ver. 9, 10, 11.Hell, from her gulf profound, Rouses at thine approach; and, all around, Her dreadful notes of preparation sound. See, at the awful call, Her shadowy heroes all, Even mighty kings, the heirs of empire wide, Rising, with solemn state, and slow, From their sable thrones below, Meet, and insult thy pride. What, dost thou join our ghostly train, A flitting shadow light, and vain? Where is thy pomp, thy festive throng, Thy revel dance, and wanton song? Proud king! Corruption fastens on thy breast; And calls her crawling brood, and bids them share the feast. II. 1. 2d Strophe, How art thou fallen from Heaven, &amp;c. ver. 12, 13, 14.Oh Lucifer! thou radiant star; Son of the Morn; whose rosy car Flamed foremost in the van of day: How art thou fall'n, thou King of Light! How fall'n from thy meridian height! Who said'st the distant poles shall hear me, and obey. High, o'er the stars, my sapphire throne shall glow, And, as Jehovah's self, my voice the heav'ns shall bow. II 2. 2d Antistrophe, Yet thou shalt be brought down to Hell, &amp;c. ver. 15, 16.He spake, he died. Distain'd with gore, Beside yon yawning cavern hoar, See, where his livid corse is laid. The aged pilgrim passing by, Surveys him long with dubious eye; And muses on his fate, and shakes his reverend head. Just heavens! is thus thy pride imperial gone? Is this poor heap of dust the King of Babylon? II. 3. 2d Epode, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, &amp;c. ver. 16, 17, 18, 19.Is this the man, whose nod Made the earth tremble: whose terrific rod Levell'd her loftiest cities? Where he trod, Famine pursued, and frown'd; 'Till Nature groaning round, Saw her rich realms transform'd to deserts dry; While at his crowded prison's gate, Grasping the keys of fate, Stood stern Captivity. Vain man! behold thy righteous doom; Behold each neighb'ring monarch's tomb; The trophied arch, the breathing bust, The laurel shades their sacred dust: While thou, vile out-cast, on this hostile plain, Moulder'st a vulgar corse, among the vulgar slain. III. 1. 3d Strophe, Thou shalt not be joined to them in burial, &amp;c. ver. 20.No trophied arch, no breathing bust, Shall dignify thy trampled dust: No laurel flourish o'er thy grave. For why, proud king, thy ruthless hand Hurl'd desolation o'er the land, And crush'd the subject race, whom kings are born to save: Eternal infamy shall blast thy name, And all thy sons shall share their impious father's shame. III. 2. 3d Antistrophe, Prepare slaughter for his children, ver. 21, 22.Rise, purple slaughter! furious rise; Unfold the terror of thine eyes; Dart thy vindictive shafts around: Let no strange land a shade afford, No conquer'd nations call them lord; Nor let their cities rise to curse the goodly ground. For thus Jehovah swears; no name, no son, No remnant shall remain of haughty Babylon. III. 3. 3d Epode, Saith the Lord, I will also make it a possession for the bittern, &amp;c. ver. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.Thus saith the righteous Lord: My vengeance shall unsheath the flaming sword; O'er all thy realms my fury shall be pour'd. Where yon proud city stood, I'll spread the stagnant flood; And there the bittern in the sedge shall lurk, Moaning with sullen strain: While, sweeping o'er the plain, Destruction ends her work. Yes, on mine holy mountain's brow, I'll crush this proud Assyrian foe. The irrevocable word is spoke. From Judah's neck the galling yoke Spontaneous falls, she shines with wonted state; Thus by myself I swear, and what I swear is fate. ODE IX. TO AN ÆOLUS'S HARP This instrument was first invented by Kircher about the year 1649. See his Musurgia Universalis, sive ars consoni et dissoni, lib. ix. After having been neglected above a hundred years, it was again accidentally discovered by Mr. Oswald. SENT TO MISS SHEPHEARD. Yes, magic Lyre! now all complete Thy slender frame responsive rings; While kindred notes, with undulation sweet, Accordant wake from all thy vocal strings. Go then to her, whose soft request Bad my blest hands thy form prepare: Ah go, and sweetly sooth her tender breast With many a warble wild, and artless air. For know, full oft, while o'er the mead Bright June extends her fragrant reign, The slumb'ring fair shall place thee near her head, To court the gales that cool the sultry plain. Then shall the sylphs, and sylphids bright, Mild genii all, to whose high care Her virgin charms are given, in circling flight Skim sportive round thee in the fields of air. Some, flutt'ring through thy trembling strings, Shall catch the rich melodious spoil, And lightly brush thee with their purple wings To aid the Zephyrs in their tuneful toil; While others check each ruder gale, Expel rough Boreas from the sky, Nor let a breeze its heaving breath exhale, Save such as softly pant, and panting die. Then, as thy swelling accents rise, Fair Fancy, waking at the sound, Shall paint bright visions on her raptur'd eyes, And waft her spirits to enchanted ground; To myrtle groves, Elysian greens, In which some fav'rite youth shall rove, And meet, and lead her through the glittering scenes, And all be music, extasy, and love. ODE X. When the dramatic poem of Caractacus was altered for theatrical representation in 1776, this dirge was added to be sung over the body of Arviragus. Being of the lyrical cast, the author found himself inclined to preserve it in the series of his Odes, published in 1797. FOR MUSIC. IRREGULAR. I. Lo! where incumbent o'er the shade Rome's rav'ning eagle bows his beaked head; Yet, while a moment fate affords, While yet a moment freedom stays, That moment, which outweighs Eternity's unmeasured hoards, Shall Mona's grateful bards employ To hymn their god-like hero to the sky. II. Radiant Ruler of the day, Pause upon thy orb sublime, Bid this awful moment stay, Bind it on the brow of time; While Mona's trembling echoes sigh To strains, that thrill when heroes die. III. Hear our harps, in accents slow, Breathe the dignity of woe, Solemn notes that pant and pause, While the last majestic close In diapason deep is drown'd: Notes that Mona's harps should sound. IV. See our tears in sober shower, O'er this shrine of glory pour! Holy tears by virtue shed, That embalm the valiant dead; In these our sacred song we steep: Tears that Mona's bards should weep. V. Radiant Ruler, hear us call Blessings on the god-like youth, Who dared to fight, who dared to fall, For Britain, freedom, and for truth. His dying groan, his parting sigh Was music for the gods on high; 'Twas Valour's hymn to Liberty. VI. Ring out, ye mortal strings! Answer, thou heavenly harp, instinct with spirit all, That o'er Andrastes' throne self-warbling swings. There where ten thousand spheres, in measured chime, Roll their majestic melodies along, Thou guidest the thundering song, Poised on thy jasper arch sublime. Yet shall thy heavenly accents deign To mingle with our mortal strain, And heaven and earth unite in chorus high, While freedom wafts her champion to the sky. ODE XI. Printed for the first time 1797. Majestic pile! whose ample eye Surveys the rich variety Of azure hill, and verdant vale; Say, will thy echoing towers return The sighs, that, bending o'er her urn, A Naiad heaves in yonder dale? The pitying Muse, who hears her moan, Smooths into song each gurgling groan, And pleads the Nymph's and Nature's cause; In vain, she cries, has simple taste The pride of formal art defaced, Where late yon height of terras rose; Has vainly bad the lawn decline, And waved the pathway's easy line Around the circuit of the grove, To catch, through every opening glade, That glimmering play of sun and shade, Which peace and contemplation love. Beauty in vain approved the toil, And hail'd the sovereign of the soil, Her own and fancy's favour'd friend; For see, at this ill-omen'd hour, Base art assumes his ancient power, And bids yon distant mound ascend. See, too, his tyrant grasp to fill, In silence swells the pensive rill, That caroll'd sweet the vale along; So swells the throbbing female breast, By wiles of faithless swain oppress'd, When love forbids to speak her wrong. Tell me, chaste Mistress of the Wave! If e'er thy rills refused to lave The plain where now entrench'd they sleep? Would not thy stream at Fancy's call, O'er crags she lifted, fret, and fall, Through dells she shaded, purl, and creep? Yes, thou wert ever fond and free, To pour thy tinkling melody, Sweet pratler, o'er thy pebbled floor; Thy sisters, hid in neighb'ring caves, Would bring their tributary waves, If genuine taste demanded more. Why then does yon clay barrier rise? Behold, and weep, ye lowering skies! Ah rather join in vengeful shower: Hither your wat'ry phalanx lead, And, deeply deluging the mead, Burst through the bound with thunder's roar. So shall the Nymph, still fond and free To pour her tinkling melody, Again her lucid charms diffuse: No more shall mean mechanic skill Dare to confine her liberal rill, Foe to the Naiad and the Muse. ODE XII. TO THE NAVAL OFFICERS OF GREAT BRITAIN. February 11, 1779. Written immediately after the trial of Admiral Keppel, and then printed. I. 1. Hence to thy Hell! thou Fiend accurst, Of Sin's incestuous brood, the worst Whom to pale Death the spectre bore: Alluding to the well-known allegory of Sin and Death, in the second Book of Paradise Lost. Detraction hence! 'tis Truth's command; She launches, from her seraph hand, The shaft that strikes thee to th' infernal shore. Old England's Genius leads her on To vindicate his darling Son, Whose fair and veteran fame Thy venom'd tongue had dar'd defile: The Goddess comes, and all the isle Feels the warm influence of her heav'nly flame. I. 2. But chief in those, their country's pride, Ordain'd, with steady helm, to guide The floating bulwarks of her reign, It glows with unremitting ray, Bright as the orb that gives the day; Corruption spreads her murky mist in vain: To virtue, valour, glory true, They keep their radiant prize in view Ambition's sterling aim; They know that titles, stars, and strings, Bestow'd by kings on slaves of kings, Are light as air when weigh'd with honest fame. I. 3. Hireling courtiers, venal peers View them with fastidious frown, Yet the Muse's smile is theirs, Theirs her amaranthine crown. Yes, gallant Train, on your unsullied brows, She sees the genuine English spirit shine, Warm from a heart where ancient honour glows, That scorns to bend the knee at Interest's shrine. Lo! at your poet's call, To give prophetic fervor to his strain, Forth from the mighty bosom of the main A giant Deity ascends: Down his broad breast his hoary honours fall; He wields the trident of th' Atlantic vast; An awful calm around his pomp is cast, O'er many a league the glassy sleep extends. He speaks; and distant thunder, murmuring round, In long-drawn volley rolls a symphony profound. II. 1. Ye thunders cease! the voice of Heav'n Enough proclaims the terrors given To me, the Spirit of the Deep; Tempests are mine; from shore to shore I bid my billows when to roar, Mine the wild whirlwind's desolating sweep. But meek and placable I come To deprecate Britannia's doom, And snatch her from her fate; Ev'n from herself I mean to save My sister sov'reign of the wave; A voice immortal never warns too late. II. 2. Queen of the Isles! with empire crown'd, Only to spread fair freedom round, Wide as my waves could waft thy name; Why did thy cold reluctant heart Refuse that blessing to impart, Deaf to great Nature's universal claim? Why rush, through my indignant tide, To stain thy hands with parricide? —Ah, answer not the strain! Thy wasted wealth, thy widow's sighs, Thy half-repentant embassies Bespeak thy cause unblest, thy councils vain. II. 3. Sister sov'reign of the wave! Turn from this ill-omen'd war: Turn to where the truly brave Will not blush thy wrath to bear; Swift on th' insulting Gaul, thy native foe, For he is Freedom's, let that wrath be hurl'd; To his perfidious ports direct thy prow, Arm every bark, be every sail unfurl'd; Seize this triumphant hour, When, bright as gold from the refining flame, Flows the clear current of thy Keppel's fame. Give to the hero's full command Th' imperial ensigns of thy naval power; So shall his own bold auspices prevail, Nor Fraud's insidious wiles, nor Envy pale Arrest the force of his victorious band; The Gaul subdued, fraternal strife shall cease, And firm, on Freedom's base, be fixt an empire's peace. ODE XIII. Printed 1797, from an enlarged and corrected copy. While scattering from her seraph wings The heav'nly-tinctur'd dew Whence ev'ry earthly blessing springs, Fair Hope o'er Albion flew, She heard from that superb domain, Where Art has dar'd to fix his reign, Mid shaggy rocks, and mountains wild, A female vot'ry breathe her prayer. She clos'd her plumes, she hush'd the air, And thus replied in accents mild: “What tender warblings to my ear, On zephyrs born, aspire, To draw me from my sapphire sphere, Charm'd by her magic lyre? I come; she wakes the willing strings, With careless grace her hand she flings The soft symphonious chords among; Nor ever on the list'ning plain, Since the sweet Lesbian tun'd her strain, Was heard a more melodious song. “But why to me, fair Syren, wake The supplicating lay? Is it in Hope's vain power to make Thy gaiety more gay? O rather bid me bear my balm Some sable captive's woe to calm, Who bows beneath Oppression's weight; Or sooth those scorn'd, yet faithful few (For much they need my lenient dew) That tremble for Britannia's fate. This marks the time when this Ode was written, viz. towards the conclusion of the American War. “My mirror but reflects the gleam Of distant happiness; They scorn to court a flatt'ring dream, Who present joy possess. The feather'd sov'reign of the sky, Who glories with undazzled eye To meet the sun's meridian rays, Say, will he quit his radiant height, When floating in that sea of light, To flutter in a meteor's blaze? “Art thou not She whom fav'ring Fate In all her splendor drest, To shew in how supreme a state A mortal might be blest? Bade beauty, elegance, and health, Patrician birth, patrician wealth, Their blessings on her darling shed; Bade Hymen of that generous race Who Freedom's fairest annals grace Give to thy love th' illustrious head. “Is there a boon to mortals dear Her fondness has not lent, Ere I could whisper in thy ear ‘The blessing will be sent?’ Obsequious have I e'er denied To wait attendant at thy side, Prepar'd each shade of fear to chace. To antedate each coming joy, And ere the transient bliss could cloy, To bid a livelier take its place. “Nay (blushing I confess the truth) I've hover'd o'er thy head Ev'n when thy too compliant youth, By wayward fashion led, Has left the Muses and thy lyre, To mix in that tumultuous choir, Of purblind Chance the vot'rys pale, Who round his midnight altars stand, And, as the glittering heaps expand, His power with unblest orgies hail. “There Cunning lours, there Envy pines, There Avarice veils his face, Ev'n Beauty's eager eye resigns Its mildly-melting grace; There, as his lots the dæmon throws, Each breast with expectation glows, While heedless Thou of loss or gain, Seest from thy hand that treasure flown That might have hush'd an orphan's moan, Or smooth'd the rugged bed of pain. “O then I spread my wings to fly Back to my sapphire sphere, Resolv'd to leave no ray to dry Thy morn's repentant tear; But when that bright atonement falls, The sight my resolution palls, I haste the liquid gem to save. So still, fair Syren, shall my power Console thee through life's varying hour, Nor will I quit thee at the grave. “O then may white-rob'd Faith appear, With glowing Charity, To spread with mine their wings, and bear Their vot'ry to the sky. Then mingling with our Seraph train, Thy lyre may wake a loftier strain, Where Rapture hymns th' eternal throne; Where to desire is to possess, No wish for more, no fear for less, Where Certainty and I are one.” ODE XIV. Printed separately in May, 1782. TO THE HON. WILLIAM PITT. 1782. ?? ???, ??? ???????? ?????? ?????? ????????????? ???????, ???? ?????? ???? ?????? ???????, ???? ????? ??????. Pindar, Isthm. Ode 11. I 'Tis May's meridian reign; yet Eurus cold Forbids each shrinking thorn its leaves unfold, Or hang with silver buds her rural throne; No primrose shower from her green lap she throws, This expression is taken from Milton's song on May Morning, to which this stanza in general alludes, and the 4th verse in the next. No daisy, violet, or cowslip blows, And Flora weeps her fragrant offspring gone. Hoar frost arrests the genial dew; To wake, to warble, and to woo, No linnet calls his drooping love: Shall then the Poet strike the lyre, When mute are all the feather'd quire, And Nature fails to warm the Syrens of the grove? II He shall: for what the sullen spring denies The orient beam of virtuous youth supplies; That moral dawn be his inspiring flame. Beyond the dancing radiance of the east Thy glory, Son of Chatham! fires his breast, And, proud to celebrate thy vernal fame, Hark, from his lyre the strain ascends, Which but to Freedom's fav'rite friends That lyre disdains to sound. Hark and approve as did thy Sire The Poem of Caractacus was read in MS. by the late Earl of Chatham, who honoured it with an approbation which the Author is here proud to record. The lays which once with kindred fire His Muse in Attic mood, made Mona's oaks rebound. III Long silent since, save when, in Keppel's name, Detraction, murd'ring Britain's naval fame, Rous'd into sounds of scorn th' indignant string. See Ode to the Naval Officers of Great Britain, written 1779. But now, replenish'd with a richer theme, The vase of Harmony shall pour its stream, Fann'd by free Fancy's rainbow-tinctur'd wing. Thy country too shall hail the song, Her echoing heart the notes prolong, While they alone with envy sigh, See the Motto from Pindar. Whose rancour to thy parent dead Aim'd, ere his funeral rites were paid, With vain vindictive rage to starve his progeny. IV From earth and these the Muse averts her view, To meet in yonder sea of ether blue A beam, to which the blaze of noon is pale; In purpling circles now the glory spreads, A host of angels now unveil their heads, While Heav'n's own music triumphs on the gale. Ah see, two white-rob'd Seraphs lead Thy Father's venerable shade; He bends from yonder cloud of gold, While they, the ministers of light, Bear from his breast a mantle bright, And with the Heav'n-wove robe thy youthful limbs enfold. V “Receive this mystic gift, my Son!” he cries, “And, for so wills the Sov'reign of the Skies, “With this receive, at Albion's anxious hour, “A double portion of my patriot zeal, “Active to spread the fire it dar'd to feel “Through raptur'd Senates, and with awful power “From the full fountain of the tongue “To roll the rapid tide along, “Till a whole nation caught the flame. “So on thy Sire shall Heav'n bestow “A blessing Tully fail'd to know, “And redolent in thee diffuse thy Father's fame. VI “Nor thou, ingenious Boy! that fame despise “Which lives and spreads abroad in heav'n's pure eyes, “The last best energy of noble mind, In allusion to a fine and well-known passage in Milton's Lycidas. “Revere thy Father's shade; like him disdain “The tame, the timid, temporizing train, Awake to self, to social interest blind: “Young as thou art, occasion calls, “Thy country's scale or mounts or falls “As thou and thy compatriots strive; “Scarce is the fatal moment past “That trembling Albion deem'd her last: “O knit the union firm, and bid an empire live. VII “Proceed, and vindicate fair Freedom's claim, “Give life, give strength, give substance to her name; “The legal Rights of Man with fraud contest, “Yes, snatch them from Corruption's baleful power, “Who dares, in day's broad eye, those rights devour, “While prelates bow, and bless the harpy feast. “If foil'd at first, resume thy course, “Rise strengthen'd with Antæan force, “So shall thy toil in conquest end. “Let others doat on meaner things, “On broider'd stars, and azure strings, “To claim thy Sov'reign's love, be thou thy country's friend.” VARIATION. The concluding line in this Ode, when first printed, ran thus: “Be thine the Muse's wreath; be thou the people's friend.” But when it was recollected, that very soon after its publication, a person, too well known in the political world, usurped the name of friend of the people, for no better reason than that of promoting his own success in an election contest at Westminster, it will not be wondered at, that the Author should now choose to alter that conclusion. This he has done, not only on moral and prudential, but, he trusts, also on constitutional principles; as he firmly believes, that no Englishman will now (he writes at the conclusion of the year 1795) honour that person with such an appellation, except the very few, who think the people of England and an English mob, synonymous terms. ODE XV. First published on the day of its date. SECULAR. November the Fifth, MDCCLXXXVIII. I It is not Age, creative Fancy's foe, Foe to the finer feelings of the soul, Shall dare forbid the lyric rapture flow: Scorning its chill control, He, at the vernal morn of youth, Who breathed to liberty and truth, Fresh incense from his votive lyre, In life's autumnal eve, again Shall, at their shrine, resume the strain, And sweep the veteran chords with renovated fire. II Warm to his own, and to his country's breast, Twice fifty brilliant years the theme have borne, And each, through all its varying seasons, blest By that auspicious morn, Which gilding Nassau's patriot prow, Gave Britain's anxious eye to know The source whence now her blessings spring; She saw him from that prow descend, And in the hero, hail'd the friend: A name, when Britain speaks, that dignifies her King. III In solemn state she led him to the throne Whence bigot zeal and lawless power had fled, Where Justice fix'd the abdicated crown On his victorious head. Was there an angel in the sky, That glow'd not with celestial joy, When freedom in her native charms, Descended from her throne of light, On eagle plumes, to bless the rite, Recall'd by Britain's voice, restored by Nassau's arms. IV Since then, triumphant on the car of time, The sister years in gradual train have roll'd, And seen the goddess from her sphere sublime, The sacred page unfold, Inscribed by her's and Nassau's hands, On which the hallow'd charter stands, That bids Britannia's sons be free; And, as they pass'd, each white-robed year Has sung to her responsive sphere, Hail to the charter'd rights of British liberty! V Still louder lift the soul-expanding strain, Ye future years! while, from her starry throne Again she comes to magnify her reign, And make the world her own. Her fire e'en France presumes to feel, And half unsheaths the patriot steel, Enough the monarch to dismay, Whoe'er, with rebel pride, withdraws His own allegiance from the laws That guard the people's rights, that rein the sovereign's sway. VI Hark! how from either India's sultry bound, From regions girded by the burning zone, Her all-attentive ear, with sigh profound Has heard the captive moan: Has heard, and ardent in the cause Of all, that free by Nature's laws, The avarice of her sons enthrals; She comes, by Truth and Mercy led, And, bending her benignant head, Thus on the seraph pair in suppliant strain she calls: VII “Long have I lent to my Britannia's hands That trident which controls the willing sea, And bade her circulate to distant lands Each bliss derived from me. Shall then her commerce spread the sail, For gain accursed, and court the gale, Her throne, her sov'reign to disgrace; Daring (what will not Commerce dare!) Beyond the ruthless waste of war, To deal destruction round, and thin the human race? VIII “Proclaim it not before the eternal throne Of him, the sire of universal love; But wait till all my sons your influence own, Ye envoys from above! O wait, at this precarious hour, When in the pendent scale of power My rights and Nature's trembling lie; Do thou, sweet Mercy! touch the beam, Till lightly, as the feather'd dream Ascends the earthly dross of selfish policy. IX “Do thou, fair Truth! as did thy master mild, Who, fill'd with all the power of godhead, came To purify the souls, by guilt defiled, With Faith's celestial flame; Tell them, 'tis Heaven's benign decree That all, of Christian liberty The peace-inspiring gale should breathe. May then that nation hope to claim The glory of the Christian name, That loads fraternal tribes with bondage worse than death? X “Tell them, they vainly grace, with festive joy, The day that freed them from Oppression's rod, At Slavery's mart who barter and who buy The image of their God. But peace!—their conscience feels the wrong; From Britain's congregated tongue, Repentant breaks the choral lay, “Not unto us, indulgent Heaven, “In partial stream be freedom given, “But pour her treasures wide, and guard with legal sway?” ODE XVI. Written in March, 1794, and first printed 1797. PALINODIA. I. 1. Say did I err, chaste Liberty! When warm with youthful fire, I gave the vernal fruits to thee That ripen'd on my lyre? When, round thy twin-born sister's Independency, see Ode, p. 38. shrine, I taught the flowers of verse to twine And blend in one their fresh perfume; Forbade them, vagrant and disjoin'd, To give to every wanton wind Their fragrance and their bloom? I. 2. Or did I err, when, free to choose 'Mid fabling Fancy's themes, I led my voluntary Muse To groves and haunted streams; Disdain'd to take that gainful road, Which many a courtly bard had trod, And aim'd but at self-planted bays? I swept my lyre enough for me, If what that lyre might warble free My free-born friends might praise. I. 3. And art thou mute! or does the fiend that rides Yon sulphurous tube, by tigers drawn, Where seas of blood roll their increasing tides Beneath his wheels while myriads groan, Does he with voice of thunder make reply: “I am the Genius of stern Liberty, “Adore me as thy genuine choice; “Know, where I hang with wreaths my sacred tree, “Power undivided, just equality “Are born at my creative voice?” II. 1. Avaunt, abhorr'd Democracy! O for Ithuriel's spear! To show to Party's jaundiced eye The fiend she most should fear, To turn her from the infernal sight To where, array'd in robes of light, True Liberty on Seraph wing Descends to shed that blessing rare, Of equal rights an equal share To People, Peers, and King. See English Garden, Book IV. v. 685, &amp;c. II. 2. To her alone I rais'd my strain, On her centennial day, Fearless that age should chill the vein She nourish'd with her ray. And what, if glowing at the theme, Humanity in vivid dream, Gave to my mind impatient Gaul (Ah! flattering dream, dismiss'd by fate Too quickly through the ivory gate) Freed from despotic thrall? II. 3. When Ruin, heaving his gigantic mace, (Call'd to the deed by Reason's voice), Crush'd, proud Bastile! thy turrets to their base, Was it not virtue to rejoice? That power alone, whose all-combining eye Beholds, what he ordains, futurity, Could that tremendous truth reveal, That, ere six suns had round the zodiac roll'd Their beams, astonished Europe should behold All Gallia, one immense Bastile? There were in the prisons of Paris alone, when this was written, above 6000 prisoners. III. 1. Is it not virtue to repine, When thus transform'd the scene? “Ah! no,” replied, in strain divine, The heaven-descending Queen. And, as she sung, she shot a ray, Mild as the orient dawn of May, Enlight'ning while it calm'd my brain: “Now purg'd, my Son! from error, own “My blessings ne'er were meant to crown “The vicious, or the vain. III. 2. “'Tis only those of purer clay Cui meliore Luto finxit præcordia Titan. So Milton in his 12th Sonnet, speaking of liberty, says, “But who loves that, must first be wise and good.” “From sensual dross refined, “In whom the passions pleas'd obey “The God within the mind, Mr. Pope uses this Platonic phrase for conscience. —See Essay on Man, Ep. II. p. 204, with Warburton's note upon it, where the learned critic says justly that it admits a double meaning. —It is in its latter practical, or rather Christian sense, that I here employ it, to convey the important truth delivered by St. Paul, “where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.” “Who share my delegated aid, “Through Wisdom's golden mean convey'd “From the first source of sov'reign good: “All else to horrid license tends, “Springs from vindictive pride, and ends “In anarchy and blood. III. 3. “Had France possess'd a sober patriot band, “True to their own, and nation's weal, “Such as, fair Albion, bless'd thy favour'd land, “When Nassau came thy rights to seal; “She might—but why compare such wide extremes, “Why seek for reason in delirious dreams? “Rather consign to exile and to shame “Her coward princes, her luxurious peers, “Who fed the hell-born hydra with their fears, “That now usurps my hallow'd name.” ODE ON WISDOM; The whole 28th chapter of the book of Job, when separated from the context, is a poetical illustration of this truth, “that man is capable of making great advances in the discovery of nature, but as to prying into the secrets of Providence in the government of the world, which is here emphatically called the Wisdom of God, that is above the reach of all creatures.” The first strophe, in the above metrical version, begins at the first verse: “Surely there is a vein for silver and a place for gold;” and proceeds to the 7th. OR, THE TWENTY-EIGHTH CHAPTER OF THE BOOK OF JOB ATTEMPTED IN LYRICAL VERSE, AND ADDRESSED TO THE RIGHT REVEREND RICHARD, LORD BISHOP OF WORCESTER.

Deep in the secret veins of earth, Where each metallic ore has birth, Silver and gold for ages sleep; Blue sapphires there by rocks are veil'd, There crystal springs in grottos seal'd, Unheard, unseen, their useless vigils keep: But man, by fortitude and vigour led, Can cleave the rocks, thro' mountains force his way, Drag the bright sapphires from their murky bed, And bid them rival the meridian ray. Thro' clefts he bursts, can teach the stream to glide, Direct, augment, control its fertilizing tide. I. 2. First antistrophe, ver. 7.

II. 2. Second antistrophe, from ver. 24 to 28. But here the version of Albert Schultens is rather followed, than that of our Bible.'Twas then in solemn synod high, Or ere he plann'd the galaxy, Ere through the heavens one planet roll'd, With her he fix'd all Nature's laws, Creation's first and final cause, And bade her hands th' ideal chart unfold. She saw this vast material orb appear, Bless'd the first pause of elemental strife, When earth, air, water, fire forgot to war, And all was harmony, and light, and life; Saw man produced, while, thund'ring from on high, The Eternal's awful voice proclaim'd his destiny: II. 3. Second epode, ver. 28.

ELEGY I. TO A YOUNG NOBLEMAN LEAVING THE UNIVERSITY. Ere yet, ingenuous Youth, thy steps retire From Cam's smooth margin, and the peaceful vale, Where Science call'd thee to her studious quire, And met thee musing in her cloisters pale; Oh! let thy friend (and may he boast the name) Breathe from his artless reed one parting lay; A lay like this thy early virtues claim, And this let voluntary friendship pay. Yet, know, the time arrives, the dangerous time, When all those virtues, opening now so fair, Transplanted to the world's tempestuous clime, Must learn each passion's boist'rous breath to bear. There, if Ambition, pestilent and pale, Or Luxury should taint their vernal glow; If cold Self-interest, with her chilling gale, Should blast the unfolding blossoms ere they blow; If mimic hues, by Art, or Fashion spread, Their genuine, simple colouring should supply, Oh! with them may these laureate honours fade; And with them (if it can) my friendship die. Then do not blame, if, though thyself inspire, Cautious I strike the panegyric string; The Muse full oft pursues a meteor fire, And, vainly vent'rous, soars on waxen wing. Too actively awake at Friendship's voice, The poet's bosom pours the fervent strain, Till sad reflection blames the hasty choice, And oft invokes Oblivion's aid in vain. Call we the shade of Pope, from that blest bower Where throned he sits, with many a tuneful sage; Ask, if he ne'er bemoans that hapless hour When St. John's name Alluding to this couplet of Mr. Pope's, To Cato Virgil paid one honest line, O let my country's friends illumine mine. illumined Glory's page? Ask, if the wretch, who dared his mem'ry stain, Ask, if his Country's, his Religion's foe Deserved the meed that Marlbro' fail'd to gain, The deathless meed, he only could bestow? The bard will tell thee, the misguided praise Clouds the celestial sunshine of his breast; Even now, repentant of his erring lays, He heaves a sigh amid the realms of rest. If Pope through friendship fail'd, indignant view, Yet pity, Dryden; hark, whene'er he sings, How Adulation drops her courtly dew On titled rhymers and inglorious kings. See, from the depths of his exhaustless mine, His glittering stores the tuneful spendthrift throws; Where fear, or interest bids, behold they shine; Now grace a Cromwell's, now a Charles's brows. Born with too generous, or too mean a heart, Dryden! in vain to thee those stores were lent: Thy sweetest numbers but a trifling art; Thy strongest diction idly eloquent. The simplest lyre, if truth directs its lays, Warbles a melody ne'er heard from thine: Not to disgust with false, or venal praise, Was Parnell's modest fame, and may be mine. Go then, my Friend, nor let thy candid breast Condemn me, if I check the plausive string; Go to the wayward world; complete the rest; Be, what the purest Muse would wish to sing. Be still thyself; that open path of truth, Which led thee here, let manhood firm pursue; Retain the sweet simplicity of youth, And, all thy virtue dictates, dare to do. Still scorn, with conscious pride, the mask of Art; On Vice's front let fearful Caution lower, And teach the diffident, discreeter part Of knaves that plot, and fools that fawn for power. So, round thy brow when Age's honours spread, When Death's cold hand unstrings thy Mason's lyre, When the green turf lies lightly on his head, Thy worth shall some superior bard inspire: He, to the amplest bounds of Time's domain, On Rapture's plume shall give thy name to fly; For trust, with reverence trust this Sabine strain: ? Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori. Horace. “The Muse forbids the virtuous man to die.” Written in 1753. ELEGY II. ADDRESSED TO MISS PELHAM ON THE DEATH OF HER FATHER. He died March 6th, 1754. This Poem was presented to her soon after. At the very beginning of that month the Lady had been with a select party at a small villa in Chiswick, then rented by the Earl of Holdernesse. The Author was, at the time, advised by several of his friends, to publish it; but an Ode, written by Mr. Garrick on the same subject (see Dodsley's Miscellany, Vol. IV. page 198,) had got the start of him. He therefore retained it in manuscript, being by this time sufficiently apprized, that a poem, whose merit rested chiefly on picturesque imagery, and what is termed pure (or mere) poetry, was not calculated to vie, in point of popularity, with what was written in a plainer and less figurative mode, and conveyed in a more familiar style and stanza. First published 1797. Deign, mournful Maid, while o'er yon sacred bier Thy streaming eyes with duteous sorrows flow; Deign, mournful Maid, to lend a list'ning ear To strains, that swell with sympathetic woe. Attend that Muse, who late in happier hour Heard thy soft voice its tuneful pow'rs employ, Where D'Arcy call'd to Chiswick's social bower Mild mirth, and polish'd ease, and decent joy. How did bleak Winter smooth his rugged frown! What genial Zephyrs fann'd each budding spray! How glow'd the Sun, as if in haste to crown The sullen brows of March with wreaths of May! Ah! did we think, while on thy warbling strain Our rapt attention hung with mute delight, That fell disease, that agonizing pain, That Death then sail'd upon the wings of night, To strike that stroke, which not thy breast alone, But ev'ry Briton's honest heart must rend, At which a nation's tears must join thy own, And, whilst you wept a father, weep a friend? Yet such th' irrevocable doom of Jove. Let then that Muse, who shar'd thy happier hour, Now lead thee pensive to the cypress grove, Where pansies spring, and each funereal flower. There, while thy tender hand, his grave to strew, The modest snow-drop's vernal silver bears, The violet sad of pallid purple hue, The crocus glist'ning with the morn's first tears; My bolder arm shall crop the laureat shade; By me the olive and the palm be borne, And from the British oak's majestic head A civic wreath for his illustrious urn. But see! while in the solemn task we join, Soft gleams of lustre tremble through the grove, And sacred airs of minstrelsy divine Are harp'd around, and flutt'ring pinions move. Ah, hark! a voice, to which the vocal rill, The lark's extatic harmony is rude; Distant it swells with many a holy trill, Now breaks wide warbling from yon orient cloud! “Rise, Patriot Shade, on seraph wing upborn! “Behold we waft thee to the realms of rest! “Glory is thine, and Heav'n's eternal morn; “Ascend and share thy blessings with the blest. “Whoe'er on earth, with conscious honour dar'd “Beyond the flight of these inglorious days, “Lords of themselves, here find their bright reward; “And these shall crown thee with congenial rays. “Whoe'er, through private life's domestic scene, “Taught social love to spread its cheerful reign, “Friends of mankind, here bathe in joys serene, “And these shall hail thee 'mid their gentle train. “The few, who bright with public virtue shone, “Who shot the beams of peace from land to land, “Fathers of countries, round the sapphire throne “Shall bow, and welcome Pelham to their band. “Rise, Patriot Shade! on seraph wing upborn, “Behold we waft thee to the realms of rest! “Glory is thine, and Heav'n's eternal morn; “Ascend and share thy blessings with the blest!” ELEGY III. WRITTEN IN THE GARDEN OF A FRIEND. While o'er my head this laurel-woven bower Its arch of glittering verdure wildly flings, Can fancy slumber? can the tuneful power, That rules my lyre, neglect her wonted strings? No; if the blighting east deform'd the plain, If this gay bank no balmy sweets exhal'd, Still should the grove re-echo to my strain, And friendship prompt the theme, where beauty fail'd. For he, whose careless art this foliage drest, Who bade these twisting braids of woodbine bend, He first, with truth and virtue, taught my breast Where best to choose, and best to fix a friend. How well does Mem'ry note the golden day, What time, reclined in Marg'ret's studious glade, My mimic reed first tuned the Dorian lay, Musæus, the first poem in this collection, written while the Author was a scholar of St. John's College in Cambridge. See page 15. “Unseen, unheard, beneath an hawthorn shade?” 'Twas there we met; the Muses hail'd the hour; The same desires, the same ingenuous arts Inspired us both; we own'd, and blest the power That join'd at once our studies, and our hearts. Oh! since those days, when Science spread the feast, When emulative youth its relish lent, Say, has one genuine joy e'er warm'd my breast? Enough; if joy was his, be mine content. To thirst for praise his temperate youth forbore; He fondly wish'd not for a poet's name; Much did he love the Muse, but quiet more, And, though he might command, he slighted Fame. Hither, in manhood's prime, he wisely fled From all that folly, all that pride approves; To this soft scene a tender partner led; This laurel shade was witness to their loves. “Begone,” he cry'd, “Ambition's air-drawn plan; “Hence with perplexing pomp, unwieldy wealth “Let me not seem, but be the happy man, “Possest of love, of competence, and health.” Smiling he spake, nor did the Fates withstand; In rural arts the peaceful moments flew: Say, lovely lawn! that felt his forming hand, How soon thy surface shone with verdure new; How soon obedient Flora brought her store, And o'er thy breast a shower of fragrance flung Vertumnus came; his earliest blooms he bore, And thy rich sides with waving purple hung: Then to the sight, he call'd yon stately spire, He pierced th' opposing oak's luxuriant shade; Bade yonder crowding hawthorns low retire, Nor veil the glories of the golden mead. Hail, sylvan wonders, hail! and hail the hand, Whose native taste thy native charms display'd, And taught one little acre to command Each envied happiness of scene, and shade. Is there a hill, whose distant azure bounds The ample range of Scarsdale's proud domain, A mountain hoar, that yon wild peak surrounds, But lends a willing beauty to thy plain? And, lo! in yonder path I spy my friend; He looks the guardian genius of the grove, Mild as the fabled form See the description of the Genius of the Wood, in Milton's Arcades. For know, by lot, from Jove, I am the power Of this fair wood, and live in oaken bower; To nurse the saplings tall, and curl the grove With ringlets quaint, &amp;c. that whilom deign'd, At Milton's call, in Harefield's haunts to rove. Blest Spirit, come! though pent in mortal mould, I'll yet invoke thee by that purer name; Oh come, a portion of thy bliss unfold, From Folly's maze my wayward step reclaim. Too long, alas, my inexperienc'd youth, Misled by flattering Fortune's specious tale, Has left the rural reign of peace and truth, The huddling brook, cool cave, and whispering vale. Won to the world, a candidate for praise, Yet, let me boast, by no ignoble art, Too oft the public ear has heard my lays, Too much its vain applause has touch'd my heart; But now, ere Custom binds his powerful chains, Come, from the base enchanter set me free; While yet my soul its first, best taste retains, Recall that soul to reason, peace, and thee. Teach me, like thee, to muse on Nature's page, To mark each wonder in Creation's plan, Each mode of being trace, and, humbly sage, Deduce from these the genuine powers of man; Of man, while warm'd with reason's purer ray, No tool of policy, no dupe to pride; Before vain Science led his taste astray; When conscience was his law, and God his guide. This let me learn, and learning let me live The lesson o'er. From that great guide of truth Oh may my suppliant soul the boon receive To tread through age the footsteps of thy youth. Written in 1758. ELEGY IV. This Elegy was prefixed to the former editions of Caractacus, as dedicatory of that poem. TO THE REV. MR. HURD. Friend of my youth, who, when the willing Muse Stream'd o'er my breast her warm poetic rays, Saw'st the fresh seeds their vital powers diffuse, And fed'st them with the fost'ring dew of praise! Whate'er the produce of the unthrifty soil, The leaves, the flowers, the fruits, to thee belong: The labourer earns the wages of his toil; Who form'd the Poet, well may claim the song. Yes, 'tis my pride to own, that taught by thee My conscious soul superior flights essay'd; Learnt from thy lore the Poet's dignity, And spurn'd the hirelings of the rhyming trade. Say, scenes of Science, say, thou haunted stream! [For oft my Muse-led steps did'st thou behold] How on thy banks I rifled every theme, That Fancy fabled in her age of gold. How oft' I cried, “Oh come, thou tragic Queen! “March from thy Greece with firm majestic tread! “Such as when Athens saw thee fill her scene, “When Sophocles thy choral Graces led: “Saw thy proud pall its purple length devolve; “Saw thee uplift the glitt'ring dagger high; “Ponder with fixed brow thy deep resolve, “Prepared to strike, to triumph, and to die. “Bring then to Britain's plain that choral throng; “Display thy buskin'd pomp, thy golden lyre; “Give her historic forms the soul of song, “And mingle Attic art with Shakspeare's fire.” “Ah, what, fond boy, dost thou presume to claim?” The Muse replied: “Mistaken suppliant, know, “To light in Shakspeare's breast the dazzling flame “Exhausted all Parnassus could bestow. “True; Art remains; and, if from his bright page “Thy mimic power one vivid beam can seize, “Proceed; and in that best of tasks engage, “Which tends at once to profit, and to please.” She spake; and Harewood's towers spontaneous rose Soft virgin warblings echo'd through the grove; And fair Elfrida pour'd forth all her woes, The hapless pattern of connubial love. More awful scenes old Mona next display'd; Her caverns gloom'd, her forests wav'd on high, While flamed within their consecrated shade The genius stern of British liberty. And see, my Hurd! to thee those scenes consign'd; Oh! take and stamp them with thy honour'd name. Around the page be friendship's chaplet twin'd; And, if they find the road to honest Fame, Perchance the candour of some nobler age May praise the Bard, Nil equidem feci (tu scis hoc ipse) theatris: Musa nec in plausus ambitiosa mea est. Ovid. Trist. Lib. V. El. vii. 23. who bade gay Folly bear Her cheap applauses to the busy stage, And leave him pensive Virtue's silent tear: Chose too to consecrate his fav'rite strain To him, who, grac'd by ev'ry liberal art That best might shine among the learned train, Yet more excell'd in morals and in heart: Whose equal mind could see vain fortune shower Her flimsy favours on the fawning crew, While, in low Thurcaston's sequester'd bower, She fix'd him distant from Promotion's view; Yet, shelter'd there by calm Contentment's wing, Pleased he could smile, and, with sage Hooker's eye, “See from his mother earth God's blessings spring, “And eat his bread in peace and privacy.” Verbatim from a letter of Hooker's to Archbishop Whitgift. “But, my Lord, I shall never be able to finish what I have begun,” [viz. his immortal Treatise on Ecclesiastical Polity] “unless I be removed into some quiet country parsonage, where I may see God's blessings spring out of my mother earth, and eat my own bread in peace and privacy.” See his Life in the Biographia Britannica. Written in 1759. ELEGY V. ON THE DEATH OF A LADY. The midnight clock has toll'd; and hark, the bell Of Death beats slow! Heard ye the note profound? It pauses now; and now, with rising knell, Flings to the hollow gale its sullen sound. Yes, ? is dead. Attend the strain, Daughters of Albion! ye that, light as air, So oft have tript in her fantastic train, With hearts as gay, and faces half as fair: For she was fair beyond your brightest bloom (This Envy owns, since now her bloom is fled) Fair as the forms, that, wove in Fancy's loom, Float in light vision round the Poet's head. Whene'er with soft serenity she smil'd, Or caught the orient blush of quick surprise, How sweetly mutable, how brightly wild, The liquid lustre darted from her eyes? Each look, each motion wak'd a new-born grace, That o'er her form its transient glory cast: Some lovelier wonder soon usurp'd the place, Chas'd by a charm still lovelier than the last. That bell again! It tells us what she is: On what she was no more the strain prolong: Luxuriant Fancy pause: an hour like this Demands the tribute of a serious song. Maria claims it from that sable bier, Where cold and wan the slumberer rests her head; In still small whispers to Reflection's ear, She breathes the solemn dictates of the dead. Oh catch the awful notes, and lift them loud; Proclaim the theme, by sage, by fool rever'd; Hear it, ye young, ye vain, ye great, ye proud! 'Tis Nature speaks, and Nature will be heard. Yes, ye shall hear, and tremble as ye hear, While high with health, your hearts exulting leap: Ev'n in the midst of Pleasure's mad career, The mental monitor shall wake and weep. For say, than ?'s propitious star, What brighter planet on your births arose; Or gave of Fortune's gifts an ampler share, In life to lavish, or in death to lose! Early to lose; while born on busy wing, Ye sip the nectar of each varying bloom: Nor fear, while basking by the beams of spring, The wint'ry storm that sweeps you to the tomb. Think of her fate! revere the heav'nly hand That led her hence, though soon, by steps so slow; Long at her couch Death took his patient stand, And menac'd oft, and oft withheld the blow: To give Reflection time, with lenient art, Each fond delusion from her soul to steal; Teach her from Folly peaceably to part, And wean her from a world she lov'd so well. Say, are ye sure his mercy shall extend To you so long a span? Alas, ye sigh: Make then, while yet ye may, your God your friend, And learn, with equal ease to sleep or die! Nor think the Muse, whose sober voice ye hear, Contracts with bigot frown her sullen brow; Casts round Religion's orb the mists of fear, Or shades with horrors, what with smiles should glow. No; she would warm you with seraphic fire, Heirs as ye are of heav'n's eternal day; Would bid you boldly to that heav'n aspire, Not sink and slumber in your cells of clay. Know, ye were form'd to range yon azure field, In yon ethereal founts of bliss to lave; Force then, secure in Faith's protecting shield, The sting from Death, the vict'ry from the Grave. Is this the bigot's rant? Away ye vain, Your hopes, your fears, in doubt, in dulness steep: Go sooth your souls in sickness, grief, or pain, With the sad solace of eternal sleep. Yet will I praise you, triflers as ye are, More than those preachers of your fav'rite creed, Who proudly swell the brazen throat of war, Who form the phalanx, bid the battle bleed; Nor wish for more: who conquer, but to die. Hear, Folly, hear; and triumph in the tale: Like you, they reason; not, like you, enjoy The breeze of bliss, that fills your silken sail: On Pleasure's glitt'ring stream ye gaily steer Your little course to cold Oblivion's shore: They dare the storm, and, through th' inclement year, Stem the rough surge, and brave the torrent's roar. Is it for glory? that just Fate denies. Long must the warrior moulder in his shroud, Ere from her trump the heav'n-breath'd accents rise, That lift the hero from the fighting crowd. Is it his grasp of empire to extend? To curb the fury of insulting foes? Ambition, cease: the idle contest end: 'Tis but a kingdom thou canst win or lose. In a book of French verses, entitled Oeuvres du Philosophe de sans Souci, and lately reprinted at Berlin, by authority, under the title of Poesies Diverses, may be found an epistle to Marshal Keith, written professedly against the immortality of the soul. By way of specimen of the whole, take the following lines: De l'avenir, cher Keith, jugeons par la passé; Comme avant que je fusse il n'avoit point pensé, De même, après ma mort, quand toutes mes partes Par la corruption seront aneanties, Par un même destin il ne pensera plus; Non, rien n'est plus certain, soyons-en convaincu, &amp;c. It is to this epistle, that the rest of the Elegy alludes. And why must murder'd myriads lose their all, (If life be all) why desolation lour, With famish'd frown, on this affrighted ball, That thou may'st flame the meteor of an hour? Go wiser ye, that flutter life away, Crown with the mantling juice the goblet high; Weave the light dance, with festive freedom gay, And live your moment, since the next ye die. Yet know, vain sceptics, know, th' Almighty mind, Who breath'd on Man a portion of his fire, Bade his free soul, by earth nor time confin'd, To Heav'n, to immortality aspire. Nor shall the pile of Hope, his Mercy rear'd, By vain Philosophy be e'er destroy'd: Eternity, by all or wish'd or fear'd, Shall be by all or suffer'd or enjoy'd. Written in 1760. ELEGY VI. WRITTEN IN A CHURCH-YARD IN SOUTH WALES, 1787. A custom is prevalent with the peasants in that part of the country, of planting field flowers and sweet herbs on the graves of their relations and friends; a pleasing specimen of this which the Author saw when he was paying a visit to Lord Vernon at Breton Ferry, Glamorganshire, in the summer of the year 1787, occasioned him to write this Elegy, first published 1797. From southern Cambria's richly-varied clime, Where grace and grandeur share an equal reign; Where cliffs o'erhung with shade, and hills sublime Of mountain lineage sweep into the main; From bays, where Commerce furls her wearied sails, Proud to have dar'd the dangers of the deep, And floats at anchor'd ease inclos'd by vales, To Ocean's verge where stray the vent'rous sheep: From brilliant scenes like these I turn my eye; And, lo! a solemn circle meets its view, Wall'd to protect inhum'd mortality, And shaded close with poplar and with yew. Deep in that dell the humble fane appears, Whence prayers if humble best to Heaven aspire; No tower embattled, no proud spire it rears, A moss-grown croslet decks its lowly choir. And round that fane the sons of toil repose, Who drove the plough-share, or the sail who spread; With wives, with children, all in measur'd rows, Two whiten'd flint stones mark the feet and head. While these between full many a simple flow'r, Pansy, and pink, with languid beauty smile; The primrose opening at the twilight hour, And velvet tufts of fragrant chamomile. For, more intent the smell than sight to please, Surviving love selects its vernal race; Plants that with early perfume feed the breeze May best each dank and noxious vapour chase. The flaunting tulip, the carnation gay, Turnsole, and piony, and all the train That love to glitter in the noontide ray, Ill suit the copse where Death and Silence reign. Not but perchance to deck some virgin's tomb, Where violets sweet their twofold purple spread, Some rose of maiden blush may faintly bloom, Or with'ring hang its emblematic head. These to renew, with more than annual care That wakeful love with pensive step will go; The hand that lifts the dibble shakes with fear Lest haply it disturb the friend below. Vain fear! for never shall disturber come Potent enough to wake such sleep profound, Till the dread herald to the day of doom Pours from his trump the world-dissolving sound. Vain fear! yet who that boasts a heart to feel, An eye to pity, would that fear reprove? They only who are curst with breasts of steel Can mock the foibles of surviving love. Those foibles far beyond cold Reason's claim Have power the social charities to spread; They feed, sweet Tenderness! thy lambent flame, Which, while it warms the heart, improves the head. Its chemic aid a gradual heat applies That from the dross of self each wish refines, Extracts the liberal spirit, bids it rise Till with primeval purity it shines. Take then, poor peasants, from the friend of Gray His humbler praise; for Gray or fail'd to see, Or saw unnotic'd, what had wak'd a lay Rich in the pathos of true poesy. Yes, had he pac'd this church-way path along, Or lean'd like me against this ivied wall, How sadly sweet had flow'd his Dorian song, Then sweetest when it flow'd at Nature's call. Like Tadmor's king, his comprehensive mind Each plant's peculiar character could seize; And hence his moralizing This epithet is used to call to the reader's recollection a passage in Shakspeare, descriptive of a character to which in its best parts Mr. Gray's was not dissimilar. Duke Sen. But what said Jaques? Did he not moralize this spectacle? First Lord. O yes, into a thousand similies. As you like it. Act II. Scene I. Muse had join'd, To all these flow'rs, a thousand similies. But he, alas! in distant village-grave Has mix'd with dear maternal dust his own; Ev'n now the pang, which parting Friendship gave, Thrills at my heart, and tells me he is gone. Take then from me the pensive strain that flows Congenial to this consecrated gloom; Where all that meets my eye some symbol shows Of grief, like mine, that lives beyond the tomb. Shows me that you, though doom'd the livelong year For scanty food the toiling arm to ply, Can smite your breasts, and find an inmate there To heave, when Mem'ry bids, the ready sigh. Still nurse that best of inmates, gentle swains! Still act as heartfelt sympathy inspires; The taste, which birth from Education gains, Serves but to chill Affection's native fires. To you more knowledge than what shields from vice Were but a gift would multiply your cares; Of matter and of mind let reasoners nice Dispute; be Patience, yours, Presumption theirs. You know (what more can earthly Science know?) That all must die; by Revelation's ray Illum'd, you trust the ashes placed below These flow'ry tufts, shall rise again to day. What if you deem, by hoar tradition led, To you perchance devolv'd from Druids old, That parted souls at solemn seasons tread The circles that their shrines of clay enfold? What if you deem they some sad pleasure take These poor memorials of your love to view, And scent the perfume for the planter's sake, That breathes from vulgar rosemary and rue? Unfeeling Wit may scorn, and Pride may frown; Yet Fancy, empress of the realms of song, Shall bless the decent mode, and Reason own It may be right—for who can prove it wrong? Although I run the risk of some imputed vanity, I am induced to add here, the opinion of a too partial friend concerning the foregoing Poem; but shall only extract from the written paper which he gave me, the part that points out the specific differences which occurred to him, when he compared it with another of a very similar title. And this I do merely to obviate a prejudice which some readers might take to it, as supposing from the title and subject that I wrote it to emulate what, I am as ready to own as they are, is inimitable. “Your Elegy, (says this Gentleman) as it relates to a particular and local custom in South Wales, must of course little resemble Mr. Gray's, which is purely of a general kind. He laments the departed peasants; you compassionate those that lament them: he places their former occupations in an honourable light; you view, in an amiable one, the weakness of their surviving friends: in the former Elegy, we find the dead considered with respect to what their possible situation while living might have been, with all the advantages of knowledge; in the latter the living are endeavoured to be consoled for the want of it. In the general church-yard of the one, contemplation is more widely-extended; in the other particular one, concern is more nearly impressed. His verses inspire a solemnity which awes and arrests the mind; your's breathe a tenderness which softens and attracts the heart: there are stanzas in Gray's Elegy of what, I venture to call, sublime melancholy; in your's of extreme sensibility.—It is a curious circumstance that the writer of the former should be introduced into both these Elegies, but certainly, as reality is superior to fiction, in a more pathetic manner in the latter. The locality of your scene enabled you to open with a picturesque description, which, besides contrasting strongly with the place of interment, is copied from nature, and animated with expression.”—I will add, that it was not so much for the sake of this kind of contrast that I gave the Elegy such an exordium, as to make it appear a day scene, and as such to contrast it with the twilight scene of my excellent Friend's Elegy.

TO THE RIGHT REVEREND THE BISHOP OF LICHFIELD AND COVENTRY, PREFIXED TO THE DRAMATIC POEM OF CARACTACUS, WHEN ALTERED FOR STAGE REPRESENTATION. Still let my Hurd a smile of candour lend To scenes, that dar'd on Grecian pinions tow'r, When, “in low Thurcaston's sequester'd bow'r,” See the conclusion of the 3d Elegy, p. 104 of this Volume. He prais'd the strain, because he lov'd the friend: There golden Leisure did his steps attend, Nor had the rare, yet well-weigh'd, call of Power To those high cares decreed his watchful hour, On which fair Albion's future hopes depend. He was then Preceptor to the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York. A fate unlook'd-for waits my friend and me; He pays to Duty what was Learning's claim, Resigning classic ease for dignity; I yield my Muse to Fashion's praise or blame: Yet still our hearts in this great truth agree, That Peace alone is bliss, and Virtue fame. Aston, Nov. 12, 1776. SONNET V. TO A VERY YOUNG PAINTER. When Genius first on Attic walls display'd His imitative powers, four simple hues Were all that great Apelles deign'd to use: See Plinii Nat. Hist. Lib. XXXV. Cap. 15, the pigments he enumerates were black, white, yellow, and red, as appears from the following passage, “Quatuor coloribus solis immortalia opera illa fecere; ex albis, Melino; ex silaceis, Attico; ex rubris, Sinopide Pontica; ex nigris, Atramento:” Apelles, Echion, Melanthius, Nicomachus, Clarissimi Pictores; quum tabulæ eorum singulæ oppidorum venirent opibus. The authority of my late excellent friend Sir Joshua Reynolds fully supports the latter piece of advice, who in his second Discourse to the Pupils of the Royal Academy (see page 54, 8 vo. edition) says, “What therefore I wish to impress upon you is this, that whenever an opportunity offers you may paint your studies instead of drawing them. This will give you such a facility in using colours, that they will arrange themselves under the pencil, even without the attention of the hand that conducts it. If one art excluded the other, this advice could not, with any propriety, be given; but if painting comprises both drawing and colouring, and if by a short struggle of resolute industry the same expedition is attainable in painting, as in drawing on paper, I cannot see what objection can justly be made to the practice, or why that should be done in parts, which may be done altogether.” Let me add from myself, that I suspect the use of a multiplicity of pigments, and the prohibition of the pencil (hereafter to be the artist's principal instrument) till the port-crayon has been first long and sedulously employed, have frequently been great impediments to the progress of young artists, especially of those who are endowed by nature with an inventive faculty. With these combin'd he to each eye convey'd, By magic force of colouring light and shade, His miracles of Grace; while every Muse Attun'd her lyre, impatient to diffuse His fame in vivid verse, that scorns to fade: These then, ingenuous Boy, alone prepare; From these all Nature's tints arrange with care; With these produce each shadow, light, and line, And, while they all thy mix'd attention share, Chastely to paint, correctly to design, Deem but one art, and let that art be thine. SONNET VI. TO GEORGE BUSSY VILLIERS EARL OF JERSEY, &amp;c. &amp;c. AND GEORGE SIMON HARCOURT EARL HARCOURT, &amp;c. &amp;c. Ye gen'rous pair, who held the Poet dear, Whose blameless life my friendly pen pourtrays, Accept, with that combin'd, his latest lays, While still young Fancy sports in diction clear; And may propitious Fate their merit bear To times, when Taste shall weave the wreaths of praise By modes disdain'd in these fantastic days; Such wreaths as classic heads were proud to wear. But if no future ear applauds his strain, If mine alike to Lethe's lake descends, Yet, while aloof, on Mem'ry's buoyant main, The gale of Fame your genuine worth extends, Still shall our names this fair distinction gain, That Villiers and that Harcourt call'd us friends.

No! for the foes of all life-lengthen'd men, Trouble and toil, See Psalm xc. ver. 10. approach not yet too near; Reason, meanwhile, and health, and memory dear Hold unimpair'd their weak, yet wonted reign: Still round my shelter'd lawn I pleas'd can stray; Still trace my sylvan blessings to their spring: Being of Beings! Yes, that silent lay, Which musing Gratitude delights to sing, Still to thy sapphire throne shall Faith convey, And Hope, the Cherub of unwearied wing. SONNET VIII. First published 1797. FEBRUARY 23, 1796. ANNIVERSARY. In the long course of seventy years and one, Oft have I known on this, my natal day, Hoar frost, and sweeping snow prolong their sway, The wild winds whistle, and the forests groan; But now spring's smile has veil'd stern winter's frown; And now the birds on ev'ry budding spray Chaunt orisons, as to the morn of May: With them all fear of season's change is flown; Like them I sing, yet not, like them beguil'd, Expect the vernal bloom of youth to know: But, though such hope be from my breast exil'd, I feel warm Piety's superior glow, And as my winter, like the year's, is mild, Give praise to Him, from whom all mercies flow.

What! when the step of even-footed time Has led me one and seventy years along, Dare I attempt a second birth-day song, And bid it tinkle in Petrarchian chime? Shall I, impeded by the knots of rhyme, Venture to shoot the warp of verse among My blunted shuttle? Be it right or wrong, I'll try, yet keep from pathos or sublime; For Hurd, the critic of my youthful lay, And yet Right Reverend Censor, cries “Forbear! “Age should avoid, like Infancy, to play “With pointed tools; a Sonnet once a year, “Or so, my nod permits thee to essay.” Duteous I bow, yet think the doom severe. Aston, Feb. 23, 1796. SONNET X. Now first printed. FEBRUARY 23, 1797. ANNIVERSARY. Again the year on easy wheels has roll'd To bear me to the term of seventy-two. Yet still my eyes can seize the distant blue Of yon wild Peak, and still my footsteps bold, Unprop'd by staff, support me to behold How Nature, to her Maker's mandate true, Calls Spring's impartial heralds to the view, The snow-drop pale, the crocus spik'd with gold; And still (thank Heav'n) if I not falsely deem, My Lyre, yet vocal, freely can afford Strains not discordant to each moral theme Fair Truth inspires, and aid me to record, (Best of poetic palms!) my Faith supreme In thee, my God, my Saviour, and my Lord!

First published 1797. TO A GRAVEL WALK, RELATIVE TO THE PRECEDING SUBJECT. Smooth, simple Path! whose undulating line, With sidelong tufts of flow'ry fragrance crown'd, “Plain in its neatness,” A phrase that Milton uses to express simplex munditiis. See his translation of Hor. Ode V. Lib. I. Mr. T. Warton, in his edition of Milton's Poems, criticises the expression. It is however Milton's, and, if it does not fully express Horace's meaning, seems to serve my purpose perfectly. spans my garden ground; What, though two acres thy brief course confine, Yet sun and shade, and hill and dale are thine, And use with beauty here more surely found, Than where, to spread the picturesque around, Cart ruts and quarry holes their charms combine! See Mr. Price's Description of a Picturesque Lane. Here, as thou lead'st my step through lawn or grove, Liberal though limited, restrain'd though free, Fearless of dew, or dirt, or dust, I rove, And own those comforts, all deriv'd from thee! Take then, smooth Path, this tribute of my love, Thou emblem pure of legal liberty! Aston, Nov. 27, 1795. SONNET XIII. First published 1797. OCCASIONED BY A DIDACTIC POEM ON THE PROGRESS OF CIVIL SOCIETY. Old as I am, I yet have powers to sneer At him, who dares debase the gold of Gray With his vile dross, and by such base allay, Hope to buy off the critic's frown severe; Him too, whose page e'erwhile had dar'd appear With shameless front the symbols to display Of Pagan rites obscene, and thence convey Shame to each eye, profaneness to each ear. Methinks, through Fancy's tube, my friend I spy Thron'd on a cloud in yon etherial plain, “Smiling in scorn;” methinks, I hear him cry, “Prosaic Poetaster, cease to drain “The filthy dregs of Epicurus' sty; “They shall not mix with my nectareous strain!” What Mr. Gray thought and writ (see his Detached Thoughts, printed in his Memoirs, Vol. III. p. 113, last edition) gives complete authority to this Prosopopæia. “The doctrine of Epicurus is ever ruinous to society. It had its rise when Greece was declining, and, perhaps, hastened its dissolution, as also that of Rome. It is now propagated in France and in England, and seems likely to produce the same effects in both.” May heaven avert, at least, the latter part of this presentiment formed above forty years ago! EPITAPHS AND INSCRIPTIONS. EPITAPH I. ON MRS. MASON, IN THE CATHEDRAL OF BRISTOL. Take, holy earth! all that my soul holds dear: Take that best gift which Heav'n so lately gave: To Bristol's fount I bore with trembling care Her faded form: she bow'd to taste the wave, And died. Does Youth, does Beauty, read the line? Does sympathetic fear their breasts alarm? Speak, dead Maria! breathe a strain divine: Ev'n from the grave thou shalt have power to charm. Bid them be chaste, be innocent, like thee; Bid them in Duty's sphere as meekly move; And if so fair, from vanity as free; As firm in friendship, and as fond in love. Tell them, though 'tis an awful thing to die, ('Twas ev'n to thee) yet the dread path once trod, Heav'n lifts its everlasting portals high, And bids “the pure in heart behold their God.” EPITAPH II. ON MISS DRUMMOND, IN THE CHURCH OF BRODSWORTH, YORKSHIRE. Here sleeps what once was Beauty, once was Grace; Grace, that with tenderness and sense combin'd To form that harmony of soul and face, Where beauty shines the mirror of the mind. Such was the Maid, that in the morn of youth, In virgin innocence, in Nature's pride, Blest with each art that owes its charm to truth, Sunk in her Father's fond embrace, and died. He weeps: Oh venerate the holy tear: Faith lends her aid to ease affliction's load; The Parent mourns his Child upon her bier, The Christian yields an Angel to his God. EPITAPH III. ON JOHN DEALTRY, M. D. IN THE CATHEDRAE OF YORK. Here o'er the tomb, where Dealtry's ashes sleep, See Health, This inscription alludes to the design of the sculpture, which is a figure of Health, with her ancient insignia, in alto relievo, dropping a chaplet on the side of a monumental urn. in emblematic anguish weep! She drops her faded wreath; “No more,” she cries, “Let languid mortals, with beseeching eyes, “Implore my feeble aid: it fail'd to save “My own and Nature's guardian from the grave.” EPITAPH IV. ON MRS. TATTON, IN THE CHURCH OF WITHENSHAW IN CHESHIRE. If e'er on earth true happiness were found 'Twas thine, blest Shade! that happiness to prove; A father's fondest wish thy duty crown'd, Thy softer virtues fix'd a husband's love. Ah! when he led thee to the nuptial fane, How smil'd the morning with auspicious rays! How triumph'd Youth, and Beauty, in thy train, And flatt'ring Health that promis'd length of days! Heav'n join'd your hearts. Three pledges of your joy Were giv'n, in thrice the years revolving round— Here, Reader! pause; and own, with pitying eye, That “not on earth true happiness is found.” EPITAPH V. ON MR. GRAY, IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY. No more the Grecian Muse unrivall'd reigns, To Britain let the nations homage pay; She felt a Homer's fire in Milton's strains, The cenotaph is placed immediately under that of Milton, and represents, in alto relievo, a female figure with a lyre, as emblematical of the higher kinds of poetry, pointing with one hand to the bust above, and supporting with the other a medallion, on which is a profile head inscribed, “Thomas Gray.” On the plinth is the following date; “He died July 31, 1771.” The sculpture was executed by that eminent artist Mr. Bacon, in Newman-street, at the joint expense of Dr. James Browne, Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge; Richard Stonhewer, Esq. Auditor of Excise; and the Author. A Pindar's rapture from the lyre of Gray. EPITAPH VI. ON THOMAS FOUNTAYNE, ESQ. ONLY SON OF THE DEAN OF YORK, IN THE CHURCH OF MELTON, YORKSHIRE. O here, if ever, holy Patience bend Thy duteous knee! the hand of Heav'n revere! Here bid the father, mother, sister, friend In mute submission drop the christian tear! Nor blame, that in the vernal noon of youth The buds of manly worth, whose opening bloom Had glow'd with Honour, Fortitude, and Truth, Sunk in th' eternal winter of the tomb: That he, whose form with health, with beauty charm'd, For whom fair Fortune's liberal feast was spread, Whom Science nurtur'd, bright example warm'd, Was torn by ling'ring torture to the dead. “Hark!” cries a voice that awes the silenc'd air, “The doom of man in my dread bosom lies; “Be your's awhile to pace this vale of care, “Be his to soar with seraphs in the skies.” EPITAPH VII. This and the foregoing Epitaph, with some others, come under that stricture, which Dr. Johnson has imposed on several of Mr. Pope's. The Author knows, but despises it. Personal appellatives in Greek appear gracefully in the Anthologia. In English poetry they almost constantly induce an air of vulgarity. That species of criticism, therefore, which either in the verse or prose of any language militates against what Horace calls its jus et norma loquendi, he holds to be futile. Besides this, when, on a monumental tablet, a prose inscription precedes (as is ever the modern mode) the verses, why should these be loaded with any unnecessary repetition? ON LAUNCELOT BROWNE, ESQ. IN THE CHURCH OF FEN-STANTON, HUNTINGDONSHIRE. Ye Sons of Elegance; who truly taste The simple charms which genuine Art supplies, Come from the sylvan scenes his Genius grac'd, And offer here your tributary sighs: But know, that more than Genius slumbers here; Virtues were his, that Art's best powers transcend: Come, ye superior train! who these revere, And weep the Christian, Husband, Father, Friend! EPITAPH VIII. ON MRS. ANN E. MORRITT, IN THE CHURCH OF SELBY, DISTINGUISHED FOR COPYING, IN NEEDLE-WORK, SEVERAL PICTURES OF SOME OF THE FIRST ARTISTS. Blest Shade, whose Genius in thy earliest days Fir'd thee to emulate the Pencil's praise, To seize the Painter's powers without the name, And soar on female attributes to Fame! Her works, deservedly admired, are now in the possession of J. B. S. Morritt, Esq. at Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. This verse records how to those powers were join'd The strongest manliest energies of mind, Records those years of pain thy frame sustain'd With patience firm, with Love and Faith unfeign'd, And Hope, that ever hov'ring o'er thy head, The brilliant palm of bliss eternal spread. INSCRIPTION IX. ON A TRIPOD TO THE MEMORY OF WILLIAM WHITEHEAD, ESQ. P. L. IN THE PLEASURE GROUND OF EARL HARCOURT, NEWNAM, OXFORDSHIRE. Harcourt and Friendship this memorial rais'd Near to the oak, where Whitehead oft reclin'd; Where all that Nature, rob'd by Art, displays With charms congenial sooth'd his polish'd mind. Let Fashion's votaries, let the Sons of Fire Alluding to an expression of his in his Charge to the Poets, which excited the rancour of Churchill, Lloyd, &amp;c. See Memoirs of his Life, page 108. The genius of that modest Bard despise, Who bad Discretion regulate his lyre, Studious to please, yet scorning to surprise. Enough for him if those, who shar'd his love Through life, who virtue more than verse revere, Here pensive pause, when circling round the grove, And drop the heart-paid tribute of a tear. INSCRIPTION X. UNDER A PICTURE OF THE EDITOR OF SHAKSPEARE'S MANUSCRIPTS, 1796. PARODY. Four Forgers, born in one prolific age, Much critical acumen did engage. The first was soon by doughty Douglas scar'd, Though Johnson would have screen'd him, had he dar'd; When Lauder first produced his forgery respecting Milton, Dr. Johnson ushered it into the world by a preface, and afterwards writ Lauder's recantation. Some of his numerous biographers have endeavoured to prove the Doctor no party concerned; however this be, the virulence he afterwards shewed to Milton in the Life which he writ of him for the booksellers, leads fairly to support my assertion, that he would have defended Lauder, had he been in any sort defensible. The translator of Fingal, Temora, &amp;c.The next had all the cunning of a Scot The discoverer and transcriber of Rowley's Poems.The third invention, genius—nay, what not? Fraud, now exhausted, only could dispense To her fourth son, their three-fold impudence. MISCELLANIES. THE BIRTH OF FASHION: AN EPISTOLARY TALE. WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1746, AND SENT TO A LADY WITH HOLLAR'S HABITS OF ENGLISH WOMEN, PUBLISHED IN THE FORMER CENTURY 1650. I wish this verse may chance to come Just as you dress for rout, or drum; If so, while Betty at your back Or pins your gown, The phrase at the time was pinning a lady's tail; but the young Author was then too delicate to use it: and happy it was he did not; for the present nicer age would have thought him as indelicate as Lord Monboddo. However an excellent anecdote related of Mrs. Russel, bedchamber-woman to the late Princess Amelia, which is by many remembered (though not here related) will vindicate the authenticity of what was then the usual phrase to express the adjustment of a most material part of a lady's dress. or folds your sacque, Dear Madam, let me beg you place These prints between yourself and glass, To see the change in female dress Made in a hundred years, or less. “Sure, Sir, our grandames all were mad! “What vulgar airs the creatures had! “The awkward things—not half a waist; “And that all frightfully unlac'd— “O monstrous! what a shocking taste?” What a strange objection is here put into the lady's mouth! she finds fault with the women in Charles the First's time for having only half a waist; when every body knows, that to have no waist at all is the true criterion of female elegance. As to lacing, who now could imitate the Venus de Medicis, or any other fine antique, that admitted so gothic a ligament. Just so indeed I did surmise You would not fail to criticise; Yet still I cannot help conceiving, If one of these good dames was living And saw that five-yard hoop around ye, Her shrewd reflections might confound ye: But whatsoe'er her thoughts might be, They'd have but little weight with me; For I opine, 'tis clear as light, Whatever is in dress is right; The present is the test of taste, And awkward ev'ry thing that's past: Thus we dislike, observe the proof, Both Anna's flounce, and Besse's ruff; Yet there's a time the Muse pronounces, When hoops shall be like ruffs and flounces. Part of the prophecy seems to have been fulfilled, so far at least as starched ruffs go, though the male (I rather call them so than the masculine) followers of Fashion have found a mode of adding to the size of their own necks not quite so picturesque; and the ladies have, occasionally in their morning dishabilles, condescended to imitate them. As to flounces, they have extended their dominion even to bed curtains and hangings of rooms: this, I suppose, out of charity to the insect tribe, for whom they afford a general and most convenient nidus. For in an uniform progression Each mode a moment takes possession Of Beauty's throne, and fills the place, Attended by each charm and grace; Yet, when depos'd by some new fashion, The charms and graces keep their station, And on the next thron'd whimsy wait With all the self-same form and state. So, at Culloden's furious fray Had Charley's broad swords won the day, Which, Heav'n be thank'd, was not the case, Some statesmen still had kept their place, And many wights, I name no names, Who swore to George, had sworn to James. This bold assertion, I take for granted, was made merely on hear-say evidence. Readers at the present time will be best able to judge whether that evidence was founded on truth. This granted, it no longer strange is, That Fashions in their various changes, Though e'er so odd, and out o' the way, Should reign with universal sway. For why—whatever mode takes place 'Tis just the same in point of grace. A tale like Prior or Fontaine Will make the thing extremely plain. Cyprus was once, the learn'd agree, The Vauxhall of Antiquity: Her myrtle groves, and laurel shades Echo'd with constant serenades, And Grecian belles, that look'd as pretty, And mov'd as graceful as Auretti, A celebrated opera dancer then in vogue. With Grecian beaus the live-long day, Or led the dance, or tun'd the lay. Blest place! and how could it be other, Where all were rul'd by Cupid's mother? Nay, 'tis affirm'd, the Queen in person Would oft partake of the diversion; And then incog. for fear of scandal, And lest her pranks might give a handle To Pallas, and such sour old maids; So when she visited the shades, She wisely laid aside the goddess, And dress'd in round-ear'd cap and boddice. I suspect that the young Author now, and before in this epistle, took his idea of female shape and beauty from Fielding's Description of Fanny in his Adventures of Joseph Andrews; an idea, which, compared with what it is now, was in that author as absurd, as in himself. One day, thus mask'd, she took her way Along the margin of the sea, Where in a creek (convenient spot) The sea-nymphs had contriv'd a grot. As here she sat, and humm'd a song, She saw a boat row smooth along, Ah! what a lovely freight it bore! A youth of eighteen years, or more, Whose polish'd brow, and rosy cheek, Love-glist'ning eye, and graceful neck, With locks, that wanton'd in the wind, Brought all Adonis to her mind! Yet not like that rough woman-hater; No, he was half a petit-maitre; For dress improv'd his native bloom, Dress fit for any drawing-room, All Tyrian silk, and silver tissue. Well, he arriv'd, and mark the issue— He bow'd, saluted, prais'd the dame, Said civil things, confess'd his flame. She chose to go—He begg'd she'd stay; But begg'd with such a winning way, Was all so pressing, and so fervent, So much her poor expiring servant, That, need I say, he won the dame. Here, Muse, to give no cause for blame, We'll drop the curtain, and agree To sing a harmless Hymenèe. O! shower, ye crimson roses, shower Perfumes ambrosial where they lie, With clouds of fragrance veil the bower, Thick veil from each intruding eye. Blow soft, ye Zephyrs —Hark a noise! What malice interrupts their joys? O! heav'ns! the darling youth is fled: She grasps a meteor in his stead. A lion pawing o'er the plain, Now “rampant shakes his brindled mane,” And now a stream meand'ring laves The golden sand, now joins the waves. Though I do not find it on the margin of the original MS. the Author had an eye to Virgil in the peculiar changes the mock lover employs: —Ille suæ contra non immemor artis, Omnia transformat sese in miracula rerum, Ignemque horribilem feram, fluviumque liquentem. Georg. Lib. IV. ver. 440. What shall affrighted Venus do? The youth was Proteus; see him now Resume his form marine again, And rise from out the circling main, Encircled with his scaly train! “'Tis not,” he cried, and archly smil'd, “The first good time you've been beguil'd, “So, lovely Goddess, wipe your eye, “And listen to my prophecy: “Know, 'tis decreed, you soon shall bear “A daughter, pre-ordain'd to share “The various powers we have between us, “And change like Proteus, please like Venus: “With Gods she'll have some hard Greek name, “But Fashion men will call the dame.” This said, he plung'd beneath the flood; The Goddess prudently thought good To hush the matter up, and hie To private lodgings in the sky; And oft, though Juno begg'd she'd come To Mount Olympus to her drum, This is the second time we meet with this obsolete word, yet it will serve with many others in the Poem to ascertain its exact chronology. Yet she refus'd; would ne'er be seen, But had the head-ach, nerves, and spleen. Spleen—another obsolete word. Nerves however obtains still most vehemently, though, perhaps, it may in time give place to spasms, whatever the author of Zoonomia may say of their non-existence. I doubt if any modern knows How many months a goddess goes; But 'tis enough, the reck'ning ended, The babe was born, the mother mended: Nor shall I spend much vain description To show she hit her Sire's prediction; For to a lady learn'd as you All history will prove it true: Yet if you had but less discerning, The Muse might here show monstrous learning; Describe in Greece what tricks she play'd, And how she taught each Spartan maid To show her legs (ingenious thought) By well-chose slits in petticoat, Which, did she run, or dance, or stoop, Reveal'd as much as any hoop. Then might she soar on Roman wing, Of Stola and of Palla sing; With critic nicety explore What kind of hoods their matrons wore; How broad Lucretia's tucker spread; How Ovid's Julia dress'd her head, And better ascertain these matters, Than all the herd of commentators. Next might she by due steps advance To modern scenes; and first to France: France is her citadel, and there The Goddess keeps her arms and car. Here the boy pedant comes again from his Virgil with ? Hic illius arma Hic Currus fuit. —Æn. Lib. I. v. 20. And thence she sends her vice-roy apes To form our uncouth English shapes. Here Pegasus might run his race O'er Mecklin, and o'er Brussels lace: Here might he take Pindaric bounces O'er floods of furbelows and flounces; Gallop on lutestring plains, invade The thick-wove groves of rich brocade, And leap o'er whale-bone's stiff barrier. Whale-bone and brocade equally exploded articles. —But here I bridle his career, And sagely think it more expedient To sign myself your most obedient. IL BELLICOSO. This very juvenile imitation of the Allegro and Penseroso of Milton, and that which follows it, were written some time previous to that of the Lycidas. (See Poem I. of this Volume.) A copy of the above was many years ago surreptitiously printed in a magazine, and afterwards inserted in Pearch's Miscellany. On this account, I thought it right to revise and now publish it (1797.) The counterpart to it was, with my assent, first printed in the Cambridge Verses on the Peace of Aix la Chappelle; and stands here as it did formerly. Hence, dull lethargic Peace; Born in some hoary beadsman's cell obscure, Or in Circean bower, Where Manhood dies, and Reason's vigils cease. Hie to congenial climes; Prolong some Eastern tyrant's downy reign, Or on Italian plain, Mid citron shades and myrtle-vested bow'rs, Lull thine ambrosial hours, And wed enervate trills to tinkling rhymes. But rouse, thou God, by furies drest In helm with terror-plumed crest, In adamantine steel bedight, Glist'ring formidably bright, With step unfixt, and aspect wild, Jealous Juno's raging child, Who thee conceiv'd in Flora's bower, By touch of rare Olenian flower. So called from Olenas, a city in Peloponesus, where, according to Ovid, this flower first grew. The story is told by him in his Fasti. Lib. V. v. 231. Oft the Goddess sigh'd in vain, Envying Jove's prolific brain, And oft old Ocean heard her moan, Bending from his coral throne; At length through Flora's groves she stray'd, Kind Flora lent her fragrant aid; Then fruitful grown, her ivory car With harness'd peacocks cut the air, And circling wide Propontis round, She lands at length on Thracian ground; There teems thee forth, of nervous mould, Haughty, sanguine, fierce, and bold; Names thee Mars, and bids thee call The world from Pleasure's silken thrall. Come, thou Genius of the War, Roll me in thine iron car, And as thy coursers pierce the sky, Breathing fury as they fly, Let Courage hurry swift before, All stain'd around with purple gore, And Vict'ry follow close behind With wreath of palm and laurel join'd, While high in ether Fame assumes Her place, and waves her eagle plumes. Then, whilst her trumpet swells the note Roaring rough through brazen throat, Let drums, with many a beat maintain, The measure of the martial strain; Hautboys, clarions too be found, Nor be miss'd the fife's shrill found, Nor yet the Scottish bag-pipes strain, Dear delight of Highland swain; Whether on some mountain's brow Now squeaking high, now droning low, It guides the steps of many a lass Tripping it featly on the grass; Or whether in the battle's fray Some ancient Caledonian lay It boldly blows, to fill the train With fury mixt with proud disdain, Strike ev'ry fire from ev'ry mind, Nor leave one latent spark behind. Bear me now to tented ground, Where gallant streamers wave around, And British ensigns, wide display'd, Lend the earth a scarlet shade, And pikes, and spears, and lances bright Dart around a silver light; There to join the hardy crowd, As they sport in gamesome mood, Wrestling on the circled ground, Wreathing limbs with limbs around; Or see them pitch the massy bar, Or teach the disk to whiz in air. Then, at night's return, regale With chat full blunt, and chirping ale, While some voice of manly bass Sings my darling Chevy Chase; How the child, that's yet unborn, May rue Earl Percy's hound and horn; How Witherington, in doleful dumps, Fought right valiant on his stumps; And many a knight and 'squire full gay At morn, or night, were clad in clay; While first and last, we join to sing, “God prosper long our noble King.” Thus, till midnight spreads around Her sable vestments o'er the ground, Then, I'll for a studious seat To some strong citadel retreat, By ditch and rampart high ypent, And batt'ry strong, and battlement. There in some store-room richly dight, With coats of mail, and falchions bright, Emblazon'd shields of impress quaint, Erst borne at tilt and tournament; There while the taper burneth blue (As Brutus once was wont to do) Let me turn the ample page Of some grave, historic sage; Or in Homer's sacred song, Mix the Grecian bands among, Or list to Virgil's epic lyre, Or lofty Lucan's wrapt in fire, But rather still let Shakspeare's muse Her genuine British flame diffuse; And briskly with her magic strain Hurry me to Gallic plain, What time the gallant Talbot bleeds, Or when heav'n-prosper'd Harry leads His bands, with sevenfold courage steel'd, To Agincourt's immortal field. Yet soon as morn begins to spread The orient pale with streaming red, And the shrill cornets from afar Stoutly swell the note of war; Then, as th' embattled files advance, O Mars! my ev'ry thought entrance. Guide me, thou terrific God! Guide through glory's arduous road, While Conquest, with gigantic pace Stalks before, and shakes his mace; While hailing bullets round me fly, And human thunders rend the sky, With armour clanking, clarions sounding, Cannons bellowing, shouts rebounding, “Guide me, thou terrific God! “Guide through glory's arduous road.” But, should on land thy triumphs cease, Still bear me from the scenes of peace; Me lead, dread power! for warlike sport To some wave-encircled fort, Or, if it yield more open sight, To some hoar promontory's height, Whose high-arch'd cliff, with bending brow, Frowns on the foaming surge below; There eagerly to ken from far, All the burst of naval war, And glow with sympathetic rage, While th' embattled fleets engage, And ev'ry distant shore rebounds To their cannons rattling sounds; When the sulphurous fire-ship rends, And thousand deaths around her sends, And limbs dissever'd, hurl'd on high, Smoke amid th' affrighted sky. But, while I gaze, if envious night Shuts the grand prospect from my sight, Still let thy vot'ry hear from far The sound of elemental war, Hark to the distant thunder's roll, Nor, till its last concluding growl, Permit dull Morpheus to apply His leaden finger to my eye; And then, even then, let Fancy's power Exhaust her visionary store, To paint some mighty city's state Besieg'd, and nodding to its fate; Above whose heav'n-devoted fanes, Portentous comets sweep their trains, And vultures, fierce in martial'd flight, With beaks and claws wage bloody fight; And armed knights, a ghostly crowd, Prick forth from ev'ry op'ning cloud With blazing swords of portent dire, And minute glares of meteor fire; Such erst as shot their livid gleam, Down on besieg'd Jerusalem, Or hung o'er Rome e'er Julius fell, And, if old sages truly spell, Are dread prognostics that foreshow, Convulsions in our realms below. And, when at last cold creeping age Freezes the current of my rage, Let me retire amidst a troop Of invalids, a veteran group, Bereft of some main limb by war, Or justly proud to show the scar They gain'd, when fighting in the cause Of Albion's liberty and laws; With these full cheerly I'll retire, To circle round a sea-coal fire, Hear them their past campaigns recite Of Vigo's sack and Blenheim fight. And, when my children round me throng, The same brave themes shall grace my tongue, To teach them, should fair England need Their blood, 'tis their's to wish to bleed; And, as I speak, behold them glow, And flash their eye, and knit their brow; While I, with heart-felt bliss elate, Sit proudly in paternal state, Gaze on each half-form'd warrior face, And all their future fortunes trace; That this, my ruddy, first-born boy On land his Sov'reign shall employ; The next o'er Ocean's wide domain Boldly assert Britannia's reign, And firm in freedom's cause advance The scourge of slav'ry, and of France. These delights if Mars afford, Mars! with thee I whet my sword. Written in 1744. IL PACIFICO. Hence, pestilential Mars, Of sable-vested Night and Chaos bred, On matter's formless bed, Mid the harsh din of elemental jars: Hence with thy frantic crowd, Wing'd Flight, pale Terror, Discord cloth'd in fire, Precipitate retire; While mad Bellona cracks her snaky thong, And hurries headlong on, To Ach'ron's brink and Phlegethon's flaming flood. But hail, fair Peace, so mild and meek, With polish'd brow and rosy cheek, That, on thy fleece-white cloud descending, Hither, soft-ey'd Queen, art tending, Gently o'er thy fav'rite land To wave thy genial myrtle wand: To shake from off thy turtle wing Th' ambrosial dews of endless spring; Spring, like that which poets feign, Gilded Saturn's easy reign: For Saturn's first-born daughter thou; Unless, as later bards avow, The youthful God with spangled hair Closely clasp'd Harmonia fair: For, banish'd erst Heav'n's star-pav'd floor, (As sings my legendary lore) As Phœbus sat by weeping brook, With shepherd's scrip and shepherd's crook, Pensive 'midst a savage train (For savage then was all the plain) Fair Harmonia left her bow'r, To join her radiant paramour: Hence didst thou spring; and at thy birth Lenient Zephyrs fann'd the earth, Rumbling thunders growl'd no more, Prowling wolves forgot to roar, And man, whom fiercer rage possest, Smil'd dissension from his breast. She comes, she comes: ye Nymphs, prepare Gay floral wreaths to bind your hair; Ye swains, inspire the mellow flute To dulcet strains, which aptly suit The featly-footed saraband Of Phillis trim and Marian bland, When nimbly light each simp'ring lass Trips it o'er the pliant grass. But see, her social smiling train Now invests th' enraptur'd plain! Plenty's treasure-teeming horn Show'rs its fruits, its flow'rs, its corn; Commerce spreads his amplest sail; Strong-nerv'd Labour lifts his flail Sylvanus too attends, ('tis he That bears the root-pluck'd cypress tree) He shall my youngling footsteps lead Through tufted lawn and fringed mead, By scooped valley, heaped hill, Level river, dancing rill, Where the shepherds all appear, To sheer and wash their fleecy care, Which bleating stand the streams around, And whiten all the close-cropp'd ground: Or when the maids in bonnets sheen Cock the hay upon the green; Or up yon steep rough road the swains Drive slow along their rolling wains, (Where laughing Ceres crowns the stack, And makes the pond'rous axle crack), Then to the village on the hill, The barn's capacious jaws to fill, Where the answ'ring flails rebound Beating bold with thund'ring sound. Enchanted with this rural scene, Here let me weave my arb'retts green: Here arch the woodbine, mantling neat O'er my noontide cool retreat; Or bind the oak with ivy-twine; Or wed the elm and purpling vine. But, if my vagrant fancy pants For charms that simple nature wants, Grant, Power benign, admittance free To some rang'd academy: There to give to arts refin'd All the impulse of my mind; And oft observant take my stand, Where the painter's magic hand From sketches rude, with gradual art, Calls dawning life to ev'ry part, Till, with nice tints all labour'd high, Each starting hero meets the eye: Oft too, oh! let me nice inspect The draughts of justest architect: And hence delighted let me pass, Where others mold the ductile brass; Or teach the Parian stone to wear A letter'd sage's musing air. But ah! these Arts have fix'd their home In Roman or in Gallic dome: Though strange beseems, that Arts should spread Where frowns black Slav'ry's baleful shade; And stranger far that Arts decay Where Freedom deals her warmest ray. This then deny'd; I'll swift retreat, Where Camus winds with murmur sweet: There teach me, piercing Locke, t' explore The busy mind's ideal store; There, heav'n-rapt Newton, guide my way 'Mid rolling worlds, through floods of day, To mark the vagrant comet's road, And through his wonders trace the God. Then, to unbend my mind, I'll roam Amid the cloister's silent gloom: Or, where rang'd oaks their shades diffuse, Hold dalliance with my darling Muse, Recalling oft some heav'n-born strain, That warbled in Augustan reign; Or turn, well pleas'd, the Grecian page, If sweet Theocritus engage; Or blith Anacreon, mirthful wight, Caroll his easy love-lay light. Yet let not all my pleasure lie Confin'd to one Phœbeian joy; But ever give my fingers wings Lightly to skim the trembling strings, And from some bow'r to tune the lay: While list'ning birds crowd every spray, Or hovering silent o'er my head, Their quiv'ring wings exulting spread; Save but the turtles, they alone With tender plaintive faithful moan, Shall tell, to all the secret grove, Their soft thick-warbled tale of love: Sweet birds! your mingling bliss pursuing, Ever billing, ever cooing, Ye! constant pair! I love to note Your hoarse strain gurgling in your throat; And, ye unheard, from sidelong hills The liquid lapse of whisp'ring rills, I hist to hear: such sounds diffuse Sweet transports to the thoughtful Muse. Thus Summer sees me brisk and light, 'Till Winter spreads her 'kerchief white; Then to the city's social walls, Where tolling clock to business calls. There the weaver's shuttle speeds Nimbly through the fine-spun threads: There the vocal anvil rings, While the smith his hammer swings; And ev'ry man and ev'ry boy Briskly join in warm employ. Through such throng'd scenes full oft I'll range, Oft crowd into the rich Exchange: Or to yon wharf; aside the mote, Where the anchor'd ships do float, And others, hast'ning into bay, Swell their sails in fair array: Wafting to Albion's sons the store, That each Peruvian mine can pour; Wafting to Albion's smiling dames The ruby's glow, the diamond's flames, 'Till all the Indies rush into the Thames. Joys vast as these my fancy claims; And joys like these, if Peace inspire, Peace with thee I string the lyre. AN EPISTOLARY ADDRESS TO THE AUTHOR'S FATHER, SENT FROM LONDON IN THE YEAR 1746. First printed 1797. Surgat in officium venerandi Musa Parentis Miltonus ad Patrem. Here pause, fair Fancy, Alluding to Musæus and the two foregoing imitations of Milton, which the Author was then composing, but had not quite finished. in thy flow'ry way The varied verse, the imitative lay Reject awhile; discard each fabling dream; Paternal praise be now thy nobler theme; And if the Muse, who through the realms of song Gave Pope, now mute, to lead the tuneful throng, In whose warm heart with mingling fervour shone The glowing Poet and the tender Son, His duteous heart and filial feelings pour Through every artless line, I ask no more. Enough for me, if he, whose name I bear, With wonted candour bend his partial ear; Enough, if he who always lov'd to blend Advice with smiles, the father with the friend, Accept the verse, how vain soe'er it prove, Which aims to pay its tribute to the love, That ever blest me since my course began, From tender childhood to the dawn of man; Nor in that course did e'er one boon refuse, A son might ask, and innocence might use. Can I forget, when first my infant ear Caught each new melody it chanc'd to hear, How prompt to foster seeds, that nature sow'd, A master skill'd his gen'rous care bestow'd, To teach how concord and how discord meet, And form one strain methodically sweet? Alike when active Fancy tried to trace The rural landscape, or impassion'd face, How to my aid he brought each written rule, And free design of Painting's various school? How, when my thoughts first flow'd in tinkling chime, He smooth'd the verse, reform'd each faulty rhyme, Nor check'd the Muse, just waking, in the strain, Lest love of verse should quench the love of gain, But smil'd assenting, fann'd the kindling fire, And sunk the critic in the partial sire? Much thanks for these; for arts like these have pow'r To grace the chearful, sooth the peusive hour. These shall dispense their calm, yet lively, joys, When study pauses, or when business cloys; Nor one dull hour drawl sullenly along, While paint can please, or harmony, or song. Thro' graver science now my steps to guide, As years advance, see Marg'ret's dome supply'd Her arching cloysters and her glimm'ring groves, All, study claims, all, contemplation loves, Are amply given; and, if I wish for more, The town expands, and Thames, thy splendid shore! Here free to rove, here feast my mind and eyes, “Here catch the manners living as they rise,” Here men with books impartially compare, Learn what they should be, smile at what they are; For Vanity, the world's despotic queen, Ere we can know her truly, must be seen; And if plain sense her steady glass supplies, The more we see, the more we shall despise. Permit me then, my Sire, awhile to view, Thro' that clear perspective, her motley crew; Nor fear thy son, by Fashion's frippery smit, Should shun the Christian and pursue the Wit: But sated quite, relinquishing with joy Those vain delights, that soon as tasted cloy; Each passion cool'd, that boils the tide of youth, Each error purg'd, that dims the sight of truth, O! may no wish for more his bosom own, But all his manners speak him all thy son. For, know, each academic duty paid, Soon will he haste to his paternal shade; There, fraught (great task) with Reason's nerve to tame That hydra of the soul the thirst of fame; His youthful breast, by years mature refin'd, May shine the mirror of thy blameless mind, And, free from public, as domestic, strife, Slide thro' the tranquil stream of private life; Yet, still alive to ev'ry social call, Glow with that charity, which feels for all. There too to truths divine may he aspire, Wing'd and conducted by his practis'd Sire: Pursue his flight, upborn on Faith's strong plume, Nor fear of youthful Icarus the doom, From Falsehood's maze sav'd by his guiding clue, Rise as he rises, keep him still in view, The Minotaur of Vice beneath him hurl'd, And 'scap'd that worst of labyrinths, the World. STANZAS, WRITTEN ON THE BANKS OF THE CAM, 1746. To court, in May's mild month, the Muse Along the sedgy bank I stray'd, Where slow-pac'd Cam his course pursues Amid the daisy-painted mead. High o'er my head, the Solar sphere Flung far and wide his sparkling beams; His sparkling beams as bright appear Reflected from the silver streams. Below each languid Zephyr died, Each slender reed forgot to play, Without a rill the even tide Slided silently away. Yet, from its surface to its base, So clear the chrystal fluid spread, My gazing eye, distinct could trace The finny inmates of its bed. At length the Muse her votary join'd, With me the busy scene she view'd, And, fancy waking in my mind, A flow of numbers thus ensued. “See, how those rose-finn'd perch delight “High as th' incumbent air to glide, “Each leaf each straw their chase excite, “That bouyant sail along the tide. “On Learning's surface thus the youth “Too oft devotes each precious hour, “For modern whim scorns ancient truth, “And quits the fruit, to smell the flower. “But hark! I heard a bubbling noise, “How quick yon trout pursu'd a fly! “Yet see! the nimble insect plies “His wing, and safe ascends the sky. “Say, Muse! to what shall we compare “The scaly fool's successless aim? “Tis thus that all deluded are, “Who merely act, or write for fame. “See far below, yon eel conceal'd “In mud its circling volume leads, “Now thro' the water half reveal'd, “Now tangled in a grove of reeds; “So fares the man, who, gravely vain, “Thro' each profound of Learning wanders, “Scruples and doubts perplex his brain “In long and intricate meanders. “There too a half-gorg'd pike appears, “Whose maw or frogs or gudgeons sate, “After a labouring length of years, “Such is the musty pedant's fate. “But see, its height and depth between, “Yon scaly tribe or pause or play, “Now hanging in the fluid scene, “Now straying as its currents stray; “Their course no straws divert above, “No mud, or reeds obstruct below, “Freely their oary fins they move, “As nature dictates, swift or slow. “So, through life's current let me glide, “Nor sink too low, nor rise too high, “Safe if Content my progress guide, “And golden Mediocrity.” ISIS. It was said, in an advertisement prefixt to the first quarto edition, that, “the following Poem would never have appeared in print, had not an interpolated copy of it, published in a country newspaper, scandalously misrepresented the principles of the Author;” which parody, before the publication of the original, was reprinted in the London Evening Post, and generally supposed to be written by the late Dr. Byrom of Manchester. Very soon after Mr. T. Warton, afterwards Poet Laureat, printed an elegant answer to it, entitled, the Triumph of Isis. But ere this the Author (then young) was convinced that the satire it contained, though mixed as it was with true panegyric, was too severe; he therefore forbore to reprint it in any of the former editions of his Poems. However, as Mr. Warton's Poem has been, with this reprinted in certain Miscellanies, and as the former holds a place in his volume, it it was thought proper here to give it a place.—Certain it is that the spirit of Jacobitism, which had obtained in both our Universities before the year 1745, was far from being quite extinguished in 1748, when this Poem was written. May the more recent spirit of Jacobinism (if now it infects either of them) have a still quicker termination! (re-published 1797). A MONOLOGUE. It was originally entituled an Elegy; but the term is altered as not being written in alternate rhymes, which since Mr. Gray's exquisite Elegy in the Country Church-yard has generally obtained, and seems to be more suited to that species of Poem. ? ???????? ?? ???? ?? ?? ??? ???? ??????????, ???? ?????????- ??? ?????? ??????, ??? ?? ???????? ?????????. Sophocles in Antig. Far from her hallow'd grot, where mildly bright The pointed crystals shot their trembling light, From dripping moss where sparkling dew-drops fell, Where coral glow'd, where twin'd the wreathed shell, Pale Isis lay; a willow's lowly shade Spread its thin foliage o'er the pensive maid; Clos'd was her eye, and from her heaving breast In careless folds loose fell her zoneless vest; While down her neck her vagrant tresses flow In all the awful negligence of woe; Her urn sustain'd her arm, that sculptur'd vase Where Vulcan's art had lavish'd all it's grace; Here, full with life was heav'n-taught Science seen, Known by the laurel wreath and musing mein: There cloud-crown'd Fame, here Peace sedate and bland Swell'd the loud trump, and wav'd the olive wand; While solemn domes, arch'd shades, and vistas green At well-mark'd distance close the sacred scene. On this the Goddess cast an anxious look, Then dropt a tender tear, and thus she spoke: “Yes, I cou'd once with pleas'd attention trace The mimic charms of this prophetic vase; Then lift my head, and with enraptur'd eyes View on yon plain the real glories rise. Yes, Isis! oft hast thou rejoic'd to lead Thy liquid treasures o'er yon fav'rite mead, Oft hast thou stopt thy pearly car to gaze, While every science nurs'd its growing bays: While ev'ry youth, with Fame's strong impulse fir'd, Prest to the goal, and at the goal untir'd Snatch'd each celestial wreath to bind his brow, The Muses, Graces, Virtues could bestow. “E'en now fond Fancy leads the ideal train, And ranks her troops on Mem'ry's ample plain; See! the firm leaders of my patriot line, See! Sidney, Raleigh, Hamden, Somers shine. See Hough superior to a tyrant's doom Smile at the menace of the slave of Rome. Each soul whom Truth could fire, or Virtue move, Each breast strong panting with its country's love, All that to Albion gave the heart or head, That wisely counsell'd, or that bravely bled, All, all appear; on me they grateful smile, The well-earn'd prize of every virtuous toil To me with filial reverence they bring, And hang fresh trophies o'er my honour'd spring. “Ah! I remember well yon beachen spray, There Addison first tun'd his polish'd lay; 'Twas there great Cato's form first met his eye, In all the pomp of free-born majesty. “My Son, he cry'd, observe this mein with awe, “In solemn lines the strong resemblance draw; “The piercing notes shall strike each British ear, “Each British eye shall drop the patriot tear; “And, rous'd to glory by the nervous strain, “Each youth shall spurn at Slav'ry's abject reign, “Shall guard with Cato's zeal Britannia's laws, “And speak, and act, and bleed, in Freedom's cause.” The Hero spoke, the Bard assenting bow'd, The lay to liberty and Cato flow'd; While Echo, as she rov'd the vale along, Join'd the strong cadence of his Roman song. “But ah! how Stillness slept upon the ground, How mute Attention check'd each rising sound; Scarce stole a breeze to wave the leafy spray, Scarce trill'd sweet Philomel her softest lay, When Locke walk'd musing forth; ev'n now I view Majestic Wisdom thron'd upon his brow, View Candour smile upon his modest cheek, And from his eye all Judgment's radiance break. 'Twas here the Sage his manly zeal exprest, Here stript vain Falsehood of her gaudy vest; Here Truth's collected beams first fill'd his mind, Ere long to burst in blessings on mankind; Ere long to show to Reason's purged eye, That “Nature's first best gift was Liberty.” “Proud of this wond'rous son, sublime I stood, (While louder surges swell'd my rapid flood) Then vain as Niobe exulting cry'd, Ilissus! roll thy fam'd Athenian tide; Though Plato's steps oft mark'd thy neighb'ring glade, Though fair Lycæum lent its awful shade, Though ev'ry academic green imprest Its image full on thy reflecting breast, Yet my pure stream shall boast as proud a name, And Britain's Isis flow with Attic fame. “Alas! how chang'd! where now that Attic boast? See! Gothic Licence rage o'er all my coast. See! Hydra Faction spread its impious reign, Poison each breast, and madden ev'ry brain. Hence frontless crowds that, not content to fright The blushing Cynthia from her throne of night, Blast the fair face of day; and madly bold, To Freedom's foes infernal orgies hold; To Freedom's foes, ah! see the goblet crown'd! Hear plausive shouts to Freedom's foes resound! The horrid notes my refluent waters daunt, The Echoes groan, the Dryads quit their haunt; Learning, that once to all diffus'd her beam, Now sheds by stealth a partial private gleam In some lone cloister's melancholy shade, Where a firm few support her sickly head; Despis'd, insulted by the barb'rous train, Who scour, like Thracia's moon-struck rout, the plain, Sworn foes like them to all the Muse approves, All Phœbus favours, or Minerva loves. “Are these the sons my fost'ring breast must rear? Grac'd with my name, and nurtur'd by my care, Must these go forth from my maternal hand To deal their insults through a peaceful land, And boast, while Freedom bleeds and Virtue groans, That “Isis taught sedition to her sons?” Forbid it heav'n! and let my rising waves Indignant swell, and whelm the recreant slaves, In England's cause their patriot floods employ, As Xanthus delug'd in the cause of Troy. Is this deny'd? Then point some secret way Where far far hence these guiltless streams may stray, Some unknown channel lend, where nature spreads Inglorious vales and unfrequented meads; There, where a hind scarce tunes his rustic strain, Where scarce a pilgrim treads the pathless plain, Content I'll flow; forget that e'er my tide Saw yon majestic structures crown its side; Forget that e'er my rapt attention hung Or on the Sage's or the Poet's tongue, Calm and resign'd my humbler lot embrace, And pleas'd prefer oblivion to disgrace.” PROTOGENES AND APELLES. The exquisite humour with which Prior has enlivened the plain tale which he took from Pliny, it is hoped will not be much impaired by the following few alterations, attempted for no other purpose than to elucidate the original story, which it is thought, has not hitherto been perfectly understood; not from any defect in Pliny's narrative (as his last translator, M. Falconet would make us believe), but from the blunder of the old Commentators, and the inattention of the latter to the whole passage. The alterations are printed in italics, and Prior's original lines at the bottom of the respective pages. (ALTERED FROM PRIOR.) When Poets wrote, and Painters drew, As Nature pointed out the view; Ere Gothic forms were known in Greece, To spoil the well-proportioned piece; And in our verse ere monkish rhymes Had jangled their fantastic chimes; Ere on the flow'ry land of Rhodes Those Knights had fix'd their dull abodes, Who knew not much to paint or write, Nor car'd to pray, nor dar'd to fight: Protogenes, historians note, Liv'd there, a burgess scot and lot; And, as old Pliny's writings show, Apelles did the same at Co. Agreed these points of time and place, Proceed we in the present case. Piqu'd by Protogenes's fame, From Co to Rhodes Apelles came To see a rival and a friend, Prepare to censure, or commend, Here to absolve, and there object, As art with candour might direct. He sails, he lands, he comes, he rings, His servants follow with the things: Appears the governante of th' house, For such in Greece were much in use;— If young or handsome, yea or no, Concerns not me, or thee, to know. Does 'Squire Protogenes live here? Yes, Sir, says she, with gracious air, And curtsey low; but just call'd out By lords peculiarly devout; Who came on purpose, Sir, to borrow Our Venus, for the feast to-morrow, To grace the church: 'tis Venus day: I hope, Sir, you intend to stay To see our Venus: 'tis the piece The most renown'd throughout all Greece, So like th' original, they say; But I have no great skill that way. But, Sir, at six ('tis now past three) Dromo must take my Master's tea. At six, Sir, if you please to come, You'll find my Master, Sir, at home. Tea, says a Critic, big with laughter, Was found some twenty ages after: Authors, before they write, should read. 'Tis very true;—but we'll proceed. And, Sir, at present, would you please To leave your name?—Fair maiden, yes. Reach me that board. No sooner spoke But done. With one judicious stroke, O'er the plain ground Apelles drew A circle regularly true. Prior. Apelles delicately drew A line retiring from the view, And quick as sportsmen draw their trigger, Produc'd a fine fore-shorten'd figure. And will you please, sweetheart, said he, To show your Master this from me? By it he presently will know, How Painters write their names at Co. He gave the pannel to the maid. Smiling and curt'sing, Sir, she said, I shall not fail to tell my Master: And, Sir, for fear of all disaster, I'll keep it my own self:—safe bind, Says the old proverb, and safe find. So, Sir, as sure as key or lock— Your servant, Sir—at six o'clock. Again at six Apelles came; Found the same prating civil dame. Sir, that my Master has been here, Will by the board itself appear. 'Tis thus he order'd me to say.P. If in the sketch you chose to draw, He found, you'll pardon me, a flaw— And tried to make a nicer line, You must not think the fault was mine; For he, strange man! will have his way. (I'm sure I find it night and day) And when 'twas done, he bade me say, Thus write the Painters of this Isle: Let those of Co remark the style. She said; and to his hand restor'd The rival pledge, the missive board. Or Leda's egg, or Cloe's breast.P. Apelles saw a truer stroke, Now here, now there, his own had broke; This gave the Artist a new hint, With pencil of a different tint, To trace, o'er both the lines together, A third, more elegant than either. And by its subtle intersection, He brought the drawing to perfection. The Coan now review'd the piece; And live, said he, the Arts of Greece! Howe'er Protogenes and I May in our rival talents vie; Howe'er our works may have express'd Who truest drew, or coloured best— When he beheld my flowing line, He found at least I could design, And from his artful round I grant That he with perfect skill can paint. Apelles view'd the finish'd piece. P. But now I've made it quite complete; I trust 'twill cause us soon too meet. It did. Protogenes beheld The Sketch, and own'd himself excell'd. Then to the port he ran in haste And clasp'd with friendly arms his guest. The dullest genius cannot fail To find the moral of my tale; That the distinguish'd part of men, With compass, pencil, sword, or pen, Should in life's visit leave their name In characters, which may proclaim, That they with ardour strove to raise At once their arts, and country's praise, That all was full, and round, and fair.P. And free from envy, spleen, and spite, Took each their patriotic flight; Like the two worthies of my story, On mutual plumes, to mutual glory. ODE OF CASIMIR TRANSLATED. Sweet harp, of well-fram'd box the vocal child! Here shalt thou hang on this tall poplar's spray, While ether smiles, and breezes mild Amid its pendant foliage play. Eurus shall here, but borne on softest wing, Whisper and pant thy warbling chords among, While pleas'd my careless limbs I fling On this green bank, and mark thy song— But lo! what sudden clouds veil the blue skies! What rushing sound of rain! Rise we with speed— Ah always thus, ye light-wing'd joys, Ye fly, and ere possess'd are fled! SONG OF HAROLD THE VALIANT. The original of this song is preserved in an old Icelandic Chronicle, called Knytlinga Saga. It was translated by Bartholinus into Latin, and from him into French by M. Mallet in his Introduction al' Histoire de Dannemarc. Vol. II. page 287 of the Northern Antiquities, taken from the above work, gives it in English prose under the title of an Ode of Harold the Valiant. He was a Norwegian Prince in the middle of the eleventh century. See also five pieces of Runic poetry published by Dr. Percy. It was versified with a view of being inserted in an Introduction to a projected Edition of an History of English Poetry (see Memoirs of Gray, last Edit. Vol. IV. p. 143) and was meant so be a specimen of the first Ballad (properly so called) now extant of northern origin. I My ships to far Sicilia's coast Have row'd their rapid way, While in their van my well-man'd barque Spread wide her streamers gay. Arm'd on the poop, myself a host, I seem'd in glory's orb to move— Ah, Harold! check the empty boast, A Russian maiden scorns thy love. II To fight the foe in early youth, I march'd to Drontheim's field; Numbers were theirs, but valour ours, Which forc'd that foe to yield. This right hand made their king a ghost: His youthful blood now stains the grove— Ah, Harold! check the empty boast, A Russian maiden scorns thy love. III Rough was the sea, and rude the wind, And scanty were my crew; Billows on billows o'er our deck With frothy fury flew: Deep in our hold the waves were tost, Back to their bed each wave we drove— Ah, Harold! check the empty boast, A Russian maiden scorns thy love. IV What feat of hardihood so bold But Harold wots it well? I curb the steed, I stem the flood, I fight with falchion fell; The oar I ply from coast to coast, On ice with flying skates I rove— Ah, Harold! check the empty boast, A Russian maiden scorns thy love. V Can she deny, the blooming maid, For she has heard the tale, When to the South my troops I led, The fortress to assail? How, while my prowess thinn'd the host, Fame bade the world each deed approve— Ah, Harold! check the empty boast, A Russian maiden scorns thy love. VI On Norway's cloud-cap'd mountains bred, Whose sons are bow-men brave, I dar'd, a deed that peasants dread, To plough old Ocean's wave; By tempest driven, by dangers crost, Through wild, unpeopl'd climes to rove— Ah, Harold! check the empty boast, A Russian maiden scorns thy love. SONG. I When first I dar'd by soft surprise To breathe my love in Flavia's ear, I saw the mixt sensations rise Of trembling joy and pleasing fear; Her cheek forgot its rosy hue, For what has Art with Love to do? II But soon the crimson glow return'd Ere half my passion was exprest, The eye that clos'd, the cheek that burn'd, The quiv'ring lip, the panting breast Shew'd that she wish'd or thought me true, For what has Art with Love to do? III Ah! speak, I cry'd, thy soft assent: She strove to speak, she could but sigh; A glance, more heav'nly eloquent, Left language nothing to supply. She prest my hand with fervour new; For what has Art with Love to do? IV Ye practis'd nymphs, who form your charms By Fashion's rules, enjoy your skill; Torment your swains with false alarms, And, ere you cure, pretend to kill: Still, still your sex's wiles pursue, Such tricks she leaves to Art and You. V Secure of native powers to please, My Flavia scorns all mean pretence; Her form is elegance and ease, Her soul is truth and innocence; And these, O heartfelt extasy! She gives to Honour, Love, and Me. July 11, 1765. THE ENGLISH GARDEN: A POEM. IN FOUR BOOKS. A Garden is the purest of human pleasures; it is the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man, without which buildings and palaces are but gross handiworks. And a man shall ever see, that when ages grow to civility and elegancy, men come to build stately, sooner than to garden finely: as if gardening were the greater perfection. Verulam. BOOK THE FIRST. To thee, divine Simplicity! to thee, Best arbitress of what is good and fair, This verse belongs. O, as it freely flows, Give it thy powers of pleasing: else in vain It strives to teach the rules, from Nature drawn, Of import high to those whose taste would add To Nature's careless graces; loveliest then, When, o'er her form, thy easy skill has taught The robe of Spring in ampler folds to flow. Haste, Goddess! to the woods, the lawns, the vales; That lie in rude luxuriance, and but wait Thy call to bloom with beauty. I meanwhile, Attendant on thy state serene, will mark Its faery progress; wake th' accordant string; And tell how far, beyond the transient glare Of fickle fashion, or of formal art, Thy flowery works with charm perennial please. Ye too, ye sister Powers! that, at my birth, Auspicious smil'd; and o'er my cradle dropp'd Those magic seeds of fancy, which produce A Poet's feeling, and a Painter's eye, Come to your votary's aid. For well ye know How soon my infant accents lisp'd the rhyme, How soon my hands the mimic colours spread, And vainly strove to snatch a double wreath From Fame's unfading laurel: fruitless aim; Yet not inglorious; nor perchance devoid Of friendly use to this fair argument; If so, with lenient smiles, ye deign to cheer, At this sad hour, my desolated soul. For deem not ye that I resume the strain To court the world's applause: my years mature Have learn'd to slight the toy. No, 'tis to sooth That agony of heart, which they alone, Who best have lov'd, who best have been belov'd, Can feel, or pity; sympathy severe! Which she too felt, when on her pallid lip The last farewell hung trembling, and bespoke A wish to linger here, and bless the arms She left for heav'n. She died, and heav'n is hers! Be mine, the pensive solitary balm That recollection yields. Yes, Angel pure! While Memory holds a seat, thy image still Shall reign, shall triumph there; and when, as now, Imagination forms a nymph divine To lead the fluent strain, thy modest blush, Thy mild demeanour, thy unpractis'd smile Shall grace that Nymph, and sweet Simplicity Be dress'd (ah meek Maria!) in thy charms. Begin the Song! and ye of Albion's sons Attend; ye freeborn, ye ingenuous few, Who heirs of competence, if not of wealth, Preserve that vestal purity of soul Whence genuine taste proceeds. To you, blest youths, I sing; whether in academic groves Studious ye rove; or, fraught with learning's stores, Visit the Latian plain, fond to transplant Those arts which Greece did, with her liberty, Resign to Rome. Yet know, the art I sing Ev'n there ye shall not learn. Rome knew it not While Rome was free: Ah! hope not then to find In slavish superstitious Rome the fair Remains. Meanwhile, of old and classic aid Though fruitless be the search, your eyes entranc'd Shall catch those glowing scenes, that taught a Claude To grace his canvass with Hesperian hues: And scenes like these, on Memory's tablet drawn, Bring back to Britain; there give local form To each idea; and, if Nature lend Materials fit of torrent, rock, and shade, Produce new Tivolis. But learn to rein, O youth! whose skill essays the arduous task, That skill within the limit she allows. Great Nature scorns control: she will not bear One beauty foreign to the spot or soil She gives thee to adorn: 'tis thine alone To mend, not change her features. Does her hand Stretch forth a level lawn? Ah, hope not thou To lift the mountain there. Do mountains frown Around? Ah, wish not there the level lawn. Yet she permits thy art, discreetly us'd, To smooth the rugged and to swell the plain. But dare with caution; else expect, bold man! The injur'd Genius of the place to rise In self-defence, and, like some giant fiend That frowns in Gothic story, swift destroy, By night, the puny labours of thy day. What then must he attempt, whom niggard Fate Has fixt in such an inauspicious spot As bears no trace of beauty? Must he sit Dull and inactive in the desert waste, If Nature there no happy feature wears To wake and meet his skill? Believe the Muse, She does not know that inauspicious spot Where Beauty is thus niggard of her store: Believe the Muse, through this terrestrial vast The seeds of grace are sown, profusely sown, Ev'n where we least may hope: the desert hills Will hear the call of Art; the vallies dank Obey her just behests, and smile with charms Congenial to the soil, and all its own. For tell me, where's the desert? There alone Where man resides not; or, if chance resides, He is not there the man his Maker form'd, Industrious man, by heav'ns first law ordain'd To earn his food by labour. In the waste Place thou that man with his primæval arms, His plough-share, and his spade; nor shalt thou long Impatient wait a change; the waste shall smile With yellow harvests; what was barren heath Shall soon be verdant mead. Now let thy art Exert its powers, and give, by varying lines, The soil, already tam'd, its finish'd grace. Nor less obsequious to the hand of toil, If Fancy guide that hand, will the dank vale Receive improvement meet; but Fancy here Must lead, not follow Labour; she must tell In what peculiar place the soil shall rise, Where sink; prescribe what form each sluice shall wear, And how direct its course; whether to spread Broad as a lake, or, as a river pent By fringed banks, weave its irriguous way Through lawn and shade alternate: for if she Preside not o'er the task, the narrow drains Will run in tedious parallel, or cut Each other in sharp angles; hence implore Her swift assistance, ere the ruthless spade Too deeply wound the bosom of the soil. Yet, in this lowly site, where all that charms Within itself must charm, hard is the task Impos'd on Fancy. Hence with idle fear! Is she not Fancy? and can Fancy fail In sweet delusions, in concealments apt, And wild creative power? She cannot fail. And yet, full oft, when her creative power, Her apt concealments, her delusions sweet Have been profusely lavish'd; when her groves Have shot, with vegetative vigour strong, Ev'n to their wish'd maturity; when Jove Has roll'd the changeful seasons o'er her lawns, And each has left a blessing as it roll'd: Ev'n then, perchance, some vain fastidious eye Shall rove unmindful of surrounding charms And ask for prospect. Stranger! 'tis not here. Go seek it on some garish turret's height; Seek it on Richmond's, or on Windsor's brow; There gazing, on the gorgeous vale below, Applaud alike, with fashion'd pomp of phrase, The good and bad, which, in profusion, there That gorgeous vale exhibits. Here meanwhile Ev'n in the dull, unseen, unseeing dell Thy taste contemns, shall Contemplation imp Her eagle plumes; the Poet here shall hold Sweet converse with his Muse; the curious Sage, Who comments on great Nature's ample tome, Shall find that volume here. For here are caves, Where rise those gurgling rills, that sing the song Which Contemplation loves; here shadowy glades, Where through the tremulous foliage darts the ray, That gilds the Poet's day-dream; here the turf Teems with the vegetating race; the air Is peopled with the insect tribes, that float Upon the noontide beam, and call the Sage To number and to name them. Nor if here The Painter comes, shall his enchanting art Go back without a boon: for Fancy here, With Nature's living colours, forms a scene Which Ruisdale best might rival: crystal lakes, O'er which the giant oak, himself a grove, Flings his romantic branches, and beholds His reverend image in th' expanse below. If distant hills be wanting, yet our eye Forgets the want, and with delighted gaze Rests on the lovely fore-ground; there applauds The art, which, varying forms and blending hues, Gives that harmonious force of shade and light, Which makes the landscape perfect. Art like this Is only art, all else abortive toil. Come then, thou sister Muse, from whom the mind Wins for her airy visions colour, form, And fixt locality, sweet Painting, come To teach the docile pupil of my song, How much his practice on thy aid depends. Of Nature's various scenes the Painter culls That for his fav'rite theme, where the fair whole Is broken into ample parts, and bold; Where to the eye three well-mark'd distances Spread their peculiar colouring. Vivid green, Warm brown, and black opake the fore-ground bears Conspicuous; sober olive coldly marks The second distance; thence the third declines In softer blue, or, less'ning still, is lost In faintest purple. When thy taste is call'd To deck a scene where Nature's self presents All these distinct gradations, then rejoice As does the Painter, and like him apply Thy colours; plant thou on each separate part Its proper foliage. Chief, for there thy skill Has its chief scope, enrich with all the hues That flowers, that shrubs, that trees can yield, the sides Of that fair path, from whence our sight is led Gradual to view the whole. Where'er thou wind'st That path, take heed between the scene and eye, To vary and to mix thy chosen greens. Here for a while with cedar or with larch, That from the ground spread their close texture, hide The view entire. Then o'er some lowly tuft, Where rose and woodbine bloom, permits its charms To burst upon the sight; now through a copse Of beech, that rear their smooth and stately trunks, Admit it partially, and half exclude, And half reveal its graces: in this path How long soe'er the wanderer roves, each step Shall wake fresh beauties; each short point present A different picture, new, and yet the same. Yet some there are who scorn this cautious rule, And fell each tree that intercepts the scene. O great Poussin! O Nature's darling, Claude! What if some rash and sacrilegious hand Tore from your canvass those umbrageous pines That frown in front, and give each azure hill The charm of contrast! Nature suffers here Like outrage, and bewails a beauty lost, Which Time, with tardy hand, shall late restore. Yet here the spoiler rests not; see him rise Warm from his devastation, to improve, For so he calls it, yonder champian wide. There on each bolder brow in shapes acute His fence he scatters; there the Scottish fir In murky file lifts his inglorious head, And blots the fair horizon. So should art Improve thy pencil's savage dignity, Salvator! if where, far as eye can pierce, Rock pil'd on rock, thy Alpine heights retire, She flung her random foliage, and disturb'd The deep repose of the majestic scene. This deed were impious. Ah, forgive the thought, Thou more than Painter, more than Poet! He, Alone thy equal, who was “Fancy's child.” Does then the Song forbid the Planter's hand To clothe the distant hills, and veil with woods Their barren summits? No; it but forbids All poverty of clothing. Rich the robe, And ample let it flow, that Nature wears On her thron'd eminence: where'er she takes Her horizontal march, pursue her step With sweeping train of forest; hill to hill Unite with prodigality of shade. There plant thy elm, thy chesnut; nourish there Those sapling oaks, which, at Britannia's call, May heave their trunks mature into the main, And float the bulwarks of her liberty: But if the fir, give it its station meet; Place it an outgard to the assailing north To shield the infant scions, till possest Of native strength, they learn alike to scorn The blast and their protectors. Foster'd thus, The cradled hero gains from female care His future vigour; but, that vigour felt, He springs indignant from his nurse's arms, Nods his terrific helmet, shakes his spear, And is that awful thing which heav'n ordain'd The scourge of tyrants, and his country's pride. If yet thy art be dubious how to treat Nature's neglected features, turn thy eye To those, the masters of correct design, Who, from her vast variety, have cull'd The loveliest, boldest parts, and new arrang'd; Yet, as herself approv'd, herself inspir'd. In their immortal works thou ne'er shalt find Dull uniformity, contrivance quaint, Or labour'd littleness; but contrasts broad, And careless lines, whose undulating forms Play through the varied canvass: these transplant Again on Nature; take thy plastic spade, It is thy pencil; take thy seeds, thy plants, They are thy colours; and by these repay With interest every charm she lent thy art. Nor, while I thus to Imitation's realm Direct thy step, deem I direct thee wrong; Nor ask, why I forget great Nature's fount, And bring thee not the bright inspiring cup From her original spring? Yet, if thou ask'st, Thyself shalt give the answer. Tell me why Did Raphael steal, when his creative hand Imag'd the Seraphim, ideal grace And dignity supernal from that store Of Attic sculpture, which the ruthless Goth Spar'd in his headlong fury? Tell me this: And then confess that beauty best is taught By those, the favour'd few, whom heav'n has lent The power to seize, select, and reunite Her loveliest features; and of these to form One archetype complete of sovereign grace. Here Nature sees her fairest forms more fair; Owns them for hers, yet owns herself excell'd By what herself produc'd. Here Art and She Embrace; connubial Juno smiles benign, And from the warm embrace Perfection springs. Rouse then each latent energy of soul To clasp ideal beauty. Proteus-like, Think not the changeful Nymph will long elude Thy chase, or with reluctant coyness frown. Inspir'd by her thy happy art shall learn To melt in fluent curves whate'er is straight, Acute, or parallel. For, these unchang'd, Nature and she disdain the formal scene. 'Tis their demand, that ev'ry step of rule Be sever'd from their sight: they own no charm But those that fair Variety creates, Who ever loves to undulate and sport In many a winding train. With equal zeal She, careless Goddess, scorns the cube and cone, As does mechanic Order hold them dear: Hence springs their enmity; and he that hopes To reconcile the foes, as well might aim With hawk and dove to draw the Cyprian car. Such sentence past, where shall the Dryads fly That haunt yon antient vista? Pity, sure, Will spare the long cathedral isle of shade In which they sojourn; Taste were sacrilege, If, lifting there the axe, it dar'd invade Those spreading oaks that in fraternal files Have pair'd for centuries, and heard the strains Of Sidney's, nay, perchance, of Surry's reed. Yet must they fall, unless mechanic skill, To save her offspring, rouse at our command And, where we bid her move, with engine huge, Each ponderous trunk, the ponderous trunk there move. A work of difficulty and danger try'd, Nor oft successful found. But if it fails, Thy axe must do its office. Cruel task, Yet needful. Trust me, though I bid thee strike, Reluctantly I bid thee: for my soul Holds dear an antient oak, nothing more dear; It is an antient friend. Stay then thine hand; And try by saplings tall, discreetly plac'd Before, between, behind, in scatter'd groups, To break th' obdurate line. So may'st thou save A chosen few; and yet, alas, but few Of these, the old protectors of the plain. Yet shall these few give to thy opening lawn That shadowy pomp, which only they can give: For parted now, in patriarchal pride, Each tree becomes the father of a tribe; And, o'er the stripling foliage, rising round, Towers with parental dignity supreme. And yet, my Albion! in that fair domain, Which Ocean made thy dowry, when his love Tempestuous tore thee from reluctant Gaul, And bade thee be his Queeu, there still remains Full many a lovely unfrequented wild, Where change like this is needless; where no lines Of hedge-row, avenue, or of platform square Demand destruction. In thy fair domain, Yes, my lov'd Albion! many a glade is found, The haunt of wood-gods only; where if Art E'er dar'd to tread, 'twas with unsandal'd foot, Printless, as if the place were holy ground, And there are scenes, where, tho' she whilom trod, Let by the worst of guides, fell Tyranny, And ruthless Superstition, we now trace Her footsteps with delight; and pleas'd revere What once had rous'd our hatred. But to Time, Not her, the praise is due: his gradual touch Has moulder'd into beauty many a tower, Which, when it frown'd with all its battlements, Was only terrible; and many a fane Monastic, which, when deck'd with all its spires, Serv'd but to feed some pamper'd Abbot's pride, And awe th' unletter'd vulgar. Generous youth, Whoe'er thou art, that listen'st to my lay, And feel'st thy soul assent to what I sing, Happy art thou if thou can'st call thine own Such scenes as these: where Nature and where Time Have work'd congenial; where a scatter'd host Of antique oaks darken thy sidelong hills; While, rushing through their branches, rifted cliffs Dart their white heads, and glitter through the gloom. More happy still, if one superior rock Bear on its brow the shiver'd fragment huge Of some old Norman fortress; happier far, Ah, then most happy, if thy vale below Wash, with the crystal coolness of its rills, Some mould'ring abbey's ivy-vested wall. O how unlike the scene my fancy forms, Did Folly, heretofore, with Wealth conspire To plan that formal, dull, disjointed scene, Which once was call'd a Garden. Britain still Bears on her breast full many a hideous wound Given by the cruel pair, when, borrowing aid From geometric skill, they vainly strove By line, by plummet, and unfeeling sheers, To form with verdure what the builder form'd With stone. Egregious madness; yet pursu'd With pains unwearied, with expence unsumm'd, And science doating. Hence the sidelong walls Of shaven yew; the holly's prickly arms Trimm'd into high arcades; the tonsile box Wove, in mosaic mode of many a curl, Around the figur'd carpet of the lawn. Hence too deformities of harder cure: The terras mound uplifted; the long line Deep delv'd of flat canal; and all that toil, Misled by tasteless Fashion, could atchieve To mar fair Nature's lineaments divine. Long was the night of error, nor dispell'd By him that rose at learning's earliest dawn, Prophet of unborn Science. On thy realm, Philosophy! his sovereign lustre spread; Yet did he deign to light with casual glance The wilds of taste. Yes, sagest Verulam, 'Twas thine to banish from the royal groves Each childish vanity of crisped knot And sculptur'd foliage; to the lawn restore Its ample space, and bid it feast the sight With verdure pure, unbroken, unabridg'd: For verdure sooths the eye, as roseate sweets The smell, or music's melting strains the ear. So taught the Sage, taught a degenerate reign What in Eliza's golden day was taste. Not but the mode of that romantic age, The age of tourneys, triumphs, and quaint masques, Glar'd with fantastic pageantry, which dimm'd The sober eye of truth, and dazzled ev'n The Sage himself; witness his high-arch'd hedge, In pillar'd state by carpentry upborn, With colour'd mirrors deck'd, and prison'd birds. But when our step has pac'd his proud parterres, And reach'd the heath, then Nature glads our eye Sporting in all her lovely carelessness. There smiles in varied tufts the velvet rose, There flaunts the gadding woodbine, swells the ground In gentle hillocks, and around its sides Thro' blossom'd shades the secret pathway steals. Thus, with a Poet's power, the Sage's pen Pourtray'd that nicer negligence of scene, Which Taste approves. While he, delicious swain, Who tun'd his oaten pipe by Mulla's stream, Accordant touch'd the stops in Dorian mood: What time he 'gan to paint the fairy vale, Where stands the fane of Venus. Well I ween That then, if ever, Colin, thy fond hand Did steep its pencil in the well-fount clear Of true simplicity; and “call'd in Art “Only to second Nature, and supply “All that the Nymph forgot, or left forlorn.” Yet what avail'd the song? or what avail'd Ev'n thine, thou chief of Bards, whose mighty mind, With inward light irradiate, mirror-like Receiv'd, and to mankind with ray reflex The sov'reign Planter's primal work display'd? That work, where not nice Art in curious knots, “But Nature boon pour'd forth on hill and dale “Flowers worthy of Paradise; while all around “Umbrageous grotts, and caves of cool recess, “And murmuring waters down the slope dispers'd, “Or held, by fringed banks, in crystal lakes, “Compose a rural seat of various view.” 'Twas thus great Nature's herald blazon'd high That fair original impress, which she bore In state sublime; e'er miscreated Art, Offspring of Sin and Shame, the banner seiz'd, And with adulterate pageantry defil'd. Yet vainly, Milton, did thy voice proclaim These her primæval honours. Still she lay Defac'd, deflower'd, full many a ruthless year: Alike, when Charles, the abject tool of France, Came back to smile his subjects into slaves; Or Belgic William, with his warrior frown, Coldly declar'd them free; in fetters still The Goddess pin'd, by both alike opprest. Go to the proof! Behold what Temple call'd A perfect Garden. There thou shalt not find One blade of verdure, but with aching feet From terras down to terras shalt descend, Step following step, by tedious flight of stairs: On leaden platforms now the noon-day sun Shall scorch thee; now the dank arcades of stone Shall chill thy fervour; happy, if at length Thou reach the Orchard, where the sparing turf Through equal lines, all centring in a point, Yields thee a softer tread. And yet full oft O'er Temple's studious hour did Truth preside, Sprinkling her lustre o'er his classic page: There hear his candour own in fashion's spite, In spite of courtly dulness, hear it own “There is a grace in wild variety “Surpassing rule and order.” Temple, yes, There is a grace; and let eternal wreaths Adorn their brows who fixt its empire here. The Muse shall hail the champions that herself Led to the fair atchievement. Addison, Thou polish'd Sage, or shall I call thee Bard, I see thee come: around thy temples play The lambent flames of humour, bright'ning mild Thy judgment into smiles; gracious thou com'st With Satire at thy side, who checks her frown, But not her secret sting. With bolder rage Pope next advances: his indignant arm Waves the poetic brand o'er Timon's shades, And lights them to destruction; the fierce blaze Sweeps through each kindred vista; groves to groves Nod their fraternal farewell, and expire. And now, elate with fair-earn'd victory, The Bard retires, and on the bank of Thames Erects his flag of triumph; wild it waves In verdant splendor, and beholds, and hails The King of Rivers, as he rolls along. Kent is his bold associate; Kent, who felt The pencil's power: but, fir'd by higher forms Of beauty, than that pencil knew to paint, Work'd with the living hues that Nature lent, And realiz'd his landscapes. Generous He, Who gave to Painting, what the wayward Nymph Refus'd her votary, those Elysian scenes, Which would she emulate, her nicest hand Must all its force of light and shade employ. On thee too, Southcote, shall the Muse bestow No vulgar praise: for thou to humblest things Could'st give ennobling beauties; deck'd by thee, The simple farm eclips'd the garden's pride, Ev'n as the virgin blush of innocence, The harlotry of art. Nor, Shenstone, thou Shalt pass without thy meed, thou son of peace! Who knew'st, perchance, to harmonize thy shades Still softer than thy song; yet was that song Nor rude, nor inharmonious, when attun'd To pastoral plaint, or tale of slighted love. Him too, the living leader of thy powers, Great Nature! him the Muse shall hail in notes Which antedate the praise true genius claims From just posterity: Bards yet unborn Shall pay to Brown that tribute, fitliest paid In strains, the beauty of his scenes inspire. Meanwhile, ye youths! whose sympathetic souls Would taste those genuine charms, which faintly smile In my descriptive song, O visit oft The finish'd scenes, that boast the forming hand Of these creative Genii! feel ye there What Reynolds felt, when first the Vatican Unbarr'd her gates, and to his raptur'd eye Gave all the god-like energy that flow'd From Michael's pencil; feel what Garrick felt, When first he breath'd the soul of Shakspeare's page. So shall your Art, if call'd to grace a scene Yet unadorn'd, with taste instinctive give Each grace appropriate; so your active eye Shall dart that glance prophetic, which awakes The slumbering wood-nymphs; gladly shall they rise, Oread and Dryad, from their verdurous beds, And fling their foliage, and arrange their stems, As you, and beauty bid: the Naiad train, Alike obsequious, from a thousand urns Shall pour their crystalline tide; while hand in hand, Vertumnus and Pomona bring their stores, Fruitage, and flowers of ev'ry blush and scent, Each varied season yields; to you they bring The fragrant tribute; ye, with generous hand Diffuse the blessing wide, till Albion smile One ample theatre of sylvan grace. END OF THE FIRST BOOK. BOOK THE SECOND. Hail to the Art, that teaches Wealth and Pride How to possess their wish, the world's applause, Unmixt with blame! that bids Magnificence Abate its meteor glare, and learn to shine Benevolently mild; like her, the Queen Of Night, who sailing through autumnal skies, Gives to the bearded product of the plain Her ripening lustre, lingering as she rolls, And glancing cool the salutary ray Which fills the fields with plenty. Hail, that Art Ye swains! for, hark! with lowings glad, your herds Proclaim its influence, wandering o'er the lawns Restor'd to them and Nature; now no more Shall Fortune's minion rob them of their right, Or round his dull domain with lofty wall Oppose their jocund presence. Gothic Pomp Frowns and retires, his proud behests are scorn'd: Now Taste, inspir'd by Truth, exalts her voice, And she is heard. “Oh, let not man misdeem; “Waste is not Grandeur, Fashion ill supplies “My sacred place, and Beauty scorns to dwell “Where Use is exiled.” At the awful sound The terrace sinks spontaneous; on the green, Broider'd with crisped knots, the tonsile yews Wither and fall; the fountain dares no more To fling its wasted crystal through the sky, But pours salubrious o'er the parched lawn Rills of fertility. Oh best of Arts That works this happy change! true alchymy, Beyond the Rosicrusian boast, that turns Deformity to grace, expense to gain, And pleas'd restores to Earth's maternal lap The long-lost fruits of Amalthea's horn! When such the theme, the Poet smiles secure Of candid audience, and with touch assur'd Resumes his reed Ascræan; eager he To ply its warbling stops of various note In Nature's cause, that Albion's listening youths, Inform'd erewhile to scorn the long-drawn lines Of straight formality, alike may scorn Those quick, acute, perplex'd, and tangled paths, That, like the snake crush'd by the sharpen'd spade, Writhe in convulsive torture, and full oft, Through many a dark and unsunn'd labyrinth, Mislead our step; till giddy, spent, and foiled, We reach the point where first our race began. These Fancy priz'd erroneous, what time Taste, An infant yet, first join'd her to destroy The measur'd platform; into false extremes What marvel if they stray'd, as yet unskill'd To mark the form of that peculiar curve, Alike averse to crooked and to straight, Where sweet Simplicity resides; which Grace And Beauty call their own; whose lambent flow Charms us at once with symmetry and ease. 'Tis Nature's curve, instinctively she bids Her tribes of Being trace it. Down the slope Of yon wide field, see, with its gradual sweep The ploughing steers their fallow ridges swell; The peasant, driving through each shadowy lane His team, that bends beneath th' incumbent weight Of laughing Ceres, marks it with his wheel; At night, and morn, the milkmaid's careless step Has, through yon pasture green, from stile to stile, Imprest a kindred curve; the scudding hare Draws to her drew-sprent seat, o'er thymy heaths, A path as gently waving: mark them well; Compare, pronounce, that, varying but in size, Their forms are kindred all; go then, convinc'd That Art's unerring rule is only drawn From Nature's sacred source; a rule that guides Her ev'ry toil; or, if she shape the path, Or scoop the lawn, or gradual, lift the hill. For not alone to that embellish'd walk, Which leads to ev'ry beauty of the scene, It yields a grace, but spreads its influence wide, Prescribes each form of thicket, copse, or wood, Confines the rivulet, and spreads the lake. Yet shall this graceful line forget to please, If border'd close by sidelong parallels, Nor duly mixt with those opposing curves That give the charm of contrast. Vainly Taste Draws through the grove her path in easiest bend, If, on the margin of its woody sides, The measur'd greensward waves in kindred flow: Oft let the turf recede, and oft approach, With varied breadth, now sink into the shade, Now to the sun its verdant bosom bare. As vainly wilt thou lift the gradual hill To meet thy right-hand view, if to the left An equal hill ascends: in this, and all Be various, wild, and free as Nature's self. For in her wildness is there oft an art, Or seeming art, which, by position apt, Arranges shapes unequal, so to save That correspondent poise, which unpreserv'd Would mock our gaze with airy vacancy. Yet fair variety, with all her powers, Assists the balance: 'gainst the barren crag She lifts the pastur'd slope; to distant hills Opposes neighb'ring shades; and, central oft, Relieves the flatness of the lawn, or lake, With studded tuft, or island. So to poise Her objects, mimic Art may oft attain: She rules the foreground; she can swell or sink Its surface; here her leafy screen oppose, And there withdraw; here part the varying greens, And there in one promiscuous gloom combine As best befits the Genius of the scene. Him then, that sov'reign Genius, Monarch sole Who, from creation's primal day, derives His right divine to this his rural throne, Approach with meet obeisance; at his feet Let our aw'd art fall prostrate. They of Ind, The Tartar tyrants, Tamerlane's proud race, Or they in Persia thron'd, who shake the rod Of power o'er myriads of enervate slaves, Expect not humbler homage to their pride Than does this sylvan Despot. Yet to those Who do him loyal service, who revere His dignity, nor aim, with rebel arms, At lawless usurpation, is he found Patient and placable, receives well pleas'd Their tributary treasures, nor disdains To blend them with his own internal store. Stands he in blank and desolated state, Where yawning crags disjointed, sharp, uncouth, Involve him with pale horror? In the clefts Thy welcome spade shall heap that fost'ring mould Whence sapling oaks may spring; whence clust'ring crowds Of early underwood shall veil their sides, And teach their rugged heads above the shade To tower in shapes romantic: nor, around Their flinty roots, shall ivy spare to hang Its gadding tendrils, nor the moss-grown turf, With wild thyme sprinkled, there refuse to spread Its verdure. Awful still, yet not austere, The Genius stands; bold is his port, and wild, But not forlorn, nor savage. On some plain Of tedious length, say, are his flat limbs laid? Thy hand shall lift him from the dreary couch, Pillowing his head with swelling hillocks green, While, all around, a forest-curtain spreads Its waving folds, and blesses his repose. What, if perchance in some prolific soil, Where Vegetation strenuous, uncontrol'd, Has push'd her pow'rs luxuriant, he now pines For air and freedom? Soon thy sturdy axe, Amid its intertwisted foliage driv'n, Shall open all his glades, and ingress give To the bright darts of day; his prison'd rills, That darkling crept amid the rustling brakes, Shall glitter as they glide, and his dank caves, Free to salubrious Zephyrs, cease to weep. Meanwhile his shadowy pomp he still retains, His Dryads still attend him; they alone Of race plebeian banish'd, who to crowd, Not grace his state, their boughs obtrusive flung. But chief consult him ere thou dar'st decide Th' appropriate bounds of Pleasure, and of Use; For Pleasure, lawless robber, oft invades Her neighbour's right, and turns to idle waste Her treasures: curb her then in scanty bounds, Whene'er the scene permits that just retraint. The curb restrains not Beauty; sov'reign she Still triumphs, still unites each subject realm, And blesses both impartial. Why then fear Lest, if thy fence contract the shaven lawn, It does Her wrong? She points a thousand ways, And each her own, to cure the needful ill. Where'er it winds, and freely must it wind, She bids, at ev'ry bend, thick-blossom'd tufts Crowd their inwoven tendrils: is there still A void? Lo, Lebanon her cedar lends! Lo, all the stately progeny of pines Come, with their floating foliage richly deck'd, To fill that void! meanwhile across the mead The wand'ring flocks that browse between the shades Seem oft to pass their bounds; the dubious eye Decides not if they crop the mead or lawn. Browse then your fill, fond foresters! to you Shall sturdy Labour quit his morning task Well pleas'd; nor longer o'er his useless plots Draw through the dew the splendour of his scythe. He, leaning on that scythe, with carols gay Salutes his fleecy substitutes, that rush In bleating chase to their delicious task, And spreading o'er the plain, with eager teeth Devour it into verdure. Browse your fill Fond foresters! the soil that you enrich Shall still supply your morn and evening meal With choicest delicates; whether you choose The vernal blades, that rise with seeded stem Of hue purpureal; or the clover white, That in a spiked ball collects its sweets; Or trembling fescue: ev'ry fav'rite herb Shall court your taste, ye harmless epicures! Meanwhile permit that with unheeded step I pass beside you, nor let idle fear Spoil your repast, for know the lively scene, That you still more enliven, to my soul Darts inspiration, and impels the song To roll in bolder descant; while, within, A gleam of happiness primæval seems To snatch me back to joys my nature claim'd, Ere vice defil'd, ere slavery sunk the world, And all was faith and freedom: then was man Creation's king, yet friend; and all that browse, Or skim, or dive, the plain, the air, the flood, Paid him their liberal homage; paid unaw'd In love accepted, sympathetic love That felt for all, and blest them with its smiles. Then, nor the curling horn had learn'd to sound The savage song of chase; the barbed shaft Had then no poison'd point; nor thou, fell tube! Whose iron entrails hide the sulphurous blast, Satanic engine, knew'st the ruthless power Of thundering death around thee. Then alike Were ye innocuous through your ev'ry tribe, Or brute, or reptile; nor by rage or guile Had giv'n to injur'd man his only plea (And that the tyrant's plea) to work your harm. Instinct, alas! like wayward Reason, now Veers from its pole. There was a golden time When each created being kept its sphere Appointed, nor infring'd its neighbour's right. The flocks, to whom the grassy lawn was giv'n, Fed on its blades contented; now they crush Each scion's tender shoots, and, at its birth, Destroy, what, sav'd from their remorseless tooth, Had been the tree of Jove. Ev'n while I sing, Yon wanton lamb has cropt the woodbine's pride, That bent beneath a full-blown load of sweets, And fill'd the air with perfume; see it falls; The busy bees, with many a murmur sad, Hang o'er their honied loss. Why is it thus? Ah, why must Art defend the friendly shades She rear'd to shield you from the noontide beam? Traitors, forbear to wound them! say, ye fools! Does your rich herbage fail? do acrid leaves Afford you daintier food? I plead in vain; For now the father of the fleecy troop Begins his devastation, and his ewes Crowd to the spoil, with imitative zeal. Since then, constrain'd, we must expel the flock From where our saplings rise, our flow'rets bloom, The song shall teach, in clear preceptive notes, How best to frame the fence, and best to hide All its foreseen defects; defective still, Though hid with happiest art. Ingrateful sure When such the theme, becomes the Poet's task: Yet must he try, by modulation meet Of varied cadence, and selected phrase, Exact yet free, without inflation bold, To dignify that theme, must try to form Such magic sympathy of sense with sound As pictures all it sings; while Grace awakes At each blest touch, and, on the lowliest things, Scatters her rainbow hues. The first and best Is that, which, sinking from our eye, divides Yet seems not to divide the shaven lawn, And parts it from the pasture; for if there Sheep feed, or dappled deer, their wandering teeth Will, smoothly as the scythe, the herbage shave, And leave a kindred verdure. This to keep Heed that thy labourer scoop the trench with care; For some there are who give their spade repose, When broad enough the perpendicular sides Divide, and deep descend. To form perchance Some needful drain, such labour may suffice, Yet not for beauty: here thy range of wall Must lift its height erect, and, o'er its head A verdant veil of swelling turf expand, While smoothly from its base with gradual ease The pasture meets its level, at that point Which best deludes our eye, and best conceals Thy lawn's brief limit. Down so smooth a slope The fleecy foragers will gladly browse; The velvet herbage free from weeds obscene Shall spread its equal carpet, and the trench Be pasture to its base. Thus form thy fence Of stone, for stone alone, and pil'd on high, Best curbs the nimble deer, that love to range Unlimited; but where tame heifers feed, Or innocent sheep, an humbler mound will serve Unlin'd with stone, and but a greensward trench. Here midway down, upon the nearer bank Plant thy thick row of thorns, and, to defend Their infant shoots, beneath, on oaken stakes, Extend a rail of elm, securely arm'd With spiculated paling, in such sort As, round some citadel, the engineer Directs his sharp stoccade. But when the shoots Condense, and interweave their prickly boughs Impenetrable, then withdraw their guard, They've done their office; scorn thou to retain, What frowns like military art, in scenes, Where peace should smile perpetual. These destroy'd, Make it thy vernal care, when April calls New shoots to birth, to trim the hedge aslant, And mould it to the roundness of the mound, Itself a shelving hill; nor need we here The rule or line precise, a casual glance Suffices to direct the careless sheers. Yet learn, that each variety of ground Claims its peculiar barrier. When the foss Can steal transverse before the central eye, 'Tis duly drawn; but, up yon neighb'ring hill That fronts the lawn direct, if labour delve The yawning chasm, 'twill meet, not cross our view; No foliage can conceal, no curve correct The deep deformity. And yet thou mean'st Up yonder hill to wind thy fragrant way, And wisely dost thou mean; for its broad eye Catches the sudden charms of laughing vales, Rude rocks and headlong streams, and antique oaks Lost in a wild horizon; yet the path That leads to all these charms expects defence: Here then suspend the sportsman's hempen toils, And stretch their meshes on the light support Of hazel plants, or draw thy lines of wire In fivefold parallel; no danger then That sheep invade thy foliage. To thy herds, And pastur'd steeds an opener fence oppose, Form'd by a triple row of cordage strong, Tight drawn the stakes between. The simple deer Is curb'd by mimic snares; the slenderest twine (If sages err not) that the beldame spins When by her wintry lamp she plies her wheel, Arrests his courage; his impetuous hoof, Broad chest, and branching antlers nought avail; In fearful gaze he stands; the nerves that bore His bounding pride o'er lofty mounds of stone, A single thread defies. Such force has fear, When visionary fancy wakes the fiend, In brute, or man, most powerful when most vain. Still must the swain, who spreads these corded guards, Expect their swift decay. The noontide beams Relax, the nightly dews contract the twist. Oft too the coward hare, then only bold When mischief prompts, or wintry famine pines, Will quit her rush-grown form, and steal, with ear Up-prick'd, to gnaw the toils; and oft the ram And jutting steer drive their entangling horns Through the frail meshes, and, by many a chasm, Proclaim their hate of thraldom. Nothing brooks Confinement, save degenerate man alone, Who deems a monarch's smile can gild his chains. Tir'd then, perchance, of nets that daily claim Thy renovating labour, thou wilt form, With elm and oak, a rustic balustrade Of firmest juncture: happy could thy toil Make it as fair as firm; yet vain the wish, Aim but to hide, not grace its formal line. Let those, who weekly, from the city's smoke, Crowd to each neighb'ring hamlet, there to hold Their dusty Sabbath, tip with gold and red The milk-white palisades, that Gothic now, And now Chinese, now neither, and yet both, Checquer their trim domain. Thy sylvan scene Would fade, indignant at the tawdry glare. 'Tis thine alone to seek what shadowy hues Tinging thy fence may lose it in the lawn; And these to give thee Painting must descend Ev'n to her meanest office; grind, compound, Compare, and by the distanced eye decide. For this she first, with snowy ceruse, joins The ochr'ous atoms that chalybeate rills Wash from their mineral channels, as they glide, In flakes of earthy gold; with these unites A tinge of blue, or that deep azure gray, Form'd from the calcin'd fibres of the vine; And, if she blends, with sparing hand she blends That base metallic drug then only priz'd, When, aided by the humid touch of Time, It gives a Nero's or some tyrant's cheek, Its precious canker. These with fluent oil Attemper'd, on thy length'ning rail shall spread That sober olive-green which Nature wears Ev'n on her vernal bosom; nor misdeem, For that, illumin'd with the noontide ray, She boasts a brighter garment, therefore Art A livelier verdure to thy aid should bring. Know when that Art, with ev'ry varied hue, Portrays the living landscape; when her hand Commands the canvass plane to glide with streams, To wave with foliage, or with flowers to breathe, Cool olive tints, in soft gradation laid, Create the general herbage: there alone, Where darts with vivid force, the ray supreme Unsullied verdure reigns; and tells our eye It stole its bright reflection from the sun. The paint is spread; the barrier pales retire, Snatch'd, as by magic, from the gazer's view. So, when the sable ensign of the night, Unfurl'd by mist-impelling Eurus, veils The last red radiance of declining day, Each scatter'd village, and each holy spire That deck'd the distance of the sylvan scene, Are sunk in sudden gloom: the plodding hind, That homeward hies, kens not the cheering site Of his calm cabin, which, a moment past, Stream'd from its roof an azure curl of smoke, Beneath the sheltering coppice, and gave sign Of warm domestic welcome from his toil. Nor is that cot, of which fond Fancy draws This casual picture, alien from our theme. Revisit it at morn; its opening latch, Though Penury and Toil within reside, Shall pour thee forth a youthful progeny Glowing with health and beauty (such the dower Of equal heav'n): See how the ruddy tribe Throng round the threshold, and, with vacant gaze, Salute thee; call the loiterers into use, And form of these thy fence, the living fence That graces what it guards. Thou think'st, perchance, That, skill'd in Nature's heraldry, thy art Has, in the limits of yon fragrant tuft, Marshall'd each rose, that to the eye of June Spreads its peculiar crimson; do not err, The loveliest still is wanting; the fresh rose Of Innocence, it blossoms on their cheek, And, lo, to thee they bear it! striving all, In panting race, who first shall reach the lawn, Proud to be call'd thy shepherds. Want, alas! Has o'er their little limbs her livery hung, In many a tatter'd fold, yet still those limbs Are shapely; their rude locks start from their brow, Yet, on that open brow, its dearest throne, Sits sweet Simplicity. Ah, clothe the troop In such a russet garb as best befits Their pastoral office; let the leathern scrip Swing at their side, tip thou their crook with steel, And braid their hat with rushes, then to each Assign his station; at the close of eve, Be it their care to pen in hurdled cote The flock, and when the matin prime returns, Their care to set them free; yet watching still The liberty they lend, oft shalt thou hear Their whistle shrill, and oft their faithful dog Shall with obedient barkings fright the flock From wrong or robbery. The livelong day Meantime rolls lightly o'er their happy heads; They bask on sunny hillocks, or desport In rustic pastime, while that loveliest grace, Which only lives in action unrestrain'd, To ev'ry simple gesture lends a charm. Pride of the year, purpureal Spring! attend, And, in the cheek of these sweet innocents Behold your beauties pictur'd. As the cloud That weeps its moment from thy sapphire heav'n, They frown with causeless sorrow; as the beam, Gilding that cloud, with causeless mirth they smile. Stay, pitying Time! prolong their vernal bliss. Alas! ere we can note it in our song, Comes manhood's feverish summer, chill'd full soon By cold autumnal care, till wint'ry age Sinks in the frore severity of death. Ah! who, when such life's momentary dream, Would mix in hireling senates, strenuous there To crush the venal hydra, whose fell crests Rise with recruited venom from the wound! Who, for so vain a conflict, would forego Thy sylvan haunts, celestial Solitude! Where self-improvement, crown'd with self-content, Await to bless thy votary? Nurtur'd thus In tranquil groves, list'ning to Nature's voice, That preach'd from whispering trees, and babbling brooks, A lesson seldom learnt in Reason's school, The wise Sidonian liv'd: and, though the pest Of lawless tyranny around him rag'd; Though Strato, great alone in Persia's gold, Uncall'd, unhallow'd by the people's choice, Usurp'd the throne of his brave ancestors, Yet was his soul all peace; a garden's care His only thought, its charms his only pride. But now the conquering arms of Macedon Had humbled Persia. Now Phænicia's realm Receives the Son of Ammon; at whose frown Her tributary kings or quit their thrones, Or at his smile retain; and Sidon, now Freed from her tyrant, points the victor's step To where her rightful sov'reign, doubly dear By birth and virtue, prun'd his garden grove. 'Twas at that early hour, when now the sun Behind majestic Lebanon's dark veil Hid his ascending splendor; yet through each Her cedar-vested sides, his flaunting beams Shot to the strand, and purpled all the main, Where Commerce saw her Sidon's freighted wealth, With languid streamers, and with folded sails, Float in a lake of gold. The wind was hush'd; And, to the beach, each slowly-lifted wave, Creeping with silver curl, just kist the shore, And slept in silence. At this tranquil hour Did Sidon's senate, and the Grecian host, Led by the conqueror of the world, approach The secret glade that veil'd the man of toil. Now near the mountain's foot the chief arriv'd, Where, round that glade, a pointed aloe screen, Entwin'd with myrtle, met in tangled brakes, That barr'd all entrance, save at one low gate, Whose time-disjointed arch, with ivy chain'd, Bad stoop the warrior train. A pathway brown Led through the pass, meeting a fretful brook, And wandering near its channel, while it leapt O'er many a rocky fragment, where rude Art Had eas'd perchance, but not prescrib'd its way. Close was the vale and shady; yet ere long Its forest sides retiring, left a lawn Of ample circuit, where the widening stream Now o'er its pebbled channel nimbly tript In many a lucid maze. From the flower'd verge Of this clear rill now stray'd the devious path, Amid ambrosial tufts where spicy plants, Weeping their perfum'd tears of myrrh, and nard, Stood crown'd with Sharon's rose; or where, apart, The patriarch palm his load of sugar'd dates Shower'd plenteous; where the fig, of standard strength, And rich pomegranate, wrapt in dulcet pulp Their racy seeds; or where the citron's bough Bent with its load of golden fruit mature. Meanwhile the lawn beneath the scatter'd shade Spread its serene extent; a stately file Of circling cypress mark'd the distant bound. Now, to the left, the path ascending pierc'd A smaller sylvan theatre, yet deck'd With more majestic foliage. Cedars here, Coeval with the sky-crown'd mountain's self, Spread wide their giant arms; whence, from a rock Craggy and black, that seem'd its fountain head, The stream fell headlong; yet still higher rose, Ev'n in th' eternal snows of Lebanon, That hallow'd spring; thence, in the porous earth Long while ingulph'd, its crystal weight here forc'd Its way to light and freedom. Down it dash'd; A bed of native marble pure receiv'd The new-born Naiad, and repos'd her wave, Till with o'erflowing pride it skimm'd the lawn. Fronting this lake there rose a solemn grot, O'er which an ancient vine luxuriant flung Its purple clusters, and beneath its roof An unhewn altar. Rich Sabæan gums That altar pil'd; and there with torch of pine The venerable Sage, now first descry'd, The fragrant incense kindled. Age had shed That dust of silver o'er his sable locks, Which spoke his strength mature beyond its prime, Yet vigorous still, for from his healthy cheek Time had not cropt a rose, or on his brow One wrinkling furrow plough'd; his eagle eye Had all its youthful lightning, and each limb The sinewy strength that toil demands, and gives. The warrior saw, and paus'd: his nod withheld The crowd at awful distance, where their ears, In mute attention, drank the Sage's prayer. “Parent of Good (he cried) behold the gifts “Thy humble votary brings, and may thy smile “Hallow his custom'd offering. Let the hand “That deals in blood, with blood thy shrines distain; “Be mine this harmless tribute. If it speaks “A grateful heart, can hecatombs do more? “Parent of Good! they cannot. Purple Pomp “May call thy presence to a prouder fane “Than this poor cave; but will thy presence there “Be more devoutly felt? Parent of Good! “It will not. Here then, shall the prostrate heart, “That deeply feels thy presence, lift its pray'r. “But what has he to ask who nothing needs, “Save what, unask'd, is from thy heav'n of heav'ns “Giv'n in diurnal good? yet, holy Power! “Do all that call thee Father thus exult “In thy propitious presence? Sidon sinks “Beneath a tyrant's scourge. Parent of Good! “Oh free my captive country.”—Sudden here He paus'd and sigh'd. And now, the raptur'd crowd Murmur applause: he heard, he turn'd, and saw The King of Macedon with eager step Burst from his warrior phalanx. From the youth, Who bore its state, the conqueror's own right hand Snatch'd the rich wreath, and bound it on his brow. His swift attendants o'er his shoulders cast The robe of empire, while the trumpet's voice Proclaim'd him King of Sidon. Stern he stood, Or, if he smil'd, 'twas a contemptuous smile, That held the pageant honours in disdain. Then burst the people's voice, in loud acclaim, And bade him be their Father. At the word, The honour'd blood, that warm'd him, flush'd his cheek; His brow expanded; his exalted step March'd firmer; graciously he bow'd the head, And was the Sire they call'd him. “Tell me, King,” Young Ammon cry'd, while o'er his bright'ning form He cast the gaze of wonder, “how a soul “Like thine could bear the toils of Penury?” “Oh grant me, Gods!” he answer'd, “so to bear “This load of Royalty. My toil was crown'd “With blessings lost to kings; yet, righteous Powers! “If to my country ye transfer the boon, “I triumph in the loss. Be mine the chains “That fetter sov'reignty; let Sidon smile “With, your best blessings, Liberty and Peace.” END OF THE SECOND BOOK. BOOK THE THIRD. Clos'd is that curious ear, by Death's cold hand, That mark'd each error of my careless strain With kind severity; to whom my Muse Still lov'd to whisper, what she meant to sing In louder accent; to whose taste supreme She first and last appeal'd, nor wish'd for praise, Save when his smile was herald to her fame. Yes, thou art gone; yet Friendship's fault'ring tongue Invokes thee still; and still, by Fancy sooth'd, Fain would she hope her Gray attends the call. Why then, alas! in this my fav'rite haunt Place I the urn, the bust, the sculptur'd lyre, Or fix this votive tablet, fair inscrib'd With numbers worthy thee, for they are thine? Why, if thou hear'st me still, these symbols sad Of fond memorial? Ah! my pensive soul! He hears me not, nor ever more shall hear The theme his candour, not his taste approv'd. Oft, ‘smiling as in scorn,’ oft would he cry, “Why waste thy numbers on a trivial art, “That ill can mimic even the humblest charms “Of all-majestic Nature?” at the word His eye would glisten, and his accents glow With all the Poet's frenzy, “Sov'reign Queen! “Behold, and tremble, while thou view'st her state “Thron'd on the heights of Skiddaw: call thy art “To build her such a throne; that art will feel “How vain her best pretensions. Trace her march “Amid the purple craggs of Borrowdale; “And try like those to pile thy range of rock “In rude tumultuous chaos. See! she mounts “Her Naiad car, and, down Lodore's dread cliff “Falls many a fathom, like the headlong Bard “My fabling fancy plung'd in Conway's flood; “Yet not like him to sink in endless night: “For, on its boiling bosom, still she guides “Her buoyant shell, and leads the wave along; “Or spreads it broad, a river, or a lake, “As suits her pleasure; will thy boldest song “E'er brace the sinews of enervate art “To such dread daring? Will it ev'n direct “Her hand to emulate those softer charms “That deck the banks of Dove, or call to birth “The bare romantic craggs, and copses green, “That sidelong grace her circuit, whence the rills, “Bright in their crystal purity, descend “To meet their sparkling Queen? around each fount “The hawthorns crowd, and knit their blossom'd sprays “To keep their sources sacred. Here, even here, “Thy art, each active sinew stretch'd in vain, “Would perish in its pride. Far rather thou “Confess her scanty power, correct, controul, “Tell her how far, nor farther, she may go; “And rein with Reason's curb fantastic Taste.” Yes, I will hear thee, dear lamented Shade, And hold each dictate sacred. What remains Unsung shall so each leading rule select As if still guided by thy judment sage; While, as still modell'd to thy curious ear, Flow my melodious numbers; so shall praise, If ought of praise the verse I weave may claim, From just posterity reward my song. Erewhile to trace the path, to form the fence, To mark the destin'd limits of the lawn, The Muse, with measur'd step, preceptive, pac'd. Now from the surface with impatient flight She mounts, Sylvanus! o'er thy world of shade To spread her pinions. Open all thy glades, Greet her from all thy echoes. Orpheus-like, Arm'd with the spells of harmony she comes, To lead thy forests forth to lovelier haunts, Where Fancy waits to fix them; from the dell Where now they lurk she calls them to possess Conspicuous stations; to their varied forms Allots congenial place; selects, divides, And blends anew in one Elysian scene. Yet, while I thus exult, my weak tongue feels Its ineffectual powers, and seeks in vain That force of ancient phrase which, speaking, paints, And is the thing it sings. Ah Virgil! why, By thee neglected, was this loveliest theme Left to the grating voice of modern reed? Why not array it in the splendid robe Of thy rich diction, and consign the charge To Fame thy handmaid, whose immortal plume Had born its praise beyond the bounds of Time? Countless is Vegetation's verdant brood As are the stars that stud yon cope of heaven; To marshal all her tribes in order'd file, Generic, or specific, might demand His science, wond'rous Swede! whose ample mind, Like ancient Tadmor's philosophic king, Stretch'd from the hyssop creeping on the wall To Lebanon's proudest cedars. Skill like this, Which spans a third of Nature's copious realm, Our art requires not, sedulous alone To note those general properties of form, Dimension, growth, duration, strength, and hue, Then first imprest, when, at the dawn of time, The form-deciding, life-inspiring word Pronounc'd them into being. These prime marks Distinctive, docile Memory makes her own, That each its shadowy succour may supply To her wish'd purpose; first, with needful shade, To veil whate'er of wall, or fence uncouth Disgusts the eye, which tyrant Use has rear'd, And stern Necessity forbids to change. Lur'd by their hasty shoots, and branching stems, Planters there are who choose the race of pine For this great end, erroneous; witless they That, as their arrowy heads assault the sky, They leave their shafts unfeather'd: rather thou Select the shrubs that, patient of the knife, Will thank thee for the wound, the hardy thorn, Holly, or box, privet or pyracanth. They, thickening from their base, with tenfold shade Will soon replenish all thy judgment prun'd. But chief with willing aid, her glittering green Shall England's laurel bring; swift shall she spread Her broad-leav'd shade, and float it fair and wide, Proud to be call'd an inmate of the soil. Let England prize this daughter of the East Beyond that Latian plant, of kindred name, That wreath'd the head of Julius; basely twin'd Its flattering foliage on the traitor's brow Who crush'd his country's freedom. Sacred tree, Ne'er be thy brighter verdure thus debas'd! Far happier thou, in this sequester'd bower, To shroud thy Poet, who with fost'ring hand, Here bade thee flourish, and with grateful strain Now chaunts the praise of thy maturer bloom. And happier far that Poet, if secure His hearth and altars from the pilfering slaves Of power, his little eve of lonely life May here steal on, blest with the heartfelt calm That competence and liberty inspire. Nor are the plants which England calls her own Few or unlovely, that, with laurel join'd And kindred foliage of perennial green, Will form a close-knit curtain. Shrubs there are Of bolder growth, that, at the call of Spring, Burst forth in blossom'd fragrance: lilacs rob'd In snow-white innocence, or purple pride; The sweet syringa yielding but in scent To the rich orange; or the woodbine wild That loves to hang, on barren boughs remote, Her wreaths of flowery perfume. These beside, Myriads, that here the Muse neglects to name, Will add a vernal lustre to thy veil. And what if chance collects the varied tribes, Yet fear not thou but unexpected charms Will from their union start. But if our song Supply one precept here, it bids retire Each leaf of deeper dye, and lift in front Foliage of paler verdure, so to spread A canvass, which when touch'd by Autumn's hand Shall gleam with dusky gold, or russet rays. But why prepare for her funereal hand That canvass? she but comes to dress thy shades, As lovelier victims for their wintry tomb. Rather to flowery Spring, to Summer bright, Thy labour consecrate; their laughing reign, The youth, the manhood of the growing year, Deserves that labour, and rewards its pain. Yet, heedful ever of that ruthless time When Winter shakes their stems, preserve a file With everduring leaf to brave his arm, And deepening spread their undiminish'd gloom. But, if the tall defect demands a screen Of forest shade high tow'ring, some broad roof Perchance of glaring tile that guards the stores Of Ceres; or the patch'd disjointed choir Of some old fane, whose steeple's Gothic pride Or pinnacled, or spir'd, would bolder rise ‘In tufted trees high bosom'd,’ here allot Convenient space to plant that lofty tribe Behind thy underwood, lest, o'er its head The forest tyrants shake their lordly arms, And shed their baleful dews. Each plant that springs Holds, like the people of some free-born state, Its right fair franchis'd; rooted to a spot It yet has claim to air; from liberal heav'n It yet has claim to sunshine, and to showers: Air, showers, and sunshine are its liberty. That liberty secur'd, a general shade, Dense and impervious, to thy wish shall rise To hide each form uncouth; and, this obtain'd, What next we from the Dryad powers implore Is grace, is ornament: For see! our lawn, Though cloth'd with softest verdure, though reliev'd By many a gentle fall and easy swell, Expects that harmony of light and shade, Which foliage only gives. Come then, ye plants! That, like the village troop when Maia dawns, Delight to mingle social; to the crest Of yonder brow we safely may conduct Your numerous train; no eye obstructed there Will blame your interpos'd society: But, on the plain below, in single stems Disparted, or in sparing groups distinct, Wide must ye stand, in wild, disorder'd mood, As if the seeds from which your scions sprang Had there been scatter'd from the affrighted beak Of some maternal bird whom the fierce hawk Pursued with felon claw. Her young meanwhile Callow, and cold, from their moss-woven nest Peep forth; they stretch their little eager throats Broad to the wind, and plead to the lone spray Their famish'd plaint importunately shrill. Yet in this wild disorder Art presides, Designs, corrects, and regulates the whole, Herself the while unseen. No cedar broad Drops his dark curtain where a distant scene Demands distinction. Here the thin abele Of lofty bole, and bare, the smooth'd-stemm'd beech, Or slender alder, give our eye free space Beneath their boughs to catch each lessening charm Ev'n to the far horizon's azure bound. Nor will that sov'reign arbitress admit, Where'er her nod decrees a mass of shade, Plants of unequal size, discordant kind, Or rul'd by Foliation's different laws; But for that needful purpose those prefers Whose hues are friendly, whose coëval leaves The earliest open, and the latest fade. Nor will she, scorning truth and taste, devote To strange, and alien soils, her seedling stems; Fix the dank sallow on the mountain's brow, Or, to the moss-grown margin of the lake, Bid the dry pine descend. From Nature's laws She draws her own: Nature and she are one. Nor will she, led by Fashion's lure, select, For objects interpos'd, the pigmy race Of shrubs, or scatter with unmeaning hand Their offspring o'er the lawn, scorning to patch With many a meagre and disjointed tuft Its sober surface: sidelong to her path And polish'd foreground she confines their growth Where o'er their heads the liberal eye may range. Nor will her prudence, when intent to form One perfect whole, on feeble aid depend, And give exotic wonders to our gaze. She knows and therefore fears the faithless train: Sagely she calls on those of hardy class Indigenous, who, patient of the change From heat to cold which Albion hourly feels, Are brac'd with strength to brave it. These alone She plants and prunes, nor grieves if nicer eyes Pronounce them vulgar. These she calls her friends, That veteran troop who will not for a blast Of nipping air, like cowards, quit the field. Far to the north of thy imperial towers, Augusta! in that wild and Alpine vale, Through which the Swale, by mountain-torrents swell'd, Flings his redundant stream, there liv'd a youth Of polish'd manners; ample his domain, And fair the site of his paternal dome. He lov'd the art I sing; a deep adept In Nature's story, well he knew the names Of all her verdant lineage; yet that skill Misled his taste; scornful of every bloom That spreads spontaneous, from remotest Ind He brought his foliage; careless of its cost, Ev'n of its beauty careless: it was rare, And therefore beauteous. Now his laurel screen, With rose and woodbine negligently wove, Bows to the axe; the rich magnolias claim The station; now Herculean beeches fell'd Resign their rights, and warm Virginia sends Her cedars to usurp them; the proud oak Himself, ev'n he, the sov'reign of the shade, Yields to the fir that drips with Gilead's balm. Now Albion gaze at glories not thy own! Pause, rapid Swale! and see thy margin crown'd With all the pride of Ganges: vernal showers Have fix'd their roots; nutritious summer suns Favour'd their growth; and mildest autumn smil'd Benignant o'er them: vigorous, fair, and tall, They waft a gale of spices o'er the plain. But Winter comes, and with him watery Jove, And with him Boreas in his frozen shroud; The savage spirit of old Swale is rous'd; He howls amidst his foam. At the dread sight The aliens stand aghast; they bow their heads. In vain the glassy penthouse is supply'd: The pelting storm with icy bullets breaks Its fragile barrier; see! they fade, they die. Warn'd by his error, let the planter slight These shiv'ring rarities; or if, to please Fastidious Fashion, he must needs allot Some space for foreign foliage, let him chuse A sidelong glade, shelter'd from east and north, And free to southern and to western gales; There let him fix their station; thither wind Some devious path, that, from the chief design Detach'd, may lead to where they safely bloom. So in the web of epic song sublime The Bard Mæonian interweaves the charm Of softer episode, yet leaves unbroke The golden thread of his majestic theme. What else to shun of formal, false, or vain, Of long-lin'd vistas or plantations quaint Our former strains have taught. Instruction now Withdraws; she knows her limits; knows that Grace Is caught by strong perception, not from rules; That undrest Nature claims for all her limbs Some simple garb peculiar, which, howe'er Distinct their size and shape, is simple still: This garb to chuse, with clothing dense, or thin, A part to hide, another to adorn, Is Taste's important task; preceptive song From error in the choice can only warn. But vain that warning voice; vain ev'ry aid Of Genius, Judgment, Fancy, to secure The planter's lasting fame: There is a power, A hidden power, at once his friend, and foe: 'Tis Vegetation. Gradual to his groves She gives their wish'd effect; and, that display'd, Oh, that her power would pause! but active still, She swells each stem, prolongs each vagrant bough, And darts with unremitting vigour bold From Grace to wild luxuriance. Happier far Are you, ye sons of Claude! who, from the mine, The earth, or juice of herb or flower concrete, Mingle the mass whence your Arcadias spring; The beauteous outline of your pictur'd shades Still keeps the bound you gave it; time that pales Your vivid hues, respects your pleasing forms. Not so our landscapes: though we paint like you, We paint with growing colours; ev'ry year O'erpassing that which gives the breadth of shade We sought, by rude addition mars our scene. Rouse then, ye hinds! e'er yet yon closing boughs Blot out the purple distance, swift prevent The spreading evil: thin the crowded glades, While yet of slender size each stem will thrive Transplanted: twice repeat the annual toil; Nor let the axe its beak, the saw its tooth Refrain, whene'er some random branch has stray'd Beyond the bounds of beauty; else full soon, Ev'n e'er the planter's life has past its prime, Will Albion's garden frown an Indian wild. Forboding fears avaunt! be ours to urge Each present purpose by what favouring means May work its end design'd; why deprecate The change that waits on sublunary things, Sad lot of their existence? shall we pause To give the charm of Water to our scene, For that the congregated rains may swell Its tide into a flood? or that yon Sun, Now on the Lion mounted, to his noon Impells him, shaking from his fiery mane A heat may parch its channel? O, ye caves, Deepen your dripping roofs! this feverish hour Claims all your coolness; in your humid cells Permit me to forget the planter's toil; And, while I woo your Naiads to my aid, Involve me in impenetrable gloom. Blest is the man (if bliss be human boast) Whose fertile soil is wash'd with frequent streams, And springs salubrious: he disdains to toss In rainbow dews their crystal to the sun; Or sink in subterranean cisterns deep; That so, through leaden siphons upwards drawn, Those streams may leap fantastic. He his ear Shuts to the tuneful trifling of the Bard, Who trick'd a gothic theme with classic flowers, And sung of fountains bursting from the shells Of brazen tritons, spouting through the jaws ‘Of gorgons, hydras, and chimæras dire.’ Peace to his manes! let the nymphs of Seine Cherish his fame. Thy Poet, Albion! scorns, Ev'n for a cold unconscious element To forge the fetters he would scorn to wear. His song shall reprobate each effort vile, That aims to force the Genius of the stream Beyond his native height; or dares to press Above that destin'd line th' unwilling wave. Is there within the circle of thy view Some sedgy flat, where the late-ripen'd sheaves Stand brown with unblest mildew? 'tis the bed On which an ample lake in crystal peace Might sleep majestic. Pause we yet; perchance Some midway channel, where the soil declines, Might there be delv'd, by levels duly led In bold and broken curves: for water loves A wilder outline than the woodland path, And winds with shorter bend. To drain the rest The shelving spade may toil, till wint'ry showers Find their free course down each declining bank. Quit then the thought: a river's winding form, With many a sinuous bay, and island green, At less expense of labour and of land, Will give thee equal beauty! seldom art Can emulate that broad and bold extent Which charms in native lakes; and, failing there, Her works betray their character and name, And dwindle into pools. Not that our strain, Fastidious, shall disdain a small expanse Of stagnant fluid, in some scene confin'd, Circled with varied shade, where, through the leaves, The half-admitted sunbeam trembling plays On its clear bosom; where aquatic fowl Of varied tribe, and varied feather sail; And where the finny race their glittering scales Unwillingly reveal: There, there alone, Where bursts the general prospect on our eye, We scorn these wat'ry patches: Thames himself, Seen in disjointed spots, where Sallows hide His first bold presence, seems a string of pools, A chart and compass must explain his course. He, who would seize the river's sov'reign charm, Must wind the moving mirror through his lawn Ev'n to remotest distance; deep must delve The gravelly channel that prescribes its course; Closely conceal each terminating bound By hill or shade oppos'd; and to its bank Lifting the level of the copious stream, Must there retain it. But, if thy faint springs Refuse this large supply, steel thy firm soul With stoic pride; imperfect charms despise: Beauty, like Virtue, knows no groveling mean. Who but must pity that penurious taste, Which down the quick-descending vale prolongs, Slope below slope, a stiff and unlink'd chain Of flat canals; then leads the stranger's eye To some predestin'd station, there to catch Their seeming union, and the fraud approve? Who but must change that pity into scorn, If down each verdant slope a narrow flight Of central steps decline, where the spare stream Steals trickling; or, withheld by cunning skill, Hoards its scant treasures, till the master's nod Decree its fall: Then down the formal stairs It leaps with short-liv'd fury; wasting there, Poor prodigal! what many a Summer's rain And many a Winter's snow shall late restore. Learn that, whene'er in some sublimer scene Imperial Nature of her headlong floods Permits our imitation, she herself Prepares their reservoir; conceal'd perchance In neighb'ring hills, where first it well behoves Our toil to search, and studiously augment The wat'ry store with springs and sluices drawn From pools, that on the heath drink up the rain. Be these collected, like the miser's gold, In one increasing fund, nor dare to pour, Down thy impending mound, the bright cascade, Till richly sure of its redundant fall. That mound to raise alike demands thy toil, Ere art adorn its surface. Here adopt That facile mode which his inventive powers First plann'd, who led to rich Mancunium's mart His long-drawn line of navigated stream. Stupendous task! in vain stood tow'ring hills Oppos'd; in vain did ample Irwell pour Her tide transverse: he pierc'd the tow'ring hill, He bridg'd the ample tide, and high in air, And deep through earth, his freighted barge he bore. This mode shall temper ev'n the lightest soil Firm to thy purpose. Then let taste select The unhewn fragments, that may give its front A rocky rudeness; pointed some, that there The frothy spouts may break; some slanting smooth, That there in silver sheet the wave may slide. Here too infix some moss-grown trunks of oak Romantic, turn'd by gelid lakes to stone, Yet so dispos'd as if they owed their change To what they now control. Then open wide Thy flood-gates; then let down thy torrent: then Rejoice; as if the thund'ring Tees himself Reign'd there amid his cataracts sublime. And thou hast cause for triumph! Kings themselves, With all a nation's wealth, an army's toil, If Nature frown averse, shall ne'er achieve Such wonders: Nature's was the glorious gift; Thy art her menial handmaid. Listening youths! To whose ingenuous hearts I still address The friendly strain, from such severe attempt Let Prudence warn you. Turn to this clear rill, Which, while I bid your bold ambition cease, Runs murmuring at my side: O'er many a rood Your skill may lead the wanderer; many a mound Of pebbles raise, to fret her in her course Impatient: louder then will be her song: For she will 'plain, and gurgle, as she goes, As does the widow'd ring-dove. Take, vain Pomp! Thy lakes, thy long canals, thy trim cascades, Beyond them all true taste will dearly prize This little dimpling treasure. Mark the cleft, Through which she bursts to day. Behind that rock A Naiad dwells: Lineia is her name; And she has sisters in contiguous cells, Who never saw the sun. Fond Fancy's eye, That inly gives locality and form To what she prizes best, full oft pervades Those hidden caverns, where pale chrysolites, And glittering spars dart a mysterious gleam Of inborn lustre, from the garish day Unborrow'd. There, by the wild Goddess led, Oft have I seen them bending o'er their urns, Chaunting alternate airs of Dorian mood, While smooth they comb'd their moist cerulean locks With shells of living pearl. Yes, let me own, To these, or classic deities like these, From very childhood was I prone to pay Harmless idolatry. My infant eyes First open'd on that bleak and boist'rous shore, Where Humber weds the nymphs of Trent and Ouse To His, and Ocean's Tritons: thence full soon My youth retir'd, and left the busy strand To Commerce and to Care. In Margaret's grove, Beneath whose time-worn shade old Camus sleeps, Was next my tranquil station: Science there Sat musing; and to those that lov'd the lore Pointed, with mystic wand, to truths involv'd In geometric symbols, scorning those, Perchance too much, who woo'd the thriftless muse. Here, though in warbling whisper oft I breath'd The lay, were wanting, what young Fancy deems The life-springs of her being, rocks, and caves, And huddling brooks, and torrent-falls divine. In quest of these, at Summer's vacant hour, Pleas'd would I stray, when in a northern vale, So chance ordain'd, a Naiad sad I found Robb'd of her silver vase; I sooth'd the nymph With song of sympathy, and curst the fiend Who stole the gift of Thetis. Hence the cause Why, favour'd by the blue-ey'd sisterhood, They sooth with songs my solitary ear. Nor is Lineia silent—“Long,” she cries, “Too long has Man wag'd sacrilegious war “With the vext elements, and chief with that, “Which elder Thales, and the Bard of Thebes “Held first of things terrestrial; nor misdeem'd: “For, when the Spirit creative deign'd to move, “He mov'd upon the waters. O revere “Our power: for were its vital force withheld, “Where then were Vegetation's vernal bloom, “Where its autumnal wealth? but we are kind “As powerful; O let reverence lead to love, “And both to emulation! Not a rill, “That winds its sparkling current o'er the plain, “Reflecting to the Sun bright recompense “For ev'ry beam he lends, but reads thy soul “A generous lecture. Not a pansy pale, “That drinks its daily nurture from that rill, “But breathes in fragrant accents to thy soul, ‘So by thy pity cheer'd, the languish'd head ‘Of poverty might smile.’ Who e'er beheld “Our humble train forsake their native vale “To climb the haughty hill? Ambition, speak! “He blushes, and is mute. When did our streams, “By force unpent, in dull stagnation sleep? “Let Sloth unfold his arms and tell the time. “Or, if the tyranny of Art infring'd “Our rights, when did our patient floods submit “Without recoil? Servility retires, “And clinks his gilded chain. O, learn from us, “And tell it to thy nation, British Bard! “Uncurb'd Ambition, unresisting Sloth, “And base Dependance are the fiends accurst “That pull down mighty empires. If they scorn “The awful truth, be thine to hold it dear. “So, through the vale of life, thy flowing hours “Shall glide serene; and, like Lineia's rill, “Their free, yet not licentious course fulfill'd, “Sink in the Ocean of Eternity.” END OF THE THIRD BOOK. BOOK THE FOURTH. Nor yet, divine Simplicity, withdraw That aid auspicious, which, in Art's domain, Already has reform'd whate'er prevail'd Of foreign, or of false; has led the curve That Nature loves through all her sylvan haunts; Has stol'n the fence unnotic'd that arrests Her vagrant herds; giv'n lustre to her lawns, Gloom to her groves, and, in expanse serene, Devolv'd that wat'ry mirror at her foot, O'er which she loves to bend and view her charms. And tell me thou, whoe'er hast new-arrang'd By her chaste rules thy garden, if thy heart Feels not the warm, the self-dilating glow Of true benevolence. Thy flocks, thy herds, That browse luxurious o'er those very plots Which once were barren, bless thee for the change; The birds of air (which thy funereal yews Of shape uncouth, and leaden sons of earth, Antæus and Enceladus, with clubs Uplifted, long had frighted from the scene) Now pleas'd return, they perch on ev'ry spray, And swell their little throats, and warble wild Their vernal minstrelsy; to heav'n and thee It is a hymn of thanks: do thou, like heav'n, With tutelary care reward their song. Erewhile the Muse, industrious to combine Nature's own charms, with these alone adorn'd The genius of the scene; but other gifts She has in store, which gladly now she brings, And he shall proudly wear. Know, when she broke The spells of Fashion, from the crumbling wreck Of her enchantments sagely did she cull Those reliques rich of old Vitruvian skill, With what the sculptor's hand in classic days Made breathe in brass or marble; these the hag Had purloin'd, and dispos'd in Folly's fane; To him these trophies of her victory She bears; and where his awful nod ordains Conspicuous means to place. He shall direct Her dubious judgment, from the various hoard Of ornamental treasures, how to choose The simplest and the best; on these his seal Shall stamp great Nature's image and his own, To charm for unborn ages.—Fling the rest Back to the beldame, bid her whirl them all In her vain vortex, lift them now to day, Now plunge in night, as, through the humid rack Of April cloud, swift flits the trembling beam. But precepts tire, and this fastidious age Rejects the strain didactic: try we then In livelier narrative the truths to veil We dare not dictate. Sons of Albion, hear! The tale I tell is full of strange event, And piteous circumstance; yet deem not ye, If names I feign, that therefore facts are feign'd: Nor hence refuse (what most augments the charm Of storied woe) that fond credulity Which binds th' attentive soul in closer chains. At manhood's prime Alcander's duteous tear Fell on his father's grave. The fair domain, Which then became his ample heritage, That father had reform'd; each line destroy'd Which Belgic dulness plann'd; and Nature's self Restor'd to all the rights she wish'd to claim. Crowning a gradual hill his mansion rose In antient English grandeur: Turrets, spires, And windows, climbing high from base to roof In wide and radiant rows, bespoke its birth Coëval with those rich cathedral fanes, (Gothic ill-nam'd) where harmony results From disunited parts; and shapes minute, At once distinct and blended, boldly form One vast majestic whole. No modern art Had marr'd with misplac'd symmetry the pile. Alcander held it sacred: On a height, Which westering to its site the front survey'd, He first his taste employ'd: for there a line Of thinly scatter'd beech too tamely broke The blank horizon. “Draw we round yon knowl,” Alcander cry'd, “in stately Norman mode, “A wall embattled; and within its guard “Let every structure needful for a farm “Arise in Castle-semblance; the huge barn “Shall with a mock portcullis arm the gate, “Where Ceres entering, o'er the flail-proof floor “In golden triumph rides; some tower rotund “Shall to the pigeons and their callow young “Safe roost afford; and ev'ry buttress broad, “Whose proud projection seems a mass of stone, “Give space to stall the heifer, and the steed. “So shall each part, though turn'd to rural use, “Deceive the eye with those bold feudal forms “That Fancy loves to gaze on.” This achiev'd, Now nearer home he calls returning Art To hide the structure rude where Winter pounds In conic pit his congelations hoar, That Summer may his tepid beverage cool With the chill luxury; his dairy too There stands of form unsightly: both to veil, He builds of old disjointed moss-grown stone A time-struck abbey. An impending grove Screens it behind with reverential shade; While bright in front the stream reflecting spreads, Which winds a mimic river o'er his lawn. The fane conventual there is dimly seen, The mitred window, and the cloister pale, With many a mouldering column; ivy soon Round the rude chinks her net of foliage spreads; Its verdant meshes seem to prop the wall. One native glory, more than all sublime, Alcander's scene possest: 'twas Ocean's self— He, boist'rous king, against the eastern cliffs Dash'd his white foam; a verdant vale between Gave splendid ingress to his world of waves. Slanting this vale the mound of that clear stream Lay hid in shade, which slowly lav'd his lawn: But there set free, the rill resum'd its pace, And hurried to the main. The dell it past Was rocky and retir'd: here art with ease Might lead it o'er a grot, and filter'd there, Teach it to sparkle down its craggy sides, And fall and tinkle on its pebbled floor. Here then that grot he builds, and conchs with spars, Moss petrified with branching corallines In mingled mode arranges: all found here Propriety of place; what view'd the main Might well the shelly gifts of Thetis bear. Not so the inland cave: with richer store Than those the neighb'ring mines and mountains yield To hang its roof, would seem incongruous pride, And fright the local genius from the scene. One vernal morn, as urging here the work Surrounded by his hinds, from mild to cold The season chang'd, from cold to sudden storm, From storm to whirlwind. To the angry main Swiftly he turns and sees a laden ship Dismasted by its rage. “Hie, hie we all,” Alcander cry'd, “quick to the neighb'ring beach.” They flew; they came but only to behold, Tremendous sight! the vessel dash its poop Amid the boiling breakers. Need I tell What strenuous arts were us'd, when all were us'd, To save the sinking crew? One tender maid Alone escap'd, sav'd by Alcander's arm, Who boldly swam to snatch her from the plank To which she feebly clung; swiftly to shore, And swifter to his home the youth convey'd His clay-cold prize, who at his portal first By one deep sigh a sign of life betray'd. A maid so sav'd, if but by nature blest With common charms, had soon awak'd a flame More strong than Pity, in that melting heart Which Pity warm'd before. But she was fair As poets picture Hebe, or the Spring; Graceful withal, as if each limb were cast In that ideal mould whence Raphael drew His Galatea: Yes, the impassion'd youth Felt more than pity when he view'd her charms. Yet she (ah, strange to tell) though much he lov'd, Supprest as much that sympathetic flame Which love like his should kindle: Did he kneel In rapture at her feet? she bow'd the head, And coldly bad him rise; or did he plead, In terms of purest passion, for a smile? She gave him but a tear: his manly form, His virtues, ev'n the courage that preserv'd Her life, beseem'd no sentiment to wake Warmer than gratitude; and yet the love Withheld from him she freely gave his scenes; On all their charms a just applause bestow'd; And, if she e'er was happy, only then When wand'ring where those charms were most display'd. As through a neighb'ring grove, where ancient beech Their awful foliage flung, Alcander led The pensive maid along, “Tell me,” she cry'd, “Why, on these forest features all intent, “Forbears my friend some scene distinct to give “To Flora and her fragrance? Well I know “That in the general landscape's broad expanse “Their little blooms are lost; but here are glades, “Circled with shade, yet pervious to the sun, “Where, if enamell'd with their rainbow-hues, “The eye would catch their splendour: turn thy taste, “Ev'n in this grassy circle where we stand, “To form the plots; there weave a woodbine bower, “And call that bower Nerina's.” At the word Alcander smil'd; his fancy instant form'd The fragrant scene she wish'd; and Love, with Art Uniting, soon produc'd the finish'd whole. Down to the south the glade by Nature lean'd; Art form'd the slope still softer, opening there Its foliage, and to each Etesian gale Admittance free dispensing; thickest shade Guarded the rest.—His taste will best conceive The new arrangement, whose free footsteps, us'd To forest haunts, have pierc'd their opening dells, Where frequent tufts of sweetbriar, box, or thorn, Steal on the greensward, but admit fair space For many a mossy maze to wind between. So here did Art arrange her flow'ry groups Irregular, yet not in patches quaint, But interpos'd between the wand'ring lines Of shaven turf which twisted to the path, Gravel or sand, that in as wild a wave Stole round the verdant limits of the scene; Leading the eye to many a sculptur'd bust On shapely pedestal, of sage, or bard, Bright heirs of fame, who living lov'd the haunts So fragrant, so sequester'd. Many an urn There too had place, with votive lay inscrib'd To freedom, friendship, solitude, or love. And now each flow'r that bears transplanting change, Or blooms indigenous, adorn'd the scene: Only Nerina's wish, her woodbine bower, Remain'd to crown the whole. Here, far beyond That humble wish, her lover's genius form'd A glittering fane, where rare and alien plants Might safely flourish; where the citron sweet, And fragrant orange, rich in fruit and flowers, Might hang their silver stars, their golden globes, On the same odorous stem: Yet scorning there The glassy penthouse of ignoble form, High on Ionic shafts he bad it tower A proud rotunda; to its sides conjoin'd Two broad piazzas in theatric curve, Ending in equal porticos sublime. Glass roof'd the whole, and sidelong to the south 'Twixt ev'ry fluted column, lightly rear'd Its wall pellucid. All within was day, Was genial summer's day, for secret stoves Through all the pile solstitial warmth convey'd. These led through isles of fragrance to the dome, Each way in circling quadrant. That bright space Guarded the spicy tribes from Afric's shore, Or Ind, or Araby, Sabæan plants Weeping with nard, and balsam. In the midst A statue stood, the work of Attic art; Its thin light drapery, cast in fluid folds, Proclaim'd its ancientry; all save the head, Which stole (for love is prone to gentle thefts) The features of Nerina; yet that head, So perfect in resemblance; all its air So tenderly impassion'd; to the trunk, Which Grecian skill had form'd, so aptly join'd Phidias himself might seem to have inspir'd The chissel, brib'd to do the am'rous fraud. One graceful hand held forth a flow'ry wreath, The other prest her zone; while round the base Dolphins, and Triton shells, and plants marine Proclaim'd, that Venus, rising from the sea, Had veil'd in Flora's modest vest her charms. Such was the fane, and such the Deity Who seem'd, with smile auspicious, to inhale That incense which a tributary world From all its regions round her altar breath'd: And yet, when to the shrine Alcander led His living goddess, only with a sigh, And starting tear, the statue and the dome Reluctantly she view'd. And “why,” she cry'd, “Why would my best preserver here erect, “With all the fond idolatry of love, “A wretch's image whom his pride should scorn, “(For so his country bids him)? Drive me hence, “Transport me quick to Gallia's hostile shore, “Hostile to thee, yet not, alas! to her, “Who there was meant to sojourn: there, perchance, “My father, wafted by more prosp'rous gales, “Now mourns his daughter lost; my brother there “Perhaps now sooths that venerable age “He should not sooth alone. Vain thought! perchance “Both perish'd at Esopus—do not blush, “It was not thou that lit the ruthless flame; “It was not thou, that like remorseless Cain, “Thirsted for brother's blood: thy heart disdains “The savage imputation. Rest thee there, “And, though thou pitiest, yet forbear to grace, “A wretched alien, and a rebel deem'd, “With honours ill-beseeming her to claim. “My wish, thou know'st, was humble as my state; “I only begg'd a little woodbine bower, “Where I might sit and weep, while all around “The lilies and the blue bells hung their heads “In seeming sympathy.” “Does then the scene “Displease?” the disappointed lover cry'd; “Alas! too much it pleases,” sigh'd the fair; “Too strongly paints the passion which stern Fate “Forbids me to return;” “Dost thou then love “Some happier youth?” “No; tell thy generous soul “Indeed I do not.” More she would have said, But gushing grief prevented. From the fane Silent he led her, as from Eden's bower The sire of men his weeping partner led, Less lovely, and less innocent than she. Yet still Alcander hop'd what last she sigh'd Spoke more than gratitude: the war might end; Her father might consent; for that alone Now seem'd the duteous barrier to his bliss. Already had he sent a faithful friend To learn if France the reverend exile held: That friend return'd not. Meanwhile ev'ry sun Which now (a year elaps'd) diurnal rose Beheld her still more pensive; inward pangs, From grief's concealment, hourly seem'd to force Health from her cheek, and quiet from her soul. Alcander mourn'd the change, yet still he hop'd; For Love to Hope his flickering taper lends, When Reason with his steady torch retires: Hence did he try by ever-varying arts, And scenes of novel charm her grief to calm. Nor did he not employ the syren powers Of Music and of Song; or Painting, thine, Sweet source of pure delight! But I record Those arts alone, which form my sylvan theme. At stated hours, full oft had he observ'd, She fed with welcome grain the household fowl That trespass'd on his lawn; this wak'd a wish To give her feather'd fav'rites space of land, And lake appropriate: in a neighb'ring copse He plann'd the scene; for there the crystal spring, That form'd his river, from a rocky cleft First bubbling broke to day; and spreading there Slept on its rushes. “Here my delving hinds,” He cry'd, “shall soon the marshy soil remove, “And spread, in brief extent, a glittering lake “Chequer'd with isles of verdure; on yon rock “A sculptur'd river-god shall rest his urn; “And through that urn the native fountain flow. “Thy wish-for bower, Nerina, shall adorn “The southern bank; the downy race, that swim “The lake, or pace the shore, with livelier charms, “Yet no less rural, here will meet thy glance, “Than flowers inanimate.” Full soon was scoop'd The wat'ry bed, and soon, by margin green And rising banks, inclos'd; the highest gave Site to a rustic fabric, shelving deep Within the thicket, and in front compos'd Of three unequal arches, lowly all The surer to expel the noontide glare, Yet yielding liberal inlet to the scene; Woodbine with jasmine carelessly entwin'd Conceal'd the needful masonry, and hung In free festoons, and vested all the cell. Hence did the lake, the islands, and the rock, A living landscape spread; the feather'd fleet, Led by two mantling swans, at ev'ry creek Now touch'd, and now unmoor'd; now on full sail, With pennons spread and oary feet they ply'd Their vagrant voyage; and now, as if becalm'd, 'Tween shore and shore at anchor seem'd to sleep. Around those shores the fowl that fear the stream At random rove: hither hot Guinea sends Her gadding troop; here midst his speckled dames The pigmy chanticleer of Bantam winds His clarion; while, supreme in glittering state, The peacock spreads his rainbow train, with eyes Of sapphire bright, irradiate each with gold. Meanwhile from ev'ry spray the ring-doves coo, The linnets warble, captive none, but lur'd By food to haunt the umbrage: all the glade Is life, is music, liberty, and love. And is there now to pleasure or to use One scene devoted in the wide domain Its master has not polish'd? Rumour spreads Its praises far, and many a stranger stops With curious eye to censure or admire. To all his lawns are pervious; oft himself With courteous greeting will the critic hail, And join him in the circuit. Give we here (If Candour will with patient ear attend) The social dialogue Alcander held With one, a youth of mild yet manly mein, Who seem'd to taste the beauties he survey'd. “Little, I fear me, will a stranger's eye “Find here to praise, where rich Vitruvian art “Has rear'd no temples, no triumphal arcs; “Where no Palladian bridges span the stream, “But all is homebred Fancy.” “For that cause, “And chiefly that,” the polish'd youth reply'd, “I view each part with rapture. Ornament, “When foreign or fantastic, never charm'd “My judgment; here I tread on British ground; “With British annals all I view accords. “Some Yorkist, or Lancastrian baron bold, “To awe his vassals, or to stem his foes, “Yon massy bulwark built; on yonder pile “In ruin beauteous, I distinctly mark “The ruthless traces of stern Henry's hand. “Yet,” cry'd Alcander, (interrupting mild The stranger's speech) “if so yon ancient seat, “Pride of my ancestors, had mock'd repair, “And by Proportion's Greek or Roman laws “That pile had been rebuilt, thou wouldst not then, “I trust, have blam'd, if, there on Doric shafts “A temple rose; if some tall obelisk “O'ertopt yon grove, or bold triumphal arch “Usurpt my castle's station.”—“Spare me yet “Yon solemn ruin,” the quick youth return'd, “No mould'ring aqueduct, no yawning crypt “Sepulchral, will console me for its fate.” “I mean not that,” the master of the scene Reply'd; “though classic rules to modern piles “Should give the just arrangement, shun we here “By those to form our ruins; much we own “They please, when, by Panini's pencil drawn, “Or darkly grav'd by Piranesi's hand, “And fitly might some Tuscan garden grace; “But Time's rude mace has here all Roman piles “Levell'd so low, that who, on British ground “Attempts the task, builds but a splendid lie “Which mocks historic credence. Hence the cause “Why Saxon piles or Norman here prevail: “Form they a rude, 'tis yet an English whole.” “And much I praise thy choice,” the stranger cry'd; “Such chaste selection shames the common mode, “Which, mingling structures of far distant times, “Far distant regions, here, perchance, erects “A fane to Freedom, where her Brutus stands “In act to strike the tyrant; there a tent, “With crescent crown'd, with scymitars adorn'd, “Meet for some Bajazet; northward we turn, “And lo! a pigmy pyramid pretends “We tread the realms of Pharoah; quickly thence “Our southern step presents us heaps of stone “Rang'd in a Druid circle. Thus from age “To age, from clime to clime incessant borne, “Imagination flounders headlong on, “Till, like fatigu'd Villario, soon we find “We better like a field.” “Nicely thy hand “The childish landscape touches,” cries his host, “For Fashion ever is a wayward child; “Yet sure we might forgive her faults like these, “If but in separate or in single scenes “She thus with Fancy wanton'd: should I lead “Thy step, my friend, (for our accordant tastes “Prompt me to give thee that familiar name) “Behind this screen of elm, thou there might'st find “I too had idly play'd the truant's part, “And broke the bounds of judgment.” “Lead me there,” Briskly the youth return'd, “for having prov'd “Thy Epic Genius here, why not peruse “Thy lighter Ode or Eclogue?” Smiling thence Alcander led him to the woodbine bower Which last our song describ'd, who seated there, In silent transport view'd the lively scene. “I see, his host resum'd, “my sportive art “Finds pardon here; not ev'n yon classic form, “Pouring his liquid treasures from his vase, “Though foreign from the soil, provokes thy frown. “Try we thy candor farther: higher art, “And more luxurious, haply too more vain, “Adorns yon southern coppice.” On they past Through a wild thicket, till the perfum'd air Gave to another sense its prelude rich On what the eye should feast. But now the grove Expands; and now the rose, the garden's Queen, Amidst her blooming subjects' humbler charms, On ev'ry plot her crimson pomp displays. “Oh Paradise!” the ent'ring youth exclaim'd, “Groves whose rich trees weep odorous gums and balm, “Others whose fruit, burnish'd with golden rind, “Hang amiable, Hesperian fables true, “If true here only.” Thus, in Milton's phrase Sublime, the youth his admiration pour'd, While passing to the dome; his next short step Unveil'd the central statue; “Heav'ns! just Heav'ns,” He cry'd, “'tis my Nerina.” “Thine, mad youth? “Forego the word,” Alcander said, and paus'd; His utterance fail'd; a thousand clust'ring thoughts, And all of blackest omen to his peace, Recoil'd upon his brain, deaden'd all sense, And at the statue's base him headlong cast, A lifeless load of being.—Ye, whose hearts Are ready at Humanity's soft call To drop the tear, I charge you weep not yet, But fearfully suspend the bursting woe: Nerina's self appears; the further isle She, fate-directed, treads. Does she too faint? Would Heav'n she could! it were a happy swoon Might soften her fixt form, more rigid now Than is her marble semblance. One stiff hand Lies leaden on her breast; the other rais'd To heav'n, and half-way clench'd; steadfast her eyes, Yet viewless; and her lips, which op'd to shriek, Can neither shriek nor close. So might she stand For ever: He whose sight caus'd the dread change, Though now he clasps her in his anxious arm, Fails to unbend one sinew of her frame; 'Tis ice; 'tis steel. But see, Alcander wakes; And waking, as by magic sympathy, Nerina whispers, “all is well, my friend; “'Twas but a vision; I may yet revive— “But still his arm supports me; aid him, friend, “And bear me swiftly to my woodbine bower: “For there indeed I wish to breathe my last.” So saying, her cold cheek, and parched brow, Turn'd to a livid paleness; her dim eyes Sunk in their sockets; sharp contraction prest Her temples, ears, and nostrils: signs well known To those that tend the dying. Both the youths Perceiv'd the change; and had stern Death himself Wav'd his black banner visual o'er their heads, It could not more appall. With trembling step, And silent, both convey'd her to the bower. Her languid limbs there decently compos'd, She thus her speech resum'd: “Attend my words “Brave Cleon! dear Alcander! generous pair: “For both have tender interest in this heart “Which soon shall beat no more. That I am thine “By a dear father's just commands I own, “Much-honour'd Cleon! take the hand he gave, “And with it, Oh, if I could give my heart, “Thou wert its worthy owner. All I can, “(And that preserv'd with chastest fealty) “Duteous I give thee, Cleon it is thine; “Not ev'n this dear preserver, e'er could gain “More from my soul than friendship—that be his; “Yet let me own, what, dying, sooths the pang, “That, had thyself and duty ne'er been known, “He must have had my love.” She paus'd; and dropt A silent tear: then prest the stranger's hand; Then bow'd her head upon Alcander's breast, And “bless them both, kind Heav'n!” she pray'd and died. “And blest art thou,” cry'd Cleon, (in a voice Struggling with grief for utterance) blest to die “Ere thou hadst question'd me, and I perforce “Had told a tale which must have sent thy soul “In horror from thy bosom. Now it leaves “A smile of peace upon those pallid lips, “That speaks its parting happy. Go, fair saint! “Go to thy palm-crown'd father! thron'd in bliss, “And seated by his side, thou wilt not now “Deplore the savage stroke that seal'd his doom; “Go hymn the Fount of Mercy, who, from ill “Educing good, makes ev'n a death like his, “A life surcharg'd with tender woes like thine, “The road to joys eternal. Maid, farewell! “I leave the casket that thy virtues held “To him whose breast sustains it; more belov'd, “Perhaps more worthy, yet not loving more “Than did thy wretched Cleon.” At the word He bath'd in tears the hand she dying gave, Return'd it to her side, and hasty rose. Alcander starting from his trance of grief, Cry'd “Stay, I charge thee stay:” “and shall he stay,” Cleon reply'd, “whose presence stabb'd thy peace? “Hear this before we part: That breathless Maid “Was daughter to a venerable Sage, “Whom Boston, when with peace and safety blest, “In rapture heard pour from his hallow'd tongue “Religion's purest dictates. 'Twas my chance, “In early period of our civil broils, “To save his precious life: And hence the Sire “Did to my love his daughter's charms consign; “But, till the war should cease, if ever cease, “Deferr'd our nuptials. Whither she was sent “In search of safety, well, I trust, thou know'st; “He meant to follow; but those ruthless flames, “That spar'd nor friend nor foe, nor sex nor age, “Involv'd the village, where on sickly couch “He lay confin'd, and whither he had fled “Awhile to sojourn. There (I see thee shrink) “Was he, that gave Nerina being, burnt! “Burnt by thy countrymen! to ashes burnt! “Fraternal hands and christian lit the flame.— “Oh thou hast cause to shudder. I meanwhile “With his brave son a distant warfare wag'd: “And him, now I have found the prize I sought, “And finding lost, I hasten to rejoin; “Vengeance and glory call me.” At the word, Not fiercer does the tigress quit her cave To seize the hinds that robb'd her of her young, Than he the bower. “Stay, I conjure thee, stay,” Alcander cry'd; but ere the word was spoke Cleon was seen no more. “Then be it so,” The youth continued, clasping to his heart The beauteous corse, and smiling as he spoke, (Yet such a smile as far out-sorrows tears) “Now thou art mine entirely—Now no more “Shall duty dare disturb us—Love alone— “But hark! he comes again—Away vain fear! “'Twas but the fluttering of thy feather'd flock. “True to their custom'd hour, behold they troop “From island, grove, and lake. Arise my love, “Extend thy hand—I lift it, but it falls. “Hence then, fond fools, and pine! Nerina's hand “Has lost the power to feed you. Hence and die.” Thus plaining, to his lips the icy palm He lifted, and with ardent passion kiss'd; Then cry'd in agony, “on this dear hand, “Once tremblingly alive to Love's soft touch, “I hop'd to seal my faith:” This thought awak'd Another sad soliloquy, which they, Who e'er have lov'd, will from their hearts supply, And they who have not will but hear and smile. And let them smile; but let the scorners learn There is a solemn luxury in grief Which they shall never taste; well known to those, And only those, in Solitude's deep gloom Who heave the sigh sincerely: Fancy there Waits the fit moment; and, when Time has calm'd The first o'erwhelming tempest of their woe, Piteous she steals upon the mourner's breast Her precious balm to shed: Oh, it has power, Has magic power to soften and to sooth, Thus duly minister'd. Alcander felt The charm, yet not till many a ling'ring moon Had hung upon her zenith o'er his couch, And heard his midnight wailings. Does he stray But near the fated temple, or the bower? He feels a chilly monitor within Who bids him pause. Does he at distance view His grot? 'tis darken'd with Nerina's storm, Ev'n at the blaze of noon. Yet there are walks The lost one never trod; and there are seats Where he was never happy by her side, And these he still can sigh in. Here at length, As if by chance, kind Fancy brought her aid, When wand'ring through a grove of sable yew, Rais'd by his ancestors: their Sabbath-path Led through its gloom, what time too dark a stole Was o'er Religion's decent features drawn By puritanic zeal. Long had their boughs Forgot the sheers; the spire, the holy ground They banish'd by their umbrage. “What if here,” Cry'd the sweet soother, in a whisper soft, “Some open space were form'd, where other shades, “Yet all of solemn sort, cypress and bay “Funereal, pensive birch its languid arms “That droops, with waving willows deem'd to weep, “And shiv'ring aspens mixt their varied green; “What if yon trunk, shorn of its murky crest, “Reveal'd the sacred fane?” Alcander heard The Charmer; ev'ry accent seem'd his own, So much they touch'd his heart's sad unison. “Yes, yes,” he cry'd, “Why not behold it all? “That bough remov'd shews me the very vault “Where my Nerina sleeps, and where, when heav'n “In pity to my plaint the mandate seals, “My dust with her's shall mingle.” Now his hinds, Call'd to the task, their willing axes wield: Joyful to see, as witless of the cause, Their much-lov'd lord his sylvan arts resume. And next, within the centre of the gloom, A shed of twisting roots and living moss, With rushes thatch'd, with wattled oziers lin'd, He bids them raise: it seem'd a hermit's cell; Yet void of hour-glass, scull, and maple dish, Its mimic garniture: Alcander's taste Disdains to trick, with emblematic toys, The place where he and Melancholy mean To fix Nerina's bust, her genuine bust, The model of the marble. There he hides, Close as a miser's gold, the sculptur'd clay; And but at early morn and latest eve Unlocks the simple shrine, and heaves a sigh: Then does he turn, and through the glimm'ring glade Cast a long glance upon her house of death; Then views the bust again, and drops a tear. Is this idolatry, ye sage ones say?— Or, if ye doubt, go view the num'rous train Of poor and fatherless his care consoles; The sight will tell thee, he that dries their tears Has unseen angels hov'ring o'er his head, Who leave their heav'n to see him shed his own. Here close we, sweet Simplicity! the tale, And with it let us yield to youthful bards That Dorian reed we but awak'd to voice When Fancy prompted, and when Leisure smil'd; Hopeless of general praise, and well repaid, If they of classic ear, unpall'd by rhyme, Whom changeful pause can please, and numbers free, Accept our song with candour. They perchance, Led by the Muse to solitude and shade, May turn that art we sing to soothing use, At this ill-omen'd hour, when Rapine rides In titled triumph; when Corruption waves Her banners broadly in the face of day, And shews th' indignant world the host of slaves She turns from Honour's standard. Patient there, Yet not desponding, shall the sons of Peace Await the day, when, smarting with his wrongs, Old England's Genius wakes; when with him wakes That plain integrity, contempt of gold, Disdain of slav'ry, liberal awe of rule Which fixt the rights of people, peers, and prince, And on them founded the majestic pile Of British Freedom; bad fair Albion rise The scourge of tyrants; sovereign of the seas; And arbitress of empires. Oh return, Ye long-lost train of Virtues! swift return To save ('tis Albion prompts your Poet's prayer) Her throne, her altars, and her laureat bowers. END OF THE FOURTH BOOK. RELIGIO CLERICI. OR THE FAITH OF A CLERGYMAN OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND; WRITTEN IN IMITATION OF MR. DRYDEN'S RELIGIO LAICI, 1796. —????????????? ?? ???? ??????????? ???? ?????? ??????. ?????. 3. PART THE FIRST. Dryden, if rightly of his powers I deem, Apply'd with skill his numbers to his theme: If 'twas heroic, then his nervous rhyme Rose on an eagle's plume, and soar'd to heights sublime; Or, if preceptive, then in vernal skies, As near the ground the circling swallow flies And skims, not touches; so his verses keep Their march pedestrian, stoop, yet scorn to creep, And, like his prose, perspicuous, manly, free, Surpass it only in its melody. Rare excellence! In this how few succeed! How few, like him, could write a Layman's Creed, Make logic's rules to metre's laws submit, Blend truth with fancy, argument with wit! Yet this he did; and in so smooth a lay, It satisfied the nicer ear of Gray, Who always held it as the guide supreme Of bards employ'd on a didactic theme. Yet whether or from mother-wit or use, For constant practice surely drilled his Muse, He here succeeded may create a doubt; A veteran's talents let not me dispute: Yet, now, so universal is the rage Of writing, in our most enlighten'd age, That myriads of each sex (I scorn to fib) Now scan so nimbly, and now rhyme so glib, They seem to claim all Dryden's eloquence, And leave him merely spirit, meaning, sense. So much for introduction. Now, my friend, Best lov'd of few remaining, condescend To hear his senior, though of after time Yet mere apprentice in the craft of rhyme, Produce his creed, not laical, yet free, He trusts, from theologic pedantry, Which you, who know him, will believe his own, And not put on with surplice, band, and gown. Nor blame him, if its import be the same With that, which bears th' Egyptian bishop's name, Whose rigid preface though the Bard arraign'd, He own'd “the creed eternal truth contain'd.” But here lay Dryden's error. He conceiv'd The zealous prelate bade it be believ'd On his own ipse dixit, and we find Many good churchmen still of Dryden's mind: Indeed so many mid a sceptic crowd, I scarce can wonder Tillotson avow'd His wish 'twere from the Liturgy remov'd. Not because false; he ne'er suppos'd it so, But if remov'd (vain hope) that it might draw, By firmer cords of unity and love, To one true faith, that creed who disapprove. But why arraign the preface? if it came From man, if scripture did not say the same; Or if discordant from its gen'ral code, With Dryden I'd refuse the Pharisaic load. Yet if in Christian soil, and that alone, The tree must spring, that by its fruit is known; And if its root be Faith, all must agree To take the scion from the parent tree; No foreign stem, if grafted there, can shoot; No truth can bloom on error's baneful root: All hope to save it is a vain desire, Down it is dash'd, and flung into the fire. Methinks, I hear some pert Priestleian cry, “Must Christians then on metaphors rely? “The creed, you copy, tells us plain and brief, “Endless perdition follows unbelief.” Quit then the metaphor; its meaning take; You'll find it His who spake as no man spake. From him, not man, I copy; and his word Shall be the sum and substance I record, Touching my creed; if from his word I learn, That faith in him is my supreme concern; If wanting that, I lose the blessing high, His blood has purchas'd, Immortality, What may I hope? If I from reason draw Conclusions unsupported by his law, Mistate, abridge the doctrines he has given, I lose all place in my Redeemer's heav'n; And, whether I or Athanasius speak, The prize is lost, he purchas'd for my sake. What then remains? the unbeliever's doom, Endless perdition in a life to come? Who founds his faith on Revelation's base Must hold, that all of Adam's sinful race Inherit death from their delinquent sire: Yet still may christian Charity aspire, To nurse a modest hope that those who lie Uncherish'd by the Day-spring from on high May still be blest, ev'n though a tenfold shade Of Pagan darkness now involves their head; And only those, the obstinately blind, Will meet the doom intail'd on lost mankind. Hence the same Charity, heart-cheering guest, That burnt, with fervent flame, in Dryden's breast, Inspirits mine; that Charity, which Paul Says “hopeth all things, and believeth all,” But this is not reveal'd: what is alone The true believer dares to call his own. More he may hope, and he that hopes the most, Though haply by some waves of error tost, Will steer his Christian bark from quicksands free, Whose helm is Faith, whose sail is Charity. This stumbling-stone remov'd, I scarce shall need To free our Alexandrian prelate's creed From those objectors, who conceive it meant Purely to threaten those, who dare dissent From Faith established, not by Heav'n but man, And hence abjure its persecuting plan. Alas! while man is man there will be found Those, who on this, or any creed will ground, Or none at all, some false pretence to draw The scymitar; and, scorning every law Divine or human, like the deluge, flood Their native country with their brethren's blood. Ask you for proof from bigot zeal? review Charles's dread deeds on Saint Bartholomew. Ask you for proofs from want of Faith? They're clear In the dread deeds of Danton and Robespierre. Weigh'd on the beam of justice, not of Bayle! See then which separate evil turns the scale, What, equal! Surely then Lucretius ly'd, Who cast his make-weight on Religion's side. But he, who duly marks th' historic page, Will find my creed confess'd in that same age, When Arius triumph'd now, was now subdu'd, As emp'rors or as empresses allow'd, When common-sense was scorn'd, and quibbling priz'd, When myst'ry found itself more mysticis'd, Will sanely judge a creed, whose ev'ry phrase Was form'd to free from the scholastic maze Well-meaning christians: might securely fix Their faith on Scripture, not on schismatics. Thus far, methinks, with prudent step I steer, Nor yet can have offended L?'s ear With Trinity, to him a word of fear: L?, who learns his heresy by rote, And would be nothing, if deny'd to quote. Nor will I use it from its adjunct free, But join it evermore with Unity; Reclaim the term, he and his tribe have stole, (With them such larceny, though great, is small) For, this purloin'd, they but to us concede One fragment of this mutilated creed; A creed, to those, who take its meaning right, That strictly keeps one Deity in sight; Form'd as a bulwark, and a bulwark strong, 'Gainst all, on that dread theme who swerve from right to wrong; Yet, if we leave them of that term possest, They brand us for idolators profest, Who to three Gods our adoration pay, And might with Papists to God's mother pray; While they relinquishing their former name, Flutter on Unitarian wings to fame, To Unitarian worship rear the dome, And bid all half-believing Christians come, Provided they put off their wedding vest, Like halt and blind, to their new-garnish'd feast Of dishes second-hand, and badly drest. But quit we these; and while we scorn to own Our faith refers to Trinity alone, Yet still it holds, as Scripture held before, One undivided, one exalted pow'r, That in the Father and the Son resides, And Sacred Spirit, purest, best of guides. But wherefore holds? only as far as man The mystic height of godliness may scan, We may conceive God gives our mortal race Salvation, not for merit, but from grace; That from the Son divine Redemption springs, That the pure Spirit, once on dove-like wings Descending visibly, still deigns to dart Its secret aid on each submissive heart. Thus, though deriv'd from one exhaustless spring Three plenteous streams redundant blessings bring, The fountain head united with them all We may not three, but One conjointly call. “This too is metaphor?” Socinian, yes: But, if a false one, prove me that it is. Water is still call'd water, if it glide Or in a trinal, or a single tide; So God in Gospel language is apply'd To all the wonders of supernal power, That from the Sire, and Son, and Spirit show'r. Resting on this, I first believe with Paul One God, who is, was, shall be, all in all; Yet, as with him I find in holy writ, Another person, and another yet Reveal'd distinct, the Father, and the Son, And hallow'd Spirit; I include in one The three distinctions, and believe all three One comprehensive sole Divinity. Thus on the terms, by which I was baptis'd, That charter great, which seal'd me christianiz'd, I take with confidence the certain road, That leads through Scripture up to Scripture's God. That he is One, plain Reason can descry; And when his word presents him to the eye, Reliev'd by faith from error, still must shine One Being indivisibly divine. Hence, howsoe'er the artful Arians aim This old confession of our faith to blame, 'Twas meant to One Divinity to raise Due adoration both in prayer and praise: Else why does it repeat “not three, but one” Ev'n to tautology? Why not alone To ev'ry person of the sacred Three Ascribe a single, disjoin'd Deity? Too soon, alas! ev'n in th' Apostles' age Did heresy defile the Gospel page, Led by false science and scholastic rage. Then rose that zeal for novelty, which made Verbal theology a gainful trade: Nor could a common scholar open shop, Till he of terms had gain'd a num'rous crop To fill his mental granary: with his hoard Of these he first the market price explor'd, Then 'gan to speculate, as farmers do, Reserv'd the old and traffick'd with the new: And, if he well could vend false eloquence, Car'd not what famine starv'd poor common sense. But when scholastic owl-light was withdrawn, And real science now had past its dawn, Divines there were, who deem'd the deed no theft To borrow what their ancestors had left, Yet sifted ev'ry term before they us'd, The good adopted, and the bad refus'd; Then stampt the first for sterling. Thus, we see, With others they selected Trinity; Nor scrupled they, if Paganish, to use A word, that none but Deists could abuse; A word, with Unity when closely join'd, Which brief and clear the scripture truth defin'd; That God in trinal persons, trinal ways, His one eternal majesty displays. “But how?”—That question soon may be dismiss'd, When Darwin shows how he and I exist; For, by Lavoisier taught (that sage I mean Whom Freedom's bastards chose to guillotine). He knows two Gnomes produced from mine or moat, In Gallic-Greek call'd Carbone and Azote, By secret spells allure to their embrace Bright Oxygen, a Sylph of heavenly race, Mix with her purity their filth and fire To form that atmosphere we both respire Which did they not, nor he could screw his lyre To that high pitch, which blabs what strange amours Are carried on in Flora's secret bowers, Nor I unscrew my own to tones so low, It merely gives to prose a verse-like flow, Truths to describe, which clearly to explain Reason's dim lamp has burnt for centuries in vain. “A strange confession!”—But does Darwin more? He names three fluids; he describes their pow'r When separate; he demonstrates that they give Conjoin'd that pabulum by which we live; But how they join'd at first, and why they still Th' ethereal void with the same mixture fill, Let him explain, ere you demand from me What forms the undivided Trinity. No more of Deity, than Gospel light Reveals, can ere be plain to Reason's sight. Is more reveal'd, than clearly she conceives? Calm she submits, yet piously believes. But, though she here perceives herself confin'd, Let none but Atheists dare to call her blind. She still is Reason, still exerts the pow'r, By which she fixt her premises before, That God is truth, and this conclusion drew Justly, that all he speaks must needs be true, Though all not clear alike to her contracted view. Of these what follow are in Scripture strain, Some beyond Reason, some to Reason plain. It says creative Power, redeeming Love, And sanctifying Grace are from above: It bids us duely venerate the Son, Ev'n as the Sire; it tells us not alone From Sire, but Son, the Comforter is sent To man; if then by both that gift be lent, Which only they can lend, the three combine In one ineffable sublime design, And are, as one, all equally divine. It tells us that, though nominally three, And thence call'd persons, some diversity To two attaches. All are uncreate, Yet is the Son's a generated state, Before all worlds begotten by the Sire, And thence from both thy soul-inspiring fire, O sacred Paraclete! proceeding free Gives thee with both divine equality, Which, whether God or Lord we choose to call, Must not be said of One, but said of all. Thus far some truths, all Christians should receive Who hope salvation, I have try'd to give In careless metre, not in labour'd lays; Yet if a verse (as pious Herbert says) “May chance to find him, who a sermon flies, “And turn delight into a sacrifice,” So these perus'd with candour, may dispel Some scruples, that with almost-Christians dwell. I trust, at least, that the impartial few Will find that doctrine, they before thought true, Not here disguis'd, though clad in vesture new. PART THE SECOND. Of all the aberrations I can find In the mixt memoirs of the human mind, None so eccentric veers from common sense As theirs, who to believing make pretence, Who text on text adapt to systems vain, Reject the difficult, perplex the plain, And, weighing in false scales Redemption's plan, Decide the Lord, who bought them, was but man; A prophet, if you please, or somewhat more, A sage endow'd with legislative power, As was the son of Jethro, and inspir'd Far as his mission, but no more requir'd: Yet this to preach, to publish o'er and o'er, Modern philosophy has stretch'd her power, And doubtless will to giddier heights advance, When she has fully fraterniz'd with France. Give me such foes as Frederic or Voltaire, Who wage with Revelation open war, Or two less lively, but not less profane, ?, M. P. and Citizen Tom Paine; But these of sceptics the left-handed fry, So primly liberal, so demurely sly, Who say our faith they mean but to refine, While at its base they try to spring the mine Laid long ago by Polish pioneers; These move my scorn, they cannot rouse my fears; Firm on that faith, its heav'nly builder plann'd, The time-proof fabric of the Church shall stand, And ev'ry human enemy repel, For fortified by heav'n, it braves the gates of hell. If then in England's fruitful nursery rise Such heresies as this of giant size, Through which a thousand minor planters run, Busy as day-flies in the noontide sun, To propagate by cuttings, or to graft On varying stocks, as suits their varying craft, I much suspect their labour will be lost, Now the head-gard'ner, in himself a host, Self-exil'd wanders to New England's coast. Vain man! the tares he in the Old has sown, He thinks are to such full perfection grown, Will now so little care, or wat'ring want, L?, or L? may nurse each plant, When, by some lucky opposition hit, They've over-turn'd the Church, the Test, and Pitt. “Imprudent Poet!” says some grave divine, “Let not a Muse so orthodox as thine “Descend to wit or humour.”—Pardon, Sir; The readers of this age require a spur Nicely apply'd to tickle, not to goad, If you would wish to keep them in your road. Pope, when he reason'd, deem'd it right to steer “From grave to gay, from lively to severe”— “Admit he did, the difference you must see “Is great; his theme was mere morality, “While yours”—I know 'tis of that torrent kind, It quite o'erflows all bounds of human mind; Nay, fill'd angelic minds with warm desire Some glimpse of that high myst'ry to acquire; But I, who other readers have in view, Frankly confess, I do not write for you. You can from Chillingworth or Hooker gain Drugs, that best purge from heresy the brain; And antidotes to errors so absurd Prepar'd by Jones, Burgh, Cleaver, Horseley, Hurd. But their prescriptions, Doctor, ne'er would mend The fashionable patients I attend: Their malady, at once both old and new, Partakes of fever, and of dropsy too: He, therefore, who with skill their case would treat, Must give them med'cines that both cool and heat. For you, and such as you, a solemn theme Must still be handled solemn in extreme: If controversial, heavy arms alone, The weaver's beam, and not the sling and stone, Must be each champion's weapon; to employ A flash of wit, by way of feu de joie, Like Warburton; you deem incongruous quite, And, though a victor, blame the dang'rous wight, Adhering ever to this golden rule, A stanch Polemic must be strictly dull. I'll not, for his trim periods, court the thief Who tries to swindle me of my belief; Nor the dull game of mock politeness play, With men involv'd in Paul's anathema. Yet I, like you, Lord Shaftsbury's rule detest, Which sets up ridicule, of truth the test: You surely then with safety may admit Detected falsehood, a fair butt for wit. Hence on my present theme, as on the past, I sprinkle grains of salt to give it taste, That those may read, who never redde before, And those, who read already, may read more. With this apology, my reverend Friend, Perchance, Right Reverend, I my preface end, And here assert, just as I first began, That all, who Scripture's genuine sense would scan, Must hold the Son of God both God and Man. God, whom the eternal generating Sire Did with his full divinity inspire; First of the first of all, and last of last, Beyond all count of future, present, past; For merely from beginning down to end, Our pigmy calculating powers extend, From step to step o'er days, years, ages, climb, Curb'd by the scant arithmetic of time; And can but mark, by mensuration clear, A few brief digits of duration's sphere; Hence all we know is that with God he sprung Before heav'n's curtain o'er creation hung, Before the morning stars their first glad chorus sung. True, as the turnsole to the orb of light, The genuine Christian keeps this faith in sight, Nor doubts the fact, because he knows the end, For which that God did from his Sire descend, Disrob'd himself of glory, and became A man in substance, and a man in name; Of woman-born, in whom each mortal eye Saw all itself, save its impurity: Thus, while a perfect man on earth he shone, The perfect Deity was still his own; Inferior only to his Sire on high But as invested with humanity: Thus when with heav'nly earthly we compare, Both soul and body claim an equal share In our formation; so in his were join'd Terrestrial substance with celestial mind. Hence, though both God and Man, as Christ alone We from his birth but one Redeemer own; That wond'rous birth, by which he man became, While his pure godhead still remain'd the same, Yet, by such union intimately join'd, As in our frame, the body, soul, or mind; They therefore, who preserve the Gospel clue, As God and Man their sole Messiah view. “But is such union possible?” With God All things are possible—Take Butler's road; Travel the path of plain analogy, 'Twill lead at least to probability, And sure, when demonstration is deny'd, Reason should in the next best thing confide. Think ye, if Locke or Newton in a glass Survey'd the reflex image of his face, Would he from thence conclude he view'd the whole? No, he would know he had an unseen soul Illumining each feature, and decide That soul, he could not from himself divide. This granted, next suppose the soul, thus join'd To substance, were not to that mass confin'd, But could diffuse itself; the thoughts discern Of other souls, their wants, their weakness learn, And hence, with faculties of amplest reach, Far, far beyond the puny powers of speech, Transfuse by intuition, and dispense All that was needful of superior sense; In such a Newton, or a Locke you'd see No faint resemblance of a Trinity; Two parts of which, when nature first began, Form'd God's own image, and was call'd a man, But when the Word, made flesh, with mortals dwelt, That Word alone the trinal Union felt. Till then the world was wrapt in shades of night. Glory to Israel, to the Gentiles light His saving advent spread. Where'er he trod Creation bow'd, and own'd th' incarnate God. Celestial pow'rs his mighty mission seal'd; Dæmons he vanquish'd, raging storms he still'd; Gave to the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, Eyes to the blind, and sinews to the weak; To sinners pardon, precepts to mankind, And to each rule his bright example join'd. In these blest works his ev'ry hour employ'd; For man he liv'd in toil, in torments died; Died, though his voice before its power had prov'd To call from death to life the friend he lov'd; Yet prompt to execute his Father's will, Prompt the sure word of prophecy to seal With his own blood, he pass'd through thy domain, Dread Hades! from the grave he rose again, Sojourn'd some space with his selected few, Enough to prove his resurrection true, Then on a brilliant cloud ascending high, Sat at his Sire's right hand, the filial Deity. Come, ye vain worldly disputants, and read This single portion of my general Creed! Then say, if here I paint his portrait true, First in an earthly, then a heav'nly view; And when each sacred feature I define, From scripture copying closely line by line, I am not justified, on reason's plan, To deem my Saviour God, as well as Man, And with him to the Sire and Spirit raise One undivided hymn of equal praise? Deny you this?—Then go, as you think meet, Or to America or Essex-street, The last is nearest, and you there may buy, Neat as imported, ev'ry fresh supply Of that lean faith, which suits your palates best, Much like the food in new French kitchens drest, A la Republicaine; no need to carve, The soupe's so maigre, you may eat, yet starve. For me, I wait that future day of doom With hope, through faith, which soon or late must come, When man's probation finally shall end, When Christ, the King of glory, shall descend Amply triumphant, borne on Seraph's wing; When all Heav'n's chorus loud Hosannas sing, When earth convulsive bursts, when Ether flames, When the last trumpet of my God proclaims Messiah present; when that Judge most just Shall weigh the merits of the sons of dust, Rais'd in immortal bodies, yet the same, That some must wear to honour, some to shame, Yet all must wear; for Death, the last of foes, Subdu'd, Mortality's vain scene will close, And good and bad eternally remain, Those crown'd with glory, these consign'd to pain, This is the faith, the sacred page reveals; This the sole Charter of Salvation seals. And now, my friend, if thy severest eye An error in my Christian creed descry; An error but in substance, not in style, I pray thee use thy hatchet, not thy file, And hew it down. Let slighter faults remain. Enough for me, if this familiar strain Give to the general ear its meaning plain. There are, who, more than pathos or sublime, Love fluent verse when link'd with easy rhyme; For these I write. Let those who write for fame, Or trade in print, pursue their humbler aim. Truth! Truth reveal'd! be thou my hallow'd theme, And if, through vacant youth's delirious dream, Or ev'n maturest manhood, far too long I've wander'd, with more favour'd sons of song, Through fancy's maze; 'tis meet my green old age Should prompt me, or to check the tuneful rage, Or clothe in verse truths, when ordain'd to teach In prose, by duty I was bound to preach; And, when those truths surpass'd all human wit, Bid Reason modestly to Faith submit, Holding this best of maxims still in view, What God declares, though darkly, must be true. Confirm'd in this, yet witless of the ways, By which that God his inward grace conveys To sinful souls, in many a musing hour I've thus invok'd his salutary power— “Spirit of inward purity, control The wild conceptions of my wayward soul! When memory, counting long past follies o'er, Delights to dwell on what it should deplore, And, musing or on vain, or vicious toys, The fruits of rising penitence destroys, Come to thy vot'ry, come, celestial guest, And drive the busy demon from my breast! So shall each passion, purified by thee, Be all dissolv'd in fervent Piety; So shall weak reason, strengthen'd by thy grace, The path, that leads to sure salvation, trace Through that firm faith alone, which justifies, In my Redeemer's living sacrifice; Prov'd by its works, which, like the Saints above, Abounds in acts of Charity and Love.” Thus I—Let others, who despise the strain, And deem all aid of grace internal vain To cure the general atrophy of mind, Their sov'reign cure in their own reason find. Grant, Heav'n, they may! Such cures, I fear, are rare. Let me with David give myself to prayer; Prayer, the true solace of the sickly soul, When rul'd by Resignation's meek control, Or join'd to that, the tribute of the heart, Which, fir'd with fervour unallay'd by art, Rolls the pure stream of gratitude along, In prose prepar'd, or soul-expanding song, For blessings pour'd from blessings sov'reign spring Fir'd with such gratitude, I now will sing What best may sanctify, and best may end That Christian Creed, a Christian Priest has penn'd. “Father, Redeemer, Comforter divine! This humble off'ring to thy equal shrine Here thy unworthy servant grateful pays Of undivided thanks, united praise, For all those mercies, which at birth began, And ceaseless flow'd through life's long-lengthen'd span; Propt my frail frame through all the varied scene, With health enough for many a day serene; Enough of science clearly to discern How few important truths the wisest learn; Enough of arts ingenuous to employ The vacant hours, when graver studies cloy; Enough of wealth to serve each honest end, The poor to succour, or assist a friend; Enough of faith in Scripture to descry, That the sure hope of immortality, Which only can the fear of death remove, Flows from the fountain of Redeeming Love. HYMNS, AND SELECT PSALMS VERSIFIED. HYMN BEFORE MORNING SERVICE. Again the day returns of holy rest Which, when he made the world, Jehovah blest; When, like his own, he bade our labour cease, And all be piety, and all be peace. While impious men despise the sage decree, From “vain deceit, and false philosophy;” Let us its wisdom own, its blessings feel, Receive with gratitude, perform with zeal. Let us devote this consecrated day To learn his will, and all we learn obey; In pure Religion's hallow'd duties share, And join in penitence, and join in prayer. So shall the God of Mercy pleas'd receive That only tribute, man has power to give; So shall he hear, while fervently we raise Our choral harmony in hymns of praise. CHORUS. Father of Heaven, in whom our hopes confide, Whose pow'r defends us, and whose precepts guide; In life our guardian, and in death our friend Glory supreme be thine till time shall end! HYMN BEFORE EVENING SERVICE. Soon will the evening star with silver ray Shed its mild lustre on this sacred day; Resume we then, ere sleep and silence reign, The rites that holiness and Heav'n ordain. Still let each awful truth our thoughts engage, That shines reveal'd on Inspiration's page: Nor those blest hours in vain amusements waste Which all, who lavish, shall lament at last. Here humbly let us hope our Maker's smile Will crown with meet success our weekly toil; And here, on each returning Sabbath join In prayer, in penitence, and praise divine. CHORUS. Father of Heaven, in whom our hopes confide, Whose pow'r defends us, and whose precepts guide; In life our guardian, and in death our friend, Glory supreme be thine till time shall end! This and the foregoing Hymn are adapted to an elegant movement of Pleyel, in his Opera twenty-third. They have been also set to music by Dr. Burney and Mr. M. Camidge. MORNING HYMN. I That, from refreshing sleep I rise With health and reason blest, Accept, great God, the sacrifice Of thanks that warms my breast. II And O! may thy assisting grace Conduct me through the day, Lest Passion tempt, or Vice debase, Or Vanity betray. III Correct each thought, each wish control Save those thy laws approve, And pour on my repentant soul Thy pardon, peace, and love. EVENING HYMN. I To sleep, Death's image, I resign This night my pillow'd head, Lord! let thy providence divine From danger guard my bed. II But should I sleep to wake no more, Or, with to-morrow's sun, Have life thy goodness to adore, Father, thy will be done. III This only be my constant prayer, That, when Life's pulse shall cease, My Soul, redeem'd by thee, may share Thy pardon, love, and peace. These two last Hymns and the following Psalms versified are now first published. PSALM I. Happy the man who scorns to join That impious race who truth deride, Who wisely makes the law divine His nightly study, daily guide. Like some fair tree, ordain'd to shade The margin of a plenteous stream, Sublime he waves his leafy head, His boughs with fruit maturely teem. Compar'd with his, each sickly bloom Of Vice and Folly swift decay, The passing gale conveys their doom, And whirls them, like the dust, away. The just, who make their God their guide, His presence only shall enjoy, The impious, who his laws deride, His wrath vindictive shall destroy. PSALM VIII. Guardian and Governor divine! Who built thy glory's radiant shrine Sublime above the solar blaze; On earth how excellent thy name, Ev'n infant tongues, the foe to shame, Thou arm'st with power to hymn thy praise. Dread Maker! when my eyes behold Yon moon, yon planets girt in gold, O what is man! entranc'd I cry, O what his son! that he should rise So near the inmates of the skies, So near angelic dignity? Thou bid'st creation own his sway, The beasts, the birds his power obey, To him the savage race be tame, The sea her scaly troops resign— Guardian and Governor divine, On earth how excellent thy name! PSALM XV. Lord! who may to thy love aspire, Or hope to join thy heav'nly choir, But he who rests on thee his trust, Whose thoughts are pure, whose actions just, Whose word is truth, whose open heart Disdains the mean disguise of art, Who, swift to praise, as slow to blame, Guards as his own his neighbour's fame. Despising earthly pomp and state, He knows the good alone are great, If Danger wakes, or Justice sleeps, Alike, if given, his word he keeps. No gains luxurious swell his hoard, No guiltless blood embrues his sword, Whom no rewards to vice allure He, walking wisely, walketh sure. PART OF PSALM XVIII. (FROM V. 6 TO V. 11.) Beset with snares, oppress'd by foes, My soul implor'd Jehovah's aid, He heard; and to avenge my cause The rigour of his wrath display'd. Earth trembled at her Maker's ire, Her mountains to their centre shook, His mouth breath'd forth consuming fire, His nostrils, clouds of livid smoke. Downward he rush'd, in flame array'd, He bound the heav'ns, and at his nod Darkness and Night their horrors spread Beneath the footstep of the God. By Cherubs borne, in glory shrined He rode, and mock'd the lightning's pace, On ev'ry wing of ev'ry wind He flew, and fill'd the whole of space. PSALM XLIII. See how, assail'd by Fraud, and Force, Thy suppliant servant lies; With justice arm'd, to check their course, My God, my Guardian rise! Send forth thy Light, thy Truth reveal, And teach my steps to gain The summit of that sacred hill Where shines fair Salem's fane. There at thy altar, placed among Thy consecrated choir, My voice shall pour the sacred song, My hand shall sweep the lyre. When hopes like these, my Soul, are thine Why bear'st thou Sorrow's load? 'Rouse thee! and hail with hymns divine Thy Guardian, and thy God. PSALM LXVII. Far as extend the beams of day Thou, Lord! thy mercy shalt display, That all its saving pow'r may know, And ev'ry tongue with praises flow. Thy statutes learn'd, our pardon seal'd, The wonders of thy grace reveal'd, In every heart thy love shall glow, From ev'ry tongue thy praises flow. Yes, pitying Judge, paternal King, To thee a grateful world shall bring, From ev'ry zone that binds her sphere, A harvest rich of Faith sincere. PSALM LXX. Behold me, Lord, forlorn, distress'd, By Rage pursued, by Power oppress'd, By friends forsaken, foes dismay'd, Divine Redeemer, haste thy aid. From thee, just Arbiter of all! Send forth thy vengeance, and appal The sons of insolence and wrong, Of vengeful heart and taunting tongue. From thee, mild Minister of Grace, Send joy to thy selected race, Who warm'd by rapture from above Shall magnify the name they love. To me, forlorn, distress'd, dismay'd, Send swiftly thy celestial aid, And bid my soul, from sorrows free, Divine Redeemer, haste to thee. PSALM XCIII. Jehovah reigns! his throne sublime, Beyond the bounds of space and time, Is fix'd on its eternal base: Rob'd in majestic state, he reigns, His power this globe of earth sustains, And mid his wonders mark'd its place. Lo, when the floods exalt their waves, When Ocean roars through all his caves He speaks; no more the tempest swells. O first, O universal cause! Eternal Justice fram'd thy laws; Eternal Mercy with thee dwells. PSALM C. Let Earth, through all her realms, rejoice, And ev'ry land and language raise Its loftiest powers of verse and voice, To sound our great Creator's praise. For not from choice or chance we came, But from his all-commanding word, And he that form'd, supports our frame, At once our Shepherd, and our God. Haste then, where'er his temples stand, And through the hallow'd portals throng, There strike the harp with raptur'd hand, There lift the universal song. His truth, his mercy be the theme, Which, unconfined by time or place, Their blessings pour, in endless stream, From age to age, from race to race. A COMPRESSED METRICAL VERSION This title is employed to distinguish this mode of versifying both from literal translation and paraphrase. See Essay on Psalmody, page 182. OF PSALM CIX. I God of my praise, proclaim my wrongs; For well thou know'st this wounded heart Has foster'd those, whose faithless tongues Their rancour at thy servant dart, And load me, while in prayer I mourn, With curses, calumny, and scorn. II Seize him, some impious Judge (they cry) Arraign him, Satan! on his head Let vengeance fall, and instantly Exalt an alien in his stead; While mendicants, and far from home, His widow'd wife and children roam. III Extortion, Rapine, ruthless pair, Be yours to seize his wide domain, Nor lenient Pity drop a tear For him, or for his orphan train: And, 'till oblivion blots his name, Be his to bear his Parent's shame. IV For why? rejoicing to distress, He vex'd the poor, the helpless slew; Eager to curse, yet slow to bless; Let curses then his steps pursue, Like water through his entrails spread, Like oil his every bone pervade. V Be these his vesture, these enclose Each limb, and clinging gird him round, 'Tis thus, great God, my vengeful foes With insults dire thy servant wound: That servant who, on suppliant knee, Father of mercy, mourns to thee. VI O hear, and heal my bleeding heart, Ere, like the locust swept away By sudden storm, I hence depart, Or flitting shade at close of day: For see, through fasting how I pine; How swift my health and strength decline! VII All that behold me, shake in scorn Their head; but thou, benignant Lord, Canst save the wretch howe'er forlorn; Make then my foes thy power record; Prove that their curse can ne'er oppress The Man thy mercy deigns to bless. VIII Cloth'd with confusion, let them fly; While I in grateful hymns prolong Thy praise, and fir'd with holy joy Hail thee, the Sovereign of my song, Whose arm shall save, whose shield secure From wrongs the righteous and the poor. For a defence of this interpretation, see Dr. Sykes's introduction to his paraphrase on the Hebrews.—Mr. Green's translation of the Psalms.—Dr. Lowth and Kennicot, in a note (in loco) to Merrick's Version, though Merrick himself translates it otherwise. See also an Italian Version of Mattei, who follows the interpretation of Marino. —See these proofs collected in the Notes to Mr. Keat's Sermon, preached at Chelsea, April 6th, 1794. July 1795. PSALM CXXI. The hills, the heav'nly hills my eyes With zeal explore, with joy survey, Whence God, who form'd the world and skies, Supports my feet, directs my way. To those who his wise dictates keep, That God, that guardian ne'er will sleep. No: ever wakeful, ever kind, He still will watch his favor'd race, No change of seasons they shall find, For, shaded by his saving grace, No noontide blaze shall scorch their head, No midnight chill infest their bed. Where'er they move, where'er they rest, His smile of mercy, strength of pow'r, Through life, to death, shall shield their breast, And give new blessings every hour; Not time itself his love can bound, It rolls in one eternal round. PSALM CXXVIII. That Man enjoys his Maker's smile, Who humble, just, and good, Contented sees his daily toil Procure him daily food. His Wife, like the prolific vine, With luscious grapes o'erspread, Whose branches o'er his mansion twine, Shall bless his nuptial bed; His Children, like the olives green, Shall bloom his board around, While, at their head, he sits serene, With bliss paternal crown'd. His race, a long progressive train, Through ages shall increase, And, bless'd by Sion's God, remain Possess'd of Israel's peace. PSALM CXXX. Sunk in the deep abyss of woe, To thee, my God! I cry, O, while my contrite tears o'erflow, In pity bend thine eye! For when thy Justice sternly frowns, Who may behold and live? But Mercy mild that Justice crowns, And Mercy must forgive. Thence, with firm faith, and holy fear, All impious doubts withdrawn, I wait thy saving grace to share, As watchmen wait the dawn. That faith, that fear, through Israel spread, Shall dart a cheerful ray, Till full Redemption, o'er his head, Diffuse eternal day. PSALM CXXXVII. (IN ELEGIAC MEASURE.) Captives of Babylon, we sought the vale, Where broad Euphrates rolls in crystal state, Hung our mute harps upon its poplars pale, And sat, dear Sion, weeping o'er thy fate! While our proud victors, in opprobrious vein, Cry'd, Slaves, arise! your silent lyres resume, And swell your voices with that choral strain, Which echo'd sweet in Sion's ruin'd dome! What! to an alien ear, an alien clime, Shall we repeat Jehovah's hallow'd song? Ah! sooner than profane that lay sublime, Cleave to its roots each fibre of our tongue; Forget, my hand, each warbling chord to sweep, So prompt thy modulating powers to own, Or ere my Soul neglects her vows to keep, To sing in Salem's sacred courts alone. O think, great God, on Salem's fatal hour, When hemm'd around by Edom's impious race! They cried, as they beheld each falling tower, “Raze, instant raze it to its central base!” Blest be that future foe, by justice led, Who Israel's woes repeats in Edom's fall, Wreaks all her wrongs on Babylon's proud head, And flings her children 'gainst the shatter'd wall. York, Oct. 26, 1795. PSALM CL Praise be to God, from earth below Where'er his temples rise, Praise in the heav'ns, where Seraphs glow In holy exstacies. His power, his might, his deeds divine, Let sacred verse display, While strings, and pipes, and timbrels join Symphonious to the lay. Fill ye the trumpet's brazen throat, Awake the living lyre, While, pealing with majestic note, The organ leads the choir; Let cymbals clear, in tuneful strife, Their strains with louder raise, And all that breathe the breath of life, Join in Jehovah's praise.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. ELFRIDA; WRITTEN ON THE MODEL OF THE ANCIENT GREEK TRAGEDY. FIRST PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR 1751. THE ARGUMENT. Edgar, King of England, having heard the beauty of Elfrida, daughter of Orgar Earl of Devonshire, highly celebrated, sent his favourite Minister Athelwold to the father's castle, to discover whether she was really so beautiful, as fame reported her to be; and if she was, to offer her his Crown in marriage. Athelwold, on seeing her, fell violently in love with her himself; and married her; conveying her soon after to his own castle in Harewood Forest, where he visited her by stealth from court; and in his absence left her with a train of British Virgins, who form the Chorus. After three months, Orgar, disapproving this confinement of his daughter, came disguised to Harewood to discover the cause of it. His arrival opens the Drama. The incidents which are produced by Athelwold's return from court (who was absent when Orgar came to his castle), and afterwards by the unexpected visit of the king, form the Episode of the Tragedy; the feigned pardon of Athelwold, drawn from the king by the earnest intercession of Elfrida, brings on the Peripetia, or change of fortune; and the single combat between the king and Athelwold, in which the latter is slain, occasions Elfrida to take the vow, which completes the Catastrophe. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Orgar, Earl of Devonshire. Chorus, of British Virgins. Elfrida, Daughter to Orgar. Athelwold, Husband to Elfrida. Edwin, a Messenger. Edgar, King of England. Orgar, disguised in a Peasant's habit, speaks the Prologue. Scene, a Lawn before Athelwold's Castle in Harewood Forest. ORGAR. How nobly does this venerable wood, Gilt with the glories of the orient sun, Embosom yon fair mansion! The soft air Salutes me with most cool and temp'rate breath; And, as I tread, the flow'r-besprinkled lawn Sends up a gale of fragrance. I should guess, If e'er Content deign'd visit mortal clime, This was her place of dearest residence. Grant Heav'n! I find it such. 'Tis now three months, Since first Earl Athelwold espous'd my daughter. He then besought me, for some little space The nuptials might be secret; many reasons, He said, induc'd to this: I made no pause, But, resting on his prudence, to his will Gave absolute concurrence. Soon as married, He to this secret seat convey'd Elfrida; Convey'd her as by stealth, enjoy'd, and left her: Yet not without I know not what excuse Of call to court, of Edgar's royal friendship, And England's welfare. To his prince he went And since, as by intelligence I gather, He oft returns to this his cloister'd wife; But ever with a privacy most studied; Borrowing disguises till inventive art Can scarce supply him with variety. His visits, as they're stol'n, are also short; Seldom beyond the circuit of one sun; Then back to court, while she his absence mourns Full many a lonely hour. I brook not this. Had Athelwold espous'd some base-born peasant, This usage had been apt: but when he took My daughter to his arms, he took a virgin, Through whose rich veins the blood of British kings Ran in unsullied stream. Her lineage sure Might give her place and notice with the noblest In Edgar's court. Elfrida's beauty too (I speak not from a father's foolish fondness) Would shine amid the fairest, and reflect No vulgar glory on that beauty's master. This act bespeaks the madman. Who, that own'd An em'rald, jasper, or rich chrysolite, Would hide its lustre, or not bid it blaze Conspicuous on his brow? Haply Athelwold May have espous'd some other. 'Sdeath! he durst not. My former feats in arms must have inform'd him, That Orgar, while he liv'd, would never prove A traitor to his honour. If he has ? This aged arm is not so much unstrung By slack'ning years, but just revenge will brace it. And, by yon awful heav'n—But hold, my rage. I came to search into this matter coolly. Hence, to conceal the father and the earl, This pilgrim's staff, and scrip, and all these marks Of vagrant poverty. CHORUS (within.) Hail to thy living light, Ambrosial Morn! all hail thy roseate ray! ORGAR. But hark, the sound of sweetest minstrelsy Breaks on mine ear. The females, I suppose, Whom Athelwold has left my child's attendants; That, when she wails the absence of her lord, Their lenient airs, and sprightly-fancied songs, May steal away her woes. See, they approach: This grove shall shroud me till they cease their strain; Then I'll address them with some feigned tale. [He retires. CHORUS. ODE. I. 1. Hail to thy living light, Ambrosial Morn! all hail thy roseate ray: That bids young Nature all her charms display In varied beauty bright; That bids each dewy-spangled flow'ret rise, And dart around its vermil dies; Bids silver lustre grace yon sparkling tide, That winding warbles down the mountain's side. I. 2. Away, ye Goblins all, Wont the bewilder'd traveller to daunt; Whose vagrant feet have trac'd your secret haunt Beside some lonely wall, Or shatter'd ruin of a moss-grown tow'r, Where, at pale midnight's stillest hour, Through each rough chink the solemn orb of night Pours momentary gleams of trembling light. I. 3. Away, ye Elves, away: Shrink at ambrosial Morning's living ray That living ray, whose pow'r benign Unfolds the scene of glory to our eye, Where, thron'd in artless majesty, The cherub Beauty sits on Nature's rustic shrine.— CHORUS, ORGAR. CHORUS. Silence, my sisters. Whence this rudeness, stranger, That thus has prompted thine unbidden ear To listen to our strains? ORGAR. Your pardon, Virgins: I meant not rudeness, though I dar'd to listen; For ah! what ear so fortify'd and barr'd Against the force of powerful harmony, But would with transport to such sweet assailants Surrender its attention? Never yet Have I pass'd by the night-bird's fav'rite spray, What time she pours her wild and artless song, Without attentive pause and silent rapture: How could I then, with savage disregard, Hear voices tun'd by nature sweet as her's, Grac'd with all art's addition? CHORUS. Thy mean garb, And this thy courtly phrase but ill accord. Whence, and what art thou, stranger? ORGAR. Virgins, know These limbs have oft been wrapt in richer vest: But what avails it now? all have their fate; And mine has been most wretched. CHORUS. May we ask What cruel cause— ORGAR. No! let this hapless breast Still hide the melancholy tale. CHORUS. We know, There oft is found an avarice in grief; And the wan eye of Sorrow loves to gaze Upon its secret hoard of treasur'd woes In pining solitude. Perhaps thy mind Takes the same pensive cast: if not, permit That we, in social sympathy, may drop The tender tear. ORGAR. Ah! ill would it become ye, To let the woes of such a wretch as I am, E'er dim your bright eyes with a pitying tear. CHORUS. The eye, that will not weep another's sorrow, Should boast no gentler brightness than the glare, That reddens in the eye-ball of the wolf. Let us intreat— ORGAR. Know, Virgins, I was born To ample property of lands and flocks, On this side Tweeda's stream. My youth and vigour Achiev'd full many a feat of martial prowess: Nor was my skill in chivalry unnoted In the fair volume of my sovereign's love; Who ever held me in his best esteem, And closest to his person. When he paid, What all must pay, to fate; and short-liv'd Edwy Mounted the vacant throne, which now his brother Fills (as loud fame reports) right royally; I then, unfit for pageantry and courts, Sat down in peace among my faithful vassals, At my paternal seat. But ah! not long Had I enjoy'd the sweets of that recess, Ere by the savage inroads of base hinds, That sallied frequent from the Scottish heights, My lands were all laid waste, my people murder'd; And I, through impotence of age unfit To quell their brutal rage, was forc'd to drag My mis'ries through the land, a friendless wand'rer. CHORUS. We pity and condole thy wretched state, But we can do no more; which, on thy part, Claims just returns of pity: for whose lot Demands it more than theirs, whom fate forbids To taste the joys of courteous charity; To wipe the trickling tears, which dew the cheek Of palsied age; to smooth its furrow'd brow, And pay its gray hairs each due reverence? Yet such delight we are forbid to taste! For 'tis our lord's command, that not a stranger, However high or lowly his degree, Have entrance at these gates. ORGAR. Who may this tyrant— CHORUS. Alas! no tyrant he; the more our wonder At this harsh mandate: tenderness and pity Have made his breast their home. He is a man More apt, through inborn gentleness, to err In giving mercy's tide too free a course, Than with a thrifty and illiberal hand To stint its channel. This his praise you'll hear The universal theme in Edgar's court: For Edgar ranks him first in his high favour; Loads him with honours, which the Earl receives, As does the golden censer frankincense, Only to spread a sacred gale of blessings Around on all. ORGAR. Methinks, this pleasing portrait Bears strong resemblance of Lord Athelwold. CHORUS. Himself: no Briton but has heard his fame. ORGAR. 'Tis wond'rous strange; can you conceive no cause For this his conduct? CHORUS. None, that we may trust. ORGAR. Your garbs bespeak you for the fair attendants Of some illustrious dame, the wife, or sister Of this dread Earl. CHORUS. On this head too, old man, We are commanded a religious silence; Which strictly we obey: for well we know Fidelity's a virtue that ennobles Ev'n servitude itself: Farewell, depart With our best wishes; we do trespass much To hold this open converse with a stranger. ORGAR. Stay, Virgins, stay; have ye no friendly shed, But bord'ring on your castle, where these limbs Might lay their load of mis'ry for an hour? Have ye no food, however mean and homely, Wherewith I might support declining nature? Ev'n while I speak, I find my spirits fail; And well, full well, I know, these trembling feet, Ere I can pace a hundred steps, will sink Beneath their wretched burthen. CHORUS. Piteous sight! What shall we do, my sisters? To admit This man beneath the roof, would be to scorn The Earl's strict interdict; and yet my heart Bleeds to behold that white, old, rev'rend head Bow'd with such misery.—Yes, we must aid him. Hie thee, poor Pilgrim, to yon neighb'ring bow'r, O'er which an old oak spreads his awful arm, Mantled in brownest foliage, and beneath The ivy, gadding from th' untwisted stem, Curtains each verdant side. There thou may'st rest; There too, perchance, some of our sisterhood May bring thee speedy sustenance. ORGAR. Kind Heav'n Reward— CHORUS. Good Pilgrim, stay not here to thank us, But haste to give thine age this meet repose. That done, we do conjure thee leave the place With cautious secresy; for was it known, That thus we trespass'd on our lord's command, The consequence were fatal. ORGAR. Fairest Maid! Think not I'll basely draw down punishments On my preservers. I retire. May blessings Show'r'd from yon fount of Bliss repay your kindness. [Exit Orgar. SEMICHORUS. Yes, sisters, yes, when pale distress Implores your aiding hand, Let not a partial faithfulness, Let not a mortal's vain command Urge you to break th' unalterable laws Of heav'n-descended Charity. Ah! follow still the soft-ey'd Deity; For know, each path she draws Along the plain of life, Meets at the central dome of heart-felt joy. Follow the soft-ey'd Deity; She bids ye, as ye hope for blessings, bless. Aid then the gen'ral cause of gen'ral happiness. SEMICHORUS. Humanity, thy awful strain Shall ever greet our ear, Sonorous, sweet, and clear. And as amid the sprightly-swelling train Of dulcet notes, that breathe From flute or lyre, The deep base rolls its manly melody, Guiding the tuneful choir; So thou, Humanity, shalt lead along Th' accordant passions in their moral song, And give our mental concert truest harmony. CHORUS. But see, Elfrida comes. Should we again resume our former strain, And hail the Morn that paints her waking beauties; Or stay her gentle bidding? Rather stay; For, as I think, she seems in pensive mood; And there are times, when to the sorrowing soul Ev'n harmony is harshness. ELFRIDA, CHORUS. ELFRIDA. Oh, my Virgins, With what a leaden and retarding weight Does Expectation load the wing of Time? Alas, how have these three dull hours crept on, Since first the crimson mantle of the morn Skirted yon gay horizon? Say, my friends, Have I miscounted? Did not Athelwold At parting fix this morn for his return? This dear, long-wish'd-for morn? He did, he did, And seal'd it with a kiss; I could not err. And yet he comes not. He was wont outstrip The sun's most early speed, and make its rising To me unwish'd and needless. This delay Creates strange doubts and scruples in my breast. Courts throng with beauties, and my Athelwold Has a soft, susceptible heart, as prone To yield its love to ev'ry sparkling eye, As is the musk-rose to dispense its fragrance To ev'ry whisp'ring breeze; perhaps he's false, Perhaps Elfrida's wretched. CHORUS. See, Elfrida, Ah see! how round yon branching elm the ivy Clasps its green folds, and poisons what supports it. Not less injurious to the shoots of Love Is sickly jealousy. ELFRIDA. My mind nor pines With jealousy, nor rests secure in peace. Who loves, must fear; and sure who loves like me, Must greatly fear. CHORUS. Yet whence the cause? Your Earl Has ever yet (this little breach excepted) Been punctual to appointment. Did his eye Glow with less ardent passion when he left you, Than at the first blest meeting? No! I mark'd him, His parting glance was that of fervent love, And constancy unalter'd. Do not fear him. ELFRIDA. I should not fear him, were his present stay The only cause. Alas, it is not so! Why comes my Earl so secret to these arms? Why, but because he dreads the just reproach Of some deluded fair one! Why am I Here shrouded up, like the pale votarist, Who knows no visitant, save the lone owl, That nightly leaves his ivy-shrouded cell, And sails on slow wing through the cloister'd isles, List'ning her saintly orisons? Why am I Deny'd to follow my departed lord, Whene'er his duty calls him to the palace? CHORUS. Covet not that; the noblest proof of love That Athelwold can give, is still to guard Your beauties from the blast of courtly gales. The crimson blush of virgin modesty, The delicate soft tints of innocence There all fly off, and leave no boast behind But well-rang'd, faded features. Ah, Elfrida, Should you be doom'd, which happier fate forbid! To drag your hours through all that nauseous scene Of pageantry and vice! your purer breast, True to its virtuous relish, soon would heave A fervent sigh for innocence and Harewood. ELFRIDA. You much mistake me, Virgins; the throng'd palace Were undesir'd by me, did not that palace Detain my Athelwold. If he were here, His presence would convert this range of oaks To stately columns; these gay-liv'ried flow'rs To troops of gallant ladies; and yon deer, That jut their antlers forth in sportive fray, To armed knights at joust or tournament. If Athelwold dwelt here; if no ambition Could lure his steps from love, and this still forest; If I might never moan his time of absence, Longer than that which serv'd him for the chase Or of the wolf, or stag; or when he bore The hood-wink'd falcon forth; might these, my Virgins, And these alone, be love's short intervals, I should not have one thought remote from Harewood. CHORUS. And would you wish that Athelwold should slight The weal of England, and on these light toys Waste his unvalued hours? No, fond Elfrida; His active soul is wing'd for nobler flights. ELFRIDA. What then, must England's welfare hold my Earl For ever from these shades? CHORUS. We say not that. The youth, who bathes in pleasure's tempting stream At well judg'd intervals, feels all his soul Nerv'd with recruited strength; but if too oft He swims in sportive mazes through the flood, It chills his languid virtue. For this cause Your Earl forbids, that these enchanting groves, And their fair mistress should possess him wholly. He knows he has a country and a king, That claim his first attention; yet be sure, 'Twill not be long, ere his unbending mind Shall lose in sweet oblivion ev'ry care, Among th' embow'ring shades that veil Elfrida. ELFRIDA. Oh be that speech prophetic; may he soon Seek these embow'ring shades! Meanwhile, my friends, Sooth me with harmony. I know full well That ye were nurs'd in Cornwall's wizard caves, And oft have pac'd the fairy-peopled vales Of Devon, where posterity retains Some vein of that old minstrelsy, which breath'd Through each time-honour'd grove of British oak. There, where the spreading consecrated boughs Fed the sage misletoe, the holy Druids Lay rapt in moral musings; while the Bards Call'd from their solemn harps such lofty airs, As drew down Fancy from the realms of light To paint some radiant vision on their minds, Of high mysterious import. But on me Such strains sublime were wasted: I but ask A sprightly song to speed the lazy flight Of these dull hours. And music sure can find A magic spell to make them skim their round, Swift as the swallow circles. Try its power: While I, from yonder hillock, watch his coming. [Exit Elfrida. CHORUS. ODE. I. 1. The turtle tells her plaintive tale, Sequester'd in some shadowy vale; The lark in radiant ether floats, And swells his wild extatic notes: Meanwhile on yonder hawthorn spray The linnet wakes her temp'rate lay; She haunts no solitary shade, She flutters o'er no sun-shine mead, No love-lorn griefs depress her song, No raptures lift it loudly high, But soft she trills, amid th' aerial throng, Smooth simple strains of sob'rest harmony. I. 2. Sweet bird! like thine our lay shall flow, Nor gaily brisk, nor sadly slow; For to thy note sedate, and clear, Content still lends a list'ning ear. Reclin'd this mossy bank along, Oft has she heard thy careless song: Why hears not now? What fairer grove From Harewood lures her devious love? What fairer grove than Harewood knows More woodland walks, more fragrant gales, More shadowy bowers, inviting soft repose, More streams slow-wand'ring thro' her winding vales? I. 3. Perhaps to some lone cave the rover flies, Where lull'd in pious peace the hermit lies. For, from the hall's tumultuous state, Where banners wave with blazon'd gold, There will the meek-ey'd matron oft retreat, And with the solemn sage high converse hold. II. 1. There, goddess, on the shaggy mound, Where tumbling torrents roar around, Where pendant mountains o'er your head Stretch their reverential shade, You listen, while the holy Seer Slowly chants his vespers clear; Or of his sparing mess partake, The sav'ry pulse, the wheaten cake, The bev'rage cool of limpid rill. Then, rising light, your host you bless, And o'er his saintly temples bland distil Seraphic day-dreams of heav'n's happiness. II. 2. Where'er thou art, enchanting Power, Thou soon wilt smile in Harewood's bower: Soon will thy fairy feet be seen, Printing this dew-impearled green; Soon shall we mark thy gestures meek, Thy glitt'ring eye and dimpled cheek, Among the welcome guests that move Attendant on the state of Love. There, when the Sov'reign leads along Of sports and smiles a jocund train, Then last but loveliest of the lovely throng, Thou com'st to soften, yet secure his reign. II. 3. And, hark, completing our prophetic lay, The fleet hoof rattles o'er the flinty way; Now nearer, and now nearer sounds. Avaunt! ye vain, delusive fears. Hark! Echo tells through Harewood's amplest bounds, That Love, Content, and Athelwold appears. ATHELWOLD, ELFRIDA, CHORUS. ATHELWOLD. Look ever thus; with that bright glance of joy Thus always meet my transports. Let these arms Thus ever fold me; and this cheek, that blooms With all health's op'ning roses, press my lips, Warm as at this blest moment. ELFRIDA. Athelwold, I had prepar'd me many a stern rebuke; Had arm'd my brow with frowns, and taught my eye Th' averted glance of coldness, which might best Greet such a loit'ring lover: but I find, 'Twas a vain task; for this my truant heart Forgets each lesson, which resentment taught, And in thy sight knows only to be happy. ATHELWOLD. My best Elfrida—Heav'ns! it cannot last. The giddy height of joy, to which I'm lifted, Is as a hanging rock, at whose low foot The black and beating surge of infamy Rolls ready to receive, and sink my soul. ELFRIDA. So soon to fall into this musing mood— I thought, my Lord, you promis'd you would leave These looks behind at Court. Nay, 'twas the cause Assign'd for this my residence at Harewood, That you might never come to these fond arms, But with a breast devoid of public care, And fill'd alone with rapture and Elfrida. Said you not so? Why then that pensive posture, That down-cast eye? Surely the City's din, And this calm grove have lost their difference. I'll with you to the palace. ATHELWOLD. Heav'n forbid! ELFRIDA. Nay, my best Lord, I meant it but in sport; For should you bid me quit these blooming lawns, For some bare heath, or drear unpeopled desert; Believe me, I would think its wildness Eden, If Athelwold with frequent visitation Endear'd the savage scene; but yet I fear My Father. ATHELWOLD. Hah! why him? ELFRIDA. You know his temper; How jealous of his rank, and his trac'd lineage From royal ancestry. I fear me much, He will not brook you should conceal me long In this lone privacy: No, he will deem it Far unbecoming her, whose veins are fill'd With the rich stream of his nobility. Should it be so, his hot and fiery nature, I doubt, will blaze, and do some dreadful outrage. ATHELWOLD. He need not know it, or, if chance he should, It matters not, if so this forest life Seem of your own adoption and free choice. And that it will so seem, I trust that love, Which ever yet has met my wayward will With pleas'd compliance, and unask'd assent. ELFRIDA. And ever shall: yet blame me not, my Lord, If prying womanhood should prompt a wish To learn the cause of this your strange commotion, Which ever wakes, if I but drop one thought Of quitting Harewood. ATHELWOLD. Go to the clear surface Of yon unruffled lake, and, bending o'er it, There read my answer. ELFRIDA. These are riddles, Sir— ATHELWOLD. No; for its glassy and reflecting surface Will smile with charms too tempting for a palace. ELFRIDA. Does Athelwold distrust Elfrida's faith? ATHELWOLD. No; but he much distrusts Elfrida's beauty. ELFRIDA. Away: you trifle. ATHELWOLD. Never more in earnest; I would not for the throne which Edgar sits on, That Edgar should behold it. ELFRIDA. What, my Lord! Think you the form, that caught your single heart, Will make all hearts its captives? Vain surmize. Yet grant it could? the form is your's alone: Not Edgar's self would dare to seize it from you. Edgar's a King, and not a tyrant. ATHELWOLD. True; Edgar's a King, a just one; his firm feet Walk ever in the fore-right road of honour: Nor do I know what lure can draw his steps Devious from that straight path, save only one: That tempting lure is beauty. Ah! Elfrida, Throw but the dazzling bait within his view, The untam'd wolf does not with fiercer rage Burst the slight bondage of the silken net, Than he the ties of law. Late, very late, Smit casually with young Matilda's face, He straight commanded her reluctant Mother To yield her to his arms; nor had she 'scap'd The violating fervour of his love, Had not the prudent dame suborn'd her handmaid To take the unchaste office, and be led, Veil'd in the mask of night, to Edgar's chamber, A counterfeit Matilda. As it chanc'd, The damsel pleas'd the King, nor did detection A whit abate his fondness; he forgave The prudent mother, eas'd Matilda's fears, And led the wanton minstrel to his court, Where still she shares— CHORUS. Behold, Earl Athelwold, A messenger arrives; his speed and aspect Speak some important errand. EDWIN, ATHELWOLD, ELFRIDA, CHORUS. ATHELWOLD. How now, Edwin? EDWIN. The King, my Lord, is on his way to Harewood. ATHELWOLD. The King! EDWIN. His purpose is to pass through Mercia: And in a hasty message, some two hours After you left the palace, this his pleasure Was sent you by Lord Seofrid: withal Commanding your attendance. You being absent, He straightway turn'd his course through this fair forest, Meaning to chace the Stag; his train is small, As was his purpose sudden. ELFRIDA. Good my Lord, Why thus perplex'd! CHORUS. Heav'ns! what a deep despair Sits on his brow! ELFRIDA. The notice sure is short; But that's a trifle, a small train requires The smaller preparation: let him come. ATHELWOLD. Yes, let him come: so thou wilt say, Elfrida, When thou hast heard my tale. Yes, let him come; So wilt thou say, and let thy husband perish. Yet shall these arms once more embrace thee closely, Ere yet thou fly them as the pois'nous adder. 'Tis o'er: in that embrace Elfrida's love Was buried; and in that embrace, the peace Of wretched Athelwold. ELFRIDA. What may this be! ATHELWOLD. Oh Edwin, Edwin, when surviving malice Shall prey upon the fame of thy dead master, Wilt thou not some way strive to check the fiend's Insatiate fury? wilt thou see my name Defil'd and blacken'd with detraction's venom, And bear it patiently? ELFRIDA. What means my best— ATHELWOLD. Peace; not a word of best, or lov'd, or dear: Such tender terms are not for thee to use, Or me to triumph in. Virgins, retire; We would a while be private. Nay, return. Concealment would be vain; and ye and Edwin Are bound to me. Albina! as for you, I sav'd your father, when his blood was forfeit. CHORUS. Not I, great Earl, alone, but all this train Are bound by ev'ry tie of faith and love To gen'rous Athelwold; to that mild master, Who never forc'd our service to one act, But of such liberal sort, as freedom's self Would smilingly perform. ATHELWOLD. It may be so; But where's the tie, Elfrida, that may bind Thy faith and love? ELFRIDA. The strongest sure, my Lord, The golden, nuptial tie. Try but its strength. ATHELWOLD. I must perforce this instant. Know, Elfrida, Once, on a day of high festivity, The youthful King, encircled with his Nobles, Crown'd high the sparkling bowl; and much of love, Of beauty much the sprightly converse ran. When, as it well might chance, the brisk Lord Ardulph Made gallant note of Orgar's peerless daughter, And in such phrase as might enflame a breast More cool than Edgar's. Early on the morrow Th' impatient Monarch gave me swift commission To view those charms, of which Lord Ardulph's tongue Had giv'n such warm description: to whose words If my impartial eye gave full assent, I had his royal mandate on the instant To hail thee Queen of England. ELFRIDA, 'Stead of which, You came, and hail'd me wife of Athelwold. Was this the tale I was so taught to fear? Was this the deed, that known would make me fly Thy clasping arm, as 'twere the pois'nous adder; See, I again embrace thee; dearest proof That thy Elfrida's love can never die; Or, if it could, that this embrace revives it. ATHELWOLD. Dost thou then pardon me? Come, injur'd sov'reign, Plunge deep thy sword of justice in this breast, And I will die contented. ELFRIDA. Heav'n forbid! What can be done? CHORUS. Indeed, ye constant pair, 'Tis fit ye strive to fly the coming danger: For safety now sits wav'ring on your love, Like the light down upon the thistle's beard, Which ev'ry breeze may part. Say, noble Earl, What feint was us'd to lull the king's impatience? ATHELWOLD. Soon as these shades had veil'd my beauteous bride I hasted back to Edgar, laugh'd at Ardulph, And talk'd of Elfrid, as of vulgar beauties; Own'd no uncommon light'ning in her eye, No breast that sham'd the snow, or cheek the rose, The sprightly King believ'd me, and forgot her. CHORUS. But an alliance, great as Athelwold's With Orgar's daughter, soon would blaze abroad, The theme of popular converse. ATHELWOLD. True, it would, And for that reason, when I last was here, The King was taught I went to wed Elfrida. ELFRIDA. How so, my lord? ATHELWOLD. Thy father, my Elfrida, Has rich possessions: these, and these alone, I made my theme of love: and told the king, That though thy face (pardon the impious falshood) Boasted not charms to grace a Monarch's throne, Yet would thy dow'r well suit his minister. I therefore meant to ask thee of thy father, And (that my want of skill in choice might 'scape All censure) hide thee close in Harewood castle. Edgar with smiles consented, and, I think, Harbours no thought of my disloyalty. ELFRIDA. If so, what danger now? ATHELWOLD. Ask'st thou, what danger? Heav'ns! will that glance not instantly proclaim My tenfold perfidy? ELFRIDA. He shall not see me. I'll hide me instant in some secret chamber, And robe this virgin in my bridal vestments. ATHELWOLD. Thy love, like balm, runs trickling o'er the wounds Of my torn bosom; yet 'tis vain, 'tis vain: Thou must thyself appear, for Ardulph ever Attends the King, and would detect the fraud. ELFRIDA. If so, yet still I can assure our safety; For as you fear my softness of complexion, I'll stain it with the juice of dusky leaves, Or yellow berries, which this various wood From tree or shrub will yield me. These I'll use, And form a thousand methods to conceal The little gleams of grace, which Nature lent me. Fear not my caution. ATHELWOLD. Gentlest, best of creatures, Go, do then as thy tender care directs. And yet how vain! What wond'rous art can steal The liquid lightnings from those radiant eyes, Or rob the wavy ringlets of that hair Of all their nameless graces? Say it could, Yet would that modest, but majestic mien, That inborn dignity of soul, which breathes Through each angelic gesture, still remain To seize the heart of Edgar. Rest, Elfrida, Rest as thou art, in all that blaze of beauty: I must submit to my just lot, and lose thee. ELFRIDA. Away, my Lord, with these too anxious scruples: Fear not my carriage; I will stoop my head, Drawl out an idiot phrase, and do each act With ev'n a rude and peasant awkwardness. EDWIN. Ere this, my Lord, I think, the King has reach'd The full mid-way; 'twere fit you stood prepar'd To give him meeting. ATHELWOLD. Give him meeting, Edwin! Alas! I have no mask to veil my baseness. When deep contrition shadows all my soul, I cannot dress my features in light smiles, And look the thing I am not. No, these eyes Are not as yet true vassals to my purpose; As yet indeed I am but half a villain. ELFRIDA. You weigh this matter in too nice a balance. Your crime, my Lord, is but the crime of love: Thousands like you have fail'd. ATHELWOLD. I know, Elfrida, Could love absolve the crime, my soul were pure As maiden innocence. Yes, I do love thee, And thou art fair—beyond—But that's my bane; Thy ev'ry charm adds weight to my offence, And heaps fresh wrongs upon the best of masters. Yes, Elfrid, Edgar was the best of masters. Oh hide me from the thought in that dear bosom— Heav'ns! I must die or keep her. ELFRIDA. Live, or die, I'm thine alike. Death cannot aught abate, Or life augment, my love. Let this embrace Be witness of my truth. ATHELWOLD. It shall, it shall: Thy ev'ry word and look declares thee faithful: Secure of all thy love, and all thy prudence, Returning confidence has arm'd my soul For this dread meeting: resting on thy truth I go— [Exit Athelwold. ELFRIDA. Go, and thy guardian saint preserve thee, Show'r blessings vast as would my lavish love, Had I his power to bless thee! CHORUS. Yes, my Sisters, The silent awe that reigns through all your train, Befits ye well. Let admiration first Pay her mute tribute. She can best express, By those her kindling cheeks, and lifted eyes Where the tear twinkles, that transcendent praise Elfrida's virtue claims. ELFRIDA. My virtue, Virgins, Is only love. Or, say that it be virtue, It owes its source to love, to chastest love, Than which what passion more impels the mind To fair and gen'rous action? But the hours Are precious now. I'll to yon neighb'ring grove: There grows an azure flow'r, I oft have mark'd it, Which stains the pressing finger with a juice Of dusky, yellow tinct: Its name I know not, I'll fetch and try it straight. Wait my return. [Exit Elfrida. CHORUS. ODE. I. Whence does this sudden lustre rise, That gilds the grove? Not like the noontide beam, Which sparkling dances on the trembling stream, Nor the blue lightning's flash swift-shooting thro' the skies. But such a solemn steady light, As o'er the cloudless azure steals, When Cynthia, riding on the brow of night, Stops in their mid career her silver wheels. II. Whence can it rise, but from the sober power Of Constancy? She, heav'n-born queen, Descends, and here in Harewood's hallow'd bower, Fixes her stedfast reign: Stedfast, as when her high command Gives to the starry band Their radiant stations in heav'n's ample plain. Stedfast, as when around this nether sphere, She winds the various year; Tells what time the snow-drop cold Its maiden whiteness may unfold, When the golden harvest bend, When the ruddy fruits descend. Then bids pale Winter wake, to pour The pearly hail's translucent show'r, To cast his silv'ry mantle o'er the woods, And bind in crystal chains the slumb'ring floods. III. The soul, which she inspires, has pow'r to climb To all the heights sublime Of Virtue's tow'ring hill. That hill, at whose low foot weak-warbling strays The scanty stream of human praise, A shallow trickling rill. While on the summits hov'ring angels shed, From their blest pinions, the nectareous dews Of rich immortal fame: From these the Muse Oft steals some precious drops, and skilful blends With those the lower fountain lends; Then show'rs it all on some high-favour'd head. But thou, Elfrida, claim'st the genuine dew; Thy worth demands it all, Pure, and unmixt, on thee the holy drops shall fall. [Elfrida returns with flowers. ELFRIDA, ORGAR, CHORUS. ELFRIDA (looking on the flower). 'Tis strange, my Virgins, this sweet child of summer, Silken and soft, whose breath perfumes the air, Whose gay vest paints the morn, should in its bosom Hide such pollution? Yet 'tis often thus: All are not as they seem. ORGAR. Yet hear me, Lady. ELFRIDA. Be gone, unmanner'd stranger, nor pursue me; Hence, from the grove. Know ye this Pilgrim, Virgins? On my return I met him here. CHORUS. Alas! We saw him here before, and heard his tale, That mov'd our pity—But I fear me now, 'Twas false; some spy, perchance, and may have heard— ORGAR. I have; yet not for that are you betray'd. Fair excellence, my heart is bound unto you, I feel a tender interest in your welfare, Tender as fathers feel. ELFRIDA. As fathers feel! That well known voice, and ah! that look— ORGAR. Elfrida! ELFRIDA. Yes, it is he, it is my Father: Virgins, Support me, or I faint! Oh, wherefore, Sir? ORGAR. Take courage, Daughter; my parental fondness Prompted this visit. Thus I came disguis'd, To learn the cause of my dear child's confinement: And I have learnt it. ELFRIDA. Then all's lost for ever. ORGAR. Thou know'st, Elfrida, next my house's honour, Thy peace has ever been my dearest care. But such an insult—No: I cannot brook it. So black a fraud! By all my ancestors, By Belin's shade I will have ample vengeance. ELFRIDA. Alas! I know too well your dreadful purpose. I knew it at the first. Yes, he must fall. Yet pardon me, if my poor trembling heart Puts up I know not what of pray'rs and vows To ev'ry pitying saint. Celestial Guardians Of nuptial constancy! Oh bend from heav'n Your star-crown'd heads, and hear a wretched woman, That begs ye save, from a dread father's rage, Her lord, her husband. ORGAR. Husband! Sooner call Th' impeached thief true master of the booty He stole, or murder'd for. Disdain the villain; And help me to revenge thee. CHORUS. Think, great Earl; What sanctimonious ties restrain your daughter. Did she not swear before the hallow'd shrine Eternal fealty to this her lord? Yet say, that he deceiv'd her; shall her truth Dare to revenge? No, Sir, in highest heav'n Vengeance in storms and tempests sits enshrin'd, Vested in robes of lightning, and there sleeps, Unwak'd but by the incens'd Almighty's call. Oh! let not man presume to take unbid That dread vicegerency. ORGAR. Peace, Virgins, peace. Not ev'n the saws of Druids or of Bards Have weight with me, when insults high as this Rouse my just indignation. Hear me, Daughter; You went to search for flow'rs, to blot your charms With their dun hue. Yes, thou shalt search for flow'rs, Yet shall they be the loveliest of the spring; Flow'rs, that entangling in thine auburn hair, Or blushing 'mid the whiteness of thy bosom, May, to the power of ev'ry native grace, Give double life and lustre. Haste, my child, Array thyself in thy most gorgeous garb, And see each jewel, which my love procur'd thee, Dart its full radiance. More than all, put on The nobler ornament of winning smiles, And kind inviting glances. ELFRIDA. Never, never; When this true heart renounces Athelwold, May equitable Heav'n— ORGAR. Away with vows; And with a duteous, and attentive ear, Listen to my persuasions. Much I wish Persuasions might prevail, that not compell'd To use a father's just prerogative, My will may meet with thy unforc'd obedience. Follow me, on thy duty. ELFRIDA. Cruel Father, That duty shall obey you; I will follow: Yet dread as is that frown, dreadful as death, It shall not shake the tenor of my faith; Living or dead I still am Athelwold's. [Exeunt Orgar and Elfrida. SEMICHORUS. Horror! Horror! The pen of fate, dipt in its deepest gall, Perhaps on that ill-omen'd wall, Now writes th' event of this tremendous day. Oh! that our weaker sight Could read the mystic characters, and spy What to the unpurg'd, mortal eye, Is hid in endless night. SEMICHORUS. Suspense! thou frozen guest, begone. The wretch, whose rugged bed Is spread on thorns, more softly rests his head, Than he that sinks amid the cygnet's down, If thou, tormenting fiend, be nigh, To prompt his starting tear, his ceaseless sigh, His wish, his pray'r, his vow for ling'ring certainty. CHORUS. But hark! that certainty arrives. Methought I heard the winding horn. I did not err; The King is near at hand. This quick approach Will sure prevent this proud Earl's cruel purpose. Yet what of that? Does her fair form require The blazon of rich vesture? Genuine beauty Nor asks, nor needs it: Negligence alone Is its bright diadem, and artless ease Its robe of Tyrian tincture. Say, my Sisters, Shall we salute this monarch with a hymn Of festival and joy? Alas! such joy Ill suits our trembling hearts, and weeping eyes. And now 'twere vain; for see, the King approaches. EDGAR, ATHELWOLD, CHORUS. EDGAR. No, Athelwold; not from a partial blindness, Or for the mode and guise of courtesy, Are we thus large in praise; in our true judgment, This castle is not more kind Nature's debtor For its delicious site, than 'tis to thee For this so goodly structure. From its base, Ev'n to yon turrets trim, and taper spires, All is of choicest masonry. Each part Doth boast a separate grace, yet each combines To form one graceful whole; for ornament, Though here the richest that the eye can note, Is us'd, not lavish'd; Art seems generous here, Yet not a prodigal. But ah! my Earl, [Seeing the Chorus. What living charms are here? Thy castle's beauty Must not detain me from this lovelier prospect. Your pardon, fair ones, that my wayward eye Paid not at first, where first was surely due, Its homage to your graces. ATHELWOLD. Heav'ns! they weep. What may this mean? Some dread and unseen chance Has counter-work'd my safety. EDGAR. Whence this silence? Why are your lovely heads thus bow'd with sadness? Beshrew my heart, my Lord, but this is strange. I know thee, Earl, and know thy gentleness, More prone t' obey, than lord it o'er the sex; Else should I guess this sorrow had its rise From some discourteous treatment. CHORUS. No, dread Sov'reign; He is the noblest, gentlest, best of masters; And may your love reward— ORGAR, ATHELWOLD, EDGAR, CHORUS. ATHELWOLD. Death to my hopes! ORGAR. Yes, Villain, start; but let this vengeful arm Arrest thy baseness: would to Heav'n its strength, Thus grasping thee, could open thy false breast, And bare thy heart to the sham'd eye of day. EDGAR. Patience, hot man. What art thou? ORGAR. Earl of Devon. Pardon me, Prince; that this my honest rage O'erleaps obedient duty. I am wrong'd, Yet that's but small; for know, much-injur'd Prince, Thy wrongs as well as mine both call for justice. Yes, Sir, I here, on a true subject's oath, Proclaim Earl Athelwold a faithless traitor. EDGAR. Ha! what is this? Renounce the word, old Earl; Thy length of years hath forc'd thee, sure, to press The verge of dotage. Athelwold! what, Athelwold A faithless traitor! Perish the suspicion. Never before did word, or thought, or look Give doubt of his distinguish'd loyalty: Dotage alone could frame the accusation. ORGAR. I do not dote; thank Heav'n, my faculties Are yet my own, unblemish'd and unhurt. Would so my Daughter were! EDGAR. What is his drift? ATHELWOLD. Better, my royal Lord, you mark'd him not; The wayward Earl is— ORGAR. What, audacious Villain! I will be heard. EDGAR, Go to, thou choleric Lord! ORGAR. When thou hast heard me, Edgar, call me choleric. EDGAR. Speak then, and briefly. ORGAR. Once, my sacred Liege, I had a daughter, duteous as e'er crown'd A father's wish, and lovely as could warm A youth to am'rous transports. This, my Lord, You learnt long since from noble Ardulph's praises. And, fir'd with his description, sent this Earl, This faithful Earl, t'invite her to your throne. EDGAR. No, Orgar, not t'invite her to our throne; Simply to note her beauty was his errand. ORGAR. Yes, he did note it, stampt it for his own. But why this parley? Enter, Sir, these gates, And let Elfrida's features be the book, Where you may read the story of his falshood, Ev'n on the instant. EDGAR. Noble Lord, lead on: We'll follow to the trial. I will humour The Earl's hot temper. He has heard my friend, We meant t'exalt his daughter, and for that His partial fondness, link'd with his ambition, Levels this rage at thee. Attend us, Lords. [Exeunt Edgar, Orgar, &amp;c. CHORUS, ATHELWOLD. CHORUS. My Lord, the King is enter'd: stand not thus In mute and fixt distress. ATHELWOLD. Away, away; What! can a man that thinks such thoughts as I do Have pow'r of word or motion? speak to me; Inform me all. What said she, when I left her? How came her Father hither? how did she Greet his arrival? say, was she compell'd, Or did her free and voluntary voice Tell all the story? Did she marshal him To this his deed of vengeance; CHORUS. Dearest Master; Elfrida told him not: his own deceit Was his informer. Here the Earl arriv'd Early at morn, in mean and pilgrim weeds, All like an ancient, toil-worn traveller; And with a tale, told in such piteous strain, Fraught with such sad and moving circumstance, With woes so well dissembled, that our softness Suffer'd him enter this close bow'r for rest, Which he adapting to his prying purpose, Thence learnt the secret. This our disobedience, We own— ATHELWOLD. Was my perdition. Yet 'tis well; I blame ye not; it was Heav'n's justice, Virgins; This brought him hither; this annull'd your faith. I do not think, you purpos'd my destruction; But yet you have destroy'd me. Oh Elfrida, And art thou faithful? This my jealous eye Thought it had mark'd some speck of change upon thee; Thought it had found, what might have made thy loss Somewhat within endurance. 'Tis not so; And this thy purity but serves t' augment The sum of my distractions. Meet me, Edgar, With thy rais'd sword: be merciful and sudden— [Exit Athelwold. CHORUS. ODE. I. 1. Say, will no white-rob'd Son of Light, Swift-darting from his heav'nly height, Here deign to take his hallow'd stand; Here wave his amber locks; unfold His pinions cloth'd with downy gold; Here smiling stretch his tutelary wand? And you, ye host of Saints, for ye have known Each dreary path in life's perplexing maze, Though now ye circle yon eternal throne With harpings high of inexpressive praise, Will not your train descend in radiant state, To break with Mercy's beam this gath'ring cloud of Fate? I. 2. 'Tis silence all. No Son of Light Darts swiftly from his heav'nly height; No train of radiant Saints descend. “Mortals, in vain ye hope to find, “If guilt, if fraud has stain'd your mind, “Or Saint to hear, or Angel to defend.” So Truth proclaims. I hear the sacred sound Burst from the centre of her burning throne; Where aye she sits with star-wreath'd lustre crown'd: A bright sun clasps her adamantine zone. So Truth proclaims: her awful voice I hear: With many a solemn pause it slowly meets my ear. I. 3. “Attend, ye sons of men; attend, and say, “Does not enough of my refulgent ray “Break through the veil of your mortality! “Say, does not reason in this form descry “Unnumber'd, nameless glories, that surpass “The Angel's floating pomp, the Seraph's glowing grace? II. 1. “Shall then your earth-born daughters vie “With me? Shall she, whose brightest eye “But emulates the diamond's blaze, “Whose cheek but mocks the peaches' bloom, “Whose breath the hyacinth's perfume, “Whose melting voice the warbling woodlark's lays, “Shall she be deem'd my rival? Shall a form “Of elemental dross, of mould'ring clay, “Vie with these charms imperial? The poor worm “Shall prove her contest vain. Life's little day “Shall pass, and she is gone: while I appear “Flush'd with the bloom of youth thro' Heav'n's eternal year. II. 2. “Know, Mortals, know, ere first ye sprung, “Ere first these orbs in ether hung, “I shone amid the heav'nly throng. “These eyes beheld Creation's day, “This voice began the choral lay, “And taught Archangels their triumphant song. “Pleas'd I survey'd bright Nature's gradual birth, “Saw infant Light with kindling lustre spread, “Soft vernal fragrance clothe the flow'ring earth, “And Ocean heave on his extended bed; “Saw the tall pine aspiring pierce the sky, “The tawny lion stalk, the rapid eagle fly. II. 3. “Last, Man arose, erect in youthful grace, “Heav'n's hallow'd image stampt upon his face, “And, as he rose, the high behest was giv'n, “That I alone, of all the host of heav'n, “Should reign Protectress of the godlike youth. “Thus the Almighty spake: he spake, and call'd me Truth.” ATHELWOLD, EDWIN, CHORUS. ATHELWOLD. Banish me! No. I'll die. For why should life Remain a lonely lodger in that breast Which honour leaves deserted? Idle breath, Thou can'st not fill such vacancy. Begone. This sword shall free— CHORUS. Oh shame to Fortitude! Shame to that manly passion, which inspires Its vigorous warmth, when the bleak blasts of Fate Would chill the soul. Oh call the ready virtue Quick to thy aid, for she is ever near thee; Is ever prompt to spread her sevenfold shield O'er noble breasts. ATHELWOLD. And but o'er noble breasts; Not o'er the breast which livid infamy Indelibly has spotted. Oh shame, shame! Sword, rid me of the thought. CHORUS. Forbear, forbear; Think what a sea of deep perdition whelms The wretch's trembling soul, who launches forth Unlicens'd to eternity. Think, think; And let the thought restrain thy impious hand. The race of man is one vast marshall'd army, Summon'd to pass the spacious realms of time; Their leader the Almighty. In that march Ah who may quit his post, when high in air The chos'n Archangel rides, whose right hand wields Th' imperial standard of Heav'n's providence, Which, dreadly sweeping through the vaulted sky, O'ershadows all creation? ATHELWOLD. I was once— Yes, I was once (I have his royal word for 't) A man of such try'd faith, such steady honour, As mock'd all doubt and scruple.—What a change! Now must that unstain'd, virgin character, Be doom'd to gross and hourly prostitution, Sating the lust of slander; and my wife, My chaste Elfrida—Oh distraction! no, I'll fly to save her. EDWIN. Stay, my dearest Master; You rush on instant death. ATHELWOLD. I mean it, Slave, And would'st thou hinder me? EDWIN. Yes, Sir, I hold 'Tis duty to my King, and love to you, Thus to oppose your entrance. ATHELWOLD. What, thou Traitor! Thy pardon, Edwin, I forgot myself; Forgot, that I stood here a banish'd man; And that this gate was shut against its master. And yet this gate leads to my dear Elfrida; Can it be barr'd to me? Oh earth, cold earth, Upon whose breast I cast this load of mis'ry, Bear it a while; and you, ye aged oaks, Ye venerable fathers of this wood, Who oft have cool'd beneath your arching shades My humble ancestors, oft seen them hie To your spread umbrage, from yon sultry field, Their scene of honest labour, shade, ah! shade The last, the wretchedest of all their race. I will not long pollute ye; for I mean To pay beneath your consecrated gloom A sacrifice to honour, and the ghosts Of those progenitors, who sternly frown On me their base descendant. EDWIN. See, ye Virgins, How horror shades his brow; how fixt his eye; Heav'ns! what despair— CHORUS. Edwin, 'tis ever thus With noble minds, if chance they slide to folly; Remorse stings deeper, and relentless conscience Pours more of gall into the bitter cup Of their severe repentance. ATHELWOLD. 'Tis resolved; I'll enter and demand a second audience. And yet how vain! ere I can reach his ear, His ready train will stop me, and, with all The cruel punctuality of office, So prompt to act against fall'n favourites, Dismiss me with reproof.—Surely I heard her. Was't not Elfrida's voice? 'Tis she herself. ELFRIDA, EDGAR, ATHELWOLD, ORGAR, CHORUS. ELFRIDA. No, I will once more clasp him to my bosom, I will not be withheld, I will o'ertake him, Will go with him to exile. Hah, my Husband! So quickly found? they thought to tear me from thee; But we will part no more. EDGAR. Take heed, Elfrida. This ill-tim'd fondness may recall the fate I just now freed him from; who loves like me Can ill brook this. Or quit him, or he dies. ATHELWOLD. Yes, let me die! death is my dearest wish. Quit me, Elfrida! leave me to my fate. 'Tis just, 'tis just. Thus to my Sov'reign's sword Freely I bare my breast. Strike, injur'd Prince; But do not banish me. ELFRIDA. What, Athelwold, Is then the life, on whose dear preservation Elfrida's peace depends, not worth the saving! Die then. But ere thy murd'rer strike the stroke, Let me inform him, that his act destroys No single life. EDGAR. By Heav'n, she loves the traitor Beyond all hope of change— ELFRIDA. No, Athelwold, Thou shalt not die: That pause in royal Edgar Bespeaks forgiveness. He will soon relent; And mercy, flowing from his gracious tongue, Seal thy full pardon. Let us kneel, my Lord; Seize the important moment; kneel together, And as these streaming eyes and lifted hands Employ each act of silent supplication, Do thou recount—Ah! no, thy modest tongue Could never tell ev'n half the gallant story. Be silent then. Let Edgar's self reflect; For well I know his mem'ry writes thy virtues Upon its fairest page. Yes, let him weigh All thy past deeds of loyalty and faith, 'Gainst this so light a fault. EDGAR. So light a fault! Had he dislodg'd my richest coffer'd treasures, Dispers'd sedition's poison 'mid my troops, Or aim'd with daring and rebellious hand To snatch these regal honours from my brow, I sooner could have pardon'd. ATHELWOLD. Cease, Elfrida, My doom is just—Yes, royal Sir, I go To banishment. I do deserve to breathe, Deserve to bear this load of life about me, For many years; to lengthen out my age, List'ning the hourly knell of curst Remembrance, Whose leaden stroke shall tell to my sad soul That I was faithful once. ELFRIDA. Oh flinty Edgar, What! will this penitence not move thee? Know There is a rose-lip'd Seraph sits on high, Who ever bends his holy ear to earth To mark the voice of Penitence, to catch Her solemn sighs, to tune them to his harp, And echo them in harmonies divine Up to the throne of Grace. Ev'n Heav'n is won By penitence, and shall Heav'n's substitute, Shall Edgar scorn— EDGAR. Cease, cease, thou beauteous pleader, Ah! far too beauteous! Would'st thou gain thy suit, Why glows that vermeil lip; why rolls that eye Bright as the ray of morn? why in each gesture Such inexpressive graces, but because They're native all, and will not be conceal'd? Else sure each charm betrays him, and becomes An advocate, whose silent eloquence Pleads 'gainst thy voice, and foils its tuneful power. Traitor! was this the face which thy false tongue Profan'd as vulgar? This such common beauty As the fair eye of Day beheld each hour In ev'ry clime he lighted? Base Dissembler, This instant quit our realm. ELFRIDA. Oh stay thee, Edgar, And once more hear me. At thy feet I fall As earnest, and distrest a supplicant, As e'er embrac'd the knees of Majesty. Oh! spare thy Country's guardian, Edgar, spare Thy closest, surest friend. Let not one fault Cancel his thousand, thousand acts of faith. Alas! I fall to vainest repetition. Grief, whelming grief drowns all my faculties, And leaves me nought but tears EDGAR. Rise, rise, Elfrida. ELFRIDA. Shall he then live? EDGAR. He shall, he shall, my Fair, If so he quit the realm within the space Our sentence limited. ELFRIDA, Oh stop not there; That sentence will be death to Athelwold. Think, for thou know'st full well his gentle nature, Can he support the rigour of this doom? Can he, who liv'd but in thy gracious smiles, Who'd pine, if chance those smiles a single hour Were dealt him thriftily; think, can he bear The infamy of exile? EDGAR. Hear me, Athelwold. Did I not show'r on thy much-favour'd head My thickest honours, and with gift so ready As out-run all request? Did I not hold thee Still in such open confidence of friendship, Such love as— ATHELWOLD. Sooner stab me than repeat it. EDGAR. Yet give me hearing. I repeat not this To taunt or gall thee: On my soul thy worth Did o'ertop all those honours, and thy zeal Kept pace with my best love. Nor 'till this deed— But such a deed! look there, look on that face. Thou know'st me, Athelwold, hast seen me gaze On a soft yielding fair one, 'till mine eye Shot flames. Perdition seize me, if this heart Knew love 'till now. ATHELWOLD. I see it plain, my Liege, Nor say I aught to lessen my offence. No, here I kneel, Oh! cast but on my mis'ry One kind forgiving glance; this ready sword Shall expiate all. ELFRIDA. Ah! will you? must he die? EDGAR. No, stay thee, Athelwold, and sheath thy sword; I never yet (save but this hour of rage) Deem'd thee my subject: Thou wert still my friend; And injur'd as I am, thou still art such. I do forego the word; to banish thee, Or seal thy death, transcends a friend's just right. ELFRIDA. Ah gen'rous deed! ah godlike goodness! Virgins, The King will pardon him. 'Wake each high note Of praise, and gratitude, teach Edgar's name To Harewood's farthest echo. Oh, my Sov'reign! What words can speak my thanks— EDGAR. Nay, check these transports, Lest, if I see thee thus, my soul forget Its milder purpose. I will leave thee, Lady; Yet first my lips must press this gentle hand, And breathe one soft sigh of no common fervour. Now on, my Lords—Fair wonder of thy sex, Adieu. We'll straight unto our realm of Mercia. Yet first, as was our purpose, through this forest We'll chace the nimble roebuck; may the sport More please us, than we hope. Earl Athelwold, Thou too must join our train; follow us straight. [Exeunt Edgar, &amp;c. ATHELWOLD. I will, my Liege. Elfrida, I have much For thy lov'd ear, and have but one farewel To tell it all—And yet— ELFRIDA. Ah, loiter not; It may enrage. Farewel. Be sure, take heed I come not in your talk; avoid ev'n thinking; Check ev'n the sighs of absence. Haste, my Earl, Oh haste thee, as thou lov'st thy constant wife. [Exit Athelwold. ORGAR, ELFRIDA, CHORUS. ORGAR. Thy constant wife! ah, stain of all thy race, Degen'rate girl! Henceforth be Orgar deem'd Of soft, and dove-like temper, who could see A child of his stoop to such vile abasement, And yet forbore just wrath; forbore to draw That blood she had defil'd from her mean veins. But sure thou art not mine; some Elf or Fay Did spirit away my babe, and by curst charms Thee in her cradle plac'd. Nay hang not on me. Dry, dry thy tears, they've done their office amply: Edgar has pardon'd him. No, by my earldom, I cannot think of majesty thus meanly. He'll yet avenge it.—What if chance he should not? That stops not me: I have a heart, an arm, A sword can do me justice. ELFRIDA. Ah! my Lord, Are you still merciless? Alas! I hop'd— ORGAR. What couldst thou hope, Elfrida? couldst thou think I e'er would pardon his vile perfidy, Or thy ignoble softness? ELFRIDA. Dearest Father, Frown not thus sternly on me. I would fain Touch your relenting soul, fain win your heart To fatherly forgiveness. For through life I've oft had pleasing proof how that forgiveness Stoop'd to my fond persuasion. But I fear Persuasion now has left me. My sad thoughts Are all on wing, all following Athelwold, Like unseen ministring spirits:—Pardon, Sir, That frown shall check me, I'll not mention him; I will but plead for my own weakness, plead For that soft sympathy of soul which you Deem base and servile. Base perhaps it might be, Were I of bolder sex. But I, alas!— Ah, pardon me, if Nature stampt me Woman: Gave me a heart soft, gentle, prone to pity, And very fearful: Fearful, sure with cause At this dread hour, when if one hapless word, One sigh break forth unbid, it may rekindle The Monarch's rage—What has my phrenzy said? I've wander'd from my meaning. Dearest Virgins, My rash tongue more inflames him. Oh assist me, Ye are not thus opprest with inward horror: Kneel, plead, persuade, convince— CHORUS. Alas, my Mistress, What may a servant's accents do t'appease This furious Earl? ORGAR. Ye well may spare them: Maidens, Know my firm soul's resolv'd, and be my heart As base as Athelwold's, if it forgoes The honest resolution. Think what I, What Britain suffers from this traitor's fraud: Had Edgar rais'd my daughter to his throne, Our British line, which now is doom'd to sink In vile subjection, had again assum'd The pall of royalty, with half its power, In time, perchance, the whole. But this false Saxon Shall with his life repay me. Here I'll wait His first return, and in his own domain Give him fair combat. I have known the time When this good arm had hardihood enough For thrice his prowess. What is lost through age, My just cause shall supply; and he shall fall As did the traitor Oswald, whose bold tongue Defam'd me to King Athelstan: To the ground My sharp lance nail'd the caitiff. [Exit Orgar. ELFRIDA, CHORUS. ELFRIDA. Think, my Lord, Will Athelwold, will he enter those lists, Where conquest would be parricide? Alas, He hears me not. Go, thou obdurate Father; A daughter's tears will but the more provoke thee. I will not follow him. No, poor Elfrida, All thou can'st do is here to stand, and weep, And feel that thou art wretched. CHORUS. Dearest Mistress, Restrain this flood of tears, perhaps— ELFRIDA. Perhaps! Ah! mock me not with hopes. CHORUS. We do not mean it: For Hope, though 'tis pale Sorrow's only cordial, Has yet a dull and opiate quality, Enfeebling what it lulls. It suits not you; For, as we fear— ELFRIDA. Do you too fear? Alas! I flatter'd my poor soul that all its fears Were grief's distemper'd coinage, that my love Rais'd causeless apprehensions, and at length Edgar would quite forgive. I do bethink me, My joy broke forth too rashly. When they left us, His safety was not half secur'd; my pleading Was not half heard; I should have follow'd Edgar, Claim'd more full pardon, forc'd him to embrace My sorrowing Lord. CHORUS. We fear that sorrow more Than Edgar's rage. We fear his fallen virtue. Self-condemnation works most strongly on him, Ev'n to despondency. Ev'n at his pardon, No joy flush'd on his cheek; we mark'd him well, He shew'd no sign of welcome. No, he took it As who should say, “To give me aught but death “Is a poor boon unwish'd and unaccepted.” Too much we fear he'll do some impious act— ELFRIDA. What, on his life? I thought I had explor'd Each various face of danger: this escap'd me. How miss'd I this? It suits his courage highly; Suits too his fix'd remorse.—But yet he will not: No, Athelwold, thou wilt not kill Elfrida. CHORUS. Oh may his love preserve him: may these shades Receive him soon in peace. To this blest end You sure should strive to calm your Father's rage; At least not suffer him, as now, retir'd To brood o'er his revenge. For know, Elfrida, Beneath the silent gloom of Solitude Though Peace can sit and smile; though meek Content Can keep the cheerful tenor of her soul, Ev'n in the loneliest shades; yet let not Wrath Approach, let black Revenge keep far aloof, Or soon they flame to madness. ELFRIDA. True, my Virgins; Attend me then: I'll try each winning art: Though ill such art becomes me, yet I'll aim it— Hark—Whence that noise? I heard some hasty footsteps. CHORUS. Oh Heav'ns! 'tis Edwin. ELFRIDA, EDWIN, CHORUS. ELFRIDA. Edwin, ah! that look Bespeaks too well the horror of thy errand. Tell it me all. EDWIN. Alas!— ELFRIDA. Nay, do not pause; Tell it me all. I think it will not kill me. Repeat each circumstance. I'm ready, Edwin, Ev'n for the worst. EDWIN. Then hear, and Heav'n support thee. Soon as the stag had left yon westward thicket, The King dismiss'd his Lords, each sev'ral ways, To their best sport, bidding Earl Athelwold, Lord Ardulph, and myself, attend his person. Thus parted from the rest, the Monarch pierc'd A darkling dell, which open'd in a lawn Thick set with elm around. Suddenly here He turn'd his steed, and cry'd, “This place befits “Our purpose well.” ELFRIDA. Purpose! what purpose, Edwin? 'Twas predetermin'd then, dissembling tyrant! How could I trust or hope— EDWIN. Yet give me hearing: Thus with a grave composure, and calm eye, King Edgar spake. “Now hear me, Athelwold; “Thy King has pardon'd this thy trait'rous act: “From all disloyal baseness to thy prince “Thou stand'st absolv'd; yet, know, there still remains “Somewhat to cancel more. As man to man, “As friend to friend, now, Athelwold, I call thee “Straight to defend thy life with thy good sword. “Nay, answer not; defend it gallantly. “If thy arm prosper, this my dying tongue “Shall pardon thee, and bless thee. If thou fall'st, “Thy parting breath must to my right resign “Elfrida's beauties.” At the word, both drew, Both fought; but Athelwold's was ill-play'd passion. He aim'd his falchion at the Monarch's head, Only to leave his own brave breast defenceless. And on the instant Edgar's rapid sword Pierc'd my dear master's heart. He fell to earth, And, falling, cry'd, “This wound atones for all. “Edgar, thus full aveng'd, will pardon me, “And my true wife, with chaste, connubial tears, “Embalm my memory.” He smil'd, and died. ELFRIDA. Nay, come not round me, Virgins, nor support me. I do not swoon, nor weep. I call not Heav'n T'avenge my wretchedness. I do not wish This tyrant's hand may wither with cold palsies. No, I am very patient. Heav'n is just! And, when the measure of his crimes is full, Will bare its red right arm, and launch its lightnings. 'Till then, ye elements rest: and thou, firm Earth, Ope not thy yawning jaws, but let this monster Stalk his due time on thine affrighted surface. Yes; let him still go on; still execute His savage purposes, and daily make More widows weep, as I do. Foolish eyes! Why flow ye thus unbidden? What have tears To do with grief like mine? CHORUS. Help, help, my Sisters, To bear her to the castle. ORGAR, ELFRIDA, EDWIN, CHORUS. ORGAR. As I past, Methought I heard a sound of loud lament; Elfrida, ah! ELFRIDA. Is not my father there? Withhold me not; I'll fall at his dear feet. Oh, Sir! behold your child thus lowly prostrate; Avenge her wrongs, avenge your poor Elfrida, Your helpless widow'd Daughter. ORGAR. Widow'd Daughter! What; is he slain? ELFRIDA. Inhospitably butcher'd; The tyrant's savage self—Stand you thus cool? Where is the British spirit, where the fire Of Belin's race?—Oh foolishness of grief! Alas, I had forgot; had Edgar spar'd him, That sword, to which my madness call'd for vengeance, Ere long was meant to do the bloody deed, And make the murder parricide. Have I No friend to do me right? ORGAR. Thou hast, my child; I am thy friend, thy father. Trust my care. Edwin, a word. Retire, my dearest Daughter: Virgins, conduct her in. ELFRIDA. My Father, No. What do you do? I must not be withheld. I'll to yon bloody grove, and clasp my Husband, My murder'd Husband. Why restrain me, Sir? Can my sad eye dart fire through his cold breast, And light up life anew? ORGAR. Go in, my child, And seek tranquillity. ELFRIDA. Tranquillity! I know her well; she is Death's pale-ey'd sister; She's now in yonder grove closing the lids Of my poor Athelwold. That office done, She'll bear his soul upon her gentle plumes Up to the realms of joy. I'll follow them: I know he'd have it so: He'll not be blest, Ev'n on his throne of bliss, till I am with him. CHORUS. This way, my dearest Mistress. ELFRIDA. Hold, nay hold; Crowd not around me. Let me pause a while. Albina, thou alone shalt join my mis'ry; I've much to utter to thy friendly ear Lead on, thou gentle maid; thy single arm Shall prop my trembling frame; thy single voice Speak peace to my afflictions. [Exit with the principal Virgin. ORGAR, EDWIN, SEMICHORUS. ORGAR. On your lives, Virgins, let no disturbing step approach her. Say, Edwin (for I guess 'twas you that brought These tidings hither) where was royal Edgar, When late you left him? EDWIN. At my master's side, Repentant of the stroke. ORGAR. Comes he not back To Harewood? SEMICHORUS. Heav'n forbid! Elfrida's brain Would madden at the sight. ORGAR. Mistake not, Virgins; I did not mean at this distressful hour The King should see my daughter. SEMICHORUS. No, for pity, Do not profane this sabbath of her grief. Oh! be her sorrow sacred! ORGAR. Fear not, Virgins; Her peace is my best care, and to ensure it, I'll haste this instant, by young Edwin's guidance, To find the Monarch. Some four miles from Harewood Stands old Earl Egbert's castle, my fast friend. With him will I persuade the King to sojourn, 'Till my child's grief abate; that too to speed Be it your business, Virgins: Watching ever Each happy interval, when your soft tongues May hint his praises, 'till by practice won She bear their fuller blazon. Elfrid's welfare Requires this friendly office at your hands; And Edgar's virtues bear such genuine lustre, That truth itself directs— [Exit Orgar. SEMICHORUS. As Truth directs, So only shall we act. This day is shewn What dire effects await its violation. Straight is the road of Truth, and plain; And though across the sacred way Ten thousand erring footsteps stray, 'Tis ours to walk direct, And with sage caution circumspect, Pace slowly through the solemn scene. [The principal Virgin returns. SEMICHORUS. Has Orgar left the grove? SEMICHORUS. He has, my Sister. SEMICHORUS. Then hear, and aid Elfrida's last resolve, Who takes the only way stern Fate has left To save her plighted faith for ever pure To her dead Athelwold. SEMICHORUS. Forbid it, Patience, Forbid it, that submissive calm of soul, Which teaches meek-ey'd Piety to smile Beneath the scourge of Heav'n. SEMICHORUS. Ye need not fear it, She means not self-destruction. Thanks to Heav'n, Huge and o'er-bearing as her mis'ry is, It cannot so oblit'rate from her breast The deep-grav'd rule of duty. Her pure soul Means, on the instant, to devote itself To Heav'n and holiness. Assist her straight, Lest Edgar's presence, and her Father's rage Prevent the blest intention. See, she comes. Kneel on each side, devoutly kneel around her: And breathe some pray'r in high and solemn strains, That Angels from their thrones of light may hear, And ratify her vow. ELFRIDA, CHORUS. [Elfrida kneels, and the Virgins divide into two Troops. SEMICHORUS. Hear, Angels, hear, Hear from these nether thrones of light; And O! in golden characters record Each firm, immutable, immortal word. Then wing your solemn flight Up to the heav'n of heav'ns, and there Hang the conspicuous tablet high, 'Mid the dread records of Eternity. ELFRIDA. Hear first, that Athelwold's sad Widow swears To rear a hallow'd convent o'er the place, Where stream'd his blood: there will she weep thro' life Immur'd with this chaste throng of Virgins; there Each day shall six times hear her full-voic'd choir Chant the slow requiem o'er her martyr'd Lord; There too, when midnight low'rs with awful gloom, She'll rise observant of the stated call Of waking Grief, bear the dim livid taper Along the winding isles, and at the altar Kiss ev'ry pale shrine with her trembling lips, Press the cold stone with her bent knee, and call On sainted Athelwold. SEMICHORUS. Hear, Angels, hear, Hear from these nether thrones of light; And O! in golden characters record Each firm, immutable, immortal word. Then wing your solemn flight Up to the heav'n of heav'ns, and there Hang the conspicuous tablet high, 'Mid the dread records of Eternity. ELFRIDA. Hear next, that Athelwold's sad Widow swears Never to violate the holy vow She to his truth first plighted; swears to bear The sober singleness of widowhood To her cold grave. If from this chaste resolve She ev'n in thought should swerve; if gaudy pomp, Or flatt'ring greatness e'er should tempt one wish To stray beyond this purpose; may that Heav'n, Which hears this vow, punish its violation, As heav'nly justice ought. CHORUS. Hear, Angels, hear, Hear from these nether thrones of light; And O! in golden characters record Each firm, immutable, immortal word. Then wing your solemn flight Up to the heav'n of heav'ns, and there Hang the conspicuous tablet high, 'Mid the dread records of Eternity. CARACTACUS: WRITTEN ON THE MODEL OF THE ANCIENT GREEK TRAGEDY. FIRST PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR 1759. Nos munera Phœbo Misimus; et lectas Druidum de gente Choreas. Milton. THE ARGUMENT. Caractacus, King of the Silures, having been defeated by Ostorius, the Roman Præfect, his queen taken prisoner, and his son (as it is supposed) either slain or fled, retired with his only daughter, and took sanctuary amongst the Druids in Mona. Ostorius, after the battle, leaving garrisons in the conquered country, marched to subdue the northern part of Britain, and led his troops to the frontiers of the Brigantes, then governed by Cartismandua. This queen, dreading the victorious enemy, made a truce with him; one of the conditions of which was, that she should assist the Romans in securing the British king, that he might be carried to Rome to grace the triumph of Claudius. She accordingly gave up her two sons as hostages, to be sent themselves to Rome, in case they did not seduce Caractacus from his sanctuary, to which place they were to be accompanied by Aulus Didius, and a sufficient force, to effect that design. The Drama opens on their arrival in the consecrated grove, a little before midnight, and about the time when the Druids, who form the Chorus, were preparing the ceremonial of Caractacus's admission into their order. The two princes are seized as spies; and the incidents, consequent upon this, form what is called the Episode of the piece. The Exode, or Catastrophe, is prepared by the coming of Arviragus the king's son, who, having escaped with life in the late battle, had employed the intermediate time in privately collecting his father's scattered forces, to put him again into a condition of facing the enemy. His bravery, in defending his father and the Druids, occasions the Peripetia, or change of fortune; and his death, with the final captivity of Caractacus, concludes the Tragedy. PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Aulus Didius, the Roman General. Vellinus, Son of Cartismandua. Elidurus, Son of Cartismandua. Chorus, of Druids and Bards. The Dramatic part of the Chorus is supposed to be chiefly spoken by the principal Druid; the Lyrical part sung by the Bards. Caractacus. Evelina, Daughter to Caractacus. Arviragus, Son to Caractacus. Scene, Mona. AULUS DIDIUS with Romans. This is the secret centre of the isle: Here, Romans, pause, and let the eye of wonder Gaze on the solemn scene: behold yon oak, How stern he frowns, and with his broad brown arms Chills the pale plain beneath him: mark yon altar, The dark stream brawling round its rugged base, These cliffs, these yawning caverns, this wide circus, Skirted with unhewn stone: they awe my soul, As if the very Genius of the place Himself appear'd, and with terrific tread Stalk'd through his drear domain. And yet, my friends, (If shapes like his be but the fancy's coinage) Surely there is a hidden power, that reigns 'Mid the lone majesty of untam'd nature, Controlling sober reason; tell me else, Why do these haunts of barb'rous superstition O'ercome me thus? I scorn them, yet they awe me. Call forth the British princes; in this gloom I mean to school them to our enterprise. [Enter Vellinus and Elidurus. AULUS DIDIUS, VELLINUS, ELIDURUS AULUS DIDIUS Ye pledges dear of Cartismandua's faith, Approach! and to mine uninstructed ear Explain this scene of horror. ELIDURUS. Daring Roman, Know that thou stand'st on consecrated ground; These mighty piles of magic-planted rock, Thus rang'd in mystic order, mark the place Where but at times of holiest festival The Druid leads his train. AULUS DIDIUS. Where dwells the seer? VELLINUS. In yonder shaggy cave: on which the moon Now sheds a side-long gleam. His brotherhood Possess the neighb'ring cliffs. AULUS DIDIUS. Yet up the hill Mine eye descries a distant range of caves, Delv'd in the ridges of the craggy steep: And this way still another. ELIDURUS. On the left Reside the Sages skill'd in Nature's lore: The changeful universe, its numbers, powers, Studious they measure, save when meditation Gives place to holy rites: then in the grove Each hath his rank and function. Yonder grots Are tenanted by Bards, who nightly thence, Rob'd in their flowing vests of innocent white, Descend, with harps that glitter to the moon, Hymning immortal strains. The spirits of air, Of earth, of water, nay of heav'n itself, Do listen to their lay; and oft, 'tis said, In visible shapes dance they a magic round To the high minstrelsy. Now, if thine eye Be sated with the view, haste to thy ships; And ply thine oars; for, if the Druids learn This bold intrusion, thou wilt find it hard To foil their fury. AULUS DIDIUS. Prince, I did not moor My light-arm'd shallops on this dangerous strand To sooth a fruitless curiosity: I come in quest of proud Caractacus; Who, when our veterans put his troops to flight, Found refuge here. ELIDURUS. If here the Monarch rests, Presumptuous Chief! thou might'st as well essay To pluck him from yon stars: Earth's ample range Contains no surer refuge: underneath The soil we tread, a hundred secret paths, Scoop'd through the living rock in winding maze, Lead to as many caverns, dark, and deep: In which the hoary sages act their rites Mysterious, rites of such strange potency, As, done in open day, would dim the sun, Though thron'd in noontide brightness. In such dens He may for life lie hid. AULUS DIDIUS. We know the task Most difficult: yet has thy royal mother Furnish'd the means. ELIDURUS. My mother, say'st thou, Roman? AULUS DIDIUS. In proof of that firm faith she lends to Rome, She gave you up her honour's hostages. ELIDURUS. She did: and we submit. AULUS DIDIUS. To Rome we bear you; From your dear country bear you; from your joys, Your loves, your friendships, all your souls hold precious. ELIDURUS. And dost thou taunt us, Roman, with our fate? AULUS DIDIUS. No, youth, by heav'n, I would avert that fate. Wish ye for liberty? VELLINUS, ELIDURUS. More than for life. AULUS DIDIUS. And would do much to gain it? VELLINUS. Name the task. AULUS DIDIUS. The task is easy. Haste ye to these Druids: Tell them ye come, commission'd by your Queen, To seek the great Caractacus; and call His valour to her aid, against the Legions, Which, led by our Ostorius, now assail Her frontiers. The late treaty she has seal'd Is yet unknown: and this her royal signet, Which more to mask our purpose was obtain'd, Shall be your pledge of faith. The eager king Will gladly take the charge; and, he consenting, What else remains, but to the Menaï's shore Ye lead his credulous step? there will we seize him; Bear him to Rome, the substitute for you, And give you back to freedom. VELLINUS. If the Druids— AULUS DIDIUS. If they, or he, prevent this artifice, Then force must take its way: then flaming brands, And biting axes, wielded by our soldiers, Must level these thick shades, and so unlodge The lurking savage. ELIDURUS. Gods, shall Mona perish? AULUS DIDIUS. Princes, her ev'ry trunk shall on the ground Stretch its gigantic length; unless, ere dawn, Ye lure this untam'd lion to our toils. Go then, and prosper; I shall to the ships, And there expect his coming. Youths, remember, He must to Rome to grace great Cæsar's triumph: Cæsar and Fate demand him at your hand. [Exeunt Aulus Didius and Romans. ELIDURUS, VELLINUS. ELIDURUS. And will Heav'n suffer it? Will the just gods, That tread yon spangled pavement o'er our heads, Look from their sky and yield him? Will these Druids, Their sage vicegerents, not call down the thunder? And will not instant its hot bolts be darted In such a righteous cause? Yes, good old King, Yes, last of Britons, thou art Heav'n's own pledge: And shalt be such till death. VELLINUS. What means my brother? Dost thou refuse the charge? ELIDURUS. Dost thou accept it? VELLINUS. It gives us liberty. ELIDURUS. It makes us traitors. Gods, would Vellinus do a deed of baseness? VELLINUS. Will Elidurus scorn the proffer'd boon Of freedom? ELIDURUS. Yes! when such its guilty price, Brother, I spurn it. VELLINUS. Go then, foolish boy! I'll do the deed myself. ELIDURUS. It shall not be: I will proclaim the fraud. VELLINUS. Wilt thou? 'tis well. Hie to yon cave; call loudly on the Druid; And bid him drag to ignominious death The partner of thy blood. Yet hope not thou To 'scape; for thou didst join my impious steps: Therefore his wrath shall curse thee: thou shalt live; Yet shalt thou live an interdicted wretch, All rights of nature cancell'd. ELIDURUS. Oh Vellinus! Rend not my soul: by Heav'n thou know'st I love thee, As fervently as brother e'er lov'd brother, And, loving thee, I thought I lov'd mine honour. Ah! do not wake, dear youth, in this true breast So fierce a conflict. VELLINUS. Honour's voice commands Thou should'st obey thy mother, and thy queen. Honour and Holiness alike conspire To bid thee save these consecrated groves From Roman devastation. ELIDURUS. Horrid thought! Hence let us haste, ev'n to the farthest nook Of this wide isle; nor view the sacrilege. VELLINUS, No, let us stay, and by our prosperous art Prevent the sacrilege. Mark me, my brother; More years and more experience have matur'd My sober thought: I will convince thy youth, That this our deed has ev'ry honest sanction Cool reason may demand. ELIDURUS. To Rome with reason; Try if 'twill bring her deluging ambition Into the level course of right and justice: Try if 'twill tame these insolent invaders; Who thus, in savageness of conquest, claim Whom chance of war has spar'd. Do this, and prosper. But, pray thee, do not reason from my soul Its inbred honesty: that holy flame, Howe'er eclips'd by Rome's black influence In vulgar minds, ought still to brighten ours. VELLINUS. Vain talker, leave me. ELIDURUS. No, I will not leave thee: I must not, dare not, in these perilous shades. Think, if thy fraud should fail, these holy men, How will their justice rend thy trait'rous limbs? If thou succeed'st, the fiercer pangs of conscience, How will they ever goad thy guilty soul? Mercy defend us! see, the awful Druids Are issuing from their caves: hear'st thou yon signal? Lo, on the instant all the mountain whitens With slow-descending bards. Retire, retire; This is the hour of sacrifice: to stay Is death. VELLINUS. I'll wait the closing of their rites In yonder vale: do thou, as likes thee best, Betray, or aid me. ELIDURUS. To betray thee, youth, That love forbids; honour, alas! to aid thee. [Exeunt. Enter CHORUS. SEMICHORUS. Sleep and silence reign around; Not a night-breeze wakes to blow: Circle, sons, this holy ground; Circle close, in triple row. And, if mask'd in vapours drear, Any earth-born spirit dare To hover round this sacred space, Haste with light spells the murky foe to chase. Lift your boughs of vervain blue, Dipt in cold September dew; And dash the moisture chaste, and clear, O'er the ground, and through the air, Now the place is purg'd and pure. Brethren! say, for this high hour Are the milk-white steers prepar'd, Whose necks the rude yoke never scar'd, To the furrow yet unbroke? For such must bleed beneath yon oak. SEMICHORUS. Druid, these, in order meet, Are all prepar'd. SEMICHORUS. But tell me yet, Cadwall! did thy step profound Dive into the cavern deep, Twice twelve fathom under ground, Where our sage fore-fathers sleep? Thence with reverence hast thou born, From the consecrated chest, The golden sickle, scrip, and vest, Whilom by old Belinus worn? SEMICHORUS. Druid, these, in order meet, Are all prepar'd. SEMICHORUS. But tell me yet, From the grot of charms and spells, Where our matron sister dwells, Brennus! has thy holy hand Safely brought the Druid wand? And the potent adder-stone, Gender'd 'fore th' autumnal moon? When, in undulating twine, The foaming snakes prolific join; When they hiss, and when they bear Their wond'rous egg aloof in air; Thence, before to earth it fall, The Druid, in his hallow'd pall, Receives the prize; And instant flies, Follow'd by th' envenom'd brood, 'Till he cross the chrystal flood. SEMICHORUS. Druid, these, in order meet, Are all prepar'd. SEMICHORUS. Then all's complete. And now let nine of the selected band, Whose greener years befit such station best, With wary circuit pace around the grove: And guard each inlet; watchful, lest the eye Of busy curiosity profane Pry on our rites: which now must be as close As done i' th' very central womb of earth. Occasion claims it; for Caractacus This night demands admission to our train. He, once our king, while aught his power avail'd To save his country from the rod of tyrants, That duty past, does wisely now retire To end his days in secrecy and peace; Druid with Druids, in this chief of groves, Ev'n in the heart of Mona. See, he comes! How awful is his port! mark him, my friends! He looks, as doth the tower, whose nodding walls, After the conflict of Heav'n's angry bolts, Frown with a dignity unmark'd before, Ev'n in its prime of strength. Health to the King! CARACTACUS, EVELINA, CHORUS. CARACTACUS. This holy place, methinks, doth this night wear More than its wonted gloom: Druid, these groves Have caught the dismal colouring of my soul, Changing their dark dun garbs to very sable, In pity to their guest. Hail, hallow'd oaks! Hail, British born! who, last of British race, Hold your primæval rights by nature's charter; Not at the nod of Cæsar. Happy foresters, Ye wave your bold heads in the liberal air; Nor ask, for privilege, a prætor's edict. Ye, with your tough and intertwisted roots, Grasp the firm rocks ye sprung from; and, erect In knotty hardihood, still proudly spread Your leafy banners 'gainst the tyrannous north, Who, Roman-like, assails you. Tell me, Druid, Is it not better to be such as these, Than be the thing I am? CHORUS. To be the thing Eternal Wisdom wills, is ever best. CARACTACUS. But I am lost to that predestin'd use Eternal Wisdom will'd, and fitly therefore May wish a change of being. I was born A king; and Heav'n, who bade these warrior oaks Lift their green shields against the fiery sun, To fence their subject plain, did mean, that I Should, with as firm an arm, protect my people Against the pestilent glare of Rome's ambition. I fail'd; and how I fail'd, thou know'st too well; So does the babbling world: and therefore, Druid, I would be any thing save what I am. CHORUS. See, to thy wish, the holy rites prepar'd, Which, if Heav'n frown not, consecrate thee Druid. See to the altar's base the victims led, From whose free-gushing blood ourself shall read Its high behests; which if assenting found, These hands around thy chosen limbs shall wrap The vest of sanctity; while at the act, Yon white-rob'd bards, sweeping their solemn harps, Shall lift their choral warblings to the skies, And call the gods to witness. Mean while, Prince, Bethink thee well, if aught on this vain earth Still holds too firm an union with thy soul, Estranging it from peace. CARACTACUS. I had a queen: Bear with my weakness, Druid! this tough breast Must heave a sigh, for she is unreveng'd. And can I taste true peace, she unreveng'd? So chaste, so lov'd a queen? Ah, Evelina! Hang not thus weeping on the feeble arm That could not save thy mother. EVELINA. To hang thus Softens the pang of grief; and the sweet thought, That a fond father still supports his child, Sheds, on my pensive mind, such soothing balm, As doth the blessing of these pious seers, When most they wish our welfare. Would to Heav'n A daughter's presence could as much avail, To ease her father's woes, as his doth mine. CARACTACUS. Ever most gentle! come unto my bosom: Dear pattern of the precious prize I lost, Lost, so inglorious lost;—my friends, these eyes Did see her torn from my defenceless camp; Whilst I, hemm'd round by squadrons, could not save her: My boy, still nearer to the darling pledge, Beheld her shrieking in the ruffian's arm; Beheld, and fled. EVELINA. Ah! Sir, forbear to wound My brother's fame; he fled, but to recall His scatter'd forces to pursue and save her. CARACTACUS. Daughter, he fled. Now, by yon gracious moon, That rising saw the deed, and instant hid Her blushing face in twilight's dusky veil, The flight was parricide. EVELINA. Indeed, indeed, I know him valiant; and not doubt he fell 'Mid slaughter'd thousands of the haughty foe, Victim to filial love. Arviragus! Thou hadst no sister near the bloody field, Whose sorrowing search, led by yon orb of night, Might find thy body; wash with tears thy wounds; And wipe them with her hair. CHORUS. Peace, Virgin, peace: Nor thou, sad prince, reply; whate'er he is, Be he a captive, fugitive, or corse, He is what Heav'n ordain'd: these holy groves Permit no exclamation 'gainst Heav'n's will To violate their echoes: Patience here, Her meek hands folded on her modest breast, In mute submission lifts th' adoring eye, Ev'n to the storm that wrecks her. EVELINA. Holy Druid, If aught my erring tongue has said pollutes This sacred place, I from my soul abjure it; And will these lips bar with eternal silence, Rather than speak a word, or act a deed Unmeet for thy sage daughters; blessing first This hallow'd hour, that takes me from the world, And joins me to their sober sisterhood. CHORUS. 'Tis wisely said. See, Prince, this prudent maid, Now, while the ruddy flame of sparkling youth Glows on her beauteous cheek, can quit the world Without a sigh, whilst thou— CARACTACUS. Would save my queen From a base ravisher; would wish to plunge This falchion in his breast, and so avenge Insulted royalty. Oh holy men! Ye are the sons of piety and peace; Ye never felt the sharp vindictive spur, That goads the injur'd warrior; the hot tide, That flushes crimson on the conscious cheek Of him, who burns for glory; else indeed Ye much would pity me: would curse the fate That coops me here inactive in your groves, Robs me of hope, tells me this trusty steel Must never cleave one Roman helm again: Never avenge my queen, nor free my country. CHORUS. 'Tis Heav'n's high will— CARACTACUS. I know it, reverend fathers! 'Tis Heav'n's high will, that these poor aged eyes Shall never more behold that virtuous woman, To whom my youth was constant; 'twas Heav'n's will To take her from me at that very hour, When best her love might sooth me; that black hour, (May Memory ever raze it from her records) When all my squadrons fled, and left their king Old and defenceless: him, who nine whole years Had taught them how to conquer: Yes, my friends, For nine whole years against the sons of rapine I led my veterans, oft to victory, Never 'till then to shame. Bear with me, Druid; I've done: begin the rites. CHORUS. Oh would to Heav'n A frame of mind, more fitted to these rites, Possest thee, Prince! that Resignation meek, That dove-ey'd Peace, handmaid of Sanctity, Approach'd this altar with thee: 'stead of these, See I not gaunt Revenge, ensanguin'd Slaughter, And mad Ambition, clinging to thy soul, Eager to snatch thee back to their domain, Back to a vain and miserable world; Whose misery, and vanity, though try'd, Thou still hold'st dearer than these solemn shades, Where Quiet reigns with Virtue? Try we yet What Holiness can do! for much it can: Much is the potency of pious prayer: And much the sacred influence convey'd By sage mysterious office: when the soul, Snatch'd by the power of music from her cell Of fleshly thraldom, feels herself upborn On plumes of ecstasy, and boldly springs, 'Mid swelling harmonies and pealing hymns, Up to the porch of heav'n. Strike, then, ye Bards! Strike all your strings symphonious; wake a strain May penetrate, may purge, may purify, His yet unhallow'd bosom; call ye hither The airy tribe, that on yon mountain dwell, Ev'n on majestic Snowdon; they, who never Deign visit mortal men, save on some cause Of highest import, but, sublimely shrin'd On its hoar top in domes of crystalline ice, Hold converse with those spirits, that possess The skies' pure sapphire, nearest heav'n itself. ODE. I. 1. Mona on Snowdon calls: Hear, thou king of mountains, hear; Hark, she speaks from all her strings; Hark, her loudest echo rings; King of mountains, bend thine ear: Send thy spirits, send them soon, Now, when midnight and the moon Meet upon thy front of snow: See, their gold and ebon rod, Where the sober sisters nod, And greet in whispers sage and slow. Snowdon mark! 'tis Magic's hour; Now the mutter'd spell hath power; Power to rend thy ribs of rock, And burst thy base with thunder's shock: But to thee no ruder spell Shall Mona use, than those that dwell In music's secret cells, and lie Steep'd in the stream of harmony. I. 2. Snowdon has heard the strain: Hark, amid the wond'ring grove Other harpings answer clear, Other voices meet our ear, Pinions flutter, shadows move, Busy murmurs hum around, Rustling vestments brush the ground; Round, and round, and round they go, Through the twilight, through the shade, Mount the oak's majestic head, And gild the tufted misletoe. Cease, ye glitt'ring race of light, Close your wings, and check your flight: Here, arrang'd in order due, Spread your robes of saffron hue; For lo, with more than mortal fire, Mighty Mador smites the lyre: Hark, he sweeps the master-strings; Listen all— CHORUS. Break off; a sullen smoke involves the altar; The central oak doth shake; I hear the sound Of steps profane: Caractacus, retire; Bear hence the victims; Mona is polluted. SEMICHORUS. Father, as we did watch the eastern side, We spied and instant seiz'd two stranger youths, Who, in the bottom of a shadowy dell, Held earnest converse: Britons do they seem, And of Brigantian race. CHORUS. Haste, drag them hither. VELLINUS, ELIDURUS, CHORUS. ELIDURUS. Oh spare, ye sage and venerable Druids! Your countrymen and sons. CHORUS. And are ye Britons? Unheard of profanation! Rome herself, Ev'n impious Rome, whom conquest makes more impious, Would not have dar'd so rashly. Oh! for words, Big with the fiercest force of execration, To blast the deed, and doers. ELIDURUS. Spare the curse, Oh spare our youth! CHORUS. Is it not now the hour, The holy hour, when to the cloudless height Of yon starr'd concave climbs the full-orb'd moon, And to this nether world in solemn stillness Gives sign, that to the list'ning ear of Heav'n Religion's voice should plead? The very babe Knows this, and, 'chance awak'd, his little hands Lifts to the gods, and on his innocent couch Calls down a blessing. Shall your manly years Plead ignorance, and impiously presume To tread, with vile unconsecrated feet, On Mona's hallow'd plain? know, wretches, know, At any hour such boldness is a crime, At this 'tis sacrilege. VELLINUS. Were Mona's plain More hallow'd still, hallow'd as is Heav'n's self, The cause might plead our pardon. ELIDURUS. Mighty Druid! True, we have rashly dar'd, yet forc'd by duty, Our sov'reign's mandate— VELLINUS. Elder by my birth, Brother, I claim, in right of eldership, To open our high embassy. CHORUS. Speak then; But see thy words answer in honest weight To this proud prelude. Youth! they must be weighty, T' atone for such a crime. VELLINUS. If then to give New nerves to vanquish'd valour; if to do, What, with the blessing of the gods, may save A bleeding country from oppression's sword, Be weighty business, know, on our commission, And on its hop'd success, that weight depends. CHORUS. Declare it then at once, briefly and boldly. VELLINUS. Caractacus is here. CHORUS. Say'st thou, proud boy? 'Tis boldly said, and, grant 'twere truly said, Think'st thou he were not here from fraud or force As safe, as in a camp of conquerors? Here, youth, he would be guarded by the gods; Their own high hostage; and each sacred hair Of his selected head, would in these caverns Sleep with the unsunn'd silver of the mine, As precious and as safe; record the time, When Mona e'er betray'd the hapless wretch, That made her groves his refuge. VELLINUS. Holy Druid! Think not so harshly of our enterprise. Can force, alas! dwell in our unarm'd hands? Can fraud in our young bosoms? No, dread Seer! Our business told, I trust thou'lt soon disclaim The vain suspicion; and thy holy ear (Be brave Caractacus or here or absent) Shall instant learn it. From the north we come; The sons of her, whose Heav'n-intrusted sway Blesses the bold Brigantes; men who firmly Have three long moons withstood those Roman powers Which, led by fell Ostorius, still assail Our frontiers: yet so oft have our stout swords Repell'd their hot assault, that now, like falcons, They hang suspended, loth to quit their prey, Nor daring yet to seize it. Such the state Of us and Rome; in which our prudent mother, Revolving what might best secure her country From this impending ruin, gave us charge To seek the great Caractacus, and call His valour to her aid, to lead her bands, To fight the cause of liberty and Britain, And quell these ravagers. [Caractacus starts from behind the altar. CARACTACUS, VELLINUS, ELIDURUS, CHORUS. CARACTACUS. And ye have found me; Friends, ye have found me: lead me to your queen, And the last purple drop in these old veins Shall fall for her and Britain. CHORUS. Rash, rash Prince! VELLINUS. Ye blest immortal Powers! is this the man, The more than man, who for nine bloody years Withstood all Rome? He is; that warlike front, Seam'd o'er with honest scars, proclaims he is: Kneel, brother, kneel, while in his royal hand We lodge the signet: this, in pledge of faith, Great Cartismandua sends, and with it tells thee She has a nobler pledge than this behind; Thy Queen— CARACTACUS. Guideria! VELLINUS. Safely with our mother. CARACTACUS. How, when, where rescu'd? mighty gods, I thank ye; For it is true; this signet speaks it true. Oh tell me briefly. VELLINUS. In a sally, Prince, Which, wanting abler chiefs, my gracious mother Committed to my charge, our troops assail'd One outwork of the camp; the mask of night Favour'd our arms, and there my happy hand Was doom'd with other prisoners to release The captive matron. CARACTACUS. Let me clasp thee, youth, And thou shalt be my son: I had one, stranger, Just of thy years; he look'd like thee right honest; Had just that freeborn boldness on his brow, And yet he fail'd me. Were it not for him, Who, as thou seest, ev'n at this hour of joy, Draws tears down mine old cheek, I were as blest As the great gods. Oh, he has all disgrac'd His high-born ancestry! But I'll forget him. Haste, Evelina, barb my knotty spear, Bind fast this trusty falchion to my thigh, My bow, my target— CHORUS. Rash Caractacus! What hast thou done? What dost thou mean to do? CARACTACUS. To save my country. CHORUS. To betray thyself. That thou hast done; the rest thou can'st not do, If Heav'n forbids; and of its awful will Thy fury recks not: Has the bleeding victim Pour'd a propitious stream? The milk-white steeds Unrein'd and neighing pranc'd with fav'ring steps? Say, when these youths approach'd, did not a gust Of livid smoke involve the bickering flame? Did not the forest tremble? Every omen Led thee to doubt their honesty of purpose; And yet, before their tongues could tell that purpose, Ere I had tender'd, as our laws ordain, Their test of faith, thy rudeness rush'd before me, Infringing my just rights. CARACTACUS. Druid, methinks, At such a time, in such a cause, Reproof Might 'bate its sternness. Now, by Heav'n, I feel, Beyond all omens, that within my breast, Which marshals me to conquest; something here That snatches me beyond all mortal fears, Lifts me to where upon her jasper throne Sits flame-rob'd Victory, who calls me son, And crowns me with a palm, whose deathless green Shall bloom when Cæsar's fades. CHORUS. Vain confidence! CARACTACUS. Yet I submit in all— CHORUS. 'Tis meet thou should'st. Thou art a King, a sov'reign o'er frail man; I am a Druid, servant of the gods; Such service is above such sov'reignty, As well thou know'st: if they should prompt these lips To interdict the thing thou dar'st to do, What would avail thy daring! CARACTACUS. Holy man! But thou wilt bless it; Heav'n will bid thee bless it; Thou know'st that, when we fight to save our country, We fight the cause of Heav'n. The man that falls, Falls hallow'd; falls a victim for the gods; For them and for their altars. CHORUS. Valiant Prince! Think not we lightly rate our country's weal, Or thee, our country's champion: Well we know The glorious meed of those exalted souls, Who flame like thee for freedom: Mark me, Prince! The time will come, when Destiny and Death, Thron'd in a burning car, the thund'ring wheels Arm'd with gigantic scythes of adamant Shall scour this field of life: and in the rear The fiend Oblivion: kingdoms, empires, worlds Melt in the general blaze: when, lo, from high Andraste darting, catches from the wreck The roll of fame, claps her ascending plumes, And stamps on orient stars each patriot name, Round her eternal dome. CARACTACUS. Speak ever thus, And I will hear thee, 'till attention faint In heedless ecstasy. CHORUS. This though we know, Let man beware with headlong zeal to rush Where slaughter calls; it is not courage, Prince, No, nor the pride and practis'd skill in arms, That gains this meed: the warrior is no patriot, Save when, obsequious to the will of Heav'n, He draws the sword of vengeance. CARACTACUS. Surely, Druid, Such fair occasion speaks the will of Heav'n— CHORUS. Monarch, perchance thou hast a fair occasion; But, if thou hast, the gods will soon declare it: Their sov'reign will thou know'st not; this to learn Demands our search. Ye mortals all retire! Leave ye the grove to us and Inspiration; Nor let a step, or ev'n one glance profane, Steal from your caverns: stay, my holy brethren, Ye time-ennobled Seers, whose rev'rend brows Full eighty winters whiten; you, ye Bards, Leoline, Cadwall, Hoel, Cantaber, Attend upon our slumbers: Wond'rous men, Ye, whose skill'd fingers know how best to lead, Through all the maze of sound, the wayward step Of Harmony, recalling oft, and oft Permitting her unbridled course to rush Through dissonance to concord, sweetest then Ev'n when expected harshest. Mador, thou Alone shalt lift thy voice; no choral peal Shall drown thy solemn warblings; thou best know'st That opiate charm which lulls corporeal sense: Thou hast the key, great Bard! that best can ope The portal of the soul; unlock it straight, And lead the pensive pilgrim on her way, Through the vast regions of futurity. [Exeunt Caractacus, Vellinus, &amp;c. CHORUS. ODE. I. 1. Hail, thou harp of Phrygian fame! In years of yore that Camber bore From Troy's sepulchral flame; With ancient Brute, to Britain's shore The mighty minstrel came: Sublime upon the burnish'd prow, He bad thy manly modes to flow; Britain heard the descant bold, She flung her white arms o'er the sea; Proud in her leafy bosom to enfold The freight of harmony. I. 2. Mute 'till then was ev'ry plain, Save where the flood o'er mountains rude Tumbled his tide amain: And Echo from th' impending wood Resounded the hoarse strain; While from the north the sullen gale With hollow whistlings shook the vale; Dismal notes, and answer'd soon By savage howl the heaths among, What time the wolf doth bay the trembling moon, And thin the bleating throng. I. 3. Thou spak'st, imperial Lyre, The loud roar ceas'd, and airs from high Lapt the land in ecstasy: Fancy, the fairy, with thee came; And Inspiration, bright-ey'd dame, Oft at thy call would leave her sapphire sky; And, if not vain the verse presumes, Ev'n now some chaste divinity is near: For lo! the sound of distant plumes Pants through the pathless desert of the air. 'Tis not the flight of her; 'Tis Sleep, her dewy harbinger; Change, my harp, Oh change thy measures; Cull, from thy mellifluous treasures, Notes that steal on even feet, Ever slow, yet never pausing, Mixt with many a warble sweet, In a ling'ring cadence closing, While the pleas'd Power sinks gently down the skies, And seals with hand of down the Druid's slumb'ring eyes. II. 1. Thrice I pause, and thrice I sound The central string, and now I ring (By measur'd lore profound) A sevenfold chime, and sweep and swing Above, below, around, To mix thy music with the spheres, That warble to immortal ears. Inspiration hears the call: She rises from her throne above, And sudden as the glancing meteors fall, She comes, she fills the grove. II. 2. High her port; her waving hand A pencil bears; the days, the years, Arise at her command, And each obedient colouring wears. Lo, where Time's pictur'd band In hues ethereal glide along: Oh mark the transitory throng; Now they dazzle, now they die, Instant they flit from light to shade, Mark the blue forms of faint futurity, Oh mark them ere they fade. II. 3. Whence was that inward groan? Why bursts through closed lids the tear? Why uplifts the bristling hair Its white and venerable shade? Why down the consecrated head Courses in chilly drops the dew of fear? All is not well, the pale-ey'd moon Curtains her head in clouds, the stars retire, Save from the sultry south alone The swart star flings his pestilential fire; Ev'n Sleep herself will fly, If not recall'd by Harmony. Wake, my lyre! thy softest numbers, Such as nurse ecstatic slumbers, Sweet as tranquil virtue feels When the toil of life is ending, While from the earth the spirit steals, And, on new-born plumes ascending, Hastens to lave in the bright fount of day, 'Till Destiny prepare a shrine of purer clay. [The Druid waking, speaks. CHORUS. It may not be. Avaunt, terrific axe! Why hangs thy bright edge glaring o'er the grove? Oh for a giant's nerve to ward the stroke! It bows, it falls. Where am I? hush, my soul! 'Twas all a dream. Resume no more the strain: The hour is past: my brethren! what ye saw, (If what ye saw, as by your looks I read, Bore like ill-omen'd shape) hold it in silence. The midnight air falls chilly on my breast; And now I shiver, now a feverish glow Scorches my vitals. Hark, some step approaches. EVELINA, CHORUS. EVELINA. Thus with my wayward fears, to burst unbidden On yon dread synod, rousing, as ye seem, From holy trance, appears a desperate deed, Ev'n to the wretch who dares it. CHORUS. Virgin! quickly Pronounce the cause, EVELINA Bear with a simple maid, Too prone to fear; perchance my fears are vain. CHORUS. But yet declare them. EVELINA. I suspect me much The faith of these Brigantes. CHORUS. Say'st thou, Virgin? Heed what thou say'st; suspicion is a guest That in the breast of man, of wrathful man, Too oft' his welcome finds: yet seldom sure In that submissive calm that smooths the mind Of maiden innocence. EVELINA. I know it well, Yet must I still distrust the elder stranger: For while he talks, (and much the flatterer talks) His brother's silent carriage gives disproof Of all his boast; indeed I mark'd it well; And, as my father with the elder held Bold speech and warlike, as is still his wont When fir'd with hope of conquest, oft I saw A sigh unbidden heave the younger's breast, Half check'd as it was rais'd; sometimes, methought, His gentle eye would cast a glance on me, As if he pitied me; and then again Would fasten on my father, gazing there To veneration; then he'd sigh again, Look on the ground, and hang his modest head Most pensively. CHORUS. This may demand, my brethren, More serious search: Virgin! proceed. EVELINA. 'Tis true, My father, rapt in high heroic zeal, His ev'ry thought big with his country's freedom, Heeds not the different carriage of these brethren, The elder takes him wholly; yet methinks, The younger's manners have I know not what, That speaks him far more artless. This besides, Is it not strange, if, as the tale reports, My mother sojourns with this distant Queen, She should not send or to my sire, or me, Some fond remembrance of her love? ah! none, With tears I speak it, none, not her dear blessing Has reach'd my longing ears. CHORUS. The gods, my brethren, Have wak'd these doubts in the untainted breast Of this mild maiden; oft to female softness, Oft to the purity of virgin souls Doth Heav'n its voluntary light dispense, When victims bleed in vain. They must be spies, Hie thee, good Cantaber, and to our presence Summon the young Brigantian. EVELINA. Do not that, Or, if ye do, yet treat him nothing sternly: The softest terms from such a tender breast Will draw confession, and, if ye shall find The treason ye suspect, forbear to curse him. (Not that my weakness means to guide your wisdom) Yet, as I think he would not wittingly E'er do a deed of baseness, were it granted That I might question him, my heart forebodes It more could gain by gentleness and prayers, Than will the fiercest threats. CHORUS. Perchance it may: And quickly shalt thou try. But see the King! And with him both the youths. EVELINA. Alas! my fears Forewent my errand, else had I inform'd thee That therefore did I come, and from my father, To gain admission. Mark the younger, Druid! How sad he seems; oft did he in the cave So fold his arms— CHORUS. We mark him much, and much The elder's free and dreadless confidence. Virgin, retire awhile in yonder vale, Nor, 'till thy royal father quits the grove, Resume thy station here. [Exit Evelina. CARACTACUS, CHORUS, VELLINUS, ELIDURUS. CARACTACUS. Forgive me, Druid! My eager soul no longer could sustain The pangs of expectation; hence I sent The virgin innocence of Evelina, Safest to break upon your privacy. She not return'd, Oh pardon, that uncall'd I follow: the great cause, I trust, absolves me: 'Tis your's, 'tis freedom's, 'tis the cause of Heav'n; And sure Heav'n owns it such. CHORUS. Caractacus! All that by sage and sanctimonious rites Might of the gods be ask'd, we have essay'd; And yet, nor to our wish, nor to their wont, Gave they benign assent. CARACTACUS. Death to our hopes! CHORUS. While yet we lay in sacred slumber tranc'd, Sullen and sad to Fancy's frighted eye Did shapes of dun and murky hue advance, In train tumultuous, all of gesture strange, And passing horrible; starting we wak'd, Yet felt no waking calm; still all was dark, Still rang our tinkling ears with screams of woe. Suspicious tremors still— VELLINUS. Of what suspicious? Druid, our Queen— CHORUS. Restrain thy wayward tongue, Insolent youth! in such licentious mood To interrupt our speech ill suits thy years, And worse our sanctity. CARACTACUS. 'Tis his distress Makes him forget, what else his reverent zeal Would pay ye holily. Think what he feels, Poor youth! who fears yon moon, before she wanes, May see his country conquer'd; see his mother The victor's slave, her royal blood debas'd, Dragging her chains through the throng'd streets of Rome, To grace Oppression's triumph. Horrid thought! Say, can it be that he, whose strenuous youth Adds vigour to his virtue, e'er can bear This patiently? He comes to ask my aid, And, that withheld, (as now he needs must fear) What means, alas! are left? Search Britain round, What chief dares cope with Rome? what king but holds His loan of power at a Proconsul's will, At best a scepter'd slave? VELLINUS. Yes, Monarch, yes, If Heaven restrain thy formidable sword, Or to its stroke deny that just success Which Heav'n alone can give, I fear me much Our Queen, ourselves, nay Britain's self, must perish. CARACTACUS. But is not this a fear makes virtue vain; Tears from yon minist'ring regents of the sky Their right? Plucks from firm-handed Providence The golden reins of sublunary sway, And gives them to blind Chance: If this be so, If Tyranny must lord it o'er the earth, There's Anarchy in heav'n. Nay, frown not, Druid, I do not think 'tis thus. CHORUS. We trust thou do'st not. CARACTACUS. Masters of Wisdom! No: my soul confides In that all-healing and all-forming Power, Who on the radiant day when Time was born, Cast his broad eye upon the wild of ocean, And calm'd it with a glance: then plunging deep His mighty arm, pluck'd from its dark domain This throne of freedom, lifted it to light, Girt it with silver cliffs, and call'd it Britain: He did, and will preserve it. CHORUS. Pious Prince! In that all-healing and all-forming Power Still let thy soul confide; but not in men, No, not in these, ingenuous as they seem, 'Till they are try'd by that high test of faith Our ancient laws ordain. VELLINUS. Illustrious Seer! Methinks our Sov'reign's signet well might plead Her envoy's faith. Thy pardon, mighty Druid! Not for ourselves, but for our Queen we plead; Mistrusting us, ye wound her honour. CHORUS. Peace; Our will admits no parley. Thither, Youths, Turn your astonish'd eyes; behold yon huge And unhewn sphere of living adamant, Which, pois'd by magic, rests its central weight On yonder pointed rock; firm as it seems, Such is its strange and virtuous property, It moves obsequious to the gentlest touch Of him, whose breast is pure; but to a traitor, Though ev'n a giant's prowess nerv'd his arm, It stands as fixt as Snowdon. No reply; The gods command that one of you must now Approach and try it: in your snowy vests, Ye Priests, involve the lots, and to the younger, As is our wont, tender the choice of Fate. ELIDURUS. Heav'ns! is it fall'n on me? CHORUS. Young Prince, it is: Prepare thee for thy trial. ELIDURUS. Gracious gods! Who may look up to your tremendous thrones, And say his breast is pure? All-searching Powers, Ye know already how and what I am; And what ye mean to publish me in Mona, To that I yield and tremble. CARACTACUS. Rouse thee, Youth! And, with that courage honest truth supplies, (For sure ye both are true) haste to the trial: Behold I lead thee on. CHORUS. Prince, we arrest Thy hasty step: to witness this high test Pertains to us alone. A while retire, And in yon cave his brother be thy charge; The trial past, again we will confer, Touching that part which Heav'n's deciding choice Wills thee to act. [Exeunt Caractacus and Vellinus. CHORUS, ELIDURUS. CHORUS. Now be the rites prepar'd: And now, ye Bards, chant ye that custom'd hymn, The prelude of this fam'd solemnity. ODE. I. 1. Thou Spirit pure, that spread'st unseen Thy pinions o'er this pond'rous sphere, And, breathing through each rigid vein, Fill'st with stupendous life the marble mass, And bid'st it bow upon its base, When sov'reign Truth is near; Spirit invisible! to thee We swell the solemn harmony; Hear us, and aid: Thou, that in Virtue's cause O'er-rulest Nature's laws, Oh hear, and aid with influence high The sons of Peace and Piety. I. 2. First-born of that etherial tribe Call'd into birth ere time or place, Whom wave nor wind can circumscribe, Heirs of the liquid liberty of light, That float on rainbow pennons bright Through all the wilds of space; Yet thou alone of all thy kind Can'st range the regions of the mind, Thou only know'st That dark meand'ring maze, Where wayward Falsehood strays, And seizing swift the lurking sprite, Forces her forth to shame and light. I. 3. Thou can'st enter the dark cell Where the vulture Conscience slumbers, And, unarm'd by charming spell, Or magic numbers, Can'st rouse her from her formidable sleep, And bid her dart her raging talons deep: Yet, ah! too seldom doth the furious fiend Thy bidding wait; vindictive, self-prepar'd, She knows her torturing time; too sure to rend The trembling heart, when Virtue quits her guard. Pause then, celestial guest! And, brooding on thine adamantine sphere, If fraud approach, Spirit! that fraud declare; To Conscience and to Mona leave the rest. CHORUS. Heard'st thou the awful invocation, Youth, Wrapt in those holy harpings? ELIDURUS. Sage, I did; And it came o'er my soul as doth the thunder, While distant yet, with an expected burst, It threats the trembling ear. Now to the trial. CHORUS. Ere that, bethink thee well what rig'rous doom Attends thine act; if failing, certain death: So certain, that in our absolving tongues Rests not that power may save thee: Thou must die. EVELINA, ELIDURUS, CHORUS. EVELINA. Die, say'st thou? Druid! ELIDURUS. Evelina here! Lead to the rock. CHORUS. No, Youth, a while we spare thee; And, in our stead, permit this royal maiden To urge thee first with virgin gentleness; Respect our clemency, and meet her questions With answers prompt and true; so may'st thou 'scape A sterner trial. ELIDURUS. Rather to the rock.— EVELINA. Dost thou disdain me, Prince? Lost as I am, Methinks the daughter of Caractacus Might merit milder treatment: I was born To royal hopes and promise, nurs'd i' th' lap Of soft prosperity; alas the change! I meant but to address a few brief words To this young Prince, and he doth turn his eye, And scorns to answer me. ELIDURUS. Scorn thee, sweet Maid? No, 'tis the fear— EVELINA. And can'st thou fear me, Youth? Ev'n while I led a life of royalty, I bore myself to all with meek deportment, In nothing harsh, or cruel: and, howe'er Misfortune works upon the minds of men, (For some, they say, it turns to very stone,) Mine I am sure it softens. Wert thou guilty, Yet I should pity thee; nay, wert thou leagued To load this suffering heart with more misfortunes, Still should I pity thee; nor e'er believe Thou would'st, on free and voluntary choice, Betray the innocent. ELIDURUS. Indeed I would not. EVELINA. No, gracious Youth, I do believe thou would'st not: For on thy brow the liberal hand of Heav'n Has pourtray'd truth as visible and bold, As were the pictur'd suns that deckt the brows Of our brave ancestors. Say then, young Prince, (For therefore have I wish'd to question thee) Bring ye no token of a mother's fondness To her expecting child? Gentle thou seem'st, And sure that gentleness would prompt thine heart To visit and to sooth with courteous office, Distress like her's. A captive and a queen Has more than common claim for pity, Prince, And ev'n the ills of venerable age Were cause enough to move thy tender nature. The tears o'ercharge thine eye. Alas, my fears! Sickness or sore infirmity had seiz'd her, Before thou left'st the palace, else her lips Had to thy care intrusted some kind message, And blest her hapless daughter by thy tongue. Would she were here! ELIDURUS. Would Heav'n she were! EVELINA. Ah why? ELIDURUS. Because you wish it. EVELINA. Thanks, ingenuous Youth, For this thy courtesy. Yet, if the Queen Thy mother shine with such rare qualities, As late thy brother boasted, she will calm Her woes, and I shall clasp her aged knees Again, in peace and liberty.—Alas! He speaks not; all my fears are just. ELIDURUS. What fears? The Queen Guideria is not dead. EVELINA. Not dead! But is she in that happy state of freedom, Which we were taught to hope? Why sigh'st thou, Youth? Thy years have yet been prosp'rous. Did thy father E'er lose a kingdom? Did captivity E'er seize thy shrieking mother? thou can'st go To yonder cave, and find thy brother safe: He is not lost, as mine is. Youth, thou sigh'st Again; thou hast not sure such cause of sorrows; But if thou hast, give me thy griefs, I pray thee; I have a heart can softly sympathize, And sympathy is soothing. ELIDURUS. Oh gods! gods! She tears my soul. What shall I say? EVELINA. Perchance, For all in this bad world must have their woes, Thou too hast thine; and may'st, like me, be wretched. Haply amid the ruinous waste of war, 'Mid that wild havock, which those sons of blood Bring on our groaning country, some chaste maid, Whose tender soul was link'd by love to thine, Might fall the trembling prey to Roman rage, Ev'n at the golden hour, when holy rites Had seal'd your virtuous vows. If it were so, Indeed I pity her. ELIDURUS. Not that; not that. Never 'till now did Beauty's matchless beam— But I am dumb. EVELINA. Why that dejected eye? And why this silence? that some weighty grief O'erhangs thy soul, thy ev'ry look proclaims. Why then refuse it words? The heart, that bleeds From any stroke of fate or human wrongs, Loves to disclose itself, that list'ning Pity May drop a healing tear upon the wound. 'Tis only, when with inbred horror smote At some base act, or done, or to be done, That the recoiling soul, with conscious dread, Shrinks back into itself. But thou, good Youth— ELIDURUS. Cease, royal maid! permit me to depart. EVELINA. Yet hear me, stranger! Truth and Secresy, Though friends, are seldom necessary friends— ELIDURUS. I go to try my truth— EVELINA. Oh! go not hence In wrath; think not, that I suspect thy virtue: Yet ignorance may oft make virtue slide, And if— ELIDURUS. In pity spare me. EVELINA. If thy brother— Nay, start not, do not turn thine eye from mine; Speak, I conjure thee, is his purpose honest? I know the guilty price, that barbarous Rome Sets on my father's head; and gold, vile gold, Has now a charm for Britons: Brib'd by this, Should he betray him—Yes, I see thou shudder'st At the dire thought; yet not, as if 'twere strange; But as our fears were mutual. Ah, young stranger; That open face scarce needs a tongue to utter What works within. Come then, ingenuous Prince, And instant make discovery to the Druid, While yet 'tis not too late. ELIDURUS. Ah! what discover? Say, whom must I betray? EVELINA. Thy brother. ELIDURUS. Ha! EVELINA. Who is no brother, if his guilty soul Teem with such perfidy. Oh all ye stars! Can he be brother to a youth like thee, Who would betray an old and honour'd king, That king his countryman, and one whose prowess Once guarded Britain 'gainst th' assailing world? Can he be brother to a youth like thee, Who from a young, defenceless, innocent maid, Would take that king her father? Make her suffer All that an orphan suffers? More perchance: The ruffian foe.—Oh tears, ye choke my utterance! Can he be brother to a youth like thee, Who would defile his soul by such black deeds? It cannot be—And yet, thou still art silent. Turn, youth, and see me weep. Ah, see me kneel: I am of royal blood, not wont to kneel: Yet will I kneel to thee. Oh save my father! Save a distressful maiden from the force Of barbarous men! Be thou a brother to me, For mine alas! Ah! [Sees Arviragus entering. ARVIRAGUS, EVELINA, ELIDURUS, CHORUS. ARVIRAGUS. Evelina, rise! Know, maid, I ne'er will tamely see thee kneel, Ev'n at the foot of Cæsar. EVELINA. 'Tis himself: And he will prove my father's fears were false, False, as his son is brave. Thou best of brothers, Come to my arms. Where hast thou been, thou wand'rer? How wer't thou sav'd? Indeed, Arviragus, I never shed such tears, since thou wer't lost, For these are tears of rapture. ARVIRAGUS. Evelina! Fain would I greet thee, as a brother ought: But wherefore didst thou kneel? EVELINA. Oh! ask not now. ARVIRAGUS. By heav'n I must, and he must answer me, Whoe'er he be. What art thou, sullen stranger? ELIDURUS. A Briton. ARVIRAGUS. Brief and bold. EVELINA. Ah, spare the taunt: He merits not thy wrath. Behold the Druids; Lo, they advance: with holy reverence first Thou must address their sanctity ARVIRAGUS. I will. But see, proud boy, thou do'st not quit the grove, 'Till time allows us parley. ELIDURUS. Prince, I mean not. ARVIRAGUS. Sages, and sons of Heav'n! Illustrious Druids! Abruptly I approach your sacred presence: Yet such dire tidings— CHORUS. On thy peril, peace! Thou stand'st accus'd, and by a father's voice, Of crimes abhorr'd, of cowardice and flight; And therefore may'st not in these sacred groves Utter polluted accents. Quickly say, Wherefore thou fled'st? For that base fact unclear'd We hold no farther converse. ARVIRAGUS. Oh ye gods! Am I the son of your Caractacus? And could I fly? CHORUS. Waste not or time or words: But tell us why thou fled'st? ARVIRAGUS. I fled not, Druid! By the great gods I fled not! save to stop Our dastard troops, that basely turn'd their backs. I stopt, I rallied them, when lo! a shaft Of random cast did level me with earth, Where pale and senseless, as the slain around me, I lay till midnight: Then, as from long trance Awoke, I crawl'd upon my feeble limbs To a lone cottage, where a pitying hind Lodg'd me, and nourish'd me. My strength repair'd, It boots not that I tell, what humble arts Compell'd I us'd to screen me from the foe. How now a peasant from a beggarly scrip I sold cheap food to slaves, that nam'd the price, Nor after gave it. Now a minstrel poor With ill-tun'd harp, and uncouth descant shrill I ply'd a thriftless trade, and by such shifts Did win obscurity to shroud my name. At length to other conquests in the north Ostorius led his legions: Safer now, Yet not secure, I to some valiant chiefs, Whom war had spar'd, discover'd what I was; And with them plann'd, how surest we might draw Our scatter'd forces to some rocky fastness In rough Caernarvon, there to breathe in freedom, If not with brave incursion to oppress The thinly-station'd foe. And soon our art So well avail'd, that now at Snowdon's foot Full twenty troops of hardy veterans wait To call my sire their leader. CHORUS. Valiant Youth— EVELINA. He is—I said he was a valiant youth, Nor has he sham'd his race. CHORUS. We do believe Thy modest tale: And may the righteous gods Thus ever shed upon thy noble breast Discretion's cooling dew. When nurtur'd so, Then, only then, doth valour bloom mature. ARVIRAGUS. Yet vain is valour, howsoe'er it bloom: Druid, the gods frown on us. All my hopes Are blasted; I shall ne'er rejoin my friends, Ne'er bless them with my father. Holy men, I have a tale to tell, will shake your souls. Your Mona is invaded; Rome approaches, Ev'n to these groves approaches. SEMICHORUS. Horror! Horror! ARVIRAGUS. Late as I landed on yon highest beach, Where nodding from the rocks the poplars fling Their scatter'd arms, and dash them in the wave, There were their vessels moor'd, as if they sought Concealment in the shade, and as I past Up yon thick-planted ridge, I 'spy'd their helms 'Mid brakes and boughs trench'd in the heath below, Where like a nest of night-worms did they glitter, Sprinkling the plain with brightness. On I sped With silent step, yet oft did pass so near, 'Twas next to prodigy I 'scap'd unseen. CHORUS. Their number, Prince? ARVIRAGUS. Few, if mine hasty eye Did find, and count them all. CHORUS. Oh brethren, brethren, Treason and sacrilege, worse foes than Rome, Have led Rome hither. Instant seize that wretch, And bring him to our presence. CHORUS, ELIDURUS, ARVIRAGUS. CHORUS. Say, thou false one! What doom befits the slave who sells his country? ELIDURUS. Death, sudden death! CHORUS. No, ling'ring piece-meal death; And to such death thy brother and thyself We now devote. Villain, thy deeds are known; 'Tis known, ye led the impious Romans hither To slaughter us ev'n on our holy altars. ELIDURUS. That on my soul doth lie some secret grief These looks perforce will tell: It is not fear, Druids, it is not fear that shakes me thus; The great gods know it is not: Ye can never: For, what though wisdom lifts ye next those gods, Ye cannot, like to them, unlock men's breasts, And read their inmost thoughts. Ah! that ye could. ARVIRAGUS. What hast thou done? ELIDURUS. What, Prince, I will not tell. CHORUS. Wretch, there are means— ELIDURUS. I know, and terrible means; And 'tis both fit, that you should try those means, And I endure them: Yet I think my patience Will for some space baffle your torturing fury. CHORUS. Be that best known, when our inflicted goads Harrow thy flesh! ARVIRAGUS. Stranger, ere this is try'd Confess the whole of thy black perfidy; So black, that when I look upon thy youth, Read thy mild eye, and mark thy modest brow, I think indeed, thou durst not. ELIDURUS. Such a crime Indeed I durst not; and would rather be The very wretch thou seest. I'll speak no more. CHORUS. Brethren, 'tis so. The Virgin's thoughts were just: This youth has been deceiv'd. ELIDURUS. Yes, one word more. You say, the Romans have invaded Mona. Give me a sword and twenty honest Britons, And I will quell those Romans. Vain demand! Alas! you cannot: ye are men of peace: Religion's self forbids. Lead then to torture. ARVIRAGUS. Now on my soul this youth doth move me much. CHORUS. Think not religion and our holy office Doth teach us tamely, like the bleating lamb, To crouch before oppression, and with neck Outstretch'd await the stroke. Mistaken boy! Did not strict justice claim thee for her victim, We might full safely send thee to these Romans, Inviting their hot charge. Know, when I blow That sacred trumpet bound with sable fillets To yonder branching oak, the awful sound Calls forth a thousand Britons train'd alike In holy and in martial exercise, Not by such mode and rule, as Romans use, But of that fierce portentous horrible sort, As shall appall ev'n Romans. ELIDURUS. Gracious gods! Then there are hopes indeed. Oh call them instant, This Prince will lead them on: I'll follow him, Though in my chains, and some way dash them round To harm the haughty foe. ARVIRAGUS. A thousand Britons, And arm'd! Oh instant blow the sacred trump, And let me head them. Yet methinks this youth— CHORUS. I know what thou wouldst say, might join thee, Prince. True, were he free from crime, or had confest. ELIDURUS. Confest. Ah, think not, I will e'er— ARVIRAGUS. Reflect. Either thyself or brother must have wrong'd us: Then why conceal— ELIDURUS. Hast thou a brother? no! Else hadst thou spar'd the word; and yet a sister Lovely as thine might more than teach thee, Prince, What 'tis to have a brother. Hear me, Druids, Though I would prize an hour of freedom now Before an age of any after date: Though I would seize it as the gift of Heav'n, And use it as Heav'n's gift: yet do not think, I so will purchase it. Give it me freely, I yet will spurn the boon, and hug my chains, 'Till you do swear by your own hoary heads, My brother shall be safe. CHORUS. Excellent youth! Thy words do speak thy soul, and such a soul, As 'wakes our wonder. Thou art free; thy brother Shall be thine honour's pledge! so will we use him, As thou art false or true. ELIDURUS. I ask no other. ARVIRAGUS. Thus then, my fellow soldier, to thy clasp I give the hand of friendship. Noble youth, We'll speed, or die together. CHORUS. Hear us, Prince! Mona permits not, that he fights her battles, 'Till duly purified: For though his soul Took up unwittingly this deed of baseness, Yet is lustration meet. Learn, that in vice There is a noisome rankness unperceiv'd By gross corporeal sense, which so offends Heav'n's pure divinities, as us the stench Of vapour wafted from sulphureous pool, Or pois'nous weed obscene. Hence doth the man, Who ev'n converses with a villain, need As much purgation, as the pallid wretch 'Scap'd from the walls, where frowning Pestilence Spreads wide her livid banners. For this cause, Ye priests, conduct the youth to yonder grove, And do the needful rites. Mean while ourself Will lead thee, Prince, unto thy father's presence.— But hold, the King comes forth. [Exeunt Priests with Elidurus. CARACTACUS, ARVIRAGUS, CHORUS, EVELINA. CARACTACUS. My son, my son! What joy, what transport, doth thine aged sire Feel in these filial foldings! Speak not, boy, Nor interrupt that heart-felt ecstacy Should strike us mute. I know what thou wouldst say, Yet prithee, peace. Thy sister's voice hath clear'd thee, And could excuse find words at this blest moment, Trust me, I'd give it vent. But 'tis enough, Thy father welcomes thee to him and honour: Honour, that now with rapt'rous certainty Calls thee his own true offspring. Dost thou weep? Ah, if thy tears swell not from joy's free spring, I beg thee spare them; I have done thee wrong, Can make thee no atonement: None, alas! Thy father scarce can bless thee, as he ought; Unblest himself, beset with foes around, Bereft of queen, of kingdom, and of soldiers, He can but give thee portion of his dangers, Perchance and of his chains: Yet droop not, boy, Virtue is still thine own. ARVIRAGUS. It is, my father; Pure as from thine illustrious fount it came: And that unsullied, let the world oppress us; Let Fraud and Falsehood rivet fetters on us; Still shall our souls be free: Yet hope is ours, As well as virtue. CARACTACUS. Spoken like a Briton. True, hope is ours, and therefore let's prepare: The moments now are precious. Tell us, Druid, Is it not meet, we see the bands drawn out, And mark their due array? CHORUS. Monarch, ev'n now They skirt the grove. CARACTACUS. Then let us to their front— CHORUS. But is the traitor youth in safety lodg'd? CARACTACUS. Druid, he fled— CHORUS. Oh fatal flight to Mona! CARACTACUS. But what of that? Arviragus is here, My son is here, let then the traitor go, By this he has join'd the Romans: Let him join them; A single arm, and that a villain's arm, Can lend but little aid to any powers Oppos'd to truth and virtue. Come, my son, Let's to the troops, and marshal them with speed. That done, we from these venerable men Will claim their ready blessing: Then to battle; And the swift sun ev'n at his purple dawn Shall spy us crown'd with conquest, or with death. [Exeunt Caractacus and Arviragus. CHORUS, EVELINA. CHORUS. What may his flight portend! Say, Evelina, How came this youth to 'scape? EVELINA. And that to tell Will fix much blame on my impatient folly: For, ere your hallow'd lips had given permission, I flew with eager haste to bear my father News of his son's return. Inflam'd with that, Think, how a sister's zealous breast must glow? Your looks give mild assent. I glow'd indeed With the dear tale, and sped me in his ear To pour the precious tidings: But my tongue Scarce nam'd Arviragus, ere the false stranger (As I bethink me since) with stealthy pace Fled to the cavern's mouth. CHORUS. The king pursu'd? EVELINA. Alas! he mark'd him not, for 'twas the moment, When he had all to ask and all to fear, Touching my brother's valour. Hitherto His safety only, which but little mov'd him, Had reach'd his ears: But when my tongue unfolded The story of his bravery and his peril, Oh how the tears cours'd plenteous down his cheeks! How did he lift unto the heav'ns his hands In speechless transport! Yet he soon bethought him Of Rome's invasion, and with fiery glance Survey'd the cavern round; then snatch'd his spear, And menac'd to pursue the flying traitor: But I with prayers (Oh pardon, if they err'd) Withheld his step, for to the left the youth Had wing'd his way, where the thick underwood Afforded sure retreat. Besides, if found, Was age a match for youth? CHORUS. Maiden, enough; Better perchance for us, if he were captive: But in the justice of their cause, and Heav'n, Do Mona's sons confide. BARD, CHORUS, ELIDURUS, EVELINA. BARD. Druid, the rites Are finish'd, all save that which crowns the rest, And which pertains to thy blest hand alone; For that he kneels before thee. CHORUS. Take him hence, We may not trust him forth to fight our cause. ELIDURUS. Now by Andraste's throne— CHORUS. Nay, swear not, Youth, The tie is broke, that held thy fealty: Thy brother's fled. ELIDURUS. Fled! CHORUS. To the Romans fled; Yes, thou hast cause to tremble. ELIDURUS. Ah, Vellinus! Does thus our love, does thus our friendship end! Was I thy brother, Youth, and hast thou left me! Yes; and how left me, cruel as thou art, The victim of thy crimes! CHORUS. True, thou must die. ELIDURUS. I pray ye then on your best mercy, Fathers, It may be speedy. I would fain be dead, If this be life. Yet I must doubt ev'n that; For falsehood of this strange stupendous sort Sets firm-ey'd Reason on a gaze, mistrusting, That what she sees in palpable plain form, The stars in yon blue arch, these woods, these caverns, Are all mere tricks of cozenage, nothing real, The vision of a vision. If he's fled, I ought to hate this brother. CHORUS. Yet thou dost not. ELIDURUS. But when astonishment will give me leave, Perchance I shall.—And yet he is my brother, And he was virtuous once. Yes, ye vile Romans, Yes, I must die, before my thirsty sword Drinks one rich drop of vengeance. Yet, ye robbers, Yet will I curse you with my dying lips: 'Twas you, that stole away my brother's virtue. CHORUS. Now then prepare to die. ELIDURUS. I am prepar'd. Yet, since I cannot now (what most I wish'd) By manly prowess guard this lovely maid: Permit that on your holiest earth I kneel, And pour one fervent prayer for her protection. Allow me this, for though you think me false, The gods will hear me. EVELINA. I can hold no longer! Oh Druid, Druid, at thy feet I fall: Yes, I must plead, (away with virgin-blushes) For such a youth must plead. I'll die to save him, Oh take my life, and let him fight for Mona. CHORUS. Virgin, arise. His virtue hath redeem'd him, And he shall fight for thee and for his country. Youth, thank us with thy deeds. The time is short, And now with reverence take our high lustration: Thrice do we sprinkle thee with day-break dew Shook from the May-thorn blossom; twice and thrice Touch we thy forehead with our holy wand: Now thou art fully purg'd. Now rise restor'd To virtue and to us. Hence then, my son, Hie thee to yonder altar, where our Bards Shall arm thee duly both with helm and sword For warlike enterprise. [Exit Elidurus. CARACTACUS, CHORUS, ARVIRAGUS, EVELINA. CARACTACUS. 'Tis true, my Son, Bold are their bearings, and I fear me not But they have hearts will not belie their looks. I like them well. Yet would to righteous Heav'n Those valiant veterans, that on Snowdon guard Their scanty pittance of bleak liberty, Were here to join them; we would teach these wolves, Though we permit their rage to prowl our coasts, That vengeance 'waits them ere they rob our altars. Hail, Druid, hail! we find thy valiant guards Accoutred so, as well bespeaks the wisdom That fram'd their phalanx. We but wait thy blessing To lead them 'gainst the foe. CHORUS. Caractacus! Behold this sword: The sword of old Belinus, Stain'd with the blood of giants, and its name Trifingus. Many an age its charmed blade Has slept within yon consecrated trunk. Lo, I unsheath it, King; I wave it o'er thee; Mark, what portentous streams of scarlet light Flow from the brandish'd falchion. On thy knee Receive the sacred pledge.—And mark our words, By the bright circle of the golden sun, By the brief courses of the errant moon, By the dread potency of every star That studs the mystic zodiac's burning girth, By each, and all of these supernal signs, We do adjure thee, with this trusty blade, To guard yon central oak, whose holiest stem Involves the spirit of high Taranis: This be thy charge; to which in aid we join Ourselves, and our sage brethren. With our vassals Thy son and the Brigantian prince shall make Incursion on the foe. CARACTACUS. In this, and all, Be ours observance meet. Yet surely, Druid, The fresh and active vigour of these youths Might better suit with this important charge. Not that my heart shrinks at the glorious task, But will with ready zeal pour forth its blood Upon the sacred roots, my firmest courage Might fail to save. Yet, Fathers, I am old; And if I fell the foremost in the onset, Should leave a son behind, might still defend you. CHORUS. The sacred adjuration we have utter'd May never be recall'd, CARACTACUS. Then be it so. But do not think, I counsel this through fear: Old as I am, I trust with half our powers I could drive back these Romans to their ships; Dastards, that come as doth the cow'ring fowler To tangle me with snares, and take me tamely: Slaves, they shall find, that ere they gain their prey, They have to hunt it boldly with barb'd spears, And meet such conflict, as the chafed boar Gives to his stout assailants. Oh ye gods! That I might instant face them. CHORUS. Be thy son's The onset. ARVIRAGUS. From his soul that son doth thank ye, Blessing the wisdom, that preserves his father Thus to the last. Oh if the fav'ring gods Direct this arm, if their high will permit I pour a prosperous vengeance on the foe, I ask for life no longer, than to crown The valiant task. Steel then, ye Powers of heav'n, Steel my firm soul with your own fortitude, Free from alloy of passion. Give me courage, That knows not rage; revenge, that knows not malice; Let me not thirst for carnage, but for conquest: And conquest gain'd, sleep vengeance in my breast, Ere in its sheath my sword. CARACTACUS. Oh hear his father! If ever rashness spurr'd me on, great gods, To acts of danger thirsting for renown; If e'er my eager soul pursu'd its course Beyond just reason's limit, visit not My faults on him. I am the thing you made me; Vindictive, bold, precipitate, and fierce: But as you gave to him a milder mind, Oh bless him, bless him with a milder fate! EVELINA. Nor yet unheard let Evelina pour Her pray'rs and tears. Oh hear a hapless maid, That ev'n through half the years her life has number'd, Ev'n nine long years has dragg'd a trembling being, Beset with pains and perils. Give her peace; And, to endear it more, be that blest peace Won by her brother's sword. Oh bless his arm, And bless his valiant followers, one, and all. ELIDURUS entering armed. Hear, Heav'n! and let this pure and virgin pray'r Plead ev'n for Elidurus, whose sad soul Cannot look up to your immortal thrones, And urge his own request: Else would he ask, That all the dangers of th' approaching fight Might fall on him alone: That every spear The Romans wield might at his breast be aim'd; Each arrow darted on his rattling helm; That so the brother of this beauteous maid, Returning safe with victory and peace, Might bear them to her bosom. CHORUS. Now rise all; And Heav'n, that knows what most ye ought to ask, Grant all ye ought to have. Behold, the stars Are faded; universal darkness reigns. Now is the dreadful hour, now will our torches Glare with more livid horror, now our shrieks And clanking arms will more appal the foe. But heed, ye Bards, that for the sign of onset Ye sound the ancientest of all your rhymes, Whose birth tradition notes not, nor who fram'd Its lofty strains: The force of that high air Did Julius feel, when, fir'd by it, our fathers First drove him recreant to his ships; and ill Had far'd his second landing, but that fate Silenc'd the master Bard, who led the song. Now forth, brave pair! Go, with our blessing go; Mute be the march, as ye ascend the hill: Then, when ye hear the sound of our shrill trumpet, Fall on the foe. CARACTACUS. Now glory be thy guide; Pride of my soul, go forth and conquer. EVELINA. Brother, Yet one embrace. Oh thou much-honour'd stranger, I charge thee fight by my dear brother's side, And shield him from the foe; for he is brave, And will with bold and well-directed arm Return thy succour. [Exeunt Arviragus and Elidurus. CHORUS. Now, ye priests, with speed Strew on the altar's height your sacred leaves, And light the morning flame. But why is this? Why doth our brother Mador snatch his harp From yonder bough? Why this way bend his step? CARACTACUS. He is entranc'd. The fillet bursts, that bound His liberal locks; his snowy vestments fall In ampler folds; and all his floating form Doth seem to glisten with divinity! Yet is he speechless. Say, thou chief of Bards, What is there in this airy vacancy, That thou with fiery and irregular glance Should'st scan thus wildly? wherefore heaves thy breast? Why starts— CHORUS. ODE. I. 1. Hark! heard ye not yon footstep dread, That shook the earth with thund'ring tread? 'Twas Death.—In haste The warrior past; High tower'd his helmed head: I mark'd his mail, I mark'd his shield, I 'spy'd the sparkling of his spear, I saw his giant arm the falchion wield; Wide wav'd the bick'ring blade, and fir'd the angry air. I. 2. On me (he cry'd) my Britons, wait, To lead you to the field of fate I come: Yon car, That cleaves the air, Descends to throne my state: I mount, your champion and your god. My proud steeds neigh beneath the thong: Hark! to my wheels of brass, that rattle loud! Hark! to my clarion Here one of the Druids blows the sacred trumpet. shrill, that brays the woods among! I. 3. Fear not now the fever's fire, Fear not now the death-bed groan, Pangs that torture, pains that tire, Bed-rid age with feeble moan: These domestic terrors wait Hourly at my palace gate; And when o'er slothful realms my rod I wave, These on the tyrant king and coward slave Rush with vindictive rage, and drag them to their grave. II. 1. But ye, my sons, at this high hour Shall share the fulness of my power: From all your bows, In levell'd rows, My own dread shafts shall shower. Go then to conquest, gladly go, Deal forth my dole of destiny, With all my fury dash the trembling foe Down to those darksome dens, where Rome's pale spectres lie. II. 2. Where creeps the ninefold stream profound Her black inexorable round, And on the bank, To willows dank, The shiv'ring ghosts are bound. Twelve thousand crescents all shall swell To full-orb'd pride, and fading die, Ere they again in life's gay mansions dwell: Not such the meed that crowns the sons of liberty. II. 3. No, my Britons! battle-slain, Rapture gilds your parting hour: I, that all despotic reign, Claim but there a moment's power. Swiftly the soul of British flame Animates some kindred frame, Swiftly to life and light triumphant flies, Exults again in martial ecstasies, Again for freedom fights, again for freedom dies. CARACTACUS. It does, it does! unconquer'd, undismay'd, The British soul revives—Champion, lead on, I follow—give me way. Some blessed shaft Will rid me of this clog of cumb'rous age; And I again shall in some happier mould Rise to redeem my country. CHORUS. Stay thee, Prince, And mark what clear and amber-skirted clouds Rise from the altar's verge, and cleave the skies: Oh 'tis a prosperous omen! Soon expect To hear glad tidings. CARACTACUS. I will send them to thee. CHORUS. But see, a Bard approaches, and he bears them: Else is his eye no herald to his heart. BARD, CHORUS, CARACTACUS. CARACTACUS. Speedily tell thy tale. BARD. A tale like mine, I trust your ears will willingly pursue Through each glad circumstance. First, Monarch, learn, The Roman troop is fled. CHORUS. Great gods, we thank ye! CARACTACUS. Fought they not ere they fled? Oh tell me all. BARD. Silent, as night, that wrapt us in her veil, We pac'd up yonder hill, whose woody ridge O'erhung the ambush'd foe. No sound was heard, Step felt, or sight descry'd: for safely hid, Beneath the purple pall of sacrifice Did sleep our holy fire, nor saw the air, Till to that pass we came, where whilom Brute Planted his five hoar altars. To our rites Then swift we hasted, and in one short moment The rocky piles were cloth'd with livid flame. Near each a white-rob'd Druid, whose stern voice Thunder'd deep execrations on the foe. Now wak'd our horrid symphony, now all Our harps terrific rang: Meanwhile the grove Trembled, the altars shook, and through our ranks Our sacred sisters rush'd in sable robes, With hair dishevell'd, and funereal brands Hurl'd round with menacing fury. On they rush'd In fierce and frantic mood, as is their wont Amid the magic rites, they do to Night In their deep dens below. Motions like these Were never dar'd before in open air! CHORUS. Did I not say, we had a pow'r within us. That might appall ev'n Romans? BARD. And it did. They stood aghast, and to our vollied darts, That thick as hail fell on their helms and corslets, Scarce rais'd a warding shield. The sacred trumpet Then rent the air, and instant at the signal Rush'd down Arviragus with all our vassals; A hot, but short-liv'd, conflict then ensu'd: For soon they fled. I saw the Romans fly, Before I left the field. CARACTACUS. My son pursu'd? BARD. The prince and Elidurus, like twin lions, Did side by side engage. Death seem'd to guide Their swords, no stroke fell fruitless, every wound Gave him a victim. CARACTACUS. Thus my friend Ebrancus! Ill-fated Prince! didst thou and I in youth Unite our valours. In his prime he fell, On Conway's banks I saw him fall, and slew His murderer.—But how far did they pursue? BARD. Ev'n to the ships: For I descry'd the rout, Far as the twilight gleam would aid my sight. CARACTACUS. Now, thanks to the bright star that rul'd his birth; Yes, he will soon return to claim my blessing, And he shall have it pour'd in tears of joy On his bold breast! methought I heard a step: Is it not his? BARD. 'Tis some of our own train, And as I think, they lead six Romans captive. CHORUS, CARACTACUS, CAPTIVES. CHORUS. My brethren, bear the prisoners to the cavern, 'Till we demand them. CARACTACUS. Pause ye yet awhile. They seem of bold demeanour, and have helms, That speak them leaders. Hear me, Romans, hear. That you are captives, is the chance of war: Yet captives as ye are, in Britain's eye Ye are not slaves. Barbarians though ye call us, We know the native rights man claims from man, And therefore never shall we gall your necks With chains, or drag you at our scythed cars In arrogance of triumph. Nor 'till taught By Rome (what Britain sure should scorn to learn) Her avarice, will we barter you for gold. True, ye are captives, and our country's safety Forbids we give you back to liberty: We give you therefore to the immortal gods, To them we lift you in the radiant cloud Of sacrifice. They may in limbs of freedom Replace your free-born souls, and their high mercy Haply shall to some better world advance you; Or else in this restore that golden gift, Which lost, leaves life a burden. Does there breathe A wretch so pall'd with the vain fear of death Can call this cruelty? 'tis love, 'tis mercy; And grant, ye gods, if e'er I'm made a captive, I meet the like fair treatment from the foe, Whose stronger star quells mine. Now lead them on, And, while they live, treat them, as men should men, And not as Rome treats Britain. [Exeunt Captives. Druid, these, Ev'n should their chief escape, may to the gods Be given in sacrifice. CHORUS. O think not, King, That Mona shall be curst by these dire rites. Ev'n from the youth of Time yon holy altar Has held the place thou seest; ages on ages Have there done sacrifice: but never yet Stream'd it with human gore, nor ever shall While we hold office here. 'Tis true, that Gaul, True too that Briton, by the Gauls mistaught, Have done such deeds of horror; deeds, that shock'd Humanity, and call'd from angry Heav'n These curses on our country. CARACTACUS. Can the gods Behold a sight more grateful, than the flame, That blasts impiety? CHORUS. Admit they cannot: Need they the hand of man to light that flame? Have not those gods their lightning? Taranis Doth he not wield the thunder? CARACTACUS. Holy Druid, I stand rebuk'd: Will ye then pardon them? CHORUS. We say not that. Vengeance shall have her course, But Vengeance in her own peculiar garb, Not in the borrow'd weeds of sage Religion: They suit not her.—Whence was that shriek? EVELINA, CARACTACUS, CHORUS. EVELINA. My Father, Support me, take me trembling to your arms; All is not well. Ah me, my fears o'ercome me! CARACTACUS. What means my child? EVELINA. Alas! we are betray'd. Ev'n now as wand'ring in yon eastern grove I call'd the gods to aid us, the dread sound Of many hasty steps did meet mine ear: This way they prest. CARACTACUS. Daughter, thy fears are vain. EVELINA. Methought I saw the flame of lighted brands, And what did glitter to my dazzled sight Like swords and helms. CARACTACUS. All, all the feeble coinage Of maiden fear. EVELINA. Nay, if mine ear mistook not, I heard the traitor's voice, who that way 'scap'd, Calling to arms. CARACTACUS. Away with idle terrors! Know, thy brave brother's helm is crown'd with conquest, Our foes are fled, their leaders are our captives. Smile, my lov'd child, and imitate the sun, That rises ruddy from behind yon oaks, To hail him victor. CHORUS. That the rising sun! Oh horror! horror! sacrilegious fires Devour our groves: they blaze, they blaze! Oh sound The trump again; recall the Prince, or all Is lost. CARACTACUS. Druid, where is thy fortitude? Do not I live? Is not this holy sword Firm in my grasp? I will preserve your groves. Britons, I go: Let those that dare die nobly, Follow my step. [Exit Caractacus. EVELINA. Oh whither does he go? Return, return: Ye holy men, recall him. What is his arm against a host of Romans? Oh I have lost a father! CHORUS. Ruthless gods! Ye take away our souls: A general panic Reigns thro' the grove. Oh fly, my brethren, fly To aid the king, fly to preserve your altars! Alas! 'tis all in vain; our fate is fixt. Look there, look there, thou miserable Maid! Behold thy bleeding brother. ARVIRAGUS, ELIDURUS, EVELINA, CHORUS. ARVIRAGUS. Thanks, good Youth! Safe hast thou brought me to that holy spot, Where I did wish to die. Support me still. Oh, I am sick to death. Yet one step more: Now lay me gently down. I would drag out This life, though at some cost of throbs and pangs, Just long enough to claim my father's blessing, And sigh my last breath in my sister's arms.— And here she kneels, poor maid! all dumb with grief. Restrain thy sorrow, gentlest Evelina. True, thou dost see me bleed: I bleed to death. EVELINA. Say'st thou to death? Oh gods! the barbed shaft Is buried in his breast. Yes, he must die; And I, alas! am doom'd to see him die. Where are your healing arts, medicinal herbs, Ye holy men, your wonder-working spells? Pluck me but out this shaft, stanch but this blood, And I will call down blessings on your heads With such a fervency—And can ye not! Then let me beg you on my bended knee, Give to my misery some opiate drug, May shut up all my senses.—Yes, good Fathers, Mingle the potion so, that it may kill me Just at the instant, this poor languisher Heaves his last sigh. ARVIRAGUS. Talk not thus wildly, Sister, Think on our father's age— EVELINA. Alas! my Brother! We have no father now; or if we have, He is a captive. ARVIRAGUS. Captive! Oh my wound! It stings me now—But is it so! [Turning to the Chorus. CHORUS. Alas! We know no more, save that he sallied single To meet the foe, whose unexpected host Round by the east had wound their fraudful march, And fir'd our groves. ELIDURUS. Oh fatal, fatal valour! Then is he seiz'd, or slain. ARVIRAGUS. Too sure he is! Druid, not half the Romans met our swords; We found the fraud too late: the rest are yonder. CHORUS. How could they gain the pass? ARVIRAGUS. The wretch, that fled That way, return'd, conducting half their powers; And—But thy pardon, Youth, I will not wound thee, He is thy brother. ELIDURUS. Thus my honest sword Shall force the blood from the detested heart, That holds alliance with him. ARVIRAGUS. Elidurus, Hold, on our friendship, hold. Thou noble Youth, Look on this innocent maid. She must to Rome, Captive to Rome. Thou see'st warm life flow from me, Ere long she'll have no brother. Heav'n's my witness, I do not wish, that thou shouldst live the slave Of Rome: But yet she is my sister. ELIDURUS. Prince! Thou urgest that, might make me drag an age In fetters worse than Roman. I will live, And while I live— Enter BARD. Fly to your caverns, Druids, The grove's beset around. The chief approaches. CHORUS. Let him approach, we will confront his pride; The Seer that rules amid the groves of Mona Has not to fear his fury. What tho' age Slacken our sinews; what tho' shield and sword Give not their iron aid to guard our body; Yet virtue arms our soul, and 'gainst that panoply What 'vails the rage of robbers? Let him come. ARVIRAGUS. I faint apace.—Ye venerable men, If ye can save this body from pollution, If ye can tomb me in this sacred place, I trust ye will. I fought to save these groves, And, fruitless tho' I fought, some grateful oak, I trust, will spread its reverential gloom O'er my pale ashes—Ah! that pang was death! My sister, Oh!— [Dies. ELIDURUS. She faints! Ah raise her!— EVELINA. Yes, Now he is dead. I felt his spirit go In a cold sigh, and as it past, methought It paus'd awhile, and trembled on my lips! Take me not from him: Breathless as he is, He is my brother still, and if the gods Do please to grace him with some happier being, They ne'er can give to him a fonder sister. CHORUS. Brethren, surround the corse, and, ere the foe Approaches, chant with meet solemnity That grateful dirge your dying champion claims. SEMICHORUS. Lo, where incumbent o'er the shade Rome's rav'ning eagle bows her beaked head! Yet while a moment fate affords, While yet a moment freedom stays, That moment, which outweighs Eternity's unmeasur'd hoards, Shall Mona's grateful Bards employ To hymn their godlike hero to the sky. SEMICHORUS. Ring out, ye mortal strings; Answer, thou heav'nly harp, instinct with spirit all, That o'er the jasper arch self-warbling swings Of blest Andraste's throne: Thy sacred sounds alone Can celebrate the fall Of bold Arviragus— [Enter Aulus Didius and Romans. AULUS DIDIUS, CHORUS, EVELINA, ELIDURUS. AULUS DIDIUS. Ye bloody Priests, Behold we burst on your infernal rites, And bid you pause. Instant restore our soldiers, Nor hope that Superstition's ruthless step Shall wade in Roman gore. Ye savage men, Did not our laws give license to all faiths, We would o'erturn your altars, headlong heave These shapeless symbols of your barbarous gods, And let the golden sun into your caves. CHORUS. Servant of Cæsar, has thine impious tongue Spent the black venom of its blasphemy? It has. Then take our curses on thine head, Ev'n his fell curses, who doth reign in Mona, Vicegerent of those gods thy pride insults. AULUS DIDIUS. Bold Priest, I scorn thy curses, and thyself. Soldiers, go search the caves, and free the prisoners. Take heed, ye seize Caractacus alive. Arrest yon youth; load him with heaviest irons, He shall to Cæsar answer for his crime. ELIDURUS. I stand prepar'd to triumph in my crime. AULUS DIDIUS. 'Tis well, proud Boy—Look to the beauteous maid, [To the Soldiers. That tranc'd in grief, bends o'er yon bleeding corse, Respect her sorrows. EVELINA. Hence, ye barbarous men, Ye shall not take him welt'ring thus in blood, To show at Rome what British virtue was. Avaunt! The breathless body that ye touch Was once Arviragus! AULUS DIDIUS. Fear us not, Princess, We reverence the dead. CHORUS. Would too to Heav'n, Ye reverenc'd the gods but ev'n enough Not to debase with slavery's cruel chain, What they created free. AULUS DIDIUS. The Romans fight Not to enslave, but humanize the world. CHORUS. Go to, we will not parley with thee, Roman: Instant pronounce our doom. AULUS DIDIUS. Hear it, and thank us. This once our clemency shall spare your groves, If at our call ye yield the British King: Yet learn, when next ye aid the foes of Cæsar, That each old oak, whose solemn gloom ye boast, Shall bow beneath our axes. CHORUS. Be they blasted, Whene'er their shade forgets to shelter virtue. Enter BARD. Mourn, Mona, mourn. Caractacus is captive! And dost thou smile, false Roman? Do not think He fell an easy prey. Know, ere he yielded, Thy bravest veterans bled. He too, thy spy, The base Brigantian Prince, hath seal'd his fraud With death. Bursting thro' armed ranks, that hemm'd The caitiff round, the brave Caractacus Seiz'd his false throat; and as he gave him death, Indignant thunder'd, ‘Thus is my last stroke ‘The stroke of justice.’ Numbers then opprest him: I saw the slave, that cowardly behind Pinion'd his arms; I saw the sacred sword Writh'd from his grasp: I saw, what now ye see, Inglorious sight! those barbarous bonds upon him. CARACTACUS, AULUS DIDIUS, CHORUS, &amp;c. CARACTACUS. Romans, methinks the malice of your tyrant Might furnish heavier chains. Old as I am, And wither'd as you see these war-worn limbs, Trust me, they shall support the weightiest load Injustice dares impose.— Proud-crested soldier! [To Didius. Who seem'st the master-mover in this business, Say, dost thou read less terror on my brow, Than when thou met'st me in the fields of war Heading my nations? No, my free-born soul Has scorn still left to sparkle through these eyes, And frown defiance on thee.—Is it thus! [Seeing his Son's body. Then I'm indeed a captive. Mighty gods! My soul, my soul submits: Patient it bears The pond'rous load of grief ye heap upon it. Yes, it will grovel in this shatter'd breast, And be the sad tame thing it ought to be, Coopt in a servile body. AULUS DIDIUS. Droop not, King. When Claudius, the great master of the world, Shall hear the noble story of thy valour, His pity— CARACTACUS. Can a Roman pity, Soldier? And if he can, gods! must a Briton bear it? Arviragus, my bold, my breathless boy, Thou hast escap'd such pity; thou art free. Here in high Mona shall thy noble limbs Rest in a noble grave; posterity Shall to thy tomb with annual reverence bring Sepulchral stones, and pile them to the clouds: Whilst mine— AULUS DIDIUS. The morn doth hasten our departure. Prepare thee, King, to go: A fav'ring gale Now swells our sails. CARACTACUS. Inhuman that thou art! Dost thou deny a moment for a father To shed a few warm tears o'er his dead son? I tell thee, Chief, this act might claim a life, To do it duly; even a longer life, Than sorrow ever suffer'd. Cruel man! And thou deny'st me moments. Be it so. I know you Romans weep not for your children; Ye triumph o'er your tears, and think it valour: I triumph in my tears. Yes, best-lov'd Boy, Yes, I can weep, can fall upon thy corse, And I can tear my hairs, these few gray hairs, The only honours war and age hath left me. Ah, Son! thou might'st have rul'd o'er many nations, As did thy royal ancestry: But I, Rash that I was, ne'er knew the golden curb Discretion hangs on brav'ry: Else perchance These men, that fasten fetters on thy father, Had sued to him for peace, and claim'd his friendship. AULUS DIDIUS. But thou wast still implacable to Rome, And scorn'd her friendship. CARACTACUS starting up from the Body. Soldier, I had arms, Had neighing steeds to whirl my iron cars, Had wealth, dominion. Dost thou wonder, Roman, I fought to save them? What, if Cæsar aims, To lord it universal o'er the world, Shall the world tamely crouch at Cæsar's footstool? AULUS DIDIUS. Read in thy fate our answer. Yet if sooner Thy pride had yielded— CARACTACUS. Thank thy gods, I did not. Had it been so, the glory of thy master, Like my misfortunes, had been short and trivial, Oblivion's ready prey: Now after struggling Nine years, and that right bravely 'gainst a tyrant, I am his slave, to treat as seems him good; If cruelly, 'twill be an easy task To bow a wretch, alas! how bow'd already! Down to the dust: If well, his clemency, When trick'd and varnish'd by your glossing penmen, Will shine in honour's annals, and adorn Himself; it boots not me. Look there, look there, The slave that shot that dart, kill'd ev'ry hope Of lost Caractacus! Arise, my daughter. Alas! poor Prince; art thou too in vile fetters? [To Elidurus. Come hither, youth: Be thou to me a son, To her a brother. Thus with trembling arms I lead you forth; Children, we go to Rome. Weep'st thou, my Girl? I prithee hoard thy tears For the sad meeting of thy captive mother: For we have much to tell her, much to say Of these good men, who nurtur'd us in Mona; Much of the fraud and malice, that pursu'd us; Much of her son, who pour'd his precious blood To save his sire and sister: Think'st thou, Maid, Her gentleness can hear the tale and live? And yet she must. Oh gods, I grow a talker! Grief and old age are ever full of words: But I'll be mute. Adieu! ye holy men; Yet one look more—Now lead us hence for ever. ARGENTILE AND CURAN: A LEGENDARY DRAMA. IN FIVE ACTS. WRITTEN ON THE OLD ENGLISH MODEL. ABOUT THE YEAR 1766. This is nor Comedy nor Tragedy Nor Historie. Beaumont and Fletcher's Prologue to the Captain. PERSONS REPRESENTED. MEN.King Adelbright, Joint Sovereign of Bernicia and Dëira. King Edel, Joint Sovereign of Bernicia and Dëira. Curan, Prince of Denmark. Sewold, the Danish Envoy. Oswald, a Saxon Earl. Edwin, his Son. The Prior of Whitby Abbey. Two Saxon Lords. The King's Falconer. Ralph, his Deputy. A Danish Officer. Monks and Nuns of Whitby Abbey, Attendants, &amp;c. WOMEN. Argentile, Daughter of King Adelbright. Editha, her Attendant. The Scene, some time in and about the Castle of Whitby, afterwards in the Valley of Hackness. The Story is taken from an old narrative Poem, called Albion's England, written by W. Warner, and it is to be found in Dr. Percy's Reliques of ancient English Poetry, Vol. II. p. 233, first edition; but is here much more altered, than was customary with our old Dramatists. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text. The abbreviations used for major characters are as follows: For Ad. read King Adelbright; For Ed. read King Edel or Editha or Edwin; For Arg. read Argentile; For Osw. read Oswald; For Sew. read Sewold; For Cur. read Curan; For Fal. read Falconer. ACT I. SCENE I. The great Hall in the Castle of Whitby. Enter a solemn Procession of the Prior, Monks, and Sisterhood of St. Hilda's Abbey, before King Adelbright, who is borne in a Chair of State, sick; King Edel, the Princess Argentile, Lord Oswald, and other Courtiers attending. The Monks and Nuns sing the following Dirge. CHORUS. Holy Hilda! hear, and aid, While our aged King we bear To thy shrine, thou sainted Maid, Hilda holy, aid, and hear! A Monk. He, whose head a crown invested, Bows to thee that dying head; Be his truth in Heav'n attested, Holy Hilda, hear, and aid! The last line repeated in Chorus in every subsequent stanza. A Nun. He, whose hands a sceptre wielded, Lifts to thee those hands in pray'r; Be his soul from danger shielded, Hilda holy, aid, and hear! Prior. Faith doth lead him to thy altar, There his languid limbs to spread, If in prayer his accents falter, Holy Hilda, hear, and aid! A Monk. Waft to Heav'n each faint petition In seraphic accents clear; Pleas'd perform that blest commission; Hilda holy, aid, and hear! A Nun. And, when Death shall free his spirit, Snatch it from the furnace red; Bid it endless bliss inherit; Holy Hilda, hear, and aid! [The Dirge ended, King Adelbright is brought forward to the middle of the Stage.] ADELBRIGHT. Yet bear me forward; now set down your burthen; And stand, I pray ye, from me, that the air Have readier passage to my labouring breast. Ed. How fares our brother now? Ad. In sooth, King Edel, Death lays that iron mace upon this shoulder That oft has quell'd a stouter; some few hours And he will chill what little blood still creeps In these lank veins. Nay, do not weep, my sweet, My gentle Argentile; thy Father, child, Is going but to where his went before him, And whither thou, and all, when Heav'n so wills, Must follow him; yet goes he full of days, And full of, what this oft misdeeming world Calls, honour; yet, if honour'd false, I trust Still unreproach'd; for so his conscience whispers, And in a voice as soothing as the sound Of this sweet minstrelsy: Do not then weep. For tho' thy Father leaves thee, Argentile; Not fatherless he leaves thee; trust me, child, While this good man, our kingly brother, lives, Thou ne'er wilt want a father. Ed. By the rood There borne, that hallow'd rood— [Pointing to one of the Crosses borne in the Procession. Ad. No oath, King Edel, 'Twere here sworn needlessly; couldst thou be false, As sure thou canst not in some lighter cause, This, in itself, bears its own pledge of faith. For Argentile is of that courteous kind, So all made up of dove-like gentleness, The veriest churl, if brib'd to do her wrong, Would inly yearn, and, his remorseful heart Turn truant to his purpose.—Still thou weep'st— [To Argentile Arg. That do I, Sir, and must; yet not from fear (I trust my uncle gives my words belief) That he should treat me (you, Sir, with the blest) Other than kindly; yet I weep, and must, To see, what shortly I must see no more, A father, fondest of all fathers, give His dying moments to his daughter's weal. And must I lose him? Heav'n! Ad. Such is Heav'n's will; And, to its high and uncontroll'd behests, Let all like me give the prostration meet Of heart, as well as head. Yet will I own (Had it so pleas'd the giver of all good) I could have wish'd, or e'er I left thee, child, To have affixt, with my own hand, the signet Unto that nuptial treaty which consigns thee To Denmark's youthful heir; this to confirm Ev'n now an embassy is on the seas, If not within our ports. Arg. In luckless time Surely it comes; is this a time to think Of love, or marriage? Ad. Dearest Argentile, Pray thee forbear to interrupt my speech; Words now are precious to me. With thee, Brother, I leave this weighty business. Be it thine To see our daughter, with the royal dower That I have left, wedded to Denmark's heir. To which, if, on thy part, it shall thee please To add such feoffs as may beseem the worth Of fair Dëira, reign thou then sole king Of all Northumberland; and she, with dower Thus amplified by thee, shall hence to Denmark. But, if thou mak'st election still to rule With sway united, we do trust the Dane, If fame belies not his fair qualities, Will prove to thee a son, his queen thy daughter; So shall, in both, the loss be recompens'd Of us, thy loving brother. Ed. Adelbright, So mercy shield me as I rest well-pleas'd With this sweet princess, and the royal Dane, Jointly to rule Bernicia, and Dëira. Ad. We like it well; and in full proof we do, See, to thy hands we trust this peerless gem, Soul of our soul, our gentle Argentile. Now let her kneel before me, while these palms On her dear head seal my last blessing. “Hear, “Thou Virgin pure! hear, Queen of highest Heav'n, “A father's earnest prayer! O bless my child “With length of days, and not one day be dimm'd “With lack of honour! may the realm she rules, “In right of me, be blest, and she by it; “Ev'n by th' allegiance of a well-rul'd people!— Prior of Whitby, now, all that remain'd Of worldly care is finish'd; what few hours Of life are left to Heav'n we consecrate, And holy rites; bear me, my chamberlains, Unto the Abbey. Argentile, King Edel, Oswald attend us to the chauntry steps; And there farewell; then, at St. Hilda's shrine, These holy men shall spread my dying limbs, And sing my requiem; for, at that high shrine, Old Adelbright doth wish to breathe his last. [Exeunt the King borne, Edel, &amp;c. attending, the Choir repeating the Dirge. Manent two LORDS. F. Lord. Go, and Heav'n's holiest band of Saints receive thee! Go, for the goodliest piece of majesty That ever blest Dëira. Yet, methinks, Old as thou art, thou dost too hastily Make this devotement of thy soul to Heav'n. Had I been thee, ev'n to life's latest gasp This act had been delay'd, however holy; If, by such lett, fair Argentile might gain A surer tenure in her father's rights Than lip-security. S. Lord. Do others also Nourish suspicious doubts? Beshrew me, Lord, But I was giv'n to hope the yellow fiend Haunted me singly; nay, was prompt to chide My brain for giving the base inmate harbour. F. Lord. Nay, my good Lord, suspicions like to thine Be but too rife; a mean clerk he must be, Who cannot spell so much i' th' page of man As may afford him scope to comment grossly On Edel's late demeanour; and, from thence, To frame sad forecast of what soon may turn To this poor realm's mishap. This he may do, And be no prophet neither. S. Lord. Certes, Sir, Since good King Adelbright took to his chamber, His brother, vested with the double purple, Did teach that robe to puff and swell about him Ev'n to a tyrant size.—But, see, here comes Lord Oswald, and his honest eye doth borrow Enough of the hawk's keenness, I not doubt, To see as far as we do, haply further, In this black prospect. Health to noble Oswald! Enter OSWALD. Osw. Now mercy shield me, friends, from so much shriving. What with their vigils, penances, and bead-work, These priests have worn out our old master sooner Than he that made him meant. Call a physician, He'll let your soul alone; let him but plague Your body, he, good leach, rests satisfied. But, if you trust a monk with your soul's cure, Trust me, not soul alone but body pays for it. F. Lord. Shrewdly remark'd; but say, my noble Lord, How left ye the good king? Osw. Ev'n as I tell you, O'erdone with sanctity. Hast thou ne'er seen A steed of generous blood, when overweighted, Lag ere his latest stage, which, but for that, Had paced with spirit to his journey's end, And neigh'd at his ungirthing? Sirs, I left him, Just where he bade us, at the chauntry steps; The lovely princess, over-charg'd with grief, Was led in private, thro' the garden postern, Back to the castle by her now step-father. Pray Heav'n, his sex may make him 'scape the proverb. S. Lord. That little word, good Earl, which now you drop Gives us to think your fears do square with ours, Ev'n but too nicely. Osw. What, for quoting ye A thread-bare proverb! Troth a pleasant jest. What, are all step-things curst! my gallants twain, I find my tongue must wear a closer curb Whene'er I let it amble in your purlieus. S. Lord. There is no need. Osw. Nay, be there need, or not, I scarce shall have the caution. I have ever Giv'n forth my free thoughts freely, and am now Too old for closer training. Take then, Sirs, My mind unmask'd. I do indeed distrust Our now sole master, with a phlegm as fixt, As e'er a subject did. F. Lord. And I. S. Lord. And I. Osw. And many more, I trust, right honest men, Not present at our parley; for myself Thus far conceive me, I shall closely watch King Edel's 'haviour; and, if I perceive From his bleak quarter comes that blighting wind May nip the blossom'd hopes of Argentile, I'll be that broad old oak shall shield them from it. F. Lord. So doing, noble Oswald, thou wilt prove Thou hold'st the memory of our good old master As dear, as, when alive, thou held'st his person. Osw. My friends, I lov'd my good king fervently; These salt tears speak it, for they course down cheeks Not wont to find them channels, but at times When the moist dew becomes them. Nature made me Of her mixt metal, but I trust no base one, Much more of steel, than silver; yet of this Enough for honest pliancy; but not To spin me out, as wire, just as you list. For tho' you see me now like very wax, Yet, strive to mould me to a traytor shape, I'll break before I bend; thus of himself Old Oswald boasts, and, tho' himself's the boaster, He wrongs him that mistrusts him. Sirs, farewell. SCENE II. Changes to a state apartment in the Castle, enter King Edel leading in the Princess Argentile. EDEL. Enough of tears, fair Argentile, enough. Arg. Never enough, my Lord, when such the cause. Ed. If so, I fear me that the smiles will come Full tardily, which my parental fondness Shall hourly plead for. Arg. Gratitude, good uncle, Can dwell with sorrow. Nay, in that same eye, Where she sits bath'd in tears, can dart a gleam Will brighten all the face as it were joy, And yet keep weeping still. I've mark'd it oft In many a sorrowing maid, whom I have cheer'd, And wept to see it so, and that too cheer'd them. Please you, my Lord, I'll to my chamber; there Kind Editha will give that comfort to me, Which grief best loves, a sigh of sympathy. [Exit Argentile. Ed. (solus.) I much suspect me this same simple maid, Young as she is, and surely all unredde In the world's craft, doth nourish doubts within her Touching my tenderness; why, be it so; I must not for the pulings of a girl Forego my heart's high purpose; how now, Usher Enter an USHER. Ush. The Prior comes, and craves admittance, Sire. Ed. Admit him, and, as thou dost dread our frown, Ward off whate'er may interrupt our converse. [Exit Usher. Enter the PRIOR. How fares our brother now? Pri. He seems, my Sov'reign, To death no nearer now, than some hours past, Perchance, or days. He thought, as he approach'd St. Hilda's shrine, a genial heat spread o'er him Which cheer'd him much; whether the hidden powers Salubrious, that in those chaste reliques dwell, (For many have they heal'd) or whether nature, Struggling within, had gain'd some little 'vantage— Ed. I pray thee, Prior, spare me thy surmises. Thou sayest he lives, think'st thou it possible He should live long? Pri. That Heav'n's high Queen best knows; Yet, if he should, his vital force so spent, It were a miracle, and ought to bring No vulgar off'rings to our hallow'd shrine. Ed. True to his trade, I find the greedy Priest Looks out for more oblations. I have means Surer than these to wind him to my purpose. (Aside.) But give me, holy man, thy very thought Touching the nature of his malady. Pri. 'Tis seated in his breast; for lack of spring, His lungs play heavily. Ed. With such an ailment, Many have struggled long. Pri. And so may he; But the thick air, breath'd in this peopled town, Is poison in his case. The cold dense fogs, We borrow from the sea, our briny neighbour, Alike augment his danger; were he mov'd To some wide inland vale— Ed. We know thy meaning, And much approve it; but we fear, if helpt By such removal, he will ne'er be cur'd, Nor fit again to steer the helm of state. Pri. That, good my Liege, he will not. Other cares, Of weightiest import to his after peace, Have long possest him; I, and all that wish Weal to his better part, can never hope it. Ed. Good man! I think thou dost not. Pri. No, my Sov'reign, Your younger hands, helpt by your bolder head, Will abler rein a nation, so stiff-neck'd As this, that Providence now bids you rule. Ed. We know not that; we know but our good meaning, Not our ability. But this we know, That, tho' our brother was in very deed A nursing father to our holy church, We will not be behind him in that duty. Nay we will soon shew this by one bold act Which he, from feebleness of spirit, fail'd in. Pri. As how, my Liege? Ed. Mark well my words, good Prior, Thou know'st the prelate proud of Canterbury Doth hold a jurisdiction in these realms, Which, as of right, pertains to the see of York. Pri. I know, and much lament it, gracious Sir. Ed. The Pope doth favour Canterbury's claim, And mitred York submits to his behests; So did our brother too; but Edel scorns Such mean submission, and will soon depose York's recreant Bishop, and his pastoral staff, With ample powers o'er all Northumberland, Give to thy surer grasp. Pri. Your humble beadsman Is bound, for aye, to crook his aged knee— Not that I wish—to the high task unequal, Such proud advancement. What befits the weal Of holy church, you, and the saints best know. Ed. Of this enough at present. To thy care We trust our brother. But of this take heed, That none approach him, save thyself, and those Thou may'st securely trust. Spread too the rumour That he is dead, and, after fitting space, Announce his burial; he himself did chuse Private interment; this will give it credit. To-morrow, if thou find'st his health still better, Give me the news. We then will take thy council Touching his change of place. Pri. What if, my Liege, The better to relieve both soul and body, We lead him to religious solitude? His frame of mind will meet us in that matter. Ed. It may be well; we'll speak of that hereafter, But know at present this; each pious art, That makes of him a saint, makes me thy friend. Enter USHER. How now? did we not will we should be private? Ush. Sewold, ambassador from Royal Denmark, Demands an audience. Ed. He doth come full soon: Yet am I now prepar'd to give him audience. Admit the Dane. Prior, good speed to thee. [Exit Prior. [King Edel seats himself in a Chair of State; a short flourish of trumpets. Enter Sewold between two Heralds bearing on their breasts for device the Danish raven. Prince Curan in disguise enters with the rest of the train.] EDEL. My Lord Ambassador we greet you well. Yet, ere ye open your commission to us, (Of which we wot the purport) it behoves us To tell you, what the cloud upon our brow Speaks but too plain, our royal brother's dead. Sew. Landing, dread Sir, news met us of his sickness. Ed. That sickness was death's harbinger. This known, We need not add you come in luckless time, A time, which neither from the piercing grief That rends our soul, nor for the meet respect We owe his obsequies, will suffer us To turn unto that business, which from Denmark Ye have in charge. Sew. Due decency forbid, Much as my Sov'reign wishes to complete The treaty, that his envoy should, with haste Unseemly, press it. If it please your Highness, We patiently will sojourn here some days, And wait the fit occasion. Meanwhile, Sir, Think me not rude, if I request an audience Of princely Argentile, I, and my train; That, in the name of Denmark and his heir, We, to her grief, may that condolence give Our mutual loss demands. Ed. Now out, alas! Our niece is ev'n a martyr to her sorrow The lily, broken by the pelting hail, Is not more sorely shent than Argentile, Yet say it were not so, our open nature, For frankness we do hold a King's best virtue Prompts us to tell you we have scruples, Dane, Touching these nuptials; nay, for why should we Mask our true thoughts? we have much more than scruples, A well-weigh'd judgment, and by that pronounce Our niece of age too tender yet for marriage. Sew. Dread Sir, your kingly brother thought not so, But, of his own first thought, did urge the alliance To yielding Denmark. Ed. We admit he did, Yet was his daughter all averse to nuptials, And is so still. That daughter, by his death, Is now our tenderest charge. To thwart her wishes At such a time, nay, when these wishes speak With the soft voice of virgin chastity, Would ill become an uncle that reveres, And loves her virtues. Sew. Surely royal Edel— Ed. Bear with us, Lord Ambassador, we cannot Enter at full on all those weighty causes, That now oblige us to curtail your audience: Take our best thoughts in sum. On our true faith We honour Denmark much, and much do wish A firm alliance with his Sov'reignty. This to insure, we know the match in question Is a firm tye; if therefore in a year, Or rather twain, he chuses to repeat This embassy. Sew. Now by the hopes of Denmark, The Prince, his son— Ed. Is but some eighteen past, And well may give the truce, that we demand, To our young niece's coyness. This besides, Know, we have many other cogent reasons Here all unsaid, which, when our brother Denmark Is well appriz'd of, we do nothing doubt He'll praise our prudence. These, in ample sort, Soon will we set forth in a fair memorial, And send unto his court. Blame not our briefness, The weight of two wide kingdoms resting on us Must plead our full excuse. Most noble Envoy, Our seneschalls have it in charge to treat you As fits your quality; ourselves, alas, Are all unable, in our present sorrows, To give you festive greeting. Sir, commend us To royal Denmark; and a prosperous gale Spread your returning sails. [Exit Edel and train. Manent SEWOLD and CURAN. [Who comes forward hastily from the Attendants of the Embassy.] CURAN. By all my ancestors, I will not hence, till this imperious King Permit I see the Princess. Sew. Gracious Sir, Vent not in such loud tone your just displeasure, Should we be noted. Cur. Does he think that Curan, Ev'n for that honour, which he owes his country, Will bear th' indignity; not see the Princess! Tyrant, I will! for therefore came I hither; And Denmark ne'er shall call that errand thriftless, For which her prince disguis'd him like a peasant. Sew. Yet hear me, Curan, or a speedy ruin— Cur. What ruin? Sewold, I will own myself The heir of Denmark, can he then refuse An instant audience? Sew. Ah, rash Prince, bethink thee Wherefore thou art disguis'd; is't not to hide The heir of Denmark? rightly didst thou doubt, That, fair as fame blazons this virgin's charms, The blazon might be false; therefore this masking, That thou unnotic'd might'st behold the Princess, And pass thy own true judgment on her charms. The veil thrown off, thou throw'st away its use; And must, perforce, ev'n if she prove most homely, Proceed to nuptial union; as a Prince Thou canst not then recede. Cur. Sewold, I can; He sets me the example. Sew. Hapless youth! Have I then all in vain pour'd on thine ear The love of honour, that, with virtuous thirst, Still drank it gladly? Has my moral pencil So oft portray'd the forms of truth and falshood, In their just lineaments, to thy mind's eye; And hast thou lov'd the one, and scorn'd the other, Unbid, save by the voice that bade within? Thou know'st thou hast; say then, shall one example, Base as it is, and as thou feel'st it is, Undo?— Cur. Ah, spare me, Sewold, spare the rest, And let the blush, that tingles on my cheek, Implore thy pardon. I forgot myself; Forgot that thou, my master, and my friend, Heard the rash word—I am myself again. Yet, Sewold, ere we go, means must be found To see the Princess. Sew. After such affront Cast on the absent Majesty of Denmark— Cur. Nay, Sewold, now thy reason, in its turn, Meets the mad shock of passion; Edel's fault Leaves his niece blameless. Sew. True; and could it be That, ere we left th' inhospitable shore, A fit occasion offer'd, I should wish Thine eye might make of her its wish'd decision: That so each nation might, from speedy broils, Perhaps, be freed; for, prove she common fair, As is the general lot of half her sex, I trust thou wouldst not pay, for such a Queen, A single subject's life. Cur. But if she prove That paragon of charms, that bright-ey'd phœnix, Which rumour paints her, I will make this Saxon Produce me other pleas than tender age, To step between her beauty and my love. Sew. What, Prince, if we retire? and near our ships Rest us encamp'd till her dead father's bones Be solemnly inhum'd. Cur. A public audience, I think, King Edel ever will refuse. Sew. And so think I. Cur. I have a plan, my Sewold; Give it thy patient hearing. In this garb No Saxon can suspect my quality. Go thou unto the fleet, while I wait here, And make my way t' her presence as a page. Or rather—yes, that is the likelier plot, I'll change my garb with my young minstrel Rolland; Thou know'st I can so touch our Danish harp, As by my practis'd skill to gain her ear. Is't not a likely plot? Sew. What, leave my Prince With strangers, and, if all like Edel, foes? Cur. Thou dost not leave thy Prince, too wary Sewold, Thou leav'st a minstrel; and what land so savage, Where minstrels cannot practise their lov'd art In honour'd safety? All men hold them sacred; Thy office hardly more so. This besides, Bethink thee of those truths, thyself hast taught me, When, in thy lecture, as was oft thy wont, Thou weigh'dst, in wisdom's balance, what the poize Of princely, and of peasant happiness. In one bright scale lay riches, pomp, and power; In th' other, health, content, and quiet slumbers. On that side, poisons, plots, assassinations; On this, security and careless ease. These last are now my lot. I'm the safe peasant; And mean to prove, by fair experiment, That thy sage saws were true. Nay, my best Sewold, If thou forbid'st me use that good discretion, Thy schooling taught me, I must say thou think'st I am no docile pupil. Sew. Dearest Prince, It is my joy, my pride, that I have taught thee To cope with difficulties greater far Than this may seem: for as experience taught me, How seldom princes know to act like men, I've shewn thee what man is: and therefore led thee Thro' many an unfrequented path of life, That greatness scantly wots of: bade thee mark That plain unsightly plant, call'd Human Nature, When sprouting forth spontaneous; how far culture Improves its form; and what the force of art To call forth its best bloom. How too that art, Like a too rank and too nutricious soil, Oft marrs its purpose, turning to vain leaf What else had borne a plenteous crop of virtues. These truths to learn, the best the world can teach, We've pac'd thro' cities, villages, and forests, Sometimes a pilgrim I, with cockled hat, And thou the stripling bearer of my wallet. Cur. And, in such masking, own to me, my Sewold, Did I e'er fail to play the part thou bad'st me? Sew. In sooth thou didst not. Cur. Therefore, holy pilgrim, Suppose me now gone a short stone's cast from thee, To crave an alms at some fat yeoman's porch. “A mite for charity! give you good den, “A mite for sweet St. Bridget! My old father, “A pilgrim worn with penances to shrines, “Half spent with journeying, lies in yonder dell. “God's Mother shield you! give an oaten crust “To break our craving fasts,” why this is all The danger, if you leave me in this castle. Sew. Delicate Prince, I own there is not much; Train'd as thou art, there is not much, I think, I here may leave thee safely. But not long— Cur. But for two little days, perhaps but one. Sew. And where shall I await thee? Cur. My best Sewold, Thou know'st, when we did quit our anchor'd barks, We crost a pleasant valley; rather say A nest of sister vales, o'erhung with hills Of varied form and foliage; every vale Had its own proper brook, the which it hugg'd In its green breast, as if it fear'd to lose The treasur'd chrystal. You might mark the course Of these cool rills more by the ear, than eye; For, tho' they oft would to the sun unfold Their silver as they past, 'twas quickly lost; But ever did they murmur. On the verge Of one of these clear streams there stood a cell O'ergrown with moss, and ivy; near to which, On a fall'n trunk, that bridg'd the little brook, A hermit sat. Of him we ask'd the name Of that sweet valley, and he call'd it Hakeness. Thither, my Sewold, go, or pitch thy tent Near to thy ships, for they are near the scene. Nay, to the fleet I'll bear thee company, And pass the coming night; so will the Saxons Think we have left their land, then, on the morrow, With harp in hand, and wallet at my side, I'll back to Whitby. Sewold, fear me not, Surest success must crown our ripen'd plot. [Exeunt. END OF THE FIRST ACT. ACT II. SCENE I. The Gate of the Castle. Enter the Falconer and Ralph bearing two Falcons hooded for the field. FALCONER. Now a murrain on thee, Ralph! did I not bid thee to fist the blank falcon with the bare breast? He, that on our last day's sport, flew so lusty a flight after the two herons. Ral. The bird was full-gorg'd, master; and marvel it is, that there was one, unfed up, in the mew; for who would have thought that the king would have been minded to hawk to day? Fal. Who would have thought! there it is now; as if it became thee, Ralph, to think? No, Ralph, no; thinking, let me tell thee, hardly becomes thy betters. I, now, for example, whose style and title on the Chamberlain's roll stand thus, “His Majesty's first Yeoman Falconer,” whereas thou writest thyself, or rather they write for thee, sub, that is to say subaltern, which means no more than a mere underling. Now mark me, I, as being thy principal, should be principally entitled to think; was thinking, as I before noted, any part of our office. Ral. Nevertheless thoughts be free, master; and will come into our brain whether they be in office or not.— Therefore I cannot help thinking that if one royal brother had been coffin'd before the other, that is to say instead of the other, that brother would not have taken his pastime thus timelessly. Fal. Drinking, thou know'st, Ralph, drives care away, and why may not hawking serve the same good purpose? However this be, his Majesty being minded to hawk, we, look you, must be minded to have our matters in readiness. Therefore cope me that tarsel's talons, and fasten the lease to his jesses more tightly. Mercy on me, what bells be these? Silver, sterling silver tho' they be, they look no better than base pewter; cleanse me them with the lappit of thy leathern doublet, and that instantly. Ha! what younker have we here thus fantastically accoutered? Ral. Belike it be some scape-goat from the Danish flock, for I saw two or three in the like trim, when the ambassador took his departure. Enter CURAN. [Drest as a minstrel.] Cur. Give you good day, my masters; 'tis my wish To rest awhile on this same portal bench, If so no churlish porter would be angry. Fal. A smooth-tongued stripling, and withal honestly featur'd; sit where it listeth thee, for thou seemest, my pretty boy, to have outrun thy strength. Cur. Say rather I've outrun my breath, good falconer; Give me a moment's pause, and these young legs, I think, would bear me up a morning's sport Close at your coursers' heel, nor should your hawks, What time they darted at their feathered prey, So fleetly pounce, but I would catch their game Warm as it fell, or e'er it touch'd the ground. Fal. Why, when I was of thy age, stripling, and as lithe in the joints, I have often verified thy boast, let me tell thee. Cur. Doth the king hawk to day? Fal. He is so minded, my fair youth, we are here waiting his forth-coming. Cur. Say then, if, to beguile the ling'ring time, I touch my harp, and chaunt to it a song, Would it be welcome to thy ear, good falconer? Fal. Troth would it, my sweet lad; provided the burthen of thy song be not too tedious, and that the measure mar not the sense, as is too often the case with the new-fangled measures now a days. Cur. Fear it not, falconer, it shall be a song Of which a Northern prince, some ages gone, Fram'd both the rhymes and music; thou wilt find From its sad burthen that he woo'd a princess Of cruel sort, who mock'd his loving suit. Fal. There be others besides princesses, youth, who be such like mockers. I have heretofore met one myself in no nobler a shape than that of a miller's daughter. Tho' I was ev'n then in the king's patent service, and as tall of my inches as thou seest me at present. I will therefore have a fellow feeling for thy prince, having experienced Dorcas's cruelty. Ale, however, helpt me to master my passion, and I prescribe the same remedy to thee, if thou ever should'st come to years of discretion, and should'st chance to be in the same plight: for there be ten excellent qualities in your sound-bodied ale, the first— Ral. Nay, master, if thou tellest him what these qualities be, in the same sermon-like way thou hast often divided them in my hearing, the king will be here ere we have the lad's ditty; and my ears tingle for it. Fal. Come on then, my dainty minstrel; we will have thy song first. CURAN Sings. [See the song entituled that of Harold the Valiant, in page 196 of Vol. I. and of which he is supposed to perform to his Harp one or more stanzas, till interrupted by the entrance of King Edel with Lords attending him to the field. He speaks to one of them entering.] EDEL. Go to, go to, We will not waste one thought upon the Dane. He goes displeased. Why, be it so; our state Sits not so loosely on its well-laid base, That Denmark, let him put his best strength to it, Can shake its firmness. Said'st thou not their fleet Were sail'd? whence then is this young minstrel? He wears the Danish livery. Lord. Sir, I know not. [Curan throws himself at the king's feet. Cur. My gracious Liege, for I will call thee mine, For, if not mine, where may I find another? Friendless, forlorn, left on a foreign coast, By those whose ruthless hearts forbid my tongue To call them countrymen. O sacred Sir, Take pity on my wretched state; command Some of your train to find me an employ, The lowest not too low for present trial, Till after proof of duty find me friends May plead, in my behalf, to your dread ear. Meanwhile I would not rust in idleness, That bane of youth, and what too soon might dull The small, yet practised, faculties I boast. Ed. Thou talk'st it smoothly, stripling, yet we fear Thou art some elfish truant, who has dar'd Thy vassalage throw off, or else, perchance, For some committed fraud, has fled the stripes Due to dishonesty. Cur. Think not thus harshly, Great Monarch, of your slave. Know, I was born Of honest parents, virtuously brought up In fear of God, and man. My aged father Doth now in Denmark's court, and in the presence, Strike the chief harp, first of the minstrel band. Me to Lord Sewold's train did he promote, For that his Excellence did much applaud My growing skill, and gave him cause to hope Fair Argentile, Prince Curan's destin'd spouse, Would, if she heard me touch the harp before her, Make me her minstrel. In this hope I left My lov'd and loving father. On the sea, Full sorely was I sick, sick ev'n to death; And, for remembrance of those piercing pangs I own I loiter'd ('twas my only crime) The hindmost, when Lord Sewold parted hence. Which known, the Earl, with many a rigid menace, Bade me “seek here those honours from the Saxons, That he had fail'd to find.” These were his words; Withal forbidding the remorseful shipmates To let me mount the vessel. Cruel Dane! I saw thee hoist thy sails, and call'd for pity; I saw thy shallop fleetly cut the waves, And call'd for pity, till my aching eye Lost sight of the last barque: then on the strand, Fell I as dead; till youth and nature struggling Brought back unwelcome life. O gracious King! Take pity on that helpless minstrel boy, Who found none from his countrymen. Ed. In sooth, My Lords, this Danish boy doth tell his tale With such a bold and plain simplicity, As much persuadeth us he speaks us true. Hast thou, my boy, good skill in minstrelsy? Cur. So, Sire, to say would be too bold a vaunt; For higher of that noble art I deem And its try'd mystery, than yet to boast I had arriv'd at ev'n the midmost pitch Of music's high perfection. Fal. Please you, my Liege, the lad is too modest. If his fingers went by clock-work they could not wrestle with the wires more actively, nor, if a skylark roosted in his throat, could he carol to them more deliciously: he's the very prince of minstrels. Ed. Peace, knave, and mind thy hawks, and not his harp. Cur. If it seem good unto my gracious Lord, I'll run to th' field at his proud courser's side, And there some moments, ere the game be sprung, Or at default, make essay of my art On this slight instrument, striving my best To sooth his princely ear. Ed. Come on then, boy, We there will try thy skill. My Lords, to horse, And meet us at the bridge, that spans the mote. Ourselves at the west postern mean to mount. [Exeunt severally, Curan following the king. SCENE II. A Garden within the walls of the Castle. Enter ARGENTILE and EDITHA, with Baskets. EDITHA. Nay, sweetest mistress, share with me the pains, If it be pains, amid these beds of fragrance To cull such buds and blooms, as best deserve To fill our wicker garners. Therefore came we; 'Twas of your own free choice: you said the task Would help to chase your sorrows. See, my Princess, How deep a blush, beyond its red compeers, This rose has caught from the warm kiss of Phœbus! That, tho' its neighbour, and as far remov'd From shade and cold, yet glows not half so crimson. Is it the fault o' th' sun? No; he, kind suitor, Makes love to both alike. Perchance, my mistress, That flower, like some coy maids, makes more ado Ere it will warm to kindness. Arg. Peace, fond babbler! Ed. Nay, now I vow, had I so bright a suitor, That blest me with such gallant visitation, I'd not do thus, nor turn my pale cheek from him, But bid him welcome with a buxom blush, Like this free flower, and thank him for his favours. Were it not best, what think you? Arg. Prithee, peace, I know thou mean'st to chear me by this prattle? But 'twill not be—come, let us count our thefts: We've done, methinks, ev'n robbery enough On these sweet beds. Ed. See here! besides these roses Are lilies nam'd o'th' vale, which, to my sense, Fling from their silver bells a daintier perfume, Than ev'n the rose itself; spic'd fraxinel, The golden martagon, the pale narcissus, And flaunting piony; here's lady's slipper, And lady's mantle too; curl'd columbines, And harebells blue and white! Arg. No, not a month; [Not regarding her. But come another day 'twill be a month, Since my dear father lean'd him on this arm, And took some slow-drawn paces down this alley; But he was tir'd full soon, and sat him down To rest on this same bench; he panted so, That then I fear'd him dying. Ed. Nay, sweet Princess, Did you not promise me? Arg. Indeed I did; Yet then, in very deed, I little hop'd I long should keep my word. Ed. Think of his years— Arg. I know he was full aged, yet some have counted More years than he; and some have liv'd to see, What most they wish'd, their daughters given in marriage, And blest the sacred union. Ed. Some, alas! Have left them sooner, in weak infancy; Have left them fatherless, nay, in their cradles; Hurried by death ev'n to their wife's fresh grave, Who died in child-bed: such was my sad case; And tho' of gentle, nay, of noble birth, If nobleness can dwell where riches do not, Friendless, forlorn, ah! what had I been now, Had not the Queen your mother's fost'ring care Pity'd my orphan state? Arg. I fear, my friend, I am to blame, ev'n unto sin to blame, Arraigning thus the will of Providence. Yet he, who gave me tears, will let me shed them, I trust, without a frown. His gift were vain, Did I not weep. Ed. Your royal uncle's care— Arg. Is he like Adelbright? will he support Sad Argentile with half his tenderness? Thou canst not think it. Thou thyself hast felt His sterner temper; for when Oswald's son, The gallant Edwin sued for thee in marriage, Who but my uncle mar'd your mutual bliss, And made his father act a tyrant's part? Alas, thou weep'st! I was to blame in op'ning A wound, that time had clos'd. Ed. And if I weep, 'Tis only that his hapless love for me Caus'd the brave youth to fly his native realm, A voluntary exile. To his suit Thou know'st, my Princess, I demean'd myself Ever with virgin coyness, as I ought. Arg. Thou didst, and therein claim'st thy sexes praise. Ed. Gallant as Edwin was, my tongue was able To interdict his passion; therefore, sure, I lov'd him not, spite of the rising sighs That ever meet his mention. Had I lov'd him, I must have yielded; he was all so worthy To raise a mutual flame—where then my praise? But, hush, his father comes! his earnest look Tells me he means to claim a private audience. He ill would brook my presence. Arg. Thou, poor Editha, Wilt ev'n as ill brook his! retire thee, then; Yet stray not out of call. [Exit Editha. Enter OSWALD. Osw. Your pardon, Princess, That, quitting forms, I thus abruptly venture— Arg. Ah, my good Lord, away with idle forms! You were my Father's friend, and that secures A constant welcome to his orphan child. But why so much disturb'd? Osw. Is there not cause? Has not King Edel done— Arg. What, my good Lord? Till this same hour I never left my chamber. What has my uncle done? Osw. Flouted the Dane, And sent his Envoy back with blank refusal. Arg. 'Tis as I thought, not fear'd: yet herein read A sum of num'rous future wrongs prepar'd To fall full soon upon my innocent head. Osw. Not one, not one, no not the slightest wrong, While Oswald wields a sword to check its fall. Have comfort, Princess; you have round your person A set of Peers, whose perfect loyalty Will at my call pour out their best heart's blood In your defence. Arg. O Heav'n forefend, my Lord, That Argentile should be the cause of bloodshed! Sooner than so, I would resign my throne, And take a subject's station. Trust me, Earl, I ne'er was fond of this same pageant state, And smilingly could quit it. Osw. Say not so. Born to a crown, that crown must grace your head: And we have powers to give it legal firmness. Arg. No, rather let him drive me from his realm A hapless exile. I am not the first His arts have forc'd away. Osw. I read your meaning. It was indeed his arts, curst Edel's arts, That struck the flint on my too fervent nature, And bade it fire. Stop, ye repentant sighs, You will not call my darling Edwin back! Alas! you cannot: to th' extremest verge Of this wide isle my fruitless search has reach'd: No, I must ne'er again behold my boy; He's lost, I fear, for ever. Arg. Hope the best; And promise me, if e'er the youth returns, He'll have thy full forgiveness. Osw. So from Heav'n May I have precious hope of after pardon, As now my son has mine! Arg. Enough, enough. Thou shew'st thyself again a tender father; Therefore I take thee for my loyal friend, Nay rather for my father. Yes, good Earl, Thou know'st I want one; thou too want'st a child: Act then a father's part, and guard my weakness 'Gainst my fear'd uncle's arts. Yet, if he goes No further than to break my present marriage, He has my ready pardon: She, who loses A boon she never yet had learn'd to prize, Is scarce a loser. Does he wish me still To live in virgin state? My wishes there Bear him free company; yet much I fear Some greater cruelty. Osw. To thwart these nuptials Is more than cruelty; 'tis sacrilege To Adelbright's just memory— Arg. Of this, My Lord, your prudence must more fitly judge Than a young maiden's. Therefore, Sir, to you, And to such peers as were my father's friends, I trust my honest cause, and will in all Accord to your sage councils. Honour'd Earl, Adieu. Come forward, faithful Editha, And lead me to my chamber. [Exeunt Argentile and Editha. Osw. Remorseless tyrant! To wrong this pattern of all virgin virtues; While I have life I will oppose thy malice! [Exit Oswald. SCENE III. Changes to the Gate of the Castle. Enter King Edel and Lords as returned from Hawking. Curan, Falconer, and Ralph attending. EDEL. Beshrew me, Lords, but this same Danish boy Did give us sweet addition to our sport. I know not whether most to praise the fleet Activity, by which, our game in view, He cours'd the field, and left our fleetest steeds Lagging behind; or whether, at default, Perch'd on some land-mark stone, he struck his harp And caroll'd his soft ditty. By St. Hilda He is a peerless boy. Ld. True, my dread Liege: And then his dauntless spirit, mixt so meekly With boyish shamefac'dness! for when your Highness Did praise his skill, it brought a crimson blush Fresh to his cheek, that seem'd to call in question Whether such praise were just, proving by the doubt His rightful claim to it. Ed. True, we noted it; A merit seldom mark'd in such as ply The minstrel craft. Come forward, pretty youth, Take thou these angels. Thou hast pleas'd us well. My Lord our Chamberlain, have it in charge This boy be well appointed, in such sort As fits our cup-bearer. Thus we advance him Ev'n at the first, and his shall be the blame If he not gains swift marks of future favour. Cur. Low at your feet I fall, my gracious Sov'reign, And promise true allegiance. Ed. Rise, and thank us By thy fair service. We do hold to-morrow A high carousal. See that thou attend us In thy fit weeds, when in our hall we dine, We and our peers. [Exeunt Edel and Lords. Manent CURAN, FALCONER, and RALPH. Cur. Why, this is as it should be— Our good star smiles on us beyond our hopes. How now, good Master Falconer, why this distance? What! cap in hand too; prithee, friend, be cover'd. Fal. I know better, good Master Cup-bearer, I know better. When, indeed, the every day sun in yonder sky shines upon me, I veil myself without ceremony, expecting no more from him than a scorch'd forehead; but, when the sun of court favour shines upon me, though as now, only as it were by reflexion, I doff my cap most reverently, as thereby hoping for somewhat that may warm my old heart. As for you, my young Sir, who are become to-day the minion of dame Fortune, I know not how thou wilt demean thyself to-morrow; therefore before to-morrow comes, I will venture to call myself thy old friend; inasmuch I was thy friend before the King was, and am withal three years older than his Majesty. Cur. I own thee for my friend, and hold thy kindness In fair memorial. Fal. I thank thee. Yet as the good luck, which has of late befallen thee, may in time help to weaken thy memory, suffer me to put thee now in mind that, in the morning when thou camest hither out of breath, desirous of sitting on yonder bench to rest thee awhile, I call'd thee pretty youth, and bade thee sit down boldly; thereby, as I may say, installing thee for a courtier. Cur. Thou didst, and for that courteous installation This angel be thy fee. [Gives him the money. Fal. Blessings on thy young heart! had I thought thou would'st have paid me thus generously, I would have pull'd off my doublet and made thee a cushion of it; thou should'st never have been installed on the hard stone. But I would wish thee also to recollect, that the very moment thou mad'st offer to give me a touch of thy minstrelsy, I took thee at thy word. Whereby— Ral. Nay, in troth, Master, that thou didst not, but was minded to interrupt the lad's ditty (I crave your honour's pardon, for you was but a lad then), yet your honour well knows he would have told you a long preamble about the ten virtues in strong ale, which I, who have heard the old homily a hundred times, and know it to be as long as one of Father Anselm's, and withal as unedifying, save when one has the brown pitcher before one, persuaded him to cease the delivery of. This had I not done in the very nick of time— Cur. Thou didst; and for that friendly office, see, How this twin angel greets thee. [Gives Ralph an angel. Ral. Aye, that indeed does it, and most angelically poor Ralph is your liege vassal for ever. Fal. Though the knave has, as I may say, robb'd me of my second merit, neither he nor any man in Dëira shall of my third; which resteth in this, that I prais'd thy minstrelsy to the King: and what, though he flouted me for it? I have known him many a time and oft do so in the field, and yet nevertheless abide by my council: Therefore assure thyself, that what I said concerning the lark's roosting in thy throat did thee no thriftless piece of service. Cur. Whether it did or not, 'twas said in kindness, And is as such rewarded. [Gives him another angel. Fal. St. Hilda bless thee! There remaineth now but a fourth merit to remind thee of, which, to say truth, respecteth myself singly. It is this; that I, being, as thou seest, an old and true-bred courtier, am wholly void of one vice, which hath been imputed to our sect for time immemorial. Cur. I pray thee name it. Fal. That can I, Master, and with a safe conscience. —The vice is envy, which, thou knowest, is one of the seven deadly sins. Now whereas thou art suddenly made King's cup-bearer, and thereby put over the head of myself and many a better man, yet do I not envy thee thine honour; but think verily thou wilt acquit thyself in that high office better, than ev'n I should myself at these years. Cur. Indeed, and may I credit thee! Ral. Nay, Master, here put I in for a share in the merit. I am younger, and, I trust, more handy than the Falconer himself, and yet, where the matter of cup-bearing is concerned, I knock under to your honour's courtly bearing and gentility. I do in faith. Cur. Enough; then share this last bright coin between ye, And see you drink to my prosperity. Good friends, farewell. [Exit Curan. Ral. Aye, my Master, that will we do: we'll see the cann to the bottom, were it as big as Ulphus's horn. Fal. Ralph, mark me well, Ralph, this young spendthrift will be wiser in time. But till that time comes, it behoves us to drink to the long continuance of so generous a folly. [Exeunt Ralph and Falconer. SCENE IV. The King's Closet.—EDEL, solus. Ev'n when we first set eye upon this youth We thought his face trick'd out by our good stars To fit our long-meant purpose. He shall wed Our niece; shall pass on her for Denmark's prince. His youth, his comeliness, his country too, Will stamp him very Curan in her heart; And, married to an alien and a peasant, Where then will be her royalty? But first I must dismiss Earl Oswald. He is honest, And has, what oft is found with honesty, A hot and credulous spirit, which we found Easy to practise on to his son's ruin, Who had that stubborn and rebellious bearing, We fear'd might after harm us. But in this, Were we to make the old earl privy to it, He ne'er would meet our wishes: he shall go Envoy to Denmark; but my arts will fail me, If e'er he living lands on Denmark's shore. What ho! who waits there? is Lord Oswald come? Enter OSWALD with an USHER. Ush. My Liege, the Earl attends. [Exit Usher. Ed. Welcome, good Oswald! We have a weighty business to impose On thy allegiance, and, as we do hold Thy prudence far beyond the vulgar scope, Resolve in this high point to trust it solely. Osw. My Liege, ye do out-rate it. Ed. Not a whit. Believe us, honest Oswald, we have pois'd Thy merits well, and found them in our balance Of sterling proof—but to the present business. Thou know'st already we of late thought fit To check this alien marriage of our neice, And thwart the hasty Dane. Osw. I do indeed, And marvel at it much; nay, to speak plain, (Oswald must speak so, tho' his King's the hearer) It wounds your brother's memory. Ed. Hear our reasons. We hold it all unsafe, for the realm's weal, A stranger should come in to lord it here In right of our young niece; and therefore, Earl, (Tho' inly did our bowels yearn to break Our word with our dead brother) yet the good Of two great kingdoms far o'ercame that scruple. Osw. But when the offended majesty of Denmark Shall arm a fleet— Ed. Why, this may be expected; And though we trust we have sufficient powers To cope with his best strength, yet would we rather Prevent all bloodshed; and with this fair aim We mean to send thee, in all haste, to Denmark, Our peaceful envoy. Osw. Might I bear the Princess To her expecting spouse, I should with joy Accept the high commission: such a freight Will only load my ship with the just price To buy us peace from Denmark. Ed. Tush, old Earl, The Dane will dread to fight us: let him dare it. After such truce thy audience there may win, We shall be well-prepar'd to meet his wrath, And foil it too. Osw. You said you wish'd for peace. Ed. I do; if peace and amity, Lord Oswald, May be procur'd at a much cheaper rate, Than one of our two kingdoms. Osw. Our two kingdoms! Then, Argentile, thy half is lost already. [Aside. Ed. Why muse ye thus, my Lord, we did expect More free acceptance of that honour'd charge, Which we so freely offer'd. Osw. Age, my Liege, Makes me unfit— Ed. Say rather that thy age Makes thee most fit; for reverence hangs on age, And suits our envoy. Lords of greener years Would sue for the great charge, but on thyself Our choice has fixt; if thou disclaim'st the task, Thou art not what I deem'd thee. For the moment I leave thee to resolve what likes thee best, Whether to meet thy Sov'reign's will with duty, Or force him think, what he would wish unthought, Thou'rt the Dane's friend not his: within an hour Give me thy final and assenting answer. [Exit Edel. Osw. It is too plain; he does but wish my absence, To pass some cruel fraud on Argentile; And give himself, by that fair maid's mishap, More right, or seeming right, in his two kingdoms. Two kingdoms, tyrant!—One is more than due, But patience—I must act awhile the part My soul disdains, must seem to accept his charge— Yes, I will be his envoy to the Dane; But only to convey that treasure with me Is the Dane's plighted due. Now to the Princess, To win her to my purpose: she must hence, And quickly; for, if here she dares to wait, Death, or still worse than death, must be her fate. [Exit Oswald. END OF THE SECOND ACT. ACT III. SCENE I. A Royal Apartment. Enter King EDEL and CURAN. Ed. Dost thou not boast? Cur. In truth I do not, Sir; Ev'n in our days of greenest infancy I was his humble play-mate; and, when youth Nerv'd him for stouter sports, the gallant Prince Would make me his compeer; to shoot the shaft, To pitch the bar, to wrestle, race, or tilt, In these and all like proofs of hardiment, He ever chose my rivalry. Ed. If so, Haply, thou now couldst counterfeit his person. Cur. I could, my Liege, were there a fit occasion. Ed. Were we right sure of this, occasion now Should call thee to the trial. Cur. Some have thought My lineaments did much resemble Curan's. Nay, once I do remember, in our childhood, We did in sport change dress; and I the while, My little heart beating with innocent pride, So strutted in his plumes, as caus'd a smile On many a cheek to see with what mock grace I aped the heir of Denmark. Ed. So even now Thou seem'st to act him o'er again; in sooth Thou art a peerless boy, and wilt befit Our business to our wish; which, to tell briefly, Is this, that thou, in semblance of the prince, Should'st play the suitor to our royal niece; For which thy youth, and, wherefore should we rob thee Of what was Heav'n's own gift, thy comliness Will stand thee in good stead. Beauty and youth Are the best weapons in a gallant's hand To conquer virgin coyness, these thou hast From nature, these king Edel bids thee use, Which, if thou dost like one of Cupid's teaching, Beshrew me, boy, but it will raise thy fortunes Higher than now thou dream'st of. Cur. My dread Liege, Ye surely mean to mock your humble vassal; I pray ye scoff not at my poverty. Ed. Trust us, fair youth, we do not. By our faith, A sov'reign's faith, win thou our Argentile And thou shalt wear her. But she must be won, Her heart, her soul must be thine own so fixt, That if we frown and cross awhile your nuptials, Which for state reasons we perchance may feign, Thou may'st persuade her to be thine by flight: This if thou canst atchieve— Cur. I know not, Sir, But this so sudden, so unhoped an honour O'erpowers me wholly; can you mean, my Liege, In very truth? Ed. By all the saints we do. Cur. Then be it so; that gracious smile did seem To dart a ruddy beam of royalty Warm to my heart. I am not what I was; I tread with loftier step; my heart beats high, As if the blood of Denmark boil'd within it. Ed. Excellent boy! his ev'ry word and gesture Insures success, and tops our highest hope. In faith, Prince Curan, for thou well dost suit The gallant title, thou dost please us highly. Some three hours hence take heed that thou attend Our summons to our closet: thou shalt there Have further schooling; meanwhile, on thy life, Be secret. Cur. Take that life, if I am false. Ed. We will not doubt thee; favour'd as thou art, Thou must be true to us, who show such favour, And mean so to augment it. Cur. At thy feet I swear— Ed. Arise, thou hast our confidence, And soon shalt from our wardrobe have dispens'd Those vestments, which befit thy state to wear In audience of our niece. Cur. Impatiently, My Liege, shall I expect them; for these weeds Seem now to sit untowardly upon me: I burn to change them. Ed. Wait us in our closet. [Exit King. Cur. (solus) Can it be thus? indeed, indeed men wrong thee, My mistress Fortune, when they paint thee blind! Shew me an eagle, that, with firmest eye Can meet the sun in his meridian march, And I will call that eye, compar'd with thine, The bat's that blinks at twilight: were 't not so, Thou could'st not guide thy hardly-govern'd wheel So evenly foreright, as now thou dost; And swift too, as 't would fire its very axle. O that my Sewold knew!—But truce awhile With exultation. Pass three little hours And I have audience of fair Argentile. How then to act? why, as a spirit would, Who has the magic power to shift, and turn From visible t' invisible, as best May suit his present purpose. Let me see her, And in her face, I con the ready part I have to play; the full game thus before me, I'll win it, or I'll lose it, as I list. Enter FALCONER. Fal. Where is the King's Majesty? lead me instantly to the King's Majesty's own personal presence! Mercy on me, I have hardly breath left me to deliver that news to him which, I trust, will choak him with choler. Brave master Cup-bearer, present me unto him this moment. —There is no time to be lost, I can assure you; by this they must be at least six miles deep, look you, in the forest. Cur. They! say, who mean you? Fal. Yes, in good troth, that is a likely story; and from a man of my years and experience, who has been about court, man and boy, for full fifty years come next all-hallow tide; to expect now by one single, and, with your leave, simple question, to get such a secret out of such a man! But you are a green courtier, master Cup-bearer, and are therefore to be excused. Come, lead me to the King's Majesty; it will suffice, I trust, if I unbosom unto his Grace those I mean by my they, that are now in the forest. Cur. Thou art indeed an old and full-bred courtier Thus to forget— Fal. What! that you gave me certain angels of late to drink to your God-speed? The service for which those angels were given was conscientiously performed. Why then should the memory of the gift remain, when the cause of it is cancell'd. Nevertheless I do remember those angels so well, and the number of them, as to know that, were they increas'd in tenfold proportion, they would not purchase an answer to thy present question, though compriz'd in a tiney single syllable. Enough for thee to know, that the secret is for royal ears, to which I command thee to lead me. Cur. I will lead no man to the royal presence, Who brings unpleasant tidings. Fal. Thou art a shrewd stripling, that must be said for thee, having already guest so much of my secret, as to know it is no very pleasant one. Cur. Who then, but thee, would bear it to the King? Was it a secret he would joy to hear, Thy fee might chance be ample; as it is, Trust me, he'll only pay thee with a frown, Fitting the sort and colour of that secret. Fal. Why indeed I do believe it will make his Majesty swear a little. Cur. Surely it will—to go without his leave By stealth, and thro' the forest. Then their rank, Men he so much had honour'd.— Fal. Nay, there you are out; there is but one man in the party. Cur. The princess surely has not fled the court. Fal. Since thou dealest with the devil, I find it will be most prudent in me to make thee a party concern'd. —Know then most assuredly, that the princess has fled the court, accompanied only with old Lord Oswald. Cur. Death to my hopes—but art thou sure of this? Fal. If seeing is believing, that am I; but to tell thee the matter in form and circumstance. I was practising a tarsel at the lure, in a deep sort of a dell, some two miles distant from the castle; where I heard a rustling of leaves in a sidelong road to the left; there, thro' the thicket, I saw the princess brush briskly on that white palfry, on which she has hawked these two last seasons; before her gallop'd Lord Oswald on his stout bay gelding, who is half brother to King Edel's Swift; that very same steed he rode on yesterday, when thou sang'st thyself into thy preferment. They made as much haste, I can assure thee, as a vile, stony, uphill, bridle-style road would suffer them. But this is not all; for, hast'ning home with my news, I met with another strong cause of suspicion that they are bent on no honest errand; for, crossing the road that leads to the west gate, I saw a smock-fac'd kind of youth, more smock-fac'd even than thyself, bless the mark, in a green doublet and hose, trudging away as fast as a pair of very spindle-shanked legs could carry him; 'twas a face I had seen before, but could not rightly tell where; nor did I recollect it till I had enter'd the castle-gate. But now I'll take my Bible oath 'twas no boy but a girl, and that girl my Lady Editha, the princess's fav'rite waiting-gentlewoman. Cur. Did she pursue her mistress? Fal. No, no, she took quite a different road, yet a footpath, that meets the other some eight miles distance: she went down the valley, whereas the princess and Lord Oswald took up the hill. Cur. And would'st thou bear such tidings to the King? Fal. Marry that would I, and must too, for they be true ones. Cur. Go then and meet his wrath, who didst neglect To seize the handmaid. Go and meet his wrath For this thy tardiness. Know'st not that the time Thou here hast spent with me, is worse than lost: This when he knows, he'll on thy back inflict A stripe for every moment. Fal. Mercy on me! why would'st thou detain me? lead me to him directly. Cur. Falconer, I am thy friend. I'll point a way Much safer than to Edel. Hence with me This instant in pursuit of the lost princess. Fal. What! before we acquaint the King's Majesty of her elopement, and have his royal writ to arrest her highness? Cur. I grant thee, wert thou sure of such commission, It might be well to seek it: but her flight Once known, he will dismiss some earl or knight, Or valorous captain, on such high pursuit, Not thee, poor peasant; what then shall become Of thy reward? now thou and I together Are a full match for Oswald. Him subdued, And Argentile recover'd, double knighthood Will surely be our fee. Fal. Earl Oswald, let me tell you, tho' old, is stout and well timber'd, and may not be so easily master'd as your vanity may imagine. Cur. But we will raise the country to assist us, When once we find them. Fal. Yes indeed, that bears some likelihood. The posse comitatus, and we at the head of them! he cannot make them all knights, and as we shall appear to be the first movers in the business, you know; and the King's patent servants before that— Cur. True, true, but time is precious. Haste we hence. Lead me the way they went, and trust me, Falconer, Soon as we find them, our reward is sure. SCENE II. An outer Court in the Castle. Enter two LORDS. F. Lord. In these Earl Oswald's letters, briefly penn'd The hour they took their flight, you read the sum Of this black business; nor have now to ask For proof more formal or of the King's baseness, Or the Earl's honesty; ere this, I trust, He has lodg'd the princess in some place of safety. S. Lord. I praise his prudence: ev'n in that loud note I'd thunder out destruction to the tyrant, Could words destroy him; but that calls for deeds. F. Lord. And deeds shall be attempted. Mark me, Sir, Already I've bestirr'd me to this end With hope of fair success; prompted by me, Your cousin Aldred, captain of the guards, Ev'n now is sowing thro' the soldiery The seeds of hot commotion. You, my Lord, Can boast much interest with our honest burghers, Which might be us'd. S. Lord. And shall to th' full extent Of my best faculties, for which in pledge I lock this hand of fellowship in thine, And swear to risk my fortune, honour, life, In Argentile's just cause. Nor doubt I, Lord, Before to-morrow's dawn, to head in arms Three thousand citizens. But see the tyrant! Let's hide our honest hate in loyal seemings, Till execution ripens. Enter King EDEL hastily, A Courtier and Ralph following. EDEL. Brings the slave No plainer tidings? Court. None, my gracious Liege. Ed. Fellow, be brief, and tell us all thou saw'st. Ral. Please your Majesty, your Majesty's yeoman falconer and I, who by your Majesty's favour am his deputy, were some hours agone practising a young hawk at the lure in a place on the side of the forest called Deadman's Dell; where we saw the Princess and Earl Oswald ride hastily thro' the thick coppice on the left, just as the gentleman has inform'd your Highness. My master, on seeing them, left me with the bird, and said he would hie him to the castle, and give your Majesty information thereof. Ed. And why in this did the vile traitor fail? Ral. Of that, please your Highness, I am innocent. All I know is, that when I had given my bird its exercise, and was returning to our lodge in the great park, I spied my master at some distance, and the young stripling with him, now your Majesty's cup-bearer. Ed. Ha! said'st thou he, the Danish minstrel! Ral. The same; but in an English forester's garb. Whereupon I was at first minded to go and ask master whether he had waited on your Highness. But when I considered that he was in company with a gentleman of such high office, it behoved me, as I thought, to keep my distance, being assured I should only gain one of my master's heaviest oaths, if not blows, in answer to my question. However, still suspecting that your Majesty might not be privy to the matter, I came forthwith to consult this gentleman, who, under your Majesty's favour, heretofore procured me my place. Ed. Enough, enough; come forward, good my Lords And trusty counsellors. You see your king Struck to the very soul at the strange flight Of our fond niece. Young as the wanton was, We did not think she would so far debase Her royal lineage, as (we blush to own it) This act declares she has. F. Lord. But, gracious Sov'reign, We marvel most Earl Oswald led her forth. Ed. True; but we live in such a world, my Lords, That, whoso marvels at like wickedness, May pass thro' life, feeling no other passion Than blank astonishment. Full well we guess The trait'rous purpose why the Earl contriv'd Our niece's flight; nay, we can count the sums That Denmark long has paid into his coffers. More at our council board will we unfold, Whereat this evening, with our other Lords, We bid ye to attend us. F. Lord. Sire, in all Command our ready duty. Ed. We there mean To take your voices, who may best supply The throne our truant niece has vacated. But first we'll bend us at St. Hilda's shrine, And ask, most needful in a strait like this, Heav'n's holy aid to guide us in our councils. [Exeunt Edel, &amp;c. SCENE III. Changes to the Vale of Hakeness; a Hermit's Cell in front near a Rivulet. Sewold comes out of the Cell, follow'd by Edwin disguis'd as a Hermit, but without his beard. SEWOLD. Thanks to thy courtesy, thou reverend Seer; For youth like thine is reverend. Solitude And silence, inmates of this peaceful vale, Have given thee, what a length of busy years, Spent in the noise and turmoil of the world, Oft fail to give, rich store of useful truths, Well rang'd on memory's tablet. Yet I marvel, Young Lord, what led thee in thy life's fair prime To this so close seclusion; thou hast said, It was not for that end, which ignorance Misdeems religion, and I trust it was not For that still falser end, which rankling spleen Miscalls philosophy. Ed. Indeed it was not. Yet there are ills, begot of sad mischance, Which sacred solitude alone can cure; And some there are, of such a stubborn sort, As mock her powers medicinal; yet still Where'er she fails to cure, she serves to sooth, For this I use her opiate; ever far From perfect remedy, yet much reliev'd By her emollient aid. Sew. There is, young Lord, Another leach, whose drugs have passing power O'er every malady that mars the mind. That leach is Friendship; he would probe thy wound With tenderest hand, and, while he opens, heal. O that my son were here! for I, alas, Am all unequal, from discordant years, To the sweet task! his youthful converse gay, Mixt with soft sympathy and smiling tears, Would lure thee to unbosom in his breast Thy every care, and, opening thus a course To thy pent sorrows, bid them run to waste, Or change them into pleasures. Ed. Think not, Dane, That solitude has blunted in this breast The inborn taste for choice society, Or that still richer relish for blest friendship, Which Nature gives her votaries. Think not, Dane, Quitting the world, I meant to quit that love Instinctive, that each creature owes its kind, And, chief of these, that man still owes to man. Sew. I trust indeed thou didst not.—But methinks I hear some footstep. 'Tis perchance my son— Ah no—my vassal Baldwin from the fleet. Enter a DANISH SAILOR. Sail. My Lord, a fly-boat from yon neighb'ring port, Its freight one seaman only, hail'd our ships; And, when we bade him quietly approach, Row'd sidelong to the first, and on its deck This packet flung, and hied him back with speed. [Sewold takes the letter, opens it, and reads. “To the Lord Ambassador of Denmark, Greeting. “The unkingly manner, in which your high Embassage has been treated, by him who was bound by oath given to the dying King Adelbright to treat it with all due honour, has awaken'd much displeasure in the breast of many honest Saxons, who are at once friends to their own country and well affected to the majesty of Denmark. Amongst these no man is more strongly offended than the writer of this letter, who hereby promises, if so that your Excellency shall think meet to anchor two days longer in your present station, to convey safely to your fleet (if Heav'n favours his just design) the fair object of your embassage. Hoping that ere this shall reach your hands, he shall have already secur'd her from the wiles of the tyrant. “Signed, OSWALD.” Ed. Oswald! [Starting. Sew. That start bespeaks you know him. Ed. Know him! Sew. Methinks I see the tears gush from your eye. Say, Sir, I pray ye, is he of such rank And influence in the court, that I may trust On what he here doth promise? Ed. Noble Dane, He is the very soul of honesty. In virtue as superior as in birth, And from that birth as high an earldom holds As Anglia gives; his virtues are his own. Your pardon, Sir, I cannot count the sum Of his just praises.—Peace, my fluttering heart, He is—but rather let me say, he was— And yet, perchance, now he is Edel's foe, He may be still my father. Sew. Say'st thou, Youth, Thy father? then we need no more credentials. And yet, it seems, from the disjointed phrase That gave this to my knowledge, some harsh treatment, Which sure to such a son—May I not press Thy further confidence? Ed. To such sage ears To tell a tale of disappointed love Must make the teller blush: suffice to say, That for this cause I lodg'd me in this cell; Because, by cruel Edel's arts misled, He frown'd on my chaste wishes; since the day I hid me here twice has yon golden orb Finish'd his annual round, and here did mean To end that life in pining solitude, I was forbid t' enjoy in virtuous love. Yet trust me, Dane, if, as those letters speak, The genius stern of liberty is rous'd, And threats the tyrant's fall, this hermitage No more shall shroud me. Trust me, noble stranger, I'll instant list beneath fair Freedom's banners, Eager to plant my dagger in the breast Of her fell foe. Then farewell these hoar vestments, And welcome helm and hawberk. Sew. Gallant Youth, This zeal sits well upon thy manly front, And soon, I deem, thy father and thy country Will call it into action. For the moment, I hasten to the fleet to spread new orders Touching its further stay. My son, I hope, Will soon be here; for this thy cell was fixt Our place of meeting. If, ere my return, The youth arrives, thy courtesy, I trust, Will bid him kindly welcome. Ed. As a brother. [Exeunt severally. SCENE IV. Changes to another part of the Valley. Enter EDITHA disguised in a Forester's Habit. EDITHA. Thus far, tho' long and dreary was the way, Have I adventur'd safely; and am now Secure from all pursuit. Yet, like the hare That pants, and trembles, and with prick'd-up ears Still thinks the hound is nigh, her speed had foil'd; So do I start, and stop, and fear a foe In every rustling breeze. The housewife, she That with her oaten cakes and curdled cream At yonder homely cabin late refresh'd me, Has made me much her debtor. Heaven so smile On this day's business, as its justice merits; Then to the princess shall my grateful tongue Make fair memorial of that gentle hostess. The FALCONER appears on the Brow of a high Hill to the Left. Fal. What ho! young Dane, what ho! I have done my errand, the fleet lie to the south-east trimly array'd and safely anchored. What ho! do'st not hear me? Ed. Ye Saints defend me! sure I heard a voice. This is no place of safety. [Exit hastily. Fal. What ho! why flyest thou? Have I not done as thou badest me? [Descending the hill.] Murrain take him! if this young scape-gallows has not left me. What ho! Master Cup-bearer! I might as well whistle to the winds as try to recall him. O that a man of my age and sober sense should ever turn out such a fool! first, he makes me climb up a hill, as steep as a very ladder, to look out for the Danish fleet, as if the young knave (who within the year, I trust, has been many a time whipt for climbing his neighbours pear-trees) was not far fitter for such an errand. Up, however, climbs I, at the manifest risk of bursting my old lungs; does the business; spies the fleet; advertises him of it, and what get I for my trouble, but the sight of a pair of light heels, and the comfort of being left alone in a perilous wood? My only consolation is, that, being a stranger to the country, he may peradventure return here for my guidance; therefore in that expectation will I sit down and rest myself a little. Hist, hist, what rustling was that in the glen to the left! Mercy on me! Lord Oswald himself, the very man it was our business to seize. And now in the very nick of time this young traitor has left me. To attack him by myself were very madness, and yet, had I but the courage to do it, I were a made man all my life after. Now, if he were not armed— Enter OSWALD hastily, and seizes the Falconer by the throat. Osw. What errand brought thee here? speak, caitiff, speak. Fal. O for mercy! what? speak when I am throtled! For the love of St. Hilda slacken thy gripe. Osw. Quit then thy staff and all thy other arms, That dagger in thy belt. Lie there, thou ruffian. [Throws him down and lifts his sword over him. Nay, if thou stirr'st this point is in thy heart. Fal. Spare my life, noble Earl, spare but my life, and I'll discover the whole truth. I was decoy'd here, it is true, on the felonious intent of finding where you had bestowed the Princess Argentile. Osw. And dost thou own it, dastard! Fal. Alas! what would lying about the matter do for me? Nay, more, I was spirited up to endeavour to make seizure of your honour's person. Not that I ever meant to attempt it single-handed. The young rogue that was sworn to assist me, has left me here, like a vagabond and coward as he is. And now, having told the whole truth, let me beg on my knees— [Offering to rise. Osw. Nay, if thou stirr'st! Fal. That frown, gracious Sir, is enough for me. O for mercy withdraw that lifted blade! only till I say one short prayer to St. Hilda, that she may intercede with your honour to spare my life. [Oswald takes the belt that hung over the Falconer's shoulder, and with that and the quarter-staff pinions his arms. Osw. Now, traitor, thou art safe; I will not kill thee. Fal. No, noble Oswald, if thou didst, the more would be the pity for me, and the less the profit for thyself; for thereby wouldst thou lose the knowledge of what once told, would be worth the purchase of my pardon, nay, of my freedom. Osw. Go to: Declare that knowledge. Fal. Would you, Sir, be pleased to climb yonder hill with me, I would show your honour a sight would do you good to see; for I am shrewdly out of my politics, if he, that has run away from one king, would not be very fain to put himself under the protection of another. Osw. What mean'st thou, knave? Fal. Nothing, please your worship, but this: That whereas in your present condition, craving your pardon, you are liable to be taken up for a—(I will not name the word, it is so hardly favoured) you might by my honest assistance find safer refuge for yourself, than these old oaks and underling briars will be long able to afford you. Now the Danish fleet being at present within hailing— Osw. Sayst thou the Danish fleet? and not yet sail'd! Fal. I say it, Sir, and swear it to boot; for I saw it just now with these eyes, lying snug at anchor in a bay under the other side of that cliff. Osw. Ha! this is news indeed; my royal charge Is then secure. I'll haste to lead her thither. [Exit hastily. Fal. Nay, for mercy's sake, for the sake of all honour and justice, take off these gyves first, and let me follow! Heugh! a lad of sixteen would not have gone off much more nimbly. He is as quick at the work, as my late honest friend and companion the Cup-bearer. Honesty, there is no such thing now-a-days in the world! Youth and age, sixteen and sixty, makes no difference as to that matter. I am right serv'd for not bargaining better for my liberty, before I told my secret; and nothing, but the manifest fear of death before my eyes, absolves me from the title and stile of mere driveller. All I have now to do is to waddle up and down the forest, like a yoked gander, till some pitiful forester (if there be pity in the kind) sets me at liberty; in the hope of which I now begin my pilgrimage. [Exit Falconer. END OF THE THIRD ACT. ACT IV. SCENE I. Another Part of the Valley. Enter ARGENTILE in the dress of a Shepherdess. ARGENTILE. Welcome, these russet weeds, this pastoral crook, More welcome than the sceptre and the train! These are the simple 'tire that Nature meant Her votaries should wear; sweet smiling Health, And Happiness, and Peace, her holy sisters, Never wore other, when, in better days, They deign'd to dwell with mortals. Hail, thrice hail, Thou solitary scene! how far beyond The pageantry of courts thy stillness charms! This grove my sighs shall consecrate; in shape Of some fair tomb, here will I heap the turf, And call it Adelbright's. Yon aged yew, Whose rifted trunk, rough bark, and knarled roots Give solemn proof of its high antientry, Shall canopy the shrine. There's not a flower, That hangs the dewy head and seems to weep, As pallid blue bells, crow-toes, and marsh lilies, But I'll plant here; and, if they chance to wither, My tears shall water them: there's not a bird That trails a sad soft note, as ringdoves do, Or twitters painfully like the dun martlet, But I will lure, by my best art, to roost And plain them in these branches. Larks and finches Will I fright hence, nor aught shall dare approach This pensive spot, save solitary things That love to mourn, as I do. Enter OSWALD. Osw. Gracious Mistress! I come with news. Arg. Is Editha then found? Osw. I know not that— Arg. Alas! why would'st thou mock me? Osw. The Danes, the Danes are still upon our coast; I learn'd the tidings of a treacherous spy, Whom I disarm'd and bound; and hast'ning back Mounted yon hill, where I myself beheld Their goodly fleet, some fifteen sail or more, Moor'd in a neighb'ring creek. Pitch'd on the beach Stood there a gallant tent, where, I not doubt, The Envoy sojourns. Let me bear you quickly To his protection; for, I fear me much, Discov'ry waits us here. Arg. No, Oswald, no; Till Editha be found I will not leave This secret nook. Didst thou not promise me To hie thee where the parting road might chance Mislead her step? Osw. I did; but this event— O let me instant lead you to the strand! Arg. What, Oswald! and forego the plighted word I gave poor Editha! Here did I fix Our place of meeting; Holy truth forbid I should deceive her! Haste thee hence again. Till her I see, I can resolve on nothing. Take thou the valley, I myself will mount Yon sidelong hill. My eye is younger, Earl, And may descry her sooner. This when try'd, Some two hours hence we'll meet at this same yew. Let's lose no time; nay, answer not, good Oswald, But to the search. To-morrow thou shalt rule, If she be found to day. Heav'n speed thy errand. SCENE II. Another Part of the Valley. Enter CURAN in a Forester's habit. CURAN. How have the mazy tangles of this wood Misled my steps! since he, the faithless Falconer, If faithless, or perchance himself misled, Left me to journey with unguided foot Thro' this wild wilderness. The opening vale Now spreads a broader path; yet, ere I take it, Tir'd as I am, I'll climb this rocky steep, Which towers so high that it insures a sight Of the broad sea. Methinks I'm near it now; For on my breast the gale beats light and keen, And has withal a smack of brine upon it, That seems as freshly stolen from the wave. I hope 'tis so; for much my strength is spent With this long ramble. By your leave, fair bank! Ere I mount further up this rugged hill, I'll press awhile your violets and daisies With my tir'd limbs. What if I sleep awhile? This white thorn brake will screen me, and the brook, That babbles at its foot, persuades to it Most musically; prattle on, cool neighbour! I'll take thy council, and forget my care. [He sleeps. Enter ARGENTILE. Not here! full sure I saw from yonder heights My Editha, in her green huntsman's tire, Bolt from the coppice. It was all too distant To mark her features, yet it sure was she; For they, the boorish inmates of these hamlets, Have none so gentle carriage. I'll not holla, Lest haply I affright her. 'Tis most certain She past by this same dingle. Gracious Powers And here I find her couch'd; her faithful head Wrapt in her scanty mantle! poor spent wench, How fast does sleep infold thee! It were sin To break thy slumbers. I will sit, and watch thee, As oft thy faithfulness, in better days, Has bended o'er my pillow. How her eye Will glisten when she wakes! How will it start, With a glad tear, to see her mistress near her! Yes, the kind maid will weep. I crave thy pardon, Thou'rt now a lusty yeoman, and in truth Thy goat-skin belt, tagg'd with thy bugle horn, And all thy forest geer become thee mainly: Nay, thou might'st pass (thy softer features shrouded Thus as they are) full well for what thou art not. Yet, my best Editha, this rugged stone Seems but a churlish bolster! I will raise Thy head, and—Mercy shield me, ha! [Starts back while Curan wakes. Cur. Where am I? Methought some angel whisper'd me, and wak'd me: I see it still, but ah! it flies; stay! stay! Divinest vision, that e'er blest my slumbers; 'Tis not a vision, for I grasp her hand! But yet a warmth, a softness all cœlestial Thrills at the touch. O speak, thou wond'rous creature, And tell me what thou art! Arg. An innocent maid, That took thee for another like herself. Forgive the crime of error; quit my hand, Or I shall faint thro' fear. Cur. Why dost thou tremble, Thou matchless paragon? by all the Saints Thou art as safe—as sacred— Arg. But not free, While thus you seize my hand. Cur. Thy pardon, Fairest! It was a boldness nothing, but the fear Of losing thee, could prompt, and for that boldness Such fear must plead excuse. Dost thou forgive? Arg. I do, if so you suffer me to leave you. Cur. Stay but a moment. I'm a wand'ring youth, Whom the wild mazes of this wood misled: You must, for very charity, direct My witless step. Arg. Where art thou bound? Cur. I know not. There would I bide, where I could tend on you, And call you my heart's idol. Arg. Cease, bold Youth! I must not hear thee. Cur. Thou would'st hear, fair Nymph, All this and more from him, that happy youth, For whom while slumb'ring here it was so late Thy error, and my bliss, that I should pass. O for the wealth of this, and ev'ry isle The broad sea circles; I would give it all To be that youth! Arg. In sooth you wrong me, Stranger, I know none such. Cur. Indeed! Arg. Or if I do, 'Tis one whom, finding, I should call my brother, Cur. Would I were then that brother! No, not that; It is too cold a wish; can brothers feel That throbbing extacy, that trembling ardor, That wraps me from myself, fires all my soul, And tells me thou art dearer far than sister, Father, or friend, dearer than life itself? Arg. Ah! hope not, Youth, tho' practis'd as thou seem'st, More than enough, in all those flattering arts That false men use to guile unwary maids; Hope not to win my credence to a tale So palpable and gross: we are but now, Some moments past, first met, and me thou lov'st (Shame on thy fabling tongue) dearer than life. Cur. I do, and call the sweet celerity, With which I love, best witness of its truth. Say, I had seen thee once (if possible) And but approv'd thy beauties; if at second, Third, or some after meeting, love had grown From that approof, I then had school'd my heart, And question'd its tame motions, call'd in Judgment To weigh in her slow scale the due degree Of my cool passion. No, thou sylvan wonder, I saw thee, and I lov'd without one pause 'Twixt sight and love; and I must love thee ever, Because I lov'd so soon. Arg. And do I stay To hear thee? Cur. Why not stay? the blessed spirits, That rove yon realms of light, might deign descend To hear a tale of love so chaste as mine, And bear their saintly purity to heav'n Unsullied as it came. Arg. Was I, like them, Secure from mortal frailness, trust me, Youth, I would not bid thee peace; but as I am A simple maid, whose very simpleness Makes her (so set with snares is this bad world) Only the readier prey, I must not hear thee; Indeed I must not. Fare thee well, good Youth! A gentle one thou seem'st, and, sooth to say, Such as, if chance had fixt thee in this vale My rural neighbour, I had been well pleas'd To call a friend, Cur. O! call me so, sweet Maid, And I will ever— Arg. Hear me out, kind stranger, I said, had chance so fixt thee, and withal Had'st thou with that same rustic shamefac'dness Demean'd thyself as simple shepherds use, Nor dar'd to talk, but of our flocks and herds, Or healing roots, their properties, and powers, And which is found on hills, which loves to dip Its tendrils on the stream—which flaunts on meads, And such like innocent themes—but this thy rashness, Not to say boldness, now has all undone, And therefore must I leave thee. Cur. Stay thee, Nymph, Or let me follow thee! Arg. I have an uncle, With whom I dwell, who, should he meet thee, Youth, Would chide thy frowardness. Cur. Ah! let him chide, So thou but pitiest me. Arg. And canst thou hope it? Cur. Ah! why not hope from thee, what I might hope From yon bright throne of mercy? pity thence Falls on the penitent. Forgive then, fairest, This first offence; and tho' I love thee still To desperation—do not fly—my tongue Shall ne'er again declare it. Stay, my Fair, I'll talk alone of flocks, and flowers, and herbs, So thou but listen me: and art thou gone? I dread thy frown as death, yet more than death I dread thy absence; therefore I'll pursue thee. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Changes to another Part of the Valley near the Hermitage. Enter EDITHA followed by the FALCONER. EDITHA. Begone, false traitor! blessings on the man, Whoe'er he be, that shackled thus thy arms! Unbind them, ruffian? no, justice forbids Thy suit, and prudence too. I will not aid thee. Fal. Nay sweet, dear lady, untie but this one hard knot, that cramps my wrist so miserably, (was I to tell her that Lord Oswald tied it 't would stand me but in small stead, therefore I'll hide that part of the story) [aside] now for mercy's sake, most gentle lady (for that fair face of your's bespeaks you to be a gentle lady, far more truly than my rough one declares me a false traitor) do but suffer your white hands to condescend to so charitable an office, and I will follow you ever after thro' this dreary wilderness, like a tame spaniel; nay, on occasion, be your bold mastiffe, to defend you from wrong and robbery. Ed. O my disastrous fate! I've miss'd the path, Pursued by this vile spy of wicked Edel. Whither to turn I know not, or how drive This miscreant from me. Ha! a hut is near: The hallow'd rood fixt on its thatched top Speaks it the cell of some sage solitary. What if I seek asylum for a while Beneath his lonely roof! The good old man, For Christian charity, will guide me hence, When my spent limbs have rested me awhile. Nay, he perchance, in pity to my case, May force this knave to leave me. [Raps at the door of the Cell. Holy Sir! A young and toil-worn traveller invokes Your aid, and from your saintly orisons Is fain to steal a moment, not mispent, If giv'n in charity to help the wretched. He answers not. He is not in the cell. Yet thro' this wicker grate I spy his beads, His book, and lamp, the oil yet burning in it. Let me attempt the latch: it is not barr'd; He cannot be far off. I'll venture in. Fal. Now that would not I do for a King's ransom; for should she in his absence venture but to touch his breviary or any of his holy geer, she may chance be struck with a dead palsey for the sacrilege. I have often heard of such misadventures. I shall however take no harm, I trust, if I stand here at this due distance and watch the upshot. But here comes the old hermit, and a fine long, white, venerable beard is he blest withal; eighty years growth, I'll warrant it: Yet walks he withal as upright as a wand. This comes of temperance and spare diet! I shall never look half so well at his years. Enter EDWIN. Ed. I've trod yon path in vain. The Envoy's son, I look'd, must have been here by early dawn, And now the golden sun has half-way reach'd His noontide summit. Some mischance, I fear— Who have we here? His face I know full well, 'Tis the King's Falconer; there be spies abroad. Who art thou, Yeoman, and what ruffian hand Has thus enthrall'd thee? Fal. Alas! holy Father, we live in such bad times, that nobles may be called ruffians, acting as thou seest, thus ruffian like. In few words, I am neither more nor less than his Majesty's Yeoman Falconer, come hither, I trow, on no disloyal errand, but to detect disloyalty in the person of a certain great Earl, who, for reasons best known to himself, has feloniously decoy'd from our court the fair Princess Argentile. I have already, ev'n under the hinderance of these vile gyves, found means to come up with one stray kid of the flock, namely the Lady Editha. Ed. Stupendous chance! and where— Fal. Now, would your holiness please to untie these bonds and lend me the key of your cell, I would instantly make her my prisoner, for in that cell have I kennel'd her. Ed. The Lady Editha, and in my cell; Say'st thou in very truth? Fal. Nay, was you to see her, you might chance to think me a liar; for her present humour is to man it in a green jerkin and hose, but I spy'd her thro' all her disguises; therefore would'st thou but assist me in detaining her 'twould be the making of us both; as for your sanctity, I could promise in the king's name to dub you an abbot: for myself, as being no clerk, I shall be content with simple knighthood. Ed. Peace, fellow, peace. Let me reflect awhile— It must not be. This meeting is too sudden; It might o'ercome her spirits; yet to hide My transports much exceeds a mortal's power. O you, ye radiant tutelary Powers, That rule our destinies, arm, arm my soul With your own prudence! make me for a while That old and wither'd anchorite I seem! Chill the warm tide of joy, that boils within me! Be all my passions mortified and dead, Till reason bids them wake to life and rapture! It is resolved. I still will be disguis'd. Now to the interview—Villain, approach not! If thou but stirr'st one step nearer yon threshold, I've spells within shall shrivel up thy limbs, As lightning blasts the oak! [Exit Edwin. Fal. Yes truly, and I doubt it not; for there be many of these solitaries, who, holy as they may seem, amuse themselves now and then with as unhallowed a trade as downright witchcraft. Now, if the sight of a young wench in that lonely place should conjure up a devil in his own breast! But 'tis ill talking of the devil; see where he comes— Enter OSWALD. Osw. Knave, are we met again? Fal. In sooth, noble Sir, this second meeting was none of my seeking, whatever the first was; and ev'n then I never wish'd to meet you single-handed. Osw. I then indeed did leave my work half done; I now will finish it. Thy feet no longer Shall crawl at large; they too shall have their fetters. Fal. Have ye no bowels? this exceeds the barbarity of a Turk or an infidel. Help, good father, help! will you see a good Christian murder'd in the very purlieus of your holy place? Re-enter EDWIN. Ed. What bloody business, in the face of day, Does the arch fiend of darkness now attempt, To stain our holy sanctuary? avaunt! Whate'er thou art. (Just Heav'ns, it is my father! This day doth teem with wonders) [Aside. Gracious beard, Conceal me from his knowledge! [Aside. Whence? what art thou, That thus, in fierce and menacing act, assault'st This peaceful traveller? Osw. I know him, Seer, To be a villain, and a dangerous spy. I am an honest yeoman, and I bide I' th' neighb'ring valley. Fal. 'Tis I, good sir Hermit, that am the honest yeoman, and he, saving his nobility, no better than a false— Osw. Be silent, knave, or this avenging blade Shall nail thy tongue fast in thy traitor jaws. Poor coward, may'st thou hope that this same hermit, Thus old, thus palsied, if he dar'd to aid thee, Could shield thee from my fury! Fal. Why indeed it must needs be said, when one feels that plaguy strong twist of your honour's wrist, that one cannot have much hope of that in a natural way; but if he was so minded, being a holy man, he might by his prayers—and yet after all, it may be as well now at once to yield to thee at discretion. [Oswald binds his feet. Ed. Take not his life. Osw. I do not mean it, Father. I'll but secure the knave from further mischief. Fal. Look ye, my Lord, noble yeoman I mean, whatever mischief might have been in my intention, as we are all sinners you know, I have done you none in practice. I told you one piece of news, you know, that pleas'd you so much, that you pinion'd my arms for it, and now that you have shackled my legs I could tell you another, that would please you still better. But this I do not mean, unless you will set both at their liberty. Osw. Give me thy news, and let me judge its worth. Fal. Know then, that the princess's gentlewoman is— but will you in very deed promise me my freedom? Ed. There is no need. I without fee will speak The rest; she now is lodg'd in yonder cell. Fal. Methinks now, master Hermit, you might, in charity to my pitiful plight, have suffer'd me to make some small profit by my own secret. Osw. Haste, call her forth. Ed. Alas, Sir, long fatigue Has much exhausted her too tender frame! Ev'n now my skill was charitably bent On brewing cordials, which might best restore Her strength and spirits. Osw. Trust me, holy Father, I am her best physician. Lead me to her. Ed. Wait but a little hour. Osw. No, I must see Her instantly; for she is dear to me. Ed. Dear to thee! O repeat the blessed word! What has my rashness utter'd? [Aside, having through joy altered his voice into its natural tone in the preceding line. Osw. Sure that voice— And yet it cannot be; Heav'ns, how I tremble! It pierc'd my very soul! surely it came Thro' the thin air, not from his aged organs; But still it was the voice of my lost Edwin. [Leaning against the side of a rock. Ed. Hence with disguise! it was indeed thy Edwin's; For thou hast call'd him thine. [Pulling off his beard. Osw. This is too much! [Falling into his Son's arms. Strengthen me, Heav'n, to bear it! Ed. O my Father! Osw. My Son, my Son, words cannot speak my transport! Lead me into thy mansion. Ed. Pause a while, And bless me on this spot with your forgiveness; Or on this spot again reject your son! Osw. Reject thee, Edwin! Ed. Yes, Sir, here this instant! Nay take the very life-blood, which ye gave me, But take it here; for Editha as yet Knows not I live, therefore she will not weep. Osw. But she shall weep, and weep such tears as these. See how they course, my Boy, down these old cheeks! Dost pardon me, Edwin? I see thou dost. Thy Editha is thine; this hand shall join you. Let's to the happy business. Haste, my Son, This is a meeting of that wond'rous sort, As seems contrived by holier agents far Than common chance. Ed. It is, and my full soul Piously thanks their holy agency. Yet, Sir, if I reveal myself thus rashly To tender Editha, I fear me much— Osw. Fear nothing, Son! at such a fateful time He acts the best, who acts upon the sudden, And is but engine to the purposes Of those supernal workers, who disdain The aid of our weak reason; nay, perchance, May frown if it submits not to their guidance. —But who comes here? Enter a DANE. Dane. The Danish envoy, Father, Commends him to your benizon, and asks For tidings of his son. Ed. Hence, Sir, with speed, And tell him, tho' that son be not return'd, I shall full soon attend him at his tent With news of special moment. [Exit Dane. I not doubt, [To Oswald. The princess, Sir, is lodg'd in safety near us. Osw. She is—and soon as I have seen my daughter.— Ed. O, Sir, this goodness overcomes me wholly! What shall I do or say? Osw. Follow me, Boy, Into the cell. A moment there shall show How kindly I will own her for my child, How make her thine for ever. Then, my Son, I'll with thee to the strand, salute the Envoy, And plan, while Heav'n beholds us with a smile, How best to avenge the wrongs of Argentile. END OF THE FOURTH ACT. ACT V. SCENE I. Scene on the Sea-Shore, at the Entrance of the Ambassador's Tent, with the Danish Fleet lying at anchor. Enter SEWOLD with an OFFICER. SEWOLD. Say'st thou, not yet return'd? Away with hope! It cannot be but some untoward chance Has foil'd his cunning; haply the poor Prince, Fetter'd and famish'd in some loathsome dungeon, Calls me to succour him. He shall not call In vain. Haste, Gothmund; disembark the troops, I'll lead them to the Castle. [Exit Officer. Coming thus In menacing guise, with such an armament, Suddenly on the king, he must, thro' fear, Give up my royal charge. Yet must I still Conceal his lineage, lest the tyrant prove Unwilling to give up a prize so precious. Meanwhile, if Oswald brings the princess here, Who shall receive her?—Hark! the sound of steps, Haply the Prince—No 'tis the youthful hermit. Enter OSWALD and EDWIN. Ed. Heav'n and its peace protect thee, noble Dane! Behold a Saxon, who, tho' mean in garb, Is rich in blood and honour. He comes fraught With tidings, that import thee much to know. Admit him quickly to thy tent. Sew. As friends, I pray ye, enter both. Ed. Not so, my Lord I'll wait without. His private business told, If it then seem thee meet to use my service, Ev'n to its best that service shall be your's. Sew. I thank thee, and retire. [Exeunt Sewold and Oswald. Ed. Indulgent stars! Thus far beyond all hopes your fav'ring aspect Has crown'd my wish. The mistress of my soul, My Editha is mine! A father's smile Gives sanction to our loves. What now remains, But that, obsequious to the call of justice, We spirit up the Dane to quell the tyrant? And see, full well I deem to aid our purpose, Forth from the swelling sides of yon proud vessel An armed band is pour'd; another yet, And yet a third yields up her martial burthen! Enter OFFICER and SOLDIERS. I'll hail their leader—Benedicite, Brave Warrior! may a peaceful anchorite, Unus'd to sights like these, ask with due deference Wherefore ye quit your anchor'd ships, and why, Your bright helms glittering to the golden sun, Ye march in shew of dread hostility? Offi. Lord Sewold, Envoy of illustrious Denmark, So wills. Ed. And may I crave your numbers, valiant Dane? Offi. Five thousand strong: Men whose try'd hardihood Full oft have cop'd with twice that number, Father, Unfoil'd; for never yet on hostile shore Did they descend, but Victory sat and smil'd Cresting their sable raven. Trust me, Seer, This is no wordy vaunt. Ed. I will not think it; For, to my judgment, never march'd a train, Whose noble bearings more bespoke their prowess. Each common bowman treads with that firm step, Might fit a spearman. Offi. Hermit, thou say'st well; For these be men cull'd from our veteran troops To honour what was meant an embassage Of peace and amity; but now, it seems, We must to our old trade, to blows and bloodshed. We know our craft. You, Captain, to the right; You to the left, and wedge in closer file. Now mount the raven, bid the trumpet speak. Ed. Transporting sound! the glorious clangor thrills Thro' every nerve. Off with these weeds of sloth! I am, I feel myself once more a soldier! [Throws off his disguise and appears in armour. Offi. Hah! what is this my hoary beadsman chang'd To a stout well-arm'd champion? by your leave, Young butterfly just broke from wint'ry slough, I mean to pinch your wings. Guards, seize the spy! Ed. Off, Sirs, and know me for the friend of Denmark! Offi. A foe might say as much; but where's the Dane Would take him at his word? Art not a Saxon? Ed. I am. Offi. And therefore, stubborn Sir, my prisoner— Ed. I cannot blame thy caution, plain-tongu'd soldier; Therefore, till noble Sewold quits his tent, I yield me patiently. Offi. Patience on choice, Or force, it matters not; thou must be patient: Yet, if Lord Sewold owns thee for his friend, Thy durance will be short, for see he comes! Enter OSWALD and SEWOLD. Osw. This is a gallant sight, it glads my soul— But where is Edwin? Ed. Here, Sir, and, if freed, Ready to serve the Dane, and in that duty My father, queen, and country. Sew. What is this? [Seeing Edwin detained by the Guards. Release him, guards, and let me clasp his valour. Know, Earl, while yet this son was lost to thee, He was my courteous host, and in his prudence, Join'd with his heritage of thy known honour, I so confide, that, let him give the word, And I, and all these veterans will obey His brave behests. Behold, ye men of Denmark, Into the valiant grasp of this young Lord I place my staff of office! Denmark's weal Prompts me to this: as second in command, Be it my pride to join him. Sound the clarion, And hail brave Edwin general. [Flourish and shout. Ed. Noble Dane! Thou shalt not find this weighty trust repos'd In idle hands. My deeds shall speak my thanks. My Father—need I to remind your care Of absent Editha? Osw. I'll go, my Son, And lodge her safely with her royal mistress: Yet, ere I go, thus let me clasp thee to me, And call down blessings with a father's favour On thy dear head, thy troops, and their just cause. Yet mark me, Son, when secret thou hast brought These veterans near the walls, I deem it best Thou should'st dismiss some trusty spy to Aldred, Our honour'd kinsman, captain of the guards; So, on the instant when thy valour spreads Th' assault without, he, by revolt within, May seize the citadel: this, if thou dost, (And to this end my letters have prepar'd him) Success is certain. Ed. I will lay the council Close to my heart. Thy blessing, Father! Now, Envoy, I'm thine. Come on, ye Danish lions, I'll lead you to your prey! A wily tyrant Shall fall beneath the fangs of your just vengeance, Tame as the coward stag! [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. A Cottage in another part of the Valley. Out of a Wood on one side enter CURAN. [CURAN] There in yon copse beneath a spreading elm, The night did pass upon my slumbering head, And scatter'd, as she went, from her dun wing Full many a dream; wild and disjointed all, Yet pleasing: for they all, in colours bright Of heaven's own pencilling, did picture her, Whom only heav'n can image. Now, methought, A visionary bark with streamers gay, Its oars still beating time to warbling harps, Bore us to Denmark. Sudden now the scene Was shifted, and a cot mantled with joy Was all our kingdom; yet we there seem'd crown'd With more than kingly blessings. At the dawn I rose, and shook the night-dew from my vest, Then from yon meadow with attentive care I cull'd the choicest flowers for scent or hue, And wove them in this garland. When my fair one Quits yonder homely cabbin, (far, alas! Too homely to enshrine so rich a saint) This path she needs must take. Here then I'll drop The fragrant pledge, in hope that she may bless Its weaver by the wearing. To my wish The wicket opens; 'tis her lovely self! She comes, she comes! Thou friendly thicket shroud me. [He retires. Enter ARGENTILE. Alas! alas! the morn is far advanc'd, And yet no tidings come of loyal Oswald, Or my dear Editha. What's this, a chaplet? Not the dear Maid herself could better sort Its hues, or with more careless grace combine. I'll place it on my brow. But let me pause; No rustic hand has thus arrang'd these buds, This is no forest workmanship. It claims A nicer weaver. I might guess and come Near to the mark of truth, if I pronounc'd That comely youth its maker, who of late So long address'd my too indulgent ear. A forester he seem'd, yet sure his phrase Spoke him of gentle lineage. Blushing blooms; There may be guileful snakes hid in your perfume: I dare not use your decking. Lie thou there, Sweet wreath; and may some happier maid, with brow Unshent by care, adopt your gay adornings; They suit not with my sadness. CURAN, starting from the Thicket. Cur. So, sweet Maid, Ev'n so, as that fair hand discards my wreath, Your cruel heart disdains my constancy! Arg. I did not err. Go, Youth, take back thy flowers, Fit emblem of thy sexes constancy. Both are but born to fade. Cur. Thus to decide Is all too harsh a sentence. If on me Thy frown inflicts it, thou shalt find it false, Ev'n tho' for life impos'd. Arg. Go, flattering Stranger, And sooth some simpler damsel with the tale. Thy truth or falshood to my absent ear Will be the same; reckless alike of both. Cur. Wert thou a queen, as well thy beauty merits, Thou would'st rejoice to rule o'er loyal subjects; Ev'n if those subjects ne'er approach'd thy throne. I am thy beauty's vassal, Shroud it from me, I am thy vassal still. Thy frowns or smiles May load my vassalage, or make it easy; Yet still thou art its sov'reign. Arg. Fabling Youth, Each quaint allusion in thy speech bewrays The glossing courtier. The true forester, Who to the turtle's truth compar'd his own, Or match'd his wailings with the nightingale's, Would to my ear his suit more aptly move, And more pathetical, than thy forc'd phrase Set out with royal trimmings. Hie thee hence To some throng'd city. Woo some noble virgin, May relish better with accustomed ear Thy talk of queens and vassals. I the while Will tend my little flock in this still vale, List'ning their rural bleating. Cur. Sylvan wonder, Know, tho' no inmate of these neighb'ring hamlets, I have a soul can taste all rural pleasures, With thee would court them as the choicest blessing Heaven has in store for mortals, or what next To thy fair self was precious! Try me, sweet one! See with what nimble zeal on yonder cliffs I'll seek thy straggling lambs! at close of day How safely pen them in their hurdled cotes? At night how guard them from the prowling wolf? Then ever and anon at sultry noon Shalt thou, o'er-canopied by thickest shade, Recline on this true bosom; while I breathe Light roundelays upon my oaten reed, And lull thee to sweet slumbers. Try me, Fairest; Arg. No more, soft Youth; picture not scenes of bliss, Which, if in very truth thou deem'd'st them such, With me thou ne'er must share. Have I not said My uncle is a stern man and austere? He will not match me with thy alien birth. Cur. “The old have interest ever in their eye;” So says a well-prov'd proverb. Trust me, Virgin, I can a dowery bring will soon o'ercome His scruples, tho' when poiz'd against thy worth The weightiest ingots of each Indian mine Would lightly kick the beam. Arg. Indeed, indeed, My heart is much to blame thus to prolong This tender converse; yet, I know not how, There is a kind of music in his voice, And such a melting mildness in his eye— O that I ne'er had seen him! [Aside. Cur. Turn thee, Nymph! Still let those eyes shed their sweet radiance on me! I live but by thy smiles. The jealous flower, In its true yellow livery, that still turns Where the sun flames, watching his burning course, Then nightly droops the head, as he declines, Best parallels my passion. Arg. Gentle Youth, Thou hast no cause to droop, when I am gone, As now perforce I must. What if, while absent, I dar'd to impose one friendly office on thee? Cur. O bless me with the errand! Arg. I have said, I seek a long-lost brother; could'st thou find him? He pairs thee in complexion, dress, and size, Save somewhat more of slender. Nay, so much Alike, thou know'st I lately took thee for him. He journeys from the north along the flats. Could'st thou from any neighb'ring cliff detect The wand'rer's step, and lead him to this cottage, My smiles should thank thee. Cur. Let me press that hand With these chaste lips, and instant I am gone. For such another bliss, my willing toil Would plough the stormy main. [Exit Curan. Arg. If he succeeds He brings me back my friend, that friend, erewhile, Had with her brought my peace; but now, alas! I fear me much the better half is lodg'd In other hands; yet those are gentle too— Poor Argentile! how wayward is thy fate!— I'll to the grove and weep. [Exit Argentile. SCENE III. Scene changes to the Hermit's Cell. Enter EDITHA from within; the FALCONER at some distance laid on the ground asleep. EDITHA. This is a painful pause; and joy and fear Rule it by turns in my distracted bosom! Perhaps, ev'n now the Princess, steep'd in tears, Laments me lost: Perhaps my late-found love, Now lost to me again, in civil broils Hazards his dearest life. O Patience, Patience! Grac'd, as I am, with Heav'n's unhop'd for favours, Let me not drive thee hence, who still from heav'n Call'st down fresh favours on the trusting wretch, That hugs thee in her bosom. Whence that noise! 'Tis but the sleeping falconer's noisy drone. Sleep on, thou meddling knave. I need not fear thee. Enter OSWALD. Osw. Health to thee, Virgin, and a length of days Prosperous as this beginning! I return To lead you to our queen. Ed. Dread Earl, your son Did say— Osw. He did, that with me he'd return; But business more important, (thanks to Heav'n) Detains him for a while. Thy lover, lady, Is now the Danish general. Ed. O my fears! Osw. Say, dost thou fear? trust me, I too should fear, If I could call his mother's truth in question; But he is mine, legitimately mine, And cannot play the coward. Yes, my Edwin, Thou'lt lop the tyrant's head; I nothing doubt it. Come on, and in our way to Argentile Thou shalt hear more. But first I'll give this spy His liberty. [Unties the Falconer. Rise, Falconer, get thee hence! Go tell thy master thou hast found i'the forest A nest of traitors. Tell him where they're hid, And gain a traitor's guerdon for thy tidings. Haste on, dear Editha. [Exit, pushing out the Falconer. Ed. I do, Sir, tremblingly. SCENE IV. Changes near to Argentile's Cottage. Enter CURAN. I've climb'd yon cliff in vain. This to the right Remains untry'd; yet this way ere I reach it I may, perhaps, again behold that form, Which makes all others viewless. Enter ARGENTILE to him hastily. Arg. Careless Youth! Return'd so soon! return'd without my brother! False one, thou ne'er hast sought him. Cur. Far as eye Could from yon beetling brow detect a gull, So far these eyes have pierc'd, nor saw one glimpse Of human face. But hopeless is the chance, That he, who lost himself is only found Where thou art present, fitly e'er should use Those faculties thy absence takes away: For, absent when thou art, tyrannic fancy Seizes my sight, and fixes in each orb Thy image only. If I spy a rose, It is thy blushing cheek; a crystal rill, It is thy sparkling eye. Each element; Fire, water, air, are tinctur'd with thy features. Gods! she is mute; no sympathetic sigh Gives murmuring proof, that she approves my passion. Why is it thus, O ye remorseless Powers! I've heard that love was ever eloquent; That tongues, how rude soe'er, nay, that dumb eyes Inspir'd by love could speak as plain as tongues, And more persuasively. If this were true, My eyes, my cheeks, each feature had been vocal, And told their tale with such sweet energy It must have been believed. They mock'd me much Who told me this; for I have no such powers. Arg. Thou hast, too eloquent Youth! indeed thou hast! Cur. No, not enough to gain me the cold credence, I love beyond expression. Arg. Think not so: I do believe thou lov'st me. Cur. So believing, Canst thou then cruelly reject that love, Because 'tis offer'd by a nameless lover? I heretofore did boast that I was rich; That boast did fail to move thee. To say more, Know, that my birth is noble. Will that truth Avail me? will my fairest meet my wishes, When I declare this hand, this heaving heart, That sue to join in marriage bonds with hers, Are ev'n of royal lineage? Arg. Ha! what say'st thou? Cur. That I'm a Prince; and yet so much I love thee, I'll bear my sweet, my simple shepherdess Swift to my father's court, make her my bride, Clothe her in gold and purple: orient pearls, 'Stead of those meadow flowers, shall braid her hair. Good Heav'ns! she weeps. Is it a cause for tears, That thou behold'st thus prostrate at thy feet A heart and crown offer'd by Denmark's heir! Arg. By Denmark's heir! Cur. Yes, to the Saxon court He came disguis'd to see its beauteous Princess; (For beauteous, fame had boasted her to be) How, in that aim, his various efforts fail'd Imports but little. He has seen in thee What makes all beauty homely, save thy own. Arg. Heav'ns! is this true? Cur. It is by all the Powers That rule our destinies! they mock at pride. Princes and peasants their impartial scale Holds all in equal balance! 'tis their sport To teach the vain possessors of such toys, As wealth and birth, how little is their worth When laid, as now, an unaccepted gift At the bright shrine of beauty. Arg. Rise, Sir, rise! If thou'rt the Prince of Denmark, fate has been Beyond, whate'er we read in feigned legend, Ingenious to beguile thee. Now, methinks, I almost wish to be that Argentile, You seem to scorn. Cur. Be rather thy fair self, Who canst give more to my transported soul In one sweet smile, than Argentile could bring With all her royal dower. Arg. You ne'er beheld That Princess, Sir. Cur. Nor do I wish it, Fairest! Thou hast such full possession of my soul, That, were she lovely as thy loveliest self, (Impossible to think) it were as easy A single hand should lift some first-rate barque From ocean's breast, and on the timber'd base, Whence late it launch'd, refix its ponderous keel, As snatch my heart from that delicious harbour, Where all my hopes have anchor'd. Arg. Wouldst thou, Prince, Relinquish for my love so vast a dower? Cur. I have, sweet Maid, relinquish'd it already, Ev'n ere thy love be gain'd. Arg. I find thee apt, Great Sir, to part with what the world holds precious: Canst thou still part with more? Cur. No, not with thee: Thou canst not mean it. Dost thou scorn me only Because I am a prince? Arg. I do, and must, While I remain an humble shepherdess. Cur. A village maid has oft been crown'd a queen. Arg. Yet never without loss of happiness. And, trust me, Sir, while I can safely sojourn In this still valley, tend my little flock, Sleep in yon cot, and press this perfum'd bank, I seek no loftier station. Cur. Say not this To him, who, born a prince, has scorn'd his equal, And loves but thee alone. Arg. But can he scorn Himself? I mean his better part of self? Cur. No, for that part art thou. Arg. Mistake me not; I mean thy royalty. Love lives not long Without equality. To love his equal, That prince must be a shepherd. Cur. Be it so. I'll make that change the test of my true passion. I here disclaim all royalty. I'll live In this still valley, tend thy little flock, Sleep with thee in yon cot, and with thee press This perfum'd bank. Arg. O! thou hast won my heart! Away, away with maiden shamefac'dness! I will confess, I love thee. Cur. Take then, Heav'n, Take back again each trivial good ye gave me! Take back superfluous wealth, superfluous grandeur! This, this is all I'll keep; but I will prize it, As monarchs do their crowns! Enter OSWALD and EDITHA from the Path behind, and stand at a distance. OSWALD. Am I awake? What! Argentile lock'd in a rustic's arms! Ed. Patience and silence, Sir; for be assur'd, If he, that was the minstrel, be the Prince, As you have said the Danish Envoy told ye, That same is he. Osw. Say'st thou? O blest event! Arg. Heav'ns, Sir, my uncle! Nay, my brother too! O all ye stars! Permit me, that I meet them; I'll speedily return. Cur. Go, my soul's treasure, But make thy absence short! Peace, peace, my heart, Leap not for very rapture thro' my breast! Patience, fond flutterer! Let me mark their meeting. See, how my Love falls on that brother's neck! I envy him his bliss, tho' he's her brother. And now they hurry both into their cottage. Her uncle this way bends. I'll meet him boldly. He that has honour in his fair intent Can feel no terror from a mortal's frown. Osw. Who art thou, forester? Cur. Whate'er I am, Deem me no foe to thee and thy fair kindred. Osw. I hope thou art not, yet I needs must ask Your business here, and why your ardent gaze Is fixt on yonder cot? Cur. Because that cot Contains the dearest treasure of my soul, A goddess in the semblance of a maid, To whom my love is plighted. Good old man, Admit me to her presence. Osw. That I must not. 'Tis her own wish, I should detain thee here Till she returns. Cur. Away, that cannot be! Did ever turtle wish her mate detain'd— [A flourish of trumpets heard. Osw. What shout was that? Cur. 'Tis Denmark's trumpet sounds! What may this mean? Osw. O, ye propitious stars! Cur. I know that flourish: 'tis the note of conquest. Enter SEWOLD, EDWIN, and SOLDIERS. SEWOLD. My Prince! my Pupil! [Sewold embracing Curan. Ed. O my noble Father! [Falling at Oswald's feet. Accept this sword, steept in the tyrant's blood— Sew. And art thou found at this auspicious moment! Where is thy Queen, thy Argentile? Cur. Good Sewold, I pray thee check this sudden burst of joy, Nor dream of Argentile; she is not here, Nor do I wish.—O that my tongue could croud A thousand thousand thoughts in one short sentence! Give me the hearing. Thou perchance may'st chide; But, know, in this sweet vale I've met a maid— Nay, interrupt me not—she was not born Indeed of noble kin, and, sooth to say, Is but a shepherd's niece. But what of that? Thou know'st, my Sewold, Heav'n's impartial eye (I but repeat thy lecture, wisest Sewold) Notes no distinction in the equal chain, That links humanity. Nature, good herald, Marshals alike the peasant and the prince, And gives the self-same blazon. See, she comes! Mark her, my Sewold, what a modest blush Damasks her cheek. Give me thy judgment, Friend. Is not her rural sweet simplicity Beyond all majesty? withal majestic, Or would be so, if it were for her purpose To put on majesty, but she disdains it. Kneel with me, Sewold, kneel, ye men of Denmark, All kneel, and hail this heavenly maid your queen! Enter ARGENTILE and EDITHA (in a Woman's dress.) ARGENTILE. Rise, Prince, thy looks declare thou wilt not scorn me, Tho' I am Argentile. Cur. Mock not my love! Arg. I do not, Sir; this act shall prove I do not. Mark it, I pray. Behold this faithful maid, Whom late in man's attire I call'd my brother! Behold this gallant warrior! he, whose valour So nobly has aveng'd thy country's wrongs, To him I give her hand. His sire approves The act. See, he devours my snowy gift With all a lover's rapture! [Joining the hands of Editha and Edwin. Cur. As I thine! [Seizing Argentile's hand. Ed. What words shall speak my thanks? Yes, I have words My queen will think even worth so dear a gift. Your father lives. Arg. My father! Osw. Adelbright! Ed. These honour'd hands Did lead him from the convent to the castle. Arg. And in his perfect health? Ed. Of health such share, As his full years allow. Yet strong enough To go to morrow, so his priest had prompted, And wend him to the woods, a solitary— Arg. O Prince! O Oswald! where shall my full heart, O'erburthen'd with its blessings, first select Her theme of praise to Heav'n. First, my best Father, For thy dear life, prolong'd to bless my nuptials, I bow my thankful knee! and next, my Prince, (Nay kneel thou too) bless we the host of saints, For that, by means beyond compare mysterious, They saved us from the curse entail'd on princes, And gave our hearts that rare felicity Of choice in freedom, which they give the peasant! Cur. They did. They lighted the bright torch of love, And bade it blaze ere policy could damp With its chill touch the fervor of the flame. Sew. Blest pair, how will the story of your loves, When born upon the wings of poesy To after ages, call forth envious sighs From all of royal ear that drink the tale? Cur. True, my best Sewold! Now, sweet Argentile, Let's hasten to thy father. Dost thou loiter? Arg. Only to pay these hospitable shades The tribute of my thanks. Farewell, sweet vale! Farewell, ye tranquil shades, where Love was born, And where, did duty not withdraw her step, Love still would wish to sojourn; yet no long Farewell; for soon, in these same pastoral weeds, (If it so please the partner of my soul To join me in the pleasing pilgrimage) I will revisit your dear solitudes. Cur. Yes, Argentile, yes, ye delicious glades! We'll steal a frequent holyday from state, Here to repeat in every different haunt What pass'd in this sweet valley. Thou shalt find me Couch'd by yon babbling rill: thy kiss shall wake me; Then, feigning sweet surprise, here shalt thou fly, And here in amorous chase will I pursue thee: Then shalt thou yield— Arg. Yet not till all that tale Of tender love, which charm'd of late my ear, Be twice told over. Cur. Sweet one! so it shall; And ev'ry time with an increase of ardor. Our love shall be peculiar, as our fate; Time shall not pall it, pageantry and state Quench its first fervor. Hither will we fly, Leaving at court all cares of royalty: Here, shelter'd in our ivy-mantled nest, 'Spite of that royalty, we will be blest. [Exeunt Omnes. SAPPHO, A LYRICAL DRAMA IN THREE ACTS.

Lycidas in love with Doris. Arethusa, a Naiad. Statue of Hymen animated. SCENE SICILY. N. B. The types in the following pages are arranged in the manner of Metastatio's Operas, Paris Edit. 1755, in order to distinguish the Airs, Duetts, &amp;c. from the Recitative. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text. The abbreviations used for major characters are as follows: For Sap. read Sappho; For Ag. read Agenor; For Dor. read Doris; For Lyc. read Lycidas; For Pha. read Phaon. PRELIMINARY SCENE. VENUS and CUPID descend or enter. CUPID. From thy own Cyprus, goddess! on the wing Of duteous zeal I meet thee; from the isle Where ev'ry gale breathes love, where ev'ry shade Weaves a close canopy for fond desire To revel in unsated; where each stream, That leads its mazy silver thro' the mead, Murmurs a strain of liquid minstrelsy Soft as the Dorian lute. Ven. But not so sweet As Sappho's Lesbian lyre, and this to hear I now invite thee. Come, my Son, with me Receive harmonious incense from that lyre; Hear the sweet suppliant, and unite with mine Thy power (if Jove and his stern fates permit) In aid of her distress. Cup. Declare the cause. Ven. Thou dost remember, (for this pensile orb Has not as yet been circled by the sun With annual radiance) since we both were mask'd In shapes of mortal mould, and minded both To pass the Cydnus: near the further bank There lay a rude and homely fisher boy Stretch'd on his rush-wove float, with hook and line 'Guiling the fish that scudded thro' the stream. We call'd him to us, and with willing speed He left his lures, and to the distant shore Gave us safe waftage: with his manner pleas'd And unschool'd courtesy, as soon as landed, I stood confest the goddess; bade him ask What wond'rous boon he pleas'd, and my full power Should instant grant it: the fond youth ask'd beauty; Beauty supreme, to strike the dullest sense, And melt the coldest bosom. Cup. True, he did, And still my recollection marks the change With pleasure mix'd with wonder; his brown forehead, Which the hot sun had parch'd and freckled o'er, Quick took a Parian polish. His rude locks, That stood in bristly tangles round his head, Now smoothly flow'd in hyacinthine rings, Mantling his neck and shoulders; downy crimson Soft'ned his rustic ruddiness of cheek; His eye glanced tenderness; his smile breath'd love. Meanwhile the Graces at thy bidding came, And from their sacred alabaster vase Shed that blest unguent, which to all his limbs (Accordant to proportion's faultless law) Gave new dimensions, only seen before In shapes of heav'nly frame.—But to the tale. Ven. Chang'd as he was, the youth repair'd to Lesbos, Where Sappho saw, and, need I add, ador'd him. For, Cupid, well thou know'st, the tender soul, That Poesy inspires, is very wax To Beauty's piercing ray: the blooming boy, More raptur'd with her lyre than with her form, Feign'd real passion; swore eternal truth. Yet scarce the waning moon had heard his vows, Ere all those vows were broke, and perjur'd Phaon Parted for Sicily; where now he reigns Here like ourselves, my Son, all-absolute, Conquering each heart he lists, nor needs thy shafts To aid his victories. Cup. But what of Sappho? Ven. Disconsolate she sought the darkling grove, Where the lorn nightingale prick'd on her thorn Wails to the list'ning stars, and join'd her plaint With kindred notes as sweetly querulous. And oft her hand would hang upon the trees Sad madrigals, the which my pitying doves Stole from the stems and bore to Phaon's eye, But all in vain: at length, to court my aid, Hither she bends her course. Ev'n while I speak, I spy her glittering bark: see, o'er the waves It rides with fav'ring gale! Our place be now The middle region, where enshrin'd in clouds We'll hear the vot'ry and accept her prayer. [They ascend. NOTE. The above scene is not to be considered as essential to the Drama as it now stands; it was written many years before as a first scene, when the Author intended to throw the story into the form of a Masque; in which a part only (and that a small one) was meant to be set to Music. It is now inserted as a previous narrative of what is fabled concerning the cause of Phaon's superior beauty, (see Elian. Var. Hist. B. 12. C. 18,) and therefore in the closet may be read, by way of what our old Dramatists called an Induction to the Drama itself, though not a necessary part of it. ACT I. SCENE I. A Grove with a view open to the sea on one side, and an elegant Temple dedicated to Venus on the other. While the Overture is performing, a splendid Barge appears on the sea bearing Sappho and her attendants from Lesbos; they land, and approach the Temple; when Sappho takes her Lyre from her principal attendant, and strikes it in accompaniment to her voice. SAPPHO. Immortal Venus! power benign! From this thy gaily-glittering shrine, Daughter of Jove, thy vot'ry hear! O, skill'd in each delusive art, That best beguiles the love-lorn heart, Defend thy Sappho from despair! Come with such willing haste, As oft thou cam'st before, When thy light car thy nimble sparrows bore Thro' the cærulean vast. Forth from thy mighty sire's refulgent hall Swift on their little dusky wings they flew, Propitious to my call, And gave thee to my dazzled view. Raptur'd I mark'd each radiant grace, That beam'd in thy celestial face; I saw thee smile; I heard thy tongue The soft consoling strain prolong; “What from my power would Sappho claim? “Who scorns thy flame? “What wayward boy “Disdains to yield thee joy for joy? “Soon shall he court the bliss he flies; “Soon beg the boon he now denies, “And, hast'ning back to love and thee, “Repay the wrong with extacy.” Ah, gentle Goddess! once again Repeat the soft consoling strain: My queen, my patroness, my friend, Again thy powerful influence lend; Relieve me from these dire alarms, And give my Phaon to my arms! This first scene is a free translation of Sappho's Hymn to Venus preserved by Dionysius. [The Hymn ended, she takes from another of her attendants two Doves, and with the rest of her train enters the Temple.] SCENE II. AGENOR, DORIS. Dor. In pity hear me! Ag. No, my soul's resolved; I will not yield to this proud Lesbian youth Thy beauty, or my wealth. Dor. Nor do I hope it. Ag. Why then admit vain Phaon to thy bower? Dor. In duty to the goddess of this fane, I must admire the form she made so fair; On whom she lavish'd more enchanting grace Than deck'd her own Adonis. Ag. And for this, Ev'n for the gloss and varnish of complexion, Is virtuous Lycidas, with coy disdain, Banish'd thy presence. Dor. To the shepherd's merit I give my heart's esteem. Ag. 'Tis a cold tribute: The youth deserves thy love, and once possest it. But mark my words; I led thee here to mark them. Lo! at this fane I swear, not to survive The day thou wed'st with Phaon. Dor. Dearest Sire! Recall the word. Ag. Daughter, the vow is made; Jove, when he swears by sable Styx, not binds His oath more firmly. Dor. Hear me but a moment— Ag. Away—discard all duty—marry Phaon— Yet, in the hour of transport, Doris, know A father's death shall turn thy bliss to woe. The Furies from their Hell shall start, And thunder to thy trembling heart, That then thy father died; Shall dash with guilt and shame the hour, When Phaon to the nuptial bower Leads thee, a willing bride. [Exit Agenor. SCENE III. DORIS. Tremendous threat! yet justly given to her, Who, tho' she knows the force of filial duty, Knows the dear tribute due to faithful love; To both must live a debtor. Death alone Must aid me. Crimes we ought, yet cannot, hate Are only cancell'd by the stroke of Fate. Ye virgin shades, relieved from pain, That in Elysian vallies rove! Ah! take me to your pensive train, Victims like me of hopeless love! Lead to the glades where, softly slow, Oblivion's Lethe steals along: There let me join your warbling woe, Or sigh responsive to your song. [Exit Doris. SCENE IV. LYCIDAS, and afterwards SAPPHO, from the Temple. Lyc. Stay, Nymph! she hears me not—or hearing flies me, Perchance, to follow Phaon. O my spear, That oft hast on the felon wolf repaid His outrage on my fold, prepare thy point To quell a baser robber! Sap. What is this? A youth of wild demeanor: yet, methinks, He has not long been thus. His eye, tho' fir'd With rage, has yet a tenderness withal, That speaks his bosom gentle. Hapless youth, Perhaps, the nymph he loves has been unkind! What if I question him? Stay, courteous Swain? A stranger sues thy converse. Lyc. Thou'rt a woman I have forsworn the sex. Sap. 'Tis as I fear'd; Love has done this; yet hear me, tho' a woman, I never did thee wrong: in pity tell me Where Lesbian Phaon sojourns. Lyc. Phaon, sayst thou? O that this spear were buried in his breast; Sap. Venus forbid! what, wouldst thou murder Phaon? Lyc. I would, but dare not: lest a deadlier frown From Doris should avenge the righteous blow. Sap. And loves he Doris? Lyc. That his trait'rous heart Can only tell: enough for me to know, That Doris, won by his delusive wiles, Disdains my virtuous passion. Gracious gods! Why sleeps your vengeance? why, at truth's just call, Does not destruction's bolt on falsehood fall? Is there not thunder in the sky? Lightning, of pale and livid glare, Prepar'd the perjur'd breast to tear, And prove that justice reigns on high? Fall then, dread meteors, from above! Ye whirlwinds rush; ye tempests growl; And wreck on Phaon's impious soul, The fury of offended Jove! [Exit Lycidas. SCENE V. SAPPHO. Ah, I have heard enough! he loves another; And she (as needs she must; so absolute His beauty's sov'reignty) returns his passion. I look'd for this; and therefore did I bring, Lodg'd in my bark, the vestments of a shepherd, In these I'll veil my sex; adieu my lyre! Tho' sweeter than the harp, than gold more dear, ???? ???????? ????????????, ????? ?????????. Frag. Sapphûs ap. Demet. Phalereum. Awhile must I resign thee; and inform The liquid languor of Sicilian reed To breathe as I inspire! Yet if the powers, That Phœbus gives me, like their Author prove, With this I'll woo; I'll win my rival's love. Parent of Harmony descend! The Muse's and the Lover's friend; Thro' melody's meand'ring tide Let sense and sound united glide; Link in thy sympathetic chain The tend'rest thought, the softest strain, And lead the touching tones along Thro' ev'ry melting mood of song; So shall the tuneful contest prove, That Music rules the realms of Love. [Exit Sappho. SCENE VI. Changes to an enclosed Lawn with a bower in the centre ornamented with festoons of flowers. Enter PHAON. This is her bower; and this the time agreed. Doris was ever punctual to the moment; Nay even forewent it: should she fail me now, My careless heart tells me it well could brook A longer absence; lovely as she is, And unenjoy'd, I feel already sated. Ah, rapt'rous Sappho! wherefore did I leave thee! Thine was a soul of fire. Others can love, But not like thee: this Doris owns a passion, But thou alone couldst feel it: Joy in her, In thee was extacy. I left thy arms To gain fresh taste for their superior charms. The bee that roves round every field, And sips the balm that each bestows, For sweets, that common cowslips yield, Resigns the nectar of the rose; But, when the transient feast is o'er, He seeks the rose he left behind, And finds, in the forsaken flower, Both nectar and ambrosia join'd. But see where Doris comes: health to my fair one, And love, and transport! SCENE VII. DORIS, PHAON. Dor. Rather fear, and torture; For these alone possess the heart of Doris. Pha. What? when I meet thee? when thy Phaon's lips Print on this hand, this fervent seal of love? Dor. Forego the hand, that never must be thine: A father's frowns— Pha. Weigh'd with his daughter's smiles Are light as air to Phaon: such to thee Should be those frowns, when weigh'd with Phaon's love, Dor. If Phaon lov'd me with a worthy passion, He would not counsel thus. Pha. When filial duty Contends, as now it seems, with faithful Love, One must be scorn'd. Dor. But Doris has a heart, (And hence arises all her misery) That can scorn neither. Pha. Then the love of Phaon Has not that force, that interest in thy bosom, He once had cause to hope. Dor. Cruel! it has; Thou know'st it has; thou hear'st it in my sighs; Thou see'st it in my tears; my voice declares it. Go with the pleas'd conviction, that thy charms Have made poor Doris wretched: place her name The last, the lowliest in the suff'ring list, Thy beauty has enslav'd: let Lesbian Sappho Hold, as she ought, the highest. Pha. Jealousy, Not duty, there prompted the cold reproof. Dor. I meant not to reprove thee; would to Heav'n, That never from that Sappho's am'rous breast, Thy faith had parted! then I had not seen thee, And had not been undone. No father's frown (As now it does) had spread confusion round me; No virtuous lover mourn'd my cruelty. But, as it is, thy pity I implore, Quitting those charms I ever must adore. 'Tis duty, Phaon, bids me fly The heav'n of smiles, that decks thy face, And ev'ry more than mortal grace, That triumphs in thy eye. Yet mem'ry ev'ry grace and smile Shall hoard, as misers do their store, And these, till life's vain dream be o'er, My sorrows shall beguile. [Exit Doris. SCENE VIII. PHAON. She goes, in hope I should pursue her step To her stern father's presence; and, with prayer, And bended knees, and supplicating hands, Implore a boon, that I can gain without it. No, Lesbian poetess! Apollo's daughter! Phaon, whose charms once freely won thy heart, Disdains the thought. And thou, bright Queen of Love! Who gav'st me beauty to support thy reign, Shalt find that gift was not bestow'd in vain. From fair to fair in ev'ry isle, That lifts its forests from the wave, I'll rove, their beauties to inslave; The coyly grave, The freely gay, Shall each be victims to my smile; I'll woo them all, perplex, beguile, Possess, and fling the toys away. Too long has woman wore the crown, And rul'd with love's resistless power: 'Tis time, that man should have his hour, To reign a tyrant in his turn. So shall the swains, that dayly sigh With unavailing passion true, In Phaon their avenger view, And hail his am'rous victory. This air is meant to be set en Rondeau, and the first eight lines repeated. END OF THE FIRST ACT. ACT II. SCENE I. A Grove near the House of Agenor. AGENOR, DORIS, LYCIDAS. Ag. Hence from my sight! or with repentant speed Restore thy heart to Lycidas. Dor. My hand ('Tis all I can) I yield him. Ag. See, the swain With virtuous pride disclaims it! Lyc. Not from pride, But grief, Agenor, I decline a gift, That Doris yields so coldly. Dor. Take it, Youth, And know, tho' Phaon claims my adoration, He ne'er shall be thy rival. If his charms Surpass (as sure they do) whate'er is human, May I not pay to him that tribute chaste, We give to bright Apollo? Lyc. But his heart, Wayward and false; his bold licentious tongue; Does that bespeak divinity? Ag. If so, 'Tis such as frights us in the Satyr troop, That follow Faunus, or the Cyclops rude, Which oft, at eve, from Etna's burning womb Are seen to climb, and cool them on yon cliff, Carolling strains uncouth. Lyc. Or boldly daring, Like ruthless Polypheme, to lure the faith Of one more heav'nly fair than Galatea From one, as true as Acis. Dor. Hapless Youth! Much do I pity thee, and much myself. Yet all I can, in offering here my hand, I give thee. Ah! my Father, check thy frowns. Ag. Away! my soul thy perfidy disowns. Fly to the Lesbian traytor, fly! Forsake the mansion of thy Sire: From fair Sicilia's plains retire, And take an exile's destiny. The dower of penury and pine, Giv'n by a father's curse, be thine! [Agenor and Doris exeunt different ways. SCENE II. LYCIDAS. Agenor, stay! my heart releases Doris From all her vows, so thou forgiv'st her crime. He hears me not. Ah, lost, lost Lycidas! And, if he heard thee, could'st thou yield the nymph To impious Phaon? lov'd as thou hast been, Canst thou, reflecting on that love, resign That bliss to him, which should alone be thine? Ah! how the Hours, on golden plume, Flew lightly o'er this fragrant shade, Where, with my lovely Doris laid, I cropt the rose, and woodbine's bloom, To weave a garland for her head. O cruel change! the tempests lour! The roses droop, the woodbines fade! Falsehood and Fraud have seiz'd the bower, And robb'd me of my darling Maid! SCENE III. LYCIDAS, SAPPHO (disguised as a Shepherd.) Sap. Shepherd, I kindly greet thee! Lyc. Whence—what art thou? Methinks I made acquaintance with thy face This morning near the temple; but thy garb Then spoke thee female. Sap. True; and such I am, A nymph of Lemnos. Lyc. Thy resplendent galley Glittering with streamers, and thy numerous train Bespoke thee noble. Sap. True; but what avails Or birth, or wealth, when love, when bliss is lost; When Phaon has deceiv'd me? Lyc. Heav'ns! another Inthrall'd as Doris? Sap. Yes, and to release Doris from thraldom, to avenge myself, And blast his perfidy, I mask me thus In man's attire. Conduct me swift to Doris. Lyc. Ah! what will that avail? Sap. Know, gentle Swain, I boast no vulgar skill in minstrelsy, And mean by that to win her heart from Phaon, And make it mine. That done, from such a bond (My sex declar'd) thou shalt thyself reclaim That truant heart, and fix it thine for ever. Lyc. Impossible! ye gods, that I could hope it! O! she too madly doats on Phaon's beauty; Yet thou art beauteous too; and in thy eye There sits a soft and modest tenderness, Which more, methinks, should move a virgin's mind, Than Phaon's wanton glances. Sap. Not on that Shall I depend, which had not power to keep My Phaon faithful; but my surer hope Springs from my soul, and its enchanting art Which, while it sooths, inflames each hearer's heart. Whate'er of sacred magic reigns In verse and heav'n-born harmony, I mix in my melodious strains: Apollo hears me from his sky; Thro' music's maze he guides the song, Obsequious to my tuneful call; Now lifts the swelling sounds along; Now sinks in a pathetic fall. Lyc. Never till now did my rapt ear imbibe Such strains celestial: the tun'd spheres themselves, That o'er our heads ring their immortal chime, To the blest gods give not more extacy, Than thou to Lycidas! it must succeed. Come on, sweet Lemnian Syren; swift I'll lead thee To the fair bower, which Doris haunts at noon. SCENE IV. Changes to another part of the Grove. AGENOR, PHAON. Ag. The guilty ever fly from those they fear; But I have found, and, finding thee, command Thy quick departure: Sicily disdains To harbour falsehood. Vengeance here awaits Thy crimes. Begone, and by thy flight avoid Thy doom. Pha. Unconscious of those crimes, old man, Why should I fly? Ag. Thou hast seduc'd my daughter. Pha. I have won Thy daughter's heart, and, having won, will keep it. Agenor, know, I am no vulgar suitor! I own, what well may justify my claim To nymphs as rich as Doris. Ag. Wert thou wealthy As Lydian Crœsus, I would scorn thy suit: I've given her to another. Pha. 'Tis a grant, Which parents have not in their power to give; Else why have I her heart? thou didst not give it, And yet 'tis mine. Ag. Insolent wretch! I'll hear No more. If the next rising sun Beholds thee here, thy punishment's begun. The rat'ling chain, the prison's gloom, Where adders hiss, and scorpions sting, Villain, shall be thy dismal doom! There Famine, on her raven wing, Shall hover o'er thy fainting head; Till Nature, shrinking at the sight, Quenches the lamp of life and light, And gives thee to the perjur'd dead. [Exit Agenor. SCENE V. PHAON. Sternly he threatens, and has power confest To put those threats in practice. I will haste To Doris: press her, ere the morning dawns, To fly with me to Cyprus. My trimm'd bark Already is unmoor'd; my ship-mates ready; And the breeze blows, as if it wish'd to speed My am'rous theft, and sanctify the deed. Fill'd with each wanton zephyr's gale My nimble bark shall spread its sail, And cut the wave with prow of gold: Around it's keel young dolphins play; Triumphant Tritons lead the way; And laughing Love the helm shall hold. [Exit Phaon. SCENE VI. Changes to the Bower of Doris. DORIS. Ye solitary shades, once more receive Your love-lorn visitant! Let my poor limbs Fall on your fragrance! O that they might soon Sink into sleep eternal! that Agenor Might find his daughter here, depriv'd of breath, And wipe from her pale brow the dews of death! Ye Powers! this load of life remove, Who gave the boon to be enjoy'd; Behold that boon a burthen prove! Behold your gen'rous aim destroy'd! Change then to death your gift divine; The gift that gladly I resign. [She reclines on the turf in a pensive attitude. SCENE VII. LYCIDAS, SAPPHO, DORIS. Lyc. Heard ye that pensive strain? it was the voice Of Doris. See, reclin'd upon yon bed Of fragrant violets she sits and weeps! Hasten, I pray thee, and with some soft air Chase from her breast the cloud of black despair. [Lycidas retires behind the Bower, while Sappho sits down at her feet, plays a pastoral symphony on her reed, and then sings. Sap. The youth that gazes on thy charms, Rivals in bliss the gods on high, Whose ear thy pleasing converse warms, Thy lovely smile his eye. But trembling awe my bosom heaves, When plac'd those heav'nly charms among; The sight my voice of power bereaves, And chains my torpid tongue. Thro' ev'ry thrilling fibre flies The subtle flame; in dimness drear My eyes are veil'd; a murm'ring noise Glides tinkling thro' my ear; Death's chilly dew my limbs o'erspreads, Shiv'ring, convuls'd, I panting lye; And pale, as is the flower that fades, I droop, I faint, I die! This is meant to be a close translation of the Fragment in Longinus. Dor. Who art thou, bright-ey'd Spirit? for those strains Bespeak thee more than human. Tell me, which Of the tun'd spheres thou guid'st, and why hast left The chiming orb to sooth my mortal ear With thy celestial warblings? SCENE VIII. PHAON. What do I see? a rival at her feet! He clasps her hand, devours it with his kisses. Rouse thee, rash Swain, and stand prepar'd to meet An injur'd lover's fury. [Lycidas rushes from behind the Bower. Lyc. Stand there first, And meet the fury of that injur'd lover Who first has right of vengeance! Pha. Him I've caught In am'rous dalliance; he shall first be punish'd, Thee I can scorn at leisure. [He runs at Sappho, strikes her on the breast, she falls. Dor. Stay thee, Phaon. Ah me! the shepherd swoons. Good Lycidas Prevent a deadlier blow. [Lycidas seizes the crook of Sappho, and stands before the Bower to guard it, while Doris kneels and supports her. Lyc. Base Murderer, pause! In me behold a man, whose firmer arm Is brac'd to meet thy prowess, vile Assassin, I dare thee to the combat! Pha. No, poor Shepherd, Thy heart enough is wounded! Hie thee hence: My wrath shall not assist the scorn of Doris, Curst with the pang of unsuccessful love. Go bear away thy woes and quit the grove. Where the willows skirt the brook, Go and weave a garland green, Leave thou there thy scrip and crook, Vent in tears thy jealous spleen: Heave thou there thy last sad sigh, Drop into the stream and die. Sap. Die didst thou say? I hop'd I had been dead; But death, like Phaon, has deceiv'd poor Sappho. Dor. and Lyc. Sappho! Pha. Just Heav'ns! it is, it is my Sappho, And I have wounded her perhaps to death! Sap. Would to that Heav'n thou hadst! but thou may'st still Atchieve the deed; behold this bruised breast! O! with thy dagger give a kinder blow, And I shall be at peace. Pha. O torture! torture! Where shall I turn? how hide me from myself? SCENE IX. AGENOR. Whence springs this tumult? need I ask the cause, When that licentious wretch appears before me? But who the wounded swain? Dor. Hear, Sire, and wonder, 'Tis Lesbian Sappho; she whose tuneful fame— Sap. Ah! spare the praise, or turn that praise to pity. Yes; pity her, whom fate ordain'd to prove The sharpest pangs of agonizing love. O! if thy aged heart can feel, Ev'n from that venerable eye My woes might bid the tears to steal, And not debase its dignity. [To Agenor. Ag. See, at thy call they freely flow! Ag. Dor. Lyc. We all partake in Sappho's woe! Pha. Shall I, that sorrow's impious cause, Not add my true repentant tear? Ag. Sap. Do. Lyc. Traytor, avaunt! the vengeance fear, That on thy head thy falsehood draws! Ag. Fly from his presence, hapless Fair: Fly to my hospitable gate: Dor. There let this breast thy friendship share; Lyc. There let my zeal on both await. Pha. Shall I be banish'd from the grove, Deny'd my folly to atone? Ag. Sap. Ph. Dor. Lyc. Such is the righteous doom of Jove! So Justice thunders from his throne! [Exeunt—Phaon on the opposite side. END OF THE SECOND ACT. ACT III. SCENE I. A gloomy valley with caves and trees on one side; a fountain issuing from a rock and forming a stream on the other: the sea seen at the termination of the vale, and the moon setting in the horizon. Sappho in her female habit comes out of one of the caves unattended. SAPPHO. The radiant Queen of night retires, And quits her silver car; The Pleiads veil their lambent fires, And ev'ry glittering star, That flam'd on midnight's sable brow, Have ceas'd to tremble, and to glow; While, lost to Phaon, love, and joy, I heave the solitary sigh: Still pants my wakeful heart, still weeps my wearied eye. [She reclines on a bank. Ah! come ye balmy powers of sleep, Nor from my arms, like Phaon, rove. O! bid my eyes forget to weep! Bid my fond heart forget to love. This accompanied Recitative and Air is a kind of paraphrase of a little fragment of Sappho's, apud Hephestionem: ?????? ??? ? ??????, ??? ????????, ????? ?? ??????, ???? ?? ?????? ???? ??? ?? ???? ???????. See the Edition of Pindar and other Lyric Poems by H. Stephens. SCENE II. A soft symphony, during which Sappho falls asleep and the Naiad Arethusa rises from the stream, seated in a shell. ARETHUSA. See! from her translucent bed Arethusa brings thee aid. Lo! she sprinkles on thy breast Vial'd drops, by fingers chaste Cull'd from the cærulean deeps, Where her coldest chrystal sleeps; Where Alphéus dare not lave, To mix with her's his amorous wave. Thrice I lift my virgin hand, Thrice I shed the vapors bland, To calm thy soul; while I declare The council I from Phœbus bear. Know, by my voice, he bids his vot'ry fly To where Leucate's cliff o'erhangs the main. There shall she try The last, the dangerous remedy Of those, who love like her, and love in vain. A voice divine proclaims thy cure: Hear, Sappho, hear that voice divine! To Phœbus haste with off'rings pure, And lay them on his holy shrine: Then from Leucate's frowning brow (Resolved to perish or be free) Rush to the wave that rolls below And welcome Death or Liberty. [Arethusa descends. SCENE III. SAPPHO (awaking.) What do I hear? I'll try the desperate leap. Naiad, I thank thee. In thy friendly fount I drop these tears of pious gratitude. Yes, 'tis resolv'd; ev'n now I mount the rock. Bold Fancy bears me to it's lofty summit; Now hurls me headlong. Countless fathoms deep I fall! the clear blue wave receives me. O how cold; Yet grateful. Quickly will it quench the flame, That thus consumes my heart. Phœbus, I come— Ah! who arrests my step? SCENE IV. PHAON, SAPPHO. Sap. Traitor to love; To honour; to the gods! abjur'd of Heav'n, Avoid my presence! Pha. If repentant tears, And sighs that rend the heart, from whence they spring, Can plead forgiveness, Sappho, hear them plead. Sap. Yes; so he look'd. The sable-fringed lids Of his false eyes thus veil'd their liquid lustre, With modest shamefac'dness, when first he woo'd me. Look thus on Doris, base one! Sappho towers Above thy wiles. The god, the god inspires me! He calls me to Leucate. Dread Apollo, I hear, and I obey thy awful call. Pha. Hah! to Leucate! Sap. Yes, to that fam'd cliff, Whence, dashing down into the whelming surge, I'll die—or live to hate thee. Pha. My heart's Idol, Forego this frenzy! Sap. Say that it were frenzy; The wrongs, that thou hast heap'd on this poor brain, Would justify the deed: but 'tis not frenzy; 'Tis inspiration. From yon stream it rose, In a cærulean robe of Heav'n's own tincture. Naiad! I saw thee rise; I heard thee speak: Thou bad'st me fly to Liberty, or Death. Pha. Fly rather to these arms, to life, to love! Sap. Cruel! It was thy arm, that gave the blow, Which makes life loathsome. Pha. 'Twas the blow of error. Sap. Away! I will not parley with thy falsehood. Pha. Behold me kneel! Sap. Repentance comes too late. Rise, Traitor, rise! my choice is fixt as fate. Pha. O! let this tender tear, Contrition's purest dew, My Sappho's pity move. Sap. No! my intense despair Here sighs a long adieu To Phaon, and to Love I go— Pha. Yet hear— Sap. I go To steep Leucate's brow. I fly from fraud and thee. Pha. Yet stay— Sap. Deceiver! no. The rolling waves below Involve my destiny. Pha. Let Love his softest strains employ To call thee back to him and joy. Sap. In vain; we part to meet no more— Pha. and Sap. What agony severe! Fate has no sharper pang in store The love-lorn breast to tear. [Exeunt severally. SCENE V. Changes to the Temple of Hymen with the Priests of the god standing before the Altar. AGENOR, DORIS, LYCIDAS. Ag. Doris, tho' now the nuptial altar flames, My blessing pauses. Dor. Why, my gracious Father, When my repentant soul with truth returns To filial duty, and to faithful love? Ag. Does Lycidas forgive thee? Lyc. Trust me, Sire, Like summer storms, her frowns, my fears are past, And mutual love shines brighter from the blast. When hail descends in pearly shower, The linnet nestling in the shade, Hides with its wing its drooping head, Nor tunes the sprightly lay. But soon the sun's enlivening power Dispels the cold, that chill'd the plain; And soon the linnet hastes again To warble on it's spray. Dor. Dear Lycidas! that jocund strain bespeaks A heart completely cur'd of jealous fear; Nor shall that baneful guest, Wak'd by my falsehood, more invade thy breast. When beauty, void of faith and truth, Beguil'd my wand'ring eye, This pensive heart, Ah! gentle Youth, Could only heave and sigh. It did not love, it but admir'd; For love's allied to smiles and joy: But now, by thy fair virtue fir'd, It glows with extasy. Ag. Enough! enough! now did the voice of fate Call old Agenor to the darkling tomb, Where sleep his ancestors, trust me, my children, The summons were right welcome. But he lives To bless you both, and take from you the blessing, Which dear observance of your mutual love, Now sheds in streams of joy on his grey hair. Haste, Holy Men, the sacrifice prepare. Pour libations on the shrine; Wake the pipe, the lute, the lyre; Let the loudly-warbling choir In harmonious chorus join. Doris. Lycidas. Call the god, that gives desire Lawful right his joys to share. Agenor. Bid him warm this willing pair With his torch of purest fire. Chorus. Holy Hymen, thou alone Giv'st to faith and constancy Fair fruition's lasting crown, Years of unpolluted joy. SCENE VI. PHAON enters to them. Ag. Ah, whence that step! what wretch disturbs our rites? Lyc. Gods! does the Lesbian traitor dare insult Chaste Hymen with his presence? Ag. Hence! far hence, Thou most profane of that inconstant tribe, Whom Hymen holds accurst. Dor. Hence, on thy life, And dread the god's just vengeance. Pha. Well I know, I merit all his vengeance; death befits The wretch, who murder'd Sappho. Dor. Sappho murder'd? Lyc. And by thy impious hand? Pha. My hand is guiltless; Nor is she dead. But know, she flies to Death, And finds him at Leucate. Ag. Dread resolve! Lyc. Learn, Doris, learn to what dire deeds despair Can drive a slighted lover. Ag. Was this act Her own, or did some Deity inspire it? Pha. She talk'd of visions from Apollo sent, Of some strange Naiad, who proclaim'd his mandate; Yet sure 'twas frenzy all, and caus'd by me: I therefore murder'd Sappho. Lyc. Sure thou didst. Think, what a victim to thy falsehood falls! Ag. She was the very soul of Poesy; Form'd by Apollo's self: her tuneful frame Was the rich lyre, whence all his rapture flow'd. Dor. Nor more attun'd to Poesy, than Love: Each note she breath'd was melting, as the voice Of Venus when she wept Adonis dead. Pha. And had I died before her; died while faithful, Her lays had crown'd me with that shepherd's fame. Ag. Go then, disloyal youth, and mourn thy baseness; Away to chearless solitude. Pha. I mean it. Dor. Bear not to other nymphs thy soft deceits, Thy winning gestures, thy delusive smiles. Lyc. Nor hope, as here thou didst, to part two hearts, Which virtue first united. Ag. Learn, that beauty, Were it as bright as gilds Hyperion's cheek, Save when its bloom inshrines a virtuous heart, Is only splendid misery. Pha. This, and more I patiently can bear. Mix with reproof Your sharpest taunts, I'll yet endure them all; For I deserve them all. Yes, to some cave, Which never chearing sun-beam pierc'd, I'll fly: There live forlorn; there unlamented die. Hail, horrors, hail! I come, I come! Ye caves, o'erhung with savage thorn, Receive me to your haunts forlorn, A sad, a silent guest; Fling round my head your darkest gloom, And hide me in that living tomb, Where anguish exiles rest. [Exit Phaon. Ag. Behold his fate, and tremble, ye that dare To break those chaste and sanctimonious vows, This deity approves. But see, what light Sudden and dazzling sparkles from his symbol! Behold! it moves; it shakes its saffron robe; In gentle guise it waves its lambent torch; It speaks. [The Statue of Hymen during this speech appears animated by degrees, and then utters the following words in accompanying Recitative. Mortals! to you 'tis given to view, In bright ideal portraiture, the scene Now passing at Leucate; mark it well, And stamp the awful moral on your souls. SCENE VII. The Priests of Hymen hasten from the Altar and join the other personages on the front of the Stage; the Temple, Statue, &amp;c. vanish instantly under a change of scene, which represents the Promontory of Leucate. The portico of a magnificent Temple dedicated to Apollo is seen in perspective on one side; out of which the Priests of the god come in solemn procession, followed by Sappho and her attendants: a slow pathetic march is played during the time. Two Orchestras are supposed to be necessary in the final Chorus, and one behind the scene at first. SAPPHO. Here pause awhile! be mute, Ye warblers, that inspire the Dorian flute, While Sappho, once the fav'rite of the Nine, Nay, if fame bids her not too high aspire, Their tuneful sister, to the radiant shrine Of this her patron god, perchance her sire, Devotes this instrument divine. [She hangs her Lyre on one of the Pillars. Lo! on this column's Parian height I hang the glittering freight: And hear, ye Priests, with reverence hear This verse inscriptive, by my voice decreed Memorial of my dying deed. “To Him, that did inspire, “Sappho to Phœbus consecrates her lyre. “What suits with Sappho, Phœbus, suits with thee; “The gift, the giver, and the god agree.” This inscription is borrowed from Mr. Pope's Translation of Ovid's Epistle on the subject. His version was too perfect to admit any attempt at another. This off'ring made, my faithful virgin train, Take ye my last adieu, and from my fate Learn to distrust false man, if not to hate. [She ascends the Rock. Tremendous Rock! I mount thee now; And now I reach thy dreadful brow. O giddy brain support the sight! See, how the surge, as black as night, Rolls horribly below! It rolls—sad solace to despair, Its awful murmurs strike my ear. I faint—I tremble—Powers on high, Ah! hasten from your sky: Catch from perdition this devoted head. Does Zephyr sleep? will Cupid bring No soft, no tutelary wing To waft me to my wat'ry bed? Hear, god of Love, 'tis Sappho calls! Dread deity! 'tis Sappho falls. [She throws herself from the rock; a clap of thunder is heard, and a swan is seen rising from the sea, and ascending to the clouds. Concluding Chorus with both Orchestras. PRIESTS OF APOLLO, HYMEN, AGENOR, &amp;c. Great Jove himself arrests her fate! Hail, prodigy divine! She soars a swan in plumy state; To Jove she soars, to claim In heav'n a residence divine, On earth immortal fame. END OF THE OPERA. PIGMALION, Now first published. A LYRICAL SCENE, TRANSLATED INTO THEATRICAL VERSE FROM THE FRENCH PROSE OF J. J. ROUSSEAU OF GENEVA. The Theatre represents a Statuary's working-room. On one side appear blocks of marble, and unfinished groups and statues. In the centre of the scene, another statue concealed under a pavilion of light transparent silk, ornamented with festoons and fringe. Pigmalion is discovered leaning on his elbow, in a pensive, contemplative, yet unsettled posture. Soon after he rises hastily, takes his tools from the table, and begins to give, at certain intervals, a few strokes of the chissel on one of his unfinished statues. Then steps backward to review his work, with a look of discontent and disappointment. PIGMALION. It will not be. No gleam of life, or soul, Dawns at my stroke. 'Tis still a breathless stone. Away with art like this! it is not art, 'Tis mere abortive labour. Ah my Genius! Where art thou fled? My fancy where retir'd? And why, Imagination! dost thou feel This frost of dullness chilling all thy fires? The marble feels thee not, it quits my hand Cold as it left its quarry. Where, Pigmalion, Where is thy power which once could rival Jove's, Creating gods. 'Tis gone: the veriest wretch That toils for vulgar gain is now thy equal. Hence, ye vile instruments! my glory once, But now my shame, dishonour not my hands. [He throws away his tools with disdain, and walks about meditating with his arms folded over his breast. Whence comes this change, this new unheard of change, This atrophy of soul.—Imperial Tyre! Thou richest, proudest theatre of taste, In vain display'st thou to my sickly sense, The grace that sparkles on thy sculptur'd walls; I cannot taste thy glories, Queen of Asia! Thy artists, thy philosophers, thy painters, Thy bards, the heralds of posterity, Who antedate the praises she shall pay To each true heir of fame, they touch not me; Ev'n friendship's self has lost its power to charm. Ev'n you, ye young, ye lovely; ye sweet proofs Of all that Nature, in her happiest hour, Could e'er attain of perfect, and of fair; Ev'n you, ye blooming models of my art, Who crown'd my toil with rapture, who inspir'd My soul at once with genius, and with love, Yes, since that art has far surpast your charms, Ev'n you are grown indifferent to my sight. [He sits down and contemplates the objects around him. Wretch that I am! chain'd, as by magic spell, To this peculiar spot, listless I sit, Unable or to work, or to retire. Wand'ring from group to group, from form to form, My feeble chissel seems to scorn the power Of its fallacious guide, and each rude feature, (Rude as when first design'd) heeds not the hand Which once could bid it breathe— [Rising with impetuosity. 'Tis done, 'tis past; My genius is expir'd; young as I am, I have outliv'd my art.—But is it thus? Why then these inward ardours that consume me? And why this secret something in my breast That wraps me from myself? Are these the signs, The languid signs, of an exhausted fancy? Feel we, in that dull state, these warm emotions? This flush of passions? this impetuous burst Of fierce desires? this strange inquietude That agitates, torments, distracts the soul? What is the cause? alas! I vainly thought The miracle of grace I lately form'd Made my fond eye a truant to my art, And therefore did I veil it from my sight. Yes, though 'twas profanation, these rash hands Have dar'd to hide the trophy of their fame. 'Tis hid, and what's my gain? more pensiveness, Not more attention. O immortal work! Well may'st thou be thus dear, thus precious to me; For when my genius fails, when age and ills Take from me all the plastic powers I boast, When now no more of beauteous and sublime Lives in my labours; then, my Galatea! Then will I show thee to a wond'ring world, And tell that world Pigmalion made thee thus. Yes, when I've lost my all, thou shalt remain, And I shall be consol'd. [He comes nearer the pavilion, then retires, approaches again, retreats, and stops at intervals to gaze upon it, sighing. But why conceal her? Inactive, dull, desponding as I sit, Why rob myself of that peculiar bliss The sight of her inspires? she is my art's Dear masterpiece; and yet, perhaps, remains Some slight defect that has escap'd my eye, Perhaps I still may to her vestment add Some fold more graceful; 'twere a crime to spare One possible addition that might deck A form so lovely. Haply too the sight Will call to life again the slumb'ring powers Of my invention; better lift the veil, Better review my work—review my work! Alas! till now I only have admir'd it. [He attempts to undraw the Curtain, and lets it fall again as affrighted. Unspeakable emotion! how the touch Of this slight veil affects me. How I tremble! Surely my rash and sacrilegious hand Invades the shrine of some divinity. Fool! 'tis a stone, and thou its sculptor. True— But what of that? are not our temples crowded By gods that claim the worship of the people On no superior charter? [He undraws the Curtain trembling, prostrates himself before the statue of Galatea, which appears placed on a very small pedestal, and that raised on a flight of marble steps, ranged semicircularly. Take, Galatea! take thy maker's homage; I was deceiv'd, I carv'd thee for a nymph, But O thou art a goddess. Venus self Is less divinely fair.—What vanity, What childish weakness this! 'tis my own work, Yet madly I admire it. Vile self-love, These are thy goodly triumphs. Mock'd by thee, I worship in the image I have made My worthless self. Yet surely truth must own Nothing, no nothing e'er appear'd in nature Ev'n half so lovely; I have here surpast The workmanship of Heav'n—and could it be, Could these same hands form such transcendant beauty? These hands that touch'd—this mouth that—Hold, Pigmalion, I spy a fault. This drapery spreads too far, It hides too much, let me relieve the fold, The charms that it conceals should be display'd. [He takes his mallet and chissel and advancing slowly mounts with hesitation the steps before the statue, as if he seemed hardly to dare touch it, at last raising his chissel and preparing to strike, he stops, and cries out— Heav'ns! what a tremulous convulsion shakes me; My quivering nerves attempt in vain to guide Th' uncertain tool. I cannot, dare not strike, I shall do harm, incorrigible harm. [He summons resolution, and raising his chissel gives a stroke, then seized with fear lets it fall. Gods! if the heaving, the elastic flesh Does not resist my chissel! [He descends the steps trembling and confused. Idle fear! Absurdest terror!—No! I will not touch her, The gods inspire this panic; she is theirs, Already theirs, an inmate of their heaven. [He re-examines the figure. What would'st thou change, Pigmalion, what correct, What novel charm supply? She is already Perfection's self; perfection is her fault, Her only fault. Yes, heav'nly Galatea! Wert thou less perfect, nothing would'st thou want— [Tenderly. But yet thou want'st a soul; all, all save that, Thou hast in rich profusion. [With still greater tenderness. Yet, if Heaven Inspir'd that body with a kindred soul, How very lovely ought that soul to be. [He pauses for some time, then returning to his seat, he proceeds in a slow and different tone. What are the wild desires I dare to form? Whither does passion drive me? righteous Heav'n! Th' illusive veil that hid me from myself Falls off. Yet let me not behold my heart, I fear me it contains what, once beheld, Would make me hate it. [A long pause in deep disorder. 'Twill not be conceal'd. Tell then thyself, tell to a mocking world The passion that distracts Pigmalion's soul Has there its lifeless object. Own the cause, The worthy cause that keeps thee idle here; That block, that marble mass, hard, and unform'd, Till with this iron—Idiot that thou art, Sink, sink into thyself, groan o'er thy error, Behold at once thy folly, and bewail it. [Starting up with impetuosity. But 'tis not folly, I abjure the word, My senses still remain; there is no cause For self-reproach. This cold, this breathless marble Is not the thing I love. No, 'tis a being That lives, that thinks, can love, and be belov'd, Alike to this in feature, not in frame; 'Tis her that I adore; and wheresoe'er I find the charming fair one, wheresoe'er She dwells, whate'er her birth, or habitation, She still shall be the idol of my heart. My folly then (if folly be its name) Springs from a quick perceptive sense of beauty, My crime (if I indeed am culpable) proceeds From too much sensibility of soul; —Such crimes, such follies ne'er shall make me blush. [Less fervently, yet still with emotion. Heav'ns! round that form what lambent radiance flings Its darts of fire, they reach, they pierce my soul, And seem to bear me back into their source— Meanwhile, alas! all cold and motionless She stands.—While I, while my tumultuous spirits, Bursting their bounds, would quit their vital seat To warm her breathless bosom. Extacy Gives the transferring power of life and soul, And I will use it; thou shalt die, Pigmalion, (Delicious death!) to live in Galatea. What have I said? Just Heav'ns! to live in her, Then must I cease to view, must cease to love her, No, Fate forbid! Let Galatea live, Yet let my love live too; for to be hers I still must be myself; and, being that, I must be ever hers; must ever love her, And ever be belov'd. [In a tone of transport. Belov'd, distraction! It cannot be, O torment, rage, despair, O hopeless, horrible, distracting passion! The pains of hell rack my desponding soul. Beings of power! Beings of mercy hear me! Hear me, ye gods! before whose awful shrines The people kneel because ye know their frailty; Yes, ye have oft for vainer purposes Lavish'd your miracles; look then with pity On this fair form, look on this tortur'd breast, Be just to both, and merit our oblations. [With a more pathetic degree of enthusiasm. And thou, sublimest Essence! hear the prayer; Who, hid from outward sense, on the mind's eye Pour'st thy refulgent evidence. O hear me Parent of Worlds! Soul of the Universe! Thou, at whose voice, the plastic power of Love Gives to the elements their harmony, To matter life, to body sentiment, To all the tribes of being, place, and form. Hear me, thou sacred, pure, cœlestial fire! Thou all-producing, all-preserving power, Venus Urania hear me! where is now Thy all-adjusting poize, thy force expansive, Where is dread Nature's universal law In my sensations? What a void is here! Ah tell me why thy vivifying warmth Fills not that void, and bids my wishes live? Thy fires are all concenter'd in this breast, While, on yon form, the icy hand of Death Keeps its chill hold. Pigmalion perishes By that excess of life yon marble wants. Goddess, I do not ask a miracle, See, she exists, she ought to be annull'd, Fair Order is disturb'd, all Nature outrag'd; O vindicate her rights; resume again Thy course beneficent, and shed thy blessings In just equality. Yes, Venus, yes, Two beings here are wanting to complete The plenitude of things; divide to each Its share of that fierce fire which scorches one, And leaves the other lifeless. Well thou know'st 'Twas thou that form'd by my deputed hand Those charms, those features; all they want is life And soul—my goddess, give her half of mine, Give her the whole, and let me live in her, Such life will well suffice. O as thou lovest Our mortal homage hear me! they alone, Whom life gives consciousness of Heav'n, and thee, Can pay thee that due homage; let thy works Extend thy glory. Queen of Beauty, hear me! Nor let this model of perfection stand An image vain of unexisting grace. [He returns to himself by degrees with an expression of assurance and joy. Reason returns. What unexpected calm, What fortitude unhop'd for arms my breast! The balm of peace and confidence has cool'd My boiling blood. I feel as born anew. Thus is it still with heav'n-dependent man, The very trust and feel of that dependence Consoles his grief. How heavily soe'er Misfortune flings her load upon his shoulder, Let him but pray to Heav'n, that load is lighten'd. Yet, when to Heav'n we lift a foolish prayer, Our confidence is vain, and we deceiv'd. Alas! alas! in such a state as mine We pray to all, and nothing hears our prayer; The very hope that chears us is more vain Than the desire that rais'd it. O shame, shame On such extravagance. I dare no longer Reflect upon its cause, and yet, whene'er I cast my eye upon yon fatal object, Fresh palpitations, new disquiets choak me, A secret fear restrains— [In a tone of cruel irony. Poor wretch! be bold, Take confidence. Yes, court, and win a statue. [He perceives it to begin to be animated, and starts back seiz'd with affright and with a heart filled with sorrow. What do I see? what did I think I saw? Ye gods, her cheek has bloom, her eye has fire! Nay, but she moves. O, was it not enough To hope a prodigy; to crown my wretchedness Lo, I have seen it. [In excess of desperation. Hapless wretch! 'tis done; Thy madness is confirm'd; reason has left thee As well as genius. Let its loss console thee; It covers thy disgrace. [With a lively indignation. 'Tis as it should be, Happy indeed for him that lov'd a stone To turn a moon-struck madman. [He turns and sees the statue move, and descend the steps on which she had been placed on the foot of the pedestal. He throws himself on his knees, and lifts his hands and eyes to heaven. Holy Heav'n! Immortal gods! O Venus! Galatea O fascination of outrageous Love! GALATEA [She touches herself and says] Myself! PIGMALION. [transported.] Myself! GALATEA. [touching herself again.] It is myself. PIGMALION. O blest, O exquisite delusion! it affects My very ears. Ah, never more abandon My raptur'd senses. GALATEA. [stepping aside and touching one of the marbles.] This is not myself. [Pigmalion in an agitation and transport unable almost to contain himself, follows all her motions, listens, observes her with an eager attention which almost takes away his breath. [Galatea comes to him again, and gazes on him, he opens his arms and beholds her with extacy. She rests her hand upon him, he trembles, seizes her hand, puts it to his heart, and then devours it with kisses. Ah! 'tis myself again! [With a sigh. PIGMALION. Yes, loveliest, best, And worthiest masterpiece of these blest hands, Dear offspring of my heart, and of the gods, It is thyself; it is thyself alone; I gave thee all my being, and will live, My Galatea, only to be thine. [The curtain falls. END OF VOL. II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. THE ART OF PAINTING, OF CHARLES ALPHONSE DU FRESNOY; TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH VERSE BY WILLIAM MASON, M. A. WITH ANNOTATIONS BY SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. EPISTLE TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. When Dryden, worn with sickness, bow'd with years, Was doom'd (my Friend, let pity warm thy tears,) The galling pang of penury to feel, For ill-placed loyalty, and courtly zeal, To see that laurel which his brows o'erspread, Transplanted droop on Shadwell's barren head, The Bard oppress'd, yet not subdued by fate, For very bread descended to translate: And he, whose fancy, copious as his phrase, Could light at will expression's brightest blaze, On Fresnoy's lay employ'd his studious hour; But niggard there of that melodious power, His pen in haste the hireling task to close Transform'd the studied strain to careless prose, Which, fondly lending faith to French pretence, Mistook its meaning, or obscur'd its sense. Yet still he pleas'd; for Dryden still must please, Whether with artless elegance and ease He glides in prose, or from its tinkling chime, By varied pauses, purifies his rhyme, And mounts on Maro's plumes, and soars his heights sublime. This artless elegance, this native fire Provok'd his tuneful heir Mr. Pope, in his Epistle to Jervas, has these lines: Read these instructive leaves, in which conspire Fresnoy's close art with Dryden's native fire. to strike the lyre, Who, proud his numbers with that prose to join, Wove an illustrious wreath for Friendship's shrine. How oft, on that fair shrine when Poets bind The flowers of song, does partial passion blind Their judgment's eye! How oft does truth disclaim The deed, and scorn to call it genuine fame! How did she here, when Jervas was the theme, Waft thro' the ivory gate the Poet's dream! How view, indignant, error's base alloy The sterling lustre of his praise destroy. Which now, if praise like his my Muse could coin, Current through ages, she would stamp for thine! Let Friendship, as she caus'd, excuse the deed; With thee, and such as thee, she must succeed. But what, if Fashion tempted Pope astray? The witch has spells, and Jervas knew a day When mode-struck belles and beaux were proud to come, And buy of him a thousand years of bloom. Alluding to another couplet in the same Epistle Beauty, frail flower, that every season fears, Blooms in thy colours for a thousand years. Ev'n then I deem it but a venal crime: Perish alone that selfish sordid rhyme, Which flatters lawless sway, or tinsel pride: Let black Oblivion plunge it in her tide. From fate like this my truth-supported lays, Ev'n if aspiring to thy pencil's praise, Would flow secure: but humbler aims are mine; Know, when to thee I consecrate the line, 'Tis but to thank thy genius for the ray Which pours on Fresnoy's rules a fuller day: Those candid strictures, those reflections new, Refin'd by taste, yet still as nature true, Which, blended here with his instructive strains, Shall bid thy art inherit new domains; Give her in Albion as in Greece to rule, And guide (what thou hast form'd) a British School. And, O, if aught thy Poet can pretend Beyond his favourite wish to call thee Friend, Be it that here his tuneful toil has drest The Muse of Fresnoy in a modern vest; And with that skill his fancy could bestow, Taught the close folds to take an easier flow; Be it, that here thy partial smile approv'd The pains he lavish'd on the art he lov'd. W. MASON. October 10, 1782. THE ART OF PAINTING, WITH THE ORIGINAL TEXT SUBJOINED. True poetry the Painter's power displays: True Painting emulates the Poet's lays; The rival sisters, fond of equal fame, Alternate change their office and their name; Bid silent Poetry the canvass warm, The tuneful page with speaking picture charm. What to the ear sublimer rapture brings, That strain alone the genuine Poet sings; That form alone where glows peculiar grace, The genuine Painter condescends to trace: No sordid theme will verse or paint admit, Unworthy colours, if unworthy wit. From you, blest Pair! Religion deigns to claim Her sacred honours; at her awful name High o'er the stars you take your soaring flight, And rove the regions of supernal light; Attend to lays that flow, from tongues divine, Undazzled gaze where charms seraphic shine; Trace beauty's beam to its eternal spring, And pure to man the fire celestial bring. Then round this globe on joint pursuit ye stray, Time's ample annals studiously survey; And from the eddies of Oblivion's stream Propitious snatch each memorable theme. Thus to each form, in heaven, and earth, and sea, That wins with grace, or awes with dignity, To each exalted deed, which dares to claim The glorious meed of an immortal fame, That meed ye grant. Hence, to remotest age, The hero's soul darts from the Poet's page, Hence, from the canvass still, with wonted state, He lives, he breathes, he braves the frown of Fate, Such powers, such praises, heaven-born Pair, belong To magic colouring, and creative song. But here I pause, nor ask Pieria's train, Nor Phœbus self to elevate the strain: Vain is the flow'ry verse, when reasoning sage And sober precept fill the studied page; Enough if there the fluent numbers please, With native clearness, and instructive ease. Nor shall my rules the artist's hand confine, Whom practice gives to strike the free design; Or banish Fancy from her fairy plains, Or fetter Genius in didactic chains: No, 'tis their liberal purpose to convey That scientific skill which wins its way On docile Nature, and transmits to youth, Talents to reach, and taste to relish truth; While inborn genius from their aid receives Each supplemental art that practice gives. I. Of the Beautiful.'Tis Painting's first chief business to explore, What lovelier forms in Nature's boundless store Are best to art and ancient taste allied, For ancient taste those forms has best applied. Till this be learn'd, how all things disagree! How all one wretched, blind barbarity! The fool to native ignorance confin'd, No beauty beaming on his clouded mind; Untaught to relish, yet too proud to learn, He scorns the grace his dulness can't discern. Hence reason to caprice resigns the stage, And hence that maxim of the ancient Sage, “Of all vain fools with coxcomb talents curst, “Bad Painters and bad Poets are the worst.” When first the orient rays of beauty move The conscious soul, they light the lamp of love; Love wakes those warm desires that prompt our chace, To follow and to fix each flying grace; But earth-born graces sparingly impart The symmetry supreme of perfect art: For tho' our casual glance may sometimes meet With charms that strike the soul, and seem complete, Yet if those charms too closely we define, Content to copy Nature line for line, Our end is lost. Not such the Master's care, Curious he culls the perfect from the fair; Judge of his art, thro' beauty's realm he flies, Selects, combines, improves, diversifies; With nimble step pursues the fleeting throng, And clasps each Venus as she glides along. II. Of Theory and Practice.Yet some there are who indiscreetly stray, Where purblind Practice only points the way; Who every theoretic truth disdain, And blunder on mechanically vain. Some too there are, within whose languid breasts A lifeless heap of embryo knowledge rests When nor the pencil feels their drowsy art, Nor the skill'd hand explains the meaning heart. In chains of sloth such talents droop confin'd: 'Twas not by words Apelles charm'd mankind. Hear then the Muse; though perfect beauty towers Above the reach of her descriptive powers, Yet will she strive some leading rules to draw From sovereign Nature's universal law; Stretch her wide view o'er ancient Art's domain, Again establish Reason's legal reign, Genius again correct with science sage, And curb luxuriant Fancy's headlong rage. “Right ever reigns its stated bounds between, “And taste, like morals, loves the golden mean.” III. Of the Subject.Some lofty theme let judgment first supply, Supremely fraught with grace and majesty; For fancy copious, free to every charm That lines can circumscribe or colours warm; Still happier, if that artful theme dispense A poignant moral and instructive sense. Invention the first part of painting.Then let the virgin canvass smooth expand, To claim the sketch and tempt the Artist's hand: Then bold Invention, all the powers diffuse, Of all thy sisters thou the noblest Muse: Thee every art, thee every grace inspires, Thee Phœbus fills with all his brightest fires. IV. Disposition or economy of the whole.Choose such judicious force of shade and light As suits the theme, and satisfies the sight; Weigh part with part, and with prophetic eye The future power of all thy tints descry; And those, those only on the canvass place, Whose hues are social, whose effect is grace. V. The Subject to be treated faithfully.Vivid and faithful to the historic page, Express the customs, manners, forms, and age; VI. Every foreign ornament to be rejected.Nor paint conspicuous on the foremost plain Whate'er is false, impertinent, or vain; But like the Tragic Muse, thy lustre throw, Where the chief action claims its warmest glow. This rare, this arduous task no rules can teach, No skill'd preceptor point, no practice reach; 'Tis taste, 'tis genius, 'tis the heav'nly ray Prometheus ravish'd from the car of day. In Egypt first the infant art appear'd, Rude and unform'd; but when to Greece she steer'd Her prosperous course, fair Fancy met the Maid, Wit, Reason, Judgment, lent their powerful aid; Till all complete the gradual wonder shone, And vanquish'd Nature own'd herself outdone. 'Twas there the goddess fix'd her blest abodes, There reign'd in Corinth, Athens, Sicyon, Rhodes, Her various vot'ries various talents crown'd: Yet each alike her inspiration own'd: Witness those marble miracles of grace, Those tests of symmetry where still we trace All art's perfection: With reluctant gaze To these the genius of succeeding days Looks dazzled up, and, as their glories spread, Hides in his mantle his diminish'd head. VII. Design or Position, the second part of painting.Learn then from Greece, ye Youths, Proportion's law, Inform'd by her, each just Position draw; Skilful to change each large unequal part, With varied motion and contrasted art; Full in the front the nobler limbs to place, And poise each figure on its central base, But chief from her that flowing outline take, Which floats, in wavy windings, like the snake, Or lambent flame; which, ample, broad, and long, Reliev'd not swell'd, at once both light and strong, Glides thro' the graceful whole. Her art divine Cuts not, in parts minute, the tame design, But by a few bold strokes, distinct and free, Calls forth the charms of perfect symmetry. True to anatomy, more true to grace, She bids each muscle know its native place; Bids small from great in just gradation rise, And, at one visual point, approach the eyes. Yet deem not, Youths, that Perspective can give Those charms complete by which your works shall live: What tho' her rules may to your hand impart A quick mechanic substitute for art, Yet formal, geometric shapes she draws; Hence the true Genius scorns her rigid laws; By Nature taught he strikes th' unerring lines, Consults his eye, and as he sees designs. VIII. Variety in the figures.Man's changeful race, the sport of chance and time, Varies no less in aspect than in clime; Mark well the difference, and let each be seen Of various age, complexion, hair, and mien. IX. Conformity of the limbs and drapery to the head.Yet to each separate form adapt with care Such limbs, such robes, such attitude and air, As best befit the head, and best combine To make one whole, one uniform design: X. Action of the mutes to be imitated.Learn action from the dumb; the dumb shall teach How happiest to supply the want of speech. XI. The principal figure.Fair in the front, in all the blaze of light, The hero of thy piece should meet the sight. Supreme in beauty: lavish here thine art, And bid him boldly from the canvass start: XII. Groups of figures.While round that sov'reign form th' inferior train In groups collected fill the pictur'd plain; Fill, but not crowd; for oft some open space Must part their ranks and leave a vacant place, Lest artlessly dispers'd the sever'd crew At random rush on our bewilder'd view; Or parts with parts, in thick confusion bound, Spread a tumultuous chaos o'er the ground. XIII. Diversity of Attitude in Groups.In every figur'd group the judging eye Demands the charms of contrariety: In forms, in attitudes, expects to trace Distinct inflections, and contrasted grace, Where art diversely leads each changeful line, Opposes, breaks, divides the whole design: Thus, when the rest in front their charms display, Let one with face averted turn away; Shoulders oppose to breasts, and left to right, With parts that meet and parts that shun the sight. This rule in practice uniformly true Extends alike to many forms or few, XIV. A balance to be kept in the picture.Yet keep thro' all the piece a perfect poize: If here in frequent troops the figures rise, There let some object tower with equal pride; And so arrange each correspondent side, That, thro' the well-connected plan, appear No cold vacuity, no desert drear. XV. Of the number of figures.Say, does the Poet glow with genuine rage, Who crouds with pomp and noise his bustling stage? Devoid alike of taste that Painter deem, Whose flutt'ring works with num'rous figures teem; A task so various how shall art fulfill, When oft the simplest forms elude our skill? But, did the toil succeed, we still should lose That solemn majesty, that soft repose, Dear to the curious eye, and only found, Where few fair objects fill an ample ground. Yet if some grand important theme demand Of many needful forms a busy band, Judgment will so the several groups unite, That one compacted whole shall meet the sight. XVI. The joints of the feet.The joints in each extreme distinctly treat, Nor e'er conceal the outline of the feet; XVII. The motion of the hands with the head.The hands alike demand to be exprest In half-shown figures rang'd behind the rest; Nor can such forms with force or beauty shine, Save when the head and hands in action join. XVIII. What things are to be avoided in the Distribution of the Piece.Each air constrain'd and forc'd, each gesture rude, Whate'er contracts or cramps the attitude, With scorn discard. When squares or angles join, When flows in tedious parallel the line, Acute, obtuse, whene'er the shapes appear, Or take a formal geometric air, These all displease, and the disgusted eye Nauseates the tame and irksome symmetry. Mark then our former rule; Page 35, Rule xiii. with contrast strong And mode transverse the leading lines prolong; For these in each design, if well exprest, Give value, force, and lustre to the rest. XIX. Nature to be accommodated to Genius.Nor yet to Nature such strict homage pay, As not to quit when Genius leads the way; Nor yet tho' Genius all his succour sends, Her mimic powers tho' ready Memory lends, Presume from Nature wholly to depart, For nature is the arbitress of art. In Error's grove ten thousand thickets spread, Ten thousand devious paths our steps mislead; Mid curves, that vary in perpetual twine, Truth owns but one direct and perfect line. XX. The Antique the model to be copied.Spread then her genuine charms o'er all the piece, Sublime and perfect as they glow'd in Greece. Those genuine charms to seize, with zeal explore The vases, medals, statues, form'd of yore, Relievos high that swell the column's stem, Speak from the marble, sparkle from the gem; Hence all-majestic on th' expanding soul, In copious tide the bright ideas roll; Fill it with radiant forms unknown before, Forms such as demigods and heroes wore: Here pause and pity our enervate days, Hopeless to rival their transcendent praise. XXI. How to paint a single figure.Peculiar toil on single forms bestow, There let expression lend its finish'd glow; There each variety of tint unite With the full harmony of shade and light. XXII. Of Drapery.Free o'er the limbs the flowing vesture cast, The light broad folds with grace majestic placed; And as each figure turns a different way, Give the large plaits their corresponding play; Yet devious oft and swelling from the part, The flowing robe with ease should seem to start; Not on the form in stiff adhesion laid, But well reliev'd by gentle light and shade. Where'er a flat vacuity is seen, There let some shadowy bending intervene, Above, below, to lead its varied line, As best may teach the distant folds to join; And as the limbs by few bold strokes exprest Excel in beauty, so the liberal vest In large, distinct, unwrinkled folds should fly, Beauty's best handmaid is Simplicity. To different ranks adapt their proper robe; With ample pall let monarchs sweep the globe; In garb succinct and coarse array the swain; In light and silken veils the virgin train. Where in black shade the deeper hollow lies, Assisting art some midway fold supplies, That gently meets the light, and gently spreads To break the hardness of opposing shades. XXIII. Of Picturesque Ornament.Each nobler symbol classic sages use, To mark a virtue, or adorn a Muse. Ensigns of war, of peace, or rites divine, These in thy work with dignity may shine: XXIV. Ornament of gold and jewels.But sparingly thy earth-born stores unfold, Nor load with gems, nor lace with tawdry gold; Rare things alone are dear in Custom's eye, They lose their value as they multiply. XXV. Of the Model.Of absent forms the features to define, Prepare a model to direct thy line; XXVI. Union of the piece.Each garb, each custom, with precision trace, Unite in strict decorum time with place; XXVII. Grace and Majesty.And emulous alone of genuine fame, Be Grace, be Majesty thy constant aim, That Majesty, that Grace so rarely given To mortal man, nor taught by art but Heaven. XXVIII. Every thing in its proper place.In all to sage propriety attend, Nor sink the clouds, nor bid the waves ascend; Lift not the mansions drear of Hell or Night Above the Thunderer's lofty arch of light; Nor build the column on an osier base; But let each object know its native place. XXIX. The Passions.Thy last, thy noblest task remains untold, Passion to paint, and sentiment unfold; Yet how these motions of the mind display! Can colours catch them, or can lines pourtray? Who shall our pigmy pencils arm with might To seize the soul, and force her into sight? Jove, Jove alone; his highly-favour'd few Alone can call such miracles to view. But this to rhet'ric and the schools I leave, Content from ancient lore one rule to give: “By tedious toil no passions are exprest, “His hand who feels them strongest paints them best.” XXX. Gothic ornament to be avoided.Yet shall the Muse with all her force proscribe, Of base and barbarous forms that Gothic tribe, Which sprung to birth, what time, thro' lust of sway, Imperial Latium bade the world obey: Fierce from the north the headlong demons flew, The wreaths of science wither'd at their view; Plagues were their harbingers, and war accurst, And luxury, of every fiend the worst: Then did each Muse behold her triumphs fade, Then pensive Painting droop'd the languish'd head; And sorrowing Sculpture, while the ruthless flame Involv'd each trophy of her Sister's fame, Fled to sepulchral cells her own to save, And lurk'd a patient inmate of the grave. Meanwhile beneath the frown of angry Heaven, Unworthy every boon its smile had given, Involv'd in Error's cloud, and scorn'd of light, The guilty empire sunk. Then horrid Night, And Dulness drear their murky vigils kept, In savage gloom the impious Ages slept, Till Genius, starting from his rugged bed, Full late awoke, the ceaseless tear to shed For perish'd Art; for those celestial hues, Which Zeuxis, aided by the Attic Muse, Colouring the third Part of Painting.Gave to the wond'ring eye: she bade his name With thine, Apelles, gild the lists of fame; With thine to colouring's brightest glories soar, The gods applaud him, and the world adore. Alas! how lost those magic mixtures all! No hues of this now animate the wall; How then shall modern art those hues apply, How give design its finish'd dignity? Return, fair Colouring! all thy lures prepare, Each safe deception, every honest snare, Which brings new lovers to thy sister's train, Skilful at once to charm, and to retain; Come, faithful Siren! chaste seducer! say, What laws control thee, and what powers obey. Know first, that light displays and shade destroys Refulgent Nature's variegated dyes. Thus bodies near the light distinctly shine With rays direct, and as it fades decline. Thus to the eye oppos'd with stronger light They meet its orb, for distance dims the sight. XXXI. The conduct of the Tints of Light and Shadow.Learn hence to paint the parts that meet the view In spheric forms, of bright and equal hue; While, from the light receding or the eye, The sinking outlines take a fainter dye. Lost and confus'd progressively they fade, Not fall precipitate from light to shade. This Nature dictates, and this Taste pursues, Studious in gradual gloom her lights to lose; The various whole with soft'ning tints to fill, As if one single head employ'd her skill. Thus, if bold Fancy plan some proud design, Where many various groups divide or join, (Tho' sure from more than three confusion springs,) One globe of light and shade o'er all she flings; Yet skill'd the separate masses to dispose, Where'er, in front, the fuller radiance glows, Behind, a calm reposing gloom she spreads, Relieving shades with light, and light with shades. And as the centre of some convex glass Draws to a point the congregated mass Of dazzling rays, that, more than nature bright, Reflect each image in an orb of light, While from that point the scatter'd beams retire, Sink to the verge, and there in shade expire; So strongly near, so softly distant throw On all thy rounded groups the circling glow. As is the Sculptor's, such the Painter's aim, Their labour different, but their end the same; What from the marble the rude chissel breaks, The softer pencil from the canvass takes: And, skill'd remoter distances to keep, Surrounds the outline pale in shadows deep; While on the front the sparkling lustre plays, And meets the eye in full meridian blaze. True Colouring thus, in plastic power excels, Fair to the visual point her forms she swells, And lifts them from their flat aërial ground Warm as the life, and as the statue round. XXXII. Dense and opaque bodies with translucent ones.In silver clouds, in ether's blue domain, Or the clear mirror of the wat'ry plain, If chance some solid substance claim a place, Firm and opaque amid the lucid space, Rough let it swell and boldly meet the sight, Mark'd with peculiar strength of shade and light; There blend each earthly tint of heaviest sort, At once to give consistence and support, While the bright wave, soft cloud, or azure sky, Light and pellucid from that substance fly. XXXIII. There must not be two equal lights in the picture.Permit not two conspicuous lights to shine With rival radiance in the same design; But yield to one alone the power to blaze, And spread the extensive vigour of its rays, There where the noblest figures are display'd; Thence gild the distant parts, and lessening fade: As fade the beams which Phœbus from the east Flings vivid forth to light the distant west, Gradual those vivid beams forget to shine, So gradual let thy pictur'd lights decline. The sculptor'd forms which some proud Circus grace, In Parian marble or Corinthian brass, Illumin'd thus, give to the gazing eye Th' expressive head in radiant majesty, While to each lower limb the fainter ray Lends only light to mark, but not display: So let thy pencil fling its beams around, Nor e'er with darker shades their force confound. For shades too dark, dissever'd shapes will give, And sink the parts their softness would relieve: Then only well reliev'd, when like a veil Round the full lights the wand'ring shadows steal; Then only justly spread, when to the sight A breadth of shade pursues a breadth of light. This charm to give, great Titian wisely made The cluster'd grapes his rule of light and shade. XXXIV. Of white and black.White, when it shines with unstain'd lustre clear, May bear an object back, or bring it near; Aided by black, it to the front aspires, That aid withdrawn, it distantly retires; But black unmix'd, of darkest midnight hue, Still calls each object nearer to the view. XXXV. The reflection of colours.Whate'er we spy thro' colour'd light or air, A stain congenial on their surface bear, While neighb'ring forms by joint reflection give And mutual take the dyes that they receive. XXXVI. The union of colours.But where on both alike one equal light Diffusive spreads, the blending tints unite. For breaking colours thus (the ancient phrase By Artists used) fair Venice claims our praise: She, cautious to transgress so sage a rule, Confin'd to soberest tints her learned school; For tho' she lov'd by varied mode to join Tumultuous crowds in one immense design, Yet there we ne'er condemn such hostile hues As cut the parts or glaringly confuse; In tinsel trim no foppish form is drest, Still flows in graceful unity the vest; And o'er that vest a kindred mantle spreads, Unvaried but by power of lights and shades, Which mildly mixing every social dye, Unites the whole in loveliest harmony. XXXVII. Of the interposition of air.When small the space, or pure the ambient air, Each form is seen in bright precision clear; But if thick clouds that purity deface, If far extend that intervening space, There all confus'd the objects faintly rise, As if prepar'd to vanish from our eyes. XXXVIII. The relation of distances.Give then each foremost part a touch so bright, That, o'er the rest, its domineering light May much prevail; yet, relative in all, Let greater parts advance before the small. XXXIX. Of bodies which are distanced.Minuter forms, when distantly we trace, Are mingled all in one compacted mass; Such the light leaves that clothe remoter woods, And such the waves on wide-extended floods. XL. Of contiguous and separated bodies.Let each contiguous part be firm allied, Nor labour less the separate to divide; Yet so divide that to th' approving eye They both at small and pleasing distance lie. XLI. Colours very opposite to each other never to be joined.Forbid two hostile colours close to meet, And win with middle tints their union sweet; Yet varying all thy tones, let some aspire XLII. Diversity of Tints and Colours.Fiercely in front, some tenderly retire. XLIII. The Choice of light.Vain is the hope by colouring to display The bright effulgence of the noon-tide ray, Or paint the full-orb'd Ruler of the skies With pencils dipp'd in dull terrestrial dyes: But when mild Evening sheds her golden light; When Morn appears array'd in modest white; When soft suffusion of the vernal shower Dims the pale Sun; or, at the thund'ring hour, When, wrapt in crimson clouds, he hides his head, Then catch the glow, and on the canvass spread. XLIV. Of certain things relating to the practical part.Bodies of polish'd or transparent tone, Of metal, crystal, iv'ry, wood, or stone: And all whose rough unequal parts are rear'd, The shaggy fleece, thick fur, or bristly beard; The liquid too; the sadly melting eye, The well-comb'd locks that wave with glossy dye; Plumage and silks; a floating form that take, Fair Nature's mirrour, the extended lake; With what immers'd thro' its calm medium shines By reflex light, or to its surface joins; These first with thin and even shades portray, Then, on their flatness strike th' enlivening ray, Bright and distinct,—and last, with strict review, Restore to every form its outline true. XLV. The Field of the Picture.By mellowing skill thy ground at distance cast, Free as the air, and transient as its blast; There all thy liquid colours sweetly blend, There all the treasures of thy palette spend, And every form retiring to that ground Of hue congenial to itself compound. XLVI. Of the Vivacity of Colours.The hand that colours well, must colour bright; Hope not that praise to gain by sickly white; XLVII. Of shadows.But amply heap in front each splendid dye, Then thin and light withdraw them from the eye, XLVIII. The picture to be of one piece.Mix'd with that simple unity of shade, As all were from one single palette spread. XLIX. The Looking-glass the Painter's best master.Much will the mirrour teach, or evening grey, When o'er some ample space her twilight ray Obscurely gleams; hence Art shall best perceive On distant parts what fainter hues to give. L. A half Figure or a whole one before others.Whate'er the form which our first glance commands, Whether in front or in profile he stands, Whether he rule the group, or singly reign, Or shine at distance on some ample plain, On that high-finish'd form let Paint bestow Her midnight shadow, her meridian glow. LI. A Portrait.The portrait claims from imitative art Resemblance close in each minuter part, And this to give, the ready hand and eye With playful skill the kindred features ply; From part to part alternately convey The harmonizing gloom, the darting ray, With tones so just, in such gradation thrown, Adopting Nature owns the work her own. LII. The place of the Picture.Say, is the piece thy hand prepares to trace Ordain'd for nearer sight, or narrow space? Paint it of soft and amicable hue: But if predestin'd to remoter view, Thy strong unequal varied colours blend; And ample space to ample figures lend, LIII. Large lights.Where to broad lights the circumambient shade In liquid play by labour just is laid; LIV. The quantity of light and shade to be adapted to the place of the Picture.Alike with liveliest touch the forms portray, Where the dim window half excludes the day; But, when expos'd in fuller light or air, A brown and sober cast the group may bear. LV. Things which are disagreeable in painting to be avoided.Fly every foe to elegance and grace, Each yawning hollow, each divided space; Whate'er is trite, minute, abrupt, or dry, Where light meets shade in flat equality; Each theme fantastic, filthy, vile, or vain, That gives the soul disgust or senses pain; Monsters of barbarous birth, Chimeras drear, That pall with ugliness, or awe with fear. And all that chaos of sharp broken parts, Where reigns confusion, or whence discord starts. LVI. The prudential part of a Painter.Yet hear me, Youths! while zealous ye forsake Detected faults, this friendly caution take,— Shun all excess; and with true wisdom deem, That vice alike resides in each extreme. LVII. The idea of a beautiful Picture.Know, if supreme perfection be your aim, If classic praise your pencil hope to claim, Your noble outlines must be chaste, yet free, Connected all with studied harmony: Few in their parts, yet those distinct and great; Your Colouring boldly strong, yet softly sweet. LVIII. Advice to a young Painter.Know, he that well begins has half achiev'd His destin'd work. Yet late shall be retriev'd That time mis-spent, that labour worse than lost, The young disciple, to his dearest cost, Gives to a dull preceptor's tame designs; His tawdry colours, his erroneous lines, Will to the soul that poison rank convey, Which life's best length shall fail to purge away. Yet let not your untutor'd childhood strive Of Nature's living charms the sketch to give, Till, skill'd her separate features to design, You know each muscle's site, and how they join. These while beneath some master's eye you trace, Vers'd in the lore of symmetry and grace, Boldly proceed: his precepts shall impart Each sweet deception of the pleasing art: Still more than precept shall his practice teach, And add what self-reflection ne'er can reach. LIX. Art must be subservient to the Painter.Oft, when alone, the studious hour employ On what may aid your art, and what destroy; LX. Diversity and facility are pleasing.Diversity of parts is sure to please, If all the various parts unite with ease; As surely charms that voluntary style, Which careless plays, and seems to mock at toil; For labour'd lines with cold exactness tire, 'Tis freedom only gives the force and fire Etherial; she, with alchymy divine, Brightens each touch, ennobles every line; Yet pains and practice only can bestow This facile power of hand, whose liberal flow With grateful fraud its own exertions veils; He best employs his art who best conceals. LXI. The Original must be in the head, and the Copy on the cloth.This to obtain, let taste with judgment join'd The future whole infix upon thy mind; Be there each line in truth ideal drawn, Or ere a colour on the canvass dawn; Then as the work proceeds, that work submit To sight instinctive, not to doubting wit; LXIII. The Compass to be in the eyes.The eye each obvious error swift descries, Hold then the compass only in the eyes. LXIII. Pride an enemy to good painting.Give to the dictates of the learn'd respect, Nor proudly untaught sentiments reject, Severe to self alone: for self is blind, And deems each merit in its offspring join'd: Such fond delusion time can best remove, Concealing for a while the child we love: By absence then the eye impartial grown, Will, tho' no friend assist, each error own; But these subdued, let thy determin'd mind Veer not with every critic's veering wind, Or e'er submit thy genius to the rules Of prating fops, or self-important fools; Enough if from the learn'd applause be won; Who doat on random praises, merit none. LXIV. Know thyself.By Nature's sympathetic power, we see, As is the parent, such the progeny: Ev'n Artists, bound by their instinctive law, In all their works their own resemblance draw: Learn then “to know thyself;” that precept sage Shall best allay luxuriant Fancy's rage; Shall point how far indulgent Genius deigns To aid her flight, and to what point restrains. But as the blushing fruits, the breathing flowers, Adorning Flora's and Pomona's bowers, When forcing fires command their buds to swell, Refuse their dulcet taste, their balmy smell; So Labour's vain extortion ne'er achieves That grace supreme which willing Genius gives. LXV. Perpetually practise, and do easily what you have conceived.Thus tho' to pains and practice much we owe, Tho' thence each line obtains its easy flow, Yet let those pains, that practice, ne'er be join'd, To blunt the native vigour of the mind. LXVI. The morning most proper for work.When shines the morn, when in recruited course The spirits flow, devote their active force To every nicer part of thy design, LXVII. Every day do something.But pass no idle day without a line: LXVIII. The method of catching natural passions.And wand'ring oft the crowded streets along, The native gestures of the passing throng Attentive mark; for many a casual grace, Th' expressive lines of each impassion'd face That bears its joys or sorrows undisguis'd, May by observant Taste be there surpriz'd. Thus, true to art, and zealous to excel, Ponder on Nature's powers, and weigh them well! Explore thro' earth and heaven, thro' sea and skies, The accidental graces as they rise; LXIX. Of the table-book.And while each present form the Fancy warms, Swift on thy tablets fix its fleeting charms. To Temperance all our liveliest powers we owe, She bids the Judgment wake, the Fancy flow; For her the Artist shuns the fuming feast, The midnight roar, the Bacchanalian guest, And seeks those softer opiates of the soul, The social circle, the diluted bowl: Crown'd with the freedom of a single life, He flies domestic din, litigious strife; Abhors the noisy haunts of bustling trade, And steals serene to solitude and shade; There calmly seated in his village bower, He gives to noblest themes the studious hour, While Genius, Practice, Contemplation join To warm his soul with energy divine; For paltry gold let pining misers sigh, His soul invokes a nobler deity; Smit with the glorious avarice of fame, He claims no less than an immortal name; Hence on his fancy just conception shines, True judgment guides his hand, true taste refines; Hence ceaseless toil, devotion to his art, A docile temper, and a generous heart; Docile, his sage preceptor to obey, Generous, his aid with gratitude to pay; Blest with the bloom of youth, the nerves of health, And competence, a better boon than wealth. Great blessings these! yet will not these empower His tints to charm at every labouring hour: All have their brilliant moments, when alone They paint as if some star propitious shone. Yet then, e'en then, the hand but ill conveys The bolder grace that in the fancy plays: Hence, candid critics, this sad truth confest, Accept what least is bad, and deem it best; Lament the soul in error's thraldom held, Compare life's span with art's extensive field; Know that ere perfect taste matures the mind, Or perfect practice to that taste be join'd, Comes age, comes sickness, comes contracting pain, And chills the warmth of youth in every vein. Rise then, ye Youths, while yet that warmth inspires, While yet nor years impair, nor labour tires, While health, while strength are yours, while that mild ray Which shone auspicious on your natal day, Conducts you to Minerva's peaceful quire,— Sons of her choice, and sharers of her fire, Rise at the call of Art: expand your breast, Capacious to receive the mighty guest, While, free from prejudice, your active eye Preserves its first unsullied purity; While new to beauty's charms, your eager soul Drinks copious draughts of the delicious whole, And Memory on her soft, yet lasting page, Stamps the fresh image which shall charm thro' age. LXX. The method of Studies for a young Painter.When duly taught each geometric rule, Approach with awful step the Grecian school, The sculptur'd reliques of her skill survey, Muse on by night, and imitate by day; No rest, no pause, till, all her graces known, A happy habit makes each grace your own. As years advance, to modern masters come, Gaze on their glories in majestic Rome; Admire the proud productions of their skill, Which Venice, Parma, and Bologna fill: And, rightly led by our preceptive lore, Their style, their colouring, part by part, explore: See Raffaelle there his forms celestial trace, Unrivall'd Sovereign of the realms of Grace: See Angelo, with energy divine, Seize on the summit of correct design: Learn how at Julio's birth the Muses smil'd, And in their mystic caverns nurs'd the child; How, by th' Aonian powers their smile bestow'd, His pencil with poetic fervour glow'd; When faintly verse Apollo's charms convey'd, He op'd the shrine, and all the god display'd: His triumphs more than mortal pomp adorns, With more than mortal rage his battle burns; His heroes, happy heirs of fav'ring fame, More from his art than from their actions claim. Bright, beyond all the rest, Correggio flings His ample lights, and round them gently brings The mingling shade. In all his works we view Grandeur of style, and chastity of hue. Yet higher still great Titian dar'd to soar, He reach'd the loftiest heights of colouring's power; His friendly tints in happiest mixture flow, His shades and lights their just gradations know; His were those dear delusions of the art, That round, relieve, inspirit every part; Hence deem'd divine, the world his merit own'd, With riches loaded, and with honours crown'd. From all their charms combin'd, with happy toil, Did Annibal compose his wond'rous style: O'er the fair fraud so close a veil is thrown, That every borrow'd grace becomes his own. LXXI. Nature and Experience perfect art.If then to praise like their's your souls aspire, Catch from their works a portion of their fire; Revolve their labours all, for all will teach,— Their finish'd picture, and their slightest sketch, Yet more than these to Meditation's eyes Great Nature's self redundantly supplies: Her presence, best of models! is the source Whence Genius draws augmented power and force; Her precepts, best of teachers! give the powers, Whence art by practice to perfection soars. These useful rules from time and chance to save, In Latian strains, the studious Fresnoy gave: On Tiber's peaceful banks the Poet lay, What time the pride of Bourbon urg'd his way, Thro' hostile camps, and crimson fields of slain, To vindicate his race and vanquish Spain; High on the Alps he took his warrior stand, And thence in ardent volley from his hand His thunder darted; (so the Flatterer sings In strains best suited to the ear of kings,) And like Alcides, with vindictive tread, Crush'd the Hispanian lion's gasping head. But mark the Proteus-policy of state: Now, while his courtly numbers I translate, The foes are friends, in social league they dare On Britain to “let slip the dogs of war.” Vain efforts all, which in disgrace shall end, If Britain, truly to herself a friend, Thro' all her realms bids civil discord cease, And heals her empire's wounds by arts of peace. Rouse then, fair Freedom! Fan that holy flame, From whence thy sons their dearest blessings claim: Still bid them feel that scorn of lawless sway, Which Interest cannot blind, nor Power dismay: So shall the Throne, thou gav'st the Brunswick line, Long by that race adorn'd, thy dread Palladium shine.</field>
