      <field name="fulltext">LATER POEMS. BY THE RIVER. Love! of delight the bringer and giver: Under the boughs began my lay, Sitting with Her beside the river; Laughing the glad waves went their way. She whose beauty bewitch'd the Singer (Under the green leaves lovers may) Whisper'd—“I am the joy-gift bringer!” Laughing the glad waves went their way. Love, of delight the bringer and giver!— Under the leaves, in the evening grey, Nothing I hear but the laughing river —Mocking my sorrow's roundelay. YOUNG LOVE. So young were we that when we kiss'd We had no other thought: The joy that first love brought Nought farther miss'd. To watch the dawning of a maiden smile Was worth one's while. In those young days, what though we kiss'd, We kiss'd without a thought: That tender of love sought Did hope assist, 'Twas but as hope helps in a morning dream, When things scarce seem. But now, O Love! whene'er we kiss (Be dumb, my thought!) The joy by her kiss brought Yet more doth miss. O Love! thou wast sufficient in young days For innocent praise. O Love—Desire! renew the kiss That had no farther thought; Or lead to the Besought Whom now we miss: Thee, Hymen,—Love no more enough for us Grown curious. TWO. Two there were in the meadow lying, Under the shade of the blossoming trees; Kiss to kiss gave close replying: Nought else heard but the honey-bees. Two were sitting in Sorrow's shadow; Dead in the cradle their love's fruit lay: Did they think of the sunny meadow And the honey of yesterday? Two are there in the grave-yard lying Under the roots of the blossoming trees; Love with love, but no replying: Nought is heard but the honey-bees. NO MARVEL. —“Love ties a woman's mind Looser than with ropes of hay.” Since Love ties a woman's mind, Though as loose as ropes of hay, Prithee, Love! my Mistress bind, Only for a day. For a day and night, to lay On her thought my faithful mind, While the hay-rope, all one way, Would remain entwined. Dear! such sweetness do I find Here upon the fresh-mown hay, That I marvel not the Wind Will not let it stay. FAREWELL, HOPE! Farewell, Hope! I cry: I'll not mope,—not I. If in her refusal She Will continue, let it be! Other Hope I'll try. I'll not care,—not I: So, Despair, good-bye! Thou shalt never bankrupt me: Love with One as fair as She Yet may share a sigh. Love Thee though I die, Dearest Woe! and why? Too long hast thou pinion'd me: Other Love shall set me free,— One I know, near by. LOVE AND YOUTH. Two winged genii in the air I greeted as they pass'd me by: The one a bow and quiver bare, The other shouted joyously. Both I besought to stay their speed, But never Love nor Youth had heed Of my wild cry. As swift and careless as the wind, Youth fled, nor ever once look'd back; A moment Love was left behind, But follow'd soon his fellow's track. Yet loitering at my heart he bent His bow, then smiled with changed intent: The string was slack. TOO LATE. Yes! thou art fair, and I had loved If we in earlier hours had met; But ere tow'rd me thy beauty moved The sun of Love's brief day had set. Though I may watch thy opening bloom, And its rich promise gladly see, 'Twill not procrastinate my doom: The ripen'd fruit is not for me. Yet, had I shared thy course of years, And young as Hope beheld thy charms, The love that only now endears Perchance had given thee to my arms. Vain, vain regret! Another day Will kiss the buds of younger flowers, But ne'er will evening turn away From love untimelier than ours. THE LILY. Fair slender Flower, and straight, And though so dainty white, Thy beauty may not mate With Her's, my heart's Delight. Though shapely slim and fair, Yet in less fairness dight You fairest lilies are Than Her's, my heart's Delight. Thou but Her emblem art, An image to the sight Of purity, whose heart Is Her's, my heart's Delight. Alas! and thou must fade And perish: such the plight Of flower and flower-like maid,— Even Her's, my heart's Delight. THE RIDDLE. Why do I my Mistress love? Tell me why, if any knoweth, That all Ladies else above Unto Her my duty oweth. I confess Their loveliness: What then doth my preference move? Others are as good and wise, Some are possibly profounder; Even to my adoring eyes Is no saintly halo round her. I confess Their worth: no less Her beyond them all I prize. Love, they say, is always blind: Nay! I see her every failing. Rather Love is as the wind,— Comes and goes, and unavailing 'Tis to guess His waywardness: She is loveliest, to my mind. RUSTIC. Her cheeks—they are twin blush roses; Her breath is the new-mown hay; Right daintily curved her nose is, Ivory carved, you'd say. O rare! Such is my Fair: Why doth she say me nay? Her hair like silk o' the maize is, The Wind hath a golden prize; The Sun in his high noon blazes Can not outshine her eyes. Compare Aught with my Fair! Why doth she me despise? O Venus! but make her willing, Cupid! thy wit employ: Were surely no prettier billing Though Adon had not been coy. O rare! Ah me, my Fair! When wilt thou be my Joy? AMARYLLIS. Mourn, mourn for Amaryllis whom Desire Masked as Love has stolen from our troop! Lament for her, ye Virgins! who could stoop To such base service, quitting Dian's quire. Lament for Amaryllis! Never more Her voice shall lift the hymn in Dian's praise; Her silent ghost, among Love's Castaways, Wanders along the sad Lethean shore. Weep, weep for her! Would that our tears might blot The record of her sorrow and her shame! Love! who beguiled her sense abused thy name: Forgive the blinded eyes that knew thee not! ADONIS. In vain! in vain! I must refuse The love so freely proffer'd me: I may not love but where I choose, Though Venus' self the wooer be. Hadst thou but waited, who can tell What happy gatherer might pass? The fruit that of its own weight fell Is left to wither on the grass. In vain thy love-ripe lips, thy arms Twined round me to compel my stay: Were but reserve among thy charms, Perhaps I had not turn'd away. DIVINER LOVE. Oson of Ocean-foam! in vain Sad Hope thy restless wings would stay; Or Pleasure with her flower-chain Confine thee when thou wouldst away. Woe worth their lives in thee who trust, Child of Desire, whose name is Lust! But thou, O Love the heaven-born, True offspring of the elder God! Thou hold'st this counterfeit in scorn, And blessest those who kiss thy rod. Thy worship yields a joy more deep Than e'er had Adon lull'd to sleep. Thine is the temple, Power Divine! To which I bring this constant heart, An offering at my Lady's shrine, Who in thy services hath part. For her dear sake my gift prefer, And gracious answer give through her! UNDER THE LINDENS. Underneath the lindens' shade Where the bees sweet music made, In the idle June time hot, Dora with her Damon lay: Haply he his love might say,— 'Sooth he would and he would not. Well he loved, but was afraid: As they lay beneath the shade ('Twas all innocent I wot) Dora's head against him leant; Nothing else the maiden meant But she would if he would not. Underneath the lindens' shade, While the bees their music made, Simple love its measure got; Fond looks, honey'd kisses—Well, Something more might be to tell— If I would,—but I would not. ADMIRING LOVE. Like her, the maiden who for years Fed on the scent of flowers fine, Such is my love, which now appears To live but on its thoughts of thine: That sweetness of love-bloom is all My food, my hunger's festival. The grace that halos thee around, Thy beauty's effluence that doth kiss The garden's most removèd bound, My fond condition can not miss,— Who hourly hover round the bloom, Contenting me with its perfume. So modest-humble my delight, Not daring to approach too near, But having thee in constant sight And living in thy atmosphere: No miracle, I may confess,— So fragrant is thy loveliness. LOVE JEALOUS. Time was methought 'twould be enough for love To live by Her, to worship and admire: Poor silly moth! that all too soon must prove The kindling of Love's ire, And play with fire, And drawing nearer, nearer, so be burn'd,— Unknowing that I yearn'd. I look'd as One might on a painting look, Or on a statue fair but marble-cold; I sought not, I admired: Love may not brook A love needs not be told. Now would I fold The picture, the warm statue, to my heart: Now hath Desire his part. Once seem'd it much but listening to Her, Hearing her voice, whose music was so clear It was all pleasure; now I feel the stir Of pain while She is near, Lest others hear. She must be mine, all mine, my very own: So Love at last is known. WHOM I MEAN. Iname her not: but whoso see A fair and gracious dignity That, gentle born, is careful still For blossoming of gentler will (The flower she weareth on her breast), Know well to whom my hope's address'd. I need not name her, Beauty's Queen, Since well ye wot whom I do mean. I need not name her: whoso knows The fairest flower on earth that grows Hath seen her and my riddle known. Pure love her beauty doth enzone, And holdeth in her wavy hair One pearl of constancy most rare. I do not name my heart's fair Queen, Since well ye wot whom I do mean. I name her not. None other name But Loveliest my lips may frame. O hopeful lips! when may you meet In worship at love's service sweet? Sweet Heart, that registers my vows, Such thought of grace my suit allows: Yet name I not love's Fairest Queen, Since well ye wot whom I do mean. A DREAM. I dream'd (ah me! but life is dream-like all!) I lay in a garden fair, Sweet-shaded there By a young peach-tree; and the tree let fall Its blossoms of rich scent On me,—for what that meant. Then question'd I my thought to find what sense My dream interpreted; The answer said “The bloom o' the peach betokens preference.” O heart! if it be true My Lady cares for you. FLOWER-COURTSHIP. I brought my Love a posy well composed To speak for me in words she could not doubt: Sweet basil, box, and broom, And cedar, and the bloom Of red chrysanthemum; And in my left hand, as of choice kept out, A marigold, half closed. My posy well accepted then by her, The marigold she took and smiling threw Where the tall ox-eyes stand; Then from her bosom's band Unloosed with lingering hand A single aster,—but with impulse new Pluck'd for me lavender. Sweet Basil, Good wishes.—Box, Constancy.—Broom, Humility.—Cedar, I live for thee.—Chrysanthemum, I love thee.—Marigold, Cruelty.—Ox-eye, Be patient.—Aster, I'll think of it. “Owning her love, she sent him lavender.” LOVE ONCE. Love once is nought but love alway: They never loved whose hearts can say Love was: for true love can not change; 'Tis only fancy loves to range. So reasoning, this content I drew: —Belinda might not be untrue. She told me, perhaps thought, she loved: But love so easily removed Is fickleness, mere Venus froth,— Just now I like and now I loathe. Such shimmer of a shifting sea Was all Belinda's “love” for me. Belinda, like the passing wave, May much embrace, but never gave Herself. A shell on ocean foam Were our Belinda's likeliest home. So, reasoning thus, content I knew: The Unloving to herself was true. ROSALIND. On every tree the graven rind Retains the name of Rosalind; I carved mine with it on each tree; 'Tis she alone that loseth me. I dug into the quarried stone Her name, so should our love be known To latest years: for my reward I found her more than marble hard. “My Rosalind” with idle hand I traced upon the shifting sand, To be by the next flood effaced: Her ebb of love had greater haste. Than stone more hard is Rosalind, And looser than the sand her mind: Hard heart and will infirm I find; Love's grave I dig for Rosalind. OTHER SOME. I'll not mourn though She refuse me, I'll not deeply care; Love shall never so abuse me: There are more as fair. Though I chose Love's White Rose, Lilies may compare. Shall I pine if She deceive me? Die of my despair? Let her, if so please her, leave me! Truth indeed is rare; Yet I'll find To my mind One whose faith is fair. Be She coldly coy, or faithless, I'll not too much care: If her lying leave me scatheless, Her neglect I'll share. Is this wrong? My love-song Finds a burden there. WHY. He pull'd the branch of hazel down, And kiss'd me ere he let it go. 'Twas very sweet: I did not frown: Why did my lover tremble so? Why was he silent as we went Hand fast in hand, the dim wood through? I knew he loved me, knew he meant Love's question. I was silent too. I've not had time to ask him yet. 'Twas but a moment that my heart Beat against his, just now: we met At mother's gate, to kiss, and part. LOVE AFRAID. I dared not lead my arm around Her dainty waist; I dared not seek her lips, that mine Hunger'd to taste: I dared not, for such awe I found, O Love divine! I trembled as my eager hand Her light touch graced; And when her fond look answer'd mine I dared not haste, But waited, holding my demand For farther sign. Sweet mouth, that with so sweet a sound My dread hath chased, And to my lips the holy wine, Love's vintage, placed! Dear heart, that ever now will bound Or rest with mine! WEEP NOT! SIGH NOT! Weep not! Tears must vainly fall, Though they fall like rain: Sorrow's flood shall not recall Love's dear life again. Vain thy tears, Vain thy sobs; As vain heart-throbs Of lonely years Since thou Love hast slain. Sigh not! As a passed wind Is but sought in vain, Sighs, nor groans, may not unbind Death's unbroken chain. Sighs and tears Nought avail; Nor cheeks grown pale In lonely years. Love comes not again. ROSY WINE. My Mistress' frowns are hard to bear, And yet I will not quite despair; Nor think, because her lips I leave, There's nothing for me but to grieve. —The goblet's lip awaiteth mine: My grief I quench in rosy wine. Dame Fortune too has faithless gone: But let her go! I will not moan. Draw in your chair, old Friend! and see What rating Fortune has from me. Clink yet again your glass with mine,— To Fortune's health, in rosy wine! Pass, Fortune! pass, thou fickle jade! One fortunately constant maid Smiles on me yet; though loves depart, Her presence gladdeneth my heart. Thy tendrils cling, O loving Vine! My griefs I quench in rosy wine. TO SORROW. I loved sweet Sorrow in my early youth: To-day we are but friends. Companions then, and now she only lends Her presence for a while, Graced with a smile Of more content than ruth. She loved me well in those confiding days; Perhaps she loves me still. 'Tis I am traitor, careless to fulfil The faith we pledged of old: 'Tis I am cold, Who turn me from her gaze. Reproachful Sorrow! art thou yet as fond? Ah me! my heart is dead. In that grey dawn our loves so fairly sped, Thou wooest now in vain: And yet remain! I will not look beyond. LOVE'S SERVICE. Hast thou no pity, Love! for thy poor thralls? No ruth for all the sorrow that befalls Thy hapless servitors? Even so I pray'd To Him, the lord of earth and sea and air; And he my foolish prayer Deign'd answer, and thus said: “I have no pity. Whoso serve me ask Nor wages nor reward; but of their task Make their delight—the joy divine of pain, Sometimes,—but none the less it is delight. In their great grief's despite, Sufficient is their gain.” I am not worthy, Love! to claim a place In thy close sanctuary; but of thy grace Admit me to the outer courts, and so In time that inner worship I may learn, And on thy altar burn The Sacrifice of Woe! MADAM! NO! Madam, no! and leave thy wiles: Though I own thee fair, I in truth mistrust the smiles That any fool may share. I must quit, despite thy charms (Truly they are rare), But those all-embracing arms Can not detain me there. Madam, no! my heart may yearn; Love indeed could wait— Cared I but to take my turn With those who crowd thy gate. NO MORE. No more! no more!— O happy Youth, so fearless, frank, and fair! Thou comest with the blossoms in thy hair No more, no more. No more, no more!— O happier Love! one fairest fair blush-rose Thy garden had, the Flower of Hope, that grows No more, no more. No more, no more!— Long-parted Joy! ah, whither hast thou flown? Youth pass'd, Hope wither'd, and thy voice is known No more, no more. SLEEPING ON LATMOS. Awake, Endymion! How art thou sleeping still? What light step climbs the hill, What brightness cometh on? Awake, Endymion! Wake, For Phœbe's sake. Awake, Endymion!— What dream hath lit his smile? Was it that very while Her love around him shone? Awake, Endymion! Wake, For Phœbe's sake. Awake, Endymion!— Wilt thou not wake for this? And his still lips a kiss Divine from fond lips won. Now wake, Endymion! Wake, For Phœbe's sake. NOT FLATTERING. O no! her eyes are not like stars, Her hair's not threads of gold; And for her voice, it rather jars On me to hear her scold. Her nose is good, say for a scent; Her mouth, I own, is wide; And heaven a knack of laughing lent To show the teeth inside. Her smile is pleasant, I allow; Her lips, well,—they are curved, Enough for kissing-gear,—I vow Her lover'd not be sterved. Such as she is, this maid I love; If she'll have me for man, I'll prize her, fairer girls above, As fairly as I can. TO PANSIES. “The pansy maidens heartsease call.” Pure maiden thoughts, doubt not, ye are: And yet sometimes we see Your colour richer and bizarre As Venus' pansies be. So be it! who would change the flower Grown at its own sweet will? Our only wish with every hour To find the heartsease still. CRIPPLED. Trail thy broken pinion, Love! Bind thine eyes with sorrow: I, no more thy minion, Love! Bid thee Good-morrow. Useless to dissemble, Love! Never can we borrow Past content: dost tremble? Love! Bid thee Good-morrow. Limp away! forget me, Love! I have wed with Sorrow. My prayers do not let thee, Love! Bid me Good-morrow! MULIDOR. Her eyes are brighter than a greedy dog's; Her hair is yellow as a shock of grain; Her suppley limbs are nimbler than a frog's Leaping from out a pool and in again. Heigho, dildido! An I love her in vain? Her throat's round as a sack of wheaten flour, Wherefrom issues rare music as she speaks; Her bosom's soft and white as snowy shower; Redder than roses are her ruddy cheeks. Heigho, dildido! Her have I loved for weeks. She gambols gaily as a youngling sheep; Or walks more stately than a swimming swan: To tell of her perfections, all the heap, 'Od wot, the longest day it were not done. Heigho, dildido! I am so love-begone. LONG AGO. Did I love you? Well you know. Did you love me? Who can say? Yet may be you did one day Long ago. Do you love me? Answer No. Yet I smile, nor will complain: It was sad to love in vain Long ago. Do I love you? May be, though Love is silent, seeks not gain: I remember love was fain Long ago. FAINT HEART. Faint heart wins not lady fair: Victory smiles on those who dare. There is but one way to woo: Think thy Mistress willing too; Leave her never chance to choose, Hold her powerless to refuse! If she answer thee with No, Wilt thou bow and let her go? When, most like, her No is meant But to make more sweet consent: So thy suit may longer be, For so much she liketh thee. Never heed her pretty airs! He's no lover who despairs; He's no warrior whom a frown Drives from his beleaguer'd town; And no hunter he who stops Till his stricken quarry drops. Aim as certain not to miss; Take her as thou wouldst a kiss! Or ask once, and if in vain, Ask her twice, and thrice again: Sure of this when all is said,— They lose most who are afraid. HAPPENING. Last evening, carrying home my gift Of fresh wild fruit in cool leaf laid, I met the little neighbour maid; And my ripe offering went adrift. I hear of others. So they take— These fair young thieves, the dues of Eld. How may such larcenies be quell'd? Tell me, some Matron! for love's sake. HOPE AND WISH. Ay! if Love for wishing cared not, Or content with hoping dared not, Thou and I might love for ever: But our hopeful wishes,—they Must forbid our longer stay: Therefore must we sever. Dearest! tell Hope to forsake thee; Say to Wish—Thou shalt not take me, Love and I are friends for ever: Or tell Wish from thee to stray; Hope forbid to watch and pray: So we may not sever. So we never shall be parted; So, although I broken-hearted Die, despairing of endeavour, My poor ghost with thee shall stay: Love, were Hope and Wish away, From thee could not sever. FOR STRENGTH. Break not, O heart! Stern manhood bear the test! Thou winnest not, but thou hast loved the Best. So part! Be strong, my heart! Be strong, my heart! And strain thy level eyes Beyond this pain, lest Weakness thee surprise. Depart! Break not, my heart! FAIREST. What the earth has of most fair, Tell me! —'Tis the Rose, When her young buds first unclose In the dew-sweet air. Nay! not so: For I know One more fair than fairest Rose. What most pure as well as fair? Tell me! —'Tis the Sleet, Treading swiftly with fine feet The light floor of air. Nay! not so: For I know One as pure as driven sleet. What has life of joy most rare? Tell me! —It must be Love as glad as mine for Thee, Lady pure and fair! Nay! not so: For I know Greater joy, thy love for me. THE PRAYER TO DIANA. Goddess of the silver bow! Unto thee my days I vow:— Guard me in thy sylvan shade From all terrors for a maid; From all wildness prowling round Keep me, in thy virgin bound. Love,—I will not heed his shaft, Maiden wit defies his craft; Hymen,—better Dian's light Than his flame, however bright: Goddess! take me for thine own. —She forgot Endymion. Even while the girl did pray, Phœbe was upon her way To the happy Latmos cave; Yet to her votary she gave, In despite of loving haste, Answer holy, pure, and chaste. Worship thou among my train, Looking not for Love, nor fain Hymen's flaring torch to invite To my realm of calm delight! Wait!—And farther had said on, But stopp'd to kiss Endymion. UNDER A CHERRY TREE. O cherry Tree! O Cherry Tree! That Spring-time was so fair: Thy boughs were a white heaven to me, For He was there. O Cherry Tree, glad Cherry Tree! He said my red lips were Richer than thy ripe fruit: ah me! He kiss'd me there. O cherry Tree, sad Cherry Tree! Now are thy branches bare: The leafless boughs repeat to me— He is not there. CAMOMILE. My Love is like the Camomile (A Lover so complain'd), That trampled groweth more the while And flourisheth disdain'd. The rose upon my Lady's breast Will fade within an hour; But that, down-trodden, sore oppress'd, Outliveth scorn and stour. So in my heart the bitter weed Uplifteth its despair, And bideth until wholesome heed Shall move my Lady's care: Content to kiss her trailing gown— O love-fed Sorrow! smile; For see, my Lady louteth down To pluck the Camomile. HER RIVALS. I grant that others have beguiled My fancy, Love! from you: But even as on them I smiled, My heart was not untrue. I own one moment your eclipse Behind that golden hair: But while her kiss was on my lips Your name was whisper'd there. And she whose ready blush on cheek Half met my love confess'd, Heard me in fonder accents speak Of One still loved the best. German the first, the other French: I loved them, Dear! before I courted you. You jealous wench! What, never see them more? Nay! by the lovely golden-hair'd, By her whose blush I own, You'll pardon, their sweet names declared, —Moselle and Rose-Bourgogne. DIRGE. Blooms o' the May, with dew impearl'd, Sweet pale roses of the Spring, Bring, and heap For her pillow, where uncurl'd Those soft tresses may be laid. Gentlest Sorrow! lay the Maid Down, to sleep. No harsh sound disturb her rest! Silent—keep thy nest, O Lark! Dark! awake That fond plaint thou lovest best. Tune thy requiem, Nightingale! —Out, alas! can Song avail For Her sake? IN HER GRAVE. Beauty in her grave is lying: Love's last words are said, Silent Sorrow still replying— Still with tears unshed, For the Lovely and the Lost. O sad heart! thou dost Too well know Nor Love nor Woe Hath gain of their vain crying. Beauty in her grave is sleeping, Strown with fragrant bloom. O, in vain, vain this upheaping Dead sweets on a tomb! Love and Sorrow! come away. O sad Death! thy prey Can not know Or love or woe. Let us go, yet weeping! TRICKSY. It was a tricksy girl, I wot, albeit clad in grey: She woo'd me, an I would or not, and stole my heart away. This tricksy maid This trick she play'd One warm spring day. So sad, so simple, so demure, 'twas nothing she might say, But wimpled eyes which did secure the prize of all her play. This tricksy maid: Love-sick, I play'd My heart away. SPRING AND AUTUMN. “Thou wilt forget me.” “Love has no such word.” The soft Spring wind is whispering to the trees. Among lime-blossoms have the hovering bees Those whispers heard? “Or thou wilt change.” “Love changeth not:” he said. The purple heather cloys the air with scent Of honey. O'er the moors her lover went, Nor turn'd his head. THE LAW OF CHANGE. They know not Love who love to range: As who would sip from wine to wine Loses all taste in his exchange, And sups at length with Circe's swine. Love's self comprised the world at first; But, grown monotonous, Desire (With itch of restlessness accurst) Began the outer world to admire. Might I but Cleopatra know— Whose varied charms no use could stale: So, sounding love from high to low, From low to high, complete the scale. Yet, Helen! I would meet thy smiles, And clasp Aspasia to my heart; Then Sappho's frenzy, Lais' wiles, Experience, proving every part. Fool! Change itself content debars: In seeking all thou hast not One. Who shuts out light, to see the stars, May see them, but has lost the sun. IF LOVE MIGHT LAST. If Love might last for ever, And Beauty keep her youth, Fond hearts now forced to sever Should 'scape remorse and ruth: If Love might last for ever, And Beauty keep her youth. If Love's sole name were Pleasure, And Beauty were not vain, Content might mete its measure, And tears be sweet as rain: If Love knew only pleasure, And Beauty were not vain. If Beauty bloom'd for ever, And Love were constant Truth, Or Love well-dower'd Endeavour, And Beauty queenly Youth,— Love then would love for ever, And Beauty wed with Truth. FIE, LOVE! FIE! Unto Love my Lady said— “Fie, Love! fie! Counselling a young maid to wed: Wed no man will I.” Love! I pray thee—do not fail, Since unless thou weight the scale All my prayers may not prevail. Ay, Love! ay. “Cease (she said) to speak his praise! Fie, Love! fie! What know maidens of men's ways? Men for love will lie.” Tell her, Love! some men are true; And I, one among the Few, Ask not more than is my due. Ay, Love! ay. A PROVERB. “A merry heart goes all the way, Your sad heart tires in a mile-a!” And well for the happy one to say, Made glad by your smile a while, ha! If your smile may be for only a day, Might it last for even a mile-a, How happy could I be, would you say “I will walk with you that mile”! Ah! O sad sad heart! for she turn'd away: We had not travel'd a mile-a. There's nothing for it but Welladay And Alas for the loss of a smile! ha! LOVE'S BLINDNESS. They call her fair. I do not know: I never thought to look. Who heeds the binder's costliest show When he may read the book? What need a list of parts to me When I possess the whole? Who only watch her eyes to see The colour of her soul. I may not praise her mouth, her chin, Her feet, her hands, her arms: My love lacks leisure to begin The schedule of her charms. To praise is only to compare: And therefore Love is blind. I loved before I was aware Her beauty was of kind. SEASONS. Blue flowers twined in the golden hair, Bright in the sun and the fresh Spring air, Childhood's laugh with the promise there. Climbing the apple boughs among, Shaking the fruit down,—with a song: Youth! such pleasures to thee belong. Rich are the colours on falling leaves, Rich is the splendour of crimson eves Or the gold of Autumn's gather'd sheaves. Stooping over the written page, White as the snow and wise as Age:— Which is it — history or presage? THE DAISY. Tell me, Daisy! as I pull Thy petals in the sun,— Does he love me? does he love me? My Belovèd One! Answer, Daisy! as I touch Thy petals; tell my lot! Does he love me? Yes! he loves me. No! he loves me not. Daisy! Daisy! once again. True petals,—Love has won. Does he love me? Yes! he loves me, My Belovèd One! MY VALENTINE. My Valentine! my Valentine! Blue sky! (he said these eyes of mine Were heaven-like) how art thou bright And he not here, my heart's delight, My Valentine? My Valentine! my Valentine! O foolish heart, so prompt to pine, Knowing his love! But love is fear. So sure to come, and yet not here, My Valentine! My Valentine! my Valentine! He comes: can Morn so brightly shine? Sweet lips—But eager love affords No time, nor is there need of words, My Valentine! BARE FEET. O fair white feet! O dawn-white feet Of Her my hope may claim! Bare-footed through the dew she came, Her Love to meet. Star-glancing feet, the windflowers sweet Might envy, without shame, As through the grass they lightly came, Her Love to meet. O Maiden sweet, with flower-kiss'd feet! My heart your footstool name! Bare-footed through the dew she came, Her Love to meet. HAPPY DAYS. O happy days of innocence and song! When Love was ever welcome, never wrong; When words were from the heart, when folk were fain To answer truth with truthfulness again. O happy days of innocence and song! O blessed days of unforbidden joy! When gentle Love was yet a thoughtless boy, Unchidden for his boldness, yet afraid, For that he loved, to importune his Maid. O vernal promise of eternal joy! O happy days of unrestrained song! Days unto which fond memories belong: A golden dawn that never may return, Howe'er the poet's heart for you must yearn, O happy days of innocence and song! THE SILENCED SINGER. The nest is built, the song hath ceased: The minstrel joineth in the feast, So singeth not. The poet's verse, Crippled by Hymen's household curse, Follows no more its hungry quest. Well if Love's feathers line the nest. Yet blame not that beside the fire Love hangeth up his unstrung lyre! How sing of hope when Hope hath fled, Joy whispering lip to lip instead? Or how repeat the tuneful moan When the Obdurate's all my own? Love, like the lark, while soaring sings: Wouldst have him spread again his wings? What careth he for higher skies Who on the heart of harvest lies, And finds both sun and firmament Closed in the round of his content? EARLY POEMS. A REQUIEM. Yet fresh petals of dropt blossom Strew upon her loveliest bosom! Heap dark pansies at her feet! Thyme and briar-roses sweet, And the snow-flakes of the May, If still lingering, softly lay All about her garment neat, Broidery fit for winding-sheet! Water-lilies round her head Wreathe! So white regrets the dead Attend. Whatever of most fair Wild or garden hath be there: Keeping Her, since she must die, Fragrant in our memory!</field>
