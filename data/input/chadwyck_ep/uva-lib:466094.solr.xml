      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATORY. TO MY MOTHER. MOTHER, whate'er of tuneful power I have Was thine since first the flood of life began To mix the lime that built me up a man, And moved me out of darkness. For my wave, Sprung from thy deeps, was rhythmic, stave on stave Tuned to thy beating heart the current ran Charged with such music as will last my span And leave some simple verse upon my grave. Wherefore, as waves that from the ocean's bound Drawn deeply back return with added voice, Line after line let fall upon the beach, I render back to broken shores of speech What thought flows in upon the tide of sound, And know that thou wilt listen and rejoice. DEDICATORY. TO THE DEAR MEMORY OF MY FATHER. FATHER! not here, but dearest father still, Since neither depth below nor height above Avails to break the bond of deathless love That keeps my sonship loyal, on the hill Crowned with its solemn church and restless mill, How oft thine ear, not ever false, would prove The measure that my schoolboy fancy wove, In praise or blame considerate of my skill. The sea-wind stirred thee, when we crossed the plain Toward the beach that fired young Franklin's soul, The whispering reeds, the poplar-girdled farms Upon thy spirit laid melodious charms,â I heard the Mantuan's music from thee roll, Breathed forth in sweetly meditative strain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK I. SONNETS OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT AND SOUTH COAST. I. SEA LIBERTY. (SUGGESTED BY A COIN OF OLD TARENTUM.) Two thousand years have not unseated thee, Thou dauntless rider of the dolphin king. Thy father's horses with their brass hooves ring In the deep watery stall, but o'er the sea Thou, with exultant arm stretched forth in glee, Wilt guide thy lustrous steed that curvetting Moves thro' the flood, a joyous-hearted thing, Glad as the waves that bound towards Italy. Earth has its charms, the vales, the moveless hills Can soothe the unimpressionable mood And mould the heart they prisonâbut the waves Call with a voice of jubilance that thrills All souls who thirst for swift vicissitude, We clap our handsâwe are no longer slaves. II. OCEAN, THE CAPTIVE. Men call thee free, and I have heard the wind Pass landward, breathed of liberty and thee, Have watched thy white-maned horses prancing free, As if their courses could not be confined: But deeper than the hand of man has mined Are set the bolts of thy captivity; From higher than the eyes of man can see The jealous moon thy limbs doth strangely bind. Thou moanest, âI that am the heaven's own child, Why, laid within the cruel, cradling shores, Should I but grow to feel a prisoner's pains?â And, like a giant fretting in his chains, Thou thunderest at Earth's never-yielding doors, Untamed and tameless and unreconciled. III. THE ISLE OF WIGHT. Isle of the blossoming myrtle and the bay, Of elm, and snowy cliff, and sunny down, King-makers can assure no lasting crown, Song-makers bear the sceptre that must stay. With Beauchamp passed thy dynasty away, But to thy royal seat of high renown Came one whom all the gentle muses own: His reign is young, albeit his locks are grey. Thou hast thy kingânor yet unqueened thou art, Crown-wearied, here, our Sovereign finds her rest, Where, like a jewel that chance blows may turn, Set in the gleaming Solent, thou dost burn To fence from wind and foe our sailor heartâ Thou fairest island-gem on England's breast! VII. AFTER THE EPILOGUE TO THE CHARGE OF THE HEAVY BRIGADE. When blackbirds fluted 'twixt the day and night, And you clomb up the down toward the stars, My heart went with you, for the thoughtful bars Of that last music had possessed me quite. True seer, I cried, you have delivered right The only message that, to heal our scars, Unriddling these dread necessary wars, Can crown with song the soldier's deed of might. For till these bastions crumble with the frost, Or earth shall meet the sun and melt in fire, Some new-won land shall court the jealous eye, Some voice shall startle lust and tyranny, Some heart refuse to own the battle lost, Some patriot find in death his soul's desire. VIII. AT THE NEEDLES, ISLE OF WIGHT. When the PhÅnician sailors, for their store Of moon-white metal, dropped to yonder bay, These broken cliffs were memories day by day Of that far land from whence they plied the oar. For ever 'twixt the sunset and the shore With chalk-hewn hunch the monster camel lay Beneath the bellowing cape, and through the spray They seemed to hear the bull of Babel roar, Giant and human-headed; so they passed With prayer to mighty Melkarth and to Bel, And steered towards the island's furnace fire, They felt o'ershadowed by the walls of Tyre, In fancy saw the smoke of Sidon cast Upon the waters Ashtoreth loved well. IX. BY THE BARROW ON AFTON DOWN, FRESHWATER, ISLE OF WIGHT. Buried beneath this mound, whoe'er ye be, Briton, or Cerdric's sons that smote old Rome, And dispossessed her of this island home, And scared her yelping eagles out to seaâ Before ye slept upon this solemn lea, Between the tranquil Solent and the foam, Ye heard the same voice with the springtime come That fills mine ears and sets my fancy free. For still from winding Yar the peewits call, The waves are loud beneath the white cliff wall, Still from the landward pastures at my feet Lambs tremulous cry and anxious mothers bleat, And in the gorse, new-gilded by the spring, With notes ye knew I hear the blackbird sing. XI. THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE NEEDLES. Thro' the blue mist that mingled night and day, Down the deep Solent's melancholy tide, We, passing swift, three phantom vessels spied, Their sails full setâbut neither swing nor sway; Full to the front toward the darkening bay The reddest moon of harvest seemed to ride, âThe Needles, ho!â a sturdy seaman cried, And all my dream of fancy passed away. Yet much I marvelled how the waters' hand Could rend the rocks, and pierce the Needles thro'; But most at him whose potent skill had planned Such sure protection for the homebound crew,â Who raised this tower, and filled with rosy light The star that sets not upon any night. XII. PORTLAND. Here Hope is dead, and Love has flown away, And only here the beast within the man; By bolt and cage and fortress barbican Curbed, and in chains, can pass hard hours away; Till the red hand is raised again to slay, And feet that once so innocently ran Strive against desperate odds for larger spanâ Then the swift bullet sings, and all is clay. Dark like a gibbet, o'er the quarry hangs The frequent crane, and with its funeral dirge The far-off sea-bell sounds upon the height, And only fear of death avails to urge The sullen toil of the laborious gangs, Till death in mercy bring the dreaded night. XIII. THE MIGUEL D'AQUENDA: WEYMOUTH. The shepherd Britons, dwellers by the sea, Who watched the dark PhÅnicians hither come, Or later heard, along the banks of Frome, The Roman eagles scream, and turned to flee To that green rampart on the Dorset lea, Were not more troubled for their gods and home Than when our fathers saw above the foam The great D'Aquenda's galleon going free. Men clenched their first and muttered; women pale, Pale as the Lulworth cliffs, went sobbing by: âAnd is all lost, and are we prize to Spain? And have our Weymouth gallants fought in vain?â When out above the huge D'Aquenda's sail They saw old England's glorious ensign fly. XIV. PLYMOUTH HARBOUR-SUNDAY. Is it not well that England sends her sons From such proud harbours, such fair haunts as these, To wage their battle with the roaring seas, And shout for victory with their cloudy guns; Here where the shifting wall of white foam runs For ever Soundward, where baronial trees Blend the waves' whisper with the hum of bees And sweet church bells ring down their benisons? Yes, when the sailor's heart is strung for fight Thou, Edgecumbe, shalt be present in that hour, The Hoe and Hamoaze, clear before his sight, Shall nerve his arm and lend his spirit power; And if he fall, yet falling will he smile, Dead for the love of this his native Isle. XV. OLD EDDYSTONE LIGHTHOUSE, PLYMOUTH HOE. Not often do we find old age like this, After long tempest perdurable proved, From out the rush of water floods removed And set on sunny earth of calm and bliss; But it is well, brave tower, though here we miss The fire of resolute-heartedness we loved, The zeal for lives, that, lost in darkness, roved Through booming surges and the breakers' hiss. And if within thy granite-builded core No longer tempest shakes the heart of man, Nor waves without lift hands to quench thy star, The centuries still shall bless thee, and from far, While nations gather marvelling at thy plan, Thine age shall grow in honour more and more. XVI. SIR FRANCIS DRAKE, THE HOE. Mould him in bronze, or hew him out of stone, His name shall live beyond what hands can make, Who with his fifty fighting men durst rake That sea which, heaving cloth of gold, had shone Since first those long grey eyes had looked thereon, And he had felt the South Pacific wake Unconquerable daring,âgallant Drake, Prince, sailor, soldier, buccaneer, in one. Three years 'neath flying suns and wandering moons He sailed his Hind, the sea-scourge of the world, Then, round the Horn, as full as hull could hold Of Devon's courage and of Spain's doubloons, Steered home, but England never since has furled Her sails of enterprise in lust for gold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK II. SONNETS OF THE CORNISH COASTS. I. DEEP-SEA CALM. With what deep calm, and passionlessly great, Thy central soul is stored, the Equinox Roars, and the North Wind drives ashore his flocks, Thou heedest not, thou dost not feel the weight Of the Leviathan, the ships in state Plough on, and hull with hull in battle shocks, Unshaken thou; the trembling planet rocks, Yet thy deep heart will scarcely palpitate. Peace-girdle of the world, thy face is moved, And now thy furrowed brow with fierce light gleams, Now laughter ripples forth a thousand miles, But still the calm of thine abysmal streams Flows round the people of our fretful isles, And Earth's inconstant fever is reproved. II. CORNWALL. World of the yellow gorse, and purple lea, With fruitful ocean sounding in the caves, Rich-veined of earth, whose ever-rolling waves Of harvest ripen on from sea to sea; Thy wells have power, there, saints have bent the knee, Awe guards thy cromlechs, haunts thy moorland graves, And at the crossway, with the sign that saves, Hangs Balder-Christ upon his granite tree. Still on thy greens the fairies dance their round, The brownies haunt the hearth and clot the cream, Tregeagle cries, the wish-hounds chase and chime; Thy cairns with clash of phantom-arms resound, And nights of vision melt to days of dream Filled with romance of old Arthurian time. III. FALMOUTH. Harbour of ample bosom, open door For friends and strangers storm-tost in the bay, Peace has not yet come down on earth to stay, And still 'neath hate's dark night the foe may pour In thro' thy gates, his floating thunder roar Scorn to Pendennis, to the town dismay; Our happy England whole of heart to-day, To-morrow may be England wounded sore. Oh! for the heart of Raleigh, when, returned, He felt our western air blow crisp and cool From off the golden slopes of wheat that burned Against his topmost yards in Smithwic Poolâ Oh! for his voice to put our pride to school, And bid us guard the land for which he yearned! IV. KYNANCE COVE. We passed through primrose scent and orchis bloom, And gained a moorland overblown and drear, But still the lark made music at our ear, And sunny furze forbade a moment's gloom; Then heard we a rememberable boom, And caught a glimpse of water, emerald clear, And down the rough-hewn steps we went with cheer To claim the fisher's ocean-breathÃ¨d room. But the sea called us and we could not stay, And forth we strolled in that new wonder-land To where the old-world rocky lions lay, Their wave-wet haunches glistening o'er the sand, And all the cliffs about us seemed to say We bade men sing, We schooled the painter's hand. V. THE COTTAGE AT KYNANCE COVE. I know a cottage by the Cornish sea Deep in a cove, gold-blossomed to the cloud, Its hearth with music of the wave is loud, Its chamber jocund with the streamlet's glee. About it cries the gull and hums the bee, Above it sings the lark, around it crowd All flowers that love the sun and are not proud, And live their lives out innocent and free. Steep to the threshold fall the cliff-hewn stairs, But on the heights are left all human cares, And only days of thoughtful happiness Descend its seaboard solitude to bless, While still bright leagues of azure and of foam Restrain the feet and make the cottage Home. VI. THE BLOW-HOLE, KYNANCE CAVES. When still the rocks were young, ere thought was born, The same old sea that from the sands is fled Worked at these halls of marble green and red, And still, laborious, toils both night and morn. Here Syrian sailors, of their god forlorn, Saw Derceto rise o'er her cavern bed, Or Latin helmsmen knew the dolphin's head, And heard in fancy Triton sound his horn. But now St. Malo's bells above the moor Swing, and within these hollow ocean caves No human knee is ever bent in prayer, Save when a mother finds her dead boy there, And though the surge blows trumpets at the door No sea-god speaks in thunder from the waves. VII. THE GULL ROCK, KYNANCE COVE. If all the seas that ever sucked the hue From midmost heaven, about dark rocks were rolled, If all the winds that ever gathered gold From out sea-air, upon their foreheads blew, If all the wings of ocean birds that flew, Milk-white upon their ledges dropped to foldâ Then, Kynance, would thy wave-bound fortress hold Blue-girt, gold-washed, wing-whitened, rise in view. Dear to the sailor passing up the Sound, Dear to the wanderers as they westward rove, Landwednack's cape, Landwednack's double eye; But, from Carthillian to St. Levan's bound, No rocks so magical as those that lie The tawny lion-guards of Kynance Cove. VIII. ST. RUMON'S WELL, AT GRADE. Hid in the ocean-girt NemÃ¦an wood Hermit he lived, and here St. Rumon died, This crystal spring his simple want supplied, Wild roots and berries were his slender food. And yet he found the beast in solitude Must needs be fought with; day by day he died, And taught that though the saintliest souls were tried, The cleansed in spirit might be pure of blood. His bones lie far away, but here they bring The May-tide child for healing, maidens here Drop the cross straws to see if love is kind, And here the mother praying, wild with fear, Will ask the well what bodes the rising wind To him she brought as babe to Rumon's spring. IX. AT THE LIZARD. Here first the south wind brings her gift of flowers, Here last about the cliffs the swallows play, Yet neither bird nor flower for long can stay Forth driven by the inhospitable hours. But Hope remains, and here she builds her towers, More durable than granite, bearded grey, Expectant of the bark that passed away From dawn to noon, from noon till night-time lowers. Her stout heart dies not with the dwindling sail, She soonest sees the rising vessel come, The storm winds burst, black skies and ocean meet, Her voice of prayer is heard above the gale, And, when the dead are laid about her feet, She murmurs, âLo the loved one steers for home.â X. A MEMORY OF THE LIZARD. Mine eyes are dim, and yet before mine eyes Roll in dark purple seas that leap to green, And rim the cliffs with music, cliffs that lean And listen to the sea-birds' human cries; Fantastic rocks with their chameleon dyes Move almost into speech, and what they mean The sunlight doth interpret; happy scene, Remade with every headland's swift surprise. There all the land is breathed about with flowers, Thrift, orchis, primrose, and the starry squills; And all the land is wreathed about with gold, Gold gleams the down, and gleams the sea-mew's hold; And at that sunny sight the spirit towers, Weak knees are strengthened, and the faint heart wills. XI. FAREWELL AT LIZARD POINT. We say farewell, the half we never know Of those who wave their hands, farewell! farewell! And so we fade to distanceâit is wellâ If we knew all we leave we could not go. How many a heart beneath the wings of snow, In quest of other lands wherein to dwell, Has passed this headland conscious of a spell, Yet never sighed or felt the full tear flow! These have not known how here the swallow first Bears England summer on her glossy wings, How first about this cape the cuckoo calls, How here upon these southern-hearted walls The earliest flowers to radiant glory burst, And all day long of home the skylark sings. XII. PIGEON HUGO (CORNISH: POETHON OGO=BOILING CAVE). Sheer rocks of pitchy blackness to the skies, With flower-full ledges, gold dust on the walls, O'erhang a tide that when it flows or falls Boils into rage of foam that never dies. There sea-mews circle with distressful cries And constant melancholy; depth appals And height is hopeless; there the raven calls Death, and there Death, the cormorant, replies. Cavern of fury, you dissemble well; Your walls of death and pain with flowers you dress, With gloss of gold you half conceal your spite; You are the very counterfeit of hell, Your central depths dark misery, fathomless, Your open mouth sweet kisses, dear delight. XIII. MULLYON ISLAND (ENYS BRONNEN). He is the perfect man who dares to be Alone, yet not too separate from his kind; Whose forehead meets undaunted every wind, Whose heart is calm in storm or summer sea. To him all helpless ones are fain to flee, And, as they shelter 'neath his counsel, find Consistent truth, and constancy as kindâ To come and go on all occasions free. And thou of this man's nature hast a part, Thou island home of succour by the shore, The waves that strew Polurrian's beach with woe Break round thee, but the wave-beat fishers know Thou hast sweet shelter for the boats in store,â Isle of the genial hand and generous heart. XIV. FLORA DAY AT HELSTON (FURRY DAY), MAY 8. Come, Marion, come, let Robin blow his horn, For Flora holds high festival to-day, The Nansloe woods are fragrant with the May, And Helston Hill is green with springing corn. Come, bring the orchis, break the milk-white thorn, Dance in and out, and let who will say nay, And he, who will not leave his work for play, Shall feel Pengella's waterbrook of scorn. This is the day our British fathers gave To Flora's head their boasted victory's crown, The day our great St. George had power to save, When the fierce Dragon flamed above the town; But on this day we do remember most Spain's huge sea-dragon, slain upon the coast. XV. MOUNT ST. MICHAEL, PENZANCE. Mount of the crescent bay, and Cornish flood, Green-based and grey with towers, about thy feet The timid tides for awe will scarcely meet, Since here th' Archangel Michael gleaming stood; And at the sight eye-blind beneath his hood The hermit shrank, Tregeagle left his seat, And all the Fauns and Satyrs in retreat Went screaming from the dark, mysterious wood. The woods in Lyonnesse are overthrown, Peace holds her pleasant castle on thy hill, Below the beast makes havoc of the man; Still England needs a Michael in her van To slay the dragon, the archangel still, High on his mount of battle must be shown. XVI. SPRING DREAMS AMONGST THE CORNISH MINERS. Land of the horns of plenty! though thy seas No longer feel the strong PhÅnician oar, Nor Carthaginians push their boats ashore To claim a sister Cassiterides; Though those man-moles who marred thy pleasant leas Cease, and the streams run purer than before; Though less the hammers ring, the chimneys roar, And the grim shales grow heathery by degrees; Still when the beech in hollow woods is bold, And April scatters violets thro' the land, When once again the cuckoo's tale is told, And primrose breath on every breeze is fanned, Thy gay gorse vision haunts the mining band, They dream wild dreams of Californian gold. XVII. ST. MADRON'S WELL. (ST. PATERNE, BP. OF AVRANCHES, 6th CENT.) We vex the hills with quarries, and we fell The woods, and as we toil are magnified, And building say,âOur God shall here abide, This is His house wherein He loves to dwell;â But we forget that as we rear the shell Souls are not reared: we shut the heaven outside; Far better had we left the portals wide, As old St. Paterne left them at his well. Led by the wayside cross, from what far lands To yonder spring for health the pilgrims went; And goodly men and maidens plighted troth,â Those drank the waters and these dipped their hands, While birds and flowers, yea all things innocent, Attested health, were sponsors for the oath. XVIII. LANYON CROMLECH. Before the ocean burst his tawny chain And swept the woods of Lyonnesse, and broke In on the altars and their groves of oak, Here men were gathered from the moorland plain: With groaning rollers and the lever's strain, Princes and people stretched an equal yoke, Then from the new-poised cromlech curled the smoke, And the grey granite took a ruddy stain. From Galva, holy Zennor, and the height Of Carn-Brea, throng the worshippers no more, With lamentation and the dead man's praise; But the strong love that crowned this deed of might, And the stern hope for heroes gone before, Stand up rebukers of our faithless days. XIX. THE MÃN-SCRYFA (THE WRITTEN STONE). Brown Caer Galva takes the sun and hears The wailing winds, the sorrow-laden deep, That mourned with all the people for the sleep Of Rialobran, a prince without his peers. But yet he died as heroes dieâthe spears Not ever backward, and the castle keep Unstormed, the kine, the oxen, and the sheep Safe for his father's milk-pail, knife, and shears. How many a chief on Galva's rocky mound Has looked on this lone pillar with a sigh, And prayed his son might meet as brave a death; And those three Saxon kings, that supped hard by, Tossed horns to Rialobran and cursed the wound, Yet could not drive dark sorrow from the heath. XX. A LEGEND OF KING ARTHUR. (AT SENNEN.) Headland of battle, long as choughs shall flyâ The birds with beak and talon wet with blood, As long as Genvor rears her raven brood To croak against the Dane, the victory Of those nine Cornish kings can never die; No mill-wheel turns to-day with crimson flood But all who round the Table-mÃ¢n take food Must pray that Arthur's time again were by. For once Excalibur with gleaming brand Flashed hope to friend, confusion to the foe, But Athelstane on Bollait's fateful field Stamped British hearts to dust that could not yield, And Arthur now on wings of night must go, A deathless chough about a conquered land. XXI. AT THE LAND'S END. Had I but been with that adventurous soul Who by sore need, or love of wandering pressed, Pushed flocks and children towards the glowing west, And crossed the ocean river, but found no goal: From Thames to where the Tamar's waters roll Moved tent and gods, till, on this bastion crest, He felt of all earth's mystery possessed, And deemed of men and lands he knew the wholeâ I too had marvelled: yet unto his ears From forth the sunset vigorously out-thrown Sounds of another world perchance were borne; He heard within the waves the sighs and fears Of human hearts as restless as his own, And fain would follow further from the morn. XXII. FOAM-FRINGE AT GURNARD'S HEAD. Treryn, the castled, stands towards the tide, Grey-lichened, gold-incrusted, green with moss, And all day long, the waves about her toss White arms of foam, as jealous of her pride, But ever down the darkened ledges slide The baffled waters. Though no more the cross Shines o'er the flaming torch to save from loss, Her mystic strength in storm has never died. How like a soul that in the tides of sin Beats back the waves of passion, and secure Makes of those tides new power for innocence, Does this victorious headland seem to win From out the raging waves a silver fence, Wreathed of white foam-bells, peaceable and pure. XXIII. NEW QUAY. As if by foes behind them hotly prest, The pale battalions of the houses stand Upon the utmost verge of the dark land, And look for help to rise beyond the west, Where the sun sinks blood-crimson; but the crest Of wave on wave falls sullen on the strand, Faints into foam that dies, and still no hand Is near to give the routed army rest. There as I gazed I heard between the foam And those brown cavernous cliffs, that split the bay, And swirl the rising waters either way, That happiest sound of children, spade on spade, Patting the mimic castles they had made, And fear gave place to peace, and joy, and home. XXIV. THE CAIRNS, TREVALGA HEAD. The storm-winds break as whitely on Trevose, And bruise Trevalga's cliff to lilac stain, As when they bore thee from the battle plain And laid thee on this headland, and there rose Cries of a kingless people, and the woes Of friends who felt all victory was vain, If here above the melancholy main Beneath his mound the victor must repose. Yet what he did was very bravely done: He slew the wolf, he tamed the long-horned ox, Broke the wild tribes who warred upon his throne, And saved his people and his people's flocksâ And so they set him with his axe of stone Among the mews that wail about the rocks. XXV. THE NUNNERY OF LANHERNE, MAWGAN. I asked the sad-faced, necessary priest, âHow fare you, brother, in this solitude?â âTo be alone,â said he, âfor souls is good, And I, that am the least among the least, Have round about me flower and bird and beast, Bright presences that sociably intrude, And fill in fellowship my loneliest mood, With inarticulate joy that has not ceased.â And as he spake, about his ears there fell A shower of scented blossom, and the drone Of bees and lapse of waters, clang of daws, Mixed with the well-contented rooks' applause Among their nests. Methought I, too, could dwell, Lanherne, in thy sweet valley, and alone. XXVI. A CORNISH SAINT, MAWGAN. IN MEMORIAM MARY DAVY, OBIIT MAY 18, 1884. Lord, how impartially Thou dost prepare For this world's contradiction, holy lives: Now noble dames, now humble peasant wives, Are called to trim their lamps with earnest care, And wait the Bridegroom. In her curious chair Close prisoner, still this aged saint contrives Largesse of love for all who come, and gives, From parish pittance, more than life can spare. Beneath the high starched cap her angel face Is lined with sorrow that has made her wise, Solemn she speaks, and yet she smiles with grace; In her have met the two eternities: A Love that would all human hearts embrace, A Faith that fain would people Paradise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK III. SONNETS OF THE BRISTOL CHANNEL. I. MOON-THIRST. Who knowsâyon ancient planet waterless, Once swayed with ocean; yonder caves, whence night Not ever is dispelled, were swum with light, And floods and verdurous mountains felt the stress Of winds that smote the shining capes, to bless Woodlands with power and ships with men of might: While cloud-encircled and more softly bright The moon walked on in gleaming spotlessness? Now, cold of heart, and evermore accursed With death, white ashes strewn upon her head, Blind on her course the haggard phantom moves; But fierce and unallayable her thirst, To Earth's far seas in vain her hands are spread; She strains to tilt the ocean cup she loves. II. BRISTOL. No more through prayerful gardens glides the Frome: The steam-gods, perched upon their pillars high, Patch with their breath the weary, worn-out sky; Hill-sides are white with smoke, not apple-bloom; A red sun glares through the perpetual gloom; Men stay not now to ask who passes by; From the vexed Avon ever comes the cry Of anxious steamers, questioningââIs there room?â The white sails mix, and move from street to street, The quays are coloured with the dust of ware; Whole nations at the landing-places meet, And foreign cargoes perfume all the air; Only at night, men hear the loud clock's beat And souls regain the anchorage of prayer. III. THE DRAWBRIDGE, BRISTOL. In the laborious heart's exchange there lies A secret chamber, silent, all apart; Men's tears at sudden hush will ever start. Old City, hoarse with manufacture's cries, Whose noise acclaims the busy enterprise, Lo! at the clamorous centre of thy heart, The solemn waters hush the wrangling mart, And peaceful floods bear up thine argosies. The prisoned waves, that quite forget to beat, Stir to the ocean's pulses twice a day; Then, like a dream, the silent-footed fleet Moves to its perfect rest beside the quay; And Bristol, through thy fevered nerves is sent A touch of peace, a sense of calm content. IV. SPIRE OF SAINT MARY REDCLIFFE. By spar and shroud, with their untutored hands, The vessels write their runes upon the sky; Their sails, the careful seamen spread to dry, Seem April clouds entangled in the strands: A multitude from multitudinous lands, Prow close to prow, in friendly purpose lie; And queen of masts, among the forestry, Sun-white Saint Mary's spire in beauty stands. Ship of the Church, these vessels will not stayâ For prize, fresh gains, new venture, will be gone: Unlading at thine anchorage alway Though rough tides threaten, still thou holdest on, Not bartering truth for beads and trumpery, Thy cargoâReason, Love, Fraternity. V. TO A THRUSH HEARD ON CLIFTON DOWN. Clear-throated minstrel! what desires can move Thee, in thy branchy, mist-empurpled swing, When woods are cold, and winds are sorrowing, Thus to rehearse thy last-year notes of love, To thrill with all thy heart the listening grove, To sit, and, with no surety of the spring, To answer every voice the breezes bring, And thine excelling championship to prove? In the dead winter of an early sorrow, No thought of quickening spring my spirit cheers; But as I hearken, of thy strength I borrow, Hope with thy music mingles in mine ears, Thou, who so cheerly settest forth the morrow While round thee million buds are wet with tears! VI. ON THE DOWNS, NEAR BRISTOL. The lounging Roman, who, in days of yore, Watched the low galley from the Severn side Crawl with its hundred arms upon the tide, Or disembark the green-incrusted ore,â He wist not of thy rising, Bristol, more Than I, who on this sunny rock astride, Can think that yonder ships in dumbness glide To dockyard clamour, and to harbour roar. Eye-blinding selfishness! the conqueror dreamed No other city mightier than Rome, And I, who to these silent downs have come, For me alone their health and beauty seemed, Nor thought I once, beyond the hill there lies A city's travail, with its throes and cries! VIII. OLD CLEVEDON CHURCHYARD. Where Hallam rests upon his hill-side green, An arm the dark land puts to sea, and there Two isles are lifted, separate and sheer; With constant watch the Severn moves between: On this one, silence evermore hath been, From that, by day the cannon's voice is clear, At night, a flame to vessels far and near, The crimson-headed lighthouse tower is seen. Ye rock-built monuments that stand apart, One dark and dumb, one loud and lit with fire, Emblems of those immortal friends ye are! Death's waters flow betwixt you,âone, his heart Is hushed; one's love is loud, his words of fire Shine through grief's night, a pure memorial star. IX. HENBURY PLAIN. Ye kindred spirits of the earth and sea, Who love the greeny levels of the main, For ease of foot lies stretched yon even plain, Enamelled green as springtide grass may be. But if to hunt for posies ye agree, White garlands from the sunny waves to gain, Lo, daisies flash, where sprang white drops of rain, Waves break in bloom from tree to hawthorn-tree! And are ye loth to leave that silver store The giddy Wye the solemn Severn yields? A larger treasure waits you in these fields, Youth, calm, and beauty mingle on the shore. There, one low tune the shells are whispering; Here, echo ranges while the gay birds sing! X. TINTERN ABBEY. When with strict clause and overbearing creed Men cramped the truth, then, Tintern, it was well, The hurricane of kingly passion fell Upon thy splendour! For God's flower has need Of light and air; and, like the thistle-seed, Must flutter here, and there must, pausing, dwell. Oft self, not Christ, chose out the hermit's cell, Unfeeling use, not love, would count the bead. Grey ruin, with thy protestant reproof, The clouds do paint, the stars emboss thy roof, Where stone was carved, green ivy sculptures thee; Warm-hearted sunshine now may enter free; And I, who crush the daisies as I kneel, Can thank thy founders, and their purpose feel. XI. AT TINTERN ABBEY. Peace, Strongbow, peace! God rest thee, Walter Clare; And thee whose sons did bear thee to thy grave! The tended turf has muffled all the nave, And tufts of green have carpeted the stair; And if we hear not now the hum of prayer,â Far oxen's mellow cry, the fall of wave, The pattering rain, the moan of winds that rave,â Such sounds, of your old lives will keep us 'ware! No more De Bigod's deeds of battle flame From storied panes along the chancel floor, For God has filled the window to His Name With cloud, and mountain, and with sunny moor; And through the open quatrefoils, in spring, Where sad monks chanted, joyous blackbirds sing. XII. THE DRAKESTONE EDGE. Oh, where is heaven more near, the earth more fair? About their pools the quiet farms are seen; Elms canopy the flock, the hawthorns screen The fresh young wheat, and every rippling square Proclaims man's toil and God's continuÃ¡l care; A flood of pearl, the Severn shines between, And black and busy from the hills of Dean The mines send forth their witness to the air. Walls fence the farms, trees fence the sunny fields, Sails watch the land, and mountains watch the sails, High overhead Heaven's solemn guard prevails, And earth is bright with vision of God's peace; But Tyndale, thy strong tower can tell that eyes Beyond such scene beheld God's Paradise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK IV. SONNETS OF THE WELSH COAST. I. THE SEASONLESS OCEAN. Earth has its seasons, lo! the forests burn To winter ash, or flutter into green; But thou, with heart unchangeable, hast seen No fresh-born colour with the spring return. Thy snows are strewn with strangest unconcern On August waves, thy moving fields are green In cold mid-winter: centuries intervene, Stars set, but none thy long year's changes learn. Across the unimpressionable plains Of water seasonless, the seasons move; Though that proud equatorial flame, the sun Stoops still to send new summer through thy veins Not ever yet thy ocean face was won To tell which way the glancing swallows rove. II. AT BARMOUTH. Sweet is the house that breathes the ocean air, High o'er the sunny beach and tide of green: If you would enter, you must push between Valerian's coral fringe, and mount a stair Wet with the honey-dew; there, simple fare Is swiftly spread; there, wearied, you may lean On couches fit for sea-dreams; freshly clean, The rooms are bright with hospitable care. Thence you may view how Mawddach to the sun Gleams, how the moon o'er Turra rises slow, And cool at evening watch the wan sea fall: But if you choose to climb the crystal wall Of Bermo's crag, aloft the rock-steps run To where the heather and the foxgloves grow. III. THE ABERMAW. As if beyond the height where Mawddach dreams, From Diphwys, Arran, or the Giant's chair, The deep blue fountains of the middle air Had broke, and swept in countless sunny streams To flood of diamond azure, Aber gleamsâ Sings through the bridge without a sign of care, And slips by Bermo's island-shoal of prayer, Till one great turquoise, flood with ocean seems. River of Heaven, the men who drank the Dee Fought bravely, bravely fought Glendower's men, Remembering thee and green Dolgelly's dales; Thou art as free and beautiful as then, And like a lover, the unconquered sea Follows thee daily to the heart of Wales. IV. LOW TIDE IN THE ESTUARY, BARMOUTH. The river failed as if a wizard's wand Had smote it; where dark Idris mirrored lay, Behind his woody skirts and range of grey, Was unreflecting waste and wrinkled sand; No life, no light, but here and there a band Of hyacinthine blue, that stole away, Like to a guilty thing, toward the bay, And left the boats heeled helpless on the strand. Then from the central sea a whisper came, The salt white water swam as smooth as oil, Swept o'er the shoals of sun and flickering gold. Other, but inconceivably the same, Incessant, but without a sign of toil, Renewing all, the generous tide was rolled. V. BARMOUTH SHORE. A WALK TO LLANABER. The sea was moveless azure in the bay, Yet the blue sea of Heaven was white with foam, As if the winds for mischief's sake would roam To steal the sense of too great calm away. Great Turra stretched a marvellous inlay Of wall and wood towards the Giant's home; And Hebog's hill, Carnarvon's bride, had come Across the waters in her veil of grey. I left the rushy hillocks, and I strolled Along the purple shore that pulsed with heat, To where Llanaber's fathers o'er the tide Sleep till the tides are not;âa death-bell tolledâ Rest for the weary-hearted ones is sweet, Dear God! to-day 'twere bitter to have died! VI. A RETROSPECT FROM MAWDDACH CRAG. Once more I sit on Mawddach's craggy height And hear the green grasshopper at his fun; Mad fellow he, with hawkweed for his sun, Whose stars by dayâhe knows not any nightâ Are clustered saxifrages. His delight Fills me: my days far inland back have run, I feel as if some wizard hand had spun My cares, my age, my sorrow, out of sight. But as I gaze, the emerald tide beneath Shrinks, and to clouded azure seems to turn, And from the depths the barren sands arise; And Iâagain the tears are in mine eyesâ I know my years are flowing out to death, Are leaving sand and shallow, and I mourn. VII. BARMOUTH BRIDGE. Not for thy beauty, with thy thousand feet Stretched over idle sand and stormy tideâ Not for thy voice, though ever at thy side Eolian whispers in the gale are sweetâ Do men revere thee; but because the fleet Fire-breathing chariots safely o'er thee glide, And ere thy long, low, thunder-roll has died, The news of half the world is in the street. Yet, Barmouth Bridge, tho' Arthog's wood by thee, And Turra's sunny slope and torrent streams, Seem presences that dance across thy span, I count thee dear for thisâthe gentlest man Who ever wove the sonnet from his dreams Thought of thy wonders rising from the sea. VIII. COTTAGES OF ST. GEORGE, BARMOUTH. Master of men, who love this land too well To say and do notâthey who climb this height, And after toil find peasants' rest at night,â They know your purpose; these your name will tell With gladness, for their lives have felt the spell Of this grey rock, and their grey eyes are bright, Their hearts like eagles, light as air is light; High-souled, above the sordid earth they dwell. They have no greed of wealth, the saxifrage Has starred the cottage roof with guiltless gold, And far beneath the liquid sapphire shines; Their heads are hoar, but when in silver lines The old sea breasts the bar with noble rage, They feel its vigour through their bosoms rolled. IX. THE TORRENT WALK, DOLGELLY. Across the bridge and thro' the huddled town, Along the oak-clad river bank we passed, Our eyes perforce were ever backward cast To where dark Moel looked in grandeur down; But still The Torrent claimed us for its own, And those grey Arrans eastward held us fast, Till sudden, at the tale of blood aghast, We fronted Offryn, and its hideous frown. We turned to thread a hollow murmuring vale, From step to step a streamlet downward sprung, Now laughing white, now solemn pool on pool; No more distressed for Cymric Offryn's tale, From sun to shadow, and from heat to cool, We heard a torrent speak our English tongue. X. HARLECH. Above the waves shine out the milk-white sands, High o'er the sands a headland rock, o'ergrown With ivy, wears a castle for its crown, And gold with soft sea-lichen, Harlech stands. Sighs of a captive maid, the fierce commands Of Collwyn, mad with Gwynedd, and the frown Of Owain Glyndwr struggling for his own, And Anjou's Margaret wringing anguished hands,â These, Harlech, at thy bidding start from sleep. But most, when winds are hushed, and tides are low, From thy round-towered sanctuary steals A tramp of men, a clash of armÃ¨d heels, And by the music's mellow march I know How, four years long, great David held the keep. XI. BRONWYN THE FAIR. HARLECH. Small wonder that the child of BrÃ¢n the blest, Grew into grace no prince's wealth could dower, Seeing her hair shone yellow as the flower That gilds the plain in summer, and her breast Was white as is the sand that curls its crest Seaward to bar the ocean; from her tower Her blue eyes saw blue tides that changed each hour, And golden heaved the waters to the west. But whether June had laid the land in gold, Or winter swept its silver to the green, When larks leapt up to shake the air with glee, Or hoarsely on the beach the wave was rolled, Her being drank all beauty from the sceneâ Yet one thing lacked: wave, air, bird, flowers were free. XII. THE BURIED CITY OF CARDIGAN BAY. When son of Seithynâbe his name accursedâ Because he could not brook the drunkard's shame Yet would be drunkard, felt his blood aflame Against the king who made him chief and first; And so from banquet stole, and let the thirst Of that old sea share with him drunkard's name, He deemed the depths would bury his ill fame, And fearlessly Caer Gwyddno's dams he burst. The moon was full, flowed in the salt sea tide, O'er farm and byre the bitter waters ran, Reconquered all man's war from ocean won, But still the breezes sigh, as Gwyddno sighed, And still along the shores of Cardigan The storm-waves hiss a curse for Seithyn's son.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK V. SONNETS OF THE LANCASHIRE AND CUMBERLAND COASTS. I. EAST AND WEST. Beyond the marsh and reedy meadow land, By that old rampire that the Romans drew, In boyish exultation for the view Of waves that filled the creeks and swept the strand, How oft I ran bare-footed, spade in hand, To mound my rampire, cheering on the crew Of brother-builders where the tide broke through, Upon that happiest reach of eastern sand! Grey shore! bewitcher of my boyhood's days, The shadows lengthen, westward now I turn To that sweet sister beach of sand and shells And rushy margent, backed by Cumbria's fells, Where ocean bends, and sunsets burn and burn In glory and illimitable praise. II. THE TOWER ON THE HOAD, ULVERSTON. Look from thy towerâstrong wish we mortals have That deeds should beremembered after deathâ Look forth, and tell the listening lands beneath, From torchy Furness to the charnel cave Of Heysham's cliff, that since the Leven's wave, With confluent Craik, at tide-time held its breath And halted up the vale, no surer wreath Than duty honoured can outlive the grave! If hence no rosy star at sunset gleam, To guide the keel that beats from shoal to shoal, And cheer the sailor on his lonely road, White as thy tower, high-lifted, still must beam The lamp that lit thee, Barrow, to thy goal, A nation's honour on thy native Hoad. III. A LAUNCH FROM THE FURNESS DOCKS. Dread expectation seals our open lips: A hundred hammers fall, their work is done; Out from the keel the busy craftsmen run, The tender riband that a child's hand snips, Looses the giant down the groaning slips, And, with a thrill of life through every ton, It leaves behind a rift of sky and sun, And plunges seaward, mightiest of ships. A toy, the ponderous anchor leapt and ploughed, But ere the smoking of its passage died, I saw the breakers turn and toss ashore The flotsam of its cradle-timbers proud, Prelude of wreck, indignant that it bore Another burden laid upon the tide. IV. BLACK COMBE. Who leaves the Ruin of the Nightshade dale, The clouds of Furness, and the stithy roar, And seeks by Duddon, Millom's haunted shore, Or stands on Ireleth's slopes of quarry shale,â Must feel, Black Combe, thy mystery prevail. Not unimpressed by thee did men of yore Broider thy skirts with Druid circles hoar, They heard thee speak with words that never fail. About thy mottled flanks of green and gold, Strange organ-notes of worship from the sea Steal up and die, or linger half expressed; And added sounds of human melody Tell, how repentant Lancelot, in his quest For peace, found God, foreshadowed here of old. V. ESKMEALS. Oh, joy, where sea and river waters meet, To watch how swift the wading dotterels ply Their rosy stilts in pools of bluest sky, To hear cool sprinklings from their dainty feet! To lean and listen to the flutings sweet Of sandpiper, or sad-voiced plover's cry; While the grave heron at his fishery Gleams like a silver sickle through the heat! Blest be the tide that bared these tawny shelves, For such a world of food and innocent play! Man, weary man, with sorrow digs and delves, But is not glad in winning bread, as they, Who wait on God, and, careless of themselves, Take that which Nature else had thrown away. VI. AT KING HENRY'S CHAPEL, MUNCASTER. Where Esk in curves and coils of moony light Gleams down the vale and passes to the sea, They tell how royal Henry once did flee, A crownless king, from Hexham's bloody fight; And how rude shepherds, on a summer night, Found, and conveyed him, where, on loyal knee, Stout Pennington did pledge his own roof-tree For safety, till the Red Rose had the right. If morn had brought to that unhappy king Vision of stately trees enleaved with gold, Or half the beauteous calm mine eyes behold, Sure it had been a sad awakeningâ Such reminiscence of his golden state, And he, discrowned, forsaken, desolate! VII. A QUIET AUTUMN DAY,FROM THE TERRACE AT MUNCASTER. Fetched from the solemn deeps, at flow of tide, The Esk brought sun and silence to the vale; The yellow woodlands, weary with the gale, Murmured no more; on Birkby's russet side Clouds dropped their quiet shadows; far and wide Scawfell looked forth, beneficently pale; While rooks, at mellow distance, told the tale Of hearts content and hunger satisfied. A soft wind set the thistle dancers free, And, like the ripple of a sunlit stream Running in air, it shook the thousand hues Of leaf to radiance: it was hard to chooseâ The forest waking from a golden dream, The dreamless slumber of the silver sea. VIII. AT MUNCASTER, AFTER THE GALE OF DECEMBER 11, 1883. Wild was the wind, which, out of darkness borne, From that dread West of evil and of death, Broke on your royal pines, and with fierce breath Blasted the life of centuries. Forlorn, The squirrel wakened to a bitter morn; The rookery clanged unresting; and beneath, The shy stag browsed in wonder, with the wreath Of Christmas ivy hung upon his horn. I grieve not for the pinesâwith faithfulness Their masts may bend in many a stout ship set, Outriding Death, triumphant o'er the gale: This is the burden of my vain regret,â Whene'er I wander down the woodland vale, I hear the groans of innocence in distress. IX. THE DEATH OF OLAF THE DANEâ SUNSET BEYOND THE ISLE OF MAN. Full of the Northmen's mission deeds, I strolled Along the beach that looks to Mona's isle, In marvel how the Cross set up by guile Could preach a God of human love, and mould Men into Christ-like shape, or ever hold A dying Saviour on it. Hakon's wile, His pagan, beast's life: Olaf's god-like smile, And brave, untreacherous hands, made answer bold. Then, as of Astrid's warrior child I thought, He took such giant size, that Mona's shore Seemed the Long-Serpent hull Earl Eric fought, And the horizon weltered as with gore; While through the purple waves, with sun for shield, He sank to death, who had not learned to yield. X. HOME FROM THE EAST. AMONG THE DRIGG SAND-HILLS. Who gives his fancy reins to wander free Among the sand-built dunes of Cumbria's coast, Again may follow Israel's flying host By Pihahiroth's sedges and the sea; Or, wrapt in recollection's dream, may be Where Negeb's plain to waves of sand is tost, And hear, by Gaza's ruinâwell-nigh lost Beneath the drifts of desertâGod's decree. He tracks the moon-foot camel in the sand, Hunts in the rushes for the bustling quails, Then tops the bank, and views with glad surprise, O'er Wastdale's plain the brown-backed Screes arise, With Scaw, blue guardian of the sister vales,â And this is home, and this is Cumberland. XI. THE LIGHT-SHIP, SEEN FROM SEASCALE. Scarce has the sun, in rosy-jewelled might, Sunk, when thy double gems with sweet surprise Spring from the dusky waters, and the eyes Of mariners bless thee all the weary night. Oh, never stars in heaven with more delight Were hailed, than these wave-risen! Lo, outflies A roseate gleam and into darkness dies, Then, thro' the tempest, flashes into white. So, heart, must thou, in dangerous waters set, Flash from the lamp of truth its many hues, With pause alternate, thro' the trembling darkâ Thy light, such light as care-worn faces, wet With sad salt water, cannot fail but choose To steer by, when for home they sail their bark. XII. THE DRUID STONE NEAR MILLBECK, SEASCALE. Thy lips are dumb, thy sisters in the grave, But thou, sole witness of a god unknownâ Dercetis, Bel, or Dagonâstill dost own Possession of the secrets that we crave. To thee the fisher sought, and huntsman brave, When moorlands heard the horn at sunrise blown; By thee, when Mona's altar fires were shown, The lamp was lit that flashed on yonder wave. If Seascale's copse and oaks of Drigg have waned, And pearls no longer at thy feet are laid, From Esk and Duddon by the votary brought; Still to thy stone of help is reverence chained, With sense of lonely watching, and the thought Of silent faithâhere vows anew are made. XIII. BRAVE SAILING. As When the sailor by the Cumbrian strand, Worn by the equinox, looks out and sees, Betwixt Black Combe and russet-red Saint Bees, The restful harvest yellow on the land, And almost would his keel had smote the sand So, by the wall of Wastdale's purple screes, His life might share the ploughman's life of easeâ Yet hoises sail, nor bates of heart nor hand; I too, when tossing in the weary strife, The storm of party, hurricane of creed, Look forth for any tempting haven near, And almost wish, by wreck from service freed, A simple shepherd's comfortable lifeâ But still out seaward to the wind I steer. XIV. AT SEASCALE. Here, as we walk along the quilted shore, Dusted with diamond, rich with shell's inlay, We watch the fringe of foam, that far away Broiders the hem old ocean ever wore, Remade each moment, lovelier than before: So gold the grassy banks at shut of day, 'Twixt red Saint Bees and Black Combe, sailors say Grey Cumbria's coast is barred with molten ore. But not the salt sea broidery, nor the beach Purpled by shifting light, with murmur loud, Enchants him most who wanders wrapt in thought; But, as he hears the ocean's marvellous speech And sees in mirrors wet the flying cloud, Heaven's wings, Heaven's voices, nearer him are brought. XV. THE PREACHER'S SEASIDE LESSON. Thou art the prophets' tutor; day by day, Thy voice, wind-driven, sounds along the beach, Whether it hear or hearken not. Thy speech Is true, for everlasting: thou dost say Things brought from depths and distance far away; And, lest thy rhythmic utterance fail to reach Deaf ears, successive sentences shall preach, Line upon line, rolled inward to the bay. Judgment and death may be thy parable, But life and light spring ever from thy grave, And worship;ârapturous clapping of thy hands In praise of Him who painted every shell, Who called leviathan to ride the wave, And laid thy limit on the fearless sands. XVI. THE OLD WRECK AT SEASCALE. Weighed down, in utter helplessness it lies, Whose buoyant youth was lighter than the wave; Each storm, the robber-winds unseal its grave And of its bones would fain make merchandise. Led by the moon, sea-waters sympathise; E'en hands that snatch, some sense of pity have; Deeper in sand each dayâthe boon they craveâ Its sorrows sink from out the seaman's eyes. So may it be when storms my life shall strand On treachery's shoal or disappointment's reef: May the same tide that drove my hull to land Break up my being far beyond relief; And waves, that wrecked, reach out a pitying hand To gulf my sorrow, and to hide my grief. XVII. THE IRISH LAND LEAGUE. OCTOBER 17, 1881. As one, new-come from a secluded vale, Lies down to rest beside the wakeful deep, But troubled with its trouble cannot sleep For cries of sailors sounding in the gale, And hears the cruel ocean's harrowing tale Told to a land it threatens to o'ersweep, Nor thinks the tide its boundary must keep, That stars still shine and vessels still may sail;â So when I hear the half-articulate cries From Ireland's alien-hearted children, blown Through the dark night of riot, to our shore, I too forget that passion's tide goes down, How cliffs of Justice stem all waves that rise, And Truth steers safe, if stars of Love shine o'er. XVIII. ROCK RUINS AT SEASCALE. Did waves indignant here with storm invest Some castle huge, and straw it on the sand? Or did the Viking rangers of this land, Who bade yon stone tree Yggdrasil attest That Christ, not Balder, was the Captain blest, Build here a ladder huge whereon to stand, Whence all the waves to Mona might be scanned, And every sail be questioned from the west? No answer comes: the stones are hoar and strange, Hairy with weeds, with limpets overgrown; They keep their secret well; tide after tide Their heads beneath the ocean's brim they hide; No storm their dumb confederacy can change, Their call to fancy can no waters drown. XIX. THE GOSFORTH CROSS. We are not wiser than the seers of old, Our Fathers,âthey, twelve hundred years agone, Hewed from its silent place this prophet-stone, And bade the sacred Yggdrasil uphold A Balder-Christ, whose triumphs should be told In pagan picture:âhere the battle won By Horn's blast,âthere the Horse with Death thereon Cast down for years whose coil is endless rolled. Preacher of Christ, stone-lipped, but not in vain: Preacher of woman's love to help her Lord By faithful tendance, yea, though earth should quake: For, lo! her feet upon the bruised snake, Here Mary stands beside her Son in pain; There Loki's queen prevents the poison poured. XX. SEASCALE MEMORIES. As if the salt-sea-blood that years ago Won the fore-elder Vikings Cumberland, Leapt in their veins, the glad, tumultuous band Sped to the shore, and gleaming, to and fro The bathers hurried; some, more grave, would know What treasures lay upon the generous sand, And here and there the lover with his hand Would trace a name the waves should hide at flow. Ah, happy feet; this fresh, unwrinkled shore Forgives all mischief ye shall make in play, And though to-morrow's sun shall find no trace Of all your frolicâtides must rise apace, Sorrow and painâyet to the bitterest core Of life's drear sands, shall sink the memory of to-day. XXI. THE PEACE OF UNDERSTANDING. Here, as I watch the ceaseless ebb and flow Of these successive threateners of the land, Spending their powers in vain, I understand A little of the secret Peace must know; Peace that o'erlooks all storms, feeling, below, Her feet are firm upon His high command Who set the ocean swinging, in Whose hand The great moon-weights move steady to and fro. The fierce sea-chargers, even as they curve Their necks sink foam-flecked on their knees foredone, So pride o'er-reaching falls before the goal: And those battalions coming bravely on, Shout though they may, they cannot shake the nerve Of him who knows how far the waves may roll. XXII. ARCHBISHOP GRINDAL, FOUNDER OF SAINT BEES GRAMMAR SCHOOL 1587. No wonder, nursed in such a breezy home, Betwixt the rosy headland in the west And Cumbria's treeless wild, that to thy breast Great thoughts, and free as ocean air, should come. Thou saw'st heaven's light beyond the darkening foam That held thee exile, and didst well attest How God can crown a life, though dispossessed Of royal favour and the smiles of Rome. Still may we hear from courtly Spenser's lips Of Algrind's life, the gentle and the wise, And they who pass Saint Bega's shrine may name Thee, bold for conscience' sake to welcome shame, Thee with thine ample forehead, those mild eyes That outfaced queens and suffered sad eclipse. XXIII. TOMB OF THOMAS DE COTTINGHAM, OBIIT 1300. SAINT BEES. Stubborn of mouth, and with a stony eye, Hands firm in prayer, full-robed with monkish gown, Well wears he cowl severe, and tonsure crown Who now from stone beholds the passers by: Great Thomas, he of Cottingham, might die, The cloisters fall, the walls be overthrown, But century after century still should own How Brother Thomas ruled his Priory. Rude were the times for mitre, cowl, or cope, And rough the ways in rugged Cumberland; The road to Heaven is not more easy now. Still must we labour on, and die in hope, In his heart's cell must each still take the vow, And still in prayer true hand be pressed to hand. XXIV. BEOWULF'S STONE, SAINT BEES. MAMMON WORSHIP REBUKED. Here, where the Cross is set, the red alcove No longer echoes with the call to sales; Men leaving Church no longer talk of bales, And tax, and cess: their eyes are drawn above To where a dragon warrior, and dove Speak of a beast fierce-mouthed, with bristling scales, Whose passionate greed prevailed and still prevails, With whom this age must strive as others strove. Thrice happy change that they who here profess The Christ who preached down pelf, the Christ men sold, Should see in runes the trouble of our time, And feel each Sabbath, when the Church bells chime, How well the Cross and sacred dove express The warrior's hope against the beast of gold. XXV. THE SNOW MIRACLE, A LEGEND OF SAINT BEES. Go, Lady, ask Lord Lucy of his grace To grant us land, so did Saint Bega say, Where we may rear a house to watch and pray: The storm that flung us to the landing-place Robbed us of all. Lord Lucy from the chase Came laughing home: Good dame, I answer, Nay, Yet promise all on next Midsummer day Is white with snow to mend the stranger's case. God hath His book, St. Bega's prayer is won, Vows made in haste are vows eternally: There came the hallow-eve of Great Saint John, Forth looked the young moon from a sultry sky; But ere the night to Midsummer had gone, Beneath the snow three miles of seaboard lie. XXVI. THE FORESTER'S. TOMB, SAINT BEES. Nameless the tomb, his forest-deeds unsung, But this rude scrawl upon his monument, Drawn as a child would draw, is eloquent; For there he stands, his huntsman's bow well-strung, And overhead, the quarrel-pouch up-hung Which round his girth was worn when forth he went To hunt for venison in the woods of Dent, Or rob the Sanwith she-wolf of her young. Ah, since that day of hound and hawk and hood, Which this stout archer of the Priory knew, A blight has fallen upon Saint Bega's land; The rooks can scarcely find a nesting wood, The steam-mills hoot where once the horn he blew, And men are slaves in coaly Cumberland. XXVII. SAINT BEES. Saint bega's Church peeps out behind the hill; Laid out upon the treeless upland wide, No longer needs the village now to hide; Rotun the rover chief is dead, but still As if it feared the ocean's treacherous will It rests inland, and yetâthe plowman's prideâ Those long-drawn fallows stretch toward the tide, And sea-mews toss and tumble round his drill. Here twice a day the sea-lips, deadly pale, Are touched to life beyond the tawny cove, And that old wizard scatters coraline, Jacinth and onyx, then his pulses fail, And, while the beach grows blank and grey above, Long miles of liquid pearl, the wet sands shine. XXVIII. SEA-COTE, SAINT BEES. Above the grey-blue beach and yellow sand Is set a milk-white hostelry apart, Simple without, within of simple heart And simple fare and hospitable hand. To morning sun and evening twilight stand Its portals openâgroan of wain or cart Comes seldom, round its eaves the swallows dart, No noise disturbs the work their loves have planned. Here oft the sea-bird's unfamiliar cry Is borne to him who dreams upon his bed, Hushed into slumber by the ocean's sound; And when the sun beyond dark Tomline's head Has set aflame the sea and the wide sky, Here rest is sure, and healthful sleep is found. XXIX. SEA-GULLS AT SAINT BEES. Moveless of wing, as if by spell suspended, About the ledges where their eggs are laid The sea-mews hung, of no alarms afraid, So well had height and depth their homes defended. Yet with a wailing that was never ended Far out to sea was lamentation made, And, trembling up the cliffs, shade after shade Like ghosts in grief ascended and descended. It seemed as if the cries of all the pain The travailing earth has felt, were there expressed; The tortured rocks were vocal with dismay: As if all storms that ever wracked the main Were finding utterance in the sea-bird's breast, And sudden sorrow had possessed the bay. XXX. THE LARK ON TOMLINE HEAD. To sit and listen where two voices meet, One the continual patter of the stream, And one old ocean's murmurings, that seem, Pause after pause, one utterance to repeat As if for exhortation,âthat were sweet, While round the emerald beetles shoot and gleam, Brown martlets cry, and lazy cattle dream, And the curved beach is winking in the heat. But, tireless minstrel, neither voice prevails When thou dost singâthe giant, laid to sleep Far up the valley, heard thy tender pleas And wondering looked to heaven, while she the gales Drove hither, in thy joy, forgot the deep And all its perilsâAbbess of Saint Bees. XXXI. A DOUBTFUL MAY. TOMLINE HEAD, SAINT BEES. The thrift's rose-jewelled caskets in the wind To fainter flowers each day are shaking free, The larks are loud on Tomline Head for glee, And eager school-boys down in Fleswick find Rare primrose tufts, with violets, the pale kind That take their colour from Saint Mona's sea: With dazzling gold the gorse makes gay the lea, The fragrant breezes have a May-day mind. Inland o'er treeless wastes the cuckoo calls, The new-sown fields are red from sky to sky, But eastward, Skiddaw, like a winter ghost, Gleams snowy cold, and hark! with bitter cry The nesting mews upon the seaward wall Wail, as if May and all spring hopes were lost. XII.Wrongly numbered in the source text; should be poem XXXII. MUSIC OF TWO WORLDS, SAINT BEES HEAD. Oh wild wave-people, whose far-wandering breasts Are white from miles of breaker, leagues of foam, Here do ye well to build your fortress home, For here the strange sea-murmur never rests. Ever towards the cliff's gorse-gilded crests Through tufts of thrift the hollow sounds will come, So that your fledglings, wheresoe'er they roam, Can ne'er forget the music of your nests. Thrice happy birds, for, ere their wings shall grow, Your children will have heard upon the steep The best of sounds our sad old earth can give, Song of the lark and distant cattle's low; So wandering over songless seas shall live As those whose souls two worlds of music keep. XXXIII. THE IMPERISHABLE GOSPEL. A LEGEND OF THE SOLWAY. When, close behind, the Danish robbers cried, And Lorton's lap no longer gave them rest, They bore Saint Cuthbert's body to the west, And fain beyond the wave their trust would hide; Against the vessel rose a sea, whose tide Rolled back the Saint with blood, as if its breast Were wounded to the heart, and all confessed At Derwent's mouth the body must abide. With loss it rose, with gain the tide sank low; The monks who sought their Gospel of the Lord, Wave-washed from out the ship, found whole and fair The jewelled gift of Eadfrid: storms may throw Such jewels overboard, but God will care, And lo, with added salt, regives His Word. XXXIV. THE GLADNESS OF THE SEA. League after league of sunshine, and a face As changeful as a lover's, in what love The sea for tryst comes dancing up the cove; How light of heart, with what excess of grace, Does wave on wave its brother shoreward race! Thrice happy ocean, where thy waters move Is health, and life, and hope for keels that rove, Thou bearest home brave ships in thine embrace. Thou seem'st to hold thy breath, then, laughing, roll Up the long beach in roar of merriment, And while the dolphins sport in happy shoal Far seaward, and glad cries of children sent Ring from the shore, thy tide has touched my soul, And I am glad with thy deep-drawn content.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK VI. SONNETS OF THE NORTH-EAST COAST. I. ON SHINING SANDS. When I lament how many seem to go Blurring the heaven reflected at their feet, Unthinking that the upward gaze is sweet, Not daring, oceanwards, to breast the blow Of those long crashing walls of falling snow, And, out beyond, the hurricance to meet, Their blind lives ventureless and incomplete Because so little of the world they know,â A voice makes answer, You, who breast the foam And look into the face of heaven, forget The downcast hearts, sad eyes, and feebler hands: For these the shores in glory shining wet Make life's dull level seem an Angel's home; These find their rainbows on the foam-wreathed sands. II. GEORGE WISHART, MARTYRED AT SAINT ANDREWS, MARCH 1, 1545. Deep in the Castle donjon by the sea He heard the waves with intermittent shock Boomâand the winds his misery seemed to mock With voice of freedomâbut his soul was free. He knew false Peter held the prison key, And one lie told, his fetters would unlock: Willing he stood, self-shut within the rock, And from that rock he drank perpetually, Rock-natured grown. But since by that stern road Of hissing faggot and slow shrivelling flame Alone could fullest liberty be won, Whilst the grim Cardinal looked moveless on, He bore the Cross, contemptuous of the shame, And passed through fire and tempest straight to God. IV. ON READING, AFTER HIS DEATH, PRINCIPAL SHAIRP'S LAST PUBLIC LECTURE ON HOGG, THE ETTRICK SHEPHERD. King of the half-forgotten world of fays, When Mab was queen among the Elfin band A blight has fallen upon our northern land, No Brownies dance down Ettrick's forest braes, Where Douglas runs to Yarrow, but thy praise Lives through his lips who well could understand How Nature into flame thy fancy fanned, And drank thy full imagination's rays. No more on Hawkshaw Rig the shepherd's son Weaves, to the murmur of melodious streams, What tales he learned beside his mother's knee, But somewhere on a lily-blossomed lea, He leads the pure Kilmeny gently on, And finds another friend to share his dreams. VI. ON THE LINKS, SAINT ANDREWS. Nerves at full stretch, with cool considerate hand, The golfer strikes, away the white ball flies, And lost to sight, for all but practised eyes, Scatters the dew, or runs along the sand. Now by nice care, and choice of weighted wand, Mid language strange, âcliquesâ âbunkersâ âputsâ and âtries,â The ball, that flew, creeps on, and halting, dies: Dropped to the tomb towards which its course was planned. Another course there is, with diverse goals, Two walk those Links, and neither are agreed: Love with its angel wish to help and save, Hate with desire to harm the woman's seed: And o'er life's hill and hollow speed our souls, By foe and friend close-followed to the grave. VII. TO M. K. ON HER EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY. SAINT ANDREWS. Dear girl, of all the shells to-morrow's tide Shall from the bounteous ocean cast ashore, Though each some sweet congratulation bore, One shell must needs be added, one beside All others to be cherished! It will hide Within its whispering-gallery at the core A jewel for thine ear; sought out the more, Lest oceanwards ungathered it may slide For Aphrodite's keeping. Happy girl, Upon whose brow the eighteenth March has set Grace and sweet bloom, be wise, the god of Love Works even of friendship sorrow. Pure the pearl I offer for your birthday coronet: Pearl is but pain with rainbow overwove. VIII. FAREWELL TO SAINT ANDREWS. Farewell, thou city of the thousand years, High o'er the reefs the Achaian sailors knew, And Acca with his bold Northumbrian crew Made famous. Strong sea-music in thine ears Works its continual charm, and still thy seers From thought's high cliff the storms of doubt may view, And guide to safety. Still in royal hue, Though kings are past, young scholarhood appears. Shades haunt theeâbishops, kings, one fair queen's face, Protesting martyr, Rome's fierce Cardinal, And that stern Preacher, he who shook thy towers And broke thine altars; great amongst them all, Those pillars of thine Academic bowers, Gracious in wisdom oneâone wise in grace. IX. BAMBOROUGH CASTLE. High on its rock the ruddy castle glowed, Like some huge monster, crawled from out the seas, The isles of Farne, Northumbria's Cyclades, Broke the blue tide that toward the fortress flowed; Thither his forty keels bold Ida rowed, There Aidan bent the saintliest of knees, And Oswald's hand, that heard the beggar's pleas And could not taste corruption, alms bestowed. No saints seek refuge now, no warriors come, Thy use is gone, thou tower-encircled steepâ But like the spring of Bebban's basalt well Thou dost renew thy strength; thy citadel Is garrisoned with girls who learn to keep By arts of peace the inviolable home. X. GRACE DARLING. She lies beneath her canopy of stone, No sun comes nigh her now, nor any star, But that tower-beacon, where the islets are, Guards well her memory and the brave deeds done. And still the oar by which her fight was won Rests in her hand, and though the salt winds scar Her face, and bruise her sleep, that tale of war 'Twixt soul and wave triumphantly goes on. Land of the island warrior, since the day That Saxon Ida and his forty prows Brought force and passion and the sea-king's pride To climb yon castle rock, this little bay Has seen how deeds of battle fade, and knows How only thoughts of mercy can abide. XI. AT ALNMOUTH. Not for the dead, not for the dead, O Lord, But for the living ever in Thy sight, The souls made perfect in the perfect light, Whose hands are ever on truth's keenest sword, For these we sorrow, and in full accord Aln, as she winds from Percy's castled height, Makes moan, yet runs unlingering to the bight By yonder mound, where dead men's bones are stored. But in this amphitheatre of green There is such mimic gladiatorial show, The net, the ball, the golf-club blow on blow, That Aln runs back and brims her banks between: Life, thoughtless life, as innocent as gay, Has such strong power to charm, she needs must stay. XII. WARKWORTH CASTLE HILL. Here, like a shy sad lover, comes the sea And strives in vain to circle round thy waist, Thou haughty hill, as proud as thou art chaste, But still abashed must leave thee fancy-free. Then when the rains have soaked the moorland lea, The river woos thee, thou art nigh embraced By one who knows the girdle to thy taste And offers liquid gold for silver fee. But never yet has that tower-circled brow Stooped to be kissed of river or of wave; Thou art unfettered as the winds that rave, And, such a sense of freedom thou hast won, That even Fitzpatrick's bastions are laid low To let thee kiss the stars and woo the sun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK VII. Part I SONNETS OF THE YORKSHIRE COASTâSALTBURN. I. A CHILD'S FACE ON THE SHORE. Down to a quiet sea the shores incline, So smoothed from sorrow, and so swept from care, A maiden's foot could scarce in trespass dare To print thereon her solitary sign; But yesterday its brow was line on line Scored deep, and aged,âto-day so young and fair; Yet waves that wrought the wondrous change up-bare Shells closely shut, and jelly-fish that shine. I could not grieve to think the tide of years, Of pain and passion's heavy gall, should mar Thine innocent, unmeditative face: Furrows for thought, and channelling for tears, Can of the hand that works them borrow grace, Secrets like shells, and patience like a star. II. CLEVELAND. How free and fair the land from Esk to Tees, Where Gower grew great, and Roger Ascham strolled, Where that old Bible-rhymer, cloistered, told His Saxon tale to sound of Whitby seas. Fragrant of salt, the sunny upland lees To purple moors, by lines of hedge, are rolled; The corn, plates all the seaward cliffs with gold, And deep in streamlet hollows hide the trees. Three harvests bless the labourer: fisher-sails Hunt through the gleaming night the silver droves; And though great Vulcan's stithy sweats and rings, And men have bruised the hills and mined the coves, Still by his long-backed farm the thatcher sings, And in the barn is heard the sound of flails. III. A NAMELESS GRAVE AT MARSKE. âHis father lies at Marske without a name,â So runs the doggerel; but the hero son Name to the worldâfor that old father won Memorial, and an honourable fame. Nor shalt thou be forgotten, honest dame; When sheep were folded and the work was done, Thou bad'st the boy spell letters one by one, And by that gift a thirst of travel came, With power to quench it. High on Easby Hill, The shepherd-sailor's deed of worth is told, And Yorkshire honours her Columbus brave; But, long as Cleveland breeds sea-captains bold, Shall Martin's school-dame be remembered still, And love seek out the nameless father's grave. IV. THE HUNTCLIFF. What weird Protean changefulness impressed Yon cliff, when layer on layer up it rose Above the Saurian, in his fossil woes, That thus all day, as if it could not rest Content in one same royal purple dressed, It needs must don such amethystine shows, And, like a breathing thing that feels, disclose Chameleon changes upward to its crest? Was it infected by the sapphire tide That crawls in colour, restless, manifold, Above the yellow seaweed at its feet; Or, does the world of shadows here compete With lustrous sunshine, so that they, who hold Light only loved, feel darkness glorified? V. BENEATH HUNTCLIFF. I sat amongst the old world's oldest dead, In halls sepulchral, rifled by the tide; The horns and bolts of Ammon at my side Peeped from the pitch-dark clay, and overhead, Line upon line, were stored in earth, blood-red, The showers of sling-stones, telling how for pride, By wrath of Zeus, the huge sea-monsters died, Who crawled like toads, but wore the gavial's head. So well had Time, the sexton, covered o'er The tale of death with reverential hand, No human eye had known such secrets lurk Within earth's charnel, but for waves who work Uninterrupted by the moaning shore, To dig the grave of all that burial land. VI. THE PIER AT SALTBURN-BY-THE-SEA. Our lives are like this many-footed thing: We strain out seaward, but ashore we stand, Caught by the foot, and sinking deep in sand; And ever and anon a snow-white wing Gleams past, to sadden us. We fain would spring To follow. Airs from Heaven, about us fanned, Move us no more; but some discordant band May play and please, while fools in motley sing. Ah! well for us, if but a little way Some child or agÃ¨d man we safely bear Upon our shoulders o'er the flowing sea; And happy, if by us, one seems to be Pacing a steady deck, without a fear, Out toward the deeps, beyond our prison bay. VII. THE GARDENS, SALTBURN-BY-THE-SEA. I know a happy vale wherein the sea Throbs audibly, and silver waters wait The fall of tide to pass beyond its gate; Charmed by sweet sound of magic minstrelsy, By quaint inlay, and such flower-jewelry As well befits the summer's royal state, The streamlet halts, to hear grey-beards debate, Or runs with happy children, racing free. On cool cropped sward and labyrinthine walk, There meditation seeks the hanging wood; And, when with wild-briar incense groves are sweet, May fancy haunt again the hushed retreat Of holy friar, and hear the ghostly talk Of Whitby's hermit in his cowl and hood. VIII. THE GARDENS ILLUMINATED, SALTBURN-BY-THE-SEA. In old romances of Arabian night, And wondrous tale of Eastern fantasies, There were no hanging gardens like to these, Such ecstasy of innocent delight. Like Kama's lamps the earth-born stars are bright, A firefly glamour haunts the dusky trees, The dark parterres shine out in jewelries, And dancing lantern-shades bewilder sight. Flame-flowers are blossomingâamber, green, and rose, In brake and bush bewitching colours gleam, Here a white moon casts shadow, there a sun Of deepest crimson rises, wanes, and grows, Then dies; while on we walk entranced, and dream Of worlds where only fancy's feet may run. IX. THE GARDENS BY MOONLIGHT. Once more, by dim Mediterranean seas, I feel the breath of flowers, and move in dream Thro' drowsy olives down toward a stream That, swollen by moonlight's generous increase, By some old castle slips to shores of peace, Where ocean whispers. Sudden, lo! a gleam Of torches; hark! far melodies that seem To float and die along the wondering breeze. By terraced slopes I go, where steps descending Lead to a temple whiter than the moon, Through darkened avenues, with alcoves fit For holy lovers; while, by gay lamps lit, O'erhanging boughs are silvered, each leaf bending In time to that enchanted valley's tune. X. THE SALTBURN VIADUCT. If they whose brick-built terraces decay Beneath the mountainous waste of Babylon, Could leave their dusty graves, to gaze upon This vale's gigantic piers of rosy clay; And with them stood the men who through the day Of Baalbec's heat gave up their flesh and bone, Yet in the quarry left the fourth great stone, The wide earth's marvel and their own dismay,â How would they sigh to think their sweat was given To magnify a crazed, ambitious king, Or make a world of brutish wonder stare,â While these, with honest hands for bread have striven, To build their arch of triumph high in air, And speed the cars of peace on swifter wing. XI. AT MARSKE MILL. This is the vale and gate of humbleness: Who passes 'neath yon roseate arch's height, He has no need of priest or eremite; Bowed down himself, he owns his littleness, And must his insignificance confess; Yet therewithal will this stupendous sight Strike to the soul a sense of wondrous might, Such power has man his brothers to impress. Thebes bowed before its Memnon, but we kneel Before these ringing arches wrapped in cloud, And hear at times a voice with music sweet, Soft prelude of the roar of fiery feet; We know each vast brick-builded Yggdrasil Speaks with the gods,âthey rush and answer loud. XII. SKELTON, THE BIRTHPLACE OF ROBERT BRUCE'S ANCESTORS. A DREAM OF ROBERT THE BRUCE. Now know I how the heart of Bruce was stored, Which, ere it rested by the banks of Tweed, Flung in the fiercest onset, nerved the deed Of men, who, for its safety, swept the horde Of Saracens like dust before the sword. To him this free wide moorland taught its creed, And those red cliffs would bid him dare to bleed Rather than own the storm of foes his lord. He saw the coastward beacons leap and flareâ Himself unto his land would beacon be. But what strong purpose and persistence do, Twin deep-run streamlets, did he learn of you; For, where the hermit joined his hands in prayer, Ye joined your hands and joyously went free. XIII. THE BELLS OF SKELTON NEW CHURCH TOWER (RUNG FOR THE FIRST TIME, JULY 31, 1884.). The bells chimed loud, the ringers rang with will; Six voices cried, âCome! for I call you now.â From high Upleatham's wood to Warsett brow, From Huntcliff Nab to ancient Brotton hill, The clear notes clanged. The miller, at his mill, Heard strange airs quivering round him, far below; And sailors, leaning on the weather bow, Caught sounds that seemed all Saltburn's bay to fill With wild sea music. Still the bells were swungâ The strong tower shook, and tremblingly the vane Moved, as, for joy, the very earth were stirred. That evening village babes, in dreamland, heard Angels from Heaven, and Cleveland's hollow plain Found for the worthiest news a worthy tongue. XIV. AT SKELTON OLD CHURCH. We leave the church, where weekly prayer was said, Ringed round with graves and fenced with elm and yew; Praise in a fairer shrine shall men renew, Vows at a nobler altar shall be made; Unheeded now the mossy dial's shade, No preacher climbs three stories high to view The village magnate in his musty pew, And Georgian galleries to dust shall fade. White gleams the tower beyond the village street, And proud and loud ring out the lustier chimes; But some heart-flowers, transplanted, ne'er can grow: These old church grasses still shall feel the feet Of those, who hear the bells of other times, And seek the holiest spot on earth they know. XV. AT GUISBOROUGH ABBEY. Who stand by Guisborough's ruin find revealed No abbey window, but an open door With sight of distant wood and purple moor, Through which, with shouts of some historic field, Come belted squire, and knight with lance and shield, Great dames, proud abbots, bowing o'er the floor Of level sward; but One, for all men poor, Waits in the shadow, and his lips are sealed. Then down the naveânow roofed with purer heavenâ Through innocent flowers that fitly praise their God, By aisles with grasses hushed in reverence, Silent and sad He moves; to Him is given A scourge of cords and an avenging rod: He drives the world's religious robbers hence. XVI. ROSEBERRY TOPPING. (OSNABURGH OR WODENSBURGH.) Since high enthroned on Ida's fateful plain Sat Odin, when the Northmen hither roved They chose this throne-like hill for him they loved,â Here o'er Valhalla should the great god reign; Hard by ran Mimir's fountain, whither, fain To know if Heimdal's warning could be proved, When Asgard trembled and the earth was moved By RagnarÃ¶k, went Odin, but in vain. Fountain of sorrow, hill-top dark with fate, The cloud pavilions reared upon thine height, The stars that tremble o'er thee, speak of woe; Yet this of solace have we, that we know Neither the day we shall be desolate, Nor that dread hour when o'er us falls the night. XVII. FROM WARSETT BROW. Warm was the air, and on the salt sea wind Floated the gift of fruit to upland corn; From Fleeborough Hill to Roseberry, was borne The same sure message of the Eternal Mindâ That whoso ploughs with honest sweat shall find His pearls among the fallows. Then a horn Hooted. I stood on Warsett Brow forlorn; The woods were blighted and the pastures pined. Like clustered giants, looking through fierce breath And glaring hotly with wild jealous eyes, Between the Vale of Saltburn and the Tees Stood up the workers of the great plain's death; Plutonic labour cursed the sunset skies, And Cyclops' stithy smoke perplexed the seas. XVIII. THE ENCHANTED CASTLE BETWEEN SALTBURN AND WHITBY. When rockcliffe's walls are reddening with the eve, And Staithes' bold fishers steer toward the night, A stately castle on a foreland height Rises with towers and bastions make-believe: Then, round their cabin fires the sailors weave Tales of the haunted hold that no sea-fight Could storm; for back to stone, before men's sight, The cliffs those fairy ramparts would receive. Along the sea-board of our lives there stand Gaunt castles, phantom forts of empty show, Once garrisoned with thought, now turned to stone; But not the magic evening's after-glow Can break the charm and bid the towers be manned: The seas roar dark beneath, âHope, hope is gone!â Part II. SONNETS OF THE YORKSHIRE COAST-RUNSWICK BAY. I. THE WARRIOR'S CRADLE-SONG. Bright in the moon-washed heaven the Charioteer Hangs, and Orion listens wide-awake; Continuous rolled, without a pause or break The plunging surge from cape to cape I hear; Bells clang, clash cymbals, horses prance and rear, Now with a crowd's acclaim whole cities shake, Now hosts, in ambush laid, hoarse whisperings make, Anon the cannon shout and armies cheer. I could not wonder that the men who sleep Lulled into dreams or woke by sounds like these, Should feel ambition in their souls had birth, Should cross for fame the wild applauding seas, With noise of arms should climb the imperial steep And thunder at the shores of half the earth. II. CAPTAIN COOK: BOYHOOD AT STAITHES. No longer need these fisher huts go hide; For here, when weary of the weights and scales, The boy, whose heart was winged with ocean sails, Clomb wondering up by Rockcliffe's grassy side And watched the setting sun, in golden pride, Write on the trembling sea persuasive tales Of undiscovered lands, and merchant bales Waiting for barques to push through seas untried. But most the moon, which holds in withered hands Those swaying scales whose weights are ocean streams, Filled his imagination, as she made The shore white seas with continents of shade; For there, by chart upon the shining sands, He sailed world round in his adventurous dreams. III. AT STAITHES. Hid in their tawny cleft, the fisher clan, Untravelled, seldom climbing to the moor, With the wild ocean knocking at their door, Wage the same war their forefathers began; Build the same boats; the same nets weave and tan Eat the same bread, salt-savoured, and are poor; Content in hopeless labour to endure, Till death shall find for them a nobler plan. But some there are, adventurous souls, who feel Fresh inspiration from their prison bars; And, stirred by narrow confines such as these, Go forth to plant beneath their roving keel This solid earth, this canopy of stars, And bring back word of the Antipodes. IV. STAITHES BECK. Fenced from the world by cliffs, whereon the kale Sucks opal from the redolent sea air, One way alone the people have to fare, Closed oft against them by the treach'rous gale. And one rough sea the folk must ever sailâ The sea of household industry and careâ Whether the boys weave nets or the girls bear High on their heads, from far, the brimming pail. Yet still no beck between the Esk and Tees Runs half so serviceably to the tide, With such accompaniments of laugh and play, As Staithes, thy stream, where good wives on their knees, While children splash or mimic at their side, Wash the sea-stains of labour quite away. V. HINDERWELL. Here in God's Acre since Saint Hilda first Drank at this spring and set the Cross hard by, The village, century after century, Has come to quench at morn and eve its thirst; And he who drinks not of it is accursed In barn and field, he cannot sell nor buy; Nor ever has this fountain head run dry, Since from the rock the spring baptismal burst. And here when lips no more cool water crave They bring the dead for rest beside the well, And they who through the long day's heat had come Light-handed and returned with burden home, Come hither weary laden, and may tell How grief can drink of hope beside a grave. VI. AT RUNSWICK. If ever tired Ulysses by this shore, On such a day, above the laughing foam, Had seen these dwellings clustered, thoughts of home Had bade him sail the wine-dark seas no more; Yon cape, with sunset colour powdered o'er, Had been to him Leucimne: thither come, He would have vowed such vows as men who roam Vow safe-returned, and hung to Zeus an oar. Thereafter, as he strolled, the dark-lipped caves For him should have been full of oracle; And, dreaming haply of the Chersonese, The sea would, in compassion, cease to swell, And gorgeous seaweeds, from beneath the waves, Would float, as here, in wealth of golden fleece. VII. THE FISHER HOUSES AT RUNSWICK BAY. Two hundred years have scarce repaired the wrong Done by the hungry waves that still devour, And all who fled that dark disastrous hour Are safe, beyond earth's crumbling. How the throng Of red-roofed houses, that have climbed along Their golden cliff, peep forth from apple bower Brave as the fisher girls in calm, or cower Silent as fisher folk when storms are strong. Like gay-cloaked gossips stand they knot by knot, Shoulder to shoulder, and, from every hearth, Rises as one the smoke that seamen hail; Steep are the ledgy steps from cot to cot, Love crowns each height, there is no place on earth So dear to those who in the offing sail. VIII. A RETROSPECT. OFF TO THE FISHING-GROUND, RUNSWICK. With stout storm-jacket o'er their shoulders cast, Their food sealed safe against the waves in hand, Bravely they turned toward the barren strand, Forgetful of the misadventures past; Down to the shore the children hurried fast. Knee-deep, the sturdy three on breakers stand, Push at the boatâshe quiversâleaves the sand, And soon the brown sail bellies from the mast. The sun dropped down; far off, the fishers knew The smother on the darkening cliff to be The breath of fires that warmed the household meal; And all night long, that cloud was clear in view, Though every boat had dropped behind the sea, And herring-moonlight flashed about each keel. IX. KETTLENESS AND HOB HOLE. We drank the villagers' unfailing spring, And as from hollow stone to stone we stepped, We knew that generations here had left Mark of the labourers' thirst at evening. Thence turned we to the slopes of fern and ling, Dappled with seamew wings, and overswept With noises of the sea, and in the cleft Saw that dark cave where Hob found sheltering. Good fellow, Robin, though the days are drear, And men have set their fancy all on gold, Still can the fisher-children dream; and yet Thy name among the seekers after jet Is household word, the shepherds, far and near, Can bless or curse thee for their luck a-fold. X. THE GIANT OF MULGRAVE DALE. Between the streams that die into the sand Of that long Bay old Ptolemy knew well, Lies the green ridge of Wada's citadel; Wada, the giant duke, whose bloody hand Smote Ethelred the King; Wada, who plann'd The causeway straight o'er hill and pathless fell; Who, from the apron of his consort Bell, Spilt heaps of stone, the marvel of the land. But now a mightier giant rules the vale, Throws the dark shade of his imperious sway Across the stream, the roofs, the ricks of corn; And, when grim Wada's walls have passed away, This giant's steed shall plunge thro' miles of shale, And Mulgrave's woods shall hear his steamy horn. XI. PATRIOTISM. IN MULGRAVE WOODS. Down this deep wood, along the murmuring stream Caedmon the shepherd rhymer may have strayed, Grave Gower have sadly gone from sun to shade, And told young Chaucer how the daisies' gleam And the merle's voice could make a wise man dream. Perchance the teacher of that queenly maid Who saved our England, here to heart had laid How worth the saving England's shores could seem. Fit school for all such scholars, still the wood Is green, flowers bloom, and still the sweet birds call, And still for thoughtful feet the pathway winds. Cold patriot he, and but of barren mood, Who joins such woodland company and finds No heart to strike for England ere she fall. XII. TO AND FROM MULGRAVE CASTLE. When, from the roll of breakers and the sound Of that great sea the murderer Maulac heard, I seek the woods where once his name was feared, And gain his fortress castleâbut a mound Of crumbling buttress, sentinelled around With innocent dumb treesâmy pulse is stirred By the least flutter of a startled bird, So well has deathless awe possessed the ground. But, Ocean, haply wand'ring back to thee, By either deep-embosomed woody stream, To cottage roofs and gardens gay with flowers, Fierce Maulac's deed would vanish like a dream, But for thy presence, double-hearted sea, Hiding beneath thy cloak such cruel powers. XIII. THE MULGRAVE STREAM. You ask me why o'er bridges to and fro Across the stream, by banks of fern and shale, I still must haunt green Mulgrave's woody vale, Where Caedmon wandered centuries agoâ It is because the solemnest sounds that flow By constant utterance, of their awe must fail, That still the sweetest oft-recurrent tale Palls on the heart that has refused to know. But here the streamlet runs, not ever clear, As if it hid the meaning of its tone, And whether men will have it yea or nay, Behold, it murmurs, Earth shall melt away, Thought and sincerest song abide alone, Be true and think and sing and have no fear. Part III. SONNETS OF THE YORKSHIRE COASTâWHITBY. I. THE SORROW OF THE SEA. Hast thou a ceaseless woe that cannot swoon, Or in thy central depths, some bitter ache Vexing thy heart and keeping thee awake, That I, by thine unquiet roused too soon, Must walk thy headlands, spelling out the rune, The scripture that thy flowing foam-wreaths make, Whilst wild with grief thy body seems to shake And heaves responsive to the sorrowing moon? Each month thou reachest to the shore a hand For sympathetic touch, each month in vain Descendest to thyself to seek for cure, But learnest ever how the pitiless land Repels thy plea, and grudges all thy gain, And how hearts inconsolable endure. II. WHITBY. Fort of the Bay, for so the Saxons named This quiet mouth of Esk, that twice a day Drinks the deep sea and thirstsâthe forts decay And only waves are foes; but that far-famed Maid-offering to warâin stone proclaimed By Oswy and by Reinfridâwhile men pray And church bells ring for Sabbath, still must stay: Saint Hilda lives, albeit her shrine is shamed! And whether sailors climb the steep to prayers, Or run to sight their vessels' gain or loss, Or in among their rose-roof shadows glide Beneath the vapoury cliffâthat Christ has died They know; they feel, though steep Heaven's Altar-stairs, That God's great sign of victory is the Cross. III. SAINT HILDA. Saint Hilda! Abbess she of Streonshald, Prayed, and was pure of heart and pure of hand, And when she walked along the thundering strand The shy cliff doves, wind-beaten, storm-appalled, Dropped to her bosom fearless as she called. Touched by her feet, as by enchanter's wand, The serpents left their heads upon the sand, Coiled into stone, or stiffened as they crawled. Still is the power of pure-souled maids who pray Strong to destroy all venomous things that crawl; Only a look, the serpent shrinks and dies; About their paths, from out of Heaven, will fall Mute things that need love's tend'rest ministries, And in their bosoms frightened doves shall stay. IV. BY THE ESK AT WHITBY. Lives nursed in quiet, where no cares intrude, 'Mid gentle sounds, things beautiful and free, These grow to help the world, where'er they be, Are undisturbed by any change of mood; But, like the Esk, from her far solitude Of inland peace and heather-purpled lea, They move to mingle with the stormy sea, In uncomplaining ministry of good. So, as I jostled down the noisy quay And leaned upon those giant-arms of stone That hold all Whitby's pride in their embrace, And nurse what weary boats will rest and stay, Methought the Lady Hilda well had done To plant her Abbey in so fair a place. V. A CONTRAST: WHITBY. Here, quayside clamour, shining fish displayed Upon the streaming stones, loud jests, and all The noises of that sea-god's festival The daily harvest of the nets has made; Here, rival echoes and the shouts of trade, A harbour's tide that changesâflow and fall: There, changeless rest, an Abbey ruin, a hall, A Church, and round it, dead in quiet laid. Oh, happy men! who, wearied of the deep, Or tired of busy chaffering down below, May look to Heaven above the smoky air, And find a stretch of grass, as tranquil now As when rough Caedmon fed the Abbey sheep, Kept calm by death and consecrate to prayer. VI. A MEMORY OF CAEDMON, WHITBY. The grey-horned Abbey, Norman Reinfrid knew, Looks o'er the red-roofed barn beneath, and still The broad-winged Church broods peaceful on the hill; And all the winds that ever favouring blew, And all the sails that ever homeward flew, When silver spoils the happy vessels fill, Have felt Saint Hilda's power to guard from ill And breathe down blessing on the strenuous crew. For as the dusky sails and dipping mast Sweep to the harbour's welcoming arms, they hear How that old song, which Caedmon learned in sleep, Still sounds from off the cottage-clustered steep; For Love alone the wandering keels can steerâ Love, of created things the first and last. VII. SUNRISE AT WHITBY. Rich orange flushed the pale horizon's bar, Yet dark and unawakened lay the town Without a breath of smoke, while Esk ran down Beneath the glory of a single star; The good wives slept, the fisher-boats were far: You could not think that care was ever known On yonder dreaming slope; no hint was shown Of what laborious dawns and daylights are. But still the planet wheeled to work and woe, The orange faded fast to common light, And that mysterious Abbey stood forlornâ A hopeless ruin in the fuller morn; An anxious boat went moving to and fro, The smoke-wreaths rose, the sails were all in sight. VIII. A SUNSET AT WHITBY. When unimaginable things are ours, How quietly the heart and pulses beat; We sit like gods in an accustomed seat, And feel the breath of some diviner powers To be but natural air; the spirit towers, And puts all common things beneath our feet: Then what we planned in dream we dare complete, And the soul claims its royalest of dowersâ Hope that can see fulfilment. Wherefore, die More slowly down, O Sun, and bring the dark, And let the purple headland in the west Hang in a saffron flood of sea and sky, For now the fisher dreams upon his barque, And all the wondering eyes of men are blest. IX. WHITBY ABBEY. Queen of the seaward Abbeys, bold to face The storms that steal, the robber eyes that rove, Not hid in some far inland hollow grove, But fearless: thou wert of a fearless race. Born of a vow that gave the Christ His place With loss to Mercia's King who vainly strove; Reborn, when soldier-zeal and knightly love Gave back thy fallen monastery grace. Still thou art not disheartened. Oswy's vow, The prayers of Hilda, Caedmon's Saxon rhyme, And those four bishops, Beverley's Saint John, Were in God's eye most precious,âand are now; And, ere the sea run dry, thy bells shall chime Up from the depths, and ring thine orison. X. WHITBY ABBEY. A MEMORY OF THE SYNOD 664, WITH ITS SETTLEMENT OF THE EASTER CONTROVERSY. How could intemperate zealâhands hot for blood Of Rome, that bade Rome's Altars be removedâ How could they spare the shrine Saint Hilda loved, Or how not banish mitre, stole, and hood? For here, in synod, when Saint Wilfrith stood To plead that Pasch with moon-change should be moved, The Royal Oswin held such custom proved If he who held the keys proclaimed it good. And though the jangle of Saint Peter's keys Locked Rome to England, and that day restored Union at home and union with the west; Tho' neither flame nor fierce Reformer's sword Can break the bond; our Church, that Rome hath blessed, Sends Rome this stern rebuke across the seas. XI. AFTER THE HERRINGS, WHITBY. They lie as they would never wake again, Those weary fisher-boats, in slumber sound; But, as one sees at times a dreaming hound Stir, and believe his phantom quarry slain, Sudden they start, and soon the ocean plain Is studded o'er with sails. Away they bound! Some keen sea-hawk the silver drove has found; The wingÃ¨d huntsmen follow in her train. With such an equal pace the swarthy keels, Slipped from their moorings, hurry to the prey, It seems as if the sky, the ocean, all Move with their motion if they move at all; And like a dream the quiet pageant steals, To melt into the far horizon's grey. XII. HERRINGS FINE! Out of the heaving dusk, toward the pier, With sun in heart, and sunrise on each keel, The herring boats flock home for morning meal; Above the rosy rooftrees, as they near, The blue smoke curls. They close their wings and steer With labouring oar; they catch the loud appeal Of loungers, asking of their woe or weal, The children's laughter, and the fishwives' cheer. Scaled o'er with silver, see, the skipper stands, While the loud bell proclaims the sample fair; Moveless of lip, he hears his net's supply Measured against a nation's whole demands; And soon the town takes up the joyous cry, And âHerrings fine!â is ringing thro' the air. XIII. IN THE UPPER HARBOUR, WHITBY. Far from the jostling market's noisy tongue, Forth from the hold they cast their pearly store, With salt in showers, and count, âOne,â âTwo,â âThree,â âFour,â The gleaming fish from crate to cask are flung, Alternate snow and silver; while, among The multitudinous barrels piled on shore, With chalk in hand, the deft-eyed merchants pore, And packing hammers merrily are swung. Then, as the hulls from out the painted tide Rise, and the decks are cleansed from fishing stain, The nets are folded and the ropes are coiled Fit for the next night's labour. âGod,â I cried, âIf those aboard Christ's Ship of Truth so toiled, We should not fish the deeps of man in vain.â XIV. THE BELL BUOY AT THE HARBOUR MOUTH, WHITBY. As if the sea were giving up her dead, And corse by corse to burial were borne, I heard the buoy-bell out of darkness mourn, And bitter were the doleful words it said: It told of waves that closed above the head Of men unshrieved, uncoffined, husbands torn From wives, and children fatherless, forlorn; Of faces gazing seaward pale with dread. But still, with melancholy sway and swing The bell gave forth its wailing funeral note, And the night thickened, and the moon went down, And the wind rose. Few boats had reached the town But for the warning of that iron throat. Henceforth, unquestioned, let the death-bell ring. XV. ON THE HARBOUR PIER, WHITBY. Sometimes there pass us by the steamers proud, Like spouting whales their hulls at distance seem, So fierce, behind, the white churned waters gleam; Anon they wrap themselves as in a shroud Of their own weaving, till the plumy cloud Hither and thither wafted, smoke and steamâ Dies out, or lingers after far abeam, Like birds that on their close-winged journey crowd. But 'mid the fisher fleet that clustering lay, With here and there a wing spread forth to dry, Resting from toil and taking strength for more, Or waiting for the harbour's open door, Our hearts were anchored; for the poor that stay Are better than the great that pass us by. XVI. LIGHTS ON WHITBY CHURCH STAIRS. When the dark seas with gems besprinkled are, And through the night the fisher lamp is swayed, Saint Hilda's Abbey slope is rich inlaid With countless suns; star shines to sister star. Dear are the heights of Heaven, but dearer far These lowly parts of earth, so lately made Heaven, with the constellations new-displayed, That never set behind the harbour bar. The suns may clash and fall, new worlds may blaze And vanish, to Andromeda's despair; And one by one the jewels of the hill Lose lustre; still the lamps upon the stair Burn steady; Perseus still the monster slays; And great Orion burns and brightens still. XVII. SAINT HILDA'S LIGHTS. When over Lythe the sun has just gone down, And opal mist has filled the hollow way Whereby the boats steal out into the bay, And audibly the sea sobs to the town, In that old church, which is the harbour's crown, Three windows brighten wondrously. Men say It is Saint Hilda, come with saint's arrayâ Slid out of Heaven to be a moment known. The fisher sees the wonder on the hill,â He takes the glow to bode a fairer wind. The babe leaps up in bed to watch the gleam, And a bright presence haunts his infant dream. Each sunset proves it is Saint Hilda's will To keep the light of other days in mind. XVIII. SUNSET LIGHTS ON THE WINDOWS OF SAINT MARY'S CHURCH, WHITBY. When grey September mingles sea and sky, And steals the headlands one by one from sight, Saint Mary's Church is filled with sudden light, And old men stare, and babes clap hands and cry. A ruby jewel, burns the Tower's one eye; The western windows, palpitating bright, Leap into flame. Such glory on the height Must well-nigh rouse the dead men where they lie. Is it some priestly pageant of old Rome, With pomp of torch and heaped-up altar fire, Has set the Church at vesper hour ablaze? Or have the Saints in glory hither come, To bid us, tho' the sun sink, still aspire To light the world they loved with prayer and praise? XIX. THE SIX O'CLOCK BELL, WHITBY. The loud bell rings, the time of toil is o'er, But the laborious ocean still works on, As though its deeds of help were never done, And to its central depths it must repour For gathering strength to bless the further shore. Led by its tireless impulse, one by one, The fisher boats without a sigh have gone Forth to their starlit watch and labour sore. There is who rests not, sleeping day nor night: This wide-embracing, this unwearied sea Shares in the mind of Him whose pulses move All thought, all action; even these boats can prove Their hearts have touches of the infinite, In that they toil for others ceaselessly. XX. THE JET WORKER. Close prisoner in his narrow dusty room, He bends and breathes above his whirring wheel; The treadle murmurs sad beneath his heel, And sad he works his jewels of the tomb, Emblems of sorrow from the darkened womb Of woods on which the Deluge set its sealâ Offerings from death to death: he needs must feel A little of his craft's incessant gloom. But, as the pewter disk to brightness runs, On Iris wings light shoots across the dusk, And leaps out joyous from the heart of jet. Lord of the Iris bow and thousand suns, By wheels of work, if men will only trust, In darkest souls Thy light and life are set. XXI. THE WHITBY BELLS. With those four sermons sounding in the air, Above the town, above the harbour boats, No need of prophets in their leathern coats, No work for priest in linen fine and fair. One cries, âLearn justice, have a reverent care For things divine;â one, âJesus, speed our notes;â From one, âPraise Heaven! On earth be peace!â down floats To those who climb the church's rocky stair. Ring out, old bells! and add the fourth stern chime Above a restless river, restless sea: Till men praise Heaven peace cannot come to earth, Of reverence only justice can have birth, With Christ alone your speed will progress beâ Christ only speed, if men repent in time. XXII. SERVICE IN THE OLD PARISH CHURCH, WHITBY. We climbed the steep where headless Edwin liesâ The king who struck for Christ, and striking fell; Beyond the harbour, tolled the beacon bell Saint Mary's peal sent down her glad replies; So entered we the Church: white galleries, Cross-stanchions, frequent stairs, dissembled well A ship's mid-hold,âwe almost felt the swell Beneath, and caught o'erhead the sailors' cries. But as we heard the congregational sound, And reasonable voice of common prayer And common praise, new wind was in our sailsâ Heart called to heart, beyond the horizon's bound With Christ we steered, through angel-haunted air, A ship that meets all storms rides out all gales. XXIII. DROWNED BY THE UPSETTING OF THE LIFE-BOAT, OCTOBER 6, 1841. A HERO'S GRAVE IN WHITBY CHURCHYARD. Rest, master mariner, rest till sealess doom: Beyond all harbour-stir upon this steep. Though murderous winds obliterating sweep. Thy deed shall keep a name upon thy tomb! Child of the ocean, to its darkened womb Who so return, regenerate, shall reap Immortal glory. Waking tho' they sleep Their deaths flash life across the desperate gloom. For what are men, if, when the storms are strong And harbours stretch their yellow arms in vain, They go not forth to succour? Wearied sore, Still must they rake the jaws of hell once more: And if they die, they know their deeds remain; And if they live, it cannot be for long. XXIV. FAREWELL TO WHITBY. Farewell! the silver dazzle of the tide, That to the Esk such life and beauty brings; The gleaming harbour towers, the glancing wings Of boats that down the slopes of ocean glide, Or hang in air, phantasmal, glorified. Farewell! the blue roof smoke that curls and clings, The solemn Abbey's overshadowings, And o'er the town, the dead men side by side. Farewell! If I should never see thee more, If not again the pivot bridge of chance Should swing above the stream of severing days, Yet still in heart I lounge along the quays, Mix in the market, learn the fishers' lore, And grasp hands round from Shetland to Penzance. XXV. THE PENNY HEDGE. If, on a day in each returning year, With horns' halloo, and shouts of âFie, for shame!â The men who knew our deed's dishonour came And cried it to the people gathered near, Should we not blench to watch that dawn appear? And how much more, if lands, and wealth, and name Were ours in tenure, so our title's claim Stood in a deed's dishonour plain and clear! Stout Percy's heart must needs have felt the scorn When those hedge stakes, in Whitby's tideway driven, Did to a gaping world his sin declare, How by a murdered priest it was forgiven. Soul, hast thou heard no conscience blow its horn, Nor slain in this world's chase a man of prayer? XXVI. THE BEGGAR'S BRIDGE, GLAISDALE. Or built by beggar boy, to riches grown, Who by this monument of thanks would prove Lapse of laborious years could not remove The mindful thanks for early kindness shown; Or whether, foiled and thwarted by the tone Of Esk in flood, some trysting gallant strove To point the unconquerable way of Love, And for Love's arrows bent this bow of stone;â From Glaisdale's hollow arch resounds the word, âThe Foss may fail,âand Arncliffe's eagle dies, The royal falcon starves on Godeland moor; Brute force and death are dwindling: Love is lord, Whether it fires the gallant's heart, or lies In tender office round the cottage door.â XXVII. ON A MOORLAND RAILWAY. Like a bronze snake the deep-run valley wound By yellow cliff and alder-sprinkled dale; High up we saw cool, silent cloudlets sail, Beneath we heard the hot wheels pulsing round; But eye and ear were wrapt as in a swound; Another scene was born, the sky went pale, The great sun died, on either side the rail New lights, new glories, lay along the ground. King of the year, high on his throne at last, Sat August, and his robes went streaming wide In purple state beyond imagining. Our envious Firedrake flew in thunder past, Threw here and there his colouds, yet could not hide The royal splendour of the Moorland King. XXVIII. PICKERING MOOR, FROM NEAR SALTERSGATE, IN HEATHER-TIME. The distance gleams from purple into rose, The moorland wears her brightest robe to-day, Wove by the hands of August, to be gay, Till one short week its beauty shall foreclose. But rosy is the time, to freedom grows The soul. Unchallenged, here the feet may stray, And music is companion all the wayâ One sweet bee monotone the heather knows. Music and work! My soul, sing loud, work fast, Till night-time weave us silence and a shroud. Too soon the bee, o'erlaboured, at his door Will fail, and fail too soon the pollen cloud; But work and sing, the honey-hours shall last, Till we have reached the sea beyond the moor. XXIX. LILLA CROSS. If some strong angel, calling bone to bone, Should from their burial mounds these warriors free, Would they not rub their eyes, and laugh to see How still the summer's yearly benison Of honey bee and heather bloom went on; Clap hands to view the white sails going free; Then, wandering westward down the purple lea, Would stop to stare at this memorial stone; Amazed, would ask, âWhat giant hither bore This sturdy bolt, what hosts from battle came And left this emblem of their victory?â Until some passing shepherd should reply, âI have not heard of Odin or of Thor; This Cross is Christ's, we conquer in His nameâ? XXX. GOATHLAND. Deep in the hollow moorland, but complete For lives that own the simple village rule, The one-belled church, the tiny cottage school, The lowly hostel where the shepherds meet. When in the vale the landscape swoons for heat And sultry August drinks the roadside pool, The air about thy brows is fresh and cool, And only heather-smoke about thy feet. Then, Goathland, to thy wilderness we turn, For there our children enter paradise: The world is larger than they else could learn; Their cheeks are flushed with every knoll's surprise, They pluck great gifts of heather and of fern, Lavish for Nature's generosities. XXXI. IN GLAISDALE WOOD. Here might the lover, with a heart like June, Go whistling on from sunshine into shade, From shade to sunshine; here the gentle maid Might think the summer twilight came too soon; Here, while o'erhead, with sympathetic croon, The doves made memory sadder as he strayed, Some sorrowful old man, his last hopes laid In ashes, yet might find thy woods a boon. The beauty, Glaisdale, of thy stream and wood Has ages incommensurate by man; It knows not time, it feels not any change. In yonder narrow vale, each cot and grange Must sing and weep alternate; but thy mood Is joy since buds broke forth or river ran. Part iv. SONNETS OF THE YORKSHIRE COASTâSCARBOROUGH. I. ROBIN HOOD'S TOWN. My eyes were full of that cliff-huddled home, With smoke, and sun, and shadow mistimpearled, White as if some Atlantic billow curled Had broke and clung, inhabitable foam. There were the men who will no longer roam, Tired of the sea, that wanders round the world, Still cannot bid their sails be wholly furled, And still must watch what vessels rise and come. And as from shore I clomb the narrow street, Thronged with its boats for safety thither brought, By stairs perplexed and passages uneven, But for the red red roofs of thy retreat, Bold Robin Hood, I verily had thought I gazed upon the sweetest scene in Devon. II. TO ROBIN HOOD'S BAY. We passed the pillars in the meadows reared To Robin Hood and Archer Little John, When, having dined off monkish venison, They shewed the Abbot why their bolts were feared; Then sudden to the sea the farm lands cleared By Saxon hatchets sloped, the moor looked on, As purple as the day the fight was won And the black raven on the Peak appeared; And down we dropped toward bold Robin's bayâ The reefs ran dark and fateful to the tide, Roof clung to roof as if they feared a wrong; None hunt wild Robin now, o'er England wide His deeds are cancelled for their gifts to songâ And hide-and-seek the peeping houses play. III. BAY TOWN. In the curved bay, where resonantly flow The north sea tides, and wondrous echo brings The noise of ships that, borne on cloudy wings, Pant round the headlands, red the roof-trees glow; Homes of the fisher, built how sailors know, With intricate care, and close up-shoulderings. Men-martlets they, the sons of robber kings, Norseman and Dane, and Robin of the bow. So planned and fashioned on their bank of shale Village and cliff are one, each open door A tiny gate to undiscovered caves. And when the sun has sunk behind the moor The cottage eyes flash fire, and o'er the waves House whispers house the smuggler's oft-told tale. IV. SCARBOROUGH CASTLE. Grim Scardeborgaâso our sages spell The name the Vikings gave theeâsince the night When fierce Hardrada from thy rocky height Rained flaky fires that on the fish-huts fell, And left them ashes, never has the smell Of fire passed from thee! Fury of the fight, Zeal for the king or for the people's right, Have flamed up fresh in yonder citadel. But they who see thy fortress-cavern gape High in the wall where once the faggot blazed, Where now the winds blow desolate and cold, May know two firesâthough here imprisoned both, Burn freeâone, Mercy, in pure woman-shape; One, zeal for God, a weaver-prophet raised. V. AT THE PARISH CHURCH, SCARBOROUGH. The bells rang loud; below, the vessels lay As if they listened to a preacher's tone, Crying, âO, wandering souls, why have ye gone Labouring in vain, and wherefore will ye stray?â I looked, and into distance, lo, the bay Gleamed like the sea that beats before the Throne,â Glass mixed with fire; and bells, waves, boats, in one, A thousand âHallelujahs!â seemed to say. I entered. In the church, the chanting choir Did but prolong that vision of accord, When all who wander, weary, tempest-tost, Shall stand upon the sea of molten fire; And, with the harps of God, a choral host Shall sing the marvellous glory of the Lord. VI. OLIVER'S MOUNT, SCARBOROUGH. When from the mask of fashion and of show I seek, green Weaponesse, thy solemn height, Again I seem to see thy beacon light Flash fire of help to friend, of hurt to foe. Great Ida's fleet has neared the cliffs of snow; From Inguar, lo! St. Hilda's monks in flight; The rash Hardrada's keels are hove in sight; And outlawed Robin scours the wood below. Dreams are but dreams! Thy beacon flares no more; No shepherd hither brings in haste his quern, Or hurries with his frightened flocks and herds. But we have need of beacon men'ries stern; Foes watch along an ease-enfeebled shore, And thy grave hill can speak Protector's words. VII. THE WANDERER'S TOMB ON THE FILEY HEIGHTS. His was no ordinary soul, the brave Who, as he felt the thundering surge of death Sound in his ears, could yet, with his last breath, Columbus-like, still murmur of the wave, And bid them lay him dead where he might have View of the long well-watered bay beneath; So with his dagger, horn, and Druid wreath, His soul might unastonied leave the grave. For he had wandered far, before he time They chose for him the hollowed oaken tree, Had warred with men, had battled much with wind; But still he kept the temper of his prime, And still the wild unconquerable sea Hid leagues of wonder for his warrior mind. VIII. THE DANE'S DYKE, FLAMBOROUGH HEAD. I cannot climb this mighty rampire's breast Without a thought of those fierce men of old, Who steered adventurous galleys, and were bold To scale the white cliff's yet unconquered breast, Smote down the hind, the shepherd dispossessed, And few, against a multitude untold, Planned out what little kingdom they could hold, And built their wall against the whole wide west. First of our land's invadersâwhether thirst For wider acres or for wiser laws, Or led by natural wish some way to win Beyond the heaving grey that hedged them inâ Theirs was the glory of a desperate cause; Others have followed after, these were first. IX. FLAMBOROUGH. Headland of flame, thy tower may flash by night, But these far-gleaming promontories glow Through mist or sunshine, citadels of snow; Above the gloomy waters, dancing light Plays in each shadowy hall and lucent bight, And wondering tides clap hands of awe, and go By milk-white monolith and portico, With swift return, as if for sheer delight. But he who wanders in thy hollow caves Will hear a wailing murmur, see the stain Like blood, in pool and on the pavement thrown; As though for all the wash of cleansing waves The signs of Ida's struggle must remain, When on the heights he won Northumbria's crown. X. SEA SYMPATHY. Weighed down beneath the inevitable press Of earthly calls, as frivolous as loud, Hemmed in and vexed with the persistent crowd Of things to do, that done are nothingness, When lips that might have sung are musicless For want of silent hearing, and the proud Exacting hours move on behind a shroud Of thought towards a tomb that none can bless; Then let the singer seek a lonely shoreâ There, like a man that dreams and walks in swound, Wrapped all about with voices, lo, the din That shuts the world without, shuts thought within, And ocean, echoing to his heart's profound, Shall stir his soul and melody restore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK VIII. SONNETS OF THE LINCOLNSHIRE COAST. I. CHILDREN ON THE SHORE. Oh! happy people, blessed in your content, The sea may flow and drown your new-won lands,â It does but make you join your merry bands, You closelier pack your busy settlement, And urge unjealous industry: here, bent On fortress mounds, the young strategist stands; There, while the farmer plans his farm in sands, With shells the gardener will his art present. But still the ocean tides impartial roll, In 'minished acres children ply the spade, With larger hearts they share the varied task, On family. Call up the child, and ask What is it such a heaven of earth has madeâ Wide lands, or wider love, and breadth of soul! II. SEA COAL. The coals were spent, the village fires burnt low Out flew the banner on the signal mast, The greybeards questioned far-off sails that past, Shading their brows and muttering ay or no; But when the kindly tide began to flow, A ship stood up, mysterious, from the vast Bewildering deep, steered straight ashore, and cast Her anchors from the stern and from the prow. Down sank the sea, out-shone the coal-black hull, The jingling carts towards its gangway sped, With mimic rolls of thunder thro' the day The weary vessel gave her heart away: Our children found next morn a hollow full Of sand-locked water, but their friend was gone. III. SKEGNESS HOUSE. It stood, the genius of the sea-blown bank, And rocked to every passing wind that blew: Far out at sea that house the pilot knew, Its friendly light the fishermen would thank. For entrance, served a solitary plank, Loud with the feet that pattered to and fro: Up to the wolds the rising sun looked through, Down to the sea looked through the sun that sank. The housewife there had little need to keep Of rosemary and lavender sweet store, Her chests were fragrant with the salt sea-air. There would the weary quite forget his care, All day could revel on the healthful shore, Lulled by its tidal tune all night could sleep. IV. THE LINCOLNSHIRE MARSH. Fringed by the sea a level plain we crost, Fresh with continual green from end to end; To far-off shepherds flocks their welcome send, Mixed with the lowings of a hornÃ¨d host; Here gleams a gate, and there a roadway post, Ever to sunset grey-blown willows bend, And, round the pastures, whispering rushes lend Their voice to swell the murmur of the coast. Here neither sheep nor shepherd-boy can ail, Glad with the green, invigorate with the gale, Unchid, across his flowery bounds may pass The lowing steer in search of sweeter grass; For they who own these herds are free of hand, And open-hearted as their breezy land. V. OLD SKEGNESS CHURCH. They built thee in far meadows, for their dread Of greedy waves against the sea-bank rolled; They set thee 'twixt the waters and the wold, And to thy church-yard frequent bridges led. Here weekly prayer the hind or fisher said, A single bell the deaths and weddings told, And twice a year they moved with tears the mould, Twice in the year came laughing to be wed. Half seen, the preacher from the pulpit's jaw Still pleads God's blessing and explains His law; Close to the roof men still on Sabbath sing, Where in the week-day doves with murmur cling: On walls of decent white, rude-lettered, see God's ten commands in their simplicity! VI. NEW SKEGNESS. Where once the fisher's cot could ill contrive A frugal welcome for the chance-come guest, In gay saloons, with ostentation drest, Large tables shine, and noisy caterers thrive; Off sands made black with swarms from labour's hive The lonely shrimpers vanish, dispossest; Where poets mused, the showman plies his jest, And jaded horses plough the sandy drive. The strenuous tide has lost its task: men rear, Of alien stone, huge barriers rudely strong; For music of the rushy bank we hear The grating bandâa stroller's gipsy song; While that sea-monster millepede, the pier, Puts out from shore to please a giddy throng. VII. WILLIAM OF WAINFLEET. The wide horizon helped his growing mind, The changing pageant of the bannered skies Forbade him trust gay-seeming enterprise, He breathed in wit with every salted wind; And yonder sea, by its own mounds confined, Chaining itself with its own ministries, Was fit instructress how, when passions rise, Of their own strength they should their raging bind Oft in the marsh, beneath a level sun, He sought with simple crook his father's sheep; Or, boyish, traced his Magdalens in the sand. The keen-faced prelate lies in marble sleep, But Cherwell's stream four hundred years has run In vain against the walls his wisdom planned. VIII. BOSTON CHURCH TOWER. Above the Egyptian plain, the earliest ray Struck tune from the Colossus, shepherds feared, And those rude boatmen of the Nile, who steered The monoliths, warped northward in dismay. But thou, great Christian Memnonâall the day In silver iterations thou art heard Insisting on the hours. The hinds are cheered, And sailors go rejoicing on their way. High-crowned thou sittest o'er the listening leas, Thy moveless feet wreathed round with shifting sand; A beacon true to men who plough the seas, A tower of hope to men who till the land; Wide fields and waters lie beneath thy care, For leagues thy guardian presence haunts the air. IX. THE EAST FEN. Land of the earlier morn, the later night, Of distance beyond distance; broader skies Where the lark sings, and where the swallow flies, This unperplexed, and that with clearer sight; Here swirl no streams, no prattle of delight Comes from the brook, no bubbling springs arise; Deep channelled waters, where the bulrush sighs, Slope, ladder-like, to Heaven, silver bright. Here pale-faced prisoned labour never comes, No furnace roar the shepherd's sleep alarms, Only at times the steamy thresher hums Among the poplars whisp'ring round the farms; And all the year, to urge the ploughman's hand, The great sea-sickle gleams about the land. X. AT MABLETHORPE: AN EPISODE IN THE PUBLICATION OF THE âPOEMS BY TWO BROTHERS.â That eve the sun set rosy o'er the wold, A burnished shield the level marsh-land lay; The reeds in wonder whispered all the way As towards the sea their car of triumph rolled; The whirling mills with voices manifold Tossed up their arms to cheer; the churches greyâ The lonely churches where the marsh men prayâ Breathed forth a blessing on the venture bold. Thou, far-retiring ocean, o'er what sands Of rippled silver glistening to the stars Didst thou entice those happy brothers' feet; With what a rhythm didst thou clap thy hands, And rear thyself above the shoally bars, And pause, and fall, their music to repeat! XI. TO SIR JOHN FRANKLIN. (BY HIS STATUE IN THE SPILSBY MARKET-PLACE, AT NIGHT.) Above thy native town a white moon shows Clouds packed as ice about the firmament And, prisoners in that frozen continent, A few faint stars to light the shifting snows: On sails the moon, dispart the hoary floes, As if a sudden summer with her went Capes melt, and opens every firth, content To give her easy passage as she goes. Now fiercer winter falls upon the sky, The moon is quenched, one star still glimmers forth: How like to thee and thine these heavens are, Thou who hast left a name that cannot dieâ A splendour in the dark disastrous north, And from thy bronze dost front the Polar star! XII. SONNET VALEDICTORY. A dome of trembling glass upon the shore Gleamed, and within were wondrously displayed Four moons, four rainbows, ringed with purple braid: Again I passed, the crystal to the core Was shrunk, its moons would lighten never more, And on the sands, sun-smit to froth, had made Impress of dissolution; grateful shade, Nor ocean cool, its beauty could restore. Go, little book, but better far be lost In deeps of song and water-floods of sound, Than, with a momentary power to please, Float in on barren beach, from shallow seas, To melt beneath fierce light, and so be found A lifeless blot, a blank, delusive ghost.</field>
