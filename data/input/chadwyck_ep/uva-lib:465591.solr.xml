      <field name="fulltext">TO THE LADY CREWE OF UTKINTON. Madam, As when the Eagle, with a Parent's Love, Prepares her Young to visit Realms above. With Heaven's full Lustre she allures him on, First to admire, and then approach the Sun; Unweary'd he surveys the Orb of Light, Charm'd by the Object to maintain his Flight. To You th' aspiring Muse her Labour brings, Thus tries its Fate, and thus expands her Wings: Tempted to gaze on Your auspicious Light, This hasty Birth to You directs its Flight; The Beauties of Your Mind transported views, Admiring Sings, and pleas'd her Flight pursues. Permit these loose, unfinish'd Lines to claim The kind Protection of your Parent's Name: Tho' void of Ornaments, and ev'ry Grace, Accept the Piece, as sacred to your Race. Where You behold your great Forefathers Fame, And trace the Springs from whence Your Virtues came: Survey the Triumphs, and the Honours view, That by a long Descent devolve on You. In vain the Muse her vanquish'd Pencil tries, Where unexhausted Stores of Beauty rise: Languid and faint her Labours must appear, Whilst You transcend her fairest Character. So bright in You your Father's Graces shine, And all the Virtues of your Ancient Line; That none with Pleasure can the Copy view, Whilst the Original survives in You. Magd. Coll. Oxon. June 2. 1704. Tho. Yalden. AN ESSAY ON THE CHARACTER OF Sir WILLOUGHBY ASTON. What Man Renown'd! what British Worthy's Praise Inspires the Muse! and consecrates her Lays! Record thy ASTON's celebrated Name, Display his Virtues, and transmit his Fame. Illustrious Actions to thy Care belong, And form the Beauties of Heroick Song: None e'er appear'd with so immense a Store, Nor ever grac'd harmonious Numbers more. Nor stain, my Muse, with thy officious Tears, The bright Example for succeeding Years: Whilst others in dejected Notes complain, Sublime thy Song, attempt a nobler Strain. With Verse asswage his Pious Off-spring's Care, And calm the Sorrows of the weeping Fair: Dispel the Shades that Fate untimely spread, And cease to mourn for the Immortal Dead. Where out-stretch'd Britain in the Ocean's lost, The Praise of the County Palatine of Cheshire And Dee, and rapid Mercy bound the Coast; There Hills arise with Silvan Honours crown'd, There fruitful Vales, and shady Streams abound. Not Median Groves, not Tempe's boasted Plain, Nor where Pactolus Sands inrich the Main, Can yield a Prospect fairer to the Sight, Nor charm with Scenes of more august Delight. Here LUPUS, and his Warlike Chiefs, obtain'd Imperial Sway, and great in Honours reign'd: Deriving Titles from their Swords alone, Their Laws preserv'd, and Liberties their own. As when two swelling Floods their Waves oppose, Nor wou'd confound the Urns from whence they rose: But by degrees uniting in a Stream, Forget their Fountains, and become the same. Thus strove the Britains with the Norman Race, Fierce with their Wrongs, and conscious of Disgrace: But when the Fury of their Arms was o'er, Whom Thirst of Empire had ingag'd before, Now Friendship binds, and Love unites the more. From whom a long Descent of Worthies shine, Just to the Glories of their Martial Line: Admiring Fame their matchless Force records, Their bounteous Minds, and hospitable Boards. Where WEEVER hastens to receive the Dane, Refreshing with united Streams the Plain; A rising Fabrick with Majestick Grace, Demands the Tribute of thy lofty Praise. Aston House, built by Sir Willoughby.There ASTON stands conspicuous to the Sight; To ASTON, Muse, direct thy pleasing Flight! From far the pompous Edifice behold, Just the Proportions, and the Structure bold. Beauty is there with Elegance express'd, Improv'd with Art, with Native Grandeur bless'd. What nobler Object could the Worthy find, To signalize the Greatness of his Mind: Than to adorn, with so august a Frame, The Place that gave his Ancestors a Name? Delightful Scene! thy Patron's early Care, Who rais'd Thee up magnificently Fair: He form'd thy Beauties, and encreas'd thy Store, Great in thy Self, but in thy Founder more. His Family.From gen'rous HUDARD, whose Victorious Sword Made ASTON stoop beneath a Foreign Lord, Twenty successive Chiefs descended down; Illustrious all, and matchless in Renown. When injur'd Barons durst by Arms restrain Their Sov'reigns Pride, on the embattl'd Plain; And Rival Roses, with impetuous Rage, Involv'd in Blood the next descending Age: Or when abroad we nobler Conquests sought, For Empire strove, for Fame and Beauty fought; Their great Exploits our British Annals grace, And Ancient Bards immortalize the Race. No Lineage can a nobler Subject yield, Nor oft'ner shar'd the Triumphs of the Field: Renown'd in War, by Arts indear'd to Fame, Worthy their high Descent, and glorious Name. But tho' so many Pious Worthies join, To form the Lustre of a Noble Line: Pass not, ungrateful Nymph, neglected by A Shade renown'd! a Name that cannot die! His Father's Fame with awful Steps pursue, And raise thy Flight with the transporting View, When loud Sedition call'd him early forth, The Character of Sir Tho. Aston. To merit Wreaths, and signalize his Worth; His bounteous Mind supply'd the Royal Part With flowing Fortunes, and a faithful Heart. His Sword and Pen were drawn in just Defence Of suff'ring Prelates, and an injur'd Prince: And as some Midnight Wolf by Hunger press'd, With boundless Fury wou'd the Plains infest: But if he hears the Lion's awful Voice, His Head he couches, and contracts his Paws. Thus raging Faction murmur'd in its Den, Restrain'd and aw'd by his sublimer Pen: And when Rebellion rear'd its guilty Head, Before his Arms the vanquish'd Monster fled. Immortal Shade! to endless Ages rest! With Joys, that never Rebel tasted, bless'd: As Champion for the sacred'st Race of Men, Accept this Tribute from a grateful Pen; Firm to the Church, and Loyal to the Crown, Is more than Fame, and sanctifies Renown. Nor wonder then so many Graces join'd, The Character of Sir Willoughby. To form the perfect Beauties of his Mind: He from his Ancestors deriv'd them down, Improving Virtues by Descent his own. And first thy ASTON's matchless Form survey, From early Youth to Nature's last Decay: The lively Features of his Beauty trace, And give each Lineament its Native Grace. Grandeur and Sweetness in his Person join'd, His Person. August his Presence, and his Aspect kind; His lofty Stature, and distinguish'd Mien, Confess'd the Greatness of a Soul within. For gen'rous Natures purifie their Clay, And o'er the Body spread a lucid Ray: Thro' ev'ry Part informing Spirits fly, Disdain Restraint, and sparkle at the Eye. Such genial Lustre, such resistless Grace His Limbs adorn'd, and triumph'd in his Face. But as the Earth, in her capacious Veins, The splendid Treasure of her Mines contains: With fading Flow'rs she paints the Surface o'er, But inward shines with unexhausted Store. So lovely Forms are on Mankind bestow'd, Only to dignifie the Soul's Abode: Within the Beams of sparkling Wit we find, The Charms of Sense, and Treasures of the Mind. Indulgent Nature thus her Bounty show'd, Thus ev'ry shining Faculty bestow'd: With Stores inrich'd his intellectual Sent, And form'd the Lustre of his Mind compleat. His Education at Cambridge;Where aged CHAM in fam'd Meanders flows, His early Youth a soft Retirement chose: To rest beneath the venerable Shade, Where SPENCER sung, and COWLEY's Muse was laid. Propitious Nature had prepar'd before, A Mind tenacious of the learned Store: The flowing Springs of Knowledge to receive, And take Impressions fast as Art cou'd give. Auspicious CHAM! not all thy boasted Race Of tuneful Youths, that celebrate thy Praise; That in the various Spheres of Learning shine; Belov'd by Phœbus and the sacred Nine; With nobler Wreaths did e'er thy Temples crown, Or add, like him, to thy diffus'd Renown. And at the Temple.And next the flowing Robe employ'd his Care, And bulky Volumes of the painful Bar: Tho' Wealth and Fame the Toilsome Search attend, Yet he pursu'd it for a nobler End. Obscure and intricate our Laws appear, Perplex'd with Comments that shou'd make them clear: His Justice thro' the gloomy Mists survey'd, And Reason found by Subtleties betray'd; With Eloquence he smooth'd the rugged Way, And scatter'd Shades with Judgment's piercing Ray. His LearningHe Nature in her dark Recesses sought, And with Philosophy sublim'd his Thought. In all the various Parts of Learning skill'd, That Grecian Sages, or the Roman yield: He from the Ancients drein'd their richest Store, Refining still with Wit the sparkling Ore. Nor did he want the Lyre's harmonious Sound, Whose pleasing Accents all his Labours crown'd: The tuneful Lyre, that charms us with Delight, Repels our Cares, and glads the tedious Night; Restrains our Passions, calms our furious Rage, The Joy of Youth, and the Relief of Age. His piercing Faculties, serenely bright, Let inward to the Soul distincter Light: His Senses exquisite, and Reason sound, Surmounted all the Obstacles they found, In Knowledge verss'd, in Learning's Depths profound. His Accomplishments.Nor were his Hours to Books alone confin'd, His Person was accomplish'd as his Mind: He us'd his Weapons with admir'd Success, Excell'd in Courtship, and a kind Address. Whether he urg'd the Courser to his Speed, Or temper'd, with his Skill, the fiery Steed; When foaming at the Ring he spurns the Sands, Repeats his Stroaks, and lanches as he stands: With grateful Gesture he did each command, And ply'd his Reins with an instructive Hand. Or whether to the sportive Dance inclin'd, In lively Measures he the Consort join'd: None ever mov'd with more majestic Pace, Show'd greater Art, or more becoming Grace. His flowing Wit, with solid Judgment join'd, His Conversation Talents united rarely in a Mind, Had all the Graces, and engaging Art, That charm the Ear, and captivate the Heart. No pointed Satyr, nor morose Disdain, Allay'd the Pleasure of his Words with Pain: His inoffensive Tongue, from Slander free, From Flatt'ry's Vice, or blasting Calumny; Knew all the Springs that secret Passions move, Raise Admiration, or inspire with Love. Sententious and instructive his Discourse, He urg'd his Reasons with resistless Force. A lively Eloquence adorn'd his Thought, And happy Turns of Wit occurr'd unsought: Expressive Words his flowing Sense convey'd, Just were his Thoughts, and pow'rful to persuade. But, Goddess, now a Nobler Scene survey, His Moral and Intellectual Virtues. Expand thy Wings, thy brightest Charms display! What various Beauties here distract thy Sight! What Virtues that surmount thy towring Flight! As nameless Stars, that form the Galexy, With undistinguish'd Lustre guild the Sky; So shone the Graces that adorn'd his Mind, And with concenter'd Rays their Beauties join'd: Whose lucid Numbers but repel thy Sight, And, thus united, form one Glorious Orb of Light. His Riper Years to Wisdom he apply'd Each Path pursu'd, and ev'ry Conquest try'd: Wisdom, the darling Attribute alone, By which th' Almighty's more distinctly known: And when contracted to a narrow Span, Becomes the noblest Faculty of Man. Thro' Books he trac'd her in the pleasing Chace, Ransack'd their Stores, and still maintain'd his Pace. With Crouds, and busie Men, he strove to find The flying Fair, the Object of his Mind: Thro' specious Arts, thro' all their vain Disguise, He saw, distinguish'd, and obtain'd the Prize. His Mind, with each superior Talent fraught, For Councils form'd his enterprising Thought: Quick of Dispatch, discreet in ev'ry Trust, Rigidly honest, and severely just. Tho' Kindness in his generous Bosom reign'd, The Dignity of Pow'r he still maintain'd: None e'er discharg'd Affairs with more Adress, Serv'd better Publick Posts, or sought them less. His Constancy appear'd in ev'ry State, Fix'd and unmov'd as the Decrees of Fate: No fluctuating Doubts his Mind distress'd, Nor shook the strong Foundations of his Breast. His Resolution bore him still above The rash Effects of Enmity or Love: Firm on the Basis of himself he stood, Of Right tenacious, permanent in Good. Hence flow'd a Courage unallay'd with Fear, A Mind undaunted, and a Conscience clear: With Innocence, and Virtue for a Guide, Successfully he stem'd th' impetuous Tide. Intrepid thus he Revolutions bore, Nor deviated from Paths he trod before: The Pow'r of Fortune still disdain'd to own, Nor courted Smiles, nor sunk beneath her Frown. He serv'd his Country, with Regards above The common Views of mercenary Love: His Passion such, if not extended more, As Pious Romans to their Latium bore. No specious Kindness popularly feign'd, By Interest rais'd, or with Ambition stain'd: The tender Piety his Actions show'd, From Duty sprung, from fond Affection flow'd. Untainted with the Stains of either Vice, Of lavish Waste, or grasping Avarice: Nor squander'd Wealth, nor with a sordid Breast Condemn'd to Hords the Treasures he possess'd. His hospitable Roof, with Plenty stor'd, Enjoy'd the Blessings of a smiling Board: Heaven, that had bless'd him with a large Encrease, Gave him a Soul deserving to possess. The Father's Loyalty descended down, Endear'd by Sufferings, to his rival Son. As Hannibal pursu'd the Roman State, With double Portions of his Father's Hate: Such fix'd Aversion in his Bosom sprung, And arm'd his Soul against our Factions, young; A murder'd Prince, and slaughter'd Parent's Fate, On the Rebellious Race entail'd his Hate: Firm to the Crown his Duty he retain'd, And o'er his Heart his rightful Monarch reign'd. His Piety.View Beauties yet of a sublimer kind, The Heav'nly Off-spring of a Pious Mind: Charms that from Innocence and Virtue flow, That to Religion all their Splendor owe; Where no obscuring Spots their Lustre hide, By Crimes untainted, undeform'd with Pride. Bless'd Charity, the pure Etherial Ray, That Heav'n it self does to our Breasts convey; In larger Portions to his Bosom came, And o'er his Soul diffus'd a stronger Flame. In him the Wretched always found Relief. Patron of Want, Redressor of their Grief: To him th' Afflicted never su'd in vain, He felt their Miseries and eas'd their Pain. In midst of Plenty free from sensual Vice, Nor more indulg'd than Nature would suffice: The calm and equal Temper of his Soul, Did ev'ry guilty Appetite control; Within their Womb the vicious Seeds suppress'd, And strangl'd forming Passions in his Breast. The Church in him enjoy'd a faithful Son, His Religion. Whose Duty with his early Years begun: A virtuous Life his just Obedience show'd, And from Religion his Affection flow'd, Long Application fix'd his Heart secure, He search'd her Doctrines, and he found them pure. The Liturgy employ'd his daily Care, His Publick Worship, and his Private Pray'r: To all its Rites Conformity he pay'd, The Service lov'd, and Discipline obey'd. Such strong Devotion, such Celestial Fire, Inflam'd his Heart, and did his Breast inspire: As if Religion had engross'd the whole, And Heav'n remain'd the Object of his Soul. Descend, my Muse, here stop thy pleasing Flight, For mournful Prospects, gloomy Shades of Night. Attend the last expiring Scene of Life, A painful Conflict, and unequal Strife: Where Nature languishes beneath the Weight Of racking Torments, and approaching Fate. With matchless Patience, and undaunted Mind, He bore his Anguish, and his Soul resign'd: As he the glorious Prospect kept in View, And our Old World rejected for the New. The bounteous Heavens their fruitful Blessings shed, His Issue. And chast LUCINA crown'd his Nuptial Bed: From whence a fair and num'rous Off-spring came, The happy Pledges of a Mutual Flame. From warlike HUDARD, Founder of his Race, Twenty renown'd Descents his Lineage grace: And from his Loins compleat the Number sprung, For ev'ry Ancestor a smiling Young. The happy Husband of a matchless Dame, Endear'd by Virtues, and unblemish'd Fame: No guilty Passion ever claim'd a Part, The Consort of his Bed engross'd his Heart. As two fair Tapers burn with equal Flame, Their Heat proportion'd, and their Light the same: And tho' by slow Degrees they both decline, Both to the last with the same Lustre shine. Such equal Flames inspir'd the Happy Fair, Mutual their Passions, and the same their Care: Tho' Years expir'd, and Youth consum'd away, Their fond Affections never felt Decay. As when the Sun our Hemisphere resigns, He leaves us Light, and by Reflection shines: And when the gloomy Interval is o'er, He rises bright and glorious as before. Such Likeness in his Successor we find, Left as the Image of himself behind: With all the Virtues of his Race endew'd; The happy Father's in the Son renew'd. Methinks I see a pompous Tomb arise, Beauteous the Form, magnificent the Size: Inchas'd with Ore, with well-wrought Marble made, Worthy the Artist, and the glorious Shade. His Monument.Crouds of officious Angels weep around, With Lamps extinguish'd, and their Robes unbound: With Heads reclin'd, and drooping Wings they mourn, Form'd to sustain, and grace the pond'rous Urn. In abject Postures, and a flowing Dress, Postures that Love and Tenderness express: The Sacred Nine surround the spacious Tomb, And spread infectious Sorrows o'er the Dome; Their Lyres unstrung are thrown neglected by, And scatter'd Wreaths in just Disorder lye. High in the midst is his Effigies plac'd, The Boast of Art, with ev'ry Beauty grac'd. Advancing Age in ev'ry Line appears, And shades his Brow with Honourable Years: Just to his Form, his Looks dissembl'd right, With Joy detain the fond Spectator's Sight. Descending Phœbus crowns the upper Scene, His Arm extended with triumphant Green: The Sacred Wreath around his Brows to place, And shedding on him the Paternal Rays. In vain, alas! we Mausoleums raise, Statues erect, and Pyramids of Praise: A nobler Monument remains behind, The lively Image of his generous Mind, The Sacred Pile rais'd by his Pious Care, Magnificent with Cost, with Order fair; Adorn'd with all that lavish Art cou'd give, To late Posterity shall make him live. This shall diffuse his celebrated Name, More than the Hundred Tongues of busie Fame: His Memory from dark Oblivion save, Elude his Fate, and triumph o'er the Grave. FINIS.</field>
