      <field name="fulltext">His body sleeps but not his better part, And death is vanquished by victorious art</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONG [When Orpheus sweetly did complayne] When Orpheus sweetly did complayne Upon his lute with heavy strayne How his Euridice was slayne, The trees to heare Obtayn'd an eare, And after left it off againe. At every stroake and every stay The boughs kept time, and nodding lay, And listened bending all one way: The aspen tree As well as hee Began to shake and learn'd to play. If wood could speake, a tree might heare, If wood could sound true greife so neare A tree might dropp an amber teare: If wood so well Could ring a knell The Cipres might condole the beare. The standing nobles of the grove Hearing dead wood so speak and move The fatall axe beganne to love: They envyde death That gave such breath As men alive doe saints above. IN COMMENDATION OF MUSICK When whispering straynes doe softly steale With creeping passion through the hart, And when at every touch wee feele Our pulses beate and beare a part; When thredds can make A hartstring shake Philosophie Can scarce deny The soule consists of harmony. When unto heavenly joy wee feyne Whatere the soule affecteth most, Which onely thus wee can explayne By musick of the winged hoast, Whose layes wee think Make starres to winke, Philosophie Can scarce deny Our soules consist of harmony. O lull mee, lull mee, charming ayre, My senses rock with wonder sweete; Like snowe on wooll thy fallings are, Soft, like a spiritts, are thy feete: Greife who need feare That hath an eare? Down lett him lye And slumbring dye, And change his soule for harmony. SONG [Keepe on your maske, and hide your eye] Keepe on your maske, and hide your eye, For with beholding you I dye: Your fatall beauty, Gorgon-like, Dead with astonishment will strike; Your piercing eyes if them I see Are worse than basilisks to mee. Shutt from mine eyes those hills of snowe, Their melting valleys doe not showe; Their azure paths lead to dispaire, O vex me not, forbeare, forbeare; For while I thus in torments dwell The sight of heaven is worse than hell. Your dayntie voyce and warbling breath Sound like a sentence pass'd for death; Your dangling tresses are become Like instruments of finall doome. O if an Angell torture so, When life is done where shall I goe? ANOTHER VERSION TO HIS MISTRESSE Keepe on your mask and hide your eye For in beholding you I dye. Your fatall beauty Gorgon-like Dead with astonishment doth strike. Your piercing eyes that now I see Are worse than Basilisks to me. Shut from mine eyes those hills of snow, Their melting vally do not shew: Those azure paths lead to despaire, O vex me not, forbear, forbear; For while I thus in torments dwell The sight of Heaven is worse than Hell. In those faire cheeks two pits doe lye To bury those slaine by your eye: So this at length doth comfort me That fairely buried I shall be: My grave with Roses, Lillies, spread, Methinks tis life for to be dead: Come then and kill me with your eye, For if you let me live I dye. When I perceive your lips againe Recover those your eyes have slaine, With kisses that (like balsome pure) Deep wounds as soone as made doe cure, Methinks tis sicknesse to be sound, And there's no health to such a wound. When in your bosome I behold Two hills of snow yet never cold, Which lovers, whom your beauty kills, Revive by climing those your hills, Methinks there's life in such a death That gives a hope of sweeter breath: Then since one death prevails not where So many antidotes are nere, And your bright eyes doe but in vaine Kill those who live as fast as slaine; That I no more such death survive Your way's to bury me alive In place unknown, and so that I Being dead may live and living dye. SONG [O when will Cupid shew such arte] O when will Cupid shew such arte To strike two lovers with one darte? I'm ice to him or hee to mee; Two hearts alike there seldome bee. If thrice ten thousand meete together How scarce one face is like another! If scarce two faces can agree Two hearts alike there seldome bee. A SONG ON A SIGH. O tell mee, tell, thou god of wynde, In all thy cavernes canst thou finde A vapor, fume, a gale or blast Like to a sigh which love doth cast? Can any whirlwynde in thy vault Plough upp earth's breast with like assault? Goe wynde and blowe thou where thou please, Yea breathles leave mee to my ease. If thou be wynde, O then refrayne From wracking whiles I thus complayne: If thou be wynde then light thou art, Yet O! how heavy is my hart! If thou be wynde then purge thy way, Lett cares that clogge thy force obey. Goe wynde and blow thou where thou please, Yea breathles leave mee to my ease. Those blasts of sighing raised are By influence of my bright starre; Their Æolus from whom they came Is love that straynes to blow his flame, The powerfull sway of whose behest Makes hearth and bellowes of my breast. Goe wynde and blowe then where thou please, Yea breathles leave mee to my ease. Know 'tis a wynde that longs to blowe Upon my Saint wherere shee goe, And stealing through her fanne it beares Soft errands to her lippes and eares, And then perhapps a passage makes Downe to her heart when breath shee takes. Goe wynde and blowe then where thou please, Yea breathles leave mee to my ease. Yes, gentle gale, trye that againe, O doe not passe from mee in vayne, Goe mingle with her soule divine Ingendring spiritts like to mine: Yea take my soule along with thee To worke a stronger sympathie: Goe wynde and blowe thou where thou please, Yea breathles leave mee to my ease. My soule, before my grosser part, Thus to her heaven should departe, And where the body cannott lye On wings of wynde my soule shall flye: If not one soule our bodies joyne, One body shall our soules confine, Goe wynde and blowe thou where thou please, Yea breathles leave mee to my ease. A SONG ON THE BATHS What Angel stirrs this happy Well, Some Muse from thence come shew't me, One of those naked Graces tell That Angels are for beauty: The Lame themselves that enter here Come Angels out againe, And Bodies turne to Soules all cleere, All made for joy, noe payne. Heate never was so sweetely mett With moist as in this shower: Old men are borne anew by swett Of its restoring pow'r: When crippl'd joynts we suppl'd see, And second lives new come, Who can deny this Font to be The Bodies Christendome? One Bath so fiery is you'l thinke The Water is all Spirit, Whose quick'ning streames are like the drink Whereby we Life inheritt: The second Poole of middle straine Can wive Virginity, Tempting the blood to such a vayne One sexe is He and She. The third where horses plunge may bring A Pegasus to reare us, And call for pens from Bladud's wing For legging those that beare us. Why should Physitians thither fly Where Waters med'cines be, Physitians come to cure thereby, And are more cur'd than we. SONG A STRANGE GENTLEWOMAN PASSING BY HIS WINDOW As I out of a casement sent Mine eyes as wand'ring as my thought, Upon no certayne object bent, But only what occasion brought, A sight surpriz'd my hart at last, Nor knewe I well what made it burne; Amazement held me then so fast I had no leasure to discerne. Sure 'twas a Mortall, but her name, Or happy parentage or place, Or (that which did mee most inflame) I cannot tell her very Face: No; 'twere prophane to think I could, And I should pitch my thoughts too lowe If ever sett my love I should On that which Art or Words can shewe. Was ever man so vext before, Or ever love so blind as this, Which vows and wishes to implore, And yet not knows for what to wish? Thus children spend theyr wayward cryes, Not knowing why they doe complayne; Thus sicke men long for remedyes, Not knowing what would ease theyr payne. Some god call backe againe that sight; Ile suffer double payne to boote, For griefe and anger in mee fight So strongly at no marke to shoote! Not only meanes to winne her grace, But meanes to seeke are barr'd from mee; Despayre enforc't by such a case Is not a sinne but miserie. Pygmalion hold thine Image fast, 'Tis something to enjoy Love so: Narcissus thou a shaddowe hast, At least thereby to cheate thy woe; But I no likenesse can inferre My pyning fancy to supply; Nothing to love instead of her For feare of some idolatry. SONG ON A FRIENDS ABSENCE Come, come, I faint: thy heavy stay Doubles each houre of the day: The winged hast of nimble love Makes aged Time not seeme to move: Did not the light, And then the night Instruct my sight I should believe the Sunne forgot his flight. Show not the drooping marygold Whose leaves like grieving amber fold: My longing nothing can explain But soule and body rent in twain: Did I not moane, And sigh and groane, And talk alone, I should believe my soul was gone from home. She's gone, she's gone, away she's fled, Within my breast to make her bed, In me there dwels her tenant woe, And sighs are all the breath I blow: Then come to me, One touch of thee Will make me see If loving thee I live or dead I be. MELANCHOLLY Hence, hence, all you vaine delights, As short as are the nights Wherein you spend your folly: Ther's nought in this life sweete, If men were wise to see'te But only Melancholly: O sweetest Melancholly! Welcome folded armes and fixed eyes, A sigh that piercing mortifies, A looke that's fastned to the ground, A tongue chayned upp without a sound. Fountains heads, and pathlesse groves, Places which pale Passion loves: Moonlike wakes, when all the Fowles Are warmly housde, save Batts and Owles: A midnight knell: a parting groane: These are the sounds wee feede upon. Then, stretch your bones in a still gloomy vally, Ther's nothing daynty, sweete, save Melancholly. OPPOSITE TO MELANCHOLY Returne my joyes, and hither bring A tongue not made to speake but sing, A jolly spleene, an inward feast, A causelesse laugh without a jest, A face which gladnesse doth anoynt, An arm that springs out of his joynt, A sprightfull gate that leaves no print, And makes a feather of a flint, A heart that's lighter than the ayre, An eye still dancing in his spheare, Strong mirth which nothing can controule, A body nimbler than the soule, Free wandring thoughts not tyde to muse Which thinke on all things, nothing choose, Which ere we see them come are gone; These life itselfe doth feede upon. A TRANSLATION OF THE NIGHTINGALE OUT OF STRADA Now the declining sun 'gan downwards bend From higher heavens, and from his locks did send A milder flame, when near to Tiber's flow A lutinist allay'd his careful woe With sounding charms, and in a greeny seat Of shady oake took shelter from the heat. A Nightingale oreheard him, that did use To sojourn in the neighbour groves, the muse That fill'd the place, the Syren of the wood; Poore harmless Syren, stealing neare she stood Close lurking in the leaves attentively Recording that unwonted melody: Shee cons it to herselfe and every strayne His finger playes her throat return'd again. The lutinist perceives an answeare sent From th' imitating bird and was content To shewe her play; more fully then in hast He tries his lute, and (giving her a tast Of the ensuing quarrel) nimbly beats On all his strings; as nimbly she repeats, And (wildely ranging ore a thousand keys) Sends a shrill warning of her after-layes. With rolling hand the Lutinist then plies His trembling threads; sometimes in scornful wise He brushes down the strings and keemes them all With one even stroke; then takes them severall And culles them ore again. His sparkling joynts (With busy descant mincing on the points) Reach back with busy touch: that done hee stayes, The bird replies, and art with art repayes, Sometimes as one unexpert or in doubt How she might wield her voice, shee draweth out Her tone at large and doth at first prepare A solemne strayne not weav'd with sounding ayre, But with an equall pitch and constant throate Makes clear the passage of her gliding noate; Then crosse division diversly shee playes, And loudly chanting out her quickest layes Poises the sounds, and with a quivering voice Falls back again: he (wondering how so choise, So various harmony should issue out From such a little throate) doth go about Some harder lessons, and with wondrous art Changing the strings, doth upp the treble dart, And downwards smites the base; with painefull stroke Hee beats, and as the trumpet doth provoke Sluggards to fight, even so his wanton skill With mingled discords joynes the hoarse and shrill: The Bird this also tunes, and while she cutts Sharp notes with melting voice, and mingled putts Measures of middle sound, then suddenly Shee thunders deepe, and juggs it inwardly, With gentle murmurs, cleare and dull shee sings, By course, as when the martial warning rings: Beleev't the minstrel blusht; with angry mood Inflam'd, quoth hee, thou chauntresse of the wood, Either from thee Ile beare the prize away, Or vanquisht break my lute without delay. Inimitable accents then hee straynes; His hand flyes ore the strings: in one hee chaynes Four different numbers, chasing here and there, And all the strings belabour'd everywhere: Both flatt and sharpe hee strikes, and stately grows To prouder straynes, and backwards as he goes Doubly divides, and closing upp his layes Like a full quire a shouting consort playes; Then pausing stood in expectation If his corrival now dares answeare on; But shee when practice long her throate had whett, Induring not to yield, at once doth sett Her spiritt all of worke, and all in vayne; For while shee labours to express againe With nature's simple touch such diverse keyes, With slender pipes such lofty noates as these, Orematcht with high designes, orematcht with woe, Just at the last encounter of her foe Shee faintes, shee dies, falls on his instrument That conquer'd her; a fitting monument. So far even little soules are driven on, Struck with a vertuous emulation. ON WESTWELL DOWNES When Westwell Downes I gan to tread, Where cleanely wynds the greene did sweepe, Methought a landskipp there was spread, Here a bush and there a sheepe: The pleated wrinkles of the face Of wave-swolne earth did lend such grace, As shadowings in Imag'ry Which both deceive and please the eye. The sheepe sometymes did tread the maze By often wynding in and in, And sometymes round about they trace Which milkmayds call a Fairie ring: Such semicircles have they runne, Such lynes acrosse so trymly spunne That sheppeards learne whenere they please A new Geometry with ease. The slender food upon the downe Is allwayes even, allwayes bare, Which neither spring nor winter's frowne Can ought improve or ought impayre: Such is the barren Eunuches chynne, Which thus doth evermore begynne With tender downe to be orecast Which never comes to haire at last. Here and there twoe hilly crests Amiddst them hugg a pleasant greene, And these are like twoe swelling breasts That close a tender fall betweene. Here would I sleepe, or read, or pray From early morne till flight of day: But harke! a sheepe-bell calls mee upp, Like Oxford colledge bells, to supp. ON A GREAT HOLLOW TREE. Preethee stand still awhile, and view this tree Renown'd and honour'd for antiquitie By all the neighbour twiggs; for such are all The trees adjoyning, bee they nere so tall, Comparde to this: if here Jacke Maypole stood All men would sweare 'twere but a fishing rodde. Mark but the gyant trunk, which when you see You see how many woods and groves there bee Compris'd within one elme. The hardy stocke Is knotted like a clubb, and who dares mocke His strength by shaking it? Each brawny limbe Could pose the centaure Monychus, or him That wav'de a hundred hands ere hee could wield That sturdy waight, whose large extent might shield A poore man's tenement. Greate Ceres' oake Which Erisichthon feld, could not provoke Halfe so much hunger for his punishment As hewing this would doe by consequent. Nothing but age could tame it: Age came on, And loe a lingering consumption Devour'd the entralls, where an hollow cave Without the workman's helpe beganne to have The figure of a Tent: a pretty cell Where grand Silenus might not scorne to dwell, And owles might feare to harbour, though they brought Minerva's warrant for to bear them out In this their bold attempt. Looke down into The twisted curles, the wreathing to and fro Contrived by nature: where you may descry How hall and parlour, how the chambers lie. And wer't not strange to see men stand alone On leggs of skinne without or flesh or bone? Or that the selfe same creature should survive After the heart is dead? This tree can thrive Thus maym'd and thus impayr'd: no other proppe, But only barke remayns to keep it uppe. Yet thus supported it doth firmly stand, Scorning the saw-pitt, though so neere at hand. No yawning grave this grandsire Elme can fright, Whilst yongling trees are martyr'd in his sight. O learne the thrift of Nature, that maintaines With needy myre stolne upp in hidden veynes So great a bulke of wood. Three columes rest Upon the rotten trunke, wherof the least Were mast for Argos. Th' open backe below And three long leggs alone doe make it shew Like a huge trivett, or a monstrous chayre With the heeles turn'd upward. How proper, ô how fayre A seate were this for old Diogenes To grumble in and barke out oracles, And answere to the Raven's augury That builds above. Why grew not this strange tree Neere Delphos? had this wooden majesty Stood in Dodona forrest, then would Jove Foregoe his oake, and only this approve. Had those old Germans that did once admire Deformed Groves; and worshipping with fire Burnt men unto theyr gods: had they but seene These horrid stumps, they canonizde had beene, And highly too. This tree would calme more gods Than they had men to sacrifice by odds. You Hamadryades, that wood-borne bee, Tell mee the causes, how this portly tree Grew to this haughty stature? Was it then Because the mummys of so many men Fattned the ground? or cause the neighbor spring Conduits of water to the roote did bring? Was it with Whitsun sweat, or ample snuffes Of my Lord's beere that such a bignesse stuffes And breaks the barke? O this it is, no doubt: This tree, I warrant you, can number out Your Westwell annals, &amp; distinctly tell The progresse of this hundred years, as well By Lords and Ladies, as ere Rome could doe By Consulships. These boughes can witnesse too How goodman Berry tript it in his youth, And how his daughter Joane, of late forsooth Became her place. It might as well have grown, If Pan had pleas'd, on toppe of Westwell downe, Instead of that proud Ash; and easily Have given ayme to travellers passing by With wider armes. But see, it more desirde Here to bee lov'd at home than there admirde: And porter-like it here defends the gate, As if it once had beene greate Askapate. Had warlike Arthur's dayes enjoy'd this Elme Sir Tristram's blade and good Sir Lancelot's helme Had then bedeckt his locks, with fertile store Of votive reliques which those champions wore: Untill perhaps (as 'tis with great men found) Those burdenous honours crusht it to the ground: But in these merry times 'twere farre more trimme If pipes and citterns hung on every limbe; And since the fidlers it hath heard so long, I'me sure by this time it deserves my song. ON FAYRFORD WINDOWES I know no paynt of poetry Can mend such colourd Imag'ry In sullen inke: yet Fayrford, I May relish thy fayre memory. Such is the Ecchoes faynter sound, Such is the light when sunne is drownd; So did the fancy looke upon The worke before it was begunne: Yet when those shewes are out of sight My weaker colours may delight. Those Images so faythfully Report true feature to the eye As you may thinke each picture was Some visage in a looking-glasse; Not a glasse-window face, unlesse Such as Cheapside hath: where a presse Of paynted gallants looking out Bedecke the Casement round about: But these have holy physnomy: Each pane instructs the Laity With silent eloquence: for here Devotion leads the eye, not eare, To note the catechising paynt, Whose easy phrase doth so acquaint Our sense with Gospell that the Creede In such a hand the weake may reade: Such types even yet of vertue bee, And Christ, as in a glasse wee see. Behold two turtles in one cage, With such a lovely equipage, As they who knew them long may doubt Some yong ones have bin stollen out. When with a fishing rodde the clarke Saint Peters draught of fish doth marke, Such is the scale, the eye, the finne, Youd thinke they strive and leape within; But if the nett, which holds them breake, Hee with his angle some would take. But would you walke a turne in Pauls? Looke uppe; one little pane inroules A fayrer temple: fling a stone The Church is out o'the windowes throwne. Consider, but not aske your eyes, And ghosts at midday seeme to rise: The Saynts there, striving to descend, Are past the glasse, and downward bend. Looke there! The Divell! all would cry Did they not see that Christ was by: See where he suffers for thee: see His body taken from the Tree: Had ever death such life before? The limber corps, besullyd ore With meager palenesse, doth display A middle state twixt Flesh and Clay: His armes and leggs, his head and crowne, Like a true Lambskinne dangling downe, Who can forbeare, the Grave being nigh, To bring fresh oyntment in his eye? The wondrous art hath equall fate, Unfencd and yet unviolate: The Puritans were sure deceivd, And thought those shadowes movde and heavde, So held from stoning Christ: the winde And boystrous tempests were so kinde As on his Image not to prey, Whom both the winds and seas obey. At Momus wish bee not amazd; For if each Christian heart were glazde With such a window, then each breast Might bee his owne Evangelist. ON A GENTLEWOMAN'S BLISTRED LIPP Hide not that sprouting lipp, nor kill The juicy bloome with bashfull skill: Know it is an amorous dewe That swells to court thy corall hewe, And what a blemish you esteeme To other eyes a pearle may seeme Whose watery growth is not above The thrifty seize that pearles doe love, And doth so well become that part That chance may seeme a secret art. Doth any judge that face lesse fayre Whose tender silke a mole doth beare? Or will a diamond shine less cleare If in the midst a soil appeare? Or else that eye a finer nett Whose glasse is ring'd about with jett? Or is an apple thought more sweete When hony specks and redde doe meete? Then is the lipp made fayrer by Such sweetness of deformitie. The nectar which men strive to sipp Springs like a well upon your lipp, Nor doth it shew immodesty, But overflowing chastity. O who will blame the fruitfull trees When too much sapp and gumme hee sees? Here nature from her store doth send Only what other parts can lend; The budde of love which here doth growe Were too too sweete if pluckt belowe; When lovely buddes ascend so high The roote belowe cannot be drye. TO A GENTLEWOMAN FOR A FRIEND No marvell if the Sunne's bright eye Shower downe hott flames; that qualitie Still waytes on light; but when wee see Those sparkling balles of ebony Distil such heat, the gazer straight Stands so amazed at the sight As when the lightning makes a breach Through pitchie clouds: can lightning reach The marrowe hurting not the skynne? Your eyes to me the same have byn; Can jett invite the loving strawe With secrett fire? so those can draw, And can, where ere they glance a dart, Make stubble of the strongest hart. Oft when I looke I may descry A little face peep through your eye; Sure 'tis the boy, who wisely chose His throne among such rayes as those, Which, if his quiver chance to fail, May serve for darts to kill withal: If to such powerful shafts I yeild, If with so many wounds I bleed, Think me noe coward, though I lye Thus prostrate with your charming eye: Did I say but your eye? I sweare Death's in your beauty everywhere. Your waxen hands when I recall, Your lily breasts, their melting vale, Your damaske cheeks, your lilly skynne, Your corral lipp and dainty chynne, Your shining locks and amber breath, All pleasing instruments of death, Your eye may spare itselfe: mine owne When all your parts are duly knowne From any part may fetch a dart To wound itselfe. Kill not my hart, By saying that I will dispise The parentage from which you rise: I know it well, and likewise knowe That I my myselfe my breath doe owe To Woolsey's roofe, and can it bee I should disdayne your pedigree? Or is your Sire a butcher found? The fitter you to make a wound; Wound mee againe and more and more, So you againe will mee restore, But if resemblance tell the father I think hee was an Angell rather. FOR A GENTLEMAN, WHO, KISSINGE HIS FRIEND AT HIS DEPARTURE LEFT A SIGNE OF BLOOD ON HER What mystery was this; that I should finde My blood in kissing you to stay behinde? 'Twas not for want of color that requirde My blood for paynt: No dye could be desirde On that fayre silke, where scarlett were a spott And where the juice of lillies but a blotte. 'Twas not the signe of murther that did taynt The harmlesse beauty of so pure a saynt: Yes, of a loving murther, which rough steele Could never worke; such as we joy to feele: Wherby the ravisht soule though dying lives, Since life and death the selfsame object gives. If at the presence of a murtherer The wound will bleede and tell the cause is ther, A touch will doe much more, and thus my heart, When secretly it felt the killing darte, Shew'd it in blood: which yet doth more complayne Because it cannot be so touched againe. This wounded heart, to shew its love most true, Sent forth a droppe and writ its minde on you. Never was paper halfe so white as this, Nor waxe so yeelding to the printed kisse, Nor seal'd so strong. Noe letter ere was writt That could the author's minde so truly hitt. For though myselfe to foreigne countries flie, My blood desires to keepe you company. Here could I spill it all: thus I can free Mine enemy from blood, though slayne I be: But slayne I cannot bee, nor meete with ill, Since but by you I have no blood to spill. ON A DISSEMBLER Could any shewe where Plynyes people dwell Whose head stands in their breast; who cannot tell A smoothing lye because their open hart And lippes are joyn'd so neare, I would depart As quick as thought, and there forgett the wrongs Which I have suffer'd by deceitfull tongues. I should depart where soules departed bee, Who being freed from cloudy flesh, can see Each other so immediately, so cleare That none needs tongue to speak, nor ears to hear. Were tongues intended to express the soule, And can wee better doe't with none at all? Were words first made our meaning to reveale, And are they usde our meaning to conceale? The ayre by which wee see, will that turne fogg? Our breath turne mist? Will that become a clogg That should unload the mynde? Fall we upon Another Babell's sub-confusion? And in the self-same language must wee finde A diverse faction of the words and minde? Dull as I am, that hugg'd such emptie ayre, And never mark't the deede (a phrase more faire, More trusty and univocall): joyne well Three or foure actions, we may quickly spell A hollow hart: if those no light can lend Read the whole sentence, and observe the end: I will not wayte so long: the guilded man On whom I ground my speech, no longer can Delude my sense; nor can the gracefull arte Of kind dissembling button upp his hart. His well-spoke wrongs are such as hurtfull words Writt in a comely hand; or bloody swords Sheath'd upp in velvett; if hee draw on mee My armour proofe is incredulity. ON GRAY EYES Looke how the russet morne exceeds the night, How sleekest Jett yields to the di'monds light, So farr the glory of the gray-bright eye Out-vyes the black in lovely majesty. A morning mantl'd with a fleece of gray Laughs from her brow and shewes a spotlesse day: This di'mond-like doth not his lustre owe To borrowed helpe, as black thinges cast a show, It needs noe day besides itselfe, and can Make a Cimmeria seeme meridian: Light sees, tis seen, tis that whereby wee see When darknesse in the opticke facultie Is but a single element: then tell Is not that eye the best wherein doth dwell More plenteous light? that organ is divine, And more than eye that is all chrystalline, All rich of sight: oh that perspicuous glasse That lets in light, and lets a light forth passe Tis Lustre's thoroughfare where rayes doe thronge, A burning glasse that fires the lookers-on. Black eies sett off coarse beauties which they grace But as a beard smutch'd on a swarthy face. Why should the seat of life be dull'd with shade, Or that be darke for which the day was made? The learned Pallas, who had witt to choose, And power to take, did other eyes refuse, And wore the gray: each country painter blotts His goddesse eyeballs with two smutty spotts. Corruption layes on blacke; give me the eye Whose lustre dazles paynt and poetrie, That's day unto itselfe; which like the sun Seemes all one flame. They that his beames will shun Here dye like flyes: when eyes of every kind Faint at the sun, at these the sun growes blind, And skipps behind a cloud, that all may say The Eye of all the world loves to be gray. ON A GENTLEWOMAN'S WATCH THAT WANTED A KEY Thou pretty heav'n whose great and lesser spheares With constant wheelings measure hours and yeares Soe faithfully that thou couldst solve the doubt Of erring Time if Nature should be out, Where's thy intelligence? thy Soule? the Key That gives thee Life and Motion? must thou stay Thus cramp'd with rusty Sloth? and shall each wheele Disorganis'd confess it is but steele? Art's Living Creature, is thy thread all spent? Thy Pulse quite dead? hath Time a period sent To his owne Sister? slaine his Eeven Match? That when we looke 'tis doomesday by the Watch. Prithee sweete Watch be marri'd, joyne thy side Unto an active key, and then abide A frequent screwing, till successively More and more Time beget Eternity. Knowe as a Woman never lock'd and key'd Once in twice twelve growes faint and is downe-weighed From Nature's full intent, and cannot live Beyond her natural span, unlesse Man give His vanish'd bone a quick'ning, unless Man Doe adde an Ell unto her now shrunk span, Unless he lengthen out posteritie Her secret orbes will faint and She all die; Soe will thy wheeles decay, and finde their date Unless a Key their houres doe propagate: Then gett a key and live; my life Ile gage Each minute then shall grow into an age; Then lett thy Mistresse looking smile on Thee, And say 'tis time my Watch and I agree. A WATCH SENT HOME TO MRS. ELIZ: KING, WRAPT IN THEIS VERSES Goe and count her better houres; They more happie are than ours. The day that gives her any blisse Make it as long againe as tis: The houre shee smiles in lett it bee By thy art increas'd to three: But if shee frowne on thee or mee Know night is made by her not thee: Bee swift in such an houre, and soon Make it night though it bee noone: Obey her tymes, who is the free Fayre sun that governes thee and mee. ON A WATCH MADE BY A BLACKSMITH A Vulcan and a Venus seldom part. A blacksmith never us'd to filinge art Beyond a lock and key, for Venus' sake Hath cut a watch soe small that sence will ake In searching every wire, and subtile sphere Which his industrious skill hath order'd theire: It scarce outswells a nut, and is soe light A Ladies eare might well indure the weight. Twas for a Mistrisse: pitty not his owne, And yet not pitty when her worth is knowne, Or els his love that ownes her: Either's name Is carv'd within the plates: the witty frame Hath made their letters kiss for them, while they Have like the watch one pulse, one sympathy. ON A GENTLEWOMAN THAT SUNG AND PLAY'D UPON A LUTE Be silent you still musique of the Sphears, And every sense make haste to be all ears, And give devout attention to her aires, To which the Gods doe listen as to prayers Of pious votaries; the which to heare Tumult would be attentive, and would swear To keep lesse noise at Nile, if there she sing, Or with a happy touch grace but the string. Among so many auditors, such throngs Of Gods and men that presse to hear her songs, O let me have an unespied room, And die with such an anthem ore my tomb. UPON THE BLUSH OF A FAIRE LADIE Stay lusty blood! where canst thou seeke So blest a seat as in her cheeke? How dar'st thou from her face retire Whose beauty doth command desire? But if thou wilt not stay, then flowe Downe to her panting pappes belowe: There take thou glory to distayne With azure blewe each swelling veyne, From thence run boyling through each part Till thou hast warm'd her frozen hart, Which, if from love thou find'st entire, O martyr it with gentle fire. ON A GENTLEWOMAN WALKING IN THE SNOWE I saw faire Cloris walke alone Where feather'd rayne came softly downe, And Jove descended from his tower To court her in a silver shower; The wanton snowe flewe to her breast Like little birds into their nest, And overcome with whiteness there For greife it thaw'd into a teare, Thence falling on her garment's hemme For greife it freez'd into a gemme. ON CHLORIS STANDING BY THE FIRE Faire Chloris, standing by the Fire, An amorous coale with hot desire Leapt on her breast, but could not melt The chaste snow there—which when it felt For shame it blusht; and then it died There where resistance did abide, And lest she should take it unkind Repentant ashes left behind. TO A VALENTINE Faire Valentine, since once your welcome hand Did cull mee out wrapt in a paper band, Vouchsafe the same hand still, to shew thereby That Fortune did your will no injury: What though a knife I give, your beauty's charme Will keepe the edge from doing any harme: Wool deads the sternest blade; and will not such A weake edge turne, meeting a softer touch? A SUPERSCRIPTION ON SIR PHILIP SIDNEY'S ARCADIA, SENT FOR A TOKEN Whatever in Philoclea the fair Or the discreet Pamela figur'd are, Change but the name the virtues are your owne, And for a fiction there a truth is knowne: If any service here perform'd you see, If duty and affection paynted bee Within these leaves: may you be pleas'd to know They only shadow what I truly owe To your desart: thus I a glasse have sent Which both myself and you doth represent. POSIES BRACELETS This keepes my hands From Cupid's bands. Goe, keepe that hand From Hymen's band. Silke though thou bee More soft is hee/shee That weareth thee. Vouchsafe my prisoners thus to bee— Hee/Shee's faster bound that sent it thee. When you putt on this little band Think then I take you by the hand, AN EARE-STRINGE 'Tis vayne to add a ring or gemme, Your eare itselfe outpasseth them. When idle words are passing here, I warne and pull you by the eare. This silken chayne stands wayting here For golden tongues to tye on there. Here silken twynes, there locks you see— Now tell me which the softer bee? A WATCH-STRING Tyme's picture here invites your eyes, See with how running wheeles it flyes! These strings can do what no man could— The tyme they fast in prison hold. A PURSE-STRING We hugg, imprison, hang, and save, This foe, this friend, our Lord, our slave. While thus I hang, you threatned see The fate of him that stealeth mee. A NECKLACE These veines are nature's nett, These cords by art are sett. If love himselfe flye here, Love is intangled here. Loe! on my neck this twist I bind, For to hang him that steales my mynde: Unless hee hang alive in chaynes I hang and dye in lingring paynes. Theis threads enjoy a double grace, Both by the gemme and by the place. A GIRDLE Whene'er the wast makes too much hast, That hast againe makes too much wast. I here stand keeper while 'tis light, 'Tis theft to enter when 'tis night. This girdle doth the wast embrace To keepe all others from that place. This circle here is drawne about To keepe all tempting spiritts out. Whoe'er the girdle doth undoe Hee quite undoes the owner too. A PAIR OF GLOVES If that from glove you take the letter g, Then glove is love, and that I send to thee, ON THE PICTURE OF TWO DOLPHINS IN A FOUNTAYNE These dolphins twisting each on either side For joy leapt upp, and gazing there abide; And whereas other waters fish doe bring, Here from the fishes doe the waters spring, Who think it is more glorious to give Than to receive the juice whereby they live: And by this milk-white bason learne you may That pure hands you should bring or beare away, For which the bason wants no furniture, Each dolphin wayting makes his mouth an ewer, Your welcome then you well may understande When fish themselves give water to your hand. SONNETT My love and I for kisses play'd, Shee would keepe stake, I was content, But when I wonne shee would be paid; This made mee aske her what she meant. Pray, since I see (quoth shee) your wrangling vayne, Take your owne kisses, give me myne againe. TO HIS MISTRESSE In your sterne beauty I can see Whatere in Aetna wonders bee; If coales out of the topp doe flye Hott flames doe gush out of your eye; If frost lye on the ground belowe Your breast is white and cold as snowe: The sparkes that sett my hart on fire Refuse to melt your owne desire: The frost that byndes your chilly breast With double fire hath mee opprest: Both heate and cold a league have made, And leaving you they mee invade: The hearth its proper flame withstands When ice itselfe heates others hands. A LOVER TO HIS MISTRESS Ile tell you how the Rose did first grow redde, And whence the Lilly whitenesse borrowed: You blusht, and then the Rose with redde was dight: The Lillies kissde your hands, and so came white: Before that time each Rose had but a stayne, The Lilly nought but palenesse did containe: You have the native colour, these the dye; They flourish only in your livery. A RIDDLE: ON A KISS What thing is that, nor felt nor seene Till it bee given? a present for a Queene: A fine conceite to give and take the like: The giver yet is farther for to seeke; The taker doth possesse nothing the more, The giver hee hath nothing lesse in store: And given once that nature hath it still, You cannot keepe or leave it if you will: The workmanshippe is counted very small, The labour is esteemed naught at all: But to conclude, this gift is such indeede, That, if some see't 'twill make theyr hearts to bleede. ON A GENTLEWOMAN THAT HAD HAD THE SMALL POXE A Beauty smoother than the Ivory playne Late by the Poxe injuriously was slayne: Twas not the Poxe: Love shott a thousand darts, And made those pitts for graves to bury hearts: But since that Beauty hath regaynde her light, Those hearts are double slayne, it shines so bright. ON JEALOUSY There is a thing that nothing is, A foolish wanton, sober wise; It hath noe wings, noe eyes, noe eares, And yet it flies, it sees, it heares; It lives by losse, it feeds on smart, It joyes in woe, it liveth not; Yet evermore this hungry elfe Doth feed on nothing but itselfe. OF DEATH &amp; RESURRECTION. Like to the rowling of an eye, Or like a starre shott from the skye, Or like a hand upon a clock, Or like a wave upon a rock, Or like a winde, or like a flame, Or like false newes which people frame, Even such is man, of equall stay, Whose very growth leades to decay. The eye is turn'd, the starre down bendeth The hand doth steale, the wave descendeth, The winde is spent, the flame unfir'd, The newes disprov'd, man's life expir'd. Like to an eye which sleepe doth chayne, Or like a starre whose fall we fayne, Or like the shade on Ahaz watch, Or like a wave which gulfes doe snatch Or like a winde or flame that's past, Or smother'd newes confirm'd at last; Even so man's life, pawn'd in the grave, Wayts for a riseing it must have. The eye still sees, the starre still blazeth, The shade goes back, the wave escapeth, The winde is turn'd, the flame reviv'd, The newes renew'd, and man new liv'd. ON THE BIBLE. Behold this little volume here inrolde: 'Tis the Almighty's present to the world: Hearken earth's earth; each sencelesse thing can heare His Maker's thunder, though it want an eare: God's word is senior to his works, nay rather If rightly weigh'd the world may call it father; God spake, 'twas done; this great foundation Is the Creator's Exhalation Breath'd out in speaking. The best work of man Is better than his word; but if wee scanne God's word aright, his works far short doe fall; The word is God, the works are creatures all. The sundry peeces of this generall frame Are dimmer letters, all which spell the same Eternal word; But these cannot expresse His greatnesse with such easy readinesse, And therefore yeild. The Heavens shall pass away, The sun and moone and stars shall all obey To light one general bonfire; but his word, His builder-upp, his all-destroying sworde, That still survives; no jott of that can dye, Each tittle measures immortalitie. The word's owne mother, on whose breast did hang The world's upholder drawne into a span, Shee, shee was not so blest because she bare him As cause herselfe was new-born, and did hear him. Before she had brought forth she heard her Son First speaking in the Annunciation: And then, even then, before she brought forth child, By name of Blessed shee herselfe instilde. Once more this mighty word his people greets, Thus lapt and thus swath'd upp in paper sheets: Read here God's Image with a zealous eye, The legible and written Deity. ON A REGISTER FOR THE BIBLE I am the faythfull deputy Unto your fading memory. Your Index long in search doth hold; Your folded wrinkles make books olde: But I the Scripture open plaine, And what you heard soone teach againe: By mee the Welchman well may bring Himselfe to Heaven in a string. ANOTHER [I, your memories recorder] I, your memories recorder, Keepe my charge in watchfull order: My strings divide the word aright, Pressing the text both day and night: And what the hand of God hath writt Behold my fingers poynt at it: Nor can Saint Peter with his keyes Unlocke Heavens gate so soone as these. ANTHEM FOR GOOD FRYDAY See sinfull soul thy Saviours suffering see, His Blessed hands and feet fix't fast to tree: Observe what Rivulets of blood stream forth His painful pierced side, each drop more worth Than tongue of men and Angels can express: Hast to him, cursed Caitiffe, and confess All thy misdeeds, and sighing say, 'Twas I That caus'd thee thus, my Lord, my Christ, to dye. O let thy Death secure my soul from fears, And I will wash thy wounds with brinish tears: Grant me, sweet Jesu, from thy pretious store One cleansing drop, with grace to sin no more. AN ANTHEME O sing a new song to the Lord, Praise in the hight and deeper strayne; Come beare your parts with one accord, Which you in Heaven may sing againe. Yee elders all, and all the crowd That in white robes apparrell'd stands Like Saints on earth, sing out aloud, Think now the palmes are in your hands. Yee living pipes, whose stormy layes Have borrowed breath to praise our king, A well-tun'd thunder loudly raise: All that have breath his honor sing. JUSTIFICATION See how the Rainbow in the skie Seems gaudy through the Suns bright eye; Harke how an Eccho answere makes, Feele how a board is smooth'd with waxe, Smell how a glove putts on perfume, Tast how theyr sweetnesse pills assume: So by imputed Justice, Clay Seemes faire, well spoke, smooth, sweet, each way. The eye doth gaze on robes appearing, The prompted Eccho takes our hearing, The board our touch, the sent our smell, The pill our tast: Man, God as well. ON THE LIFE OF MAN What is our life? a play of passion; Our mirth the musick of division: Our mother's wombes the tyring houses bee Where wee are drest for tyme's short comedy: The earth's the stage, heaven the spectator is, Who marketh still whoere doth act amisse: Our graves that hide us from the burning sunne Are but drawne curtaynes when the play is done. ON THE DEATH OF MRS. MARY NEUDHAM As sinn makes gross the soule and thickens it To fleshy dulness, so the spotless white Of virgin pureness made thy flesh as cleere As others soules: thou couldst not tarry heere All soule in both parts: and what could it bee The Resurrection could bestow on thee, Allready glorious? thine Innocence (Thy better shroude) sent thee as pure from hence As saints shall rise: but hee whose bounty may Enlighten the greate sunn with double day, And make it more outshine itselfe than now It can the moone, shall crowne thy varnish'd brow With light above that sunn: when thou shalt bee No lower in thy place than Majesty: Crown'd with a Virgin's wreath, outshining there The Saints as much as thou did'st mortalls heere. Bee this thy hope; and whilst thy ashes ly Asleepe in death, dreame of Eternity. ON THE DEATH OF MISTRESS MARY PRIDEAUX Weep not because this childe hath dyed so yong, But weepe because yourselves have livde so long: Age is not fild by growth of time, for then What old man lives to see th' estate of men? Who sees the age of grande Methusalem? Ten years make us as old as hundreds him. Ripenesse is from ourselves: and then wee dye When nature hath obteynde maturity. Summer and winter fruits there bee, and all Not at one time, but being ripe, must fall. Death did not erre: your mourners are beguilde; She dyed more like a mother than a childe. Weigh the composure of her pretty partes: Her gravity in childhood; all her artes Of womanly behaviour; weigh her tongue So wisely measurde, not too short nor long; And to her youth adde some few riches more, She tooke upp now what due was at threescore. She livde seven years, our age's first degree; Journeys at first time ended happy bee; Yet take her stature with the age of man, They well are fitted: both are but a span. ON THE SAME M. M. P. Sleepe pretty one: oh sleepe while I Sing thee thy latest Lullaby: And may my song be but as shee, Nere was sweeter Harmonie: Thou werte all musicke: all thy limbes Were but so many well sett hymnes To prayse thy Maker. In thy browe I read thy soule, and and know not how To tell which whiter was or smoother, Or more spotlesse, one or th' other. Noe jarre, no harshnesse in thee: all Thy passions were at peace: noe gall, No rough behaviour; but even such In disposition as in touch. Yet Heaven, poore Soule, was harsh to thee: Death usde thee not halfe orderly: If thou must needs goe, must thy way Needs be by torture? must thy Day Ende in the Morning? and thy Night Come with such horrour and affright? Death might have ceizd thee gentlyer, and Embrac'te thee with a softer hand. Thou werte not sure so loath to goe That thou needst be dragged so, For thou wert all obedience, and hadst witt To doe Heaven's will and not dispute with it. Yet twere a heard heart, a dead eye That sighlesse, tearlesse, could stand by, While thy poore Mother felt each groane As much as ere shee did her owne When shee groan'd for thee: and thy cries Marrde not our eares more than her Eyes. Yet if thou tookst some truce with payne, Then was shee melted more againe To heare thy sweete words, whilst thy breath Faintly did strive to sweeten Death, Calldst for the Musicke of thy knell, And crydst, 'twas It must make thee well: Thus whilst your prayers were at strife, Thine for thy death, Hers for thy life, Thine did prevayle, and on theyr wings Mounted thy soul; where now it sings, And never shall complayne no more, But for not being there before. CONSOLATORIUM, AD PARENTES Lett her parents then confesse That they beleeve her happinesse, Which now they question. Thinke as you Lent her the world, Heaven lent her you: And is it just then to complayne When each hath but his owne againe? Then thinke what both your glories are In her preferment: for tis farre Nobler to gett a Saint, and beare A childe to Heaven than an Heyre To a large Empire. Thinke beside Shee dyde not yong, but livde a Bride. Your best wishes for her good Were but to see her well bestowde: Was shee not so? Shee marryed to The heyre of all things: who did owe Her infant Soule, and bought it too. Nor was shee barren: markt you not Those pretty little Graces, that Play'd round about her sicke bedde; three Th' eldst Faith, Hope, &amp; Charity. Twere pretty bigge ones, and the same That cryde so on theyr Fathers name. The yongst is gone with Her: the two Eldest stay to comfort you, And little though they bee, they can Master the biggest foes of man. Lastly thinke that Hir abode With you was some fewe years boarde; After hir marriage: now shee's gone Home, royally attended on: And if you had Elisha's sight To see the number of her bright Attendants thither; or Paul's rapt sprite To see her Welcome there; why then, Wish if you could Her here agen. Ime sure you could not: but all passion Would loose itselfe in admiration, And strong longings to be there Where, cause shee is, you mourn for Her. HER EPITAPH Happy Grave, thou dost enshrine That which makes thee a rich mine: Remember yet, 'tis but a loane; And wee must have it back, Her owne, The very same; Marke mee, the same: Thou canst not cheat us with a lame Deformed Carcase; Shee was fayre, Fresh as Morning, sweete as Ayre: Purer than other flesh as farre As other Soules than Bodies are: And that thou mayst the better see To finde her out: two stars there bee Eclipsed now; uncloude but those And they will poynt thee to the Rose That dyde each cheeke, now pale and wan, But will bee when shee wakes againe Fresher than ever: And howere Her long sleepe may alter Her Her Soule will know her Body streight, Twas made so fitt for't. Noe deceite Can suite another to it: none Cloath it so neatly as its owne. ON THE DEATH OF SIR THO: PELTHAM Meerly for man's death to mourne Were to repine that man was borne. When weake old age doth fall asleepe Twere foule ingratitude to weepe: Those threads alone should pull out tears Whose sodayne cracke breaks off some years. Heere tis not so: full distance heere Sunders the cradle from the beere. A fellow-traveller he hath beene So long with Time: so worne to skinne, That were hee not just now bereft, His Body first his soule had left, Threescore and tenne is Nature's date, Our journey when wee come in late. Beyond that time the overplus Was granted not to him, but us. For his own sake the Sun nere stood, But only for the peoples good. Even so his breath held out by aire Which poore men uttered in theyr prayer: And as his goods were lent to give, So were his dayes that they might live, Soe ten years more to him were told Enough to make another olde. O that Death would still doe soe; Or else on good men would bestow That wast of years which unthrifts fling Away by theyr distempering, That some might thrive by this decay As well as that of land and clay. 'Twas now well done: no cause to moane On such a seasonable stone. Where death is but an Host, we sinne Not bidding welcome to his Inne. Sleepe, sleepe, thy rest, good man, embrace; Sleepe, sleepe, th' ast trode a weary race. ON THE DEATH OF A TWIN Where are yee now, Astrologers, that looke For petty accidents in Heavens booke? Two Twins, to whom one Influence gave breath, Differ in more than Fortune, Life and Death. While both were warme (for that was all they were Unlesse some feeble cry sayd Life was there:) By wavering change of health they seem'd to trie Which of the two should live, for one must die. As if one Soule, allotted to susteine The lumpe, which afterwards was cutt in twain, Now servde them both: whose limited restraynt From double vertue made them both to faynt: But when that common Soule away should flie, Death killing one, expected both should die: Shee hitt, and was deceivde: that other parte Went to supply the weake survivers heart: So Death, where shee was cruell, seemde most milde: She aymed at two, and killde but halfe a childe. ON THE YONG BARONETT PORTMAN DYING OF AN IMPOSTUME IN'S HEAD Is Death so cunning now that all her blowe Aymes at the heade? Doth now her wary Bowe Make surer worke than heertofore? The steele Slew warlike heroes onely in the heele. New found out slights, when men themselves begin To be theyr proper Fates by new found sinne. Tis cowardize to make a wound so sure; No Art in killing where no Art can cure. Was it for hate of learning that she smote This upper shoppe where all the Muses wrought? Learning shall crosse her drift, and duly trie All wayes and meanes of immortalitie. Because her heade was crusht, doth shee desire Our equall shame? In vayne she doth aspire. No: noe: Wee know where ere shee make a breach Her poysened Sting onely the Heele can reach. Looke on the Soule of man, the very Heart; The Head itselfe is but a lower parte: Yet hath shee straynde her utmost tyranny, And done her worst in that she came so high. Had she reservde this stroke for haughty men, For politique Contrivers; justly then The Punishment were matcht with the offence: But when Humility and Innocence So indiscreetly in the Heade are hitt, Death hath done Murther, and shall die for itt: Thinke it no Favour showne because the Braine Is voyde of sence, and therefore free from payne. Thinke it noe kindness when so stealingly He rather seemde to jest away than die, And like that Innocent, the Widdows childe Cryde out, My head, my head: and so it dyde. Thinke it was rather double cruelty, Slaughter intended on his Name, that Hee Whose thoughts were nothing taynted, nothing vayne, Might seeme to hide Corruption in his brayne. How easy might this Blott bee wipte away If any Pen his worth could open lay? For which those Harlott-prayses, which wee reare In common dust, as much too slender are As great for others. Boasting Elegies Must here bee dumbe. Desert that overweighs All our Reward stoppes all our Prayse: lest wee Might seeme to give alike to Them and Thee: Wherfore an humble Verse, and such a strayne As mine will hide the truth while others fayne. ON THE DEATH OF DR. LANCTON PRESIDENT OF MAUDLIN COLLEGE When men for injuryes unsatisfy'd, For hopes cutt off, for debts not fully payd, For legacies in vain expected, mourne Over theyr owne respects within the urne, Races of tears all striveing first to fall As frequent are as eye and funerall; Then high swolne sighes drawne in and sent out strong Seeme to call back the soule or goe along. Goodness is seldome such a theam of woe Unless to her owne tribe some one or two; But here's a man, (alas a shell of man!) Whose innocence, more white than silver swan, Now finds a streame of teares; such perfect greif That in the traine of mourners hee is cheife Who lives the greatest gainer; and would faine Bee now prefer'd unto his loss againe. The webb of nerves with subtill branches spred Over the little world, are in theyr head Scarce so united as in him were knitt All his dependants: Hee that strives to sitt So lov'd of all must bee a man as square As vertues selfe; which those that fly and feare Can never hate. How seldome have we seene Such store of flesh joyn'd with so little sin? His body was not greater than his soule, Whose limbs were vertues able to controule All grudg of sloth: and as the body's weight Hal'd to the centre; so the soule as light Heav'd upward to her goale. This civill jarre Could not hold out, but made them part as farre As earth and heaven: from whence the one shall come To make her mate more fresh, less cumbersome. After so sound a sleepe, so sweet a rest, And both shall then appeare so trimly drest As freinds that goe to meet: the body shall Then seeme a soule, the soule Angellicall: A beautious smile shall passe from that to this, The joyning soule shall then the body kisse With its owne lipps: so great shall be the store Of joy and love that now thei'l part no more; Such hope hath dust! besides which happines Death hath not made his earthly share the lesse, Or quite bereft him of his honors here, But added more; for liveing hee did steere The fellowes only; but since hee is dead Hee's made a president unto theyr head. ON DR. LANCTON'S DEATH Because of fleshly mould wee bee Subject unto mortality, Let noe man wonder at his death, More flesh he had, and then lesse breath. But if you question how he died, 'Twas not the fall of swelling pride; 'Twas noe ambition to ascend Heaven in humility: his end Assur'd us that his God did make This peece for our example's sake. Had you but seene him in his way To Church, his last blest Sabbath day; His struggling soule did make such hast As if each breath would bee his last. Each bricke hee trod on, shrinking strove To make his grave and shew its love. O how his sweating body wept Knowing how soone it should bee swept In mould: but while hee kneels to pray His weighty members long to stay; Each word doth bring a breathlesse teare As if he'd leave his spirit there. Hee gone, looks back, as if to see The place where he should buried bee, Bowing as if hee did desire At the same time for to expire: Which being done, he long shall dwell Within the place hee lov'd so well, Where night and morning hundreds come A Pilgrimage unto his tomb. ON THE DEATH OF SIR THOMAS LEA You that affright with lamentable notes The servants from their beef, whose hungry throats Vex the grume porter's surly conscience: That blesse the mint for coyning lesse than pence: You whose unknown and meanly payd desarts Begge silently within, and knocke at hearts: You whose commanding worth makes men beleeve That you a kindnesse give when you receave: All sorts of them that want, your tears now lend: A House-keeper, a Patron, and a Friend Is lodged in clay. The man whose table fedde So many while he lived, since hee is dead, Himselfe is turn'd to food: whose chimney burn'd So freely then, is now to ashes turn'd. The man which life unto the Muses gave Seeks life of them, a lasting Epitaph: And hee from whose esteeme all vertues found A just reward, now prostrate in the ground, (Like some huge ancient oake, that ere it fell, Could not be measur'd by the rule so well) Desires a faythfull comment on his dayes, Such as shall neither lye to wrong or prayse: But oh! what Muse is halfe so pure, so strong, What marble sheets can keepe his name so long As onely hee hath lived? then who can tell A perfect story of his living well? The noble fire that spur'd and whetted on His bravely vertuous resolution Could not so soone be quencht as weaker soules Whose feebler sparke an ach or thought controuls. His life burnt to the snuffe; a snuffe that needs No socket to conceale the stench, but feeds Our sence like costly fumes: his manly breath Felt no disease but age; and call'd for Death Before it durst intrude, or thought to try That strength of limbs, that soules integrity. Looke on his silver hayres, his graceful browe, And Gravity itselfe might Lea avowe Her father: Time, his schoolmate. Fifty years Once wedlocke he embrac't: a date that bears Fayre scope, if Soule and Body chance to bee So long a couple as his wife and hee. But number you his deeds, they so outpasse The largest size of any mortal glasse, That though hee liv'd a thousand, some would crye Alas! he dyde in his minority. His dayes and deeds would nere be counted even Without Eternity, which now is given. Such descants poore men make; who miss him more Than sixe great men, that keeping house before After a spurt unconstantly are fledd Away to London. But the man that's dead Is gone unto a place more populous, And tarries longer there, and waites for us. AN EPITAPH ON SR JOHN WALTER, LORD CHEIFE BARON Farewell Example, Living Rule farewell; Whose practise shew'd goodness was possible, Who reach'd the full outstretch'd perfection Of Man, of Lawyer, and of Christian. Suppose a Man more streight than Reason is, Whose grounded Habit could not tread amisse Though Reason slepd; a Man who still esteem'd His wife his Bone; who still his children deem'd His Limbes and future Selfe; Servants trayn'd friends; Lov'd his Familiars for Themselves not ends: Soe wise and Provident that dayes orepast He ne're wish'd backe again; by whose forecast Time's Locke, Time's Baldness, Future Time were one, Since nought could mende nor marre one Action, That man was He. Suppose an Advocate In whose all-conquering tong true right was Fate; That could not pleade among the grounded throng Wrong Causes right nor rightfull causes wrong, But made the burnish'd Truth to shine more bright Than could the witnesses or Act in sight. Who did soe breifely, soe perspicuously Untie the knots of darke perplexity That words appear'd like thoughts, and might derive To dull Eares Knowledge most Intuitive. A Judge soe weigh'd that Freinde and one of Us Were heard like Titius and Sempronius. All Eare, no Eie, noe Hande; oft being par'd The Eies Affections and the Hands Reward. Whose Barre and Conscience were but two in Name, Sentence and Closet-Censure still the Same: That Advocate, that judge was He. Suppose A sound and setled Christian, not like those That stande by fitts, but of that Sanctity As by Repentence might scarce better'd be: Whose Life was like his latest Houre, whose way Outwent the Journey's Ende where others stay: Who slighted not the Gospel for his Lawe, But lov'd the Church more than the Bench, and sawe That all his Righteousnes had yet neede fee One Advocate beyond himselfe. 'Twas He. To this Good Man, Judge, Christian, now is given Faire Memory, noe Judgment, and blest Heaven. REMEMBRANCES OF THE RENOWNED KNIGHT, SIR ROWLAND COTTON, OF BELLAPORT IN SHROPSHIRE, CONCERNING HIS AGILITY OF BODY, TONGUE, AND MIND Renowned Champion full of wrestling Art, And made for victory in every part, Whose active Limbes, oyl'd Tongue, and vertuous Mind, Subdu'd both Foe and Friend, the Rough and Kind, Yea, ev'n Thy-selfe, and thy Diseases too, And all but Death (which won with much adoe And shall at last be vanquish'd,) where are now Those brawny Armes that crush'd the Dane? and how Doe all thy Languages to Silence turne? Babel's undifferenc'd by the speechlesse Urne. What use of Wisedome now to mold the state Where All are Equall? to appease debate Where All doe sleepe? sowre dangers to fore-fend When Spite hath done her worst and dangers end? Had Death a Body, like the Dane's or thine, Th' adst beene Her death; if humane Eares like mine, Thy tongues had charm'd them; if a heart to love, Each quality of thine a dart might prove. One Beame thou living hadst of Eminence, And still in Use, left heere and carried hence, Immortall Love; as busie now as then; There fixt on God yet heere intwin'd with Men; That makes Thee pray for Us, Us write for Thee, Joynes Heaven and Earth in one Fraternity. Love sayes thy Fall's not desparate: a Fall? That hopes for Rising. Waite but for a Call, And thou shalt rise, summon'd with Champion sound, Antæus-like, more strong from under Ground. ON THE DEATH OF SIR ROWLAND COTTON SECONDING THAT OF SIR ROBERT More Cottons yet? O let not envious Fate Attempt the Ruine of our growing State. O had it spar'd Sir Rowland, then might wee Have almost spar'd Sir Robert's Library. His Life and th' others bookes taught but the same; Death kils us twice in blotting twice one Name. Give Him, and take those Reliques with consent; Sir Rowland was a Living Monument. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LADY PENELOPE DOWAGER OF THE LATE VIS-COUNT BAYNING Great Lady, Humble partners of like griefe In bringing Comfort may deserve beliefe, Because they Feele and Feyne not: Thus we say Unto Ourselves, Lord Bayning, though away, Is still of Christ-Church; somewhat out of sight, As when he travel'd, or did bid good night, And was not seen long after; now he stands Remov'd in Worlds, as heretofore in Lands; But is not lost. The spight of Death can never Divide the Christian, though the Man it sever. The like we say to You: He's still at home, Though out of reach; as in some upper roome, Or Study: for his Place is very high, His Thought is Vision; now most properly Return'd he's Yours as sure, as e're hath been The jewell in Your Cask, safe though unseen. You know that Friends have Eares as well as Eyes, We heare Hee's well and Living, that well dies. ON THE DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORD VISCOUNT BAYNING Though after Death, Thanks lessen into Praise, And Worthies be not crown'd with gold, but bayes; Shall we not thank? To praise Thee all agree; We Debtors must out doe it, heartily. Deserved Nobility of True Descent, Though not so old in Thee grew Ancient: We number not the Tree of Branched Birth, But genealogie of Vertue, spreading forth To many Births in value. Piety, True Valour, Bounty, Meeknesse, Modesty, These noble off-springs swell Thy Name as much, As Richards, Edwards, three, foure, twenty such: For in thy Person's linage surnam'd are The great, the good, the wise, the just, the faire. One of these stiles innobles a whole stemme; If all be found in One, what race like him! Long stayres of birth, unlesse they likewise grow To higher vertue, must descend more low. When water comes through numerous veins of lead, 'Tis water still; Thy blood, from One pipe's head, Grew Aqua-vitæ streight, with spirits fill'd, As not traduc'd, but rais'd, sublim'd, distill'd. Nobility farre spread, I may behold, Like the expanded skie, or dissolv'd gold, Much rarified; I see't contracted here Into a starre, the strength of all the spheare; Extracted like the Elixir from the mine, And highten'd so that 'tis too soone divine. Divinity continues not beneath; Alas nor He; but though He passe by death, He that for many liv'd, gaines many lives After hee's dead: Each friend and servant strives To give him breath in praise; this Hospital, That Prison, Colledge, Church, must needs recall To mind their Patron; whose rich legacies In forreigne lands, and under other skies To them assign'd, shew that his heart did even In France love England, as in England Heaven: Heav'n well perceiv'd this double pious love, Both to his Country here, and that above: Therefore the day, that saw Him landed here, Hath seen him landed in his Haven there; The selfe-same day (but two yeares interpos'd) Saw Sun and Him round shining twice &amp; clos'd. No Citizen so covetous could be Of getting wealth, as of bestowing, He; His Body and Estate went as they came, Stript of Appendix Both, and left the same But in th' Originall; Necessity Devested one, the other Charity. It cost him more to clothe his soule in death, Than e're to cloth his flesh for short-liv'd breath; And whereas Lawes exact from Niggards dead A Portion for the Poore, they now are said To moderate His Bounty; never such Was known but once, that men should give too much: A Tabernacle then was built, and now The like in heav'n is purchas'd: Learn you how; Partly by building Men, and partly by Erecting walls, by new-found Chymistry, Turning of Gold to Stones. Our Christ-Church Pile, Great Henrie's Monument, shall grow awhile With Bayning's Treasure; who a way hath took. Like those at Westminster, to fill a nook 'Mongst beds of Kings. Thus speak, speak while we may For Stones will speak when We are hush'd in Clay. W. STRODE, D.D. Canon of Ch. C. ON THE DEATH OF LADIE CÆSAR Though Death to good men be the greatest boone, I dare not think this Lady dyde so soone. She should have livde for others: Poor mens want Should make her stande, though she herselfe should faynt. What though her vertuous deeds did make her seeme Of equall age with old Methusalem? Shee should have livde the more, and ere she fell Have stretcht her little Span unto an Ell. May wee not thinke her in a sleep or sowne, Or that shee only tries her bedde of grounde? Besides the life of Fame, is shee all deade? As deade as Vertue, which together fledde: As dead as men without it: and as cold As Charity, that long ago grewe old. Those eyes of pearle are under marble sett, And now the Grave is made the Cabinett. Tenne or an hundred doe not loose by this, But all mankinde doth an Example misse. A little earth cast upp betweene her sight And us eclypseth all the world with night. What ere Disease, to flatter greedy Death, Hath stopt the organ of such harmlesse breath, May it bee knowne by a more hatefull name Then now the Plague: and for to quell the same May all Physitians have an honest will: May Pothecaries learne the Doctors skill: May wandring Mountebanks, and which is worse May an old womans medicine have the force To vanquish it, and make it often flie, Till Destiny on's servant learne to die. May death itselfe, and all its Armory Bee overmatcht with one poore Recipe. What need I curse it? for, ere Death will kill Another such, so farre estrang'd from ill, So fayre, so kinde, so wisely temperate, Time will cutt off the very life of Fate. To make a perfect Lady was espyde No want in her of anything but Pride: And as for wantonnesse, her modesty Was still as coole as now her ashes bee. Seldome hath any Daughter lesse than her Favourde the stampe of Eve her grandmother. Her soule was like her body; both so cleare As that a brighter eye than mans must peere To finde a Blott; nor can wee yet suspect But only by her Death the least defect: And were not that the wages due to Sinne Wee might beleeve that spotlesse she had bin. AN EPITAPH ON MR. FISHBORNE THE GREAT LONDON BENEFACTOR, AND HIS EXECUTOR What are thy gaines, O death, if one man ly Stretch'd in a bed of clay, whose charity Doth hereby get occasion to redeeme Thousands out of the grave: though cold hee seeme He keepes those warme that else would sue to thee, Even thee, to ease them of theyr penury. Sorrow I would, but cannot thinke him dead, Whose parts are rather all distributed To those that live; His pitty lendeth eyes Unto the blind, and to the cripple thighes, Bones to the shatter'd corps, his hand doth make Long armes for those that begg and cannot take: All are supply'd with limbs, and to his freind Hee leaves his heart, the selfe-same heart behind; Scarce man and wife so much one flesh are found As these one soule; the mutuall ty that bound The first prefer'd in heav'n to pay on earth Those happy fees which made them strive for death, Made them both doners of each others store, And each of them his own executor: Those hearty summes are twice confer'd by either, And yet so given as if confer'd by neither. Lest some incroching governour might pare Those almes and damne himselfe with pooremens share, Lameing once more the lame, and killing quite Those halfe-dead carcases, by due foresight His partner is become the hand to act Theyr joynt decree, who else would fain have lackt This longer date that so hee might avoyd The praise wherewith good eares would not be cloy'd, For praises taint our charity, and steale From Heav'ns reward; this caus'd them to conceale Theyr great intendment till the grave must needs Both hide the Author and reveale the deeds. His widdow-freind still lives to take the care Of children left behind; Why is it rare That they who never tied the marriage knott, And but good deeds no issue ever gott, Should have a troupe of children? All mankind Beget them heyres, heyres by theyr freinds resign'd Back into nature's keepeinge. Th' aged head Turn'd creeping child of them is borne and bredd; The prisons are theyr cradles where they hush Those piercing cryes. When other parents blush To see a crooked birth, by these the maim'd Deform'd weake offcasts are sought out and claim'd To rayse a Progeny: before on death Thus they renew mens lives with double breath, And whereas others gett but halfe a man Theyr nobler art of generation can Repayr the soule itselfe, and see that none Bee cripled more in that then in a bone, For which the Cleargy being hartned on Weake soules are cur'd in theyr Physition, Whose superannuat hatt or threadbare cloake Now doth not make his words so vainly spoke To people's laughter: this munificence At once hath giv'n them ears, him eloquence. Now Henryes sacriledge is found to bee The ground that sets off Fishborne's charity, Who from lay owners rescueing church lands, Buys out the injury of wrongfull hands, And shewes the blackness of the other's night By lustre of his day that shines so bright. Sweet bee thy rest until in heav'n thou see Those thankefull soules on earth preserv'd by thee, Whose russet liv'ryes shall a Robe repay That by reflex makes white the milky way. Then shall those feeble limbs which as thine owne Thou here didst cherish, then indeed bee known To bee thy fellow limbs, all joyn'd in one; For temples here renew'd the corner stone Shall yeild thee thanks, when thou shall wonder at The churches glory, but so poore of late, Glad of thy almes! Because thy tender eare Was never stop'd at cryes, it there shall heare The Angells quire. In all things thou shalt see Thy gifts were but religious Usury. ON THE DEATH OF MR. JAMES VAN OTTON The first day of this month the last hath bin To that deare soule. March never did come in So lyonlike as now: our lives are made As fickle as the weather or the shade. March dust growes plenty now, while wasting fate Strike heare to dust, well worth the proverbs rate. I could be angry with the fates that they This man of men so soone have stole away. Meane they a kingdome to undoe, or make The universe a Cripple while they take From us so cheife a part, whose art knew how To make a man a man, nor would allow Nature an Heteroclite still to remaine Irregular, but with a jugling paine Deceive men of their greife, and make them know That he could cure more than ere chance or foe Dare to instring. Death now growes politique: While Otton liv'd herselfe was weake and sicke For want of food, therefore at him she aimde Who bar'd her of her purpose. All is maimde, All's out of joint, for in this fatall crosse Behold Death's triumph and our fatall losse. ON SIR THOMAS SAVILL DYING OF THE SMALL POX Take, greedy death, a body here entomd That by a thousand stroakes was made one wound, Where all thy shafts were stuck with fatall ayme Untill a quiver this thy marke became, Had Cæsar fifty wounds to let in thee Because a troop of men might seeme to bee Comprised in that great Spirit, this had more Whose deaths were equalld with the fruitfull store Of hopefull vertues, though each wound did reach The very heart, yet none could make a breach Into his soule, a soule more fully drest With vertuous gemmes than was his body prest With hatefull spotts, and therefore every scarr When death itselfe is dead shall be a starre. EPITAPH ON MR. BRIDGEMAN One pitt containes him now that could not dye Before a thousand pitts in him did lye; Soe many spotts upon his flesh were shewne 'Cause on his soule sinne fastned almost none. TO HIS SISTER Loving Sister: every line Of your last letter was so fine With the best mettle, that the grayne Of Scrivener's pindust were but vayne: The touch of Gold did sure instill Some vertue more than did the Quill. And since you write noe cleanly hand Your token bids mee understand Mine eyes have here a remedy Wherby to reade more easily. I doe but jeast: your love alone Is my interpretation: My words I will recant, and sweare I know your hand is wondrous faire. TO SIR JO. FERRERS Gold is restorative: how can I then Choose but restore you Thanks at least? But when I weigh your meritt, and then try the Scale What correspondence I can make withall My thanks as farre beneath your worth I hold As this light pindust valued with your Gold. Gold is a mettle of most heate and weight, And well deserves like thanks, not cold nor light: But if my Thanks had so much literall And proper weight, as metaphoricall, Then should the Carryer earne his penny better, And soone might loade a Waggon with one Letter: But since they have but vertuall thanks alone Which must depende on Estimation, Accept, I pray, this Bill of thankfulnesse, In manner of a Bill: whose nature is Itselfe noe actuall substance; but doth tie To all performance in Futuritie. Some men whose Penne outruns theyr mind as farre As any Courtyers tongue may thinke they are Fayrely dischargde by theyr Confession, Like one that hath bin shrivde: 'tis ten to one But when they send theyr Thanks they send away Thankfulnesse too. True thanks, the more wee pay The more they grow at home: the Letter sent Is but an Earnest of what else is meant. Why pleade I thus against myselfe? I knowe Noe other Argument of making showe Of thankes but barren words; and this I call The Schollers treasure; and his coyne is all One stampe; Thanks good and sterling: Wee restore This for small Courtesies: we have no more To pay for greater Benefits. Then grant Your kinde Acceptance to supply this want, Untill Occasion serves mee to performe Some reall Service; when that houre is borne I shall bee fortunate: for know that still My utmost power your Tenant is at will. Meane while may all good Happ upon you shine So as it may exceed your wish and mine. Now my Apostrophe should humbly bowe To speake unto my Lady: but I know Twere but an idle Repitition To write asunder, seeing both are one: Twere prophanation of my penne and witt If I should separate what so is knitt. TO THE SAME If empty vessells can resounde Farre more than those that doe abounde, Or if a Pumpe orechargde with store, Lesse water yeelds than being poore, No wonder if my thanks so long Have Silence kept: they were too strong: My Breast untill some time were spent Was too too full to gett a vent. Had your ore-comming Bounty beene Lesse noble; had it onely seene The way to give, not give by arte, I quickly had transcribde my heart In ready phrase; and soone had payde The debt which now I have delayde. The Manner, not the Benefitt Amazde my thankes and dulld my witt. Eight golden faces closely rolde Within eight verses, did enfolde Some mystery, which thus I reade, You square alike your Word and Deede. Each verse was truly golden there, And with the Pieces numbred were: The lines so just that every one Became a new Inscription. Was't not enough my heart to binde With gifts alone; but you must finde Verses to way mee downe, and soe Stopping the way where I should goe, Prevent all thanks? I then desire In steade of thanks I may admire. Thinke how the boasting Hypocrite Setts out his gift in open sight, And guilds the outside of his deede Trading for prayse, which others neede: Then looke upon your secrecie, Your shamefacte Liberalitie, And pay yourselfe with that Reward Which Conscience onely can affoord: Such prayse the best men seeke, but you Sought to avoyde such prayses too. To say the left hand could not reade What from the right hand did proceede Were to detract: I think the hand That gave did scarcely understande Her secrett gifts: I'm sure twas so That the receiver did not knowe: Nor must I know till I were gone, That so your ears may scape my tongue. I have your Blushing therefore sparde, I have indeede; and since you fearde So to be thankt, who did not feare So to deserve: I did forbeare; I did awhile; but now I speake: To hold in still I am too weake. TO THE SAME It grieves mee that I thus due thanks retayne For that which I receivde the last King's raigne; It grieves mee that the Lent is fully past; That all the Usurers accounts are cast, Theyr use already taken: and that I Noe tribute sende, noe thankfull usury. I envy that each Tree and petty shrubs Breaking the barke peepe out with timely buds, And paying all the duties of the spring Theyr yearly Rents to Nature freely bring, Whilst I in barren Silence still remayne, Not yeelding for increase one leafe agayne, One leafe of Paper; Leaves are signes of fruit, So Words of what full time should execute: They are no more: for shall I thinke I pay When, that I am your Depter, I but say? Confession is noe payment, but with God, And some fewe of his Schollers, two or odde: Of which small number, though you would be one, Yet of such Depters I would fayne be none. Till I can choose, with patience thinke that man Who nothing pays, pays all; if what he can. TO SIR EDM. LING Sir: I had writt in Lattin: but I feare You thinke tis durty still: and then it were Unworthy of your hand. If Truth were tolde Twas cause you turnde my Lattin all to gold. But yet I hope the payment is as good In English thankes. When hardly understood Wee speake outlandish phrase, and thanks by arte, Wee speake but Tongue-deepe: now tis from the heart. May I want tongue and heart if I forgett A thing so rare, a stranger's benefitt. In writing to a Stranger, men are bent To make a flourish with nice Complement. Should I by you, as by a Stranger doe, Your gift would sweare mee downe you were not so. Yet give mee leave, Sir, but to darte one worde From that full store-house where my Thanks I horde: May every houre that travells through the glasse Number a new content before it passe: May you neere wish wherby to want true blisse, Nor ever want wherby to cause a wish. TO THE LADY KNIGHTON Madam: due thanks are lodgde within my breast As close as when your enigmatique chest Embracde the hidden Angell, which I found Like Danäe, or like to Rosamonde Wrapt in a winding labirynth. But then I thought mine eyes a prodigy had seene, Two Angells joynd in one; the first a badd one, The other good: twas Michael and the Dragon. This is the morall if wee reade it well, The selfe same Gold contains both heaven and hell: To good men tis an Angell: but the evill While they possesse it treasure upp the Divell. O may that valiant Angell, whose bright face Was figurde in your Golde, whose glory was No lesse exprest in the materiall Than in the stampe it was informde withall; May he still guard your side and where you dwell May still your Champion bee Saynt Michaëll. What though that frayle Disease long siege hath layde Unto your body? Never be dismayde. The Languisher breaths long oft times wee see: So soddayn blasts blow downe a sturdy Tree When shivering Shrubs hold out: the firme and strong Are strucke with casuall blows: the weake live long In heavenly expectation of theyr last, And fayrly pace, whilst others runne in hast. Thinke when your palsy and the night is fledde Twas part of Death; and when you rise from bed Thinke that of all your limbs, the weakest one Hath tasted of the Resurrection. Thanks was my Theame: but let me thank or pray It issues from one head, what ere I say. O, may your dayes bee all as good as long; May no ill happe or passion dare to wrong Your quiet peace with the least griefe or feare, And may your Heart keepe Christmas all the year. TO MR. RIVES UPPON HIS RECOVERY Welcome abroad, O welcome from your bedd, I joy to see you thus delivered: After fower yeares in travell, issues forth, A birth of lasting wonder, whereat truth Might well suspect herselfe; a new disease Borne to advance the Surgeons of our dayes Above all others: a perfidious bone Eaten and underminde by humours growne Lodg'd in the captive thigh, which first of any Halted, though furnisht with a bone too many. No Golgotha, nor Charnell house, nor feild, If all were searcht, could such another yeild; A bone so lockt and hugg'd in as a barr That back and forwards may be wrested farr, But not pull'd out at either hole; nor could The cunning workman come to't as hee would: Crosse veynes did guard the soare, a hollow cave Must wade into the flesh: the surgeon's grave Thus being digg'd the file with harshe delay Must grate the bone, and carve those chippes away. Blest be the midmen, whose dexteritie Pull'd out a birth, like Bacchus, from the thigh; Tutors of nature, whose well guided arte Can rectifie her wants in every part; Who by preserving others pay the debt They owe to nature, and doe re-begett Her strength growne ruinate. I could be gladd Such liv'd the dayes which they to others add. I cannot rightly tell the happier man, The patient or the surgeon; doe but scan His praise, thy ease: twas sure an Extasie That kill'd Van-Otto, not a Lethargie; Striving to crowne his worke, he mainly tryde His last and greatest case, then gladly dyde. Bernard must tarry longer, should hee flye After his brother all the world must dye, Or live a Cripple. Griffith's happie fate Requires the same hands still to itterate No lesse a miracle: the Joyners skill Could never mend his carved pate so well As hee hath heald a naturall; the stout And boasting Paracelsus who gives out His rules can give man's life eternitie Would faintly doubt of this recovery. Hee that hath wrought their cures I thinke hee can As well of scrappes make upp a perfect man. O had you seene his marrowe dropp away, Or the others brayne start out, then would you say Nothing could cure this fracture or that bone Save Bernard or the Ressurection. Stand, honest Rives, stand up and looke about, Behold thine enemie, the bone, is out: Now smile upon thy torment, pretty thing, How will you use it? Carry't in a ring Like a death's head, or send it to the grave, An earnest of the body it must have; Or if you will you may the same translate Into a dye because twas fortunate. The ring were best; tis like a Dyamond borne Out of a Rock, soe was it hewne and torne Out of your thigh: the gemme worth nothing is Untill it be cutt out, no more was this. Happie are they that knowe what treasure tis To finde lost health, they onely feele true blisse. Thou that hast felt these panges maist well mayntaine Man's greatest pleasure is but want of payne: Enjoy thyselfe, for nothing worse can come To one so schoold and versd in martyrdome. A NEW YEAR'S GIFT We are prevented; you whose Presence is A Publick New-yeares gift, a Common bliss To all that Love or Feare, give no man leave To vie a Gift but first he shall receave; Like as the Persian Sun with golden Eies First shines upon the Priest and Sacrifice. Ile on howere; May this yeare happier prove Than all the Golden Age when Vertue strove With nothing but with Vertue; may it bee Such as the Dayes of Saturnes Infancy. May every Tide and Season joyntly fitt All your Intents and your Occasions hitt: May every Grayne of Sand within your Glass Number a fresh content before it pass. And when success comes on, stand then each howre Like Josuah's Day, &amp; grow to three or fowre: At last when this yeare rounds and wheeles away, Bee still the next yeare like the old yeares Day. TO A FRIEND Like to the hande which hath bin usde to play One lesson long, still runs the usuall way, And waites not what the hearers bid it strike, But doth presume by custome, this will like: So runne my thoughts, which are so perfect growne, So well acquainted with my passion, That now they dare prevent mee with their hast, And ere I thinke to sigh my sigh is past: Tis past, and flowne to you, for you alone Are all the object that I thinke upon, And did not you supply my soule with thought For want of action it to none were brought. What though our absent armes may not enfold Reall embraces, yet wee firmely hold Each other in possession. Thus wee see The Lord enjoy his Lands where ere hee bee: If Kings possesst no more than where they sate What were they greater than a mean estate? This makes mee firmly yours, you firmly mine, That somthing more than bodies us combine. A LETTER Goe happy Paper: by command Take liberty to kisse her hand, More white than any part of thee, Although with spots thou graced bee. The glory of the clearest day, The morning ayre perfumd in May, The first borne rose of all the Spring, The downe beneath a Turtle's wing, A lute just reaching to the eare; What ere is soft, or sweete, or fayre, Are but her shreds, who fills the place And some of every single grace. As in a child the nurse descryes The mother's lippes, the father's eyes, The uncle's nose; and doth apply An owner to each part; so I In her could analyze the store Of all the Choyce ere nature bore. Each private peece to minde may call Some worth; but none can match it all. Poore emblems! they can but expresse One element of comelinesse: None are so rich to shew in one All simples of perfection: Nor can the Pencill represent More than the outward lineament. Then who can limbe the portrayture Of beauties live behavior? Or what can figure every kinde Of Jewells that adorne her minde? Thought cannot draw her picture full: Even Thought to her is grosse and dull. WITH PENNE, INKE, AND PAPER TO A DISTRESSED FRIEND Here is paper, pen, and inke, That your heart and seale may sinke Into such markes as may expresse A Soule much blest in heavinesse. May your paper seeme as fayre As yourselfe when you appeare: May the Letters which you write Looke like black eye-lids on white. May your penne such fancies bring As one new puld from Cupid's wing: That your paper, hand, and seale His favour, heart, and Soule may steale. THANKS FOR A WELCOME For your good lookes and your clarrett, For oft bidding doe not spare it: For tossing glasses to the toppe, And after sucking off a droppe, When scarce a droppe was left behinde, Or that which nicknames wine, even winde: For healthy mirth and lusty sherry Such as made old Cato merry; Such are our thanks that you may have In blood the clarrett which you gave, And in your service shall be spent The spirits which your sacke hath lent. A PARALELL BETWEEN BOWLING AND PREFERMENT Preferment, like a Game at bowles, To feede our hope with diverse play Heer quick it runnes, there soft it rowles: The Betters make and shew the way. As upper ground, so great Allies Doe many cast on theyr desire: Some uppe are thrust, and forc't to rise, When those are stopt that would aspire. Some whose heate and zeale exceed Thrive well by Rubbs that curb theyr hast Some that languish in theyr speede Are cherisht by a gentle blast. Some rest: and others cutting out The same by whome themselves were made: Some fetch a compasse farre about And secretly the marke invade. Some gett by knocke, and so advance Theyr fortune by a boystrous ayme: And some who have the sweetest chance Theyr mistresse hitt, and winne the game. The fayrest casts are those that owe No thanks to Fortunes giddy sway: Such honest men good bowles doe throw, Whose owne true Byass cutts the way. THE CAPPS The witt hath long beholden bin Unto the Cappe to keepe it in: Lett now the witt fly out amayne In prayse to quitt the Cappe againe. The Cappe that ownes the highest part Obtaynd that place by due desart: For every Cappe, what ere it bee Is still the signe of some degree. The Cappe doth stand, each head can show, Above the Crowne; but Kings below: The Cappe is neerer heaven than wee, A greater signe of majesty. When off the Cappe wee chance to take Both head and feete obeysance make: For every Cappe, &amp;c. The Munmoth cappe, the Saylors thrumme, And that wherin poore Tradesmen come, The Physick, Law, and Cappe divine, And that which crownes the Muses nine: The Cappe that Fools doth countenance, The goodly Cappe of maintenance: For every Cappe, &amp;c. The sickly Cappe both playne and wrought; The fudling Cappe, however bought; The Quilted, Furrd, the Velvet, Satin, For which so many fooles learne Latin; The Cruell Cappe, the fustian pate, The Periwigge, a Cappe of late: And every Cappe, &amp;c. The souldiers that the Munmoth weare, On castle toppes theyr ensignes reare: The Seaman with his thrumme doth stand In higher parts than all the land: The Tradesmans Cappe aloft is borne By vantage of (some say) a Horne. Thus every Cappe, &amp;c. The Physicke Cappe to dust can bring, Without controule, the greatest King: The Lawyers Cappe hath heavenly might To make a crooked action right, Which being round and endlesse knowes To make as endlesse any cause: Thus every Cappe, &amp;c. Both East and West, both North and South, Where ere the Gospell findes a mouth, The Cappe divine doth thither looke; Tis square, like Scholars and theyr booke; The rest are round, but this is square To shew theyr heads more stable are; Thus every Cappe, &amp;c. The sickly Cappe, not wrought with silke, Is like Repentance, white as milke: When hatts in Church droppe off in hast This Cappe neere leaves the head uncast: The sicke mans Cappe, thats wrought, can tell Though hee bee sicke, his state is well. Thus every Cappe, &amp;c. The fudling Cappe, god Bacchus might, Turnes night to day, and day to night: It godlike makes proud heads to bende, And lowly feete makes to ascend: It makes men richer than before By seeing double all theyr store. It rounds the world within the brayne, And makes a monarch of a swayne: The Furrd and Quilted Cappe of age Can make a mouldy Proverbe sage. Thus every Cappe, &amp;c. The Sattin and the Velvett hive Unto a Bishoprick doth drive: Nay, when a file of Caps you're seen in, A square Capp, this, and next a linnen: This triple Cappe may rayse some hope, If fortune smile, to be a Pope: For every Cappe, &amp;c. Though fustian capps bee slender weare, The head is of no better geare: The cruell Cappe is knitt, like hose For them whose zeale takes cold i'th' nose: Whose parity doth thinke it meete To cloath alike the head and feete: This Cappe would fayne, but cannot bee: The only signe of noe degree. The Periwigg, oh that declares The rise of flesh, but fall of hayres: And none but Grandos can proceede So farre in sinne that this they neede Before theyr Prince, which covered are, And only to themselves goe bare: This Cappe of all the Capps that bee Is now the signe of high degree. ON A GOOD LEGG AND FOOT If Hercules tall stature might bee guest But by his thumbe, wherby to make the rest In due proportion; the best rule that I Would choose to measure Venus' beauty by Should bee her legg and foot. If husbandmen Measure theyr timber by the foot, why then Not we our wives? Whether wee goe or stride Those native compasses are seldome wide Of telling true: the round and slender foot Is a sure index, and a secrett note Of hidden parts; and well this way may lead Unto the closett of a maydenheade: Here, Emblemes of our youth, we roses tye, And here the garter, love's deare mystery: For want of beauty here the peacock's pride Letts fall her trayne, and fearing to bee spide Shutts upp her paynted witnesses to lett Those eyes from view which are but counterfett. Who looks not if this part be good or evill May meet with cloven feet and match the divell, For this doth make the difference betweene The more unhallowed creatures and the cleane, Well may you judge her other stepps are lighte, Her thoughts awry that doth not tread aright: But then there's true perfection when wee see Those parts more absolute that hidden bee: Nature nere layd a fayre foundation For an unworthy frame to rest upon. Lett others view the topp and limbes throughout, The deeper knowledge is to know the roote: And reading of the face the weakest know, What beauty is; the learned looke below; Who, looking there, doe all the rest, descrie As in a poole the moon we use to spie: Pardon (sweetehart) the pride of my desire If but to kisse your toe it should aspire. ON JOHN DAWSON, BUTLER OF C.C. Dawson the Butler's dead: Although I think Poets were ne'er infusde with single drinke Ile spend a farthing muse; some watry verse Will serve the turne to cast upon his hearse; If any cannot weepe amongst us here Take off his pott, and so squeeze out a tear: Weepe, O his cheeses, weepe till yee bee good, Yee that are dry or in the sun have stood; In mossy coats und rusty liveries mourne, Untill like him to ashes you shall turne: Weep, O ye barrells, lett your drippings fall In trickling streams: make waste more prodigal Than when our drinke is badde, that John may flote To Styx in beere, and lift upp Charon's boate With wholesome waves. And as our conduits run With clarett at a Coronation, So lett our channells flow with single tiffe, For John, I hope, is crownde: take off your whiffe, Yee men of Rosemary: Now drinke off all, Remembring 'tis a Butler's funeral: Had he bin master of good double beere, My life for his, John Dawson had beene here. JACKE-ON-BOTH-SIDES The sections of this poem appear side by side, and the lines can be read across as well as downwards. I hold as fayth What Rome's Church sayth Where the King's head, That flock's misled Where th' Altar's drest That People's blest Who shuns the Masse Hee's but an Asse Who Charity preach They Heav'n soone reach On Fayth t'rely, 'Tis heresy What England's Church allows My Conscience disavowes; That Church can have no seame; That holdes the Pope supreme; There's service scarce divine; With table, bread and wine; Hee's Catholique and wise; Who the Communion flyes; That Church with schismes fraught; Where only fayth is taught; Noe matter for good workes, Makes Christians worse than Turkes. CHIMNEY-SWEEPER'S SONG. Hath Christmas furr'd your Chimneys, Or have the maides neglected, Doe Fire-balls droppe from your Chimney's toppe, The Pidgin is respected, Looke up with feare and horror, O how my mistresse wonders! The streete doth crie, the newes doth flie, The boyes they thinke it thunders. Then up I rush with my pole and brush, I scowre the chimney's Jacket, I make it shine as bright as mine, When I have rub'd and rak'd it. Take heed, ten groates you'le forfeit, The Maior will not have under, In vain is dung, so is your gun When brickes doe flie asunder: Let not each faggot fright ye, When threepence will me call in, The Bishopps foote is not worse than soote If ever it should fall in. Up will I rush, etc. The sent, the smoake ne're hurts me, The dust is never minded, Mine Eyes are glasse men sweare as I passe Or else I had bin blinded, For in the midst of Chimneys I laugh, I sing, I hollow, I chant my layes in Vulcan's praise As merry as the swallow. Still up I rush, etc. With Engines and devices I scale the proudest chimney, The Prince's throne to mine alone Gives place, the Starrs I climb ny. I scorne all men beneath me While there I stand a scowring, All they below looke like a Crow, Or men on Paules a tow'ring. Then downe I rush, etc. And as I downeward rumble What thinke you is my lott then? A good neat's tongue in the inside hung, The maide hath it forgotten: If e're the wanton mingled My inke with soote I wist not, Howere the neate and harmless cheate Is worth a penny, is't not? Still doe I rush, etc. Then cloth'd in soote and ashes I catch the maides that hast out, Whos'ere I meete with smutt I greete, And pounse their lipps and wastcote: But on the Sunday morning I looke not like a widgin, Soe brave I stand with a point in my bande Men ask if I be Pidgin. Yet will I rush, etc. Mulsacke I dare encounter For all his horne and feather, Ile lay him a crowne Ile roare him downe, I thinke heale ne'er come hether. The Boyes that climbe like Crickets And steale my trade, Ile strippe them, By priviledge I, growne Chimney hy, Soone out of towne will whippe them. Then will I rush, etc. A DEVONSHIRE SONG Thou ne're wutt riddle, neighbour Jan Where Ich a late ha been-a? Why ich ha been at Plymoth, Man, The leeke was yet ne're zeen-a. Zutch streetes, zutch men, zutch hugeous zeas, Zutch things with guns there tumbling. Thy zelfe leeke me thoudst blesse to see, Zutch overmonstrous grumbling. The towne orelaid with shindle stone Doth glissen like the skee-a: Brave shopps stand ope, and all yeare long I thinke a Faire there bee-a: A many gallant man there goth In gold that zaw the King-a; The King zome zweare himzelfe was there, A man or zome zutch thing-a. Voole thou that hast noe water past, But thicka in the Moore-a, To zee the zea would be agast, It doth zoe rage and roar-a: Zoe zalt it tasts thy tongue will thinke The vier is in the water; It is zoe wide noe lande is spide, Looke ne're zoe long thereafter. The Water vrom the Element None can dezeave cha vore-a, It semmeth low, yet all consent Tis higher than the Moore-a. Tis strang how looking down the Cliffe Men looke mere upward rather; If these same Eene had it not zeen Chud scarce beleeve my Vather. Amid the water woodden birds, And vlying houses zwimme-a, All vull of goods as ich have heard And men up to the brimm-a: They venter to another world Desiring to conquier-a, Vor which their guns, vowle develish ons, Doe dunder and spitt vier-a. Good neighbour Tom, how farre is that? This meazell towne chill leave-a; Chill mope noe longer here, that's vlatt To watch a Sheepe or Sheare-a: Though it as varre as London be, Which ten mile ich imagin, Chill thither hie for this place I Doe take in greate indudgin. UPON THE SHERIFFS BEERE The Sheriffe of Oxford late is grown so wise As to repreive his Beere till next assize: Alas! twas not so quick, twas not so heady, The Jury sate and found it dead already. LOVE COMPARED TO A GAME OF TABLES Love is a game at tables where the dye Of mayds affections doth by fancie fly: If once you catch their fancie in a blott It's tenne to one if then you enter not: You being a gamester then may boldly venter, And if you finde the point lye open enter: But marke them well, for by false playing then, Doe what you can they will be bearing men. ON A BUTCHER MARRYING A TANNER'S DAUGHTER A fitter match hath never bin— The flesh is married to the skinne. EPITAPHES ON THE MONUMENT OF SIR WILLIAM STRODE Tread soft, for if you wake this Knight alone, You raise an Hoast: Religions Champion, His Cuntreys Staffe, Rights bold Distributer, His Neighbours Guard, the Poor mans Almoner, Who dyes with Works about him, as did He, Shall rise attended thus triumphantly. ON HIS LADY MARIE Marie, Incarnate Virtue, Soule and Skin Both pure, whom Death not Life convincd of Sin, Had Daughters like seven Pleiades; but She Was a prime Star of greatest Claritie. ON HIS LADY DENYS Denys hath merited no slender praise, In that She well supplied the Formers daies. Conceive how Good she was, whose very worst Unto her Knight was This, that She dyed First. DOUBTFUL PIECES A SONNETThe attribution of this poem is questionable. [Mourne, mourne, yee lovers: Flowers dying] Mourne, mourne, yee lovers: Flowers dying Live againe, the cold defying, But Beauties floure once dead dyes ever, Falls as soone, and riseth never. Mourne, mourne, yee lovers: sadly singing Love hath his Winter, and no springing. A SONNETThe attribution of this poem is questionable. [Sing aloud, harmonious sphears] Sing aloud, harmonious sphears: Let your concord reach Jove's eares. Play your old lessons ore againe, And keepe time in every strayne, For now the Gods are listning to your laies As they are passing through the milky waies. OBSEQUIESThe attribution of this poem is questionable. Draw not too neare, Unlesse you droppe a tear On this stone, Where I groane, And will weepe, Untill eternall sleepe Shall charm my weary eyes. Clora lyes heere, Embalm'd with many a teare, Which the swaines From the plaines Here have payde, And many a vestall mayde Hath mourn'd her obsequies; Their snowy breasts they teare, And rend theyr golden heare, Casting cries To celestiall dieties, To returne Her beauty from the urne, To raigne Unparaleld on earth againe: When straight a sound From the ground, Piercing the ayre Cryed Shee's dead, Her soule is fledde Unto a place most rare. You spirits that doe keepe The dust of those that sleepe Under the ground, Heare the sound Of a swaine, That folds his arms in vayne, Unto the ashes he adores. For pity do not fright Him wandering in the night: Whilst he laves Virgins graves With his eyes, Unto their memoryes Contributing sad showers: And when my name is read In the number of the dead, Some one may In Charity repay My sad soul The tribute which she gave, And howle Some requiem on my grave. Then weepe no more, Greife will not restore Her freed from care. Though she be dead, Her soul is fledde Unto a place more rare. UPON HEAVENS BEST IMAGE, HIS FAIRE AND VERTUOUS MISTRESSE, M.S.The attribution of this poem is questionable. The most insulting tyrants can but be Lords of our bodies; still our minds are free. My Mistress thralls my soul, those chains of gold, Her locks, my very thoughts infettered hold. Then sure she is a Goddesse, and if I Should worship her 'tis no Idolatry. Within her cheeks a fragrant garden lies Where Roses mixt with Lillies feast mine eyes: Here's alwayes spring, no winter to annoy Those heavenly flowers, onely some tears of joy Doe water them, and sure, if I be wise, This garden is another Paradice. Her eyes two heavenly lamps, whose ordered motion Swayes all my senses, reason, and devotion; And yet those beams did then most glorious shine When passions dark had mask'd this soul of mine: Now if the night her glory best declare, What can I deem them but a starry paire. Her brow is vertues court, where she alone Triumphants sits in faultlesse beauties throne: Did you but mark its purenesse you would swear Diana's come from Heaven to sojourne there: Onely this Cynthia dims not even at noon, There wants a man (methinks) in such a Moone. Her breath is great Jove's incense, sweeter far Then all Arabian winds &amp; spices are; Her voice the sphear's best musick, &amp; those twins Her armes, a precious paire of Cherubs wings. In briefe she is a map of Heaven, &amp; there O would that I a constellation were. ON HIS MISTRESSEThe attribution of this poem is questionable. Gaze not on swans in whose soft breast A full hatcht beauty seems to rest, Nor snow which falling from the sky Hovers in its virginity. Gaze not on roses though new blown Grac'd with a fresh complexion, Nor lilly which no subtle bee Hath rob'd by kissing chemistry. Gaze not on that pure milky way Where night vies splendour with the day, Nor pearls whose silver walls confine The riches of an Indian mine: For if my emperesse appears Swans moultring dy, snows melt to tears, Roses do blush and hang their heads Pale lillyes shrink into their beds; The milky way rides poast to shrowd Its baffled glory in a clowd, And pearls do climb unto her eare To hang themselves for envy there. So have I seene stars big with light, Proud lanthorns to the moone-ey'd night, Which when Sol's rays were once display'd Sunk in their sockets and decay'd. A SONGThe attribution of this poem is questionable. [As I my flocks lay keeping] As I my flocks lay keeping Mine eyes they fell a-sleeping; I wott I have neere wakte againe, For when my head I raysde I round about gazde To seeke my love, but sought in vayne. Let foulnesse now be saynted, All beauty's tainted; Since fayth she has none. I wayle, I weepe, I dye, I sleepe, In sorrowes all alone. A SONGThe attribution of this poem is questionable. [Thoughts doe not vexe me whilst I sleep] Thoughts doe not vexe me whilst I sleep, Griefe doe not thus disturbe mee: Smile not false hope, whilst that I weepe, Alas! she cannot love mee. Had I been as cold and nice, And as often turning, Then as shee had I been ice, And shee as I now burning. Tears flow no more from my sadd eyes, Sighes do not soe oppresse mee; Stoppe not your ears at these my cryes, But oh! for shame release mee. Were you but as sadd as I, And as full of mourning, Very griefe would make you die, Or at least cease scorning. UPON A GENTLEWOMAN'S ENTERTAINMENT OF HIMThe attribution of this poem is questionable. Whether, sweet Mistress, I should most Commend your music or your cost: Your well-spread table, or the choise Banquet of your hand and voyce, There's none will doubt: for can there be 'Twixt earth and heaven analogy? Or shall a trencher or dish stand In competition with your hand? Your hand that turns men all to ear, Your hand whose every joints a sphere: For certainly he that shall see The swiftnesse of your harmony, Will streightwayes in amazement prove The spheares to you but slowly move; And in that thought confess that thus The Heavens are come down to us, As he may well, when he shall hear Such airs as may be sung even there: Your sacred Anthems, strains that may Grace the eternal Quire to play: And certainly they were prepar'd By Angels only to be heard. Then happy I that was so blest To be yours and your music's guest, For which I'd change all other cheer, Thinking the best, though given, too dear. For yours are delicates that fill, And filling leave us empty still: Sweetmeats that surfeit to delight, Whose fullness is mere appetite. Then farewell all our heavenly fare, Those singing dainties of the air, For you to me do seem as good As all the consorts of the wood; And might I but enjoy by choice, My Quire should be your only voice. ON ALMA'S VOYCEThe attribution of this poem is questionable. What magick art Compells my soul to fly away, And leave desart My poor composed trunk of clay? Strange violence! thus pleasingly to teare The soul forth of the body by the eare. When Alma sings The pretty chanters of the skie Doe droop their wings As in disgrace they meant to die, Because their tunes which were before so rare Compar'd to hers doe but distract the air. Each sensitive In emulation proudly stands, Striving to thrive Under the bliss of her commands, Whose charming voyce doth bears &amp; tigers tame, And teach the sphears new melodies to frame. The Angells all (Astonisht at her heavenly air) Would sudden fall From cold amazement to dispaire, But that by nimble theft they all conspire To steal her hence for to enrich their quire. UPON A PICTUREThe attribution of this poem is questionable. Behold those faire eyes, in whose sight Sparkles a lustre no less bright Than that of rising Stars when they Would make the night outshine the day. To those pure lips the humming be May as to blooming Roses flee: The wanton wind about doth hurle, Courting in vain that lovely curle, And makes a murmur in despaire, To dally the unmooved haire. View but the cheeks where the red Rose And Lilly white a beauty grows, So orient as might adorne The flowing of the brightest morne. Sure 'tis no Picture, nere was made So much perfection in a shade: Her shape is soule enough to give A senseless Marble power to live. this an Idol be, no eye Can ever scape Idolatry. [DEATH-SONG]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Come, let us howle some heavy note, Some deadly dogged howl, Sounding as from the crying throate Of beasts or fatal fowle, As ravens, scrichowles, bulls, and bears, Wee'l bell and bawl our partes: Till irksome noise hath cloy'd our ears, And corrosived our hearts, And last when that our quire wants breth, Our bodies being blest, Wee'l sing like Swans to welcome death, And dye in peace and rest. TO HIS PAPERThe attribution of this poem is questionable. Flye nimble paper, light upon those hands Which have detained mee in perpetual bands: Go count those ivory palmes whose lilly hewe May represent thee to immortall view. Mount upp unto her eyes that there may shine Impressions of my love in every lyne; Expresse with silent eloquence the rare And true affection allwayes that I bare To thy sweete reader: lett her there behold The discontent and zealous payne enrolld Within a lover's breast. Tell her how I Am forc't to vent my sighes in poetry, And pine away with pastime of a verse, Making thee both my epicede and hearse. Present unto her an eternal mapp Of my disastrous fortune and mishapp: Delineate my passion and my payne Bredd with a deepe conceyt of her disdayne: Perhapps her flinty hart will then strike fire, And equall joyne her flames with my desire: Perhapps her cheerful brow and starlike eye Will lend a better aspect e'er I dye: But if shee frown and thou neglected lye, Thou know'st (deare paper) thy fowle destiny. TO THE SAMEThe attribution of this poem is questionable. Goe happie paper and for ever rest Within the Paradise of Parthenia's breast: Live there, O never lett thy lynes forsake her, Tenne thousand times more happie than the maker: Goe kisse her hands and in my name salute her, And tell her thus that silence is her suitor; Tell her that silence acts a sadder story, Than oathes or vowes or frantic oratory. The beggar that is dumbe an almes shall have Greater than hee that hath a tongue to crave: Be then the dailie object of her eye, Crowd and gett uppermost wherere thou lye: If high preferrment call thee as a guest To lodge in the faire chamber of her breast, Lye close and lett noe jealous eye behold thee, If any doe lett none but her unfold thee: And often as she reads thee smile upon her; Tell her her dearest friend is thinking on her: Tell her if you twoe chance to sleepe together— (Unfinished.)</field>
