      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. TO JOHN ALEXANDER BLENCOWE, My Oldest Friend. Friend, when at Harrow twenty years ago, Long ere my passion coveted the bays, We wandered o'er the green hill's winding ways, Our young hearts full of boyhood's eager glow, We knew not what should be, nor sought to know:â Now, somewhat of life's lengthening shadow strays Across our path, and in the summer days The perfume-laden winds more sadly blow. But still the world is fair, though Harrow days Are gone from us for ever; though no more Will Isis break to silver at our oar Or Cornish moorland purple meet our gaze. Friend, let me give thee these my latest lays, Full of old dreams of many a far-off shore. MISCELLANEOUS SONNETS. 1882. SONNET XIV. TO IRELAND. O Ireland, Ireland,âand we love thee well!â Lo! thy green meadows are made foul with red Blood-stains by thine own sons' mad folly shed; The land was heavenlike: thou hast made it hell. Thou hast set murder on the lonely fell, And filled the night with shadows of the dead, And made the moonlight shudder at the tread Of monstrous deeds too horrible to tell. And this is love of Ireland! Pause and think. Would not your love on nobler pinions soar If it were taught from cowardly crimes to shrink,â Murder to hate, injustice to abhor? Ye your own chains are forging link by link, And barring on yourselves your prison-door. SONNET XVII. THE GHOSTLY ARMIES. Over each city hangs a cloud of dead!â Far more in number than our living faces They fill with shadowy wings the crowded places, By their old leaders gathered still and led.â My eyes were opened. Lo! our parks were red With troops that Wellington at Waterloo Watched die before him:âNelson I saw too, And round him sailor-hosts in myriads sped. And round fair Paris a great army stands:â Paris is now besieged, and by an host Outnumbering all the armies of live lands; But every warrior is a bloodless ghost. They mount guard o'er the Seine, these warrior-bands, And dead Napoleon visits every post. SONNET XIX. AN EASTERN YEARNING. Oh, be thou just a rose! Why, thou canst kiss, And is not that enough? This weary âsoulâ That women cultivate, what heaven, what goal, Can it supply as sweet as passion's bliss! Half the delights of womanhood we miss Here in the West.âWoman and flowers are one. Instruct your flower:âflower-rapture all is done Straightway, and you forget what woman is. Oh, God deliver me from Western dreams Of culture! Give me just an Arab tent, And sweetly-moulded limbs within it pent, And sun and flowers, and stars, and pale moon-beams: This dark slave's shining bosom o'er me bent, In that she cannot spell, more shapely seems. SONNET XXI. GOD AND WOMAN. God made a woman,âand he stood aghast For very wonder. There she stood quite white,â Naked and perfect. God's eyes waxÃ¨d bright; Before him like a carven dream she passed. Her black hair on the heaven-breeze floated light; God watched her slowly vanish till at last The soft superb shape glimmered out of sight: Then on the trembling earth his tools he cast. âNow do I for the first time envy Manâ He said: âThe woman never will be mine; Those dark thick tresses darker than the pine And sweeter than the rose,âthat body wan And soft and scented like the dim woodbine,â I cannot own for ever:âbut he can.â SONNET XXII. GOD. Think you that God is moral? God is Loveâ But Love that transcends every mortal law:â The singer climbs with strange desire and awe These low green misty earthly hills above And sees the sun come nearer,âand he finds That God is not as man;âHe laughs to scorn The petty creeds of petty fancies born, And scatters all our goodness with his winds. Oh, God is not as man! Love in God's sight Is ever sweet, and passion ever pure: The God who made the wild hedge-rose so white Gave it besides the scent that doth allure; There is a holiness in all delight; The sweeter is the nobler law, be sure. SONNET XXIII. FORSAKEN. And shall thy sweetness wither, woman fair Set in the midst of lonely desert days? Dost thou lift up to heaven thy weary gaze And see nought round thee but the void blue air? Have no soft lips of lover kissed thine hair? Hath thine hand never toyed with myrtle sprays? Hast thou not wandered by the green-blue bays In summer, full of mystic dreams and rare? Oh, it were sin to leave thee blossoming soâ Alone, unplucked, unloved:âas great a sin As to pass by some lily set within A jungle,âwhere with heavy gait and slow The loveless monstrous beasts lurch to and fro, Piercing the rush-beds with their gaze unclean. SONNET XXVII. THE SONG-BRIDE. God hath his waters, and his winds and trees: Think you that in God's eyes one single rose Less beautiful and pure of petal blows Because no mortal the bright blossom sees? The haunt of every violet God's heart knows: And all the golden gorse upon the leas That loads with lavish scent the lingering breeze For God in its rich glory of colour glows. God hears all Nature singing unto him:â And so the poet inwardly is 'ware Of his own song's divine blue summer air, And, though the world of man should wax quite dim, Still would he stand triumphant,âfor his Bride Is his own song, for ever at his side. SONNET XXVIII. ALONE. Though England quite condemn me, yet am I Very content in lonely calm to stand Waiting,âmy ceaseless lyre within my hand And over me the uncondemning sky. O England, England, England,âif we try Our strange high visions unto thee to show, 'Tis ever the same answerâever âNoâ!â So one by one the baffled poets die. Yet hold I fast my vision. Though not one Were with me, I should hold it all the more.â The spirit of Beauty at the heart of things Is my one God, and till my life is done I'll follow her moonlit feet along the shore And mark the far faint glimmer of moonlit wings. SONNET XXIX. RELIGION AND ART. âReligion and Art are best kept apart, I think.ââ Ah!âJust so. Keep your God, and give me mine. Keep you your Sunday God, black-coated, grim,â Sever all Art and sweet delight from him,â Sip in his name your sacramental wine. My God is in these carven limbs that shine Upon the smooth blue sea's soft buoyant rim; My God is in these full rich lips that brim With kisses sweeter than rain-washed woodbine. Beauty is my God:âI am well content. All wonder of form ye see not; ye are blind. Pursue your road in peace,âye were not meant The tabernacle of my God to find. My God is hidden from all your evil eyes In dark-blue folds of thunder-guarded skies. SONNET XXX. IN ST. JAMES'S PARK. I watched the towers of Westminster shine grey Across the Park, beneath an April sun: The trees their first fresh verdure just had won: I thought of all those silent towers could say;â Of many a wild and blood-stained former day And grim deeds by the Thames' grey margin done; I called up English crowned heads one by one; I thought of Whitehall: and of Fotheringay. I mused:âThen lifted up my head and lo! A girl was passing by, in jacket brown Of soft stamped velvet,âshe passed, looking down, And towards historic Westminster did go: After awhile I rose, and followed slow: What drew me?âWestminster, or fluttering gown? SONNETS XLIV., XLV., XLVI. A MORAL VICTORY: AND ITS RESULT. I. A lover conquered passion,âand he let The great sweet chance slip through his fingers quite: But was he closer unto God that night, Knowing that passion's golden sun had set? Did no wild storms of anguish and regret Sweep o'er his lonely couch,âwhereon a white Soft figure should have lain?âthe battle of right Had been fought outâthe victory won,âand yet.... All through that night he tossed about,âin dreams Seeing a rose ungathered beckoning him: Seeing the sudden flash of white that gleams Above the bodice-lacework's loosened rim: Waking and graspingâjust the cold moonbeams! Till morning broke,ârainy and weird and dim. II. Then forth he went and wandered by the sea: The horizon cleared and the fair golden sun Flashed on the waves that answered one by one, And,âturning inland,âmany a wet rose-tree Flung rainbow dew-drops at him merrily. The battle he the previous night had won Seemed like a fierce defeat,âa hot race run For worse than nothing: such strange beings are we! âAnd sheââhe thoughtââmy rose-bush all this night Of perfect passionate summer left alone: With never a kiss imprinted on the white Rose-breast that might have been my own . . . my own . . . To-night is left us still: the ways untrod Shall ring to-night to passion's steeds,âby God!â III. And that night,âhaving sent a letter first,â He waited her beside the blue still sea. The ripples at his feet plashed tenderly,â Now he was ready,âlet Fate do its worst, No night than last night could be more accursed! Now he felt oneness with the rich rose-tree, And watched the sunset,âand it did not flee, Then passion grasped his throat with giant thirst. He turned to meet her,âfor the hour had come. Then lo! a carriage by the sea-side wall, And into his a woman's eyes once flashed; Then on towards Venice the grey horses dashed. He saw it now,âLast night or never at all:â Ayeânever, never, never!âtill the tomb. SONNET XLVII. ALL OVER AGAIN. A poet thought:ââAh! to start quite afresh! To die to the old passions and begin In some new city a new life to win! To break from every old entangling mesh! No more 'mid London's rough discordant din To love,âbut in white Paris or in Rome Or Veniceâanywhere far off from homeâ To gather a golden new love-harvest in! âOh, I could loveââhe thoughtââas though I ne'er Had loved before,âwithin me doth remain Limitless youth: I could meet woman's eyes As a glad boy of fourteen meets June skies Upon a holiday morning:âin the air Of Italy I could love all over again!â SONNET LI. FORGOTTEN JESUS. I stood beside the Galilean Lake And what was left of Jesus?âBright and blue Just as in the old days they used to do The ripples laughed, and soft mist flake on flake Brooded above the rushes in the brake,â Yet every human face I met was new:â Ah me! The world has never yet been true For any woman's love or hero's sake! Christ was forgotten of the hills and skies!â New fishermen their brown nets dragged and flung Within the waters,âand their chants they sung Towards other dark-skinned maidens' answering eyes Than those who in the far-off summers hung On Jesus' lips, and harkened to his sighs. SONNET LIV. THE COQUETTE-WORLD. The world is a coquette. She kissed, and clung Round Jesus as an actress clings around Her long-lost lover on a sudden found,â And over him her tearful hands she wrung. For nineteen centuries round his tomb she sung And her strong passion seemed to know no bound:â White craving supple lithesome arms she wound About the throat that on the black cross hung. What was it worth?âShe hath a new love now, A young love,âand she marks within his eyes The far-off light of summers of new skies, And flowers unfaded ring his lineless brow:â Christ and his centuries pass,âand, laughing, she Flings white arms round the Twentieth Century. SONNET LVII. HEAVEN AND WOMAN. And what are twenty centuries unto God! Just one swift starry night, and nothing more; Just one light speedy footfall on the floor Of time: one summer blossoming the sod. So mused I in Bond Street: and the ceaseless roar Of carriages seemed like the centuries wheeling Red ranks round God's throne, with wet eyes appealing For pity,âcrime on crime and war on war. Through the blue sky I gazed as in a dream:â Then my eyes fell, and in a carriage lo! An olive-skinned clear face and lips that glow With loveliest power of passion, and a gleam Of Italy in the eyes, and forehead low And shapely.âHow far-off those star-thoughts seem! SONNET LIX. LOST RICHES. O riches of all the ages we have missed!â Dark eyes, dark tresses, in old Eastern lands,â Wonderful thrilling of electric hands,â Lips fairer than all flowers, alas! unkissed. Blue tender veins on Cleopatra's wrist,â Eyes gazing over red burnt Indian sands,â Eyes sweeter than the blue sea that expands Round Venice;âoh, the long heart-piercing list!â And whom of all that long list have we seen? Poets, who have the eternal heart of Time Mixed with your own in magnitude sublime, Ye have kissed the lips it may be of one queen Of love and song, and crowned her in your rhyme,â One!âyet red lips are numberless, I ween! SONNET. IN BOHEMIA: A CONTRAST. A scanty room:âpoor furniture indeed: Just one thin-blanketed small tressel-bed, And over it a washed-out grey shawl spread; Wall-paper showing some green wide-branched weed. Cracked low discoloured ceiling overhead And on the floor a rug,âno carpet there; A picture opposite that seemed to stare, Full of great colour-blots of blue and red. Such was the bower of love:âand on the bed A woman, beautiful as early morn. Soft cool lips, full of love, or full of scorn, And breast whose sweet touch might awake the dead. No golden palace,âyet within this place More than a Cleopatra's eyes and face. May, 1882. SONNETS. 1876, 1877. IV. THE ONE STAR. There are sad places where no star-beam shines, Waste desolate abysses of the dark, Where no glad light the wandering soul may mark,â Whereover the black waves in stormy lines Pour ceaselessly:âspots where no angel's foot Has trodden; lurid as deep deadly mines: Hell-pits wherein the lingering captive pines; Devoid of buds and flowers and gracious fruit. What star can light them, or what step traverse These regions branded with a mystic curse? What help can reach the prisoners therein bound,â Cold pulses there shall throb at what glad sound? What flame, what fire, can comfort there impart? Only the sweet fire of a woman's heart. THY SPANISH LOVES. (To Alfred de Musset.) Ah yes! thy Spanish loves, O sweet-lipped brother poetâ I know their glory well. What poet ever loved dark eyes, and does not know it,â And knowing it, now knows not heaven, and hell? First heaven, then hell,âand heaven and hell again and so on. When dark eyes are in vogue Satan wakes up and calls his carriage. What will go on He knows full well,âthe rogue! Dark eyes and coal-black hair,âand murder and adultery And other suchlike things. Love stops at nothing in Spain. The Spanish skies are sultry And,âGod! how sweetly a Spanish soft laugh rings! Blue eyes mean nothing much; but dark eyes mean the devil,â The devil and all his train. They mean long nights when wild loosehaired mad sweet dreams revel Till morning blushes at the pane! And when the Spanish eyes and Spanish locks in London Gleam tenderly, good Lord! All sober vows and strict resolves are straightway undone. Does conscience speak? You pink him with your sword! If Spanish eyes and hair could madden a French poet In France or sunny Spain They madden thrice as much in this pale land,âI know it, And give us thrice the pleasure, and thrice the pain. Dec., 1882. SEVEN SONNETS. (These Sonnets were first published in the âEchoâ.) II. CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. âVengeance is mine.â So saith the mighty Lord. âVengeance is mine; deliver unto me The manâI claim him. He is not for thee, Thou land of his, to slay. Mine is the sword Of vengeance. Put by that accursed cord, And hack to pieces that black gallows-tree;â Murder no murderer; let the creature be; Mine are the gates of death,ââso saith the Lord. âThe spirit he hath slain is in my hand; I will judge justly, punish and requite; But purge this stain of blood from out the land. The dawn is waiting, but its golden light Trembles, for in its path your gibbets stand, Still clothed about with horrors of the night.â April 18, 1882. IV. THE DAY OF THANKSGIVING: AFTER THE EGYPTIAN WAR OF 1882. Thank God for what, ye clerical conclave? For corpses piled beneath the Eastern sky, And wounded men whose one prayer is to die? For blood and wrath and battle and the grave? Now from church aisle and arched cathedral nave Must sound of triumph-hymning float on high? Nay, rather close the red book with a sigh, And seek in sober calm the land to save. Ye priests, who now would make God such as ye, Refrain,âand let the pale dead sleep in peace. Let the white Eastern moon soar silently Over the bloodied plains; let shouting cease. Think you the hearts of watching angels glowed When through dark ranks wet bayonets rent their road? Sept. 23, 1882. VI. FOR VICTOR HUGO'S EIGHTY-FIRST BIRTHDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1883. The skies have had their poets, and the flowers Have had their poets, and the sea has heard Passionate singing louder than of bird Who chants amid the night's dim throbbing bowers. Poets have sung of love's absorbing hours, And battle has put in its fiery word, And sorrow itself to sweetest song has spurred;â The storms have had their singers, and the showers. But only one great soul has sung the whole Of Nature and of Man, commensurate With both of these, and touched song's loftiest goal; One man has challenged Time and conquered Fate: Hugoâwho saw the century's sunrise glow, Eighty and one majestic years ago. VII. WILLIAM GOULDSTONE. This unfortunate man, in a fit of homicidal frenzy, killed three of his children, and violently attacked and injured the remaining two. His life was subsequently spared on the ground of insanity. The man âsees redâ. A man who slays wholesaleâ Makes his own hearthstone run with dripping gore, And, having killed three children, seeks for more To slaughter, doing a deed which turneth pale E'en Love and Mercy 'neath the eternal veil Of cloud whence white-winged pity and healing soar; A man who brings the ravage of red war Into his peaceful home, and then can hail His own fierce-eyed intolerable deed As a deliverance from his pressing woe; The man who, when his own five children bleed Before him, thinks that he has holpen so Their mother:âif thou hang âtill he be deadâ This madman, Englandâthen thine eyes âsee red!â Sept. 20, 1883. A WINTER VISION. I When Winter round us throws His mantle of white snows And dimmer The fog-bound daylight grows Nor glimmer Is with us of red rose Nor swimmer Through the blue water goes,â II Where are we then to find Rest for the weary mind?â No splendour Of green hills where the wind Wails tender Through avenues black-pined Can render Our worn-out hearts resigned! III Where the grand sunsets red Above the lake were shed Till rushes Amid the water bled And bushes Waved many a golden head, Now blushes No sky-cheek: all is dead. IV Where the white lilies grew And harebells, dainty-blue, And flowers Diverse in scent and hue, And bowers The August sun flamed through, And towers Of greenery draped in dew, V The weary white wet snow Before the wind doth blow And eddy: Homeward we have to go, And ready We find our books a-row; With steady Gaze we glance to and fro;â VI And in a moment we Forget the snow-clad lea: The glory Of Guinevere we see, And hoary Breakers that burst and flee, And gory Knights battling knee to knee. VII Or else in Fairyland With Spenser's self we stand, Or follow The pious Latian band O'er hollow Sea-gulfs from strand to strand:â Apollo Next takes us by the hand. VIII Through Italy we go With hearts and souls a-glow,â The thunder Of Dante's rhythmic flow Doth sunder The heavens with throb and throe, And wonder On wonder doth forthshow. IX With Hugo next we tread Through streets and alleys red,â Are taken To haunts of the great dead; Heart-shaken We bow before his head Forsaken Full oft of those it led. X With Keats we thread the deep Dream-land of love and sleep, And fancies Bright-winged around us leap With glances That make the spirit weep And lances That the old-world forests sweep. XI And Wordsworth makes the air With mountain-sweetness fair, And gracious With song of rivers rare, And spacious,â The mountain-valleys bear Capacious Woods nestling everywhere. XII And Shakespeare with the eyes That saw all storms and skies And lifted Man heavenward in strange wise, God-gifted Now doth before us rise:â Time's shifted,â Behold, dull Winter flies! Dec., 1881. A WINTER SONG. I Lo! the snow On the roofs rests, dreary white: Was the glow Of Love's beauty ever bright? II Green, serene, Were sweet gardens ever fair? Did love lean Downward through the enchanted air? III Soft and oft Did the touch of Venus come? Now aloft Hangs alone the snow's cold bloom! IV Rose, where glows All thy June-glad beauty now? Hoar-frost throws Its wild web o'er every bough! V Death, whose breath Through the green glad year delayed, Twines his wreath Now within the hawthorn shade. VI Bowers and flowers All have vanished, all are gone: Dreary hours Crown us with their chaplets wan. VII Cold doth hold Hand and heart and harp and lyre: Young and old Huddle round the heaped-up fire. VIII Art hath part Never with the dreary cold: All his heart Yearns towards Summer's hair of gold! IX Eyes like skies Hath he,âlarge and deepest blue: Now he flies With drooped wings the raw air through! X Now his brow Lowereth,âand his eyes are dull, Wondering how Grass can edge the frozen pool! XI Night is bright Only in the theatre: There we might Find Art's Bride, and gaze at her! XII Gain the Fane Of life's wintry Art, and there, Loud, amain, Music thrills the lighted air! XIII Clear and dear, Soft Ophelia's voice is heard, Hovering near, Lute-sweet as a summer bird! XIV Death Macbeth Plans for king and guest and friend: Hamlet saith Words that haunt us to the end. XV Blind we find Aged Lear,âwe watch and weep As the wind Roars round many a castled steep. XVI Fair the hair Of pale Desdemona gleams: Through the air Of still night we watch her dreams. XVII Gaunt the vaunt Of Othello breaks the hush. Fairies haunt Brake and mere and blossomed bush: XVIII Oberon's robe Glitters in the leafy glen; Many a globe Of white dew-drops sparkles then! XIX Here the clear Voice of Art in winter sounds, Far and near Thrilling all the forest-bounds! XX Winter thin, Peaked of face and sharp of hand, Treads not in That enchanted viewless land. XXI There the air Ever full of high romance Shines June-fair,â And blue streams for ever dance XXII 'Tween the green Sweet unfrozen mellow fields, And gold sheen Strikes on strong knights' sunlit shields. Dec., 1881. AND YET. All seemed forlorn: bright hope had died away,â The waves were grey, And sullen waters on the shore-banks beat; The heaven I once desired had vanished quite And all its lightâ And yet the world was sweet! Death and the end of all things hasteneth on,â Soon are we gone,â The gaudy-winged reproachful years are fleet; A flower no sooner bloometh soft and fair Than comes despairâ And yet earth's skies are sweet! The old hope has fled with swift resounding wings; No glad voice sings; Dreams silver-plumed and tender-lipped retreat; To-day we live,âto-morrow our spent breath Is still in deathâ And yet the streams sound sweet! The summer mocks us with its wealth of blue And wondrous hue And fervent fierce unsympathetic heat; The blossoms mock us with their wealth of sheen, Gay midst the greenâ Yet starlit nights are sweet! Places where love in old bright days was fair And joys that were The one same swift despairing chant repeat; The grass will shortly wave above our tomb With green wild bloomâ And yet the grass is sweet! Women are frail, and not so true as fair; Their gold bright hair Withers, as withers the rich auburn wheat; They pass,âyea, all things pass; the loveliest things Have readiest wingsâ Yet lovely things are sweet! Love and all tender joys will soon be o'er And we no more Shall thrill at the approach of woman's feet; Quiet we soon in the chill earth shall lie, My love and Iâ And yet my love is sweet! June, 1881. MIRROR AND ROSE. âWhen visiting the sea, he takes his microscope, And all his passion of soul is centred in the hope That he may find a prize Amid the pallid weeds and slimy shelly things: In butterflies he loves the scales upon their wings,â He never sees the skies. âHe never sees the waves whose shining squadrons break On moonlit shining shores; blue ripples of the lake Are nothing unto him: Here am I, woman-ripe and splendid (am I fair? Oh answer me, soft eyes of mirror over there?)â But still his eyes are dim! âNot all men's eyes are dim! Not every man is blind: Am I (I wonder much?) a sinner if I find Man's gracious homage sweet? Am I (I question much?) a sinner if I pour What he will never seek some other soul before,â Yea, at another's feet? âThrough all these weary years my soul hath lived alone: Sometimes it hath endured,âand sometimes made its moan To stars and midnight breeze:â He never thinks me fair,âhe never thinks me sweet,â (Slide off, thou foolish gownâsoârustle to my feet! What is't the mirror sees? âAh! . . . Lo! before the glass unclothed, a woman white, I stand: ah, now I know:âbut never till this night Deemed I that I was fair. How the strange scent from that just-gathered dewy rose Like fragrance in a dream all round about me goes,â Like love's own fatal air! âAh! some one said to-night . . . what was it? . . . that my hair Was beautiful: rush round my shining shoulder bare,â Twine serpent-likeâah! so: And if my lover's face shone fair within the glass, Red lips you'd forward lean? Or would you let it pass?â Tongue,âwould you whisper, âNo!â) âHark! on the stairs a stepâGown, hasten on again; If he should find you thus, how he would stare amain This white soft shape to see. To him it would mean lessâa whole world less indeedâ Than snowy plume of some tide-tangled gummy weed Or sea-anemone! âHe'd think I was bewitched: I've half a mindâbut no! Only the eyes that love must ever see me so; Only those eyes of grey! And the dear mirror's eyes,ânow, mirror, be discreet! Remember that you saw just nothing but my feet! Rose, thou wilt not betray? âHis feet upon the stairs,âhis hand upon the door; This brooch,âand all is then just as it was before: Remember, mirror and rose!ââ âQuick, Maggie! run and fetch the table and the lamp; This seaweed must be searched while still the fronds are damp;â How bright that pier-glass glows!â March, 1882. THE KING. The king had but to stretch his hand forth and they brought him Fair women. All the queens of all the far lands sought him. He sent through land and sea For dark-eyed dark-haired brides to add to his harem's treasures: Just as he sank on cushions, sank he amid pleasures: Life seemed for him just one long blossoming tree. Loves came from North and South; from Eastern and Western cities: At night the feast was spread, and amorous hymns and ditties Rose up to the moonlit air. Then the still dark was lit by white arms and embraces, And the rich blossoms' scent crept round about close faces,â And each night some unkissed new mouth was there. If in the streets he saw some maiden or some married Dark eyes desirable, his strong men straightway carried The woman to the high White palace-walls: and there on silken cushions seated, Soft curtains hanging around, blue, gold, and crimson-pleated, She waited, the king's august couch anigh. But one day, found in some far-off dim wind-swept island Where the wan mist-wreaths dwell and crown each granite highland, A grey-eyed maid was brought Captive to the great king; and she the night he sought her By her own dagger fled, the intrepid Northland's daughter, And passed beyond the reach of hand or thought. And ever till he died the great king pined and maddened, And 'mid the cushions bright his tarnished sick soul saddened: For, though he had all things And all the women of all the land at his disposal, Yet just the one he sought had shirked her royal espousal And in the desert spread a sea-bird's wings. This glimpse was all he had of woman's soul. Thereafter Through every embrace he heard the Western girl's clear laughter As out the dagger flew:â And when the lips of slaves upon his lips were lavish He longed for that one mouth no king or God could ravish And yearned for those unconquered eyes grey-blue. Sept., 1882. TWO SONNETS. I. TO-NIGHT. To-night I claim thee, ladyâclaim thy soul. Give all thou canst with lavish hands away, All that I covet, suffer for, will stayâ Far, far it is even out of thy control. Now on the closing of thy marriage-day As it were, I come to thee, and would unveil With tender solemn speed thy beauty pale, And gaze deep in thine eyes of marvellous grey. Deep, deep, and ever deeper I would gaze, Till on this evening of thy day of days I draw thee forth, as from his very embrace: Yea, strenuous arms of his shall tremble, and part, Till, heeding not the prison where thou art, I weeping, kiss thee on the weeping face. April 27, 1876. II. ALONE. Yea, next, my love shall come to me alone, Dividing herself from all friends and kin: So passion's supreme pleasure we shall win, And watch God, without trembling, on his throne. Then shalt thou be, my lady sweet, mine own;â Then all the fierce sad seasons that have been, Heavy with sorrow, dark or red with sin, Shall vanish, like pale mists to nightward blown. All these, thy friends of youth, thou shalt forsake,â Husband and home, and mother,âand shalt take Thine own sweet soul, that only, in thine hand:â This shalt thou in the far sure future do; Ages may pass-yet God's word shall come true; One day thou shalt arise at Love's command. April 27, 1876. A RUSSIAN WOMAN TO A RUSSIAN NIHILIST. I love thy red right hand. I love thy reckless daring: Thine eyes with half the fire of some fierce tiger's glaring. I love thy strength and zeal. If thou wert quite alone, and all the world united Against thee, thou wouldst be (I know!) the more delighted: With lonely rapture brain and heart would reel. Yes, thou art wicked, love. Thou art a malefactor. Thine own hands do dark deeds: thou art no sluggish actor In all this century's strife. The hand that I have kissed upon the dagger closes With deadly iron grip. I gather harmless roses: But thou dost gather with red pruning-knife. Thou hast no mercy of heart nor pity of soul within thee: Only a vast wild flame, consuming, wrathful, in thee; Canst thou love, sweetheart, me? Nay, I am but a river; my banks are full of flowers: My hair is full of scent of honey-suckle bowers: Thou art the tidal cruel desperate sea. Thou art the seaâbut red: not blue or sweet or quiet. I know thee. Through thy brain wild deeds in maddest riot Roar on their lonely way. Thou art the sea. I am the gentle-souled calm river Along whose banks the reeds in their green squadrons quiver. I meet thee,âthen am tinged with blood-shot spray. I meet thee. Then with joy of every pulse that tingles My calm white river-soul with thy red spirit mingles And with thy fury of heart. I cast for wreaths and crowns my river-flowers upon thee And cast my whole rapt soul in love and worship on thee; Then watch thee for some fiery deed depart. Thy vast tides crimson-stained flow half way up the river, O sea-love, making all my bank-side poplars shiver With awe at the strange red:â And I,âI bring thee down a flower or two with laughter From far-off inland meads which thou shalt wear hereafter, Lover, when I am lost in thee and dead. Thou hast made women weep. I love thee better for it. Their lovers hast thou slain? I care not for their florid Display of tears and woe. Orâif their woe be realâis not my joy still plainer That follows on their grief as watchful-eyed retainer And dogs them with its steady footstep slow? Thou: thou wouldst battle, strong and iron-armed and fearless, Against great hosts of stars,âand I could watch thee, tearless, Yea revelling, O my lord, In thy stern wrath as through the golden serried legions Summoned by bugle of God from far blue pathless regions Flickered the quick sheen of thy dripping sword. Thou hast no pity of heart. I know and I have said it. Thy pitiless strong soulâI know nor do I dread it Though it should cast off me! What is a soft stream worth whose ripples dance and revel Compared to the great force that fears not God or devil,â The sea-like monstrous furious force of thee? I am thy river-bride. But thou art oceanic And limitless and fierce, steel-sinewed and Titanic,â A very god to me. Full of the singing strength of all the white-waved water: I am the golden sunlight's flower-engendering daughter; Thou art the offspring of the flowerless sea. Thou fearest hardly God. If God were king and tyrant Thine would be the first sword, swift, eager, and aspirant That tyrant-God to slay. Thou hast the strength of will of God himself within thee, And that is why my soul so longs, O love, to win thee, And why my fingers in thy black locks play. If God were tyrant here, thou wouldst be calmâno bragger. But out would leap thy keen bright-polished trusty dagger And straight to the very heart God thou wouldst stab.âAnd lo! his blood would flow around thee And it would be as if a red sunset had crowned thee Painted in heaven by thy swift splashing dart. How I would love thee then!âFrom river-side and hollow I'd bring thee violets then, and thy strong footstep follow O lover, O my sea, Soft, flower-sweet, flower-divine,âthy soft companion truly; The one soul in the world who understands thee duly And worships the enormous force in thee. I pray for thee. (So strange is woman's complex passion!) I pray for thee in true deep-yearning woman's fashion: Yet thou art God and lord To me,âand I would kiss in holy sacramental Calm tearless fearless wise, with loving lips and gentle, The blade, yet reeking, of thy yet warm sword. What is a woman's love but love for strength and power? Just the strange love of some poor simple stream-side flower For the vast power and might That fills the sea with strength, and fills the heavens with burning Vast quenchless ever-new, at each new dawn returning, Unfathomable wonderful sunlight. Thou art the sea and sun. I lose in thee my being, Some far-off high divine fair consummation seeing When thou and I made one Shall pass along the ranks of fiery-winged immortals And through eternal life's irrevocable portals, For thou art God: God is the sea and sun. April, 1883. POETRY AND SCIENCE. Not all the songs of stars and starry wild embraces Are worth the very least and worst of human faces: Not all the suns can shine Like one true human heart that glows with loving-kindness: Gaze through your telescopes till ye be stricken with blindness; Not all your lore is worth one golden line! What is it unto man to know the leagues that sever Our patient green-grassed earth for ever and for ever From Sirius or from Mars? What is it unto us to know that three-ringed Saturn Is uncompleted yet, a laggard and a slattern, For all his moons, amid the elder stars! What is it unto us to gaze till brain grows dizzy At the wild golden ants who make the heaven so busy As over it they creep? If unto us the heaven were opened, and we knew them, Gold star by star, and could, long rank by rank, review them, Would it be worth one gift of white-armed sleep? Would it be worth the sleep that Love pours o'er the pillow When the soft rest succeeds to passion's wild fierce billow? Would all the starry lore Be worth two star-like eyes, and mouth so sweet and tender Its warm close touch outweighs the cold sidereal splendour? Love gives us all things. Can the stars do more? What is it worth to man to thread the chill star-spaces? Oh here on earth are warm white passionate embraces! Thou needst not seek the sky! Lo! very near and sweet the flowers of earth surround thee. If woman's lips have touched and woman's love hath crowned thee Thou hast thine heaven of suns and stars,âclose by. In traversing the air one grows quite cold and chilly! Far, far, beyond all rocks and cliffs and uplands hilly The eyes of Science seek. Then back to earth they turn; and yet the glow within them Is not what we should see (and see with gladness) in them Had Love once touched cold Science' frigid cheek! The old warm myths of Greece had far more life and glory Than Science e'er will have, though she wax old and hoary And wise beyond her dream. The moon and sun were gods. We could not do without them. Our misery is now we know too much about them. We analyse Apollo's golden beam. We analyse all things, and push too far inquiry.â The rainbow is mere light. The sun is but a fiery Vast glowing blazing orb. Oh, better far than this through the green woods to wander And meet a white-robed sweet great-eyed grand goddess yonder And let her beauty all your soul absorb! It was far betterâyes!âto meet a woodland fairy Than to sail forth throughout the blue void regions airy With Tyndall by your side! I'd chooseâyes, I would choose!âhad I the choice, to follow Along the gold-flowered mead the footsteps of Apollo Rather than Proctor's,âthough his path be wide! Give me the days of faith, and not the days of Science, Where fancy is concerned. Each new exact appliance Leaves still less room to dream. The fairies, like the wolves that haunted forest-marches, Are disappearing fast. No white robe thrills the larches: Titania travels not the moony gleam! Knowledge hath little worth, if all the dreams are going. God! let me wander forth beside blue waters flowing And find sweet Venus there. Let me within the grove find some gay frolic fairy And clasp her round the waist, and kiss the red lips chary! Let me watch in the stream the Naiad's hair! To know is great and well: but not to know is better. To add new facts to facts adds fetter unto fetter For all the human race. To number all the stars outweighs not what we are losing In knowing that no more among the reed-beds musing Shall we see Pan's half-human wrinkled face. March, 1883. SOPHIA PEROVSKAIA. âShe was beautiful. It was not the beauty which dazzles at first sight, but that which fascinates the more, the more it is regarded. âA blonde, with a pair of blue eyes, serious, and penetrating, under a broad and spacious forehead. A delicate little nose, a charming mouth, which showed, when she smiled, two rows of very fine white teeth. âIt was, however, her countenance as a whole which was the attraction. There was something brisk, vivacious, and at the same time, ingenuous in her rounded face. She was girlhood personified. Notwithstanding her twenty-six years, she seemed scarcely eighteen. A small, slender, and very graceful figure, and a voice as charming, silvery, and sympathetic as could be, heightened this illusion. It became almost a certainty, when she began to laugh, which very often happened. She had the ready laugh of a girl, and laughed with so much heartiness, and so unaffectedly, that she really seemed a young lass of sixteen. âShe gave little thought to her appearance. She dressed in the most modest manner, and perhaps did not even know what dress or ornament was becoming or unbecoming. But she had a passion for neatness, and in this was as punctilious as a Swiss girl. The fact that, when in prison under sentence of death, Sophia Perovskaia wrote to her mother asking that some clean collars and cuffs might be sent to her, is a touching comment upon this statement. âShe was very fond of children, and was an excellent school-mistress. There was, however, another office that she filled even better; that of nurse. When any of her friends fell ill, Sophia was the first to offer herself for this difficult duty, and she performed that duty with such gentleness, cheerfulness, and patience, that she won the hearts of her patients, for all time. âYet this woman, with such an innocent appearance, and with such a sweet and affectionate disposition, was one of the most dreaded members of the Terrorist party. âIt was she who had the direction of the attempt of March 13; it was she who, with a pencil, drew out upon an old envelope the plan of the locality, who assigned to the conspirators their respective posts, and who, upon the fatal morning, remained upon the field of battle, receiving from her sentinels news of the Emperor's movements, and informing the conspirators, by means of a handkerchief, where they were to proceed. âWhat Titanic force was concealed under this serene appearance? What qualities did this extraordinary woman possess? âShe united in herself the three forces which of themselves constitute power of the highest order: a profound and vast capacity, an enthusiastic and ardent disposition, and, above all, an iron will.â âSophia Perovskaia belonged, like Krapotkine, to the highest aristocracy of Russia. The Perovski are the younger branch of the family of the famous Rasumovsky, the morganatic husband of the Empress Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the Great, who occupied the throne of Russia in the middle of the last century (1741â1762). Her grandfather was Minister of Public Instruction; her father was Governor-General of St. Petersburg; her paternal uncle, the celebrated Count Perovsky, conquered for the Emperor Nicholas a considerable part of Central Asia. âSuch was the family to which this woman belonged who gave such a tremendous blow to Czarism. âSophia was born in the year 1854. Her youth was sorrowful. She had a despotic father, and an adored mother, always outraged and humiliated. It was in her home that the germs were developed in her, of that hatred of oppression, and that generous love of the weak and oppressed, which she preserved throughout her whole life.ââ âUnderground Russia: Revolutionary Profiles and Sketches from Life.â By Stepniak. Translated from the Italian. London: 1883. Pp. 126, 127, 128. I Blue-eyed, fair-haired, and young,âa girl in outward seeming,â Yet when thy foot did pass amid the meadows dreaming Of gold-haired spring, What dreams were thine, O strange heroic woman-spirit? Dreams of the Freedom which thy land shall yet inherit? Dreams of vast tyrannies upon the wing?â II When other maidens dream of love and tender flowers And lovers' voices sweet within the may-white bowers, Thou,âthou alone,â Wast dreaming of the deed that set the world a-wonder And hurled amid one burst of Revolution's thunder That world's most mighty monarch from his throne. III No blossoms white were thine, but blossoms weird and gory. Thou, thou alone, didst stand before an Empire's glory And saidst that it should fall. High-born and noble, thou didst leave the lordly places And thou didst wander forth, a light for poor men's faces: Love, wealth, repose;âthou didst surrender all. IV And has not yet a song from our free isle resounded, For thee, for thee,âwho, when the tyrant's deeds abounded, Didst say that these should cease? Are all our transports saved for old historic cities? Have we no hearts, no souls, no fiery loveful ditties, For Russia? Are we chained to Rome and Greece? V When thou didst slay and die, were all our singers staggered At thy vast size of soul and might of hand red-daggered? That none could say: âThe Empire faced one girl. Yet when the battle ended, That Empire's cruel life with blood and fire was blended;â A Czar before a girl's stroke passed away. VI âPassed like a dream.â O thou who didst the deed tremendous Design and plot and plan,âwhose white hand did defend us From blood-red hands,â A bitter sin it was that never a poet hearkened When o'er thine head the storm of black revenge down-darkened: That not one song was launched from freer lands! VII A bitter sin it was that only English waters Free-souled thrilled at thy deed; not England's white-souled daughters, Nor strong-souled English men. A grievous thing it was that only our sea-waves knew thee And saw the noble pulse of English blood beat through thee, Thee,âfree-souled still within thy prison-den. VIII And I,âI would not die without one strong word spoken Whereby the English chill grim silence may be broken: I would send unto thee The greeting of our waves, the love-song of the billows, And greeting of green leaves of England's oaks and willows, And our sun's song wherewith he loves our sea. IX With more than English force thou didst withstand the tyrant; And round thee Russia's sons ranged, flame-souled and aspirant, Thee following hard. An army thou hast had around thee and behind thee; Yet couldst thou never indeed for all thy greatness find thee One true-souled singer, one impassioned bard? X The stars and seas and winds and flowers and leaves, these know thee. Then why should human song o'erlook thee and forego thee, O thou most great, Who when thy land was dead and never foot came forward Didst watch the tyrant-wave with deadly crest roll shoreward, Yet wast content its thundering blow to wait. XI An Empire and a world against thee.âThou a river, Soft, silver-tongued and sweet,âwhereo'er love's branches quiver And beckon with their bloom. Love and delights behind, and all the flowers of pleasure; A life that might yield joy in unknown sumptuous measure;â Behind thee, rainbow-hopes. In front the tomb. XII Yet thou didst choose the tomb, and thou didst, river-tender, Against the foaming tides and cruel soulless splendour Of sea-wide tyranny Hurl thy blue rippling waves; and thou didst for a season Make all that tidal waste of oceanic treason A conquered tideless helpless prostrate sea. XIII One river against the sea! Soon its waves fell upon thee, And hurled their gathered might of tidal waters on thee As tigers leap. Yet thou hadst stemmed the sea! With thy clear river-current Hadst barred the cruel white waves' multitudinous torrent And driven them backward on the shuddering deep. XIV A girl of twenty-six! A mere blue-eyed soft flower! Yet through thee spake the Soul's immeasurable power That sun nor star Nor moon can e'er withstand, nor tidal waves oppressive, Nor crowns that rest on crime, nor rulers retrogressive, Nor the omnipotent (worm-eaten) Czar. XV Through thee the heart of Greece and England's spirit chainless And souls of all brave men and women's spirits stainless Spake. Through thy maiden hand The might of Russia struck. Thou didst not perish truly; For every day thy deed and fearless death speak newly To thine, and unto many another land. XVI This is thy crown of glory and title of remembrance: That when the Empire's might and its black-eagle-semblance And all its chains and bars On one side were arrayed, and on the lonely other Thou,âthou didst win:âalong with Liberty thy brother, And all thy clear-eyed sister-hosts the stars. April, 1883. GELIABOFF. Geliaboff, who was loved by Sophia Perovskaia, had, as it happened, taken no direct part in the murder of the Czar on March 13, 1882. But he was arrested, and he and Sophia Perovskaia were executed on the same day. I Here is a bridal bower! Here is a marriage-chamber! Hung not with tinted silk, or bright pure cloth of amber: The deadly black Scaffold is all that these will know of bower of roses; Now for the man and maid their earthly journey closes, And lo! what blood-hounds bay around their track. II Only the red strange flowers of Revolution's garden For these, who having sinned beyond all mortal pardon And slain the Czar Must pass, not uncontent, into the viewless region Where every light goes out, save only perhaps the legion Of God's lamps,âmoon on moon and star on star. III O strange embrace for these and enigmatic bridal! Never to meet in love, save only when the tidal Great streams of human gore From governmental swords and their own knives were running And Revolution's waves all human ears were stunning With their dull deadly desperate ravening roar. IV Never to meet in love in joyous green-leafed places! Never to hope for love and common sweet embraces That all souls hope to win! To have vowed their lives to crime as to a sacramental Great task,âthe lover strong, and she the Russian gentle And high-born woman, red to the eyes with sin! V Stained with all deadliest sinâif this be sin, the plotting How, when a native land lies helpless, bound, and rotting In slavery grim, And when a despot holds the keys of every prison, To bring to prisoned eyes fair Freedom's sunny vision Even, if it need be, through the death of him. VI If this be sin,âto hold that one man's life is little, A thread most thin indeed, and frail of make, and brittle, Though he be the Czar, Compared with ceaseless lives that wear away in bondage, Lives multitudinous as the blood-red autumn frondage, Who surge in pain and beckon from afar. VII If this be sin,âto meet the Terror White with savage Response o'the Terror Red; the swords that slay and ravage With keener swords that slay;â To oppose to headstrong brain of one besotted Ruler Brains forceful as his own,âas resolute but cooler; To meet white foam-tides with red tidal spray. VIII If this be sin,âto cast one's life and all one's being On one side in the scale, and then with deep sigh seeing That for one's country's sake These have to go, to choose without a moment's murmur The sacrificial part, with brow and stern lips firmer Than God's old martyrs at the fiery stake. IX And have ye passed away for ever from us gazing Far into heaven in vain, O hearts and souls amazing, O spirits strong, Who lived and died pursuing a grand mistake (it may be), Yet died for Russia's sake? While morn and night and day be, Your names shall live in Russia's love and song. X Have ye beyond the grave, though black your bridal carriage And black your bridal wreaths, in love's eternal marriage Been joined indeed? Lover, hast thou now heard beyond all death the laughter Of her who sought with thee the perilous hereafter, With love and freedomânought elseâfor a creed? XI Though dark mistakes be there, and doubt and complication, Yet for the people indeed, for the vast iron-bound nation, This man and woman fell: For Freedom's sake their dream (though it were mad) they cherished, And for the oppressed and poor without a groan they perished, First having faced the glittering ranks of hell. XII God is on their side; God, and Love, and all the ringing Of free and spotless waves beneath the morning singing; God present in these things. Yea, when they fell, the sky was darkened as with tender Heart-yearning. Round them falls the omnipresent splendour Of Liberty's large sunset-tinctured wings. XIII Over the bodies of these the Imperial Army trampled. Yet have they left behind a token unexampled: Their dead lips say, âFor Russia's sake we left the safe sweet paths of pleasure: If we were wrong God knows, and knows that past all measure We loved,âpast love of lips that praise and pray. XIV âWe did a cruel deed? Yes: cruel it was then; granted. But who the bitter seeds of cruelty first planted In either breast? Who made with iron black immeasurable oppression Our deep-stung souls revolt and surge past retrogression? Who forced us forth upon the blood-stained quest? XV âWho made the love of country one thing with conspiring, And love of our own race the same thing with desiring To die that it might live? Who made all glad thoughts fade and dark thoughts only attend us, So that our swords alone we trusted to defend us When all defences else were fugitive? XVI âWho made our spirits bleed for friends and neighbours scattered Over the ice-bound steppes,âhimself adored and flattered By a cringing Court the while? If him we have slain, we have slain the mystic incarnation Of Tyranny that crushed the chained and helpless nation And froze all laughter with its deadly smile.â May, 1883. IRELAND TO ENGLAND. I Thou hast set free the slaves o' the world! With pride thou boastest That Freedom follows upon thy keels where'er thou coastest: The strength o' the seas is thine. The free wind whistles through thy copses that front sea-ward, And yet the clank of chains thou hearest, looking meward, And not thy wild wind's voice in fir and pine. II Thy slaves are free, and yet thy dark-haired grey-eyed sister Thou, blue-eyed, golden-haired, though oft thy lips have kissed her In sister-seeming wiseâ Thou guardest as in prison. Each low-browed common varlet Of thine hath now the right, if he be clothed in scarlet, To stare his brutal coarse soul down her eyes. III Her thou hast yielded up, by thy true mood forsaken. At any corner of street her shoulder may be shaken By rough and menial hands. She, once so fair, is now downstricken of heart and bloomless: Her fields of corn and grass are sheenless and flower-plumeless: She, once the fairest, now is least of lands. IV Her mountain-streams run red. In green she used to garb her: But now her soft green fields and sun-bright mountains harbour But two wild bands indeed, Pursuers and pursued,âthe hunters and the hunted. She dares not raise her brow: it shines so crimson-fronted. England has bled. But does not Ireland bleed? V Gifts thou hast given. And yet the gift of all gifts never. Give her her own green fields for ever and for ever! Give, with no grudging hand! Now thou hast traversed all the earth, and all dark places Hast lightened somewhat, pour some light on Irish faces. Turn from the ends of the earth to thine own land. VI Turn from the China seas and Japanese strange waters: Turn from the task of freeing far India's dusky daughters: Turn homeward, now at length. Give unto us the thing that we through wild years long for; The gift that now at last our hearts and hands are strong for; Give,âif it be but token of thy strength. VII By all thine English hills and every English river,â By the far fields of fight wherein with shock and shiver Thy sword and lance have met The sword and lance of far slave-holding state and city,â Let now thy soul, near home, be roused to love and pity.â Thou hast done great deeds. Do one deed greater yet. VIII Do one deed greater yet than all thy history showeth, Though this with strong great deeds brims o'er and over-floweth. Give liberty to me.â Our creeds are not the same in outward passing semblance: Yet are we both fair lands in God's most high remembrance, And circled, both, by God's vast slaveless sea. IX Thou hast stricken off the chains of nation after nation: Thy bayonets fill far lands with hope and exultation; They fill our homes with woe. Bulgarian hands to thee stretch out in prayer and find thee: Greece seeks thee not in vain. O England, look behind thee! How far afield thy love and succour go! X Thou hearest if a serf in Russia groans in bondage. Or if in Poland blood dyes pavement or wet frondage Thou startest up fierce-eyed. Yet blood for years has poured upon our hills and meadows: Groans fill the morning air, and fill the evening shadows. Thou listenest; then dost lightly turn aside. XI Thou art upon the road to Ind or Madagascar. Thou hast heard the cry of some poor tortured dark-skinned lascar. To Borneo thou art bound. Thou hast a Burmese war on hand: or Boers, it may be, Must be set freeâ(In God's great true name, why should they be,â While still our coupling-irons strike the ground?) XII Thou hast within thy House of free debate to settle Whether thine arms shall test the Zulus' warlike mettle, Or try the Afghans' steel. Thou hast to pass a bill to guard the gulls and widgeons, Or to protect the poor blood-stained ill-treated pigeons.â Thou hast no time to give to our appeal. XIII Then when in wild despair we strike, not knowing whither Our random blows may fall, thou sendest armed men hither As if to possess the land. Thou lookest in my eyes. Yes: they are blood-shot truly. Thou lookest at my robe. Yes: it is blood-stained newly. Yes: drops of English blood run down my hand. XIV Yes.âThen thou draggest away whole hosts of men to prison. Next lo! in town and town the black trees have arisen, An evil growth by night. Blood still cries out for blood, and slaughter leads to slaughter. Injustice is the sire, and murder is the daughter; She with the crimson hand, and face quite white. XV So it goes on, and will, till thou at length beholdest The inner truth of things, and thine own flag unfoldest Above the Irish walls. For thine is Freedom's flag: but that black deadly other Grim flag to us thou givest that telleth that another Blood-stained misjudged misjudging patriot falls. XVI Of all the world's strange things it will be deemed hereafter Most strange, that English hearts with ring of martial laughter Fought all the world around For Freedom's sake,âyet fought at home still more to enslave her Their sister, when they should have given their souls to save her: Freed dark arms,âleft their white-armed sister bound. XVII Scotland!âYes: she was freeâthe land of rock and thistle. But thou hast trained her sons to follow at thy whistle: We are not such as they. A race is ever a race. A nation is a nation. No power on earth can join in close amalgamation Two differing races; for one must obey. XVIII Try plan on novel plan: expedient on expedient. Still one must conqueror be; the other race obedient;â Keen swords must threaten or kill. All schemes have but one end. Oh, make an end of scheming! Lo! Ireland waits to be twofold in outward seeming, Then for the first time one in heart and will. XIX We have fought side by side. The Irish legions stood thee In right good stead full oft. Their wild-pulsed strength renewed thee Fainting at Waterloo. And on Crimean hills they shed their life-blood willing. No French or Russian hand our heart's-blood now is spilling: This was reserved for English hands to do. XX We wait, and in the end shall triumph. But we sorrow That the great priceless boon might be conferred to-morrow, Yet blood on blood must flow (It seems) ere thou canst wake to see that gifts but madden, Make bad things worse, enrage and grieve and sting and sadden, When with the gifts the bullet-cases go. XXI Thou art not strong but weak, while we are weak. Thine island Needs guards and watchers now in city, in wood, on highland, Lest red deeds spring to light. Strike off our chains and thou wilt strike a thousand fetters From thine own limbs as well, and write in golden letters Thy name upon our hearts renewed and bright. XXII Our weakness is thine own. Our strength will be thy glory. Lo! while our arms are red, England, thine own are gory, And while our weapons shine Thine dare not seek their sheath. For thine own sake deliver! When women's laughter rings by Irish lake and river Fearless, thou wilt be free, proud sister mine! March, 1883. SONNET XX. âIT IS GOD WE NEED.â Thou needest God.âYes, he can conquer death For thee, and open the eternal gates. For more than man's love thy sweet spirit waits And for far more than the one small rose-wreath That love can give thee. When love's mortal breath Flags, thou dost need the breath that renovates The laughing flowers when night's cold dark abates And when the linnet sings upon the heath. Yes, woman needeth God. I know it well. Because I know that I have not the whole Eternal force to satisfy thy soul I love thee more than I can ever tell.â Woman needs man. Man needeth her. And each Needs God's heart,âsmiling ever out of reach. SONNET XXI. âAND YET WE STRETCH OUR ARMS OUT TO THE HUMAN.â And yet we seek the human.âWhen we tire Of God's great loving limitless embrace And of the features of the endless face,â Yea, when we weary of his passion-fire And of his stern implacable desire, We turn with longing to some grassy place On earth, and 'mid the lilies for a space We rest, and listen to the earth's old lyre. The human love is very very sweet, And there are seasons when the highest rhyme Of kingliest stars would strike as less sublime Than love-songs sung where the brown waters meet On earth, or where rose-tendrils cling and climb.â When God fails, listen for Love's human feet. THE DEEP LOVE. One has to count the cost.âOne cannot win love's sweetnessâ One cannot grasp fair love in absolute completeness Without the pain as well. The sweetest flowers are those which grow not on the mountains But at the solemn edge, and sprinkled by the fountains, Of pain's dim red unfathomable hell. Oh, not the common love is sweetest, but the passion Which bindeth soul to soul in mystic sacred fashion In spite of adverse things. Without pursuit could love exult in priceless capture? No soul can know love's deep immeasurable rapture And yet forego the pain the deep love brings. Feb. 25, 1884. SONNET. CHRIST'S ETERNAL POETHOOD. The Church that made the poet into God Stole his eternal Poethood from him, And lo! his eyes of genius waxÃ¨d dim And flowerless grew the plains his God's foot trod. The batlike blind Church limped along the road He took, and changed to its own image grim The Eastern poet; swathed his every limb With stifling robes, and bound the eyes that glowed. But now the eyes are gleaming forth again: The robes are falling, and his limbs are free: He standeth forth, a soul without a stain, And through his eyes love's light unchangeably Smiles on the men who for his sake are slain To-day by Churches asking âWhere is he?â Jan. 13, 1884. AUTUMN VOICES: SONNETS AND LYRICS. (1883.) I. THE LATER LOVE. Yes: first love was most sweet. But, fourteen long years nearer To death (and God?), one sees all things with vision clearer And larger is the might Of love that gathers force from all the years receding And glances back and back along the roadway bleeding, Till thoughts of past pains fill its eyes with light. So, greater is the love that God and death watch over Now, than the love that wings of meadow-sweet and clover Guarded in early days. And grander is the scent of salt waves large and leaping Than scent of the old pines in mountain-meadows sleeping Under the suns of youth, and their warm rays. The whole soul gathers force, and all the force it gathers Adds to the might of love, and strong love ever fathers Stronger delight and glee: Even as the laughing might of the blue-bubbling river Is nought beside the jests whose strong wings flash and quiver Over the surface of the windy sea. First love is very sweet. But later love is sweeter: For the near face of death adds sweetness to the metre In which the last love sings. Sweet is the touch of love when life is all before us, But sweeter is love's touch when round about and o'er us Rustle the untouched and immortal wings. Sept.. 17, 1883. II. THE ETERNAL BOYHOOD. This I would do, start fresh with thee,âthrough sweet France dreaming, Or marking wealth of blue or purple night-time gleaming In fragrant Italy. Start freshâquite fresh,âI could; and watch the moonlight chasing The sea-bird's pure white wings with laughter and love amazing Across new azure leagues of Southern sea. Yes: I could be a boy again.âI could to-morrow Banish all thoughts of old and sombre-hearted sorrow And enter life anew. Wonder at all the skies, as if the ethereal azure Never, not once before, gave eyes and spirit pleasure: Marvel, as if new-born, at ocean's blue. I could start quite afresh,âyoung, passionate, boy-hearted. God gave the poets youth for ever when he parted, Weary, with all his own. And when God tired of love, he gave the poets power To enter love's bright fields, and gather love's white flower, With all the force that from himself had flown. So I could be quite young. The poppies in the meadows; The tender flower of blue that 'mid the cornstalks' shadows Rests, and it shines between; The iris in the pond; the water-flags, and follies Of the blue-capped titmice amid the yews and hollies; The dusky pinewoods' depths of darkening green; The splendour of the sky; the wonder of great cities; The glory of the moon that soars above and pities The town's dim smoky roar; The summer waves that plash upon the shingly gravel; The wintry white large waves whose threatening swift crests travel Out from wild ocean to the trembling shore; The robin on the rail with plaintive soft note piping; The crimson bars of cloud the lilac background striping When sunset gilds the air:â All this could be as new to me as when God saw it For the first time, without one human pang to flaw it, When first creation shone supremely fair. For the whole world is ever virgin to the poet. The thinker's brain he brings,âbut the boy's heart to know it; The youth's heart to adore:â Sweet as first love to him the world for ever gleameth, And in her deep sweet eyes his answering deep heart dreameth, Full of wild worship,âyes, for evermore. IX. THE SOUL-GAME. This is the game that thrills the giant veins Of God himself with most impassioned life: Soul against soul to balance in wild strife; Heart against heart. No battling warrior gains So fierce a sense of joy as he who drains In the soul-struggle large and sweet and long The cup of passion and the cup of song; Then loosens for the charge his bridle-reins. Command an army? Yes: the joy is large. But far more terrible and far more deep The joy of feeling stern against one's targe A woman's pitiless soul-arrows leap; The joy of holding 'mid the thunderous charge Of passion the soul's battlemented keep. XII. THE SWEETEST LOVE. Yes: marriage-love is sweet. But sweeter far The love that perfect Freedom crowns and brings: The love that underneath the midnight sings And weaves through sorrow's dark locks star on star. The love that though the whole world rose to bar Its kingly road would sweep with fiery wings Far from its path all fierce opposing things And seek the regions where the great souls are. O holiest love of all!âthe love that links Two souls in one for very love's own sake. The love that not time's jarring thunders shake: The love that at heaven's clearest sweet fount drinks: The love that loves till every thought else sinks: The love that bends not, though the heart may break. XXII. AT LAST. I heard a voice that said: âThe time has come. Let the whole line of bayonet-points advanceâ.â I looked around the field with one last glance, And saw once more a blackberry-hedge in bloom. And then through curdled smoke and powdery gloom I saw the quick fires round the cannons dance, And saw wild pennons wave from many a lance, And saw strange helmets flash and mad steeds loom. I drew my sword ere that great final sound âLet the whole line advanceâ had fully past, Tightened my sword-belt, and drew in my breath. Then as the red line with a giant bound Plunged after me, my whole soul laughed at last.â And this was life supreme,âand this was death. Dec. 30, 1883. SONNET. CHRIST'S LOVE. Did Christ love many women? Yes. But he Not only with strong sweet lips held them fast, But with his soul he loved them to the last And with the incarnate pulse of Deity. The spirit of love in him was like a sea, Immutable, eternal, wondrous, vast: Yet when the wave of passionate joy was past, His love throbbed onward through eternity. Christ never lost a love.âHe held his own Safe though the winds of dark time round them rang. No woman whose glad mouth with passion sang, Touched by his mouth, her Master did disown. Through Peter came the treacherous deadly pang: The love of woman made Christ's cross a throne. March 7, 1884. A VISION OF THE DEAD. I Through all my former life as in a dream I passed.âI saw the Dover cliffs again, Where the bright âclouded yellowsâ used to gleam And âazure bluesâ in many a leafy lane. Yet o'er the cliffs when sunset grim and red Flamed, I beheld the faces of the dead. II Keswick I tried. The birch and oak were there; And blue and tranquil Derwentwater shone: O'er the high hills the floating clouds were fair; The moon hung o'er the green glens, sweet and wan. Yet when the golden day had waned and fled, There also I was haunted by the dead. III I went to Paris. The dear city white Was beautiful as ever: by the Seine I wandered, when the sacred starlit night Folded the city in soft peace again. But here too fluttered round about my head Dim pinions of the innumerable dead. IV Nor only my dead. O'er the river wide I seemed a silent breathless host to see: They swept with awful starry gaze, flame-eyed, Around, above, on every side of me. I heard a voice that from the blue air said, âBehold! each live soul hath an host of deadâ. V And through the host one pale majestic face, Crowned like a leader of all men, I saw. A ghostly army at his heels did race: He and his phantom-soldiers smote with awe My spirit:âa gigantic host he led, And yet each warrior of the host was dead. VI Dim bearskins I could see, and helmets bright Over the Seine: and he amid them all Shone with that clear-cut face so deadly-white,â He led the old Guard now without bugle-call. O'er Paris he and they, an army dread, Floated: Napoleon and Napoleon's dead. VII I sought Geneva. Blue and clear the lake Gleamed, and afar Mont Blanc was touched to rose: Still doth the sunsets' fire the mountains take, Breaking their sombre measureless repose. Then all grew dark and darker,âand instead Of stars I saw the star-eyes of the dead. VIII I sought Lausanne: and round about the place Still the old orchards full of quiet charm; Still mountain streamlets run their foaming race, And still the mountains fold with dusky arm The glittering water. From each orchard-shed A grey ghost peeped: some well-loved friend long dead. IX And then to England my sad spirit came, To Whitby: and the old white waves were there, And blue far waters, and the sun's fierce flame, And ferns and green woods,âand a woman fair. Sweeter than words the scent her loose locks shed! And yet here too I communed with the dead. X I went to Oxford. Still the fields were green, And still the yellow marigold most bright Clustered along the frequent dykes was seen, And still the Isis laughed with ripples light. But ah, the old days! For ever each had sped. Old days, old faces . . . all my friends were dead. XI Again I saw the green rough Cornish waves Pour giant masses on the rocky shore; Still in the hollow cliff-side granite caves The maiden-hair lurks hidden as of yore: The brown streams as of old the moorland fed. Yes. But here too I met the cloud of dead. XII I sought the streets of Edinburgh. There Frowned the old castle; all was still the same: Still the same mountains,âmossy rocks and bare: Towards Holyrood one quiet night I came, When lo! the august inevitable tread About my path of legions of pale dead. XIII And midmost these shone Mary, with the eyes That held the hearts of lovers magic-bound: And after her through haunted heights of skies Swept hosts of followers, gliding without sound Along the airs,âand in their looks I read That these were shadows, shadows of the dead. XIV Darnley was there and Bothwell: Chastelard, And pallid Rizzio; and a thousand more. The guarded gates of Holyrood were barred, Yet through the gates their grisly hosts did pour. The sentry's living eyes were dull as lead: He saw not Mary; no, nor Mary's dead. XV Next Balcombe. Quiet undergrowth of firs, And yellow sunsets, and the smell of pines, And purple heather on the green hill-spurs, And red fruit of the withering eglantines. Yes, all was as of old. Yet my heart bled. Here too I heard soft whispers of the dead. XVI Then London. There I wait:âtill I too pass Beyond all flowers and songs to that dim room Where never summer scent of rose or grass Mingles with the dull omnipresent gloom; Till I too join with sombre wings outspread, Their last recruit, the army of the dead. April, 1882. LOVE-LYRICS. (1884.) I. AFTER LONG MONTHS. Straight from the dark of months thy sweet eyes shone upon me And shed the light of suns and light of old stars on me And light of their own flame:â And from them all the sense of Spring-tide crocus-hearted Along my weary soul, swift, on a sudden, darted; And with thy voice the lark's new love-song came. Thou wast the spirit of Spring.âThe sense of grassy meadows And merry leaves that dance and balmier twilight shadows Was born along with thee. All blossoms are not dead,âfor thou art living, lady! So once again the sun will through the foliage shady Strike his long arrows, lighting flower and tree. Thou art alive. By this I know that Spring will follow: Now hyacinths will bloom, and hill and copse and hollow Will gleam with fiery gold. The silent heart of Spring that for thy mandate waited Will break to flower at lastâSpring tortured and belated, Hiding his ferns and flowers in fold on fold. Thou hast the spirit of Spring and Summer's heart within thee: And who would love and hold, and worship thee, and win thee, Must meet the Spring's own eyes Fearless, and Summer's eyes,âand laugh for very pleasure When the bright fields spread out their limitless gold treasure Beneath the cloudless smile of stormless skies. I know that Winter now has passed away before thee. The very heart of May will worship and adore thee And kiss thine hands ere long.â The heart of all the world will come with love and gladness, And silver streams will seek with silver-voiced sweet madness To catch the echo of thy pure heart's song. And once again I lift the lyre the cold had frozen, And laugh to think how soon of all flowers thou the chosen Wilt put the flowers to scorn. When thou dost call on Spring, he wakes and follows after: In thine I hear the ring of very June's own laughter: Thine eyes are lovelier than a summer morn. II. âTHY FACE.â Among the weary crowd of weary common faces I linger,âand I search through flowerless dreary places, Seeking amid the throng One vision worth a thought. Pale Death and Sorrow meet me: Death sues me for a wreath, and Sorrow doth entreat me To crown her wild-haired forehead with a song. Then I take up mine harp, and sing of Death and Sorrow,â Of how the sweetest things are saddest things to-morrow; How pain fills every place; How woe has set its hand upon our city's features; How agony is grooved on brows of human creatures;â Then on a sudden, lady, lo! thy face. Then Death and Sorrow fade, and Pain smooths out before thee Its wrinkled brow. The sun seems ever to cast o'er thee Strange sunlight's ceaseless charm. Greece rises at thy glance; and Youth and Beauty linger Beside thee just to kiss one hand or one white finger, And Life's young red lips kiss thy rounded arm.â I wander through the crowd. I wander gloomy-hearted. Then just as if the sun had on a sudden parted Dense leaves that interlace And smiled with gracious eyes adown the leafy narrows, I weary with the points of daily pain's mute arrows Turn round,âand on a sudden, lo! thy face. III. âBEYOND.â I am so old.âBut thou hast stolen from Spring the power Whereby he clothes in robes of leaf and bud and flower Each new year without fail. Not even Death, I think, could meet thee and not tremble: Yea, surely he would turn, and sorrow and dissemble: At sight of thy flushed cheek his hand would quail. It seems to me that thou hast endless life within thee; That never heart of man, nor poet's heart, must win thee, But souls of flowers and seas: The living voice of Spring within the woods and mountains: The laughter of the morn in rivers and in fountains: The deathless love-song of the thornless breeze: These are thine own.âBut I,âwhat can I bring but sadness? Thou gazest at the plain with young heart full of gladness, The plain so bright with flowers: I see beyond the plain the solemn mountains rising Height beyond awful height, with tiers and shelfs surprising And snow-capped vast indomitable towers. Life's joys are all thine own.âThou gazest at the sunlight: And I with only love for sunshine and for one light Gaze at thee, rapt and fond. Yet ever is it true that thou art gazing only At the broad flowerful plain,âwhile I with vision lonely (So lonely!) mark the unscaled rocks beyond. IV. âNEVER TIRED?â And art thou never tired of poems, and of singing?â âNay! not more tired than Spring of merry bright birds winging Along the woods their way. A woman never tires of love, so it be endless: The summer, full of flowers, would feel forlorn and friendless With one flower less on one acacia spray! âA woman never tires of love, so it be tireless: A woman never tires till passion's soul be fireless And song's heart void of flame. What, do my eyes not speak? Then must my lips make plainer That Song is ever sweet, a gentle-eyed retainer Who follows on the path where Love's feet came? âSing on; and sing of me. Are still my eyes a wonder? Sing till the hushed birds part the leafy boughs in sunder To listen to thy song. A woman's gentle soul of love is never weary: Lo! lover, how the dark with songless hand and dreary Will seek to claim me for its own ere long! âSing, ere the night be here.ââSong woke at her sweet warning, And with the heart of birds and with the wings of morning Stormed through the sunlit skies:â For song can never cease, while dark and pure and tender, Full of the soul of love, and full of light and splendour, Shine ever through song's heart her unchanged eyes. V. IN THE LATER DAYS. So many poets lived, and died, and never found thee!â How countless are the hearts whose loving song had crowned thee Had they but seen thy face!â Now in the later days, when doubt and sorrow darken, And when to whispers strange the pain-crowned poets hearken, For one Time has reserved a nobler place. In these the later days, when through the wild world ringing With shock and clash of strife strange sound of fiery singing Eddies, swift wave on wave; In these the later days, when some are chanting only The soul of man laid waste, and passion's heart left lonely,â While some sing love-songs to the wan-lipped grave; In these the later days, when kings and thrones are falling And when across the waves the fierce storm-birds are calling And answering, one by one; When Revolution's tides are foaming down upon us; When the high mountains shake and temples totter on us And tempests threaten God and mock the sun; In these wild later days, when all is dark and boding; When deadly thoughts are hurled like deadliest shells exploding On pale belief and creed; Strong help and high delight it is to hold a treasure Untouched by all the stormâa gift that none may measureâ A task to which none other may succeed. Through all the storms I hear thy gentle soft voice calling: Amid the fiery rain of storm-bolts round us falling I listen for thy tread: Thou wouldst remain unchanged though all the world around thee Fell at the trump of doom. The Love whose strong hand crowned thee Would hold thee scatheless though the world lay dead. Great help and pure delight it is to worship theeward:â Like turning heart and glance no longer foamward, seaward, But up some valley-glen Full of gold gorse and grass and gentle pink-belled heather, Full of the sense of sun and windless summer weather,â Then, strengthened, meeting the grey waves again. Such is the peace thou bring'st.âIn this wild stormy season, Full of the sound of strife and hints of wrath and treason, It is most glad and sweet To have on me bestowed the priceless charge to sing thee, To love thee and to crown,âto worship thee and bring thee Flowers gathered from betwixt the warriors' feet. Keats, Shelley, Marlowe,âThese would, each, have perished, willing, If only through their hearts thy voice had once gone, thrilling Those fiery hearts to praise. They lived and sang and died, yet never never knew thee! Their swift song followed not, nor might their love pursue thee: They died, and, dying, panted for thy gaze.</field>
