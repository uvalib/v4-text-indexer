The sun, declining from his noon-tide course, His beams now darted with diminish'd force, And, as his milder rays around he threw, Ting'd the light clouds with many a brilliant hue. But, while Mæonia's wide and fertile plain Exulted in his mitigated reign, The mighty forest, which to Mysia's bound From proud Larissa's ramparts stretch'd around, Impervious to his beams, a chequer'd shade Of intermingling light and gloom display'd. O'er its majestic oaks, which circling wide For ages had the tempest's rage defied, Each variegated tint of green and red The hand of autumn had profusely spread, While, 'mid their boughs, the tuneful bird of night, Misguided by the vacillating light, Already chaunted his melodious lay, And prematurely hail'd the close of day. Nor haply could th' unwearying songsters boast A nobler auditor. From Caria's coast Alcimedon, its monarch's princely heir, The forest travers'd, overwhelm'd with care. Still in the west the sun's last radiance glow'd, As wrapt in silent thought he onwards rode, Till at a spot arriv'd, where thro' the wood Two paths diversely stretch'd, in doubt he stood: When suddenly the trampling of a steed, Advancing through a neighb'ring glade with speed, His watchful ear arrested; straight a knight Appear'd, with vizor clos'd, in armour bright, Who starting, plac'd his massive spear in rest, And thus the Prince with furious mien address'd. “Have I then met thee? Dost thou still presume “To brave the wrath on which depends thy doom? “Bestir thyself, or as my vassal yield— “'Tis Orosmanes dares thee to the field. “Immortal pow'rs! My Orosmanes!” cried The Carian Prince, and threw his shield aside— “Still in despite of time and absence dear, “Wield not against Alcimedon thy spear!” “High heav'n be thank'd,” the Mysian King exclaim'd. “No longer now may adverse stars be blam'd. “My heart with joy acknowledges the tie “Which bound us erst in tend'rest amity, “When early youth our kindred feelings fann'd, “And hope her airy edifices plann'd. “Alas! misled by vengeance too long nurs'd, “I blindly took thee for my rival curs'd, “For base Achæmenes. That shield he bore, “Now borne by thee; the same impress it wore—” “Then let just Heav'n,” replied the Prince, “be blest, “Fall'n is thy foe, thy vengeance now may rest. “This morn beneath my victor arm he sank, “His trait'rous blood the neighb'ring greensward drank; “And, as my shield had yielded to his blows, “I seiz'd on his to guard me from my foes. “But now, since long opposing stars once more “Beyond all hope my valued friend restore, “Let us awhile together hold our way. “Much have we both to hear, and much to say; “And what can so relieve a suff'ring heart, “As the kind balm which friendship will impart? “Ere we encounter'd, what was thy intent? “The point to which my lonely travel bent “Was fair Larissa”—“Heav'ns!” exclaim'd the King, “Larissa! Thence my direst torments spring. “Name it no more! Rather than view again “That scene of woe, that theatre of pain, “In this sequester'd spot outstretch'd I'd lie, “Break my torn heart, and breathe my parting sigh!” “Then to some other more congenial place “Let us,” replied the Prince, “our journey trace. “The last pale glimmer of departing day, “Prohibits in these wilds our farther stay.” The sorrowing King in silence gave assent. Thro' briars and brakes their tedious course they bent, Now dimly guided by the waning light, Now lost in gloom and shrouded deep in night. While wand'ring thus their doubtful course they held, The rising breeze into a tempest swell'd, The drifting rain pour'd down a chilling flood, And rolling thunders echo'd thro' the wood; Yet still the Knights, to patient suff'rance train'd, Their way 'mid warring elements maintain'd, 'Till thro' the thickly-tangling boughs what seem'd A dim and waving light uncertain gleam'd. Hailing its welcome guidance, thro' the glade, Now less by brambles chok'd, their course they made, And soon an ancient castle, rising high And widely stretch'd in rugged majesty, Their eager glances met. Its turrets proud Were partly hid by night's encircling shroud, Tho', where a lamp its quiv'ring lustre shed, Terrific, grand and rude the frowning rampart spread. The pendent bugle Caria's chieftain blew, When op'ning wide the creaking portal flew, Where grim and gaunt, of countenance severe, They saw the guardian of the gate appear. “Two knights,” exclaim'd the Prince, “with travel worn, “Crave from thy master's grace a brief sojourn. “Grant us to rest within this friendly wall, “Till the fresh sun our wasted strength recal.” As thus he spoke, with scrutinizing air And scowling glance the churl survey'd the pair; But when the Carian's buckler he perceiv'd, On which a blazon'd tiger was achiev'd, Sudden all colour from his visage fled, While thus with hesitating voice he said— “Th' illustrious chieftain, who o'er these domains “In feudal state his seignory maintains, “Each wand'ring stranger courteously receives, “And all their wants with lib'ral hand relieves. “Till I announce your presence, here, I pray, “Safe from the storm within the portal stay.” Thus saying, 'cross the court his steps he bent, And hurrying to his lord's apartment went, Where by a half-extinguish'd lamp, which shed A melancholy light, with hasty tread The chieftain pac'd, his heart o'er-whelm'd with woe, Breathing his sullen rage in murmurs low. “Hence!” cried he to his vassal, “Hence! Begone! “Leave me to brood on my despair alone!” “My lord Cresphontes,” said the churl, “I come “To hail thee master of that caitiff's doom, “Whose felon prowess, in unhallow'd strife, “This morn depriv'd thy honour'd son of life. “Two stranger knights, led here by fav'ring fate, “Implore admittance at the castle's gate. “One on his arm displays the blazon'd shield, “Borne by thy son in many a hostile field”— “Doth destiny relent,” exclaim'd the chief, “And bring me vengeance to assuage my grief? “Thanks to the star which rules this wish'd-for hour “Hence! Straight conduct them to the western tow'r. “In fancied safety let them there consume “The few short moments which protract their doom.” Back to the gate th' obedient ruffian went, And, as with def'rence to the knights he bent, Their entrance pray'd. They, following where he led, Thro' gloomy courts and long-drawn galleries sped, Till, to the lofty eastern turret brought, Their guide retir'd, nor of his error thought. Scarce had he reach'd the portal, when again From the loud bugle burst a lusty strain: A horseman all in haste, with anxious air, Besought admittance for a lady fair. As still he spoke, the sound of wheels was heard, And at the porch a splendid car appear'd, In which a lady veil'd, of princely mien, Attended by a damsel train, was seen. Soon as the surly guardian of the gate The dame beheld, he pray'd her there await, Till he the pleasure of his lord might learn, And, authoris'd to welcome her, return. Ill could the Chief this new intrusion brook. With hurried voice and limbs with rage which shook, “Curse on the chance,” he cried, “which hither sent “This crew to interrupt my great intent! “But since chivalric usage gives them right “To claim a refuge for the passing night, “Conduct them to the turret most oppos'd “To that in which my victims are inclos'd: “There heedless of what passes let them lie, “While I enact my midnight tragedy.” The caitiff, with this foul instruction fraught, Again the gate with hasten'd footsteps sought, And to alight th' illustrious suppliant pray'd. She readily the wish'd request obey'd. An ag'd esquire, whose locks of silv'ry hue And waving beard half hid his face from view, Walk'd with observant caution by her side. Him with attention fix'd the caitiff ey'd, And oft to gain intelligence essay'd. The hoary senior still short answers made, And closely tended on his princely dame, Till to the western tow'r at length they came. There, minist'ring the aid their toils requir'd, With many a rev'rence low their guide retir'd. The gloomy night its zenith now attain'd, And death-like silence thro' the castle reign'd: No moon-beam quiver'd o'er the turrets grey, No star now glanc'd its dimly-twinkling ray, The owl no more his bootless chase pursued, No more the bat his circling course renew'd: 'Twas murder's own appropriated hour, When only treason, lust, or lawless pow'r Th' impoison'd chalice drugg'd, or leapt the fence, Weak guard of unsuspecting innocence; Guilt only was awake—Fit emblem sure Of that avenging worm, which will endure To rack the sinful soul, when time shall die, Merg'd in the gulph of dark eternity. Cresphontes now, his plan arrang'd, of those Who shar'd his confidence ten felons chose. With these along the shadowy halls he past, The wide courts travers'd and the gall'ries vast, Intent upon his sanguinary aim, Till to the turret in the west he came, Where, as he deem'd, his destin'd victims lay; His stern heart bounding as at wassail gay, And flash'd a smile from his dark scowling eye Of mingled transport and malignity. “Here,” to his followers hastily he said, “Here let your vengeful fury be display'd; “For me, for lost Achæmenes, be shown “Your prowess oft in bloody conflict known. “Break down the barrier which secures the door, “Let those within who slumber wake no more.” Obedient they to his behest unjust Against the feeble barrier rudely thrust. The feeble barrier to their force gave way; And now like wolves they rush'd to seize their prey, When to confront them suddenly appear'd The aged esquire. On high his sword he rear'd, And loudly, while his eye-balls gleam'd with fire, Bad them on peril of their lives retire. They, little daunted by so weak a foe, And heedless of his threats, advanc'd; when lo! With pow'rs at variance with declining age The vet'ran taught them to respect his rage. Casting a glance of fierce disdain around, He levell'd one assassin with the ground, And from another with o'er-pow'ring stroke Sever'd the arm which had the barrier broke. Backward the ruffians fell, impress'd with awe, When age and vigour thus combin'd they saw; Their leader shrank abash'd from his design, And almost deem'd such energy divine. But soon with doubled force his vengeful hate Impell'd him to renew the dread debate, When, suddenly, a youth of visage wan And aspect dignified between them ran. “Hold!” he exclaim'd, “within these blood-stain'd walls, “Where murder still for retribution calls, “Who thus with sacrilegious hands presume “Provoke from angry Heav'n their righteous doom!” Him sternly viewing thus Cresphontes cried: “Such be thy fate, if here thou dar'st abide! “Tempt not my rage, Alcanor!—Hence! Begone! “Here I command—These vassals are mine own.”— “'Tis false,” Alcanor cried, “false as thy soul “By murder stain'd and many a treason foul. “Tremble, thou wretch, if conscience yet or shame “Can wring thee, tremble at Leucaspion's name! “Here as th' avenger of his blood I stand, “His son, his heir—May heav'n direct my hand!” He said, nor long his purpose dread delay'd, But, rushing forward, with up-lifted blade Commenc'd his fierce assault: brief was the fray, For nought the vigour of his arm could stay; Vain prov'd Cresphontes' valour, vain his force, Pierc'd to the heart he fell a lifeless corse. As to avenge his fate his followers press'd, Them with impressive voice the youth address'd. “Hear me, misguided men—A moment pause, “Nor rashly vindicate his guilty cause, “Whose felon hand, with treachery abhorr'd, “The good Leucaspion slew, your rightful lord. “Behold in me his son!”—With wonder fill'd The crew fell back, their clam'rous rage was still'd; Awe-struck they stood, not doubtful of the truth, While in Leucaspion's semblance spoke the youth; For so had beam'd his eye with noble fire, Alike in voice and stature son and sire. While in the western tow'r the din of arms And midnight treasons spread around alarms, The royal pair, 'gainst whom the stern command Of their base host had mov'd his felon band, Unapprehensive of their savage foes, Throughout the night enjoy'd serene repose. At length, when morning's all-reviving ray Gilding the distant hills brought on the day, Soon as her early peal the sky-lark rang, The youthful chieftains from their couches sprang. Their mutual salutations soon as made, Each with solicitude his friend survey'd; For in each manly and expressive face Some heart-corroding grief had left a trace, Which well had 'scap'd remark, save from the few Who were, like them, to early friendship true. Much yearn'd they both to know its secret cause, And oft-times, as they talk'd, a sudden pause Arrested their discourse; till at the last A tender look the Mysian monarch cast Upon his sorrowing friend, and thus, while broke From his own breast a sigh, enquiring spoke. “What moves thee thus, Alcimedon? Hath aught “To thy vex'd heart severe remembrance brought? “If so, to Orosmanes be it known. “To him a friend's afflictions are his own. “If of a hopeless passion thou would'st tell, “My practis'd heart with sympathy can swell, “In each fond sentiment and feeling vie, “Drop tear for tear, and echo sigh for sigh.” Thus spoke the King. The Prince of Caria sigh'd, And after short reflection thus replied. “Three years are almost past, since Mysias' throne, “Thine aged sire deceas'd, became thine own, “And graver duties and an empire's care “To Adramyttium made my friend repair. “Till then, beneath my royal father's care, “How blest were we one common lot to share, “To draw instruction from the same dear source, “Alike our hopes, our fears, our views, our course! “'Twas the first pang my youthful breast had felt: “Still hath my soul on the remembrance dwelt, “When last I press'd thee to my faithful heart, “And curs'd the greatness which should make us part. “To calm the suff'rings which my breast assail'd “Nor cool reflection nor time's balm avail'd; “'Mid servile crowds my heart was still alone, “For joy from Caria's court with thee had flown. “My anxious parent mark'd my alter'd guise, “And shortly bad me, tho' with moisten'd eyes, “His presence quit, and to my friend repair. “So free from self my gen'rous father's care! “Gladly his welcome mandate I obey'd. “The eve was come, each tender duty paid, “When once again thy fav'rite grove I sought. “There as alone of past-gone scenes I thought, “To friendship sacred and to mem'ry dear, “Sudden, loud shrieks of anguish struck mine ear, “And lo! A Knight in harness black incas'd, “On whose broad shield a Dragon was enchas'd, “Urging with armed heel his foaming steed, “Hurried across the plain with breathless speed. “But how can words my consternation paint, “When in his arms, disconsolate and faint, “Aspasia, my lov'd sister, I beheld! “My heart with rage and vengeful fury swell'd; “Against the daring ravisher I flew, “Who to the ground his weeping suppliant threw, “And, goading on his steed to swifter flight, “Plung'd in the wood, and vanish'd from my sight. “Scarce had he left me, when his arm'd esquire “Approaching bad me from the grove retire. “His insolence I answer'd with my sword; “But he, more valiant than his recreant lord, “Awhile maintain'd a desultory fight, “Till issuing from the wood appear'd a knight, “Clad in green armour. Soon as him he view'd, “His bold assault my vig'rous foe renew'd; “But soon the stranger struck him to the ground. “As in red torrents stream'd his blood around, “‘May all,’ the gallant stranger cried, ‘who dare “‘'Gainst their allegiance trait'rous plans prepare, “‘Like thee o'ertaken in their treasons die, “‘Like thee a prey for dogs and vultures lie!’ “Charm'd with his valour which so well had wrought, “When as to thank him for his aid I sought, “The modest courtesy with which he spoke “High estimation in my breast awoke. “Back to the court my sister we convey'd. “When to my father my report I made, “The good Chrysulphus hail'd the knight, and crav'd “To know who thus his lov'd Aspasia sav'd. “‘Hyperbius is my name,’ the knight replied. “‘In fair Pisidia did I erst abide. “‘The warlike deeds of those from whom I sprung, “‘In chant heroic many a bard had sung; “‘Their vaunted praises fir'd my youthful breast, “‘Like them with deathless glory to be blest: “‘I left my native home, and wander'd far, “‘My prompter glory, and my object war, “‘Till hearing of Chrysulphus' martial fame, “‘Hither in search of honour's meed I came; “‘In this most blest, that fate so soon allow'd “‘To pledge the duty which my soul had vow'd.’ “My noble father prais'd his val'rous feat, “His various fortunes made him oft repeat, “And soon, for merit his advance prepar'd, “His confidence the gallant stranger shar'd. “And now the hour of my departure came. “I dropt a tender tear—'twas nature's claim— “When to my reverend sire I bade adieu, “And to my last embrace my sisters flew. “But shortly, from the varied scenes around, “A pleasing cure for my regret I found. “Five days pass'd gaily on, when, as the sun “His course thro' heav'n's wide arch had almost run, “Arriv'd at Hermus' widely-ranging flood, “Whose banks were fring'd with many a waving wood, “On a projecting crag I mounted high, “And, o'er its waters as I cast mine eye, “Admir'd the richly variegated scene; “While fill'd with pleasure, ardent yet serene, “My glowing heart, which ne'er had known a pain, “Beat high with hopes and expectations vain. “Alas, how vain! for now the hour was come, “Which fix'd thy friend's irrevocable doom, “When all his visionary joys should fade, “Blasted by love, by adverse stars betray'd. “Th' attractive prospect still allur'd my sight, “When down the stream advanc'd a pinnace light, “Which bounding o'er its surface swiftly flew, “Mann'd by a gay and well-assorted crew. “Snow-white the sail, by silken cords confin'd, “Golden the streamers waving to the wind, “Wav'd, too, th' embroider'd awning, stretch'd on high, “To mingled sounds of joy and minstrelsy: “All, all combin'd to fix my ardent gaze, “And to its height fond expectation raise. “Near, but apart from damsels fair as those “Who laughing Venus' sportive train compose, “Two females stood, whose vestments rich with gold, “Their nobler state and birth conspicuous told. “Each seem'd a goddess of the chrystal stream, “Or like the vision of a fairy dream, “When flits th' unshackled soul from earth to sky, “Rev'lling in sweet unreal ecstacy. “Both were superior to their sex, but one— “That one, my friend, was nature's paragon! “Her form was matchless, dignified her air, “Whiter than snow her neck, which her loose hair “Wav'd by the breeze now show'd and now conceal'd, “And ev'ry moment beauties new reveal'd. “As pass'd the pinnace, with bewitching glance “On me, who gaz'd as if in speechless trance, “She fixed her eyes of pure celestial blue. “Ye Gods! all heav'n seem'd op'ning to my view! “She smil'd upon me—yes, my friend, she smil'd— “Or was it fancy that my soul beguil'd “In transport rapt?—She view'd me with surprise, “And blushing, not in anger, veil'd her eyes. “Already had their influence reach'd my heart, “Which bounding heav'd to meet the pleasing smart. “She spoke—Her silver voice had music's pow'r “And siren sweetness. As the drooping flow'r “Parch'd by the sun drinks up the balmy dew, “My thirsty soul imbib'd sensations new. “‘Kind friends,’ she said, ‘rest here each weary oar, “‘Bland is the air, romantic is the shore; “‘While by the current we are gently borne, “‘Let's wake yon sleeping echoes with the horn, “‘Then let each voice alternate numbers sing, “‘Or with sweet chorus make the welkin ring.’ “Th' obedient crew receive her soft command, “And float the pinnace nearer to the strand. “A lay begins—I heed it not—Mine ear “Such meaner melody disdains to hear. “Now the full crew a chant symphonious raise— “Hateful the sound which song more sweet delays! “But now those ruby lips breathe forth a strain— “Charm'd is my prison'd soul almost to pain— “Delicious tears my greedy eye-lids fill— “I dash them off that I may see her still, “And drink such poison in the fatal view, “As time can't remedy or scorn subdue! “Smile not, my friend, if kneeling on the ground, “My ardent bosom all to rapture wound, “‘Stay yet,’ I cried ‘Oh! do not thus depart, “‘And with thee take my unresisting heart. “‘Ye pitying winds! compassionate my pain, “‘Swell not the sails, the envious bark detain, “‘Which bears my charmer to some distant shore, “‘Haply to bless my longing eyes no more!’ “I breath'd my supplication to the air— “The breeze, regardless of my fond despair, “Down the smooth stream with force augmented blew, “And soon the pinnace vanish'd from my view! “Now, fir'd by love, upon my steed I leapt; “Skirting the stream, my rapid course I kept, “Till ev'ning's gloom obscur'd the waning light, “And the wide prospect veil'd itself in night. “No longer now my fond pursuit avail'd; “Checking my steed, my fortune I bewail'd, “When good Gerontes, who my youth had train'd, “And o'er my mind ascendance still maintain'd, “Sooth'd my vex'd soul: to search the regions round “He proffer'd, till the fair one should be found. “I yielded license to his kind intent, “And sadly to thy court my progress bent. “But there again fresh disappointment rose: “My Orosmanes, who my mental woes “Would have consol'd, abandoning his realm “Had left his royal mother at the helm. “With gracious welcome she receiv'd her guest, “And, though herself by anxious thought oppress'd, “With varied pleasures sought to ease my care: “But vain her efforts, for thou wast not there!” “My brother, surely,” Mysia's monarch said, “Might well thy proffer'd friendship have repaid. “Ne'er did a youth acquire such early fame: “All Asia echoes Aracynthus' name.” “There adverse fate again,” the prince replied, “To gratify my earnest wish denied; “For, ere at Adramyttium I arriv'd, “Thy court was of its primest grace depriv'd. “In search of thee the gallant prince was gone; “But where he bent his travel was unknown.” “Alas! of all my griefs,” the king rejoin'd, “This chiefly agitates my tortur'd mind. “Could I his fortunes learn, if yet he live, “The wrongs of fate I freely would forgive: “But o'er his destiny impends a cloud, “And myst'ries strange and dark the hero shroud. “Oh that to solve them by protecting Heav'n, “Which form'd such excellence, to me were giv'n! “He was indeed a youth, whose matchless worth “Might dignify the age which gave him birth. “All grace, all virtue, were in him combin'd; “His outward form accorded with his mind; “Perfect in all that knighthood can adorn, “He seem'd for fame and deathless glory born: “Nature had fram'd him in her choicest mould, “Valiant yet gentle, though submissive bold, “A youth in enterprise, in wisdom old. “Forgive, if thus my feelings I obey. “Nature will speak, assert her pow'rful sway, “And claim a brother's tear.—Thy tale resume, “Which makes me anxious for thy future doom.” CANTO II. “Short time,” pursued the prince, “I there sojourn'd, “For soon Gerontes from his quest return'd, “And told that she, whom the gay pinnace bore “Was call'd Lycoris. From the Chian shore “Her sire Archilochus, who, nam'd by thee, “Rules o'er the islands of the western sea, “To king Prothenor's court had sent her, where “With Chariclea and Hermilia fair, “That monarch's daughters, she had dwelt awhile, “And thence return'd to her paternal isle. “As when thick-mantling mists the sky obscure, “From stagnant waters bred and fens impure, “Sudden, if through them dart the sun's bright ray, “The gilded scene more brillant shows and gay, “So vanish'd from my anxious breast its pain, “And hope inticing bade me join her train. “While blissful visions thus my soul inflam'd, “A plan suggested by my love I fram'd. “Gerontes secretly engag'd a bark, “And, soon as ev'ning with her mantle dark “Had veil'd the skies, withdrawing from the court, “With cautious speed we hasten'd to the port. “The crew their unknown passengers receiv'd, “Their swelling canvas spread, their anchor heav'd; “Fair was the gale, the vessel swiftly flew, “And soon the Chian shore appear'd in view. “I leapt upon the strand with eager haste, “And tow'rds the town my quicken'd progress trac'd. “When to its high-embattled walls I came, “I heard a herald with loud voice proclaim “A tournament, and call on ev'ry knight “At morrow's dawn in lists to prove his might. “Rejoic'd I heard; for now, methought, kind chance “Occasion gave, which might my suit advance. “Soon as Aurora's tints illum'd the sky, “And the shrill lark denoted morning nigh, “With acclamations loud the city rang. “With instant ardour from my couch I sprang, “And buckled on my armour, brac'd my shield, “Which now a new and apt impress reveal'd— “A Helianthus flow'r, with petals close, “Turn'd to the sun as in the east it rose, “With a device expressive of my doom— “‘Hid till its beams my faithful breast illume.’ “Now burst a warlike harmony around; “The trumpet's clangor and the drum's hoarse sound, “Mix'd with our steeds' proud neighings, shook the air, “And bade us to the crowded field repair. “None of the knights to me attention gave, “Save one of rev'rend years and aspect grave, “Who, courteously saluting me, enquir'd “If aught of information I desir'd. “‘If one,’ said I, ‘a stranger to this isle, “‘But anxious to partake your glorious toil, “‘Question too far, his error deign excuse. “‘Report, which still her hearers will abuse, “‘Hath widely spread through many a distant coast “‘Lycoris' fame, your island's primest boast. “‘I marvel much that in her rightful place “‘A dame so fair should not the tournay grace “‘Report in this,’ replied he, ‘truly said. “‘Our isle, in beauty fertile, boasts no maid, “‘Who with the fair Lycoris can compete; “‘So just her form, her features so complete. “‘Perfect had been our festival this morn, “‘Could charms like her's the splendid scene adorn; “‘But, from Larissa since the fair return'd, “‘The wond'ring court her absence still has mourn'd. “‘Expect not then with scarf or chaplet bright “‘Her lovely hand shall grace the victor knight.’ “As thus he spake, Archilochus appear'd. “A thousand clam'rous tongues his entrance cheer'd. “Soon as was still'd their cry, with prelude loud “A trumpet's pealing note gave challenge proud. “All silent stood, in expectation lost, “When suddenly the field a champion cross'd, “In burnish'd arms array'd, his spear in rest, “His helm surmounted by a tow'ring crest; “A shield he bore, on which with gold enchas'd “A tiger on a verdant field was trac'd—” “Heav'ns!” Orosmanes cried, “that shield I know. “'Twas the device of my detested foe; “It is the same which on thine arm I spied—” “Well hast thou guess'd,” Alcimedon replied. “Ere long a trumpet answer'd his appeal. “A youthful knight, array'd in polish'd steel, “Enter'd the lists. Not long the contest prov'd; “Him from his seat the first encounter mov'd. “The aged knight, who still beside me stood, “And anxiously the combat's issue view'd, “Now forwards rushing, with an outcry loud “And cheeks with tears bedew'd, broke through the crowd. “‘Alas! my son, too rashly brave,’ he cried, “‘Why was his prowess by thy youth defied? “‘Oh that some chieftain, more expert and strong, “‘Would hear my pray'r and vindicate thy wrong! “‘Had valiant Melixertes here remain'd, “‘He had the honour of my name sustain'd—’ “‘That charge be mine,’ I instantly replied, “‘Just is thy cause, and heav'n my arm will guide.’ “I said, and bad a proud defiance sound. “Surpris'd, the stern Achæmenes look'd round, “And gazing on me with profound disdain, “‘Am I,’ cried he, ‘to match with boys again? “‘Give me a man, who may awhile withstand “‘The whelming force of my experienc'd hand!’ “‘'Tis not,’ said I, ‘an empty boaster's vaunt “‘Nor war of words a foe like me can daunt. “‘Come on! The trophies which thy name adorn “‘Shall henceforth on my victor crest be borne.’ “Thus saying, in the rest my lance I plac'd, “And wheeling round my course impetuous trac'd. “Long time we eagerly maintain'd the strife, “As if content to purchase fame with life, “Till, by kind fortune favour'd, from his seat “I drove my foe, and laid him at my feet. “While from the barrier his esquires convey'd “Their senseless lord upon his buckler laid, “The marshals of the lists with def'rence meet “Led me between them to the splendid seat, “Where sat Archilochus in princely state. “He for my salutation did not wait, “But caught me in his arms, extoll'd my fame, “And ask'd with eagerness my rank and name. “‘The name I bear is Thrasylus—’ I said, “Nor more could add; for blushes overspread “My cheek, from shame involuntary sprung, “To find my heart at variance with my tongue. “The chieftain press'd me to remain awhile, “And taste the varied pleasures of his isle, “And, if at wealth or rank my wishes aim'd, “To be the patron of my fortunes claim'd. “Rejoic'd that thus success had crown'd my hope, “To love's fond dream I gave unbounded scope: “With plans of future bliss my soul was fir'd, “When from the chieftain's presence I retir'd “With good Acastus, the time-stricken knight, “Who would my trivial services requite, “And kindly made me in serene repose “The day eventful in his mansion close. “Soon as was o'er our hospitable meal, “Though much I wish'd Acastus would reveal “Whate'er he knew, or fitly might relate “Of fair Lycoris' now mysterious state, “My fault'ring tongue refus'd to speak her name, “Lest my confusion should disclose my flame: “Of Melixertes' worth I therefore spoke, “Whose name I heard him in the lists invoke. “As I enquir'd, the good Acastus sigh'd, “And thus responsive to my wish replied. “‘With his old sire, a chief well known to fame, “‘Here when a youth brave Melixertes came. “‘As he to manhood grew, in him combin'd “‘Seem'd ev'ry grace of form and gift of mind. “‘While others scarcely panted yet for fame, “‘Deeds of renown had signaliz'd his name; “‘But 'gainst the Saracens, whose barb'rous host “‘Had gain'd a station on Icaria's coast, “‘And 'gainst our isle an armament array'd, “‘Were his heroic efforts most display'd. “‘Their hostile shore intrepidly he sought, “‘And there so valiantly and wisely wrought, “‘That in their port he burn'd their pow'rful fleet; “‘And, what his glory render'd more complete, “‘Hyrcanes, who presided o'er their crew, “‘With his own hand in single combat slew. “‘With conquest crown'd, to Chios he return'd; “‘But, while still fresh the laurels he had earn'd, “‘From this proud eminence at once he fell. “‘All wept his fate, but none its cause can tell. “‘At midnight seiz'd, to a lone dungeon sent, “‘Where watchful guards all intercourse prevent, “‘Unseen he languishes. If thou'st a heart “‘Which can in virtue's suff'rings bear a part, “‘Pay to his worth the tribute of a sigh!’ “He said, and waiting not for a reply, “With air of grief demonstrative arose, “And, warning me 'twas time to seek repose, “To mine apartment courteously he led, “Where soon oblivion o'er my senses spread. “But soon Gerontes on my slumbers broke, “And thus with air mysterious briefly spoke. “‘A damsel veil'd, who seeks from thee relief, “‘Requests admittance and an audience brief.’ “‘The hour for audience,’ cried I, ‘though unfit, “‘Return, and straight the suppliant fair admit.’ “With zeal and speed my order he obey'd, “And to my presence led a graceful maid, “Who crav'd my private ear. I straight complied; “When thus she spoke, and, as she spoke, she sigh'd. “‘From the sad victim of a doom severe “‘I, as an humble supplicant, appear, “‘And, to thine honour trusting, thus relate “‘The mournful story of Lycoris' fate.’ “‘Lycoris! heav'nly pow'rs!’ quick I exclaim'd, “‘What impious hand hath 'gainst her safety aim'd?’ “‘Since her first budding charms,’ said she, ‘gave room “‘To hope perfection from maturer bloom, “‘Her sire spar'd nought which might her grace improve, “‘And render worthy of a monarch's love. “‘And now he deem'd the fav'ring time arriv'd “‘To perfect all his plans with skill contriv'd, “‘When his pure flame brave Melixertes own'd, “‘And fair Lycoris' love his passion crown'd. “‘Their mutual tenderness, but ill conceal'd, “‘To stern Archilochus was soon reveal'd. “‘He the resentment which inflam'd his breast “‘By no exterior sign of wrath express'd, “‘But, while with specious semblance of content “‘His daughter to Mæonia's court he sent, “‘Brave Melixertes, without cause assign'd, “‘In a sequester'd dungeon he confin'd. “‘Lycoris now return'd at his command: “‘Her, soon as landed on our Chian strand, “‘To a secluded castle he convey'd, “‘Where since a lonely pris'ner hath she stay'd. “‘Were her afflictions to herself confin'd, “‘To fate's worst rigour she might be resign'd; “‘But ah! too well her sire's stern heart she knows, “‘What dread effect from his resentment flows, “‘And, while her pray'rs to succouring heav'n ascend, “‘She trusts thy valour will her love befriend, “‘That thou wilt grant the boon her sorrows crave, “‘And from impending death her Melixertes save.’ “‘No more,—’ cried I,—‘tell the afflicted fair, “‘That in her cause by heav'n's high pow'rs I swear “‘My heart is listed: come what danger will, “‘My arm her gen'rous wishes shall fulfil.’ “I said. She thankful from my presence went, “While with conflicting pangs my heart was rent. “But short the time which for debate I took. “Since now all hope my tortur'd breast forsook, “I deem'd it glorious to assist the fair, “And him she lov'd to rescue from despair; “Resign'd to fate, if from her eye a tear “Should pitying fall to decorate my bier. “The time for desp'rate purposes seem'd apt: “In gloomy mists the firmament was wrapt; “No twinkling star, no planet's glancing light, “Beam'd through the thickly-shrouding veil of night; “The watch-dog bay'd no more; the wearied guard “No longer in the desert streets kept ward; “The citizens were lost in sleep profound, “And one still solemn silence reign'd around. “Grasping our swords, in armour light encas'd, “Gerontes and myself with heedful haste “Pass'd through the gate. Not far remote there stood “In darkness cloath'd a wide-extending wood, “Mid whose recess the time-worn fortress lay, “Where Melixertes pin'd his hours away. “Of horror and despair it seem'd th' abode; “Scarce thro' the gloom its rugged ramparts shew'd, “Where, mid the ivy on their range which clung, “Night's whooting chorister her vespers sung, “Or, flitting with slow pinion through the shade, “In search of prey her shrieking circuit made. “I bad Gerontes my return await, “If to return should be allow'd by fate, “And scal'd the crumbling wall. Still silence reign'd. “With quick descent the castle-court I gain'd. “Gazing around I cautiously advanc'd, “When from a door half-clos'd a dim lamp glanc'd. “Assisted by the feeble glare it cast, “The portal with observant heed I pass'd, “When in a vaulted chamber I survey'd “A sleeping warrior on a pallet laid, “Near whom a massive key, embrown'd with rust, “Was plac'd, fit emblem of his hateful trust. “Not more relief the storm-vex'd seaman knows, “When round his bark th' o'erwhelming tempest blows, “Should the same flash, which gilds th' infuriate main, “Disclose the port which long he sought in vain, “Than now my bosom fill'd. Gently I stept— “Profoundly still th' unconscious warder slept. “I seiz'd the pond'rous key, and with the lamp, “Which faintly gleam'd thro' the surrounding damp, “Enter'd a vaulted passage, straight and long, “Which led me to a door with gratings strong. “With care the key I turn'd; the lock obey'd: “The portal op'ning to my view display'd “A dreary cavern, suitable abode “For noxious scorpions or the loathsome toad, “Where with chains loaded, stretch'd upon the ground, “The envied object of my search I found. “Soon as my lamp's uncertain beam he spied, “Sighing he rais'd himself, and feebly cried, “‘Leave me in solitude to nurse my woe, “‘'Tis the sole boon which fate can now bestow!’ “‘Silence!’ I said. ‘Behold in me a friend, “‘To loose thy bonds and bid thy suff'rings end.’ “In wonder lost he gaz'd while thus I spoke. “As I the fetters which confin'd him broke, “‘Let us not lose,’ I cried, ‘the fav'ring time; “‘Follow! with me the castle's ramparts climb: “‘Use the best means which pitying Heav'n provides, “‘Which love assists, and fair Lycoris guides.’ “Awaiting no reply, the friendly lamp “Seizing again, I cross'd the dungeon damp, “And, making sign of silence, held my way “Across the chamber where the warder lay. “Closely the rescued knight my steps pursued; “We scal'd the wall, and soon Gerontes view'd. “Not long we stay'd; for now the eastern sky “Ting'd with faint light proclaim'd the morning nigh. “Shrouded amid the wood's deep-mantling shade, “Our hasten'd course thro' briars and brakes we made, “Till in a dark recess, by mountains steep “And trees half hid, we gain'd a cavern deep. “Conscious that here we could not long remain, “I bad Gerontes straight the city gain, “And urge my host to send three coursers fleet, “And hold a bark prepar'd for our retreat. “While thus alone with Melixertes left, “Of ev'ry joy, but virtue's meed, bereft, “‘Tell me,’ he cried, ‘thou noblest of the brave, “‘Whence rose in thee the gen'rous wish to save “‘Which binds my soul to thine? What urg'd my claim? “‘Why didst thou speak the fair Lycoris' name?’ “As thus he said, in his demeanour fair, “His courteous bearing and ingenuous air, “I mark'd the truth of what Acastus said; “And, though in him a rival I survey'd, “A favour'd rival too, my heart, my eye “Confess'd his worth, confess'd it with a sigh! “As I narrated his Lycoris' state “And pow'rful pray'r to save him from his fate, “A tender softness o'er his features stole, “Interpreter of his enamour'd soul. “But need I to my feeling friend impart “Th' effusions of a brave and gen'rous heart, “Impress'd at once with gratitude and love, “The mast'ring passions which a hero move? “Who can so well those sentiments pourtray, “As thou, o'er whom they bear such potent sway? “As yet we spoke, Acastus' voice we hail'd, “And with him came the graceful damsel veil'd, “Who had my succour from Lycoris sought. “On Melixertes how her presence wrought! “How of his love he eagerly enquir'd, “What eloquence remembrance fond inspir'd, “Ill can I speak, for in my phrenzied soul “Contending passions mock'd my weak controul: “But when, for forcibly the youth could plead, “The damsel, by his suff'rings mov'd, agreed “To guide him to the tow'r, where hid from day “In cheerless solitude Lycoris lay, “And when with courteous earnestness he pray'd “I would attend him to the sorrowing maid, “Faintness came o'er my agitated frame. “But soon the unworthy feeling I o'ercame: “‘Lead on,’ I cried; ‘since I thy fortunes share, “‘What Fate inflicts with constancy I'll bear.’ “We hasten'd to Lycoris' sad retreat, “Where Melixertes, falling at her feet, “All the fond ardour of his am'rous breast “In fervid terms of ecstacy express'd. “O'er him she bow'd; then, as her head she rais'd, “On me, who stood behind, a moment gaz'd. “With trembling eagerness on her mine eyes “Intent I fix'd: but what my blest surprise, “When, stead of her, whose loveliness remain'd “Fix'd in my heart and there supremely reign'd, “A stranger I beheld! Beauteous indeed, “Whose charms the common level might exceed, “But which, compar'd with those of my unknown, “Faint and eclips'd with feebler lustre shone. “A while in mute astonishment I stood; “But soon across my raptur'd mind a flood “Of pleasing visions in succession pass'd— “This bar remov'd, I might be blest at last— “Might in some other clime my fair one meet— “So whisper'd hope, so breath'd illusion sweet! “Thus feels the youth, when thrown upon the shore “He ne'er had look'd to reach in safety more, “Though life and hope are all the wreck concedes, “His grateful soul no thought inferior heeds. “While these sensations through my bosom glanc'd, “To greet the fair Lycoris I advanc'd, “Trusting to learn the unknown beauty's name, “Who with her down the stream of Hermus came, “When, with an eager and distracted air, “The damsel ent'ring cried, ‘For flight prepare! “‘Archilochus knows all, his troops around “‘Circle the city and wide forest's bound; “‘A price is fix'd on Melixertes' head, “‘And here himself he comes with vengeful speed. “‘Fly, Melixertes, fly! Ere yet too late “‘Urge thy fleet steed, and shun impending fate!’ “As thus she said, a bugle's warning cry “Proclaim'd that stern Archilochus was nigh. “His last adieu sad Melixertes spoke, “And from his weeping love unwilling broke. “Quick to the bark, provoking all their speed, “We tax'd the vigour of each gallant steed: “All was prepar'd; on board we quickly leapt, “And soon, remote from shore, green ocean's waves we swept. “As o'er the deep our bark swift-bounding flew, “And tow'rds the coast of Samos' isle we drew, “Advancing with a fav'ring wind and tide “Three Saracenic vessels we espied, “Equipp'd for war: on the throng'd decks there stood “The pirate crews inur'd to deeds of blood. “Down bore they on us with exulting cries, “Assur'd to make our feeble bark their prize: “They reach'd us soon, and we, encircled round, “Our only hope in desperation found. “Three times did we their savage ardour check, “And boldly drove them from our crimson'd deck. “What more ensued I know not. From the trance “Of temporary death, in which the lance “Of a fierce foe had laid me, when I woke, “Stilness prevail'd; but soon around me broke “Sounds indistinct, as if of woe and pain. “I strove to raise myself, but strove in vain, “For heavy fetters held me to the ground. “Casting my melancholy eyes around, “Gerontes, Melixertes, and a few “Who form'd the remnant of our Chian crew, “Like me extended on the pavement rude, “And fasten'd down with pond'rous chains, I view'd. “All night in rumination sad I lay, “Our fate bewailing, till, at dawn of day, “A savage band unbarr'd our dungeon's gate, “Unlock'd our chains, and led us to our fate. “From the throng'd multitude loud shouts arose, “When, from the foremost of our barb'rous foes, “A ruffian, whose gaunt visage shew'd him pleas'd “With deeds of blood, brave Melixertes seiz'd, “And led him to a scaffold's dread ascent: “But ere he perpetrated his intent, “A youth of mien commanding forward press'd, “And thus the clam'rous multitude address'd. “‘Hold! For a while the sword of vengeance stay! “‘Ye all remember the disastrous day, “‘When ye beheld Hyrcanes, my lov'd sire, “‘By Melixertes foully struck, expire. “‘On me, his son, his injur'd spirit calls, “‘On me the right of filial vengeance falls; “‘In heav'n recorded is the vow I made, “‘By his assassin's death to appease his shade. “‘I recognize him here: such was his face, “‘And such his manly front and martial grace. “‘Him I demand as my appropriate prize: “‘By Dorimenes' hand alone he dies.” “‘Fair is thy claim,’ a rugged chieftain cried, “‘'Tis just that thou his destiny decide. “‘Hence with the rest of those who form his train! “‘Let them to grace thy sacrifice remain.’ “Throughout the crowd approving clamours run: “They gave his victim to Hyrcanes' son, “While to secluded dungeons us they sent, “There to abide our fate, in darkness pent. “Time slowly pass'd, and hope my breast forsook, “When, as I pensive lay, loud outcries shook “My cell's firm fabric; with discordant jar, “As if of combatants engag'd in war, “Echo'd its dark recesses, when a stroke “Of giant potency its portal broke, “And rushing in a youthful knight appear'd. “A scymitar with blood distain'd he rear'd; “No helm with envious shade his face conceal'd, “Which such expressive sentiment reveal'd, “Such sweetness, such commanding dignity, “That, as I gaz'd on him with wond'ring eye, “He seem'd a seraph, sent from heav'n to bear “To suff'ring man relief from pain and care. “‘Thus,’ he exclaim'd ‘thy galling bonds I break! “‘Arise! with me these gloomy walls forsake!’ “No more he added, nor requir'd I more, “But, following, as he led, soon pass'd the door, “Where with augmented joy my bosom swell'd, “When free and arm'd Gerontes I beheld. “We reach'd a bark which in the harbour lay, “And o'er the briny deep pursued our way. “Now to the varied feelings of my breast “Giving free scope, I thus the chief address'd. “‘That life, which solely to thy gen'rous hand “‘Its preservation owes, brave Sir, command. “‘Instruct me how I may discharge a debt, “‘Which, while life lasts, I never can forget. “‘Yet, though the sum immense I ne'er can pay, “‘Thy courtesy may yet increase it. Say “‘By whom such matchless gallantry was shewn, “‘Such gen'rous enterprise for one unknown.” “‘My happy services,’ the chieftain said, “‘With less acknowlegement were well repaid: “‘I'm fortune's debtor, since to me she gave “‘The means of rescuing a knight so brave. “‘Perinthus is the name I bear; a name “‘As yet by few achievements known to fame. “‘My course near Samos yester-morn I held, “‘When, with its sail by fav'ring breezes swell'd, “‘A bark approach'd, from which I learn'd thy state. “‘I vow'd to rescue thee, or share thy fate.’ “What I replied, or how throughout the day “With the brave youth I talk'd, I need not say. “On ev'ry topic, trivial or profound, “Whate'er he said with eloquence was crown'd: “Nought, from his glance intuitive could scape; “To what was known before he gave new shape, “And all that from his own perceptions sprung “Conviction bore when falling from his tongue. “Such talents, deck'd with modesty so rare, “A form so perfect, and a face so fair, “Seem'd more than human, or, if human, shew'd “A nature with superior gifts endow'd. “Ah why, when thus in life's first op'ning morn “Acquirements, such as manhood might adorn, “Already in this youthful hero bloom'd, “To premature destruction was he doom'd! “Why did I know him but to weep his fate, “And with his excellence his loss relate! “The sun at ev'ning, rob'd in fiery red, “Of coming storms gave intimation dread. “With clouds sulphureous heav'n's wide arch was fill'd; “The curling billows sank; the breeze was still'd; “Ocean's broad face with varied tints was streak'd; “Sadly the cormorant and osprey shriek'd, “And, as anticipating suff'rings nigh, “His cumb'rous form the porpoise heav'd on high. “Terrific pause! Dread interval between “The world we dwell on and the world unseen! “Not long our horrible suspense remain'd. “Soon with a blast, that ev'ry timber strain'd, “And all the practis'd seamen's skill controul'd, “Onwards the devastating tempest roll'd. “The horizon all around was wrapt in gloom; “The mountain billows menac'd instant doom; “From ev'ry quarter vivid light'nings flash'd; “With roar astounding pealing thunders crash'd; “Each warring element its place forsook, “And struggling nature in convulsion shook. “Undaunted by the view of perils dread, “Which round about, above, below us spread, “Perinthus stood, and gaz'd on all unmov'd. “‘My friend, too lately known, too soon belov'd, “‘Farewell!’ he cried, ‘fate calls us hence away; “‘Humanity's last debt we now must pay. “‘Let us like men discharge it, and fulfil “‘With decent firmness Heaven's almighty will. “‘My life I held but as a sacred trust: “‘Its giver is omnipotent and just; “‘On him depending, in his mercy bold, “‘His summons dread I unappall'd behold.’ “Still spoke he, when an overwhelming blast “Upon a rock our shatter'd vessel cast. “The yawning billows swallow'd up the crew, “And brave Perinthus vanish'd from my view! “Deep in the foaming element I sank, “And largely of the briny flood I drank; “But soon as from th' unfathom'd gulph again “Aloft I rose, I buffetted the main, “Till, quite exhausted by th' unequal strife, “And nearly past each flatt'ring hope of life, “I saw Gerontes on a shiver'd mast, “Which by the billows driv'n approach'd me fast. “Aided by him, the frail support I gain'd, “And, spite of ocean's rage, my post maintain'd. “Soon pass'd a bark. When as its crew perceiv'd “Our peril, instant they our woes reliev'd, “And to our wants administer'd their aid, “As to Byzantium we our progress made. “At that vast capital arriv'd, awhile “I rested, overcome by recent toil, “Weigh'd down by sadness too, which o'er me stole, “And mid my thanks for life depress'd my soul. “What fate was mine! Toss'd still from port to port, “My heart of every conflict made the sport— “My love unblest by one directing ray— “My sicken'd hope, that smil'd but to betray— “Brave Melixertes dead—Perinthus lost— “Their friendship, gain'd at such heroic cost, “Lent like twin meteors to my dazzled eyes, “To set in darkness mid their kindred skies! “What could I hope from time's prolific womb, “Save future sorrows or an early tomb? “But love and friendship soon resum'd their claim; “I thought of Hermus' banks and Orosmanes' name. “By better omens thus inspir'd, at last “Through rich Bithynia's provinces I pass'd, “And journeying on, towards Phrygia as I drew, “A gallant knight approaching met my view. “Curbing his vigorous steed on me he gaz'd, “Then, as the vizor of his helm he rais'd, “‘What thanks to fav'ring heav'n are due!’ he cried, “‘Which hither deign'd my toilsome progress guide! “‘Let thine Hyperbius hail the welcome day, “‘When once again he may his homage pay—’ “‘Thy presence,’ I exclaim'd, ‘with joy I greet, “‘And thank the happy chance which made us meet: “‘But tell me what unknown, what pow'rful cause “‘Thus far my friend from Caria's frontier draws?’ “‘Of import grave must be the cause,’ he said, “‘Which from that blest abode my footsteps led. “‘To thee, not less than to myself, belongs “‘The vindication of thy father's wrongs; “‘If in Aspasia's cause I arm, no less “‘Wilt thou, brave prince, her injuries redress. “‘Haply thou hast not the transactions heard, “‘Which in Bithynia's troubled court occurr'd, “‘When Prince Artaces, whose aspiring soul “‘Spurn'd at his royal brother's just controul, “‘Commotion rais'd, till, his foul treason foil'd, “‘He was by sentence merciful exil'd. “‘Then suppliant to Miletus he repair'd, “‘Where soon thy gen'rous father's grace he shar'd. “‘Oh! that to one more worthy of his aid “‘His kind beneficence had been display'd, “‘That fate had ne'er conducted to his coast “‘One so deprav'd, to gratitude so lost! “‘His specious worth too soon Aspasia own'd; “‘Thy sire's consent his hopes ambitious crown'd: “‘But scarce wilt thou believe the tale I tell— “‘From faith, from duty the false recreant fell, “‘When, by his brother's death, was op'd the way “‘To brighter prospects of imperial sway. “‘Quitting Miletus, he address'd a scroll “‘To thy wrong'd sister, which unmask'd his soul. “‘Its purport bore that now, his throne secur'd, “‘The faith to her once plighted he abjur'd, “‘Resolv'd with some more lov'd and lovely fair “‘To form alliance and his sceptre share. “‘Such were his cruel words! The rest suppose, “‘What were Chrysulphus' rage, Aspasia's woes. “‘My heart, attach'd to them by ev'ry tie “‘Of gratitude, respect, and loyalty, “‘Ill brook'd a conduct so replete with shame, “‘And so injurious to thy sister's fame. “‘In secret leaving Caria's court, with speed “‘To reach the recreant prince I urg'd my steed.’— “As thus he spoke my agitated soul, “With indignation fill'd beyond controul, “Could find no utt'rance for its feelings strong. “At length I cried, ‘To avenge my sister's wrong, “‘Throughout the world the traitor will I seek, “‘And on his head proportion'd vengeance wreak.’ “‘Since I such part in thy resentment bear, “‘Let me,’ said he, ‘thy gen'rous labours share. “‘Do thou thy progress through Mæonia make, “‘While I my circuit through Bithynia take.’ “What need of more? I gave my full assent. “We parted, each on sep'rate travel bent. “I know not what success his efforts crown'd: “No tidings heard I, and no traces found “To guide my search; yet still, by rage impell'd, “With unabated zeal my course I held, “Till in the wood, which circles this abode, “A knight I met, who in full armour rode. “The well-known tiger, which adorn'd his shield, “My former foe Achæmenes reveal'd. “Soon as he saw me, with a haughty air “He bade me for immediate fight prepare. “Short prov'd the fray, my spear his corslet pierc'd, “And the proud challenger to earth revers'd. “I seiz'd his shield, unconscious it might prove “The source of discord with the friend I love.” CANTO III. When to a close the Prince his story brought, Awhile the Mysian King remain'd in thought; At length he cried, “How harsh soe'er thy fate, “Thou wast not victim of thy fair one's hate, “Thou didst not reach the op'ning gate of heav'n, “Thence by an angel's mandate to be driv'n. “O that such mercy had to me been shewn! “Had I such healing consolation known, “My youth, just op'ning into bloom, had ne'er “Been blighted by incurable despair.” “To speak the pains which suff'ring hearts endure,” Replied the Prince, “may haply aid their cure. “Canst thou, my Orosmanes, nurse a care, “Which my responsive bosom will not share?” “Why should I not,” replied the King, “relate “The sad occurrences which mark my fate? “Why, like the boy, who, on a torrent's verge, “Trembling draws back, nor dares the effort urge, “Should I more pain from apprehension know, “Than any which from real peril flow? “When, at my father's death, the Mysian throne “With its attendant cares became mine own, “My gallant nobles, who with ardour strove “To manifest their loyalty and love, “Besought me, by the veneration high “In which they held my royal ancestry, “To give them hope of a succession sure, “Which to far distant ages might endure. “Of many a fair in foreign courts they told, “Of beauties in fame's register enroll'd; “But most of Chariclea's matchless grace, “Her form unrivall'd and angelic face, “They spoke, as she who of our Asian dames “To my selection had the strongest claims; “And who, endow'd with ev'ry gift that decks “Exalted rank or decorates the sex, “Presumptive heiress of Mæonia's throne, “Seem'd as by fate design'd for me alone. “To all they said of the transcendent maid “I for a time but small attention paid; “For then my heart, a stranger to the pains “Which wring the breast where love despotic reigns, “Revell'd in false security, nor knew “How various were his pangs, his joys how few. “Yet still their oft-reiterated praise “Would in my mind a soft emotion raise, “And fancy, now awaken'd, would essay “This paragon of beauty to pourtray, “Till by the fascinating picture mov'd, “The model she had form'd I almost lov'd; “And so insidiously the poison run “Through my rapt heart, and such ascendance won, “That I resolv'd to view the peerless dame, “And judge how far she merited her fame. “Taking advantage of a murky night, “When neither moon nor stars afforded light, “A letter to my mother I address'd. “Nought of my secret purpose I express'd, “But pray'd she would o'er Mysia's realms preside, “Direct its counsels, its resources guide, “And spoke such tenderness as might controul “The fears that wound an anxious parent's soul: “Then, mounting my good steed, without delay “My rapid course pursued till close of day. “Within a spreading forest, whose deep shade “By doubtful twilight was more solemn made, “An humble cot I saw, with eglantine, “The fragrant briar and the blushing vine “Half hid from view. Before its lattic'd gate “An aged pair in cheerful converse sat, “Who tranquilly the ev'ning breeze enjoy'd; “And near them stood a youth, who, tho' employ'd “In rustic cares, with voice mellifluous sang “Sweet melodies, with which the woodlands rang. “As I approaching ask'd reception fair, “The youth his chant gave o'er, and with an air “Which spoke his admiration and surprise, “While transport beam'd from his expressive eyes, “‘Father!’ he cried, ‘behold this gallant knight, “‘His helm how gay, his shield and mail how bright! “‘Oh when shall I such splendid arms receive, “‘When shall I deeds heroical achieve, “‘Which might from dark oblivion snatch my name, “‘And crown my humble birth with deathless fame!’ “‘Thou silly boy,’ his sire replied, ‘retire; “‘Hence to the mead, our sheep thy care require. “‘Ill with our state such tow'ring hopes agree. “‘To tend our flock is fitter charge for thee.’ “The blushing youth in silence droop'd his head, “Heav'd a deep sigh, and hasten'd to the mead. “I ask'd the shepherd why his son he chid, “And to discourse of chivalry forbid. “‘A youth,’ said he, ‘in lowly station born, “‘Should not uncheck'd that lowly station scorn. “‘That boy, I grieve to say, takes no delight “‘To listen, when we rustic tales recite; “‘But if a minstrel, as he holds his way “‘To some baronial court, should hither stray, “‘And, as his ready finger sweeps the string, “‘Of martial feats and knightly worth should sing, “‘A sudden phrenzy rushes o'er his soul, “‘His colour mounts, his sparkling eye-balls roll, “‘Up from his seat he starts, with furious look “‘He treads as if on air, and brandishes his crook.’ “With fruits, meantime, and milk, and oaten bread “The humble table of my host was spread. “His labours o'er, his fleecy charge resign'd, “Again the gallant youth our party join'd. “Gay was our converse as the mead we quaff'd, “And much the senior jok'd and much he laugh'd, “Yet still the youth, when mirth most loudly reign'd, “His pensive air and wond'ring gaze maintain'd, “And oft the splendour of my arms admir'd, “The name, the use, of ev'ry piece enquir'd, “Till evening's shade in ebon night had clos'd, “And all, save I, in slumbers deep repos'd. “My mind recall'd, when on my pallet laid, “All the fair youth of chivalry had said, “His wish aspiring and his low estate; “With these contrasting all that might await “My introduction at Prothenor's court, “Where the vain trappings of a monarch's port “Would over my enquiries cast a veil, “And make my meditated purpose fail, “My fancy, with th' enticing subject warm'd, “A project wild, perhaps romantic, form'd. “If the young peasant, thought I, would exchange “His past'ral cares for knighthood's freer range, “Why should not I reverse his fond desire, “And for a while assume his mean attire? “Then, ev'ry vestige of the monarch flown, “My person and my views alike unknown, “I may that vaunted excellence behold, “And judge how far report hath truly told. “In such reflections pass'd the tedious night. “Soon as the dawn's first blush refresh'd my sight, “I ask'd my host, if for a peasant's suit “He would my splendid helm and arms commute. “With readiness he granted my request: “And now, as Polidore, in russet dress'd, “Forth from the cot with beating heart I went, “And tow'rds Prothenor's court my travel bent. “Fresh was the morn, and through the spreading wood “From the resplendent east a brilliant flood “Darting, awoke from ev'ry bush and spray, “The tuneful choir to chant their am'rous lay. “As tow'rds a green o'ershadow'd glade I drew, “A knight in burnish'd armour met my view. “Advancing, with a stern and haughty air, “Roughly he ask'd what cause had brought me there. “I started at this salutation rude, “But my resentment speedily subdued, “And, as my character assum'd became, “With def'rence told my humble state and name; “That, trusting to my merits for support, “I sought preferment at Prothenor's court. “‘Whate'er may be thy merits,’ he rejoin'd, “‘At court thou'd best some surer patron find. “‘Right may do much, but favour does yet more: “‘Desert unaided is too often poor; “‘And, while success the favour'd knave attends, “‘The honest man may starve for lack of friends. “‘Thou seem'st a youth of spirit, and, if chance “‘Occasion give, thy fortunes I'll advance. “‘The fortress where my state I hold is nigh: “‘If on a stranger's word thou canst rely, “‘Attend me there, and kindly welcome claim; “‘Assur'd of this, that thine will be the blame, “‘If to Mæonia's king thou dost not owe “‘Whate'er thou will'st, whate'er he can bestow.’ “This said, the knight his loud-ton'd bugle blew. “His escort at the summons tow'rds him flew; “At his command I vaulted on a steed, “And through the forest's paths we urg'd our speed. “Ere long its farther bound'ry we achiev'd, “When suddenly at distance I perceiv'd “A tow'ring fortress on a mountain high, “Whose turrets proudly seem'd to mock the sky. “Climbing the steep, its brow we gain'd at length, “Where its vast rampart, its embattled strength, “Its gates of proof on massive hinges hung, “The huge portcullis o'er its entrance flung, “The host of warriors which its circuit lin'd, “Shew'd it a place for strong defence design'd. “Tirynthe was the fortress call'd. Around “Its solid base a moat enormous wound, “While, trending far across th' adjacent plain, “Was seen the rich and dignified domain “Of Damocles its lord, Hyperia's son, “Nephew of him who fill'd Mæonia's throne. “Of him I now became the favour'd guest. “Oft-times to me his converse he address'd, “Discours'd of youths, who from a mean estate “Had made themselves by manly daring great, “Of shepherds, who their crooks had cast away, “And by their prowess gain'd imperial sway. “Thus, for a while, to distant hints confin'd, “He seem'd with cautious touch to probe my mind; “Deeming at length he need no longer cloak “His secret views, he thus more boldly spoke, “‘When first I saw thee, thy ingenuous look “‘And native frankness my attention took. “‘I would believe thou'rt honest and sincere, “‘And that a secret trusted to thine ear “‘Would in thy keeping as securely rest, “‘As if it still resided in my breast. “‘But tell me, ere such secret I impart, “‘Tell me, is fear a stranger to thy heart? “‘Hast thou a hand, which will its succour lend, “‘When wanted to support a gen'rous friend?’ “‘I trust,’ replied I, ‘that my honest heart “Will ne'er, when friendship calls, at danger start; “‘Nor will my hand devoid of vigour prove, “‘When rais'd in the defence of those I love.’ “‘Enough! I will believe thee,’ he replied. “‘Now listen, while my secret I confide. “‘The loss of Artabanes, only son “‘Of him whose brow sustains Mæonia's crown, “‘Hath of the kingdom made me lawful heir. “‘At his decease the sceptre I should bear, “‘Had not my doting uncle, in despite “‘Of ancient usage and a nephew's right, “‘As his successor Chariclea nam'd. “‘Nor hath that haughty fair one less proclaim'd “‘Her mock'ry of my title. With a pride “‘Which even courtly manners cannot hide “‘She treats me, and with supercilious scorn, “‘As if I were not of high lineage born, “‘As if the blood, which fills my ev'ry vein, “‘Were more impure than that her own contain. “‘I lov'd her once; and to prevent the woe “‘Which from a struggle for a crown must flow, “‘I proffer'd to partake with her the throne, “‘Which at her father's death should be mine own. “‘Spurning my suit, she chang'd my love to hate, “‘And drove me to decide Mæonia's fate. “‘On one great cast its future fortunes stand; “‘When thrown, its sceptre will adorn my hand. “‘If by thine aid an empire I shall gain, “‘If haughty Chariclea I obtain, “‘Exhaustless wealth, pre-eminence and pow'r “‘My boundless gratitude on thee shall show'r. “‘In their lone garden, at each ev'ning's close, “‘Prothenor and his daughters seek repose. “‘Behold this key, its private door which opes, “‘The blissful passport to my tow'ring hopes. “‘By this admittance gain; in ambush lie, “‘Till my devoted victim passes nigh; “‘Then, rushing forth, his heedless steps arrest, “‘Plant with sure aim this dagger in his breast, “‘While I secure my meditated prey, “‘And Chariclea to these walls convey.’ “‘Dar'st thou,’ I sternly cried, ‘my aid require, “‘When hopes like these thy trait'rous breast inspire?’ “‘Presumptuous slave!’ replied he, ‘dost presume “‘To question me, the master of thy doom?’ “With that his bugle to his lips applied, “Soon call'd his trusty followers to his side: “‘To the black tow'r,’ cried he, ‘this slave convey! “‘Secure him, or your lives the forfeit pay.’ “Resistance prov'd but vain; their felon hands, “Not slow to execute his stern commands, “Convey'd me up a long and steep ascent, “Where a dim light some narrow fissures lent, “Till, at the summit of the tow'r arriv'd, “A massive door, of iron plates contriv'd, “Op'ning, disclos'd a chamber dark and drear, “Th' abode of anguish and appalling fear. “No hearth was there, to mollify the blast “Of keenly-nipping winter as it pass'd, “No window introduc'd the sun's bright ray “To cheer the wretch who there desponding lay: “All was with iron bound, the wall, the floor, “The spreading cieling, and the pond'rous door, “Save at the centre of the vaulted roof, “Where was a grating small, with bars of proof “Strongly surmounted, to admit fresh air, “And throw a feeble glimm'ring o'er despair. “As with the steps of the retiring crew “Echoed the dungeon's walls, myself I threw “With desperation frantic on the ground. “Sudden, I started up, and gaz'd around, “As a soul-harrowing thought glanc'd o'er my mind. “‘Wretch that I was, and to the future blind! “‘While here,’ I cried, ‘a captive I remain, “‘Conspiracy its object may attain; “‘Securely now against his sovereign's life “‘May Damocles direct his murd'rous knife, “‘And Chariclea, heav'nly pow'rs! may prove “‘The victim of his sacrilegious love!’ “Such were the scenes which tort'ring fancy drew, “When on a mould'ring bench I fix'd my view. “I caught, I rais'd it up. It reach'd the roof! “By its support I lightly climb'd aloof. “Beneath my grasp, like twigs before the blast, “The bars gave way, and through the grate I pass'd. “For a brief moment from the summit rude “The depth stupendous as my eye pursued, “I shudder'd and drew back; my giddy brain “The sight terrific scarcely could sustain. “Again I gaz'd irresolute; to dare “Appear'd destruction, to remain despair. “But ended soon the impotent debate, “When Chariclea's and Prothenor's fate “Rush'd on my soul. To the dread verge I flew, “And o'er the battlements myself I threw. “Firmly their rugged pinnacle I caught, “While some supporter for my feet I sought; “Then by the stones which from the crumbling wall “Projecting stood, as if to save my fall, “I cautiously descended, while each blast, “Which o'er the frowning turret roughly pass'd, “Sounded as if death's summons it convey'd. “But nought my persevering ardour stay'd, “Till bless'd success my strenuous efforts crown'd, “And breathless with delight I reach'd the ground. “Instant I plung'd into the spreading moat; “Its stagnant waters lustily I smote: “Gaining its bank, across the champaign wide “Tow'rds a deep wood with rapid course I hied. “This traversing, the city I attain'd, “And soon an audience from Prothenor gain'd. “When my first duties to his rank were paid, “Of what had pass'd I full disclosure made. “The King amaz'd, as I pursued my task, “Would interrupt me oft, and questions ask; “But, soon as ascertain'd to what extent “The projects of his trait'rous kinsman went, “His gen'rous heart with gratitude o'erflow'd; “And, over-rating what to me he ow'd, “He bad me tell how best his royal sway “The service I had render'd might repay. “‘If my bold thought,’ I said, ‘might soar so high, “‘Would the fair Princess with my suit comply, “‘To tend upon her as her faithful guard “‘Would crown my hopes, and prove my best reward.’ “To my bold suit the monarch gave assent, “And to salute the fair we instant went. “How can I paint my transport, my surprise, “When Chariclea's beauties met mine eyes? “All that bold fancy in her wildest flight “Had imag'd of perfection and delight, “All that to promise flatt'ring hope had dar'd, “Sank into shade when with her charms compar'd. “Youth crown'd with blooming health adorn'd her face, “Her form th' assemblage seem'd of ev'ry grace, “Love fix'd his throne in her expressive eye, “And ev'ry gesture teem'd with dignity. “She smil'd—she spoke—her accents far more sweet “Than those which from his solitary seat, “At ev'ning's close his paramour to cheer, “The nightingale pours forth, entranc'd mine ear; “She granted all for which my hope could sue, “And bade me prove to her as to her father true. “Soon widely spread rebellion's fatal cry, “And civil discord shook her torch on high: “Stern Damocles his sov'reign's vengeance brav'd; “His standard on Tirynthe's ramparts wav'd. “Confiding in his prowess, and aware “That few in single field his pow'r would dare, “Commission'd to deliver his intent “A herald to Prothenor's court he sent, “Who thus his mandate spoke—‘Tho' just his cause, “‘Humanity compels my master's pause, “‘Ere war and its attendant horrors reign, “‘And civic slaughter fair Mæonia stain. “‘Between Prothenor and himself alone “‘The contest rests, the glorious prize a throne. “‘He therefore calls on him in equal fight “‘To terminate this litigated right; “‘Or, if this gallant proffer he refuse, “‘Let him through Asia's bound a champion choose, “‘If any be, who confidently dare “‘Compete with Damocles in combat fair. “‘Three days he grants him to decide: in these “‘On either side hostilities shall cease.’ “‘Herald,’ replied the King, ‘this answer make: “‘Thy master's proffer of a truce I take; “‘And, for my faithful subjects' sake, agree “‘T'accept the terms he tenders me by thee.’ “Soon as the herald from his presence went, “For his most favour'd peers the monarch sent. “‘Chieftains,’ said he, ‘supporters of my throne, “‘Now be your loyalty and prowess shewn. “‘To meet his hardihood in equal fight, “‘The rebel Damocles expects some knight. “‘My arm, though nervous once, by age effete, “‘Cannot his youthful vigour safely meet. “‘Say, which of you this vaunter will chastise, “‘And win Tirynthe as his glorious prize?’ “He ceas'd, and vainly waited a reply: “In prowess none with Damocles dar'd vie. “Two ling'ring days elaps'd, and now the sun “His third bright course thro' heav'n had nearly run; “Still had no knight the rebel chief defied, “Prothenor still in secret anguish sigh'd, “When as, alone, upon the morrow's fate, “Doubtful as yet, he ruminating sat, “A stranger champion at his gate appear'd. “Soon as the King of his arrival heard, “He pray'd him to approach, as one from whom “He hop'd deliv'rance from his menac'd doom. “The knight complied. A helm and arms he wore “Of simplest fashion, and a shield he bore “On which a sun arising was reveal'd, “Its splendid orb by passing clouds conceal'd, “Whence blaz'd these words in characters of flame, “‘Though for a while obscur'd, I'm still the same.’ “‘I come,’ said he, ‘a stranger and unknown, “‘T'assert thy cause and vindicate thy throne. “‘Grant me free licence in thy royal sight “‘To face thy rebel foe, and prove thy right.’ “‘Thy boon, brave Sir, is granted,’ he replied; “‘In cause so just may heav'n thine efforts guide! “‘Yet, when my gallant champion thus I thank, “‘Declare, I pray, thy title and thy rank.’ “‘Behold this emblem on my shield,’ he cried; “‘Awhile must I my name and station hide. “‘Meantime, with thy permission, I retire: “‘To-morrow's toils some previous rest require.’ “Now from heav'n's height declin'd night's ebon car, “And in the mottled east day's brilliant star, “Herald of dawn, proclaim'd the morning nigh. “Darting his vivid splendors o'er the sky, “Soon rose the full-orb'd sun, and from the deep “His chariot urg'd tow'rds the meridian steep; “Not, as the champion's modest emblem shew'd, “Obscur'd from view by many a passing cloud, “But thro' the bright expanse resplendently he rode. “With clangor shrill the brazen trumpets peal'd, “And call'd the ready champions to the field, “Where round the ample lists, in arms array'd, “A neutral band their ensigns gay display'd. “Above the throng'd assemblage, on a throne “Which bright with gold and sparkling jewels shone, “Mæonia's king assum'd his rightful place; “On either hand of whom a sister grace, “Here Chariclea, there Hermilia fair, “Sat in becoming state, a matchless pair. “In anxious expectation stood the crowd, “When the shrill clarion's intonation loud “Gave notice that the challenger drew nigh. “With air disdainful, and demeanor high, “Through the wide portal rapidly he rode. “A vig'rous sable courser he bestrode; “The splendid helmet which adorn'd his head “A plume of Tyrian purple overspread. “When near the throne, his foaming steed he rein'd, “And with a look, as if he hardly deign'd “The King to notice, proudly rais'd his crest, “And Chariclea thus aloud address'd. “‘Since of our Asian knights none can withstand “‘The matchless force of my experienc'd hand, “‘I count, fair lady, ere this day be flown, “‘The charms I now behold to call mine own. “‘Meantime with gracious condescension prove “‘That valour's meed is not disdain'd by love.’ “He said. The Princess, with averted eye “Displeasure marking, made him no reply. “He paus'd—‘'Tis well,’ he cried, ‘perhaps an hour “‘Will bring that haughty beauty in my pow'r. “‘Now for the proof!’ with that he spurr'd his steed, “And rush'd across the field with furious speed. “Again loud clarions made the welkin ring, “And call'd the champion of Mæonia's king. “Forward he rode; in plainest armour drest, “No gaudy plumage deck'd his modest crest. “Advancing to the throne, his rev'rence made, “To peerless Chariclea thus he said. “‘Illustrious lady, ere my foe I face, “‘With one celestial smile thy servant grace. “‘Thrice blest is he, who from thy favour draws “‘His confidence to vindicate thy cause.’ “‘May heav'n's just pow'rs,’ with fervour she replied, “‘Thine arm, brave knight, to glorious conquest guide. “‘This small remembrance of my favour wear, “‘And nobly triumph as you nobly dare.’ “‘With that, while blushes her fair face suffus'd, “A ribband from her ringlets she unloos'd: “‘This pledge,’ said she, ‘of my approval take, “‘And wear it, gallant stranger, for my sake.’ “The knight, whose every limb with rapture shook, “From her fair hand the precious token took, “And plac'd it on his helm; then, bowing low, “He turn'd in haste to meet his threat'ning foe. “As when at summer's eve the low'ring sky, “Black and obscure, portends a tempest nigh, “If two dense clouds, with sulph'rous vapours swell'd, “By adverse winds from diff'rent points impell'd, “Meet in mid air, straight with terrific clash “Hoarse thunders burst, quick-glancing lightnings flash; “Such was the conflict, when, by vengeance stirr'd, “Th' opposing knights their vig'rous coursers spurr'd. “Long hand to hand, in well-contested strife, “They fought for honour, victory, and life, “When, on his foeman's crest, with rage renew'd “The badge which grac'd it the Tirynthian view'd. “‘Too long,’ cried he, ‘that trophy hast thou worn, “‘But shortly shall it from thy helm be torn!’ “‘That trophy,’ said the stranger, ‘bears a charm “‘To guard its wearer from thy pow'rful arm. “‘In Chariclea's name I dare thee, knight! “‘Her fearless champion bids thee prove thy might.’ “The bold Tirynthian no such taunt requir'd, “By wounded pride and vengeance new inspir'd, “More furiously he rush'd upon his foe. “Nor to receive him was the stranger slow; “His menac'd blow he caught upon his shield, “And struck the vanquish'd rebel to the field. “While there convuls'd in death the traitor lay, “And fled his soul in crimson'd streams away, “The stranger knight to Chariclea bow'd; “Then, as applauses burst throughout the crowd, “Spurring his gallant steed the barrier clear'd, “And 'cross the champaign swiftly disappear'd. “The king, astounded at a feat so strange, “Bad his attendants through the country range, “And urge him to return. In vain they sought, “No tidings of the fugitive they brought.” Still spoke the king, when from his princely dame To crave short audience time-blanch'd Theron came. As he approach'd and salutation made, Starting, with fix'd attention he survey'd The royal pair. “Ye doubtless must have heard “Th' events,” said he, “which recently occurr'd. “Though base Cresphontes fell, my lady fair “Knows not what felons in his treasons share: “She therefore asks you, if, in knighthood's name, “She may your guidance and protection claim.” “So slight a service,” Caria's prince replied, “By no true knight could ever be denied. “Your noble mistress instantly assure “That our joint arms her travel shall secure.” “On her behalf who for your escort sues “Take my best thanks,” he answer'd, “nor refuse, “Since fit occasion suits, in her retreat “The noble dame whom ye protect to greet.” Full readily the princes gave assent. Through the wide courts and lofty halls they went, Debating who might prove the unknown fair Thus suddenly entrusted to their care. When op'd the portal, and the dame they saw, They stopt, they gaz'd, impress'd with sudden awe. Not fam'd Apelles, when he ransack'd Greece For sep'rate charms to make one perfect piece, In all th' assemblage could such beauties find, As in this single wonder were combin'd: Not all the loveliness and winning grace, Which the rapt poet's phrenzied eye can trace In the lov'd object of his am'rous care, Could with this matchless paragon compare. “Pardon,” cried Orosmanes, “if, when first “Charms so unlook'd for on our senses burst, “We fail'd to speak, what most our bosoms feel, “Our faithful service and unbounded zeal.” “That Mysia's king his courtesy should prove, “Cannot,” replied the fair, “my wonder move: “But whence can it arise, that Caria's prince “Should no kind symptom of regard evince? “A sister may a brother's notice claim— “Must I to him repeat Zapheria's name?” As thus she spoke, Alcimedon amaz'd For a brief moment on her features gaz'd; “My lov'd Zapheria!” cried he, “now I trace “That native sweetness and alluring grace, “Which erst endear'd thee to my heart, ere time “Had made thine infant beauties thus sublime. “Now, since kind heav'n restores thee to my sight, “I claim, in this embrace, a brother's right.” “Of former scenes,” the Mysian king exclaim'd, “Let not my strange forgetfulness be blam'd. “Well pleas'd I now recal those days serene, “When thy lov'd presence grac'd our blissful scene; “But then not fancy's self could have pourtray'd “The change which since propitious time hath made. “The wire-drawn crescent faintly marks the line, “Which in the full-orb'd moon we well define: “What charms soe'er the op'ning bud disclose, “Scarce leave a vestige in the perfect rose. “But, since to grant this meeting fate hath deign'd, “Let not your converse be by me restrain'd: “Much hath my friend to hear, and much to tell, “Of what since he Miletus left befel. “Restrain not then your speech. Meantime, apart “I would remain, and commune with my heart.” He said, and left them. As in pensive mood And lost in thought he in an oriel stood, Theron approach'd, and the sad king address'd. “When fortune thus thy happier friend hath bless'd, “Is there no dear and oft-regretted name, “To move thy heart and recollection claim?” “Too sure such tender scenes,” replied the king, “To my remembrance joys once cherish'd bring, “Like my still favour'd friend, I once could prove “The soft endearments of a sister's love, “Once with my Aracynthus I could share “My bosom's transport or its secret care.” “Of him,” said Theron, “if thou aught wouldst know, “I haply can relate. But wilt thou vow “No ear but thine the secret tale shall hear?” “By heav'n's blest saints,” replied the king, “I swear!” “Then,” answer'd Theron, “at the midnight hour, “In the lone gallery of the eastern tow'r “Meet me. Farewell!” He hastily retir'd, And left the king with wild impatience fir'd. While from the rest apart they thus convers'd, To his fair sister Caria's prince rehears'd All that capricious fate had made him prove, His frequent dangers and mysterious love; Till as he spoke of the Icarian tow'r, How from the Saracenic pirates' pow'r Perinthus rescued him, her looks express'd The painful sentiment which mov'd her breast. “Alas!” she cried, “thy strong encomiums shew “Thou canst but little of Perinthus know; “Of that Perinthus whose fair form and face “The model shew'd of elegance and grace, “Whose eye with virtue's loveliest semblance beam'd, “Whom youth approving lov'd and age esteem'd. “At once the pride and horror of our age, “He 'scap'd the devastating tempest's rage, “As if by adverse destiny decreed “To perpetrate a foul and monstrous deed, “A deed—But first I claim thy promise giv'n “To leave its chastisement to righteous heav'n.” “That promise,” said the prince, “I freely give. “In knighthood's rank could I with honour live, “Were I to deem that gallant youth my foe, “To whom such boundless gratitude I owe?” “Now may I safely,” answer'd she, “disclose “Whence this foul stain to chivalry arose. “Scarce had'st thou left us, when the wretch deprav'd, “From whom thy timely aid Aspasia sav'd, “The Dragon Knight, his base attempts renew'd; “But with such privacy his plans pursu'd “That none could learn the bold intruder's name, “Where he remain'd conceal'd, or whence he came. “At length he seem'd his purpose to give o'er; “The invader of our peace appear'd no more. “Aspasia now, from apprehension free, “Again enjoy'd her 'custom'd liberty, “When lo! Perinthus to Miletus came. “To high distinction all confess'd his claim, “One sex his valour and address approv'd, “The other own'd his winning grace—and lov'd! “Our gen'rous sire receiv'd him as his guest, “Admir'd his talents and his worth confess'd, “When, so it chanc'd, in the far spreading glade “Which skirts the palace as Aspasia stray'd, “A well-arm'd ruffian 'mid her virgin train “Seiz'd and with swiftness bore her o'er the plain. “Her shrieking damsels call'd aloud for aid, “When, as heav'n will'd, my father, who there made “Uncustom'd visit, heard their shrill lament. “To rescue his insulted child intent, “Heading his guards the ruffian he pursued. “His near approach when the base spoiler view'd, “His prey relinquishing he turn'd aside, “As if within the forest he would hide. “The strenuous guards meantime had nearly gain'd “The covert which the fugitive contain'd, “When from its entrance rush'd the Dragon Knight! “Instant the guards fell back in wild affright; “When brave Chrysulphus, soon as he beheld “The formidable foe, his steed impell'd, “And aiming at his helm a furious stroke, “With well directed blow the vizor broke. “Vain, vain are words to picture his surprise— “Perinthus' features met his wond'ring eyes! “Our sire, with double vengeance now inflam'd, “A second blow at the false traitor aim'd: “With practis'd skill he caught it on his shield, “And instant struck Chrysulphus to the field, “Then with a speed that all pursuit defied, “His course he bent along the champaign wide.” All further speech her sighs and tears suppress'd, When thus Alcimedon the maid address'd. “Though 'gainst my friend such evidence be strong, “Too sudden credence would a hero wrong, “Whose noble nature and chivalric grace “Falsehood can't stain, or treason foul debase. “No, my Zapheria! Doubt the glorious sun “Through the wide zodiac can his progress run, “Doubt the fraternal love my heart which warms, “Thine own perfections and resistless charms, “Doubt all that's certain, soon as doubt the truth, “Th' untainted honour of that gen'rous youth! “But now far diff'rent cares my thoughts require. “I almost dread to ask—How fares our sire?” “He lives,” she cried, “again to health restor'd, “Honour'd by all, and by his realm ador'd. “With our belov'd Aspasia, some days since, “He went to visit the Mæonian prince; “I follow'd them. What since hath pass'd ye know, “And what to faithful Theron's zeal I owe.” “Against the ruffians who thy chamber sought “Right valiantly,” said Mysia's king, “he fought. “Yet strange it seems, that one so white with age “In combat should so vig'rously engage.” “I marvel not,” the Carian fair rejoin'd, “Thou should'st surprising his achievement find. “Yet would'st thou wonder more, could'st thou but hear “His sage discourses and his reas'nings clear. “'Tis as if nature had to him reveal'd “The myst'ries which from others she conceal'd: “He seems to trace her to her secret springs, “And from her source abstruse conviction brings. “But pardon me—My strength, by toil opprest, “Warns me to seek betimes some needful rest; “For, soon as morrow's dawn brings on the day, “We to Larissa must pursue our way.” “Since to Mæonia' court thy course is bent, “I must,” said Mysia's king, “my fate lament: “A cause there is, of import grave and high, “Which from that spot forbidden makes me fly. “Spare me to tell it—needs must it be strong, “When thus it makes me knighthood's precepts wrong. “Farewell—A brother's arm may well suffice “To guard his lovely sister from surprise.” With that the princes courteously arose, And, leaving fair Zapheria to repose, To their apartment speedily return'd. “Though of thy fortunes I a portion learn'd,” Said Caria's prince, “Whence sprang thy present woe, “Since fit occasion suits, I pray thee shew.” “Grant me attention,” answer'd he, “when thus “The sequel of my story I discuss.” CANTO IV. “When fell the rebel Damocles, again “Peace and security resum'd their reign. “My moments now with rapid progress flew; “Each day my prospects more alluring grew: “For patroniz'd by Chariclea's grace, “I could at leisure her perfections trace, “That taste correct, that elegance of mind, “By which all other beauties are refin'd, “That chaste reserve which excellence most decks, “And crowns the best endowments of the sex. “She knew me not as him, whose pow'rful sway “Mysia's wide realm and subject isles obey; “No—As myself she knew me, unadorn'd “By rank or title, nor my service scorn'd. “Uncheck'd I gaz'd upon her lovely face, “Caught ev'ry moment some new winning grace, “Bask'd in her fav'ring smiles—Oh transport vast! “Oh happiness too exquisite to last! “Gone like the meteor, which through heav'n's expanse “Shoots its bright ray with momentary glance! “For now, as if my ruin fate contriv'd, “Achæmenes, Cresphontes' son, arriv'd. “Nephew of rebel Damocles, whose fate “Stirr'd in his moody soul revengeful hate, “And proud of his connection with the throne, “Which, like his kinsman, now he deem'd his own; “As pledge to fortify his haughty claim, “To Chariclea's hand he rais'd his aim. “One day, as mid her garden's sweets she walk'd, “And playfully with her attendants talk'd, “Achæmenes arriv'd. With forward air “And phrase familiar he address'd the fair, “Bluntly demanding token of regard, “Which might the homage he avow'd reward. “She, with a countenance that plainly prov'd “The high disdain with which her soul was mov'd, “To her attendants turn'd—‘Those flow'rets sweet “‘Might form a chaplet for the season meet; “‘Your elegance and tasteful skill display, “‘And weave in wreaths combin'd their colours gay.’ “All in obedience to her pleasure vied, “E'en proud Achæmenes himself complied. “Soon as our sportive enterprise was done, “Each with a garland to the princess run; “But ere we could present them, with an air “Of one who ill could competition bear, “Achæmenes before the rest advanc'd, “And, on the princess as a look he glanc'd “Which spoke high confidence, ‘This garland take,’ “He cried, ‘and wear it, fairest, for my sake. “‘The noblest dame may well the gift receive “‘From hands like mine, such toys which seldom weave.’ “‘Embellishments so gaudy,’ said the fair, “‘So void of fancy, those who prize may wear. “‘Give me thy chaplet, Polydore; thy taste “‘Already often has my tresses grac'd. “‘That simple wreath, where blends the half blown rose “‘With jasmine, shall my ornament compose.’ “Casting his eyes which flash'd with anger round, “He dash'd the slighted garland to the ground. “‘Immortal pow'rs!’ he cried, ‘and do I see “‘A slave like Polydore preferr'd to me! “‘A lowly servitor, a thing of nought, “‘One who my kinsman's fall by treach'ry wrought—’ “‘Cease!’ I exclaim'd, unable to restrain “My fury, ‘cease, calumniator vain! “‘Hence from my sight, ere Orosmanes' blade “‘Send thee to join thy rebel kinsman's shade!’ “As when heaven's bolt strikes some aspiring tow'r, “And falls the mass in one o'erwhelming show'r, “Th' affrighted traveller aghast surveys “The ruin, and his trembling footstep stays, “So, when I spoke that unexpected name, “All speechless with astonishment became. “But soon the princess with majestic air “Achæmenes address'd—‘Rude Sir, forbear! “‘Nor station nor relationship permit “‘License thus strange. Away! my presence quit. “‘Thou, Polydore, remain.’—With vengeance fir'd “The sullen chief indignantly retir'd. “She motion'd her attendants to be gone, “Who straight obey'd, and we remain'd alone. “Her air seem'd troubled, but my anxious eye “Could not displeasure in her look descry. “Silent awhile she stood: as a faint blush “Flitted across her cheek with sudden flush, “At length she said, ‘Since Polydore I knew, “‘I've found him ever to my service true. “‘If he would still my confidence deserve, “‘Ah! let him not from honour's dictates swerve. “‘Tell me, nor think thy honest warmth I blame, “‘What made thee utter Orosmanes' name?’ “‘Though,’ I replied, ‘on what I now relate “‘Rests the decision of my future fate, “‘I will obey thee, and reveal the whole “‘Which long hath occupied my ardent soul. “‘Supremely by thy gracious favour blest, “‘If I have nourish'd in my constant breast “‘A thought presumptuous, or a daring hope “‘Beyond the purest passion's tender scope, “‘May heav'nly justice my offence requite, “‘And banish me for ever from thy sight. “‘Yes, matchless Chariclea! at thy feet “‘Falling thus prostrate I thy censure meet. “‘Let Mysia's king, let Orosmanes own “‘He loves, adores and lives for thee alone!’ “As thus I spoke, encrimson'd blushes dy'd “Her cheek, her bosom—Fault'ring she replied, “‘Rise, royal Sir—nay, spare me, I implore— “‘I cannot answer—may not hear thee more— “‘Some other time perhaps’—‘Oh! why not now,’ “I cried, ‘thy Orosmanes' suit allow? “‘Since of thy charms the vassal I became, “‘Pure was my love, and holy was my flame, “‘Pure as thy peerless self!

In fix'd surprise “Gazing, she cried, ‘Can I believe mine eyes? “‘I gave that ribband to the stranger knight “‘Who vanquish'd Damocles in single fight, “‘Who sav'd my sire, and champion'd my fair fame. “‘Can he and Orosmanes be the same?’ “‘In all, save this,’ I said, ‘the stranger knight, “‘Honour'd by thee—I, banish'd from thy sight: “‘Proudly the trophy which thou gav'st he wore; “‘As Orosmanes I the gift restore.’ “‘Stay yet, oh stay!’ the blushing maid replied; “‘Why thus so long th' important service hide? “‘Believe me, royal Sir, my grateful heart “‘Feels that which words but feebly can impart.’ “‘Talk not to me of gratitude,’ I said, “‘My service by itself was amply paid. “‘But if my hopes aspiring may presume “‘Without offence to advocate my doom, “‘Bid me not leave thee, let me at thy feet “‘Still as thine humblest slave my sentence meet; “‘Still, as thy Polydore, ah let me prove “‘How fervently, how faithfully I love!’ “‘Once more I pray thee spare me,’ she replied; “‘Urge me no more—I cannot now decide— “‘No longer now thy name, thy rank conceal; “‘Thy royal station to my sire reveal; “‘Gladly will he Mæonia's champion greet, “‘And in his presence when again we meet—’ “More had she said, while mantling blushes dy'd “Her half-averted face, but fate denied; “For one arriv'd, commissioned to require “Her prompt attendance on her royal sire. “She sigh'd as thus he spoke, yet gave assent, “And tow'rds the palace turn'd; but, as she went, “A smile, which made my heart with rapture swell, “She gave, and whisper'd, ‘Polydore, farewell!’ “Ecstatic sounds! For one bright gilded hour “Then felt I joy's intoxicating pow'r; “My melting soul dissolv'd in blissful trance, “All heav'n expanded to my raptur'd glance, “My heart with transports more than mortal swell'd, “When lo! once more my charmer I beheld. “Kneeling before her I exclaim'd, ‘Again “‘Hear my fond suit, nor my request disdain. “‘When will thy virgin purity allow “‘Thy Polydore to breathe his hallow'd vow?’ “‘Never!’ replied she, ‘Never may mine ear “‘Again the voice of Orosmanes hear.’ “‘Never!’ I wildly cried, ‘For what offence “‘Thy Orosmanes would'st thou banish hence!’ “To the deaf winds I spoke—Th' unpitying fair ‘Fled from my sight, and left me to despair. “Alas! What then thy wretched friend befel “Nor fancy can pourtray nor language tell. “Who can describe the storm-vex'd ocean's course, “The tempest's wide-exterminating force, “Or paint the fatal ravages of fire, “When a whole blazing forest forms the pyre? “In my torn bosom rag'd a fiercer flame; “Nature's wild tumults to my pangs were tame; “Till 'neath their hideous influence reason sank, “And all creation was to me a blank. “When, for some purposes unknown ordain'd, “My sense and recollection I regain'd, “As if calamity my heart had stunn'd, “I fled mankind, and social commerce shunn'd: “In yon lone wood, far from the haunts of men, “Twelve months, in dark and solitary den, “Pass'd I my tristful hours: to me the sight “Of the resplendent sun brought no delight, “On me the moon and all her starry train “Their more attemper'd radiance cast in vain: “The varying seasons pass'd unheeded by; “The face of nature to my jaundic'd eye “Shew'd a disconsolate and dreary void; “On one sad contemplation still employ'd, “No other thought could my attention share; “So deep my grief, so fix'd my black despair. “At length my fate more calmly I survey'd. “If to propitiate the obdurate maid “Were still by heav'n allow'd, my longer stay “Would only the transporting bliss delay; “If still relentless she should prove, my soul “Might gain remission from her stern controul. “By hope and fear thus torn, with eager haste “Th' impression on my buckler I effac'd, “Resolv'd that, till my fate should milder grow, “Me as its once-fam'd bearer none should know. “Arm'd at all points, and vaulting on my steed, “To the Larissan court I urg'd his speed. “In phrase the most respectful I essay'd “To move the justice of the royal maid; “I told my suff'rings, call'd on heav'n above “To vouch my tender, my eternal love, “And her permission humbly sought once more “To claim her pity and her grace implore. “The scroll I sent; her answer quickly came— “By Heav'n! my madd'ning soul is in a flame “When I reflect—Oh! may'st thou never know “The tort'ring pangs, th' inexplicable woe, “Which like a torrent overwhelm'd my soul, “When I unopen'd saw again my scroll, “Which from her cruel hand this sentence bore— “‘Never, oh prince, these eyes may see thee more. “‘This further proof of my resolve receive, “‘And, if my wish avail, Larissa leave.’— “Yes too obdurate maid!

In all thy cruelty exult, “Mock at my pangs, my constancy insult, “To enhance my woes exert thine ev'ry art, “Probe to its inmost core my tortur'd heart! “That heart may break—But, while its pulses beat, “There my immortal love shall hold its seat; “And when, releas'd from sublunary ties, “My soul to regions yet unknown shall rise, “E'en in the trance and agony of death, “Thy still dear name shall linger on my breath, “With ev'ry pray'r for sacred mercy blend, “And with my spirit to high heav'n ascend.— “Forgive, forgive me, friend! My weakness needs “The sympathy from friendship which proceeds. “Methinks, already thy consoling sigh, “The pitying tear which trembles in thine eye, “Calm to repose my agitated soul: “As if some opiate o'er my senses stole, “The tempest of my heart subsides, again “Reason asserts her interrupted reign. “Let me then cherish her reviving beam, “And quit, while yet I can, my painful theme: “A few brief words, and those succinctly told, “The sequel of my fortunes will unfold. “With burning brain and agonizing breast, “I paid obedience to the stern behest: “My soul with wonder, as with passion, fraught, “The town I quitted, and the forest sought. “To thee I need not what ensued repeat, “The story of my suff'rings is complete.” With intonation loud, and echoing swell, Now from its turret toll'd the castle bell, Announcing midnight, that appointed hour, When in the gall'ry of the eastern tow'r Mysteriously the Mysian king should meet Time-stricken Theron. Starting from his seat, “Forgive me, friend,” he cried; “a secret cause “For some short moments my attention draws. “I must away—Abide not my return. “Behold, our lamps already dimly burn, “And warn thee to retire. Thou may'st not share “What now engrosses Orosmanes' care.” Thus saying, he the chamber left. In haste The spacious courts and gloomy halls he trac'd, Through which the waning moon's uncertain ray Gave feeble aid to light him on his way. To the lone gall'ry when at length he came, A single lamp with vacillating flame Disclos'd the vet'ran, who with footsteps slow And interrupted oft pac'd to and fro, His thoughtful eyes now fix'd upon the ground, Now cast in anxious expectation round. Soon as the king he saw, “Approach,” he said, “Securely now beneath night's friendly shade “A secret, to all others yet unknown. “I would communicate to thee alone. “List, while of Aracynthus' fate I tell, “The varied fortunes which that prince befel, “When on discov'ry of thy course intent, “From Mysia's court he unattended went— “But hark! What steps are those?—I am betray'd!— “Adieu! My confidence must be delay'd. “Mark me, however—With the dawn of day “If to Chelidia thou wilt take thy way, “I'll meet thee shortly and my secret tell. “No longer can I tarry now.—Farewell!” He said, and straight extinguishing the light Through the dark passages he took his flight. Nor groundless prov'd the hoary Theron's fear. Soon Mysia's king distinguish'd footsteps near, And by the pale moon's quiv'ring beam, which play'd Through the dim blazon'd casements, he survey'd The Carian prince. “Ah! wherefore,” he exclaim'd, “Against my peace hath even friendship aim'd? “Had'st thou but stay'd, and the kind impulse check'd “Which made thee thus my strong request neglect, “All that to Aracynthus has occurr'd, “All I most long to know I should have heard.” “If,” said the prince, “affection's erring aim “Hath wrought this wrong, to that impute the blame. “But how of Aracynthus learn, or how “In this seclusion of his fortunes know?” “My friend, thy kind forbearance I implore,” The king replied, “I may not tell thee more. “I to Chelidia must pursue my way, “And must depart before the dawn of day.” “Yet let not my intreaty be denied,” Exclaim'd the prince. “I must with thee abide: “Friendship like mine may minister relief. “I cannot, dare not trust thee to thy grief. “That task fulfill'd, that pious duty o'er, “To guard my sister I return once more.” The Mysian king according his assent, To court a short repose the princes went. Soon pass'd the night, and with returning day They tow'rds Chelidia took their purpos'd way. CANTO V. Now shot the ruddy sun his golden beam, The ploughman whistled to his patient team, On ev'ry plant and flow'r bright dew-drops hung, And pois'd in air the lark her matins sung, When from the castle fair Zapheria went, And slowly tow'rds the wood her progress bent, As through a glade with trees o'er-arch'd she walk'd, With Theron of its varied charms she talk'd, Who from each leaf and herb such inf'rence drew, (As if dark nature's hidden plans he knew,) That o'er her raptur'd and enlighten'd soul Of truths sublime conviction sweetly stole: In heav'nly contemplation lost she stood, And bless'd the glorious Origin of Good; While Theron, leaning on his staff, survey'd With fix'd observance the delighted maid, And her attendant damsels all around Cull'd each enamell'd flow'r that deck'd the ground. While thus their pleasing pastime they pursued, Approaching near two peasant swains they view'd, Who walk'd as if by travel overspent. He who seem'd weakest on his comrade leant, But leant in vain, for on a verdant bank Besprent with flow'rs of various hue he sank. As an imploring eye he sadly rais'd, With wonder on his face Zapheria gaz'd: Features so just, a tint so heav'nly fair, Such sweet expression, such a noble air, Seem'd to bespeak a rank more dignified Than that his rustic garniture implied. “Fair lady!” said he, “in thine eyes I read “Compassion for a hapless stranger's need. “Behold two brothers, who through wood and glade “For three long days without a guide have stray'd. “'Tis not an alms we crave; shew us, we pray, “To fair Larissa's walls our surest way.” “A stranger like yourselves,” Zapheria cried, “Can but uncertainly your footsteps guide. “But, though important be thy painful quest, “Let it awhile give way to needful rest: “And tell me, gentle swain, what urgent cause “Thy travel thus to fair Larissa draws.” “We trust that there,” the fault'ring swain rejoin'd, “The valiant Melixertes we may find.” “Alas!” Zapheria cried, “that gallant knight, “Made captive by the Saracens in fight, “Fell by their barb'rous hands.”—A sudden shriek Burst from the youth, and, ere she more could speak, Senseless he fell upon the sod. In vain To aid him crowded round the damsel train: Some with kind care his pallid visage fann'd, While others from his neck releas'd the band, And drawing forth the broach which clasp'd his vest, Blush'd as their hands disclos'd a woman's breast. “Poor, hapless mourner!” cried the Carian fair, “I know thee now. Too plainly this despair “Proclaims thee that Lycoris, whose sad fate “I heard Alcimedon with tears relate. “None but thyself such winning charms can boast, “Nor mourn thus deeply Melixertes lost. “And thou too, fair unknown, who well I know “Art other than thy peasant garments shew. “Say who ye are, and wherefore thus array'd “This long and painful pilgrimage ye made.” “At thy command,” the trembling stranger cried, “Our names and quality I will not hide. “She is Lycoris, whom thy damsels tend, “Her faithful servant I, and humble friend. “Pity, respect the cause, by which compell'd, “Her course from Chios she hath hither held, “Trusting to find in the Mæonian court “A safe asylum and assured support.” She said. As still Lycoris lay entranc'd, Zapheria's eye on watchful Theron glanc'd. Its silent language well he understood: Raising the fainting maiden, through the wood He to the castle bore her, where with those, Who with the Carian princess follow'd close, Respectfully he left her to repose. By their assiduous kindness soon the fair Again awoke to horror and despair. She rais'd her languid head; her phrenzied eye With glance unmeaning glar'd on vacancy, And oft she wrung her hands, and oft she sigh'd, And oft on death in broken accents cried. Till starting suddenly, with eager air, “'Tis he! 'tis he!” she cried, “I see him there— “Unclasp me—loose your hold—I come, I come! “One were our hearts, united be our doom! “Oh sacred shade of him whom I ador'd! “Oh Melixertes, my fond bosom's lord! “Com'st thou to claim thy once affianc'd bride? “I'll follow thee wherever thou may'st guide— “He comes—Support me heaven!”—“Be mine that care!” Exclaim'd Alcanor, as with raptur'd air Forward he rush'd, and caught the shrieking fair. How vain is fancy, poetry how faint, Transport like theirs so exquisite to paint! Nature denied them words; but far beyond All that sublimest eloquence e'er conn'd Was their expression mute: for what so well The fine affections of the heart can tell, As the rapt look, the gently heaving sigh, The tear that trickles from the melting eye, When, as abstracted from the world, the soul, Lost in Elysian bliss, without control Indulges in its momentary trance, And utters volumes in a single glance! But mortal senses could not long sustain Ecstatic joy, so near allied to pain. Soon sighs responsive from each bosom broke, They wept unconscious, they embrac'd, they spoke. When their first transports were at length allay'd, To Caria's princess thus the stranger said. “Lady, forgive if I could not control “The tumult of my agitated soul: “The call of duty let me now obey, “And at thy feet my bounden homage pay. “Already hath Alcanor's hand prevail'd “To check the foes thy safety who assail'd; “Now as myself, as Melixertes, deign “T'enroll me, lady, in thy vassal train. “Accept the services of him, who knows “What to thy kindness his Lycoris owes.” “I see, illustrious knight,” Zapheria cried, “True courtesy to valour is allied, “And joy to think that heav'n at last should prove “Propitious to thy constancy and love. “But say, for wond'rous it must sure appear, “How wast thou rescued, how conducted here? “Thy friend had wept thee number'd with the dead, “That friend my brother, who, to Chios led, “Assum'd of Thrasylus the borrow'd name, “And partner in thy adverse fate became.” “Was he thy brother, he my life who sav'd, “Who for my sake such dread encounters brav'd? “Such tie, fair princess, doubly binds me thine, “Confirms thy will my law, thy wishes mine. “Strangely indeed th' eventful fortunes wrought, “Which me, a wand'ring exile, hither brought: “Should fit occasion serve, my chequer'd fate “At thy command I freely will relate.” “What time can prove more fit?” the princess said. “Then let not thy recital be delay'd.” The knight reposing by Lycoris' side, With fair Zapheria's wishes thus complied. “Esteem'd of valiant Diocles the son, “My early years in one calm current run, “Nor did a pang my tranquil bosom rend, “Till death depriv'd me of that only friend. “Too well I recollect the fatal day, “When, as expiring on his couch he lay, “While with a feeble grasp my hand he press'd, “Me lost in filial grief he thus address'd. “‘Ere yet no more my languid pulses beat, “‘List while thine infant fortunes I repeat. “‘When war 'twixt Andros and Byzantium rag'd, “‘It chanc'd an Andrian vessel I engag'd. “‘Fierce was our conflict, and on either side “‘The crowded decks with crimson'd streams were dy'd, “‘When, all our force uniting, we assail'd “‘Her weaken'd crew, and finally prevail'd. “‘When thus our enterprise was well achiev'd, “‘As from their leader I his sword receiv'd, “‘His weapon, he exclaim'd, Plexertes gives, “‘For she it fail'd to save no longer lives. “‘Lo! where she lies; survey thy victim there, “‘And, if thy breast can feel, her infants spare. “‘I turn'd, and, in a cabin rear'd apart, “‘Beheld a scene of woe that wrung my heart. “‘A female lay out-stretch'd upon the ground, “‘On whose fair bosom through a gaping wound “‘The blood had now congeal'd; her eyes were clos'd, “‘Her pale cheek shew'd that she in death repos'd, “‘Yet with a grasp convulsive still she press'd “‘A tender infant to her clay-cold breast, “‘While at her side a blooming boy there stood, “‘Gazing with wonder on this scene of blood, “‘And with infantine lisp and piercing cries “‘Bidding her wake and ope again her eyes. “‘Ne'er did my soul such sense of pity know, “‘As when I view'd this spectacle of woe. “‘Fill'd with compassion, round her flock'd my crew. “‘From her cold breast th' unconscious babe I drew, “‘And to Plexertes gave it. When I took “‘The elder boy, with an endearing look “‘His little hands about my neck he flung, “‘And to my breast, as for protection, clung. “‘What might a father feel then first I knew: “‘Then, Melixertes—for the child was you— “‘With sympathy my rugged heart was mov'd; “‘I pitied thy distressful state, and lov'd. “‘Who claims this interesting boy? I cried. “‘The boy is mine, Plexertes straight replied, “‘I claim him by a father's sacred right. “‘Closer thou clasp'd me, shrinking with affright. “‘It cannot be, said I; his garb, his air, “‘A rank superior to thine own declare. “‘Do sons feel horror at a parent's name? “‘Reason and nature both reject thy claim. “‘Whose'er he be, th' appointing hand of heav'n “‘To me his sacred guardianship hath giv'n. “‘Go! when thy claim thou canst support by proof, “‘Thou'lt find the boy beneath my fost'ring roof.’— “As thus he spoke, he turn'd his head aside— “My guide, my model, my preserver died! “Forgive me this involuntary tear, “Which drops in mem'ry of a friend so dear; “Forgive me too, if licence I implore “With notice brief to pass my suff'rings o'er, “When, from my dungeon freed, by fate betray'd, “Me the stern Saracens a pris'ner made. “Omitting that which Thrasylus hath told, “Let me events more new and strange unfold. “By Dorimenes to his dwelling led, “To a lone chamber I was straight convey'd, “Where, by strong chains and massive bolts secur'd, “I spent the day in solitude immur'd. “As on the floor at night I sleepless lay, “Across my dungeon flash'd a sudden ray, “And wide the portal flew. My head I rear'd, “When Dorimenes with a lamp appear'd. “‘Approach,’ I cried, ‘If, as I guess, thou'rt come “‘To lead me to my long-expected doom, “‘I hail thy presence. When the deed is o'er, “‘Nor thou nor fortune can oppress me more.’ “He answered not, but with an aspect kind “Unlock'd the fetters which my limbs confin'd. “This done, ‘I marvel not that thou hast deem'd “‘Me thy first foe,’ he cried, ‘for such I seem'd: “‘Now list to me, while I the cause relate, “‘Which led me to avert thy threaten'd fate. “‘Heav'n for our mutual good inspir'd the thought. “‘Though to Icaria by my father brought “‘In early youth, still fervid and unstain'd “‘By pagan taint my christian faith remain'd. “‘Now freed by his decease from ev'ry tie “‘Which held me here, my duty bids me fly “‘This impious isle, and with a nobler aim “‘Court in auspicious climes a fairer fame. “‘Th' occasion, which I long had vainly sought, “‘Thy presence and impending danger brought. “‘When I beheld thee in the pow'r of those “‘Whom Saracenic vengeance made thy foes, “‘I knew that nought could save thee from thy fate, “‘But my still stronger claims and deeper hate. “‘I snatch'd thee from their hands: now, safe from all “‘The turban'd infidels who sought thy fall, “‘Beneath my roof thou may'st securely stay, “‘Till for escape we may devise a way.’ “Rejoic'd I heard him. How I answer made, “Or how my boundless gratitude display'd, “Need I express? In your own bosoms seek “Those gen'rous feelings which no words can speak. “When for my death th' appointed day was come, “As if in triumph to his father's tomb, “A faithful slave my kind preserver led, “Clad in an ample robe, which o'er his head, “As if to 'scape the clam'rous people's view, “With studied negligence he closely drew. “Arriv'd, mid shouts and yells of wild delight “From those assembled to behold the rite, “The dome they enter'd. There the trusty slave “An ample goblet to his master gave, “Fill'd with a kid's fresh blood, in which he dipp'd “The robe which from his confidant he stripp'd, “And, with his hands and garments stain'd with gore, “With frantic gesture rushing from the door, “‘Behold!’ he cried, ‘the sacrifice is done! “‘A father's death aton'd for by his son!’ “He threw the bloody vestment mid the crowd, “Who bore him home with acclamations loud. “Ere yet matur'd the plan we had arrang'd “By mournful tidings was my purpose chang'd. “A mariner, whom I had known of yore “When I resided on the Chian shore, “Reported, when that isle he left 'twas known “That, in his scheme to seize the Mysian throne, “Stratanor with Archilochus had join'd, “And, that their pact more strongly they might bind, “A fleet was mann'd with a well order'd host “To bear Lycoris to the Mysian coast, “Where, the sad victim of her father's pride, “She was condemn'd to be Stratanor's bride. “Before an image, so replete with dread, “All minor cares and apprehensions fled. “I sought my host, and when his friendly aid “I ask'd to succour the much injur'd maid, “His gen'rous nature with my suit complied. “I gain'd a bark, and o'er the ocean hied. “But ill accorded with my hopes the wind; “To my fond ardour prov'd the tides unkind: “In vain to reach the Chian shore we sought, “For pow'rs superior to our efforts wrought. “As through the trackless deep we held our way, “The low'ring sky, involv'd in vapours grey, “Gave signal of approaching storms. Ere long “From the black north a blast with influence strong “Impell'd us from our purpos'd course, and bore “Our fragile bark to the Mæonian shore. “We yielded to its potency, for vain “Prov'd our best skill to breast th' infuriate main. “Thus of my fondly cherish'd hope bereft, “The shatter'd vessel to its crew I left, “And from the strand in melancholy mood “Advancing reach'd this far-extending wood. “Still rag'd the storm; loud thunders roll'd on high, “In heavy drops dissolv'd the murky sky, “Against me rudely beat the rattling hail, “O'er my wild path night threw her somb'rous veil: “Rous'd by the din, the wolf and shaggy bear “Rush'd from their dens and left their lonely lair, “While the fierce bandit, who not less than they “At midnight prowling sought abroad for prey, “From the dark cave, where he was wont to hide, “With felon circuit rang'd the forest wide. “Its savage foragers with scowling eye “Upon me gaz'd, but pass'd innoxious by; “Less merciful my fellow man—A band “Of ruffians arm'd, e'er I their numbers scann'd, “Assail'd me suddenly. My single sword “Could small protection 'gainst their host afford; “Stagg'ring I sank beneath their efforts rude, “From many a gaping wound distill'd my blood, “My fleeting senses in a swoon were bound, “And motionless I press'd th' ensanguin'd ground. “The sun his noon-tide height had almost gain'd, “While senseless on the sod I still remain'd. “At length reviving, as I rais'd mine eyes, “With mingl'd admiration and surprise “A noble dame beside me I beheld, “Who, as by charity's kind call impell'd, “With her attendant damsels staunch'd the blood “That from my temples and my arm still flow'd, “And in my wounds a cordial balsam pour'd, “Whose potency my flitted sense restor'd. “Though time had robb'd of youthful bloom her face, “His hand had spar'd its sweet expressive grace; “With chasten'd lustre beam'd her gentle eye, “And heav'd her bosom with a frequent sigh, “While her pale countenance and pensive air “Too plainly spoke some inward-working care. “‘Hath heav'n,' with interrupted voice I said, “‘A succouring angel sent to bring me aid?’ “‘Alas;’ the lady sighing made reply, “‘A woman, wretched as thyself, am I. “‘But wherefore waste we time? Thy hurts demand “‘Instant attention and a leech's hand.’ “She said. Soon by her in her chariot plac'd, “Our course we gently to this castle trac'd. “Arriv'd, the lady with assiduous care “All that my weakness needed bad prepare. “When I enquir'd the name of her, whose heart “Thus in a stranger's woe could take such part, “I learnt 'twas Amatheia, once the bride “Of rich Leucaspion, whose possessions wide “Were by her brother, stern Cresphontes, sway'd, “Whose rule her vassals sullenly obey'd. “When fav'ring nature had reviv'd my pow'rs, “I counted with regret the useless hours, “Which, pass'd in ease, my purpos'd quest delay'd. “My means of travel speedily were made: “To my protectress kind I bade adieu, “And to the castle gate impatient flew. “I open'd it. The setting sun now cast “A golden radiance o'er the forest vast; “A solemn calm prevail'd; no passing breeze “Wanton'd with flitting touch among the trees, “But, as if nature in repose were bound, “One universal stillness reign'd around. “Onwards I stept, when lo! a sudden blast “'Gainst me with violence the portal cast. “Surpris'd, again I open'd it; again “A blast yet stronger my attempt made vain. “‘What can this prodigy import?’ I cried. “‘Is my departure then by heav'n denied?’ “As thus with hesitating voice I spoke, “An awful peal of thunder o'er me broke. “‘Heav'n answers me,’ thought I. ‘Whate'er its will, “‘Let me submissively my task fulfil.’ “With that, across the court my steps I bent, “And pensively to my lone chamber went: “There, with unusual drowsiness oppress'd, “Reclin'd upon my couch I sank to rest. “O'er my still lab'ring fancy, as I slept, “Visions of import strange confus'dly swept; “Imaginary forms and spectres vain, “In quick succession whirl'd across my brain. “At length, for long of nought defin'd I dream'd, “Methought around my couch a pale light gleam'd, “Through which I saw, with horror and surprise, “The ghastly semblance of a knight arise. “His air was noble, rich his burnish'd mail; “No helmet hid from view his visage pale; “His glaring eyes intently fix'd on mine, “To rise and follow him he gave me sign, “While a soul-harrowing silence still he kept, “As tow'rds my chamber door he slowly stept. “Methought I rose reluctant from my bed, “And follow'd awe-struck where the spectre led. “My shadowy guide advancing still, we pass'd “Through many a dreary hall and chamber vast, “Till to the eastern gallery we came. “He stopt—When lo! with a sulphureous flame, “And dismal sound, as if of stifled groans, “The phantom sank into a heap of bones! “As in mute awe my faculties were bound, “Methought, beneath my feet, wide op'd the ground, “And through the chasm I fell: with clangor dread “The solid pavement clos'd above my head. “Deep was the gloom around; no ray of light “Dispell'd the shade of universal night, “And rapid and precipitous my fall, “Till I alighted in a sumptuous hall, “With trophies and armorial bearings grac'd. “Here, in the midst, two splendid seats were plac'd; “On one Lycoris sat; with heav'nly glance “She bad me to the vacant seat advance. “Excess of transport now my slumbers broke, “The vision fled—to mis'ry I awoke. “But soon, by super-nat'ral pow'r oppress'd, “Again insensibly I sank to rest: “Again the same pale radiance was display'd, “Again the bleeding warrior's grisly shade “Before me rose. On his contracted brow “Displeasure sat. ‘Obey!’ in accents low “He cried, ‘Arise, and follow where I lead.’ “With that he turn'd, and with majestic tread “Forth at the portal stalk'd. Straight I awoke, “While round me thunders deep and hollow broke. “Seizing my sword, and snatching up a lamp, “Through halls I pass'd and courts obscure and damp, “Till, dimly guided by its trembling flame, “To the lone gall'ry in the east I came. “Impress'd with secret awe I stopt, for there “In my first dream I saw the shade repair. “Its walls were grac'd with many a trophy rude, “And many a faded portraiture I view'd “Of chiefs, who o'er the castle's wide domain Successively had held their feudal reign. “A careless look upon their range I glanc'd, “And quickly on my doubtful quest advanc'd, “When, chancing upon one to cast mine eyes, “I view'd with horror, mingled with surprise, “The well remember'd countenance of him, “Who led me hither in my former dream. “A thousand wild ideas fill'd my mind, “A secret dread of something undefin'd “Glanc'd o'er my soul; in mute suspense I stood, “While slowly ran my intermitting blood. “Sudden, the moon, emerging from a cloud “Which veil'd her radiance in a sable shroud, “Across the portrait beam'd her silv'ry light. “More strongly now the features struck my sight: “A touching air of mournfulness they wore, “While, with the truncheon which the warrior bore, “Tow'rds the torn tapestry which deck'd the wall “He seem'd to point, where in bright tints the fall “Of Agamemnon was describ'd, who died “By foul contrivance of his faithless bride. “As on the well-wrought texture still I gaz'd, “A sudden gust of wind the hangings rais'd, “And shew'd a door beneath. With hasty tread “Tow'rds it I rush'd, by pow'r resistless led. “It yielded to my effort. Night's deep shade “Within it all in tenfold gloom array'd. “My lamp advancing, on I slowly went, “But soon before me saw a steep descent, “Whose steps of stone, circling a column round, “Seem'd to be lost in the obscure profound. “With caution down the gloomy stair I pass'd, “Noting with heed the steps, and on the last “My foot had plac'd, when from beneath the stone “Burst forth a dismal and heart-rending groan. “My blood with horror curdled. Far and near “I gaz'd, but nothing could I see. My fear “Now to impatience yielding, as I turn'd, “Upon the wall adjacent I discern'd “Large gouttes of blood congeal'd. My eager look “I cast on them. The solid fabric shook, “My lamp emitted a more steady light, “When lo! as on the wall I fix'd my sight, “The crimson spots to liquify began, “And slowly trickling to the damp floor ran. “As with redoubled violence now beat “My throbbing heart, the stone beneath my feet “Totter'd, as if disjointed from the rest. “Again upon it anxiously I press'd: “Again it yielded to my force. No more “Could I restrain my ardour. On the floor “Placing my lamp, with all my strength applied “The pond'rous fragment to remove I tried. “I rais'd it—Heav'nly pow'rs! Beneath the stone “Mould'ring there lay a ghastly skeleton! “‘What myst'ry,’I exclaim'd, ‘what fearful end “‘Doth this soul-harrowing prodigy portend? “‘Why are these bones, unhears'd and long conceal'd “‘From mortal visitation, thus reveal'd? “‘To me, the feeble minister of heav'n, “‘Is the solution of the myst'ry giv'n? “‘If so it be, forewarn'd of its high will “‘My arm its dread commission shall fulfil. “‘Meantime, till Providence to guide me deign, “‘Poor mortal reliques! here untouch'd remain.’ “This said, the stone with rev'rence I replac'd, “And through the gloomy halls my way retrac'd. “No longer soothing sleep oblivion brought. “The tedious night I pass'd in anxious thought, “Till morning broke, when, on the past intent, “Forth from my chamber pensively I went. “The hall I travers'd, and the stately stair “Had just ascended, when the sorrowing fair, “The gracious Amatheia, I beheld. “Sad were her looks, her eyes with weeping swell'd; “But when we met, her feelings she restrain'd, “And kindly ask'd what had her guest detain'd. “To her demand I made a fit reply, “Then gazing round with an enquiring eye, “‘If for thy guidance,’ said I, ‘I might sue, “‘Those eastern halls and turrets I would view.’ “Awhile she stood, as if by thought oppress'd, “Then, sighing deeply, granted my request. “Through many a dreary hall our course we took, “Whose habitants, the bat and cawing rook, “Scar'd by our sudden entrance, with affright “From ev'ry mould'ring cornice took their flight. “Still I advanc'd with meditated aim, “Till to the fatal gallery we came. “Here my conductress, with an air that spoke “Feelings which artifice no more could cloak, “Implor'd me not to pass beyond. I gaz'd “Intently on her, as my hand I rais'd “To move the bar and ope the massive door. “More pale, more agitated than before “She seem'd, and still more horror-struck she grew, “When yielding to my touch the portal op'ning flew. “Ent'ring, of ev'ry chief I ask'd the name, “When he had liv'd, and how acquir'd his fame. “As vaguely to my questions she replied, “I notic'd that with troubled look she ey'd “The portrait, which to my astonish'd sight “Bore such resemblance to the spectre knight. “When I enquir'd his name, her colour fled, “She sigh'd, she wept, and hesitating said, “‘Alas! forgive me, for my tears will flow— “‘Him for Leucaspion, once my husband, know— “‘Ah! save! protect me!’—She could add no more, “For with a crash astounding to the floor “Sudden the portrait fell.—‘It was not I!’ “Exclaim'd she with a loud and fearful cry; “‘It was not I who slew him!—Saidst thou not “‘When he was buried he would be forgot? “‘How glares his eye!—Oh spare, in pity spare! “‘Save me from madness, agony, despair!’ “As thus she spoke, convulsions rack'd her frame, “She shriek'd, she fell, and motionless became. “At length, she slowly rais'd her drooping head, “And thus, while sighs oft check'd her utt'rance, said. “‘Soon will the troubled dream of life be o'er: “‘My fragile bark is hast'ning to the shore, “‘Where death awaits, the mourner's only friend. “‘Yet, ere my long protracted mis'ries end, “‘A truth, which conscience may no more conceal, “‘Must I to thee in confidence reveal. “‘To brave Leucaspion when I pledg'd my vows, “‘And to this castle came his happy spouse, “‘When, ere its tranquil course a year had run, “‘To my fond breast I clasp'd an infant son, “‘Vainly I trusted that a bliss so pure “‘Would undiminish'd through our lives endure. “‘Alas! to blast my hopes Cresphontes came, “‘Once my lov'd brother, now my scorn and shame. “‘O'er my kind husband's unsuspecting heart “‘He practis'd with such smooth, such specious art, “‘That soon from me, his once lov'd spouse, estrang'd, “‘To icy coldness his affection chang'd. “‘Assuming now a brother's tender care, “‘Cresphontes seem'd in my distress to share, “‘And, when he saw how well his plans had wrought, “‘How my mov'd soul to second him was brought, “‘Sister, said he, an herb I know, whose force “‘Affection traces to its hidden source, “‘Restores the truant to his slighted spouse, “‘Fond as when first he breath'd his ardent vows. “‘This sov'reign med'cine straight will I prepare, “‘To minister the draught be thine the care. “‘Too ample credence to his tale I lent, “‘Too rashly seconded his vile intent! “‘He drugg'd the fatal bowl—Leucaspion drank— “‘Convuls'd and senseless at my feet he sank.— “‘My senses fled; for days, for months I rav'd, “‘And pardon of my wrong'd Leucaspion crav'd, “‘Till, when his trait'rous purpose was complete, “‘Cresphontes sought me in my lone retreat. “‘On thee, said he, devolves this wide domain; “‘Its care and governance will I retain: “‘Nor fear Leucaspion e'er again should rise, “‘For safely 'neath yon stair entomb'd he lies. “‘Now mark me well. If or by look or speech “‘Thou rashly dar'st my character impeach, “‘To all the inmates here who own my sway, “‘To the whole world will I thy guilt display, “‘Proclaim thee as a false disloyal wife, “‘Whose hand accurs'd abridg'd thy husband's life. “‘I shrank beneath his menace, but implor'd “‘That to mine arms my son might be restor'd. “‘Such boon, said he, 'tis bootless now to crave: “‘For to Plexertes when the boy I gave—’ “Scarce had her trembling lips Plexertes nam'd, “When in impassion'd accents I exclaim'd, “‘I, I am he, thy son! Relenting heav'n “‘To bless thine age thy long lost child hath giv'n!’ “She rais'd her languid eye, but nothing spoke; “Life's feeble thread with the exertion broke. “One moment to mine arms a mother gave, “The next consign'd that mother to the grave!” CANTO VI. He ceas'd. A tear distill'd from every eye, From ev'ry pitying bosom burst a sigh. But soon to views more cheering and more gay The sad reflections he had rais'd gave way; For now, as if to add a keener zest To the serene delight which fill'd each breast, Alcimedon, his task perform'd, return'd. With what kind sentiments his bosom yearn'd When Melixertes he again beheld, How with alternate grief and pleasure swell'd His manly breast, as he rehears'd his fate, Now mark'd by joy as erst by fortune's hate, Those hearts alone can adequately guess, Which other's pains can wound, and other's transports bless. Meantime, Prothenor had proclaim'd to all, Whose gallant hearts beat high at glory's call, That he a solemn tournament would hold, At which each foreign knight and champion bold Was call'd to prove his might in equal arms, And vindicate his sov'reign lady's charms. Soon as around the welcome rumour spread, Thither full many a val'rous warrior sped, Elate with gen'rous hope to purchase fame, And register in glory's page their name. Some from Abydos, where Leander brave For Hero dar'd the Hellespontic wave, From rich Pactolus some, whose waters glide O'er golden sands, or from Mæanders tide; Nor were there wanting those, who, on the bank Of fam'd Scamander, of those waters drank, Which erst, distain'd with Greek and Trojan blood, The madd'ning rage of Peleus' son withstood. These, high in hope to win the martial prize, And reap fresh honour in their ladies' eyes, On ev'ry hand with emulative haste Their jocund course to proud Larissa trac'd. The setting sun had nearly reach'd the main, When fair Zapheria and her gallant train Arriv'd in safety at Mæonia's court. When Caria's prince beheld the throng'd resort Of mingling warriors, who with gay parade Their banners and resplendent arms display'd, Though from the secret grief which pang'd his heart Averse to bear in scenes like these a part, His gen'rous soul, with native valour fraught, A portion of the gen'ral transport caught: The flint resembling, whose exterior dark Of latent fire contains a dormant spark, Which, rous'd to action by extrinsic force, Bursts into flame, and proves its heav'nly source. But these to softer sentiments gave place, When, lock'd in his lov'd father's fond embrace, To all his filial duty which could prove, His undiminish'd tenderness and love, In speechless joy he gave unbounded course. Nor did affection with inferior force Act on Chrysulphus' breast. He smil'd, he wept, As varied feelings o'er his bosom swept, Reproaching mildly now his truant son, Now asking through what perils he had run, Now hailing his Zapheria's welcome sight, Now gazing on them both in mute delight. But soon in either breast new thoughts awoke, When greetings kind Mæonia's monarch spoke, And bad the prince at morrow's dawn prepare In deeds of knightly worth to take his share. Soon as his wish Prothenor thus express'd, Th' impatient prince, well pleas'd with his request, Permission crav'd, that, clad in equal arms, His lance might vindicate the matchless charms Of the fair dames who grac'd Larissa's court, And 'gainst all comers their desert support. “Illustrious prince.” Prothenor gladly cried, “A wish so gallant may not be denied. “To hold the lists thy licence I proclaim, “And trust to thy defence my daughters' fame. “Lo! where they come. Behold them, and declare “If Asia boast a more accomplish'd pair.” As on the portal wide he turn'd his glance, Th' expecting prince beheld the train advance. Amid her damsels, Chariclea first On his rapt view in all her splendor burst, Nor marvell'd he her beauties could impart Feelings so strong to Orosmanes' heart. While yet he gaz'd on her, Hermilia fair, With sylphid form advanc'd and winning air. He turn'd—What, heav'nly pow'rs! was his surprise, When his unknown enslaver met his eyes! Starting, he seem'd as rooted to the ground, His ev'ry sense in speechless rapture bound, While, as on him she look'd, a tinge of red With momentary flush her cheek o'erspread, And play'd around her mouth and azure eyes A smile of mingled pleasure and surprise. With strong emotions heav'd his lab'ring breast, And ill his salutations he express'd To her, the long sought object of his choice: Flush'd was his face and tremulous his voice; And he, who ne'er had fear'd his foe in arms, Stood cow'd and daunted by a lady's charms. But brief their converse prov'd. Prothenor's call Summon'd the sisters from the crowded hall. As they obeying through the portal pass'd, On them the prince a look impatient cast, And to Zapheria cried, “This, this is she, “The star that guides and rules my destiny! “Oh! if thou lov'st me, my fond ardour aid, “Use all thine influence with the lovely maid, “That at her feet I may disclose my flame, “Avow my love, and her approval claim.” “Trust to my zeal,” the smiling fair replied; “Meantime thine ecstacy let prudence guide. “Come and with me the royal banquet share; “Then for to-morrow's tournament prepare: “There signalize thy worth; shew her how well “Thou canst in her behoof all rival knights excel.” Soon as the first glad ray of morning gleam'd, Or ere the sun's resplendent lustre stream'd, The trumpet's voice, re-echoing from afar, Invited to the scene of mimic war. Its cheering call the martial youth obey'd: In splendid casque and panoply array'd, Champions were seen, who on their coursers fleet In gorgeous state paraded through each street, All to the lists repairing, where were plac'd Balconies high with gold and tap'stry grac'd, One for the judges of the field, and one For him who fill'd Mæonia's pow'rful throne. His royal presence soon th' assembly cheer'd. On his right hand the Carian king appear'd, And near them in becoming state were seen Beauties, like those who on th' Idalian queen Attendant wait, while in her Cyprian grove With loosen'd zone they sport with infant love. Soon as the clarion's warning note was heard, With ten stout knights the Carian prince appear'd. On a barb'd steed, that seem'd to mock the rein, He travers'd with impetuous course the plain. His rich cuirass of silver scales was made, Which well his form's just symmetry display'd, With rubies dug from Indian mines emboss'd. A 'broider'd scarf his manly bosom cross'd, Splendid with variegated silks and gold, Which waving hung in many a graceful fold. A helm of polish'd steel adorn'd his head, Whence rose an ostrich plume, that proudly spread Like a wide canopy on ev'ry side, With deepest shades of vivid crimson dyed. An ashen spear he pois'd, which erst had stood The tow'ring pride of the adjacent wood, And on his arm he bore a massive shield, Which shew'd, impress'd on its enamell'd field. An eagle soaring tow'rds the mid-day sun, With this device—“I aim at that alone.” A trumpet's pealing voice arose again, And straight advanc'd the bold opposing train. The ten arm'd knights who form'd the band were led By Stratocles, whom Phrygia's plains had bred, In courtly tournament and hostile field Practis'd alike to wield his lance and shield. Nor was his test of valour long delay'd; For now the signal of attack was made: Each vig'rous charger, spurning the tight rein, His rider bore across the sounding plain, And ev'ry champion, singling out his foe, Prepar'd to give or ward the menac'd blow. Brief prov'd the contest. Of the courtly train None could the onset of their foes sustain; Shortly they fell, and, hopeless of relief, Alone remain'd the gallant Carian chief. When thus of all apparent aid bereft The fair Zapheria saw her brother left, O'er the wide field she cast her anxious eye, Doubtful, yet hoping she might yet descry At this eventful moment some bold knight, Whose pow'rful succour might restore the fight. When no approaching champion she discern'd, To Theron, who behind her stood, she turn'd, And with a voice by terror check'd exclaim'd, “Alas! must thus the royal cause be sham'd? “Where are the vaunting minions of the court? “Will none my lov'd Alcimedon support? “Oh! that I could unsex myself, and wield “In such a glorious cause my spear and shield!” She paus'd, she turn'd, as outcries loud arose, And saw her brother circled by his foes, Who, all undaunted by th' unequal fight, So well, so valiantly display'd his might, That to the ground th' attendant knights he brought, And Stratocles, his sole opponent, sought, Who, with the hope of glorious conquest fir'd, No less to prosecute the fray desir'd. As when for mast'ry rival bulls contend, Prone to the earth their sinewy necks they bend, With fury gleam their eye-balls, while amain With adverse front they rush across the plain, So for a while, in no less vengeful mood, His 'vantage spying, either champion stood. But soon bold Stratocles with spear in rest Aim'd at his gallant adversary's breast; Caught on the boss of his enamell'd shield, It fell in scatter'd fragments on the field. With surer destination 'gainst his foe Came from the arm of Caria's prince his blow; Full in the centre of his breast he smote, Bruis'd the bright steel, and rent his gay surcoat: Over the crupper borne, upon the ground He falls, and loud his shatter'd arms resound. Th' exulting prince, who now at last conceiv'd The labours of the day were well achiev'd, To take from beauty's hand his hard-earn'd meed Directed 'cross the lists his foaming steed, When from the barrier a shrill clarion's note, Breathing defiance loud, the still air smote. The prince, with wonder fill'd, his courser turn'd, When lo! a stranger champion he discern'd, Who, bravely mounted, and with slacken'd rein, Enter'd the lists, and scour'd across the plain. A sable helm and haubergeon he wore, With sable plumage; on his arm he bore An ample shield, on which was seen impress'd A phœnix couching on its flaming nest, With this device—“I gloriously expire, “When from a heav'nly source descends the fire.” With wonder all on his appearance gaz'd, Some his bold mien, his well-form'd limbs some prais'd, At length his courser's ardour he repress'd, And thus in courteous guise the prince address'd. “Deem it not strange, illustrious prince, that I, “A stranger, thus thy prowess should defy; “Nor hold me rash, if of Mæonia's dames, “Champion'd by thee, I thus dispute the claims. “Insensible were he to beauty's sway, “Who to such splendour would not homage pay; “But though their excellence I freely own, “I owe allegiance to another throne, “And, while life's current flows through ev'ry vein, “My lady's charms superior I maintain.” As thus he spoke, to the balcony high Where the princesses sat he rais'd his eye, And bowing lowly to Aspasia fair, Prov'd that his homage was directed there. Suffus'd became her cheek with vivid red, As to Zapheria thus she whisp'ring said, “Heard I aright? They surely are the same— “That voice, that mien, Bithynia's king proclaim— “Such was his tender language, such his look, “Ere his oft-vow'd allegiance he forsook—” As thus she spoke, the trumpet's pealing bray Provok'd the champions to commence their fray. With dread assault they met. Far o'er the ground The fragments of their lances fell around, And the strange warrior call'd aloud for more, When the spent charger, which the Carian bore, Sank with his rider on the dusty field. Instant, as lustily a clarion peal'd, A knight advanc'd. Meagre and gaunt his steed, As unaccustom'd long to gen'rous feed; His bridle brown with rust, his chanfront worn, His once gay trappings into tatters torn. Nor less unseemly were the hauberk old Which cas'd him round with many an awkward fold, And his mean helm without or plume or crest, Which no chivalric worthiness express'd. Of rudest workmanship he bore a spear; Of emblem or device his shield was clear: In all was he accoutr'd worse than those Who the vile refuse of a camp compose; Yet, though his rude exterior shew'd so base, It fail'd to hide a manly form and grace, A noble presence, and a martial air, Which no gay arms could give, no want of them impair. At first, with wonder all around survey'd A knight so mounted and so ill array'd, But soon to mirth was their amazement chang'd, When his lean courser o'er the champaign rang'd With clumsy trot, which not his rider's spur, Though oft applied, could to a gallop stir. Their gibes and taunts the knight regarded not: Still held he on his way, till to the spot He came, where proudly sat the sable knight, His fallen foe provoking to the fight. Then with a voice sonorous, clear and sweet, “Turn,” he exclaim'd, “turn, haughty chief, and meet “A foe, who better can thy force withstand, “And snatch the wreath of vict'ry from thine hand.” “And who art thou?” the sable champion cried, “By whom thus haughtily I am defied?” “By whom thou art defied, I need not say,” Replied the stranger; “but this long delay “Protracts the time, when haply thou may'st know “How rash it is to judge from outward shew.” He said, and vigorously impell'd his steed, Who, now provok'd to use his utmost speed, With unexpected nimbleness and force Bore his bold rider through his destin'd course, On whose plain buckler his opponent's lance Swerving impeded not his firm advance, While his own spear, more dext'rously applied, Pierc'd his stout foeman's shield, and reach'd his side. So forcibly he struck him and so well, That to the earth both horse and rider fell. Inflam'd by this disgrace, the sable knight Leapt from the ground, still eager for the fight; Nor was his brave antagonist more slow On foot to meet the meditated blow. In conflict close engaging, hand to hand Each wav'd on high his keenly-trenchant brand, And, as it fell with fulminating sound, Full many a scatter'd fragment strew'd the ground. At length, as if he would his foe o'erwhelm, The sable knight on his ill-temper'd helm Struck with rude force. The vizor shiv'ring flew, And, lo! Perinthus was reveal'd to view. With horror and amazement fill'd, the crowd Echo'd his name with execrations loud. “'Tis he, Perinthus! He, whose felon hand “The death of Caria's monarch foully plann'd!” Quick spread the cry, as, when across wide heav'n With lightnings charg'd sulphureous clouds are driv'n, Low peals of thunder first remotely roll, Till, with loud crash that scares the guilty soul Tremendously they burst, and shake the distant pole. Soon as Perinthus' hateful name he heard, Prothenor, rising, with his hand up-rear'd, Gave instant order to th' attendant guard To seize and keep him in their strictest ward: But he, when he perceiv'd them drawing near, Light vaulting on his courser couch'd his spear, And, with an air and voice of high disdain, Bad them on peril of their lives abstain. Regardless they their forward march pursued, While he awaited their encounter rude, When suddenly from the balcony high He heard a fearful and heart-rending cry. As when, returning from her quest of blood, A tigress hears the outcry of her brood Whom hunters bear away, rage fills her soul, With phrenzy's fire her glaring eye-balls roll; So, when Perinthus upwards cast his glance, And on her seat extended in a trance Beheld Zapheria, lost to all beside, As in wild accents on her name he cried, Through the thick mass of combatants he charg'd, With giant vigour their thinn'd ranks enlarg'd, Till, at the entrance of the royal seat Arriv'd, while ev'ry pulse with ardour beat, He leapt to earth, and to advance essay'd. The thronging guard his progress would have stay'd; But he, intent upon the fainting fair, Seem'd to collect new vigour from despair. Though both his spear and sword were thrown aside, His courage more than armouries supplied, And, with a strength that mock'd all mortal pow'r, Firmly he stood, like a sea-girted tow'r, 'Gainst which in vain vex'd waves their rage exert, Nor ocean's fury can its base subvert. The servile crowd, who his destruction sought, Deem'd him with more than human prowess fraught: An air so noble, so sublime a mien, Never before in mortal shape were seen; In strength Alcides, Ganymede in face, Apollo's self in elegance and grace, While o'er his martial brow his ringlets stream'd, And from his eyes terrific lightnings gleam'd, Where'er he turn'd his angry glance, his foes Shrank back, nor dar'd his dread assault oppose. From their exalted seat, the kings amaz'd On him who thus disdain'd their vengeance gaz'd, Till starting from his throne Chrysulphus cried, “Too long this traitor hath our pow'r defied! “Though yonder dastards tim'rously fall back, “Nor dare abide a single foe's attack, “This aged arm, unpractis'd long in fight, “May yet avail to vindicate our right.” He said, and forwards rush'd. When from her trance Zapheria wak'ning saw her sire advance, In speechless agony his robe she held; Her heaving breast with dread and horror swell'd. As from her grasp convuls'd he sought release. Shrieking aloud she cried, “Perinthus, cease! “Yield thee for pity.—Stop this hideous strife.— “Zapheria sues,—respect her father's life!” “'Tis o'er,” Perinthus cried, “that magic voice “Unnerves my arm, and leaves no wav'ring choice. “To thee, oh king! I yield myself. Whate'er “Thy sentence prove submissively I bear.” “Lead him to death!” the furious king exclaim'd. “Such be his doom, who 'gainst his sov'reign aim'd.” “To heav'n I leave! exclaim'd th' indignant youth, “The vindication of my spotless truth.—” “Such frontless confidence augments thy crime,” Replied the now more wrathful king. “'Tis time “Insulted heav'n should vindicate its cause, “And teach mankind to venerate its laws!” “Ah be not thus extreme!” Zapheria cried, “Do not with such severity decide. “Give him yet time,”—“Away!” Chrysulphus said, “Plead not, for justice may not be delay'd. “Too long we parley!”—when Zapheria saw The guard obedient tow'rds Perinthus draw, She shudder'd, paleness o'er her visage spread, Her quiv'ring pulses stopt, her senses fled. The king, distracted, for a while survey'd, As at his feet she lay, the fainting maid, Then calling to his guard, “From this dread spot “Remove her straight—These horrors suit her not.” Rais'd from the ground the guard bore off the fair. “Now for the fate which suits thy crimes prepare,” Sternly he cried; “By instant death alone “Can'st thou for treasons manifest atone.” “Clear is my soul,” said he, “from such foul stain, “And treason's imputation I disdain. “I stand obnoxious to thy stern decree, “For thou art master of my destiny: “But did'st thou know 'gainst whom thy censure aims, “Could'st thou but guess how pow'rful are the claims “Which he, now subject to thy stern controul, “Hath on the noblest feelings of thy soul, “Thou would'st not thus anticipate the hour, “When vain regret thy bosom must devour.” “Thy words a meaning dark and strange convey,” Replied the Carian king, “Who art thou? Say.” “No longer now my lineage need I hide,” The youth with conscious dignity replied. “My father's name long grac'd the Mysian line; “Androcles his, and Aracynthus mine!” As thus with manly confidence he spoke, Throughout the crowd admiring murmurs broke: Chrysulphus for a while, in thoughtful mood, As if uncertain of his purpose stood, But shortly with increasing wrath inflam'd, “Think not, presumptuous pleader,” he exclaim'd, “By flimsy arts like these to 'scape the fate “Which on depravity like thine must wait. “Thou Aracynthus! thou assume the name “Of that brave youth, the favourite son of fame! “Away! Such insolence surpassing thought “Enhances all the treasons thou hast wrought.” “Do not his fate thus hastily decide,” Alcimedon between them rushing cried. “See in that mien, in that ingenuous face “If e'en suspicion lurking guilt can trace. “If to his sire Alcimedon be dear, “Doom not his death; recal the word severe “Which passion rashly spoke. His worth I prov'd: “To him, my sire, thou ow'st a son belov'd; “Suspend thy fatal sentence; give him time “To clear his honour from imputed crime.” “Be it so then,” replied the frowning king; “Let him the proof of his assertion bring. “Meantime, in strictest ward he must remain. “All farther interference will be vain!” Thus spake he with indignant feelings fir'd, And with Prothenor from the lists retir'd. “Now, gallant prince,” the heir of Caria cried, “For thy deliv'rance shall my care provide. “Assur'd of thy chivalric worth, my breast “Rests with a holy confidence impress'd “That, like yon thin and evanescent clouds, “The foul suspicion, which thy merit shrouds, “Will shortly fade before conviction's ray, “And shew thy virtues in resplendent day. “Farewell! To Orosmanes I repair. “Meantime, with patience thy brief thraldom bear.” A tedious day in twilight now had clos'd, And labour's wearied hand from toil repos'd, When a stout knight in chivalrous array To King Chrysulphus' mansion bent his way. “Tell your good king,” said he, “his humble slave “Hyperbius comes, and would an audience crave.” Not long the king his welcome suit delay'd. Soon as his fitting homage he had paid, The monarch, who, since first the knight he knew, Had ever deem'd him to his service true, Spoke of what most his troubled mind engag'd. In accents flowing from a heart enrag'd He told of what had pass'd, then ask'd if yet He had the false Bithynian monarch met, And if his arm, in righteous cause so strong, Had well aveng'd his lov'd Aspasia's wrong. “We met and we engag'd,” replied the knight, “And long in equal balance hung our fight: “Weaken'd by loss of blood from many a wound, “At length we sank exhausted on the ground. “Some swains, who haply pass'd th' ensanguin'd spot, “In pity bore me to their shelt'ring cot, “Where they administer'd assistance due; “But what Artaces' fate I never knew. “Long time I there remain'd; and when at length “Kind heav'n was pleas'd to renovate my strength, “To my adopted home, to thy abode, “By easy journies leisurely I rode. “Near this, I chanc'd to hear of thy resort “With thy fair daughters to Larissa's court: “Inflam'd with zeal, my purpos'd course I check'd “And hither came to pay my due respect.” Scarce had he ended, when with loud acclaim They heard re-echo'd Orosmanes' name, And, sudden, op'ning wide the portal flew, And both the princes met their eager view. “Where is the youth,” the Mysian king exclaim'd, “Who hath himself as Aracynthus nam'd? “Forgive me, to affection's powerful sway “If the respect I owe to thee give way—” “Son of my valued friend!” replied the king, “Check not emotions which from virtue spring. “The pris'ner is at hand. Produce him straight! “Thy voice impartial shall pronounce his fate.” Straight op'd the portal. By his guard beset, Their eager gaze the gallant captive met. Not like a culprit, who with dread surveys Her blood-stain'd glaive avenging justice raise, But like a mighty king, with glory crown'd, Whose car triumphant vanquish'd chiefs surround, While from his eye indignant flashes glanc'd, Firmly with mien undaunted he advanc'd. Him in his arms as Orosmanes caught, “Oh, bliss!” exclaimed he, “far surpassing thought, “Do I again my Aracynthus hold? “Is it my long lost brother I infold? “Royal Chrysulphus! If thine heart can feel, “To that I make my confident appeal. “If thou hast e'er fraternal fondness prov'd, “If e'er my father was by thee belov'd, “For him, for me, my Aracynthus spare! “By my best hopes of happiness I swear “His soul from taint disloyal must be free. “Not Asia holds a nobler youth than he!” “Thou may'st not,” said Chrysulphus, “plead in vain. “Release your pris'ner, guards! unloose his chain!” Awhile the youth the gen'rous king survey'd, Then, while emotion check'd his voice, he said, “Whate'er it cost, I will no more withhold “The secret of my soul so long untold: “I will to thee the thought, the hope impart, “Till now deep lodg'd in my retentive heart; “So sacred lodg'd, no motive, short of those “Which rule that heart, could make my lips disclose.” “Though,” said Hyperbius, “Caria's king may deem “My service not unworthy of esteem, “Whether to trust a man thou hast not tried “May meet thy wish, thou only can'st decide. “If not, when once appris'd of thy desire, “With def'rence from this presence I retire.” “Thy diffidence,” the Carian king replied, “Must not thy worth and oft tried merit hide. “Well can I vouch them. In thy faithful breast “The secrets I impart securely rest.” “If such thy confidence,” the prince replied, “To one so honour'd, be not mine denied.” CANTO VII. Deep silence reign'd, when thus commenc'd the youth. “The secret of my soul to tell, my truth “To vindicate from blame when I essay, “Let fair construction my brief tale repay. “When Orosmanes Mysia's throne had left, “Of the delight his presence gave bereft, “With my lov'd mother and my sister kind “I sought to calm my agitated mind: “For oft, in lonely visions of the night, “My brother's image floated in my sight; “Now waves broke o'er him with o'erwhelming force, “Now on the strand I saw his lifeless corse, “Now in a dungeon dark I heard him sigh, “No pitying friend, no soothing succour nigh: “Nor, when the cheering sun upon me smil'd, “With hopes more soothing was my heart beguil'd; “For fancy still, in tints of sombrous hue, “Sketches of wild fantastic horrors drew. “Anticipating thus imagin'd woe, “One eve I wander'd forth with footsteps slow; “Wearied at length, upon a mossy bank “Reclin'd, into a slumber deep I sank. “The anxious thoughts which vex'd my waking mind, “Now took a flight more free and unconfin'd. “Methought I rang'd amid the vaults, where lie “The relics of our royal ancestry. “As ev'ry sepulchre I pass'd, I read “The vaunting titles of th' illustrious dead, “Survey'd their banners, now to fragments torn, “The helms and armour which they once had worn. “Pursuing still my visionary way, “The tomb I reach'd where my lov'd father lay. “As I bent o'er it, through the vaults around “Arose a soft and gently soothing sound; “Like that from rich Sabæan shrubs distill'd “The spacious dome a balmy fragrance fill'd; “A light, more lucid than the golden ray “Which in the east proclaims approaching day, “Around with vivid corruscation play'd, “Through which I saw what seem'd my father's shade, “Not as he look'd when I his form had known, “By length of years and worldly care bent down, “But firm of strength, energic, and sublime, “Like some young warrior in his early prime. “I bent my knee, impress'd with awe and dread, “While smiling thus the blissful vision said. “‘To calm thy troubled soul and ease thy woe, “‘Awhile those peaceful regions I forego, “‘Where, when their transitory labours close, “‘The spirits of the just and brave repose. “‘Know, my lov'd son, th' unerring will of heav'n “‘To mortals their allotted tasks hath giv'n. “‘'Tis thine to deck with honours proud thy race, “‘And past desert with new achievements grace. “‘Set forth.—Let virtue lead thee to renown; “‘Let love and regal sway thine efforts crown!’ “No more he said.

“From that blest moment I her slave became, “And nourish'd in my breast a sacred flame; “I liv'd but in her presence; ev'ry thought “From her its hue by inspiration caught: “Whate'er of virtue lurk'd within my mind “Became from her example more refin'd, “Whate'er of ill had there admission gain'd “Her purity or banish'd or restrain'd; “From her my ev'ry thought and action sprung, “Her eyes my guide, my oracle her tongue; “The silent vassal of her charms I bow'd, “Exulting in my fate, and of her fetters proud. “Judge then, oh king! if my subjected heart “Could 'gainst her sister act a traitor's part, “If he, who liv'd but in Zapheria's sight, “Could so ungratefully her smiles requite. “No—When appearance most my treason prov'd, “Then most Zapheria and thyself I lov'd, “And when opposing thee my sword I drew, “Then to thy service was my soul most true. “When at Miletus by thy favour blest, “No cares but those of love annoy'd my breast. “Haply till now by his soft bonds enchain'd “Had I in willing vassalage remain'd, “If the sad tidings which from Mysia came “Had not arous'd at once my grief and shame. “That hapless country without ruler left, “My honour'd mother of her sons bereft, “Her troops discomfitted, her leaders foil'd; “A picture form'd at which my heart recoil'd: “With patriot zeal my love I almost blam'd, “And vow'd to do what filial duty claim'd. “Yet when compell'd to quit the maid I lov'd, “How painful was the conflict which I prov'd! “I felt my weakness.—Like a feeble vine “Whose tendrils some fair poplar's stem entwine, “When from its sole supporter torn away, “Its flow'rets fade, its verdant leaves decay, “My soul enamour'd yielded to the stroke, “Which thus at once its fond dependence broke. “But soon recurr'd my suff'ring country's wrong, “And my breast felt with firmer purpose strong. “No moment's pause I made, but quick as thought “Arms, steeds, attendants suddenly I sought, “And dreading all the magic of her sight, “Th' adieu I durst not risk I meant to write; “And thus, by honour and by duty fir'd, “In secret from the palace I retir'd, “And to the wood, which tow'rds Mæonia leads, “Bad my esquires forthwith conduct my steeds, “And wait my coming. As I hasten'd there, “Array'd in arms, though without shield or spear, “Involv'd in thought and pond'ring on my woes, “The clash of arms I heard, and cries arose, “And lo! approaching near a knight I view'd, “Whom an arm'd band of warriors close pursued “On lusty coursers mounted, while his steed, “O'erspent with toil, no further could proceed. “‘Sir knight!’ exclaim'd he, ‘if thy bold heart knows “‘The transport which from gen'rous pity flows, “‘Save me, I pray, in this unequal strife, “‘Where treach'rous numbers seek a single life. “‘Take my good shield, awhile this post maintain, “‘Till I, refresh'd, thine efforts may sustain.’ “Scarce had I caught the buckler which he threw, “When the fierce horsemen to assault me flew; “But, as the shield I rais'd to guard my head, “Sudden they turn'd, and o'er the champaign fled: “Others advanc'd as if to prove my might, “Yet instantly betook themselves to flight. “Wond'ring what this might mean, mine eyes I turn'd, “Yet no where him for whom I fought discern'd, “For the mean dastard from the strife had flown, “And left me to sustain its brunt alone. “No time for thought was giv'n. The chief who led “The troop, a blow directed at my head, “Whose weight and force the stoutest might o'erwhelm. “In shivers fell the vizor of my helm. “I stagger'd, but the pow'rful shock sustain'd. “The chief improv'd th' advantage he had gain'd, “And aim'd a second blow, which on my shield “I caught, and struck him senseless on the field. “Instant arose a cry, ‘The king is slain! “‘Avenge his fall! Th' assassin foul detain! “‘Seize on the Dragon Knight!’ The dreadful sound “My ev'ry faculty in torpor bound; “A tender infant with a silken thread “Me as his captive might with ease have led, “Yet no one dar'd to seize me; all retir'd, “As if with some mysterious awe inspir'd. “But soon returning recollection brought “An influx wild of agonizing thought, “Like a huge wave, which o'er its vex'd compeers “Its giant mass pre-eminently rears, “Till, breaking on the shore with deaf'ning sound, “Foaming it deluges the beach around. “In one brief moment my distracted mind “A thousand tort'ring images combin'd. “To yield myself to obloquy, and shame— “To forfeit ev'ry hope of glorious fame— “My mother calling on her son for aid— “My suff'ring country—My lov'd father's shade— “Remorse, affection, duty, honour, love, “Like a rude chaos in my bosom strove. “Distractedly I stood, till reason's voice “Struck my mov'd soul, and fix'd my varying choice. “Ere my assailants could their charge renew, “To the wide precincts of the wood I flew; “Plung'd in the forest's gloom, its paths I cross'd, “And soon the sound of my pursuers lost.” “Enough!” Chrysulphus cried, “illustrious youth, “Mirror of chivalry and knightly truth! “Thus in a fond embrace all doubts I end. “Henceforth become my truest, dearest friend; “More if thou will'st, nay all that thou can'st claim “To clear thine honour and restore thy fame. “Take my Zapheria, and may fav'ring heav'n “Sanction the boon by love paternal giv'n!” “Feebly can words,” replied the youth, “impart “The pow'rful feelings which oppress my heart. “Oh say! how best can Aracynthus prove “His boundless duty, gratitude and love? “Tax me to all that human pow'rs can do, “Bid me encounter perils strange and new; “Though death itself in opposition stand, “Thine is my service, thine my faithful hand!” “'Tis nobly spoken,” Caria's monarch said. “I prize thy virtue, and accept thine aid. “That secret foe, whose machinations dread “Have terror and dismay through Caria spread, “That Dragon Knight, whose efforts oft-renew'd “For three long years Aspasia have pursued, “Him to thy vengeance, prince, do I consign. “No less was he approv'd thy foe than mine:” “'Tis well,” the prince replied; “ere the bright sun “Through yonder heav'n his course again shall run, “Will I, to execute thy high behest, “With strenuous zeal commence my vent'rous quest.” “To thee,” replied the king, “my cause I trust. “May glory crown thee as that cause is just! “But now the waning night demands repose: “Mark where the dawn's first tint already glows, “And the shrill herald of approaching day “Hence to our couches summons us away. “Farewell—To-morrow we again shall meet, “And of our purpos'd plans more largely treat.” “Permit, most royal Sir,” Hyperbius said, “That now my parting reverence be made. “There is a cause, of grave and high import, “Which claims my instant absence from thy court. “Strong it indeed must be, which makes me part “From those who rule my duty and my heart.” “What hath occurr'd,” the Carian monarch cried, “To make thee thus so suddenly decide? “Did'st thou not say, that with the sole intent “Of seeing me thy steps were hither bent?” “When to thy presence brought,” the knight rejoin'd, “No selfish thought could occupy my mind; “Such was thy condescendence, such thy grace, “No meaner feelings in my heart had place. “'Tis honour, royal Sir, which calls me hence: “Of that untainted honour the defence “Chrysulphus, whose example bright may teach “Aspirants to renown, will not impeach. “No! when he learns what motives strong demand “My urgent haste and enterprising hand, “I fear his noble soul will rather blame “A seeming inattention to my fame. “Know then, when weaken'd by my wounds I lay, “A knight, with whom I once had had a fray, “Pass'd by the cot. Noting my feeble state, “And foully mov'd by long engender'd hate, “In terms of rude reproach, such as no knight “Could brook to hear, he dar'd me to the fight. “I seiz'd my sword, but my unequal hand “Refus'd to aid the vengeance I had plann'd. “‘If,’ I exclaim'd, ‘in thy discourteous breast “‘A spark of chivalry or honour rest, “‘Grant me sufficient time, till heav'n once more “‘My vigour and activity restore. “‘Pass but one month, and at Cherontis' gate “‘I will in equal arms thy coming wait.’ “He pledg'd his faith that there he would attend. “Before to-morrow's sun his course shall end, “There to decide our quarrel, must we meet; “And soon, I trust, to thy imperial seat, “Where favour so unmerited I found, “I shall return by fame and vict'ry crown'd.” “Go,” cried the king, “since honour calls thee hence; “May heav'n, brave knight, be arm'd in thy defence! “Farewell—My wishes and my prayers attend “The gallant chieftain whom I call my friend.” He said, and grasp'd his hand. Hyperbius bow'd, And spoke his thanks for the distinction proud: Nor stay'd he, but with chivalrous intent The monarch quitting on his progress went. Meantime, in deepest gloom of thought immers'd, Her heart-corroding grief Zapheria nurs'd, Reflecting still on him, for whom her breast With more than tender pity was impress'd. Slow pass'd the hours; to calm her aching head Meek eve in vain her soothing poppies shed, In vain night's ebon car ascending high Cast solemn stillness o'er the air and sky. What though all nature in oblivion slept? Her melancholy vigil still she kept, Nor, when dawn's tint the glowing east illum'd, And dew-dropt flow'rs the rich parterre perfum'd, More calm her soul became. With sick'ning thought Her oriel's deep recess she sadly sought. “Oh! why,” she cried in tones by grief suppress'd, “Why was my heart with joys so fleeting blest, “Why did I e'er a youth so pleasing view, “Why did I credulously think him true? “My life's gay morning how serene it shew'd! “Its sun with brilliancy unclouded glow'd, “Inticing hope her airy pinions spread, “Around her bright allurements fancy shed, “With heedless confidence I loos'd my sail, “Launch'd my frail bark, and caught the fav'ring gale. “Too simple maid! I guess'd not that a storm “Ocean's smooth surface would so soon deform, “That, ere I reach'd the fondly pictur'd coast, “My happiness for ever would be lost! “Ah! where, alas! art thou, whose counsels sage “The pangs which rack my bosom might assuage, “Where art thou, Theron? Why, when most my soul, “By woe subdued, needs reason's strong controul, “Why dost thou fly me? Is misfortune grown “Contagious, that thou leav'st me thus alone? “Oh come, thou best supporter of my youth! “Come! From the fountain of eternal truth “With mild persuasion to my tortur'd heart “The consolation it requires impart.” As thus she sat in meditation lost, Her mind by visionary cares ingross'd, Alcimedon, whom, though by toil oppress'd, The call of friendship had depriv'd of rest, Arriving found her. From her breast a sigh Still heav'd, a tear still trickled from her eye, Her charms enhancing. Not the early dawn When first it sheds its dew-drops on the lawn, Not the young rose, when in its op'ning fair It scatters fragrance through the ambient air, For loveliness with her or sweetness might compare. “Cheer up,” he gaily cried; “all doubt is o'er, “The storm we dreaded threatens us no more. “No longer as our father's hateful foe, “To fame and honour lost, Perinthus know: “The good Chrysulphus takes him to his breast, “As Aracynthus now he stands confess'd—” “As Aracynthus?” cried she, “could the youth “So suddenly bring witness of his truth? “Alas, my brother! I would fain believe; “But ah! how oft appearances deceive! “I thought him once all perfect—” “Think so still,” Exclaim'd the prince, “and heav'n thy thought fulfil! “Lo! here I bring a witness, who can best “Dispel the doubts which agitate thy breast.” The blushing maid sank trembling on her seat, And Aracynthus knelt enraptur'd at her feet. “The rash intrusion,” he exclaim'd, “forgive “Of him who only in thy sight can live. “Ah lovely princess! from the blissful hour “I saw thee first, my heart confess'd thy pow'r; “Thou wast the cynosure, whose strong controul “Attracted to thyself my constant soul; “To thee, where'er I wander'd, still I turn'd; “With steady flame and lively ardour burn'd; “For thee did I e'en fate impending brave, “Thy willing servitor, thy faithful slave, “Thy Theron—” “Theron!” cried the wond'ring fair, “My Theron thou! His semblance didst thou wear? “Such perils dare for me?”—“To a fond heart “No perils,” he replied, “can fear impart. “At love's suggestion Theron's guise I took, “For thy dear sake the world and fame forsook; “Affection pure as mine requir'd no more: “Content to serve and silently adore, “Each hour, each thought, on thee alone employ'd, “Still had I thus my envied lot enjoy'd, “Had not thy voice with a resistless charm “For thy deserted brother bid me arm—” “Perinthus! Theron! Aracynthus!” cried The maiden, while her cheek deep blushes dyed, “Whate'er thy title, from my grateful heart “Ne'er can th' impression of thy zeal depart. “Alas! what say I?—Pardon me, nor deem “Too strong th' expression of my fix'd esteem: “Still must I think, whate'er thy rank, thy name, “That Mysia's prince and Theron are the same.” “Cherish that thought,” replied th' enraptur'd youth, “From Theron's judge of Aracynthus' truth. “Still shall remain my faithful service thine, “Thy will my law, thy hopes, thy wishes mine: “Whate'er stern duty can exact, whate'er “Can best my love and constancy declare, “Are thine for ever. Deign to think of one, “Who thinks, who feels, who lives for thee alone; “And when, obedient to thy father's will, “In distant climes his mandate I fulfil—” “What means my Theron?” cried th' astonish'd fair, “What new adversity does fate prepare? “Wilt thou then leave us? Say, what can my sire “So suddenly, so cruelly require?” “Bound to thy sire,” replied the youth, “I go “To seek thy lovely sister's direst foe. “Just is the cause; and if thy pious care “For my success shall breathe a tender prayer—” “May gracious Providence,” the fair replied, “Watch o'er thy course, thy gen'rous purpose guide. “Go, Aracynthus! and if fate shall bless “Thine enterprise with merited success, “Zapheria's heart, howe'er her words may fail, “Her sister's champion gratefully will hail. “But if—for who war's chances can foresee— “The pow'rs which rule us should thy fall decree, “Should fate unpitying—” More she would have said, But sighs of anguish her weak voice betray'd. Her bosom heav'd, and, as with blushes burn'd Her glowing cheek, aside her head she turn'd, While the fond youth, who still before her knelt, Could give no utt'rance to the joy he felt, But fix'd upon her his enraptur'd glance. Still they remain'd absorb'd in speechless trance, When Caria's king approach'd. As he survey'd The kneeling chieftain and the timid maid, “I look'd not, prince,” he cried, “to find thee here: “I had some secrets for my daughter's ear, “Of serious import to her peace and heart, “Such as a pious father should impart. “I would have ask'd her if her youthful breast “For Mysia's prince a mutual flame confess'd; “If, when he breath'd his passion at her feet, “Her bosom could with touch responsive beat. “Such was my plan: but useless now such task; “Questions like these I need no longer ask. “Nay, blush not, my lov'd child! Thou need'st not hide “Feelings which well may justify thy pride: “When I in all thy lover's hopes concur, “Let not false shame his promis'd joys defer. “Speak, or, since silence may perhaps as well “To his fond heart thine acquiescence tell, “Give him some token, that at once my will “And his warm hopes thou wilt ere long fulfil.” As thus he spoke, a deeper tinge of red Her varying cheek and throbbing breast o'erspread: At length her eyes she rais'd, and smiling cried, “A parent should a daughter's fate decide. “Witness, just heav'n! ye pow'rs immortal hear, “And register on high my words sincere! “Thus from my soul, and in your awful sight, “My duty and affection I unite; “Thus freely I obey my sire's command— “Take, Aracynthus, take my willing hand!” To ecstacy which mock'd expression wrought, Kneeling th' inestimable pledge he caught, On which, beyond all expectation blest, A thousand burning kisses he impress'd, While Caria's king implor'd the pow'rs above To bless and ratify their mutual love. At length with interrupted voice he cried, “Can I a pair whom heav'n unites divide? “No, prince, I will not agonize thine heart, “Or bid thee from thy lov'd Zapheria part. “Let me absolve thee from thy vow; may joy “Henceforth alone thy raptur'd soul employ.” He said. The prince stood wrapt in warring thought, Till from Zapheria's eye a glance he caught, Which to his conscious soul whole volumes spoke, And all its gen'rous energies awoke. Sudden, across his countenance there beam'd A ray divine which more than mortal seem'd: “No hero he from duty who can swerve,” He cried, “no recreant can this hand deserve. “Have I not pledg'd my faith? Though partial fame “Beyond my merits may have grac'd my name, “Much still is wanting ere with fair renown “Her hand unerring shall my labours crown. “Tempt me not then, by an attractive hope “Of bliss so far transcending fancy's scope, “To leave that glorious enterprise untried, “Which int'rests so important must decide.” “Enough! let honour's dictates be obey'd,” Him interrupting, cried the weeping maid. “Go—and where'er thy daring course may tend, “On thy Zapheria's constancy depend.” “Ye nobly have resolv'd,” Chrysulphus said. “Now mark this scroll, mysteriously convey'd “Into my chamber by some means unknown, “Devoid of signature, and these alone “Its brief contents—‘Would Aracynthus meet “‘The Dragon Knight, let him repair to Crete.’” “Come whence it may,” the gallant youth replied, “To Crete my instant progress it shall guide.” “'Tis well,” the monarch said; “a well arm'd band “And a brave bark shall wait on thy command.” “No! let me rather,” cried the ardent prince, “Singly my zeal and loyalty evince. “'Tis not against an order'd host I go; “I seek the Dragon Knight, a single foe. “Him to confront I hasten. In this port, “Where from each clime unnumber'd barks resort, “A ready vessel I shall quickly find, “Then trust my course to fortune and the wind. “And now, sweet maid, while from thy presence driv'n, “I trust thee to the watchful care of heav'n: “That hand unseen, which will my course direct, “Thy purity will foster and protect; “And when, fulfill'd my task, again we meet, “With a fond smile thy Aracynthus greet.” Sighing he spoke. Again he fondly press'd The not reluctant fair one to his breast; Then with the king, whose moisten'd eye bespoke A father's fondness, from the chamber broke. To Mysia's king, meantime, absorb'd in grief, Nor rest nor solitude could bring relief. Vainly for him the royal couch was spread; O'er him no slumbers their mild influence shed, His aching temples throbb'd, with quicken'd flood Rush'd through each art'ry his distemper'd blood. “Alas!” as starting from his couch he cried, “Sleep is to pangs acute as mine denied. “Why was I tempted to renew my pain, “To visit this forbidden spot again? “'Tis time to terminate a feud, where love, “Spite of myself, must still victorious prove. “Give me mine arms! Bring forth my vig'rous steed! “It matters not where fate my steps may lead— “But thus to fly from her—not once to gaze “On the dear tyrant of my wretched days, “Not once again to deprecate her hate, “And at her feet deplore my alter'd fate—” With that his pen he seiz'd, and thus in haste With trembling hand his heart's effusion trac'd. “Think not so soon forgot thy stern reply— “Thou bad'st me, cruel! from thy presence fly— “Not for a moment my torn heart rebell'd— “A brother's life my quick return compell'd. “Wilt thou obdurate still my vows refuse, “And close thine ear when Orosmanes sues? “Let pity touch thee—my bold suit forgive— “Let me not banish'd from thy presence live. “Submissively thy mandate I await, “Thy will my law, and thy behest my fate!” The scroll he sent: and now his lab'ring thought Unnumber'd doubts and apprehensions wrought, When, as if sent to calm his inward flame And sooth his anguish, Aracynthus came. Long time with mutual pleasure they convers'd, Their loves, their deeds, their suff'rings past rehears'd, Till Orosmanes with emotion cried, “Ere envious destiny again divide “Our too long sever'd fortunes, I would know “If 'tis to thee my rescued realm I owe: “For rumour, though she sounded not thy name, “Afar hath spread the valour and the fame “Of a brave youth, whose deeds of high renown “My cause asserted and maintain'd my crown.” “Rumour,” he answer'd, “oft in fiction bold, “Her tale in this respect hath truly told. “There was a youthful knight of high desert, “In council sage, in feats of arms alert, “Who, ere the shores of Mysia I regain'd, “Thy royal rights successfully maintain'd. “A gallant youth he was, but whence he drew “His birth, or what his title was, none knew; “For though, ere yet the rebel cause prevail'd, “And impious force the monarchy assail'd, “He had resided at the Mysian court, “Fated, alas! to need his strong support, “He frankly own'd that to the borrow'd name, “Pisander, which he bore, he had no claim, “And that, till some brave chieftain he should meet, “Whose name or titles he would ne'er repeat, “Nothing should make him of his lineage speak, “Or his firm vow of strict concealment break. “Him as the guardian of thy state I hail'd, “Nor to assist his strenuous efforts fail'd. “Unknown by all, and with unblazon'd shield, “Which nought descriptive of my rank reveal'd, “With him tow'rds Adramyttium's walls I drew. “Each day more numerous our associates grew; “We fought, we conquer'd. To that youth alone “Art thou indebted for thy rescu'd throne.” “My sceptre,” said the king, “to both I owe; “Let me on both my grateful thanks bestow. “But tell me now why in Bithynia's court “Thy sojourn prov'd so hateful and so short. “Its numberless attractions fame recites, “Its varied pleasures and its gay delights, “And, what most ornaments the splendid scene, “Fair Iphimedia, its attractive queen. “To thee, my brother, and to thee alone “Would I,” replied the prince, “the reason own. “Still sacred let it in thy breast remain; “And stamp me not with a repute so vain, “As his must be, who blasts a woman's fame, “Reveals her weakness and records her shame. “Surpassing all the fair I then had seen “To my rapt sight appear'd Bithynia's queen: “Adorn'd with ev'ry beauty was her face, “Her form was modell'd by the hand of grace, “In ev'ry look, in ev'ry dimpled smile, “Love spread a snare his vot'ries to beguile, “In ev'ry tone such fascination dwelt, “Its soul-subduing potency all felt; “She seem'd a casket, which might hold a gem, “Worthy to grace a princely diadem, “Yet, like Pandora's box, whence flew dispers'd “All the dire mischiefs which mankind have curs'd, “Her fair exterior held a soul debas'd “By ev'ry fault which womanhood disgrac'd. “Of each fell passion which distracts the soul “By turns she felt the dominant controul, “Lust, hatred, vengeance, pride, contempt of all “That moves to good, or conscience can appal: “Inconstant, changeful as the veering wind, “Now courting one, now to another kind, “Disdainful of her matrimonial tie, “And still unsated with variety, “As chance or phantasy her choice might lead, “Each day successive lovers saw succeed, “Now to her couch capriciously preferr'd, “Now left to mingle with the common herd. “Such Iphimedia was.—Why must I tell “How soon she gave me cause to know her well? “For me, her husband's unsuspecting guest, “A loose and guilty passion she confess'd, “To captivate my sense detail'd her charms, “And courted me to her adult'rous arms. “Foil'd in her impious plan, with murd'rous thought “On my attendant Alcimus she wrought. “With fatal juice from deadliest plants distill'd, “A goblet destin'd for my lips she fill'd: “But heav'n preserv'd me from her vengeful hate; “He drain'd the goblet, and his draught was fate.” He ended. Both remain'd absorb'd in thought, When to the king address'd a scroll was brought. Quickly he op'd it, and with troubled air Thus read the mandate of his sov'reign fair. “Of him, who still of his obedience speaks, “While her injunction he so freely breaks, “Of Orosmanes, if to stay he choose, “May Chariclea the request refuse? “She hath no pow'r to banish from his sight “The guests her royal father may invite; “Yet, though in this submissive to his will, “Of her own thoughts she is the mistress still.” “'Tis well, proud beauty!” Orosmanes cried, “Treat me with scorn, insult me with thy pride! “Thou know'st I still must love thee, that my soul “Must still endure thy tyrannous controul. “O Aracynthus! thou hast ne'er sustain'd “Suff'rings like those by which my heart is pain'd: “To crown thy high deserts, propitious heav'n “A less obdurate fair hath kindly giv'n, “One who responsive to thy suit will prove, “Thy merits recognise, and share thy love.” Thus spoke the king, nor had he time for more, For now return'd Hermantes from the shore, And briefly told them he a bark had found, Prepar'd to sail, for Crete directly bound. And now the prince, disdaining all delay, With Orosmanes took his eager way To the throng'd harbour, where far off they spied A vessel anchor'd by the river's side; An eagle grac'd its prow, each ample sail Already stretch'd, was quiv'ring in the gale. The brothers took a last and fond embrace, Affection's tear bedew'd each manly face: Slowly the Mysian king retrac'd the strand, While Aracynthus wav'd his parting hand. CANTO VIII. A day had pass'd, since from Larissa's shore The gallant vessel Aracynthus bore. When dawn'd the second, reckless of repose, From her unhonour'd couch Zapheria rose, And, her sad soul absorb'd in mournful thought, The chamber of her lov'd Aspasia sought. Vain prov'd her hope; no sister there she found, But solitude and silence reign'd around. Rent were the curtains which adorn'd the bed, The lamp was overthrown, the oil was shed, The door, which through the garden to a wood That tow'rds the river trended, open stood: On the smooth grass, where unexhal'd the dew Caught from the sun each gay prismatic hue, Footsteps confus'd were trac'd, the lawn which cross'd, Till in the wood's recesses they were lost. Too much she saw, the rest too well she guess'd: With trembling limbs and palpitating breast Straight to the palace of her sire she hied, And pale and panting with emotion cried, “She's gone! she's lost! by treach'rous arts betray'd, “Aspasia from her chamber is convey'd!” As when the sun with cloudless splendour reigns, And sheds abundance o'er Sicilia's plains, If suddenly from Ætna's heaving side With crash horrific burst a flaming tide, Catania tott'ring waits her fatal doom, Once her proud nobles' seat, but now their tomb: Such was th' effect which on the king was wrought. Aspasia's chamber instantly he sought, Where full and dread conviction of the whole Rush'd at a glance o'er his distracted soul. The rumour quickly through the palace flew; Princes and knights and noble dames it drew, And straight with promises of rich reward On ev'ry side was sent the ready guard, And ev'ry gallant chief with instant speed, Bad his esquires prepare his arms and steed. While, as reclining on her father's breast, With streaming eyes, in accents half suppress'd Zapheria mourn'd her sister's dire mischance, Tow'rds the throng'd gate a knight was seen advance With quicken'd pace through the surrounding crowd, Who, hailing him with acclamations loud, Gave way, as on he came with eager air. In his right hand he led a damsel fair, Whose feeble limbs with agitation shook, While her torn garments, her distracted look, And locks dishevell'd gave assurance strong Of recent violence and ruffian wrong. “As here,” he cried, “across the neighb'ring wood “At early dawn my travel I pursued, “Loud shrieks I heard, which from a thicket close, “Adjoining to the river, frequent rose. “Alarm'd, my steed without delay I turn'd, “When lo! this hapless damsel I discern'd, “Bound to a tree which near the current stood—” Up-starting, when the maid Zapheria view'd, “Tell me, Perissa!” cried she, “whose stern hand “Thus wrought a deed by hellish malice plann'd?” “Oh! ask me not,” she fearfully replied, “Let me the dreadful truth for ever hide. “How can such shock thy tender nature bear? “How can I speak it, or how can'st thou hear? “'Twas by the Dragon Knight the deed was done— “He, he and Aracynthus' self are one!” “'Tis false!” th' indignant Orosmanes cried, “Most false! My noble brother is belied. “In fair Aspasia's cause, in her defence, “Far have the waves of ocean borne him hence. “I saw him mount the bark; a fav'ring gale “Strain'd ev'ry cord and stretch'd each bulging sail: “His parting words, when bidding me adieu, “Prov'd him to honour and Zapheria true. “Give o'er to load him with reproach so base, “Nor dare an absent hero's name disgrace!” “Forbid it, heav'n!” replied she; “what befel, “As truly I have witness'd, will I tell. “While night yet veil'd the sky, and all around “In deepest silence and repose was bound, “A lamp's dim splendour glaring on my eyes “Awoke me suddenly. Judge my surprise, “When an arm'd warrior near my couch I view'd. “Seizing upon me with aggression rude, “‘Few moments,’ he exclaim'd, ‘can I afford: “‘Cast on thy garments, and obey my word!’ “My girdle then, which near me he espied, “Across my mouth with hasty hand he tied. “While trembling his injunction I obey'd, “Heriphila my comrade I survey'd, “Bound as myself. They hurried us away “To the next chamber where the princess lay. “Heav'ns! what a scene of horror struck mine eyes! “Loose was her robe, her zone suppress'd her cries, “Her hair dishevell'd on her shoulders hung, “To the supporters of her bed she clung; “But vain her feeble efforts—through the door “Their vainly struggling prey the ruffians bore. “Soon reach'd they the recesses of the wood. “These swiftly passing, they approach'd the flood, “Where, by an anchor riding, at its side “With sails unfurl'd a vessel we espied. “Its deck was fill'd with men in arms array'd; “On its high prow an eagle was display'd—” “An eagle,” cried the Mysian king aghast, “Is doubt to damning certainty then past? “But hold—It may be the uncertain light “And thick obscuring mists deceiv'd thy sight.” “Ah no!” she answer'd, “though obscur'd the sky, “An eagle's form too plainly struck mine eye. “'Twas not a glance, as soon as taken o'er: “Long time I gaz'd upon it from the shore: “For as the crew with violence abhorr'd “The princess and my comrade forc'd on board, “While on the strand I stood with dread aghast, “From him his dragon shield the caitiff cast, “And seizing with a felon grasp on me, “With his own scarf he bound me to a tree.” “This very scarf, which bound the injur'd fair,” Exclaim'd the knight, “lo! in my hand I bear.” “Give me to view it,” sad Zapheria cried. Scarcely with hasty glance the scarf she ey'd, When from her hand she dropt it. Down her cheek Trickled a tear: she sigh'd, but could not speak: To heav'n she rais'd a supplicating look, And with a fault'ring step the room forsook. While all around were lost in anxious thought, Alcimedon the scarf mysterious caught. “How can his guilt,” said he, “from this appear? “This scarf did ever Aracynthus wear?” “Too surely was it his,” Perissa said, “Zapheria's hand the rich embroid'ry made. “Amid those rose and jasmin wreaths, behold “Her cypher wrought in characters of gold; “And see too, interwoven, this device— “Zapheria's gift let faithful Theron prize!” “Alas!” Chrysulphus cried, “what need of more? “Too plain thine evidence! All doubt is o'er. “Yet tell me, ere thy sad recital close, “Where was my daughter carried by her foes? “'Twill prove some mitigation of my pain, “Should of revenge one cheering hope remain.” “As round my limbs,” said she, “that scarf he tied, “The cruel prince with voice insulting cried, “‘Here, till some passenger relieve thee, stay, “‘While I thy lovely princess bear away. “‘Let thy convincing evidence proclaim “‘My triumph and the Carian monarch's shame. “‘Tell weak Zapheria, that another spouse “‘Shall soon receive her destin'd husband's vows. “‘If Caria's cred'lous monarch should demand “‘Who bore his daughter from Mæonia's strand, “‘Say, and no doubt the favour he'll requite, “‘'Twas the achievment of the Dragon Knight; “‘And add, that if he would his daughter greet, “‘He may set forth and follow her to Crete.’” “Remorseless ruffian!” cried Chrysulphus, “yes! “I'll meet thee, and exact severe redress. “Away! with speed a warlike bark prepare— “You, gallant knights, my enterprise shall share—” “Not so,” exclaim'd his son; “to years more fit “The task of wreaking thy revenge commit. “Thy age and dignity require repose; “Give me thy license to pursue thy foes, “Entrust to me thy bark, thy warlike band, “And delegate thy vengeance to my hand.” As thus he spoke, the Mysian king arose. “My friend,” he cried, “if thou canst trust repose “In me, the brother of the youth whose name, “O thought revolting! now seems lost to fame, “Let me, I pray, my zealous aid combine, “And in pursuit of thy just vengeance join. “My brother! no! if true the charge shall prove, “I cast him off, forget all kin, all love. “Could I believe that in my vital flood “Lurk'd but a drop of such degen'rate blood, “By heav'n my sword should open ev'ry vein, “And to its dregs the foul pollution drain!” “'Tis bravely said,” the Carian king replied; “To your joint charge my int'rests I confide.” And now the guard returning notice gave The bark was ready with its escort brave. The youthful pair, with gen'rous ardour fir'd, For their departure little time requir'd: Soon were their limbs in fitting arms encas'd; The sorrowing king they tenderly embrac'd, And to the port with hasty footsteps went, Where lay the warlike bark, its sails unbent. Impatient to be gone, with vig'rous spring Leapt on its crowded deck the Mysian king; But, ere Alcimedon could mount its side, In haste arriv'd a knight, who loudly cried, “Stay, gen'rous prince! do not my suit refuse— “It is Bythynia's king, Artaces, sues. “Oh! by each hope that's dearest to thy heart, “Give me to bear in thy emprise a part!” “Though for thy proffer,” Caria's prince replied, “My thanks, Artaces, may not be denied, “Yet, had Aspasia's cause requir'd a friend, “There are enough who would their succour lend, “Without resorting to the aid of those “Class'd in the number of her direst foes.” “Had any but thyself,” replied the king, “Dar'd such unfounded accusation bring, “My sword had answer'd him. But thou'rt secure. “I love thy sister, and thy taunts endure. “Think as thou wilt of me; but, for her sake, “Oh let me in thy gen'rous toils partake!” He said, and vaulted on the deck; nor stay'd The Carian prince. High on their mast display'd The swelling canvas caught the fav'ring wind, And soon they left Mæonia's shore behind. Meantime, arriving at Prothenor's gate, Appear'd an Envoy from Armenia's state, An audience craving. Soon in arms array'd A gallant chieftain his obeisance made, And thus the king bespoke. “From him, whose sway “Armenia and its subject realms obey, “The presence of Mæonia's king I seek, “And thus the purport of my mission speak. “Since heav'n, for some wise purposes unknown, “Hath of an heir depriv'd th' Armenian throne— “For, when his princely son Tigranes died, “Nor child nor brother his wept loss supplied— “My royal master, fearful of the fate “Which may his realms from anarchy await “And civil broils, if, when his reign shall end, “Opposing factions shall for sway contend, “Held frequent council. After long debate, “The final reference was left to fate. “Among the volumes, fill'd with truth sublime “By learned sages in remoter time, “For mystic learning and research profound “One far beyond all others was renown'd. “'Twas written by Zorastes' sacred hand, “When Magian doctrines overspread the land: “By it events far distant were foretold; “The web of dark futurity unroll'd “Perspicuous grew, as when the solar ray “Bursts from the east and heralds on the day. “This volume, long conceal'd from mortal view, “Our Monarch from his secret archives drew, “And, as with cautious hand he op'd the page, “This mystic sentence did his eye engage— “‘When from the trunk of the imperial oak “‘Its last and solitary branch is broke, “‘Its fall immediate wouldst thou then avert, “‘A scion from a royal stock insert. “‘Mæonia lends a bark—As fav'ring heav'n “‘Directs, o'er ocean's surface it is driv'n— “‘To one, alone amid a murd'rous band, “‘Points an expiring female's blood-stain'd hand— “‘The royal mantle o'er his limbs is spread— “‘The regal diadem adorns his head— “‘The best, the bravest of mankind alone “‘By fate's decree shall fill Armenia's throne!’— “As, though this oracle in gloom was wrapt, “It seem'd not to our present state unapt, “To me, Araspes, who distinguish'd stand “Among the satraps of his chosen band, “Our monarch gave commission to this coast, “Obeying fate's high will, to lead a host, “And, as a pledge of friendship, from thy hand “A fitting bark for war equipp'd demand.” “'Tis granted,” said the king. “Of ample size “A bark of war within our harbour lies. “Yet grant me first, brave Sir, a brief delay; “Within our court awhile I pray thee stay.” “My orders are precise,” replied the knight, “My royal master's will I dare not slight. “Our brief refreshment o'er, I and my train “Must o'er the waves our course pursue again.” No more the king oppos'd his firm intent, But, by the gallant troop attended, went To the wide banquet hall, where amply stor'd With various cates was seen the royal board. Bidding all welcome, to the brim he fill'd A cup with juice from Naxian grapes distill'd, And, as he rais'd it, breath'd an ardent pray'r That heav'n would guide them with protecting care. They pledg'd him willingly, and for a while In social mirth forgot their destin'd toil, Till bold Araspes, rising from his seat, With hand out-stretch'd gave signal of retreat. In courteous guise, and words which well express'd The grateful sentiments which fill'd his breast, He left the hall, and with new hope elate Prepar'd to execute the will of fate. Close by the quay the stately bark appear'd, Its jovial mariners the warriors cheer'd; Each gen'rous knight with new-born ardour glow'd, As o'er the buoyant waves the vessel rode. Down Hermus' stream a steady eastern gale, Guiding their rapid progress, fill'd each sail, And, when arriv'd at its capacious mouth, With change immediate veering to the south, Their vessel tow'rds the Lesbian isle propell'd. Their useless helm no practis'd pilot held: Drifting mid rocks and shoals, the steady crew Beheld their bark its destin'd course pursue, Prepar'd to meet whatever might betide, Heav'n their protector, and its hand their guide. And now Phocæa they had left behind, When, by a force inscrutable, the wind At once to the opposing quarter flew, And from the north with course unvarying blew. Between the Chian and Mæonian shore Swiftly the still unguided bark it bore, When, straight before them, with appalling fear They saw Icaria's lawless isle appear. 'Twas on the fifth sad eve, when tow'rds the west The sun declining tended to his rest, That, ruminating on her luckless fate, Zapheria in her spacious oriel sat. Before it Hermes his vast waters roll'd, Glitt'ring with varied tints of brightest gold, Down which, obedient to the fav'ring tide, As she beheld successive vessels glide, Her tortur'd mind dread recollections cross'd Of those it lately bore, now haply lost. Nor fair Lycoris, nor Hermilia mild From contemplation sad her heart beguil'd; Nor Chariclea, though her strenuous soul Its own propensities could well controul, Avail'd to chase reflections, which each hour From disappointment seem'd to gain fresh pow'r. For when could argument alleviate grief; When dry reflection minister relief; Ah! when could reason's cold persuasion move The heart where rankles disappointed love! Still, persevering in their pious care, To the mute suff'ring maid they urg'd their pray'r, Who with fix'd eyes, as in a waking dream, Intently gaz'd upon the distant stream, Till suddenly with hurried voice she cried, “See you yon bark advancing 'gainst the tide? “As if impell'd by some resistless force, “Spite of all obstacles it holds its course. “Now to the harbour rapidly it steers— “True to my hopes, Mæonia's flag it bears! “Is't not the same, which lately from our shore “Alcimedon and Orosmanes bore?” “Nor of thy brother,” Chariclea cried, “Nor of Aspasia will this bark decide. “I recognise it well, It is the same “In which the knight, who from Armenia came, “Embark'd to make research for one unknown, “Whom fate mysterious doom'd to fill its throne.” Zapheria heard, and heav'd a tender sigh. Meantime approach'd the lordly vessel nigh. “See, on the crowded deck,” Hermilia said, “How gallant an assemblage is display'd. “Ne'er did my eyes behold so gay a band. “Lo! an arm'd chieftain leaps upon the strand— “Would I could see if correspond his face “With his exterior dignity and grace.” “And do ye not,” Lycoris cried, “behold “How glitters in the sun his robe of gold? “The diadem, which on his brow he wears, “Doubtless the new Armenian king declares. “But to the vessel why does he return?” “Upon the deck a lady I discern,” Said Chariclea. “Now with courteous hand “He aids her to descend upon the strand. “What numbers, forming their illustrious train, “Now crowd upon the quay! And see again “Two warriors following, who with careful heed “A captive knight in bonds between them lead; “And mark those mariners who next appear— “A lifeless female in their arms they bear.” “The oracle,” Hermilia said, “foretold “A dying woman should their fate unfold. “Now tow'rds the palace they their course pursue— “But ah! yon buildings intercept our view, “And hide the gay procession from our eyes. “Hark! what a shout that seems to rend the skies! “Again another rises yet more loud! “And see where hither rushes on a crowd—” As thus she spoke, with agitated air A damsel enter'd. “Heav'n hath heard our pray'r,” She cried. “Aspasia, safe from all alarms, “Once more reposes in her father's arms!” “Immortal pow'rs be thank'd!” Zapheria cried, “Now a brief moment must my fate decide.” Thus saying, from the door with hasty tread Through the long gall'ries rapidly she sped. When at the audience hall arriv'd, its gate, The sole, precarious barrier of her fate, As with a trembling hand she open threw, To her embrace her lov'd Aspasia flew. Awhile o'ercome by joy's transporting flood, In silent ecstacy the sisters stood, When suddenly the youthful knight, whose brow The crown adorn'd, advanc'd, and bending low, While with respect Zapheria's hand he took, “Ah deign,” cried he, “on Aracynthus look!” Not when the son of Danaë display'd The sever'd head of the Gorgonian maid, With such dismay were fill'd his threat'ning foes, As that which in Zapheria's breast arose. She snatch'd away her hand. “Begone! away! “Hence! to some other adulation pay! “Thou, thou, the Dragon Knight! Aspasia's foe! “Traitor to love, the cause of all my woe!” “What means this sudden change?” replied the youth. “What makes thee doubt thy Aracynthus' truth? “By all my hopes, by thy fair self I vow, “That, as I lov'd thee first, so love I truly now.” “Ah! term him not,” Aspasia cried, “my foe. “To him alone my life, my fame, I owe. “His nobleness, his constancy believe. “Oh do not my preserver thus receive!” “If I have seem'd to thy desert unjust, “Strong circumstance occasion'd my distrust,” Zapheria answer'd. “Think of it no more— “Let me forgiveness for my fault implore. “Receive my proffer'd hand. To worth like thine “That and my heart I willingly resign, “Thine, only thine, for ever! Had I thought “That thou my love unworthily had'st sought, “No rank, no pow'r, how vast soe'er its range, “In my decision could have wrought a change. “No—in the sentiments which rule my heart “Such sordid feelings never bore a part. “Had fortune, which thy high desert hath crown'd, “Capriciously on all thy efforts frown'd, “Had she pursued thee with her wildest hate, “Zapheria's love, unchangeable as fate, “Amid the storm had still remain'd unmov'd, “To thee her heart had ever faithful prov'd.” As thus she spoke, transported to his breast The blushing fair one Aracynthus press'd. When the first ecstacies of joy were past, Chrysulphus on the youth a kind glance cast. “May heav'n!” exclaim'd he, “bless this happy hour, “And on your heads its sweetest influence show'r! “But now of graver matters must we treat. “How, where did'st thou my wrong'd Aspasia meet? “Tell me, brave Aracynthus, who were they “Whose ruffian force my daughter bore away?” “So strange,” he answer'd, “would the story seem, “Thou scarcely would'st my words authentic deem. “Bring forth the Dragon Knight! Let him appear, “And from his injur'd king his sentence hear. With that his hand he wav'd. Ope flew the gate: A warlike band advanc'd in order'd state; On either side the spacious hall they drew, And lo! Hyperbius was revealed to view. His scowling glance was fix'd upon the ground; Sullen awhile he stood; then gazing round With look of horror, trembling and aghast Before Chrysulphus' throne himself he cast, And, streaming with a flood of tears his eyes, His utt'rance broken by convulsive sighs, While to the ground he lowly bow'd his head, Thus to the monarch earnestly he said. “Condemn, but pity me! I ask no more, “No farther dare I clemency implore. “Lost as I am to all that life can give, “I cannot—no! I cannot wish to live. “Lead me to death. It cannot come too soon: “'Tis my sole hope; I ask it as a boon. “Yet should thy mercy—For who knows so well “How mercy doth all attributes excel— “If it should doom me still to future time “To live a wretched monument of crime, “To linger out my days in shame and woe, “Victim of ev'ry pang despair can know, “Could I from thy benign behest appeal? “Ah would, ere cruel fate had made me feel “The bitter agony, the tort'ring smart, “Which deep remorse inflicts upon my heart, “Heav'n's blast had struck me! But all words are weak; “What language can sincere contrition speak? “Give me short space—Oh! do not drive me hence “To my account, while rank is my offence, “Before repentance for a deed so foul “Hath purg'd my fault and purified my soul!” “Urge me no more,” th' indignant monarch cried, “Impartial justice shall thy fate decide. “Poor abject wretch! who can'st so lowly aim “To court existence stigmatis'd by shame, “I will not thy disgusting treasons state, “Or aggravate the horrors of thy fate. “Thy guilt is manifest. Lead him away! “His death the forfeit of his crimes must pay.” “If,” he replied. “I may no longer live, “Some few brief moments for repentance give. “Think what death is—Oh! think what dreadful doom “Awaits the sinful wretch beyond the tomb— “Eternal pangs, the worm that ne'er can die, “Torments co-equal with eternity! “Think, think of this! and, if soft pity can “Work on thy heart, remember I'm a man, “A being like thyself, to whom high heav'n “A soul immortal as thine own hath giv'n. “As thou do'st hope for pardon, give me time “To ask from heav'n forgiveness of my crime; “Let me that mercy seek, which from mankind, “Abhorrent of my guilt, I may not find. “Then shall my parting spirit bless thy name, “And in a world unknown thy clemency proclaim.” “Though nought,” said Caria's king, “thy life may save, “My vengeance goes no farther than the grave. “Thou may'st this night employ in fervent pray'r “That thy polluted soul high heav'n would spare; “Make full confession to some holy priest; “From thy dread load of sin by him releas'd, “May'st thou with better hope resign thy breath, “And expiate in this world thy crimes by death. “Thou know'st thy fate—I list not to reply. “Hence with him, guards! Observe him heedfully.” Shudd'ring Hyperbius heard. The guard obey'd, And to his dungeon the pale wretch convey'd. “Now,” said Chrysulphus, “this sad duty o'er, “Delay the promis'd narrative no more. “Though known the miscreant who these treasons wrought, “How he achiev'd them I would yet be taught.” “Mine be that task,” the fair Aspasia cried; “My guardian's modesty the truth might hide, “And o'er his gallant actions cast a veil. “List then with patience to th' eventful tale.” CANTO IX. “When from my chamber I was rudely torn, “And to the bark by ruffian force was borne, “To a lone cabin, far remote from all “To whom might reach my supplicating call, “Was I convey'd; Heriphila alone “Remain'd to witness my despairing moan. “Straight was the anchor heav'd; each outspread sail “Felt the strong impulse of the fav'ring gale; “O'er the smooth bosom of the deep we flew, “And soon Mæonia vanish'd from our view. “'Cross the wide waters as I cast mine eye, “Oft from my anguish'd bosom stole a sigh, “And oft I call'd, with expectation vain, “On the dear friends unconscious of my pain. “While thus, tho' suff'ring much, yet more I fear'd, “Sudden, with vizor rais'd, a knight appear'd. “I look'd not on him, but with wild affright “Exclaim'd, ‘Hence, ruffian, nor pollute my sight!’ “‘Bear I,’ said he, ‘contagion in my look, “‘That even my approach thou can'st not brook? “‘Turn not away; bestow a kind regard “‘On one who well such favours can reward.’ “His voice familiar seem'd. My head I turn'd, “When with delight Hyperbius I discern'd. “‘Hath gracious heav'n,’ exclaimed I, ‘sent a friend, “‘Whose blest assistance may my mis'ries end?’ “‘As such regard me,’ smiling he replied; “‘For I alone thy fortunes can decide. “‘Grant me a hearing, princess: what I say “‘Thy short attention amply will repay. “‘Know—for concealment now no more I need, “‘But glory in the bold successful deed— “‘'Twas I who seiz'd, and from Mæonia's shore “‘Triumphantly my lovely captive bore. “‘Complete and perfect is my great design; “‘I hold thee safely, fair one!

Dar'st thou now “‘Swerve from thy compact, falsify thy vow? “‘Did'st thou not, traitor! by thine honour swear “‘Thou would'st my princess to Bithynia bear?’ “‘Proceed,’ he coolly answer'd. ‘Thou may'st, rail; “‘But think'st thou clamour will on me prevail? “‘Away! nor trouble us.—Come, lady fair, “‘Pronounce—Wilt thou Bithynia's sceptre share?— “‘What means this silence—that averted eye? “‘Am I then deem'd unworthy of reply? “‘I caution thee. Should'st thou my suit reject, “‘Look to thyself. What fate thou may'st expect “‘Need I suggest?

Tremble and depart, “‘Ere its point drain the life-blood from thy heart— “‘Stay'st thou, regardless of my high command? “‘Take then the fate thou courtest from my hand!’ “‘To arrest the blow upon his arm I hung: “‘But me far off with violence he flung, “‘And following her, who from the cabin fled, “‘And tow'rds the deck with rapid footsteps sped, “His ruthless dagger planted in her side. “From the deep wound distill'd a crimson'd tide: “Shrieking she fell. Forth from the door I rush'd, “And, when I saw the sanguine stream which gush'd “From the poor suff'ring wretch, amid the crew, “By frantic desperation urg'd, I flew: “But 'mongst them vainly I protection sought. “Hyperbius follow'd: as my arm he caught, “‘Think'st thou to 'scape me thus?’ he fiercely cried, “Is this fit conduct for Hyperbius' bride? “‘Behold at hand Icaria's welcome isle—’ “‘Hence!’ franticly I cried, ‘assassin vile! “‘Plunge in my heart that instrument of death, “‘Save me from thee, and with my parting breath “‘I'll call on heav'n its dispensations dread “‘To heap with tenfold vengeance on thy head!’ “‘Nay then,’ said he, ‘if soft persuasion fail, “‘'Tis time to see if force may not prevail. “‘Useless are all thy pray'rs, thy tears, thy cries; “‘Thus in mine arms I seize thee as my prize!’ “In vain I struggled to escape his grasp; “But close he held me in his savage clasp, “And bore me 'cross the deck, while louder still “Arose my wild lament and outcries shrill, “When, like an angel sent from heav'n in aid “Of injur'd innocence, in arms array'd “Brave Aracynthus, rising from below, “Check'd the swift progress of my cruel foe. “The ruffian loos'd his hold, and, as he ey'd “The gallant youth, in taunting accents cried, “‘What dost thou here? Would I thy life had ta'en, “‘Nor giv'n thee respite, in expectance vain “‘That, to Icaria come, my good allies “‘A princely captive like thyself might prize. “‘As 'tis, thy fate too long delay'd receive. “‘Fall on, my friends, the glorious work achieve!’ “As thus he spoke, the prince with look amaz'd “Now upon me, now on Hyperbius gaz'd: “At last, indignant, with an out-stretch'd hand “And air demonstrative of high command, “He check'd the Saracens who forward press'd, “And thus the leader of their host address'd. “‘Now I perceive with what accurs'd intent “‘That artful scroll to Caria's king was sent. “‘But vain thy trait'rous plan: high heav'n mine arm “‘Will guide this lady to protect from harm.’ “Then turning hastily to me he cried, “‘Take shelter, princess, by Hermantes' side; “‘While 'gainst this wretch thine honour I defend, “‘Securely on my tried esquire depend.’ “Scarce had he ended, when the felon crew “'Gainst him a show'r of missile weapons threw, “Then rush'd upon him, like a hungry pack “Of eager hounds who some tall stag attack; “He boldly fronts, and to the ground o'erthrows “The first and keenest of his daring foes, “While trembling at his fury, in their rear “The huntsman cheering stands, nor ventures near: “So stood aloof Hyperbius, and aloud “Utter'd high vauntings and defiance proud, “So the fierce Saracens the prince beset, “So he undaunted their encounter met. “Of them, as on they press'd in crowded rank, “Beneath his trenchant blade the foremost shrank. “Each moment more intensely rag'd the fray; “On the red deck some dead, some dying, lay; “Discord on high her bloody pinions pois'd, “And death in his augmenting feast rejoic'd, “When, as across the sea mine eyes I cast, “I saw a lordly bark approaching fast. “By a brisk gale unceasingly impell'd, “Directly tow'rds us its swift course it held. “Heriphila, whom now no fears could check, “Advancing feebly tow'rds me 'cross the deck, “While trickled fast her blood, sank at my side. “‘Thank heav'n, there's aid at hand!’ she faintly cried, “‘Let us the succour which it sends implore.’ “She said, and wav'd her veil distain'd with gore. “Straight from the strangers burst an outcry loud; “More swiftly than before their bark the ocean plough'd. “Meantime increas'd the fury of the foe; “Nor was the prince to meet their rage more slow: “When the strange bark, whose ev'ry full-stretch'd sail “Confess'd the influence of the fav'ring gale, “Alongside came. Heriphila again “Wav'd high her crimson'd veil, nor wav'd in vain. “From the tall prow a gallant chieftain cried, “‘That blood-stain'd hand our fortunes must decide! “‘Lady, from thee to learn our country's doom, “‘Hither, with high commission charg'd we come.’ “‘Then, then,’ exulting cried she, ‘may we find, “‘Aid for the best and bravest of mankind!’ “Another shout, yet louder than the first, “From the whole host of stranger warriors burst. “‘Directress of our fate!’ the chief replied, “‘Our longing eyes to him thou speak'st of guide.’ “‘Behold!’ she cried, stretching her blood-stain'd hand, “‘He stands oppos'd to yonder murd'rous band.’ “‘Accomplish'd be heav'n's will,’ exclaim'd the chief, “‘On, brave companions, on to his relief!’ “Close grappling, on the deck they quickly leapt, “And soon the ruffian crew before them swept. “Just then the prince, amid the gen'ral rout, “Hyperbius, his arch foe, had singled out; “Seizing upon him, as the wretch dismay'd “Sank prostrate and for mercy loudly pray'd, “‘Thou diest not now,’ he cried; ‘the time await, “‘When Caria's monarch shall pronounce thy fate.’ “And now the chief, the stranger host who led, “Approach'd, and thus with air respectful said. “‘Bravest and best of men! thou whom kind fate “‘Foredoom'd to govern the Armenian state, “‘Accept our duty, nor our service scorn. “‘Let this imperial crown thy brows adorn; “‘Emblem of royal state this mantle wear, “‘And, badge of sov'reign sway, this sceptre bear?’ “Thus saying, on his head the crown he plac'd, “And with the royal robe his shoulders grac'd; “When the whole host, as if with one accord, “Knelt at his feet, and hail'd him as their lord. “‘What mean ye?’ he exclaim'd. ‘Why thus to me “‘Present these signs of regal dignity?’ “‘Deem not our homage vain,’ the chief replied; “‘We cannot err with Providence our guide. “‘Lend me thy patience, royal Sir, while I “‘Unfold the dark decree of destiny.’ “All stood attentive, no one silence broke, “While of Zorastes' prophecy he spoke. “As he concluded his eventful tale, “Heriphila, who bleeding, faint, and pale “Lay on the deck, uprear'd her languid head, “And, with an air of joy expressive, said, “‘I die content, since gracious heav'n hath will'd “‘Its high behest by me should be fulfill'd. “‘Farewell, forgive me, lady! Let me share “‘Thy pitying thought and interceding pray'r.’ “As thus she panting spoke, her eyes she clos'd, “And sinking on the deck in death repos'd. “Nought now remain'd but from th' Armenian host “To send some warriors to the Cretan coast, “Where, ere they left Larissa, they had known “My brother and the Mysian king were gone. “The pirate vessel therefore with a band, “Under Hermantes' guidance, soon was mann'd. “When they departed, with a prosp'rous gale “To reach Mæonia's shore was spread our sail.” The princess ended. At her story's close On ev'ry side fresh gratulations rose, While good Chrysulphus thank'd indulgent heav'n, Which full completion to his wish had given. In either daughter's joy he took a part, And gave full vent to his impassion'd heart; And when, obedient to the cheering call, His noble guests he summon'd to the hall, The good old man each former care forgot, And breath'd thanksgivings for his blissful lot. Nor ended soon their revels. Gay delight Seem'd to give vigour to the steeds of night, Who with swift progress had their zenith gain'd, While yet Chrysulphus in the hall remain'd, And reckless of old age, and vig'rous still, Bad all his welcome guests their goblets fill, While, as each peer his favour'd fair one nam'd, A herald's voice the gen'ral toast proclaim'd, And laughter reign'd around, and jests still new And social mirth from ev'ry quarter flew, When suddenly approach'd with haggard look, And limbs which with convulsive terror shook, The captain of the guard. “Thrice gracious king!” Panting he cried, “disast'rous news I bring— “The Dragon Knight is flown!” Alarm'd, amaz'd, All on the pale informer wildly gaz'd, While, fill'd with indignation, from his throne Chrysulphus starting cried, “Hyperbius gone! “How, where escap'd he? Was he not in ward? “Where was thy vigilance to keep the guard!” “Dread sov'reign, hear!” the trembling warrior cried, “On what thy faithful servant states decide. “In a high turret, by strong bars secur'd “The object of thy justice was immur'd. “A band of trusty soldiers plac'd around “From all access its narrow circuit bound, “Save on the side, on which broad Hermus' stream “Made all escape impracticable seem. “As the loud bell proclaim'd each passing hour, “With watchful heed I visited the tow'r: “All still was safe, and still securely chain'd “In sullen mood the criminal remain'd. “At length, when midnight's solemn hour had chim'd, “To the lone turret's top again I climb'd. “Before the door the centinels were plac'd, “Who at brief intervals the platfom pac'd. “I op'd the dungeon's gate, when on the floor “I saw the chains the prisoner lately wore. “From a close-grated window, now time-worn, “A massive bar by violence was torn, “From this a cord appended”—“'Tis too plain,” Exclaim'd the king, “all vigilance was vain. “The pow'rs infernal, whom so long he serv'd, “His soul with more than human firmness nerv'd “To dare a leap of such tremendous height. “Think what may prove the issue of his flight— “The rav'ning wolf, 'scap'd from the hunter's toil, “Again with double rage our flocks will spoil; “All hell's black catalogue, lust, treason, fraud, “Hyprocrisy, now once more range abroad— “Haste, search around—through city, country, coast, “Let all be visited.—Send forth a host “Expert to trace the fugitive.—Away! “Him who retakes him amply will I pay.” Instant, inspir'd by hope of high reward, On ev'ry hand dispers'd the ready guard, While Caria's king, his soul absorb'd in thought, The still retirement of his chamber sought. Ere long arriv'd the bark from Creta's shore, Which the united princes safely bore. As mutual gratulations flow'd around, Sudden was heard a trumpet's pealing sound, And straight a youthful knight in arms array'd, Ent'ring, to both the kings obeisance made, And thus commenc'd his speech—“From her, whose hand “Holds delegated sway o'er Mysia's land, “Bearing commission, at this royal seat “The Carian and Mæonian kings I greet. “Long time, of both her princely sons bereft, “Without their aid the realm to govern left, “Hath she in silent anguish wept the fate, “Which, or from treason, or from foreign hate, “The kingdom with unnumber'd ills assail'd; “And though at length her rightful cause prevail'd, “Still each returning day her grief renew'd, “Since neither long-lamented son she view'd. “At length, to sooth her sorrows, came report “That both were present at Mæonia's court. “No more maternal tenderness requir'd: “By the fond hope of seeing them inspir'd, “She bad me hasten hither, and implore “Their presence may her long-lost peace restore.” “Behold both princes here,” Prothenor cried. “A suit thus pleaded may not be denied. “But first, I pray thee, yield to my request: “Long has thy travel been, and calls for rest; “Thine helmet and thine armour lay aside, “Beneath this friendly roof awhile abide, “For, though as yet unknown, thy knightly grace “May among princes worthily find place.” “Accept my humble thanks,” the knight replied. “Such courtesy might justify my pride, “If in my lowly breast I could presume “To give such disproportion'd inmate room. “I must not at a proud distinction aim, “Which nor my merits nor my station claim. “By birth not destin'd to adorn a court, “My sov'reign's patronage my sole support, “Can the obscure, ungrac'd Pisander dare “Mix with these princes or thy banquet share?” “Thou, thou Pisander!” Aracynthus cried, “Mysia's brave champion, her support, her pride! “While my tongue heralds thy surpassing fame, “Thus to thy friendship let me prove my claim. “Behold him, brother! take him as thine own, “The guardian, the defender of thy throne.” He said. Ere Orosmanes could reply, The youth, advancing, with a downcast eye Knelt at his feet. He utter'd not a word, Till from his side unbuckling his bright sword, “Let me, great Sir,” exclaim'd he, “thus resign “This heav'n-sent weapon, which of right is thine.” The king receiv'd it. For awhile amaz'd, And hardly crediting his sense he gaz'd On gift so unexpected. Forth he drew The glitt'ring blade, and held it up to view. “This once was mine,” he cried; “I pray thee tell “By what strange chance into thy hands it fell.” “If,” answer'd he, “my father's humble cot “By Mysia's monarch be not yet forgot, “He may recal a simple youth, who fir'd “By love of fame his splendid arms admir'd—” “I recollect thee well,” the king rejoin'd, “Thy port I notic'd, thy aspiring mind, “Which seem'd to raise thee far above the state “Allotted to thee by injurious fate. “'Twas surely more than common chance, which led “My wand'ring footsteps to thy father's shed, “That there, in lieu of arms, thy garb I took, “And this stout faulchion barter'd for thy crook. “More blest, alas! was thy exchange than mine: “How sad my destiny, how glorious thine! “I chas'd a phantom which my hopes deceiv'd, “For thee hath fate her noblest chaplet weav'd— “Enough of this—Brave youth! this weapon take, “Wield it again for mine, for Mysia's sake.” Starting from earth, with a respectful look And graceful air the youth the faulchion took. As by his side he plac'd it, “Fate,” he cried, “Hath now sufficient for my fame supplied. “What can ambition more of glory want, “What nobler meed can heav'n propitious grant!” “Most true,” said Caria's king. “His sov'reign's praise “May well a subject's exultation raise, “And wise the monarch is, who can discern “A subject's worth, and make him fit return. “'Tis the worst curse of royalty, that none “With independent minds approach the throne; “Each hath some sordid purpose, and pursues, “As suits it best, his interested views. “Such Orosmanes, need not raise thy fear; “From such suspicion this brave knight is clear. “No servile adulation stain'd his youth, “No flatt'rer he, who, daring in untruth, “To loathsome vice the garb of virtue lends, “And mocks the idol before which he bends. “Oh had I met with one like him! Had heav'n “To me a friend so estimable giv'n— “But why that idle wish? I might have spurn'd “Worth which I haply never had discern'd, “I, who could not beneath the surface look, “Who as my counsellor Hyperbius took—” “Banish,” exclaim'd Alcimedon, “a thought “With such injustice tow'rds thy virtues fraught. “No blame was thine, if blame indeed accrue “From crediting what prov'd a specious shew; “'Twas I misled thee, I first credence gave “To vileness cloth'd in an exterior brave. “Think on't no more—th' illusion now is past, “His arts are known, and truth prevails at last.” While he his father's sorrows sooth'd to rest, Prothenor sighing thus the youth address'd. “Howe'er undignified by rank or birth, “Thou hast achiev'd high honour by thy worth. “Yet can it be that one, whom nature's hand “Seems to have fashion'd for supreme command, “Should spring obscurely from an humble cot? “If such indeed were thy unworthy lot, “Monarchs may blush, whom, though to empire born, “Seldom such wreaths of early fame adorn. “Come with us, gallant Sir; as we converse, “Thou may'st thy deeds of hardihood rehearse.” He said, and grasping brave Pisander's hand, And closely follow'd by the princely band, To the proud hall, where sumptuously was spread The splendid banquet, courteously he led. Sweet music hail'd them: round the splendid board, With ev'ry tempting cate profusely stor'd, The noble guests were plac'd; mirth reign'd around, And gay festivity the ev'ning crown'd. At length—for pleasure will not always last— The moon by clouds obscur'd her zenith pass'd, When, with kind greeting and observance due, The guests illustrious from the hall withdrew. CANTO X. Brief prov'd their slumbers. Ere reviving day Had chas'd night's still increasing gloom away, From ev'ry quarter of the city, cries In soul-appalling concert rent the skies, With shrieks of horror mingled and deep moans, The clank of armour, screams, and dying groans, Shrill-braying trumpets, execrations dire, The crash of buildings, and loud shouts of fire! Rous'd by the clamour which around him rang, First from his pallet Aracynthus sprang, And to his oriel rush'd. The turbid air Reflected dismally a lurid glare, Through which at intervals thick clouds of smoke And shooting flames still more terrific broke. Marking their fatal course, more quick than thought The gallant youth his helm and buckler caught, His burnish'd coat of mail around him clasp'd, And in his hand his trusty faulchion grasp'd, When, from across the court, a sudden blaze From the roof streaming met his anxious gaze. Too certainly the fatal spot he knew. Tow'rds it with agonizing haste he flew— 'Twas his Zapheria's chamber!—With one stroke The portal which his entrance barr'd he broke. His arms the fair receiv'd. “Thank heav'n!” he cried, “She's safe! Unhurt I hold my lovely bride!” “Think not of me,” rejoin'd the trembling fair, “Where is my father, my Aspasia where? “Save them, Oh save them!”—Ere he could reply, Alcimedon with hurried step rush'd by. “Fear not, Zapheria,” he exclaim'd; “my friend “Will guard thy life, thy purity defend. “Haste to my father; he is old and weak: “Save him, while I our lov'd Aspasia seek.” Straight his fair mistress Aracynthus caught, And rapidly Chrysulphus' chamber sought. “Haste, royal Sir,” he cried, “ere yet too late “By instant flight avoid impending fate. “One daughter here upon thy steps attends, “Thine other brave Alcimedon defends. “Take refuge with Prothenor—Hence! Away! “Pregnant with peril is our further stay.” He said. With hasty footsteps they advanc'd. Around them fires in all directions glanc'd, And lit their path; when lo! a mounting flame From the proud palace of Prothenor came: Its far-extending roof one furnace seem'd, And each tall turret like a meteor gleam'd. “Within that blazing pile no safe retreat,” Cried Aracynthus, “can Zapheria meet. “Another course pursue—Ere yet too late, “Let us attempt to reach the eastern gate. “Not far off Zulphis stands. If that we gain, “In full security ye may remain.” No more—for louder now the clamour grew, And bands of savage mien appear'd in view. With one hand guiding the affrighted maid, High in the other wielding his bright blade, Th' undaunted youth held on his eager course. Closely Chrysulphus follow'd with his force, And aided by the now propitious flame, To the wide portal in the east they came. No further hindrance now their way impeach'd; Safely the plain they cross'd, and Zulphis reach'd, Where, from th' adjacent forts and stations round, Of mingled warriors a stout host they found. “Here,” Aracynthus cried, “secure from foes “Zapheria may with confidence repose, “By heav'n protected and her valiant sire. “Me other duties, other cares require. “Fear not, my love! 'Tis honour calls me hence, “Larissa's safety, and her king's defence.” Thus saying, on a vig'rous steed he leapt, And o'er the champaign swift as light'ning swept, Nor stopt he, till within the eastern gate, He saw two hosts engag'd in fierce debate. Those who collected in the portal stood, In foreign garb array'd, of aspect rude, Against their foes the straight'nd pass maintain'd, Who, 'spite of valour, small advantage gain'd. But soon two knights he saw, who, 'fore the rest, Their savage foeman resolutely press'd. Ere long, the well-known bearings on his shield The young Pisander in the first reveal'd, And, as more nearly drew the second knight, Brave Melixertes met his eager sight. His gallant soul their bright example stirr'd. Couching his spear, his gen'rous steed he spurr'd, And charg'd impetuously th' invading band. They shrank before his devastating hand, Not otherwise than when, on Barca's plain, Some lordly lion mid a tim'rous train Of antelopes destruction spreads around, And with promiscuous slaughter stains the ground. Nor mail nor buckler, could his lance oppose; He forc'd his way o'er ranks of prostrate foes, Nor stay'd, till meeting his associates brave, In one wide rout their scatter'd foes they drave. What transport then his feeling bosom swell'd, When safe from harm Prothenor he beheld, Who all unarm'd, and with uncertain tread, Fenc'd round by guards fair Chariclea led. “Come on,” cried Aracynthus; “danger lours; “Let us with speed repair to Zulphis' tow'rs. “There may we our disjointed force collect, “What of the city yet remains protect, “And pour our vengeance on the unknown foe, “Whose bold aggression caus'd its overthrow. “There Caria's king hath gain'd a safe retreat, “There fair Zapheria will thy daughter greet.” No more—The monarch his advice obey'd. To Zulphis quickly was their progress made, Where for a while, though still absorb'd in grief, In mutual tenderness they found relief. When from Prothenor's feast each noble guest In fancied safety had retir'd to rest, Sad Orosmanes, lost in painful thought, The close recesses of his chamber sought. Sleep, oft of wretchedness the only friend, To sooth his troubled soul no aid would lend: Unhonour'd was his couch; by the pale glare Lent by his lamp he ponder'd on his fair, While wayward fancy ev'ry charm pourtray'd Which deck'd his lovely but obdurate maid, And busy mem'ry with fond touch retrac'd Those happier days, when, by her favour grac'd, Phantoms of promis'd bliss his soul beguil'd And hope delusive on his prospects smil'd. Sudden, with visage which alarm bespoke On his close privacy Hermantes broke— “Arouse thee, royal Sir, some foe unknown “Hath scal'd the ramparts and surpris'd the town; “Amid the routed guards confusion reigns, “The crowded streets promiscuous slaughter stains, “On ev'ry quarter flames destructive rise, “And heave their blazing columns to the skies. “To the king's palace with increasing force “The raging element directs its course”— “There, there's my Chariclea!” cried the king, As, snatching up his sword, with sudden spring He sought the portal.—“Let us hasten hence— “Be thine of Caria's monarch the defence— “Protect his daughters—Love's resistless sway “And Chariclea summon me away!” Swifter than unimprison'd winds that sweep O'er ocean's face, and harrow up the deep, He flew, till from a band approaching near A sudden exclamation struck his ear— “Oh save Aspasia! Save the royal maid! “It is Artaces who implores thine aid!” No further pray'r his gen'rous soul requir'd. Onwards he boldly rush'd by vengeance fir'd, And with resistless force assail'd the crew, Who soon appall'd in all directions flew. “Seize this propitious moment,” loud he cried, “Away, Artaces, with thy lovely bride. “Farewell! I go where other cares demand “My instant services and succ'ring hand.” He said, and left them. They their way pursued. And soon the Zulphian walls in safety view'd. While there the royal pair repose enjoy'd, Far diff'rent cares Alcimedon employ'd. He sought Aspasia through each flaming hall— Vain prov'd each eager glance, each echoing call. And now, with danger more immediate fraught, The madd'ning element the high roof caught: Each massive beam confess'd its mast'ring pow'r; Their blazing fragments form'd a deadly show'r, Which, in despite of helm, his head had crush'd. He ceas'd his useless quest, and from the portal rush'd. What scenes survey'd he now, what horrors new! Prothenor's burning palace met his view! “Hermilia! Heav'ns!”—Twas now distraction all— Frantic he scal'd the intervening wall— On ev'ry side his searching glance he turn'd; On ev'ry side the pile majestic burn'd, Save where, amid the fires which fiercely spread, Still unconsum'd a turret rear'd its head, Half veil'd by rolling clouds of lurid smoke. Sudden, from forth its yielding summit broke Volumes of flame, and to his list'ning ear Came a shrill cry of agonizing fear. “'Tis she! 'Tis my Hermilia's self!” he cried, “Aid me, ye pow'rs who o'er true love preside!” Again arose a shriek—His eyes he rear'd— Hermilia at her oriel wide appear'd With hands outstretch'd, while the destroying flame Tow'rds her with energy resistless came. “Whoe'er thou art, save me!” she loudly cried, “Oh rescue me from this consuming tide!” With that, her vesture gath'ring close around, Headlong she cast herself. Upon the ground His firm foot planting, Caria's prince receiv'd In his spread arms the fair of sense bereav'd. All other cares were now absorb'd in one. The rose which erst had grac'd her cheek was flown, Clos'd were her eyes, on his enraptur'd view No longer beam'd their empyrean blue. Upon his neck she hung. He, as he rais'd His precious charge, upon her beauties gaz'd, And—ah how venial was the trespass!—press'd Th' unconscious maiden to his throbbing breast. Soon pass'd her trance, when, as she rais'd her eye And knew her brave deliv'rer, with a sigh From his embrace she timidly retir'd, While with delight sublim'd to rapture fir'd As on his knee he sank, with eyes uprais'd “May heav'n and holy saints,” he cried, “be prais'd, “Who made me thus thy blest protector prove! “Nor censure me, if I avow the love “Which o'er my heart hath reign'd with boundless scope, “Till now untold, untinctur'd yet by hope.” “Ah cease!” the deeply blushing maid replied, “'Tis destiny which must my fate decide. “I thank thee—'tis perhaps a phrase too weak— “I may not, gallant youth, I cannot speak— “Perfect thy gen'rous work, let still thine arm “Support and shield me from impending harm!” “My life and all its faculties are thine,” Exclaim'd the prince; “I freely would resign “Whate'er of wealth or pow'r the world can give, “Might in my breast one ray of hope survive. “But I forbear.—While yet th' occasion's our's, “Let us, fair princess, quit these mould'ring tow'rs.” He said; nor stay'd she. Through the vacant street They unmolested made their swift retreat, And through the eastern gate, with slaughter stain'd, While mantled yet the gloom, the champaign gain'd. Mysia's brave king meantime, soon as his blade Had clear'd a passage for the Carian maid, As if regardless of opposing force, Tow'rds th' Mæonian palace bent his course. As he approach'd it, in complete array A num'rous troop of horsemen barr'd his way. Ill such unwelcome hindrance could he brook: His ev'ry limb with wild impatience shook; Fiercely he rush'd upon the order'd foe, And him who led them with astounding blow Struck lifeless to the earth. Straight 'gainst his breast A grisly range of spears was plac'd in rest, And round him many a dart and javelin flew. And now commenc'd a combat strange and new; Yet, as if reckless of the peril rude, The king intrepidly the fight pursued, Till on a turret which adjacent stood, As if to witness this dread scene of blood, A Knight all arm'd, with vizor clos'd, appear'd, Who high a Dragon-blazon'd buckler rear'd. Soon as on Mysia's king a look he cast, “Let him not 'scape us,” cried he, “hold him fast! “Touch not his life—Your squadrons quickly close— “On ev'ry side encircle him with foes!” He said, nor disobey'd they his command. Dismounting from their steeds, the felon band Press'd him so nearly, his now useless sword Avail'd no longer to protect its lord. As when some lion, who o'er Libya's plain Hath long maintain'd his undisputed reign, When caught by toils, with indignation high Gnashes his teeth, from his red glaring eye Flash sparks of vengeful fury, while aloof His hunters stand and at his efforts scoff, So rag'd the king, when vile plebeian hands, His faulchion seizing, with unworthy bands Circled his arms, and with exulting cry Bore him away to base captivity. In a deep dungeon, which the sun's bright ray Ne'er visited, the hapless monarch lay. Close manacles his hands confin'd, his waist, Cuirass'd no more, a massive chain embrac'd. One distant lamp, whose dimly-twinkling beam More sad made all surrounding objects seem, Serv'd but to gild the horrors of his doom, And trace the outline of his dreary tomb. More light he needed not: no outward shew, No change of scene could dissipate his woe: Shame, disappointment, ev'ry mental pain In his vext mind usurp'd alternate reign, And rack'd to phrenzy seem'd his tortur'd brain, When lo! the sound of steps approaching near, And hum of mingling voices struck his ear: With sudden crash the door wide op'ning flew, And a bright glare of torches met his view. Between her guards with measur'd step advanc'd A dame of princely mien. As round she glanc'd Her eyes, whose jetty brilliancy might vie With brightest planets that adorn the sky, They met the captive king, who on the ground Sat motionless, absorb'd in thought profound, Oft breathing deep involuntary sighs, And fix'd on vacancy his glassy eyes. Awhile she earnestly his form survey'd, Which, in despite of suff'rings, still display'd The manly beauty, the chivalric worth, Which grac'd and dignified his royal birth; Then for her guards' departure signal made. Closing the door, they silently obey'd. When left alone, with fascinating air And smile of winning grace thus spoke the fair. “Can he, to whose high prowess in the field “The noblest knights of Asian lineage yield, “Can he prove craven when a lady sues, “Or her fair challenge to accept refuse? “I look'd to find thee in misfortune great, “Lord of thy mind, and master of thy fate. “As such still shew thyself. That brow unbend— “Know it is Iphimedia speaks, thy friend.” Starting, his downcast eyes the monarch rais'd, And on his visitant intently gaz'd, As anxious to discover in her face Of inward turpitude some lurking trace. No such disclosure met his eager view: Smooth shew'd her brow, o'er which, of auburn hue, Flow'd with becoming negligence her hair. Her skin, than vaunted down of swans more fair, With rosy health's resplendent tincture glow'd, In proof how pure the source from which it flow'd. No fierceness in her eye expressive shone, With melting tenderness it beam'd alone, Yet had on him its pow'rful glance no sway; Silent he gaz'd, and turn'd his look away. New passion now appear'd to shake her frame; More deep the colouring of her cheek became; Her eyes flash'd brighter fires; a wanton smile, Which might a hermit's frigid heart beguile, Play'd on her roseate lips, as thus she broke The tedious silence, and the king bespoke. “Cheer up, too pensive prince, nor thus lament “That fortune frustrated thy bold intent. “Though numbers triumph'd, though thy single hand “Could not such disproportion'd force withstand, “Still art thou Orosmanes, still thy name “Stands foremost in the chronicle of fame. “At casual thraldom wherefore then repine? “Think, if thou art a captive, thou art mine. “I am no tyrant, I no pleasure know “From exultation o'er a captiv'd foe, “And least of all o'er thee. Should I but speak, “Those manacles would fall, those bonds would break: “I need but will it, and a nobler crown “Would deck thee, and a more exalted throne. “I pause for a reply. Whether in me “To meet a friend or foe, waits thy decree.” “Whate'er,” replied he, “may thy purpose prove, “Thy courtesy my gratitude must move. “Tell me, kind lady, wilt thou set me free “From ev'ry bond save thankfulness to thee, “Or wilt thou name such ransom, as a king “To her who gave him liberty should bring? “Pronounce thy pleasure. Be it what it may, “'Tis mine to bow with def'rence and obey.” “I ask no ransom,” smiling she replied. “Far other aims my friendly purpose guide. “Were all the wealth that decks thy royal seat “Laid in one splendid tribute at my feet, “I would disdain the boon: my lib'ral heart “Scorns ev'ry thought where int'rest bears a part. “No! when I proffer liberty, I make “An offer which ambition's self might wake, “For which kings, conq'rors, heroes might compete, “Which, Orosmanes, even thou may'st greet. “Doubt'st thou my pow'r? If so, thou little know'st “What potency can Iphimedia boast. “Larissa is mine own: my sov'reign sway “Bithynia's ample provinces obey: “I bid thee share my crown, and with my hand “Would grace thee with unlimited command, “Would dedicate to thee myself, my charms, “All that can make me worthy of thy arms; “Beneath thy sway Prothenor's realm I'd bring, “His sceptre wrest from the imbecile king, “And, in his haughty Chariclea's place, “Hail thee the founder of a novel race.” “Think not,” the monarch cried, “thy specious art “Can tempt my senses, or seduce my heart. “No more. I would not further parlance hold “With one so fall'n, in daring crime so bold. “I'm in thy pow'r; whatever dire intent “Thy cruelty can urge or hate invent, “Employ against me—I'm for all prepar'd, “But let me be from further converse spar'd.” “Dar'st thou,” exclaim'd she, “such bold guise assume? “Then know me as the mistress of thy doom, “And mark me, railer! in this darksome cell “Victim of lonely anguish shalt thou dwell, “Till twice two days be past. Then, if thy soul “Yield to my hope, and bend to my controul, “Though thy proud words and ill-advis'd disdain “From me far other recompence should gain, “Still unimpeach'd my proffer'd boon shall stand, “A sceptre thine, and Iphimedia's hand. “But if insensible thy heart shall prove, “Should'st thou then mock my pow'r and scorn my love, “For grace, for mercy, cherish not a hope! “I give to vengeance an unbounded scope.” Thus spake she rapidly, nor added more. Behind her, grating clos'd the dungeon's door. As yet unconscious of the cruel fate Which valiant Orosmanes might await, The chiefs, whom fortune had to Zulphis brought, How to redress her wrongs in council sought. While, yet uncertain all and unresolv'd, A thousand various projects they revolv'd, A braying clarion's loud appeal was heard, And straight a herald at the gate appear'd. “Audience,” said he, “and licence free I seek, “While what Bithynia's queen commands I speak. “Her victor brows though glory's meed hath grac'd, “Though in long perspective may still be trac'd “Yet vaster conquests, my benignant queen, “Most just and kind when most successful seen, “Prefers that all hostilities may cease, “And on conditions fair thus proffers peace. “Though through thy realm far spread her potent sway, “Though proud Larissa's walls her flag display, “To thee Prothenor, will she yield the town “And leave thee master of thy realm and throne, “Should the fair terms, on which may be resign'd “Thy captur'd capital, acceptance find. “First she requires betwixt herself and thee “Alliance firm and lasting amity: “Next, to maintain this compact, from thy hands “My queen a hostage dignified demands, “And, that unquestion'd may remain her claims, “To be that hostage she Aspasia names, “Whose plighted hand the princely peer shall grace, “Who next in station to herself holds place.” Scarce had he spoken, when throughout the hall Furious up-rose the gen'rous chieftains all, And ev'ry warrior, circling round the maid, Shook his tall spear, or rear'd his trenchant blade. Unmov'd the herald cried, “Should ye refuse, “Say if my queen's alternative ye choose. “Either Aspasia with her wish complies, “Or Orosmanes on a scaffold dies.” No more the hall with threats of vengeance rung; Pale ev'ry visage, mute was ev'ry tongue, Till Aracynthus the dread silence broke, And thus the harbinger of ill bespoke. “I know too well thy queen's insidious art, “How far her tongue is foreign from her heart, “To give an easy credence to a wile, “Fram'd to alarm our feelings and beguile. “In heav'n's high name I charge thee, herald, say “What means the menace which thy words convey?” “Freely,” said he, “will I the truth unfold. “Yon walls the captive Orosmanes hold; “By weighty fetters are his limbs secur'd, “Within a dungeon he remains immur'd. “Myron—Mæonia's monarch knows him well— “Is nam'd the keeper of his lonely cell; “Whose life stands pledg'd that, at my sov'reign's word, “Against the king he will direct his sword. “One day my queen for your decision gives; “Then Orosmanes yields to fate or lives.” He said, and from the royal presence pass'd. Silent th' assembly stood, confus'd, aghast, Save Chariclea, who with air serene, A calm spectatress of the mournful scene, Appear'd by his distressful state unmov'd, Who had so constantly, so truly lov'd. “Know'st thou this Myron,” to her sire she said, “Whom her base tool th' imperious queen hath made?” “I knew him well;” said he, “of all my court “The most despis'd, and of the worst report; “His visage, faithful index of his mind, “Bespeaks a soul rapacious and confin'd: “To gen'rous feelings callous, for vile pelf “The wretch would sell his country and himself.” “If such his character,” replied the fair, “Heav'n shield the captive trusted to his care!” “How!” cried Alcimedon? Doth then thy heart “For him who lov'd thee take no warmer part? “Can'st thou unmov'd on his distresses dwell, “Whose only fault was loving thee too well?” “Acts speak themselves;” said she, “each thought our own, “The heart accountable to heav'n alone. “While that approves, I see no plea, no cause, “To make professions, or to court applause.” As thus she spoke, her bright but haughty eye A glance of anguish mix'd with dignity Cast o'er th' assembly: pallid was her hue, And sad her air, as slowly she withdrew. A gen'ral murmur through th' warriors ran, When Aracynthus rising thus began. “Too well that queen's obduracy I know, “To doubt her conduct tow'rds a captiv'd foe. “The ransom she proposes we disdain; “No hope, save those which arms afford, remain: “One day is granted us, one precious day, “To save my brother from her impious sway. “Let us this night the citadel assail, “Shrouded in gloom the lofty ramparts scale, “Their slumb'ring chiefs and centinels surprise, “And reach the cell where Orosmanes lies—” No more he said, for now each gen'rous breast With kindred zeal and ardour was impress'd. Forth rush'd the gallant chiefs—no rest, no pause— Each his peculiar band together draws, And, watching anxiously the waning light, Anticipates the toils of the ensuing night. CANTO XI. While thus with unremitting zeal they wrought, Audience of Caria's king Artaces sought. “Mid doubts, and fears, and all a lover's grief, “I come,” he sighing cried, “to seek relief, “From Iphimedia's grasp to guard my fair, “Not more thine own, than my peculiar care. “In heav'n's pure eye she is my plighted spouse— “Mine own confirm her—ratify our vows! “Then let the queen her proud demand repeat: “Her menace then we may securely meet, “When Caria's and Bithynia's pow'rs unite “To check her course and vindicate our right.” “Take my lov'd child,” the Carian king replied, “To thy protection I her weal confide. “Come with me, prince; the time admits not pause: “Arm'd with a father's sanction plead thy cause.” Encircled by her sorrowing damsels round, And lost in grief the suff'ring fair they found. But soon a parent's voice, a lover's pray'r, Chas'd from her lighten'd breast the fiend despair. When with each argument which reason knows, Which honour warrants, or from love which flows, Such suitors join to urge their fond intent, Can female tenderness withhold assent? Aspasia's soul far diff'rent feelings mov'd; No doubts disturb'd her, for she fondly lov'd. A smile confess'd the truth she dar'd not speak, A blush of tenderness suffus'd her cheek, As in heav'n's sight Artaces hail'd her spouse, And holy priest confirm'd their mutual vows. His western goal the sun had now attain'd, And o'er the wide horizon darkness reign'd: No longer blaz'd the fires, to whose dire sway Larissa's splendid domes had fall'n a prey; Her ample ruin deepest night had veil'd, And o'er heav'n's concave clouds thick-mantling sail'd. Within the Zulphian gate a warlike band, Prepar'd to execute what honour plann'd, Stood in well order'd line, while ev'ry chief Gave, as along he pass'd, instruction brief, Till noble Aracynthus, 'fore the rest Advancing, thus th' expectant host address'd. “Comrades and friends! th' eventful hour is come, “When, to preserve my brother from the doom “Impending o'er him, I implore your aid. “If ever yet your courage was display'd, “If in your hearts th' gen'rous ardour glow, “Which prompts to deeds of virtue, prove them now. “No common motives your exertions claim: “A monarch's life, his liberty, his fame, “Mæonia's safety, Mysia's threaten'd state, “Involv'd too surely in her sov'reign's fate, “All with accumulated force unite “To move your pity and your zeal excite. “But why to spirits, which already feel “The spur of valour, make I thus appeal? “On ev'ry shield the clash of swords I hear, “Vibrates in ev'ry hand the glitt'ring spear. “On then, my friends, and for your king belov'd “Be your pure loyalty and courage prov'd. “To yonder citadel, where in close ward “His impious foes the captive hero guard, “Advance!—As ye success and fame would gain, “Silence and strictest discipline maintain.” Instant they march'd, and still their course pursued, Till mid the gloom the citadel they view'd. All in repose seem'd wrapt. With eager haste Their ladders 'gainst the walls th' assailants plac'd, And Aracynthus, who in danger's post Was ever first, led on the daring host, When suddenly burst forth a blazing light; The tow'rs, th' embattled walls, the rampir'd height Were lin'd with combatants, whose shouts and cries In soul-appalling chorus rent the skies. Terrific was their martial shew, and dense The range of spears, which form'd a grisly fence Against th' invading foe, while on each hand, Arm'd with still more tremendous pow'rs, a band Jav'lins and darts and rocky fragments vast From catapulta and balista cast, Or Grecian fires, whose flames of livid hue No waters quench, in all directions threw. Hurl'd by the foe, prone from the topmost wall Crush'd and o'erwhelm'd the leading vet'rans fall; Successive ranks to fill their station rush, Successive torrents the bold victims crush, When, suddenly, from the expanding gate, Like vengeful ministers of ruthless fate, Rush'd forth a host, which falling on their rear Wrought new dismay and doubled ev'ry fear. Meantime, while round him death and horror reign'd, Brave Aracynthus on the height remain'd. Aloft, conspicuous through the lurid gloom, Pre-eminently wav'd his snow-white plume; His ample buckler 'fore him spread, his hand High brandishing his death-dispensing brand, Amid the terrors of th' appalling scene So bold he seem'd, so fearless, so serene, That, struck with awe and dreading his attack, In momentary fear his foes fell back. Seizing th' occasion, “On my friends!” he cried, “Let one bold enterprise our fate decide!” No more he added, but with desp'rate bound Leapt from the height and firmly trod the ground. Some, following close, with him the rampart pass'd, Some, less successful, from its ridge were cast, While all around, without the walls, within, Echo'd the clang of arms, the battle's din, And Discord, hov'ring in the murky sky, Shriek'd as her fatal torch she rear'd on high, And Death, exulting in the bloody fray, Shook his fell dart and smil'd upon his prey. Still Aracynthus, like the fiery tide Which from convuls'd Vesuvius' ruptur'd side Bursts with resistless fury, far and near Spread through the hostile ranks dismay and fear. But all unequal now the contest grew; No more his vet'rans could th' assault renew, Their life-blood drain'd from many a gaping wound, They sank, and dying press'd th' encrimson'd ground: Alone their gallant leader now remain'd, Alone undauntedly the strife sustain'd. Not fabled Mars, when from his Thracian height He breathes defiance and provokes the fight, Shew'd half so terrible. As round he cast His threat'ning eye, the foe shrank back aghast; His onset dread no more could they abide, They fled the contest which they late defied, When on a tow'r the Dragon shield was rear'd, And this dread mandate was distinctly heard— “Cease, Aracynthus! nor prolong a strife, “On which depends thy Orosmanes' life. “If thou again to dare our force presume, “He dies, and thou art author of his doom; “Yield, and he lives. Surrender up thy sword, “And take as pledge of faith Hyperbius' word.” Deep sank the sounds in Aracynthus' soul; A deadly horror o'er his senses stole, His bosom with a sigh convulsive heav'd; Awhile he stood as if of life bereav'd; Then, as at once collecting all his pow'r, He cast a mournful glance upon the tow'r, And, with a gesture of despair, his shield And blood-stain'd faulchion dropt upon the field. Without the walls still wide confusion reign'd, And still opposing hosts the fight maintain'd. Artaces here, leaving his lovely bride, With hostile gore the crowded champaign dyed, There Melixertes, ranging o'er the field, His pristine fame and knightly worth reveal'd; There, reckless of their spears and corslets mail'd, The thronging foes Alcimedon assail'd, While like an angry pard Pisander rag'd, His spirit high, his vengeance unassuag'd, Though from his arm a stream ensanguin'd ran, And his fast waning strength to fail began. As when the deep conflicting winds deform, O'er the vext billows the resistless storm Uncheck'd dominion holds: should then the will, Which rais'd it, bid its whelming blasts be still, The tempest straight subsides, calm'd are its waves, And ocean sleeps in his remotest caves; So still'd, so hush'd became the boist'rous fray, When from the wall a trumpet's piercing bray Bespoke a parley. Ev'ry anxious eye With consentaneous glance was rais'd on high, Aud every breast with expectation swell'd, When on the ramparts' summit they beheld Two warriors. Diff'rent were their air and mien: One as a captive without helm was seen, The other arm'd at all points for the field, And rearing vauntingly his Dragon shield. “Behold,” cried he, “whom fate hath made my prize! “Give o'er th' assault, or Aracynthus dies. “Hence! and report, when next your kings you see, “That I, Hyperbius, rule their destiny.” As thus in high and vaunting terms he spoke, From those around him shouts triumphant broke, While each assailing chief his banner low'r'd, And turn'd to earth his unavailing sword. As a tall rock, which o'er its Alpine peers Its tow'ring brow pre-eminently rears, Though storms assail and lightnings glare around, Still in primæval majesty is found, So Aracynthus stood. His brow serene By trace of anguish still unmark'd was seen. With dauntless look and gesture, to the sky, As if his hope were there, he rais'd his eye, Then tow'rds his friends with air of high command, In signal of retreat, he wav'd his hand. “Retire,” he cried,—“Trust me to heav'n—Adieu!—” He turn'd, and proudly from the wall withdrew. None spoke, none mov'd, all stood with awe impress'd, Till thus Alcimedon the host address'd. “The word of fate has pass'd. We must submit, “For Aracynthus' sake the field must quit. “Our prompt obedience is his best defence; “In council rests our sole dependence.—Hence! “To Zulphis march! The interval is brief, “But may be well employ'd for his relief.” O'erwhelm'd with grief and shame the host obey'd. The foe no sign of opposition made, But fill'd the air with shouts of joy around, As 'cross the plain their mournful march they wound. Hyperbius now, escorted by the guard By whom the captive prince was held in ward, To the apartment hasten'd, where the queen, Uncertain what such sudden din might mean, Expectant sat. He bad the guard await His further will, and ent'ring clos'd the gate. “Exult, my queen!” he cried, “Success is mine— “To reap the harvest it presents be thine. “Now shall thy brow be grac'd by conquest's meed— “The captive Aracynthus here I lead”— “He!” Aracynthus! Captive too!” she cried, “Who scorn'd my love, my vengeance who defied? “Now, now indeed I'm queen! The prop, the trust “Of those who mock'd my claims is laid in dust. “Is't to thy prowess I this triumph owe? “Ask what thou will'st—take all I can bestow. “But where's this fallen hero, this ingrate, “This object of my vengeance and my hate? “Here as an humble suppliant let him come; “Here trembling stand when I pronounce his doom.” “Obey'd shall be thy pleasure,” he rejoin'd, “But let my counsel fair acceptance find. “That in a soul like thine, so great, so vast, “Remembrance deep of injuries should last, “I marvel not; for mem'ry will repeat “Wrongs unredress'd, and great revenge is sweet. “But, though alluring the temptation seem, “Unfit the time to yield to it I deem. “Much yet remains to do, and much to learn— “What answer may th' united kings return— “How on thy proffer'd terms they may decide— “Whether Aspasia shall become my bride— “Unknown, uncertain all!—In thine own hand “Thou hold'st a pledge which must success command—” “Where learn'st thou,” cried the queen, “with meddling speech “To check my purpose, or my will impeach? “Silence! And know that she, who made thee great, “Can hurl thee lower than thy pristine state. “Answer me not, but my behest obey— “Bring here my captive instantly—Away!” Ill could such taunting words Hyperbius brook; His eyes glanc'd fire, his limbs with anger shook, By passion's with'ring touch his cheek was blench'd, His hand unconsciously his poniard clench'd: But soon the transitory feeling fled; Smooth'd was his brow, a smile of import dread Beam'd o'er his face, as with submissive mien And voice subdued he thus address'd the queen. “Ah! spurn not from thee thus thy faithful slave, “Let him thy grace, thy mild indulgence crave. “Sacred be thy command. Whate'er thy will, “This hand assur'd thy sentence shall fulfil.” “Be thus,” replied she, “thy obedience shewn. “Let Aracynthus enter—and alone.” Frowning she spoke. Hyperbius straight retir'd, His air serene, his breast with vengeance fir'd: Nor long the captive his approach delay'd. For a brief moment, as he first survey'd Th' imperious queen, a tinge of vivid red Suffus'd his front, his manly cheek o'erspread. But soon in ev'ner current ran his blood: As if collected in himself he stood, While, as with aspect stern on him she gaz'd, And busy thought wild recollections rais'd Of love, of hate, of horror, of despair, Flush'd was her cheek, indignant grew her air; Her rolling eyes with vengeful fury flam'd, As thus in hurried accents she exclaim'd— “Thanks to the pow'rs, whate'er they be, that guide “Thy destiny, or o'er my fate preside, “I hold thee now securely! Where is now “That port majestic, that commanding brow, “That 'witching smile of dignity and grace, “Which gave such pow'r to that perfidious face? “For shame! so quickly daunted? Now again “Assume the look of insolent disdain “With which thou left'st me, treat me with neglect, “Again the heart I proffer'd thee reject! “But why on earth is fix'd the hero's eye? “Why heaves his breast? Does a repentant sigh “Struggle for vent? Repress the futile breath! “In souls like mine love scorn'd is rage, is death!” Panting she ceas'd; when with an air serene Th' intrepid captive tow'rds th' infuriate queen Rais'd his bright eyes. So might an angel gaze On some fall'n seraph's vice-contorted face, Calm in his virtue. No unworthy plaint Tarnish'd his lips, or gave his glory taint. Th' indignant queen, mov'd as by magic sway, Paus'd, wonder'd, gaz'd—and gaz'd her hate away. As the vext waters, when by mounds detain'd, Break through the barriers which their force restrain'd, Down foams the torrent till it meets the plain, Where still'd it sparkles to the sun again, So sank the tide of Iphimedia's ire: Her eye-balls glowing with unhallow'd fire, “Speak, speak,” she cried, “Let me but hear thy voice— “Barbarian! tiger! yet my heart's first choice! “Thou know'st it, cruel prince! for thou hast prov'd “How strongly once, how tenderly I lov'd, “How for thy sake I dar'd encounter shame, “Esteem'd at nought my duty, rank, and fame! “Think'st thou I'm chang'd?—Ah no! Sooner yon sun “Through heav'n with progress retrograde shall run, “Sooner yon stream shall flow with backward course, “Than love like mine exhaust its tyrant force. “I cannot hate thee, Aracynthus!—No! “Thron'd in my heart, my direst, dearest foe!— “Ah! spare my kindling blushes—Guess the rest— “Let me, oh let me with a smile be blest!” As thus she spoke, the queen of beauty's grace Moulded each gesture, languish'd in her face; From her fair eye-lids gems of chrystal stole, And hush'd to peace appear'd her phrenzied soul. “I scorn'd not then nor now such charms,” he cried, “Nor haply had my youthful heart defied “Their all-subduing influence, had heav'n, “Which fram'd such loveliness, its sanction giv'n. “But on another was thy hand bestow'd, “Thy plighted faith was to another vow'd, “That other was my friend, who, ever just “To his own honour, did not mine distrust.” “Dissolv'd that fatal tie,” exclaim'd the queen, “Such cruel bars no longer intervene. “Free as the sportive tenants of the grove, “I dedicate my soul to thee and love. “Yes, Aracynthus! I am all thine own, “My boasted charms, my pow'r, Bithynia's throne, “All, all are thine! With Iphimedia's hand “Her realm, her soul, her destiny command!— “Lord of my life! what means that gesture sad? “Why is thy brow with gloom repulsive clad? “Look, look upon me—speak to me—impart “Some ray to guide my love-bewilder'd heart!” “How shall I answer thee?” replied the youth. “I cannot feign, and thou wilt hate the truth. “Transcendent tho' thy charms, thy pow'r tho' great, “Mistress of mine and Orosmanes' fate, “Though our existence on thy will depend, “I must at once the fond delusion end, “Which now nor faith nor honour will allow. “Pledg'd to another is my sacred vow.” “Ador'd—Affianc'd—Speak!—Thy bride?—Thy wife?— “The lov'd—the loath'd companion of thy life?” “Belov'd, oh queen! affianc'd in heav'n's sight, “Though not completed yet the holy rite.” Pale as the snows on Ætna's brow which lie Became her lips, her cheek of roseate dye, While in her soul convuls'd all Ætna flam'd. Veiling her rage in scorn, she thus exclaim'd— “Thou lov'st, coy Sir! I like thy frankness well. “Pledg'd as thou art, 'twill pang thy heart to dwell “In her loath'd presence, object of thy hate, “Careless to hide it, though her nod is fate. “Thou may'st retire—Calm solitude suits best “To soothe the sorrows of an am'rous breast. “What ho! Hyperbius!—Instant to his cell “Conduct the slave! To-morrow's midnight bell “Perchance may 'wake him from his dream of bliss, “And death's cold lips bestow the bridal kiss.” “What heav'n decrees, to suffer or to die, “To that I bend; but bend not to a lie.” The hero said: unmov'd in port or hue God-like he turn'd, and from her sight withdrew. Immers'd in thought, while traversing the court, Appear'd Hyperbius. Sudden, stopping short, A signal to the watchful guard he made To leave him with their pris'ner. They obey'd, And stood apart, while with a voice suppress'd And air of myst'ry he the prince address'd. “Thou'st heard the stern decree which dooms thy fate. “Expect no mercy from her vengeful hate. “But let not cheering hope desert thy soul: “Rely on me, I can her pow'r controul. “Nay, look not thus incredulous—on me, “More than on her, depends thy destiny. “She bade me lodge thee in a lonesome cell, “There to abide thy death-announcing knell. “Far diff'rent from her foul intent is mine: “Thou shalt thy brother Orosmanes join— “Answer me not, nor let a look betray “The purpose which I meditate.—Away! “Be of good courage—Trust to me in need. “Guards! to your post; to yonder tow'r proceed.” In doubt and wonder Aracynthus lost Resum'd his progress. Soon the court they cross'd, And through a passage, where the wav'ring light Cast by an untrimm'd lamp deceiv'd the sight, Came to a massive gate by bars secur'd. “Here must your pris'ner straitly be immur'd;” Hyperbius cried, “So wills Bithynia's queen. “Be your observance of her mandate seen.” The gate on hoarsely-creaking hinges turn'd. A wide and gloomy vault, the prince discern'd, Where, scarce distinguishable by the ray Lent by a fissure small, a captive lay. “Enter!” exclaim'd Hyperbius, “here await, “Till Iphimedia shall pronounce thy fate.” Then 'fore the rest advancing with the prince, “Let this,” he whisp'ring saith, “my faith evince. “Rely on me.—I dare not tell thee more.” He said, and clos'd in haste the pond'rous door, And, his whole soul absorb'd in anxious thought, The close recesses of his chamber sought. With interrupted steps the floor he pac'd, And, as the quick-succeeding plans he trac'd Which in his agitated mind awoke, His purpose thus in broken accents spoke. “So far, so well—These easy cred'lous fools “Become in wise men's hands the aptest tools. “Two now are mine, and I will hold them still, “Till fortune all my tow'ring hopes fulfil: “They on my head shall fix Bithynia's crown, “Or answer for their failure with their own; “They shall secure Aspasia as my wife, “Or undergo themselves divorce from life. “My wanton fancy revels in the scene— “But hold—That lustful, overbearing queen— “May not she trouble—Tut! I hold her fast— “She little dreams what toils are round her cast; “Her Saracens, each leader of her line, “Corrupt and venal all, are wholly mine. “True—But meanwhile, ere yet it be complete, “May not her violence my plan defeat? “It may be—nay, 'tis sure—I cannot trust “To her mad passion, her unbridled lust. “I overheard it all—her am'rous pray'r, “Her hopes, her fears, her anguish, her despair. “While for the moment vengeance rules her soul, “Her practis'd hand may drug the fatal bowl, “Or wield with aim assur'd the murd'rous knife, “Which ends at once my project and his life. “Or say—what haply yet may prove th' event— “To gratify her passion he consent. “What then?—Why then he mounts Bithynia's throne, “By glorious arts so nearly made mine own. “I will not trust her.—No! the die is cast, “The hour of destiny is come at last. “Here, in this phial, rests the potent drop, “Whose rapid influence can life's current stop, “Compounded by herself with subtlest art “To reach her froward Aracynthus' heart. “Now shall it reach her own.—No turn more fair, “Than that the draught she mingled she should share.— “Come, precious Alchemy! thou sov'reign balm, “Whose magic can the soul's wild tempest calm, “Come! when her lips the well-drugged chalice drain, “Rush through each artery, search her burning brain, “Till death at length her struggling soul shall free, “And leave Bithynia's pow'rful realm to me.” With that he hastily the phial caught, And with quick steps the queen's apartment sought. When by Hyperbius left, in thought profound Stood Aracynthus. Through the gloom around Wistful he cast his penetrating eye. As it the captive met, a deep-drawn sigh Smote on his ear. He darted to the place, And caught the mourner in his strict embrace. “Turn, Orosmanes! to thy brother tell “All thou hast suffer'd in this dreary cell, “Hear him recount the adverse chance which led— “But wherefore thus avert thy drooping head? “Why shrink from my embrace? Why is thy hand “Stretch'd forth, as if my absence to command?” “In pity cease,” a gentle voice replied, “Let me my grief, my name in silence hide. “No longer Orosmanes' fate deplore. “These walls detain him not. Enquire no more.” “Gone! Say'st thou?” cried he, “From this dungeon flown? “When—where—oh! tell me, in this turret lone “What kind preserver—But it cannot be— “From Iphimedia who could set him free? “Speak, I adjure thee, speak to me—at once, “As heaven shall succour thee, his fate announce.” “He lives, is free, is safe at this blest hour! “On me kind heav'n bestow'd the means, the pow'r, “On me its feeble instrument. My fate, “Whate'er it prove, I patiently await.” “First,” said the prince, “to all-protecting heav'n “Let, as behoves, adoring thanks be giv'n, “And next to thee, dear youth! But who art thou, “To whom eternal gratitude I vow, “Whose name with ev'ry fervent pray'r must blend, “When to heav'n's gate my orisons ascend?” Deeply, as thus he spake, the stranger sigh'd. Sudden, the cumb'ring cloak was cast aside, Whose ample folds both form and face conceal'd, And lo! what seem'd a vision was reveal'd. Absorb'd in silent wonder, aw'd, amaz'd, His eyes distrusting, Aracynthus gaz'd. “Can I,” at length he cried, “my sight believe, “Or does my sense some potent spell deceive? “Thine ev'ry lineament and grace the same, “Thee as Mæonia's heir I would proclaim, “And trembling add fair Chariclea's name. “For ever,” said she, “are those titles gone; “For this dark cell is chang'd Mæonia's throne. “My life is forfeit. In this dreary tow'r “Who can escape fell Iphimedia's pow'r? “Whate'er her deadliest malice may ordain, “Spite of my sex, my firmness can sustain, “And—for my heart applauds the gen'rous deed— “Martyr to love and honour let me bleed!” “Thy love!” exclaim'd he: “Did I hear aright? “Thou, who couldst Orosmanes' passion slight!” “Concealment,” answer'd she, “would now be vain. “Hear me, while thus my conduct I explain. “When, yet unknown his station and his name, “As humble Polydore thy brother came, “My heart did justice to his signal worth: “But, when reveal'd his name and royal birth, “When in the hero who my sire had sav'd, “Who for my sake stern Damocles had brav'd, “I saw the lover, who so well had prov'd “How constantly, how tenderly he lov'd, “My heart, by nature for affection fram'd, “His sway confess'd”—“Why then,” the prince exclaim'd, “Were so repaid such tenderness and truth? “Ah! why was he condemn'd to waste his youth “In hopeless anguish?”—“My responsive breast “Perhaps,” said she, “an equal flame confess'd, “But more th' injunction of my sire forbad. “In solemn accents, and with visage sad, “‘Daughters,’ said he, ‘when I obedience crave, “‘I ask what you, what me, alone can save. “‘Over yourselves, my royal house, my head, “‘The veil of threat'ning destiny is spread. “‘Seek not for explanation, nor presume “‘To penetrate th' inexplicable doom, “‘With which our arbiters the secret shroud. “‘To ward it from us is alone allow'd, “‘And ye alone can ward it. Here, 'fore heav'n “‘Be pledg'd your vow, your firm engagement giv'n, “‘That ne'er, whate'er of good or ill betide, “‘Of mortal man ye shall become the bride, “‘Till of relenting fate th' injunction cease, “‘And my approval sanction your release. “‘Such terms the rulers of our fate require. “‘Swear—Save yourselves, your country, and your sire.’ “With agitated voice and air he said: “We heard, we wept, we trembled, we obey'd. “Slave to my duty, from that fatal day “Ne'er did my heart what most it felt betray. “I shunn'd the hero whom my soul approv'd, “When most averse I seem'd, then most I lov'd; “But when of his impending fate I knew, “To duty and to fond affection true, “All female apprehensions I repress'd, “Found him, preserv'd his life.—Thou knowest the rest.” “Oh thou,” cried he, “whom ne'er till now I knew, “How tow'rs thy mind exalted on my view! “Sister of Aracynthus' soul! Oh tell “By what persuasive word or magic spell “Could Orosmanes leave thee? How prevail'd “The voice of love, when hate or scorn had fail'd, “To send him from thee? How could he depart, “And leave expos'd the treasure of his heart?” “Deem not so wrongly of him,” she exclaim'd, “Let not his truth, his gratitude be blam'd. “He did not, could not know me. O'er my head “With fold redoubled was my mantle spread, “With voice far diff'rent from mine own I spoke, “No treach'rous sigh from my fond bosom broke. “Never, no never could I have reveal'd “The secret love I had so long conceal'd, “Nor Orosmanes, had he haply guess'd “By whom the suit so earnestly was press'd, “Had yielded to my pray'r, or stoop'd to buy “By my exposure life and liberty. “When night around had spread her fav'ring shade, “Unknown to all, in manly garb array'd, “Myron, the keeper of this tower, I sought. “My proffer'd gold so on his av'rice wrought, “That when I pray'd, till one short hour were flown, “I with his pris'ner might remain alone, “He grasp'd my purse, and granted my request. “Nor was my second artifice less blest. “I with thy brother pass'd for Myron's son, “Who, that he might impending danger shun, “Had feign'd submission, though his loyal heart “In his king's int'rests took a feeling part. “‘Embrace,’ said I, ‘the moment given by fate; “‘Loos'd are thy bonds, unbarr'd the dungeon's gate: “‘Take this disguise I bring; this knotted cord “‘To pass the ramparts will the means afford. “‘Fear not for me; my kinsman Myron's love “‘From me all danger surely will remove.’— “What need of more?—The pow'rs which virtue save “To my charm'd tongue resistless influence gave. “His scruples fled—past was our fated hour— “Myron his signal gave— he left the tow'r.”— As thus with interrupted voice she said, Tears from her eyes distill'd, she droop'd her head. The pitying prince in silence breath'd a pray'r, That heav'n such truth and purity would spare. While 'neath Larissa's walls the battle rag'd, What doubts, what cares Prothenor's mind engag'd? 'Twas not alone the recent stroke of fate, His menac'd empire, or his alter'd state, That robb'd of peace his agitated breast. No less than these invaders of his rest, A thousand sad remembrances arose, Which reason fail'd to banish or oppose. Still meditating on his fate severe, His cheek was moisten'd by a trickling tear, When suddenly a trumpet's pealing note Upon his ear with mournful cadence smote, And soon approaching with afflicted mien, The chiefs who late his presence left were seen. Silent awhile they stood by grief oppress'd, Till thus Alcimedon the king address'd. “Baffled, discomfited, our glory lost, “Lo! from Larissa's wall returns the host, “Which but this morn, elate with martial pride, “All obstacles, nay fortune's self defied. “Would that my speech the tidings sad might spare!— “Prepare, Prothenor! for the worst prepare— “Brave Aracynthus—On Hyperbius' hate “And Iphimedia's vengeance rests his fate. “Heading the warriors who the fort assail'd, “The rampir'd height intrepidly he scal'd: “We saw him mount, and from its summit steep “First of his daring band beheld him leap. “As his assault to second we essay'd, “The foe an unexpected sally made, “And from the battlements, the walls which crown, “A mingled show'r of darts and stones was thrown, “Which check'd our progress, and compell'd our band “With front revers'd the rude assault withstand. “As rag'd the fight, a clarion's piercing call “For parlance sounded.—On the topmost wall, “Bound by harsh bonds we Aracynthus view'd! “Near him the Dragon Knight Hyperbius stood. “‘He lives,’ cried he, ‘if instant ye depart: “‘Stay, and this steel is buried in his heart!’”— He stopt, for choak'd his utt'rance was by grief; And lost in silent anguish stood each chief, When steps approaching rapidly were heard, And strait Auletes in the hall appear'd, Auletes who, while stood Prothenor's throne, As first among his chamberlains was known. With troubled air th' expecting chiefs he ey'd, And pallid was his cheek as thus he cried. “A harsh and cruel task must I fulfil; “For lo! I come the messenger of ill. “When of yon walls the foe possession gain'd, “Mix'd with the crowd I thus disguis'd remain'd. “This morn, when your brave host the town assail'd, “And Aracynthus had the rampart scal'd, “I witness'd how the gallant hero fought, “What matchless deeds of chivalry he wrought. “How can I speak the issue of the strife? “He lost himself to save his brother's life. “They led him to the queen. What pass'd none knew; “But suddenly the portal open flew, “And Iphimedia call'd her ready guard. “‘Seize him,’ exclaim'd she, ‘keep him in strict ward; “‘On your lives watch him, till the warning bell, “‘Death's herald, shall release him from his cell!’ “She said, nor were her orders giv'n in vain; “The miscreants led him by his massive chain— “They left him in his dungeon's dreary hold— “The fatal bell with sound appalling toll'd— “No more! Too much thou'st said,” Chrysulphus cried, “Vengeance, my friends, must now become our guide. “Give it full scope—On Iphimedia's head “Let it an ample retribution shed. “What though the touch of time hath blanch'd my hair— “A soul courageous as your own I bear: “This arm can still sustain my ample shield, “My faulchion still this practis'd hand can wield, “And while life's current animates my heart, “In ev'ry bold emprise I claim a part. “Myself I proffer to conduct you forth, “T'avenge the dead, and succour living worth.” No need for further speech. The chiefs arose, Impatient to proceed against their foes, When young Pisander, whom the loss of blood, Which from his recent wound unheeded flow'd, Had now exhausted, with an aspect wan Sank on the ground. All to his succour ran, All anxious to recal his senses lost, And staunch the streaming blood—Prothenor most. “Hasten,” exclaim'd he, “let some leech be found, “Of skill to aid him, and bind up his wound.” Strait answer'd one who stood amid the throng, “I know the virtues which to herbs belong, “And oft, returning from the battle's field, “Did I to stricken friends assistance yield—” “So yield it now to him,” the king replied, “And may kind Providence thine efforts guide!” Instant Pisander's corslet he unbrac'd, And cautiously the mailed fence displac'd Thro' which the dart had pierc'd; but, when he rais'd The inward vest, as horror-struck he gaz'd, And cried with phrenzied air in accents wild, “'Tis he! thy son! thy long-lamented child! “Thy Artabanes!”—“Heavens!” the king exclaim'd, “My son, my Artabanes hast thou nam'd? “By all that men or angels sacred hold, “The myst'ry which thy words convey unfold.” “First let me,” said he, “at thy royal feet “Forgiveness and thy clemency intreat. “Ah! little thought I, when beneath the blade “Of this brave youth I fell, his pris'ner made, “That I should vindicate his rightful claim, “And prove his high descent and royal name. “List, nobles all, while I my tale pursue, “And heav'n protect me as that tale is true! “I am Plexertes. Some here knew me well, “Ere by a villain's arts seduc'd I fell, “For to my wife the fair Melissa's care “Was giv'n the nurture of Mæonia's heir. “I then was honest—so at least I thought— “But av'rice spread her toils, and I was caught, “Caught by Cresphontes first. The wide domain “Of dead Leucaspion anxious to retain, “And fearing his design would fruitless prove, “Unless he could his orphan'd son remove, “He fix'd on me to perpetrate the deed. “His proffer'd gold seduc'd me; I agreed, “And took the child, but not with the intent “To realize the crime th' usurper meant. “My purpose was to quit Mæonia's shore, “And, while my charge to Mysia's realm I bore, “To hold him safely, as the pledge most sure “To excite his fears and fresh supplies procure. “When av'rice thus had wrought upon my soul, “It soon usurp'd unlimited controul. “Become a stranger to my native home, “An outcast doom'd in foreign climes to roam, “A plan nefarious I devis'd, which now “With shame and deep contrition I avow. “My wife Melissa nurs'd thy infant son: “I tempted her; she yielded—was undone! “Her and the royal babe, when midnight dark “The sky obscur'd, I hurried to my bark. “Holding the heir of proud Mæonia's throne, “Fortune and wealth I fondly deem'd mine own. “But vanish'd soon the visionary hope, “To which vain fancy gave such boundless scope: “A foreign vessel check'd our prosp'rous course; “We fought, were captur'd by superior force; “Melissa, victim of my sordid art, “Sank at my feet—an arrow pierc'd her heart; “From me Leucaspion's heir the victors tore, “And left me stript of all on Mysia's shore. “Dreadful was now my state: all hope was fled, “I knew not where to shroud my guilty head; “A helpless infant stunn'd me with its cry— “I gaz'd upon it with a pitying eye, “And form'd a desp'rate plan. In a lone wood “The lowly cottage of a peasant stood. “I bargain'd for the nurture of thy son: “My ample promises acceptance won. “I left him there, and, to my fate resign'd, “The hardy pirates of Icaria join'd. “Yet, as if influenc'd by some secret sway, “Ere from the peasant's cot I took my way, “With stain, which soon indelible became, “Here on his arm I stamp'd th' initial of his name—” No more paternal piety allow'd: O'er his brave son Prothenor fondly bow'd Who now reviving, as his eyes he rais'd, With tender rev'rence on his father gaz'd. At length the monarch cried, “To bounteous heav'n “First, as of due, be thanks and homage given, “And next to thee, restorer of my child! “Howe'er by error warp'd, by guilt defil'd, “May heav'nly justice pardon thee, as I “Forget thy wrongs and grant thee amnesty. “But, oh ye pow'rs who rule our fates below! “Why were ye thus in your disclosure slow, “Why was I suffer'd, on a vain pretence “Of woe impending, to delude my sense, “To conjure up imaginary fear, “And pang the hearts of those I held most dear? “Oh had I but this blissful day foreseen, “How free from anguish might my life have been! “I had not then, poor wretched man! believ'd “Th' impostor who my cred'lous faith deceiv'd, “Not vainly then my daughter's charms had bloom'd, “By me to cheerless celibacy doom'd. “Ye marvel, chieftains, at my strange discourse. “List then, and trace my errors from their source. CANTO XII. “Long had my reign with happiness been fraught, “And each succeeding year new blessings brought. “I hop'd, how vainly hop'd! indulgent heav'n “A permanency to its gifts had giv'n, “That, when at length my destin'd hour should come, “My wife's, my children's hands should deck my tomb. “Too soon, alas! the flatt'ring vision fled: “My wife, my son, I number'd with the dead. “E'en now I blush to own, though years of care “Have bow'd my feeble limbs and blanch'd my hair, “How then I yielded to misfortune's stroke. “The native vigour of my mind was broke, “And o'er my weak and vacillating soul “With touch benumbing superstition stole; “Dreams, visions, portents, all the fancies wild “By which unsettled reason is beguil'd, “Grew now familiar: how I might avoid “Ills undefin'd alone my thoughts employ'd. “At length, 'twas rumour'd that a sapient wight “Had fix'd his station on the topmost height “Of lofty Sipilus, whence he reveal'd “Secrets from all save from himself conceal'd, “More than the Pythoness e'er brought to view, “Than dread Chimæra hid, or Demogorgon knew. “When of this prodigy I had report, “I crav'd his welcome presence at my court; “But he, well practis'd in his guileful trade, “To my submissive suit no def'rence paid. “‘Those,’ he replied, ‘who wish to learn their doom, “‘Here to consult their oracle must come.’ “This insolence—I own it to my shame— “To my credulity a spur became: “Him, who so lightly my command esteem'd, “Still more deserving of my trust I deem'd, “And urg'd by feelings strange and undefin'd, “To their strong impulse I myself resign'd. “Soon as the night had spread her fav'ring shade, “Unseen by all, in peasant garb array'd, “I left the court, and to the mountain rude, “Seeking the sage, my lonely course pursued. “Its side I mounted as the full-orb'd moon, “By flitting clouds undimm'd, had reach'd her noon, “And still pursued my way, by hope impell'd, “Till on a sudden I a form beheld “Of aspect so uncouth, of garb so strange, “That never fancy in her wildest range “Its prototype had drawn. Haggard his air, “Rough and wide-floating was his sable hair, “His loins a wolf-skin scantily conceal'd, “While his Herculean limbs, to sight reveal'd, “As the moon's trem'lous ray across them gleam'd, “Gigantic, rude, and super-human seem'd. “He strode across the mountain. As he pass'd, “O'er the crush'd heath a shadow dark he cast, “Immeasurably stretch'd, while o'er his head “Their flapping pinions birds ill-omen'd spread, “And shrieks were heard, such as no mortal ear, “E'er listen'd to, or mortal pow'rs could bear. “As I beheld him, troubled grew my brain; “I strove to fly or turn mine eyes—in vain— “For on him still I gaz'd, as if spell-bound, “And still my feet were rooted to the ground. “‘King!’ he exclaim'd in accents loud and hoarse, “‘I know the hidden purpose of thy course. “‘Follow—obey—on yon aërial brow, “‘If firm thy heart, thy fortunes thou shalt know.’ “He said, and fiercely beck'ning led the way. “Submiss I follow'd his resistless sway, “And toiling onwards, as the waning light “Glanc'd on our rugged path, we gain'd the height. “Abrupt he stopt. ‘The spot,’ he cried, ‘behold, “‘Where his behest shall destiny unfold. “‘Docile and mute his sov'reign will await, “‘While I invoke the ministers of fate.’ “Awe-struck, from his soul-searching eye I shrank, “And on my guilty knee obedient sank; “While from the greensward snatching up his wand, “And mutt'ring sounds obscure, with cautious hand “Near me a circuit wide the wizard trac'd. “As thrice with measur'd steps its round he pac'd, “More fierce his air became, more wild his eye, “Now downwards cast, now fix'd on vacancy, “While as aloft his potent wand he rear'd, “Mists veil'd the sky, no more the moon appear'd, “With sudden tremor rock'd the solid ground, “And shriller shrieks soul-harrowing burst around. “As kneeling still I gaz'd, a crash, more loud “Than thunder pealing from a sulph'rous cloud, “Mine ear assail'd, more dense the darkness grew; “Sudden, a quiv'ring flame of livid hue “Shot from the circle's centre. As it spread, “A dim funereal light around it shed, “While thro' its glare, on which were chain'd mine eyes, “Slowly I saw a massive altar rise. “‘Firm is the charm,’ exclaim'd the madd'ning seer. “‘The mighty master comes—His mandate hear. “‘Him to propitiate who directs thy fate, “‘A fitting sacrifice I invocate. “‘By the dread name, which hell obeys and earth, “‘I charge thee, victim, instantly come forth!’ “Convulsion shook the earth as thus he spoke, “New lightnings flash'd, and louder thunders broke. “A scaly serpent at his call appear'd. “Slowly on high its lengthen'd folds it rear'd, “Writhing and curling back, impress'd with dread, “And turning ruefully its crested head, “Till at th' enchanter's voice and potent wand, “Whose mast'ring sway he could no more withstand, “With desp'rate bound the altar's top it gain'd, “Where closely coil'd and trembling it remain'd. “A faulchion bright the wizard now reveal'd, “Which yet his wolfine girdle had conceal'd, “And with a stroke the serpent clove in twain. “As gush'd the blood from ev'ry sever'd vein, “A wreath, of aconite and hemlock wrought, “With eager haste and phrenzied air he caught, “And, plunging deep in the still reeking gore, “To me the trophy venom-charg'd he bore. “Fiercely he smil'd, and plac'd it on my brow. “I felt the cold drops down my temples flow, “And shudder'd with disgust; my sick'ning soul “Recoil'd, and faintness o'er my members stole, “When, from the blazing altar's pitchy smoke, “Huge, undefin'd, a form horrific broke. “‘Give me my prey!’ a hideous voice exclaim'd, “While to the skies the circling eddies flam'd: “And forth he stretch'd a dread and shadowy arm, “Which seiz'd the bleeding snake, and clos'd the charm; “Within his jaws the sever'd head he bore, “And crush'd the solid bone, and lapp'd the gore. “‘'Tis done!’ he cried in thunders on mine ear. “‘List, king! and destiny's dark mandate hear. “‘Still, still to thee two virgin babes remain: “‘Guard, guard them well, though thou may'st guard in vain; “‘For if to mortal man their fate be tied, “‘Lost Artabanes, by each trembling bride “‘Appearing, shall one common doom abide!’ “No more I heard: for overcome with dread “I sank to earth, my tortur'd senses fled. “Now glow'd the east with morn's reviving ray, “And gentle breezes usher'd in the day. “Wak'd by the birds their early peal that sang, “From my low couch of mossy turf I sprang, “And gaz'd around me. Far as eye could reach, “I saw a barren plain around me stretch, “To which a narrow path, rugged and dread, “Down the declivity abruptly led. “Instant, the scene which had my soul appall'd “Mem'ry, too faithful to its trust, recall'd; “The mountain's brow, the path through which I came, “The turf on which I stood, appear'd the same; “All else was gone—no altar met mine eye, “No circled space, no wizard could I spy. “As doubtfully upon the spot I gaz'd, “My hand unconscious to my brow I rais'd. “Its touch a cold and clammy moisture met. “In haste I drew it back—with blood 'twas wet— “Th' empoison'd chaplet from my brow I tore, “The gift of demons, dripping yet with gore, “And, turning from the spot accurs'd, in haste, “Ere rose the sun, my homeward progress trac'd. “Years follow'd years, and still recurr'd my thought “To the strange horrors which the wizard wrought. “As of my son no tidings I could hear, “To my torn heart my daughters grew more dear, “And fearful doubts and apprehensions dire “The vision's words prophetic would inspire. “When by degrees improv'd their youthful charms, “My anxious soul was fill'd with new alarms: “For now their beauty's fame around was spread, “And many a gallant suitor hither led; “But each illustrious candidate appear'd “Destin'd to realize the ills I fear'd. “Ideal dread subdued my weaken'd soul; “I bent to superstition's dire controul: “I made my daughters breathe a solemn vow “That man's addresses they would ne'er allow—” “High heav'n be prais'd!” Alcimedon exclaim'd, While joy his cheek and sparkling eye inflam'd, “The myst'ry which my fate involv'd is known, “The fair Hermilia now may be mine own, “Thy long lost son may at the altar stand, “And place in mine the trembling fair one's hand! “Oh that this recognition blest might bring “An equal share of bliss to Mysia's king!”— “Ere long, I trust,” Mæonia's monarch cried, “Thy gallant efforts will his fate decide. “Meantime, brave prince, thy suit I gladly hail: “Plead well thy cause, and happily prevail. “Call forth my daughters! bid them here repair; “Our unexpected transport let them share, “Let them their new found brother fondly greet, “And make their father's happiness complete.” Now crowded round Pisander each brave knight, In courteous phrase expressing his delight, When, pale and trembling, with distracted air And hurried step, rush'd in Hermilia fair. “She's gone, she's gone!” exclaim'd the weeping maid, “This letter, by a hand unknown convey'd— “Oh Chariclea, dear, lamented! why, “Why rush thus blindly on thy destiny!” O'er the mov'd king a shudd'ring terror stole. With trembling hands he op'd the fatal scroll— “Oh ye, whom haply I may ne'er review, “My sire, my sister, take my last adieu! “To Orosmanes' suit though deaf I prov'd, “I did full justice to his worth—I lov'd! “My hero from impending death to save, “What fate decrees I self-devoted brave—” Dropping the scroll, in silent woe he stood, While from his eyes forth gush'd a briny flood. The pitying chiefs, who in his grief partook, Their preparations instantly forsook, And, circling round him, sought with tend'rest care To calm the transports of his wild despair. At length spoke Caria's king: “To sooth the pain “Which wrings thy bosom were an effort vain; “For sorrow will its course allotted take, “And fond remembrances will still awake. “Yet, though severe the pang that rends thy heart, “Heav'n, which infix'd it, can relief impart. “Already is its gracious work begun: “Behold thy lost, thy long lamented son! “Thy daughter may be sav'd. In her defence, “The champions of her life, we hasten hence: “No rampir'd walls our efforts shall oppose, “No deadly engines, no embattled foes—” Him interrupting, thus Plexertes cried: “If ye can, princes, in my faith confide, “Myself I proffer as your surest guide. “The walls are crowded by a watchful guard, “And all exterior access strictly barr'd; “But from the moat which circuits round their base, “A secret passage 'twas my lot to trace, “Which bushes hide, and tangling brakes o'erspread: “I pass'd it—to the dungeon's court it led. “Thus safely, princes, may ye entrance gain, “And, if heav'n will, complete success obtain.” No more—for now arose exulting cries, And mingled shouts of transport rent the skies; Forth rush'd the chiefs with glowing hopes inspir'd, While with his son Mæonia's king retir'd. And now, in order rang'd stood ev'ry band, Expectant of the Carian king's command. Nor long the vet'ran his approach delay'd: In splendid armour at all points array'd, Vig'rous though old, still emulous of fame, Attended by Mæonia's king he came. The time brook'd no delay, the eve had clos'd, In gloom propitious all around repos'd. Briefly his will he spoke: with ardour fir'd The practis'd militants no more requir'd; And now throughout the line, from rear to van, The word “To march!” in swift progression ran, When with a shout that made the welkin ring, Before them rush'd half breathless Mysia's king. “Welcome!” exclaim'd he, “welcome brave compeers! “How my glad soul your wish'd-for presence cheers! “Behold me once again from thraldom free, “Master once more of life and liberty. “'Tis heav'n's blest boon—when in my dungeon pent, “A succouring angel to mine aid was sent—” “Where is my child!” Prothenor loudly cried, “The solace of mine age, her sex's pride, “My darling Chariclea?”—“She!—Thy child! Exclaim'd the Mysian king with aspect wild— “What mean'st thou?—Chariclea!—Speak—Impart, “Some consolation to my tortur'd heart— “Why heave those sighs? Adown thy cheeks why roll “Those tears of anguish? Why stretch forth that scroll? “Give me to view it”—With a look aghast On its content a rapid glance he cast. Fast clench'd he grasp'd it; trembled ev'ry limb; With horror rose his hair; his eyes grew dim: “And mad'st thou,” cried he, as with bended knee To earth he bow'd, “this sacrifice for me? “Oh unexampled love! too long conceal'd “And now, alas, too fatally reveal'd! “Wretch that I was! To my responsive heart “Could not thy accents sympathy impart, “Could I unfeeling of thy touch remain, “When with a trembling hand thou loos'st my chain? “Oh gen'rous warriors! if your noble souls “Or pity moves or chivalry controuls, “Aid me to rescue her! At glory's call, “Dare ev'ry peril, scale with me yon wall! “Where art thou, brother? Aracynthus where! “Oh! come, and minister to my despair!” “Alas! my friend,” Alcimedon replied, “The fatal truth we may not, cannot hide. “Bear firmly that I cannot firmly tell— “To rescue thee thine Aracynthus fell!” As when discursive on his pinion light, Some lordly falcon takes his vig'rous flight, If from the twanging bow a barbed dart With destination sure transfix his heart, Headlong he falls—So Orosmanes sank, Soon as his ears the dreadful tidings drank. All colour from his haggard visage fled; No sigh he heav'd, no tear of anguish shed, But his fix'd eye-balls, with appalling glare, Gave fearful token of his wild despair. “Arouse thee,” cried Alcimedon, “awake “For great revenge and Chariclea's sake! “The moments, well employ'd for her relief, “Consume not thus in unavailing grief. “Think what on thee the gen'rous suff'rer's claim! “Her life, her honour, her untainted fame, “Thy love, thy gratitude, thy glory, all “Imperiously for prompt exertion call. “On to the proof, my friend! Thy cause is our's: “Together will we scale those rampir'd tow'rs, “Where impious force the royal maid detains, “Where Aracynthus' blood their pavement stains. “There, when the crimson'd battlements we scale, “His conscious spirit shall our ardour hail, “Mid hosts angelic on our efforts smile, “And crown with vict'ry our illustrious toil!” Instant the clarion's pealing note was heard; High in the breeze each banner proud was rear'd. No word spake Orosmanes. With an air Of settled agony and fix'd despair, He follow'd Caria's king, who to the head Of the bold host his sad companion led, And gave command to march; when lo! a cry From their compacted cohorts rent the sky— “To great revenge and Chariclea's aid!” He heard, he started, and no longer stay'd. Waving his faulchion, to the ardent line Of quicken'd speed he gave the welcome sign, And, with the port of angry Mars, in haste His desp'rate progress to Larissa trac'd. High on her sumptuous throne, in royal state, By conquest crown'd, with flatt'ring hope elate, Repos'd Bithynia's queen. Her splendid board With all that luxury could crave was stor'd; The dulcet flute, the harp's enlivening note Her ear with harmony enchanting smote, While intermingling voices sweetly sung The charms of Bacchus ever fair and young, Or her who, springing from the frothy main, O'er love and pleasure holds despotic reign. Above the rest, as foremost in her grace, On her right hand Hyperbius held his place, With ivy chaplet crown'd his scowling brows. He bad the not unwilling chiefs carouse, And, as the cup with juice nectareous fraught With air commanding in his grasp he caught, “To the great queen,” he cried, “be pow'r, be praise! “To her, brave chiefs, the song triumphant raise: “Drain your deep goblets, and your toast proclaim— “Her health, prosperity, and deathless fame!” They heard him, and obey'd: with one accord And simultaneous zeal they gave the word, Rais'd their full goblets, and the sparkling draught To Iphimedia's health and glory quaff'd. With conscious pride arose Bithynia's queen. Smooth was her brow, and gracious was her mien, As, bending to each adulating guest, She thus with winning smiles the band address'd. “Thanks, val'rous chieftains! your approval high “Adds a superior zest to victory. “Lords! Satraps! Princes! for no meaner names “Shall henceforth decorate your rightful claims, “To you, whose zeal this vanquish'd kingdom shook, “For still more splendid services I look. “Bithynia's and Mæonia's crowns are mine: “To these Armenia, Mysia, Caria join, “Let their weak sov'reigns, crouching at my feet, “For pity supplicate, for life intreat, “While on their walls my banners are unfurl'd, “And I am empress hail'd of Asia's world. “Then tax my gratitude—Whate'er my pow'r “Of honour, wealth, pre-eminence can show'r, “Whate'er may best your services requite, “Claim, and assert as your undoubted right. “Now let me pledge the loyal toast ye gave— “To ev'ry gallant chief and warrior brave “Make I libation free of gen'rous wine, “And health, prosperity, and joy propine. “Let the bright beverage sparkle in my cup! “Fill high, my best Hyperbius, fill it up!” She said; nor stay'd he to obey her word. Through the wide hall the choral song was heard, The high roof echo'd with the pealing strain For Iphimedia's long and happy reign, When from a flagon, amply stor'd with juice Richest of all that Naxian hills produce, Which stood conspicuous on the festive board, As its contents into her cup he pour'd, And its brim circled with a perfum'd wreath, He mingled secretly the draught of death. From the dark pent-house of his brow he rais'd His anxious eye, and on the princess gaz'd, As the dire compound in her hand she took. Smiling, her guests she pledg'd, and, with a look Which spoke th' exulting transport of her soul, High to her lips she rais'd, and drain'd the fatal bowl. “And now,” cried she, “each leader to his post: “Let each inspect and organise his host; “For, when to-morrow's sun shall gild the sky, “We from Prothenor may expect reply. “On thee, Hyperbius! chiefly I repose; “Thou shar'st my councils, thy experience knows “All that is needful. Be thy best zeal shewn, “Friend of my life, supporter of my throne!” “Experience past may prove,” Hyperbius cried, “That not on me thou vainly hast relied. “Still watchful for thy good, with zeal unsought “Have I to vantage thy best int'rests wrought, “And my last act, so fav'ring fortune will'd, “Hath still more fully my intent fulfill'd. “Rest now in peace; bid long adieu to care; “For the conclusion of thy toils prepare: “The hour's at hand, when in a long repose “Thou shalt all mem'ry of past troubles lose.” Thus saying, with his Saracenic crew With more than custom'd def'rence he withdrew. Alone remain'd the queen. As some gay rose, When its fresh buds their op'ning charms disclose, With dawn's mild fragrance mingles rich perfumes, Unconscious of the canker which consumes Its source of life, so fill'd with flatt'ring hope She gave to visionary bliss free scope; High beat her heart as fancy's course she trac'd, New crowns her head, her hand new sceptres grac'd. Still her soul wanton'd with the pleasing theme, When a guard ent'ring chas'd her airy dream. “A holy monk,” said he, “of rev'rend mien, “Craves instant audience of Bithynia's queen.” “On monks,” cried she, “can I my time bestow? “Hence to his convent let the dotard go, “And, as he tells his beads and matins sings, “Let his saints teach the def'rence due to kings!” “Of high import,” the trembling guard replied, “His mission is, and may not be denied. “I had refus'd him entrance, but he said “From Zulphis he intelligence convey'd.” “Admit him instantly,” cried she. “Away! “Concerns like this allow not of delay.” A monk, who seem'd by age or weakness bent, Slowly advanc'd. Upon a staff he leant, An ample cowl his face conceal'd from view, And oft he paus'd as tow'rds the queen he drew. As with fix'd eyes upon his form she gaz'd, Trembling, the cowl which veil'd his face he rais'd, Loos'd was the knotted cord which zon'd his breast, Aside was cast his dark monastic vest— With ev'ry charm that can adorn her sex, With ev'ry grace that peerless beauty decks, While from her eyes distill'd a briny flood, A young and blushing maid before her stood! “A woman!” cried the queen in wild surprise, “What brings thee hither? Wherefore this disguise?” “A wretch I am,” replied the sorrowing fair, “Lost to all hope, and victim of despair; “Once blest by fate, by Aracynthus lov'd, “Our union by my royal sire approv'd—” “So then,” exclaim'd the queen, “at last I see “The minion, guider of his destiny! “What in that fragile form, that baby face, “Could eyes like his of fascination trace? “A rival thou!—Aye, weep thyself to stone; “Thy loves, thy lover, are for ever gone!” “I know it,” steadily the fair replied, “And now despair must be my only guide. “Thou'st heard th' avowal of our mutual flame: “Now list, when I myself Zapheria name, “Daughter of him the Carian crown who wears. “His anguish and my lov'd Aspasia's tears “I witness'd, when thy cruel herald spoke “The mandate which her soul's attachment broke. “Judge then with what delight my bosom glow'd, “When on Artaces she her hand bestow'd—” “His spouse! I caution thee that word unsay, “Or Orosmanes shall the forfeit pay.” “Thank heav'n! beyond thy menace is her fate, “And haply Mysia's king may 'scape thy hate. “For me, whate'er the pangs my heart which rend, “At once my painful mission I must end. “Away then ev'ry fear! Thine angry brow, “Thy lightning eye are unavailing now. “Enthron'd in bliss, above yon starry pole, “My Aracynthus fortifies my soul, “Bids me like him devote myself, and prove “How well I merited a hero's love. “He now is lost, for ever, ever gone— “My will, my actions, are become mine own. “Pledg'd for the life of Orosmanes stands “Thy sacred word. I claim it at thy hands. “Him, who aspir'd to my Aspasia, name. “If, in her stead, my votive hand he claim, “Slave to my duty, to my fate resign'd, “In me a willing victim shalt thou find.” “Before on what thou say'st I can decide, “Brief council must I hold,” the queen replied. “I leave thee for a while. Here patient wait, “Till I pronounce on thine and Orosmanes' fate.” She said, and left her. “And can guilt thus wear,” Zapheria sighing said, “a form so fair? “Alas for pity, that a seraph's grace “Should clothe a soul so dissolute, so base! “But wherefore rests my froward thought on one, “So lost to good, so ev'ry way undone? “In its own hour, on her devoted head “An ample retribution heav'n will shed. “To that I leave her. Far beyond her pow'r, “Great though it be, my thoughts aspiring tow'r, “To thee, now wafted to thy kindred skies, “To thee, my Aracynthus! they arise. “Oh! for a while celestial joys forego, “Let my torn bosom with thine influence glow, “Call forth each virtuous energy, impart “A more than female courage to my heart, “Sanction the sacrifice I make for thee, “Aid me to hail thy Orosmanes free; “Then, at the hateful altar as I stand, “Brace ev'ry nerve, confirm my erring hand, “Direct this poniard to the deep retreat “Of ebbing life, let my last pulses beat “Faithful to thee: then to those realms above, “Where dwell immortal purity and love, “Let thy approving spirit be my guide, “Alike in life or death thy constant bride!” She said. Her eyes in holy rapture rais'd, On heav'n, where lay her treasur'd hope, she gaz'd. On his lov'd image as repos'd her thought, Her speaking features its reflection caught, A more than human grace her form assum'd, A chaste and holy fire her eyes illum'd; She look'd as if, her painful ordeal o'er, She had already reach'd the blissful shore, Where hopes and fears no longer pang the breast, But all is transport, certainty, and rest. Soon an approaching step dispell'd her trance. She turn'd to meet the haughty queen's advance. Of passion still her brow retain'd the trace, A smile of dubious import lit her face, And heav'd with more than 'custom'd force her breast, As thus the suff'ring mourner she address'd. “Behold the peer, who in my sov'reign grace “Of those who fill my court holds primest place, “On whose behalf I proffer'd my demand. “Receive him as the suitor for thine hand.” She said; and lo! advancing from the gate Hyperbius, object of her deadliest hate, The trembling maid beheld. Approaching nigh In vain he thrice essay'd to raise his eye, Which, as by some unknown enchantment bound, Remain'd fast rivetted upon the ground. Shudd'ring she view'd him as he silent stood; But, ere he could resume his 'custom'd mood, Her soul, by thoughts and guilt like his unstain'd, Its wonted equanimity regain'd. With conscious dignity her visage gleam'd, Her eyes with virtue's heav'nly radiance beam'd, As with a glance which proud contempt convey'd, To Iphimedia thus she firmly said. “I come not here to parley or debate, “But bow to fortune, and submit to fate. “Let me behold the Mysian monarch free, “Then of Zapheria as thou will'st decree.” “Fair princess, hear,” Hyperbius humbly cried; “If I aspire to hail thee as my bride, “Concede the boon which I with def'rence crave. “Of thy perfections the admiring slave—” “Cease,” she exclaim'd; “Though I resign my hand, “My mind, my thoughts, my will I still command. “Lost as thou art to honour and to fame, “Branded by guilt and stigmatis'd by shame, “Dare thy presumptuous hope to me ascend, “The daughter of thine injur'd king, thy friend?” “Thou talk'st it bravely,” said Bithynia's queen; “How thou can'st act will shortly now be seen. “Call to our presence Myron! Let him bring “From his close ward the captive Mysian king.” Meantime Hyperbius oft the chamber pac'd, While sullenly his projects dark he trac'd, His soul on meditated evil bent. Oft from beneath his louring eye he sent A rapid glance of observation keen, Noting if yet in the imperious queen He might some trace discover of the draught, Which from his hand she unsuspecting quaff'd. Nor vain his impious hope. Her wand'ring eye, Her frequent start, her cheek of crimson'd dye, Gave proof convincing that the deadly flood Was intermingling with her vital blood. Nor slight the pangs which she by fits sustain'd: Yet, as they pass'd, her firmness she regain'd, And, still by hope and confidence beguil'd, With cheering look on her assassin smil'd, And bad him greet the lovely maid, whose charms, In fate's despite, so soon would bless his arms, When sudden, with an air that dread express'd, Myron rush'd in, and thus the queen address'd. “Pardon, oh pardon! I am not to blame, “Some mischief-working demon surely came, “And his close fetters broke—The doors were fast”— “Art mad! What mean'st thou?” cried the queen aghast, “Who's gone? Not Mysia's king?”—“Alas! 'tis he— “Let not thy royal censure fall on me”— “How 'scap'd he? Who did his evasion aid?”— “I found a youth upon his pallet laid”— “Bring him here instantly!” with eyes inflam'd And varying countenance the queen exclaim'd: For now the philtre work'd through ev'ry vein, Crept to her heart, and mounted to her brain, While she, unconscious of the fatal strife Which its fell venom held with waning life, Though sharper grew the pangs which rack'd her breast, No demonstration gave, no plaint express'd, But on a couch reclin'd, with haughty frown Waited th' arrival of the youth unknown. With what astonishment was mark'd each brow, As with a port majestic, firm, and slow, Fair Chariclea from the gate advanc'd! A look of scorn upon the queen she glanc'd, As with an air serene and graceful pride Thus with an accent of command she cried. “Ask'st thou by whom was wrought the glorious deed, “By whose bold act was Orosmanes freed? “Know it was I who loos'd the captive's chain, “Who render'd thy inhuman projects vain, “Who, in despite of all thine arts abhorr'd, “The hero to his sorrowing friends restor'd. “Now on my head let thy worst vengeance fall! “Invent new torments! I defy them all. “Look on me, queen! Mark o'er thy boasted pow'rs “How proudly heav'n protected virtue tow'rs. “A simple maid, unaided and alone, “Dares blood-stain'd guilt though seated on its throne, “Points to yon heav'n, before whose judgment seat “Th' oppressor and th' oppress'd shall surely meet. “To that tribunal make I my appeal. “Do'st tremble haughty queen? Can'st thou then feel? “Doth conscience 'wake? Oh! to its voice attend, “In life thy shield, in death thy only friend.— “But why that eager look—that sudden start? “Why heaves thy panting breast? Why throbs thy heart? “Convulsions shake thy frame—The fearful glare “Of madness flashes in thy ghastly stare”— As thus she said, o'er the rack'd suff'rer's cheek A livid palenes stole—with piteous shriek Her head she rais'd—with spasm terrific shrank Her wild distorted face—again she sank— Her stiff'ning limbs convulsive tremors shook, She shriek'd again, and life her blacken'd form forsook. “'Tis done! Thy fate is fix'd!” with smile malign Hyperbius cried. “Bithynia's crown is mine! “Oh brave elixir! that so small a drop “The pulse of that imperious heart should stop, “Such limbs transmute to dust, such flesh to clay, “And leave them to the charnel worm a prey! “But come, thou golden circlet, proud ensign “Of her past sov'reignty, and now of mine, “Thou talisman, within whose orbit lie “The pomps and attributes of royalty, “Rest on my brow! Now may ambitious hope “With uncheck'd pinion take her boldest scope; “Now on more equal terms, too scornful fair, “I bid thee in my new dominions share”— “Monster, avaunt!” th' indignant maid replied, “Hence from my presence! In some desert hide “Thy damning guilt; with savage beasts, who roam “Through pathless wilds, seek thine appropriate home! “Let not a murd'rer's touch my hand defile! “Nor threats can daunt me, nor thine arts beguile.” “Thou hast thy privilege,” said he; “rail on! “Soon will the function of the priest be done; “His magic words thy fury will allay, “And teach thee whom to honour and obey. “Advance, thou holy minister! Thy skill “Must bend this stubborn beauty to my will, “Appease the storm which ruffles that fair face, “And deck that countenance with novel grace. “Yet wait a moment—My capacious soul “Disdains a part when it may grasp the whole. “I must have witness to this sacred rite: “There is a certain friend I would invite, “One who knows thee, and whom thou know'st full well. “Bring hither Aracynthus from his cell!” “Immortal pow'rs! Doth then my hero live? “Prove it but true, and I will all forgive. “Or—for my heart misgives me—is't a lie, “Coin'd in deep hell my constancy to try? “Speak—If thy bosom can compassion feel, “Oh speak! The dreaded certainty reveal!” “Perchance that lady-youth,” replied he, “knows; “If not, here's one who can the truth disclose. “Enter, heroic prince!—Whence this surprise? “What means that start, those wildly staring eyes? “Trust me no phantoms here before them glide— “'Tis real all—That's thy affianc'd bride— “Thou com'st no nearer—Is thy faith so scant, “Thou wilt not credence to assurance grant? “If so, I pray thee give it ampler rein. “I've that to tell which thy belief may strain. “That lady, to thy merits strangely blind, “To me, Hyperbius, hath her hand resign'd.” “Believe him not,” she eagerly exclaim'd; “Art thou not, base calumniator! asham'd? “The very demon, who the falsehood bred, “Had blush'd, and from my injur'd presence fled. “No Aracynthus! this fond heart of mine, “Constant as holy faith, still, still is thine. “My soul, my lips, renounce the change accurs'd. “Let yon blood-stain'd assassin do his worst: “E'en at the altar, if he drag me there, “I bear a charm, which shall assist despair— “This precious dagger—'Tis my sure resource; “Heav'n to his heart or mine shall guide its course.” “Not yet,” replied he, as the steel she clench'd With over-pow'ring violence he wrench'd, “Not yet—When full satiety shall come, “Thou may'st with licence free provoke thy doom. “Meantime, to pleasure me thy life retain. “And thou—What makes thee silent thus remain? “I look'd to hear a storm of passion break, “To see thy limbs with fury's tempest shake: “Thine apathy my triumph half destroys, “And throws a damp on my expected joys. “What says the hero? Will he tamely see “His lovely princess plight her faith to me?” “Dar'st thou, mean dastard!” cried th' indignant youth, “Impeach her matchless purity and truth? “Think'st thou that heav'n, to which her pray'rs ascend, “Will not insulted innocence defend! “What though this arm, confin'd by massy chains, “No more th' angelic sufferer sustains, “There is an over-ruling pow'r, whose hand “Can all thy impious menaces withstand, “Frustrate thy plans accurs'd, and turn the dart “Thou aim'st 'gainst others to thy harden'd heart. “That confidence, e'en now, my soul can cheer. “He, who fears heav'n, can know no other fear.” It may be objected to this line, that it is borrowed from the Athalie of Racine, being nearly a direct translation of the celebrated passage, “Je crains Dieu, cher Abner, et n'ai point d'autre crainte.” The Author, however, while he admits the charge, conceives that no apology can be thought necessary. A sentiment so true, and so dignified, cannot be too often repeated, or too forcibly brought home to the heart and understanding of the reader. “Fear whom or what thou will'st, my firmer heart,” Replied he, “at no puny dread can start. “I'll give thee present proof no idle tale “Of heav'n or hell my daring soul can quail. “Come on, Sir Priest! Begin—There shalt thou stand, “While he confirms to me her plighted hand, “Shalt be spectator of the bridal kiss, “The happy prelude to my coming bliss. “My soul is all on fire, and ev'ry sense “Is strain'd to extacy—Come, priest! commence.” He said. The priest advancing op'd his book: When sudden shouts arose, the hall which shook; The clank of arms was heard—A giant stroke The solid portal into fragments broke— In rush'd the princely band from Zulphis led, With valiant Orosmanes at its head. “Hold!” with imperious voice Hyperbius cried, As with one hand he grasp'd his victim bride, And with a resolute and fiend-like air His high-pois'd dagger aim'd against the fair. “Dare not approach me—Instantly depart— “Hence—or I plunge this weapon in her heart!” As yet he spoke, with one convulsive strain Brave Aracynthus burst his circling chain. Sudden, with more than human ardour fraught, The desp'rate miscreant's up-rais'd hand he caught, Seiz'd the fell blade, and with such vigour smote, That thrice he plung'd it in his swelling throat Ere to the ground he fell. Forth gush'd his blood, And his soul issued with the crimson'd flood. The victor caught Zapheria to his breast— Let fancy paint, and feelings speak the rest! FINIS.</field>
