      <field name="fulltext">[Let others sing of water-falls] Let others sing of water-falls That streak with white the mountain-walls; Or mighty rivers, on whose tide The navies of all nations glide. But I have found a simpler theme In following the fenland stream, That winds 'mid quiet fields away, Where lilies live and children play. BY THE RIVER. She has taken her book To the river-side: At her favourite page It opened wide. It is dull, she said, In the house to-day; And I have no one To help me play. And the butterflies They fly too fast: And I tumbled down When I caught the last. But here by the river 'Tis nice to sit, And read a little, Then think a bit. While the swallows sweep On dark blue wings, And the fishes rise In widening rings. And the water-lilies Laugh in my face, And the tall reeds curtsey With courtly grace. And all the creatures, And all the flowers, Say—This little girl Is a sister of ours! WHAT THE FROG SAW. A wise old frog sat under a reed Where the river winds away: “Good even!” said he: “Good even!” said I, “And what have you seen to-day?” “This morning I saw six eggs,” said he, “Where the river winds away: And now there are six little ducks,” said he, “All in the river at play.” THE LILIES. What do the lilies hear, That makes them look so gay, As they lie and listen, where the broad leaves glisten, And the great green rushes sway? They hear the mill-wheel lathering Thro' the bright and busy hours; And the laugh of the children gathering The golden meadow-flowers. But at even all is silence, And the lilies hide themselves; And are hushed to sleep in the waters deep By the whispering water-elves. TRESPASSING. “How I wonder what is meant By that long word ‘prosecuted’! What would happen, if I went In there, where the paling's bent? Perhaps it's some grand punishment To grown-up people suited.” Little Maggie looked and sighed; Nobody was there to see her; The opening was so nice and wide, She could squeeze through if she tried: Soon she found herself inside, Naughtier but freer. Oh, she gathered flowers of gold, And she gathered flowers of white, Gathered all her arms could hold; Nobody came near to scold; She grew bolder and more bold, And ventured in outright. Suddenly two necks of snow From the long reeds hissing rose; Two great wings flapped to and fro, Terrified poor Maggie so, That in haste she turned to go From such fearful foes. Help or harbour saw she none, And the long grass caught her feet, And she tried in vain to run; All her little breath was done; All her flowers dropped one by one In her wild retreat. Safe at last! oh joy! to cling To loving arms, as she saluted Thus her mother wondering: “Oh mother, mother, such a thing Has happened! I've been trespassing, And oh! so near got prosecuted!” THE BOY AND THE FISHES. There was a little urchin, Who tried to pull a perch in, All by himself one day; But the line went crack, And sent him on his back, And the perch swam peacefully away. But the perch swam about, With the fish-hook in his snout, Which all his brother perches thought so fine, That they went swim, swim, To get a hook like him; And the boy had soon another on his line. YELLOW FLAGS. Oh, what a lovely flower, Yellow like gold! It is just like a fairy's bower, Where the petals fold. And the dragon-fly is the fairy: It was sitting here, With its gauzy wings so airy, Till I came near. I wish in my lesson-hours, For an exercise, I might learn the language of flowers And of dragon-flies! For then when I came near them, If they saw it was me, They would stay and let me hear them Talking quite free. AN INVITATION. Little fishes, little fishes, Won't you listen to our wishes? Come, come, come, and bite! Pull the float down out of sight! Don't you find it dull down there? Only water everywhere! Never anyone to talk to, Only just one way to walk, too! Here it's much more interesting; I know where a lark is nesting, Over there among the broom; And the cowslips are in bloom. And so fast the hay is growing, It will soon be ripe for mowing. There's such lots of fun about: Won't you let me help you out? YOUTH AND BEAUTY. Piggy-wig, O Piggy-wig! What a pity One so pretty Must grow ugly, old and big! Grunting, squeaking, Almost speaking, With your black coat brushed so neatly, And your pink nose turned up sweetly, I could really Kiss you—nearly. Piggy-wig, O Piggy-wig! What a pity One so pretty Must grow ugly, old and big! MAUD AND MARJORIE. Maud and Marjorie Out in the meadows, Playing in the sunshine, Chasing the shadows. Running, romping, racing, Like two young fillies.— “Look,” cried Marjorie, “Look, what lovely lilies! “Let's make a chain of them, As if they were daisies!” Marjorie makes the chain, Maud sits and gazes. They tie themselves together With the lily-chain pliant; Pretend they're prisoners, Taken by a giant. Pretend the chain is iron,— So the giant's cruel will is,— Till a kind, lovely fairy Turns it into lilies. THE THREE PRINCESSES. At home in Father's garden There grows an apple tree; Where the children play at being Princesses, one, two, three. “Look!” says one, “The morning Is already come!” “Hark!” the next one answers, “I can hear the drum!” “Listen!” cries the last one, “'Tis the gallant knight Who for our deliverance Marches to the fight. “If he win the battle, He will marry me; Let him win or lose it, He's the knight for me!” Adapted from the French. WATER-RATS. Brother rat By brother sat, Far away from dry land; A lily leaf Their coral reef, Or, rather, floating island. There laugh they at The coward cat Who dare not cross the water. Safe sitting so They fear no foe, Nor risk of sudden slaughter. The food they eat Is grasses sweet: Nor rick nor barn they ravage; This harmless folk No hate provoke, Nor persecution savage. However wet Their feet may get They change not shoe nor stocking; In furs all day They swim or play, And no one thinks it shocking. THE DESERTED HOUSE. Nobody lives here now! The wind and rain Come driving through the broken pane, Nobody minding how. Mother told me once a story, Which she said was simple truth, How an old man grey and hoary, Who had run away in youth, Came back to this house one day From a country far away. But he found the house left lonely, And the garden, once so neat, Overgrown with weeds; and only As it used to be, this seat. And he sat here, till the day Faded in the West away. Suddenly he saw before him Someone coming to the place, And a wondrous joy came o'er him, When he saw the woman's face. She was wrinkled, old and grey, But he knew her face that day. And he knew she was his sister, And he called her by her name, Took her in his arms and kissed her; And she told him how she came From the almshouse every day To that seat, for him to pray. Mother said they lived together In this cottage till they died; Then 'twas left to wind and weather. In the churchyard side by side They are sleeping, and their green Grassy graves may yet be seen. So nobody lives here now! The wind and rain Come driving through the broken pane, Nobody minding how. JESSIE'S STORY. One Summer day, when the wind blew soft, Willie had tied his kite in the croft. Up, up it flew, till it went so high, I thought it wanted to touch the sky. It tugged and pulled like a living thing; I was sorry for it, and undid the string. But it didn't do what I meant at all, For over it turned, and began to fall. I called to Willie, and off we ran; (It was out of sight before we began.) Across the meadow, and through the hedge, And down the slope to the river's edge. And there in the rushes, a sad, sad sight, Broken and torn lay the beautiful kite. And Willie wasn't angry, because He saw how dreadfully sorry I was. And as we went home, he explained to me Why kites and things don't do to be free. DREAMING. Does she float in her dreams Down more wonderful streams, Where the lilies are silver and gold, And the green rushy places Are full of bright faces Of fairies delightfully bold? Though the lilies she'd far Rather have as they are, And the river might be just the same, And of fairies, sweet maid, She's a wee bit afraid,— Oh! if only the fishes were tame! And the fishes below, As they swim to and fro, Do they come when she calls them, and take The crumbs from her hand, As the birds do on land?— Oh, dear! what a pity to wake! WHAT THE REED-WARBLER SANG. Two little children, weaving knots Of daisies and forget-me-nots, Among the river reeds they heard Twitter, twitter, a tiny bird. “Tweet, Tweet! Life is sweet; Life is gay; Work is play; Play is work; Nought doth irk. “Leaf and feather All together I entwine Without rest, All to line My soft nest.” Something like this it seemed to say, And the children answered it in play. “Tweet, Tweet! Life is sweet; Life is gay; Work is play; Play is work; Nought doth irk. “Leaf and flower, Hour by hour We entwine Just for play, On our fine Holiday.” LOTTIE AND DOTTIE. THE LITTLE GIRL SPEAKS: I am Lottie: This is Dottie; He's my very, very own; He's the saddest, Prettiest, baddest, Dearest doggie ever known. THE LITTLE DOG SPEAKS: I am Dottie: This is Lottie; She gives me food, and keeps me clean; She's the haughtiest, Prettiest, naughtiest, Dearest mistress ever seen. GOING TO THE SPRING. Who goes to the spring against her will, The water on her frock shall spill. Who goes to the spring because she's told, Finds the water weigh like gold. Who goes to the spring for mother's sake, The fairies half her burden take. AN UNCONSCIOUS PHILOSOPHER. There's an old farm house, with a field below, And a donkey always stands there, so. Sometimes he is eating grass, or drinking; But oftenest he is standing thinking. And I've often wanted to find out What sort of things he thinks about. Does he think of the river always flowing, Where it comes from, and where it is going? Does he think of the people along the road, What is their business, where their abode? He must have such lots to think about, I only wish I could find it out! For I'm sure, he looks so wise when I pass, That, though he's a donkey, he isn't an ass. THE VOYAGE OF THE KATE. Hurrah for The Kate!—that's the name of this ship; She's just coming home from an extra long trip: I am the Captain, and Baby's the crew, And Jessie's the people on shore come to view. She's been to the Indies for sugar and tea; She met with rough weather—those ripples you see: She nearly got wrecked on a dangerous reef;— You can see it out yonder, that great lily-leaf. A pirate—the wicked old swan—came in chase, But she showed him a clean pair of heels in the race; And now she's safe home the excitement is great, And the Captain and all shout “Hurrah for The Kate!” A HERO. Do you know our dear old Nero? He's a dog, and he's a hero! Once,—'twas in his younger days, When he was rougher in his ways,— He and I were romping here, And my sister standing near, When a push he chanced to give her, And she tumbled in the river. Yes, but hardly was she in it,— In sprang Nero—in a minute Caught her by the pinafore, And drew her safely to the shore. So he really is a hero, Isn't he, our dear old Nero! Though he condescends to tricks, Such as fetching walking-sticks. WINTER. The world is cold; The sun's grown old; The trees are bowed; Fields wear a shroud; The stream is lead; All things are dead. A wind like the blast of death has blown, And turned the living world to stone. The world is bright With sudden light; The sun's grown young; Birds find a tongue; Glitters each spray; All things are gay. It is only a warm little human maiden, Who passes with blushes like roses laden. O stream we have long time followed. Where shall our farewell be? Not where thy waves are swallowed In the unremembering sea. Rather, in a valley lonely, When a sudden bend is nigh, And the winds and the weeds hear only, We will whisper our soft good-bye!</field>
