      <field name="fulltext">[Go barstard Orphan packe thee hence] Go barstard Orphan packe thee hence, And seeke some straunger for defence: Now ginnes thy basenesse to be knowne, Nor dare I take thee for mine owne: Thy leuity shal be discried. But if that any haue espied, And question with thee of thy Sire, Or Mistrisse of his vaine desire, Or aske the place from whence thou came, Deny thy Sire, Loue, Place, and Name: And if I chance vnwares to meete thee, Neither acknowledge mee, nor greete mee, Admit I blush, perchance I shall, Passe by, regard me not at all, Be secrete, wise, and circumspect, And modesty sometimes affect: Some goodman that shall thinke thee witty, Will be thy patrone, and take pitty: And when some men shall call thee base, He for thy sake, shall him disgrace: Then with his countenance backt, thou shalt Excuse the nature of thy fault: Then if some laddes, when they goe by, Thee bastard call, giue them the ly, So get thee packing and take heede, And though thou goe in beggars weede, Heereafter when I better may, I'le send reliefe some other day. SONNETS SONNET I. [Mystrisse behold in this true-speaking Glasse.] Mystrisse behold in this true-speaking Glasse. Thy beauties Graces of all women rarest, Where thou maist finde how largely they surpasse And staine in glorious louelynesse the fayrest. But read (sweete Mistrisse) and behold it neerer Pondring my sorrowes outrage with some pitty, Then shalt thou finde no worldly creature deerer, Then thou to me, thy selfe, in each Loue ditty. But in this mirrhor equally compare, Thy match-lesse beauty, with mine endlesse griefe: There like thy selfe, none can be found so faire. Of chiefest paines, there are my paines the chiefe, Betwixt these both, this one doubt thou shalt finde, Whether are here, extreamest in their kinde. SONNET II. [Whiles with strong chaines, of hardy-tempered steele] Whiles with strong chaines, of hardy-tempered steele, I bound my thoughtes, still gadding fast and faster: When they through time, the diffrences did feele, Betwixt a mistrisse seruice and a maister. Keeping in bondage iealously enthralled, In prisons of neglect, his natures mildenesse. Him I with sollitary studies walled, By thraldome choaking his out-rageous wildenesse. On whome, my carefull thoughtes I set to watche, Guarding him closely, least he should out-issue: To seeke thee (Laya) who still wrought to catch, And traine my tender boy, that could not misse-you: So you bewitcht him once, when he did kisse-you: That by such sleightes, as neuer were found out To serue your turne he dayly went about. SONNET III. [He when continuall vigill mou'd my watche] He when continuall vigill mou'd my watche, Some-deale by chance, with carefull guarde to slumber: The prisons keyes, from them did slowly snatche, Which of the fiue, were onely three by nomber: The first was Sight, by which he searcht the wardes, The next was Hearing, quickly to perceiue: Least that the watch-men heard, which were his guardes: Third, Touch, which Vulcanes cunning could deceiue. These tho the Springes, Wardes, Boultes, or Gimbols were The Miracles of Vulcanes forgery: Laide open all for his escape: now there, The watch-men grin'd for his impiety, What crosses bred this contrariety: That by these keyes, my thoughtes in chaines be left, And by these keyes, I of myne hart bereft. SONNET IIII. [Laya soone sounding out his nature throughly] Laya soone sounding out his nature throughly, Found that he was, a Louely Virgin Boy: Causelesse why did thou then, deale with him roughly, Nor yet content with him, sometime to toy. But iealouse kept, least he should runne from thee, Whome if thou kindely meant to Loue, 'twas needelesse: Doubting least that he should runne backe to mee, If of him any deale, thou didst stand heedelesse. Thou coop'st him in thy Clossets secret Corners, And then thy heartes deere play-fellow didst make him, Whome thou in person guardedst least suborners Should worke his freelidge, or in secrete take him, And to this instant, neuer would forsake him: Since for softe seruice, slauish bondes bee change, Why didst thou from, thy iealouse maister range? SONNET V. [It chaunced after, that an youthfull squier] It chaunced after, that an youthfull squier, Such as in courting, could the crafty guise, Beheld light Laya, shee with fresh desier, Hoping th' atchieuement of some richer prise: Drew to the Courtier, who with tender kisse, (As are their guilefull fashions which dissemble.) First him saluted, then with forged blisse Of doubtlesse hope, sweete wordes by pause did tremble. So whiles shee sleightly gloas'd, with her new pray, Mine hartes eye tending his false mistrisse traine: Vnyoak't himselfe, &amp; closely scap't away, And to Parthenophe did poast amaine For liberall pardon, which she did obtaine: And iudge (Parthenophe) for thou canst tell, That his escape from Laya, pleas'd mee well. SONNET VI. [Him when I caught, what chaines had I prouided] Him when I caught, what chaines had I prouided, What fetters had I fram'd, what lockes of reason: What keyes of continence, had I deuised, Impatient of the breach, gainst any treason. But faire Parthenophe, did vrge me still, To liberall pardon, for his former fault: Which out alas, preuailed with my will, Yet mou'd I bondes, least he should make default: Which willingly shee seem'd to vndertake, And saide, as I am virgine, I will bee His bale, for this offence, &amp; if he make An other such vagare, take of mee A pawne, for more assurance vnto thee. Your Loue to me quoth I, your pawne shall make, So that for his default, I forfeit take. SONNET VII. [Her Loue to mee shee foorthwith did impawne] Her Loue to mee shee foorthwith did impawne, And was content to set at liberty: My trembling hart, which straight began to fawne, Vpon his mistrisse kindely curtesy. Not many dayes were past, when like a wanton, He secretly did practise to depart, And to Parthenophe did send a Canton Where, with sighes accentes, he did loues impart: And for because she daign'd him that great signe, Of gentle fauours, in his kinde release: Hee did conclude all duety to resigne, To faire Parthenophe which doth encrease These woes, nor shall my rest-lesse muses cease: For by her of mine heart am I depriued, And by her, my first sorrowes heate reuiued. SONNET VIII. [Then to Parthenophe (with all post hast)] Then to Parthenophe (with all post hast) As full assured of the pawne fore pledged I made, and with these wordes disordred plac'd, Smooth, tho with furies sharp out-rages edged: Quoth I (fayre mistres) did I set mine hart At libertie, and for that made him free, That you should arme him for another start, Whose certaine bale you promised to bee? Tush (quoth Parthenophe) before he goe I'le be his bale at last, and doubt it not. Why then (said I) that morgage must I shoe Of your true-loue which at your hands I got? Ay me, she was, and is his bale I wot, But, when the morgage should haue cur'd the soare: She past it of, by deede of gift before. SONNET IX. [So did Parthenophe release myne hart] So did Parthenophe release myne hart, So did she robbe me of myne harts rich threasure, Thus shall she be his bale before they part, Thus in her loue she made me such hard measure Ay me nor hope of mutuall loue by leasure, Nor any type of my poore harts release Remaines to me, how shall I take the ceasure Of her loues forfeture, which tooke such peace Combyned with a former loue, then cease To vexe with sorrowes, and thy greefes encrease. Tis for Parthenophe thou sufferst smart. Wyl'de natures wound not curable with art Then cease, with choking sighes and hart-swolln throbbes. To draw thy breath, broke of with sorrowes sobbes. SONNET X. [Yet giue me leaue (since all my ioyes be perisht)] Yet giue me leaue (since all my ioyes be perisht) Hartlesse to moane, for my poore harts departire. Nor should I mourne for him if he were cherisht, Ah no! she keepes him like a slauish martyre: Ah me! since mercylesse she made that chartyre, Sealed with waxe of stedfast continence, Sign'd with those hands which neuer can vnwrite it, Writ with that penne, which by preheminence To sure confirmes whatseuer was inditit: What skilles to weare thy gyrdle or thy gartyre, When other armes shall thy small wast imbrace? How great a wast, of mynde and bodies weale Now meltes my soule! I to thine eyes appeale, If they thy tyrant champions owe me grace. SONNET XI. [Why didst thou then in such disfigured guize] Why didst thou then in such disfigured guize Figure the pourtraict of myne ouerthro? Why manlike didst thou meane to tyrannize, No man but woman would haue sinned so: Why then inhumaine and my secret foe Didst thou betray me, yet would be a woman? From my cheef wealth out weauing me this woe, Leauing thy loue in pawne till time did come on When that thy trustlesse bondes were to be tryed, And when (through thy default) I thee did sommon Into the court of stedfast loue, then cryed As it was promist, here standes his harts bale: And if in bondes to thee my loue be tyed: Then by those bondes, take forfect of the sale. MADRIGALL 1. [Oh powers cÅlestiall, with what sophistrie] Oh powers cÅlestiall, with what sophistrie Tooke she delight, to blancke my hart by sorrow, And in such Riddels act my tragÅdie, Making this day for him, for me to morrow. Where shall I Sonnets borrow Where shall I finde brests, sides, and tong, Which my great wrongs might to the world dispence? Where my defence? My Phisicke where? for how can I liue long That haue forgone myne hart? I'le steale from hence, From restlesse soules myne Hymnes, fr? seas my teares, From windes my sighes from c?caue rockes and steele My sides and voyces Echo: reedes which feele Calme blastes still-mouing, which the shepheard beares For waylefull plaints, my tong shall be: The land vnknowne to rest and comfort me. MADRIGALL 2. [Might not this be for mans more certaintie] Might not this be for mans more certaintie By natures lawes enactit That those which do true meaning falsifie Making such bargaines as were precontractit Should forfect freelidge of loues tenancie Tot'h plaintiffe greeu'd if he exact it Thinke on my loue, thy faith: yet hast thou crakt it Nor nature reason loue nor faith can make thee To pitie me my prisoned hart to pitie Sighes no fit incense nor my plaintes can wake thee Thy nose from sauour and thine eares from sound Stopt'e and obturate, nought could shake thee Thinke on when thou such pleasure found To read my lynes and reading terme them wittie Whiles lines for loue and braynes for bewtie witlesse I for thee feuer-schor't, yet thou still fitlesse. SONNET XII. [Vext with th' assaultes of thy conceiued bewtie] Vext with th' assaultes of thy conceiued bewtie I restlesse on thy fauors meditate: And tho dispare full loue (sometime) my suite tye Vnto these fagottes figures of my state, Which bound with endlesse lyne by leasure wate That happy moment of your hartes reply. Yet by those lynes I hope to finde the gate, Which through loues laberinth shall guide me right. Whiles vnacquainted exercise I try Sweete solitude I shunne my lifes cheef light And all because I would forget thee quite And (working that) me thinke it's such a sinne (As I take penne and paper for to write) Thee to forget: that leauing I beginne. SONNET XIII. [When none of these my sorrowes would aledge] When none of these my sorrowes would aledge, I sought to finde the meanes, how I might hate thee. Then hatefull curiousnesse I did in wedge Within my thoughtes, which euer did awaite thee. I fram'd myne eyes for an vniuste controllment, And myne vnbrydled thoughtes (because I dare not Seeke to compell) did pray them take enroulment Of natures faultes in her, and equall spare not. They search't and found her eyes were sharpe, and fierie: A moule vpon her forhead, colour'd pale. Her haire disordred, browne and crisped wyerye. Her cheekes thinne speckled with a sommers male. This tolde, men ween'd it was a pleasing tale. Her to disgrace, and make my follies fade And please it did, but her more gracious made. MADRIGALL 3. [Once in an arbour was my mistresse sleeping] Once in an arbour was my mistresse sleeping With rose and woodbind wouen Whose person thousand graces had in keeping Where for myne hart her harts hard flint was clouen To keepe him safe: behind stood pertly peepinge Poore Cupid softly creepinge And draue small birdes out of the myrtle bushes Scar'd with his arrowes who sate cheeping On euery sprigge whom Cupid calles and hushes Fr? branch to br?ch whiles I poore soule sate weeping To see her breathe not knowing Incense into the cloudes and blesse with breath The wyndes and ayre whiles Cupid vnderneath With birdes with songes nor any posies throwing Could her awake Each noyse sweete lullaby was for her sake. MADRIGALL 4. [There had my Zeuxes place and time to draw] There had my Zeuxes place and time to draw My mistresse pourtraict, which on platane table With nature matching colours as he saw Her leaning on her elbow, tho not able He gan with vermil, gold, white, and sable To shadow forth: and with a skilfull knuckle Liuely set out my fortunes fable, On lippes a rose, on hand an hony-suckle. For nature fram'd that arbour in such orders That roses did with woodbynes buckle, Whose shadow trembling on her louely face He left vnshadow'd, there arte lost his grace And that white lillie leafe with fringed borders Of Angels gold vayled the skyes Of myne heauens hierarchie which clos'd her eyes. SONNET XIIII. [Then him controlling, that he left vndonne] Then him controlling, that he left vndonne Her eyes bright circle thus did answere make, Restes mist with siluer cloude had clos'd her Sunne, Nor could he draw them till she weare awake Why then quoth I were not these leaues darke shade Vpon her cheekes depainted, as you see them: Shape of a shadow can not well be made Was answer'd, for shades shadowes none can eye them. This reason, proues, sure argument for me, That my greefes image I can not set out: Which might with liuely coloures blazed be. Wherefore since nought, can bring the meanes about That thou my sorrowes cause should vewe throughout, Thou wilt not pitie me: but this was it. Zeuxes had neither skill, nor colours fit. SONNET XV. [Where or to whom then shall I make complaint] Where or to whom then shall I make complaint, By guilefull wyles, of myne hartes guide depriued? With rightes iniustice, and vnkind constraint Barr'd from her loues which my desertes atchiued. This though thou sought to choake farre more reuiued Within myne hartlesse brest, left almost sencelesse, Oh make exchange, surrender thine for myne, Least that my body voyde of guide be fencelesse, So shalt thou pawne to me signe for a signe Of thy sweete conscience, when I shall resigne Thy loues large Charter, and thy bondes againe. Oh but I feare myne hopes be voyde, or mencelesse, No course is left, which might thy loues attaine: Whether with sighes I sewe, or teares complaine. SONNET XVI. [Yea that accursed deede before insealed] Yea that accursed deede before insealed, Is argument of thy first constancie: Which if thou hadst to me before reuealed I had not pleaded in such feruencie, Yet this delightes, and makes me triumph much That myne hart in her body lyes imprisoned: For (mongst all bay-crown'd conquerors no such Can make the slauish captiue bost him conquered) Except Parthenophe, whose fiery gleames (Like Ioues swift lightning ragen, which rockes pearseth) Heating them in-lye with his soddeyne beames And secret golden mynes with melting searseth, Eft-soones with cannon, his drad rage rehearseth Yet nought seemes scortched, in apparant sight: So first she secret burnt, then did affright. SONNET XVII. [How then succeedeth (that amid this woe)] How then succeedeth (that amid this woe) Where reasons sence doth from my soule deuide: By these vaine lines my fittes be specified Which from their endlesse Ocean dayly floe Where was it borne whence did this humour groe? Which long obscur'd with melancholyes mist Inspires my gyddie braynes vnpurified So liuely, with sound reasons to persist In framing tunefull Elegies, and Hymnes For her whose name my Sonnets note so trimmes, That nought but her chast name so could assist: And my muse in first tricking out her lymmes, Found in her liuelesse shadow such delight: That yet she shadowes her, when as I write. SONNET XVIII. [Write write, helpe helpe, sweet muse and neuer cease] Write write, helpe helpe, sweet muse and neuer cease In endlesse labours pennes and papers tyer Vntill I purchase my long-wish't desier: Braynes with my reason neuer rest in peace, Wast breathlesse wordes, and breathfull sighes increase, Till of my woes remorsefull you espye her, Till she with me, be burnt in equall fier. I neuer will from labour wittes release My sences neuer shall in quiet rest Till thou be pitifull, and loue alike: And if thou neuer pitie my distresses Thy crueltie with endlesse force shall strike Vpon my witts, to ceaselesse writs addrest: My cares (in hope of some reuenge) this lesses. SONNET XIX. [Imperious Ioue with sweet lipp'd Mercurie] Imperious Ioue with sweet lipp'd Mercurie Learned Minerua, PhÅbus god of light Vain-swelling Bacchus, Venus queene of bewtie With light foote PhÅbe lampe of silent night: These haue (with diuerse dieties beside) Borrow'd the shapes of many a mortall creature, But (faire Parthenophe) grac'd with the pride Of each of these, sweet Queene of louely feature. As tho she were, with pearle of all their skill By heauens cheefe nature garnished she knittes In wrath Ioues forehead, with sweet noting quill She matcheth Mercurie, Mineruaes wittes, In goldie-lockes bright Tytan, Bacchus syttes In her hands conduict pypes, sweet Venus face, Dianaes legge the tyrian buskines grace. SONNET XX. [These eyes thy bewties tenants, pay dew teares] These eyes thy bewties tenants, pay dew teares For ocupation of myne hart thy free hold: In tenour of loues seruice (if thou behold) With what exaction it is helde through feares, And yet thy rentes extorted, dayly beares, Thou would not thus consume my quiets gold. And yet thr couetous thou be, to make Thy bewtie rich, with renting me so roughlie And at such sommes, thou neuer thought doest take, But still consumes me, then thou doest misguide all: Spending in sport for which I wrought so toughlie. When I had felt all torture and had tryed all, And spent my stocke through streane of thine extortion On that I had but good hopes for my portion. SONNET XXI. [Yea but vncertaine hopes, are anchors feeble] Yea but vncertaine hopes, are anchors feeble When such faint-harted pilates guide my shippes, Of all my fortunes ballist with hard peeble Whose doubtfull viadge proues not worth two chippes If when but one darke cloud shall dimme the skie The cables of hopes happinesse be cut, When barke with thoughtes drown'd marriners shall lye Prest for the whirle poole of greeses endlesse glutte. If well thou meane (Parthenophe) then rauishe Mine hart with doubtlesse hope of mutuall loue, If otherwise, then, let thy tong runne lauishe: For this, or that, am I resoulu'd to proue, And both, or either extasie, shall moue Me rauish't, end with surfet of releefe: Or sencelesse daunted dye, with soddeine greefe. SONNET XXII. [From thine harts euer burning vestall fier] From thine harts euer burning vestall fier, The torch-light of two sunnes is norisht still. Which in milde compasse still surmounting hyer There orbes with circled harmonie fulfill. Whose rowling wheeles runne on Meridian line, And turning, the turne backe the mistie night, Report of which cleare wonder did incline Mine eyes to gaze vpon that vncouth light, On it till I was sun-burnt did I gaze, Which with a feruent agonie possest me. Then did I sweate, and swelt, mine eyes daze Till that a burning feuer had opprest me: Which made me faint, no Phisicke hath represt me. For I trye all, yet for to make me sound Ay me! no grasse, nor Phisicke may be found. SONNET XXIII. [When with the dawning of my first delight] When with the dawning of my first delight The day light of loues delycasie mou'd me Then from my heauens disdainfull starrie light The moone-light of her chastitie reprou'd me Her forheads threatfull cloudes from hope remou'd me Till midnight rear'd on the mid-noctiall line Her hart whiles pities sleight had vndershou'd me Then did I force her downward to decline Till dawning day light chearefully did shine And by such happie reuolution drew Her mornings blush to ioyfull smiles encline And now Meridian heate dries vp my dewe There rest faire Planets stay bright orbes of heauen Still smiling at my dyall next eleuen. SONNET XXIIII. [These mine hart-eating eyes doe neuer gaze] These mine hart-eating eyes doe neuer gaze Vpon thy sonnes harmonious marble wheeles But from these eyes through force of thy sunnes blaze Raine teares continuall, whiles my faithes true steeles Tempred on anueile of thine harts could flint Strikes marrow-melting fier into mine eyes: The tinder whence my passions doe not stint As matches to those sparkles which arise. Which when the taper of mine hart is lighted Like Salamanders nurrish in the flame And all the loues with my new torch delighted A while like gnattes did florish in the same But burnt their winges, nor any way could frame To flye from thence, since Ioues proud byrd that beares His thunder veu'd my sunne but shed downe teares. SONNET XXV. [Then count it not disgrace if any vew me] Then count it not disgrace if any vew me Some-time to shower downe riuers of salt teares From tempest of my sighes dispayre-full feares: Then scorne me not alasse sweet frends but rew me: Ah pitie pitie me for if you knew me, How with her lookes mine hart amendes and weares, Now calme now rageous as my passion beares You would lament with me, and she which slew me. She (which Ay me) she which did deadly wound me And with her bewties balme tho dead keepes liuely My liuelesse body, and by charmes hath bound me For thankelesse meede to serue her if she viuely Could see my sorrowes maze which none can treade She would be soft, and light, tho flint and lead. SONNET XXVI. [When louely wrath my mistresse hart assaileth] When louely wrath my mistresse hart assaileth, Loues golden dartes take ame from her bright eyes: And Psiche Venus rosie couche empayleth Plac'd in her cheekes, with lillyes where she lyes: And when she smyles from her sweet lookes and cheare-full Like PhÅbus when through soddein cloudes he starteth, After sterne tempestes, showers, and thunder feare-full, So she my worldes delight with her smiles harteth. Aurora yellow lookes when my loue blushes, Wearing her heares bright colour in her face, And from loues rubie portall louely rushes For euery word she speakes an Angels grace: If she be silent euery man in place With silence wonders her, and if she sleepe, Ayre doth with her breathes murmur musicke keepe. SONNET XXVII. [Why do I draw this coole releeuing ayer] Why do I draw this coole releeuing ayer And breathe it out in scaulding sighes as fast? Since all my hopes dye buried in dispayer In which hard soyle mine endlesse knottes be cast: Where when I come to walke be soundry mazes With bewties skilfull finger lyned out, And knottes whose borders set with double dazes, Doubles my dazed muse with endlesse doubt How to finde easie passage through the time VVith which my mazes are so long beset, That I can neuer passe but fall and clyme According to my passions which forget The place where they with loues guide should haue met: But when faint-wearied all me thinkes is past The maze returning makes me turne as fast. SONNET XXVIII. [So be my labours endlesse in their turnes] So be my labours endlesse in their turnes Turne turne Parthenophe turne and relent, Hard is thine harte and neuer will repent, See how this hart within my body burnes: Thou sees it not atin'd therfore thou reiournes My pleasures, ill my dayes bene ouerspent: When I begge grace, thou myne intreatie spurnes: Mine hart with hope vpheld, with feare returnes Betwixt these passions endlesse is my fit Then if thou bee but humaine grant some pitie Or if a saint sweet mercies are there meedes Faire louely chast sweet-spoken learned wittie These make thee saint-like and these saints befit But thine hard hart makes all these graces weedes.

Right so, my teares, tong, passions, hart, dispaire VVith flouds, complaints, sighes, throbbes, and endlesse sorrow, In seas, in volumes, windes, earth-quakes, and hell, Shall floate chaunte, breath, breake, and darke mansion borrow. And in them I be blessed for my faire: That in these torments for her sake I dwell. SONNET XXXI.

SONNET XXXII. [Scarse twise seuen times had PhÅbus waggon wheele] Scarse twise seuen times had PhÅbus waggon wheele Obliquely wandred through the Zodiacke line, Since nature first to Ops did me resigne, VVhen in mine youthfull vaine I well could feele A lustfull rage, which reasons cheanes of steele VVith headstrong force of lust did still vntwine, To wanton fancies I did then encline: VVhilst mine vnbridled Phaeton did reele VVith heedlesse rage, till that his chariot camme To take in fould his resting with the Ramme But bootlesse all: for such was his vnrest That in no limittes he could be contained. To lawlesse sportes and pleasures euer prest And his swift wheeles, with their sweet oyle distained. SONNET XXXIII. [Next when the boundlesse furie of my sunne] Next when the boundlesse furie of my sunne Began in higher Climates to take fier, And with it somewhat kindled my desier, Then least I should haue wholy bene vndonne (For now mine age had thrise seuen winters ronne) VVith studies, and with labours did I tyer Mine itching fancies, which did still aspier: Then from those obiectes (which their force begonne Through wandring furie to possesse mine hart) Mine eyes there vaine seducers I did fixe On Pallas, and on Mars, home, and in field, And armed strongly least my better part To milder obiectes should it selfe immixe, I vow'd I neuer would to bewtie yeeld. SONNET XXXIIII. [But when in May my worldes bright fierie sunne] But when in May my worldes bright fierie sunne Had past in Zodiacke with his golden teame To place his beames which in the twynnes begunne, The blazing twynne starres of my worldes bright beame My mistresse eyes, mine heauens bright sunne, and moone, The starres by which poore shepheard I am warned To pinne in late, and put my flockes out soone, My flockes of fancies as the signes me learned: Then did my loues first spring beginne to sproute, So long as my sunnes heate in those signes rayned. But wandring all the Zodiacke throughout From her mayes twynnes, my sunne such heate constrained, That where at first I litle had complained, From signe to signe, in such course he now posteth VVhich dayly me, with hotter flaming tosteth. SONNET XXXV. [Next when my sunne by progresse tooke his hold] Next when my sunne by progresse tooke his hold In Cancer of my mistresse craftie minde, How retrograde seem'd she, when as I told That in his clawes such torches I did finde, VVhich if she did not to my teares lay plaine That they might quenched be from their outrage, My loues hot Iune should be consum'd in payne Vnlesse her pittie make my greefe asswage. Oh how she frownes, and like the Crabbe backe turnes VVhen I request her put her beames apart: Yet with her beames my soules delight she burnes: She pities not to thinke vpon my smart Nor from her Cancers clawes can I depart, For there the torch of my red-hot desier Greeues, and releeues me, with continuall fier. SONNET XXXVI. [And thus continuing with outrageous fier] And thus continuing with outrageous fier, My sunne proceeding forward to my sorrow Tooke vp his court, but willing to retier VVithin the Lyons denne his rage did borrow: But whiles within that mansion he remayned, How cruell was Parthenophe to me, And when of my great sorrowes I complained, She Lyon-like wish't the might tenfold be: Then did I rage and in vnkindly passions I rent mine heare, and rac'd my tender skinne, And rauing in such frantique fashions, That with such crueltie she did beginne To feede the fier which I was burned in. Can women brooke to deale so sore with men? She mannes woe learn'd it in the Lyons denne. SONNET XXXVII. [But pitie which sometimes doth Lyons moue] But pitie which sometimes doth Lyons moue, Remou'd my sunne from moodie Lyons caue, And into Virgoes boure did next remoue His fierie wheeles, but then she answere gaue That she was all vow'd to virginitie, Yet said boue all men she would most affect me: Fye Delian goddesse in thy companie She learn'd with honest colour to neglect me, And vnderneath chast vayles of single life She shrowdes her craftie clawes, and Lyons hart, VVhich with my sences now do mingle strife Twixt loues, and vertues, which prouoke my smart: Yet from these passions can I neuer part, But still I make my suites importunate To thee, which makes my case infortunate. SONNET XXXVIII. [When thine hart-pearcing answers could not hinder] When thine hart-pearcing answers could not hinder Mine harts hot hammer on thy steele to batter, Nor could excuses cold quench out that cynder VVhich in me kindled was, she weigh'd the matter, And turning my sunnes chariot him did place In Libras equall mansion, taking pawse, And casting with deepe iudgement to disgrace My loue, with dealing cruell in the cause: She busilie with earnest care deuised, How she might make her bewtie tyrannous, And I for euer to her yoke surprised: The meanes founde out with cunning perillous: She turn'd the wheeles with force impetuous, And arm'd with woman like contagion, My sunne she lodged in the Scorpion. SONNET XXXIX. [Then from her Venus, and bright Mercurie] Then from her Venus, and bright Mercurie Mine heauens cleare Planets, did she shoot such blazes As did infuse with heates extremitie Mine hart, which on dispaires bare pasture grazes: Then like the Scorpion did she deadly sting me, And with a pleasing poison pearced me, Which to these vtmost sobbes of death did bring me, And through my soules faint sinewes searced me: Yet might she cure me with the Scorpions oyle If that she were so kinde, as bewtifull, But in my bale she ioyes to see me boyle, Tho be my passions deare, and dewtyfull, Yet she remorselesse, and vnmercifull: But when my thought of her, is such a thing To strike me dead, iudge if her selfe can sting. SONNET XL. [But ah my plague through times outrage increased] But ah my plague through times outrage increased, For when my sunne his taske had finished Within the Scorpions mansion, he not ceased Nor yet his heates extreames diminished, Till that dead aming Archer drest his quiuer, In which he closely couched at the last, That Archer which doth pearce both hart, and liuer With hot gold-pointed shaftes, which ranckle fast: That proud commaunding, and swift-shooting Archer, Farre shooting PhÅbus which doth over shoote, And more then PhÅbus, is an inward parcher, Thou with thy notes harmonious, and songes soote Allur'd my sunne, to fier mine harts soft roote: And with thine ever wounding golden Arrow First prick't my soule, then perc'd my bodies marrow. SONNET XLI. [When my sunne Cupid tooke his next abyding] When my sunne Cupid tooke his next abyding Mongst craggie rockes and mountaines with the goate, Ah then on bewtie did my sences doate, Then had each fayre regard my fancies guiding, Then more then blessed was I if one tyding Of fÃ¦mal fauour set mine hart a floate: Then to mine eyes each mayde was made a moate. My fickle thoughtes with diuerse fancies slyding With wanton rage of luste so me did tickle: Mine hart each bewties captiuated vassall Nor vanquish't then, as now, but with loues prickle Not deepely mou'd, till loues beames did discouer That louely Nymphe Parthenophe, no louer, Stoppe there for feare, loues priuiledge doth passe all. SONNET XLII. [Passe all, ah no! no iot will be omitted] Passe all, ah no! no iot will be omitted Now though my sunne within the water rest Yet doth his scaulding furie still infest: Into this signe whiles that my PhÅbus flitted Thou mou'd these streames, whose courses thou committed To me thy water-man bound and adrest To powre out endlesse droppes vpon that soyle Which withers most when it is watred best: Cease floodes, and to your channells make recoyle, Strange floodes which on my fier burue like oyle: Thus whiles mine endlesse furies hyer ran, Thou thou (Parthenophe my rage begunne, Sending thy beames to heate my fierie sunne: Thus am I water-man, and fier-man. SONNET XLIII. [Now in my Zodiackes last extreamest signe] Now in my Zodiackes last extreamest signe, My lucklesse sunne his happelesse mansion made, And in the water willing more to wade To Pisces did his chariot wheeles incline: For me poore fish he with his golden lyne Bayted with bewties, all the riuer lade: (For who of such sweet baytes would stand afrade) There nibbling for such foode as made me pyne, Loues golden hooke on me tooke soddeine holde Aud I downe swallow'd, that empoysened golde Since then, deuise what any wisher can Of fiercest tormentes, since all ioyes deuise, Worse greefes, more ioyes did my true hart comprize, Such were loues hates, my craftie fisher man. MADRIGALL 5. [Such str?ge effects wrought by thought wo?ding Cupid] Such str?ge effects wrought by thought wo?ding Cupid In changing me to fish, his bates to swallow With poyson choaking me, vnlesse that you bid Him to my stomacke giue some Antidote: Fly litle god with winges of swallow, Or if thy feathers fast floate, That Antidote from mine harts empresse bring, My feeble sences to reuiue: Least, if thou waue it with an Eagles winge To late thou come, and finde me not aliue. MADRIGALL 6. [Oh why lou'd I? for loue to purchase hatred] Oh why lou'd I? for loue to purchase hatred, Or wherefore hates she? but that I should loue her, Why were these cheekes with teares bewatred? Because my teares might quenche those sparkes, Which with heates pitie moue her: Her cloudie frowne with mist her bewtie darkes, To make it seeme obscured at my smyles, In darke true Dyamonds will shine. Her hate my loue, her heate my teares beguyles: Feare makes her doubtfull, yet her hart is mine. MADRIGALL 7. [Youthes wanton spring, when in the raging Bull] Youthes wanton spring, when in the raging Bull My sunne was lodg'd, gaue store of flowers: With leaues of pleasure, stalkes of howers Which soone shak'd of the leaues, when they were full Of pleasures bewtie dew'd, with Aprill showers: My sommer loue, whose buddes were bewtifull, Youthfull desiers with heates vnmercifull Parched, whose seedes when haruest time was come Weare eares against my suites obturate, With sheaues of scorne bo?d vp, which did bÃ¨numme Mine heate with greef, yet made her hart indurate: Oh chast desiers which hel'd her hart immurate In wall's of Adamante vnfoyled! My winter spent in showers of sorrowes teares Haylestones of hatred, frostes of feares, My braunches bar'de of pleasure, and despoiled. MADRIGALL 8. [Why am I thus in mynde, and body wounded?] Why am I thus in mynde, and body wounded? Oh mynde, and body mortall, and deuine! On what sure rocke is your forte grounded? On death? Ah no for at it you repine: Nay both intombed in her bewties shrine Will liue (tho shadowlike) that men astounded At their Anatomies, when they shall vewe it, May pitifull rewe it, Yea but her murthering bewtie doth so shine, Oh yet much mercilesse! That hart desiers to liue with her which slew it, And tho she still rest pitylesse: Yet at her bewtie will I wonder, Though sweet graces past repeate, Neuer appeare (but when the threate) Fiering my secret hart, with darte and thunder. SONNET XLIIII. [Oh dart and thunder whose fierce violence] Oh dart and thunder whose fierce violence Surmounting Rhetorickes dart and thunderboultes Can neuer be set out in eloquence, Whose might all mettles masse a sonder moultes: Where be they famous Prophetes of ould Greece? Those anchiant Romaine Poetes of acompt, MusÃ¦us which went for the Golden Fleece With Iason, and did Heroes loues recompt And thou sweet Naso with thy golden vearse Whose louely spirite rauish't CÃ¦sars daughter, And that sweet Tuskane Petrarke which did pearse His Laura with loue Sonnets when he saught her: Where be these all? that all these might hau? taught her That sainctes deuine are knowne sainctes by their mercy, And sainctlike bewtie should not rage with pearse eye.

Returne deare hart and me to mine restore, Ah let me thee possesse, returne to mee: I finde no meanes deuayde of skill and artlesse Thether returne where thou triumph't before Let me of him but repossessor bee And when thou giues to me mine hart againe Thy selfe thou doest bestow, for thou art shee, Whom I call hart, and of whom I complaine. SONNET XLVIII. [I wish no rich-refinde Arabian gold] I wish no rich-refinde Arabian gold Nor Orient Indian pearle rare natures wonder, No Diamondes th' Aegiptian surges vnder, No Rubyes of America deare sold, Nor Saphyres which rich Affricke sandes enfold Treasures far distant, from this Isle a sunder, Barbarian Iuories in contempt I hold: But onely this, this onely Venus graunt That I my sweet Pathenophe may get: Her heires no grace of golden wyers want Pure pearles with perfect Rubines are inset, True Dyamondes in eyes, Saphires in vaynes, Nor can I that soft Iuory skinne forget: England in one small subiect such containes. SONNET XLIX. [Coole coole in waues, thy beames intollerable] Coole coole in waues, thy beames intollerable O sunne, no sonne but most vnkinde stepfather, By law nor nature fier but rebell rather, Foole foole these labours are inextricable, A burthen whose weight is importable, A Syren which within thy brest doth bath her A fiend which doth in graces garments grath her, A fortresse whose force is impregnable: From my loues lymbeck still still'd teares, oh teares! Quench quench mine heate, or with your soueraintie Like Nyobe conuert mine hart to marble: Or with fast-flowing pyne my body drye And ryd me from dispaires chyll'd feares, oh feares!

[So warble out your tragique notes of sorrow] So warble out your tragique notes of sorrow Blacke harpe of liuer-pyning melancholie Blacke humor patrone of my fancies folie, Meere folies which from fancies fier borrow, Hot fier which burnes day, night, midnight, and morrow, Long morning which prolonges my sorrowes solie And euer ouerules my passions wholie: So that my fortune where it first made forrow Shall there remaine, and euer shall it plowe The bowels of mine hart, mine harts hot bowells: And in their forrowes sow the seedes of loue, Which thou didst sow, and newly spring vp now And make me write vayne wordes, no wordes but vowells, For nought to me good consonant would proue. SONNET LI. [Lame consonants of member-vowells robbed] Lame consonants of member-vowells robbed What perfect-sounding wordes can you compose Wherein you might my sorrowes flame disclose? Can you frame mamed wordes as you had throbbed? Can you with sighes make signes of passions sobbed? Or can your characters make sorrowes showes? Can liquids make them? I with teares make those, But for my teares with taunts and frumpes am bebbed: Could mutes procure good wordes mute would I bee, But then who should my sorrowes image paint? No consonants or mutes or liquids will Set out my sorrowes, tho with greefe I faint: If with no letter but one vowell should bee, An A. with H. my Sonnet would fulfill. SONNET LII. [Me thought Calliope did from heauen discende] Me thought Calliope did from heauen discende To sing, fayre mistresse thy sweet bewties praise, Thy sweet enchanting voyce did Orpheus raise, Who with his harpe which downe the gods did sende CÅlestiall concorde to the voyce did lende, His musicke all wild beastes so did amaze That they submissiue to thy lookes did bende: Hilles, trees, townes, bridges, from their places wende Hopping, and dancing, all they windes be still And listen, whiles the Nightingalles fulfill With Larkes and Thrushes all defectes of pleasure: Springs sang thy prayses in a murmur shill, Whiles I inrag'd with musicke, out of traunce Like Bacchus preeste, did in thy presence daunce. MADRIGALL 9. [For glorie pleasure and fayre florishing] For glorie pleasure and fayre florishing, Sweet singing, courtly dauncing, curious loue A rich remembrance vertues nurrishing, For sacred care of heauenly things For voyces sweetnesse musickes notes aboue When she deuinely speakes or sings Cleio dismount, Euterpe silent bee, Thalia for thy purple put on sack-cloath, Sing hoarse Melpomine with Ioues Harpies three, Terpsichore breake of thy galliard daunces, Leaue Erato thy daliance, court in black-cloath, Thy prayses Polymneia she inhaunces, For heauenly zeale Vrania she outreacheth, Pleade not Calliope sing not to thy Lute, Ioue and Mnemosine both be mute Whilst my Parthenophe your daughters teacheth. MADRIGALL 10. [Thou scal'd my fort blind Captaine of conceite] Thou scal'd my fort blind Captaine of conceite, But you sweet mistresse entred at the breach: There you made hauocke of my hart, There you to triumph did my tyrant teach, Beware he knowes to winne you by deceit, Those Iuory walles cannot endure his dart, That turret fram'd with heauens rare art Immur'd with whitest porphyre, and inset With roses checking natures pride of Rubye: Those two true Diam?ds which their windows frette, Arch't with pure gold yet mourne in sable shade, Warne not these that in daunger you bee? Vanquish her little tyrant I will true bee, And tho she will not yeeld to mee Yet none could thrall my hart but shee. MADRIGALL 11. [Thine eyes mine heauen which harbour louely rest] Thine eyes mine heauen which harbour louely rest, And with their beames all creatures cheare Stoule from mine eyes there cleare, And made mine eyes dimme myrrouldes of vnrest. And from her lillye forhead smooth, and plaine, My front his withered forrowes tooke, And through her grace, his grace forsooke: From soft cheekes rosie redde, My cheekes their leanesse, and this pallid staine. The golden penne of natures booke (For her tong that taske vndertooke) Which to the graces secretorie ledde, And sweetest muses with sweet musicke fedde, Inforc'd my muse in tragique tunes to sing: But from her harts hard frozen string, Mine hart his tendernesse, and heare possest. MADRIGALL 12. [Like to the mountaines are mine high desiers] Like to the mountaines are mine high desiers Leuell to thy loues highest point, Grounded on faith which thy sweet grace requiers, For springs, teares rise in endlesse sourse: For sommers flowers, loues fancies I appoint They trees with stormes tost out of course Figure my thoughtes still blasted with dispaire: Thunder, lightning, and hayle, Make his trees mourne, thy frownes make me bewayle, This onely diffrence here fier there snowes are. SONNET LIII. [Why do I draw my breath vaine sighes to feede] Why do I draw my breath vaine sighes to feede Since all my sighes be breathed out in vayne? Why be these eyes the condnictes whence proceede These ceaselesse teares, which for your sake do rayne? Why do I write my woes, and writing greeue To thinke vpon them, and their sweet contriuer, Begging some comfort which mighe me releeue, When the remembrance is my cares reuiuer? Why do I sew to kisse, and kisse to loue, And loue to be tormented, not beloued? Can neither sighes, nor teares my sorrowes moue, By lynes, or wordes, nor will they be remoued? Then tyre not tyrant, but on mine hart tyer, That vnconsum'd I burne in my desier. SONNET LIIII. [When I was yong indewd'd with natures graces] When I was yong indewd'd with natures graces I stoule blind loues strong bow and golden arrowes, To shoote at redbrestes, goldfinches, and sparrowes: At shrew'd gyrles, and at boyes in other places I shot when I was vexed with disgraces: I perc't no skinne, but melted vp their marrowes, How many boyes and gyrles, wish't mine embraces? How many prayz'd my fauour, boue all faces? But once (Parthenophe) by thy sweet side sitting Loue had espyed me in a place most fitting Betray'd by thine eyes beames, which makes blind see: He shot at me, and said for thine eyes light, This daring boy that durst vsurpe my right, Take him a wounded slaue, to loue, and thee. SONNET LV. [Nymphes which in bewtie mortall creatures staine] Nymphes which in bewtie mortall creatures staine, And Satyres which none but faire Nymphes beholde, They to the Nymphes, and Nymphes to them complaine, And each in spight, my mistresse bewtie tolde: Till soundely sleeping in a myrtle groue, A wanton Satyre had espyed her there, Who deeming she was dead, in all hast stroue To fetch the Nymphes which in the forestes were: They flocking fast, in triumph of her death Lightly beheld, and (deeming she was dead) Nymphes sang, and Satyres daunced out of breath, VVhilest Satyres with the Nymphes la voultaes lead My mistresse did awake, then they which came To scorne her bewtie, ran away for shame. SONNET LVI. [The dyall loue which shewes how my dayes spende] The dyall loue which shewes how my dayes spende, The leaden plummets sliding to the ground, My thoughtes which to darke melancholye bend, The rowling wheeles, which turne swift howers round Thine eyes (Parthenophe) my fancies guide: The watch continually which keepes his stroake, By whose oft turning euery hower doth slide Figure the sighes which from my lyuer smoake, VVhose oft inuasions finish my liues date: The watchman which each quarter strikes the bell, Thy loue which doth each part exanimate, And in each quarter strikes his forces fell: That hammer, and great bell which endes each hower, Death my lifes victor, sent by thy loues power. SONNET LVII. [Thy bewtie is the sunne which guides my day] Thy bewtie is the sunne which guides my day, And with his beames to my worldes life geues light, VVith whose sweet fauour all my fancies play, And as byrdes singing still inchant my sight But when I seeke to get my loues cheefe pleasure, Her frownes are like the night ledde by the lampe Of Phoebes chast desiers, whilest without leasure Graces like starres through all her face encampe: Then all my fancies byrdes lye whisht for feare, Soone as her frownes procure there shadie sorrow Sauing mine hart, which secret shot doth beare And nature from the Nighting all doth borrow: VVhich from lamentes, because he will not rest Hath loues thorne prickle pointed at his brest. SONNET LVIII. [Fayre Clytie doth florish with the spring] Fayre Clytie doth florish with the spring And eftsoones withered like thy golden heare, And Ioes vyolettes grow florishing, But soone defac'd which thine eyes semblance beare: Anemone, with hyacinthe springs pryde, Like to thy bewtie loose their louely glosse, So will thy cheekes with graces bewtified Returne to wrinckles, and to natures drosse: Roses (as from thy lippes) sweet odours send, Which herbes in them whilst iuyce, and vertues rest, From some diseases rigour, life defend: These (as thy selfe) once withred, men detest: Then loue betimes, these withered flowers of yore Reuiue: thy bewtie lost returnes no more. SONNET LIX. [Ah me sweet bewtie lost returnes no more] Ah me sweet bewtie lost returnes no more, And how I feare thine hart fraught with disdaine, Dispaier of her disdayne castes doubt before. And makes me thus of mine harts hope complaine, Ah me nor mine harts hope, nor helpe: dispaier Auoyde my fancie, fancies vtter bayne My woes cheefe worker, cause of all my cayer Auoyde my thoughtes that hope may me restore To mine hartes heauen, and happinesse againe: Ah wilt thou not but still depresse my thought? Ah (mistresse) if thy bewtie this hath wrought, That proude disdainefulnesse shall in the rayne, Yet thinke when in thy forhead wrinckles bee, Men will disdaine thee then, as thou doest mee. SONNET LX. [Whilst some the Troiane warres in verse recount] Whilst some the Troiane warres in verse recount, And all the Grecian Conquerours in fight, Some valiant Romaine warres boue starres do mount, With all their warlike leaders, men of might: Whilst some of Bryttish Arthures valure sing, And register the prayse of Charlemayne: And some of doughtie Godfrey tydinges bring, And some the Germaine broyles, and warres of Spayne: In none of those, my selfe I wounded finde Neither with horseman, nor with man on foote: But from a cleare bright eye, one captaine blinde (VVhose puisance to resist did nothing boote) With men in golden armes, and dartes of golde, VVounded my hart, and all which did beholde. SONNET LXI. [To none but to Prometheus me compayer] To none but to Prometheus me compayer, From sacred heauen he stoule that holy fier: I from thine eyes stoule fier, my iudgements are For to be bound with cheanes of strong desier To that hard rocke of thy thrise cruell hart: The ceaselesse waues, which on the rockes do dash Yet neuer pearce, but forced backward start Those be these endlesse teares, my cheekes which wash: The vulture which is by my goddesse doome Assign'd to feede vpon mine endlesse lyuer, Dispaire by the procur'd, which leaues no roome For Ioculus to iest with Cupides quyuer: This swallowes worldes of liuers, spending few, But not content: O god shall this be true? SONNET LXII. [Fye, fye, fierce tyrant, quenche this furious rage] Fye, fye, fierce tyrant, quenche this furious rage, O quenche this rageous furie, little god! Nay mightie god, my furies heate asswage, Nor are thine little dartes, nor brittle rodde, Ah that you hadst a sweet recuring dart, Or such a rodde as into health might whippe mee: With this to leuell at my troubled hart, To warne with scourge that no bright eye might trippe mee, Vayne wordes which vanish with the cloudes why speake I? And bootelesse options builded with voyde ayer? How oft enrag'd in hopelesse passions breake I, How oft in false vaine hope, and blacke dispayer? How oft left liuelesse at thy cloudie frowne? How oft in passion, mounted, and pluck't downe? MADRIGALL 13. [Soft louely Roselike lippes, conioyn'd with mine] Soft louely Roselike lippes, conioyn'd with mine, Breathing out pretious incense such, Such as at Paphos smoake to Venus shrine, Making my lippes immortall with their tuche: My cheekes with tuch of thy soft cheekes deuine, Thy soft warme cheekes, which Venus fauour much: Those armes, such armes which me embrac'de, Me with immortall cyncture guirding rounde Of euerlasting blisse, then bounde With her enfolded thighes in mine entangled, And both in one selfe soule plac'de, Made an Hermophrodite, with pleasures rauish't: There heate for heats, soule for soules empyer wr?gled, Why dyed not I with loue so largely lauish't? For wake (not finding truth of dreames before) It secret vexeth, tentimes more. MADRIGALL 14. [Ah tentimes woorse tormented then before] Ah tentimes woorse tormented then before, Tentimes more pittie should'st thou take of mee, I haue endur'd, then sweet restore That pleasure, which procur'd this paine: Thou scorn'st my lynes, a sainct which make of thee, Where true desiers of thine hard hart complaine: There thou boue stella plac'de, Boue laura with ten thousand more install'd, And now proude thinkes me grac'd, That am to thee (though mercilesse) inthrall'de. SONNET LXIII. [Ioue for Europaes loue tooke shape of Bull] Ioue for Europaes loue tooke shape of Bull, And for Calisto playde Dianaes parte And in a golden shower, he filled full The lappe of Danae with cÅlestiall arte, Would I were chang'd but to my mistresse gloues, That those white louely fingers I might hide, That I might kisse those hands, which mine hart loues Or else that cheane of pearle, her neckes vaine pride, Made proude with her neckes vaines, that I might folde About that louely necke, and her pappes tickle, Or her to compasse like a belt of golde, Or that sweet wine, which downe her throate doth trickle, To kisse her lippes, and lye next at her hart, Runne through her vaynes, and passe by pleasures part. SONNET LXIIII. [If all the loues were lost, and should be founde] If all the loues were lost, and should be founde, And all the graces glories were decayde, In thee the graces ornamentes abounde, In me the loues by thy sweet graces layde. And if the muses had their voyce forgone, And Venus husbandes forge had lost his fier, The muses voyce, should by thy voyce be knowne, And vulcanes heate, be sounde in my desier. I will accuse thee to the goddes of thefte, For Pallas eye, and Venus rosie cheeke, And Phoebes forehead, which thou hast berefte, Complaine of me to Cupid, let him seeke In vayne for me each where, and in all partes, For gainst my will, I stoule one of his dartes. SONNET LXV. [Oh that I had no hart, as I haue none] Oh that I had no hart, as I haue none, (For thou mine hartes full spirite hast possessed) Then should myne argument be not of mone, Then vnder loues yoke should should I not be pressed: Oh that without myne eyes I had been borne, Then had I not my mistresse bewtie vewed, Then had I neuer been so farre forlorne, Then had I neuer wep't, then neuer rewed: Oh that I neuer had been borne at all, Or beeing, had been borne of shepheardes broode, Then should I not in such mischances fall, Quyet my water and content my foode: But now disquieted, and still tormented, With aduerse fate, perforce must rest contented. SONNET LXVI. [Ah sweet content, where is thy mylde abode?] Ah sweet content, where is thy mylde abode? Is it with shepheardes and light-harted swaynes? Which sing vpon the downes and pype abroade Tending their flockes and cattell on the playnes? Ah sweet content, where doest thou safely rest? In heauen, with Angels which the prayses sing Of him that made and rules at his behest The mindes, and harts of euery liuing thing? Ah sweet content, where doth thine harbour hold, Is it in Churches, with Religious men, Which please the goddes with prayers manifold, And in their studies meditate it then. Whether thou doest in heauen, or earth appeare, Be where thou wilt, thou will not harbour here. SONNET LXVII. [If Cupid keepe his quiuer in thine eye] If Cupid keepe his quiuer in thine eye, And shoote at ouer-daring, gasers hartes, Alas why be not men afrayde, and fllye As from Medusaes, doubting after smartes? Ah when he drawes his string, none sees his bow, Nor heares his golden fethred arrowes sing, Ay me till it be shot no man doth know, Vntill his hart be pricked with the sting, Like semblance beares the musket in the field, It hittes, and killes vnseene, till vnawares To death wounded man his body yeeld, And thus a pesant, CÃ¦sars glorie dares: This diffrence left, twixt Mars his field, and loues, That Cupids souldior shot, more torture proues. SONNET LXVIII. [Would God (when I beheld thy bewteous face] Would God (when I beheld thy bewteous face, And golden tresses, rich with pearle, and stone) Medusaes visage had appear'd in place, With snakie lockes, looking on me alone: Then had her dreadfull charming lookes me changed Into a sencelesse stone, oh were I sencelesse! Then rage through rash regard had neuer ranged, Whereas to loue I stood disarm'd and fencelesse: Yea but that diuerse obiect of thy face, In me contrarious operations wrought, A mouing spirite, prick't with bewties grace, No pitties grace in thee, which I haue sought Which makes me deeme, thou didst Medusa see, And should thy selfe, a mouing marble bee. SONNET LXIX. [The leauelesse branches of the liuelesse bowes] The leauelesse branches of the liuelesse bowes Carue winters out-rage in their withered barkes: The withered wrinckles, in my carefull browes Figure from whence, they drew those crooked markes: Downe from the Thracean mountaines, okes of might, And loftie firres into the valley fall, Sure signe where Boreas hath vsurp'te his right, And that long there, no Syluanes dally shall: Fieldes with prodigious inundatious drown'de, For Neptunes rage, with Amphitrite weepe: My lookes, and passions, likewise shewe my wounde, And how some fayre regard did strike it deepe. These braunches, blasted trees, and fieldes so watred, For wrinckles, sighes, and teares, fore shew thine hatred. SONNET LXX. [What can these wrinckles, and vayne teares portende] What can these wrinckles, and vayne teares portende But thine hard fauour, and indurate hart? What shew these sighes, which from my soule I send But endlesse smoake, raiz'd from a fierie smart? Canst thou not pittie my deepe wounded brest? Canst thou not frame those eyes to cast a smile? Wylt thou with no sweet sentence make me blest? To make amendes wilt thou not sport a while? Shall we not once with our opposed eyne In interchange, send, golden dartes rebated? With short reflection twixt thy browes and mine Whilest loue with thee, of my greefes hath debated? Those eyes of loue, were made for loue to see, And cast reguardes on others, not on mee. SONNET LXXI. [Those haires of Angels gold, thy natures treasure] Those haires of Angels gold, thy natures treasure (For thou by nature Angellike art framed) Those louely browes, broade bridges of sweet pleasure, Arche two cleare springs of graces gratious named, There graces infinite do bathe, and sporte: Vnder on both sides, those two pretious hilles Where Phoeb'e, and Venus haue a seuerall forte: Her couche with snowie lillyes Phoebe filles, But Venus with redde Roses her's adorneth, There they with silent tokens doe dispute: VVhilst Phoebe Venus, Venus Phoebe scorneth, And all the graces Iudgers there sit mute To giue their verdict, till great Ioue said this, Dianaes arrowes wounde not like thy kisse. SONNET LXXII. [My mistresse bewtie matched with the graces] My mistresse bewtie matched with the graces Twix't Phoeb', and Iuno should be Iudged there, Where she with maske had, vayl'd the louely places, And graces in like sort I masked were: But when their louely bewties were disclos'd This Nymphe (quoth Iuno) all the graces passeth, For bewteous fauours in her face dispos'd, Loues goddesse, in loues graces she surpasseth: She doth not passe the graces Phoebe sade (Though in her cheekes the graces richly sitte) For they be subiectes to her bewtie made, The glorie for this fayre Nymphe is most fitte: There in her cheekes the graces blush for shame, That in her cheekes to striue, the subiectes came. SONNET LXXIII. [Why did rich nature graces graunt to thee] Why did rich nature graces graunt to thee, Since thou art such a niggard of thy grace? Or how can graces in thy body bee Where neither they, nor pittie finde a place? Ah they bene handmaydes to thy bewties furie, Making thy face to tyrannise on men. Condemn'd before thy bewtie by loues Iurie, And by thy frownes adiudg'd to sorrowes den Graunt me some grace, for thou with grace art wealthie And kindely mayst afforde some gratious thing, Mine hopes all as my minde weake and vnhealthie, All her lookes gratious, yet no grace do bring To me poore wretche, yet be the graces theare: But I the furies in my brest doe beare. SONNET LXXIIII. [Cease ouer-tyred muses to complayne] Cease ouer-tyred muses to complayne, In vayne thou powers out wordes, in vayne thy teares, In vayne thou writes thy verses, all in vayne: For to the rockes and wall which neuer heares Thou speakes, and sendes complaintes which finde no grace: But why compaire I thee to rockes, and walles: Yes thou discendes from stones and rockes by race, But rockes will answere to the latter calles, Yea rockes will speake each sentences last word, And in each sillabe of that word agree, But thou nor last nor first wilt me afford: Hath pride or nature bred this fault in thee, Nature, and pride haue wrought in thee these euils, For women are by nature proude as diuels. SONNET LXXV. [Loue is a name too louely for the god] Loue is a name too louely for the god, He naked goes, redde colour'd in his skinne. And bare (all as a boy) fitte for a rod: Hence into Africke, there seeke out thy kinne, Amongst the Moores, and swarthie men of Inde, Me thou of ioyes, and sweet content hast hindred: Hast thou consum'd me, and art of my kinde? Hast thou inrag'd me, yet art of my kindered? Nay Ismarus, or Rhodope thy father, Or craggie Caucasus thy crabbed sier, Vesuuius else, or was it Aetna rather? For thou how many doest consume with fier? Fierce Tygres, VVolues, and Panthers gaue the sucke For louely Venus had not such euill lucke. SONNET LXXVI. [Be blind mine eyes, which saw that stormie frowne] Be blind mine eyes, which saw that stormie frowne: Wither long-watring lippes, which may not kisse: Pyne armes, which wish't for sweet embraces missee And vpright parts of pleasure, fall you downe: VVast wanton tender thighes consume for this, To her thighes elmes, that you were not made vynes: And my long pleasure in her body grafted, But at my pleasure her sweet thoughtes repines. Mine hart with her faire colours should be wafted Throughout this Oceane of my deepe dispaier: VVhy doe I longer liue, but me prepaier My life togather with my ioyes to finish? And (long eare this) had I dyed with my care But hope of ioyes to come, did all diminish. SONNET LXXVII. [How can I liue in mindes or bodies health] How can I liue in mindes or bodies health VVhen all foure elementes my greefes conspier? Of all harts ioyes depriuing me be stelth, All yeelding poysons to my long desier, The fire with heates extreames mine hart enraging, Water in teares, from dispaires fountaine flowing, My soule in sighes, ayer to loues soule ingaging, My fancies coales, earthes melancholie blowing. Thus these (by nature) made for my releefe, Through that bold charge, of thine Imperious eye Turne all their graces into bitter greefe, And I were dead should any of them dye: And they my bodies substance all be sicke, It followes then, I can not long be quicke. SONNET LXXVIII. [The proudest Planet in his highest Spheare] The proudest Planet in his highest Spheare, Saturne inthronist in thy frowning browes: Next aufull Ioue thy maiestie doth beare: And vnto dreadfull Mars, thy courage bowes, Drawne from thy noble grandfathers of might: Among'st the laurell crowned Poetes sweete, And sweet Musitions take the place by right: For Phoebus with thy graces thought it meete: Venus doth sit vpon thy lippes, and chinne: And Hermes hath inrich't thy wittes deuine: Phoebe with chast desiers thine hart did winne: The Planettes thus to thee their powers resigne. Whom Planets honour thus is any such? My muse then can not honour her too much. SONNET LXXIX. [Couetous eyes, what did you late behold?] Couetous eyes, what did you late behold? My riuall graced with a sunne-bright smile, Where he with secret signes, was sweetly told Her thoughtes with winkes, which all men might beguile Audacious did I see him kisse that hand, Which holdes the reanes of mine vnbridled hart, And softely wringing it did closely stand Courting with loue termes, and in louers art: Next (with his fingers kist) he toucht her middle, Then saucie (with presumption vncontrolld) To hers from his eyes sent regardes hy riddle. At length, he kist her cheeke: ah me! so bold To bandie with bel-gardes in interchange? Blind mine eyes (enuie) that the may not range. SONNET LXXX. [Long wish't for death, sent by my mistresse doome] Long wish't for death, sent by my mistresse doome Hold take thy prisoner full resolu'd to dye, But first as cheefe, and in the highest roome My soule to heauen I doe bequeath on hye, Now readie to be seuer'd from thy loue: My sighes to ayer, to Christall springes my teares, My sad complaintes (which thee could neuer moue) To mountaines desolate, and deafe, my feares To Lambes beset with Lyons, my dispare To night, and irksome dungeons full of dread: Then shalt thou finde (when I am past this care) My tormentes which thy cruelties haue bredde In heau?s, clouds, springs hard mountaines, lambes, &amp; night. Here once vnited, then disseuer'd quite. SONNET LXXXI. [O kingly ielousie which canst admitte] O kingly ielousie which canst admitte No thought of com-peeres in thine high desier! Loues bastard daughter for true-loues vnfitte Scaulding mens harts, with force of secret fier: Thou poysoned cancour of much-bewteous loue, Fostred of enuies pappes with wrathfull rage, Thou which doest still thine owne distruction moue With eagles eyes, which secret watch doth wage: With Peacockes feete, to steale in vnawares: With prognes winges to false suspect which flyes Which vertues hold in durance rashly dares, Prouoker, and maintayner of vaine lyes, Who (with rich vertues, and faire loue possest) Causelesse hast all to thine harts hell adrest. SONNET LXXXII. [The chariot with the steed is drawne along] The chariot with the steed is drawne along, Shippes wing'd with windes, swift houer on the waues: The stubborne plowes are hayl'd with Oxen strong, Hard Adamant the strongest yron craues: But I am with thy bewtie strongly forc'd, Which (full of courage) drawes me like the steede: Those windes thy spirite, whence cannot be diuorc'd, Mine hart the shippe, from danger neuer free'd: That strong conceipt on thy sweet bewtie lade, The strong neck't Oxe, which drawes my fancies plow: Thine hart that Adamant, whose force hath made My strong desiers, stand subiect vnto you. Would I were horse, oxe, Adamante, or winde: Than had I neuer car'd, for woman-kinde. SONNET LXXXIII. [Darke night blacke image of my fowle dispare] Darke night blacke image of my fowle dispare, With greeuous fancies cease to vexe my soule, With payne, sore smart, hot fires, cold feares, long care: Too much (alas) this ceaselesse stone to roule. My dayes be spent in penning thy sweet prayses, In pleading to thy bewtie neuer matched, In looking on thy face, whose sight amazes My sence, and thus my long dayes be dispatched. But night fourth from the mistie region rising Fancies with feare, and sad dispayer doth send, Mine hart with horrour, and vayne thoughtes agrizing: And thus the fearefull tedious nightes I spend: Wishing the noone to me were silent night, And shades nocturnall, turned to daylight. SONNET LXXXIIII. [My sweet Parthenophe, within thy face] My sweet Parthenophe, within thy face My passions Calender may plaine be red: The golden number told vpon thine hed, The sunne dayes (which in carde I holy place And which diuinely blesse me with their grace) Thy chearefull smiles which can recall the dedde: My working dayes, thy frownes from fauours fledde, Which set a worke the furies in my brest These dayes are six to one more then the rest: My leape yeare is (oh when is that leape yeare) When all my cares I ouerleape, and feast With her fruition whom I hould most deare. And if some Calenders the truth tell mee, Once in fewe yeares, that happie leape shall bee. SONNET LXXXV. [From Eastes bed roasie, whence Aurora riseth] From Eastes bed roasie, whence Aurora riseth Be thy cheekes figur'd, which their beames display In smiles: whose sight myne hart with ioy surpriseth, And which my fancies flowers do fayre aray, Chear'd with the gracious dewes of her regarde: The West, whence euening comes, her frowning brow, Where discontentment plowes his furroes harde, (There doth she burie her affections now) The North whence stormes, with mistes and frostes proceede, My blacke dispayer, long sorrowes, and cold feare: The South whence showers, in great abundance breede, And where hot sunne doth to Meridian reare, Mine eyes whose obiectes naught but teares requier, And my soft hart consum'd with rage of fier. SONNET LXXXVI. [Oh fierie rage, when wilt thou be consum'd] Oh fierie rage, when wilt thou be consum'd, Thou that hast me consumed in such sort, As neuer was poore wretch (which so presumed) But for surueying of that bewteous sort? Kep't in continuall durance, &amp; inchayn'd With hot desires, which haue my body pyned: My minde from pleasures, and content restrained, My thoughtes to care, and sorrowes ward assigned: There, with continuall melancholie placed In dismall horror, and continuall feare I passe these irksome howers, scorn'd and disgraced Of her, whose crueltie no brest can beare, No thought endure, no torture can outmatch: Then burne on rage of fier, but me dispatch. SONNET LXXXVII.

Her eyes were neuer made mans enemies: Then me with me conceipt she ouerthwartes, Vrging my fancie, which vayne thoughtes impartes To be the causer of mine iniuries, Saying I am not vext as I complained, How melancholye bred this light conceipt: Hard-harted mistresse, canst thou thinke I fayned?

Those first desiers which in my brest did boyle, From which thy loues (vnkinde) thou banished Had not been such an exile to my blisse.

All instrumentes, all birdes, and voyces Make no such heauenly musicke in their kinde: No fruites haue such sweet sappe, No roote such ioyces, No balme so much reioyces: O breath, exceeding euery rich perfume! For loue all pleasures in a kisse did lappe. Her eyes did giue bright glaunces, Sight is no fight, all light with that consume: She tuch't my cheeke, at which tuch mine hart da?ces, Mine eyes, in priuie combate did prÃ¦sume Charging mine handes to charge her middle, Whilst they threw wounding darts, &amp; healing launces: She kist and spoke attonce a riddle: But such sweet meaning in darke sence As shew'd the drift of her deare-sweet pretence, More pleasing, then the corde of Harpe, or Lute. On heauenly cherries then I feede, Whose sappe deliciouser then Angels food, Whose breath more sweet, th? g?me, herbe, flower, or bood, O kisse which did all sence exceede!

Kisse still, and make no misses, Double, redouble kisses, Murmure affections, warre in pleasing strife: Presse lippes, lippes rest oppressed, This passion is no fiction. MADRIGALL 18.

My muse hath these for theames, They to my muse, my muse to them defence, Phoebus (sometimes) loues oracles sendes thence. Thus by my sunne a rose, (Though a sweet rose pricklesse) Pricklesse arose, deare prickle! Which me diseaseth much, though I be sicklesse, Nought me of ioy bereaues, Saue fauour, sappe, and sauour all be fickle.

Thy bewties fancie, to mine hart is thrall, Mine hart, thy beauties thrall is founde: And thou mine hart a bulwarcke art, Conquer'd with bewtie, batter'd to the grounde. And yet though conquer'd will not yeeld at all, For in that conflict though I fall, Yet I my selfe a conquerer repute: In fight continuall, like victorious mart, Yet euer yeeld, as euer ouerthrowne. To be still prisoner is my suite, I will be still thy captiue knowne: Such pleasing seruitude, Victorious conquest is, and fortitude. MADRIGALL 20.

Sweet graces (which continually attend her) At her short breath, breathe short, and sigh so deepe, Which sicknesses sharpe furies might appease: Both loues, and graces striue to mende her.

Ah me poore man, where shall I finde some rest! Not in thine eyes with promise fearefull hope, Thine hart hath vow'd I shall be still distrest, To rest within thine hart there is no scope. All other places, made for bodies ease As bed, field, forrest, and a quiet chamber, There euer am I with sad cares opprest, Each pleasaunt spectacle doth me displease, Greefe, and dispaire so sore on me did sease That day with tediousnesse doth me molest And (Phoebe carryed in her coach of Amber) Can not close vp the fountaines of my woe: Thus dayes from nightes my charg'd hart doth not know, Nor nightes from dayes, all howers to sorrowes goe: Then punish fancie, cause of thy disease. ELEGIE VII. Youth full of errour, whether doest thou hayle me? Downe to the dungeon of myne owne conceite: Let me before take some deuine receite, For will I know my gaoler will not bayle me: Then if thou fauour not, all helpes will fayle me, That fearefull dungeon poysoned with dispaire Affordes no casement to receaue sweet ayer, There ougly visions euer will apayle me Vayne youth misguideth soone with loues deceite Deeming false painted lookes most firmely fayre. Now to remorselesse iudges must I sewe For gracious pardon, whiles they do repeate Your bold presumption, threatning me with you: Yet am I innocent, though none bewayle me. Ah pardon, pardon, childish youth did vew Those two forbidden apples which they wish't for, And children long for that with once the rew. Suffice he found repentance which he fish't for With great expence of bates, and golden hookes. Those liuing apples do the suite pursue And are you Iudges, see their angry lookes VVhere vnderneath that wrath-full Canopie The vse to open their condemning bookes: Expect now nothing but extremitie, Since they be Iudges, and in their owne cause. Their sightes are fixte on nought but crueltie, Ruling with rigour (as they list) their lawes Oh graunt some pittie, plac'd in pitties hall! Since our forefather for the like offence With vs receiu'd sufficient recompence, For two fayre apples, which procur'd his fall: ELEGIE VIII. Cease sorrow, cease, oh cease thy rage alittle, Ah litle ease, oh graunt some little ease: Oh fortune euer constante, neuer brittle! For as thou gan so doest thou still displease. Ah ceaselesse sorrow, take some truice with mee, Remorselesse tyrantes, sometime will take peace (Vpon conditions) and I'le take of thee Conditions, so thou wilt thy furie cease. And deare conditions, for to forfect life So thou wilt ende thy plagues, and vexe no more. But out alas! he will not cease his strife Least he should loose his priuiledge before: For were I dead, my sorrowes rule were nought, And whiles I liue, he like a tyrant rageth: Ah rage fierce tyrant, for this greefe is wrought By loue thy counsell which my minde ingageth. To thy fierce thralldome, whiles he spoyles myne hart, So be my minde, and hart imprisoned fast, To two fierce tyrantes, which this empyer part. Oh mylder goddes shall this for euer last, If that I haue these bitter plagues deseru'de, Yet let repentance which my soule doth melt Obtaine some fauour, if you be not sueru'de From lawes of mercy, know what plagues I felt. Yea but I doubt inchantment in my brest, For neuer man, so much agreeu'd as I Could liue with ceaselesse sorrowes weight opprest, But twentie thousand times perforce should dye: And with her eyes she did bewitche mine hart, Which lettes it liue, but feele an endlesse smart. ELEGIE IX. With humble suite vpon my bended knee, (Though absent farre from hence not to be seene) Yet in thy power still present as goddes bee I speake these wordes, whose bleeding woundes be greene, To thee drad Cupid, and thy mother Queene: If it at any time hath lawfull beene Men mortall to speake with adietie, Oh you great guiders of yong springing age, VVhose power immortall euer was I weene (As mightie as your spatious Monarchie) Oh spare me, spare my tedious pilgrimage! Take hence the least brand of your extreame fiers, Do not gainst those (which yeelde) fierce battell wage: I know by this, you will alaye your rage, That you giue life vnto my long desiers, VVhich still persuades me, you will pittie take: Life is farre more, then my vext soule desiers: Oh take my life, and after death torment mee, Then (though in absence of my cheefe delight) I shall lament alone, my soule requires, And longes to visite sweet Elizian fieldes: Then that I lou'd it neuer shall repent me, There (till those dayes of Iubile shall comme) VVould I walke pensiue, pleas'd, alone and dumme: Graunt this petition sweet loues Queene which weeldes The hart of forlorne louers euermore: Or else ZanclÃ¦an Charibd me deuoure, And through his waters sent to Stigian power, Or patient let me burne in Aetnaes flame: Or fling my selfe in furie from the shore Into deepe waues of the Leucadean god, Rather then beare this tumulte and vproare, And through your meanes be scourg'd with mine owne rod: Oh let me dye, and not endure the same: The suite I make, is to be punish't still, Nor would I wish not to be wretched there, But that I might remaine in hope, and feare: Sweet louely saintes, let my suite like your will. ELEGIE X. In quiet silence of the shadie night, All places free from noyse of men, and dogges, When Phoebe caried in her chariot bright Had clear'd the mistie vapours, and night fogges: Then (when no care the quiet shepheard clogges, Hauing his flocke safe fodder'd in the fould) A liuely vision to my fancies sight Appear'd, which me thought wake I did behould, A fierie boye, outmatching the moone light, VVho softly wispering in mine eare, had tould There thou thy fayre Parthenophe may see: I quickly turning, in an hebene bedde, VVith sable couering and blacke curtanes spredde, VVith many little loues in blacke by thee, Thee thee Parthenophe left almost dedde (Paile cold, with feare) I did behold ay mee! Ah me! left almost sencelesse in my bed: My groanes perceiu'd by those which neare me lay, By them with much ado recouered: VVhich fearefull vision so did me afray That (in a furie set beside my witte) Sicke as before, me thought I saw thee yitt: Venus thy face there couered with a vayle, Mine hart with horror chilles, to thinke on it: The graces kist thy lippes and went away. Then I with furious raging did assaile To kisse thee, least thou should depart before, And then (in sight of those which there did stand) Thinking that I should neuer see thee more, Mistaking thee, I kist a fire-brande: Burnt with the fire (my sences which did fayle Freshly recall'd into their wittes againe) I found it was a dreame, but sweet expound it, For that strange dreame, with teares renewes my paine, And I shall neuer rest, till I haue found it. ELEGIE XI. VVas it decreed by fates too certaine doome, That vnder Cancer's Tropique (where the Sunne Still doth his race in hottest circuite runne) My minde should dwell, and in none other roome, Where comfortes all be burnt, before the bloome? Was it concluded (by remorse-lesse fate) That vnder-neath Th' Erimanthian beare, Beneath the Lycaenian Axel-tree, (Where ceaselesse snowes and frostes extremitie Hold Iurisdiction) should remaine my feare, VVhere all mine hopes be nip'te, before the beare? VVas it thus ordred that (till my deathes date) VVhen Phoebus runnes on our Meridian lyne, VVhen mistes fall downe beneath our Hemi-sphoere, And Cynthia with darke Antipod's doth shine, That my dispaier should hold his mansion there? Where did the fatall sisters this assigne? Euen when this Iudgement to them was awarded, The silent sentence issew'd from her eyne, Which neither pittie, nor my cares regarded. ELEGIE XII. Oh neuer can I see that sunnie light, That bright contriuer of my fierie rage, Those precious golden apples shinning bright, But out alas, me thinckes some fearefull sight Should battell with the deare beholders wage. I feare such pretious thinges should haue some force Them to preserue, lest some beholders might Procure those precious apples by their slight: Then cruell Atlas banisht from remorse Enters my thoughtes, and how be fear'de away. The poore inhabitantes which dwelt about (Least some af his rich fruite should make a pray) Although the Orchard, circummur'de throughout With walles of steele was, and a vigil stoute Of watchfull Dragons guarded euery where, Which bold attemptors vext with hot pursuite, So that none durst approch his fruite for feare. Thus (Atlas-like) thine hart hath Dragons set Tyrannous hatred, and a proud disdaine, Which in that Orchard cruellie did raine, And with much rigour rule thy louely eyes, Immur'd in steelie walles of chaste desier, Which entrance to poore passengers denyes, And deathes high daunger to them that requier: And euen as Atlas (through fierce crueltie And breache to lawes of hospitalitie When lodging to a straunger he denied) Was turned to a stonie mountaine straight, Which on his shoulders now support's heauens waight, A iust reuenge for crueltie and pride: Euen so, thine hart (for inhumanitie, And wrath to those that thine eyes apples loue, And that it will not lodge a louely guest) Is turn'd to rocke, and doth the burthen beare Of thousand zealous louers deare complaintes: Whom thou with thy fierce crueltie diost teare, An huge hard rocke, which none can euer moue And of whose fruite, no man can be possest: Thy golden smiles make none attemp'ts to deare, But when attempted once those apples bee, The vayne attemptour, after feeles the smart: Who by thy Dragons, hatred, and disdaine Are torne in sonder, with extremitie: For hauing entred, no man can get forth (So those inchaunting apples hinder thee) Of such deare prize, be things of such rare worth. But euen as Perseus, Ioues thrise valiant sonne (Begot of Danae in a golden shower) Huge Atlas conquer'd, when he first begonne: Then kill'd the Dragons with his matchlesse power, At length the bewteous golden apples wonne: So right is he borne in a golden hower, (And for his fortune may from Ioue discend) Who first thine hart an Atlas hath subdue'd, Next, hatred, and disdaine brought to their end Fierce Dragons, which attemptours all purseu'de, And which before, none euer haue eschew'de: At length, who shall these golden apples gaine, He shall alone, be Perseus for his paine. ELEGIE XIII. Swift Atalanta (when she lost the prise By gathering golden apples in her race) Shewes how by th' apples of thine heauenly eyes, (Which fortune did before my passage place When for mine hartes contentement I did runne) How I was hindred, and my wager lost: When others did the wagers worth surprise I vew'de thine eyes, thus eyes vew'de to my cost, Nor could I them enioy when all was donne, But seeming (as they did) bright as the Sunne, My course I stayd, to vewe their fierie grace, Whose sweet possession I could not comprise: Th' IdÃ¦an shepheard (when the strife begunne Amongst three goddesses) as Iudge decreede, The golden apple Venus did awarde, Cause of the wast, and downefall of proud Troye; But when the graces had a sweet regard How fayre Parthenophe did her exceede, And Venus now was from the world debarr'd One so much fayrer farre, as to much coye, Parthenophe the chose in Venus fleede, And since her bewtie Venus did out goe Two golden apples were to her assigned: Which apples all th' outrageous tumultes breede That are hep'd vp in my distressed minde. Whose figure in enflamed Troye I finde, The cheefe occasion of mine endlesse woe. ELEGIE XIIII. [When I remember that accursed night] When I remember that accursed night, When my deare bewtie said she must depart, And the next morning leaue the Cities sight: Ah then, euen then blacke sorrow shew'de his might, And plac'd his empyer in my vanquish't hart: Mine hart still vanquish't, yet assaulted still, Burnt with loues out-rage, from whose cleare torch light Fierce sorrow findes, a way to spoile, and kill. Ah sorrow, sorrow, neuer satisfied! And if not satisfied, worke on thy will: Oh deare departure of mine onely blisse! When willing, from the Citie thou did ryde, And I made offer (tho then wounded wyde) To go with thee, thou rashly didst refuse With me distrest to be accompanied: And binding wordes (imperious) did'st vse Commaunding me an other way to chuse. Ah then, euen then in spirite crucified, Mine eyes with teares, mine hart with sighes, and throbbes: Those almost blind, that hard swolne almost burst, My braynes abiuring harbour to my muse, Did leaue me choaked almost with straite sobbes, Ah be that hower, and day for euer curst Which me of my lifes libertie did robbe: For since that time I neuer saw my loue, Long can we not be seuer'd, I will follow Through woods, through mountaines, waues, and caues made hollow Oh greefe, of greefes extremitie the worst! Still will I follow, till I finde thee out: And if my wish with trauell will not proue, Yet shall my sorrowes trauell round about In wailefull Elegies, and mournefull verse Vntill they finde, and thee with pittie perce: Meane while to see thee more standing in doubt. I'le sing my plaine-song with the Turtle doue; And prick-song with the Nighting all rehearse. ELEGIE XV. [Oh deare remembraunce of my Ladyes eyes] Oh deare remembraunce of my Ladyes eyes In minde whose reuolutions I reuolue! To you mine harts bright guid-starres, my soule cryes Vpon some happy sentence to resolue: A sentence either of my life, or death, So bale me from the dungeon of dispaire, On you I cry with interrupted breathe, On you, and none but you to crosse my care: My care to crosse, least I be crucified Aboue the patience of an humaine soule, Do this, Ah this, and still be glorified: Do this, and let eternities enroule Thy fame, and name, let them enroule for euer In lasting recordes of still lasting steele: Do this, ah this and famous still perseuer, Which in another age thy ghost shall feele. Yet (howsoeuer thou with me shall deale) Thy bewtie shall perseuer in my verse: And thine eyes wounde, which thine hart would not heale: And my complaintes, which could not thine hart perce: And thine hard hart, thy bewties shamefull staine: And that fowle staine, thine endlesse infamie: So (though thou still in recorde do remaine) The recordes reckon but thine obloquie, When on the paper (which my passionbeares) Relenting readers (for my sake) shed teares. ELEGIE XVI. [Ah were my teares (as many writers bee)] Ah were my teares (as many writers bee) Meere droppes of incke proceeding from my penne, Then in these sable weedes you should not see Me seuer'd from societie of men: Ah me all colours do mine eyes displease, Saue those two colours, of pure white, and redde, And yet I dare not florish it in these, Because I can not, for my colour's dead. Those colours florish round about each where, But cheefely with my mistresse in their kinde, And fayne I would her louely colours weare So that it might be pleasing to her minde: But nought will please her ouer-cruell eye, But blacke, and payle on body, and in face: Then she triumphes in bewties tyrannie, When she sees bewtie, bewtie can disgrace. When her sweet smiling eyes, drye Vestues thronne, Can blubber'd bleare-eyes drowne in seaes of teares: And laughes to here poore louers how they moane, Ioyes in the paper which her prayses beares, And (for his sake that sent) that schÅdule teares: What but pale enuie doth her hart assaile) When she would be still fayre, add laugh alone, And (for her sake) all other's mourne, and paile. ELEGIE XVII. [Deare mistresse then my soule to me much dearer] Deare mistresse then my soule to me much dearer, Wonder not that another writes my letter: For sorrow still mine hart oppresseth nearer, And extreame sicknesse doth my sinewes fetter. Of my deare life to thy loue am I debter. Thine is my soule, then soule what can be meerer: Thine my cheefe best, then that what can better? Absented farre, and (that which is farre worse) Vnable either for to goe, or ryde, Here am I in perpetuall bondage tyed, Then if with saluage Sauromates, farre worse: This ayer is loath-some, and this ayer I curse, Because with thy sweet breathe it is not blest. Though hot, coole waters I can not abide (Since the which thy cleare eyes as all the rest) Be not (as they sometimes were) purified. The ground (I tread) my footing doth infest: Because it is not hallowed with thy feete. I loath all meate, for all meate is vnmeete Which is not eaten, where thy sweet selfe feedest. Nothing is pleasaunt, louely, rich, or sweete, Which doth not with his grace thy bewtie greete: Ah too deare absence which this sicknesse breedest, Of thy deare sweet, which can not be too deare. Yet if thou wilt voutch-safe my life to saue Write but one lyne, oue lyne my life will cheare: The ransome of my life thy name will pay, And I be freede from my much doubtfull feare. ELEGIE XVIII. [If neither loue, nor pittie can procure] If neither loue, nor pittie can procure Thy ruthlesse hart subscribe to my content: But if thou vow that I shall still endure This doubtfull feare which euer doth torment. If to thine eyes thine hart can lend a fier, Whiles could disdaine vpon them settes a locke: To barre forth pittie which kinde harts desier, Whiles the distrest make prayers to a rocke. If that thine eyes send out a sunnie smile, From vnderneath a cloudie frowne of hate: Plaine loue with counterfeasance to beguile, Which at thy windowes for some grace awate. If thou thine eares can open to thy prayse, And them with that report delighted, cherish: And shut them, when the passionate assayes, To pleade for pittie, then about to perish. If thou canst cherish graces in thy cheeke, For men to wonder at, which thee behold: And they finde furies, when thine hart they seeke, And yet proue such, as are extreamely cold. Now as I finde, no thought to mans conceipt, Then must I sweare, to womans no deceit. ELEGIE XIX. [Deare sorrow giue me leaue to breathe a while] Deare sorrow giue me leaue to breathe a while, A little leaue to take a longer breath: Whose easie passage still thou doest beguile Choak'd vp with sighes, proclamers of my death. Oh let the teares of euer-thirstie eyes. Returne backe to the channells of mine hart! They to my sight be vowed enemies, And made a trayterous league not to depart, Vnder the colour of tormenting those Which were first causers of mine harts distresse, And closely with mine hart by guile did close Through blinding them to make my torment lesse. Oh let those fearefull thoughtes which still oppresse me Turne to the dungeon of my troubled brayne! Dispaire t'accompanie, which doth possesse me, And with his venome poisoneth euery vayne: Ouglie dispaire, who with blacke force assaultes Me vanquisht with conceipt, and makes me dwell With horrour, match't in melancholies vaultes: Where I lye burning in my fancies hell. Oh thou drad ruler of my sorrowes rage, Of thee, and none but thee I begge remorse VVith thy sweet breath thou may my sighes asswage, And make my sorrowes fountaines stay their course, And banish blacke dispaire, then helpe me now: Or know, death can do this, as well as thou. ELEGIE XX. [Oh deare vexation of my troubled soule] Oh deare vexation of my troubled soule My life with greefe when wilt thou consummate? The deare remembrance of my passing soule, Mine hart with some restes hope doth animate: How many haue those conquering eyes subdued? How many vanquish't captiues to thine hart! Hard-iron harted Captaines when they vew'de VVere drawne, till they were wounded with thy dart. Oh when I there heard bodies haue beheld, Their martiall stomaches, and oft wounded face: Which bitter tumultes, and garboyles foretell'd, In which, it seem'd they founde no cowardes place Then I recall'd how farre loues power exceedes Aboue the bloudie menace of rough warre: Where euery wounded hart, close inward bleedes And soddeine perc'd, with twinckling of a starre. Then (when such iron harted Captaines bee To thine harts bulwarke forced for to trye Which way to winne that sort by batterye: And how all conquerours their conquer'd lye) Me thinkes, thine hart, or else thine eyes be made (Because they can such iron obiectes force) Of hardest Adamante, that men (which lade Continuall siege) be thrall'd without remorse: Thine hart of Adamant, because it takes The hardest harts drawne prisoners vnto thine, Thine eye because, it wonded many makes, Yet no transpercing beames can pearce those eyne: Thine hart of Adamant, which none can wound: Thine eye of Adamant, vnperced found. ELEGIE XXI. [Happie depart with speede, then me more fortunate euer] Happie depart with speede, then me more fortunate euer Poore letter go thy wayes, vnto my sweet Ladyes hands: She shall looke on thee, and then with her bewtifull eyes blesse: Smiling eyes (perhaps thee to delight with a glaunce) She shall cast on a lyne (if a lyne there pleaseth her humour) But if a lyne displease, then shall apeare in a frowne, How much she dislikes thy loues, and saucie salutings: O my lifes sweet light, know that a frowne of thine eye Can transpearce to my soule more swift then a Parthian arrow, And more deepely wound then any launce, or a speare: But thy sweet smiles can procure such contrary mot'ions, Which can alone that heale, wounded afore by thine eyes: Like to the launces rust which heal'de whome warlike Achilles (With right hand valiant) doughtilye wounded afore. Not vnlike to the men, whose greefe the Scorpion helpeth (Whom he before did sting) ready to dye thorow paine: Thou that bewtie procures to be thy chastities hand mayde, With vertues regiment glorious ordred alone: Thou that those smooth browes, like plates of Iuory plained (When any looke on them) canst make apeare like a cloude: Thou that those cleare eyes (whose light surpasseth a stars light, Canst make loues flames shoote, with cruel anger abroad: Thou that those fayre cheekes (when a man thy bewtie beholdeth) Deepely to wound canst make, sweetely to blush like a rose. Make thy browes (to delight mine hart) smooth shadow thy cleare eyes: Whose smile is to my soule like to the sunne fr? a cloude When he shines to the world in most pride after a tempest, And with his heate prouokes all the delightes of the ground. Graunt me sweet Lady this, this graunt, kinde pittie requesteth Teares and sighes make asuite, pittie me, pittie my suite: Thus to thy sweet graces will I leaue my drcerye bewaylings, And to thy gracious hart; I recomend my lamentes: Thrise blessed go thy way, to my deare go thrise speedie letter, And for me kisse them, since I may not kisse her hands. CANZON 1. [All bewties farre perfections rest in thee] All bewties farre perfections rest in thee, And sweetest, grace of graces Deckes thy face bone faces: All vertue takes her glorie from thy minde: The muses in thy wittes haue their places, And in thy thoughtes all mercies bee: Thine hart from all hardnesse free: An holy place in thy thoughtes holinesse doth finde: In fauorable speech kinde: A sacred tongue, and eloquent: Action sweet, and excellent: Musique it selfe in ioyntes of her fayre fingers is: She chauntresse of singers is: Her plighted faith, is firme, and permanent. O now, now, helpe, wilt thou take some compassion? She thinkes I flatter, writing on this fashion. Thy bewtie past, with misorder stayned is. In thee no graces finde rest: In thee (who sought it) saw lest. And all thy thoughtes be vayne, and vicious: Thy braynes with heauie dullnesse are opprest. Of thee no mercy gayned is, Thine hart hard, and fayned is. A minde prophane, and of the worst suspicious: In speech not delicious: A toung ty'de which cannot vtter, Gesture lame, like wordes which stutter: Thy hands, and minde vnap'te in musique to reioyce: For songes vnfitte, an hoarse voyce: Thy faith vnconstant, whatsoeare thou mutter. Be gracious, no, she thinckes my wordes be bitter, Through my misfortunes, they for my selfe be fitter. O'h how long, how long shall I be distrest? How long in vayne, shall I moane? How long in payne, shall I groane? How long shall I bathe in continuall teares? How long shall I sit sad, and sigh alone? How long shall feare discomfort giue? How long shall hopes let me liue? How long shall I lye bounde in dispaires, and feares? VVith sorrow still my hart weares, my sundry fancies subdue me, Thine eyes kill me, when they vew me: VVhen thou speakes with my soule thy voyce musique maketh, And soules from silence waketh. Thy browes smiles quicken me, whose frownes slew me, Then fayre sweet behold, see me poore wretch in torment, Thou perceiuest well, but thine hart will not relent. Mine eyes and sleepe, be fierce professed foes: Much care and teares did make it, Nor yet will they forsake it. But they will vexe my braynes, and troubled eyes: If any sorrow sleepe, they will wake it. Still sighing mine hart ouer throwes, Yet art thou cause of these woes. But what auayles if I make to the deafe such horrible outcryes? She heares not my miseries, O sorrow sorrow cease a while! Let her but looke on me, and smile, And from me for a time thou shalt be banished, My comfortes are vanished: Nor hope, nor time, my sorrowes can beguile. Yet cease I not to cry for mercy, vexed thus: But thou wilt not releeue vs, which perplexed vs. Ah would thou set some limites to my woes, That after such a time set, (As penance to some crime set) Forbearance through sweet hope I might endure: But as byrd (caught in the fowler's lyme set) No meanes for his libertie knowes, Me such dispaire ouergoes, That I can finde no comfortable hope of cure: Then since nothing can procure My sweet comfort, by thy kindnesse, Arm'd in peace, to beare this blindnesse) I voluntarily submit to this sorrow; (As earst) each euen, and morrow: Can womens harts harbour such vnkindnesse? Oh relent, relent, and change thy behauiour: Fowle is the name of tyraunt, sweet of sauiour. Long to the rockes haue I made my complaintes, And to the woodes desolate My plaintes went, early, and late; To the forsaken mountaines, and riuers: Yet comfortlesse, and still disconsolate. Mine hart as it was wonted faintes: Such small helpe, comes from such saintes. VVhy should men which in such paine liue, be call'de liuers? Such arrowes beare loues quiuers, Now (since rockes, and woodes will not heare, Nor hilles, and floodes my sorrowes beare, In sounding Ecchoes, and swift waues, the world about) These papers report it out, VVhose lasting Chronicles, shall time out-weare. Then take remorse (deare loue) and to these vnited Shall be thy mercies, with match-lesse prayse recited. You happelesse windes, with my sighes infected, Whose fumes you neuer let rise To please her with sacrifice: But euermore ingrosse cloudes them choaked, So that my deare, could neuer them comprise, O you (that neuer detected My plaintes, but them neglected, VVhich in your murmures brought might haue her prouoked, VVhen them with cloudes you cloaked) Know, that a prouder spirite flyes, Bearing them to posterities, And layes them open wide, that the world may vew them, That all which read, may rewe them, When they shall pearce thine eares, though not thine eyes. Then sweet fayre, pittie my long seruice, and deutie, Least thine hard hart be more famous, then thy bewtie. Then do no longer despise But with kinde pittie relent thee, Cease to vexe, and torment mee: If shames feare moue not, which all discouers, Feare plague of remorse-lesse louers. THE FIRST EIDILLION of moschus describing Loue. Venus, aloude for her sonne Cupid cryed: If any spye loue gadding in the streete It is my roage, he that shall betray (For hyer) of Venus shall haue kisses sweete: But thou that bringes him, shall haue more beside, Thou shalt not onely kisse, but as guest stay. By many markes, the boy thou mayst bewray, Mongst twentie such (beside) thou shalt perceiue him Not of a pale complexion, but like fier, Quicke rowling eyes, and flaming in their gyre, False hart, sweet wordes, which quickly will deceiue him To whom he speakes, sweet speech at your desier, But vexe him, then as any waspe he stingeth: Lying, and false (if you receaue him) A craftie lad, and cruell pastimes bringeth. A fayre curl'de head, and a right waggish face. His handes are small, yet he shootes farre away, For euen so farre as Acheron he shooteth, And to th' infernall monarche, his dartes stray: Cloathlesse he naked goes in euery place, And yet to know his thoughtes, it no man booteth, Swift (as a byrde) he flyes, and quickly footeth Now to these men, and women now to those, But yet he sittes, within their very marrow, A little bow, and in that bow an arrow: A small flight-shaft, but still to heauen-ward goes, About his necke a golden dart-barrow, In which he placeth euery bitter dart, Which often euen at me he throwes, All full of crueltie all full of smart. And yet this thing more wondrous, a small brand That euen the very sunne it selfe doth burne, If him thou take, pittilesse lead him bound, And (if thou chaunce to see him weepe) returne: Then (least he thee deceaue) his teares withstand, And if he laugh, draw him along the ground, If he would kisse, refuse: his lippes confound, For those alone be poysoned euermore: But if he say, take, these I giue to thee, All those my weapons which belong to me, Tuch them not, when he layes them thee before, Those giftes of his, all false and fierie be.

Since what she list her hart fulfilles, I sigh, I weepe, I kneele, I pray, When I should kisse she runnes away: Sighes, knees, teares, prayers spent in vayne. My verses do not please her vayne. Mine hart weares with continuall thrilles, His Epilogue about to play, My sence vnsounde, my wittes in wayne, I still expect an happie day, Whilest haruest growes, my winter spilles, Parthenophe mine haruest spilles. She robbes my store-house of his grayne: Alas sweet wenche thy rage allay, Behold what fountaine still distilles, Whiles thine heates rage in me doth rayne: Yet moysture will not his flame stay. Parthenophe thy furie stay, Take hence th' occasion of these Illes, Thou art the cause, but come againe, Returne, and Floraes pride distaine, Her lillyes, rose, and daffadilles: Thy cheekes, and forhead disaray The rose and lillyes of their grayne. What swannes can yeelde so many quilles, As all glories can display. ODE 1. [When I walke forth into the woodes] When I walke forth into the woodes (With heauie passion to complaine) I vewe the trees with blushing buddes Asham'd, or greeued at my paine: There Amaranthe, with rosie staine (Me pittying) doth his leaues ingraine. When I passe pensiue to the shore, The water byrdes about me flye: As if the mournde, when riuers roare, Chyding thy wrathfull crueltie: Halcion watcheth warily To chyde thee, when thou commest-by. If to the Citie I repaier, Mine eyes thy crueltie betray: And (those which vew me) finde my cayer: Swolne eyes, and sorrowes it betray, Whose figures in my forhead are: These curse the cause of mine il-fare. When I go forth to feede my flockes, As I, so they hang downe their head: If I complaine to ruthlesse rockes (For that it seemes hard rockes her bred) Rockes ruth in riuers may be redde, Which from those rockes downe-trickled. When shepheard's would know how I fare, And aske how doth Parthenophil: Il Eccho answer's in voyde ayer: And with these newes each place doth fill. Poore herdgroomes from each cottage will Sing my complaintes, on euery hill. ODE 2. [Speake Eccho tell] Speake Eccho tell; With Lillyes, Columbines, and Roses, What their Parthenophe, composes?

And do these therfore like her vaines? Ecch her vaines There Cupid's dwell. Speake Eccho tell: Wherefore her Chaplets yellow were like, When others here, were more her like? Eccho, hearelike: Yet I know well, Her hart is Tygre-like, or Beare-like: To rockes it sell. CANZON 2.

Her I did promise euery yeare, The firstling fÅmale of my flocke That in my loue she would me furder: I curst the dayes of my first loue, My comfortes spoiles, my pleasures murther: She, she alas did me reproue, My suites (as to a stonie rocke) Were made, for she would not giue eare. Ah loue, deare loue, loue bought to deare! Mary, my sainte chast, and milde Pittie, ah pittie my suite; Thou art a virgine, pittie mee: Shine eyes, though pittie wanting. That she by them my greefe may see And looke on mine hart panting: But her deafe eares, and tonge mute Shewes her hard hart vnreconcil'de, Hard hart, from all remorse exil'de. ODE 4. [Bacchus father of all sport] Bacchus father of all sport, Worker of loues comfort: Venus best beloued brother (Like beloued is none other) Greater father of felicitie, Fill full with thy diuinitie, These thirstie, and these emptie vaines, Thence fuming vp into my braines Exceede Apollo through thy might, And make me by thy motion light: That with alacritie I may Write pleasing Odes, and still display Parthenophe, with such high praises Whose bewtie shepheard's all amases: And by those meanes her loues obtaine, Then hauing fill'd vp euery vaine, I shall be set in perfect state The rightes of loue to celebrate Then each yeare fat from my sheepe coate Thy sacrifice a tydie goate: And IÃ´ EuohÃª shall bee Loude chaunted euery where to thee.

If my power were, Such giftes as these (If they would please) Here will ingely I would present. And these those presents present bee: First Iuno sent to thee these lillyes, In whose steede chast affection moues Venus hath sent two Turtle doues, Narcissus giues the Daffadillyes: For doues true loues: For Daffadilles My golden willes: Which counteruailes, what here is sent thee. Flora doth greete thee with sweet Roses, Thetis with rich pearle Oriente; Leucothoe with franckincense: For Roses, my loues chast pretence: For pearles, those teares which I haue spent: My sighes incense, For sweet perfume: Thus I presume Poore shepheard, to presente these poasies. Though I be rude (as shepheards are) Lillyes I know, do stand for whitnesse: And Daffadilles thy golden heare: And doues thy meekenesse figures beare: Red Roses for a blushing brightnesse, Thy teeth pearles were, That incense shoed Thy breathe that bloed A sacrifice, for which goddes care. Blest is that shepheard nine times nine Which shall in bosome these flowers keepe, Bound in one posie whose sweet smell In paradise may make him dwell And sleepe a tentimes happie sleepe: I dare not mell, Else with good will Parthenophil Would to thy lippes one kisse assigne. ODE 6. [Oh fayre sweet gloue] Oh fayre sweet gloue Deuine token Of her sweet loue Sweetely broken: By wordes, sweet loues she durst not moue, These giftes her loue to me do proue Though neuer spoken. On her fayre hand This gloue once was, None in this land Did euer passe Her handes fayre white, come loues here stand, Let graces (with yours) match her hand: Hyde, hyde alas! Graces would smile If you should matche, Herr's yours beguile, Her's garlandes catche From all the Nymphes, which blush the while To see there white out-match't a myle Which prayse did watche. This gloue I kisse, And for thy sake I will not misse But ballades make, And euery shepheard shall know this, Parthenophil in such grace is Muses awake: For I will sing Thy matchelesse prayses: And my pypes bring Which floodes amaises, Wilde Satyres friskines shall out-fling, The rockes shall this dayes glorie ring Whiles Nymphes bring dazes. Some woodbynes beare Some damaske roses The muses were A bynding poases, My goddesse gloue to herrye heere, Great Pan, commes in with flowers feare. And crownes composes.

[When I did thinke to write of warre] When I did thinke to write of warre, And martiall cheefden's of the field: Diana did inforce to yeeld My muse to prayse the Westerne starre: But Pallas did my purpose barre: My muse as too weake it to weeld. Elizaes prayses were too hye, Diuinest wittes haue done their best, And yet the most haue proued least: Such was her sacred maiestie, Loues pride grace to virginitie: Oh could my muse in her prayse rest! Venus directed me to write The prayse of peerlesse bewties wonder, A theame more fit for voyce of thunder: Parthenophe, from whose eyes bright, Ten thousand graces dar'e my might, And will'd me fiue degrees write vnder. But yet her fancie wrought so much, That my muse did her prayse aduenter, Wherein of yore it durst not enter: And now her bewtie giues that tuche, Vnto my muse, in number suche: Which makes me more, and more repent her. ODE 8. [In a shadie groue of mirtle] In a shadie groue of mirtle, (Where byrdes musicall resorted) With Floraes painted flowers fertle, Which men with sight and sent comforted, Whilst turtles equally disported, Where each Nymphe loases, Bunches of poases, Which into Chapplettes sweet they sorted. There seated in that louely shade, Which Laya bewtifull there sate A gentle shepheard, which had made Gainst euening twilight somewhat late, An arbour built in Syluane state Where in exchaunge, Their eyes did raunge Giuing each other the check-mate. He said sweet comfort of my life Come and embrace Parthenophil Mette we sade she to fall at strife I will be gone I that I will I lou'd your long, why do so still I can not chuse If you refuse But shall my selfe with sorrow kill. With that he sight and would haue kist And vew'de her with a fearefull smile She turn'd and said your ame mist With sighes redoubled the meanewhile The shepheard sate, but did compile Greene knotted rushings, Then roundlayes sings: And pleasaunt doth twilight beguile. At length he somewhat nearer prest And with a glaunce the Nymphe deceauing He kist her, she said be at rest Willing displeas'd in the receauing: Thence from his purpose neuer leauing He prest her further, She would cry murther, But somewhat was her breathe bereauing. At length he doth possesse her whoale, Her lippes, and all he would desier: And would haue breath'd in her his soale (If that his soale he could enspyer) Eft that chaunc'd which he did requier: A liue soule possest Her matrone brest, Then waking I found sleepe a lyer. ODE 9. [Behold (out-walking in these valleyes)] Behold (out-walking in these valleyes) Where faire Parthenophe doth treade, How ioysome Flora with her dallyes, And at her steppes sweet flowers bredde: Narcissus yellow, And Amaranthus euer redde, Which all her foote-steppes ouer spredde: With Hyacynthe that findes no fellow. Behold, within that shadie thicke Where my Parthenophe doth walke, Her bewtie makes trees mouing quicke Which of her grace in murmur talke: The poplar trees shed teares, The blossom'd Hauthorne white as chalke, And Aspine trembling on his stalke: The tree which sweet franckincense beares. The barren Hebene coalie blacke, Greene Iuy with his straunge embraces, Daphne which scornes Ioues thunder-cracke, Sweet Cypresse set in sundry places: And singing Atis telles Vnto the rest my mistresse graces, From them the winde her glorie chases Throughout the West: where it excelles. ODE 10. [Why doth heauen beare a Sunne] Why doth heauen beare a Sunne To giue the world an heate? Why there haue starres a seate? On earth (when all is donne) Parthenophes bright Sunne Doth giue a greater heate. And in her heauen there bee Such faire bright blazing starres, Which still make open warres With those in heauens degree: These starres farre brighter bee Then brightest of heauens starres. Why doth earth bring forth Roses, Violettes, or Lillyes Or bright Daffadylies: In her cleare cheekes she cloases Sweet Damaske Roses, In her necke white Lillyes. Violettes in her vaynes: Why do men sacrifice Incense to dieties? Her breathe more fauour gaines, And please the heauenly vaynes, More then rich sacrifice. ODE 11. [Louely Maya Hermes mother] Louely Maya Hermes mother Of faire Flora much befrended (To whom this sweet month is comm?ded This month more sweet then any other) By thy sweet souerantie defended. Dazes, Couslippes, and Primroses Fragrant Violettes, and sweet Mynthe Match'te with purple Hyacynthe, Of these each where Nymphes make trimme poses Praysing their mother Bericynthe. Behold an heard of Iollie swaines Go flocking vp and downe the meade, A troupe of louely Nymphes do treade: And dearnely dauncing on yon plaines Each doth in course her hornepype lead. Before the groomes playes Peers the pyper, The bring in Hauthorne and sweet brere, And damaske-roses they would beare (But them they leaue till they be riper) The rest, round morisses daunce there. With frisking gamboldes, and such glee, Vnto the louely Nymphes they hast: Who there in decent order plac'de Expect who shall Queene Flora bee, And with the may crowne cheefly grac'de. The shepheardes poopen in their pype One leades his wenche a country rounde: Another sittes vpon the grounde And doth his beard from driuell wipe, Because he would be handsome found. To see the frisking, and scouping To heare the herdgroomes wowing speeches, Whiles one to daunce his gyrle beseeches, The lead-heeld lazie luskines louping Fling out in their new mottley breeches. This done, with iollye cheare, and game The batchler swaines, and yong Nymphes mett Where in an arbour they were sett Thether (to chuse a Queene) they came And soone concluded her fette. There with a garland they did crowne Parthenophe my sweet true-loue, Whose bewtie all the Nymphes aboue Did put the louely graces downe: The swaines with shoutes rockes Ecchoes moue. To see the roundes, and morisse daunces, The leaden galliard's for her sake, To heare those songes the shepheardes make: One with his hobbie-horse still praunces, Whiles some with flowers an high way make. There in amantle of light greene, Reseru'd by custome for that day Parthenophe they did aray And did create her sommers Queene, And ruler of their merrie may. SESTINE 3.

If you would learne to shedde teares, Or melt away with oft sighes, You shall of me be this taught: As I sit vnder these hilles: Beating myne armes on these hilles, Layd groueling on my leane face: My sheepe of me to bleate taught, And wander through the forrestes. The soddeine windes learne my sighes, Auroraes flowers my teares: But she that should see my teares, Swift skuddeth by the high hilles, And sees me spent with long sighes, And vewes my blubhered leane face, Yet leaues me to the forrestes: Whose solitarie pathes taught My woes, all comfortes vntaught. These sorrowes. sighes, and salt teares, Fit solitarie forrestes: These out cryes, meete for deafe hilles: These teares, best-fitting this face: This ayer, most meete for these sighes. Consume consume with these sighes, Such sorrowes, the to dye taught, Which printed are in thy face: Whose furroes made with much teares: You stonie rockes, and high hilles, You sandie shores, and forrestes, Report my seaes, of salt teares: You whom I nothing els taught, But gronings teares, and sad sighes. ODE 12. [One night I did attend my sheepe] One night I did attend my sheepe (Which I with watchfull ward did keepe) For feare of wolues assaulting For many times the broake my sleepe, And would into the cottage creepe, Till I sent them out haulting. At length me thought about midnight (What time cleare Cynthia shined bright) Beneath I heard a rumbling: At first the noyse did me affright, But nought appeared in my sight, Yet still heard somewhat hat tumbling. At length good hart I tooke to rise, And then my selfe crost three times thrise, Hence a sharpe shephooke raught: I feard the wolfe had got a prise, Yet how he might could not deuise: I for his entrance sought. At length by moonelight could I espye A little boy did naked lye Frettish't, amongst the flocke: I him aproched somewhat nye, He gron'd as he were like to dye, But falsely me did mocke. For pittie he crye'd wella-day, God maister helpe me (if you may) For I am almost starued: I pittied him when he did pray, And brought him to my couch of hay, But gesse, as I was serued. He bare about him a long dart, Well guilded with fine painters art, And had a pyle of steele: On it I looked euery part, Said I, will this pyle wounde an hart: Tuch it (quoth he) and feele. With that I tuch't the iauelinges point, Eft-soones it perced to the ioynt, And rageth now so fierce: That all the balmes which it anointe, Cannot preuaile with it a pointe, But it myne hart will perce. ODE 13. [On the plaines] On the plaines Fairie traynes Were a treading measures: Satyres plaide, Fayries staide At the stoppes set leasures. Nymphes beginne, To come in Quickly, thicke, and three fold: Now the daunce, Now the praunce, Presente there (to behold) On her brest That did best A iewell rich was placed: Flora chose, Which of those Best the measures graced. When he had: Measures lad Parthenophe did get it: Nymphes did chide (When they trye'd) Where the iudgement set it. Thus the sayd, This faire mayd (Whom you gaue the iewell) Takes no pleasure, To keepe measure, But it is too to cruell. ODE 14. [Harke all you louely Nymphes forlorne] Harke all you louely Nymphes forlorne, With Venus chast Diana meetes, And one another friendly greetes: Did you not here her wynde an horne? Then cease fayre Ladyes do not morne. Virgines (whom Venus made offend) Resort into the wood at euen, And euery one shall be forgiuen: There shall all controuersies end, Diana shall be Venus friende. Harke (Nympes forlorne) what is decreede: Spottelesse Diana (must not fayle) But be adrest with Venus vayle, Venus must weare Dianaes weede: This vayle will shadow, when you neede, If any thinke a virgine light Dian'e in Venus vayle excuseth, And her Nymphe Phoebes habite vseth: These queinte attyres befit you right, For each a diuerse garment chuseth. ODE 15. [Vulcane in Lemnos Ile] Vulcane in Lemnos Ile, Did golden shaftes compyle For Cupids bowe: Then Venus did with honnie sweet (To make it please, anointe the pyle: Cupid belowe Dipp'd it in gall, and made it meete Poore wounded creatures to beguile. When Mars return'd from warre, Shaking his speare a farre Cupid beheld: At him in iest Mars shak'd his speare, Which Cupid with his darte did barre Which millions quelled: Then Mars desierd his darte to beare, But soone the waight his force did marre. Then Mars subdue'd, desier'd (Since he was with it tyer'd) Cupid to take it: Nay, you shall keepe it Cupid said, For first to feele it you requir'de: Wound I will make it As deepe as yours: you me did feare: And for that, you shall be fier'd. CANZON 3. [Sweet is the golden couslippe, bright, and faire] Sweet is the golden couslippe, bright, and faire: Tentimes more sweet, more golden, fayre, and bright, Thy tresses (in rich tramell'de knottes) resembling. Venus swannes backe, is louely, smooth, and white: More louely, smooth, and white his fethers are, The siluer lustre of thy browes dissembling. Bright are the sunne-beames, on the water trembling: Much brighter, shinning like loues holy fier On the well-watred dyamondes of those eyes, Whose heates reflection loues affection tryes. Sweet is the sensor, whose fume doth aspyer Appeasing loue, when for reuenge he flyes: More sweet the censor, like thy seemely nose, Whose bewtie (then inuentions wonder h'yer) Nyne times nine muses neuer could disclose. Sweet Eglantyne, I can not but commende Thy modest rosie blush, pure white, and redde: Yet I thy white, and redde prayse more, and more, In my sweet Ladyes cheekes since they be shedde. When grapes to full maturitie doe tende, So round, so redde, so sweet, all ioye before, Continually I long for them therefore; To sucke there sweet, and with my lippes to tuch: Not so much for the muses Nectar sake, But that they from thy lippes there purpure take. Sweet (pardon) though I thee compaire to such. Proude nature, which so white loues doues did make. And fram'd their louely heades, so white, and round: How white and rounde? it doth exceede so much, That nature nothing like thy chynne hath founde. Faire Perles which garnish my sweet Ladies necke, Faire Orient perles oh how much I admire you! Not for your Orient glosse, or vertues rarenesse, But that you tuch her necke I much desier your, Whose whitenesse so much doth your lustre cheeke As whitest Lillyes the primerose in fairenesse: A necke most gorgious, euen in natures barenesse. Deuine rose buddes, which (when spring doth surrender His crowne to summer) he last trophie reareth, By which he (from all seasons) the palme beareth, Faire purple crisped fouldes sweet-dew'de, and tender, Whose sweetnesse neuer weares, though moysture weareth, Sweet ripe-redde strawberryes, whose heauenly sappe I would desier to sucke: but loues ingender A Nectar more deuine, in thy sweet pappe. Oh louely tender pappes! but who shall presse them? Whose heauenly Nectar, and Ambroseall iuyce Proceede from Viollettes sweet, and Asier-like, And from the matchlesse purple Flower-deluce: Round-rising hilles, white hilles (sweet Venus blesse them) Natures rich trophyes, not those hilles vnlike Which that great Monarche Charles (whose power did strike From thartique to th' antartique) dignified With proude Plus vltra, which Cerographye In vnknowne Caracters of victorye Nature hath set: by which she signified Her Conquestes miracle rear'de vp on hye. Soft Iuorie balles, with which whom she lettes play Aboue all mortall men is magnified, And wagers boue all price shall beare away. Oh loues, soft hilles how much I wonder you? Betweene whose louely valleyes, smooth, and straite That glassie moisture lyes, that slipperie dewe, Whose courage tuch'te, could dead men animate: Old Nestor (if betweene, or vnder you He should but tuch) his young yeares might renew, And with all youthfull ioyes him selfe in dewe. Oh smooth white satten, match-lesse, soft, and bright? More smooth then oyle, more white then lillye is, As hard to matche as loues mountes hillye is, As soft as downe, cleare as on glasse sunne-light, To prayse your white my toung too much sillye is: How much at your smooth soft my sence amazed is, Which charmes the feeling and inchauntes the sight? But yet her bright, smooth, white, soft skinne more praysed is. How oft haue I, the siluer swanne commended For that eauen chesse of fethers in her wing, So white, and in such decent order placed, When she the dolye Dirge of death did sing, With her yong mournefull Cygnettes trayne attended? Yet, not because the milke-white winges her graced, But, when I thinke on my sweet Ladyes wast, Whose Iuorie sides, a snowye shadow giues Of her well ordred ribbes, which rise in falling, How oft the swanne I pittied her death calling? With dreerie notes? not that she so short liues, And mongst the muses singes, for her installing, But that so cleare a white should be distayned With one, that for loues sugred torment liues. And makes that white a plague to louers payned. Oh how oft, how oft, did I chide and curse The brethren windes in their power disagreeing? East for vnholesome vapour, South for rayne, North for (by snowes and whirlewindes) bitter being: I lou'd the West, because it was the nurse To Floraes gardens, and to CÅres graine. Yet tentimes more these I did curse againe, Because they were inconstant, and vnstable, In drought, in moysture, frostie cold, and heate, Here with a sunnie smile, their stormie threate: Much like my Ladies fancies variable. How oft with feete did I the marble beate, Harming my feete, yet neuer hurt the stone, Because like her it was impenitrable, And her hartes nature with it was all one? Oh that my ceaselesse sighes, and teares were able To counter-charme her hart, to stone conuerted? I might worke miracles to change againe The hard to soft, that it might row my paine: But of her selfe she is so straitely shirted (Falsely reputing true loue houers staine) That I shall neuer moue, and neuer lye, So many wayes her minde I haue experted: Yet shall I liue, through vertue of her eye.

VVhose heare (downe-spredde in curled tresses) Phoebus his glitter and beames withstood, Much like him when through Cypresses He daunceth on the siluer flood: Or like the golden purled downe Brooched vpon the palm-flowrd wyllowes, VVhich downeward scattred from her crowne Loosely disheuel'd on loues pillowes, Couering her swan-like backe below Like Iuorie match'te with purest gold, Like Phoebe when on whitest snow Her guilded shadow taketh hold. Her forhead was like to the rose Before Adonis prick'te his feete: Or like the path to heauen which goes VVhere all the louely graces meete. Cupids rich chariotte stood vnder, Moyst perle about the wheeles was set, Gray Achate spokes not much a funder: The Axeltree of purest iett. Her seemely nose the rest which grac'de, For Cupid's trophye was vprear'de: T'imperiall thrones where loue was plac'de, VVhen of the world he would be fear'de, VVhere Cupid, with sweet Venus sate: Her cheekes with rose, and lillyes deck'te, Nature vpon the coache did wate, And all in order did direct. Her cheekes to Damas eroses sweet In sent, and colour, weare so like: That honnie-bees in swarmes would meete To sucke, and sometimes she would strike VVith daintie plume the bees to feare, And being beaten they would sting: They founde such heauenly honny theare, Cupid (which there sate triumphing) VVhen he perceiu'd the bee did sting her, VVould swell for greefe, and curse that bee More then the bee that sting'd his finger: Yet still about her they would flee. Then loue to Venus would complaine Of nature, which his chariot drest: Nature would it excuse againe Saying she then shew'd her skill best. VVhen she dronke wine vpon her face Bacchus would daunce, and spring to kisse, And shadow with a blushing grace Her cheekes, where louers build there blisse: VVho when she dranke would blush for shame, That wanton Bacchus she should vse, VVho Venus brother might defame Her, that should such acquaintance chuse. What glosse the scarlet curtaines cast On a bed-steede of Iuorie, Such like, but such as much surpast All glosse, her cheekes did bowtisie. Her roseate lippes, soft louely swelling, And full of pleasure as a Cherry: Her breath of deuine spices smelling, Which with toung broaken, would make merry Th' infernall soules, and with her voyce Set heauen wide open, hell gates shut, Moue melancholye to reioyce, And thrall'de in Paradice might put. Her voyce not humaine when she speaketh, I thinke some Angell or goddesse (Into cÅlestiall tunes which breaketh) Speakes like her, with such chearefulnesse. All byrdes, and instrumentes may take There notes deuine, and excellent, Mellodious harmonie to make From her sweet voyces least accent. This we loues sanctuarie call: Whence sacred sentences proceede Rould vp in soundes Angelicall, Whose place sweet nature hath decreede Iust vnder Cupids' trophye fixt: Where musique hath his excellence, And such sweetes, with loues spirite mixt, As please farre more then frankincense, Thence issew forth loues Oracles Of happinesse, and lucklesse teene, So straunge be loues rare miracles In her, as like haue neuer beene. Her necke that curious axeltree, Pure Iuorie like, which doth support The gloabe of my Cosmographie, Where, to my Planettes I resort To take Iudiciall signes of skill, When tempestes to myne hart will turne, When shoures shall my fountaines fill, And extreame droughtes mine hart shall burne: There in that gloabe, shall I perceiue, When I shall finde cleare element, There, gloomie mistes shall I conceiue Which shall offende the firmament, On this my studies still be bent, VVhere euen as riuers from the seaes In braunches through the land be sent, And into crooked sinewes prease Throughout the gloabe such-wise the vaynes Cleare Christalline throughout her necke, Like sinuous, in their crooked traines VVildely the swelling waues did checke. Thence rise her humble seemely shoulders, Like two smooth pullish't Iuory toppes, Of loues cheefe frame, the chief vphoulders VVhiter then that was of Pelops. Th?ce Cupids fiue-graind-mace out bra?cheth, VVhich fiue-fold, the fiue sences woundeth, VVhose sight, the minde of lookers launcheth, VVhose force, all other force astoundeth. Thence to that bed, where loues proude Queene In silent maiestie sweet sleepeth: VVhere her soft louely pillowes beene, VVhere Cupid through loues conduictes creepeth. Pillowes, of Venus turtles downe Pillowes, then Venus turtles softer, Pillowes, the more where loue lyes downe, More couetes to lye downe, and ofter: Pillowes on which two sweet rose buddes, Dew'de with Ambrosiall nectar lye, VVhere loues milke-way, by springs, &amp; floodes Through violet pathes, smooth slideth by. But now with feares, and teares proceede Loues place of torture to declare, VVhich such calamitie doth breede To those, which there imprisoned are. VVhich once in cheanes are neuer free, Which still for want of succour pyne, Dry sighes, salte-watrie teares which bee For daintie cates, and pleasant wine: Immur'de with pure white Iuorye, Fetters of Adamant to draw Euen steele it selfe (if ir be nye) A bondage without right, or law: With poore ActÃ¦on ouerthrowne But for a looke: and with an eye (In his cleare armes) loues sergeant knowne Arrestes each louer that goes by. This is her hart, loues prison call'de, Whose conquest is impregnable, Whence who so chaunce to be in thrall'de, To come forth after are vnable. Further to passe then I haue seene, Or more to shew then may be told, Were too much impudence I weene: Here therefore take myne anchor hold, And with the Romaine Poet deeme Partes vnreueal'de to be most sweete: Which here describ'de might euill beseeme, And for a modest muse vnmeete. Such blessed morninges seldome bee, Such sightes, too rare when men goe by: Would I but once, the like might see, That I might dye, before I dye. SESTINE 4.

ODE 18. [Oh that I could make her whom I loue best] Oh that I could make her whom I loue best, Finde in a face with miserie wrinckled, Finde in an hart, with sighes ouer-ill-pynde, Her cruell hatred! Oh that I could make her whom I loue best, Finde by my teares, what maladie vexeth, Finde by my throbbes, how forceably loues darte Woundes my decayde hart!

SONNET CV. [Ah me how many wayes haue I assaide] Ah me how many wayes haue I assaide To winne my mistresse to me ceaselesse suite? What endlesse meanes and prayers haue I made To thy faire graces euer deafe and mute? At thy long absence like an errant page With sighes and teares long iourneyes did I make, Through pathes vnknowne in tedious pilgrimage And neuer slept, but alwayes did awake. And hauing founde the ruthlesse, and vnkinde: Soft skinn'd, hard-harted, sweet lookes, voyde of pittie: Ten thousand furies raged in my minde Chaunging the tenour of my louely dittie: By whose enchaunting sawes, and magicke spell Thine hard indurate hart, I must compell. SESTINE 5. [Then, first with lockes disheueled, and bare] Then, first with lockes disheueled, and bare, Straite guirded, in a chearefull calmie night: Hauing a fier made of greene Cypresse woode, And with male franckincense on alter kindled I call on threefould Hecate with teares, And here (with loude voyce) inuocate the furies: For their assistance, to me with their furies: Whilst snowye steedes in coach bright Phoebe bare. Ay me Parthenophe smiles at my teares, I neither take my rest by day, or night: Her cruell loues in me such heate haue kindled. Hence goate and bring her to me raging woode: Hecate tell which way she comes through the woode. This wine aboute this aulter, to the furies I sprinkle, whiles the Cypresse bowes be kindled, This brimstone earth within her bowelles bare, And this blew incense sacred to the night. This hand (perforce) from this bay this braunche teares. So be she brought which pittied not my teares. And as it burneth with the Cypresse woode So burne she with desier by day and night. You goddes of vengance, and auenge-full furies Reuenge, to whom I bende on my knees bare. Hence goate, and bring her with loues outrage kindled. Hecate make signes if she with loue come kindled. Thinke on my passions Hec'ate, and my teares: This Rosemariene (whose braunche she cheefely bare And loued best) I cut both barke and woode, Broke with this brasen Axe, and in loues furies I treade on it, reioycing in this night: And saying, let her her feele such woundes this night. About this alter, and rich incense kindled This lace and Veruine to loues bitter furies I binde, and sirewe, and with sadde sighes and teares About I beare her Image raging woode. Hence goate and bring her from her bedding bare: Hecate reueale if she like passions bare. I knitte three true loue knottes (this is loues night) Of three discolour'd silkes, to make her woode, But she scornes Venus till her loues be kindled, And till she finde the greefe of fighes and teares: Sweet Queene of loues for mine vnpittied furies, A like torment her with such scaulding furies: And this turtle (when the losse she bare Of her deare make) in her kinde did shed teares, And mourning did seeke him all day, and night: Let such lament in her for me be kindled, And mourne she still, till she runne raging woode: Hence goate and bring her to me raging woode. These letter's, and these verses to the furries (Which she did write) all in this flame be kindled: Me (with these papers) in vayne hope she bare That she to day would turne mine hopelesse night, These as I rent, and burne, so furie teares. Her hardned hart, which pittied not my teares. The winde shaked trees make murmure in the woode, The waters roare at this thrise sacred night, The windes come whisking still to note her furies: Trees, woodes, and windes, a part in my plaintes bare, And knew my woes, now ioy to see her kindled: See whence she comes with loues enrag'd and kindled! The pitchye cloudes (in droppes) send downe there teares, Owles scritche, Dogges barke to see her carried bare, Wolues yowle, and cry: Bulles bellow through the wood, Rauens croape, now, now, I feele loues fiercest furies: See'ste thou that blacke goate, brought this silent night Through emptie cloudes by 'th daughters of the night? See how on him she fittes, with loue rage kindled, Hether perforce brought with auenge-full furies? Now I waxe drousie, now cease all my teares, Whilst I take rest and slumber neare this woode: Ah me! Parthenophe naked and bare, Come blessed goate, that my sweet Lady bare: Where hast thou beene (Parthenophe) this night? What could? sleepe by this fier of Cypresse woode Which I much longing for thy sake haue kindled, Weepe not, come loues and wipe away her teares: At length yet, wilt thou take away my furies? Ay me, embrace me, see those ouglye furies. Come to my bed, least they behold thee bare And beare thee hence the will not pittie teares, And these still dwell in euerlasting night: Ah loues, sweet loue, sweet fiers for vs hath kindled, But not inflam'd, with franckinsense, or woode, The furies, they shall hence into the woode, Whiles Cupid shall make calmer his hot furies, And stand appeased at our fier's kindled. Ioyne ioyne (Parthenophe) thy selfe vnbare, None can perceiue vs in the silent night, Now will I cease from sighes, lamentes, and teares, And cease (Parthenophe) sweet cease thy teares: Beare golden Apples thornes in euery woode, Ioyne heauens, for we conioyne this heauenly night: Let Alder trees beare Apricockes (dye furies) And Thistles Peares, which prickles lately bare. Now both in one with equall flame be kindled: Dye magicke bowes, now dye, which late were kindled: Here is mine heauen: loues droppe in steede of teares. It ioynes, it ioynes, ah both embracing bare. Let Nettles bring forth Roses in each woode, Last euer verdant woodes: hence former furies: Oh dye, liue, ioye: what? last continuall night, Sleepe Phoebus still with Thetis: rule still night. I melt in loue, loues marrow-flame is kindled: Here will I be consum'd in loues sweet furies. I melt, I melt, watche Cupid my loue-teares: If these be furies, oh let me be woode! If all the fierie element I bare Tis now acquitted: cease your former teares, For as she once with rage my bodie kindled, So in hers am I buried this night. FINIS. TO THE RIGHT NOBLE Lord, Henry Earle of Northumberland. Deigne (mightie Lord) these verses to peruse Which my blacke mournfull muse presenteth here, Blushing at her first entrance in for feare, Where of her selfe, her selfe she doth accuse. And seeking Patronage, bold meanes doth vse To shew that dewtie, which in hart I beare To your thrise noble house: which shall out weare Deuouring time it selfe, if my poore muse Deuine aright, whose, vertuous excellence She craues her ruder stile to patronise. Voutch-safe then (noble Lord) to giue defence: Who (when her brighter glorie shall arise) Shall flye to fetche fame from her fort of brasse, VVhich with your vertues through the world shall passe. TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE MOST renowned and valiant, Robert Earle of Essex, and Ewe, &amp;c. Voutchsafe (thrise valiant Lord) this verse to reade, When time from cares of more importe permittes, The too deare charge of mine vncharged wittes: And that I do my lighter muses leade To kisse your sacred handes, I myldely pleade For pardon, where all gracious vertue sittes. Since time of yoare there Lordes first fruite admittes My bashfull muse (which lost her mayden-head In too deare trauell of my restlesse loue) To you my Lord her first borne babe presentes, Vnworthie such a patrone for her lightnesse: Yet deigne her zeale, though not the light contentes, Till from your vertues registred aboue, To make her loue more knowne, she borrow brightnesse. TO THE RIGHT NOBLE AND VERtuous Lord, Henry Earle of Southampton. Receaue (sweet Lord) with thy thrise-sacred hande Which sacrea muses make their instrument, These worthlesse leaues, which I to thee present Sprong from a rude and vnmanured lande: That with your countenance grac'de, they may withstande Hundred ey'de enuies rough encounterment, Whose patronage can giue encouragement To scorne back-wounding Zoilus his bande. Voutch-safe (right vertuous Lord) with gracious eyes Those heauenly lampes, which giue the muses light, Which giue, and take in course (that holy fier) To vewe my muse with your iudiciall sight, Whom when time shall haue taught by flight to rise, Shall to thy vertues of much worth aspyer. TO THE MOST VERTVOVS LEARned and bewtifull Lady Marie Countesse of Penbrooke. Pride of our English Ladies, neuer match'te, Great fauourer of Phoebus of-spring, In whom euen Phoebus is most florishing, Muses cheefe comfort, of the muses hatch'te: On whom Vrania hath so long time watch'te, In fames rich forte with crowne triumphing, Of laurell euer-greene in lustie spring, After thy mortall pilgrimage dispatch'te. Vnto those Planettes where thou shal't haue place With thy late sainted brother to giue light: And with harmonious SphÅres to turne in race. Voutch-safe sweet Lady with a forhead bright To shine on this poore muse, whose first borne fruite That you of right would take, she maketh suite. TO THE RIGHT VERTVOVS AND most bewtifull Lady the Lady Straunge. Sweet Lady might my humble muse presume Thy bewties rare perfection to set out, (Whom she pride of our English court reputes) Ambitious she would assume To blazon, euery where about Thy bewtie, whose dumbe eloquence disputes With fayre loues Queene, and her by right confutes. But since there is no doubt But that thy bewties prayse, which shall consume Euen time if selfe exceedeth All Bryttish Ladyes, deigne my muses suites Which vnacquainted of your bewtie craues Acquaintance, and proceedeth T'aproche so boldly, and behaues Her selfe so rudely, daunted at your sight As eyes in darkenesse, at a suddeine light. TO THE BEAVTIFVLL LADY THE Lady Brigett Manners. Rose of that garlande, (fayrest, and sweetest Of all those sweet and faire flowers: Pride of chast Cynthias rich crowne,) Receaue this verse, thy matchlesse bewtie meetest: Behold thy graces which thou greetest, And all the secret powers Of thine and such like bewties, here set downe, Here shalt thou finde thy frowne, Here thy sunnie smiling, Fames plumes flye with thy loues which should be fleetest, Here my loues tempestes, and showers. These read (sweet bewtie) whom my muse shall crowne, Who for thee such a garland is compyling (Of so deuine sentes, and colours) As is immortall, time beguiling. Your bewties most affectionate seruant. BARNABE BARNES.</field>
