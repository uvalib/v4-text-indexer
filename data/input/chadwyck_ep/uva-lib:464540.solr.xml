      <field name="fulltext">[All cristen men both more and les] Passio domini nostri ihesu Christi secundum Marcum. Matheum. Lucam &amp; Iohannem. All cristen men both more and les Þat in þis werld here wonand es, Aw forto think both day and night And to haue minde with mayn &amp; might, How ihesu crist, oure god so gude, Boght vs with his precius blude, And sufferd ded for oure misdede. Herto suld ilkaman tak hede, And loue him euer both loud &amp; still, Þat slike kindnes wald schew vs till. And for þe passioun of ihesu crist Es medeful forto be puplist, And nedful to all cristen men Clerely forto kun and ken, Þarfore þus es it ordand here, In iglische land men forto lere. Als haly writ witnes &amp; sais, Ihesus fasted fourty days, Ensample forto teche vs to fflesly penance forto do. Þan þe fende þat es oure fa ffand þat he had fasted swa, He hoped þat he had hunger grete And sune suld faly for faut of mete. To wildernes he went in hy And temped oure lord god almighty; He knew no thing of his godhede, Þarfore he went with owten drede, To ger him wirk sum werkes wrang, By cause þat he had fasted lang. Bot he þat gouernes gude and ill, And all þis werld may weld at will, Sufferd fanding of þe fende And answerd euer with wordes hende, To gif vs cause and enchesoune To suffer here sere temptacioune Of þe fende and of oure fless And of þe werld þat wikked es, And euer stabilly forto stand And noght faintly to be failand. So sal we get þe victory Of þe fende oure fals enmy, Als ihesus þare ouer come þe fende And at his will þeþin gert him wende. Efterward þan þus bifell, Als witnes beres in oure godspell; It neghed nere þe tyme sertayne Þat crist in erth suld suffer payne. Þe wordes wex ful wonder wide, Of his werkes on ilka syde, ffor ouer all in þat cuntre He gert dom speke &amp; blind men se, And drafe out deuils fra men bidene, And oþer signes þat oft war sene; And als for lazar þat he raised, Many of þe folk ful fast him praysed. Bot þe iews had grete enuy And said he ferd all with foly, And fast þai ordand þam omell How þai might best his ferlis fell. Þe iews gert to geder call Þe pharisews and princes all, And all þe maisters of þaire laws, And þus þan said þai in þaire saws: Si dimittimus eum sic ‘omnes credent ei’ Þai said omang þam euer ilkane: “If we lat him þus furth gane, Al þe folk sal trow him in, And þan sall oure laws blin; Romanes and folk of vnkouth land Sall fetche oure folk out of oure hand And do vs dole till we be dede, And mak maistries here in oure stede.” Cayphas was þaire bisschop þan; Thurgh prophecy þus he bygan And said vnto þe princes all: “Ne wate ?e noght what will byfall? A man bus vnto dede be broght So þat all folk peris noght.” Þus he said thurgh prophecy Þe ded of crist to signify, Bot of him self he said it noght; Þe haly gaste þir wordes wroght To proue þat crist, god sun mighty, ffor sinful man in erth suld dy. A grete feste þan come nere hand, Þat pash was named in þat land, And all þai said he suld be slane Als sune als þaire fest war gane; And all assented to habide Till it war passed þat high tide, So þat nonkins noys suld rise, Ne no wonder on [non vise, ffor in þat time it wald noght seme Any man to ded at deme. And when þe fest dais war fulfild, Right als crist him self wild, He drogh him to þe same cete Whare he wist he suld demed be. He cald of his desciples twa And bad þat þai suld smertly ga To þe cete þat bifor þam stode, And þus he said with milde mode: “Twa bestes bifor ?ow sall ?e finde And baldly sall ?e þam vnbind, And vnto me þat þai be broght; And if any say to ?ow oght, Sais ?owre maister of þam has nede, Þan sall þai suffer ?ow gude spede.” Þe apostels went with hert glad And all þai fand als ihesu bad; Þai broght vnto him bestes twa Ane asse with hir fole alswa, Þaire clathes þai laid with owten lett And ihesu seþin obouen þai sett, And he rade vnto þe towne; Þai kepid him with processioune And did vnto him grete honowre, Als þaire souerayne and sauiowre. Bot in all wirschip þat þai did Enuy ay in þaire hertes war hid. Bot neuer þe les, in þat ilk day, With owten harme he went oway ffra þe folk full of enuy, And toke þe way to bethany. Crist and his men?e mild &amp; meke Went to þe toun rest forto seke. Þai come vntill a gude mans hows, Þat named was symon leprows, And als þai at þaire supere sat, Mari maudlayne come in þat, And vnto crist fast gan scho cry And for hir misdedes asked mercy. Doune scho fell and wesche his fete With þe teres þat scho grete, And seþin scho dried þam with hir hare, And for hir sins scho murned sare. Ane oynement with hir scho broght, Þat was of precius thinges wroght; And þarwith scho enoynted him, Als men may find bifor þis time In þe last godspell saue ane to luke, Þat sett es bifore in þis buke; Bot proces clerely to declare, Here I sall ?it muster mare. Als scho enoynt him, heued &amp; fete, And honord him hir bales to bete, Þe oynement went obout full wide In þe hows on ilka side. And ane of þam þat was þare in Cumberd was in sorow and syn; Iudas scariot was his name, Þat seþin soght his lord with schame; He wald þat vnement sald had bene, And þus he said to þam in tene: “Me think,” he said, “we do right ill Þis oynement þusgat forto spill. We might haue salde sone onane And thre hundreth penis tane, And þat might haue done mekill gude To be gifen to pouer men fode.” Bot for pouer men said he it noght, On his awin winyng was his thoght; ffor he hade all þaire tresore hale And þe tende to him self he stale; Þarfore him thoght bath scath &amp; scorn Þat þis oynement so was lorn. Ihesus þat can all kounsail knaw, Answerd softly to þat saw: Pauperes semper habetis me autem non semper habebitis. “Pouer men,” he said, “sall ?e haue, Almus of ?ow forto craue; Att ?owre will ?e may þam gif, And I sal noght lang with ?ow lif. Þe werk þat þis woman has wroght Euer mare sall be on thoght; Scho dose ful wele, lat hir allane, Hir dede in minde sal euer be tane.” When iudas herd þir wordes meke, His awin sorow fast gan he seke, And vnder in his hert he thoght: “Al þis sal availe þe noght, Vnto þe iews I sall þe sell ffor al þe tales þat þou can tell.” Vp fra þe supere right he rase, And graithly to þe iews he gase, and al togeder sune he fand Þe maisters of þe iews land, And of þaire princes grete plente, And vnto þam al þus said he: Quid uultis michi dare &amp; ego eum uobis tradam‘ “What will ?e gif me vnto mede, And to ihesu I sall ?ow lede? Vnto ?ow now sell him will I, Sais if þat ?e will him by. I wate with him ?ow greues sare, And I wald þat ?e venge ware.” Þe iews vnto him wele gan lith, And in þaire hertes þai warful blith, And sune þai said þai vowched saue To gif him what so he wald craue; He asked of þam in þat stownde Threty plates of penis rownde; Vnto his saw þai all assent And hastily made þai his payment. Þus for his lord þat tyme toke he Threty plates of þaire mone, He was wele paid and so war þai, When þis was done he went his way. Quare ihesus uendebatur: pro xxx denariis. Here may men þe enchesun here, whi it bifell on þis manere, Þat oure lord ihesu was salde ffor threty penis plainly talde, And nowþer for les ne for mare; Þe verray cause I will declare. Iudas, als we haue herd here, When þai sat at þaire sopere Al samen in symondes leprows hall, And mari to ihesu fete gan fall With her vnement precyows, (Þe odore went ouer al þe hows) Þan iudas thoght, als it es kend, Þat þis vnement was euill despende, And said þat it suld haue bene salde Thre hundreth penis to haue talde. He was cumberd in couatyse And þarfore said he on þis wise; ffor al þat þai had forto spend was halely gifen in to his hend, And in his bagges obout he bare Al þaire tresore les and mare, And of all þat come to þam twelue, Þe tende euer toke he to him selue. In litel purses euer he stale Þe tende of þaire tresore bi tale, Þat broght he euer vnto his wife; Þus cursedly he led his life. And if þe oynement les &amp; mare Had bene sald, als he said are, ffor thre hundreth plates fully, Þan suld him self haue had threty, Þat of thre hundreth es þe tende. Þat thoght he wele with him suld wende, ffor þe tende to him self he toke Of all þaire siluer, so sais þe boke; And for þe tende cumes to no mare Of thre hundreth, als I said are, Bot to threty, als es said biforn, So mekill thoght [him þat he had lorn Þat suld haue cumen into his walde. Þarfore his maister so he salde And asked nowþer more ne les, Bot þat þe tend of thre hundret es, Þat es threty, trewly to tell. When þis was done he wald noght dwell, Bot to his felows he went ogayne, ffor þai suld trow in him no trayne. Bot oure lord ihesu wist full wele How he had done euer ilka dele; ?it said he noght, bot held him still, fforto perfourne his fader will. Þe fest of pasch come nere at hand And ihesu crist was trauailand, And sum of his desciple dere Said to him on þis manere: Ubi uis paremus tibi pascha. “Whare wiltou we puruay a place In forto hald þe fest of pasch? Say till vs, &amp; we sall wende To mak redy whare þou will lende.” Þan ihesus answerd sune onone, And cald vnto him peter &amp; iohn: “Wendes,” he said, “&amp; ?e sall mete A man with water in þe strete; Waites whare he beres þe water in And folous him, for no thing blin. Þe lord of þe hows sall ?e finde, A rightwis man of nobill kinde, And vnto him þan sal ?e say Þat I cum walkand in þis way. And sais þat I will in his hall Rest me and my men?e all, ffor þe tyme now neghes nere Omang my frendes to mak sopere; Now with my men?e will I make Þis fest of pasch my leue to take. Gose þeder now and graithes oure mete Of slike gude als ?e may gete.” Þan þe apostels peter &amp; iohn Vnto þe cete went onone. Al þai fand als ihesu bad, And graithed þaire mete with hert glad, Swilk als þai fand in þe cete ffor þaire maister and his men?e. Þan ihesus and his men ilkane In þat hows þaire ins has tane. Ihesus bad þam all sit doune And to his biding war þai bowne; Als he ordand with his worde, Doune þai sat all at a burde, And iudas wald no langer lett, Bifor his lord euyn he him sett. When þai war sett at his biding, Mete he bad þai suld furth bring. Mete and drink þan furth þai broght And ete and drank whils þam thoght. Al if iudas with ihesu satt, His treson no thing he forgat, Bot euer more he thoght on ane Þat he suld [be his maister bane. Ihesus toke brede þat lay him by And blisced it ful bowsumly, And seþin he brac it with his handes And to his men þus he cumandes: “Ettes,” he said “now of þis brede, It sall ?ow saue fra euill ded. It es my fless þat I ?ow gif, Whar thurgh ?e may þe better lif.” Seþin he toke þe wine clere And blisced it with milde chere, And when he had gifen his blising, He said þus to þam ald and ?ing: “Drinkes of þis drink, it dose ?ow gude. Þe drink of life, it es my blode. Þis body þat ?e here se, ffor ?ow sall bitraied be, fforto clens ?ow clene of syn And oþer mo þat er þare in. Als oft als ?e þis fude sal take, Minde of me þan sall ?e make A law vnto ?ow sall it be, Þat I will ?e lere of me. With ?ow now sall I ett no mare Vntill I haue bene wide whare, Ne of þis drink I sall noght taste Till I haue walked waies waste, And till I drink with ?ow ful euyn In þe kingdom of my fader in heuyn, ffor nedes it bus fulfilled be Als haly writ witnes of me; With tresun sall I be bitrayd, And seþin ded and in laire laid And to life sall I rise ogayne; So sal men se þe suth sertayne. Sum of ?ow has bene to balde, Þat vnto þe iews has me salde, Ane of ?ow has me forsaken And for me er þe penis taken, And wa bese done vnto þe man Þat þis treson first bigan. I warn him now fully biforn Him war better haue bene vnbron.” When his desciples herd þis tale, In þaire hertes bred mekill bale, And fast þai loked omang þam all On wham þis foul defaut suld fall, And ilkone by þam self serely Said þusgat: “lord, es it oght I Þat swilk treson has puruaid?” Þan Ihesus answerd sune and said: “Ane of ?ow þat with me ettes, To fill his wamb he noght forgetes, He sittes here, als ?e may se, Thurgh wham I sall bitraied be.” Iudas, when he herd þis worde, Vp he rase right fra þe burde, And all on heght þus gan he cry, Nunquid ego sum rabi;With grete voice þus cried he: “Maister, menes þou oght by me?” Ihesus said, “þi wordes witnes, And þi self sais þat þou it es.” At þa wordes was iudas tene, And furth he went fra þam bidene Vnto þe iewes with wikked will, His first falshede to fulfill. Iohannes videbat secreta celestia‘ Als saint iohn at þe soper sat, Mete &amp; drink both he forgat; He lened doun to ihesu breste, ffor he sat him alþer neste, Vnto carping he toke no kepe, Bot hastily he fell on slepe. Ane angell toke his gast ful euyn And bare it to þe blis of heuyn, And þare þe angell lete him se Many a selkuth preuete. Of god him self he had a sight Whare he was in blis ful bright, And in þat sight he had knawing Of many a preue heuynly thing. He was ful wise of wittes gude, Al þat he saw he vnder stode, And when he wakend of his slepe, Vnto it all he toke gude kepe, And all he wrate it in a buke, Clerkes clerely opon to luke; Al þe wonders he wrate I wis, Þe buke es cald apocolipsis, Þat es, þe buke of preuete, Als saint iohn gan in heuyn se. Now [of þe buke we speke na mare, Bot turn ogain þar we left are. Als ihesus sat þare at þe clath, His desciples wex all wrath. Omang þam made þai contek grete And fast bigan to striue and threte, Whilk of þam suld maister be Omang þam moste of dignite fforto rewl þam euer ilkane, If ihesus suld be fra þam tane. Ihesus wist wele al þaire will, And all þaire striueing wald he still, Bifor þam gert he bring a childe, Þat ?ong was and of maners milde. And when þe childe stode þam omang, “Me think,” he said “?e wirk all wrang Þis striueing helpes ?ow right noght, Put slike pointes out of ?owre thogh[t] Als milde and meke bihoues ?ow be Als es þis childe þat ?e here se. He þat him haldes highest of all Titest sall fra his power fall, And he þat beres him law &amp; still In werld he sall haue all his will; ffor no man may here with maistri Bere him high with owten enuy. I am redy to serue ?ow all Als ?owre seruand and ?owre thrall. Ensawmple sall ?e tak by me Ilkone till oþer bowsun at be. ?e sal haue anger, hete I ?ow, Als I sall suffer for ?ow.” Þan said he more with milde mode Vnto saint peter þare he stode: “Peter,” he said “þou ert ful meke, A milder man thar no man seke, When þou sall se þat I am taken And with all my frendes for saken And sent furth to suffer payne And þou be turned fra me ogayne, Conforth þou þi breþer all Þat none of þam in fanding fall.” Al þis he talde to þam in fere Als þai sat at þaire sopere. Lauacio pedum discipulorum‘ Sune when ihesu had said þis worde, Vp he rase right fra þe burde And toke a clath with milde chere And a bacyn with water clere; Þe clath he girded him with all And on his knese down gan he fall Bifor peter with wordes swete, And said þat he wald wass his fete. Peter answerd and said, “nay, Þat will I noght by none kins way, It fals noght maister vnto me Slike seruise forto tak of þe.” Þan said ihesus: “bot I do þis, Þou gettes no part with me in blis.” Þan said peter and oþer ma: “Þat blis, lord, lat vs noght forga, Wasche heuid and hend lord pray we þe, So þat no thing vnwaschen be, Bot all clene þat bifore was filde, So þat we in þi blis may bilde.” Þan ihesus þam wesche and wiped bath, And seþin dried þam with þe clath. When þai war [waschen albidene, He sett him doun þam al bitwene. When he was sett þan said he sone “Noght ?e knaw what I haue done, Ne noght ?e wate what will bifall. Maister and lord now ?e me call And wele ?e say for I am so. And ?it I haue kneled ?ow vnto And wasschen ?owre fete all on raw, So þat ?e sall ensample knaw Meke and bowsun forto be, Ilkone till oþer with hert fre, And serue ilkone vntill oþer Als to ?owre fader or ?owre broþer. Ensaumple þus to ?ow I gif fforto be meke ay whils ?e lif; Luf ilkone oþer in word &amp; dede, And in heuyn sall ?e haue ?oure mede. Al þat suffers here for me Sorow [ore or bale, what so it be, He sall haue welth with owten end, In lastand life with me to lend.” Þan spak ihesus þam vntill: “Þe tyme es cumen I sall fulfill Als prophettes has witnest of me; Now bus it all fulfilled be. ffor ?owre sake suffer sall I Sorowes sere and seþin dy. And þis day sall ye be adred, When I sal be fra ?ow led; ffra me ful fast sal ?e fle And sum of ?ow forsake me. ffor prophettes in þaire bukes write And sais, ‘þe hirdman sall I smyte And al þe folk oway sal fle.’ Þis es all ment by ?ow and me, I am þe hird and ?e my schepe, I sall be tane or tyme of slepe; ffor ?ow now sall I suffer ded Thurgh iudas and þe iews rede; And wit ?e wele þan on all wise Þat þe thryd day I sall vp rise, And hale and sownde ?e sall me se In þe land of galyle; And when it falles on þis manere, Thinkes how I haue said ?ow here.” Peter, when he herd þis tale, In his hert had mekill bale. He said, “sertes, þat sall noght be, Lord, we sall neuer fra þe fle. I sall wende with þe whare þou gase And nowþer leue for frendes ne fase, Al trauaile with þe will I take And wende to presoun for þi sake, And with þe will I suffer dede; No man sall reue me þat rede.” On þis wise said þe apostels all Þat with him war þare in þat hall. When ihesu all þaire wordes herd, Vnto peter þus he answerd: “Þou sais þat þou sal folow me, And, peter, þus I say to þe Þat, or þe kok haue krawin thrise, Sall it worth opon þis wise, Þat my name saltou deny And fast forsake my cumpany, And so sall all þat with me ere. Bot þou þi self sall athes swere And witnes take with tales vntrew Þat þou neuer bifore me knew.” Peter þan held him ful still And no thing durst he say þar till, Bot in his hert he had grete thoght How swilk wonders suld be wroght. Ihesus þan with wordes fre Said vnto all his men?e: “ffor dout of þam þat will ?ow dere, Swerdes sall ?e all bere, He þat hase nane his kote he sell, And by a swerde kontek to fell.” Þan answerd ane þat stode him nere: “Lord, lo, twa swerdes er redy here, And oþer wappins redy graide.” Þan ihesus answerd sune and saide: “Þat es inogh, vs nedes no mare. Bot cumes now furth and lat us fare.” Þan oure lord ihesu mighty Toke þe way toward bethany, And als þai went vnder a hill, Ihesus said his desciples vntill, “Here I bid þat ?e habide, Whils I wend here a l[i]tell biside. Þare haue I sum dele forto sayne, When I haue said I cum ogayne.” De oratione christi super montem‘ Ihesus left his men?e þare, And fra þam furth þan gan he fare; With him he toke desciples thre, And no ma of all his men?e, Peter and Iohn &amp; Iamis, his broþer, Ilkone lufed he more þan oþer. ffurth he led þam by þat strete Vnto þe mownt of oliuete, And when þai come nerehand þe hill, Als it was his awin will, Þan he sayd vnto þam thre: “Here ?e sall habide me And slepes noght, bot luke ?e wake, Þat no temptaciounes ?ow take. My hert has dout &amp; dredes ill, ffor angers þat er cumand me till.” He went and left þam þare allane, Þe lenkith of kasting of a stane, And on þat hill fer fra þe toune Opon his knese he kneled doune, And þare he prayed with milde steuyn Vnto his fader highest in heuyn: “ffader,” he said, “if it may be, Lat þis paines pas fra me. And noght anly als I will craue, Bot, fader, als þou vowches saue; ffor I am redy loud and still, In worde and werk to wirk þi will.” ffor dout of ded he had slike drede Þat angers vnto his hert ?ede, And for grete greuance he grett And both water and blude he swett. Þe dropes fell doun on þe grounde, So was he angerd in þat stownde. Þan come þare doun ane angell bright ffleand fra þe heuyn on hight, To comforth him opon þat hill, Als it was his faders will. When þis was done, þan gan he wende Ogayne to his desciples hende. To his trauail toke þai no kepe, Bot ilkone war þai fallen on slepe, And when he saw þai sleped all, Peter first he gan vp call. “Þis,” he said, “es noght þe dede Þat I ?ow cumand when I ?ede. Might ?e noght ane oure with me wake, Sum of my sorow forto slake? Wakes and prayes to heuyn king, So þat ?e fall noght in fanding.” When he had said þir wordes sertayne, Vnto þe hill he went ogayne, Þat he [by fore was cumen fra, His prayers eftsones forto ma. He kneled and prayed with heuy clere, ffor his tyme was cumand nere, Vnto his fader of heuyn he prayde Þe same wordes he byfore had said, Þat þe paynes might flit him fra, If his fader wald suffer swa. Seþen he rase and went onane To his desciples, þai slepid ilkane. Þan he wald noght on þam call, Bot went and left þam slepeand all. Þe thrid tyme ogayne he ?ede, His erand fully forto spede, Doun he kneled on þe hill And þus he said his fader vntill: “ffader, I haue serued no ded, Bot wirk I will efter þi rede. If it may none oþer be, Do now all þi will with me.” Þan rase he vp and toke þe way To his desciples þare þai lay, And vnto þam he said in hy: “Slepes and restes now hardily, ffor þe tyme es cumand nere Þat ?e sall suffer sorows sere And all if ?e haue sleped wele, Iudas has sleped neuer a dele. To sinful men he has me salde To suffer bale, þat be ?e balde. Rises vp now for my sake, Þai er cumen þat me sal take. And peter now I kounsail þe Þat þou be redy forto fle, ffor sathanas es noght ?owre frende, He will ay seke ?ow forto schende. Bot I haue praied my fader fre, Þat mekill es feld of his powste; And þarfore, peter, haue no drede, He sall noght dere þe in þi dede. Þarfore of me what so bifall, Comforth þou þi breþer all.” Capcio christi cum iudeis‘ Ivdas, ful of fraud and gile, was with þe iews all þat while, And ordand by þam self allane How þat he might best be tane. And [iudas said: “I sall ?ow lede To find him wele with owten drede, And when I haue broght ?ow him till, Þan may ?e wirk with him ?owre will.” Þan þe iews so fell and kene Spac to iudas þam bitwene: “Say vs how we sall him knaw, ffor sum of vs him neuer saw, And if he be omang his men, Say vs how we sall him ken. Þan þe traitur kene and balde Þis taken vnto þam he talde And said: “of him ?e sall noght mis, Takes þe man þat I sall kis. Laies ?owre handes on him in hy And ledes him [fast furth preuely.” Þan þai come with ful grete rowte And vmsett ihesus all obout With swerdes &amp; maces &amp; glaues gude; Þai blew hornes als þai war wode And in lanternes bare þai light, And sum bare brandes brinand bright Þat þai might graithly se þe gat, ffor it was in þe euenig late. Ihesus wist alway full wele Þat was to cum euer ilkadele. To wende with þam it was his will And on þis wise he said þam till: “Tels vnto me al in fere Wham ?e seke on þis manere?” Þai answerd and said albidene: “We seke all ihesu nazarene.” Þan ihesu said with wordes fre, “I say ?ow suthly I am he.” And als he said þir wordes right He schewes þare sum dele of his might, And so [he stond þam in þat stownde Þat doun þai fell all to þe grownde, And still þai lai and dared for drede Vntill he withdrogh his godhede. Þan rase þai vp and stude full still And ihesus said eftsones þam till: “Wham seke ?e þus als ?e haue gane?” And eft þai answerd euer ilkane: “Ihesus nazarene we seke.” Þan answerd he with wordes meke: “I said ?ow suthly I am he, ffra ?ow I will no ferrer fle.” Þan godhede to þam schewed he nane, ffor tyme was cumen he wald be tane, And vnto þam þan þus said he: “Sen it es so þat ?e seke me And of ?owre seking will noght ses, Lattes my men?e pas in pese.” Iudas come þan vnto him right And kissed him als he had hight; “Haile, maister,” vnto him he said. Þan handes sune on him þai laid And omang þam stode he still And lete þam wirk with him þaire will. Þan said ihesus vnto Iudas: “Sen þou þis treson procurd has, And sen þi self ordand all þis, Wharto cums þou me to kis? Þou bitrais thurgh þi kising Mans sun þat may weld al thing.” When his desciples saw þis fare, In þaire hertes þai had grete care; Ilkone said oþer vnto: “Allas what es vs best to do? Better bote es none þan fle, ffor if we dwell here dede be we.” And so þai fled fra him ilkone, Al bot saint peter and saint iohn. Peter wend wele to haue done And out he drogh his swerd sone, Vntill a iew þan smate he þare And his right ere of he schare; And þat same iew was seruand Vnto þe bisschop of þe land, And malcus sais men þat he hight And in a lantern bare he light. When ihesus saw þis dede was done, Vnto peter þus said he sone: Mitte gladium tuum in uaginam. omnis enim qui gladio percutit gladio peribit. “Put vp,” he said, “þi swerd ogaine, ffor he þat slase he sall be slane, And he þat smites with swerd, Iwis Thurgh swerd he sall peris. Wenes þou noght and I wald craue Þat I fra heuyn might helping haue? Haue I might, and I wald send, ffra my fader me to defend Sexty thowsand of angels bright. Þan suld þir men haue litill might, My party þan I might maintene Ogains þir iews þat er so kene; Bot þan might noght fulfilled be Þe wordes þat er wretin of me, Als witnes beres þe prophecy Þat sais of me þat I sall dy, And sen so es my fader will, Al þat þai said I sall fulfill.” Ihesus þan stowped doun þam biforn And toke þe ere þat was of schorn, He went to him þat was bledand, And helid it with his haly hand, He made it hale als it was are. Bot þarfore ?it wald þai noght spare, Tite þai toke him þam bitwene And band him als he thef had bene. Þan ihesus said to þam in fere, “Als a thef ?e bind me here, And cumes with swerdes &amp; glauies grete Als a thef me forto bete, And forto dere me þat ?e may. ffairer it war haue done by day, ffor ilka day ?e haue me sene In ?owre temple ?ow bitwene Techand þe law to ilka man; Whi wald ?e noght tak me þan? Bot þis tyme falles vnto ?ow right In mirknes forto proue ?owre might.” Vnto his wordes toke þai no hede, Bot furth with him þai went gude spede And led him so omang þam all Vntill þai come to kaiphas hall, ffor þare þe iews abad all still Till ihesus was broght þam vntill. ffor ferd all his desciples fled, When þaire lord was fra þam led, Þai fled and left þaire lord allone Al bot saint peter &amp; saint iohn; And ?it þai durst noght negh him negh, Bot folowd efter euer on dregh, And graithly held þe same gate Vntill þai come to cayfas ?ate. Saint iohn sune was laten in þore, ffor he was knawin lang bifore, and peter stode allane þar out, In his hert he had grete dout. Saint iohn spak to vsscher þan, ffor he was knawen wele with þat man, And so þai spak bitwene þam two Þat peter was laten in also, And both biheld with dreri mode Vnto þaire maister þare he stode, Bihind þe folk ay gan þai hone To wait what suld with him be done. Þus als þai stode omang þe rout, Iohn had a mantell him obout, Þe iews thoght it was all wrang Þat he stode so þam omang, Sum of þam hent him by þe lap Þat he suld noght oway schap. And when he saw þai wald him take, His mantell was him leuer forsake, ffra þam stert he in a tene And left þe mantell þam bitwene. Vnto þe dore he toke þe gate And preuely he past þe ?ate, ffurth he went with hert sore, Þarin durst he cum namore. Acusacio iudeorum contra Ihesum All þis tyme þan ihesus stode Omang þe iews ful milde of mode, And none of þam might find him in Thing þat suld sown in any sin. And sum þat stode þare him biside Said þus in grete tene þat tide: “Þis man þat standes omanges ?ow Has said þat he may neuer awow, Þat if men kest doun in a thraw Oure mekill temple þat ?e wele knaw, He sais þat him self suld it raise Righ vp ogayne within thre dayse Hale to be bath tre and stane, Þis will we witnes euer ilkane.” Cayfas, when he herd þis saw, And oþer, als þai sat on raw, Said to ihesu þar he stode: “Think þe þat þis plaint es gude? What answer willtou gif till vs Of þam þat þe acuses þus?” Ihesus stode still and answerd noght, ffor he was angerd in his thoght. Caiphas þan bigan to cry And spac to him despitusly: “I coniore þe thurgh god lifand Þat þou me tell to vnderstand If þou be god sun of heuyn.” Ihesus answerd with milde steuyn: “Þou sais þi self þat I am he, And sertanly I say to þe In heuyn blis men se me sall With my fader þat weldes all, To deme ilk man efter þaire dedes, He es noght wise þat dome noght dredes. Bot all if I þus to ?ow say Þat I am goddes sun verray, ?e er so ful of enuy now Þat my tales ?e will noght trow; And also if I it deny, ?e will noght leue me now forþi.” Þe iews answerd and said on raw: “Þan ertow god sun bi þi saw?” He answerd and said mildely: “?e say þat goddes sun am I.” When cayphas herd þat he so said, Of þa wordes he was noght paid, His awin clathes he rafe for tene, And seþin he carped wordes kene. Quid ad huc desideramus testimonium He said vnto þe iews all: “Wharto suld ?e more witnes call? He grantes omang vs all full euyn And sais he es god sun of heuyn. Sen he it grantes till vs ilkane, Oþer witnes nedes vs nane; And þarfore sais, what es ?owre rede?” Þai said all he had serued dede, And in þe face þai gan him smite And spit opon him for despite, And euer ilkone on sides sere Missaid him on fowl manere. Peter stode ay in þe flore And saw how foul þai with him fore, To buffet him war þai ful balde. And þe weder was wonder calde, Þarfore þe iews had made a fire In þe flore brinand ful chire. When peter saw þe fire so clere, Als he durst he drogh him nere, Omang þe iews he stode ful still And warmed him at his awin will. Þan sum of þam þat stode biside Spac to peter in þat tide And said: “felow, whare had we þe Ertou noght ane of his men?e?” De negacione petriPeter answerd sone onane And said: “gude man, þou has misgane, In þi wordes wrang þou wenes, I am noght þe man þat þou of menes, Ne, sir, I wate noght what þou sais Of þis thing þou to me lays.” A maiden stode þare þam biside And herd þam so to geder chide; When scho saw peter in þe face, Þir wordes said scho in þat place: “Sertanly he þis es ane Þat with ihesu was wont to gane.” And vnto peter said scho þen: “Þou ert ane of þe prophettes men, And bi þi sembland may we se Þat þou ert man of galile, And by þi speche men may þe knaw.” Þan peter answerd with grete aw, And athes vnto þam he sware Þat he saw ihesu neuer are. He saw his gabing might [not gain, He wald haue bene oway ful fayn, And preuely he toke þe gate Bitwene þe seruandes and þe ?ate. And sone þat man come him biforn Þat he had his ere of schorne, He was ane of þe bisschop men. Him thoght þat he suld peter ken, And fast bigan he forto threte And spak vnto him wordes grete: “ffelow,” he said “ertou noght he Þat my right ere reft fra me when we come þi maister to take? Þis mater may þou noght forsake, Þi maister helit it als it was, ffor he wend so oway to pas. By þis cause right wele I ken Þat þou ert ane of his men, And now it sal wele ?olden be, Þe dede þat þou did þare to me.” Þan peter stode and dred him sare, Euel him thoght þat he come þare And þus he said with sorow strang: “Man of me þou menes wrang, fful wrang on me here þou þe wrekes, I knaw him noght þat þou of spekes.” And sune, when he had said þis sawe, Þe kokkes onone bigan to crawe, And ihesus, als he bunden stode, Biheld peter with milde mode, ffor þi þat he suld vnder take How he said he suld him forsake. And sune, when peter persaiued so Þat his lord luked him vnto, In his hert als sune it braid How þat ihesus had to him said Þat he suld deny him on þat wise Or þe kok had crawin thrise. And when he wist how he had wroght, He was ful drery in his thoght, And fra his enmis þat þar ware He wan þar out and weped sare; And furth he went with simple chere, And more he durst noght negh þam nere. Ihesus þan with milde mode Bifor sir cayphas bunden stode, And he oposed him of his lare And of his meruailes les &amp; mare, Of his desciples he spird alswa, Wheder þai war went him fra. He said: “tell here in oure present Of þi werkes als þou has went, ffor þe techeing suld noght be hid, Þat aght forto be knawen and kyd.” Þan ihesus answerd in þat tide And said: “my wordes walkes wide, ffor I haue spoken in ilk cuntre Plainly and noght in preuete, And in þe temple haue I bene Oft siþes, als ?owre self has sene, Whare þe iews all and sum Comunly vses forto cum; Of my werke may þai witnes bere, Ill or gude wheþer þai ere. Wharto askes þou me þis thing? Ask þam þat has herd my techeing, ffor þai wate what my wordes ware And forto tell þai will nogh spare, And þarfore ask þam of my lare, ffor me saltou wit nomare.” A lurdan þan of [þe iews lay And herd ihesus þir wordes say, Vp he stirt þare strif to eke And smate ihesu opon þe cheke; With grete bir to him he brayd And þir wordes to him he said: Sic respondis pontifici ‘ He said, “whi answers þou so Þe bisschop þat spekes þe vnto? Lad, we sal þe lere nurtoure To answer men of grete honoure.” Ihesus stode als it es wreten And luked on him þat had him smeten; He said to him: “what ailes þe? fful wrangwisly þou smites me; If þat my wordes be out of skill, Þan may þou bere witnes of ill; And if my wordes rightwis ware, Whi suld þou þan smite me so sare?” Þan sir cayphas and Anna And oþer maisters many ma Spac to ihesu all in fere, And asked of him ensamples sere; Þai said all to him: “tell vs þis, If þou be cumen fra heuyn blis?” Ihesus said: “it es no bote: Ogains so many forto mote, Or to mak speking ?ow omell, ffor ?e trow nothing þat I tell. Bot men sall se, so may bitide, Me sitand [bi my fader side, And all þe powste sall be myne At deme men to ioy or pine; Þan I sall þaire dedis deme Þat now er faine me forto fleme.” Þus when he had þir wordes said, Þe iews war all ful euill paid. Sum of þam fell doun him biforn And made grete hething him to scorn; Þat þai war kene ful fast þai kid, ffor with a clath his face þai hid And buffet him full bitterly. And þus þai said with grete enuy: Prophetiza nobis Christe: quis est qui te percussit ? Þai said þus: “tell vs, if þou wate, Whilk of vs es þat þe smate; If þou kan oght of prophecy, Tell þe suth till vs in hy, Rede whilk of vs smate þe now, If þou will we on þe trow.” Ihesus sufferd with gude will Al paines þat þai wald put him till; And so þai fore with him þat night Vnto þat it was day full light, And þan þai said he suld be ded. Bot þe maisters gaf to rede Þat þai suld graithly tak þe gate Vnto þaire prince hows, sir pilate; With owten him þai durst noght do Thing þat touched þe corun to, ffor he was man of grete maistri And domes man in þe iury. Vnto þis sune þai all assent, And furth to sir pilate þai went. Now of iudas will I tell, Of his falshede how it bifell. He folowd euer, als he moght, To wit what þai with ihesu wroght. And when þai him to pilate led, Þan wist he wele he had euill sped; And in his hert þan wele he thoght, Þat he ful wikkedly had wroght, And in wan hope he fell ful sone ffor þe dede þat he had done. Mercy of crist wald he nane craue, ffor whi he hopid nane forto haue; Bot in his hert wele he thoght To les his payn if þat he moght, And forto saue his maister life, Þat he had made so mekil strife, And al þat bale forto abate. Sune he went to sir pilate, When all þe iews war [sammen sett, To luke if he þat strif might lett. Þat crist suld pas, ful fast he prayd, And on þis wise to þam he sayd: Peccaui; tradens sanguinem iustum. “Sirs, suthly I haue sind,” he said, “A rightwis blude I haue bitrayd, Mi maister falsly I forsoke When I of ?owre mone tok; Here bifor ?ow all grant I, I haue bitrayd him tratursly And all sakles I haue him salde. My tene es turned many falde; Þarfore I pray ?ow lattes him pas, And here ?owre mone als it was I gif it here to ?ow ogayne, So þat he be noght sakles slayne.” Þan answerd þe iews kene And said vnto him all in tene: “If þou haue trispast him vnto, Þar of haue we no thing at do. Byse þi self als þou has wroght And cheuis þe we charge it noght. If þou haue done till him vnright, On þi self mun fall þe plight; We wist noght whare obout þou went, Ne here was nane þe efter sent. And when þou him vntill vs salde, ffaire mone for him we talde, Þan was þou paid and so war we, Now may þare none amendis be.” When iudas saw it was no bote More of þis mater for to mote, Als he þare bifor þam stode, He quoke for wa als he war wode; ffor bale he thoght þat he might brest And noght he wist what bote war best. Þe plates of payment þat he toke, Out of his lap sone he þam schoke, And kest þam doun bifor þaire fete, ffor he wend so his bale to bete. Bot all his speking was in vaine, Þai said all ihesu suld be slaine. And he saw þai wald noght spare, He went and left his mone þare, Preuely he past þam fra And thoght him seluen forto sla, He thoght his wikkednes was so grete Þat forgifnes might he none gete. Þe fende entyred him fast þar till; So in despaire him self to spill, Vntill a place he went allane Whare he might be his awin bane, And in þat place of preuete He hanged him on a hillir tre. His wambe clef þan euyn in twa, And his entrailes so fell him fra, And þare his gast so ?olden was, ffor at his mowth it might noght pas. Þis was þe caus, als clerkes wist, ffor þi þat his mowth [had crist kist, Þarfore it was with owten dout Þat his saul at his wambe went out. And life and saule bath was forlorn, Better him war haue bene vnborn; Þus for his sin his saule was schent, To wa with owten ende he went. Þus when iudas hanged was And his saule to pine gan pas, Þe iews saw þe plates rownd Þat he had kasten on þe grownd. Vnto þam þai went full right And toke þam vp with hert light. Sight of þe mone made þam glad, ffor wele þam thoght þai won it had. And what profet þarof might rise, Ilka man said on his wise, What þai suld with þe siluer do. Sum said so and sum said so, Þat it suld sauely be vp laid; Sum answerd þarto &amp; þus said: Non licet mittere in corbanan; quia precium sanguinis est. “It aw noght to be done þan Omang oure tresore in corbanan, Ne to be halden in tresori, ffor it prise of felony.” Þan þai toke þaire hale consail To luke how it might moste avail, And hastily þai euer ilkane Sune assented all on ane With þat mone to by a land, Euer more to hald in þaire hand, fforto do iews to ded þar in, Al þat suffer ded for sin, And pilgrims þar in forto graue, And oþer þat þai vowched saue. When þai had ordand on þat wise Sune þai made marchandise, Þai boght þe mount of caluery Ay forto be in þaire baily, And als sune in þat ilk place To hang men þai made a space. Þat siluer was ful wabigane, So ful of syn was neuer nane; ffirst it was for ihesu talde, When iudas to þe iews him salde, And seþin a felde þar with was boght Whare on ihesus to ded was broght. Þat ilk place with mayn and mode Þe iews gert call þe felde of blude, And so þat ilk place cald þai ffro þat tyme ?it vnto þis day. Now of iudas lat we be, And of ihesu more speke we, How he with enmis was vmsett And furth bifor sir pilat fett. Acusacio iudeorum ante pilatum‘ Þe iews bigan ihesu to wreghe Vnto pilate with many a lighe; Þai said: “we haue bifor þe broght A man þat mekill wa has wroght, And with his wonders warn we ?ow He turnes þe folk on him to trow. And ?it þare es anoþer thing, He sais þat he es iews king, And þat es ogains þe honoure Of sir Sesar oure emperoure. And he sais þat he es god sun And þat he sal in heuyn won. Swilk er his wordes, wele we knaw.” Þus þai said ilkone on raw; Sir pilate þan with milde mode Said vnto ihesu þare he stode: “Þou ert king þan, wele wate I, Of vs and of all þis iewry?” Ihesus answerd him vnto: “Þou sais þi self þat I am so.” And when þe iews þir wordes herd, ffell als any fire þai ferd, And ilkone of þam on sere side Accused him kenly in þat tide. He answerd noght, bot held him still And lete þam say of him þaire will. When pilat saw he answerd noght, He was ameruailed in his thoght And vnto ihesu þus said he: “Heres þou noght how þai sai to þe, And how þai wregh þe ilkaman? Excuse þi self now if þou can.” Ihesus stode still and answerd noght, So þat pilat grete meruail thoght, And þus he spac with voice stowt Vnto þe iews þat stode obout: “What can ?e tell vnto þis man? Defaut in him none find I can Ne caus in him can I find nane Wharfore þat he suld be slane.” Þan þe iews bigan to cry To him ogaine with grete enuy And said, “he turnes oure folk vs fra In þis land and in oþer ma, So þat fra vs þai went oway, And turnes þam to trow his lay, So þat oure laus he loses clene Ouer all whare he has bene. Slike wonder werkes he wirkes ay, And moste opon oure sabot day; And he defendes þe folk ayware Trouage to pay to sir sesare; Þat has he done fra þis cete Right to þe land of galile.” Þan pilat cald þe princes all, And all þe consail gert he call fforto enquere of þam ilkane If crist fra galile war gane. “Wittes,” he said, “and warnes me If he be gane fra galile, ffor sertainly, if it be so, Þan wate I what I haue to do: Sir herod es lord of þat land And haldes þe kingdom in his hand; And if he come fra þat cuntre, His demeing falles noght vnto me, ffor I will do no pregidise Vnto heroude on none wise.” Þan said þe folk: “we vnderstande Þat he es cumen out of þat land And þare he soiourned for sertayne.” Þan said pilat to þam ogayne: “Vnto sir herod sall ?e wende And gretes him wele with wordes hende And sais him how þat I him send Þis man oure frenschip forto mend, And forto deme effter his will, Wheþer him likes to spare or spill.” Þan [armed men has vnder tane Till herod graithly forto gane. Misso ad herodem Þe men þan letted for no thing Vnto þai come to herod king; And when herod might vnderstand Þat þe prophet was cumand, And þat he wist he suld him se, Grete liking in his hert had he; ffor he had couait of lang tyme ffully forto speke with him, And forto wit how þat it ferd Of ferlis he bifore had herd. Þe knightes come to herodes hall, And on þaire knese doun gan þai fall, Þaire message to him forto tell Of all þe fare, how þat it fell. When herod herd he was full glad And ioyful þat he ihesu had; He said: “sir, welkum in all thing, I haue oft couait þi cuming. I thank him þat þe heþer send, ffor mekill þou may my mirth amend; And als his men?e wisely wate, We haue full lang bene at debate; Now [all my greuance I for gif, In luf to last ay whils we lif. And sen þou ert so sent to me, Schew me sum point of þi pouste; ffor oft I haue herd tell tithing Þou has done many selkuth thing: Þou gers blind se on sides sere, Þe dom to speke, þe defe to here, Croked men þou has gert gang, And raised ded men oft omang; Do now for þe luf of me Sum selkuth singne þat I may se.” Ihesus stode still and answerd noght, Of herodes rede no thing he roght; What so euer he said him till, He wald noght speke, bot stode ay still. And at þe last had herod tene, And meruailed him what it might mene, And sone he sayd: “bot if þou speke, With wa I sal me on þe wreke.” Þus with wordes he gan him threte, And seþin he bad þai suld him bete. Þan þai bet him in þat stede And said ilkane he suld be dede. When he was bet so in þat hall, And scorned both of grete and small, He sufferd all þaire werkes ill, And no word wald he say þar till. Þan herod gert for grete despite Cleth him all in clathes white, And seþin he said: “I him forsake, ?e þat him broght ?e sal him take, And sune ogayne ?e sal him lede. Here schewes he nowþer word ne dede, And þarfore in þis tyme for me To ded sal he noght demed be; Bot bid sir pilat wirk his will, Wheþer he will him saue or spill, Luke him self what him es leuir, My gude will grant I him for euer.” Et facti sunt amici herodes &amp; pilatus nam inimici erant adinuicem‘ ffrendschip was made þus þam bitwene Þat fase ful lang bifore had bene. Þe kneghtes þan þai toke þe gate Plainely vnto sir pilate; With gude tithinges þai made him glad, How þat he herodes frendschip had, And all þai tald him les and mare, How þat þai war welcumd þare; Þai said: “he sendes ihesus ?ow to, All ?owre will with him to do, And sais he fendes in him no gilt, Wharfore þat he suld be spilt.” When pilate herd all how þai said, In his hert he was wele paid, And sune he gert to geder call Þe princes and þe maisters all, And said: “for soth, ?e er to blame, Þat ?e do ihesu all þis schame, ffor no cause can I in him find, Wharfore men suld him bete &amp; bind; And lo, ?e se I haue him sent Till herod forto tak iugement, And cause in him can he find nane Wharfore þat he suld be slane, Þarfore me think it war foly So giltles forto ger him dy. ffor þi I rede, if ?e will swa, We chastise him and lat him ga. ?e knaw þe custum in þis land Of þis pasch þat es cumand; If any man be in presoune ffor manslaghter or for tresoune, Oure custum will þat he go fre ffor þis grete solempnite.

Sir pilate was aparty greued, ffor þai cried so in his heuid; Þarfore he led ihesu þarout And asked him thinges þat war in dout, And ihesus answerd him alway To ilka thing þat he couth say; Þai spac of maters more &amp; myn. And þan þe iews þat war with in, Þe maisters and þe princes all Þat still war leued in þe hall, Toke a counsail þam bitwene, How þai might do ihesu tene, Þat þai wald a deliuerance haue Of a man whilk þai wald craue. Þai had in presoune ane barabas, Þat man mortherer and traitur was; “Deliuer we him,” þai said ilkane, “And so sall ihesu sune be slane.” Þus þai assented more and myn; And sone by þis come pilat in, Ihesu also he broght in þan, And doun he sat als domes man, And þan he said þe iews vnto: “What will ?e with ihesu do? Lo, I haue led him furth ?ow fra, Allane forto asay him swa, And in him can I find right noght, Wharfore he suld to ded be broght ffor þi, if ?e do efter me, Ihesus sall deliuerd be.” Þan þe iews war euil paide, And þus þai answerd sone &amp; said: Non hunc sed baraban Þai cried and said, “sertes, nay, Ihesus sall be ded þis day. We haue ane baraban þe thef, Deliuer him þat es vs lefe, And by oure custum him we ass, ffor ihesu sall on none wise pas.” Þus þai cried euer ilkane, And said þat ihesu suld be slane. Þan pilat herd þaire hedose cri, And still he sat in a stody, He wist noght what war best to do, Ne what he suld answer þam to. De diabolo &amp; vxore pilati‘ Þe fals fende ful of enuy Persayued and wist þan weterly Þat if ihesus to ded war broght, Man saul suld with his blude be boght, And wele he hoped þat he suld tine All þat war with him in pine. Þarfore fast he him bithoght fforto lett it if he moght; A treson thoght he forto do, If he might cum wele þarto. Als ane angell he went bi night Preuely to proue his might, And forto saue so ihesus life He went vnto sir pilat wife, In hir bed als scho slepeand lay, And vnto hir þus gan he say: “Wakin dame &amp; speke with me, Of þi harm I will warn þe, And als I bid, luke þat þou do, So þat no harme cum þe vnto. Go bid þi lord for any rede Þat ihesu be noght done to ded, ffor sertes þai sall be schent ilkane Þat procures now to haue him slane; Tane he es ogains resoune, With wrang þai hald him in presoune; Þe wa with owten end he wan Þat þis treson first bigan; And þarfore warn þi husband now Þat no harm cum vnto ?ow.” When þis was said to pilates wiue, Out of hir slepe scho rase biliue, Vntill hir lord scho toke þe way, All þe soth to him at say; In to þe halle biliue scho come, Als sir pilat sat in dome. “Sir,” scho said, “take tent to me, ffor I am sent to warn þe Þat þow trow noght þe iews rede fforto do ihesu to ded. He es a man of mekill might, Þat has bene tald to me þis night; Ane angell full greuose and grim Has turment me to night for him, And bad þat þou no thing suld do Þat in euil towches him vnto, Bot ordan in al þat þou may Þat he be safe and wend his way. So bad he þat me warned has, (þe fende I wate full wele it was) fful hidosly he manast me ffor ihesu sake, so did he þe, And said he suld be þaire enmy Þat procurd ihesu forto dy; And sir, I was neuer so adred Sen I was of my moder fed. Þarfore sen we er warned bath, Lat ihesu scap with owten scath And wend his way whare so he will With owten drede, els dose þou ill.” When pilat herd þir wordes all, Al þe maisters gert he call, And þe bisschoppes of þaire law, And vnto þam he said þis saw: “I se ?e er obout to spill A man þat es with outen ill, And lat se, sais vnto me sone What euil dedes he has done.” Þan answerd þai euer ilkane And said vnto him sone onane: “With his word þis fals ihesus, Ouer all he sclanders vs, And sais to ilk man opinly Þat he has of vs maistry, ffor king of iews he gers him call; Þat semes als we suld be his thrall, And, sir, þat gase noght wele obout, To mak vs all his vnderlout.” Pelat, when he þaire malice knew, Þus he said vnto ihesu: “Þai luf þe noght, þat se I now, Bot to þaire sayinges what sais þou? Þine awin folk, als þou may se, Has bitraied þe vnto me, And for me might þou pas in pese If þai wald of þaire saws sese; Þine awin folk and þi bisschoppes bath Er most about to do þe scath, And þat it es noght lang on me, Þat saltou sone þi seluen se.” Sone he sþac till a squiere, And bad he suld bring water clere; And when þe water was to him born, He wesche his hend þe folk biforn, And seþin dried þam on a clath, fforto excuse him self of scath. Bot all if he þis werk so wroght, Anoþer in his hert he thoght; And when he had on þis wise done, Vnto the iews he said ful sone: “I schew vnto ?ow albidene Þat in þis cause I will be clene, And of þe spilling of his blode; ffor he es rightwis man and gude.” Þan þe iews with grete debate Answerd þus to sir pilate: Sanguis eius super nos &amp; super filios nostros “His blude,” þai said, “on vs be sene, And on oure childer all bidene; We pray þat all þe perill fall On vs and on oure childer all.” When pilate herd all how þai said, He lete als he war euil paid, And vnto ihesu þus he spac: “How likes [þe þis þai mak? Al halely hald þai þe ogain, To sla þe es þaire purpose plain; ffor þou vses oþer lawes Þan has bene vsed in are dawes.” Ihesus þan answerd als him thoght: “Of all þaire greuance gif I noght; Bot here I will mak no maistri, In oþer stede es my baily, Mi regne es in þe heuyn light, And þarof sal ?e neuer haue sight, My regne es noght of þis werld here, Whare noght es sene bot sines sere. And if my regne in þis werld ware, With angels þat in heuyn er þare I might haue help þan at my will To wreke me on ?owre werkes ill; Bot þan might noght fulfilled be Þe wordes þat er wreten of me, And als it es my faders will And his asent I sall fulfill.” Sir pilat said: “þan ertou king, Þat se I wele by þi saying, And in þis werld þou has maistri.” Þan answerd ihesus to him in hy: “Sir, sen þou sais þat I am so, Here in þis werld I haue to do, ffor in þis werld here was I born; I come to seke þat war forlorn, And no fals athes forto swere, Ne no fals witnes forto bere, Bot [all falsshed forto refuse, And alkins rightwisnes to vse. And al þat lufs here rightwisnes, Lufes my waies both more and les.” Pilat þan, als man amaid, Answerd to him þus and said: Quid est veritas “Sen þat þou so suthfast es, Say me what es suthfastnes.” Ihesus þan ful still he stode, And answerd nowþer ill ne gude, So þat pilate grete wonder thoght. What he might say þan wist he noght, Bot wele he thoght so als he sat Þat he to þe iews bud say sumwhat. He said: “I rede ?e lat him ga To his cuntre þat he come fra, And lat þam iustifi him þare, And moue vs now with him nomare.” Þan þai cried all to pilate: “And þou lat him gang þusgate, Sen he so wikkedly has wroght, Cesare frend þan bese þou noght; ffor wha so makes him self a king, He gainsaise cesar in all thing. Deliuer vnto vs barabas, And do him als he serued has.” When pilate herd þaire grete enuy, Þat [þai toke cesar to party, Þan he dred him mekill mare To liuer him þan he did are. All þe folk on ilka side ffast vnto sir pilate cried, And said þat ihesus hy suld hang, And barabas all qwite suld gang. Þan pilat gan a falsshede feine, Als he wald þaire will ateyne; Ihesu to þam deliuerd he, And bad þat he suld beten be. Þan þai toke him þam bitwene, And [band him als he thef had bene; Al his clathes fra him þai kest, And till a peler fast him fest, And scourges kene þai ordand þare To bete opon his body bare. Ilkone obout þai bete him fast Ay whils [any scourge might last, Vntill his body als he stode Was couerd all ouer in blode. And so when he was al for bled, With clathes of purper þai him cled, So forto scorne him þar with all, And on þaire knese doun gan þai fall, Sayand to him in þaire hething: “Haile ihesus, of iews king. ?e er araid in riche atyre, ffor ?e say ?e er lord and syre.” Þan þai gederd thornes kene, And made a corowne þam bitwene, And on his heuid þai it thrast, On ilka side þe blude out brast; With staues of rede þai set it doun, And clapped it fast [vntill his crowne, So þat þe thornes went in þan Till þai perced þe hern pan; Þe thornes made þe woundes wide, Þe blude ran doun on ilka side, And þan als sone þe blude keleing Gert his clathes fast to him cling. When he was þus with rewth araid, Þan pilat to þe puple said: “Vnto ?ow furth I sall him bring, So þat ?e sall haue knawing Þat I in him can find right noght, Wharfore he suld to ded be broght.” Als ihesus þare bifor þam stode, ffra heuid to fete all famed of blode, Þan said pilat to þam bidene: “Lo, here þe man þat ?e of mene.” And þan þe iews so kene and prowd Answerd and cried all full loud, Crucifige crucifige eum Þat es to mene all with a voyce Þai cried: “deme him to hang on croyce.” When pilate all þaire wordes herd, Vnto þam sone þus he answerd When pilate herd how þe tale ?ede, In his hert þan had he drede, And, for þai on him set slike schout, Eft he led ihesus þar out, And said to him: “I meruaile me Þat þou biddes no man help þe. Wheþin ertow? what es þi name, Þat may suffer so mekill schame? And sen þou sese we may þe saue, Mercy of vs may þou craue, And ask forgifnes of vs all, Þe better þan may þe bifall.” Ihesus vnto þis answerd noght. Þan said pilate: “what hastou thoght? Deynes þe noght to answer me? Whils þou es in my pouste? Wate þou noght wele þat I may Ger þe be ded þis ilk day? I may anely with my voyce Deme þe to be hanged on croice, And als it es in my powere To lat þe pas and mak þe clere, So þat þou sall noght be slaine; Al þis es in my power playne.” Ihesus þan answerd als him thoght: “Of all þi powere rek I noght, ffor power hastou nane of me, Bot þat es granted vnto þe, Þi might es gifen to þe ful euyn ffra my fader þat es in heuyn; ffor þi to me þou has no might, Bot þat es gifen vnto þe right. Þarfore þou es gretely to blame, Þat þou dose me so mekill schame, Bot his sin es mekill mare, Þat me bitraied vnto þe are.” When pilat herd þir wordes all, He led ihesus in to þe hall, And at his might ymagind he Þat ihesus suld deliuerd be; And doun on sege he sett him þan Omang þam all als domes man. Þe stede whare þai suld domes hald, Lichostratos þe iews it cald, In þaire tong þai named it swa, And in ebrew, golgatha. Þan said pilat to þam in hy: “Lo, here ?owre king of ?owre iewry.” Þai cried ogaine all with a voyce: “Deme him tite to hang on croyce.” Þan said pilat on his hething: “Will ?e þat I cros ?owre king?” Þan answerd al þe iews kene And said [vnto him al in tene: Nos non habemus regem nisi cesarem. Þai said: “we wate wele euer ilkane Þat king bot cesar haue we nane. And grante vs now for cesar sake Baraban fra presoune forto take, And lat him quit of oure hand, ffor þis fest þat es cumand.” Pilat said: “sen ?e will so, What will ?e þan with ihesu do?” Þan answerd þat euil men?e And said all: “he sall hanged be; Gif him dome al we þe pray, ffor sertes he sal be ded þis day.” Pilat forgat his awin astate And ferd he was for þaire debate, (His state was rightwisnes to ?eme And rightwisli ilk man to deme) His state he toke no tent vntill, Bot demid al efter þaire will; And all efter þaire wordes wrang He demid him on rode to hang, And barabas þan cumanded he ffra presoun suld deliuerd be. Þan als ihesu stode in þe rout, fful sternely stirt þai him obout; Þe purper clath þat he in stode, Was hardend all with his awin blude, So þat it cleued on ilka side fful fast both vnto flessche &amp; hide; Þai rugged it of with outen rest, When it so to þe fless was fest, Þat with þaire tuging in þat tide Al bled eft sones both bak and side, And so þan was þis secund paine ffeller þan þe first for sertayne. His awin clathes þan gan þai take, And kled him in for schame sake. Þan þai swore als þai war wode Þat he suld hing high on a rode. Þe dome es gifen dampned es he, And ?it haue þai no rode tre; Ilkone of þam till oþer spak, Whare of þai a cros might mak, And how it of þat cros bifell, Al þe suth I sall ?ow tell, And how þat it come first in place, Listens now a litell space. De morte primi parentis Ade &amp; de incepcione crucis christi‘ When adam oure form fader dere, Was of elde nyghen hundreth ?ere, And þarto þan he kend Þat his life drogh nere þe end; Þan said he vntill eue: “þou sall All my suns bifor me call, Þat I may blis þam or I dy.” And als he bad, scho did in hy; Scho cald [þam] vnto him þat tide, Þai come and stode all him biside, Als he in his sekenes lay, And vnto him þus gan þai say: “ffader, what harm es þe on hand, Þat þou es in þi bed ligand, And wharto hastou cald vs heder?” Þan said he to þam al to geder: “Suns,” he said, “I far ful ill, Of pine and sorow I find my fill.” And þai answerd and said ogaine: “ffader, tell vs what es payne, And how it es sorow to haue, Say vs þe suth, so god þe saue; ffor whils we in þis werld haue bene, Of sekenes haue we seldom sene.” Þan said seth: “for suth I trow, ffader, þat þou ?ernes now Of paradis fruit forto ett mare, Of þe whilk þou has etin are, And þarfor ligges þou sorowand swa; Bot say to me and I sall ga Sone vnto paradis ?ate, And I sall grete þare in þe gate; I sall mak site and sorows sere, And so I hope god sall me here, And send sum angell me to gete Sum of þat fruit þat þou wald ett.” Adam vnto seth þan telles: “I ?erne no fruit, ne nothing els, Bot I haue dole with owten dout, And euil in al my lims obout.” Þan said seth and þai all bidene: “We wate neuer what euil es to mene; Tell vs what thing þe greue þus, Wharto suld þou laine fra vs?” Als he lay þan þus said he: [“Al my suns herknis to me. When god had made me with his will, ?owre moder þan he made me till; In paradis sone he vs sett, And gaf vs leue al fruit to ett; He outtoke no thing bot a tre Þat he forbed bath hir and me, In middes of paradis it stode, And was knawing of ill &amp; gude. Þe est he put in my powste And þe north at my will to be, And till ?owre moder he toke þat tide Bath þe west and þe sowth syde; And twa angels he toke vs till, Vs forto were fra alkins ill. Till on a tyme, sons, suth to say, Oure angels went fra vs oway, Bifor god þaire wirschip to ma; Þan [com] þe fende þat es oure fa, And in ?owre moder fand he stede, And did hir do efter his rede; Sone scho ette, als he hir red, Of þe fruit god vs bath for bed; Scho bed it me and I ette sum, And þus bigan oure care to cum; Þe gerrard þus gan hir bigile, And me also, allas þat while. Þan of oure werk was god il paid, And als sone vnto me he said: ‘Adam, for þou has left my lare And broken þe bode þat I bad are, And mare wroght efter þi wife, Þan efter me þat lent þe life, Vnto þi bodi sal I send Sexty wowndes &amp; ten to lend, Right fra þi heuid vnto þi hele, Eghen and eres and ilka dele; And all þi lims on ilka side Witht sorows sall be ocupide.’” He said: “suns, god has sent þis thing Vntill vs and all oure of spring; Bot oure lord god almighty Said we suld haue oile of mercy, In þe werldes end, if we wald craue, Of all þis site vs forto saue.” All on þis wise when he had talde, He feled sorows ful many falde; He cried and said him self vnto: “Allas, caytif, what sall I do, Þat slike sorows er to me send, And has no medsin me to mend?” When eue herd þat he said swa, Scho wepid and had ful mekell wa, And vnto god fast gan scho call: “Lord, forgif me þir angers all; I wroght þe werk, þat wate I wele, Wharfore we haue þis dole ilk dele.” Scho praied adam on þis manere: “Lord, lat me haue þi sorow sere, ffor sertes I did all þe syn Wharfore þou es þir angers in.” Þan adam answerd hir vntill: “It may noght be wroght at oure will, Oure lord of heuyn þat [has it send Thurgh his might he may it mend.” Adam þan vnto seth gan say: “Sun, of a thing I sal þe pray, fforto wend als I sall þe wys Vnto þe ?ates of paradis, And at þe ?ates, when þou cumes right, Þou sal mak sorow in goddes sight, ffall to erth and powder þe, And pray god haue mercy on me; ffor þan par auenture send sall he Sum of his angels to þat tre, Of whi[l]k springes þe oile of life, Þat medcyn es to man and wife, Þar forto send me sum dele, Þan hope I þat my care sal kele.” Þan answerd seth and said in hy: “To do þi will I am redy, Bot þe bus teche to me the way, And what I sall to þe angell say.” Adam said: “sun, tell him till How þat I haue angers ill, And tell him also of þis thing How þat my life es nere ending; And pray him me to certify Of þe oile of mercy weterly, Þe whilk god hight me of his grace, When he me put out of þat place; If he [now þat sand to me [will send, Of all my sorow it sall me mend. And sun,” he said, “I sall þe say Wharby þou sall ken þe way: Þou sall sone find a grene gate Euyn vnto paradis ?ate; Wend estward &amp; for no thing let, Vntill þou in þat way be set; Þan many fotesteps saltou se, Bath of þi moder and of me; ffor by þat ilk way went we twa, Þi moder and I with outen ma, When we war put out of þat blis To won in midelerth for oure mis; And þe sin of vs twa allane Was so grete and god with gane, Þat in what stedes oure fete gan fall, Þare groued neuer gres, ne neuer sall, Bot euermore be ded and dri, And falow, and fade, for oure foly; Þus saltou find, with outen mis, Right to þe ?ates of paradis.” Seth es went, with sorows sad, ffurth right, als his fader bad, And hastily he fand þe way, Als adam vntill him gan say, With welkit steppes many ane, Als his fader bifore had gane; And euen he held þat ilk gate vntill he come to paradis ?ate. On his face þan fell he downe And kest pouder opon his croune, fful mekill, murnig gan he make And sorowed for his fader sake; And vnto god fast gan he cri Of adam for to haue mercy, And oile of mercy him to send, So þat he might in liking lend. So als he made his praiers fast, god sent saint michael at þe last; He bad [þat seth he suld vp rise And said vnto him on þis wise: “Seth,” he said, “what sekes þou here? I am michaell [goddes messangere; My lord of heuyn has ordand me Ouer all his men keper to be. And sertanly to þe I say, Þat þe thar nowþer grete ne pray Efter þe oile of mercy here, ffor þou gettes it on no manere, Vntill a tyme if þou tak tent When fiue thousand ?ere er went, Twa hundret and twenty þar till, And also aght als es goddes will Þan sal god send doun his sun Crist in to þe werld at won; ffor mannes sins þan sal he dy, And so fra bale he sall þam by, Grauen he sall be in a stede And rise þe thrid day right fra [þe ded, And lif ogayne, in lim and lith; And adam þan sall rise him with; Adam and all his of spring, Þat god vntill his blis will bring; With crist þan sall þai right vp ryght And wende to won in lastand light; Þan sal þi fader right vp rise And wend to welth in paradis, And þat same crist als I tell þe In þe flum sal baptist be; To saue man saules he sall be send And all fals trowth he sall defende; Þe oyle of mercy sal he gif Till all þat in his law will lif; And till all þat will sese of sin Sal he gif blis þat neuer sal blin; Þan sall þi fader cum fra paine And dwell in paradis ogayne. Þarfore if þou þi fader se, Say him als I haue said to þe: His daies er dreuen vnto þe end, Langer in þis life may he noght lend. Bot first now, or þou wend oway, Sall þou do als I þe say; Wende unto paradis ?ate And put in bot þi heuid þarate, And lat þi body stand þaroute, And luke what þou sese þe obout; And if þou any selkuth se, Cum ogayne and tell to me.” Seth went and did on þis manere, And saw ful many selkuthes sere; He herd þare noyse and nobill smell, Swetter þan any tong might tell; Gay herbes and trese þare gan he se, And fowles sang ful grete plente; In middes of paradis saw he right A well þat was schinand ful bright, Of þe whilk foure flodes ran out, And went ouer al þe werld obout; He saw of þa foure flodes clere Come al þe water in þis werld here. Obouen þe well persayued he Whare þare stode a ful faire tre, With branches þaron maniane, Bot bark ne lefe ne had it nane; Þan had seth meruail in his mode Whi þat tre so naked stode; And wele he hopid, his hert with in, Þat it was for his fader sin, Als þe steppes war þat he had sene, Þat neuer bare none herbes grene, And all for þe sin of þam twa, þarfor he trowed þe tre was swa. Al þis thoght when he had left, In ogaine þan luked he eft, And hastily þan gan he se A meruaile of þe mekill tre. Him thoght þat it stode vp ful euyn And rechid on heght right to þe heuyn, And bark inogh þar on was sene With leues þat was gay and grene; And in þe crop of þat tre on hight A litill childe he saw full right, Lapped all in clathes clene, Als it right þan born had bene, So till his sight it semed ?ing, He had grete meruaile of þis thing; Vnto þe erth þan luked he And saw þe rotes of þat same tre, Weterly him thoght þai fell In to þe vtterest end of hell, And þare him thoght he had a sight Of his broþer saul ful right, Abell þat was sakles slaine. Þan to þe angell he went ogayne And tald vnto him albidene, Als he þare had herd &amp; sene. He pried þe angell tell him mare Of þe childe þat he saw þare. Þe angell answerd him in hy And said what it suld signify: “Þe childe þat þou saw in þe tre, And hame also with him he had Þe kirnels als þe angell bad. De obitu primi parentis ade When seth had wroght all on þis wise And cumen hame fra paradise, Vntill his fader fast gan he fare, Als he lay in sekenes sare, And tald vnto him albidene How he had done, whare he had bene, And how þe angell gan him hete Þat he suld haue his bale to bete, Oile of mercy fra god send To saue him in þe werldes end. When adam herd him sogat say, Þa wordes ful gretely gan him pay, And in his life þan anes he logh, ffor he hopid forto win fra wogh, And forto be saued sertainely. Þarfore to god þus gan he cry: “Lord, me list no langer lif, Mi gaste in to þi hend I gif fforto wis it at þi will, In whilk stede so it sall go till.” Þus he died with in [þe thrid day Als þe angell vnto seth gan say; Þan had he lifed in þis werld here Nien hundreth and threty ?ere; ffor mans kinde was þan so strang, Þat þai moght wele lif so lang. When he was ded þus als I tell, Both wife and barnes opon him fell And lay opon þe cors criand, Heuid to heuid and hand to hand, Þai trowed to turn life him vntill, ffor þai kowth þan none oþer skill; And als þai murned with dreri mode, Michaell come and by þam stode, And oþer angels gudely graid, And vnto seth al þus he said: “Wepes namore, bot bese still, ffor þus it es my lordes will, Þat I sal teche here ?ow vnto How ?e with þis cors sall do; Takes him vp and wendes with me, ffor in erth sall he bereed be.” Þai toke þe cors vp þam omang, And þe angels bifore gan gang Singand all ful solempnely, And makand nobill melody; To þe vale of ebron þai him broght And groue him þare als þam gude thoght. Þan al his barnes a wonderd ware Of þe sight þat þai saw þare; Þe angel said þan to þam in hy, “Of þis thing haues no ferly, ffor als we now do him vnto, So sal ?e with ?owre ded men do; Gers beri þam in erth or stane, ffor all sall di þat lifi has tane.” Seth þan opon þa kirnels thoght, Þat he fra paradis had broght; In his fader mowth he þam did, Als þe angell gan him bid. Of þa kirnels thurgh goddes grace Wex thre wandes in litill space, And of þa wandes grete ferlis fell, Als men may here me efter tell; fful mekill sele was to þam sent, Als men may here wha takes entent. Detribus uirgis in ore ade crescentibus In Adams mouth þir wandes stode, Till tyme of noie efter þe flode, Þat was to wit with outen were, A thowsand sexty and twelue ?ere; And furth ?it groued þai in adam ffra noie till tyme of abraham, ffra abraham ?it stode þai þen Vntill þe cuming of moysen; And nowþer flitted fer no nere And ilkone groued by þam self sere; Ane elne of lenkith þa wandes ware And all þis time wex þai nomare, Bot in a state ay war þai sene And euer grouand in like grene. Lang efter þat tyme þus bifell Þat þe childer of israel Went with moyses thurght þe se ffra pharao and his men?e, Þat mekill wa had to þam wroght, And in grete bondage had þam broght; Þai past þe se bath hale and sound, And pharao and his men war dround. And when þaire fase war þus for done, To þe vale of ebron come þai sone, And als þai in þat dale gan dwell, fforther mar þan þus bifell; Opon ane euyn als moyses ?ode He saw whare þir thre wandes stode, Þat are in adams mowth was sett, And with grete honore he þam grett. “ffor suth,” he said, “þir wandes mene Þe trinite þam thre bitwene, Þat on þis wise er samin sett, ffor in þe rote all war þai mett.” Þa wandes þan thoght he forto take Wirschip to þam forto make; And fra þe erth when he drogh þam out So nobil smell was þam obout, And so gude sauore gan þai fele, Þat his men wend wonder wele Þat þai had bene cumen right, To þe land of hest þat þam was hight; Al his folk þai war ful fayne And loued god with might &amp; mayne. Moyses toke þa wandes schene, And lapped þam in clathes clene, And als a relik obout þam bare, With wirschip als þai worthy ware: Ay whils þai dwelled so in fere, And þat was foure &amp; fourty ?ere, And all þat war with wormes smeten Or els with wilde bestes beten, And þai might neght þa wandes nere Þai suld als fast be hale and fere So þat defaut suld þai find nane, Thurgh towcheing of þe wandes allane. So it bifell þe folk had care ffor þat þam wanted water þare, And in þaire hertes þai bigan To be mis trowand ilka man, To god þai groched al bidene; And moyses said to þam in tene: “Mistrowand men, herkins to me, If ?e in trowth will stedefast be, We sall gett water grete wane Here out of þis hard stane.” ffor god had bidden him on þis wise Þat he suld strike on þe flint twise, And largely þan suld it gif Water þat þai with might lif; Þan with his wand þe stane strake he And water went out grete plente, Þat men and bestes had þaire fill Of water at þaire awin will. And for moyses toke all þe mede And loued noght god for his gude dede, Ne gert þe folk na louing make To him þat sent it for þaire sake, Þarfore oure lord god all mighty Said vnto moyses opinly, Þat he suld noght þa childer bring Vnto þe land of his heteing, Þat was þe land of promisiowne, Þat he had made vnto þam boune. Þan moyses wist and wele he kend Þat his life drogh nere þe ende; To þe hill of thabor þan went he And þare he sett þir wandes thre, [By side a water vnder þat hill, ffor he hopid it was goddes will Þat gude werk suld with þam be done; Þan efter þis he died sune. Quomodo david tulit uirgas in Ierusalem Still þan stode þa wandes þare A thowsand ?ere, &amp; wex nomare, Bot in a state ay gan þai stand Till dauid was king of Iews land; And þat was a lang tyme bitwene, And euer þai groued ilyke grene. Þan dauid was thurgh þe haly gaste Warned þat he suld wende in haste, In to þe land of araby Till þe hill of thabor hastily, Þe thre wandes þare forth fett, Þat moyses þe profett had sett; To ierusalem þat þai war broght, ffor thurgh þam suld be wonders wroght, And diuers dedis done bidene, And efterward so was it sene. Þus when dauid warned was, Till araby sone gan he pas, To þe hill of thabor fast he ?ode, Whare þir ilk thre wandes stode; Vnto þe stede he went full euyn, Als he was warned with god of heuyn; And when he of þe wandes had sight, He honord þam with all his might, And toke þam vp out of grounde; And swilk a smell þare was þat stounde, And noise and nobill melodi Of divers maners of minstralsy, Þat dauid and his men?e wend Þe haly gaste had þare descend, So mekill mirth gan with þam mete Of nobill noyse and sauore swete; Þan dauid laid þa wandes in fere In a kase al of siluer clere; He sang ful fast so was he faine, And on þis wise he went ogayne, And als þai went so by þe strete, Seke men many gan þai mete, All war þai helid in gude degre, Thurgh vertu of þa wandes thre. Dauid was ful glad and blith, Vnto his cuntre come he swith; Þe nyend day efter hame come he To ierusalem þe riche cete, Bot night it was thurgh goddes will When þai come þe cete vntill, On þe wandes had dauid thoght With wirschip whare he sett þam moght, And in a dike he did þam right Biside his castell all þat night, And seker men he sett to wake, So þat þai suld no harmes take; On þe morn he thoght to seke a space To plant þa wandes in honest place, fforto be keped honestly, And wirschipd als þai war worthy. To rest he went es noght at laine, And sone at morn he come ogaine; He fand his wandes hale and sownde fful fast grouand on þe grounde, And þar of grete wonder him thoght, Bot remu þam þan wald he noght, ffor in his hert he trowed right Þat þai war sett thurgh godis might; Þar fore he lete þam stand þare still, And bad þat none suld negh þam till; And forto dwell with outen dout He made a stif wall þam obout, Stalwurthly of lime and stane, So þat negh to þam suld nane. Þe same lenkith ?et war þai þare, Als moyses in desert þam bare; Bot þus when dauid sett þam has, Þan wex þai so þat wonder was, Þe body wex in a hale tre And þe crop was branches thre; And for it wex so dauid made A serkell al of siluer brade, And bad þat it suld sawded be All obout þe haly thre; Þat he might wit, with outen were, How mekill it wex ilka ?ere; ffor it wex grete thurgh goddes grace And also lang in litill space; In þat stede þan stode it þare Threty ?ere and sumdele mare, And wex ful fast I vnder stand, ffor þe tyme was nere cumand. Þan dauid wex dreri in mode, ffor in his hert he vnderstode Þat a sinful man had bene And vnt[o] god he gan him mene; Sitand vnder þat haly tre, Grete sorow in his hert had he, And in his sorowing said he þus, “Miserere mei deus” et cetera And so he made his mis to mende Þe sawter buke right to þe ende. And in remission of his syn To mak a kirk he gan bigin, And þare obout he begged fast, Till foure and thwenty ?eres war past; And bisid him both day and night With werkmen þat war wise and wight; And for he was synfull man Of god þus was he warned þan: “A hows to me saltou neuer make, And þat es for þi sinnes sake.” Dauid answerd and said in hy: “Lord, wha sall make þi hows bot I? Wha sall vnto þi werk tak tent, Sen vnto me no sele es sent?” “Salomon þi sun,” said he, “Sall mak a temple vnto me, Þat euer mare sal be in minde, And in meneing omang man kinde.” Þan dauid wist righ[t] wele inogh, Þat his life fast till ende drogh, Of þat cete gert he call Þe eldest men &amp; maisters all; And hastily þai come him till fforto wit what was his will; Þan vnto þam al þus said he: “Takes salomon my sun for me, ffor, sirs, als sune I sal be ded, And god has chosen him in my stede.” His corown so he gaf oway And so he died þat ilk day; Þan in a grafe þai gan him graue, Whare kinges suld þaire beriing haue, With sang and grete solempnite, Als fell to swilk a lord at be. Quomodo salomon perfecit templum Salomon was corond king, And led þe land at his liking; Moste sutile werkmen has he soght And on þe temple fast þai wroght, And endid it of masonry In þe space of ?eres twa &amp; thretty; fforto tell all his fader tyme And efter þe wirking of him. And when it suld till end be brogh[t], Þe wrightes þat þe timber wroght A mekill balk þam bud haue ane, In þat cuntre þai kouth find nane, Þai soght in toun and in cete, And nowre whare might þai find a tre, Þat wald acorde vnto þaire met, Bot þat þat dauid king had sett; It forto take þe king cumand And bad it suld no langer stand. Þan doun þai hewit þat haly tre So þat þaire werk might endid be; Þai caried it vnto þe kirk And ordand werkmen it to wirk; Þe maisters has þaire mesure tane, Þe lenkith threty cubites and ane; Þai polist it and made it plaine Bot all þaire wirking was in vayne; When it was made efter þaire merk, Þai wand it vp vnto þe werk And langer þan þai fand þe tre, By a cubet þan it suld be; Of þat fare þai war vnfaine, And sune þai gat it doun ogayne. Eft þai toke þaire mesures þan, And kuttes it als wele als þai can; “Do wind it vp biliue,” þai bid, Bot al was in waste þat þai did; Þan was it schorter þan þe assise, Thrise wroght þai with it on þis wise; Acorde to þat werk wald it noght, Þar of þam all grete wonder thoght; Þai cald þe king for he suld se How þai had wroght with þat tre, ffor mekill tene was þam bitid, Sen þai war al so crafty kid. When salomon saw it was swa, In to þe temple he gert it ta, And bad þat it suld honowrd be, ffor sum might trowed he in þat tre; Anoþer balk þan haue þai soght, And al þe werk till end þai wroght. Þe haly tre, on þis manere, Lay in þe temple many a ?ere, Twa pilers of þe kirk bitwene, Þe king gert kepe it þare ful clene, And made [þe custom in þat cuntre, And bad þat ilka man suld be In þat stede anes in ilka ?ere, And ilkone on þaire best manere Þat haly tre forto honowre Þat seþin bare oure sauioure. So it bifell opon a ?ere Al þe cuntre, fer and nere, Vnto ierusalem þai went To honore þat tre with gude entent; A woman was þare þam omang Þat in hir hert ay hopid wrang; Scho soght þeder þe sight to se And trowed no vertu in þe tre; Hir thoght it was scorne in hir wit Þat oþer men so honord it; Maximilla was hir name Scho sat þaron hir self to schame, And for scho trowed no might þarin. Hir clathes biliue bigan to brin Als herdes þat had bene right dry, Þan cried scho loud thurgh prophecy, And said: “my lord, mighty ihesu, Haue mercy and on me þou rew.” When þe iews herd hir on ihesu call, Grete tene in hert þan had þai all; Þai said: “scho sklanders oure goddes euyn, ffor a new god we here hir neuyn.” Þai bad þat bald men suld be boune To haue hir tite out of þe toune, And sune with outen oþer rede, Þai staned hir vnto þe ded; Scho was þe first þat suferd schame ffor þe neuenig of ihesu name. It was þaire custum, als men knew, Þat who so neuind þat name ihesu, He suld be staned to ded als sone, And so was with þat woman done. De probatica piscina Ful many when þai saw þis sight Honord þe tre with all þaire might, And þarto made þai more loueing Þan vntill any oþer thing; Þarfore þe iews thoght grete despite, And to þat tre þai went ful tyte, Out of þe toun þai did it draw, ffor men þar in no might suld knaw, ffor þai saw grete worde of it went, And men þarto toke mekill entent And many men honord it mare, Þan goddes þat in þe iewri ware; Þarfore þai ordand þam omang Þat na more worde of it suld gang, Bot for vertu þat was þar in Þai durst it nowþer breke ne brin; In to a dike þai gan it kast, So to be wasted at þe last. Þarfore in þat dike þai it did. Bot god wald noght þe might war hid, Sen þat so grete word of it went, Þarfore his sande þarto he sent; Euer ilka day a sertaine tyme, Bitwix þe vnderon and þe prime His angels to þat haly tre fful oft siþes men might þam se, Þai moued þe water in þat tide And wesche þe tre on ilka side; And all men þat war seke and sare If þai in þat tyme might be þare, When þe water was moued swa, Wha so might first in to it ga, If he had neuer so mekill bale, Hastily he suld be hale Thurgh vertu of þat haly tre; Þis was knawin in ilk cuntre, ffor mani þat blind &amp; croked ware Hastily war þai helid þare. So when þe iews persayued right, Þat thurgh þe tre was schewid slike might, Þai said it suld noght lang be swa; Out of þe water þai gan it ta, And ordand it to be a brig, Ouer a noþer bek to lig, ffor so þai trowed þat mens fete, And bestes þat went by þe strete, Suld cum and ga all ouer þat tre So þat it suld wasted be; ffor grete despite in hert þam thoght Þat wonders thurgh it war wroght. Þus lay þis tre þare, als I tell, Vntill þe sage quene, dame sibell, Come to ierusalem on a ?ere, Wisdom of salomon to here, And by þat side hir gate was graid Whare þis haly tre was laid, And sone when scho þar of had sight Scho honord it with all hir might, kneland doune on aiþer kne, Swilk vertu trowed scho in þe tre; Hir clathes gert scho þar on lig And bare fete went scho ouer þe brig. Thurgh prophecy þan þus scho said: “Þis ilk tre þat here es laid A verray signe wele may it seme Of a domesman þat all sal deme, Als lord and maister moste mighty, Þus may þis signe wele signify.” Scho lended þare ay whils hir list, Grete wit of salomon scho wist; And seþin ogayne gan scho ga To hir cuntre þat scho come fra, And þat tre euer scho gan honowre Þat seþin bare oure sauiowre. Þis haly tre lay in þat stede, Vntill þat crist suld suffe[r] dede, When dome was gifen ordand was he fforto be hanged opon a tre, Þat als a cros þan suld be wroght; On swilk a tre þan had þai thoght, Sone a iew stode vp in hy, And þus he said thurgh prophecy: “Þe kinges tre, I rede, ?e take, Þe whilk ?e laid ouer þe lake, To make a cros both large &amp; lang Þe kyng of iews [þar on to hang.” To þis þai all assented þan, And rathly out of [þe toune þai ran; Þai toke þe tre þan þare it lay, Þe thrid part þai hewed oway, And of þe rembnand haue þai made A large cros, bath lang and brade; Viii cubites þai made it lang With outen þat in þe erth suld gang, And aþer side of cubites thre Þat abouen þe heuid suld be; When it was made þus at þaire will, Þe cete sone þai broght it till, To pilate went þai ful gude spede, He held him wele paid of þaire dede. De fabrice clauorum Þe cros es made, als it sall be, Bot þan þam nedes nayles thre; Þe iews war ful redy boune And ran for nales in to þe toune; Vnto a smith þai come ful sone And bad, “belamy, biliue haue done Make thre nayles stif and gude At naile þe prophet on þe rode.” When þe smith herd þaire entent, How þat ihesu suld be schent, In hert he had ful mekyll wa Obout þe nayles forto ga, ffor of ihesu he vnderstode Þat was prophet trew &amp; gude; Þarfore wele in his hert he thoght Þat for him suld no nayles be wroght; He answerd þam with wordes fre And said: “?e gett none nailes for me, God has sent on me his merke So þat I may wirk no werk.” In his bosum he hid his hand And said he hurt it on a brand, “Þar on,” he said, “I haue slike pine Þat I hope my hand to tyne.” Þan answerd þe iews kene And said vnto him all in tene: “All for noght þou feynes þe, All þi sarenes will we se, And bot we find þi tales trew fful sare it sall þi seluen rew.” Þus thai thret him in þaire saw, And gert him þare his hand out draw, Þan was þare schewed in þat place Grete gudenes thurgh goddes grace; His hand semed als it war sare And hurting had it neuer þe mare; Þe iews saw þat it was so, And namore said þai him vnto. ffurth come þan þe smithes whife, A fell woman and full of strife, By þe iews þare þai stode, Scho spac hir husband litill gude; “Sir,” scho said, and loud gan cry, “Sen when had þou slike malady? ?istereuen, when þe day was gane, Euill on þi handes had þou nane, And sen sekenes es sent to þe Þir men sall noght vnserued be, Þai sall haue nayles or þai ga, Als sone my self sall þam ma.” Scho blew þe belise ferly fast, And made þe yren hate at þe last. Þe iews helppid hir forto smite, So þat thre nayles war made ful tite; Hir husband saw and stode ful still, He durst noght say þat scho did ill; Þai war full grete and rudely wroght, Bot þarfore þai forsuke þam noght, Bot sone, when þai þir nailes had, ffurth þai went with hert ful glad, And hastily þai toke þe gate Vntill þai come to sir pilate. And in þis while þe iews kene Sat and carped þam bitwene On what maner best þai moght Help þat crist to dede war broght; And sone assigned sertain stede Whare he suld be done to dede. When þai war all redy boune fforto trus with him of toune, Þan þai strafe als þai war wode Whilk of þam suld bere þe rode; And sum said: “bere it sal he Þat þar on suld hanged be.” Þan þe maisters all on raw Assented sone vnto þat saw. Þai gert ihesus þan bere þe rode, And so he did with milde mode. Þai led him thurgh þat cete, No mercy wald þai on him se. Þare folowd him ful mekill rout, [By fore, byhind and all obout; Sum for him wepid ful sare And sum war fain of his misfare. Omang þam led þai theues twa Þat with him vnto ded suld ga, fforto mene on þaire manere Þat he was thefe and theues fere; ffor all despite þat þai might do Thoght þam ouer litell him vnto. Þus out of toune when he was led All for betyn and all for bled, Þan mary his moder dere And oþer þat war to him nere, Þat might noght pas omang þe prese, Anoþer way full sune þai chese By a lane es noght to layne; Þat gate vnto þam was more gayne, Þare þai thoght him forto mete, ffor þai might noght pas by þe strete; And when þai come with owten towne, [ffull drerely þai sett þam doune, With mekyll wa so gan þai wepe, And sat in care crist forto kepe. And when mari so meke &amp; milde Saw ihesu hir awyn childe So toiled and tugged omang þe men, ffor care scho kowth noght wele him ken, So was he rugged raced and reuyn And seþin with dust all was ouer dreuyn, He stowped vnder þe heuy tre Þat mekill sorow was to se; And when mary his moder dere Saw hir sun on þis manere, Doune scho fell vnto þe grownde And for sorow oft siþes scho swonde Till scho might noght cum for thrang. And vntill hir he loked lang, His manhed sighed for hir sake, ffor muring þat he saw hir make. Wemen foloud maniane Þat murned and made mekill mane, ffor ihesu sake þai wepid sare, Vnto him might þai do nomare; When ihesu saw þaire simple chere, He said to þam on þis manere: ffilie ierusalem nolite timere “?e doghters of ierusalem And wiues out of bedleem, Nomore now ?e murn for me, ffor no sorow ?e on me se; Bot for ?owre self wepe ?e þis day And for ?owre childer murn ?e may; ffor þe daies er cumand fast Þat all ioy sall be fra ?ow past; Opon ?owre faders sal ?e cry And on ?owre moders and say in hy: ‘ffaders, wharto war we born? Wikked werdes er vs byforn; Moders, wharto war we wroght? Bette[r] war vs haue bene noght.’ Vnto þe hillis þan sall ?e say, And vnto mountaynes in þe way: ‘Hilles, falles doune on vs in fere And mowntaynes on þe same manere, Doun opon vs fast ?e fall Out of þis care to couer vs all.’ And þus þan sall ?e say sertayne: ‘Blisced be þe bodis þat er barayne, Þat in þis werld neuer childer bare.’ Vnto ?ow sall cum þis care, And so it may ?it fall and be Þat more meruailes sall ?e se.” Þe iews þat war fers and fell Droght him furth and wald noght dwell, Sir pilate went with mekill rout And oþer maisters þat obout. And so als þai went by þe strete, Ane vncouth man þare gan þai mete, Symon he hight, þe suth to say, vnto þat cete was his way ffor erandis þat he had to do When he come þe cete vnto; Þe iews saw by ihesu state Þat he was wery of his gate ffor bereing of þe hewy tre, And of him had þai no pete, Bot so forto spede þaire iornay Vnto symon gan þai say: “Maister,” þai said, “þou es wele mett And wele [þou has þi trauail sett; A man es here omanges vs led Þat wery es and all for bled, Him self beres þe same tre Þat he on sall hanged be, And þis grete birþin þat he beres To gang with all mekill him deres; And if þou will now for oure sake Of þis man þe rode tre take And bere it furth whare it suld be, Mekill wald we thank þe.” Symon answerd and said: “nay, I may noght bere it by þis day, And hasty thinges I haue to do So þat I may noght tent þarto.” Þan þe iews answerd in tene And said vnto him [all by dene: “ffor sakes þou to bere þe tre When þat we haue bidden þe? Tak it vp and tari noght Or ful dere it sall be boght.” Symon saw it was no bote Ogaynes so many forto mote, Till him he toke þe tre onane And bare it on his schulder bane; Þai gert him bere it with maistri Vnto þe mownt of kaluery; And þare on lang þai laid it doun, And hastily þai made þam boun Þaire wikked thoght forto fulfill. Þan ihesu [full tyte went þai till, His clathes fra him sone þai tugged And all his hide in sunder rugged; And lotes opon his clathes þai kest, Wha suld haue whilk, so thoght þam best; Sum said: “we sall his [clothe chere, Ilk man his part oway to bere.” Sum said: “we sall noght kerue his kote, Bot luke wha sall it haue by lote.” Non cindamus eam sed sorciamur cuius sit Þus of his clathes þai wrogh þaire wyll And scorned him withowten skilk. Þai hasted þan als þai war wode Þat he war hanged on þe rode, And how þat he on rode was done Now sall I say and þat ful sune; Þai toke ihesu þat naked stode And layd him doun opon þe rode, Both his armis þai laid on brade Till bores þat þai [by fore had made, And furth also þai laid his fete; Bot to þaire merkes was he noght mete, Þe bores war bored so fer fro His armes might noght reche þam to, If þe tone hand at þe bore ware, Þat oþer failed a fute and mare, And his fete failed fer of þe bore, So wide þan war þai made bifore. Þe iews, when þai persayued þis thing, In þaire hertes had grete hething, Euil thoght þam oþer bores to make, Þarfore grete rapes gan þai take, Þai did a rape at aiþer hand, Þe blude brast out at þe band; On aiþer side þan gan þai draw Vntill þai might þe bores knaw; Þe sins brast, þat was no wonder, And lith fro lith all rafe in sunder, Sunder went both sins and vaine, To fele þat was a ferly paine; Twa grete nayles þai toke þat tide And thurgh his handes þai gert þam glide. Þan for þe paynes he feled so sare His vaines and sins so schronken ware Þat his fete war þan fra þe bore fferrer þan þai war [by fore; Þai toke a rape þat wald wele last And fest obout his fete ful fast; Þan all at anes on him þai droght, Þai wald noght wand to wirk him wogh, Þat sunder went both fless and skyn And noght held bot allane þe scyn; Bot þai wald noght fine þarfore Vntill his fete passed þe bore ffully þe space of a span; A grete naile tite toke þai þan, When he with þe bore was mete, And draue it thurght out both his fete; Þe blude brast out both bla and rede, Wers was neuer none done to dede. On þis wise when þai had done, Þe rode tre þai raised sone And sett it hight vp on þe hill, ffor no man suld touche þartill; And for þe fute þai made a pit, ffor no man suld it þeþin flit, And when þe pit was made wele depe, Ilkone toke till oþer kepe, And vp þai lifted þe cros all And seþin fast þai tele it fall Into þe pit to eke his paynes, Þat sunder rafe both sins &amp; vaynes; And þai schogged it till and fra On all manere to wirk him wa; When it was sett so doune at anes, Þai pinned it fast with mekill stanes. Þe twa theues þan toke þai tite, Þat with him war broght for despite, And hanged him on aiþer syde. And þan þai fell on knese &amp; cried: Vath qui destruit templum dei “Lo, þus said þis thefe feloune, Oure mekill temple he might cast doune, And als he said with in thre days Right ogayne he might it rayse; Goddes sun if þat he be, Lat him come doune now fra þis tre, And if he may so help him now, All we will opon him trow.” And als þai bere witnes þat wate Sir pilate þan a letter wrate, With his awyn hand ilka worde, And fested it on a playne borde And sett it on þe rode tre So þat ilkaman might se; Grew ebrew and latyne Was wretyn in þe parchemyne, And on þis wise it was to mene: “Þis es ihesus nazarene, Þat king es of ilka iew.” Þus was it wreten als men knew; Nazarene was grew &amp; ihesus ebrew And king of iews was latyn trew. Thesus nazarenus rex iudeorum All þe iews þat it cowth rede [Ware euill paid of þat ilk dede, And to sir pilate gan þai cri: “Sir, þou dose a grete foly, Write noght þat he es iews king, ffor hely þat es a lesyng, He cald him self þe king of iews, Þat saying now we hope him rews; All if he [him self so cald, None oþer men so sall him hald.” Sir pilate said: “so mot I the, Als it es wreten, so sall it be; I cumand ?ow ?e let it stande, Þat no man negh it nere with hand.” Þan of þe theues þat hang him by, Þe tone of þam bigan to cry And þus he said vnto ihesus: “Lord, þou saue þi self and vs, Sen we er all samin in þis stede, Saue vs þat we be noght dede.” Þe toþer blamed him for his saw And said: “oure self [may clerely knaw Þat we bath er wele worthy ffor oure dedis here forto dy, And for oure werkes withowten drede Hider er we broght to haue oure mede; And þis man þat es hider broght In word ne werk he trispast noght, Trayturly þai haue him tane And sakles [here he sall be slane, If he wald wele might he fle, Bot his will es ded forto be, Sen he will noght him seluen saue, How suld we of him helping haue?” When he had said on þis manere, To ihesu made he his prayere: “Lord,” he said, “I pray to þe A bone þat þou wald grant to me: When þou cums in to þi blis, Þou think on me and mend [my mys, And help, lord, þat I [migh come With þe to won in þi kingdome.” Þan ihesus oure lord so dere Said to þe thefe on þis manere: Amen dico tibi; hodie mecum eris in paradiso “Þis day,” he said, “I hete þe þis, To be with me in paradis.” Þus þe thefe þat trowed right Went to welth þat ilk night, And he þat in mistrowing was Hastily to payne gan pas. By þan was mari his moder gude Cumen right vnder þe rode, And when scho saw hir sun so hang, Doun scho fell in sorow strang, Bot saint iohn, cristes cosyn dere, He was euermore by hir nere And oþer maries þam omell Confort hir fast ay when scho fell; Thre maries þan war þare Þat for crist had mekill kare, Ane was mari his moder clene, Anoþer mari magdalene, And also mari cleophe, And saint iohn was ay with þam thre. Ihesus luked sane onone Vntill his moder and saint iohn, And sune he sayd with simple chere Vnto his moder on þis manere: “Woman, in þe stede of me Bihald to iohn, þi sun es he.” And to iohn said he tiþinges new: “Man, bihald þi moder trew, Þou be hir sun when I am dede And scho þi moder in ilka stede.” When mari herd þis doleful tale, In hert scho had ful mekill bale, And so with [syte scho vmset Þat water and blude both scho gret; Saint iohn þan, als sais þe boke, Mary vntill his moder toke, fful mekill luf was þam bitwene, ffor þai war both maidyns ful clene. Þan spak ihesus ful mildely Vnto þe puple þat past him by: “?e folk þat passes by þe strete, Lukes vp and se my wondes wete And whatkin turmentes I here take, And suffers sorows for ?owre sake; Bihaldes if any oþer pine May be likkind vnto myne, Or if any oþer thing Sufferd euer so hard pineing.” [Also I say, þar was neuer nane With so mekill sorows slane; Haly writ sais it was slike, Þat no payne may be to it like, All oþer payn es bot a play Till dole þat he sufferd þat day. On þis wise als he hanged þare, He said to þam: “me thristes sare.” And when þai herd him say so þan, Hastily ane of þam ran And fild a spounge &amp; broght it þeder With aysell and with gall togeder, Þai set it vp opon a rede And till his mowth þai gan it bede; “Drink,” þai said, “for no thing spare, Efter þis þou sall haue mare.” Ihesus wist how þai had wroght, Of þat drink þan wald he noght; His meneing was no drink to taste, Bot to help man saul had he haste; Þarfore he said with wordes hende: “Þis dede es done and broght till ende.” Obout þe midday was it þan, Als þir clerkes declare it can, Þe sun bemes ful bright schane, Bot hastily it was ouer gane, Mirk it was with owten light, Þe day semed als it war night; And þat tyme, als god vowched safe, Þe vaile in þe temple rafe, Þe stanes brak in diuers stede, And bodis rase þat are war dede And went obout on sides sere, Þat was grete wonder forto here, Men might þam se and with þam speke, And all þis was in signe of wreke; Þe erth trembled and al to schoke, And halows in heuyn for ferdnes quoke; And all ?it war þir dedes done Bytwix þe vnderon and none. Þan ihesu so mild and gude, Als he hang opon þe rode, Loud he cried, “Ely, Ely;” And als, “lamazabathany;” Þat es to mene on þis manere In oure tong, als ?e sall here: “My lord, my god, my fader fre, Whi hastou forsaken me?” Þe iews þan þat stode biside Herd how þat he Ely cryde; Þai wend þat he had cald ely, Þat was a man of þaire iewry; Þarfore þai war all euil paid And ilkone þus till oþer sayd: “Sen he has efter Ely cald, Lat vs stand still and bihald, ffor if he cum to tak him doune With sorow sall he cum to toune; He cals him for sum sertan scill, Lat se what he will do þar till.” Þan said ihesus with wordes still: “ffader, I haue wroght þi will, Done I haue efter þi rede, Sakles here I suffer dede; Bot, fader, forgif þam þaire gilt, Þat sakles here my blode has spilt. ffor whi þai wate noght what þai do, Þarfore þai tak no tent þarto, ffor gif þam if þi willes be Þe dedes þai haue done to me.” Þan his heuid on his schulder he laid And þus vnto him self he said: “ffox has den and fowles has nest Whare in þai may tak þaire rest, And I, þat am goddes sun so dere Obouen all bestes &amp; fowles in fere, Place [vnto me es nane leuid Whar on I may rest my heuid, Bot anly on my schulder bane, Oþer esment haue I nane.” Þan spac he till his fader dere And said to him on þis manere: “ffader mine, þat all may mend, I gif my gaste in to þi hend.” Þan lowted he doune his heuid still And ?ald þe gaste als was his will. Centurio þan stode biside And tuke ful gude tent in þat tide How þat crist had gifen þe gaste And on þis wise he said in haste, Vere filius dei erat iste “Suthly,” he sais, “with owten mis “Werray god sun of heuyn was þis, By signes þat he er sene on raw, Þat he was god sum may we knaw.” When crist was ded þus als I tell, His godhed hastily went to hell, And sune he brac þe ?ates strang, Ogaines him war þai sperd with wrang; Þe fendes war so sare adred, If þai might, þai wald haue fled, Bot ferrer may þai neuer fle, Þaire heritage es þare to be; Satanas he fested fast With bandes þat sall euer last, And so he sall be bunden ay Vntill þat it be domes day; With him he toke adam &amp; eue And oþer þat war to him leue, Iohn þe baptist, moyses alswa, Abraham, and oþer ma, Þat he had boght with paines fell, All he led þam out of hell And put þam in to paradis, Whare ioy es euer and endles blis, And gaf þam ioy for euer mare In þe welth whare þai war are. Þus þat tre þat gan vs greue Thurgh þe first mysdede of Eue, Of þat same oure bote bygan Now when it bare bath god &amp; Herd ?e haue how þe rode tre Was cumen first of kirnels thre, And of þat ilk tre war þai tane ffor whilk man saul with sin was slane, And seþin it bare oure sauiowre, Vnto wham be euer honowre. Þus whils þe saul vnto hell ?ode, Þe body hinged opon þe rode; Centurio, als I said are, To speke him gude walde he noght spare, He said of crist ay als he knew, Þat he was prophet gude and trew. Þe iews had þarat despite, Vnto presun þai toke him tyte, In hard paynes þai him ponist, ffor þat he carped gude of crist. Þus when þai war hinged swa, Ihesus and þe theues twa, Heghest of þam hinged was he, So þat all men suld him se. When þai had made all þaire hething, Hame þai went and lete him hing. [I]oseph peciit corpus ihesu Mari his moder with drery mode Dwellid euer vnder þe rode, And oþer þat war with hir in fere, Sorowand euer with simple chere; Þe trowth þan left in hir anely Þat cristen saules er saued by, ffor þat he suld rise trowed nane When he was ded bot scho allane, Scho trowed it euer in hert &amp; will Als he bifore had tald hir till; And had scho noght bene trew thoght, With dole scho had to ded bene broght. So efter help þare gan þai hone Vntill it was efter þe none; Þan come þare vnto þat cete A riche man of golod and fe Þat lord was of aramathy And in þat cuntre had maistri, Ioseph was þat mans name, fful mighty was he haldem at hame, Ihesu lufed he wonder wele ffor fait þat he in him gan fele; And hastily when he herd tell Of all þir ferlis how þai fell, And how ihesu was done to dede Wran[g]wisly with wikked rede, Vnto him might he do nomare Bot þat þe body biried ware; And þarfore fast he toke þe gate Vnto he come to sir pilate. “Sir,” he said, “now pray I þe, Ihesu body grante þou me; Suffer me to tak it doune And bere it sone vnto sum toune.” Þan pilate asked sir cayphas And anna what þaire consail was; Þai said: “sir, ?e sall vnderstand Oure sabot day es nere cumand, And hingand sall na bodise be In tyme of þis solempnite; Þarfore we rede ?e gif þam leue To tak him [doune it noght greue.” Þus þai all assented ware, Þan pilate said to ioseph þare: “Ihesu body grant I þe, Bot I will wit þat he ded be.” Knightes cald he him vnto, And bad þai suld with ioseph go Vnto þe mount of caluery To wit þe soth all weterly, If he þat hanged in þat stede, Þe fals prophet, war fully ded; “And if he be ded on þat hill, Lat ioseph wirk with him his will.” Þe knightes went with ioseph þan And so did mani ane oþer man, And when þai come to caluery, Þare fand þai oþer bydand him by, His moder murnand with dreri chere And oþer of his frendes in fere. Vnt[o] þe theues first come þai; If þai war ded forto assay, Sum with staues and sum with stanes Sunder brac þai þaire the banes. Þan had mary mekill wo Þat þai suld do with ihesu so; Bot when þai come vnto ihesu, By his countenance wele þai k[n]ew þat he was ded with outen drede, To brek his banes it was no nede. Bot þare omang þam was a knight, Longeus for suth he heght, And if he war stif and strang, Blind he was and had bene lang; Vnder þe cros þai gert him stand, And gaf him a scharp spere in hand, Þe poynt þai set to ihesu side, And bad him put fra him þat tide; Þe knight, þat wist neuer what he wroght, Putted fast and spared noght, Þe scharp spere sune glide he gert Vnder þe pap to ihesu hert, Both water &amp; blude biliue out ran; Of þat ilk bale oure bute bigan, Þe water wesche all oure wa oway, Þe blude vs boght to blis for ay. Bot mari, when scho saw þat sight, ffor sorow lost both maine and might, Doune vnto þe erth scho drafe, Both hide and hare for rewth scho rafe, Bot iohn hir cosin mild of mowth, Comfort hir all þat he cowth; Þus all his frendes in bale ware braste, Bot hir muring was euer maste. Als longeus stode, þat nobil man, Þe blude vntill his fingers ran, Þan till his eghen he towched right, And hastily so he had his sight; And when he wist how he had wroght, In his hert sare him for thoght, He hopid ihesus suld tak vengance sone ffor þe dede þat he had done; Þarfore on knese doune gan he fall, And to crist gan he mercy call, And loued god of all his grace Þat so was puplist in þat place. Þe body þai toke ioseph vntill And bad him wirk þar with his will. De cruce deponitur hora vespertina Ioseph þan gat help ful gude And toke cors doun of þe rode, Þe nailes out of his hend þai drogh And fra his fete with mekill wogh; þai clensed þan his wondes wete And dried þe holes in hend and fete; Þai toke þe cors þan þam bitwene And lapped it in clathes clene, Obout þai band a sudary, Als custum was in þe iury; Þan in a graue þe cors þai laid Þat ioseph had þarfore puruaid; Coruen was it in a stane, Þar in [by fore had liggen nane. Þan mari his moder was ful fayne, ffor scho hopid he suld rise ogayne, And in þat trowth was oþer nane Stedfastly bot scho allane. Nichodeme was a man gude, He helpid ioseph with mild mode, And with him broght he spicery To strew in þe graue whare crist suld ly, And with ane vnement nobill of force Enoynted he all cristes cors, So þat þe cors might lig still And þat no worme suld touche þartill; And when it was dight albidene, Þai lapped it in sendell clene Þat ioseph had him seluen boght And þeder with him he had it broght, And so þai laid him in þe graue, Þai hopid wele þaire mede to haue; A heuy stane [þai toke in hy And couerd þe graue ful kunandly, Þai made it both ful fast and fit, ffor no man suld it þeþin flit, When it was made [all to þaire pay, Þai lete it be and went þaire way. Sune on þe morn þe iews kene Toke a kounsail þam [by twene, ffor it was tald in þaire presens How ihesus was grauen with grete reu[er]ence, And þarfore had þai grete enuy Vnto ioseph of aramathy; Þai gert seke him in þat sesoune, And sone þai set him in presoune, And said no siluer suld him saue, ffor he had so laid crist in graue; Þe presoun was all wroght of stane And light of windows was þare nane Ne dores on þe hows was none Bot ane whare at he in was done, And þat þai spered with lokkes grete, ffor no man suld him þeþin gete; And seþin þaire seles þai set also Þat no sustenance suld cum him to. And when þai had þir dedes done, Vnto sir pilate went þai sone, Alsamyn for a sertain scill And on þis wise þai tald him till: Seductor ille dixit &amp; cetera “Sir,” þai said, “we vnderstand, Þis lurdan whils he was lifand Said whare he went by ilka way Þat [he] suld rise on þe thrid day, So tald he his desciples all Of ferlise þat suld efter fall; He said: ‘luke þat ?e trow ilkane, When þe iews here has me slane, Thurgh my might wele I may Rise fra ded on þe thrid day.’ And þarfore, sir, now rede we all Þat ?e ?owre knightes byfor ?ow call And ger þam wake þe graue stane Till thre dayes be cumen and gane; ffor his desciples will be bowne Vs to wait ay with tresoune, Þe body ful faine wald þai stele Oway fra vs it forto fele; And if þai ordain men of might To stele þe body oway by night And bere it þeþin out of þe graue Whider so þai will it haue, On ilka side þan will þai say Þat he es resin and went his way, And þan þe folk sall trow ful right Þat he es resin thurgh his awin might; And so, sir, war þe latter dede Wele more þan þe first to drede.” Sir pilate said: “þat wald noght seme; ?e haue ?ape men him forto ?eme, Ordans ?e omang ?ow þan To kepe him als wele als ?e can, O payn of lif þat ?e noght let, And all ?owre gudes to be forfet.” Þan þai ordand knightes foure, Þe wightes[t] men þat þai wist oure, And þai gert arme þam ful wele In armurs of gude iren and stele, And to þe graue þai gert þam wende At ?eme it till þe thrid daies ende. And when þai þusgat charged ware, ffurth þai went with outen mare; When þai come þare, with wordes wise Ilkaman said his a vise; Ane of þam said: “herkins to me, Bisy now bihoues vs be And wisely rede I þat we wit On ilka side how we sall sit; Ane of vs at þe heuid sal wake, An noþer to þe fete tent sal take, And ane [sal sitt at aiþer side, To tent what auenture will bitide; If þai cum hider euer ilkane Þat wont war with him to gane, Hardyly, I haue no dowt, Ane of vs suld ding all þat rowt; And if þai bring with þam in fere A hundreth men whils we er here, Hastily sall þai heuided be Omang vs foure, bot if þai fle.” Þus þai bosted in þaire sow And ilkone gan his swerd out draw; When þai had waked al þat night Manaceand with all þaire might, Ogaynis þe day þai fel on slepe, No power had þai þam to kepe. And ihesus als he said biforn Rase on þe thrid day at morn, Langer he wald noght þare habide, Þe oue[r] stane he put biside; Þe knightes wele of him had sight, Bot forto moue had þai no might. He toke þe way to galile, Þare his desciples might him se; And als he went þe way bitwene, He met with mari magdalene, And to hir said he: “wend þou sall Vnto my desciples all, And say þam I am resen vp right, Als I [be fore vnto þam hight; And warn [mari my moder dere And als saint iohn þat es hir fere, Peter, [and andrew, and oþer ma, And bid þam smertly þat þai ga In to þe land of galile, ffor þare suthly þai sal me se.” Þe woman þan was wonder glad And did biliue als he hir bad; Vntill his mode[r] scho went in hy, And his desciples þat war sary, Scho comforth þam wele in þat stede And how crist was resen fra dede: “Mi lord,” scho said, “and ?owres in fere Es resen I wate with owten were. I saw my self his wondes wete And him quik walkand on his fete; He bad ?ow wende to galile, ffor þare he said ?e suld him se.” And sune when þai þis vnderstode, ffull mekill mirth was in þaire mode; To galile fast gan þai gang, fful mekill mirth was þam omang And with mekill ioy þai ferd ffor þir tiþinges þai had herd, Seþin war þai comfort wele in fere, Als men efter ward may here Of al þe ferlis als þai fell. Bot of þe knightes now will I tell Þat had ihesu in þaire kepeing; Þai slepid vnto þe mornyng, When crist was resin &amp; þeþin gane, Þan þai wakend euer ilkane And in þaire hertes þai dred sum dele, Bot ?it þai wend all had bene wele; Bot when þai toke entent þat tide And saw þe stane was put bisyde, And when þai luked in to þe graue, He was noght þare þat þai suld haue, Al was tome and he was gane Þan þai war ful will of wane; Noght bot þe clathes fand þai þare Þat obout him wonden ware, ffild þai war of dole bidene And ilkone gan till oþer mene. Sune þai saw ane angell bright, Descendand down fra heuyn lyght And rested on þe graue stane Omang þam, als þai made þaire mane, In whit clething all was he cled; Þan þe knightes war ful adred, Þai might noght stand þare in þat stede Bot doun þai fell als þai war dede. And so when þai had liggen lang With mekill muring þam omang, Ane of þam rase at þe last And cald opon his felows fast: “Rises vp, felows,” sone he said, “We haue made a ful [sary brayd, Allas what ailed vs forto slepe, Þat we might noght þarfra vs kepe? Ihesus es resin and gane his gate, What sall we say to sir pilate?” Anoþer said: “allas for wa, What ailed vs to slepe swa? Ban we may þat we war born, [Al oure landes now haue we lorn, And also haue lorn oure liues And heritage fro childer &amp; wiues.” Anoþer said: “what es ?owre rede? Þare es no bute bot we be dede. Mercy thar vs neuer craue, ffor we hope nane forto haue.” Anoþer said: “so mot I the, Þar es no better bute bot fle, ffor if we bide &amp; þis be knawin; Hastily [we be hanged and drawen And þarfore go we heþin oure gate Or tiþandes cum to sir pilate.” Þan spak a knight of nobill will: “ffelows, stintes and haldes ?ow still; Þis dede we will noght hide ne hele, ffor here come no man him to stele, So sal we to sir pilate say.” Sum oþer answerd and sayd: “nay.” On þis manere þe knightes striues, fful ferd þai war to lose þaire liues; Bot on þis wise als þai stude þare Meneand of þis ferly fare, Gude herting hastily had þai, And how it was here sal I say. De liberacione ioseph a carcere When þaire sabot day was done Þe iews assembled all ful sune, ffor ioseph of aramathy, To luke what dede þat he suld dy; In þaire preson done he was, And all þai said he suld noght pas, Bot hanged be with owten hone ffor þe dede þat he had done, ffor he laid ihesus in his graue, þai said no thing his life suld saue: “He sall be laid fer on þe felde Þare wilde bestes his banes may welde.” Vnto þe preson tite þai went And said ilkone he suld be schent; Þai opind þe lokes les and mare, Bot ioseph þan fand þai noght þare, Al fand þai still als þai had stoken And nowþer lokkes ne seles broken. Crist when he was resin fra dede Come euyn to þat same stede, And vp he toke þe hows all hale And broght him þeþin with owten bale And set him in his awin cete, Aramathy, whare he suld be. Þe iews wist no thing of þis, Þai war all awonderd I wis, And ilkone gan till oþer say: “How might he euer win heþin oway Þus out of oure awin kepeing? Sertes þis es a selcuth thing And als it es a foule despite Þat he on þis wise suld ga quite.” Omang þam þus was grete debate And how it was no thing þai wate. Þe knightes þan þat wakeand ware, Herd of all þis ferly fare, How ioseph was in presun fast, And how þat he oway was past; fful faine þai war þan of þat fare And hardier þan þai war are, And furth þai went with eger mode Vnto þe iews þare þai stode, Þai said þe suth and noght for soke: “Þe body þat ?e vs bitoke Es resin out of þe monument, And at his will he es furth went; Þe mekill stane þat on him lay, Ane angell putted it oway And þaropon him self he set, All men on liue might him noght let; Þat angell said men suld him se In þe land of galile, We say ?ow men sal se him þare Whik lifand als he was are.” Þan þe iews grete wonder thoght And said: “trayturs, so es it noght, How suld he lif? lurdans ?e ly, With bitter bale þat sall ?e by, If ?e haue laten his postels hane Þe cors oway out of þe graue, fful wele sall ?e haue ?owre mede, Hanged and drawin for ?owre dede.” Þe knightes þan answerd in hy And karpid to all þat cumpany, Þai said: “for suth he rase vp right Anely thurgh his awin might; fful wonder werkes he has ?ow wroght Oft tymes, all if ?e trowed him noght; How suld ?e trow vntill oure saw When ?e wald noght his wonders knaw? We tell ?ow suthly here bi mowth We kepid him als wele als we kowth, And by him self ful wele we wate Resen he es and gan his gate; And als we wate wele ?isterday How ?e kepid ioseph vnder kay And had ?e kaies ilkane to ?ow, ?it es he went and ?e ne wate how; And þarfore, al þis strif to stere, Þis profer we vnto ?ow here, Deliuers ioseph vntill vs And we sall liuer ?ow ihesus.” Þe iews þan thoght grete despite And to þe knightes fast gan þai flite And said: “by him þat au þis day, Lurdans, ?e ly, all þat ?e say; And wit ?e wele it, [þat if we will, We may bring ioseph ?ow vntill, And þarfore ?eld vs ihesus now And we sall ?elde ioseph to ?ow.” Þe knightes said: “we will warand Þat ioseph es in his awind land And also warand will we Þat ihesus gase in galile.” When þe iews herd all þis tale Omang þam bred ful mekil bale. Þai said: “bot if þir wordes fall, Oure folk sal turn to ihesu all, ffor kownsail þat we wend war hid, Now es it in þe cuntre kid; We wend none oþer men had wist On what wise we iosep mist, Now wate þe knightes als wele als we On what maner may þis be, And þe folk here þusgate say, Halely saltay leue oure lay; Þarfore lat ordaine vs omell Þir sawes sone how we may fell.” Sir pilate anna and cayphas, Þat maisters in þe iewry was, Cald þe knightes þam vnto And said: “if ?e wene wele to do, Vntill oure saws assent ?ow sone, And all forgifen þat ?e haue done; And luke ?e say whare so ?e ga Þat þe cors es stollen ?ow fra.” A sum of tresore þan toke þai And to þe knightes þai it pay, And when þai haue þe tresore tane, Þai charged þam bi ane and ane: “Luke þat ?e say vnto al men On þis wise, als we ?ow ken, Þat armed men with mekil might Come vnto þe graue on night, Sudanly als ?e slepeand lay And stale þe cors fra ?ow away; So forto say it es no schame, Þan may ?e be with owten blame; And tresore to ?ow we giff, And help to haue ay whils ?e lif.” Þe knightes granted euer ilka dele And ilk man trowed þaire wordes wele, And aiþer party held þam paid; Þus in þaire trowth þai war bitraid. Now haue ?e here all haly herd How þat þe iews with ihesu ferd, And how he boght ys with his blude With mekil rewth opon þe rode, And how he mended oure faders mis, And broght þam vnto endles blis. He len vs lord here whils we lend, In his wayes so forto wend Þat we may help forto fulfill Þe blis þat he has boght vs till; And all þat with deuocioune Will here þis precius passioune, And als all þa þat will it rede, Haue þai sall vnto þaire mede Cristes blisced benysoune And a hundreth daies of pardowne, Þat was gifen with gude entent Of þe gude pape Innocent fforto haue vnto þaire medes All þat þis lessoun heres or redes. Now Ihesu for þi moder mylde, Als þow wald chese to be hir childe, Þou len vs so to leue oure sin And mend oure mis both more &amp; myn, Þat we may, when we heþin wende, Byde in blis with owten ende.
