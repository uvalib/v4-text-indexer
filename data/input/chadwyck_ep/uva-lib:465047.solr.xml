      <field name="fulltext">CHORUS. [The Sun's mounting high, we no longer can stay] Curtis and two Girls. The Sun's mounting high, we no longer can stay, Then chearfully work away, Lasses. Curtis. Take Comfort, what tho' he be gone far away, Girl, 'tis but a Folly To be melancholy. Polly. Alas! did you know in my Bosom what passes! Curtis. I know well enough, Child, for I've had my Day. Fishermen. Yo, yeaâLand the Yawl, Pull awayâBy the Weight, We have caught a good Freight: Zounds, Boys, what a Hawl. Two Girls and Curtis. Born humble and chearful, good Humour and Health Are Treasures to us beyond Power and Wealth. Polly. With a Prospect so charmingâ Curtis. Hark, hark, hark, hark! Only hear the Wood Lark, How it makes the Air ring! And the Black Birds, but listen, how sweetly they sing! Chorus. Come, the Tide ebbs apace, Then each Man to his Place: This favouring Breeze While we can let us seize; And while the Birds carol so sweetly around, And the Rocks and the Shore in loud Echo's resound, We'ell be grateful to Heav'n for the Good it has sent, And sing with good Humour, and toil with Content. AIR. [I have not the Grace, and I know not the Art] I have not the Grace, and I know not the Art, In fine Words my poor Mind to array; But express ev'ry Thought as it flows from my Heart, And as Nature shall point out the Way. Yet, yet will I write, and am sure to prevail, While to save my poor Father I try; In the Language of Nature I'll dress a plain Tale, And Duty the rest shall supply. AIR. [Here each Morn, and ev'ry Eve] Here each Morn, and ev'ry Eve, In dewy Ray returning; Shall share the Sorrows that I breathe, Shall witness to my Mourning: Echo, catch the plaintive Lay, To her Heart discover, How, for her, forlorn I stray, How well, how true I love her. If forbidden to renew The Vows which once we plighted; My Lydia's Fate I will pursue, In Death, at least, united: The latest Breath that warms this Clay, At parting, shall discover; How I sigh my Soul away, How well, how true I love her. AIR. [Blow high, blow low, let Tempest tear] I Blow high, blow low, let Tempest tear The Main-mast by the Board, My Heart with Thoughts of thee, my dear, And Love well stor'd, Shall brave all Danger, scorn all Fear, The roaring Wind, the raging Sea, In hopes on Shore, to be once more Safe moor'd with thee. II Aloft, while Mountains high we go, The whistling Winds that scud along, And the Surge roaring from below, Shall my Signal be To think of thee, And this shall be my Song: Blow high, &amp;c. III And on that Night, when all the Crew, The Mem'ry of their former Lives, Our flowing Cans of Flip renew, And drink their Sweethearts and their Wives; I'll heave a Sigh, and think of thee, And as the Ship rowls thro' the Sea The Burthen of my Song shall be, Blow high, &amp;c. CHORUS. [Hail to Sadi Abdallah Chiquaw] Hail to Sadi Abdallah Chiquaw, Of every Village, Port, and Town, City and Province of Renown In fifty Leagues, the Grand Bashaw. Whose Steps a Thousand Slaves attend, Whose Power with Wonder we behold; Whose mighty Treasure's without End, Whose Palace shines with massy Gold. His Sword is like the Morning Ray, His Helmet a Beam of the Sky; Where he comes, he casts round him perpetual Day, And his prostrate Slaves lift their Voices and cry, Hail, &amp;c. AIR. [The little Birds, as well as you] The little Birds, as well as you, I've mark'd with anxious Care, How free their Pleasures they pursue How void of every Care. But Birds of various Kinds you'll meet, Some constant to their Loves: Are chattering Sparrows half so sweet As tender cooing Doves? Birds have their Pride like human Kind, Some on their Note presume, Some on their Form, and some you'll find Proud of a gaudy Plume: Some love a hundred, some you'll meet Still constant to their Loves; Are chattering Sparrows half so sweet As tender cooing Doves? AIR. [If it was not that such a meek Creature as you] If it was not that such a meek Creature as you They'd imagine to have a Concern in't; Before I'd be pent, like a Bird in a Mew, I'd set it on Fire, and burn in't. Why, Child, what d'ye talk, over ev'ry Thing here, I absolute hold a Dominion, And I'll lay you my Life, let to-morrow appear, That you'll own yourself of my Opinion. I command at my Will, ev'ry Slave, ev'ry Mute, His Retinue and all his Regalia, And I'll come and I'll go, Say, Yes, or say, No, Just as Fancy, or Whim, or Caprice it shall suit; Or I'll take ev'ry Key, Set all the Slaves free, And turn out of Doors the Seraglio. AIR. [What shall I do? Oh, la! Oh, la!] What shall I do? Oh, la! Oh, la! I am all over quite one Thaw; I only saw an aged Yew, Thro' which the Wind but whistling blew, And thinking it a horrid Turk, Who swore, he to the Wall would pin me; For fear lest he should fall to Work, I run as is the Dev'l was in me. I am a very drowning Rat. I dread each Breath of Air I hear. I dare not lookâOh, Lord! What's that?â I believe 'twas nothing but my Fear. What Wretch would now be in my Coat? This Frolic dearly we shall rue: I feel the Bow-string at my Throat, What shall I do?âWhat shall I do? Duetto, Quintetto and Chorus. [How beautiful, and how serene] Lydia and Elmira. How beautiful, and how serene, Shines yonder Night's resplendent Queen! Kindly to comfort those who roam, And light the Trav'ller to his Home. Oh, thou, whose Beams so sweetly play, Bestow one kind, one chearing Ray; One sympathetic Gleam impart, To heal the Anguish in my Heart. Reef. These Swabs turn'd in, and fast asleep, Poor Tom, his midnight Watch to keep, Now roams alone, by Love inclin'd To think of her he left behind. Venture, [Behind.] Murder, murder! Oh, dear, dear! Lydia. Hark, Elmira, did you not hear A dreadful Cry of Murder? Elm. Yes. Reef. What means that Signal of Distress? A Sail. [Venture crosses the Stage, Lyd. Elm. I fear the worst. Has. Come on, [Here two Turks cross the Stage. Reef. Two, three. Has. He cannot far be gone. Follow. Lyd. Elm. Alas! Has. This is the Place. I trac'd him by the Light o'th' Moon. Reef. A hoy, why here's a Fleet in chace, Of one poor Picaroon. Elm. Oh, Heavens! Lyd. My Spirits fail, I droop. Reef. They're crowding all their Sail. They bear up faster than he likes. They've boarded himâAh, now he strikes! Lyd. Elm. Oh, Heaven! Reef. And see this Way they steer. Well, Messmates, what's the Matter here? Has. Drag him along. Vent. Oh, woeful Plight! Has. By Heaven, he shall not see the Light. A sabre, here! 1st Slave. [Behind.] âHassan, run, run! Fred. [Behind.] I will not yield. Lyd. Ah! we're undone. 'Tis Frederick's Voice. Has. He's bound at last. Strangle them both. Reef. Mess-mates, avaunt! Lyd. In pity spare him. Fred. Lydia, oh! Good Heaven, what complicated woe! Has. No Words. Reef. You're all aback, I say, The Prizes a'n't condemn'd to-day. Clap them in Irons then, and wait For further Orders. Has. Right, their Fate Till then we will suspend. CHORUS. Come on, And ere the Veil of Night be drawn, The great Bashaw's supreme Decree, Shall give them Death or Liberty. AIR. [Ah! what avails the brightest Worth] Elmira. Ah! what avails the brightest Worth That in Abdallah's Bosom flows; Tho' Truth and Reason there have Birth, Tho' there each radiant Virtue glows! Must I, at Distance plac'd, survey The Beam that other Hearts inspires, While, with unkind, averted-Ray, From me its chearing Warmth retires. AIR. [I simply wait for your Commands, Sir] I I simply wait for your Commands, Sir, Is it Peace, or is it War? Shall we quarrel, or shake Hands, Sir? Which, good Seignior, are you for? II You've nought to do, but speak your Mind, Sir, Only give me then my Cue; If for scolding you're inclin'd, Sir, I can scold as well as you. III But did you give a single Hint, Sir, That Peace and Quiet you preferr'd, There'd be no Obligation in't, Sir, I wou'd not speak another Word. AIR. [The pious Pilgrim, who from far] The pious Pilgrim, who from far Has journey'd weak and faint, The hallow'd Fabrick to revere, That holds some fav'rite Saint; Not deeper plunges in Despair, If all his Toil is vain, Than does the hopeless Suff'rer here, Nor feels severer Pain. AIR. [My true Love the cruel Sea] My true Love the cruel Sea, From me did sever, Then my poor Heart was rent in twain, For much I fear'd, ah! woe to me, That he would never To my Arms return again. What must I feel then at this Hour, If I love, if I esteem him, To see him bound, and have no power, But Sighs and Wishes to redeem him? AIR. [The Signal to engage shall be] The Signal to engage shall be A Whistle and a Hollow; Be one and all but firm like me. And Conquest soon will follow. You, Gunnel, keep the Helm in hand, Thus, thus, Boys, steady, steady; Till right a Head we see the Land, Then soon as we are ready, The Signal, &amp;c. Keep, Boys, a good look out, d'ye hear? 'Tis for old England's Honour, Just as you've brought your lower Tier Broadside to bear upon her, All Hands then, Boys, the Ship to clear, Load all your Guns and Mortars, Silent as Death th'Attack prepare, And when you're all at Quarters, The Signal, &amp;c. FINALE. Abd. Away with rough tyrannic Rules, From Reason's Precepts that depart; Be mine the Pow'r that not controuls, But mildly wins the pliant Heart! When gen'rous Dictates lead the Mind, Then, then alone of Bliss possest, In others Joys our own we find, In blessing others truly blest. Fred. Beneath such kind protecting Care, Rich Commerce spreads his golden Wings, And Science doth her Banner rear, And rugged Labour toils and sings. Lyd. The virtuous Maid, and constant Youth, Their mutual Wishes free obtain; And Love, and Innocence, and Truth, In undisturb'd Enjoyment reign. Reef. The ready Sailor quits the Shore, His Sov'reign's Honour to maintain; And when the dang'rous Toil is o'er, Partakes the Blessings of the Plain: Polly. Where Mirth amid the rural Throngs, The Triumphs of his Pow'r imparts; And Carols from a thousand Tongues, Speak lively Thoughts and grateful Hearts. CHORUS. When gen'rous Dictates, &amp;c. FINIS.</field>
