Strange that thy peace, thou trembler, flies Before a rising tear! From midst the drops my love is born, That o'er those eyelids rove: Thus issued from a teeming wave The fabled queen of love. 2 Persian Eclogues ECLOGUE THE FIRST SELIM; OR, THE SHEPHERD'S MORAL SCENE, a Valley near Bagdat TIME, the Morning âYe Persian maids, attend your poet's lays, And hear how shepherds pass their golden days: Not all are blest, whom fortune's hand sustains With wealth in courts, nor all that haunt the plains: Well may your hearts believe the truths I tell; 'Tis virtue makes the bliss, where'er we dwell.â Thus Selim sung, by sacred Truth inspired; No praise the youth, but hers alone, desired. Wise in himself, his meaning songs conveyed Informing morals to the shepherd maid, Or taught the swains that surest bliss to find, What groves nor streams bestow, a virtuous mind. When sweet and odorous, like an eastern bride, The radiant morn resumed her orient pride, When wanton gales along the valleys play, Breathe on each flower, and bear their sweets away: By Tigris' wandering waves he sat, and sung This useful lesson for the fair and young. âYe Persian dames,â he said, âto you belong, Well may they please, the morals of my song; No fairer maids, I trust, than you are found, Graced with soft arts, the peopled world around! The morn that lights you to your loves supplies Each gentler ray delicious to your eyes: For you those flowers her fragrant hands bestow, And yours the love that kings delight to know. Yet think not these, all beauteous as they are, The best kind blessings heaven can grant the fair! Who trust alone in beauty's feeble ray, Balsora's pearls have more of worth than they; Drawn from the deep, they sparkle to the sight, And all-unconscious shoot a lustrous light: Such are the maids and such the charms they boast, By sense unaided or to virtue lost. Self-flattering sex! your hearts believe in vain That love shall blind when once he fires the swain, Or hope a lover by your faults to win, As spots on ermine beautify the skin. Who seeks secure to rule, be first her care Each softer virtue that adorns the fair, Each tender passion man delights to find, The loved perfections of a female mind. âBlest were the days when Wisdom held her reign, And shepherds sought her on the silent plain; With Truth she wedded in the secret grove, The fair-eyed Truth, and daughters blessed their love. âO haste, fair maids, ye Virtues, come away, Sweet Peace and Plenty lead you on your way! The balmy shrub for you shall love our shore, By Ind excelled or Araby no more. âLost to our fields, for so the fates ordain, The dear deserters shall return again. O come thou, Modesty, as they decree, The rose may then improve her blush by thee. Here make thy court amidst our rural scene, And shepherd-girls shall own thee for their queen. With thee be Chastity, of all afraid, Distrusting all, a wise suspicious maid, But man the mostânot more the mountain doe Holds the swift falcon for her deadly foe. Cold is her breast, like flowers that drink the dew; A silken veil conceals her from the view. No wild desires amidst thy train be known, But Faith, whose heart is fixed on one alone; Desponding Meekness with her down-cast eyes, And friendly Pity full of tender sighs; And Love the last: by these your hearts approve, These are the Virtues that must lead to love.â Thus sung the swain, and eastern legends say The maids of Bagdat verified the lay: Dear to the plains, the Virtues came along, The shepherds loved, and Selim blessed his song. ECLOGUE THE SECOND HASSAN; OR, THE CAMEL-DRIVER SCENE, the Desert TIME, Mid-day In silent horror o'er the desert-waste The driver Hassan with his camels passed. One cruse of water on his back he bore, And his light scrip contained a scanty store; A fan of painted feathers in his hand, To guard his shaded face from scorching sand. The sultry sun had gained the middle sky, And not a tree and not an herb was nigh. The beasts with pain their dusty way pursue, Shrill roared the winds and dreary was the view! With desperate sorrow wild, the affrighted man Thrice sighed, thrice struck his breast, and thus began: âSad was the hour and luckless was the day, When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way. âAh! little thought I of the blasting wind, The thirst or pinching hunger that I find! Bethink thee, Hassan, where shall thirst assuage, When fails this cruse, his unrelenting rage? Soon shall this scrip its precious load resign, Then what but tears and hunger shall be thine? âYe mute companions of my toils, that bear In all my griefs a more than equal share! Here, where no springs in murmurs break away, Or moss-crowned fountains mitigate the day, In vain ye hope the green delights to know, Which plains more blest or verdant vales bestow. Here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found, And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around. Sad was the hour and luckless was the day, When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way. âCursed be the gold and silver which persuade Weak men to follow far-fatiguing trade. The Lily-Peace outshines the silver store, And life is dearer than the golden ore. Yet money tempts us o'er the desert brown, To every distant mart and wealthy town: Full oft we tempt the land and oft the sea; And are we only yet repaid by thee? Ah! why was ruin so attractive made, Or why fond man so easily betrayed? Why heed we not, whilst mad we haste along, The gentle voice of Peace or Pleasure's song? Or wherefore think the flowery mountain's side, The fountain's murmurs and the valley's pride, Why think we these less pleasing to behold Than dreary deserts, if they lead to gold? Sad was the hour and luckless was the day, When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way. âO cease, my fears! all frantic as I go, When thought creates unnumbered scenes of woe, What if the lion in his rage I meet! Oft in the dust I view his printed feet: And fearful! oft, when Day's declining light Yields her pale empire to the mourner Night, By hunger roused, he scours the groaning plain, Gaunt wolves and sullen tigers in his train: Before them death with shrieks directs their way, Fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey. Sad was the hour and luckless was the day, When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way! âAt that dead hour the silent asp shall creep, If aught of rest I find, upon my sleep; Or some swoll'n serpent twist his scales around, And wake to anguish with a burning wound. Thrice happy they, the wise contented poor, From lust of wealth and dread of death secure. They tempt no deserts and no griefs they find; Peace rules the day, where reason rules the mind. Sad was the hour and luckless was the day, When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way. âO hapless youth! for she thy love hath won, The tender Zara, will be most undone! Big swelled my heart and owned the powerful maid, When fast she dropped her tears, as thus she said: âFarewell the youth whom sighs could not detain, âWhom Zara's breaking heart implored in vain; âYet as thou goest, may every blast arise, âWeak and unfelt as these rejected sighs! âSafe o'er the wild, no perils mayst thou see, âNo griefs endure, nor weep, false youth, like me.â O let me safely to the fair return, Say with a kiss, she must not, shall not mourn. Go teach my heart to lose its painful fears, Recalled by Wisdom's voice and Zara's tears.â He said, and called on heaven to bless the day, When back to Schiraz' walls he bent his way. ECLOGUE THE THIRD ABRA; OR, THE GEORGIAN SULTANA SCENE, a forest TIME, the Evening In Georgia's land, where Tefflis' towers are seen, In distant view along the level green, While evening dews enrich the glittering glade, And the tall forests cast a longer shade, Amidst the maids of Zagen's peaceful grove, Emyra sung the pleasing cares of love. Of Abra first began the tender strain, Who led her youth with flocks upon the plain. At morn she came those willing flocks to lead, Where lilies rear them in the watery mead; From early dawn the livelong hours she told, Till late at silent ev'n she penned the fold. Deep in the grove beneath the secret shade, A various wreath of odorous flowers she made. Gay-motleyed pinks and sweet jonquils she chose, The violet-blue that on the moss-bank grows; All-sweet to sense, the flaunting rose was there; The finished chaplet well-adorned her hair. Great Abbas chanced that fated morn to stray, By love conducted from the chase away; Among the vocal vales he heard her song, And sought the vales and echoing groves among. At length he found and wooed the rural maid: She knew the monarch, and with fear obeyed. Be every youth like royal Abbas moved, And every Georgian maid like Abra loved. The royal lover bore her from the plain, Yet still her crook and bleating flock remain: Oft as she went, she backward turned her view, And bade that crook and bleating flock adieu. Fair happy maid! to other scenes remove, To richer scenes of golden power and love! Go leave the simple pipe and shepherd's strain, With love delight thee, and with Abbas reign. Be every youth like royal Abbas moved, And every Georgian maid like Abra loved. Yet midst the blaze of courts she fixed her love On the cool fountain or the shady grove; Still with the shepherd's innocence her mind To the sweet vale and flowery mead inclined, And oft as spring renewed the plains with flowers, Breathed his soft gales and led the fragrant hours, With sure return she sought the sylvan scene, The breezy mountains and the forests green. Her maids around her moved, a duteous band! Each bore a crook all-rural in her hand. Some simple lay of flocks and herds they sung; With joy the mountain and the forest rung. Be every youth like royal Abbas moved, And every Georgian maid like Abra loved. And oft the royal lover left the care And thorns of state, attendant on the fair: Oft to the shades and low-roofed cots retired, Or sought the vale where first his heart was fired; A russet mantle, like a swain, he wore, And thought of crowns and busy courts no more. Be every youth like royal Abbas moved, And every Georgian maid like Abra loved. Blest was the life that royal Abbas led: Sweet was his love and innocent his bed. What if in wealth the noble maid excel; The simple shepherd girl can love as well. Let those who rule on Persia's jewelled throne, Be famed for love and gentlest love alone: Or wreathe, like Abbas, full of fair renown, The lover's myrtle with the warrior's crown. Oh happy days! the maids around her say, Oh haste, profuse of blessings, haste away! Be every youth like royal Abbas moved, And every Georgian maid like Abra loved. ECLOGUE THE FOURTH AGIB AND SECANDER; OR, THE FUGITIVES SCENE, a Mountain in Circassia TIME, Midnight In fair Circassia, where, to love inclined, Each swain was blest, for every maid was kind! At that still hour, when awful midnight reigns, And none but wretches haunt the twilight plains; What time the moon had hung her lamp on high, And passed in radiance through the cloudless sky: Sad o'er the dews two brother shepherds fled, Where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led. Fast as they pressed their flight, behind them lay Wide ravaged plains and valleys stole away. Along the mountain's bending sides they ran, Till faint and weak Secander thus began. SECANDER O stay thee, Agib, for my feet deny, No longer friendly to my life, to fly. Friend of my heart, O turn thee and survey, Trace our sad flight through all its length of way! And first review that long-extended plain, And yon wide groves, already passed with pain! Yon ragged cliff whose dangerous path we tried, And last this lofty mountain's weary side! AGIB Weak as thou art, yet hapless must thou know The toils of flight, or some severer woe! Still as I haste, the Tartar shouts behind, And shrieks and sorrows load the saddening wind: In rage of heart, with ruin in his hand, He blasts our harvests and deforms our land. Yon citron grove, whence first in fear we came, Droops its fair honours to the conquering flame: Far fly the swains, like us, in deep despair, And leave to ruffian bands their fleecy care. SECANDER Unhappy land, whose blessings tempt the sword, In vain, unheard, thou call'st thy Persian Lord! In vain thou court'st him, helpless to thine aid, To shield the shepherd and protect the maid. Far off in thoughtless indolence resigned, Soft dreams of love and pleasure soothe his mind: Midst fair sultanas lost in idle joy, No wars alarm him and no fears annoy. AGIB Yet these green hills, in summer's sultry heat, Have lent the monarch oft a cool retreat. Sweet to the sight is Zabran's flowery plain, And once by maids and shepherds loved in vain! No more the virgins shall delight to rove By Sargis' banks or Irwan's shady grove: On Tarkie's mountain catch the cooling gale, Or breathe the sweets of Aly's flowery vale: Fair scenes! but ah! no more with peace possessed, With ease alluring and with plenty blest. No more the shepherds' whitening tents appear, Nor the kind products of a bounteous year; No more the date with snowy blossoms crowned, But Ruin spreads her baleful fires around. SECANDER In vain Circassia boasts her spicy groves, For ever famed for pure and happy loves; In vain she boasts her fairest of the fair, Their eyes' blue languish and their golden hair! Those eyes in tears their fruitless grief must send; Those hairs the Tartar's cruel hand shall rend. AGIB Ye Georgian swains that piteous learn from far Circassia's ruin and the waste of war: Some weightier arms than crooks and staves prepare, To shield your harvests and defend your fair: The Turk and Tartar like designs pursue, Fixed to destroy and steadfast to undo. Wild as his land, in native deserts bred, By lust incited or by malice led, The villain-Arab, as he prowls for prey, Oft marks with blood and wasting flames the way; Yet none so cruel as the Tartar foe, To death inured and nursed in scenes of woe. He said, when loud along the vale was heard A shriller shriek and nearer fires appeared: The affrighted shepherds through the dews of night, Wide o'er the moonlight hills, renewed their flight. 3 An Epistle: Addressed to Sir Thomas Hanmer, on his Edition of Shakespeare's Works Sir, While born to bring the Muse's happier days, A patriot's hand protects a poet's lays: While nursed by you she sees her myrtles bloom, Green and unwithered o'er his honoured tomb: Excuse her doubts, if yet she fears to tell What secret transports in her bosom swell: With conscious awe she hears the critic's fame, And blushing hides her wreath at Shakespeare's name. Hard was the lot those injured strains endured, Unowned by Science and by years obscured: Fair Fancy wept; and echoing sighs confessed A fixed despair in every tuneful breast. Not with more grief the afflicted swains appear, When wintry winds deform the plenteous year; When lingering frosts the ruined seats invade Where Peace resorted and the Graces played. Each rising art by just gradation moves, Toil builds on toil and age on age improves: The Muse alone unequal dealt her rage, And graced with noblest pomp her earliest stage. Preserved through time, the speaking scenes impart Each changeful wish of Phaedra's tortured heart; Or paint the curse that marked the Theban's reign, A bed incestuous and a father slain. With kind concern our pitying eyes o'erflow, Trace the sad tale and own another's woe. To Rome removed, with wit secure to please, The comic Sisters kept their native ease. With jealous fear declining Greece beheld Her own Menander's art almost excelled! But every muse essayed to raise in vain Some laboured rival of her tragic strain; Ilissus' laurels, though transferred with toil, Drooped their fair leaves nor knew the unfriendly soil. As arts expired, resistless dulness rose; Goths, priests or Vandals,âall were learning's foes. Till Julius first recalled each exiled Maid, And Cosmo owned them in the Etrurian shade. Then deeply skilled in love's engaging theme, The soft Provencial passed to Arno's stream: With graceful ease the wanton lyre he strung, Sweet flowed the laysâbut love was all he sung. The gay description could not fail to move; For, led by nature, all are friends to love. But heaven, still various in its works, decreed The perfect boast of time should last succeed. The beauteous union must appear at length, Of Tuscan fancy and Athenian strength: One greater muse Eliza's reign adorn, And even a Shakespeare to her fame be born! Yet ah! so bright her morning's opening ray, In vain our Britain hoped an equal day! No second growth the western isle could bear, At once exhausted with too rich a year. Too nicely Jonson knew the critic's part; Nature in him was almost lost in art. Of softer mould the gentle Fletcher came, The next in order as the next in name. With pleased attention midst his scenes we find Each glowing thought that warms the female mind; Each melting sigh, and every tender tear, The lover's wishes and the virgin's fear. His every strain the Smiles and Graces own; But stronger Shakespeare felt for man alone: Drawn by his pen, our ruder passions stand The unrivalled picture of his early hand. With gradual steps and slow, exacter France Saw Art's fair empire o'er her shores advance: By length of toil a bright perfection knew, Correctly bold and just in all she drew. Till late Corneille, with Lucan's spirit fired, Breathed the free strain, as Rome and he inspired: And classic judgment gained to sweet Racine The temperate strength of Maro's chaster line. But wilder far the British laurel spread, And wreaths less artful crown our poet's head. Yet he alone to every scene could give The historian's truth, and bid the manners live. Waked at his call I view, with glad surprise, Majestic forms of mighty monarchs rise. There Henry's trumpets spread their loud alarms, And laurelled Conquest waits her hero's arms. Here gentler Edward claims a pitying sigh, Scarce born to honours and so soon to die. Yet shall thy throne, unhappy infant, bring No beam of comfort to the guilty king? The time shall come when Gloucester's heart shall bleed In life's last hours, with horror of the deed: When dreary visions shall at last present Thy vengeful image in the midnight tent: Thy hand unseen the secret death shall bear, Blunt the weak sword and break the oppressive spear. Where'er we turn, by Fancy charmed, we find Some sweet illusion of the cheated mind. Oft, wild of wing, she calls the soul to rove With humbler nature in the rural grove; Where swains contented own the quiet scene, And twilight fairies tread the circled green: Dressed by her hand, the woods and valleys smile, And spring diffusive decks the enchanted isle. O more than all in powerful genius blest, Come, take thine empire o'er the willing breast! Whate'er the wounds this youthful heart shall feel, Thy songs support me and thy morals heal! There every thought the poet's warmth may raise, There native music dwells in all the lays. O might some verse with happiest skill persuade Expressive Picture to adopt thine aid! What wondrous drafts might rise from every page! What other Raphaels charm a distant age! Methinks even now I view some free design, Where breathing nature lives in every line: Chaste and subdued the modest lights decay, Steal into shade and mildly melt away. âAnd see, where Antony in tears approved, Guards the pale relics of the chief he loved: O'er the cold corse the warrior seems to bend, Deep sunk in grief, and mourns his murthered friend! Still as they press, he calls on all around, Lifts the torn robe and points the bleeding wound. But who is he, whose brows exalted bear A wrath impatient and a fiercer air? Awake to all that injured worth can feel, On his own Rome he turns the avenging steel. Yet shall not war's insatiate fury fall (So heaven ordains it) on the destined wall. See the fond mother midst the plaintive train Hung on his knees and prostrate on the plain! Touched to the soul, in vain he strives to hide The son's affection in the Roman's pride: O'er all the man conflicting passions rise, Rage grasps the sword, while Pity melts the eyes. Thus, generous critic, as thy bard inspires, The sister arts shall nurse their drooping fires; Each from his scenes her stores alternate bring, Blend the fair tints or wake the vocal string: Those Sibyl-leaves, the sport of every wind, (For poets ever were a careless kind), By thee disposed, no farther toil demand, But, just to nature, own thy forming hand. So spread o'er Greece, the harmonious whole unknown, Even Homer's numbers charmed by parts alone. Their own Ulysses scarce had wandered more, By winds and water cast on every shore: When, raised by fate, some former Hanmer joined Each beauteous image of the boundless mind; And bade, like thee, his Athens ever claim A fond alliance with the poet's name. 4 A Song from Shakespeare's Cymbeline Sung by Guiderus and Arviragus over Fidele, supposed to be dead To fair Fidele's grassy tomb Soft maids and village hinds shall bring Each opening sweet of earliest bloom, And rifle all the breathing spring. No wailing ghost shall dare appear To vex with shrieks this quiet grove; But shepherd lads assemble here, And melting virgins own their love. No withered witch shall here be seen, No goblins lead their nightly crew; The female fays shall haunt the green, And dress thy grave with pearly dew! The red-breast oft at evening hours Shall kindly lend his little aid: With hoary moss and gathered flowers, To deck the ground where thou art laid. When howling winds and beating rain In tempests shake the sylvan cell, Or midst the chase on every plain, The tender thought on thee shall dwell. Each lonely scene shall thee restore, For thee the tear be duly shed: Beloved, till life could charm no more, And mourned, till Pity's self be dead. 5 Song. The Sentiments Borrowed from Shakespeare Young Damon of the vale is dead, Ye lowland hamlets moan: A dewy turf lies o'er his head, And at his feet a stone. His shroud, which death's cold damps destroy, Of snow-white threads was made: All mourned to see so sweet a boy In earth for ever laid. Pale pansies o'er his corpse were placed, Which, plucked before their time, Bestrewed the boy, like him to waste And wither in their prime. But will he ne'er return, whose tongue Could tune the rural lay? Ah, no! his bell of peace is rung, His lips are cold as clay. They bore him out at twilight hour, The youth who loved so well: Ah, me! how many a true-love shower Of kind remembrance fell! Each maid was woeâbut Lucy chief, Her grief o'er all was tried; Within his grave she dropped in grief, And o'er her loved-one died. 6 Written on a Paper which Contained a Piece of Bride Cake given to the Author by a Lady Ye curious hands, that, hid from vulgar eyes, By search profane shall find this hallowed cake, With virtue's awe forbear the sacred prize, Nor dare a theft for love and pity's sake! This precious relic, formed by magic power, Beneath her shepherd's haunted pillow laid, Was meant by love to charm the silent hour, The secret present of a matchless maid. The Cyprian queen, at Hymen's fond request, Each nice ingredient chose with happiest art; Fears, sighs and wishes of the enamoured breast, And pains that please, are mixed in every part. With rosy hand the spicy fruit she brought, From Paphian hills and fair Cythera's isle; And tempered sweet with these the melting thought, The kiss ambrosial and the yielding smile; Ambiguous looks, that scorn and yet relent, Denials mild and firm unaltered truth, Reluctant pride and amorous faint consent, And meeting ardours and exulting youth. Sleep, wayward god! hath sworn, while these remain, With flattering dreams to dry his nightly tear, And cheerful Hope, so oft invoked in vain, With fairy songs shall soothe his pensive ear. If, bound by vows to friendship's gentle side, And fond of soul, thou hop'st an equal grace, If youth or maid thy joys and griefs divide, O much intreated, leave this fatal place. Sweet Peace, who long hath shunned my plaintive day, Consents at length to bring me short delight: Thy careless steps may scare her doves away, And grief with raven note usurp the night. Odes on Several Descriptive and Allegoric Subjects ? ???? ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ????? ?? ??? ????????? ??????? ???????. ? 7 Ode to Pity 1 O thou, the friend of man assigned, With balmy hands his wounds to bind, And charm his frantic woe: When first Distress with dagger keen Broke forth to waste his destined scene, His wild unsated foe! 2 By Pella's bard, a magic name, By all the griefs his thought could frame, Receive my humble rite: Long, Pity, let the nations view Thy sky-worn robes of tenderest blue, And eyes of dewy light! 3 But wherefore need I wander wide To old Ilissus' distant side, Deserted stream and mute? Wild Arun too has heard thy strains, And Echo, midst my native plains, Been soothed by Pity's lute. 4 There first the wren thy myrtles shed On gentlest Otway's infant head, To him thy cell was shown; And while he sung the female heart, With youth's soft notes unspoiled by art, Thy turtles mixed their own. 5 Come, Pity, come, by Fancy's aid, Even now my thoughts, relenting maid, Thy temple's pride design: Its southern site, its truth complete, Shall raise a wild enthusiast heat In all who view the shrine. 6 There Picture's toils shall well relate How chance or hard involving fate O'er mortal bliss prevail: The buskined Muse shall near her stand, And sighing prompt her tender hand With each disastrous tale. 7 There let me oft, retired by day, In dreams of passion melt away, Allowed with thee to dwell: There waste the mournful lamp of night, Till, virgin, thou again delight To hear a British shell! 8 Ode to Fear Thou, to whom the world unknown With all its shadowy shapes is shown; Who see'st appalled the unreal scene, While Fancy lifts the veil between: Ah Fear! Ah frantic Fear! I see, I see thee near. I know thy hurried step, thy haggard eye! Like thee I start, like thee disordered fly. For lo, what monsters in thy train appear! Danger, whose limbs of giant mould What mortal eye can fixed behold? Who stalks his round, an hideous form, Howling amidst the midnight storm, Or throws him on the ridgy steep Of some loose hanging rock to sleep; And with him thousand phantoms joined, Who prompt to deeds accursed the mind; And those, the fiends who, near allied, O'er nature's wounds and wrecks preside; Whilst Vengeance in the lurid air Lifts her red arm, exposed and bare, On whom that ravening brood of fate, Who lap the blood of sorrow, wait; Who, Fear, this ghastly train can see, And look not madly wild like thee? EPODE In earliest Greece to thee with partial choice The grief-full Muse addressed her infant tongue; The maids and matrons on her awful voice, Silent and pale, in wild amazement hung. Yet he, the bard who first invoked thy name, Disdained in Marathon its power to feel: For not alone he nursed the poet's flame, But reached from Virtue's hand the patriot's steel. But who is he whom later garlands grace, Who left awhile o'er Hybla's dews to rove, With trembling eyes thy dreary steps to trace, Where thou and Furies shared the baleful grove? Wrapped in thy cloudy veil the incestuous queen Sighed the sad call her son and husband heard, When once alone it broke the silent scene, And he, the wretch of Thebes, no more appeared. O Fear, I know thee by my throbbing heart, Thy withering power inspired each mournful line, Though gentle Pity claim her mingled part, Yet all the thunders of the scene are thine! ANTISTROPHE Thou who such weary lengths hast passed, Where wilt thou rest, mad nymph, at last? Say, wilt thou shroud in haunted cell, Where gloomy Rape and Murder dwell? Or in some hollowed seat, 'Gainst which the big waves beat, Hear drowning seamen's cries in tempests brought! Dark power, with shuddering meek submitted thought Be mine to read the visions old, Which thy awakening bards have told: And, lest thou meet my blasted view, Hold each strange tale devoutly true; Ne'er be I found, by thee o'erawed, In that thrice-hallowed eve abroad, When ghosts, as cottage-maids believe, Their pebbled beds permitted leave, And goblins haunt, from fire or fen Or mine or flood, the walks of men! O thou whose spirit most possessed The sacred seat of Shakespeare's breast! By all that from thy prophet broke, In thy divine emotions spoke, Hither again thy fury deal, Teach me but once like him to feel: His cypress wreath my meed decree, And I, O Fear, will dwell with thee! 9 Ode to Simplicity 1 O thou by Nature taught To breathe her genuine thought, In numbers warmly pure and sweetly strong: Who first on mountains wild In Fancy, loveliest child, Thy babe or Pleasure's, nursed the powers of song! 2 Thou, who with hermit heart Disdain'st the wealth of art, And gauds and pageant weeds and trailing pall: But com'st a decent maid In Attic robe arrayed, O chaste unboastful nymph, to thee I call! 3 By all the honeyed store On Hybla's thymy shore, By all her blooms and mingled murmurs dear; By her, whose love-lorn woe In evening musings slow Soothed sweetly sad Electra's poet's ear: 4 By old Cephisus deep, Who spread his wavy sweep In warbled wanderings round thy green retreat, On whose enamelled side When holy Freedom died No equal haunt allured thy future feet. 5 O sister meek of Truth, To my admiring youth Thy sober aid and native charms infuse! The flowers that sweetest breathe, Though Beauty culled the wreath, Still ask thy hand to range their ordered hues. 6 While Rome could none esteem But Virtue's patriot theme, You loved her hills and led her laureate band: But stayed to sing alone To one distinguished throne, And turned thy face, and fled her altered land. 7 No more, in hall or bower, The passions own thy power, Love, only love, her forceless numbers mean: For thou hast left her shrine, Nor olive more nor vine Shall gain thy feet to bless the servile scene. 8 Though taste, though genius bless To some divine excess, Faints the cold work till thou inspire the whole; What each, what all supply May court, may charm our eye, Thou, only thou can'st raise the meeting soul! 9 Of these let others ask To aid some mighty task: I only seek to find thy temperate vale, Where oft my reed might sound To maids and shepherds round, And all thy sons, O Nature, learn my tale. 10 Ode on the Poetical Character [1] As once, if not with light regard I read aright that gifted bard, (Him whose school above the rest His loveliest Elfin Queen has blessed) One, only one, unrivalled fair Might hope the magic girdle wear, At solemn tourney hung on high, The wish of each love-darting eye; Lo! to each other nymph in turn applied, As if, in air unseen, some hovering hand, Some chaste and angel-friend to virgin-fame, With whispered spell had burst the starting band, It left unblest her loathed, dishonoured side; Happier hopeless fair, if never Her baffled hand with vain endeavour Had touched that fatal zone to her denied! Young Fancy thus, to me divinest name, To whom, prepared and bathed in heaven, The cest of amplest power is given, To few the godlike gift assigns To gird their blest prophetic loins, And gaze her visions wild, and feel unmixed her flame! 2 The band, as fairy legends say, Was wove on that creating day When He, who called with thought to birth Yon tented sky, this laughing earth, And dressed with springs and forests tall, And poured the main engirting all, Long by the loved Enthusiast wooed, Himself in some diviner mood, Retiring, sat with her alone, And placed her on his sapphire throne, The whiles, the vaulted shrine around, Seraphic wires were heard to sound, Now sublimest triumph swelling, Now on love and mercy dwelling; And she, from out the veiling cloud, Breathed her magic notes aloud: And thou, thou rich-haired youth of morn, And all thy subject life was born! The dangerous Passions kept aloof, Far from the sainted growing woof; But near it sat ecstatic Wonder, Listening the deep applauding thunder; And Truth, in sunny vest arrayed, By whose the tarsel's eyes were made; All the shadowy tribes of Mind In braided dance their murmurs joined, And all the bright uncounted powers, Who feed on heaven's ambrosial flowers. Where is the bard, whose soul can now Its high presuming hopes avow? Where he who thinks, with rapture blind, This hallowed work for him designed? 3 High on some cliff to Heaven up-piled, Of rude access, of prospect wild, Where, tangled round the jealous steep, Strange shades o'erbrow the valleys deep, And holy genii guard the rock, Its glooms embrown, its springs unlock, While on its rich ambitious head, An Eden, like his own, lies spread; I view that oak, the fancied glades among, By which as Milton lay, his evening ear, From many a cloud that dropped ethereal dew, Nigh sphered in heaven its native strains could hear: On which that ancient trump he reached was hung; Thither oft his glory greeting, From Waller's myrtle shades retreating, With many a vow from hope's aspiring tongue, My trembling feet his guiding steps pursue: In vainâsuch bliss to one alone Of all the sons of soul was known, And Heaven and Fancy, kindred powers, Have now o'erturned the inspiring bowers, Or curtained close such scene from every future view. 11 Ode, Written in the Beginning of the Year 1746 1 How sleep the brave, who sink to rest By all their country's wishes blest! When Spring, with dewy fingers cold, Returns to deck their hallowed mould, She there shall dress a sweeter sod Than Fancy's feet have ever trod. 2 By fairy hands their knell is rung, By forms unseen their dirge is sung; There Honour comes, a pilgrim grey, To bless the turf that wraps their clay, And Freedom shall awhile repair To dwell a weeping hermit there! 12 Ode to Mercy STROPHE O thou, who sitt'st a smiling bride By Valour's armed and awful side, Gentlest of sky-born forms and best adored: Who oft with songs, divine to hear, Winn'st from his fatal grasp the spear, And hid'st in wreaths of flowers his bloodless sword! Thou who, amidst the deathful field, By godlike chiefs alone beheld, Oft with thy bosom bare art found, Pleading for him the youth who sinks to ground: See, Mercy, see, with pure and loaded hands, Before thy shrine my country's Genius stands, And decks thy altar still, though pierced with many a wound! ANTISTROPHE When he whom even our joys provoke, The Fiend of Nature, joined his yoke, And rushed in wrath to make our isle his prey, Thy form, from out thy sweet abode, O'ertook him on his blasted road, And stopped his wheels, and looked his rage away. I see recoil his sable steeds, That bore him swift to salvage deeds; Thy tender melting eyes they own. O maid, for all thy love to Britain shown, Where Justice bars her iron tower, To thee we build a roseate bower, Thou, thou shalt rule our Queen and share our Monarch's throne! 13 Ode to Liberty STROPHE Who shall awake the Spartan fife, And call in solemn sounds to life The youths, whose locks divinely spreading, Like vernal hyacinths in sullen hue, At once the breath of fear and virtue shedding, Applauding Freedom loved of old to view? What new Alcaeus, Fancy-blest, Shall sing the sword in myrtles dressed, At Wisdom's shrine awhile its flame concealing, (What place so fit to seal a deed renowned?) Till she her brightest lightnings round revealing, It leaped in glory forth and dealt her prompted wound! O goddess, in that feeling hour, When most its sounds would court thy ears, Let not my shell's misguided power E'er draw thy sad, thy mindful tears. No, Freedom, no, I will not tell How Rome, before thy weeping face, With heaviest sound, a giant-statue, fell, Pushed by a wild and artless race From off its wide ambitious base, When Time his northern sons of spoil awoke, And all the blended work of strength and grace, With many a rude repeated stroke And many a barbarous yell, to thousand fragments broke. EPODE 2 Yet even, where'er the least appeared, The admiring world thy hand revered; Still midst the scattered states around Some remnants of her strength were found; They saw by what escaped the storm How wondrous rose her perfect form; How in the great, the laboured whole, Each mighty master poured his soul! For sunny Florence, seat of art, Beneath her vines preserved a part, Till they, whom Science loved to name, (O who could fear it?) quenched her flame. And lo, an humbler relic laid In jealous Pisa's olive shade! See small Marino joins the theme, Though least, not last in thy esteem; Strike, louder strike the ennobling strings To those whose merchant sons were kings; To him who, decked with pearly pride, In Adria weds his green-haired bride; Hail, port of glory, wealth and pleasure, Ne'er let me change this Lydian measure: Nor e'er her former pride relate To sad Liguria's bleeding state. Ah no! more pleased thy haunts I seek On wild Helvetia's mountains bleak (Where, when the favoured of thy choice, The daring archer, heard thy voice, Forth from his eyrie roused in dread, The ravening Eagle northward fled); Or dwell in willowed meads more near, With those to whom thy stork is dear: Those whom the rod of Alva bruised, Whose crown a British queen refused! The magic works, thou feel'st the strains, One holier name alone remains; The perfect spell shall then avail. Hail nymph, adored by Britain, hail! ANTISTROPHE Beyond the measure vast of thought, The works the wizard Time has wrought! The Gaul, 'tis held of antique story, Saw Britain linked to his now adverse strand, No sea between nor cliff sublime and hoary: He passed with unwet feet through all our land. To the blown Baltic then, they say, The wild waves found another way, Where Orcas howls, his wolfish mountains rounding; Till all the banded West at once 'gan rise, A wide wild storm even Nature's self confounding, Withering her giant sons with strange uncouth surprise. This pillared earth so firm and wide, By winds and inward labours torn, In thunders dread was pushed aside, And down the shouldering billows borne. And see, like gems, her laughing train, The little isles on every side, Mona, once hid from those who search the main, Where thousand elfin shapes abide, And Wight who checks the westering tide, For thee consenting heaven has each bestowed, A fair attendant on her sovereign pride: To thee this blest divorce she owed, For thou hast made her vales thy loved, thy last abode! SECOND EPODE Then too, 'tis said, an hoary pile Midst the green navel of our isle, Thy shrine in some religious wood, O soul-enforcing goddess stood! There oft the painted native's feet Were wont thy form celestial meet: Though now with hopeless toil we trace Time's backward rolls to find its place; Whether the fiery-tressed Dane, Or Roman's self o'erturned the fane, Or in what heaven-left age it fell, 'Twere hard for modern song to tell. Yet still, if truth those beams infuse, Which guide at once and charm the muse, Beyond yon braided clouds that lie Paving the light-embroidered sky, Amidst the bright pavilioned plains, The beauteous model still remains. There happier than in islands blest Or bowers by spring or Hebe dressed, The chiefs who fill our Albion's story, In warlike weeds, retired in glory, Hear their consorted Druids sing Their triumphs to the immortal string. How may the poet now unfold What never tongue or numbers told? How learn delighted and amazed, What hands unknown that fabric raised? Even now before his favoured eyes, In Gothic pride it seems to rise! Yet GrÃ¦cia's graceful orders join Majestic through the mixed design. The secret builder knew to choose Each sphere-found gem of richest hues; Whate'er heaven's purer mould contains, When nearer suns emblaze its veins; There on the walls the patriot's sight May ever hang with fresh delight, And, graved with some prophetic rage, Read Albion's fame through every age. Ye forms divine, ye laureate band, That near her inmost altar stand! Now soothe her, to her blissful train Blithe Concord's social form to gain: Concord, whose myrtle wand can steep Even Anger's blood-shot eyes in sleep: Before whose breathing bosom's balm Rage drops his steel and storms grow calm; Her let our sires and matrons hoar Welcome to Britain's ravaged shore, Our youths, enamoured of the fair, Play with the tangles of her hair; Till in one loud applauding sound, The nations shout to her around: âO how supremely art thou blest, Thou, lady, thou shalt rule the West!â 14 Ode, to a Lady on the Death of Colonel Ross in the Action of Fontenoy 1 While, lost to all his former mirth, Britannia's Genius bends to earth And mourns the fatal day; While stained with blood he strives to tear Unseemly from his sea-green hair The wreaths of cheerful May; 2 The thoughts which musing Pity pays And fond Remembrance loves to raise, Your faithful hours attend: Still Fancy, to herself unkind, Awakes to grief the softened mind, And points the bleeding friend. 3 By rapid Scheldt's descending wave His country's vows shall bless the grave, Where'er the youth is laid: That sacred spot the village hind With every sweetest turf shall bind, And Peace protect the shade. 4 Blest youth, regardful of thy doom, Aerial hands shall build thy tomb, With shadowy trophies crowned: Whilst Honour bathed in tears shall rove To sigh thy name through every grove And call his heroes round. 5 The warlike dead of every age, Who fill the fair recording page, Shall leave their sainted rest: And, half-reclining on his spear, Each wondering chief by turns appear To hail the blooming guest. 6 Old Edward's sons, unknown to yield, Shall crowd from Crecy's laurelled field, And gaze with fixed delight: Again for Britain's wrongs they feel, Again they snatch the gleamy steel, And wish the avenging fight. 7 But lo! where, sunk in deep despair, Her garments torn, her bosom bare, Impatient Freedom lies! Her matted tresses madly spread, To every sod which wraps the dead She turns her joyless eyes. 8 Ne'er shall she leave that lowly ground, Till notes of triumph bursting round Proclaim her reign restored; Till William seek the sad retreat And, bleeding at her sacred feet, Present the sated sword. 9 If, weak to soothe so soft an heart, These pictured glories nought impart To dry thy constant tear; If yet, in Sorrow's distant eye, Exposed and pale thou see'st him lie, Wild War insulting near; 10 Where'er from time thou court'st relief, The Muse shall still, with social grief, Her gentlest promise keep: Even humble Harting's cottaged vale Shall learn the sad repeated tale, And bid her shepherds weep. 15 Ode to Evening If aught of oaten stop or pastoral song May hope, chaste Eve, to soothe thy modest ear, Like thy own solemn springs, Thy springs and dying gales, O nymph reserved, while now the bright-haired sun Sits in yon western tent, whose cloudy skirts, With brede ethereal wove, O'erhang his wavy bed; Now air is hushed, save where the weak-eyed bat With short shrill shriek flits by on leathern wing, Or where the beetle winds His small but sullen horn, As oft he rises midst the twilight path, Against the pilgrim borne in heedless hum: Now teach me, maid composed, To breathe some softened strain, Whose numbers stealing through thy darkening vale May not unseemly with its stillness suit; As musing slow, I hail Thy genial loved return! For when thy folding star arising shows His paly circlet, at his warning lamp The fragrant Hours, and elves Who slept in flowers the day, And many a nymph who wreathes her brows with sedge, And sheds the freshening dew, and, lovelier still, The Pensive Pleasures sweet, Prepare thy shadowy car. Then lead, calm vot'ress, where some sheety lake Cheers the lone heath, or some time-hallowed pile, Or upland fallows grey, Reflect its last cool gleam. But when chill blustering winds or driving rain Forbid my willing feet, be mine the hut That from the mountain's side Views wilds and swelling floods, And hamlets brown, and dim-discovered spires, And hears their simple bell, and marks o'er all Thy dewy fingers draw The gradual dusky veil. While Spring shall pour his showers, as oft he wont, And bathe thy breathing tresses, meekest Eve! While Summer loves to sport Beneath thy lingering light; While sallow Autumn fills thy lap with leaves, Or Winter, yelling through the troublous air, Affrights thy shrinking train, And rudely rends thy robes; So long, sure-found beneath the sylvan shed, Shall Fancy, Friendship, Science, rose-lipped Health, Thy gentlest influence own, And hymn thy favourite name! 16 Ode to Peace [1] O thou, who bad'st thy turtles bear Swift from his grasp thy golden hair, And sought'st thy native skies: When War, by vultures drawn from far, To Britain bent his iron car, And bade his storms arise! 2 Tired of his rude tyrannic sway, Our youth shall fix some festive day, His sullen shrines to burn: But thou who hear'st the turning spheres, What sounds may charm thy partial ears, And gain thy blest return! 3 O Peace, thy injured robes upbind, O rise, and leave not one behind Of all thy beamy train: The British lion, goddess sweet, Lies stretched on earth to kiss thy feet, And own thy holier reign. 4 Let others court thy transient smile, But come to grace thy western isle, By warlike Honour led! And, while around her ports rejoice, While all her sons adore thy choice, With him for ever wed! 17 The Manners. An Ode Farewell, for clearer ken designed, The dim-discovered tracts of mind: Truths which, from action's paths retired, My silent search in vain required! No more my sail that deep explores, No more I search those magic shores, What regions part the world of soul, Or whence thy streams, Opinion, roll: If e'er I round such fairy field, Some power impart the spear and shield At which the wizard Passions fly, By which the giant Follies die! Farewell the porch, whose roof is seen Arched with the enlivening olive's green: Where Science, pranked in tissued vest, By Reason, Pride, and Fancy dressed, Comes like a bride so trim arrayed, To wed with Doubt in Plato's shade! Youth of the quick uncheated sight, Thy walks, Observance, more invite! O thou, who lov'st that ampler range, Where life's wide prospects round thee change, And with her mingling sons allied, Throw'st the prattling page aside: To me in converse sweet impart To read in man the native heart, To learn, where science sure is found, From Nature as she lives around: And gazing oft her mirror true, By turns each shifting image view! Till meddling Art's officious lore Reverse the lessons taught before, Alluring from a safer rule To dream in her enchanted school; Thou Heaven, whate'er of great we boast, Hast blest this social science most. Retiring hence to thoughtful cell, As Fancy breathes her potent spell, Not vain she finds the charmful task; In pageant quaint, in motley mask, Behold before her musing eyes The countless Manners round her rise; While ever varying as they pass, To some Contempt applies her glass: With these the white-robed Maids combine, And those the laughing Satyrs join! But who is he whom now she views, In robe of wild contending hues? Thou by the Passions nursed, I greet The comic sock that binds thy feet! O Humour, thou whose name is known To Britain's favoured isle alone: Me too amidst thy band admit, There where the young-eyed healthful Wit, (Whose jewels in his crispÃ¨d hair Are placed each other's beams to share, Whom no delights from thee divide) In laughter loosed attends thy side! By old Miletus who so long Has ceased his love-inwoven song; By all you taught the Tuscan maids, In changed Italia's modern shades; By him, whose Knight's distinguished name Refined a nation's lust of fame, Whose tales even now, with echoes sweet, Castilia's Moorish hills repeat; Or him, whom Seine's blue nymphs deplore, In watchet weeds on Gallia's shore, Who drew the sad Sicilian maid, By virtues in her sire betrayed: O Nature boon, from whom proceed Each forceful thought, each prompted deed; If but from thee I hope to feel, On all my heart imprint thy seal! Let some retreating Cynic find Those oft-turned scrolls I leave behind: The Sports and I this hour agree To rove thy scene-full world with thee! 18 The Passions. An Ode for Music When Music, heavenly maid, was young, While yet in early Greece she sung, The Passions oft to hear her shell Thronged around her magic cell, Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting, Possessed beyond the muse's painting; By turns they felt the glowing mind, Disturbed, delighted, raised, refined. Till once, 'tis said, when all were fired, Filled with fury, rapt, inspired, From the supporting myrtles round They snatched her instruments of sound, And as they oft had heard apart Sweet lessons of her forceful art, Each, for madness ruled the hour, Would prove his own expressive power. First Fear his hand, its skill to try, Amid the chords bewildered laid, And back recoiled, he knew not why, Even at the sound himself had made. Next Anger rushed, his eyes on fire, In lightnings owned his secret stings, In one rude clash he struck the lyre, And swept with hurried hand the strings. With woeful measures wan Despair Low sullen sounds his grief beguiled, A solemn, strange and mingled air, 'Twas sad by fits, by starts 'twas wild. But thou, O Hope, with eyes so fair, What was thy delightful measure? Still it whispered promised pleasure, And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail! Still would her touch the strain prolong, And from the rocks, the woods, the vale, She called on Echo still through all the song; And, where her sweetest theme she chose, A soft responsive voice was heard at every close, And Hope enchanted smiled, and waved her golden hair. And longer had she sungâbut with a frown, Revenge impatient rose; He threw his blood-stained sword in thunder down, And with a withering look, The war-denouncing trumpet took, And blew a blast so loud and dread, Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe. And ever and anon he beat The doubling drum with furious heat; And though sometimes each dreary pause between, Dejected Pity at his side Her soul-subduing voice applied, Yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien, While each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head. Thy numbers, Jealousy, to nought were fixed, Sad proof of thy distressful state, Of differing themes the veering song was mixed, And now it courted Love, now raving called on Hate. With eyes up-raised, as one inspired, Pale Melancholy sat retired, And from her wild sequestered seat, In notes by distance made more sweet, Poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul: And dashing soft from rocks around, Bubbling runnels joined the sound; Through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole, Or o'er some haunted stream with fond delay, Round an holy calm diffusing, Love of peace and lonely musing, In hollow murmurs died away. But O how altered was its sprightlier tone! When Cheerfulness, a nymph of healthiest hue, Her bow across her shoulder flung, Her buskins gemmed with morning dew, Blew an inspiring air, that dale and thicket rung, The hunter's call to faun and dryad known! The oak-crowned sisters and their chaste-eyed queen, Satyrs and sylvan boys were seen, Peeping from forth their alleys green; Brown Exercise rejoiced to hear, And Sport leapt up and seized his beechen spear. Last came Joy's ecstatic trial, He with viny crown advancing, First to the lively pipe his hand addressed, But soon he saw the brisk awakening viol, Whose sweet entrancing voice he loved the best. They would have thought, who heard the strain, They saw in Tempe's vale her native maids, Amidst the festal sounding shades, To some unwearied minstrel dancing, While as his flying fingers kissed the strings, Love framed with Mirth a gay fantastic round: Loose were her tresses seen, her zone unbound, And he, amidst his frolic play, As if he would the charming air repay, Shook thousand odours from his dewy wings. O Music, sphere-descended maid, Friend of pleasure, Wisdom's aid, Why, goddess, why to us denied? Lay'st thou thy ancient lyre aside? As in that loved Athenian bower, You learned an all-commanding power, Thy mimic soul, O nymph endeared, Can well recall what then it heard. Where is thy native simple heart, Devote to virtue, fancy, art? Arise as in that elder time, Warm, energic, chaste, sublime! Thy wonders in that god-like age Fill thy recording Sister's pageâ 'Tis said, and I believe the tale, Thy humblest reed could more prevail, Had more of strength, diviner rage, Than all which charms this laggard age, Even all at once together found, Caecilia's mingled world of soundâ O bid our vain endeavors cease, Revive the just designs of Greece, Return in all thy simple state! Confirm the tales her sons relate! 19 Ode Occasioned by the Death of Mr Thomson TO GEORGE LYTTELTON, Esq; THIS ODE IS INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR ADVERTISEMENT The scene of the following stanzas is supposed to lie on the Thames near Richmond. Haec tibi semper erunt, et cum solennia vota reddemus Nymphis, et cum lustrabimus agros. ? Amavit nos quoque Daphnis. VIRG. Bucol. Eclog. v [74â5, 52] I In yonder grave a Druid lies, Where slowly winds the stealing wave! The year's best sweets shall duteous rise To deck its poet's sylvan grave! II In yon deep bed of whispering reeds His airy harp shall now be laid, That he, whose heart in sorrow bleeds, May love through life the soothing shade. III Then maids and youths shall linger here, And, while its sounds at distance swell, Shall sadly seem in Pity's ear To hear the woodland pilgrim's knell. IV Remembrance oft shall haunt the shore When Thames in summer wreaths is dressed, And oft suspend the dashing oar To bid his gentle spirit rest! V And oft as Ease and Health retire To breezy lawn or forest deep, The friend shall view yon whitening spire, And mid the varied landscape weep. VI But thou, who own'st that earthy bed, Ah! what will every dirge avail? Or tears, which Love and Pity shed That mourn beneath the gliding sail! VII Yet lives there one, whose heedless eye Shall scorn thy pale shrine glimmering near? With him, sweet bard, may Fancy die, And Joy desert the blooming year. VIII But thou, lorn stream, whose sullen tide No sedge-crowned Sisters now attend, Now waft me from the green hill's side, Whose cold turf hides the buried friend! IX And see, the fairy valleys fade, Dun Night has veiled the solemn view! âYet once again, dear parted shade, Meek Nature's child, again adieu! X The genial meads, assigned to bless Thy life, shall mourn thy early doom, Their hinds and shepherd-girls shall dress With simple hands thy rural tomb. XI Long, long, thy stone and pointed clay Shall melt the musing Briton's eyes: âO! vales and wild woodsâ, shall he say, âIn yonder grave your Druid lies!â 20 An Ode on the Popular Superstitions of the Highlands of Scotland, Considered as the Subject of Poetry [ODE TO A FRIEND ON HIS RETURN &amp;c.] 1 H[ome], thou return'st from Thames, whose Naiads long Have seen thee lingering, with a fond delay, Mid those soft friends whose hearts, some future day, Shall melt, perhaps, to hear thy tragic song. Go, not unmindful of that cordial youth, Whom, long endeared, thou leav'st by Lavant's side; Together let us wish him lasting truth, And joy untainted with his destined bride. Go! nor regardless, while these numbers boast My short-lived bliss, forget my social name; But think far off how, on the southern coast, I met thy friendship with an equal flame! Fresh to that soil thou turn'st, whose every vale Shall prompt the poet and his song demand: To thee thy copious subjects ne'er shall fail; Thou need'st but take the pencil to thy hand, And paint what all believe who own thy genial land. 2 There must thou wake perforce thy Doric quill, 'Tis Fancy's land to which thou sett'st thy feet; Where still, 'tis said, the fairy people meet Beneath each birken shade on mead or hill. There each trim lass that skims the milky store To the swart tribes their creamy bowl allots; By night they sip it round the cottage-door, While airy minstrels warble jocund notes. There every herd, by sad experience, knows How, winged with fate, their elf-shot arrows fly, When the sick ewe her summer food foregoes, Or, stretched on earth, the heart-smit heifers lie. Such airy beings awe the untutored swain: Nor thou, though learned, his homelier thoughts neglect; Let thy sweet muse the rural faith sustain: These are the themes of simple, sure effect, That add new conquests to her boundless reign, And fill with double force her heart-commanding strain. 3 Even yet preserved, how often may'st thou hear, Where to the pole the Boreal mountains run, Taught by the father to his listening son Strange lays, whose power had charmed a Spenser's ear. At every pause, before thy mind possessed, Old Runic bards shall seem to rise around With uncouth lyres, in many-coloured vest, Their matted hair with boughs fantastic crowned: Whether thou bidd'st the well-taught hind repeat The choral dirge that mourns some chieftain brave, When every shrieking maid her bosom beat, And strewed with choicest herbs his scented grave; Or whether, sitting in the shepherd's shiel, Thou hear'st some sounding tale of war's alarms; When at the bugle's call, with fire and steel, The sturdy clans poured forth their bonny swarms, And hostile brothers met to prove each other's arms. 4 'Tis thine to sing how, framing hideous spells, In Skye's lone isle the gifted wizard seer, Lodged in the wintry cave with Or in the depth of Uist's dark forests dwells; How they, whose sight such dreary dreams engross, With their own visions oft astonished droop, When o'er the watery strath or quaggy moss They see the gliding ghosts unbodied troop. Or if in sports, or on the festive green, Their glance some fated youth descry, Who, now perhaps in lusty vigour seen And rosy health, shall soon lamented die. For them the viewless forms of air obey, Their bidding heed and at their beck repair. They know what spirit brews the stormful day, And heartless, oft like moody madness stare To see the phantom train their secret work prepare. [[5.]] [Stanza 5 missing.] [Stanza]6 What though far off, from some dark dell espied, His glimmering mazes cheer the excursive sight, Yet turn, ye wanderers, turn your steps aside, Nor choose the guidance of that faithless light! For watchful, lurking mid the unrustling reed, At those mirk hours the wily monster lies, And listens oft to hear the passing steed, And frequent round him rolls his sullen eyes, If chance his savage wrath may some weak wretch surprise. [8 lines missing.] 7 Ah, luckless swain, o'er all unblest indeed! Whom late bewildered in the dank, dark fen, Far from his flocks and smoking hamlet then! To that sad spot his On him enraged the fiend, in angry mood, Shall never look with pity's kind concern, But instant, furious, rouse the whelming flood O'er its drowned banks, forbidding all return. Or, if he meditate his wished escape To some dim hill that seems uprising near, To his faint eye the grim and grisly shape In all its terrors clad shall wild appear. Meantime the waterys urge shall round him rise, Poured sudden forth from every swelling source. What now remains but tears and hopeless sighs? His fear-shook limbs have lost their youthly force, And down the waves he floats, a pale and breathless corse. 8 For him, in vain, his anxious wife shall wait, Or wander forth to meet him on his way; For him, in vain, at to-fall of the day, His bairns shall linger at the unclosing gate Ah, ne'er shall he return! Alone, if night Her travelled limbs in broken slumbers steep, With dropping willows dressed, his mournful sprite Shall visit sad, perhaps, her silent sleep: Then he, perhaps, with moist and watery hand, Shall fondly seem to press her shuddering cheek, And with his blue swoll'n face before her stand, And, shivering cold, these piteous accents speak: âPursue, dear wife, thy daily toils pursue At dawn or dusk, industrious as before; Nor e'er of me one hapless thought renew, While I lie weltering on the osiered shore, Drowned by the Kaelpie's wrath, nor e'er shall aid thee more.â 9 Unbounded is thy range; with varied style Thy Muse may, like those feathery tribes which spring From their rude rocks, extend her skirting wing Round the moist marge of each cold Hebrid isle, To that hoar pile which still its ruin shows: In whose small vaults a pigmy-folk is found, Whose bones the delver with his spade upthrows, And culls them, wondering, from the hallowed ground! Or thither, where beneath the showery west The mighty kings of three fair realms are laid; Once foes, perhaps, together now they rest. No slaves revere them and no wars invade: Yet frequent now, at midnight's solemn hour, The rifted mounds their yawning cells unfold, And forth the monarchs stalk with sovereign power In pageant robes, and wreathed with sheeny gold, And on their twilight tombs aerial council hold. 10 But O, o'er all, forget not Kilda's race, On whose bleak rocks, which brave the wasting tides, Fair Nature's daughter, Virtue, yet abides! Go, just as they, their blameless manners trace! Then to my ear transmit some gentle song Of those whose lives are yet sincere and plain, Their bounded walks the ragged cliffs along, And all their prospect but the wintry main. With sparing temperance, at the needful time, They drain the sainted spring or, hunger-pressed, Along the Atlantic rock undreading climb, And of its eggs despoil the solan's nest. Thus blest in primal innocence they live, Sufficed and happy with that frugal fare Which tasteful toil and hourly danger give. Hard is their shallow soil, and bare; Nor ever vernal bee was heard to murmur there! 11 Nor need'st thou blush that such false themes engage Thy gentle mind, of fairer stores possessed; For not alone they touch the village breast, But filled in elder time the historic page. There Shakespeare's self, with every garland crowned, In musing hour his Wayward Sisters found, And with their terrors dressed the magic scene. From them he sung, when mid his bold design, Before the Scot afflicted and aghast, The shadowy kings of Banquo's fated line, Through the dark cave in gleamy pageant passed Proceed, nor quit the tales which, simply told, Could once so well my answering bosom pierce; Proceed, in forceful sounds and colours bold The native legends of thy land rehearse; To such adapt thy lyre and suit thy powerful verse. 12 In scenes like these, which, daring to depart From sober Truth, are still to Nature true, And call forth fresh delights to Fancy's view, The heroic Muse employed her Tasso's art! How have I trembled when, at Tancred's stroke, Its gushing blood the gaping cypress poured; When each live plant with mortal accents spoke, And the wild blast upheaved the vanished sword! How have I sat, where piped the pensive wind, To hear his harp by British Fairfax strung. Prevailing poet, whose undoubting mind Believed the magic wonders which he sung! Hence at each sound imagination glows; Hence his warm lay with softest sweetness flows; Melting it flows, pure, numerous, strong and clear, And fills the impassioned heart and lulls the harmonious ear. 13 All hail, ye scenes that o'er my soul prevail, Ye firths and lakes which, far away, Are by smooth Annan filled, or pastoral Tay, Or Don's romantic springs, at distance, hail! The time shall come when I perhaps may tread Your lowly glens, o'erhung with spreading broom, Or o'er your stretching heaths by Fancy led: Then will I dress once more the faded bower, Where Jonson sat in Drummond's shade; Or crop from Tiviot's dale each And mourn on Yarrow banks Meantime, ye powers, that on the plains which bore The cordial youth, on Lothian's plains attend, Where'er he dwell, on hill or lowly muir, To him I lose your kind protection lend, And, touched with love like mine, preserve my absent friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAFTS AND FRAGMENTS 21 [Lines on Restoration Drama] Yet this wild pomp, so much in vain pursued, The courtly Davenant in our Thames renewed. For who can trace through time's o'erclouded maze The dawning stage of old Eliza's days? What critic search its rise, or changes know, With all the force of Holinshed or Stow? Yet all may gain, from many a worthless page, Some lights of Charles and his luxurious age. Then, thanks to those who sent him forth to roam, Or, equal weakness, brought the monarch home, The taste of France, her manners and her style (The fool's gay models), deluged all our isle. Those courtly wits, which spoke the nation's voice, In Paris learned their judgement and their choice. Vain were the thoughts which nature's passions speak: Thy woes, Monimia, impotent and weak! Vain all the truth of just dramatic tales: Naught pleased Augustus but what pleased Versailles! His hand of power, outstretched with princely care, From his low state upraised the instructive player; And even in palaces, for never age Was graced like Richelieu's, placed his regal stage. To those proud halls, where Burgundy had vied With all his Gallic peers in princely pride, The Muse succeeded like some splendid heir And placed her chiefs and favoured heroes there! And could that theatre, believe you, trust To those weak guides, the decent and the just? Ah, no! Could aught delight that modish pit? 'Twas but the froth and foppery of wit. True nature ceased; and in her place were seen That pride of pantomime, the rich machine. There, when some god, or spirit poised in air, Surprised the scented beau or masking fair, Think! with what thunder, in so just a cause, The mob of coxcombs swelled their loud applause! These witlings heeded nature less than they That rule thy taste, the critics of today: Yet all could talk how Betterton was dressed And gave that queen their praise who curtsied best. Thus Folly lasted long at Truth's expense, Spite of just nature or reluctant sense. Ask you what broke at last her idle reign? Wit's easy villain could not laugh in vain. 22 [Lines of Composite Authorship] But why, you'll say to me, this song? Can these proud aims to private life belong? Fair instances your verse unbidden brings, The ambitious names of ministers and kings. Am I that statesman whom a realm obeys? What ready tributes will my mandate raise? Or like the pontiff can my word command Exacted sums from every pliant land, That all of which the men of leisure read, This taste and splendour, must from me proceed? Tell me, if wits reprove or fortune frown, Where is my hope but in the uncertain town. Yet ere you urge, weigh well the mighty task: Behold what sums one poet's dramas ask. When Shakespeare shifts the place so oft to view, Must each gay scene be beautiful and new? Come, you who trade in ornament, appear, Come, join your aids through all the busy year; Plan, build and paint through each laborious day, And let us once produce this finished play. Yes, the proud cost allows some short suspense: I grant the terrors of that word âexpenceâ. Did taste at once for full perfection call, That sole objection might determine all. But such just elegance not gained at ease, Scarce wished and seen, may come by slow degrees Today may one fair grace restore, And some kind season add one beauty more. And with these aims of elegant desire, The critic's unities, 'tis sure, conspire; And though no scenes suffice to deck the wild, round their works on whom the Muse has smiled, Some scenes may still the fair design admit, Chaste scenes which Addison or Philips writ. Is but our just delight in one increased, 'Tis something gained to decency at least; And what thy judgement first by nature planned, May find completion from some future hand. &amp;c. The pomp 23 [Lines Addressed to James Harris] These would I sing: O art for ever dear, Whose charms so oft have caught my raptured ear, O teach me thou, if my unpolished lays Are all too rude to speak thy gentle praise, O teach me softer sounds of sweeter kind, Then let the Muse and Picture each contend, This plan her tale and that her colours blend: With me, though both their kindred charms combine, No power shall emulate or equal thine! And thou, the gentlest patron, born to grace And add new brightness even to Ashley's race, Intent like him in Plato's polished style To fix fair Science in our careless isle: Whether through Wilton's pictured halls you stray, Or o'er some speaking marble waste the day, Or weigh each sound, its various power to learn, Come, son of Harmony, O hither turn! Led by thy hand, Philosophy will deign To own me, meanest of her votive train. O, I will listen as thy lips impart Why all my soul obeys her powerful art; Why at her bidding, or by strange surprise Or waked by fond degrees, my passions rise; How well-formed reeds my sure attention gain And what the lyre's well-measured strings contain. The mighty masters too, unpraised so long, Shall not be lost, if thou assist my song, They who, with Pindar's in one age bestowed, Clothed the sweet words which in their numbers flowed; And Rome's and Adria's sons, if thou but strive To guard their names, shall in my name survive. 24 [Lines Addressed to Jacob Tonson] While you perhaps exclude the wintry gloom In jovial Jacob's academic room, There pleased by turns in breathing paint to trace The wit's gay air or poet's genial face, Say, happy Tonson, say what great design (For warmest gratitude must sure be thine), What due return employs thy musing heart For all the happiness their works impart; What taste-directed monument, which they Might own with smiles and thou with honour pay. Even from the days when courtly Waller sung And tuned with polished sounds our barbarous tongue, Ere yet the verse to full perfection brought With nicer music clothed the poet's thought, The muse whose song bespoke securest fame Made fair alliance with thy favoured name. Dealt from thy press, the maid of elder days Lisped the soft lines to Sacharissa's praise; Or the gay youth, for livelier spirits known, By Cowley's pointed thought improved his own. Even all the easy sons of song, who gained A poet's name when Charles and pleasure reigned, All from thy race a lasting praise derived: Not by their toil the careless bards survived. You wisely saved the race who, gay, But sought to wear the myrtles of a day. At soft Barn Elms (let every critic join) You more than all enjoy each flowing line. Yours is the price, whate'er their merits claim, Heir of their verse and guardian of their fame! move luxury and love! 25 [Lines Addressed to a Fastidious Critic] Yes, 'tis but Angelo's or Shakespeare's name: The striking beauties are in each the same. The s Were Horace dumb, who knows even Fresnoy's art Might guide the muse in some part; Or searchful Vinci, who his precepts drew For Tuscan pencils, form the poet too! From these fair arts, Obtain some fair ef Nor fear to talk of numbers or of oil, Though not quite formed like Addison or Boyle. Defect[s] in each abound and more, you say, Than sage de Piles instructs us how to weigh; Defects which, glanced on those who finely feel, All Thornhill's colours would in vain conceal, Or all the golden lines, howe'er they flow, Through each soft drama of unfruitful Rowe. These too you sometimes praise, to censure loth, But fix the name of mannerist on both. And should my friend, who knew not Anna's age, So nicely judge the canvas or the page? Still should his thought, on some old model placed, Reject the Briton with so nice a taste? From each some forceful character demand, but peculiar to his happy hand? Some sovereign mark of genius all his own, Ah, where on Thames shall gentle Dodsley find The verse contrived for so correct a mind? Or how shall Hayman, trembling as you gaze, Obtain one breath of such unwilling praise? Go then, in all unsatisfied, complain Of Time's mistake in Waller's desperate strain, For ah, âuntimely cam'st thou forthâ, indeed, With whom originals alone succeed! Go as thou wilt, require the bliss denied, To call back art and live ere Carlo died; But oh, in song the public voice obey, There let each author his day. Abroad be candid, reason as you will, And be at home a chaste Athenian still! For each correct design the critic kind Look back through age to Homer's godlike mind; But Blackhall's self might doubt if all of art Were self-produced in one exhaustless heart. 26 [Lines Addressed to a Friend about to Visit Italy] On each new scene the sons of vertÃ¹ Shall give fresh objects to thy view, Bring the graved gem or offer as you pass The imperial medal and historic brass. Then o'er its narrow surface may'st thou trace The genuine spirit of some hero's face; Or see, minutely touched, the powerful charms Of some proud fair that set whole realms in arms; The patriot's story with his look compare And know the poet by his genial air. Nor, for they boast no pure Augustan vein, Reject her poets with a cold disdain. Oh, think in what sweet lays, how sweetly strong, Our Fairfax warbles Tasso's forceful song; How Spenser too, whose lays you oft resume, Wove their gay in his fantastic loom; That Cinthio prompted oft even Shakespeare's flame, And Milton valued even Marino's name! 27 [Stanzas on a Female Painter] The moon with dewy lustre bright Her mild ethereal radiance gave, On paly cloisters gleamed her light, Or trembled o'er the unresting wave. 'Twas midnight's hourâ Long o'er the spires and glimmering towers, The whispering flood and silvery sky, As one whom musing grief devours, She glanced by turns her silent eye! Like hers, the fair Lavinia's hand Once mixed the pallet's varied store; Blest maid, whom once Italia's land In years of better glory bore! Like her, O death, O ruthless power, O grief of heart remembered well, In lovely youth's untimely hour Like her soft Tintoretta fell: Even she, whose science Philip sought To share his throne, an envied bride, Like thee deplored, ah, fatal thought, By every art lamented died. Thy draft, where Love his hand employed, Shall only please a short-lived day And, timeless like thyself destroyed, In each revolving year decay. Yet soft and melting flowed thy line, As every Grace had lent her aid, Bid each mild light unglaring shine And soft imbrowned each melting shade. And when thy tints, ah, fruitless care! With softest skill compounded lay, The flaunting bowers where spring repairs Were not more bloomy sweet than they! The child of them who now adore Thy tender tints and godlike flame, Pass some few years on Adria's shore, Shall only know thy gentle name; Or, when his eyes shall strive in vain Thy fairy pencil's stroke to trace, The faded draft shall scarce retain Some lifeless line or mangled grace. 28 âYe genii who, in secret stateâ Ye genii who, in secret state Far from the wheaten field, At some thronged city's antique gate Your unseen sceptres wield; Ye powers that such high office share O'er all the restless earth, Who see each day descend with care Or lost in senseless mirth; Take them, who know not how to prize The walks to wisdom dear, The gradual fruits and varying skies That paint the gradual year; Take all that to the silent sod Prefer the sounding street, And let your echoing squares be trod By their unresting feet. But me, by springlets laid That through the woodland chide, Let elms and oaks, that lent their shade To hoary druids, hide. Let me, where'er wild nature leads My sight, enamoured look And choose my hymning pipe from reeds That roughen o'er the brook. Sometimes, when morning o'er [the] plain Her radiant mantle throws, I'll mark the clouds where sweet Lorraine His orient colours chose; Or, when the sun to noontide climbs, I'll hide me from his view By such green plats and cheerful limes As Rysdael drew. Then on some heath, all wild and bare, With more delight I'll stand Than he who sees with wondering air The works of Rosa's hand: There where some rock's deep cavern gapes Or in some tawny dell, I'll seem to see the wizard shapes That from his pencil fell. But when soft evening o'er the plain Her gleamy mantle throws, I'll mark the clouds whence sweet Lorraine His colours chose; Or from the vale I'll lift my sight To some Where'er the sun withdraws his light, The dying lustre falls. Such will I keep Till The modest moon again shall peep Above some eastern hill. All tints that ever picture used Are lifeless, dull and mean, To paint her dewy light diffused What art can paint the modest ray, So sober, chaste and cool, As round yon cliffs it seems to play Or skirts yon glimmering pool? The tender gleam her orb affords No poet can declare, Although he choose the softest words That e'er were sighed in air. 29 To Simplicity O Fancy, altered maid, Who now, too long betrayed, To toys and pageant wedd'st thy cheated heart, Yet once with chastest thought Far nobler triumphs sought, Thrice gentle guide of each exalted art! Too No more, sweet maid, the enfeebling dreams prolong. Return, sweet maid, at length In all thy ancient strength And bid our Britain hear thy Grecian song. For thee, of loveliest name, That land shall ever claim And laid an infant on her favoured shore, Soft bees of Hybla's vale To age attests the tale To feed thy youth their s store. From that hour Thou knew'st the gentle power To charm her matrons chaste and virtuous youth; For Wisdom learned to please By thy persuasive ease And simplest sweetness more ennobled Truth. Nor modest Picture less Declined the wild excess, Which frequent now distracts her wild design: The modest Graces laid Each soft, unboastful shade, While feeling Nature drew the impassioned line! O chaste, unboastful guide, O'er all my heart preside And, midst my cave in breathing marble wrought, In sober musing near With Attic robe appear And charm my sight and prompt my temperate thought. And when soft maids and swains Reward my native strains With flowers that chastest bloom and sweetest breathe, I, loveliest nymph divine, Will own the merits thine And round thy temples bind the modest wreath. 30 âNo longer ask me, gentle friendsâ No longer ask me, gentle friends, Why heaves my constant sigh, Or why my eye for ever bends To yon fair eastern sky. Why view the clouds that onward roll? Ah, who can fate command? While here I sit, my wandering soul Is in a distant land. Did ye not hear of Delia's name, When on a fatal day O'er yonder northern hills she came And brought an earlier May? Or if the month her bloomy store By gentle custom brought, She ne'er was half so sweet before To my delighted thought. She found me in my southern vale, All in her converse blest: My heart began to fail Within my youngling breast. I thought when as her To me of lowly birth, There lived not aught so good and kind On all the smiling earth. To Resnel's banks, again to greet Her gentle eyes, I strayed, Where once a bard with infant feet Among the willows played: His tender thoughts subdue the fair And melt the soft and young, But mine I know were softer there Than ever poet sung. I showed her there the songs of one Who, done to death by pride, Though Virtue's friend and Fancy's son, In love unpitied died. I hoped when to that shepherd's truth Her pity should attend, She would not leave another youth To meet his luckless end. Now tell me, you who hear me sing And prompt the tender theme, How far is Lavant's little spring From Medway's mightier stream. Confined within my native dells, The world I little know, But in some tufted mead she dwells, Where'er those waters flow. There too resorts a maid, renowned For framing ditties sweet: I heard her lips Her gentle lays repeat. They told how sweetly in her bower A greenwood nymph complained, Of Melancholy's gloomy power, And joys from Wisdom gained. Sweet sung that muse and fair befall Her life, whose happy art, What other bards might envy all, Can touch my Laura's heart. Sweet oaten reeds for her I'll make And chaplets for her hair, If she, for friendly pity's sake, Will whisper Damon there. Her strain shall dim, if aught succeeds From my applauding tongue, Whate'er within her native meads The tuneful Thyrsis sung: Less to my love shall he be dear, Although he earliest paid Full many a soft and tender tear To luckless Collins's shade! 31 [Lines on the Music of the Grecian Theatre] Recitative Accompanied When glorious Ptolemy, by merit raised, Successive sat on Egypt's radiant throne, Bright Ptolemy, on whom while Athens gazed, She almost wished the monarch once her own: Then virtue owned one royal heart, For, loathing war, humanely wise, For all the sacred sons of art, He bade the dome of science rise. The Muses knew the festal day And, called by power, obsequant came With all their lyres and chaplets gay: They gave the fabric its immortal name. High o'er the rest in golden pride, The monarch sat and, at his side, His favourite bards, his Grecian choir, Who, while the roofs responsive rung, To many a fife and many a tinkling lyre, Amid the shouting tribes in sweet succession sung. LOST AND DOUBTFUL POEMS 36 On the Use and Abuse of Poetry The attribution of this poem is questionable. ANTISTROPHE. II. Such was wise Orpheus' moral song, The lonely cliffs and caves among; From hollow oak, or mountain-den, He drew the naked, gazing men, Or where in turf-built sheds, or rushy bowers, They shiver'd in cold wintry showers, Or sunk in heapy snows; Then sudden, while his melting music stole With powerful magic o'er each softening soul, Society, and law, and sacred order rose.
