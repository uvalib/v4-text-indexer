      <field name="fulltext">I. Literary Matters To Sir Thomas St. Serfe: on the Printing his Play Call'd “Tarugo's Wiles” Tarugo gave us wonder and delight When he oblig'd the world by candlelight. But now he's ventur'd on the face of day, T'oblige and serve his friends a nobler way, Make all our old men wits, statesmen the young, And teach ev'n Englishmen the English tongue. James, on whose reign all peaceful stars did smile, Did but attempt th'uniting of our isle. What kings and nature only cou'd design Shall be accomplished by this work of thine. For who is such a Cockney in his heart, Proud of the plenty of the Southern part, To scorn that union by which he may Boast 'twas his countryman that writ this play? Phoebus himself, indulgent to thy muse, Has to thy country sent this kind excuse: “Fair Northern lass, it is not through neglect I court thee at a distance, but respect. I cannot act, my passion is so great, But I'll make up in light what wants in heat. On these I will bestow my longest days And crown thy sons with everlasting bays. My beams that reach thee shall employ their powers To ripen souls of men, not fruits or flowers. Let warmer climes my fading favours boast: Poets and stars shine brightest in thy frost.” To Mr. Edward Howard, on his Incomparable, Incomprehensible Poem Called “The British Princes” Come on, ye critics! Find one fault who dare, For, read it backward like a witch's prayer, 'Twill do as well; throw not away your jests On solid nonsense that abides all tests. Wit, like tierce claret, when 't begins to pall, Neglected lies and's of no use at all; But in its full perfection of decay, Turns vinegar and comes again in play. This simile shall stand in thy defence 'Gainst such dull rogues as now and then write sense. He lies, dear Ned, who says thy brain is barren, Where deep conceits, like vermin, breed in carrion; Thou hast a brain, such as thou hast, indeed— On what else should thy worm of fancy feed? Yet in a filbert I have often known Maggots survive when all the kernel's gone. Thy style's the same whatever be the theme, As some digestions turn all meat to phlegm: Thy stumbling, founder'd jade can trot as high As any other Pegasus can fly. As skillful divers to the bottom fall Sooner than those that cannot swim at all, So in this way of writing without thinking Thou hast a strange alacrity in sinking: Thou writest below e'en thy own natural parts And with acquired dullness and new arts Of studied nonsense tak'st kind readers' heart. So the dull eel moves nimbler in the mud Than all the swift-finn'd racers of the flood. Therefore, dear Ned, at my advice forbear Such loud complaints 'gainst critics to prefer, Since thou art turn'd an arrant libeller: Thou sett'st thy name to what thyself dost write; Did ever libel yet so sharply bite? Epilogue to “Every Man in his Humour” Entreaty shall not serve, nor violence, To make me speak in such a play's defence; A play where wit and humour do agree To break all practis'd laws of comedy. The scene (what more absurd!) in England lies, No gods descend nor dancing devils rise; No captive prince from nameless country brought, No battle, nay there's not a duel fought, And something yet more sharply might be said, But I consider the poor author's dead: Let that be his excuse—now for our own, Why—faith, in my opinion, we need none. The parts were fitted well, but some will say, “Pox on 'em, rogues, what made 'em choose this play?” I do not doubt but you will credit me It was not choice but mere necessity; To all our writing friends in town we sent, But not a wit durst venture out in Lent: Have patience but 'till Easter term, and then You shall have jig and hobbyhorse again. Here's Mr. Matthew, our domestic wit, Does promise one of the ten plays h'as writ; But since great bribes weigh nothing with the just, Know we have merits and in them we trust. When any fasts or holidays defer The public labors of the theatre, We ride not forth, although the day be fair, On ambling tit to take the suburb air; But with our authors meet, and spend that time To make up quarrels between sense and rhyme. Wednesday and Fridays constantly we sate, Till after many a long and free debate, For divers weighty reasons 'twas thought fit, Unruly sense should still to rhyme submit. This, the most wholesome law we ever made, So strictly in this epilogue obey'd, Sure no man here will ever dare to break. [Enter Johnson's Ghost.] Hold, and give way, for I myself will speak; Can you encourage so much insolence, And add new faults still to the great offence Your ancestors so rashly did commit Against the mighty powers of art and wit? When they condemn'd those noble works of mine, Sejanus and my best lov'd Cataline: Repent, or on your guilty heads shall fall The curse of many a rhyming pastoral. The three bold Beauchamps shall revive again, And with the London prentice conquer Spain. All the dull follies of the former age, Shall rise and find applause upon this stage. But if you pay the great arrears of praise So long since due to my much-injured plays, From all past crimes I first will set you free, And then inspire some one to write like me. Epilogue to “Tartuffe” Many have been the vain attempts of wit Against the still prevailing hypocrite. Once, and but once, a poet got the day, And vanquish't Busy in a puppet play. But Busy rallying, arm'd with zeal and rage, Possessed the pulpit and pull'd down the stage. To laugh at English knaves is dangerous then, Whilst English fools will think them honest men. But sure no zealous Rabbi will deny us Free leave to act our Monsieur Ananias. A man may say without being thought an atheist There are damn'd rogues amongst the French and Papist That fix salvation to short bands and hair, That belch and snuffle to prolong a prayer, That use “enjoy the creature” to express Plain whoring, gluttony, and drunkenness; And in a decent way perform them too, As well, nay better far, alas, than you Whose fleshly failings are but fornication— We Godly phrase it “gospel propagation,” Just as rebellion was call'd reformation. Though zeal stand sentry at the gate of sin, Yet all that have the word pass freely in; Silent and in the dark for fear of spies We march and take damnation by surprise. There's not a roaring blade about the town Can go so far towards Hell for half a crown As I for sixpence, because I know the way: For want of guides, men are too apt to stray. Therefore give ear to what I shall advise: Let every married man that's rich and wise Take a Tartuffe of known ability To teach and to increase his family, Who may to settle lasting reformation First get his son, then give him education. On Mr. Edward Howard upon his “New Utopia” Thou damn'd antipodes to common sense! Thou foil to Flecknoe! Prithee tell from whence Does all this mighty stock of dullness spring, Which in such loads thou to the stage dost bring? Is't all thy own, or hast thou from Snow Hill Th'assistance of some ballad-making quill? No, they fly higher yet; thy plays are such I'd swear they were translated out of Dutch: And who the devil was e'er yet so drunk To own the volumes of Mynheer Van Dunk? Fain would I know what diet thou dost keep, If thou dost always or dost never sleep. Sure hasty pudding is thy chiefest dish; With lights and livers and with stinking fish, Oxcheek, tripe, garbage, thou dost treat thy brain, Which nobly pays this tribute back again. With daisy roots thy dwarfish muse is fed: A giant's body with a pigmy's head. Canst thou not find 'mongst all thy num'rous race One friend so kind to tell thee that thy play's Laugh'd at by box, pit, gallery, nay stage And grown the nauseous grievance of this age? Think on't a while, and thou wilt quickly find Thy body made for labor, not thy mind. No other use of paper thou should'st make But carrying loads of reams upon thy back. Carry vast burdens 'till thy shoulders shrink, But curs'd be he that gives thee pen and ink: Those dang'rous weapons should be kept from fools, As nurses from their children keep edge tools. For thy dull muse a muckender were fit To wipe the slav'rings of her infant wit, Which, though 'tis late, if justice could be found, Should like blind, new-born puppies yet be drown'd. For were it not we must respect afford To any muse that's grandchild to a lord, Thine in the ducking stool should take her seat, Drench'd like herself in a great chair of state, Where like a muse of quality she'll die, And thou thyself shalt make her elegy In the same strain thou writ'st thy comedy. To Mr. Bays Thou mercenary renegade, thou slave, Thou ever changing, still to be a knave: What sect, what error wilt thou next disgrace? Thou art so lewd, so scandalously base, That antichristian Popery may be Asham'd of such a proselite as thee. Not all the rancour and felonious spite Which animates thy lumpish soul to write Could have contriv'd a satire more severe, Or more disgrac'd the cause thou wouldst prefer. Yet in thy favor this must be confest: It suits with thy poetic genius best. There thou. . . . Thy mind, disus'd to truth, must entertain With tales more monstrous, fanciful, and vain Than ev'n thy poetry could ever feign. Or sing the lives of thy own fellow saints— 'Tis a large field and thy assistance wants. Thence copy out new operas for the stage, And with their miracles divert the age. Such is thy faith, if thou hast faith indeed, For well we may distrust the poet's creed; Rebel to God, blasphemer of the king, Oh, tell whence could this strange compliance spring: So may'st thou prove to thy new gods as true As thy old friend the Devil has been to you; Still conscience and religion's the pretence, But food and drink the mythologic sense. 'Twas interest reconcil'd thee to the cheat, And vain ambition prompted thee to eat. Oh, how persuasive is the want of bread! Not reasons from strong box more strongly plead. A convert thou! Why, 'tis past all believing, 'Tis a damn'd scandal of thy foes' contriving, A jest of that malicious monster, fame: The honest layman's faith is still the same. The Duel Of Clineas' and Dametas' sharper fight I've neither leisure nor design to write; Of blood and wounds let bolder poets sing: My muse shall of our modern heroes sing. In humble verse I'll only dare to tell How brawny Bavius and slim Maevius fell At odds, and in their bloodless rhyming strife There was no jeopardy of limbs or life. Bold's thy attempt, Will Maevius, to engage Bob Bavius, the macninny of the age: Redoubled blockhead, eminently dull, The lyric poet with the sevenfold skull. A head that's guarded has a sure defence Against the weak attacks of wit and sense. Thus arm'd, the mighty hero takes the field, And in his fist a swinging pen does wield, Drawn from a swan's white wing with art and care, One of the largest weapons poets wear; For swan and goose and crow, sometimes we see, Afford the rhyming crew artillery. With this dire weapon, harmless without skill, He vows to be reveng'd on whiffling Will: Will, a pert youth, a scandal scribbling elf, Whom Bob had brought up dully like himself; He taught his feeble hand to trail a quill And nicely did direct him to write ill. He shew'd him first the art or surest way Of writing an insipid roundelay. Of any word Bob makes a mercury, For any dunce can write as well as he; When this Will knew, he straight rejects his sway, And tho' a minor blockhead, scorns to obey, Undone by false admirers of his wit, For some dull coxcombs prais'd what he had writ. Pamper'd with praise, the fop grows proud and vain, And foolish commendation turn'd his brain. This made him in poetic frenzy raise Legions of verse to fight for blasted bays; That sneering, sniveling, scribbling knight, his friend, Has levy'd rhymes, and both with Bob contend, But such a wretched rhymer he is found, With lasting fame for dullness, he is crown'd. Angry at their revolt, with passion wild, Bob Bavius swore he'd ne'er be reconcil'd; In wrath contracts his forehead with a frown, And with his pen's butt end knocks poor Will down. Will whips his crow quill up in his defence, And swore the world should judge who writ most sense. When pigmies fight, the cranes straight part the fray, And whirl the little combatants away. Let this similitude give no offence, For gyant Bob like Will's a dwarf in sense. Qui Bavium non odit, amet tua carmina Maevi. A True Account of the Birth and Conception of a Late Famous Poem call'd “The Female Nine” When Monmouth the chaste read those impudent lines Which ty'd her dear monkey so fast by the loins, Show'd his jackanapes tricks and his apish false smiles, And set him a chattering aloft on the tiles, She saw with a fright, Howe'er they came by't, The rogues had describ'd pretty whirligig right. And none can be certain, when scandals begin To draw so near home, but that they shall come in. She heard that the nine ladies' turn would be next, And fearing some bungler should mangle the text And paint her sweet person like some hagged elf, She wisely contriv'd how to draw it herself; And luckily hit On a method most fit At once to display both her virtue and wit, Not doubting to have from herself a good word, And thus she bespoke the kind help of her lord: “Methinks the same nine which they count so well writ Has nothing of air, bon sens, or l'esprit. The numbers so rough and so harsh the cadence, As would blister a mouth embellished in France. Come pour amusement Let us make a song And so do ourselves right, whome'er we do wrong. We'll give a beau tour to the feminine nine, Among whom my prudence and virtue shall shine. You yourself shall appear the great Turk of the scene And I'll recommend you so far to the Queen, And soothe the vain humor to which you incline, As to make you belov'd by two of the nine. And that's very fair For a poor, sickly peer, Who to my certain knowledge has nothing to spare; And since these lampoons are the wit of the times, I'll furnish the sense if you'll tag it with rhymes.” Her spouse, fir'd at this, scream'd aloud and leapt forth, And fetching his dead-doing pen in his wrath, He workt off his piece with such art of the pen That he aim'd at the ladies but wounded the men; And labour'd so hard The doors were all barr'd, And none was admitted but trusty Blanchard.

Old Affected Court Ladies The Antiquated Coquette Phyllis, if you will not agree To give me back my liberty, In spite of you I must regain My loss of time and break your chain. You were mistaken if you thought I was so grossly to be caught; Or that I was so blindly bred, As not to be in woman read. Perhaps you took me for a fool, Design'd alone your sex's tool; Nay, you might think so made a thing, That with a little fashioning, I might in time for your dear sake, That monster call'd a husband make: Perhaps I might, had I not found One darling vice in you abound— A vice to me which e'er will prove An antidote to banish love. O! I could better bear an old, Ugly, diseas'd, misshapen scold, Or one who games, or will be drunk, A fool, a spendthrift, bawd, or punk, Than one at all who wildly flies, And with soft, asking, giving eyes, And thousand other wanton arts, So meanly trades in begging hearts. How might such wond'rous charms perplex, Give chains or death to all our sex, Did she not so unwisely set For ev'ry flutt'ring fool her net! So poorly proud of vulgar praise, Her very look her thoughts betrays: She never stays till we begin, But beckons us her self to sin. Ere we can ask, she cries consent, So quick her yielding looks are sent, They hope forestall and ev'n desire prevent. But nature's turn'd when women woo— We hate in them what we should do; Desire's asleep and cannot wake When women such advances make: Both time and charms thus Phyllis wastes, Since each must surfeit ere he tastes. Nothing escapes her wand'ring eyes, No one she thinks too mean a prize; E'en Lynch, the lag of human kind, Nearest to brutes by God design'd, May boast the smiles of this coquette, As much as any man of wit. The signs hang thinner in the Strand, The Dutch scarce more infest the land, Tho' Egypt's locusts they outvie, In number and voracity. Whores are not half so plenty found, In playhouse or that hallow'd ground Of Temple Walks or Whetstone's Park: Caresses less abound in Spark. Then with kind looks for all who come At bawdyhouse, the drawing room, But all in vain she throws her darts— They hit but cannot hurt our hearts. Age has enerv'd her charms so much, That fearless all her eyes approach; Each her autumnal face degrades With “Rev'rend Mother of the Maids”! But 'tis ill-natur'd to run on, Forgetting what her charms have done; To Teagueland we this beauty owe, Teagueland her earliest charms did know: There first her tyrant beauties reign'd, Where'er she look'd she conquest gain'd. No heart the glances could repel, The Teagues by shoals before her fell; And trotting bogs was all the art The sound had left to save his heart. She kill'd so fast, by my salvation, She ne'er dispeopl'd had the nation, Tho' she, good soul, to save took care All, all she could from sad despair. From thence she hither came to prove If yet her charms could kindle love. But ah! it was too late to try, For spring was gone and winter nigh: Yet tho' her eyes such conquests made That they were shunn'd or else obey'd, Yet now her charms are so decay'd, She thanks each coxcomb that will deign To praise her face and wear her chain. So some old soldier who had done Wonders in youth and battles won, When feeble years his strength depose, That he too weak to vanquish grows, With mangled face and wooden leg, Reduc'd about for alms to beg, O'erjoy'd, a thousand thanks bestows On him who but a farthing throws. On the Countess Dowager of Manchester Courage, dear Moll, and drive away despair. Mopsa, who in her youth was scarce thought fair, In spite of age, experience, and decays, Sets up for charming in her fading days; Snuffs her dim eyes to give one parting blow, Have at the heart of every ogling beau! This goodly goose, all feather'd like a jay, So gravely vain and so demurely gay, Last night, to grace the Court, did overload Her bald buff forehead with a high commode; Her steps were manag'd with such tender art, As if each board had been a lover's heart. In all her air, in every glance, was seen A mixture strange, 'twixt fifty and fifteen. Crowds of admiring fops about her press; Hampden himself delivers their address, Which she, accepting with a nice disdain, Owns them her subjects and begins to reign. Fair Queen of Fopland is her royal stile— Fopland! the greatest part of this great isle! Nature did ne'er more equally divide A female heart, 'twixt piety and pride. Her watchful maids prevent the peep of day, And all in order on her toilet lay: Prayer books and patch box, sermon notes and paint, At once t'improve the sinner and the saint. Farewell, friend Moll: expect no more from me; But if you would a full description see, You'll find her somewhere in the litany, With pride, vainglory, and hypocrisy. Four Poems on the Countess of Dorchester I. [Sylvia, methinks you are unfit] Sylvia, methinks you are unfit For your great Lord's embrace; For tho' we all allow you wit, We can't a handsome face. Then where's the pleasure, where's the good Of spending time and cost? For if your wit ben't understood, Your keeper's bliss is lost II. [Dorinda's sparkling wit and eyes] Dorinda's sparkling wit and eyes, United, cast too fierce a light, Which blazes high but quickly dies, Warms not the heart but hurts the sight. Love is a calm and tender joy, Kind are his looks and soft his pace; Her Cupid is a blackguard boy That runs his link into your face. III. [Proud with the spoils of royal cully] Proud with the spoils of royal cully, With false pretence to wit and parts, She swaggers like a batter'd bully To try the tempers of men's hearts. Tho' she appears as gay and fine As jet and gems and paint can make her, She ne'er shall win a heart like mine— The devil or Sir Davy take her. Her bed is like the Scripture feast, Where none who were invited came, So disappointed of her guest, She took up with the blind and lame. IV. [Tell me, Dorinda, why so gay] Tell me, Dorinda, why so gay, Why such embroid'ry, fringe, and lace? Can any dresses find a way To stop th'approaches of decay And mend thy ruin'd face? Wilt thou still sparkle in the box, And ogle in the ring? Canst thou forget thy age and pox? Can all that shines on shells and rocks Make thee a fine young thing? So have I seen in larder dark Of veal a lucid loin, Replete with many a heatless spark, As wise philosophers remark, At once both stink and shine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. State Affairs Catch When rebels first push'd at the Crown, Both p? and prelate then went down. No men to f? were inclin'd; Poor c? to death was almost pin'd. In every street We daily did meet Instead of whores an armed train. But now honest c? Shall flourish as 'twas wont, For the King enjoys his own again. On the Young Statesmen [My muse and I are drunk tonight, And both of us must spew; This indigested stuff I write To ease my mind I must indite, And libel must ensue. Shall I the morals of the Court Or politics display? Their morals will make the best sport, For little wit of the worser sort Will go a mighty way. Of little cheats the Court is full; Our princes only dream. Nay even our new made Governor of Hull By Dryden's help is not so dull On such an ample theme.] Clarendon had law and sense, Clifford was fierce and brave, Bennet's grave look was a pretense, And Danby's matchless impudence Help'd to support the knave. But Sunderland, Godolphin, and Lory Turn politics to jests And will appear such chits in story To be repeated like John Dory, When fiddlers sing at feasts. Protect us, mighty providence; What would these madmen have? First, they would bribe us without pence, Deceive us without common sense, And without power enslave. Shall freeborn men in humble awe Submit to servile shame, Who from consent and custom draw The same right to be ruled by law, Which kings pretend to reign? The Duke shall wield his conq'ring sword, The Chancellor make a speech, The King shall pass his honest word, The pawn'd revenue sums afford— And then come kiss my breech. So have I seen a king at chess, (His rooks and knights withdrawn, His queen and bishops in distress) Shifting about, grow less and less, And here and there a pawn. [But oh! the whore, the mighty whore, Joined with thy hair-brain'd brother, Will keep thee still despised and poor 'Till rebels turn thee out of door, And France brings in another.] My Opinion After thinking this fortnight of Whig and of Tory, This to me is the long and the short of the story: They are all fools and knaves, and they keep up this pother On both sides, designing to cheat one another. Poor Rowley, whose maxims of state are a riddle, Has plac'd himself much like the pin in the middle; Let which corner soever be tumbl'd down first, 'Tis ten thousand to one but he comes by the worst. 'Twixt brother and bastard, those Dukes of renown, He'll make a wise shift to get rid of his crown; Had he half common sense, were it ne'er so uncivil, He'd have had 'em long since tipp'd down to the Devil. The first is a Prince well fashion'd, well featur'd, No bigot to speak of, not false nor ill-natur'd; The other for government can't be unfit, He's so little a fop and so plaguy a wit. Had I this soft son and this dangerous brother, I'd hang up the one and I'd piss on the other; I'd make this the long and the short of the story: The fools might be Whigs, none but knaves should be Tories. On the Statue in the Privy Garden When Israel first provoked the living Lord, He scourged their sin with famine, plague, and sword. All they and more could no repentance bring; Then in a greater rage he sent them such a king, A James-like king, as his severest rod, The utmost vengeance of an angry God. God in his wrath gave Saul to sinful Jewry And Second James to us in greater fury, For Saul in sin was no more like our James Than little Jordan can compare with Thames. On King William's Happy Deliverance from the Intended Assassination The youth whose fortune the vast globe obey'd, Finding his royal enemy betray'd And in his chariot by vile hands opprest, With noble pity and just rage posses't, Wept at the fall of so sublime a state And with the traitor's death reveng'd the fate Of monarchy profane; so acted too The generous Caesar when the Roman knew A coward king had treacherously slain One he scarce foil'd on the Pharsalian plain. The doom of his fam'd rival he bemoan'd And the base author of the crime dethron'd. So virtuous was the actions of the great, Far from the guilty acts of desperate hate: They knew no foe, but in the open field, And to their cause and to their gods appeal'd. So William acts, and if his rivals dare Dispute his right by arms, he'll meet them there Where Jove, as once on Ida, holds the scale And lets the good, the just, the brave prevail.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. Advice to Lovers A Ballad by the Lord Dorset when at Sea 1 To all you ladies now at land, We men at sea do write, But first I hope you'll understand How hard 'tis to indite: The muses now and Neptune too We must implore to write to you. With a fa, la, la, la, la. 2 For though the muses should be kind And fill our empty brain, Yet when rough Neptune calls the wind To rouse the azure main, Our paper, ink, and pen, and we Roll up and down our ships at sea. With a fa, la, la, la, la. 3 Then, if we write not by each post, Think not we are unkind, Nor yet conclude that we are lost By Dutch or else by wind; Our tears we'll send a speedier way: The tide shall bring them twice a day. With a fa, la, la, la, la. 4 With wonder and amaze the king Will vow his seas grow bold, Because the tides more waters bring Than they were wont of old; But you must tell him that our cares Send floods of grief to Whitehall Stairs. With a fa, la, la, la, la. 5 To pass the tedious hours away, We throw the merry main, Or else at serious ombre play; But why should we in vain Each other's ruin thus pursue? We were undone when we left you. With a fa, la, la, la, la. 6 If foggy Opdam did but know Our sad and dismal story, The Dutch would scorn so weak a foe, And leave the port of Goree; For what resistance can they find From men that left their hearts behind? With a fa, la, la, la, la. 7 Let wind and weather do their worst, Be you to us but kind; Let Frenchmen vapor, Dutchmen curse, No sorrow shall we find: 'Tis then no matter how things go, Nor who's our friend, nor who's our foe. With a fa, la, la, la, la. 8 In justice, you cannot refuse To think of our distress, Since we in hope of honor lose Our certain happiness; All our designs are but to prove Ourselves more worthy of your love. With a fa, la, la, la, la. 9 Alas! our fears tempestuous grow And cast our hopes away, While you, unmindful of our woe, Sit careless at a play: And now permit some happier man To kiss your busk and wag your fan. With a fa, la, la, la, la. 10 When any mournful tune you hear, That dies in every note As if it sighed for each man's care For being so remote, Think then how oft our love we made To you while all those tunes were played. With a fa, la, la, la, la. 11 And now we have told our love, And also all our fears, We hope our declarations move Some pity for our tears; Let's hear of no inconstancy— We have too much of that at sea. With a fa, la, la, la, la. To Phyllis Phyllis, though your powerful charms Have forc'd me from my Celia's arms, That sure defence against all powers But those resistless eyes of yours, Think not your conquest to maintain By rigor or unjust disdain. In vain, fair nymph, in vain you strive For love does seldom hope survive; My heart may languish for a time, While all your glories in their prime May justify such cruelty By the same force that conquer'd me. When age shall come, at whose command Those troops of beauties must disband, A tyrant's strength once took away, What slave so dull as to obey? Those threatening dangers to remove, Make me believe at least you love; Dissemble well and by that art Preserve and govern still my heart. But if you'll choose another way To save your empire from decay, Oh then forever fix your throne: Be kind, but kind to me alone. Knotting At noon in a sunshiny day The brightest lady of the May, Young Chloris innocent and gay, Sat knotting in a shade. Each slender finger play'd its part With such activity and art As would inflame a youthful heart And warm the most decay'd. Her favorite swain by chance came by No sight could better please her eye; Yet when the bashful boy drew nigh, She wou'd have seem'd afraid. She let her ivory needle fall, And hurl'd away the twisted ball, But straight gave Strephon such a call, As wou'd have rais'd the dead. “Dear gentle youth, is't none but thee? With innocence I dare be free; By so much trust and modesty, No nymph was e'er betray'd. Come lean they head upon my lap, While thy smooth cheeks I stroke and clap; Thou may'st securely take a nap”: Which he, poor fool, obey'd. She saw him yawn and heard him snore, And found him fast asleep all o'er. She sigh'd, and cou'd endure no more, But starting up she said, “Such virtue shall rewarded be: For this thy dull fidelity, I'll trust thee with my flocks, not me, Pursue thy grazing trade. Go milk thy goats, and shear thy sheep, And watch all night thy flocks to keep; Thou shalt no more be lull'd asleep By me, mistaken maid.” Song [Corydon beneath a willow] Corydon beneath a willow, By a murmuring current laid, His arm reclin'd, the lover's pillow, Thus address'd the charming maid. O! my Sacharissa, tell How could Nature take delight, That a heart so hard should dwell In a frame so soft and white. Could you feel but half the anguish, Half the tortures that I bear, How for you I daily languish, You'd be kind as you are fair. See the fire that in me reigns, O! behold a burning man; Think I feel my dying pains, And be cruel if you can. With her conquest pleas'd, the dame Cry'd, with an insulting look, Yes, I fain would quench your flame; She spoke, and pointed to the brook. A Song to Chloris, from the Blind Archer Ah! Chloris, 'tis time to disarm your bright eyes, And lay by those terrible glances; We live in an age that's more civil and wise Than to follow the rules of romances. When once your round bubbies begin but to pout, They'll allow you no long time of courting; And you'll find it a very hard task to hold out, For all maidens are mortal at fourteen. The Advice Phyllis, for shame let us improve A thousand several ways These few short minutes stol'n by love From many tedious days. Whilst you want courage to despise The censure of the grave, For all the tyrants in your eyes Your heart is but a slave. My love is full of noble pride And never will submit To let that fop, discretion, ride In triumph over it. False friends I have, as well as you, Who daily counsel me Fame and ambition to pursue, And leave off loving thee. When I the least belief bestow On what such fools advise, May I be dull enough to grow Most miserably wise. A Song [May the ambitious ever find] May the ambitious ever find Reward in crowds and noise, Whilst gentle love does fill my mind With silent real joys. May fools and knaves grow rich and great, And the world think 'em wise, Whilst I lie dying at her feet, And all that world despise. Let conquering kings new trophies raise, And melt in court delights: Her eyes can give me brighter days, Her arms much softer nights. A Song [Phyllis, the fairest of love's foes] Phyllis, the fairest of love's foes, Yet fiercer than a dragon, Phyllis that scorn'd the powder'd beaus What has she now to brag on? Since while she kept her legs so close, Her breech had scarce a rag on. Compell'd by want, this wretched maid Did sad complaints begin, Which surly Strephon, hearing, said It was both shame and sin To pity such a lazy jade That wou'd neither kiss nor spin. Advice to Lovers Damon, if thou wilt believe me, 'Tis not sighing round the plain; Song nor sonnet can relieve thee; Faint attempts in love are vain. Urge but home the fair occasion, And be master of the field; To a powerful kind invasion, 'Twere a madness not to yield. Tho' she swears she'll ne'er permit you, Cries you're rude and much to blame; And with tears implores your pity, Be not mercifull, for shame. When the fierce assault is over, Chloris time enough may find This, her cruel furious lover, Much more gentle, not so kind. Love gives out a large commission, Still indulgent to the brave; But one sin of base omission Never woman yet forgave. But true vigour in performing, Turns the tragic scene to farce; And she'll rise appeas'd next morning, With dry eyes and a wet a?. The Advice Would you in love succeed, be brisk, be gay, Cast all dull thoughts and serious looks away; Think not with down cast eyes and mournful air To move to pity the relentless fair, Or draw from her bright eyes a crystal tear. This method foreign is to your affair, Too formal for the frolic you prepare: Thus, when you think she yields to love's advance, You'll find 'tis no consent but compliasance. Whilst he who boldly rifles all her charms, Kisses and ravishes her in his arms, Seizes the favor, stays not for a grant, Alarms her blood and makes her sigh and pant, Gives her no time to speak or think't a crime, Enjoys his wish and well employs his time. The Fire of Love The fire of love in youthful blood, Like what is kindled in brush wood, But for a moment burns, Yet in that moment makes a mighty noise. It crackles and to vapor turns, And soon itself destroys. But when crept into aged veins, It slowly burns and long remains, And with a sullen heat, Like fire in logs, it glows and warms 'em long; And though the flame be not so great, Yet is the heat as strong.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. Friends and Acquaintances On Dolly Chamberlain A Sempstress in the New Exchange Dolly's beauty and art Have so hemm'd in my heart That I cannot resist the charm: In revenge I will stitch Up the hole next her breech With a needle as long as my arm. A Song on Black Bess Methinks the poor town has been troubled too long With Phyllis and Chloris in every song, By fools who at once can both love and despair, And will never leave calling them cruel and fair: Which justly provokes me in rhyme to express The truth that I know of bonny Black Bess. This Bess of my heart, this Bess of my soul, Has a skin white as milk and hair black as coal; She's plump, yet with ease you may span round her waist, But her round swelling thighs can scarce be embrac'd: Her belly is soft, not a word of the rest, But I know what I think when I drink to the best. The plowman and squire, the arranter clown, At home she subdu'd in her paragon gown; But now she adorns the boxes and pit, And the proudest town gallants are forc'd to submit. All hearts fall a leaping whenever she comes, And beat day and night like my Lord Craven's drums. I dare not permit her to come to Whitehall, For she'd outshine the ladies, paint, jewels, and all. If a lord shou'd but whisper his love in the crowd, She'd sell him a bargain and laugh out aloud; Then the Queen, overhearing what Betty did say, Would send Mr. Roper to take her away. But to those that have had my dear Bess in their arms, She's gentle and knows how to soften her charms; And to every beauty can add a new grace, Having learn'd how to lisp and to trip in her pace; And with head on one side and a languishing eye, To kill us by looking as if she would die. Epitaph on Mrs. Lundy Here lies little Lundy a yard deep or more, That never lay silent or quiet before, For her brain was still working, her tongue was still prating, And the pulse of her heart continually beating, To the utmost extremes of loving and hating. Her reason and humor were always at strife, But yet she perform'd all the duties of life, For she was a true friend and a pretty good wife. So indulgent a mother that no one could say Whether Minty or Patty did rule or obey, For the government changed some ten times a day. At the hour of her birth some lucky star gave her Wit and beauty enough to have lasted for ever; But fortune, still froward when nature is kind, A narrow estate maliciously join'd To a very great genius and a generous mind. Her body was made of that superfine clay, Which is apt to be brittle for want of allay; And when, without show of outward decay, It began by degrees to molder away, Her soul, then too busy on some foreign affair, Of its own pretty dwelling took so little care, That the tenement fell for want of repair. Far be from hence both the fool and the knave, But let all who pretend to be witty or brave, Whether gen'rous friend or amorous slave, Contribute some tears to water her grave. On the Young Heiress of Lincoln's Inn Fields The dainty young heiress of Lincoln's Inn Fields, Brisk, beautiful, wealthy, and witty, To the power of love so unwillingly yields, That, 'tis fear'd, she'll unpeople the city. The sparks and the beaux all languish and die, Yet, after the conquest of many, One little good marksman that aims with one eye May wound her heart deeper than any. Pindaric Petition to the Lords in Council Humbly Sheweth, Should you order Tom Brown To be whip'd about town For a scurvy lampoon, Grave Southern and Crown, Their pens wou'd lay down. Even Durfey himself and such merry fellows That put their whole trust in tunes and trangdilloes May hang up their harps and themselves on the willows, For if poets are punish'd for libelling trash, John Dryden at sixty may yet fear the lash. No pension nor praise, Much birch without bays, These are not the right ways Our fancies to raise To the writing of plays, And prologues so witty, That jerk at the city, And now and then hit Some spark in the pit So hard and so pat 'Till he hides with his hat His monstrous cravat. The pulpit alone Can never preach down The fops of this town. Then pardon Tom Brown, And let him write on. But if you had rather convert the poor sinner, His foul, railing mouth may be stop'd with a dinner. Give him clothes to his back, some meat, and much drink, Then clap him close prisoner without pen and ink, And your petitioner shall never pray, write, nor think. On Mrs. Anne Roche when she Lost Sir John Daws Like a true Irish merlin that has lost her flight, Little Nancy sat mumping and sullen all night. Tho' the jackdaw escap'd her, the loss is not great; She may yet catch a woodcock, and that's better meat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI. Court and Town Four Letters in Verse between Dorset and Etherege A Letter from the Lord Buckhurst to Mr. George Etherege Dreaming last night on Mrs. Farley, My p? was up this morning early; And I was fain without my gown To rise in th'cold to get him down. Hard shift, alas, but yet a sure, Although it be no pleasing cure. Of old the fair Egyptian slattern, For luxury that had no pattern, To fortify her Roman swinger, Instead of nutmeg, mace and ginger, Did spice his bowels (as story tells) With warts of rocks and spawn of shells. It had been happy for her Grace, Had I been in the rascal's place; I, who do scorn that any stone Shou'd raise my pintle but my own, Had laid her down on every couch And sav'd her pearl and diamond brooch Until her hot-tail'd Majesty, Being happily reclaim'd by me From all her wild expensive ways, Had worn her gems on holidays. But since her c? has long done itching, Let us discourse of modern bitching. I must entreat you by this letter, To inquire for whores, the more the better. Hunger makes any man a glutton; If Roberts, Thomas, Mrs. Dutton, Or any other bawds of note, Inform of a fresh petticoat, Inquire, I pray, with friendly care, Where their respective lodgings are. Some do compare a man t'a bark— A pretty metaphor, pray mark— And with a long and tedious story, Will all the tackling lay before ye: The sails are hope, the masts desire, Till they the gentlest reader tire. But howsoe'er they keep a pudder, I'm sure the pintle is the rudder: The pow'rful rudder, which of force To town will shortly steer my course. And if you do not there provide A port where I may safely ride, Landing in haste, in some foul creek, 'Tis ten to one I spring a leak. Next, I must make it my request, If you have any interest, Or can be any means discover Some lamentable rhyming lover, Who shall in numbers harsh and vile, His mistress “Nymph” or “Goddess” style, Send all his labors down to me By the first opportunity. Or any Knights of your Round Table, To other scribblers formidable, Guilty themselves of the same crime, Dress nonsense up in ragged rhyme, As once a week they seldom fail, Inspir'd by love and gridiron ale. Or any paltry poetry, Tho' from the university, Who when the King and Queen were there, Did both their wit and learning spare, And have, I hope, endeavor'd since To make the world some recompense. Such damn'd fustian when you meet, Be not too rash or indiscreet, Tho' they can plead no just excuses, To put 'em to their proper uses— The fatal privy or the fire, Their nobler foe—at my desire Restrain your natural profuseness, And spare 'em tho' you have a looseness. —BUCKHURST. Mr. Etherege's Answer As crafty harlots use to shrink From lechers dozed with sleep and drink, When they intend to make up pack By filching sheets or shirt from back, So were you pleas'd to steal away From me, whilst on your bed I lay; But long you had not been departed When pinch'd with cold from thence I started; Where missing you I stamp'd and star'd, Like Bacon when he wak'd and heard His Brazen Head in vain had spoke, And saw it lie in pieces broke. Sighing, I to my chamber make, Where ev'ry limb was stiff as stake, Unless poor p?, which did feel Like slimy skin of new-stripped eel, Or pudding that mischance had got, And spent itself half in the pot. With care I cleans'd the sneaking varlet Which late had been in pool of harlot; But neither shirt nor water cou'd Remove the stench of lech'rous mud. The Queen of Love from sea did spring, Whence the best c?s still smell like ling. But sure this damn'd notorious bitch Was made o'th' foam of Jane Shore's ditch; Or else her c? could never stink Like pump that's foul, or nasty sink. When this was done, to bed I went, Where that whole day in sleep I spent; But the next morning, fresh and gay As citizen on holiday, I wander'd in the spacious Town, Amongst the bawds of best renown, Making enquiry far and near To find out fresh and wholesome gear. To Temple I a visit made— Temple, the beauty of her trade! The only bawd that ever I For want of whore could occupy. She made me friends with Mrs. Cuffley, Whom we indeed had us'd too roughly, For by a gentler way I found The nymph would f? under ten pound. So resty jades that scorn to stir, Tho' oft provok'd by whip and spur, By milder usage may be got To fall into their wonted trot. But what success I further had, And what discoveries good and bad I made by roving up and down, I'll tell you when you come to town. Further, I have obey'd your motion, Tho' much provok'd by pill and potion, And sent you down some paltry rhymes, The greatest grievance of our times, When such as Nature never made For poets daily do invade Wit's empire, both the stage and press— And what is worse, with good success. —ETHEREGE. Another Letter by the Lord Buckhurst to Mr. Etherege If I can guess the Devil choke me What horrid fury could provoke thee To use thy railing, scurrilous wit 'Gainst p? and c? the source of it For what but p? and c? do's raise Our thoughts to songs and roundelays, Enables us to anagrams And other amorous flim flams? Then we write plays and so proceed To bays, the poets' sacred weed. Hast thou no respect for God Priapus? That ancient story should not 'scape us. Priapus was a Roman God, But in plain English, p? and cod. Who pleas'd their sisters, wives, and daughters, Guarded their pippins and pomwaters; For at the orchard's utmost entry This mighty deity stood sentry, Invested in a tatter'd blanket, To scare the magpies from their banquet. But this may serve to show we trample On rule and method by example Of modern writers, who to snap at all, Will talk of Caesar in the Capitol, Of Cynthia's beams and Sol's bright ray, Known foe to buttermilk and whey, Which softens wax and hardens clay. All this without the least connection, Which to say truth's enough to vex one; But farewell all poetic dizziness, And now to come unto the business. Tell the bright nymph how sad and pensively, Ever since we us'd her so offensively In dismal shades, with arms across I sit lamenting of my loss. To Echo I her name commend, Who has it now at her tongue's end, And parrot-like repeats the same; For should you talk of Tamberlaine, Cuffley! she cries at the same time (Though the last accent does not rhyme)— Far more than Echo e'er did yet For Phyllis or bright Amoret. With penknife keen of moderate size, As bright and piercing as her eyes, (A glitt'ring weapon, which would scorn To pare a nail or cut a corn) Upon the trees of smoothest bark I carve her name or else her mark, Which commonly's a bleeding heart, A weeping eye, or flaming dart. Here on a beech, like am'rous sot, I sometimes carve a true-love's knot. There a tall oak her name do's wear, In a large spreading character. I chose the fairest and the best Of all the grove: among the rest I carv'd it on a lofty pine, Who wept a pint of turpentine; Such was the terror of her name, By the report of evil fame, Who, tired with immoderate flight, Had lodg'd upon its boughs all night. The wary tree, who fear'd a clap, And knew the virtue of its sap, Dropped balsam into ev'ry wound And in an hour's time was sound. But you are unacquainted yet With half the power of Amoret; For she can drink as well as swive, Her growing empire still must thrive. Our hearts weak forts we must resign When beauty does its forces join With man's strong enemy, good wine. This I was told by my Lord O'Brien, A man whose words I much rely on: He kept touch and came down hither When you were scar'd by the foul weather. But if thou wouldst forgiven be, Say that a c? detained thee; C?! whose strong charms the world bewitches, The joy of kings! the beggar's riches! The courtier's business! statesman's leisure! The tired tinker's ease and pleasure! Of which, alas, I've leave to prate, But oh, the rigor of my fate! For want of bouncing bona-roba, Lasciva est nobis pagina vita proba. For that rhyme I was fain to fumble; When Pegasus begins to stumble, 'Tis time to rest, your very humble. —BUCKHURST. Mr. Etherege's Answer So soft and am'rously you write Of c? and p?, the c?'s delight, That were I still in lantern sweating, Swallowing of bolus or a-spitting, I should forgive each injury The pocky whores have offer'd me, And only of my fate complain Because I must from c? abstain— The powerful c?, whose very name Kindles in me an amorous flame! Begins to make my pintle rise And long again to fight love's prize, Forgetful of those many scars Which he has gotten in those wars. This shows love's chiefest magic lies In women's c?, not in their eyes: There Cupid does his revels keep, There lovers all their sorrows steep; For having once but tasted that, Their miseries are quite forgot. This may suffice to let you know That I to c? am not a foe, Though you are pleas'd to think me so; 'Tis strange his zeal should be in suspicion Who dies a martyr for's religion. But now to give you an account Of Cuffley, that Whore paramount! Cuffley, whose beauty warms the age, And fills our youth with love and rage; Who like fierce wolves pursue the game, While secretly the lecherous dame With some choice gallant takes her flight, And in a corner f? all night. Then the next morning we all hunt To find whose fingers smell of c?, With jealousy and envy mov'd Against the man that was belov'd. Whilst you to Echo teach her name, Thus it becomes the voice of fame In every corner of the town. We here proclaim her high renown Whilst you within some neighb'ring grove Indite the story of your love, And with your penknife keen and bright On stately trees your passion write, So that each nymph that passes through Must envy her and pity you. We at the Fleece or at the Bear, With good case knife, well whet on stair, (A gentle weapon, made to feed Mankind and not to let him bleed) A thousand am'rous fancies scrape. There's not a pewter dish can 'scape Without her name or arms, which are The same that love himself does bear. Here one, to show you love's no glutton, I'th' midst of supper leaves his mutton, And on his greasy plate, with care, Carves the bright image of the fair. Another, though a drunken sot, Neglects his wine and on the pot A band of naked Cupids draws, With p? no bigger than wheat straws. Then on a nasty candlestick One figures love's hieroglyphic, A couchant c? and rampant p?. And that the sight may more inflame, The lookers-on subscribe her name: Cuffley! her sex's pride and shame. There's not a man but does discover By some such action he's her lover. But now 'tis time to give her over, And let your Lordship know you are The mistress that employs our care. Your absence makes us melancholy, Nor drink nor c? can make us jolly, Unless we've you within our arms, In whom there dwells diviner charms. Then quit with speed your pensive grove And here in town pursue your love; Where at your coming you shall find Your servants glad, your mistress kind, All things devoted to your mind; With your very Humble Servant.—ETHEREGE. The Duel of the Crabs In Milford Lane near to St. Clement's steeple There liv'd a nymph kind to all Christian people. A nymph she was whose comely mien and stature, Whose height of eloquence and every feature Struck through the hearts of city and of Whitehall, And when they pleas'd to court her, did 'em right all. Under her beauteous bosom there did lie A belly smooth as any ivory. Yet nature to declare her various art Had plac'd a tuft in one convenient part; No park with smoothest lawn or highest wood Could e'er compare with this admir'd abode. Here all the youth of England did repair To take their pleasure and to ease their care. Here the distressed lover that had borne His haughty mistress' anger and her scorn Came for relief, and in this pleasant shade Forgot the former and this nymph obey'd. But yet what corner of the world is found, Where pain our pleasure does not still surround? One would have thought that in this shady grove Nought could have dwelt but quiet, peace, and love. But Heaven directed otherwise, for here In midst of plenty bloody wars appear: The gods will frown wherever they do smile; The crocodile infests the fertile Nile. Lions and tigers on the Lybian plains Forbid all pleasures to the fearful swains; Wild beasts in forests do the hunters fright: They fear their ruin 'midst of their delight. Thus in the shade of this dark, silent bower Strength strives with strength, and power vies with power. Two mighty monsters did this wood infest, And struck such awe and terror in the rest That no Sicilian tyrant e'er could boast He e'er with greater vigor rul'd the roast. Each had his empire, which he kept in awe, Was by his will obey'd, allow'd no law. Nature so well divided had their states, Nought but ambition could have chang'd their fates: For 'twixt their empires stood a briny lake, Deep as the poets do the centre make; But dire ambition does admit no bounds— There are no limits to aspiring crowns. The Spaniard by his Europe conquests bold, Sail'd o'er the ocean for the Indian gold; The Carthaginian hero did not stay Because he met vast mountains in his way. He pass'd the Alps like molehills; such a mind As thinks on conquest will be unconfin'd. Both with these haughty thoughts one course do bend To try if this vast lake had any end; Where finding countries yet without a name, They might by conquest get eternal fame. After long marches, both their armies tired, At length they find the place so much desired, Where in a little time each does descry The glimpse of an approaching enemy. Each at the sight with equal pleasure move, As we should do in well rewarded love: Bloodthirsty souls, whose only perfect joy Consists in what their fury can destroy. And now both armies do prepare to fight, And each the other unto war incite; In vain, alas, for all their force and strength Was quite consumed by their marches' length; But the great chiefs, impatient of delay, Resolve by single fifht to try the day. Each does the other with contempt defy, Resolve by single fight to try the day. Both armies are commanded to withdraw In expectation who should give 'em law; While the amaz'd spectators full of care, Hope for a better, or worse tyrant fear. And now these princes meet, now they engage With all their chiefest strength and highest rage. Now with their instruments of wrath they push As hills in earthquakes on each other rush; Where their militia lies is still in doubt, Whether like elephants upon their snout, Or if upon their heads vast horns they wore, Or if they fought with tusks like fierce wild boar. Some Greshamites perhaps with help of glass And poring long upon't may chance to guess, But no tradition has inform'd our age What were their chiefest instruments of rage. With small or no advantage they proceed; Both are much bruised and their wounds do bleed; Both keep their anger, both do loose their force; Both get the better, neither gets the worse. Justice herself might put into each scale One of these princes and see neither fall. Spurr'd on by fury, now they both provide To let one grapple this great cause decide; Joining, they strive, and such resistance make Both fall together in the briny lake, Where from the troubles of a tottering crown, Each mighty monarch is laid gently down. Both armies at this sight amazed stand In doubt: who shall obey, who shall command; In this extremity they both agree A commonwealth their government shall be. Colon As Colon drove his sheep along By Whitehall, there was such a throng Of early coaches at the gate The silly swain was forc'd to wait. Chance threw him on Sir Edward Sutton, A jolly knight that rhymes to mutton: “Colon,” said he, “this is the day, For which poor England long did pray; The day that sets our Monarch free From butter'd buns and slavery. This hour from French intrigues, 'tis said, He'll clear his Council and his bed. Portsmouth, he now vouchsafes to know, Was the cast whore of Count de Sault. Each night with her dear was as sessions O'th' House, and fuller of petitions, Which drain'd him 'till he was not able To keep his Council or a table, So that whitestaves, grooms, and pages Live alike upon board wages. She must retire and sell her place; Buyers, you see, flock in apace.” Silence i'th' Court being once proclaim'd, Up stepp'd fair Richmond once so fam'd: She offer'd much but was refus'd, And of miscarriages accus'd. They said a c? so us'd to puke Could never bear a booby duke; That Mulgrave, Williers, and Jack How For one salt duchess were enow. Nor would his Majesty accept her At thirty, who at eighteen left her: She blush'd and modestly withdrew. Next Middleton appear'd in view, Who straight was told of Montagu; Of baits from Hyde, of clothes from France, Of armpits, toes and suffisance; At which the Court set up a laughter: And then she pleaded for her daughter, A buxom lass fit for the place, (Were not her father in disgrace) Whose monstrous chin 'twas thought begun Her pretty face to overrun, Besides some strange, incestuous stories Of Harvey and her long clitoris. With these exceptions she's dismiss'd, And Morland fair enters the list: Husband in hand most decently, And begs at any rate to buy. She offer'd jewels of great price, And dear Sir Samuel's next device, Whether it be a pump or table, Glass house or any other bauble: But she was told she had been tri'd, And for good reasons laid aside. Next in stepp'd pretty Lady Grey, Offer'd her lord should nothing say 'Gainst the next treasurer's accus'd, So her pretense were not refus'd: Rowley enrag'd bid her be gone, And play her game out with his son; Or if she lik'd an aged carcass, From Lucy get the noble Marquess. Shrewsbury offer'd for the place, All she had gotten from his Grace; She knew his ways and could comply With all decays of lechery; Had often lick'd his amorous scepter Until the jaded stallion leap't her; But long ago she had the mishap To give the King Dick Talbot's clap; Though for her all was said that can be, By her lean drudge, the Earl of Danby. She was dismiss'd with scorn and told Where a tall page was to be sold. Then in came dowdy Mazarin, That foreign, antiquated quean, Who soon was told the King no more Would deal with an intriguing whore; That she already had about her Too good an equipage de foutre; Nor was our monarch such a cully To bear a Moor, and swingeing bully. Her Grace at this rebuke look'd blank, And sneak'd away to villain Frank. Fair Lichfield too her claim put in. 'Twas urg'd she was too near akin; She modestly reply'd, “No more Akin than Sussex was before.” Besides she'd often heard her mother Call her the daughter of another; She did not drivel and had sense, To which all his had no pretence. Yet for the present she's put off, And told she was not whore enough. Loftus smil'd at that exception, Doubting not of good reception; Put in her claim, vowing she'd steal All that her husband won of Neale: To buy the place all he should get, By his long suit with Mr. Pitt; But from Goliath's size of Gath, Down to the pitch of little Wroth, The Court was told she'd lain with all The roaring roisterers of Whitehall; For which Old Rowley, lest she'd grudge, Gave her the making of a judge. She bow'd and straight bought her six grays, To haunt the Court, the park, and plays. In stepp'd stately Cary Fraser, Straight the whole room began to praise her; As fine as hands and paint could make her, She vow'd the King or jail must take her. Rowley repli'd, he was retrenching And would no more of costly wenching; That she was proud and went too gaudy, Nor could she swear, drink, and talk bawdy— Virtues more requisite for that place Than wit, or youth, or a good face. Cleveland offered down a million, But she was soon told of Chastillon; At that name straight she fell a-weeping And swore she was undone with keeping; That Jermyn, Churchill had so drain'd her She could not live on the remainder. The Court said there was no record Of any to that place restor'd, Nor ought the King at these years venture, When his prime could not content her. Young Lady Jones stepp'd up and urg'd She'd give the deed her father forg'd; But she was told her family Was tainted with Presbytery. She said her mother with clean heart And hands had lately done her part In bringing Mazarin to bed, Nor was't her fault the babe was dead. Her sister, too, as all men know, Had f? as high and married low As Belasyse, or any punk Of late with royal seed made drunk. For her Rowley own'd his passion, But said he stood by declaration Engaged, no matter of great weight To pass 'till after some debate In his great Council. So they adjourn'd, And Colon to his flocks return'd, Swearing there were at every fair Blither girls than any there. A Faithful Catalogue of our Most Eminent Ninnies ? Quos Omnes Vicini oderunt, noti, pueri atque puellae. Horace, Sat. I. i. 84–85. Curs'd be those dull, unpointed, doggerel rhymes, Whose harmless rage has lash'd our impious times. Rise thou, my muse, and with the sharpest thorn, Instead of peaceful bays, my brows adorn; Inspir'd with just disdain and mortal hate, Who long have been my plague shall feel thy weight. I scorn a giddy and unsafe applause: But this, ye Gods, is fighting in your cause. Let Sodom speak and let Gomorrah tell, If their curs'd walls deserv'd their flames so well. Go on, my muse, and with bold voice proclaim The vicious lives and long detested fame Of scoundrel lords and their lewd wives' amours, Pimp statesmen, bug'ring priests, court bawds, and whores; Exalted vice its own vile name does sound, To climes remote, and distant shores renown'd. Thy strumpets, Charles, have 'scap'd no nation's ear; Cleveland the van, and Portsmouth led the rear: A brace of cherubs, of as vile a breed, As ever was produc'd of human seed. To all but thee the punks were ever kind, Free as loose air and gen'rous as the wind. Both steer'd thy p? and the nation's helm, And both betray'd thy p? and thy realm. Oh Barbara! thy execrable name Is sure embalm'd with everlasting shame. Could not that num'rous host thy lust suffice, Which in lascivious shoals ador'd thy eyes; When their bright beams were through our orb display'd, And kings each morn their Persian homage paid? Now Churchill! Dover! see how they are sunk Into her loathsome, sapless, aged trunk. And yet remains her c?'s insatiate itch, And there's a devil yet can hug the witch. Pardon me, Bab, if I mistake his race, Which is infernal sure, for tho' he has No cloven foot, he has a cloven face. Oh sacred James! may thy dread noddle be As free from danger, as from wit 'tis free; But if that good and gracious Monarch's charms Could ne'er confine one woman to his arms, What strange mysterious spell, what strong defence, Can guard that front which has not half his sense? Poor Sedley's fall ev'n her own sex deplore, Who with so small temptation turn'd thy whore. But Grafton bravely does revenge her fate, And says thou court'st her thirty years too late; She scorns such dwindles; her capacious a? Is fitter for thy scepter than thy t?. Old Dover, Shrewsbury, and Mordaunt know Why in that stately frame she lies so low; And who but her dull blockhead would have found Her window's small descent on rising ground? Thro' the large sash they pass, like Jove of old, To her attendant bawd, in show'rs of gold. Mordaunt, that insolent, ill-natur'd bear, From the close grotto, when no danger's near, Mounts like a rampant stag, and ruts his dear. But when by dire mischance the harmless maid In the dark closet, with loud shrieks, betray'd The naked lecher, what a woful grief It was! Th'adult'ress flew to his relief, And sav'd his being murder'd for a thief. Defenceless limbs the well-arm'd host assail'd; Scarce her own pray're with her own slaves prevail'd. Though well prepar'd for flight he mourn'd his weight And begg'd Actaeon's change to 'scape Actaeon's fate; But wing'd with fear, tho' untransform'd, he bounds, And swift as hinds outstrips the yelling hounds. Beware adulterers, betimes beware, You fall not in the same unhappy snare: From Norfolk's ruin, and his narrow 'scape, Swive on contented with a willing rape, On a strong chair, soft couch, or side of bed, Which never does surprising dangers dread. Let no such harlots lead your steps astray; Her c? will mount in open day, And from St. James's to the land of Thule, There's not a whore who spends so like a mule. Yet who, to tell the truth, cou'd less have swiv'd Whose c? was from such lecherous states deriv'd? For 'twas the custom of her ancient race To f? with any fool in any place. And yet her blund'ring dolt deserves a worse; Could man be plagu'd with a severer curse? A meeter couple never sure were hatch'd; Some marry'd are indeed, but they are match'd. The sodomite complains of too much room, And for an a? disdains her spacious womb. A common bulker is his chief delight, And they in conscience ought to do him right, And as c? spends, a? when well pleas'd shou'd shite. But seeing they are lawful man and wife, Why should the fool and drazel live in strife, While they both lead the same lascivious life? Or why should he to Megg's or Southcott's roam, When he may find as great a whore at home? Mulgrave, who all his summons to big war Safely commits to his wise Prince's care, Lords it o'er all mankind, and is the first By woman hated and by man accurs'd. Well has his staff a double use supply'd, At once upheld his body and his pride. How haughtily he cries: “Page, fetch a whore; Damn her, she's ugly; rascal, fetch me more; Bring in that black-ey'd wench; woman, come near; Rot you, you draggled bitch, what is't you fear?” Trembling she comes, and with as little flame, As he for the dear part from whence he came. But by the help of an assisting thumb Squeezes his chitterling into her bum; And if it prove a straight, well-spincter'd a?, Perhaps it rears a little his feeble t?. But if one drop of vital juice it shed, Help him, good Jove, for both sides then are dead. Thine, crafty Seymour, was a good design; For sure his issue ne'er will injure thine: But thou thy self must needs confess that she Does justly curse thy politics and thee. Her noble Protestant has got a flail, Young, large, and fit to feague her briny tail; But now, poor wretch, she lies as she would burst, Sometimes with brandy, and sometimes with lust. Tho' prime as goats, she courts in vain her drone: The frigid he, and she the torrid zone. Both friend and foe he with vast ruin mauls, Who at first thrust before, both sexes falls. Had I, Oh! had I his transcendent verse, In his own lofty strains I would rehearse That deep intrigue, when he the Princess woo'd, But lov'd adult'ry more than royal blood. Young Ossory, who lov'd the haughty peer, Her mother's darling sins could best declare. But to her memory we must be just; 'Tis sacrilege to rob such beauteous dust. O Wharton, Wharton! what a wretched tool Is a dull wit, when made a woman's fool? Thy rammish spendthrift buttocks, 'tis well known, Her nauseous bait has made thee swallow down, Tho' mumbled and spit out by half the town. How well, my honest Lexington, she knows The many mansions in thy f?ing house! How often prais'd thy dear curvetting t?, Which thou rid'st curb'd, like an unruly horse! That crooked martyr, which most c? would flout, Turns her lascivious matrix inside out. Pleas'd with the novelty, she freely spends, And turns and winds which way soe'er it bends. How big with joy she went with thee to church, When thou, false varlet, left her in the lurch! Ev'n Elliot, who refus'd none before, Scorn'd to pronounce the banns with such a whore. To Pancras, Tom, there such as she resort (That mother church too does all sinners court). As she has been thy strumpet all her life, 'Tis time to make her now thy lawful wife, That Bulkeley's spouse may pride it in the box, With face and c? all martyr'd with the pox. In some deep sawpit both their noddles hide, For 'tis hard guessing which has the best bride. Ah Tom! thy brother like a prudent man, Has chosen the much better harridan; She, a good-natur'd candid devil, shows Him all the bawding, jilting tricks she knows. Thy rook some trivial cheats her blockhead learns, While he the master hocus he'er discerns. To pox and plague, oh! may she subject be, As she's from childbed pain and peril free: Her actual sins invalidate the first; With ease she teems and brings forth unaccurst. To thee, Lucina, she need never call; Like ripen'd fruit, her mellow bastards fall; And what with needless labor I disclose, Her well-stretched c? and rivell'd belly shows. Whoever, like Charles Dering, scorns disgrace, Can never want, altho' he lose his place: That toothless murd'rer, to his just reproach, Pimps for his sister to maintain a coach, And let what will the church or state befall, One fulsome crafty whore maintains 'em all. Scarsdale, tho' loath'd, still the fair sex adores, And has a regiment of horse and whores. Amidst the common rout of early duns For mustard, soap, milk, small coal, swords, and guns, Two rev'rend officers (more highly born) Wait on his stinking levee ev'ry morn, And in full pomp his palace gates adorn. But which is most in vogue is hard to tell, The public bawd or private sentinel; That blubber'd oaf, for two dull dribbling bouts, Maintains two bastards made of Jenny's clouts. E'er it could fetch, 'twas like pox'd Eland spoil'd, Yet it can't touch a wench, but she's with child; But who can think that pestilential breath Should raise up life that always blasts with death? 'Tis strange Kildare, that refin'd beau garcon, Was never yet at the Bell Savage shown, For he's a true and wonderful baboon. It therefore wisely was at first design'd He ne'er should like to propagate his kind, But the dull-venom'd draught in vain employ'd, Like the false serpent's, was itself destroy'd. With foul corruption sure he first was fed, And by equivocal generation bred. An honest solan goose, compar'd to him, Is a fine creature and of more esteem. No learn'd philosophers need strive to know Whether his soul's ex traduce or no. He has none yet, nor never will, I fear: No soul of sense would ever enter there. Tho' Talbot, that young sodomite, they say With t? and carrot well inlarg'd the way; With painfull look he grins, as if the fool Were always squeezing for a costive stool: I wonder he dares speak, for fear we firk His lazy bones and make the monkey work. Swive on, my fair adult'ress, you do well, For who would not loathe him much more than Hell? F? with some true wild Irish fool, or brim With savage boars rather than lie with him. If aged Devonshire has left the trade And had enough of costly masquerade, With renew'd flames your old amour pursue, Now Rochester has nothing else to do. Well done, old Hyde, we all thy choice adore, She is the younger and much better whore. But Hales has sure, to his eternal curse, Left his own strumpet and espous'd a worse. That blazing star still rises with the sun, And will, I hope, whene'er it sets, go down. St. Peter ne'er deny'd his Lord but thrice, But good St. Edward scorns to be so nice; He, ev'ry mass, abjures what he before On tests and sacraments so often swore. His mother church will have a special son, Of him, by whom his father was undone. He turn'd, because on bread alone he'd dine, And make the wafer save his bread and wine. Mammon's the God he'll worship any way, And keeps conviction ready to a day. Forbid it, Heav'n, I e'er should live to see Our pious Monarch's gorgeous chapel be Filled with such miscreant proselytes as he. Miserere Domine! Ave Maria! Poor Father Dover has got a gonorrhea. Was e'er, dread James, so much affection shown? He'd save thy soul, but cares not for his own. How Sedley prays that old adult'rous fop May find it a Carnegan-swingeing clap! And sure 'twill in the bones and marrow stick, And must be damnable to soul and p?, The pocky jade was a damn'd heretick. “God's Wounds, God's Blood! our family's beshit,” Quoth Winchester, “but I'll be drunk at night.” Unhappy maid! who man has never known, And yet with perilous pangs brought forth a son! Rejoice, ye slavish tribe of later Jews; Sound in your synagogues the blessed news: A new messiah is at last arriv'd From an unspotted womb that ne'er was swiv'd. Our chiro-medico Didymus nothing smelt, 'Till he the sprawling bantling heard and felt. And now it surely cannot be deny'd By him who cur'd the King of what he dy'd. How Herbert boasts that his wise king's-head crew Foretold the dismal times we all should rue. Curs'd be the screech owls! that rebellious crowd Presag'd, indeed, Rome's swift approach, as loud, As wise Cassandra's boding voice of old, The wretched fate of ancient Rome foretold. But why is he against the bringing in Any religion that indulges sin? He who his other charges can retrench To save ten guineas for a handsome wench; Or be content to part with twenty pound, If Mrs. Wright insure her being sound. That idiot thinks the tawdry harlot's glad To serve him now for favors she has had. But who, dear Harry, ever heard before Of gratitude in any common whore? She mounts the price and goes half snack herself, And well knows how to cully such an elf. Poor Jenny I must needs much more applaud, A better whore, and truer friend and bawd. Like the French King, he all his conquests buys, And pow'rful guineas still subdue their eyes. How his smug little black-ey'd harlot gaz'd On's broad gold, and fine apartments prais'd! But f?'d, not trusting to the miser's truth, Like Joseph's sacks, with money in her mouth; Sometimes he'll venture for himself to trade, With awkward grace, at balls and masquerade. But what was the proud coxcomb e'er the near, Unless he got my Lady Gerard there? Her qualities to all the world are known, Fair as his kin, and honest as her own. She makes her brothel worse than common stews, And loves to swive in her own tribe, like Jews: Incest with nearest blood, adult'ry, all Her darling sins, we may well deadly call. Whate'er in times of yore she may have been, Her lust has now parch'd up her rivell'd skin. Thou town of Edmonton, I charge, declare What she and Wolseley did so often there. That scribbling fool, who writes to her in metre, And only speaks his songs to make 'em sweeter: Great Virgil's true reverse in sense and fate, For what another writ procur'd his hate. To be but thought a wit, he lost his place; And yet to show he is not of that race, Will write himself, and add to his disgrace. His Valentinian's learned preface shines, Like Memphis' siege or Bulloigne's radiant lines. Among the muses all his time he spends, And his whole study tow'rds Parnassus bends: Yet if for his, one handsome thought be shown, Stop the dull thief—I'll swear 'tis not his own. Satire's his joy, but if he don't improve, Give me his hatred, let her take his love. That fop she, Herbert, more than thee admires; He oftener quenches her lascivious fires. In vain poor Harry, with ridic'lous joy, Shews her and ev'ry fool his hopeful boy. His city songstress says he keeps such pother She's sure he'll ne'er be able to get another. Join then, propitious stars, their widow'd store, And make them happy, as they were before; That is, may the decay'd incestuous punk Swill like his spouse, and he, like hers, die drunk. Why, Houghton, has the good old Queen the grace, To see thy bearlike mien and baboon face? Her Court, the gods be prais'd, has long been free From Irish prigs and such dull sots as thee. The wakeful gen'ral, conscious of thy charms, Dreads thine, as much as Monmouth's fierce alarms. Yet sure there is a greater ditch between A greasy Whiggish dolt and Charles's Queen. There is, and Houghton soars not yet so high, His ogling pigsnies gloat on Lady Di. That gudgeon on soft baits will only bite, For easy conquests are his sole delight. And none can say but that his judgment's good, For all the Kirkes are made of flesh and blood. Vernon, the glory of that lustful tribe, Scorns to be meanly purchas'd with a bribe: To fame and honor hates to be a slave, But freely gives what nature freely gave. Like heirs to crowns with sure credentials born, Her hasty bastards private entries scorn; In midst of courts and in the midst of day, With little peril force their easy way. But Woodford is, methinks, a better seat, And for distended wems a safe retreat. 'Twas well advised old Kirk no dangers fear'd; No groans, nor yelling cries, can there be heard: In this lewd town and these censorious times, Where ev'ry whore rails at each other's crimes, Fair Theodosia! thy romantic name Had sure been blasted with eternal shame: But thy wise strategems so well were laid, I'd almost swear thou art a very maid. Go on, and scorn our common swiving rules; Let Warcup make th'incestuous uncles fools: While prudence pimps, and such a foe combines, Impregnate more and more thy seedy loins; Thou still art safe, tho' thy large womb should bear Like hers, who teem'd for ev'ry day o'th' year. Proud Oxford justly thinks her Dutch-built shape A little too unwieldy for a rape. Yet being conscious it will tumble down, At first assault surrenders up the town. But no kind conqueror has yet thought fit To make it his belov'd imperial seat. That batter'd fort, which they with ease deceive, Pillag'd and sack'd, to the next foe they leave. And haughty Di in just revenge will lig, Altho' she starve, with any senseless Whig; Not that to any principle she's firm, But is debauch'd by damn'd seducing sperm. Sidney well knew the banning hour, when seven, God's Wounds! throws out, or else God's Blood! eleven: When her decrepit spendthrift, troopless rook, Is meek as Moses hid in fire and smoke. Our Sacred Writ does learnedly relate, For one poor babe two mothers hot debate: But our two doughty heroes, I am told, Which is the truest father, fiercely scold. Both claims seem just and great, but gen'rous Hales, Who always is on the right side, prevails. He will not only save his life, but soul; So poor Phil Kirke is fubb'd off for a fool. But 'tis all one; Sir Courtly Nice does swear He'll go to Mrs. Grace of Exeter. But why to Ireland, Braithwaite? Will that clime, Dost thou imagine, make an easy time? Ungratefully indeed thou did'st requite The skilful goddess of the silent night, By whose kind help thou wast so oft before Deliver'd safely on thy native shore. Thy belly shin'd, and an unusual load Made thee believe Kirke's shoulder's were too broad. And thou'dst be sure we should not hear thee roar: And if poor tuzzy muzzy should be tore, Wisely resolv'd Ned should ne'er see it more: But since all's well, return, that we may laugh At Irish c?s, which in all climes are safe. Justly, false Monmouth, did thy lord declare, Thou should'st not in his crown nor empire share. Indeed, dear Limp, it was a just design, Seeing he had so small a share of thine. Brave Feversham, that thund'ring son of arms, With pow'rful magic conquer'd both your charms. Virtue, thy weak lieutenant, ran away, Just like that cursed miscreant, coward Gray; And as poor James from his new subjects did, At last from thy fair breast the gen'ral fled. His conversation, wit, and parts, and mien Deserv'd, he thought, at least a widow'd queen. Nor wert thou sorry, since most seeds are found To flourish better when we change the ground. He, struck in years and spent in toils and war, Could please thee less than did the strong Dunbar: Ne'er was a truer stallion; to his cost, He, as he was most able, lov'd thee most. But politic Monmouth thought it too much grace For one t'enjoy too long so great a place. Cornwallis next succeeds the lovely train, And round his neck displays a captive's chain: He, greater fool than any of the rest, They say, will marry with the trimming beast; Which if he does, Oh! may his blood be shed On that high throne where her last traytor bled. Mysterious pow'rs! what wond'rous influence Governs, ye ruling stars, poor mortal's sense? What unknown motive our dread King persuades, To make lewd Ogle mother of the maids. The gracious Prince had sure much wiser been, Had he made Stamford tutress to the Queen; And then, perhaps, her chaste instructions wou'd Have sav'd a world of unbegotten blood. But pious James, with parts profound endu'd, Will none prefer but whom he knows are lewd. Sophia, Belasyse and all the court breed, Ladies of wond'rous honor are indeed. Ye scoundrel nymphs, whom rags and scabs adorn, Than that small paltry whore more highly born, If you are wise, apply yourselves betimes: None highly merit now but by their crimes. And the King does whate'er he's bid by Grimes. Which made the wiser choice is now our strife, Hoyle his he-mistress or the Prince his wife: Those traders sure will be belov'd as well As all the dainty, tender birds they sell. The learned advocate, that rugged stump Of old Nol's honor, always lov'd the Rump; And 'tis no miracle, since all the Hoyles Were giv'n, they say, to raise intestine broils. But seeing, to the upright juror's praise, We are return'd to Ignoramus days, The lawyer swears he greater hazard runs, Who f? one daughter than a hundred sons. Prepost'rous fate! while poor Miss Jenny bawds, Each foreign fop her mother's charms applauds. Autumnal whore! to ev'ry nation known! A curse to them and scandal to her own. Forgive me, chaster Hinton, if I name Her stinking toes with thine of sweeter fame. Thou wond'rous pocky art and wond'rous poor, But as she's richer, she's a greater whore. What with her breath, her armpits, and her feet, Ten civet cats can hardly make her sweet. From all the corners of our noisome town, The filth of ev'ry brute ran freely down To that insatiate strumpet's common shore, 'Till it broke out and poison'd her all o'er. Poor Buckingham in unsuccessful verse And terms too mild did her lewd crimes rehearse: Bold is the man that ventures such a flight; Her life's a satire, which no pen can write: And therefore cursed may she ever be, As when old Hyde was catch'd with rem in re. Caetera desunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII. Translation and Paraphrase Madam Maintenon's Advice to the French King. Paraphrase on the French In gray-hair'd Celia's wither'd arms As mighty Lewis lay, She cry'd, “If I have any charms, My dearest, let's away. “For you, my love, is all my fear; Hark! how the drums do rattle! Alas, Sir, what shou'd you do here In dreadful day of battle? “Let little Orange stay and fight, For danger's his diversion; The wise will think you in the right, Not to expose your person. “Nor vex your thoughts how to repair The ruins of your glory: You ought to leave so mean a care To those who pen your story. “Are not Boileau and Corneille paid For panegyric writing? They know how heroes may be made Without the help of fighting. “When foes too saucily approach, 'Tis best to leave them fairly: Put six good horses to your coach And carry me to Marly. “Let Boufflers, to secure your fame, Go take some town, or buy it, Whilst you, great Sir, at Notre Dame Te Deum sing in quiet.” The Innocent Conjugates or The Maiden Bridegroom and Virgin Bride Inflam'd by love and led by blind desires, The man pursues, the bashful maid retires. He hopes for pleasure, but she fears the pain; His love but ignorance is, her fears more vain: Whene'er he tastes those joys so priz'd before, He'll love no longer, and she'll fear no more. A Rodomontade on his Cruel Mistress Seek not to know a woman, for she's worse Than all ingredients cramm'd into a curse; Were she but ugly, peevish, proud, a whore, Perjur'd or painted, so she where no more, I could forgive her and connive at this, Adjudging still she but a woman is. But she is worse and may in time forestall The devil and be the damning of us all.</field>
