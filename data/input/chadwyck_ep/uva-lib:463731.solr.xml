      <field name="fulltext">Twelue rules of Iohn Picus Earle of Mirandula, partely exciting, partely directing a man in spiritual bataile. [The .i. rule.] If we refuse the way of vertue for that it is pa?ful for the like cause oughte wee to refuse the way of sin Whoso to vertue estemeth hard the way, Because we must haue warre continuall Against the worlde, the fleshe, the deuill that aye Enforce themselfe to make vs bonde and thrall, Let him remember, that chese what way he shall. Euen after the worlde, yet must he nede sustain Sorowe, aduersitee, labour, grief, and payne. The .ii. rule. Thinke in this wretched worldes besy wo, The battaile more sharpe, and lenger is ywis, with more labour and lesse fruite also, In whiche the ende of labour: labour is: And when the worlde hath left vs after this Uoide of all vertue: the rewarde when we die Is nought but fire and paine perpetually. The .iii. rule. Consider well, that foly it is and vaine To looke for heauen with pleasure and delight, Sith Christ our lorde and soueraine captayne Ascended neuer but by manly fight, And bitter passion: then wer it no right, Matthew. 10.That any seruaunt, ye will your selfe recorde, Shoulde stande in better condicion than his lorde. The .iiii. rule. Thinke howe that we not onely shoulde not grudge, But eke be glad and ioyfull of this fight, And longe therefore, although we could not iudge Howe that thereby redounde vnto vs might Any profite, but onely for delight, To be conformed and like in some behauiour, To Iesu Christ our blessed lorde and sauiour. As often as thou dost warre and striue, By the resistence of any sinfull mocion, Against any of thy sensuall wittes fiue, Cast in thy minde as oft with good deuocion, Howe thou resemblest Christ, as with sowre pocion Mat, 27. Mark. 15. Iohn. 19.If thou paine thy tast: remember there withall, How Christ for thee tasted eisill and gall. If thou withdrawe thine handes, and forbere, The rauen of anyething: remember than, How his innocent handes nailed were, If thou be tempt with pride: thinke how that whan Phil. 2.He was in forme of God: yet of a bond man, He toke the shape and humbled himself for thee To the most odious and vyle death of a tree. Consider when thou art moued to be wroth, He who that was god, and of all men the best, Seyng himself scorned and scourged both, Mark. 10. Luke, 18. Iohn. 19.And as a thefe betwene two theues threst, With all rebuke and shame: yet from his brest Came neuer signe of wrath or of disdain, But paciently endured all the pain. Thus euery snare and engine of the deuill If thou this wise peruse them by and by, There can be none so cursed or so euill, But to some vertue thou mayst it apply, For oft thou shalt, resisting valiauntly, The fendes might and sotle fiery darte: Our sauiour Christ resemble in some part. The .v. rule. Remember wel, that we in no wise must, Neither in the foresaid esperitual armour, Nor any other remedy put our trust: But onely in the vertue strength of our sauiour, For he it is, by whose mighty powre, The worlde was vainquished and his prince cast out, whiche raygned before in all the earth about. In him let vs trust to ouercome all euill, In him let vs put our hope and confidence, To subdue the fleshe and maister the deuil, To him be al honour and lowly reuerence: Oft should we require with al our diligence, with praier, with teares, and lamentable plaintes. The aide of his grace and his holy saintes. The .vi. rule. One sinne vainquished loke thou not tary, But lye in awayte for an other euery houre, 1. Peter. 5.For as a woode Lion the fende our aduersarie, Runneth about, seking whom he may deuoure, wherefore continually vpon thy towre Lest he thee vnpurueid, and vnready catche Thou must with the prophete stande and kepe watche. The .vii. rule. Enforce thy self not onely for to stande, Unuainquished against the deuils might, But ouer that take valiauntly on hande To vainquish him and put him vnto flight, And that is whan of the same dede thought or sight, By whiche he would haue thee with sinne contracte: Thou takest occasion of some good vertuous acte. Sometime he secretely casteth in thy minde, Some laudable dede to stirre thee to pride, As vainglory maketh many a man blinde, But let humilitie be thy sure guide, Thy good worke to god let it be applide Thinke it not thine, but a gift of his, Of whose grace vndoubtedly all goodnes is. The .viii. rule. In time of battaile so put thy self in preace, As though thou shouldest after that victorie Enioy for euer a perpetual peace: For god of his goodnes and liberall mercy May graunt thee gift, and eke thy proude enemy, Confounded and rebuked by thy battaile, Shall thee no more happely for very shame assaile. But when thou maist once the triumphe obtaine, Prepare thy self and trimme thee in thy geare, As thou shouldest incontinent fight again, For if thou be ready, the deuil wil thee feare, wherefore in any wise so euen thou thee beare, That thou remember and haue euer in memorie, In victory battaile, in battaile victorie. The .ix. rule. If thou thinke thy selfe well fensed and sure, Against euery sottle suggestion of vice, Consider fraile glasse may no distres endure, And great aduentures oft curse the dice: Ieoparde not to farre therefore and ye be wise, But euer more eschew the occasions of sinne, For he that loueth peril shall perishe therein. The .x. rule. In all temptacion withstande the beginning, The cursed infantes of wretched Babilon, To suffer them waxe is a ieopardous thing, Beate oute their braynes therefore at the stone, Perilous is the canker, that catcheth the bone, To late commeth the medicine, if thou let the sore, By long continuaunce encrease more and more. The .xi. rule. Though in the time of the battaile and warre, The conflict seme bitter sharpe and sowre, yet consider, it is more pleasure farre, Ouer the deuill to be a conqueroure, Then is in the vse of thy beastly pleasoure, Of vertue more ioy the conscience hath within, Then outwarde the body of all his filthy sinne. In this point many men erre for negligence: For they compare not the ioye of the victory, To the sensuall pleasure of their concupiscence, But like rude beastes vnaduisedly, Lacking discrecion thei compare and apply, Of their foule sinne the voluptuous delight To the laberous trauaile of the conflict and fight. And yet alas he that oft hath knowne, what griefe it is by long experience, Of his cruel enemy to be ouerthrowne, Should once at the least wise do his diligence To proue and assay with manly defence, what pleasure there is, what honour peace and rest, In glorious victory triumphe and conquest. The .xii. rule. Though thou be tempted, dispaire thee nothing, Remember the glorious apostle saint Poule, whan he had sene god in his parfit being, Lest such reuelacion should his heart extolle. His fleshe was suffred rebell against the soule, This did almightie god of his goodnes prouide, To preserue his seruaunt fro the daunger of pride. And here take hede that he whom god did loue, And for his most especial vessell chose, Rauished into the thirde heauen aboue, yet stode in peril lest pride might him depose, well ought we then our heartes fence and close, Against vain glory, the mother of reprief, The very crop and roote of al mischief. Against this pompe and wretched worldes glosse, Consider how Christ the lorde soueraine powere, Humbled himselfe for vs vnto the crosse, And paraduenture death within one howre, Shal vs bereue, wealthe riches and honowre, And bring vs downe full lowe bothe small and great, To vile carein and wretched wormes meate. The twelue weapons haue we more at length declared as foloweth. The twelue weapons of spirituall battayle, which euery manne shoulde haue at hand when the plessure of a sinnefull temptacion commeth to his minde. The pleasure litle and shorte The folowers griefe and heauinesse. The losse of a better thyng, This life a dreame and a shadowe. The death at our hande and vnware, The feare of impenitente departing. Eternal ioye, eternall payne, The nature and dignitie of man, The peace of a good minde, The great benefites of God, The painefull crosse of Christ, The witnes of martirs, and exaumple of saintes. The pleasure litle and short. Consider wel the pleasure that thou hast, Stande it in touching or in wanton light, In vaine smell, or in thy licorous tast. Or finally in whatsoeuer delite, Occupied is thy wretched appetite, Thou shalt it finde, when thou hast at cast, Little, simple, short, and sodainly past. The folowers griefe and heauines. Any good worke if thou with labour do, The labour goth, the goodnes doth remayne, If thou do euill with pleasure ioyned thereto, The pleasure, whiche thine euill worke doth contayne, Glideth his way, thou maist him not restraine, The euil then in thy brest cleaueth behynde, with grudge of heart, and heauines of minde. The losse of a better thing. When thou laborest thy pleasure for to bye, Uppon the price looke thou thee well aduise, Thou sellest thy soule therefore euen by and by, To thy moste vtter dispiteous enemies, O madde marchaunt, O foolish marchandise, To bye a tryfle, O childishe reckening, And paye therefore so dere a precious thing. This life a dreame and a shadowe. This wretched life, the trust and confidence Of whose continuaunce maketh vs bolde to synne, Thou perceiuest well by experience, Sithe that houre, in which it did beginne, It holdeth on the course, and will not linne, But fast it runneth on, and passen shall, As dothe a dreame or shadow on the wall. Death at our hande and vnware. Consider well that euer night and daye, while that we besily prouide and care For our disport reuill myrth and playe, For pleasaunt melody and daintie fare, Death stealeth on full slily and vnware. He lieth at hande, and shall vs enterprise, we wote not howe soone, nor in what manerwise. Feare of impenitent departing. If thou shouldest god offende, thinke howe therefore, Thou were foorthwith in very ieopardous case: For happly thou shouldest not liue an houre more Thy sinne to clense, and though thou hadst space, yet paraduenture shouldst thou lacke the grace, well ought we then be ferde to done offence, Impenitent lest we departen hence. Eternall rewarde eternall payne. Thou seest this worlde is but a thorowe fare, See thou behaue thee wisely with thine hoost, Hence must thou nedes departe naked and bare, And after thy desert looke to what coost Thou art conuaide at such time as thy goost From this wretched carcas shall disseuer, Be it ioye or paine, endure it shall for euer. The nature and dignitie of man. Remember how God hath made thee reasonable, Lyke vnto his ymage and figure, And for thee suffered paines intollerable, That he for angel neuer would endure: Regarde O man thine excellent nature, Thou that with angell art made to bene egall, For very shame be not the deuils thrall. The peace of a good mynde. Why louest thou so this brotle worldes ioye, Take all the mirth, take all the fantasies, Take euery game, take euery wanton toye, Take euery sporte, that menne can thee deuise, And among them all on warrantise Thou shalt no pleasure comparable finde To thinwarde gladnes of a vertuous minde. The great benefites of god. Beside that god thee bought and fourmed both, Many a benefite hast thou receiued of his, Though thou haue moued him often to be wroth, yet he thee kept hath and brought thee vp to this, And dayly calleth vpon thee to his blisse, How maist thou then to him vnlouing bee, That euer hath bene so louyng vnto thee? The painefull crosse of Christ. whan thou in flame of the temptacion friest, Thinke on the very lamentable paine, Thinke on the piteous crosse of woful Christ, Thinke on his bloode bet out at euery vaine, Thinke on his precious heart carued in twayne, Thinke howe for thy redempcion all was wrought, Let hym not leese that he so dere hath bought. The witnes of martirs and example of saintes. Sinne to withstande saye not thou lackest myght, Suche allegacions foly it is to vse, The witnes of sainctes and martirs constaunt sight, Shall thee of slouthfull cowardise accuse, God will thee helpe, if thou do not refuse, If other haue stande or this: thou maist eftsone, Nothing impossible is that hath bene done. The twelue propertees we haue at length more openly expressed in Balade, as it foloweth. The twelue properties or condicions of a louer. To loue one alone, and contempne al other for that one. To thinke him vnhappy, that is not with his loue. To adourne himself for the pleasure of his loue. To suffer all thyng, though it were death, to be with his loue. To desyre also to suffer shame harme for his loue, and to thynke that hurt swete. To be with his loue euer, as he maye, if not in dede, yet in thought. To loue all thyng that pertayneth vnto his loue. To coueit the praise of his loue, and not to suffer any dispraise. To beleue of his loue al thynges excellente, and to desyre that al folk should thynke the same. To wepe often with his loue, in presence for ioy, in absence for sorow, To languish euer and euer to burne in the desire of his loue. To serue his loue, nothing thinking of any rewarde or profite. [The .i. propertee.] The first point is to loue but one alone, And for that one all other to forsake, For whoso loueth many, loueth none: The floode that is in many channels take, In eche of them shall feble streames make, The loue that is deuided among many, Unneth suffiseth that euery part haue any. So thou that hast thy loue sette vnto god, In thy remembraunce this emprint and graue, As he in soueraine dignitie is odde, So will he in loue no parting felowes haue: Loue him therfore with all that he thee gaue, For body, soule, witte, cunnyng, minde and thought Parte will he none, but either all or nought. The .ii. propertee. Of his loue lo the sight and company To the louer so gladde and pleasaunt is, That whoso hath the grace to come thereby, He iudgeth him in perfit ioy and blisse, And whoso of that company dothe misse, Liue he in neuer so prosperous estate, He thinketh him wretched and infortunate. So shoulde the louer of God esteme that he, which all the pleasure hath, mirth and disport That in this worlde is possible to be, yet tyll the tune that he may once resort, Unto that blessed ioyfull heauenly port, Where he of god maye haue the glorious sight, Is voide of perfit ioye and sure delight. The .iii. propertee. The third point of a perfit louer is, To make him freshe to see that al thing bene, Appointed wel, and nothing set a mis, But all well fashioned, proper, goodly, clene, That in his parsone there be nothing sene, In speache, apparaile, gesture, looke or pace, That may offende or minish any grace. So thou that wilt with god geat into fauour, Garnish thy selfe vp in as goodly wise, As comely be, as honest in behauour, As it is possible for thee to deuise, I meane not hereby, that thou shouldest arise, And in the glasse vppon thy body prowle, But with faire vertue to adourne thy soule. The .iiii. propertee. If loue be strong, hote, mightie, and feruent, There maye no trouble, grief, or sorow fall, But that the louer would be well content All to endure, and thinke it eke to small, Though it wer death, so he might there withall The ioyfull presence of that parson get, On whom he hath his heart and loue yset. Thus should of god the louer be content Any distres or sorow to endure, Rather then to be from god absent, And glad to die, so that he maye be sure By his departing hence for to procure, After this valey darke, the heauenly light, And of his loue the glorious blessed sight. The .v. propertee. Not onely a louer content is in his hart, But coueteth eke, and longeth to sustaine Some labour, incommoditee, or smart, Losse, aduersitee, trouble, grief, or paine, And of his sorowe ioyfull is and faine, And happy thinketh himself, that he may take Some misaduenture for his louers sake. Thus shouldest thou, that louest god also In thine heart wish, coueit and be glad For him to suffer trouble paine and wo: For whom if thou be neuer so wo bestad, yet thou ne shalt sustain be not adrad, Half the dolour grief and aduersitee, That he already suffred hath for thee. The .vi. propertee. The parfite louer longeth for to be In presence of his loue bothe night and daie, And if it happly so be fal: that he May not as he would: he wil yet as he maie Euer be with his loue, that is to saie, Where his heauy body nil be brought, He wil be conuersaunt in minde and thought. Lo in lyke maner the louer of god shoulde, At the least in suche wise as he maye, If he may not in suche wise as he would, Be present with god, and conuersaunt alwaye: For certes who so list, he maye puruay, Though all the worlde woulde him therefro bereuen, To beare his body in earth, his minde in heuen. The .vii. propertee. There is no page or seruaunt moste or lest, That doth vpon his loue attende and waite, There is no little worme no simple best, Ne none so small a trifle or conceyte, Lase, girdle, point, or proper gloue straite, But that if to his loue it haue bene nere, The louer hath it precious, lief, and dere. So euery relique, ymage, or picture, That doth pertaine to goddes magnificence, The louer of god shoulde with al besy cure Haue it in loue, honour, and reuerence, And specially geue them preeminence, whiche daily done his blessed bodye wurche, The quicke reliques, the ministers of his churche. The .viii. propertee. A very louer aboue al earthly thing Coueiteth and longeth euermore to here Thonour, laude, commendacion and praising, And euery thyng that may the fame clere Of his loue he maye in no manere Endure to here that therefro mighten vary, Or any thyng sowne in to the contrary. The louer of god should coueit in like wise To here his honour, woorship, laude, and praise, whose soueraine goodnes none heart may comprise, whom hell, earth, and all the heauen obaise, whose perfite louer ought by no maner waise To suffer the cursed wordes of blasphemy, Or any thing spoken of god vnreuerently. The .ix. propertee. A very louer beleueth in his mynde, On whom so euer he hath his heart Ibente, That in that person menne maye nothing finde, But honorable, worthye, and excellent, And eke surmountyng farre in his entent All other that he hath knowen by sight or name, And woulde that euery manne should thinke thesame. Of god likewise so wonderfull and hie All thing esteme and iudge his louer ought. So reuerence, woorshippe, honour, and magnifie, That all the creatures in this worlde I wrought In comparison should he sette at nought, And glad be if he might the meane deuise, That all the worlde would thinken in likewise. The .x. propertee. The louer is of colour dead and pale, There will no slepe in to his eyes stalke, He sauoureth neither meate, wine, nor ale, He mindeth not, what menne about him talke, But eate he, drinke he, sitte, lye downe or walke, He burneth euer as it were with a fire In the feruent heate of his desire. Here shoulde the louer of god ensaumple take To haue him continually in remembraunce, with him in prayer and meditacion wake, whyle other playe, reuil, sing, and daunce, None earthly ioye, disporte, or vayne pleasaunce Should him delite, or any thyng remoue His ardent minde from god his heauenly loue. The .xi. propertee. Diuersly passioned is the louers hart, Now pleasaunt hope, now dread and grieuous fere, Now perfit blisse, now bitter sorowe smart, And whither his loue be with him or els where, Oft from his eyes there falleth many a tere For very ioy, when they together bee, when thei be sundred for aduersitee. Lyke affeccions feleth eke the brest Of gods louer in prayer and meditacion, whan that his loue liketh in him rest, with inward gladnes of pleasaunt contemplacion, Out breake the teares for ioy and delectacion: And whan his loue list eft to parte him fro Out breake the teares againe for paine and woe. The .xii. propertee. A very louer will his loue obaye, His ioye it is, and all his appetite To payne himselfe in all that euer he maye That parsone, in whome he sette hath his delite Diligentely to serue bothe daie and nighte For verie loue, without any regarde To any profite, gwerdone, or rewarde. So thou likewise, that haste thine hearte I sette Upwarde to God so well thy selfe endeuer, So studiouslye that nothing maie thee lette Not for his seruice any wise disseuere: Freelye looke eke thou serue that thereto neuer Truste of rewarde or profite dooe thee bynde: But onelye faithfull hearte and louinge minde. Wageles to serue three thinges maie vs moue, Firste if the seruice selfe be desirable, Seconde if thei whom that we serue and loue Bee verie good and verye amiable, Thirdelye of reason bee we seruisable withoute the gapyng after any more, To suche as haue done muche for vs before. Serue God for loue then, not for hope of meede, what seruice maie so desirable bee, As where all turneth to thyne owne spede? who is so good, so louelye eke as hee, who hath all readye done so muche for thee, As hee that firste thee made: and on the roode, Efte thee redemed with his precious bloode. A praier of Picus Mirandula vnto God O holy God of dreadfull maiestee, Uerely one in three, and three in one, whome Angels serue whose worke all creatures bee, whiche heauen and earth directest all alone, we thee beseche good Lorde with wofull mone, Spare vs wretches, and washe awaye our gilt, That we be not by thy iuste anger spilt. In straite balaunce of rigorous iudgement Psal,42.If thou shouldest our sinne ponder and waye: who able were to beare thy punishement? The whole engine of all this worlde I saie, The engine that enduren shall for aye, with suche examinacion might not stande Space of a moment in thine angry hande. who is not borne in sinne originall? who dothe not actuall sinne in sundry wise? But thou good lorde art he that sparest all, with pitious mercy tempering iustice: For as thou dost rewardes vs deuise Aboue our merite, so dost thou dispence Thy punishment farre vnder our offence. More is thy mercy farre then all our sinne, To geue them also that vnworthy bee, More godly is, and more mercy therein, Howbeit, worthy ynough are thei pardee, Be thei neuer so vnworthy: whom that hee List to accept, whiche where so euer he taketh, whom he vnworthy findeth worthy maketh. wherefore good lorde that aye mercifull art, Unto thy grace and soueraine dignitee, we sely wretches crye with humble heart Our sinne forgeat, and our malignitee, with piteous eyes of thy benignitee, Frendely looke on vs once, thine owne we bee, Seruauntes or sinners whither it liketh thee. Sinners if thou our crime beholde certaine, Our crime the worke of our vncorteyse mynde, But if thy giftes thou beholde againe, Thy giftes noble wonderfull and kinde, Thou shalt vs then thesame parsones finde, which are to thee and haue be long space, Seruauntes by nature, children by thy grace. But this thy goodnes wringeth vs alas, For we, whom grace had made thy children dere, Are made thy gilty folke by our trespace, Sinne hath vs gilty made this many a yere, But let thy grace, thy grace that hath no pere, Of our offence surmounten all the preace, That in our sinne thine honour may encreace. For though thy wisedome, though thy soueraigne powre, May other wise appeare sufficiently, As thinges whiche thy creatures euery howre, All with one voice declare and testifie, Thy goodnes, yet thy singuler mercy, Thy piteous heart, thy gracious indulgence Nothing so clerely sheweth as our offence. What but our synne hath shewed that mighty loue, whiche able was thy dreadfull magestee, To drawe downe into earth fro heauen aboue, And crucifie god, that we poore wretches wee, Should from our filthy sinne yclensed bee, with bloode and water of thine owne side, That streamed from thy blessed woundes wide. Thy loue and pitie thus O heauenly king, Our euill maketh, matter of thy goodnes, O loue, O pitie our wealth aie prouiding, O goodnes seruing thy seruantes in distres, O loue, O pitie wel nigh now thankles O goodnes mightie gracious and wise, And yet almost vainquished with our vyce. Graunt I thee praie, suche heat into mine heart, That to this loue of thine may be egal: Graunt me fro Sathanas seruice to astart, with whom me rueth so long to haue be thrall Graunt me good lorde, and creatour of all, The flame to quenche of all sinnefull desire, And in thy loue sette all mine heart a fire. That whan the iorney of this deadly life My sely goost hath finished, and thence Departen must. without his fleshly wife Alone into his lordes high presence He maye thee finde: O well of indulgence, In thy lordeship not as a lorde: but rather As a very tender louing father. Amen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These fowre thinges here folowyng Mayster Thomas More wrote in his youth for his pastime. A mery jest how a sergeant would learne to playe the frere. Written by maister Thomas More in hys youth. Wyse men alway, Affyrme and say, That best is for a man: Diligently, For to apply, The busines that he can, And in no wyse, To enterpryse, An other faculte, For he that wyll, And can no skyll, Is never lyke to the. He that hath lafte, The hosiers crafte, And falleth to making shone, The smythe that shall, To payntyng fall, His thrift is well nigh done. A blacke draper, With whyte paper, To goe to writyng scole, An olde butler, Becum a cutler, I wene shall proue a fole. And an olde trot, That can god wot, Nothyng but kysse the cup, With her phisick, Wil kepe one sicke, Tyll she haue soused hym up. A man of lawe, That neuer sawe, The wayes to bye and sell, Wenyng to ryse, By marchaundise, I pray god spede hym well. A marchaunt eke, That wyll goo seke, By all the meanes he may, To fall in sute, Tyll he dispute, His money cleane away. Pletyng the lawe, For every strawe, Shall prove a thrifty man, With bate and strife, But by my life, I cannot tell you whan. Whan an hatter Wyll go smatter, In philosophy, Or a pedlar, Waxe a medlar, In theology, All that ensue, Suche craftes new, They driue so farre a cast, That euermore, They do therfore, Beshrewe themselfe at last. This thing was tryed And verefyed, Here by a sergeaunt late, That thriftly was, Or he coulde pas, Rapped about the pate, Whyle that he would See how he could, In goddes name play the frere: Now yf you wyll, Knowe how it fyll, Take hede and ye shall here. It happed so, Not long a go, A thrifty man there dyed, An hundred pounde, Of nobles rounde, That had he layd a side: His sonne he wolde, Should haue this golde, For to beginne with all: But to suffise His chylde, well thrise, That money was to smal. Yet or this day I haue hard say, That many a man certesse, Hath with good cast, Be ryche at last, That hath begonne with lesse. But this yonge manne, So well beganne, His money to imploy, That certainly, His policy, To see it was a joy. For lest sum blast, Myght over cast, His ship, or by mischaunce, Men with sum wile, Myght hym begyle, And minish his substaunce, For to put out, All maner dout, He made a good puruay, For every whyt, By his owne wyt, And toke an other way: First fayre and wele, Therof much dele, He dygged it in a pot, But then him thought, That way was nought, And there he left it not. So was he faine, From thence agayne, To put it in a cup, And by and by, Couetously, He supped it fayre vp. In his owne brest, He thought it best, His money to enclose, Then wist he well, Whateuer fell, He coulde it neuer lose. He borowed then, Of other men, Money and marchaundise: Never payd it, Up he laid it, In like maner wyse. Yet on the gere, That he would were, He rought not what he spent, So it were nyce, As for the price, Could him not miscontent. With lusty sporte, And with resort, Of joly company, In mirth and play, Full many a day, He liued merely. And men had sworne, Some man is borne, To haue a lucky howre, And so was he, For such degre, He gat and suche honour, That without dout, Whan he went out, A sergeaunt well and fayre, Was redy strayte, On him to wayte, As sone as on the mayre. But he doubtlesse, Of his mekenesse, Hated such pompe and pride, And would not go, Companied so, But drewe himself a side, To saint Katherine, Streight as a line, He gate him at a tyde, For deuocion, Or promocion, There would he nedes abyde. There spent he fast, Till all was past, And to him came there meny, To aske theyr det, But none could get, The valour of a peny. With visage stout, He bare it out, Even vnto the harde hedge, A month or twaine, Tyll he was faine, To laye his gowne to pledge. Than was he there, In greater feare, Than ere that he came thither, And would as fayne, Depart againe, But that he wist not whither. Than after this, To a frende of his, He went and there abode, Where as he lay, So sick alway, He myght not come abrode. It happed than, A marchant man, That he ought money to, Of an officere, Than gan enquere, What him was best to do. And he answerde, Be not aferde, Take an accion therfore, I you beheste, I shall hym reste, And than care for no more. I feare quod he, It wyll not be, For he wyll not come out. The sergeaunt said, Be not afrayd, It shall be brought about. In many a game, Lyke to the same, Haue I bene well in ure, And for your sake, Let me be bake, But yf I do this cure. Thus part they both, And foorth then goth, A pace this officere, And for a day, All his array, He chaunged with a frere. So was he dight, That no man might, Hym for a frere deny, He dopped and dooked, He spake and looked, So religiously. Yet in a glasse, Or he would passe, He toted and he peered, His harte for pryde, Lepte in his syde, To see how well he freered. Than forth a pace, Unto the place, He goeth in goddes name, To do this dede, But now take hede, For here begynneth the game. He drew hym ny, And softely, Streyght at the dore he knocked: And a damsell, That hard hym well, There came and it vnlocked. The frere sayd, God spede fayre mayd, Here lodgeth such a man, It is told me: Well syr quod she, And yf he do what than. Quod he maystresse, No harme doutelesse: It longeth for our order, To hurt no man, But as we can, Every wight to forder. With hym truly, Fayne speake would I. Sir quod she by my fay, He is so sike, Ye be not lyke, To speake with hym to day. Quod he fayre may, Yet I you pray, This much at my desyre, Uouchesafe to do, As go hym to, And say an austen fryre. Would with hym speke, And matters breake, For his auayle certayn. Quod she I wyll, Stonde ye here styll, Tyll I come downe agayn. Up is she go, And told hym so, As she was bode to say. He mistrustyng, No maner thyng, Sayd mayden go thy way, And fetche him hyder, That we togyder, May talk. Adowne she gothe, Up she hym brought, No harme she thought, But it made some folke wrothe. This officere, This fayned frere, Whan he was come aloft, He dopped than, And grete this man, Religiously and oft. And he agayn, Ryght glad and fayn, Toke hym there by the hande, The frere than sayd, Ye be dismayd, With trouble I vnderstande. In dede quod he, It hath with me, Bene better than it is. Syr quod the frere, Be of good chere, Yet shall it after this. For Christes sake, Loke that you take, No thought within your brest: God may tourne all, And so he shall, I trust vnto the best. But I would now, Comen with you, In counsayle yf you please, Or ellys nat Of matters that, Shall set your heart at ease. Downe went the mayd, The marchaunt sayd, Now say on gentle frere, Of thys tydyng, That ye me bryng, I long full sore to here. Whan there was none, But they alone, The frere with euyll grace, Sayd, I rest the, Come on with me, And out he toke his mace: Thou shalt obay, Come on thy way, I haue the in my clouche, Thou goest not hence, For all the pense, The mayre hath in his pouche. This marchaunt there, For wrath and fere, He waxyng welnygh wood, Sayd horson thefe, With a mischefe, Who hath taught the thy good. And with his fist, Upon the lyst, He gave hym such a blow, That backward downe, Almost in sowne, The frere is ouerthrow. Yet was this man, Well fearder than, Lest he the frere had slayne, Tyll with good rappes, And heuy clappes, He dawde hym vp agayne. The frere toke harte, And vp he starte, And well he layde about, And so there goth, Betwene them both, Many a lusty cloute. They rent and tere, Eche others here, And claue togyder fast, Tyll with luggyng, And with tuggyng, They fell downe bothe at last. Than on the grounde, Togyder rounde, With many a sadde stroke, They roll and rumble, They turne and tumble, As pygges do in a poke. So long aboue, They heue and shoue, Togider that at last, The mayd and wyfe, To breake the strife, Hyed them vpward fast. And whan they spye, The captaynes lye, Both waltring on the place, The freres hood, They pulled a good, Adowne about his face. Whyle he was blynde, The wenche behynde, Lent him leyd on the flore, Many a joule, About the noule, With a great batyldore. The wyfe came yet, And with her fete, She holpe to kepe him downe, And with her rocke, Many a knocke, She gave hym on the crowne. They layd his mace, About his face, That he was wood for payne: The fryre frappe, Gate many a swappe, Tyll he was full nygh slayne. Up they hym lift, And with yll thrift, Hedlyng a long the stayre, Downe they hym threwe, And sayd adewe, Commaunde us to the mayre. The frere arose, But I suppose, Amased was his hed, He shoke his eares, And from grete feares, He thought hym well a fled. Quod he now lost, Is all this cost, We be neuer the nere. Ill mote he the, That caused me, To make my selfe a frere. Now masters all, Here now I shall, Ende there as I began, In any wyse, I would auyse, And counsayle euery man, His owne craft vse, All newe refuse, And lyghtly let them gone: Play not the frere, Now make good chere, And welcome every chone. Finis. [Nine Pageants] Mayster Thomas More in his youth devysed in hys fathers house in London, a goodly hangyng of fyne paynted clothe, with nyne pageauntes, and verses ouer of euery of those pageauntes: which verses expressed and declared, what the ymages in those pageauntes represented: and also in those pageauntes were paynted, the thynges that the verses ouer them dyd (in effecte) declare, whiche verses here folowe. Chyldhod.In the first pageant was painted a boy playing at the top and squyrge. And ouer this pageaunt was writen as foloweth. I am called Chyldhod, in play is all my mynde, To cast a coyte, a cokstele, and a ball. A toppe can I set, and dryue it in his kynde. But would to god these hatefull bookes all, Were in a fyre brent to pouder small. Than myght I lede my lyfe alwayes in play: Whiche lyfe god sende me to myne endyng day. Manhod.In the second pageaunt was paynted a goodly freshe yonge man, rydyng vppon a goodly horse, havynge an hawke on his fyste, and a brase of grayhowndes folowyng hym. And vnder the horse fete, was paynted the same boy, that in the fyrst pageaunte was playinge at the top and squyrge. And ouer this second pageant the wrytyng was thus. Manhod I am therefore I me delyght, To hunt and hawke, to nourishe up and fede, The grayhounde to the course, the hawke to the flyght, And to bestryde a good and lusty stede. These thynges become a very man in dede, yet thynketh this boy his pevishe game swetter, But what no force, his reason is no better. Venus and Cupyde.In the thyrd pagiaunt, was paynted the goodly younge man, in the seconde pagiaunt lyeng on the grounde. And vppon hym stode ladye Venus goddes of loue, and by her vppon this man stode the lytle god Cupyde. And ouer this thyrd pageaunt, this was the wrytyng that foloweth. who so ne knoweth the strength power and myght, Of Venus and me her lytle sonne Cupyde, Thou Manhod shalt a myrrour bene a ryght, By vs subdued for all thy great pryde, My fyry dart perceth thy tender syde, Now thou whiche erst despysedst children small, Shall waxe a chylde agayne and be my thrall. Age.In the fourth pageaunt was paynted an olde sage father sittyng in a chayre. And lyeng vnder his fete was painted the ymage of Venus and Cupyde, that were in the third pageant. And ouer this fourth pageant the scripture was thus. Olde Age am I, with lokkes, thynne and hore, Of our short lyfe, the last and best part. Wyse and discrete: the publike wele therefore, I help to rule to my labour and smart, Therefore Cupyde withdrawe thy fyry dart, Chargeable matters shall of loue oppresse, The childish game and ydle bysinesse. Deth.In the fyfth pageaunt was paynted an ymage of Death: and vnder hys fete lay the olde man in the fourth pageaunte. And aboue this fift pageant, this was the saying. Though I be foule ugly lene and mysshape, yet there is none in all this worlde wyde, That may my power withstande or escape, Therefore sage father greatly magnifyed, Discende from your chayre, set a part your pryde, Witsafe to lende (though it be to your payne) To me a fole, some of your wise brayne. Fame.In the sixt pageant was painted lady Fame. And vnder her fete was the picture of Death that was in the fifth pageant. And ouer this sixt pageaunt the writyng was as foloweth. Fame I am called, maruayle you nothing, Though I with tonges am compassed all rounde For in voyce of people is my chiefe liuyng. O cruel death, thy power I confounde. When thou a noble man hast brought to grounde Maugry thy teeth to lyue cause hym shall I, Of people in parpetuall memory. Tyme.In the seuenth pageant was painted the ymage of Tyme, and vnder hys fete was lyeng the picture of Fame that was in the sixt pageant. And this was the scripture ouer this seuenth pageaunt. I whom thou seest with horyloge in hande, Am named tyme, the lord of every howre, I shall in space destroy both see and lande. O simple fame, how darest thou man honowre, Promising of his name, an endlesse flowre, Who may in the world have a name eternall, When I shall in proces distroy the world and all. Eternitee.In the eyght pageant was pictured the ymage of lady Eternitee, sittyng in a chayre vnder a sumptious clothe of estate, crowned with an imperial crown. And vnder her fete lay the picture of Time, that was in the seuenth pageant. And aboue this eight pageaunt, was it writen as foloweth. Me nedeth not to bost, I am Eternitee, The very name signifyeth well, That myne empyre infinite shal be. Thou mortall Tyme every man can tell, Art nothyng els but the mobilite, Of sonne and mone chaungyng in euery degre, When they shall leue theyr course thou shalt be brought, For all thy pride and bostyng into nought. The ninth pageant, in Latin verse, has been omitted. A ruful lamentaci? (writen by master Thomas More in his youth) of the deth of quene Elisabeth mother to king Henry the eight, wife to king Henry the seu?th, &amp; eldest doughter to king Edward the fourth, which quene Elisabeth dyed in childbed in February in the yere of our lord 1503 &amp; in the 18. yere of the raigne of king Henry the seuenth. O ye that put your trust and confidence, In worldly ioy and frayle prosperite, That so lyue here as ye should neuer hence, Remember death and loke here vppon me. Ensaumple I thynke there may no better be. your selfe wotte well that in this realme was I, your quene but late, and lo now here I lye. was I not borne of olde worthy linage? was not my mother queene my father kyng? was I not a kinges fere in marriage? Had I not plenty of every pleasaunt thyng? Mercifull god this is a straunge reckenyng: Rychesse, honour, welth, and auncestry Hath me forsaken and lo now here I ly. If worship myght haue kept me, I had not gone. If wyt myght haue me saued, I neded not fere. If money myght haue holpe, I lacked none. But O good God what vayleth all this gere. When deth is come thy mighty messangere, Obey we must there is no remedy, Me hath he sommoned, and lo now here I ly. yet was I late promised otherwyse, This yere to liue in welth and delice. Lo where to commeth thy blandishyng promyse, O false astrolagy and deuynatrice, Of goddes secretes makyng thy selfe so wyse? How true is for this yere thy prophecy? The yere yet lasteth, and lo nowe here I ly. O bryttill welth, ay full of bitternesse, Thy single pleasure doubled is with payne. Account my sorow first and my distresse, In sondry wyse, and recken there agayne, The joy that I haue had, and I dare sayne, For all my honour, endured yet have I, More wo then welth, and lo now here I ly. Where are our Castels, now where are our Towers? Goodly Rychmonde sone art thou gone from me, At westminster that costly worke of yours, Myne owne dere lorde now shall I neuer see. Almighty god vouchesafe to graunt that ye, For you and your children well may edefy. My palyce bylded is, and lo now here I ly. Adew myne owne dere spouse my worthy lorde, The faithfull loue, that dyd vs both combyne, In mariage and peasable concorde, Into your handes here I cleane resyne To be bestowed vppon your children and myne, Erst wer you father, &amp; now must ye supply, The mothers part also, for lo now here I ly. Farewell my doughter lady Margarete. God wotte full oft it greued hath my mynde, That ye should go where we should seldome mete. Now am I gone, and haue left you behynde, O mortall folke that we be very blinde, That we least feare, full oft it is most nye, From you depart I fyrst, and lo now here I lye. Farewell Madame my lordes worthy mother, Comfort your sonne, and be ye of good chere, Take all a worth, for it will be no nother. Farewell my doughter Katherine late the fere, To prince Arthur myne owne chyld so dere, It booteth not for me to wepe or cry, Pray for my soule, for lo now here I ly. Adew lord Henry my louyng sonne adew. Our lorde encrease your honour and estate, Adew my doughter Mary bright of hew. God make you vertuous wyse and fortunate. Adew swete hart my litle doughter Kate, Thou shalt swete babe suche is thy desteny, Thy mother neuer know, for lo now here I ly. Lady Cicyly Anne and Katheryne. Farewell my welbeloued sisters three, O lady Briget other sister myne, Lo here the ende of worldly vanitee. Now well are ye that earthly foly flee, And heuenly thynges loue and magnify, Farewell and pray for me, for lo now here I ly. Adew my lordes, adew my ladies all, Adew my faithfull seruauntes every chone, Adew my commons whom I never shall, See in this world wherfore to the alone, Immortall god verely three and one, I me commende thy infinite mercy, Shew to thy seruant, for lo now here I ly. Certain meters in english written by master Thomas More in hys youth for the boke of Fortune, and caused them to be printed in the begynnyng of that boke. The wordes of Fortune to the people. Mine high estate power and auctoritie, If ye ne know, enserche and ye shall spye, That richesse, worship, welth, and dignitie, Joy, rest, and peace, and all thyng fynally, That any pleasure or profit may come by, To mannes comfort, ayde, and sustinaunce, Is all at my deuyse and ordinaunce. Without my fauour there is nothyng wonne. Many a matter haue I brought at last, To good conclusion, that fondly was begonne. And many a purpose, bounden sure and fast with wise prouision, I have ouercast. without good happe there may no wit suffise, Better is to be fortunate than wyse. And therefore hath there some men bene or this, My deadly foes and written many a boke, To my disprayse. And other cause there nys, But for me list not frendly on them loke, Thus lyke the fox they fare that once forsoke, The pleasaunt grapes, and gan for to defy them, Because he lept and yet could not come by them. But let them write theyr labour is in vayne, For well ye wote, myrth, honour, and richesse, Much better is than penury and payne. The nedy wretch that lingereth in distresse, without myne helpe is euer comfortlesse, A wery burden odious and loth, To all the world, and eke to him selfe both. But he that by my fauour may ascende, To mighty power and excellent degree, A common wele to gouerne and defende, O in how blist condicion standeth he: Him self in honour and felicite, And ouer that, may forther and encrease, A region hole in joyfull rest and peace. Now in this poynt there is no more to say, Eche man hath of him self the gouernaunce. Let every wight than folowe his owne way. And he that our of pouertee and mischaunce, List for to live, and wyll hym selfe enhaunce, In wealth &amp; richesse, come forth and wayte on me. And he that wyll be a beggar, let hym be. Thomas More to them that trust in fortune. Thou that art prowde of honour shape or kynne. That hepest vp this wretched worldes treasure, Thy fingers shrined with gold, thy tawny skynne, With fresh apparayle garnished out of measure, And wenest to haue fortune at thy pleasure, Cast up thyne eye, and loke how slipper chaunce, Illudeth her men with chaunge and varyaunce. Sometyme she loketh as louely fayre and bright, As goodly Uenus mother of Cupyde. She becketh and she smileth on euery wight. But this chere fayned, may not long abide. There commeth a cloude, and farewell all our pryde. Like any serpent she beginneth to swell, And looketh as fierce as any fury of hell. yet for all that we brotle men are fayne, (So wretched is our nature and so blynde) As soone as Fortune list to laugh agayne, With fayre countenaunce and disceitfull mynde, To crouche and knele and gape after the wynde, Not one or twayne but thousandes in a rout, Lyke swarmyng bees come flickeryng her aboute. Then as a bayte she bryngeth forth her ware, Silver, gold, riche perle, and precious stone: On whiche the mased people gase and stare, And gape therefore, as dogges doe for the bone. Fortune at them laugheth, and in her trone Amyd her treasure and waveryng rychesse, Prowdly she houeth as lady and empresse. Fast by her syde doth wery Labour stand, Pale Fere also, and Sorow all bewept, Disdayn and Hatred on that other hand, Eke restles watche fro slepe with trauayle kept, His eyes drowsy and lokyng as he slept. Before her standeth Daunger and Enuy, Flattery, Dysceyt, Mischiefe and Tiranny. About her commeth all the world to begge. He asketh lande, and he to pas would bryng, This toye and that, and all not worth an egge: He would in loue prosper aboue all thyng: He kneleth downe and would be made a kyng: He forceth not so he may money haue, Though all the worlde accompt hym for a knaue. Lo thus ye see diuers heddes, diuers wittes. Fortune alone as diuers as they all, Unstable here and there among them flittes: And at auenture downe her giftes fall, Catch who so may she throweth great and small Not to all men, as commeth sonne or dewe, But for the most part, all among a fewe. And yet her brotell giftes long may not last. He that she gaue them, loketh prowde and hye. She whirlth about and pluckth away as fast, And geueth them to an other by and by. And thus from man to man continually, She vseth to geve and take, and slily tosse, One man to wynnyng of an others losse. And when she robbeth one, down goth his pryde. He wepeth and wayleth and curseth her full sore. But he that receueth it, on that other syde, Is glad, and blesth her often tymes therefore. But in a whyle when she loueth hym no more, She glydeth from hym, and her giftes to. And he her curseth as other fooles do. Alas the folysh people can not cease, Ne voyd her trayne, tyll they the harme do fele. About her alway, besely they preace. But lord how he doth thynk hym self full wele. That may set once his hande vppon her whele. He holdeth fast: but vpwarde as he flieth, She whippeth her whele about, and there he lyeth. Thus fell Julius from his mighty power. Thus fell Darius the worthy kyng of Perse. Thus fell Alexander the great conquerour. Thus many mo then I may well reherse. Thus double fortune, when she lyst reuerse Her slipper fauour fro them that in her trust, She fleeth her wey and leyeth them in the dust. She sodeinly enhaunceth them a loft. And sodeynly mischeueth all the flocke. The head that late lay easily and full soft, In stede of pylows lyeth after on the blocke. And yet alas the most cruell proude mocke: The deynty mowth that ladyes kissed haue, She bryngeth in the case to kysse a knaue. In chaungying of her course, the chaunge shewth this, Up startth a knaue, and downe there falth a knyght, The beggar ryche, and the ryche man pore is. Hatred is turned to loue, loue to despyght. This is her sport, thus proueth she her myght. Great boste she maketh yf one be by her power, Welthy and wretched both within an howre. Povertee that of her giftes wyl nothing take, Wyth mery chere, looketh vppon the prece, And seeth how fortunes houshold goeth to wrake. Fast by her standeth the wyse Socrates. Arristippus, Pythagoras, and many a lese. Of olde Philosophers. And eke agaynst the sonne Bekyth hym poore Diogenes in his tonne. With her is Byas, whose countrey lackt defence, And whylom of their foes stode so in dout, That eche man hastely gan to cary thence, And asked hym why he nought caryed out. I bere quod he all myne with me about: Wisedom he ment, not fortunes brotle fees. For nought he counted his that he might leese. Heraclitus eke, lyst felowship to kepe With glad pouertee, Democritus also: Of which the fyrst can neuer cease but wepe, To see how thick the blynded people go, With labour great to purchase care and wo. That other laugheth to see the foolysh apes, Howe earnestly they walke about theyr tapes. Of this poore sect, it is comen vsage, Onely to take that nature may sustayne, Banishing cleane all other surplusage, They be content, and of nothyng complayne. No nygarde eke is of his good so fayne, But they more pleasure have a thousande folde, The secrete draughtes of nature to beholde. Set fortunes seruauntes by them and ye wull, That one is free, that other euer thrall, That one content, that other neuer full. That one in suretye, that other lyke to fall. Who lyst to aduise them bothe, parceyue he shall, As great difference betwene them as we see, Betwixte wretchednes and felicite. Now haue I shewed you bothe: chese whiche ye lyst, Stately fortune, or humble pouertee: That is to say, nowe lyeth it in your fyst, To take here bondage, or free libertee. But in thys poynte and ye do after me, Draw you to fortune, and labour her to please, If that ye thynke your selfe to well at ease. And fyrst, vppon the louely shall she smile, And frendly on the cast her wandering eyes, Embrace the in her armes, and for a whyle, Put the and kepe the in a fooles paradise: And foorth with all what so thou lyst deuise, She wyll the graunt it liberally parhappes: But for all that beware of after clappes. Recken you neuer of her fauoure sure: ye may in clowds as easily trace an hare, Or in drye lande cause fishes to endure, And make the burnyng fyre his heate to spare, And all thys worlde in compace to forfare, As her to make by craft or engine stable, That of her nature is euer variable. Serue her day and nyght as reuerently, Uppon thy knees as any seruaunt may, And in conclusion, that thou shalt winne thereby Shall not be worth thy seruyce I dare say. And looke yet what she geueth the to day, With labour wonne she shall happly to morow Pluck it agayne out of thyne hande with sorow. Wherefore yf thou in suretye lyst to stande, Take pouerties parte and let prowde fortune go, Receyue nothyng that commeth from her hande: Loue maner and vertue: they be onely tho. Whiche double fortune may not take the fro. Then mayst thou boldly defye her turnyng chaunce: She can the neyther hynder nor auaunce. But and thou wylt nedes medle with her treasure, Trust not therein, and spende it liberally. Beare the not proude, nor take not out of measure. Bylde not thyne house on heyth vp in the skye None falleth farre, but he that climbeth hye, Remember nature sent the hyther bare, The gyftes of fortune count them borowed ware. Thomas More to them that seke fortune. Whoso delyteth to prouen and assay, Of waueryng fortune the uncertayne lot, If that the aunswere please you not alway, Blame ye not me: for I commaunde you not, Fortune to trust, and eke full well ye wot, I have of her no brydle in my fist, She renneth loose, and turneth where she lyst. The rollyng dyse in whome your lucke doth stande, With whose vnhappy chaunce ye be so wroth, Ye knowe your selfe came neuer in myne hande. Lo in this ponde be fyshe and frogges both. Cast in your nette: but be you liefe or lothe, Holde you content as fortune lyst assyne: For it is your owne fishyng and not myne. And though in one chaunce fortune you offend, Grudge not there at, but beare a mery face. In many an other she shall it amende. There is no manne so farre out of her grace, But he sometyme hath comfort and solace: Ne none agayne so farre foorth in her fauour, That is full satisfyed with her behauiour. Fortune is stately, solemne, prowde, and hye: And rychesse geueth, to have seruyce therefore. The nedy begger catcheth an halfpeny: Some manne a thousande pounde, some lesse some more. But for all that she kepeth euer in store, From euery manne some parcell of his wyll, That he may pray therfore and serue her styll. Some manne hath good, but chyldren hath he none, Some man hath both, but he can get none health. Some hath al thre, but vp to honours trone, Can he not crepe, by no maner of stelth. To some she sendeth, children, ryches, welthe, Honour, woorshyp, and reuerence all hys lyfe: But yet she pyncheth hym with a shrewde wyfe. Then for asmuch as it is fortunes guyse, To graunt no manne all thyng that he wyll axe, But as her selfe lyst order and devyse, Dothe euery manne his parte diuide and tax, I counsayle you eche one trusse vp your packes, And take no thyng at all, or be content, With suche rewarde as fortune hath you sent.He meaneth the booke of fortune. All thynges in this boke that ye shall rede, Doe as ye lyst, there shall no manne you bynde, Them to beleve, as surely as your crede. But notwithstandyng certes in my mynde, I durst well swere, as true ye shall them fynde, In euery poynt eche answere by and by, As are the iudgementes of Astronomye. Thus endeth the preface to the booke of fortune.</field>
