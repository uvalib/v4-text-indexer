      <field name="fulltext">THE ENGLISH POEMS 1. Loues Lament Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. My loue allace is loathsum wnto me, restles I liue in absence of my sweete. The harde mishapis I have incurred latelye hes w? dispaire o?? quhelm'd my weerie spreit. Ohe loyell saull, is this ye fates decreete, ma? I no? haue y? presens as befoir? Adew, contentment, till thow me intreit, so sall be sene ay till thow me restoir. Knew I allace ye way I my? deploir, not to ye world, but to thy self my teers. Onlie by the ma? cuirit be my soir, ten thousannd heartes ma? no? sustene sic weeres. No worldlie pleesure can expell my paine, but presence of my deerest deere agane. 2. Ane Dyor [Quhen diaphantus knew] Quhen diaphantus knew the destanyes decreete, Quhenn he was forcet for to forgoe his deere and loving sweit, Ouervoited with ye vailles of balme rebaiting trees, Ourgazeinges grouflings on ye gronde with death prent in his eyes, Oft preeisit hee to speeke. Ohe quhile hee did assaye The agonizing dread of deathe his wrastling voyce did stay. At last as one quho stryues aganes both woe and shame, diere charridora can he crye myne a? adoirit dame, First I attest thy name syne nixt the godds aboue, But cheefe of thes, that boy that beeris, ye staitely stile of loue. Let thoese recoirds w? me, what was my constante pairt, And giue I did noucht honour the with ane weell hallowit hairt To sacreefice to the my secreete chaist desyres Vpoun thy bewties alter brunte with neuer quenching fyeris. Thow was that idole still quhoes Image I adoirit, The sanct to quhome I made my vowes quhoes pities I imploirit, The stare which saued my schipe from tempest of dispair Quhen the horizoun of my hoipe ou'r cloudit was with cair. Thow was that soueraigne balme that sweet catholick saw Quhilk couerit me of all my ills, that did my heart ou'rthrow. But now such strange event's hes interveinit sen syne That I dare not avow to saye nor think that thow art myne, Quhilk makes me to insert in thois my sorrowing songes The histories of my mishaps my miseries and wronges. Noucht that I can accuise my charidora no, I onlie execrate the Wierds cheefe workeris of my woe. Sould schoe quhom I haue seruit sua mony lo?sum ?eeris, For quhom my dew distelling eyes hes sched suche storme of teirs, Sould schoe, I say be made ane pray to suche a one Quho for her saike he never gave not ane vntymely grone? No suirelie swrelie no the weirdes may doe me wrong And mak her by there bade decreete to quhom schoe suld belong, Becaus the heavin dothe blenke on sum moir blyther yen on me And giue them giftes moir plawsible to charme a churles eye. ?et dare I weell compaire yea peraduenture vaunte That schoe is myne by richt of loue thoucht luck in love I wante. Albeit my horoscope Invaide my worldlie thinges, ?it into loue it gaue me liue for to compair with kinges. For giue I knew there were beneathe the starrie skye That durst avow to loue my loue moir faithfullie then I, I would ryue out this heart which interteanes my breathe And cast it doune befoir her feete and dye a schamefull death. But sen boith tyme and schoe hes tryit me to be trew And founde such faithfullnes in me as salbe founde in few, I rest secuire in that and cair noucht wha pretend, The mae presoome the mair my pairt proues perfit to ye end And wtheris faithless faythe in ballaunce put with myne Sall mak my treuth for to triumph and lyke a sunne to schyne. There sall no change of tyme, of heavin, of soile, noir ayre, Inforce me to forgett my vowes maide to my fairest fair, Quhilk now I heere renew In solemne forme againe That to witnes as I beganne so sall I suire rema?ne. I sweere by thy tuo eyne my onlie dearest deare, And by the stageoun stankes of hell by which ye gods do sweir, That thow arte onlie schoe quhois countenance I crave, That I salbe in lyfe and death thy best affected slaue, That I sall neither sighe nor sobe nor ?it sall greit nor grone For one that euer sall tak lyfe, saif the evin the allone, That there sall no deceit of lovelye laughing ene Nor charmeing sounds of syrion songes nor fare fetchit sighes betuene Deface out of my mynde whiche are so suire Imprest Thy wordes soe wyse, thy luikes so grave, thy maneris so modest, That day sall nevir daw nor sunne sall never schyne Sall quarrell me for appostate for naucht remayneing thyne. And that which heere I sweere least sylence suld it smoir The verie trees sall testiefie quhilk onlie are befoir, And cheefe and aboue all this holeine sade and grene Into the quhilk thy name and myne in graven ma? be sene. O happie happie tree quhoes euer blessit barke Sall ludge the trophie of our loue for thy Immortall worke, Quhilk hes the force to caus the memorie rema?ne Sequestrate from the bastard soirt of trees which are prophane, And quhenn the rest salbe ouerpast with cairles eye ?et sall thow be adorit and kist for charidorais trei. ?et peraduenture to For diaphantus saike Sum rectles bodie cumming by will homage to the make. Thus blisst sall thow remayne quhenn I salbe agast Into quhat corner of the eirth poore wretch I salbe cast. Indeid all is in doubt saue this we mone depairt, The bodye must in pilgrime be and shee must haue ye hart, The thoucht of quhilk exyle and dolorous devoirce Breedes sorrow sorrow heer in me this eloquence perforce. For quhill I was resoluit to thesaurize my greeife, Becaus that it sould move in men moir mervell nor beleef, The never ceassing feide of melancounterous faites Ouerhaistnit this abortiue birth of Importune regrates To witnes to the world that my mishaps are suche That thoucht I murne lyke man half mad I cannot murne too much. For giue of all mishaps this be the first of all, To haue bene happie happie anes and fra yat hap to fall, I wote I ma? weell say that diaphantus name Is the sononyme of all mishaps and signifies the same. For giue there wer no hell but out of heavin to bee, Considder what her wante wald worke whois sy? wes hevin to me. I think all thois that speekes of sorrow sould think shame Quhenn diaphantus salbe heard for charidorais name. Her bewtie was but bloote, her treuth wes vnreprovit, The ane deseruit for to liue the vther for to be lovit. ?it hes this deuilshe dame of destanies ordanit That he sall lois baith lyfe and loue and schee a fay?full frende. Quherefoir all ?ee that heeris these amorous tragickt playes, Bestow on me ane world of plantes, on her a world of prais. 2a. [When Diophantus knew] When Diophantus knew The destinies Decreete, How he was forced to forgoe His deare and Lovely sweete, Ou'r volted with the vaile Of Beame rebeating trees And Ghostly gazeing on the ground Even death struck in his eyes, Oft pressed he to speake But when he did Essay The Agonizeing dreads of death His wrastling voice did stay. At last as one that strives Against both woe and shame Deare Charidora, ah, he cryes My high adored Dame, First I attest thy Name And then the Gods above But cheife of those the boy that beares The stately styles of love. Let those record with mee What was my constant part And if I did not honour thee With an well hallowed heart. I sacrafic'd to thee My secreete chast desires Vpon thy beauties Altar burnt With never quenching fyres. Thou was that Idoll still Whose Image I ador'd, The Saint to whom I made my vowes Whose pittyes I implor'd, The starr that sav'd my shipp From tempest of Dispaire When the Horizon of my hope Ov'r clouded was with care. Thou was that Soveraigne balme That sweete Cathalicon Which cured mee of all my cares When I did greive and grone, Though now such strange Events Are interveen'd since syne As I dare not avow to say Or thinke that thou are myne, Which makes mee thus insert In those my sorrowing songs The Histories of my misshapps, My miseryes and wrongs. Not that I can accuse My Charidora, noe I only execrate the Fates Cheife worker of my woe. Should she whome I have lov'd Soe many Loathsome yeares, For whome my due disstilling Eyes Have shedd such streames of teares, Should she I say be made A prey to such a one Who for her sake yet never gave Not one vntymely grone? Noe surely, surely noe The Fates may doe me wrong And make her by there badd decreete To whome they please belong, Yet dare I boldly say And peradventure vant That she is myne by lott of love Though luck in love I want, And though my Horiscope Invy my worldly things, Yet into love it gave mee leave For to compare with Kings. And if I knew there were Vnder the starry skie That durst avow to love my Dame More faithfully then I, I should teare out this heart Which Entertains my breath And cast it downe before her feete To dye a shamefull death. But since both time and she Have try'd mee to be true And found such faithfullness in mee As shall be found in few, I rest secure in this And cares not who pretend, The moe persue the more my part Proves perfect to the End, And others faithless faiths In ballance weigh'd with mine Shall make my faith for to triumph And as the Sunn to shine. There shall noe change of things, Of tyme, of soyle, of Ayre, Inforce mee to forgoe the vowes Made to my fayrest faire, Which here I doe renew In solemne forme againe To wittness as I did begin Soe shall I still remaine. I sweare by these two Eyes My only dearest deare, And by the Stygian stankes of hell Whereby the Gods did sweare. That thou are only she Whose countenance I crave And shall be both in life and death Thy best affected slave, That ther shall noe deceits Of lovely laughing eyne, Noe suggred sounds of Syren songs With farr fetch'd sighes betweene Deface out of my minde What love did soe ingrave Thy words thy lookes and such things Els As none but Angells have. And this which here I sweare And solemnly protest Those trees which only present are Shall wittness and attest, But cheif and above all This Holly sad and greene On which the Cyphers of our Names Charectered shall be seene. O happy happy Tree Into whose tender rynd The Trophies of our love shall live Eternally inshrin'd, Which shall have force to make Thy memory remaine Sequestrat from the Bastard sort Of Trees which are profane, For when with careless lookes The rest or'e past shall be Then thou shall be ador'd and kist For Charidoras tree. And peradventure too For Diophantus sake Some civill person that comes by Shall homage to the make. Thus blest shall thou remaine While I vnhappy prove And doubtfull where I shall be left When I shall leave my love. Indeede all is in doubt But this I must depart, The body must a Pillgrime be And she retaine the heart, The thought of which Exile And dolourous devorce Workes sorrow, sorrow, doth from me Those sadd complaints inforce. For while I was resolv'd To smoother vp my greife Because it might but move in men More marvaile then beleife, The never seasing frownes Of Malencountrous Fates Extorted those Abortive birthes Of importune regraits To wittness to the world That my misshapps are such Although I mourne like one halfe madd I cannot mourne to much. For if of all misshapps This be the first of all, To have bin highly happy once And from that height to fall, I'm sure I may well say That Diophantus Name Is the Synonyme of misshapps, Or els Exceedes the same. Or if there be no hell But out of Heaven to be, Consider what her want should worke Whose sight was such to mee. I thinke all those that speake Of sorrow should thinke shame When Diophantus shall be heard For Charidoras Name. Her worth was without spott, His truth was vnreprov'd, The one deserv'd at least to live The other to be lov'd. Yet hath the Divelish doome Of destinyes ordain'd That he should loose both life and love And she a Faithful freind. Wherefore all you that heares Those Amorous tragick playes, Bestow on him a world of plaints On her a world of praise. 3. Craiges passionado Quhy did the god's ordaine ane michtie monarchis mynde Vithin the presoun of my corps to be inclo'sd and pynde? Quhy did they predecree suche intestine debate, Suche euill weeris to be betuixe my calling and conceite? Giue as sum say there be ane transmigratioune thenn, Evin at sum princes fall or deat my balefull birth began, And as he dyit his saull and spirit hes flowin into me Quhilk maks my munting mynde so fare aboue my fate to flee. Yit doubt I giue or no my predecessoures gone That vmquhile prince hes iuster caus or I for to bemone. Hee pleanes perhaps because within a world so wylde His princelie and heroike thouchts suld daylie be defylde, I murne againe becaus my fonnde conceatid thoucht, Doune weyit allace be my wnworthe, resolues and turns to no?. Sine ane or bathe be plagued I cannoucht weell defyne, The punishement ma? weell be his, but all ye pane is myne. ?it thinke secuirelie think, tho thow be baslie borne, Suppois the schell be cast away ?et will the perle be worne. But heere ane freesche alarum my heart does now assaill To think and noucht reveele my tho?is me thinks cannot availl, For quhereto can they serve be they from her obscuired For quhom my present and my past displeasures I indured, Sen schee even lyke the foule quha liftes within her beake The schell fische heiche into the air that it may fall and breake, Sen schee I say hes heysit myne hearte aboue the skyes, Sall schoe not knaw quhat's in my mynde? I murmure and devyis. ?es surelie ?es but how, by word by wryte or baith Sall I reveell my hidin harmes my long conceillit skay?? By none of thois for quhy my rivell for I see Hes made ane dullfull interdyte betuix my dame and me. O happie happie he to liue in suche estaite, He come in tyme, curst be the tyme, allace I come to late. ?et let him beere with this, sence fanncie maks me fonde, He sall noucht loue her him allone and he hade sworne vpound. My richt's salbe als goode as heeis I sweere by Iove above, Altho? hee war me fare in lucke he wares me no? in love. He loues (allace) and findes In loue rewairde againe, I wate I loue alsweell as he and finds no thing but pane. I ade this meikle mair that breids my hart releif, Quhen schoe her bewtie doeth behold in glasses of my greif, My lynnes ma? schaw my loue, my loue may schow my pane, And schoe within my panes may spye her bewties force agane. For giue I soucht rewairde, schee wold replye, I knaw, It wer ane great disgrace to her for to descend sua law To loue or reaffect ane wretche ane puissante power, By birth and bloode Ignoble borne, inglorious and obscuire. ?et were it noucht eneuche I sould leive of to loofe Ore from the worlds miracle my mynde for to remove, All thinges againe deformed In chaos massd shalbe, Befoir ane retrospiciante I sall ceass from loving the. First let omeriane blacke eternall nicht ourvaill The earthis circumference befoir my fixit faithe sall faill. Thes monomathicke Iarris betuix my selff and the Out of my mynde sall nawa?es make my fixit Idea flee. My love quhere it is laid sall grow and floorishe greene, And suche apostasie in me at no tyme shalbe seene. For how cann I from love or from my thoughts refraine, And how can I but loue my thouchtes and thinke on love agane? Tuyse am I now reduceit to my pretendit theame, And giue my selffe, my tho?is or her I wate not quhat to blame. Giue her, I wer vnwise, or giue my thouchts or me, O thenn are na caus for a caus but caus sould quarrellit be. But ohe as sum alledge loue harboures aye the heart, There is na plague beneth the pole of quhilk I haue na pairt, And all the duillefull dintes that in despaire cann duell Conglomerat's in armes hudge my pleesures to expell. ?it giue as I haue saide ane transmigratioune be, Quhy doe noucht these my raging thouchts tak journey now &amp; flee, And seek sum saifer schoire quherein at large to fleit? For I haue deyed ten thousande deids sen they and I did meit. Wald god I anes had dyed, thenn hade my fanncies flede, But in suppoised death is lyfe by thoucht susteint and fed. Thenn sall I saye I liue or sall I saye I dee? I am noucht dead and giue I sould alledge I liue I lie. The babell of my mynde hes drevin me so awaye That, as I wate noucht quhat I think, I wate not quhat I saye. ?it weell I wate I love and ?it shee wates noucht this, Thus is wyteles of my woe and still bereav's my bless, Ane paradoxe I graunte, and ?it ane theame must trew Quhois certane groundes breeds surest greefes quhilk I canno? eschew. And ?it giue trew loue might trew loues rewarde obtene, Thenn weell I wote my waiting on wald not be wair't in vane. But while my sanct espyes in saddest songes my syte, Schee thinkes I haue na mynde of love but wryt's becaus I wryte. But ?et while schee on me for to conferre wald call, Oft haue I sworne by heavin and eirthe my mistres warrs them all, And oft have wee discouerit what, quhy, quhairefoir, and how I lou'd my dame, and oft wald schee baith love and all allow. ?et durst I not behold her to her self to schow, But thesawriz'd my hiddin harmes and ay conceallit woe, And as the fearefull babe quho knawes his task perqueir, And sett's the buike asyde befoir the appoynted hour draw neir, And ou'r and ou'r againe his leassoune doeth repeate, That hee may satisfie and pleis the maister quhen they meit, ?it quhenn ane compt is tane all fleis from out his tho?, And quhat he knew he quyte fore?et's, feir setts his mynde aflo?. Evin sua it faires with me, my harong clearlye cunde, Hes presence hes obliterate befoir I haue begunde. And oft have I determened my passiones to displaye, And ?it Immediatelie I weiping went awaye. O in my loveing lynes, O blind with brusit teares, Hes schee espyit my passiones strong, my stryving hop's &amp; feirs, Oft hes schoe sweetlye said, thy mistres were to blame, Gif cruell schee, to the that soe her praises doeth proclame. And ware thow myne, said schoe, I surelie wald be loath Thy loue, thy hoip, thy faithe sould finde or raip rewarde of wra?. Thus cannoucht I but thinke and half perswade my sell Schee knawes I love her best of all suppois I dare not tell. ?it leist my name sould be transsumpit heir and theire, Inrol'd with foolische soulls who feides on apprehensions bair, I schaipe with spidie haist to sett asyde all shame And by sum meanes to manifest my dule vnto my dame, Quhois must renouned name for me sall nevir be knowne, But in my mynde sall still rema?ne in bloodie figures drawne. So sall my loue to her, and with my love my paine, May ather by my presence be or poesie maid plaine. I cease regraiting still that wicked weirds hes wro? Suche annalogicke descrepaunce betuix me and my tho?, Quhilk maks me thus allace, but pietie to be pyn'd, Quhenn I beheld suche monsterous greit greefis w?in my mynd. And still sall I bewaill till thouchts there actions breid And mak ane ramigratioune there from quhence they did proceid. And sua till vengit tyme my wish'd contentment bring, I end and on ye heichts of hoip my hovering tho?is sall hing. 4. [Let not the world beleive] Let not the world beleive the' accursing of my fate, It endis to alluire and to condole with me my tragicte state, Nor that I have sent furthe these stormie teeris of rage So by disburding of my breast my sorrowes to assuage. No, no, that serves for noucht, I crave no suche releef, Nor will I ?eild that any sould be partiners of my greef. My fantassie to feid, I onlie spend thois teares My plaintes playes me, no musick sound's so sweetlie in my eares. I wish that from my birth I had acquanted beine Still with mishap's and never had but noyes and horrours seine, Thenn Ignoraunte of Ioyes, Lamenting as I doe, As thinking all menn did the lyke I micht content me to. But ohe my fate was worse, for it as in ane glas Schow me throw lytle blenkes of bles the state quherin I was, Quhich wnperfyted Ioyes, scairce constante for ane hour, Was lyke but to ane waterie soonne that schynnes befoir a scho?, For giue I euer thoucht or rather dreem'd of Ioyes, That lytle lichtning but foir shewde a thunder of annoyes. It was but lyke the fruite that tantalus tormentes, Quhich whill he sies and not attanes his hunger but augments, For sua the shaddow of that but Imaginit mirth Cald all the crosses to recoirde I suffered since my birth, Quhich are to be bewaill'd, but hard to be redressit, Quhois strange effect's may well be felt but cannot be exprest. Iudge what the feeling was whenn thinking on thinges past, I trimble at the torment ?it and stande ane tyme agast ?it doe I noucht repent, but will with patience pyne, For thoucht I murne, I murmure not lyke men yat doe repyne. I grante I waile my lote, ?it I approve her will, Quhat my saull oracle thinks gude I never sall think ill. Giue I had only sought ane salue to ease my paines, Long since I hade bewailled my lote alongst the illisian plaines. ?it mynde I noucht in this, selff louer lyke to dyee, As ane that cairt not for her lois so I my self wer free. No, may ten night's annoyes mak her ane nicht secuire, Ane day of dolour's vnto her ane momentes mirth procure, Ore may ane ?eeres lament's rejoyce her half ane hour, May seavin ?eir's sorrow's mak her glad, I sall not think them sour. And gif shee doeth delychte to heere of my deseeis, Thenn o, bleast I, quho soe ma? haue the occasioun her to pleas. For now the caus I liue is noucht for lufe of lyfe, But onlie for to honour her that holds me still in stryfe. And ore these vowes I make do vnperformit escaipe, This world sall anes agane renverst resoome her shaples shape, But what, what haue I vowed, my passiones wer too strong, As giue the myldest of the world delighted to doe wrong, As schee quhom I adoire with so devoite ane mynde Could rest content to see me sterve, be glade to see my pynde. No, no, schee wailles my state and wald appa?s my caires, ?et interdytit to the faites confirmes her will to ther's. Thenn O, vnhappie man, whom evin thyne sanct wold saue, And ?it thy crewell destanie doeth damne the to thy grave, This sentence thenn may serve for to confound my fear's, Quhy brust I not my breist with sighis and droune my eyes w? teirs? Ohe I haif murnit sa muche that I ma? murne no moir, My miseries pas numbring now, plaintes perisch in y? scoir. The meanes to vnloade my breast does quyte begin to faill, For being drunk with too much doole I wate not how to waill. And since I wante ane way my anguishe to reveell, Of force contented with my faite I'll suffer and conceell, And for to wishe the world evin as my Loue wish'd me, I vse ane countenance lyke to one quhois mynde from greif wer free. For quhenn shoe did disdaine, shee schew'd ane smylling face, Evin quhen that schoe denunc'd my dea?, schee sem'd to promeis grace. So sall I seeme in schaw my thoughtes for to repois, ?it in the centure of my saull sall shrow'd a world of woes. Thenn wofull breast and eyes ?our restles cours controule, And with na outward signes betraye ye anguishe of my soule. Eyes rayne ?our shoures within, arrouze ye eirth no moir, Pas doune with a deludge of tear's ye breast ?e burnd befoir. Breast arme ?our seelf with sigh's, giue ou'r waike to defend, Thenn perishe by ?our proper fyres and mak ane honest end. 5. Ane dyor [Evin as the dying swayne] Evin as the dying swayne almost bereft of breath Sound's dulefull songes and dririe not's, a presage of her dea?, Sua since my date of lyfe almost expyr'd I find My obsequeis I sadlie sing as sorrow toounes my mynd. And as the rairest bird ane pyle of woode doeth frame, Quhich being fyred by phebus rayes sche falls into ye flame, So by tuo sunnye eyes I giue my fanncies fyre And burne my self with bewties rayes evin by my awin desyre. Thus the angree gods at lenth begin for to relent, And anes to end my dathefull lyfe for pietie are content. For giue th'infernall poweris the dampned saulls wold pyne, Thenn let them send them to the light to leid a lyfe lyke myne. O giue I could receave the crosses and the cairs That from my cradle to my bear's conduct me w? despair's, Then hungrie tantalus pleas'd with his lote wald stand, I famishe for ane sweeter foode quhilk still rest's in my hand. Lyke Ixiones restles wheelle my fancies rule about, And Lyke a gwest that stolle heavins fyres they tare my bowells out. I worke ane endles taske and lois my labour still, Evin as the bloodye sisteris doe that emptie as they fill. As siciphus stone returnes his guiltie ghoist to appaill, I euer rais my hoip sua heiche they bruse me w? there fall. And giue I could in sume my seuerall greefes relate, All wold forget there proper harmes and onlye waill my state. So greivous is my paine, so panefull is my greef, That death whiche doeth the world affright wold ?eild me to releef. I haue mishaps sua lang as in ane habite hade, I think I luik not lyke my self but whenn that I am sade. As bird's that flee but in the aire, fishes in sea doe diue, Sua sorrow's lyke an element by which I onlie liue. ?it this may be admired as more then strange in me, Altho? in all my horoscope not one po?nt cleir I see. Aganest my knowledge ?it I manye a tyme rebell, And seek to gadder groundis of hoip ane hevin amids a hell. O poysonne of the mynde that doeth the wittes bereave And schrew'd it with ane cloake of loue does all ye world deceave, Thow arte the rock on whiche my comfoirtes schip didst dashe, It's thow that daylie in my woundes thy hookit heids does washe. Blind tyrante is, o thow by whome my hoip's lye deid, That whylls thraws furth a dert of gold, and whils a lumpe of leid. Thus oft thow woundes to, but in tuo differente states, Quhich treuth a strange antipathie, one loues the vther heats. O but I ere I graunte, I sould noucht the vpbraid, It's I to passiones tyrannie that haue my self betra?ed And ?it this cannoucht be, my iudgement aymes amiss, Ohe deere aurora it is thow that ruyn'd hes my bliss, Ane fault that by thy sex ma? pairtlie be excuised, Quhich still does lois quhat profer'd is affect's quhat is refuised. Quhills my distracted thoucht's I stryu'd for to controill, And with fain'd gestures did disguyis the anguishe of my soull, Thenn with inveiting lookes and accent's stampt w? loue The mask that was vpoun my mynde thow labourst to remove. And whenn that once ensnair'd thow in thois net's me spy'de, Thy smylles were shaddowit w? disdaines, thy bewties clo?hed w? pryde. To reateane thy grace I wate noucht how to goe, Sall I once fall befoir the feete to pleid for favour soe? No, no, I'le proudlie go, my wraith for to asswage And liberallie at last enlardge ye raines vnto my rage. I'le tell what wee were ones our chast (?it fervent) loue, Quhill in effect thow seam'd to affect ye which thow didst disprove, Quhill once to ingrave thy name vpoun a rocke I sate, Thow vowed to wryte myne in a mynde more firme by fare then y?. The marble stane then stampt reteanes that name of thyne, But, ah, thy moir then marble mynde it did not sua with myne. Sua that whiche thrallt me first sall set me free againe, Thois flames to which thy loue gave lyfe sall die with thy disdane. But ahe quhere am I now? how is my iudgement lost? I speik as it were in my power lyke ane that's free to boast. Haue I evin sauld my self to be thy bewties slaue, And quhen thow taks all hoip fra me, thow taks but quhat yow gave. That former loue of thyne did sua posses my mynde, That for to harbour vther tho?is, na roume remaynes behinde. The onlie meanes by which I mynde to avenge this wrong, It is by making of thy prais the bourding of my song. Thenn quhy sould thow suche spyte for my good will returne, Vas euer god as ?it sua made to make his temple burne? My breast the temple was quhence incens thow receaued, And ?it thow set's the same afyre which vtheris wald have saued. But why sould thow accuis aurora in this gyise? Shee's als fateles as schoe is fair, als Innocent als wyse. For it is but throuche my misluckt, giue anye fault yer be, For shee who was of nature mylde was cruell made by me. And since my fortoune is In Woe to be bewrapptt, I'le honour her as of befoir and hate my awin mishaptt. Her rigourous cours sall serue my loyell pairt to prove And as ane tuichstone for to trye ye vertew of my love, Quhich whenn her bewtie fades salbe als cleir as now, My constancie it salbe knowne when wrinckled is her brow, Sua that suche tua againe sall in no age be founde, Shee for her face, I for my fayth, boith worthie to be croun'd. 6. [Will thow, remorsles fair] Will thow, remorsles fair, still laughe whill I lament, And sall thy cheefe contentment be to see me mallecontent? Sall I narcissus lyke ane flying shade still chaise, Ore lyke pigmalion straine a stone quhilk bare no sence of gra[ce]? No, no, my blinde love now must burrow reassonnes eyes, It was thy fairnes made me fonnde, ?o? wrong mone mak me [wise]. My iust desert's disdaines to loue ane Loueles dame, The lyfe of cupidis fyre consistes Into ane mutuall flame [] gave thow but a looke, or gaue thow but a smyle, Ore sent thow furth but ane sweit siche My sorrows to begyle, My captiues thoucht's perhap's might be redeem'd from pane, And thois my mutineris maleconten's mycht freind's w? hoip agane But thow as it appear's, still cairles of my gude, And, as it seem's, wald eternize thy bewtie with my bloode, Ane great disgrace to the, to me ane monstrous wrong, Quhilk tyme will teache the to repent befoir that it be long. Then to prevente thy schame and to abraidge my woe, Because thow will noucht loue thy freinde, I'le cease to lufe m? foe. 6a. [Will thou, Remorsless faire] Will thou, Remorsless faire, Still laugh while I lament, Or shall thy cheife contentment be To see mee Malecontent? Shall I Narcissus like A flyeing shade still chase, Or like Pigmalion hugg a stone Which hath noe sense of grace? Noe, noe, my blinde love now Must borrow Reasons eyes, And as thy fairness made mee fond Thy wrongs must make mee wise. My Loyallty disdaines To love a Loveless Dame, The life of Cupids fyre consists Into a Mutuall flame. Hadst thou but given one looke, Or hadst thou given one smyle, Or hadst thou sent but one sweete sigh My sorrowes to beguyle, My Captive thoughts perchance Had been redeem'd from paine, And those my Mutinous discontents Made freinds with hope againe. But thou, I know not how, Are careless of my good And would ambitiously imbrue Thy beauty in my blood, A greate disgrace to thee, To mee a monstrous wrong, Which tyme would teach the to repent Before that it were long. But to prevent thy shame And to abridge my woe, Because thou cannot love thy freind, I'le cease to love my foe. 7. [Let him whois hapeles state] Let him whois hapeles state is as it aye hes beine, And hes bene euer as it is, ane cave caires to conteine, Still strampld doune with sturts, let him the weird's Imploir That they may fill his dayes with ?eir's nor ?eer's with dayes no moir. I clame no right to lyfe, tho' lyfe acclame to me, The comfoirt that my lyfe impoirt's Is that it liue to dye. ?it by constran'te of loue my pennance sall furth proue That tho' I doe not loue to liue, ?it doe I liue to love Her with whom I be ay, in absence present bee, Quhois matchles nevir deying worth I sall adoiring dye Giue then, ?ee plideris power of never purchast peace, Resigne my loue her awin disdaine, liue me with my disgrace, Tell to her secreete sight, since better could nocht bee, Lang haue I foughtin with my fate and now am forcit to flee. Sall never loue dissolue the lyfe that loue beganne. How lang sall langour be the lord, the louer be the man? The darkeest cloudes will cleir, ill storme will sumtyme ceas, And everie battell sum tyme hes ane day perfixt for peace. But where love lyis intrinch't within a breist of feares, Na kynde of comfoirt clair's there croce nor joy dryis vp y? teir's. Reid thenn, remorsles fair, quha knawes nor it ma? be That pittie, pittieles befoir, proue pittiefull to me. My tempted hee attempt's flew soiring out of sight, My mounting mynde did clume, allace, but came no? to ye hicht, Thy face, the field wherein my loue and thy disdaine, Vnreconceild compedito?is, vowes euer to remayne. Sen so it is allace, giue her gude nicht and goe, Devoirc't from weell, espousit to wrong, and interteinit w? woe. ?it nether contrair care nor prosperous event's Sall mak my pen leive of to blote the lynnis of my lament's. And for thy worth I vow In forrand lands to fair, Thy [inter]dyti[t] pilgr[i]me puire foreuer heir and thair. And as thow was that one to quhome I faith p[ro]fest, Looke in quhat corner of the eirth thy loouer po[o]re sall re[st]. There, be assuir't, sweet saull, som sonnet salbe sung, And sowst with sorrow for thy saik, cald with a tru[th]full tung. Had I als manie hearts as my harte thouchts [com]mands, And euerie hart of all these heart's I sweere als manye hands, Eache hand sould hold a pen to wryte thy worthie rair As post's of thy eternall prais to tell the world thour't fair. Let it suffice the pen, puire saull, her sicht to flee, Since thow hes founde thy marterdome remedyles to bee. Rest ?ee in thy wnrest, and murray be thow still, The maike where meneles miseries directes yere endles ill. Giue her ane long gudeny? and seeke vnto thy soir Sum hermitadge where broken herts are heipit vp in stoir, And there releefles dead vp gaue the ghoist and all That woorthie fame ma? fetche of thee, a fate memoriall, That as thow loueing liued her louer poore and trew, Sua at thy letter dying breathe, thow badd her last adew. Thus all thy ending bee begging vnto her prais, Her prais whilk never sall have end sall end my wretchit days. 8. [A Posy] Deire love, I am resolv'd with the to live, Tho with my smok thy pains fore to relive. Thus shoe replyed: Deir Sir if it be so, Without my smok, through a woreld with the I'le goe. 9. Wpon the possie of her woope and his Faire Lady, thy verteus be my guide, I doe resolve to live and die with yow. Sweet Sir, said shoe, if this yow doe resolve, Let me not ever be forgott by yow. 10. [A Declaration] My temperate style at first With Comick grones did greete, And though the Entrie seemed soure, The latest act was sweete. Now tragick trumpetts blowes, And sorrowing sounds out sought Vnto my Muses mourning mouth A wailing vayne hath wrought. Before alternant Ioyes Did promise some releife, Now care and love conspired in one Have sworne my Endless greife, Soe that I see noe soule Companion to my paines, Vnless it be those wretched ones Which Plutos raing retaynes. And yet they must confess My greefe there greefe exceedes, I suffer sakelessly, alas, But they for there missdeedes. And this much more I adde, The Rhodopean sounds Spent at Euridices fairwell Did mitigate there wounds, And when Alcmenas sonn The seidge to hell did lay, The prisoners of Plutos pitts Gott leave to take the play. But I since first I did This luckless love imbrace, I never felt, noe, not by dreame, The smallest glance of grace But cross came vpon cross, And cares convoyed with care, Sighes were companions to my teares, And danger of dispaire. I dyed and liv'd againe, I lived againe to dye, I dyed I know not what a death, A life it could not be. It could not be a life, Since that I had noe heart, And well I knowe it was noe death, Since that I felt my smart. It was then such a mids As takes part of the two, Or rather such as both the Extreames Doth vtterly missknowe. Noe, was it none of those, Noe, neither this nor that, For anything that I can see It was I knowe not what. I know not what it was, This knowledge much me greev'd, I know I was the vnhappyest hee That ever lov'd or liv'd. And thus remayning yet I glister and I glance, A patterne of vnhappyness, A mirrour of misschance, A Trophye which the Fates Erected have on high To testify the true triumphs Which they have gain'd ore mee. Yet blame I not the Fates For ought I doe sustaine, My greife is grounded vpon this That I dare not complaine. I neither dare nor will, I neither will nor may, I might if that I would, I would if that I durst assay. But to disclose my greefe Vnto my fatall foe, Methinkes it were the ready way For to aggredge my woe. Soe thus concealing't close My greife growes allwayes greate, The closer that the furnace is The sharper is the heate, And floodes are deepest there Where highest is the Damme, And Camamyle doth prosper best Where men tread downe the same. But yet I feare, alas, Or rather puts noe doubt, My fyerie rage is soe extreame Of force it must burst out. And soe I shall remaine A gazeing stock to be To such as will not creditt tayles Where Poets seemes to lye, Like to Typheus Rage Or girning Gorgons Ire, Such furious and Incensing spiritts Out thunders flaughts of fyre. Yet if I could indure Eternally as they, My state were more Miraculous I dare both sweare and say, But things too violent Cannot too long indure, My passions are soe excessive There owne End they'l procure. O happy thrice were I, If soe could mee befall As chanced to Mausoles Ashe Whose wife did drinke them all, But wishes are but vaine, Things runne soe to the worst In all my life, that after death I should be more at Rest. For who should promise mee A buriall att her heart When I am dead, who in my life Doth play mee Neroes part. That cruell Tyrant sett The seaven hill'd towne on fyre, And neither Eyes nor flinty heart At such a sight did tyre, But from his palace high He looked downe along And thinking on the seedge of Troy Hee burst out in a song, So she faire cruell she Whose lookes setts mee on fyre, Perceiving that my Modesty To speake dare not aspire, As it is Heritage Vnto that sex and sort, That seeing makes her not to see And laughs at such a sport. But since I dare not press Her cares for to acquainte With Tragedyes of my disstress And words of my complainte, I shall not cease to show The beale wherein I bide Vnto my wonted Secretaryes In whome I doe confide, The hills and Craigs I meane, The high and stately trees The valleyes low, the Mountains high Whose topps escapes our Eyes. And while I show't to them, The nearest Ayre shall hear't, The Ayre shall carry't to the fyre, The fyre to th'heavens shall bear't, The heavens shall lay't abroad Before the Gods above, And if they will not send releife, Farewell both life and love. 11. [A Protestation] My heart Exhale thy greife With an Eternall grone And never sease to sigh and mourne Till life or love begone. Thy life is crost with love, Thy love is loathed breath, Thou heats thyselfe to live such lyffe, A life even such is death. Resolve then one of two And patiently agrie Either to live a loveless life Or els to love and dye. But this thou canst not doe And that doth the but greive, Thou canst not live vnless thou love Nor love vnless thou live. Soe thou must live and love, Live wretched, love disgrac'd, Disgrac'd by her in whome thy life, In whome thy love was plac'd. O thrisse vnhappy heart, Of life and love forlorne! In what strange postures was the starrs The houre that thou was borne? Since then there bad aspects Did all conspire in one To make a man whose luck should be To be belov'd of none. And when they fram'd they saint, They did decree above That even her shaddow should infect A world of hearts with love. Of those, ah, thou was one, O that thou hadest not beene, But either had bin voyde of sense Or els depriv'd of eene. And yet I would not soe, Noe, noe, I wish that thou Had lov'd her many yeares agoe And seene her long ere now. For this I must confess, Although I live in strife, I count the first day of my love The first day of my life. If I had made a choice Of some vnworthy Dame, I might perchance have curst the Sunn That shyn'd to see the same. But since in the, my deare, Such rare perfections lye, As might make Cupid dye for love If he had Eyes as I, I must confess the truth Thy love bringes life to mee, And I esteeme him as starke dead That lives vnloving thee. I never was my owne But since I thought mee thyne, And I would thinke I had no heart If that my heart were myne. I sacrafic'd it once Vnto thy sacred Eyes, And aye since syne I thinke it lives Because for the it dyes. Now this to thee perchance A paradoxe doth prove, Yet none mistrusts such misteryes But Heriticks in love. Lov'd thou as well as I Thou would confess the same, But thou are not well purifyed With loves refyning flame. Thou takes as greate delight To murder with dissdaine, As others take delight to save An innocent vnslaine. And yet disdaine mee still, My soule shall still abide Content to saile the seas of love Against both winde and tyde, And ever while thy grace Some kinde of succours send, My sorrow shall be like my love Where it begon, its end. Soe shall I oblige the That thou shall either be The most ingrate that ever liv'd Or thou shall pitty mee, For soe resolv'd a love, And soe dispaird a paine, Might oblige stockes, might oblidge stones To pity mee againe. Behold while I did weepe The cloudes did melt in teares, The whispering windes to heare mee mourne Did change there mouthes in eares, Yea, even Appollos selfe Or'e vail'd his face for woe And thought it horrour to be hold A man tormented soe. Whilst thou still like thy selfe, Still cruell and vnkinde Did thinke it was thy beauties praise To see thy patient pind. But pitie, pitie now Not mine but thy disgrace And suffer not a Tigers heart To wrong an Angells face. Behold thou'rt faire, thou'rt wise, Thou'rt good, thou'rt all, what then If cruelty convert those gifts In monsters into men? Were thy perfections more As more they cannot be Since there infinitnes disdaines Both number and degree, Yet if they were not all At Clemencies command, They were but like a naked sword Put in a maddmans hand, For this is out of doubt, That who soe should the see, Should straight way love and loving straight Should thy poore Martyr be. I wishe not to be one That those adventures prove, I wish not to be Canoniz'd In Kallendars of love, Though my affections wings Might soe Ambitious be, Yet I beleive there is noe blanke Left in that booke for mee. I rather wish to live To testify my truth And by good service to deserve The recompense of Ruth. Yet if there be noe way To reconcile this strife But by the ruyne of my love Or shippwrack of my life, Content I am, sweet Nimph, Even with my dearest blood, To seale th'indenture of my death If that can doe the good. Mean whyle I live like one That waites for deaths decree And thinke that I shall gaine my life When I shall los't for the, For I attest t'the roundes That runn aboute above I rather dye for love of thee Then live for others love. Though my misshapp in love Might cause mee to disspayre, Yet hope assures mee thou art meeke As well as thou art fayre. Methought that in thyne Eyes There shynd some beames of grace, And may not love lodge in thy heart As well as in thy face? I will beleive the best And thinke that thou art myne As well as thou may safely say That I am only thyne. 12. [An Exhortation] If high Excess of Irrelenting smart Inforce not words to fayle, and thoughts to faint, My love would now convince both tongue and heart To say farewell vnto my sweetest Saint, But while affection would my woes reveale And say vnto my sweetest heart farewell, My senses are soe suffocat'd with care They sigh, they grone, then sayes nothing but faire. Then, fairest faire, read in my sighes and teares The secreete anguish of they dyeing slave, Who for the love vnto thy worth he beares Hath consecrat'd his soule vnto the Grave, And now is forc'd from thy dissdaines to goe Where death may End his never ending woe, Yet swearing still by all the lights above Ten thousands deaths shall never end his love. And thus resolv'd I only begg of the, Amidds my sadd Exile, this poore releife, That if thou cannot thinke with love on mee, Thou would with pitty pause vpon my grieffe, Or if perhapps this little seeme too much As, ah, I feare thy rigour shall be such That, when some freind my Name to minde shall call, Thou'll only sigh and wish mee well, that's all. 13. [Amintas] Amintas on a summer day To shunn Appollos beames Was dryving of his flocks away To tast some cooling streames, And through a Forrest as he went Neare to a River side, A voice which from a Grove was sent Invited him to bide. The voice well seem'd for to bewray Some male contented minde, For oft tymes did he heare it say Ten thousand tymes vnkinde. The remnant of that ragged mone Did all escape his eare, For every word brought forth a grone And every grone a teare. But nearer when he did repaire Both voice and face he knew, And see that Phillis was come there Her plaints for to renew. Soe leaving her to her complaint And murrmering ragged mones, He heard her fully discontent Thus all burst forth at once. Amintas, is my love to the Of such a small account That thou disdaines to looke on mee Or love mee as thou wont? Were those the Oathes that thou did make, The Vowes thou did Conceive, When I for thy Contentments sake My hearts delight did leave? How oft did thou protest to mee The Heavens should turne to nought, The sunn should first obscured be Or thou should change thy thought? Then Heavens dissolve without delay, Sunn show thy face noe more, Amintas love is lost for aye, And woe is mee therefore. Well might I if I had been wise Foreseene what now I finde, But too much love did seale myne eyes And made my Iudgement blinde. All thy behaviours were, god knowes, Too smooth and too discreete, Like sugar which impoyson'd growes Vnspy'd because it's sweete. Thy Oathes and vowes did promise more Nor well they could performe, Most like a calme which comes before An vnexpected storme. God knowes, it would not greive mee much For to be kill'd for thee, But, ah, how neare it doth me tuch That thou should murther mee. God knowes, I care not, for noe paine Can come for loss of breath, Its thy vnkindness, cruell swaine, That greives mee to the death. Amyntas, tell me, if thow may, If any fault of myn Hath giv'n the cause thus to betray My hearts delyt and thyn? No, no, alas, It could not be My loue to the was such, Vnles if that thow loathed me For loving the too much. But, ah, alas, what doe I gaine By those my fond complaints? My dolour doubles his disdaine, My greife his pride augments. Although it yeeld noe greater good, It oft doth ease my minde For to reproach the ingrattitude Of him who is vnkinde. With that her hand, Cold, wan, and pale, Vpon her breast she layed, And finding that her breath did faile She sight and then she sayed, Amintas; and with that, poore maid, She sight againe soe sore That after that she never said, Nor sight, nor breath'd noe more. 14. [Cloris and Amintas] Cloris, since thou art fled away Amintas sheep are gone astray, And all the Ioyes he took to see These pritie lambis run after the. She's gon, she's gon, and he all day Sings nothing now but walladay, walladay. The imbroidered scrip he us'd to wear Neglected hangs, so dooth his haire, His Crook is brook, doge whineing lyes, And he himself nothing but crys Cloris, O Cloris, come away, And heare Amintas walladay, walladay. His pipe wheron he us'd to play So oft to her a roundelay Is cast aside &amp; not an Swane Darr's pipe or play vpon that plain. It's death for any one to say One word to him but walladay, walladay. The may pole where her prettie feet In their dew measures oft did meet Is braken doun &amp; no content Com's neir Amintas since she went, But all that ever I heard him say Was Cloris, Cloris, walladay, walladay. The ground wheron she us'd to tred He ever since hath layed his head, And suffered ther such pining woe That not on blad of grass do grow. O Cloris, Cloris, come away, And hear Amintas walladay, walladay. 15. [Sonnet: On Hope] You hopes, you Bankerouts of tyme and youth, You shaddowes which Cephisus sonne did chase, You fruites which fledd from Tantalus hungry mouth, Goe hence from mee and take your dwelling place [] With such Camelions as can live on Aire, With such as buy into there owne disgrace Thurinus' smoake for good and solid ware. For me, I rather cherish true dispaire Then entertaine such hopes as doe betray mee, For mee, I rather stoupe to such a care As cutts mee shorte, then such as doth belie mee, A hopeless life is Arm'd against all paine, It doubleth greife to hope and not t'obtaine. 16. [To M?? Margaret Lesly Thereafter Lady of Madertie] Religious relicts of that ruinous place, Which sometymes gloryed in the glore of saints, Now hath noe glore but one whereof it vants, That one Saints beauty makes it heaven of grace, In balmie feildes which fairds her flourie face With sweete perfumes of Cornes, of trees, of plants, While Neptune swells with pride, when there he hants, And laughs for Ioy such beauty to Embrace, Beare me record, that while I passed by I did my dut'ous homage to your Dame, How thryce I sight, thrice on her name did cry, Thrice kist the ground for honour of the same Then left those lynes to tell her on a tree That she made them to live and mee to dye. 17. [Sonnet: Love's Provocation] Vnhappy eyes, why did you gaze againe Vpon those Fatall, Loveing, fyring Spheires, Know you not well, her fire flaughts would constraine Your Cristall circles to dissolve in teares? And you againe, even as vnhappy eares, Why did her painted Phrase your Fort surprise? Know you not well that in her lipps she beares A charming host of perswasive replyes? Oh, eyes and eares, that you had been more wise And had not waken'd vp a sleeping flame! Yet since the fault is don, my comfort lyes Into the merritts of a Matchless dame, For who soe loves her not, that heares or sees, Is neither worthy to have eares nor eyes. 18. A Sonnet Left in A Gentlewoman's Looking Glasse To veiw thy beauty well, if thou be wise, Come not to gaze vpon this glass of thyne, But come and looke vpon these Eyes of myne Where thou shalt see thy true resemblance twyce, Or if thou thinkes that thou profaines thy Eyes, When on my wretched eyes they daigne to shyne, Looke on my heart wherein, as in a shryne, The lively picture of thy beauty lyes, Or if thy harmeless Modesty thinkes shame To gaze vpon the horrours of my heart, Come read those lynes, and reading see in them The Trophies of thy beautie and my smart, Or if to none of those thou'l daigne to come, Weepe eyes, breake heart, and you my verse be dumbe. 19. [Sonnet: The Power of Love] Can Eagles birds fly lower then there kinde, Or can Ambition stoope to servile gaine? Can free borne breasts be forc'd against there minde To put the Maske of love vpon dissdaine? Can love be bought, can Avarice constraine Greate Cupid to do homage vnto gold, Can he his wings, can he his flames restraine, Or be induced to wishes worldlings would? Noe, noe, my fates are in the Heavens inrold, Mens lawes may force my life, but not my love, Men may my eyes, but not my heart, behold, My eyes may thers, my heart my owne shall prove. And ere I change, by t'heavens I vow to leave A Ioyles bedd, and take a joyfull Grave. 20. [Sonnet: The Second Scene of Baptista Guarini his Pastor Fido, Paraphrased] Faire cruell Silvia, since thou scornes my teares And over lookes my cares with careless Eye, Since my request in love offends thy eares, Hence forth I vow to hold my peace and dye. But while I hold my peace, those things shall cry, The brookes shall murmur and the winds complaine, The hills, the Dales, the Deserts where I lye With Echhoes of my sighes shall preach my paine. Yet put the Case they silent would remaine,— Imagine Brookes and windes should hold ther peace, Say that hills, vailes, and deserts would disdaine T'acquaint thy deafe disdaines with my disgrace, Yet when they dumbe, thou deafe to me shall prove, My death shall speake and let the know my love. 21. [Sonnet: De Porcheres On the Eies of Madame la Marquise de Monceaux, englished] Were those thine Eyes or Lightnings from above Whose glorious glimpses dazled soe my sight? I tooke them to be lightnings sent from Iove To threaten that his thunderbolt would light. Yet Lightnings could not be soe long soe bright, They rather seem'd to be some sunns, whose rayes, Promoved to the Meridian of there hight, Did change my noisome nights in Ioyfull dayes. Yet even in that there Number them betrayes, Sunns were they not, the world indures but one, There force, their figure, and their Coulor sayes That they were heavens, yet heavens on Earth are none. What ere they were, my sight noe odds espyes Twix't heavens, Twix't sunns, twixt lightnings &amp; thine eyes. 22. [Sonnet: Farewell to Life and Love] I bid farewell into the world and thee, To the, because thou art Extreame vnkinde, Vnto the world, because the world to me Is nothing, since I cannott move thy minde. Were any mercy in thy soule inshrin'd, Could sighes or teares make soft thy flinty heart, I could perhapps more easily be inclin'd To spend my dayes with the then to depart. But since thou knowes not Cupids golden dart, But hath been wounded with a shaft of lead, It is but folly to pretend his Art To sue for favour, when I find but feade. Soe farewell, Nimph, farewell for aye as now, And wellcome death more mercifull then thou. 23. [Sonnet: On Loss] Loe how the Sailer in a stormy night Wailes and complaines, till he the starr perceive Whose situation and assured hight Should guide him through the strong and watrie Cave. As many motives, wretched soule, I have For to regrat, as few for to rejoyce In seeing all things, once this sight I crave, Since I the Loadstare of my life did loose. And which is worse, amids those many woes, Amidds my paines which passes all compare, Noe helpe, noe hope, noe comfort, noe repose Noe sunn appeares to cleare those clouds of care, Save this, that fortune neither may nor dare Make my misshapps more hapless then they are. 24. [Sonnet: On the River Tweed] Faire famous flood, which sometyme did devyde, But now conjoynes, two Diadems in one. Suspend thy pace and some more softly slyde, Since wee have made the Trinchman of our mone. And since non's left but thy report alone To show the world our Captaines last farewell That courtesye I know when wee are gon Perhapps your Lord the Sea will it reveale. And you againe the same will not conceale, But straight proclaim't through all his bremish bounds, Till his high tydes these flowing tydeings tell And soe will send them with his murmering sounds To that Religious place whose stately walls Does keepe the heart which all our hearts inthralls. 25. To Queen Anne upone New-year's-day 1604 Madam, Who knoues your greatnes cannot but with fear Draw near your Alters to maike offerings there, But whoso knows your goodness may make bold, And with a mytte, as with a myne of gold, Alse confidently sacrifise to yow. And this is it that most plead pardon now, Both for the poornes of my giftis and lines. Princes ar gods, gods laughs to see their shrynes Adorned with any gift but of that kynd That Irus may as weel as Cresus find. They know how worldlings personat their pairts And maske with gold presents with leaden hearts. They know how gifts at court are but a train To steall from great ons tuice alse good againe. Now I have no such end, my poor oblation, At this auspicious time of salutation, Had it a tongue, this only wold it say: Heavens heape upon yow many a New-year's-day. 26. To the Author of the Monarchicke Tragedies Well may the programme of thy Tragick stage Inuite the curious pompe-expecting eies, To gaze on present shewes of passed age, Which iust desert Monarchick dare baptize. Crownes throwne from Thrones to tombes, detomb'd arise To match thy Muse with a Monarchick theame; That whilst her sacred soaring cuts the skies, A vulgar subiect may not wrong the same: And which giues most aduantage to thy fame; The worthiest Monarch that the Sunne can see, Doth grace thy labours with his glorious Name, And daignes Protector of thy birth to be: Thus all Monarchick, Patron, subiect, stile, Make thee, the Monarch-tragick of this Ile. Robert Ayton. 27. To the Author [of The Poeticall Essayes, Alexander Craig] Why thought fond Grece to build a solid fame, On fleeing shades of fables passing vaine? Why did her selfe-deceauing fansie dreame, That none but shee, the Muses did maintaine? She sayd, these sacred Sisters did remaine Confin'd within a Craig which there did lie, That great Apollo selfe did not disdaine, For that rough Palace, to renounce the skie: That there a Well still drawne, but neuer dry, Made Lay-men Poets eir they left the place: But all were ta'ls, which Fame doth now bely, And builds vp Albions glore, to their disgrace. Lo here the CRAIGE, whence flow's that sacred Well, Where Phoebus raigns, where all the Muses dwell. Ro. Aytone. 28. To the most worshipfull and worthy Knight, Sir Iames Hay, Gentleman of his Maiesties Bedchamber When Ianus keys vnlocks the gates aboue, And throwes more age on our sublunar lands, I sacrifice with flames of feruent loue These hecatombs of kisses to thy hands: Their worth is small, but thy deserts are such, They'l passe in worth, if once thy shrine they tuch. Laugh but on them, and then they will compare With all the haruest of th'Arabian fields, With all the pride of that perfumed aire Which winged troupes of musked Zephirs yeelds, When with their breath th'embalme the'Elisian plaine, And makes the floures reflect those sents againe: Yea they will be more sweet in their conceat Then Venus kisses spent on Adons wounds; Then those wherewith pale Cynthia did entreat The louely Shepheard of the Latmian bounds; And more then those which Ioues Ambrosian mouth Prodigaliz'd vpon the Troian youth. I know they can not such acceptance finde, If rigor censure their vncourtly frame, But thou art courteous, and wilt call to minde Th'excuse which shields both me and them from blame, My Muse was but a Nouice into this And being Virgin scarse well taught to kisse. Your most addicted Robert Ayton. 29. Vpon the: 5: ?? of November The mighty Mavors, jealous to behold A Mars more mighty nor himselfe below, Did once resolve his Rivall to Ore'throw By assassins whome open force made bold. But finding there that open force did fold Vnder the Princely valour of his foe, Hee then determin'd to assayle him soe As noe defence should his offence withhold. Thus comes he downe to Plutoes pale abode, And there for fyre and Brimstone straight doth call, Where with he thinkes to play the thundering God, And make the world admire his Ryvall's fall. But sease, fond Mars, to make the world to wonder, Ten thousand Lawrells save's our Mars from thunder. 30. To King James Where Thebes staitely Towres did threat the skye And overlooke the fertile Pharian land, There Memnons statue all of stone did stand And challenge wonders of each gazeing Eye, For of it selfe noe sense in it was found, Noe breath, noe Motion, nor noe life at all, But when Appollos beames vpon't did fall, Then it sent out a vitall vocall sound. I am that statue, greate and mighty King, Thou are that Phebus who with rayes of love Did make mee both to breath to live and move, When of my selfe I was sensless thing. Then, gratious sunn, still shyne and with those rayes Still give him life, who still shall give the praise. 31. [Vpone King James] The old Records of annalized fame Confirmes this wonder with the worlds assent, That once that Ile which Delos height by name In Neptun's bosome like a pillgryme went. After, when greate Appollo was content To grace it with the bliss of his birth day, Then those inconstant Motions did relent And it began to rest, to stand, and stay. Delos, while I admire the, I must say, In this our Albion may with the compare, Before our Phebus birth we were a prey To civill motions, tossed here and there, But since his Birthstarr did oreshine our state, Wee stand secure, redeem'd from all debate. 32. [On Devotion] My fairs vnkinde, and I have spent my paines And purchast nothing but vndew disdaines. O had she bin as kinde as I was true, What praise to her, Ioyes had to mee been due? But to my griefe and her disgrace I finde That faire ones too much lov'd prove seldom kinde. What then, shall loveing less be my revenge? O Noe, I wrong my Iudgement if I change. The dice are cast and lett her loath or love I may vnhappy, not Inconstant prove, For it is as impossible to mee To love her less, as more in love to bee. 33. [Wpone Tabacco] Forsaken of all comforts but these two, My faggott and my Pipe, I sitt and Muse On all my crosses, and almost accuse The heavens for dealing with me as they doe. Then hope steps in and with a smyling brow Such chearfull expectations doth infuse As makes me thinke ere long I cannot chuse But be some Grandie, whatsoever I'm now. But haveing spent my pype, I then, perceive That hopes and dreames are Couzens, both deceive. Then make I this conclusion in my minde, Its all one thing, both tends vnto one Scope To live vpon Tobacco and on hope, The ones but smoake, the other is but winde. 34. TO HIS DEAR FRIEND, AND fellow student M?. Robert AEton Sing swift hoof'd Æthon to thy matchles selfe, And be not silent in this pleasant spring: I am thy Echo, and thy Aerie elf, The latter straines of thy sweet tunes I'll sing: Ah, shall thy Muse no further frutes forth-bring, But Basia bare, and wilt thou write no more To higher notes, J pray thee tune thy string: Be still admir'd as thou hast bene of yore, Write Æthon writ, let not thy vain decay, Least we become Cymerians dark, or worse. If Æthon faill, the Sun his course must stay, For, Phœbus Chariot laks the cheefest horse: Thogh Fortun frown, ah, why should vertue die, Sing Æthon sing, and J shall Echo thee. 34. AETHON Cragio Svo Fane wold I sing, if songs my thoghts culd ease, Or calme the tempest of my troubled mynde: Fane wold J force my silent Muse to please, The gallant humor of thy wanton vane: But O a miser mancipat to paine, Sould slaue to sorrow, wedded to mischief, By mirth of songs, perhaps more greefe might gane, Jn vane of them J would expect releif: Then sacred Craig if thou wold ease my greef, Jnvite me not to wantonize with thee: But tune thy notes vnto my mourning cleif, And when J weepe, weepe thou to Echo mee. Perhaps the teares that from a Craig shall floe, May proue a Soveraigne balme to cure my woe. 35. To his coy Mistres What vthers doth discourage and dismay Is vnto me a pastime and a play. I sport in hir deneyalls and doe know Weman loue best that does loue least in show. Tuo sudden fauo?? may abate delight; When modest coynes sharpes the appetite, I grow the hotter for hir cold neglect And more inflam'd when sho showes least respect. Heat may aryse from rocks, from flints so fyre, So from hir coldnes I doe strik desyre. Sho knoweinge this, perhapes, resolues to try My faith and patience, offeringe to denay What e're I aske of hir, that I may be More taken with hir, for hir slightinge me. When fishes play with baites, best, anglers say, To mak them bite, is drawe the baite away; So dallies sho w? me till, to my smart, Both bait and hooke stickes fastened in my hart. And now I am become hir foolishe prey; And, that sho knowes I cannot break away, Let hir resolue no longer to be free From Cupides bondes, and bind hir self to me; Nor let hir wex me longer w? dispair That they be crewell that be younge and fair. It is the old, the creased, and the blake That are vnkynd and for affectione lacke. I'le ty hir eyes w? lynes, hir eares w? moanes Hir marble hart, I'le pearce w? hydious groanes That nather eyes, eares, hart sall be at rest Till sho forsaike hir sier to loue me best; Nor will I raise my seige nor leaue my feild Till I haue mead my waliant Mistres yeeld. 36. [A Song] [There is none, noe none but I] There is none, noe none but I, None but I soe full of woe, That I cannot chuse but dye Or els begg Physick from my foe. Now what hopes she shall be moved To revive my hopes forlorne, She that loves for to be lov'd, Yet payes her lovers hopes with scorne, Whose deserts inflames desire, Whose disdaines strikes comfort dead, In whose eyes lyes all loves fyre, From whose heart all love is fledd. Lovely eyes and Loveless heart, Why doe you soe disagree? How can sweetness cause such smart Or smarting soe delightful be? Noe, fair eyes, noe, noe more soe Cruell eyes and full of guile, You are only sweete in show And never kill but when you smile. Yet, faire eyes, this I must say, Though you should be still vnkinde Hee whose heart is not your prey Must either be a foole or blinde. 37. [A Valediction] Then will thou goe and leave me here? Ah doe not soe my dearest deare. The sunns departur clouds the sky But thy departure makes mee dye. Thou canst not goe but with my heart, Even that which is my cheifest part, Then with two hearts thou shall be gone And I shall rest behinde with none. Prevent the danger of this ill, Goe not away, stay with mee still, Ile bath thy lipps with kisses then, Expecting increase back againe. And if thou needes will goe away, Ah, leave one heart with mee to stay, Take myne, Let thine in pawne remaine That thou will quickly come againe. Mean tyme, my part shall be to Mourne, To tell the houres till thou returne, My eyes shall be but eyes to weepe And neither eyes to see nor sleepe. And if perchance there lidds I close To ease them with some false repose, Yet still my longing dreames shall be Of nothing in the world but the. 38. [The Sheppherd Thirsis] The sheppherd Thirsis long'd to die Gazeing vpon the gratious eye Of her whome he ador'd and lov'd, When she, whome no less passion mov'd, Thus said, O die not yet I pray I'le dye with the if thou will stay. The sheppherd then a while delayes The hast he had to end his dayes, And while thus Languishing he lyes, Sucking sweete Nectar from her eyes, The lovely Sheppherdess, who found The harvest of her love att hand, With trembling eyes, straight falls a crying Die, die sweete heart, for I am dyeing. The sheppherd then did straight reply, Behold sweete heart with the I dye. Thus did those lovers spend there breath In such a sweete and deathless death, That they to life reviv'd againe, Againe to try deaths pleasant paine. 39. [An Epigram] Philo lov'd Sophia and she againe Did pay him home with coy disdaine. Yet when he dye'd, he left her all he had. What doe you thinke? the man was mad. 40. [A Song] [O that my tongue had been as dumbe] O that my tongue had been as dumbe As now I finde My eyes were blinde When they did make my heart become A vottary vnto a Saint That hath noe eares to my complaint. Had I but made my eyes my tongue, My very lookes Had serv'd for bookes Wherein she might have read her wrong, But now my words as charmes she feares And serpent like doth shutt her eares. Yet who would not have cry'd for ayd, Burnt to the quick? A senseless stick To Vulcans tyrranny betrai'd Will wast itself in moyst expence, And keepe a noyse as if't had sense. Speake then must I though to noe end, For love doth say That silence may Much more then freindly speech offend, Love once profess'd and then forborne Turns deafe neglect to spightfull scorne. 41. Vpon a Diamond cutt in forme of an hart sett with a Crowne above and a bloody dart peirceing it sent in a Newyeares gift Thou sent to mee a heart was Crown'd, I thought it had been thine, But when I saw it had a wound, I knew the heart was mine. A bounty of a strange conceite To give myne owne to mee And give it in a worse Estate Then it was given to thee. The heart I sent, it had noe paine, It was intyre and sound, But thou did render 't back againe Sick of a deadly wound. O Heavens, how would you vse a heart That should Rebellious be, When you vndoe it with a dart That yeildes itselfe to the? Yet wish I it had noe more paine Then from the wound proceedes, More for the sending back againe Then for the wound it bleedes. Envy will say some missdesert Hath caus'd the turn't away, And where it was thy fault, thy Art The blame on it will lay. Yet thou does know that noe defect In it thou couldst reprove, Thou only fear'd it should infect Thy loveless heart with love, A crime which if it could committ Would soe indear't to thee, That thou would rather harbor it Then send it back to mee. Yet keepe it still, or if, poore heart, It hath been thine to long, Send mee it back as free from smart As it was free from wrong. 42. [Vpone a Gentlewoman That painted] Pamphilia hath a number of good parts Which Commendation to her worth imparts, But amongst all, in one she doth excell, That she can paint incomparablie well, And yet soe Modest, that if prais'd for this, She'll sweare she does not know what painting is, But straight will blush with such a portred grace That one would thinke Vermillion dyed her face. One of her pictures I have oft tymes seene And would have sworne that it her selfe had beene, But when I bid her it on mee bestow, I sweare I heard the Pictur's selfe say noe. What thinke you this a Prodigie? Its none, The painter and the picture were both one. 43. Vpon Love There is no worldly pleasure here below Which by experience doth not folly prove, But amongst all the follyes that I know, The sweetest folly in the world is love But not that passion which with fooles consent Above the reason beares Imperious sway, Makeing there lifetime a perpetuall Lent, As if a man were borne to fast and pray. Noe, that is not the humour I approve As either yeilding pleasure or promotion, I like a milde and Lukewarm zeale in love, Although I doe not like it in Devotion For it hath noe Coherence with my Creed To thinke that Lovers dye as they pretend, If all that say they dye had dyed indeed, Sure long ere now the world had had an end. Besides wee neede not love vnless wee please, Noe destinye can force mans disposition, And how can any dye of that disease Whereof himselfe may be his owne Physitian? But some seemes soe distracted of there witts That I would thinke it but a veniall sinn To take some of those Innocents that sitts In Beddlam out, and put some lovers in. And some men rather then incurr the slander Of true Appostates will false Martyrs prove, But I am neither Iphis nor Leander Ile neither drowne nor hang my selfe for love. Methinks a wisemans actions should be such As allwayes yeildes to reasons best advise, Now for to love too little or too much Are both Extreames, and all extreames are vice. Yet have I been a lover by report, Yea, I have dyed for love as others doe, But, prais'd be God, it was in such a sort That I revived within an houre or two. Thus have I liv'd, thus have I lov'd till now, And findes noe reason to repent mee yet, And whosoever otherwise will doe, His courage is as little as his witt. 44. [On Love] Lov's like a game at Irish where the dye Of maids affection doth by fortune fly, Which, when you thinke you certaine of the same, Proves but att best a doubtfull aftergame. For if they finde yoar fancy in a blott, Its two to one If then they take you nott. But, being Gamesters, you must boldly venter, And wher you see the pointe lye open, enter. Beleive mee one thing, Nothing brings about A game halfe lost soe soone as holding out. And next to holding out, this you shall finde, There's nothing worse then entering still behinde. Yet doth not all in happy entrance lye, When you are on, you must throw home and hye. If you throw low and weake, beleive mee then, Doe what you can, they will be bearing men, And if you looke not all the better on, They will play false, beare two instead of one. 45. [A Songe: On his Mistresse] Deare, why doe you say you love, When indeede you careless prove? Reason better can digest Earnest heate, then love in Iest. Wherefore doe your smileing eyes Helpe your tongue to make sweete lyes? Leave to Statesman tricks of State, Love doth Politicians heate. You perhapps presume to finde Love of some Camelion kinde, But be not deceiv'd, my faire, Love will not be fedd on Ayre. Lov's a glutton of his food, Surfeit makes his stomack good. Love whose dyett growes precise Sick of some Consumption dyes. Then, deare love, lett mee obtaine That which may true love maintaine, Or if kinde you cannot prove, Prove true, say you cannot love. 46. [A Song] [What meanes this Nyceness now of late] What meanes this Nyceness now of late Since tyme doth truth approve? Such distance may well stand with State, It cannot stand with love. Its either cunning or distrust That doth such wayes allow, The first is base, the last's vnjust, Let neither blemish you. If you intend to draw mee on, You over act your part, And if you meane to send me gon, You neede not halfe this Art. Speake but the word, or doe but cast A looke which seemes to frowne, I'le give you all the love that's past, The rest shall be my owne. And such a faire and Efald way On both sides none can blame, Since every one is bound to play The fairest of his game. 47. [The Rejection] Shall feare to seeme vntrue To vowes of constant duty Make mee disgest disdaines vndue From an inconstant beautie? Noe, I doe not affect In vowes to seeme soe holy That I would have the world to check My constancy with folly. Let her call breach of vow What I call just repentance, I count him base and braine sick, too, That dotes on Coy acquaintance. Thus if out of her snaire At last I doe vnfold mee, Accuse her selfe that caught mee there And knew not how to hold mee. And if I Rebell prove Against my will I doe it, Yet can I heate as well as love When reason binds mee to it. 48. [Vpon his unconstant Mistress] Why did I wrong my Iudgment soe As to affect where I did know There was noe hold for to be taken? That which her heart thirsts after most, If once of it her hope can boast, Straite by her folly is forsaken. Thus while I still persue in vaine, Methinkes I turne a childe againe And of my shadow am a chaseing, For all her favours are to mee Like apparitions which I see, Yet never can come neare th'imbraceing. Oft have I wish'd that there had beene Some Almanack whereby to have seene When love with her had beene in season, But I perceive there is noe Art Can finde the Epact of a heart That loves by chance and not by reason. Yet will I not for this dispaire, But time her humour may prepare To love him who is now neglected, For what vnto my Constancy Is now deny'd, one day may be From her Inconstancy expected. 49. [Constancy: A Song] When thou didst thinke I did not love, Then thou didst dote on mee, Now when thou findst that I doe prove As kinde as kinde can bee, Love dyes in thee. What way to fyre the Mercurie Of thy Inconstant mynde? Methinkes it were good policie For mee to turne vnkinde To make the kinde. Yet will I not good nature strayne To buy at soe greate cost, That which before I did obtaine I make accompt almost That it is lost. And though I might my selfe excuse By Imitateing the, Yet will I noe examples vse That may bewray in mee Lightness to bee. But since I gave the once my heart, My constancy shall show That though thou play the womans part And from a freind turne foe, Men doe not soe. 50. [Neglect of Love] I lov'd the once, I'le love noe more, Thyne be the greife as is the blame Thou art not what thou was before What reason I should be the same? Hee that can love vnlov'd againe Hath better store of love then braine. God send mee love my debts to pay While vnthrifts fooles there love away. Nothing could have my love o'rethrowne If thou had still continued myne, Nay, if thou had remain'd thine owne, I might perchance have yet been thyne, But thou thy freedome did recall That it thou might Elswhere inthrall, And then how could I but disdaine A Captives Captive to remaine? When new desires had Conquer'd thee And chang'd the Object of thy will, It had been Lethargie in mee, Noe constancy to love the still, Yea, it had been a sinn to goe And prostitute affection soe, Since wee are taught noe prayers to say To such as must to others pray. Yet doe thou glorye in thy choice, Thy choice of his good fortune boast, I'le neither greive nor yet rejoice To see him gaine what I have lost. The hight of my disdaine shall bee To laugh at him, to blush for thee, To love the still, but goe noe more A begging at a beggers dore. 51. The Answer, by the Author [at the King's Majesty's Command] Thou that lov'd once now loves noe more For feare to show more love then braine, With Heresye vnhatch'd before Apostasie thou doest maintayne. Can he have either braine or love That doth Inconstancy approve? A choice well made no change admitts, All changes argue afterwitts. Say that shee had not been the same, Should thou therefore an other bee? What thou in her as vice did blame, Can that take vertues name in thee? Noe, thou in this her Captive was And made the ready by her glass, Example ledd revenge astray, When true love should have kep't the way. True love hath noe reflecting end, The object, good, setts it at rest, And noble breasts will freely lend Without expecting Interest. Tis merchant love, tis trade for gaine To barter love for love againe, Tis vsury, yea worse then this, For selfe Idolatrie it is. Then lett her choice be what it will, Lett constancy be thy revenge, If thou retribute good for ill Both greife and shame shall check her change. Thus mays't thou laugh when thou shall see Remorse reclaime her home to thee, And where thou beggst of her before, She now sitts begging at thy doore. 52. Vpon M? Thomas Murrays fall The other night from Court returning late, Tyr'd with attendance, out of love with state, I mett a boy who ask't if he should goe A long to light mee home, I told him noe. Yet he did vrge the darkness of the night, The foulness of the way requir'd a light. Its true, good boy, quoth I, yet thou mayst be More vsefull to some other then to mee. I cannot miss my way, but they that take The way from whence I came, have neede to make A light there guide, for I dare boldly say Its ten to one, but they shall lose there way. 53. Vpon Prince Henry his death to Prince Charles Admired Phoenix, springing vp a pace From th'Ashes of another Phoenix bones Which, too, too courteous, yeelded the his place, Least Earth were burthen'd with two birds at once Of that rare kinde which loves to live a lone, Whose only Essence is to be but one. 54. On y? Princes death, to y? King Did you ever see the day When Blossomes fell in middst of May? Rather, did you ever see all y? Blossomes on the Tree grow to ripe fruit? some must fall, Nature sayes so, though not all. Though one be fallen, we have store, the Tree is fresh, &amp; may have more. And for o? comfort this we know, the soyle is good, and you may sowe. What would we more? more seed cast on, for so have thriving husbandes done. And though y? first Cropp fayle, they find a fruitfull earth will still be kind; And, sir, yo? patience is but Iust, for live we may but dye we must. But this way y? first? tis true God shouldbe first serv'd, then you. He that made y? Sun to shine said, the first fruit shalbe mine. And thinke it not a heavy doome, for he that gives all, may take some. Godes will is done, and yet to you his will ordeynes a Blessing too. A man begettes a man, the king did more, begatt a holy thing; An Angell, that nere knew offence, such priviledge hath Innocence. The king then cannot make Complaynt when y? kinges first borne is a Saint; Nay more, an Angell, heavenly blesst, so let our heavenly Angell rest. 55. Vpon Platonick Love: To Mistress Cicely Crofts, Maide of Honor O that I were all soule that I might prove For you as fitt a love As you are for an Angell, for I vow, None but pure spiritts are fitt loves for you. You'r all Etheri'all, there is in you noe dross Nor any part that's gross, Your coursest part is like the curious lawne O're Vestall Relicts for a covering drawne. Your other part, part of the purest fire That e're Heaven did inspire, Makes every thought that is refined by it A Quintessence of goodnes and of witt. Thus doe your raptures reach to that degree In loves Phylosiphy That you can figure to your selfe a fyre, Void of all heate, a love without desire. Nor in divinity doe you goe less, You thinke and yow profess That soules may have a plenitude of joy, Although there bodyes never meete t'Enjoy. But I must needes confess I doe not finde The motions of my minde Soe purifyed as yet, but at there best My body claims in them some interest. I hold a perfyt Ioy makes all our parts As joyfull as our hearts, My senses tell me if I please not them My love is butt a dottage or a dreame. How shall wee then agree? you may descend, But will not to my end. I faine would tune my fancy to your key, But cannot reach to that abstracted way. There rests but this, that, while wee sojourne here, Our Bodyes may draw nere, And when our joyes they can noe more Extend, Then lett our soules beginn where they did end. 56. [A Song] [Wrong not, sweete Empress of my heart] Wrong not, sweete Empress of my heart, The merritt of true passion, Pretending that he feeles noe smart That sues for noe compassion, Since if my plaints come not to approve The conquest of thy beautie, It comes not from defect of love, But from excess of duty. For knowing that I sue to serve A sainte of such perfection, As all desire, but none deserve, A place in her affection, I rather chuse to want releife Then venter the revealing; Where glory recommends the greefe, Dispayre distrusts the healing. Thus those desires which ayme too high For any mortall lover, When reason cannot make them dye, Discretion doth them cover, Yet when discretion bids them leave The plaints which they should vtter, Then thy discretion may perceive That silence is a suiter. Silence in love bewrayes more woe Then words though never soe witty, A beggar that is dumbe, you knowe, May challenge double pitty. Then wrong not, deare heart of my heart, My true though secrete passion, Hee smarteth most that hides his smart And sues for noe compassion.</field>

[To his Forsaken Mistresse] I doe confess th'art smooth, and faire, &amp; I might ha' gon neer to loue thee had I not found y? sleightest pray'r y? lip could move had pow'r to move thee. but I can let y? now a lone, as worthy to be loued by none. I doe confess thart sweet, yet finde thee such an vnthrift of thy Sweetes, thy favors are but like the winde w?? kisseth eurythinge it meetes, and since thou canst w?? more then one th'art worthy to be kist by none. The morninge rose y? vntoucht standes, Armd w?? her briers how sweet she smels, but pluckt, &amp; straind through ruder Hands, her sweets noe longer w?? her dwels, but sent and beautye soone are gone And leaues fall from her one, by one. Such fate ere longe will thee betide, when thou hast Handled bin a whyle, w?? sear flowrs to be thrown asyde, And I shall syghe, when som will smile, to see thy loue to evry one hath brought thee to be loude by none. 58. A Song By Sir John Eaton. I Tell me not I my Time mis-spend, 'Tis Time lost to reprove me; Pursue thou thine, I have my End, So Chloris only love me; II Tell me not other Flocks are full, Mine poor, let them despise me Who more abound with Milk and Wool, So Chloris only prize me. III Tire other easier Ears with these Unappertaining Stories; He never felt the World's Disease, Who car'd not for its Glories. IV For Pity, thou that wiser art, Whose Thoughts lye wide of mine; Let me alone with my own Heart, And I'll ne'er envy thine. V Nor blame him who e'er blames my Wit, That seeks no higher Prize, Than in unenvy'd Shades to sit, And sing of Chloris' Eyes. 59. Old-Long-syne, First Part. Should old Acquaintance be forgot, And never thought upon, The Flames of Love extinguished, And freely past and gone? Is thy kind Heart now grown so cold In that Loving Breast of thine, That thou canst never once reflect On Old-long-syne? Where are thy Protestations, Thy Vows and Oaths, my Dear, Thou made to me, and I to thee, In Register yet clear? Is Faith and Truth so violate To the Immortal Gods Divine, That thou canst never once reflect On Old-long-syne? Is't Cupid's Fears, or frosty Cares, That makes thy Sp'rits decay? Or is't some Object of more Worth, That's stoll'n thy Heart away? Or some Desert, makes thee neglect Him, so much once was thine, That thou canst never once reflect On Old-long-syne? Is't Worldly Cares so desperate, That makes thee to despair? Is't that makes thee exasperate, And makes thee to forbear? If thou of that were free as I, Thou surely should be Mine: If this were true, we should renew Kind Old-long-syne. But since that nothing can prevail, And all Hope is in vain, From these rejected Eyes of mine Still Showers of Tears shall rain: And though thou hast me now forgot, Yet I'll continue Thine, And ne'er forget for to reflect On Old-long-syne. If e'er I have a House, my Dear, That truly is call'd mine, And can afford but Country Cheer, Or ought that's good therein; Tho' thou were Rebel to the King, And beat with Wind and Rain, Assure thy self of Welcome Love, For Old-long-syne. Second Part. My Soul is ravish'd with Delight When you I think upon; All Griefs and Sorrows take the Flight, And hastily are gone; The fair Resemblance of your Face So fills this Breast of mine, No Fate nor Force can it displace, For Old-long-syne. Since Thoughts of you doth banish Grief, When I'm from you removed; And if in them I find Relief, When with sad Cares I'm moved, How doth your Presence me affect With Ecstacies Divine, Especially when I reflect On Old-long-syne. Since thou has rob'd me of my Heart By those resistless Powers, Which Madam Nature doth impart To those fair Eyes of yours; With Honour it doth not consist To hold a Slave in Pyne, Pray let your Rigour then desist, For Old-long-syne. 'Tis not my Freedom I do crave By deprecating Pains; Sure Liberty he would not have Who glories in his Chains: But this I wish, the Gods would move That Noble Soul of thine To Pity, since thou cannot love For Old-long-syne. 60. [Scorn of Love's Power] What art thow Cupid or yo? queene of Loue that poetts fayne can our affections moue to like where yo? shall fancy, t'is not soe. Ile loue there only where I treuly know my loue shall bee repay'd w?? equall fire and both our harts make vp but one desire. Were my owne honor'd saint exactly Faire in euery parte soe exquisitly rare that the great Judge of Beautie would confesse shee'd farre exceede the three fam'd Goddessese made vp into one Beautie: I will scorne to bee hir Captiue, since I haue been forlorne.</field>
