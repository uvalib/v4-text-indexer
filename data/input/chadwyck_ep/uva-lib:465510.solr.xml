      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. ON THE PROSPECT OF PEACE, A POEM. To the LORD PRIVY-SEAL. By Mr. TICKEL. ? Sacerdos Fronde super Mitram, et fælici comptus olivâ. Virg. Contending kings, and fields of death, too long Have been the subject of the British song, Who hath not read of fam'd Ramilia's plain, Bavaria's fall, and Danube choak'd with slain? Exhausted themes! A gentle note I raise, And sing returning Peace in softer lays. Their fury quell'd, and martial rage allay'd, I wait our heroes in the sylvan shade: Disbanding hosts are imag'd to my mind, And warring pow'rs in friendly leagues combin'd; While ease and pleasure make the nations smile, And heav'n and Anna bless Britannia's isle. Well sends our Queen her mitred Bristol forth, For early counsels fam'd, and long-try'd worth, Who, thirty rolling years, had oft with-held The Suede and Saxon from the dusty field; Compleatly form'd, to heal the Christian wounds, To name the kings, and give each kingdom bounds; The face of ravag'd nature to repair, By leagues to soften earth, and heav'n by pray'r; To gain by love, where rage and slaughter fail, And make the crosier o'er the sword prevail. So when great Moses, with Jehovah's wand, Had scatter'd plagues o'er stubborn Pharaoh's land, Now spread an host of locusts round the shore, Now turn'd Nile's fatt'ning streams to putrid gore; Plenty and gladness mark'd the priest of God, And sudden almonds shot from Aaron's rod. O thou, from whom these bounteous blessings flow, To whom, as chief, the hopes of peace we owe, (For next to thee, the man whom kings contend To stile companion, and to make their friend, Great Strafford, rich in every courtly grace, With joyful pride accepts the second place) From Britain's isle, and Isis' sacred spring One hour, oh! listen while the muses sing. Tho' ministers of mighty monarchs wait, With beating hearts, to learn their masters' fate, One hour forbear to speak thy Queen's commands, Nor think the world, thy charge, neglected stands; The blissful prospects, in my verse display'd, May lure the stubborn, the deceiv'd persuade, Ev'n thou to peace shalt speedier urge the way, And more be hasten'd by this short delay. The haughty Gaul, in ten campaigns o'erthrown, Now ceas'd to think the western world his own. Oft had he mourn'd his boasting leaders bound, And his proud bulwarks smoaking on the ground; In vain with pow'rs renew'd he fill'd the plain, Made tim'rous vows, and brib'd the saints in vain; As oft his legions did the fight decline, Lurk'd in the trench, and skulk'd behind the line. Before his eyes the fancy'd jav'lin gleams; At feasts he starts, and seems dethron'd in dreams; On glory past reflects with secret pain, On mines exhausted, and on millions slain. To Britain's Queen the scepter'd suppliant bends, To her his crowns and infant race commends, Who grieves her fame with christian blood to buy, Nor asks for glory at a price so high. At her decree the war suspended stands, And Britain's heroes hold their lifted hands: Their open brows no threat'ning frowns disguise, But gentler passions sparkle in their eyes. The Gauls, who never in their courts could find Such temper'd fire with manly beauty join'd, Doubt if they're those, whom dreadful to the view In forms so fierce their fearful fancies drew, At whose dire names ten thousand widows press'd Their helpless orphans clinging to the breast. In silent rapture each his foe surveys, They vow firm friendship, and give mutual praise. Brave minds, howe'er at war, are secret friends, Their gen'rous discord with the battle ends; In peace they wonder whence dissention rose, And ask how souls so like could e'er be foes. Methinks I hear more friendly shouts rebound, And social clarions mix their sprightly sound; The British flags are furl'd, her troops disband, And scatter'd armies seek their native land. The hardy veteran, proud of many a scar, The manly charms and honours of the war, Who hop'd to share his friend's illustrious doom, And in the battle find a soldier's tomb, Leans on his spear to take his farewel view, And sighing bids the glorious camp adieu. Ye generous fair, receive the brave with smiles, O'erpay their sleepless nights, and crowns their toils; Soft beauty is the gallant soldier's due, For you they conquer, and they bleed for you. In vain proud Gaul with boastful Spain conspires, When English valour English beauty fires; The nations dread your eyes, and kings despair Of chiefs so brave, till they have nymphs so fair. See the fond wife, in tears of transport drown'd, Hugs her rough lord, and weeps o'er ev'ry wound; Hangs on the lips, that fields of blood relate, And smiles and trembles, at his various fate. Near the full bowl he draws the fancied line, And marks feign'd trenches in the flowing wine, Then sets th'invested fort before her eyes, And mines that whirl'd battalions to the skies; His little list'ning progeny turn pale, And beg again to hear the dreadful tale. Such dire atchievements sings the bard that tells Of palfrey'd dames, bold knights, and magic spells; Where whole brigades one champion's arms o'erthrow, And cleave a giant at a random blow; Slay panyms vile, that force the fair; and tame The goblin's fury, and the dragon's flame. Our eager youth to distant nations run, To visit fields their valiant fathers won; From Flandria's shore their country's fame they trace, Till far Germania shews her blasted face. Th'exulting Briton asks his mournful guide, Where his hard fate the lost Bavaria try'd; Where Stepney grav'd the stone to Anna's fame: He points to Blenheim, once a vulgar name; Here fled the Houshold, there did Tallard yield, Here Malb'rough turn'd the fortune of the field; On those steep banks, near Danube's raging flood, The Gauls thrice started back, and trembling stood; When, Churchill's arm perceiv'd, they stood not long, But plung'd amidst the waves, a desperate throng; Crowds whelm'd on crowds dash'd wide the watry bed, And drove the current to its distant head. As when by Raphael's, or by Kneller's hands A warlike courser on the canvas stands, Such as on Landen bleeding Ormond bore, Or set young Ammon on the Granic shore; If chance a gen'rous steed the work behold, He snorts, he neighs, he champs the foamy gold: So, Hocstet seen, tumultuous passions roll, And hints of glory fire the Briton's soul; In fancy'd fights he sees the troops engage, And all the tempest of the battle rage. Charm me, ye pow'rs, with scenes less nobly bright, Far humbler thoughts th'inglorious muse delight, Content to see the horrors of the field By plough-shares levell'd, or in flow'rs conceal'd. O'er shatter'd walls may creeping ivy twine, And grass luxuriant cloath the harmless mine, Tame flocks ascend the breach without a wound, Or crop the bastion, now a fruitful ground; While shepherds sleep, along the rampart laid, Or pipe beneath the formidable shade. Who was the man? (Oblivion blast his name, Torn out and blotted from the list of fame!) Who, fond of lawless rule, and proudly brave, First sunk the filial subject to a slave; His neighbour's realms by frauds un-kingly gain'd, In guiltless blood the sacred ermine stain'd; Laid schemes for death, to slaughter turn'd his heart, And fitted murder to the rules of art. Ah! curs'd ambition, to thy lures we owe All the great ills that mortals bear below. Curs'd by the hind, when to the spoil he yields His year's whole sweat and vainly-ripen'd fields; Curs'd by the maid, torn from her lover's side, When left a widow, though not yet a bride: By mothers curs'd, when floods of tears they shed, And scatter useless roses on the dead. Oh sacred Bristol! then what dangers prove The arts, thou smil'st on with paternal love? Then, mix'd with rubbish by the brutal foes, In vain the marble breathes, the canvas glows; To shades obscure the glitt'ring sword pursues The gentle poet and defenceless muse. A voice, like thine alone, might then asswage The warrior's fury, and controul his rage; To hear thee speak might the fierce Vandal stand, And fling the brandish'd sabre from his hand. Far hence be driv'n to Scythia's stormy shore The drum's harsh musick, and the cannon's roar; Let grim Bellona haunt the lawless plain, Where Tartar-clans and grisly Cossacks reign; Let the steel'd Turk be deaf to matrons' cries, See virgins ravish'd with relentless eyes; To death grey heads and smiling infants doom, Nor spare the promise of the pregnant womb; O'er wasted kingdoms spread his wide command, The savage lord of an unpeopled land. Her guiltless glory just Britannia draws From pure religion, and impartial laws: To Europe's wounds a mother's aid she brings, And holds in equal scales the rival kings: Her gen'rous sons in choicest gifts abound, Alike in arms, alike in arts renown'd. As when sweet Venus, (so the sable sings) Awak'd by Nereids from the Ocean springs; With smiles she sees the threat'ning billows rise, Spreads smooth the surge, and clears the louring skies; Light, o'er the deep, with flutt'ring Cupids crown'd, The pearly couch and silver turtles bound; Her tresses shed ambrosial odours round. Amidst the world of waves so stands serene Britannia's isle, the Ocean's stately queen; In vain the nations have conspir'd her fall, Her trench the sea, and fleets her floating wall; Defenceless barks, her powerful navy near, Have only waves and hurricanes to fear. What bold invader, or what land oppress'd Hath not her anger quell'd, her aid redress'd? Say, where have e'er her union-crosses sail'd, But much her arms, her justice more prevail'd? Her labours are to plead th'Almighty's cause, Her pride to teach th'untam'd barbarian laws: Who conquers, wins by brutal strength the prize; But 'tis a godlike work to civilize. Have we forgot how from great Russia's throne, The king, whose pow'r half Europe's regions own, Whose scepter waving, with one shout rush forth In swarms the harness'd millions of the north; Through realms of ice pursu'd his tedious way, To court our friendship, and our fame survey! Hence the rich prize of useful arts he bore, And round his empire spread the learned store, (T'adorn old realms is more than new to raise, His country's parent is a monarch's praise.) His bands now march in just array to war, And Caspian gulphs unusual navies bear; With Runic lays Smolensko's forests ring, And wond'ring Volga hears the muses sing. Did not the painted kings of India greet Our Queen, and lay their scepters at her feet? Chiefs who full bowls of hostile blood had quaff'd, Fam'd for the javelin, and invenom'd shaft; Whose haughty brows made savages adore, Nor bow'd to less than stars, or sun before: Her pitying smile accepts their suppliant claim, And adds four monarchs to the Christian name. Blest use of pow'r! O virtuous pride in kings! And like his bounty, whence dominion springs! Which o'er new worlds makes heaven's indulgence shine, And ranges myriads under laws divine! Well bought with all that those sweet regions hold, With groves of spices, and with mines of gold. Fearless our merchant now pursues his gain, And roams securely o'er the boundless main. Now o'er his head the polar bear he spies, And freezing spangles of the Lapland skies; Now swells his canvas to the sultry line, With glitt'ring spoils where Indian grottoes shine; Where fumes of incense glad the southern seas, And wafted citron scents the balmy breeze. Here nearer suns prepare the rip'ning gem, To grace great Anne's imperial diadem; And here the ore, whose melted mass shall yield On faithful coins each memorable field; Which mix'd with medals of immortal Rome, May clear disputes, and teach the time to come. In circling beams shall godlike Anna glow, And Churchill's sword hang o'er the prostrate foe; In comely wounds shall bleeding worthies stand, Webb's firm platoon, and Lumly's faithful band! Bold Mordaunt in Iberian trophies dress'd, And Campbell's dragon on his dauntless breast; Great Ormond's deeds on Vigo's spoils enroll'd, And Guiscard's knife on Harley's Chili gold. And if the muse, O Bristol, might decree, Here Granville noted by the lyre should be, The lyre for Granville, and the cross for thee. Such are the honours grateful Britain pays, So patriots merit, and so monarchs praise. O'er distant times such records shall prevail, When English numbers, antiquated, fail: A trifling song the muse can only yield, And sooth her soldiers panting from the field; To sweet retirements see them safe convey'd, And raise their battles in the rural shade. From fields of death to Woodstock's peaceful glooms (The poet's haunt) Britannia's hero comes— Begin, my muse, and softly touch the string: Here Henry lov'd; and Chaucer learn'd to sing. Hail fabled grotto! hail Elysian soil; Thou fairest spot of fair Britannia's isle! Where kings of old conceal'd forgot the throne, And beauty was content to shine unknown; Where love and war by turns pavilions rear, And Henry's bow'rs near Blenheim's dome appear; The weary'd champion lull in soft alcoves, The noblest boast of thy romantic groves. Oft, if the muse presage, shall he be seen By Rosamonda fleeting o'er the green, In dreams be hail'd by heroes' mighty shades; And hear old Chaucer warble through the glades: O'er the fam'd echoing vaults his name shall bound, And hill to hill reflect the favourite sound. Here, here at least thy love for arms give o'er, Nor, one world conquer'd, fondly wish for more. Vice of great souls alone! O thirst of fame! The muse admires it, while she strives to blame; Thy toils be now to chase the bounding deer, Or view the coursers stretch in wild career; This lovely scene shall sooth thy soul to rest, And wear each dreadful image from thy breast; With pleasure, by thy conquests shalt thou see Thy Queen triumphant, and all Europe free; No cares henceforth shall thy repose destroy, But what thou giv'st the world, thyself enjoy. Sweet solitude! when life's gay hours are past, Howe'er we range, in thee we fix at last; Toss'd through tempestuous seas (the voyage o'er) Pale we look back, and bless the friendly shore. Our own strict judges, our past life we scan, And ask if glory hath enlarg'd the span; If bright the prospect, we the grave defy, Trust future ages, and contented die. When strangers from far-distant climes shall come; To view the pomp of this triumphant dome; Where rear'd aloft dissembled trophies stand, And breathing labours of the sculptor's hand, Where Kneller's art shall paint the flying Gaul, And Bourbon's woes shall fill the story'd wall; Heirs of thy blood shall o'er their bounteous board Fix Europe's guard, thy monumental sword; Banners that oft have wav'd on conquer'd walls, And trumps, that drown'd the groans of gasping Gauls. Fair dames shall oft, with curious eye, explore The costly robes that slaughter'd gen'rals wore, Rich trappings from the Danube's whirlpools brought, (Hesperian nuns the gorgeous broid'ry wrought) Belts stiff with gold, the Boian horseman's pride, And Gaul's fair flow'rs, in human crimson dy'd. Of Churchill's race perhaps some lovely boy Shall mark the burnish'd steel that hangs on high; Shall gaze transported on its glitt'ring charms, And reach it struggling with unequal arms; By signs the drum's tumultuous sound request, Then seek, in starts, the hushing mother's breast. So, in the painter's animated frame, Where Mars embraces the soft Paphian dame, The little loves in sport the faulchion wield, Or join their strength to heave his pond'rous shield; One strokes the plume in Tityon's gore embru'd, And one the spear, that reeks in Typhon's blood; Another's infant brows the helm sustain, He nods his crest, and frights the shrieking train. Thus, the rude tempest of the field o'er-blown, Shall whiter rounds of smiling years roll on: Our victors, blest in peace, forget their wars, Enjoy past dangers, and absolve the stars. But oh! what sorrows shall bedew your urns, Ye honour'd shades, whom widow'd Albion mourns? If your thin forms yet discontented moan, And haunt the mangled mansions once your own; Behold what flow'rs the pious muses strow, And tears, which in the midst of triumph flow; Cypress and bays your envy'd brows surround, Your names the tender matron's heart shall wound, And the soft maid grow pensive at the sound. Accept, great Anne, the tears their mem'ry draws, Who nobly perish'd in their sov'reign's cause: For thou in pity bid'st the war give o'er, Mourn'st thy slain heroes, nor wilt venture more. Vast price of blood on each victorious day! (But Europe's freedom doth that price repay.) Lamented triumphs! when one breath must tell That Marlborough conquer'd, and that Dormer fell. Great Queen! whose name strikes haughty monarchs pale, On whose just scepter hangs Europa's scale; Whose arm like mercy wounds, decides like fate, On whose decree the nations anxious wait; From Albion's cliffs thy wide extended hand Shall o'er the main to far Peru command, So vast a tract whose wide domain shall run, Its circling skies shall see no setting sun. Thee, thee an hundred languages shall claim, And savage Indians swear by Anna's name; The line and poles shall own thy rightful sway, And thy commands the sever'd globe obey. Round the vast ball thy new dominions chain The wat'ry kingdoms, and controul the main; Magellan's streights to Gibraltar they join, Across the seas a formidable line; The sight of adverse Gaul we fear no more, But pleas'd see Dunkirk, now a guiltless shore. In vain great Neptune tore the narrow ground, And meant his waters for Britannia's bound; Her giant Genius takes a mighty stride, And sets his foot beyond th'incroaching tide; On either bank the land its master knows, And in the midst the subject ocean flows. So near proud Rhodes, across the raging flood, Stupendous form! the vast Colossus stood, (While at one foot their thronging gallies ride, A whole hour's sail scarce reach the farther side) Betwixt his brazen thighs, in loose array, Ten thousand streamers on the billows play. By Harley's counsels Dunkirk now restor'd To Britain's empire, owns her ancient lord. In him transfus'd his godlike father reigns, Rich in the blood which swell'd that patriot's veins, Who boldly faithful met his sov'reign's frown, And scorn'd for gold to yield th'important town. His son was born the ravish'd prey to claim, And France still trembles at an Harley's name. A sort so dreadful to our English shore, Our fleets scarce fear'd the sands or tempests more, Whose vast expences to such sums amount, That the tax'd Gaul scarce furnish'd out th'account: Whose walls such bulwarks, such vast tow'rs restrain, Its weakest ramparts are the rocks and main; His boast great Louis yields, and cheaply buys Thy friendship, Anna, with the mighty prize. Holland repining and in grief cast down, Sees the new glories of the British crown: Ah! may they ne'er provoke thee to the fight, Nor foes more dreadful than the Gauls invite, Soon may they hold the olive, soon asswage Their secret murmurs, nor call forth thy rage To rend their banks, and pour, at one command Thy realm the sea o'er their precarious land. Henceforth be thine, vice-gerent of the skies, Scorn'd worth to raise, and vice in robes chastise; To dry the orphan's tears, and from the bar Chase the brib'd judge, and hush the wordy war; Deny the curs'd blasphemer's tongue to rage, And turn God's fury from an impious age. Blest change! the soldier's late destroying hand Shall rear new temples in his native land; Mistaken zealots shall with fear behold, And beg admittance in our sacred fold; On her own works the pious Queen shall smile, And turn her cares upon her fav'rite isle. So the keen bolt a warrior angel aims, Array'd in clouds, and wrapt in mantling flames, He bears a tempest on his sounding wings, And his red arm the forky vengeance flings; At length, heav'n's wrath appeas'd, he quits the war, To roll his orb, and guide his destin'd star, To shed kind fate, and lucky hours bestow, And smile propitious on the world below. Around thy throne shall faithful nobles wait, These guard the church, and those direct the state, To Bristol, graceful in maternal tears, The church her tow'ry forehead gently rears, She begs her pious son t'assert her cause, Defend her rights, and reinforce her laws, With holy zeal the sacred work begin, To bend the stubborn and the meek to win. Our Oxford's earl in careful thought shall stand, To raise his Queen, and save a sinking land, The wealthiest glebe to rav'nous Spaniards known He marks, and makes the golden world our own: Content with hands unsoil'd to guard the prize, And keep the store with undesiring eyes. So round the tree, that bore Hesperian gold, The sacred watch lay curl'd in many a fold, His eyes up-rearing to th'untasted prey, The sleepless guardian wasted life away. Beneath the peaceful olives, rais'd by you, Her ancient pride shall ev'ry art renew; (The arts with you, fam'd Harcourt, shall defend, And courtly Bolingbroke, the Muse's friend) With piercing eye some search where nature plays, And trace the wanton through her darksome maze; Whence health from herbs; from seeds how groves begun, How vital streams in circling eddies run. Some teach, why round the sun the spheres advance, In the fix'd measures of their mystick dance: How tides, when heav'd by pressing moons, o'erflow, And sun-born Iris paints her flow'ry bow. In happy chains our daring language bound, Shall sport no more in arbitrary sound, But buskin'd bards henceforth shall wisely rage, And Grecian plans reform Britannia's stage: 'Till Congreve bids her smile, Augusta stands, And longs to weep when flowing Rowe commands: Britain's Spectators shall their strength combine To mend our morals, and our taste refine, Fight virtue's cause, stand up in wit's defence, Win us from vice, and laugh us into sense. Nor, Prior, hast thou hush'd the trump in vain, Thy lyre shall now revive her mirthful strain, New tales shall now be told; if right I see, The soul of Chaucer is restor'd in thee. Garth, in majestick numbers, to the stars Shall raise mock-heroes, and fantastick wars; Like the young spreading laurel, Pope, thy name Shoots up with strength, and rises into fame; With Phillips shall the peaceful vallies ring, And Britain hear a second Spenser sing; That much-lov'd youth, whom Utrecht's walls confine, To Bristol's praises shall his Strafford's join: He too, from whom attentive Oxford draws Rules for just thinking, and poetick laws, To growing bards his learned aid shall send, The strictest critick, and the kindest friend. Ev'n mine, a bashful Muse, whose rude essays Scarce hope for pardon, not aspire to praise, Cherish'd by you in time may grow to fame, And mine survive with Bristol's glorious name. Fir'd with the views this glitt'ring scene displays, And smit with passion for my country's praise, My artless reed attempts this lofty theme, Where sacred Isis rolls her ancient stream; In cloister'd domes, the great Philippa's pride, Where learning blooms, while fame and worth preside, Where the fifth Henry arts and arms was taught, And Edward form'd his Cressy, yet unfought; Where laurel'd bards have struck the warbling strings, The seat of sages, and the nurse of kings. Here thy commands, O Lancaster, inflame My eager breast to raise the British name; Urge on my soul, with no ignoble pride, To woo the Muse whom Addison enjoy'd; See that bold swan to heav'n sublimely soar, Pursue at distance, and his steps adore. To the Right Honourable the Earl of WARWICK, &amp;c. On the Death of Mr. ADDISON. By the Same. If, dumb too long, the drooping Muse hath stay'd, And left her debt to Addison unpaid; Blame not her silence, Warwick, but bemoan, And judge, oh judge, my bosom by your own, What mourner ever felt poetick fires! Slow comes the verse, that real woe inspires: Grief unaffected suits but ill with art, Or flowing numbers with a bleeding heart. Can I forget the dismal night, that gave My soul's best part for-ever to the grave! How silent did his old companions tread, By midnight lamps, the mansions of the dead, Thro' breathing statues, then unheeded things, Thro' rows of warriors, and thro' walks of kings! What awe did the slow solemn knell inspire; The pealing organ, and the pausing choir; The duties by the lawn-rob'd prelate pay'd; And the last words, that dust to dust convey'd! While speechless o'er thy closing grave we bend, Accept these tears, thou dear departed friend, Oh gone for ever, take this long adieu; And sleep in peace, next thy lov'd Montagu! To strew fresh laurels let the task be mine, A frequent pilgrim at thy sacred shrine; Mine with true sighs thy absence to bemoan, And grave with faithful epitaphs thy stone. If e'er from me thy lov'd memorial part, May shame afflict this alienated heart; Of thee forgetful if I form a song, My lyre be broken, and untun'd my tongue, My grief be doubled, from thy image free, And mirth a torment, unchastis'd by thee. Oft let me range the gloomy isles alone, (Sad luxury! to vulgar minds unknown) Along the walls where speaking marbles show What worthies form the hallow'd mould below: Proud names, who once the reins of empire held; In arms who triumph'd; or in arts excell'd; Chiefs, grac'd with scars, and prodigal of blood; Stern patriots, who for sacred freedom stood; Just men, by whom impartial laws are given; And saints, who taught, and led the way to heav'n. Ne'er to these chambers, where the mighty rest, Since their foundation, came a nobler guest; Nor e'er was to the bowers of bliss convey'd A fairer spirit, or more welcome shade. In what new region, to the just assign'd, What new employments please th'unbody'd mind? A winged virtue, through th'etherial sky, From world to world unweary'd does he fly, Or curious trace the long laborious maze Of heav'n's decrees, where wond'ring angels gaze? Does he delight to hear bold seraphs tell How Michael battled, and the dragon fell? Or, mix'd with milder cherubim, to glow In hymns of love, not ill essay'd below? Or dost thou warn poor mortals left behind, A task well suited to thy gentle mind? Oh, if sometimes thy spotless form descend, To me thy aid, thou guardian genius, lend! When age misguides me, or when fear alarms, When pain distresses, or when pleasure charms, In silent whisp'rings purer thoughts impart, And turn from ill a frail and feeble heart; Lead through the paths thy virtue trod before, 'Till bliss shall join, nor death can part us more. That aweful form (which, so the heav'ns decree, Must still be lov'd, and still deplor'd by me) In nightly visions seldom fails to rise, Or rous'd by fancy, meet my waking eyes. If business calls, or crowded courts invite, Th'unblemish'd statesman seems to strike my sight; If in the stage I seek to sooth my care, I meet his soul which breathes in Cato there; If pensive to the rural shades I rove, His shape o'ertakes me in the lonely grove: 'Twas there of just and good he reason'd strong, Clear'd some great truth, or rais'd some serious song; There patient show'd us the wise course to steer, A candid censor and a friend sincere; There taught us how to live; and (oh! too high The price for knowledge) taught us how to die. Thou hill, whose brow the antique structures grace, Rear'd by bold chiefs of Warwick's noble race, Why, once so lov'd, when-e'er thy bower appears, O'er my dim eye-balls glance the sudden tears! How sweet were once thy prospects fresh and fair, Thy sloping walks and unpolluted air! How sweet the glooms beneath thy aged trees, Thy noon-tide shadow, and the evening breeze! His image thy forsaken bowers restore; Thy walks and airy prospects charm no more; No more the summer in thy glooms allay'd, Thy evening breezes, and thy noon-day shade. From other ills, however fortune frown'd, Some refuge in the Muse's art I found; Reluctant now I touch the trembling string, Bereft of him, who taught me how to sing; And these sad accents, murmur'd o'er his urn, Betray that absence they attempt to mourn. Oh! must I then (now fresh my bosom bleeds, And Craggs in death to Addison succeeds) The verse, begun to one lost friend prolong, And weep a second in th'unfinish'd song! These words divine, which, on his death-bed laid, To thee, O Craggs, th'expiring sage convey'd, Great, but ill-omen'd monument of fame, Nor he surviv'd to give, nor thou to claim. Swift after him thy social spirit flies, And close to his, how soon! thy coffin lies. Blest pair! whose union future bards shall tell In future tongues: each other's boast! farewel. Farewel! whom join'd in fame, in friendship try'd, No chance could sever, nor the grave divide. COLIN AND LUCY. By the Same. I Of Leinster fam'd for maidens fair, Bright Lucy was the grace; Nor e'er did Liffy's limpid stream Reflect a fairer face; II 'Till luckless love and pining care Impair'd her rosy hue, Her dainty lip, her damask cheek, And eyes of glossy blue. III Ah! have you seen a lily pale When beating rains descend? So droop'd this slow-consuming maid, Her life now near its end. IV By Lucy warn'd, of flatt'ring swains Take heed, ye easy fair; Of vengeance due to broken vows, Ye flatt'ring swains beware! V Three times all in the dead of night, A bell was heard to ring; And at her window shrieking thrice, The raven flap'd his wing. VI Full well the love-lorn maiden knew The solemn boding sound, And thus in dying words bespake The virgins weeping round. VII “I hear a voice you cannot hear, “That cries, I must not stay; “I see a hand you cannot see, “That beckons me away. VIII “Of a false swain and broken heart, “In early youth I die; “Am I to blame, because the bride “Is twice as rich as I? IX “Ah, Colin, give not her thy vows, “Vows due to me alone! “Nor thou, rash girl, receive his kiss, “Nor think him all thy own! X “To-morrow in the church to wed “Impatient both prepare: “But know, false man, and know, fond maid, “Poor Lucy will be there. XI “Then bear my corse, ye comrades dear, “The bridegroom blithe to meet; “He in his wedding-trim so gay, “I in my winding sheet.” XII She spake, she dy'd, her corse was borne, The bridegroom blithe to meet; He in his wedding trim so gay, She in her winding sheet. XIII What then were Colin's dreadful thoughts; How were these nuptials kept? The bride-men flock'd round Lucy dead, And all the village wept. XIV Compassion, shame, remorse, despair, At once his bosom swell: The damps of death bedew'd his brow, He groan'd, he shook, he fell. XV From the vain bride, a bride no more, The varying crimson fled; When, stretch'd beside her rival's corse, She saw her lover dead. XVI He to his Lucy's new-made grave, Convey'd by trembling swains, In the same mould, beneath one sod, For-ever now remains. XVII Oft at this place the constant hind And plighted maid are seen; With garlands gay, and true-love knots They deck the sacred green. XVIII But, swain forsworn, who'er thou art, This hallow'd ground forbear! Remember Colin's dreadful fate, And fear to meet him there. AN IMITATION OF THE PROPHECY OF NEREUS. From Horace, Book III. Ode XXV. Dicam insigne, recens, adhuc Indictum ore alio. Non secus in jugis Exsomnis stupet Evias, Hebrum prospiciens, &amp; nive candidam Thracen, ac pede barbaro Lustratam Rhodopen. —Hor. As Mar his round one morning took, (Whom some call earl, and some call duke) And his new brethren of the blade, Shiv'ring with fear and frost, survey'd, On Perth's bleak hills he chanc'd to spy An aged wizard six foot high, With bristled hair and visage blighted, Wall-ey'd, bare-haunch'd, and second-sighted. The grizly sage in thought profound Beheld the chief with back so round, Then roll'd his eye-balls to and fro O'er his paternal hills of snow, And into these tremendous speeches Brake forth the prophet without breeches. Into what ills betray'd by thee, This ancient kingdom do I see! Her realms unpeopled and forlorn! Wae's me! that ever thou wert born! Proud English loons (our clans o'ercome) On Scottish pads shall amble home; I see them dress'd in bonnets blue, (The spoils of thy rebellious crew) I see the target cast away, And chequer'd plad become their prey, The chequer'd plad to make a gown For many a lass in London town. In vain the hungry mountaineers Come forth in all their warlike geers, The shield, the pistol, durk, and dagger, In which they daily wont to swagger; And oft have sally'd out to pillage The hen-roosts of some peaceful village, Or, while their neighbours were asleep, Have carry'd off a low-land sheep. What boots thy high-born host of beggars, Mac-leans, Mac-kenzies, and Mac-gregors, With popish cut-throats, perjur'd ruffians, And Forster's troops of raggamuffins? In vain thy lads around thee bandy, Inflam'd with bagpipe and with brandy. Doth not bold Sutherland the trusty, With heart so true, and voice so rusty, (A loyal soul) thy troops affright, While hoarsely he demands the fight? Do'st thou not gen'rous Ilay dread, The bravest hand, the wisest head? Undaunted do'st thou hear th'alarms Of hoary Athol sheath'd in arms? Douglas, who draws his lineage down From thanes and peers of high renown, Fiery and young, and uncontrol'd, With knights and squires, and barons bold, (His noble houshold-band) advances, And on his milk-white courser prances. Thee Forfar to the combat dares, Grown swarthy in Iberian wars: And Monroe kindled into rage Sowrly defies thee to engage; He'll rout thy foot, though ne'er so many, And horse to boot—if thou hadst any. But see Argyle with watchful eyes, Lodg'd in his deep intrenchments lies! Couch'd like a lion in thy way, He waits to spring upon his prey; While like a herd of tim'rous deer Thy army shakes and pants with fear, Led by their doughty gen'ral's skill, From frith to frith, from hill to hill. Is thus thy haughty promise pay'd That to the Chevalier was made, When thou didst oaths and duty barter For dukedom, gen'ralship, and garter? Three moons thy Jemmy shall command, With highland sceptre in his hand, Too good for his pretended birth —Then down shall fall the king of Perth. 'Tis so decreed: for George shall reign, And traitors be forsworn in vain. Heav'n shall for ever on him smile, And bless him still with an Argyle. While thou, pursu'd by vengeful foes, Condemn'd to barren rocks and snows, And hinder'd passing Inverlocky, Shalt burn thy clan, and curse poor Jocky. TO Sir GODFREY KNELLER, at his Country Seat. By the Same. To Whitton's shades, and Hounslow's airy plain, Thou, Kneller, tak'st thy summer flights in vain, In vain thy wish gives all thy rural hours To the fair villa, and well-order'd bowers; To court thy pencil early at thy gates, Ambition knocks, and fleeting Beauty waits; The boastful Muse, of others fame so sure, Implores thy aid to make her own secure; The great, the fair, and (if ought nobler be, Ought more belov'd) the Arts solicit thee. How can'st thou hope to fly the world, in vain From Europe sever'd by the circling main: Sought by the kings of every distant land, And every heroe worthy of thy hand. Hast thou forgot that mighty Bourbon fear'd He still was mortal, till thy draught appear'd; That Cosmo chose thy glowing form to place Amidst her masters of the Lombard race? See on her Titian's and her Guido's urns, Her failing arts, forlorn Hesperia mourns; While Britain wins each garland from her brow, Her wit and freedom first, her painting now. Let the faint copier, on old Tyber's shore, (Nor mean the task) each breathing bust explore, Line after line with painful patience trace, This Roman grandeur, that Athenian grace; Vain care of parts; if, impotent of soul, Th'industrious workman fails to warm the whole Each theft betrays the marble whence it came, And a cold statue stiffen in the frame. Thee Nature taught, nor Art her aid deny'd, (The kindest mistress and the surest guide) To catch a likeness at one piercing sight, And place the fairest in the fairest light. Ere yet the pencil tries her nicer toils, Or on the palette lie the blended oyls, Thy careless chalk has half atchiev'd thy art, And her just image makes Cleora start. A mind that grasps the whole is rarely found, Half learn'd, half painters, and half wits abound: Few, like thy genius, at proportion aim, All great, all graceful, and throughout the same. Such be thy life. O since the glorious rage That fir'd thy youth, flames unsubdu'd by age; Tho' wealth nor fame now touch thy sated mind, Still tinge the canvas, bounteous to mankind. Since after thee may rise an impious line, Coarse manglers of the human face divine, Paint on, till fate dissolve thy mortal part, And live and die the monarch of thy art. ON THE Death of the Earl of CADOGAN. By the Same. Of Marlb'rough's captains and Eugenio's friends, The last, Cadogan to the grave descends: Low lies each head, whence Blenheim's glory sprung, The chiefs who conquer'd, and the bards who sung. From his cold corse tho' every friend be fled, Lo! Envy waits, that lover of the dead. Thus did she feign o'er Nassau's herse to mourn; Thus wept insidious, Churchill, o'er thy urn; To blast the living, give the dead their due, And wreaths, herself had tainted, trim'd anew. Thou yet unnam'd to fill his empty place, And lead to war thy country's growing race, Take every wish a British heart can frame, Add palm to palm, and rise from fame to fame. An hour must come, when thou shalt hear with rage Thyself traduc'd, and curse a thankless age: Nor yet for this decline the gen'rous strife, These ill, brave man, shall quit thee with thy life; Alive though stain'd by every abject slave, Secure of fame, and justice in the grave. Ah! no—when once the mortal yields to fate, The blast of Fame's sweet trumpet sounds too late, Too late to stay the spirit on its flight, Or sooth the new inhabitant of light; Who hears regardless, while fond man, distress'd, Hangs on the absent, and laments the blest. Farewel then fame, ill sought thro' fields of blood, Farewel unfaithful promiser of good: Thou musick, warbling to the deafen'd ear! Thou incense wasted on the fun'ral bier! Through life pursu'd in vain, by death obtain'd, When ask'd, deny'd us, and when giv'n, disdain'd. AN ODE Inscrib'd to the Right Honourable the EARL OF SUNDERLAND AT WINDSOR. By the Same. I Thou dome, where Edward first enroll'd His red-cross knights and barons bold, Whose vacant seats, by virtue bought, Ambitious emperors have sought; Where Britain's foremost names are found, In peace belov'd, in war renown'd, Who made the hostile nations moan, Or brought a blessing on their own: II Once more a son of Spencer waits, A name familiar to thy gates, Sprung from the chief whose prowess gain'd The garter, while thy founder reign'd. He offer'd here his dinted shield, The dread of Gauls in Cressi's field, Which in thy high-arch'd temple rais'd, For four long centuries hath blaz'd. III These seats our sires, a hardy kind, To the fierce sons of war consign'd, The flow'ry of chivalry, who drew With sinewy arm the stubborn yew; Or with heav'd poll-axe clear'd the field, Or who in jousts and tourneys skill'd, Before their ladies' eyes renown'd, Threw horse and horseman to the ground. IV In after-times, as courts refin'd, Our patriots in the list were join'd, Nor only Warwick stain'd with blood, Or Marlb'rough near the Danube's flood, Have in their crimson crosses glow'd; But, on just law-givers bestow'd, These emblems Cecil did invest, And gleam'd on wise Godolphin's breast. V So Greece, ere arts began to rise, Fix'd huge Orion in the skies, And stern Alcides, fam'd in wars, Bespangled with a thousand stars; 'Till letter'd Athens round the pole Made gentler constellations roll, In the blue heavens the Names of Constellations. Lyre she strung, And near the Maid the Balance hung. VI Then, Spencer, mount amid the band, Where knights and kings promiscuous stand. What though the hero's flame repress'd Burns calmly in thy generous breast; Yet who more dauntless to oppose In doubtful days our home-bred foes? Who rais'd his country's wealth so high, Or view'd with less desiring eye? VII The sage who large of soul surveys The globe, and all its empires weighs, Watchful the various climes to guide, Which seas, and tongues, and faiths divide, A nobler name in Windsor's shrine Shall leave, if right the Muse divine, Than sprung of old, abhorr'd and vain, From ravag'd realms and myriads slain. VIII Why praise we, prodigal of fame, The rage that sets the world on flame? My guiltless Muse his brow shall bind Whose godlike bounty spares mankind: For those, whom bloody garlands crown, The brass may breathe, the marble frown; To him, through every rescu'd land, Ten thousand living trophies stand. KENSINGTON GARDEN. By the Same. Campos, ubi Troja fuit. Virg. Where Kensington high o'er the neighb'ring lands, 'Midst greens and sweets, a regal fabrick stands, And sees each spring, luxuriant in her bowers, A snow of blossoms, and a wild of flowers, The dames of Britain oft in crowds repair To groves and lawns, and unpolluted air. Here, while the town in damps and darkness lies, They breathe in sun-shine, and see azure skies Each walk, with robes of various dies bespread, Seems from afar a moving tulip-bed, Where rich brocades and glossy damasks glow, And chints, the rival of the show'ry bow. Here England's Daughter, darling of the land, Sometimes, surrounded with her virgin band, Gleams through the shades. She, tow'ring o'er the rest, Stands fairest of the fairer kind confess'd, Form'd to gain hearts, that Brunswick's cause deny'd, And charm a people to her father's side. Long have these groves to royal guests been known, Nor Nassau first prefer'd them to a throne. Ere Norman banners wav'd in British air; Ere lordly Hubba with the golden hair Pour'd in his Danes; ere elder Julius came; Or Dardan Brutus gave our isle a name; A prince of Albion's lineage grac'd the wood, The scene of wars, and stain'd with lovers' blood. You, who through gazing crowds, your captive throng, Throw pangs and passions, as you move along, Turn on the left, ye fair, your radiant eyes, Where all un-levell'd the gay garden lies: If generous anguish for another's pains Ere heav'd your hearts, or shiver'd through your veins, Look down attentive on the pleasing dale, And listen to my melancholy tale. That hollow space, where now in living rows, Line above line the yew's sad verdure grows, Was, ere the planter's hand its beauty gave, A common pit, a rude unfashion'd cave; The landskip now so sweet we well may praise, But far, far sweeter in its ancient days, Far sweeter was it, when its peopled ground With fairy domes and dazzling tow'rs were crown'd. Where in the midst those verdant pillars spring, Rose the proud palace of the Elfin king; For every hedge of vegetable green, In happier years a crowded street was seen, Nor all those leaves, that now the prospect grace, Could match the numbers of its pigmy race. What urg'd this mighty empire to its fate, A tale of woe and wonder I relate. When Albion rul'd the land, whose lineage came From Neptune mingling with a mortal dame, Their midnight pranks the sprightly fairies play'd On ev'ry hill, and danc'd in every shade. But, foes to sun-shine, most they took delight In dells and dales conceal'd from human sight: There hew'd their houses in the arching rock; Or scoop'd the bosom of the blasted oak; Or heard, o'ershadow'd by some shelving hill, The distant murmurs of the falling rill. They, rich in pilfer'd spoils, indulg'd their mirth, And pity'd the huge wretched sons of earth. Even now, 'tis said, the hinds o'erheard their strain, And strive to view their airy forms in vain; They to their cells at man's approach repair, Like the shy leveret, or the mother hare, The whilst poor mortals startle at the sound Of unseen footsteps on the haunted ground. Amid this garden, then with woods o'ergrown, Stood the lov'd seat of royal Oberon. From every region to his palace gate Came peers and princes of the fairy state, Who, rank'd in council round the sacred shade, Their monarch's will and great behests obey'd. From Thame's fair banks, by lofty tow'rs adorn'd, With loads of plunder oft his chiefs return'd: Hence in proud robes, and colours bright and gay, Shone every knight and every lovely fay. Whoe'er on Powell's dazzling stage display'd Hath fam'd king Pepin and his court survey'd, May guess, if old by modern things we trace, The pomp and splendor of the fairy race. By magic fenc'd, by spell encompass'd round, No mortal touch'd this interdicted ground; No mortal enter'd, those alone who came Stolen from the couch of some terrestrial dame: For oft of babes they robb'd the matron's bed, And left some sickly changeling in their stead. It chanc'd a youth of Albion's royal blood Was foster'd here, the wonder of the wood; Milkah, for wiles above her peers renown'd, Deep-skill'd in charms and many a mystic sound, As through the regal dome she sought for prey, Observ'd the infant Albion where he lay In mantles broider'd o'er with gorgeous pride, And stole him from the sleeping mother's side. Who now but Milkah triumphs in her mind! Ah wretched nymph, to future evils blind! The time shall come when thou shalt dearly pay The theft, hard-hearted! of that guilty day: Thou in thy turn shalt like the queen repine, And all her sorrows doubled shall be thine: He who adorns thy house, the lovely boy Who now adorns it, shall at length destroy. Two hundred moons in their pale course had seen The gay-rob'd sairies glimmer on the green, And Albion now had reach'd in youthful prime To nineteen years, as mortals measure time. Flush'd with resistless charms he fir'd to love Each nymph and little Dryad of the grove; For skilful Milkah spar'd not to employ Her utmost art to rear the princely boy. Each supple limb she swaith'd, and tender bone, And to the Elfin standard kept him down; She robb'd dwarf-elders of their fragrant fruit, And fed him early with the daisy's root, Whence through his veins the powerful juices ran, And form'd in beauteous miniature the Man. Yet still, two inches taller than the rest, His lofty port his human birth confess'd; A foot in height, how stately did he show! How look superior on the crowd below! What knight like him could toss the rushy launce! Who move so graceful in the mazy dance! A shape so nice, or features half so fair, What elf could boast! or such a flow of hair! Bright Kenna saw, a princess born to reign, And felt the charmer burn in every vein. She, heiress to this empire's potent lord, Prais'd like the stars, aud next the moon ador'd. She, whom at distance thrones and princedoms view'd, To whom proud Oriel and Azuriel su'd, In her high palace languish'd, void of joy, And pin'd in secret for a mortal boy. He too was smitten, and discreetly strove By courtly deeds to gain the virgin's love; For her he cull'd the fairest flowers that grew, Ere morning suns had drain'd their fragrant dew; He chas'd the hornet in his mid-day flight, And brought her glow-worms in the noon of night; When on ripe fruit she cast a wishing eye, Did ever Albion think the tree too high! He show'd her where the pregnant goldfinch hung, And the wren-mother brooding o'er her young; To her th'inscription on their eggs he read, (Admire, ye clerks, the youth whom Milkah bred) To her he show'd each herb of virtuous juice, Their powers distinguish'd, and describ'd their use: All vain their powers alas to Kenna prove, And well sung Ovid, There's no herb for love. As when a ghost, enlarg'd from realms below, Seeks its old friend to tell some secret woe, The poor shade shivering stands, and must not break His painful silence, till the mortal speak; So far'd it with the little love-sick maid, Forbid to utter what her eyes betray'd. He saw her anguish, and reveal'd his flame, And spar'd the blushes of the tongue-ty'd dame. The day would fail me, should I reckon o'er The sighs they lavish'd, and the oaths they swore; In words so melting, that, compar'd with those, The nicest courtship of terrestrial beaus Wou'd sound like compliments from country-clowns To red-cheek'd sweet-hearts in their home-spun gowns. All in a lawn of many a various hue, A bed of flowers (a fairy forest) grew; 'Twas here one noon, the gaudiest of the May, The still, the secret, silent hour of day, Beneath a lofty tulip's ample shade Sate the young lover and th'immortal maid. They thought all fairies slept, ah luckless pair! Hid, but in vain, in the sun's noon-tide glare! When Albion leaning on his Kenna's breast, Thus all the softness of his soul express'd. ‘All things are hush'd. The sun's meridian rays ‘Veil the horizon in one mighty blaze; ‘Nor moon nor star in heav'n's blue arch is seen ‘With kindly rays to silver o'er the green. ‘Grateful to fairy eyes; they secret take ‘Their rest, and only wretched mortals wake. ‘This dead of day I fly to thee alone, ‘A world to me, a multitude in one. ‘Oh sweet as dew-drops on these flowery lawns, ‘When the sky opens and the evening dawns! ‘Streight as the pink, that tours so high in air ‘Soft as the blue-bell! as the daisy, fair ‘Blest be the hour, when first I was convey'd ‘An infant captive to this blissful shade! ‘And blest the hand that did my form refine, ‘And shrunk my stature to a match with thine! ‘Glad I for thee renounce my royal birth, ‘And all the giant-daughters of the earth. ‘Thou, if thy breast with equal ardour burn, ‘Renounce thy kind, and love for love return. ‘So from us two, combin'd by nuptial ties, ‘A race unknown of demi-gods shall rise. ‘Oh speak, my love! my vows with vows repay, ‘And sweetly swear my rising fears away.’ To whom (the shining azure of her eyes More brighten'd) thus th'enamour'd maid replies. ‘By all the stars, and first the glorious moon, ‘I swear, and by the head of Oberon, ‘A dreadful oath! no prince of fairy line ‘Shall e'er in wedlock plight his vows with mine. ‘Where-e'er my footsteps in the dance are seen, ‘May toadstools rise, and mildews blast the green, ‘May the keen east-wind blight my fav'rite flowers, ‘And snakes and spotted adders haunt my bowers. ‘Confin'd whole ages in an hemlock shade, ‘There rather pine I a neglected maid; ‘Or worse, exil'd from Cynthia's gentle rays, ‘Parch in the sun a thousand summer-days, ‘Than any prince, a prince of fairy line, ‘In sacred wedlock plight his vows with mine.’ She ended: and with lips of rosy hue Dipt five times over in ambrosial dew, Stifled his words. When from his covert rear'd, The frowning brow of Oberon appear'd. A sun-flower's trunk was near, whence (killing sight!) The monarch issu'd, half an ell in height: Full on the pair a furious look he cast, Nor spake, but gave his bugle-horn a blast, That through the woodland echo'd far and wide, And drew a swarm of subjects to his side. A hundred chosen knights, in war renown'd, Drive Albion banish'd from the sacred ground; And twice ten myriads guard the bright abodes, Where the proud king, among his demi-gods, For Kenna's sudden bridal bids prepare, And to Azuriel gives the weeping fair. If fame in arms, with ancient birth combin'd, And faultless beauty, and a spotless mind, To love and praise can generous souls incline, That love, Azuriel, and that praise were thine. Blood, only less than royal, fill'd thy veins, Proud was thy roof, and large thy fair domains, Where now the skies high Holland-house invades, And short-liv'd Warwick sadden'd all the shades, Thy dwelling stood; nor did in him afford A nobler owner, or a lovelier lord. For thee a hundred fields produc'd their store, And by thy name ten thousand vassals swore; So lov'd thy name, that, at their monarch's choice, All Fairy shouted with a gen'ral voice. Oriel alone a secret rage suppress'd, That from his bosom heav'd the golden vest. Along the banks of Thame his empire ran, Wide was his range, and populous his clan. When cleanly servants, if we trust old tales, Besides their wages had good fairy vails, Whole heaps of silver tokens, nightly paid The careful wife or the neat dairy-maid, Sunk not his stores. With smiles and powerful bribes He gain'd the leaders of his neighbour tribes, And ere the night the face of heav'n had chang'd, Beneath his banners half the fairies rang'd. Mean-while driven back to earth, a lonely way The chearless Albion wander'd half the day, A long, long journey, choak'd with brakes and thorns, Ill-measur'd by ten thousand barley-corns. Tir'd out at length, a spreading stream he spy'd Fed by old Thame, a daughter of the tide: 'Twas then a spreading stream, though now its fame Obscur'd, it bears the creek's inglorious name, And creeps, as through contracted bounds it strays, A leap for boys in these degenerate days. On the clear crystal's verdant bank he stood, And thrice look'd backward on the fatal wood, And thrice he groan'd, and thrice he beat his breast, And thus in tears his kindred gods address'd. ‘If true, ye watery powers, my lineage came ‘From Neptune mingling with a mortal dame; ‘Down to his court, with coral garlands crown'd, ‘Through all your grottoes waft my plaintive sound, ‘And urge the god, whose trident shakes the earth, ‘To grace his off-spring, and assert my birth.’ He said. A gentle Naiad heard his prayer, And, touch'd with pity for a lover's care, Shoots to the sea, where low beneath the tides Old Neptune in th'unfathom'd depth resides. Rous'd at the news the sea's stern sultan swore Revenge, and scarce from present arms forbore; But first the nymph his harbinger he sends, And to her care his fav'rite boy commends. As through the Thames her backward course she guides, Driven up his current by the refluent tides, Along his banks the pygmy legions spread She spies, and haughty Oriel at their head. Soon with wrong'd Albion's name the host she fires, And counts the ocean's god among his sires; ‘The ocean's god, by whom shall be o'erthrown ‘(Styx hear'd his oath) the tyrant Oberon. ‘See here beneath a toadstool's deadly gloom ‘Lies Albion: Him the Fates your leader doom. ‘Hear and obey; 'tis Neptune's powerful call, ‘By him Azuriel and his king shall fall.’ She said. They bow'd: and on their shield up-bore With shouts their new-saluted emperor. Even Oriel smil'd: at least to smile he strove, And hopes of vengeance triumph'd over love. See now the mourner of the lonely shade By gods protected, and by hosts obey'd, A slave, a chief, by fickle Fortune's play, In the short course of one revolving day. What wonder if the youth, so strangely blest, Felt his heart flutter in his little breast! His thick-embattel'd troops, with secret pride, He views extended half an acre wide; More light he treads, more tall he seems to rise, And struts a straw-breadth nearer to the skies. O for thy Muse, Mr. Addison. great Bard, whose lofty strains In battle join'd the Pygmies and the Cranes! Each gaudy knight, had I that warmth divine, Each colour'd legion in my verse should shine. But simple I, and innocent of art, The tale, that sooth'd my infant years, impart, The tale I heard whole winter eves, untir'd, And sing the battles, that my nurse inspir'd. Now the shrill corn-pipes, echoing loud to arms, To rank and file reduce the straggling swarms. Thick rows of spears at once, with sudden glare, A grove of needles, glitter in the air; Loose in the wind small ribbon streamers flow, Dipt in all colours of the heav'nly bow, And the gay host, that now its march pursues, Gleams o'er the meadows in a thousand hues. On Buda's plains thus formidably bright, Shone Asia's sons, a pleasing dreadful sight. In various robes their silken troops were seen, The blue, the red, and prophet's sacred green: When blooming Brunswick near the Danube's flood, First stained his maiden sword in Turkish blood. Unseen and silent march the slow brigades Through pathless wilds, and unfrequented shades. In hopes already vanquish'd by surprize, In Albion's power the fairy empire lies; Already has he seiz'd on Kenna's charms, And the glad beauty trembles in his arms. The march concludes; and now in prospect near, But fenc'd with arms, the hostile towers appear, For Oberon, or Druids falsely sing, Wore his prime visir in a magick ring. A subtle spright, that opening plots foretold By sudden dimness on the beamy gold. Hence in a crescent form'd, his legions bright With beating bosoms waited for the fight; To charge their foes they march, a glitt'ring band, And in their van doth bold Azuriel stand. What rage that hour did Albion's soul possess, Let chiefs imagine, and let lovers guess! Forth issuing from his ranks, that strove in vain To check his course, athwart the dreadful plain He strides indignant: and with haughty cries To single fight the fairy prince defies. Forbear, rash youth, th'unequal war to try; Nor, sprung from mortals, with immortals vie. No god stands ready to avert thy doom, Nor yet thy grandsire of the waves is come. My words are vain—no words the wretch can move, By beauty dazled, and betwich'd by love: He longs, he burns to win the glorious prize, And sees no danger, while he sees her eyes. Now from each host the eager warriors start, And furious Albion flings his hasty dart: 'Twas feather'd from the bee's transparent wing, And its shaft ended in a hornet's sting; But, toss'd in rage, it flew without a wound, High o'er the foe, and guiltless pierc'd the ground, Not so Azuriel's: with un-erring aim Too near the needle-pointed jav'lin came, Drove through the seven-fold shield, and silken vest, And lightly ras'd the lover's ivory breast. Rous'd at the smart, and rising to the blow, With his keen sword he cleaves his fairy foe, Sheer from the shoulder to the waist he cleaves, And of one arm the tott'ring trunk bereaves. His useless steel brave Albion wields no more, But sternly smiles, and thinks the combat o'er: So had it been, had aught of mortal strain, Or less than fairy felt the deadly pain. But empyreal forms, howe'er in fight Gash'd and dismember'd, easily unite. As some frail cup of China's purest mold, With azure varnish'd, and bedrop'd with gold, Tho' broke, if cur'd by some nice virgin's hands, In its old strength and pristine beauty stands; The tumults of the boiling Bohea braves, And hold secure the Coffee's sable waves: So did Azuriel's arm, if fame say true, Rejoin the vital trunk whence first it grew; And, whilst in wonder fix'd poor Albion stood, Plung'd the curs'd sabre in his heart's warm blood. The golden broidery tender Milkah wove, The breast to Kenna sacred and to love, Lie rent and mangled: and the gaping wound Pours out a flood of purple on the ground. The jetty lustre sickens in his eyes: On his cold cheeks the bloomy freshness dies; ‘Oh Kenna, Kenna, thrice he try'd to say, ‘Kenna farewel:’ and sigh'd his soul away. His fall the Dryads with loud shrieks deplore, By sister Naiads echo'd from the shore, Thence down to Neptune's secret realms convey'd, Through grots, and glooms, and many a coral shade. The sea's great sire, with looks denouncing war, The trident shakes, and mounts the pearly carr: With one stern frown the wide-spread deep deforms, And works the madding ocean into storms. O'er foaming mountains, and through bursting tides, Now high, now low, the bounding chariot rides, 'Till through the Thames in a loud whirlwind's roar It shoots, and lands him on the destin'd shore. Now fix'd on earth his tow'ring stature stood, Hung o'er the mountains, and o'erlook'd the wood. To Brumpton's grove one ample stride he took, (The valleys trembled, and the forests shook) The next huge step reach'd the devoted shade, Where choak'd in blood was wretched Albion laid: Where now the vanquish'd, with the victors join'd, Beneath the regal banners stood combin'd. Th'embattel'd dwarfs with rage and scorn he past, And on their town his eye vindictive cast. Its deep foundations his strong trident cleaves, And high in air th'up-rooted empire heaves; On his broad engine the vast ruin hung, Which on the foe with force divine he flung; Aghast the legions in th'approaching shade, Th'inverted spires and rocking domes survey'd, That downward tumbling on the host below Crush'd the whole nation at one dreadful blow. Towers, arms, nymphs, warriors, are together lost, And a whole empire falls to sooth sad Albion's ghost. Such was the period, long restrain'd by Fate, And such the downfal of the fairy state. This dale, a pleasing region, not unblest, This dale possess'd they; and had still possess'd, Had not their monarch, with a father's pride, Rent from her lord th'inviolable bride, Rash to dissolve the contract seal'd above, The solemn vows and sacred bonds of love. Now, where his elves so brightly danc'd the round, No violet breathes, nor daisy paints the ground, His towers and people fill one common grave, A shapeless ruin, and a barren cave. Beneath huge hills of smoaking piles he lay Stun'd and confounded a whole summer's day. At length awak'd (for what can long restrain Unbody'd spirits!) but awak'd in pain: And as he saw the desolated wood, And the dark den where once his empire stood, Grief chill'd his heart: to his half-open'd eyes In every oak a Neptune seem'd to rise: He fled: and left, with all his trembling peers, The long possession of a thousand years. Thro' bush, thro' brake, thro' groves and gloomy dales, Thro' dank and dry, o'er streams and flowery vales, Direct they fled; but often look'd behind, And stop'd and started at each russling wind. Wing'd with like fear, his abdicated bands Disperse and wander into different lands; Part did beneath the Peak's deep caverns lie, In silent glooms impervious to the sky; Part on fair Avon's margin seek repose, Whose stream o'er Britain's midmost region flows, Where formidable Neptune never came, And seas and oceans are but known by fame: Some to dark woods and secret shades retreat, And some on mountains chuse their airy seat. There haply by the ruddy damsel seen, Or shepherd-boy, they featly foot the green, While from their steps a circling verdure springs; But fly from towns, and dread the courts of kings. Mean-while sad Kenna, loth to quit the grove, Hung o'er the body of her breathless love, Try'd every art (vain arts!) to change his doom, And vow'd (vain vows!) to join him in the tomb. What could she do; the Fates alike deny The dead to live, or fairy forms to die. An herb there grows (the same old Odyss. l. 10. Homer tells Ulysses bore to rival Circe's spells) Its root is ebon-black, but sends to light A stem that bends with flow'rets milky white, Moly the plant, which gods and fairies know, But secret kept from mortal men below. On his pale limbs its virtuous juice she shed, And murmur'd mystick numbers o'er the dead, When lo! the little shape by magick power Grew less and less, contracted to a flower; A flower, that first in this sweet garden smil'd, To virgins sacred, and the Snow-drop styl'd. The new-born plant with sweet regret she view'd, Warm'd with her sighs, and with her tears bedew'd, Its ripen'd seeds from bank to bank convey'd, And with her lover whiten'd half the shade. Thus won from death each spring she sees him grow, And glories in the vegetable snow, Which now increas'd through wide Britannia's plains, Its parent's warmth and spotless name retains; First leader of the flowery race aspires, And foremost catches the sun's genial fires, 'Midst frosts and snows triumphant dares appear, Mingles the seasons, and leads on the year. Deserted now of all the pygmy race, Nor man nor fairy touch'd this guilty place. In heaps on heaps, for many a rolling age, It lay accurs'd, the mark of Neptune's rage; 'Till great Nassau recloath'd the desart shade, Thence sacred to Britannia's monarchs made. 'Twas then the green-rob'd nymph, fair Kenna, came, (Kenna that gave the neighb'ring town its name) Proud when she saw th'ennobled garden shine With nymphs and heroes of her lover's line. She vow'd to grace the mansions once her own, And picture out in plants the fairy town. To far-fam'd Wise her flight unseen she sped, And with gay prospects fill'd the craftsman's head, Soft in his fancy drew a pleasing scheme, And plan'd that landskip in a morning dream. With the sweet view the fire of gardens fir'd, Attempts the labour by the nymph inspir'd, The walls and streets in rows of yew designs, And forms the town in all its ancient lines; The corner trees he lifts more high in air, And girds the palace with a verdant square; Nor knows, while round he views the rising scenes, He builds a city as he plants his greens. With a sad pleasure the aërial maid This image of her ancient realm survey'd; How chang'd, how fallen from its primæval pride! Yet here each moon, the hour her lover dy'd, Each moon his solemn obsequies she pays, And leads the dance beneath pale Cynthia's rays; Pleas'd in the shades to head her fairy train, And grace the groves where Albion's kinsmen reign. AN EPISTLE from a Lady in England, TO A GENTLEMAN at Avignon. By the Same. To thee, dear rover, and thy vanquish'd friends, The health she wants, thy gentle Chloe sends; Though much you suffer, think I suffer more, Worse than an exile on my native shore. Companions in your master's flight you roam, Unenvy'd by your haughty foes at home; For-ever near the royal out-law's side, You share his fortunes, and his hopes divide; On glorious schemes, and thoughts of empire dwell, And with imaginary titles swell. Say, (for thou know'st I own his sacred line, The passive doctrine, and the right divine) Say, what new succours does the chief prepare? The strength of armies? or the force of pray'r? Does he from heav'n or earth his hopes derive? From saints departed? or from priests alive? Nor saints nor priests can Brunswick's troops withstand, And beads drop useless through the zealot's hand; Heav'n to our vows may future kingdoms owe, But skill and courage win the crowns below. Ere to thy cause, and thee, my heart inclin'd, Or love to party had seduc'd my mind, In female joys I took a dull delight, Slept all the morn, and punted half the night; But now, with fears and publick cares possess'd, The church, the church, for-ever breaks my rest. The Post-boy on my pillow I explore, And sift the news of ev'ry foreign shore, Studious to find new friends, and new allies; What armies march from Sweden in disguise; How Spain prepares her banners to unfold, And Rome deals out her blessings, and her gold: Then o'er the map my finger taught to stray, Cross many a region marks the winding way; From sea to sea, from realm to realm I rove, And grow a mere geographer by love. But still Avignon, and the pleasing coast That holds Thee banish'd, claims my care the most; Oft on the well-known spot I fix my eyes, And span the distance that between us lies. Let not our James, tho' foil'd in arms, despair, Whilst on his side he reckons half the fair: In Britain's lovely isle a shining throng War in his cause, a thousand beauties strong. Th'unthinking victors vainly boast their pow'rs; Be theirs the musket, while the tongue is ours. We reason with such fluency and fire, The beaux we baffle, and the learned tire, Against the prelates plead the church's cause, And from our judges vindicate the laws. Then mourn not, hapless prince, thy kingdoms lost, A crown, tho' late, thy sacred brow may boast; Heav'n seems through us thy empire to decree, Those who win hearts, have giv'n their hearts to thee. Hast thou not heard that, when profusely gay, Our well-dress'd rivals grace their sov'reign's day, We stubborn damsels met the publick view In loathsome wormwood, and repenting rue? What whig but trembled, when our spotless band In virgin roses whiten'd half the land! Who can forget what fears the foe possess'd, When oaken boughs mark'd ev'ry loyal breast! Less scar'd near Medway's stream the Norman stood, When cross the plain he spy'd a marching wood, 'Till near at hand, a gleam of swords betray'd The youth of Kent beneath its wand'ring shade. Those, who the succours of the fair despise, May find that we have nails as well as eyes. The female bands, O prince by Fortune cross'd, At least more courage than thy men may boast; Our sex has dar'd the mug-house chiefs to meet, And purchase fame in many a well-fought street. From Drury-lane, the region of renown, The land of love, the Paphos of the town, Fair patriots sallying oft have put to flight With all their poles the guardians of the night, And borne, with screams of triumph, to their side The leader's staff in all its painted pride. Nor fears the hawker in her warbling note To vend the discontented statesman's thought. Tho' red with stripes, and recent from the thong, Sore smitten for the love of sacred song, The tuneful sisters still pursue their trade, Like Philomela darkling in the shade. Poor Trott attends, forgetful of a fare, And hums in concert o'er his empty chair. Mean while, regardless of the royal cause, His sword for James no brother sovereign draws. The Pope himself surrounded with alarms, To France his bulls, to Corfu sends his arms, And though he hears his darling son's complaint, Can hardly spare one tutelary saint; But lists them all to guard his own abodes, And into ready money coins his gods. The dauntless Swede, pursu'd by vengeful foes, Scarce keeps his own hereditary snows; Nor must the friendly roof of kind Lorrain With feast regale our garter'd youth again: Safe, Bar-le-duc, within thy silent grove The pheasant now may perch, the hare may rove: The knight, who aims unerring from afar, Th'advent'rous knight, now quits the sylvan war: The brinded boars may slumber un-dismay'd, Or grunt secure beneath the chesnut shade. Inconstant Orleans (still we mourn the day That trusted Orleans with imperial sway) Far o'er the Alps our helpless monarch sends, Far from the call of his desponding friends. Such are the terms to gain Britannia's grace! And such the terrors of the Brunswick race! Was it for this the sun's whole lustre fail'd, And sudden midnight o'er the noon prevail'd! For this did heav'n display to mortal eyes Aërial knights and combats in the skies? Was it for this Northumbrian streams look'd red, And Thames driv'n backward show'd his secret bed! False auguries! th'insulting victors scorn! Ev'n our own prodigies against us turn! O portents constru'd on our side in vain! Let never Tory trust eclipse again! Run clear, ye fountains! be at peace, ye skies! And, Thames, henceforth to thy green borders rise! To Rome then must the royal wand'rer go, And fall a suppliant at the papal toe? His life in sloth inglorious must he wear, One half in luxury, and one in pray'r? His mind perhaps at length, debauch'd with ease, The proffer'd purple and the hat may please. Shall he, whose ancient patriarchal race To mighty Nimrod in one line we trace, In solemn conclave sit, devoid of thought, And poll for points of faith his trusty vote! Be summon'd to his stall in time of need, And with his casting suffrage fix a creed! Shall he in robes on stated days appear, And English hereticks curse once a year! Garnet and Faux shall he with pray'rs invoke, And beg that Smithfield piles once more may smoak! Forbid it heav'n! my soul, to fury wrought, Turns almost Hanoverian at the thought. From James and Rome I feel my heart decline, And fear, O Brunswick, 'twill be wholly thine; Yet still his share thy rival will contest, And still the double claim divides my breast: The fate of James with pitying eyes I view, And wish my homage were not Brunswick's due; To James my passions and my weakness guide, But reason sways me to the victor's side. Though griev'd I speak it, let the truth appear; (You know my language, and my heart, sincere.) In vain did falshood his fair fame disgrace; What force had falshood, when he show'd his face! In vain to war our boastful clans were led; Heaps driven on heaps, in the dire shock they fled: France shuns his wrath, nor raises to our shame A second Dunkirk in another name: In Britain's funds their wealth all Europe throws, And up the Thames the world's abundance flows: Spite of feign'd fears, and artificial cries, The pious town sees fifty churches rise: The hero triumphs as his worth is known, And sits more firmly on his shaken throne. To my sad thought no beam of hope appears Through the long prospect of succeeding years; The son aspiring to his father's fame, Shows all his sire: another and the same. He blest in lovely Carolina's arms, To future ages propagates her charms: With pain and joy at strife, I often trace The mingled parents in each daughter's face; Half sick'ning at the sight, too well I spie The father's spirit through the mother's eye: In vain new thoughts of rage I entertain, And strive to hate their innocence in vain. O princess! happy by thy foes confess'd! Blest in thy husband! in thy children blest! As they from thee, from them new beauties born, While Europe lasts, shall Europe's thrones adorn. Transplanted to each court, in times to come, Thy smile celestial and un-fading bloom Great Austria's sons with softer lines shall grace, And smooth the frowns of Bourbon's haughty race. The fair descendents of thy sacred bed Wide-branching o'er the western world shall spread, Like the fam'd Banian tree, whose pliant shoot To earthward bending of itself takes root, Till like their mother plant, ten thousand stand In verdant arches on the fertile land; Beneath her shade the tawny Indians rove, Or hunt at large through the wide echoing grove. O thou, to whom these mournful lines I send, My promis'd husband, and my dearest friend; Since heav'n appoints this favour'd race to reign, And blood has drench'd the Scottish fields in vain; Must I be wretched, and thy flight partake? Or wilt not thou, for thy lov'd Chloe's sake, Tir'd out at length, submit to Fate's decree? If not to Brunswick, O return to me! Prostrate before the victor's mercy bend: What spares whole thousands, may to thee extend. Should blinded friends thy doubtful conduct blame, Great Brunswick's virtues will secure thy fame: Say, these invite thee to approach his throne, And own the monarch heav'n vouchsafes to own. The world, convinc'd, thy reasons will approve; Say this to Them; but swear to Me 'twas love. THE FEMALE REIGN: AN ODE. By Mr. COBB. I. What can the British senate give, To make the name of Anna live, By future people to be sung, The labour of each grateful tongue? Can faithful registers, or rhyme, In charming eloquence, or sprightly wit, The wonders of her reign transmit To th'unborn children of succeeding time? Can painters' oil, or statuaries' art, Eternity to her impart? No! titled statues are but empty things, Inscrib'd to royal vanity, The sacrifice of flattery To lawless Neros, or Bourbonian kings. True virtue to her kindred stars aspires, Does all our pomp of stone and verse surpass, And mingling with etherial fires, No useless ornament requires From speaking colours, or from breathing brass. II. Greatest of princes! where the wand'ring sun Does o'er earth's habitable regions roll, From th'eastern barriers to the western goal, And sees thy race of glory run With swiftness equal to his own: Thee on the banks of Flandrian Scaldis sings The jocund swain releas'd from Gallic fear: The English voice unus'd to hear, Thee the repeating banks, thee ev'ry valley rings. III. The sword of heav'n how pious Anna wields, And heav'nly vengeance on the guilty deals, Let the twice fugitive Bavarian tell; Who, from his airy hope of better state, By lust of sway irregularly great, Like an apostate angel fell: Who, by imperial favour rais'd, I'th' highest rank of glory blaz'd: And had till now unrivall'd shone, More than a king contented with his own; But Lucifer's bold steps he trod, Who durst assault the throne of God; And for contented realms of blissful light, Gain'd the sad privilege to be The first in solid misery, Monarch of hell, and woes, and everlasting night. Corruption of the best is always worst; And foul ambition like an evil wind, Blights the fair blossoms of a noble mind; And if a seraph fall, he's doubly curst. IV. Had guile, and pride, and envy grown In the black groves of Styx alone, Nor ever had on earth the baleful crop been sown: The swain without amaze, had till'd The Flandrian glebe, a guiltless field: Nor had he wonder'd, when he found The bones of heroes in the ground: No crimson streams had lately swell'd The Dyle, the Danube, and the Scheld. But evils are of necessary growth, To rouze the brave, and banish sloth; And some are born to win the stars, By sweat and blood, and worthy scars. Heroick virtue is by action seen, And vices serve to make it keen; And as gigantick tyrants rise, Nassaus and Churchills leave the skies, The earth-born monsters to chastise. V. If, heav'nly Muse, you burn with a desire To praise the man whom all admire; Come from thy learn'd Castalian springs, And stretch aloft thy Pegasean wings: Strike the loud Pindarick strings, Like the lark who soars and sings; And as you sail the liquid skies, Cast on The Menapii were the ancient inhabitants of Flanders. Menapian fields your weeping eyes: For weep they surely must, To see the bloody annual sacrifice; To think how the neglected dust, Which with contempt is basely trod, Was once the limbs of captains, brave and just, The mortal part of some great demi-god; Who for thrice fifty years of stubborn war, With slaught'ring arms, the gun and sword, Have dug the mighty sepulchre, And fell as martyrs on record, Of tyranny aveng'd, and liberty restor'd. VI. See, where at Audenard, with heaps of slain, Th'heroick man inspir'dly brave, Mowing across, bestrews the plain, And with new tenants crowds the wealthy grave. His mind unshaken at the frightful scene, His looks as chearfully serene, The routed battle to pursue, As once adorn'd the Paphian queen, When to her Thracian paramour she flew. The gath'ring troops he kens from far, And with a bridegroom's passion and delight, Courting the war, and glowing for the fight, The new Salmoneus meets the Celtic thunderer. Ah, cursed pride! infernal dream! Which drove him to this wild extream, That dust a deity should seem; Be thought, as through the wondering streets he rode, A man immortal, or a god: With rattling brass, and trampling horse, Should counterfeit th'inimitable force Of divine thunder: horrid crime! But vengeance is the child of time, And will too surely be repaid On his profane devoted head, Who durst affront the powers above, And their eternal flames disgrace, Too fatal, brandish'd by the real Jove, Or Vicem gerit illa Tonantis. Pallas, who assumes and fills his aweful place: VII. The British Pallas! who, as Homer, in his fifth Iliad, because his hero is to do wonders beyond the power of man, premises, in the beginning, that Pallas had peculiarly fitted him for that day's exploits. Homer's did For her lov'd Diomede, Her hero's mind with wisdom fills, And heav'nly courage in his heart instils. Hence thro' the thickest squadrons does he ride, With Anna's angels by his side. With what uncommon speed He spurs his foaming, fiery steed, And pushes on thro' midmost fires, Where France's fortune, with her sons, retires! Now here, now there, the sweeping ruin flies; Indomitas prope qualis undas Exercit auster, pleiadum choro Scindente nubes, impiger hostium Vexare turmas, &amp; frementem Mittere equum medios per ignes. Sic tauriformis volvitur Aufidus, Qui regna Dauni præfluit Appuli, Cum sævit, horrendam quo cultis Diluviem meditatur agris.As when the Pleiades arise, The southern wind afflicts the skies, Then, mutt'ring o'er the deep, buffets th'unruly brine, 'Till clouds and water seem to join. Or as a dyke cut by malicious hands, O'erflows the fertile Netherlands; Thro' the wide yawn, th'impetuous sea, Lavish of his new liberty, Bestrides the vale, and, with tumultuous noise, Bellows along the delug'd plain Pernicious to the rip'ning grain; Far as th'horizon he destroys: The weeping shepherd from an hill bewails the wat'ry reign. VIII. So rapid flows the unimprison'd stream! So strong the force of Mindelheim! In vain the woods of Audenard Would shield the Gaul, a senceless guard. As soon may whirl-winds be with-held, As Marlb'rough's footsteps o'er the foaming Scheld. In vain the torrent would oppose, In vain arm'd banks, and hosts of foes: The foes with coward-haste retire, Fly faster than the river flows, And swifter than our fire. Vendosme from far upbraids their shame, And pleads his royal master's fame. “By Condè's mighty ghost,” he cries, “By Turenne, Luxemburgh, and all “Those noble souls, who fell a sacrifice “At Near this place the prince of Condè gave the Spaniards a very great overthrow, 1648. Lens, at Fleurus, and at Landen fight, “Stop, I conjure, your ignominious flight.” But Fear is deaf to Honour's call. Each frowning threat and soothing pray'r Is lost in the regardless air: As well he may The billows of the ocean stay; While Churchill like a driving wind, Or high spring-tide, pursues behind, And with redoubled speed urges their forward way. IX. Nor less, Eugenius, thy important care, Thou second thunder-bolt of war! Partner in danger and in fame, The wind, with Marlborough's, shall bear To distant colonies thy conqu'ring name. Nor shall my Muse forget to sing From harmony what blessings spring: To tell how Death did enviously repine, To see a friendship so divine; When in a ball's destroying form she past, And mark'd thy threaten'd brow at last, But durst not touch that sacred brain, Where Europe's mightiest counsels reign; For strait she bow'd her ghastly head, She saw the mark of heav'n, and fled, As cruel Brennus once, insulting Gaul, When he, at Allia's fatal flood, Had fill'd the plains with Roman blood, With conscious awe forsook the capitol, Where Jove, revenger of profaneness, stood. X. But where the good and brave command, What capitol, what bulwark can withstand? Virtue, approv'd of heav'n, can pass Thro' walls, thro' tow'rs, and gates of brass. Lisle, like a mistress, had been courted long, By all the valiant and the young, The fairest progeny of Vauban's art; 'Till Savoy's warlike prince withstood Her frowning terrors, and thro' seas of blood Tore the bright darling from th'old tyrant's heart. Such He bore a considerable share in the glory of that day on which Buda was taken. Buda saw him, when proud He was Bassau of the city, and lost his life on the breach. Apti fell, Unhappy, valiant infidel! Who, vanquish'd by superior strength, Surrender'd up his haughty breath, Upon the breach measuring his manly length, And shun'd the bow-string by a nobler death. XI. Such This was the fatal battle to the Turks in the year 1687. Prince Eugene, with the regiments of his brigade, was the first that entered the trenches; and for that reason had the honour to be the first messenger of this happy news to the emperor. Harscam's field beheld him in his bloom, When Victory bespoke him for her own. Her favourite, immortal son, And told of better years revolving on the loom: How he should make the Turkish crescent wane, And choak This battle was fought on the 10th of October, 1697, where Prince Eugene commanded in chief; like which there never happened so great and so terrible a destruction to the Ottoman army, which fell upon the principal commanders more than the common soldiers; for no less than fifteen Bassaus (five of which had been Viziers of the bench) were killed, besides the supreme Vizier. Tibiscus with the slain; While Viziers lay beneath the lofty pile Of slaughter'd Bassaus, who o'er Bassaus roll'd; And all his num'rous acts she told, From Latian Carpi down to Flandrian Lisle. XII. Honour, with open arms, receives at last The heroes who thro' Virtue's temple past; And show'rs down laurels from above, On those whom heav'n and Anna love. And some, not sparingly, she throws For the young eagles, who could try The faith and judgment of the sky, And dare the sun with steady eye; For Hanover's and Prussia's brows, Eugenes in bloom, and future Marlboroughs: To Hanover, to Brunswick's second grace, Descendent from a long imperial race, The Muse directs her honourable flight, And prophesies, from so serene a morn, To what clear glories he is born, When blazing with a full meridian light, He shall the British hemisphere adorn; When Mars shall lay his batter'd target down, And he, (since Death will never spare The good, the pious, and the fair) In his ripe harvest of renown, Shall after his great father sit, (If heav'n so long a life permit) And having swell'd the flowing tide Of fame, which he in arms shall get, The purchase of an honest sweat, Shall safe in stormy seas Britannia's vessel guide. XIII. Britannia's vessel, which in Anna's reign, And prudent pilotry, enjoys The tempest which the world destroys, And rides triumphant o'er the subject main. O may she soon a quiet harbour gain! And sure the promis'd hour is come, When in soft notes the peaceful lyre Shall still the trumpet and the drum, Shall play what gods and men desire, And strike Bellona's musick dumb: When War, by parents curs'd, shall quit the field, Unbuckle his bright helmet, and, to rest His weary'd limbs, sit on his idle shield, With scars of honour plow'd upon his breast. But if the Gallic Pharaoh's stubborn heart Grows fresh for punishment, and hardens still; Prepar'd for th'irrecoverable ill, And forc'd th'unwilling skies to act the last ungrateful part: Thy forces, Anna, like a flood, shall whelm (If heav'n does scepter'd innocence maintain) His famish'd desolated realm; And all the sons of Pharamond in vain (Who with dishonest envy see The sweet forbidden fruits of distant liberty) Shall curse their Salic law, and wish a female reign. XIV. A female reign like thine, O Anna, British heroine! To thee afflicted empires fly for aid, Where'er tyrannick standards are display'd, From the wrong'd Iber to the threaten'd Rhine. Thee, where the golden-sanded Tagus flows Beneath fair The old name of Lisbon, said to be built by Ulysses. Ulyssippo's walls, The frighted Lusitanian calls; Thee they who drink the Seine, with those Who plow Iberian fields, implore, To give the lab'ring world repose, And universal peace restore: Thee, Gallia; mournful to survive the fate Of her fall'n grandeur and departed state; By sad experience taught to own, That virtue is a noble way to rise, A surer passage to the skies, Than Pelion upon Ossa thrown: For they, who impiously presume To grasp at heav'n, by Jove's eternal doom, A prey to thunder shall become; Or, sent in One of the mountains where Jupiter lodged the giants. Ætna's fiery caves to groan, Gain but an higher fall, a mountain for their tomb. SIX TOWN ECLOGUES. By the Right Hon. L. M. W. M. MONDAY. Roxana, or, the Drawing-Room. Roxana from the court retiring late, Sigh'd her soft sorrows at St. James's gate. Such heavy thoughts lay brooding in her breast, Not her own chairmen with more weight oppress'd; They groan the cruel load they doom'd to bear; She in these gentle sounds express'd her care. “Was it for this, that I these roses wear, “For this new-set the jewels for my hair? “Ah! princess! with what zeal have I pursu'd! “Almost forgot the duty of a prude. “Thinking I never cou'd attend too soon, “I've miss'd my prayers, to get me dress'd by noon. “For thee, ah! what for thee did I resign? “My pleasures, passions, all that e'er was mine. “I sacrific'd both modesty and ease, “Left operas, and went to filthy plays; “Double entendres shock'd my tender ear, “Yet even this for thee I chose to bear. “In glowing youth, when nature bids be gay, “And every joy of life before me lay, “By honour prompted, and by pride restrain'd, “The pleasures of the young my soul disdain'd: “Sermons I sought, and with a mein severe “Censur'd my neighbours, and said daily pray'r. “Alas! how chang'd!—with the same sermon-mein “That once I pray'd, the What-d'ye-call't I've seen “Ah! cruel princess, for thy sake I've lost “That reputation which so dear had cost: “I, who avoided every publick place, “When bloom and beauty bade me show my face; “Now near thee constant ev'ry night abide “With never-failing duty by thy side, “Myself and daughters standing on a row, “To all the foreigners a goodly show! “Oft had your drawing-room been sadly thin, “And merchants' wives close by the chair been seen; “Had not I amply fill'd the empty space, “And sav'd your highness from the dire disgrace. “Yet Coquetilla's artifice prevails, “When all my merit and my duty fails: “That Coquetilla, whose deluding airs “Corrupts our virgins, and our youth ensnares; “So sunk her character, so lost her fame, “Scarce visited before your highness came: “Yet for the bed-chamber 'tis her you chuse, “When Zeal and Fame and Virtue you refuse. “Ah! worthy choice! not one of all your train “Whom censure blasts not, and dishonours stain. “Let the nice hind now suckle dirty pigs, “And the proud pea-hen hatch the cuckoo's eggs! “Let Iris leave her paint and own her age, “And grave Suffolka wed a giddy page! “A greater miracle is daily view'd, “A virtuous princess with a court so lewd. “I know thee, Court! with all thy treach'rous wiles, “Thy false caresses and undoing smiles! “Ah! princess, learn'd in all the courtly arts “To cheat our hopes, and yet to gain our hearts! “Large lovely bribes are the great statesman's aim; “And the neglected patriot follows fame. “The prince is ogled; some the king pursue; “But your Roxana only follows You. “Despis'd Roxana, cease, and try to find “Some other, since the princess proves unkind; “Perhaps it is not hard to find at court, “If not a greater, a more firm support.” TUESDAY. St. James's Coffee-House. Silliander and Patch. Thou, who so many favours hast receiv'd, Wond'rous to tell, and hard to be believ'd, Oh! H?d, to my lays attention lend, Hear how too lovers boastingly contend: Like thee successful, such their bloomy youth, Renown'd alike for gallantry and truth. St. James's bell had toll'd some wretches in, (As tatter'd riding-hoods alone could sin) The happier sinners now their charms put out, And to their manteaus their complexions suit; The opera queens had finished half their faces, And city-dames already taken places; Fops of all kinds, to see the Lion, run; The beauties stay till the first act's begun, And beaux step home to put fresh linen on. No well-dress'd youth in coffee-house remain'd, But pensive Patch, who on the window lean'd; And Silliander, that alert and gay, First pick'd his teeth, and then began to say. Silliander. Why all these sighs; ah! why so pensive grown? Some cause there is why thus you sit alone. Does hapless passion all this sorrow move? Or dost thou envy where the ladies love? Patch. If, whom they love, my envy must pursue, 'Tis true, at least, I never envy you. Silliander. No, I'm unhappy—you are in the right— 'Tis you they favour, and 'tis me they slight. Yet I could tell, but that I hate to boast, A club of ladies where 'tis me they toast. Patch. Toasting does seldom any favour prove; Like us, they never toast the thing they love. A certain duke one night my health begun; With chearful pledges round the room it run, Till the young Sylvia, press'd to drink it too, Started and vow'd she knew not what to do: What, drink a fellow's health! she dy'd with shame: Yet blush'd whenever she pronounc'd my name. Silliander. Ill fates pursue me, may I never find The dice propitious, or the ladies kind, If fair Miss Flippy's fan I did not tear, And one from me she condescends to wear. Patch. Women are always ready to receive; 'Tis then a favour when the sex will give. A lady (but she is too great to name) Beauteous in person, spotless in her fame, With gentle strugglings let me force this ring; Another day may give another thing. Silliander. I cou'd say something—see this billet-doux— And as for presents—look upon my shoe— These buckles were not forc'd, nor half a theft, But a young countess fondly made the gift. Patch. My countess is more nice, more artful too, Affects to fly, that I may fierce pursue: This snuff-box which I begg'd, she still deny'd, And when I strove to snatch it, seem'd to hide; She laugh'd and fled, and as I sought to seize, With affectation cram'd it down her stays; Yet hope she did not place it there unseen, I press'd her breasts, and pull'd it from between. Silliander. Last night, as I stood ogling of her grace, Drinking delicious poison from her face, The soft enchantress did that face decline, Nor ever rais'd her eyes to meet with mine; With sudden art some secret did pretend, Lean'd cross two chairs to whisper to a friend, While the stiff whalebone with the motion rose, And thousand beauties to my sight expose. Patch. Early this morn—(but I was ask'd to come) I drank bohea in Cælia's dressing-room: Warm from her bed, to me alone within, Her night-gown fasten'd with a single pin; Her night-cloaths tumbled with resistless grace, And her bright hair play'd careless round her face; Reaching the kettle made her gown unpin, She wore no waistcoat, and her shift was thin. Silliander. See Titiana, driving to the park! Hark! let us follow, 'tis not yet too dark; In her all beauties of the spring are seen, Her cheeks are rosy, and her mantle green. Patch. See Tintoretta to the opera goes! Haste, or the crowd will not permit our bows; In her the glory of the heav'ns we view, Her eyes are star-like, and her mantle blue. Silliander, What colour does in Cælia's stockings shine? Reveal that secret, and the prize is thine. Patch. What are her garters? tell me if you can; I'll freely own thee far the happier man Thus Patch continued his heroick strain, While Silliander but contends in vain, After a conquest so important gain'd, Unrival'd Patch in ev'ry ruelle reign'd. WEDNESDAY. The Tête à Tête. Dancinda. “No, fair Dancinda, no; you strive in vain “To calm my care and mitigate my pain; “If all my sighs, my cares, can fail to move, “Ah! sooth me not with fruitless vows of love.” Thus Strephon spoke. Dancinda thus reply'd: What must I do to gratify your pride? Too well you know (ungrateful as thou art) How much you triumph in this tender heart: What proof of love remains for me to grant? Yet still you tease me with some new complaint. Oh! would to heav'n!—but the fond wish is vain— Too many favours had not made it plain! But such a passion breaks through all disguise, Love reddens on my cheek and wishes in my eyes. Is't not enough (inhuman and unkind!) I own the secret conflict of my mind; You cannot know what secret pain I prove, When I with burning blushes own I love. You see my artless joy at your approach, I sigh, I faint, I tremble at your touch; And in your absence all the world I shun; I hate mankind, and curse the chearing sun. Still as I fly, ten thousand swains pursue; Ten thousand swains I sacrifice to you. I shew you all my heart without disguise: But these are tender proofs that you despise— I see too well what wishes you pursue; You wou'd not only conquer, but undo: You, cruel victor, weary of your flame, Would seek a cure in my eternal shame; And not content my honour to subdue, Now strive to triumph o'er my virtue too. Oh! Love, a god indeed to womankind, Whose arrows burn me and whose fetters bind, Avenge thy altars, vindicate thy fame, And blast these traytors that profane thy name; Who by pretending to thy sacred fire, Raise cursed trophies to impure desire. Have you forgot with what ensnaring art You first seduc'd this fond uncautious heart? Then as I fled, did you not kneeling cry, “Turn, cruel beauty; whither wou'd you fly? “Why all these doubts? why this distrustful fear? “No impious wishes shall offend your ear: “Nor ever shall my boldest hopes pretend “Above the title of a tender friend; “Blest, if my lovely goddess will permit “My humble vows thus sighing at her feet. “The tyrant Love that in my bosom reigns, “The god himself submits to wear your chains. “You shall direct his course, his ardour tame, “And check the fury of his wildest flame.” Unpractis'd youth is easily deceiv'd; Sooth'd by such sounds, I listen'd and believ'd; Now quite forgot that soft submissive fear, You dare to ask what I must blush to hear. Cou'd I forget the honour of my race, And meet your wishes, fearless of disgrace; Cou'd passion o'er my tender youth prevail, And all my mother's pious maxims fail; Yet to preserve your heart (which still must be, False as it is, for ever dear to me) This fatal proof of love I would not give, Which you'd contemn the moment you receive. The wretched she, who yields to guilty joys, A man may pity, but he must despise. Your ardour ceas'd, I then shou'd see you shun The wretched victim by your arts undone. Yet if I cou'd that cold indifference bear, What more wou'd strike me with the last despair, With this reflection wou'd my soul be torn, To know I merited your cruel scorn. “Has love no pleasures free from guilt or fear? “Pleasures less fierce, more lasting, more sincere? “Thus let us gently kiss and fondly gaze, “Love is a child, and like a child it plays.” O Strephon, if you wou'd continue just, If love be something more than brutal lust, Forbear to ask what I must still deny, This bitter pleasure, this destructive joy, So closely follow'd by the dismal train Of cutting shame, and guilt's heart-piercing pain. She paus'd; and fix'd her eyes upon her fan; He took a pinch of snuff, and thus began; Madam, if love—but he cou'd say no more, For Mademoiselle came rapping at the door. The dangerous moments no adieus afford; —Begone, she cries, I'm sure I hear my lord. The lover starts from his unfinish'd loves, To snatch his hat, and seek his scatter'd gloves: The sighing dame to meet her dear prepares, While Strephon cursing slips down the back-stairs. THURSDAY. The Bassette-Table. Smilinda and Cardelia. Cardelia. The bassette-table spread, the tallier come, Why stays Smilinda in the dressing-room? Rise, pensive nymph! the tallier stays for you. Smilinda. Ah! Madam, since my Sharper is untrue, I joyless make my once ador'd alpieu. I saw him stand behind Ombrelia's chair, And whisper with that soft, deluding air, And those feign'd sighs, that cheat the list'ning fair. Cardelia. Is this the cause of your romantick strains? A mightier grief my heavy heart sustains. As you by Love, so I by Fortune cross'd, In one bad deal three septlevas I lost. Smilinda. Is that a grief which you compare with mine? With ease the smiles of Fortune I resign. Wou'd all my gold in one bad deal were gone, Were lovely Sharper mine, and mine alone. Cardelia. A lover lost is but a common care, And prudent nymphs against the change prepare. The queen of clubs thrice lost! oh! who cou'd guess This fatal stroke! this unforeseen distress! Smilinda. See! Betty Loveit very à propos! She all the pains of love and play does know, Deeply experienc'd many years ago. Dear Betty shall th'important point decide, Betty, who oft the pains of each has try'd: Impartial, she shall say who suffers most, By cards' ill-usage, or by lovers lost. Loveit. Tell, tell your griefs; attentive will I stay, Tho' time is precious, and I want some tea. Cardelia. Behold this equipage by Mathers wrought, With fifty guineas (a great pen'orth!) bought! See on the tooth-pick Mars and Cupid strive, And both the struggling figures seem to live. Upon the bottom see the queen's bright face; A myrtle foliage round the thimble case; Jove, Jove himself does on the scissars shine, The metal and the workmanship divine. Smilinda. This snuff-box, once the pledge of Sharper's love, When rival beauties for the present strove— (At Corticelli's he the raffle won, There first his passion was in publick shown: Hazardia blush'd, and turn'd her head aside, Her rival's envy all in vain to hide) This snuff-box—on the hinge see diamonds shine— This snuff-box will I stake, the prize is mine. Cardelia. Alas! far smaller losses than I bear, Have made a soldier sigh, a lover swear: But oh! what makes the disappointment hard, 'Twas my own lord who drew the fatal card!— In complaisance I took the queen he gave, Tho' my own secret wish was for the knave: The knave won son ecart that I had chose, And the next pull my septleva I lose. Smilinda. But ah! what aggravates the killing smart, The cruel thought that stabs me to the heart, This curs'd Ombrelia, this undoing fair, By whose vile arts this heavy grief I bear, She at whose name I shed these spiteful tears, She owes to me the very charms she wears: An aukward thing when first she came to town, Her shape unfashion'd, and her face unknown. She was my friend, I taught her first to spread Upon her sallow cheeks enlivening red; I introduc'd her to the park and plays, And by my int'rest Cosins made her stays. Ungrateful wretch! with mimick airs grown pert, She dares to steal my favourite lover's heart. Cardelia. Wretch that I was! how often have I swore, When Winnall tallied, I would punt no more! I know the bite, yet to my ruin run, And see the folly which I cannot shun. Smilinda. How many maids have Sharper's vows deceiv'd! How many curs'd the moment they believ'd! Yet his known falshood could no warning prove: Ah! what are warnings to a maid in love! Cardelia. But of what marble must that breast be form'd, To gaze on Bassette, and remain unwarm'd? When kings, queens, knaves, are set in decent rank, Expos'd in glorious heaps the tempting bank, Guineas, half-guineas, all the shining train, The winner's pleasure and the loser's pain, In bright confusion open rouleaus lie, They strike the soul, and glitter in the eye; Fir'd by the sight, all reason I disdain, My passions rise, and will not bear the rein: Look upon Bassette, you who reason boast, And see if reason may not there be lost. Smilinda. What more than marble must that breast compose, That listens coldly to my Sharper's vows! Then when he trembles, when his blushes rise, When aweful love seems melting in his eyes! With eager beats his Mechlin cravat moves; He loves, I whisper to myself, he loves! Such unfeign'd passion in his look appears, I lose all mem'ry of my former fears; My panting heart confesses all his charms; I yield at once, and sink into his arms. Think of that moment, you who prudence boast! For such a moment, prudence well were lost. Cardelia. At the groom-porter's, batter'd bullies play; Some dukes at Marybon bowl time away! But who the bowl or rattling dice compares To Bassette's heavenly joys and pleasing cares? Smilinda. Soft Simplicetta doats upon a beau; Prudina likes a man, and laughs at show: Their several graces in my Sharper meet; Strong as the footman, as the master sweet. Loveit. Cease your contention, which has been too long, I grow impatient, and the tea grows strong: Attend, and yield to what I now decide; The equipage shall grace Smilinda's side; The snuff-box to Cardelia I decree; So leave complaining, and begin your tea. FRIDAY. The Toilette. Lydia. Now twenty springs had cloth'd the park with green, Since Lydia knew the blossoms of fifteen; No lovers now her morning hours molest; And catch her at her toilette half undrest. The thund'ring knocker wakes the street no more, Nor chairs, nor coaches crowd the silent door; Nor at the window all her mornings pass, Or at the dumb devotion of her glass: Reclin'd upon her arm she pensive sate, And curs'd th'inconstancy of man too late. “Oh youth! O spring of life for ever lost! “No more my name shall reign the fav'rite toast; “On glass no more the diamond grave my name, “And lines mis-spelt record my lover's flame: “Nor shall side-boxes watch my wand'ring eyes, “And, as they catch the glance, in rows arise “With humble bows; nor white-glov'd beaus encroach “In crowds behind, to guard me to my coach. “What shall I do to spend the hateful day? “At chapel shall I wear the morn away? “Who there appears at these unmodish hours, “But ancient matrons with their frizled tow'rs, “And grey religious maids? my presence there “Amidst that sober train, would own despair; “Nor am I yet so old, nor is my glance “As yet fix'd wholly on devotion's trance. “Strait then I'll dress, and take my wonted range “Thro' India shops, to Motteux's, or the Change, “Where the tall jar erects its stately pride, “With antick shapes in China's azure dy'd; “There careless lies a rich brocade unroll'd, “Here shines a cabinet with burnish'd gold. “But then, alas! I must be forc'd to pay, “And bring no penn'orths, not a fan away! “How am I curs'd, unhappy and forlorn! “My lover's triumph, and my sex's scorn! “False is the pompous grief of youthful heirs; “False are the loose coquet's inveigling airs; “False is the crafty courtier's plighted word; “False are the dice, when gamesters stamp the board; “False is the sprightly widow's publick tear; “Yet these to Damon's oaths are all sincere. “For what young flirt, base man, am I abus'd? “To please your wife am I unkindly us'd? “'Tis true, her face may boast the peach's bloom; “But does her nearer whisper breathe perfume? “I own her taper shape is form'd to please; “But don't you see her unconfin'd by stays? “She doubly to fifteen may claim pretence; “Alike we read it in her face and sense. “Insipid, servile thing! whom I disdain! “Her phlegm can best support the marriage chain. “Damon is practis'd in the modish life; “Can hate, and yet be civil to his wife; “He games, he drinks, he swears, he sights, he roves “Yet Cloe can believe he fondly loves. “Mistress and wife by turns supply his need; “A miss for pleasure, and a wife for breed. “Powder'd with diamonds, free from spleen or care. “She can a sullen husband's humour bear; “Her credulous friendship, and her stupid ease, “Have often been my jest in happier days: “Now Cloe boasts and triumphs in my pains; “To her he's faithful; 'tis to me he feigns. “Am I that stupid thing to bear neglect, “And force a smile, not daring to suspect? “No, perjur'd man! a wife may be content, “But you shall find a mistress can resent.” Thus love-sick Lydia rav'd; her maid appears, And in her faithful hand the band-box bears; (The Cestos that reform'd inconstant Jove Not better fill'd with what allur'd to love) “How well this ribband's gloss becomes your face!” She cries in rapture; “then, so sweet a lace! “How charmingly you look! so bright! so fair! “'Tis to your eyes the head-dress owes its air!” Strait Lydia smil'd; the comb adjusts her locks; And at the play-house, Harry keeps her box. SATURDAY. The Small-Pox. Flavia. The wretched Flavia on her couch reclin'd, Thus breath'd the anguish of a wounded mind; A glass revers'd in her right hand she bore, For now she shun'd the face she sought before. ‘How am I chang'd! alas! how am I grown ‘A frightful spectre, to myself unknown! ‘Where's my complexion? where my radiant bloom, ‘That promis'd happiness for years to come? ‘Then with what pleasure I this face survey'd! ‘To look once more, my visits oft delay'd! ‘Charm'd with the view, a fresher red would rise, ‘And a new life shot sparkling from my eyes! ‘Ah! faithless glass, my wonted bloom restore; ‘Alas! I rave, that bloom is now no more. ‘The greatest good the gods on men bestow, ‘Ev'n youth itself to me is useless now. ‘There was a time (oh! that I cou'd forget!) ‘When opera-tickets pour'd before my feet; ‘And at the ring, where brightest beauties shine, ‘The earliest cherries of the spring were mine. ‘Witness, O Lilly; and thou, Motteux, tell, ‘How much japan these eyes have made ye sell. ‘With what contempt ye saw me oft despise ‘The humble offer of the raffled prize; ‘For at the raffle still each prize I bore, ‘With scorn rejected, or with triumph wore. ‘Now beauty's fled, and presents are no more! ‘For me the Patriot has the house forsook, ‘And left debates to catch a passing look: ‘For me the Soldier has soft verses writ: ‘For me the Beau has aim'd to be a wit. ‘For me the Wit to nonsense was betray'd; ‘The Gamester has for me his dun delay'd, ‘And overseen the card he would have play'd. ‘The bold and haughty by success made vain, ‘Aw'd by my eyes, have trembled to complain: ‘The bashful 'Squire touch'd by a wish unknown, ‘Has dar'd to speak with spirit not his own: ‘Fir'd by one wish, all did alike adore; ‘Now beauty's fled, and lovers are no more! ‘As round the room I turn my weeping eyes, ‘New unaffected scenes of sorrow rise. ‘Far from my sight that killing picture bear, ‘The face disfigure, and the canvas tear: ‘That picture, which with pride I us'd to show, ‘The lost resemblance but upbraids me now. ‘And thou, my toilette, where I oft have sate, ‘While hours unheeded pass'd in deep debate, ‘How curls should fall, or where a patch to place; ‘If blue or scarlet best became my face; ‘Now on some happier nymph your aid bestow; ‘On fairer heads, ye useless jewels, glow; ‘No borrow'd lustre can my charms restore; ‘Beauty is fled, and dress is now no more. ‘Ye meaner beauties, I permit ye shine; ‘Go, triumph in the hearts that once were mine; ‘But, 'midst your triumphs with confusion know, ‘'Tis to my ruin all your arms ye owe. ‘Wou'd pitying heav'n restore my wonted mien, ‘Ye still might move unthought of and unseen: ‘But oh, how vain, how wretched is the boast ‘Of beauty faded, and of empire lost! ‘What now is left but weeping, to deplore ‘My beauty fled, and empire now no more? ‘Ye cruel chymists, what with-held your aid! ‘Could no pomatums save a trembling maid? ‘How false and trifling is that art ye boast! ‘No art can give me back my beauty lost. ‘In tears, surrounded by my friends I lay, ‘Mask'd o'er, and trembled at the sight of day; ‘Mirmillio came my fortune to deplore, ‘(A golden-headed cane well carv'd he bore) ‘Cordials, he cry'd, my spirits must restore! ‘Beauty is fled, and spirit is no more! ‘Galen, the grave; officious Squirt was there, ‘With fruitless grief and unavailing care: ‘Machaon too, the great Machaon, known ‘By his red cloak and his superior frown; ‘And why, he cry'd, this grief and this despair, ‘You shall again be well, again be fair; ‘Believe my oath; (with that an oath he swore) ‘False was his oath; my beauty is no more! ‘Cease, hapless maid, no more thy tale pursue, ‘Forsake mankind, and bid the world adieu! ‘Monarchs and beauties rule with equal sway; ‘All strive to serve, and glory to obey: ‘Alike unpitied when depos'd they grow— ‘Men mock the idol of their former vow. ‘Adieu! ye parks!—in some obscure recess, ‘Where gentle streams will weep at my distress, ‘Where no false friend will in my grief take part, ‘And mourn my ruin with a joyful heart; ‘There let me live in some deserted place, ‘There hide in shades this lost inglorious face, ‘Plays, operas, circles, I no more must view! ‘My toilette, patches, all the world adieu! The LOVER: A Ballad. To Mr. C? By the Same. I At length, by much importunity press'd, Take, C?, at once the inside of my breast. This stupid indiff'rence so often you blame, Is not owing to nature, to fear, or to shame. I am not as cold as a virgin in lead, Nor is Sunday's sermon so strong in my head: I know but too well how time flies along, That we live but few years, and yet fewer are young. II But I hate to be cheated, and never will buy Long years of repentance for moments of joy. Oh! was there a man (but where shall I find Good sense and good-nature so equally join'd?) Would value his pleasure, contribute to mine; Not meanly would boast, nor lewdly design, Not over severe, yet not stupidly vain, For I would have the power, tho' not give the pain. III No pedant, yet learned; nor rake-helly gay, Or laughing because he has nothing to say; To all my whole sex, obliging and free, Yet never be fond of any but me; In public preserve the decorum that's just, And shew in his eyes he is true to his trust; Then rarely approach, and respectfully bow, But not fulsomely pert, nor fopishly low. IV But when the long hours of publick are past, And we meet with champagne and a chicken at last, May ev'ry fond pleasure that moment endear; Be banish'd afar both discretion and fear! Forgetting or scorning the airs of the crowd, He may cease to be formal, and I to be proud, Till lost in the joy, we confess that we live, And he may be rude, and yet I may forgive. V And that my delight may be solidly fix'd, Let the friend and the lover be handsomely mix'd, In whose tender bosom my soul may confide, Whose kindness can sooth me, whose counsel can guide. From such a dear lover, as here I describe, No danger should fright me, no millions should bribe; But till this astonishing creature I know, As I long have liv'd chaste, I will keep myself so. VI I never will share with the wanton coquet, Or be caught by a vain affectation of wit. The toasters and songsters may try all their art, But never shall enter the pass of my heart. I loath the lewd rake, the dress'd fopling despise: Before such pursuers the nice virgin flies: And as Ovid has sweetly in parables told, We harden like trees, and like rivers grow cold. The LADY's Resolve. Written extempore on a Window. By the Same. Whilst thirst of praise, and vain desire of fame, In every age, is every woman's aim; With courtship pleas'd, of silly toasters proud, Found of a train, and happy in a crowd; On each poor fool bestowing some kind glance, Each conquest owing to some loose advance; While vain coquets affect to be pursu'd, And think they're virtuous, if not grossly lewd: Let this great maxim be my virtue's guide; In part she is to blame that has been try'd— He comes too near that comes to be deny'd. The GENTLEMAN's Answer. Whilst pretty fellows think a woman's fame In every state and every age the same; With their own folly pleas'd the fair they toast, And where they least are happy, swear they're most; No difference making 'twixt coquet and prude; And her that seems, yet is not really lewd; While thus they think, and thus they vainly live, And taste no joys but what their fancy give: Let this great maxim be my action's guide, May I ne'er hope, tho' I am ne'er deny'd; Nor think a woman won, that's willing to be try'd. An EPISTLE to Lord B? By the Same. How happy you! who varied joys pursue; And every hour presents you something new? Plans, schemes, and models, all Palladio's art, For six long months have gain'd upon your heart; Of colonades, of corridores you talk, The winding stair-case and the cover'd walk; You blend the orders with Vitruvian toil, And raise with wond'rous joy the fancy'd pile: But the dull workman's slow performing hand But coldly executes his lord's command. With dirt and mortar soon you grow displeas'd, Planting succeeds, and avenues are rais'd, Canals are cut, and mountains level made; Bowers of retreat, and galleries of shade; The shaven turf presents a lively green; The bordering flow'rs in mystick knots are seen: With studied art on nature you refine— The spring beheld you warm in this design, But scarce the cold attacks your fav'rite trees, Your inclination fails, and wishes freeze. You quit the grove, so lately you admir'd; With other views your eager hopes are fir'd, Post to the city you direct your way; Not blooming paradise could bribe your stay: Ambition shews your power's brightest side; 'Tis meanly poor in solitude to hide. Tho' certain pains attend the cares of state, A good man owes his country to be great; Should act abroad the high distinguish'd part, Or shew at least the purpose of his heart. With thoughts like these the shining courts you seek; Full of new projects for almost a week: You then despise the tinsel glittering snare; Think vile mankind below a serious care. Life is too short for any distant aim; And cold the dull reward of future fame: Be happy then while yet you have to live; And love is all the blessing heav'n can give. Fir'd by new passion you address the fair; Survey the opera as a gay parterre: Young Cloe's bloom had made you certain prize, But for a side-long glance from Celia's eyes: Your beating heart acknowledges her power; Your eager eyes her lovely form devour; You feel the poison swelling in your breast, And all your soul by fond desire possess'd. In dying sighs a long three hours are past; To some assembly with impatient haste, With trembling hope, and doubtful fear you move, Resolv'd to tempt your fate, and own your love: But there Belinda meets you on the stairs, Easy her shape, attracting all her airs; A smile she gives, and with a smile can wound; Her melting voice has musick in the sound; Her every motion wears resistless grace; Wit in her mien, and pleasure in her face: Here while you vow eternity of love, Cloe and Celia unregarded move. Thus on the sands of Afric's burning plains, However deeply made, no long impress remains; The lightest leaf can leave its figure there; The strongest form is scattered by the air. So yielding the warm temper of your mind, So touch'd by ev'ry eye, so toss'd by wind; Oh! how unlike the heav'n my soul design'd! Unseen, unheard, the throng around me move; Not wishing praise, insensible of love: No whispers soften, nor no beauties fire; Careless I see the dance, and coldly hear the lyre. So num'rous herds are driven o'er the rock; No print is left of all the passing flock: So sings the wind around the solid stone: So vainly beat the waves with fruitless moan. Tedious the toil, and great the workman's care, Who dare attempt to fix impressions there: But should some swain more skilful than the rest, Engrave his name upon this marble breast, Not rolling ages cou'd deface that name; Thro' all the storms of life 'tis still the same: Tho' length of years with moss may shade the ground, Deep, tho' unseen, remains the secret wound. EPILOGUE To MARY, Queen of SCOTS. Design'd to be spoken by Mrs. OLDFIELD. By the Same. What cou'd luxurious woman wish for more, To fix her joys, or to extend her pow'r? Their every wish was in this Mary seen, Gay, witty, youthful, beauteous, and a queen. Vain useless blessings with ill conduct join'd! Light as the air, and fleeting as the wind. Whatever poets write, and lovers vow, Beauty, what poor omnipotence hast thou! Queen Bess had wisdom, council, power, and laws; How few espous'd a wretched beauty's cause! Learn thence, ye fair, more solid charms to prize, Contemn the idle flatt'ters of your eyes. The brightest object shines but while 'tis new; That influence lessens by familiar view. Monarchs and beauties rule with equal sway, All strive to serve, and glory to obey; Alike unpitied when depos'd they grow— Men mock the idol of their former vow. Two great examples have been shown to-day, To what sure ruin passion does betray; What long repentance to short joys is due; When reason rules, what glory does ensue. If you will love, love like Eliza then; Love for amusement, like those traytors men. Think that the pastime of a leisure hour She favour'd oft—but never shar'd her pow'r. The traveller by desart wolves pursu'd, If by his art the savage foe's subdu'd, The world will still the noble act applaud, Tho' victory was gain'd by needful fraud. Such is, my tender sex, our helpless case; And such the barbarous heart, hid by the begging face. By passion fir'd, and not with-held by shame, They cruel hunters are; we, trembling game. Trust me, dear ladies, (for I know 'em well) They burn to triumph, and they sigh to tell: Cruel to them that yield, cullies to them that sell. Believe me, 'tis by far the wiser course, Superior art should meet superior force: Hear, but be faithful to your int'rest still: Secure your hearts—then fool with whom you will. A RECEIPT to Cure the Vapours. Written to Lady J?n. By the Same. I Why will Delia thus retire, And idly languish life away? While the sighing crowd admire, 'Tis too soon for hartshorn tea. II All those dismal looks and fretting Cannot Damon's life restore; Long ago the worms have eat him, You can never see him more. III Once again consult your toilette, In the glass your face review: So much weeping soon will spoil it, And no spring your charms renew. IV I, like you, was born a woman, Well I know what vapours mean: The disease, alas! is common; Single, we have all the spleen. V All the morals that they tell us, Never cur'd the sorrow yet: Chuse, among the pretty fellows, One of honour, youth, and wit. VI Prithee hear him every morning, At the least an hour or two; Once again at night returning— I believe the dose will do. The SPLEEN. An EPISTLE to Mr. C? J?. By Mr. Matthew Green of the Custom-house. This motly piece to you I send, Who always were a faithful friend; Who, if disputes should happen hence, Can best explain the author's sense; And, anxious for the public weal, Do, what I sing, so often feel. The want of method pray excuse, Allowing for a vapour'd Muse; Nor to a narrow path confin'd, Hedge in by rules a roving mind. The child is genuine, you may trace Throughout the sire's transmitted face. Nothing is stol'n: my Muse, tho' mean, Draws from the spring she finds within; Nor vainly buys what Gildon sells, Poetick buckets for dry wells. School-helps I want, to climb on high, Where all the ancient treasures lie, And there unseen commit a theft On wealth in Greek exchequers left. Then where? from whom? what can I steal, Who only with the moderns deal? This were attempting to put on Raiment from naked bodies won: They safely sing before a thief, They cannot give who want relief; Some few excepted, names well known, And justly laurel'd with renown, Whose stamp of genius marks their ware, And theft detects: of theft beware; From Moore so lash'd, example fit, Shun petty larceny in wit. First know, my friend, I do not mean To write a treatise on the Spleen; Nor to prescribe when nerves convulse; Nor mend th'alarum watch, you pulse. If I am right, your question lay, What course I take to drive away The day-mare Spleen, by whose false pleas Men prove mere suicides in ease; And how I do myself demean In stormy world to live serene. When by its magick lantern Spleen With frightful figures spreads life's scene, And threat'ning prospects urg'd my fears, A stranger to the luck of heirs; Reason, some quiet to restore, Shew'd part was substance, shadow more; With Spleen's dead weight tho' heavy grown, In life's rough tide I sunk not down, But swam, till Fortune threw a rope, Buoyant on bladders fill'd with hope. I always choose the plainest food To mend viscidity of blood. Hail! water-gruel, healing power, Of easy access to the poor; Thy help love's confessors implore, And doctors secretly adore; To thee I fly, by thee dilute— Thro' veins my blood doth quicker shoot, And by swift current throws off clean Prolifick particles of Spleen. I never sick by drinking grow, Nor keep myself a cup too low, And seldom Cloe's lodgings haunt, Thrifty of spirits, which I want. Hunting I reckon very good To brace the nerves, and stir the blood; But after no field-honours itch, Atchiev'd by leaping hedge and ditch. While Spleen lies soft relax'd in bed, Or o'er coal fires inclines the head, Hygeia's sons with hound and horn, And jovial cry awake the morn. These see her from the dusky plight, Smear'd by th'embraces of the night, With roral wash redeem her face, And prove herself of Titan's race, And, mounting in loose robes the skies, Shed light and fragrance as she flies. Then horse and hound fierce joy display, Exulting at the Hark-away, And in pursuit o'er tainted ground From lungs robust field-notes resound. Then, as St. George the dragon slew, Spleen pierc'd, trod down, and dying view; While all their spirits are on wing, And woods, and hills, and vallies ring. To cure the mind's wrong biass, Spleen; Some recommend the bowling-green; Some, hilly walks; all, exercise; Fling but a stone, the giant dies; Laugh and be well. Monkeys have been Extreme good doctors for the Spleen; And kitten, if the humour hit, Has harlequin'd away the fit. Since mirth is good in this behalf, At some partic'lars let us laugh. Witlings, brisk fools, curs'd with half sense, That stimulates their impotence; Who buz in rhyme, and, like blind flies, Err with their wings for want of eyes. Poor authors worshipping a calf; Deep tragedies that make us laugh, A strict dissenter saying grace, A lect'rer preaching for a place; Folks, things prophetick to dispense, Making the past the future tense, The popish dubbing of a priest, Fine epitaphs on knaves deceas'd, Green-apron'd Pythonissa's rage, Great Æsculapius on his stage, A miser starving to be rich, The prior of Newgate's dying speech, A jointur'd widow's ritual state, Two Jews disputing tête à tête, New almanacks compos'd by seers, Experiments on felons ears, Disdainful prudes, who ceaseless ply The superb muscle of the eye, A coquet's April-weather face, A Queenb'rough mare behind his mace, And fops in military show, Are so'vreign for the case in view. If Spleen-fogs rise at close of day, I clear my ev'ning with a play, Or to some concert take my way. The company, the shine of lights, The scenes of humour, musick's flights, Adjust and set the soul to rights. Life's moving pictures, well-wrought plays, To others' griefs attention raise: Here, while the tragick fictions glow, We borrow joy by pitying woe; There gaily comick scenes delight, And hold true mirrors to our sight. Virtue in charming dress array'd, Calling the passions to her aid, When moral scenes just actions join, Takes shape, and shews her face divine. Musick has charms, we all may find, Ingratiate deeply with the mind. When art does sound's high pow'r advance, To musick's pipe the passions dance; Motions unwill'd its pow'rs have shewn, Tarantulated by a tune. Many have held the soul to be Nearly ally'd to harmony. Her have I known indulging grief, And shunning company's relief, Unveil her face, and looking round, Own, by neglecting sorrow's wound, The consanguinity of sound. In rainy days keep double guard, Or Spleen will surely be too hard; Which, like those fish by sailors met, Fly highest, while their wings are wet. In such dull weather, so unfit To enterprize a work of wit, When clouds one yard of azure sky, That's fit for simile, deny, I dress my face with studious looks, And shorten tedious hours with books. But if dull fogs invade the head, That mem'ry minds not what is read, I sit in window dry as ark, And on the drowning world remark: Or to some coffee-house I stray For news, the manna of a day, And from the hipp'd discourses gather, That politicks go by the weather: Then seek good-humour'd tavern chums, And play at cards, but for small sums; Or with the merry fellows quaff, And laugh aloud with them that laugh; Or drink a joco-serious cup With souls who've took their freedom up, And let my mind, beguil'd by talk, In Epicurus' garden walk, Who thought it heav'n to be serene, Pain hell; and purgatory spleen. Sometimes I dress, with women sit, And chat away the gloomy fit; Quit the stiff garb of serious sense, And wear a gay impertinence, Nor think, nor speak with any pains, But lay on fancy's neck the reins; Talk of unusual swell of waist In maid of honour loosely lac'd, And beauty borr'wing Spanish red, And loving pair with sep'rate bed, And jewels pawn'd for loss of game, And then redeem'd by loss of fame; Of Kitty (aunt left in the lurch By grave pretence to go to church) Perceiv'd in hack with lover fine, Like Will and Mary on the coin: And thus in modish manner we, In aid of sugar, sweeten tea. Permit, ye fair, your idol form Which e'en the coldest heart can warm, May with its beauties grace my line, While I bow down before its shrine, And your throng'd altars with my lays Perfume, and get by giving praise. With speech so sweet, so sweet a mien You excommunicate the Spleen, Which, fiend-like, flies the magick ring You form with sound, when pleas'd to sing; Whate'er you say, howe'er you move, We look, we listen, and approve. Your touch, which gives to feeling bliss, Our nerves officious throng to kiss; By Celia's pat, on their report, The grave-air'd soul, inclin'd to sport, Renounces wisdom's sullen pomp, And loves the floral game, to romp. But who can view the pointed rays, That from black eyes scintillant blaze? Love on his throne of glory seems Encompass'd with Satellite beams. But when blue eyes, more softly bright, Diffuse benignly humid light, We gaze, and see the smiling loves, And Cytherea's gentle doves, And raptur'd fix in such a face, Love's mercy-seat, and throne of grace. Shine but on age, you melt its snow; Again sires long-extinguish'd glow, And, charm'd by witchery of eyes, Blood long congealed liquifies: True miracle, and fairly done By heads which are ador'd while on. But oh, what pity 'tis to find Such beauties both of form and mind, By modern breeding much debas'd, In half the female world at least! Hence I with care such lott'ries shun, Where, a priz'd miss'd, I'm quite undone; And han't, by vent'ring on a wife, Yet run the greatest risk in life. Mothers, and guardian aunts, forbear Your impious pains to form the fair, Nor lay out so much cost and art, But to deflow'r the virgin heart; Of ev'ry folly-fost'ring bed By quick'ning heat of custom bred. Rather than by your culture spoil'd, Desist, and give us nature wild, Delighted with a hoyden soul, Which truth and innocence controul. Coquets, leave off affected arts, Gay fowlers at a flock of hearts; Woodcocks to shun your snares have skill, You shew so plain, you strive to kill. In love the artless catch the game, And they scarce miss who never aim. The world's great Author did create The sex to fit the nuptial state, And meant a blessing in a wife To solace the fatigues of life; And old inspired times display, How wives could love, and yet obey. Then truth and patience of controul, And house-wife arts adorn'd the soul; And charms, the gift of nature, shone; And jealousy, a thing unknown: Veils were the only masks they wore; Novels (receipts to make a whore) Nor ombre, nor quadrille they knew, Nor Pam's puissance felt at loo. Wise men did not, to be thought gay, Then compliment their pow'r away: But lest, by frail desires misled, The girls forbidden paths should tread, Of ign'rance rais'd the safe high wall; We sink haw-haws, that shew them all. Thus we at once solicit sense, And charge them not to break the fence. Now, if untir'd, consider friend, What I avoid to gain my end. I never am at Meeting seen, Meeting, that region of the Spleen; The broken heart, the busy fiend, The inward call, on Spleen depend. Law, licens'd breaking of the peace, To which vacation is disease; A gypsy diction scarce known well By th'magi, who law-fortunes tell I shun; nor let it breed within Anxiety, and that the Spleen; Law, grown a forest, where perplex The mazes, and the brambles vex; Where its twelve verd'rers every day Are changing still the publick way; Yet if we miss our path and err, We grievous penalties incur; And wand'rers tire, and tear their skin, And then get out where they went in. I never game, and rarely bet, Am loth to lend, or run in debt. No compter-writs me agitate; Who moralizing pass the gate, And there mine eyes on spendthrifts turn, Who vainly o'er their bondage mourn. Wisdom, before beneath their care, Pays her upbraiding visits there, And forces folly thro' the grate Her panegyrick to repeat. This view, profusely when inclin'd, Enters a caveat in the mind: Experience join'd with common sense, To mortals is a providence. Passion, as frequently is seen, Subsiding settles into Spleen. Hence, as the plague of happy life, I run away from party-strife. A prince's cause, a church's claim, I've known to raise a mighty flame, And priest, as stoker, very free To throw in peace and charity. That tribe, whose practicals decree Small-beer the deadliest heresy; Who, fond of pedigree, derive From the most noted whore alive; Who own wine's old prophetick aid, And love the mitre Bacchus made, Forbid the faithful to depend On half-pint drinkers for a friend, And in whose gay red-letter'd face We read good-living more than grace: Nor they so pure, and so precise, Immac'late as their white of eyes, Who for the spirit hug the Spleen, Phylacter'd throughout all their mien, Who their ill-tasted home-brew'd pray'r To the state's mellow forms prefer; Who doctrines, as infectious, fear, Which are not steep'd in vinegar, And samples of heart-chested grace Expose in shew-glass of the face, Did never me as yet provoke, Either to honour band and cloak, Or deck my hat with leaves of oak. I rail not with mock-patriot grace At folks, because they are in place; Nor, hir'd to praise with stallion pen, Serve the ear-lechery of men; But to avoid religious jars The laws are my expositors, Which in my doubting mind create Conformity to church and state. I go, pursuant to my plan, To Mecca with the caravan, And think it right in common sense Both for diversion and defence. Reforming schemes are none of mine; To mend the world's a vast design: Like theirs, who tug in little boat, To pull to them the ship afloat, While to defeat their labour'd end, At once both wind and stream contend: Success herein is seldom seen, And zeal, when baffled, turns to Spleen. Happy the man, who, innocent, Grieves not at ills he can't prevent; His skiff does with the current glide, Not puffing pull'd against the tide. He, paddling by the scuffling crowd, Sees unconcern'd life's wager row'd, And when he can't prevent foul play, Enjoys the folly of the fray. By these reflections I repeal Each hasty promise made in zeal. When g?l P?s say, Were bound our great light to display, And Indian darkness drive away, Yet none but drunken watchmen send, And scoundrel link-boys for that end; When they cry up this holy war, Which ev'ry christian should be for, Yet such as owe the law their ears, We find employ'd as engineers: This view my forward zeal so shocks, In vain they hold the money-box. At such a conduct which intends By vicious means such virtuous ends, I laugh off Spleen, and keep my pence From spoiling Indian innocence. Yet philosophic love of ease I suffer not to prove disease, But rise up in the virtuous cause Of a free press, and equal laws. The press restrain'd! nefandous thought! In vain our sires have nobly fought: While free from force the press remains, Virtue and Freedom cheer our plains, And Learning largesses bestows, And keeps uncensur'd open house. We to the nation's publick mart Our works ot wit, and schemes of art And philosophic goods this way, Like water carriage cheap convey. This tree, which knowledge so affords, Inquisitors with flaming swords From lay-approach with zeal defend, Lest their own paradise should end. The press from her fecundous womb Brought forth the arts of Greece and Rome; Her offspring, skill'd in logic war, Truth's banner wav'd in open air; The monster Superstition fled, And hid in shades its Gorgon head; And lawless pow'r, the long-kept field, By reason quell'd, was forc'd to yield. This nurse of arts, and freedom's fence To chain, is treason against sense; And, Liberty, thy thousand tongues None silence, who design no wrongs; For those, that use the gag's restraint, First rob, before they stop complaint. Since disappointment galls within, And subjugates the soul to Spleen, Most schemes, as money-snares, I hate, And bite not at projector's bait. Sufficient wrecks appear each day, And yet fresh fools are cast away. Ere well the bubbled can turn round, Their painted vessel runs aground; Or in deep seas it oversets By a fierce hurricane of debts; Or helm-directors in one trip, Freight first embezzled, sink the ship. Such was of late a corporation, The brazen serpent of the nation, Which when hard accidents distress'd, The poor must look at to be blest, And thence expect, with paper seal'd By fraud and us'ry, to be heal'd. I in no soul-consumption wait Whole years at levees of the great, And hungry hopes regale the while On the spare diet of a smile. There you may see the idol stand With mirror in his wanton hand; Above, below, now here, now there He throws about the sunny glare: Crowds pant, and press to seize the prize, The gay delusion of their eyes. When Fancy tries her limning skill To draw and colour at her will, And raise and round the figures well, And shew her talent to excel, I guard my heart, lest it should woo Unreal beauties Fancy drew, And disappointed, feel despair At loss of things, that never were. When I lean politicians mark Grazing on æther in the park; Who e'er on wing with open throats Fly at debates, expresses, votes, Just in the manner swallows use, Catching their airy food of news; Whose latrant stomachs oft molest The deep-laid plans their dreams suggest; Or see some poet pensive sit, Fondly mistaking Spleen for Wit; Who, tho' short-winded, still will aim To sound the epick trumph of Fame; Who still on Phœbus' smiles will doat, Nor learn conviction from his coat; I bless my stars, I never knew Whimsies, which close pursu'd, undo, And have from old experience been Both parent and the child of Spleen. These subjects of Apollo's state, Who from false fire derive their fate, With airy purchases undone Of lands, which none lend money on, Born dull, had follow'd thriving ways, Nor lost one hour to gather bays. Their fancies first delirious grew, And scenes ideal took for true. Fine to the sight Parnassus lies, And with false prospects cheats their eyes; The fabled gods the poets sing, A season of perpetual spring, Brooks, flow'ry fields, and groves of trees, Affording sweets and similes, Gay dreams inspir'd in myrtle bow'rs, And wreaths of undecaying flow'rs, Apollo's harp with airs divine, The sacred musick of the Nine, Views of the temple rais'd to Fame, And for a vacant nitch proud aim, Ravish their souls, and plainly shew What Fancy's sketching power can do. They will attempt the mountain steep, Where on the top, like dreams in sleep, The Muses revelation shew, That find men crack'd, or make them so. You friend, like me, the trade of rhyme Avoid, elab'rate waste of time, Nor are content to be undone, To pass for Phœbus' crazy son. Poems, the hop-grounds of the brain, Afford the most uncertain gain; And lott'ries never tempt the wise With blanks so many to a prize. I only transient visits pay, Meeting the Muses in my way, Scarce known to the fastidious dames, Nor skill'd to call them by their names. Nor can their passports in these days, Your profit warrant, or your praise. On poems by their dictates writ, Criticks, as sworn appraisers, sit, And mere upholst'rers in a trice On gems and painting set a price. These tayl'ring artists for our lays Invent cramp'd rules, and with strait stays Striving free Nature's shape to hit, Emaciate sense, before they fit. A common place, and many friends, Can serve the plagiary's ends. Whose easy vamping talent lies, First wit to pilfer, then disguise. Thus some devoid of art and skill To search the mine on Pindus' hill, Proud to aspire and workmen grow, By genius doom'd to stay below, For their own digging shew the town Wit's treasure brought by others down. Some wanting, if they find a mine, An artist's judgment to refine, On fame precipitately fix'd, The ore with baser metals mix'd Melt down, impatient of delay, And call the vicious mass a play. All these engage to serve their ends, A band select of trusty friends, Who, lesson'd right, extol the thing, As Psapho taught his birds to sing; Then to the ladies they submit, Returning officers on wit; A crowded house their presence draws, And on the beaus imposes laws, A judgment in its favour ends, When all the pannel are its friends: Their natures merciful and mild Have from mere pity sav'd the child; In bulrush ark the bantling found Helpless and ready to be drown'd, They have preserv'd by kind support, And brought the baby-muse to court. But there's a youth that you can name, Who needs no leading strings to fame, Whose quick maturity of brain The birth of Pallas may explain: Dreaming of whose depending fate, I heard Melpomene debate, This, this is he, that was foretold Should emulate our Greeks of old. Inspir'd by me with sacred art, He sings, and rules the varied heart; If Jove's dread anger he rehearse, We hear the thunder in his verse; If he describes love turn'd to rage, The furies riot in his page. If he fair liberty and law By ruffian power expiring draw, The keener passions then engage Aright, and sanctify their rage; If he attempt disastrous love, We hear those plaints that wound the grove, Within the kinder passions glow, And tears distill'd from pity flow. From the bright vision I descend, And my deserted theme attend. Me never did ambition seize, Strange fever most inflam'd by ease! The active lunacy of pride, That courts jilt Fortune for a bride. This par'dise-tree, so fair and high, I view with no aspiring eye: Like aspine shake the restless leaves, And Sodom-fruit our pains deceives, Whence frequent falls give no surprize, But fits of Spleen, call'd growing wise. Greatness in glitt'ring forms display'd Affects weak eyes much us'd to shade, And by its falsly-envy'd scene Gives self-debasing fits of Spleen. We should be pleas'd that things are so, Who do for nothing see the show, And, middle-siz'd, can pass between Life's hubbub safe, because unseen, And 'midst the glare of greatness trace A watry sun-shine in the face, And pleasures fled to, to redress The sad fatigue of idleness. Contentment, parent of delight, So much a stranger to our sight, Say, goddess, in what happy place Mortals behold thy blooming face; Thy gracious auspices impart, And for thy temple chuse my heart. They, whom thou deignest to inspire, Thy science learn, to bound desire; By happy alchymy of mind They turn to pleasure all they find; They both disdain an outward mien The grave and solemn garb of Spleen, And meretricious arts of dress, To feign a joy, and hide distress; Unmov'd when the rude tempest blows; Without an opiate they repose; And cover'd by your shield, defy The whizzing shafts, that round them fly: Nor meddling with the gods' affairs, Concern themselves with distant cares; But place their bliss in mental rest, And feast upon the good possess'd. Forc'd by soft violence of pray'r, The blythsome goddess sooths my care, I feel the deity inspire, And thus she models my desire. Two hundred pounds half-yearly paid, Annuity securely made, A farm some twenty miles from town, Small, tight, salubrious, and my own; Two maids, that never saw the town, A serving-man not quite a clown, A boy to help to tread the mow, And drive, while t'other holds the plough; A chief of temper form'd to please, Fit to converse, and keep the keys; And better to preserve the peace, Commission'd by the name of niece: With understandings of a size To think their master very wise. May heav'n (it's all I wish for) send One genial room to treat a friend, Where decent cup-board, little plate, Display benevolence, not state. And may my humble dwelling stand Upon some chosen spot of land: A pond before full to the brim, Where cows may cool, and geese may swim, Behind, a green like velvet neat, Soft to the eye, and to the feet; Where od'rous plants in evening fair Breathe all around ambrosial air; From Eurus, foe to kitchen-ground, Fenc'd by a slope with bushes crown'd, Fit dwelling for the feather'd throng, Who pay their quit-rents with a song; With op'ning views of hill and dale, Which sense and fancy too regale, Where the half-cirque, which vision bounds, Like amphitheatre surrounds: And woods impervious to the breeze, Thick phalanx of embodied trees, From hills thro' plains in dusk array Extended far, repel the day. Here stillness, height, and solemn shade Invite, and contemplation aid: Here nymphs from hollow oaks relate The dark decrees and will of fate, And dreams beneath the spreading beech Inspire, and docile fancy teach, While soft as breezy breath of wind, Impulses rustle thro' the mind: Here Dryads, scorning Phœbus' ray, While Pan melodious pipes away, In measur'd motions frisk about, 'Till old Silenus puts them out. There see the clover, pea, and bean, Vie in variety of green; Fresh pastures speckled o'er with sheep, Brown fields their fallow sabbaths keep, Plump Ceres golden tresses wear, And poppy-top-knots deck her hair, And silver-streams through meadows stray, And Naiads on the margin play, And lesser nymphs on side of hills From play-thing urns pour down the rills. Thus shelter'd, free from care and strife, May I enjoy a calm thro' life; See faction, safe in low degree, As men at land see storms at sea, And laugh at miserable elves, Not kind, so much as to themselves, Curs'd with such souls of base alloy, As can possess, but not enjoy; Debar'd the pleasure to impart By av'rice, sphincter of the heart, Who wealth, hard earn'd by guilty cares, Bequeath untouch'd to thankless heirs. May I, with look ungloom'd by guile, And wearing Virtue's liv'ry-smile, Prone the distressed to relieve, And little trespasses forgive, With income not in Fortune's pow'r, And skill to make a busy hour, With trips to town life to amuse, To purchase books, and hear the news, To see old friends, brush off the clown, And quicken taste at coming down, Unhurt by sickness' blasting rage, And slowly mellowing in age, When Fate extends its gathering gripe, Fall off like fruit grown fully ripe, Quit a worn being without pain, Perhaps to blossom soon again. But now more serious see me grow, And what I think, my Memmius, know. Th'enthusiast's hopes, and raptures wild Have never yet my reason foil'd. His springy soul dilates like air, When free from weight of ambient care, And, hush'd in meditation deep, Slides into dreams, as when asleep; Then, fond of new discoveries grown, Proves a Columbus of her own, Disdains the narrow bounds of place, And thro' the wilds of endless space, Borne up on metaphysick wings, Chases light forms, and shadowy things, And in the vague excursion caught, Brings home some rare exotick thought. The melancholy man such dreams, As brightest evidence, esteems; Fain would he see some distant scene Suggested by his restless Spleen, And Fancy's telescope applies With tinctur'd glass to cheat his eyes. Such thoughts, as love the gloom of night, I close examine by the light; For who, tho' brib'd by gain to lie, Dare sun-beam-written truths deny, And execute plain common sense On faith's mere hearsay evidence? That superstition mayn't create, And club its ill with those of fate, I many a notion take to task, Made dreadful by its visor-mask. Thus scruple, spasm of the mind, Is cur'd, and certainty I find, Since optick reason shews me plain, I dreaded spectres of the brain, And legendary fears are gone, Tho' in tenacious childhood sown. Thus in opinions I commence Freeholder in the proper sense, And neither suit nor service do, Nor homage to pretenders shew, Who boast themselves by spurious roll Lords of the manor of the soul; Preferring sense, from chin that's bare, To nonsense thron'd in whisker'd hair. To thee, Creator uncreate, O Entium Ens! divinely great!— Hold, Muse, nor melting pinions try, Nor near the blazing glory fly, Nor straining break thy feeble bow, Unfeather'd arrows far to throw: Thro' fields unknown nor madly stray, Where no ideas mark the way. With tender eyes, and colours faint, And trembling hands forbear to paint. Who features veil'd by light can hit? Where can, what has no outline, sit? My soul, the vain attempt forego, Thyself, the fitter subject, know. He wisely shuns the bold extreme, Who soon lays by th'unequal theme, Nor runs, with wisdom's Sirens caught, On quicksands swall'wing shipwreck'd thought; But, conscious of his distance, gives Mute praise, and humble negatives. In one, no object of our sight, Immutable and infinite, Who can't be cruel, or unjust, Calm and resign'd, I fix my trust; To him my past and present state I owe, and must my future fate. A stranger into life I'm come, Dying may be our going home, Transported here by angry Fate, The convicts of a prior state. Hence I no anxious thoughts bestow On matters, I can never know; Thro' life's foul way, like vagrant pass'd, He'll grant a settlement at last, And with sweet ease the wearied crown, By leave to lay his being down. If doom'd to dance th'eternal round Of life no sooner lost but found, And dissolution soon to come, Like spunge, wipes out life's present sum, But can't our state of pow'r bereave An endless series to receive; Then, if hard dealt with here by fate, We ballance in another state, And consciousness must go along, And sign th'acquittance for the wrong. He for his creatures must decree More happiness than misery, Or be supposed to create, Curious to try, what 'tis to hate: And do an act, which rage infers, 'Cause lameness halts, or blindness errs. Thus, thus I steer my bark, and sail On even keel with gentle gale; At helm I make my reason sit, My crew of passions all submit. If dark and blust'ring prove some nights, Philosophy puts forth her lights; Experience holds the cautious glass, To shun the breakers, as I pass, And frequent throws the wary lead, To see what dangers may be hid: And once in seven years I'm seen At Bath or Tunbridge, to careen. Tho' pleas'd to see the dolphins play, I mind my compass and my way, With store sufficient for relief, And wisely still prepar'd to reef, Nor wanting the dispersive bowl Of cloudy weather in the soul, I make (may heav'n propitious send Such wind and weather to the end) Neither becalm'd, nor over-blown, Life's voyage to the world unknown. An EPIGRAM. On the Reverend Mr. Laurence Echard's, and Bishop Gilbert Burnet's Histories. By the Same. Gil's history appears to me Political anatomy, A case of skeletons well done, And malefactors every one. His sharp and strong incision pen Historically cuts up men, And does with lucid skill impart Their inward ails of head and heart. Laurence proceeds another way, And well-dress'd figures doth display: His characters are all in flesh, Their hands are fair, their faces fresh; And from his sweet'ning art derive A better scent than when alive. He wax-work made to please the sons, Whose fathers were Gil's skeletons. The SPARROW and DIAMOND. A SONG. By the Same. I I lately saw, what now I sing, Fair Lucia's hand display'd: This finger grac'd a diamond ring, On that a sparrow play'd. II The feather'd play-thing she caress'd, She stroak'd its head and wings; And while it nestled on her breast, She lisp'd the dearest things. III With chizzled bill a spark ill set He loosen'd from the rest, And swallow'd down to grind his meat, The easier to digest. IV She seiz'd his bill with wild affright, Her diamond to descry: 'Twas gone! she sicken'd at the sight, Moaning her bird would die. V The tongue-ty'd knocker none might use, The curtains none undraw, The footmen went without their shoes, The street was laid with straw. VI The doctor us'd his oily art Of strong emetick kind, The apothecary play'd his part, And engineer'd behind. VII When physic ceas'd to spend its store To bring away the stone, Dicky, like people given o'er, Picks up, when let alone. VIII His eyes dispell'd their sickly dews, He peck'd behind his wing; Lucia recovering at the news, Relapses for the ring. IX Mean-while within her beauteous breast Two different passions strove; When av'rice ended the contest, And triumph'd over love. X Poor little, pretty, fluttering thing, Thy pains the sex display, Who only to repair a ring Could take thy life away; XI Drive av'rice from your breasts, ye fair, Monster of foulest mien: Ye would not let it harbour there, Could but its form be seen. XII It made a virgin put on guile, Truth's image break her word, A Lucia's face forbear to smile, A Venus kill her bird. JOVE and SEMELE. By the Same. Occasioned by a Lady's saying, that none of the ancient poetical Stories reflected so much on the Vanity of Women, as that of Phaëton does on the Ambition of Men. Jove for amusement quitted oft his skies, To visit earth, contracted to our size; And lov'd (however things in heav'n might go) Exceedingly a game of romps below. Miss Semele he pick'd up, as he went, And thought, he pleas'd her to her heart's content. But minds aspiring ne'er can be at ease; Once known a god, as man he ceas'd to please. In tenderest time, which women know, 'tis said, Thus she bespake the loving god in bed. Thou, who gav'st Dædalus his mazy art, And knowest all things but a woman's heart, Hear my request, for something yet untry'd, And swear by Styx, I shall not be deny'd. Fond Jove, like men, the better to succeed, Took any oath; then bade the girl proceed. In human guise, great Jove, leave off to rove, Deceiving woman-kind, and pilf'ring love: What are those joys, which as a man you give, To what a god of thunder can atchieve? Such weight of love, and might of limbs employ, As give immortal madams heav'nly joy. Jove came array'd, as bound by cruel fate, And Semele enjoy'd the god in state: When flaming splendors round his beamy head Divinely shone, and struck the mortal dead. Faint from the course though we awhile retreat, To cool and breathe before another heat; The gods can't know, fresh with eternal prime, Love's stinted pause, nor want recruits from time; But must with unabating ardours kiss, And bear down nature with excess of bliss. Learn hence, each fair one, whom like beauties grace, Possess'd of lawless empire by your face, Not to do what you list, because you may, Let cool discretion warm desires allay; And itching curiosity believe, A lurking taint deriv'd from mother Eve. Spare then the men, ye fair, and frankly own, Your sex, like ours, has had its Phaëton. The SEEKER. By the Same. When I first came to London, I rambled about From sermon to sermon, took a slice and went out. Then on me, in divinity batchelor, try'd Many priests to obtrude a Levitical bride; And urging their various opinions, intended To make me wed systems, which they recommended. Said a letch'rous old fry'r skulking near Lincoln's-Inn, (Whose trade's to absolve, but whose pastimes's to sin; Who, spider-like, seizes weak protestant flies, Which hung in his sophistry cobweb he spies;) Ah pity your soul, for without our church pale, If you happen to die, to be damn'd you can't fail; The bible, you boast, is a wild revelation: Hear a church that can't err if you hope for salvation. Said a formal non-con, (whose rich stock of grace Lies forward expos'd in shop-window of face,) Ah! pity your soul: come, be of our sect: For then you are safe, and may plead you're elect. As it stands in the Acts, we can prove ourselves saints, Being Christ's little flock ev'ry where spoke against. Said a jolly church parson, (devoted to ease, While penal law dragons guard his golden fleece,) If you pity your soul, I pray listen to neither; The first is in error, the last a deceiver: That ours is the true church, the sense of our tribe is, And surely in medio tutissimus ibis. Said a yea and nay friend with a stiff hat and band, (Who while he talk'd gravely would hold forth his hand,) Dominion and wealth are the aim of all three, Tho' about ways and means they may all disagree; Then prithee be wise, go the quakers by-way, 'Tis plain, without turnpikes, so nothing to pay. On Barclay's Apology for the Quakers. By the Same. These sheets primæval doctrines yield, Where revelation is reveal'd: Soul-phlegm from literal feeding bred, Systems lethargick to the head They purge, and yield a diet thin, That turns to gospel-chyle within. Truth sublimate may here be seen Extracted from the parts terrene. In these is shewn, how men obtain What of Prometheus poets feign: To scripture-plainness dress is brought, And speech, apparel to the thought. They hiss from instinct at red coats, And war, whose work is cutting throats, Forbid, and press the law of love: Breathing the spirit of the dove. Lucrative doctrines they detest, As manufactur'd by the priest; And throw down turnpikes, where we pay For stuff, which never mends the way; And tythes, a Jewish tax, reduce, And frank the gospel for our use. They sable standing armies break; But the militia useful make: Since all unhir'd may preach and pray, Taught by these rules as well as they; Rules, which, when truths themselves reveal, Bid us to follow what we feel. The world can't hear the small still voice, Such is its bustle and its noise; Reason the proclamation reads, But not one riot passion heeds. Wealth, honour, power the graces are, Which here below our homage share: They, if one votary they find To mistress more divine inclin'd, In truth's pursuit to cause delay Throw golden apples in his way. Place me, O heav'n, in some retreat There let the serious death-watch beat, There let me self in silence shun, To feel thy will, which should be done. Then comes the Spirit to our hut, When fast the senses' doors are shut; For so divine and pure a guest The emptiest rooms are furnish'd best. O Contemplation! air serene From damps of sense, and fogs of spleen! Pure mount of thought! thrice holy ground, Where grace, when waited for, is found. Here 'tis the soul feels sudden youth, And meets exulting, virgin Truth; Here, like a breeze of gentlest kind, Impulses rustle thro' the mind; Here shines that light with glowing face, The fuse divine, that kindles grace; Which, if we trim our lamps, will last, Till darkness be by dying past, And then goes out at end of night, Extinguish'd by superior light. Ah me! the heats and colds of life, Pleasure's and pain's eternal strife, Breed stormy passions, which confin'd, Shake, like th'Æolian cave, the mind; And raise despair, my lamp can last, Plac'd where they drive the furious blast. False eloquence, big empty sound, Like showers, that rush upon the ground, Little beneath the surface goes, All streams along and muddy flows. This sinks, and swells the buried grain, And fructifies like southern rain. His art, well hid in mild discourse, Exerts persuasion's winning force, And nervates so the good design, That king Agrippa's case is mine. Well-natur'd, happy shade, forgive! Like you I think, but cannot live. Thy scheme requires the world's contempt, That, from dependence life exempt; And constitution fram'd so strong, This world's worst climate cannot wrong. Not such my lot, not Fortune's brat, I live by pulling off the hat; Compell'd by station every hour To bow to images of power; And, in life's busy scenes immers'd, See better things, and do the worst. Eloquent Want, whose reasons sway, And make ten thousand truths give way, While I your scheme with pleasure trace, Draws near, and stares me in the face. Consider well your state, she cries, Like others kneel, that you may rise; Hold doctrines, by no scruples vex'd, To which preferment is annex'd, Nor madly prove, where all depends, Idolatry upon your friends. See, how you like my rueful face, Such you must wear, if out of place. Crack'd is your brain to turn recluse Without one farthing out at use. They, who have lands, and safe bank-stock, With faith so founded on a rock, May give a rich invention ease, And construe scripture how they please. The honour'd prophet, that of old Us'd heav'n's high counsels to unfold, Did, more than courier angels, greet The crows, that brought him bread and meat. PRE-EXISTENCE: A POEM, In Imitation of MILTON. Has quoniam cœli nondum dignamur honore, Quas dedimus certè terras habitare sinamus. Now had th'archangel trumpet, rais'd sublime Above the walls of heav'n, begun to sound; All æther took the blast, and hell beneath Shook with celestial noise; th'almighty host Hot with pursuit, and reeking with the blood Of guilty cherubs smear'd in sulphurous dust, Pause at the known command of sounding gold. At first they close the wide Tartarian gates, Th'impenetrable folds on brazen hinge Roll creaking horrible; the din beneath O'ercomes the roar of flames, and deafens hell. Then through the solid gloom with nimble wing They cut their shining traces up to light; Return'd upon the edge of heavenly day, Where thinnest beams play round the vast obscure, And with eternal gleam drive back the night. They find the troops less stubborn, less involv'd In crime and ruin, barr'd the realms of peace, Yet uncondemn'd to baleful seats of woe, Doubtful and suppliant; all the plumes of light Moult from their shuddering wings, and sickly fear Shades every face with horror; conscious guilt Rolls in the livid eye-ball, and each breast Shakes with the dread of future doom unknown. 'Tis here the wide circumference of heaven Opens in two vast gates, that inward turn Voluminous, on jasper columns hung By geometry divine: they ever glow With living sculptures, that arise by turns T'imboss the shining leaves, by turns they set To give succeeding argument their place; In holy hieroglyphicks on they move, The gaze of journeying angels, as they pass Oft looking back, and held in deep surprize. Here stood the troops distinct; the cherub guard Unbarr'd the splendid gates, and in they roll Harmonious; for a vocal spirit sits Within each hinge, and, as they onward drive, In just divisions breaks the numerous jarr With symphony melodious, such as spheres Involv'd in tenfold wreaths are said to sound. Out flows a blaze of glory; for on high Tow'ring advanc'd the moving throne of God, Vast and majestick; on each radiant side The pointed rays slope glittering; at the foot Glides a full tide of day, that onward pours, In liquid torrents through the black abyss, Sparkling among reluctant shapes which thence Retire confus'd; as when Vesuvio shakes With inward torments, and disgorges flames, O'er the vast mountain's ridge the burning waves Drive their refulgent curls, and on they roll Sweeping the glowing plains down to the sea; Th'affrighted sea leaps back with hideous roar To give the fire its course; thus Chaos wild Hissing recoils to let in floods of light. Above the throne, th'ideas heavenly bright Of past, of present, and of coming time Fix'd their immov'd abode, and there present An endless landscape of created things To sight celestial, where angelick eyes Are lost in prospect; for the shiny range, Boundless and various in its bosom bears Millions of full-proportion'd worlds, beheld With stedfast eyes, till more arise to view, And farther inward scenes start up unknown. Myriads of seraphs in long series wait About the throne, and as it moves, proceed In numerous order, to celestial song. Above, the symphony of mellow flutes; And harps, by flying angels gently touch'd, Relieve the trumpet's rage, and fitly blend The solemn sounds in harmony divine; Such as might tune new worlds, and give the laws To globes on high, and the just figure guide Of planets forming all their airy dance. Below, the blazing wheels drive bounding o'er The starry pavement; stars and hills of light Double their glories where the chariot rolls With rattling sound; and th'empyræum vast Down to its stedfast axis, groans throughout Under the burning tracts, till now it rests Upon the gaping brink of heaven; and there With open pomp, fills the vast empty space. Silence ensues; a deep and aweful pause More terrible, all expectation held In horror: now wrath imminent amaz'd With dreadful precipice, to all it seems More formidable near; then from the throne A vocal thunder roll'd the sense of God, Majestically long, repugnant all To princes' customs here; their judgments flash On guilt, with words concise, and sudden blaze. Quite otherwise, the God's enlarged speech Set wide the fate of things; that all around Might take full prospects of their coming doom. Servants of God! and Virtues great in arms; We approve your faithful works, and you return Bless'd from the dire pursuit of rebel foes; Resolv'd, obdurate, they have try'd the force Of this right hand, and known Almighty pow'r; Transfix'd with lightning down they sunk, they fell Into the fiery gulph, and deep they plunge Below the burning waves, to hide their heads In shelter from my vengeance bellowing hence More fierce, and scorching with more dreadful fires. There let 'em find their doom, that durst defy Omnipotence, and slight his proferr'd grace; Rolling in flames, and ne'er to find a dawn Of heavenly day; instead, the mind imbibes Eternal gloom, and sing'd with constant flames, Can find no ease; while fierce their boiling rage Eats through th'impyreal mould, and glows within With endless pain; not one repentant thought Shall cool the breast, but proud in horrid crime, The soul anneals and hardens in the fire. But you commission'd by commands divine, Have wisely fill'd your trust, and clos'd 'em all Within the fervid lake, lest any roam Into the dark abyss to shun their doom, And in the womb immense of things unborn Should seek annihilation; you must rise Among the shining virtues more sublime; On lofty thrones preferr'd for lofty deeds. For you, ye guilty throng! that lately join'd In this sedition, since seduc'd from good, And caught in trains of guile, by spirits malign, Superior in their order; you accept, Trembling, my heavenly clemency and grace. When the long æra once has fill'd its orb, You shall emerge to light, and humbly here Again shall bow before his favouring throne, If your own virtue second my decree: But all must have their manes first below, So stands th'eternal fate, but smoother yours Than what lost angels feel; nor can our reign, Without just dooms, the peace of heav'n secure; For forms celestial new erect in glory Wou'd totter, dazzled with the heights of power, Did not the nerves of justice fix their sight. See, where below in Chaos wond'rous deep A speck of light dawns forth, and thence throughout The shades, in many a wreath, my forming power There swiftly turns the burning eddy round, Absorbing all crude matter near its brink; Which next, with subtle motions, takes the form I please to stamp, the seed of infant worlds All now in embryo, but ere long shall rise Variously scatter'd in this vast expanse, Involv'd in winding orbs, until the brims Of outward circles brush the heavenly gates. The middle point a globe of curling fire Shall hold, which round it sheds its genial heat; Where'er I kindle life the motion grows In all the endless orbs, from this machine; And infinite vicissitudes shall roll About the restless center; for I rear, In those meanders turn'd, a dusty ball, Deform'd all o'er with woods, whose shaggy tops Inclose eternal mists, and deadly damps Hover within their boughs, to choak the light; Impervious scenes of horror, 'till reform'd To fields, and grassy dales, and flow'ry meads, By your continual pains. The torrid zone Here fries with constant heat, the swarthy world; Parching the plains where hideous monsters glare, And dusty mountains, tumbled by the winds, Stretch their uncertain heaps; no less the frost At either end shall rage, and high shall raise Firm promontories; vast the ruins seem Of desart nature, and th'eternal piles Load all the dreary coast, and thick in ice, Arm either pole, that yearly peeps askance On coming light, but feels no gentle ray Unbind the frozen chain. Between these lie The changeful climes, alternately they burn, And chill again by turns; for both extremes Make their incursions here; and this my will Unchangeable ordains your doleful seat. Beneath mishapen Chaos, and the field Of fighting atoms, where hot, moist, and dry, Wage an eternal war with dismal roar; The dismal roar breaks smoothly on the ground, Sacred to horror, and eternal night: Here Silence sits, whose visionary shape In folds of wreathy mantling sinks obscure, And in dark fumes reclines his drowsy head; An urn he holds, from whence a lake proceeds, Wide, flowing gently, smooth, and Lethe nam'd: Hither compell'd, each soul must drink long draughts Of those forgetful streams, 'till forms within, And all the great ideas fade and die: For if vast thought should play about a mind Inclos'd in flesh, and dragging cumbrous life, Flutt'ring and beating in the mournful cage, It soon would break its grates and wing away: 'Tis therefore my decree, the soul return Naked from off this beach, and perfect blank, To visit the new world; and strait to feel Itself, in crude consistence closely shut, The dreadful monument of just revenge; Immur'd by heaven's own hand, and plac'd erect On fleeting matter all imprison'd round With walls of clay; th'ætherial mould shall bear The chain of members, deafen'd with an ear, Blinded by eyes, and manacled in hands. Here anger, vast ambition, and disdain, And all the haughty movements rise and fall, As storms of neighbouring atoms tear the soul; And hope, and love, and all the calmer turns Of easy hours, in their gay gilded shapes, With sudden run, skim o'er deluded minds, As matter leads the dance; but one desire, Unsatisfy'd, shall mar ten thousand joys. The rank of beings, that shall first advance, Drink deep of human life; and long shall stay On this great scene of cares. From all the rest, That longer for the destin'd body wait, Less penance I expect; and short abode In those pale dreary kingdoms will content: Each has his lamentable lot, and all, On different racks, abide the pains of life. The pensive spirit takes the lonely grove: Nightly he visits all the sylvan scenes, Where far remote, a melancholy moon Raising her head, serene and shorn of beams, Throws here and there the glimmerings thro' the trees, To make more aweful darkness. Starry lights, Hung up on high, shed round 'em as they burn A pale sad influence; and they gild the plains With doubtful rays, which strike within the shades A trembling lustre and uncertain light. The Sage shall haunt this solitary ground, And view the dismal landscape, limn'd within In horrid shades, mix'd with imperfect light. Here Judgmegt, blinded by delusive Sense, Contracted through the cranny of an eye, Shoots up faint languid beams, to that dark seat, Wherein the soul bereav'd of native fire, Sits intricate, in misty clouds obscur'd, Ev'n from itself conceal'd, and there presides O'er jarring images with reason's sway, Which by his ordering more confounds their form; And by decisions more embroils the fray: The more he strives t'appease, the more he feels The struggling surges of the darksome void Impetuous, and the thick revolving thoughts Encount'ring thoughts, image on image turn'd, A Chaos of wild science, where sometimes The clashing notions strike out casual light, Which soon must perish and be lost again In the thick darkness round it. Now, he tries With all his might to raise some weighty thought, Of me, of fate, or of th'eternal round, Which but recoils to crush the labouring mind. High are his reasonings, but the feeble clue Of fleeting images he draws in vain To wond'rous length; (for still the turning maze Eludes his art) its end flies far away, And leaves him tracing round the toilsome path, Returning oft on the same beaten thought. For much of good he talks, and life serene, Of happiness deny'd, the dismal waste Of wisdom's privilege, and th'obdurate breast, Stubborn in anguish; idle wisdom all, Weak sorcery to charm a real pain; Distasting crowds and business, thus he seeks Diversion in himself, but with deep thoughts He kindles doubt; and while he strives to blow The ashes off, revives the brand of care. Hence far remov'd, a diff'rent noisy race In cities full and frequent take their seat, Where honour's crush'd, and gratitude oppress'd With swelling hopes of gain, that raise within A tempest, and, driv'n onward by success, Can find no bounds. For creatures of a day Stretch their wide cares to ages; full increase Starves the penurious soul, while empty sound Fills the ambitious; that shall ever shrink, Pining with endless cares, whilst this shall swell To tympany enormous. Bright in arms Here shines the hero, out he fiercely leads A martial throng, his instruments of rage, To fill the world with death, and thin mankind. Ambition drives, and round the world he roams, Marking his way with blood; the dreadful noise Begets a fame; and all the breath he leaves Is spent in his false praise, and vainly bloats The tyrant's soul; while high his kingdoms rise In fleeting pomp, hov'ring o'er their gaudy wings Around the servile globe, that tamely bends Beneath his haughty reign; and all his slaves Under his yoke shall groan, and scarce shall groan Without a crime. Here torturing engines roar With human voice disguis'd; earth, water, fire, Are made (dire elements of cruelty!) Subservient to his lust, and power to kill; Yet shall the herd endure, nor dare to break United their imaginary chain; While their great monarch chills with equal fears, No less a slave than they. Each rumour shakes The haughty purple, dark and cloudy cares Involve the aweful throne, that stands erect, Balanc'd on the wild people's temper'd rage, And fortify'd with dangerous arts of power. But death shall shift those scenes of misery; Then doubtful titles kindle up new wars, And urge on ling'ring fate; the ensigns blaze About the camp, and drums and trumpets' sound Prepare a solemn way to griezly war; Javelins and bearded spears in ghastly ranks Erect their shining heads, and round the field A harvest's scene of formidable death; Then joins the horrid shock, whose bellowing burst Torments the shatter'd air, and drowns the groans Of men below that roll in certain death. These are the mortal sports, the tragick plays By man himself embroil'd; the dire debate Make the waste desart seem serene and mild, Where savage nature in one common lies, By homely cots possess'd; all squalid, wild, And despicably poor, they range the field, And feel their share of hunger, care, and pain, Cheated by flying prey; and now they tear Their panting flesh; and now with nails unclean They tug their shaggy beards; and deeply quaff Of human woe, even when they rudely sip The flowing stream, or chew the savory pulp Of nature's freshest viands; fragrant fruits Enjoy'd with trembling, and in danger sought. But where th'appointed limits of a law Fences the general safety of the world, No greater quiet reigns; for wanton man, In giddy frolick easily leaps o'er His own invented bounds; hence rapine, fraud, Revenge, and lust, and all the hideous train Of nameless ills, distort the meagre mind To endless shapes of woe. Here misers mourn Departed gold, and their defrauded heirs Dire perjuries complain; the blended loads Of punishment and crime deform the world, And give no rest to man; with pangs and throes He enters on the stage; prophetick tears And infant cries prelude his future woes; And all is one continu'd scene of grief, 'Till the sad sable curtain falls in death. But that last act shall in one moment close Of doubt and darkness; pain shall crack the strings Of life decayed; no less the soul convuls'd, Trembles in anxious cares, and shuddering stands, Afraid to leap into the opening gulph Of future fate, till all the banks of clay Fall from beneath his feet: in vain he grasps The shatter'd reeds that cheat his easy wish. Reason is now no more; that narrow lamp (Which with its sickly fires would shoot its beams To distances unknown, and stretch its rays Askance my paths, in deepest darkness veil'd) Is sunk into his socket; inly there It burns a dismal light; th'expiring flame Is choak'd in fumes, and parts in various doubt. Then the gay glories of the living world Shall cast their empty varnish, and retire Out of his feeble view; and rising shade Sit hov'ring o'er all nature's various face. Musick shall cease, and instruments of joy Shall fail that sullen hour; nor can the mind Attend their sounds, when fancies swim in death, Confus'd and crush'd with cares: for long shall seem The dreary road, and melancholy dark, That leads he knows not where. Here empty space Gapes horrible, and threatens to absorb All being: yonder sooty demons glare, And dolorous spectres grin; the shapeless rout Of wild imagination dance and play Before his eyes obscure; till all in death Shall vanish, and the prisoner, now enlarg'd, Regains the flaming borders of the sky. He ended. Peals of thunder rend the heavens, And Chaos, from the bottom turn'd, resounds The mighty clangor: All the heavenly host Approve the high decree, and loud they sing Eternal justice; while the guilty troops, Sad with their doom, but sad without despair, Fall fluttering down to Lethe's lake, and there For penance, and the destin'd body, wait. CHIRON to ACHILLES. A POEM. By Hildebrand Jacob, Esq; Res est severa voluptas. Old Chiron to his pupil thus began, When he beheld him rip'ning into man. “Accomplish'd youth! well worthy of my pains, “You now are free, and guide yourself the reins: “Yet hear, Achilles, hear, before we part, “A few short precepts from a faithful heart. “What tho' the gods a Nestor's age deny! “Let management a longer life supply, “And learn, at least, to live, before you die. “A little tract, well till'd, more profit yields “Than realms of wild, uncultivated fields. “'Tis not from length of years our pleasures flow, “Nor to the gods alone our bliss we owe. “Our happiness, and pain depend on us: “Man's his own good, or evil genius. “Great ills by art we lighten, or remove, “And art our meanest pleasures may improve: “Much to ourselves is due, tho' much to Jove. “Think not, young prince, your elevated state, “Birth, honours, or the empty name of great, “Can fix your joys; they're ill secur'd, unless “You know yourself to form your happiness, “Which in the shepherd's humble hut is found, “While palaces with discord still resound. “Fortune to industry is ever kind, “And, tho' by the blind vulgar painted blind, “Is still more equal than the crowd suppose, “Who judge of happiness by outward shows; “She smiles on all conditions, each may be “A man of pleasure in his own degree. “Yet few with art their happiness pursue, “Tho' all mankind have happiness in view, “And ev'ry sense seems made by nature's skill “For giving pleasure and avoiding ill. “Nature our common mother has been kind, “And for a race of joy her sons design'd, “Who long to reach the goal, yet lazy, lag behind, “Or wholly blind, or doubtful how t'advance, “They leave the work of industry to chance. “And of those few who with more active strife “Pursue this great, important end of life, “Some, too impatient, know not how to wait; “Or aim at things beyond their human state: “These last thro' too much delicacy fall, “And by refining rob themselves of all. “Shun then, Achilles, shun the faults of such, “Who still propose too little, or too much. “Stretch not your hopes too far, nor yet despair, “But above all, of indolence beware. “Attend to what you do, or life will seem “But a mere vision, or fantastick dream, “Pass'd in ideas of delight, at best: “While real pleasure's lost in doubtful rest. “In short, learn when, and how to bear; in vain “He pleasure seeks, who is afraid of pain; “Pleasure's a serious thing, and cheaply bought “By labour, patience, management, and thought. “But you, aspiring youth, by nature seem “Addicted to an opposite extreme; “Impetuous, and restless, soon inflam'd, “And, like a generous courser, hardly tam'd; “In all things violent: but, O! disdain, “Brave prince, to let usurping passion reign, “In one rash moment sacrificing more “Than years of sad repentance may restore. “As Thracian winds the Euxine sea molest, “So wrath, and envy, from an human breast “Drive Halcyon peace, and banish kindly rest. “And no security for joy is found, “But in a mind that's tractable and sound. “Suppress the first emotions of your ire, “And smother in its birth the kindling fire. “Ere anger yet possesses all your soul, “Ere yet your bosom heaves, and eyeballs roll, “Think on the useful precepts, I have taught, “And meet the rising heat with wholsome thought. “Or seek the sacred Muses with your lyre, “Who with sweet peace to lonely shades retire; “Gods, and the sons of gods, the heroes, sing, “While hills and valleys with their praises ring; “These learn to imitate, and those adore, “And sweetly to yourself, yourself restore; “Musick, and verse, and solitude controul “Impetuous fury, and compose the soul. “For this, I early taught you how to sing, “And form'd your fingers to the trembling string; “For 'tis not all sweet pleasure's path to show: “The art of consolation man should know: “Our joys are short, and broken; and in vain “To constant bliss would human race attain: “Be oft contented to be free from pain. “There is a deity ordain'd by fate, “To damp our joys immoderately great, “That none on earth from sorrow should be free, “But ev'n our blessings taste of misery. “If fortune gives, what rarely we obtain, “An equal share of pleasure, and of pain, “Our portion is o'er-paid, the rest you'll find “But fond ideas of the wanton mind; “Which now vain scenes of godlike pleasure shows, “And now creates imaginary woes. “When sad, your ills examine and compare, “Judge of your own by what another's are. “Consider greater wretches, and the fates “Of mighty heroes, and of mighty states: “Thus real evils in their proper light “Appear, the false thus vanish out of sight. “Nor aim at pleasures difficult to gain, “Choose rather what you may with ease obtain. “Who scorns to trifle, is by pride abus'd: “I pity him who ne'er can be amus'd; “But slighting pleasures moderate and small, “Must live in rapture, or not live at all. “Great pleasures still are near ally'd to pain: “Who quits the peaceful shore, and ploughs the main, “Big waves and mighty tempests must sustain. “Let not such fond ambition to be blest, “The humbler pleasures in your power molest; “Yet cherish hope; for without hope there's none: “Taste hope; but be not fed with that alone. “Some their whole lives in expectation spend, “As life were not begun, or ne'er would end: “Fondly from day to day themselves deceive, “Not living, but intending still to live; “While they neglect the joys they might possess, “For empty dreams of future happiness. “Let nature in your pleasures be your guide, “Nor suffer art her genuine charms to hide: “Her beauties with unwearied eyes we see; “The truth of beauty is simplicity. “Live not by imitation, servile state! “Nor on the fashion for your pleasures wait. “Man, otherwise so selfish, or so proud, “Submits his taste to the fantastick crowd, “And lives not for himself; do you pursue “Your own desires, and to yourself be true. “As bees extract their sweets from ev'ry flow'r, “So you your joys from all things in your pow'r, “With industry and management produce; “The meanest trifles are sometimes of use. “Yet know well what you do, and when 'tis done, “Nor at all hours to every pleasure run; “But mix with art your pleasures, and your toils; “For pleasures have their seasons, and their soils. “Thus when the earliest dawn of eastern light “Proclaims the finish'd empire of the night, “Haste to the field, Achilles, nor disdain “To chace the foaming monster o'er the plain, “Or teach the untam'd steed to feel the rein; “Or let your car and arms your nerves prepare, “Or for Olympick games or future war: “Then, whether arts or glory fire your mind, “Will thoughts more generous rise, or more refin'd; “Aurora to the Muses still is kind. “At noon, a simple short repast be made; “A shorter slumber in the cooling shade; “What's gay and light th'unbended mind employs, “Or sports, or past delights, or future joys. “But when the ev'ning-star begins to rise, “When Phœbus' fainting steeds forsake the skies, “Still cheerful at the well-spread board be found, “Amidst bright friends, and with fresh garlands crown'd, “While wine, and Thais with her voice and lyre, “Banish old sorrows, and new joys inspire. “Thus when from toils of empire you are free, “Nor camp, nor council claim your liberty, “The morn to labour and the Muses give; “At noon with temperance and quiet live; “Ceres' and Bacchus' gifts at ev'ning prove; “Divide the night with Somnus and with Love. “Thus, thus, Pelides, drive your cares away, “Nor fear the evil, till the evil day. “What tho' on Simois' or Scamander's shore, “Far off from home the Greeks your death deplore? “No matter where, or when; it once must be, “And nothing can revoke the firm decree. “Tho' Thetis' son, tho' third from mighty Jove, “Eternal monarch of the realms above, “Nor Jove, nor Thetis, can your days recal, “Or for an hour defer you destin'd fall. “Mean while a looser rein to pleasure give: “Time flies in haste, be you in haste to live: “Seize on the precious minutes, as they fleet; “Your life, however short, will be compleat, “If at the fatal moment you can say, “I've liv'd, and made the most of ev'ry day! “One precept more I fain would recommend, “And then old Chiron's tedious lessons end. “Learn, gen'rous prince, what's little understood, “The godlike happiness of doing good. “How glorious to defend, and to bestow! “From nobler springs can human pleasure flow? “A solid good which nothing can destroy, “The best prerogative the great enjoy. “For this, remember, monarchs first were made, “For this, young prince, be lov'd, and be obey'd, “At once your self, and mighty nations bless, “And make humanity your happiness. “But now Aurora ushers in the day, “And fond, expecting Peleus chides your stay. “Go then, brave youth, where'er the Fates may call; “Live with design, and fearless wait thy fall, “Whatever space of life the gods decree, “Thy name is still immortal; for I see “More than another Peleus rise in thee. “Thy fame the Homer. prince of sacred bards shall fire, “Thy deeds the By Alexander, who had Homer's Iliad always with him, proposing Achilles for his example. conquest of the world inspire. ????? ???????. Know your SELF. By the late Dr. Arbuthnot. What am I? how produc'd? and for what end? Whence drew I being? to what period tend? Am I th'abandon'd orphan of blind chance, Drop'd by wild atoms in disorder'd dance? Or from an endless chain of causes wrought, And of unthinking substance, born with thought? By motion which began without a cause, Supremely wise, without design or laws? Am I but what I seem, mere flesh and blood; A branching channel, with a mazy flood? The purple stream that through my vessels glides, Dull and unconscious flows, like common tides: The pipes through which the circling juices stray, Are not that thinking I, no more than they: This frame compacted with transcendent skill, Of moving joints obedient to my will, Nurs'd from the fruitful glebe, like yonder tree, Waxes and wastes; I call it mine, not me. New matter still the mould'ring mass sustains, The mansion chang'd, the tenant still remains; And from the fleeting stream, repair'd by food, Distinct, as is the swimmer from the flood. What am I then, sure, of a nobler birth. By parents right, I own as mother, earth; But claim superior lineage by my Sire, Who warm'd th'unthinking clod with heavenly fire: Essence divine, with lifeless clay allay'd, By double nature, double instinct sway'd; With look erect, I dart my longing eye, Seem wing'd to part, and gain my native sky; I strive to mount, but strive, alas! in vain, Ty'd to this massy globe with magick chain. Now with swift thought I range from pole to pole, View worlds around their flaming centers roll: What steady powers their endless motions guide, Thro' the same trackless paths of boundless void! I trace the blazing comet's fiery trail, And weigh the whirling planets in a scale: These godlike thoughts, while eager I pursue Some glittering trifle offer'd to my view, A gnat, an insect, of the meanest kind, Erase the new-born image from my mind; Some beastly want, craving, importunate, Vile as the grinning mastiff at my gate, Calls off from heav'nly truth this reas'ning me, And tells me, I'm a brute as much as he. If on sublimer wings of love and praise, My soul above the starry vault I raise, Lur'd by some vain conceit, or shameful lust, I flag, I drop, and flutter in the dust. The tow'ring lark thus from her lofty strain, Stoops to an emmet, or a barley grain. By adverse gusts of jarring instincts tost, I rove to one, now to the other coast; To bliss unknown my lofty soul aspires, My lot unequal to my vast desires. As 'mongst the hinds a child of royal birth Finds his high pedigree by conscious worth; So man, amongst his fellow brutes expos'd, See's he's a king, but 'tis a king depos'd. Pity him, beasts! you by no law confin'd, Are barr'd from devious paths by being blind; Whilst man, through op'ning views of various ways Confounded, by the aid of knowledge strays; Too weak to choose, yet choosing still in haste, One moment gives the pleasure and distaste; Bilk'd by past minutes, while the present cloy, The flatt'ring future still must give the joy: Not happy, but amus'd upon the road, And (like you) thoughtless of his last abode, Whether next sun his being shall restrain To endless nothing, happiness or pain. Around me, lo, the thinking thoughtless crew, (Bewilder'd each) their diff'rent paths pursue; Of them I ask the way; the first replies, Thou art a god; and sends me to the skies: Down on the turf the next, thou two-legg'd beast, There fix thy lot, thy bliss and endless rest: Between these wide extremes the length is such, I find I know too little or too much. “Almighty Power, by whose most wise command, “Helpless, forlorn, uncertain here I stand; “Take this faint glimmering of thyself away, “Or break into my soul with perfect day!” This said, expanded lay the sacred text, The balm, the light, the guide of souls perplex'd. Thus the benighted traveller that strays Through doubtful paths, enjoys the morning rays; The nightly mist, and thick descending dew, Parting, unfold the fields, and vaulted blue. “O Truth divine! enlighten'd by thy ray, “I grope and guess no more, but see my way; “Thou clear'dst the secret of my high descent, “And told me what those mystick tokens meant; “Marks of my birth, which I had worn in vain, “Too hard for worldly sages to explain. “Zeno's were vain, vain Epicurus' schemes, “Their systems false, delusive were their dreams: “Unskill'd my two-fold nature to divide, “One nurs'd my pleasure, and one nurs'd my pride: “Those jarring truths which human art beguile, “Thy sacred page thus bids me reconcile.” Offspring of God, no less thy pedigree, What thou once wert, art now, and still may be, Thy God alone can tell, alone decree; Faultless thou drop'dst from his unerring skill, With the bare power to sin, since free of will: Yet charge not with thy guilt his bounteous love, For who has power to walk, has power to rove: Who acts by force impell'd, can nought deserve; And wisdom short of infinite may swerve. Borne on thy new-imp'd wings, thou took'st thy flight, Left thy Creator, and the realms of light; Disdain'd his gentle precept to fulfil; And thought to grow a god by doing ill: Though by foul guilt thy heavenly form defac'd, In nature chang'd, from happy mansions chas'd, Thou still retain'st some sparks of heav'nly fire, Too faint to mount, yet restless to aspire; Angel enough to seek thy bliss again, And brute enough to make thy search in vain. The creatures now withdraw their kindly use, Some fly thee, some torment, and some seduce; Repast ill suited to such diff'rent guests, For what thy sense desires, thy soul distastes; Thy lust, thy curiosity, thy pride, Curb'd, or deferr'd, or balk'd, or gratify'd, Rage on, and make thee equally unbless'd, In what thou want'st, and what thou hast possess'd. In vain thou hop'st for bliss on this poor clod, Return and seek thy Father, and thy God: Yet think not to regain thy native sky, Borne on the wings of vain philosophy; Mysterious passage! hid from human eyes; Soaring you'll sink, and sinking you will rise: Let humble thoughts thy wary footsteps guide, Repair by meekness what you lost by pride. LONDON: A POEM, In Imitation of the Third SATIRE of JUVENAL. By Mr. Samuel Johnson. ? Quis ineptæ Tam patiens urbis, tam ferreus ut teneat se? Juv. Tho' grief and fondness in my breast rebel, When injur'd Thales bids the town farewel, Yet still my calmer thoughts his choice commend, I praise the hermit, but regret the friend; Who now resolves, from vice and London far, To breathe in distant fields a purer air, And, fix'd on Cambria's solitary shore, Give to St. David one true Briton more. For who wou'd leave, unbrib'd, Hibernia's land, Or change the rocks of Scotland for the Strand? There none are swept by sudden fate away, But all whom hunger spares, with age decay: Here malice, rapine, accident, conspire, And now a rabble rages, now a fire; Their ambush here relentless ruffians lay, And here the fell attorney prowls for prey; Here falling houses thunder on your head, And here a female atheist talks you dead. While Thales waits the wherry that contains Of dissipated wealth the small remains, On Thames's bank in silent thought we stood, Where Greenwich smiles upon the silver flood. Struck with the seat that gave Queen Elizabeth born at Greenwich.Eliza birth, We kneel, and kiss the consecrated earth; In pleasing dreams the blissful age renew, And call Britannia's glories back to view; Behold her cross triumphant on the main, The guard of commerce, and the dread of Spain. Ere masquerades debauch'd, excise oppress'd, Or English honour grew a standing jest. A transient calm the happy scenes bestow, And for a moment lull the sense of woe. At length awaking with contemptuous frown, Indignant Thales eyes the neighb'ring town. Since worth, he cries, in these degen'rate days Wants ev'n the cheap reward of empty praise; In those curs'd walls, devote to vice and gain, Since unrewarded science toils in vain; Since hope but sooths to double my distress, And ev'ry moment leaves my little less; While yet my steddy steps no staff sustains, And life still vig'rous revels in my veins; Grant me, kind heaven, to find some happier place, Where honesty and sense are no disgrace; Some pleasing bank where verdant osiers play, Some peaceful vale with nature's painting gay; Where once the harrass'd Briton found repose, And safe in poverty defy'd his foes; Some secret cell, ye pow'rs, indulgent give: Let ? live here, for ? has learn'd to live. Here let those reign, whom pensions can incite To vote a patriot black, a courtier white; Explain their country's dear-bought rights away, And plead for pirates in the face of day; With slavish tenets taint our poison'd youth, And lend a lye the confidence of truth. Let such raise palaces, and manors buy, Collect a tax, or farm a lottery, With warbling eunuchs fill a licens'd stage, And lull to servitude a thoughtless age. Heroes, proceed! what bounds your pride shall hold? What check restrain your thirst of pow'r and gold? Behold rebellious virtue quite o'erthrown, Behold our fame, our wealth, our lives your own. To such, a groaning nation's spoils are giv'n, When publick crimes inflame the wrath of heav'n: But what, my friend, what hope remains for me, Who start at theft, and blush at perjury? Who scarce forbear, tho' Britain's court he sing, To pluck a titled poet's borrow'd wing; A statesman's logick unconvinc'd can hear, And dare to slumber o'er the Gazetteer; Despise a fool in half his pension dress'd, And strive in vain to laugh at H?y's jest. Others with softer smiles, and subtler art, Can sap the principles, or taint the heart; With more address a lover's note convey, Or bribe a virgin's innocence away. Well may they rise, while I, whose rustick tongue Ne'er knew to puzzle right, or varnish wrong, Spurn'd as a beggar, dreaded as a spy, Live unregarded, unlamented die, For what but social guilt the friend endears? Who shares Orgilio's crimes, his fortune shares: But thou, should tempting villainy present, All Marlb'rough hoarded, or all Villiers spent, Turn from the glitt'ring bribe thy scornful eye, Nor sell for gold, what gold could never buy, The peaceful slumber, self-approving day, Unsullied fame, and conscience ever gay. The cheated nation's happy fav'rites see; Mark whom the great caress, who frown on me. London! the needy villain's gen'ral home, The common sewer of Paris and of Rome, With eager thirst, by folly or by fate, Sucks in the dregs of each corrupted state. Forgive my transports on a theme like this, I cannot bear a French metropolis. Illustrious Edward! from the realms of day, The land of heroes and of saints survey; Nor hope the British lineaments to trace, The rustick grandeur, or the surly grace, But lost in thoughtless ease, and empty show, Behold the warrior dwindled to a beau; Sense, freedom, piety, refin'd away, Of France the mimick, and of Spain the prey. All that at home no more can beg or steal, Or like a gibbet better than a wheel; Hiss'd from the stage, or hooted from the court, Their air, their dress, their politicks import; Obsequious, artful, voluble and gay, On Britain's fond credulity they prey. No gainful trade their industry can 'scape, They sing, they dance, clean shoes, or cure a clap; All sciences a fasting Monsieur knows, And bid him go to hell, to hell he goes. Ah! what avails it, that, from slav'ry far, I drew the breath of life in English air; Was early taught a Briton's right to prize, And lisp the tales of Henry's victories; If the gull'd conqueror receives the chain, And flattery subdues when arms are vain? Studious to please, and ready to submit, The supple Gaul was born a parasite: Still to his int'rest true, where-e'er he goes, Wit, bravery, worth, his lavish tongue bestows; In ev'ry face a thousand graces shine, From ev'ry tongue flows harmony divine. These arts in vain our rugged natives try, Strain out with fault'ring diffidence a lye, And gain a kick for aukward flattery. Besides, with justice this discerning age Admires their wond'rous talents for the stage: Well may they venture on the mimick's art, Who play from morn to night a borrow'd part; Practis'd their master's notions to embrace, Repeat his maxims, and reflect his face; With ev'ry wild absurdity comply, And view each object with another's eye; To shake with laughter ere the jest they hear, To pour at will the counterfeited tear, And as their patron hints the cold or heat, To shake in dog-days, in December sweat. How, when competitors like these contend, Can surly virtue hope to fix a friend? Slaves that with serious impudence beguile, And lye without a blush, without a smile; Exalt each trifle, ev'ry vice adore, Your taste in snuff, your judgment in a whore; Can Balbo's eloquence applaud, and swear He gropes his breeches with a monarch's air. For arts like these prefer'd, admir'd, caress'd, They first invade your table, then your breast; Explore your secrets with insidious art, Watch the weak hour, and ransack all the heart; Then soon your ill-plac'd confidence repay, Commence your lords, and govern or betray. By numbers here from shame or censure free, All crimes are safe, but hated poverty. This, only this, the rigid law pursues, This, only this, provokes the snarling Muse. The sober trader at a tatter'd cloak, Wakes from his dream, and labours for a joke; With brisker air the silken courtiers gaze, And turn the varied taunt a thousand ways. Of all the grief that harrass the distress'd; Sure the most bitter is a scornful jest; Fate never wounds more deep the gen'rous heart, Than when a blockhead's insult points the dart. Has heaven reserv'd, in pity to the poor, No pathless waste or undiscover'd shore? No secret island in the boundless main? No peaceful desart yet unclaim'd by Spain? Quick let us rise, the happy seats explore, And bear oppression's insolence no more. This mournful truth is ev'ry where confess'd, Slow rises worth, by poverty depress'd: But here more slow, where all are slaves to gold, Where looks are merchandise, and smiles are sold; Where won by bribes, by flatteries implor'd, The groom retails the favours of his lord. But hark! th'affrighted crowd's tumultuous cries Roll through the streets and thunder to the skies: Rais'd from some pleasing dream of wealth and power, Some pompous palace or some blissful bow'r, Aghast you start, and scarce with aking sight Sustain th'approaching fire's tremendous light; Swift from pursuing horrors take your way, And leave your little all to flames a prey; Then thro' the world a wretched vagrant roam, For where can starving merit find a home? In vain your mournful narrative disclose, While all neglect, and most insult your woes. Should heaven's just bolts Orgilio's wealth confound, And spread his flaming palace on the ground, Swift o'er the land the dismal rumour flies, And publick mournings pacify the skies; The laureat tribe in servile verse relate, How virtue wars with persecuting fate; With well-feign'd gratitude the pension'd band Refund the plunder of the beggar'd land. See! while he builds, the gaudy vassals come, And crowd with sudden wealth the rising dome; The price of boroughs and of souls restore; And raise his treasures higher than before. Now bless'd with all the baubles of the great, The polish'd marble, and the shining plate, Orgilio sees the golden pile aspire, And hopes from angry heav'n another fire. Could'st thou resign the park and play content, For the fair banks of Severn or of Trent; There might'st thou find some elegant retreat, Some hireling senator's deserted seat; And stretch thy prospects o'er the smiling land, For less than rent the dungeons of the Strand; There prune thy walks, support thy drooping flow'rs, Direct thy rivulets, and twine thy bow'rs; And, while thy beds a cheap repast afford, Despise the dainties of a venal lord. There ev'ry bush with nature's musick rings, There ev'ry breeze bears health upon its wings; On all thy hours security shall smile, And bless thy evening walk and morning toil. Prepare for death, if here at night you roam, And sign your will before you sup from home. Some fiery fop, with new commission vain, Who sleeps on brambles till he kills his man; Some frolick drunkard, reeling from a feast, Provokes a broil, and stabs you for a jest Yet ev'n these heroes, mischievously gay, Lords of the street, and terrors of the way; Flush'd as they are with folly, youth and wine, Their prudent insults to the poor confine; Afar they mark the flambeau's bright approach, And shun the shining train, and golden coach. In vain these dangers past, your doors you close, And hope the balmy blessings of repose: Cruel with guilt and daring with despair, The midnight murd'rer bursts the faithless bar; Invades the sacred hour of silent rest, And plants, unseen, a dagger in your breast. Scarce can our fields, such crowds at Tyburn die, With hemp the gallows and the fleet supply. Propose your schemes, ye senatorian band, Whose ways and means support the sinking land; Lest ropes be wanting in the tempting spring, To rig another convoy for the k?g. A single jail, in Alfred's golden reign, Could half the nation's criminals contain; Fair Justice then, without constraint ador'd, Held high the steady scale, but deep'd the sword; No spies were paid, no special juries known, Blest age! but ah! how diff'rent from our own! Much could I add, but see the boat at hand, The tide retiring calls me from the land: Farewel!—When youth, and health, and fortune spent, Thou fly'st for refuge to the wilds of Kent; And tir'd like me with follies and with crimes, In angry numbers warn'st succeeding times; Then shall thy friend, nor thou refuse his aid, Still foe to vice, forsake his Cambrian shade; In virtue's cause once more exert his rage, Thy satire point, and animate thy page. PROLOGUE SPOKEN BY Mr. GARRICK, At the Opening of the Theatre in Drury-lane 1747. By the Same. When learning's triumph o'er her barb'rous foes First rear'd the stage, immortal Shakespear rose; Each change of many-colour'd life he drew, Exhausted worlds, and then imagin'd new: Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign, And panting Time toil'd after him in vain: His pow'rful strokes presiding Truth impress'd, And unresisted passion storm'd the breast. Then Johnson came, instructed from the school, To please in method, and invent by rule; His studious patience, and laborious art, By regular approach assail'd the heart; Cold approbation gave the ling'ring bays, For those who durst not censure, scarce cou'd praise. A mortal born, he met the general doom, But left, like Egypt's kings, a lasting tomb. The wits of Charles found easier ways to fame, Nor wish'd for Johnson's art, or Shakespear's flame; Themselves they studied, as they felt they writ; Intrigue was plot, obscenity was wit. Vice always found a sympathetick friend, They pleas'd their age, and did not aim to mend. Yet bards like these aspir'd to lasting praise, And proudly hop'd to pimp in future days. Their cause was gen'ral, their supports were strong, Their slaves were willing, and their reign was long; Till shame regain'd the post that sense betray'd, And Virtue call'd oblivion to her aid. Then crush'd by rules, and weaken'd as refin'd, For years the pow'r of tragedy declin'd; From bard to bard the frigid caution crept, Till declamation roar'd, while passion slept. Yet still did Virtue deign the stage to tread, Philosophy remain'd, though Nature fled. But forc'd at length her ancient reign to quit, She saw great Faustus lay the ghost of Wit: Exulting Folly hail'd the joyful day, And pantomime and song confirm'd her sway. But who the coming changes can presage, And mark the future periods of the stage? Perhaps if skill could distant times explore, New Behns, new Durfeys, yet remain in store. Perhaps, where Lear has rav'd, and Hamlet dy'd, On flying cars new sorcerers may ride. Perhaps (for who can guess th'effects of chance?) Here Hunt may box, or Mahomet may dance. Hard is his lot, that here by Fortune plac'd, Must watch the wild vicissitudes of taste; With every meteor of caprice must play, And chace the new-blown bubbles of the day. Ah! let not censure term our fate our choice; The stage but echoes back the publick voice, The drama's laws the drama's patrons give, For we that live to please, must please, to live. Then prompt no more the follies you decry, As tyrants doom their tools of guilt to die; 'Tis yours this night to bid the reign commence Of rescu'd nature, and reviving sense; To chace the charms of sound, the pomp of show, For useful mirth, and salutary woe; Bid scenic virtue form the rising age, And truth diffuse her radiance from the stage. Of Active and Retired Life. AN EPISTLE to H. C. Esq; By William Melmoth, Esq; First printed in the Year MDCCXXXV. Meo quidem judicio neuter culpandus, alter dum expetit debitos titulos, dum alter mavult videri contempsisse. Plin. Ep. Yes, you condemn those sages too refin'd, That gravely lecture ere they know mankind; Who whilst ambition's fiercer fires they blame, Would damp each useful spark that kindles fame. 'Tis in false estimates the folly lies; The passion's blameless, when the judgment's wise. In vain philosophers with warmth contest, Life's secret shade, or open walk is best: Each has its separate joys, and each its use: This calls the patriot forth, and that the muse. Hence not alike to all the species, heav'n An equal thirst of publick fame has given: Patrius it forms to shine in action great; While Decio's talents best adorn retreat. If where Pierian maids delight to dwell, The haunts of silence, and the peaceful cell, Had, fair Astræa! been thy Talbot's choice, Could list'ning crowds now hang upon his voice? And thou, blest maid, might'st long have wept in vain The distant glories of a second reign, In exile doom'd yet ages to complain. Were high ambition still the power confess'd That rul'd with equal sway in every breast, Say where the glories of the sacred nine? Where Homer's verse sublime, or, Milton, thine? Nor thou, sweet bard! who “turn'd the tuneful art, “From sound to sense, from fancy to the heart.” Thy lays instructive to the world hadst giv'n, Nor greatly justified the laws of heav'n. Let satire blast with ev'ry mark of hate, The vain aspirer, or dishonest great, Whom love of wealth, or wild ambition's sway Push forward, still regardless of the way; High and more high who aim with restless pride, Where neither reason, nor fair virtue guide: And him, the wretch, who labors on with pain, For the low lucre of an useless gain, (Wise but to get, and active but to save) May scorn deserv'd still follow to the grave. But he who fond to raise a splendid name, On life's ambitious height would fix his fame, In active arts, or vent'rous arms would shine, Yet shuns the paths which virtue bids decline; Who dignifies his wealth by gen'rous use, To raise th'oppress'd, or merit to produce— Shall reason's voice impartial e'er condemn The glorious purpose of so wise an aim? Where virtue regulates this just desire, 'Twere dang'rous folly to suppress its fire. Say, whence could fame supply, (its force unknown) Her roll illustrious of fair renown? What laurels prompt the hero's useful rage? What prize the patriot's weighty toils engage? Each publick passion bound to endless frost, Each deed of social worth for ever lost. O! may the Muse inspire the love of praise, Raise the bright passion, but with judgment raise! For this she oft has tun'd her sacred voice, Call'd forth the patriot, and approv'd his choice; Bid him the steep ascent to honor take, Nor till the summit gain'd, her paths forsake. Yet not success alone true fame attends; He too shall reach it who but well intends. See 'midst the vanquish'd virtuous, He was killed in the civil wars: see his character at large in Clarendon's history. Falkland lies; His gen'rous efforts vain, and vain his sighs; Yet true to merit faithful records tell, To distant ages how the patriot fell: Blest youth! insur'd the sweetest voice of praise, Who lives approv'd in Pope's unrival'd lays. Grave precepts fleeting notions may impart, But bright example best instructs the heart: Then look on Patrius, let his conduct shew From active life what various blessings flow. In him a just ambition stands confess'd; It warms, but not inflames, his equal breast. See him in senates act the patriot's part, Truth on his lips, the publick at his heart; There neither fears can awe, nor hopes controul, The honest purpose of his steady soul. No mean attachments e'er seduced his tongue To gild the cause his heart suspected wrong; But deaf to envy, faction, spleen, his voice Joins here or there, as reason guides his choice. To one great point his faithful labors tend, And all his toils in Britain's interest end. To him each neighbour safe refers his claim, The right he settles, and abates the flame. Nor arts nor worth to Patrius sue in vain, Nor unreliev'd the injur'd e'er complain. For him the hand unseen, are pray'rs prefer'd, And grateful vows in distant temples heard; Like nature's blessings to no part confin'd, His well-pois'd bounty reaches all mankind, That insolence of wealth, the pomp of state Which crowds the mansions of the vainly great, Flies far the limits of his modest gate. Just what is elegantly useful's there; Of aught beyond he scorns th'unworthy care; Nor wou'd, for all the trim that pride can show, One single act of social aid forego; For this he labors to improve his store, For this he wishes to enlarge his pow'r; This is his life's great purpose, end, and aim: Such true ambition is, and worthy fame. How different Rapax spent his worthless hour! With treasure indigent, a slave with pow'r: Large sums o'erlooking, still intent on more, He wasted, not enjoy'd, his tasteless store. His growing greatness rais'd his hopes the high'r, And fan'd his restless pride's increasing fire, 'Twas thus amidst prosperity he pin'd; For what can fill the false-ambitious mind? With all the honors that his prince cou'd give, With all the wealth his av'rice cou'd receive, 'Midst outward opulence, but inward care, Reproach and want was all he left his heir. 'Tis true, the patriot well deserves his fame, And from his country just applause may claim. But what avails it to the world beside, That Brutus bravely stab'd, or Curtius dy'd? While Tully's merit, unconfin'd to place, Diffuses blessings down thro' all our race; Remotest times his learned labors reach, And Rome's great moralist e'en now shall teach. Averse to publick noise, ambition's strife, And all the splendid ills of busy life, Thro' latent paths, unmark'd by vulgar eye, Are there who wish to pass unheeded by? Whom calm retirement's sacred pleasures move, The hour contemplative, or friend they love; Yet not by spleen, or superstition led, Forbear ambition's giddy heights to tread; Who not inglorious spend their peaceful day, Whilst science, lovely star! directs their way? Flows there not something good from such as these? No useful product from the men of ease? And shall the Muse no social merit boast? Are all her vigils to the publick lost? Tho' noisy pride may scorn her silent toil, Fair are the fruits which bless her happy soil: There every plant of useful produce grows, There science sprang, and thence instruction flows; There true philosophy erects her school, There plans her problem, and there forms her rule; There every seed of every art began, And all that eases life, and brightens man. 'Twas hence great Newton, mighty genius! soar'd, And all creation's wond'rous range explor'd. Far as th'Almighty stretch'd his utmost line, He pierc'd in thought, and view'd the vast design. Too long had darker ages sought in vain The secret scheme of nature to explain; Too long had truth escap'd each sage's eye, Or faintly shone thro' vain philosophy. Each shapely offspring of her feeble thought, A darker veil o'er genuine science brought; Still stubborn facts o'erthrew their fruitless toil; For truth and fiction who shall reconcile? But Britain's sons a surer guide pursue; Tread safe the maze, since Newton gave the clue. Where-e'er he turn'd true Science rear'd her head, While far before her puzzled Ign'rance fled: From each blest truth these noble ends he draws, Use to mankind, and to their God applause. Taught by his rules secure the merchant rides, When threat'ning seas roll high their dreadful tides; And either India speeds her precious stores, 'Midst various dangers safe to Britain's shores. Long as those orbs he weigh'd shall shed their rays, His truth shall guide us, and shall last his praise. Yet if so just the same, the use so great, Systems to poise, and spheres to regulate; To teach the secret well-adapted force, That steers of countless orbs th'unvaried course; Far brighter honors wait the nobler part, To balance manners, and conduct the heart. Order without us, what imports it seen, If all is restless anarchy within? Fir'd by this thought great Ashley, gen'rous sage, Plan'd in sweet leisure his See the Characteristicks, particularly the enquiry concerning Virtue and the Moralists. instructive page. Not orbs he weighs, but marks, with happier skill, The scope of actions and the poise of will: In fair proportion here describ'd we trace Each mental beauty, and each moral grace; Each useful passion taught, its tone design'd In the nice concord of a well-tun'd mind. Does mean self-love contract each social aim? Here publick transports shall thy soul inflame. Virtue and Deity supremely fair, Too oft delineated with looks severe, Resume their native smiles and graces here: Sooth'd into love relenting foes admire, And warmer raptures every friend inspire. Such are the fruits which from retirement spring; These blessings ease and learned leisure bring. Yet of the various tasks mankind employ, 'Tis sure the hardest, leisure to enjoy. For one who knows to taste this godlike bliss, What countless swarms of vain pretenders miss? Tho' each dull plodding thing, to ape the wise, Ridiculously grave, for leisure sighs, (His boasted wish from busy scenes to run) Grant him that leisure, and the fool's undone. The gods, to curse poor Demea, heard his vow, And business now no more contracts his brow: Nor real cares, 'tis true, perplex his breast, But thousand fancied ills his peace molest: The slightest trifles solid sorrows prove, And the long ling'ring wheel of life scarce seems to move. Useless in business, yet unfit for ease, Nor skill'd to mend mankind, nor form'd to please, Such spurious animals of worthless race Live but the publick burthen and disgrace: Like mean attendants on life's stage are seen, Drawn forth to fill, but not conduct the scene. The mind not taught to think, no useful store To fix reflection, dreads the vacant hour. Turn'd on its self its num'rous wants are seen, And all the mighty void that lies within Yet cannot wisdom stamp our joys complete; 'Tis conscious virtue crowns the blest retreat. Who feels not that, the private path must shun, And fly to publick view t'escape his own; In life's gay scenes uneasy thoughts suppress, And lull each anxious care in dreams of peace. 'Midst foreign objects not employ'd to roam, Thought, sadly active, still corrodes at home: A serious moment breaks the false repose, And guilt in all its naked horror shows. He who would know retirement's joy refin'd The fair recess must seek with cheerful mind: No Cynick's pride, no bigot's heated brain, No frustrate hope, nor love's fantastick pain, With him must enter the sequester'd cell, Who means with pleasing solitude to dwell; But equal passions let his bosom rule, A judgment candid, and a temper cool, Enlarg'd with knowledge, and in conscience clear, Above life's empty hopes, and death's vain fear. Such he must be who greatly lives alone; Such Portio is, in crowded scenes unknown. For publick life with every talent born, Portio far off retires with decent scorn; Tho' without business never unemploy'd, And life, as more at leisure, more enjoy'd: For who like him can various science taste, His mind shall never want an endless feast, In his blest ev'ning walk may'st thou, may I, Oft friendly join in sweet society; Our lives like his in one smooth current flow, Nor swell'd with tempest, nor too calmly slow, Whilst he like some great sage of Rome or Greece, Shall calm each rising doubt and speak us peace, Correct each thought, each wayward wish controul, And stamp with every virtue all the soul. Ah! how unlike is Umbrio's gloomy scene, Estrang'd from all the cheerful ways of men! There superstition works her baneful pow'r, And darkens all the melancholy hour. Unnumber'd fears corrode and haunt his breast, With all that whim or ign'rance can suggest. In vain for him kind nature pours her sweets; The visionary saint no joy admits, But seeks with pious spleen fantastick woes, And for heav'n's sake heav'n's offer'd good foregoes. Whate'er's our choice we still with pride prefer, And all who deviate, vainly think must err: Clodio in books and abstract notions lost, Sees none but knaves and fools in honor's post; Whilst Syphax, fond on fortune's sea to sail, And boldly drive before the flatt'ring gale, (Forward her dang'rous ocean to explore,) Condemns as cowards those who make the shore. Not so my friend impartial,—man he views Useful in what he shuns as what pursues; Sees different turns to gen'ral good conspire, The hero's passion and the poet's fire; Each figure plac'd in nature's wise design, With true proportion and exactest line: Sees lights and shades unite in due degree, And form the whole with fairest symmetry. GRONGAR HILL. By Mr. Dyer. Silent nymph, with curious eye! Who, the purple ev'ning lie, On the mountain's lonely van, Beyond the noise of busy man, Painting fair the form of things, While the yellow linet sings; Or the tuneful nightingale Charms the forest with her tale; Come with all thy various hues, Come, and aid thy sister Muse; Now while Phœbus riding high Gives lustre to the land and sky! Grongar Hill invites my song, Draw the landskip bright and strong; Grongar, in whose mossy cells Sweetly musing Quiet dwells; Grongar, in whose silent shade, For the modest Muses made, So oft I have, the evening still, At the fountain of a rill, Sate upon a flow'ry bed, With my hand beneath my head; While stray'd my eyes o'er Towy's flood, Over mead, and over wood, From house to house, from hill to hill, 'Till Contemplation had her fill. About his chequer'd sides I wind, And leave his brooks and meads behind, And groves and grottoes where I lay, And vistoes shooting beams of day: Wide and wider spreads the vale; As circles on a smooth canal; The mountains round, unhappy fate! Sooner or later, all of height, Withdraw their summits from the skies, And lessen as the others rise; Still the prospect wider spreads, Adds a thousand woods and meads, Still it widens, widens still, And sinks the newly-risen hill. Now, I gain the mountain's brow, What a landskip lies below! No clouds, no vapours intervene, But the gay, the open scene Does the face of nature show, In all the hues of heaven's bow! And, swelling to embrace the light, Spreads around beneath the sight. Old castles on the cliffs arise, Proudly tow'ring in the skies! Rushing from the woods, the spires Seem from hence ascending fires! Half his beams Apollo sheds On the yellow mountain-heads! Gilds the fleeces of the flocks: And glitters on the broken rocks! Below me trees unnumber'd rise, Beautiful in various dyes: The gloomy pine, the poplar blue, The yellow beech, the sable yew, The slender fir, that taper grows, The sturdy oak with broad-spread boughs. And beyond the purple grove, Haunt of Phillis, queen of love! Gaudy as the op'ning dawn, Lies a long and level lawn, On which a dark hill, steep and high, Holds and charms the wand'ring eye! Deep are his feet in Towy's flood, His sides are cloath'd with waving wood, And ancient towers crown his brow, That cast an aweful look below; Whose ragged walls the ivy creeps, And with her arms from falling keeps; So both a safety from the wind On mutual dependence find. 'Tis now the raven's bleak abode; 'Tis now th'apartment of the toad; And there the fox securely feeds; And there the pois'nous adder breeds, Conceal'd in ruins, moss and weeds; While, ever and anon, there falls Huge heaps of hoary moulder'd walls. Yet time has seen, that lifts the low, And level lays the lofty brow, Has seen this broken pile compleat, Big with the vanity of state; But transient is the smile of fate! A little rule, a little sway, A sun beam in a winter's day, Is all the proud and mighty have Between the cradle and the grave. And see the rivers how they run, Thro' woods and meads, in shade and sun, Sometimes swift, sometimes slow, Wave succeeding wave, they go A various journey to the deep, Like human life to endless sleep! Thus is nature's vesture wrought, To instruct our wand'ring thought; Thus she dresses green and gay, To disperse our cares away. Ever charming, ever new, When will the landskip tire the view! The fountain's fall, the river's flow, The woody vallies, warm and low; The windy summit, wild and high, Roughly rushing on the sky! The pleasant seat, the ruin'd tow'r, The naked rock, the shady bow'r; The town and village, dome and farm, Each give each a double charm, As pearls upon an Æthiop's arm. See on the mountain's southern side, Where the prospect opens wide, Where the evening gilds the tide; How close and small the hedges lie! What streaks of meadows cross the eye! A step methinks may pass the stream, So little distant dangers seem; So we mistake the future's face, Ey'd thro' hope's deluding glass; As yon summits soft and fair, Clad in colours of the air, Which to those who journey near, Barren, brown, and rough appear; Still we tread the same coarse way, The present's still a cloudy day. O may I with myself agree, And never covet what I see: Content me with an humble shade, My passions tam'd, my wishes laid; For while our wishes wildly roll, We banish quiet from the soul: 'Tis thus the busy beat the air; And misers gather wealth and care. Now, ev'n now, my joys run high, As on the mountain-turf I lie; While the wanton Zephyr sings, And in the vale perfumes his wings; While the waters murmur deep; While the shepherd charms his sheep; While the birds unbounded fly, And with musick fill the sky, Now, ev'n now, my joys run high. Be full, ye courts, be great who will; Search for peace with all your skill: Open wide the lofty door, Seek her on the marble floor, In vain you search, she is not there; In vain ye search the domes of care! Grass and flowers Quiet treads, On the meads and mountain-heads, Along with Pleasure, close ally'd Ever by each other's side: And often, by the murm'ring rill, Hears the thrush, while all is still, Within the groves of Grongar Hill. THE RUINS of ROME. A POEM. By the Same. Aspice murorum moles, præruptaque saxa, Obrutaque horrenti vasta theatra situ: Hæc sunt Roma. Viden' velut ipsa cadavera tantæ Urbis adhuc spirent imperiosa minas? Janus Vitalis. Enough of Grongar, and the shady dales Of winding Towy, Merlin's fabled haunt, I sung inglorious. Now the love of arts, And what in metal or in stone remains Of proud antiquity, thro' various realms And various languages and ages fam'd, Bears me remote, o'er Gallia's woody bounds, O'er the cloud-piercing Alps remote; beyond The vale of Arno purpled with the vine, Beyond the Umbrian and Etruscan hills, To Latium's wide champain, forlorn and waste, Where yellow Tiber his neglected wave Mournfully rolls. Yet once again, my Muse, Yet once again, and soar a loftier flight; Lo the resistless theme, imperial Rome. Fall'n, fall'n, a silent heap; her heroes all Sunk in their urns; behold the pride of pomp, The throne of nations fall'n; obscure in dust; Ev'n yet majestical; the solemn scene Elates the soul, while now the rising sun Flames on the ruins in the purer air Tow'ring aloft, upon the glitt'ring plain, Like broken rocks, a vast circumference; Rent palaces, crush'd columns, rifted moles, Fanes roll'd on fanes, and tombs on buried tombs. Deep lies in dust the Theban obelisc, Immense along the waste; minuter art, Gliconian forms, or Phidian, subtly fair, O'erwhelming; as th'immense Leviathan The finny brood, when near Ierne's shore Out-stretch'd, unwieldly, his island length appears Above the foamy flood. Globose and huge, Grey-mould'ring temples swell, and wide o'ercast The solitary landskape, hills and woods, And boundless wilds; while the vine-mantled brows The pendent goats unveil, regardless they Of hourly peril, though the clefted domes Tremble to every wind. The pilgrim oft At dead of night, 'mid his oraison hears Aghast the voice of time, disparting tow'rs, Tumbling all precipitate down-dash'd, Rattling around, loud thund'ring to the moon: While murmurs sooth each aweful interval Of ever-falling waters; shrouded Nile Fountains at Rome adorned with the statues of those rivers., Eridanus, and Tiber with his twins, And palmy Euphrates; they with dropping locks, Hang o'er their urns, and mournfully among The plaintive-echoing ruins pour their streams. Yet here advent'rous in the sacred search Of ancient arts, the delicate of mind, Curious and modest, from all climes resort, Grateful society! with these I raise The toilsome step up the proud Palatin, Through spiry cypress groves, and tow'ring pine, Waving aloft o'er the big ruins brows, On num'rous arches rear'd: and frequent stopp'd, The sunk ground startles me with dreadful chasm, Breathing forth darkness from the vast profound Of isles and halls, within the mountain's womb. Nor these the nether works; all these beneath, And all beneath the vales and hills around, Extend the cavern'd sewers, massy, firm, As the Sibyline grot beside the dead Lake of Avernus; such the sewers huge, Whither the great Tarquinian genius dooms Each wave impure; and proud with added rains, Hark how the mighty billows lash their vaults, And thunder; how they heave their rocks in vain! Though now incessant Time has roll'd around A thousand winters o'er the changeful world, And yet a thousand since, th'indignant floods Roar loud in their firm bounds, and dash and swell, In vain; convey'd to Tiber's lowest wave. Hence over airy plains, by crystal founts, That weave their glitt'ring waves with tuneful lapse, Among the sleeky pebbles, agate clear, Cerulean ophite, and the flow'ry vein Of orient jasper, pleas'd I move along, And vases boss'd, and huge inscriptive stones, And intermingling vines; and figur'd nymphs, Flora's and Chloe's of delicious mould, Cheering the darkness; and deep empty tombs, And dells, and mould'ring shrines, with old decay Rustick and green and wide-embow'ring shades, Shot from the crooked clefts of nodding tow'rs; A solemn wilderness! With error sweet, I wind the ling'ring step, where-e'er the path Mazy conducts me, which the vulgar foot O'er sculptures maim'd has made; Anubis, Sphinx, Idols of antique guise, and horned Pan, Terrifick, monstrous shapes! propost'rous gods, Of Fear and Ign'rance, by the sculptor's hand Hewn into form, and worship'd; as ev'n now Blindly they worship at their breathless mouths Several statues of the Pagan gods have been converted into images of saints. In varied appellations: men to these (From depth to depth in dark'ning error fall'n) At length ascrib'd th'Inapplicable Name. How doth it please and fill the memory With deeds of brave renown, while on each hand Historick urns and breathing statues rise, And speaking busts! Sweet Scipio, Marius stern, Pompey superb, the spirit-stirring form Of Cæsar raptur'd with the charm of rule And boundless fame; impatient for exploits, His eager eyes upcast, he soars in thought Above all height: and his own Brutus see, Desponding Brutus, dubious of the right, In evil days, of faith, of publick weal Solicitous and sad. Thy next regard Be Tully's graceful attitude; uprais'd, His out-stretch'd arm he waves, in act to speak Before the silent masters of the world, And eloquence arrays him. There behold Prepar'd for combat in the front of war The pious brothers; jealous Alba stands In fearful expectation of the strife, And youthful Rome intent: the kindred foes Fall on each other's neck in silent tears; In sorrowful benevolence embrace— Howe'er they soon unsheath the flashing sword, Their country calls to arms, now all in vain The mother clasps the knee, and ev'n the fair Now weeps in vain; their country calls to arms. Such virtue Clelia, Cocles, Manlius, rous'd; Such were the Fabii, Decii; so inspir'd The Scipio's battled, and the Gracchi spoke: So rose the Roman state. Me now, of these Deep-musing, high ambitious thoughts inflame Greatly to serve my country, distant land, And build me virtuous fame; nor shall the dust Of these fall'n piles with shew of sad decay Avert the good resolve, mean argument, The fate alone of matter.—Now the brow We gain enraptur'd; beauteously distinct From the Palatin hill one sees most of the remarkable antiquities. The num'rous portico's and domes upswell, With obeliscs and columns interpos'd, And pine, and fir, and oak: so fair a scene Sees not the dervise from the spiral tomb Of ancient Chammos, while his eye beholds Proud Memphis' reliques o'er th'Ægyptian plain: Nor hoary hermit from Hymettus' brow, Though graceful Athens, in the vale beneath. Along the windings of the Muse's stream, Lucid Ilyssus, weeps her silent schools, And groves, unvisited by bard or sage. Amid the tow'ry ruins, huge, supreme, Th'enormous amphitheatre behold, Mountainous pile! o'er whose capacious womb Pours the broad firmament its varied light; While from the central floor the seats ascend Round above round, slow-wid'ning to the verge, A circuit vast and high; nor less had held Imperial Rome, and her attendant realms, When drunk with rule she will'd the fierce delight, And op'd the gloomy caverns, whence out-rush'd Before th'innumerable shouting crowd The fiery, madded, tyrants of the wilds, Lions and tygers, wolves and elephants, And desp'rate men, more fell. Abhorr'd intent! By frequent converse with familiar death, To kindle brutal daring apt for war; To lock the breast, and steel th'obdurate heart, Amid the piercing cries of sore distress Impenetrable.—But away thine eye; Behold yon steepy cliff; the modern pile Perchance may now delight, while that rever'd The Capitol. In ancient days, the page alone declares, Or narrow coin through dim cærulean rust. The fane was Jove's, its spacious golden roof, O'er thick-surrounding temples beaming wide, Appear'd, as when above the morning hills Half the round sun ascends; and tow'r'd aloft, Sustain'd by columns huge, innumerous As cedars proud on Canaan's verdant heights Dark'ning their idols, when Astarte lur'd Too prosp'rous Israel from his living strength. And next regard yon venerable dome, Which virtuous Latium, with erroneous aim, Rais'd to her various deities, and nam'd Pantheon; plain and round; of this our world Majestick emblem; with peculiar grace, Before its ample orb, projected stands The many-pillar'd portal; noblest work Of human skill, here, curious architect, If thou assay'st, ambitious, to surpass Palladius, Angelus, or British Jones, On these fair walls extend the certain scale, And turn th'instructive compass: careful mark How far in hidden art, the noble plain Extends, and where the lovely forms commence Of flowing sculpture: nor neglect to note How range the taper columns, and what weight Their leafy brows sustain: fair Corinth first Boasted their order which Callimachus (Reclining studious on Asopus' banks Beneath an urn of some lamented nymph) Haply compos'd; the urn with foliage curl'd Thinly conceal'd, the chapiter inform'd. See the tall obeliscs from Memphis old, One stone enormous each, or Thebes convey'd; Like Albion's spires they rush into the skies. And there the temple, where the summon'd state The temple of Concord, where the senate met on Catiline's conspiracy. In deep of night conven'd: ev'n yet methinks The veh'ment orator in rent attire Persuasion pours, ambition sinks her crest; And lo the villain, like a troubled sea, That tosses up her mire! Ever disguis'd, Shall treason walk? shall proud oppression yoke The neck of virtue? Lo the wretch abash'd, Self-betray'd Catiline! O Liberty, Parent of happiness, celestial born; When the first man became a living soul, His sacred genius thou; be Britain's care; With her secure, prolong thy lov'd retreat; Thence bless mankind; while yet among her sons, Ev'n yet there are, to shield thine equal laws, Whose bosoms kindle at the sacred names Of Cecil, Raleigh, Walsingham, and Drake. May others more delight in tuneful airs; In masque and dance excell; to sculptur'd stone Give with superior skill the living look; More pompous piles erect, or pencil soft With warmer touch the visionary board: Be thou, thy nobler Britons teach to rule; To check the ravage of tyrannick sway; To quell the proud; to spread the joys of peace And various blessings of ingenious trade. Be these our arts; and ever may we guard, Ever defend thee with undaunted heart, Inestimable good! who giv'st us Truth, Whose hand upleads to light, divinest Truth, Array'd in ev'ry charm: whose hand benign Teaches unwearied toil to cloath the fields, And on his various fruits inscribes the name Of Property: O nobly hail'd of old By thy majestick daughters, Judah fair, And Tyrus and Sidonia, lovely nymphs, And Libya bright, and all-enchanting Greece, Whose num'rous towns and isles, and peopled seas, Rejoic'd around her lyre; th'heroic note (Smit with sublime delight) Ausonia caught, And plan'd imperial Rome. Thy hand benign Rear'd up her tow'ry battlements in strength; Bent her wide bridges o'er the swelling stream Of Tuscan Tiber; thine those solemn domes Devoted to the voice of humble pray'r; And thine those piles undeck'd, capacious, vast The publick granaries. In days of dearth, where tender Charity Dispens'd her timely succours to the poor. Thine too those musically-falling founts To slake the clammy lip; adown they fall, Musical ever; while from yon blue hills Dim in the clouds, the radiant aqueducts Turn their innumerable arches o'er The spacious desert, bright'ning in the sun, Proud and more proud, in their august approach: High o'er irriguous vales and woods and towns, Glide the soft whispering waters in the wind, And here united pour their silver streams Among the figur'd rocks, in murm'ring falls, Musical ever. These thy beauteous works: And what beside felicity could tell Of human benefit: more late the rest; At various times their turrets chanc'd to rise, When impious tyranny vouchsaf'd to smile. Behold by Tiber's flood, where modern Rome Modern Rome stands chiefly on the old Campus Martius. Couches beneath the ruins: there of old With arms and trophies gleam'd the field of Mars: There to their daily sports the noble youth Rush'd emulous; to fling the pointed lance; To vault the steed; or with the kindling wheel In dusty whirlwinds sweep the trembling goal; Or wrestling, cope with adverse swelling breasts, Strong, grappling arms, clos'd heads, and distant feet; Or clash the lifted gauntlets: there they form'd Their ardent virtues: lo the bossy piles, The proud triumphal arches; all their wars, Their conquests, honours, in the sculptures live. And see from every gate those ancient roads, With tombs high-verg'd, the solemn paths of Fame: Deserve they not regard? O'er whose broad flints Such crowds have roll'd, so many storms of war; Such trains of consuls, tribunes, sages, kings; So many pomps; so many wond'ring realms: Yet still through mountains pierc'd, o'er vallies rais'd, In even state, to distant seas around, They stretch their pavements. Lo the fane of Peace, Built by that prince, who to the trust of pow'r Begun by Vespasian, and finished by Titus. Was honest, the delight of human kind. Three nodding isles remain; the rest an heap Of sand and weeds; her shrines, her radiant roofs And columns proud, that from her spacious floor, As from a shining sea, majestick rose An hundred foot aloft, like stately beech Around the brim of Dion's glassy lake, Charming the mimick painter: on the walls Hung Salem's sacred spoils; the golden board, And golden trumpets, now conceal'd, entomb'd By the sunk roof.—O'er which in distant view Th'Etruscan mountains swell, with ruins crown'd Of ancient towns; and blue Soracte spires, Wrapping his sides in tempests. Eastward hence, Nigh where the Cestian pyramid divides The tomb of Cestius, partly within, and partly without the walls. The mould'ring wall, behold yon fabrick huge, Whose dust the solemn antiquarian turns, And thence in broken sculptures cast abroad, Like Sybil's leaves, collects the builder's name Rejoic'd, and the green medals frequent found Doom Caracalla to perpetual fame: The stately pines, that spread their branches wide In the dun ruins of its ample halls, The baths of Caracalla, a vast ruin. Appear but tufts; as may whate'er is high Sink in comparison, minute and vile. These, and unnumber'd, yet their brows uplift, Rent of their graces; as Britannia's oaks On Merlin's mount, or Snowden's rugged sides, Stand in the clouds, their branches scatter'd round, After the tempest; Mausoleums, Cirques, Naumachios, Forums; Trajan's column tall, From whose low base the sculptures wind aloft, And lead through various toils, up the rough steep, Its hero to the skies: and his dark tow'r Nero's. Whose execrable hand the city fir'd, And while the dreadful conflagration blaz'd, Play'd to the flames; and Phœbus' letter'd dome; The Palatin library. And the rough reliques of Carinæ's street, Where now the shepherd to his nibbling sheep Sits piping with his oaten reed; as erst There pip'd the shepherd to his nibbling sheep, When th'humble roof Anchises' son explor'd Of good Evander, wealth-despising king, Amid the thickets: so revolves the scene; So time ordains, who rolls the things of pride From dust again to dust. Behold that heap Of mould'ring urns (their ashes blown away, Dust of the mighty) the same story tell; And at its base, from whence the serpent glides Down the green desert street, yon hoary monk Laments the same, the vision as he views, The solitary, silent, solemn scene, Where Cæsars, heroes, peasants, hermits lie, Blended in dust together; where the slave Rests from his labours; where th'insulting proud Resigns his pow'r; the miser drops his hoard; Where human folly sleeps.—There is a mood, (I sing not to the vacant and the young) There is a kindly mood of melancholy, That wings the soul, and points her to the skies; When tribulation cloaths the child of man, When age descends with sorrow to the grave, 'Tis sweetly-soothing sympathy to pain, A gently wak'ning call to health and ease. How musical! when all-devouring Time, Here sitting on his throne of ruins hoar, While winds and tempests sweep his various lyre, How sweet thy diapason, Melancholy! Cool ev'ning comes; the setting sun displays His visible great round between yon tow'rs, As through two shady cliffs; away, my Muse, Though yet the prospect pleases, ever new In vast variety, and yet delight The many-figur'd sculptures of the path Half beauteous, half effac'd; the traveller Such antique marbles to his native land Oft hence conveys; and ev'ry realm and state With Rome's august remains, heroes and gods, Deck their long galleries and winding groves; Yet miss we not th'innumerable thefts, Yet still profuse of graces teems the waste. Suffice it now th'Esquilian mount to reach With weary wing, and seek the sacred rests Of Maro's humble tenement; a low Plain wall remains; a little sun-gilt heap, Grotesque and wild; the gourd and olive brown Weave the light roof; the gourd and olive fan Their am'rous foliage, mingling with the vine, Who drops her purple clusters through the green. Here let me lie, with pleasing fancy sooth'd: Here flow'd his fountain; here his laurels grew; Here oft the meek good man, the lofty bard Fram'd the celestial song, or social walk'd With Horace and the ruler of the world; Happy Augustus! who so well inspir'd Could'st throw thy pomps and royalties aside, Attentive to the wise, the great of soul, And dignify thy mind. Thrice glorious days, Auspicious to the Muses! then rever'd, Then hallow'd was the fount, or secret shade, Or open mountain, or whatever scene The poet chose to tune th'ennobling rhime Melodious; ev'n the rugged sons of war, Ev'n the rude hinds rever'd the Poet's name: But now—another age, alas! is ours— Yet will the Muse a little longer soar, Unless the clouds of care weigh down her wing, Since nature's stores are shut with cruel hand, And each aggrieves his brother; since in vain The thirsty pilgrim at the fountain asks Th'o'erflowing wave—Enough—the plaint disdain.— See'st thou yon fane? ev'n now incessant time The temple of Romulus and Remus under mount Palatin. Sweeps her low mould'ring marbles to the dust; And Phœbus' temple, nodding with its woods Threatens huge ruin o'er the small rotund. 'Twas there beneath a fig-tree's umbrage broad, Th'astonish'd swains with rev'rend awe beheld Thee, O Quirinus, and thy brother-twin, Pressing the teat within a monster's grasp Sportive; while oft the gaunt and rugged wolf Turn'd her stretch'd neck and form'd your tender limbs: So taught of Jove, ev'n the fell savage fed Your sacred infancies, your virtues, toils, The conquests, glories, of th'Ausonian state, Wrapp'd in their secret seeds. Each kindred soul, Robust and stout, ye grapple to your hearts, And little Rome appears. Her cots arise, Green twigs of osier weave the slender walls, Green rushes spread the roofs; and here and there Opens beneath the rock the gloomy cave. Elate with joy Etruscan Tiber views Her spreading scenes enamelling his waves, Her huts and hollow dells, and flocks and herds, And gath'ring swains; and rolls his yellow car To Neptune's court with more majestick train. Her speedy growth alarm'd the states around Jealous, yet soon by wond'rous virtue won, They sink into her bosom. From the plough Rose her dictators; fought, o'ercame, return'd, Yes, to the plough return'd, and hail'd their peers; For then no private pomp, no houshold state, The publick only swell'd the gen'rous breast. Who has not heard the Fabian heroes sung? Dentatus' scars, or Mutius' flaming hand? How Manlius sav'd the Capitol? the choice Of steady Regulus? As yet they stood, Simple of life; as yet seducing wealth Was unexplor'd, and shame of poverty Yet unimagin'd—Shine not all the fields With various fruitage? murmur not the brooks Along the flow'ry vallies? They, content, Feasted at nature's hand, indelicate, Blithe, in their easy taste; and only sought To know their duties; that their only strife, Their gen'rous strife, and greatly to perform. They through all shapes of peril and of pain, Intent on honour, dar'd in thickest death To snatch the glorious deed. Nor Trebia quell'd, Nor Thrasymene, nor Cannæ's bloody field, Their dauntless courage; storming Hannibal In vain the thunder of the battle roll'd, The thunder of the battle they return'd Back on his Punick shores; 'till Carthage fell, And danger fled afar. The city gleam'd With precious spoils: alas prosperity! Ah baneful state! yet ebb'd not all their strength In soft luxurious pleasures; proud desire Of boundless sway, and fev'rish thirst of gold, Rous'd them again to battle. Beauteous Greece, Torn from her joys, in vain with languid arm Half rais'd her rusty shield; nor could avail The sword of Dacia, nor the Parthian dart; Nor yet the car of that fam'd British chief, Which seven brave years beneath the doubtful wing Of vict'ry, dreadful roll'd its griding wheels Over the bloody war: the Roman arms Triumph'd, 'till Fame was silent of their foes. And now the world unrivall'd they enjoy'd In proud security: the crested helm, The plated greave and corselet hung unbrac'd; Nor clank'd their arms, the spear and sounding shield, But on the glitt'ring trophy to the wind. Dissolv'd in ease and soft delights they lie, 'Till ev'ry sun annoys, and ev'ry wind Has chilling force, and ev'ry rain offends: For now the frame no more is girt with strength Masculine, nor in lustiness of heart Laughs at the winter storm, and summer beam, Superior to their rage: enfeebling vice Withers each nerve, and opens every pore To painful feeling: flow'ry bow'rs they seek (As æther prompts, as the sick sense approves) Or cool Nymphean grots; or tepid baths (Taught by the soft Ionians) they, along The lawny vale, of ev'ry beauteous stone, Pile in the roseat air with fond expence: Through silver channels glide the vagrant waves, And fall on silver beds crystalline down, Melodious murmuring; while luxury Over their naked limbs, with wanton hand, Sheds roses, odours, sheds unheeded bane. Swift is the flight of wealth; unnumber'd wants, Brood of volupt'ousness, cry out aloud Necessity, and seek the splendid bribe. The citron board, the bowl emboss'd with gems, And tender foliage wildly wreath'd around Of seeming ivy, by that artful hand, Corinthian Thericles; whate'er is known Of rarest acquisition; Tyrian garbs, Neptunian Albion's high testaceous food, And flavour'd Chian wines with incense fum'd To shake Patrician thirst: for these, their rights In the vile streets they prostitute to sale; Their ancient rights, their dignities, their laws, Their native glorious freedom. Is there none, Is there no villain, that will bind the neck Stretch'd to the yoke? they come; the market throngs. But who has most by fraud or force amass'd? Who most can charm corruption with his doles? He be the monarch of the state; and lo! Didius, vile us'rer, through the crowd he mounts, Didius Julianus, who bought the empire. Beneath his feet the Roman eagle cow'rs, And the red arrows fill his grasp uncouth. O Britons, O my countrymen, beware, Gird, gird your hearts; the Romans once were free, Were brave, were virtuous.—Tyranny howe'er Deign'd to walk forth awhile in pageant state, And with licentious pleasures fed the rout, The thoughtless many: to the wanton sound Of fifes and drums they danc'd, or in the shade Sung Cæsar, great and terrible in war, Immortal Cæsar! lo, a God, a God, He cleaves the yielding skies! Cæsar mean while Gathers the ocean pebbles; or the gnat Enrag'd pursues; or at his lonely meal Starves a wide province; tastes, dislikes, and flings To dogs and sycophants: a God, a God! The flow'ry shades and shrines obscene return. But see along the north the tempest swell O'er the rough Alps, and darken all their snows! Sudden the Goth and Vandal, dreaded names, Rush as the breach of waters, whelming all Their domes, their villa's; down the festive piles, Down fall their Parian porches, gilded baths, And roll before the storm in clouds of dust. Vain end of human strength, of human skill, Conquest, and triumph, and domain, and pomp, And ease and luxury! O luxury, Bane of elated life, of affluent states, What dreary change, what ruin is not thine? How doth thy bowl intoxicate the mind! To the soft entrance of thy rosy cave How dost thou lure the fortunate and great! Dreadful attraction! while behind thee gapes Th'unfathomable gulph where Ashur lies O'erwhelm'd, forgotten; and high-boasting Cham; And Elam's haughty pomp; and beauteous Greece; And the great queen of earth, imperial Rome. THE SCHOOL-MISTRESS. A POEM, In Imitation of Spenser. By William Shenstone, Esq; Auditæ voces, vagitus &amp; ingens, Infantumque animæ flentes in Limine primo. Virg. ADVERTISEMENT. What particulars in Spenser were imagin'd most proper for the Author's imitation on this occasion, are his language, his simplicity, his manner of description, and a peculiar tenderness of sentiment remarkable throughout his works. I Ah me! full sorely is my heart forlorn, To think how modest worth neglected lies; While partial fame doth with her blasts adorn Such deeds alone, as pride and pomp disguise; Deeds of ill sort, and mischievous emprize! Lend me thy clarion, goddess! let me try To sound the praise of merit, ere it dies; Such as I oft have chaunced to espy, Lost in the dreary shades of dull obscurity. II In every village mark'd with little spire, Embow'r'd in trees, and hardly known to Fame, There dwells, in lowly shed, and mean attire, A matron old whom we school-mistress name; Who boasts unruly brats with birch to tame. They grieven sore, in piteous durance pent, Aw'd by the pow'r of this relentless dame; And oft-times on vagaries idly bent, For unkempt hair, or task unconn'd, are sorely shent. III And all in sight doth rise a birchen tree, Which Learning near her little dome did stowe; Whilom a twig of small regard to see, Tho' now so wide its waving branches flow; And work the simple vassals mickle woe; For not a wind might curl the leaves that blew, But their limbs shudder'd, and their pulse beat low; And, as they look'd, they found their horror grew, And shap'd it into rods, and tingled at the view. IV So have I seen (who has not, may conceive,) A lifeless phantom near a garden plac'd: So doth it wanton birds of peace bereave, Of sport, of song, of pleasure, of repast; They start, they stare, they wheel, they look aghast: Sad servitude! such comfortless annoy May no bold Briton's riper age e'er taste! Ne Superstition clog his dance of joy, Ne vision empty, vain, his native bliss destroy. V Near to this dome is found a patch so green, On which the tribe their gambols do display; And at the door impris'ning board is seen, Lest weakly wights of smaller size shou'd stray; Eager, perdie, to bask in sunny day! The noises intermix'd, which thence resound, Do Learning's little tenement betray: Where sits the dame, disguis'd in look profound, And eyes her fairy throng, and turns her wheel around. VI Her cap, far whiter than the driven snow, Emblem right meet of decency does yield: Her apron dy'd in grain, as blue, I trowe, As is the Hare-bell that adorns the field: And in her hand, for scepter, she does wield Tway birchen sprays; with anxious Fear entwin'd, With dark Distrust, and sad Repentance fill'd; And stedfast Hate, and sharp Affliction join'd, And Fury uncontroul'd, and Chastisement unkind. VII Few but have ken'd, in semblance meet pourtray'd, The childish faces of old Eol's train; Libs, Notus, Auster: these in frowns array'd, How then would fare or earth, or sky, or main, Were the stern god to give his slaves the rein? And were not she rebellious breasts to quell, And were not she her statutes to maintain, The cott no more, I ween, were deem'd the cell, Where comely peace of mind, and decent order dwell. VIII A russet stole was o'er her shoulders thrown; A russet kirtle fenc'd the nipping air; 'Twas simple russet, but it was her own; 'Twas her own country bred the flock so fair; 'Twas her own labour did the fleece prepare; And sooth to say, her pupils, rang'd around, Thro' pious awe, did term it passing rare; For they in gaping wonderment abound, And think, no doubt, she been the greatest wight on ground. IX Albeit ne flatt'ry did corrupt her truth, Ne pompous title did debauch her ear; Goody, good-woman, gossip, n'aunt, forsooth, Or dame, the sole additions she did hear; Yet these he challeng'd, these she held right dear: Ne would esteem him act as mought behove, Who should not honour'd eld with these revere: For never title yet so mean could prove, But there was eke a Mind which did that title love. X One ancient hen she took delight to feed, The plodding pattern of the busy dame; Which, ever and anon, impell'd by need, Into her school, begirt with chickens, came; Such favour did her past deportment claim: And, if Neglect had lavish'd on the ground Fragment of bread, she would collect the same; For well she knew, and quaintly could expound, What sin it were to waste the smallest crumb she found. XI Herbs too she knew, and well of each could speak That in her garden sipp'd the silv'ry dew; Where no vain flow'r disclos'd a gaudy streak; But herbs for use, and physick, not a few, Of grey renown, within those borders grew: The tufted Basil, pun-provoking Thyme, Fresh Baum, and Mary-gold of cheerful hue; The lowly Gill that never dares to climb; And more I fain would sing, disdaining here to rhime. XII Yet Euphrasy may not be left unsung, That gives dim eyes to wander leagues around; And pungent Radish, biting infant's tongue; And Plantain ribb'd that heals the reaper's wound; And Marj'ram sweet, in shepherd's posie found; And Lavender, whose spikes of azure bloom Shall be, ere-while, in arid bundles bound, To lurk amidst the labours of her loom, And crown her kerchiefs clean, with mickle rare perfume. XIII And here trim Rosmarine, that whilom crown'd The dantiest garden of the proudest peer; Ere, driven, from its envy'd site, it found A sacred shelter for its branches here; Where edg'd with gold its glitt'ring skirts appear. Oh wassel days; O customs meet and well! Ere this was banish'd from its lofty sphere: Simplicity then sought this humble cell, Nor ever would She more with thane and lordling dwell. XIV Here oft the dame, on Sabbath's decent eve, Hymned such psalms as Sternhold forth did mete, If winter 'twere, she to her hearth did cleave; But in her garden found a summer seat: Sweet melody! to hear her then repeat How Israel's sons, beneath a foreign king, While taunting foe-men did a song intreat, All, for the Nonce, untuning ev'ry string, Up hung their useless lyres—small heart had they to sing. XV For she was just, and friend too virtuous lore, And pass'd much time in truly virtuous deed; And, in those Elfins ears, would oft deplore The times, when Truth by Popish rage did bleed; And tortious death was true devotion's meed; And simple Faith in iron chains did mourn, That would on wooden image place her creed; And lawny saints in mould'ring flames did burn: Ah! dearest Lord, forefend, thilk days should e'er return. XVI In elbow chair, like that of Scottish stem By the sharp tooth of cank'ring eld defac'd, In which, when he receives his diadem, Our sovereign prince and liefest liege is plac'd, The matron sate; and some with rank she grac'd, (The source of childen's and of courtier's pride!) Redress'd affronts, for vile affronts there pass'd; And warn'd them not the fretful to deride, But love each other dear, whatever them betide. XVII Right well she knew each temper to descry; To thwart the proud, and the submiss to raise; Some with vile copper prize exalt on high, And some entice with pittance small of praise; And other some with baleful sprig she 'frays; Ev'n absent, she the reins of pow'r doth hold, While with quaint arts the giddy crowd she sways; Forewarn'd, if little bird their pranks behold, 'Twill whisper in her ear, and all the scene unfold. XVIII Lo now with state she utters the command! Eftsoons the urchins to their tasks repair; Their books of stature small they take in hand, Which with pellucid horn secured are; To save from finger wet the letters fair: The work so gay, that on their back is seen, St. George's high atchievements does declare; On which thilk wight that has y-gazing been, Kens the forth-coming rod, unpleasing sight, I ween! XIX Ah luckless he, and born beneath the beam Of evil star! it irks me whilst I write! As erst the Spenser. bard by Mulla's silver stream, Oft, as he told of deadly dolorous plight, Sigh'd as he sung, and did in tears indite. For brandishing the rod, she doth begin To loose the brogues, the stripling's late delight! And down they drop; appears his dainty skin, Fair as the furry coat of whitest Ermilin. XX O ruthful scene! when from a nook obscure, His little sister doth his peril see: All playful as she sate, she grows demure; She finds full soon her wonted spirits flee; She meditates a pray'r to set him free: Nor gentle pardon could this dame deny, (If gentle pardon could with dames agree) To her sad grief that swells in either eye, And wrings her so that all for pity she could dye. XXI Nor longer can she now her shrieks command; And hardly she forbears, thro' aweful fear, To rushen forth, and, with presumptuous hand, To stay harsh justice in its mid career. On thee she calls, on thee her parent dear! (Ah! too remote to ward the shameful blow!) She sees no kind domestick visage near, And soon a flood of tears begins to flow; And gives a loose at last to unavailing woe. XXII But ah! what pen his piteous plight may trace? Or what device his loud laments explain? The form uncouth of his disguised face? The pallid hue that dyes his looks amain? The plenteous show'r that does his cheek distain? When he, in abject wise, implores the dame, Ne hopeth ought of sweet reprieve to gain; Or when from high she levels well her aim, And, thro' the thatch, his cries each falling stroke proclaim. XXIII The other tribe, aghast, with sore dismay, Attend, and conn their tasks with mickle care: By turns, astony'd, ev'ry twig survey, And, from their fellow's hateful wounds, beware; Knowing, I wist, how each the same may share; Till Fear has taught them a performance meet, And to the well-known chest the dame repair; Whence oft with sugar'd cates she doth 'em greet, And ginger-bread y-rare; now, certes, doubly sweet! XXIV See to their seats they hye with merry glee, And in beseemly order sitten there; All but the wight of bum y-galled, he Abhorreth bench and stool, and fourm, and chair; (This hand in mouth y-fix'd, that rends his hair;) And eke with snubs profound, and heaving breast, Convulsions intermitting! does declare His grievous wrong; his dame's unjust behest; And scorns her offer'd love, and shuns to be caress'd. XXV His face besprent with liquid crystal shines, His blooming face that seems a purple flow'r, Which low to earth its drooping head declines, All smear'd and sully'd by a vernal show'r. O the hard bosoms of despotick pow'r! All, all, but she, the author of his shame, All, all, but she, regret this mournful hour: Yet hence the youth, and hence the flow'r, shall claim, If so I deem aright, transcending worth and fame. XXVI Behind some door, in melancholy thought, Mindless of food, he, dreary caitiff! pines; Ne for his fellow's joyaunce careth ought, But to the wind all merriment resigns; And deems it shame, if he to peace inclines; And many a sullen look ascance is sent, Which for his dame's annoyance he designs; And still the more to pleasure him she's bent, The more doth he, perverse, her haviour past resent. XXVII Ah me! how much I fear lest pride it be! But if that pride it be, which thus inspires, Beware, ye dames, with nice discernment see, Ye quench not too the sparks of nobler fires: Ah! better far than all the Muses' lyres, All coward arts, is valour's gen'rous heat; The firm fixt breast which Fit and Right requires, Like Vernon's patriot soul; more justly great Than craft that pimps for ill, or flow'ry false deceit. XXVIII Yet nurs'd with skill, what dazling fruits appear! Ev'n now sagacious Foresight points to show A little bench of heedless bishops here, And there a chancellour in embryo, Or bard sublime, if bard may e'er be so, As Milton, Shakespeare, names that ne'er shall dye! Tho' now he crawl along the ground so low, Nor weeting how the Muse shou'd soar on high, Wisheth, poor starving elf! his paper-kite may fly. XXIX And this perhaps, who, cens'ring the design, Low lays the house which that of cards doth build, Shall Dennis be! if rigid fates incline, And many an Epick to his rage shall yield; And many a poet quit th'Aonian field; And, sour'd by age, profound he shall appear, As he who now with 'sdainful fury thrill'd Surveys mine work; and levels many a sneer, And furls his wrinkly front, and cries “What stuff is here?” XXX But now Dan Phœbus gains the middle skie, And Liberty unbars their prison-door; And like a rushing torrent out they fly, And now the grassy cirque han cover'd o'er With boist'rous revel-rout and wild uproar; A thousand ways in wanton rings they run, Heav'n shield their short-liv'd pastimes, I implore! For well may Freedom, erst so dearly won, Appear to British elf more gladsome than the sun. XXXI Enjoy, poor imps! enjoy your sportive trade; And chase gay flies, and cull the fairest flow'rs; For when my bones in grass-green sods are laid; For never may ye taste more careless hours In knightly castles, or in ladies bow'rs. O vain to seek delight in earthly thing! But most in courts where proud Ambition tow'rs; Deluded wight! who weens fair peace can spring Beneath the pompous dome of kesar or of king. XXXII See in each sprite some various bent appear! These rudely carol most incondite lay; Those saunt'ring on the green, with jocund leer Salute the stranger passing on his way; Some building fragile tenements of clay; Some to the standing lake their courses bend, With pebbles smooth at duck and drake to play; Thilk to the huxter's sav'ry cottage tend, In pastry kings and queens th'allotted mite to spend. XXXIII Here, as each season yields a different store, Each season's stores in order ranged been; Apples with cabbage-net y-cover'd o'er, Galling full sore th'unmoney'd wight are seen; And goose-b'rie clad in liv'ry red or green; And here of lovely dye, the Cath'rine pear, Fine pear! as lovely for thy juice, I ween: O may no wight e'er penny-less come there, Lest smit with ardent love he pine with hopeless care! XXXIV See! cherries here, ere cherries yet abound, With thread so white in tempting posies ty'd, Scatt'ring like blooming maid their glances round, With pamper'd look draw little eyes aside; And must be bought though penury betide. The plumb all azure and the nut all brown, And here each season, do those cakes abide, Whose honour'd names th'inventive city own, Rend'ring thro' Britain's isle Salopia's praises known. Shrewsbury cakes. XXXV Admir'd Salopia! that with venial pride Eyes her bright form in Severn's ambient wave, Fam'd for her loyal cares in perils tried, Her daughters lovely, and her striplings brave; Ah! 'midst the rest, may flowers adorn his grave, Whose art did first these dulcet cates display! A motive fair to Learning's imps he gave, Who cheerless o'er her darkling region stray; 'Till reason's morn arise, and light them on their way. THE ART of POLITICKS, In Imitation of HORACE's ART of POETRY By the Reverend Mr. Bramston. If to an human face sir James shou'd draw A horse's mane, and feathers of maccaw, A lady's bosom, and a tail of cod, Who could help laughing at a sight so odd? Just such a monster, Sirs, pray think before ye, When you behold one man both Whig and Tory. Not more extravagant are drunkards dreams, Than Low-church politicks with High-church schemes. Painters, you'll say, may their own fancies use, And free-born Britons may their party chuse: That's true, I own: but can one piece be drawn For dove and dragon, elephant and fawn? Speakers profess'd, who gravity pretend, With motly sentiments their speeches blend; Begin like patriots, and like courtiers end. Some love to roar, the constitution's broke, And others on the nation's debts to joke; Some rail, (they hate a commonwealth so much,) Whate'er the subject be, against the Dutch; While others, with more fashionable fury, Begin with turnpikes, and conclude with Fleury. Some, when th'affair was Blenheim's glorious battle, Declaim'd against importing Irish cattle: But you, from whate'er side you take your name, Like Anna's motto, always be the same. Outsides deceive, 'tis hard the truth to know, Parties from quaint denominations flow, As Scotch and Irish antiquaries show. The low are said to rake Fanaticks parts, The high are bloody Papists in their hearts. Caution and fear to highest faults have run; In pleasing both the parties, you please none. Who in the house affects declaiming airs, Whales in Change-alley paints: in Fish-street bears. Some metaphors, some hankerchiefs display, These peep in hats, while those with buttons play, And make me think it Repetition day; There knights haranguing hug a neighb'ring post, And are but quorum orators at most. Sooner than thus my want of sense expose, I'll deck out bandy-legs with gold-clock'd hose, Or wear a toupet-wig without a nose. Nay, I would sooner have thy phyz, I swear, Surintendant des plaisirs d'Angleterre. All Mr. Heydegger's letters come directed to him from abroad, A Monsieur, Monsieur Heydegger, surintendant des plaisirs d'Angleterre. Ye weekly writers of seditious news, Take care your subjects artfully to chuse, Write panegyrick strong, or boldly rail, You cannot miss preferment, or a goal. Wrap up your poison well, nor fear to say What was a lye last night is truth to-day. Tell this, sink that, arrive at Ridpath's praise, Let Abel Roper your ambition raise. To lie fit opportunity observe, Saving some double meaning in reserve; But oh! you'll merit everlasting fame, If you can quibble on Sir Robert's name. In state-affairs use not the vulgar phrase, Talk words scarce known in good queen Besse's days, New terms let war or traffick introduce, And try to bring persuading-ships in use. Coin words: in coining ne'er mind common sense, Provided the original be French. Like South-sea stock, expressions rise and fall: King Edward's words are now no words at all. Did aught our predecessors genius cramp? Sure every reign may have its proper stamp. All sublunary things of death partake; What alteration does a cent'ry make? Kings and comedians are all mortal found, Cæsar and Pinkethman are underground. What's not destroy'd by Time's devouring hand? Where's Troy, and where's the may-pole in the Strand? Pease, cabbages, and turnips once grew, where Now stands New Bond-street, and a newer square; Such piles of buildings now rise up and down, London itself seems going out of town. Our fathers cross'd from Fulham in a wherry, Their sons enjoy a bridge at Putney-ferry. Think we that modern words eternal are? Toupet and Tompion, Cosins, and Colmar Hereafter will be call'd, by some plain man, A wig, a watch, a pair of stays, a fan. To things themselves if time such change affords, Can there be any trusting to our words? To screen good ministers from publick rage, And how with party madness to engage, We learn from Addison's immortal page. The Jacobite's ridiculous opinion Is seen from Tickell's letters to Avignon. But who puts Caleb's Country-Craftsman out, Is still a secret, and the world's in doubt. Not long since parish clerks, with saucy airs, Apply'd king David's psalms to state affairs. Some certain tunes to politicks belong, On both side drunkards love a party-song. If full across the Speaker's chair I go, Can I be said the rules o'th' House to know? I'll ask, nor give offence without intent, Nor through mere sheepishness be impudent. In acts of Parliament avoid sublime, Nor e'er address his Majesty in rhyme; An Act of Parliament's a serious thing, Begins with year of Lord and year of King; Keeps close to form, in every word is strict, When it would pains and penalties inflict. Soft words suit best petitioner's intent; Soft words, O ye petitioners of Kent! Whoe'er harangues before he gives his vote, Should send sweet language from a tuneful throat. Pultney the coldest breast with zeal can fire, And Roman thoughts by Attick stile inspire; He knows from tedious wranglings to beguile The serious house into a cheerful smile; When the great patriot paints his anxious fears For England's safety, I am lost in tears. But when dull speakers strive to move compassion, I pity their poor hearers, not the nation: Unless young members to the purpose keep, I fall a laughing, or I fall asleep. Can men their inward faculties controul? Is not the tongue an index to the soul? Laugh not in time of service to your God, Nor bully, when in custody o'th' rod; Look grave, and be from jokes and grinning far, When brought to sue for pardon at the bar: If then you let your ill-tim'd wit appear, Knights, citizens, and burgesses will sneer. For land, or trade, not the same notions fire The city-merchant, and the country-'squire; Their climes are distant, tho' one cause unites The lairds of Scotland, and the Cornish knights. To likelihood your characters confine; Don't turn Sir Paul out, let Sir Paul resign. In Walpole's voice (if factions ill intend) Give the two universities a friend; Give Maidstone wit, and elegance refin'd; To both the Pelhams give the Scipio's mind; To Cart'ret learning, eloquence, and parts; To George the second, give all English hearts. Sometimes fresh names in politicks produce, And factions yet unheard of introduce; And if you dare attempt a thing so new, Make to itself the flying squadron true. To speak is free, no member is debarr'd; But funds and national accounts are hard: Safer on common topicks to discourse, The malt-tax, and a military force. On these each coffee-house will lend a hint, Besides a thousand things that are in print. But steal not word for word, nor thought for thought, For you'll be teaz'd to death, if you are caught. When factious leaders boast increasing strength, Go not too far, nor follow every length: Leave room for change, turn with a grace about, And swear you left 'em, when you found 'em out. With art and modesty your part maintain; And talk like Col'nel Titus, not like Lane. The trading knight with rants his speech begins, Sun, moon, and stars, and dragons, saints, and kings: But Titus said, with his uncommon sense, When the exclusion-bill was in suspence, I hear a lion in the lobby roar; Say, Mr. Speaker, shall we shut the door And keep him there, or shall we let him in To try if we can turn him out again? Some mighty blusterers impeach with noise, And call their private cry, the publick voice. From folio's of accounts they take their handles, Aud the whole ballance proves a pound of candles; As if Paul's cupola were brought to bed, After hard labour, of a small pin's head. Some Rufus, some the Conqueror bring in, And some from Julius Cæsar's days begin. A cunning speaker can command his chops, And when the house is not in humour, stops; In falsehood probability imploys, Nor his old lies with newer lies destroys. If when you speak, you'd hear a needle fall, And make the frequent hear-hims rend the wall, In matters suited to your taste engage, Rememb'ring still your quality and age. Thy task be this, young knight, and hear my song, What politicks to ev'ry age belong. When babes can speak, babes should be taught to say King George the second's health, huzza, huzza! Boys should learn Latin for Prince William's sake, And girls Louisa their example make. More loves the youth, just come to his estate, To range the fields, than in the house debate; More he delights in fav'rite Jowler's tongue, Than in Will Shippen, or Sir William Yonge: If in one chase he can two horses kill, He cares not two-pence for the land-tax bill: Loud in his wine, in women not o'er nice, He damns his uncles if they give advice; Votes as his father did when there's a call, But had much rather never vote at all. We take a different turn at twenty-six, And lofty thoughts on some lord's daughter fix; With men in pow'r strict friendship we pursue, With some considerable post in view. A man of forty years to change his note, One way to speak, and t'other way to vote; Careful his tongue in passion to command, Avoids the bar, and speaker's reprimand. In bags the old man lets his treasure rust, Afraid to use it, or the funds to trust; When stocks are low he wants the heart to buy, And through much caution sees them rise too high; Thinks nothing rightly done since seventy-eight, Swears present members do not talk, but prate: In Charles the second's days, says he, ye prigs, Tories were Tories then, and Whigs were Whigs. Alas! this is a lamentable truth, We lose in age, as we advance in youth: I laugh when twenty will like eighty talk, And old Sir John with Polly Peachum walk. Now as to double, or to false returns, When pockets suffer, and when anger burns; O thing surpassing faith! knight strives with knight When both have brib'd, and neither's in the right, The bailiff's self is sent for in that case, And all the witnesses had face to face. Selected members soon the fraud unfold, In full committee of the house 'tis told; Th'incredible corruption is destroy'd, The chairman's angry, and th'election void. Those who would captivate the well-bred throng, Should not too often speak, nor speak too long: Church, nor church-matters ever turn to sport, Nor make St. Stephen's chapel, Dover-court. The speaker, when the commons are assembled, May to the Græcian chorus be resembled; 'Tis his the young and modest to espouse, And see none draw, or challenge in the house: 'Tis his old hospitality to use, And three good printers for the house to chuse; To let each representative be heard, And take due care the chaplain be preferr'd; To hear no motion made that's out of joint, And when he spies his member, make his point. To knights new chosen in old time would come The country trumpet, and perhaps a drum; Now when a burgess new elect appears, Come trainbands, horseguards, footguards, grenadeers; When the majority the town-clerk tells, His honour pays the fiddles, waits, and bells: Harangues the mob, and is as wise and great, As the most mystick oracle of state. When the duke's grandson for the county stood, His beef was fat, and his october good; His lordship took each ploughman by the fist, Drank to their sons, their wives, their daughters kiss'd; But when strong beer their free-born hearts inflames, They sell him bargains, and they call him names. Thus it is deem'd in English nobles wise To stoop for no one reason but to rise. Election matters shun with cautious awe, O all ye judges learned in the law; A judge by bribes as much himself degrades, As duchess-dowager by masquerades. Try not with jests obscene to force a smile, Nor lard your speech with mother Needham's stile: Let not your tongue to ??????????? run, And ??????????? with abhorrence shun; Let not your looks affected words disgrace, Nor join with silver tongue a brazen face; Let not your hands, like tallboys be employ'd, And the mad rant of tragedy avoid. Just in your thoughts, in your expression clear, Neither too modest, nor too bold appear. Others in vain a like success will boast, He speaks most easy, who has study'd most. A peer's pert heir has to the commons spoke A vile reflection, or a bawdy joke: Call'd to the house of lords, of this beware, 'Tis what the bishops' bench will never bear. Among the commons is such freedom shown, They lash each other, and attack the throne; Yet so unskilful or so fearful some, For nine that speak there's nine-and-forty dumb. When James the first, at great Britannia's helm, Rul'd this word-clipping and word-coining realm, No word to royal favour made pretence, But what agreed in sound and clash'd in sense. Thrice happy he! how great that speaker's praise, Whose ev'ry period look'd an hundred ways. What then? we now with just abhorrence shun The trifling quibble, and the school-boy's pun; Tho' no great connoisseur, I make a shift Just to find out a Durfey from a Swift; I can discern with half an eye, I hope, Mist from Jo Addison; from Eusden, Pope: I know a farce from one of Congreve's plays, And Cibber's opera from Johnny Gay's. When pert Defoe his saucy papers writ, He from a cart was pillor'd for his wit: By mob was pelted half a morning's space, And rotten eggs besmear'd his yellow face; The Censor then improv'd the list'ning isle, And held both parties in an artful smile. A scribbling crew now pinching winter brings, That spare no earthly nor no heav'nly things, Nor church, nor state, nor treasurers, nor kings. But blasphemy displeases all the town; And for defying scripture, law, and crown, Woolston should pay his fine, and lose his gown. It must be own'd the journals try all ways To merit their respective party's praise: They jar in every article from Spain; A war these threaten, those a peace maintain: Tho' lie they will, to give them all their due, In foreign matters, and domestick too. Whoe'er thou art that would'st a Postman write Enquire all day, and hearken all the night. Sure, Gazetteers and writers of Courants Might soon exceed th'intelligence of France: To be out-done old England should refuse, As in her arms, so in her publick news: But truth is scarce, the scene of action large, And correspondence an excessive charge. There are who say, no man can be a wit Unless for Newgate, or for Bedlam fit; Let pamphleteers abusive satire write, To shew a genius is to shew a spite: That author's work will ne'er be reckon'd good, Who has not been where Curll the printer stood. Alas poor me! you may my Fortune guess: I write, and yet humanity profess: (Though nothing can delight a modern judge, Without ill-nature and a private grudge) I love the king, the queen, and royal race: I like the government, but want no place Too low in life to be a justice I, And for a constable, thank God, too high: Was never in a plot, my brain's not hurt; I politicks to poetry convert, A politician must (as I have read) Be furnish'd, in the first place, with a head: A head well fill'd with Machiavelian brains, And stuff'd with precedents of former reigns: Must journals read, and magna charta quote; But acts still wiser, if he speaks by note: Learn well his lesson, and ne'er fear mistakes; For ready-money ready-speakers makes. He must instructions and credentials draw, Pay well the army, and protect the law: Give to his country what's his country's due, But first help brothers, sons, and cousins too. He must read Grotius upon war and peace, And the twelve judges' salary increase. He must oblige old friends and new allies, And find out ways and means for fresh supplies. He must the weavers grievances redress, And merchants wants in merchants words express. Dramatick poets that expect the bays, Should call our histories for party plays; Wickford's Embassador should fill their head, And the State-trials carefully be read: For what is Dryden's muse and Otway's plots, To th'earl of Essex or the queen of Scots? 'Tis said that queen Elizabeth could speak, At twelve years old, right Attick full-mouth'd Greek; Hence was the student forc'd at Greek to grudge, If he would be a bishop or a judge. Divines and lawyers now don't think they thrive, 'Till promis'd places of men still alive: How old is such a one in such a post? The answer is, he's seventy-five almost: Th'archbishop and the master of the rolls? Neither is young, and one's as old as Paul's. Will men that ask such questions, publish books Like learned Hooker's, or chief justice Coke's? On tender subjects with discretion touch, And never say too little or too much. On trivial matters flourishes are wrong, Motions for candles never should be long: Or if you move in case of sudden rain, To shut the windows, speak distinct and plain. Unless you talk good English, downright sense, Can you be understood by serjeant Spence? New stories always should with truth agree, Or truth's half sister, probability: Scarce could Toft's rabbits and pretended throes On half the honourable house impose. When Cato speaks, young Shallow runs away, And swears it is so dull he cannot stay: When rakes begin on blasphemy to border, Bromley and Hanmer cry aloud—to order. The point is this, with manly sense and ease T'inform the judgment, and the fancy please. Praise it deserves, nor difficult the thing, At once to serve one's country, and one's king. Such speeches bring the wealthy Tonsons gain, From age to age they minuted remain, As precedents for George the twentieth's reign. Is there a man on earth so perfect found, Who ne'er mistook a word in sense or sound? Not blund'ring, but persisting is the fault; No mortal sin is Lapsus Linguæ thought: Clerks may mistake; considering who 'tis from, I pardon little slips in Cler. Dom. Com. But let me tell you I'll not take his part, If ev'ry Thursday he date Die Mart. Of sputt'ring mortals, 'tis the fatal curse, By mending blunders still to make them worse. Men sneer when ? gets a lucky thought, And stare if Wyndham should be nodding caught. But sleeping's what the wisest men may do, Should the committee chance to sit till two. Not unlike paintings, principles appear, Some best at distance, some when we are near. The love of politicks so vulgar's grown, My landlord's party from his sign is known: Mark of French wine, see Ormond's head appear, While Marlb'rough's face directs to beer and beer; Some Buchanan's, the Pope's head some like best, The Devil tavern is a standing jest. Whoe'er you are that have a seat secure, Duly return'd, and from petition sure, Stick to your friends in whatsoe'er you say; With strong aversion shun the middle-way; The middle-way the best we sometimes call, But 'tis in politicks no way at all. A Trimmer's what both parties turn to sport, By country hated, and despis'd at court. Who would in earnest to a party come, Must give his vote not whimsical, but plumb. There is no medium; for the term in vogue, On either side is, honest man, or rogue. Can it be difficult our minds to shew, Where all the difference is, yes, or no? In all professions, time and pains give skill; Without hard study dare physicians kill? Can he that ne'er read statutes or reports, Give chamber counsel, or urge law in courts? But ev'ry whipster knows affairs of state, Nor fears on nicest subjects to debate. A knight of eighteen hundred pounds a year— Who minds his head, if his estate be clear? Sure he may speak his mind, and tell the house, He matters not the government a louse. Lack-learning knights, these things are safely said To friends in private, at the Bedford-head; But in the house, before your tongue runs on, Consult sir James, lord William's dead and gone. Words to recall is in no member's power, One single word may send you to the Tower. The wrong'd to help, the lawless to restrain, Thrice ev'ry year in ancient Egbert's reign, The members to the Mitchelgemot went, In after-ages called the Parliament; Early the Mitchelgemot did begin T'inroll their statutes on a parchment skin: For impious treason hence no room was left, For murder, for polygamy, or theft: Since when the senate's power both sexes know From hops and claret, soap and callico. Now wholsome laws young senators bring in 'Gainst goals, attorneys, bribery, and gin. Since such the nature of the British state, The power of parliament so old and great, Ye 'squires and Irish lords, 'tis worth your care To be return'd for city, town, or shire, By sheriff, bailiff, constable, or mayor. Some doubt, which to a seat has best pretence, A man of substance, or a man of sense: But never any member feats will do, Without a head-piece and a pocket too; Sense is requir'd the depth of things to reach, And money gives authority to speech. A man of bus'ness won't till ev'ning dine, Abstains from women, company, and wine: From Fig's new theatre he'll miss a night, Tho' cocks, and bulls, and Irish women fight: Nor sultry sun, nor storms of soaking rain, The man of bus'ness from the house detain: Nor speaks he for no reason but to say, I am a member, and I spoke to-day. I speak sometimes, you'll hear his lordship cry, Because some speak that have less sense than I. The man that has both land and money too, May wonders in a trading borough do: They'll praise his ven'son, and commend his port, Turn their two former members into sport, And, if he likes it, satirize the court. But at a feast 'tis difficult to know From real friends an undiscover'd foe; The man that swears he will the poll secure, And pawns his soul that your election's sure, Suspect that man: beware, all is not right, He's, ten to one, a corporation-bite. Alderman Pond, a downright honest man, Would say, I cannot help you, or I can: To spend your money, sir, is all a jest; Matters are settled, set your heart at rest: We've made a compromise, and, sir, you know, That sends one member high, and t'other low. But if his good advice you would not take, He'd scorn your supper, and your punch forsake, Leave you of mighty interest to brag, And poll two voices like sir Robert Fag. Parliamenteering is a sort of itch, That will too oft unwary knights bewitch. Two good estates sir Harry Clodpole spent; Sate thrice, but spoke not once, in parliament; Two good estates are gone—Who'll take his word? Oh! should his uncle die, he'd spend a third; He'd buy a house his happiness to crown, Within a mile of some good borough-town; Tag, rag, and bobtail to sir Harry's run, Men that have votes, and women that have none; Sons, daughters, grandsons, with his honour dine; He keeps a publick-house without a sign. Coblers and smiths extol th'ensuing choice, And drunken taylors boast their right of voice, Dearly the free-born neighbourhood is bought, They never leave him while he's worth a groat: So leeches stick, nor quit the bleeding wound, Till off they drop with skinfuls to the ground. THE MAN of TASTE. Occasion'd by an EPISTLE Of Mr. Pope's on that Subject. By the Same. Whoe'er he be that to a Taste aspires, Let him read this, and be what he desires. In men and manners vers'd from life I write, Not what was once, but what is now polite. Those who of courtly France have made the tour, Can scarce our English aukwardness endure. But honest men who never were abroad, Like England only, and its Taste applaud. Strife still subsists, which yields the better goût; Books or the world, the many or the few. True Taste to me is by this touchstone known, That's always best that's nearest to my own. To shew that my pretensions are not vain, My father was a play'r in Drury-lane, Pears and pistachio-nuts my mother sold, He a dramatick poet, she a scold. His tragic Muse could countesses affright, His wit in boxes was my lord's delight. No mercenary priest e'er join'd their hands, Uncramp'd by wedlock's unpoetick bands. Laws my Pindarick parents matter'd not, So I was tragi-comically got. My infant tears a sort of measure kept, I squall'd in distichs, and in triplets wept. No youth did I in education waste, Happy in an hereditary Taste. Writing ne'er cramp'd the sinews of my thumb, Nor barbarous birch e'er brush'd my tender bum. My guts ne'er suffer'd from a college cook, My name ne'er enter'd in a buttery-book. Grammar in vain the sons of Priscian teach, Good parts are better than eight parts of speech: Since these declin'd, those undeclin'd they call, I thank my stars, that I declin'd them all. To Greek or Latin tongues without pretence, I trust to mother wit and father sense. Nature's my guide, all sciences I scorn, Pains I abhor, I was a poet born. Yet is my goût for criticism such, I've got some French, and know a little Dutch. Huge commentators grace my learned shelves, Notes upon books out-do the books themselves. Criticks indeed are valuable men, But hyper-criticks are as good agen. Tho' Blackmore's works my soul with raptures fill, With notes by Bentley they'd be better still. The Boghouse-Miscellany's well design'd. To ease the body, and improve the mind. Swift's whims and jokes for my resentment call, For he displeases me that pleases all. Verse without rhyme I never could endure, Uncouth in numbers, and in sense obscure. To him as nature, when he ceas'd to see, Milton's an universal blank to me. Confirm'd and settled by the nation's voice, Rhyme is the poet's pride, and people's choice. Always upheld by national support, Of market, university, and court: Thomson, write blank; but know that for that reason, These lines shall live when thine are out of season. Rhyme binds and beautifies the poet's lays, As London ladies owe their shape to stays. Had Cibber's self the Careless Husband wrote, He for the laurel ne'er had had my vote: But for his epilogues and other plays, He thoroughly deserves the modern bays. It pleases me, that Pope unlaurell'd goes, While Cibber wears the bays for play-house prose: So Britain's monarch once uncover'd sate, While Bradshaw bully'd in a broad-brimm'd hat. Long live old Curl! he ne'er to publish fears The speeches, verses, and last will of peers. How oft has he a publick spirit shewn, And pleas'd our ears, regardless of his own? But to give merit due, though Curl's the fame, Are not his brother book-sellers the same? Can statutes keep the British press in awe, While that sells best, that's most against the law? Lives of dead play'rs my leisure hours beguile, And Sessions-papers tragedize my stile. 'Tis charming reading in Ophelia's life, So oft a mother, and not once a wife: She could with just propriety behave, Alive with peers, with monarchs in her grave: Her lot how oft have envious harlots wept, By prebends bury'd, and by generals kept. T'improve in morals Mandevil I read, And Tyndal's scruples are my settled creed. I travell'd early, and I soon saw through Religion all, ere I was twenty-two, Shame, pain, or poverty shall I endure, When ropes or opium can my ease procure? When money's gone, and I no debts can pay, Self-murder is an honourable way. As Pasaran directs I'd end my life, And kill myself, my daughter, and my wife. Burn but that Bible which the parson quotes, And men of spirit all shall cut their throats. But not to writings I confine my pen, I have a Taste for buildings, musick, men. Young travell'd coxcombs mighty knowledge boast, With superficial smattering at most. Not so my mind, unsatisfied with hints, Knows more than Budgel writes, or Roberts prints. I know the town, all houses I have seen, From High-Park corner down to Bednal-Green. Sure wretched Wren was taught by bungling Jones, To murder mortar, and disfigure stones! Who in Whitchall can symmetry discern? I reckon Covent-garden church a barn. Nor hate I less thy vile catheral, Paul! The choir's too big, the cupola's too small: Substantial walls and heavy roofs I like, 'Tis Vanbrug's structures that my fancy strike: Such noble ruins ev'ry pile wou'd make, I wish they'd tumble for the prospect sake. To lofty Chelsea, or to Greenwich dome, Soldiers and sailors all are welcom'd home. Her poor to palaces Britannia brings, St. James's hospital may serve for kings. Buildings so happily I understand, That for one house I'd mortgage all my land. Dorick, Ionick, shall not there be found, But it shall cast me threescore thousand pound. From out my honest workmen, I'll select A Bricklay'r, and proclaim him artichect; First bid him build me a stupendous dome, Which having finish'd, we set out for Rome; Take a week's view of Venice and the Brent, Stare round, see nothing, and come home content. I'll have my Villa too, a sweet abode, Its situation shall be London road: Pots o'er the door I'll place like Cits balconies, Which Bentley's Milton, Book 9. ver. 439. Bentley calls the Gardens of Adonis. I'll have my gardens in the fashion too, For what is beautiful that is not new? Fair four-legg'd temples, theatres that vye With all the angles of a Christmas-pye. Does it not merit the beholder's praise, What's high to sink? and what is low to raise? Slopes shall ascend where once a green-house stood, And in my horse-pond I will plant a wood. Let misers dread the hoarded gold to waste, Expence and alteration shews a Taste. In curious paintings I'm exceeding nice, And know their several beauties by their price. Auctions and sales I constantly attend, But chuse my pictures by a skilful friend. Originals and copies much the same. The picture's value is the painter's name. My Taste in sculpture from my choice is seen, I buy no statues that are not obscene. In spite of Addison and ancient Rome, Sir Cloudesly Shovel's is my fav'rite tomb. How oft have I with admiration stood, To view some city-magistrate in wood! I gaze with pleasure on a lord-mayor's head, Cast with propriety in gilded lead. Oh could I view through London as I pass, Some broad Sir Balaam in Corinthian brass: High on a pedestal, ye freemen, place His magisterial paunch and griping face; Letter'd and gilt, let him adorn Cheapside, And grant the tradesman, what a king's deny'd. Old coins and medals I collect, 'tis true, Sir Andrew has 'em, and I'll have 'em too. But among friends if I the truth might speak, I like the modern, and despise th'antique. Tho' in the drawers of my japan bureau, To lady Gripeall I the Cæsars shew, 'Tis equal to her ladyship or me, A copper Otho, or a Scotch baubeè. Without Italian, or without an ear, To Bononcini's musick I adhere: Musick has charms to sooth a savage breast, And therefore proper at a sheriff's feast. My soul has oft a secret pleasure found, In the harmonious bagpipe's lofty sound. Bagpipes for men, shrill German-flutes for boys, I'm English born, and love a grumbling noise. The stage should yield the solemn organ's note, And scripture tremble in the Eunuch's throat. Let Senesino sing, what David writ, And hallelujahs charm the pious pit. Eager in throngs the town to Hester came, And Oratorio was a lucky name. Thou, Heidegger! the English Taste hast found, And rul'st the mob of quality with sound. In Lent, if masquerades displease the town, Call e'm Ridotto's, and they still go down. Go on prince Phiz! to please the British Nation, Call thy next Masquerade a Convocation. Bears, lions, wolves, and elephants I breed, And Philosophical Transactions read. Next lodge I'll be Free-mason, nothing less, Unless I happen to be F. R. S. I have a palate, and (as yet) two ears, Fit company for porters or for peers. Of ev'ry useful knowledge I've a share, But my top talent is a bill of fare. Sir loins and rumps of beef offend my eyes, Pleas'd with frogs fricasseed, and coxcomb-pies. Dishes I chuse though little, yet genteel, Snails the first course, and peepers crown the meal. Pigs heads with hair on, much my fancy please, I love young colly-flow'rs if stew'd in cheese, And give ten guineas for a pint of peas. No tattling servants to my table come, My grace is silence, and my waiter dumb. Queer country-puts extol queen Bess's reign, And of lost hospitality complain. Say thou that dost thy father's table praise, Was there mahogena in former days? Oh! could a British barony be sold! I would bright honour buy with dazling gold. Could I the privilege of peer procure, The rich I'd bully, and oppress the poor. To give is wrong, but it is wronger still, On any terms to pay a tradesman's bill. I'd make the insolent mechanicks stay, And keep my ready money all for play. I'd try if any pleasure could be found, In tossing up for twenty-thousand pound. Had I whole counties, I to White's would go, And set land, woods, and rivers, at a throw. But should I meet with an unlucky run, And at a throw be gloriously undone; My debts of honour I'd discharge the first, Let all my lawful creditors be curs'd: My title would preserve me from arrest, And seizing hired horses is a jest. I'd walk the morning with an oaken stick, With gloves and hat, like my own footman, Dick. A footman I wou'd be, in outward show, In sense, and education, truly so. As for my head it should ambiguous wear At once a perriwig and its own hair. My hair I'd powder in the women's way, And dress and talk of dressing more than they. I'll please the maids of honour, if I can; Without black velvet breeches, what is man? I will my skill in button-holes display, And brag how oft I shift me every day. Shall I wear cloaths in aukward England made? And sweat in cloth, to help the woollen trade? In French embroid'ry and in Flanders lace I'll spend the income of a treasurer's place. Deard's bill for baubles shall to thousands mount, And I'd out-di'mond even the di'mond count. I would convince the world by tawdry cloaths That belles are less effeminate than beaux, And doctor Lamb should pare my lordship's toes. To boon companions I my time would give, With players, pimps, and parasites I'd live. I would with jockeys from Newmarket dine, And to rough-riders give my choicest wine; I would caress some stableman of note, And imitate his language and his coat. My ev'nings all I would with sharpers spend, And make the thief-catcher my bosom friend. In Fig the prize-fighter by day delight, And sup with Colley Cibber ev'ry night. Should I perchance be fashionably ill, I'll send for Misaubin, and take his pill. I should abhor, though in the utmost need, Arbuthnot, Hollins, Wigan, Lee, or Mead; But if I found that I grew worse and worse, I'd turn off Misaubin and take a nurse, How oft when eminent physicians fail, Do good old women's remedies prevail? When beauty's gone, and Chloe's struck with years, Eyes she can touch, or she can syringe ears. Of graduates I dislike the learned rout, And chuse a female doctor for the gout. Thus would I live, with no dull pedants curs'd, Sure, of all blockheads, scholars are the worst. Back to your universities, ye fools, And dangle arguments on strings in schools: Those schools which Universities they call, 'Twere well for England were there none at all. With ease that loss the nation might sustain, Supply'd by Goodman's fields and Drury-lane. Oxford and Cambridge are not worth one farthing, Compar'd to Haymarket and Covent-garden: Quit those, ye British youth, and follow these, Turn players all, and take your 'squires degrees. Boast not your incomes now, as heretofore, Ye book-learn'd seats! the theatres have more: Ye stiff-rump'd heads of colleges be dumb; A single Eunuch gets a larger sum. Have some of you three hundred by the year; Booth, Rich, and Cibber, twice three thousand clear. Should Oxford to her sister Cambridge join A year's rack-rent, and arbitrary fine: Thence not one winter's charge would be defray'd, For play-house, opera, ball, and masquerade. Glad I congratulate the judging age, The players are the world, the world the stage. I am a politician too, and hate Of any party, ministers of state: I'm for an Act, that he, who sev'n whole years Has serv'd his king and country, lose his ears. Thus from my birth I'm qualified you find, To give the laws of Taste to human kind. Mine are the gallant schemes of politesse, For books, and buildings, politicks, and dress. This is true Taste, and whoso likes it not, Is blockhead, coxcomb, puppy, fool, and sot. AN ESSAY ON CONVERSATION. By Benjamin Stillingfleet. Oderunt hilarem tristes, tristemque jocosi, Sedatum celeres, agilem gnavumque remissi. Hor. The art of converse, how to sooth the soul Of haughty man, his passions to controul, His pride at once to humble and to please, And join the dignity of life with ease, Be now my theme. O thou, whom Nature's hand Fram'd for this best, this delicate command, And taught when lisping, without reason's aid, At the same time to speak and to persuade, Wyndham, with diligence awhile attend, Nor scorn th'instructions of an older friend; Who when the world's great commerce shall have join'd The deep reflection, and the strengh of mind, To the bright talents of thy youthful state, In turn shall on thy better lessons wait. Whence comes it, that in every art we see Many can rise to a supreme degree; Yet in this art, for which all seem design'd By nature, scarcely one compleat we find? You'll say, perhaps, we think, we speak, we move, By the strong springs alone of selfish love: Yet among all the species, is there one, Whom with more caution than ourselves, we shun? What is it fills a puppet-show or court? Go none but for the profit or the sport? If so, why comes each soul fatigu'd away, And curses the dull puppets same dull play; Yet, unconvinc'd, is tempted still to go? 'Tis that we find at home our greatest foe. And reason good why solitude we flee; Can wants with self-sufficiency agree? Yet, such our inconsistency of mind, We court society, and hate mankind. With some we quarrel, for they're too sincere: With others, for they're close, reserv'd and queer: This is too learn'd, too prudent, or too wise; And that we for his ignorance despise: A voice perhaps our ear shall harshly strike, Then strait ev'n wit itself shall raise dislike; Our eye may by some feature be annoy'd, Behold at once a character destroy'd: One's so good-natur'd, he's beyond all bearing, He'll ridicule no friend, tho' out of hearing: Another warm'd with zeal, offends our eyes, Because he holds the mirror up to vice. No wonder then, since fancies wild as these Can move our spleen, that real faults displease. When Mævius, spite of dullness, will be bright, And teach Argyll to speak, and Swift to write; When Flavia entertains us with her dreams, And Macer with his no less airy schemes; When peevishness, and jealousy and pride, And int'rest that can brother hearts divide, In their imagin'd forms our eyesight hit, Of an old maid, a poet, peer or cit; Can then, you'll say, philosophy refrain, And check the torrent of each boiling vein? Yes. She can still do more; view passion's slave With mind serene, indulge him, and yet save. But self-conceit steps in, and with strict eye Scans every man, and every man awry; That reigning passion, which thro' every stage Of life, still haunts us with unceasing rage. No quality so mean, but what can raise Some drudging driveling candidate for praise; Ev'n in the wretch, who wretches can despise, Still self-conceit will find a time to rise. Quintus salutes you with forbidding face, And thinks he carries his excuse in lace: You ask, why Clodius bullies all he can? Clodius will tell you, he's a gentleman: Myrtilla struts and shudders half the year, With a round cap, that shews a fine turn'd ear: The lowest jest makes Delia laugh to death; Yet she's no fool, she has only handsome teeth. Ventoso lolls, and scorns all human kind From the gilt coach with four lac'd slaves behind; Does all this pomp and state proceed from merit? Mean thought! he deems it nobler to inherit: While Fopling from some title draws his pride, Meanless, or infamous, or misapply'd; Free-mason, rake or wit, 'tis just the same, The charm is hence, he has gain'd himself a name. Yet, spite of all the fools that pride has made, 'Tis not on man an useless burthen laid; Pride has ennobled some, and some disgrac'd; It hurts not in itself, but as 'tis plac'd; When right, its view knows none but virtue's bound; When wrong, it scarcely looks one inch around. Mark! with what care the fair one's critic eye Scans o'er her dress, nor let's a fault slip by; Each rebel hair must be reduc'd to place With tedious skill, and tortur'd into grace; Betty must o'er and o'er the pins dispose, 'Till into modish folds the drapery flows, And the whole frame is fitted to express The charms of decency and nakedness. Why all this art, this labour'd ornament; To captivate, you'll cry no doubt, 'tis meant. True. But let's wait upon this fair machine From the lone closet to the social scene; There view her loud, affected, scornful, sour, Paining all others, and herself still more. What means she, at one instant to disgrace, The labour of ten hours, her much-lov'd face? Why, 'tis the self-same passion gratify'd; The work is ruin'd, that was rais'd by pride. Yet of all tempers, it requires least pain, Could we but rule ourselves, to rule the vain. The prudent is by reason only sway'd, With him each sentence and each word is weigh'd; The gay and giddy can alone be caught By the quick lustre of a happy thought; The miser hates, unless he steals your pelf; The prodigal, unless you rob yourself; The lewd will shun you, if your wife prove chaste; The jealous, if a smile on his be cast; The steady or the whimsical will blame, Either, because you're not, or are the same; The peevish, sullen, shrewd, luxurious, rash, Will with your virtue, peace, or interest, clash; But mark the proud man's price, how very low! 'Tis but a civil speech, a smile, or bow. Ye who push'd on by noble ardour, aim In social life to gain immortal fame, Observe the various passions of mankind, General, peculiar, single or combin'd: How youth from manhood differs in its views, And how old age still other paths pursues; How zeal in Priscus nothing more than heats, In Codex burns, and ruins all it meets; How freedom now a lovely face shall wear, Now shock us in the likeness of a bear; How jealousy in some resembles hate, In others, seems but love grown delicate; How modesty is often pride refin'd, And virtue but the canker of the mind; How love of riches, grandeur, life, and fame, Wear different shapes, and yet are still the same. But not our passions only disagree, In taste is found as great variety: Sylvius is ravish'd when he hears a hound, His lady hates to death the odious sound: Yet both love music, tho' in different ways; He in a kennel, she at opera's. A florist shall, perhaps, not grudge some hours, To view the colours in a bed of flowers; Yet, shew him Titian's workmanship divine, He passes on, and only cries, 'tis fine. A rusty coin, an old worm-eaten post, The mouldy fragment of an author lost, A butterfly, an equipage, a star, A globe, a fine lac'd head, a china jar, A mistress, or a fashion, that is new, Have each their charms, tho' felt but by a few. Then study each man's passion and his taste, The first to soften, and indulge the last: Not like the wretch, who beats down virtue's fence, And deviates from the paths of common sense; Who daubs with fulsome flattery, blind and bold, The very weakness we with grief behold. Passions are common to the fool and wise, And all would hide them under art's disguise; For so avow'd, in others, is their shame, None hates them more, than he who has the same. But taste seems more peculiarly our own, And every man is fond to make his known; Proud of a mark he fancies is design'd By nature to advance him o'er his kind; And where he sees that character impress'd, With joy he hugs the favourite to his breast. But the main stress of all our cares must lie, To watch ourselves with strict and constant eye: To mark the working mind, when passion's course Begins to swell, and reason still has force; Or, if she's conquer'd by the stronger tide, Observe the moments when they first subside; For he who hopes a victory to win O'er other men, must with himself begin; Else like a town by mutiny oppress'd, He's ruin'd by the foe within his breast; And they alone, who in themselves oft view Man's image, know what method to pursue. All other creatures keep in beaten ways, Man only moves in an eternal maze: He lives and dies, not tam'd by cultivation, The wretch of reason, and the dupe of passion; Curious of knowing, yet too proud to learn; More prone to doubt, than anxious to discern: Tir'd with old doctrines, prejudic'd at new; Mistaking still the pleasing for the true; Foe to restraints approv'd by gen'ral voice, Yet to each fool-born mode a slave by choice: Of rest impatient, yet in love with ease; When most good-natur'd, aiming how to teaze: Disdaining by the vulgar to be aw'd, Yet never pleas'd but when the fools applaud: By turns severe, indulgent, humble, vain; A trifle serves to lose him or to gain. Then grant this trifle, yet his vices shun, Not like to Cato or to Alcibiades. Clinias' son: This for each humour every shape could take, Ev'n virtue's own, tho' not for virtue's sake; At Athens rakish, thoughtless, full of fire, Severe at Sparta, as a Chartreux fryar; In Thrace, a bully, drunken, rash, and rude; In Asia gay, effeminate and lewd; While the rough Roman, virtue's rigid friend, Cou'd not to save the cause he dy'd for bend: In him 'twas scarce an honour to be good, He more indulg'd a passion than subdu'd. See how the skilful lover spreads his toils, When eager in pursuit of beauty's spoils! Behold him bending at his idol's feet; Humble, not mean; disputing, and yet sweet; In rivalship not fierce, nor yet unmov'd; Without a rival studious to be lov'd; For ever fearful, tho' not always witty, And never giving cause for hate or pity: These are his arts, such arts as must prevail, When riches, birth, and beauty's self will fail: And what he does to gain a vulgar end, Shall we neglect, to make mankind our friend? Good sense and learning may esteem obtain; Humour and wit a laugh, if rightly ta'en: Fair virtue admiration may impart; But 'tis good-nature only wins the heart: It molds the body to an easy grace, And brightens every feature of the face: It smooths th'unpolish'd tongue with eloquence, And adds persuasion to the finest sense. Yet this, like every disposition, has Fixt bounds, o'er which it never ought to pass; When stretch'd too far, its honour dies away, Its merit sinks, and all its charms decay; Among the good it meets with no applause, And to its ruin the malicious draws, A slave to all, who force it, or entice, It falls by chance in virtue or in vice, 'Tis true, in pity for the poor it bleeds, It cloaths the naked, and the hungry feeds; It cheers the stranger, nay its foes defends, But then as oft it injures its best friends. Study with care Politeness, that must teach The modish forms of gesture and of speech: In vain Formality, with matron mien, And Pertness apes her with familiar grin: They against nature for applauses strain, Distort themselves, and give all others pain: She moves with easy, tho' with measur'd pace, And shews no part of study, but the grace. Yet ev'n by this man is but half refin'd, Unless philosophy subdues the mind: 'Tis but a varnish that is quickly tost, Whene'er the soul in passion's sea is lost. Wou'd you both please and be instructed too, Watch well the rage of shining to subdue; Hear every man upon his fav'rite theme, And ever be more knowing than you seem. The lowest genius will afford some light, Or give a hint that had escap'd your sight. Doubt, till he thinks you on conviction yield. And with fit questions let each pause be fill'd: And the most knowing will with pleasure grant, You're rather much reserv'd, than ignorant. The rays of wit gild wheresoe'er they strike, But are not therefore fit for all alike; They charm the lively, but the grave offend, And raise a foe as often as a friend; Like the resistless beams of blazing light, That cheer the strong, and pain the weakly sight. If a bright fancy therefore be your share, Let judgment watch it with a guardian's care; 'Tis like a torrent apt to overflow, Unless by constant government kept low; And ne'er inefficacious passes by, But overturns or gladens all that's nigh. Or else, like trees, when suffer'd wild to shoot, That put forth much, but all unripen'd fruit; It turns to affectation and grimace, As like to wit, as dullness is to grace. How hard soe'er it be to bridle wit, Yet mem'ry oft no less requires the bit: How many, hurried by its force away, For ever in the land of gossips stray? Usurp the province of the nurse to lull, Without her privilege for being dull? Tales upon tales they raise ten stories high, Without regard to use or symmetry: So R?, till his destin'd space is fill'd, Heaps bricks on bricks, and fancies 'tis to build. A story should, to please, at least seem true, Be à propos, well told, concise, and new: And whensoe'er it deviates from these rules, The wise will sleep, and leave applause to fools. But others, more intolerable yet, The waggeries, that they've said, or heard, repeat; Heavy by mem'ry made, and what's the worst, At second-hand, as often as at first. And can even patience hear, without disdain, The maiming register of sense once slain? While the dull features, big with archness, strive In vain, the forc'd half-smile to keep alive. Some know no joy like what a word can raise, Haul'd thro' a language's perplexing maze; Till on a mate, that seems t'agree, they light, Like man and wife, that still are opposite; Not lawyers at the bar play more with sense, When brought to the last trope of eloquence, Than they on ev'ry subject, great or small, At clubs, or councils, at a church, or ball; Then cry we rob them of their tributes due: Alas! how can we laugh and pity too? While others to extremes as wild will run, And with sour face anatomize a pun: When the brisk glass to freedom does intice, And rigid wisdom is a kind of vice. But let not such grave fops your laughter spoil; Ne'er frown where sense may innocently smile. Cramp not your language into logick rules, To rostrums leave the pedantry of schools; Nor let your learning always be discern'd, But chuse to seem judicious more than learn'd. Quote seldom, and then let it be, at least, Some fact that's prov'd, or thought that's well express'd. But lest, disguis'd, your eye it shou'd escape, Know, pedantry can put on ev'ry shape: For when we deviate into terms of art, Unless constrain'd, we act the pedant's part. Or if we're ever in the self-same key, No matter of what kind the subject be. From laws of nations down to laws of dress, For statesmen have their cant, and belles no less, As good hear B?y dictate on epistles, Or B?rm?n comment on the Grecian whistles; As old Obesus preach upon his belly, Or Phileunucha rant on Farinelli; Flirtilla read a lecture on a fan, Or W?d set forth the praise of Kouli-Kan. But above all things raillery decline, Nature but few does for that task design: 'Tis in the ablest hand a dang'rous tool, But never fails to wound the medling fool: For all must grant, it needs no common art To keep men patient, when we make them smart. Not wit alone, nor humour's self, will do, Without good-nature, and much prudence too, To judge aright of persons, place, and time; For taste decrees what's low, and what's sublime: And what might charm to-day, or o'er a glass, Perhaps at court, or next day, wou'd not pass. Then leave to low buffoons, by custom bred, And form'd by nature to be kick'd and fed, The vulgar and unenvied task, to hit All persons right or wrong with random wit. Our wise forefathers, born in sober days, Resign'd to fools the tart and witty phrase; The motley coat gave warning for the jest, Excus'd the wound, and sanctify'd the pest: But we from high to low all strive to sneer, Will all be wits, and not the livery wear. Of all the qualities that help to raise In men the universal voice of praise, Whether in pleasure or in use they end, There's none that can with modesty contend. 'Tis a transparent veil that helps the sight, And lets us look on merit with delight: In others, 'tis a kindly light, that seems To gild the worst defects with borrow'd beams. Yet, 'tis but little that its form be caught, Unless its origin be first in thought: Else rebel nature will reveal the cheat, And the whole work of art at once defeat. Hold forth upon yourself on no pretence, Unless invited, or in self-defence; The praise you take, altho' it be your due, Will be supected, if it come from you: For each man, by experience taught, can tell How strong a flatterer does within him dwell: And if to self-condemning you incline, In sober sadness, and without design, (For some will slyly arrogate a vice, That from excess of virtue takes its rise) The world cries out, why does he hither come? Let him do penance for his sins at home. No part of conduct asks for skill more nice, Tho' none more common, than to give advice: Misers themselves in this will not be saving, Unless their knowledge makes it worth the having. And where's the wonder, when we will obtrude An useless gift, it meets ingratitude? Shun then, unask'd, this arduous task to try; But if consulted, use sincerity; Too sacred is the welfare of a friend, To give it up for any selfish end. But use one caution, sift him o'er and o'er, To find if all be not resolv'd before, If such the case, in spight of all his art, Some word will give the soundings of his heart; And why should you a bootless freedom use, That serves him not, and may his friendship lose? Yet still on truth bestow this mark of love, Ne'er to commend the thing you can't approve. Sincerity has such resistless charms, She oft the fiercest of our foes disarms: No art she knows, in native whiteness dress'd, Her thoughts all pure, and therefore all express'd: She takes from error its deformity; And without her, all other virtues die. Bright source of goodness! to my aid descend, Watch o'er my heart, and all my words attend: If still thou deign to set thy foot below, Among a race quite polish'd into show, Oh! save me from the jilt's dissembling part, Who grants to all all favours, but her heart: Perverts the end of charming, for the fame; To fawn, her business; to deceive, her aim; She smiles on this man, tips the wink on that, Gives one a squeeze, another a kind pat; Now jogs a foot, now whispers in an ear; Here slips a letter, and there casts a leer; Till the kind thing, the company throughout, Distributes all its pretty self about; While all are pleas'd, and wretched soon or late, All but the wise, who see and shun the bait. Yet if, as complaisance requires to do, And rigid virtue sometimes will allow, You stretch the truth in favour of a friend, Be sure it ever aim at some good end; To cherish growing virtue, vice to shame, And turn to noble views the love of fame: And not, like fawning parasites, unaw'd By sense or truth, be ev'ry passion's bawd. Be rarely warm in censure, or in praise; Few men deserve our passion either ways: For half the world but floats 'twixt good and ill, As chance disposes objects, these the will: 'Tis but a see-saw game, where virtue now Mounts above vice, and then sinks down as low. Besides the wise still hold it for a rule, To trust that judgment most, that seems most cool: For all that rises to hyperbole, Proves that we err, at least in the degree. But if your temper to extremes should lead, Always upon th'indulging side exceed; For tho' to blame most lend a willing ear, Yet hatred ever will attend on fear: And when a neighbour's dwelling blazes out, The world will think 'tis time to look about. Let not the curious from your bosom steal Secrets, where Prudence ought to set her seal; Yet be so frank and plain, that at one view, In other things, each man may see you thro': For if the mask of policy you wear, The honest hate you, and the cunning fear. Wou'd you be well receiv'd where-e'er you go, Remember each man vanquish'd is a foe. Resist not, therefore, with your utmost might, But let the weakest think he's sometimes right; He, for each triumph you shall thus decline, Shall give ten opportunities to shine: He sees, since once you own'd him to excel, That 'tis his interest you should reason well; And tho' when roughly us'd, he's full of choler, As blust'ring B?y to a brother scholar, Yet by degrees, inure him to submit, He's tame, and in his mouth receives the bit. But chiefly against trifling contests guard, 'Tis here submission seems to man most hard: Nor imitate that resolute old fool Ctesipho., Who undertook to kick against his mule. But those who will not by instruction learn, How fatal trifles prove, let story warn. Panthus and Euclio, link'd by friendship's tie, Liv'd each for each, as each for each wou'd die; Like objects pleas'd them, and like objects pain'd; 'Twas but one soul that in two bodies reign'd. One night, as usual 'twas their nights to pass, They ply'd the cheerful, but still temp'rate glass, When lo! a doubt is rais'd about a word: A doubt that must be ended by the sword: One falls a victim, mark, O man, thy shame, Because their glossaries were not the same. Cou'd Ba?l?y's self more tenderness have shown For his two tomes of words, tho' half his own? For what remains of failings without end, Morals must some, and some the laws must mend. While others in such monstrous forms appear, As tongue-ty'd sourness, sly suspicion's leer, Free-fisted rudeness, dropsical pretence, Proteus' caprice, and elbowing insolence; No caution to avoid them they demand, Like wretches branded by the hangman's hand. If faith to some philosophers be given, Man, that great lord of earth, that heir of heav'n, Savage at first, inhabited the wood, And scrambled with his fellow-brutes for food; No social home he knew, no friendship's tie, Selfish in good, in ill without ally; Till some in length of time, of stronger nerve, And greater cunning, forc'd the rest to serve One common purpose, and, in nature's spite, Brought the whole jarring species to unite. But might we not with equal reason say, That ev'ry single particle of clay, Which forms our body, was at first design'd To lie for ever from the rest disjoin'd? Can this be said, and can it be allow'd 'Twas with its powers for no one end endow'd? If so; we own that man, at first, by art Was sooth'd to act in social life a part. 'Tis true, in some the seeds of discord seem To contradict this all-uniting scheme: But that no more hurts nature's general course, Than matter found with a repelling force. Turn we awhile on lonely man our eyes, And see what frantick scenes of folly rise: In some dark monastery's gloomy cells, Where formal self-presuming Virtue dwells, Bedoz'd with dreams of grace-distilling caves, Of holy puddles, unconsuming graves, Of animated plaister, wood, and stone, And mighty cures by sainted sinners done. Permit me, Muse, still farther to explore, And turn the leaves of superstition o'er; Where wonders upon wonders ever grow, Chaos of zeal and blindness, mirth and woe; St. Dominick, vide Jansenius (Nic.)Visions of devils into monkeys turn'd, That hot from hell roar at a finger burn'd; Of our Saviour and others, vide Ferrand.Bottles of precious tears that saints have wept, Of Joseph, vide Molinæum.And breath a thousand years in phials kept; St. Cathro's, vide Colganum.Sun-beams sent down to prop one friar's staff, St. Anthony.And hell broke loose to make another laugh; Vide life of St. Colman by Colganus.Obedient fleas, and The same life by the same author. superstitious mice; Vide speculum vitæ sancti Francisci.Confessing wolves, and St. Munnu gathered those that dropt from him, and put them in their place again, vide Act. Sanctorum. sanctifying lice; From St. Firman to St. Columba, vide Colganum. Chapel of Loretto.Letters and houses by an angel carried; Maria de la Visitation, vide her life by Lusignam.And, wondrous! virgin nuns to Jesus married. One monk, not knowing how to spend his time, Sits down to find out some unheard-of crime; Increases the large catalogue of sins, And where the sober finish, there begins. Of death eternal his decree is past, For the first crime, as fix'd as for the last. While that, as idle, and as pious too, Compounds with false religion for the true; He, courtly usher to the blest abodes, Weighs all the niceties of forms and modes; And makes the rugged paths so smooth and even, None but an ill-bred man can miss of heav'n. One heav'n-inspir'd invents a frock, or hood: The taylor now cuts out, and men grow good. Another quits his stockings, breeches, shirt, Because he fancies virtue dwells with dirt: While all concur to take away the stress From weightier points, and lay it on the less. Anxious each paltry relique to preserve Of him, whose hungry friends they leave to starve, Harrass'd by watchings, abstinence, and chains; Strangers to joys, familiar grown with pains; To all the means of virtue they attend With strictest care, and only miss the end. Can scripture teach us, or can sense persuade, That man for such employments e'er was made? Far be that thought! but let us now relate A character as opposite, as great, In him, who living gave to Athens fame, And, by his death, immortaliz'd her shame. Great scourge of sophists! he from heaven brought down, And plac'd true wisdom on th'usurper's throne: Philosopher in all things, but pretence; He taught what they neglected, common sense. They o'er the stiff Lyceum form'd to rule; He, o'er mankind; all Athens was his school. The sober tradesman, and smart petit-maitre, Great lords, and wits, in their own eyes still greater, With him grew wise; unknowing they were taught; He spoke like them, tho' not like them he thought: Nor wept, nor laugh'd, at man's perverted state; But left to women this, to ideots that. View him with sophists fam'd for fierce contest, Or crown'd with roses at the jovial feast; Insulted by a peevish, noisy wife, Or at the bar foredoom'd to lose his life; What moving words flow from his artless tongue, Sublime with ease, with condescension strong! Yet scorn'd to flatter vice, or virtue blame; Nor chang'd to please, but pleas'd because the same; The same by friends caress'd, by foes withstood, Still unaffected, cheerful, mild, and good. Behold one pagan, drawn in colours faint, Outshine ten thousand monks, tho' each a saint! Here let us fix our foot, hence take our view, And learn to try false merit by the true. We see, when reason stagnates in the brain, The dregs of fancy cloud its purest vein; But circulation betwixt mind and mind Extends its course, and renders it refin'd. When warm with youth we tread the flow'ry way, All nature charms, and ev'ry scene looks gay; Each object gratifies each sense in turn, Whilst now for rattles, now for nymphs we burn; Enslav'd by friendship's or by love's soft smile, We ne'er suspect, because we mean no guile: Till, flush'd with hope from views of past success, We lay on some main trifle all our stress; When lo! the mistress or the friend betrays, And the whole fancied cheat of life displays: Stun'd with an ill that from ourselves arose; For instinct rul'd, when reason should have chose; We fly for comfort to some lonely scene, Victims henceforth of dirt, and drink, and spleen. But let no obstacles that cross our views, Pervert our talents from their destin'd use; For, as upon life's hill we upwards press, Our views will be obstructed less and less. Be all false delicacy far away, Lest it from nature lead us quite astray; And for th'imagin'd vice of human race, Destroy our virtue, or our parts debase; Since God with reason joins to make us own, That 'tis not good for man to be alone. ODE, to a LADY. On the Death of Col. Charles Ross, in the Action at Fontenoy. Written May 1745. By Mr. W. Collins. I While, lost to all his former mirth, Britannia's genius bends to earth, And mourns the fatal day; While, stain'd with blood, he strives to tear Unseemly from his sea-green hair The wreaths of cheerful May; II The thoughts which musing pity pays, And fond remembrance loves to raise, Your faithful hours attend; Still fancy, to herself unkind, Awakes to grief the soften'd mind, And points the bleeding friend. III By rapid Scheld's descending wave His country's vows shall bless the grave, Where-e'er the youth is laid: That sacred spot the village hind With ev'ry sweetest turf shall bind, And peace protect the shade. IV O'er him, whose doom thy virtues grieve, Aërial forms shall sit at eve And bend the pensive head! And, fall'n to save his injur'd land, Imperial Honour's aweful hand Shall point his lonely bed! V The warlike dead of every age, Who fill the fair recording page, Shall leave their sainted rest: And, half-reclining on his spear, Each wond'ring Chief by turns appear, To hail the blooming guest. VI Old Edward's sons, unknown to yield, Shall crowd from Cressy's laurell'd field, And gaze with fix'd delight; Again for Britain's wrongs they feel, Again they snatch the gleamy steel, And wish th'avenging fight. VII If, weak to sooth so soft an heart, These pictur'd glories nought impart To dry thy constant tear; If yet in sorrow's distant eye, Expos'd and pale thou seest him lie, Wild war insulting near. VIII Where-e'er from time thou court'st relief, The Muse shall still with social grief Her gentle promise keep: Ev'n humble Harting's cottag'd vale Shall learn the sad repeated tale, And bid her shepherds weep. ODE, Written in the same Year. By the Same. How sleep the brave, who sink to rest, By all their country's wishes blest! When Spring with dewy fingers cold, Returns to deck their hallow'd mold, She there shall dress a sweeter sod, Than Fancy's feet have ever trod. By fairy hands their knell is rung, By formsunseen their dirge is sung; There Honour comes, a Pilgrim grey, To bless the turf that wraps their clay, And Freedom shall awhile repair, To dwell a weeping Hermit there! ODE to EVENING. By the Same. If aught of oaten stop, or pastoral song, May hope, chaste Eve to sooth thy modest ear, Like thy own solemn springs, Thy springs, and dying gales, O Nymph reserv'd, while now the bright-hair'd sun Sits on yon western tent, whose cloudy skirts With brede etherial wove, O'erhang his wavy bed: Now air is hush'd, save where the weak-ey'd bat, With short shrill shrieks flits by on leathern wing, Or where the beetle winds His small but sullen horn, As oft he rises 'midst the twilight path, Against the pilgrim borne in heedless hum. Now teach me, maid compos'd, To breathe some soften'd strain, Whose numbers stealing through thy dark'ning vale, May not unseemly with its stillness suit, As musing slow, I hail Thy genial lov'd return! For when thy folding star arising shews His paly circlet, at his warning lamp The fragrant Hours, and Elves Who slept in flow'rs the day, And many a Nymph who wreaths her brows with sedge, And sheds the fresh'ning dew, and lovelier still, The Pensive Pleasures sweet Prepare thy shadowy car. Then lead, calm Vot'ress, where some sheety lake Cheers the lone heath, or some time-hallow'd pile, Or up-land fallows grey Reflect its last cool gleam. But when chill blust'ring winds, or driving rain, Forbid my willing feet, be mine the hut, That from the mountain's side, Views wilds, and swelling floods, And hamlets brown, and dim-discover'd spires, And hears their simple bell, and marks o'er all Thy dewy fingers draw The gradual dusky veil. While Spring shall pour his show'rs, as oft he wont, And bathe thy breathing tresses, meekest Eve! While Summer loves to sport Beneath thy ling'ring light; While sallow Autumn fills thy lap with leaves; Or Winter yelling through the troublous air, Affrights thy shrinking train, And rudely rends thy robes; So long, sure-found beneath the Sylvan shed, Shall Fancy, Friendship, Science, rose-lip'd Health, Thy gentlest influence own, And hymn thy fav'rite name! VERSES written on a Blank Leaf, By Lord Lansdown, when he presented his Works to the Queen, 1732. A muse expiring, who with earliest voice, Made kings and queens, and beauty's charms her choice, Now on her death bed, the last homage pays, O Queen, to thee; accept her dying lays. So at th'approach of death the cygnet tries To warble one note more, and singing dies. Hail mighty Queen, whose powerful smiles alone Command obedience and secure the throne. Contending parties, and Plebeian rage, Had puzzled Loyalty for half an age: Conqu'ring our hearts you end the long dispute; All who have eyes confess you absolute; To Tory doctrines even Whigs resign, And in your person own the right divine. Thus sung the Muse, in her last moments fir'd With Carolina's praise, and then expir'd. ADVICE to a Lady in Autumn. Asses milk, half a pint, take at seven, or before; Then sleep for an hour or two, and no more. At nine stretch your arms, and oh! think when alone, There's no pleasure in bed.—Mary, bring me my gown: Slip on that ere you rise; let your caution be such; Keep all cold from your breast, there's already too much; Your pinners set right, your twitcher ty'd on, Your prayers at an end, and your breakfast quite done; Retire to some author, improving and gay, And with sense like your own, set your mind for the day, At twelve you may walk, for at this time o' the year, The sun like your wit, is as mild, as 'tis clear: But mark in the meadows the ruin of Time; Take the hint, and let life be improv'd in its prime. Return not in haste, nor of dressing take heed; For beauty, like yours, no assistance can need. With an appetite, thus, down to dinner you sit, Where the chief of the feast is the flow of your wit: Let this be indulg'd, and let laughter go round; As it pleases your mind, to your health 'twill redound. After dinner two glasses at least, I approve; Name the first to the king, and the last to your love: Thus cheerful with wisdom, with innocence gay, And calm with your joys gently glide thro' the day. The dews of the evening most carefully shun; Those tears of the sky for the loss of the sun. Then in chat, or at play, with a dance, or a song, Let the night, like the day, pass with pleasure along. All cares, but of love, banish far from your mind; And those you may end, when you please to be kind. On a Lady drinking the Bath-Waters. The gushing streams impetuous flow, In haste to Delia's lips to go, With equal haste and equal heat, Who would not rush those lips to meet? Bless'd envy'd streams, still greater bliss Attends your warm and liquid kiss. For from her lips your welcome tide Shall down her heaving bosom glide; There fill each swelling globe of love, And touch that heart I ne'er could move. From hence in soft meanders stray, And find at last the blissful way Which thought may paint, tho' verse mayn't say. Too happy rival dwell not there To rack my heart with jealous care, But quit the blest abode, tho' loth, And quickly passing, ease us both. VERSES written in a Lady's Sherlock upon Death. Mistaken fair, lay Sherlock by, His doctrine is deceiving; For whilst he teaches us to die, He cheats us of our living. To die's a lesson we shall know Too soon without a master; Then let us only study now How may we live the faster. To live's to love, to bless, be blest With mutual inclination; Share then my ardour in your breast, And kindly meet my passion. But if thus bless'd I may not live, And pity you deny, To me at least your Sherlock give, 'Tis I must learn to die. SONG. [When Fanny blooming fair] When Fanny blooming fair First caught my ravish'd sight, Struck with her shape and air, I felt a strange delight: Whilst eagerly I gaz'd, Admiring ev'ry part, And ev'ry feature prais'd, She stole into my heart. In her bewitching eyes Ten thousand loves appear; There Cupid basking lies, His shafts are hoarded there, Her blooming cheeks are dy'd With colour all their own, Excelling far the pride Of roses newly blown. Her well-turn'd limbs confess, The lucky hand of Jove; Her features all express The beauteous queen of love: What flames my nerves invade, When I behold the breast Of that too charming maid Rise, suing to be press'd! Venus round Fanny's waist, Has her own Cestus bound, With guardian Cupids grac'd, Who dance the circle round. How happy must he be, Who shall her zone unloose! That bliss to all, but me, May heaven and she refuse. SONG. [Whenever, Chloe, I begin] Whenever, Chloe, I begin Your heart like mine to move, You tell me of the crying sin Of unchaste lawless love. How can that passion be a sin, Which gave to Chloe birth? How can those joys but be divine, Which make a heaven on earth? To wed, mankind the priest trepann'd, By some sly fallacy, And disobey'd God's great command, Increase and multiply. You say that love's a crime; content: Yet this allow you must, More joy's in heav'n if one repent, Than over ninety just. Sin then, dear girl, for heaven's sake, Repent and be forgiven; Bless me, and by repentance make A holy day in heav'n.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. THE PROGRESS of LOVE. IN Four ECLOGUES. UNCERTAINTY. Eclogue I. To Mr. POPE. Pope, to whose reed beneath the beechen shade, The Nymphs of Thames a pleas'd attention paid; While yet thy Muse, content with humbler praise, Warbled in Windsor's grove her sylvan lays, Though now sublimely borne on Homer's wing, Of glorious wars, and godlike chiefs she sing: Wilt thou with me re-visit once again The crystal fountain, and the flow'ry plain? Wilt thou, indulgent, hear my verse relate The various changes of a lover's state; And while each turn of passion I pursue, Ask thy own heart if what I tell be true? To the green margin of a lonely wood, Whose pendent shades o'erlook'd a silver flood, Young Damon came, unknowing where he stray'd, Full of the image of his beauteous maid: His flock far off, unfed, untended lay, To ev'ry savage a defenceless prey; No sense of int'rest could their master move, And ev'ry care seem'd trifling now but Love. Awhile in pensive silence he remain'd, But tho' his voice was mute his looks complain'd; At length the thoughts within his bosom pent, Forc'd his unwilling tongue to give them vent. Ye Nymphs, he cry'd, ye Dryads, who so long Have favour'd Damon, and inspir'd his song; For whom, retir'd, I shun the gay resorts Of sportful cities, and of pompous courts; In vain I bid the restless world adieu, To seek tranquillity and peace with you. Tho' wild Ambition and destructive Rage, No Factions here can form, no Wars can wage; Tho' Envy frowns not on your humble shades, Nor Calumny your innocence invades, Yet cruel Love, that troubler of the breast, Too often violates your boasted rest; With inbred storms disturb your calm retreat, And taints with bitterness each rural sweet. Ah luckless day! when first with fond surprize On Delia's face I fix'd my eager eyes; Then in wild tumults all my soul was tost: Then reason, liberty, at once were lost: And ev'ry wish, and thought, and care was gone, But what my heart employ'd on her alone. Then too she smil'd: can smiles our peace destroy, Those lovely children of Content and Joy? How can soft pleasure and tormenting woe, From the same spring at the same moment flow? Unhappy boy, these vain enquiries cease, Thought could not guard, nor will restore thy peace: Indulge the frenzy that thou must endure, And sooth the pain thou know'st not how to cure. Come, flatt'ring Memory, and tell my heart How kind she was, and with what pleasing art She strove its fondest wishes to obtain, Confirm her pow'r, and faster bind my chain. If on the green we danc'd, a mirthful band, To me alone she gave her willing hand; Her partial taste, if e'er I touch'd the lyre, Still in my song found something to admire. By none but her my crook with flow'rs was crown'd, By none but her my brows with ivy bound: The world that Damon was her choice believ'd, The world, alas! like Damon, was deceiv'd! When last I saw her, and declar'd my fire In words as soft as passion cou'd inspire, Coldly she heard, and full of scorn withdrew, Without one pitying glance, or sweet adieu. The frighted hind, who sees his ripen'd corn Up from the roots by sudden tempests torn, Whose fairest hopes destroy'd and blasted lie, Feels not so keen a pang of grief as I. Ah, how have I deserv'd, inhuman maid, To have my faithful service thus repay'd? Were all the marks of kindness I receiv'd, But dreams of joy, that charm'd me and deceiv'd? Or did you only nurse my growing love, That with more pain I might your hatred prove? Sure guilty treachery no place cou'd find In such a gentle, such a gen'rous mind: A maid brought up the woods and wilds among, Could ne'er have learnt the art of courts so young: No; let me rather think her anger feign'd, Still let me hope my Delia may be gain'd; 'Twas only modesty that seem'd disdain, And her heart suffer'd when she gave me pain. Pleas'd with this flatt'ring thought the love-sick boy Felt the faint dawnings of a doubtful joy; Back to his flock more cheerful he return'd, When now the setting sun less fiercely burn'd: Blue vapours rose along the mazy rills, And light's last blushes ting'd the distant hills. HOPE. Eclogue II. To Mr. DODDINGTON. Hear, Doddington, the notes that shepherds sing, Notes soft as those of nightingales in spring: Nor Pan, nor Phœbus tune the shepherd's reed: From Love alone our tender lays proceed: Love warms our fancy with enliv'ning fires, Refines our genius, and our verse inspires: From him Theocritus, on Enna's plains, Learnt the wild sweetness of his Doric strains; Virgil by him was taught the moving art, That charm'd each ear, and soften'd ev'ry heart: O would'st thou quit the pride of courts, and deign To dwell with us upon the vocal plain, Thee too his pow'r should reach, and ev'ry shade Resound the praises of thy fav'rite maid; Thy pipe our rural concert wou'd improve, And we should learn of thee to please and love. Damon no longer sought the silent shade, No more in unfrequented paths he stray'd, But call'd the nymphs to hear his jocund song, And told his joy to all the rustic throng. Blest be the hour, he said, that happy hour, When first I own'd my Delia's gentle pow'r; Then gloomy Discontent and pining Care Forsook my breast, and left soft wishes there: Soft wishes there they left, and gay desires, Delightful languors, and transporting fires. Where yonder limes combine to form a shade, These eyes first gaz'd upon the charming maid; There she appear'd, on that auspicious day, When swains their sportive rites to Bacchus pay: She led the dance—heav'ns! with what grace she mov'd! Who cou'd have seen her then, and not have lov'd? I strove not to resist so sweet a flame, But glory'd in a happy captive's name; Nor wou'd I now, cou'd Love permit, be free, But leave to brutes their savage liberty. And art thou then, fond swain, secure of joy? Can no reverse thy flattering bliss destroy? Has treach'rous Love no torment yet in store? Or hast thou never prov'd his fatal pow'r? Whence flow'd those tears that late bedew'd thy cheek? Why sigh'd thy heart as if it strove to break? Why were the desart rocks invok'd to hear The plaintive accents of thy sad despair? From Delia's rigour all those pains arose, Delia, who now compassionates my woes, Who bids me hope; and in that charming word Has peace and transport to my soul restor'd. Begin, my pipe, begin the gladsome lay; A kiss from Delia shall thy musick pay; A kiss obtain'd 'twixt struggling and consent, Giv'n with forc'd anger, and disguis'd content: No laureat wreaths I ask to bind my brows, Such as the Muse on lofy bards bestows; Let other swains to praise or fame aspire: I from her lips my recompence require. Hark how the bees with murmurs fill the plain, While ev'ry flow'r of ev'ry sweet they drain: See, how beneath yon hillock's shady steep, The shelter'd herds on flow'ry couches sleep; Nor bees, nor herds, are half so blest as I, If with my fond desires my Love comply: From Delia's lips a sweeter honey flows, And on her bosom dwells more soft repose. Ah how, my dear, shall I deserve thy charms? What gift can bribe thee to my longing arms? A bird for thee in silken bands I hold, Whose yellow plumage shines like polish'd gold; From distant isles the lovely stranger came, And bears the Fortunate Canaries name; In all our woods none boasts so sweet a note, Not even the nightingale's melodious throat. Accept of this; and cou'd I add beside What wealth the rich Peruvian mountains hide; If all the gems in Eastern rocks were mine, On thee alone their glitt'ring pride shou'd shine. But if thy mind no gifts have pow'r to move, Phœbus himself shall leave th'Aonian grove; The tuneful Nine, who never sue in vain, Shall come sweet suppliants for their fav'rite swain. For him each blue-ey'd Naiad of the flood, For him each green-hair'd sister of the wood, Whom oft beneath fair Cynthia's gentle ray His musick calls to dance the night away. And you, fair nymphs, companions of my Love; With whom she joys the cowslip meads to rove, I beg you recommend my faithful flame, And let her often hear her shepherd's name; Shade all my faults from her enquiring sight, And shew my merits in the fairest light; My pipe your kind assistance shall repay, And ev'ry friend shall claim a diff'rent lay. But see! in yonder glade the heav'nly fair Enjoys the fragrance of the breezy air— Ah, thither let me fly with eager feet; Adieu, my pipe, I go my Love to meet— O may I find her as we parted last, And may each future hour be like the past! So shall the whitest lamb these pastures feed, Propitious Venus, on thy altars bleed. JEALOUSY. Eclogue III. To Mr. EDWARD WALPOLE. The gods, O Walpole, give no bliss sincere: Wealth is disturb'd by care, and pow'r by fear. Of all the passions that employ the mind, In gentle Love the sweetest joys we find; Yet e'en those joys dire Jealousy molests, And blackens each fair image in our breasts. O may the warmth of thy too tender heart Ne'er feel the sharpness of his venom'd dart; For thy own quiet think thy mistress just, And wisely take thy happiness on trust. Begin, my Muse, and Damon's woes rehearse, In wildest numbers and disorder'd verse. On a romantick mountain's airy head (While browzing goats at ease around him fed) Anxious he lay, with jealous cares oppress'd; Distrust and anger lab'ring in his breast— The vale beneath a pleasing prospect yields, Of verdant meads and cultivated fields; Through these a river rolls its winding flood, Adorn'd with various tufts of rising wood; Here half conceal'd in trees a cottage stands, A castle there the op'ning plain commands, Beyond, a town with glitt'ring spires is crown'd, And distant hills the wide horizon bound: So charming was the scene, awhile the swain Beheld delighted, and forgot his pain; But soon the stings infix'd within his heart, With cruel force renew'd their raging smart: His flow'ry wreath, which long with pride he wore. The gift of Delia, from his brows he tore: Then cry'd; May all thy charms, ungrateful maid, Like these neglected roses droop and fade; May angry Heav'n deform each guilty grace, That triumphs now in that deluding face; Those alter'd looks may ev'ry shepherd fly, And ev'n thy Daphnis hate thee worse than I. Say, thou inconstant, what has Damon done, To lose the heart his tedious pains had won; Tell me what charms you in my rival find, Against whose pow'r no ties have strength to bind; Has he, like me, with long obedience strove To conquer your disdain, and merit love? Has he with transport ev'ry smile ador'd, And dy'd with grief at each ungentle word? Ah, no! the conquest was obtain'd with ease: He pleas'd you, by not studying to please: His careless indolence your pride alarm'd; And had he lov'd you more, he less had charm'd. O pain to think, another shall possess Those balmy lips which I was wont to press: Another on her panting breast shall lie, And catch sweet madness from her swimming eye!— I saw their friendly flocks together feed, I saw them hand in hand walk o'er the mead; Wou'd my clos'd eyes had sunk in endless night, Ere I was doom'd to bear that hateful sight! Where-e'er they pass'd, be blasted every flow'r, And hungry wolves their helpless flocks devour.— Ah wretched swain, could no examples move Thy heedless heart to shun the rage of love? Hast thou not hear'd how poor See Mr. Gay's Dione. Menalcas dy'd A victim to Parthenia's fatal pride? Dear was the youth to all the tuneful plain, Lov'd by the nymphs, by Phœbus lov'd in vain: Around his tomb their tears the Muses paid, And all things mourn'd but the relentless maid. Wou'd I cou'd die like him and be at peace, These torments in the quiet grave would cease; There my vext thoughts a calm repose wou'd find, And rest as if my Delia still were kind. No, let me live her falshood to upbraid; Some god perhaps my just revenge will aid.— Alas what aid, fond swain, would'st thou receive? Cou'd thy heart bear to see its Delia grieve? Protect her, Heav'n, and let her never know The slightest part of hapless Damon's woe: I ask no vengeance from the pow'rs above; All I implore is never more to love— Let me this fondness from my bosom tear, Let me forget that e'er I thought her fair. Come, cool Indifference, and heal my breast; Wearied, at length, I seek thy downy rest: No turbulence of passion shall destroy My future ease with flatt'ring hopes of joy. Hear, mighty Pan, and all ye Sylvans hear, What by your guardian deities I swear; No more my eyes shall view her fatal charms, No more I'll court the trayt'ress to my arms; Not all her arts my steady soul shall move, And she shall find that Reason conquers Love.— Scarce had he spoke, when through the lawn below Alone he saw the beauteous Delia go; At once transported he forgot his vow, (Such perjuries the laughing gods allow) Down the steep hills with ardent haste he flew; He found her kind, and soon believ'd her true. POSSESSION. Eclogue IV. To the Lord COBHAM. Cobham, to thee this rural lay I bring, Whose guiding judgment gives me skill to sing; Though far unequal to those polish'd strains, With which thy Congreve charm'd the list'ning plains, Yet shall its musick please the partial ear, And sooth thy breast with thoughts that once were dear; Recall those years which time has thrown behind, When smiling Love with Honour shar'd thy mind: The sweet remembrance shall thy youth restore, Fancy again shall run past pleasures o'er, And while in Stowe's enchanting walks you stray, This theme may help to cheat the summer's day. Beneath the covert of a myrtle wood, To Venus rais'd a rustick altar stood, To Venus and to Hymen, there combin'd, In friendly league to favour humankind. With wanton Cupids in that happy shade, The gentle Virtues, and mild Wisdom play'd. Nor there in sprightly Pleasure's genial train, Lurk'd sick Disgust, or late repenting Pain, Nor Force, nor Int'rest, join'd unwilling hands, But Love consenting ty'd the blissful bands. Thither with glad devotion Damon came, To thank the pow'rs who bless'd his faithful flame; Two milk-white doves he on their altar laid, And thus to both his grateful homage paid: Hail, bounteous god, before whose hallow'd shrine My Delia vow'd to be for ever mine, While glowing in her cheeks, with tender love, Sweet virgin modesty reluctant strove: And hail to thee, fair queen of young desires; Long shall my heart preserve thy pleasing fires, Since Delia now can all its warmth return, As fondly languish, and as fiercely burn. O the dear gloom of last propitious night! O shade more charming than the fairest light! Then in my arms I clasp'd the melting maid, Then all my pains one moment overpaid; Then first the sweet excess of bliss I prov'd, Which none can taste but who like me have lov'd. Thou too, bright goddess, once in Ida's grove, Didst not disdain to meet a shepherd's love, With him while frisking lambs around you play'd, Conceal'd you sported in the secret shade; Scarce cou'd Anchises' raptures equal mine, And Delia's beauties only yield to thine. What are you now, my once most valu'd joys, Insipid trifles all, and childish toys— Friendship itself ne'er knew a charm like this, Nor Colin's talk could please like Delia's kiss. Ye Muses, skill'd in ev'ry winning art, Teach me more deeply to engage her heart; Ye Nymphs, to her your freshest roses bring, And crown her with the pride of all the spring; On all her days let health and peace attend; May she ne'er want, nor ever lose a friend; May some new pleasure ev'ry hour employ; But let her Damon be her highest joy. With thee, my Love, for ever will I stay, All night caress thee, and admire all day; In the same field our mingled flocks we'll feed, To the same spring our thirsty heifers lead, Together will we share the harvest toils, Together press the vine's autumnal spoils, Delightful state, where peace and love combine, To bid our tranquil days unclouded shine! Here limpid fountains roll through flow'ry meads, Here rising forests lift their verdant heads; Here let me wear my careless life away, And in thy arms insensibly decay. When late old age our heads shall silver o'er, And our slow pulses dance with joy no more; When time no longer will thy beauties spare, And only Damon's eye shall think thee fair; Then may the gentle hand of welcome death, At one soft stroke deprive us both of breath; May we beneath one common stone be laid, And the same cypress both our ashes shade. Perhaps some friendly Muse, in tender verse, Shall deign our faithful passion to rehearse, And future ages with just envy mov'd, Be told how Damon and his Delia lov'd. SOLILOQUY Of a BEAUTY in the Country. Written at Eton School. By the Same. 'Twas night; and Flavia to her room retir'd, With ev'ning chat and sober reading tir'd; There melancholy, pensive, and alone, She meditates on the forsaken town: On her rais'd arm reclin'd her drooping head, She sigh'd, and thus in plaintive accents said: “Ah, what avails it to be young and fair, “To move with negligence, to dress with care? “What worth have all the charms our pride can boast, “If all in envious solitude are lost? “Where none admire, 'tis useless to excel; “Where none are Beaus, 'tis vain to be a Belle: “Beauty, like wit, to judges should be shewn; “Both most are valu'd where they best are known. “With ev'ry grace of nature, or of art, “We cannot break one stubborn country heart: “The brutes, insensible, our pow'r defy: “To love exceeds a 'Squire's capacity. “The town, the court, is Beauty's proper sphere; “That is our heav'n, and we are angels There: “In that gay circle thousand Cupids rove, “The court of Britain is the court of Love. “How has my conscious heart with triumph glow'd, “How have my sparkling eyes their transport shew'd, “At each distinguish'd birth-night ball, to see “The homage due to empire, paid to me! “When ev'ry eye was fix'd on me alone, “And dreaded mine more than the monarch's frown: “When rival statesmen for my favour strove, “Less jealous in their pow'r, than in their love. “Chang'd is the scene; and all my glories die, “Like flow'rs transplanted to a colder sky; “Lost is the dear delight of giving pain, “The tyrant joy of hearing slaves complain. “In stupid indolence my life is spent, “Supinely calm, and dully innocent: “Unblest I wear my useless time away; “Sleep (wretched maid!) all night, and dream all day; “Go at set hours to dinner and to prayer; “For dulness ever must be regular. “Now with mamma at tedious whist I play; “Now without scandal drink insipid tea; “Or in the garden breathe the country air, “Secure from meeting any Tempter there: “From books to work, from work to books I rove, “And am (alas!) at leisure to improve! “Is this the life a Beauty ought to lead? “Were eyes so radiant only made to read? “These fingers, at whose touch ev'n age wou'd glow, “Are these of use for nothing but to sew? “Sure erring Nature never could design “To form a housewife in a mould like mine! “O Venus, queen and guardian of the fair, “Attend propitious to thy vot'ry's pray'r: “Let me revisit the dear town again: “Let me be seen!—cou'd I that wish obtain, “All other wishes my own pow'r would gain.

Parent of arts, whose skilful hand first taught The tow'ring pile to rise, and form'd the plan With fair proportion; architect divine, Minerva, thee to my advent'rous lyre Assistant I invoke, the means to sing Blenhemia, monument of British fame, Thy glorious work! for thou the lofty tow'rs Didst to his virtue raise, whom oft thy shield In peril guarded, and thy wisdom steer'd Through all the storms of war.—Thee too I call, Thalia, sylvan Muse, who lov'st to rove Along the shady paths and verdant bow'rs Of Woodstock's happy grove: there tuning sweet Thy rural pipe, while all the Dryad train Attentive listen; let thy warbling song Paint with melodious praise the pleasing scene, And equal these to Pindus' honour'd shades. When Europe freed, confess'd the saving pow'r Of Marlb'rough's hand; Britain who sent him forth Chief of confed'rate hosts, to fight the cause Of Liberty and Justice, grateful rais'd This palace sacred to her Leader's fame; A trophy of success; with spoils adorn'd Of conquer'd towns, and glorying in the name Of that auspicious field, where Churchill's sword Vanquish'd the might of Gallia, and chastis'd Rebel Bavar.—Majestick in its strength Stands the proud dome, and speaks its great design. Hail happy Chief, whose valour could deserve Reward so glorious! grateful nation hail, Who paid'st his service with so rich a meed! Which most shall I admire, which worthiest praise, The Hero or the People? Honour doubts, And weighs their virtues in an equal scale. Not thus Germania pays th'uncancell'd debt Of gratitude to us.—Blush, Cæsar, blush, When thou behold'st these tow'rs, ingrate to thee A monument of shame. Canst thou forget Whence they are nam'd, and what an English arm Did for thy throne that day? But we disdain Or to upbraid, or imitate thy guilt. Steel thy obdurate heart against the sense Of obligation infinite, and know, Britain, like Heav'n, protects a thankless world For her own glory, nor expects reward. Pleas'd with the noble theme, her task the Muse Pursues untir'd, and through the palace roves With ever-new delight. The tap'stry rich With gold, and gay with all the beauteous paint Of various-colour'd silks, dispos'd with skill, Attracts her curious eye. Here Ister rolls His purple wave; and there the Granic flood With passing squadrons foams: here hardy Gaul Flies from the sword of Britain; there to Greece Effeminate Persia yields.—In arms oppos'd Marlb'rough and Alexander vie for fame With glorious competition; equal both In valour and in fortune, but their praise Be diff'rent, for with diff'rent views they fought; This to subdue, and that to free mankind. Now through the stately portals issuing forth, The Muse to softer glories turns and seeks The woodland shade, delighted. Not the vale Of Tempé fam'd in song, or Ida's grove Such beauty boasts. Amid the mazy gloom Of this romantick wilderness once stood The bow'r of Rosamonda, hapless fair, Sacred to grief and love: the crystal fount In which she us'd to bathe her beauteous limbs Still warbling flows, pleas'd to reflect the face Of Spencer, lovely maid, when tir'd she sits Beside its flow'ry brink, and views those charms Which only Rosamond could once excel. But see where flowing with a nobler stream, A limpid lake of purest waters rolls Beneath the wide-stretch'd arch, stupendous work, Through which the Danube might collected pour His spacious urn! Silent awhile and smooth The current glides, till with an headlong force Broke and disorder'd, down the steep it falls In loud cascades; the silver-sparkling foam Glitters relucent in the dancing ray. In these retreats repos'd the mighty soul Of Churchill, from the toils of war and state, Splendidly private, and the tranquil joy Of contemplation felt, while Blenheim's dome Triumphal, ever in his mind renew'd The mem'ry of his fame, and sooth'd his thoughts With pleasing record of his glorious deeds. So by the rage of faction, home recall'd, Lucullus, while he wag'd successful war Against the pride of Asia, and the pow'r Of Mithridates, whose aspiring mind No losses could subdue, enrich'd with spoils Of conquer'd nations, back return'd to Rome, And in magnificent retirement past The evening of his life.—But not alone, In the calm shades of honourable ease, Great Marlb'rough peaceful dwelt: Indulgent heav'n Gave a companion to his softer hours, With whom conversing, he forgot all change Of fortune, or of taste, and in her mind Found greatness equal to his own, and lov'd Himself in her.—Thus each by each admir'd, In mutual honour, mutual fondness join'd: Like two fair stars with intermingled light, In friendly union they together shone, Aiding each other's brightness, till the cloud Of night eternal quench'd the beams of one. Thee Churchill first the ruthless hand of death Tore from thy consort's side, and call'd thee hence To the sublimer seats of joy and love; Where Fate again shall join her soul to thine, Who now, regardful of thy fame, erects The column to thy praise, and sooths her woe With pious honours to thy sacred name Immortal. Lo! where tow'ring on the height Of yon aërial pillar proudly stands Thy image, like a guardian god, sublime, And awes the subject plain: beneath his feet, The German eagles spread their wings, his hand Grasps Victory, its slave. Such was the brow Majestick, such thy martial port, when Gaul Fled from thy frown, and in the Danube sought A refuge from thy sword.—There, where the field Was deepest stain'd with gore, on Hochftet's plain, The theatre of thy glory, once was rais'd A meaner trophy, by th'Imperial hand; Extorted gratitude; which now the rage Of Malice impotent, beseeming ill A regal breast, has levell'd to the ground: Mean insult! this with better auspices Shall stand on British earth, to tell the world How Marlb'rough fought, for whom, and how repay'd His services. Nor shall the constant love Of her who rais'd the monument be lost In dark oblivion: That shall be the theme Of future bards in ages yet unborn, Inspir'd with Chaucer's fire, who in these groves First tun'd the British harp, and little deem'd His humble dwelling should the neighbour be Of Blenheim, house superb; to which the throng Of travellers approaching, shall not pass His roof unnoted, but respectful hail With rev'rence due. Such honour does the Muse Obtain her favourites.—But the noble pile (My theme) demands my voice.—O shade ador'd, Marlb'rough! who now above the starry sphere Dwell'st in the palaces of heav'n, enthron'd Amongst the demi-gods, deign to defend This thy abode, while present here below, And sacred still to thy immortal fame, With tutelary care. Preserve it safe From Time's destroying hand, and cruel stroke Of factious Envy's more relentless rage. Here may, long ages hence, the British youth, When Honour calls them to the field of war, Behold the trophies which thy valour rais'd; The proud reward of thy successful toils For Europe's freedom, and Britannia's fame: That fir'd with gen'rous envy, they may dare To emulate thy deeds.—So shall thy name, Dear to thy country, still inspire her sons With martial virtue: and to high attempts Excite their arms, till other battles won, And nations sav'd, new Monuments require, And other Blenheims shall adorn the land. TO THE Reverend Dr. AYSCOUGH at Oxford. Written from Paris in the Year 1728. By the Same. Say, dearest friend, how roll thy hours away? What pleasing study cheats the tedious day? Dost thou the sacred volumes oft explore Of wise Antiquity's immortal lore, Where virtue by the charms of wit refin'd, At once exalts and polishes the mind? How diff'rent from our modern guilty art, Which pleases only to corrupt the heart; Whose curs'd refinements odious Vice adorn, And teach to honour what we ought to scorn! Dost thou in sage Historians joy to see How Roman Greatness rose with Liberty; How the same hands that tyrants durst controul, Their empire stretch'd from Atlas to the Pole; Till wealth and conquest into slaves refin'd The proud luxurious masters of mankind? Dost thou in letter'd Greece each charm admire, Each grace, each virtue Freedom could inspire; Yet in her troubled states see all the woes And all the crimes that giddy Faction knows; Till rent by parties, by Corruption sold, Or weakly careless, or too rashly bold, She sunk beneath a mitigated doom, The slave and tut'ress of protecting Rome? Does calm Philosophy her aid impart, To guide the passions, and to mend the heart? Taught by her precepts, hast thou learnt the end To which alone the wise their studies bend; For which alone by nature were design'd The pow'rs of thought—to benefit mankind? Not like a cloyster'd drone, to read and doze, In undeserving, undeserv'd repose; But reason's influence to diffuse; to clear Th'enlighten'd world of ev'ry gloomy fear; Dispel the mists of error, and unbind Those pedant chains that clog the freeborn mind. Happy who thus his leisure can employ! He knows the purest hours of tranquil joy; Nor vex'd with pangs that busier bosoms tear, Nor lost to social Virtue's pleasing care; Safe in the port, yet lab'ring to sustain Those who will float on the tempestuous main. So Locke the days of studious quiet spent; So Boyle in wisdom found divine content; So Cambray, worthy of a happier doom, The virtuous slave of Louis and of Rome. Good Dr. Hough. Wor'ster thus supports his drooping age, Far from court-flatt'ry, far from party rage; He, who in youth a tyrant's frown defy'd, Firm and intrepid on his country's side, Her boldest champion then, and now hermildest guide. O gen'rous warmth! O sanctity divine! To emulate his worth, my friend, be thine: Learn from his life the duties of the gown; Learn not to flatter, nor insult the crown; Nor basely servile court the guilty great, Nor raise the Church a rival to the State: To Error mild, to Vice alone severe, Seek not to spread the law of Love by Fear. The priest, who plagues the world, can never mend: No foe to Man was e'er to God a friend: Let reason and let virtue faith maintain, All force but theirs is impious, weak, and vain. Me other cares in other climes engage, Cares that become my birth, and suit my age; In various knowledge to improve my youth, And conquer Prejudice, worst foe to Truth; By foreign arts domestick faults to mend, Enlarge my notions, and my views extend; The useful science of the world to know, Which books can never teach, or pedants shew. A nation here I pity, and admire, Whom noblest sentiments of glory fire, Yet taught by custom's force, and bigot fear, To serve with pride, and boast the yoke they bear: Whose Nobles born to cringe, and to command, In courts a mean, in camps a gen'rous band; From each low tool of pow'r content receive Those laws, their dreaded arms to Europe give. Whose people vain in want, in bondage blest, Though plunder'd, gay; industrious, though oppress'd; With happy follies rise above their fate, The jest and envy of each wiser state. Yet here the Muses deign'd awhile to sport In the short sun-shine of a fav'ring court: Here Boileau strong in sense, and sharp in wit, Who from the ancients, like the ancients writ, Permission gain'd inferior vice to blame, By flatt'ring incense to his Master's fame. Here Moliere, first of comick wits, excell'd Whate'er Athenian theatres beheld; By keen, yet decent satire skill'd to please, With morals mirth uniting, strength with ease. Now charm'd, I hear the bold Corneille inspire Heroick thought with Shakespear's force and fire; Now sweet Racine with milder influence move The soften'd heart to Pity and to Love. With mingled pain and pleasure I survey The pompous works of arbitrary sway; Proud palaces, that drain'd the subject store, Rais'd on the ruins of th'oppress'd and poor; Where ev'n mute walls are taught to flatter state, And painted triumphs stile Ambition Great The victories of Louis XVI. painted in the galleries of Versailles.. With more delight those pleasing shades I view, Where Condé from an envious court withdrew Chantilly.; Where, sick of glory, faction, pow'r and pride, (Sure judge how empty all, who all had try'd) Beneath his palms the weary Chief repos'd, And life's great scene in quiet Virtue clos'd. With shame that other fam'd retreat I see Adorn'd by Art, disgrac'd by Luxury St. Cloud.; Where Orleans wasted ev'ry vacant hour In the wild riot of unbounded pow'r. Where feverish Debauch and impious Love Stain'd the mad table and the guilty grove. With these amusements is thy friend detain'd; Pleas'd and instructed in a foreign land; Yet oft a tender wish recalls my mind From present joys to dearer left behind: O native isle, fair Freedom's happiest feat! At thought of thee my bounding pulses beat; At thought of thee my heart impatient burns, And all my country on my soul returns. When shall I see the fields, whose plenteous grain No pow'r can ravish from th'industrious swain? When kiss with pious love the sacred earth, That gave a Burleigh, or a Russel birth? When, in the shade of laws, that long have stood, Prop'd by their care, or strengthen'd by their blood, Of fearless independence wisely vain, The proudest slave of Bourbon's race disdain? Yet oh! what doubt, what sad presaging voice Whispers within, and bids me not rejoice; Bids me contemplate ev'ry state around, From sultry Spain to Norway's icy bound; Bids their lost rights, their ruin'd glories see; And tells me, These, like England, once were Free. To Mr. POYNTZ, Ambassador at the Congress of Soissons, in the Year 1728. Written at Paris. By the Same. O thou whose friendship is my joy and pride, Whose virtues warm me, and whose precepts guide; Thou, to whom greatness rightly understood, Is but a larger power of being good; Say, Poyntz, amidst the toils of anxious state, Does not thy secret soul desire retreat? Dost thou not wish (the task of glory done) Thy busy life at length might be thy own; That to thy lov'd Philosophy resign'd, No care might ruffle thy unbended mind? Just is the wish. For sure the happy meed, To favour'd man by smiling heav'n decreed, Is to reflect at ease on glorious pains, And calmly to enjoy what Virtue gains. Not him I praise, who from the world retir'd, By no enliv'ning gen'rous passion fir'd, On flow'ry couches slumbers life away, And gently bids his active pow'rs decay; Who fears bright Glory's awful face to see, And shuns Renown as much as Infamy. But blest is he, who exercis'd in cares, To private Leisure publick Virtue bears; Who tranquil ends the race he nobly run, And decks Repose with trophies Labour won. Him Honour follows to the secret shade, And crowns propitious his declining head: In his retreats their harps the Muses string, For him in lays unbought spontaneous sing; Friendship and Truth on all his moments wait, Pleas'd with Retirement better than with State; And round the bow'r where humbly great he lies, Fair olives bloom, or verdant laurels rise. So when thy Country shall no more demand The needful aid of thy sustaining hand; When Peace restor'd shall on her downy wing Secure Repose and careless Leisure bring; Then to the shades of learned ease retir'd, The world forgetting, by the world admir'd, Among thy books and friends, thou shalt possess Contemplative and quiet happiness; Pleas'd to review a life in honour spent, And painful merit paid with sweet content. Yet though thy hours unclogg'd with sorrow roll, Tho' wisdom calm, and science feed thy soul; One dearer bliss remains to be possess'd, That only can improve and crown the rest— Permit thy friend this secret to reveal, Which thy own heart perhaps would better tell; The point to which our sweetest passions move, Is to be truly lov'd, and fondly love. This is the charm that sooths the troubled breast, Friend to our health, and author of our rest, Bids every gloomy vexing passion fly, And tunes each jarring string to harmony. Ev'n while I write, the name of Love inspires More pleasing thoughts, and more enliv'ning fires; Beneath his pow'r my raptur'd fancy glows, And ev'ry tender verse more sweetly flows. Dull is the privilege of living free; Our hearts were never form'd for Liberty: Some beauteous image well imprinted there, Can best defend them from consuming care. In vain to groves and gardens we retire, And nature in her rural works admire; Tho' grateful these, yet these but faintly charm, They may Delight us, but can never Warm. May some fair eyes, my friend, thy bosom fire With pleasing pangs of ever gay desire; And teach thee that soft science, which alone Still to thy searching mind rests slightly known. Thy soul, though great, is tender and refin'd, To friendship sensible, to love inclin'd; And therefore long thou canst not arm thy breast Against the entrance of so sweet a guest. Hear what th'inspiring Muses bid me tell, For Heav'n shall ratify what they reveal. A chosen bride shall in thy arms be plac'd, With all attractive charms of beauty grac'd; Whose wit and virtue shall thy own express, Distinguish'd only by their softer dress: Thy greatness she, or thy retreat shall share, Sweeten tranquillity, or soften care: Her smiles the taste of ev'ry joy shall raise, And add new pleasure to renown and praise; Till charm'd you own the truth my verse would prove, That Happiness is near allied to Love. VERSES to be written under a Picture of Mr. POYNTZ. By the Same. Such is thy form, O Poyntz! but who shall find A hand, or colours, to express thy mind? A mind unmov'd by ev'ry vulgar fear, In a false world that dares to be sincere; Wise without art; without ambition great; Tho' firm, yet pliant; active, tho' sedate; With all the richest stores of Learning fraught, Yet better still by native Prudence taught; That, fond the griefs of the distress'd to heal, Can pity frailties it could never feel; That, when Misfortune su'd, ne'er sought to know What sect, what party, whether friend or foe; That, fix'd on equal Virtue's temp'rate laws, Despises calumny, and shuns applause; That, to its own perfections singly blind, Would for another think this praise design'd. An Epistle to Mr. POPE. From Rome, 1730. By the Same. Immortal bard! for whom each Muse has wove The fairest garlands of th'Aonian grove; Preserv'd, our drooping genius to restore, When Addison and Congreve are no more. After so many stars extinct in night The darken'd ages last remaining light! To thee from Latian realms this verse is writ, Inspir'd by memory of ancient wit; For now no more these climes their influence boast, Fall'n is their glory, and their virtue lost; From Tyrants and from Priests the Muses fly, Daughters of Reason and of Liberty: Nor Baiœ now, nor Umbria's plain they love, Nor on the banks of Var, or Mincius rove; To Thames's flow'ry borders they retire, And kindle in thy breast the Roman fire. So in the shades, where cheer'd with summer rays Melodious linnets warbled sprightly lays, Soon as the faded, falling leaves complain Of gloomy Winter's unauspicious reign, No tuneful voice is heard of joy or love, But mournful silence saddens all the grove. Unhappy Italy! whose alter'd state Has felt the worst severity of fate: Not that Barbarian hands her Fasces broke, And bow'd her haughty neck beneath their yoke; Not that her palaces to earth are thrown, Her cities desart, and her fields unsown; But that her ancient spirit is decay'd, That sacred Wisdom from her bounds is fled, That there the source of Science flows no more, Whence its rich streams supply'd the world before. Illustrious names! that once in Latium shin'd, Born to instruct and to command mankind; Chiefs, by whose virtue mighty Rome was rais'd, And Poets, who those Chiefs sublimely prais'd! Oft I the traces you have left explore, Your ashes visit, and your urns adore; Oft kiss, with lips devout, some mould'ring stone, With ivy's venerable shade o'ergrown; Those hallow'd ruins better pleas'd to see Than all the pomp of modern luxury. As late on Virgil's tomb fresh flow'rs I strow'd, While with th'inspiring Muse my bosom glow'd, Crown'd with eternal bays my ravish'd eyes Beheld the poet's aweful form arise; Stranger, he said, whose pious hand has paid These grateful rites to my attentive shade, When thou shalt breathe thy happy native air, To Pope this message from his Master bear: ‘Great Bard, whose numbers I myself inspire, To whom I gave my own harmonious lyre, If high exalted on the throne of Wit, Near me and Homer thou aspire to sit, No more let meaner Satire dim the rays That flow majestick from thy nobler bays; In all the flow'ry paths of Pindus stray, But shun that thorny, that unpleasing way; Nor when each soft engaging Muse is thine, Address the least attractive of the Nine. Of thee more worthy were the task, to raise A lasting column to thy Country's praise; To sing the land, which yet alone can boast That Liberty corrupted Rome has lost; Where Science in the arms of Peace is laid, And plants her Palm beside the Olive's shade. Such was the theme for which my lyre I strung, Such was the people whose exploits I sung; Brave, yet refin'd, for arms and arts renown'd, With diff'rent bays by Mars and Phœbus crown'd; Dauntless opposers of tyrannick sway, But pleas'd a mild Augustus to obey. If these commands submissive thou receive, Immortal and unblam'd thy name shall live; Envy to black Cocytus shall retire, And howl with Furies in tormenting fire; Approving Time shall consecrate thy lays, And join the Patriot's to the Poet's praise.’ To my Lord ? In the Year 1730. From Worcestershire. By the Same. Strenua nos exercet Inertia: Navibus atque Quadrigis petimus bene Vivere: quod petis hic est; Est Ulubris, Animus si te non deficit æquus. Horace. Fav'rite of Venus and the tuneful Nine, Pollio, by nature form'd in courts to shine, Wilt thou once more a kind attention lend To thy long absent and forgotten friend; Who after seas and mountains wander'd o'er, Return'd at length to his own native shore, From all that's gay retir'd, and all that's great, Beneath the shades of his paternal seat Has found that Happiness he sought in vain On the fam'd banks of Tiber and of Seine? 'Tis not to view the well-proportion'd pile, The charms of Titian's and of Raphael's stile; At soft Italian sounds to melt away; Or in the fragrant groves of myrtle stray; That lulls the tumults of the soul to rest, Or makes the fond possessor truly blest. In our own breasts the source of Pleasure lies Still open, and still flowing to the wise; Not forc'd by toilsome art and wild desire Beyond the bounds of nature to aspire, But in its proper channels gliding fair; A common benefit, which all may share, Yet half mankind this easy Good disdain, Nor relish happiness unbought by pain; False is their taste of bliss, and thence their search is vain. So idle, yet so restless are our minds, We climb the Alps, and brave the raging winds, Through various toils to seek Content we roam, Which but with thinking right were our's at home. For not the ceaseless change of shifted place Can from the heart a settled grief erase; Nor can the purer balm of foreign air Heal the distemper'd mind of aching care. The wretch by wild impatience driv'n to rove, Vex'd with the pangs of ill-requited love, From pole to pole the fatal arrow bears, Whose rooted point his bleeding bosom tears, With equal pain each diff'rent clime he tries, And is himself that torment which he flies. For how shou'd ills, that from our passions flow, Be chang'd by Afric's heat, or Russia's snow? Or how can aught but pow'rful Reason cure, What from unthinking Folly we endure? Happy is He, and He alone, who knows His heart's uneasy discord to compose; In gen'rous love of others' good to find The sweetest pleasures of the social mind; To bound his wishes in their proper sphere; To nourish pleasing hope, and conquer anxious fear, This was the wisdom ancient Sages taught, This was the sov'reign good they justly sought; This to no place or climate is confin'd, But the free native produce of the mind. Nor think, my Lord, that Courts to you deny The useful practice of Philosophy: Horace, the wisest of the tuneful choir, Not always chose from Greatness to retire, But in the palace of Augustus knew The same unnerring maxims to pursue, Which in the Sabine or the Velian shade His study and his happiness he made. May you, my friend, by his example taught, View all the giddy scene with sober thought; Undazzled every glittering folly see, And in the midst of slavish forms be free; In its own center keep your steddy mind; Let Prudence guide you, but let Honour bind; In show, in manners, act the Courtier's part, But be a Country-gentleman at heart. ADVICE to a LADY. By the Same. 1731. The counsels of a friend, Belinda, hear, Too roughly kind to please a Lady's ear, Unlike the flatt'ries of a lover's pen, Such truths as women seldom learn from men. Nor think I praise you ill, when thus I shew What female Vanity might fear to know: Some merit's mine, to dare to be sincere, But greater your's, sincerity to bear. Hard is the fortune that your sex attends; Women, like Princes, find few real friends: All who approach them their own ends pursue: Lovers and ministers are seldom true. Hence oft from Reason heedless Beauty strays, And the most trusted Guide the most betrays: Hence by fond dreams of fancy'd pow'r amus'd, When most you tyrannize you're most abus'd. What is your sex's earliest, latest care, Your heart's supreme ambition? To be fair: For this the toilet ev'ry thought employs, Hence all the toils of dress, and all the joys: For this, hands, lips, and eyes are put to school, And each instructive feature has its rule; And yet how few have learnt, when this is giv'n, Not to disgrace the partial boon of heav'n? How few with all their pride of form can move? How few are lovely, that were made for love? Do you, my fair, endeavour to possess An elegance of mind as well as dress; Be that your ornament, and know to please By grateful Nature's unaffected ease. Nor make to dang'rous Wit a vain pretence, But wisely rest content with modest Sense; For wit, like wine, intoxicates the brain, Too strong for feeble women to sustain; Of those who claim it, more than half have none, And half of those who have it, are undone. Be still superior to your sex's arts, Nor think Dishonesty a proof of Parts; For you the plainest is the wisest rule, A Cunning Woman is a Knavish Fool. Be good yourself, nor think another's shame Can raise your merit, or adorn your fame. Prudes rail at whores, as statesmen in disgrace At ministers, because they wish their place. Virtue is amiable, mild, serene, Without all beauty, and all peace within: The honour of a prude is rage and storm, 'Tis ugliness in its most frightful form: Fiercely it stands defying gods and men, As fiery monsters guard a giant's den. Seek to be good, but aim not to be great: A woman's noblest station is Retreat; Her fairest virtues fly from publick sight, Domestick worth, that shuns too strong a light. To rougher man Ambition's task resign: 'Tis ours in Senates or in Courts to shine, To labour for a sunk corrupted state, Or dare the rage of envy, and be great. One only care your gentle breasts should move, Th'important business of your life is Love: To this great point direct your constant aim, This makes your Happiness, and this your Fame. Be never cool reserve with passion join'd; With caution chuse; but then be fondly kind. The selfish heart, that but by halves is giv'n, Shall find no place in Love's delightful heav'n; Here sweet extremes alone can truly bless, The virtue of a lover is excess. A maid unask'd may own a well-plac'd flame, Not loving first, but loving wrong is shame. Contemn the little pride of giving pain, Nor think that conquest justifies disdain; Short is the period of insulting Pow'r; Offended Cupid finds his vengeful hour, Soon will resume the empire which he gave, And soon the Tyrant shall become the Slave. Blest is the maid, and worthy to be blest, Whose soul, entire by him she loves possess'd, Feels ev'ry vanity in fondness lost, And asks no pow'r, but that of pleasing most: Her's is the bliss in just return to prove The honest warmth of undissembled Love; For her, inconstant man might cease to range, And Gratitude forbid Desire to change. But lest harsh Care the lover's peace destroy, And roughly blight the tender buds of joy, Let Reason teach what Passion fain would hide, That Hymen's bands by Prudence should be ty'd. Venus in vain the wedded pair would crown, If angry Fortune on their union frown: Soon will the flatt'ring dream of bliss be o'er, And cloy'd imagination cheat no more. Then waking to the sense of lasting pain, With mutual tears the nuptial couch they stain; And that fond love, which should afford relief, Does but increase the anguish of their grief; While both could easier their own sorrows bear, Than the sad knowledge of each other's care. Yet may you rather feel that virtuous pain, Than sell your violated charms for gain; Than wed the wretch whom you despise, or hate, For the vain glare of useless wealth or state. The most abandoned prostitutes are they, Who not to Love, but Av'rice fall a prey: Nor aught avails the specious name of Wife; A maid so wedded, is a Whore for Life. Ev'n in the happiest choice, where fav'ring Heav'n Has equal love, and easy fortune giv'n, Think not, the husband gain'd, that all is done; The prize of Happiness must still be won; And oft, the careless find it to their cost, The Lover in the Husband may be lost; The Graces might alone his heart allure; They and the Virtues meeting must secure. Let ev'n your Prudence wear the pleasing dress Of care for him, and anxious tenderness. From kind concern about his weal or woe, Let each domestick duty seem to flow; The Houshold Sceptre, if he bids you bear, Make it your pride his servant to appear; Endearing thus the common acts of life, The Mistress still shall charm him in the Wife; And wrinkled age shall unobserv'd come on, Before his eye perceives one beauty gone: Ev'n o'er your cold, and ever-sacred urn, His constant flame shall unextinguish'd burn. Thus I, Belinda, would your charms improve, And form your heart to all the arts of Love; The task were harder to secure my own Against the pow'r of those already known; For well you twist the secret chains that bind With gentle force the captivated mind, Skill'd ev'ry soft attraction to employ, Each flatt'ring hope, and each alluring joy; I own your genius, and from you receive The rules of Pleasing, which to you I give. SONG. Written in the Year 1732. By the Same. [When Delia on the plain appears] I When Delia on the plain appears, Aw'd by a thousand tender fears, I would approach, but dare not move;— Tell me, my Heart, if this be Love. II Whene'er she speaks, my ravish'd ear No other voice but her's can hear, No other wit but her's approve;— Tell me, my Heart, if this be Love. III If she some other youth commend, Though I was once his fondest friend, His instant enemy I prove;— Tell me, my Heart, if this be Love. IV When she is absent, I no more Delight in all that pleas'd before, The clearest spring, or shadiest grove;— Tell me, my Heart, if this be Love. V When fond of pow'r, of beauty vain, Her nets she spreads for ev'ry swain, I strove to hate, but vainly strove;— Tell me, my Heart, if this be Love. SONG. Written in the Year 1733. By the Same. [The heavy hours are almost past] I The heavy hours are almost past That part my Love and me; My longing eyes may hope at last, Their only wish to see. II But how, my Delia, will you meet The man you've lost so long? Will Love in all your pulses beat, And tremble on your tongue? III Will you in every look declare Your heart is still the same? And heal each idly anxious care Our fears in absence frame? IV Thus, Delia, thus I paint the scene, When shortly we shall meet, And try what yet remains between Of loit'ring time to cheat. V But if the dream that sooths my mind Shall false and groundless prove; If I am doom'd at length to find You have forgot to love; VI All I of Venus ask, is this; No more to let us join; But grant me here the flatt'ring bliss, To Die and Think you mine. DAMON and DELIA. In Imitation of Horace and Lydia. Written in the Year 1732. By the same. Damon. Tell me, my Delia, tell me why My kindest, fondest looks you fly: What means this cloud upon your brow? Have I offended? tell me how? Some change has happen'd in your heart, Some rival there has stol'n a part; Reason these fears may disapprove: But yet I fear, because I love. Delia. First, tell me, Damon, why to-day At Belvidera's feet you lay? Why with such warmth her charms you prais'd, And ev'ry trifling beauty rais'd, As if you meant to let me see Your flatt'ry is not All for me? Alas! too well your sex I knew, Nor was so weak to think you true. Damon. Unkind! my falsehood to upbraid, When your own orders I obey'd; You bid me try by this deceit The notice of the world to cheat, And hide beneath another name The secret of our mutual flame. Delia. Damon, your prudence I confess, But let me wish it had been less; Too well the lover's part you play'd, With too much art your court you made; Had it been only art, your eyes Wou'd not have join'd in the disguise. Damon. Ah, cease thus idly to molest With groundless fears thy virgin breast. While thus at fancy'd wrongs you grieve, To me a real pain you give. Delia. Tho' well I might your truth distrust, My foolish heart believes you just; Reason this faith may disapprove, But I believe, because I love. ODE, in Imitation of Pastor Fido. Written Abroad in 1729. By the Same. (O Primavera Gioventu del Anno.) I Parent of blooming flow'rs and gay desires, Youth of the tender year, delightful Spring, At whose approach, inspir'd with equal fires, The am'rous Nightingale and Poet sing. II Again dost thou return, but not with thee Return the smiling hours I once possess'd; Blessings thou bring'st to others, but to me The sad remembrance, that I once was bless'd. III Thy faded charms, which Winter snatch'd away, Renew'd in all their former lustre shine; But ah! no more shall hapless I be gay, Or know the vernal joys that have been mine. IV Tho' linnets sing, tho' flow'rs adorn the green, Tho' on their wings soft zeyhyrs fragrance bear; Harsh is the musick, joyless is the scene, The odour faint; for Delia is not there. V Cheerless and cold I feel the genial sun, From thee while absent I in exile rove; Thy lovely presence, fairest light, alone Can warm my heart to gladness and to love. Part of an Elegy of Tibullus, translated. 1729–30. By the Same. (Divitias alius fulvo sibi congerat Auro.) Let others heap of wealth a shining store, And much possessing labour still for more; Let them, disquieted with dire alarms, Aspire to win a dang'rous fame in arms: Me tranquil poverty shall lull to rest, Humbly secure and indolently blest; Warm'd by the blaze of my own cheerful hearth, I'll waste the wintry hours in social mirth; In summer pleas'd attend to harvest toils, In autumn press the vineyard's purple spoils, And oft to Delia in my bosom bear Some kid, or lamb that wants its mother's care: With her I'll celebrate each gladsome day, When swains their sportive rites to Bacchus pay: With her new milk on Pales' altar pour, And deck with ripen'd fruits Pomona's bow'r. At night how soothing wou'd it be to hear, Shelter'd and warm, the tempest whistling near; And while my charmer in my arms I strain, Slumber assisted by the beating rain! Ah! how much happier, than the fool who braves In search of wealth the black tempestuous waves! While I, contented with my little store, In tedious voyage seek no distant shore, But idle lolling on some shady seat, Near cooling fountains shun the dog-star's heat; For what reward so rich cou'd Fortune give That I by absence shou'd my Delia grieve? Let great Messalla shine in martial toils, And grace his palace with triumphal spoils; Me beauty holds in strong, tho' gentle chains, Far from tumultuous war and dusty plains. With thee, my love, to pass my tranquil days, How would I slight ambition's painful praise! How would I joy with thee, my love, to yoke The ox, and feed my solitary flock! On thy soft breast might I but lean my head, How downy shou'd I think the woodland bed! The wretch who sleeps not by his fair one's side, Detests the gilded couch's useless pride, Nor knows his weary, weeping eyes to close, Tho' murm'ring rills invite him to repose. Hard was his heart, who thee, my fair, cou'd leave For all the honours prosp'rous War can give; Tho' through the vanquish'd east he spread his fame, And Parthian tyrants tremble at his name; Tho' bright in arms, while hosts around him bleed, With martial pride he press'd his foaming steed. No pomps like these my humble vows require; I ask, in thy embraces to expire: Thee may my closing eyes in death behold! Thee may my fault'ring hand yet strive to hold! Then, Delia, then thy heart will melt in woe, Then o'er my breathless clay thy tears will flow; Thy tears will flow, for gentle is thy mind, Nor dost thou think it weakness to be kind. With thee each youth and tender maid shall join In grief, and mix their friendly sighs with thine: But ah! my Delia, I conjure thee spare Thy heaving breasts and loose dishevell'd hair: Wound not thy form; lest on th'Elysian coast Thy anguish shou'd disturb my peaceful ghost. But now nor death, nor parting should employ Our sprightly thought, or damp our bridal joy: We'll live, my Delia, and from life remove All care, all bus'ness, but delightful Love. Old age in vain those pleasures wou'd retrieve, Which youth alone can taste, alone can give; Then let us snatch the moment to be blest, This hour is Love's—be Fortune's all the rest. SONG. Written in the Year 1732. By the Same. [Say, Myra, why is gentle Love] I Say, Myra, why is gentle Love A stranger to that mind, Which pity and esteem can move; Which can be just and kind? II Is it because you fear to share The ills that Love molest: The jealous Doubt, the tender Care, That rack the am'rous breast? III Alas! by some degree of woe We ev'ry bliss must gain: The heart can ne'er a transport know, That never feels a pain. Written at Mr. Pope's House at Twickenham, which he had lent to Mrs. G?lle. In August 1735. By the Same. I Go, Thames, and tell the busy town, Not all its wealth or pride Cou'd tempt me from the charms that crown That rural flow'ry side: II Thy flow'ry side, where Pope has plac'd The Muses' green retreat, With ev'ry smile of Nature grac'd, With ev'ry art compleat. III But now, sweet bard, thy heav'nly song Enchants us here no more; Their darling glory lost too long Thy once lov'd shades deplore. IV Yet still for beauteous G?lle's sake, The Muses here remain; G?lle, whose eyes have power to make A Pope of ev'ry swain. EPIGRAM. By the Same. [None without Hope e'er lov'd the brightest Fair] None without Hope e'er lov'd the brightest Fair, But Love can hope where Reason would despair. To Mr. West at Wickham. Written in the Year 1740. By the Same. Fair Nature's sweet simplicity With elegance refin'd, Well in thy Seat, my friend, I see, But better in my Mind. To both from courts and all their state Eager I fly, to prove Joys far above a courtier's fate, Tranquility and love. To Miss LUCY F? By the Same. Once by the Muse alone inspir'd, I sung my am'rous strains: No serious love my bosom fir'd; Yet ev'ry tender maid deceiv'd The idly mournful tale believ'd, And wept my fancy'd pains. But Venus now to punish me, For having feign'd so well, Has made my heart so fond of thee, That not the whole Aonian quire Can accents soft enough inspire, Its real flame to tell. To the Same, with Hammond's Elegies. All that of Love can be express'd In these soft numbers see; But, Lucy, would you know the rest, It must be read in me. To the Same. [To him who in an hour must die] To him who in an hour must die, Not swifter seems that hour to fly, Than slow the minutes seem to me, Which keep me from the sight of thee. Not more that trembling wretch would give Another day or year to live; Than I to shorten what remains Of that long hour which thee detains. Oh! come to my impatient arms, Oh! come with all thy heav'nly charms, At once to justify and pay The pain I feel from this delay. To the Same. [To ease my troubled mind of anxious care] I To ease my troubled mind of anxious care, Last night the secret casket I explor'd; Where all the letters of my absent fair, (His richest treasure) careful Love had stor'd: II In ev'ry word a magic spell I found Of pow'r to charm each busy thought to rest, Though ev'ry word increas'd the tender wound Of fond desire still throbbing in my breast. III So to his hoarded gold the miser steals, And loses ev'ry sorrow at the sight; Yet wishes still for more, nor ever feels Entire contentment, or secure delight. IV Ah! should I lose thee, my too lovely maid, Cou'dst thou forget thy heart was ever mine, Fear not thy letters shou'd the change upbraid: My hand each dear memorial shall resign: V Not one kind word shall in my pow'r remain A painful witness of reproach to thee; And lest my heart shou'd still their sense retain, My heart shall break, to leave thee wholly free. A Prayer to Venus in her Temple at Stowe. To the Same. I Fair Venus, whose delightful shrine surveys Its front reflected in the silver lake, These humble off'rings, which thy servant pays, Fresh flowers, and myrtle wreaths, propitious take. II If less my love exceeds all other love, Than Lucy's charms all other charms excel, Far from my breast each soothing hope remove, And there let sad despair for ever dwell. III But if my soul is fill'd with her alone, No other wish, nor other object knows, Oh! make her, Goddess, make her all my own, And give my trembling heart secure repose. IV No watchful spies I ask to guard her charms, No walls of brass, no steel-defended door; Place her but once within my circling arms, Love's surest fort, and I will doubt no more. To the Same. On her pleading want of Time. I On Thames's bank, a gentle youth For Lucy sigh'd with matchless truth, Ev'n when he sigh'd in rhyme; The lovely maid his flame return'd, And wou'd with equal warmth have burn'd, But that she had not Time. II Oft he repair'd with eager feet In secret shades this fair to meet Beneath th'accustom'd lyme; She would have fondly met him there, And heal'd with love each tender care, But that she had not Time. IV “It was not thus, inconstant maid, “You acted once (the shepherd said) “When love was in its prime: She griev'd to hear him thus complain, And would have writ to ease his pain, But that she had not Time. IV How can you act so cold a part? No crime of mine has chang'd your heart, If Love be not a crime.— We soon must part for months, for years— She would have answer'd with her tears, But that she had not Time. To the Same. [Your shape, your lips, your eyes are still the same] Your shape, your lips, your eyes are still the same, Still the bright object of my constant flame; But where is now the tender glance, that stole With gentle sweetness my enchanted soul? Kind fears, impatient wishes, soft desires, Each melting charm that love alone inspires. These, these are lost; and I behold no more The maid, my heart delighted to adore. Yet still unchang'd, still doating to excess, I ought but dare not try to love you less; Weakly I grieve, unpity'd I complain; But not unpunish'd shall your change remain; For you, cold maid, whom no complaints can move, Were far more blest, when you like me cou'd love. To the Same. [When I think on your truth, I doubt you no more] I When I think on your truth, I doubt you no more, I blame all the fears I gave way to before, I say to my heart, “Be at rest, and believe That whom once she has chosen she never will leave. II But ah! when I think on each ravishing grace That plays in the smiles of that heavenly face, My heart beats again; I again apprehend Some fortunate rival in every friend. III These painful suspicions you cannot remove, Since you neither can lessen your charms nor my love; But doubts caus'd by passion you never can blame; For they are not ill founded, or you feel the same. To the same with a New Watch. With me while present, may thy lovely eyes Be never turn'd upon this golden toy: Think ev'ry pleasing hour too swiftly flies, And measure time, by joy succeeding joy. But when the cares that interrupt our bliss To me not always will thy sight allow, Then oft with kind impatience look on this, Then every minute count—as I do now. An Irregular ODE written at Wickham, in 1746. To the Same. I. Ye sylvan scenes with artless beauty gay, Ye gentle shades of Wickham say, What is the charm that each successive year, Which sees me with my Lucy here, Can thus to my transported heart, A sense of joy unfelt before impart? II. Is it glad Summer's balmy breath that blows From the fair jess'mine, and the blushing rose? Her balmy breath, and all her blooming store, Of rural bliss was here before: Oft have I met her on the verdant side Of Norwood-hill, and in the yellow meads, Where Pan the dancing Graces leads, Array'd in all her flow'ry pride. No sweeter fragrance now the gardens yield, No brighter colours paint th'enamel'd field. III. Is it to Love these new delights I owe? Four times has the revolving sun His annual circle thro' the zodiac run; Since all that Love's indulgent pow'r On favour'd mortals can bestow, Was giv'n to me in this auspicious bow'r. IV. Here first my Lucy, sweet in virgin charms, Was yielded to my longing arms; And round our nuptial bed, Hov'ring with purple wings, th'Idalian boy Shook from his radiant torch the blissful fires Of innocent desires, While Venus scatter'd myrtles o'er her head. Whence then this strange increase of joy? He, only he can tell, who match'd like me, (If such another happy man there be) Has by his own experience try'd How much the Wife is dearer than the Bride. To the Memory of the same LADY, A MONODY. A. D. 1747. By the Same. Ipse cavâ solans ægrum testudine amorem, Te dulcis conjux, te solo in littore secum, Te veniente die, te decedente canebat. I. At length escap'd from ev'ry human eye, From ev'ry duty, ev'ry care, That in my mournful thoughts might claim a share, Or force my tears their flowing stream to dry, Beneath the gloom of this embow'ring shade, This lone retreat, for tender sorrow made, I now may give my burden'd heart relief, And pour forth all my stores of grief, Of grief surpassing ev'ry other woe, Far as the purest bliss, the happiest love Can on th'ennobled mind bestow, Exceeds the vulgar joys that move Our gross desires, inelegant, and low. II. Ye tufted groves, ye gently-falling rills, Ye high o'ershadowing hills, Ye lawns gay-smiling with eternal green, Oft have you my Lucy seen! But never shall you now behold her more: Nor will she now with fond delight And taste refin'd your rural charms explore. Clos'd are those beauteous eyes in endless night, Those beauteous eyes where beaming us'd to shine Reason's pure light, and Virtue's spark divine. III. Oft would the Dryads of these woods rejoice To hear her heav'nly voice, For her despising, when she deign'd to sing, The sweetest songsters of the spring: The woodlark and the linnet pleas'd no more; The nightingale was mute, And ev'ry shepherd's flute Was cast in silent scorn away, While all attended to her sweeter lay. Ye larks and linnets now resume your song, And thou, melodious Philomel, Again thy plaintive story tell. For death has stopt that tuneful tongue, Whose musick could alone your warbling notes excel. IV. In vain I look around O'er all the well-known ground My Lucy's wonted footsteps to descry; Where oft we us'd to walk, Where oft in tender talk We saw the summer sun go down the sky: Nor by yon fountain's side, Nor where its waters glide Along the valley, can she now be found: In all the wide-stretch'd prospect's ample bound No more my mournful eye Can aught of her espy, But the sad sacred earth where her dear relicks lie. V. O shades of H?y, where is now your boast? Your bright inhabitant is lost. You she preferr'd to all the gay resorts Where female vanity might wish to shine, The pomp of cities, and the pride of courts. Her modest beauties shun'd the publick eye: To your sequester'd dales And flow'r-embroider'd vales From an admiring world she chose to fly; With Nature there retir'd, and Nature's God, The silent paths of wisdom trod, And banish'd every passion from her breast, But those, the gentlest and the best, Whose holy flames with energy divine The virtuous heat enliven and improve, The conjugal, and the maternal love. VI. Sweet babes, who, like the little playful fawns, Were wont to trip along these verdant lawns By your delighted Mother's side, Who now your infant steps shall guide? Ah! where is now the hand whose tender care To ev'ry Virtue would have form'd your Youth, And strew'd with flow'rs the thorny ways of Truth? O loss beyond repair! O wretched Father left alone To weep their dire misfortune, and thy own! How shall thy weaken'd mind, oppress'd with woe, And drooping o'er thy Lucy's grave, Perform the duties that you doubly owe, Now she, alas! is gone, From folly, and from vice, their helpless age to save? VII. Where were ye, Muses, when relentless Fate From these fond arms your fair disciple tore, From these fond arms that vainly strove With hapless ineffectual Love To guard her bosom from the mortal blow? Could not your fav'ring power, Aonian maids, Could not, alas! your pow'r prolong her date, For whom so oft in these inspiring shades, Or under Campden's moss-clad mountains hoar, You open'd all your sacred store, Whate'er your ancient sages taught, Your ancient bards sublimely thought, And bade her raptur'd breast with all your spirit glow? VIII. Nor then did Pindus' or Castalia's plain, Or Aganippe's fount your steps detain, Nor in the Thespian vallies did you play; Nor then on The Mincio runs by Mantua, the birth-place of Virgil. Mincio's bank Beset with osiers dank, Nor where The Clitumnus is a river of Umbria, the residence of Propertius. Clitumnus rolls his gentle stream, Nor where through hanging woods Steep The Anio runs through Tibur or Tivoli, where Horace had a villa. Anio pours his floods, Nor yet where The Meles is a river of Ionia, from whence Homer, supposed to be born on its banks, is called Melisigenes. Meles, or The Ilissus is a river at Athens. Ilissus stray, Ill does it now beseem, That, of your guardian care bereft, To dire disease and death your darling should be left. IX. Now what avails it that in early bloom, When light fantastic toys Are all her sex's joys, With you she search'd the wit of Greece and Rome? And all that in her latter days To emulate her ancient praise Italia's happy genius could produce; Or what the Gallic fire Bright-sparkling could inspire, By all the Graces temper'd and refin'd; Or what in Britain's isle, Most favour'd with your smile, The pow'rs of reason and of fancy join'd To full perfection have conspir'd to raise? Ah what is now the use Of all these treasures that enrich'd her mind, To black oblivion's gloom for ever now consign'd? X. At least, ye Nine, her spotless name 'Tis yours from death to save, And in the temple of immortal Fame With golden characters her worth engrave. Come then, ye virgin sisters, come, And strew with choicest flow'rs her hallow'd tomb. But foremost thou, in sable vestment clad, With accents sweet and sad, Thou, plaintive Muse, whom o'er his Laura's urn Unhappy Petrarch call'd to mourn, O come, and to this fairer Laura pay A more impassion'd tear, a more pathetick lay. XI. Tell how each beauty of her mind and face Was brighten'd by some sweet, peculiar grace! How eloquent in ev'ry look Thro' her expressive eyes her soul distinctly spoke! Tell how her manners by the world refin'd Left all the taint of modish vice behind, And made each charm of polish'd courts agree With candid Truth's simplicity, And uncorrupted Innocence! Tell how to more than manly sense She join'd the soft'ning influence Of more than female tenderness: How in the thoughtless days of wealth and joy, Which oft the care of others' good destroy, Her kindly-melting heart, To ev'ry want, and ev'ry woe, To guilt itself when in distress The balm of pity would impart, And all relief that bounty could bestow! Ev'n for the kid or lamb that pour'd its life Beneath the bloody knife, Her gentle tears would fall, Tears from sweet Virtue's source, benevolent to all. XII. Not only good and kind, But strong and elevated was her mind: A spirit that with noble pride Could look superior down On Fortune's smile, or frown; That could without regret or pain To virtue's lowest duty sacrifice Or int'rest's or ambition's highest prize; That injur'd or offended never try'd Its dignity by vengeance to maintain, But by magnanimous disdain, A wit that temperately bright, With inoffensive light All pleasing shone, nor ever past The decent bounds that Wisdom's sober hand, And sweet Benevolence's mild command, And bashful Modesty before it cast. A prudence undeceiving, undeceiv'd, That nor too little, nor too much believ'd, That scorn'd unjust Suspicion's coward fear, And without weakness knew to be sincere. Such Lucy was, when in her fairest days Amidst th'acclaim of universal praise, In life's and glory's freshest bloom Death came remorseless on, and sunk her to the tomb. XIII. So where the silent streams of Liris glide, In the soft bosom of Campania's vale, When now the wintry tempests all are fled, And genial Summer breathes her gentle gale, The verdant orange lifts its beauteous head: From ev'ry branch the balmy flow'rets rise, On ev'ry bough the golden fruits are seen; With odours sweet it fills the smiling skies, The wood-nymphs tend it, and th'Idalian queen: But in the midst of all its blooming pride A sudden blast from Apenninus blows, Cold with perpetual snows: The tender blighted plant shrinks up its leaves, and dies. XIV. Arise, O Petrarch, from th'Elysian bowers, With never-fading myrtles twin'd, And fragrant with ambrosial flowers, Where to thy Laura thou again art join'd; Arise, and hither bring the silver lyre, Tun'd by thy skilful hand, To the soft notes of elegant desire, With which o'er many a land Was spread the fame of thy disastrous love; To me resign the vocal shell, And teach my sorrows to relate Their melancholy tale so well, As may ev'n things inanimate, Rough mountain oaks, and desart rocks, to pity move. XV. What were, alas! thy woes compar'd to mine? To thee thy mistress in the blissful band Of Hymen never gave her hand; The joys of wedded love were never thine. In thy domestic care She never bore a share, Nor with endearing art Would heal thy wounded heart Of ev'ry secret grief that fester'd there: Nor did her fond affection on the bed Of sickness watch thee, and thy languid head Whole nights on her unwearied arm sustain, And charm away the sense of pain: Nor did she crown your mutual flame With pledges dear, and with a father's tender name. XVI. O best of wives! O dearer far to me That when thy virgin charms Were yielded to my arms, How can my soul endure the loss of thee? How in the world to me a desart grown, Abandon'd, and alone, Without my sweet companion can I live? Without thy lovely smile, The dear reward of ev'ry virtuous toil, What pleasures now can pall'd Ambition give? Ev'n the delightful sense of well-earn'd praise, Unshar'd by thee, no more my lifeless thoughts could raise. XVII. For my distracted mind What succour can I find? On whom for consolation shall I call? Support me ev'ry friend, Your kind assistance lend To bear the weight of this oppressive woe. Alas! each friend of mine, My dear departed love, so much was thine, That none has any comfort to bestow. My books, the best relief In ev'ry other grief, Are now with your idea sadden'd all: Each fav'rite author we together read My tortur'd mem'ry wounds, and speaks of Lucy dead. XVIII. We were the happiest pair of human kind! The rolling year its varying course perform'd, And back return'd again, Another and another smiling came, And saw our happiness unchang'd remain; Still in her golden chain Harmonious Concord did our wishes bind: Our studies, pleasures, taste, the same. O fatal, fatal stroke, That all this pleasing fabrick Love had rais'd Of rare felicity, On which ev'n wanton Vice with envy gaz'd, And ev'ry scheme of bliss our hearts had form'd, With soothing hope, for many a future day, In one sad moment broke! Yet, O my soul, thy rising murmurs stay, Nor dare th'all-wise Disposer to arraign, Or against his supreme decree With impious grief complain. That all thy full-blown joys at once should fade Was his most righteous will, and be that will obey'd. XIX. Would thy fond love his grace to her controul, And in these low abodes of sin and pain Her pure exalted soul Unjustly for thy partial good detain? No—rather strive thy grov'ling mind to raise Up to that unclouded blaze, That heav'nly radiance of eternal light, In which enthron'd she now with pity sees How frail, how insecure, how slight Is ev'ry mortal bliss, Ev'n love itself, if rising by degrees Beyond the bounds of this imperfect state, Whose fleeting joys so soon must end, It does not to its sov'reign Good ascend. Rise then, my soul, with hope elate, And seek those regions of serene delight, Whose peaceful path and ever open gate No feet but those of harden'd Guilt shall miss. There Death himself thy Lucy shall restore, There yield up all his pow'r e'er to divide you more. VERSES Making Part of an EPITAPH on the same LADY. By the Same. Made to engage all hearts, and charm all eyes: Tho' meek, magnanimous; tho' witty, wise; Polite, as all her life in courts had been; Yet good, as she the world had never seen; The noble fire of an exalted mind, With gentle female tenderness combin'd. Her Speech was the melodious voice of Love, Her Song the warbling of the vernal Grove; Her Eloquence was sweeter than her Song, Soft as her Heart, and as her Reason strong; Her Form each beauty of her mind express'd. Her Mind was Virtue by the Graces dress'd. ON THE ABUSE of TRAVELLING. A CANTO, In Imitation of SPENSER. By GILBERT WEST, Esq; The ARGUMENT. Archimage tempts the Red-Cross Knight From love of Fairy-land, With show of foreign pleasures all, The which he doth withstand. I Wise was that Spartan Law-giver of old, Who rais'd on Virtue's base his well-built state, Exiling from her walls barbaric gold, With all the mischiefs that upon it wait, Corruption, luxury, and envious hate; And the distinctions proud of rich and poor, Which among brethren kindle foul debate, And teach Ambition, that to Fame would soar, To the false lure of wealth her stooping wing to low'r. II Yet would Corruption soon have entrance found, And all his boasted schemes eftsoon decay'd, Had not he cast a pow'rful circle round, Which to a distance the arch felon fray'd, And ineffectual his foul engines made: This was, to weet, that politic command, Which from vain travel the young Spartan stay'd, Ne suffer'd him forsake his native land, To learn deceitful arts, and science contraband. III Yet had the ancient world her courts and schools; Great Kings and Courtiers civil and refin'd; Great Rabbins, deeply read in Wisdom's rules, And all the arts that cultivate the mind, Embellish life, and polish human kind. Such, Asia, birth-place of proud monarchy, Such, elder Ægypt, in thy kingdoms shin'd, Mysterious Ægypt, the rank nursery Of superstitions fond, and learned vanity. IV But what accomplishments, what arts polite, Did the young Spartan want his deeds to grace, Whose manly virtues, and heroic spright, Check'd by no thought impure, no falsehood base, With nat'ral dignity might well out-face The glare of manners false, and mimic pride And wherefore should they range from place to place, Who to their country's love so firm were ty'd, All homely as she was, that for her oft they dy'd? V And Truth. sooth it is (with rev'rence may ye hear, And honour due to passion so refin'd) The strong affection which true patriots bear To their dear country, zealous is and blind, And fond as is the love of womankind, So that they may not her defects espy, No other rival, or one to compare with her. paragone may ever find, But gazing on her with an aweful eye And superstitious zeal, her learn to deify. VI And, like as is the faith unsound, untrue, Of him, who wand'ring aye from fair to fair, Conceiveth from each object passion new, Or from his heart quite drives the troublous care; So with the patriot-lover doth it fare, Who through the world delighting aye to rove, His country changeth with each change of air, Or weening the delights of all to prove, On none, or all alike bestows his vagrant love. VII moreover, besides.Als doth corruption in a distant soil, With double force assault. assay the youthful heart, Expos'd suspectless to the traytor's wile, Expos'd unwarn'd to Pleasure's poison'd dart, Expos'd unpractis'd in the world's wide mart, Where each one lies, imposes, and betrays, Without a friend due counsel to impart, Without a parent's awe to rule his ways, Without the check of shame, or spur of public praise. VIII therefore.Forthy, false Archimago, traytor vile, Who burnt 'gainst Fairy-land with ceaseless ire, 'Gan cast with foreign pleasures to beguile Her faithful knight, and quench the heav'nly fire That did his virtuous bosom aye inspire With zeal unfeigned for her service true, And send him forth in chivalrous attire, Arm'd at all points adventures to pursue, And wreak upon her foes his vowed vengeance due. IX So as he journeyed upon the way, Him soon the sly enchaunter overtook. over-hent, Clad like a Fairy knight in armour gay, With painted shield, and spear right forward bent, In knightly fashion. guise and shew of courage. hardiment, That aye prepared was for bloody fight. Whereat the fairy. Elfin knight with speeches gent Him first saluted, who, well as he might, Him fair salutes again, as beseemeth. seemeth courteous knight. X Then 'gan he discourse, or argument. purpose frame of valiant deeds Atchiev'd by foreign knights of might, valour. prowess great, And mighty fame which emulation breeds In virtuous breast, and kindleth martial heat; Of arts and sciences for warriour proper, fit. meet, And knights that would in feats of arms excel, Or him, who rather. liefer choosing calm retreat, With Peace and gentle Virtue aye would dwell, Who have their triumphs, like as hath Bellona fell. XI These, as he said, beseemed knight to know, And all be they in Fairy-lond y-taught, Where ev'ry art and all fair virtues grow; Yet various climes with various fruits are fraught, And such in one hath full perfection reach'd. raught The which no skill may in another rear, So gloz'd th'enchaunter till he hath him brought To a huge rock, that clomb so high in air, That from it he hardly. uneath the murmuring surge mote hear, XII Thence the salt wave beyond in prospect wide A spacious plain the false enchaunter show'd, With goodly castles deck'd on ev'ry side, And silver streams, that down the champain flow'd, And wash'd the vineyards that beside them stood, And groves of myrtle; als the lamp of day His orient beams display'd withouten cloud, Which lightly on the glist'ning waters play, And tinge the castles, woods, and hills with purple ray. XIII So fair a landscape charm'd the wond'ring knight; And eke the breath of morning fresh and sweet Inspir'd his jocund spirit with delight, And ease of heart for soft pursuasion meet. Then him the traytor base 'gan fair entreat, And from the rock as downward they descend, Of that blest lond his praises 'gan repeat, Till he him moved hath with him to to go. wend; So to the billowy shore their hasty march they bend. XIV There in a painted bark all trim and gay, Whose sails full glad embrac'd the wanton wind, There sat a stranger man or woman. wight in quaint array, That seem'd of various garbs together. attone combin'd, Of Europe, Afric, east and western Inde. Als round about him many creatures stood, Of several nations and of divers kind, Apes, serpents, birds with human speech endow'd, And monsters of the land, and wonders of the flood. XV He was to weet a mighty traveller, Who Curiosity thereafter was called. hight, And well he knew each coast and harbour fair, And ev'ry nation's latitude and site, And how to steer the wand'ring bark aright. So to him strait the false enchaunter bore, And with him likewise brought the red-cross knight: Then fairly him besought to waft them o'er; Swift flew the dauncing bark, and reach'd the adverse shore. XVI There when they landed were, them ran to greet A bevy of bright damsels gent and gay, Who with soft smiles, and salutation sweet, And courteous violence would force them stay, And rest them in their bow'r not far away; Their bow'r that most luxuriously was adorned, set forth. dight With all the dainties of air, earth and sea, All that mote please the taste, and charm the sight, The pleasure of the board, and charm of beauty bright. XVII Als might he therein hear a mingled sound Of feast and song and laughing jollity, That in the noise was all distinction drown'd Of graver sense, or musick's harmony. Yet were there some in that blithe company That aptly could discourse of virtuous lore, Of manners, wisdom and sound policy; Yet would not. nould they often ope their sacred store, Ne might their voice be heard mid riot and uproar. XVIII Thereto the joys of idleness and love, And luxury, that besots the noblest mind, And custom prevalent at distance drove All sense and relish of a higher kind, Whereby the soul to virtue is refin'd. Instead whereof the arts of slavery Were taught, of slavery perverse and blind, That vainly boasts her native liberty, Yet wears the chains of pride, of lust, and gluttony. XIX Of which the red-cross knight right well aware, Would in no wise agree with them to go, Albeit with courtly glee their leader fair, called.Hight Politessa, him did kindly woo. But all was false pretence, and hollow show, False as the flow'rs which to their breasts they ty'd, Or those which seemed in their cheeks to glow, For both were false, and not by Nature dy'd, False rivals of the spring, and beauty's rosy pride. XX Then from behind then straightway 'gan advance An uncouth stripling quaintly habited, As for some revel mask, or antick daunce, All chequer'd o'er with yellow, blue, and red; Als in a vizor black he shrouds his head, The which he tossed to and fro amain, And often. eft his lathy falchion brandished, As if he meant fierce battle to attempt. darrain, And like a wanton ape eft skip'd he on the plain. XXI And eft about him skip'd a gaudy throng Of youthful gallants, frolick, trim, and gay, Chanting in careless notes their amourous song, Match'd with like careless gests, like amourous play. Als were they gorgeous, dress'd in rich array, And well accepted of that female train, Whose hearts to joy and mirth devoted aye, Each proffer'd love receive without disdain, And part without regret from each late-favour'd swain. XXII And now they do accord in wanton daunce To join their hands upon the flow'ry plain; The whiles with amourous leer and eyes askaunce Each damsel fires with love her glowing swain; Till all-impatient of the tickling pain, In sudden laughter forth at once they break, And ending so their daunce, each tender twain To shady bow'rs forthwith themselves betake, Deep hid in myrtle groves, beside a silver lake. XXIII Thereat the red-cross knight was much enmov'd, And 'gan his heart with indignation swell, To view in forms so made to be belov'd, Ne faith, ne truth, ne heav'nly virtue dwell; But lust instead, and falshood, child of hell; And glutton sloth, and love of gay attire: And sooth to say, them well could parallel Their lusty lovers. paramours in vain desire; Well fitted to each dame was ev'ry gallant squire. XXIV Yet when their sov'reign calls them forth to arms, Their sov'reign, whose commands. behests they most revere, Right wisely can they menage war's alarms, And wield with valour great the martial spear, So that their name is dreaded far and near. Oh! that for Liberty they so did fight! Then need no Fairy-land their prowess fear, Ne give in charge to her advent'rous knight Their friendship to beware, and sense-deluding sleight. XXV But not for liberty they wagen war, But solely to please. aggrate their mighty lord, For whom their dearest blood they will not. nillen spare, Whenso him listeth draw the conqu'ring sword; So is that idol vain of them ador'd, Who ne with might beyond his meanest thrall Endued, ne superior wisdom stor'd, Sees at his feet prostrated millions fall, And with religious drad obey his princely call. XXVI Thereto so high and stately was his port, That all the petty kings him sore envy'd, And would him imitate in any sort, With all the mimick pageantry of pride, And worship'd be like him, and deify'd Of courtly sycophants and scoundrels. caitifs vile, Who to those services themselves apply'd, And in that school of servitude ere while Had learn'd to bow and grin, and flatter, and beguile. XXVII For to that seminary of fashions vain The rich and noble from all parts repair, Where grown enamour'd of the gaudy train, And courteous haviour gent and debonair, They cast to imitate such semblaunce fair; And deeming meanly of their native lond, Their own rough virtues they disdain to wear, And back returning drest by foreign hond, Ne other matter care, ne other understond. XXVIII Wherefore th'enchaunter vile, who sore was griev'd To see the knight reject those damsels gay, Wherewith he thought him sure to have deceiv'd, Was minded to that court him to convey, And daze his eyen with Majesty's bright ray: So to a stately castle he him brought, Which in the midst of a great garden lay, And wisely was by cunning craftsmen wrought, And with all riches deck'd surpassing human thought. XXIX There underneath a sumptuous canopy, That with bright ore and diamonds glitter'd far, Sate the swoln form of royal pride. surquedry, And deem'd itself by all means; omnino. allgates some creature rare, While its own haughty state it mote compare With the base count'nance of the vassal fry, That seem'd to have nor eye, nor tongue, nor ear; Ne any sense, ne any faculty, That did not to his throne owe servile ministry. XXX Yet wist he not that half that homage low Was at a wizard's shrine in private pay'd, The which conducted all that goodly show, And as he list th'imperial puppet play'd, By secret springs and wheels right wisely made, That he the subtle wires mote not discover, perceive. avize, But deem in sooth that all he did or said, From his own motion and free grace did rise, And that he justly hight immortal, great, and wise. XXXI And eke to each of that same gilded train, That meekly round that lordly throne did stand, Was by that wizard ty'd a magick chain, Whereby their actions all he mote command, And rule with hidden influence the land. Yet to his lord he outwardly did bend, And those same magick chains within his hand Did seem to place, albeit by the end He held them fast, that none them from his gripe mote rend. XXXII He was to weet an old and wrinkled mage, Deep read in all the arts of policy, And from experience grown so crafty sage, That none his secret counsels mote descry, Ne search the mines of his deep subtlety. Thereto fair peace he lov'd and cherished; And traffick did promote and industry, Whereby the vulgar were in quiet fed, And the proud lords in ease and plenty wallowed. XXXIII Thence all the gorgeous splendor of the court, since.Sith the sole bus'ness of the rich and great, Was to that hope-built temple to resort, And round their earthly god in glory wait, Who with their pride to swell his royal state, Did pour large sums of gold on ev'ry one, Brought him by harpies fell, him to aggrate, And torn from peasants vile, beneath the throne Who lay deep sunk in earth, and inwardly did groan. XXXIV Behold, says Archimage, the envy'd height Of human grandeur to the gods ally'd! Behold yon sun of pow'r, whose glorious light, O'er this rejoicing land out-beaming wide, Calls up those princely flow'rs on ev'ry side; Which like the painted daughters of the plain, Ne toil, ne spin, ne stain their silken pride With care, or sorrow, sith withouten pain, Them in eternal joy those heav'nly beams maintain. XXXV Them morn and evening joy eternal greets, And for them thousands and ten thousands work hard. moil, Gathering from land and ocean honied sweets For them, who in soft indolence the while And slumb'ring peace enjoy the luscious spoil; And as they view around the careful bees quite spent.Forespent with labour and incessant toil, With the sweet contrast learn themselves to please, And heighten by compare the luxury of ease. XXXVI Ungenerous man, quoth then the Fairy knight, That can rejoice to see another's woe! And thou, unworthy of that glory bright, Wherewith the gods have deck'd thy princely brow, That doth on Sloth and Gluttony bestow The hard-earn'd fruits of Industry and Pain, And to the dogs the labourer's morsel throw, Unmindful of the hand that sow'd the grain, The poor earth-trodden root of all thy greatness vain. XXXVII Oh foul abuse of sacred Majesty, That boasteth her fair self from heav'n ysprong! Where are the marks of thy divinity? Truth, Mercy, Justice steady, bold and strong, To aid the meek, and curb oppressive wrong? Where is the care and love of publick good, That to the people's father doth belong? Where the vice-gerent of that bounteous God, Who bids dispense to all, what he for all bestow'd? XXXVIII Dwell'st thou not rather, like the prince of hell, In Pandemonium full of ugly fiends? Dissimulation, Discord, Malice fell, Reckless Ambition, that right onward goes. wends, Tho' his wild march o'erthrow both fame and friends, And virtue and his country; crooked Guile, Obliquely creeping to his treach'rous ends, And Flatt'ry, curs'd assassin, who the while He holds the murd'rous knife, can fawn, and kiss, and smile. XXXIX Then 'gan he strait unvail the mirrour bright, The which fair Una in Spenser represents Truth, see B. 1. Fairy Queen. Una gave him heretofore, Ere he as yet, with Heathen, the usual enemy of knight-errants in Spencer Paynim foe to fight, For foreign land had left his native shore. This in his careful breast he always bore, And on it oft would cast his wary eye; For it by magick framed was of yore, So that no falshood mote it well abye, But it was plainly seen, or fearfully did fly. XL This on that gay assembly did he turn, And saw confounded quite the gawdy scene; Saw the close fire that inwardly did burn, And waste the throbbing heart with secret pain, anguish. teen; Saw base dependence in the haughty mien Of lords and princes; saw the magick chain That each did wear, but deem'd he wore unseen, The whiles with count'naunce glad he hid his pain, And homage did require from each poor lowly swain. XLI And tho' to that old mage they louted down, Yet did they dearly wish for his decay: Als trembled he, and aye upon the throne Of his great lord his tott'ring steps did stay, And oft behind him skulk'd for great dismay; Als shook the throne, when so the villain crew, That underneath oppress'd and groveling lay, Impatient of the grievous burthen grew, And loudly for redress and liberty did sue. XLII There mote he likewise see a ribbald train Of dancers, broid'rers, slaves of luxury, Who cast o'er all those lords and ladies vain A veil of semblaunce fair, and richest dye, That none their inward baseness mote descry. But nought was hidden from that mirrour bright: Which when false Archimago 'gan espy, He feared for himself, and warn'd the knight From so detested place to maken speedy flight. XLIII So on he passed, till he comen hath To a small river, that full slow did glide, As it uneath mote find its watry path For stones and rubbish, that did choak its tide, So lay the mould'ring piles on ev'ry side, Seem'd there a goodly city once had been, Albeit now fallen were her royal pride, Yet mote her auncient greatness still be seen, Still from her ruins prov'd the world's imperial queen. XLIV For the rich spoil of all the continents, The boast of art and nature there was brought, Corinthian brass, Ægyptian monuments, With hieroglyphick sculptures all inwrought, And Parian marbles, by Greek artists taught To counterfeit the forms of heroes old, And set before the eye of sober thought Lycurgus, Homer, and Alcides bold. All these and many more that may not here be told. XLV There in the middest of a ruin'd pile, That seem'd a theatre of circuit vast, Where thousands might be seated, he erewhile Discover'd hath an uncouth trophy plac'd; Seem'd a huge heap of stone together cast In nice disorder and wild symmetry, Urns, broken freezes, statues half defac'd, And pedestals with antique imagery Emboss'd, and pillars huge of costly porphyry. XLVI Aloft on this strange basis was placed. ypight With girlonds gay adorn'd a golden chair, In which aye smiling with self-bred delight, In careless pride reclin'd a lady fair, And to soft musick lent her idle ear; The which with pleasure so did her enthrall, That for aught else she had but little care, For wealth, or fame, or honour feminal, Or gentle love, sole king of pleasures natural. XLVII Als by her side, in richest robes array'd, An eunuch sate, of visage pale and dead, Unseemly paramour for royal maid! Yet him she courted oft and honoured, And oft would by her place in princely seat or place. sted, Though from the dregs of earth he springen were, And oft with regal crowns she deck'd his head, And oft, to sooth her vain and foolish ear, She bade him the great names of mighty emperors. Kesars bear. XLVIII Thereto herself a pompous title bore, For she was vain of her great auncestry, But vainer still of that prodigious store Of arts and learning, which she vaunts to lie In the rich archives of her treasury. These she to strangers oftentimes would shew, With grave demean and solemn vanity, Then proudly claim as to her merit due, The venerable praise and title of Vertù. XLIX Vertù she was called or named. yclep'd, and held her court With outward shews of pomp and majesty, To which natheless few others did resort, But men of base and vulgar industry. Or such perdy as of them cozen'd be, Mimes, fidlers, pipers, eunuchs squeaking fine, Painters and builders, sons of masonry, Who could well measure with the rule and line, And all the orders five right craftily define. L But other skill of cunning architect, How to contrive the house for dwelling best, With self-sufficient scorn they wont neglect, As corresponding with their purpose least; And herein be they copied of the rest, Who aye pretending love of science fair, And gen'rous purpose to adorn the breast With lib'ral arts, to Vertù's court repair, Yet nought but tunes and names, and coins away do bear. LI For long, to visit her once-honour'd seat The studious sons of learning have forbore: Who whilom thither ran with pilgrim feet Her venerable reliques to adore, And load her bosom with the sacred store, Whereof the world large treasure yet enjoys. But since. sithence she declin'd from wisdom's lore, They left her to display her pompous toys To virtuosi vain, and wonder-gaping boys. LII Forthy to her a num'rous train doth belong. long Of ushers in her court well practised, Who aye about the monied stranger throng, Off'ring with shews of courteous good-nature or civility. bountihed Him through the rich apartments all to lead, And shew him all the wonders of her state, Whose names and price they wisely can relate or declare. These under sort of antiquarians, who go about with strangers to shew them the antiquities, &amp;c. of Rome, are called Ciceroni. areed, And tell of coins of old and modern date, And pictures false and true right well discriminate. LIII Als are they named after him, whose tongue Shook the dictator in his curule chair, And thund'ring through the Roman senate, rung His bold Philippics in Antonius' ear; Which when the Fairy heard, he sigh'd full dear, And casting round his quick discerning eye, At ev'ry At every turn, every now and then. deal he dropt a manly tear, As he the stately buildings mote descry, Baths, theatres, and fanes in mould'ring fragments lie. LIV And, oh! imperial city! then he said, How art thou tumbled from thine Alpine throne! Whereon, like Jove on high Olympus' head, Thou sittedst erst unequall'd and alone, And madedst through the world thy greatness known; While from the western isles, to Indus' shore, From seven-mouth'd Nilus, to the frozen Don, Thy dradded bolts the strong-pounc'd Eagle bore, And taught the nations round thy Fasces to adore. LV And doth among thy reliques nought remain, No little portion of that haughty spright? Which made thee whilom scorn soft Pleasure's chain, And in free Virtue place thy chief delight, Whereby through ages shone thy glory bright? And is there nought remaining to confound Those, who regardless of thy woeful plight, With idle wonder view thy ruins round, And without thought survey thy memorable wound? LVI Arise, thou genuine Cicero, and declare That all these mighty ruins scatter'd wide, The sepulchres of Roman virtue were, And trophies vast of Luxury and Pride, Those fell diseases whereof Rome erst dy'd. And do you then with vile mechanic thought Your course, ye sons of Fairy, hither guide, That ye those gay refinements may be taught, Which Liberty's fair lond to shame and thraldom brought? LVII Let Rome those vassal arts now meanly boast, Which to her vanquish'd thralls she erst resign'd; Ye who enjoy that freedom she has lost, That great prerogative of human-kind, Close to your hearts the precious jewel bind, And learn the rich possession to maintain, Learn Virtue, Justice, Constancy of Mind, Not to be mov'd by Fear or Pleasure's train; Be these your arts, ye brave, these only are humane. LVIII As he thus spake, th'enchaunter half asham'd Wist not what fitting answer to devise, Als was his caitive heart well-nigh inflam'd, By that same knight so virtuous, brave and wise, That long he doubts him farther to entice. But he was harden'd and remorseless grown, Through practice old of villainy and vice; So to his former wiles he turns him soon, As in another place hereafter shall be shown. THE INSTITUTION OF THE ORDER OF THE GARTER. A Dramatic POEM. By the Same. ? Lectos ex omnibus Oris Evehis; &amp; meritum, non quæ cunabula quæris, Et qualis, non unde satus: sub teste benigno Vivitur; egregios invitant præmia mores. Claud. HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE. Dramatis Personæ. Edward the Third, King of England, &amp;c. Philippa, Queen of England, &amp;c. Edward, Prince of Wales. John, The order of the Garter was instituted on St. George's day the 23d of April 1350. King John came into England in 1357. I have taken the advantage of the licence usually allowed to poets, of departing a little from chronology; and have postponed for a few years the institution of this order, for the sake of rendering that solemnity more august, by introducing king John of France, who, though a prisoner, was treated both by Edward and his son the prince of Wales with all the regard due to the quality and virtue of so great a prince. To alleviate his captivity, Edward entertained him and the other French prisoners with diversions of various kinds: among which a tournament he held at Windsor on the 23d of April, to solemnize the feast of St. George, the patron of the order of the Garter, held the chief place; and was, as Rapin tells us, the most sumptuous and magnificent that had ever been seen in England. The duke of Brabant, with several other sovereign princes, and an infinite number of knights of all nations were present, and splendidly entertained. King of France, &amp;c. Genius of England.

Flourish of aërial musick at a distance, after which the following verses are sung in the air by Spirits, while the Genius of England descends. First Spirit. Hither, all ye heav'nly pow'rs, From your empyreal bow'rs; From the fields for ever gay, From the star-pav'd milky way, From the moon's relucent horn, From the star that wakes the morn; From the bow, whose mingling dyes Sweetly cheer the frowning skies; From the silver cloud that sails Shadowy o'er the darken'd vales; From th'Elysiums of the sky, Spirits immortal, hither fly! Chorus of Spirits. Fly, and through the limpid air Guard in pomp the sliding car, Which to his terrestrial throne Wafts Britannia's Genius down. Second Spirit. Hither, all ye heav'nly pow'rs! From your empyreal bow'rs! Chiefly ye, whose brows divine Crown'd with starry circlets shine; Who in various labours try'd, Once Britannia's strength and pride, Now in everlasting rest Share the glories of the blest! Peers and nobles of the sky, Spirits immortal, hither fly! Chorus of Spirits. Fly, and through the limpid air Guard in pomp the sliding car, Which to his terrestrial throne Wafts Britannia's Genius dawn. Third Spirit. Hither too, ye tuneful throng, Masters of enchanting song, Sacred bards! whose rapt'rous strains Sooth the toiling hero's pains, Sooth the patriot's gen'rous cares; Sweetly thro' their ravish'd ears Whisp'ring to th'immortal mind Heav'nly visions, hopes refin'd; Hopes of endless peace and fame, Safe from envy's blasting flame, Pure, sincere, in those abodes, Where to throngs of list'ning gods, Hymning bards, to virtue's praise, Tune their never-dying lays. Sweet encomiasts of the sky, Spirits immortal, hither fly! Chorus of Spirits. Fly, and charm the limpid air, While the softly-sliding car, To his sea-encircled throne Wafts Britannia's Genius down. Chorus of Bards descends, dress'd in long flowing sky-colour'd robes spangled with stars, with garlands of oaken boughs upon their heads, and golden harps in their hands, made like the Welch, or old British harp. Before they appear, they sing the chorus, and afterwards, as they descend, the following songs; at the last stanza of which, the chariot of the Genius appears, and descends gradually all the while that and the grand chorus is singing. Chorus of Bards. Gentle Spirit, we obey; Thus along th'ætherial way, We attend our monarch's car; Thus we charm the silent air. SONG. First Bard. [1] Ye southern gales, that ever fly In frolic April's vernal train, Who, as ye skim along the sky, Dip your light pinions in the main, Then shake them fraught with genial show'rs, O'er blooming Flora's primrose bow'rs: 2 Now cease awhile your wanton sport, Now drive each threat'ning cloud away; Then to the flow'ry vale resort, And hither all its sweets convey; And ever as ye dance along, With soft murmurs aid our song. SONG II. Second Bard. But lo! fair Windsor's tow'rs appear, And hills with spreading oaks imbrown'd! Hark! hark! the voice of joy I hear, Sung by a thousand echoes round; And now I view a glitt'ring train, In triumph march o'er yonder plain. Grand Chorus of Spirits and Bards. Hail mighty nation! ever fam'd in war! Lo! heav'n descends thy festivals to share; To view those heroes, whose immortal praise Celestial bards shall sing in living lays. At the conclusion of this chorus, the Genius alights from his chariot, the front of which resembling the head of a man of war, is adorned with a carved lion, holding before his breast the arms of England, as they were borne by Edward. Behind, on a rais'd seat, sits the Genius, leaning upon an anchor of silver, and bearing in his right hand the vindicta, or wand of enfranchisement, and in his left a roll of parchment, upon which is written, in large letters of gold, Magna Charta. On his head is a corona rostrata, or naval crown; and his robe, of a sea-green colour, is embroidered with cornucopia's and golden tridents. Genius. Disdain not, ye blest denizens of air, To breathe this grosser atmosphere awhile, Your service I shall need; mean time resort To yon imperial palace, and in air Draw up your squadrons in a radiant orb, Suspended o'er those lofty battlements, Like the bright halo that invests the moon, Or Saturn's lucid ring: thence shed benign Your choicest influence on the noble train, There on this solemn day assembled round The throne of British Edward: I awhile Must here await th'approach of other spirits, Sage Druids, Britain's old philosophers; Fetch'd by my summons from the western isles, That, scatter'd o'er the rough Hibernian flood, Seem like huge fragments by the wild wave torn From stormy Scotland, and the Cambrian shore. There, from the world retir'd in secret shades, Chiefly where Breint and Meinai wash'd the oaks Of ancient Mona, their academies And schools of sage and moral discipline They held; and to the neighb'ring Britons round, From their rever'd tribunals, holy mounts, Dispens'd at once their oracles and laws. 'Till fierce Paulinus, and his Roman bands, Them and their gods defying, drove them thence To seek for shelter in Hibernian shades. Yet still enamour'd of their ancient haunts, Unseen of mortal eyes, they hover round Their ruin'd altars, consecrated hills Once girt with spreading oaks, mysterious rows Of rude enormous obelisks, that rise Orb within orb, stupendous monuments Of artless architecture, such as now Oft times amaze the wand'ring traveller, By the pale moon discern'd on Sarum's plain. But hence, aërial spirits: lo, they come! Here the Spirits and Bards, together with the chariot of the Genius, reascend, and at the same time the Druid senter, cloath'd in dark-colour'd coarse stuff gowns which before hang no lower than the knee, but behind almost touch the ground. The sleeves of these gowns reach down below the elbow, and from behind comes up a sort of hood or cowle, which hangs loose about the head and forehead. From the left shoulder hangs in a string a kind of pouch, or scrip, and rests on the right hip. In their right hand they hold a staff, and in their left an oaken branch. Their beards are very large and long, reaching below their waists. Their legs are naked, and their feet shod with sandals, which are fastened by thongs wound about the foot and the small of the leg.

Inform us, happy spirit, protecting pow'r Of this our ancient country, wherefore now From our sequester'd vallies, pensive groves And dark recesses, thou hast summon'd us To wait thy orders on this flow'ry hill? Genius. A great event, sage Druids, that no less Imports than this your ancient country's fame, From contemplation, and your silent shades, Calls you to meet me on this flow'ry hill. Know, in yon castle, whose proud battlements Sit like a regal crown upon the brow Of high-climbing lawn, doth Edward hold This day his solemn session to receive The pleas of all th'aspiring candidates, Who, summon'd by the Edward having communicated his intention of instituting the order of the Garter to the great council of his realm, and having receiv'd their approbation, dispatch'd his heralds to severals parts of Europe, to invite all that were eminent for military virtue, &amp;c. to be present at its institution. And his queen Philippa, on her part, assembled a train of 300 of the fairest ladies to grace the solemnity, and add to its magnificence. herald's publick voice, To Windsor, as to Fame's bright temple, haste From ev'ry shore; the noble, wise, and brave, Knights, senators, and statesmen, lords and kings; Ambitious each to gain the splendid prize, By Edward promis'd to transcendent worth. For who of mortals is too great and high In the career of virtue to contend? Of these selecting the most glorious names, Doth England's monarch purpose to compose A princely brotherhood, himself the chief, And worthy sov'reign of th'illustrious band; A band of heroes, listed in the cause Of honour, virtue, and celestial truth, Under the name and holy patronage Of Cappadocian George, Britannia's saint. Such is the plan by gen'rous Edward form'd; A plan of glory, that beyond the reach Of his own conquering arms, shall propagate The sov'reignty of Britain, and erect Her monarchs into judges of mankind. But from this day's decisions, from the choice Of his first collegues, shall succeeding times Of Edward judge, and on his fame pronounce. For dignities and titles, when misplac'd Upon the vicious, the corrupt and vile, Like princely virgins to low peasants match'd, Descend from their nobility, and soil'd By base alliance, not their pride alone And native splendor lose, but shame retort Ev'n on the sacred throne, from whence they sprung, So may the lustre of this order bright, This eldest child of chivalry be stain'd, If at her first espousals, her great sire, Caught by the specious outsides, that deceive And captivate the world, admit the suit Of vain pretenders void of real worth; Light empty bubbles, by the wanton gale Of fortune swell'd, and only form'd to dance And glitter in the sun-shine of a court. Begin we then with Edward; first let him At his own high tribunal undergo The rigid inquisition—I for this Have left my lucid star-encircled throne: For this, immortal sages have requir'd Your wise and prudent ministry, well skill'd In various science and the human heart. Search Edward's to the bottom: sound the depths And shallows of his soul; if he possess That first of regal talents, to discern With quick-ey'd penetration, thro' the veil Of art, each character's intrinsick worth, And all the labyrinths of the human mind. Nor blush for this good end yourselves to wear Fallacious forms to plead the cause of false But specious merit; at his throne appear In borrow'd shapes, and there with artfulguile, When the shrill trumpet cites the candidates, Urge your pretensions: all the pow'r employ Of wit and eloquence: Edward, I trust, The trial shall abide; which shall but tend To manifest, that not from arrogance, But conscious virtue, hath he thus assum'd Above all other kings, to be the judge And great rewarder of heroic deeds. Nor wholly unassisted will I leave My royal charge, but with blest influence clear His intellectual eye from the dim mists It haply hath contracted from a long Unebbing current of felicity, Unhop'd, unequall'd triumphs, from the view Of captive monarchs, and the glitt'ring throng, Who at his summons from all climates come, To take, as from their sov'reign, honours new. When heav'n tries mortals in unusual ways, 'Tis fit it should afford unusual aid. Now, sages, to yon spreading oaks retire There wait my summons; and mean time advise How best to execute the task enjoin'd. [Ex. Gen. and Druids. The Scene changes to a large room in the castle (St. George's Hall) at the upper end of which is a royal canopy with the figure of St George, and the motto of the Garter, Honi Soit qui maly pense, beneath it embroider'd in gold. Under this canopy appears seated on an elevation of two or three steps, king Edward, in the habit of the order of the Garter, with a sceptre in his right hand, and a globe in his left. On his left hand is seated queen Philippa, with a crown upon her head, and dress'd in a royal mantle of crimson velvet, powder'd with embroider'd garters, and an enamel'd That the ladies of the knights of the Garter wore this ensign of the order upon their left arms, may be seen in Ashmole's History of the Garter. garter bound like a bracelet upon her left arm. By her stand a great number of ladies very richly dress'd. On Edward's right hand is seated king John, in the imperial robes of France; and on the same side, but a step lower, sits Edward the Black Prince, in the robes belonging to the Prince of Wales. Next to queen Philippa are seated the rest of Edward's children; and next to the Black Prince, on the other side, stand the French prisoners, and a great number of lords, &amp;c. richly dress'd. On the floor, at some distance, stands Garter king at arms in the habit of his office, holding in his hand a Garter, with the grand collar of the order. Near him stand other heralds, ushers, attendants, &amp;c. Flourish of trumpets, kettle-drums, &amp;c. After which Edward rising up from his throne, addresses himself to the assembly. Edward. That hither from your distant residence, By solemn invitation, noble guests, I have entreated your illustrious train, Misconstrue not to levity and pride, Or ostentatious vain magnificence, Unworthy the grave majesty of kings, Unworthy your attention, my renown. This bright assemblage of the wise, the brave, The noble, the magnificent, the fair, The ornaments of Europe, have I sought To grace the pomp of Virtue, to adorn With noblest off'rings her unspotted shrine, Attracting thus to her divine commands The aweful veneration of mankind. This was the cause, great princes, this the call, The voice of Virtue, not of England's king, That with respectful zeal ye hear'd and follow'd: From Burgundy's rich vineyards, from the meads Of Hainault and Brabant, the rocky wave Of Danube, from Germania's warlike tow'rs, Imperial mother of an hundred states; From Spain, long exercis'd by Moorish arms, From Italy's fair princedoms, and the walls Of sea-wash'd Venice, Adria's haughty spouse. With me then, all ye virtuous, by what stile Recorded in the registers of fame, Knights, senators, or soldiers, ermin'd lords, Or scepter'd princes; from whatever clime Ye come, ennobled by heroic acts, With me unite the splendor of your names To dignify th'erection of a new And noble order, which to heav'n's high praise, And to heav'n's champion Cappadocian George, On this his holy festival I mean To found a recompence for worthiest deeds. Thus as the orient sun, ador'd of old By prostrate Persia, ow'd his deity Less to that genial and benignant heat That cherishes and warms the seeds of life, Than to those gorgeous beams, that deck with gold And crimson the gay portals of the morn; So shall this rising order owe its fame And brightest lustre to the splendid train Of lords and purpled princes, who are met This day to usher and adorn its birth. Nor deem that to allure heroic minds, My private int'rests partially to serve, To list the valiant in ambition's cause, And form a league of conquest, I have laid In subtle policy this great design: Asham'd be he who with malignant eye So reads my purpose: and be he accurs'd Whoe'er in after-times shall so pervert This sacred institution. To the world I here consign it, to the good and great Of every age and clime, and them alone. Now sound the trumpet; bid the candidates With confidence appear, and urge their claims. Edward being engaged in a war with France, for the obtaining that crown, in order to draw into England great multitudes of foreigners, with whom he might negotiate either for their personal service, or aids of troops to assist him in that undertaking, ordered, during the truce that then subsisted between the two crowns, publication to be made of a great tournament, to be held at Windsor; an expedient, says Rapin, which could not fail of success, because it was entirely agreeable to the taste of that age. Accordingly many persons of distinction came over, to all of whom he gave an honourable reception, caressing them in such a manner that they could never sufficiently admire his politeness, magnificence, and liberality. To render these entertainments the more solemn, and to free himself also from the ceremonies, to which the difference of rank and condition would have subjected him, he caused a circular hall of boards to be run up at Windsor, 200 feet in diameter. There it was that he feasted all the knights at one table, which was called the Round Table, in memory of the great Arthur, who, as it is pretended, instituted an order of knighthood by that name. Next year he caused a more solid building to be erected, that he might continue yearly the same diversions. During that time he treated with these several lords about the aids, wherewith each could furnish him, in proportion to his forces. His rival king Philip could not see without jealousy, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Flemings, and Frenchmen themselves flock to England to assist at these tournaments. He suspected some hidden design in these ntertainments, and to break Edward's measures, caused the like to be published in his dominions; which meeting with success, proved a countermine to Edward's main design, so that he did not long continue to keep up his round table. From thence, however, it is generally agreed, he took the first hint of instituting the order of the Garter. But as his purpose in erecting this order was very different from that which had induced him to revive Arthur's round table, as he had in this no private views, no ambitious scheme of engaging such as should be admitted into this fraternity to assist him in his wars, he thought proper, in order to obviate the like jealousies and suspicion as had alarmed king Philip, to signify by his motto the purity of his intentions, and to retort shame upon all those who should put any malignant construction upon his design in instituting this order. This therefore I take to be the true meaning and import of the famous motto, Honi soit qui mal y pense. The not understanding the purport of which, gave rise, in all probability, to that vulgar story of the countess of Salisbury's garter, rejected by all the best writers. Flourish of trumpets, &amp;c. which is answered by another trumpet from without; then enter a grandee of Spain, magnificently attir'd in the Spanish habit, holding in his hand the pedigree of his family, and preceded by heralds, &amp;c. bearing atchievements, banners, coats of armour, helmets, gauntlets, spurs, &amp;c. Spaniard. Illustrious monarch! emp'ror of the isles! My name is Guzman—from those heroes sprung, Who with Pelagio 'mid th'Asturian rocks Against th'invasion of unnumber'd Moors, Maintain'd the fame and empire of the Goths, And founded at Oviedo once again The Spanish monarchy and cath'lick faith, Transporting from the mountain's dreary womb To glitt'riug temples her most holy altars. Thence on the bordering Moor their valiant sons Waging incessant war, ere long regain'd Their ancient realms of Leon, Arragon, And rich Castilia: in which great exploits My brave progenitors, by valour, zeal, And loyalty distinguish'd, from their kings Gain'd those high honours, princely signories, And proud prerogatives, which have extoll'd The name of Guzman to such envy'd grandeur, That scarce above it towers the regal throne. These honours undiminish'd, undefil'd, To me deliver'd down, might well content A vulgar mind; but spirits highly born Are full of gen'rous and aspiring thoughts; And use the vantage ground of rank and pow'r But to ascend still higher. Thus I come Thy Garter to sollicit; pleas'd, great prince, With thee to be enroll'd thy brother knight, And fearing no repulse. Nobility, As nearest in her orbit, first receives The beams of majesty; alone can bear The fulness of that glory, which o'erpow'rs Inferior natures. Virtue's self would blush, Did she at once approach too near the throne. But the young eagle borne amid the blaze Of glancing lightnings, with undazzled eye Soars to the courts of heav'n, and perches bold On the bright sceptre of imperial Jove. The greatest king is he, who is the king Of greatest subjects. Seek'st thou to advance The glory of thy order? To thy self Associate those, whose high-exalted names For ages past from Envy's self have forc'd Habitual veneration, never paid To new and upstart merit. Such am I, Whose pure and gen'rous blood descending down From noblest fountains, in its course enrich'd By glorious mixtures with each royal stream That fair Iberia boasts, might ev'n pretend To thy alliance, Edward. View this scroll, The faithful blazon of my ancient line, A line of potentates, whose ev'ry son Deserv'd to wear the Garter I demand. In me their representative, the heir, Of all their honours, son of their renown, Do thou reward their virtues: in their names I claim, and on hereditary right, The right of monarchs, Edward, rest my plea. Edward. The high desert of thy renown'd forefathers Well hast thou shewn; but hast thou therefore prov'd Thy self deserving to be call'd their son? To thee their prosp'rous virtues have indeed Transmitted lineal rank, and titles proud, By them more hardly gain'd; for which thou stand'st To custom and th'indulgence of thy country Indebted, Guzman, in a large account; Which thou must first discharge by noble deeds, Ere thou canst stile those dignities thine own. This if thou hast not paid, why dost thou seek, Like thriftless prodigals, to swell the debt, And overwhelm thy self with obligations? Virtue is honour, and the noblest titles Are but the public stamps set on the ore To ascertain its value to mankind. It were a kind of treason to my crown, To mark base metal with the royal impress, And put off lazy pride in virtue's name. Wou'dst thou attain my Garter? Seek it there Where thy heroic ancestors acquir'd Their glorious honours, in th'embattled field Among the squadrons of the warlike Moors: Or in the council of thy king, by truth And wisdom equal to th'important trust. Be what thy fathers were, and then return To ask the pledge of merit from my hand, And be the fit companion of a king. [Exit Spaniard. Flourish of trumpets, &amp;c. which, as before, is answered by another trumpet from without; then enter an usurer and senator of Genoa (at that time the bank of Europe) dress'd in his senatorial gown of black velvet, profusely, but aukwardly adorn'd with jewels, pearls and diamond necklaces, pendents, bracelets, rings, such as he may be supposed to have received as pawns, and to wear rather as marks of his great riches, than as ornaments of his dress. He is attended by a large train of people of every profession, appearing to be his debtors, by their abject and timid countenances, at the head of whom, and next to the usurer, marches a scrivener, bearing a large bundle of bonds, mortgages, &amp;c. Genoese. From Genoa the opulent, the bank And treasury of the world, most puissant king, Invited by thy heralds, am I come To claim the honour by thy promise due, Due by thy justice to superior worth; Due then to me, great Edward, who possess That object of the toils, the cares, the vows Of all mankind, that comprehensive good, Source of all pow'r and grandeur, boundless wealth. Behold yon glitt'ring train, whose sumptuous pride, Bright with the treasures of each precious mine, Invests with glory thy imperial throne: Whence is their dignity? The ray august, That awes and dazzles the respectful crowd, Proceeds it from nobility, from virtue, Their wisdom, or their valour, or their fame? Comes it not rather from the beaming ore? The diamond's star-like radiance? Wealth, O king, Wealth is the sun that decks the gorgeous scene; That cherishes, adorns, and calls to view These princely flowers of honour, virtue, fame, Which in the shades of poverty were lost. Whatever men desire or venerate, On wealth attends; ev'n empire's self is bought. Nor cou'd the mighty Julius have attain'd By wisdom or by valour sov'reign pow'r, Had not the gold of vanquish'd Gaul subdu'd The liberties of Rome. On wretched want, Contempt and narrow-soul'd dependence wait. Ev'n kings, of necessary wealth depriv'd, In powerless indigence lose all respect, All homage from their subjects: while the rich, Like gods ador'd, o'er ev'ry neck extend Their potent sceptres, and in golden chains Fierce Faction and rebellious Freedom bind. The glory, strength, importance of a realm Is measur'd by its riches: Venice thus, Thus Genoa's petty state out-balances, In Europe's scale, the boundless wilds that cloath With tributary furs the Russian Czar. With like pre-eminence exalted shines In ev'ry land above the proudest names, The blest possessor of all-worship'd gold. My birth or rank I boast not here, though born A senator of Genoa. The desert, On which I found my claim, is all my own; To have adorn'd and dignify'd the state Of my declining house with greater wealth Than e'er my thriftless ancestors possess'd; Whose richest acquisitions were but sprigs Of barren laurel, or the flaunting rags Of some torn ensign, to their needy son A worthless heritage. Yet not to swell My narrow fortunes wou'd my soul descend To the base methods of ignoble trade, And vulgar mercantile pursuit of gain. Mine were the noble arts of raising gold From gold, of nursing and improving wealth By gainful use; arts practis'd heretofore By senators and sages of old Rome, Illustrious Crassus, and wise Seneca. Thus have I grac'd the splendor of my name With suitable possessions; thus I hold In firm subjection to my will the poor Of ev'ry rank and order, soldier, priest, The vent'rous merchant, and the sumptuous lord, Who in a lower vassalage to me, Than to thy sceptre, Edward, bow their heads, Pledging their lands and liberties for gold. Hence am I bold to stand before thy throne A candidate for glory's highest prize: And let me add, that policy alone Should teach thy prudence to approve my claim; Shou'd teach thee in thy subjects to excite, By honours on superior wealth bestow'd, An useful emulation to be rich: Which once inspir'd, thy Albion shall become The first of nations, thou the first of kings. Edward. Hadst thou by op'ning to thy native land The golden veins of commerce, by employing The useful hands of industry in works Of national advantage, by uniting Remotest regions in the friendly bands And honest intercourse of mutual trade; Hadst thou by these humane and generous arts, Which thy mistaken pride so much disdains, Enrich'd at once thy country and thy self, Then not unworthy hadst thou been to wear The brightest marks of honour; but thy wealth, The base-born child of sordid usury, That foe to commerce, nurse of idleness, Stains and degrades thee from thy noble birth; Nor in the usurer can I discern The senator of Genoa.—To enlarge The mind with gen'rous sentiments, to raise Its aims by virtuous emulation, here I sit; but not to gild with honour's beams That selfish passion which congeals the heart, And stops the streams of sweet benevolence, Mean avarice, the vice of narrowest souls, Incapable of glory.—Wealth, thou say'st, Can buy ev'n empire, and to Julius gave Dominion o'er his country—Fatal gift, And ruinous to both! But what to Rome, What to that Cæsar's successors avail'd The boundless treasures of the ravag'd world, When they had lost their virtue? Did not soon The valiant sons of poverty, the Goths, The Huns and Vandals, from their barren hills And rugged woods descending, to their steel Subject the Roman gold? Yet I deny not The pow'r and use of riches: to the wise And good, in publick or in private life, They are the means of virtue, and best serve The noblest purposes; but in the use, Not in the bare possession, lies the merit. Shew me thy merit then, thy bounteous acts, Publick munificence, or private alms, The hungry and the naked, and the sick, Sustain'd and cherish'd by thy saving hand; Plead this, and I allow thy worthy claim, For this is virtue, and deserves reward. Ex. Gen. Flourish of trumpets, &amp;c. which is answered by a symphony of flutes, violins, &amp;c. playing a light amorous air; then appears a Neapolitan courtier, a favourite of queen Joan, who then reign'd at Naples, and whose court was the most debauch'd and dissolute of that age. He comes in with a gay and affected gesture, and is dress'd in loose silken robes, rich, but finical and effeminate; on his hair, which is curl'd and spread all over his shoulders down to the middle of his back, he wears a chaplet of roses, and is attended by a train of beautiful boys, habited like Cupids, and musicians, who, as he marches towards the throne, continue playing their soft and wanton airs. Neapolitan. Not on my wealth, nor on my noble blood, Shall I presume to claim thy royal gift, Auspicious prince, but on the skill to give That splendor to nobility and wealth, That elegance of taste, from which alone Their value they derive; of this to judge, This to direct, I boast, fit arbiter Of all refin'd delights.—But chief to kings My happy talents I devote; on them My genius waits with duteous care, and wafts The golden cup of pleasure to their lips, Like Ganymede before the throne of Jove. And who indeed would wish to be a god Only to thunder, and to hear the pray'rs Of clam'rous suitors? 'Tis the nectar'd feast, The dance of Graces, and the wanton charms Of Venus, sporting with the Smiles and Loves, That make the court of heav'n a blest abode. Far happier were the meanest peasant's lot Who sleeps or sings in careless ease beneath The sun-burnt hay-cock, or the flow'ry thorn, Than to be plac'd on high in anxious pride, The purple drudge and slave of tiresome state, If to superior pow'r superior means Of joy were not annex'd, and larger scope For ev'ry wish the lavish heart can form: If the soft hand of pleasure did not wreathe Around the royal diadem, whose weight Oppressive loads the monarch's aching brow, Her fairest growth of ever-blooming flow'rs. On thee, victorious prince, propitious Fortune Hath pour'd her richest gifts, renown and wealth, And greatness equal to thy mighty mind; One only bliss is wanting to thy court, Voluptuous elegance, the lovely child Of ease and opulence; that never comes, But like a bird of summer to attend The brightest sun-shine of a glorious state. To her, and her alone belongs the task, By learned delicacy to remove What yet remains in this thy ancient realm Of Gothick barbarism, the rust of war, And valiant ignorance.—Her artful hand Thy rugged Britons shall refine, and teach More courtly manners, to their sov'reign's will Politely pliant: do but thou command Thy willing servant, with thy favours grac'd, From fair Joanna's ever-smiling court, Under whose happy influence I was train'd, From polish'd Naples, her delightful seat, The blooming goddess to transport, with all Her train of joys, and fix them here beneath Thy great protection.—But perhaps thou fear'st The voice of censure, and the grave reproof Of moralizing dullness: idle fear! The vulgar herd, indeed, religious craft And policy of state have well confin'd With wise severity to rigid laws: Else would that headstrong beast the multitude Forget obedience, and its rider's voice Disdain. But shall the rider put a curb In his own mouth? The laws that kings have made Shall they restrain the makers? Edward, no! For thee indulgent justice shall relax Her harsh decrees, and piety shall wait To give her rev'rend sanction to thy will. 'Tis thine to rove at large thro' nature's field, Crop ev'ry flow'r, and taste of ev'ry fruit; By sweet variety provoking still The languid appetite to new desires. Nor useless to thy pleasures, happy prince, Shall be my faithful service; nicer joys, Joys of a quicker, more exalted taste, Than ever ripen'd in this northern clime, The growth of softer regions, shall my hand By skilful culture in thy Britain raise. To them, whose gross and dull capacities Are fit to bear the burthens of the state, The lab'ring mules, that thro' the mire of forms Draw the slow car of government along, Gladly the task of bus'ness I resign. Be mine the brighter province, to direct Thy pleasures, Edward, minister supreme Of all thy softer hours: to serve the king Be theirs the glory, let me serve the man. But shou'd thy sterner Genius, only pleas'd With arms and royalty's important cares, The duties of a king, my gentle arts Too lightly prize, and thence reject my suit: Permit at least, that to Philippa's ear, Divine Philippa, thine and beauty's queen, And her attendant graces, I may plead The cause of bliss, a cause so much their own: They will approve my claim, to whom the cares, The labours of my life, my head, my heart Are all devoted—Let me from their hands Receive the Garter, and be call'd their knight. Philippa. Permit me, gracious Edward, to reply To this irreverent flatt'rer, who presumes Before a matron and a queen to plead The cause of vice, and impudently hopes To find in her a fautress of his suit. But know, pernicious sophister, my heart Hath learn'd from Edward's love, and this high rank Which I partake with him, a noble pride, That ill can brook the too familiar eye And saucy tongue of riot and debauch; In whose unmanner'd light society, Nor majesty, nor virtue can maintain That dignity, which is their proper guard. Thy vile refinements, and luxurious arts, Miscall'd politeness, I detest; and feel, In the soft duties of a virtuous love, Such pure, serene delight, as far transcends What thou styl'st pleasure, the delirious joy Of an intoxicated feverish brain. Behold my royal lord, the first and best Of kings, the love and wonder of mankind! Behold my children, worthy their great sire, The gen'ral theme of praise and benediction! These are my pleasures; can thy skill bestow Superior bliss? Ah no, the vain attempt Wou'd only bring disgust, remorse, and shame. Edward. That I have lov'd, Philippa, and esteem'd thee More for thy virtues than those female charms, Which this vile flatterer deems singly worth His panegyrick, be thy happiness And glory, as it is thy Edward's pride. With the like spirit have I also woo'd And wedded sov'reign power; nor weakly caught With outward pomp, or seeking to myself A privilege to riot uncontroul'd In sensual pleasures, and behind the throne To laugh securely at restraint and law. No: I embrac'd her as the child of heav'n, Dowr'd with the ample means of doing good; From whose espousals I might hope to raise An offspring, worth th'ambition of a king, Immortal glory; to a gen'rous mind As far surpassing all the wanton toys, Which he calls pleasure, as thy faithful love (The sweet o'erflowing of heart-felt delight) Excels, Philippa, the lascivious smile Of common prostitutes, caress'd and loath'd. Hence from my sight with thy detested arts, Base minister of luxury, the bane Of ev'ry flourishing and happy state: Presume no more within my court to sing Thy Syren-song, nor soften into slaves And cowards my brave subjects.—I disdain That elegance, which such as thou can teach. Virtue alone is elegant, alone Polite; vice must be sordid and deform'd, Tho' to adorn her ev'ry art contend. And rather wou'd I see my Britons roam Untutor'd savages, among the woods, As once they did, in naked innocence, Than polish'd like the vile degenerate race Of modern Italy's corrupted sons. Exit Neap. Trumpet sounds, and is answer'd from without by another trumpet, which sounds a march, accompanied by kettle-drums, and other warlike instruments: Then enters, preceded by soldiers playing upon fifes, and others bearing tatter'd ensigns, standards and trophies, a leader of mercenary bands, compleatly arm'd from head to foot, and carrying in his right hand a baton or truncheon. On each side of him march his 'squires, one bearing his lance, the other his shield. Behind him, as his attendants, comes a train of officers and soldiers maimed, and their faces all seam'd with scars. Soldier. Nor riches, nor nobility of birth, Nor the soft arts of base effem'nate ease, Which justly thou rejectest, valiant prince, But thy own darling attribute I boast, Undaunted courage, try'd in many a field, In ev'ry clime, and under ev'ry banner, That for these forty summers have been wav'd O'er Europe's plains, by Ister, Rhine, and Po, Hungarian and Bohemian, Flemish, French, Venetian, Spanish, Guelph and Gibbeline: Whence in just confidence secure I come This military honour to demand, Due to my toils and service, to my wounds, My laurels, and that generous love of glory, Which without any call, or publick cause, Or private animosity, alone Rais'd my strong arm, and drew my dreadful sword. Wherever Mars his crimson flag display'd, That was my country, thither swift I bore My ready valour, and the dauntless band Of various nations, under my command, Prepar'd to sell their blood, their limbs, their lives: Nor where the right, nor where the justest cause, Deign'd we to ask—those intricate debates We left to lazy penmen in the shade Of coward ease; while our impetuous fire Still bore us forward, ardent to pursue Thro' danger's roughest paths the steps to fame. On such a spirit should thy favour smile. But let me wonder, Edward, that so long Thy ear the vain pretensions cou'd endure Of men unknown to war, attendants meet Of some luxurious Asiatic court, Or female distaff-reign; but suiting ill The presence of a monarch great in arms. Hadst thou to those inglorious sons of peace Thy martial order giv'n, the warrior-saint Had blush'd to see his image so profan'd, Which on my manly breast, indented o'er With many a noble scar, will fitly shine. But wherefore stand I thus haranguing here, Unskilful as I am in smooth discourse, The coward's argument? On force alone I rest my title: let the glorious prize Be hung on high amid the listed field, And let me there dispute it; there my lance Shall plead my cause far better than my tongue, If any dare deny my rightful claim. Edward. Not for the brave alone have I ordain'd This institution, but for all desert, All publick virtue, wisdom, all that serves, Improves, defends, or dignifies a state: Tho' first indeed to valour, as the guard Of all the rest, when in the publick cause, With justice and benevolence employ'd. But thou, base mercenary, canst thou dare The glorious name of valour to usurp, Who know'st no publick cause, no sense of right, Nor pity, nor affection, nor remorse? Who under any chief, in any quarrel, Canst stain with gore thy prostituted arms? Call it not love of glory; that is built On acts for the deliv'rance of mankind; On gen'rous principles, and noble scorn Of sordid int'rest: call it cruel pride, And savageness of nature, that delights To conquer, and oppress, afflict, insult; Or call it love of plunder, that can draw Unauthoris'd, uninjur'd, unprovok'd, The sword of war; that bravo-like can lift For hire the venal hand to perpetrate Assassinations, murders, massacres. But thou hast serv'd with courage: be it so— Thou hast thy pay, and with it thy reward; Pretend no farther, nor compare thy deeds, Dishonour'd by the mean desire of gain, With his, who for his country and his king Resigns his ease, his fortune, or his life. Those battles thou hast fought, those forty years Of blood and horror, which thy vaunting tongue So high hath sounded, are indeed thy crimes, Flagitious crimes; for which th'impartial bar Of reason wou'd condemn thee, as the foe Of human nature, did not custom screen By her unjust esteem thy guilty head. But hope not honour or employment here. Unsafe and wretched is that monarch's state Who weakly trusts to mercenary bands, The guard or of his person, or his realm: Unfaithful, insolent, rapacious, base He soon shall prove them, and become himself Their slave, to hold his kingdom at their will. For this within my Britain have I sought To raise a martial spirit, and ordain'd These new incitements, honours, and rewards, To virtuous chivalry, that never king Who wears hereafter my imperial crown, May need to stoop to the precarious aid Of venal foreign swords; but in the hearts Of his brave subjects find a stronger guard, Prepar'd with zeal unbought, and English valour, His rights to vindicate, and save their own. Exit Soldier. Trumpet sounds, to which another from without replies: Then enters an Italian politician, habited like a Venetian nobleman, who advancing with a solemn and important air towards the throne, makes a low reverence to king Edward, and proceeds. Politician. Well has thy sovereign wisdom, royal judge, The suit refus'd of these pretenders vain, And, by rejecting them, embolden'd me. For valour, and nobility, and wealth, Though by their proud possessors vaunted high, Are but subordinate, the slaves and tools, Not the companions, and the counsellors Of godlike monarchy; whose aweful throne By darksome clouds envelop'd, far beyond The ken of vulgar eyes, supported stands On that deep-rooted prop, the craft of state, Mysterious policy.—Who best hath learn'd Her wily lessons, best deserves to share The honours, counsels, and the hearts of kings. By him instructed, ev'n the meanest prince Shall rise to envy'd greatness, shall advance His dreaded pow'r above restraint and fear, And all the rules that in fantastic chains Inferior minds confine. Thus Milan's dukes, Thus Padua's lords above their country's laws Have rais'd their heads, and trampled to the dust The pride of freedom, that essays in vain Their high superior genius to controul. These were my masters, mighty prince; beneath Their rule, and in their councils was I form'd To know the false corrupted heart of man, His ev'ry weakness, ev'ry vice, and thence To tempt, or break his passions to the yoke: To scorn the publick as an empty name, And on the helpless multitude impose The adamantine bonds of fraud and force. Thus was I train'd, thus fitted to conduct The fate of proudest empires; thus I come To claim thy Garter, Edward, the just meed Of worth præeminent, and in return My services to offer, which no doubt Thy wisdom gladly will accept: for who So sit to serve the majesty of kings, As he, who slighting ev'ry meaner tye, Friends, parents, country, to advance their pow'r Devotes his toil, experience, fortune, fame, Nor other favour courts, nor refuge hopes But in their high protection?—Led by me, Thou, royal Edward, shalt attain that height, That glorious summit of imperial pow'r, Which not thy mighty ancestors have reach'd; Where in a freer air, a more enlarg'd Horizon, bounded only by thy will, Thou shalt exalted sit, and view beneath, In humbler distances and safer bounds, Those subjects, who presumptuous now approach Too near, and with rude hands profane thy throne. Nor let weak scruples check thy manly soul In the bright task of glory; know, great prince, A king's divinity is sov'reign pow'r, The only god, before whose shrine the wise Their incense offer, whence inspir'd, they draw Divine ambition, and heroic scorn Of vulgar prejudices, vulgar fears. Virtue's the people's idol, and by them Rewarded well with popular applause, That idle breath, the gift and prize of fools. 'Tis thine to govern, not to court mankind, Nor on their smiles precarious to depend, But nobly force them to depend on thine. O sacred sir, can virtue give thee this, This bright supremacy? Trust not her boasts, Her idle pageanty of barren praise: Reject her saucy claims, importunate, And self-supported; nor admit her train, Proud independency, and publick zeal, Those factious demagogues, the foes of kings. Edward. Are virtue then, and love of publick good, The foes of monarchy? and are deceit, Injustice and oppression, qualities Becoming and expedient in a king? Then know I not to govern; but have nurs'd For twice these fifteen years ev'n in my heart, A pois'nous viper; nay unking'd myself, By yielding to restrain my sov'reign pow'r With laws and charters of enfranchisement, Not due, it seems, from monarchs to their slaves. But know, vile counsellor of infamy, That I disdain thy politics, those false And shallow politics, by which my sire, Weak judging Edward, was betray'd to shame And foul destruction, while to such as thee His ear and heart incautious he resign'd, And was indeed their slave, not England's king. By maxims different far have I sustain'd The strength and splendor of my regal state, On the broad basis of true wisdom fix'd With solid firmness. By encouraging The gen'rous love of virtue and of fame, That source of valour, pledge of victory. By granting to my subjects, what indeed Is their inherent right, security, The cheerful father of content and peace, Of industry and opulence, which fills With smiling multitudes the land, and pays In willing subsidies that prince's care, Who lays up treasure in his people's hearts. By holding with a firm impartial hand The steddy scale of justice; not alone Betwixt my subjects in their private rights, But in the gen'ral, more important cause, Betwixt the crown and them, the diff'rent claims Of freedom and of just prerogative: Transgressing not myself by boundless pow'r, Nor suff'ring others to transgress those laws, That in their golden chain together bind, For common good, the whole united state. But more than all, by guarding from contempt, Or impious violation, that supreme Protrectress of all government and law, Religion; in whose train for ever wait Obedience, order, justice, mercy, love, A guard of angels plac'd around the throne. Her sacred counsels have I still rever'd, Her high commands enforc'd, her pow'r implor'd, O'er all my subject nations to call down From heav'nly wisdom, her eternal fire, A fix'd secure felicity, beyond The force of human prudence to attain. These are my arts of government, those arts By which my British crown I have advanc'd Above th'imperial diadem, above The pride of Afric's, or of Asia's thrones. I wou'd not tell thee this, but that thou seem'st A stranger to my fame, as to my realm, And to the real greatness of a king: Whose sacred dignity, by thee traduc'd, Much it behoves a king to vindicate; Not by rejecting only with disdain Thy arrogant pretensions, but in thee Dishonouring and branding with reproach Thy tenets also, the pernicious lore Of tyrants and usurpers, which thy tongue, Blaspheming justice, government, and law, Hath in a land of freedom dar'd to vent. Hence! from my kingdom, with thy quickest speed, Lest the revenge of an insulted king With sudden ruin intercept thy flight. Exit Politician. King John. Permit me, Edward, to thy royal voice To add my suffrage also, and with thee Protest against this coward policy, That meanly skulks behind opprobrious fraud, And low unprincely artifice; I feel A virtue in my heart, a gen'rous pride, That tells me kings were cloath'd with majesty, Encircled with authority, rever'd And almost deify'd, to teach them thence That goodness and the saving attributes Of heav'n become their office, justice chief, And truth, the virtue of heroic minds, Which, were it banish'd from all other breasts, Should dwell for ever in the hearts of kings. Aërial musick, upon which re-enter the five Druids who personated the Grandee, &amp;c. in their original characters and habits of Druids, the chief of whom advancing towards the throne, addresses himself to king Edward. Chief Druid. Behold in us, great king, the ancient priests And judges of this land, the Druids old: Who late in borrow'd characters have stood Before thy sage tribunal, to prefer The claims of valour, wealth, nobility, And those soft specious flatt'rers, who beneath The rosy wreath of pleasure and of love Conceal the sickly and disgustful brow Of riot and debauch, and often win From weak unmanly princes the rich prize To virtue due and wisdom, not to these The cankers of a state; but least of all Due to that traytor of his king and country, Who lab'ring to build up the regal throne Beyond its due proportion, and the strength Of those foundations which the laws have laid, O'erwhelms the people, and at once o'erturns His royal master, places him at best On an uneasy tott'ring pinnacle, The mark of execration and reproach. These claims hast thou rejected; like a king Discerning in mankind, and knowing well The value of his favours: like a king Deserving the high office of the judge And arbiter of Europe: like a king Equal to his great fame, and worth the care Of those immortal spirits, who this day Have quitted their celestial residence, To view and to approve thy glorious deeds. But, Edward, be not thou amaz'd to find That those who lately for thy favour su'd Were not the personages they assum'd. O king! thou art beset with counterfeits The very opposites to us, who seem Far better than they are. For Flattery, Cameleon-like, accommodates with care To the court-hue his changeful countenance. And when a prince is brave, magnanimous, And high in spirit, then Ambition wears A face of dignity, and nothing breathes But lofty enterprizes, conquest, pow'r. And schemes of glory to the sov'reign ear, Pretending love and care for his renown With more than duteous zeal.—Of these beware! For as the Theban queen, in fables old, Was, by the specious guile of fraudful Jove, In her Amphitryon's form to guilt betray'd, So by these counterfeits are kings seduc'd, Ev'n in the most belov'd suspectless shapes, To take a traytor to their royal arms. But thou shalt know them, Edward, by their works. And of this truth be most assur'd, that he, Who in his private commerce with mankind Is mean, dishonest, interested, false, Can ne'er be true to thee; nor can he love His prince, who feels not for his country's good. Thus warn'd we leave thee, mighty prince: be firm, Be constant in the paths of fair renown. Think it thy duty to revere thyself The sacred laws of chivalry, the wise Injunctions by thy order laid on all The garter'd knights; so shall thy fame remain The great example of all future kings. Farewell! for lo! the Genius of thy realm With all his pomp attended, comes to share, And grace the glories of this signal day. These clouds of fragrance, that far-beaming blaze Of heav'nly brightness, his approach declare. Druids vanish. Flashes of Light, and symphony of aërial musick. Genius of England descends in his chariot attended by spirits and bards; then alighting, he advances towards the throne, and addresses himself to Edward. Genius. From the gay realms of cloudless day I come, Where in the glitter of unnumber'd worlds, That like to isles of various magnitudes Float in the ocean of unbounded space; On my invisible aërial throne I sit, attended with a radiant band Of spirits immortal, whose pure essences, While clad in human shapes on earth they dwelt, Thro' the dull clay of gross mortality Disclos'd their heav'nly vigour, and burst forth In godlike virtues and heroic deeds, Their Albion gracing with as fair a growth Of fame, as e'er enrich'd imperial Rome. Thence ripe for heav'n and immortality, To me, the Genius of this happy isle, They fly, and claim the meed of their desert, Celestial crowns, and ever-living praise Recorded in the songs of heav'nly bards, That round my throne their hymns of triumph sing, Attuning to the sweet harmonious spheres Their undiscording lyres and voice divine. Nor thus remov'd to heav'n, and thus employ'd In careless raptures, wont they to forget Their native country, and the public weal, To which on earth their labours and their lives They once devoted; but pursuing still The bent and habit of their souls, with me They watch the British empire, still intent To check alternately th'incroaching waves Of regal pow'r and popular liberty: I, chief attentive near the royal throne, Take up my watchful station, to infuse My sage and mod'rate counsels in those ears, Which wisdom hath prepar'd and purify'd To relish honest, tho' unpleasing truth. Thus am I always, tho' invisible, Attendant, Edward, on thy glorious deeds. But on this solemn day have I vouchsaf'd To manifest my presence; to declare, Not in those whispers which have often spoke Peace to thy conscious heart, but audibly And evident to all, th'assent of heav'n To the great business, which hath gather'd here This troop of princes from all nations round. Hence all may know that virtue hath a train More bright than earthly empire can command: Know, that those actions which are great and good, Receive a nobler sanction from the free And universal voice of all mankind, Which is the voice of heav'n, than from the highest, The most illustrious act of regal pow'r. This nobler sanction, Edward, in the name Not of this age alone, but latest time, Here do I solemnly annex to each Of thy great acts, but chief to this most wise, Most virtuous institution, which extends Wide as thy fame, beyond thy empire's bound, A prize of virtue publish'd to mankind. Ye registers of heav'n, record the deed. Bards. Now tune, ye bards, the British lyre; Now wake the vocal string; While heav'n and earth in Edward's praise conspire, Join to the gen'ral voice your sacred choir, And on your soaring wing, From time and envy waft his glorious name, And place it in the shrine of incorruptive fame. Begin: the list'ning echoes round Shall catch with joy the long-forgotten sound, And warbling thro' each grove the British strain To Windsor's smiling nymphs, recall their Arthur's reign. Ye nymphs of Windsor's bow'ry woods, Ye pow'rs who haunt yon glist'ning floods, That with reluctant fond delay Around yon flow'ry valley stray; Say, from your minds hath time eras'd The pleasing images of glory pass'd? Review ye now those scenes no more? When nobly stain'd with Saxon gore, From Badon's long-contended plain Great Arthur with his martial train To Windsor's chosen shades repair'd, And with his knights the festive banquet shar'd. Then first exulting Thames beheld The triumphs of the listed field; Beheld along his level meads Careering knights, encount'ring steeds, Heroic games, whose toils inspire The thirst of praise, and kindle martial fire. Fair Peace in war's bright mail array'd, With smiles the glorious lists survey'd; So shou'd the brave (she cry'd) prepare Their hearts and sinewy arms for war: Such combats break not my repose, Such sons best guard my rights from daring foes. Then too in feastful hall or bow'r, Attendant on the genial hour, The British harp sweet lyrists strung, And Albion's generous victors sung: While valiant Arthur's copious fame Incessant fed the bright poetic flame. But mortals erring in excess, O'erwhelm the virtue they caress. Thus Arthur his great story mourn'd, By too fond praise to fable turn'd: Mourn'd the companions of his toils, Mock'd with false glory and fantastic spoils. 'Till thro' the dark romantic tale, Thro' superstition's magic veil, Sage Edward piercing view'd, and own'd The chief with genuine lustre crown'd: View'd the great model, and restor'd The long-lost honours of his martial board. Hail British prince! these faithful lays, Eternal records of heroic worth, Shall reassert thy ancient praise, And from the cloud of fiction call thee forth, In glory's sphere thy orbit to reclaim, And at great Edward's beam relume thy darken'd fame. But see in heav'nly panoply array'd, Whose streaming radiance skirts the clouds with gold, I view Pendragon burst the veiling shade, And all his blazing magnitude unfold! O'er yon broad tow'r he takes his airy stand, And pointing, Edward, towards the royal throne, To his fam'd knights around, a laurel'd band, Shews on thy knee the bright sky-tinctur'd zone. Virtue, he cries, (th'ætherial sound Thy gross material organ cannot hear) Virtue on earth by British Edward crown'd. Her rev'rend throne once more shall rear. To her own self-applauding breast Forc'd for reward no longer to retreat, She sees her aweful charms by kings caress'd, Sees honour woo her for his mate. Honour, her heav'n-elected spouse, From her embrace by lawless pow'r with-held, Now at yon altar plights his holy vows, Vows by assenting Edward seal'd. And now the fair angelic bride Gath'ring her noble train from ev'ry land, To her late wedded lord with decent pride Presents the venerable band. The great procession Edward leads; I see yon hallow'd dome with heroes throng'd: Incessant still the white-plum'd pomp proceeds, Thro' time's eternal course prolong'd. And you, dear partners of my fame, Your ancient honours now again shall boast; This noble order shall retrieve our name, In visionary fables lost. This from our martial board deriv'd, These for our brethren let us proudly own, More pleas'd to view our deeds by thee reviv'd, Then griev'd, great king, to be outdone. Chorus. Hail British prince! these faithful lays Shall reassert thy ancient praise. Nor thee, O Windsor, shall I pass unsung, Mansion of princes, and fit haunt of gods, Who frequent shall desert their bright abodes, To view thy sacred walls with trophies hung: Thy walls by British Arthur first renown'd, The early seat of chivalry and fame; By Edward now with deathless honours crown'd, Illustrious by his birth, his garter, and his name. Genius. Conferring just rewards, most worthy prince, Is the first attribute of sov'reign pow'r, And that which best distinguishes a king: For punishment, and all the nice awards Of civil justice, by the laws are fix'd, And kings but execute what they decree. While in rewarding merit, uncontroul'd, Unguided, unassisted is the hand Of majesty; the prince himself alone There judges, and his wisdom is the law. Well does thy court, great king, with ev'ry worth And ev'ry virtue fill'd, this wisdom shew In thee transcendent: well hast thou approv'd Its force in this great trial, which my pow'r Commanded, in no common ways to prove Thy royal mind.—But that a father's name May not restrain thy justice in the choice Of the first knights-companions of St. George, Myself here take upon me to present A candidate, whom, were he not thy son, Thou wouldst thyself select from all mankind. His modesty compels me to declare That candidate is Edward, prince of Wales. Prince Edward. Inhabitant of heav'n! I not presume To deprecate or question that high will, To which it best becomes me to submit. But, gentle spirit, be propitious to me; And thou, my gracious liege, if I request That this illustrious monarch, whose desert Is equal to the grandeur of his crown, May stand before me in this list of fame. King John. O generous youth! in vain thy goodness strives To raise thy captive thus above his fortune. The king that is not free, is not a king; Nor can thy bounteous favour reconcile Honour and bondage.—To thy conqu'ring son Do thou, great Edward, give this noble mark Of prosp'rous virtue; ill becomes it me, To wear at once thy garter and thy chains. Though by my former dignity I swear, That were I reinstated in my throne, The throne of Capet and of Charlemagne, Thus to be join'd in fellowship with thee, Would be the first ambition of my soul; A ray of glory I would sue to gain, And prize it equal with my diadem. Genius. Wisely thou hast determin'd, worthy prince, For thine and Edward's honour, and hast fix'd Its proper value on his royal gift, Which as the meed of merit, may become The proudest monarchs, by this garter mark'd For something more than monarchs, virtuous men. This be the glory of thy order, Edward. And Besides the great persons of our own nation, that have been admitted of this order, the English reader may be glad to be informed, that in the annals of the Garter are found the names of Charles V. emperor of Germany; of Francis I. and Henry IV. kings of France; and of Gustavus Adolphus king of Sweden. never shall it want the greatest names Of all succeeding times to grace its annals. France, Sweden, Poland, Germany, and Spain, Each realm of Europe's wide-extended bounds, Shall count among thy knights its mightiest lords, And see, in emulation of thy fame, New royal founders of like orders rise. Proceed then, mighty king, and set the world The precedent of glory: thou begin The radiant list of Sov'reigns, while thy son, Like a young bride, that on her nuptial morn Leads on with modest pride the virgin-choir, Herself the brightest, heads the shining band Of knights-companions, nobly seconding His father's glorious deeds with equal fame. Edward. The testimony of heav'n to thee, my son, Thus gloriously accorded, renders vain All farther trial.—To my people's voice, By this their tutelary pow'r declar'd, With pleasure I consent, directing still By theirs my choice, my judgment, my desires. Approach then, my belov'd, my noble son, Strength of my crown, and honour of my realm; In whom my heart more joys, and glories more, Than in the highest pride of sov'reign pow'r. The prince of Wales advances to his father, and kneels; while the king, taking the Garter from the herald, buckles it round his left leg.Thus I admit thee, Edward prince of Wales, First founder of the order of St. George; In evidence whereof, about thy knee I bind this mystic garter; to denote The bond of honour that together ties The brethren of St. George in friendly league, United to maintain the cause of truth And justice only— The sense, and almost the words in the verses of this speech, mark'd thus “are taken from the admonition read to the knights, at the time of their receiving the garter and the ribbon or collar of the order. Vide Ashmole's History of the order of the garter.“May propitious heav'n “Grant thou may'st henceforth wear it to his praise, “The exaltation of this noble order, “And thy own glory.”—With like reverence, My son receive and wear this golden chain, “Grac'd with the image of Britannia's saint, “Heav'n's valiant soldier, Cappadocian George; “In imitation of whose glorious deeds “May'st thou triumphant in each state of life, “Or prosperous or adverse, still subdue “Thy spiritual and carnal enemies; “That not on earth alone thou may'st obtain “The guerdon of thy valour, endless praise, “But with the virtuous and the brave above, “In solemn triumph, wear celestial palms, “To crown thy final noblest victory.” Embraces Pr. Edw. Prince Edward. Accept, my sovereign liege, my grateful thanks, That thou hast thus vouchsaf'd to place thy son First next thyself upon the roll of fame, As he indeed is first in filial love, And emulation of thy royal virtues And may thy benediction, gracious lord, May thy paternal vows be heard in heav'n! That he, whom thou hast listed in the cause Of truth and virtue, never may forget His vow'd engagements, nor defraud thy hopes, By soiling with dishonourable deeds The lustre of that order, which thy name Shou'd teach him to respect and to adorn. ODE. Bards. STROPHE I. Celestial maid! Bright spark of that ætherial flame, Whose vivid spirit thro' all nature spread, Sustains and actuates this boundless frame! O by whatever stile to mortals known, Virtue, benevolence, or public zeal, Divine assessor of the regal throne, Divine protectress of the common weal, O in our hearts thy energy infuse! Be thou our Muse, Celestial maid, And, as of old, impart thy heav'nly aid To those, who warm'd by thy benignant fire, To public merit and their country's good Devoted ever their recording lyre, Wont along Deva's sacred flood, Or, beneath Mona's oak retir'd, To warble forth their patriot lays, And nourish with immortal praise The bright heroic flames by thee inspir'd. ANTISTROPHE I. I feel, I feel Thy soul-invigorating heat; My bounding veins distend with fervent zeal, And to Britannia's fame responsive beat.— Hail Albion, native country! but how chang'd Thy once grim aspect, how adorn'd and gay Thy howling forests! where together rang'd The naked hunter and his savage prey: Where amid black inhospitable woods The sedge-grown floods All cheerless stray'd. Nor in their lonely wand'ring course survey'd, Or tow'r, or castle, heav'n-ascending fane, Or lowly village, residence of peace And joyous industry, or furrow'd plain, Or lowing herd, or silver fleece That whitens now each verdant vale While laden with their precious store Far trading barks to every shore, Swift heralds of Britannia's glory, sail. EPODE I. These are thy shining works: this smiling face Of beauteous nature thus in regal state, Deck'd by each handmaid art, each polish'd grace, That on fair liberty and order wait. This pomp, these riches, this repose, To thee imperial Britain owes. To thee, great substitute of heav'n, To whom the charge of earthly realms was giv'n; Their social systems by wise nature's plan To form and rule by her eternal laws; To teach the selfish soul of wayward man To seek the publick good, and aid the common cause. So didst thou move the mighty heart Of Alfred, founder of the British state: So to Matilda's scepter'd son, To him whose virtue and renown First made the name of Edward great, Thy ample spirit so didst thou impart: Protecting thus in every age, From greedy pow'r and factious rage, The law of freedom, which to Britain's shore From Saxon Elva's many-headed flood, The valiant sons of Odin with them bore, Their national, ador'd, inseparable good. STROPHE II. Runny Mead near Stains, where the Grand Charter was signed by king John.On yonder plain, Along whose willow-fringed side The silver-footed Naiads, sportive train, Down the smooth Thames amid the cygnets glide, I saw, when at thy reconciling word, Injustice, anarchy, intestine jar, Despotick insolence, the wasting sword, And all the brazen throats of civil war, Were hush'd in peace; from his imperious throne Hurl'd furious down, Abash'd, dismay'd, Like a chas'd lion to the savage shade Of his own forests, fell oppression fled, With vengeance brooding in his sullen breast. Then justice fearless rear'd her decent head, Heal'd every grief, each wrong redress'd; While round her valiant squadrons stood, And bade her aweful tongue demand, From vanquish'd John's reluctant hand, The deed of freedom purchas'd with their blood. ANTISTROPHE II. O vain surmise! To deem the grandeur of a crown Consists in lawless pow'r! to deem them wise Who change security and fair renown, For detestation, shame, distrust, and fear! Who, shut for ever from the blissful bow'rs, With horror and remorse at distance hear The musick that inchants th'immortal pow'rs, The heav'nly musick of well-purchas'd praise, Seraphick lays, The sweet reward On heroes, patriots, righteous kings conferr'd. For such alone the heav'n-taught poets sing. Tune ye for Edward, then, the mortal strain, His name shall well become your golden string, Begirt with this ætherial train, Seems he not rank'd among the gods? Then let him reap the glorious meed Due to each great heroic deed, And taste the pleasures of the blest abodes. EPODE II. Hail, happy prince! on whom kind Fate bestows Sublimer joys, and glory brighter far Than Cressy's palm, and every wreath that grows In all the blood-stain'd field of prosp'rous war; Joys that might charm an heav'nly breast, To make dependent millions blest, A dying nation to restore And save fall'n liberty with kingly pow'r; To quench the torch of discord and debate, Relume the languid spark of publick zeal, Repair the breaches of a shatter'd state, And gloriously compleat the plan of England's weal; Compleat the noble Gothick pile, That on the rock of justice rear'd shall stand In symmetry, and strength, and fame, A rival of that boasted frame Which virtue rais'd on Tiber's strand. This, Edward, guardian, father of our isle, This god-like task, to few assign'd, Exalts thee above human-kind, And from the realms of everlasting day Calls down celestial bards thy praise to sing; Calls this bright troop of spirits to survey Thee, the great miracle of earth, a Patriot-King. Genius. Now reascend your skies, immortal spirits! Th'important act, that drew ye down to earth, Is finish'd. Spare we now their mortal sense, That cannot long endure th'unshrouded beam Of higher natures. Well hath Edward laid, Under your happy auspices, the base Of his great Order: let him undisturb'd, But not unaided by the heav'nly powers, Compleat th'illustrious work, which future kings, Struck with the beauty of the noble plan, Shall emulously labour to maintain. And may thy spirit, Edward, be their guide! In every chapter, thou henceforth preside, In every breast infuse thy virtuous flame, And teach them to respect their country's fame. Genius and Spirits reascend to a loud sympony of musick. An Epistle to the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Cornbury. By ? Esq; While you, my Lord, alas! amidst a few, With generous warmth your country's good pursue; While to the center all your wishes tend, Accept the zeal that prompts a willing friend. Others like you heaven's hallow'd spark inspir'd, Whom soon the blaze of selfish passion fir'd, Soon ruder flames extinguish'd reason's light, While prejudices foul'd their jaundic'd sight. Such thro' false opticks every object prove, And try the good and bad, by hate and love. All-powerful means each virtue to supply, All-powerful means each virtue to deny; To Wyndham strength, and grace, and fire, and weight; To Granville parts, to save a sinking state. Hence various judgments form the madden'd throng, Only in this alike, they all are wrong. Hence to false praise shall blame unjust succeed, And cherubs fall, and gods unpity'd bleed. Wou'd you, my friend, not mix the purer flame, Nor lose the patriot in a baser name; Nor factious rage mistake for publick zeal, Nor private int'rest for the gen'ral weal? By truth's sure test let ev'ry deed be try'd, And justice ever be th'unerring guide. Her rules are plain, and easy is her way, And yet how hard to find if once we stray! All lost alike the maze perplex'd we tread, However prompted, whether drove or led; Whether false honour or ambition goad, Or sneaking av'rice wind the miry road, Or whether sway'd by passions not our own, And the weak fear of being right alone. Alone in such a cause is base to fear, Tho' fools suspect, and knaves designing sneer. Sneer, villains, sneer! th'avenging time is nigh, When Balbo scourg'd shall weep the taunting lie; When Stopus foul with each imputed crime, Shall dread false prose repaid with honest rhyme. 'Tis not enough you scorn a private claim, And to your country's good direct your aim. Wrong is still wrong, however great the end, Tho' all the realm were brother, father, friend; Justice regards not these—where right prevails, A nation is an atom in her scales. Heaven means not all the good which man can gain, But that which truth can earn, and right maintain. However fair the tempting prize may be, If guilt the price, it is not meant for thee. Succeeding times may claim the just design, Or other means, or other powers than thine. Each part's connected with the gen'ral plan, The weal of Britain with the weal of man. Justice the scale of interest for the whole, The same in Indies as beneath the pole; Sure rule by which heaven's blessings to dispense, Unerring light of guiding providence. Others may fail.—If wrongly understood, How fatal is the thirst of publick good! No heavier curse almighty vengeance brings, Nor plagues, nor famine, nor the lust of kings. Fir'd by this rage the frantick sons of Rome, The suff'ring world to death and bondage doom; Nations must sink to raise her cumb'rous frame, And millions bleed to eternize her name. But lo! her glories fade, her empire's past, She madly conquer'd but to fall the last. Nor would I here the patriot's views reprove, Or damp the sacred flame of social love. Still may that portion of th'eternal ray Sublime our sense, and animate our clay; Above low self exalt th'immortal frame, And emulate that heaven from whence it came. Oh! would it never be confin'd to place, But beam extensive as the human race: Be, as it was design'd, the world's great soul, Connect its parts, and actuate the whole, So each should think himself a part alone, And for a nation's welfare stake his own! Yet farther still, tho' dearest to the breast, That nation think but part of all the rest. For this let equal justice poise the ball, Her swaying force unites us all to all; Of manners, worship, form, no diff'rence knows, Condemns our friends, and saves our better foes. Confess the heavenly power! nor need you fear Let Britain suffer, while you follow her. Tho' prosp'rous crimes some daring villains raise, Nor life's short date my halting vengeance seize; A nation cannot 'scape—the destin'd rage Pursues her ceaseless to some future age; Speeds the sure ruin from the conqueror's hand, Or spreads corruption o'er a pining land. Ask hoary time, what nation is most blest? For sage experience shall this truth attest: “Where freedom sleeps secure from lawless wrath, “Where commerce shelter'd flows thro' publick faith, “Where fell ambition lights no foreign wars, “Nor discord rages with intestine wars; “Where justice reigns.”—Immortal were that state, If aught immortal here were giv'n by Fate. Such, lost Iberia! were those happy reigns, When liberty sat brooding o'er thy plains. The rich in plenteous peace their stores enjoy'd, By cares unvex'd, by luxury uncloy'd. Hope sooth'd the poor with promises of gain, And paid with future joys their present pain; Shew'd the full bowl amidst their sultry toil, While those who prun'd the olive drank the oil; By night of all the fruits of day possess'd, Labour soft-clos'd the eye, and sweeten'd rest. Such was thy state all gay in nature's smiles! And such is now the state of Britain's isles. Hence o'er the ocean's waste her sail unfurl'd, Wide wafts the tribute of a willing world. Hence trusting nations treasure here their wealth, Safe from tyrannick force or legal stealth: And hence the injur'd exile doom'd to roam, Shall find his country here and dearer home. Still be this truth, this saving truth confess'd, Britain is great, because with freedom blest; Her prince is great, because her people free, And power her springs from publick liberty. Hail mighty monarch of the free and great! Firm on the basis of a prosp'rous state. The wealth, the strength of happy millions thine, United rise, united shall decline. For time will come, sad period of the brave, When Britain's humble prince shall rule the slave; When traffick vile shall stain the guilty throne, And kings shall buy our ruin and their own. But long, O long th'inglorious doom suspend! What virtue gain'd may virtue still defend! Thrice sacred spirit, never may you cease, But as you blaz'd in war, shine forth in peace! Dauntless with all the force of truth engage The headlong tide of each corrupted age. O ever wake around one favour'd throne, Nor let our guardian monarch wake alone! Tho' oft defeated and tho' oft betray'd, Numbers shall rise in sacred freedom's aid. Far as her all-enlivening influence reigns, Heroic ardour beats in gen'rous veins. Now bids learn'd Greece barbarian might defy, Now the soft arts of polish'd tyranny; Now to no stock, or sect, or place confin'd, She takes adopted sons from human kind; While denizen'd by her eternal laws, They all are Britons who shall serve her cause. Lo! to the banner crowds a youthful band; Form'd for the glorious task by nature's hand; Wisdom unclogg'd by years, with toil unbought, A zeal by vigour kindled, rul'd by thought. Such gifts she to the happy few imparts, To judging heads and to determin'd hearts; To heads unfir'd by youth's tumultuous rage, To hearts unnumb'd by the chill ice of age; And while they both preserve a sep'rate claim, Their passions reason, and their reasons flame. Proceed brave youths! Let others court renown In hostile fields, be yours the olive crown: And trust to fame, those heroes brighter shone Who sav'd a nation, than who nations won. Nor let assuming age restrain your flight, Fearful to tempt the yet unpractis'd height; Deceitful counsel lurks in hoary hairs, And the last dregs of life are sordid cares. Objects are clear proportion'd in degree, To gen'ral use, or strong necessity, Nor are two things so plainly understood, As the worst evil and the greatest good; If rescu'd from the misty breath of schools; Men will but feel without the help of rules. So unbewilder'd in the crooked maze, Where guilt low sculks, and reptile cunning strays, A nation's interest, and a people's rights, Distinctly shine in nature's simple rights, And claim in him who fairly acts his part, Before a Lonsdale's head, a Lonsdale's heart. But chief when snatch'd by heaven's preserving hand, From the fell contests of each hostile land, A happy island to th'incircling main Trusts for a sure report and honest gain. The just are heaven's, earth is for heaven ordain'd, Form'd by its laws, and by its laws maintain'd. These one true int'rest, one great system frame, Political and moral are the same. Guilt toils for gain at honour's vast expence, Heaven throws the trifle in to innocence; And fixes happiness in hell's despite, The necessary consequence of right. Proceed, ye deists! blindfold rage employ, And prove the sacred truths ye would destroy. Prove christian faith the wisest scheme to bind, In chains of cordial love, our jarring kind; And thence conclude it human, if you can, The perfect produce of imperfect man! While prostrate we adore that pow'r divine, Whose simple rule connects each great design; Bids social earth a type of heaven appear, Where justice tastes those joys which wait her there. But tho' self-int'rest follow virtue's train! Yet selfish think not virtue's end is gain! Older than time, ere int'rest had a name, Justice existed, and is still the same; Alike the creature's and creator's guide, His rule to form, the law by which we're ty'd: In reason's light, eternal word, express'd, Stamp'd with his image in the creature's breast. Thus speaks the sage, who skill'd in nature's laws, Deep from effects high-trac'd th'all-ruling cause. “Before creation was, th'almighty mind “In time's abyss the future world design'd; “Did the great system in its parts survey, “And fit the springs, and regulate their play; “In meet gradations plan'd th'harmonious round, “These links by which depending parts are bound. “All these he knew, ere yet the things he made, “In types which well the mimick world display'd. “The types are real, since from them he drew “The real forms of whatsoe'er we view. “Made to their 'semblance, heaven and earth exist, “But they unmade eternally subsist. “For if created, we must sure suppose “Some other types whence their resemblance flows; “While these on others equally depend, “Nor ever shall the long progression end. “God ere it was, the future being saw, “Or blindfold made his world, and gave his law. “But chance cou'd never frame the vast design, “Where countless parts in justest order join. “The types eternal just proportions teach, “Greater or less, more or less perfect each. “These ever present power omniscient sees, “On them he forms his ever-made decrees; “Nor can he better love what merits least, “Man than an angel, or than man a beast. “Hence Reason, hence immortal Order springs, “Knowledge and Love adapted to the things, “And thence th'unerring rule of justice flows, “To act what Order prompts, and Reason shows. “What man in nature's purity remain'd, “By pain untroubled, and by sin unstain'd; “Fair image of the God, and close conjoin'd, “By innate union with the heavenly mind; “In the pure splendor of substantial light, “The beam divine of Reason bless'd his sight; “Seraphick Order in its fount he view'd, “Seeing he lov'd, and loving he pursu'd; “Nor dar'd the body, passive slave, controul “The sovereign mandates of the ruling soul. “But soon by sin the sacred union broke, “Man bows to earth beneath the heavy yoke. “The darkling soul scarce feels a glimm'ring ray, “Shrouded in sense from her immortal day. “Vengeance divine offended Order arms, “And cloaths in terrors her celestial charms. “Now grosser objects heav'n-born souls possess, “Passions enslave, and servile cares oppress. “Fraud, rapine, murder, guilt's long horrid train, “Distracted nature's anarchy maintain. “No more pure Reason earthly minds can move, “No more can Order's charms persuasive prove. “But as the moon reflecting borrowed day, “Sheds on our shadow'd world a feeble ray; “Some scatter'd beams of Reason law contains, “While Order's rule must be inforc'd by pains. “Hence death's black scroll, dire tortures hence are giv'n; “Hence kings, the necessary curse of heaven. “And just the doom of an avenging God, “Who spurn'd his scepter, feel the tyrant's rod. “Blind by our fears we meet the ills we fly, “In rule oppression, want in property.” So spoke the sage, and if not learn'd in vain, If spotless truth in sacred books remain; Dearly the child hath paid the parent's pride, And ill hath Law the heavenly rule supply'd. Thus boasts some leech with unavailing art, To mend the tainted lungs and wasting heart; Bids the loose springs with wonted vigour play, And sprightly juices warm in cold decay. Or wou'd imperious reason deign to own, The world not made for sovereign man alone; Some things there are for human use design'd, And these in common dealt to human kind. To mortal wants is giv'n a power to use, What to th'immortal part just heaven might well refuse. This faithful instinct in each breast implants, All know their rights, for all must feel their wants. But soon began the rage of wild desire, To thirst for more than use could e'er require. Ere stung by luxury's unsated call, And ere ambition madly grasp'd the ball, Vain restless man in busy search employ'd, Saw somewhat still beyond the bliss enjoy'd, Press'd eager on; the lowly and the great, Alike their wish beyond their destin'd state; Alike condemn'd, whatever Fortune grant, To real poorness in phantastic want. And now some sages high by others deem'd, For virtue honour'd, and for parts esteem'd; Call'd forth to judge where dubious claims are try'd, Convince with reason, and with counsel guide; Fix'd rules devise to sway th'assenting throng, And marks distinct impress on right and wrong. The simple precept subtle wiles invade, And statutes as our crimes increas'd were made, These were at first unwritten, plain and few, 'Till swell'd by time the law's vast volume grew; And grown with these, to sway th'unwieldy trust, Thousands we chose to keep the millions just, Some plac'd o'er others, others plac'd o'er these, Thus government grew up by slow degrees; Higher the pile arose, and still more high, When lo! the summit ends in monarchy. There plac'd, a man in gorgeous pomp appears, And far o'er earth his tow'ring aspect rears; While prostrate crowds his sacred smile implore, And what their crimes had form'd, their fears adore. Low from beneath they lift their servile eyes, And see the proud colossus touch the skies. So at some mountain's foot have children gaz'd, While close to heaven they view the summit rais'd, Eager they mount, new regions to explore, But heaven is now as distant as before. Thus views the crowd a throne, while those who rise Claim not a nearer kindred to the skies; Earth is their parent, thither kings should bend, From thence they rise, and not from heaven descend. Happy, had all the royal sons of earth Thus sprung, nor guilt had claim'd the monstrous birth. Where from the sire descending thro' the line, Rapine and fraud confer a right divine. Ye mortal gods, how vainly are ye proud? If just your title, servants to the crowd; If wide your sway, if large your treasur'd store, These but increase your servitude the more; A part is only yours, the rest is theirs, And nothing all your own, except your cares. Shall man, by nature free, by nature made To share the feast her bounteous hand display'd, Transfer these rights? as well he may dispense The beam of reason, or the nerve of sense; With all his strength the monarch's limbs invest, Or pour his valour in the royal breast. Take the starv'd peasant's taste, devouring lord! Ere you deprive him of the genial board. And if you wou'd his liberty controul, Assume the various actings of his soul! So shall one man a people's powers enjoy, Thus Indians deem of wretches they destroy. Thus in old tales the fabled monster stands, Proud of a thousand eyes, a thousand hands. Thus dreams the sophist, who with subtle art Wou'd prove the whole included in a part, A people in their king; and from the throng, Transfer to him their rights in nature's wrong; Those sacred rights in nature's charter plain, By wants that claim them, and by powers that gain. Tho' sophists err, yet stand confess'd thy claim, And be the king and multitude the same, Whose deeds benevolent his title prove, And royal selfishness, in publick love; Nor, draining wasted realms for sordid pelf, O scepter'd suicide! destroy thy self. Where fails this proof, in vain would we unite The ruler's int'rest with the people's right. Frantick ambition has her sep'rate claim, The dropsy'd thirst of empire, wealth, or fame; Pride's boundless hope, valour's enthusiast rant, With the long nameless train of fancy'd want. Urg'd on by these, all view the magick prize, The prospect widening as they higher rise; For him who seeks a limited command, To him whose wish devours air, sea, and land. Alike all foes to freedom's holy cause, For freedom ties unbounded will with laws, Alike all foes to ev'ry publick gain, For publick blessings loose the bond-man's chain. Ill-fated slaves of arbitrary sway! Where trusted power seduces to betray; Makes private failings rage a gen'ral pest, And taints even virtue in the social breast; Bids friendship plunder, charity undo The blameless many, for the favour'd few. 'Till guilt high rear'd on crimes protecting crime, Fills the heap'd measure of predestin'd time. Far others, ye, O wealthy, wise, and brave! Tho' subject, free; more freedom wou'd enslave. Bless'd with a rule by long experience try'd, Unwarp'd by faction's rage, or kingly pride; Bless'd with the means, whene'er this rule shall bend, Again to trace it to its glorious end; And bless'd with proofs, the proofs are seal'd with blood, Whate'er the form, the end is publick good. But yet admit the sire his right fore-goes! Can he his children's separate claim dispose? Whate'er the parent gave, whate'er he give, They who have right to life, have right to live. And spite of man's consent, or man's decree, A right to life, is right to liberty. Tho' for convenience fram'd the laws should shine, Pure emanation from the source divine; Such as can pierce the gloom of pagan night, And untaught savages in woods enlight; Such as on scaffolds can the guiltless save, And torture on his throne the scepter'd slave; Such as th'offending wretch reluctant owns, And hails its beauty with his dying groans: In such fair laws the will of heaven impress'd, Shines to all eyes, and rules the conscious breast. Tho' tortures cease, tho' night's thick-mantling vail From mortal ken the secret deed conceal; Reason and conscience shall awake within, And light the shade, and loud proclaim the sin. “But should the universal voice combine, “To cloath injustice in a robe divine?” Let the same breath divest the day of light, To blazon forth the dusky face of night. Then shall the laws of sainted evil bind, And human will subvert th'all-ruling mind; That sacred fount whence lawful rule must spring, And diff'rent from the robber marks the king. Yet vainly wou'd despotick will conclude, That force may sway the erring multitude, Justice, 'tis own'd, should ever guide the free, But pow'r of wrong, in all, is liberty; And for whatever purposes restrain'd, A nation is enslav'd that may be chain'd. Heaven gives to all a liberty of choice, A people's good requires a people's voice; Man's surest guide, where diff'rent views agree, From private hate, and private int'rest free. Fatal their change from such who rashly fly, To the hard grasp of guiding tyranny; Soon shall they find, when will is arm'd with might, Injustice wield the sword, tho' drawn for right. Blind to these truths who fond of boundless sway, Bids trembling slaves implicitly obey; Tho' by a long descent from Adam down Thro' scepter'd heirs, he boasts his ancient crown, Great nature's rebel forfeits ev'ry claim, And loads the tyrant with th'usurper's name; While with each lawless act of proud command, He stands proscrib'd by his own guilty hand. Bow, Filmer, bow! to hell's tremendous throne, And bid thy fellow-damn'd suppress each groan! There sits a king whom pow'r divine hath giv'n, Nor earth boasts one so surely sent from heav'n. And thou, blest martyr in fair freedom's cause, Thou great asserter of thy country's laws; Vainly oppression stopp'd thy potent breath; Truth shone more powerful thro' the vail of death; Example mov'd whom precept cou'd not save, And lifted axes wak'd each drowsy slave. Yet magistrates must rule, they're useful things, Our guilt the vengeance, and avenger brings. Whate'er more perfect heaven might first create, A state well-governed, now, is nature's state; For law from reason springs, spontaneous fruit, And reason sure is man's first attribute. Let visionary schoolmen toil in vain, Who seek in anarchy for nature's reign; Wretched alike the slaves of lawless will, Whether the savage, or the tyrant kill; Unjust alike all rule, where publick choice Speaks not thro' laws a willing people's voice. Nor freedom suffers when the guilty fall, 'Tis nature's doom, 'tis self-defence in all. Such now is man deprav'd that fear must sway, To tread the paths where duty points the way; The wretch must suffer to forewarn the rest, And some must fall to stop the spreading pest. Alone the gen'ral welfare can demand The bleeding victim from th'unwilling hand. Hence publick pains—what to the crime is due, O Judge supreme! must be reserv'd for you. To you alone, whose all-pervading eye Deep in the breast can latent thought espy; Try ev'ry action by the known intent, And to each crime adapt its punishment; While men, misled by erring lights, dispense The doom of guilt to injur'd innocence; Or tho' repentance cleanse the moral stain, Inflict on crimes atton'd avenging pain. Yet blameless they who act sincere their part, Faultless he errs who cannot read the heart. Not such fierce flames the mad enthusiast's zeal, On errors harmless to the gen'ral weal, Whether false notions wander far from truth, Or age retain'd the trace impress'd in youth. While int'rest prompts the holy murd'rer's hand, In sacred fires to light th'unhallow'd brand; To draw destruction from heaven's saving page, And bid sweet mercy breathe relentless rage. Accurs'd all such! and he with joy elate, Whose baleful breath embitters certain fate; Who on th'imploring face malignant smiles, And sentenc'd wretches wantonly reviles. Better, far better in the savage den, Let the robb'd lion judge o'er prostrate men: Better let pow'r the lawless faulchion draw, Than coward cruelty disgrace the law. This well you know, O—! whose righteous seat Gives to the innocent a sure retreat; Severely just, and piously humane, The wretch you punish, while you share his pain. Tears with the dreadful words of sentence flow, Nor does the rigid judge the man forego. So feels the breast humane, ye truly brave! And such is thine, my friend, intent to save! Whether thy bounty pining want relieve, Or lenient pity sooth the hearts that grieve; Whether thy pious hand due bounds prescribe To little tyrants, o'er the lesser tribe; Or whether noble warmth expand thy soul, And huge leviathan unaw'd controul. Nor Britain only claims thy gen'rous plan, Thy rule is justice, and thy care is man. And may this truth thy fair example prove, Justice shall fan the flame of social love. An EPISTLE. By the Same. [Thro' the wild maze of life's still varying plan] Thro' the wild maze of life's still varying plan, Bliss is alone th'important task of man. All else is trifling, whether grave or gay, A Newton's labours, or an infant's play; Whether this vainly wastes th'unheeded sun, Or those more vainly mark the course it run; For of the two, sure smaller is the fault, To err unthinking, than to err with thought; But if, like them, we still must trifles use, Harmless at least, like theirs, be those we chuse. Enough it is that reason blames the choice, Join not to her's the wretch's plaintive voice; Be folly free from guilt: let foplings play, Or write, or talk, or dress, or die away. Let those, if such there be, whose giant-mind Superior tow'rs above their pigmy kind, Unaided and alone, the realms explore, Where hail and snow renew their treasur'd store. Job, chap. xxxviii. Lo! heav'n spreads all its stars; let those explain, What balanc'd pow'rs the rolling orb sustain; Nor in more humble scales, pernicious weigh Sense, justice, truth, against seducing pay. So distant regions shall employ their thought, And spotless senates here remain unbought. Well had great Charles V. Emperor of Germany, who in his retirement amus'd himself with puppets. See Strada de bello Belgico. Charles, by early want inspir'd, With warring puppets, guiltless praise acquir'd; So wou'd that flame have mimick fights engag'd, Which fann'd by pow'r, o'er wasted nations rag'd. Curs'd be the wretch, should all the mouths of fame Wide o'er the world his deathless deeds proclaim, Who like a baneful comet spreads his blaze, While trembling crowds in stupid wonder gaze; Whose potent talents serve his lawless will, Which turns each virtue to a publick ill, With direful rage perverted might employs, And heav'n's great ends with heav'n's best means destroys, The praise of power is his, whose hand supplies Fire to the bold, and prudence to the wise; While man this only real merit knows, Fitly to use the gifts which heaven bestows: If savage valour be his vaunted fame, The mountain-lion shall dispute his claim: Or, if perfidious wiles deserve applause, Thro' slighted vows, and violated laws; The subtle plotter's title stands confess'd, Whose dagger gores the trusting tyrant's breast. And sure the villain less deserves his fate, Who stabs one wretch, than he who stabs a state. Now, mighty hero! boast thy dear delights, The price of toilsome days and sleepless nights: Say, canst thou aught in purple grandeur find, Sweet as the slumbers of the lowly hind? Better are ye, the youthful and the gay, Who jocund rove thro' pleasure's flow'ry way! Yet seek not there for bliss! your toil were vain, (And disappointed toil is double pain) Tho' from the living fount your nectar-bowls Pour the soft balm upon your thirsty souls; Tho' pure the spring, tho' every draught sincere, By pain unbitter'd, and unpall'd by fear; Tho' all were full as high as thought can soar, Till fancy fires, and wishes crave no more: Let lovely woman artless charms display, Where truth and goodness bask in beauty's ray; Let heavn'ly melody luxuriant float In swelling sounds, and breathe the melting note; Let gen'rous wines enliv'ning thoughts inspire, While social converse sooths the genial fire: If aught can yet more potent charms dispense, Some stronger rapture, some sublimer sense; Be these enjoy'd.—Then from the crowd arise Some chief, in life's full pride maturely wise. Ev'n you, my Lord, with titles, honours grac'd, And higher still by native merit plac'd; By stinted talents to no sphere confin'd, Free ranging every province of the mind: Equally fit, a nation's weight to bear, Or shine in circles of the young and fair; In grave debates instructed senates move, Or melt the glowing dame to mutual love. To heighten these, let conscious worth infuse Sweet ease, and smiling mirth th'inspiring Muse. Then answer, thou of ev'ry gift possess'd, Say, from thy soul, art thou sincerely blest! To various subjects wherefore dost thou range? Pleasure must cease, ere man can wish to change. Hast thou not quitted Flaccus' sacred lay, To talk with Bavius, or with Flavia play; When wasted nature shuns the large expence Of deep attention to exalted sense! Precarious bliss! which soon, which oft must cloy, And which how few, how very few enjoy! Say, is there aught, on which, completely blest, Fearless and full the raptur'd mind may rest? Is there aught constant? Or, if such there be, Can varying man be pleas'd with constancy? Mark then what sense the blessing must employ! The senses change, and loath accustom'd joy: Eden in vain immortal sweets displays, If the taste sickens, or our frame decays. The range of life contracted limits bound; Yet more confin'd is pleasure's faithless round: Fair op'ning to the sight, when first we run, But, ah! how alter'd, when again begun! When tir'd we view the same known prospect o'er, And lagging, tread the steps we trod before. Now clogg'd with spleen, the lazy current flows, Thro' doubts, and fears, and self-augmenting woes; Till sated, loathing, hopeless here of bliss, Some plunge to seek it into death's abyss. Of all superfluous wealth's unnumber'd stings, The sharpest is that knowledge which it brings; Enjoyment purchas'd makes its object known, And then, alas! each soft illusion's flown: Love's promis'd sweet, ambition's lofty scheme, The painter's image, and the poet's theme. These, in perspective fair exalted high, Attract with seeming charms the distant eye; But when by envious Fortune plac'd too near, Mis-shapen forms, and grosser tints appear: Where lovely Venus led her beauteous train, Some fiend gigantic holds her monstrous reign; Crowns, scepters, laurels are confus'dly strow'd, A wild, deform'd, unmeaning, heavy load. Some pleasures here with sparing hand are giv'n, That sons of earth should taste their promis'd heav'n: But what was meant to urge us to the chace, Now stops, or sideway turns our devious race: Tho' still to make the destin'd course more plain, Thick are our erring paths beset with pain; Nor has one object equal charms to prove The fitting center of our restless love. And when the great Creator's will had join'd, Unequal pair! the body and the mind, Lest the proud spirit should neglect her clay, He bad corporeal objects thought convey; Each strong sensation to the soul impart Ecstatic transport or afflicting smart: By that entic'd, the useful she enjoys; By this deterr'd, she flies whate'er destroys: Hence from the dagger's point sharp anguish flows, And the soft couch is spread with sweet repose. In something frail, tho' gen'ral this design, For some exceptions ev'ry rule confine: Yet few were they, while nature's genuine store Supply'd our wants, nor man yet sought for more; Ere diff'rent mixtures left no form the same, And vicious habits chang'd our sickly frame. Now subtle art may gild the venom'd pill, And bait with soothing sweets destructive ill. To narrow self heav'n's impulse unconfin'd Diffusive reigns, and takes in all our kind. The smile of joy reflected joy imparts; The wretch's groans pierce sympathizing hearts. Yet not alike are all conjoin'd with all, Nor throng with rival heat to nature's call: By varying instinct different ties are known, While love superior points to each his own; Those next the reach of our assisting hands, And those to whom we're link'd by kindred bands; Those who most want, and best deserve our care, In warmer streams the sacred influence share; Ambrosial sweets her infant's lip distils, While through the mother's heart quick rapture thrills. The social fires friend, servant, neighbour claim, Which blaze collected in the patriot's flame: Hence Britain throbs superior in thy soul, Nor idly wak'st thou for the distant pole. Yet farther still the saving instinct moves, And to the future wide extends our loves; Glows in our bosom for an unborn race, And warms us mutual to the kind embrace, For this, to man was giv'n the graceful air; For this, was woman form'd divinely fair. But now to pleasure sensual views confin'd, Reach not the use, for which it was design'd; To this one point our hopes, our wishes tend, And thus mistake the motive for the end. Whate'er sensations from enjoyment flow, Our erring thought to matter's force would owe; To that ascribe our pleasures and our pains, And blindly for the cause mistake the means; In od'rous meads the vernal gale we praise, Or dread the storm, that blows the wintry seas; While he's unheeded, who alone can move, Claims all our fears, and merits all our love; Alone to souls can sense and thought convey, Thro' the dark mansions of surrounding clay. Man, part from heav'n, and part from humble earth, A motley substance, takes his various birth; Close link'd to both, he hangs in diff'rent chains, The pliant fetter length'ning as he strains. If, bravely conscious of her native fires, To the bold height his nobler frame aspires; Near as she soars to join th'approaching skies, Our earth still lessens to her distant eyes. But if o'erpois'd she sinks, her downward course Each moment weighs, with still augmenting force; Low and more low, the burden'd spirit bends, While weaker still each heav'nly link extends; Till prostrate, grov'ling, fetter'd to the ground, She lies in matter's heap o'erwhelm'd and bound. Wrapt in the toils of sin, just heav'n employs What caus'd her guilt, to blast her lawless joys: Love, potent guardian of our length'ning race, Unnerves the feeble lecher's cold embrace; And appetite, by nature giv'n to save, Sinks the gorg'd glutton in his early grave. What sends yon fleet o'er boist'rous seas to roll, Beneath the burning line, and frozen pole? Why ravage men the hills, the plains, the woods? Why spoil all nature, earth, and air, and floods? Seek they some prize to help a sinking state, No!—this must all be done, ere A Frenchman render'd famous by a most extravagant expence in eating. Bernard eat. Tell it some untaught savage! with surprize He asks, “How vast must be that giant's size! “How great his pow'r, who thousands can employ? “How great his force, who millions can destroy?” But if the savage would, more curious, know What potent virtues from such viands flow, What blest effects they cause—consult with Sloane, Let him explain the colick, gout, and stone! Pleasure's for use; it differs in degree, Proportion'd to the thing's necessity. Hence various objects variously excite, And diff'rent is the date of each delight; But when th'allotted end we once attain, Each step beyond it, is a step to pain. Nor let us murmur.—Hath not earth a store For ev'ry want? it was not meant for more. Blest is the man, as far as earth can bless, Whose measur'd passions reach no wild excess; Who, urg'd by nature's voice, her gifts enjoys, Nor other means, than nature's force, employs. While warm with youth the sprightly current flows, Each vivid sense with vig'rous rapture glows; And when he droops beneath the hand of age, No vicious habit stings with fruitless rage; Gradual, his strength, and gay sensations cease, While joys tumultuous sink in silent peace. Far other is his lot, who, not content With what the bounteous care of nature meant, With labour'd skill would all her joys dilate, Sublime their sense, and lengthen out their date; Add, blend, compose, each various mixture try, And wind up appetite to luxury. Thus guilty art unknown desires implants, And viler arts must satisfy their wants; When to corruption by himself betray'd, Gold blinds the slave, whom luxury has made. The hand, that form'd us, must some use intend, It gives us pow'rs proportion'd to that end; And happiness may justly be defin'd, A full attainment of the end design'd. Virtue and wisdom this alike implies, And blest must be the virtuous and the wise. Bliss is ordain'd for all, since heav'n intends All beings should attain their destin'd ends: For this the fair idea shines confess'd To ev'ry mind, and glows in ev'ry breast. Compar'd with this, all mortal joys are vain; Inspir'd by this, we restless onward strain. High tho' we mount, the objects mount more high, Eludes our grasp, and mingles with the sky. With nothing less th'aspiring soul's content, For nothing less her gen'rous flame was meant; Th'unerring rule, which all our steps should guide, The certain test, by which true good is try'd. Blest when we reach it, wretched while we miss, Our joys, our sorrows prove, there must be bliss. Nor can this be some visionary dream, Where heated fancy forms the flatt'ring scheme. There sure is bliss—else, why by all desir'd? What guileful pow'r has the mad search inspir'd? Could accident produce in all the same, Or a vain shadow raise a real flame? When nature in the world's distended space, Or fill'd, or almost fill'd each smaller place; Careful in meanest matter to produce Each single motion for some certain use; Hard was the lot of her first fav'rite, man, Faulty the scheme of his contracted span, If that alone must know an useless void, And he feel longings ne'er to be enjoy'd. That only can produce consummate joy, Which equals all the pow'rs it would employ; Such fitting object to each talent giv'n, Earth cannot fit what was design'd for heav'n. Why then is man with gifts sublimest fraught, And active will and comprehensive thought? For what is all this waste of mental force? What! for a house, a coach, a dog, a horse? Has nature's lord inverted nature's plan? Is man now made for what was made for man? There must be pleasures past the reach of sense, Some nobler source must happiness dispense: Reason, arise! and vindicate thy claim, Flash on our minds the joy-infusing flame; Pour forth the fount of light, whose endless store Thought drinks insatiate, while it thirsts for more. And thou, seraphick flame! who would'st inspire The prophet's voice, and wrap his soul in fire; Ray of th'eternal beam! who canst pervade The distant past, and future's gloomy shade; While trembling reason tempts heav'n's dazzling height, Sublime her force, and guide her dubious flight; Strengthen'd by thee, she bears the streaming blaze, And drinks new light from truth's immortal rays. Great, only evidence of things divine! By thee reveal'd, the mystick wonders shine! What puzzled sophists vainly would explore, What humbled pride in silence must adore, What plainly mark'd in heav'n's deliver'd page, Makes the taught hind more wise than Greece's sage. Yet reason proves thee in her low degree, And owns thy truths, from their necessity. Conspicuous now is happiness display'd, Possessing him for whom alone we're made. For he alone all human bliss compleats, To him alone th'expanding bosom beats; Who fills each faculty, each pow'r can move, Exerts all thought, and deep absorbs all love; Whose ceaseless being years would tell in vain, Whose attributes immense all bounds disdain. No sickly taste the heav'nly rapture cloys, Nor wearied senses sink in whelming joys While, rais'd above low matter's grosser frame, Pure spirit blazes in his purer flame. Such are th'immortal blessings that attend The just and good, the patriot and the friend. Nor such alone in distant prospect cheer, They taste heav'n's joys anticipated here. These in the smiling cups of pleasure flow, Or, mingling, sooth the bitter stream of woe; These pay the loss of honours, and of place, And teach that guilt alone is true disgrace; These with the glorious exile cheerful rove, And, far from courts, fresh bloom in Curio's grove. Long may such bliss, by such enjoy'd, attest, The greatly virtuous are the greatly blest! Enough there are amidst yon gorgeous train, Who, wretched, prove all other joys are vain. So shines the truth these humble lines unfold, “Fair virtue ever is unwisely sold.” Too mean a price sublimest fortune brings, Too mean the wealth, the smiles, the crowns of kings For rais'd o'er these, she makes our bliss secure, The present pleasing, and the future sure. While prosp'rous guilt a sad reverse appears, And in the tasteless now, the future fears. An EPISTLE to a LADY. By the Same. Clarinda, dearly lov'd, attend The counsels of a faithful friend; Who with the warmest wishes fraught, Feels all, at least, that friendship ought. But since by ruling heav'n's design, Another's fate shall influence thine; O! may these lines for him prepare A bliss, which I wou'd die to share! Man may for wealth or glory roam, But woman must be blest at home; To this shou'd all her studies tend, This her great object and her end. Distaste unmingled pleasures bring, And use can blunt affliction's sting; Hence perfect bliss no mortals know, And few are plung'd in utter woe; While nature arm'd against despair, Gives pow'r to mend, or strength to bear; And half the thought content may gain, Which spleen employs to purchase pain. Trace not the fair domestick plan, From what you wou'd, but what you can! Nor, peevish, spurn the scanty score, Because you think you merit more! Bliss ever differs in degree, Thy share alone is meant for thee; And thou should'st think, however small, That share enough, for 'tis thy all: Vain scorn will aggravate distress, And only make that little less. Admit whatever trifles come, Units compose the largest sum: O! tell them o'er, and say how vain Are those which form ambition's train: Which swell the monarch's gorgeous state, And bribe to ill the guilty great! But thou more blest, more wise than these, Shalt build up happiness on ease. Hail sweet Content! where joy serene Gilds the mild soul's unruffled scene: And with blith fancy's pencil wrought, Spreads the white web of flowing thought; Shines lovely in the cheerful face, And cloaths each charm with native grace; Effusion pure of bliss sincere, A vestment for a god to wear. Far other ornaments compose The garb that shrouds dissembled woes, Piec'd out with motley dies and sorts, Freaks, whimsies, festivals and sports; The troubled mind's fantastick dress, Which madness titles happiness. While the gay wretch to revel bears The pale remains of sighs and tears; And seeks in crowds, like her undone, What only can be found in one. But, chief, my gentle friend! remove Far from thy couch seducing love! O! shun the false magician's art, Nor trust thy yet unguarded heart! Charm'd by his spells fair honour flies, And thousand treach'rous phantoms rise Where guilt in beauty's ray beguiles, And ruin lurks in friendship's smiles. Lo! where th'enchanted captive dreams Of warbling groves, and purling streams; Of painted meads, of flowers that shed Their odours round her fragrant bed. Quick shifts the scene, the charm is lost, She wakes upon a desert coast! No friendly hand to lend its aid, No guardian bow'r to spread its shade; Expos'd to ev'ry chilling blast, She treads th'inhospitable waste; And down the drear decline of life, Sinks a forlorn, dishonour'd wife. Neglect not thou the voice of Fame, But clear from crime, be free from blame! Tho' all were innocence within, 'Tis guilt to wear the garb of sin. Virtue rejects the foul disguise: None merit praise who praise despise. Slight not, in supercilious strain, Long practis'd modes, as low or vain! The world will vindicate their cause, And claim blind faith in custom's laws. Safer with multitudes to stray, Than tread alone a fairer way; To mingle with the erring throng, Than boldly speak ten millions wrong. Beware of the relentless train Who forms adore, whom forms maintain! Lest prudes demure, or coxcombs loud, Accuse thee to the partial crowd; Foes who the laws of honour slight, A judge who measures guilt by spite. Behold the sage Aurelia stand, Disgrace and fame at her command! As if heaven's delegate design'd, Sole arbiter of all her kind. Whether she try some favour'd piece, By rules devis'd in ancient Greece; Or whether modern in her flight, She tells what Paris thinks polite. For much her talents to advance, She study'd Greece, and travell'd France. There learn'd the happy art to please, With all the charms of labour'd ease; Thro' looks and nods with meaning fraught, To teach what she was never taught. By her each latent spring is seen, The workings foul of secret spleen; The guilt that sculks in fair pretence, Or folly veil'd in specious sense. And much her righteous spirit grieves, When worthlessness the world deceives; Whether the erring crowd commends Some patriot sway'd by private ends; Or husband trust a faithless wife, Secure in ignorance from strife. Averse she brings their deeds to view, But justice claims the rig'rous due; Humanely anxious to produce At least some possible excuse. O ne'er may virtue's dire disgrace Prepare a triumph for the base! Mere forms the fool implicit sway, Which witlings with contempt survey, Blind folly no defect can see, Half wisdom views but one degree; The wise remoter uses reach, Which judgment and experience teach. Whoever wou'd be pleas'd and please, Must do what others do with ease. Great precept undefin'd by rule, And only learn'd in custom's school; To no peculiar form confin'd, It spreads thro' all the human kind; Beauty and wit and worth supplies, Yet graceful in the good and wise. Rich with this gift and none beside, In fashion's stream how many glide? Secure from ev'ry mental woe, From treach'rous friend or open foe; From social sympathy that shares The publick loss or private cares; Whether the barb'rous foe invade, Or merit pine in fortune's shade. Hence gentle Anna ever gay, The same to-morrow as to-day, Save where perchance, when others weep, Her cheek the decent sorrow steep; Save when perhaps a melting tale, O'er ev'ry tender breast prevail. The good, the bad, the great, the small, She likes, she loves, she honours all. And yet if sland'rous malice blame, Patient she yields a sister's fame. Alike if satire or if praise, She says whate'er the circle says; Implicit does whate'er we do, Without one point or wish in view, Sure test of others, faithful glass Thro' which the various phantoms pass. Wide blank, unfeeling when alone, No care, no joy, no thought her own. Not thus succeeds the peerless dame, Who looks, and talks, and acts for fame; Intent, so wide her cares extend, To make the universe her friend. Now with the gay in frolick shines, Now reasons deep with deep divines. With courtiers now extols the great, With patriots sighs o'er Britain's fate. Now breathes with zealots holy fires, Now melts in less refin'd desires. Doom'd to exceed in each degree, Too wise, too weak, too proud, too free, Too various for one single word, The high sublime of deep absurd. While ev'ry talent nature grants, Just serves to shew how much she wants. Altho' in—combine The virtues of our sex and thine: Her hand restrains the widow's tears, Her sense informs, and sooths and cheers; Yet like an angel in disguise, She shines but to some favour'd eyes; Nor is the distant herd allow'd To view the radiance thro' the cloud. But thine is ev'ry winning art, Thine is the friendly honest heart: And shou'd the gen'rous spirit flow, Beyond where prudence fears to go; Such sallies are of nobler kind, Than virtues of a narrow mind. An EPISTLE to Mr. POPE. By the Same. Heaven in the human breast implants Fit appetites for all our wants; With hunger prompts to strength'ning food, With love of praise to publick good; These to their object straight convey, While reason winds her tardy way. Yet in one center should unite, Faith, instinct, reason, appetite: One perfect plan ordain'd to trace, And nature dignify with grace; In one great system meant to roll, To move, support, and guide the whole. But some there are who rigid blame The mind that thirsts for righteous fame; And with weak lights presumptuous scan The springs which move predestin'd man. And some there are, accurs'd their art, Tho' all the nine their charms impart, Who in false forms of great and just, Cloath av'rice, treachery, rage and lust: As if superior beings suit Those attributes which sink the brute. But vainly chime the partial lays, Chaste Fame rejects all spurious praise. She, fairest offspring of the skies, The goddess of the brave and wise, Whose sacred impulse prompts the best To succour and preserve the rest, Is deaf to ev'ry private call, And wakes but at the voice of all. From heaps of ill-collected gain, From hecatombs by heroes slain, From courts where guilty greatness dwells, She flys to penury and cells; With Erskine, pious exile, goes, To sooth a drooping father's woes; Or mingling with the orphan-train, She sings the bounties of Germain. Nor pow'r, nor policy of state, Can ever give intrinsick weight: And shou'd fallacious art display O'er titled dross a golden ray, Still baser thro' detecting years, The speckled counterfeit appears. But when from proof, far issuing forth, The ore asserts its native worth; Then, sov'reign bard, 'tis justly thine To stamp the well-attested coin; And consecrated with thy name, To treasure in the stores of Fame. EPISTLE to POLLIO, from the Hills of Howth in Ireland. By the Same. Pollio! would'st thou condescend Here to see thy humble friend, Far from doctors, potions, pills, Drinking health on native hills; Thou the precious draught may'st share, Lucy shall the bowl prepare. From the brousing goat it flows, From each balmy shrub that grows; Hence the kidling's wanton fire, Hence the nerves that brace his sire. Vigorous, buxom, young and gay, Thou like them shalt love and play. What, tho' far from silver Thames, Stately piles, and courtly dames? Here we boast a purer flood, Joys that stream from sprightly blood; Here is simple beauty seen, Fair, and cloath'd like beauty's queen: Nature's hands the garbs compose, From the lilly and the rose. Or, if charm'd with richer dies, Fancy every robe supplies. Shou'd perchance some high-born fair, Absent, claim thy tender care; Here, enraptur'd shalt thou trace, S?'s shape, and R?'s face; While the waking dream shall pay, Many a wishing hopeless day. Domes with gold and toil unbought, Rise by magick pow'r of thought, Where by artist's hand undrawn, Slopes the vale, and spreads the lawn; As if sportive nature meant, Here to mock the works of Kent. Come, and with thee bring along Jocund tale and witty song, Sense to teach, and words to move, Arts that please, adorn, improve; And, to gild the glorious scene, Conscience spotless and serene. Poor with all a H?t's store, Lives the man who pines for more. Wretched he who doom'd to roam, Never can be blest at home; Nor retire within his mind, From th'ungrateful and unkind. Happy they whom crowds befriend, Curs'd who on the crowd depend; On the great one's peevish fit, On the coxcomb's spurious wit; Ever sentenc'd to bemoan Others failings in their own. If, like them, rejecting ease, Hills and health no longer please; Quick descend!—Thou may'st resort To the viceroy's splendid court. There, indignant, shalt thou see Cringing slaves, who might be free, Brib'd, with titles, hope, or gain, Tye their country's shameful chain; Or, inspir'd by heav'n's good cause, Waste the land with holy laws: While the gleanings of their power, Lawyers, lordlings, priests devour. Now, methinks, I hear thee say, “Drink alone thy mountain-whey! “Wherefore tempt the Irish shoals? “Sights like these are nearer Paul's. An ODE to William Pultney, Esq; By the Same. I Remote from liberty and truth, By fortune's crime, my early youth Drank error's poison'd springs. Taught by dark creeds and mystick law, Wrapt up in reverential awe, I bow'd to priests and kings. II Soon reason dawn'd, with troubled sight I caught the glimpse of painful light, Afflicted and afraid. Too weak it shone to mark my way, Enough to tempt my steps to stray Along the dubious shade. III Restless I roam'd, when from afar Lo Hooker shines! the friendly star Sends forth a steady ray. Thus cheer'd, and eager to pursue, I mount, till glorious to my view, Locke spreads the realms of day. IV Now warm'd with noble Sidney's page, I pant with all the patriot's rage; Now wrapt in Plato's dream, With More and Harrington around I tread fair Freedom's magick ground, And trace the flatt'ring scheme. V But soon the beauteous vision flies; And hideous spectres now arise, Corruption's direful train: The partial judge perverting laws, The priest forsaking virtue's cause, And senates slaves to gain. VI Vainly the pious artist's toil Would rear to heaven a mortal pile, On some immortal plan; Within a sure, tho' varying date, Confin'd alas! is every state Of empire and of man. VII What tho' the good, the brave, the wise, With adverse force undaunted rise, To break th'eternal doom! Tho' Cato liv'd, tho' Tully spoke, Tho' Brutus dealt the godlike stroke, Yet perish'd fated Rome. VIII To swell some future tyrant's pride, Good Fleury pours the golden tide On Gallia's smiling shores; Once more her fields shall thirst in vain For wholsome streams of honest gain, While rapine wastes her stores. IX Yet glorious is the great design, And such, O Pultney! such is thine, To prop a nation's frame. If crush'd beneath the sacred weight, The ruins of a falling state Shall tell the patriot's name. An Ode to the Right Honourable the Lord Lonsdale. By the Same. I Lonsdale! thou ever-honour'd name, For such is sacred virtue's claim, Say, why! my noble friend! While nature sheds her balmy powers O'er hill and dale, in leaves and flowers, Say, why my joys suspend! II Here spreads the lawn high-crown'd with wood, Here slopes the vale, there winds the flood In many a crystal maze; The fishes sport, in silver pride Slow moves the swan, on either side The herds promiscuous graze. III Or if the stiller shade you love, Here solemn nods th'imbow'ring grove O'er innocence and ease; Whether with deep reflection fraught, Or in the sprightly stream of thought, The lighter trifles please. IV Alluding to a certain scandalous libel.And should the shaft of treacherous spleen Glance venom'd through this peaceful scene, Unheeded may it fly. Provok'd, nor tempted to repay, Tho' truth severer prompt the lay, A mean prosaic lie. V Here with the pheasant and the hare, Unfearful of the human snare, Have statesmen pass'd a day. While far from yon forbidden gate, Pale care and lank remorse await Their slow-returning prey. VI O! blind to all the joys of life, Who seek them in the storm of strife, Destroying, or destroy'd. Less wretched they, and yet unbless'd, Who batten in lethargic rest, On blessings unenjoy'd. VII But come, my friend, the sun invites, For thee the town hath no delights, Distasted and aggriev'd; While fools believe, while villains cheat, Too honest to approve deceit, Too wise to be deceiv'd. VIII Or dost thou fear lest dire disease Again thy tortur'd frame may seize; And hast thou therefore stay'd? O! rather haste, where thou shalt find A ready hand, a gentle mind, To comfort and to aid. IX And while by sore afflictions try'd, You bear without the Stoic's pride, What Stoic never bore; O! may I learn like thee to bear, And what shall be my destin'd share, To suffer, not explore. An ODE. By the Same. [Gentle, idle, trifling boy] Gentle, idle, trifling boy, Sing of pleasures, sing of joy! Well you paint the crystal spring, Well the flow'ry meadow sing. But beware with bolder flight, Tempt not heaven's unequal height; But beware! with impious strain, Mock not freedom's hallow'd train! Sacred, here, O! ever be Heaven, and heaven-born liberty! Let the slaves of lawless sway, Let the stupid flock obey! Pent within a narrrow fold, Ty'd, and stript, and slain, and sold. Happier stars the brave befriend, Britons know a nobler end. Theirs it is to temper laws, Theirs to watch in freedom's cause, Theirs one common good to share, Theirs to feel one common care; In the glorious task combin'd, From the monarch to the hind. Yet O! cease not gentle boy! Sing of pleasures, sing of joy! Like thy brothers of the wing, Idly hop, and chirp, and sing. Heaven can nothing vain produce, Ev'ry creature has its use. Thine it is to sooth our toil, Thine to make e'en wisdom smile. Much they err who such despise, Trifles please the truly wise. An ODE. By the Same. [On Stow, the Muse's happy theme] I On Stow, the Muse's happy theme, Let fancy's eye enamour'd gaze; Where thro' one nobly simple scheme, Ten thousand varying beauties please. There patriot-virtue rears her shrine, Nor love! art thou depriv'd of thine. II Mark where from Pope's exhaustless vein, Pure flows the stream of copious thought, While nature pours the genial strain, With fairest springs of learning fraught; The treasures of each clime and age, Grace and enrich his sacred page. III So while thro' Britain's fields her Thames Prolifick rolls his silver tide; The tribute of a thousand streams Swells the majestick river's pride; And where his gen'rous current strays, The wealth of either world conveys. IV Far other, is that wretch's song, Whose scanty rill devoid of force, With idle tinklings creeps along, A narrow, crooked, dubious course; Or foul with congregated floods, Spreads a wide waste o'er plains, and woods. V In action thus the mind express'd High soars in Pope the true sublime; A Stow unfolds a Cobham's breast, A Bavius crawls in doggrel rhyme. Thro' all their various works we trace The greatly virtuous, and the base. An ODE. By the Same. [Too anxious for the publick weal] I Too anxious for the publick weal, Awhile suspend the toilsome strife! O think if Britain claim thy zeal, Thy friends and Britain claim thy life! II Thy gen'rous, free, and active soul, Inspir'd by glory's sacred flame, Springs ardent to the distant goal, And strains the weaker mortal frame. III Happy whom reason deigns to guide, Secure within the golden mean, Who shuns the Stoic's senseless pride, Nor wallows with the herd obscene. IV He nor with brow severely bent, Chides pleasure's smiling train away; Nor careless of life's great intent, With folly wastes each heedless day. V But from the mountain's lofty height, Now nature's mighty frame surveys; And now descending with delight, Along the humble valley strays. VI So have I seen thee gain applause, Tho' faction rag'd, from Britain's peers; Then glorious in thy country's cause, Go whisper love in Chloe's ears. An ODE to MANKIND. Address'd to the Prince. By the Same. INTRODUCTION to the PRINCE. Nor me the glories of thy birth engage, With royal names to swell my pompous page: Nor meaner views allure, in soothing lays To court thy favour with officious praise. Yet praise it is, thus to address thine ear In strains no slave dare sing, no tyrant hear; While warm for Britain's rights and nature's laws, I call forth Britain's Hope in freedom's cause: Assert an empire which to All belongs, And vindicate a world's long suffer'd wrongs. These saving truths import thee most to know, The links that tie the mighty to the low; What now, our fellow-subject, is your due, And, when our lord, shall be a debt on you. O! may'st thou to the throne such maxims bring! And feel the free-man while thou reign'st the king. Far hence the tribe, whose servile arts delude, And teach the great to spurn the multitude. Are those unworthy of the royal heir, Who claim the future monarch's duteous care? Still may thy thoughts the godlike task pursue, And to the many ne'er prefer the few! Still mayst thou fly thy fortune's specious friends, Who deal forth sov'reign grace to private ends; In narrow streams divert the copious tide, Exalt one sect, and damn the world beside; While with false lights directing partial rule, The lord of nations falls a party's tool. Such there have been—and such, in truth's despite, Disgrac'd the cause of liberty and right. But thou shalt rise superior to their arts, And fix thy empire in a people's hearts. Nor hence may faction boast her favour'd claim, Where selfish passions borow virtue's name: Free government alone preserves the free, And righteous rule is gen'ral liberty; Their guiding law is freedom's native voice, The publick good defin'd by publick choice; And justly should the bold offenders fall, Who dare invade the sov'reign rights of all; A king who proudly makes these claims his own, Or they whose rage should shake a lawful throne. From truths like these proceeds a right divine, And may the pow'r that rais'd, preserve thy scepter'd line. To MANKIND: An ODE. I Is there, or do the schoolmen dream? Is there on earth a pow'r supreme, The delegate of heav'n? To whom an uncontroul'd command, In ev'ry realm o'er sea and land, By special grace is giv'n? II Then say, what signs this god proclaim? Dwells he amidst the diamond's flame, A throne his hallow'd shrine? The borrow'd pomp, the arm'd array, Want, fear, and impotence betray: Strange proofs of pow'r divine! III If service due from human kind, To men in slothful ease reclin'd, Can form a sov'reign claim: Hail monarchs! ye, whom heav'n ordains, Our toils unshar'd, to share our gains, Ye ideots, blind and lame! IV Superior virtue, wisdom, might, Create and mark the ruler's right, So reason must conclude: Then thine it is, to whom belong The wise, the virtuous, and the strong, Thrice sacred multitude! V In thee, vast All! are these contain'd, For thee are those, thy parts ordain'd, So nature's systems roll: The scepter's thine, if such there be; If none there is, then thou art free, Great monarch! mighty whole! VI Let the proud tyrant rest his cause On faith, prescription, force, or laws, An host's or senate's voice! His voice affirms thy stronger due, Who for the many made the few, And gave the species choice. VII Unsanctify'd by thy command, Unown'd by thee, the scepter'd hand The trembling slave may bind. But loose from nature's moral ties, The oath by force impos'd belies The unassenting mind. VIII Thy will's thy rule, thy good its end; You punish only to defend What parent nature gave: And he who dare her gifts invade, By nature's oldest law is made Thy victim or thy slave. IX Thus reason founds the just decree On universal liberty, Not private rights resign'd: Through various nature's wide extent, No private beings e'er were meant To hurt the gen'ral kind. X Thee justice guides, thee right maintains, Th'oppressor's wrong, the pilf'rer's gains, Thy injur'd weal impair. Thy warmest passions soon subside, Nor partial envy, hate, nor pride, Thy temper'd counsels share. XI Each instance of thy vengeful rage, Collected from each clime and age, Tho' malice swell the sum, Would seem a spotless scanty scroll, Compar'd with Marius' bloody roll, Or Sylla's hippodrome. XII But thine has been imputed blame, Th'unworthy few assume thy name, The rabble weak and loud; Or those who on thy ruins feast, The lord, the lawyer, and the priest; A more ignoble crowd. XIII Avails it thee, if one devours, Or lesser spoilers share his pow'rs, While both thy claim oppose? Monsters who wore thy sully'd crown, Tyrants who pull'd those monsters down, Alike to thee were foes. XIV Far other shone fair Freedom's hand, Far other was th'immortal stand, When Hampden fought for thee: They snatch'd from rapine's gripe thy spoils, The fruits and prize of glorious toils, Of arts and industry. XV On thee yet foams the preacher's rage, On thee fierce frowns th'historian's page, A false apostate train: Tears stream adown the martyr's tomb; Unpity'd in their harder doom, Thy thousands strow the plain. XVI These had no charms to please the sense, No graceful port, no eloquence, To win the Muse's throng: Unknown, unsung, unmark'd they lie; But Cæsar's fate o'ercasts the sky, And Nature mourns his wrong. XVII Thy foes, a frontless band, invade; Thy friends afford a timid aid, And yield up half thy right. Ev'n Locke beams forth a mingled ray, Afraid to pour the flood of day On man's too feeble sight. XVIII Hence are the motly systems fram'd, Of right transfer'd, of power reclaim'd; Distinctions weak and vain. Wise Nature mocks the wrangling herd; For unreclaim'd, and untransfer'd, Her pow'rs and rights remain. XIX While law the royal agent moves, The instrument thy choice approves, We bow through him to you. But change, or cease th'inspiring choice, The sov'reign sinks a private voice, Alike in one, or few! XX Shall then the wretch, whose dastard heart Shrinks at a tyrant's nobler part, And only dares betray; With reptile wiles, alas! prevail, Where force, and rage, and priest-craft fail, To pilfer pow'r away? XXI O! shall the bought, and buying tribe, The slaves who take, and deal the bribe, A people's claims enjoy! So Indian murd'rers hope to gain The pow'rs and virtues of the slain, Of wretches they destroy. XXII “Avert it, heav'n! you love the brave, “You hate the treach'rous, willing slave, “The self-devoted head. “Nor shall an hireling's voice convey “That sacred prize to lawless sway, “For which a nation bled.” XXIII Vain pray'r, the coward's weak resource! Directing reason, active force, Propitious heaven bestows. But ne'er shall flame the thund'ring sky, To aid the trembling herd that fly Before the weaker foes. XXIV In names there dwell no magick charms, The British virtues, British arms Unloos'd our fathers' band: Say, Greece and Rome! if these shou'd fail, What names, what ancestors avail. To save a sinking land? XXV Far, far from us such ills shall be, Mankind shall boast one nation free, One monarch truly great: Whose title speaks a people's choice, Whose sovereign will a people's voice, Whose strength a prosp'rous state. VERSES to Camilla. By the Same. Weary'd with indolent repose, A life unmix'd with joys or woes; Where all the lazy moments crept, And ev'ry passion sluggish slept; I wish'd for love's inspiring pains, To rouze the loiterer in my veins. Th'officious power my call attends, He who uncall'd his succour lends; And with a smile of wanton spite, He gave Camilla to my sight. Her eyes their willing captive seize, Her look, her air, her manner please; New beauties please, unseen before, Or seen, in her they please me more; And soon, too soon, alas! I find The virtues of a nobler kind. Now cheerful springs the morning ray, Now cheerful sinks the closing day; For every morn with her I walk'd, And every eve with her I talk'd; With her I lik'd the vernal bloom, With her I lik'd the crowded room; From her at night I went with pain, And long'd for morn to meet again. How quick the smiling moments pass, Thro' varying fancy's mimick glass! While the gay seene is painted o'er, Where all was one wide blank before: And sweetly sooth'd th'inchanting dream, Till love inspir'd a bolder scheme. Camilla, stung with grief and shame, Now marks, and shuns the guilty flame; Fierce anger lighten'd in her face, Then cold reserve assum'd its place: And soon, the wretch's hardest fate, Contempt succeeds declining hate. No more my presence now she flies, She sees me with unheeding eyes; Sees me with various passion burn, Enrag'd depart, submiss return; Return with flattering hopes to find Soft pity move her gentle mind. But ah! her looks were still the same, Unmark'd I went, unmark'd I came; Unmark'd were all my hopes and fears, While Strephon whispers in her ears. O Jealousy! distracting guest! Fly to some happy lover's breast; Fitly with joy thou minglest care, But why inhabit with despair? To CLARISSA. By the Same. 'Twas when the friendly shade of night Suspends the busy cares of light, And on the various world bestows Or sprightly joy, or calm repose. With gen'rous wine the glass was crown'd, And mirth, and talk, and toasts went round. Clarissa came to bless the feast, Clarissa dearly welcome guest. Not such she look'd as when by day She blazes in the diamond's ray; And adding to each gem a grace, Give's India's wealth the second place. But soft reclin'd in careless ease, More pleasing, less intent to please. Loose flow'd her hair in wanton pride, Her robe unbound, her zone unty'd; Half bare to view her milk-white breast, A slender veil scarce shades the rest: Her eye with sparkling lustre glows, And wit in sweetest accent flows. Now sooth'd the angel's voice I hear, And drink in love at either ear; Now stung with wilder rapture gaze, While our eyes meet with blended rays; And kindling in th'infectious flame, I feel what words want pow'r to name. Awaking from the silent trance, Cautious I steal a broken glance; In clam'rous mirth each pang disguise, And laughter swell with bursting sighs; For Envy, pallid fiend, was there, And Jealousy with watchful care. Now ends the feast, each guest retires, And with them all my soul desires Clarissa goes.—Ah! cruel fate! She goes with her ill-sorted mate: Sullen and slow he moves along, And heavy hums a drowsy song. O! drowsy may the monster lye, And instant slumbers seal his eye! So shalt thou, best belov'd, escape The horrors of a legal rape. Or, shou'd the brutish instinct goad, And thou must bear th'unwelcome load; If struggle, pray'r, pretence be vain, To shun what tyrant-laws ordain; Ah sparing deal out scanty dues, And keep whate'er thou canst refuse! Ah! give no bounding pulse to beat, No cheek to glow with genial heat! No breast to heave in am'rous play, No limbs to twine, no hands to stray; But sluggish press the joyless bed, And lye in cold indiff'rence dead: Nor let the blasting spoiler sip The fragrance of thy balmy lip! To share with him the lover's part, Were rank adultery of the heart. But if, in chaster love's despite, Warm nature catch the known delight; While fierce desires tumultuous rise, And rapture melts thy closing eyes; Ah! be those joys for me design'd, And let me rush upon thy mind! To me the burning kiss impart, On me impress the humid dart, For me unlock the nectar'd store, Then sigh, and dream the transport o'er! Thus with her lov'd idea fraught, Delusive fancy charms my thought; And joining in the flatt'ring cheat, Willing I hug the dear deceit; From fiction real bliss receive, And all I fondly wish believe; Nor envy to a husband's arms, The dull fruition of her charms. But when, regardless of my truth, She smiles on some more favour'd youth; And while he whispers in her ears, With more than wonted pleasure hears; My jealous thought his voice supplies, And reads perdition in her eyes. Then torn with envy, love, and hate, I wish her with her wedded mate. An INSCRIPTION on the Tomb, Raised to the memory of the author's father, and of others his ancestors. By the Same. Unmark'd by trophies of the great and vain, Here sleeps in silent tombs a gentle train. No folly wasted their paternal store, No guilt, no sordid av'rice made it more; With honest fame, and sober plenty crown'd, They liv'd and spread their cheering influence round. May he whose hand this pious tribute pays, Receive a like return of filial praise! EPIGRAMS. By the Same. EPIGRAM I. [I lov'd thee beautiful and kind] I lov'd thee beautiful and kind, And plighted an eternal vow; So alter'd are thy face and mind, 'Twere perjury to love thee now. EPIGRAM II. [Since first you knew my am'rous smart] Since first you knew my am'rous smart, Each day augments your proud disdain; 'Twas then enough to break my heart, And now, thank heav'n! to break my chain. Cease, thou scorner, cease to shun me! Now let love and hatred cease! Half that rigour had undone me, All that rigour gives me peace. EPIGRAM III. [My heart still hovering round about you] My heart still hovering round about you, I thought I could not live without you; Now we have liv'd three months asunder, How I liv'd with you is the wonder. EPIGRAM IV. Upon the Bust of English worthies, at Stow. Among these chiefs of British race, Who live in breathing stone, Why has not Cobham's bust a place? The structure was his own. EPIGRAM V. [Tho' cheerful, discreet, and with freedom well bred] Tho' cheerful, discreet, and with freedom well bred, She never repented an idle word said: Securely she smiles on the forward and bold, They feel what they owe her, and feel it untold. EPIGRAM VI. [Lye on! while my revenge shall be] Lye on! while my revenge shall be, To speak the very truth of thee. EPIGRAM VII. [I swore I lov'd, and you believ'd] I swore I lov'd, and you believ'd, Yet, trust me, we were both deceiv'd; Tho' all I swore, was true. I lov'd one gen'rous, good, and kind, A form created in my mind; And thought that form was you. EPIGRAM VIII. On Mrs. Penelope. The gentle Pen with look demure, Awhile was thought a virgin pure: But Pen, as ancient poets say, Undid by night the work of day. EPIGRAM IX. On one who first abused, and then made love to a Lady. Foul ? with graceless verse, The noble ? dar'd asperse. But when he saw her well bespatter'd, Her reputation stain'd and tatter'd; He gaz'd and lov'd the hideous elf, She look'd so very like himself. True sung the bard well known to fame, Self-love and social are the same. EPIGRAM X. [While Lucy, chaste as mountain snows] While Lucy, chaste as mountain snows, Gives every idle fop a hearing; In Mary's breast a passion glows, Which stronger is from not appearing. Say, who has chose the better part! Mary to whom no joy is missing; Or she, who dupe to her own heart, Pays the full price of Mary's kissing. EPIGRAM XI. [She who in secret yields her heart] She who in secret yields her heart, Again may claim it from her lover; But she who plays the trifler's part, Can ne'er her squander'd fame recover. Then grant the boon for which I pray! 'Tis better lend than throw away. EPIGRAM XII. [We thought you without titles great] We thought you without titles great, And wealthy with a small estate; While by your humble self alone, You seem unrated and unknown. But now on fortune's swelling tide High-borne, in all the pomp of pride; Of grandeur vain and fond of pelf, 'Tis plain, my lord, you knew yourself. EPIGRAM XIII. [Lovely shines thy wedded fair] Lovely shines thy wedded fair, Gentle as the yielding air; Cheering as the solar beam, Soothing as the fountain-stream. Why then, jealous husband, rail? All may breathe the ambient gale, Bask in heaven's diffusive ray, Drink the streams that pass away. All may share unless'ning joy, Why then jealous, peevish boy? Water, air, and light confine, Ere thou think'st her only thine. EPIGRAM XIV. [Tom thought a wild profusion great] Tom thought a wild profusion great: And therefore spent his whole estate: Will thinks the wealthy are ador'd, And gleans what misers blush to hoard. Their passion, merit, fate the same, They thirst and starve alike for fame. EPIGRAM XV. To Clarissa. Why like a tyrant wilt thou reign, When thou may'st rule the willing mind? Can the poor pride of giving pain Repay the joys that wait the kind? I curse my fond enduring heart, Which scorn'd presumes not to be free, Condemn'd to feel a double smart, To hate myself, and burn for thee. EPIGRAM XVI. [Ever busy'd, ne'er employ'd] Ever busy'd, ne'er employ'd, Ever loving, ne'er enjoy'd, Ever doom'd to seek and miss, And pay unbless'd the price of bliss. EPIGRAM XVI. [Vainly hath heaven denounc'd the woman's woes] Vainly hath heaven denounc'd the woman's woes, Thou know'st no tender cares, no bitter woes, Unfelt your offspring comes, unfelt it goes. The Danger of Writing Verse. An EPISTLE. First printed in the Year 1741. By WILLIAM WHITEHEAD, Esq; Quæ poterant unquam satis expurgare cicutæ, Ni melius dormire putem, quam scribere versus? Hor. Ep. 2. Lib. 2. You ask me, sir, why thus by phantoms aw'd, No kind occasion tempts the Muse abroad? Why, when retirement sooths this idle art, To fame regardless sleeps the youthful heart? 'Twou'd wrong your judgment, shou'd I fairly say Distrust or weakness caus'd the cold delay: Hint the small diff'rence, till we touch the lyre, 'Twixt real genius and too strong desire; The human slips, or seeming slips pretend, That rouze the critick, but escape the friend; Nay which, tho' dreadful when the foe pursues, You pass, and smile, and still provoke the Muse. Yet, spite of all you think, or kindly feign, My hand will tremble while it grasps the pen. For not in this, like other arts, we try Our light excursions in a summer sky, No casual flights the dang'rous train admits, But wits once authors, are for ever wits. The fool in prose, like earth's unwieldy son, May oft rise vig'rous, tho' he's oft o'erthrown; One dangerous crisis marks our rise or fall, By all we're courted, or we're shunn'd by all. Will it avail, that unmatur'd by years, My easy numbers pleas'd your partial ears, If now condemn'd, my riper lays must bear The wise man's censure, and the vain man's sneer? Or, still more hard, ev'n where he's valu'd most, The man must suffer if the poet's lost; For wanting wit, be totally undone, And barr'd all arts for having fail'd in one. When fears like these his serious thoughts engage, No bugbear phantom curbs the poet's rage. 'Tis powerful reason holds the streighten'd rein, While flutt'ring fancy to the distant plain Sends a long look, and spreads her wings in vain. But grant for once, th'officious Muse has shed Her gentlest influence on his infant head, Let fears lie vanquish'd, and resounding Fame Give to the bellowing blast the poet's name. And see! distinguish'd from the crowd he moves, Each finger marks him, and each eye approves! Secure, as halcyons brooding o'er the deep, The waves roll gently, and the thunders sleep, Obsequious nature binds the tempest's wings, And pleas'd attention listens whilst he sings! O blissful state, O more than human joy! What shafts can reach him, or what cares annoy? What cares, my friend? why all that man can know, Oppress'd with real or with fancy'd woe. Rude to the world, like earth's first lord expell'd, To climes unknown, from Eden's safer field; No more eternal springs around him breathe, Black air scowls o'er him, deadly damps beneath; Now must he learn, misguided youth, to bear Each varying season of the poet's year: Flatt'ry's full beam, detraction's wintry store, The frowns of fortune, or the pride of pow'r. His acts, his words, his thoughts no more his own, Each folly blazon'd, and each frailty known. Is he reserv'd?—his sense is so refin'd It ne'er descends to trifle with mankind. Open and free?—they find the secret cause Is vanity; He courts the world's applause. Nay, tho' he speak not, something still is seen, Each change of face betrays a fault within. If grave, 'tis spleen; he smiles but to deride; And downright aukwardness in him is pride. Thus must he steer thro' fame's uncertain seas, Now sunk by censure, and now puff'd by praise; Contempt with envy strangely mix'd endure, Fear'd where caress'd, and jealous tho' secure. One fatal rock on which good authors split Is thinking all mankind must have their wit; And the grand business of the world stand still To listen to the dictates of their quill. Hurt if they fail, and yet how few succeed, What's born in leisure men of leisure read; And half of those have some peculiar whim Their test of sense, and read but to condemn. Besides, on parties now our fame depends, And frowns or smiles, as these are foes or friends. Wit, judgment, nature join; you strive in vain; 'Tis keen invective stamps the current strain. Fix'd to one side like Homer's gods, we fight, These always wrong, and those for ever right. And would you chuse to see your friend, resign'd Each conscious tie which guides the virtuous mind, Embroil'd in factions, hurl with dreadful skill The random vengeance of his desp'rate quill? 'Gainst pride in man with equal pride declaim, And hide ill-nature under virtue's name? Or deeply vers'd in flattery's wily ways, Flow in full reams of undistinguish'd praise? To vice's grave, or folly's bust bequeath The blushing trophy, and indignant wreath? Qui nescit qualia demens Ægyptus portenta colat? crocodilon adorat. Juv. Sat. 15.Like Ægypt's priests, did endless temples rise, And people with earth's pests th'offended skies? The Muse of old her native freedom knew, And wild in air the sportive wand'rer flew; On worth alone her bays eternal strow'd, And found the hero, ere she hymn'd the god. Nor less the chief his kind support return'd, No drooping Muse her slighted labours mourn'd; But stretch'd at ease she prun'd her growing wings, By sages honour'd and rever'd by kings. Ev'n knowing Greece confess'd her early claim, And warlike Latium caught the gen'rous flame. Not so our age regards the tuneful tongue, 'Tis senseless rapture all, and empty song: No Pollio sheds his genial influence round, No Varus listens whilst the groves resound. Ev'n those, the knowing and the virtuous few, Who noblest ends by noblest means pursue, Forget the poet's use; the powerful spell Of magic verse, which Sidney paints so well, Forget that Homer wak'd the Grecian flame, That Pindar rous'd inglorious Thebes to fame, That every age has great examples given Of virtue taught in verse, and verse inspir'd by heaven. But I forbear—these dreams no longer last, The times of fable and of flights are past. To glory now no laurel'd suppliants bend, No coins are struck, no sacred domes ascend. Yet ye, who still the Muse's charms admire, And best deserve the verse your deeds inspire, Ev'n in these gainful unambitious days, Feel for yourselves at least, ye fond of praise, And learn one lesson taught in mystic rhyme, “'Tis verse alone arrests the wings of Time.” Bacon de augmentis.Fast to the thread of life, annex'd by Fame, A sculptur'd medal bears each human name, O'er Lethe's streams the fatal threads depend, The glitt'ring medal trembles as they bend; Close but the shears, when chance or nature calls, The birds of rumour catch it as it falls; Awhile from bill to bill the trifle's tost, The waves receive it, and 'tis ever lost! But should the meanest swan that cuts the stream Consign'd to Phœbus, catch the favour'd name, Safe in her mouth she bears the sacred prize To where bright Fame's eternal altars rise. 'Tis there the Muse's friends true laurels wear, There Ptolemy Philadelphus. Ægypt's monarch reigns, and great Augustus there. Patrons of arts must live 'till arts decay, Sacred to verse in every poet's lay. Thus grateful France does Richlieu's worth proclaim, Thus grateful Britain doats on Somers' name. And, spite of party rage, and human flaws, And British liberty and British laws, Times yet to come shall sing of Anna's reign, And bards, who blame the measures, love the men. But why round patrons climb th'ambitious bays? Is interest then the sordid spur to praise? Persius.Shall the same cause, which prompts the chatt'ring jay To aim at words, inspire the poet's lay? And is there nothing in the boasted claim Of living labours and a deathless name? The pictur'd front, with sacred fillets bound? The sculptur'd bust with laurels wreath'd around? The annual roses scatter'd o'er his urn, And tears to flow from poets yet unborn? Illustrious all! but sure to merit these, Demands at least the poet's learned ease. Say, can the bard attempt what's truly great, Who pants in secret for his future fate? Him serious toils, and humbler arts engage, To make youth easy, and provide for age; While lost in silence hangs his useless lyre, And tho' from heav'n it came, fast dies the sacred fire. Or grant true genius with superior force Bursts ev'ry bond, resistless in its course, Yet lives the man, how wild soe'er his aim, Would madly barter fortune's smiles for fame! Or distant hopes of future ease forego, For all the wreaths that all the Nine bestow? Well pleas'd to shine, thro' each recording page, The hapless Dryden of a shameless age? Ill-fated bard! where-e'er thy name appears, The weeping verse a sad memento bears. Ah! what avail'd th'enormous blaze between Thy dawn of glory, and thy closing scene! When sinking nature asks our kind repairs, Unstrung the nerves, and silver'd o'er the hairs; When stay'd reflection comes uncall'd at last, And grey experience counts each folly past, Untun'd and harsh the sweetest strains appear, And loudest Pæans but fatigue the ear. 'Tis true the man of verse, tho' born to ills, Too oft deserves the very fate he feels. When, vainly frequent at the great man's board, He shares in ev'ry vice with ev'ry lord: Makes to their taste his sober sense submit, And 'gainst his reason madly arms his wit; Heav'n but in justice turns their serious heart To scorn the wretch, whose life belies his art. He, only he, should haunt the Muse's grove, Whom youth might rev'rence and grey hairs approve; Whose heav'n-taught numbers, now, in thunder roll'd, Might rouse the virtuous and appal the bold. Now, to truth's dictates lend the grace of ease, And teach instruction happier arts to please. For him would Plato change their gen'ral fate, And own one poet might improve his state. Curs'd be their verse, and blasted all their bays, Whose sensual lure th'unconscious ear betrays; Wounds the young breast, ere virtue spreads her shield, And takes, not wins, the scarce disputed field, Tho' specious rhetoric each loose thought refine, Tho' music charm in ev'ry labour'd line, The dang'rous verse, to full perfection grown, Bavius might blush, and Quarles disdain to own. Shou'd some Machaon, whose sagacious soul Trac'd blushing nature to her inmost goal, Skill'd in each drug the varying world provides, All earth embosoms, and all ocean hides, Nor cooling herb, nor healing balm supply, Ease the swoln breast, or close the languid eye; But, exquisitely ill, awake disease, And arm with poisons ev'ry baleful breeze: What racks, what tortures must his crimes demand, The more than Borgia of a bleeding land! And is less guilty he, whose shameless page Not to the present bounds its subtil rage, But spreads contagion wide, and stains a future age? Forgive me, Sir, that thus the moral strain, With indignation warm'd, rejects the rein; Nor think I rove regardless of my theme, 'Tis hence new dangers clog the paths to fame. Not to themselves alone such bards confine Fame's just reproach for virtue's injur'd shrine; Profan'd by them, the Muse's laurels fade, Her voice neglected, and her flame decay'd. And the son's son must feel the father's crime, A curse entail'd on all the race that rhyme. New cares appear, new terrors swell the train, And must we paint them ere we close the scene? Say, must the Muse th'unwilling task pursue, And to compleat her dangers mention you? Yes you, my friend, and those whose kind regard With partial fondness views this humble bard: Ev'n you he dreads.—Ah! kindly cease to raise Unwilling censure, by exacting praise. Just to itself the jealous world will claim A right to judge; or give, or cancel fame. And, if th'officious zeal unbounded flows, The friend too partial is the worst of foes. Platonis Apologia.Behold th'Athenian sage, whose piercing mind Had trac'd the wily lab'rinths of mankind, When now condemn'd, he leaves his infant care To all those evils man is born to bear. Not to his friends alone the charge he yields, But nobler hopes on juster motives builds; Bids e'en his foes their future steps attend, And dare to censure, if they dar'd offend. Wou'd thus the poet trust his offspring forth, Or bloom'd our Britain with Athenian worth: Wou'd the brave foe th'imperfect work engage With honest freedom, not with partial rage, What just productions might the world surprize! What other Popes, what other Maros rise! But since by foes, or friends alike deceiv'd, Too little those, and these too much believ'd; Since the same fate pursues by diff'rent ways, Undone by censure, or undone by praise; Since bards themselves submit to vice's rule, And party-feuds grow high, and patrons cool: Since, still unnam'd, unnumber'd ills behind Rise black in air, and only wait the wind: Let me, O let me, ere the tempest roar, Catch the first gale, and make the nearest shore; In sacred silence join th'inglorious train, Where humble peace, and sweet contentment reign; If not thy precepts, thy example own, And steal thro' life not useless, tho' unknown. To the Honourable ? By the Same. O Charles, in absence hear a friend complain, Who knows thou lov'st him whereso'er he goes, Yet feels uneasy starts of idle pain, And often would be told the thing he knows. Why then, thou loiterer, fleets the silent year, How dar'st thou give a friend unnecessary fear? We are not now beside that osier'd stream, Where erst we wander'd, thoughtless of the way: We do not now of distant ages dream, And cheat in converse half the ling'ring day; No fancied heroes rise at our command, And no Timoleon weeps, and bleeds no Theban band. Yet why complain? thou feel'st no want like these, From me, 'tis true, but me alone debar'd, Thou still in Granta's shades enjoy'st at ease The books we reverenc'd, and the friends we shar'd; Nor see'st without such aids the day decline, Nor think'st how much their loss has added weight to thine. Truth's genuine voice, the freely-opening mind, Are thine, are friendship's, and retirement's lot; To conversation is the world confin'd, Friends of an hour, who please and are forgot; And int'rest stains, and vanity controuls The pure unsullied thoughts, and sallies of our souls. O I remember, and with pride repeat The rapid progress which our friendship knew! Even at the first with willing minds we met, And ere the root was fix'd the branches grew, In vain had fortune plac'd her weak barrier, Clear was thy breast from pride, and mine from servile fear. I saw thee gen'rous, and with joy can say, My education rose above my birth, Thanks to those parent shades, on whose cold clay Fall fast my tears, and lightly lie the earth! To them I owe whate'er I dare pretend, Thou saw'st with partial eyes, and bade me call thee friend. Let others meanly heap the treasur'd store, And aukward fondness cares on cares employ To leave a race more exquisitely poor, Possess'd of riches which they ne'er enjoy: He's only kind who takes the noble way T'unbind the springs of thought and give them pow'r to play. His heirs shall bless him, and look down with scorn On vulgar pride from vaunted heroes sprung; Lords of themselves, thank heaven that they were born Above the sordid miser's glitt'ring dung, Above the servile grandeur of a throne, For they are Nature's heirs, and all her works their own. To Mr. GARRICK. By the Same. On old Parnassus, t'other day, The Muses met to sing and play; Apart from all the rest were seen The tragick and the comick queen, Engag'd, perhaps, in deep debate, On Rich's, or on Fleetwood's fate. When, on a sudden, news was brought That Garrick had the patent got, And both their ladyships again Might now return to Drury-lane. They bow'd, they simper'd, and agreed They wish'd the project might succeed, 'Twas very possible, the case Was likely too, and had a face— A face! Thalia titt'ring cry'd, And cou'd her joy no longer hide; Why, sister, all the world must see How much this makes for you and me: No longer now shall we expose Our unbought goods to empty rows, Or meanly be oblig'd to court From foreign aid a weak support; No more the poor polluted scene Shall teem with births of Harlequin; Or vindicated stage shall feel The insults of the dancer's heel. Such idle trash we'll kindly spare To operas now—they'll want them there; For Sadler's-Wells, they say, this year Has quite undone their engineer. Pugh, you're a wag, the buskin'd prude Reply'd, and smil'd; besides 'tis rude To laugh at foreigners, you know, And triumph o'er a vanquish'd foe: For my part, I shall be content If things succeed as they are meant; And should not be displeas'd to find Some changes of the tragick kind. And say, Thalia, mayn't we hope The stage will take a larger scope? Shall he whose all-expressive powers Can reach the heights that Shakespear soars, Descend to touch an humbler key, And tickle ears with poetry; Where every tear is taught to flow Thro' many a line's melodious woe, And heart-felt pangs of deep distress Are fritter'd into similes? —O thou, whom nature taught the art To pierce, to cleave, to tear the heart, Whatever name delight thine ear, Othello, Richard, Hamlet, Lear, O undertake my just defence, And banish all but nature hence! See, to thy aid with streaming eyes The fair afflicted Mrs. Cibber. Constance flies; Now wild as winds in madness tears Her heaving breasts and scatter'd hairs; Or low on earth disdains relief With all the conscious pride of grief. My Pritchard too in Hamlet's queen— The goddess of the sportive vein Here stop'd her short, and with a sneer, My Pritchard, if you please, my dear! Her tragick merit I confess, But surely mine's her proper dress; Behold her there with native ease, And native spirit, born to please; With all Maria's charms engage, Or Milwood's arts, or Touchwood's rage, Thro' every foible trace the fair, Or leave the town, and toilet's care To chaunt in forests unconfin'd The wilder notes of Rosalind. O thou, where-e'er thou fix thy praise, Brute, Drugger, Fribble, Ranger, Bays! O join with her in my behalf, And teach an audience when to laugh. So shall buffoons with shame repair To draw in fools at Smithfield fair, And real humour charm the age, Tho' Mr. Quin, inimitable in that character, who was then leaving the stage. Falstaff should forsake the stage. She spoke. Melpomene reply'd, And much was said on either side; And many a chief, and many a fair, Were mention'd to their credit there. But I'll not venture to display What goddesses think fit to say. However, Garrick, this at least Appears, by both a truth confess'd, That their whole fate for many a year But hangs on your paternal care. A nation's taste depends on you —Perhaps a nation's virtue too. O think how glorious 'twere to raise A theatre to virtue's praise. Where no indignant blush might rise, Nor wit be taught to plead for vice: But every young attentive ear Imbibe the precepts, living there. And every unexperienc'd breast There feel its own rude hints express'd, And, waken'd by the glowing scene, Unfold the worth that lurks within. If possible, be perfect quite; A few short rules will guide you right. Consult your own good sense in all, Be deaf to fashion's fickle call, Nor e'er descend from reason's laws To court what you command, applause. NATURE to Dr. HOADLY. On his Comedy of the Suspicious Husband. By the Same. Sly hypocrite! was this your aim? To borrow Pæon's sacred name, And lurk beneath his graver mien, To trace the secrets of my reign? Did I for this applaud your zeal, And point out each minuter wheel, Which finely taught the next to roll, And made my works one perfect whole? For who, but I, till you appear'd To model the dramatic herd, E'er bade to wond'ring ears and eyes, Such pleasing intricacies rise? Where every part is nicely true, Yet touches still some master clue; Each riddle opening by degrees, 'Till all unravels with such ease, That only those who will be blind Can feel one doubt perplex their mind. Nor was't enough, you thought, to write, But you must impiously unite With Garrick too, who long before Had stole my whole expressive pow'r. That changeful Proteus of the stage Usurps my mirth, my grief, my rage; And as his diff'rent parts incline, Gives joys or pains, sincere as mine. Yet you shall find (howe'er elate You triumph in your former cheat) 'Tis not so easy to escape In Nature's as in Pæon's shape. For every critick, great or small, Hates every thing that's natural. The beaus, and ladies too, can say, What does he mean? is this a play? We see such people every day. Nay more, to chafe, and teize your spleen, And teach you how to steal again, My very fools shall prove you're bit, And damn you for your want of wit. The Youth and the Philosopher. A FABLE. By the Same. A Grecian Youth, of talents rare, Whom Plato's philosophick care Had form'd for virtue's nobler view, By precept and example too, Wou'd often boast his matchless skill, To curb the steed and guide the wheel. And as he pass'd the gazing throng, With graceful ease, and smack'd the thong, The ideot wonder they express'd Was praise and transport to his breast. At length quite vain, he needs would shew His master what his art could do; And bade his slaves the chariot lead To Academus' sacred shade. The trembling grove confess'd its fright, The wood-nymphs startled at the sight, The Muses drop the learned lyre, And to their inmost shades retire! Howe'er, the youth with forward air, Bows to the sage, and mounts the car, The lash resounds, the coursers spring, The chariot marks the rolling ring, And gath'ring crowds with eager eyes, And shouts, pursue him as he flies. Triumphant to the goal return'd, With nobler thirst his bosom burn'd; And now along th'indented plain, The self-same track he marks again, Pursues with care the nice design, Nor ever deviates from the line. Amazement seiz'd the circling crowd; The youths with emulation glow'd; Ev'n bearded sages hail'd the boy, And all, but Plato, gaz'd with joy. For he, deep-judging sage, beheld With pain the triumphs of the field: And when the charioteer drew nigh, And, flush'd with hope, had caught his eye, Alas! unhappy youth, he cry'd, Expect no praise from me, (and sigh'd) With indignation I survey Such skill and judgment thrown away. The time profusely squander'd there, On vulgar arts beneath thy care, If well employ'd, at less expence, Had taught thee honour, virtue, sense, And rais'd thee from a coachman's fate To govern men, and guide the state. An ODE to a Gentleman, On his pitching a Tent in his Garden. By the Same. Ah! friend, forbear, nor fright the fields With hostile scenes of imag'd war; Content still roves the blooming wilds, And sheds her mildest influence there: Ah! drive not the sweet wand'rer from her seat, Nor with rude arts profane her latest best retreat. Are there not bowers, and sylvan scenes, By nature's kind luxuriance wove? Has Romely lost the living greens Which erst adorn'd her artless grove? Where thro' each hallow'd haunt the poet stray'd, And met the willing Muse, and peopled every shade. But now no bards thy woods among, Shall wait th'inspiring Muse's call; For tho' to mirth and festal song Thy choice devotes the woven wall, Yet what avails that all be peace within, If horrors guard the gate, and scare us from the scene? 'Tis true of old the patriarch spread His happier tents which knew not war, And chang'd at will the trampled mead For fresher greens and purer air; But long has man forgot such simple ways, Truth unsuspecting harm!—the dream of ancient days. Ev'n he, cut off from human kind, (Thy neighb'ring wretch) the child of Care, Who to his native mines confin'd, Nor sees the sun, nor breathes the air, But 'midst the damps and darkness of earth's womb Drags out laborious life, and scarcely dreads the tomb; Ev'n he, should some indulgent chance Transport him to thy sylvan reign, Would eye the floating veil askance, And hide him in his caves again, While dire presage in every breeze that blows Hears shrieks and clashing arms, and all Germania's woes. And doubt not thy polluted taste A sudden vengeance shall pursue; Each fairy form we whilom trac'd Along the morn or evening dew, Nymph, Satyr, Faun, shall vindicate their grove, Robb'd of its genuine charms, and hospitable Jove. I see, all-arm'd with dews unblest, Keen frosts, and noisome vapours drear, Already, from the bleak north-east, The Genius of the wood appear! —Far other office once his prime delight, To nurse thy saplings tall, and heal the harms of night, With ringlets quaint to curl thy shade, To bid the insect tribes retire, To guard thy walks and not invade— O wherefore then provoke his ire? Alas! with prayers, with tears his rage repel, While yet the red'ning shoots with embryo-blossoms swell. Too late thou'lt weep, when blights deform The fairest produce of the year; Too late thou'lt weep, when every storm Shall loudly thunder in thy ear, “Thus, thus the green-hair'd deities maintain “Their own eternal rights, and Nature's injur'd reign.” On a Message-Card in Verse. Sent by a LADY. By the Same. Hermes, the gamester of the sky, To share for once mankind's delights, Slip'd down to earth, exceeding sly, And bade his coachman drive to White's. In form a beau; so light he trips, You'd swear his wings were at his heels; From glass to glass alert he skips, And bows and prattles while he deals. In short, so well his part he play'd, The waiters took him for a peer; And ev'n some great ones whisp'ring said He was no vulgar foreigner. Whate'er he was, he swept the board, Won every bett, and every game; Stript even the Rooks, who stampt and roar'd, And wonder'd how the devil it came! He wonder'd too, and thought it hard; But found at last this great command Was owing to one fav'rite card, Which still brought luck into his hand. The four of spades; whene'er he saw Its sable spots, he laugh'd at rules, Took odds beyond the gaming law, And Hoyle and Philidor were fools. But now, for now 'twas time to go, What gratitude shall he express? And what peculiar boon bestow Upon the cause of his success? Suppose, for something must be done, On Juno's self he cou'd prevail To pick the pips out, one by one, And stick them in her peacock's tail. Shou'd Pallas have it, was a doubt, To twift her silk, or range her pins; Or should the Muses cut it out, For bridges to their violins. To Venus should the prize be giv'n, Superior beauty's just reward, And 'gainst the next great rout in heaven Be sent her for a message card. Or hold—by Jove, a lucky hit! Your goddesses are arrant farces; Go, carry it to Mrs. ? And bid her fill it full of verses. The Je ne scai Quoi. A SONG. By the Same. I Yes, I'm in love, I feel it now, And Cælia has undone me; And yet I'll swear I can't tell how The pleasing plague stole on me. II 'Tis not her face which love creates, For there no graces revel; 'Tis not her shape, for there the fates Have rather been uncivil. III 'Tis not her air, for sure in that There's nothing more than common; And all her sense is only chat, Like any other woman. IV Her voice, her touch might give th'alarm— 'Twas both perhaps, or neither; In short, 'twas that provoking charm Of Cælia altogether. An ODE On a distant Prospect of ETON COLLEGE. By Mr. Gray. Ye distant spires, ye antique towers, That crown the wat'ry glade, Where grateful science still adores Her Henry's holy shade; And ye that from the stately brow Of Windsor's heights th'expanse below Of grove, of lawn, of mead survey, Whose turf, whose shade, whose flowers among Wanders the hoary Thames along His silver-winding way. Ah happy hills, ah pleasing shade, Ah fields belov'd in vain, Where once my careless childhood stray'd, A stranger yet to pain! I feel the gales, that from ye blow, A momentary bliss bestow, As waving fresh their gladsome wing, My weary soul they seem to sooth, And, redolent of joy and youth, To breathe a second spring. Say, father Thames, for thou hast seen Full many a sprightly race Disporting on thy margent green, The paths of pleasure trace, Who foremost now delight to cleave With pliant arms thy glassy wave? The captive linnet which enthrall? What idle progeny succeed To chase the rolling circle's speed, Or urge the flying ball? While some on earnest business bent Their murm'ring labours ply, 'Gainst graver hours, that bring constraint To sweeten liberty: Some bold adventurers disdain The limits of their little reign, And unknown regions dare descry: Still as they run, they look behind, They hear a voice in every wind, And snatch a fearful joy. Gay hope is theirs by fancy fed, Less pleasing when possess'd; The tear forgot as soon as shed, The sun-shine of the breast. Theirs buxom health of rosy hue, Wild wit, invention ever-new, And lively chear of vigour born; The thoughtless day, the easy night, The spirits pure, the slumbers light, That fly th'approach of morn. Alas, regardless of their doom, The little victims play! No sense have they of ills to come, No care beyond to-day: Yet see how all around 'em wait The ministers of human fate, And black misfortune's baleful train! Ah, shew them where in ambush stand, To seize their prey the murth'rous band, Ah, shew them they are men! These shall the fury passions tear, The vultures of the mind, Disdainful anger, pallid fear, And shame that sculks behind; Or pineing love shall waste their youth, Or jealousy with rank'ling tooth, That inly gnaws the secret heart, And envy wan, and faded care, Grim-visag'd comfortless despair, And sorrow's piercing dart. Ambition this shall tempt to rise, Then whirl the wretch from high, To bitter scorn a sacrifice, And grinning infamy; The stings of falsehood those shall try, And hard unkindness' alter'd eye, That mocks the tear it forc'd to flow; And keen remorse with blood defil'd, And moody madness laughing wild Amidst severest woe. Lo, in the vale of years beneath, A griesly troop are seen, The painful family of death, More hideous than their queen: This racks the joints, this fires the veins, That every lab'ring sinew strains, Those in the deeper vitals rage: Lo, poverty, to fill the band, That numbs the soul with icy hand, And slow-consuming age. To each his suff'rings: all are men, Condemn'd alike to groan, The tender for another's pain; Th'unfeeling for his own. Yet ah! why should they know their fate! Since sorrow never comes too late, And happiness too swiftly flies. Thought would destroy their paradise. No more, where ignorance is bliss, 'Tis folly to be wise. ODE. By the Same. [Lo! where the rosy-bosom'd hours] I Lo! where the rosy-bosom'd hours, Fair Venus' train appear, Disclose the long-expecting flowers, And wake the purple year! The Attick warbler pours her throat Responsive to the cuckow's note, The untaught harmony of spring: While whisp'ring pleasure as they fly, Cool Zephyrs thro' the clear blue sky Their gather'd fragrance fling. II Where-e'er the oak's thick branches stretch A broader browner shade; Where-e'er the rude and moss-green beech O'er-canopies the glade; Beside some water's rushy brink With me the Muse shall sit and think (At ease reclin'd in rustick state) How vain the ardour of the crowd, How low, how indigent the proud, How little are the great! III Still is the toiling hand of care: The panting herds repose: Yet hark, how through the peopled air The busy murmur glows! The insect youth are on the wing, Eager to taste the honied spring, And float amid the liquid noon: Some lightly o'er the current skim, Some shew their gayly-gilded trim Quick-glancing to the sun. IV To Contemplation's sober eye Such is the race of man: And they that creep, and they that fly, Shall end where they began. Alike the busy and the gay But flutter thro' life's little day, In fortune's varying colours dress'd: Brush'd by the hand of rough mischance, Or chill'd by age, their airy dance They leave, in dust to rest. V Methinks I hear in accents low The sportive kind reply: Poor moralist! and what art thou? A solitary fly! Thy joys no glittering female meets, No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets, No painted plumage to display: On hasty wings thy youth is flown; Thy sun is set, thy spring is gone— We frolick, while 'tis May. ODE on the Death of a Favourite Cat, Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes. By the Same. I 'Twas on a lofty vase's side, Where China's gayest art had dy'd The azure flowers, that blow; Demurest of the Tabby kind, The pensive Selima reclin'd, Gaz'd on the lake below. II Her conscious tail her joy declar'd; The fair round face, the snowy beard, The velvet of her paws, The coat that with the tortoise vies, Her ears of jet, and emerald eyes, She saw; and purr'd applause. III Still had she gaz'd: but 'midst the tide Two beauteous forms were seen to glide, The Genii of the stream; Their scaly armour's Tyrian hue Thro' richest purple to the view Betray'd a golden gleam. IV The hapless nymph with wonder saw: A whisker first and then a claw With many an ardent wish, She stretch'd in vain to reach the prize. What female heart can gold despise? What cat's averse to fish? V Presumptuous maid! with looks intent Again she stretch'd, again she bent, Nor knew the gulph between; (Malignant Fate sat by and smil'd) The slipp'ry verge her feet beguil'd, She tumbled headlong in. VI Eight times emerging from the flood She mew'd to ev'ry wat'ry god, Some speedy aid to send. No Dolphin came, no Nereid stirr'd: Nor cruel Tom, nor Susan heard. A fav'rite had no friend! [VII] From hence, ye beauties undeceiv'd, Know, one false step is ne'er retriev'd, And be with caution bold. Not all that tempts your wand'ring eyes And heedless hearts, is lawful prize; Nor all, that glisters, gold. A MONODY On the Death of Queen CAROLINE. By Richard West, Esq; Son to the Chancellor of Ireland, and Grandson to Bishop Burnet. I. Sing we no more of Hymeneal lays, Nor strew the land with myrtles and with bays: The voice of joy is fled the British shore, For Caroline's no more: And now our sorrows ask a sadder string; Come, plaintive goddess of the Cyrrhan spring, Pour thy deep note, and shed thy tuneful tear, And, while we lose the memory of pain In thy oblivious strain, —Ah! drop thy cypress on yon mournful bier! Begin: nor more delay The sacred meed of gratitude to pay: Begin: whate'er immortal song can do, To the dear name of Caroline is due: Who loves the Muse, deserves the Muse's love: Then raise thy numbers high, Sound out her glory to the throne of Jove, Spread the glad voice thro' all the ambient sky, From the dull marble vindicate her praise, And waft it down to lighten future days. II. Ye bards to come, the song of truth attend: This, this is she, the Muse's judge and friend! The royal female! whose benignant hand Throughout fair Albion's land Dealt every useful, every decent part, Each Memphian science, and each Attick art: Within the Muse's bower She oft was wont to lose the vacant hour, Or underneath the sapient grot reclin'd, Her soul to contemplation she resign'd, And for awhile laid down The painful, envied burthen of a crown: Mean time thy rural ditty was not mute, Sweet bard of Merlin's cave! Tho' rude, thy ditty was of her, who gave Thy voice to sing, and tun'd thy oaten flute In strains unwonted to the ear of swain: As when the lark, ambitious of the skies, Quits the low harvest of the golden plain, Taught by the sun's inspiring warmth to rise, Sublime in air he spreads his dappled wings, Mounts the blue æther, and in mounting sings. III. But whither wanders the licentious song? Such joyous notes to happier days belong! Ah me! our happier days are now no more:— Return, sad Muse: see pale Britannia weep, See all the sisters of the subject deep Their sovereign's loss deplore! See fond Ierne gives her sorrows vent, And as she tunes her brazen lyre to woe, Indulge her grief to flow!— See even the northern Orcades lament! Nor ends the wailing here: Where-e'er beneath our flag wild Ocean roars, From farthest Orient to Hesperia's shores, From torrid Affrick to the world's cold end, The British woes extend: And every colony has dropt a tear. IV. O honour'd flood! with reeds Pierian crown'd, Isis! whose argent waters glide along Fair Bellosite's Lycæan shades renown'd, Now aid my feeble song; And call thy chosen sons, and bid them bring Their lays of Dorick air, With lenient sounds to steal awhile from care Th'inconsolable King: O! sooth his anguish, and compose his pains With artful unimaginable strains, According sweetly to the golden lyre, Such as might half inspire The iron breast of Hades to resign Our lost, lov'd Caroline. V. These are thy glorious deeds, almighty Death! These are thy triumphs o'er the sons of men, That now receive the miserable breath, Which the next moment they resign again! Ah me! what boots us all our boasted power, Our golden treasure, and our purpled state? They cannot ward th'inevitable hour, Nor stay the fearful violence of Fate: —Virtue herself shall sail: Else now, if virtue ever could prevail, Death had not dar'd to violate the throne, Nor had Britannia heard her sovereign groan. —Ye nymphs! recall the song: For heaven-born virtue does to heaven belong, And scorns the meanest of her sons should die, But opens him a passage to the sky; Her rod ay-pointing to th'eternal goal, From the brute earth she frees the ardent soul; Swift from the vulgar herd aloft she springs, Spurns the moist clay, and soars on azure wings. VI. Then hence with sorrows vain: Ye Theban Muses! elevate the strain: Search o'er the records of immortal fame, And high refulgent on the female line, Imblaze in starry characters the name Of British Caroline: While sacred story rings with Sheba's praise, While Berenice's virtues still inspire The Cyrenean lyre, And Gloriana blooms in Spenser's lays; Thy name, great Queen, shall glow in every page, Shall dwell in every clime, and live in every age. When George shall go, where William went before, And all the present world shall be no more; When the fond factions of unjust mankind, The mean, the mad, the envious, and the blind, Shall turn to worms and dust; Then Time, impartial judge, that states the price Of each man's virtue, and of each man's vice, From thy bright fame shall clear the cank'ring rust; And O! the Muses ever shall be just. VII. But lo! what sudden radiance gilds the skies? 'Tis Gratitude descending from above, Known by the sweetness of her dove-like eyes, Daughter of truth and universal love! To Henry's sacred dome she wafts along, And on thy tomb she pours Celestial sweets and aramanthine flowers: The old, the young, the rich, the wretched crowd Numerous around her, and with accents loud Raise the mix'd voice, and pour the grateful song: “Hail Queen adorn'd by nature and by art! “Thine was each virtue of the head and heart; “Thy people blest thee, and thy children lov'd, “And thy King honour'd, and thy God approv'd,” VIII. But here my labours cease: 'Tis time the foaming courser to release. And thou, O royal shade, Forgive the Muse that these vain honours paid; A Muse as yet unheeded and unknown; That dares to sacrifice to truth alone, Not prone to blame, not hasty to commend. No foe unjust, no mercenary friend, No sensual bosom, no ungenerous mind, And tho' not virtuous, virtuously inclin'd. A PIPE of TOBACCO: In Imitation of Six Several Authors. IMITATION I. A New-Year's ODE. Recitativo. Old battle-array, big with horror is fled, And olive-rob'd peace again lifts up her head, Sing, ye Muses, Tobacco, the blessing of peace; Was ever a nation so blessed as this? AIR. When summer suns grow red with heat, Tobacco tempers Phœbus' ire, When wintry storms around us beat, Tobacco cheers with gentle fire. Yellow autumn, youthful spring, In thy praises jointly sing. Recitativo. Like Neptune, Cæsar guards Virginian fleets, Fraught with Tobacco's balmy sweets; Old Ocean trembles at Britannia's pow'r, And Boreas is afraid to roar. AIR. Happy mortal! he who knows Pleasure which a Pipe bestows; Curling eddies climb the room, Wafting round a mild perfume. Recitativo. Let foreign climes the vine and orange boast, While wastes of war deform the teeming coast; Britannia, distant from each hostile sound, Enjoys a Pipe, with ease and freedom crown'd; E'en restless faction finds itself most free, Or if a slave, a slave to liberty. AIR. Smiling years that gayly run Round the zodiack with the sun, Tell, if ever you have seen Realms so quiet and serene. British sons no longer now Hurl the bar, or twang the bow, Nor of crimson combat think, But securely smoke and drink. CHORUS. Smiling years, that gayly run Round the zodiack with the sun, Tell, if ever you have seen Realms so quiet and serene. IMITATION II. Little tube of mighty pow'r, Charmer of an idle hour, Object of my warm desire, Lip of wax, and eye of fire: And thy snowy taper waist, With my finger gently brac'd; And thy pretty swelling crest, With my little stopper prest, And the sweetest bliss of blisses, Breathing from thy balmy kisses. Happy thrice, and thrice agen, Happiest he of happy men; Who when agen the night returns, When agen the taper burns; When agen the cricket's gay, (Little cricket, full of play) Can afford his tube to feed With the fragment Indian weed: Pleasure for a nose divine, Incense of the god of wine. Happy thrice, and thrice agen, Happiest he, of happy men. IMITATION III. O thou, matur'd by glad Hesperian suns, Tobacco, fountain pure of limpid truth, That looks the very soul; whence pouring thought Swarms all the mind; absorpt is yellow care, And at each puff imagination burns: Flash on thy bard, and with exalting fires Touch the mysterious lip that chaunts thy praise, In strains to mortal sons of earth unknown. Behold an engine, wrought from tawny mines Of ductile clay, with plastick virtue form'd, And glaz'd magnifick o'er, I grasp, I fill. From Pætotheke with pungent pow'rs perfum'd Itself one tortoise, all, where shines imbib'd Each parent ray; then rudely ram'd illume, With the red touch of zeal-enkindling sheet, Mark'd with Gibsonian lore; forth issue clouds, Thought-thrilling, thirst-inciting clouds around, And many-mining fires: I all the while, Lolling at ease, inhale the breezy balm. But chief, when Bacchus wont with thee to join, In genial strife and orthodoxal ale, Stream life and joy into the Muse's bowl. Oh be thou still my great inspirer, thou My Muse; oh fan me with thy zephyrs boon, While I, in clouded tabernacle shrin'd, Burst forth all oracle and mystick song. IMITATION IV. Criticks avaunt; Tobacco is my theme; Tremble like hornets at the blasting steam. And you, court-insects, flutter not too near Its light, nor buzz within the scorching sphere. Pollio, with flame like thine, my verse inspire, So shall the Muse from smoke elicit fire. Coxcombs prefer the tickling sting of snuff; Yet all their claim to wisdom is—a puff: Lord Foplin smokes not—for his teeth afraid: Sir Tawdry smokes not—for he wears brocade. Ladies, when pipes are brought, affect to swoon; They love no smoke, except the smoke of town; But courtiers hate the puffing tribe,—no matter, Strange if they love the breath that cannot flatter! Its foes but shew their ignorance; can he Who scorns the leaf of knowledge, love the tree? The tainted templar (more prodigious yet) Rails at Tobacco, tho' it makes him—spit. Critonia vows it has an odious stink; She will not smoke (ye gods!)—but she will drink: And chaste Prudelia (blame her if you can) Says, pipes are us'd by that vile creature Man: Yet crowds remain, who still its worth proclaim, While some for pleasure smoke, and some for fame: Fame, of our actions universal spring, For which we drink, eat, sleep, smoke—ev'ry thing. IMITATION V. Blest leaf! whose aromatick gales dispense To templars modesty, to parsons sense: So raptur'd priests, at fam'd Dodona's shrine Drank inspiration from the steam divine. Poison that cures, a vapour that affords Content, more solid than the smile of lords: Rest to the weary, to the hungry food, The last kind refuge of the Wise and Good. Inspir'd by thee, dull cits adjust the scale Of Europe's peace, when other statesmen fail. By thee protected, and thy sister, beer, Poets rejoice, nor think the bailiff near. Nor less the critick owns thy genial aid, While supperless he plies the piddling trade. What tho' to love and soft delights a foe, By ladies hated, hated by the beau, Yet social freedom, long to courts unknown, Fair health, fair truth, and virtue are thy own. Come to thy poet, come with healing wings, And let me taste thee unexcis'd by kings. IMITATION VI. Boy! bring an ounce of Freeman's best, And bid the vicar be my guest: Let all be plac'd in manner due, A pot wherein to spit or spue, And London Journal, or Free-Briton, Of use to light a pipe, or This village, unmolested yet By troopers shall be my retreat: Who cannot flatter, bribe, betray; Who cannot write or vote for ?. Far from the vermin of the town, Here let me rather live, my own, Doze o'er a pipe, whose vapour bland In sweet oblivion lulls the land; Of all which at Vienna passes, As ignorant ? Brass is: And scorning rascals to caress, Extol the days of good Queen Bess, When first Tobacco blest our isle, Then think of other Queens—and smile. Come jovial pipe, and bring along Midnight revelry and song; The merry catch, the madrigal, That echoes sweet in City Hall; The parson's pun, the smutty tale Of country justice o'er his ale. I ask not what the French are doing, Or Spain to compass Britain's ruin: Britons, if undone, can go, Where Tobacco loves to grow. ODE to the Hon. C. Y. By the Same. Charles, son of Yorke, who on the mercy-seat Of justice states the bounds of right and wrong; Not like the vulgar law-bewilder'd throng, Who in the maze of error, hope to meet Truth, or hope rather to delude with lies And airy phantoms, under truth's disguise. Some wrapt in precedents, or points decreed, Or lop or stretch the laws to forms precise: Some, who the pedantry of rules despise, Plain sense adopt, from legal fetters freed; Sense without science, fleeting, unconfin'd, Is empty guess, and shifts with ev'ry wind. But he, thy sire, with more discerning toil, Rang'd the wide field, sagacious to explore Where lay dispers'd or hid the precious ore; Then form'd into a whole the gather'd spoil, Law, reason, equity, which now unite, Reflecting each on each a friendly light. Blest in a guide, a pattern so compleat, Tread, as thou do'st his footsteps; for not rude Thy genius, not uncultur'd, unsubdu'd. Yet there are intervals and seasons meet, To smooth the brow of thought; nor thou disdain Fit hour of vacance with the Muse's train. Let meaner spirits, cast in common mould, Who feed on husks of learned lore, refuse To hear the lessons of the warbling Muse; Nor know that bards, the law-givers of old, By soothing song to moral truth beguil'd Man, till then fierce, a lawless race, and wild. What means the lyre, by which the fabled sage Drew beasts to listen, and made rocks advance Around him as he play'd, in mystick dance? What, but the Muse? who soften'd human rage. Parent of concord, she prepar'd the plan Of social life, and man attun'd to man. She taught the sphere to move in fair array, Each in their orbits heark'ning to her strain; Else would they wander o'er th'etherial plain Licentious, but that she directs their way: She aw'd to temper, by her magick spell, The warring elements, and powers of hell. They err, who think the Muses not ally'd To Themis; both are of celestial birth: Both give peace, order, harmony to earth; Both by one heav'nly fountain are supply'd; And men and angels hymn, in general quire, What law ordains, and what the Nine inspire. From CÆLIA to CLOE. By the Same. I rural life enjoy, the town's your taste, In this we differ, twins in all the rest. Yet when the dog-star brings diseases on, And each fond mother trembles for her son; Now when the Mall's forlorn, the beaux and belles All for retirement crowd to Tunbridge-Wells; Say, will not Cloe for awhile withdraw From dear Vaux-hall and charming Ranelagh? Sure at this homely hutt one may contrive Awhile not only to exist, but live; For not dull landscapes here my thoughts engross, Woods, lawns, and rills, and grottoes green with moss. No, the same appetite that courts infuse, Haunts in retreat, and to the shade pursues. Here all my care are to receive and pay Visits, my studies a romance or play. And then to pass the live-long Sunday off, Walks or a ride, nay church serves well enough. At church, one has a chance to see cockades, Lur'd thither in pursuit of country-maids: Or tall Hibernian smit with fond desire To wed the only daughter of a squire. Cards have their turn, to kill a tedious hour, If baulk'd of whist, piquette is in my pow'r; For oft the captain, fresh from town, bestows A friendly week upon his friend my spouse. Then gaily glide the days on downy feet, For sure the captain has prodigious wit; O I could hear his sweet discourse for ever, Of all that's done, and who and who's together. Oft far and wide for new delights I range, True sex, and constant to the love of change. Is there within ten miles a troop review'd, An auction of old goods, an interlude By strolling players, an horse-race, or a ball! There to be seen I have an urgent call. The labours of the plough are then forgot, And Thomas mounts the box in liv'ry coat. Scenes odd as these, if Cloe can endure, (And yet these scenes are town in miniature) Come, and reflect on Ranelagh with scorn, Content ev'n here, at least till routs return. ON A FIT of the GOUT. By the Same. Wherefore was man thus form'd with eye sublime, With active joints, to traverse hill or plain, But to contemplate nature in her prime, Lord of this ample world, his fair domain? Why on this various earth such beauty pour'd, But for thy pleasure, man, her sovereign lord? Why does the mantling vine her juice afford Nectareous, but to cheer with cordial taste? Why are the earth and air and ocean stor'd With beast, fish, fowl; if not for man's repast! Yet what avails to me, or taste, or sight, Exil'd from every object of delight? So much I feel of anguish, day and night Tortur'd, benumb'd; in vain the fields to range Me vernal breezes, and mild suns invite: In vain the banquet smokes with kindly change Of delicacies, while on every plate Pain lurks in ambush, and alluring fate. Fool not to know the friendly powers create These maladies in pity to mankind; These abdicated reason reinstate, When lawless appetite usurps the mind; Heaven's faithful centries at the door of bliss Plac'd to deter, or to chastise excess. Weak is the aid of wisdom to repress Passion perverse; philosophy how vain! 'Gainst Circe's cup, enchanting sorceress; Or when the Syren sings her warbling strain. Whate'er or sages teach, or bards reveal, Men still are men, and learn but when they feel. As in some free and well-pois'd common-weal Sedition warns the rulers how to steer, As storms and thunders rattling with loud peal, From noxious dregs the dull horizon clear; So when the mind imbrutes in sloth supine, Sharp pangs awake her energy divine. Cease, then, ah cease, fond mortal, to repine At laws, which nature wisely did ordain; Pleasure, what is it? rightly to define, 'Tis but a short liv'd interval from pain: Or rather each alternately renew'd, Give to our lives a sweet vicissitude. Horace, Ode 14. Book I. imitated in 1746. By the Same. O ship! shall new waves again bear thee to sea? Where, alas! art thou driving? keep steady to shore. Thy sides are left without an oar, And thy shaken mast groans, to rude tempests a prey. Thy tackle all torn, can no longer endure The assaults of the surge that now triumphs and reigns, None of thy sails entire remains, Nor a God to protect in another sad hour. Tho' thy outside bespeaks thee of noble descent, The forest's chief pride, yet thy race and thy name, What are they but an empty name? Wise mariners trust not to gilding and paint. Beware then lest Thou float, uncertain again, The sport of wild winds; late my sorrowful care, And now my fondest wish, beware Of the changeable shoals where the Rhine meets the Main. The Female Right to Literature, in a Letter to a young Lady from Florence. By ? Whilst you, Athenia, with assiduous toil Reap the rich fruits of learning's fertile soil: Now search whate'er historick truth has shewn, And make the wealth of ages past your own; Now crop the blossoms of poetick flow'rs, And range delighted in the Muses bowers; Say, will the sweetest of her sex attend To lines by friendship, not by by flatt'ry penn'd; To lines which tempt not worth with empty praise; But to still greater height that worth would raise; To lines which dare against a world decide, And stem the rage of custom's rapid tide! Come then, Athenia, freely let us scan The coward insults of that tyrant, man. Self-prais'd, and grasping at despotick pow'r, He looks on slav'ry as the female dow'r; To Nature's boon ascribes what force has giv'n, And usurpation deems the gift of heav'n. See the first-peopled East, where Asia sheds Her balmy spices o'er her fertile meads: There, while th'Assyrian stretch'd his wide domain From distant Indus to the Cyprian main, All nature's laws by impious force were broke; The female sex to slav'ry's galling yoke Bow'd their fair necks: from social life confin'd, And all th'exertions of th'enlighten'd mind, Clos'd in a proud Seraglio's wanton bow'rs, The dalliance of a tyrant's looser hours. By kings' examples subjects form their lives, Dependent satraps had their train of wives; Proportion'd pow'r each petty tyrant craves, And each poor female was the slave of slaves. When Persia next o'erturn'd th'Assyrian throne, Destroy'd her tyranny and fix'd its own; The fair distress'd no milder treatment saw, This was indeed th'unalterable law. In future times, whatever masters came, Tyrants were chang'd, but tyranny the same: At length t'accumulate the female woes, The grand impostor Mahomet arose; Swoln with prophetick lyes, he lay'd his plan On the firm basis of the pride of man; “Women, the toys of men, and slaves of lust, “Are but mere moulds to form man's outward crust; “The heavenly spark, that animates the clay, “Of the prime essence that effulgent ray, “Th'immortal soul is all to man confin'd, “Not meanly squander'd on weak woman-kind.” Accursed wretch! by hell's black council driv'n Thus to debase the fairest work of heav'n. And could Religion rear her sacred head Fraught with such doctrines? could such errors spread From western Tangier, and the sun-burnt Moor, To the cold Tartar's ever-frozen shore? Ev'n Greece too not exempt, Greece, once the seat Where Sense and Freedom held the reins of state; Where Force was Reason's hand-maid; where the bands Of Love and Friendship join'd the wedded hands; Where flourish'd once, and flourish still in fame Th'Athenian matron, and the Spartan dame. In Rome too Liberty once reign'd, in Rome The female virtues were allow'd to bloom, And bloom they did: when Cannæ's fatal plain Was heap'd with mountains of the Roman slain, Was there a matron wept her children dead? Was there a matron wept not those that fled? Then when each rumour seem'd the voice of fate, And spoke the victor thund'ring at their gate, Was there one mention'd peace? did they not pour Their wealth, their jewels to the publick store, In emulous haste all pressing to be poor? Alas how chang'd! how are the mighty sunk, From the firm Patriot to the whining Monk! Where Industry secur'd the publick good, Where censors, consuls, and dictators plough'd. Now lazy zealots batten on the spoil, And consecrated Sloth devours the farmer's toil. But oh still worse! where Love and Friendship shone, Domestick Tyranny has fix'd his throne, With all his train of monsters: at his side Swoln with self-flatteries sits stiff-neck'd Pride; Two twin-born fiends his other ear engage, Heart-canker'd Jealousy, and fire-ey'd Rage; In front, his empire's sole support and source, Rattling chains, bars and locks, stalks brutal Force; Whilst pale and shrivel'd, crouch'd beneath the chair, Lies sneaking, conscious Worthlessness; and near Squint-ey'd Suspicion lurks, with self-distracting Fear. Hail, happy Britain, dear parental land, Where Liberty maintains her latest stand! Oh while amidst tyrannick realms I rove, Enamour'd let me pour my filial love Into thy bosom. When the raven wings Of darkness hover o'er me, when the springs Of every outward sense are shut, my soul Thee oft revisits, oft without controul Ranges thy fields delighted, and inhales Friendship's pure joys, and Freedom's healthful gales. But say, Britannia, do thy sons, who claim A birth-right liberty, dispense the same In equal scales? Why then does Custom bind In chains of Ignorance the female mind? Why is to them the bright etherial ray Of science veil'd? Why does each pedant say, “Shield me, propitious powers, nor clog my life “With that supreme of plagues a learned wife. “'Tis man's, with science to expand the soul, “And wing his eagle-flight from pole to pole; “'Tis his to pierce antiquity's dark gloom, “And the still thicker shades of times to come; “'Tis his to guide the pond'rous helm of state, “And bear alone all wisdom's solid weight. “Let woman with alluring graces move “The fondling passions and the baby love; “Be this our only science, be her doom “Fix'd to the toilette, the spinnet and loom.” Tongue-doughty pedant, was Athenia's soul Form'd for these only? Bring th'exactest rule Of judgment to the tryal, prove that e'er Thy school-proud tribe engross'd a greater share Of mental excellence; tho' vernal Youth Justs swell her lovely bosom, yet blest Truth, Offspring of Sense and Industry, has there Long fix'd her residence; and taught the fair Or wisdom's deep recesses to explore, Or on invention's rapid wings to soar Above th'Aonian mount; and can'st thou think That virtues, which exalt the soul, can sink The outward charms? must knowledge give offence? And are the graces all at war with sense? Say, who of all the fair is form'd to move The fondest passions, most ecstatick love, More than Athenia? in her gentle eye Soft innocence and virgin modesty Incessant shine, while still a new-born grace Springs in each speaking feature of her face. Her sprightly wit no forward pertness spoils: No self-assuming air her judgment soils; Still prone to learn, tho' capable to teach, And lofty all her thoughts, but humble all her speech. Proceed, Athenia, let thy growing mind Take ev'ry knowledge in of ev'ry kind: Still on perfection fix thy steady eye, Be ever rising, rise thou ne'er so high. But oh reflect, that in th'advent'rous flight, Thou mount'st a glorious, but a dangerous height: When ev'ry science ev'ry grace shall join, When most thy wit, when most thy beauties shine, When thickest crowds enamour'd press around, When loudest ev'ry tongue thy praise shall sound, When verse too offers incense to thy shrine, And adoration breathes in ev'ry line, Then let my friendly Muse express her care, Then most will danger spread her viewless snare: Then let this truth possess thy inmost soul, “One drop of Vanity may spoil the whole.” Not self-secure on earth can Knowledge dwell, Knowledge the bliss of heav'n and pang of hell, Alike the instrument of good and evil, The attribute of God and of the Devil. Without her, Virtue is a powerless Will; She, without Virtue, is a powerful ill; Does she then join with Virtue, or oppose, She proves the best of Friends, or worst of Foes. O! be they once in happiest union join'd, And be that union in Athenia's mind. On Shakespear's Monument at Stratford upon Avon. By the Same. Great Homer's birth sev'n rival cities claim, Too mighty such monopoly of Fame; Yet not to birth alone did Homer owe His wond'rous worth; what Egypt could bestow, With all the schools of Greece and Asia join'd, Enlarg'd th'immense expansion of his mind. Nor yet unrival'd the Mæonian strain, The Milton. British Eagle, and the Mantuan Swan Tow'r equal heights. But happier Stratford, thou With incontested laurels deck thy brow: Thy Bard was thine unschool'd, and from thee brought More than all Egypt, Greece, or Asia taught. Not Homer's self such matchless honours won; The Greek has Rivals, but thy Shakespear none. A SONG. By the Same. [When fair Serena fair I knew] I When fair Serena fair I knew, By friendship's happy union charm'd; Incessant joys around her flew, And gentle smiles my bosom warm'd. II But when with fond officious care I press'd to breathe my amorous pain, Her lips spoke nought but cold despair, Her eyes shot ice through ev'ry vein. III Thus in Italia's lovely vales The sun his genial vigour yields, Reviving heat each sense regales, And plenty crowns the smiling fields. IV When nearer we approach this ray, High on the Alps' stupendous brow, Surpriz'd we see pale sun-beams play On everlasting hills of snow. CHISWICK. By the Same. The potent Lord, that this bright villa plann'd, Exhibits here a Paradise regain'd; Whate'er of Verdure have Hills, Lawns, or Woods, Whate'er of Splendor, Buildings, Flow'rs, or Floods, Whate'er of Fruits the Trees, of Birds the Air, In blissful union are collected here: All with such harmony dispos'd, as shews, That in the midst the Tree of Knowledge grows. The INDIFFERENT. From the Italian of Metastasio. Thanks, Cloe, thy coquetting art At length hath heal'd my love-sick heart, At length thy slave is free; I feel no tyrant's proud controul, I feel no inmate in my soul, But peace and liberty. No longer now a fierce desire In anger masks its amorous fire, And fiercer burns suppress'd, I blush not when thy name I hear, I meet thee suddenly, and fear No fluttering in my breast. In dreams I ev'ry trifle see, Yet very rarely dream of thee: I wake, nor think about thee: When absent I ne'er wish thee near: And when thou'rt present I not fear, Nor pray to be without thee. I think, hear, talk about thy charms, Nor stoop the head, nor fold the arms; Nay ev'n my wrongs sit easy. And when my favour'd rival's near And eyes me with insulting leer, His triumphs never teaze me. Put on thy looks of cold disdain, Or speak respectful, 'tis in vain, Nor frowns nor smiles can move. Those lips no more have words that bind, Those eyes no more have light to find The path that leads to love. Seasons, which wont to take their dye Of foul or fair, from Cloe's eye, Now their own livery wear. This place I hate, and that I love, The fen's a fen, the grove's a grove, If absent thou, or there. Judge if I speak like one sincere, Still I confess your face is fair, But so are twenty faces; And if plain truth will not offend, You've now some features I could mend, Which once appear'd all graces. Nay more, I own, when from my heart I strove to tug the fatal dart I cut my heart in sunder: But to relieve a constant pain, And to retrieve one's self again, What would one not go-under? The fluttering bird in viscous snare Entangled, willingly will spare For liberty a feather; In time again the feather grows, And wise by danger made, he knows To shun the snare for ever. But still I hear you smiling say, 'Tis sign you've flung their chains away, You take such pains to shew 'em. Why, Cloe, there's a fond delight Our former dangers to recite, And let our neighbours know 'em. After the thunder of the wars, The veteran thus displays his scars, And tells you of his pains; The galley-slave, enslav'd no more, Shews you the shackles which he wore, And where their mark remains. I talk, 'cause talking gives delight, I please myself not Cloe by't, Nor care if she believe; And when myself she deigns to name, Whether she praise my song or blame, I neither joy nor grieve. For me I quit a sickle fair, Cloe has lost a heart sincere, Who first should sing Te deum? You'll never find so true a swain; But women full as false as vain, By dozens one may see 'em. The Triumph of INDIFFERENCE. Being the same ODE, imitated by an unknown Hand. I Thanks, dear coquet! indulgent cheat! Kind heaven, and your more kind deceit, At length have set me free; No more I sigh, and doat, and pine, All ease without, and calm within, In peace and liberty. II Cupid no more has power to scorch, Time sure has robb'd him of his torch, Ne'er was a cooler creature: That name no more has such eclat, No more my heart goes pit-a-pat At sight of each dear feature. III I sleep at night, and sometimes dream, Nor you the fond vexatious theme; I wake, nor think about you: I meet, I leave you, meet again, But feel no mighty joy or pain, Or with you, or without you. IV Now with indifference I chat Of eyes, lips, bubbies, and all that, And laugh at former follies: Joke with my rival when we meet, What eye so keen! what lips so sweet! What skin so soft as Molly's! V Leave then those little torturing arts, You practise on complying hearts; They're all in vain, believe me: Whether those eyes look kind or weep, The pouting, or the smiling lip, Will neither please, nor grieve me. VI From those despotick looks, no more (Once tyrants of each fickle hour) I date my grief and joy: May, tho' you frown, looks sweetly clad; And dull December's mighty sad, Tho' you stand smiling by. VII Yet still (for I am quite sincere) You're mighty pretty,—true, my dear, But, like your pretty sex, You've here and there, and now and then A failing; for like other men, I now can spy defects. VIII Yet once with coward fondness curs'd, My poor weak heart I fear'd would burst At thought of separation: But now despise my feeble chain, And bless the salutary pain That cur'd me of my passion. IX Impatient of his iron cage, The bird thus spends his little rage, And 'scapes with shatter'd wings: But soon with new-fledg'd pinions soars, And hast'ning to his native bow'rs, A joyful welcome sings. X Fond female vanity will say, These long harangues they sure betray A heart that's hankering still: This passion so proclaim'd in song, This tale so pleasing to the tongue, Does it not touch the will? XI Lovers like soldiers, Molly, dwell With pleasure on the horrid tale, When all the danger's o'er: Like other slaves from setters free, We smile with anxious joy, to see The chains which once we wore. XII In kind indulgence to a heart, Engag'd in so severe a part, This sweet revenge I write: Rail, weep, be woman all, for I Lull'd in indifference, defy Your fondness or your spite. XIII A frail false maid I lost, but you A man, fond, gen'rous, and true; Which fortune is the worse? Try all love's mighty empire round, A faithful lover's seldom found; A jilt's a common curse. The Shepherd's Farewel to his Love. Being the same ODE. Translated by Mr. Roderick. Phœbe, thank thy false heart, it has fix'd my repose, The gods have had pity at length on my woes; I feel it, I feel my soul loose from its chain, And at last freedom comes, often dream'd of in vain. The flame is burn'd out, and each passion at rest, Under which love disguis'd still might lurk in my breast; No more, when thou'rt nam'd, the warm blushes arise, No more flutters my heart, when I meet with your eyes. In my sleep now no longer thy image I see, Nor the first of my thoughts, when I wake, is of thee; When from thee, no more of thy absence I plain, When with thee, I feel neither pleasure nor pain. My heart without fondness can muse on thy charms, My past pains I recount, yet no passion alarms; Discompos'd I'm no longer, when tow'rd me you move, And at ease with my rival I talk of my love. Whether haughty thy frown, whether gentle thy strain, In vain thy proud looks, thy fond speeches in vain; Thy false tongue to beguile me no more has the art, No more thy keen eye knows the way to my heart. Whether pensive or cheerful, no longer to you For this are my thanks, or for that my blame due: The gay prospect now pleases, though you are away, And your presence no more can make dreariness gay. Believe me, I still can allow that thou'rt fair, But not that no fair-one can with thee compare; And though beauteous I own thee, yet still in thy face I can now spy a fault, which I once thought a grace. When first the fix'd arrow I pluck'd from my heart, Oh, methought I shou'd die! so severe was the smart: But from pow'r so oppressive to set myself clear, Torments greater than dying with patience I'd bear. When lim'd the poor bird thus with eagerness strains, Nor regrets the lost plume, so his freedom he gains; The loss of his plumage small time will restore, And once try'd the false twig, it can cheat him no more. The old flame, never flatter yourself to believe, While it dwells on my tongue, in my heart still must live; Our dangers, when past, with delight we repeat, What in suffering was pain, to remembrance is sweet. 'Tis thus when the soldier returns from the wars, He fights o'er his old battles, and vaunts of his scars: With pleasure the captive his liberty gain'd The fetters thus shows, which once held him enchain'd. Thus I talk, and I still will talk on while I may, Nor heed I, though you disbelieve what I say: I ask not that Phœbe my talk should approve, Let her too, if she can, talk at ease of my love. An inconstant I leave, a true lover you lose; Which first of us two will have comfort, who knows? This I know—Phœbe ne'er such a true love will find; I can easily meet with a fair as unkind. RIDDLE. By the Same. [Through the close covert of the shady grove] Through the close covert of the shady grove, One summer's day it was my chance to rove, Where, shrouded from the sun's too scorching ray, Stretch'd at her ease, half-slumbering Cloe lay. Occasion so inviting, who could miss? Softly I stole, and snatch'd a sudden kiss. Startled at first, the rising blush display'd The quick resentment of the ruffled maid; Lively display'd—for soon it over past; Such blushing anger never long did last! Quick reconcilement must to rage succeed, Where wrongs ideal solid pleasures breed. Submissive looks my pardon soon obtain'd, And pardon'd love as soon new boldness gain'd. Offending thus, forgiving thus, we lay, Long time entranc'd with the alternate play; 'Till warn'd, too soon, by envious night, we part: The thrilling joy still flutters round my heart; Thought still, tho' fainter, paints the glowing bliss, On fancy's lip still cleaves the rapt'rous kiss. But mark the sad effects of casual love, And tread with caution in the shady grove. In due time, Cloe at my doors appears, A fix'd composure on her brow she wears; And guess the cause: close in her lap conceal'd A lovely twin in either hand she held; And take, she cry'd, these pledges of our love, These fruits you planted in the shady grove. Soft as the downy bloom on Cloe's cheek, Smooth as the polish'd ivory of her neck, Warm as her bosom, white as was her arm, So smooth were they and white, so soft and warm, Pleas'd I receiv'd them for the giver's sake, Heedless what censures strait-lac'd prudes might make. Compliant to my forming hand they grew, And with their size increas'd obedience due, As I direct they take th'appointed bent, With ev'ry motion, ev'ry beck, consent, Whate'er I want, they reach with ready hand, Where-e'er I go, they wait at my command. Now at ease one in my bosom lays; While by my side the other wanton plays; Now this my hand embraces; t'other free, Takes his full swing and plays at liberty. Before me hand in hand sometimes they move, Emblems of friendship, and united love; Sometimes behind my leading steps they trace Still closely knit in brotherly embrace; Anon on either side as guards attend, At once adorn me, and at once defend. Still more and more my love they thus engage, Thus still shall cherish my declining age; And when th'appointed hour of fate shall come, They'll follow still attendant on my tomb. More lasting far than man's soon fading breath, Their love extends beyond the vale of death; They'll hang for ever o'er my much-lov'd bust, Till they themselves, like me, are turn'd to dust. RIDDLE. By the Same. [Torn from the fruitful spot on which I grew] ? Mortalis in unum Quodque caput, vultu mutabilis, albus an ater. Torn from the fruitful spot on which I grew, Me innocent unnumber'd pains pursue; Pains more afflicting, as from man they flow, From parent man! for birth to man I owe. Sometimes on spikes of steel my nerves they rend, Sometimes asunder split from end to end; In boiling cauldrons now immers'd I lie, Now doom'd the rage of drying fires to try: There while in double torment scorch'd and drown'd, Fast tied I writhe the rigid stake around. Last their fierce hate its utmost effort tries With all Barbarian pomp of sacrifice. The purple fillet round my temples wreathes, From every part the scented unguent breathes; O'er my white locks the sacred flower is spread Whilst on the fatal block is plac'd my head. Yet with fix'd constancy I bear my doom; And constancy at last will overcome. From all my tryals I return at length, My worth increas'd, my beauty, and my strength. The suffering martyr thus in torment dies, In sainted state more glorious to arise. And now I re-assume my native state, My torturers now beneath their burden sweat, Slaves in their turn to me, and think it pride If on their subject necks I deign to ride. Yet still my filial duty I retain, Unchang'd by honours, as unmov'd by pain. Still to mankind a friend, I daily shed My warmest blessings on his parent head; Around him still with fond embraces twine, As round the elm her tendrils curls the vine. Nor quit him e'er till he to rest repairs, And every morn renew my constant cares. Ready alike on rich and poor to wait; I suit myself to every different state. With priest in whitish dress array'd I shine, Emblem of purity and truth divine. His solemn face the doctor owes to me, His solemn face, to which he owes his fee. At bench, or bar, I add a dignity To th'upright sentence, or rhetorick plea; Hence without me no judge explains the laws, Nor coifed council pleads the puzzling cause: In fullest floods my bounty showers on them Profuse, descending to the garment's hem. Gorgeous in silken garb I grace the beau; And all around ambrosial fragrance throw; Nor less decorous, tho' with dust o'erspread, When to the camp the valiant warriors lead, Gorgonian terrors to each mien I add, And still their weakest part with care I shade. RIDDLE. By the Same. [My size is large, my shape's uncouth] My size is large, my shape's uncouth, I have neither limb nor feature; Mens hands have form'd my skin so smooth: My guts were made by nature. Nor male nor female is my sex, You'll scarce believe my troth; For when I've told you all my tricks You'll swear 't must needs be both. For oft my master lies with me, His wife I oft enjoy; Yet's she's no whore, no cuckold he, And true to both am I. My cloaths nor women fit, nor men, They're neither coat nor gown; Yet oft both men and maidens, when They're naked, have them on. When I'm upon my legs, I lie, Yet legs in truth I've none; And never am I seen so high To rise as when I'm down. What's oft my belly, is oft my back, And what my feet, my head; And though I'm up, I have a knack Of being still a-bed. Audivere, Lyce, &amp;c. Hor. Book 4. Ode 13. Imitated. By the Same. Lyce, at length my vows are heard, My vows so oft to heaven preferr'd; Welcome, thy silver'd hairs! In vain thy affectation gay To hide the manifest decay, In vain thy youthful airs. If still thy cheeks preserve a blush, With heat of wine, not youth they flush, Unamiable stain! If still thou warblest, harsh the note When trembling age shakes in the throat Th'involuntary strain. Think'st thou can these my love prolong? (Ungrateful blush! untuneful song!) Or rival Hebe's charms? Hebe melodious, Hebe fair, For judgment swells her rapt'rous air, For youth her blushes warms. The rosy cheek, the forehead smooth, Those native ornaments of youth, Once lost, are lost for aye. No art can smooth, no paint repair The furrow'd face; no diamond's glare Give lustre to decay. What now of all which once was thine, Feature, Complexion, Mien divine, Remains the sense to charm? Why now command they not my love? Once could they—even tho' Cloe strove Their empire to disarm. Cloe!—alas, thou much-lov'd name! Thou, full of beauty, full of fame, Found'st an untimely urn! Whilst Lyce, reft of every grace T'enrich th'mind, t'adorn the face, Still lives, the public scorn. The contemptuous satire at the conclusion of the original, is preserved in the English, but a graver turn is given to it, instead of the more ludicrous one of Horace. Whether judiciously or no, may be better determined by any body, than by the author. A SONNET. Imitated from the Spanish of Lopez de Vega. Menagiana tom. iv. p. 176. By the Same. Capricious W? a sonnet needs must have I ne'er was so put to't before:—a Sonnet! Why, fourteen verses must be spent upon it; 'Tis good howe'er t'have conquer'd the first stave. Yet I shall ne'er find rhymes enough by half, Said I, and found myself i'th' midst o'the second. If twice four verses were but fairly reckon'd, I should turn back on th'hardest part and laugh. Thus far with good success I think I've scribbled, And of the twice seven lines have clean got o'er ten. Courage! another 'll finish the first triplet. Thanks to thee, Muse, my work begins to shorten. There's thirteen lines got through driblet by driblet. 'Tis done! count how you will, I warr'nt there's fourteen. SONNETS. By T. E. SONNET I. [O?, whom virtue makes the worthy heir] O?, whom virtue makes the worthy heir Of?'s titles, and of?'s estate, Blest in a wife, whose beauty, though so rare, Is the least grace of all that round her wait, While other youths, sprung from the good and great, In devious paths of pleasure seek their bane, Reckless of wisdom's lore, of birth, or state, Meanly debauch'd, or insolently vain; Through Virtue's sacred gate to Honour's fane You and your fair associate ceaseless climb With glorious emulation, sure to gain A meed, shall last beyond the reign of Time: From your example long may Britain see, Degenerate Britain, what the great should be. SONNET II. [Wisely, O C?, enjoy the present hour] Wisely, O C?, enjoy the present hour, The present hour is all the time we have, High God the rest has plac'd beyond our pow'r, Consign'd, perhaps, to grief—or to the grave. Wretched the man, who toils ambition's slave; Who pines for wealth, or sighs for empty fame; Who rolls in pleasures which the mind deprave, Bought with severe remorse, and guilty shame. Virtue and knowledge be our better aim; These help us Ill to bear, or teach to shun; Let friendship cheer us with her gen'rous flame, Friendship, the sum of all our joys in one: So shall we live each moment fate has giv'n; How long, or short, let us resign to heav'n. SONNET III. [O sprung from worthies, who with counsels wise] To F. K. Esq; O sprung from worthies, who with counsels wise Adorn'd and strengthen'd great Elisa's throne, Who yet with virtuous pride, may'st well despise To borrow praise from merits not thy own. Oft as I view the monumental stone Where our lov'd H?'s cold ashes rest, Musing on joys with him long past and gone, A pleasing sad remembrance fills my breast.— Did the sharp pang we feel for friends deceas'd Unbated last, we must with anguish die; But nature bids its rigour should be eas'd By lenient time, and strong necessity: These calm the passions, and subdue the mind To bear th'appointed lot of human kind. SONNET IV. [C?s, I hop'd the little heaven shall spare] C?s, I hop'd the little heaven shall spare Of my short day, which flits away so fast, And sickness threats with clouds to overcast, In social converse oft with thee to share. Ill-luck for me, that wayward fate should tear Thee from the haven thou had'st gain'd at last, Again to try the toils and dangers past In foreign climates, and an hostile air: Yet duteous to thy country's call attend, Which claims a portion of thy useful years, And back with speed thy course to Britain bend. If, e'er again we meet, perchance should end My dark'ning eve, thou'lt pay some friendly tears, Grateful to him, who liv'd and dy'd thy friend. SONNET V. On a FAMILY-PICTURE. When pensive on that portraiture I gaze, Where my four brothers round about me stand, And four fair sisters smile with graces bland, The goodly monument of happier days; And think, how soon insatiate death, who preys On all, has cropp'd the rest with ruthless hand, While only I survive of all that band, Which one chaste bed did to my father raise; It seems, that like a column left alone, The tott'ring remnant of some splendid fane, 'Scap'd from the fury of the barb'rous Gaul, And wasting Time, which has the rest o'erthrown, Amidst our house's ruins I remain, Single, unprop'd, and nodding to my fall. SONNET VI. [R?, who well hast judg'd the task too hard] R?, who well hast judg'd the task too hard, Of this short life throughout the total day To follow glory's false bewitching ray, Through certain toils, uncertain of reward; A prince's service how should we regard; As service still—though deck'd in livery gay, Disguis'd with titles, gilded o'er with pay, Specious, yet ill to liberty preferr'd. Bounding thy wishes by the golden mean, Nor weakly bartering happiness for show, Wisely thou'st left the busy bustling scene, Where merit seldom has successful been, In C?'s shades to taste the joys, that flow From calm retirement, and a mind serene. SONNET VII. [C?e, with whom, my pilot and my guide] C?e, with whom, my pilot and my guide, Pleas'd I have travers'd thy Sabrina's flood, Both where she foams impetuous soil'd with mud, And where she peaceful rolls her golden tide. Never, O never let ambition's pride (Too oft pretexted with our country's good) And tinsel'd pomp, despis'd when understood, Or thirst of wealth thee from her banks divide. Reflect how calmly, like her infant wave, Flows the clear current of a private life; See the wide publick stream by tempests toss'd, Of ev'ry changing wind the sport, or slave, Soil'd with corruption, vex'd with party strife, Cover'd with wrecks of peace and honour lost. SONNET VIII. [Wo worth the man, who in ill hour assay'd] On the CANTOS of Spenser's Fairy Queen, lost in the Passage from Ireland. Wo worth the man, who in ill hour assay'd To tempt that western frith with vent'rous keel, And seek what heav'n, regardful of our weal, Had hid in fogs, and night's eternal shade. Ill-starr'd Hibernia! well art thou repaid For all the woes, that Britain made thee feel By Henry's wrath, and Pembroke's conquering steel, Who sack'd thy towns, and castles disarray'd: No longer now with idle sorrow mourn Thy plunder'd wealth, or liberties restrain'd, Nor deem their victories thy loss or shame; Severe revenge on Britain in thy turn And ample spoils thy treach'rous waves obtain'd, Which sunk one half of Spenser's deathless fame. SONNET IX. [Peace to thy ashes, to thy mem'ry fame] Peace to thy ashes, to thy mem'ry fame, Bright paragon of merit feminine, In forming whom kind nature did inshrine A mind angelick in a faultless frame; Through ev'ry stage of changing life the same, How did thy bright example ceaseless shine, And ev'ry grace with ev'ry virtue join To raise the virgin's and the matron's name? In thee religion cheerful and serene Unsour'd by superstition, spleen, or pride, Through all the social offices of life To shed its genuine influence was seen; This thy chief ornament, thy surest guide, This form'd the daughter, parent, friend, and wife. SONNET X. [O?, great meed shalt thou receive] To the Author of Observations on the Conversion and Apostleship of St. Paul. O?, great meed shalt thou receive, Great meed of fame, thou and thy learn'd compeer, Who 'gainst the sceptic's doubt, and scorner's sneer, Assert those heav'n-born truths, which you believe. In elder time thus heroes wont t'atchieve Renown, they held the faith of Jesus dear, And round their ivy-crown, or laurell'd spear, Blush'd not religion's olive branch to weave. Thus Raleigh, thus immortal Sidney shone (Illustrious names) in great Elisa's days. Nor doubt his promise firm, that such who own In evil times, undaunted, though alone, His glorious truth, such he will crown with praise, And glad agnize before his Father's throne. SONNET XI. [Young, fair, and good! ah why should young and fair] Young, fair, and good! ah why should young and fair And good be huddled in untimely grave? Must so sweet flow'r so brief a period have, Just bloom and charm, then fade and disappear? Yet our's the loss, who ill alas can spare The bright example, which thy virtues gave; The guerdon thine, whom gracious heav'n did save From longer trial in this vale of care. Rest then, sweet saint, in peace and honour rest, While our true tears bedew thy maiden hearse, Light lie the earth upon thy lovely breast; And let a grateful heart with grief oppress'd To thy dear mem'ry consecrate this verse, Though all too mean for who deserves the best. SONNET XII. [W?, whose dear friendship in the dawning years] W?, whose dear friendship in the dawning years Of undesigning Childhood first began, Through Youth's gay morn with even tenor ran, My noon conducted, and my evening cheers, Rightly dost thou, in whom combin'd appears Whate'er for Public Life completes the Man, With active Zeal strike out a larger plan, No useless friend to Senators and Peers: Me moderate talents and a small estate Fit for Retirement's unambitious shade, Nor envy I who near approach the throne; But joyful see thee mingle with the Great, See thy deserts with due distinction paid, And praise thy lot, contented with my own. SONNET XIII. [Thou, who successive in that honor'd seat] To the Right Hon. Mr. ?, with the foregoing Sonnets. Thou, who successive in that honor'd seat Presid'st, the feuds of jaring Chiefs to 'swage, To check the boist'rous force of Party rage, Raise modest worth, and guide the high debate, Sometimes retiring from the toils of State, Thou turn'st th'instructive Greek or Roman page, Or what our British Bards of later age In scarce inferior numbers can relate: Amid this feast of Mind, when Fancy's Child, Sweet Shakespear, raps the soul to virtuous deed, When Spenser warbling tunes his Doric lays, Or the first Man from Paradise exil'd Great Milton sings, can aught my rustic reed Presume to sound, that may deserve thy praise?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. ON A GROTTO near the Thames, at Twickenham, Composed of Marbles, Spars, and Minerals. By Mr. POPE. Thou who shalt stop, where Thames' translucent wave Shines a broad mirrour through the shadowy cave, Where lingering drops from mineral roofs distill, And pointed crystals break the sparkling rill, Unpolish'd gems no ray on pride bestow, And latent metals innocently glow: Approach. Great Nature studiously behold! And eye the mine without a wish for gold. Approach: But aweful! Lo th'Egerian grott, Where, nobly-pensive, St. John sate and thought; Where British sighs from dying Wyndham stole, And the bright flame was shot thro' Marchmont's soul. Let such, such only, tread this sacred floor, Who dare to love their country, and be poor. HYMN on SOLITUDE. By the late James Thomson, Esq; Author of the Seasons. Hail, ever-pleasing Solitude! Companion of the wise and good! But, from whose-holy, piercing eye, The herd of fools, and villains fly. Oh! how I love with thee to walk! And listen to thy whisper'd talk; Which innocence, and truth imparts, And melts the most obdurate hearts. A thousand shapes you wear with ease, And still in every shape you please; Now rapt in some mysterious dream, A lone philosopher you seem; Now quick from hill to vale you fly, And now you sweep the vaulted sky, And nature triumphs in your eye: Then strait again you court the shade, And pining hang the pensive head. A shepherd next you haunt the plain, And warble forth your oaten strain. A lover now with all the grace Of that sweet passion in your face! Then, soft-divided, you assume The gentle-looking H?d's bloom, As, with her Philomela, she, (Her Philomela fond of thee) Amid the long withdrawing vale, Awakes the rival'd nightingale. A thousand shapes you wear with ease, And still in every shape you please, Thine is th'unbounded breath of morn, Just as the dew-bent rose is born; And while meridian fervors beat, Thine is the woodland's dumb retreat; But chief, when evening scenes decay, And the faint landskip swims away, Thine is the doubtful dear decline. And that best hour of musing thine. Descending angels bless thy train, The virtues of the sage, and swain; Plain Innocence in white array'd, And Contemplation rears the head: Religion with her aweful brow, And rapt Urania waits on you. Oh, let me pierce thy secret cell! And in thy deep recesses dwell: For ever with thy raptures fir'd, For ever from the world retir'd; Nor by a mortal seen, save he A Lycidas, or Lycon be. An ODE ON ÆOLUS's HARP. Æolus's Harp is a musical instrument, which plays with the wind, invented by Mr. Oswald; its properties are fully described in the Castle of Indolence. By the Same. I Ætherial race, inhabitants of air! Who hymn your God amid the secret grove; Ye unseen beings to my harp repair, And raise majestic strains, or melt in love. II Those tender notes, how kindly they upbraid? With what soft woe they thrill the lover's heart? Sure from the hand of some unhappy maid Who dy'd of love, these sweet complainings part. III But hark! that strain was of a graver tone, On the deep strings his hand some hermit throws; Or he the sacred Bard! Jeremiah. who sat alone, In the drear waste, and wept his people's woes. IV Such was the song which Zion's children sung, When by Euphrates' stream they made their plaint: And to such sadly solemn notes are strung Angelic harps, to sooth a dying saint. V Methinks I hear the full celestial choir, Thro' heaven's high dome their aweful anthem raise; Now chanting clear, and now they all conspire To swell the lofty hymn, from praise to praise. VI Let me, ye wand'ring spirits of the wind, Who as wild Fancy prompts you touch the string, Smit with your theme, be in your chorus join'd, For 'till you cease, my Muse forgets to sing. On the Report of a Wooden Bridge to be built at Westminster. By the Same. By Rufus' hall, where Thames polluted flows, Provok'd, the Genius of the river rose, And thus exclaim'd—“Have I, ye British swains, “Have I, for ages, lav'd your fertile plains? “Given herds, and flocks, and villages increase, “And fed a richer than the Golden Fleece? “Have I, ye merchants, with each swelling tide, “Pour'd Afric's treasure in, and India's pride? “Lent you the fruit of every nation's toil? “Made every climate your's, and every soil? “Yet pilfer'd from the poor, by gaming base, “Yet must a Wooden Bridge my waves disgrace? “Tell not to foreign streams the shameful tale, “And be it publish'd in no Gallic vale.” He said;—and plunging to his crystal dome, White o'er his head the circling waters foam. The Choice of HERCULES. A POEM. I Now had the son of Jove mature, attain'd The joyful prime: when youth, elate and gay, Steps into life; and follows unrestrain'd Where passion leads, or prudence points the way. In the pure mind, at those ambiguous years, Or vice, rank weed, first strikes her pois'nous root: Or haply virtue's op'ning bud appears By just degrees; fair bloom of fairest fruit: For, if on youth's untainted thought imprest, The gen'rous purpose still shall warm the manly breast. II As on a day, reflecting on his age For highest deeds now ripe, Alcides sought Retirement; nurse of contemplation sage; Step following step, and thought succeeding thought: Musing, with steady pace the youth pursu'd His walk; and lost in meditation stray'd Far in a lonely vale, with solitude Conversing; while intent his mind survey'd The dubious path of life: before him lay Here Virtue's rough ascent, there Pleasure's flow'ry way. III Much did the view divide his wavering mind: Now glow'd his breast with generous thirst of fame; Now love of ease to softer thoughts inclin'd His yielding soul, and quench'd the rising flame, When, lo! far off two female forms he spies; Direct to him their steps they seem to bear; Both, large and tall, exceeding human size; Both far exceeding human beauty, fair. Graceful, yet each with different grace, they move: This, striking sacred awe; that, softer, winning love. IV The first, in native dignity surpass'd; Artless and unadorn'd she pleas'd the more: Health, o'er her looks, a genuine lustre cast; A vest, more white than new-fall'n snow she wore. August she trod, yet modest was her air; Serene her eye, yet darting heav'nly fire. Still she drew near; and nearer still more fair, More mild appear'd: yet such as might inspire Pleasure corrected with an aweful fear; Majestically sweet, and amiably severe. V The other dame seem'd ev'n of fairer hue; But bold her mien; unguarded rov'd her eye: And her flush'd cheeks confess'd at nearer view The borrow'd blushes of an artful dye. All soft and delicate, with airy swim Lightly she danc'd along; her robe betray'd Thro' the clear texture ev'ry tender limb, Height'ning the charms it only seem'd to shade: And as it flow'd adown, so loose and thin, Her stature shew'd more tall; more snowy-white, her skin. VI Oft with a smile she view'd herself askance; Ev'n on her shade a conscious look she threw; Then all around her cast a careless glance, To mark what gazing eyes her beauty drew. As they came near, before that other maid Approaching decent, eagerly she press'd With hasty step; nor of repulse afraid, With freedom bland the wond'ring youth address'd; With winning fondness on his neck she hung; Sweet as the honey-dew flow'd her enchanting tongue. VII “Dear Hercules, whence this unkind delay? “Dear youth, what doubts can thus distract thy mind? “Securely follow, where I lead the way; “And range thro' wilds of pleasure unconfin'd. “With me retire, from noise, and pain, and care; “Embath'd in bliss, and rapt in endless ease: “Rough is the road to fame, thro' blood and war; “Smooth is my way, and all my paths are peace. “With me retire, from toils and perils free; “Leave honour to the wretch! Pleasures were made for thee. VIII “Then will I grant thee all thy soul's desire; “All that may charm thine ear, and please thy sight: “All that thy thought can frame, or wish require, “To steep thy ravish'd senses in delight. “The sumptuous feast, enhanc'd with music's sound; “Fittest to tune the melting soul to love: “Rich odours, breathing choicest sweets around; “The fragrant bow'r, cool fountain, shady grove: “Fresh flowers, to strew thy couch, and crown thy head; “Joy shall attend thy steps, and ease shall smooth thy bed. IX “These will I, freely, constantly supply; “Pleasures, not earn'd with toil, nor mix'd with woe: “Far from thy rest repining want shall fly; “Nor labour bathe in sweat thy careful brow. “Mature the copious harvest shall be thine; “Let the laborious hind subdue the soil: “Leave the rash soldier spoils of war to win; “Won by the soldier thou shalt share the spoil: “These softer cares my blest allies employ, “New pleasures to invent; to wish, and to enjoy.” X Her winning voice the youth attentive caught: He gaz'd impatient on the smiling maid; Still gaz'd, and listen'd: then her name besought: “My name, fair youth, is Happiness, she said. “Well can my friends this envy'd truth maintain: “They share my bliss; they best can speak my praise: “Tho' slander call me Sloth—detraction vain! “Heed not what Slander, vain detractor, says: “Slander, still prompt true merit to defame; “To blot the brightest worth, and blast the fairest name.” XI By this, arriv'd the fair majestic maid: (She all the while, with the same modest pace, Compos'd, advanc'd.) “Know, Hercules,” she said With manly tone, “thy birth of heav'nly race; “Thy tender age that lov'd instruction's voice, “Promis'd thee generous, patient, brave and wise; “When manhood should confirm thy glorious choice: “Now expectation waits to see thee rise. “Rise, youth! Exalt thyself, and me: approve “Thy high descent from heav'n; and dare be worthy Jove. XII “But what truth prompts, my tongue shall not disguise; “The steep ascent must be with toil subdu'd: “Watching and cares must win the lofty prize “Propos'd by heav'n; true bliss, and real good. “Honour rewards the brave and bold alone; “She spurns the timorous, indolent, and base: “Danger and toil stand stern before her throne; “And guard (so Jove commands) the sacred place. “Who seeks her must the mighty cost sustain, “And pay the price of fame; labour, and care, and pain. XIII “Wou'dst thou engage the gods peculiar care? “O Hercules, th'immortal powers adore! “With a pure heart, with sacrifice and pray'r “Attend their altars; and their aid implore. “Or wou'dst thou gain thy country's loud applause, “Lov'd as her father, as her god ador'd? “Be thou the bold assertor of her cause; “Her voice, in council; in the fight, her sword. “In peace, in war, pursue thy country's good: “For her, bare thy bold breast; and pour thy generous blood. XIV “Wou'dst thou, to quell the proud and lift th'opprest, “In arts of war and matchless strength excel? “First conquer thou thyself. To ease, to rest, “To each soft thought of pleasure, bid farewel. “The night alternate, due to sweet repose, “In watches waste; in painful march, the day: “Congeal'd, amidst the rigorous winter's snows; “Scorch'd, by the summer's thirst-inflaming ray. “Thy harden'd limbs shall boast superior might: “Vigour shall brace thine arm, resistless in the fight.” XV “Hear'st thou, what monsters then thou must engage; “What dangers, gentle youth, she bids thee prove? (Abrupt says Sloth) “ill fit thy tender age “Tumult and wars; fit age, for joy and love. “Turn, gentle youth, to me, to love and joy! “To these I lead: no monsters here shall stay “Thine easy course; no cares thy peace annoy: “I lead to bliss a nearer, smoother way. “Short is my way; fair, easy, smooth, and plain: “Turn, gentle youth! With me eternal pleasures reign.” XVI “What pleasures, vain mistaken wretch, are thine! (Virtue with scorn reply'd:) “who sleep'st in ease “Insensate; whose soft limbs the toil decline “That seasons bliss, and makes enjoyment please. “Draining the copious bowl, ere thirst require; “Feasting, ere hunger to the feast invite: “Whose tasteless joys anticipate desire; “Whom luxury supplies with appetite: “Yet Nature loaths; and you employ in vain “Variety and art to conquer her disdain. XVII “The sparkling nectar, cool'd with summer snows; “The dainty board, with choicest viands spread; “To thee are tasteless all! Sincere repose “Flies from thy flow'ry couch and downy bed. “For thou art only tir'd with indolence: “Nor is thy sleep, with toil and labour bought: “Th'imperfect sleep that lulls thy languid sense “In dull oblivious interval of thought: “That kindly steals th'inactive hours away “From the long, ling'ring space, that lengthens out the day. XVIII “From bounteous nature's unexhausted stores “Flows the pure fountain of sincere delights: “Averse to her, you waste the joyless hours; “Sleep drowns thy days, and riot rules thy nights. “Immortal tho' thou art, indignant Jove “Hurl'd thee from heaven, th'immortals blissful place; “For ever banish'd from the realms above, “To dwell on earth, with man's degenerate race: “Fitter abode! On earth alike disgrac'd; “Rejected by the wise, and by the fool embrac'd. XIX “Fond wretch, that vainly weenest all delight “To gratify the sense reserv'd for thee! “Yet the most pleasing object to the sight, “Thine own fair action, never didst thou see. “Tho' lull'd with softest sounds thou liest along; “Soft music, warbling voices, melting lays; “Ne'er did'st thou hear, more sweet than sweetest song “Charming the soul, thou ne'er didst hear thy praise! “No—to thy revels let the fool repair: “To such, go smooth thy speech; and spread thy tempting snare. XX “Vast happiness enjoy thy gay allies! “A youth of follies; and old age, of cares: “Young, yet enervate; old, yet never wise; “Vice wastes their vigour, and their mind impairs. “Vain, idle, delicate, in thoughtless ease “Reserving woes for age their prime they spend; “All wretched, hopeless, in the evil days “With sorrow to the verge of life they tend. “Griev'd, with the present; of the past, asham'd: “They live, and are despis'd: they die, nor more are nam'd. XXI “But with the gods, and godlike men, I dwell: “Me, his supreme delight, th'almighty Sire “Regards well-pleas'd: whatever works excel, “All or divine or human, I inspire. “Counsel with strength, and industry with art, “In union meet conjoin'd, with me reside: “My dictates arm, instruct, and mend the heart; “The surest policy, the wisest guide. “With me, true friendship dwells: she deigns to bind “Those generous souls alone, whom I before have join'd. XXII “Nor need my friends the various costly feast; “Hunger to them th'effects of art supplies; “Labour prepares their weary limbs to rest; “Sweet is their sleep: light, chearful, strong they rise. “Thro' health, thro' joy, thro' pleasure and renown, “They tread my paths; and by a soft descent, “At length to age all gently sinking down, “Look back with transport on a life well-spent: “In which, no hour flew unimprov'd away; “In which, some generous deed distinguish'd every day. XXIII “And when, the destin'd term at length compleat, “Their ashes rest in peace; eternal Fame “Sounds wide their praise: triumphant over fate, “In sacred song, for ever lives their name. “This, Hercules, is happiness! Obey “My voice, and live. Let thy celestial birth “Lift, and enlarge, thy thoughts. Behold the way “That leads to fame; and raises thee from earth “Immortal! Lo, I guide thy steps. Arise, “Pursue the glorious path; and claim thy native skies.” XXIV Her words breathe fire celestial, and impart New-vigour to his soul, that sudden caught The generous flame: with great intent his heart Swells full; and labours with exalted thought: The mist of error from his eyes dispell'd, Thro' all her fraudful arts in clearest light Sloth in her native form he now beheld; Unveil'd, she stood confess'd before his sight; False Siren!—All her vaunted charms, that shone So fresh erewhile, and fair: now wither'd, pale, and gone. XXV No more, the rosy bloom in sweet disguise Masks her dissembled looks: each borrow'd grace Leaves her wan cheek; pale sickness clouds her eyes Livid and sunk, and passions dim her face. As when fair Iris has awhile display'd Her watry arch, with gaudy painture gay; While yet we gaze, the glorious colours fade, And from our wonder gently steal away: Where shone the beauteous phantom erst so bright, Now lowers the low-hung cloud; all gloomy to the sight. XXVI But Virtue more engaging all the while Disclos'd new charms; more lovely, more serene Beaming sweet influence. A milder smile Soften'd the terrors of her lofty mien. “Lead, goddess, I am thine! (transported cry'd Alcides:) “O propitious pow'r, thy way “Teach me! possess my soul; be thou my guide: “From thee, O never, never let me stray!” While ardent thus the youth his vows address'd; With all the goddess fill'd, already glow'd his breast. XXVII The heav'nly maid; with strength divine endu'd His daring soul; there all her pow'rs combin'd: Firm constancy, undaunted fortitude, Enduring patience, arm'd his mighty mind. Unmov'd in toils, in dangers undismay'd, By many a hardy deed and bold emprize, From fiercest monsters, thro' her pow'rful aid, He free'd the earth: thro' her he gain'd the skies. 'Twas Virtue plac'd him in the blest abode; Crown'd with eternal youth; among the Gods, a God. An ODE. TO THE People of GREAT BRITAIN. In Imitation of the Sixth Ode of the Third Book of Horace. Written in 1746. I. Briton! the thunder of the wrath divine, Due to thy fathers crimes, and long with-held from thine, Shall burst with tenfold rage on thy devoted head; Unless with conscious terrors aw'd, By meek, heart-struck repentance led, Suppliant thou fall before th'offended God: If haply yet thou may'st avert his ire; And stay his arm out-stretch'd to launce the avenging fire. II. Did not high God of old ordain, When to thy grasp he gave the scepter of the main, That empire in this favour'd land, Fix'd on religion's solid base should stand? When from thy struggling neck he broke Th'inglorious, galling, papal yoke, Humbled the pride of haughty Spain, And free'd thee by a woman-hero's hand; He then confirm'd the strong degree: “Briton, be virtuous and be free; “Be truth, be sanctify thy guide: “Be humble: fear thy God; and fear thou none beside.” III. Oft has th'offended Pow'r his rising anger shown: Led on by his avenging hand Rebellion triumphs in the land: Twice have her barbarous sons our war-train'd hosts o'erthrown. They fell a cheap inglorious prey; Th'ambitious victor's boast was half supprest, While heav'n-bred fear, and wild dismay, Unman'd the warrior's heart, and reign'd in every breast. IV. Her arms to foreign lands Britannia bore; Her arms, auspicious now no more! With frequent conquests where the fires were crown'd; The sons ill-fated fell, and bit the hostile ground: The tame, war-trading Belgian fled, While in his cause the Briton bled: The Gaul stood wond'ring at his own success; Oft did his hardiest bands their wonted fears confess, Struck with dismay, and meditating flight; While the brave foe still urg'd th'unequal fight, While William, with his Father's ardour fir'd, Through all th'undaunted host the generous flame inspir'd! V. But heavier far the weight of shame That sunk Britannia's naval fame: In vain she spreads her once-victorious sails; Or fear, or rashness, in her chiefs prevails; And wildly these prevent, those basely shun the fight; Content with humble praise, the foe Avoids the long impending blow; Improves the kind escape, and triumphs in his flight. VI. The monstrous age, which still increasing years debase, Which teems with unknown crimes, and genders new disgrace, First, unrestrained by honour, faith, or shame, Confounding every sacred name, The hallow'd nuptial bed with lawless lust profan'd: Deriv'd from this polluted source The dire corruption held its course Through the whole canker'd race, and tainted all the land. VII. The rip'ning maid is vers'd in every dangerous art, That ill adorns the form while it corrupts the heart: Practis'd to dress, to dance, to play, In wanton mask to lead the way, To move the pliant limbs, to roll the luring eye; With folly's gayest partizans to vye In empty noise and vain expence; To celebrate with flaunting air The midnight revels of the fair; Studious of ev'ry praise, but virtue, truth, and sense. VIII. Thus lesson'd in intrigue her early thought improves, Nor meditates in vain forbidden loves: Soon the gay nymph in Cyprus' train shall rove Free and at large amidst th'Idalian grove; Or haply jealous of the voice of fame, Mask'd in the matron's sober name, With many a well-dissembled wile The kind, convenient husband's care beguile: More deeply vers'd in Venus' mystic lore, Yet for such meaner arts too lofty and sublime, The proud, high-born, patrician whore, Bears unabash'd her front; and glories in her crime. IX. Hither from city and from court The votaries of love resort; The rich, the great, the gay, and the severe; The pension'd architect of laws; The patriot, loud in virtue's cause; Proud of imputed worth, the peer: Regardless of his faith, his country, or his name, He pawns his honour and estate; Nor reckons at how dear a rate He purchases disease, and servitude, and shame. X. Not from such dastard sires, to every virtue lost, Sprung the brave youth which Britain once could boast: Who curb'd the Gaul's usurping sway, Who swept th'unnumber'd hosts away, In Agincourt, and Cressy's glorious plain; Who dy'd the seas with Spanish blood, Their vainly-vaunted fleets subdu'd, And spread the mighty wreck o'er all the vanquish'd main. XI. No;—'twas a generous race, by worth transmissive known: In their bold breast their fathers spirit glow'd: In their pure veins rheir mothers virtue flow'd: They made hereditary praise their own. The sire his emulous offspring led The rougher paths of fame to tread; The matron train'd their spotless youth In honour, sanctity, and truth; Form'd by th'united parents care, The sons, tho' bold, were wise; the daughters chaste, tho' fair. XII. How Time, all-wasting, ev'n the worst impairs, And each foul age to dregs still fouler runs! Our sires, more vicious ev'n than theirs, Left us, still more degenerate heirs, To spawn a baser brood of monster-breeding sons. PSYCHE: or the GREAT METAMORPHOSIS. A POEM, written in Imitation of Spenser, I Where early Phœbus sheds his milder beams, The happy gardens of Adonis lay: There Time, well pleas'd to wonne, a youth beseems. Ne yet his wings were fledg'd, ne locks were grey; Round him in sweet accord the Seasons play With fruits and blossoms meint, in goodly gree; And dancing hand in hand rejoice the lea. Sick gardens now no mortal wight can see, Ne mote they in my simple verse descriven be. II The temper'd clime full many a tree affords; Those many trees blush forth with ripen'd fruite; The blushing fruite to feast invites the birds; The birds with plenteous feasts their strength recruite; And warble songs more sweet than shepherd's flute. The gentle stream that roll'd the stones among, Charm'd with the place, almost forgot its suite; But list'ning and responding to the song, Loit'ring, and winding often, murmured elong. III Here Panacea, here Nepenthe grew, Here Polygon, and each ambrosial weed; Whose vertues could decayed health renew, And, answering exhausted nature's need, Mote eath a mortal to immortal feed. Here lives Adonis in unfading youth; Celestial Venus grants him that rich meed, And him successive evermore renew'th, In recompence for all his faithful love and truth. IV Not she, I ween, the wanton queen of love, All buxom as the waves from whence she rose, With her twin sons, who idly round her rove, One Eros hight, the other Anteros; Albeit brothers, different as foes: This sated, sullen, apt for bickerment; That hungry, eager, fit for derring-does. That flies before, with scorching flames ybrent; This foll'wing douts those flames with peevish discontent. V Celestial Venus does such ribaulds shun, Ne dare they in her purlues to be seen; But Cupid's torch, fair mother's fairest son, Shines with a steady unconsuming sheen; Not fierce, yet bright, coldness and rage between. The backs of lyons fellonest he strod; And lyons tamely did themselves amene; On nature's wild full sov'reignly he rod; Wild natures, chang'd, confess'd the mild puissant god. VI A beauteous Fay, or heav'n-descended spright, Sprung from her sire, withouten female's aid, (As erst Minerva did) and Psyche hight, In that inclosure happy sojourn made. No art some heel'd uncomelyness betray'd, But nature wrought her many-colour'd stole; Ne tarnish'd like an Æthiopian maid, Scorch'd with the suns that ore her beauties roll; Ne faded like the dames who bleach beneath the pole. VII Nor shame, nor pride of borrow'd substance wrought Her gay embroidery and ornament: But she who gave the gilded insect's coat Spun the soft silk, and spread the various teint: The gilded insect's colours yet were feint To those which nature for this fairy wove. Our grannums thus with diff'rent dies besprent, Adorn'd in naked majesty the grove, Charm'd our great sires, and warm'd our frozen clime to love. VIII On either side, and all adown her back, With many a ring at equal distance plac'd, Contrary to the rest, was heben black, With shades of green, quick changing as she pass'd, All were on ground-work of bright gold orecast. The black gave livelood to the greenish hue, The green still deep'd the heben ore it lac'd; The gold, that peep'd atween and then withdrew, Gave lustre to them both, and charm'd the wond'ring view. IX It seem'd like arras, wrought with cunning skill, Where kindly meddle colours, light, and shade; Here flows the flood; there rising wood or hill Breaks off its course; gay verdure dies the mead. The stream, depeinten by the glitt'rand braid, Emong the hills now winding seems to hide; Now shines unlook'd for thro' the op'ning glade, Now in full torrent pours its golden tyde; Hills, woods, and meads refresh'd, rejoicing by its side. X Her Cupid lov'd, whom Psyche lov'd again, He, like her parent and her belamour, Sought how she mote in sickerness remain, From all malengine safe, and evil stour. “Go tender cosset, said he, forray ore “These walks and lawnds; thine all these buskets are; “Thine ev'ry shrub, thine ev'ry fruite and flower: “But oh! I charge thee, love, the rose forbear; “For prickles sharp do arm the dang'rous rosiere. XI “Prickles will pain, and pain will banish love: “I charge thee, Psyche, then the rose forbear. “When faint and sick, thy languors to remove, “To yon ambrosial shrubs and plants repair; “Thou weetest not what med'cines in them are: “What wonders follow their repeated use “N'ote thy weak sense conceive, should I declare; “Their labour'd balm, and well-concocted juice, “New life, new forms, new thews, new joys, new worlds produce. XII “Thy term of tryal past with constancy, “That wimpling slough shall fall like filth away; “On pinions broad, uplifted to the sky, “Thou shalt, astert, thy stranger self survey. “Together, Psyche, will we climb and play; “Together wander through the fields of air, “Beyond where suns and moons mete night and day, “I charge thee, O my love, the rose forbear, “If thou wouldst scathe avoid. Psyche, forewarn'd, beware!” XIII “How sweet thy words to my enchanted ear! (With grateful, modest confidence she said) “If Cupid speak, I could for ever hear: “Trust me, my love, thou shalt be well obey'd. “What rich purveyance for me hast thou made, “The prickly rose alone denied! the rest “In full indulgence giv'n! 'twere to upbraid “To doubt compliance with this one request: “How small, and yet how kind, Cupid, is thy beheast! XIV “And is that kindness made an argument “To raise me still to higher scenes of bliss? “Is the acceptance of thy goodness meant “Merit in me for farther happiness? “No merit and no argument, I wiss, “Is there besides in me unworthy maid: “Thy gift the very love I bear thee is. “Trust me, my love, thou shalt be well obey'd; “To doubt compliance here, Cupid, were to upbraid.” XV Withouten counterfesance thus she spoke; Unweeting of her frailty. Light uprose Cupid on easy wings: yet tender look, And oft reverted eye on her bestows; Fearful, but not distrustful of her vows. And mild regards she back reflects on him: With aching eye pursues him as he goes; With aching heart marks each diminish'd limb; Till indistinct, diffus'd, and lost in air he seem. XVI He went to set the watches of the east, That none mote rush in with the tyde of wind: He went to Venus to make fond request From fleshly ferm to loosen Psyche's mind, And her eftsoons transmew. She forelore pin'd; And mov'd for solace to the glassy lake, To view the charms that had his heart entwin'd. She saw, and blush'd and smil'd; then inly spake: “These charms I cannot chuse but love, for Cupid's sake.” XVII But sea-born Venus 'gan with envy stir At bruite of their great happiness; and sought How she might wreak her spight: then call'd to her Her sons, and op'd what rankled in her thought; Asking who'd venture ore the mounds to vau't To breed them scathe unwares; to damp the joy Of blissful Venus, or to bring to nought The liefest purpose of her darling boy, Or urge them both their minion Psyche to destroy. XVIII Eros recul'd, and noul'd the work atchieve. “Behold is th'attempt, said he, averse from love: “If love inspires I could derreign to reave “His spear from Mars, his levin-brond from Jove.” Him Anteros, sneb'd surly. “Galless dove! “Than love's, spight's mightier prowess understond: “If spight inspires I dare all dangers prove: “And if successful, stand the levin-brond, “When hurlen angry forth from Jove's avenging hond.” XIX He said, and deffly t'wards the gardens flew; Horribly smiling at his foul emprise. When, nearer still and nearer as he drew, Unsufferable brightness wounds his eyes Forth beaming from the crystal walls; he tries Arrear to move, averted from the blaze. But now no longer the pure æther buoys His grosser body's disproportion'd peaze; Down drops, plumb from his tow'ring path, the treachor base. XX So ore Avernus, or the Lucrine lake, The wistless bird pursues his purpos'd flight: Whether by vapours noy'd that thenceforth break, Or else deserted by an air too light, Down tumbles the fowl headlong from his height. So Anteros astonied fell to ground, Provok'd, but not accoid at his straunge plight. He rose, and wending coasts it round and round To find unguarded pass, hopeless to leap the mound. XXI As on the margin of a stream he stood, Slow rolling from that paradise within, A snake's out-case untenanted he view'd: Seizing the spoil, albeit it worthless been, He darts himself into the vacant skin. In borrow'd gear, th'exulting losel glides, Whose faded hues with joy flush bright again; Triumphant ore the buoyant flood he rides; And shoots th'important gulph, borne on the gentle tydes. XXII So shone the brazen gates of Babylon; Armies in vain her muniments assail: So strong, no engines could them batter down: So high, no ladders could the ramparts scale; So flank'd with tow'rs, besiegers n'ote avail; So wide, sufficient harvests they enclose: But where might yields, there stratagems prevail. Faithless Euphrates thro' the city flows, And thro' his channel pours the unexpected foes. XXIII He sails along in many a wanton spire; Now floats at length, now proudly rears his crest: His sparkling eyes and scales, instinct with fire, With splendor as he moves, the waves ore kest: And the waves gleam beneath his flaming breast. As through the battle, set in full array, When the sun walks in radiant brightness dress'd; His beams that on the burnish'd helmets play, The burnish'd helms reflect, and spread unusual day. XXIV So on he fares, and stately wreaths about, In semblaunce like a seraph glowing bright; But without terror flash'd his lightning out, More to be wonder'd at, than to affright. The backward stream soon led the masker right To the broad lake, where hanging ore the flood (Narcissus like, enamour'd with the sight Of his own beauties) the fond Pysche stood, To mitigate the pains of lonely widowhood. XXV Unkenn'd of her, he raught th'embroider'd bank; And through the tangled flourets weft aside To where a rosiere by the river dank, Luxuriant grew in all its blowing pride, Not far from Psyche; arm'd with scaly hide He clamb the thorns, which no impression make; His glitt'ring length, with all its folds untied, Plays floating ore the bush: then silence brake, And thus the nympth, astonish'd at his speech, bespake. XXVI “O fairest, and most excellent compleat “In all perfections, sov'reign queen of nature! “The whole creation bowing at thy feet “Submissive pays thee homage! wond'rous creature, “If aught created thou! for every feature “Speaks thee a goddess issued from the skie; “Oh! let not me offend, unbidden waiter, “At aweful distance gazing thus! But why “Should gazing thus offend? or how unbidden I? XXVII “The sun that wakes those flourets from their beds, “Or opes these buds by his soft influence, “Is not offended that they peep their heads, “And shew they feel his pow'r by their quick sense, “Off'ring at his command, their sweet incense; “Thus I, drawn here, by thy enliv'ning rays, “(Call not intrusion my obedience!) “Perforce, yet willing thrall, am come to gaze, “To pay my homage meet, and bask in beauty's blaze.” XXVIII Amaz'd she stood, nor could recover soon: From contemplation suddenly abraid: Starting at speech unusual: yet the tune Struck sootly on her ear, and concert made With her own thoughts. Nor with less pleasure stray'd Her eyes delighted o'er his glossy skin; Yet frighted at the thorn on which he play'd: Pleasure with horror mixt! she hung between Suspended; yields, recoils, uncertain where to lin. XXIX At length she spoke: “Reptile, no charms I know “Such as you mention: yet whate'er they are, “(And nill I lessen what the gods bestow) “Their is the gift, and be the tribute their! “For them these beauties I improve with care, “Intent to them alone from eve to morn. “But reed me, reptile, whence this wonder rare, “That thou hast speech, as if to reason born? “And how, unhurt you sport on that forbidden thorn?” XXX “Say, why forbidden thorn? the foe replied: “To every reptile, every insect free, “Has malice harsh to thee alone denied “The fragrance of the rose enjoy'd by me?” “—'Twas love, not malice, form'd the kind decree, Half-wroth, she cried:) “Thine all these buskets are, “Thine fruit and flow'r, were Cupid's words to me: “But oh? I charge thee, love, the rose forbear; “For prickles sharp do arm the dang'rous rosiere. XXXI “Prickles will pain, and pain will banish love: “I charge thee, Psyche, then the rose forbear. “When faint and sick, thy languors to remove, “To yon ambrosial shrubs, and plants repair; “Thou weetest not what med'cines in them are. “What wonders follow their repeated use “N'ote thy weak sense conceive, should I declare: “Their labour'd balm, and well-concocted juice, “New life, new forms, new thews, new joys, new worlds produce. XXXII “Thy term of tryal past with constancy, “Thy wimpling slough shall fall like filth away; “On pinions broad up-lifted to the skie, “Thou shalt, astert, thy stranger self survey. “Together, Psyche, will we climb and play; “Together wander through the fields of air, “Beyond where suns and moons mete night and day. “I charge thee, O my love, the rose forbear, “If thou wouldst scathe avoid, Psyche, forewarn'd, beware!” XXXIII Out burst the frannion into open laugh: She blush'd, and frown'd at his uncivil mirth. Then, soften'd to a smile, as hiding half What mote offend if boldly utter'd forth, He seem'd t'assay to give his answer birth: But stop'd; and chang'd his smiles to looks of ruth, “Is this (quoth he) fit guerdon for thy worth? “Does Cupid thus impose upon thy youth? “Dwells then in heav'n such envy, void of love and truth? XXXIV “Is this the instance of his tenderness, “To envy Psyche what to worms is given? “To cut her off from present happiness “With feign'd reversion of a promis'd heav'n? “By threat'nings false from true enjoyments driven! “How innocent the thorn to touch, he knows: “Where are my wounds? or where th'avenging levin? “How softly blush these colours of the rose? “How sweet (and div'd into the flow'r) its fragrance flows? XXXV “Disadvantageous are thy terms of tryal; “No longer Psyche then the rose forbear. “What is to recompence the harsh denyal, “But dreams of wand'ring thro' the fields of air. “And joys, I know not what, I know not where! “As eath, on leafy pinions borne the tree “Mote rush into the skies, and flutter there, “As thou soar yon, and quit thy due degree: “Thou for this world wert made: this world was made for thee. XXXVI “In vain you'd fly to yonder shrubs and plants; “Bitter their taste, and worthless their effect: “Here is the polychrest for all thy wants; “No panacea, like the rose, expect. “Mute as my fellow-brutes, as them abject “And reasonless was I, till haply woke “By tasting of the rose, (O weak neglect “In thee the while!) the dawn of sapience broke “On my admiring soul, I reason'd, and I spoke. XXXVII “Nor this the only change; for soon I found “The brisker spirits flow in fuller tyde; “And more than usual lustre spread around; “Such virtue has the rose, in me well tried. “But wise, I ween, thy lover has denied “Its use to thee; I join him too: beware “The dang'rous rose.—For such thy beauty's pride “'Twere death to gaze on, if improv'd!—Forbear “To sharp that wit, too keen!—Touch not the rosiere.” XXXVIII Uncheckt, indulg'd, her growing passions rise: Wonder, to see him safe, and hear his telling; Ambition vain, to be more fair and wise; And rage, at Cupid's misconceiv'd false dealing: Various the gusts, but, all one way impelling, She plung'd into the bosom of the tree, And snatch'd the rose, no dreaded pain or quelling. Off drops the snake, nor farther staid to see; But rush'd into the flood, and vanish'd presently. XXXIX Full many a thorn her tender body rent; Full many a thorn within the wounds remain, And throbbing cause continual dreriment: While gory drops her dainty form distain. She wishes her lost innocence again, And her lost peace, lost charms, lost love to find; But shame upbraids her with a wish so vain: Despair succeeded, and aversion blind; Pain fills her tortur'd sense, and horror clouds her mind. XL Her bleeding, faint, disorder'd, woe-begon, Stretcht on the bank beside the fatal thorn, Venus who came to seek her with her son, Beheld. She stop'd: And albe heav'nly born, Ruthful of others woe, began to mourn. The loss of Venus' smiles sick nature found: As frost-nipt drops the bloom, the birds forelorn Sit hush'd, the faded sun spreads dimness round; The clatt'ring thunders crash, and earthquakes rock the ground. XLI Then arming with a killing frown her brow; “Die, poor unhappy”—Cupid suppliant broke Th'unfinish'd sentence; and with dueful bow Beg'd her to doff the keenness of her look, Which nature feeling to her center shook. “Then how should Psyche bear it? Spare the maid; “'Tis plain that Anteros his spight has wroke; “Shall vengeance due to him, on her be laid? “Oh! let me run, and reach th'ambrosial balms,” he said. XLII “Ah what would Cupid ask?” the queen replies; “Can all those balms restore her peace again? “Wouldst thou a wretched life immortalize; “Wouldst thou protract by potent herbs, her pain? “Love bids her die: thy cruel wish restrain— “Why then (quoth he) in looms of fate were wove “The lives of those, in long successive train, “From her to spring, thro' yon bright tracts to rove? “Due to the skyes, and meant to shine in fields above? XLIII “Say, would thy goodness envy them the light “Appointed for them, or the good prevent “Foreseen from them to flow? eracing quite “The whole creation thro' avengement? “One only species from its order rent, “The whole creation shrivels to a shade.— “—Better all vanish'd, said she, than be meint “In wild confusion; through free will misled, “And tempted to go wrong from punishment delay'd.” XLIV “Let me that exemplary vengeance bear, (Benign return'd her amiable son:) “Justice on her would lose its aim; severe “In vain, productive of no good; for none “Could by that desolating blow be won. “So falls each generous purpose of the will “Correct, extinguish'd by abortion: “Whence justice would its own intendments spill; “And cut off virtue, by the stroke meant vice to kill. XLV “Yet lest impunity should forehead give “To vice, in me let guilt adopted find “A victim; here awhile vouchsafe me live “Thy proof of justice, mixt with mercy kind!” “—Oh! strange request (quoth she) of pity blind! “How shouldst thou suffer, who didst ne'er offend? “How canst thou bear to be from me disloin'd? “To wander here, where nature 'gins to wend “To waste and wilderness, and pleasures have an end?” XLVI “You, Venus, suffer, (said she) when you strike “Not for your own, but others foul offence: “Why not permitted I to do the like, “When greater good, I see, will coul from thence? “That greater good orepays all punishments; “And makes my suff'rings, pleasure: if they prove “A means to conquer Anteros, dispense “Healings to Psyche's wounds, regain her love, “And lead her, with her happy sons, to realms above.” XLVII “To thy intreaties Psyche's life I give, (Replied th'indulgent mother to her son;) “But yet deform'd, and minish'd let her live; “'Till thou shalt grant a better change foredone; “Nor shall that change, but thro' death gates be won. “This meed be thine, ore her and hers to reign! “Already Nature puts her horrors on: “Away!—I to my bow'r of bliss again! “Thou to thy task of love, and voluntary pain.” XLVIII She went; and like a shifted stage, the scene Vanish'd at once; th'ambrosial plants were lost; The jarring seasons brought on various teen; Each sought, each seeking, each by other crost. Young spring to summer flies from winter's frost; While sweltry summer thirsts for autumn's bowl, Which autumn holds to winter; winter tost With scorn away, young spring inflames his soul: Still craving, never pleas'd, thus round and round they roll. XLIX Th'inclement airs bind up the sluggish soil; The sluggish soil the toilsome hand requires; Yet thankless pays with sour harsh fruits the toil; Ne willing yields, but ragged thorns and briers. Birds, birds pursue; as hunger's rage inspires: Their sweetest songs are now but songs of woe. Here from th'encroaching shore the wave retires: There hoarse floods roar; impetuous torrents flow; Invade the land, and the scarce harvests overthrow. L Stretcht on the bank eftsoons th'inviting form Of Psyche faded; brac'd up lank and slim, Her dwindled body shrunk into a worm: Her make new moulded, chang'd in ev'ry limb; Her colours only left, all pale and dim: Doom'd in her caterpillar's shape to lout. Her passions ill such worthless thing beseem; Pride, rage, and vanity to banish out, She creeping crawls, and drags a loathsome length about. LI How Cupid wash'd her noisome filth away; What arts he tried to win her love again; By what wiles guileful Ant'ros did assay, By leasing, still her recreant to maintain, And render Cupid's kindly labours vain: Their combat, Cupid's conquest, Psyche's crown, (My day's set task here ended) must remain Unsung; far nobler verse mote they renown: Unyoke the toiled steers, the weary sun goes down. JOVI ELEUTHERIO. Or, an Offering to LIBERTY. Quisnam igitur liber? Sapiens, sibique imperiosus; Quem neque pauperies, neque mors, neque vincula terrent: Responsare cupidinibus, contemnere honores Fortis; et in seipso totus teres atque rotundus. Hor. Serm. Lib. II. Sat. 7. Hail Liberty! whose presence glads th'abode Of heav'n itself, great attribute of God! By thee sustain'd, th'unbounded spirit runs, Moulds orbs on orbs, and lights up suns on suns; By thee sustain'd, in love unwearied lives, And uncontroul'd creates, supports, forgives: No pow'r, or time, or space his will withstood; Almighty! endless! infinite in good! “If so, why not communicate the bliss, “And let man know what this great blessing is?” Say what proportion, creature, wouldst thou claim; As thy Creator's, in extent, the same! Unless his other attributes were join'd To poise the will, and regulate the mind, Goodness to aim, and wisdom to direct, What mighty mischiefs must we thence expect? The maker knows his work; nor judg'd it fit To trust the rash resolves of human wit: Which prone to hurt, too blind to help, is still Alike pernicious, mean it good or ill. A whim, t'improvements making fond pretence, Would burst a system in experiments; Sparrows and cats indeed no more should fear, But Saturn tremble in his distant sphere: Give thee but footing in another world, Say, Archimedes, where should we be hurl'd? A sprightly wit, with liquor in his head, Would burn a globe to light him drunk to bed: Th'Ephesian temple had escap'd the flame, And heaven's high dome had built the madman's fame. The sullen might (when malice boil'd within) Strike out the stars to intimate his spleen: Not poppy-heads had spoke a Tarquin crost; Nature's chief spring had broke, and all been lost. Nor less destructive would this license prove, Tho' thy breast flam'd with universal love. In vain were thy benevolence of soul; Soon would thy folly disconcert the whole. No rains, or snows, should discompose the air; But flow'rs and sun-shine drain the weary year: No clouds should sully the clear face of day; No tempests rise,—to blow a plague away. Mercy should reign untir'd, unstain'd with blood; Spare the frail guilty,—to eat up the good: In their defence, rise, sacred Justice, rise! Awake the thunder sleeping in the skies, Sink a corrupted city in a minute: —Wo! to the righteous ten who may be in it. Pick out the bad, and sweep them all away! —So leave their babes, to cats and dogs a prey. Such pow'r without God's wisdom and his will, Were only an omnipotence of ill. Suited to man can we such pow'r esteem! Fiends would be harmless, if compar'd with him. Say then, shall all his attributes be given? His essence follows, and his throne of heav'n; His very unity. Proud wretch! shall he Un-god himself to make a god of thee? How wide, such lust of liberty confounds! Would less content thee, prudent mark the bounds! “Those which th'almighty Monarch first design'd, “When his great image seal'd the human mind; “When to the beasts the fruitful earth was giv'n; “To fish the ocean, and to birds their heaven; “And all to man: whom full creation, stor'd, “Receiv'd as its proprietor, and lord. “Ere earth, whose spacious tract unmeasur'd spreads, “Was slic'd by acres and by roods to shreds; “When trees and streams were made a general good; “And not as limits, meanly to exclude: “When all to all belong'd; ere pow'r was told “By number'd troops, or wealth by counted gold: “Ere kings, or priests, their tyranny began; “Or man was vassal'd to his fellow-man.” O halcyon state! when man begun to live! A blessing, worthy of a god to give! Who on th'unspotted mind his Maker drew The heav'nly characters, correct and true. All useful knowledge, from that source, supply'd; No blindness sprung from ignorance, or pride: All proper blessings, from that hand, bestow'd; No mischiefs, or for want, or fulness, flow'd: The quick'ning passions gave a pleasing zest; While thankful man submitted to be blest. Simplicity, was wisdom; temperance, health: Obedience, pow'r; and full contentment, wealth. So happy once was man! till the vain elf Shook off his guide, and set up for himself. Smit with the charms of independency, He scorns protection, raging to be free. Now, self-expos'd, he feels his naked state; Shrinks with the blast, or melts before the heat: And blindly wanders, as his fancy leads, To starve on wastes, or feast on pois'nous weeds. Now to the savage beasts an obvious prey; Or crafty men, more savage still than they: No less imprudent to his breast to take The friend unfaithful, or th'envenom'd snake; Equally fatal, whether on the Nile, Or in the city, weeps the crocodile. Nor yet less blindly deviates learned pride; In Ætna burn'd, or drown'd amid the tide: Boasts of superior sense; then raves to see (When contradicted) fools less wise than he. Mates with his great Creator; vainly bold To make new systems, or to mend the old. Shapes out a Deity; doubts, then denies: And drunk with science, curses God and dies. Not heav'nly wisdom, only, is with-held, But the free bounty of the self-sown field: No more, as erst, from Nature's ready feast, Rises the satisfy'd, but temp'rate guest: Cast wild abroad, no happy mean preserves; By choice he surfeits, by constraint he starves: Toils life away upon the stubborn plain, T'extort from thence the slow reluctant grain; The slow reluctant grain, procur'd to-day, His less industrious neighbour steals away: Hence fists and clubs the village-peace confound, Till sword and cannon spread the ruin round; For time and art but bring from bad to worse: Unequal lots succeed unequal force, Each lot a several curse. Hence rich, and poor: This pines, and dies neglected at the door; While gouts and fevers wait the loaded mess, And take full vengeance for the poor's distress. No more the passions are the springs of life; But seeds of vice, and elements of strife: Love, social love, t'extend to all design'd, Back to its fountain flows; to self, confin'd. Source of misfortunes; the fond husband's wrong; The maid dishonour'd, and deserted young! The mischief spreads; when vengeance for the lust Unpeoples realms, and calls the ruin just. Hence, Troy, thy fate! the blood of thousands spilt, And orphans mourning for unconscious guilt. Thus love destroys, for kinder purpose giv'n; And man corrupts the blessings meant by heav'n; Self-injur'd, let us censure Him no more: Ambition makes us slaves, and av'rice poor. What arts the wild disorder shall controul, And render peace with virtue to the soul? Out-reason interest, ballance prejudice; Give passion ears, and blinded error eyes? Arm the weak hand with conquest, and protect From guile, the heart too honest to suspect? For this, mankind, by sad experience taught, Again their safety in dependence sought: Press'd to the standard, sued before the throne; And durst rely on wisdom not their own. Hence Saturn rul'd in peace th'Ausonian plains, While Salian songs to virtue won the swains, But pois'nous streams must flow from pois'ned springs: The priests were mortal, and mere men the kings. What aid from monarchs, mighty to enslave? What good from teachers, cunning to deceive? Allegiance gives defensive arms away; And faith usurps imperial reason's sway. Let civil Rome, from faithful records, tell What royal blessings from her Nero fell. When those, prefer'd all grievance to redress, Bought of their prince a licence to oppress; When uncorupted merit found no place, But left the trade of honour to the base. See industry, by draining impost curst, Starve in the harvest, in the vintage thirst! In vain for help th'insulted matron cries, 'Twas death in husbands to have ears and eyes: Fatal were beauty, virtue, wealth, or fame: No man in aught a property could claim; No, not his sex: strange arts the monster try'd; And Sporus, spight of nature, was his bride. Unhurt by foes proud Rome for ages stands, Secure from all, but her protector's hands. Recall your pow'rs, ye Romans, back again; Unmake the monarch, and ne'er fear the man. Naked and scorn'd, see where the abject flies! And once un-cæsar'd, soon the fidler dies. Next holy Rome, thy happiness declare; While peace and truth watch round the sacred chair. Peace!—which from racks and persecution flows! Mysterious truths!—which every sense oppose! That God made man, was all th'unlearn'd could reach; That man makes God th'enlighten'd fathers teach. Men, blind and partial, need a light divine: Which popes new trim, and teach it how to shine. Rude nature dreads accusing guilt, unknown The balmy doctrine, that dead saints atone: The careful pontiff, merciful to save, Hoards up a fund of merit from the grave; And righteous hands the equal balance hold, Nor weigh it out but to just sums of gold. Sole judge, he deals his pardon, or his curse; Not heav'n itself the sentence can reverse: Grac'd with his scepter, aweful with his rod, This man of sin usurps the seat of God; Disarm'd and unador'd th'Almighty lies, And quits to saints his incense, and his skies: No more the object of our fears, or hope; The creature, and the vassal of the pope. “From fanes and cities scar'd, fly swift away!” —To the rude Lybian in his wilds a prey. “The blood-stain'd sword from the fell tyrant wrest!” —Thousands unsheath'd shall threat thy naked breast. “The dogmatists imperious aid disdain!” —So sink in brutish ignorance again. “Is there no medium? must we victims fall “To one man's Lust, or to the Rage of all? “Is reason doom'd a certain slave to be, “To our blind Passions, or a priest's Decree?” Hail happy Albion! whose distinguish'd plains This temp'rate mean, so dearly earn'd, maintains! Senates, (the will of individuals check'd) The strength and prudence of the realm collect, Each yields to all; that each may thence receive The full assistance, which the whole can give. For this, thy patriots lawless pow'r withstood, And bought their children's charter with their blood; While reverend years, and various letter'd age, Dispassion'd open the mysterious page; Not one alone the various judgment sways, But prejudice the general voice obeys: For this, thy martyrs wak'd the bloody strife, Asserting truth with brave contempt of life. Oh Oxford! let deliver'd Briton know From thy fam'd seats her several blessings flow. Th'accouter'd barons, and assisting knights, In thee prepar'd for council, or for fights, Plan'd and obtain'd her By the Oxford provisions, A. D. 1258; at which time the commons are supposed first to have obtained the privilege of representatives in parliament. civil liberty: Truth found her fearless In the imprisonment, disputes, and sufferings of our first reformers, Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, at Oxford, A.D. 1554–6. witnesses in thee; When, try'd as gold, saints, from thy tott'ring pyres, Rose up to heav'n, Elijah-like, in fires! Peace to thy walls! and honour to thy name! May age to age record thy gathering fame! While thy still favour'd seats pour forth their youth, Brave advocates of liberty and truth! In fair succession rise to bless the realm! Fathers in church, and statesmen at the helm! “But factious synods thro' resentment err; “And venal senates private good prefer: “How wild the faith which wrangling sophs dispose! “The laws how harsh of pension'd aye's and no's!” Wilt thou by no authority be aw'd, Self-excommunicated, self-outlaw'd? Expunge the creed, the decalogue reject? If they oblige not, nor will they protect. You fear no God;—convinc'd by what you say, Knaves praise your wit, and swear your lands away. Corrupt not wives, erase it if you will; The injur'd husband blots out,—do not kill. From God his sabbaths steal, for sport, not need; Why hangs the wretch, who steals thy purse for bread? Or shall each schismatic your faith new mould, Or senates stand by patriot mobs controul'd? Drive back, ye floods! roll, Xanthus, to your spring! Go, crown the people, and subject the king; Break rule to pieces, analyse its pow'r, And every atom to its lord restore: As mixt with knaves, or fools, the weak, or brave, A dupe, a plague, a tyrant, or a slave. “What shall I do; how hit the happy mean “'Twixt blind submission, and unruly spleen?” Consult your watch; you guide your actions by't; And great its use, tho' not for ever right. What tho' some think implicit faith be due, And dine at twelve if their town-clock strike two? Or others bravely squir their watch away, Disdain a guide, and guess the time of day? They guess so lucky, or their parts so great, They come on all affairs, but just too late; You neither choose. Nor trav'ling thro' the street, Correct its hand by ev'ry one you meet; Yet scruple not, if you should find at one It points to six, to set it by the Sun. Aim at the bliss that's suited to thy state, Nor vainly hope for happiness compleat; Some bounds imperfect natures must include, And vice and weakness feel defects of good. Nor is it blind necessity alone: Contriving wisdom, in the whole, we own: And in that wisdom satisfy'd may trust, In its restraints, as merciful, as just. By these thy selfish passions it corrects; By these from wrong thy weakness it protects; In sovereign power thy safety's heaven's design; Some faults permitted, as the scourge of thine, Absurd the wish of all men, if exprest; Each grieves that he's not lord of all the rest. Why then should we complain, or thankless live, Because not blest with more than God can give? Would you be safe from others? 'tis but due, That others also should be safe from you. It is not virtue wakes the clam'rous throng; Each claims th'exclusive privilege, to wrong. When ceaseless faction must embroil the mad; Alike impatient, under A' or Zad. How patriot Cromwell fights for liberty! He shifts the yoke, then calls the nation free. He cannot bear a monarch on the throne; But vindicates his right—to rule alone. Macheath roars out for freedom in his cell; And Tindal wisely would extinguish hell. Macheath's approv'd by all whom Tyburn awes, And trembling guilt gives Tindal's page applause. O sage device, to set the conscience free From dread! he winks; then says that heav'n can't see. Both blindly plan the paradise of fools; Peace without laws, and virtue without rules. Full of the Roman let the school-boy quote, And rant all Lucian's rhapsodies by rote. Gods! shall he tremble at a mortal's nod! His generous soul disdains the tyrant's rod. Forc'd to submit, at last he tastes the fruit; Finds wealth and honours blossom from its root. Would thy young soul be like the Roman free? From Romans paint thy form of Liberty: The goddess offers gifts from either hand; In this manner they represent Liberty on their medals.Th'auspicious bonnet, with the Prætor's wand; The privilege of that would'st thou not miss, Bend, and submit beneath the stroke of this. See Furioso on his keeper frown, Depriv'd the precious privilege to drown; Greatly he claims a right to his undoing; The chains that hold him, hold him from his ruin. Kindly proceed; strict discipline dispense; Till water-gruel low'rs him down to sense. “Why this to me? am I the froward boy, “Or knave to wrong, or madman to destroy?” Will thy denial prove that thou art none! 'Tis Newgate's logick: thou art all in one. Blind to their good, to be instructed loth, Dryden in All for Love.Men are but children of a larger growth; If no superior force the will controul, Self-love's a villain, and corrupts the soul; Wild and destructive projects fire our brains; We all are madmen, and demand our chains. Know your own sphere, content to be a man; Well pleas'd, to be as happy as you can: Lose not all good, by shunning ills in vain; 'Tis wiser to enjoy than to complain. Some evils must attend imperfect states; But discontent new worlds of ills creates. Hush thy complaints, nor quarrel with thy God; If just the stroke, approve and kiss the rod. By man if injur'd, turn thy eyes within; Thou'lt find recorded some unpunish'd sin; Then heav'n acquit: and with regard to man, Coolly th'amount of good and evil scan; If greater evils wait the wish'd redress, Grieve not that thou art free to chuse the less. Unknown to courts, ambition's thirst subdu'd, My lesson is to be obscurely good; In life's still shade, which no man's envy draws, Legum idcirco servi sumus, ut liberi esse possimus.

AN EPISTLE FROM A Swiss Officer to his Friend at Rome. From horrid mountains ever hid in snow, And barren lands, and dreary plains below; To you, dear sir, my best regards I send, The weakest reasoner, as the truest friend. Your arguments, that vainly strive to please, Your arts, your country, and your palaces; What signs of Roman grandeur still remain— Much you have said; and much have said in vain. Fine pageants these for slaves, to please the eye; And put the neatest dress on misery! Bred up to slav'ry and dissembled pain, Unhappy man! you trifle with your chain: But should your friend with your desires comply, And sell himself to Rome and slav'ry; He could not wear his trammels with that art, Or hide the noble anguish of his heart: You'd soon repent the livery that you gave; For, trust me, I should make an aukward slave. Falsely you blame our barren rocks and plains, Happy in freedom and laborious swains; Our peasants chearful to the field repair, And can enjoy the labours of the year; Whilst yours, beneath some tree, with mournful eyes, Sees for his haughty lord his harvests rise: Then silent sighs; but stops his slavish breath: He silent sighs: for should he speak, 'tis death. Hence from our field the lazy grain we call, Too much for want, for luxury too small: Whilst all Campania's rich inviting soil Scarce knows the plowshare, or the reaper's toil. In arms we breed our youth. To dart from far, And aim aright the thunder of the war; To whirl the faulchion, and direct the blow; To ward the stroke, or bear upon the foe. Early in hardships through the woods they fly, Nor feel the piercing frost, or wintry sky; Some prowling wolf or foamy boar to meet, And stretch the panting savage at their feet: Inur'd by this, they seek a nobler war, And show an honest pride in ev'ry scar; With joy the danger and the blood partake, Whilst ev'ry wound is for their country's sake. But you, soft warriors, forc'd into the field, Or faintly strike, or impotently yield; For well this universal truth you know, Who fights for tyrants is his country's foe. I envy not your arts, the Roman schools, Improv'd, perhaps, but to inslave your souls. May you to stone, or nerves or beauty give, And teach the soft'ning marble how to live; May you the passions in your colours trace, And work up every piece with every grace; In airs and attitudes be wondrous wise, And know the arts to please, or to surprize; In musick's softest sound consume the day, Sounds that would melt the warrior's soul away: Vain efforts these, an honest fame to raise; Your painters, and your eunuchs, be your praise: Grant us more real goods, you heav'nly powers! Virtue, and arms, and liberty be ours. Weak are your offers to the free and brave; No bribe can purchase me to be a slave. Hear me, ye rocks, ye mountains, and ye plains, The happy bounds of our Helvetian swains! In thee, my country, will I fix my seat; Nor envy the poor wretch, that would be great: My life and arms I dedicate to thee;— For, know, it is my int'rest to be free. LIFE burthensome, because we know not how to use it. An EPISTLE. What, sir, a month, and not one line afford? 'Tis well:—how finely some folk keep their word! I own my promise.—But to steal an hour, 'Midst all this hurry—'tis not in my pow'r, Where life each day does one fix'd order keep, Successive journies, weariness and sleep. Or if our scheme some interval allows, Some hours design'd for thought and for repose; Soon as the scatter'd images begin In the mind to rally—company comes in: Reason, adieu! there's no more room to think; For all the day behind is noise and drink. Thus life rolls on, but not without regret; Whene'er at morning, in some cool retreat, I walk alone:—'tis then in thought I view Some sage of old; 'tis then I think of you: Whose breast no tyrant passions ever seize, No pulse that riots, blood that disobeys; Who follow but where judgment points the way, And whom too busy sense ne'er led astray. Not that you joys with moderation shun, You taste all pleasures, but indulge in none. Fir'd by this image, I resolve anew: 'Tis reason calls, and peace and joy's in view. How bless'd a change! a long adieu to sense: O shield me, sapience! virtue's reign commence! Alas, how short a reign?—the walk is o'er, The dinner waits, and friends some half a score: At first to virtue firm, the glass I fly; 'Till some sly sot,—“Not drink the family!” Thus gratitude is made to plead for sin; My trait'rous breast a party forms within: And inclination brib'd, we never want Excuse—“'Tis hot, and walking makes one faint.” Now sense gets strength; my bright resolves decay, Like stars that melt at the approach of day: Thought dies, and ev'n, at last, your image fades away. My head grows warm; all reason I despise: “To-day be happy, and to-morrow wise!” Betray'd so oft, I'm half persuaded now, Surely to fail, the first step is to vow. The country lately, 'twas my wish: oh there! Gardens, diversions, friends, relations, air: For London now, dear London, how I burn! I must be happy, sure, when I return. Whoever hopes true happiness to see, Hopes for what never was, nor e'er will be: The nearest ease, since we must suffer still, Are they, who dare be patient under ill. Whilom a fool saw where a fiddle lay; And after pouring round it, strove to play: Above, below, across, all ways he tries; He tries in vain, 'tis discord all and noise: Fretting he threw it by: then thus the lout; “There's musick in it, could I fetch it out.” If life does not its harmony impart, We want not instruments, but have not art. 'Tis endless to defer our hopes of ease, Till crosses end, and disappointments cease. The sage is happy, not that all goes right, His cattle feel no rot, his corn no blight; The mind for ease is fitted to the wise, Not so the fool's;—'tis here the difference lies: Their prospect is the same, but various are their eyes. The Duty of Employing one's Self. An EPISTLE. Few people know it, yet, dear sir, 'tis true, Man should have somewhat evermore to do. Hard labour's tedious, every one must own; But surely better such by far, than none; The perfect drone, the quite impertinent, Whose life at nothing aims, but—to be spent; Such heaven visits for some mighty ill: 'Tis sure the hardest labour, to sit still. Hence that unhappy tribe who nought pursue: Who sin, for want of something else to do. Sir John is bless'd with riches, honour, love And to be bless'd indeed, needs only move. For want of this, with pain he lives away, A lump of hardly-animated clay: Dull till his double bottle does him right: He's easy just at twelve o'clock at night. Thus for one sparkling hour alone he's blest; While spleen and head-ach seize on all the rest. What numbers, sloth with gloomy humours fills! Racking their brains with visionary ills. Hence what loud outcries, and well-meaning rage, What endless quarrels at the present age! How many blame! how often may we hear, “Such vice!—well, sure, the last day must be near!” T'avoid such wild, imaginary pains, The sad creation of distemper'd brains, Dispatch, dear friend! move, labour, sweat, run, fly! Do aught—but think the day of judgment nigh. There are, who've lost all relish for delight: With them no earthly thing is ever right. T'expect to alter to their taste, were vain; For who can mend so fast, as they complain? Whate'er you do, shall be a crime with such; One while you've lost your tongue, then talk too much: Thus shall you meet their waspish censure still; As hedge-hogs prick you, go which side you will. Oh! pity these whene'er you see them swell! Folks call 'em cross—poor men! they are not well. How many such, in indolence grown old, With vigour ne'er do any thing, but scold? Who spirits only from ill-humour get; Like wines that die, unless upon the fret. Weary'd of flouncing to himself alone, Acerbus keeps a man to fret upon. The fellow's nothing in the earth to do, But to sit quit and be scolded to. Pishes and oaths, whene'er the master's sour'd, All largely on the scape-goat slave are pour'd. This drains his rage; and tho' to John so rough, Abroad you'd think him complaisant enough. As for myself, whom poverty prevents From being angry at so great expence; Who, should I ever be inclin'd to rage, For want of slaves, war with myself must wage; Must rail, and hear; chastising, be chastis'd: Be both the tyrant, and the tyranniz'd; I chuse to labour, rather than to fret: What's rage in some, in me goes off in sweat. If times are ill, and things seem never worse; Men, manners to reclaim,—I take my horse. One mile reforms 'em, or if aught remain Unpurg'd,—'tis but to ride as far again. Thus on myself in toils I spend my rage: I pay the fine; and that absolves the age. Sometimes, still more to interrupt my ease, I take my pen, and write—such things as these: Which tho' all other merit be deny'd, Shew my devotion still to be employ'd. Add too, tho' writing be itself a curse, Yet some distempers are a curse for worse: And since 'midst indolence, spleen will prevail, Since who do nothing else, are sure to rail; Man should be suffer'd thus to play the fool, To keep from hurt, as children go to school. You should not rhyme in spite of nature?—True; Yet sure 'tis greater trouble, if you do; And if 'tis lab'ring only, men profess, Who writes the hardest, writes with most success. Thus for myself, and friends, I do my part; Promoting doubly the pains-taking art: First to myself, 'tis labour to compose; To read such lines, is drudgery to those. On SCRIBLING against GENIUS. An EPISTLE. No single rule's more frequently enjoin'd, Than this; “Observe the byass of your mind.” However just by ev'ry one confess'd, There's not a rule more frequently transgress'd, For mortals, to their int'rest blind, pursue The thing they like, not that they're fit to do. This Verro's fault, by frequent praises fir'd, He several parts had try'd, in each admir'd. That Verro was not ev'ry way compleat, 'Twas long unknown, and might have been so yet: But musick-mad, th'unhappy man pursu'd That only thing heav'n meant he never shou'd; And thus his proper road to fame neglected, He's ridicul'd for that he but affected. Wou'd men but act from nature's secret call, Or only, where that fails, not act at all: If not their skill, they'd shew at least good sense,— They'd get no fame—nor wou'd they give offence. Not that where some one merit is deny'd, Men must be ev'ry way unqualify'd; Nor hold we, like that wrong-concluding wight, A man can't fish—because he cou'd not write. View all the world around: each man design'd And furnish'd for some fav'rite part you find. That, sometimes low: yet this, so small a gift, Proves nature did not turn him quite adrift. The phlegmatick, dull, aukward, thick, gross-witted, Have all some clumsy work for which they're fitted. 'Twas never known, in men a perfect void, Ev'n I and T?ld might be well employ'd; Wou'd we our poverty of parts survey, And follow as our genius led the way. What then? obedient to that turn of mind Shou'd men jog on to one dull path confin'd; From that small circle never dare depart, To strike at large, and snatch a grace from art? At least with care forbidden paths pursue? Who quits the road, should keep it still in view: From genius some few 'scapes may be allow'd; But ever keep within its neighbourhood. But C?r, faithless to his byass see, With giant-sin opposing heav'n's decree. Still fond where he shou'd not, he blunders on With all that haste fools make to be undone: Want of success his passion but augments; Like eunuchs rage of love, from impotence. 'Mongst all the instances of genius crost, The rhyming tribe are those who err the most. Each piddling wretch who hath but common sense, Or thinks he hath, to verse shall make pretence: Why not? 'tis their diversion, and 'twere hard If men of their estates shou'd be debarr'd. Thus wealth with them gives every thing beside; As people worth so much are qualify'd: They've all the requisites for writing fit, All but that one—some little share of wit. Give way, ye friends, nor with fond pray'rs proceed To stop the progress of a pen full speed. 'Tis heav'n, incens'd by some prodigious crime, Thus for men's sins determines them to rhyme. Bad men, no doubt; perhaps 'tis vengeance due For shrines they've plunder'd, or some wretch they slew. Whate'er it be, sure grievous is th'offence, And grievous is (heaven knows!) its recompence. At once in want of rhyme, and want of rest; Plagues to themselves, and to mankind a jest: Seduc'd by empty forms of false delight— Such, in some men, their deadly lust to write! Ev'n I, whose genius seems as much forgot, (Mine when I write, as your's when you do not;) Who gravely thus can others' faults condemn, My self allowing, what I blame in them; With no pretence to Phœbus' aid divine, Nor the least int'rest in the tuneful Nine, With all the guilt of impotence in view, Griev'd for past sins, but yet committing new; Whate'er the wits may say, or wise may think, Am fooling ev'ry way with pen and ink. When all who wish me best, begin t'advise, ‘That being witty, is not being wise; ‘That if the voice of int'rest might be heard, ‘For one who wears a gown,—wou'd be prefer'd— Incorrigibly deaf, I feign a yawn; And mock their just conclusions, ere they're drawn. If to my practice, they oppos'd my theme; And pointed, how I swam against the stream: With all the rancour of a bard in rage, I'd quote 'em half the writers of the age; Who in a wrath of verse, with all their might Write on, howe'er unqualify'd to write, The MIMICK. By the Rev. Mr. Pitt. The Mimick's ductile features claim my lays, Chang'd to a thousand shapes, a thousand ways: Who with variety of arts puts on All other persons, and throws off his own; Whose looks well disciplin'd his will obey, Bloom at command, or at command decay: Nor blush, my Muse, those changes to impart, Which ask an Ovid's or Apollo's art. But who, Apollo, all the arts can trace, All the deceits of that delusive face? For lo! in sight the various artist comes; Lo! how in beauty and in health he blooms: Its smoothest charms triumphant youth supplies, Laughs in his cheeks, and sparkles in his eyes. But sudden see, the scene is snatch'd away, See each inverted feature in decay; His muscles all relax'd, his face o'ergrown, Rough and emboss'd with wrinkles not his own. He trails his dangling legs: the wond'ring train Laugh at the solemn conduct of his cane; Rapt thro' the scenes of life, he drops his prime; A cripple sixty years before his time; Runs in a moment all his stages o'er, And steps from four-and-twenty to fourscore. Now he a venerable judge appears, And the long garb of lazy purple wears; Like drowsy P?'s looks his aged frame, His mien, his habit, and address the same: When to the sneering crowd he lisps a joke, Puns from the law, or quibbles out of Coke; With settled air, and most judicious face, Nods o'er the cushion, counsel, and the case; Slumbers, and hears by starts the noisy train; Catches a period, and drops down again. And now his hearers in their turn to lull, Himself stands up most venerably dull; Talks of old times; commends their loyal zeal, Their wholsome statutes, discipline, and ale; On different themes bestows one common praise, The Thames, the streets, the king, and king's highways. You see him quit the bench, and strait appear An huge old gouty counsel at the bar; Bawl for his client, wrest the tortur'd laws From their true sense, and mould them to the cause; In solemn form harangue the list'ning crowd, And hem and cough emphatically loud; Blest art indeed! and glorious eloquence, Where empty noise supplies the want of sense. For meaning, signs, and motions he affords, And interjections for the want of words. What shape to you, O S?'s, is unknown! What face, but you adopt into your own! At the least hint, fictitious crowds you raise, And multiply yourself ten thousand ways: This moment, to indulge the mirthful vein, A fool's or doctor's person you sustain; The next resume yourself and sense again. Am I deceiv'd? or by some sudden slight, A starch'd tub-preacher now he strikes the sight, (Quick the transition, and unseen the art!) Pale and entirely chang'd in ev'ry part, His short'ned visage, and fantastick dress, The mad fantastick to the life express; That small silk cap; those puritanick hairs, Crop'd to the quick, and circling round his ears; That rounded face the Mimick here proclaim, How very different, yet how still the same! Now he, by just degrees, his silence breaks; His frantick silence mutt'ring ere he speaks: Protracted hums the solemn farce begin, And groans and pauses interrupt the scene; As each in just succession comes and goes, Work'd to its pitch, the spirit stronger grows, And squeezes out his eyes, and twangs his vocal nose. Now quick and rapid, and in rage more loud, A storm of nonsense bursts upon the crowd: His hand and voice proclaim the gen'ral doom, While this the hour-glass shakes, and that the room. On nature's ruins all his doctrines dwell, And throw wide open every gate of hell. A thousand other shapes he wears with grace; A thousand more varieties of face: But who, in every shape, can count him o'er, Who multiplies his person every hour? What Muse his flying features can pursue, Or keep his wand'ring countenance in view? Had I a thousand mouths, a thousand tongues, A throat of brass, and adamantine lungs, I could not celebrate this Proteus' skill, Who shifts his person and his face at will; This Proteus, who out-numbers hosts alone; A crowd himself; a multitude in one. An EPISTLE from FLORENCE. To T. A. Esq; Tutor to the Earl of P?. Written in the Year 1740. By the Honourable ?. When flourish'd with their state th'Athenian name, And Learning and Politeness were the same, Philosophy with gentle art refin'd The honest roughness of th'unpractis'd mind: She call'd the latent beams of Nature forth, Guided their ardour, and insur'd their worth. She pois'd th'impetuous Warrior's vengeful steel, Mark'd true Ambition from destructive Zeal, Pointed what lustre on that laurel blows, Which Virtue only on her sons bestows. Hence clement Cimon of unspotted fame, Hence Aristides' ever fav'rite name; Heroes, who knew to wield the righteous spear, And guard their native tow'rs from foreign fear; Or in firm bands of social Peace to bind Their Country's good, and benefit mankind. She trim'd the thoughtful Statesman's nightly oil, Confirm'd his mind beneath an empire's toil, Or with him to his silent villa stole, Gilded his ev'ning hours, and harmoniz'd his soul. To woods and caves she never bade retreat, Nor fix'd in cloyster'd monkeries her seat: No lonely precepts to her sons enjoin'd, Nor taught them to be men, to shun mankind. Cynics there were, an uncouth selfish race, Of manners foul, and boastful of disgrace: Brutes, whom no Muse has ever lov'd to name, Whose Ignominy is their only fame, No hostile Trophies grace their honour'd urn, Around their tomb no sculptur'd Virtues mourn; Nor tells the marble into emblems grav'd, An Art discover'd, or a City sav'd. Be this the goal to which the Briton-Peer Exalt his hope, and press his young career! Be this the goal to which, my Friend, may you With gentle skill direct his early view! Artful the various studies to dispense, And melt the schoolman's jargon down to sense. See the pedantick Teacher, winking dull, The letter'd Tyrant of a trembling school; Teaching by force, and proving by a frown, His lifted fasces ram the lesson down. From tortur'd strains of eloquence he draws Barbarick precepts and unmeaning laws, By his own sense wou'd Tully's word expound, And a new Vandal tramples classick ground. Perhaps a Bigot to the learned page, No modern custom can his thoughts engage; His little farm by Georgick rules he ploughs, And prunes by metre the luxuriant boughs, Still from Aratus' sphere or Maro's signs, The future calm or tempest he divines, And fears if the prognostick Raven's found Et sola in sicca secum spatiatur arena. Virg.Expatiating alone along the dreary round. What scanty precepts! studies how confin'd! Too mean to fill your comprehensive mind: Unsatisfy'd with knowing when or where Some Roman Bigot rais'd a Fane to Fear; On what green medal Virtue stands express'd, How Concord's pictur'd, Liberty how dress'd; Or with wise Ken judiciously define, When Pius marks the honorary coin Of Caracalla, or of Antonine. Thirsting for knowledge, but to know the right, Thro' judgment's optick guide th'illusive sight, To let in rays on Reason's darkling cell, And Prejudice's lagging mists dispel; For this you turn the Greek and Roman page, Weigh the contemplative and active Sage, And cull some useful flow'r from each heroick Age. Thence teach the Youth the necessary art, To know the Judge's from the Critick's part; Show how ignoble is the passion, Fear, And place some patriot Roman's model near; Their bright examples to his soul instil, Who knew no Fear, but that of doing ill. Tell him, 'tis all a cant, a trifle all, To know the folds that from the Toga fall, The Clavus' breadth, the Bulla's golden round, And ev'ry leaf that ev'ry Virtue crown'd; But shew how brighter in each honest breast Than in her shrine, the Goddess stood confess'd. Tell him, it is not the fantastick Boy, Elate with pow'r and swell'd with frantick joy, 'Tis not a slavish Senate, fawning, base, Can stamp with honest fame a worthless race; Tho' the false Coin proclaim him great and wise, The tyrant's life shall tell that Coin, it lies. But when your early Care shall have design'd To plan the Soul and mould the waxen Mind; When you shall pour upon his tender Breast Ideas that must stand an Age's test, Oh! there imprint with strongest deepest dye The lovely form of Goddess Liberty! For her in Senates be he train'd to plead, For her in Battles be he taught to bleed. Lead him where Dover's rugged cliff resounds With dashing seas, fair Freedom's honest bounds, Point to yon azure Carr bedropp'd with gold, Whose weight the necks of Gallia's sons uphold; Where proudly sits an iron-scepter'd Queen, And fondly triumphs o'er the prostrate scene, Cry, That is Empire! shun her baleful path, Her Words are Slavery, and her Touch is Death! Thro' wounds and blood the Fury drives her way, And murthers half, to make the rest her prey. Thus spoke each Spartan matron, as she dress'd With the bright cuirass the young soldier's breast; On the new warrior's tender-sinew'd thigh, Girt Fear of Shame and Love of Liberty. Steel'd with such precepts, for a cause so good, What scanty bands the Persian host withstood! Before the sons of Greece let Asia tell How fled her Xerxes. Monarch, how her Millions fell! When arm'd for Liberty, a Few how brave! How weak a Multitude, where each a Slave! No welcome Faulchion fill'd their fainting hand, No Voice inspir'd of favourite Command: No Peasant fought for wealthy lands possess'd, No fond remembrance warm'd the Parent's breast: They saw their lands for royal riot groan, And toil in vain for banquets, not their own; They saw their infant Race to bondage rise, And frequent heard the ravish'd Virgin's cries, Dishonour'd but to cool a transient gust Of some luxurious Satrap's barb'rous lust. The greatest curses any Age has known, Have issued from the Temple or the Throne; Extent of ill from Kings at first begins, But Priests must aid, and consecrate their sins. The tortur'd Subject might be heard complain, When sinking under a new weight of chain, Or more rebellious might perhaps repine, When tax'd to dow'r a titled Concubine, But the Priest christens all a Right Divine. When at the altar a new Monarch kneels, What conjur'd awe upon the people steals! The chosen He adores the precious oil, Meekly receives the solemn charm, and while The Priest some blessed nothings mutters o'er, Sucks in the sacred grease at ev'ry pore: He seems at once to shed his mortal skin, And feels Divinity transfus'd within. The trembling Vulgar dread the royal Nod, And worship God's anointed more than God. Such Sanction gives the Prelate to such Kings! So Mischief from those hallow'd fountains springs. But bend your eye to yonder harrass'd plains, Where King and Priest in one united reigns; See fair Italia mourn her holy state, And droop oppress'd beneath a papal weight: Where fat Celibacy usurps the soil, And sacred Sloth consumes the peasant's toil: The holy Drones monopolize the sky, And plunder by a vow of Poverty. The Christian Cause their lewd profession taints, Unlearn'd, unchaste, uncharitable Saints. Oppression takes Religion's hallow'd name, And Priest-craft knows to play the specious game. Behold how each enthusiastic fool Of ductile piety, becomes their tool: Observe with how much art, what fine pretence, They hallow Foppery and combat Sense. Some hoary Hypocrite, grown old in sin, Whose thoughts of heav'n with his last hours begin, Counting a chaplet with a bigot care, And mumbling somewhat 'twixt a charm and pray'r, Hugs and dawb'd image of his injur'd Lord, And squeezes out on the dull idol-board A sore-ey'd gum of tears; the flannel Crew With cunning joy the fond repentance view, Pronounce Him bless'd, his miracles proclaim, Teach the slight crow'd t'adore his hallow'd name, Exalt his praise above the Saints of old, And coin his sinking conscience into Gold. Or when some Pontiff with imperious hand Sends forth his edict to excise the land, The tortur'd Hind unwillingly obeys, And mutters curses as his mite he pays! The subtle Priest th'invidious name forbears, Asks it for holy use or venal pray'rs; Exhibits all their trumpery to sale, A bone, a mouldy morsel, or a nail: Th'indolatrous Devout adore the show, And in full streams the molten off'rings flow. No pagan object, nothing too profane, To aid the Romish zeal for Christian gain. Each Temple with new weight of idols nods, And borrow'd Altars smoke to other Gods. Prometheus' Vultur Matthew's Eagle proves; And heav'nly Cherubs sprout from heathen Loves; Young Ganymede a winged Angel stands By holy Luke, and dictates God's commands: St. Apollos. Apollo, tho' degraded, still can bless, Rewarded with a Sainthood, and an S. Each convert Godhead is apostoliz'd, And Jove himself by At St. Peter's an old statue of Jupiter is turned into a St. Peter. Peter's name baptiz'd. Astarte shines in Jewish Mary's fame, Still Queen of heav'n, another and the same. While the proud Priest the sacred Tyrant reigns Of empty cities and dispeopled plains, Where fetter'd Nature is forbid to rove In the free commerce of productive Love: Behold imprison'd with her barren kind, In gloomy cells the votive Maid confin'd; Faint streams of blood, by long stagnation weak; Scarce tinge the fading damask of her cheek; In vain she pines, the holy Faith withstands, What Nature dictates and what God commands: But if some sanguine He, some lusty Priest Of jollier morals taste the tempting feast, From the strong grasp if some poor babe arise, Unwelcome, unindear'd, it instant dies; Or poisons blasting soon the hasty joy, Th'imperfect seeds of infant life destroy. Fair Modesty, thou virgin tender-ey'd, From thee the Muse the grosser acts must hide, Nor the dark cloister's mystick rites display, Whence num'rous brawny Monkhoods waste away, And unprolifick, tho' forsworn, decay. Britannia smiling, views her golding plains From mitred bondage free and papal chains; Her jocund Sons pass each unburthen'd day Securely quiet, innocently gay: Lords of themselves the happy Rusticks sing, Each of his little tenement the King. Twice did usurping Rome extend her hand, To reinslave the new-deliver'd land; Twice were her sable bands to battle warm'd, With pardons, bulls, and texts, and murthers arm'd; Addit &amp; Herculeos Arcus Hastamque Minervæ, Quicquid habent telorum armamentaria Cœli. Juv.With Peter's sword and Michael's lance were sent, And whate'er stores supply'd the Church's armament. Twice did the gallant Albion race repell The Jesuit legions to the gates of hell; Or whate'er Angel, friend to Britain, took Or William's or Eliza's guardian look. Arise, young Peer! shine forth in such a cause! Who draws the sword for Freedom, justly draws. Reflect how dearly was that Freedom bought; For that, how oft your ancestors have fought; Thro' the long series of our princes down, How wrench'd some right from each too potent Crown. See abject John, that vassal-Monarch, see! Bow down the royal neck, and crouch the supple knee! Oh! prostitution of imperial State! To a vile Romish Priest's vile The Pope's Nuncio. Delegate. Him the bold Barons scorning to obey, And be the subjects of a subject sway; Heroes whose names to latest fame shall shine, Aw'd by no visions of a Right Divine, That bond by eastern Politicians wrought, Which ours have learnt, and Rabbi Doctors taught, To straiter banks restrain'd the Royal Will, That great prerogative of doing ill. To late example and experience dead, See Henry III. Henry in his Father's footsteps tread. Too young to govern, immature to pow'r, His early follies haunt his latest hour. His nobles injur'd, and his realms oppress'd, No violated Senate's wrongs redress'd, His hoary age sinks in the feeble wane Of an inglorious, slighted, tedious reign. The Muse too long with idle glories fed, And train'd to trumpet o'er the warlike dead, The wanton fain on giddy plumes would soar, To Gallic Loire and Jordan's humbled shore; Again would teach the Saracen and Gaul, At Edward I. and II. Edward's and at Henry V. Henry's name to fall; Romantick heroes! prodigal of blood; What numbers stain'd each ill-disputed flood! Tools to a Clergy! warring but to feast With spoils of provinces each pamper'd Priest. Be dumb, fond Maid; thy sacred ink nor spill On specious Tyrants, popularly ill; Nor be thy comely locks with Roses dight Of either victor colour, Red or White. Foil'd the assassin Richard III. King, in union blow The blended flow'rs on seventh Henry's brow. Peace lights again on the forsaken strand, And banish'd Plenty re-assumes the land. No nodding crest the crouching infant frights, No clarion rudely breaks the bride's delights; Reposing sabres seek their ancient place To bristle round a gaping Medusa's head in the armory at the Tower. Gorgon's face. The wearied arms grotesquely deck the wall, And tatter'd trophies fret the Royal Westminster-Hall. hall. But Peace in vain on the blood-fatten'd plains From her exuberant horn her treasures rains: She deals her gifts; but in an useless hour, To glut the iron hand of griping Pow'r: Such Lancaster, whom harrass'd Britain saw, Mask'd in the garb of antiquated Law: More politick than wise, more wise than great: A legislator to enslave the state; Coolly malicious; by design a knave; More mean than false, ambitious more than brave; Attach'd to Interest's more than Honour's call; More strict than just, more covetous than all. Not so the Reveller profuse, his Henry VIII. Son, His contrast course of tyranny begun; Robust of limb, and flush'd with florid grace, Strength nerv'd his youth, and squar'd his jovial face. To feats of arms and carpet-combats prone, In either field the vig'rous monarch shone: Mark'd out for riot each luxurious day In tournaments and banquets danc'd away. But shift the scene, and view what slaughters stain Each frantick period of his barb'rous reign: A Tyrant to the people whom he rul'd, By ev'y potentate he dealt with, fool'd: Sold by one Cardinal Woolsey, minister, to all unjust; Sway'd by each dictate of distemper'd lust; Changing each worship that controul'd the bent Of his adult'rous will, and lewd intent; Big in unwieldy majesty and pride, And smear'd with Queens and Martyrs blood, He dy'd. Pass we the pious Edward VI. Youth too slightly seen; The murd'rous zeal of a weak Romish Mary. Queen: Nor with faint pencil, impotently vain, Shadow the glories of Eliza's reign, Who's still too great, tho' some few faults she had, To catalogue with all those Royal bad. Arise, great James! thy course of wisdom run! Image of David's philosophick Son! He comes! on either hand in seemly state, Knowledge and Peace, his fondled handmaids wait: Obscurely learn'd, elaborately dull, Of quibbling cant and grace fanatick full, Thron'd in full senate, on his pedant tongue, These for six hours each weighty morning hung; For these each string of royal pow'r he strain'd, For these he sold whate'er Eliza gain'd; For these he squander'd ev'ry prudent store The frugal Princess had reserv'd before, On pension'd sycophants and garter'd boys, Tools of his will, and minions of his joys. For these he let his beggar'd Queen of Bohemia. daughter roam; Bubbled, for these, by Spanish art at home; For these, to sum the blessings of his reign, Poison'd one Son Prince Henry, and Charles I. and t'other sent to Spain. Retire, strict Muse, and thy impartial verse In pity spare on Charles's bleeding herse; Or all his faults in blackest notes translate To tombs where rot the authors of his fate; To lustful Henrietta's Romish shade, Let all his acts of lawless pow'r be laid; Or to the Archbishop Laud. Priest, more Romish still than her; And whoe'er made his gentle virtues err. On the next Charles II. Prince, expell'd his native land, In vain Affliction laid her iron hand; Fortune, or fair or frowning, on his soul Cou'd stamp no virtue, and no vice controul: Honour, or morals, gratitude, or truth, Nor learn'd his ripen'd age, nor knew his youth; The care of Nations left to whores or chance, Plund'rer of Britain, pensioner of France; Free to buffoons, to ministers deny'd, He liv'd an atheist, and a bigot dy'd. The reins of Empire, or resign'd or stole, Are trusted next to James's weak controul; Him, meditating to subvert the laws, His Hero William III. Son in Freedom's beauteous cause Rose to chastise: Infelix utcumque ferent ea facta minores! Virg. unhappy still! howe'er Posterity the gallant action bear.

Volentes Per populos dat jura viamque affectat Olympo. Virg. willing Indians deals our equal laws, And from his Country's voice affects applause; Illo Virgilium me tempore dulcis alebat Parthenope, studiis florentem ignobilis otî. Virg.What time fair Florence on her peaceful shore, Free from the din of war and battle's roar, Has lap'd me trifler in inglorious ease, Modelling precepts that may serve and please; Yours is the task—and glorious is the plan, To build the Free, the Sensible, Good Man. The BEAUTIES. An Epistle to Mr. Eckardt the Painter. Desponding artist, talk no more Of Beauties of the days of yore, Of Goddesses renown'd in Greece, And Zeuxis' composition-piece, Where every nymph that could at most Some single grace or feature boast, Contributed her favourite charm To perfect the ideal form. 'Twas Cynthia's brow, 'twas Lesbia's eye, 'Twas Cloe's cheeks' vermilion dye; Roxana lent the noble air, Dishevell'd flow'd Aspasia's hair, And Cupid much too fondly press'd His mimick mother Thais' breast. Antiquity, how poor thy use! A single Venus to produce! Friend Eckardt, ancient story quit, Nor mind whatever Pliny writ; Felibien and Fresnoy declaim, Who talk of Raphael's matchless fame, Of Titian's tints, Corregio's grace, And Carlo's each Madonna face, As if no Beauties now were made, But Nature had forgot her trade. 'Twas Beauty guided Raphael's line From heavenly Women, styl'd divine; They warm'd old Titian's fancy too, And what he could not taste he drew: Think you Devotion warm'd his breast When Carlo with such looks express'd His virgins, that her vot'ries feel Emotions—not, I'm sure, of zeal? In Britian's isle observe the Fair, And curious chuse your models there; Such patterns as shall raise your name To rival sweet Corregio's fame: Each single piece shall be a test, And Zeuxis' patchwork be a jest, Who ransack'd Greece, and cull'd the age To bring one Goddess on the stage: On your each convass we'll admire The charms of the whole heav'nly choir. Majestick Juno shall be seen In Miss Harvey, now Mrs. Phipps. Harvey's glorious aweful mien. Where Lady Caroline Fitzroy. Fitzroy moves, resplendent Fair; So warm her bloom, sublime her air; Her ebon tresses, form'd to grace, And heighten while they shade her face: Such troops of martial youth around, Who court the hand that gives the wound; 'Tis Pallas, Pallas stands confess'd, Tho' Lord Petersham, Stanhope's more than Paris bless'd. So The Duchess of Cleveland like Pallas, among the beauties at Windsor. Cleveland shown in warlike pride, By Lilly's pencil defy'd: So The Duchess of Grafton, among the beauties of Hampton Court. Grafton, matchless dame, commands The fairest work of Kneller's hands: The blood that warm'd each amorous court, In veins as rich still loves to sport: And George's age beholds restor'd, What William boasted, Charles ador'd. For Venuses the Trojan ne'er Was half so puzzled to declare: Ten Queens of Beauty, sure I see! Yet sure the true is Lady Emily Lenox, now Countess of Kildare Emily: Such majesty of youth and air, Yet modest as the village fair: Attracting all, indulging none, Her beauty like the glorious Sun Thron'd eminently bright above, Impartial warms the world to love. In smiling Lady Mary Capel. Capel's beauteous look Rich Autumn's Goddess is mistook, With poppies and with spiky corn, Eckardt, her nut-brown curls adorn; And by her side, in decent line, Place charming Countess of Berkley. Berkley, Proserpine. Mild as a summer sea, serene, In dimpled beauty next be seen, Countess of Aylesbury. Aylesbury like hoary Neptune's Queen. With her the light-dispensing Fair, Whose beauty gilds the morning air, And bright as her attendant sun, The new Aurora, Mrs Lyttleton. Lyttleton. Such Guido's Aurora in the Respigliori Palace at Rome. Guido's pencil beauty-tip'd, And in ethereal colours dip'd. In measur'd dance to tuneful song Drew the sweet Goddess, as along Heaven's azure 'neath their light feet spread, The buxom Hours she fairest led. The crescent on her brow display'd, In curls of loveliest brown inlaid, With every charm to rule the night, Like Dian, Countess of Strafford. Strafford woos the sight; The easy shape, the piercing eye, The snowy bosom's purity, The unaffected gentle phrase Of native wit in all she says; Eckardt, for these thy art's too faint: You may admire, but cannot paint. How Hebe smil'd, what bloom divine On the young Goddess lov'd to shine, From Miss Carpenter. Carpenter we guess, or see All-beauteous Miss Manners. Manners beam for thee. How pretty Flora, wanton maid, By Zephyr woo'd in noon-tide shade, With rosy hand coquetly throwing Pansies, beneath her sweet touch blowing; How blithe she look'd let Miss Fanny Maccartney. Fanny tell; Let Zephyr own if half so well. Another Pomona. Goddess of the year, Fair Queen of Summer, see, appear; Her auburn locks with fruitage crown'd, Her panting bosom loosely bound, Ethereal beauty in her face, Rather the beauties of her race, Whence ev'ry Goddess, envy smit, Most own each Stonehouse meets in Miss Atkins, now Mrs. Pitt. Pitt, Exhausted all the heav'nly train, How many Mortals yet remain, Whose eyes shall try your pencil's art, And in my numbers claim a part! Our sister Muses must describe M. Chudleigh. Chudleigh, or name her of the tribe; And L. Juliana Farmor. Juliana with the Nine Shall aid the melancholy line, To weep her dear L. Sophia Farmor, Countess of Granville. Resemblance gone, Where all these beauties met in One. Sad fate of beauty! more I see, Afflicted, lovely family! Two beauteous Nymphs, here, Painter, place, Lamenting o'er their Miss Mary Evelyn, sister Grace; Mrs. Boone.One, matron-like, with sober grief, Scarce gives her pious sighs relief; While Mrs. Elizabeth Evelyn. t'other lovely Maid appears In all the melting pow'r of tears; The softest form, the gentlest grace, The sweetest harmony of face; Her snowy limbs, and artless move Contending with the Queen of Love, While bashful Beauty shuns the prize, Which Emily might yield to Evelyn's eyes. EPILOGUE to Tamerlane. On the Suppression of the Rebellion. Spoken by Mrs. Pritchard, in the Character of the Comick Muse, Nov. 4, 1746. By the same.

But Laws and Liberties are trifling treasures: He threaten'd that grave property, your Pleasures. For me, an idle Muse, I ne'er dissembled My fears; but ev'n my tragick Sister trembled: O'er all her sons she cast her mournful eyes, And heav'd her breast more than dramatick sighs; To eyes well tutor'd in the trade of grief, She rais'd a small and well lac'd handkerchief; And then with decent pause—and accent broke, Her buskin'd progeny the Dame bespoke: “Ah!

Ut! mihi devio Rupes, &amp; vacuum nemus Mirari libet! Horace. Ye green-rob'd Dryads, oft' at dusky eve By wondering shepherds seen, to forests brown, To unfrequented meads, and pathless wilds, Lead me from gardens deck'd with art's vain pomps. Can gilt alcoves, can marble-mimic gods, Parterres embroider'd, obelisks, and urns Of high relief; can the long, spreading lake, Or vista lessening to the sight; can Stow, With all her Attic fanes, such raptures raise, As the thrush-haunted copse, where lightly leaps The fearful fawn the rustling leaves along, And the brisk squirrel sports from bough to bough, While from an hollow oak, whose naked roots O'erhang a pensive rill, the busy bees Hum drowsy lullabies? The bards of old, Fair Nature's friends, sought such retreats, to charm Sweet Echo with their songs; oft' too they met In summer evenings, near sequester'd bow'rs, Or mountain-nymph, or muse, and eager learnt The moral strains she taught to mend mankind. As to a secret grot Ægeria stole With patriot Numa, and in silent night Whisper'd him sacred laws, he list'ning sat Rapt with her virtuous voice, old Tyber lean'd Attentive on his urn, and hush'd his waves. Rich in her weeping country's spoils Versailles May boast a thousand fountains, that can cast The tortur'd waters to the distant heav'ns; Yet let me choose some pine-topt precipice Abrupt and shaggy, whence a foamy stream, Like Anio, tumbling roars; or some black heath, Where straggling stands the mournful juniper, Or yew-tree scath'd; while in clear prospect round, From the grove's bosom spires emerge, and smoak In bluish wreaths ascends, ripe harvests wave, Low, lonely cottages, and ruin'd tops Of Gothick battlements appear, and streams Beneath the sun-beams twinkle.—The shrill lark, That wakes the wood-man to his early task, Or love-sick Philomel, whose luscious lays Sooth lone night-wanderers, the moaning dove Pitied by listening milk-maid, far excel The deep-mouth viol, the soul-lulling lute, And battle-breathing trumpet. Artful sounds! That please not like the choristers of air, When first they hail th'approach of laughing May. Can Kent design like Nature? Mark where Thames Plenty and pleasure pours thro' The earl of Lincoln's terrace at Weybridge in Surrey. Lincoln's meads; Can the great artist, tho' with taste supreme Endu'd, one beauty to this Eden add? Tho' he, by rules unfetter'd, boldly scorns Formality and Method, round and square Disdaining, plans irregularly great. Creative Titian, can thy vivid strokes, Or thine, O graceful Raphael, dare to vie With the rich tints that paint the breathing mead? The thousand-colour'd tulip, violet's bell Snow-clad and meek, the vermil-tinctur'd rose, And golden crocus?—Yet with these the maid, Phillis or Phœbe at a feast or wake, Her jetty locks enamels; fairer she, In innocence and home-spun vestments dress'd, Than if cœrulean saphires at her ears Shone pendent, or a precious diamond-cross Heav'd gently on her panting bosom white. Yon' shepherd idly stretch'd on the rude rock, Listening to dashing waves, and sea mews' clang High-hovering o'er his head, who views beneath The dolphin dancing o'er the level brine, Feels more true bliss than the proud ammiral, Amid his vessels bright with burnish'd gold And silken streamers, tho' his lordly nod Ten thousand war-worn mariners revere. And great Æneas Æneid VIII. gaz'd with more delight On the rough mountain shagg'd with horrid shades, (Where cloud-compelling Jove, as fancy dream'd, Descending shook his direful Ægis black) Than if he enter'd the high Capitol On golden columns rear'd, a conquer'd world Exhausted, to enrich its stately head. More pleas'd he slept in poor Evander's cott On shaggy skins, lull'd by sweet nightingales, Than if a Nero, in an age refin'd, Beneath a gorgeous canopy had plac'd His royal guest, and bade his minstrels sound Soft slumb'rous Lydian airs, to sooth his rest. See Lucretius, lib. V.Happy the first of men, ere yet confin'd To smoaky cities; who in sheltering groves, Warm caves, and deep-sunk vallies liv'd and lov'd, By cares unwounded; what the sun and showers, And genial earth untillag'd could produce, They gather'd grateful, or the acorn brown, Or blushing berry; by the liquid lapse Of murm'ring waters call'd to slake their thirst, Or with fair nymphs their sun-brown limbs to bathe; With nymphs who fondly clasp'd their fav'rite youths, Unaw'd by shame, beneath the beechen shade, Nor wiles, nor artificial coyness knew. Then doors and walls were not; the melting maid Nor frowns of parents fear'd, nor husband's threats; Nor had curs'd gold their tender hearts allur'd: Then beauty was not venal. Injur'd love, O whither, god of raptures, art thou fled? While Avarice waves his golden wand around, Abhorr'd magician, and his costly cup Prepares with baneful drugs, t'enchant the souls Of each low-thoughted fair to wed for gain. In earth's first infancy (as sung the Lucretius. bard, Who strongly painted what he boldly thought) Tho' the fierce north oft smote with iron whip Their shiv'ring limbs, tho' oft the bristly boar Or hungry lion 'woke them with their howls, And scar'd them from their moss-grown caves to rove Houseless and cold in dark tempestuous nights; Yet were not myriads in embattel'd fields Swept off at once, nor had the raging seas O'erwhelm'd the found'ring bark and shrieking crew; In vain the glassy ocean smil'd to tempt The jolly sailor unsuspecting harm, For commerce ne'er had spread her swelling sails, Nor had the wond'ring Nereids ever heard The dashing oar: then famine, want, and pine, Sunk to the grave their fainting limbs; but us, Diseaseful dainties, riot and excess, And feverish luxury destroy. In brakes, Or marshes wild unknowingly they crop'd Herbs of malignant juice; to realms remote While we for powerful poisons madly roam, From every noxious herb collecting death. What tho' unknown to those primæval sires The well-arch'd dome, peopled with breathing forms By fair Italia's skilful hand, unknown The shapely column, and the crumbling busts Of aweful ancestors in long descent? Yet why should man mistaken deem it nobler To dwell in palaces, and high-roof'd halls, Than in God's forests, architect supreme! Say, is the Persian carpet, than the field's Or meadow's mantle gay, more richly wov'n; Or softer to the votaries of ease Than bladed grass, perfum'd with dew-dropt flow'rs? O taste corrupt! that luxury and pomp, In specious names of polish'd manners veil'd, Should proudly banish Nature's simple charms! All-beauteous Nature! by thy boundless charms Oppress'd, O where shall I begin thy praise, Where turn th'ecstatic eye, how ease my breast That pants with wild astonishment and love! Dark forests, and the op'ning lawn, refresh'd With ever-gushing brooks, hill, meadow, dale, The balmy bean-field, the gay-clover'd close, So sweetly interchang'd, the lowing ox, The playful lamb, the distant water-fall Now faintly heard, now swelling with the breeze, The sound of pastoral reed from hazel-bower, The choral birds, the neighing steed, that snuffs His dappled mate, stung with intense desire, The ripen'd orchard when the ruddy orbs Betwixt the green leaves blush, the azure skies, The chearful sun that thro' earth's vitals pours Delight and health and heat; all, all conspire, To raise, to sooth, to harmonize the mind, To lift on wings of praise, to the great Sire Of being and of beauty, at whose nod Creation started from the gloomy vault Of dreary Chaos, while the griesly king Murmur'd to feel his boisterous power confin'd. What are the lays of artful Addison, Coldly correct, to Shakespear's warblings wild? Whom on the winding Avon's willow'd banks Fair Fancy found, and bore the smiling babe To a close cavern: (still the shepherds shew The sacred place, whence with religious awe They hear, returning from the field at eve, Strange whisp'rings of sweet musick thro' the air) Here, as with honey gather'd from the rock, She fed the little prattler, and with songs Oft' sooth'd his wand'ring ears, with deep delight On her soft lap he sat, and caught the sounds. Oft near some crowded city would I walk, Listening the far-off noises, rattling cars, Loud shouts of joy, sad shrieks of sorrow, knells Full slowly tolling, instruments of trade, Striking mine ears with one deep-swelling hum. Or wand'ring near the sea, attend the sounds Of hollow winds, and ever-beating waves, Ev'n when wild tempests swallow up the plains, And Boreas' blasts, big hail, and rains combine To shake the groves and mountains, would I sit, Pensively musing on th'outrageous crimes That wake heav'n's vengeance: at such solemn hours, Dæmons and goblins thro' the dark air shriek, While Hecat, with her black-brow'd sisters nine, Rides o'er the earth, and scatters woes and death. Then too, they say, in dear Ægyptian wilds The lion and the tiger prowl for prey With roarings loud! the list'ning traveller Starts fear-struck, while the hollow-echoing vaults Of pyramids increase the deathful sounds. But let me never fail in cloudless nights, When silent Cynthia in her silver car Thro' the blue concave slides, when shine the hills, Twinkle the streams, and woods look tip'd with gold, To seek some level mead, and there invoke Old Midnight's sister Contemplation sage, (Queen of the rugged brow, and stern-fixt eye) To lift my soul above this little earth, This folly-fetter'd world: to purge my ears, That I may hear the rolling planet's song, And tuneful turning spheres: if this debarr'd. The little Fayes that dance in neighbouring dales, Sipping the night-dew, while they laugh and love, Shall charm me with aërial notes.—As thus I wander musing, lo, what aweful forms Yonder appear! sharp-ey'd Philosophy Clad in dun robes, an eagle on his wrist, First meets my eye; next, virgin Solitude Serene, who blushes at each gazer's sight; Then Wisdom's hoary head, with crutch in hand, Trembling, and bent with age; last Virtue's self Smiling, in white array'd, who with her leads Sweet Innocence, that prattles by her side, A naked boy!—Harrass'd with fear I stop, I gaze, when Virtue thus—‘Whoe'er thou art, ‘Mortal, by whom I deign to be beheld ‘In these my midnight-walks; depart, and say ‘That henceforth I and my immortal train ‘Forsake Britannia's isle; who fondly stoops ‘To Vice, her favourite paramour.’—She spoke, And as she turn'd, her round and rosy neck, Her flowing train, and long ambrosial hair, Breathing rich odours, I enamour'd view. O who will bear me then to western climes, (Since Virtue leaves our wretched land) to fields Yet unpolluted with Iberian swords: The isles of innocence, from mortal view Deeply retir'd, beneath a plantane's shade, Where Happiness and Quiet sit enthron'd, With simple Indian swains, that I may hunt The boar and tiger thro' Savannah's wild, Thro' fragrant desarts, and thro' citron-groves. There fed on dates and herbs, would I despise The far-fetch'd cates of Luxury, and hoards Of narrow-hearted Avarice; nor heed The distant din of the tumultuous world. So when rude whirlwinds rouze the roaring main, Beneath fair Thetis sits, in choral caves, Serenely gay, nor sinking sailors' cries Disturb her sportive nymphs, who round her form The light fantastick dance, or for her hair Weave rosy crowns, or with according lutes Grace the soft warbles of her honied voice. ODE to FANCY. By the Same. O parent of each lovely Muse, Thy spirit o'er my soul diffuse, O'er all my artless songs preside, My footsteps to thy temple guide, To offer at thy turf-built shrine, In golden cups no costly wine, No murder'd fat'ling of the flock, But flowers and honey from the rock. O Nymph with loosely-flowing hair, With buskin'd leg, and bosom bare, Thy waist with myrtle-girdle bound, Thy brows with Indian feathers crown'd, Waving in thy snowy hand An all-commanding magick wand, Of pow'r to bid fresh gardens blow 'Mid chearless Lapland's barren snow, Whose rapid wings thy flight convey Thro' air, and over earth and sea, While the vast various landscape lies Conspicuous to thy piercing eyes. O lover of the desart, hail! Say, in what deep and pathless vale, Or on what hoary mountain's side, 'Mid fall of waters you reside, 'Mid broken rocks, a rugged scene, With green and grassy dales between, 'Mid forests dark of aged oak, Ne'er echoing with the woodman's stroke, Where never human art appear'd, Nor ev'n one straw-roof'd cott was rear'd, Where Nature seems to sit alone, Majestick on a craggy throne; Tell me the path, sweet wand'rer, tell, To thy unknown sequester'd cell, Where woodbines cluster round the door, Where shells and moss o'erlay the floor, And on whose top an hawthorn blows, Amid whose thickly-woven boughs Some nightingale still builds her nest, Each evening warbling thee to rest: There lay me by the haunted stream, Rapt in some wild, poetick dream, In converse while methinks I rove With Spenser thro' a fairy grove; Till suddenly awoke, I hear Strange whisper'd musick in my ear, And my glad soul in bliss is drown'd By the sweetly-soothing sound! Me, Goddess, by the right-hand lead, Sometimes thro' the yellow mead, Where Joy and white-rob'd Peace resort, And Venus keeps her festive court, Where Mirth and Youth each evening meet, And lightly trip with nimble feet, Nodding their lilly-crowned heads, Where Laughter rose-lip'd Hebe leads: Where Echo walks steep hills among, List'ning to the shepherd's song: Yet not these flowery fields of joy Can long my pensive mind employ, Haste, Fancy, from these scenes of folly To meet the matron Melancholy, Goddess of the tearful eye, That loves to fold her arms and sigh! Let us with silent footsteps go To charnels and the house of woe, To Gothick churches, vaults, and tombs, Where each sad night some virgin comes, With throbbing breast, and faded cheek, Her promis'd bridegroom's urn to seek; Or to some abbey's mould'ring tow'rs, Where to avoid cold wintry show'rs, The naked beggar shivering lies, While whistling tempests round her rise, And trembles lest the tottering wall Should on her sleeping infants fall. Now let us louder strike the lyre, For my heart glows with martial fire, I feel, I feel, with sudden heat, My big tumultuous bosom beat; The trumpet's clangors pierce my ear, A thousand widows' shrieks I hear, Give me another horse, I cry, Lo! the base Gallic squadrons fly; Whence is this rage?—what spirit, say, To battle hurries me away? 'Tis Fancy, in her fiery car, Transports me to the thickest war, There whirls me o'er the hills of slain, Where Tumult and Destruction reign; Where mad with pain, the wounded steed Tramples the dying and the dead: Where giant Terror stalks around, With sullen joy surveys the ground, And pointing to th'ensanguin'd field, Shakes his dreadful Gorgon-shield! O guide me from this horrid scene To high-arch'd walks and alleys green, Which lovely Laura seeks, to shun The fervors of the mid-day sun; The pangs of absence, O remove, For thou can'st place me near my love, Can'st fold in visionary bliss, And let me think I steal a kiss, While her ruby lips dispense Luscious nectar's quintessence! When young-ey'd Spring profusely throws From her green lap the pink and rose, When the soft turtle of the dale To Summer tells her tender tale, To Autumn cooling caverns seeks, And stains with wine his jolly cheeks, When Winter, like poor pilgrim old, Shakes his silver beard with cold, At every season let my ear Thy solemn whispers, Fancy, hear. O warm, enthusiastick maid, Without thy powerful, vital aid, That breathes an energy divine, That gives a soul to every line, Ne'er may I strive with lips profane To utter an unhallow'd strain, Nor dare to touch the sacred string, Save when with smiles thou bid'st me sing. O hear our prayer, O hither come From thy lamented Shakespear's tomb, On which thou lov'st to sit at eve, Musing o'er thy darling's grave; O queen of numbers, once again Animate some chosen swain, Who fill'd with unexhausted fire, May boldly smite the sounding lyre, May rise above the rhyming throng, Who with some new, unequall'd song O'er all our list'ning passions reign, O'erwhelm our souls with joy and pain; With terror shake, with pity move, Rouse with revenge, or melt with love. O deign t'attend his evening walk, With him in groves and grottos talk: Teach him to scorn with frigid art Feebly to touch th'unraptur'd heart; Like lightning, let his mighty verse The bosom's inmost foldings pierce; With native beauties win applause, Beyond cold criticks' studied laws: O let each muse's fame increase, O bid Britannia rival Greece! Stanzas written on taking the Air after a long Illness. By the same. I Hail, genial sun! I feel thy powerful ray Strike vigorous health into each languid vein; Lo, at thy bright approach, are fled away The pale-ey'd sisters Grief, Disease, and Pain. II O hills, O forests, and thou painted mead, Again admit me to your secret seats, From the dark bed of pining sickness free'd, With double joy I seek your green retreats. III Yet once more, O ye rivers, shall I lie, In summer evenings on your willow'd banks, And unobserv'd by passing shepherd's eye, View the light Naiads trip in wanton ranks. IV Each rural object charms, so long unseen, The blooming orchards, the white wand'ring flocks, The fields array'd in sight-refreshing green, And with his loosen'd yoke the wearied ox. V Here let me stop beneath this spreading bush, While Zephyr's voice I hear the boughs among, And listen to the sweet thick-warbling thrush, Much have I wish'd to hear her vernal song. VI The Dryad Health frequents this hallow'd grove, O where may I the lovely virgin meet? From morn to dewy evening will I rove To find her haunts, and lay an off'ring at her feet. The Two Beavers. A Fable. By the Rev. Mr. Duck. 'Twere well, my friend, for human kind, Would ev'ry man his bus'ness mind; In his own orbit always move, Nor blame, nor envy those above. A Beaver, well advanc'd in age, By long experience render'd sage, Was skill'd in all the useful arts, And justly deem'd a beast of parts; Which he apply'd (as patriots shou'd) In cultivating publick good. This Beaver on a certain day, A friendly visit went to pay To a young cousin, pert and vain, Who often rov'd about the plain: With ev'ry idle beast conferr'd, Hearing, and telling what he heard. The vagrant youth was gone from home, When th'ancient sage approach'd his dome; Who each apartment view'd with care, But found each wanted much repair. The walls were crack'd, decay'd the doors, The corn lay mouldy on the floors; Thro' gaping crannies rush'd amain The blust'ring winds with snow and rain; The timber all was rotten grown,— In short, the house was tumbling down. The gen'rous beast, by pity sway'd, Griev'd to behold it thus decay'd; And while he mourn'd the tatter'd scene, The master of the lodge came in. The first congratulations o'er, They rest recumbent on the floor; When thus the young conceited beast His thoughts impertinent express'd. I long have been surpriz'd to find, The lion grown so wond'rous kind To one peculiar sort of beasts, While he another sort detests; His royal favour chiefly falls Upon the species of jack-alls; They share the profits of his throne, He smiles on them, and them alone. Mean while the ferret's useful race He scarce admits to see his face; Traduc'd by lies and ill report, They're banish'd from his regal court, And counted, over all the plain, Opposers of the lion's reign. Now I conceiv'd a scheme last night, Would doubtless set this matter right: These parties should unite together; The lion partial be to neither, But let them both his favours share, And both consult in peace and war. This method (were this method try'd) Would spread politick basis wide, And on a bottom broad and strong, Support the social union long— But uncle, uncle, much I fear, Some have abus'd the lion's ear; He listens to the leopard's tongue; That cursed leopard leads him wrong: Were he but banish'd far away— You don't attend to what I say! Why really, couz, the sage rejoin'd, The rain and snow, and driving wind, Beat thro' with such prodigious force, It made me deaf to your discourse. Now couz, were my advice pursu'd, (And sure I mean it for your good) Methinks you should this house repair; Be this your first and chiefest care. Your skill the voice of prudence calls To stop these crannies in the walls, And prop the roof before it falls. If you this needful task perform, You'll make your mansion dry and warm; And we may then converse together, Secure from this tempestuous weather. CONTENTMENT. By the Same. Farewell aspiring thoughts, no more My soul shall leave the peaceful shore, To sail Ambition's main; Fallacious as the harlot's kiss, You promise me uncertain bliss, And give me certain pain. A beauteous prospect first you shew, Which ere survey'd you paint anew, And paint it wond'rous pleasant: This in a third is quickly lost: Thus future good we covet most, But ne'er enjoy the present. Deluded on from scene to scene, We never end, but still begin, By flatt'ring Hope betray'd; I'm weary of the painful chace, Let others run this endless race To catch a flying shade. Let others boast their useless wealth; Have I not honesty and health? Which riches cannot give: Let others to preferment soar, And, changing liberty for pow'r, In golden shackles live. 'Tis time, at length, I should be wise, 'Tis time to seek substantial joys; Joys out of Fortune's pow'r: Wealth, honours, dignities, and fame, Are toys the blind capricious dame Takes from us ev'ry hour. Come, conscious Virtue, fill my breast, And bring Content, thy daughter, dress'd In ever-smiling charms: Let sacred Friendship too attend; A friendship worthy of my friend, Such as my Lælius warms. With these I'll in my bosom make A bulwark Fortune cannot shake, Tho' all her storms arise; Look down and pity gilded slaves, Despise Ambition's giddy knaves, And wish the Fools were wise. The Education of ACHILLES. By Mr. BEDINGFIELD. I Ah me! is all our pleasure mix'd with woe! Is there on earth no happiness sincere? Must e'en this bitter stream of sorrow flow From joy's domestick spring, our children dear? How oft did Thetis drop the silver tear, When with fond eyes she view'd her darling boy! How oft her breast heav'd with presaging fear, Lest vice's secret canker should annoy Fair virtue's op'ning bud, and all her hopes destroy! II At length, so Nereus had her rightly taught, That doubtful cares might eat her heart no more, Her imp in prattling infancy she brought To the fam'd Centaur, on mount Pelion hoar, Hight Chiron, whom to Saturn Phyl'ra bore; Chiron, whose wisdom flourish'd 'bove his peers, In ev'ry goodly thew, and virtuous lore, To principle his yet untainted years; The seed that's early sown, the fairest harvest bears. III Far in the covert of a bushy wood, Where aged trees their star-proof branches spread, A grott, with grey moss ever dropping stood; Ne costly gems the sparkling roof display'd, Ne crystal squares the pavement rich inlaid, But o'er the pebbles, clear with glassy shine, A limpid stream in soothing murmurs stray'd, And all around the flow'ring eglantine Its balmy tendrils spread in many a wanton twine. IV A lowly habitation, well I ween, Yet sacred made by men of mickle fame, Who there in precepts wise had lesson'd been; Chaste Peleus, consort of the sea-born dame, Sage Æsculape, who cou'd the vital flame (Blest leach!) relumine by his healing skill; And Jason, who, his father's crown to claim, Descended dreadful from the craggy hill, And with his portence stern did false usurper thrill. V Fast by the cave a damsel was ypight, Afraid from earth her blushing looks to rear, Lest aught indecent shou'd offend her sight, Lest aught indecent shou'd offend her ear; Yet wou'd she sometime deign at sober chear Softly to smile, but ever held it shame The mirth of foul-mouth'd ribaldry to bear, A cautious nymph, and Modesty her name. Ah! who but churlish carle would hurt so pure a dame? VI With her sate Temperance, companion meet, Plucking from tree-en bough her simple food, And pointing to an urn beside her feet, Fill'd with the crystal of the wholesome flood: With her was seen, of grave and aweful mood, Hoary Fidelity, a matron staid; And sweet Benevolence, who smiling stood, Whilst at her breast two fondling infants play'd, And turtles, billing soft, coo'd thro' the echoing glade. VII On t'other side, of bold and open air, Was a fair personage hight Exercise; Reclin'd he seem'd upon his rough boar-spear, As late surceas'd from hardy enterprize; (For Sloth inglorious did he aye despise) Fresh glow'd his cheek with health's vermilion dye, On his sleek brow the swelling sweat-drops rise, And oft around he darts his glowing eye To view his well-breath'd hounds, full jolly company. VIII Not far away was sage Experience plac'd, With care-knit brow, fix'd looks, and sober plight, Who weighing well the present with the past, Of every accident cou'd read aright. With him was rev'rend Contemplation pight, Bow-bent with eld, his beard of snowy hue, Yet age's hand mote not empare the sight, Still with sharp ken the eagle he'd pursue, As thro' the buxom air to heav'n's bright bow'rs she flew. IX Here the fond parent left her darling care, Yet softly breath'd a sigh as she withdrew; Here the young hero, ev'n from tender year, Eftsoons imbib'd Instruction's hony'd dew, (For well to file his tongue, sage Chiron knew) And learnt to discipline his life aright; To pay to pow'rs supreme a reverence due, Chief to Saturnian Jove, whose dreaded might Wings thro' disparted clouds the bik'ring light'ning's flight. X Aye was the stripling wont, ere morning fair Had rear'd o'er eastern waves her rosy tede, To grasp with tender hand the pointed spear, And beat the thicket where the boar's fell breed Enshrouded lay, or lion's tawny seed. Oft wou'd great Dian, with her woody train, Stop in mid chace to wonder at his speed, Whilst up the hill's rough side she saw him strain, Or sweep with winged feet along the level plain. XI And when dun shades had blent the day's bright eye, Upon his shoulders, with slow stagg'ring pace, He brought the prey his hand had done to die, Whilst blood with dust besprent did foul disgrace The goodly features of his glowing face. When as the sage beheld on grassy soil Each panting corse, whilst life did well apace, The panther of his spotted pride he'd spoil, To deck his foster son: fit need of daring toil. XII And ever and anon the godlike sire, To temper stern behests with pleasaunce gay, Would touch (for well he cou'd) the silver lyre; So sweetly ravish'd each enchanting lay, That Pan, in scornful wise, wou'd fling away His rustick pipe, and e'en the sacred train Wou'd leave their lov'd Parnass' in trim array, And thought their own Apollo once again Charm'd his attentive flock, a simple shepherd swain. XIII And ever and anon of worthies old, Whose praise Fame's trump thro' earth's wide bounds had spread, To fire his mind to brave exploits, he told; Pirithous, known for prowest hardy-head; Theseus, whose wrath the dire Procrustes fled; And Hercules, whom trembling Lerna fear'd, When Hydra fell, in loathsome marshes bred, In vain against the son of Jove uprear'd Head sprouting under head, by thrillant faulchion shear'd. XIV The stern-brow'd boy in mute attention stood, To hear the sage relate each great emprise; Then strode along the cave in haughtier mood, Whilst varying passions in his bosom rise, And lightning-beams flash from his glowing eyes. Ev'n now he scorns the prey the desarts yield, Ev'n now (as hope the future scene supplies) He shakes the terror of his heav'n-form'd shield, And braves th'indignant flood, and thunders o'er the field. An EPISTLE from S. J. Esq; in the Country, to the Right Hon. the Lord Lovelace in Town. Written in the Year 1735. In days, my Lord, when mother Time, Tho' now grown old, was in her prime, When Saturn first began to rule, And Jove was hardly come from school, How happy was a country life! How free from wickedness and strife! Then each man liv'd upon his farm, And thought and did no mortal harm; On mossy banks fair virgins slept, As harmless as the flocks they kept; Then love was all they had to do, And nymphs were chaste, and swains were true. But now, whatever poets write, 'Tis sure the case is alter'd quite, Virtue no more in rural plains, Or innocence, or peace remains; But vice is in the cottage found, And country girls are oft unsound; Fierce party-rage each village fires, With wars of justices and 'squires; Attorneys, for a barley straw, Whole ages hamper folks in law; And ev'ry neighbour's in a flame About their rates, or tythes, or game: Some quarrel for their hares and pigeons, And some for diff'rence in religions: Some hold their parson the best preacher, The tinker some a better teacher; These to the Church they fight for, strangers Have faith in nothing but her dangers; While those, a more believing people, Can swallow all things—but a steeple. But I, my Lord, who, as you know, Care little how these matters go, And equally detest the strife And usual joys of country life, Have by good fortune little share Of its diversions, or its care; For seldom I with 'squires unite, Who hunt all day, and drink all night; Nor reckon wonderful inviting, A quarter-sessions, or cock-fighting; But then no farm I occupy, With sheep to rot and cows to dye: Nor rage I much, or much despair, Tho' in my hedge I find a snare; Nor view I, with due admiration, All the high honours here in fashion; The great commissions of the quorum, Terrors to all who come before 'em; Militia scarlet, edg'd with gold, Or the white staff high-sheriffs hold; The representative's caressing, The judge's bow, the bishop's blessing. Nor can I for my soul delight In the dull feast of neighb'ring knight, Who, if you send three days before, In white gloves meets you at the door, With superfluity of breeding First makes you sick, and then with feeding. Or if with ceremony cloy'd, You wou'd next time such plagues avoid, And visit without previous notice, John, John, a coach!—I can't think who 'tis, My lady cries, who spies your coach, Ere you the avenue approach; Lord, how unlucky!—washing-day! And all the men are in the hay! Entrance to gain is something hard, The dogs all bark, the gates are barr'd; The yard's with lines of linen cross'd, The hall-door's lock'd, the key is lost: These difficulties all o'ercome, We reach at length the drawing-room, Then there's such trampling over-head, Madam you'd swear was brought to bed; Miss in a hurry bursts the lock, To get clean sleeves to hide her smock; The servants run, the pewter clatters, My lady dresses, calls, and chatters; The cook-maid raves for want of butter, Pigs squeak, fowls scream, and green geese flutter. Now after three hours tedious waiting, On all our neighbours faults debating, And having nine times view'd the garden, In which there's nothing worth a farthing, In comes my lady, and the pudden: You will excuse, sir,—on a sudden— Then, that we may have four and four, The bacon, fowls, and colly-flow'r Their ancient unity divide, The top one graces, one each side; And by and by the second course Comes lagging like a distanc'd horse: A salver then to church and king, The butler sweats, the glasses ring; The cloth remov'd, the toasts go round, Bawdy and politicks abound; And as the knight more tipsy waxes, We damn all ministers and taxes. At last the ruddy sun quite sunk, The coachman tolerably drunk, Whirling o'er hillocks, ruts, and stones, Enough to dislocate one's bones, We home return, a wond'rous token Of heaven's kind care, with limbs unbroken. Afflict us not, ye Gods, tho' sinners, With many days like this, or dinners! But if civilities thus teaze me, Nor business, nor diversions please me, You'll ask, my Lord, how time I spend? I answer, with a book, or friend: The circulating hours dividing 'Twixt reading, walking, eating, riding: But books are still my highest joy, These earliest please, and latest cloy. Sometimes o'er distant climes I stray, By guides experienc'd taught the way; The wonders of each region view, From frozen Lapland to Peru; Bound o'er rough seas, and mountains bare, Yet ne'er forsake my elbow chair. Sometimes some fam'd historian's pen Recals past ages back agen, Where all I see, through every page, Is but how men with senseless rage Each other rob, destroy, and burn, To serve a priest's, or statesman's turn Tho' loaded with a diff'rent aim, Yet always asses much the same. Sometimes I view with much delight, Divines their holy game-cocks fight; Here faith and works at variance set, Strive hard who shall the victory get; Presbytery and episcopacy There fight so long, it would amaze ye: Here free-will holds a fierce dispute With reprobation absolute; There sense kicks transubstantiation, And reason pecks at revelation. With learned Newton now I fly O'er all the rolling orbs on high, Visit new worlds, and for a minute This old one scorn, and all that's in it: And now with labouring Boyle I trace Nature thro' ev'ry winding maze, The latent qualities admire Of vapours, water, air, and fire: With pleasing admiration see Matter's surprizing subtlety; As how the smallest lamp displays, For miles around, its scatter'd rays; Or how (the case still more t'explain) See Boyle's Experiments.A fart that weighs not half a grain, The atmosphere will oft perfume Of a whole spacious drawing-room. Sometimes I pass a whole long day In happy indolence away, In fondly meditating o'er Past pleasures, and in hoping more: Or wander thro' the fields and woods, And gardens bath'd in circling floods, There blooming flow'rs with rapture view, And sparkling gems of morning dew, Whence in my mind ideas rise Of Cælia's cheeks, and Chloe's eyes. 'Tis thus, my Lord, I, free from strife, Spend an inglorious country life; These are the joys I still pursue, When absent from the town and you: Thus pass long summer suns away, Busily idle, calmly gay; Nor great, nor mean, nor rich, nor poor, Not having much, or wishing more; Except that you, when weary grown Of all the follies of the town, And seeing, in all publick places, The same vain sops and painted faces, Wou'd sometimes kindly condescend To visit a dull country friend: Here you'll be ever sure to meet A hearty welcome, tho' no treat, One who has nothing else to do, But to divert himself and you: A house, where quiet guards the door, No rural wits smoak, drink and roar; Choice books, safe horses, wholsome liquor, Clean girls, backgammon, and the vicar. To a LADY in Town, soon after her leaving the Country. By the Same. Whilst you, dear maid, o'er thousands born to reign, For the gay town exchange the rural plain, The cooling breeze and ev'ning walk forsake For stifling crowds, which your own beauties make; Thro' circling joys while you incessant stray, Charm in the Mall, and sparkle at the play; Think (if successive vanities can spare One thought to love) what cruel pangs I bear, Left in these plains all wretched, and alone, To weep with fountains, and with echoes groan, And mourn incessantly that fatal day, That all my bliss with Chloe snatch'd away. Say, by what arts I can relieve my pain, Musick, verse, all I try, but try in vain; In vain the breathing flute my hand employs, Late the companion of my Chloe's voice. Nor Handel's, nor Corelli's tuneful airs Can harmonize my soul, or sooth my cares; Those once-lov'd med'cines unsuccessful prove, Musick, alas, is but the voice of love! In vain I oft harmonious lines peruse, And seek for aid from Pope's and Prior's Muse; Their treach'rous numbers but assist the foe, And call forth scenes of sympathising woe; Here Heloise mourns her absent lover's charms, There panting Emma sighs in Henry's arms; Their loves like mine ill-fated I bemoan, And in their tender sorrows read my own. Restless sometimes, as oft the mournful dove Forsakes her nest forsaken by her love, I fly from home, and seek the sacred fields, Where Cam's old urn its silver current yields, Where solemn tow'rs o'er-look each mossy grove, As if to guard it from th'assaults of love; Yet guard in vain, for there my Chloe's eyes But lately made whole colleges her prize; Her sons, tho' few, not Pallas cou'd defend, Nor Dullness succour to her thousands lend; Love like a fever with infectious rage Scorch'd up the young, and thaw'd the frost of age; To gaze at her, ev'n Dons are seen to run, And leave unfinish'd pipes, and authors—scarce begun. So Helen look'd, and mov'd with such a grace, When the grave seniors of the Trojan race Were forc'd those fatal beauties to admire, That all their youth consum'd, and set their town on fire. At fam'd Newmarket oft I spend the day, An unconcern'd spectator of the play; There pitiless observe the ruin'd heir With anger fir'd, or melting with despair: For how should I his trivial loss bemoan, Who feel one, so much greater, of my own? There while the golden heaps, a glorious prize, Wait the decision of two rival dice, While long disputes 'twixt seven and five remain, And each, like parties, have their friends for gain, Without one wish I see the guineas shine, Fate, keep your gold, I cry, make Chloe mine. Now see, prepar'd their utmost speed to try, O'er the smooth turf the bounding racers fly! Now more and more their slender limbs they strain, And foaming stretch along the velvet plain! Ah stay! swift steeds, your rapid flight delay, No more the jockey's smarting lash obey: But rather let my hand direct the rein, And guide your steps a nobler prize to gain; Then swift as eagles cut the yielding air, Bear me, oh bear me to the absent fair. Now when the winds are hush'd, the air serene, And chearful sun-beams gild the beauteous scene, Pensive o'er all the neighb'ring fields I stray, Where-e'er or choice, or chance directs the way; Or view the op'ning lawns, or private woods, Or distant bluish hills, or silver floods: Now harmless birds in silken nets insnare, Now with swift dogs pursue the flying hare; Dull sports! for oh my Chloe is not there! Fatigued at length I willingly retire To a small study, and a chearful fire, There o'er some folio pore; I pore, 'tis true, But oh my thoughts are fled, and fled to you; I hear you, see you, feast upon your eyes, And clasp with eager arms the lovely prize. Here for a while I cou'd forget my pain, Whilst I by dear reflection live again; But ev'n these joys are too sublime to last, And quickly fade, like all the real ones past: For just when now beneath some silent grove I hear you talk—and talk perhaps of love, Or charm with thrilling notes the list'ning ear, Sweeter than angels sing, or angels hear, My treach'rous hand its weighty charge lets go, The book falls thund'ring on the floor below, The pleasing vision in a moment's gone, And I once more am wretched and alone. So when glad Orpheus from th'infernal shade Had just recall'd his long-lamented maid, Soon as her charms had reach'd his eager eyes, Lost in eternal night—again she dies. To the Right Hon. the Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley, presented with a Collection of Poems. By the Same. The tuneful throng was ever beauty's care, And verse a tribute sacred to the fair, Hence in each age the loveliest nymph has been, By undisputed right, the Muses' queen? Her smiles have all poetick bosoms fir'd, And patroniz'd the verse themselves inspir'd: Lesbia presided thus in Roman times, Thus Sacharissa reign'd o'er British rhymes, And present bards to Margaretta bow, For, what they were of old, is Harley now. From Oxford's house, in these dull busy days, Alone we hope for patronage, or praise; He to our slighted labours still is kind, Beneath his roof w' are ever sure to find (Reward sufficient for the world's neglect) Charms to inspire, and goodness to protect; Your eyes with rapture animate our lays, Your sire's kind hand uprears our drooping bays, Form'd for our glory and support, ye seem, Our constant patron he, and you our theme. Where shou'd poetick homage then be pay'd? Where ev'ry verse, but at your feet be lay'd? A double right you to this empire bear, As first in beauty, and as Oxford's heir. Illustrious maid! in whose sole person join'd Ev'ry perfection of the fair we find, Charms that might warrant all her sex's pride, Without one foible of her sex to hide; Good-nature, artless as the bloom that dies Her cheeks, and wit as piercing as her eyes. Oh Harley! cou'd but you these lines approve, These children sprung from idleness, and love, Cou'd they (but ah how vain is the design!) Hope to amuse your hours, as once they've mine, Th'ill-judging world's applause, and critick's blame Alike I'd scorn; your approbation's fame. CHLOE to STREPHON. A SONG. By the Same. Too plain, dear youth, these tell-tale eyes My heart your own declare, But for heav'n's sake let it suffice You reign triumphant there: Forbear your utmost pow'r to try, Nor farther urge your sway; Press not for what I must deny, For fear I shou'd obey. Cou'd all your art successful prove, Wou'd you a maid undo, Whose greatest failing is her love, And that her love for you? Say, wou'd you use that very pow'r You from her fondness claim, To ruin in one fatal hour A life of spotless fame? Ah! cease, my dear, to do an ill, Because perhaps you may! But rather try your utmost skill To save me than betray: Be you yourself my virtue's guard, Defend, and not pursue; Since 'tis a task for me too hard, To fight with love and you. To the Right Honourable the Earl of CHESTERFIELD, on his being installed Knight of the Garter. By the Same. These trophies, Stanhope, of the lovely dame, Once the bright object of a monarch's flame, Who with such just propriety can wear, As thou, the darling of the gay and fair? See ev'ry friend to wit, politeness, love, With one consent thy sovereign's choice approve! And liv'd Plantagenet her voice to join, Herself, and Garter, both were surely thine. To a LADY, sent with a Present of Shells and Stones design'd for a Grotto. By the Same. With gifts like these, the spoils of neighb'ring shores, The Indian swain his sable love adores, Off'rings well suited to the dusky shrine Of his rude goddess, but unworthy mine: And yet they seem not such a worthless prize, If nicely view'd by philosophick eyes: And such are yours, that nature's works admire With warmth like that, which they themselves inspire. To such how fair appears each grain of sand, Or humblest weed, as wrought by nature's hand! How far superior to all human pow'r Springs the green blade, or buds the painted flow'r! In all her births, tho' of the meanest kinds, A just observer entertainment finds, With fond delight her low production sees, And how she gently rises by degrees; A shell, or stone he can with pleasure view, Hence trace her noblest works, the heav'ns—and you. Behold how bright these gaudy trifles shine, The lovely sportings of a hand divine! See with what art each curious shell is made, Here carv'd in fret-work, there with pearl inlaid! What vivid streaks th'enamel'd stones adorn, Fair as the paintings of the purple morn! Yet still not half their charms can reach our eyes, While thus confus'd the sparkling Chaos lies; Doubly they'll please, when in your Grotto plac'd, They plainly speak the fair disposer's taste; Then glories yet unseen shall o'er them rise, New order from your hand, new lustre from your eyes. How sweet, how charming will appear this Grot, When by your art to full perfection brought! Here verdant plants, and blooming flow'rs will grow, There bubbling currents through the shell-work flow; Here coral mix'd with shells of various dies, There polish'd stone will charm our wond'ring eyes; Delightful bow'r of bliss! secure retreat! Fit for the Muses, and Statira's seat. But still how good must be that fair-one's mind, Who thus in solitude can pleasure find! The Muse her company, good-sense her guide, Resistless charms her pow'r, but not her pride; Who thus forsakes the town, the park, and play, In silent shades to pass her hours away; Who better likes to breathe fresh country air, Than ride imprison'd in a velvet chair, And makes the warbling nightingale her choice, Before the thrills of Farinelli's voice; Prefers her books, and conscience void of ill, To consorts, balls, assemblies, and quadrille: Sweet bow'rs more pleas'd, than gilded chariots sees, For groves the play-house quits, and beaus for trees. Blest is the man, whom heav'n shall grant one hour With such a lovely nymph, in such a lovely bow'r. To a LADY, in answer to a Letter wrote in a very fine Hand. By the Same. Whilst well-wrote lines our wond'ring eyes command, The beauteous work of Chloe's artful hand, Throughout the finish'd piece we see display'd Th'exactest image of the lovely maid; Such is her wit, and such her form divine, This pure, as flows the style thro' ev'ry line, That, like each letter, exquisitely fine. See with what art the sable currents stain In wand'ring mazes all the milk-white plain! Thus o'er the meadows wrap'd in silver snow Unfrozen brooks in dark meanders flow; Thus jetty curls in shining ringlets deck The ivory plain of lovely Chloe's neck: See, like some virgin, whose unmeaning charms Receive new lustre from a lover's arms, The yielding paper's pure, but vacant breast, By her fair hand and flowing pen impress'd, At ev'ry touch more animated grows, And with new life and new ideas glows; Fresh beauties from the kind defiler gains, And shines each moment brighter from its stains. Let mighty love no longer boast his darts, That strike unerring, aim'd at mortal hearts; Chloe, your quill can equal wonders do, Wound full as sure, and at a distance too: Arm'd with your feather'd weapons in your hands, From pole to pole you send your great commands; To distant climes in vain the lover flies, Your pen o'ertakes him, if he 'scapes your eyes; So those, who from the sword in battle run, But perish victims to the distant gun. Beauty's a short-liv'd blaze, a fading flow'r, But there are charms no ages can devour; These, far superior to the brightest face; Triumph alike o'er time, as well as space, When that fair form, which thousands now adore, By years decay'd, shall tyrannize no more, These lovely lines shall future ages view, And eyes unborn, like ours, be charm'd by you. How oft do I admire with fond delight The curious piece, and wish like you to write! Alas, vain hope! that might as well aspire To copy Paulo's stroke, or Titian's fire: Ev'n now your splendid lines before me lie, And I in vain to imitate them try; Believe me, fair, I'm practising this art, To steal your hand, in hopes to steal your heart. The Art of DANCING. A Poem. Inscribed to the Rt. Hon. the Lady Fanny Fielding. Written in the Year 1730. By the Same. Incessu patuit Dea. Virg. CANTO I. In the smooth dance to move with graceful mien, Easy with care, and sprightly tho' serene, To mark th'instructions echoing strains convey, And with just steps each tuneful note obey, I teach; be present, all ye sacred Choir, Blow the soft flute, and strike the sounding lyre; When Fielding bids your kind assistance bring, And at her feet the lowly tribute fling; Oh may her eyes (to her this verse is due) What first themselves inspir'd, vouchsafe to view! Hail loftiest art! thou can'st all hearts insnare, And make the fairest still appear more fair. Beauty can little execution do, Unless she borrows half her arms from you! Few, like Pygmalion, doat on lifeless charms, Or care to clasp a statue in their arms; But breast of flint must melt with fierce desire, When art and motion wake the sleeping fire: A Venus, drawn by great Apelles' hand, May for awhile our wond'ring eyes command, But still, tho' form'd with all the pow'rs of art, The lifeless piece can never warm the heart; So fair a nymph, perhaps, may please the eye, Whilst all her beauteous limbs unactive lie, But when her charms are in the dance display'd, Then ev'ry heart adores the lovely maid: This sets her beauty in the fairest light, And shews each grace in full perfection bright; Then, as she turns around, from every part, Like porcupines she sends a piercing dart; In vain, alas! the fond spectator tries To shun the pleasing dangers of her eyes, For Parthian-like, she wounds as sure behind, With flowing curls, and ivory neck reclin'd: Whether her steps the Minuet's mazes trace, Or the slow Louvre's more majestick pace, Whether the Rigadoon employs her care, Or sprightly Jigg displays the nimble fair, At every step new beauties we explore, And worship now, what we admir'd before: So when Æneas, in the Tyrian grove, Fair Venus met, the charming queen of Love, The beauteous goddess, whilst unmov'd she stood, Seem'd some fair nymph, the guardian of the wood; But when she mov'd, at once her heav'nly mien And graceful step confess'd bright Beauty's queen, New glories o'er her form each moment rise, And all the Goddess opens to his eyes. Now haste, my Muse, pursue thy destin'd way, What dresses best become the dancer, say; The rules of dress forget not to impart, A lesson previous to the dancing art. The soldiers scarlet glowing from afar, Shews that his bloody occupation's war; Whilst the lawn band, beneath a double chin, As plainly speaks divinity within; The milk-maid safe thro' driving rains and snows, Wrapt in her cloak, and prop'd on pattens goes; Whilst the soft Belle, immur'd in velvet chair, Needs but the silken shoe, and trusts her bosom bare: The woolly drab, and English broad-cloth warm, Guard well the horseman from the beating storm, But load the dancer with too great a weight, And call from ev'ry pore the dewy sweat; Rather let him his active limbs display In camblet thin, or glossy paduasoy. Let no unwieldy pride his shoulders press; But airy, light, and easy be his dress; Thin be his yielding soal, and low his heel, So shall he nimbly bound, and safely wheel. But let not precepts known my verse prolong, Precepts which use will better teach, than song; For why should I the gallant spark command, With clean white gloves to fit his ready hand? Or in his sob enlivening spirits wear, And pungent salts to raise the fainting fair? Or hint, the sword that dangles at his side, Should from its silken bandage be unty'd? Why should my lays the youthful tribe advise, Lest snowy clouds from out their wigs arise; So shall their partners mourn their laces spoil'd, And shining silks with greasy powder soil'd? Nor need I, sure, bid prudent youths beware, Lest with erected tongues their buckles stare, The pointed steel shall oft' their stocking rend, And oft' th'approaching petticoat offend. And now, ye youthful fair, I sing to you, With pleasing smiles my useful labours view: For you the silkworms fine-wrought webs display, And lab'ring spin their little lives away, For you bright gems with radiant colours glow, Fair as the dies that paint the heav'nly bow, For you the sea resigns its pearly store, And earth unlocks her mines of treasur'd ore; In vain yet Nature thus her gifts bestows, Unless yourselves with art those gifts dispose. Yet think not, Nymphs, that in the glitt'ring ball, One form of dress prescrib'd can suit with all; One brightest shines when wealth and art combine To make the finish'd piece compleatly fine; When least adorn'd, another steals our hearts, And rich in native beauties, wants no arts: In some are such resistless graces found, That in all dresses they are sure to wound; Their perfect forms all foreign aids despise, And gems but borrow lustre from their eyes. Let the fair Nymph, in whose plump cheeks is seen A constant blush, be clad in chearful green; In such a dress the sportive sea-nymphs go; So in their grassy bed fresh roses blow: The lass whose skin is like the hazel brown, With brighter yellow should o'ercome her own: While maids grown pale with sickness or despair, The fable's mournful dye should choose to wear; So the pale moon still shines with purest light, Cloath'd in the dusky mantle of the night. But far from you be all those treach'rous arts, That wound with painted charms unwary hearts, Dancing's a touchstone that true beauty tries, Nor suffers charms that Nature's hand denies: Tho' for awhile we may with wonder view The rosy blush, and skin of lovely hue, Yet soon the dance will cause the cheeks to glow, And melt the waxen lips, and neck of snow: So shine the fields in icy fetters bound, Whilst frozen gems bespangle all the ground, Thro' the clear crystal of the glitt'ring snow, With scarlet dye the blushing hawthorns glow; O'er all the plains unnumber'd glories rise, And a new bright creation charms our eyes: Till Zeyhyr breathes, then all at once decay The splendid scenes, their glories fade away, The fields resign the beauties not their own, And all their snowy charms run trickling down. Dare I in such momentous points advise, I should condemn the hoop's enormous size, Of ills I speak by long experience found, Oft' have I trod th'immeasurable round, And mourn'd my shins bruis'd black with many a wound. Nor shou'd the tighten'd stays, too straitly lac'd, In whale-bone bondage gall the slender waist; Nor waving lappets shou'd the dancing fair, Nor ruffles edg'd with dangling fringes wear; Oft' will the cobweb ornaments catch hold On the approaching button rough with gold, Nor force, nor art can then the bonds divide, When once th'intangled Gordian knot is ty'd: So the unhappy pair, by Hymen's pow'r, Together join'd in some ill-fated hour, The more they strive their freedom to regain, The faster binds th'indissoluble chain. Let each fair maid, who fears to be disgrac'd, Ever be sure to tye her garter fast, Lest the loos'd string, amidst the public ball, A wish'd for prize to some proud fop should fall, Who the rich treasure shall triumphant shew, And with warm blushes cause her cheeks to glow. But yet, (as Fortune by the self-same ways She humbles many, some delights to raise) It happen'd once, a fair illustrious dame By such neglect acquir'd immortal fame. And hence the radiant Star and Garter blue Britannia's nobles grace, if Fame says true: Hence still, Plantagenet, thy beauties bloom, Tho' long since moulder'd in the dusky tomb, Still thy lost Garter is thy sov'reign's care, And what each royal breast is proud to wear. But let me now my lovely charge remind, Lest they forgetful leave their fans behind; Lay not, ye fear, the pretty toy aside, A toy at once display'd, for use and pride, A wond'rous engine, that by magick charms, Cools your own breast, and ev'ry other's warms. What daring bard shall e'er attempt to tell The pow'rs, that in this little weapon dwell? What verse can e'er explain its various parts, Its numerous uses, motions, charms and arts? Its painted folds, that oft extended wide, Th'afflicted fair one's blubber'd beauties hide, When secret sorrows her sad bosom fill, If Strephon is unkind, or Shock is ill: Its sticks, on which her eyes dejected pore, And pointing fingers number o'er and o'er, When the kind virgin burns with secret shame, Dies to consent, yet fears to own her flame; Its shake triumphant, its victorious clap, Its angry flutter, and its wanton tap? Forbear, my Muse, th'extensive theme to sing, Nor trust in such a flight thy tender wing; Rather do you in humble lines proclaim, From whence this engine took its form and name, Say from what cause it first deriv'd its birth, How form'd in heav'n, how thence deduc'd to earth. Once in Arcadia, that fam'd seat of love, There liv'd a nymph, the pride of all the grove, A lovely nymph, adorn'd with ev'ry grace, An easy shape, and sweetly blooming face, Fanny the damsel's name, as chaste as fair, Each virgin's envy, and each swain's despair; To charm her ear the rival shepherds sing, Blow the soft flute, and wake the trembling string, For her they leave their wand'ring flocks to rove, Whilst Fanny's name resounds thro' ev'ry grove, And spreads on every tree, inclos'd in knots of love; As Fielding's now, her eyes all hearts inflame, Like her in beauty, as alike in name. 'Twas when the summer sun, now mounted high, With fiercer beams had scorch'd the glowing sky, Beneath the covert of a cooling shade, To shun the heat, this lovely nymph was lay'd; The sultry weather o'er her cheeks had spread A blush, that added to their native red, And her fair breasts, as polish'd marble white, Were half conceal'd, and half expos'd to sight; Æolus the mighty God, whom winds obey, Observ'd the beauteous maid, as thus she lay, O'er all her charms he gaz'd with fond delight, And suck'd in poison at the dangerous sight; He sighs, he burns; at last declares his pain, But still he sighs, and still he wooes in vain; The cruel nymph, regardless of his moan, Minds not his flame, uneasy with her own; But still complains, that he who rul'd the air Would not command one Zephyr to repair Around her face, nor gentle breeze to play Thro' the dark glade, to cool the sultry day; By love incited, and the hopes of joy, Th'ingenious God contriv'd this pretty toy, With gales incessant to relieve her flame; And call'd it Fan, from lovely Fanny's name. CANTO II. Now see prepar'd to lead the sprightly dance, The lovely nymphs, and well-dress'd youths advance; The spacious room receives each jovial guest, And the floor shakes with pleasing weight oppress'd: Thick rang'd on every side, with various dyes The fair in glossy silks our sight surprize: So, in a garden bath'd with genial show'rs, A thousand sorts of variegated flow'rs, Jonquils, carnations, pinks, and tulips rise, And in a gay confusion charm our eyes. High o'er their heads, with num'rous candles bright, Large sconces shed their sparkling beams of light, Their sparkling beams that still more brightly glow, Reflected back from gems, and eyes below: Unnumber'd fans to cool the crowded fair With breathing Zephyrs move the circling air, The sprightly fiddle, and the sounding lyre Each youthful breast with gen'rous warmth inspire; Fraught with all joys the blissful moments fly, While music melts the ear, and beauty charms the eye. Now let the youth, to whose superior place It first belongs the splendid ball to grace, With humble bow, and ready hand prepare, Forth from the crowd to lead his chosen fair; The fair shall not his kind request deny, But to the pleasing toil with equal ardour fly. But stay, rash pair, not yet untaught advance, First hear the Muse, ere you attempt to dance: Arte citæ veloque rates remoque moventur, Arte leves currus. Ovid.By art directed o'er the foaming tide Secure from rocks the painted vessels glide; By art the chariot scours the dusty plain, Springs at the whip, and ? Nec audit currus habenas. Virg. hears the strait'ning rein: To art our bodies must obedient prove, If e'er we hope with graceful ease to move. Long was the dancing art unfix'd, and free, Hence lost in error and uncertainty, No precepts did in mind, or rules obey, But every master taught a diff'rent way; Hence ere each new-born dance was fully try'd, The lovely product ev'n in blooming dy'd, Thro' various hands in wild confusion toss'd, Its steps were alter'd, and its beauties lost; Till Fuillet wrote the Art of Dancing by characters in French, since translated by Weaver. Fuillet, the pride of Gallia, rose, And did the dance in characters compose, Each lovely grace by certain marks he taught, And every step in lasting volumes wrote: Hence o'er the world this pleasing art shall spread, And every dance in ev'ry clime be read. By distant masters shall each step be seen, Tho' mountains rise, and oceans roar between; Hence, with her sister arts, shall Dancing claim An equal right to universal fame, And Isaac's rigadoon shall live as long, As Raphael's painting, or as Virgil's song. Wise Nature ever, with a prudent hand, Dispenses various gifts to every land, To every nation frugally imparts A genius fit for some peculiar arts; To trade the Dutch incline, the Swiss to arms, Music and verse are soft Italia's charms; Britannia justly glories to have found Lands unexplor'd, and sail'd the globe around: But none will sure presume to rival France, Whether she forms, or executes the dance; To her exalted genius 'tis we owe The sprightly Rigadoon and Louvre slow, The Borée, and Courant unpractis'd long, Th'immortal Minuet, and the smooth Bretagne, With all those dances of illustrious fame, French dances.That from their native country take their name, With these let every ball be first begun, Nor country dance intrude till these are done. Each cautious bard, ere he attempts to sing, First gently flutt'ring tries his tender wing, And if he finds that with uncommon fire The Muses all his raptur'd soul inspire, At once to heav'n he soars in lofty odes, And sings alone of heroes and of gods; But if he trembling fears a flight so high, He then descends to softer elegy; And if in elegy he can't succeed, In past'ral he may tune the oaten reed: So should the dancer, ere he tries to move, With care his strength, his weight, and genius prove; Then, if he finds kind Nature's gifts impart Endowments proper for the dancing art, If in himself he feels together join'd, An active body and ambitious mind, In nimble Rigadoons he may advance, Or in the Louvre's slow majestic dance; If these he fears to reach, with easy pace Let him the Minuet's circling mazes trace: Is this too hard? this too let him forbear, And to the Country-dance confine his care. Wou'd you in dancing ev'ry fault avoid, To keep true time be your first thoughts employ'd; All other errors they in vain shall mend, Who in this one important point offend; For this, when now united hand in hand Eager to start the youthful couple stand; Let them awhile their nimble feet restrain, And with soft taps beat time to ev'ry strain: So for the race prepar'd two coursers stand, And with impatient pawings spurn the sand. In vain a master shall employ his care, Where Nature once has fix'd a clumsy air; Rather let such, to country sports confin'd, Pursue the flying hare, or tim'rous hind: Nor yet, while I the rural 'squire despise, A mien effeminate would I advise; With equal scorn I would the fop deride, Nor let him dance—but on the woman's side. And you, fair nymphs, avoid with equal care, A stupid dulness, and a coquet air; Neither with eyes, that ever love the ground, Asleep, like spinning-tops, run round and round; Nor yet with giddy looks, and wanton pride, Stare all around, and skip from side to side. True dancing, like true wit, is best express'd By nature only to advantage dress'd; 'Tis not a nimble bound, or caper high, That can pretend to please a curious eye, Good judges no such tumblers tricks regard, Or think them beautiful, because they're hard. 'Tis not enough, that every stander-by No glaring errors in your steps can spy, The dance and music must so nicely meet, Each note should seem an echo to your feet; A nameless grace must in each movement dwell, Which words can ne'er express, or precepts tell, Not to be taught, but ever to be seen In Flavia's air, and Chloe's easy mien: 'Tis such an air that makes her thousands fall, When Fielding dances at a birth-night ball; Smooth as Camilla she skims o'er the plain, And flies like her thro' crowds of heroes slain. Now when the Minuet oft repeated o'er, (Like all terrestrial joys) can please no more, And ev'ry nymph, refusing to expand Her charms, declines the circulating hand; Then let the jovial country-dance begin, And the loud fiddles call each straggler in: But ere they come, permit me to disclose, How first, as legends tell, this pastime rose. In ancient times (such times are now no more) When Albion's crown illustrious Arthur wore, In some fair op'ning glade, each summer's night, Where the pule moon diffus'd her silver light, On the soft carpet of a grassy field, The sporting fairies their assemblies held: Some lightly tripping with their pigmy queen, In circling ringlets mark'd the level green, Some with soft notes bade mellow pipes resound, And music warble thro' the groves around; Oft' lonely shepherds by the forest side, Belated peasants oft' their revels spy'd, And home returning, o'er the nut-brown ale, Their guests diverted with the wond'rous tale Instructed hence, throughout the British isle, And fond to imitate the pleasing toil, Round where the trembling may-pole's fix'd on high, And bears its flow'ry honours to the sky, The ruddy maids, and sun-burnt swains resort, And practise every night the lovely sport; On every side Æolian artists stand, Whose active elbows swelling winds command, The swelling winds harmonious pipes inspire, And blow in ev'ry breast a generous fire. Thus taught at first the country-dance began, And hence to cities and to courts it ran, Succeeding ages did in time impart Various improvements to the lovely art: From fields and groves to palaces remov'd; Great ones the pleasing exercise approv'd; Hence the loud fiddle, and shrill trumpet's sounds, Are made companions of the dancer's bounds; Hence gems, and silks, brocades, and ribbons join, To make the ball with perfect lustre shine. So rude at first the tragic Muse appear'd, Her voice alone by rustic rabble heard, Where twisting trees a cooling arbour made The pleas'd spectators sat beneath the shade, The homely stage with rushes green was strew'd, And in a cart the strolling actors rode: Till time at length improv'd the great design, And bade the scenes with painted landskips shine; Then art did all the bright machines dispose, And theatres of Parian marble rose, Then mimic thunder shook the canvas sky, And Gods descended from their tow'rs on high. With caution now let every youth prepare To choose a partner from the mingled fair; Vain would he hear th'instructed Muse's voice, If she pretended to direct his choice: Beauty alone by fancy is express'd, And charms in different forms each different breast; A snowy skin this am'rous youth admires, Whilst nut-brown cheeks another's bosom fires. Small waists and slender limbs some hearts ensnare, While others love the more substantial fair. But let not outward charms your judgments sway, Your reason rather than your eyes obey, And in the dance, as in the marriage noose, Rather for merit, than for beauty, choose: Be her your choice, who knows with perfect skill When she should move, and when she should be still, Who uninstructed can perform her share, And kindly half the pleasing burthen bear. Unhappy is that hopeless wretch's fate, Who fetter'd in the matrimonial state With a poor, simple, unexperienc'd wife, Is forc'd to lead the tedious dance of life; And such is his, with such a partner join'd, A moving puppet, but without a mind: Still must his hand be pointing out the way, Yet ne'er can teach so fast, as she can stray, Beneath her follies he must ever groan, And ever blush for errors not his own. But now behold united hand in hand, Rang'd on each side, the well-pair'd couples stand! Each youthful bosom beating with delight, Waits the brisk signal for the pleasing fight: While lovely eyes, that flash unusual rays, And snowy bubbies pull'd above the stays, Quick busy hands, and bridling heads declare, The fond impatience of the starting fair. And see the sprightly dance is now begun! Now here, now there the giddy maze they run, Now with slow steps they pace the circling ring, Now all confus'd, too swift for sight they spring: So, in a wheel with rapid fury toss'd, The undistinguish'd spokes are in the motion lost. The dancer here no more requires a guide, To no strict steps his nimble feet are ty'd, The Muse's precepts here wou'd useless be, Where all is fancy'd, unconfin'd, and free; Let him but to the musick's voice attend, By this instructed, he can ne'er offend; If to his share it falls the dance to lead, In well-known paths he may be sure to tread; If others lead, let him their motions view, And in their steps the winding maze pursue. In every Country-dance a serious mind, Turn'd for reflection, can a moral find; In Hunt-the-Squirrel thus the nymph we view, Seeks when we fly, but flies when we pursue: Thus in Round-dances, where our partners change, And unconfin'd from fair to fair we range, As soon as one from his own consort flies, Another seizes on the lovely prize: Awhile the fav'rite youth enjoys her charms, Till the next comer steals her from his arms, New ones succeed, the last is still her care; How true an emblem of th'inconstant fair! Where can philosophers, and sages wise, Who read the curious volumes of the skies, A model more exact than dancing name, Of the creation's universal frame? Where worlds unnumber'd o'er th'ætherial way, In a bright regular confusion stray; Now here, now there they whirl along the sky, Now near approach, and now far distant fly, Now meet in the same order they began, And then the great celestial dance is done. Where can the mor'list find a juster plan Of the vain labours, and the life of man? Awhile thro' justling crowds we toil, and sweat, And eagerly pursue we know not what, Then when our trifling short-liv'd race is run, Quite tir'd sit down, just where we first begun. Tho' to your arms kind fate's indulgent care Has giv'n a partner exquisitely fair, Let not her charms so much engage your heart, That you neglect the skilful dancer's part; Be not, when you the tuneful notes should hear, Still whisp'ring idle prattle in her ear; When you should be employ'd, be not at play, Nor for your joys all others steps delay: But when the finish'd dance you once have done, And with applause thro' ev'ry couple run, There rest awhile: there snatch the fleeting bliss, The tender whisper, and the balmy kiss; Each secret wish, each softer hope confess, And her moist palm with eager fingers press; With smiles the fair shall hear your warm desires, When musick melts her soul, and dancing sires. Thus mix'd with love, the pleasing toil pursue, Till the unwelcome morn appears in view; Then, when approaching day its beams displays, And the dull candles shine with fainter rays, Then when the sun just rises o'er the deep, And each bright eye is almost set in sleep, With ready hands, obsequious youths, prepare Safe to her coach to lead each chosen fair, And guard her from the morn's inclement air: Let a warm hood enwrap her lovely head, And o'er her neck a handkerchief be spread, Around her shoulders let this arm be cast, Whilst that from cold defends her slender waist; With kisses warm her balmy lips shall glow, Unchill'd by nightly damps, or wintry snow; While gen'rous white-wine, mull'd with ginger warm, Safely protects her inward frame from harm. But ever let my lovely pupils fear To chill their mantling blood with cold small beer; Ah, thoughtless fair! the tempting draught refuse, When thus forewarn'd by my experienc'd Muse; Let the sad consequence your thoughts employ, Nor hazard future pains, for present joy, Destruction lurks within the pois'nous dose, A fatal fever, or a pimpled nose. Thus thro' each precept of the dancing art The Muse has play'd the kind instructor's part, Thro' every maze her pupils she has led, And pointed out the surest paths to tread; No more remains; no more the goddess sings, But drops her pinions, and unfurls her wings; On downy beds the weary dancers lie, And sleep's silk cords tie down each drowsy eye; Delightful dreams their pleasing sports restore, And ev'n in sleep they seem to dance once more. And now the work completely finish'd lies, Which the devouring teeth of time defies; Whilst birds in air, or fish in streams we find, Or damsels fret with aged partners join'd; As long as nymphs shall with attentive ear A fiddle rather than a sermon hear; So long the brighest eye shall oft peruse The useful lines of my instructive Muse; Each belle shall wear them wrote upon her fan, And each bright beau shall read them—if he can. THE MODERN FINE GENTLEMAN. Written in the Year 1746. By the Same. Quale portentum neque militaris Daunia in latis alit esculetis, Nec Jubæ tellus generat, leonum Arida nutrix. Just broke from school, pert, impudent, and raw; Expert in Latin, more expert in taw, His honour posts o'er Italy and France, Measures St. Peter's dome, and learns to dance. Thence having quick thro' various countries flown, Glean'd all their follies, and expos'd his own, He back returns, a thing so strange all o'er, As never ages past produc'd before: A monster of such complicated worth, As no one single clime could e'er bring forth: Half atheist, papist, gamester, bubble, rook, Half fidler, coachman, dancer, groom, and cook. Next, because bus'ness now is all the vogue, And who'd be quite polite must be a rogue, In parliament he purchases a seat, To make th'accomplish'd Gentleman compleat. There safe in self-sufficient impudence, Without experience, honesty, or sense, Unknowing in her int'rest, trade, or laws, He vainly undertakes his country's cause: Forth from his lips, prepar'd at all to rail, Torrents of nonsense burst; like bottled ale, Tho' shallow, muddy; brisk, tho' mighty dull; Fierce without strength; o'erflowing, tho' not full. Now quite a Frenchman in his garb and air, His neck yok'd down with bag and solitaire, The liberty of Britain he supports, And storms at place-men, ministers, and courts; Now in crop'd greasy hair, and leather breeches, He loudly bellows out his patriot speeches; King, lords, and commons ventures to abuse, Yet dares to shew those ears he ought to lose. From hence to White's our virtuous Cato flies, There sits with countenance erect, and wise, And talks of games of whist, and pig-tail pies; Plays all the night, nor doubts each law to break, Himself unknowingly has help'd to make; Trembling and anxious, stakes his utmost groat, Peeps o'er his cards, and looks as if he thought: Next morn disowns the losses of the night, Because the fool would fain be thought a bite. Devoted thus to politicks, and cards, Nor mirth, nor wine, nor women he regards; So far is ev'ry virtue from his heart, That not a gen'rous vice can claim a part; Nay, lest one human passion e'er should move His soul to friendship, tenderness, or love, To Figg and Broughton he commits his breast, To steel it to the fashionable test. Thus poor in wealth, he labours to no end, Wretched alone, in crowds without a friend; Insensible to all that's good, or kind, Deaf to all merit, to all beauty blind; For love too busy, and for wit too grave, A harden'd, sober, proud, luxurious knave, By little actions striving to be great, And proud to be, and to be thought a cheat. And yet in this so bad is his success, That as his fame improves, his rents grow less; On parchment wings his acres take their flight, And his unpeopled groves admit the light; With his estate his interest too is done, His honest borough seeks a warmer sun. For him, now cash and liquor flows no more, His independent voters cease to roar: And Britain soon must want the great defence Of all his honesty, and eloquence, But that the gen'rous youth more anxious grown For public liberty, than for his own, Marries some jointur'd antiquated crone: And boldly, when his country is at stake, Braves the deep yawning gulph, like Curtius, for its sake. Quickly again distress'd for want of coin, He digs no longer in th'exhausted mine, But seeks preferment, as the last resort, Cringes each morn at levées, bows at court, And, from the hand he hates, implores support: The minister, well pleas'd at small expence To silence so much rude impertinence, With squeeze and whisper yields to his demands, And on the venal list enroll'd he stands; A ribband and a pension buy the slave, This bribes the fool about him, that the knave. And now arriv'd at his meridian glory, He sinks apace, despis'd by Whig and Tory; Of independence now he talks no more, Nor shakes the senate with his patriot roar; But silent votes, and with court trappings hung, Eyes his own glitt'ring star, and holds his tongue. In craft political a bankrupt made, He sticks to gaming, as the surer trade; Turns downright sharper, lives by sucking blood, And grows, in short, the very thing he wou'd: Hunts out young heirs, who have their fortunes spent, And lends them ready cash at cent per cent, Lays wagers on his own, and others lives, Fights uncles, fathers, grandmothers and wives, Till death at length, indignant to be made The daily subject of his sport and trade, Veils with his sable hand the wretch's eyes, And, groaning for the betts he loses by't, he dies. THE MODERN FINE LADY. ? Miseri quibus Intentata nites. Hor. Skill'd in each art, that can adorn the fair, The spritely dance, the soft Italian air, The toss of quality, and high-bred fleer, Now lady Harriot reach'd her fifteenth year. Wing'd with diversions all her moments flew, Each, as it pass'd, presenting something new; Breakfasts and auctions wear the morn away, Each evening gives an opera, or a play; Then Brag's eternal joys all night remain, And kindly usher in the morn again. For love no time has she, or inclination, Yet must coquet it for the sake of fashion; For this she listens to each fop that's near, Th'embroider'd colonel flatters with a sneer, And the cropt ensign nuzzles in her ear. But with most warmth her dress and airs inspire Th'ambitious bosom of the landed 'squire, Who fain would quit plump Dolly's softer charms, For wither'd lean right honourable arms; He bows with reverence at her sacred shrine, And treats her as if sprung from race divine, Which she returns with insolence and scorn, Nor deigns to smile on a plebeian born. Ere long by friends, by cards, and lovers cross'd, Her fortune, health, and reputation lost; Her money gone, yet not a tradesman paid, Her fame, yet she still damn'd to be a maid, Her spirits sink, her nerves are so unstrung, She weeps, if but a handsome thief is hung: By mercers, lacemen, mantua-makers press'd, But most for ready cash for play distress'd, Where can she turn?—the 'squire must all repair, She condescends to listen to his pray'r, And marries him at length in mere despair. But soon th'endearments of a husband cloy, Her soul, her frame incapable of joy: She feels no transports in the bridal bed, Of which so oft sh' has heard, so much has read; Then vex'd, that she should be condemn'd alone To seek in vain this philosophick stone, To abler tutors she resolves t'apply, A prostitute from curiosity: Hence men of ev'ry sort, and ev'ry size, Impatient for heav'n's cordial drop, she tries; The fribbling beau, the rough unwieldy clown, The ruddy templar newly on the town, Th'Hibernian captain of gigantic make, The brimful parson, and th'exhausted rake. But still malignant Fate her wish denies, Cards yield superior joys, to cards she flies; All night from rout to rout her chairmen run, Again she plays, and is again undone. Behold her now in Ruin's frightful jaws! Bonds, judgments, executions, ope their paws; Seize jewels, furniture, and plate, nor spare The gilded chariot, or the tossel'd chair, For lonely seat she's forc'd to quit the town, And Tubbs conveys the wretched exile down. Now rumbling o'er the stones of Tyburn-road, Ne'er press'd with a more griev'd or guilty load, She bids adieu to all the well-known streets, And envies ev'ry cinder-wench she meets: And now the dreaded country first appears, With sighs unfeign'd the dying noise she hears Of distant coaches fainter by degrees, Then starts and trembles at the sight of trees. Silent and sullen, like some captive queen, She's drawn along, unwilling to be seen, Until at length appears the ruin'd hall Within the grass-green moat, and ivy'd wall, The doleful prison where for ever she, But not, alas! her griefs, must bury'd be. Her coach the curate and the tradesmen meet, Great-coated tenants her arrival greet, And boys with stubble bonfires light the street, While bells her ears with tongues discordant grate, Types of the nuptial tyes they celebrate: But no rejoicings can unbend her brow, Nor deigns she to return one aukward bow, But bounces in disdaining once to speak, And wipes the trickling tear from off her cheek. Now see her in the sad decline of life, A peevish mistress, and a sulky wife; Her nerves unbrac'd, her faded cheek grown pale With many a real, many a fancy'd ail; Of cards, admirers, equipage bereft; Her insolence, and title only left; Severely humbled to her one-horse chair, And the low pastimes of a country fair: Too wretched to endure one lonely day, Too proud one friendly visit to repay, Too indolent to read, too criminal to pray. At length half dead, half mad, and quite confin'd, Shunning, and shunn'd by all of human kind, Ev'n robb'd of the last comfort of her life, Insulting the poor curate's callous wife, Pride, disappointed pride, now stops her breath, And with true scorpion rage she stings herself to death. AN ESSAY on VIRTUE. To the Honourable PHILIP YORKE, Esq; By the Same. Atque ipsa utilitas justi prope mater et æqui. Hor. Thou, whom nor honours, wealth, nor youth can spoil With the least vice of each luxuriant soil, Say, Yorke, (for sure, if any, you can tell) What Virtue is, who practise it so well; Say, where inhabits this Sultana queen; Prais'd and ador'd by all, but rarely seen: By what sure marks her essence can we trace, When each religion, faction, age, and place Sets up some fancy'd idol of its own, A vain pretender to her sacred throne? In man, too oft a well-dissembled part, A self-denying pride in woman's heart, In synods faith, and in the fields of fame Valour usurps her honours, and her name. Whoe'er their sense of Virtue cou'd express, 'Tis still by something they themselves possess. Hence youth good-humour, frugal craft old age, Warm politicians term it party-rage; True churchmen zeal right orthodox; and hence Fools think it gravity, and wits pretence; To constancy alone fond lovers join it, And maids unask'd to chastity confine it. But have we then no law besides our will? No just criterion fix'd to good and ill? As well at noon we may obstruct our sight, Then doubt if such a thing exists as light; For no less plain wou'd nature's law appear, As the meridian sun unchang'd, and clear, Wou'd we but search for what we were design'd, And for what end th'Almighty form'd mankind, A rule of life we then should plainly see, For to pursue that end must Virtue be. Then what is that? not want of power, or fame, Or worlds unnumber'd to applaud his name, But a desire his blessings to diffuse, And fear lest millions should existence lose; His goodness only could his pow'r employ, And an eternal warmth to propagate his joy. Hence soul, and sense diffus'd thro' ev'ry place, Make happiness as infinite as space; Thousands of suns beyond each other blaze, Orbs roll o'er orbs, and glow with mutual rays; Each is a world, where form'd with wond'rous art, Unnumber'd species live thro' every part: In ev'ry tract of ocean, earth, and skies Myriads of creatures still successive rise; Scarce buds a leaf, or springs the vilest weed, But little flocks upon its verdure feed; No fruit our palate courts, or flow'r our smell, But on its fragrant bosom nations dwell, All form'd with proper faculties to share The daily bounties of their Maker's care; The great Creator from his heav'nly throne, Pleas'd, on the wide-expanded joy looks down, And his eternal law is only this, That all contribute to the general bliss. Nature so plain this primal law displays, Each living creature sees it, and obeys; Each, form'd for all, promotes thro' private care The publick good, and justly tastes its share. All understand their great Creator's will, Strive to be happy, and in that fulfill; Mankind excepted; lord of all beside, But only slave to folly, vice, and pride; 'Tis he that's deaf to this command alone, Deilghts in others' woe, and courts his own; Racks and destroys with tort'ring steel and flame, For lux'ry brutes, and man himself for fame: Sets Superstition high on Virtue's throne, Then thinks his Maker's temper like his own: Hence are his altars stain'd with reeking gore, As if he could atone for crimes by more: Hence whilst offended heav'n he strives in vain T'appease by fasts, and voluntary pain, Ev'n in repenting he provokes again. How easy is our yoke! how light our load! Did we not strive to mend the laws of God: For his own sake no duty he can ask, The common welfare is our only task; For this sole end his precepts, kind as just, Forbid intemp'rance, murder, theft, and lust, With ev'ry act injurious to our own Or others' good, for such are crimes alone: For this are peace, love, charity, enjoin'd, With all that can secure and bless mankind. Thus is the publick safety Virtue's cause, And happiness the end of all her laws; For such by nature is the human frame, Our duty and our int'rest are the same. But hold, cries out some Puritan divine, Whose well-stuff'd cheeks with ease and plenty shine, Is this to fast, to mortify, refrain, And work salvation out with fear and pain? We own, the rigid lessons of their schools Are widely diff'rent from these easy rules; Virtue, with them, is only to abstain From all that nature asks, and covet pain; Pleasure and vice are ever near a-kin, And, if we thirst, cold water is a sin: Heav'n's path is rough and intricate, they say, Yet all are damn'd that trip, or miss their way; God is a being cruel and severe, And man a wretch, by his command plac'd here, In sun-shine for awhile to take a turn, Only to dry and make him fit to burn. Mistaken men, too piously severe! Thro' craft misleading, or misled by fear; How little they God's counsels comprehend, Our universal parent, guardian, friend! Who, forming by degrees to bliss mankind, This globe our sportive nursery assign'd, Where for awhile his fond paternal care Feasts us with ev'ry joy our state can bear: Each sense, touch, taste, and smell dispense delight, Musick our hearing, beauty charms our sight; Trees, herbs, and flow'rs to us their spoils resign, Its pearl the rock presents, its gold the mine; Beasts, fowl, and fish their daily tribute give Of food and cloaths, and die that we may live: Seasons but change, new pleasures to produce, And elements contend to serve our use: Love's gentle shafts, ambition's tow'ring wings, The pomps of senates, churches, courts, and kings, All that our rev'rence, joy, or hope create, Are the gay play-things of this infant state. Scarcely an ill to human life belongs, But what our follies cause, or mutual wrongs; Or if some stripes from Providence we feel, He strikes with pity, and but wounds to heal; Kindly perhaps sometimes afflicts us here, To guide her views to a sublimer sphere, In more exalted joys to fix our taste, And wean us from delights that cannot last. Our present good the easy task is made, To earn superior bliss, when this shall fade; For, soon as e'er these moral pleasures cloy, His hand shall lead us to sublimer joy; Snatch us from all our little sorrows here, Calm every grief, and dry each childish tear; Waft us to regions of eternal peace, Where bliss and virtue grow with like increase; From strength to strength our souls for ever guide, Thro' wond'rous scenes of being yet untry'd, Where in each stage we shall more perfect grow, And new perfections, new delights bestow. Oh! would mankind but make these truths their guide, And force the helm from prejudice and pride, Were once these maxims fix'd, that God's our friend, Virtue our good, and happiness our end, How soon must reason o'er the world prevail, And error, fraud, and superstition fail! None wou'd hereafter then with groundless fear Describe th'Almighty cruel and severe, Predestinating some without pretence To heav'n, and some to hell for no offence; Inflicting endless pains for transient crimes, And fav'ring sects or nations, men or times. To please him, none would foolishly forbear Or food, or rest, or itch in shirts of hair, Or deem it merit to believe, or teach, What reason contradicts, or cannot reach; None wou'd fierce zeal for piety mistake, Or malice for whatever tenet's sake, Or think salvation to one sect confin'd, And heav'n too narrow to contain mankind. No more then nymphs, by long neglect grown nice, Wou'd in one female frailty sum up vice, And censure those, who, nearer to the right, Think Virtue is but to dispense delight. No servile tenets wou'd admittance find, Destructive of the rights of human-kind; Of pow'r divine, hereditary right, And non-resistance to a tyrant's might: For sure that all shou'd thus for one be curs'd, Is but great nature's edict just revers'd. No moralists then, righteous to excess, Wou'd show fair Virtue in so black a dress, That they, like boys, who some feign'd spright array, First from the spectre fly themselves away: No preachers in the terrible delight, But chuse to win by reason, not affright; Not conjurers like, in fire and brimstone dwell, And draw each moving argument from hell. No more our sage interpreters of laws, Wou'd fatten on obscurities, and flaws, But rather nobly careful of their trust, Strive to wipe off the long-contracted dust, And be, like Hardwicke, guardians of the just. No more applause wou'd on ambition wait, And laying waste the world be counted great, But one good-natur'd act more praises gain, Than armies overthrown, and thousands slain; No more wou'd brutal rage disturb our peace, But envy, hatred, war, and discord cease; Our own and others' good each hour employ, And all things smile with universal joy; Virtue with Happiness her consort join'd, Wou'd regulate and bless each human mind, And man be what his Maker first design'd. The FEMALE DRUM: Or, The Origin of Cards. A Tale. Address'd to the Honourable Miss Carpenter. Thou, whom to counsel is to praise, With candor view these friendly lays, Nor from the vice of gaming free, Believe the satire points at thee; Who truth and worth betimes can'st prize, Nor yet too sprightly to be wise, But hear this tale of ancient time, Nor think it vain, tho' told in rhyme. Elate with wide-extended pow'r, Sworn rivals from the natal hour, Av'rice and Sloth, with hostile art Contended long for woman's heart; She fond of wealth, afraid of toil, Still shifted the capricious smile; By turns, to each the heart was sold, Now bought with ease, and now with gold; Scarce either grasp the sov'reign sway, When chance revers'd the prosp'rous day. The doubtful strife was still renew'd, Each baffled oft, but ne'er subdu'd; When Av'rice shew'd the glitt'ring prize, And hopes and fears began to rise, Sloth shed on ev'ry busy sense The gentle balm of indolence. When Sloth had screen'd, with artful night, The soft pavilion of delight; Stern Av'rice, with reproachful frown, Would scatter thorns amongst her down. Thus each by turns the realm controul'd, Which each in turn despair'd to hold; At length unable to contend, They join to chuse a common friend, To close in love the long debate, Such love, as mutual fears create; A friend they chose, a friend to both, Of Av'rice born, and nurs'd by Sloth; An artful nymph, whose reign began When Wisdom ceas'd to dwell with man; In Wisdom's aweful robes array'd, She rules o'er politicks and trade; And by the name of Cunning known, Makes wealth, and fame, and pow'r her own. In quest of Cunning then they rove O'er all the windings of the grove, Where twining boughs their shade unite, For Cunning ever flies the light; At length thro' maze perplex'd with maze, Through tracts confus'd, and private ways, With sinking hearts and weary feet, They gain their fav'rite's dark retreat; There, watchful at the gate, they find Suspicion, with her eyes behind; And wild Alarm, awaking, blows The trump that shakes the world's repose. The guests well known, salute the guard, The hundred gates are soon unbarr'd; Through half the gloomy cave they press, And reach the wily queen's recess; The wily queen disturb'd, they view, With schemes to fly, though none pursue; And, in perpetual care to hide, What none will ever seek, employ'd. “Great queen (they pray'd) our feuds compose, “And let us never more be foes.” “This hour (she cries) your discord ends, “Henceforth, be Sloth and Av'rice friends; “Henceforth, with equal pride, prepare “To rule at once the captive fair.” Th'attentive pow'rs in silence heard, Nor utter'd what they hop'd or fear'd, But search in vain the dark decree, For Cunning loves obscurity; Nor wou'd she soon her laws explain, For Cunning ever joys to pain. She then before their wond'ring eyes, Bid piles of painted paper rise; “Search now these heaps, (she cries) here find “Fit emblem of your pow'r combin'd.” The heap to Av'rice first she gave, Who soon descry'd her darling Knave: And Sloth, ere Envy long cou'd sting, With joyful eyes beheld a King, “These gifts (said Cunning) bear away, “Sure engines of despotick sway; “These charms dispense o'er all the ball, “Secure to rule where'er they fall. “The love of cards let Sloth infuse, “The love of money soon ensues; “The strong desire shall ne'er decay, “Who plays to win, shall win to play; “The breast, where love has plann'd his reign, “Shall burn, unquench'd, with lust of gain; “And all the charms that wit can boast, “In dreams of better luck be lost.” Thus neither innocent, nor gay, The useless hours shall fleet away, While Time o'erlooks the trivial strife, And, scoffing, shakes the sands of life; Till the wan maid, whose early bloom The vigils of quadrille consume; Exhausted, by the pangs of play, To Sloth and Av'rice falls a prey. To Mr. FOX, written at Florence. In Imitation of Horace, Ode 4. Book 2. By the late Lord H?y. Septimi, Gades aditure mecum. Thou dearest youth, who taught me first to know What pleasures from a real friendship flow, Where neither interest nor design have part, But all the warmth is native of the heart; Thou know'st to comfort, sooth, or entertain, Joy of my health, and cordial of my pain. When life seem'd failing on her latest stage, And fell disease anticipated age, When wasting sickness and afflicted pain, By Esculapius' sons oppos'd in vain; Forc'd me reluctant, desperate, to explore A warmer sun, and seek a milder shore; Thy steady love with unexampled truth, Forsook each gay companion of thy youth, Whate'er the prosp'rous or the great employs, Bus'ness and int'rest, and love's softer joys, The weary steps of mis'ry to attend, To share distress, and make a wretch thy friend. If o'er the mountain's snowy height we stray, Where Carthage first explor'd the vent'rous way; Or thro' the tainted air of Rome's parch'd plains, Where Want resides, and Superstition reigns; Chearful and unrepining, still you bear Each dangerous rigour of the various year; And kindly anxious for thy friend alone, Lament his suff'rings and forget thy own. Oh! would kind Heav'n, these tedious suff'rings past, Permit me Ickworth, rest, and health at last, In that lov'd shade, my youth's delightful seat, My early pleasure, and my late retreat, Where lavish Nature's favourite blessings flow, And all the seasons all their sweets bestow; There might I trifle carelesly away The milder evening of life's clouded day, From bus'ness and the world's intrusion free, With books, with love, with beauty, and with thee; No farther want, no wish yet unpossess'd Could e'er disturb this unambitious breast. Let those who Fortune's shining gifts implore, Who sue for glory, splendor, wealth, or power, View this unactive state, with scornful eyes, And pleasures they can never taste, despise; Let them still court that goddess' falser joys, Who, while she grants their pray'r, their peace destroys. I envy not the foremost of the great, Not Walpole's self, directing Europe's fate; Still let him load Ambition's thorny shrine, Fame be his portion, and contentment mine. But if the gods, sinister still, deny To live in Ickworth, let me there but die; Thy hand to close my eyes in death's long night, Thy image to attract their latest sight: Then to the grave attend thy poet's herse, And love his mem'ry as you lov'd his verse. To the Same. From Hampton-Court, 1731. By the Same. Bono loco humanæ sunt, quod nemo, nisi vitio suo, miser est. Seneca in Epist. Whilst in the fortunes of the gay and great, The glare of courts, and luxury of state; All that the meaner covet and deplore, The pomp of wealth, and insolence of power: Whilst in these various scenes of gilded life, Of fraud, ambition, policy, and strife; Where every word is dictated by art, And ev'ry face the mask of ev'ry heart; Whilst with such diff'rent objects entertain'd, In all that's really felt, and all that's feign'd, I speculate on human joys and woes, Till from my pen the verse spontaneous flows; To whom these artless off'rings should I bring, To whom these undigested numbers sing, But to a friend?—and to what friend but you, Safe, just, sincere, indulgent, kind and true? Disdain not then these trifles to attend, Nor fear to blame. nor study to commend. Say, where false notions erring I pursue, And with the plausible confound the true: Correct with all the freedom that I write; And guide my darken'd reason with thy light. Thee partial heaven has bless'd, profusely kind, With wit, with judgment, and a taste refin'd, Thy fancy rich, and thy observance true, The last still wakeful, and the first still new. Rare blessings! and to few divided known, But giv'n united to thyself alone. Instruction are thy words, and lively truth, The school of age, and the delight of youth. When men their various discontents relate, And tell how wretched this our mortal state; That life is but diversify'd distress, The lot of all, and hardly more or less; That kings and villagers have each their share, These pinch'd with mean, and those with splendid care; That seeming pleasure is intrinsick woe, And all call'd happiness, delusive show; Food only for the snakes in Envy's breast, Who often grudges what is ne'er possess'd; Say, for thou know'st the follies of mankind, Can'st tell how obstinate, perverse, and blind; Say, are we thus oppress'd by Nature's laws, Or of our miseries, ourselves the cause? Sure oft, unjustly, we impute to Fate A thousand evils which ourselves create; Complain that life affords but little joy, And yet that little foolishly destroy. We check the pleasures that too soon subside, And break the current of too weak a tide. Like Atalanta, golden trifles chace, And baulk that swiftness which might win the race; For life has joys adapted to each stage, Love for our youth, ambition for our age. But wilful man inverting her decrees, When young would govern, and when old would please, Covets the fruits his autumn shou'd bestow, Nor tastes the fragrance whilst the blossoms blow. Then far-fled joys in vain he would restore, His appetite unanswer'd by his pow'r: Round beauty's neck he twists his wither'd arms, Receives with loathing to her venal charms: He rakes the ashes, when the fire is spent, Nor gains fruition, tho' he gains consent. But can we say 'tis Providence's fault, If thus untimely all her gifts are sought, If summer-crops which must decay we keep, And in the winter would the harvest reap? When brutes, with what they are allow'd content, Listen to Nature, and pursue her bent, And still their pow'r with their ambition weigh'd, Gain what they can, but never force a trade: A thousand joys her happy followers prove, Health, plenty, rest, society, and love. To us alone, in fatal ign'rance proud, To deviate from her dictates 'tis allow'd: That boasted gift our reason to believe, Or let caprice, in reason's garb, deceive. To us the noble privilege is given Of wise refining on the will of heav'n. Our skill we trust, but lab'ring still to gain More than we can, lose what we might obtain. Will the wise elephant desert the wood, To imitate the whale and range the flood? Or will the mole her native earth forsake, In wanton madness to explore the lake? Yet man, whom still ideal profit sways, Than those less prudent, and more blind than these, Will quit his home, and vent'rous brave the seas. And when his rashness its desert has found, The fool surviving, weeps the fool that's drown'd. Herds range the fields, the feather'd kind the grove, Chuse, woo, caress, and with promiscuous love, As taste and nature prompt, adhere, or rove; They meet with pleasure, and with ease they part, For beasts are only coupled by the heart. The body still accompanies the mind, And when this wanders, that is unconfin'd: The love that join'd the sated pair once fled, They change their haunts, their pasture, and their bed. No four-legg'd ideots drag, with mutual pain, The nat'ral cement pass'd, an artful chain: Th'effect of passion ceases with the cause, Clogg'd with no after-weight of forms or laws: To no dull rules of custom they submit, Like us they cool, but when they cool, they quit. Nor find we in the wood, the sea, or plain, One e'er elected o'er the rest to reign. If any rule, 'tis force that gives the law, What brutes are bound in voluntary awe? Do they, like us, a pageant idol raise, Swoln with false pride, and flatter'd by false praise? Do they their equal, sometimes less, revere? At once detest and serve, despise and fear? To strength inferior do they bend the knee? With ears and eyes of others hear and see? Or ever vest a mortal god with pow'r To do those wrongs they afterwards deplore? These institutions are of man alone, Marriage and monarchy are both our own. Public oppression, and domestic strife, Are ills which we ourselves annex'd to life, God never made a husband, king, or wife. Boast then, oh man! thy profitable gain, To folly polish'd, civiliz'd to pain. Here would I launch into the various field Of all the cares our prejudices yield; What multiply'd examples might be told, Of pains they give, and joys that they withold? When to credulity tradition preaches, And ign'rance practises what error teaches! Wou'd any feather'd maiden of the wood, Or scaly female of the peopled flood, When lust and hunger call'd, its force resist? In abstinence, or chastity persist? And cry, ‘If heaven's intent was understood, ‘These tastes were only given to be withstood.’ Or wou'd they wisely both these gifts improve, And eat when hungry, and when am'rous love? Yet superstition, in religion's name, With future punishment and present shame, Can fright weak woman from her lover's arms, Who weeps with mutual pain her useless charms; Whilst she, poor wretch! consum'd in secret fires, With pow'r to seize, foregoes what she desires, Till beauty fades, and inclination dies, And the fair tree, the fruit ungather'd, dies. But are these ills, the ills which heav'n design'd? Are we unfortunate, or are we blind? If in possession of our wishes curs'd, Bath'd in untasted springs we die with thirst; If we make miseries, what were blessings meant, And benefits convert to punishment? When in the spring the wise industrious bees Collect the various bloom from fragrant trees, Extract the liquid sweet of ev'ry flow'r, And cull the garden to enrich their store: Should any pedant bee of all the hive, From this or that perfume the plund'rers drive, And say, that he by inspiration knows, The sacred, tempting, interdicting rose, By heav'n's command, tho' sweetest, useless grows: Think you the fool would ever be obey'd, And that the lye would grow into a trade? Ev'n Turks would answer, no—and yet, we see The vine, that rose, and Mahomet, that bee. To these, how many proofs I yet could add, That man's superior sense is being mad? That none, refining, their true int'rest view, But for the substance, still the shade pursue. That oft perverse, and prodigal of life, (Our pow'r and will at everlasting strife) We waste the present for the future hour, And, miser-like, by hoarding, still are poor. Or foolishly regretful of the past, The good which yet remains neglect to taste. Nor need I any foreign proof to bring, Myself an instance of the truths I sing. Whilst in a court, repugnant to my taste, From my lov'd friend these precious hours I waste, Why do I vainly here thy absence mourn, And not anticipate thy wish'd return? Why stay my passage to those happy fields, Where fate in thee my ev'ry pleasure yields? Fortune allows the blessings I refuse, And ev'n this moment, were my heart to chuse, For thee I should forsake this joyless crowd, And not on paper think, but think aloud: With thy lov'd converse fill the shorten'd day, And glad my soul—Yet here unpleas'd I stay, And by mean, sanguine views of int'rest sway'd, By airy hopes, to real cares betray'd; Lament a grievance which I might redress, And wish that happiness I might possess. The POET's PRAYER. If e'er in thy sight I found favour, Apollo, Defend me from all the disasters which follow: From the knaves and the fools, and the fops of the time, From the drudges in prose, and the triflers in rhyme: From the pacth-work and toils of the royal sack-bibber, Those dead birth-day odes, and the farces of Cibber: From servile attendance on men in high places, Their worships, and honours, and lordships, and graces: From long dedications to patrons unworthy, Who hear and receive, but will do nothing for thee: From being caress'd to be left in the lurch, The tool of a party, in state or in church: From dull thinking blockheads, as sober as Turks, And petulant bards who repeat their own works: From all the gay things of a drawing-room show, The sight of a Belle, and the smell of a Beau: From busy back-biters, and tatlers, and carpers, And scurvy acquaintance of fidlers and sharpers: From old politicians, and coffee-house lectures, The dreams of a chymist, and schemes of projectors: From the fears of a jail, and the hopes of a pension, The tricks of a gamester, and oaths of an ensign: From shallow free-thinkers in taverns disputing, Nor ever confuted, nor ever confuting: From the constant good fare of another man's board, My lady's broad hints, and the jests of my lord: From hearing old chymists prelecting de oleo, And reading of Dutch commentators in folio: From waiting, like Gay, whole years at White-hall; From the pride of gay wits, and the envy of small: From very fine ladies with very fine incomes, Which they finely lay out on fine toys and fine trincums: From the pranks of ridottoes and court-masquerades, The snares of young jilts, and the spite of old maids: From a saucy dull stage, and submitting to share In an empty third night with a beggarly play'r: From Curl and such Printers as would ha' me curs'd To write second parts, let who will write the first: From all pious patriots, who would to their best, Put on a new tax, and take off an old test: From the faith of informers, the fangs of the law, And the great rogues, who keep all the lesser in awe: From a poor country cure, that living interment, With a wife and no prospect of any preferment: From scribbling for hire, when my credit is sunk, To buy a new coat, and to line an old trunk: From 'squires, who divert us with jokes at their tables, Of hounds in their kennels, and nags in their stables: From the nobles and commons, who bound in strict league are To subscribe for no book, yet subscribe to Heidegger: From the cant of fanaticks, the jargon of schools, The censures of wisemen, and praises of fools: From criticks who never read Latin or Greek, And pedants, who boast they read both all the week: From borrowing wit, to repay it like Budgel, Or lending, like Pope, to be paid by a cudgel: If ever thou didst, or wilt ever befriend me, From these, and such evils, Apollo, defend me, And let me be rather but honest with no-wit, Than a noisy nonsensical half-witted poet. An EPISTLE to a Lady. When the heart akes with anguish, pines with grief, And heav'n and you alike deny relief; When ev'n the flatt'rer Hope is no where found, 'Tis hard to feel the smart, and not lament the wound. Permit me then to sigh one last adieu, Nor scorn a sorrow friendship owes to you: A friendship modesty might well return; A sorrow, cruelty itself might mourn. Think how the miser, pierc'd with inward pain, Looks down with horror on the troubled main, Or wildly roams along the rocky coast, T'explore his treasures in the tempest lost; Hates his own safety, chides the waves that roll'd Himself ashore, but sunk his dearer gold. Like him afflicted, pensive, and forlorn, I look on life and all its pomp with scorn. You was the sweetner of each busy scene; You gave the joy without, the pain within. Pleasure and you were both so near ally'd, That when I lost the one, the other dy'd; Pain too has lavish'd all her killing store; Nor can she add, nor can I suffer more. In vain I view'd you with as chaste a fire, As angels mingle, or as saints admire; By reason prompted, passion had no part, A virtuous ardour, that refin'd the heart. In vain I sought a friendship free from fault, Where sex and beauty were alike forgot: A friendship by the noblest union join'd, The female softness, and the manly mind. Courage to conquer evils, or endure: Sweetness to sooth the pain, and smiles to cure. Scandal, a busy fiend, in Truth's disguise, Like Fame all cover'd o'er with ears and eyes, Learns the fond tale, and spreads it as she flies; Nor spreads alone, but alters, adds, defames, Affects to pity, tho' her duty blames; Feigns not to credit all she sees or hears, But hopes the evil only in her fears; Pretends to weigh the fact in even scale, And wish, at least, that justice may prevail; Insinuates, dissembles, lyes, betrays, Plays the whole hypocrite such various ways, That Innocence itself must suffer wrong, And Honour bleed the prey of Slander's tongue. Such is my fate, so grievous my distress, Condemn'd to suffer, but deny'd redress: Too fond of joy, too sensible of pain, To part with all that's dear, and not complain: Too delicate to injure what I love, To ask the pity fame will ne'er approve. What more remains, then, but to drop my claim, And by my conduct justify my flame? Burst the dear bands that to my heart-strings join, And sacrifice my peace to purchase thine? As the fond mother, who delirious eyes Her dying babe, will scarce believe it dies; But strains it still with transport in her arms, Dwells on its lips and numbers o'er its charms; Pleads that it slumbers, and expects, in vain, To see the little cherub live again: So my torn heart must all the sorrows prove That torture constancy, or sadden love: Yet fondly follow your dear image still, Fancy I hear you speak, I see you smile: Doat on a phantom, idolize the name, And wish the shade and substance were the same. Alas! how fruitless is the idle pray'r! The joy's imagin'd, real the despair. Like Adam forc'd his Eden to forego, I lose my only paradise below, And dread the prospect of succeeding woe. GENIUS, VIRTUE, and REPUTATION. A FABLE. From Mons. De la Motte, Book v. Fable 6. The attribution of this poem is questionable. As Genius, Virtue, Reputation, Three worthy friends, o'er all the nation Agreed to roam; then pass the seas, And visit Italy and Greece: By travel to improve their parts, And learn the languages and arts; Not like our modern fops and beaus, T'improve the pattern of their cloaths: Thus Genius said;—“Companions dear, “To what I speak, incline an ear. “Some chance, perhaps, may us divide: “Let us against the worst provide, “And give some sign by which to find “A friend thus lost, or left behind. “For me, if cruel fate should ever “Me and my dear companions sever, “Go, seek me 'midst the walls of Rome, “At Angelo's or Raphael's tomb; “Or else at Virgil's sacred shrine, “Lamenting with the mournful Nine.” Next Virtue, pausing;—(for she knew The places were but very few, Where she could fairly hope to stay Till her companions came that way;) “Pass by (she cry'd) the court, the ball, “The masquerade and carnival, “Where all in false disguise appear, “But Vice, whose face is ever bare; “'Tis ten to one, I am not there. “Cælia, the loveliest maid on earth! “I've been her friend, e'er since her birth; “Perfection in her person charms, “And virtue all her bosom warms; “A matchless pattern for the fair: “Her dwelling seek, you'll find me there.” Cry'd Reputation, “I, like you, “Had once a soft companion too: “As fair her person, and her fame, “And Coquettissa was her name. “Ten thousand lovers swell'd her train; “Ten thousand lovers sigh'd in vain: “Where-e'er she went, the danglers came; “Yet still I was her favourite flame, “Till once,—('twas at the public show) “The play being done, we rose to go; “A thing, who long had ey'd the fair, “His neck stiff yok'd in solitaire, “With clean white gloves first made approach, “Then begg'd to lead her to her coach: “She smil'd, and gave her lilly hand; “Away they trip it to the Strand: “A hackney-coach receive the pair, “They went to—but, I won't tell where. “Then lost she Reputation quite, “Friends take example from that night, “And never leave me from your sight. “For oh! if cruel fate intends “Ever to part me from my friends, “Think that I'm dead; my death deplore, “But never hope to see me more! “In vain you'll search the world around; “Lost Reputation's never to be found.” MARRIAGE A-LA-MODE. OR THE TWO SPARROWS. A Fable. From Mons. De la Motte, Book iv. Fable 21. The attribution of this poem is questionable. A grove there was, by nature made, Of trees that form'd a pleasing shade; Where warbled, ever free from care, The wing'd musicians of the air. Here tun'd the Nightingale her throat; The Thrush there thrill'd her piercing note; The Finch, Lark, Linnet, all agree To join the sylvan harmony. Two amorous Sparrows chose this place; The softest of the feather'd race: The Mars and Venus of the grove; Less fam'd for singing than for love. The songsters warbled sweet; while they As sweetly bill'd their time away. So closely seated were the two, Together you wou'd think they grew: The twig was tender where they sate. And bent beneath their little weight; But scarcely in their lives was known To bear the one, when one was flown. When hunger call'd, they left the wood, Together sought the field for food; When thirsty, in the shallow rills Together dip'd their little bills. When Phoebus sitting in the west, And thick'ning shades invite to rest, They homeward bent their mutual flight: Thus pass'd their day, thus pass'd their night. The castle, where these lovers lay, Was in a hollow oak, they say: There, side by side, all night they kept, Together walk'd, together slept: And mixing amorous disport, They made their winter-evening short. Tho' free, 'twas left to other's mind, To chuse a mate from all their kind, She only lov'd the loving he; He only lov'd the lovely she. Pure Joy, poor mortals seldom find; Her footman, Sorrow, waits behind: And Fate impartial deals to all The honey'd potion mix'd with gall. This pair, on an unhappy day, Too far together chanc'd to stray; Benighted, and with snares beset, Our Mars and Venus in a net, Alas! were caught.—O change of state! A little cage is now their fate. No more they seek the spacious grove: No more they burn with mutual love: Their passion changes with their life; And soon they fall from love to strife. Their little souls with growing rage High swell; they flutter round the cage: Forget the slender twig, where late Close side by side in love they sate; One perch is now too small to hold The fiery mate and chirping scold: They peck each other o'er their food; And thirst to drink each other's blood. Two cages must the pair divide; Or death the quarrel will decide. A picture this of human life! The modern husband, and the wife. Who e'er in courtship saw a pair, So kind as he, as she so fair? The kisses that they gave each other, You'd think had seal'd their lips together; Each vows to each a mutual flame; And dreams, 'twill always last the same; But fix them once in Hymen's chains, And each alternately complains. The honey-moon is scarce declin'd, But all the honey of their mind Is gone; and leaves the sting behind. The scene of love is vanish'd quite: They pout, grow peevish, scold, and fight. Two tables feed each parted guest; Two beds receive the pair to rest: And law alone can end the strife, With separate-maintenance for life. An INSCRIPTION. Quercus loquitur. O YE! Who by retirement to these sacred groves Impregnate fancy, and on thought divine Build harmony—If sudden glow your breast With inspiration, and the rapt'rous song Bursts from a mind unconscious whence it sprang: —Know that the sisters of these hallow'd haunts, Dryad or Hamadryad, tho' no more From Jove to man prophetick truths they sing; Are still attendant on the lonely bard, Who step by step these silent woods among Wanders contemplative, lifting the soul From lower cares, by every whisp'ring breeze Tun'd the poetick mood; and fill the mind With truths oracular, themselves of old Deign'd utter from the Dodonean shrine. ODE to WISDOM. By a LADY. The solitary bird of night Thro' the thick shades now wings his flight, And quits his time-shook tow'r; Where, shelter'd from the blaze of day, In philosophick gloom he lay Beneath his ivy bow'r. With joy I hear the solemn sound, Which midnight echoes waft around, And sighing gales repeat. Fav'rite of Pallas! I attend, And faithful to thy summons, bend At Wisdom's aweful seat. She loves the cool, the silent eve, Where no false shews of life deceive, Beneath the lunar ray. Here Folly drops each vain disguise, Nor sport her gaily-colour'd dyes, As in the beam of day, O Pallas! queen of ev'ry art, That glads the sense, and mends the heart, Blest source of purer joys: In every form of beauty bright, That captivates the mental sight With pleasure and surprize: At thy unspotted shrine I bow; Attend thy modest suppliant's vow, That breathes no wild desires: But taught by thy unerring rules, To shun the fruitless wish of fools, To nobler views aspires. Not Fortune's gem, Ambition's plume, Nor Cytherea's fading bloom, Be objects of my pray'r: Let Av'rice, Vanity, and Pride, Those envy'd glitt'ring toys, divide The dull rewards of care. To me thy better gifts impart, Each moral beauty of the heart, By studious thoughts refin'd: For Wealth, the smiles of glad Content; For Pow'r, its amplest, best extent, An empire o'er the mind. When Fortune drops her gay parade, When Pleasure's transient roses fade, And wither in the tomb; Unchang'd is thy immortal prize, Thy ever-verdant laurels rise In undecaying bloom. By thee protected, I defy The coxcomb's sneer, the stupid lye Of ignorance and spite: Alike contemn the leaden fool, And all the pointed ridicule Of undiscerning wit. From envy, hurry, noise and strife, The dull impertinence of life, In thy retreat I rest: Pursue thee to the peaceful groves, Where Plato's sacred spirit roves, In all thy beauties dress'd. He bade Ilissus' tuneful stream Convey thy philosophick theme Of Perfect, Fair, and Good: Attentive Athens caught the sound, And all her list'ning sons around In aweful silence stood: Reclaim'd, her wild licentious youth Confess'd the potent voice of Truth, And felt its just controul: The Passions ceas'd their loud alarms, And Virtue's soft persuasive charms O'er all their senses stole. Thy breath inspires the Poet's song, The Patriot's free, unbias'd tongue, The Hero's gen'rous strife; Thine are Retirement's silent joys, And all the sweet engaging ties Of still domestick life. No more to fabled Names confin'd, To the supreme all-perfect Mind My thoughts direct their flight: Wisdom's thy gift, and all her force From thee deriv'd, eternal source Of intellectual light. O send her sure, her steady ray, To regulate my doubtful way Thro' life's perplexing road: The mists of error to controul, And thro' its gloom direct my soul To happiness and good. Beneath her clear discerning eye The visionary shadows fly Of Folly's painted show: She sees thro' ev'ry fair disguise, That all but Virtue's solid joys Are vanity and woe. To a GENTLEMAN, On his intending to cut down a Grove to enlarge his Prospect. By the Same. In plaintive sounds, that tun'd to woe The sadly sighing breeze, A weeping Hamadryad mourn'd Her fate-devoted trees. Ah! stop thy sacrilegious hand, Nor violate the shade, Where Nature form'd a silent haunt For Contemplation's aid. Can'st thou, the son of Science, bred Where learned Isis flows, Forget that, nurs'd in shelt'ring groves, The Grecian genius rose? Within the plantane's spreading shade, Immortal Plato taught; And fair Lyceum form'd the depth Of Aristotle's thought. To Latian groves reflect thy views, And bless the Tuscan bloom; Where Eloquence deplor'd the fate Of Liberty and Rome. Retir'd beneath the beechen shade, From each inspiring bough The Muses wove th'unfading wreaths That circled Virgil's brow. Reflect before the fatal ax My threaten'd doom has wrought; Nor sacrifice to sensual taste The nobler growth of thought. Not all the glowing fruits that blush On India's sunny coast, Can recompence thee for the worth Of one idea lost. My shade a produce may supply, Unknown to solar fire; And what excludes Apollo's rays, Shall harmonize his lyre. THE ESTIMATE of LIFE, IN THREE PARTS. A POEM: By JOHN GILBERT COOPER, Esq; PART I. Melpomene: or, The Melancholy. ? Reason thus with Life; If I lose thee, I do lose a thing, That none but fools would weep. Shakesp. Meas. for Meas. Offspring of folly and of noise, Fantastick train of airy joys, Cease, cease your vain delusive lore, And tempt my serious thoughts no more, Ye horrid forms, ye gloomy throng, Who hear the bird of midnight's song; Thou too, Despair, pale spectre, come, From the self-murd'rer's haunted tomb, While sad Melpomene relates, How we're afflicted by the fates. What's all this wish'd-for empire, Life? A scene of mis'ry, care, and strife; And make the most, that's all we have Betwixt the cradle and the grave. The being is not worth the charge, Behold the estimate at large. Our youth is silly, idle, vain; Our age is full of care and pain; From wealth accrues anxiety; Contempt and want from poverty; What trouble business has in store! How idleness fatigues us more! To reason, th'ignorant are blind; The learned's eyes are too refin'd Each wit deems every wit his foe, Each fool is naturally so; And ev'ry rank and ev'ry station Meet justly with disapprobation. Say, man, is this the boasted state, Where all is pleasant, all is great? Alas! another face you'll see, Take off the vail of vanity. Is aught in pleasure, aught in pow'r, Has wisdom any gift in store, To make thee stay a single hour? Tell me, ye youthful, who approve Th'intoxicating sweets of love, What endless nameless throbs arise, What heart-felt anguish and what sighs, When jealousy has gnaw'd the root, Whence love's united branches shoot. Or grant that Hymen lights his torch, To lead you to the nuptial porch, Behold! the long'd-for rapture o'er! Desire begins to lose its pow'r, Then cold indifference takes place, Fruition alters quite the case; And what before was extasy, Is scarcely now civility. Your children bring a second care; If childless, then you want an heir; So that in both alike you find The same perplexity of mind. Do pow'r or wealth more comfort own? Behold yon pageant on a throne, Where silken swarms of flattery Obsequious wait his asking eye. But view within his tortur'd breast, No more the downy seat of rest, Suspicion casts her poison'd dart, And guilt, that scorpion, stings his heart. Will knowledge give us happiness? In that, alas! we know there's less, For every pang of mental woe Springs from the faculty, to know. Hark! at the death-betok'ning knell Of yonder doleful passing-bell, Perhaps a friend, a father's dead, Or the lov'd partner of thy bed! Perhaps thy only son lies there, Breathless upon the sable bier! Say, what can ease the present grief, Can former joys afford relief? Those former joys remember'd still, The more augment the recent ill, And where you seek for comfort, gain Additional increase of pain. What woes from mortal ills accrue! And what from natural ensue! Disease and casualty attend Our footsteps to the journey's end; The cold catarrh, the gout and stone, The dropsy, jaundice, join'd in one, The raving fever's inward heat, The pale consumption's fatal sweat, And thousand more distempers roam, To drag us to th'eternal home. And when solution sets us free From prison of mortality, The soul dilated joins in air, To go, alas! we know not where, And the poor body will become A cloud within a lonely tomb. Reflection sad! such bodies must Return, and mingle with the dust! But neither sense nor beauty have Defensive charms against the grave, Nor virtue's shield, nor wisdom's lore, Nor true religion's sacred pow'r; For as that charnel's earth you see, E'en, my Eudocia, you will be. PART II. Calliope: or, The Chearful. Inter cuncta leges et percunctabere doctos Qua ratione queas traducere leniter ævum. Hor. Lib. 1. Ep. 18. Grim Superstition, hence away To native night, and leave the day, Nor let thy hellish brood appear, Begot on Ignorance and Fear. Come, gentle Mirth, and Gaiety, Sweet daughter of Society; Whilst fair Calliope pursues Flights worthy of the chearful muse. O life, thou great essential good, Where ev'ry blessing's understood! Where Plenty, Freedom, Pleasure meet, To make each fleeting moment sweet, Where moral Love and Innocence, The balm of sweet Content dispense, Where Peace expands her turtle wings, And Hope a constant requiem sings, With easy thought my breast inspire, To thee I tune the sprightly lyre. From Heav'n this emanation flows, To Heav'n again the wand'rer goes: And whilst employ'd beneath on earth, Its boon attendants, Ease and Mirth, Join'd with the Social Virtues three, And their calm parent Charity, Conduct it to the sacred plains Where Happiness terrestrial reigns. 'Tis Discontent alone destroys The harvest of our ripening joys; Resolve to be extempt from woe, Your resolution keeps you so. Whate'er is needful man receives, Nay more superfluous Nature gives, Indulgent parent, source of bliss, Profuse of goodness to excess! For thee 'tis, man, the zephyr blows, For thee the purple vintage flows, Each flow'r its various hue displays, The lark exalts her vernal lays, To view yon azure vault is thine, And my Eudocia's form divine. Hark! how the renovating Spring Invites the feather'd choir to sing, Spontaneous mirth and rapture glow On ev'ry shrub, and ev'ry bough, Their little airs a lesson give, They teach us mortals how to live, And well advise us whilst we can, To spend in joy the vital span. Ye gay and youthful all advance, Together knit in festive dance, See blooming Hebe leads the way, For youth is Nature's holiday. If dire Misfortune should employ Her dart to wound the timely joy, Solicit Bacchus with your pray'r, No earthly goblin dares come near, Care puts an easier aspect on, Pale Anger smooths her threat'ning frown, Mirth comes in Melancholy's stead, And Discontent conceals her head. The thoughts on vagrant pinions fly, And mount exulting to the sky; Thence with enraptur'd views look down On golden empires all their own. Or let, when Fancy spreads her sails, Love waft you on with easier gales, Where in the soul-bewitching groves, Euphrosine, sweet goddess, roves; 'Tis rapture all, 'tis extasy! An earthly immortality! This all the ancient Bards employ'd, 'Twas all the ancient Gods enjoy'd, Who often from the realms above Came down on earth t'indulge in love. Still there's one greater bliss in store, 'Tis virtuous Friendship's social hour, When goodness from the heart sincere Pours forth Compassion's balmy tear, For from those tears such transports flow, As none but friends, and angels know. Blest state! where ev'ry thing conspires To fill the breast with heav'nly fires! Where for a while the soul must roam, To preconceive the state to come, And when thro' life the journey's past, Without repining or distaste, Again the spirit will repair, To breathe a more celestial air, And reap, where blessed beings glow, Completion of the joys below. PART III. Terpsichore: or, The Moderate. —????? ?? ?????? ?? ????? ??. Hom. Od. ?. Hæc satis est orare Jovem. Qui donat et aufert, Det vitam, det opes; æpuum mi animum ipse parabo. Hor. Lib. 1. Ep. 18. Descend, Astræa, from above, Where Jove's celestial daughters rove, And deign once more to bring with thee Thy earth-deserting family, Calm Temperance, and Patience mild, Sweet Contemplation's heavenly child, Reflection firm, and Fancy free, Religion pure, and Probity, Whilst all the Heliconian throng Shall join Terpsichore in song. Ere man great Reason's lord was made, Or the world's first foundations laid, As high in their divine abodes, Consulting sate the mighty gods, Jove on the chaos looking down, Spoke thus from his imperial throne: “Ye deities and potentates, “Aerial pow'rs, and heav'nly states, “Lo, in that gloomy place below, “Where darkness reigns and discord now, “There a new world shall grace the skies, “And a new creature form'd arise, “Who shall partake of our perfections, “And live and act by our directions, “(For the chief bliss of any station “Is nought without communication) “Let therefore ev'ry godhead give “What this new being should receive, “But care important must be had, “To mingle well of good and bad, “That by th'allaying mixture, he “May not approach to deity.” The sovereign spake, the gods agree, And each began in his degree: Behind the throne of Jove there stood Two vessels of celestial wood, Containing just two equal measures, One fill'd with pain, and one with pleasures; The gods drew out from both of these, And mix'd 'em with their essences, (Which essences are heav'nly still, When undisturb'd by nat'ral ill, And man to moral good is prone, Let but the moral pow'rs alone, And not pervert 'em by tuition, Or conjure 'em by superstition) Hence man partakes an equal share Of pleasing thoughts and gloomy care, And Plain and Pleasure e'er shall be, As See the Phædo of Plato. Plato says, in company. Receive the one, and soon the other Will follow to rejoin his brother. Those who with pious pain pursue Calm Virtue, by her sacred clue, Will surely find the mental treasure Of Virtue, only real pleasure: Follow the pleasurable road, That fatal Siren reckons good, 'Twill lead thee to the gloomy cell, Where Pain and Melancholy dwell. Health is the child of Abstinence, Disease, of a luxurious sense; Despair, that hellish fiend, proceeds From loosen'd thoughts, and impious deeds; And the sweet offspring of Content, Flows from the mind's calm government. Thus, man, thy state is free from woe, If thou would'st chuse to make it so. Murmur not then at Heav'n's decree, The gods have given thee liberty, And plac'd within thy conscious breast, Reason, as an unerring test, And should'st thou fix on misery, The fault is not in them, but thee. The PLEASURE of POETRY. An ODE. By Mr. Vansittart. I Happy the babe whose natal hour The Muse propitious deigns to grace, No frowns on his soft fore-head lowr, No cries distort his tender face; But o'er her child, forgetting all her pangs, Insatiate of her smiles, the raptur'd parent hangs. II Let statesmen on the sleepless bed The fate of realms and princes weigh, While in the agonizing head They form ideal scenes of sway; Not long, alas! the fancied charms delight, But melt, like spectre-forms, in silent shades of night. III Ye heavy pedants, dull of lore, Nod o'er the taper's livid flame; Ye misers, still increase your store; Still tremble at the robber's name: Or shudd'ring from the recent dream arise, While visionary fire glows dreadful to your eyes. IV Far other joys the Muses show'r Benignant, on the aching breast, 'Tis theirs in the lone, chearless hour, To lull the lab'ring heart to rest: With bright'ning calms they glad the prospect drear, And bid each groan subside, and dry up ev'ry tear. V From earthly mists, ye gentle Nine! Whene'er you purge the visual ray, Sudden the landscapes fairer shine, And blander smiles the face of day: Ev'n Chloe's lips with brighter vermil glow, And on her youthful cheek the rose-buds fresher blow. VI When Boreas sounds his fierce alarms, And all the green-clad nymphs are fled, Oh! then I lie in Fancy's arms On fragrant May's delicious bed; And thro' the shade, slow-creeping from the dale, Feel on my drowsy face the lilly-breathing gale. VII Or on the mountain's airy height Hear Winter call his howling train, Chas'd by the Spring and Dryads light, That now resume their blissful reign: While smiling Flora binds her Zephyr's brows, With ev'ry various flow'r that Nature's lap bestows. VIII More potent than the Sybil's gold That led Æneas' bold emprize, When you, Calliope, unfold Your laurel branch, each phantom flies! Slow cares with heavy wings beat the dull air, And dread, and pale-ey'd grief, and pain and black despair. IX With you Elysium's happy bow'rs, The mansions of the glorious dead, I visit oft, and cull the flow'rs That rise spontaneous to your tread; Such active virtue warms that pregnant earth, And heav'n with kindlier hand assists each genial birth. X Here oft I wander thro' the gloom, While pendent fruit the leaves among Gleams thro' the shade with golden bloom, Where lurk along the feather'd throng, Whose notes th'eternal spring unceasing chear, Nor leave in mournful silence half the drooping year. XI And oft I view along the plain With slow and solemn steps proceed Heroes and chiefs, an aweful train, And high exalt the laurell'd head; Submiss I honour every sacred name, Deep in the column grav'd of adamantine fame. XII But cease, my Muse, with tender wing Unfledg'd, etherial flight to dare, Stern Cato's bold discourse to sing, Or paint immortal Brutus' air; May Britain ne'er the weight of slav'ry feel, Or bid a Brutus shake for her his crimson steel! XIII Lo! yonder negligenly laid Fast by the stream's impurpled side, Where thro' the thick-entangled shade, The radiant waves of nectar glide, Each sacred poet strikes his tuneful lyre, And wakes the ravish'd heart, and bids the soul aspire. XIV No more is heard the plaintive strain, Or pleasing Melancholy's song, Tibullus here forgets his pain, And joins the love-exulting throng; For Cupid flutters round with golden dart, And fiercely twangs his bow at ev'ry rebel heart. XV There stretch'd at ease Anacreon gay; And on his melting Lesbia's breast, With eye half-rais'd Catullus lay, And gaz'd himself to balmy rest: While Venus' self thro' all the am'rous groves With kisses fresh-distill'd supply'd their constant loves. XVI Now Horace' hand the string inspir'd, My soul, impatient as he sung, The Muse unconquerable fir'd, And heavenly accents seiz'd my tongue; Then lock'd in admiration sweet I bow'd, Confess'd his potent art, nor could forbear aloud. Milton. XVII Hail glorious bard! whose high command, A thousand various strings obey, While joins and mixes to thy hand At once the bold and tender lay! Nor mighty Homer down Parnassus steep, Rolls the full tide of verse so clear, and yet so deep. XVIII O could I catch one ray divine From thy intolerable blaze! To pour strong lustre on my line, And my aspiring song to raise; Then should the Muse her choicest influence shed, And with eternal wreaths entwine my lofty head. XIX Then would I sing the sons of Fame, Th'immortal chiefs of ancient age, Or tell of love's celestial flame, Or ope fair friendship's sacred page, And leave the sullen thought and struggling groan, To take their watchful stands around the gaudy throne. The POWER of POETRY. I When tuneful Orpheus strove by moving strains To sooth the furious hate of rugged swains: The list'ning multitude was pleas'd, Ev'n Rapine drop'd her ravish'd prey, Till by the soft oppression seiz'd, Each savage heard his rage away; And now o'ercome, in kind consent they move, And all is harmony, and all is love! II Not so, when Greece's chief by heav'n inspir'd, With love of arms each glowing bosom fir'd: But now the trembling soldier fled Regardless of the glorious prize; And his brave thirst of honour dead, He durst not meet with hostile eyes; Whilst glittering shields and swords, war's bright array, Were either worn in vain, or basely thrown away. III Soon as the hero by his martial strains, Had kindled virtue in their frozen veins: Afresh the warlike spirit grows, Like flame, the brave contagion ran, See in each sparkling eye it glows, And catches on from man to man! Till rage in every breast to fear succeed; And now they dare, and now they wish to bleed! IV With different movements fraught, were Maro's lays, Taught flowing grief, and kind concern to raise: He sung Marcellus' mournful name! In beauty's, and in glory's bloom, Torn from himself, from friends, from fame, And rapt into an early tomb! He sung, and sorrow stole on all, And sighs began to heave, and tears began to fall! V But Rome's high empress felt the greatest smart, Touch'd both by nature, and the poet's art: For as he sung the mournful strain, So well the hero's portraiture he drew, She saw him sicken, fade again, And in description bleed anew. Then pierc'd, and yielding to the melting lay, She sigh'd, she sainted, sunk, and died away. VI Thus numbers once did human breasts controul! Ah! where dwells now such empire o'er the soul? Transported by harmonious lays, The mind is melted down, or burns: With joy o'er Windsor-forest strays, Or grieves when Eloisa mourns: Still the same ardour kindles every line, And our own Pope is now, what Virgil was, divine. To a Young Lady with Fontenelle's Plurality of Worlds. In this small work, all nature's wonders see, The soften'd features of philosophy. In truth by easy steps you here advance, Truth is diverting, as the best romance. Long had these arts to sages been confin'd, None saw their beauty, till by poring blind; By studying spent, like men that cram too full, From Wisdom's feast they rose not chear'd, but dull: The gay and airy smil'd to see 'em grave, And fled such wisdom like Trophonius' cave. Justly they thought they might those arts despise, Which made men sullen, ere they could be wise. Brought down to sight, with ease you view 'em here; Tho' deep the bottom, yet the stream is clear. Your flutt'ring sex still valued science less; Careless of any but the arts of dress. Their useless time was idly thrown away On empty novels, or some new-born play; The best, perhaps, a few loose hours might spare For some unmeaning thing, miscall'd a pray'r. In vain the glitt'ring orbs, each starry night, With mingling blazes shed a flood of light: Each nymph with cold indiff'rence saw 'em rise; And, taught by fops, to them preferr'd her eyes. None thought the stars were suns so widely sown, None dreamt of other worlds, besides our own. Well might they boast their charms, when ev'ry fair Thought this world all; and her's the brightest here. Ah! quit not the large thoughts this book inspires, For those thin trifles which your sex admires: Assert your claim to sense, and shew mankind, That reason is not to themselves confin'd. The haughty belle, whose beauty's aweful shrine 'Twere sacrilege t'imagine not divine, Who thought so greatly of her eyes before, Bid her read this, and then be vain no more. How poor ev'n you, who reign without controul, If we except the beauties of your soul! Shou'd all beholders feel the same surprize: Shou'd all who see you, see you with my eyes; Were no sick blasts to make that beauty less; Cou'd you be what I think, what all confess: 'Tis but a narrow space those charms engage; The island only, and not half an age! SONG. To SYLVIA. By D. G. If truth can fix thy wav'ring heart, Let Damon urge his claim, He feels the passion void of art, The pure, the constant flame. Tho' sighing swains their torments tell, Their sensual love contemn; They only prize the beauteous shell, But slight the inward gem. Possession cures the wounded heart, Destroys the transient fire; But when the mind receives the dart, Enjoyment whets desire. By age your beauty will decay, Your mind improves with years; As when the blossoms fade away, The rip'ning fruit appears: May heav'n and Sylvia grant my suit, And bless the future hour, That Damon, who can taste the fruit, May gather ev'ry flow'r! To the Author of the Farmer's Letters, which were written in Ireland in the Year of the Rebellion, by Henry Brooke, Esq; 1745. By the Same. Oh thou, whose artless, free-born genius charms, Whose rustick zeal each patriot bosom warms; Pursue the glorious task, the pleasing toil, Forsake the fields and till a nobler soil; Extend the Farmer's care to human kind, Manure the heart, and cultivate the mind; There plant religion, reason, freedom, truth, And sow the seeds of virtue in our youth: Let no rank weeds corrupt, or brambles choak, And shake the vermin from the British oak; From nothern blasts protect the vernal bloom, And guard our pastures from the wolves of Rome. In Britain's liberty ingraft thy name, And reap the harvest of immortal fame! VERSES written in a Book called, Fables for the Female Sex. By the Same. While here the poet points the charms Which bless the perfect dame, How unaffected beauty warms, And wit preserves the flame; How prudence, virtue, sense agree, To form the happy wife: In Lucy, and her book, I see, The Picture, and the Life. VERSES written in Sylvia's PRIOR. By the Same. Untouch'd by love, unmov'd by wit, I found no charms in Matthew's lyre, But unconcern'd read all he writ, Tho' love and Phœbus did inspire: Till Sylvia took her favourite's part, Resolv'd to prove my judgment wrong; Her proofs prevail'd, they reach'd my heart, And soon I felt the poet's song. Upon a LADY's Embroidery. By the Same. Arachne once, as poets tell, A goddess at her art defy'd; But soon the daring mortal fell The hapless victim of her pride. O then beware Arachne's fate, Be prudent, Chloe, and submit; For you'll more surely feel her hate, Who rival both her Art and Wit. DEATH and the DOCTOR. Occasioned by a Physician's lampooning a Friend of the Author. By the Same. As Doctor ? musing sate, Death saw, and came without delay: Enters the room, begins the chat With, “Doctor, why so thoughtful, pray?” The Doctor started from his place, But soon they more familiar grew: And then he told his piteous case, How trade was low, and friends were few. “Away with fear,” the phantom said, As soon as he had heard his tale: “Take my advice and mend your trade, “We both are losers if you fail. “Go write, your wit in satire show, “No matter, whether smart, or true; “Call ? names, the greatest foe “To dullness, folly, pride, and you. “Then copies spread, there lies the trick, “Among your friends besure you send 'em: “For all who read will soon grow sick, “And when you're call'd upon, attend 'em. “Thus trade increasing by degrees, “Doctor, we both shall have our ends: “For you are sure to have your fees, “And I am sure to have your friends. INSCRIPTIONS on a Monument to the Memory of a Lady's favourite Bullfinch. On the Right Side. The goddesses of wit and love Have patroniz'd the owl and dove; From whose protection both lay claim To immortality and fame: Could wit alone, or beauty, give To birds the same prerogative; My double claim had fate defy'd, And Countess of R?d. Lucy's fav'rite ne'er had dy'd. On the Left Side. Tho' here my body lies interr'd, I still can be a tell-tale bird; If David should pollute these shades, And wanton with my lady's maids; Or Dick sneak out to field or park, To play with Mopsy in the dark; Or Will, that noble, generous youth, Should err from wisdom, taste, and truth; And bless'd with all that's fair and good, Should quit a seast for grosser food: I'll rise again a restless sprite, Will haunt my lonely cage by night; There swell my throat and plume my wing, And every tale to Lucy sing. The Trial of SELIM the PERSIAN. For divers High Crimes and Misdemeanours. The court was met; the pris'ner brought; The council with instruction fraught; And evidence prepar'd at large, On oath, to vindicate the charge. But first 'tis meet, where form denies Poetick helps of fancy'd lies, Gay metaphors, and figures fine, And similes to deck the line; 'Tis meet (as we before have said) To call description to our aid. Begin we then (as first 'tis fitting) With the three Chiefs in judgment sitting. Above the rest, and in the chair, Sat Faction with dissembled air; Her tongue was skill'd in specious lyes, And murmurs, whence dissentions rise: A smiling mask her features veil'd Her form the patriot's robe conceal'd; With study'd blandishments she bow'd, And drew the captivated crowd. The next in place, and on the right, Sat Envy, hideous to the sight; Her snaky locks, her hollow eyes, And haggard form forbad disguise; Pale discontent, and sullen hate Upon her wrinkled forehead sate: Her left-hand clench'd, her cheek sustain'd, Her right (with many a murder stain'd) A dagger clutch'd, in act to strike, With starts of rage, and aim oblique. Last on the left was Clamour seen, Of stature vast, and horrid mien; With bloated cheeks, and frantick eyes, She sent her yellings to the skies; Prepar'd with trumpet in her hand, To blow sedition o'er the land. With these, four more of lesser fame, And humbler rank, attendant came: Hypocrisy with smiling grace, And Impudence with brazen face, Contention bold, with iron lungs, And Slander with her hundred tongues. The walls in sculptur'd tale were rich, And statues proud (in many a nich) Of chiefs, who fought in Faction's cause, And perish'd for contempt of laws. The roof in vary'd light and shade, The seat of Anarchy display'd. Triumphant o'er a falling throne (By emblematick figure known) Confusion rag'd, and Lust obscene, And Riot with distemper'd mien, And Outrage bold, and Mischief dire, And Devastation clad in fire. Prone on the ground, a martial maid Expiring lay, and groan'd for aid; Her shield with many a stab was pierc'd, Her laurels torn, her spear revers'd; And near her crouch'd, amidst the spoils, A lion painted in the toils. With look compos'd the pris'ner stood, And modest pride. By turns he view'd The court, the council, and the crowd, And with submissive rev'rence bow'd. Proceed we now, in humbler strains, And lighter rhymes, with what remains. Th'indictment grievously set forth, That Selim, lost to truth and worth, (In company with one Will P?t And many more, not taken yet) In Forty-five, the royal palace Did enter, and to shame grown callous, Did then and there his faith forsake, And did accept, receive and take, With mischievous intent and base, Value unknown, a certain place. He was a second time indicted, For that, by evil zeal excited, With learning more than layman's share, (Which parsons want, and he might spare) In letter to one Gilbert West, He, the said Selim, did attest, Maintain, support, and make assertion Of certain points, from Paul's conversion: By means whereof the said apostle Did many an unbeliever jostle, Starting unfashionable fancies, And building truths on known romances. A third charge run, that knowing well Wits only eat, as pamphlets sell, He, the said Selim, notwithstanding Did fall to answ'ring, shaming, branding Three curious Letters to the Whigs; Making no reader care three figs For any facts contain'd therein; By which uncharitable sin, An author, modest and deserving, Was destin'd to contempt and starving; Against the king, his crown and peace, And all the statutes in that case. The pleader rose with brief full charg'd, And on the pris'ner's crimes enlarg'd— But not to damp the Muse's fire With rhet'rick such as courts require, We'll try to keep the reader warm, And sift the matter from the form. Virtue and social love, he said, And honour from the land were fled; That Patriots now, like other folks, Were made the butt of vulgar jokes; While Opposition dropp'd her crest, And courted pow'r for wealth and rest. Why some folks laugh'd, and some folks rail'd, Why some submitted, some assail'd, Angry or pleas'd—all solv'd the doubt With who were in, and who were out. The sons of Clamour grew so sickly, They look'd for dissolution quickly; Their weekly Journals finely written, Were sunk in privies all besh?n; Old-England and the London-Evening, Hardly a soul was found believing in, And Caleb, once so bold and strong, Was stupid now, and always wrong, Ask ye whence rose this foul disgrace? Why Selim has receiv'd a place, And thereby brought the cause to shame; Proving that people, void of blame, Might serve their country and their king, By making both the self-same thing. By which the credulous believ'd, And others (by strange arts deceiv'd) That Ministers were sometimes right, And meant not to destroy us quite. That bart'ring thus in state affairs, He next must deal in sacred wares. The clergy's rights divine invade, And smuggle in the gospel-trade. And all this zeal to re-instate Exploded notions, out of date; Sending old rakes to church in shoals, Like children sniv'ling for their souls, And ladies gay, from smut and libels, To learn beliefs, and read their Bibles; Erecting conscience for a tutor, To damn the present by the future. As if to evils known and real 'Twas needful to annex ideal; When all of human life we know Is care, and bitterness, and woe, With short transitions of delight, To set the shatter'd spirits right. Then why such mighty pains and care, To make us humbler than we are? Forbidding short liv'd mirth and laughter By fears of what may come hereafter? Better in ignorance to dwell; None fear, but who believe an hell: And if there should be one, no doubt Men of themselves would find it out. But Selim's crimes, he said, went further, And barely stopp'd on this side murther; One yet remain'd to close the charge, To which (with leave) he'd speak at large. And first 'twas needful to premise, That tho' so long (for reasons wise) The press inviolate had stood, Productive of the publick good; Yet still, too modest to abuse, It rail'd at vice, but told not whose. That great improvements, of late days Were made, to many an author's praise, Who, not so scrupulously nice, Proclaim'd the person with the vice, Or gave, where vices might be wanted, The name, and took the rest for granted. Upon this plan, a Champion Author of the Letters to the Whigs. rose, Unrighteous greatness to oppose, Proving the man inventus non est, Who trades in pow'r, and still is honest; And (God be prais'd) he did it roundly, Flogging a certain junto soundly; But chief his anger was directed Where people least of all suspected; And Selim, not so strong as tall, Beneath his grasp appear'd to fall. But Innocence (as people say) Stood by, and sav'd him in the fray. By her assisted, and one Truth, A busy, prating, forward youth, He rally'd all his strength anew, And at the foe a letter threw, His weakest part the weapon found, And brought him senseless to the ground. Hence Opposition fled the field, And Ign'rance with her sev'n-fold shield; And well they might, for (things weigh'd fully) The pris'ner, with his Whore and Bully, Must prove for ev'ry foe too hard, Who never fought with such a guard. But Truth and Innocence, he said, Would stand him here in little stead, For they had evidence on oath, That would appear too hard for both. Of witnesses a fearful train Came next th'indictments to sustain; Detraction, Hatred, and Distrust, And Party, of all foes the worst, Malice, Revenge, and Unbelief, And Disappointment, worn with grief, Dishonour foul, unaw'd by shame, And every fiend that vice can name. All these in ample form depos'd Each fact the triple charge disclos'd, With taunts and gibes of bitter sort, And asking vengeance from the court. The pris'ner said in his defence, That he indeed had small pretence To soften facts so deeply sworn, But would for his offences mourn; Yet more he hop'd than bare repentance Might still be urg'd to ward the sentence; That he had held a place some years, He own'd with penitence and tears, But took it not from motives base, Th'indictment there mistook the case; And tho' he had betray'd his trust, In being to his country just, Neglecting Faction and her friends, He did it not for wicked ends, But that complaints and feuds might cease, And jarring parties mix in peace. That what he wrote to Gilbert West Bore hard against him, he confess'd; Yet there they wrong'd him; for the fact is, He reason'd for Belief, not Practice; And people might believe, he thought, Tho' Practice might be deem'd a fault. He either dreamt it, or was told, Religion was rever'd of old, That it gave breeding no offence, And was no foe to wit and sense; But whether this was truth or whim, He would not say; the doubt with him (And no great harm he hop'd) was how Th'enlighten'd world would take it now; If they admitted it, 'twas well, If not, he never talk'd of hell, Nor even hop'd to change men's measures, Or frighten ladies from their pleasures. One accusation, he confess'd, Had touch'd him more than all the rest; Three Patriot-Letters, high in fame, By him o'erthrown, and brought to shame. And though it was a rule in vogue, If one man call'd another rogue, The party injur'd might reply, And on his foe retort the lye; Yet what accru'd from all his labour, But foul dishonour to his neighbour? And he's a most unchristian elf, Who others damns to save himself. Besides, as all men knew, he said, These Letters only rail'd for bread; And hunger was a known excuse For prostitution and abuse; A guinea, properly apply'd, Had made the writer change his side; He wish'd he had not cut and carv'd him, And own'd, he should have bought, not starv'd him. The court, he said, knew all the rest, And must proceed as they thought best; Only he hop'd such resignation Would plead some little mitigation; And if his character was clear From other faults (and friends were near, Who would, when call'd upon, attest it) He did in humblest form request it, To be from punishment exempt, And only suffer their contempt. The pris'ner's friends their claim preferr'd, In turn demanding to be heard. Integrity and Honour swore, Benevolence and twenty more, That he was always of their party, And that they knew him firm and hearty. Religion, sober dame, attended, And, as she could, his cause befriended; She said, 'twas since she came from college She knew him introduc'd by Knowledge; The man was modest and sincere, Nor farther could she interfere. The Muses begg'd to interpose, But Envy with loud hissings rose, And call'd them women of ill fame; Liars, and prostitutes to shame; And said, to all the world 'twas known. Selim had had them ev'ry one. The pris'ner blush'd, the Muses frown'd. When silence was proclaim'd around, And Faction, rising with the rest, In form the pris'ner thus address'd. You, Selim, thrice have been indicted, First, that by wicked pride excited, And bent your country to disgrace, You have receiv'd, and held a Place. Next, Infidelity to wound, You've dar'd, with arguments profound, To drive Freethinking to a stand, And with Religion vex the land. And lastly, in contempt of right, With horrid and unnat'ral spite, You have an Author's fame o'erthrown, Thereby to build and fence your own. These crimes successive, on your trial, Have met with proofs beyond denial; To which yourself, with shame, conceded, And but in mitigation pleaded. Yet that the justice of the court May suffer not in men's report, Judgment a moment I suspend, To reason as from friend to friend. And first, that you, of all mankind, With Kings and Courts should stain your mind! You! who were Opposition's lord! Her nerves, her sinews, and her sword! That you at last, for servile ends, Should wound the bowels of her friends!— Is aggravation of offence, That leaves for mercy no pretence. Yet more—for you to urge your hate, And back the church to aid the state! For you to publish such a letter! You! who have known Religion better! For you, I say, to introduce The fraud again!—There's no excuse. And last of all, to crown your shame, Was it for you to load with blame The writings of a Patriot-Youth, And summon Innocence and Truth To prop your cause?—Was this for you?— But justice does your crimes pursue; And sentence now alone remains, Which thus, by me, the court ordains. “That you return from whence you came, “There to be stripp'd of all your fame “By vulgar hands, that once a week “Old-England pinch you till you squeak; “That ribbald pamphlets do pursue you, “And lyes, and murmurs, to undo you, “With ev'ry foe that Worth procures, “And only Virtue's friends be Yours.” The TROPHY, BEING SIX CANTATAS To the Honour of his Royal Highness Willliam, Duke of CUMBERLAND; Expressing the just Sense of a grateful Nation, in the several Characters of The Volunteer, The Poet, The Painter, The Musician, The Shepherd, The Religious. By ?. Set to Musick by Dr. GREENE. 1746. CANTATA I. The Volunteer. Recitative. Deep in a forest's shadowy seat, A youth enjoy'd his calm retreat, Deaf to the din of civil rage, And discord of the impious age; When visionary sleep depress'd His drowsy lids, and thus alarm'd his rest. Two rival forms immensely bright Appear'd, and charm'd his mental sight; Honour and Pleasure seem'd descending, On each her various train attending, Of decent, sober, great, and plain, Of gay, fantastick, loud, and vain. With confident, yet charming grace, Pleasure first brake the silence of the place. Air. Enjoy with me this calm retreat, Dissolv'd in ease thine hours shall flow: With love alone thy heart shall beat, And this be all th'alarms you know: Cares to sooth, and life befriend, Pleasures on your nod attend. Chorus. Cares to sooth, and life befriend, Pleasures on your nod attend. Recitative. Her decent front strait Honour shew'd, Where mingled scorn and anger glow'd; Contempt of Pleasure's flow'ry reign, Inrag'd at all her abject train; And thus in rapid strains express'd The tumults of her honest breast. Air. Rise, youth—thy country calls thee from thy shade; Behold her tears, And hear her cries: Religion fears, And Freedom dies, Amid the horrors of War's dreadful trade. Thy country groans: forego thy shade— 'Tis Honour calls thee to her aid. Chorus. Thy country groans: forego thy shade— 'Tis Honour calls thee to her aid. Recitative. The youth awoke—and starting wide, Sleep, with its vision, left his side. His soul th'idea fill'd alone; The heroick form, the piercing tone Of Honour on his memory play'd, And all his heart confess'd the heav'nly maid. Air. Sweet object of my choice, Adieu, thou calm recess! My bleeding country's voice Tears me from thy embrace. From musing water-falls, From shades and flow'ry meads, 'Tis virtuous Honour calls, And princely William leads. From all a father's love, From all a nation's care, Behold where Britain's Jove Sends forth his god of war: 'Gainst mountains cap'd with snows, 'Gainst foul Rebellion's rage The willing Hero goes Gigantick war to wage— The gen'rous heart what flow'ry scenes can please, Or tempt to waste his youth in useless ease! Chorus. The gen'rous heart what flow'ry scenes can please, Or tempt to waste his youth in useless ease! CANTATA II. The Poet. Air. Give me, indulgent Muse, to rove The mazes of thy laurel'd grove, To choose a wreath for William's brow Above Sybilla's golden bough. Recitative I walk—I wander here and there— How can I choose where all is fair? This I prefer, and that refuse— Guide me, my still-inspiring Muse. I said, and pluck'd the chosen wreath: Large drops of blood distill'd beneath; A sigh now shook the weeping tree, And thus a vocal sound Brake from the recent wound, And set the form of beauteous Daphne free. Air. Coy Daphne you behold in me; For William's sake I willing bleed. No wreath but this from Phœbus' tree Is worthy him, who Britain freed. Less fair was Phœbus' chace for unsought fame, Be his the wreath, who woo'd and won the dame. CANTATA III. The Painter. Air. Sweet mimick thou of Nature's face, Thy pencil take, thy colour spread: On thy canvas curious trace Every virtue, every grace, That hovers round our William's head. Recitative. Let Victory before him fly, And Fortitude with stedfast eye; Let Prudence with her mirrour haste, Studious of future by the past; With Industry in vigour blooming, And Science knowing much, yet less assuming. To group the piece, and swell the train, With Hydra heads Rebellion draw, Spouting at ev'ry vein The blood of thousands slain; Thousands too few to glut her rav'nous maw: Paint her panting, sinking, dying, Paint her sons at distance flying: Paint Britannia full of smiles, Scarce recover'd from her toils: Paint Justice ready to avenge her pain, Dragging the monster in her massy chain. Near her paint Mercy crown'd: soft-smiling let her stand, With arm out-stretch'd to stop her just, determin'd hand. Air. Cease to declaim, the artist cries, Of ev'ry virtue, ev'ry grace,— See, by degrees the features rise: Behold them all in William's face. CANTATA IV. The Musician. Recitative. O various power of magick strains, To damp our joys and sooth our pains! Ev'ry movement of the will Obedient owns the artist's skill. Thus in gay notes, and boastful words, The master of the tuneful chords; But soon he found his boast was air, His love still blasted with despair, And Chloe cold, or seeming cold To all the tuneful tales he told. Air. To love when he tun'd the soft lyre, It sigh'd and it trembled in vain; Tho' warm'd by his amorous fire, The fair one ne'er answer'd his strain. Recitative. Hear, cries the artist, pow'r divine, Great leader of the tuneful Nine; Teach thy votary to swell With love-inspiring strains the shell, Such as please my Chloe best, And easiest glide into her breast. Air. No more I woo in warbling strains, No more I sing the lover's pains To cold and careless ears: To warlike notes I tune the string, The song to William's praise I sing— The nymph with rapture hears. CANTATA V. The Shepherd. Recitative. Beneath an oak's indulgent shade A shepherd at his ease was laid; He pluck'd the bough, the wreath he wove Sacred to William, and to love, And taught the vocal woods around His name and Delia's to resound. Air. Of peace restor'd the shepherd sung, And plenty smiling o'er the fields; Of peace restor'd the woodlands rung, And all the sweets that quiet yields; Of love he sung and Delia's charms, And all restor'd by William's arms. Recitative. Driv'n from his native soil belov'd, By cost and care not unimprov'd, A northern swain himself betook To rest, in that sequester'd nook. One fav'rite lamb escap'd the spoil, The only meed of all his toil; Which now o'erspent he drove before, Now fondling in his bosom bore. He heard, and strait the cause requir'd, With wonder more than envy fir'd. Air. Say, swain, by what good pow'r Thou wing'st the fleeting hour, With strains that wonder move, And tell of ease and love; While I by war's alarms Am forc'd from safety's arms; From home and native air, And all their social care. Say, swain, &amp;c. Recitative. Again, replied the swain, repair To northern fields and native air; Again thy kindly home review, And all its social cares renew. Within what cave, or forest deep, To grief indulgent, or to sleep, Hast thou escap'd the gen'ral joy, Sweet gift of Britain's fav'rite Boy? Air. 'Twas William's toil this leisure gave, By him I tune my oaten reed, By him yon golden harvests wave, By him these herds in safety feed: Him shall our grateful songs declare Ever to British shepherds dear. Duet. Him shall our grateful songs declare Ever to British shepherds dear. CANTATA VI. The Religious. Recitative. Here, tyrant Superstition, ugly fiend, Harpy with an angel's face, Monster in Religion's dress, Thy impious pray'rs and bloody visions end. Hence, with thy sister Persecution, go— Hence with all her pleasing dreams Of martyrs' groans, and virgins' screams, The stretching rack, and horrid wheel, Slow fires, and consecrated steel, And ev'ry priestly implement of woe, And ev'ry threat'ned tool of hoodwink'd zeal, Ingenious Rome can find, or tortur'd Nature feel. Air. From Britain's happier clime repair To southern suns and slavish air— To empty halls, To midnight bells, To cloister'd walls, To gloomy cells Where moping Melancholy dwells— William's name shall reach you there, And sink your souls with black despair. Recitative. The Hero comes, and with him brings Fair Hope, that soars on Cherub's wings; Firm Faith attends with stedfast eye, Intent on things above the sky, To mortal ken unknown; and She, Meek and seemly, kind and free, Ever hoping, still believing, Still forbearing, still forgiving, Greatest of the heavenly Three. Air. Britons, join the godlike train, Learn, that all but Truth is vain, And to her lyre attune your joy: No gifts so pure as those she brings, No notes so sweet as those she sings, To praise the heav'nly-favour'd Boy. The Marriage of the Myrtle and the Yew. A FABLE. To DELIA, about to marry beneath herself. 1744. By the Same. A Myrtle flourish'd 'mongst the flowers, And happy pass'd her maiden hours: The lovely Rose, the garden's queen, Companion of this shrub was seen; The Lilly fair, the Violet blue, The Eglantine beside her grew: The Woodbine's arms did round her twine, With the pale genteel Jessamine: With her's the Tuberose mix'd her sweet; The flow'rs were gracious, she discreet. The envious shrub with some regret, Saw all her friends in wedlock met; Up the tall Elm the Woodbine swarms, And twines her marriageable arms; A gorgeous bower the Jess'mine chose, The glory of some ancient house; With joy she views the short-liv'd maid, The Violet, drooping in the shade; And sees (which pleas'd her to the quick) The Lilly hug a sapless stick. “And must Myrtilla still be seen “Pining in sickness ever-green? “Shall she”— With that she arm'd her brow, Which once had conquests gain'd, but now— Too old to choose, too proud to sue, Strikes flag to her good cousin Yew. This Yew was fair, and large, and good, Esteem'd a pretty stick of wood; But never in the garden plac'd, Or to be borne by nymphs of taste, But in a wilderness, or waste: And cut and clip, whate'er you do, This pretty stick was still but Yew. The pois'nous drops, the baleful shade Struck each genteeler flower dead; But Myrtle, being ever-green, Thought Nature taught to wed her kin, And careless of th'event, withdrew From her old friends, and sought her Yew. Behold the am'rous shrub transplanted, And her last prayer in vengeance granted. The bride and bridegroom cling together, Enjoy the fair, and scorn foul weather. Visits are pay'd: around are seen The scrubbed race of ever-green, Th'ill-natur'd Holly, ragged Box, And Yew's own family in flocks: But not a flow'r of scent or flavour Would do the bride so great a favour, But in contempt drew in their leaves, And shrunk away, as Sensitives. The blushing The Rose. Queen, with decent pride, Turn'd as she pass'd, her head aside; The Lilly nice, was like to spue To see Myrtilla Mrs. Yew: The Eglantine, a prude by nature, Wou'd never go a-near the Creacher; And the gay Woodbine gave a flaunt, Nor answer'd her but with a taunt. Poor Myrtle, strangely mortify'd, Too late resumes her proper pride; Which, heighten'd now by pique and spleen, Paints her condition doubly mean. She sour'd her mind, grew broken-hearted, And soon this spiteful world departed; And now lies decently interr'd, Near the old Yew in—church-yard. On a BAY-LEAF, pluck'd from Virgil's Tomb near Naples. 1736. By the same. Bold was the irreligious hand, That could all reverence withstand, And sacrilegiously presume To rob the poet's sacred tomb Of so much honourable shade, As this, so small a trophy, made; Could dare to pluck from Virgil's brow The honours Nature did bestow, Pascua.Sweetly the gentle goddess smil'd, And listen'd to her favourite child; Whether in shepherd's cleanly weed He deftly tun'd his oaten reed, And taught the vocal woods around His Amaryllis to resound; Rura.Or taught he in a graver strain To cloath the field with waving grain; And in the marriage-folds to twine The barren elm, and cluster'd vine; To yoke the lab'ring ox, to breed To the known goal the foaming steed; And sung the manners, rights, degrees, And labours of the frugal bees; Duces.Or whether with Æneas' name He swell'd th'extended cheek of Fame, And all his god-like labours sung, Whence Rome's extended glories sprung; The goddess smil'd, and own'd she knew Th'original from whence he drew, And grateful she spontaneous gave This living honour to his grave. Hail, thou sweet shade, whose rev'renc'd name Still foremost in the mouth of Fame, Doth preference and value give, And teach this little leaf to live, Methinks secluded from that brow, Where grateful Nature bad it grow, This beauteous green should fade away, And yield to iron-tooth'd decay: But Virgil's name forbids that crime, And blunts the threat'ning scythe of Time. To CHLOE. Written on my Birth-Day, 1734. By the Same. The minutes, the hours, the days, and the years, That fill up the current of Time, Neither flowing with hopes, neither ebbing with fears, Unheeded roll'd on to my prime. In infancy prattling, in youth full of play, Still pleas'd with whatever was new, I bad the old cripple fly swifter away, To o'ertake some gay trifle in view. But when Chloe, with sweetness and sense in her look, First taught me the lesson of love; Then I counted each step the wing'd fugitive took, And bad him more leisurely move. Stop, run-away, stop, nor thy journey pursue, For Chloe has gi'en me her heart: To enjoy it thy years will prove many too few, If you make so much haste to depart. Still, still he flies on—still, still let him fly 'Till he's tired, and panting for breath; My love both his teeth and his scythe shall defy— That can only be conquer'd by Death. A SONG. By the Same. Set to Musick by Dr. GREENE. [To silent groves, where weeping yew] I To silent groves, where weeping yew With sadly-mournful cypress join'd, Poor Damon from the plain withdrew, To ease with plaints his love-sick mind; Pale willow into mystick wreaths he wove, And thus lamented his forsaken love. II How often, Celia, faithless maid, With arms entwined did we walk Beneath the close unpierced shade, Beguiling time with am'rous talk! But that, alas! is past, and I must prove The pangs attending on forsaken love. III But think not, Celia, I will bear With dull submission all the smart; No, I'll at once drive out despair, And thy lov'd image from my heart: All arts, all charms I'll practise to remove The pangs attending on forsaken love. IV Bacchus, with greenest ivy crown'd, Hither repair with all thy train; And chace the jovial goblet round, For Celia triumphs in my pain: With gen'rous wine assist me to remove The pangs attending on forsaken love. V Cou'd reason be so drown'd in wine, As never to revive again, How happy were this heart of mine Reliev'd at once from all its pain! But reason still with love returns, to prove The torments lasting of forsaken love. VI Bring me the nymph, whose gen'rous soul Kindles at the circling bowl; Whose sparkling eye with wanton fire Shoots thro' my blood a fierce desire; For ev'ry art I'll practise to remove The pangs attending on forsaken love. VII And what is all this transient flame? 'Tis but a blaze, and seen no more; A blaze that lights us to our shame, And robs us of a gay four-score; Reason again with love returns, to prove The torment lasting of forsaken love. VIII Hark! how the jolly huntsman's cries, In concert with the op'ning hounds, Rend the wide concave of the skies, And tire dull Echo with their sounds: Thou Phœbe goddess of the chace, remove The pangs attending on forsaken love. IX Ah me! the sprightly-bounding doe, The chace, and every thing I view, Still to my mind recall my woe; So Celia flies, so I pursue: So rooted here, no arts can e'er remove The pangs attending on forsaken love. X Then back, poor Damon, to thy grove: Since nought avails to ease thy pain, Let constancy thy flame improve, And patience answer her disdain: So gratitude may Celia's bosom move, To pity and reward thy constant love. FASHION: A Satire. Honestius putamus, quod frequentius; recti apud nos loca tenet error, ubi publicus factus. Seneca. Yes, yes, my friend, disguise it as you will, To right or wrong 'tis Fashion guides us still; A few perhaps rise singularly good, Defy, and stem the fool o'erwhelming flood; The rest to wander from their brethren fear, As social herrings in large shoals appear. 'Twas not a taste, but pow'rful mode, that bade Yon' purblind, poking peer run picture mad; With the same wonder-gaping face he stares On flat Dutch dawbing, as on Guido's airs; What might his oak-crown'd manors mortgag'd gain? Alas! five faded landscapes of Claude Loraine. Loraine. Not so Gargilius—sleek voluptuous lord, A hundred dainties smoak upon his board; Earth, air, and ocean's ransack'd for the feast, In masquerade of foreign Olio's dress'd; Who praises, in this sauce-enamour'd age, Calm, healthful temp'rance, like an Indian sage: But could he walk in publick, were it said, “Gargilius din'd on beef, and eat brown bread?” Happy the grotto'd hermit with his pulse, Who wants no truffles, rich ragouts—nor The Physician. Hulse. How strict on Sundays gay Lætitia's face! How curl'd her hair, how clean her Brussels lace! She lifts her eyes, her sparkling eyes to heav'n, Most nun-like mourns, and hopes to be forgiv'n. Think not she prays, or is grown penitent— She went to church—because the parish went. Close Chremes, deaf to the pale widow's grief, Parts with an unsun'd guinea for relief; No meltings o'er his ruthless bosom steal, More than fierce Arabs, or proud tyrants feel; Yet, since his neighbours give, the churl unlocks, Damning the poor, his triple-bolted box. Why loves not Hippia rank obscenity? Why would she not with twenty porters lie? Why not in crowded Malls quite naked walk? Not aw'd by virtue—but “The world would talk.”— Yet how demurely looks the wishing maid, For ever, but in bed, of man afraid! Thus Lucretius, lib. 6. 848. Hammon's spring by day feels icy-cool, At night is hot as hell's sulphureous pool. Each panting warble of Vesconti's throat, To Dick, is heav'nlier than a seraph's note; The thrills, he swears, soft-stealing to his breast, Are lullabies, to sooth his cares to rest; Are sweeter far, than Laura's luscious kiss, Charm the whole man, and lap his soul in bliss: Who can such counterfeited raptures bear, Of a deaf fool who scarce can thunders hear? Crowdero might with him for Festin pass, And touching Handes yield to trifling Hasse. But curd-fac'd Curio comes! all prate, and smile, Supreme of beaux, great bulwarks of our isle! Mark well his feather'd hat, his gilt cockade, Rich rings, white hand, and coat of stiff brocade; Such weak-wing'd May-flies Britain's troops disgrace, That Flandria, wond'ring, mourns our alter'd race: With him the fair, enraptur'd with a rattle, Of Vauxhall, Garrick, or Pamela prattle: This self-pleas'd king of emptiness permit At the dear toilette harmlessly to sit; As mirthless infants, idling out the day, With wooden swords, or toothless puppies play: 'Tis meaner (cries the manling) to command A conquering host, or save a sinking land, Than furl fair Flavia's fan, or lead a dance, Or broach new-minted Fashions fresh from France. O France, whose edicts govern dress and meat, Thy victor Britain bends beneath thy feet! Strange! that pert grasshoppers should lions lead, And teach to hop, and chirp across the mead: Of fleets and laurel'd chiefs let others boast, Thy honours are to bow, dance, boil and roast. Let Italy give mimick canvas fire, Carve rock to life, or tune the lulling lyre; For gold let rich Potosi be renown'd, Be balmy-breathing gums in India found; 'Tis thine for slaves to teach the shantiest cuts, Give empty coxcombs more important struts, Prescribe new rules for knots, hoops, manteaus, wigs, Shoes, soups, complexions, coaches, farces, jigs. Muscalia dreams of last night's ball till ten, Drinks chocolate, stroaks Fop, and sleeps agen, Perhaps at twelve dares ope her drowsy eyes, Asks Lucy if 'tis late enough to rise; By three each curl and feature justly set, She dines, talks scandal, visits, plays piquette: Meanwhile her babes with some foul nurse remain, For modern dames a mother's cares disdain; Each fortnight once she bears to see the brats, “For oh they stun one's ears, like squalling cats!” Tigers and pards protect, and nurse their young, The parent-snake will roll her forked tongue, The vulture hovers vengeful o'er her nest, If the rude hand her helpless brood infest; Shall lovely woman, softest frame of heav'n, To whom were tears, and feeling pity giv'n, Most fashionably cruel, less regard Her offspring, than the vulture, snake, and pard? What art, O Fashion, pow'r supreme below! You make us virtue, nature, sense, forego; You sanctify knave, atheist, whore, and fool, And shield from justice, shame, and ridicule. Our grandames modes, long absent from our eyes, At your all-powerful bidding duteous rise; As Arethusa sunk beneath the plain For many a league, emerging flows again; Now Mary queen of Scots mobs, much worn by the ladies. Mary's mobs, and flounces you approve, Now shape-disguising sacks, and slippers love: Scarce have you chose (like Fortune fond to joke) Some reigning dress, but you the choice revoke: So when the deep-tongu'd organ's notes swell high, And loud Hosannahs reach the distant sky, Hark, how at once the dying strains decay, And soften unexpectedly away. The peer, prince, peasant, soldier, squire, divine, Goddess of Change, bend low before your shrine, Swearing to follow, wheresoe'er you lead, Tho' you eat toads, or walk upon your head. 'Tis hence belles game, intrigue, sip citron-drams, And hide their lovely locks with Têtê de Mouton, literally translated. heads of rams; Hence girls, once modest, without blush appear, With legs display'd, and swan-soft bosoms bare; Hence stale, autumnal dames, still deck'd with laces, Look like vile canker'd coins in velvet cases. Ask you, why whores live more belov'd than wives, Why weeping virtue exil'd, flattery thrives, Why mad for pensions, Britons young and old Adore base ministers, those calves of gold, Why witling templars on religion joke, Fat, rosy justices, drink, doze, and smoak, Dull criticks on best bards pour harmless spite, As babes that mumble coral, cannot bite, Why knaves malicious, brother-knaves embrace, With hearts of gall, but courtly-smiling face, Why scornful Folly from her gawdy coach, At starving houseless Virtue points reproach, Why Av'rice is the great all-worship'd God? Methinks some Dæmon answers—“'Tis the mode!” At this Corruption smiles with ghastly grin, Presaging triumphs to her mother, Sin; Who, as with baneful wings aloft she flies, “This falling land be mine!”—exulting cries; Grim Tyranny attends her on her way, And frowns, and whets his sword that thirsts to slay. Look, from the frigid to the torrid zone, By custom all are led, by nature none. The following facts are taken from the accounts of different countries.The hungry Tartar rides upon his meat, To cook the dainty flesh with buttock's heat: The Chinese complaisantly takes his bed With his big wife, and is with cawdle fed. How would our tender British beauties shriek, To see slim beaux on bulls their lances break! Yet not Lucinda, in heroic Spain, Admits a youth, but who his beast has slain. See, wond'rous lands, where the fell victor brings, To his glad wives, the heads of slaughter'd kings, The mangled heads!—o'er which they sing and laugh, And in dire banquets the warm life-blood quaff; Where youths their grandsires, age-bent, trembling, grey, Pitying their weary weakness, kindly slay: Where sainted Brachmans, sick of life, retire, To die spontaneous on the spicy pyre; Where (stranger still!) with their wild dates content, The simple swains no sighs for gold torment. How fondly partial are our judgments grown, We deem all manners odious, but our own! O teach me, friend, to know wise Nature's rules, And laugh, like you, at Fashion's hoodwink'd fools; You, who to woods remov'd from modish sin, Despise the distant world's hoarse, busy din; As shepherds from high rocks hear far below, Hear unconcern'd loud torrents fiercely flow; You, tho' mad millions the mean taste upbraid, Who still love Virtue, fair, forsaken maid; As Bacchus charming Ariadne bore, By all abandon'd, from the lonesome shore. NATURE and FORTUNE. To the Earl of Chesterfield. Nature and fortune blith and gay, To pass an hour or two, In frolick mood agreed to play At “What shall this man do?” Come, I'll be judge then, Fortune cries, And therefore must be blind; Then whipt a napkin round her eyes, And ty'd it fast behind. Nature had now prepar'd her list Of names on scraps of leather, Which roll'd, she gave them each a twist, And husled them together. Thus mixt, which ever came to hand She very surely drew; Then bade her sister give command, For what that man should do. 'Twould almost burst one's sides to hear What strange commands she gave; That C?r should the laurel wear, And C?e an army have. At length when Stanhope's name was come, Dame Nature smil'd and cry'd, Now tell me, sister, this man's doom, And what shall him betide? That man, said Fortune, shall be one Blest both by you and me:— Nay, then, quoth Nature, let's have done; Sister, I'm sure you see. The EXCEPTION. Stanpope has gain'd one branch of fame, To which, I'll prove, he has no claim. Say they—“His favours he extends, “Without regard to wealth, or friends: “Of such disinterested spirit, “Nothing prevails, with him, but merit; “Nay, he'll dispense with merit too, “When modest want can reach his view.” Mere prejudice! 'tis plain to me, No man takes sweeter bribes than he. To clear this point from any doubt, A parallel shall help me out. The noble Fulvia spurns at gain: Freely she heals her lover's pain: But, surely, you'll allow me this, That when she grants, she shares the bliss. So Stanhope, in each gen'rous action, Reaps more than half the satisfaction. To the Earl of CHESTERFIELD. Can ease be consistent with state? Can freedom and pomp thus agree? O Stanhope, who wou'd not be great, If easy in greatness like thee? Let statesmen pretend to despise Those talents that furnish delight, 'Tis Stanhope's alone to be wise, Yet pleasure with wisdom unite. State burthens with form the gay soul, Unbended alone we taste joy. Too soon our grey hairs must controul That bliss which our prime should employ. Then, Stanhope, be blest in your choice, Be happy your life in each stage; While spirits attend you rejoice, You've wisdom enough for old age. HONOUR. A Poem. By the Rev. Dr. BROWN. Inscribed to the Right Hon. the Lord Visc. Lonsdale. Hic Manus ob Patriam pugnando vulnera passi; Quique Sacerdotes casti dum vita manebat; Quique pii Vates, &amp; Phœbo digna locuti, Inventas aut qui Vitam excoluere per Artes, Quique sui memores alios fecere merendo; Omnibus his nivea cinguntur Tempora vitta. Vir. Æn. 6. ? Who shall go about To couzen Fortune, and be honourable Without the Stamp of Merit? Shakespear. Yes: all, my Lord, usurp fair Honour's fame: Verse 1, &amp;c. The various and ridiculous pretensions of mankind to Honour and Fame enumerated. Tho' false as various be the boasted claim: Th'ambitious miser swells his boundless store, And dreads that highest scandal, to be poor; His wiser heir derides the dotard's aim, And bids profusion bribe him into fame. Oft' Honour, perching on the ribbon'd breast, Sneers at weak justice, and defies th'arrest; She dwells exulting on the tongues of kings; She wakes the Muse to flight, and plumes her wings; The soldier views her in the shining blade; The pedant 'midst the lumber in his head. She to fell Treason the disguise can lend, And sheath her sword remorseless in a friend: Her throne's fantastick pride, we often see Rear'd on the tombs of Truth and Honesty; Fops, templars,—courtiers, slaves,—cheats, patriots,—all Pretend to hear, and to obey the call. Where fix we then?—Each boasting thus his own, Say, does true Honour dwell with all, or none? The truth, my Lord, is clear:—tho' impious pride Ver. 21. Tho' they are thus inconstant and contradictory, yet true Honour is a thing fixed and determinate. Is ever self-ador'd, self-deify'd; Though fools by passion or self-love betray'd, Fall down and worship what themselves have made; Still does the Goddess, in her form divine, O'er each grim idol eminently shine; Array'd in lasting majesty, is known Thro' every clime and age, unchang'd, and One. But how explor'd?—Take reason for your guide, Verse 29. If we would form an impartial judgment of what is truly honourable, we must abstract all considerations which regard ourselves. Discard self-love; set passion's glass aside; Nor view her with the jaundic'd eye of pride. Yet judge not rashly from a partial view Verse 32. Not only so, but we must remove ourselves to a proper distance from the object we examine, lest some part should predominate in our eye, and occasion a false judgment of the whole. Of what is wrong or right, or false or true; Objects too near deceive th'observer's eye; Examine those which at a distance lie. Scarce is the structure's harmony descry'd 'Midst the tall column's, and gay order's pride; But tow'rds the destin'd point your sight remove, And this shall lessen still, and that improve, New beauties gain upon your wond'ring eyes, And the fair Whole in just proportions rise. Thus Honour's true proportions best are seen, Where the due length of ages lies between: This separates pride from greatness, show from worth, Detects false beauty, real grace calls forth; Points out what merits praise, what merits blame, Sinks in disgrace, or rises into fame. Come then, from past examples let us prove Verse 48. Therefore the surest method is, to prove by past examples what commands our love and esteem. What raises hate, contempt, esteem, or love. Can greatness give true Honour? can expence? Verse 50, &amp;c. Expence and grandeur cannot give true Honour: Their most splendid monuments vanish; and even should they last for ever, could not bestow real glory, if only the records of Pride, Tyranny, and Vice. Can luxury? or can magnificence? Wild is the purpose, and the fruitless aim, Like a vile prostitute to bribe fair Fame; Persuasive splendor vainly tempts her ear, And e'en all-potent gold is baffled here. Ye pyramids, that once could threat the skies, Aspiring tow'rs, and cloud-wrapt wonders, rise! To latest age your founder's pride proclaim; Record the tyrant's greatness; tell his name; No more:—The treacherous brick and mould'ring stone Are sunk in dust: the boasting title gone: Pride's trophies swept by Time's devouring flood, Th'inscription want, to tell where once they stood. But could they rival Nature, Time defy, Yet what record but Vice or Vanity? His the true glory, tho' his name unknown, Who taught the arch to swell; to rise, the stone; Not his, whose wild command fair art obey'd, Whilst folly dictated, or passion sway'd. No: spite of greatness, pride and vice are seen, Shameful in pomp, conspicuously mean. In vain, O St?d?y, thy proud forests spread; Verse 72, &amp;c. Much less if purchas'd by Oppression and Guilt. In vain each gilded turret rears its head; In vain thy Lord commands the streams to fall, Extends the view, and spreads the smooth canal, While guilt's black train each conscious walk invade, And cries of orphans haunt him in the shade. Mistaken man! by crimes to hope for fame? Thy imag'd glory leads to real shame: Is villainy self-hated? thus to raise Upbraiding monuments of soul disgrace? Succeeding times, and ages yet unborn, Shall view the guilty scenes with honest scorn; Disdain each beauty thy proud folly plann'd, And curse the labours of oppression's hand. Next, view the Heroe in th'embattled field: Verse 86, &amp;c. True Honour is not to be reaped from unjust Conquest: It is not Victory, but a just Cause that can engage our esteem. True Honour's fruit can conquest's laurel yield? Him only honour'd, only lov'd we find, Who fights not to destroy, but save mankind: Pelides' fury may our wonder move, But god-like Hector is the man we love. See William's sword a tyrant's pride disarm: See Lewis trembling under Marlb'ro's arm: Say, which to human kind are friends or foes; And who detests not These, and loves not Those? Conquest unjust can ne'er command applause; 'Tis not the vict'ry charms you, but the cause: Not Cæsar's self can feign the patriot's part, Nor his false virtues hide his poison'd heart: But round thy brows the willing laurels twine, Whose voice wak'd freedom in the savage mine! Yes: truly glorious, only great is he, Who conquers, or who bleeds for liberty. “Heroes are much the same, the point's agreed, “From Macedonia's mad-man to the Swede. Like baleful comets flaming in the skies, At destin'd times th'appointed scourges rise; A while in streaming lustre sweep along, And fix in wonder's gaze th'admiring throng; But reason's eye detects the spurious ray, And the false blaze of glory dies away. Now all th'aërial cells of wit explore; The mazy rounds of science travel o'er; Search all the deep recesses of the mind, And see, if there true Honour sits enshrin'd. Alas, nor wit nor science this can boast, Verse 116. Neither is true glory to be obtain'd by wit or Science: They are chimerical: Sometimes attended with folly, and weakness; often stain'd with vice, and so render their possessors mischievous and infamous. Of't dash'd with error, oft' in caprice lost! Transient as bright the short-liv'd bubbles fly! And modes of wit, and modes of science die. See Rab'lais once the idol of the age; Yet now neglected lies the smutted page! Of once renown'd Des Cartes how low the fall,— His glory with his whirlpools vanish all! See folly, wit—and weakness, wisdom stain,— And Villars witty—Bacon wise in vain! Oft' vice corrupts what sense and parts refine, And clouds the splendor of the brightest line, Sullies what Congreve, and what Dryden writ,— This, fashion's slave; as that, the slave of wit. In vain fair Genius bids the laurel shoot, The deadly worm thus eating at the root: Corroded thus, the greenest wreaths decay, And all the poet's honours fall away; Quick as autumnal leaves, the laurels fade, And drop on Rochester's and Otway's head. Where then is found True Honour, heavenly fair? Ask, Lonsdale, ask your heart—she dictates there. Yes: 'tis in Virtue:—That alone can give Verse 138. The foundation of true Honour is Virtue only. The lasting honour, and bid glory live: On virtue's basis only fame can rise, To stand the storms of age, and reach the skies: Arts, conquest, greatness, feel the stroke of fate, Shrink sudden, and betray th'incumbent weight; Time with contempt the faithless props surveys, “And buries madmen in the heaps they raise.” 'Tis Virtue only can the bard inspire, And fill his raptur'd breast with lasting fire: Touch'd by th'etherial ray each kindled line Beams strong: still Virtue feeds the flame divine; Where'er she treads she leaves her footsteps bright, In radiant tracts of never-dying light; These shed the lustre o'er each sacred name, Give Spenser's clear, and Shakespear's noble flame; Verse 153. It is Virtue only that gives the poet lasting glory: this proved by instances. Blaze to the skies in Milton's ardent song, And kindle the brisk-sallying fire of Young; These gild each humble verse in modest Gay; These give to Swift the keen, soul-piercing ray; Mildly thro' Addison's chaste page they shine, And glow and warm in Pope's immortal line. Nor less the sage must live by Virtue's aid; Truth must support him, or his glories fade; And truth and virtue differ but in name: Like light and heat—distinguish'd, yet the same. To truth and virtue the ascent is sure; Verse 164. The philosopher can only hope for true glory from the same source; because Truth is his object, and nothing can be Truth that tends to destroy Virtue and Happiness. The wholesome stream implies the fountain pure; To taste the spring we oft' essay in vain: Deep lies the source, too short is reason's chain; But those the issues of pure truth we know, Which in clear strength thro' virtue's channel flow: Error in vain attempts the foul disguise, Still tasted in the bitter wave of vice; Drawn from the springs of Falsehood all confess Each baleful drop that poisons happiness; G?rd?n's thin shallows, The Work here characterized is entitled, “The Independent Whig, or a Defence of our ecclesiastical Establishment:” yet it may be truly affirmed, that there is not one institution of the Church of England, but what is there misrepresented, and ridiculed with the lowest and most despicable scurrility.

Hence appears the madness, infamy, and falsehood of those destructive schemes set on foot by the sect called Freethinkers. And Morgan's His character is thus drawn by an excellent writer—“Who by the peculiar felicity of a good choice, having learned his Morality of our Tindal, and his Philosophy of your [the Jews] Spinoza, calls himself, by the courtesy of England, a Moral Philosopher.” Warb.

The Author of that monstrous heap of contradiction and absurdity, “The Fable of the Bees, or private Vices publick Benefits.” The reader who is acquainted with the writings of those Gentlemen, will probably observe a kind of climax in this place; ascending from those who have attempted to destroy the several fences of virtue, to the wild boars of the wood that root it up. Detested names! yet sentenc'd ne'er to die; Snatch'd from oblivion's grave by infamy! Insect-opinions, hatch'd by folly's ray, Verse 180. Falsehood short-lived: Truth eternal.

See, how the lustre of th'Athenian Socrates. sage Verse 184, &amp;c. Examples of the two most illustrious philosophers that ever adorned the world; the one excellent in moral, the other in natural knowledge. Shines thro' the lengthen'd gloom of many an age! Virtue alone so wide the beam cou'd spread, And throw the lasting glory round his head. See Newton chase conjecture's twilight ray, And light up nature into certain day! He wide creation's trackless mazes trod; And in each atom found the ruling God. Unrival'd pair! with truth and virtue fraught! Whose lives confirm'd whate'er their reason taught! Whose far-stretch'd views, and bright examples join'd At once t'enlighten and persuade mankind! Hail names rever'd! which time and truth proclaim The first and fairest in the list of fame. Kings, statesmen, patriots, thus to glory rise; Verse 198, &amp;c. Kings, statesmen, and patriots, must build their fame on Virtue. On virtue grows their fame, or soon it dies; But grafted on the vigorous stock, 'tis seen Brighten'd by age, and springs in endless green: Pride, folly, vice may blossom for an hour, Fed by court-sun-shine, and poetick show'r; But the pale tendrils, nurs'd by flattery's hand, Verse 204. Flattery cannot raise folly or vice into true glory. Unwearied tendance, fresh supplies demand; By heats unnatural push'd to sudden growth, They sicken at th'inclement blasts of truth; Shook by the weakest breath that passes by, Their colours fade, they wither, droop, and die. 'Tis Virtue only that shall grow with time, Live thro' each age, and spread thro' every clime. See god-like patriots, gen'rous, wise, and good, Stand in the breach, and stem corruption's flood! See martyr-bishops The catalogue of these heroes, through the several ages of Christianity, is too large to be inserted in a work of this nature: Those of our own Country were Ridley, Latimer, and the good (tho' less fortunate) Cranmer. at the stake expire, Smile on the faggot, and defy its fire! How great in exile Hyde and Tully shone! How Alfred's virtues brighten'd all his throne! From worth like this unbidden glories stream; Nor borrow'd blaze it asks, nor fortune's beam; Affliction's gloom but makes it still more bright, As the clear lamp shines clearest in the night. Thus various honours various states adorn, Verse 222. Thus it appears that every one has the power of obtaining true honour, by promoting the happiness of mankind in his proper station. As different stars with different glories burn; Their orbs too wider, as their sphere is higher; Yet all partake the seme celestial fire. See then heav'n's endless bounty, and confess, Verse 226. And thus the love of fame, tho' often perverted to bad ends, is naturally conducive to virtue and happiness. Which gives in Virtue fame and happiness! See mankind's folly, who the boon despise, And grasp at pain and infamy in Vice! Not so the man who mov'd by Virtue's laws, Verse 230, &amp;c. True honour characteriz'd and exemplify'd. Reveres himself—and gains, not seeks applause; Whose views concenter'd all to Virtue tend; Who makes true glory but his second end: Sitll sway'd by what is fit, and just, and true, Who gives to all whate'er to all is due; When parties mad sedition's garb put on, Snatches the highest praise,—and is of none: Whilst round and round the veering patriots roll, Unshaken points to Truth, as to his pole; Contemns-alike what factions praise or blame; O'er rumour's narrow orbit soars to fame: Unmov'd whilst malice barks, or envy howls, Walks firm to virtue through the scoffs of fools; No minion flatters; gains no selfish end; His own—his king's—his country's—mankind's friend;— Him Virtue crowns with wreaths that ne'er decay; And glory circles him with endless day. Such he who deep in Virtue roots his fame; And such thro' ages shall be Lonsdale's name. ODE to a Water Nymph. By Mr. Mason. Ye green-hair'd nymphs! whom Pan allows To tend this sweetly-solemn A seat near ? finely situated with a great command of water, but disposed in a very false taste, which gave occasion to this Ode. Wood, To speed the shooting scions into boughs, And call the roseate blossoms from the bud; But chief, thou Naid, wont so long to lead This fluid crystal sparkling as it flows; Whither, ah! whither art thou fled? What shade is conscious to thy woes? Ah! 'tis yon poplar's aweful gloom; Poetick eyes can pierce the scene, Can see thy drooping head, thy with'ring bloom, See grief diffus'd o'er all thy languid mien. Well may'st thou wear misfortune's fainting air, Well rend those flow'ry honours from thy brow, Devolve that length of careless hair, And give yon azure veil to flow Loose to the wind. For ah! thy pain The pitying Muse can well relate: Ah! let her, plaintive, pour the tend'rest strain, To teach the Echoes thy disastrous fate. 'Twas where the alder's close-knit shade entwin'd (What time the dog-star's fires intensely burn,) In gentlest indolence reclin'd, Beside your ever-trickling urn You slept serene; all free from fears, No friendly dream foretold your harm, When sudden, see! the tyrant Art appears To snatch the liquid treasures from thy arm. Art, Gothick Art, has seiz'd thy darling vase, That vase which silver-slipper'd Thetis gave, For some soft story told with grace, Amid th'associates of the wave; When in sequester'd coral vales, While worlds of waters roll'd above, The circling sea-nymphs told alternate tales Of fabled changes, and of slighted love. Ah! loss too justly mourn'd! for now the fiend Has on yon shell-wrought terras pois'd it high, And thence he bids its streams descend, With torturing regularity; From step to step with sullen sound The forc'd cascades indignant leap, Till pent they fill the bason's measur'd round, There in a dull stagnation doom'd to sleep. Lost is the vocal pebble's gurgling song, The rill soft-dripping from its rocky spring, No free meander winds along, Or curls, when Zephyr waves his wing, These charms, alas! are now no more— Fortune, oh! give me to redeem The ravish'd vase; oh! give me to restore Its pristine honours to this hapless stream! Then, Nymph, again, with all their native ease, Thy wanton waters, volatile and free, Shall wildly warble, as they please, Their soft loquacious harmony. Where-e'er they vagrant chuse to rove, There will I lead, not force their way, Whether to gloom beneath the shady grove, Or in the mead reflect the sparkling ray. Not Hagley's various stream shall thine surpass, Tho' Nature, and her Lyttelton ordain That there the Naid band shou'd grace With ev'ry watry charm the plain; That there the frequent rills shou'd roll, And health to ev'ry flow'r dispense, Free as their master pours from all his soul The gen'rous tide of warm benevolence; Shou'd now glide sweetly plaintive thro' the vale In melting murmurs querulously slow; Soft as that master's love-lorn tale, When Lucy calls forth all his woe: Shou'd now from steepy heights descend, Deep thund'ring the rough rocks among, Loud as the praise applauding senates lend, When England's cause inspires his glowing tongue. MUSÆUS: A MONODY TO THE Memory of Mr. POPE. In Imitation of Milton's Lycidas. By the Same. Sorrowing I catch the reed, and call the Muse; If yet a Muse on Britain's plain abide, Since rapt Musæus tun'd his parting strain: With him they liv'd, with him perchance they dy'd. For who e'er since their virgin train espy'd, Or on the banks of Thames, or that mild plain, Where Isis sparkles to the sunny ray? Or have they deign'd to play, Where Camus winds along his broider'd vale, Feeding each white pink, and each daisie pied, That mingling paint his rushy-fringed side? Yet ah! celestial maids, ye are not dead; Immortal as ye are, ye may not die: And well I ween, ye cannot quite be fled, Ere ye entune his mournful elegy. Stay then awhile, O stay, ye fleeting fair; Revisit yet, nor hallow'd Hippocrene, Nor Thespia's shade; till your harmonious teen Be grateful pour'd on some slow-ditted air, Such tribute paid, again ye may repair To what lov'd haunt you whilom did erect; Whether Lycæus, or that mountain fair Trim Mænelaus, with piny verdure deck'd. But now it boots you not in these to stray, Or yet Cyllene's hoary shade to chuse, Or where mild Ladon's swelling waters play. Forego each vain excuse, And haste to Thames's shores; for Thames shall join Our sad society, and passing mourn, Letting cold tears bedew his silver urn. And, when the poet's wither'd grot he laves, His reed-crown'd locks shall shake, his head shall bow, His tide no more in eddies blithe shall rove, But creep soft by with long-drawn murmurs slow. For oft the poet rous'd his charmed waves With martial notes, or lull'd with strains of love. He must not now in brisk meanders flow Gamefome, and kiss the sadly-silent shore, Without the loan of some poetick woe. Can I forget, how erst his osiers made Sad sullen musick, as bleak Eurus fann'd? Can I forget, how gloom'd yon laureat shade, Ere death remorseless wav'd his ebon wand? How, midst yon grot, each silver-trickling spring Wander'd the shelly channels all among; While as the coral roof did softly ring Reponsive to their sweetly-doleful song? Meanwhile all pale th'expiring poet laid, And sunk his aweful head, While vocal shadows pleasing dreams prolong: For so, his sick'ning spirits to release, They pour'd the balm of visionary peace. First, sent from Cam's fair banks, like Palmer old, Came i. e. Chaucer, a name frequently given him by Spenser. Vide Shep. Cal. Ecl. 2. 6. 12. and elsewhere. Tityrus slow, with head all silver'd o'er, And in his hand an oaken crook he bore, And thus in antique guise short talk did hold. “Grete clerk of Fame' is house, whose excellence “Maie wele befitt thilk place of eminence, “Mickle of wele betide thy houres last, “For mich gode wirkè to me don and past. “For syn the daies whereas my lyre ben strongen, “And deftly many a mery laie I songen, “Old Time, which alle things don maliciously, “Gnawen with rusty tooth continually, “Gnattrid my lines, that they all cancrid ben, “Till at the last thou smoothen 'hem hast again; “Sithence full semely gliden my rhymes rude, “As, (if fitteth thilk similitude) “Whannè shallow brooke yrenneth hobling on, “Ovir rough stones it maken full rough song: “But, them stones removen, this lite rivere “Stealen forth by, making pleasant murmere: “So my sely rhymes, whoso may them note, “Thou maken everichone to ren right sote; “And in my verse entuneth so fetisely, “That men sayen I make trewe melody, “And speaken every dele to myne honoure, “Mich wele, grete clerk, betide thy parting houre!” He ceas'd his homely rhyme.

I. “ The two first stanzas of this speech, as they relate to Pastoral, are written in the measure which Spenser uses in the first eclogue of the Shepherd's Calendar; the rest, where he speaks of Fable, are in the stanza of the Faery Queen.Ah! luckless swain, alas! how art thou lorn, “Who once like me could'st frame thy pipe to play “Sbepherds devise, and chear the ling'ring morn: “Ne bush, ne breere, but learnt thy roundelay. “Ah plight too sore such worth to equal right! “Ah worth too high to meet such piteous plight!

Thyrsis hight by Dryad, Fawn, or Swain, Whene'er he mingled with the sylvan train; But seldom that; for higher thoughts he fed; For him full oft the heav'nly Muses led To clear Euphrates, and the secret mount, To Araby, and Eden, fragrant climes; All which the sacred bard would oft recount: And thus in strain, unus'd in grove or shade, To sad Musæus rightful homage paid. “Thrice hail, thou heav'n-taught warbler, last and best “Of all the train!

Wond'rous this, yet here “The wonder rests not; various argument “Remains for me, all doubting, where to cull “The primal grace, where countless graces charm. “Various this peaceful scene, this mineral roof; “This 'semblance meet of coral, ore, and shell; “These pointed crystals fair, 'mid each obscure “Bright glist'ring; all these slowly-dripping rills, “That tinkling stray amid the cooly cave. “Yet not this various peaceful scene; with this “Its mineral roof; nor this assemblage meet “Of coral, ore, and shell; nor 'mid th'obscure “These pointed crystals, glist'ring fair; nor rills, “That straying tinkle thro' the cooly cave; “Deal charms more various to each raptur'd sense, “Than thy mellifluous lay—” “Cease, friendly swain; (Musæus cry'd, and rais'd his aching head) “All praise is foreign, but of true desert; “Plays round the head, but comes not to the heart. “Ah! why recall the toys of thoughtless youth? “When flow'ry fiction held the place of truth: “When fancy rul'd; when trill'd each trivial strain, “But idly sweet, and elegantly vain. “O! in that strain, if all of wit had flow'd, “All musick warbled, and all beauty glow'd; “Had liveliest nature, happiest art combin'd, “That lent each grace, and this each grace refin'd; “Alas! how little were my proudest boast! “The sweetest trifler of my tribe at most. “To sway the judgment, while he charms the ear: “To curb mad passion in its wild career; “To blend with skill, as loftiest themes inspire, “All reason's rigour, and all fancy's fire; “Be this the poet's praise; with this uncrown'd, “Wit dies a jest, and poetry a sound. “Come then that honest fame; whose sober ray “Or gilds the satire, or the moral lay, “Which dawns, tho' thou, rough Donne! hew out the line, “But beams, sage Horace, from each strain of thine. “O! if, like these, one poet more could brave “The venal statesman, or the titled slave; “Brand frontless Vice, strip all her stars and strings, “Nor spare her basking in the smile of kings: “Yet stoop to Virtue, tho' the prostrate maid “Lay sadly pale in bleak misfortune's shade: “If grave, yet lively; rational, yet warm; “Clear to convince, and eloquent to charm; “He pour'd, for her lov'd cause, serene along “The purest precept, in the sweetest song: “For her lov'd cause, he trac'd his moral plan, “Yon various region of bewild'ring man; “Explor'd alike each scene, that frown'd or smil'd, “The flow'ry garden, or the weedy wild; “Unmov'd by sophistry, unaw'd by name, “No dupe to doctrines, and no fool to fame; “Led by no system's devious glare astray, “As earth-born meteors glitter to betray: “But all his soul to reason's rule resign'd, “And heav'n's own views fair op'ning on his mind, “Catch'd from bright nature's flame the living ray, “Thro' passion's cloud pour'd in resistless day; “And this great truth in all its lustre shew'd, “That God is wise, and all Creation good: “If this his boast, pour here the welcome lays: “Praise less than this, is impotence of praise.” “To pour that praise be mine,” fair Virtue cry'd, And shot all radiant, thro' an op'ning cloud. But ah! my Muse, how will thy voice express Th'immortal strain, harmonious, as it flow'd? Ill suits immortal strain a dorick dress: And far too high already hast thou soar'd. Enough for thee, that, when the lay was o'er, The goddess clasp'd him to her throbbing breast. But what might that avail? Blind Fate before Had op'd her shears, to slit his vital thread; And who may hope gainsay her stern behest? Then thrice he wav'd the hand, thrice bow'd the head, And sigh'd his soul to rest. Then wept the Nymphs; witness, ye waving shades! Witness, ye winding streams! the Nymphs did weep; The heav'nly Goddess too with tears did steep Her plaintive voice, that echo'd thro' the glades; And, “cruel gods,” and “cruel stars,” she cry'd: Nor did the shepherds, thro' the woodlands wide, On that sad day, or to the pensive brook, Or stagnant river, drive their thirsty flocks; Nor did the wild-goat brouze the steepy rocks; And Philomel her custom'd oak forsook; And roses wan were wav'd by zephyrs weak, As Nature's self was sick; And every lilly droop'd its velvet head; And groan'd each faded lawn, and leafless grove; Sad sympathy! yet sure his rightful meed, Who charm'd all nature: well might Nature mourn Thro' all her sweets; and flow'r, and lawn, and shade, All vocal grown, all weep Musæus dead. Here end we, Goddess: this your shepherd sang, All as his hands an ivy chaplet wove. O! make it worthy of the sacred bard, And make it equal to the shepherd's love. Nor thou, Musæus, from thine ear discard, For well I ween thou hear'st my doleful song; Whether 'mid angel troops, the stars among, From golden harps thou call'st seraphick lays; Or, anxious for thy dearest Virtue's fare, Thou still art hov'ring o'er her tuneless sphere, And mov'st some hidden spring her weal to raise. Thus the fond swain on dorick oate essay'd, Manhood's prime honours downing on his cheek: Trembling he strove to court the tuneful maid With stripling arts, and dalliance all too weak; Unseen, unheard, beneath an hawthorn shade. But now dun clouds the welkin 'gan to streak; And now down-dropt the larks, and ceas'd their strain: They ceas'd, and with them ceas'd the shepherd swain. AN ESSAY ON SATIRE, Occasioned by the Death of Mr. POPE. Inscribed to Dr. WARBURTON. By JOHN BROWN, D. D, O while along the stream of Time thy Name Expanded flies, and gathers all its fame; Say, shall my little barque attendant sail, Pursue the triumph, and partake the gale? PART I. Fate gave the word; the cruel arrow sped; And Pope lies number'd with the mighty dead! Resign'd he fell superior to the dart, That quench'd its rage in Yours and Britain's heart: You mourn: but Britain, lull'd in rest profound, (Unconscious Britain!) slumbers o'er her wound. Exulting Dulness ey'd the setting light, And flapp'd her wing, impatient for the night: Rous'd at the signal, Guilt collects her train, And counts the triumphs of her growing reign: With inextinguishable rage they burn, And snake-hung Envy hisses o'er his urn: Th'envenom'd monsters spit their deadly foam, To blast the laurel that surrounds his tomb. But You, O Warburton! whose eye refin'd Can see the greatness of an honest mind; Can see each virtue and each grace unite, And taste the raptures of a pure delight; You visit oft' his aweful page with care, And view that bright assemblage treasur'd there; You trace the chain that links his deep design, And pour new lustre on the glowing line. Yet deign to hear the efforts of a Muse, Whose eye, not wing, his ardent flight pursues; Intent from this great archetype to draw Satire's bright form, and fix her equal law; Pleas'd if from hence th'unlearn'd may comprehend, And reverence His and Satire's generous end. In ev'ry breast there burns an active flame, The love of glory, or the dread of shame: The passion One, tho' various it appear, As brighten'd into hope, or dimm'd by fear. The lisping infant, and the hoary sire, And youth and manhood feel the heart-born fire; The charms of praise the coy, the modest wooe, And only fly, that glory may pursue: She, pow'r resistless, rules the wise and great; Bends ev'n reluctant hermits at her feet: Haunts the proud city, and the lowly shade, And sways alike the scepter and the spade. Thus heav'n in pity wakes the friendly flame, To urge mankind on deeds that merit fame: But man, vain man, in folly only wise, Rejects the manna sent him from the skies: With rapture hears corrupted passion's call, Still proudly prone to mingle with the stall. As each deceitful shadow tempts his view, He for the imag'd substance quits the true: Eager to catch the visionary prize, In quest of glory plunges deep in vice; Till madly zealous, impotently vain, He forfeits ev'ry praise he pants to gain. Thus still imperious Nature plies her part; And still her dictates work in ev'ry heart. Each pow'r that sov'reign Nature bids enjoy, Man may corrupt, but man can ne'er destroy. Like mighty rivers, with resistless force The passions rage, obstructed in their course; Swell to new heights, forbidden paths explore, And drown those virtues which they fed before. And sure, the dreadliest foe to virtue's flame, Our worst of evils, is perverted shame. Beneath this load what abject numbers groan, Th'entangled slaves to folly not their own! Meanly by fashionable fear oppress'd, We seek our virtues in each other's breast; Blind to ourselves, adopt each foreign vice, Another's weakness, interest, or caprice. Each fool to low ambition, poorly great, That pines in splendid wretchedness of state, Tir'd in the treach'rous chase, wou'd nobly yield, And but for shame, like Sylla, quit the field: The dæmon Shame paints strong the ridicule, And whispers close “the world will call you fool.” Behold, yon wretch, by impious fashion driv'n, Believes and trembles while he scoffs at heav'n. By weakness strong, and bold thro' fear alone, He dreads the sneer by shallow coxcombs thrown; Dauntless pursues the path Spinoza trod; To man a coward, and a brave to God. Faith, Justice, heav'n itself now quit their hold, When to false fame the captiv'd heart is sold: Hence blind to truth, relentless Cato dy'd: Nought cou'd subdue his virtue, but his pride. Hence chaste Lucretia's innocence betray'd Fell by that honour which was meant its aid. Thus Virtue sinks beneath unnumber'd woes, When passions born her friends, revolt, her foes. Hence Satire's pow'r: 'tis her corrective part To calm the wild disorders of the heart. She points the arduous height where glory lies, And teaches mad ambition to be wise: In the dark bosom wakes the fair desire, Draws good from ill, a brighter flame from fire; Strips black Oppression of her gay disguise, And bids the hag in native horror rise; Strikes tow'ring pride and lawless rapine dead, And plants the wreath on Virtue's aweful head. Nor boasts the Muse a vain imagin'd pow'r, Tho' oft she mourn those ills she cannot cure. The worthy court her, and the worthless fear; Who shun her piercing eye, that eye revere. Her aweful voice the vain and vile obey, And every foe to wisdom feel her sway. Smarts, pedants, as she smiles, no more are vain; Desponding fops resign the clouded cane: Hush'd at her voice, pert Folly's self is still, And Dulness wonders while she drops her quill. Alluding to these lines of Mr. Pope; In the nice bee what art so subtly true, From pois'nous herbs extracts a healing dew.Like the arm'd Bee, with art most subtly true From pois'nous Vice she draws a healing dew: Weak are the ties that civil arts can find, To quell the ferment of the tainted mind: Cunning evades, securely wrapt in wiles; And Force strong-sinew'd rends th'unequal toils: The stream of vice impetuous drives along, Too deep for policy, for pow'r too strong. Ev'n fair Religion, native of the skies, Scorn'd by the crowd, seeks refuge with the wise; The crowd with laughter spurns her aweful train, And Mercy courts, and Justice frowns in vain. But Satire's shaft can pierce the harden'd breast: She plays a ruling passion on the rest: Undaunted mounts the battery of his pride, And awes the Brave, that earth and heav'n defy'd. When fell Corruption, by her vassals crown'd, Derides fall'n Justice prostrate on the ground; Swift to redress an injur'd people's groan, Bold Satire shakes the tyrant on her throne; Pow'rful as death, defies the sordid train, And slaves and sycophants surround in vain. But with the friends of Vice, the foes of Satire, All truth is spleen; all just reproof, ill-nature. Well may they dread the Muse's fatal skill; Well may they tremble when she draws her quill: Her magick quill, that like Ithuriel's spear Reveals the cloven hoof, or lengthen'd ear: Bids Vice and Folly take their natural shapes, Turns duchesses to strumpets, beaux to apes; Drags the vile whisperer from his dark abode, Till all the dæmon starts up from the toad. O sordid maxim, form'd to screen the vile, That true good-nature still must wear a smile! In frowns array'd her beauties stronger rise, When love of virtue wakes her scorn of vice: Where justice calls, 'tis cruelty to save; And 'tis the law's good-nature hangs the knave. Who combats Virtue's foe is Virtue's friend; Then judge of Satire's merit by her end: To guilt alone her vengeance stands confin'd, The object of her love is all mankind. Scarce more the friend of man, the wise must own, Ev'n Allen's bounteous hand, than Satire's frown: This to chastise, as that to bless, was giv'n; Alike the faithful ministers of heav'n. Oft' on unfeeling hearts the shaft is spent: Tho' strong th'example, weak the punishment. They least are pain'd, who merit Satire most; Folly the Laureat's, Vice was Chartres' boast; Then where's the wrong, to gibbet high the name Of fools and knaves already dead to shame? Oft' Satire acts the faithful surgeon's part; Generous and kind, tho' painful is her art: With caution bold, she only strikes to heal, Tho' folly raves to break the friendly steel. Then sure no fault impartial Satire knows, Kind, ev'n in vengeance kind, to Virtue's foes. Whose is the crime, the scandal too be theirs: The knave and fool are their own libellers. PART II. Dare nobly then: but conscious of your trust, As ever warm and bold, be ever just: Nor court applause in these degenerate days: The villain's censure is extorted praise. But chief, be steady in a noble end, And shew mankind that truth has yet a friend. 'Tis mean for empty praise of wit to write, As foplings grin to show their teeth are white: To brand a doubtful folly with a smile, Or madly blaze unknown defects, is vile: 'Tis doubly vile, when but to prove your art, You fix an arrow in a blameless heart. O lost to honour's voice, O doom'd to shame, Thou fiend accurs'd, thou murderer of fame! Fell ravisher, from innocence to tear That name, than liberty, than life more dear! Where shall thy baseness meet its just return, Or what repay thy guilt, but endless scorn! And know, immortal truth shall mock thy toil: Immortal truth shall bid the shaft recoil; With rage retorted, wing the deadly dart; And empty all its poison in thy heart. With caution, next, the dang'rous power apply; An eagle's talon asks an eagle's eye: Let Satire then her proper object know, And ere she strike, be sure she strikes a foe. Nor fondly deem the real fool confest, Because blind Ridicule conceives a jest: Before whose altar Virtue oft' hath bled, And oft' a destin'd victim shall be led: Lo, It were to be wished that lord Shaftsbury had expressed himself with greater precision on this subject: however, thus much may be affirmed with truth. 1st, By the general tenor of his essays on Enthusiasm, and the freedom of wit and humour, it appears that his principal design was to recommend the way of ridicule, (as he calls it) for the investigation of truth, and detection of falsehood, not only in moral but religious subjects. 2dly, It appears no less evident, that in the course of his reasonings on this question, he confounds two things which are in their nature and consequences entirely different. These are ridicule and good-humour: the latter acknowledged by all to be the best mediator in every debate; the former no less regarded by most, as an embroiler and incendiary. Tho' he sets out with a formal profession of proving the efficacy of wit, humour, and ridicule, in the investigation of truth, yet by shifting and mixing his terms, he generally slides insensibly into mere encomiums on good-breeding, chearfulness, urbanity, and free enquiry. This indeed keeps something like an argument on foot, and amuses the superficial reader; but to a more observant eye discovers a very comtemptible defect, either of sincerity or penetration. The question concerning ridicule may be thus not improperly stated, Whether doubtful propositions of any kind can be determined by the application of ridicule? Much might be said on this question; but a few words will make the matter clear to an unprejudiced mind. The disapprobation or contempt which certain objects raise in the mind of man, is a particular mode of passion. The objects of his passion are apparent falsehood, incongruity, or impropriety of some particular kinds. Thus, the object of fear is apparent danger : the object of anger is apparent injury. But who hath ever dreamt of exalting the passions of fear and anger into a standard or test of real danger and injury? The design must have been rejected as absurd, because it is the work of reason only, to correct and fix the passions on their proper objects. The case is parallel: apparent or seeming falsehoods, &amp;c. are the objects of contempt; but it is the work of reason only, to determine whether the supposed falsehood be real or fictitious. But it is said, “The sense of ridicule can never be mistaken.”—Why, no more can the sense of danger, or the sense of injury.—“What, do men never fear or resent without reason?”—Yes, very commonly: but they as often despise and laugh without reason. Thus before any thing can be determined in either case, reason, and reason only, must examine circumstances, separate ideas, decide upon, restrain, and correct the passion. Hence it follows, that the way of ridicule, of late so much celebrated, is in fact no more than a species of eloquence; and that too the lowest of all others : so Tully justly calls it, tenuissimus ingenii fructus. It applies to a passion, and therefore can go no farther in the investigation of truth, than any of those arts which tend to raise love, pity, terror, rage or hatred in the heart of man. Consequently, his lordship might have transplanted the whole system of rhetorick into his new scheme, with the same propriety as he hath intorduced the way of ridicule itself. A hopeful project this, for the propagation of truth! As this seems to be the real nature of ridicule, it hath been generally discouraged by philosophers and divines, together with every other mode of eloquence, when applied to controverted opinions. This discouragement, from what is said above, appears to have been rational and just : therefore the charge laid ageinst divines with regard to this affair by a zealous admirer of Lord Shaftsbury (see a note on the Pleasures of Imagination, Book III.) seems entirely groundless. The distinction which the same author hath attempted with respect to the influence of ridicule, between speculative and moral truths, seems no better founded. It is certain that opinions are no less liable to ridicule than actions. And it is no less certain, that the way of ridicule cannot determine the propriety or impropriety of the one, more than the truth or falsehood of the other; because the same passion of contempt is equally engaged in both cases, and therefore, as above, reason only can examine the circumstances of the action or opinion, and thus fix the passion on its proper objects. Upon the whole, this new design of discovering truth by the vague and unsteady light of ridicule, puts one in mind of the honest Irishman, who apply'd his candle to the sun-dial in order to see how the night went. Shaftsb'ry rears her high on Reason's throne, And loads the slave with honours not her own: Big-swoln with folly, as her smiles provoke, Prophaneness spawns, pert dunces nurse the joke! Come, let us join awhile this tittering crew, And own the ideot guide for once is true; Deride our weak forefathers' musty rule, Who therefore smil'd, because they saw a fool; Sublimer logick now adorns our isle, We therefore see a fool, because we smile. Truth in her gloomy cave why fondly seek? Lo, gay she sits in Laughter's dimpled cheek: Contemns each surly academic foe, And courts the spruce free-thinker and the beau. Dædalian arguments but few can trace, But all can read the language of grimace. Hence mighty Ridicule's all-conqu'ring hand Shall work Herculean wonders thro' the land: Bound in the magick of her cobweb chain, You, mighty Warburton, shall rage in vain, In the vain trackless maze of Truth You scan, And lend th'informing clue to erring man: No more shall Reason boast her pow'r divine, Her base eternal shook by Folly's mine! Truth's sacred fort th'exploded laugh shall win; And coxcombs vanquish Berkley by a grin. But you, more sage, reject th'inverted rule, That Truth is e'er explor'd by Ridicule: On truth, on falsehood let her colours fall, She throws a dazzling glare alike on all; As the gay prism but mocks the flatter'd eye, And gives to ev'ry object ev'ry dye. Beware the mad advent'rer: bold and blind She hoists her sail, and drives with ev'ry wind; Deaf as the storm to sinking Virtue's groan, Nor heeds a friend's destruction, or her own. Let clear-ey'd Reason at the helm preside, Bear to the wind, or stem the furious tide; Then mirth may urge, when reason can explore, This point the way, that waft us glad to shore. Tho' distant times may rise in Satire's page, Yet chief 'tis her's to draw the present age: With Wisdom's lustre, Folly's shade contrast, And judge the reigning manners by the past: Bid Britain's heroes (aweful shades!) arise, And ancient honour beam on modern vice: Point back to minds ingenuous, actions fair, Till the sons blush at what their fathers were: Ere yet 'twas beggary the great to trust; Ere yet 'twas quite a folly to be just; When low-born sharpers only dar'd a lye, Or falsify'd the card, or cogg'd the dye: Ere lewdness the stain'd garb of honour wore, Or chastity was carted for the whore; Vice flutter'd, in the plumes of freedom dress'd; Or publick spirit was the publick jest. Be ever in a just expression bold, Yet ne'er degrade fair Satire to a scold: Let no unworthy mien her form debase, But let her smile, and let her frown with grace: In mirth be temp'rate, temp'rate in her spleen; Nor while she preaches modesty, obscene. Deep let her wound, not rankle to a sore, Nor call his lordship ?, her grace a ?: The Muse's charms resistless then assail, When wrapt in irony's transparent veil: Her beauties half-conceal'd the more surprize, And keener lustre sparkles in her eyes. Then be your line with sharp encomiums grac'd: Stile Clodius honourable, Bufa chaste. Dart not on Folly an indignant eye: Who e'er discharg'd artillery on a fly? Deride not Vice: absurd the thought and vain, To bind the tyger in so weak a chain. Nay more: when flagrant crimes your laughter move, The knave exults: to smile is to approve. The Muse's labour then success shall crown, When Folly feels her smile, and Vice her frown. Know next what measures to each theme belong, And suit your thoughts and numbers to your song: On wing proportion'd to your quarry rise, And stoop to earth, or soar among the skies. Thus when a modish folly you rehearse, Free the expression, simple be the verse. In artless numbers paint th'ambitious peer That mounts the box, and shines a charioteer: In strains familiar sing the midnight toil Of camps and senates disciplin'd by Hoyle. Patriots and chiefs whose deep design invades And carries off the captive king of—spades! Let Satire here in milder vigour shine, And gayly graceful sport along the line; Bid courtly Fashion quit her thin pretence, And smile each affectation into sense. Not so when Virtue by her guards betray'd, Spurn'd from her throne, implores the Muse's aid; When crimes, which erst in kindred darkness lay, Rise frontless, and insult the eye of day; Indignant Hymen veils his hallow'd fires, And white-rob'd Chastity with tears retires; When rank Adultery on the genial bed Hot from Cocytus rears her baleful head: When private faith and publick trust are sold, And traitors barter liberty for gold; When fell Corruption dark and deep, like Fate, Saps the foundation of a sinking state: When giant-vice and irreligion rise, On mountain'd falsehoods to invade the skies: Then warmer numbers glow thro' Satire's page, And all her smiles are darken'd into rage: On eagle-wing she gains Parnassus' height, Not lofty Epic soars a nobler flight: Then keener indignation fires her eye; Then flash her lightnings, and her thunders fly; Wide and more wide her flaming bolts are hurl'd, Till all her wrath involves the guilty world. Yet Satire oft' assumes a gentler mien, And beams on Virtue's friends a look serene: She wounds reluctant, pours her balm and joy, Glad to commend where merit strikes her eye. But tread with cautious step this dangerous ground, Beset with faithless precipices round: Truth be your guide: disdain Ambition's call; And if you fall with truth, you greatly fall. 'Tis Virtue's native lustre that must shine: The poet can but set it in his line: And who unmov'd with laughter can behold A sordid pebble meanly grac'd with gold? Let real merit then adorn your lays, For shame a tends on prostituted praise: And all your wit, your most distinguish'd art But makes us grieve, you want an honest heart. Nor think the Muse by Satire's law confin'd: She yields description of the noblest kind, Inferior art the landskip may design, And paint the purple evening in the line: Her daring thought essays a higher plan; Her hand delineates passion, pictures man. And great the toil, the latent soul to trace, To paint the heart, and catch internal grace; By turns bid vice or virtue strike our eyes, Now bid a Wolsey or a Cromwell rise; Now with a touch more sacred and refin'd, Call forth a Chesterfield's or Lonsdale's mind. Here sweet or strong may ev'ry colour flow, Here let the pencil warm, the canvass glow: Of light and shade provoke the noble strife, And wake each striking feature into life. PART III. Thro' ages thus hath Satire keenly shin'd, The friend to truth, to virtue, and mankind: Yet the bright flame from virtue ne'er had sprung, And man was guilty ere the poet sung. This Muse in silence joy'd each better age, Till glowing crimes had wak'd her into rage. Truth saw her honest spleen with new delight, And bade her wing her shafts, and urge their flight. First on the sons of Greece she prov'd her art, And Sparta felt the fierce Iambick dart Archilocum proprio rabies armavit Iambo. Hor.. To Latium next avenging Satire flew: The flaming faulchion rough Lucilius Ense velut stricto quoties Lucilius ardens Infremuit, rubet auditor cui frigida mens est Criminibus, tacita sudant præcordia culpa. Juv. S. 1. drew; With dauntless warmth in Virtue's cause engag'd, And conscious villains trembled as he rag'd. Then sportive Horace Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico Tangit, &amp; admissus circum præcordia ludit, Callidus excusso potulum suspendere Naso. Pers. S. 1. caught the generous fire For Satire's bow resign'd the sounding lyre: Each arrow polish'd in his hand was seen, And as it grew more polish'd, grew more keen. His art, conceal'd in study'd negligence Politely sly, cajol'd the foes of sense: He seem'd to sport and trifle with the dart, But while he sported, drove it to the heart. In graver strains majestick Persius wrote, Big with a ripe exuberance of thought: Greatly sedate, contemn'd a tyrant's reign, And lash'd corruption with a calm disdain. More ardent eloquence, and boundless rage Inflame bold Juvenal's exalted page. His mighty numbers aw'd corrupted Rome, And swept audacious greatness to its doom; The headlong torrent thundering from on high, Rent the proud rock that lately brav'd the sky. But lo! the fatal victor of mankind, Swoln Luxury!—Pale Ruin stalks behind! As countless insects from the north-east pour, To blast the spring, and ravage ev'ry flow'r: So barb'rous millions spread contagious death: The sick'ning laurel wither'd at their breath. Deep superstition's night the skies o'erhung, Beneath whose baleful dews the poppy sprung. No longer Genius woo'd the Nine to love, But Dulness nodded in the Muses' grove: Wit, spirit, freedom, were the sole offence, Nor aught was held so dangerous as sense. At length, again fair Science shot her ray, Dawn'd in the skies, and spoke returning day. Now Satire, triumph o'er thy flying foe, Now load thy quiver, string thy slacken'd bow! 'Tis done—See, great Erasmus breaks the spell, And wounds triumphant Folly in her cell! (In vain the solemn cowl surrounds her face, Vain all her bigot cant, her sowr grimace) With shame compell'd her leaden throne to quit, And own the force of reason urg'd by wit. 'Twas then plain Donne in honest vengeance rose, His wit refulgent, tho' his rhyme was prose: He 'midst an age of puns and pedants wrote With genuine sense, and Roman strength of thought. Yet scarce had Satire well relum'd her flame, (With grief the Muse records her country's shame) Ere Britain saw the foul revolt commence, And treach'rous Wit began her war with Sense. Then 'rose a shameless, mercenary train, Whom latest time shall view with just disdain: A race fantastick, in whose gaudy line Untutor'd thought, and tinsel beauty shine; Wit's shatter'd mirror lies in fragments bright, Reflects not nature, but confounds the sight. Dry morals the court-poet blush'd to sing: 'Twas all his praise to say “the oddest thing.” Proud for a jest obscene, a patron's nod, To martyr Virtue, or blaspheme his God. Ill-fated Dryden! who unmov'd can see Th'extremes of wit and meanness join'd in thee! Flames that cou'd mount, and gain their kindred skies, Low creeping in the putrid sink of vice: A Muse whom Wisdom woo'd, but woo'd in vain, The pimp of pow'r, the prostitute to gain: Wreaths, that shou'd deck fair Virtue's sorm alone, To strumpets, traitors, tyrants, vilely thrown: Unrival'd parts, the scorn of honest fame; And genius rise, a monument of shame! More happy France: immortal Boileau there Supported genius with a sage's care: Him with her love propitious Satire blest, And breath'd her airs divine into his breast: Fancy and sense to form his line conspire, And faultless judgment guides the purest fire. But see, at length, the British Genius smile, And show'r her bounties o'er her favour'd isle: Behold for Pope she twines the laurel crown, And centers ev'ry poet's pow'r in one: Each Roman's force adorns his various page; Gay smiles, collected strength, and manly rage. Despairing Guilt and Dulness loath the sight, As spectres vanish at approaching light: In this clear mirror with delight we view Each image justly fine, and boldly true: Here Vice, drag'd forth by Truth's supreme decree, Beholds and hates her own deformity: While self-seen Virtue in the faithful line With modest joy surveys her form divine. But oh, what thoughts, what numbers shall I find, But faintly to express the poet's mind! Who yonder star's effulgence can display, Unless he dip his pencil in the ray? Who paint a god, unless the god inspire? What catch the lightning, but the speed of fire? So, mighty Pope, to make thy genius known, All pow'r is weak, all numbers—but thy own. Each Muse for thee with kind contention strove, For thee the Graces left th'Idalian grove: With watchful fondness o'er thy cradle hung, Attun'd thy voice, and form'd thy infant tongue. Next, to her bard majestick Wisdom came; The bard enraptur'd caught the heav'nly flame: With taste superior scorn'd the venal tribe, Whom fear can sway, or guilty greatness bribe; At fancy's call who rear the wanton sail, Sport with the stream, and trifle in the gale: Sublimer views thy daring spirit bound; Thy mighty voyage was creation's round; Intent new worlds of wisdom to explore, And bless mankind with Virtue's sacred store; A nobler joy than wit can give, impart; And pour a moral transport o'er the heart. Fantastick wit shoots momentary fires, And like a meteor, while we gaze, expires: Wit kindled by the sulph'rous breath of Vice, Like the blue lightning, while it shines, destroys: But genius, fir'd by truth's eternal ray, Burns clear and constant, like the source of day: Like this, its beam prolifick and refin'd Feeds, warms, inspirits, and exalts the mind; Mildly dispels each wint'ry passion's gloom, And opens all the virtues into bloom. This praise, immortal Pope, to thee be giv'n: Thy genius was indeed a gift from heav'n. Hail, bard unequall'd, in whose deathless line Reason and wit with strength collected shine: Where matchless wit but wins the second praise, Lost, nobly lost, in truth's superior blaze. Did Friendship e'er mislead thy wand'ring Muse? That friendship sure may plead the great excuse: That sacred friendship which inspir'd thy song, Fair in defect, and amiably wrong. Error like this ev'n truth can scarce reprove; 'Tis almost virtue when it flows from love. Ye deathless names, ye sons of endless praise, By Virtue crown'd with never-fading bays! Say, shall an artless Muse, if you inspire, Light her pale lamp at your immortal fire? Or if, O Warburton, inspir'd by You, The daring Muse a nobler path pursue, By You inspir'd, on trembling pinion soar, The sacred founts of social bliss explore, In her bold numbers chain the tyrant's rage, And bid her country's glory fire her page: If such her fate, do thou, fair Truth, descend, And watchful guard her in an honest end: Kindly severe, instruct her equal line To court no friend, nor own a foe but thine. But if her giddy eye should vainly quit Thy sacred paths, to run the maze of wit; If her apostate heart shou'd e'er incline To offer incense at Corruption's shrine; Urge, urge thy pow'r, the black attempt confound, And dash the smoaking censer to the ground. Thus aw'd to fear, instructed bards may see, That guilt is doom'd to sink in infamy. A Character of Mr. POPE's Writings. BEING An Episode from the Poem call'd Sickness, Book II. By the Rev. Mr. THOMPSON. —In measur'd time (So heav'n has will'd) together with their snows, The everlasting hills shall melt away: This solid globe dissolve, as ductile wax Before the breath of Vulcan; like a scroll Shrivel th'unfolded curtains of the sky; Thy planets, Newton, tumble from their spheres; The moon be perish'd from her bloody orb; The sun himself, in liquid ruin, rush And deluge with destroying flames the globe— Peace then, my soul, nor grieve that Pope is dead. If e'er the tuneful spirit, sweetly strong, Spontaneous numbers, teeming in my breast, Enkindle; O, at that exalting name, Be favourable, be propitious now, While, in the gratitude of praise, I sing The works and wonders of this man divine. I tremble while I write—His lisping Muse Surmounts the loftiest efforts of my age. What wonder? when an infant, he apply'd The loud Translation of the First Book of Statius's Thebais. Papinian trumpet to his lips, Fir'd by a sacred fury, and inspir'd With all the god, in sounding numbers sung “Fraternal rage, and guilty Thebes' alarms.” Sure at his birth (things not unknown of old) The Graces round his cradle wove the dance, And led the maze of harmony: the Nine Prophetick of his future honours, pour'd Plenteous, upon his lips, Castalian dews; And Attick bees their golden store distill'd. The soul of Homer, sliding from its star, Where, radiant, over the poetick world It rules and sheds its influence, for joy Shouted, and bless'd the birth: the sacred choir Of poets, born in elder, better times, Enraptur'd catch'd the elevating sound, And roll'd the gladd'ning news from sphere to sphere. Windsor Forest: Mr. Pope born there.Imperial Wsndsor! raise thy brow august, Superbly gay exalt thy tow'ry head; And bid thy forests dance, and nodding, wave A verdant testimony of thy joy: A native Orpheus warbling in thy shades. O listen to Pastorals. Alexis' tender plaint! How gently rural! without coarseness plain; How simple in his elegance of grief! A shepherd, but no clown. His every lay Sweet as the early pipe along the dale, When hawthorns bud, or on the thymy brow When all the mountains bleat, and vallies sing. Soft as the nightingale's harmonious woe, In dewy even-tide, when cowslips drop Their sleepy heads, and languish in the breeze. Essay on Criticism.Next in the critick-chair survey him thron'd, Imperial in his art, prescribing laws Clear from the knitted brow, and squinted sneer; Learn'd without pedantry; correctly bold, And regularly easy. Gentle, now, As rising incense, or descending dews, The variegated echo of his theme: Now, animated flame commands the soul To glow with sacred wonder. Pointed wit And keen discernment form the certain page. Just, as the Stagyrite; as Horace, free; As Fabian, clear; and as Petronius, gay. Rape of the Lock.But whence those peals of laughter shake the sides Of decent mirth? Am I in Fairy-land? Young, evanescent forms, before my eyes, Or skim, or seen to skim; thin essences Of fluid light; zilphs, zilphids, elves, and gnomes; Genii of Rosicruce, and ladies' gods!— And, lo, in shining trails Belinda's hair, Bespangling with dishevell'd beams the skies, Flames o'er the night. Behind, a satyr grins, And, jocund, holds a glass, reflecting, fair, Hoops, crosses, mattadores; beaux, shocks, and belles, Promiscuously whimsical and gay. Tassoni, hiding his diminish'd head, Droops o'er the laughing page: while Boileau skulks, With blushes cover'd, low beneath the desk. More Ovid's Sappho to Phaon: And Eloise to Abelard. mournful scenes invite. The milky vein Of amorous grief devolves its placid wave Soft-streaming o'er the soul, in weeping woe And tenderness of anguish. While we read Th'infectious page, we sicken into love, And languish with involuntary fires. The Zephyr, panting on the silken buds Of breathing violets; the virgin's sigh, Rosy with youth, are turbulent and rude, To Sappho's plaint, and Eloïsa's moan. Heav'ns! what a flood of empyréal day My aking eyes involves! A Temple of Fame. temple soars, Rising like exhalations on a mount, And wide its adamantine valves expands. Three monumental columns, bright in air, Of figur'd gold, the center of the quire With lustre fill. Pope on the midmost shines Betwixt his Homer and his Horace plac'd, Superior, by the hand of Justice. Fame, With all her mouths, th'eternal trumpet swells, Exulting at his name; and, grateful, pours The lofty notes of never-dying praise, Triumphant, floating on the wings of wind, Sweet o'er the world: th'ambrosial spirit flies Diffusive, in its progress wid'ning still, “Dear to the earth, and grateful to the sky.” Fame owes him more than e'er she can repay: She owes her very temple to his hands; Like Ilium built; by hands no less divine! Attention, rouze thyself! the master's hand, (The master of our souls!) has chang'd the key, And bids the thunder of the battle roar Tumultuous Translation of Homer.. Homer, Homer is our own! And Grecian heroes flame in British lines. What pomp of words! what nameless energy Kindles the verse; invigours every line; Astonishes, and overwhelms the soul In transports toss'd! when fierce Achilles raves, And flashes, like a comet, o'er the field, To wither armies with his martial frown. I see the battle rage; I hear the wheels Careering with their brazen orbs! The shout Of nations roll (the labour of the winds) Full on my ear, and shakes my inmost soul. Description never cou'd so well deceive: 'Tis real! Troy is here, or I at Troy Enjoy the war. My spirits, all on fire, With unextinguish'd violence are borne Above the world, and mingle with the gods. Olympus rings with arms! the firmament, Beneath the lightning of Minerva's shield, Burns to the center: rock the tow'rs of heav'n, All nature trembles, save the throne of Jove. Ethick Epistles.To root excesses from the human breast; Behold a beauteous pile of Ethicks rise; Sense, the foundation; harmony, the walls; (The Dorique grave, and gay Corinthian join'd) Where Socrates and Horace jointly reign. Best of philosophers! of poets too The best! he teaches thee thy self to know: That virtue is the noblest gift of heav'n: “And vindicates the ways of God to man.” O hearken to the moralist polite! Enter his school of truth: where Plato's self Might preach; and Tully deign to lend an ear. Dunciad.Last see him waging with the fools of rhyme A wanton, harmless war. Dunce after dunce; Beaux, doctors, templars, courtiers; sophs and cits, Condemn'd to suffer life. The motley crew, Emerging from oblivion's muddy pool, Give the round face to view; and shameless front Proudly expose; till laughter have her fill. Born to improve the age, and cheat mankind Into the road of honour!—Vice again The gilded chariot drives:—For he is dead! I saw the sable barge, along his Thames, In slow solemnity beating the tide, Convey his sacred dust!—Its swains expir'd; Wither'd, in Twit'nam bow'rs, the laurel-bough; Silent, the Muses broke their idle lyres: Th'attendant Graces check'd the sprightly dance, Their arms unlock'd, and catch'd the starting tear: And Virtue for her lost defender mourn'd! The Cave of Pope. A Prophecy. By R? D?. When dark oblivion in her sable cloak Shall wrap the names of heroes and of kings; And their high deeds submitting to the stroke Of time shall fall amongst forgotten things: Then (for the Muse that distant day can see) On Thames's bank the stranger shall arrive, With curious wish thy sacred grott to see, Thy sacred grott shall with thy name survive. Grateful posterity, from age to age, With pious hand the ruin shall repair: Some good old man, to each enquiring sage Pointing the place, shall cry, “The Bard liv'd there, “Whose song was musick to the listening ear, “Yet taught audacious vice and folly, shame: “Easy his manners, but his life severe; “His word alone gave infamy or fame. “Sequester'd from the the fool and coxcomb-wit, “Beneath this silent roof the Muse he found; “'Twas here he slept inspir'd, or sate and writ; “Here with his friends the social glass went round.” With aweful veneration shall they trace The steps which thou so long before hast trod; With reverend wonder view the solemn place, From whence thy genius soar'd to nature's God. Then, some small gem, or moss, or shining ore, Departing, each shall pilfer, in fond hope To please their friends on ev'ry distant shore, Boasting a relick from the cave of Pope.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. IV. An ELEGY WRITTEN IN A Country Church Yard. By Mr. Gray. The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea, The plowman homewards plods his weary way, And leaves the world to darkness and to me. Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight, And all the air a solemn stillness holds, Save where the beetle wheels his drony flight, And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds; Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r The mopeing owl does to the moon complain Of such, as wand'ring near her secret bow'r, Molest her ancient, solitary reign. Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade, Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap, Each in his narrow cell for ever laid, The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep. The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn, The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed, The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn, No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed. For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn, Or busy houswife ply her evening care: No children run to lisp their fire's return, Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share. Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield, Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke; How jocund did they drive their team afield! How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke! Let not Ambition mock their useful toil, Their homely joys, and destiny obscure; Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile, The short and simple annals of the poor. The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r, And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave, Await alike th'inevitable hour. The paths of glory lead but to the grave. Nor you, ye Proud, impute to These the fault, If Mem'ry o'er their Tomb no Trophies raise, Where thro' the long-drawn isle and fretted vault The pealing anthem swells the note of praise. Can storied urn or animated bust Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath? Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust, Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold ear of Death? Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire; Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd, Or wak'd to extasy the living lyre. But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page Rich with the spoils of Time did ne'er unroll; Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage, And froze the genial current of the soul. Full many a gem of purest ray serene, The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear; Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the desart air. Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast, The little Tyrant of his fields withstood; Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest, Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood. Th'applause of list'ning senates to command, The threats of pain and ruin to despise, To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land, And read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes Their lot forbad: nor circumscrib'd alone Their growing virtues, but their crimes confin'd; Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne, And shut the gates of mercy on mankind. The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide, To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame, Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride With incense kindled at the Muse's flame. Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife, Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray; Along the cool sequester'd vale of life They kept the noiseless tenor of their way. Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect Some frail memorial still erected nigh, With uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck'd, Implores the passing tribute of a sigh. Their name, their years, spelt by th'unletter'd Muse, The place of fame and elegy supply: And many a holy text around she strews, That teach the rustic moralist to dye. For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey, This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd, Left the warm precincts of the chearful day, Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind? On some fond breast the parting soul relies, Some pious drops the closing eye requires; Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries, Ev'n in our Ashes live their wonted Fires. For thee, who mindful of th'unhonour'd Dead Dost in these lines their artless tale relate; If chance, by lonely Contemplation led, Some kindred Spirit shall inquire thy fate, Haply some hoary-headed Swain may say, ‘Oft have we see him at the peep of dawn ‘Brushing with hasty steps the dews away ‘To meet the sun upon the upland lawn. ‘There at the foot of yonder nodding beech ‘That wreathes its old fantastick roots so high, ‘His listless length at noon-tide wou'd he stretch, ‘And pore upon the brook that babbles by. ‘Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn, ‘Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he wou'd rove; ‘Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn, ‘Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love. ‘One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill, ‘Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree: ‘Another came; nor yet beside the rill, ‘Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he; ‘The next with dirges due in sad array, ‘Slow through the church-way path we saw him born, ‘Approach and read (for thou can'st read) the lay, ‘Grav'd on the stone beneath you aged thorn. The EPITAPH. Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth, A Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown, Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth, And Melancholy mark'd him for her own. Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere, Heav'n did a recompence as largely send: He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear, He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend. No farther seek his merits to disclose, Or draw his frailties from their dread abode, (There they alike in trembling hope repose) The bosom of his Father and his God. HYMN to ADVERSITY. By the Same, Daughter of Jove, relentless Pow'r, Thou Tamer of the human breast, Whose iron scourge and tort'ring hour The Bad affright, afflict the Best! Bound in thy adamantine chain The Proud are taught to taste of pain, And purple tyrants vainly groan With pangs unfelt before, unpitied and alone. When first thy Sire to send on earth Virtue, his darling Child, design'd, To thee he gave the heav'nly Birth, And bad to form her infant mind. Stern rugged Nurse! thy rigid lore With patience many a year she bore: What sorrow was, thou bad'st her know, And from her own she learn'd to melt at others' woe. Scared at thy frown terrific, fly Self-pleasing Folly's idle brood, Wild Laughter, Noise, and thoughtless Joy, And leave us leisure to be good. Light they disperse, and with them go The summer Friend, the flatt'ring Foe; By vain Prosperity received, To her they vow their truth, and are again believed. Wisdom in sable garb array'd, Immers'd in rapt'rous thought profound, And Melancholy, silent maid With leaden eye, that loves the ground, Still on thy solemn steps attend: Warm Charity, the gen'ral friend, With Justice to herself severe, And Pity, dropping soft the sadly-pleasing tear. Oh! gently on thy Suppliant's head, Dread Goddess, lay thy chast'ning hand! Not in thy Gorgon terrors clad, Nor circled with the vengeful Band (As by the Impious thou art seen) With thund'ring voice, and threat'ning mien, With screaming Horror's funeral cry, Despair, and fell Disease, and ghastly Poverty. Thy form benign, oh Goddess, wear, Thy milder influence impart, Thy philosophic Train be there To soften, not to wound my heart, The gen'rous spark extinct revive, Teach me to love, and to forgive, Exact my own defects to scan, What others are to feel, and know myself a man. EDUCATION. A POEM: IN TWO CANTOS. Written in Imitation of the Style and Manner of SPENSER's Fairy Queen. Inscribed to Lady Langham, Widow of Sir John Langham, Bart. By GILBERT WEST, Esq; Unum studium vere liberale est, quod liberum facit. Hoc sapientiæ studium est, sublime, forte, magnanimum: cætera pusilla &amp; puerilia sunt.—Plus scire velle quàm sit satis intemperantiæ genus est. Quid, quòd ista liberalium artium consectatio molestos, verbosos, intempestivos, sibi placentes facit, &amp; ideo non dicentes necessaria, quia super-vacua didicerunt. Sen. Ep. 88. O goodly Discipline! from heav'n y-sprong! Parent of Science, queen of Arts refin'd! To whom the Graces, and the Nine belong: O! bid those Graces, in fair chorus join'd With each bright Virtue that adorns the mind! O bid the Muses, thine harmonious train, Who by thy aid erst humaniz'd mankind, Inspire, direct, and moralize the strain, That doth essay to teach thy treasures how to gain! And Thou, whose pious and maternal care, The substitute of heavenly Providence, With tenderest love my orphan life did rear, And train me up to manly strength and sense; With mildest awe, and virtuous influence, Directing my unpractis'd wayward feet To the smooth walks of Truth and Innocence; Where Happiness heart-felt, Contentment sweet, Philosophy divine aye hold their blest retreat. Thou, most belov'd, most honour'd, most rever'd! Accept this verse, to thy large merit due! And blame me not, if by each tye endear'd, Of nature, gratitude, and friendship true, The whiles this moral thesis I pursue, And trace the plan of goodly Nurture, Education. Nurture o'er, I bring thy modest virtues into view; And proudly boast that from thy precious store, Which erst enrich'd my heart, I drew this sacred lore, And thus, I ween, thus shall I best repay The valued gifts, thy careful love bestow'd; If imitating Thee, well as I may, I labour to diffuse th'important good, 'Till this great truth by all be understood; “That all the pious duties which we owe, “Our parents, friends, our country and our God; “The seeds of every virtue here below, “From Discipline alone, and early Culture grow. CANTO I. ARGUMENT. The Knight, as to Phædîa is a Greek word, signifying Education. Pædîa's house He his young Son conveys, Is staid by Custom; with him fights, And his vain pride dismays. [I] A gentle Knight there was, whose noble deeds O'er Fairy Land by Fame were blazon'd round: For warlike enterprize, and sage Areeds, counsels. areeds Emong the chief alike was he renown'd; Whence with the marks of highest honours crown'd By Gloriana, in domestick peace, That port, to which the wise are ever bound, He anchor'd was, and chang'd the tossing seas Of bustling busy life, for calm sequester'd ease. II There in domestick virtue rich and great As erst in publick, 'mid his wide domain, Long in primæval patriarchal state, The lord, the judge, the father of the plain, He dwelt; and with him, in the golden chain Of wedded faith y-link'd, a matron sage Aye dwelt; sweet partner of his joy and pain, Sweet charmer of his youth, friend of his age, Skill'd to improve his bliss, his sorrows to assuage. III From this fair union, not of sordid gain, But merit similar and mutual love, True source of lineal virtue, sprung a train Of youths and virgins; like the beauteous grove, Which round the temple of Olympick Jove, Begirt with youthful bloom the This tree grew in the Altis, or sacred grove of Olympick Jupiter at Olympia, having, as the Eleans pretended, been originally planted there by Hercules. It was esteemed sacred, and from that were taken the Olympick crowns. See Pausanias. Eliac. and the Dissertation on the Olympick Games. parent tree, The sacred olive; whence old Elis wove Her verdant crowns of peaceful victory, The Guerdons, rewards. guerdons of bold strength, and swift activity. IV So round their noble parents goodly rose These generous scyons: they with watchful care Still, as the swelling passions 'gan disclose The buds of future virtues, did prepare With prudent culture the young shoots to rear: And aye in this endearing pious toil They by a Palmer, pilgrim. The person here signified is Mr. Locke. characteriz'd by his works. Palmer sage instructed were, Who from deep thought and studious search erewhile Had learnt to mend the heart, and till the human soil. V For by cœlestial Wisdom whilom led Through all th'apartments of th'immortal mind, He view'd the secret stores, and mark'd the Sted, place, station, sted To judgment, wit, and memory assign'd; And how sensation and reflection join'd To fill with images her darksome grotte, Where variously disjointed or combin'd, As reason, fancy, or opinion wrought, Their various masks they play'd, and fed her pensive thought. VI Alse, also, further.Alse through the fields of Science had he stray'd With eager search, and sent his piercing eye Through each learn'd school, each philosophick shade, Where Truth and Virtue erst were deem'd to lie; If haply the fair vagrants he Mote, might. mote spy, Or hear the musick of their charming lore: But all unable there to satisfy His curious soul, he turn'd him to explore The sacred writ of Faith; to learn, believe, adore. VII Thence foe profess'd of Falshood and Deceit, Those sly artificers of tyranny, Aye, ever.Aye holding up before uncertain feet His faithful light, to Knowledge, Liberty, Mankind he led, to Civil policy, And mild Religion's charitable law; That fram'd by Mercy and Benignity The persecuting sword forbids to draw, And free-created souls with penal terrours awe. VIII Ne, nor.Ne with these glorious gifts elate and vain Lock'd he his wisdom up in churlish pride; But, stooping from his height, would even deign The feeble steps of Infancy to guide. Eternal glory Him therefore betide! Let every generous youth his praise proclaim! Who, wand'ring through the world's rude forest wide, By him hath been y-taught his course to frame To Virtue's sweet abodes, and heav'n-aspiring Fame! IX For this the Fairy Knight with anxious thought, And fond paternal care his counsel pray'd; And him of gentlest courtesy besought His guidance to vouchsafe and friendly aid; The while his tender offspring he convey'd, Through devious paths to that secure retreat; Where sage Pædîa, with each tuneful maid, On a wide mount had fix'd her rural seat, 'Mid flow'ry gardens plac'd, untrod by vulgar feet. X And now forth-pacing with his blooming heir, And that same virtuous Palmer them to guide; Arm'd all to point, and on a courser fair Y-mounted high, in military pride, His little train before he slow did ride. Him eke behind a gentle squire Ensues, follows, ensues, With his young lord aye marching side by side, His counsellour and guard, in goodly Thews, manners. thews, Who well had been brought up, and nurs'd by every Muse. XI Thus as their pleasing journey they pursued, With chearful argument beguiling pain; Ere long descending from an hill they view'd Beneath their eyes out-stretch'd a spacious plain, That fruitful shew'd, and apt for every grain, For pastures, vines and flow'rs; while Nature fair Sweet-smiling all around with count'nance Fain, earnest, eager. fain Seem'd to demand the tiller's art and care, Her wildness to correct, her lavish waste repair. XII Right good, I ween, and bounteous was the soil, Aye wont in happy season to repay With tenfold usury the peasant's toil. But now 'twas ruin all, and wild decay; Untill'd the garden and the fallow lay, The sheep-shorne down with barren Brakes, briars. brakes o'ergrown The whiles the merry peasants sport and play, All as the publick evil were unknown, Or every publick care from every breast was flown. XIII Astonish'd at a scene at once so fair And so deform'd; with wonder and delight At man's neglect, and Nature's bounty rare, In studious thought a-while the Fairy Knight, Bent on that goodly Lond, land. lond his eager sight: Then forward rush'd, impatient to descry What towns and castles there-in were Empight, placed. empight; For towns him seem'd, and castles he did spy, As to th'horizon round he stretch'd his roaming eye. XIV Nor long way had they travell'd, ere they came To a wide stream, that with tumultuous roar Emongst rude rocks its winding course did frame. Black was the wave and sordid, cover'd o'er With angry foam, and stain'd with infants' gore. Thereto along th'unlovely margin stood A birchen grove that waving from the shore, Aye cast upon the tide its falling bud, And with its bitter juice empoison'd all the flood. XV Right in the centre of the vale empight, Not distant far a forked mountain rose; In outward form presenting to the sight That fam'd Parnassian hill, on whose fair brows The Nine Aonian Sisters wont repose; List'ning to sweet Castalia's sounding stream, Which through the plains of Cirrha murm'ring flows; But This to That compar'd mote justly seem Ne fitting haunt for gods, ne worthy man's esteem. XVI For this nor founded deep, nor spredden wide, Nor high up-rais'd above the level plain, By toiling art through tedious years applied, From various parts compil'd with studious pain, Was Erst, formerly. erst up-thrown; if so it mote attain, Like that poetick mountain, to be Hight, called, named. hight The noble seat of Learning's goodly train. Thereto, the more to captivate the sight, It like a garden fair most curiously was Dight, drest. dight. XVII In figur'd plots with leafy walls inclos'd, By measure and by rule it was out-lay'd; With symmetry so regular dispos'd, That plot to plot still answer'd, shade to shade; Each correspondent twain alike array'd With like embellishments of plants and flow'rs, Of statues, vases, spouting founts, that play'd Through shells of Tritons their ascending show'rs, And labyrinths involv'd and trelice-woven bow'rs. XVIII There likewise mote be seen on every side The yew obedient to the planter's will, And shapely box of all their branching pride Ungently shorne, and with preposterous skill To various beasts and birds of sundry quill Transform'd, and human shapes of monstrous size; Huge as that giant-race, who, hill on hill High-heaping, sought with impious vain Emprize, enterprize, attempt. emprize, Despite of thund'ring Jove, to scale the steepy skies. XIX Alse other wonders of the sportive shears Fair Nature mis-adorning there were found; Globes, spiral columns, pyramids and piers With sprouting urns and budding statues crown'd; And horizontal dials on the ground In living box by cunning artists trac'd; And gallies trim, on no long voyage bound, But by their roots there ever anchor'd fast, All, used frequently by the old English poets for all-though.All were their bellying sails out-spread to every blast. XX O'er all appear'd the mountain's forked brows With terrasses on terrasses up-thrown; And all along arrang'd in order'd rows, And visto's broad, the velvet slopes adown The ever-verdant trees of Daphne shone. But aliens to the clime, and brought of old From Latian plains, and Grecian Helicon, They shrunk and languish'd in a foreign mold, By changeful summers starv'd, and pinch'd by winter's cold. XXI Amid this verdant grove with solemn state, On golden thrones of antique form reclin'd, In mimick majesty Nine Virgins sate, In features various, as unlike in mind: Alse boasted they themselves of heav'nly kind, And to the sweet Parnassian Nymphs allied; Thence round their brows the Delphick bay they twin'd, And matching with high names their apish pride, O'er every learned school aye claim'd they to preside. XXII In antique garbs, for modern they disdain'd, By Greek and Roman artists Whilom, formerly. whilom made, Of various woofs, and variously distain'd With tints of ev'ry hue, were they array'd; And here and there ambitiously display'd A purple shred of some rich robe, prepared Erst by the Muses or th'Aonian Maid, To deck great Tullius or the Mantuan Bard; Which o'er each motley vest with uncouth splendor glared. XXIII And well their outward vesture did express The bent and habit of their inward mind, Affecting Wisdom's antiquated dress, And usages by Time cast far behind. Thence, to the charms of younger Science blind, The customs, laws, the learning, arts and phrase Of their own countries they with scorn declin'd; Ne sacred Truth herself would they embrace, Unwarranted, unknown in their fore-fathers' days. XXIV Thus ever backward casting their survey; To Rome's old ruins and the groves forlorn Of elder Athens, which in prospect lay Stretch'd out beneath the mountain, would they turn Their busy search, and o'er the rubbish mourn. Then gathering up with superstitious care, Each little scrap, however foul or torn, In grave harangues they boldly would declare, This Ennius, Varro; This the Stagyrite did wear. XXV Yet, under names of venerable sound, While o'er the world they stretch'd their aweful rod; Through all the provinces of Learning own'd For teachers of whate'er is wise and good. Alse from each region to their Drad, dreadful. drad abode Came youth unnumber'd, crowding all to taste The streams of Science; which united flow'd Adown the mount, from nine rich sources cast; And to the vale below in one rude torrent pass'd. XXVI O'er every source, protectress of the stream, One of those Virgin Sisters did preside; Who, dignifying with her noble name Her proper flood, are pour'd into the tide The heady vapours of scholastick pride Despotical and abject, bold and blind, Fierce in debate, and forward to decide; Vain love of praise, with adulation join'd, And disingenuous scorn, and impotence of mind. XXVII Extending from the hill on every side, In circuit vast a verdant valley spread; Across whose uniform flat bosom glide Ten thousand streams, in winding mazes led, By various sluices from one common head; A turbid mass of waters, vast, profound, Hight of Philology the lake; and fed By that rude torrent, which with roaring sound Came tumbling from the hill, and flow'd the level round. XXVIII And every where this spacious valley o'er, Fast by each stream was seen a numerous throng Of beardless striplings to the birch-crown'd shore, By nurses, guardians, fathers dragg'd along: Who helpless, meek, and innocent of wrong, Were torn reluctant from the tender side Of their fond mothers, and by Faitour, doer, from faire to do, and fait deed, commonly used by Spenser in a bad sense. faitours strong, By pow'r made insolent, and hard by pride, Were driv'n with furious rage, and lash'd into the tide. XXIX On the rude bank with trembling feet they stood, And casting round their oft-reverted eyes, If haply they mote 'scape the hated flood, Fill'd all the plain with lamentable cries; But far away th'unheeding father flies, Constrain'd his strong compunctions to repress; While close behind, assuming the disguise Of nurturing care, and smiling tenderness, With secret scourges arm'd those griesly faitours press. XXX As on the steepy margin of a brook, When the young sun with flowery Maia rides, With innocent dismay a bleating flock Crowd back, affrighted at the rolling tides: The shepherd-swain at first exhorting chides Their Seely, simple. seely fear; at length impatient grown, With his rude crook he wounds their tender sides; And all regardless of their piteous moan, Into the dashing wave compels them furious down. XXXI Thus urg'd by mast'ring Fear and dol'rous Teen, pain, grief. Teen Into the current plung'd that infant crowd. Right piteous was the spectacle, I ween, Of tender striplings stain'd with tears and blood, Perforce conflicting with the bitter flood; And labouring to attain the distant shore, Where holding forth the gown of manhood stood The siren Liberty, and ever-more Sollicited their hearts with her inchanting lore. XXXII Irksome and long the passage was, perplex'd With rugged rocks on which the raving tide By sudden bursts of angry tempests vex'd Oft dash'd the youth, whose strength mote ill abide With head up-lifted o'er the waves to ride. Whence many wearied ere they had o'er-past The middle stream (for they in vain have tried) Again return'd Astounded, astonish'd. astounded and aghast; Ne one regardful look would ever backward cast. XXXIII Some, of a rugged, more enduring frame, Their toilsome course with patient pain pursu'd; And tho' with many a bruise and Muchel, much. muchel blame, Eft hanging on the rocks, and eft embru'd Deep in the muddy stream, with hearts subdu'd And quail'd by labour, gain'd the shore at last, But in life's practick Lear, learning lear unskill'd and rude, Forth to that forked hill they silent pac'd; Where hid in studious shades their fruitless hours they waste. XXXIV Others of rich and noble lineage bred, Though with the crowd to pass the flood constrain'd, Yet o'er the crags with fond indulgence led By hireling guides and in all depths sustain'd, Skimm'd lightly o'er the tide, undipt, unstain'd, Save with the sprinkling of the wat'ry spray: And aye their proud prerogative maintain'd, Of ignorance and ease and wanton play, Soft harbingers of vice, and præmature decay. XXXV A few, alas, how few! by heav'n's high will With subtile spirits endow'd and sinews strong, Albe, although.Albe sore Mated, amaz'd, scared. mated by the tempests shrill, That bellow'd fierce and rife the rocks among, By their own native vigour borne along Cut briskly through the waves; and forces new Gathering from toil, and ardor from the throng Of rival youths, outstript the labouring crew, And to the true Parnasse, Parnassus. Parnasse, and heav'n-thron'd glory flew. XXXVI Dire was the tumult, and from every shore Discordant echoes struck the deafen'd ear, Heart-thrilling cries, with sobs and Singults, sighs. singults sore Short-interrupted, the imploring tear, And furious stripes, and angry threats severe, Confus'dly mingled with the jarring sound Of all the various speeches that While-ere, formerly. while-ere On Shinar's wide-spread champain did astound High Babel's builders vain, and their proud works confound. XXXVII Much was the Knight empassion'd at the scene, But more his blooming son, whose tender breast Empierced deep with sympathizing teen On his pale cheek the signs of dread impress'd, And fill'd his eyes with tears, which sore distress'd Up to his sire he rais'd in mournful wise; Who with sweet smiles paternal soon redress'd His troublous thoughts, and clear'd each sad surmise; Then turns his ready steed, and on his journey hies. XXXVIII But far he had not march'd ere he was stay'd By a rude voice, that like th'united sound Of shouting myriads, through the valley bray'd, And shook the groves, the floods, and solid ground: The distant hills rebellow'd all around. “Arrest, Sir Knight, it cried, thy fond career, “Nor with presumptuous disobedience wound “That aweful majesty which all revere! “In my commands, Sir Knight, the voice of nations hear! XXXIX Quick turn'd the Knight, and saw upon the plain Advancing tow'rds him with impetuous gate, And visage all inflamed with fierce disdain, A monstrous Giant, on whose brow elate Shone the bright ensign of imperial state; Albeit lawful kingdom he had none; But laws and kingdoms wont he oft create, And oft' times over both erect his throne, While senates, priests and kings his Sov'ran, for sovereign. sov'ran sceptre own. XL Custom he hight; and aye in every land Usurp'd dominion with despotick sway O'er all he holds; and to his high command Constrains even stubborn Nature to obey; Whom dispossessing oft, he doth assay To govern in her right: and with a pace So soft and gentle doth he win his way, That she unwares is caught in his embrace, And tho' deflowr'd and thrall'd nought feels her foul disgrace. XLI For nurt'ring, even from their tend'rest age, The docile sons of men withouten pain, By disciplines and rules to every stage Of life accommodate, he doth them train Insensibly to wear and hug his chain. Alse his behests or gentle or severe, Or good or noxious, rational or vain, He craftily persuades them to revere, As institutions sage, and venerable lear. XLII Protector therefore of that forked hill, And mighty patron of those Sisters Nine, Who there enthron'd, with many a copious rill Feed the full streams, that through the valley shine, He deemed was; and aye with rites divine, The Lacedemonians in order to make their children hardy and endure pain with constancy and courage, were accustomed to cause them to be scourged very severely. And I myself (says Plutarch, in his life of Lycurgus) have seen several of them endure whipping to death, at the foot of the altar of Diana surnamed Orthia.Like those, which Sparta's hardy race of yore Were wont perform at fell Diana's shrine, He doth constrain his vassals to adore Perforce their sacred names, and learn their sacred lore. XLIII And to the Fairy Knight now drawing near, With voice terrifick and imperious mien, (All was he wont less dreadful to appear, When known and practised than at distance seen) And kingly stretching forth his sceptre sheen, Him he commandeth, upon threat'ned pain Of his displeasure high and vengeance keen, From his rebellious purpose to refrain, And all due honours pay to Learning's rev'rend train. XLIV So saying and forestalling all reply, His peremptory hand without delay, As one who little car'd to justify His princely will, long us'd to boundless sway, Upon the Fairy Youth with great dismay In every quaking limb convuls'd, he lay'd: And proudly stalking o'er the verdant Lay, mead, trouble, misfortune, &amp;c. lay, Him to those scientifick streams convey'd, With many his young compeers therein to be Embay'd, bathed, dipt. embay'd. XLV The Knight his tender son's distressful Stour, stour Perceiving, swift to his assistance flew: Ne vainly stay'd to deprecate that pow'r, Which from submission aye more haughty grew. For that proud Giant's force he wisely knew, Not to be meanly dreaded, nor defy'd With rash presumption; and with courage true, Rather than step from Virtue's paths aside, Oft had he singly scorn'd his all-dismaying pride. XLVI And now, disdaining parle, his courser hot He fiercely prick'd, and couch'd his vengeful spear; Where-with the Giant he so rudely smot, That him perforce constrain'd to Wend arrear, move backwards. wend arrear. Who, much abash'd at such rebuke severe, Yet his accustom'd pride recov'ring soon, Forth-with his massy sceptre 'gan up-rear; For other warlike weapon he had none, Ne other him behoved to quell his boldest Fone, foes. fone. XLVII With that enormous mace the Fairy Knight So sore he Bet, beat; bray'd, resounded, bet, that all his armour Bet, beat; bray'd, resounded, bray'd, To pieces well-nigh riven with the might Of so tempestuous strokes; but He was stay'd, And ever with deliberate valour weigh'd The sudden changes of the doubtful fray; From cautious prudence oft deriving aid, When force unequal did him hard assay: So lightly from his steed he leapt upon the lay. XLVIII Then swiftly drawing forth his Trenchant, cutting. trenchant blade, High o'er his head he held his fenceful shield; And warily fore-casting to evade The Giant's furious arm, about him wheel'd, With restless steps aye traversing the field. And ever as his foe's intemperate pride, Through rage defenceless, mote advantage yield, With his sharp sword so oft he did him Gride, cut, hack. gride, That his gold-sandal'd feet in crimson floods were dyed. XLIX His baser parts he maim'd with many a wound; But far above his utmost reach were Pight, placed. pight The forts of life: ne never to confound With utter ruin, and abolish quite A power so puissant by his single might Did he presume to hope: Himself alone From lawless force to free, in bloody fight He stood; content to bow to Custom's throne, So Reason mote not blush his sov'ran rule to own. L So well he warded, and so fiercely press'd His foe, that weary wex'd he of the fray; Yet Nould he algates, would not by any means. nould he algates lower his haughty crest; But masking in contempt his sore dismay, Disdainfully releas'd the trembling prey, As one unworthy of his princely care; Then proudly casting on the warlike Fay, fairy. fay A smile of scorn and pity, through the air 'Gan blow his shrilling horn; the blast was heard afar. LI Eftsoons astonish'd at th'alarming sound, The signal of distress and hostile wrong, Confusedly trooping from all quarters round, Came pouring o'er the plain a numerous throng Of every sex and order, old and young; The vassals of great Custom's wide domain, Who to his lore inur'd by usage long, His every summons heard with pleasure fain, And felt his every wound with sympathetick pain. LII They, when their bleeding king they did behold, And saw an armed Knight him standing near, Attended by that Palmer sage and bold; Whose vent'rous search of devious Truth while-ere Spread through the realms of Learning horrors drear, Y-seized were at first with terrors great; And in their boding hearts began to fear, Dissention factious, controversial hate, And innovations strange in Custom's peaceful state. LIII But when they saw the Knight his fauchion sheathe And climbing to his steed march thence away, With all his hostile train, they 'gan to breathe With freer spirit, and with aspect gay Soon chaced the gathering clouds of black affray. Alse their great monarch, cheared with the view Of myriads, who confess his sov'ran sway, His ruffled pride began to plume anew; And on his bugle clear a strain of triumph blew. LIV There-at the multitude, that stood around, Sent up at once a universal roar Of boisterous joy: the sudden-bursting sound, Like the explosion of a warlike store Of nitrous grain, th'afflicted Welkin, sky. welkin tore. Then turning towards the Knight, with scoffings lewd, Heart-piercing insults, and revilings sore, Loud bursts of laughter vain, and hisses rude, As through the throng he pass'd, his parting steps pursued. LV Alse from that forked hill the boasted seat Of studious Peace and mild Philosophy, Indignant murmurs mote be heard to threat, Mustering their rage; eke baleful Infamy, Rouz'd from her den of base obscurity By those same Maidens Nine, began to sound Her brazen trump of black'ning obloquy: While Satire, with dark clouds encompast round, Sharp, secret arrows shot, and aim'd his back to wound. LVI But the brave Fairy Knight no whit dismay'd Held on his peaceful journey o'er the plain; With curious eye observing, as he stray'd Through the wide provinces of Custom's reign, What mote afresh admonish him remain Fast by his virtuous purpose; all around So many objects mov'd his just disdain; Him seem'd that nothing serious, nothing sound In city, village, bow'r, or castle mote be found. LVII In village, city, castle, bow'r and hall, Each sex, each age, each order and degree, To vice and idle sport abandon'd all, Kept one perpetual general jubilee. Ne suffer'd ought disturb their merry glee; Ne sense of private loss, ne publick woes, Restraint of law, Religion's drad decree, Intestine desolation, foreign foes, Nor heav'n's tempestuous threats, nor earth's convulsive throws. LVIII But chiefly they whom Heav'n's disposing hand Had seated high on Fortune's upper stage; And plac'd within their call the sacred band That waits on Nature and Instruction sage, If happy their wise Hests, behests, precepts, commands. hests mote them engage To climb through knowledge to more noble praise; And as they mount, enlighten every age With the bright influence of fair Virtue's rays; Which from the aweful heights of Grandeur brighter blaze. LIX They, O perverse and base ingratitude! Despising the great ends of Providence, For which above their mates they were endued With health, authority, and eminence, To the low services of brutal sense Abused the means of pleasures more refin'd, Of knowledge, virtue, and beneficence; And fettering on her throne th'immortal mind, The guidance of her realm to passions wild resign'd. LX Hence thoughtless, shameless, reckless, spiritless, Nought worthy of their kind did they assay; But or benumb'd with palsied Idleness In meerly living loiter'd life away. Or by false taste of pleasure led astray, For-ever wand'ring in the sensual bow'rs Of feverish Debauch, and lustful Play, Spent on ignoble toils their active pow'rs, And with untimely blasts diseas'd their vernal hours. LXI Ev'n they to whom kind Nature did accord A frame more delicate, and purer mind, Through the foul brothel and the wine-stain'd board Of beastly Comus loathing they declin'd, Yet their soft hearts to idle joys resign'd; Like painted insects, through the summer-air With random flight aye ranging unconfin'd; And tasting every flower and blossom fair, Withouten any choice, withouten any care. LXII For choice them needed none, who only sought With vain amusements to beguile the day; And wherefore should they take or care or thought, Whom Nature prompts, and Fortune calls to play? “Lords of the earth, be happy as ye may!” So learn'd, so taught the leaders of mankind; Th'unreasoning vulgar willingly obey, And leaving toil and poverty behind, Ran forth by different ways the blissful boon to find. LXIII Nor tedious was the search; for every where, As nigh great Custom's royal tow'rs the Knight Pass'd through th'adjoining hamlets, mote he hear The merry voice of festival Delight Saluting the return of morning bright With matin-revels, by the mid-day hours Scarce ended; and again with dewy night, In cover'd theatres, or leafy bow'rs Offering her evening-vows to Pleasure's joyous pow'rs. LXIV And ever on the way mote he espy Men, women, children, a promiscuous throng Of rich, poor, wise and simple, low and high, By land, by water, passing aye along With mummers, anticks, musick, dance and song, To Pleasure's numerous temples, that beside The glistening streams, or tufted groves among, To every idle foot stood open wide, And every gay desire with various joys supplied. LXV For there each heart with diverse charms to move, The sly inchantress summoned all her train: Alluring Venus, queen of fragrant love, The boon companion Bacchus loud and vain, And tricking Hermes, god of fraudful gain, Who, when blind Fortune throws, directs the die, And Phœbus tuning his soft Lydian strain To wanton motions, and the lover's sigh, And thought-beguiling shew, and masking revelry. LXVI Unmeet associates there for noble youth, Who to true honour meaneth to aspire; And for the works of virtue, faith, and truth Would keep his manly faculties entire. The which avizing well, the cautious sire From that soft siren land of Pleasaunce vain, With timely haste was minded to retire, Or ere, before.Or ere the sweet contagion mote attain His son's unpractic'd heart, yet free from vicious stain. LXVII So turning from that beaten road aside, Through many a devious path at length he paced, As that experienc'd Palmer did him guide, 'Till to a mountain hoare they come at last; Whose high-rais'd brows with silvan honours graced, Majestically frown'd upon the plain, And over all an aweful horrour cast. Seem'd as those villas gay it did disdain, Which spangled all the vale like Flora's painted train. LXVIII The hill ascended strait, ere-while they came To a tall grove, whose thick-embow'ring shade, Impervious to the sun's meridian flame Ev'n at mid-noon a dubious twilight made; Like to that sober light, which disarray'd Of all its gorgeous robe, with blunted beams, Through windows dim with holy acts pourtray'd, Along some cloister'd abby faintly gleams, Abstracting the rapt thought from vain earth-musing themes. LXIX Beneath this high o'er-arching canopy Of clust'ring oaks, a silvan colonnade, Aye list'ning to the native melody Of birds sweet-echoing through the lonely shade, On to the centre of the grove they stray'd; Which, in a spacious circle opening round, Within it's shelt'ring arms securely laid, Disclos'd to sudden view a vale profound, With Nature's artless smiles and tranquil beauties crown'd. LXX There, on the basis of an ancient pile, Whose cross surmounted spire o'erlook'd the wood, A venerable Matron they ere-while Discover'd have, beside a murm'ring flood Reclining in right sad and pensive mood. Retir'd within her own abstracted breast She seem'd o'er various woes by turns to brood; The which her changing chear by turns exprest, Now glowing with disdain, with grief now Over-kest, for over-cast. over-kest. LXXI Her thus immers'd in anxious thought profound When-as the Knight perceiv'd, he nearer drew; To weet what bitter bale did her astound, And whence th'occasion of her anguish grew. For that right noble Matron well he knew; And many perils huge, and labours sore Had for her sake endured; her vassal true, Train'd in her love, and practiced evermore Her honour to respect, and reverence her lore. LXXII O dearest drad! he cried, fair island queen! Mother of heroes! empress of the main! What means that stormy brow of troublous teen? Sith, since.Sith heav'n-born Peace, with all her smiling train Of sciences and arts, adorns thy reign With wealth and knowledge, splendour and renown? Each port how throng'd! how fruitful every plain! How blithe the country! and how gay the town! While Liberty secures and heightens every boon! LXXIII Awaken'd from her trance of pensive woe By these fair flattering words, she rais'd her head; And bending on the Knight her frowning brow, Mock'st thou my sorrows, Fairy Son? she said. Or is thy judgment by thy heart misled To deem that certain, which thy hopes suggest? To deem them full of lise and Lustihead, strong health, vigour. lustihead, Whose cheeks in Hebe's vivid tints are drest, And with Joy's careless mien, and dimpled smiles imprest? LXXIV Thy unsuspecting heart how nobly good I know, how sanguine in thy country's cause! And mark'd thy virtue, singly how it stood Th'assaults of mighty Custom, which o'er-awes The faint and timorous mind, and oft withdraws From Reason's lore th'ambitious and the vain By the sweet lure of popular applause, Against their better knowledge, to maintain The lawless throne of Vice, or Folly's childish reign. LXXV How vast his influence! how wide his sway! Thy self ere-while by proof didst understand: And saw'st, as through his realms thou took'st thy way, How Vice and Folly had o'er-spread the land. And can'st thou then, O Fairy's Son, demand The reason of my woe? or hope to ease The throbbings of my heart with speeches bland, And words more apt my sorrows to increase, The once-dear names of Wealth, and Liberty, and Peace? LXXVI Peace, Wealth, and Liberty, that noblest boon, Are blessings only to the wise and good. To weak and vicious minds their worth unknown, And thence abused but serve to furnish food For riot and debauch, and fire the blood With high-spiced luxury; whence strife, debate, Ambition, envy, Faction's vip'rous brood, Contempt of order, manners profligate; The symptoms of a foul, diseased and bloated state. LXXVII Ev'n Wit and Genius, with their learned train Of Arts and Muses, though from heav'n above Descended, when their talents they prophane To varnish folly, kindle wanton love, And aid excentrick sceptic Pride to rove Beyond cœlestial Truth's attractive sphere, This moral system's central sun, aye prove To their fond votaries a curse severe, And only make mankind more obstinately err. LXXVIII And stand my sons herein from censure clear? Have They consider'd well, and understood The use and import of those blessings dear, Which the great Lord of Nature hath bestow'd As well to prove, as to reward the good? Whence are these torrents then, these billowy seas Of vice, in which, as in his proper flood, The fell leviathan licentious plays, And upon ship-wreck'd faith, and sinking virtue preys? LXXIX To you, ye Noble, Opulent and Great! With friendly voice I call, and honest zeal! Upon your vital influences wait The health and sickness of the common-weal; The maladies you cause, yourselves must heal. In vain to the unthinking harden'd crowd Will Truth and Reason make their just appeal; In vain will sacred Wisdom cry aloud; And Justice drench in vain her vengeful sword in blood. LXXX With You must reformation first take place: You are the head, the intellectual mind Of this vast body politick; whose base, And vulgar limbs, to drudgery consign'd, All the rich stores of Science have resign'd To You, that by the craftsman's various toil, The sea-worn mariner, and sweating hind, In peace and affluence maintain'd, the while You, for yourselves and them, may dress the mental soil. LXXXI Bethink you then, my children, of the trust In you repos'd: ne let your heav'n-born mind Consume in pleasure, or unactive rust; But nobly rouse you to the task assign'd, The godlike task to teach and mend mankind: Learn that ye may instruct: to virtue lead Yourselves the way: the herd will crowd behind, And gather precepts from each worthy deed: “Example is a lesson, that all men can read. LXXXII But if (to All or Most I do not speak) In vain and sensual habits now grown old, The strong Circæan charm you cannot break, Nor re-assume at will your native Mould, shape, form. mould, Yet envy not the state, you could not hold; And take compassion on the rising age: In them redeem your errours manifold; And by due discipline and nurture sage, In Virtue's lore betimes your docile sons engage. LXXXIII You chiefly, who like me in secret mourn The prevalence of Custom lewd and vain; And you, who, though by the rude torrent borne Unwillingly along you yield with pain To his behests, and act what you disdain, Yet nourish in your hearts the gen'rous love Of piety and truth, no more restrain The manly zeal; but all your sinews move The present to reclaim, the future race improve! LXXXIV Eftsoons by your joint efforts shall be quell'd Yon haughty Giant, who so proudly sways A sceptre by repute alone upheld; Who where he cannot dictate strait obeys. Accustom'd to conform his flattering phrase To numbers and high-plac'd authority, Your party he will join, your maxims praise, And drawing after all his menial fry, Soon teach the general voice your act to ratify. LXXXV Ne for th'atchievement of this great emprize The want of means or counsel may ye dread. From my Twin-Daughters' fruitful wombs shall rise A race of letter'd sages, deeply read In Learning's various writ: by whom y-led Through each well cultur'd plot, each beauteous grove, Where antique Wisdom whilom wont to tread, With mingled glee and profit may ye rove, And cull each virtuous plant, each tree of knowledge prove. LXXXVI Yourselves with virtue thus and knowledge fraught Of what, in ancient days of good or great Historians, bards, philosophers have taught; Join'd with whatever else of modern date Maturer judgment, search more accurate Discover'd have of Nature, Man, and God, May by new laws reform the time-worn state Of cell-bred discipline, and smoothe the road That leads through Learning's vale to Wisdom's bright abode. LXXXVII By you invited to her secret bow'rs Then shall Pædîa reascend her throne With vivid laurels girt and fragrant flow'rs; While from their forked mount descending down Yon supercilious pedant train shall own Her empire paramount, ere long by Her Y-taught a lesson in their schools unknown, “To Learning's richest treasures to prefer “The knowledge of the world, and man's great business there. LXXXVIII On this prime science, as the final end Of all her discipline, and nurturing care, Her eye Pædîa fixing aye shall bend Her every thought and effort to prepare Her tender pupils for the various war, Which Vice and Folly shall upon them wage, As on the perilous march of life they fare With prudent lore fore-arming every age Gain'st Pleasure's treacherous joys, and Pain's embattled rage. LXXXIX Then shall my youthful sons, to Wisdom led By fair example and ingenuous praise, With willing feet the paths of Duty tread; Through the world's intricate or rugged ways Conducted by Religion's sacred rays; Whose soul-invigorating influence Shall purge their minds from all impure allays Of sordid selfishness and brutal sense, And swell th'ennobled heart with blest benevolence. XC Then also shall this emblematick pile, By magick whilom fram'd to sympathize With all the fortunes of this changeful isle, Still, as my sons in fame and virtue rise, Grow with their growth, and to th'applauding skies It's radiant cross up-lift; the while, to grace The multiplying niches, fresh supplies Of worthies shall succeed, with equal pace Aye following their sires in virtue's glorious race. XCI Fir'd with th'idea of her future fame She rose majestick from her lowly sted; While from her vivid eyes a sparkling flame Out-beaming, with unwonted light o'erspread That monumental pile; and as her head To every front she turn'd, discover'd round The venerable forms of heroes dead; Who for their various merit erst renown'd, In this bright fane of glory shrines of honour found. XCII On these that royal dame her ravish'd eyes Would often feast; and ever as she spy'd Forth from the ground the length'ning structure rise With new-plac'd statues deck'd on every side, Her parent-breast would swell with gen'rous pride. And now with her in that sequester'd plain, The Knight awhile constraining to abide, She to the Fairy Youth with pleasure fain Those sculptur'd chiefs did shew, and their great lives explain I cannot forbear taking occasion from these words to make my acknowledgements to the writers of Biographia Britannica, for the pleasure and profit I have lately received from perusing the two first volumes of that useful and entertaining work, of which the monumental structure above-mentioned, decorated with the statues of great and good men, is no improper emblem. This work, which contains the lives of the most eminent persons, who have flourished in Great Britain and Ireland, from the earliest ages, down to the present time, appears to me, as far as it has hitherto gone, to be executed with great spirit, accuracy, and judgment; and deserves, in my opinion, to be encouraged by all, who have at heart the honour of their country, and that of their particular families and friends; and who can any ways assist the ingenious and laborious authors, to render as perfect as possible, a design so apparently calculated to serve the publick, by setting in the truest and fullest light the characters of persons already generally, though perhaps too indistinctly known; and retrieving from obscurity and oblivion, examples of private and retired merit, which, though less glaring and ostentatious than the former, are not, however, of a less extensive or less beneficial influence. To those, who may happen not to have seen this repository of British glory, I cannot give a better idea of it, than in the following lines of Virgil: Hic manus ob patriam pugnando vulnera passi; Quique sacerdotes casti, dum vita manebat; Quique pii vates &amp; Phœbo digna locuti; Inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per artes; Quique sui memores alios fecere merendo. Virg. Æn. L. 6.. The End of the First CANTO. PENSHURST. INSCRIBED TO WILLIAM PERRY, Esq; AND The Honourable Mrs. Elizabeth Perry. By the late Mr. F. Coventry. Genius of Penshurst old! Who saw'st the birth of each immortal oak, Here sacred from the stroke; And all thy tenants of yon turrets bold, Inspir'st to arts or arms; Where Sir Philip Sidney. Sidney his Arcadian landscape drew, Genuine from thy Doric view; And patriot Algernon Sidney. Algernon unshaken rose Above insulting foes; And Saccharissa nurs'd her angel charms. O suffer me with sober tread To enter on thy holy shade; Bid smoothly-gliding Medway stand, And wave his sedgy tresses bland, A stranger let him kindly greet, And pour his urn beneath my feet. And see where Perry opes his door To land me on the social floor; Nor does the heiress of these shades deny To bend her bright majestic eye, Where Beauty shines, and Friendship warm, And Honour in a female form. With them in aged groves to walk, And lose my thoughts in artless talk, I shun the voice of Party loud, I shun loose Pleasure's idle crowd, And monkish academic cell, Where Science only feigns to dwell, And court, where speckled Vanity Apes her tricks in tawdry die, And shifts each hour her tinsel hue, Still furbelow'd in follies new. Here Nature no distortion wears, Old Truth retains his silver hairs, And Chastity her matron step, And purple Health her rosy lip. Ah! on the virgin's gentle brow How Innocence delights to glow! Unlike the town-dame's haughty air, The scornful eye and harlot's stare; But bending mild the bashful front As modest Fear is ever wont: Shepherdesses such of old, Doric bards enamour'd told, While the pleas'd Arcadian vale Echo'd the enchanting tale. But chief of Virtue's lovely train, A pensive exile on the plain, No longer active now to wield Th'avenging sword, protecting shield, Here thoughtful-walking Liberty Remembers Britons once were free. With her would Nobles old converse, And learn her dictates to rehearse, Ere yet they grew refin'd to hate The hospitable rural seat, The spacious hall with tenants stor'd, Where Mirth and Plenty crown'd the board; Ere yet their Lares they forsook, And lost the genuine British look, The conscious brow of inward merit, The rough, unbending, martial spirit, To clink the chain of Thraldom gay, And court-idolatry to pay; To live in city smoaks obscure, Where morn ne'er wakes her breezes pure, Where darkest midnight reigns at noon, And fogs eternal blot the sun. But come, the minutes flit away, And eager Fancy longs to stray: Come, friendly Genius! lead me round Thy sylvan haunts and magic ground; Point every spot of hill or dale, And tell me, as we tread the vale, “Here mighty Dudly once wou'd rove, “To plan his triumphs in the grove: “There looser Waller, ever gay, “With Sacchariss in dalliance lay; “And Philip, side-long yonder spring, “His lavish carols wont to sing.” Hark! I hear the echoes call, Hark! the rushing waters fall; Lead me to the green retreats, Guide me to the Muses' seats, Where ancient bards retirement chose, Or ancient lovers wept their woes. What Genius points to yonder An oak in Penshurst park, planted the day Sir Philip Sidney was born, of which Ben Johnson speaks in the following manner: That taller tree, which of a nut was set, At his great birth, where all the Muses met. oak? What rapture does my soul provoke? There let me hang a garland high, There let my Muse her accents try; Be there my earliest homage paid, Be there my latest vigils made: For thou wast planted in the earth The day that shone on Sidney's birth. That happy time, that glorious day The Muses came in concert gay; With harps in tune, and ready song, The jolly Chorus tript along; In honour of th'auspicious morn, To hail an infant genius born: Next came the Faun, in order meet, The Satyrs next with cloven feet, The Dryads swift that roam the woods, The Naiads green that swim the floods; Sylvanus left his silent cave, Medway came dropping from the wave; Vertumnus led his blushing spouse, And Ceres shook her wheaten brows, And Mars with milder look was there, And laughing Venus grac'd the rear. They join'd their hands in festive dance, And bade the smiling babe advance; Each gave a gift; Sylvanus last Ordain'd, when all the pomp was past, Memorial meet, a tree to grow, Which might to future ages shew, That on select occasion rare, A troop of Gods assembled there: The Naiads water'd well the ground, And Flora twin'd a wood-bine round: The tree sprung fast in hallow'd earth, Co-æval with th'illustrious birth Thus let my feet unwearied stray; Nor satisfied with one survey, When morn surveys with doubtful light, And Phebe pales her lamp of night, Still let me wander forth anew, And print my footsteps on the dew, What time the swain with ruddy cheek Prepares to yoke his oxen meek, And early drest in neat array The milk-maid chanting shrill her lay, Comes abroad with milking pail; And the sound of distant flail Gives the ear a rough good-morrow, And the lark from out his furrow Soars upright on matin wings, And at the gate of heaven sings. But when the sun with fervid ray Drives upwards to his noon of day, And couching oxen lay them down Beneath the beechen umbrage brown; Then let me wander in the hall, Round whose antique-visag'd wall Hangs the armour Britons wore, Rudely cast in days of yore. Yon sword some heroe's arm might wield, Red in the ranks of Chalgrave's field, Where ever-glorious Hampden bled, And Freedom tears of sorrow shed. Or in the gallery let me walk, Where living pictures seem to talk, Where Beauty smiles serenely fair, And Courage frowns with martial air; Tho' whiskers quaint the face disguise, And habits odd to modern eyes. Behold what kings in Britain reign'd, Plantagenets with blood distain'd, And valiant Tudor's haughty race, And Stuarts, England's worst disgrace. The Norman first, with cruel frown, Proud of his new-usurped crown, Begins the list; and many more, Stern heroes form'd of roughest ore. See victor Henry there advance, Ev'n in his look he conquers France; And murd'rer Richard, justly slain By Richmond's steel on Bosworth plain; See the tyrant of his wives, Prodigal of fairest lives, And laureat Edward nurs'd in arts, Minerva school'd his kingly parts: But ah! the melancholy Jane, A soul too tender for a queen! She sinks beneath imperial sway, The dear-bought scepter of a day! And must she mount the scaffold drear? Hard-hearted Mary, learn to spare! Eliza next salutes the eye; Exalt the song to Liberty, The Muse repeats the sacred name, Eliza fills the voice of fame. From thence a baser age began, The royal ore polluted ran, Till foreign Nassau's valiant hand Chac'd holy tyrants from the land: Downward from hence descend apace To Brunswick's high, illustrious race; And see the canvas speaks them brave, An injur'd nation born to save, Active in Freedom's righteous cause, And conscious of a just applause. But chiefly pleas'd, the curious eye, With nice discernment loves to try The labour'd wonders, passing thought, Which warm Italian pencils wrought; Fables of love, and stories old, By Greek or Latian poets told; How Jove committed many a rape, How young Acteon lost his shape; Or what celestial pen-men writ, Or what the painter's genuine wit From Fancy's store-house could devise; Where Raphael claims the highest prize. Madonas here decline the head, With fond maternal pleasure fed, Or lift their lucid eyes above, Where more is seen than holy love. There temples stand display'd within, And pillars in long order seen, And roofs rush forward to the sight, And lamps affect a living light. Or landscapes tire the trav'ling eye, The clouds in azure volumes fly, The distant trees distinguish'd rise, And hills look little in the skies. When day declines, and ev'ning cool Begins her gentle, silent rule, Again, as Fancy points the way, Benignant leader, let me stray: And wilt thou, Genius, bring along (So shall my Muse exalt her song) The Lord who rules this ample scene, His Consort too with gracious mien, Her little offspring prattling round, While Echo lisps their infant sound. And let Good-nature, born to please, Wait on our steps, and graceful Ease; Nor Mirth be wanting as we walk, Nor Wit to season sober talk; Let gay Description too attend, And Fable told with moral end, And Satire quick that comes by stealth, And flowing Laughter, friend to Health. Meanwhile Attention loves to mark The deer that crop the shaven park, The steep-brow'd hill, or forest wild, The sloping lawns, and zephyrs mild, The clouds that blush with ev'ning red, Or meads with silver fountains fed, The fragrance of the new-mown hay, And black-bird chanting on the spray; The calm farewel of parting light, And Ev'ning sad'ning into Night. Nor wearied yet my roving feet, Tho' Night comes on amain, retreat; But still abroad I walk unseen Along the star-enlighten'd green; Superior joys my soul invite, Lift, lift to heav'n the dazzled sight. Lo, where the moon enthron'd on high, Sits steady empress of the sky, Enticing nations to revere, And proudly vain of pagan fear; Or where thro' clouds she travels fast, And seems on journey bent in haste, While thousand hand-maid stars await, Attendant on their queen of state. 'Tis now that in her high controul, Ambitious of a foreign rule, She stirs the Ocean to rebel, And factious waters fond to swell Guides to battle in her carr, 'Gainst her sister Earth to war. Thus let me muse on things sublime, Above the flight of modern rhyme, And call the soul of Newton down, Where it sits high on starry throne, Inventing laws for worlds to come, Or teaching comets how to roam: With him I'd learn of every star, But sour-ey'd Pedantry be far, And Ignorance in garb of Sense, With terms of art to make pretence. Hail happy soil! illustrious earth! Which gav'st so many heroes birth; Which never wand'ring poet trod, But felt within th'inspiring God! In these transporting, solemn shades, First I salute th'Aonian maids. Ah lead me, Genius, to thy haunts, Where Philomel at ev'ning chants, And as my oaten pipe resounds, Give musick to the forming sounds. A simple shepherd, yet unknown, Aspires to snatch an ivy crown, On daring pinions bold to soar, Tho' here thy Waller sung before, And Johnson dipt his learned pen, And Sidney pour'd his fancy-flowing strain. TO THE Hon. Wilmot Vaughan, Esq; in Wales. By the Same. Ye distant realms that hold my friend Beneath a cold ungenial sky, Where lab'ring groves with weight of vapours bend, Or raving winds o'er barren mountains fly; Restore him quick to London's social clime, Restore him quick to friendship, love and joy; Be swift, ye lazy steeds of Time, Ye moments, all your speed employ. Behold November's glooms arise, Pale suns with fainter glory shine, Dark gathering tempests blacken in the skies, And shiv'ring woods their sickly leaves resign. Is this a time on Cambrian hills to roam, To court disease in Winter's baleful reign, To listen to th'Atlantic foam, While rocks repel the roaring main, While horror fills the region vast, Rheumatic tortures Eurus brings, Pregnant with agues flies the northern blast, And clouds drop quartans from their flagging wings: Dost thou explore Sabrina's fountful source, Where huge Plinlimmon's hoary height ascends: Then downward mark her vagrant course, Till mix'd with clouds the landscape ends? Dost thou revere the hallow'd soil Where Druids old sepulchred lie; Or up cold Snowden's craggy summits toil, And muse on ancient savage liberty? Ill suit such walks with bleak autumnal air, Say, can November yield the joys of May? When Jove deforms the blasted year, Can Wallia boast a chearful day? The town expects thee.—Hark, around, Thro' every street of gay resort, New chariots rattle with awak'ning sound, And crowd the levees, and besiege the court. The patriot, kindling as his wars ensue, Now fires his soul with liberty and fame, Marshals his threat'ning tropes anew, And gives his hoarded thunders aim. Now seats their absent lords deplore, Neglected villas empty stand, Capacious Gro'venor gathers all its store, And mighty London swallows up the land. See sportive Vanity her flights begin, See new-blown Folly's plenteous harvest rise, She mimick beauties dye their skin, And harlots roll their venal eyes. Fashions are set, and fops return, And young coquettes in arms appear; Dreaming of conquest, how their bosoms burn, Trick'd in the new fantastry of the year. Fly then away, nor scorn to bear a part In this gay scene of folly amply spread: Follies well us'd refine the heart, And pleasures clear the studious head; By grateful interchange of mirth The toils of study sweeter grow, As varying seasons recommend the earth, Nor does Apollo always bend his bow. AN EPISTLE ADDRESS'D TO Sir THOMAS HANMER, On his Edition of Shakespear's Works. By Mr. WILLIAM COLLINS. SIR, While born to bring the Muse's happier days, A patriot's hand protects a poet's lays: While nurs'd by you she sees her myrtles bloom, Green and unwither'd o'er his honour'd tomb: Excuse her doubts, if yet she fears to tell What secret transports in her bosom swell: With conscious awe she hears the critic's fame, And blushing hides her wreath at Shakespear's name. Hard was the lot those injur'd strains endur'd, Unown'd by Science, and by years obscur'd, Fair Fancy wept; and echoing sighs confess'd A fixt despair in ev'ry tuneful breast. Not with more grief th'afflicted swains appear, When wintry winds deform the plenteous year; When ling'ring frosts the ruin'd seats invade Where Peace resorted, and the Graces play'd. Each rising art by just gradation moves, Toil builds on toil, and age on age improves: The Muse alone unequal dealt her rage, And grac'd with noblest pomp her earliest stage. Preserv'd thro' time, the speaking scenes impart Each changeful wish of Phædra's tortur'd heart: Or paint the curse, that mark'd the The Œdipus of Sophocles. Theban's reign, A bed incestuous, and a father slain. With kind concern our pitying eyes o'erflow, Trace the sad tale, and own another's woe. To Rome remov'd, with wit secure to please, The Comic sisters kept their native ease. With jealous fear declining Greece beheld Her own Meander's art almost excell'd! But ev'ry Muse essay'd to raise in vain Some labour'd rival of her Tragic strain; Ilyssus' laurels, tho' transferr'd with toil, Droop'd their fair leaves, nor knew th'unfriendly soil. As arts expir'd, resistless Dulness rose; Goths, priests, or Vandals,—all were Learning's foes. Till Julius II. the immediate predecessor of Leo X. Julius first recall'd each exil'd maid, And Cosmo own'd them in th'Etrurian shade: Then deeply skill'd in love's engaging theme, The soft Provencial pass'd to Arno's stream: With graceful ease the wanton lyre he strung, Sweet flow'd the lays—but love was all he sung. The gay description could not fail to move; For, led by nature, all are friends to love. But heav'n, still various in its works, decreed The perfect boast of time should last succeed. The beauteous union must appear at length, Of Tuscan fancy, and Athenian strength: One greater Muse Eliza's reign adorn, And ev'n a Shakespear to her fame be born! Yet ah! so bright her morning's opening ray, In vain our Britain hop'd an equal day! No second growth the western isle could bear, At once exhausted with too rich a year. Too nicely Johnson knew the critic's part; Nature in him was almost lost in art. Of softer mold the gentle Fletcher came, The next in order, as the next in name. With pleas'd attention 'midst his scenes we find Each glowing thought, that warms the female mind; Each melting sigh, and ev'ry tender tear, The lover's wishes and the virgin's fear. His Their characters are thus distinguished by Dryden. ev'ry strain the Smiles and Graces own; But stronger Shakespear felt for Man alone: Drawn by his pen, our ruder passions stand Th'unrival'd picture of his early hand. About the time of Shakespear, the poet Hardy was in great repute in France. He wrote, according to Fontenelle, six hundred plays. The French poets after him applied themselves in general to the correct improvement of the stage, which was almost totally disregarded by those of our own country, Johnson excepted.With gradual steps, and slow, exacter France Saw Art's fair empire o'er her shores advance: By length of toil a bright perfection knew, Correctly bold, and just in all she drew. Till late Corneille, with The favourite author of the elder Corneille. Lucan's spirit fir'd, Breath'd the free strain, as Rome and He inspir'd: And classic judgment gain'd to sweet Racine The temp'rate strength of Maro's chaster line. But wilder far the British laurel spread, And wreaths less artful crown our poet's head. Yet He alone to ev'ry scene could give Th'historian's truth, and bid the manners live. Wak'd at his call I view, with glad surprize, Majestic forms of mighty monarchs rise. There Henry's trumpets spread their loud alarms, And laurel'd Conquest waits her hero's arms. Here gentler Edward claims a pitying sigh, Scarce born to honours, and so soon to die! Yet shall thy throne, unhappy infant, bring No beam of comfort to the guilty king: The Tempus erit Turno, magno cum optaverit emptum Intactum pallanta, &amp;c. time shall come, when Glo'ster's heart shall bleed In life's last hours, with horror of the deed: When dreary visions shall at last present Thy vengeful image in the midnight tent, Thy hand unseen the secret death shall bear, Blunt the weak sword, and break th'oppressive spear. Where-e'er we turn, by Fancy charm'd, we find Some sweet illusion of the cheated mind. Oft, wild of wing, she calls the soul to rove With humbler nature, in the rural grove; Where swains contented own the quiet scene, And twilight fairies tread the circled green: Dress'd by her hand, the Woods and Vallies smile, And Spring diffusive decks th'inchanted isle. O more than all in pow'rful genius blest, Come, take thine empire o'er the willing breast! Whate'er the wounds this youthful heart shall feel, Thy songs support me, and thy morals heal! There ev'ry thought the poet's warmth may raise, There native musick dwells in all the lays. O might some verse with happiest skill persuade Expressive Picture to adopt thine aid! What wond'rous draughts might rise from ev'ry page! What other Raphaels charm a distant age! Methinks ev'n now I view some free design, Where breathing Nature lives in ev'ry line: Chaste and subdu'd the modest lights decay, Steal into shades, and mildly melt away. —And see, where See the tragedy of Julius Cæsar. Anthony in tears approv'd, Guard the pale relicks of the chief he lov'd: Over the cold corse the warrior seems to bend, Deep sunk in grief, and mourns his murder'd friend! Still as they press, he calls on all around, Lifts the torn robe, and points the bleeding wound. But Coriolanus. See Mr. Spence's dialogue on the Odyssey. who is he, whose brows exalted bear A wrath impatient, and a fiercer air? Awake to all that injur'd worth can feel, On his own Rome he turns th'avenging steel. Yet shall not War's insatiate fury fall, (So heav'n ordains it) on the destin'd wall. See the fond mother 'midst the plaintive train Hung on his knees, and prostrate on the plain! Touch'd to the soul, in vain he strives to hide The son's affection, in the Roman's pride: O'er all the man conflicting passions rise, Rage grasps the sword, while Pity melts the eyes. Thus, gen'rous Critick, as thy Bard inspires, The sister Arts shall nurse their drooping fires; Each from his scenes her stores alternate bring, Blend the fair tints, or wake the vocal string: Those Sibyl-leaves, the sport of ev'ry wind, (For poets ever were a careless kind) By thee dispos'd, no farther toil demand, But, just to Nature, own thy forming hand. So spread o'er Greece, th'harmonious whole unknown, Ev'n Homer's numbers charm'd by parts alone. Their own Ulysses scarce had wander'd more, By winds and water cast on ev'ry shore: When rais'd by Fate, some former Hanmer join'd Each beauteous image of the boundless mind: And bade, like thee, his Athens ever claim A fond alliance with the Poet's name. A SONG FROM SHAKESPEAR's CYMBELINE. Sung by Guiderus and Arviragus over Fidele, supposed to be dead. By the Same. I To fair Fidele's grassy tomb Soft maids, and village hinds shall bring Each op'ning sweet, of earliest bloom, And rifle all the breathing Spring. II No wailing ghost shall dare appear To vex with shrieks this quiet grove: But shepherd lads assemble here, And melting virgins own their love. III No wither'd witch shall here be seen, No goblins lead their nightly crew: The female fays shall haunt the green, And dress thy grave with pearly dew! IV The red-breast oft at ev'ning hours Shall kindly lend his little aid: With hoary moss, and gather'd flow'rs, To deck the ground where thou art laid. V When howling winds, and beating rain, In tempests shake the sylvan cell: Or 'midst the chace on ev'ry plain, The tender thought on thee shall dwell. VI Each lonely scene shall thee restore, For thee the tear be duly shed: Belov'd, till life could charm no more; And mourn'd, till Pity's self be dead. ELEGY To Miss D? W?D. In the Manner of Ovid. By the late Mr. HAMMOND. O say, thou dear possessor of my breast, Where now's my boasted liberty and rest! Where the gay moments which I once have known, O where that heart I fondly thought my own! From place to place I solitary roam, Abroad uneasy, nor content at home. I scorn the beauties common eyes adore, The more I view them, feel thy worth the more; Unmov'd I hear them speak, or see them fair, And only think on thee—who art not there. In vain would books their formal succour lend, Nor wit, nor wisdom can relieve their friend; Wit can't deceive the pain I now endure, And wisdom shews the ill without the cure. When from thy sight I waste the tedious day, A thousand schemes I form, and things to say; But when thy presence gives the time I seek, My heart's so full, I wish, but cannot speak. And cou'd I speak with eloquence and ease, Till now not studious of the art to please, Cou'd I, at woman who so oft exclaim, Expose (nor blush) thy triumph and my shame, Abjure those maxims I so lately priz'd, And court that sex I foolishly despis'd, Own thou hast soften'd my obdurate mind, And thou reveng'd the wrongs of womankind: Lost were my words, and fruitless all my pain, In vain to tell thee all I write in vain; My humble sighs shall only reach thy ears, And all my eloquence shall be my tears. And now (for more I never must pretend) Hear me not as thy lover, but thy friend; Thousands will fain thy little heart ensnare, For without danger none like thee are fair; But wisely chuse who best deserves thy flame, So shall the choice itself become thy fame; Nor yet despise, tho' void of winning art, The plain and honest courtship of the heart: The skilful tongue in love's persuasive lore, Tho' less it feels, will please and flatter more, And meanly learned in that guilty trade Can long abuse a fond, unthinking maid. And since their lips, so knowing to deceive, Thy unexperienc'd youth might soon believe, And since their tears in false submission drest Might thaw the icy coldness of thy breast, O! shut thine eyes to such deceitful woe; Caught by the beauty of thy outward show, Like me they do not love, whate'er they seem, Like me—with passion founded on esteem. Answer to the foregoing Lines. By the late Lord HERVEY. Too well these lines that fatal truth declare, Which long I've known, yet now I blush to hear. But say, what hopes thy fond ill-fated love, What can it hope, tho' mutual it shou'd prove? This little form is fair in vain for you, In vain for me thy honest heart is true; For wou'd'st thou fix dishonour on my name, And give me up to penitence and shame; Or gild my ruin with the name of wife, And make me a poor virtuous wretch for life: Cou'd'st thou submit to wear the marriage chain, (Too sure a cure for all thy present pain) No saffron robe for us the godhead wears, His torch inverted, and his face in tears. Tho' ev'ry softer wish were amply crown'd, Love soon wou'd cease to smile where Fortune frown'd; Then wou'd thy soul my fond consent deplore, And blame what it sollicited before; Thy own exhausted would reproach my truth, And say I had undone thy blinded youth; That I had damp'd Ambition's nobler flame, Eclips'd thy talents, and obscur'd thy fame; To madrigals and odes that wit confin'd, That wou'd in senates or in courts have shin'd. Gloriously active in thy country's cause, Asserting freedom, and enacting laws. Or say, at best, that negatively kind You only mourn'd, and silently repin'd; The jealous dæmons in my own fond breast Wou'd all these thoughts incessantly suggest, And all that sense must feel, tho' pity had supprest. Yet added grief my apprehension fills (If there can be addition to those ills) When they shall cry, whose harsh reproof I dread, “'Twas thy own deed, thy folly on thy head!” Age knows not to allow for thoughtless youth, Nor pities tenderness, nor honours truth; Holds it romantic to confess a heart, And say those virgins act a wiser a wiser part Who hospitals and bedlams wou'd explore To find the rich, and only dread the poor; Who legal prostitutes, for int'rest sake, Clodios and Timons to their bosoms take, And, if avenging heav'n permit increase, People the world with folly and disease. Those, titles, deeds, and rent-rolls only wed, Whilst the best bidder mounts the venal bed, And the grave aunt and formal sire approve This nuptial sale, this auction of their love. But if regard to worth or sense be shown, That poor degenerate child her friends disown, Who dares to deviate by a virtuous choice From her great name's hereditary vice. These scenes my prudence ushers to my mind, Of all the storms and quicksands I must find, If I embark upon this summer sea, Where Flatt'ry smooths, and Pleasure gilds the way. Had our ill fate ne'er blown thy dang'rous flame Beyond the limits of a friend's cold name, I might upon that score thy heart receive, And with that guiltless name my own deceive; That commerce now in vain you recommend, I dread the latent lover in the friend; Of ignorance I want the poor excuse, And know, I both must take, or both refuse. Hear then the safe, the firm resolve I make, Ne'er to encourage one I must forsake. Whilst other maids a shameless path pursue, Neither to int'rest, nor to honour true, And proud to swell the triumph of their eyes, Exult in love from lovers they despise; Their maxims all revers'd I mean to prove, And tho' I like the lover, quit the love. EPISTLES in the Manner of Ovid. MONIMIA to PHILOCLES. By the Same. Since language never can describe my pain, How can I hope to move when I complain? But such is woman's frenzy in distress, We love to plead, tho' hopeless of redress. Perhaps, affecting ignorance, thou'lt say, From whence these lines? whose message to convey? Mock not my grief with that feign'd cold demand, Too well you know the hapless writer's hand: But if you force me to avow my shame, Behold it prefac'd with Monimia's name. Lost to the world, abandon'd and forlorn, Expos'd to infamy, reproach, and scorn, To mirth and comfort lost, and all for you, Yet lost, perhaps, to your remembrance too, How hard my lot! what refuge can I try, Weary of life, and yet afraid to die! Of hope, the wretch's last resort, bereft, By friends, by kindred, by my lover, left. Oh! frail dependence of confiding fools! On lovers oaths, or friendship's sacred rules, How weak in modern heats, too late I find, Monimia's faln, and Philocles unkind! To these reflections, each slow wearing day, And each revolving night a constant prey, Think what I suffer, nor ungentle hear What madness dictates in my fond despair; Grudge not this short relief, (too fast it flies) Nor chide that weakness I myself despise. One moment sure may be at least her due, Who sacrific'd her all of life for you. Without a frown this farewel then receive, For, 'tis the last my hapless love shall give; Nor this I wou'd, if reason cou'd command, But what restriction reins a lover's hand? Nor prudence, shame, nor pride, nor int'rest sways, The hand implicitly the heart obeys: Too well this maxim has my conduct shewn, Too well that conduct to the world is known. Oft have I writ, and often to the flame Condemn'd this after-witness of my shame; Oft in my cooler recollected thought, Thy beauties, and my fondness half forgot, (How short those intervals for reason's aid!) Thus to myself in anguish have I said. Thy vain remonstrance, foolish maid, give o'er, Who act the wrong, can ne'er that wrong deplore. Then sanguine hopes again delusive reign, I form'd thee melting, as I tell my pain. If not of rock thy flinty heart is made, Nor tygers nurs'd thee in the desart shade, Let me at least thy cold compassion prove, That slender sustenance of greedy love: Tho' no return my warmer wishes find, Be to the wretch, tho' not the mistress, kind; Nor whilst I court my melancholy state, Forget 'twas love, and thee, that wrought my fate. Without restraint habituate to range, The paths of pleasure; can I bear this change? Doom'd from the world unwilling to retire, In bloom of life, and warm with young desire, In lieu of roofs with regal splendor gay, Condemn'd in distant wilds to drag the day; Where beasts of prey maintain their savage court, Or human brutes (the worst of brutes) resort. Yes, yes, the change I cou'd unsighing see, For none I mourn, but what I find in thee, There center all my woes, thy heart estrang'd, I weep my lover, not my fortune, chang'd; Bless'd with thy presence, I could all forget, Nor gilded palaces in huts regret, But exil'd thence, superfluous is the rest, Each place the same, my hell is in my breast; To pleasure dead, and living but to pain, My only sense to suffer, and complain. As all my wrongs distressful I repeat, Say, can thy pulse with equal cadence beat? Can'st thou know peace? is conscience mute within? That upright delegate for secret sin; Is nature so extinguish'd in thy heart, That not one spark remains to take my part? Not one repentant throb, one grateful sigh? Thy breast unruffled, and unwet thy eye? Thou cool betrayer, temperate in ill! Thou nor remorse, nor thought humane can'st feel: Nature has form'd thee of the rougher kind, And education more debas'd thy mind, Born in an age when guilt and fraud prevail, When Justice sleeps, and Int'rest holds the scale; Thy loose companions a licentious crew, Most to each other, all to us untrue, Whom chance, or habit mix, but rarely choice, Nor leagu'd in friendship, but in social vice, Who indigent of honour, or of shame, Glory in crimes which others blush to name; By right or wrong disdaining to be mov'd, Unprincipled, unloving, and unlov'd. The fair who trusts their prostituted vows, If not their falshood, still their boasts expose; Nor knows the wisest to elude the harm, Ev'n she whose prudence shuns the tinsel charm They know to slander, though they fail to warm: They make her languish in fictitious flame, Affix some specious slander on her name, And baffled by her virtue, triumph o'er her fame. These are the leaders of thy blinded youth, These vile seducers laugh'd thee out of truth; Whose scurril jests all solemn ties profane, Or Friendship's band, or Hymen's sacred chain; Morality as weakness they upbraid, Nor e'en revere Religion's hallow'd head; Alike they spurn divine and human laws, And treat the honest like the christian cause. Curse on that tongue whose vile pernicious art Delights the ear but to corrupt the heart, That takes advantage of the chearful hour, When weaken'd Virtue bends to Nature's pow'r, And would the goodness of the soul efface, To substitute dishonour in her place. With such you lose the day in false delights, In lewd debauch you revel out the nights, (O fatal commerce to Monimia's peace!) Their arguments convince because they please; Whilst sophistry for reason they admit, And wander dazzled by the glare of wit, Wit that on ill a specious lustre throws, And in false colours ev'ry object shows, That gilds the wrong, depreciating the right, And hurts the judgment, while it feasts the sight; So in the prism to the deluded eye Each pictur'd trifle takes a rainbow dye, With borrow'd charms the shining prospect glows, And truth revers'd the faithless mirror shows, Inverted scenes in bright confusion lie, The lawns impending o'er the nether sky; No just, no real images we meet, But all the gaudy vision is deceit. Oft I revolve in this distracted mind Each word, each look, that spoke my charmer kind; But oh! how dear their memory I pay! What pleasures past can present cares allay? Of all I love for ever dispossess'd: Ah! what avails to think I once was bless'd? Hard disposition of unequal fate! Mix'd are our joys, and transient are their date; Nor can reflection bring them back again, Yet brings an after-sting to ev'ry pain. Thy fatal letters, oh immoral youth, Those perjur'd pledges of fictitious truth, Dear as they were no second joy afford, My cred'lous heart once leap'd at ev'ry word, My glowing bosom throbb'd with thick-heav'd sighs, And floods of rapture gush'd into my eyes: When now repeated (for thy theft was vain, Each treasur'd syllable my thoughts retain) Far other passions rule, and diff'rent care, My joys and grief, my transports and despair. Why dost thou mock the ties of constant love? But half its joys the faithless ever prove, They only taste the pleasures they receive, When sure the noblest is in those we give. Acceptance is the heav'n which mortals know, But 'tis the bliss of angels to bestow. Oh! emulate, my love, that task divine, Be thou that angel, and that heav'n be mine. Yes, yet relent, yet intercept my fate: Alas! I rave, and sue for new deceit. As soon the dead shall from the grave return, As love extinguish'd with new ardor burn. Oh! that I dar'd to act a Roman part, And stab thy image in this faithful heart, Where riveted for life secure you reign, A cruel inmate, author of my pain: But coward-like irresolute I wait Time's tardy aid, nor dare to rush on fate; Perhaps may linger on life's latest stage, Survey thy cruelties, and fall by age: No—grief shall swell my sails, and speed me o'er (Despair my pilot) to that quiet shore Where I can trust, and thou betray no more. Might I but once again behold thy charms, Might I but breathe my last in those dear arms, On that lov'd face but fix my closing eye, Permitted where I might not live to die, My soften'd fate I wou'd accuse no more; But fate has no such happiness in store. 'Tis past, 'tis done—what gleam of hope behind, When I can ne'er be false, nor thou be kind? Why then this care?—'tis weak—'tis vain—farewel— At that last word what agonies I feel! I faint—I die—remember I was true— 'Tis all I ask—eternally—adieu!— FLORA to POMPEY. By the Same. Pompey, when he was very young, fell in love with Flora, a Roman courtezan, who was so very beautiful that the Romans had her painted to adorn the temple of Castor and Pollux. Geminius (Pompey's friend) afterwards fell in love with her too; but she, prepossessed with a passion for Pompey, would not listen to Geminius. Pompey, in compassion to his friend, yielded him his mistress, which Flora took so much to heart, that she fell dangerously ill upon it; and in that sickness is supposed to write the following letter to Pompey. Ere death these closing eyes for ever shade, (That death thy cruelties have welcome made) Receive, thou yet lov'd man! this one adieu, This last farewel to happiness and you. My eyes o'erflow with tears, my trembling hand Can scarce the letters form, or pen command: The dancing paper swims before my sight, And scarce myself can read the words I write. Think you behold me in this lost estate, And think yourself the author of my fate: How vast the change! your Flora's now become The gen'ral pity, not the boast of Rome. This form, a pattern to the sculptor's art, This face, the idol once of Pompey's heart, (Whose pictur'd beauties Rome thought fit to place The sacred temples of her gods to grace) Are charming now no more; the bloom is fled, The lillies languid, and the roses dead. Soon shall some hand the glorious work deface, Where Grecian pencils tell what Flora was: No longer my resemblance they impart, They lost their likeness, when I lost thy heart. Oh! that those hours could take their turn again, When Pompey, lab'ring with a jealous pain, His Flora thus bespoke: “Say, my dear love! “Shall all these rivals unsuccessful prove? “In vain, for ever, shall the Roman youth “Envy my happiness, and tempt thy truth? “Shall neither tears nor pray'rs thy pity move? “Ah! give not pity, 'tis akin to love. “Would Flora were not fair in such excess, “That I might fear, tho' not adore her less.” Fool that I was, I sought to ease that grief, Nor knew indiff'rence follow'd the relief: Experience taught the cruel truth too late, I never dreaded, till I found my fate. 'Twas mine to ask if Pompey's self could hear, Unmov'd, his rival's unsuccessful pray'r; To make thee swear he'd not thy pity move; Alas! such pity is no kin to love. 'Twas thou thyself (ungrateful as thou art!) Bade me unbend the rigour of my heart: You chid my faith, reproach'd my being true, (Unnat'ral thought!) and labour'd to subdue The constancy my soul maintain'd for you; To other arms your mistress you condemn'd, Too cool a lover, and too warm a friend. How could'st thou thus my lavish heart abuse, To ask the only thing it could refuse? Nor yet upbraid me, Pompey, what I say, For 'tis my merit that I can't obey; Yet this alledg'd against me as a fault, Thy rage fomented, and my ruin wrought. Just gods! what tye, what conduct can prevail O'er fickle man, when truth like mine can fail? Urge not, to gloss thy crime, the name of friend, We know how far those sacred laws extend; Since other heroes have not blush'd to prove How weak all passions when oppos'd to love: Nor boast the virtuous conflict of thy heart When gen'rous pity took Geminius' part; 'Tis all heroic fraud, and Roman art. Such flights of honour might amuse the crowd, But by a mistress ne'er can be allow'd; Keep for the senate, and the grave debate, That infamous hypocrisy of state: There words are virtue, and your trade deceit. No riddle is thy change, nor hard t'explain; Flora was fond, and Pompey was a man: No longer then a specious tale pretend, Nor plead fictitious merit to your friend: By nature false, you follow'd her decree, Nor gen'rous are to him, but false to me. You say you melted at Geminius' tears, You say you felt his agonizing cares: Gross artifice, that this from him could move, And not from Flora, whom you say you love: You could not bear to hear your rival sigh, Yet bear unmov'd to see your mistress die. Inhuman hypocrite! nor thus can he My wrongs, and my distress, obdurate, see. He, who receiv'd, condemns the gift you made, And joins with me the giver to upbraid, Forgetting he's oblig'd, and mourning I'm betray'd. He loves too well that cruel gift to use, Which Pompey lov'd too little to refuse: Fain would he call my vagrant lord again, But I the kind ambassador restrain; I scorn to let another take my part, And to myself will owe or lose thy heart. Can nothing e'er rekindle love in thee? Can nothing e'er extinguish it in me? That I could tear thee from this injur'd breast! And where you gave my person, give the rest, At once to grant and punish thy request. That I could place thy worthy rival there! No second insult need my fondness fear; He views not Flora with her Pompey's eyes, He loves like me, he doats, despairs, and dies. Come to my arms, thou dear deserving youth! Thou prodigy of man! thou man with truth! For him, I will redouble every care, To please, for him, these faded charms repair; To crown his vows, and sharpen thy despair. Oh! 'tis illusion all! and idle rage! No second passion can this heart engage; And shortly, Pompey, shall thy Flora prove, Death may dissolve, but nothing change her love. ARISBE to MARIUS Junior. From Fontenelle. By the Same. When Marius was expelled from Rome by Sylla's faction, and retired into Africa, his son (who accompany'd him) fell into the hands of Hiempsal king of Numidia, who kept him prisoner. One of the mistresses of that king fell in love with Marius junior, and was so generous to contrive and give him his liberty, though by that means she sacrificed her love for ever. 'Twas after he had rejoin'd his father, that she writ him the following letter. I Of all I valued, all I lov'd, bereft, Say, has my heart this little comfort left? That you the mem'ry of its truth retain, And think with grateful pity on my pain? II Tho' but with life my sorrows can have end, (For death alone can join me to my friend) Yet think not I repent I set you free, I mourn your absence, not your liberty. III Before my Marius left Numidia's coast, Each day I saw him; scarce an hour was lost: Now months and years must pass, nay life shall prove But one long absence from the man I love. IV Painful reflection! poyson to my mind! Was it but mortal too, it would be kind: But mad with grief I search the palace round, And in that madness dream you're to be found. V Would'st thou believe it? to those walls I fly Where thou wert captive held; there frantick cry, These fetters sure my vagrant's flight restrain'd; Alas! these setters I myself unchain'd. VI The live-long day I mourn, I loath the light, And wait impatient each returning night: What, tho' the horrid gloom augment my grief? 'Tis grateful still, for I disclaim relief. VII That coz'ner hope intrudes not on my woe; One only interval my sorrows know; When dreams, the kind reversers of my pain, Bring back my charming fugitive again. VIII Yet there's a grief surpassing all the rest; A jealous dæmon whispers in my breast, Marius was false, for liberty alone The show of love the hypocrite put on. IX Then I reflect (ah! would I could forget!) How much your thoughts on war and Rome were set. How little passion did that conduct prove! Too strong thy reason, but too weak thy love. X Thy sword, 'tis true, a father's cause demands; But 'twas a mistress gave it to thy hands: To love, and duty just, give each their part, His be the arm, and mine be all thy heart. XI But what avail these thoughts? fond wretch, give o'er! Marius, or false, or true, is thine no more: Since Fate has cast the lot, and we must part, Why should I wish to think I had his heart? XII Yes: let me cherish that remembrance still; That thought alone shall soften ev'ry ill; To tell my soul, his love, his truth was such, All was his due, nor have I done too much. XIII Deceitful comfort! let me not persuade My cred'lous heart its fondness was repaid; It makes my soul with double anguish mourn Those joys, which never, never must return. XIV Perhaps ev'n you what most I wish oppose, And in the Roman all the lover lose: I'm a Numidian, and your soul disdains To bear th'inglorious weight of foreign chains. XV Can any climate then so barb'rous prove, To stand excluded from the laws of Love? His empire's universal, unconfin'd, His proxy beauty, and his slaves mankind. XVI Nor am I a Numidian but by name, For I can int'rest for my love disclaim: My virtue shows what 'twas the gods design'd, By chance on Africk's clay they stamp'd a Roman mind. XVII Not all the heroes which your Rome can boast, So much for fame, as I for you have lost: Yourself I lost: oh! grateful, then confess, My tryal greater, tho' my glory less. XVIII Yes, partial gods! inflicters of my care! Be witness what I felt, what grief, what fear! When full of stifled woes the night he fled, No sigh I dar'd to breathe, no tear to shed. XIX Whilst men of faith approv'd, a chosen crew, Firm to their trust, and to their mistress true, With care too punctual my commands obey, And in one freight my life and thee convey. XX The harder task was mine; condemn'd to bear With brow serene, my agonizing care; To mix in idle talk, to force a smile, A king and jealous lover to beguile. XXI Think in that dreadful interval of fate, All I held dear, thy safety in debate, Think what I suffer'd, whilst my heart afraid Suggests a thousand times, that's all betray'd. XXII A thousand times revolving in my mind The doubtful chance; oh! Love! said I, be kind: Propitious to my scheme, thy vot'ry aid, And be my fondness by success repaid. XXIII Now bolder grown, with sanguine hopes elate, My fancy represents thy smiling fate; The guards deceiv'd, and ev'ry danger o'er, The winds already waft him from the shore. XXIV These pleasing images anew impart Life to my eyes, and gladness to my heart; Dispel the gloomy fears that cloud my face, And charm the little flutterer to peace. XXV But now the king, or tasteless to my charms, Or weary of an absent mistress' arms, His own apartment seeks, and grateful rest; That courted stranger to the careful breast. XXVI Whilst I, by hopes and fears alternate sway'd, Impatient ask the slaves if I'm obey'd. 'Tis done, they cry'd, and struck me with despair; For what I long'd to know, I dy'd to hear. XXVII Fantastick turn of a distracted mind; I blam'd the gods for having been too kind; Curs'd the success they granted to my vows, And this assistant hand that fill'd my woes. XXVIII Such was my frenzy in that hour of care, And such th'injustice of my bold despair; That even those, ungrateful I upbraid, Whose fatal diligence my will obey'd. XXIX Scarce, Marius, did thyself escape my rage; (Most lov'd of men!) when fears of black presage Describe thy heart so fond of liberty, It never gave one parting throb for me. XXX At every step you should have turn'd your eye, Dropt a regretful tear, and heav'd a sigh; The nature of the grace I shew'd was such, You not deserv'd it, if it pleas'd too much. XXXI A lover would have linger'd as he fled, And oft in anguish to himself have said, Farewel for ever! Ah! yet more he'd done, A lover never would have fled alone. XXXII To force me from a hated rival's bed, Why comes not Marius at an army's head? Oh! did thy heart but wish to see that day, 'Twould all my past, and future woes o'er-pay. XXXIII But vain are all these hopes: preserve thy breast From falshood only, I forgive the rest: Too happy, if no envy'd rival boast Those joys Arisbe for her Marius lost. ROXANA to USBECK. From Les Lettres Persannes. By the Same. Roxana, one of Usbeck's wives, was found (whilst he was in Europe) in bed with her lover, whom she had privately let into the seraglio. The guardian eunuch who discovered them, had the man murdered on the spot, and her close guarded till be received instructions from his master how to dispose of her. During that interval she swallowed poyson, and is supposed to write the following letter whilst she is dying. Think not I write my innocence to prove, To sue for pity, or awake thy love: No mean defence expect, or abject pray'rs; Thou know'st no mercy, and I know no tears: I laugh at all thy vengeance has decreed, Avow the fact, and glory in the deed. Yes, tyrant! I deceiv'd thy spies and thee: Pleas'd in oppression, and in bondage free: The rigid agents of thy cruel laws By gold I won to aid my juster cause: With dextrous skill eluded all thy care, And acted more than jealousy could fear: To wanton bow'rs this prison-house I turn'd, And bless'd that absence which you thought I mourn'd. But short those joys allow'd by niggard Fate, Yet so refin'd, so exquisitely great, That their excess compensated their date. I die: already in each burning vein I feel the poys'nous draught, and bless the pain: For what is life unless its joys we prove? And where is joy, depriv'd of what we love? Yet, ere I die, this justice I have paid To my dear murder'd lover's injur'd shade: Those sacrilegious instruments of power, Who wrought that ruin these sad eyes deplore, Already with their blood their crimes attone, And for his life have sacrific'd their own. Thee, tho' restraint and absence may defend From my revenge, my curses still attend: Despair like mine, barbarian! be thy part, Remorse afflict, and sorrow sting thy heart. Nor think this hate commencing in my breast, Tho' prudence long its latent force suppress'd; I knew those wrongs that I was forc'd to bear, And curs'd those chains Injustice made me wear. For could'st thou hope Roxana to deceive With idle tales, which only fools believe? Poor abject souls in superstition bred, In ign'rance train'd, by prejudice misled; Whom hireling dervises by proxy teach From those whose false prerogative they preach. Didst thou imagine me so weak of mind, Because I murmur'd not, I ne'er repin'd, But hugg'd my chain, and thought my jaylor kind? That willingly those laws I e'er obey'd, Which Pride invented, and Oppression made? And whilst self-licens'd through the world you rove, To quicken appetite by change in love; Each passion sated, and each wish possess'd That Lust can urge, or Fancy can suggest: That I should mourn thy loss with fond regret, Weep the misfortune, and the wrong forget? Could I believe that heav'n this beauty gave, (Thy transient pleasure, and thy lasting slave;) Indu'd with reason, only to fulfil The harsh commands of thy capricious will? No, Usbeck, no, my soul disdain'd those laws; And tho' I wanted pow'r t'assert my cause, My right I knew; and still those pleasures sought, Which Justice warranted, and Nature taught: On Custom's senseless precepts I refin'd, I weigh'd what heav'n, I knew what man design'd, And form'd by her own rules my free-born mind. Thus whilst this wretched body own'd thy pow'r, Doom'd, unredress'd, its hardships to deplore; My soul subservient to herself alone, And Reason independent on her throne, Contemn'd thy dictates, and obey'd their own. Yet thus far to my conduct thanks are due, At least I condescended to seem true; Endeavour'd still my sentiments to hide, Indulg'd thy vanity, and sooth'd thy pride. Tho' this submission to a tyrant paid, Whom not my duty, but my fears obey'd, If rightly weigh'd, would more deserve thy blame, Who call it Virtue, but prophane her name: For to the world I should have own'd that love, Which all impartial judges must approve: You urg'd a right to tyrannize my heart, Which he solliciting, assail'd by art, Whilst I, impatient of the name of slave, To force refus'd, what I to merit gave. Oft, as thy slaves this wretched body led To the detested pleasures of thy bed; In those soft moments, consecrate to joy, Which extacy and transport should employ; Clasp'd in your arms, you wonder'd still to find So cold my kisses, so compos'd my mind: But had thy cheated eyes discern'd aright, You'd found aversion, where you sought delight. Not that my soul incapable of love, No charms could warm, no tenderness could move; For him, whose love my every thought possess'd, A fiercer passion fill'd this constant breast, Than truth e'er felt, or falshood e'er possess'd. This stile unusual to thy pride appears, For truth's a stranger to the tyrant's ears; But what have I to manage or to dread? Nor threats alarm, nor insults hurt the dead; No wrongs they feel, no miseries they find; Cares are the legacies we leave behind: In the calm grave no Usbecks we deplore, No tyrant husband, no oppressive pow'r. Alas! I faint—Death intercepts the rest: The venom'd drug is busy in my breast: Each nerve's unstrung: a mist obscures the day: My senses, strength, and ev'n my hate decay: Tho' rage awhile the ebbing spirits stay'd, 'Tis past—they sink beneath the transient aid. Take then, inhuman wretch! my last farewel; Pain be thy portion here, hereafter, hell: And when our prophet shall my fate decree, Be any curse my punishment, but thee. EPILOGUE design'd for Sophonisba, And to have been spoken by Mrs. Oldfield. By the Same. Before you sign poor Sophonisba's doom, In her behalf petitioner I come; Not but our author knows, whate'er I say, That I could find objections to his play. This double marriage for her country's good, I told him never would be understood, And that ye all would say, 'twas flesh and blood. Had Carthage only been in madam's head, Her champion never had been in her—bed: For could the ideot think a husband's name Would make him quit his interest, friends and fame; That he would risque a kingdom for a wife, And act dependent in a place for life? Yet when stern Cato shall condemn the fair, Whilst publick good she thunder'd in your ear, If private interest had a little share. You know, she acted not against the laws Of those old-fashion'd times; that in her cause Old Syphax could no longer make a stand, And Massinissa woo'd her sword in hand. But did not take the way to whet that sword; Heroes fight coldly when wives give the word. She should have kept him keen, employ'd her charms Not as a bribe, but to reward his arms; Have told him when Rome yielded she would yield, And sent him fresh, not yawning, to the field. She talk'd it well to rouse him to the fight, But like Penelope, when out of sight, All she had done by day, undid by night. Is this your wily Carthaginian kind? No English woman had been half so kind. What from a husband's hand could she expect But ratsbane, or that common fate, neglect Perhaps some languishing soft fair may say, Poyson's so shocking—but consider pray, She fear'd the Roman, he the marriage chain; All other means to free them both were vain. Let none then Massinissa's conduct blame, He first his love consulted, then his fame. And if the fair one with too little art, Whilst seemingly she play'd a patriot-part, Was secretly the dupe of her own heart; Forgive a fault she strove so well to hide, Nor be compassion to her fate deny'd, Who liv'd unhappily, and greatly dy'd. An Imitation of the Eleventh Ode of the First Book of Horace. By the Same. Forbear, my dear Stephen, with a fruitless desire Into truths which are better conceal'd to enquire; Perhaps many years are allow'd us by Fate, Or next winter perhaps is the last of their date: Let the credulous fools whom astrologers cheat, Exult or despond, as they vary deceit; Who anticipate care, their own pleasure destroy, And invite disappointment who build upon joy; All ills unforeseen we the easiest endure, What avails to foresee, unless foresight could cure? And from ills by their art how can wretches be freed, When that art must be false, or those ills be decreed? From reflection and hope little comfort we find, To possession alone let thy thoughts be confin'd; To-day's all the treasure poor mortals can boast, For to-morrow's not gained, and yesterday's lost; Even now whilst I write, time steals on our youth, And a moment's cut off from my friendship and truth: Then seize the swift blessing, enjoy the dear now, And take, not expect, what hereafter 'll bestow. A LOVE LETTER. By the Same. What shall I say to fix thy wav'ring mind, To chase thy doubts, and force thee to be kind? What weight of argument can turn the scale, If intercession from a lover fail? By what shall I conjure thee to obey This tender summons, nor prolong thy stay? If unabated in this constant breast That passion burns which once thy vows profess'd; If absence has not chill'd the languid flame, Its ardour and its purity the same; Indulge those transports, and no more controul The dictates of thy fond consenting soul; By no vain scruple be thy purpose sway'd, And only Love implicitly obey'd: Let inclination this debate decide, Nor be thy prudence, but thy heart thy guide: But real prudence never can oppose What Love suggests, and Gratitude avows: The warm dear raptures which thy bosom move, 'Tis virtue to indulge, 'tis wisdom to improve: For think how few the joys allow'd by Fate, How mix'd the cup, how short their longest date! How onward still the stream of pleasure flows! That no reflux the rapid current knows! Not ev'n thy charms can bribe the ruthless hand Of rigid Time, to stay his ebbing sand; Fair as thou art, that beauty must decay; The night of age succeeds the brightest day: That check where Nature's sweetest garden blows, Her whitest lily, and her warmest rose; Those eyes, those meaning ministers of Love, Who, what thy lips can only utter, prove; These must resign their lustre, those their bloom, And find with meaner charms one common doom: Pass but a few short years, this change must be; Nor one less dreadful shalt thou mourn in me: For tho' no chance can alienate my flame, While thine to feed the lamp, shall burn the same, Yet shall the stream of years abate that fire, And cold esteem succeed to warm desire: Then on thy breast unraptur'd shall I dwell, Nor feel a joy beyond what I can tell. Or say, should sickness antedate that woe, And intercept what Time would else allow; If pain should pall my taste to all thy charms, Or Death himself should tear me from thy arms; How would'st thou then regret with fruitless truth, The precious squander'd hours of health and youth? Come then, my love, nor trust the future day, Live whilst we can, be happy whilst we may: For what is life unless its joys we prove? And what is happiness but mutual love? Our time is wealth no frugal hand can store, All our possession is the present hour, And he who spares to use it, ever poor. The golden now is all that we can boast; And that (like snow) at once is grasp'd and lost. Haste, wing thy passage then, no more delay, But to these eyes their sole delight convey. Not thus I languish'd for thy virgin charms, When first surrender'd to these eager arms, When first admitted to that heav'n, thy breast, To mine I strain'd that charming foe to rest; How leaps my conscious heart, whilst I retrace The dear idea of that strict embrace? When on thy bosom quite entranc'd I lay, And love unsated the short night away; Whilst half reluctant you, and half resign'd, Amidst fears, wishes, pain and pleasure join'd, Now holding off, now growing to my breast, By turns reprov'd me, and by turns caress'd. Oh! how remembrance throbs in every vein! I pant, I sicken for that scene again; My senses ach, I can no word command, And the pen totters in my trembling hand. Farewel, thou only joy on earth I know, And all that man can taste of heav'n below. This little poem was, among several others on the same occasion, printed by Dr. Rogers, with his inaugural exercise at Padua; and afterwards in the same manner re-published by him at London, together with his Harveian oration before the college of physicians, in the year 1682; while Mr. Waller was yet living.VERSES to Dr. George Rogers, on his taking the Degree of Doctor in Physic at Padua, in the Year 1664. By Mr. WALLER. When as of old the earth's bold children strove, With hills on hills, to scale the throne of Jove; Pallas and Mars stood by their sovereign's side, And their bright arms in his defence employ'd: While the wise Phœbus, Hermes, and the rest, Who joy in peace and love the Muses best, Descending from their so distemper'd seat, Our groves and meadows chose for their retreat. There first Apollo tried the various use Of herbs, and learn'd the virtue of their juice, And fram'd that art, to which who can pretend A juster title than our noble friend, Whom the like tempest drives from his abode, And like employment entertains abroad? This crowns him here; and, in the bays so earn'd, His country's honour is no less concern'd; Since it appears, not all the English rave, To ruin bent: some study how to save. And as Hippocrates did once extend His sacred art, whole cities to amend; So we, brave friend, suppose that thy great skill, Thy gentle mind, and fair example will, At thy return, reclaim our frantic isle, Their spirits calm; and peace again shall smile. Edm. Waller, Anglus Patavii, typis Pauli Frambotti. VIRGIL's Tomb. Naples 1741. ? Tenues ignavo Pollio chordas Pulso; Maroneique redens in margine templi Suæ animum, &amp; magni tumulis adcanto magistri. Stat. I came, great bard, to gaze upon thy shrine, And o'er thy relicks wait th'inspiring Nine: For sure, I said, where Maro's ashes sleep, The weeping Muses must their vigils keep: Still o'er their fav'rite's monument they mourn, And with poetic trophies grace his urn: Have placed the shield and martial trumpet here; The shepherd's pipe, and rural honours there: Fancy had deck'd the consecrated ground, And scatter'd never-fading roses round. And now my bold romantic thought aspires To hear the echo of celestial lyres; Then catch some sound to bear delighted home, And boast I learnt the verse at Virgil's tomb; Or stretch'd beneath thy myrtle's fragrant shade, With dreams extatic hov'ring o'er my head, See forms august, and laurel'd ghosts ascend, And with thyself, perhaps, the long procession end. I came—but soon the phantoms disappear'd; Far other scenes, than wanton Hope had rear'd; No faery rites, no funeral pomp I found; No trophied walls with wreaths of laurel round: A mean unhonour'd ruin faintly show'd The spot where once thy mausoleum stood: Hardly the form remain'd; a nodding dome O'ergrown with moss is now all Virgil's tomb. 'Twas such a scene as gave a kind relief To memory, in sweetly-pensive grief: Gloomy, unpleasing images it wrought; No musing, soft complacency of thought: For Time had canker'd all, and worn away Ev'n the last, mournful graces of decay: Oblivion, hateful goddess, sate before, And cover'd with her dusky wings the door: No silver harps I heard, no Muse's voice, But birds obscene in horrid notes rejoice: Fancy recoil'd, and with his tinsel train, Forsook the chearless scene; no more remain The warm ambitious hopes of airy youth; Severe Reflection came, and frowning Truth: Away each glitt'ring gay idea fled, And bade a melancholy train succeed, That form'd, or seem'd to form, a mournful call In feeble echoes mutt'ring round the wall. Seek not the Muses here! th'affrighted maids Have fled Parthenope's polluted shades: Her happy shores, the seats of joy and ease, Their fav'rite mansions once, no longer please: No longer, as of old, in transport lost, The sisters rove along th'enchanted coast; They turn with horror from each much-lov'd stream, And loath the fields that were their darling theme: The tuneful names themselves once fondly gave To ev'ry swelling hill, and mossy cave, So pleasing then, are only heard with sighs; And each sad echo bids their sorrow rise. Yet Nature smiles, as when their Virgil sung, Nor 'midst a fairer scene his lyre was strung; Still bloom the sweets of his elysium here, And the same charms in ev'ry grove appear. But ah! in vain indulgent suns prevail; Health and delight in ev'ry balmy gale Are wafted now in vain: small comfort bring To weeping eyes the beauties of the spring. To groaning slaves those fragrant meads belong, Where Tully dictated, and Maro sung. Long since, alas! those golden days are flown, Where here each Science wore its proper crown; Pale Tyranny had laid their altars low, And rent the laurel from the Muse's brow: What wonder then 'midst such a scene to see The Arts expire with bleeding Liberty? Pensive and sad, each fair angelic form Droops, like the wearied dove beneath a storm: Far other views the poet's thought engage, Than the warm glories of th'Augustan age. Can mis'ry bid th'imagination glow? Or genius brighten 'midst domestic woe? To see desponding wretches round him pine, Horace had wept beneath the Alban vine. Sad sits the bard amidst his country's tears, And sighs, regardless of the wreaths he wears. Did ever Want and Famine sweetly sing? The fetter'd hand uncouthly strikes the string. Lo! stern Oppression lifts her iron rod, And Ruin waits th'imperious harpy's nod: Black Desolation, and destructive War, Rise at the signal, and attend her car. From the dire pomp th'affrighted shepherd flies, And leaves his flock the rav'nous soldier's prize. Where now are all the nymphs that blest the plains? Where, the full chorus of contented swains? The songs of love, of liberty and peace, Are heard no more; the dance and tabor cease: To the soft oaten pipe, and past'ral reed, The din of arms, and clarion's blast succeed: Dire shapes appear in ev'ry op'ning glade; And Furies howl where once the Muses stray'd? Is this the queen of realms, for arts renown'd? This captive maid, that weeps upon the ground! Alas! how chang'd!—dejected and forlorn! The mistress of the world become the scorn! Around stand Rapine, Horror and Despair; And Ign'rance, dark ally of barb'rous War: She, at th'usurping Vandal's dread command, Displays her gloomy banner o'er the land: Beneath its chilling shade neglected lies Each sister Art; and unlamented dies. Lo! Sculpture lets her useless chissel fall; While on some ruin'd temple's broken wall Sad Architecture sits; and sees with shame Mis-shapen piles usurp her injur'd name: Music and Verse, unhappy twins! belong To antique Masque, and weak unmanly Song: The gath'ring deluge swells on ev'ry side, And monkish Superstition swells the tide. By the resistless torrent overborn Floats ev'ry Virtue, from its basis torn: Fair Learning droops, the sick'ning Arts decay; And ev'ry laurel fades, and ev'ry bay. All is confus'd, no traces now are seen To shew what wretched Italy has been. Thus once Vesuvius, crown'd with circling wood, Parthenope, thy beauteous neighbour stood: Perpetual Spring cloath'd the fair mountain's side; And what is now thy terror, was thy pride. Sudden th'imprison'd flames burst forth; and laid On smoaky heaps each shrieking Dryad's shade: Now deep in ashes sinks the myrtle bow'r, O'er beds of flow'rs sulphureous torrents roar; And exil'd demi-gods their ruin'd seats deplore. The LINK. A Ballad. Ye ladies that live in the city or town, Fair Winton or Alresford so fine and so gay; And ye neat country lasses in clean linen gown, As neat and as blithe and as pretty as they: Come away strait to Ovington, for you can't think What a charming new walk there is made on the Link. Look how lovely the prospect, the meadows how green, The fields and the woods, in the vale or the hill: The trees, and the cotage that peeps out between, The clear stream that runs bubbling in many a rill, That will show your fair face as you stand on the brink, And murmurs most sweetly all under the Link. How pleasant the morning, how clear the blue sky, How pure the fresh air, and how healthy the place! Your heart goes a pit-a-pat light as a fly, And the blood circles briskly, and glows in your face: Wou'd you paint your fair cheeks with the rose and the pink? Throw your washes away, take a walk on the Link. After dinner the 'squire ere the ladies retreat, Marches off with some friends that will ply the brisk glass; Gives us liquor enough, and a good pleasant seat, And damns your fine taste, and your finical lass: Al fresco, my lads, we'll carouse and we'll drink, Take your bottle each man, and away to the Link. Not so gentle Collin, whom love holds in thrall, To Molly he steals all in silence away; And when nought can be heard but the rude water-fall, And the woodbine breathes sweetest at close of the day, He takes her soft hand, and he tips her the wink, Come, my dear, let us take a cool walk on the Link. But, O ye fair maidens, be sure have a care, Nor lay yourselves open to love's cruel dart; Of the hour and the place and the season beware, And guard well each passage that leads to your heart; Sly Cupid will steal in at some little chink, If you walk in the evening too late on the Link. Ye poets so lofty, who love to retire From the noise of the town to the stream and the wood; Who in epics and tragics, with marvellous fire, Utter sounds by mere mortals not well understood: Here mouthe your loud strain, and here ply pen and ink, Quit Parnassus and Pindus, and come to the Link. And come you, who for thought are at little expence, Who indite gentle pastoral, ballad, or song; You see with smooth numbers, and not too much sense, How the verses run easy and glibly along; And the rhime at the close how it falls with a clink, So kind are the Muses that sport on the Link. THE SQUIRE of DAMES. A POEM. In SPENSER's Stile. ADVERTISEMENT. In the seventh Canto of the Legend of Chastity, in Spenser's Fairy Queen, the Squire of Dames tells Satyrane, that by order of his mistress Columbel (after having served the ladies for a year) he was sent out a second time, not to return till he could find three hundred women incapable of yielding to any temptation. The bad success he met with in the course of the three years, which is slightly touch'd upon by Spenser, is the foundation of the following poem. PROLOGUE. I Hard is the heart that never knew to love, Ne felt the pleasing anguish of desire. Ye British maids, more fair than Venus' dove, For you alone I tune my humble lyre; Adopt me, nymphs, receive me in your quire, Make me your bard; for that is all my care: Then shall I envy not that aged sire, Who doth for court his annual song prepare: I lever myrtle wreath than Kesar's laurel wear. II Think not because I write of Columbel I thence would blast the sex with impious tale; Transactions vile of foreign stronds I tell, Ne 'gainst a British female would I rail For all the wealth that rolls on Indian grail. Here, beauty, truth, and chastity are found: Eleonora here, with visage pale, Did suck the poison from her Edward's wound, And Anna's nuptial faith shall stond for aye renown'd. III See the fair swans on Thamis' lovely tide, The which do trim their pennons silver bright, In shining ranks they down the waters ride; Oft have mine eyes devour'd the gallant sight. Then cast thy looks with wonder and delight, Where yon sweet nymphs enjoy the ev'ning air, Some daunce along the green, like fairies light, Some flow'rets cull to deck their flowing hair; Then tell me, soothly, swain, which sight thou deem'st most fair. IV To you, bright stars, that sparkle on our isle, I give my life, my fortune, and my fame; For my whole guerdon grant me but a smile, A smile from you is all I hope or claim; Nor age's ice my ardent zeal shall tame, To my life's end I shall your names adore, Not hermit's bosoms feel so pure a flame, Warm'd by approval I more high shall soar: Receive my humble lays, my heart was yours before. V Should you consent, I'll quit my shepherd's grey, And don more graceful and more costly gear, My crook and scrip I'll throw with scorn away, And in a samite garment streit appear. Farewell, ye groves, which once I held so dear; Farewell, ye glens, I other joys pursue; Then shall the world your matchless pow'r revere, And own what wonders your sweet smiles can do, That could a simple clown into a bard transmew. CANTO I. ARGUMENT. The Squire of Dames to Satyrane His history doth tell, With all the toils he underwent To gain his Columbel. I The Squire of Dames his tale thus 'gan to tell; Sith you command my tongue, sir Satyrane, I now will all declare that me befell The cause of muchel scath and dol'rous pain, Ne shall thy gentle eye from tears refrain. Me Columbel commanded far to go 'Till I should full three hundred nymphs attain, Whose hearts should aye with Virtue's lessons glow, And to all swains but one cry out for ever, No. II To find the fortilage that ne'er will yield Is not an easy matter, good sir Knight; Troy town, they say, is now a grass-grown field, That long withstood the force of Grecian might; And castles fall tho' deep in earth empight; Ne ought so strong is found but what may fail, The sun at last shall lose his glorious light, And vows or bribes o'er women may prevail; Their hearts are made of flesh, and mortal flesh is frail. III With heavy heart, and full of cark I go And take my congé of my blooming maid, I kiss'd her hond, and, louting very low, To her behest at length myself array'd: The fair we love expects to be obey'd, Altho' she bid us with the kestrel fly; So forth I prick, tho' much by doubt dismay'd, The hard experiment resolv'd to try: For she was wond'rous fair, and much in love was I. IV A grove I reach'd, where tuneful throstles sung, The linnet here did ope his little throat, His twitting jests around the cuckoo flung, And the proud goldfinch show'd his painted coat, And hail'd us with no inharmonious note: The robin eke here tun'd his sonnet shrill, And told the soothing ditty all by rote, How he with leaves his pious beak did fill, To shroud those pretty babes, whom Sib unkind would kill. V And many a fair Narcissus deck'd the plain, That seem'd anew their passions to admire; Here Ajax told his dolors o'er again, And am'rous Clytie sicken'd with desire; Here the blown rose her odors sweet did spire; Thro' the dun grove a murm'ring river led His chrystal streams that wound in many a gyre; The baleful willow all the banks bespread, And ever to the breeze ycurl'd his hoary head. VI Soon to the grove there came a lovely maid, For maiden sure she did to me appear, In plain check-laton was the nymph array'd, Her sparkling eyes stood full of many a tear, And she bewept the absence of her dear. Alas! should beauty be to woe allay'd? Beauty, methinks, should meet with better cheer, Content should never wander from her side; Good luck, I pray to heav'n, the face that's fair betide. VII “Ah! woe is me, she cry'd, since Colin's fled, “Whose gentle presence did these plains adorn, “Soon was he ravish'd from the nuptial bed, “Torn from these arms, from his dear leman torn! “O grief! far sharper than the pointed thorn, “I saw him ill-bestad by martial band. “Alas the day that ever I was born! “Where roves my Colin, on what foreign strand, “Arraught from Laura's eyes, and his dear native land? VIII “Alas! he only knew to prune the vine, “Or thro' the earth to urge the biting share, “To twist the bower with fragrant eglantine, “Where free from heat we shun'd the noon-tide air, “Or to the mart to lead his fleecy care. “And is it fit in hacqueton and mail “The youth for war's grim terrors should prepare! “His voice outsung the love-lorn nightingale, “And destly could he daunce, or pipe along the dale. IX “The gos-hawk fierce may pounce the trembling dove, “The savage wolf may tear the bounding fawn, “But sparrows mild are form'd sor feats of love, “And kids dew not with blood the flow'ry lawn; “Then how shall he, in whom all graces dawn, “In the red field the cruel paynim kill? “For scenes like these find men of hellish spawn. “'Tis his with joy the virgin's heart to fill, “And not on foreign shore his foemen's blood to spill. X “No days of bliss my sorrows shall aslake, “For him I'll ever drop the dol'rous tear. “Adieu the circled green, the buxom wake, “Since Colin's gone I taste of nought but drear. “Stretch me, ye maidens, stretch me on the bier, “And let thy grave-stone these true words adorn: “A wretched maiden lies intombed here, “Who saw a shepherd brighter than the morn, “Then pin'd her heart away, and dy'd of love forlorn.” XI Much was I grieved at her piteous plaint, And greeted to myself, O happy Squire! At length, tho' late, thou hast found out a saint, Who, but for Colin, feels no warm desire. Perdie, quoth Satyrane, I her admire; No lozel lose shall here discover'd be. The other answer'd with his cheeks on fire, Now by my hallidom you soon shall see That words may with the heart full often ill agree. XII I, nought accoy'd, came up unto the fair, And swore to love her all my length of life; Then offer'd her to gorgeous domes to bear, Where haidegives are daunc'd to harp and fife. She soon forgot she was another's wife, And granted with me to desert the plain. Are such ensamples emong women rife? If so, my Columbel I ne'er shall gain, But hunt around the world, and find my labours vain. XIII My lips I 'gan to royne in fell despite, And forth I rushed from her false embrace, Thro' the thick wood I wander'd day and night, Ne met I living creature face to face: At length a rising city far I trace; Thither in hopes my hasty steps I bend. Perchaunce, thought I, true Virtue may embrace The courtly dome, and from the country wend. Thus, where the least expect, we often find a friend. XIV At e'en the town I reach'd, and eke a hall, Which waxen tapers made as light as day; Fair jovisaunce sat on the face of all, And to the daunce the sprightly minstrels play, Each seem'd as sportive as the wanton jay. The dame, who own'd the house, was passing old, And had, it seems, that morning dealt away To her kind grandson many bags of gold, Who took a bonnibel to haven and to hold. XV The bride was named Viola the fair, The loaded rosiere is not half so sweet. Aye, aye, quoth I, ensamples are but rare To find so many charms in one discreet; With you, fair lass, I mean not now to treat. The springal was in wholesom lustihed, And him by name of Pamphilus they greet; He was to doughty chevisance ybred, Yet oft in courtly halls the active measure led. XVI The auncient dame they do Avara call, And much she hobbled as she trod the ground; Yet many angels in her crumenal, If fair report speaks true, were always found. Where riches flow there virtues too abound. Her pannikel was as a badger grey, And, as she walk'd the company around, It nodded with such force, that, by my fay, I thought it meant to fly from her old crag away. XVII The lofty roof was fretted o'er with gold, And all around, the walls depeinten were With many histories of times of old, Which brought not muchel credit to the fair. There Leda held her swan, with shoulders bare, And here the dame of Ephesus was found, Lick other dames, whom my kind tongue shall spare, And here stood Helen for her charms renown'd, Who soon her lord forsook, when she a leman found. XVIII And many a beauteous dame and courtly knight Came there the nuptials to celebrate: Some vers'd to wing from bow the nimble flight, Some the near foe with brondir'n to amate; Me too they welcome to the hall of state; With bel acoil they wished me to take A round or two, and chuse me out a mate: But my fond love which nothing could aslake, Caus'd me to slight them all, for Columbella's sake. XIX And now to artful steps the floor rebounds, In graceful ease the shining beavys move, The noice like thunder at a distance sounds, Mean time I sat beneath a proud alcove, And told Avara gentle tales of love. Thought I, in eld the passions are more tame, And here by craft I may successful prove; For she perforce must now be void of blame As wise Ulysses' wife, Penelopé by name. XX Ne wants she gelt, which oft the mind misleads To actions which it otherwise would shun. The courtier lythe, if right report areeds, Will unawhap'd to seize his vantage run; And so will most men underneath the sun, Or be they patriot call'd, or bard, or knight; But when they once the gilded prize have won, They seek to clear their name, with shame bedight: Befits to scour the steel, when rust offends the sight. XXI At ev'ry word I said she look'd askaunce, Then said, in unsoot whispers, Fye! Sir, fye! And turn'd as tho' she seem'd to mind the daunce, Nathless on me she cast a languid eye: Blist by thy form, my liefest life, quoth I, Cast your belgards upon an humble slave; From love, alass! in vain my heart would fly; Then with a word thy quailing leman save, For if you frown, perdie, you doom me to the grave. XXII It hap'd by chaunce she saw a golden heart With flaming diamonds around beset; This, the whole guerdon of my tedious smart, I, on a time, from Columbel did get. As simple birds are caught in fowler's net, And 'cause they see no danger none they fear, Ev'n so Avara her eyen here did set, And turned round and whisper'd in mine ear, Give me that di'mond heart, and be mine leman dear. XXIII I started from the couch where I was pight, And thus I her bespake with muchel rage, Avaunt, thou faytor false, thou imp of night! I hate myself, that I should thus engage, On any terms, to treat with wrizled age. So, forth I flung, and left the frowy witch To share her bed with coachman, groom or page; The castle too I quit, mine ire was sich, And out I set again, tho' night was dark as pitch. XXIV But did I here relate, Sir Satyrane, The many weary miles I've travelled, What dangers I've assoil'd, yet all in vain, (For, by my truth, but ill my days I've sped) Your hair would stand upright upon your head. Three hundred virtuous females side by side, By me to Columbella must be led: Can you direct me where for such to ride? I cannot, in good sooth, the courteous knight reply'd. XXV The Squire pursu'd his tale; 'Tis now three years Since curst Avara's visage first I saw; Convents I've try'd, but there the luscious freers The fair-fac'd nuns to fornication draw; Nor palaces are free from Cupid's law; His darts are fiercer than the levin-brond; Few, very few, there 'scape his mighty paw, And those in golden palls, who proudly stond, Had lever kiss their love's, than Keysar's royal hond. XXVI Fair Jenny of the mill I strove to win, And her benempt Pastora of the dale; But they bilive agreed with me to sin; One ask'd an owch, and one a watchet veil. Some wish o'er ev'ry female to prevail; My hope, my conquest is to be deny'd. The stage I've try'd, but there my projects fail; For there is scarce a single wedded bride But doth her husband's noul with horns of ront provide. XXVII As couthful fishers at the benty brook, By various arts assot the seely fry, Now wriggling worms, now paste conceals the hook, And now they hide it with a colour'd fly; This takes the perch, and that the tench's eye; So diff'rent nymphs a diff'rent charm invites, Some yield for vantage, some for vanity, A song this one, a daunce that maid delights: Man throws the wimble bait, and greedy woman bites. XXVIII With sorrow overhent, the other day I laid my weary limbs adown to rest, Where a tall beech o'erspread the dusky way; My noyous thoughts a dream awhile suppress'd, Oft weighty truths are in this garb ydress'd. Grant that it so may happy unto me; Then joyous once again shall sooth this breast, My pining soul shall be from anguish free, And I shall taste true bliss, dear Columbel, with thee. XXIX Methought I saw a figure fair and tall, And gentle smiles sat dimpling on her face, Yet seemed of a beauty nought at all, 'Till much beholding did improve each grace; At length she seem'd too fair for human race. Her kirtle white might vie with winter snows, Ne could you ought of her fair bosom trace, Nought but her face would she to sight expose, No modest maiden wends, the frannion muchel shows. XXX With visage bland, methought she hail'd me oft; “Ne fear, quoth she, a female's mild request. “The bark by tempests that is whirl'd aloft, “At length, the tempest o'er, enjoyeth rest. “My name is Chastity, tho' out of quest “With modern dames, yet thou shalt still survey “A clime where beauty is with virtue blest. “Good fortune speed you on your happy way; “Go, gentle Squire of Dames, and here no longer stay. XXXI “To Fairy lond your instant journey bend, “There Columbel may find her will obey'd; “There Chastity may boast of many a friend, “She visits there each rosy-featur'd maid. “Go on, nor be by former toils affray'd: “Go where yon oaks display their verdant pride, “'Till, from the mountains torn and stripp'd of shade, “On Neptune's billows they triumphant ride, “Protect their happy lond, and conquer all beside. XXXII “Hail happy lond! for arms and arts renown'd, “For blooming virgins free from loose desire; “A Drake, a Bacon, there a birth-place found, “And chaste Eliza time shall e'er admire: “The hero wields the sword and poet's lyre: “This Sidney knew, who still with lustre shines, “For whom Dan Spenser wak'd the warbling quire, “And many more whose names might grace his lines; “There round the warriour's palm the lover's myrtle twines.” XXXIII At this I woke, and now resolve to brave The utmost perils for my Columbel; For, know, I mean to cross the briny wave, Where Albion's chalky cliffs the sea repel: And, if no mage have laid a magick spell, Perchaunce my lot may be at length to find Three hundred nymphs, who wicked love can quell; If not, I must desert all womankind, And, what me most amates, leave Columbel behind. XXXIV The Squire of Dames surceased here his say, And forth he yode to seek the British isle, Sir Satyrane prick'd on his dapple-grey, Ne ought foreswonk he travell'd many a mile To spend his days in hardiment and toil: But first in courteous guise they bid farewell, As well befits men bred in courtly soil. Now how the Squire has sped, or ill, or well, A future canto may, perhaps, at leisure tell. XXXV For see, how Phœbus welketh in the west, My oxen from their yoke I must untye, The collar much has chauf'd their tender chest, Who labours much the sweets of rest should try. To their warm nests the daws and ravens fly Deep in the ruin'd dome or dusky wood; And beasts and birds fast lock'd in slumber lye, Save the fell bat, that flutters out for food, And the soothsaying owl, with her unlovely brood. CANTO II. ARGUMENT. The Squire he lights on Bon-vivant, Who wons in Fairy soil, Then views in Merlin's magick glass A sight that ends his toil. I To gain the point to which our soul aspires We nourish toil, and reek hard labour sweet; For this, thro' Greenland's frosts, or India's fires, The hardy sailors death and dangers meet; And the prow chieftain, bolder than discreet, In blood imbru'd pursues the martial fray, And lovers eke thro' life's loud tempests beat, Led on by hope, that never-dying ray; Hope wantons in their breast, and strews with flow'rs the way. II And sure of all mankind the Squire of Dames Shall stand the first ensample of true love, Who aye, untouch'd by any foreign flames, Preserv'd his passion for his gentle dove; Blush, modern youths, whose pulses quickly move, Fondly you glote upon the witching fair; Yet, when a sweet enjoyment once you prove, You leave the nymph intangled in the snare, Her tears flow trickling down, her singults pierce the air. III Oh think of transports which ye whilom tasted, And let the glad remembrance charm your mind, Be not the fruits of joyment quickly wasted, And to your heart her happy image bind: Think what she merits who whilear was kind, Nor by inconstancy her peace destroy; Inconstancy, that monster fell and blind: That vainly fond of ev'ry passing toy, Treads down its late delight, and poisons rapt'rous joy. IV Return we now unto our gentle youth, Whose little bark daunc'd lightly on the main, His breast divided atween joy and ruth; Now gay ideas wanton in his brain, Now woe-begon his heart is rent in twain, On his success depends his Columbel; And now he hopes, and now desponds again; The various turns of mind, when thoughts rebel, Sure pen mote ne'er describe, and none but lovers tell. V Methinks I see him on the beachy strond, Where Neptune's waves affrap the sturdy pier; His hardy steed neighs at the sight of lond, In all adventures a most faithful seer; And thro' that city he doth quickly steer, Which Ethelbert to holy Austin gave: The kings of Kent did erst inhabit here, Here haughty Becket sunk into the grave, Here thro' the smiling meads, Stoure rolls his dimpling wave. VI Long travell'd he, ne ventur'd to assay The nymphs he met, for much he was affraid To bribes or pray'rs few women would cry nay; At flatt'ry's tongue full oft will virtue fade; What shall he do? to win his lovely maid He must three hundred virtuous females find, Perdie, quoth he, my fortune be essay'd, I'll boldly try the strength of womankind: For craven heart, they say, ne'er won fair lady's mind. VII So on he prick'd, and from a rising ground Discern'd before him, in a distant vale, A castle fair: and auncient oaks around Did to the breeze their lofty heads avail; A silver stream refresh'd the fragrant dale; Their ledden loud fat oxen did repeat, And nibbling sheep display'd their fleeces pale, The woodbine shed an odor matchless sweet, And to their patient dams the frisking lambkins bleat. VIII To that same castle our advent'rer yode, The merry birds him welcom'd on the way, An hundred flow'rs aumail'd the winding road, And all was bright, and all was passing gay, You would have sworn it was the month of May. Withouten drad he thunders at the gate, Who wons within, or giant, knight or fay, Shall ne'er, in sooth, our imp of fame amate: Unto the summons loud the portal opens streit. IX And forth there issued the seneschal, Of middle age he was, if right I ween, He was in personage both plump and tall, Ne seemed he to taste of dol'rous teen, Ne wrinkle deep was on his forehead seen, But jovisaunce sat basking on his brow, At every word he spoke, he smil'd at-ween, His temples were ycrown'd with myrtle bough, And virelays he song with matchless grace, I vow. X “Whoe'er thou art, thrice welcome to these plains, “Where bitter dole ne'er shows her hateful head, “Good-fellowship wons here, and free from pains “Both youth and eld the paths of pleasure tread; “Catch flying bliss, ne be by ought foresaid; “Think that this life is but a little span; “Then laugh, and sport, and shun all dreryhed, “Thy rolling days in present pleasures plan, “Come, spend thy hours in joy, thou son of mortal man. XI “Know'st thou my name! I am l'Allegro hight, “Let me conduct thee to our jovial hall, “Where Bon-vivant in revels spends the night, “Who bids a hearty welcome unto all, “Or wear he red cross-stoles, or paynim pall.” With that he lad him with a courtly air Into a chamber deck'd for feast and ball; And tho' no tedes or tapers glimmer'd there, Yet all within was bright, as all without was fair. XII As at the close of an hot summer's day, When Phœbus in the west deserts the sky, Bright streams of light along the æther play, And tho' his fi'ry orb forsake our eye, The beamy gushes gild each object nigh; The painted meads are ting'd with golden light, And rivers roll their glitt'ring waters by; So in this house of joy with ease you might Perceive celestial rays, that cherish'd human fight. XIII The Squire of Dames his jolly host salew'd, And Bon-vivant his hond in friendship press'd; “Come, sit thee down, and taste our choicest food; “We entertake, quoth he, no vulgar guest. “Enur'd to toil, come taste the sweets of rest, “Doff thy hard arms, this samite garment wear, “This better far than mail shall bind thy breast, “This coronal shall deck thy auburn hair; “Push the brisk goblet round, and drown intruding care. XIV “For us the lark attunes his morning song, “For us the spring depeints her ev'ry flow'r, “To sooth our sleep yon fountain purls along, “And oaks to shade us, twine into a bow'r, “The pensive bard sits many a watchful hour, “In ditty sweet, to carol forth our praise: “While valour spends his days in dole and stour, “We, wiser we, undying trophies raise “To ever-blooming bliss, ne reek what wisdom says. XV “With sprightly notes we make the welkin ring, “In mazy daunce we tread the chequer'd ground, “To yielding nymphs transported shepherds sing, “Ne hard misfare emongst our train is found. “The simple swain, who looks with cark astoun'd “Because his leman ill rewards his care, “Oh, let him stond to all a lout renown'd, “Ne gibing scorn her twitting bords forbear; “Are there not other nymphs less coy, and full as fair?” XVI At this the Squire wex'd pale, “Ne eath it is, “Most courteous knight, he cry'd, far to remove “The thoughts of her in whom we place all bliss.” Quoth Bon-vivant, “What, then thou art in love?” “That I am so these many singults prove,” Return'd the Squire. L'Allegro then reply'd, “Thou'dst better wend to yonder willow grove, “Where shoals of lovers hanging side by side, “Feed the vile carrion crows, and highten female pride.” XVII With that he brast into a scornful laugh, And much abash'd appear'd our constant Squire; The others sportful the brisk vintage quaff. While thus the springal. “Yes, I do aspire “To love the fairest of the female quire. “Three hundred virtuous damsels in this isle “I came to find.” “Perdie, your odd desire, “Quoth Bon-vivant, will ask thee muchel toil; “And thou shalt travel too full many a weary mile. XVIII “'Tis not enough the conduct of the fair “Is form'd by frowning virtue's strictest leer: “The blatant-beast does here in pieces tear “The fame of those ybred in school severe; “His rankling tongue throughout the rolling year “With baleful venom ev'ry thing consumes; “Where beauty's splendor gilds our northern sphere “He slyly creeps, and to destruction dooms “The honour of the spring, and wisdom's early blooms. XIX “The brindled lyon in the lonely wood “Hides his grim aspect from the sight of men; “The pardelis and libbard's spotted brood “Reside contented in sequester'd den; “Not so the blatant-beast, he lives in ken “Of the proud city or well-peopled town; “Thence with detested fury he will ren, “Ne spare the prelate's lawn, or monarch's crown: “All fares alike with him, for all he tumbleth down. XX “What then avails it to be fair or wise? “Or what avails it to be warlike knight? “Where-e'er the monster casts his fi'ry eyes, “Each grace, each virtue sickens at the sight. “Then goodly Squire, until the morning's light “Quaff the thick darkness of the night away; “And, when the morn shall rise, in arms bedight “Proceed, and luck attend you on your way; “Algates we wish in truth with us you'd ever stay.” XXI The Squire agrees, but vows, when rising morn Shall gild the glitt'rand portals of the east, Himself he will in habergeon adorn, And seek around the isle the blatant-beast: Mean while in buxom mirth they spend the feast. Ill fares the mortal man too much who knows; Oft shall he wish himself from thought releast; The fatal knowledge in his bosom glows, And mars his golden rest, and murders soft repose. XXII Sir Chaunticleer now ey'd the rising day, And call'd dame Partlet from her vetchy bed; Now wakeful Phospher spreads his gleamy ray, And the pale moon conceal'd her silver head; The cattle brouze the lawn with dew bespread, While ev'ry bird from out the buskets flies. Then to the field our lover issued; But sleep had seal'd l'Allegro's drousy eyes, And Bon-vivant also in downy slumber lies. XXIII Our Squire, withouten drad, pursu'd his way, And look'd around to spy this monster fell, And many a well conceited roundelay He sung in honour of his Columbel: Mote he, perchaunce, destroy this spawn of hell, How easy were the task to him assign'd? The lond of Fairy doth each lond excel; View there the paragons of womankind; View the bright virgins there, and leave thy heart behind. XXIV Ah! lever should'st thou try the females there Than thus unwise another course pursue; There ev'ry nymph is innocent as fair: Try what I here advance, you'll find it true. Hard is our fate while bliss in hopes we sew, Some deadly fiend to blast our joy appears; Contentment sweet, alas, is known to few. Thus for awhile the sun the welkin chears, But soon he hides his head, and melts in dropping tears. XXV Life is a scene of conteck and distress, Ne is it longer than a winter's day; And shall we make our few enjoyments less? Far from my cot, thou blatant-beast away. No husband's noul will I with horns array, Ne shall my tongue its venom'd malice wreak On tuneful bards, whom laurel crowns apay; Ne will I 'gainst the comely matron speak, Or draw one pearly drop down beauty's rosy cheek. XXVI The Squire of Dames rode on with muchel tine, And, as he cast askaunce his greedy look, He saw empight beneath an auncient pine A hoary shepherd leaning on his crook; His falling tears increas'd the swelling brook: And he did sigh as he would break his heart. “O thou deep-read in sorrow's baleful book, “The Squire exclaim'd, areed thy burning smart; “Our dolors grow more light when we the tale impart.” XXVII To whom the swain reply'd, “O gentle youth, “Yon fruitful meads my num'rous herds possess'd, “My days roll'd on unknown to pain or ruth, “And one fair daughter my old age ybless'd. “Oh, had you seen her for the wake ydress'd “With kirtle ty'd with many a colour'd string, “Thy tongue to all the world had then confess'd “That she was sheener than the pheasant's wing, “And, when she rais'd her voice, ne lark so soot could sing. XXVIII “In virtue's thews I bred the lovely maid, “And she right well the lessons did pursue; “Too wise she was to be by man betray'd; “But the curst blatant-beast her form did view, “And round our plains did spread a tale untrue, “That Rosabella, spurning marriage band, “Had felt those pangs which virgin never knew, “And that Sir Topas my poor girl trepann'd; “He, who in sable stole doth in our pulpit stand. XXIX “Nay, more, the hellish monster has invented, “How a young swain on Shannon's banks yborn “(Had not my care the deep-laid plot prevented) “Would from my arms my Rosabel have born. “Have I not cause to weep from rising morn “'Till Phœbus welketh in the western main, “To see my dearling's fame thus vildly torn? “Have I not cause to nourish endless pain?” At this he deeply sigh'd, and wept full sore again. XXX “Curst be this blatant-beast, reply'd the Squire, “That thus infects your sea-begirted isle; “Shew me his face, that I may wreak mine ire “Upon this imp of hell, this monster vile.” “Away from hence not passing sure a mile, “Might I advise you, you had better wend,” Return'd the swain, “Deep-read in magick-style “There Merlin wons, sue him to be your friend; “And lest you miss your way, myself will you attend.” XXXI Together now they seek the hermitage Deep in the covert of a dusky glade, Where in his dortour wons the hoary sage. The moss-grown trees did form a gloomy shade, Their rustling leaves a solemn musick made, And fairies nightly tripp'd the aweful green, And if the tongue of fame have truth display'd, Full many a spectre was at midnight seen, Torn from his earthly grave, a horrid sight! I ween. XXXII Ne rose, ne vi'let glads the chearless bow'r, Ne fringed pink from earth's green bosom grew: But hemlock dire, and ev'ry baleful flow'r Might here be found, and knots of mystick rue. Close to the cell sprong up an auncient yew, And store of imps were on its boughs ypight, At his behests they from its branches flew, And, in a thousand various forms bedight, Frisk'd to the moon's pale wain, and revell'd all the night. XXXIII Around the cave a clustring ivy spread In wide embrace his over-twining arms, Within, the walls with characters bespread Declar'd the pow'rful force of magick charms. Here drugs were plac'd destructive of all harms, And books that deep futurity could scan: Here stood a spell that of his rage disarms The mountain lyon 'till he yields to man; With many secrets more, which scarce repeat I can. XXXIV The Squire of Dames deep enters in the cell: What will not valiant heart for beauty dare? His borrel fere here bids his friend farewell, And home he wends renewing cark and care. When, louting low with a becoming air, The youth cry'd out, “O thrice renowned mage, “Vouchsafe to cure me of my black dispair; “For thou not only art grown wise thro' age, “But art of mortal man by far the wisest sage.” XXXV Then Merlin with a look benign reply'd, (For he was bred with ev'ry courteous thew) “I know to make fair Columbel your bride “The blatant-beast you thro' the lond pursue; “The fate of empires now demands my view, “And for awhile denys my presence here; “Soon in this cell I'll thee again salew, “What most thou lik'st partake withouten fear, “Share all my cave affords, nor think I grudge my chear. XXXVI “Yet mark my counsel, open not that door, “Lest thou repent thy follies when too late, “Ten thousand pangs shall make thy heart full sore, “For horror scouls behind that heben gate, “And future ills shall thy dear peace amate; “There stands a mirror, wrought by magick leer, “In which are read the dark decrees of fate, “And whom you wish to see will streit appear, “Devoid of art's false mask, to human eye-sight clear. XXXVII “Ah how unlike the godlike man he seem'd “In this my glass the patriot I've descry'd, “By the vile rabblement a saint esteem'd? “He's oft a wretch compos'd of sloth and pride: “And Kesars too, not seldom deify'd, “With other men their vice and follies share; “And by my mirror if the nymph be try'd, “It will without reserve the truth declare, “Ne flatter head that's crown'd, ne flatter face that's fair. XXXVIII “Once more let me advise thee, gentle Squire, “Forbear to look at this same magick glass; “Do not too rashly into fate enquire— “But I to foreign stronds awhile must pass.” Th'unweeting youth cry'd to himself, “Alas! “Would I could know the lot to me assign'd.” “Patience, quoth Merlin, doth all things surpass.” Then to his car were winged dragons join'd, With which he sails thro' air, and far outstrips the wind. XXXIX And now the Squire surveys the lonesome cave, His wav'ring mind is in a whirlwind tost, And now the mirror he resolves to brave, And now he finds his boasted courage lost. At length determin'd whatsoe'er it cost, To see the glass, he darts into the cell; And, lest his eyes by vild retrait be crost, Thrice he invokes his lovely Columbel. As Adam fell of yore, the Squire of Dames yfell. XL The heben doors full widely he display'd, And saw the lovely queen of all his heart, Fair as the lilly in the watry glade, Bright as the morn, and bright withouten art, Thro' ev'ry vein he feels a thrillant smart: For the dear maid lay on her bed undress'd, And, may I unreprov'd the truth impart, She hugg'd a lusty stripling to her breast, Whom she full closely clipp'd, and wantonly caress'd. XLI “O faytor false, O wicked imp of night! Exclaim'd the Squire astound, “ah! wealaway! “Let Erebus in pitchy stole bedight “With foulest sprites the sons of men affray, “And blot for ever the fair face of day. “Ye haggard sisters, sound my passing-bell; “Oh! ne'er believe, ye youths, what women say. “O losel loose, O impious Columbel!” Then like a stean to earth full heavily he fell. XLII There shall we leave him, for my leaky boat Lets in the water, and I must recure Her much-worn hulk, that scarcely now can float, And moor'd in harbour she shall ride secure; Then if I can a pilot wise procure, Mayhap I may again hoist forth my sail, And other hardy voyages endure Thro' shelves and shallows: now the adverse gale Gives me some time to rest, and lond with joy I hail. On the Death of a Lady's Owl. By the Same. The Owl expires! death gave the dreadful word, And lovely Anna weeps her fav'rite bird. Ye feather'd choir in willing throngs repair, And sooth the sorrows of the melting fair; In sounds of woe the dear-departed greet, With cypress strew, ye doves, the green retreat; The fateful raven tolls the passing bell, The solemn dirge be sung by Philomel; Sir Chanticlear, a chief os hardy race, Shall guard from kites and daws the sacred place. With your just tears a bard shall mix his own, And thus, in artless verse, inscribe the stone. EPITAPH. Interr'd within this little space The bird of wisdom lies; Learn hence, how vain is ev'ry grace, How fruitless to be wise. Can mortal stop the arm of Death Who ne'er compassion knew? He Adonis. Venus' lover robb'd of breath, He, Anna's darling slew. Ah happy bird, to raise those sighs Which man could ne'er obtain! Ah happy bird, to cloud those eyes That fir'd each kneeling swain! Thrice bless'd thy life, her joy, her bliss, Thrice bless'd thy happy doom; She gave thee many a melting kiss, She wept upon thy tomb. The VANITY of Human Wishes. THE Tenth Satire of JUVENAL. IMITATED By Mr. SAMUEL JOHNSON. Let Ver. 1–12. observation with extensive view, Survey mankind, from China to Peru; Remark each anxious toil, each eager strife, And watch the busy scenes of crowded life; Then say how hope and fear, desire and hate, O'erspread with snares the clouded maze of fate, Where wav'ring man, betray'd by vent'rous pride, To tread the dreary paths without a guide; As treach'rous phantoms in the mist delude, Shuns fancied ills, or chases airy good. How rarely reason guides the stubborn choice, Rules the bold hand, or prompts the suppliant voice, How nations sink, by darling schemes oppress'd, When vengeance listens to the fool's request. Fate wings with ev'ry wish th'afflictive dart, Each gift of nature, and each grace of art, With fatal heat impetuous courage glows, With fatal sweetness elocution flows, Impeachment stops the speaker's pow'rful breath, And restless fire precipitates on death. Ver. 13–22.But scarce observ'd the knowing and the bold, Fall in the gen'ral massacre of gold; Wide-wasting pest! that rages unconfin'd, And crowds with crimes the records of mankind; For gold his sword the hireling ruffian draws, For gold the hireling judge distorts the laws; Wealth heap'd on wealth, nor truth nor safety buys, The dangers gather as the treasures rise. Let hist'ry tell where rival kings command, And dubious title shakes the madded land, When statues glean the refuse of the sword, How much more safe the vassal than the lord, Low sculks the hind beneath the rage of pow'r, And leaves the wealthy traytor in the Tow'r, Untouch'd his cottage, and his slumbers sound, Tho' confiscation's vulturs hover round. The needy traveller, serene and gay, Walks the wild heath, and sings his toil away. Does envy seize thee? crush th'upbraiding joy, Increase his riches and his peace destroy, New fears in dire vicissitude invade, The rustling brake alarms, and quiv'ring shade, Nor light nor darkness bring his pain relief, One shews the plunder, and one hides the thief. Yet Ver. 23–27. still one gen'ral cry the skies assails, And gain and grandeur load the tainted gales; Few know the toiling statesman's fear or care, Th'insidious rival and the gaping heir. Once Ver. 28–55. more, Democritus, arise on earth, With chearful wisdom and instructive mirth, See motly life in modern trappings dress'd, And feed with varied fools th'eternal jest: Thou who couldst laugh where want enchain'd caprice, Toil crush'd conceit, and man was of a piece; Where wealth unlov'd without a mourner dy'd; And scarce a sycophant was fed by pride; Where ne'er was known the form of mock debate, Or seen a new-made mayor's unwieldy state; Where change of fav'rites made no change of laws, And senates heard before thy judg'd a cause; How wouldst thou shake at Britain's modish tribe, Dart the quick taunt, and edge the piercing gibe? Attentive truth and nature to decry, And pierce each scene with philosophic eye. To thee were solemn toys or empty shew, The robes of pleasure and the veils of woe: All aid the farce, and all thy mirth maintain, Whose joys are causeless, or whose griefs are vain. Such was the scorn that fill'd the sage's mind, Renew'd at ev'ry glance on humankind; How just that scorn ere yet thy voice declare, Search every state, and canvass ev'ry prayer. Ver. 56–107.Unnumber'd suppliants crowd Preferment's gate; Athirst for wealth, and burning to be great; Delusive Fortune hears th'incessant call, They mount, they shine, evaporate, and fall. On ev'ry stage the foes of peace attend, Hate dogs their flight, and insult mocks their end. Love ends with hope, the sinking statesman's door Pours in the morning worshipper no more; For growing names the weekly scribbler lies, To growing wealth the dedicator flies, From every room descends the painted face, That hung the bright Palladium of the place, And smoak'd in kitchens, or in auctions sold, To better features yields the frame of gold; For now no more we trace in ev'ry line Heroic worth, benevolence divine: The form distorted justifies the fall, And detestation rids th'indignant wall. But will not Britain hear the last appeal, Sign her foes doom, or guard her fav'rites zeal; Tho' Freedom's sons no more remonstrance rings, Degrading nobles and controuling kings; Our supple tribes repress their patriot throats, And ask no questions but the price of votes; With weekly libels and septennial ale, Their wish is full to riot and to rail. In full-blown dignity, see Wolsey stand, Law in his voice, and fortune in his hand: To him the church, the realm, their pow'rs consign, Thro' him the rays of regal bounty shine, Still to new heights his restless wishes tow'r, Claim leads to claim, and pow'r advances pow'r; 'Till conquest unresisted ceas'd to please, And rights submitted, left him none to seize. At length his sov'reign frowns—the train of state Mark the keen glance, and watch the sign to hate. Where-e'er he turns he meets a stranger's eye, His suppliants scorn him, and his followers fly; At once is lost the pride of aweful state, The golden canopy, the glitt'ring plate, The regal palace, the luxurious board, The liv'ried army, and the menial lord. With age, with cares, with maladies oppress'd, He seeks the refuge of monastic rest. Grief aids disease, remember'd folly stings, And his last sighs reproach the faith of kings. Speak thou, whose thoughts at humble peace repine, Shall Wolsey's wealth, with Wolsey's end be thine? Or liv'st thou now, with safer pride content, The wisest justice on the banks of Trent? For why did Wolsey near the steeps of fate, On weak foundations raise th'enormous weight? Why but to sink beneath Misfortune's blow, With louder ruin to the gulphs below? What Ver. 108–113. gave great Villiers to th'assassin's knife, And fix'd disease on Harley's closing life? What murder'd Wentworth, and what exil'd Hyde, By kings protected, and to kings ally'd? What but their wish indulg'd in courts to shine, And pow'r too great to keep, or to resign? When Ver. 114–132. first the college rolls receive his name, The young enthusiast quits his ease for fame; Thro' all his veins the fever of renown Spreads from the strong contagion of the gown; O'er Bodley's dome his future labours spread, And There is a tradition, that the study of friar Bacon, built on an arch over the bridge, will fall, when a man greater than Bacon shall pass under it. Bacon's mansion trembles o'er his head. Are these thy views? proceed illustrious youth, And virtue guard thee to the throne of Truth! Yet should thy soul indulge the gen'rous heat, 'Till captive Science yields her last retreat; Should Reason guide thee with her brightest ray, And pour on misty Doubt resistless day; Should no false Kindness lure to loose delight, Nor Praise relax, nor Difficulty fright; Should tempting Novelty thy cell refrain, And Sloth effuse her opiate fumes in vain; Should Beauty blunt on fops her fatal dart, Nor claim the triumph of a letter'd heart; Should no Disease thy torpid veins invade, Nor Melancholy's phantoms haunt thy shade; Yet hope not life from grief or danger free, Nor think the doom of man revers'd for thee: Deign on the passing world to turn thine eyes, And pause awhile from letters, to be wise; There mark what ills the scholar's life assail, Toil, envy, want, the patron, and the jail. See nations slowly wise, and meanly just, To buried merit raise the tardy bust. If dreams yet flatter, once again attend, Here Lydiat's life, and Galileo's end. Nor deem, when Learning her last prize bestows, The glitt'ring eminence exempt from woes; See when the vulgar 'scape, despis'd or aw'd, Rebellion's vengeful talons seize on Laud. From meaner minds, tho' smaller fines content The plunder'd palace or sequester'd rent; Mark'd out by dangerous parts he meets the shock, And fatal Learning leads him to the block: Around his tomb let Art and Genius weep, But hear his death, ye blockheads, hear and sleep. The Ver. 133–146. festal blazes, the triumphal show, The ravish'd standard, and the captive foe, The senate's thanks, the gazette's pompous tale, With force resistless o'er the brave prevail. Such bribes the rapid Greek o'er Asia whirl'd, For such the steady Romans shook the world; For such in distant lands the Britons shine, And stain with blood the Danube or the Rhine; This pow'r has praise, that virtue scarce can warm, 'Till fame supplies the universal charm. Yet Reason frowns on War's unequal game, Where wasted nations raise a single name, And mortgag'd states their grandsires wreaths regret, From age to age in everlasting debt; Wreaths which at last the dear-bought right convey To rust on medals, or on stones decay. On Ver. 147–167. what foundation stands the warrior's pride, How just his hopes let Swedish Charles decide; A frame of adamant, a soul of fire, No dangers fright him, and no labours tire; O'er love, o'er fear extends his wide domain, Unconquer'd lord of pleasure and of pain; No joys to him pacific scepters yield, War sounds the trump, he rushes to the field; Behold surrounding kings their pow'r combine, And one capitulate, and one resign; Peace courts his hand, but spreads her charms in vain; “Think nothing gain'd, he cries, till nought remain, “On Moscow's walls till Gothic standards fly, “And all be mine beneath the polar sky.” The march begins in military state, And nations on his eye suspended wait; Stern Famine guards the solitary coast, And Winter barricades the realm of Frost; He comes, not want and cold his course delay;— Hide, blushing Glory, hide Pultowa's day: The vanquish'd hero leaves his broken bands, And shews his miseries in distant lands; Condemn'd a needy supplicant to wait, While ladies interpose, and slaves debate. But did not Chance at length her error mend? Did no subverted empire mark his end? Did rival monarchs give the fatal wound? Or hostile millions press him to the ground? His fall was destin'd to a barren strand, A petty fortress, and a dubious hand; He left the name, at which the world grew pale, To point a moral, or adorn a tale. All Ver. 168–187. times their scenes of pompous woes afford, From Persia's tyrant to Bavaria's lord. In gay hostility, and barb'rous pride, With half mankind embattled at his side, Great Xerxes comes to seize the certain prey, And starves exhausted regions in his way; Attendant Flatt'ry counts his myriads o'er, 'Till counted myriads sooth his pride no more; Fresh praise is try'd 'till madness fires his mind, The waves he lashes, and enchains the wind; New pow'rs are claim'd, new pow'rs are still bestow'd, 'Till rude resistance lops the spreading god; The daring Greeks deride the martial show, And heap their vallies with the gaudy foe; Th'insulted sea with humbler thoughts he gains, A single skiff to speed his flight remains; Th'incumber'd oar scarce leaves the dreaded coast Thro' purple billows and a floating host. The bold Bavarian, in a luckless hour, Tries the dread summits of Cesarean pow'r, With unexpected legions bursts away, And sees defenceless realms receive his sway; Short sway! fair Austria spreads her mournful charms, The queen, the beauty, sets the world in arms; From hill to hill the beacons rousing blaze Spreads wide the hope of plunder and of praise; The fierce Croatian, and the wild Hussar, And all the sons of ravage crowd the war; The baffled prince in honour's flatt'ring bloom Of hasty greatness sinds the fatal doom, His foes derision, and his subjects blame, And steals to death from anguish and from shame. Enlarge Ver. 188–288. my life with multitude of days, In health, in sickness, thus the suppliant prays; Hides from himself his state, and shuns to know, That life protracted is protracted woe. Time hovers o'er, impatient to destroy, And shuts up all the passages of joy: In vain their gifts the bounteous seasons pour, The fruit autumnal, and the vernal flow'r, With listless eyes the dotard views the store, He views, and wonders that they please no more; Now pall the tasteless meats, and joyless wines, And Luxury with sighs her slave resigns. Approach, ye minstrels, try the soothing strain, And yield the tuneful lenitives of pain: No sounds alas would touch th'impervious ear, Tho' dancing mountains witness Orpheus near, Nor lute nor lyre his feeble pow'rs attend, Nor sweeter musick of a virtuous friend, But everlasting dictates crowd his tongue, Perversely grave or positively wrong. The still returning tale, and ling'ring jest, Perplex the fawning niece and pamper'd guest, While growing hopes scarce awe the gath'ring sneer, And scarce a legacy can bribe to hear; The watchful guests still hint the last offence, The daughter's petulance, the son's expence, Improve his heady rage with treach'rous skill, And mould his passions 'till they make his will. Unnumber'd maladies his joints invade, Lay siege to life and press the dire blockade, But unextinguish'd Av'rice still remains, And dreaded losses aggravate his pains; He turns, with anxious heart and cripled hands, His bonds of debt, and mortgages of lands; Or views his coffers with suspicious eyes, Unlocks his gold, and counts it 'till he dies. But grant, the virtues of a temp'rate prime Bless with an age exempt from scorn or crime; An age that melts in unperceiv'd decay, And glides in modest innocence away; Whose peaceful day Benevolence endears, Whose night congratulating Conscience chears; The gen'ral fav'rite, as the gen'ral friend; Such age there is, and who could wish its end? Yet ev'n on this her load Misfortune flings, To press the weary minutes flagging wings: New sorrow rises as the day returns, A sister sickens, or a daughter mourns. Now kindred Merit fills the sable bier, Now lacerated friendship claims a tear. Year chases year, decay pursues decay, Still drops some joy from with'ring life away; New forms arise, and diff'rent views engage, Superfluous lags the vet'ran on the stage, 'Till pitying Nature signs the last release, And bids afflicted worth retire to peace. But few there are whom hours like these await, Who set unclouded in the gulphs of Fate. From Lydia's monarch should the search descend, By Solon caution'd to regard his end, In life's last scene what prodigies surprise, Fears of the brave, and follies of the wise? From Marlb'rough's eyes the streams of dotage flow, And Swift expires a driv'ler and a show. The Ver. 289–345. teeming mother, anxious for her race, Begs for each birth the fortune of a face: Yet Vane could tell what ills from beauty spring; And Sedley curs'd the form that pleas'd a king. Ye nymphs of rosy lips and radiant eyes, Whom Pleasure keeps too busy to be wise, Whom Joys with soft varieties invite, By day the frolick, and the dance by night, Who frown with vanity, who smile with art, And ask the latest fashion of the heart, What care, what rules your heedless charms shall save, Each nymph your rival, and each youth your slave? Against your fame with fondness hate combines, The rival batters, and the lover mines. With distant voice neglected Virtue calls, Less heard and less, the faint remonstrance falls; Tir'd with contempt, she quits the slipp'ry reign, And Pride and Prudence take her seat in vain. In crowd at once, where none the pass defend, The harmless Freedom, and the private Friend. The guardians yield, by force superior ply'd; By Int'rest, Prudence; and by Flatt'ry, Pride. Now beauty falls betray'd, despis'd, distress'd, And hissing Infamy proclaims the rest. Where Ver. 346–366. then shall Hope and Fear their objects find? Must dull Suspence corrupt the stagnant mind? Must helpless man, in ignorance sedate, Roll darkling down the torrent of his fate? Must no dislike alarm, no wishes rise, No cries attempt the mercies of the skies? Enquirer, cease, petitions yet remain, Which heav'n may hear, nor deem religion vain. Still raise for good the supplicating voice, But leave to heav'n the measure and the choice. Safe in his pow'r, whose eyes discern afar The secret ambush of a specious pray'r. Implore his aid, in his decisions rest, Secure whate'er he gives, he gives the best. Yet when the sense of sacred presence fires, And strong devotion to the skies aspires, Pour forth thy fervours for a healthful mind, Obedient passions, and a will resign'd; For love, which scarce collective man can fill; For patience sov'reign o'er transmuted ill; For faith that panting for a happier seat, Counts death kind Nature's signal of retreat: These goods for man the laws of heav'n ordain, These goods he grants, who grants the pow'r to gain; With these celestial Wisdom calms the mind, And makes the happiness she does not find. The TEARS of OLD MAY-DAY. Led by the jocund train of vernal hours And vernal airs, uprose the gentle May; Blushing she rose, and blushing rose the flow'rs That sprung spontaneous in the genial ray. Her locks with heav'n's ambrosial dews were bright, And am'rous zephyrs flutter'd on her breast: With ev'ry shifting gleam of morning light The colours shifted of her rainbow vest. Imperial ensigns grac'd her smiling form, A golden key, and golden wand she bore; This charms to peace each sullen eastern storm, And that unlocks the Summer's copious store. Onward in conscious majesty she came, The grateful honours of mankind to taste; To gather fairest wreaths of future fame, And blend fresh triumphs with her glories past. Vain hope! no more in choral bands unite Her virgin vot'ries, and at early dawn, Sacred to May and Love's mysterious rite, Brush the light dew-drops Alluding to the country custom of gathering May-dew. from the spangled lawn. To her no more Augusta's The plate garlands of London. wealthy pride Pours the full tribute from Potosi's mine; Nor fresh-blown garlands village maids provide, A purer off'ring, at her rustic shrine. No more the Maypole's verdant height around To Valour's games th'ambitious youth advance: No merry bells and tabors' sprightlier sound Wake the loud carol, and the sportive dance. Sudden in pensive sadness droop'd her head, Faint on her cheeks the blushing crimson dy'd— “O! chaste victorious triumphs, whither fled? “My maiden honours, whither gone?” she cry'd. Ah! once to fame and bright dominion born, The Earth and smiling Ocean saw me rise, With time coeval and the star of morn, The first, the fairest daughter of the skies. Then, when at heav'n's prolific mandate sprung The radiant beam of new-created day, Celestial harps, to airs of triumph strung, Hail'd the glad dawn, and angels call'd me MAY. Space in her empty regions heard the sound, And hills, and dales, and rocks, and vallies rung; The sun exulted in his glorious round, And shouting planets in their courses sung. For ever then I led the constant year; Saw Youth, and Joy, and Love's enchanting wiles; Saw the mild Graces in my train appear, And infant Beauty brighten in my smiles. No Winter frown'd. In sweet embrace ally'd, Three sister Seasons danc'd th'eternal green; And Spring's retiring softness gently vy'd With Autumn's blush, and Summer's lofty mien. Too soon, when man prophan'd the blessings giv'n, And Vengeance arm'd to blot a guilty age, With bright Astrea to my native heav'n I fled, and flying saw the Deluge rage: Saw bursting clouds eclipse the noontide beams, While sounding billows from the mountains roll'd, With bitter waves polluting all my streams, My nectar'd streams, that flow'd on sands of gold. Then vanquish'd many a sea-girt isle and grove, Their forests floating on the wat'ry plain: Then, fam'd for arts and laws deriv'd from Jove, My Atalantis See Plato. sunk beneath the main. No longer bloom'd primeval Eden's bow'rs, Nor guardian dragons watch'd the Hesperian steep: With all their fountains, fragrant fruits and flow'rs, Torn from the continent to glut the deep. No more to dwell in sylvan scenes I deign'd, Yet oft descending to the languid earth, With quick'ning pow'rs the fainting mass sustain'd, And wak'd her slumb'ring atoms into birth. And ev'ry echo caught my raptur'd name, And ev'ry virgin breath'd her am'rous vows, And precious wreaths of rich immortal fame, Show'r'd by the Muses, crown'd my lofty brows. But chief in Europe, and in Europe's pride, My Albion's favour'd realms, I rose ador'd; And pour'd my wealth to other climes deny'd, From Amalthea's horn with plenty stor'd. Ah me! for now a younger rival claims My ravish'd honours, and to her belong My choral dances, and victorious games, To her my garlands and triumphal song. O say what yet untasted bounties flow, What purer joys await her gentler reign? Do lillies fairer, vi'lets sweeter blow? And warbles Philomel a softer strain? Do morning suns in ruddier glory rise? Does ev'ning fan her with serener gales? Do clouds drop fatness from the wealthier skies? Or wantons Plenty in her happier vales? Ah! no: the blunted beams of dawning light Skirt the pale orient with uncertain day; And Cynthia, riding on the car of night, Thro' clouds embattled faintly wins her way. Pale, immature, the blighted verdure springs, Nor mounting juices feed the swelling flow'r; Mute all the groves, nor Philomela sings When Silence listens at the midnight hour. Nor wonder, man, that Nature's bashful face, And op'ning charms her rude embraces fear: Is she not sprung of April's wayward race, The sickly daughter of th'unripen'd year? With show'rs and sunshine in her fickle eyes, With hollow smiles proclaiming treach'rous peace; With blushes, harb'ring in their thin disguise The blast that riots on the Spring's increase. Is this the fair invested with my spoil By Europe's laws, and Senates' stern command? Ungen'rous Europe, let me fly thy soil, And waft my treasures to a grateful land: Again revive on Asia's drooping shore My Daphne's groves, or Lycia's ancient plain: Again to Afric's sultry sands restore Embow'ring shades, and Lybian Ammon's fane: Or haste to northern Zembla's savage coast, There hush to silence elemental strife; Brood o'er the region of eternal Frost, And swell her barren womb with heat and life. Then Britain—here she ceas'd. Indignant grief, And parting pangs her fault'ring tongue supprest: Veil'd in an amber cloud, she sought relief, And tears, and silent anguish told the rest. SONG for RANELAGH. By Mr. W. Whitehead. I Ye belles, and ye flirts, and ye pert little things, Who trip in this frolicksome round, Pray tell me from whence this indecency springs, The sexes at once to confound: What means the cock'd hat, and the masculine air, With each motion design'd to perplex? Bright eyes were intended to languish, not stare, And softness the test of your sex. II The girl who on beauty depends for support, May call ev'ry art to her aid: The bosom display'd, and the petticoat short, Are samples she gives of her trade. But you, on whom Fortune indulgently smiles, And whom Pride has preserv'd from the snare; Should slily attack us, with coyness and wiles, Not with open and insolent air. III The Venus whose statue delights all mankind Shrinks modestly back from the view, And kindly shou'd seem by the artist design'd To serve as a model for you. Then learn with her beauties to copy her air, Nor venture too much to reveal; Our fancies will paint what you cover with care, And double each charm you conceal. IV The blushes of Morn, and the mildness of May, Are charms which no art can procure; Oh! be but yourselves, and our homage we pay, And your empire is solid and sure. But if Amazon like you attack your gallants, And put us in fear of our lives, You may do very well for sisters and aunts, But believe me you'll never be wives. The Benedicite Paraphrased. By the Rev. Mr. Merrick. I Ye works of God, on him alone, In earth his footstool, heaven his throne, Be all your praise bestow'd; Whose hand the beauteous fabrick made, Whose eye the finish'd work survey'd, And saw that all was good. II Ye angels, that with loud acclaim Admiring view'd the new-born frame, And hail'd th'eternal King; Again proclaim your Maker's praise, Again your thankful voices raise, And touch the tuneful string. III Praise him, ye bless'd ætherial plains, Where, in full majesty, he deigns To fix his aweful throne: Ye waters, that above him roll, From orb to orb, from pole to pole, Oh! make his praises known! IV Ye thrones, dominions, virtues, pow'rs, Join ye your joyful songs with ours, With us your voices raise; From age to age extend the lay, To heav'n's eternal Monarch pay Hymns of eternal praise. V Cœlestial orb!—whose pow'rful ray Opes the glad eyelids of the day, Whose influence all things own; Praise him, whose courts effulgent shine With light, as far excelling thine, As thine the paler moon. VI Ye glitt'ring planets of the sky, Whose lamps the absent sun supply, With him the song pursue; And let himself submissive own, He borrows from a brighter Sun, The light he lends to you. VII Ye show'rs, and dews, whose moisture shed, Calls into life the op'ning seed, To him your praises yield; Whose influence wakes the genial birth, Drops fatness on the pregnant earth, And crowns the laughing field. VIII Ye winds that oft tempestuous sweep The ruffled surface of the deep, With us confess your God; See, thro' the heav'ns, the King of kings, Up-borne on your expanded wings, Come flying all abroad. IX Ye floods of fire, where-e'er ye flow, With just submission humbly bow To his superior pow'r; Who stops the tempest on its way, Or bids the flaming deluge stray, And gives it strength to roar. X Ye summer's heat, and winter's cold, By turns in long succession roll'd, The drooping world to chear; Praise him, who gave the sun and moon, To lead the various seasons on, And guide the circling year. XI Ye frosts, that bind the wat'ry plain, Ye silent show'rs of fleecy rain, Pursue the heav'nly theme: Praise him who sheds the driving snow, Forbids the harden'd waves to flow, And stops the rapid stream. XII Ye days and nights, that swiftly born, From morn to eve, from eve to morn, Alternate glide away; Praise him, whose never-varying light, Absent, adds horror to the night, But present gives the day. XIII Light,—from whose rays all beauty springs, Darkness,—whose wide-expanded wings Involve the dusky globe: Praise him, who, when the heav'ns he spread, Darkness his thick pavilion made, And light his regal robe. XIV Praise him, ye light'nings, as ye fly, Wing'd with his vengeance thro' the sky, And red with wrath divine; Praise him, ye clouds, that wand'ring stray, Or fix'd by him in close array, Surround his aweful shrine. XV Exalt, O earth! thy heav'nly King, Who bids the plants, that form the spring, With annual verdure bloom; Whose frequent drops of kindly rain, Prolific swell the rip'ning grain, And bless thy fertile womb. XVI Ye mountains, that ambitious rise, And heave your summits to the skies, Revere his aweful nod; Think how you once affrighted fled, When Jordan sought his fountain-head, And own'd th'approaching God. XVII Ye trees, that fill the rural scene, Ye flowers, that o'er th'enamel'd green In native beauty reign, O! praise the Ruler of the skies, Whose hand the genial sap supplies, And clothes the smiling plain. XVIII Ye secret springs, ye gentle rills, That murm'ring rise among the hills, Or fill the humble vale; Praise him, at whose almighty nod The rugged rock dissolving flow'd, And form'd a springing well. XIX Praise him, ye floods, and seas profound, Whose waves the spacious earth surround, And roll from shore to shore; Aw'd by his voice, ye seas, subside, Ye floods, within your channels glide, And tremble and adore. XX Ye whales, that stir the boiling deep, Or in its dark recesses sleep, Remote from human eye; Praise him, by whom ye all are fed, Praise him, without whose heavenly aid Ye languish, faint, and die. XXI Ye birds, exalt your Maker's name, Begin, and with th'important theme Your artless lays improve; Wake with your songs the rising day, Let musick sound on ev'ry spray, And fill the vocal grove. XXII Praise him, ye beasts, that nightly roam Amid the solitary gloom, Th'expected prey to seize; Ye slaves of the laborious plough, Your stubborn necks submissive bow, And bend your weary'd knees. XXIII Ye sons of men, his praise display, Who stampt his image on your clay, And gave it pow'r to move; Yet that in Judah's confines dwell, From age to age successive tell The wonders of his love. XXIV Let Levi's tribe the lay prolong, 'Till angels listen to the song, And bend attentive down; Let wonder seize the heav'nly train, Pleas'd, while they hear a mortal strain, So sweet, so like their own. XXV And you, your thankful voices join, That oft at Salem's sacred shrine Before his altars kneel; Where thron'd in majesty he dwells, And from the mystick cloud reveals The dictates of his will. XXVI Ye spirits of the just and good, That, eager for the blest abode, To heav'nly mansions soar; O! let your songs his praise display, 'Till heav'n itself shall melt away, And time shall be no more. XXVII Praise him, ye meek and humble train, Ye saints, whom his decrees ordain The boundless bliss to share; O! praise him, 'till ye take your way To regions of eternal day, And reign for ever there. XXVIII Let us, what now impassive stand, Aw'd by the tyrant's stern command, Amid the fiery blaze; While thus we triumph in the flame, Rise, and our Maker's love proclaim, In hymns of endless praise. An ODE to FANCY. By the Same. Fancy, whose delusions vain Sport themselves with human brain; Rival thou of Nature's pow'r, Can'st, from thy exhaustless store, Bid a tide of sorrow flow, And whelm the soul in deepest woe: Or in the twinkling of an eye, Raise it to mirth and jollity. Dreams and shadows by thee stand, Taught to run at thy command, And along the wanton air, Flit like empty Gossimer. Thee, black Melancholy of yore To the swift-wing'd Hermes bore: From the mixture of thy line, Different natures in thee join, Which thou chusest to express By the variance of thy dress. Now like thy sire thou lov'st to seem Light and gay with pinions trim, Dipt in all the dyes that glow In the bend of Iris' bow: Now like thy mother drear and sad, (All in mournful vestments clad, Cypress weeds and sable stole,) Thou rushest on th'affrighted soul. Oft I feel thee coming on, When the night hath reach'd her noon, And darkness, partner of her reign, Round the world hath bound her chain, Then with measur'd step and slow, In the church-yard path I go, And while my outward senses sleep, Lost in contemplation deep, Sudden I stop, and turn my ear, And list'ning hear, or think I hear. First a dead and sullen sound Walks along the holy ground; Then thro' the gloom alternate break Groans, and the shrill screech-owl's shriek. Lo! the moon hath hid her head, And the graves give up their dead: By me pass the ghastly crowds, Wrapt in visionary shrouds; Maids, who died with love forlorn, Youths, who fell by maidens' scorn, Helpless sires and matrons old Slain for sordid thirst of gold, And babes who owe their shorten'd date To cruel step-dames ruthless hate; Each their sev'ral errands go, To haunt the wretch that wrought their woe: From their sight the caitiff flies, And his heart within him dies; While a horror damp and chill Thro' his frozen blood doth thrill, And his hair for very dread Bears itself upon his head. When the early breath of day Hath made the shadows flee away; Still possess'd by thee I rove Bosom'd in the shelt'ring grove, There, with heart and lyre new strung, Meditate the lofty song. And if thou my voice inspire, And with wonted frenzy fire, Aided by thee I build the rhyme Such, as nor the flight of time, Nor wasting flame, nor eating show'r, Nor lightning's blast can e'er devour. Or if chance some moral page My attentive thoughts engage, On I walk, with silent tread, Under the thick-woven shade, While the thrush, unheeded by, Tunes her artless minstrelsy. List'ning to their sacred lore, I think on ages long past o'er, When Truth and Virtue hand in hand Walk'd upon the smiling land. Thence my eyes on Britain glance, And, awaken'd from my trance, While my busy thoughts I rear, Oft I wipe the falling tear. When the night again descends And her shadowy cone extends, O'er the fields I walk alone, By the silence of the moon. Hark! upon my left I hear Wild musick wand'ring in the air; Led by the sound I onward creep, And thro' the neighb'ring hedge I peep; There I spy the Fairy band Dancing on the level land, Now with step alternate bound, Join'd in one continu'd round, Now their plighted hands unbind, And such tangled mazes wind As the quick eye can scarce pursue, And wou'd have puzzled that fam'd clue, Which led th'Athenian's unskill'd feet Thro' the Labyrinth of Crete. At the near approach of day, Sudden the musick dies away, Wasting in the sea of air, And the phantoms disappear, All (as the glow-worm waxes dim) Vanish like a morning dream, And of their revels leave no trace, Save the ring upon the grass. When the elphin show is fled, Home I haste me to my bed; There if thou with magick wand On my temples take thy stand, I see in mix'd disorder rise All that struck my waking eyes: So when I stand, and round me gaze, Where the fam'd Lodona strays; On the woods and thickets brown, That its sedgy margin crown, And watch the vagrant clouds that fly Thro' the vast desart of the sky, When adown I cast my look On the smooth unruffled brook, (While its current clear doth run, And holds its mirrour to the sun,) There I see th'inverted scene Fall, and meet the eye again. The MONKIES, a TALE. By the Same. Whoe'er with curious eye has rang'd Thro' Ovid's tales, has seen How Jove, incens'd, to monkies chang'd A tribe of worthless men. Repentant soon th'offending race Intreat the injur'd pow'r, To give them back the human face, And reason's aid restore. Jove, sooth'd at length, his ear inclin'd, And granted half their pray'r; But t'other half he bade the wind Disperse in empty air. Scarce had the thund'rer giv'n the nod That shook the vaulted skies, With haughtier air the creatures strode, And stretch'd their dwindled size. The hair in curls luxuriant now Around their temples spread; The tail that whilom hung below, Now dangled from the head. The head remains unchang'd within, Nor alter'd much the face; It still retains its native grin, And all its old grimace. Thus half transform'd and half the same, Jove bade them take their place, (Restoring them their ancient claim) Among the human race. Man with contempt the brute survey'd, Nor would a name bestow; But woman lik'd the motley breed, And call'd the thing a Beau. An Epitaph. Thus Translated. By the Same. Thee, Pæta, death's relentless hand Cut off in earliest bloom, Oh! had the fates for me ordain'd To share an equal doom; With joy this busy world I'd leave, This hated light resign, To lay me in the peaceful grave, And be for ever thine: Do thou, if Lethe court thy lip, To taste its stream forbear: Still in thy soul his image keep, Who hastes to meet thee there. Safe o'er the dark and dreary shore, In quest of thee I'll roam, Love with his lamp shall run before, And break the circling gloom. VERSES sent to Dean Swift on his Birth-day, with Pine's Horace finely bound. Written by Dr. J. Sican. [Horace speaking.] You've read, Sir, in poetic strain, How Varus and the Mantuan swain Have on my birth-day been invited (But I was forc'd in verse to write it) Upon a plain repast to dine, And taste my old Campanian wine; But I, who all punctilio's hate, Tho' long familiar with the great, Nor glory in my reputation, Am come without an invitation, And tho' I'm us'd to right Falernian, I'll deign for once to taste Iernian; But fearing that you might dispute (Had I put on a common suit,) My breeding and my politesse, I visit in a birth-day dress; My coat of purest Turkey-red, With gold embroid'ry richly spread; To which, I've sure as good pretensions, As Irish lords who starve on pensions. What tho' proud ministers of state Did at your antichamber wait; What tho' your Oxfords, and your St. Johns, Have at your Levee paid attendance; And Peterborough and great Ormond, With many chiefs who now are dormant, Have laid aside the general's staff And public cares, with you to laugh; Yet I some friends as good can name, Nor less the darling sons of fame; For sure my Pollio and Mecænas Were as good statesman, Mr. Dean, as Either your Bolingbroke or Harley, Tho' they made Lewis beg a parley: And as for Mordaunt your lov'd hero, I'll match him with my Drusus Nero. You'll boast perhaps your fav'rite Pope, But Virgil is as good I hope. I own indeed I can't get any To equal Helsham and Delany; Since, Athens brought forth Socrates, A Grecian Isle Hippocrates; Since, Tully liv'd before my time, And Galen bless'd another clime. You'll plead perhaps to my request, To be admitted as a guest, Your hearing's bad—but why such fears? I speak to eyes, and not to ears; And for that reason, wisely took The form you see me in, a book. Attack'd, by slow-devouring moths, By rage of barb'rous Huns and Goths: By Bentley's notes, my deadliest foes, By Creech's rhimes and Dunster's prose; I found my boasted wit and fire In their rude hands almost expire: Yet still they but in vain assail'd, For had their violence prevail'd, And in a blast destroy'd my fame, They wou'd have partly miss'd their aim; Since all my spirit in thy page Defies the Vandals of this age. 'Tis yours to save these small remains From future pedants muddy brains, And fix my long-uncertain fate, You best know how,—which way?—translate. VERSES written in a GARDEN. By Lady M. W. M. See how that pair of billing doves With open murmurs own their loves; And heedless of censorious eyes, Pursue their unpolluted joys: No fears of future want molest The downy quiet of their nest; No int'rest join'd the happy pair, Securely blest in Nature's care, While her dear dictates they pursue: For constancy is nature too. Can all the doctrine of our schools, Our maxims, our religious rules, Can learning to our lives ensure Virtue so bright, or bliss so pure? The great Creator's happy ends, Virtue and pleasure ever blends: In vain the church and court have try'd Th'united essence to divide; Alike they find their wild mistake, The pedant priest, and giddy rake. AN ANSWER to a LOVE-LETTER. By the Same. Is it to me, this sad lamenting strain: Are heaven's choicest gifts bestow'd in vain? A plenteous fortune, and a beauteous bride, Your love rewarded, gratify'd your pride: Yet leaving her—'tis me that you pursue Without one single charm, but being new. How vile is man! how I detest their ways Of artful falshood, and designing praise! Tasteless, an easy happiness you slight, Ruin your joy, and mischief your delight. Why should poor pug (the mimic of your kind) Wear a rough chain, and be to box confin'd? Some cup, perhaps, he breaks, or tears a fan,— While roves unpunish'd the destroyer, man. Not bound by vows, and unrestrain'd by shame, In sport you break the heart, and rend the fame. Nor that your art can be successful here, Th'already plunder'd need no robber fear: Nor sighs, nor charms, nor flatteries can move, Too well secur'd against a second love. Once, and but once, that devil charm'd my mind; To reason deaf, to observation blind; I idly hop'd (what cannot love persuade!) My fondness equal'd, and my love repay'd; Slow to distrust, and willing to believe, Long hush'd my doubts, and did myself deceive: But oh! too soon—this tale would ever last; Sleep, sleep, my wrongs, and let me think 'em past. For you, who mourn with counterfeited grief, And ask so boldly like a begging thief, May soon some other nymph inflict the pain, You know so well with cruel art to feign. Tho' long you sported have with Cupid's dart, You may see eyes, and you may feel a heart. So the brisk wits, who stop the evening coach, Laugh at the fear that follows their approach; With idle mirth, and haughty scorn despise The passenger's pale cheek, and staring eyes: But seiz'd by Justice, find a fright no jest, And all the terror doubled in their breast. In Answer to a LADY who advised RETIREMENT. By the Same. You little know the heart that you advise; I view this various scene with equal eyes: In crowded courts I find myself alone, And pay my worship to a nobler throne. Long since the value of this world I know, Pity the madness, and despise the show. Well as I can my tedious part I bear, And wait for my dismission without fear. Seldom I mark mankind's detested ways, Not hearing censure, nor affecting praise; And, unconcern'd, my future state I trust To that sole Being, merciful and just. An Address of the Statues at Stowe, to Lord Cobham, on his Return to his Gardens. From every Muse and every art thy own, Thy bow'rs our theatres, thy mind our throne! Hail! to thy virtues manumiz'd from state; Hail! to thy leisure to be wisely great. Fetter'd by duties and to forms enslav'd, How timely have thy years a remnant sav'd! To taste that freedom which thy sword maintain'd, And lead in letter'd ease, a life unpain'd: So Scipio (Carthage fall'n) resign'd his plume, And smil'd at the forgetfulness of Rome. O greatly bless'd! whose evening sweetest shines, And, in unclouded slowness, calm declines! While free reflection with reverted eye, Wan'd from hot noon-tide and a troubled sky, Divides life well: the largest part, long known Thy country's claim; the last and best thy own. Here while detach'd, thy self-supported soul Resumes dominion and escapes controul; Moves with a grandeur, monarchs wish in vain, Above all fears, storms, dangers, hopes or pain; A glance sometimes from thy safe summit show, And see the dusty world look dim below: Thro' the dark throng discern huge slaves of pride Should'ring unheeded Happiness aside; Thwarted and push'd and lab'ring into name, And dignify'd with all the dirt of fame; Then with a smile superior, turn away, And lop th'exub'rance of some straggling spray; Wind thro' thy mazes to serene delight, And from the bursting bubbles shade thy sight. Yet where thou shin'st, like heav'n behind a cloud, Moving like light, all piercing, tho' not loud; The Muse shall find thee in thy blest retreat, And breathe this honest wish at Cobham's feet: Fresh as thy lakes, may all thy pleasures flow! And breezy like thy groves, thy passions blow! Wide as thy fancy, be thy spreading praise! And long and lovely as thy walks, thy days! An ODE ON THE DEATH of Mr. PELHAM. By Mr. Garrick. An honest man's the noblest work of God! Pope. Let others hail the rising sun, I bow to that whose course is run, Which sets in endless night; Whose rays benignant bless'd this isle, Made peaceful Nature round us smile With calm, but cheerful light. No bounty past provokes my praise, No future prospects prompt my lays, From real grief they flow; I catch th'alarm from Britain's fears, My sorrows fall with Britain's tears, And join a nation's woe. See—as you pass the crowded street, Despondence clouds each face you meet, All their lost friend deplore: You read in every pensive eye, You hear in ev'ry broken sigh, That Pelham is no more. If thus each Briton be alarm'd, Whom but his distant influence warm'd, What grief their breasts must rend, Who in his private virtues bless'd, By Nature's dearest tyes possess'd The Husband, Father, Friend! What! mute ye bards?—no mournful verse, No chaplets to adorn his hearse, To crown the good and just? Your flowers in warmer regions bloom, You seek no pensions from the tomb, No laurels from the dust. When pow'r departed with his breath, The sons of Flatt'ry fled from death: Such insects swarm at noon. Not for herself my Muse is griev'd, She never ask'd, nor e'er receiv'd, One ministerial boon. Hath some peculiar strange offence, Against us arm'd Omnipotence, To check the nation's pride? Behold th'appointed punishment! At length the vengeful bolt is sent, It fell—when Pelham dy'd! Uncheck'd by shame, unaw'd by dread, When Vice triumphant rears her head, Vengeance can sleep no more; The evil angel stalks at large, The good submits, resigns his charge, And quits th'unhallow'd shore. The same sad morn The 6th of March, 1754, was remarkable for the publication of the works of a late Lord, and the death of Mr. Pelham. to church and state, (So for our sins 'twas fix'd by fate) A double stroke was giv'n; Black as the whirlwinds of the north, St. J?n's fell Genius issu'd forth, And Pelham fled to heav'n! By angels watch'd in Eden's bow'rs, Our parents pass'd their peaceful hours, Nor guilt nor pain they knew; But on the day which usher'd in The hell-born train of mortal sin, The heav'nly guards withdrew. Look down, much honour'd shade, below, Still let thy pity aid our woe; Stretch out thy healing hand; Resume those feelings, which on earth Proclaim'd thy patriot love and worth, And sav'd a sinking land. Search with thy more than mortal eye, The breasts of all thy friends: descry What there has got possession. See if thy unsuspecting heart, In some for truth mistook not art, For principle, profession. From these, the pests of human kind, Whom royal bounty cannot bind, Protect our parent King: Unmask their treach'ry to his sight, Drag forth the vipers into light, And crush them ere they sting. If such his trust and honours share, Again exert thy guardian care, Each venom'd heart disclose; On Him, on Him, our all depends, Oh save him from his treach'rous friends, He cannot fear his foes. Whoe'er shall at the helm preside, Still let thy prudence be his guide, To stem the troubled wave; But chiefly whisper in his ear, “That George is open, just, sincere, “And dares to scorn a knave.” No selfish views t'oppress mankind, No mad ambition fir'd thy mind, To purchase fame with blood; Thy bosom glow'd with purer heat; Convinc'd that to be truly great, Is only to be good. To hear no lawless passion's call, To serve thy King, yet feel for all, Such was thy glorious plan! Wisdom with gen'rous love took part, Together work thy head and heart, The Minister and Man. Unite, ye kindred sons of worth; Strangle bold faction in its birth; Be Britain's weal your view! For this great end let all combine, Let virtue link each fair design, And Pelham live in you. VERSES Written at Mountauban in France, 1750. By the Rev. Mr. Joseph Warton. Tarn, how delightful wind thy willow'd waves, But ah! they fructify a land of slaves! In vain thy bare-foot, sun-burnt peasants hide With luscious grapes yon' hill's romantic side; No cups nectareous shall their toils repay, The priest's, the soldier's, and the fermier's prey: Vain glows this sun in cloudless glory drest, That strikes fresh vigour thro' the pining breast; Give me, beneath a colder, changeful sky, My soul's best, only pleasure, Liberty! What millions perish'd near thy mournful flood Alluding to the persecutions of the protestants, and the wars of the Saracens, carried on in the Southern provinces of France. When the red papal tyrant cry'd out—“Blood! Less fierce the Saracen, and quiver'd Moor, That dash'd thy infants 'gainst the stones of yore. Be warn'd ye nations round; and trembling see Dire superstition quench humanity! By all the chiefs in Freedom's battles lost; By wise and virtuous Alfred's aweful ghost; By old Galgacus' scythed, iron car, That swiftly whirling thro' the walks of war, Dash'd Roman blood, and crush'd the foreign throngs: By holy Druids' courage-breathing songs; By fierce Bonduca's shield, and foaming steeds; By the bold peers that met on Thames's meads; By the fifth Henry's helm, and lightning spear, O Liberty, my warm petition hear; Be Albion still thy joy! with her remain, Long as the surge shall lash her oak-crown'd plain! The Revenge of AMERICA. By the Same. When fierce Pisarro's legions flew O'er ravag'd fields of rich Peru, Struck with his bleeding people's woes, Old India's aweful Genius rose. He sat on Andes' topmost stone, And heard a thousand nations groan; For grief his feathery crown he tore, To see huge Plata foam with gore; He broke his arrows, stampt the ground, To view his cities smoaking round. What woes, he cry'd, hath lust of gold O'er my poor country widely roll'd; Plunderers proceed! my bowels tear, But ye shall meet destruction there; From the deep-vaulted mine shall rise Th'insatiate fiend, pale Avarice! Whose steps shall trembling Justice fly, Peace, Order, Law, and Amity! I see all Europe's children curst With lucre's universal thirst: The rage that sweeps my sons away, My baneful gold shall well repay. The Dying INDIAN. By the Same. The dart of Izdabel prevails! 'twas dipt In double poison—I shall soon arrive At the blest island, where no tigers spring On heedless hunters; where anana's bloom Thrice in each moon; where rivers smoothly glide, Nor thundering torrents whirl the light canoe Down to the sea; where my forefathers feast Daily on hearts of Spaniards!—O my son, I feel the venom busy in my breast, Approach, and bring my crown, deck'd with the teeth Of that bold christian who first dar'd deflour The virgins of the sun; and, dire to tell! Robb'd Pachacamac's altar of its gems! I mark'd the spot where they interr'd this traitor, And once at midnight stole I to his tomb, And tore his carcase from the earth, and left it A prey to poisonous flies. Preserve this crown With sacred secrecy: if e'er returns Thy much-lov'd mother from the desart woods Where, as I hunted late; I hapless lost her, Cherish her age. Tell her I ne'er have worship'd With those that eat their God. And when disease Preys on her languid limbs, then kindly stab her With thine own hands, nor suffer her to linger, Like christian cowards, in a life of pain. I go! great Copac beckons me! farewell! ODE occasion'd by Reading Mr. West's Translation of Pindar. By the Same. I. 1 Albion exult! thy sons a voice divine have heard, The man of Thebes hath in thy vales appear'd! Hark! with fresh rage and undiminish'd fire, The sweet enthusiast smites the British lyre; The sounds that echoed on Alphéus' streams, Reach the delighted ear of listening Thames; Lo! swift across the dusty plain Great Theron's foaming coursers strain! What mortal tongue e'er roll'd along Such full impetuous tides of nervous song? 2 The fearful, frigid lays of cold and creeping Art, Nor touch, nor can transport th'unfeeling heart; Pindar, our inmost bosom piercing, warms With glory's love, and eager thirst of arms: When Freedom speaks in his majestic strain, The patriot-passions beat in every vein: We long to sit with heroes old, 'Mid groves of vegetable gold, See 2. Olym. Od.Where Cadmus and Achilles dwell, And still of daring deeds and dangers tell. 3 Away, enervate bards, away, Who spin the courtly, silken lay, Alluding to the French and Italian lyric poets.As wreaths for some vain Louis' head, Or mourn some soft Adonis dead: No more your polish'd lyrics boast, In British Pindar's strength o'erwhelm'd and lost: As well might ye compare The glimmerings of a waxen flame, (Emblem of verse correctly tame) See 1. Pyth. Od. To his own Ætna's sulphur-spouting caves, When to heav'n's vault the fiery deluge raves, When clouds and burning rocks dart thro' the troubled air. II. 1 In roaring cataracts down Andes' channel'd steeps Mark how enormous Orellana sweeps! Monarch of mighty floods! supremely strong, Foaming from cliff to cliff he whirls along, Swoln with an hundred hills' collected snows: Thence over nameless regions widely flows, Round fragrant isles, and citron-groves, Where still the naked Indian roves, And safely builds his leafy bow'r, From slavery far, and curst Iberian pow'r; 2 So rapid Pindar flows.—O parent of the lyre, Let me for ever thy sweet sons admire! O ancient Greece, but chief the bard whose lays The matchless tale of Troy divine emblaze; And next Euripides, soft Pity's priest, Whose melts in useful woes the bleeding breast; And him, who paints th'incestuous king, Who soul amaze and horror wring; Teach me to taste their charms refin'd, The richest banquet of th'enraptur'd mind: 3 For the blest man, the muse's child Hor. Od. 3. L. 4., On whose auspicious birth she smil'd, Whose soul she form'd of purer fire, For whom she tun'd a golden lyre, Seeks not in fighting fields renown: No widows' midnight skrieks, nor burning town, The peaceful poet please; Nor ceaseless toils for sordid gains, Nor purple pomp, nor wide domains, Nor heaps of wealth, nor power, nor statesman's schemes, Nor all deceiv'd Ambition's feverish dreams, Lure his contented heart from the sweet vale of ease. THE PLEASURES of MELANCHOLY. Written in the Year 1745. By Mr. Thomas Warton. Mother of musings, Contemplation sage, Whose grotto stands upon the topmost rock Of Teneriff: 'mid the tempestuous night, On which, in calmest meditation held, Thou hear'st with howling winds the beating rain And drifting hail descend; or if the skies Unclouded shine, and thro' the blue serene Pale Cynthia rolls her silver-axled car, Whence gazing stedfast on the spangled vault Raptur'd thou sit'st, while murmurs indistinct Of distant billows sooth thy pensive ear With hoarse and hollow sounds; secure, self-blest, There oft thou listen'st to the wild uproar Of fleets encount'ring, that in whispers low Ascends the rocky summit, where thou dwell'st Remote from man, conversing with the spheres! O lead me, queen sublime, to solemn glooms Congenial with my soul; to cheerless shades, To ruin'd seats, or twilight cells and bow'rs, Where thoughtful Melancholy loves to muse, Her fav'rite midnight haunts. The laughing scenes Of purple Spring, where all the wanton train Of Smiles and Graces seem to lead the dance In sportive round, while from their hands they show'r Ambrosial blooms and flow'rs, no longer charm; Tempe, no more I court thy balmy breeze, Adieu green vales! ye broider'd meads, adieu! Beneath yon ruin'd abbey's moss-grown piles Oft let me sit, at twilight hour of eve, Where thro' some western window the pale moon Pours her long-levell'd rule of streaming light; While sullen sacred silence reigns around, Save the lone screech-owl's note, who builds his bow'r Amid the mould'ring caverns dark and damp, Or the calm breeze, that rustles in the leaves Of flaunting ivy, that with mantle green Invests some wasted tow'r. Or let me tread In neighb'ring walk of pines, where mus'd of old The cloyster'd brother: thro' the gloomy void That far extends beneath their ample arch As on I pace, religious horror wraps My soul in dread repose. But when the world Is clad in Midnight's raven-colour'd robe, 'Mid hollow charnels let me watch the flame Of taper dim, shedding a livid glare O'er the wan heaps; while airy voices talk Along the glimm'ring walls: or ghostly shape At distance seen, invites with beck'ning hand My lonesome steps, thro' the far-winding vaults. Nor undelightful is the solemn noon Of night, when haply wakeful from my couch I start: lo, all is motionless around! Roars not the rushing wind; the sons of men And every beast in mute oblivion lie; All nature's hush'd in silence and in sleep. O then how fearful is it to reflect, That thro' the still globe's aweful solitude, No being wakes but me! 'till stealing sleep My drooping temples bathes in opiate dews. Nor then let dreams, of wanton folly born, My senses lead thro' flowery paths of joy; But let the sacred Genius of the night Such mystic visions send, as Spenser saw, When thro' bewild'ring Fancy's magic maze, To the fell house of Busyrane, he led Th'unshaken Britomart; or Milton knew, When in abstracted thought he first conceiv'd All heav'n in tumult, and the Seraphim Come tow'ring, arm'd in adamant and gold. Let others love soft summer's ev'ning smiles, As, list'ning to the distant water-fall, They mark the blushes of the streaky west; I choose the pale December's foggy glooms. Then, when the sullen shades of ev'ning close, Where thro' the room a blindly-glimm'ring gleam The dying embers scatter, far remote From Mirth's mad shouts, that thro' th'illumin'd roof Resound with festive echo, let me sit, Blest with the lowly cricket's drowsy dirge. Then let my thought contemplative explore This fleeting state of things, the vain delights, The fruitless toils, that still our search elude, As thro' the wilderness of life we rove. This sober hour of silence will unmask False Folly's smiles, that like the dazzling spells Of wily Comus cheat th'unweeting eye With blear illusion, and persuade to drink That charmed cup, which Reason's mintage fair Unmoulds, and stamps the monster on the man. Eager we taste, but in the luscious draught Forget the pois'nous dregs that lurk beneath. Few know that elegance of soul refin'd, Whose soft sensation feels a quicker joy From Melancholy's scenes, than the dull pride Of tasteless splendor and magnificence Can e'er afford. Thus Eloise, whose mind Had languish'd to the pangs of melting love, More genuine transport found, as on some tomb Reclin'd, she watch'd the tapers of the dead; Or thro' the pillar'd iles, amid pale shrines Of imag'd saints, and intermingled graves, Mus'd a veil'd votaress: than Flavia feels, As thro' the mazes of the festive ball, Proud of her conquering charms, and beauty's blaze, She floats amid the silken sons of dress, And shines the fairest of th'assembled fair. When azure noon-tide cheers the dædal globe, And the blest regent of the golden day Rejoices in his bright meridian bow'r, How oft my wishes ask the night's return, That best befriends the melancholy mind! Hail, sacred Night! thou too shalt share my song! Sister of Ebon-scepter'd Hecat, hail! Whether in congregated clouds thou wrap'st Thy viewless chariot, or with silver crown Thy beaming head encirclest, ever hail! What tho' beneath thy gloom the sorceress-train, Far in obscured haunt of Lapland-moors, With rhymes uncouth the bloody cauldron bless; Tho' Murder wan, beneath thy shrouding shade Summons her slow-ey'd vot'ries to devise Of secret slaughter, while by one blue lamp In hideous conf'rence sits the listening band, And start at each low wind, or wakeful sound: What tho' thy stay the pilgrim curseth oft, As all benighted in Arabian wastes He hears the wilderness around him howl With roaming monsters, while on his hoar head The black-descending tempest ceaseless beats; Yet more delightful to my pensive mind Is thy return, than bloomy morn's approach, Ev'n then, in youthful prime of opening May, When from the portals of the saffron east She sheds fresh roses, and ambrosial dews. Yet not ungrateful is the morn's approach, When dropping wet she comes, and clad in clouds, While thro' the damp air scowls the louring south, Blackening the landscape's face, that grove and hill In formless vapours undistinguish'd swim: Th'afflicted songsters of the sadden'd groves Hail not the sullen gloom; the waving elms That hoar thro' time, and rang'd in thick array, Enclose with stately row some rural hall, Are mute, nor echo with the clamors hoarse Of rooks rejoicing on their airy boughs; While to the shed the dripping poultry crowd, A mournful train; secure the village-hind Hangs o'er the crackling blaze, nor tempts the storm; Fix'd in th'unfinish'd furrow rests the plough: Rings not the high wood with enliv'ning shouts Of early hunter: all is silence drear; And deepest sadness wraps the face of things. Thro' Pope's soft song tho' all the Graces breathe, And happiest art adorn his Attic page; Yet does my mind with sweeter transport glow, As at the root of mossy trunk reclin'd, In magic Spenser's wildly-warbled song I see deserted Una wander wide Thro' wasteful solitudes, and lurid heaths Weary, forlorn; than when the Belinda. See Rape of the Lock. fated fair, Upon the bosom bright of silver Thames, Launches in all the lustre of brocade, Amid the splendors of the laughing Sun. The gay description palls upon the sense, And coldly strikes the mind with feeble bliss. Ye Youths of Albion's beauty-blooming isle, Whose brows have worn the wreath of luckless love, Is there a pleasure like the pensive mood, Whose magic wont to sooth your soften'd souls? O tell how rapturous the joy, to melt To Melody's assuasive voice; to bend Th'uncertain step along the midnight mead, And pour your sorrows to the pitying moon, By many a slow trill from the bird of woe Oft interrupted; in embowering woods By darksome brook to muse, and there forget The solemn dulness of the tedious world, While Fancy grasps the visionary fair: And now no more th'abstracted ear attends The water's murm'ring lapse, th'entranced eye Pierces no longer thro' th'extended rows Of thick-rang'd trees; 'till haply from the depth The woodman's stroke, or distant-tinkling team, Or heifer rustling thro' the brake alarms Th'illuded sense, and mars the golden dream. These are delights that absence drear has made Familiar to my soul, e'er since the form Of young Sapphira, beauteous as the Spring, When from her vi'let-woven couch awak'd By frolic Zephyr's hand, her tender cheek Graceful she lifts, and blushing from her bow'r, Issues to cloath in gladsome-glist'ring green The genial globe, first met my dazzled sight: These are delights unknown to minds profane, And which alone the pensive soul can taste. The taper'd choir, at the late hour of pray'r, Oft let me tread, while to th'according voice The many-sounding organ peals on high, The clear slow-dittyed chaunt, or varied hymn, 'Till all my soul is bath'd in ecstasies, And lap'd in Paradise. Or let me sit Far in sequester'd iles of the deep dome, There lonesome listen to the sacred sounds, Which, as they lengthen thro' the Gothic vaults, In hollow murmurs reach my ravish'd ear. Nor when the lamps expiring yield to night, And solitude returns, would I forsake The solemn mansion, but attentive hear The due clock swinging slow with sweepy sway, Measuring Time's flight with momentary sound. Nor let me fail to cultivate my mind With the soft thrillings of the tragic Muse, Divine Melpomene, sweet Pity's nurse, Queen of the stately step, and flowing pall. Now let Monimia mourn with streaming eyes Her joys incestuous, and polluted love: Now let soft Juliet in the gaping tomb Print the last kiss on her true Romeo's lips, His lips yet reeking from the dreadly draught. Or Jaffeir kneel for one forgiving look. Nor seldom let the Moor of Desdemone Pour the misguided threats of jealous rage. By soft degrees the manly torrent steals From my swoln eyes; and at a brother's woe My big heart melts in sympathizing tears. What are the splendors of the gaudy court, Its tinsel trappings, and its pageant pomps? To me far happier seems the banish'd Lord Amid Siberia's unrejoycing wilds Who pines all lonesome, in the chambers hoar Of some high castle shut, whose windows dim In distant ken discover trackless plains, Where Winter ever whirls his icy car; While still-repeated objects of his view, The gloomy battlements, and ivied spires That crown the solitary dome, arise; While from the topmost turret the slow clock, Far heard along th'inhospitable wastes, With sad-returning chime awakes new grief; Ev'n he far happier seems than is the proud, The potent Satrap whom he left behind 'Mid Moscow's golden palaces, to drown In ease and luxury the laughing hours. Illustrious objects strike the gazer's mind With feeble bliss, and but allure the sight, Nor rouze with impulse quick th'unfeeling heart. Thus seen by shepherd from Hymettus' brow, What dædal landscapes smile! here balmy groves, Resounding once with Plato's voice, arise, Amid whose umbrage green her silver head Th'unfading olive lifts; her vine-clad hills Lay forth their purple store, and sunny vales In prospect vast their level laps expand, Amid whose beauties glistering Athens tow'rs. Tho' thro' the blissful scenes Ilissus roll His sage-inspiring flood, whose winding marge The thick-wove laurel shades; tho' roseate Morn Pour all her splendors on th'empurpled scene; Yet feels the hoary Hermit truer joys, As from the cliff that o'er his cavern hangs He views the piles of fall'n Persepolis In deep arrangement hide the darksome plain. Unbounded waste! the mould'ring obelisc Here, like a blasted oak, ascends the clouds; Here Parian domes their vaulted halls disclose Horrid with thorn, where lurks th'unpitying thief, Whence flits the twilight-loving bat at eve, And the deaf adder wreathes her spotted train, The dwellings once of elegance and art. Here temples rise, amid whose hallow'd bounds Spires the black pine, while thro' the naked street, Once haunt of tradeful merchants, springs the grass: Here columns heap'd on prostrate columns, torn From their firm base, increase the mould'ring mass. Far as the sight can pierce, appear the spoils Of sunk magnificence! a blended scene Of moles, fanes, arches, domes, and palaces, Where, with his brother Horror, Ruin sits. O come then, Melancholy, queen of thought! O come with saintly look, and stedfast step, From forth thy cave embower'd with mournful yew, Where to the distant curfeu's solemn sound List'ning thou sitt'st, and with thy cypress bind Thy votary's hair, and seal him for thy son. But never let Euphrósyne beguile With toys of wanton mirth my fixed mind, Nor in my path her primrose-garland cast. Tho' 'mid her train the dimpled Hebe bare Her rosy bosom to th'enamour'd view; Tho' Venus, mother of the Smiles and Loves, And Bacchus, ivy-crown'd, in citron-bow'r With her on nectar-streaming fruitage feast: What tho' 'tis her's to calm the low'ring skies, And at her presence mild th'embattel'd clouds Disperse in air, and o'er the face of heav'n New day diffusive gleam at her approach; Yet are these joys that Melancholy gives, Than all her witless revels happier far; These deep-felt joys, by Contemplation taught. Then ever, beauteous Contemplation, hail! From thee began, auspicious maid, my song, With thee shall end: for thou art fairer far Than are the nymphs of Cirrha's mossy grot; To loftier rapture thou canst wake the thought, Than all the fabling Poet's boasted pow'rs. Hail, queen divine! whom, as tradition tells, Once, in his ev'ning-walk a Druid found, Far in a hollow glade of Mona's woods; And piteous bore with hospitable hand To the close shelter of his oaken bow'r. There soon the sage admiring mark'd the dawn Of solemn musing in your pensive thought; For when a smiling babe, you lov'd to lie Oft deeply list'ning to the rapid roar Of wood-hung Meinai, stream of Druids old, That lav'd his hallow'd haunt with dashing wave. A SONNET; written at W?de in the Absence of ?. By the Same. W?de, thy beechen slopes with waving grain Border'd, thine azure views of wood and lawn, Whilom could charm, or when the joyous Dawn 'Gan Night's dun robe with flushing purple stain, Or Evening drove to fold her woolly train; Her fairest landscapes whence my Muse has drawn, Too free with servile courtly phrase to fawn, Too weak to try the Buskin's stately strain; Yet now no more thy slopes of beech and corn Nor prospects charm, since He far-distant strays With whom I trac'd their sweets each eve and morn, From Albion far, to cull Hesperian bays; In this alone they please, howe'er forlorn, That still they can recall those happier days. On BATHING. A SONNET. By the Same. When late the trees were stript by Winter pale, Fair Health, a Dryad-maid in vesture green, Rejoyc'd to rove 'mid the bleak sylvan scene, On airy uplands caught the fragrant gale, And ere fresh morn the low-couch'd lark did hail Watching the sound of earliest horn was seen. But since gay Summer, thron'd in chariot sheen, Is come to scorch each primrose sprinkled dale, She chuses that delightful cave beneath The crystal treasures of meek Isis' stream; And now all glad the temperate air to breathe, While cooling drops distil from arches dim, Binding her dewy locks with sedgy wreath She sits amid the quire of Naiads trim. To Lady H?y. By Mr. de Voltaire. H?y would you know the passion You have kindled in my breast, Trifling is the inclination That by words can be express'd. In my silence see the lover, True love is by silence known; In my eyes you'll best discover All the power of your own. On Sir Robert Walpole's Birth-day, August the 26th. By the Honourable Mr. D?ton. All hail, auspicious day, whose wish'd return Bids every breast with grateful ardor burn, While pleas'd Britannia that great man surveys The Prince may trust, and yet the People praise: One bearing greatest toils with greatest ease, One born to serve us, and yet born to please; His soul capacious, yet his judgment clear, His tongue is flowing, and his heart sincere: His counsels guide, his temper cheers our isle, And smiling gives three kingdoms cause to smile. August, how bright thy golden scenes appear, Thou fairest daughter of the various year, On thee the sun with all his ardor glows, On thee in dowry all its fruits bestows, The greatest Prince, the foremost son of fame, To thee bequeath'd the glories of his name; Nature and Fortune thee their darling chose, Nor could they grace thee more, 'till Walpole rose. By steps to mighty things Fate makes her way, The sun and Cæsar but prepar'd this day. The Lawyer's Farewell to his Muse. Written in the Year 1744. As, by some tyrant's stern command, A wretch forsakes his native land, In foreign climes condemn'd to roam An endless exile from his home; Pensive he treads the destin'd way, And dreads to go, nor dares to stay; 'Till on some neighb'ring mountain's brow He stops, and turns his eyes below; There, melting at the well-known view, Drops a last tear, and bids adieu: So I, thus doom'd from thee to part, Gay queen of Fancy and of Art, Reluctant move, with doubtful mind, Oft stop, and often look behind. Companion of my tender age, Serenely gay, and sweetly sage, How blithsome were we wont to rove By verdant hill, or shady grove, Where fervent bees, with humming voice, Around the honey'd oak rejoice, And aged elms with aweful bend In long cathedral walks extend! Lull'd by the lapse of gliding floods, Cheer'd by the warbling of the woods, How blest my days, my thoughts how free, In sweet society with thee! Then all was joyous, all was young, And years unheeded roll'd along: But now the pleasing dream is o'er, These scenes must charm me now no more, Lost to the field, and torn from you,— Farewel!—a long, a last adieu. Me wrangling courts, and stubborn Law, To smoak, and crowds, and cities draw; There selfish Faction rules the day, And Pride and Av'rice throng the way: Diseases taint the murky air, And midnight conflagrations glare; Loose Revelry and Riot bold In frighted streets their orgies hold; Or, when in silence all is drown'd, Fell Murder walks her lonely round: No room for peace, no room for you, Adieu, celestial Nymph, adieu! Shakespear no more thy sylvan son, Nor all the art of Addison, Pope's heav'n-strung lyre, nor Waller's ease, Nor Milton's mighty self must please: Instead of these, a formal band In furs and coifs around me stand; With sounds uncouth and accents dry That grate the soul of harmony, Each pedant sage unlocks his store Of mystic, dark, discordant lore; And points with tott'ring hand the ways That lead me to the thorny maze. There, in a winding, close retreat, Is Justice doom'd to fix her seat, There, fenc'd by bulwarks of the Law, She keeps the wond'ring world in awe, And there, from vulgar sight retir'd, Like eastern queens is more admir'd. O let me pierce the secret shade Where dwells the venerable maid! There humbly mark, with rev'rent awe, The guardian of Britannia's Law, Unfold with joy her sacred page, (Th'united boast of many an age, Where mix'd, yet uniform, appears The wisdom of a thousand years) In that pure spring the bottom view, Clear, deep, and regularly true, And other doctrines thence imbibe Than lurk within the sordid scribe; Observe how parts with parts unite In one harmonious rule of right; See countless wheels distinctly tend By various laws to one great end; While mighty Alfred's piercing soul Pervades, and regulates the whole. Then welcome business, welcome strife, Welcome the cares, the thorns of life, The visage wan, the pore-blind sight, The toil by day, the lamp at night, The tedious forms, the solemn prate, The pert dispute, the dull debate, The drowsy bench, the babling Hall, For thee, fair Justice, welcome all! Thus tho' my noon of life be past, Yet let my setting sun, at last, Find out the still, the rural cell, Where sage Retirement loves to dwell! There let me taste the homefelt bliss Of innocence, and inward peace; Untainted by the guilty bribe; Uncurs'd amid the harpy-tribe; No orphan's cry to wound my ear; My honour, and my conscience clear; Thus may I calmly meet my end, Thus to the grave in peace descend! By Miss Cooper (now Mrs. Madan) in her Brother's Coke upon Littleton. O thou, who labour'st in this rugged mine, May'st thou to gold th'unpolish'd ore refine! May each dark page unfold its haggard brow! Doubt not to reap, if thou canst bear to plough. To tempt thy care, may each revolving night, Purses and maces swim before thy sight! From hence in times to come, advent'rous deed! May'st thou essay, to look and speak like Mead. When the black bag and rose no more shall shade With martial air the honours of thy head; When the full wig thy visage shall enclose, And only leave to view they learned nose: Safely may'st thou defy beaux, wits, and scoffers; While tenants, in fee simple, stuff thy coffers. SOLITUDE. An ODE. By Dr. Grainger. I. O solitude, romantic Maid, Whether by nodding towers you tread, Or haunt the desart's trackless gloom, Or hover o'er the yawning tomb, Or climb the Andes' clifted side, Or by the Nile's coy source abide, Or starting from your half-year's sleep From Hecla view the thawing deep, Or Tadmor's marble wastes survey, Or in yon roofless cloyster stray; You, Recluse, again I woo, And again your steps pursue. II. Plum'd Conceit himself surveying, Folly with her shadow playing, Purse-proud, elbowing Insolence, Bloated empirick, puff'd Pretence, Noise that thro' a trumpet speaks, Laughter in loud peals that breaks, Intrusion with a fopling's face, (Ignorant of time and place) Sparks of fire Dissention blowing, Ductile, court-bred Flattery, bowing, Restraint's stiff neck, Grimace's leer, Squint-ey'd Censure's artful sneer, Ambition's buskins steep'd in blood, Fly thy presence, Solitude. III. Sage Reflection bent with years, Conscious Virtue void of fears, Muffled Silence, wood-nymph shy, Meditation's piercing eye, Halcyon Peace on moss reclin'd, Retrospect that scans the mind, Rapt earth-gazing Resvery, Blushing artless Modesty, Health that snuffs the morning air, Full-ey'd Truth with bosom bare, Inspiration, Nature's child, Seek the solitary wild. IV. You with the tragic Muse In the island Salamis. retir'd The wise Euripides inspir'd, You taught the sadly-pleasing air That See Plutarch in the life of Lysander. Athens sav'd from ruins bare. You gave the Cean's tears to flow, And Simonides. unlock'd the springs of woe; You penn'd what exil'd Naso thought, And pour'd the melancholy note. With Petrarch o'er Valcluse you stray'd, When Death snatch'd his Laura, twenty years, and ten after her death. long-lov'd maid; You taught the rocks her loss to mourn, Ye strew'd with flowers her virgin urn. And late in Monody on the death of Mrs. Lyttelton. Hagley you were seen, With bloodshed eyes, and sombre mien, Hymen his yellow vestment tore, And Dirge a wreath of cypress wore. But chief your own the solemn lay That wept Narcissa young and gay, Darkness clap'd her sable wing, While you touch'd the mournful string, Anguish left the pathless wild, Grim-fac'd Melancholy smil'd, Drowsy Midnight ceas'd to yawn, The starry host put back the dawn, Aside their harps ev'n Seraphs flung To hear thy sweet complaint, O Young. V. When all Nature's hush'd asleep, Nor Love nor Guilt their vigils keep, Soft you leave your cavern'd den, And wander o'er the works of men, But when Phosphor brings the dawn By her dappled coursers drawn, Again you to the wild retreat And the early huntsman meet, Where as you pensive pace along, You catch the distant shepherd's song, Or brush from herbs the pearly dew, Or the rising primrose view. Devotion lends her heaven-plum'd wings, You mount, and Nature with you sings. But when mid-day fervors glow, To upland airy shades you go, Where never sunburnt woodman came, Nor sportsman chas'd the timid game; And there beneath an oak reclin'd, With drowsy waterfalls behind, You sink to rest. 'Till the tuneful bird of night From the neighb'ring poplars height Wake you with her solemn strain, And teach pleas'd Echo to complain. VI. With you roses brighter bloom Sweeter every sweet perfume, Purer every fountain flows Stronger every wilding grows. VII. Let those toil for gold who please, Or for fame renounce their ease. What is fame? an empty bubble, Gold? a transient, shining trouble. Let them for their country bleed, What was Sidney's, Raleigh's meed? Man's not worth a moment's pain, Base, ungrateful, fickle, vain. Then let me, sequester'd fair, To your Sibyl grot repair, On yon hanging cliff it stands Scoop'd by Nature's salvage hands, Bosom'd in the gloomy shade Of cypress not with age decay'd. Where the owl still-hooting sits, Where the bat incessant flits, There in loftier strains I'll sing Whence the changing seasons spring, Tell how storms deform the skies, Whence the waves subside and rise, Trace the comet's blazing tail, Weigh the planets in a scale; Bend, great God, before thy shrine, The bournless macrocosm's thine. VIII. Save me! what's yon shrouded shade? That wanders in the dark-brown glade. It beckons me!—vain fears adieu, Mysterious ghost, I follow you. Ah me! too well that gait I know, My youth's first firiend, my manhood's woe! Its breast it bares! what! stain'd with blood? Quick let me stanch the vital flood. Oh spirit, whither art thou flown? Why left me comfortless alone? O Solitude, on me bestow The heart-felt harmony of woe, Such, such, as on th'Ausonian shore, Sweet See Idyll. Dorian Moschus trill'd of yore: No time should cancel thy desert, More, more, than Alluding to the death of a friend. Bion was, thou wert. IX. O goddess of the tearful eye, The never-ceasing stream supply. Let us with Retirement go To charnels, and the house of woe, O'er Friendship's herse low-drooping mourn, Where the sickly tapers burn, Where Death and nun-clad Sorrow dwell, And nightly ring the solemn knell. The gloom dispels, the charnel smiles, Light flashes thro' the vaulted iles. Blow silky soft, thou western gale, O goddess of the desert, hail! She bursts from yon cliff-riven cave, Insulted by the wintry wave; Her brow an ivy garland binds, Her tresses wanton with the winds, A lion's spoils, without a zone, Around her limbs are careless thrown; Her right hand wields a knotted mace, Her eyes roll wild, a stride her pace; Her left a magic mirror holds, In which she oft herself beholds. O goddess of the desart, hail! And softer blow, thou western gale! Since in each scheme of life I've fail'd, And disappointment seems entail'd; Since all on earth I valued most, My guide, my stay, my friend is lost; You, only you, can make me blest, And hush the tempest in my breast. Then gently deign to guide my feet To your hermit-trodden seat, Where I may live at last my own, Where I at last may die unknown. I spoke, she twin'd her magic ray, And thus she said, or seem'd to say. Youth, you're mistaken, if you think to find In shades a medicine for a troubled mind; Wan Grief will haunt you wheresoe'er you go, Sigh in the breeze, and in the streamlet flow, There pale Inaction pines his life away, And, satiate, curses the return of day: There naked Frenzy laughing wild with pain, Or bares the blade, or plunges in the main: There Superstition broods o'er all her fears, And yells of dæmons in the Zephyr hears. But if a hermit you're resolv'd to dwell, And bid to social life a last farewell; 'Tis impious.— God never made an independent man, 'Twould jarr the concord of his general plan: See every part of that stupendous whole, “Whose body Nature is, and God the soul;” To one great end, the general good, conspire, From matter, brute, to man, to seraph, fire. Should man thro' Nature solitary roam, His will his sovereign, every where his home, What force wou'd guard him from the lion's jaw? What swiftness wing him from the panther's paw? Or should Fate lead him to some safer shore, Where panthers never prowl, nor lions roar; Where liberal Nature all her charms bestows, Suns shine, birds sing, flowers bloom, and water flows, Fool, dost thou think he'd revel on the store, Absolve the care of Heaven, nor ask for more? Tho' waters flow'd, flow'rs bloom'd, and Phœbus shone, He'd sigh, he'd murmur that he was alone. For know, the Maker on the human breast A sense of kindred, country, man, imprest; And social life to better, aid, adorn, With proper faculties each mortal's born. Tho' Nature's works the ruling mind declare, And well deserve enquiry's serious care, The God (whate'er Misanthrophy may say) Shines, beams in man with most unclouded ray. What boots it thee to fly from pole to pole? Hang o'er the sun, and with the planets roll? What boots thro' space's furthest bourns to roam? If thou, O man, a stranger art at home. Then know thyself, the human mind survey, The use, the pleasure will the toil repay. Hence Inspiration plans his manner'd lays, Hence Homer's crown, and Shakespear hence thy bays. Hence he, the pride of Athens and the shame, The best and wisest of mankind became. Nor study only, practise what you know, Your life, your knowledge, to mankind you owe. With Plato's olive wreath the bays entwine: Those who in study, shou'd in practice shine. Say, does the learned Lord of Hagley's shade, Charm man so much by mossy fountains laid, As when arouz'd, he stems Corruption's course, And shakes the senate with a Tully's force? When Freedom gasp'd beneath a Cæsar's feet, Then publick Virtue might to shades retreat; But where she breathes, the least may useful be, And Freedom, Britain, still belong to thee. Tho' man's ungrateful, or tho' Fortune frown; Is the reward of worth a song, or crown? Nor yet unrecompens'd are Virtue's pains, Good Allen lives, and bounteous Brunswick reigns. On each condition disappointments wait, Enter the hut, and force the guarded gate. Nor dare repine, tho' early Friendship bleed, From love, the world, and all its cares he's freed. But know, Adversity's the child of God; Whom Heaven approves of most, most feel her rod. When smooth old Ocean and each storm's asleep, Then Ignorance may plough the watery deep; But when the dæmons of the tempest rave, Skill must conduct the vessel thro' the wave. Sidney, what good man envies not thy blow? Who wou'd not wish One of the accusers of Socrates. Anytus for a foe? Intrepid Virtue triumphs over Fate, The good can never be unfortunate. And be this maxim graven in thy mind, The height of virtue is to serve mankind. But when old age has silver'd o'er thy head, When memory fails, and all thy vigour's fled, Then may'st thou seek the stillness of retreat, Then hear aloof the human tempest beat, Then will I greet thee to my woodland cave, Allay the pangs of age, and smooth thy grave. An ODE To the Right Honourable Stephen Poyntz, Esq; &amp;c. &amp;c. By the Honourable Sir Charles Han. Williams, Kt. of the Bath. Sensere quid mens rite, quid indoles Nutrita faustis sub penetralibus Posset ? Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam, Rectique cultus pectora roborant. Hor. Od. 4. Lib. 4. I Whilst William's deeds and William's praise Each English breast with transport raise, Each English tongue employ; Say, Poyntz, is thy elated heart Assumes not a superior part, A larger share of joy? II But that thy country's high affairs Employ thy time, demand thy cares, You shou'd renew your flight; You only shou'd this theme pursue— Who can for William feel like you? Or who like you can write? III Then to rehearse the Hero's praise, To paint this sunshine of his days, The pleasing task be mine— To think on all thy cares o'erpaid, To view the Hero you have made, That pleasing part be thine. IV Who first should watch, and who call forth This youthful Prince's various worth, You had the publick voice; Wisely his royal Sire consign'd To you, the culture of his mind, And England blest the choice. V You taught him to be early known By martial deeds of courage shewn: From this, near Mona's flood, By his victorious Father led, He flesh'd his maiden sword, he shed, And prov'd th'illustrious blood. VI Of Virtue's various charms you taught, With happiness and glory fraught, How her unshaken pow'r Is independent of success; That no defeat can make it less, No conquest make it more, VII This, after Tournay's fatal day, 'Midst sorrow, cares, and dire dismay, Brought calm, and sure relief; He scrutiniz'd his noble heart, Found Virtue had perform'd her part, And peaceful slept the Chief. VIII From thee he early learnt to feel The Patriot's warmth for England's weal; (True Valour's noblest spring) To vindicate her Church distrest; To fight for Liberty opprest; To perish for his King. IX Yet say, if in thy fondest scope Of thought, you ever dar'd to hope That bounteous heaven so soon Would pay thy toils, reward thy care, Consenting bend to ev'ry pray'r, And all thy wishes crown? X We saw a wretch with trait'rous aid, Our King's and Church's rights invade: And thine, fair Liberty! We saw thy Hero fly to war, Beat down Rebellion, break her spear, And set the nation free. XI Culloden's field, my glorious theme, My rapture, vision, and my dream, Gilds the young Hero's days: Yet can there be one English heart That does not give thee, Poyntz, thy part, And own thy share of praise? XII Nor is thy fame to thee decreed For life's short date: when William's head, For victories to come, The frequent laurel shall receive: Chaplets for thee our sons shall weave, And hang 'em on thy tomb. ODE on the Death of Matzel, a favourite Bull-finch, address'd to Mr. St?pe, to whom the Author had given the Reversion of it when he left Dresden. By the Same. I Try not my St?pe, 'tis in vain To stop your tears, to hide your pain, Or check your honest rage; Give sorrow and revenge their scope, My present joy, your future hope, Lies murder'd in his cage. II Matzel's no more, ye graces, loves, Ye linnets, nightingales and doves, Attend th'untimely bier; Let ev'ry sorrow be exprest, Beat with your wings each mournful breast, And drop the nat'ral tear. III In height of song, in beauty's pride, By fell Grimalkin's claws he died— But vengeance shall have way; On pains and tortures I'll refine; Yet, Matzel, that one death of thine, His nine will ill repay. IV For thee, my bird, the sacred Nine, Who lov'd thy tuneful notes, shall join In thy funereal verse: My painful task shall be to write Th'eternal dirge which they indite, And hang it on thy hearse. V In vain I lov'd, in vain I mourn My bird, who never to return Is fled to happier shades, Where Lesbia shall for him prepare The place most charming, and most fair Of all th'Elysian glades. VI There shall thy notes in cypress grove Sooth wretched ghosts that died for love; There shall thy plaintive strain Lull impious Phædra's endless grief, To Procris yield some short relief, And soften Dido's pain. VII 'Till Proserpine by chance shall hear Thy notes, and make thee all her care, And love thee with my love; While each attendant's soul shall praise The matchless Matzel's tuneful lays, And all his songs approve. MARTIALIS EPIGRAMMA. Lib. vi. Ep. 24. Imitated. By the Same. Come, Chloe, and give me sweet kisses, For sweeter sure never girl gave: But why in the midst of my blisses Do you ask me how many I'd have? I'm not to be stinted in pleasure, Then pr'ythee my charmer be kind, For whilst I love thee above measure, To numbers I'll ne'er be confin'd. Count the bees that on Hybla are playing, Count the flow'rs that enamel its fields, Count the flocks that on Tempe are straying, Or the grain that rich Sicily yields; Go number the stars in the heaven, Count how many sands on the shore, When so many kisses you've given I still shall be craving for more. To a heart full of love let me hold thee, To a heart which, dear Chloe, is thine; With my arms I'll for ever enfold thee, And twist round thy limbs like a vine. What joy can be greater than this is? My life on thy lips shall be spent; But the wretch that can number his kisses With few will be ever content. The Progress of DISCONTENT. A POEM. Written at Oxford in the Year 1746. When now mature in classic knowledge, The joyful youth is sent to college, His father comes, a vicar plain, At Oxford bred—in Anna's reign, And thus in form of humble suitor Bowing accosts a reverend tutor. “Sir, I'm a Glo'stershire divine, “And this my eldest son of nine; “My wife's ambition and my own “Was that this child should wear a gown: “I'll warrant that his good behaviour “Will justify your future favour: “And for his parts, to tell the truth, “My son's a very forward youth; “Has Horace all by heart—you'd wonder— “And mouths out Homer's Greek like thunder. “If you'd examine—and admit him, “A scholarship would nicely fit him: “That he succeeds 'tis ten to one; “Your vote and interest, Sir!—'Tis done.” Our pupil's hopes, tho' twice defeated, Are with a scholarship compleated: A scholarship but half maintains, And college rules are heavy chains: In garret dark he smokes and puns, A prey to discipline and duns; And now intent on new designs, Sighs for a fellowship—and fines. When nine full tedious winters past, That utmost wish is crown'd at last: But the rich prize no sooner got, Again he quarrels with his lot: “These fellowships are pretty things, “We live indeed like petty kings: “But who can bear to waste his whole age “Amid the dullness of a college, “Debarr'd the common joys of life, “And that prime bliss—a loving wife! “O! what's a table richly spread “Without a woman at its head! “Would some snug benefice but fall, “Ye feasts, ye dinners! farewel all! “To offices I'd bid adieu, “Of dean, vice præs.—of bur “Come joys, that rural quiet yields, “Come, tythes, and house, and fruitful fields!” Too fond of liberty and ease A patriot's vanity to please, Long time he watches, and by stealth, Each frail incumbent's doubtful health; At length—and in his fortieth year, A living drops—two hundred clear! With breast elate beyond expression, He hurries down to take possession, With rapture views the sweet retreat— “What a convenient house! how neat! “For fuel here's sufficient wood: “Pray God the cellars may be good! “The garden—that must be new plann'd— “Shall these old-fashion'd yew-trees stand? “O'er yonder vacant plot shall rise “The flow'ry shrub of thousand dies:— “Yon' wall, that feels the southern ray, “Shall blush with ruddy fruitage gay; “While thick beneath its aspect warm “O'er well-rang'd hives the bees shall swarm, “From which, ere long, of golden gleam “Metheglin's luscious juice shall stream: “This aukward hut o'er-grown with ivy, “We'll alter to a modern privy: “Up yon' green slope, of hazels trim, “An avenue so cool and dim, “Shall to an arbour, at the end, “In spite of gout, intice a friend. “My predecessor lov'd devotion— “But of a garden had no notion.” Continuing this fantastic farce on, He now commences country parson. To make his character entire, He weds—a cousin of the 'squire; Not over-weighty in the purse, But many doctors have done worse: And tho' she boast no charms divine, Yet she can carve, and make birch wine. Thus fixt, content he taps his barrel, Exhorts his neighbours not to quarrel: Finds his church-wardens have discerning Both in good liquor and good learning; With tythes his barns replete he sees, And chuckles o'er his surplice fees; Studies to find out latent dues, And regulates the state of pews; Rides a sleek mare with purple housing, To share the monthly club's carousing; Of Oxford pranks facetious tells, And—but on Sundays—hears no bells; Sends presents of his choicest fruit, And prunes himself each sapless shoot, Plants colliflow'rs, and boasts to rear The earliest melons of the year; Thinks alteration charming work is, Keeps Bantam cocks, and feeds his turkies; Builds in his copse a favourite bench, And stores the pond with carp and tench.— But ah! too soon his thoughtless breast By cares domestic is opprest; And a third butcher's bill, and brewing, Threaten inevitable ruin: For children fresh expences yet, And Dicky now for school is fit. “Why did I sell my college life “(He cries) for benefice and wife? “Return, ye days! when endless pleasure “I found in reading, or in leisure! “When calm around the common room “I puff'd my daily pipe's perfume! “Rode for a stomach, and inspected “At annual bottlings, corks selected: “And din'd untax'd, untroubled, under “The pourtrait of our pious founder! “When impositions were supply'd “To light my pipe—or sooth my pride— “No cares were then for forward peas “A yearly-longing wife to please: “My thoughts no christ'ning dinner crost, “No children cry'd for butter'd toast; “And ev'ry night I went to bed, “Without a Modus in my head!” Oh! trifling head, and fickle heart! Chagrin'd at whatsoe'er thou art; A dupe to follies yet untry'd, And sick of pleasures, scarce enjoy'd! Each prize possess'd, thy transport ceases, And in pursuit alone it pleases. The FIRE-SIDE. By Dr. COTTON. I Dear Chloe, while the busy crowd, The vain, the wealthy, and the proud, In Folly's maze advance; Tho' singularity and pride Be call'd our choice, we'll step aside, Nor join the giddy dance. II From the gay world we'll oft retire To our own family and fire, Where love our hours employs; No noisy neighbour enters here, No intermeddling stranger near, To spoil our heart-felt joys. III If solid happiness we prize, Within our breast this jewel lies; And they are fools who roam: The world has nothing to bestow, From our own selves our joys must flow, And that dear hut, our home. IV Of rest was Noah's dove bereft, When with impatient wing she left That safe retreat, the ark; Giving her vain excursion o'er, The disappointed bird once more Explor'd the sacred bark. V Tho' fools spurn Hymen's gentle pow'rs, We, who improve his golden hours, By sweet experience know, That marriage, rightly understood, Gives to the tender and the good A paradise below. VI Our babes shall richest comforts bring, If tutor'd right, they'll prove a spring, Whence pleasures ever rise: We'll form their minds with studious care, To all that's manly, good, and fair, And train them for the skies. VII While they our wisest hours engage, They'll joy our youth, support our age, And crown our hoary hairs: They'll grow in virtue ev'ry day, And thus our fondest loves repay, And recompense our cares. VIII No borrow'd joys! they're all our own, While to the world we live unknown, Or by the world forgot: Monarchs! we envy not your state, We look with pity on the great, And bless our humbler lot. IX Our portion is not large indeed, But then, how little do we need, For Nature's calls are few! In this the art of living lies, To want no more than may suffice, And make that little do. X We'll therefore relish with content Whate'er kind Providence has sent, Nor aim beyond our pow'r; For if our stock be very small, 'Tis prudence to enjoy it all, Nor lose the present hour. XI To be resign'd, when ills betide, Patient, when favours are deny'd, And pleas'd with favours giv'n; Dear Chloe, this is wisdom's part, This is that incense of the heart, Whose fragrance smells to heav'n. XII We'll ask no long protracted treat, (Since winter life is seldom sweet;) But when our feast is o'er, Grateful from table we'll arise, Nor grudge our sons with envious eyes, The relicks of our store. XIII Thus hand in hand thro' life we'll go, Its checker'd paths of joy and woe With cautious steps we'll tread; Quit its vain scenes without a tear, Without a trouble or a fear, And mingle with the dead. XIV While Conscience, like a faithful friend, Shall thro' the gloomy vale attend, And cheer our dying breath; Shall, when all other comforts cease, Like a kind angel whisper peace, And smooth the bed of death. TO-MORROW. By the Same. Pereunt et Imputantur. To-morrow, didst thou say! Methought I heard Horatio say, To-morrow. Go to—I will not hear of it—To-morrow! 'Tis a sharper, who stakes his penury Against thy plenty—who takes thy ready cash, And pays thee nought but wishes, hopes, and promises, The currency of ideots.—Injurious bankrupt, That gulls the easy creditor!—To-morrow! It is a period no where to be found In all the hoary registers of Time, Unless perchance in the fool's calendar. Wisdom disclaims the word, nor holds society With those who own it. No, my Horatio, 'Tis Fancy's child, and Folly is its father; Wrought of such stuff as dreams are; and baseless As the fantastic visions of the evening. But soft, my friend—arrest the present moments; For be assur'd, they all are arrant tell-tales; And tho' their flight be silent, and their path Trackless, as the wing'd couriers of the air, They post to heav'n, and there record thy folly. Because, tho' station'd on th'important watch, Thou, like a sleeping, faithless centinel, Didst let them pass unnotic'd, unimprov'd. And know, for that thou slumber'dst on the guard, Thou shalt be made to answer at the bar For ev'ry fugitive: and when thou thus Shalt stand impleaded at the high tribunal Of hood-wink'd Justice, who shall tell thy audit! Then stay the present instant, dear Horatio; Imprint the marks of wisdom on its wings. 'Tis of more worth than kingdoms! far more precious Than all the crimson treasures of life's fortune. Oh! let it not elude thy grasp, but like The good old patriarch upon record, Hold the fleet angel-fast, until he bless thee. On Lord Cobham's Gardens. By the Same. It puzzles much the sages' brains, Where Eden stood of yore; Some place it in Arabia's plains, Some say, it is no more. But Cobham can these tales confute, As all the curious know; For he has prov'd beyond dispute, That paradise is Stow. To a Child of Five Years old. By the Same. Fairest flow'r, all flow'rs excelling, Which in Eden's garden grew; Flow'rs of Eve's imbower'd dwelling Alluding to Milton's description of Eve's bower., Are, my Fair-one, types of you. Mark, my Polly, how the roses Emulate thy damask cheek; How the bud its sweets discloses, Buds thy opening bloom bespeak. Lilies are, by plain direction, Emblems of a double kind; Emblems of thy fair complexion, Emblems of thy fairer mind. But, dear girl, both flow'rs and beauty Blossom, fade, and die away; Then pursue good sense and duty, Evergreens, that ne'er decay. Father Francis's Prayer. Written in Lord Westmorland's Hermitage. Ne gay attire, ne marble hall, Ne arched roof, ne pictur'd wall; Ne cook of Fraunce, ne dainty board, Bestow'd with pypes of perigord; Ne power, ne such like idle fancies, Sweet Agnes grant to father Francis; Let me ne more myself deceive; Ne more regret the toys I leave; The world I quit, the proud, the vain, Corruption's and Ambition's train; But not the good, perdie nor fair, 'Gainst them I make ne vow, ne pray'r; But such aye welcome to my cell, And oft, not always, with me dwell; Then cast, sweet Saint, a circle round, And bless from fools this holy ground; From all the foes to worth and truth, From wanton old, and homely youth; The gravely dull, and pertly gay, Oh banish these; and by my fay, Right well I ween that in this age, Mine house shall prove an hermitage. An Inscription on the Cell. Beneath these moss-grown roots, this rustick cell, Truth, Liberty, Content, sequester'd dwell; Say you, who dare our hermitage disdain, What drawing-room can boast so fair a train? An Inscription in the Cell. Sweet bird that sing'st on yonder spray, Pursue unharm'd thy sylvan lay; While I beneath this breezy shade, In peace repose my careless head; And joining thy enraptur'd song, Instruct the world-enamour'd throng, That the contented harmless breast In solitude itself is blest. To the Right Hon. Henry Pelham, Esq The humble Petition of the worshipful company of Poets and News-writers, Sheweth, THAT your honour's petitioners (dealers in rhymes, And writers of scandal, for mending the times) By losses in bus'ness, and England's well-doing, Are sunk in their credit, and verging on ruin. That these, their misfortunes, they humbly conceive, Arise not from dulness, as some folks believe, But from rubs in their way, that your honour has laid, And want of materials to carry on trade. That they always had form'd high conceits of their use, And meant their last breath should go out in abuse; But now (and they speak it with sorrow and tears) Since your honour has sate at the helm of affairs, No party will join 'em, no faction invite To heed what they say, or to read what they write; Sedition, and Tumult, and Discord are fled, And Slander scarce ventures to lift up her head— In short, publick bus'ness is so carry'd on, That their country is sav'd, and the patriots undone. To perplex 'em still more, and sure famine to bring (Now satire has lost both its truth and its sting) If, in spite of their natures, they bungle at praise, Your honour regards not, and nobody pays. YOUR Petitioners therefore most humbly entreat (As times will allow, and your honour thinks meet) That measures be chang'd, and some cause of complaint Be immediately furnish'd, to end their restraint; Their credit thereby, and their trade to retrieve, That again they may rail, and the nation believe. Or else (if your wisdom shall deem it all one) Now the parliament's rising, and bus'ness is done, That your honour would please, at this dangerous crisis, To take to your bosom a few private vices, By which your petitioners, haply, might thrive, And keep both themselves and contention alive. In compassion, good Sir! give 'em something to say, And your honour's petitioners ever shall pray. An ODE Performed in the Senate-House at Cambridge July 1, 1749, At the Installation of his Grace Thomas Holles Duke of Newcastle, Chancellor of the University. By Mr. Mason, Fellow of Pembroke-Hall. Set to Musick by Mr. Boyce, Composer to his Majesty. ? canit errantem Permessi ad flumina Gallum Aonas in montes ut duxerit una sororum; Utque viro Phœbi chorus assurrexerit omnis. Virgil. [I.] Recitative. Here all thy active fires diffuse, Thou genuine British Muse; Hither descend from yonder orient sky, Cloth'd in thy heav'n-wove robe of harmony. Air I. Come, imperial queen of song; Come with all that free-born grace, Which lifts thee from the servile throng, Who meanly mimic thy majestic pace; That glance of dignity divine, Which speaks thee of celestial line; Proclaims thee inmate of the sky, Daughter of Jove and Liberty. II. Recitative. The elevated soul, who feels Thy aweful impulse, walks the fragrant ways Of honest unpolluted praise: He with impartial justice deals The blooming chaplets of immortal lays: He flies above ambition's low career; And nobly thron'd in Truth's meridian sphere, Thence, with a bold and heav'n-directed aim, Full on fair Virtue's shrine he pours the rays of fame. III. Air II. Goddess! thy piercing eye explores The radiant range of Beauty's stores, The steep ascent of pine-clad hills, The silver slope of falling rills, Catches each lively-colour'd grace, The crimson of the wood-nymph's face, The verdure of the velvet lawn, The purple in the eastern dawn, Or all those tints, which rang'd in vivid glow Mark the bold sweep of the celestial bow. IV. Recitative. But chief she lifts her tuneful transports high, When to her intellectual eye The mental beauties rise in moral dignity: The sacred zeal for Freedom's cause, That fires the glowing Patriot's breast; The honest pride that plumes the Hero's crest, When for his country's aid the steel he draws; Or that, the calm, yet active heat, With which mild Genius warms the Sage's heart, To lift fair Science to a loftier seat, Or stretch to ampler bounds the wide domain of art. Air III. These, the best blossoms of the virtuous mind, She culls with taste refin'd; From their ambrosial bloom With bee-like skill she draws the rich perfume, And blends the sweets they all convey, In the soft balm of her mellifluous lay. V. Recitative. Is there a clime, where all these beauties rise In one collected radiance to her eyes? Is there a plain, whose genial soil enhales Glory's invigorating gales, Her brightest beams where Emulation spreads, Her kindliest dews where Science sheds, Where every stream of Genius flows, Where ev'ry flower of Virtue glows? Thither the Muse exulting flies, There she loudly cries— Chorus I. All hail, all hail, Majestic Granta! hail thy aweful name, Dear to the Muse, to Liberty, to Fame. VI. Recitative. You too, illustrious Train, she greets Who first in these inspiring seats Caught the bright beams of that ætherial fire, Which now sublimely prompts you to aspire To deeds of noblest note: whether to shield Your country's liberties, your country's laws; Or in Religion's hallow'd cause To hurl the shafts of reason, and to wield Those heav'nly-temper'd arms, whose rapid force Arrests base Falshood in her impious course, And drives rebellious Vice indignant from the field. VII. Air IV. And now she tunes her plausive song To you her sage domestic throng; Who here, at Learning's richest shrine, Dispense to each ingenuous youth The treasures of immortal Truth, And open Wisdom's golden mine. Recitative. Each youth inspir'd by your persuasive art, Clasps the dear form of virtue to his heart; And feels in his transported soul Enthusiastic raptures roll, Gen'rous as those the sons of Cecrops caught In hoar Lycæum's shades from Plato's fire-clad thought. [VIII.] Air V. O Granta! on thy happy plain Still may these Attic glories reign: Still mayst thou keep thy wonted state, In unaffected grandeur great; Recitative. Great as this illustrious hour, When He, whom George's well-weigh'd choice And Albion's general voice Have lifted to the fairest heights of pow'r, When He appears, and deigns to shine The leader of thy learned line; And bids the verdure of thy olive bough 'Mid all his civic chaplets twine, And add fresh glories to his honour'd brow. IX. Air VI. Haste then, and amply o'er his head The graceful foliage spread; Mean while the Muse shall snatch the trump of Fame, And lift her swelling accents high, To tell the world that Pelham's name Is dear to Learning as to Liberty. Full Chorus. The Muse shall snatch the trump of Fame, And lift her swelling accents high, To tell the world that Pelham's name Is dear to Learning as to Liberty. ODE to an ÆOLUS's This instrument appears to have been invented by Kircher: who has given a very accurate description of it in his Musurgia. After having been neglected above an hundred years, it was again accidentally discovered by Mr. Oswald. See Vol. III. p. 4. of this Miscellany. Harp. Sent to Miss SHEPHEARD. By the Same. Yes, magic lyre! now all compleat Thy slender frame responsive rings, While kindred notes with undulation sweet Accordant wake from all thy vocal strings. Go then to her, whose soft request Bade my blest hands thy form prepare; Ah go, and sweetly sooth her tender breast With many a warble wild, and artless air. For know, full oft, while o'er the mead Bright June extends her fragrant reign, The Fair shall place thee near her slumb'ring head To court the gales that cool the sultry plain; Then shall the Sylphs, and Sylphids bright, Mild Genii all, to whose high care Her virgin charms are giv'n, in circling flight Skim sportive round thee in the fields of air. Some, flutt'ring 'mid thy trembling strings, Shall catch the rich melodious spoil, And lightly brush thee with their purple wings To aid the zephyrs in their tuneful toil; While others check each ruder gale, Expel rough Boreas from the sky, Nor let a breeze its heaving breath exhale, Save such as softly pant, and panting die. Then, as thy swelling accents rise, Fair Fancy waking at the sound, Shall paint bright visions on her raptur'd eyes, And waft her spirits to enchanted ground, To myrtle groves, Elysian greens, 'Mid which some fav'rite youth shall rove, Shall meet, shall lead her thro' the glitt'ring scenes, And all be music, extacy, and love. ODE to HEALTH. By Mr. Duncombe, Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Non est vivere, sed valere, vita. Martial. I Health! to thee thy vot'ry owes All the blessings life bestows, All the sweets the summer yields, Melodious woods, and clover'd fields; By thee he tastes the calm delights Of studious days and peaceful nights: By thee his eye each scene with rapture views; The Muse shall sing thy gifts, for they inspire the Muse. II Does increase of wealth impart Transports to a bounteous heart? Does the sire with smiles survey His prattling children round him play? Does love with mutual blushes streak The swain's and virgin's artless cheek? From Health these blushes, smiles and transports flow; Wealth, children, love itself, to Health their relish owe. III Nymph! with thee, at early Morn, Let me brush the waving corn; And, at Noon-tide's sultry hour, O bear me to the wood-bine bow'r! When Evening lights her glow-worm, lead To yonder dew-enamell'd mead; And let me range at Night those glimm'ring groves, Where stillness ever sleeps, and Contemplation roves. IV This my tributary lay, Grateful at thy shrine I pay, Who for sev'n whole years hast shed Thy balmy blessings o'er my head; O! let me still enamour'd view Those fragrant lips of rosy hue, Nor think there needs th'allay of sharp disease, To quicken thy repast, and give it pow'r to please. V Now by swiftest Zephyrs drawn, Urge thy chariot o'er the lawn; In yon gloomy grotto laid, Author of Clarissa. Palemon asks thy kindly aid; If goodness can that aid engage, O hover round the virtuous sage: Nor let one sigh for his own suff'rings rise; Each human suff'ring fills his sympathizing eyes. VI Venus from Æneas' side With successful efforts try'd To extract th'envenom'd dart, That baffled wise Iapis' art, If thus, Hygeia, thou couldst prove Propitious to the queen of love, Now on thy favour'd Heberden bestow Thy choicest healing pow'rs, for Pallas asks them now. VII What tho', banish'd from the fight, To the hero's troubled sight, Ranks on ranks tumultuous rose Of flying friends and conqu'ring foes; He only panted to obtain A laurel wreath for thousands slain; On nobler views intent, the Sage's mind Pants to delight, instruct, and humanise mankind. A VERNAL ODE. Sent to his Grace the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, March 12, 1754. By FRANCIS FAWKES, A. M. I Bright God of day, whose genial power Revives the buried seed, That spreads with foliage every bower, With verdure every mead, Bid all thy vernal breezes fly, Diffusing mildness thro' the sky; Give the soft season to our drooping plains, Sprinkled with rosy dews, and salutary rains. II Enough has Winter's hand severe Hurl'd all his terrors round, Chill'd the fair dawning of the year, And whiten'd all the ground: Give but thy vital beams to play, The frozen scenes will melt away; And, mix in sprightly dance, the blooming Hours Will 'wake the drowsy Spring, and Spring awake the flowers. III Let Health, gay daughter of the skies, On Zephyr's wings descend, And scatter pleasures as she flies Where Surry's downs extend; There Herring wooes her friendly power, There may she all her roses shower, To heal that shepherd all her balms employ, So will she sooth our fears, and give a nation joy. IV Ah me! that Virtue's godlike friends So soon are claim'd by Fate! Lo! The Right Honourable Henry Pelham, Esq; died on the 6th of March 1754. Pelham to the grave descends, The bulwark of the state: When will fair Truth his equal find Among the best of human kind? Long be the fatal day with mourning kept! Augustus sigh'd sincere, and all the worthy wept. V Thy delegate, kind heaven, restore To health, and safely keep; Let good Augustus sigh no more, No more the worthy weep: And still upon the royal head The riches of thy blessings shed: Establish'd with his counsellors around, Long be his prosp'rous reign, and all with glory crown'd. An AUTUMNAL ODE. By the Same. I Yet once more, glorious God of day, While beams thine orb serene, O let me warbling court thy stay To gild the fading scene! Thy rays invigorate the Spring, Bright Summer to perfection bring, The cold, inclement days of Winter cheer, And make th'Autumnal months the mildest of the year. II Ere yet the russet foliage fall, I'll climb the mountain's brow, My friend, my Hayman, at thy call, To view the scene below: How sweetly pleasing to behold Forests of vegetable gold! How mix'd the many-chequer'd shades between The tawny mellowing hue, and the gay vivid green! III How splendid all the sky! how still! How mild the dying gale! How soft the whispers of the rill That winds along the dale! So tranquil Nature's works appear, It seems the Sabbath of the year; As if, the Summer's Labour past, she chose This season's sober calm for blandishing repose. IV Such is of well-spent life the time, When busy days are past, Man verging gradual from his prime, Meets sacred Peace at last: His flowery Spring of pleasures o'er, And Summer's full-blown pride no more, He gains pacific Autumn, meek and bland, And dauntless braves the stroke of Winter's palsy'd hand. V For yet awhile, a little while, Involv'd in wint'ry gloom, And lo! another Spring shall smile, A Spring eternal bloom; Then shall he shine, a glorious guest, In the bright mansions of the blest, Where due rewards on Virtue are bestow'd, And reap the golden fruits of what his Autumn sow'd. A SONG. [Away, let nought to love displeasing] I Away, let nought to love displeasing My Winifreda, move thy fear, Let nought delay the heav'nly blessing, Nor squeamish pride, nor gloomy care. II What tho' no grants of royal donors With pompous titles grace our blood, We'll shine in more substantial honours, And to be noble we'll be good. III What tho' from Fortune's lavish bounty No mighty treasures we possess, We'll find within our pittance plenty, And be content without excess. IV Still shall each kind returning season Sufficient for our wishes give, For we will live a life of reason, And that's the only life to live. V Our name, whilst virtue thus we tender, Shall sweetly sound where'er 'tis spoke, And all the great ones much shall wonder, How they admire such little folk. VI Thro' youth and age in love excelling, We'll hand in hand together tread, Sweet smiling Peace shall crown our dwelling, And babes, sweet smiling babes, our bed. VII How should I love the pretty creatures, Whilst round my knees they fondly clung, To see 'em look their mother's features, To hear 'em lisp their mother's tongue. VIII And when with envy Time transported Shall think to rob us of our joys, You'll in your girls again be courted, And I go wooing in my boys. The GENIUS. An ODE, written in 1717, on occasion of the Duke of Marlborough's Apoplexy. I Aweful here, Marlb'rough, rise: Sleepy charms I come to break: Higher turn thy languid eyes: Lo! thy Genius calls: awake! II Well survey this faithful plan, With records thy life's great story; 'Tis a short, but crowded span, Full of triumphs, full of glory. III One by one thy deeds review, Sieges, battles, thick appear; Former wonders, lost in new, Greatly fill each pompous year. IV This is Blenheim's crimson field, Wet with gore, with slaughter stain'd! Here retiring squadrons yield, And a bloodless wreath is gain'd! V Ponder in thy godlike mind All the wonders thou hast wrought; Tyrants, from their pride declin'd, Be the subject of thy thought! VI Rest thee here, while life may last: Th'utmost bliss, to man allow'd, Is to trace his actions past, And to own them great and good. VII But 'tis gone—a mortal born! Swift the fading scenes remove— Let them pass with noble scorn, Thine are worlds, which roll above. VIII Poets, prophets, heroes, kings, Pleas'd, thy ripe approach foresee; Men, who acted wond'rous things, Tho' they yield in fame to thee. IX Foremost, in the patriot-band, Shining with distinguish'd day, See thy friend, Godolphin stand! See! he beckons thee away. X Yonder seats and fields of light Let thy ravish'd thought explore; Wishing, panting for thy flight! Half an angel; man no more. Translations from Horace. By Mr. Marriott, of Trinity-Hall, Cambridge. Book I. Ode XVIII. Invitation to his Mistress. Oft Faunus leaves Arcadia's plain, And to the Sabine hill retreats: He guards my flocks from rushing rain, From piercing winds, and scorching heats. Where lurks the thyme, or shrubs appear, My wanton kids securely play; My goats no pois'nous serpent fear, Safe wand'ring thro' the woodland way. No hostile wolf the fold invades; Ustica's pendent rocks rebound My song; and all the sylvan shades, By Echo taught, return the sound. The gods my verse propitious hear, My head from every danger shield: For you, o'erflows the bounteous year, And Plenty's horn hath heap'd my field. Responsive to the Teian string, Within the sun-defended vale, Here, softly warbling you shall sing Each tender, tuneful, am'rous tale. No rival, here, shall burst the bands That wreathe my charmer's beauteous hair, Nor seize her weakly struggling hands; But Love and Horace guard the fair. Ode VI. Book II. Imitated. Bevil, that with your friend would roam, Far from your England's happier home, Should e'er the Fates that friend detain In gayer France, or graver Spain; Know, all my wish is to retreat, When age shall quench my youthful heat, In Kentish shades sweet peace to find, And leave the sons of care behind. But should this pleasing hope be vain, May I fair Windsor's seat attain, Where Leddon's gentle waters glide, And flocks adorn its flowery side. Sweet groves, I love your silent shades: Your russet lawns, and op'ning glades, With fam'd Italia's plains may vie Your fertile fields, and healthful sky. Here, let our eve of life be spent; Here, friend shall live with friend content: Here, in cold earth my limbs be laid; And here thy generous tear be paid. Book II. Ode XII. Translated. The wars of Numantia and Hannibal dire, On land, or on ocean the fighting, Mæcenas, ne'er suited my peaceable lyre, In subjects much softer delighting. You love not of centaurs embattled to hear, Nor of giants, a tale of such wonder, Who shook all the skies, made Jupiter fear, 'Till drove by Alcides and thunder. In prose, my good patron, more nobly you write, As your topic than these is much better, How Cæsar with glory can govern and fight, And lead haughty kings in his fetter. Alone my gay Muse of Licinnia would sing, The constant, good-natur'd, and pretty, So graceful to dance with the maids in a ring, So sparkling, so merry, and witty. While you play with her hair that is carelessly curl'd, While this way, now that way she twitches, Of your teazing so kindly complaining, no world Could bribe for one lock with its riches. Thus blest with the nymph, how transporting the joy! Who whimsical, wanton, amuses; Who pleasingly forward, or prettily coy, Oft snatches the kiss she refuses. To a LADY making a Pin-Basket. By the same. While objects of a parent's care, With joy your fond attention share, Madam, accept th'auspicious strain; Nor rise your beauteous work in vain. Oft be your second race survey'd, And oft a new pin-basket made. When marriage was in all its glory, So poets, madam, tell the story, Ere Plutus damp'd love's purer flame, Or Smithfield bargains had a name, In heav'n a blooming youth and bride At Hymen's altars were ally'd; When Cupid had his Psyché won, And, all her destin'd labours done, The cruel Fates their rage relented, And mamma Venus had consented. At Jove's command, and Hermes' call, The train appear'd to fill the hall, And gods, and goddesses were drest, To do them honour, in their best. The little rogues now pass'd the row, And look'd, and mov'd I don't know how, And, ambling hand in hand, appear Before the mighty thunderer. Low at his throne they bent the knee; He smil'd the blushing pair to see, Lay'd his tremendous bolt aside, And strok'd their cheeks, and kiss'd the bride. Says Juno, since our Jove's so kind, My dears, some present I must find, In greatest pleasures, greatest dangers, We and the sex were never strangers; With bounteous hand my gifts I spread, Presiding o'er the marriage-bed. Soon, for the months are on the wing, To you a daughter fair I bring, And know, from this your nuptial morn Shall Pleasure, smiling babe, be born. But for the babe we must prepare; That too shall be your Juno's care. Apollo from his golden lyre, Shall first assist us with the wire; Vulcan shall make the silver pin. The basket thus we shall begin, Where we may put the child's array, And get it ready by the day. The nymphs themselves with flowers shall dress it, Pallas shall weave, and I will bless it. Captain CUPID. By the Same. Erst, in Cythera's sacred shade, When Venus clasp'd the god of war, The laughing loves around them play'd, One bore the shield, and one the spear. The little warriors Cupid led, The shining baldric grac'd his breast, The mighty helmet o'er his head Nodded its formidable crest. Hence oft', to win some stubborn maid, Still does the wanton God assume The martial air, the gay cockade, The sword, the shoulder-knot and plume. Phyllis had long his power defy'd, Resolv'd her conquests to maintain; His fruitless art each poet try'd: Each shepherd tun'd his pipe in vain. 'Till Cupid came, a captain bold: Of trenches and of palisadoes He talk'd; and many a tale he told Of battles, and of ambuscadoes. How oft' his godship had been drunk; What melting maids he had undone; How oft' by night had storm'd a punk, Or bravely beat a saucy dun. He swore, drank, whor'd, sung, danc'd with spirit, And o'er each pleasing topic ran; 'Till Phyllis sigh'd, and own'd his merit, The Captain's sure a charming man. Ye bards, on verse let Phœbus doat, Ye shepherds, leave your pipes to Pan, Nor verse nor pipe will Phyllis note. The Captain is the charming man. ODE on Ambition. By the Same. The mariner, when first he sails, While his bold oars the sparkling surface sweep, With new delight, transported hails The blue expanded skies, and level deep. Such young Ambition's fearless aim, Pleas'd with the gorgeous scene of wealth and power, In the gay morn of early fame, Nor thinks of evening storm, and gloomy hour. Life's opening views bright charms reveal, Feed the fond wish, and fan the youthful fire. But woes unknown those charms conceal, And fair illusions cheat our fierce desire. There Envy shows her sullen mien, With changeful colour, grinning smiles of hate: There Malice stabs, with rage serene; In deadly silence, treacherous Friendships wait. High on a mountain's lofty brow, 'Mid clouds and storms, has Glory fix'd her seat; Rock'd by the roaring winds that blow, The lightnings blast it, and the tempests beat. Within the sun-gilt vale beneath, More moderate Hope with sweet Contentment dwells, While gentler breezes round them breathe, And softer showers refresh their peaceful cells. To better genius ever blind, That points to each in varied life his share, Man quits the path by heaven design'd, To search for bliss among the thorns of care. Our native powers we scorn to know; With stedfast error still the wrong pursue; Instruct our forward ills to grow; While sad successes but our pain renew. In vain heaven tempers life with sweet, With flowers the way, that leads us home, bestrews, If dupes to passion, and deceit, We drink the bitter, and the rugged chuse. Few can on Grandeur's stage appear, Each lofty part with true applause sustain, No common virtue safe can steer, Where rocks unnumber'd lurk beneath the main. Then happiest he, whose timely hand To cool Discretion has the helm resign'd; Enjoys the calm, in sight of land, From changing tides secure, and trustless wind. ODE to FANCY. By the Same. I Gilding with brighter beams the vernal skies, Now hastes the car of day to rise. Youth, and Mirth, and Beauty leads In golden reins the sprightly steeds, With wanton Love that rolls his sparkling eyes. Morpheus, no more Thy poppies, cropt on Lethe's margin, shed Around thy languid poet's head. Thou drowsy god, 'Tis time to break thy leaden rod, And give thy slumbers o'er. But come, thou woodland Nymph, along, Mistress of the vocal song, Fancy ever fair and free; Whether on the mountains straying, Or on beds of roses playing, Daughter of sweet Liberty. II. Through all the ivy-circled cave Soft music at thy birth was heard to sound. The graces danc'd thy bower around, And gently dipt thee in the silver wave. With blossoms fair thy cradle drest, And rock'd their smiling babe to rest. To kiss thy lips, the bees, a murmuring throng, With busy wings, unnumber'd flew; For thee, from every flower their tribute drew, And lull'd thy slumbers with an airy song. Come in thy heav'nly woven vest, That Iris' hand has ting'd in every dye, With which she paints the sky, Flowing o'er thy zoneless breast. III. Me, sweet enchantress, deign to bear O'er the seas, and thro' the air; O'er the plains extended wide, O'er misty hills, and curling clouds we ride, Now mounting high, now sinking low, Thro' hail and rain, and vapours go; Where is treasur'd up the snow: Where sleeps the thunder in its cell; Where the swift-wing'd light'nings dwell; Or where the blust'ring storms are taught to blow. Now tread the milky way; Unnumber'd worlds that float in æther spy, Among the glittering planets stray, To the lunar orbit fly, And mountains, shores, and seas descry. Now catch the music of the spheres; Which, since the birth of time, Have, in according chime, And fair proportion, rolling round, With each diviner sound Attentive Silence, pierc'd thy list'ning ears; Unheard by all, but those alone Whom to wisdom's secret throne The Muse, with heav'n-taught guidance, deigns to bring, To trace the sacred paths with hallowed feet; Or, Fancy, who the mystic shade, In thy airy car, pervade, Where Plato's raptur'd spirit holds its solemn seat. IV. But, Fancy, downward urge thy flight. On some mountain's towering height, With hoary frosts eternal crown'd, Rapt with dusky vapours round, Let me fix my stedfast feet. I feel, I feel the fanning gales; The wat'ry mists beneath retreat. The noontide ray now darts its heat, And pours its glories o'er the vales. Glittering to the dancing beams, Urging their stubborn way the rocks among, I hear, and see a thousand streams Foam, and roar, and rush along. But to the plains descended, Their sudden rage is ended. Now lost in deep recess of darksome bowers, Again now sparkling thro' the meads Vested soft with vernal flowers, Reflecting the majestic towers, Its peaceful flood the roving channel leads. There the rural cots are seen. From whose low roof the curling smoke ascends, And dims with blueish volumes all the green. There some forest far extends Its groves embrown'd with lengthen'd shade; Embosom'd where some Gothic seat, Of monarchs once retreat; In wild magnificence array'd, The pride of ancient times presents, And lifts, in contrast fair display'd, Its sun-reflecting battlements. V. Near, some imperial city seems to reign, Triumphant o'er the subject land; With domes of art Vitruvian crown'd. See gleam her gilded spires around, Her gates in aweful grandeur stand. Equal to shine in peace, or war sustain; Her mighty bulwarks threat the plain With many a work of death, and armed mound. Where rolls her wealthy river deep and wide, Tall groves of crowded masts arise; Their streamers waving to the skies, The banks are white with swelling sails, And distant vessels stem the tide, Circling thro' pendant cliffs, and watery dales. The russet hills, the valleys green beneath, The sallows brown, and dusky heath, The yellow corn, empurpled vine, In union soft their tints combine, And, Fancy, all engage thine eye With a sweet variety. While clouds the fleeting clouds pursue, In mutual shade, and mutual light, The changing landscape meets the sight; 'Till the ken no more can view; And heaven appears to meet the ground; The rising lands, and azure distance drown'd Amid the gay horizon's golden bound. VI. Such are the scenes that oft invite To feed thee, Fancy, with delight. All that nature can create, Beauteous, aweful, new and great, Sweet enthusiast, is thy treasure, Source of wonder, and of pleasure; Every sense to transport winning, Still unbounded and beginning. Then, Fancy, spread thy wings again; Unlock the caverns of the main. Above, beneath, and all around: Let the tumbling billows spread; 'Till the coral floor we tread, Exploring all the wealth that decks the realms profound; There, gather gems that long have glow'd In the vast, unknown abode, The jasper vein'd, the saphire blue, The ruby bright with crimson hue, Whate'er the bed resplendent paves, Or decks the glittering roofs on high, Thro' whose translucent arch are seen the rolling waves. Fancy, these shall clasp thy vest, With these thy lovely brows be drest, In every gay, and various dye. But hark!—the seas begin to roar, The whistling winds assault my ear, The lou'ring storms around appear— Fancy, bear me to the shore. There in thy realms, bright goddess, deign Secure to fix thy votary's feet: O give to follow oft thy train: Still with accustom'd lay thy power to greet; To dwell with Peace, and sport with thee, Fancy, ever fair and free. An Address to his Elbow-chair, new cloath'd. By the late Wm. Somervile, Esq; Author of the Chace. Written towards the close of Mr. Somervile's life. My dear companion, and my faithful friend! If Orpheus taught the listening oaks to bend; If stones and rubbish, at Amphion's call, Danc'd into form, and built the Theban wall; Why should'st not thou attend my humble lays, And hear my grateful harp resound thy praise? True, thou art spruce and fine, a very beau; But what are trappings, and external show? To real worth alone I make my court; Knaves are my scorn, and coxcombs are my sport. Once I beheld thee far less trim and gay; Ragged, disjointed, and to worms a prey; The safe retreat of every lurking mouse; Derided, shun'd; the lumber of my house! Thy robe, how chang'd from what it was before! Thy velvet robe, which pleas'd my sires of yore! Tis thus capricious Fortune wheels us round; Aloft we mount—then tumble to the ground. Yet grateful then, my constancy I prov'd; I knew thy worth; my friend in rags I lov'd! I lov'd thee, more; nor like a courtier, spurn'd My benefactor, when the tide was turn'd. With conscious shame, yet frankly, I confess, That in my youthful days—I lov'd thee less. Where vanity, where pleasure call'd, I stray'd; And every wayward appetite obey'd. But sage experience taught me how to prize Myself; and how, this world: she bade me rise To nobler flights, regardless of a race Of factious emmets; pointed where to place My bliss, and lodg'd me in thy soft embrace. Here on thy yielding down I sit secure; And, patiently, what heav'n has sent, endure; From all the futile cares of business free; Not fond of life, but yet content to be: Here mark the fleeting hours; regret the past; And seriously prepare, to meet the last. So safe on shore the pension'd sailor lies; And all the malice of the storm defies: With ease of body blest, and peace of mind, Pities the restless crew he left behind; Whilst, in his cell, he meditates alone On his great voyage, to the world unknown. SONG. By the Same. [As o'er Asteria's fields I rove] [I.] As o'er Asteria's fields I rove, The blissful seat of peace and love, Ten thousand beauties round me rise, And mingle pleasure with surprize. By nature blest in every part, Adorn'd with every grace of art, This paradise of blooming joys Each raptur'd sense, at once, employs. II. But when I view the radiant queen, Who form'd this fair enchanting scene; Pardon ye grots! ye crystal floods! Ye breathing flow'rs! ye shady woods! Your coolness now no more invites; No more your murmuring stream delights; Your sweets decay, your verdure's flown; My soul's intent on her alone. ODE to a Friend wounded in a Duel. How long shall tyrant Custom bind In slavish chains the human mind? How long shall false fantastic Honour draw The vengeful sword, with fury fell, And ranc'rous Malice dark as hell, In spight of Reason's rule, and Nature's eldest law? Too many gallant youths have bled; Too much of British blood been shed By Britons' swords, and that foul monster's laws: Youths that might else have nobly dar'd; More glorious wounds and dangers shar'd For Britain's just defence, and virtue's injur'd cause. So when the fierce Cadmean youth Sprung from the dragon's venom'd tooth, Each chief arose in shining armour drest: With rage inspir'd, the furious band Soon found a ready foe at hand, And plung'd the pointed steel each in a brother's breast. Has Britain then no other foes, That thus her sons their lives expose To private war, and feuds, and civil fray? Does Spain insult her flag no more? Does Lewis yet his thoughts give o'er Of universal rule, and arbitrary sway? 'Tis Britons' to support the law; 'Tis theirs ambitious kings to awe, And equal rights of empire to maintain. For this our fathers, brave and stout, At Agincourt and Cressy fought, And heap'd fam'd Blenheim's field with mountains of the slain. How will the Gallic monarch smile, To see the sons of Albion's isle Their country's blood with ruthless weapons drain! Themselves avenge the glorious day When Marlb'rough swept whole hosts away, And sent the frighted Danube purple to the main! O say, in this inglorious strife Thy arm had robb'd thy friend of life, What pangs, what anguish had thy bosom prov'd? How hadst thou curs'd the cruel deed, That caus'd the gallant youth to bleed, Pierc'd by thy guilty sword, and slain by him he lov'd? How did the fair Maria blame Thy high-bred spirit's eager flame, That courting danger slighted her soft love? Far other wreaths for thee she twin'd; Far other cares for thee design'd; And for the laurel crown, the myrtle chaplet wove. If not for her's, for Britain's sake, Forbear thy precious life to stake; Nor taint thy honour with so foul a deed. One day thy country may require Thy gallant arm and martial fire: Then may'st thou bravely conquer, or as bravely bleed. ODE to NIGHT. The busy cares of day are done; In yonder western cloud the sun Now sets, in other worlds to rise, And glad with night the nether skies. With ling'ring pace the parting day retires, And slowly leaves the mountain tops, and gilded spires. Yon azure cloud, enrob'd with white, Still shoots a gleam of fainter light: At length descends a browner shade; At length the glimm'ring objects fade: 'Till all submit to Night's impartial reign, And undistinguish'd darkness covers all the plain. No more the ivy-crowned oak Resounds beneath the wood-man's stroke. Now Silence holds her solemn sway; Mute is each bush, and ev'ry spray: Nought but the sound of murm'ring rills is heard, Or from the mould'ring tow'r, Night's solitary bird. Hail sacred hour of peaceful rest! Of pow'r to charm the troubled breast! By thee the captive slave obtains Short respite from his galling pains; Nor sighs for liberty, nor native soil; But for a while forgets his chains, and sultry toil. No horrors hast thou in thy train, No scorpion lash, no clanking chain. When the pale murd'rer round him spies A thousand grisly forms arise, When shrieks and groans arouse his palsy'd fear, 'Tis guilt alarms his soul, and conscience wounds his ear. The village swain whom Phillis charms, Whose breast the tender passion warms, Wishes for thy all-shadowing veil, To tell the fair his love-sick tale: Nor less impatient of the tedious day, She longs to hear his tale, and sigh her soul away. Oft by the covert of thy shade Leander woo'd the Thracian maid; Thro' foaming seas his passion bore, Nor fear'd the ocean's thund'ring roar. The conscious virgin from the sea-girt tow'r Hung out the faithful torch to guide him to her bow'r. Oft at thy silent hour the sage Pores on the fair instructive page; Or rapt in musings deep, his soul Mounts active to the starry pole: There pleas'd to range the realms of endless night, Numbers the stars, or marks the comet's devious light. Thine is the hour of converse sweet, When sprightly wit and reason meet: Wit, the fair blossom of the mind, But fairer still with reason join'd. Such is the feast thy social hours afford, When eloquence and Granville join the friendly board. Granville, whose polish'd mind is fraught With all that Rome or Greece e'er taught; Who pleases and instructs the ear, When he assumes the critic's chair, Or from the Stagyrite or Plato draws The arts of civil life, the spirit of the laws. O let me often thus employ The hour of mirth and social joy! And glean from Granville's learned store Fair science and true wisdom's lore. Then will I still implore thy longer stay, Nor change thy festive hours for sunshine and the day. Written upon leaving a Friend's House in Wales. By the Rev. Dr. M. The winds were loud, the clouds deep-hung; And dragg'd their sweepy trains along The dreary mountain's side; When, from the hill, one look to throw On Towy's rambling flood below, I turn'd my horse—and sigh'd. But soon the gusts of sleet and hail Flew thick across the darken'd vale, And blurr'd the face of day: Forlorn and sad, I jogg'd along; And tho' Tom cry'd, “You're going wrong,” Still wander'd from my way. The scenes, which once my fancy took, And my aw'd mind with wonder struck, Pass'd unregarded, all! Nor black Trecarris' steepy height, Nor waste Trecastle gave delight; Nor clamorous Hondy's fall. Did the bleak day then give me pain? The driving snow, or pelting rain, Or sky with tempests fraught? No! these unheeded rag'd around: Nought in them so much Mine I found, As claim'd one wandering thought. Far other cares engross'd my mind, Cares for the joys I left behind, In Newton is the name of a seat belonging to Sir John Price. Newton's happy groves! Yet not because its woods disclose Or grots or lawns more sweet than those Which Pan at noon-day loves; But that, beside its social hearth Dwells every joy, which youthful mirth Or serious age can claim: The man too whom my soul first knew, To virtue and to honour true; And friendship's sacred name. O Newton, could these pensive lays In worthy numbers scan thy praise, Much gratitude would say; But that the Muse, ingenuous maid, Of flattery seems so much afraid, She'll scarce her duty pay. Brecknock, Oct. 16, 1749. DENNIS to Mr. THOMSON, Who had procured him a Benefit Night. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Reflecting on thy worth, methinks I find Thy various Seasons in their author's mind. Spring opes her blossoms, various as thy Muse, And, like thy soft compassion, sheds her dews. Summer's hot drought in thy expression glows, And o'er each page a tawny ripeness throws. Autumn's rich fruits th'instructed reader gains, Who tastes the meaning purpose of thy strains. Winter—but that no semblance takes from thee: That hoary season yields a type of me. Shatter'd by time's bleak storms I withering lay, Leafless, and whitening in a cold decay! Yet shall my propless ivy, pale and bent, Bless the short sunshine which thy pity lent. SONG. 1753. I How easy was Colin, how blithe and how gay! Ere he met the fair Chloris, how sprightly his lay! So graceful her form, so accomplish'd her mind, Sure pity, he thought, with such charms must be join'd! II Whenever she danc'd, or whenever she sung, How just was her motion, how sweet was her tongue! And when the youth told her his passionate flame, She allow'd him to fancy her heart felt the same. III With ardour he press'd her to think him sincere, But alas! she redoubled each hope and each fear; She would not deny, nor she would not approve, And she neither refus'd him, nor gave him her love. IV Now cheer'd by complacence, now froze by disdain, He languish'd for freedom, but languish'd in vain: 'Till Thyrsis, who pity'd so helpless a slave, Eas'd his heart of its pain by the counsel he gave. V Forsake her, said he, and reject her awhile; If she love you, she soon will return with a smile: You can judge of her passion by absence alone, And by absence will conquer her heart or—your own. VI This advice he pursu'd; but the remedy prov'd Too fatal, alas, to the fair one he lov'd; Which cur'd his own passion, but left her in vain To sigh for a heart she could never regain. I. S. H. The BULFINCH in Town. By a Lady of Quality. Hark to the blackbird's pleasing note: Sweet usher of the vocal throng! Nature directs his warbling throat, And all that hear, admire the song. Yon' bulfinch, with unvary'd tone, Of cadence harsh, and accent shrill, Has brighter plumage to attone For want of harmony and skill. Yet, discontent with nature's boon, Like man, to mimick art he flies; On opera-pinions hoping soon Unrival'd he shall mount the skies. And while, to please some courtly fair, He one dull tune with labour learns, A well-gilt cage remote from air, And faded plumes, is all he earns! Go, hapless captive! still repeat The sounds which nature never taught; Go, listening fair! and call them sweet, Because you know them dearly bought. Unenvy'd both! go hear and sing Your study'd musick o'er and o'er; Whilst I attend th'inviting spring, In fields where birds unfetter'd soar. SONG. Written in Winter 1745. By the Same. I The sun, his gladsome beams withdrawn, The hills all white with snow, Leave me dejected and forlorn! Who can describe my woe? But not the sun's warm beams could cheer, Nor hills, tho' e'er so green, Unless my Damon should appear, To beautify the scene. II The frozen brooks and pathless vales, Disjoin my love and me! The pining bird his fate bewails On yonder leafless tree! But what to me are birds or brooks Or any joy that's near? Heavy the lute, and dull the books, While Damon is not here! III The Laplander, who, half the year, Is wrapt in shades of night, Mourns not, like me, his winter drear; Nor wishes more for light. But what were light without my love, Or objects e'er so fine? The flowery meadow, field, or grove, If Damon be not mine? IV Each moment, from my dear away, Is a long age of pain; Fly swift, ye hours, be calm the day, That brings my love again! O haste and bring him to my arms; Nor let us ever part: My breast shall beat no more alarms, When I secure his heart. Written to a near Neighbour in a tempestuous Night, 1748. By the Same. I You bid my Muse not cease to sing, You bid my ink not cease to flow; Then say it ever shall be spring, And boisterous winds shall never blow: When you such miracles can prove, I'll sing of friendship, or of love. II But now, alone, by storms opprest, Which harshly in my ears resound; No cheerful voice with witty jest, No jocund pipe to still the sound; Untrain'd beside in verse-like art, How shall my pen express my heart? III In vain I call th'harmonious Nine, In vain implore Apollo's aid; Obdurate, they refuse a line, While spleen and care my rest invade, Say, shall we Morpheus next implore, And try if dreams befriend us more? IV Wisely at least he'll stop my pen, And with his poppies crown my brow: Better by far in lonesome den To sleep unheard of—than to glow With treach'rous wildfire of the brain, Th'intoxicated poet's bane. Written at a Ferme Ornee near Birmingham; August 7th, 1749. By the Same. 'Tis Nature here bids pleasing scenes arise, And wisely gives them Cynthio, to revise: To veil each blemish; brighten every grace; Yet still preserve the lovely Parent's face. How well the bard obeys, each valley tells; These lucid streams, gay meads, and lonely cells; Where modest art in silence lurks conceal'd: While Nature shines, so gracefully reveal'd, That she triumphant claims the total plan; And, with fresh pride, adopts the work of man. The GOLDFINCHES. An Elegy. By Mr. Jago. ? Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros. To you, whose groves protect the feather'd quires, Who lend their artless notes a willing ear, To you, whom pity moves, and taste inspires, The Doric strain belongs; O Shenstone, hear. 'Twas gentle spring, when all the tuneful race, By nature taught, in nuptial leagues combine: A goldfinch joy'd to meet the warm embrace, And hearts and fortunes with her mate to join. Thro' Nature's spacious walks at large they rang'd, No settled haunts, no fix'd abode their aim; As chance or fancy led, their path they chang'd, Themselves in every vary'd scene, the same. 'Till on a day to weighty cares resign'd, With mutual choice, alternate, they agreed, On rambling thoughts no more to turn their mind, But settle soberly, and raise a breed. All in a garden, on a currant-bush, With wond'rous art they built their waving seat: In the next orchat liv'd a friendly thrush, Nor distant far, a woodlark's soft retreat. Here blest with ease, and in each other blest, With early songs they wak'd the sprightly groves, 'Till time matur'd their bliss, and crown'd their nest With infant pledges of their faithful loves. And now what transport glow'd in either's eye! What equal fondness dealt th'allotted food! What joy each other's likeness to descry, And future sonnets in the chirping brood! But ah! what earthly happiness can last? How does the fairest purpose often fail? A truant-school-boy's wantonness could blast Their rising hopes, and leave them both to wail. The most ungentle of his tribe was he; No gen'rous precept ever touch'd his heart: With concords false, and hideous prosody He scrawl'd his task, and blunder'd o'er his part. On barb'rous plunder bent, with savage eye He mark'd where wrapt in down the younglins lay, Then rushing seiz'd the wretched family, And bore them in his impious hands away. But how shall I relate in numbers rude The pangs for poor Chrysomitris, it seems, is the name for a goldfinch. Chrysomitris decreed! When from a neighb'ring spray aghast she view'd The savage ruffian's inauspicious deed! So wrapt in grief some heart-struck matron stands, While horrid flames surround her children's room! On heav'n she calls, and wrings her trembling hands, Constrain'd to see, but not prevent their doom. “O grief of griefs! with shrieking voice she cry'd, “What sight is this that I have liv'd to see? “O! that I had a maiden-goldfinch died, “From love's false joys, and bitter sorrows free! “Was it for this, alas! with weary bill, “Was it for this, I pois'd th'unwieldy straw? “For this I pick'd the moss from yonder hill? “Nor shun'd the pond'rous chat along to draw? “Was it for this, I cull'd the wool with care; “And strove with all my skill our work to crown? “For this, with pain I bent the stubborn hair; “And lin'd our cradle with the thistle's down? “Was it for this my freedom I resign'd; “And ceas'd to rove from beauteous plain to plain? “For this I sate at home whole days confin'd, “And bore the scorching heat, and pealing rain? “Was it for this, my watchful eyes grow dim? “The crimson roses on my cheek turn pale? Pale is my golden plumage, once so trim; “And all my wonted spirits 'gin to fail. ‘O plund'rer vile! O more than weezel fell! “More treach'rous than the cat with prudish face! “More fierce than kites with whom the furies dwell! “More pilf'ring than the cuckow's prowling race! “For thee may plumb or goosb'ry never grow, “No juicy currant cool thy clammy throat: “But bloody birch-twigs work thee shameful woe, “Nor ever goldfinch cheer thee with her note.” Thus sang the mournful bird her piteous tale, The piteous tale her mournful mate return'd: Then side by side they sought the distant vale, And there in silent sadness inly mourn'd. The BLACKBIRDS. An Elegy. By the same. The sun had chas'd the mountain snow, And kindly loos'd the frozen soil, The melting streams began to flow, And plowmen urg'd their annual toil. 'Twas then, amid the vocal throng Whom nature wakes to mirth and love, A blackbird rais'd his am'rous song, And thus it echo'd thro' the grove. O fairest of the feather'd train! For whom I sing, for whom I burn, Attend with pity to my strain, And grant my love a kind return. For see the wintry storms are flown, And gentle Zephyrs fan the air; Let us the genial influence own, Let us the vernal pastime share. The raven plumes his jetty wing To please his croaking paramour; The larks responsive ditties sing, And tell their passion as they soar. But trust me, love, the raven's wing Is not to be compar'd with mine; Nor can the lark so sweetly sing As I, who strength with sweetness join. O! let me all thy steps attend! I'll point new treasures to thy sight; Whether the grove thy wish befriend, Or hedge-rows green, or meadows bright. I'll shew my love the clearest rill Whose streams among the pebbles stray, These will we sip, and sip our fill, Or on the flow'ry margin play. I'll lead her to the thickest brake, Impervious to the school-boy's eye; For her the plaister'd nest I'll make, And on her downy pinions lie. When prompted by a mother's care, Her warmth shall form th'imprisoned young; The pleasing task I'll gladly share, Or cheer her labours with my song. To bring her food I'll range the fields, And cull the best of every kind; Whatever nature's bounty yields, And love's assiduous care can find. And when my lovely mate would stray To taste the summer sweets at large, I'll wait at home the live-long day, And tend with care our little charge. Then prove with me the sweets of love, With me divide the cares of life; No bush shall boast in all the grove So fond a mate, so blest a wife. He ceas'd his song. The melting dame With soft indulgence heard the strain; She felt, she own'd a mutual flame, And hasted to relieve his pain. He led her to the nuptial bower, And nestled closely to her side; The fondest bridegroom of that hour, And she, the most delighted bride. Next morn he wak'd her with a song, “Behold, he said, the new-born day! “The lark his matin peal has rung, “Arise, my love, and come away.” Together thro' the fields they stray'd, And to the murm'ring riv'let's side; Renew'd their vows, and hopp'd and play'd, With honest joy, and decent pride. When oh! with grief the Muse relates The mournful sequel of my tale; Sent by an order from the fates A gunner met them in the vale. Alarm'd the lover cry'd, My dear, Haste, haste away, from danger fly; Here, gunner, point thy thunder here; O spare my love, and let me die. At him the gunner took his aim; His aim alas was all too true: O! had he chose some other game! Or shot—as he was wont to do! Divided pair! forgive the wrong, While I with tears your fate rehearse; I'll join the widow's plaintive song, And save the lover in my verse. The RAKE. By a Lady in New England. ? Video meliora proboque, Deteriora sequor. Hor. An open heart, a generous mind, But passion's slave, and wild as wind: In theory, a judge of right; Tho' banish'd from its practice quite: So loose, so prostitute of soul, His nobler wit becomes the tool Of every importuning fool: A thousand virtues misapply'd; While reason floats on passion's tide: The ruin of the caste and fair; The parent's curse, the virgin's snare: Whose false example leads astray The young, the thoughtless, and the gay: Yet, left alone to cooler thought, He knows, he sees, he feels his fault; He knows his fault, he feels, he views, Detesting what he most pursues: His judgment tells him, all his gains For fleeting joys, are lasting pains: Reason with appetite contending, Repenting still, and still offending: Abuser of the gifts of nature, A wretched, self-condemning creature, He passes o'er life's ill-trod stage; And dies, in youth, the prey of age! The scorn, the pity of the wise, Who love, lament him—and despise! FLOWERS. By ANTHONY WHISTLER, Esq; ? Ego apis matinæ More modoque, Grata carpentis thyma. Hor. I Let sages, with superfluous pains, The learned page devour; While Florio better knowledge drains From each instructive flow'r. II His fav'rite Rose his fear alarms, All opening to the sun; Like vain coquettes, who spread their charms, And shine, to be undone. III The Tulip, gaudy in its dress, And made for nought but show, In every sense, may well express The glittering, empty beau! IV The Snow-drop first but peeps to light, And fearful shews its head; Thus modest merit shines more bright, By self-distrust misled. V Th'Auric'la, which thro' labour rose, Yet shines compleat by art, The force of education shows; How much it can impart. VI He marks the Sensitive's nice fit; Nor fears he to proclaim, If each man's darling vice were hit, That he would act the same. VII Beneath each common hedge, he views The Violet, with care; Hinting we should not worth refuse, Altho' we find it there. VIII The Tuberose that lofty springs, Nor can support its height, Well represents imperious kings, Grown impotent by might. IX Fragrant, tho' pale, the Lily blows; To teach the female breast, How virtue can its sweets disclose In all complexions drest. X To every bloom that crowns the year, Nature some charm decrees; Learn hence, ye nymphs, her face to wear, Ye cannot fail to please. SONG. By the Same. [While, Strephon, thus you teize one] While, Strephon, thus you teize one, To say, what won my heart; It cannot sure be treason, If I the truth impart. 'Twas not your smile, tho' charming; 'Twas not your eyes, tho' bright; 'Twas not your bloom, tho' warming; Nor beauty's daz'ling light. 'Twas not your dress, tho' shining; Nor shape, that made me sigh: 'Twas not your tongue, combining, For that I knew—might lye. No—'twas your generous nature; Bold, soft; sincere, and gay: It shone in every feature, And stole my heart away. The CABINET. Or, Verses on Roman Medals. To Mr. W. By Mr. Graves. I Lo! the rich Casket's mimic dome! Where cells in graceful rows The triumphs of imperial Rome In miniature disclose. II Less sacred far those tinsel shrines, In which the sainted bones, And relicks, modern Rome confines, Of legendary drones. III In figur'd brass we here behold From time's wide waste retriev'd, What patriots firm or heroes bold In peace or war atchiev'd. IV Or silver orbs, in series fair, With titles deck'd around, Present each Cæsar's face and air With rays or laurels crown'd. V Ages to come shall hence be taught, In lasting lines express'd, How mighty Julius spoke or fought, Or Cleopatra dress'd. VI Augustus here with placid mien, Bids raging discord cease; The gates of War close-barr'd are seen, And all the world is peace. VII A race of tyrants then succeeds, Who frown with brow severe; Yet tho' we shudder at their deeds, Ev'n Nero charms us here. VIII Thus did the blooming Titus look, Delight of human kind: Great Hadrian thus, whose death bespoke His firm yet gentle mind. IX Aurelius too! thy stoic face Indignant we compare With young Faustina's wanton grace, And meretricious air. X Each passion here and virtue shines In liveliest emblems dress'd: Less strong in Tully's ethic lines, Or Plato's flights express'd. XI With heighten'd grace in verdant rust, Each work of ancient art, The temple, column, arch or bust Their wonted charms impart. XII All-glorious Rome, thro' martial toil, Beneath each zone obey'd, Shew'd every province, trophy, spoil, On current gold display'd. XIII Hence prodigals, that vainly spend, Promote the great design; And misers aid ambition's end, Who treasure up the coin. XIV The peasant finds in every clime The scientifick ore; Whilst on the rich remains of time, The learn'd with rapture pore. XV Each fading stroke they now retrace, Each legend dark unfold: Then in historic order place,— And copper vies with gold. XVI Happy the sage! like you, my friend, The evening of whose days Heav'n grants in that fair vale to spend Where Thames delighted strays. XVII To medals there and books of taste Those moments you consign, Which barren minds ignobly waste On dogs, or cards, or wine. XVIII Whilst I 'mid rocks and savage woods Enjoy these golden dreams; Claverton near Bath, 1750.Where Avon winds to mix her floods With Bladud's healing streams. PANACEA: Or, The Grand Restorative. By the Same. Welcome to Baiæ's streams, ye sons of spleen, Who rove from spa to spa—to shift the scene. While round the steaming fount you idly throng, Come, learn a wholsome secret from my song. Ye fair, whose roses feel th'approaching frost, And drops supply the place of spirits lost: Ye 'squires, who rack'd with gouts, at heav'n repine, Condemn'd to water for excess in wine: Ye portly cits, so corpulent and full, Who eat and drink 'till appetite grows dull: For whets and bitters then unstring the purse, Whilst nature more opprest grows worse and worse: Dupes to the craft of pill-prescribing leaches: You nod or laugh at what the parson preaches: Hear then a rhyming quack,—who spurns your wealth, And gratis gives a sure receipt for health. No more thus vainly roam o'er sea and land, When lo! a sovereign remedy at hand: 'Tis Temperance—stale cant!—'Tis Fasting then; Heaven's antidote against the sins of men. Foul luxury's the cause of all your pain: To scour th'obstructed glands, abstain! abstain! Fast and take rest, ye candidates for sleep, Who from high food tormenting vigils keep: Fast and be fat—thou starveling in a gown: Ye bloated, fast—'twill surely bring you down. Ye nymphs that pine o'er chocolate and rolls, Hence take fresh bloom, fresh vigour to your souls. Fast and fear not—you'll need no drop nor pill: Hunger may starve, excess is sure to kill. The HEROINES, or Modern Memoirs, By the Same. In ancient times, some hundred winters past, When British dames, for conscience sake, were chaste, If some frail nymph, by youthful passion sway'd, From virtue's paths unhappily had stray'd: When banish'd reason re-assum'd her place, The conscious wretch bewail'd her foul disgrace; Fled from the world, and pass'd her joyless years In decent solitude and pious tears; Veil'd in some convent made her peace with heaven, And almost hop'd—by Prudes to be forgiven. Not so of modern wh?res th'illustrious train, Renown'd Constantia, P?ton and V?ne; Grown old in sin, and dead to amorous joy, No acts of penance their great souls employ. Without a blush behold each nymph advance, The luscious Heroine of her own romance. Each harlot triumphs in her loss of fame, And boldly prints and publishes her shame. 1751. The PARTING. By the Same. Written some Years after Marriage. I The rising sun thro' all the grove Diffus'd a gladsome ray: My Lucy smil'd, and talk'd of love, And every thing look'd gay. II But oh! the fatal hour was come That forc'd me from my dear: My Lucy then thro' grief was dumb, Or spoke but by a tear. III Now far from her and bliss I roam, All nature wears a change: The azure sky seems wrapt in gloom, And every place looks strange. IV Those flow'ry fields, this verdant scene, Yon larks that towering sing, With sad contrast increase my spleen And make me loath the spring. V My books that wont to sooth my mind No longer now can please: There only those amusement find That have a mind at ease. VI Nay life itself is tasteless grown From Lucy whilst I stray: Sick of the world I muse alone And sigh the live-long day. 1748. ODE to MEMORY. 1748. By William Shenstone, Esq; I O memory! celestial maid! Who glean'st the flow'rets cropt by time; And, suffering not a leaf to fade, Preserv'st the blossoms of our prime; Bring, bring those moments to my mind When life was new, and Lesbia kind. II And bring that garland to my sight, With which my favour'd crook she bound; And bring that wreath of roses bright Which then my festive temples crown'd. And to my raptur'd ear convey The gentle things she deign'd to say. III And sketch with care the Muse's bow'r, Where Isis rolls her silver tide; Nor yet omit one reed or flow'r That shines on Cherwell's verdant side; If so thou may'st those hours prolong, When polish'd Lycon join'd my song. IV The song it 'vails not to recite— But sure, to sooth our youthful dreams, Those banks and streams appear'd more bright Than other banks, than other streams: Or by thy softening pencil shewn, Assume they beauties not their own? V And paint that sweetly vacant scene, When, all beneath the poplar bough, My spirits light, my soul serene, I breath'd in verse one cordial vow; That nothing should my soul inspire, But friendship warm, and love entire. VI Dull to the sense of new delight, On thee the drooping Muse attends; As some fond lover, robb'd of sight, On thy expressive pow'r depends; Nor would exchange thy glowing lines, To live the lord of all that shines. VII But let me chase those vows away Which at ambition's shrine I made; Nor ever let thy skill display Those anxious moments, ill repaid: Oh! from my breast that season rase, And bring my childhood in its place. VIII Bring me the bells, the rattle bring, And bring the hobby I bestrode; When pleas'd, in many a sportive ring, Around the room I jovial rode: Ev'n let me bid my lyre adieu, And bring the whistle that I blew. IX Then will I muse, and pensive say, Why did not these enjoyments last? How sweetly wasted I the day, While innocence allow'd to waste? Ambition's toils alike are vain, But ah! for pleasure yield us pain. The Princess ELIZABETH: A Ballad, alluding to a Story recorded of her, when she was a Prisoner at Woodstock, 1554. By the Same. Will you hear how once repining Great Eliza captive lay? Each ambitious thought resigning, Foe to riches, pomp, and sway? While the nymphs and swains delighted Tript around in all their pride; Envying joys by others slighted, Thus the royal maiden cry'd. Bred on plains, or born in vallies, Who would bid those scenes adieu? Stranger to the arts of malice, Who would ever courts pursue? Malice never taught to treasure, Censure never taught to bear: Love is all the shepherd's pleasure; Love is all the damsel's care. How can they of humble station Vainly blame the pow'rs above? Or accuse the dispensation Which allows them all to love? Love like air is widely given; Pow'r nor chance can these restrain; Truest, noblest gifts of heaven! Only purest on the plain! Peers can no such charms discover, All in stars and garters drest, As, on Sundays, does the lover With his nosegay on his breast. Pinks and roses in profusion, Said to fade when Chloe's near; Fops may use the same allusion, But the shepherd is sincere. Hark to yonder milk-maid singing, Cheerly o'er the brimming pail; Cowslips all around her springing Sweetly paint the golden vale. Never yet did courtly maiden Move so sprightly, look so fair; Never breast with jewels laden Pour a song so void of care. Would indulgent heav'n had granted Me some rural damsel's part! All the empire I had wanted Then had been my shepherd's heart. Then, with him, o'er hills and mountains, Free from fetters, might I rove: Fearless taste the crystal fountains; Peaceful sleep beneath the grove. Rusticks had been more forgiving; Partial to my virgin bloom: None had envy'd me when living; None had triumph'd o'er my tomb. ODE to a Young Lady, Somewhat too sollicitous about her Manner of Expression. By the Same. Survey, my fair! that lucid stream Adown the smiling valley stray; Would art attempt, or fancy dream, To regulate its winding way? So pleas'd I view thy shining hair In loose dishevel'd ringlets flow: Not all thy art, nor all thy care Can there one single grace bestow. Survey again that verdant hill, With native plants enamel'd o'er; Say, can the painter's utmost skill Instruct one flow'r to please us more? As vain it were, with artful dye, To change the bloom thy cheeks disclose; And oh may Laura, ere she try, With fresh vermilion paint the rose. Hark, how the wood-lark's tuneful throat Can every study'd grace excel; Let art constrain the rambling note, And will she, Laura, please so well? Oh ever keep thy native ease, By no pedantic laws confin'd! For Laura's voice is form'd to please, So Laura's words be not unkind. VERSES written towards the close of the Year 1748, to William Lyttelton, Esq; By the Same. How blithely pass'd the summer's day! How bright was every flow'r! While friends arriv'd, in circles gay, To visit Damon's bow'r. But now, with silent step, I range Along some lonely shore; And Damon's bow'r, alas the change! Is gay with friends no more. Away to crowds and cities borne In quest of joy they steer; Whilst I, alas! am left forlorn, To weep the parting year! O pensive Autumn! how I grieve Thy sorrowing face to see! When languid suns are taking leave Of every drooping tree. Ah let me not, with heavy eye, This dying scene survey! Haste, Winter, haste; usurp the sky; Compleat my bow'r's decay. Ill can I bear the motely cast Yon' sickening leaves retain; That speak at once of pleasure past, And bode approaching pain. At home unblest, I gaze around, My distant scenes require; Where all in murky vapours drown'd Are hamlet, hill, and spire. Tho' Thomson, sweet descriptive bard! Inspiring Autumn sung; Yet how should we the months regard, That stopp'd his flowing tongue? Ah luckless months, of all the rest, To whose hard share it fell! For sure he was the gentlest breast That ever sung so well. And see, the swallows now disown The roofs they lov'd before; Each, like his tuneful genius, flown To glad some happier shore. The wood-nymph eyes, with pale affright, The sportsman's frantick deed; While hounds and horns and yells unite To drown the Muse's reed. Ye fields with blighted herbage brown! Ye skies no longer blue! Too much we feel from fortune's frown, To bear these frowns from you. Where is the mead's unsullied green? The zephyr's balmy gale? And where sweet friendship's cordial mien, That brighten'd every vale? What tho' the vine disclose her dyes, And boast her purple store; Not all the vineyard's rich supplies Can soothe our sorrows more. He! he is gone, whose moral strain Could wit and mirth refine; He! he is gone, whose social vein Surpass'd the pow'r of wine. Fast by the streams he deign'd to praise, In yon' sequester'd grove, To him a votive urn I raise; To him, and friendly love. Yes there, my friend! forlorn and sad, I grave your Thomson's name; And there, his lyre; which fate forbad To sound your growing fame. There shall my plaintive song recount Dark themes of hopeless woe; And, faster than the dropping fount, I'll teach mine eyes to flow. There leaves, in spite of Autumn, green, Shall shade the hallow'd ground; And Spring will then again be seen, To call forth flowers around. But no kind suns will bid me share, Once more, His social hour; Ah Spring! thou never canst repair This loss, to Damon's bow'r. SONGS. By the Same. I. [In a vale fring'd with woodland, where grottos abound] In a vale fring'd with woodland, where grottos abound, And rivulets murmur, and echoes resound, I vow'd to the Muses my time and my care; Since neither could win me the smiles of my fair. As freedom inspir'd me, I rang'd and I sung; And Daphne's dear name never fell from my tongue And if once a smooth accent delighted my ear, I should wish, unawares, that my Daphne might hear With sairest ideas my bosom I stor'd; Allusions to none but the nymph I ador'd; And the more I with study my fancy refin'd, The deeper impressions she made on my mind. Ah! whilst I the beauties of nature pursue, I still must my Daphne's fair image renew: The Graces have chosen with Daphne to rove, And the Muses are all in alliance with Love. II. Daphne's Visit. Ye birds! for whom I rear'd the grove, With melting lay salute my love: My Daphne with your notes detain: Or I have rear'd my grove in vain. Ye flow'rs before her footsteps rise; Display at once your brightest dyes; That she your opening charms may see: Or what were all your charms to me? Kind Zephyr! brush each fragrant flow'r, And shed its odours round my bow'r: Or never more, O gentle wind, Shall I, from thee, refreshment find. Ye streams! if e'er your banks I lov'd, If e'er your native sounds improv'd, May each soft murmur soothe my fair: Or oh! 'twill deepen my despair. And thou, my grot! whose lonely bounds The melancholy pine surrounds, May Daphne praise thy peaceful gloom; Or thou shalt prove her Damon's tomb. III. The Rose-Bud. See, Flavia, see that budding rose, How bright beneath the bush it glows; How safely there it lurks conceal'd; How quickly blasted, when reveal'd! The sun with warm attractive rays Tempts it to wanton in the blaze: A blast descends from eastern skies, And all its blushing radiance dies. Then guard, my fair! your charms divine; And check the fond desire to shine Where fame's transporting rays allure, While here more happy, more secure. The breath of some neglected maid Shall make you sigh you left the shade: A breath to beauty's bloom unkind, As, to the rose, an eastern wind. The nymph reply'd, “You first, my swain, “Confine your sonnets to the plain; “One envious tongue alike disarms, “You, of your wit, me, of my charms. “What is, unheard, the tuneful thrill? “Or what, unknown, the poet's skill? “What, unadmir'd, a charming mien, “Or what the rose's blush, unseen?” IV. Written in a Collection of Bacchanalian Songs. Adieu, ye jovial youths, who join To plunge old Care in floods of wine; And, as your dazled eye-balls roll, Discern him struggling in the bowl. Nor yet is hope so wholly flown, Nor yet is thought so tedious grown, But limpid stream and shady tree Retain, as yet, some sweets for me. And see, thro' yonder silent grove, See yonder does my Daphne rove: With pride her foot-steps I pursue, And bid your frantick joys adieu. The sole confusion I admire, Is that my Daphne's eyes inspire: I scorn the madness you approve, And value reason next to love. V. Imitated from the French. Yes, these are the scenes where with Iris I stray'd; But short was her sway for so lovely a maid; In the bloom of her youth to a cloister she run; In the bloom of her graces, too fair for a nun! Ill-grounded, no doubt, a devotion must prove So fatal to beauty, so killing to love! Yes, these are the meadows, the shrubs and the plains; Once the scene of my pleasures, the scene of my pains; How many soft moments I spent in this grove! How fair was my nymph! and how fervent my love! Be still tho', my heart; thine emotion give o'er; Remember, the season of love is no more. With her how I stray'd amid fountains and bow'rs, Or loiter'd behind and collected the flow'rs! Then breathless with ardor my fair-one pursu'd, And to think with what kindness my garland she view'd! But be still, my fond heart! this emotion give o'er; Fain wouldst thou forget thou must love her no more. RURAL INSCRIPTIONS. By the Same. [I.] On a Root-House. Here in cool grot, and mossy cell, We rural fays and faeries dwell: Tho' rarely seen by mortal eye, When the pale moon, ascending high, Darts thro' yon' limes her quivering beams, We frisk it near these crystal streams. Her beams, reflected from the wave, Afford the light our revels crave; The turf, with daisies broider'd o'er, Exceeds, we wot, the Parian floor; Nor yet for artful strains we call, But listen to the water's fall. Would you then taste our tranquil scene, Be sure your bosoms be serene; Devoid of hate, devoid of strife, Devoid of all that poisons life; And much it 'vails you, in their place, To graft the love of human race. And tread with awe these favour'd bow'rs, Nor wound the shrubs nor bruise the flow'rs; So may your paths with sweets abound! So may your couch with rest be crown'd! But harm betide the wayward swain, Who dares our hallow'd haunt profane! Oberon. II. In a shady Valley, near a running Water. O! let me haunt this peaceful shade; Nor let ambition e'er invade The tenants of this leafy bow'r, That shun her paths, and slight her pow'r. Hither the plaintive halcyon flies From social meads and open skies; Pleas'd, by this rill, her course to steer, And hide her saphire plumage here. The trout, bedropt with crimson stains, Forsakes the river's proud domains; Forsakes the sun's unwelcome gleam, To lurk within this humble stream. And sure I heard the Naiad say, “Flow, flow, my stream! this devious way; “Tho' lovely soft thy murmurs are, “Thy waters, lovely cool and fair! “Flow, gentle stream! nor let the vain “Thy small unsully'd stores disdain: “Nor let the pensive sage repine, “Whose latent course resembles thine.” III. On a small Building in the Gothick Taste. O you that bathe in courtly blysse! Or toyle in fortune's giddye spheare! Doo not too rashlye deeme amysse Of him, that bydes contentid here. Nor yet disdeigne the russet stoale, Whyche o'er each carelesse lymbe he flyngs: Nor yet deryde the beechen bowle, In whyche he quaffs the lympid spryngs. Forgyve hym, if, at eve or dawne, Devoyde of worldlye carke he stray: Or, all besyde some flowerye lawne, He waste his inoffensive day. So may He pardonne fraud and strife, If such in courtlye haunt he see: For faults there beene in busye lyfe, From whyche these peacefull glennes are free. A Pastoral BALLAD, in Four Parts. Written 1743. By the Same. Arbusta humilesque myricæ. Virg. I. Absence. I Ye shepherds so cheerful and gay, Whose flocks never carelessly roam; Should Corydon's happen to stray, Oh! call the poor wanderers home. Allow me to muse and to sigh, Nor talk of the change that ye find; None once was so watchful as I: —I have left my dear Phyllis behind. II Now I know what it is, to have strove With the torture of doubt and desire; What it is, to admire and to love, And to leave her we love and admire. Ah lead forth my flock in the morn, And the damps of each ev'ning repell; Alas! I am faint and forlorn: —I have bade my dear Phyllis farewell. III Since Phyllis vouchsaf'd me a look, I never once dreamt of my vine; May I lose both my pipe and my crook, If I knew of a kid that was mine. I priz'd every hour that went by, Beyond all that had pleas'd me before; But now they are past, and I sigh; And I grieve that I priz'd them no more. IV But why do I languish in vain? Why wander thus pensively here? Oh! why did I come from the plain, Where I fed on the smiles of my dear? They tell me, my favourite maid, The pride of that valley, is flown; Alas! where with her I have stray'd, I could wander with pleasure, alone. V When forc'd the fair nymph to forego, What anguish I felt at my heart! Yet I thought—but it might not be so— 'Twas with pain that she saw me depart. She gaz'd, as I slowly withdrew; My path I could hardly discern; So sweetly she bade me adieu, I thought that she bade me return. VI The pilgrim that journeys all day To visit some far-distant shrine, If he bear but a relique away, Is happy, nor heard to repine. Thus widely remov'd from the fair, Where my vows, my devotion, I owe, Soft hope is the relique I bear, And my solace wherever I go. II. Hope. I My banks they are furnish'd with bees, Whose murmur invites one to sleep; My grottos are shaded with trees, And my hills are white-over with sheep. I seldom have met with a loss, Such health do my fountains bestow; My fountains all border'd with moss, Where the hare-bells and violets grow. II Not a pine in my grove is there seen, But with tendrils of woodbine is bound: Not a beech's more beautiful green, But a sweet-briar twines it around. Not my fields, in the prime of the year, More charms than my cattle unfold: Not a brook that is limpid and clear, But it glitters with fishes of gold. III One would think she might like to retire To the bow'r I have labour'd to rear; Not a shrub that I heard her admire, But I hasted and planted it there. O how sudden the jessamin strove With the lilac to render it gay! Already it calls for my love. To prune the wild branches away. IV From the plains, from the woodlands and groves, What strains of wild melody flow? How the nightingales warble their loves From thickets of roses that blow! And when her bright form shall appear, Each bird shall harmoniously join In a concert so soft and so clear, As—she may not be fond to resign. V I have found out a gift for my fair; I have found where the wood-pigeons breed: But let me that plunder forbear, She will say 'twas a barbarous deed. For he ne'er could be true, she aver'd, Who could rob a poor bird of its young: And I lov'd her the more, when I heard Such tenderness fall from her tongue. VI I have heard her with sweetness unfold How that pity was due to—a dove: That it ever attended the bold, And she call'd it the sister of love. But her words such a pleasure convey, So much I her accents adore, Let her speak, and whatever she say, Methinks I should love her the more. VII Can a bosom so gentle remain Unmov'd, when her Corydon sighs? Will a nymph that is fond of the plain, These plains, and this valley despise? Dear regions of silence and shade! Soft scenes of contentment and ease! Where I could have pleasingly stray'd, If aught, in her absence, could please. VIII But where does my Phyllida stray? And where are her grots and her bow'rs? Are the groves and the valleys as gay, And the shepherds as gentle as ours? The groves may perhaps be as fair, And the face of the valleys as fine; The swains may in manners compare, But their love is not equal to mine. III. Solicitude. I Why will you my passion reprove? Why term it a folly to grieve? Ere I shew you the charms of my love, She is fairer than you can believe. With her mien she enamours the brave; With her wit she engages the free; With her modesty pleases the grave; She is ev'ry way pleasing to me. II O you that have been of her train, Come and join in my amorous lays; I could lay down my life for the swain That will sing but a song in her praise. When he sings, may the nymphs of the town Come trooping, and listen the while; Nay on Him let not Phillida frown; —But I cannot allow her to smile. III For when Paridel tries in the dance Any favour with Phyllis to find, O how, with one trivial glance, Might she ruin the peace of my mind! In ringlets He dresses his hair, And his crook is be-studded around; And his pipe—oh may Phyllis beware Of a magic there is in the sound. IV 'Tis His with mock passion to glow; 'Tis His in smooth tales to unfold, “How her face is as bright as the snow, “And her bosom, be sure, is as cold; “How the nightingales labour the strain, “With the notes of his charmer to vie; “How they vary their accents in vain, “Repine at her triumphs, and die.” V To the grove or the garden he strays, And pillages every sweet; Then, suiting the wreath to his lays He throws it at Phyllis's feet. “O Phyllis, he whispers, more fair, “More sweet than the jessamin's flow'r! “What are pinks, in a morn, to compare? “What is eglantine after a show'r? VI “Then the lily no longer is white; “Then the rose is depriv'd of its bloom; “Then the violets die with despight, “And the wood-bines give up their perfume.” Thus glide the soft numbers along, And he fancies no shepherd his peer; —Yet I never should envy the song, Were not Phyllis to lend it an ear. VII Let his crook be with hyacinths bound, So Phyllis the trophy despise; Let his forehead with laurels be crown'd, So they shine not in Phillis's eyes. The language that flows from the heart Is a stranger to Paridel's tongue; —Yet may she beware of his art, Or sure I must envy the song. IV. Disappointment. I Ye shepherds give ear to my lay, And take no more heed of my sheep: They have nothing to do, but to stray; I have nothing to do, but to weep. Yet do not my folly reprove; She was fair—and my passion begun; She smil'd—and I could not but love; She is faithless—and I am undone. II Perhaps I was void of all thought; Perhaps it was plain to foresee, That a nymph so compleat would be sought By a swain more engaging than me. Ah! love ev'ry hope can inspire: It banishes wisdom the while; And the lip of the nymph we admire Seems for ever adorn'd with a smile. III She is faithless, and I am undone; Ye that witness the woes I endure, Let reason instruct you to shun What it cannot instruct you to cure. Beware how ye loiter in vain Amid nymphs of an higher degree: It is not for me to explain How fair, and how fickle they be. IV Alas! from the day that we met, What hope of an end to my woes? When I cannot endure to forget The glance that undid my repose. Yet time may diminish the pain: The flow'r, and the shrub, and the tree, Which I rear'd for her pleasure in vain, In time may have comfort for me. V The sweets of a dew-sprinkled rose, The sound of a murmuring stream, The peace which from solitude flows, Henceforth shall be Corydon's theme. High transports are shewn to the sight, But we are not to find them our own; Fate never bestow'd such delight, As I with my Phyllis had known. VI O ye woods, spread your branches apace; To your deepest recesses I fly; I would hide with the beasts of the chace; I would vanish from every eye. Yet my reed shall resound thro' the grove With the same sad complaint it begun; How she smil'd, and I could not but love; Was faithless, and I am undone!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. V. RURAL ELEGANCE: An ODE to the late Duchess of Somerset. Written 1750. By WILLIAM SHENSTONE, Esq; I. While orient skies restore the day, And dew-drops catch the lucid ray; Amid the sprightly scenes of morn, Will aught the Muse inspire? Oh! peace to yonder clamorous horn That drowns the sacred lyre! II. Ye rural Thanes that o'er the mossy down Some panting, timorous hare pursue; Does nature mean your joys alone to crown? Say, does she smoothe her lawns for you? For you does Echo bid the rocks reply, And urg'd by rude constraint resound the jovial cry? III. See from the neighbouring hill, forlorn The wretched swain your sport survey; He finds his faithful fences torn, He finds his labour'd crops a prey; He sees his flock—no more in circles feed; Haply beneath your ravage bleed, And with no random curses loads the deed. IV. Nor yet, ye swains, conclude That Nature smiles for you alone; Your bounded souls, and your conceptions crude, The proud, the selfish boast disown: Yours be the produce of the soil; O may it still reward your toil! Nor ever the defenceless train Of clinging infants, ask support in vain! V. But tho' the various harvest gild your plains, Does the mere landschape feast your eye? Or the warm hope of distant gains Far other cause of glee supply? Is not the red-streak's future juice The source of your delight profound, Where Ariconium pours her gems profuse, Purpling a whole horizon round? Athirst ye praise the limpid stream, 'tis true: But tho', the pebbled shores among, It mimick no unpleasing song, The limpid fountain murmurs not for you. VI. Unpleas'd ye see the thickets bloom, Unpleas'd the Spring her flowery robe resume; Unmov'd the mountain's airy pile, The dappled mead without a smile. O let a rural conscious Muse, For well she knows, your froward sense accuse: Forth to the solemn oak you bring the square, And span the massy trunk, before you cry, 'tis fair. VII. Nor yet ye learn'd, not yet ye courtly train, If haply from your haunts ye stray To waste with us a summer's day, Exclude the taste of every swain, Nor our untutor'd sense disdain: 'Tis Nature only gives exclusive right To relish her supreme delight; She, where she pleases kind or coy, Who furnishes the scene, and forms us to enjoy. VIII. Then higher bring the fair ingenuous mind, By her auspicious aid refin'd; Lo! not an hedge-row hawthorn blows, Or humble hare-bell paints the plain, Or valley winds, or fountain flows, Or purple heath is ting'd in vain: For such the rivers dash their foaming tides, The mountain swells, the dale subsides; Ev'n thriftless furze detains their wandering sight, And the rough barren rock grows pregnant with delight. IX. With what suspicious fearful care The sordid wretch secures his claim, If haply some luxurious heir Should alienate the fields that wear his name! What scruples lest some future birth Should litigate a span of earth! Bonds, contracts, feoffments, names unmeet for prose, The towering Muse endures not to disclose; Alas! her unrevers'd decree, More comprehensive and more free, Her lavish charter, Taste, appropriates all we see. X. Let gondolas their painted flags unfold, And be the solemn day enroll'd, When, to confirm his lofty plea, In nuptial sort, with bridal gold, The grave Venetian weds the sea: Each laughing Muse derides the vow; Ev'n Adria scorns the mock embrace, To some lone hermit on the mountain's brow, Allotted, from his natal hour, With all her myrtle shores in dow'r. His breast to admiration prone Enjoys the smile upon her face, Enjoys triumphant every grace, And finds her more his own. XI. Fatigu'd with form's oppressive laws, When Somerset avoids the Great; When cloy'd with merited applause, She seeks the rural calm retreat; Does she not praise each mossy cell, And feel the truth my numbers tell? When deafen'd by the loud acclaim, Which genius grac'd with rank obtains, Could she not more delighted hear Yon throstle chaunt the rising year? Could she not spurn the wreaths of fame, To crop the primrose of the plains? Does she not sweets in each fair valley find, Lost to the sons of pow'r, unknown to half mankind? XII. Ah can she covet there to see The splendid slaves, the reptile race, That oil the tongue, and bow the knee, That slight her merit, but adore her place? Far happier, if aright I deem, When from gay throngs, and gilded spires, To where the lonely halcyons play, Her philosophick step retires: While studious of the moral theme, She, to some smooth sequester'd stream Likens the swain's inglorious day; Pleas'd from the flowery margin to survey, How cool, serene, and clear the current glides away. XIII. O blind to truth, to virtue blind, Who slight the sweetly-pensive mind! On whose fair birth the Graces mild, And every Muse prophetick smil'd. Not that the poet's boasted fire Should Fame's wide-echoing trumpet swell; Or, on the musick of his lyre Each future age with rapture dwell; The vaunted sweet of praise remove, Yet shall such bosoms claim a part In all that glads the human heart; Yet these the spirits, form'd to judge and prove All nature's charms immense, and Heav'n's unbounded love. XIV. And oh! the transport, most ally'd to song, In some fair villa's peaceful bound, To catch soft hints from Nature's tongue, And bid Arcadia bloom around: Whether we fringe the sloping hill, Or smoothe below the verdant mead; Whether we break the falling rill, Or thro' meandering mazes lead; Or in the horrid bramble's room Bid careless groups of roses bloom; Or let some shelter'd lake serene Reflect flow'rs, woods and spires, and brighten all the scene. XV. O sweet disposal of the rural hour! O beauties never known to cloy! While worth and genius haunt the favour'd bow'r, And every gentle breast partakes the joy! While Charity at eve surveys the swain, Enabled by these toils to chear A train of helpless infants dear, Speed whistling home across the plain; Sees vagrant Luxury, her hand-maid grown, For half her graceless deeds attone, And hails the bounteous work, and ranks it with her own. XVI. Why brand these pleasures with the name Of soft, unsocial toils, of indolence and shame? Search but the garden, or the wood, Let yon admir'd carnation own, Not all was meant for raiment, or for food, Not all for needful use alone; There while the seed of future blossoms dwell, 'Tis colour'd for the sight, perfum'd to please the smell. XVII. Why knows the nightingale to sing? Why flows the pine's nectareous juice? Why shines with paint the linnet's wing? For sustenance alone? for use? For preservation? Every sphere Shall bid fair Pleasure's rightful claim appear. And sure there seem, of human kind, Some born to shun the solemn strife; Some for amusive tasks design'd, To soothe the certain ills of life; Grace it's lone vales with many a budding rose, New founts of bliss disclose, Call forth refreshing shades, and decorate repose. XVIII. From plains and woodlands; from the view Of rural Nature's blooming face, Smit with the glare of rank and place, To courts the sons of Fancy flew; There long had Art ordain'd a rival seat; There had she lavish'd all her care To form a scene more dazling fair, And call'd them from their green retreat To share her proud controul; Had giv'n the robe with grace to flow, Had taught exotick gems to flow; And emulous of nature's pow'r, Mimick'd the plume, the leaf, the flow'r; Chang'd the complexion's native hue, Moulded each rustick limb anew, And warp'd the very soul! XIX. Awhile her magick strikes the novel eye, Awhile the faery forms delight; And now aloof we seem to fly On purple pinions thro' a purer sky, Where all is wonderous, all is bright: Now landed on some spangled shore Awhile each dazled maniac roves By saphire lakes, thro' em'rald groves, Paternal acres please no more; Adieu the simple, the sincere delight— Th'habitual scene of hill and dale, The rural herds, the vernal gale, The tangled vetch's purple bloom, The fragrance of the bean's perfume, Be theirs alone who cultivate the soil, And drink the cup of thirst, and eat the bread of toil, XX. But soon the pageant fades away! 'Tis Nature only bears perpetual sway. We pierce the counterfeit delight, Fatigu'd with splendour's irksome beams, Fancy again demands the sight Of native groves, and wonted streams, Pants for the scenes that charm'd her youthful eyes, Where Truth maintains her court, and banishes disguise. XXI. Then hither oft ye senators retire, With Nature here high converse hold; For who like Stamford her delights admire, Like Stamford shall with scorn behold Th'unequal bribes of pageantry and gold; Beneath the British oak's majestick shade, Shall see fair Truth, immortal maid, Friendship in artless guise array'd, Honour, and moral Beauty shine With more attractive charms, with radiance more divine. XXII. Yes, here alone did highest Heav'n ordain The lasting magazine of charms, Whatever wins, whatever warms, Whatever fancy seeks to share, The great, the various, and the fair, For ever should remain! XXIII. Her impulse nothing may restrain— Or whence the joy 'mid columns, tow'rs, 'Midst all the city's artful trim, To rear some breathless vapid flow'rs, Or shrubs fuliginously grim: From rooms of silken foliage vain, To trace the dun far distant grove, Where smit with undissembled pain, The wood-lark mourns her absent love, Borne to the dusty town from native air, To mimick rural life, and soothe some vapour'd fair. XXIV. But how must faithless Art prevail, Should all who taste our joy sincere, To virtue, truth or science dear, Forego a court's alluring pale, For dimpled brook and leafy grove, For that rich luxury of thought they love! Ah no, from these the publick sphere requires Example for it's giddy bands; From these impartial Heav'n demands To spread the flame itself inspires; To sift Opinion's mingled mass, Impress a nation's taste, and bid the sterling pass. XXV. Happy, thrice happy they, Whose graceful deeds have exemplary shone Round the gay precincts of a throne, With mild effective beams! Who bands of fair ideas bring, By solemn grott, or shady spring, To join their pleasing dreams! Theirs is the rural bliss without alloy, They only that deserve, enjoy. What tho' nor fabled Dryad haunt their grove, Nor Naiad near their fountains rove, Yet all embody'd to the mental sight, A train of smiling Virtues bright Shall there the wise retreat allow, Shall twine triumphant palms to deck the wanderer's brow. XXVI. And though by faithless friends alarm'd, Art have with Nature wag'd presumptuous war; By Seymour's winning influence charm'd, In whom their gifts united shine, No longer shall their counsels jar. 'Tis hers to mediate the peace: Near Percy-lodge, with awe-struck mien, The rebel seeks her lawful Queen, And havock and contention cease. I see the rival pow'rs combine, And aid each other's fair design; Nature exalt the mound where Art shall build; Art shape the gay alcove, while Nature paints the field. XXVII. Begin, ye songsters of the grove! O warble forth your noblest lay; Where Somerset vouchsafes to rove Ye leverets freely sport and play. —Peace to the strepent horn! Let no harsh dissonance disturb the morn, No sounds inelegant and rude Her sacred solitudes profane! Unless her candour not exclude The lowly shepherd's votive strain, Who tunes his reed amist his rural chear, Fearful, yet no averse, that Somerset should hear. Inscription near a Sheep-cote. 1745. By the Same. Shepherd, would'st thou here obtain Pleasure unalloy'd with pain? Joy that suits the rural sphere? Gentle shepherd! lend an ear. Learn to relish calm delight, Verdant vales, and fountains bright; Trees that nod on sloping hills, Caves that echo tinkling rills. If thou can'st no charm disclose In the simplest bud that blows; Go, forsake thy plain and fold, Join the crowd, and toil for gold. Tranquil pleasures never cloy; Banish each tumultuous joy: All but love—for love inspires Fonder wishes, fiercer fires. Love and all its joys be thine— Yet, ere thou the reins resign, Hear what reason seems to say, Hear attentive, and obey. “Crimson leaves the rose adorn, “But beneath 'em lurks a thorn: “Fair and flowery is the brake, “Yet it hides the vengeful snake. “Think not she, whose empty pride “Dares the fleecy garb deride; “Think not she who, light and vain, “Scorns the sheep, can love the swain. “Artless deed and simple dress, “Mark the chosen shepherdess; “Thoughts by decency controul'd, “Well conceiv'd, and freely told. “Sense that shuns each conscious air, “Wit that falls ere well aware; “Generous pity, prone to sigh “If her kid or lambkin die. “Let not lucre, let not pride “Draw thee from such charms aside; “Have not those their proper sphere? “Gentler passions triumph here. “See, to sweeten thy repose, “The blossom buds, the fountain flows; “Lo! to crown thy healthful board, “All that milk and fruits afford. “Seek no more—the rest is vain: “Pleasure ending soon in pain: “Anguish lightly gilded o'er: “Close thy wish, and seek no more.” NANCY of the VALE. A BALLAD. By the Same. Nerine Galatea! thymo mihi dulcior Hyblæ! Candidior cygnis, hederâ formosior albâ! The western sky was purpled o'er With every pleasing ray: And flocks reviving felt no more The sultry heats of day: When from an hazle's artless bower Soft-warbled Strephon's tongue; He blest the scene, he blest the hour, While Nancy's praise he sung. “Let fops with fickle falshood range The paths of wanton love, Whilst weeping maids lament their change, And sadden every grove: But endless blessings crown the day, I saw fair Esham's dale! And every blessing find its way To Nancy of the Vale. 'Twas from Avona's banks the maid Diffus'd her lovely beams; And every shining glance display'd The Naïd of the streams. Soft as the wild-duck's tender young, That float on Avon's tide; Bright as the water-lily, sprung, And glittering near its side. Fresh as the bordering flowers, her bloom: Her eye, all mild to view; The little halcyon's azure plume Was never half so blue. Her shape was like the reed so sleek, So taper, strait, and fair; Her dimpled smile, her blushing cheek, How charming sweet they were! Far in the winding Vale retir'd, This peerless bud I found; And shadowing rocks, and woods conspir'd To fence her beauties round. That Nature in so lone a dell Should form a Nymph so sweet! Or Fortune to her secret cell Conduct my wandering feet! Gay lordlings sought her for their bride, But she would ne'er incline: “Prove to your equals true, she cry'd, “As I will prove to mine. “'Tis Strephon, on the mountain's brow, “Has won my right good will; “To him I gave my plighted vow, “With him I'll climb the hill.” Struck with her charms and gentle truth, I clasp'd the constant fair; To her alone I gave my youth, And vow my future care. And when this vow shall faithless prove, Or I those charms forego; The stream that saw our tender love, That stream shall cease to flow. ODE to INDOLENCE, 1750. By the Same. Ah! why for ever on the wing Persists my weary'd soul to roam? Why, ever cheated, strives to bring Or pleasure or contentment home? Thus the poor bird, that draws his name From paradise's honour'd groves, Ceaseless fatigues his little frame; Nor finds the resting place he loves. Lo! on the rural mossy bed My limbs with careless ease reclin'd; Ah, gentle Sloth! indulgent spread The same soft bandage o'er my mind. For why should lingering thought invade, Yet every worldly prospect cloy? Lend me, soft Sloth, thy friendly aid, And give me peace, debarr'd of joy. Lov'st thou yon calm and silent flood, That never ebbs, that never flows; Protected by the circling wood From each tempestuous wind that blows? An altar on its bank shall rise, Where oft thy votary shall be found; What time pale Autumn lulls the skies, And sickening verdure fades around. Ye busy, race, ye factious train, That haunt Ambition's guilty shrine; No more perplex the world in vain, But offer here your vows with mine. And thou, puissant Queen! be kind: If e'er I shar'd thy balmy pow'r; If e'er I sway'd my active mind, To weave for Thee the rural bow'r; Dissolve in sleep each anxious care; Each unavailing sigh remove; And only let me wake to share The sweets of Friendship and of Love. ODE to HEALTH, 1730. By the Same. O health, capricious maid! Why dost thou shun my peaceful bow'r, Where I had hope to share thy pow'r, And bless thy lasting aid? Since thou, alas! art flown, It 'vails not whether Muse or Grace, With tempting smile, frequent the place: I sigh for thee alone. Age not forbids thy stay; Thou yet might'st act the friendly part; Thou yet might'st raise this languid heart; Why speed so swift away? Thou scorn'st the city-air; I breathe fresh gales o'er furrow'd ground, Yet hast not thou my wishes crown'd, O false! O partial fair! I plunge into the wave; And tho' with purest hands I raise A rural altar to thy praise, Thou wilt not deign to save. Amid my well-known grove, Where mineral fountains vainly bear Thy boasted name, and titles fair, Why scorns thy foot to rove? Thou hear'st the sportsman's claim; Enabling him, with idle noise, To drown the Muse's melting voice, And fright the timorous game. Is Thought thy foe? adieu Ye midnight lamps! ye curious tomes! Mine eye o'er hill and valley roams, And deals no more with you. Is it the Clime you flee? Yet 'midst his unremitting snows, The poor Laponian's bosom glows; And shares bright rays from thee. There was, there was a time, When tho' I scorn'd thy guardian care, Nor made a vow, nor said a pray'r I did not rue the crime. Who then more blest than me? When the glad school-boy's task was done, And forth, with jocund sprite, I run To freedom, and to glee! How jovial then the day! What since have all my labours found, Thus climbing life, to gaze around, That can thy loss repay? Wert thou, alas! but kind, Methinks no frown that Fortune wears, Nor lessen'd hopes, nor growing cares, Could sink my chearful mind. Whate'er my stars include; What other breasts convert to pain, My towering mind should soon disdain, Should scorn—Ingratitude! Repair this mouldering cell, And blest with objects found at home, And envying none their fairer dome, How pleas'd my soul should dwell! Temperance should guard the doors; From room to room should Memory stray, And, ranging all in neat array, Enjoy her pleasing stores— There let them rest unknown, The types of many a pleasing scene; But to preserve them bright or clean, Is thine, fair Queen! alone. To a LADY of QUALITY, Fitting up her Library, 1738. By the Same. Ah! what is Science, what is Art, Or what the pleasure these impart? Ye trophies which the Learn'd pursue Through endless fruitless toils, adieu! What can the tedious tomes bestow, To soothe the miseries they show? What, like the bliss for him decreed, Who tends his flock, and tunes his reed! Say, wretched Fancy! thus refin'd From all that glads the simplest hind, How rare that object, which supplies A charm for too discerning eyes! The polish'd bard, of genius vain, Endures a deeper sense of pain: As each invading blast devours The richest fruits, the fairest flow'rs. Sages, with irksome waste of time, The steep ascent of Knowledge climb: Then, from the tow'ring heights they scale, Behold Contentment range—the vale. Yet why, Asteria, tell us why We scorn the crowd, when you are nigh: Why then does reason seem so fair, Why learning then, deserve our care? Who can unpleas'd your shelves behold, While you so fair a proof unfold What force the brightest genius draws From polish'd Wisdom's written laws? Where are our humbler tenets flown? What strange perfection bids us own That Bliss with toilsome Science dwells, And happiest he, who most excels? UPON A VISIT to the same in Winter, 1748. By the Same. I On fair Asteria's blissful plains, Where ever-blooming Fancy reigns, How pleas'd we pass the winter's day; And charm the dull-ey'd Spleen away! II No linnet, from the leafless bough, Pours forth her note melodious now; But all admire Asteria's tongue, Nor wish the linnet's vernal song. III No flow'rs emit their transient rays: Yet sure Asteria's wit displays More various tints, more glowing lines, And with perennial beauty shines. IV Tho' rifled groves and fetter'd streams But ill befriend a poet's dreams: Asteria's presence wakes the lyre; And well supplies poetick fire. V The fields have lost their lovely dye; No chearful azure decks the sky; Yet still we bless the louring day: Asteria smiles—and all is gay. VI Hence let the Muse no more presume To blame the Winter's dreary gloom; Accuse his loitering hours no more; But ah! their envious haste deplore! VII For soon, from wit and friendship's reign, The social hearth, the sprightly vein, I go—to meet the coming year, On savage plains, and deserts drear! VIII I go—to feed on pleasures flown, Nor find the spring my loss atone! But 'mid the flowery sweets of May With pride recal this winter's day. An irregular ODE after Sickness, 1749. By the Same. ? Melius, cum venerit Ipsa, canemus. I. Too long a stranger to repose, At length from Pain's abhorred couch I rose, And wander'd forth alone; To court once more the balmy breeze, And catch the verdure of the trees, Ere yet their charms were flown. II. 'Twas from a bank with pansies gay I hail'd once more the chearful day, The sun's forgotten beams: O sun! how pleasing were thy rays, Reflected from the polish'd face Of yon refulgent streams! III. Rais'd by the scene my feeble tongue Essay'd again the sweets of song: And thus in feeble strains and slow, The loitering numbers 'gan to flow. IV. “Come, gentle air! my languid limbs restore, “And bid me welcome from the Stygian shore: “For sure I heard the tender sighs, “I seem'd to join the plaintive cries “Of hapless youths, who thro' the myrtle grove “Bewail for ever their unfinish'd love: “To that unjoyous clime, “Torn from the sight of these etherial skies; “Debarr'd the lustre of their Delia's eyes; “And banish'd in their prime. V. “Come, gentle Air! and, while the thickets bloom, “Convey the jasmin's breath divine, “Convey the woodbine's rich perfume, “Nor spare the sweet-leaft eglantine. “And may'st thou shun the rugged storm “Till Health her wonted charms explain, “With rural pleasure in her train, “To greet me in her fairest form. “While from this lofty mount I view “The sons of earth, the vulgar crew, “Anxious for futile gains beneath me stray, “And seek with erring step Contentment's obvious way. VI. “Come, gentle Air! and thou celestial Muse, “Thy genial flame infuse; “Enough to lend a pensive bosom aid, “And gild Retirement's gloomy shade; “Enough to rear such rustic lays “As foes may slight, but partial friends will praise.” VII The gentle Air allow'd my claim; And, more to chear my drooping frame, She mix'd the balm of op'ning flowers; Such as the bee, with chymic powers, From Hybla's fragrant hill inhales, Or scent Sabea's blooming vales. But ah! the Nymphs that heal the pensive mind, By prescripts more refin'd, Neglect their votary's anxious moan: Oh, how should They relieve?—the Muses all were flown. VIII. By flowery plain, or woodland shades, I fondly sought the charming maids; By woodland shades, or flow'ry plain, I sought them, faithless maids! in vain! When lo! in happier hour, I leave behind my native mead, To range where zeal and friendship lead, To visit ?'s honor'd bower. Ah foolish man! to seek the tuneful maids On other plains, or near less verdant shades; IX. Scarce have my footsteps press'd the favor'd ground, When sounds etherial strike my ear; At once celestial forms appear; My fugitives are found! The Muses here attune their lyres, Ah partial! with unwonted fires; Here, hand in hand, with careless mien, The sportive Graces trip the green. X. But whilst I wander'd o'er a scene so fair, Too well at one survey I trace, How every Muse, and every Grace, Had long employ'd their care. Lurks not a stone enrich'd with lively stain, Blooms not a flower amid the vernal store, Falls not a plume on India's distant plain, Glows not a shell on Adria's rocky shore, But torn methought from native lands or seas, From their arrangement, gain fresh pow'r to please. XI. And some had bent the wildering maze, Bedeckt with every shrub that blows; And some entwin'd the willing sprays, To shield th'illustrious Dame's repose: Others had grac'd the sprightly dome, And taught the portrait where to glow; Others arrang'd the curious tome; Or 'mid the decorated space, Assign'd the laurel'd bust a place, And given to learning all the pomp of show, And now from every task withdrawn, They met and frisk'd it o'er the lawn. XII. Ah! woe is me, said I; And ?'s hilly circuit heard me cry, Have I for this, with labour strove, And lavish'd all my little store To fence for you my shady grove, And scollop every winding shore; And fringe with every purple rose, The saphire stream that down my valley flows? XIII. Ah! lovely treacherous maids! To quit unseen my votive shades, When pale disease, and torturing pain Had torn me from the breezy plain, And to a restless couch confin'd, Who ne'er your wonted tasks declin'd. She needs not your officious aid To swell the song, or plan the shade; By genuine Fancy fir'd, Her native Genius guides her hand, And while she marks the sage command, More lovely scenes her skill shall raise, Her lyre resound with nobler lays Than ever you inspir'd. Thus I my rage and grief display; But vainly blame, and vainly mourn, Nor will a Grace or Muse return Till Luxborough lead the way. ANACREONTIC, 1738. By the Same. 'Twas in a cool Aonian glade, The wanton Cupid, spent with toil, Had sought refreshment from the shade; And stretch'd him on the mossy soil. A vagrant Muse drew nigh, and found The subtle traitor fast asleep; And is it thine to snore profound, She said, yet leave the world to weep? But hush—from this auspicious hour, The world, I ween, may rest in peace; And robb'd of darts, and stript of pow'r, Thy peevish petulance decrease. Sleep on, poor child! whilst I withdraw, And this thy vile artillery hide— When the Castalian fount she saw, And plung'd his arrows in the tide. That magic fount—ill-judging maid! Shall cause you soon to curse the day You dar'd the shafts of Love invade; And gave his arms redoubled sway. For, in a stream so wonderous clear, When angry Cupid searches round, Will not the radiant points appear? Will not the furtive spoils be found? Too soon they were; and every dart, Dipt in the Muse's mystic spring, Acquir'd new force to wound the heart; And taught at once to love and sing. Then farewell ye Pierian quire; For who will now your altars throng? From Love we learn to swell the lyre; And Echo asks no sweeter song. ODE. Written 1739. By the Same. Urit spes animi credula mutui. Hor. 'Twas not by beauty's aid alone. That love usurp'd his airy throne, His boasted power display'd: 'Tis kindness that secures his aim, 'Tis hope that feeds the kindling flame, Which beauty first convey'd. In Clara's eyes, the lightnings view; Her lips with all the rose's hue Have all its sweets combin'd; Yet vain the blush, and faint the fire, 'Till lips at once, and eyes conspire To prove the charmer kind— Tho' wit might gild the tempting snare, With softest accent, sweetest air, By Envy's self admir'd; If Lesbia's wit betray'd her scorn, In vain might every grace adorn, What every Muse inspir'd. Thus airy Strephon turn'd his lyre— He scorn'd the pangs of wild desire, Which love-sick swains endure: Resolv'd to brave the keenest dart; Since frowns could never wound his heart, And smiles—must ever cure. But ah! how false these maxims prove; How frail security from love, Experience hourly shows! Love can imagin'd smiles supply, On every charming lip and eye Eternal sweets bestows. In vain we trust the Fair-one's eyes; In vain the sage explores the skies, To learn from stars his fate: 'Till led by fancy wide astray, He finds no planet mark his way; Convinc'd and wise—too late. As partial to their words we prove; Then boldly join the lists of love, With towering hopes supply'd: So heroes, taught by doubtful shrines, Mistook their Deity's designs; Then took the field—and dy'd. The DYING KID. By the Same. Optima quæque dies miseris mortalibus ævi Prima fugit ? Virg. A tear bedews my Delia's eye, To think yon playful kid must die; From crystal spring, and flowery mead, Must, in his prime of life, recede! Erewhile, in sportive circles round She saw him wheel, and frisk, and bound; From rock to rock pursue his way, And, on the fearful margin, play. Pleas'd on his various freaks to dwell, She saw him climb my rustic cell; Thence eye my lawns with verdure bright, And seem all ravish'd at the sight. She tells with what delight he stood, To trace his features in the flood: Then skip'd aloof with quaint amaze; And then drew near, again to gaze. See tells me, how with eager speed He flew, to hear my vocal reed; And how, with critic face profound, And stedfast ear, devour'd the sound. His every frolic, light as air, Deserves the gentle Delia's care; And tears bedew her tender eye, To think the playful kid must die.— But knows my Delia, timely wise, How soon this blameless æra flies? While violence and craft succeed; Unfair design, and ruthless deed! Soon would the vine his wounds deplore, And yield her purple gifts no more; Ah soon, eras'd from every grove Were Delia's name, and Strephon's love. No more those bow'rs might Strephon see, Where first he fondly gaz'd on thee; No more those beds of flow'rets find, Which for thy charming brows he twin'd. Each wayward passion soon would tear His bosom, now so void of care; And, when they left his ebbing vein, What, but insipid age, remain? Then mourn not the decrees of fate, That gave his life so short a date; And I will join thy tenderest sighs, To think that youth so swiftly flies! LOVE SONGS, written between the Year 1737 and 1743. By the Same. SONG. I. [I told my nymph, I told her true] I told my nymph, I told her true, My fields were small, my flocks were few; While faltering accents spoke my fear, That Flavia might not prove sincere. Of crops destroy'd by vernal cold, And vagrant sheep that left my fold; Of these she heard, yet bore to hear; And is not Flavia then sincere? How chang'd by Fortune's fickle wind, The friends I lov'd became unkind, She heard, and shed a generous tear; And is not Flavia then sincere? How, if she deign'd my love to bless, My Flavia must not hope for dress; This too she heard, and smil'd to hear; And Flavia sure must be sincere. Go shear your flocks, ye jovial swains, Go reap the plenty of your plains; Despoil'd of all which you revere, I know my Flavia's love sincere. SONG II. The Landskip. How pleas'd within my native bowers Erewhile I pass'd the day! Was ever scene so deck'd with flowers? Were ever flowers so gay? How sweetly smil'd the hill, the vale, And all the landskip round! The river gliding down the dale! The hill with beeches crown'd! But now, when urg'd by tender woes I speed to meet my dear, That hill and stream my zeal oppose, And check my fond career. No more, since Daphne was my theme, Their wonted charms I see: That verdant hill, and silver stream, Divide my love and me. SONG III. [Ye gentle nymphs and generous dames] Ye gentle nymphs and generous dames That rule o'er every British mind; Be sure ye soothe their amorous flames, Be sure your laws are not unkind. For hard it is to wear their bloom In unremitting sighs away: To mourn the night's oppressive gloom, And faintly bless the rising day. And cruel 'twere a free-born swain, A British youth should vainly moan; Who scornful of a tyrant's chain, Submits to yours, and yours alone. Nor pointed spear, nor links of steel, Could e'er those gallant minds subdue, Who beauty's wounds with pleasure feel, And boast the fetters wrought by you. SONG IV. The Sky-Lark. Go, tuneful bird, that glad'st the skies, To Daphne's window speed thy way; And there on quivering pinions rise, And there thy vocal art display. And if she deign thy notes to hear, And if she praise thy matin song, Tell her the sounds that soothe her ear, To Damon's native plains belong. Tell her, in livelier plumes array'd, The bird from Indian groves may shine; But ask the lovely partial maid, What are his notes compar'd to thine? Then bid her treat yon witless beau, And all his flaunting race with scorn; And lend an ear to Damon's woe, Who sings her praise, and sings forlorn. SONG V. [On every tree, in every plain] Ah! ego non aliter tristes evincere morbos Optarim, quam te sic quoque velle putem. On every tree, in every plain, I trace the jovial spring in vain! A sickly languor veils mine eyes, And fast my waning vigor flies. Nor flow'ry plain, nor budding tree, That smile on others, smile on me; Mine eyes from death shall court repose, Nor shed a tear before they close. What bliss to me can seasons bring? Or what, the needless pride of spring? The cypress bough, that suits the bier, Retains its verdure all the year. 'Tis true, my vine so fresh and fair, Might claim awhile my wonted care; My rural store some pleasure yield; So white a flock, so green a field! My friends, that each in kindness vie, Might well expect one parting sigh; Might well demand one tender tear; For when was Damon unsincere? But ere I ask once more to view Yon setting sun his race renew, Inform me, swains; my friends, declare, Will pitying Delia join the prayer? SONG VI. The Attribute of Venus. Yes; Fulvia is like Venus fair; Has all her bloom, and shape and air: But still, to perfect every grace, She wants—the smile upon her face. The crown majestic Juno wore; And Cynthia's brow the crescent bore, An helmet mark'd Minerva's mien, But smiles distinguish'd Beauty's queen. Her train was form'd of smiles of loves Her chariot drawn by gentlest doves; And from her zone, the nymph may find, 'Tis Beauty's province to be kind. Then smile, my fair; and all whose aim Aspires to paint the Cyprian dame, Or bid her breathe in living stone, Shall take their forms from you alone. The Rape of the Trap, a Ballad; written at College, 1736. By the Same. 'Twas in a land of learning, The Muse's favourite station, Such pranks, of late, Were play'd by a rat, As gave them consternation! All in a college-study, Where books were in great plenty, This rat would devour More sense, in an hour, Than I could write—in twenty. His breakfast, half the morning, He constantly attended; And, when the bell rung For evening-song, His dinner scarce was ended. Huge tomes of geo—graphy, And maps lay all in flutter; A river or a sea Was to him a dish of tea, And a kingdom—bread and butter. Such havoc, spoil, and rapine, With grief my Muse rehearses; How freely he would dine On some bulky school-divine, And for desert—eat verses. He spar'd not ev'n heroics, On which we poets pride us: And would make no more Of King Arthurs, by the score, Than—all the world beside does. But if the desperate potion, Might chance to over-dose him; To check its rage, He took a page Of logic, to compose him. A trap in haste and anger, Was bought, you need not doubt on't; And such was the gin, Were a lion once in, He could not, I think, get out on't. With cheese, not books, 'twas baited; The fact, I'll not bely it; Since none, I tell ye that, Whether scholar or rat, Minds books, when he has other diet. No more of trap and bait, sir, Why should I sing—or either? Since the rat, with mickle pride, All their sophistry defy'd; And dragg'd them away together. Both trap and bait were vanish'd, Thro' a fracture in the flooring; Which, tho' so trim It now may seem, Had then a doz'n, or more in. Then answer this, ye sages; (Nor think I mean to wrong ye) Had the rat, who thus did seize on The trap, less claim to reason, Than many a sage among ye? Dan Prior's mice, I own it, Were vermin of condition; But the rat, who chiefly learn'd What rats alone concern'd, Was the deeper politician. That England's topsy-turvy, Is clear from these mishaps, sir, Since traps, we may determine, Will no longer take our vermin; But vermin take our traps, sir. Let sophs, by rats infested, Then trust in cats to catch 'em; Lest they prove the utter bane Of our studies, where, 'tis plain, No mortal sits—to watch 'em. A SIMILE. By the Same. What village but has often seen The clumsy shape, the frightful mien, Tremendous claws, and shagged hair, Of that grim brute, yclep'd a Bear? He from his dam, as wits agree, Receiv'd the curious form you see; Who with her plastic tongue alone Produc'd a visage like her own. By which they hint, in mystic fashion, The powerful force of education. Perhaps yon rural tribe is viewing, E'en now, the strange exploits of Bruin; Who plays his anticks, roars aloud, The wonder of a gaping crowd! So have I known an aukward lad, Whose birth has made a parish glad, Forbid, for fear of sense, to roam; And taught by kind mamma at home; Who gives him many a well-try'd rule, With ways and means—to play the fool. In sense the same, in stature higher, He shines, ere long, a rural squire; Pours forth unwitty jokes, and swears, And bawls and drinks—but chiefly stares! His tenants of superior sense Carouse and laugh at his expence; And sure the pastime I'm relating Must prove as pleasant as Bear-baiting. The CEREMONIAL. By the Same. “Sir, will you please to walk before?” No pray, Sir—you are next the door. “Upon mine honour, I'll not stir!” Sir, I'm at home; consider, Sir. “Excuse me Sir, I'll not go first.” Well, if I must be rude, I must; But yet I wish I cou'd evade it; 'Tis strangely clownish—be persuaded, &amp;c. &amp;c. —Go forward, cits! go forward, squires! Nor scruple each, what each admires. Life squares not, friends, with your proceeding: It flies, while you display your breeding; Such breeding as one's granam preaches, Or some old dancing-master teaches— O for some rude tumultuous fellow, Half crazy, or at least half-mellow, To come behind you, unawares, And fairly push you both down stairs! But Death's at hand—Let me advise ye, Go forward, friends—or he'll surprize ye. The Beau to the Virtuosos; alluding to a Proposal for the Publication of a Set of Butterflies. By the Same. Hail curious wights, to whom so fair The form of mortal flies is! Who deem those grubs beyond compare, Which common sense despises. Whether your prey, in gardens found, Be urg'd thro' walks and allies; Whether o'er hill, morass or mound, You make more desperate sallies; Amid the fury of the chace, No rocks could e'er retard you; Blest, if a fly repay the race, Or painted wing reward you. 'Twas thus See Virgil. Camilla, o'er the plain, Pursu'd the glittering stranger; Still ey'd the purple's pleasing stain, And knew not fear nor danger. 'Tis you dispense the fav'rite meat To nature's filmy people; Know what conserves they chuse to eat, And what liqueurs, to tipple. 'Tis you protect their pregnant hour; And when the birth's at hand, Exerting your obstetric pow'r, Prevent a mothless land. Yet oh! my friends! howe'er your view Above gross objects rises; Whate'er refinements you pursue, Hear what a beau advises. A beau, that, weigh'd with your's, must prize Domitian's idle passion; Who sought the death of teazing flies And not their propagation. Let ?'s eyes more deeply warm, Nor foolishly determine To slight fair Nature's loveliest form, And sigh for Nature's vermin. And speak with some respect of beaux; No more, as triflers, treat 'em: 'Tis better learn to save one's cloaths, Than cherish moths that eat 'em. VERSES to a FRIEND. Have you not seen, my gentle squire, The humours of our kitchin fire? Says Ned to Sal—I lead a spade; Why don't ye play?—the girl's afraid— Play something—any thing—but play— 'Tis but to pass the time away. Pho! how she stands—biting her nails— As tho' she play'd for half her vails— Sorting her cards, haggling and picking— We play for nothing, do us, chicken? That card will do—blood!—never doubt it— 'Tis not worth while to think, about it. Sal thought and thought, and miss'd her aim; And Ned, ne'er studying, won the game. Methinks, old friend, 'tis wond'rous true, That verse is but a game at Loo. While many a bard, that shews so clearly He writes for his amusement merely, Is known to study, fret, and toil, And play for nothing all the while; Or praise at most (for wreaths of yore Ne'er signify a farthing more:) Till having vainly toil'd to gain it, He sees your flying pen obtain it. Thro' fragrant scenes the trifler roves, And hallow'd haunts that Phœbus loves; Where with strange heats his bosom glows, And mystic flames the God bestows. You, who none other flame require Than a good blazing parlour fire, Write verses—to defy the scorners, In cake houses, and chimney corners. Sal found her deep-laid schemes were vain; The cards are cut—come deal again— No good comes on it when one lingers— I'll play the card comes next my fingers— Fortune could never let Ned loo her, When she had left it wholly to her. Well, now, who wins?—Why, still the same— For Sal has lost another game. I've done, she mutter'd—I was saying, It did not argufy my playing. Some folks will win they cannot chuse; But think or not think—some must lose. I may have won a game, or so— But then it was an age ago— It ne'er will be my lot again— I won it of a baby then— Give me an ace of trumps, and see, Our Ned will beat me with a three. 'Tis all by luck that things are carry'd— He'll suffer for it when he's marry'd. Thus Sal, with tears in either eye, While victor Ned sat tittering by. Thus I, long envying your success, And bent to write, and study less, Sate down and scribbled in a trice, Just what you see—and you despise. You who can frame a tuneful song, And hum it as you ride along; And, trotting on the king's high-way, Snatch from the hedge a sprig of bay; Accept the verse, howe'er it flows, From one, who is your friend in prose. What is this wreath, so green! so fair! Which many wish, and few must wear? Which one man's indolence can gain, Another's vigils ne'er obtain? For what must Sal or Poet sue, Ere they engage with Ned or you? For luck in verse? for luck at Loo? Ah no! 'tis Genius gives you fame, And Ned thro' skill secures the game. Written at an INN on a particular Occasion. To thee, fair Freedom! I retire, From flattery, feasting, dice, and din; Nor art thou found in domes much higher Than the low cot, or humble inn. 'Tis here with boundless power I reign, And every health which I begin, Converts dull port to bright champain; For Freedom crowns it at an inn. I fly from pomp, I fly from plate, I fly from Falshood's specious grin; Freedom I love, and form I hate, And chuse my lodgings at an inn. Here, waiter! take my sordid ore, Which lacqueys else might hope to win; It buys what courts have not in store, It buys me Freedom, at an inn. And now once more I shape my way Thro' rain or shine, thro' thick or thin, Secure to meet, at close of day, With kind reception—at an inn. Whoe'er has travell'd life's dull round, Where'er his various tour has been, May sigh to think how oft he found His warmest welcome—at an inn. The Price of an EQUIPAGE. Servum si potes, Ole, non habere Et regem potes, Ole, non habere Mar. I ask'd a friend, amidst the throng, Whose coach it was that trail'd along: “The gilded coach there—don't you mind? “That with the footmen stuck behind.” O Sir, says he, what ha'n't ye seen it? 'Tis Timon's coach, and Timon in it. 'Tis odd, methinks, you have forgot Your friend, your neighbour, and—what not? Your old acquaintance, Timon!—“True, “But faith his equipage is new. “Bless me, said I, where can it end? “What madness has possess'd my friend? “Four powder'd slaves, and those the tallest! “Their stomachs, doubtless, not the smallest! “Can Timon's revenue maintain “In lace and food, so large a train? “I know his land—each inch o' ground— “'Tis not a mile to walk it round— “And if his whole estate can bear “To keep a lad, and one-horse chair, “I own 'tis past my comprehension!”— Yes, Sir; but Timon has a pension. Thus does a false ambition rule us; Thus pomp delude, and folly fool us; To keep a race of flickering knaves, He grows himself the worst of slaves. A BALLAD. [From Lincoln to London rode forth our young squire] ? Trahit sua quemque voluptas. Virg. From Lincoln to London rode forth our young squire, To bring down a wife, whom the swains might admire: But, in spite of whatever the mortal could say, The goddess objected the length of the way! To give up the op'ra, the park and the ball, For to view the stag's horns in an old country hall: To have neither China nor India to see! Nor lace-man to plague in a morning—not she! To relinquish the play-house, Quin, Garrick, and Clive, Who by dint of mere humour had kept her alive; To forego the full box for his lonesome abode! O Heav'ns! she should faint, she should die on the road! To forget the gay fashions and gestures of France, And to leave dear Auguste in the midst of the dance; And Harlequin too!—'Twas in vain to require it— And she wonder'd how folks had the face to desire it! She might yield to resign the sweet singers of Ruckholt, Where the citizen-matron regales with her cuckold; But Ranelagh soon would her footsteps recall, And the music, the lamps, and the glare of Vaux-hall. To be sure she could breathe no where else than in town. Thus she talk'd like a wit, and he look'd like a clown: But while honest Harry despair'd to succeed, A coach with a coronet trail'd her to Tweed. The Extent of COOKERY. ? Aliusque et Idem. When Tom to Cambridge first was sent, A plain brown bob he wore; Read much, and look'd as tho' he meant To be a fop no more. See him to Lincoln's-Inn repair, His resolution flag; He cherishes a length of hair, And tucks it in a bag. Nor Coke nor Salkield he regards, But gets into the house; And soon a judge's rank rewards His pliant votes and bows. Adieu ye bobs! ye bags give place! Full-bottoms come instead! Good Lord! to see the various ways Of dressing—a Calve's head! The Progress of Advice. A common Case. ? Suade, nam certum est. Says Richard to Thomas (and seem'd half afraid) I am thinking to marry thy mistress's maid: Now because Mrs. Martha to thee is well known, I will do't if thou bidst me, or let it alone. Nay don't make a jest on't, 'tis no jest to me; For faith I'm in earnest, so prithee be free. I have no fault to find with the girl since I knew her; But I'd have thy advice, ere I tye myself to her. Said Thomas to Richard—to speak my opinion, There is not such a bitch in king George's dominion! And I firmly believe, if thou knew'st her as I do, Thou would'st chuse out a whipping-post, first, to be ty'd to. She's peevish, she's thievish, she's ugly, she's old, And a lyar, and a fool, and a slut, and a scold— Next day Richard hasten'd to church and was wed, And ere night had inform'd her what Thomas had said. SLENDER's GHOST. ? Curæ leves loquuntur, ingentes stupent. Beneath a church-yard yew Decay'd and worn with age, At dusk of eve, methought I spy'd Poor Slender's ghost, that whimpering cry'd, O sweet, O sweet Anne Page! Ye gentle bards, give ear! Who talk of amorous rage, Who spoil the lily, rob the rose; Come learn of me to weep your woes: O sweet! O sweet Anne Page! Why should such labour'd strains Your formal Muse engage? I never dreamt of flame or dart, That fir'd my breast, or pierc'd my heart, But sigh'd, O sweet Anne Page! And you, whose love-sick minds No medicine can assuage! Accuse the leech's art no more, But learn of Slender to deplore; O sweet! O sweet Anne Page! And you, whose souls are held, Like linnets, in a cage! Who talk of fetters, links, and chains, Attend, and imitate my strains: O sweet! O sweet Anne Page! And you, who boast or grieve, What horrid wars ye wage! Of wounds receiv'd from many an eye, Yet mean as I do when I sigh O sweet! O sweet Anne Page! Hence every fond conceit Of shepherd, or of sage! 'Tis Slender's voice, 'tis Slender's way, Expresses all you have to say— O sweet! O sweet Anne Page! Upon RIDDLES. Have you not known a small machine Which brazen rings environ, In many a country chimney seen, Y-clep'd a tarring-iron? Its puzzling nature to display Each idle clown may try, Sir, Tho, when he has acquir'd the way, He's not a jot the wiser. 'Tis thus with him, who fond of rhime In Wit's low species piddles; And tires his thoughts, and wastes his time In explicating riddles. Shall idle bards, by fancy led, (With wrathful zeal I speak it) Write with design to plague my head, Who have no right to break it? He writes the best, who, writing, can Both please and teach together: But 'tis the devil of a plan, That can accomplish neither. Ye readers, hear! ye writers too! O spare your darkling labours! For, tho' they please, not profit, you, They plague and hurt your neighbours. Go learn of Pope; then judge aright, Which way to Fame's the surer; To put the truth in fairest light, Or render it obscurer. VERSES to a Writer of RIDDLES. Ah! boast not those obscuring lays, Nor think it sure and certain That every one can draw a face, Who can produce a curtain. Pope does the flourish'd truth no hurt, While graceful flowers disguise it; Thou daub'st it so with mud and dirt, That not a soul espies it. His fancy decks, thy fancy shrowds; What likeness is between 'em? 'Twixt one who soars above the clouds, And one entangled in 'em? But let my candour not upbraid Thy strains, which flow so purely; It is thy secret, 'tis thy trade, Thy craft—to write obscurely. Obscurity in thee to blame I've not the least pretence; 'Tis that alone can guard thy fame, The style that suits thy sense. When Nature forms an horrid mien Less fit for vulgar sight; The creature, fearful to be seen, Spontaneous shuns the light. The bat uncouth thro' instinct fears The prying eyes of day; Yet when the sun no more appears, Securely wings away. 'Tis instinct bids the frightful owl To devious glooms repair; And points out Riddles to a fool, To wrap his genius there. To ? By ANTHONY WHISTLER, Esq; Resolve me, Strephon, what is this, I think you cannot guess amiss. 'Tis the reverse of what you love, And all the men of sense approve. None of the Nine e'er gave it birth; The offspring first of foolish mirth, The nurs'ry's study, children's play, Inferior far to Namby's lay. What vacant Folly first admir'd, And then with emulation fir'd, Gravely to imitate, aspir'd. 'Tis opposite to all good writing, In each defect of this delighting. Obscurity its charms displays, And inconsistency, its praise. No gleam of sense to wake the soul, While clouds of nonsense round it roll. No smooth description to delight; No fire the passions to excite; Not joke enough to shake the pit: A jest obscene wou'd here be wit. What train of thought, tho' e'er so mean, Of black-shoe-boy or cynder-quean, But far out-shines Sir Fopling's mind While bent this secret charm to find! The greatest charm as yet remains, Best suited to the searcher's brains, That when he seems on it to fall, He finds there is no charm at all. Th'appearance, first, of Nothing's fine, To find it Nothing is divine! But Batho is the flow'r, to sink Below what mortal man can think— Well, now what is't?—what is't—a fiddle!— Yes, do be angry—'tis a Riddle. SONG. By the Same. [Let wisdom boast her mighty pow'r] Let wisdom boast her mighty pow'r, With passion still at strife, Yet love is sure the sov'reign flow'r, The sweet perfume of life. The happy breeze that swells the sail, When quite becalm'd we lie; The drop, that will the heart regale, And sparkle in thr eye. The sun that wakes us to delight, And drives the shades away; The dream that chears our dreary night, And makes a brighter day. But if, alas! it wrongly seize, The case is twice as bad; This flow'r, sun, drop, or dream, or brzeee, Will drive a blockhead mad. To Lady Fane on her Grotto at Basilden. 1746. By Mr. Graves. Glide smoothly on, thou silver Thames, Where Fane has fix'd her calm retreat; Go pour thy tributary streams, To lave imperial Thetis' feet. There when in flow'ry pride you come Amid the courtiers of the main, And join within the mossy dome Old Tiber, Arno, or the Seine; When each ambitious stream shall boast The glories of its flatter'd lords; What pomp adorns the Gallic coast, What Rome, or Tuscany affords. Then shalt thou speak, (and sure thy tale Must check each partial torrent's pride,) What scenes adorn this flow'ry vale, Thro' which thy happier currents glide. But when thy fond description tells The beauties of this grott divine: What miracles are wrought by shells, Where nicest taste and fancy join: Thy story shall the goddess move, To quit her empire of the main, Her throne of pearls, her coral grove, And live retir'd with Thee and Fane. The INVISIBLE. By the Same. What mortal burns not with the love of fame? Some write, some fight, some eat themselves a name. For some beau Frightful haunts each public place, And grows conspicious for—his ugly face. Laura, the rural circle's constant boast, Sighs for the Mall, nor sleeps till she's a toast. The priestling, proud of doctrine not his own, Usurps a scarf, and longs to preach in town. Ev'n Westley's saints, whose cant has fill'd the nation, Toil more for fame, I trow, than reformation. B?, tho' blest with learning, sense and wit, Yet prides himself in never shewing it. Safe in his cell, he shuns the staring crowd, And inward shines, like Sol behind a cloud. For fame let fops to distant regions roam, Lo! here's the man—who never stirs from home! That unseen wight, whom all men wish to see, Illustrious grown—by mere obscurity. The Pepper-box and Salt-seller. A Fable. To ? Esq; By the same. The 'squire had din'd alone one day, And Tom was call'd to take away: Tom clear'd the board with dextrous art: But, willing to secure a tart, The liquorish youth had made an halt; And left the pepper-box and salt Alone, upon the marble table: Who thus, like men, were heard to squabble. Pepper began, “Pray, Sir, says he, What business have you here with me? Is't fit that spices of my birth Should rank with thee, thou scum of earth? I'd have you know, Sir, I've a spirit Suited to my superior merit— Tho' now, confin'd within this castre, I serve a northern Gothic master; Yet born in Java's fragrant wood, To warm an eastern monarch's blood, The sun those rich perfections gave me, Which tempted Dutchmen to enslave me. Nor are my virtues Here unknown, Tho' old and wrinkled now I'm grown. Black as I am, the fairest maid Invokes my stimulating aid, To give her food the poignant flavour; And to each sauce, its proper savour. Pasties, ragouts and fricassees, Without my seasoning, fail to please: 'Tis I, like wit, must give a zest, And sprightliness, to every feast. Physicians too my use confess; My influence sagest matrons bless: When drams prove vain, and cholics teaze, To me they fly for certain ease. Nay I fresh vigour can dispense, And cure ev'n age and impotence: And, when of dulness wits complain, I brace the nerves, and clear the brain, But, to the 'squire here, I appeal— He knows my real value well: Who, with one pepper-corn content, Remits the vassal's annual rent— Hence then, Sir Brine, and keep your distance: Go lend the scullion your assistance; For culinary uses fit; To salt the meat upon the spit: Or just to keep our meat from stinking— And then—a special friend to drinking!” “Your folly moves me with surprize, (The silver tripod thus replies) Pray, master Pepper, why so hot? First cousin to the mustard-pot! What boots it how our life began? 'Tis breeding makes the gentleman. Yet would you search my pedigree, I rose like Venus from the sea: The sun, whose influence you boast, Nurs'd me upon the British coast. The chymists know my rank and place, When nature's principles they trace: And wisest moderns yield to me The elemental monarchy. By me all nature is supplied With all her beauty, all her pride! In vegetation, I ascend; To animals, their vigour lend; Corruption's foe, I life preserve, And stimulate each slacken'd nerve. I give jonquils their high perfume; The peach its flavour, rose its bloom: Nay, I'm the cause, when rightly trac'd, Of Pepper's aromatic taste. Such claims you teach me to produce; But need I plead my obvious use? In seasoning all terrestrial food? When heav'n declares, that salt is good. Grant then, some few thy virtues find; Yet salt gives health to all mankind: Physicians sure will side with me, While cooks alone shall plead for thee. In short, with all thine airs about thee, The world were happier far without thee.” The 'squire, who all this time sate mute, Now put an end to their dispute: He rung the bell—bade Tom convey The doughty disputants away— The salt, refresh'd by shaking up, At night did with his master sup: The pepper, Tom assign'd his lot With vinegar, and mustard-pot: A fop with bites and sharpers join'd, And, to the side-board, well confin'd! MORAL. Thus real genius is respected! Conceit and folly thus neglected! And, O my Shenstone! let the vain, With misbecoming pride, explain Their splendor, influence, wealth or birth; —'Tis men of sense are men of worth. Written near BATH. 1755. By the Same. ? Quæ tu deserta et inhospita tesqua Dicis, amœna vocat mecum qui sentit. Hor. I Each saucy cit, who strolls from town, With scorn surveys my gothic cell, Or wond'ring asks, what sordid clown In this drear solitude can dwell. II These mould'ring walls, with ivy crown'd, That charm me with their solemn scene, These flow'rs that bloom spontaneous round, Provoke his mirth, or raise his spleen. III Inur'd to smoke, throughout the year Yon verdant meads unmov'd he sees— Those hills unsightly rocks appear— You sacred groves, mere heaps of trees.— IV The lucid fount, that murmuring falls, Then thro' my shrubs meand'ring steals, An useful stream the insipid calls,— But no poetic rapture feels. V Hither from noisy crowds I fly; Here dwells soft ease, and peace of mind;— Yet think not Fancy's curious eye, To these deep solitudes confin'd. VI Whene'er at morn or eve I rove, Where yonder cliffs with pines are crown'd, More splendid scenes my rapture move; How charm'd I range th'horizon round. VII There Allen's stately columns rise, And glittering from the circling wood, With constant beauty feed my eyes, As he the poor with constant food. VIII Each pompous work, proud Bath! I share That decks thy hills.—Well-pleas'd I see Thy rising cirque eclipse thy square, And Pitt and Stanhope build for me. IX Here Bathurst's high aërial seat, There Seymour's lofty groves are seen; And Riggs's elegant retreat Adorns the variegated scene. X Would I fair Eden's bloom restore! Lo! Widcomb's cultivated vale, Where Flora paints her slopes for Moore, And all Arabia's sweets exhale. XI Luxurious thus I freely rove, Nor at the sons of wealth repine; Mere tenant of each hill and grove, Which sovereign Fancy renders mine. XII Familiar grown by constant use, The stateliest dome its master cloys— Then grant him but these transient views, What you possess, the bard enjoys. Verses to William Shenstone, Esq; On receiving a Gilt Pocket-Book. 1751. By Mr. JAGO. These spotless leaves, this neat array Might well invite your charming quill, In fair assemblage to display The power of learning, wit, and skill: But since you carelessly refuse, And to my pen the task assign; O! let your Genius guide my Muse, And every vulgar thought refine. Teach me your best, your best-lov'd art, With frugal care to store my mind; In this to play the miser's part, And give mean lucre to the wind: To shun the coxcomb's empty noise; To scorn the villain's artful mask; Nor trust gay pleasure's fleeting joys, Nor urge ambition's endless task. Teach me to stem youth's boisterous tide; To regulate its giddy rage; By reason's aid, my barque to guide Into the friendly port of age: To share what classic culture yields; Thro' rhetoric's painted meads to roam; With you to reap historic fields, And bring the golden harvest home: To taste the genuine sweets of wit; To quaff in humour's sprightly bowl; The philosophic mean to hit, And prize the dignity of soul. Teach me to read fair Nature's book, Wide-opening in each flowery plain; And with judicious eye to look On all the glories of her reign. To hail her seated on her throne; By aweful woods encompass'd round: Or her divine extraction own, Tho' with a wreath of rushes crown'd. Thro' arched walks, o'er spreading lawns, Near solemn rocks, with her to rove: Or court her, 'mid her gentle fauns, In mossy cell, or maple grove. Whether the prospect strain the sight, Or in the nearer landskips charm, Where hills, vales, fountains, woods unite, To grace our sweet Arcadian farm, There let me sit; and gaze with you, On Nature's works by Art refin'd; And own, while we their contest view, Both fair, but fairest, thus combin'd! The SWALLOWS. Written September, 1748. By the Same. [Part I.] Ere yellow Autumn from our plains retir'd, And gave to wintry storms the varied year, The Swallow-race, with foresight clear inspir'd, To Southern climes prepar'd their course to steer. On Damon's roof a grave assembly sate; His roof, a refuge to the feather'd kind; With serious look he mark'd the nice debate, And to his Delia thus address'd his mind. Observe yon twitt'ring flock, my gentle maid, Observe, and read the wond'rous ways of heav'n! With us thro' summer's genial reign they stay'd, And food, and lodging to their wants were giv'n. But now, thro' sacred prescience, well they know The near approach of elemental strife; The blustry tempest, and the chilling snow, With ev'ry want, and scourge of tender life! Thus taught, they meditate a speedy flight; For this, ev'n now they prune their vig'rous wing; For this, consult, advise, prepare, excite, And prove their strength in many an airy ring. No sorrow loads their breast, or swells their eye, To quit their friendly haunts, or native home; Nor fear they, launching on the boundless sky, In search of future settlements, to roam. They feel a pow'r, an impulse all divine! That warns them hence; they feel it, and obey; To this direction all their cares resign, Unknown their destin'd stage, unmark'd their way! Well fare your flight! ye mild domestic race! Oh! for your wings to travel with the sun! Health brace your nerves, and Zephyrs aid your pace, Till your long voyage happily be done! See, Delia, on my roof your guests to-day; To-morrow on my roof your guests no more! Ere yet 'tis night, with haste they wing away, To-morrow lands them on some safer shore. How just the moral in this scene convey'd! And what without a moral wou'd we read? Then mark what Damon tells his gentle maid, And with his lesson register the deed. 'Tis thus life's chearful seasons roll away; Thus threats the winter of inclement age; Our time of action but a summer's day; And earth's frail orb the sadly-varied stage! And does no pow'r its friendly aid dispense, Nor give us tidings of some happier clime? Find we no guide in gracious Providence Beyond the stroke of death, the verge of time! Yes, yes, the sacred oracles we hear, That point the path to realms of endless day: That bid our hearts, nor death, nor anguish fear, This future transport, that to life the way. Then let us timely for our flight prepare, And form the soul for her divine abode; Obey the call, and trust the Leader's care To bring us safe thro' Virtue's paths to God. Let no fond love for earth exact a sigh, No doubts divert our steddy steps aside; Nor let us long to live, nor dread to die; Heav'n is our Hope, and Providence our Guide. PART II. Written April, 1749. At length the winter's surly blasts are o'er; Array'd in smiles the lovely spring returns: Health to the breeze unbars the screaming door, And ev'ry breast with heat celestial burns. Again the daises peep, the violets blow, Again the tenants of the leafy grove Forgot the patt'ring hail, the driving snow, Resume the lay to melody and love. And see, my Delia, see o'er yonder stream, Where on the sunny bank the lambkins play, Alike attracted to th'enliv'ning gleam, The stranger-swallows take their wonted way. Welcome, ye gentle tribe, your sports pursue, Welcome again to Delia, and to me: Your peaceful councils on my roof renew, And plan your settlements from danger free. No tempest on my shed its fury pours, My frugal hearth no noxious blast supplies; Go, wand'rers, go, repair your sooty bow'rs, Think, on no hostile roof my chimnies rise. Again I'll listen to your grave debates, I'll think I hear your various maxims told, Your numbers, leaders, policies, and states, Your limits settled, and your tribes enroll'd. I'll think I hear you tell of distant lands, What insect-nations rise from Egypt's mud, What painted swarms subsist on Lybia's sands, What mild Euphrates yields, and Ganges' flood. Thrice happy race! whom Nature's call invites To travel o'er her realms with active wing, To taste her choicest stores, her best delights, The summer's radiance, and the sweets of spring. While we are doom'd to bear the restless change Of shifting seasons, vapours dank, or dry, Forbid, like you, to milder climes to range, When wintry clouds deform the troubled sky. But know the period to your joys assign'd! Know ruin hovers o'er this earthly ball; Certain as fate, and sudden as the wind, Its secret adamantine props shall fall. Yet when your short-liv'd summers shine no more, My patient mind, sworn foe to vice's way, Sustain'd on lighter wings than yours shall soar To fairer realms beneath a brighter ray. To plains etherial, and Elysian bowers, Where wintry storms no rude access obtain, Where blasts no light'ning, and no thunder low'rs, But spring, and joy unchang'd for ever reign. VALENTINE's Day. By the Same. The tuneful choir in amorous strains Accost their feather'd loves, While each fond mate with equal pains The tender suit approves. With chearful hop from spray to spray They sport along the meads; In social bliss together stray, Where love or fancy leads. Thro' spring's gay scenes each happy pair Their fluttering joys pursue; Its various charms and produce share, For ever kind and true. Their spritely notes from every shade Their mutual loves proclaim; Till winter's chilling blasts invade, And damp th'enlivening flame. Then all the jocund scene declines, Nor woods nor meads delight; The drooping tribe in secret pines, And mourns th'unwelcome sight. Go, blissful warblers! timely wise, Th'instructive moral tell! Nor thou their meaning lays despise, My charming Annabelle! The Scavengers. A Town Eclogue. In the Manner of Swift. By the Same. Awake my Muse, prepare a loftier theme: The winding valley and the dimpled stream Delight not all; quit, quit the verdant field, And try what dusty streets and alleys yield. Where Avon wider flows, and gathers fame, A town there stands, and Warwick is its name, For useful arts, entitled once to share The Mercian dame, Elfleda's guardian care. Nor less for feats of chivalry renown'd When her own Guy was with her laurels crown'd. Now indolence subjects the drowsy place, And binds in silken bonds her feeble race. No busy artisans their fellows greet, No loaded carriages obstruct the street; Scarce here and there a sauntring band is seen, And pavements dread the turf's incroaching green. Last of the toiling race there liv'd a pair, Bred up in labour, and inur'd to care, To sweep the streets their task from sun to sun, And seek the nastiness that others shun. More plodding hind, or dame, you ne'er shall see, He gaffer Pestel hight, and gammer she. As at their door they sate one summer's day, Old Pestel first essay'd the plaintive lay, His gentle mate the plaintive lay return'd, And thus alternately their grief they mourn'd. O. P. Alas! was ever such fine weather seen! How dusty are the roads, the streets how clean! How long, ye almanacks, will it be dry? Empty my cart how long, and idle I? Once other days, and diff'rent fate we knew, That something had to carry, I to do. Now e'en at best the times are none so good, But 'tis hard work to scrape a livelihood. The cattle in the stalls resign their life, And baulk the shambles, and the bloody knife. Th'affrighted farmer pensive sits at home, And turnpikes threaten to compleat my doom. Wife. Well! for the turnpike, that will do no hurt; The roads, they say, are n't much the better for't. But much I fear this murrain, where 'twill end, For sure the cattle did our door befriend. Oft have I prais'd them as they stalk'd along, Their fat the butchers pleas'd, but me their dung. O. P. See what a little dab of dirt is here! But yields all Warwick more, O tell me where? Lo! where this ant-like hillock scarce is seen, Heaps upon heaps, and loads on loads have been: Bigger and bigger the proud dunghill grew, 'Till my diminish'd house was hid from view. Wife. Ah! gaffer Pestel, what brave days were those, When higher than our house, our muck-hill rose? The growing mount I view'd with joyful eyes, And mark'd what each load added to its size. Wrapt in its fragrant steam we often sate, And to its praises held delightful chat. Nor did I e'er neglect my mite to pay, To swell the goodly heap from day to day; For this each morn I plied the stubbed-broom, 'Till I scarce hobbled o'er my furrow'd room: For this I squat me on my hams each night, And mingle profit sweet with sweet delight? A cabbage once I bought, but small the cost, Nor do I think the farthing all was lost: Again you sold its well digested store, To dung the garden where it grew before. O. P. What tho' the boys, and boy-like fellows jeer'd, And at the scavenger's employment sneer'd, Yet then at night content I told my gains, And thought well paid their malice and my pains. Why toils the merchant but to swell his store? Why craves the wealthy landlord still for more? Why will our gentry flatter, trade, and lie, Why pack the cards, and—what d'ye call't the die? All, all the pleasing paths of gain pursue, And wade thro' thick and thin, as we folk do. Sweet is the scent that from advantage springs, And nothing dirty that good interest brings. 'Tis this that cures the scandal, and the smell, The rest—e'en let our learned betters tell. Wife. When goody Dobbins call'd me filthy bear, And nam'd the kennel and the ducking chair: With patience I cou'd hear the scolding quean, For sure 'twas dirtiness that kept me clean. Clean was my gown on Sundays, tho' not fine, Nor mistress ?'s cap so white as mine. A slut in silk or kersey is the same, Nor sweetest always is the finest dame. Thus wail'd they pleasure past, and present cares, While the starv'd hog join'd his complaint to theirs. To still his grunting different ways they tend To West-gate one, and one to Cotton-end. HAMLET's Soliloquy, Imitated. By the Same. To print, or not to print—that is the question. Whether 'tis better in a trunk to bury The quirks and crotchets of outrageous Fancy, Or send a well-wrote copy to the press, And by disclosing, end them. To print, to doubt No more; and by one act to say we end The head-ach, and a thousand natural shocks Of scribbling frenzy—'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd. To print—to beam From the same shelf with Pope, in calf well bound: To sleep, perchance, with Quarles—Ay, there's the rub— For to what class a writer may be doom'd, When he hath shuffled off some paltry stuff, Must give us pause. There's the respect that makes Th'unwilling poet keep his piece nine years. For who would bear th'impatient thirst of fame, The pride of conscious merit, and 'bove all, The tedious importunity of friends, When as himself might his quietus make With a bare inkhorn? Who would fardles bear? To groan and sweat under a load of wit? But that the tread of steep Parnassus' hill, That undiscover'd country, with whose bays Few travellers return, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear to live unknown, Than run the hazard to be known, and damn'd. Thus critics do make cowards of us all. And thus the healthful face of many a poem Is sickly'd o'er with a pale manuscript; And enterprizers of great fire and spirit, With this regard from Dodsley turn away, And lose the name of Authors. Transcrib'd from the Rev. Mr. Pixel's Parsonage Garden near Birmingham, 1757. Seek not in these to view Dryads green, or Naiads blue; Such as haunt, at eve or dawn, Seat of the Earl of Stamford. Enville's lake, or Seat of lord Lyttelton. Hagley's lawn: Such as sport on Seat of Sherrington Davenport, Esq; Worfield's meads; Such as Shenstone's Genius leads O'er vale and hill, and to their care Consigns his waves and woodlands fair; While the Muses vacant stray, And Echo wants her sweetest lay. Long, long may those unrival'd shine, Nor shall my temp'rate breast repine, So Music lend her willing aid To gladden this ignoble shade; So Peace endear this humble plain— And haply Elegance will deign To wander here, and smiling see Her sister nymph Simplicity. MALVERN SPA, 1757. Inscribed to Dr. WALL. By the Rev. Mr. Perry. With bounteous hand the gracious King of heaven His choicest blessings to mankind hath given, Whilst thoughtless they ungratefully despise The rich profusion that salutes their eyes. But wise was he who study'd every use Of common weeds which common fields produce. The dock, the nettle, in each swelling vein, A healing balm for many an ill contain: See a pamphlet lately published by Mr. Gataker, where its virtues are with great candour and judgment display'd.Ev'n deadly nightshade, tho' with poison fraught, At length is found a salutary draught. The same creative power that first display'd His wond'rous works for our delight and aid; His love to mortal man still gracious shows, In ev'ry stream that glides, and herb that grows. At his command, Malvern, thy mountains rise, And catch their dewy nectar from the skies; At his command gush out thy crystal rills, To cure the direful train of human ills. On all alike their influence freely shed, As the bright orb that gilds thy mountain's head. The wealthy squire, whose gouty limbs are laid On beds of down, almost of down afraid, At this balsamic spring may soon regain His lavish'd health, and o'er the spacious plain Pursue the hare, or chace the miscreant fox With winged speed o'er hills or craggy rocks. Here to his comfort the poor helpless swain, Rack'd with the torture of rheumatic pain, Obtains relief without the nauseous pill, Or that more shocking sight the doctor's bill. When cloudy mists obscure the visual ray, And turn to dismal night the gladsome day; The mournful wretch with pleasure here may find A stream that heals the lame, and cures the blind. The pamper'd cit, whose high luxurious food With acrimonious poison loads his blood, Here polishes once more his scaly skin, And purifies the vital stream within. Amazing truth! his wretched leprous heir, Who undeserv'd his father's spots must wear, Emerges clean if in this fount he lave, As the white Syrian rose from Jordan's wave. The latent ulcer, and the cancer dire, That waste our flesh with slow consuming fire, Whose subtle flames still spread from part to part, And still elude the skilful surgeon's art; Here check'd submit, their raging fury laid, By streams from Nature's mystic engine play'd. The stubborn evil, for whose flux impure Blind bigotry at first devis'd a cure, Heal'd by these waters needs no more demand The foolish witchcraft of a Stuart's hand; And Brunswick's line may trust their royal cause To reason, justice, liberty, and laws. Should all the virtues of this spa be told, Its praises might be wrote in lines of gold. No more would poets their Pierian spring, But Malvern spa in loftier numbers sing; No more Parnassus, but the Malvern climb, To make their diction pure, their thoughts sublime. Ev'n I at these fair fountains eas'd of pain, To you, my friend, address one votive strain: To you the Naiad of this balmy well Reveals the wonders of her secret cell: To you transfers the lay, whose active mind, Like her own stream from See a treatise lately published by doctor Wall, concerning the extreme purity of the water, and its great efficacy in several obstinate chronical disorders. earthly dregs refin'd, Explores a panacea for mankind. Some Reflections upon hearing the Bell toll for the Death of a Friend. By Mr. J. G. Hark!—what a mournful solemn sound Rolls murm'ring thro' the cloudy air: It strikes the soul with awe profound, Affects the gay,—alarms the fair. With what a pathos does it speak! Affecting deep the thoughtful mind: The golden schemes of folly break, That hold in glittering snares mankind. 'Tis Death's dread herald calls aloud, Proclaims his conquest thro' the skies: The sun retires behind a cloud, And Nature seems to sympathize. Reflect, ye restless sons of care! Your vain designs his hand can spoil, Make hard oppressors lend an ear, And wretched misers cease their toil. For what avail vast heaps of gold, When Death his aweful writ shall send? Tho' folly swell, and pride look bold, The mask must drop, the farce must end. It is not hoary tottering age That now lies stretch'd beneath his stroke; The tyrant stern, that feels his rage: Th'oppressor's rod, that now is broke. But oh!—'tis generous Cynthio's bell! Fall'n in his prime of youthful bloom: For Cynthio sounds the doleful knell, And calls him to the silent tomb. Cynthio!—whose happy healing art Turn'd from his friends death's fatal blow, And shielded from that threatening dart, Which now, alas!—has laid him low. But Cynthio's virtues ne'er can die, They leave a grateful rich perfume: And now transplanted to the sky, In heav'n's immortal gardens bloom. And hark!—ah, what celestial notes, With grateful accents charm my ear! As down th'etherial music floats, The sun breaks forth, the skies are clear. From heav'n descends the joyful strain, Convey'd to earth on angels wings: To mitigate our grief and pain, And this the theme of joy it brings: “Thus write (the voice from heav'n proclaims) “The virtuous dead are ever blest! “Their works immortalize their names, “Their labours cease, and here they rest. “Behold, the Saviour wide display “The trophies of his gen'rous love, “To cheer you thro' life's thorny way, “And lead to flowery realms above. “'Tis He destroys Death's baneful sting, “And bids the grave's dread horrors fly, “The choirs of heav'n his triumph sing, “And hail him victor thro' the sky.” The ROBIN: An Elegy. Written at the close of Autumn, 1756. By the Same. O come, thou melancholy Muse, With solemn dirge assist my strain, While shades descend, and weeping dews, In sorrows wrap the rural plain. Her mantle grave cool Evening spreads, The Sun cuts short his joyful race; The jocund hills, the laughing meads, Put on a sickening, dying face. Stern Winter brings his gloomy train, Each pleasing landskip fades from view; In solemn state he shuts the scene, To flow'ry fields we bid adieu! Quite stript of every beauty, see How soon fair Nature's honours fade! The flowers are fled, each spreading tree No more affords a grateful shade. Their naked branches now behold, Bleak winds pierce thro' with murmuring sound; Chill'd by the northern breezes cold, Their leafy honours strew the ground. So man, who treads life's active stage, Like leaf or blossom fades away; In tender youth, or riper age, Drops thus, into his native clay! Alas! and can we chuse but moan, To see all Nature's charms expire! Fair-blooming Spring, gay Summer gone, And Autumn hastening to retire! But see the tender Redbreast comes, Forsaking now the leafless grove, Hops o'er my threshold, pecks my crumbs, And courts my hospitable love. Then sooths me with his plaintive tale As Sol withdraws his friendly ray; Cheering, as evening shades prevail, The soft remains of closing day. O welcome to my homely board! There unmolested shalt thou stand; Were it with choicest dainties stor'd, For thee I'd ope a liberal hand. Since thou, of all the warbling throng, Who now in silence far retire, Remain'st to sooth me with a song, And many a pleasing thought inspire. An EPITAPH. By the same. [If e'er sharp sorrow from thine eyes did flow] If e'er sharp sorrow from thine eyes did flow, If e'er thy bosom felt another's woe, If e'er fair beauty's charms thy heart did prove, If e'er the offspring of thy virtuous love Bloom'd to thy wish, or to thy soul was dear, This plaintive marble asks thee for a tear! For here, alas! too early snatch'd away, All that was lovely Death has made his prey. No more her cheeks with crimson roses vie, No more the diamond sparkles in her eye; Her breath no more its balmy sweets can boast, Alas! that breath with all its sweets is lost. Pale now those lips, where blushing rubies hung, And mute the charming music of her tongue! Ye virgins fair, your fading charms survey, She was whate'er your tender hearts can say; To her sweet memory for ever dear, Let the green turf receive your trickling tear. To this sad place your earliest garlands bring, And deck her grave with firstlings of the Spring. Let opening roses, drooping lillies tell, Like those she bloom'd, and ah! like these she fell. In circling wreaths let the pale ivy grow, And distant yews a sable shade bestow; Round her, ye Graces, constant vigils keep, And guard (fair Innocence!) her sacred sleep: Till that bright morn shall wake the beauteous clay, To bloom and sparkle in eternal day. UT PICTURA POESIS. By Mr. Nourse, late of All-Souls College Oxon, 1741. As once the Muse, reclining on her lyre, Observ'd her fav'rite bards, a num'rous choir; The conscious pleasure swell'd her silent breast, Her secret pride exulting smiles confest. When thus her sister spoke, whose care presides O'er the mixt pallat, and the pencil guides, Just, Goddess, is thy joy, thy train, we own, Approaches nearest to Apollo's throne. Foremost in Learning's ranks they sit sublime, Honour'd and lov'd thro' every age of time: Yet let me say, some fav'rite son of mine Has more than follow'd every son of thine. Thy Homer needs not grieve to hear his fame Exceeds not Raphael's widely honour'd name: Raphael like him 'midst ages wrapt in night, Rose father of his science to the light; With matchless grace, and majesty divine, Bade Painting breathe, and live the bold design; To the clay-man the heavenly fire apply'd, And gave it charms to Nature's self deny'd. With judgment, genius, industry and art, Does Virgil captivate his reader's heart? With rival talents my Caracci blest Fires with like transport the spectator's breast. The youthful Lucan, who with rapid force Urg'd by Pharsalia's field the Muse's horse, An equal fire, an equal strength of mind, In Angelo's congenial soul will find: Whose wild imagination could display Fierce giants whirl'd from heaven—the world's last day. With more success does tender Ovid move The melting soul to softness and to love; Than wanton Titian, whose warm colours shew That gods themselves the amorous riot know? Thy grandeur, Paulo, and thy happy stroke, I proudly own my emulation spoke, For I bestow'd them, that the world might see, A Horace too of mine arise in thee. Lo! where Poussin his magic colours spreads, Rise tower'd towns, rough rocks, and flow'ry meads: What leagues between those azure mountains lie, (Whose less'ning tops invade the purple sky) And this old oak, that shades this hollow way, Amidst whose windings sheep and oxen stray! 'Tis thus Theocritus his landskip gives, 'Tis thus the speaking picture moves and lives. Alike in Terence and in Guido's air, Our praise the height of art and nature share. In broader mirth if Plautus tread the stage, With equal humour Hemskirk's boors engage. She spoke, with friendly emulation stirr'd, And Phœbus from his throne with pleasure heard. The goddess of Indolence.VACUNA. By Mr. D?. Sceptre of ease! whose calm domain extends O'er the froze Chronian, or where lagging gales Fan to repose the Southern realms.

Serene approach, With forehead smooth, and sauntring gait; put on The smile unmeaning, or in sober mood Fix thy flat, musing, leaden eye: as looks Simplicius, when he stares and seems to think. Prompted by thee, Reservo keeps at home, Intent on books: he when alone applies The needle's reparation to his hose, Or studious slices paper.

Why should I speak Of coffee-house? or where the eunuch plays, Or Roscius in his buskin? These and more Thy crowded temples, where thou sit'st enshrin'd Glorious, thy incense ambergris, and time Thy sacrifice.—About thee cards and dice Lie scatter'd, and a thousand vassal beaux Officiate at thy worship.—Nor mean while Is solitude less thy peculiar sphere; There unattended you vouchsafe to shroud Your beauties, gentle Potentate; with me By vale or brook to loiter not displeas'd: Hear the stream's pebbled roar, and the sweet bee Humming her fairy-tunes, in praise of flowers; Or clam'rous rooks, on aged elm or oak, Aloft the cawing legislators sit, Debating, in full senate, points of state. My bower, my walks, my study all are thine, For thee my yews project their shade: my green Spreads her soft lap, my waters whisper sleep. Here thou may'st reign secure, nor hostile thought, Nor argument, nor logick's dire array Make inroad on thy kingdom's peace.—What tho' Malicious tongues me harmless represent, A traitor to thy throne: or that I hold Forbidden correspondence with the Nine, Plotting with Phœbus, and thy foes! What tho' Of satire they impeach me, strain severe! Thou know'st my innocence: 'tis true indeed I sometimes scribble, but 'tis thou inspir'st: In proof accept, O goddess, this my verse. On J.

What ken mine eyes, enchanted? man of ease, In elbow chair, and under brow of thought Intense, on some great matter fixt, no doubt: What mean the myrmidons on either hand In paper-coats, and orderly array, Spread far and wide, on table, desk, and stool, Variety of troops, white, purple, pied, And grey, and blue's battalion trim; and who In marbled regimentals, some in vest Gay edg'd with gold; of various garb, and tongue, And clime; extended o'er the wooden plain.

Not that thou want'st Th'offensive dart, 'till Satire's quiver fails.

Ye nymphs, that from Diana's sport retir'd, Yon forest leave awhile, and love to haunt The bord'ring vallies; saw ye, as they pass'd, A chosen pair, the glory of your plains, Array'd in youth's full bloom, and nature's prime? Saw ye the glance of beauty, when the fair, Quiver'd with charms, and by the Graees dress'd, March'd on: with joy the bridegroom flush'd, beyond What liveliest fancy, unpossess'd, can dream? Heard ye the music of the groves around Warbling, while choirs of gratulation rung From ev'ry spray; and nightingales, soft tun'd, In notes peculiar thrill'd the nuptial song! Such as in neighb'ring Windsor's fav'rite shade They chaunt; and, if their Handel's ear be true, No where on silence steal with lay so sweet. Auspicious omens brood on the fair hour! Did ever Hymen's look more fresh appear, Or his bright vest with deeper yellow flow? The vest that on occasions high and rare Pontifical he wears, when hearts sincere Combine; of healthy cheek, and sparkling eye As in the state of nature, ere his shafts By gold were blunted. How the blazing torch, Fann'd by love's pinion, sheds unusual fire! Lo! by the trail of light, he left behind, As from the shrine his jubilee return'd, The Muse, invited guest, attends her theme Right to the nuptial bow'r. There ent'ring, thrice She hemm'd, thrice blest the threshold with a sneeze, Prelude of happiness to come. Her lyre She strung,—a friendly, voluntary strain. “Hail (she began) distinguish'd pair! how fit To join in wedded love, each other's choice! Bridegroom, thy taste is elegant indeed, And fingers nice, that on some sunny bank In beauty's garden cull'd so fair a flow'r, To thine transplanted from her native soil. Cherish besure thy blooming charge; keep off Each blast unkind, and Zephyr's gale alone Blow there, and genial suns for ever smile. Who not applaud thy vow? hereafter who Dispute thy palate, judging and exact, Owner of curious bliss?—Nor thou, fair bride, Repine, nor homeward cast thy longing eye; 'Twas time to sever from the virgin choir. What joy in loneliness to waste the hours Unfruitful? see, hard by, Loddona's stream Cold and inactive creep along; her face Shaded with pensive willow,—till anon Married to jovial Thames, briskly she glides O'er many a laughing mead.—'Tis nature wills Such union: blest society! where souls Move, as in dance, to melody divine Fit partners. (How unlike the noisy broils Of wedded strife!) Hence friendship's gen'rous glow At love's high noon; and hence the sober flame Steady, as life declines.—All comforts hence Of child and parent, strongest, dearest ties! Think not the fair original design'd To flourish and be lost. The world expects Some copies to adorn another age.— Thank the kind gods; be happy, live and love. To a Gentleman, on the Birth-day of his first Son. By the Same. Thy sanguine hope compleated in a boy, Hymen's kind boon, my friend, I give thee joy. Of fine strange things, and miracles to be, Expect no flatt'ring prophecy from me. 'Tis Time's maturing bus'ness to call forth Degen'rate meanness, or transmitted worth: Under his sliding course of hours and days The artist's labour mellows or decays. Then, let me see, what my fond wish bespoke, The lively colouring, and manly stroke. Is there the sweetness, easiness, and grace, Maternal beauties, shed upon his face? Is there the frank benevolence; the fire Sincere and gen'rous, darted from his sire? The judging Muse, where lines like these must strike, Will eye the copy,—own,—'tis very like: Point out each virtue, each resemblance tell Pleas'd, that the parents drew themselves so well. On two Friends born on the same Day. By the Same. There are it seems who think the natal star Softens to peace, or animates to war; That yon bright orbs, as in their course they roll, Dart their strong influence on the dawning soul; Whether to empire led by shining Jove, Or lull'd to pleasure by the queen of love: Whether Mercurius gently wave his hand; And point to arts and sciences the wand; Or angry Mars inspiring warlike heat, Alarm the pulse, and at the bosom beat. If so: then why the Muse a contrast finds In Palamon's and Arcite's various minds? The one of nature easy and compos'd, Untoss'd by passion, and in arts repos'd; T'other of eager and impetuous soul, Starting in Honour's race, and stretching to the goal, One calm, like Theodosius, to desire; The other glowing with Varanes' fire: This pleas'd to wander in Pierian glades, Where the rill murmurs, and the laurel shades; That warm'd and rous'd by what his soul approves, The sport, the mistress, or the friend he loves. Yet the same sun saluted them on earth, Yet the same planets glitter'd at their birth, The same soft gale, or whisper'd in the wood, Or the same tempest discompos'd the flood. It is enough, that harmony appears, And friendship reconciles, where nature jars; For whatsoe'er the scheme of dreamers be, Their stars may differ, since their lives agree. A WINTER THOUGHT. By J. EARL. I The man whose constitution's strong, And free from vexing cares his mind, As changing seasons pass along Can in them all fresh pleasures find. II Not only in the teeming bud, The opening leaf, and following bloom, (Urg'd by the sap's ascending flood) And fruit fair knitting in its room; III Not only when the smiling fields In all their gaity appear, And the perfumes their bosom yields On balmy wings the zephyrs bear. IV In morning fair, in evening mild, The murm'ring brook, and cooling shade, Birds airy notes in consorts wild, And Philomela's serenade. V Not only in the waving ear, And branches bending with their load, Or whilst the produce of the year Is gathering, and in safety stow'd. VI He pleas'd, in days autumnal sees The shadowy leaf diversify'd With various colours, and the trees Stripp'd, and stand forth in naked pride. VII Each hollow blast, and hasty show'r, The rattling hail, and fleecy snow, The candy'd rime, and scatter'd hoar, And icicles which downward grow. VIII The shining pavement of the flood, To which the youthful tribes resort, And game, which the discover'd wood Exposes to the fowler's sport. IX The greens, which wintry blasts defy, Thro' native strength, or human care, In hedge, or close arrangery, All these a source of pleasure are. X The sun which from the northern signs Scorch'd with unsufferable heat, Now in a milder glory shines, And every glancing ray is sweet. XI The silver morn, and each fair star Forth to the best advantage shine, And by the richest scene prepare For noble thoughts th'enlarged mind. XII He, when the mornings slowest rise, Can sweetly pass the nights away In lucubration with the wise, Or conversation with the gay. XIII And when the winter tedious grows, And length'ning days cold stronger bring, A new increasing pleasure flows, From expectation of the spring. XIV So he whose faculties are sound, His heart upright and conscience clean, Agreeably can pass his round Of life, in ev'ry shifting scene. XV Not only in his youthful prime, And whilst his pow'rs continue firm, But when he feels th'effect of time, And age prepares him for the worm. XVI Grateful for every blessing past, Patient in every present ill; And on whatever ground he's plac'd, Hope does with pleasing prospects fill; XVII And faith in heav'n's enchanting love (From whence that Sun will soon appear Whose smiles make endless spring above) Does all his damps, and darkness clear, SONG. By the Same. [Stella and Flavia every hour] The attribution of this poem is questionable. Stella and Flavia every hour Do various hearts surprize; In Stella's soul lies all her power, And Flavia's in her eyes. More boundless Flavia's conquests are, And Stella's more confin'd; All can discern a face that's fair, But few a lovely mind. Stella, like Britain's monarchs, reigns O'er cultivated lands; Like eastern tyrants Flavia deigns To rule o'er barren sands. Then boast not, Flavia, thy fair face, Thy beauty's only store; Thy charms will every day decrease, Each day gives Stella more. VERSES spoken at Westminster School. J. F. How like you, Sir, the splendor of the day? What! has your lordship not a word to say? Can neither verse, nor prose your praises move? He sure dislikes who cares not to approve. You view with scorn our antiquated ways, Queen Bess's golden rules and golden days. No powder'd liveries attend us here, Hunger's our sauce, and mutton is our cheer. Our worn-out customs may provoke your sport, How long the graces, and the meals how short! Nor can our mouldy college-life afford A bed more fashionable than its board. No state-alcove, no wainscot can you see Of cedar old, or new mahogany: To us, poetic furniture is given, Curtains of night and canopy of heaven: Our youths, whom well-bred gentlemen despise, Sleep with the lamb, as with the lark they rise. Nay, prayers each day (strange things to modern beaux) Open our morning, and our evening close: Nor yet content with what at home we do, Our laws present us to the publick view; We to the Abbey march in white array Thrice every week, beside each holy day. What boys of rank cou'd brook such hard commands? Like meanest choristers to take their stands, Or penitents, with tapers in their hands? But these objections nobles may disown, Who seldom stoop to wear the daggled gown: The school itself unmannerly they call, Like death a general leveller of all; Which ne'er regards the priv'lege of a peer, What race you spring from, or what arms you bear. Boys on themselves, not ancestors, rely, Distinguish'd by intrinsic quality: A saucy commoner may take his place, Who is a lord, and is to be his grace. Not so at home—there due distinction's made, And full obeisance to degree is paid: Far milder treatment does his honour meet, From handmaid gentle, and from sister sweet: With footmen romps (which finely must improve him) And kiss his cousins that his aunts may love him. There the whole kindred join to form an heir, And uncles, grandsires, grandmothers are there: But oh! th'enchanting blessings who can shew, Which from the kennel, and the stable flow! When honour quits the closet for the fields, And all the student to the sportsman yields. Perhaps some glorious hunting-match design'd, E'en now, tho' absent, rises to your mind; If not prevented by this luckless day, How had you scower'd o'er hills and dales away, By foxes murder'd glory to obtain, And boast three vixens in a fortnight slain! Or had the generous stag with winged speed Across whole countries urg'd the straining steed, Each Yorkshire Riding might have view'd the race; Your horn perhaps had rung thro' Chevy-Chace. More cou'd I say— Lord C. —But hold, 'tis time you end, Who for a renegade mistake a friend. And cou'd you think one son so void of grace, T'abjure his Alma Mater to her face? How shou'd not she with irony dispense, Who lends us figures to adorn our sense? Why, 'tis to gain her smiles our parts we prove, To shew our genius is to shew our love: And you the judges, since yourselves inspire, Or our pacific or prolific fire, Be candid, and absolve the general aim, We argue different, but we think the same. Parents, when fondess, or the fashion sway, Will breed their child themselves, the modern way: No pedant schemes, that abject minds controul, Shou'd thwart the native freedom of his soul: Him their own eye o'erlooks, own modes refine, And master's powder'd ev'ry day to dine. As for his pretty head, mamma takes care The comb's well fix'd, and nicely curl'd the hair, And not one thing, I'll warrant you, breeds there. E'en let the dirty boys, so doom'd, be fools, And walk thro' thick and thin to crowded schools, Lest such rude noise shou'd hurt his tender brain, In his own hall Sir Timothy they train. Moll tells him stories while she sweeps the room, And he imbibes his morals from the groom. At twelve years old the sprightly youth is able To turn a pancake, or dry-rub a table. Soon as the clerk has taught him all he can, They send to London for some abler man. Down comes a Frenchman: Sire, me swear and vow, Me be surpriz'd you make no better bow: But will make you un brave scholar, no fear, Better den my own self, in two, tree year. The knight begins, and in a literal sense, Turns French to English, and makes Latin French. Three years my lady mother has the joy To hear the Frenchman and to see the boy; To her it is a comfort (above all) That Tim should learn so fast, and grow so tall. Kitty, my lady's waiting maid, was sister To Tom the groom, who knew the knight had kiss'd her; Tom manages his knight at such a rate, He beats the Frenchman, and he marries Kate. So fondly the wise mother lov'd the child, She quite undid him, lest he shou'd be spoil'd. This news the widow of the neighb'ring grange Heard with surprize—But I, said she, will change This unsuccessful method, and my Jerry, I'll answer for't, shall never thus miscarry. Prate with the maid! No—him I'll breed up shyly, And every servant shall respect him highly. No trifling monsieur here shall give advice; I'll have some senior-fellow, grave and wise, From either of our universities. She said—'Tis done—The honest man with pains Gender and number, mood and tense explains; Jerry goes thro' his daily task and thrives, From in speech be to th'apple-tree arrives. Then studious reads what Belgian authors writ, And drains whole nomenclators for their wit: From thence apace he grows accomplish'd fully, Has read Corderius, and has heard of Tully. Shou'd Oxford next, or Paris be his chance? The last prevails, and he's equip'd for France. He goes—sees every thing that rare and new is, And hunts like any alderman, with Lewis; Till some great fortune, or mamma's command, Again restores him to the British strand, Then, welcome Sir, to bless your native land. But see the proper vacancy present, And up he comes full fraught for parliament. Then first his noble heart begins to sink, Fain would he speak, but knows not how to think: Howe'er he'll needs launch out beyond his reach, Fer who ne'er made a theme, makes no good speech. Hence the loud laugh, and scornful sneer arise, Hence round and round the piquant raill'ry flies, And thus (sad shame) tho' now he's twenty-four, He's finely lash'd that ne'er was lash'd before. While each mean time, or commoner or peer, Who pass'd the discipline in practice here, Convinc'd applauds the doctor's wholsome plan, Who made the youngster smart to save the man. For what tho' some the good old man desert, Grow learn'd with ease, and grasp the shade of art, For us, we foster here no vain pretence, Nor fill with empty pride the void of sense; We rise with pains, nor think the labour light To speak like Romans, and like Romans write. 'Tis ours to court with care the learned throng, To catch their spirit as we gain their tongue; To enjoy the charms in Cæsar's works that shine, And learn to glow at Virgil's lofty line. 'Twas thus you mov'd, and thus in riper years, With such superior lustre fill your spheres; 'Twas thus you learn'd to rise, nor can you blame If as we tread your steps we hope your fame. And oh! may Westminster for ever view Sons after sons succeed, and all like you; May every doubt your great examples clear, And Education fix her empire here. A LETTER to Sir Robert Walpole. By the late HENRY FIELDING, Esq; Sir, While at the helm of state you ride, Our nation's envy and its pride; While foreign courts with wonder gaze, And justly all your counsels praise, Which, in contempt of faction's force, Steer, tho' oppos'd, a steady course, Wou'd you not wonder, Sir, to view Your bard a greater man than you? And yet the sequel proves it true. You know, Sir, certain ancient fellows Philosophers, and others tell us, That no alliance e'er between Greatness and happiness is seen; If so, may heaven still deny To you, to be as great as I. Besides, we're taught, it does behove us, To think those greater who're above us: Another instance of my glory, Who live above you twice two story, And from my garret can look down, As from an hill, on half the town. Greatness by poets still is painted, With many followers acquainted: This too does in my favour speak, Your levée is but twice a week, From mine I can exclude but one day; My door is quiet on a Sunday. The distance too at which they bow, Does my superior greatness shew. Familiar you to admiration, May be approach'd by all the nation, While I, like Great Mogul in Indo, Am never seen but at a window. The family that dines the latest, Is in our street esteem'd the greatest, But greater him we surely call, Who hardly deigns to dine at all. If with my greatness you're offended, The fault is easily amended: You have it, Sir, within your power To take your humble servant lower. An EPISTLE from the Elector of Bavaria to the French King, after the Battle of Ramillies. If yet, great Sir, your heart can comfort know, And the returning sighs less frequent flow; If yet your ear can suffer Anna's fame, And bear, without a start, her Marlbro's name; If half the slain o'er wide Ramillia spread, Are yet forgot, and in your fancy dead: Attend, and be yourself, while I recite (Oh! that I only can of losses write!) To what a mighty sum our ills amount, And give a faithful, tho' a sad account. Let not Bavaria be condemn'd unheard, Nor, 'till examin'd, have his conduct clear'd; Charge not on me alone that fatal day, Your own commanders bore too great a sway. Think! Sir, with pity think! what I have lost, My native realms and my paternal coast, All that a firm confed'rate could bestow, Ev'n faith and fame, if you believe the foe. Think what a heavy load o'erwhelms my breast, With its own sorrows and with yours opprest; After one battle lost, and country gone, Vanquish'd again, alas! and twice undone. Oh! where shall I begin? what language find To heal the raging anguish of your mind? Or if you deign a willing ear to lend, Oh! where will my disastrous story end? Conquest I often promis'd, I confess, And who from such a pow'r could promise less? There Gallia's force, and here Bavaria's shines, Th'experienc'd houshold fills our crowded lines; Already had our tow'ring thoughts o'erthrown The Belgian host, while we survey'd our own, Destroy'd their provinces with sword and flame, Let in their seas, and sack'd their Amsterdam; Already had we shar'd the fancy'd spoil, (Imaginary trophies crown'd our toil) Batavian standards to this temple gave, In that the British crosses doom'd to wave, A rural seat assign'd each captive chief, In that the British crosses doom'd to wave, A rural seat assign'd each captive chief, In flow'ry gardens to assuage his grief, And by his arts, and first escape prepar'd, On Marlbro had bestow'd a double guard. Paris impatient for the conquer'd foe, Hasten'd the tuneful hymn and solemn show; Triumphal chariots for the victor stay'd, And finish'd arches cast a pompous shade; With nicest art the bards had dress'd their lays, Of nothing fearful but to reach our praise; But all our hopes and expectation crost, What lines have we? what fame has Boileau lost? Your army now, fixt on its high designs, Rush forth like vernal swarms, and quit their lines; Eager the Dyle they pass to seek the fight, Judoina's fields with sudden tents are white, The foe descends, like torrents from the hills, And all the neighb'ring vale tumultuous fills: Preluding cannons tell th'approaching storm, And working armies take a dreadful form. Soon your victorious arms, and stronger force, Tore all the left, and broke the Belgian horse; Their scatter'd troops are rally'd to the fight, But only rally'd for a second flight: As when high heav'n on some aspiring wood, Which in close ranks, and thickest order stood, Pours its collected stores of vengeance down, Cedars are seen with firs and oaks o'erthrown, Long ravages and intervals of waste! So gor'd their lines appear'd, and so defac'd. The third attack had ended all the war, Sunk their whole force, and sav'd your future care, Had Marlbro, only Marlbro, not been there. As some good genius flies, to save the realms Which, in his absence born, a plague o'erwhelms, Through op'ning squadrons did the hero haste, And rais'd their drooping courage as he past. Amidst the routed Belgians he arriv'd, Turn'd the pursuit, the fainting fight reviv'd, Supply'd each rank, fill'd ev'ry vacant space, And brought the battle to its former face. With trembling hearts we see our fate decreed; Where Marlbro fights how can a foe succeed? To reach his life our boldest warriors strive, On him the storm with all its thunder drive; He stems the war, and half encompass'd round Still clears his way, and still maintains his ground: Amaz'd I saw him in such dangers live, And envy'd him the death I wish'd to give. But how our rising pleasure shall I tell? The thund'ring steed, and the great rider, fell: We thank'd kind heav'n, and hop'd the victor slain, But all our hopes, and all our thanks were vain: Free from the guilt of any hostile wound Alive he lay, and dreadful on the ground. As when a lion in the toils is cast, That uncontroul'd had laid the country waste, Th'insulting hinds surround him, who before Fled from his haunts, and trembled at his roar; So round beset the mighty Briton lies, And vulgar foes attempt the glorious prize. 'Till fresh battalions to his succour brought, Contending armies for the hero fought; The wanted steed some friendly hand prepar'd, And met a fatal, but a great, reward: A glorious death; of his lov'd lord bereft, The pious office unperform'd he left. The rescu'd chief, by the past danger warm'd, Our weaken'd houshold with new fury storm'd: While all around to our admiring eyes Fresh foes, and undiscover'd squadrons, rise. The boasted guards that spread your name so far, And turn'd where'er they fought the doubtful war, With heaps of slaughter strow'd the fatal plain, And did a thousand glorious things in vain; Broke with unequal force such numbers die, That I myself rejoic'd to see them fly. But oh! how few preserv'd themselves by flight? Or found a shelter from th'approaching night? Thousands fall undistinguish'd in the dark, And five whole leagues with wide destruction mark. Scarce at Ramillia did the slaughter end, When the swift victor had approach'd Ostend; Took in whole states and countries in his way, Brussels, nor Ghent, nor Antwerp gain'd a day; Within the compass of one circling moon, The Lis, the Demer, and the Scheld his own. What in the foe's, and what in William's hand, Did for an age the power of France withstand; Tho' each campaign she crowded nations drain'd, And the fat soil with blood of thousands stain'd; Those forts and provinces does Marlbro gain In twice three suns, and not a soldier slain; None can suspend the fortune of their town, But who their harvest and their country drown; Compell'd to call (his valour to evade) The less destructive ocean to their aid. Oh! were our loss to Flandria's plains confin'd! But what a train of ills are still behind! Beyond the Adige Vendome feels the blow, And Villars now retires without a foe, The fate of Flanders spreads in Spain the flame, And their new monarch robs of half his fame; But France shall hear, in some late distant reign, An unborn Lewis curse Ramillia's plain. Whither, oh! whither shall Bavaria run? Or where himself, or where the victor shun? Shall I no more with vain ambition roam, But my own subjects rule in peace at home? Thence an abandon'd fugitive I'm driven, Like the first guilty man by angry heav'n From his bless'd mansions, where th'avenging lord Still guards the passage with a brandish'd sword. Or shall I to Brabantia's courts retire, And reign o'er distant provinces for hire? Shall I with borrow'd government dispense, A royal servant and another's prince? These countries too (oh my hard fate!) are lost, And I am banish'd from a foreign coast; Now may I sight secure of future toils, Of no new countries a third battle spoils. Oh, Tallard! once I did thy chains deplore, But envy now the fate I mourn'd before; By bondage bless'd, protected by the foe, You live contented with one overthrow; Her captive, Britain kindly kept away From the disgrace of the last fatal day. How does my fall the haughty victor raise, And join divided nations in his praise; Grateful Germania unknown titles frames, And Churchill writes amongst her sov'reign names. Part of her states obey a British lord, Small part! of the great empire he restor'd. From the proud Spaniard he extorts applause, And rivals with the Dutch their great Nassaus. In ev'ry language are his battles known, The Swede and Pole for his, despise their own. A thousand sects in him their safety place, And our own saints are thank'd for our disgrace. England alone, and that some pleasure gives, Envies herself the blessings she receives. My grief each place renews where-e'er I go, And ev'ry art contributes to my woe; Ramillia's plain each painter's pencil yields, Bavaria flies in all their canvas fields: On me, young poets their rude lays indite, And on my sorrows practise how to write; I in their scenes with borrow'd passion rage, And act a shameful part on ev'ry stage. In Flandria will the tale be ever told, Nor will it grow, with ever telling, old: The lisping infants will their Marlbro raise, And their new speech grow plainer in his praise; His story will employ their middle years, And in their latest age recall their fears, While to their children's children they relate The business of a day, their country's fate: Then lead them forth, their thoughts to entertain, And shew the wond'ring youth Ramillia's plain; 'Twas here they fought, the houshold fled that way, And this the spot where Marlbro prostrate lay. Here they, perhaps, shall add Bavaria's name, Censure his courage, and his conduct blame: 'Tis false, 'tis false, I did not basely yield, I left indeed, but left a bloody field: Believe not, future ages, ne'er believe The vile aspersions which these wretches give; If you too far my injur'd honour try, Take heed, my ghost, it will, it shall, be nigh, Rise in his face, and give the slave the lie. Why should the stars thus on Britannia smile, And partial blessings crown the fav'rite isle? Holland does her for their great founder own; Britannia gave to Portugal a crown: Twice by her queens does proud Iberia fall; Her Edwards and her Henrys conquer'd Gaal: The Swede her arms from late oppression freed, And if he dares oppress, will curb the Swede. She, from herself, decides her neighbours fates, Rescues by turns, by turns subdues their states; In the wide globe no part could nature stretch Beyond her arms, and out of Britain's reach: Who fear'd, she e'er could have Bavaria seen? Such realms, and kingdoms, hills, and seas between? Yet there,—oh sad remembrance of my woe! Distant Bavaria does her triumphs show. Proud state! must Europe lie at thy command, No prince without thee rise, without thee stand! What share? what part is thine of all the spoil? Thine only is the hazard and the toil. An empire thou hast sav'd and all its states, Iberia's realms have felt severer fates: What wou'dst thou more? still do thy arms advance? Heav'n knows what doom thou hast reserv'd for France! From whose wise care does all the treasure rife, That slaughter'd hosts and shatter'd fleets supplies? From whence such boundless conquest does she reap, Purchas'd with all her boasted millions cheap? O bless'd! oh envy'd Queen! that does command At such a time, in such a happy land; Great in her armies and her pow'rful fleet! Great in her treasures! in her triumphs great! But greater still! and what we envy most, That can a Marlbro for her subject boast! Oh, Gallia! from what splendors art thou hurl'd? The terror once of all the western world; Thy spreading map each year did larger grow, New mountains still did rise, new rivers flow; But now surrounded by thy ancient mounds, Dost inward shrink from thy new-conquer'd bounds. Why did not nature, far from Marlbro's worth, In distant ages bring her Louis forth? Each uncontroul'd had conquer'd worlds alone, Happy, for Europe, they together shone. Cease! Louis, cease! from wars and slaughter cease! Oh! sue at last, 'tis time to sue, for peace! Urge not too far your twice unhappy fate, Nor Marlbro's stronger arm confess too late: Who never camps nor rough encounters saw, Can no just image of the hero draw: He must, alas! that Marlbro truly knows, Face him in battle, and whole armies lose. Believe me, Sir, on my unwilling breast, Fate has his virtues one by one imprest: With what a force our Schellemberg he storm'd? And Blenheim's battle with what conduct form'd? How great his vigilance; how quick his thought; What his contempt of death, Ramillia taught. These nature cool for peace and counsel forms, For battle those with rage and fury warms; But to her fav'rite Britain does impart The coolest head at once and warmest heart; So does Sicilia's lofty mountains show Flames in her bosom, on her head the snow. My youth with flatt'ring smiles did Fortune crown, The more severely on my age to frown? Of Pleasure's endless stores I drank my fill, Officious Nature waited on my will; The Austrian rescu'd, and the Turk o'erthrown, Europe and Asia fill'd with my renown: Blasted are all my glories and my fame, Lost is my country and illustrious name; The titles from their present lord are torn, Which my great ancestors so long had borne; No native honours shall my offspring grace, The last elector with a num'rous race. Half my unhappy subjects lost by wars, The rest for a worse fate the victor spares: Were they for this entrusted to my care? This the reward the brave, the faithful share? My sons lament, in distant dungeons thrown, Unacted crimes, and follies not their own; But oh! my comfort!—my o'er-flowing eyes Gush forth with tears, and all my sorrows rise, While the dear tender exile I bemoan; Oh royal bride! oh daughter of a throne! Not thus I promis'd when I sought thy bed, Thou didst the brave, the great Bavaria wed: Curst be ambition! curst the thirst of pow'r! And curst that once-lov'd title Emperor! Excuse, great Sir, the ravings of a mind, That can so just a cause for sorrow find; My words too rudely may a monarch greet, For oh! was ever grief like mine discreet! No suff'rings shall my firm alliance end, An unsuccessful, but a faithful friend. To the Duke of MARLBOROUGH Pardon, great Duke, if Britain's stile delights; Or if th'Imperial title more invites; Pardon, great Prince, the failings of a Muse, That dares not hope for more than your excuse, Forc'd at a distance to attempt your praise, And sing your victories in mournful lays, To cast in shadows, and allay the light, That wounds, with nearer rays, the dazled sight, Nor durst in a direct and open strain Such acts, with her unhallow'd notes, prophane: In tow'ring verse let meaner heroes grow, And to elab'rate lines their greatness owe, Your actions, own'd by ev'ry nation, want Praises, no greater than a foe may grant. Oh! when shall Europe, by her Marlbro's sword, To lasting peace and liberty restor'd, Allow her weary champion a retreat, To his lov'd country and his rising seat? Where your soft partner, far from martial noise, Your cares shall sweeten with domestic joys: Your conquests she with doubtful pleasure hears, And in the midst of ev'ry triumph fears; Betwixt her queen and you divides her life, A friend obsequious, and a faithful wife. Hail Woodstock! hail ye celebrated glades! Grow fast ye woods, and flourish thick ye shades! Ye rising tow'rs for your new lord prepare, Like your old Henry come from Gallia's war. The gen'ral's arms as far the king's o'erpow'r, As this new structure does surpass the bow'r. The pleasing prospects and romantic scite, The spacious compass, and the stately height; The painted gardens, in their flow'r prime, Demand whole volumes of immortal rhime, And if the Muse would second the design, Mean as they are, should in my numbers shine, There live, the joy and wonder of our isles, Happy in Albion's love, and Anna's smiles. While from the godlike race of Churchill born, Four beauteous Rosamonds this bow'r adorn, Who with the ancient syren of the place In charms might vie, and ev'ry blooming grace; But bless'd with equal virtues had she been, Like them she had been favour'd by the Queen, Whom your high merit, and their own, prefers To all the worthiest beds of England's peers. Thus the great eagle, when heav'n's wars are o'er, And the loud thunder has forgot to roar, Jove's sires laid by, with those of Venus burns, To his forsaken mate and shades returns; On some proud tree, more sacred than the rest, With curious art he builds his spacious nest; In the warm sun lies basking all the day, While round their sire the gen'rous eaglets play; Their sire, well-pleas'd to see the noble brood Fill all the loftiest cedars of the wood. An ODE on Miss Harriet Hanbury at Six Years old. By Sir Charles Hanbury Williams. I Why shou'd I thus employ my time, To paint those cheeks of rosy hue? Why shou'd I search my brains for rhime, To sing those eyes of glossy blue? II The pow'r as yet is all in vain, Thy num'rous charms, and various graces: They only serve to banish pain, And light up joy in parents' faces. III But soon those eyes their strength shall feel; Those charms their pow'rful sway shall find: Youth shall in crowds before you kneel, And own your empire o'er mankind. IV Then when on Beauty's throne you sit, And thousands court your wish'd-for arms; My Muse shall stretch her utmost wit, To sing the victories of your charms. V Charms that in time shall ne'er be lost, At least while verse like mine endures: And future Hanburys shall boast, Of verse like mine, of charms like yours. VI A little vain we both may be, Since scarce another house can shew, A poet, that can sing like me; A beauty, that can charm like you. A SONG Upon Miss Harriet Hanbury, address'd to the Rev. Mr. Birt. By the Same. I Dear doctor of St. Mary's, In the hundred of Bergavenny, I've seen such a lass, With a shape and a face, As never was match'd by any. II Such wit, such bloom, and such beauty, Has this girl of Ponty Pool, Sir, With eyes that wou'd make The toughest heart ach, And the wisest man a fool, Sir. III At our fair t'other day she appear'd, Sir, And the Welchmen all flock'd and view'd her; And all of them said, She was fit to have been made A wife for Owen Tudor. IV They wou'd ne'er have been tir'd with gazing, And so much her charms did please, Sir, That all of them staid Till their ale grew dead, And cold was their toasted cheese, Sir. V How happy the lord of the manor, That shall be of her possest, Sir; For all must agree, Who my Harriet shall see, She's a Herriot of the best, Sir. VI Then pray make a ballad about her; We know you have wit if you'd shew it, Then don't be asham'd, You can never be blam'd, For a prophet is often a poet. VII But why don't you make one yourself then? I suppose I by you shall be told, Sir: This beautiful piece, Alas, is my niece; And besides she's but five years old, Sir. VIII But tho', my dear friend, she's no older, In her face it may plainly be seen, Sir, That this angel at five, Will, if she's alive, Be a goddess at fifteen, Sir. To Mr. Garnier and Mr. Pearce of Bath. A grateful ODE, in return for the extraordinary Kindness and Humanity they shewed to me and my eldest Daughter, now Lady Essex, 1753. By the Same. I What glorious verse from Love has sprung? How well has Indignation sung? And can the gentle Muse, Whilst in her once belov'd abode I stray, and suppliant kneel, an ode To Gratitude refuse? II Garnier, my friend, accept this verse, And thou receive, well-natur'd Pearce, All I can give of fame. Let others, other subjects sing, Some murd'rous chief, some tyrant king, Humanity's my theme. III For arts like yours, employ'd by you, Make verse on such a theme your due, To whom indulgent Heav'n Its fav'rite pow'r of doing good, By you so rightly understood, Judiciously has giv'n. IV Behold, obedient to your pow'r, Consuming fevers rage no more, Nor chilling agues freeze; The cripple dances void of pain, The deaf in raptures hear again, The blind transported sees. V Health at your call extends her wing, Each healing plant, each friendly spring, Its various pow'r discloses; O'er Death's approaches you prevail, See Chloe's cheek, of late so pale, Blooms with returning roses. VI These gifts, my friends, which shine in you, Are rare, yet to some chosen few Heav'n has the same assign'd; Health waits on Mead's prescription still, And Hawkins' hand, and Ranby's skill, Are blessings to mankind. VII But hearts like yours are rare indeed, Which for another's wounds can bleed, Another's grief can feel; The lover's fear, the parent's groan, Your natures catch, and make your own, And share the pains you heal. VIII But why to them, Hygeia, why Dost thou thy cordial drop deny Who but for others live? Oh, goddess, hear my pray'r, and grant That these that health may never want, Which they to others give. ODE to DEATH. Translated from the French of the King of Prussia. By Dr. HAWKSWORTH. Yet a few years, or days perhaps, Or moments pass with silent lapse, And time to me shall be no more; No more the sun these eyes shall view, Earth o'er these limbs her dust shall strew, And life's fantastic dream be o'er. Alas! I touch the dreadful brink, From nature's verge impell'd I sink, And endless darkness wraps me round! Yes, Death is ever at my hand, Fast by my bed he takes his stand, And constant at my board is found. Earth, air, and fire, and water, join Against this fleeting life of mine, And where for succour can I fly? If art with flatt'ring wiles pretend To shield me like a guardian friend, By Art, ere Nature bids, I die. I see this tyrant of the mind, This idol Flesh to dust consign'd, Once call'd from dust by pow'r divine; Its features change, 'tis pale, 'tis cold— Hence dreadful spectre! to behold Thy aspect, is to make it mine. And can I then with guilty pride, Which fear nor shame can quell or hide, This flesh still pamper and adorn! Thus viewing what I soon shall be, Can what I am demand the knee, Or look on aught around with scorn? But then this spark that warms, that guides, That lives, that thinks, what fate betides? Can this be dust, a kneaded clod! This yield to death! the soul, the mind, That measures heav'n, and mounts the wind, That knows at once itself and God? Great Cause of all, above, below, Who knows thee must for ever know, Immortal and divine! Thy image on my soul imprest, Of endless being is the test, And bids Eternity be mine! Transporting thought!—but am I sure That endless life will joy secure? Joy's only to the just decreed! The guilty wretch expiring, goes Where vengeance endless life bestows, That endless mis'ry may succeed. Great God, how aweful is the scene! A breath, a transient breath between; And can I jest, and laugh, and play! To earth, alas! too firmly bound, Trees deeply rooted in the ground, Are shiver'd when they're torn away. Vain joys, which envy'd greatness gains, How do ye bind with silken chains, Which ask Herculean strength to break! How with new terrors have ye arm'd The pow'r whose slightest glance alarm'd? How many deaths of one ye make! Yet, dumb with wonder, I behold Man's thoughtless race in error bold, Forget or scorn the laws of death; With these no projects coincide, Nor vows, nor toils, nor hopes, they guide, Each thinks he draws immortal breath. Each blind to fate's approaching hour, Intrigues, or fights, for wealth, or pow'r, And slumb'ring dangers dare provoke: And he who tott'ring scarce sustains A century's age, plans future gains, And feels an unexpected stroke. Go on, unbridled desp'rate band, Scorn rocks, gulphs, winds, search sea and land, And spoil new worlds wherever found. Seize, haste to seize the glitt'ring prize, And sighs, and tears, and pray'rs despise, Nor spare the temple's holy ground. They go, succeed, but look again, The desp'rate hand you seek in vain, Now trod in dust the peasant's scorn. But who that saw their treasures swell, That heard th'insatiate vow rebel, Would e'er have thought them mortal born? See the world's victor mount his car, Blood marks his progress wide and far, Sure he shall reign while ages fly; No, vanish'd like a morning cloud, The hero was but just allow'd To fight, to conquer, and to die. And is it true, I ask with dread, That nations heap'd on nations bled Beneath his chariot's fervid wheel, With trophies to adorn the spot, Where his pale corse was left to rot, And doom'd the hungry reptile's meal? Yes, Fortune weary'd with her play, Her toy, this hero, casts away, And scarce the form of man is seen: Awe chills my breast, my eyes o'erflow, Around my brows no roses glow, The cypress mine, funereal green! Yet in this hour of grief and fears, When aweful Truth unveil'd appears, Some pow'r unknown usurps my breast; Back to the world my thoughts are led, My feet in Folly's lab'rynth tread, And fancy dreams that life is blest. How weak an empress is the mind, Whom Pleasure's flow'ry wreaths can bind, And captive to her altars lead! Weak Reason yields to Phrenzy's rage, And all the world is Folly's stage, And all that act are fools indeed. And yet this strange, this sudden flight, From gloomy cares to gay delight, This sickleness, so light and vain, In life's delusive transient dream, Where men nor things are what they seem, Is all the real good we gain. The Hymns of DIONYSIUS: Translated from the Greek. By the Rev. Mr. MERRICK. [I.] To the Muse. Lend thy voice, celestial maid: Through thy vocal grove convey'd, Let a sudden call from thee Wake my soul to harmony. Raise, oh! raise the hallow'd strain, Mistress of the tuneful train. And thou sacred source of light, Author of our mystic rite, Thou whom erst Latona bore On the sea-girt Delian shore, Join the fav'ring Muse, and shed All thy influence on my head. II. To Apollo. Be still, ye vaulted skies! be still Each hollow vale, each echoing hill, Let earth and seas, and winds attend; Ye birds awhile your notes suspend; Be hush'd each sound; behold him nigh, Parent of sacred harmony; He comes! his unshorn hair behind Loose floating to the wanton wind. Hail, sire of day, whose rosy car, Through the pathless fields of air, By thy winged coursers borne, Opes the eyelids of the morn. Thou, whose locks their light display O'er the wide ætherial way, Wreathing their united rays Into one promiscuous blaze. Under thy all-seeing eye Earth's remotest corners lie; While, in thy repeated course, Issuing from thy fruitful source, Floods of fire incessant stray, Streams of everlasting day. Round thy sphere the starry throng, Varying sweet their ceaseless song, (While their vivid flames on high Deck the clear untroubled sky,) To the tuneful lyre advance, Joining in the mystic dance, And with step alternate beat Old Olympus' lofty seat. At their head the wakeful Moon Drives her milkwhite heifers on, And with measur'd pace and even Glides around the vast of heaven, Journeying with unwearied force, And rejoicing in her course. Time attends with swift career, And forms the circle of the year. III. To Nemesis. Nemesis, whose dreaded weight Turns the scale of human fate; On whose front black terrors dwell, Daughter dire of Justice, hail! Thou whose adamantine rein Curbs the arrogant and vain. Wrong and Force before thee die, Envy shuns thy searching eye, And, her sable wings outspread, Flies to hide her hated head. Where thy wheel with restless round Runs along th'unprinted ground, Humbled there, at thy decree Human greatness bows the knee. Thine it is unseen to trace Step by step each mortal's pace: Thine the sons of Pride to check, And to bend the stubborn neck, Till our lives directed stand By the measure in thy hand. Thou observant sit'st on high With bent brow and stedfast eye, Weighing all that meets thy view In thy balance just and true. Goddess, look propitious down, View us, but without a frown, Nemesis, whose dreaded weight Turns the scale of human fate. Nemesis be still our theme, Power immortal and supreme, Thee we praise, nor thee alone, But add the partner of thy throne. Thee and Justice both we sing, Justice, whose unwearied wing Rears aloft the virtuous name Safe from hell's rapacious claim; And when thou thy wrath hast shed Turns it from the guiltless head. A Satire in the Manner of Persius, in a Dialogue between Atticus and Eugenio. By the late Lord HERVEY. Atticus. Why wears my pensive friend that gloomy brow? Say, whence proceeds th'imaginary woe? What prosp'rous villain hast thou met to-day? Or hath afflicted Virtue cross'd thy way? Is it some crime unpunish'd you deplore, Or right subverted by injurious Power? Be this or that the cause, 'tis wisely done To make the sorrows of mankind your own: To see the injur'd pleading unredress'd, The proud exalted, and the meek oppress'd, Can hurt thy health, and rob thee of thy rest. Your cares are in a hopeful way to cease, If you must find perfection to find peace. But reck thy malice, vent thy stifled rage, Inveigh against the times and lash the age.— Perhaps just recent from the court you come, O'er public ills to ruminate at home: Say, which of all the wretches thou hast seen Hath thrown a morsel to thy hungry spleen? What worthless member of that medley throng, Who basely acts, or tamely suffers wrong? He, who to nothing but his int'rest true, Cajoles the fool he's working to undo: Or that more despicable timorous slave, Who knows himself abus'd, yet hugs the knave? Perhaps you mourn our senate's sinking fame, That shew of freedom dwindled to a name: Where hireling judges deal their venal laws, And the best bidder hath the justest cause; What then? They have the pow'r, and who shall dare to blame The legal wrong that bears Astræa's name? Besides, such thoughts shou'd never stir the rage Of youthful gall;—reflection comes with age: 'Tis our decaying life's autumnal fruit, The bitter produce of our latest shoot, When ev'ry blossom of the tree is dead, Enjoyment wither'd, and our wishes fled: Thine still is in its spring, on ev'ry bough Fair Plenty blooms, and youthful Odours blow; Season of joy, too early to be wise, The time to covet pleasures, not despise: Yours is an age when trifles ought to please, Too soon for reason to attack thy ease. Tho' soon the hour shall come, when thou shalt know 'Tis vain fruition ull, and empty shew. But late examine, late inspect mankind, If seeing pains, 'tis prudence to be blind. Let not their vices yet employ thy thoughts, Laugh at their follies, ere you weep their faults: And when (as sure you must) at length you find What things men are, resolve to arm your mind. Too nicely never their demerits scan, And of their virtues make the most you can. Silent avert the mischief they intend, And cross, but seem not to discern, their end: If they prevail, submit, for prudence lies In suffering well.—'Tis equally unwise, To see the injuries we won't resent, And mourn the evils which we can't prevent. Eugenio. You counsel well to bid me arm my mind. Wou'd the receipt were easy, as 'tis kind; But hard it is for misery to reach That fortitude prosperity can teach. Cou'd I forbid what has been to have been, Or lodge a doubt on truths myself have seen; Cou'd I divest remembrance of her store, And say, collect these images no more; Cou'd I dislodge sensation from my breast, And charm her wakeful faculties to rest; Cou'd I my nature and myself subdue, I might the method you prescribe pursue. But if unfeign'd afflictions we endure, If reason's our disease, and not our cure, Then seeming ease is all we can obtain; As one, who long familiariz'd to pain, Still feels the smart, but ceases to complain. Tho' young in life, yet long inur'd to care, Thus I submissive every evil bear: If unexpected ills alone are hard, Mine shou'd be light, who am for all prepar'd: No disappointments can my peace annoy, Disuse has wean'd me from all hopes of joy: The vain pursuit for ever I give o'er, Repuls'd I strive, betray'd I trust no more: Mankind I know, their nature, and their art, Their vice their own, their virtue but a part; Ill play'd so oft, that all the cheat can tell, And dang'rous only where 'tis acted well. In different classes rang'd, a different name Attends their practice, but the heart's the same. Their hate is interest, interest too their love, On the same springs these different engines move: That sharpens malice, and directs her sting, And thence the honey'd streams of flattery spring. Long I suspected what at last I know: I thought men worthless, now I've prov'd 'em so; Reluctant prov'd it, by too sure a rule, I learn'd my science in a painful school. He buys e'en wisdom at too dear a price, Who pays my sad experience to be wise. Why did I hope, by sanguine views possess'd, That Virtue harbour'd in a human breast? Why did I trust to Flattery's specious wile, The April sunshine of her transient smile? Why disbelieve the lessons of the wise, That taught me young to pierce her thin disguise? I thought their rancour, not their prudence, spoke, That age perverse in false invectives broke; I thought their comments on this gaudy scene The effects of phlegm, and dictated by spleen; That jealous of the joys themselves were past, Their envy try'd to pall their children's taste: Like the deaf adder to the charmer's tongue, I gave no credit to the truths they sung; But, happy in a visionary scheme, Still sought companions worthy my esteem: The tongue, the heart's interpreter I deem'd, And judg'd of what men were by what they seem'd; I thought each warm professor meant me fair, Each supple sycophant a friend sincere. The solemn hypocrite, whose close design Mirth never interrupts, nor love, nor wine, Who talks on any secret but his own, Collecting all, communicating none; Who still attentive to what others say, Observes to wound, or questions to betray; Of him as guardian of my private thought, In morning counsels cool resolves I sought; To him still open, cautiously consign'd The inmost treasures of my secret mind; My joys, and griefs delighted to impart, In sacred confidence unmix'd with art; That dangerous pleasure of the honest heart! Whene'er I purpos'd to unbend my soul In social banquets, where the circling bowl To gladness lifts all sorrows but despair, And gives a transient Lethe to our care; I chose the men whose talents entertain And season converse with a lively strain; Who thoughtless still, by hope, nor fear perplex'd, Enjoy the present hour, and risque the next. These not the luxury of slothful ease, Soft downy beds, nor balmy slumbers please; While wakeful kings on purple couches own The secret sorrows of their envy'd crown, And wait revolving light, with shorter rest Than e'en those wretches by their power opprest: This jocund train, devoted to delight, In chearful vigils still protract the night, Nor dread the cares approaching with the day; Thro' each vicissitude for ever gay. With such I commun'd, pleas'd that I cou'd find Recess so grateful to the active mind: And while the youths in sprightly contest try, With humorous tale, or apposite reply, Or amorous song, or inoffensive jest, (The test of wit) to glad the lengthen'd feast; My soul, said I, depend upon their truth, For fraud inhabits not the breast of youth; Indulge thy genius here, be free, be safe, Mirth is their aim, they covet but to laugh; Pure from deceit, as ignorant of care, Their friendship, and their joys are both sincere. I judg'd their nature, like their humour good; As if the soul depended on the blood; And that the seeds of honesty must grow Wherever health resides, or spirits flow. I see my error: but I see too late: 'Tis vain inspection to look back on Fate.— What are the men who most esteem'd we find, But such whose vices are the most refin'd? Blind preference! for vice like poison shews, The surest death is in the subtlest dose.— To such reflections when I turn my mind, I loath my being, and abhor mankind. What joy for truth, what commerce for the just, If all our safety's founded on distrust; If all our wisdom is a mean deceit, And he who prospers but the ablest cheat! Atticus. O early wise! how well hast thou defin'd The worth, the joys, the friendship of mankind! Eugenio. Blest be the pow'rs, I know their abject state. Atticus. Yet bear with this, and hope a better fate. Thrice happy they, who view with stable eyes The shifting scene, who temp'rate, firm, and wise, Can bear its sorrows, and its joys despise; Who look on disappointments, shocks, and strife, And all the consequential ills of life, Not as severities the gods impose, But easy terms indulgent Heav'n allows To man, by short probation to obtain Immortal recompence for transient pain. Th'intent of Heav'n thus rightly understood, From every evil we extract a good: This truth divine implanted in the heart, Supports each drudging mortal thro' his part; Gives a delightful prospect to the blind; The friendless thence a constant succour find: The wretch by fraud betray'd, by pow'r oppress'd, With this restorative still soothes his breast; This suffering Virtue chears, this Pain beguiles, And decks Calamity herself in smiles. When Mead and Freind have ransack'd ev'ry rule, Taught in Hippocrates' and Galen's school, To quiet ills that mock the leech's art, Which opiates fail to deaden in the heart, This cordial still th'incurable sustains: He triumphs in the sharp instructive pains, Nor like a Roman hero, falsely great, With impious hand anticipates his fate; But waits resign'd the slow approach of death; Till that great Power who gave, demands his breath. Such are thy solid comforts, love divine, Such solid comforts, O my friend, be thine. On this firm basis thy foundation lay, Of happiness unsubject to decay. On man no more, that frail support, depend, The kindest patron, or the warmest friend; The warmest friend may one day prove untrue, And interest change the kindest patron's view. Hear not, my friend, the fondness they profess, Nor on the trial grieve to find it less: With patience each capricious change endure; Careful to merit where reward is sure. To Providence implicitly resign'd, Let this grand precept poise thy wavering mind: With partial eyes we view our own weak cause, And rashly scan her upright equal laws: For undeserv'd she ne'er inflicts a woe, Nor is her recompence unsure, tho' slow. Unpunish'd none transgress, deceiv'd none trust, Her rules are fixt, and all her ways are just. To Mrs. BINDON at Bath. By the Honourable Sir C. H. Williams. Apollo of old on Britannia did smile, And Delphi forsook for the sake of this isle, Around him he lavishly scatter'd his lays, And in every wilderness planted his bays; Then Chaucer and Spenser harmonious were heard, Then Shakespear, and Milton, and Waller appear'd, And Dryden, whose brows by Apollo were crown'd, As he sung in such strains as the God might have own'd: But now, since the laurel is given of late To Cibber, to Eusden, to Shadwell and Tate, Apollo hath quitted the isle he once lov'd, And his harp and his bays to Hibernia remov'd; He vows and he swears he'll inspire us no more, And has put out Pope's fires which he kindled before; And further he says, men no longer shall boast A science their slight and ill treatment hath lost; But that women alone for the future shall write; And who can resist, when they doubly delight? And lest we shou'd doubt what he said to be true, Has begun by inspiring Saphira and You. Mrs. BINDON's Answer. When home I return'd from the dancing last night, And elate by your praises attempted to write, I familiarly call'd on Apollo for aid, And told him how many fine things you had said; He smil'd at my folly, and gave me to know, Your wit, and not mine, by your writing you shew; And then, says the God, still to make you more vain, He hath promis'd that I shall enlighten your brain, When he knows in his heart, if he speak but his mind, That no woman alive can now boast I am kind: For since Daphne to shun me grew into a laurel, With the sex I have sworn still to keep up the quarrel. I thought it all joke, 'till by writing to you, I have prov'd his resentment, alas! but too true. Sir CHARLES's Reply. I'll not believe that Phœbus did not smile, Unhappily for you I know his stile; To strains like yours of old his harp he strung, And while he dictated Orinda sung. Did beauteous Daphne's scorn of proffer'd love Against the sex his indignation move? It rather made you his peculiar care, Convinc'd from thence, ye were as good as fair. As mortals who from dust receiv'd their birth, Must when they die return to native earth; So too the laurel, that your brow adorns, Sprang from the fair, and to the fair returns. To a LADY, who sent Compliments to a Clergyman upon the Ten of Hearts. Your compliments, dear lady, pray forbear, Old English services are more sincere; You send Ten Hearts, the tythe is only mine, Give me but One, and burn the other Nine. The GROTTO. Written by the late Mr. Green of the Custom-House, under the Name of Peter Drake, a Fisherman of Brentford. Printed in the Year 1732, but never published. Scilicet hic possis curvo dignoscere rectum, Atque inter silvas Academi quærere verum. Hor. Our wits Apollo's influence beg, The Grotto makes them all with egg: Finding this chalk-stone in my nest, I strain, and lay among the rest. Adieu awhile, forsaken flood, To ramble in the Delian wood, And pray the God my well-meant song May not my subject's merit wrong. Say, father Thames, whose gentle pace Gives leave to view what beauties grace Your flow'ry banks, if you have seen The much sung Grotto of the queen. Contemplative, forget awhile Oxonian towers, and Windsor's pile, And Woolsey's pride (his greatest guilt) And what great William since has built; And flowing fast by Richmond scenes, (Honour'd retreat of two great queens) From Sion-house, whose proud survey Brow-beats your flood, look cross the way, And view, from highest swell of tide, The milder scenes of Surry side. Though yet no palace grace the shore, To lodge that pair you shou'd adore; Nor abbies, great in ruin, rise, Royal equivalents for vice; Behold a Grott, in Delphic grove, The Graces' and the Muses' love. (O might our laureat study here, How would he hail his new-born year!) A temple from vain glories free, Whose goddess is Philosophy, Whose sides such licens'd idols crown As superstition wou'd pull down; The only pilgrimage I know That men of sense wou'd chuse to go: Which sweet abode, her wisest choice, Urania chears with heavenly voice, While all the Virtues gather round, To see her consecrate the ground. If thou the God with winged feet, In council talk of this retreat, And jealous gods resentment show At altars rais'd to men below; Tell those proud lords of heaven, 'tis fit Their house our heroes should admit; While each exists, as poets sing, A lazy lewd immortal thing, They must (or grow in disrepute) With earth's first commoners recruit. Needless it is in terms unskill'd To praise whatever Boyle shall build; Needless it is the busts to name Of men, monopolists of fame; Four chiefs adorn the modest stone, For virtue as for learning known; The thinking sculpture helps to raise Deep thoughts, the genii of the place: To the mind's ear, and inward sight, Their silence speaks, and shade gives light: While insects from the threshold preach, And minds dispos'd to musing teach: Proud of strong limbs and painted hues, They perish by the slightest bruise; Or maladies begun within, Destroy more slow life's frail machine; From maggot-youth thro' change of state They feel like us the turns of Fate; Some born to creep have liv'd to fly, And change earth-cells for dwellings high; And some that did their six wings keep, Before they dy'd been forc'd to creep. They politics like ours profess, The greater prey upon the less: Some strain on foot huge loads to bring; Some toil incessant on the wing; And in their different ways explore Wise sense of want by future store; Nor from their vigorous schemes desist Till death, and then are never mist. Some frolick, toil, marry, increase, Are sick and well, have war and peace, And broke with age, in half a day Yield to successors, and away. Let not profane this sacred place, Hypocrisy with Janus' face; Or pomp, mixt state of pride and care; Court kindness, Falshood's polish'd ware; Scandal disguis'd in Friendship's veil, That tells, unask'd, th'injurious tale; Or art politic, which allows The jesuit-remedy for vows; Or priest, perfuming crowned head, Till in a swoon Truth lies for dead; Or tawdry critic, who perceives No grace, which plain proportion gives, And more than lineaments divine Admires the gilding of the shrine; Or that self-haunting spectre Spleen, In thickest fog the clearest seen; Or Prophecy, which dreams a lie, That fools believe and knaves apply; Or frolick Mirth profanely loud, And happy only in a crowd; Or Melancholy's pensive gloom, Proxy in Contemplation's room. O Delia, when I touch this string, To thee my Muse directs her wing. Unspotted fair, with downcast look Mind not so much the murm'ring brook; Nor fixt in thought, with footsteps slow Through cypress allies cherish woe: I see the soul in pensive fit, And mopeing like sick linnet sit, With dewy eye and moulting wing, Unperch'd, averse to fly or sing; I see the favourite curls begin (Disus'd to toilet discipline,) To quit their post, lose their smart air, And grow again like common hair; And tears, which frequent kerchiefs dry, Raise a red circle round the eye; And by this bur about the moon, Conjecture more ill weather soon. Love not so much the doleful knell; And news the boding night-birds tell; Nor watch the wainscot's hollow blow; And hens portentous when they crow; Nor sleepless mind the death-watch beat; In taper find no winding sheet; Nor in burnt coal a coffin see, Tho' thrown at others meant for thee: Or when the coruscation gleams, Find out not first the bloody streams; Nor in imprest remembrance keep Grim tap'stry figures wrought in sleep; Nor rise to see in antique hall The moon-light monsters on the wall, And shadowy spectres darkly pass Trailing their sables o'er the grass. Let vice and guilt act how they please In souls, their conquer'd provinces; By heaven's just charter it appears, Virtue's exempt from quartering fears. Shall then arm'd fancies fiercely drest, Live at discretion in your breast? Be wise, and pannic fright disdain, As notions, meteors of the brain; And sighs perform'd, illusive scene! By magic lanthorn of the spleen. Come here, from baleful cares releas'd, With Virtue's ticket, to a feast, Where decent mirth and wisdom join'd In stewardship, regale the mind. Call back the Cupids to your eyes, I see the godlings with surprize Not knowing home in such a plight, Fly to and fro, afraid to light.— Far from my theme, from method far, Convey'd in Venus' flying car, I go compell'd by feather'd steeds, That scorn the rein when Delia leads. No dawb of elegiac strain These holy walls shall ever stain; As spiders Irish wainscot flee, Falshood with them shall disagree: This floor let not the vulgar tread, Who worship only what they dread; Nor bigots who but one way see Through blinkers of authority; Nor they who its four saints defame By making virtue but a name; Nor abstract wit, (painful regale To hunt the pig with slippery tail!) Artists who richly chase their thought, Gaudy without but hollow wrought, And beat too thin, and tool'd too much To bear the proof and standard touch; Nor fops to guard this silvan ark With necklace bells in treble bark; Nor Cynics growl and fiercely paw, The mastiffs of the moral law. Come Nymph with rural honours drest, Virtue's exterior form confest, With charms untarnish'd, innocence Display, and Eden shall commence: When thus you come in sober fit, And wisdom is prefer'd to wit; And looks diviner graces tell, Which don't with giggling muscles dwell; And beauty like the ray-clipt sun, With bolder eye we look upon; Learning shall with obsequious mien Tell all the wonders she has seen; Reason her logic armour quit, And proof to mild persuasion fit; Religion with free thought dispense, And cease crusading against sense; Philosophy and she embrace, And their first league again take place; And morals pure, in duty bound, Nymph-like the sister chiefs surround; Nature shall smile, and round this cell The turf to your light pressure swell, And knowing beauty by her shoe, Well air its carpet from the dew. The Oak, while you his umbrage deck Lets fall his acorns in your neck: Zephyr his civil kisses gives, And plays with curls, instead of leaves: Birds, seeing you, believe it spring, And during their vacation sing; And flow'rs lean forward from their seats To traffic in exchange of sweets; And angels bearing wreaths descend, Preferr'd as vergers to attend This fane, whose deity intreats The Fair to grace its upper seats. O kindly view our letter'd strife, And guard us through polemic life; From poison vehicled in praise, For satire's shots but slightly graze; We claim your zeal, and find within, Philosophy and you are kin. What Virtue is we judge by you, For actions right are beauteous too: By tracing the sole female mind, We best what is true Nature find: Your vapours bred from fumes declare, How streams create tempestuous air, Till gushing tears and hasty rain Make heaven and you serene again: Our travels through the starry skies Were first suggested by your eyes; We by the interposing fan, Learn how eclipses first began; The vast ellipse from Scarbro's home, Describes how blazing comets roam; The glowing colours of the cheek Their origin from Phœbus speak; Our watch how Luna strays above Feels like the care of jealous love; And all things we in science know From your known love for riddles flow. Father! forgive, thus far I stray, Drawn by attraction from my way. Mark next with awe, the foundress well Who on these banks delights to dwell; You on the terrass see her plain, Move like Diana with her train. If you then fairly speak your mind, In wedlock since with Isis join'd, You'll own, you never yet did see, At least in such a high degree, Greatness delighted to undress; Science a scepter'd hand caress; A queen the friends of freedom prize; A woman wise men canonize. The Bee, the Ant, and the Sparrow: A FABLE. Address'd to Phebe and Kitty C. at Boarding School. My dears, 'tis said in days of old, That beasts cou'd talk, and birds could scold. But now it seems the human race Alone engross the speaker's place. Yet lately, if report be true, (And much the tale relates to you) There met a Sparrow, Ant, and Bee, Which reason'd and convers'd as we. Who reads my page will doubtless grant That Phe's the wise industrious Ant. And all with half an eye may see That Kitty is the busy Bee. Here then are two—but where's the third? Go search your school, you'll find the Bird. Your school! I ask your pardon fair, I'm sure you'll find no Sparrow there. Now to my tale—One summer's morn A Bee rang'd o'er the verdant lawn; Studious to husband every hour, And make the most of every flow'r. Nimble from stalk to stalk she flies, And loads with yellow wax her thighs; With which the artist builds her comb, And keeps all tight and warm at home: Or from the cowslip's golden bells Sucks honey to enrich her cells: Or every tempting rose pursues, Or sips the lilly's fragrant dews; Yet never robs the shining bloom, Or of its beauty or perfume. Thus she discharg'd in every way The various duties of the day. It chanc'd a frugal Ant was near, Whose brow was wrinkled o'er by care: A great œconomist was she, Nor less laborious than the Bee; By pensive parents often taught What ills arise from want of thought; That poverty on sloth depends, On poverty the loss of friends. Hence every day the Ant is found With anxious steps to tread the ground; With curious search to trace the grain, And drag the heavy load with pain. The active Bee with pleasure saw The Ant fulfil her parents' law. Ah! sister-labourer, says she, How very fortunate are we! Who taught in infancy to know The comforts, which from labour flow, Are independent of the great, Nor know the wants of pride and state. Why is our food so very sweet? Because we earn, before we eat. Why are our wants so very few? Because we nature's calls pursue. Whence our complacency of mind? Because we act our parts assign'd. Have we incessant tasks to do? Is not all nature busy too! Doth not the sun with constant pace Persist to run his annual race? Do not the stars, which shine so bright, Renew their courses every night? Doth not the ox obedient bow His patient neck, and draw the plough? Or when did e'er the generous steed Withhold his labour or his speed? If you all nature's system scan, The only idle thing is man! A wanton Sparrow long'd to hear Their sage discourse, and strait drew near. The bird was talkative and loud, And very pert and very proud; As worthless and as vain a thing, Perhaps as ever wore a wing. She found, as on a spray she sat, The little friends were deep in chat; That virtue was their favourite theme, And toil and probity their scheme: Such talk was hateful to her breast, She thought them arrant prudes at best. When to display her naughty mind, Hunger with cruelty combin'd; She view'd the Ant with savage eyes, And hopt and hopt to snatch her prize. The Bee, who watch'd her opening bill, And guess'd her fell design to kill; Ask'd her from what her anger rose, And why she treated Ants as foes? The Sparrow her reply began, And thus the conversation ran. Whenever I'm dispos'd to dine, I think the whole creation mine; That I'm a bird of high degree, And every insect made for me. Hence oft I search the emmet brood, For emmets are delicious food: And oft in wantonness and play, I slay ten thousand in a day. For truth it is, without disguise, That I love mischief as my eyes. Oh! fie, the honest Bee reply'd, I fear you make base man your guide; Of every creature sure the worst, Tho' in creation's scale the first! Ungrateful man! 'tis strange he thrives, Who burns the Bees, to rob their hives! I hate his vile administration, And so do all the emmet nation. What fatal foes to birds are men Quite to the Eagle from the Wren! Oh! do not men's example take, Who mischief do for mischief's sake; But spare the Ant—her worth demands Esteem and friendship at your hands. A mind with every virtue blest, Must raise compassion in your breast. Virtue! rejoin'd the sneering bird, Where did you learn that gothic word? Since I was hatch'd, I never heard, That virtue was at all rever'd. But say it was the ancients' claim, Yet moderns disavow the name; Unless, my dear, you read romances, I cannot reconcile your fancies. Virtue in fairy tales is seen To play the goddess or the queen; But what's a queen without the pow'r, Or beauty, child, without a dow'r? Yet this is all that virtue brags, At best 'tis only worth in rags. Such whims my very heart derides, Indeed you make me burst my sides. Trust me Miss Bee—to speak the truth, I've copyed men from earliest youth; The same our taste, the same our school, Passion and appetite our rule. And call me bird, or call me sinner, I'll ne'er forego my sport or dinner. A prowling cat the miscreant spies, And wide expands her amber eyes: Near and more near Grimalkin draws, She wags her tail, protends her paws; Then springing on her thoughtless prey, She bore the vicious bird away. Thus in her cruelty and pride, The wicked wanton Sparrow dy'd. ODE on a STORM. With gallant pomp, and beauteous pride The floating pile in harbour rode, Proud of her freight, the swelling tide Reluctant left the vessel's side, And rais'd it as she flow'd. The waves with Eastern breezes curl'd, Had silver'd half the liquid plain; The anchors weigh'd, the sails unfurl'd, Serenely mov'd the wooden world, And stretch'd along the main. The scaly natives of the deep Press to admire the vast machine, In sporting gambols round it leap, Or swimming low, due distance keep, In homage to their queen. Thus, as life glides in gentle gale Pretended friendship waits on pow'r, But early quits the borrow'd veil When adverse Fortune shifts the sail, And hastens to devour. In vain we fly approaching ill, Danger can multiply its form; Expos'd we fly like Jonas still, And heaven, when 'tis heaven's will, O'ertakes us in a storm. The distant surges foamy white Foretel the furious blast; Dreadful, tho' distant was the sight, Confed'rate winds and waves unite, And menace ev'ry mast. Winds whistling thro' the shrouds, proclaim A fatal harvest on the deck, Quick in pursuit as active flame, Too soon the rolling ruin came, And ratify'd the wreck. Thus, Adam smil'd with new-born grace, Life's flame inspir'd by heav'nly breath; Thus the same breath sweeps off his race, Disorders Nature's beauteous face, And spreads disease and death. Stripp'd of her pride the vessel rolls, And as by sympathy she knew The secret anguish of our souls, With inward deeper groans condoles The danger of her crew. Now what avails it to be brave, On liquid precipices hung? Suspended on a breaking wave, Beneath us yawn'd a sea-green grave, And silenc'd ev'ry tongue. The faithless flood forsook her keel, And downward launch'd the lab'ring hull, Stunn'd she forgot awhile to reel, And felt almost, or seem'd to seel A momentary lull. Thus in the jaws of death we lay, Nor light, nor comfort found us there, Lost in the gulph and floods of spray No sun to chear us, nor a ray Of hope, but all despair. The nearer shore, the more despair, While certain ruin waits on land; Should we pursue our wishes there, Soon we recant the fatal pray'r, And strive to shun the strand. At length, the Being whose behest Reduc'd this Chaos into form, His goodness and his pow'r express'd, He spoke—and, as a God, suppress'd Our troubles, and the storm. ISAIAH XXXIV. Come near, ye nations! and give ear, O earth! Ye distant isles, and continents remote, Where-e'er dispers'd beneath the vast expanse Of heav'n's high roof, attend! Attend, and hear Your doom tremendous ratify'd above, Sad retribution of enormous guilt, Which calling loud for justice and revenge, Flew swift as light up to the throne of God, And pull'd down dire destruction on the earth. The mighty God, with all his thunder arm'd, Will cast abroad the terrors of his wrath; And show'r down vengeance on the guilty land. The Lord of hosts amidst a night of clouds, And with the majesty of darkness crown'd, Thunder'd aloft; and from the inmost heav'n Hurl'd down impetuous fury swift as thought Through th'azure void, wide-stretch'd from pole to pole, To ravage all the boundless universe. As when a blust'ring wind rolls from the north, And shakes all autumn with the driving blast; So shall the fury of th'Omnipotent Destroy the nations, and confound their arms, Swords, shields, and spears, and all the pow'rs of war; With eager speed rush o'er th'embattled ranks, And thro' the thick battalions urge its way. Jehovah's arm will shake the vast convex, And wrap the whole circumference around In wasting desolation, ruin wide. Destructive slaughter, ghastly to behold, Dire specimen of wrath omnipotent, Shall march tremendous o'er the burden'd earth, Oppress'd, and conscious of unusual weight, Shrinking beneath the heavy load of death. The purple piles, and mountains of the slain, Expiring wretches, pouring out their souls With bursts of groans, shall fill the lab'ring world. Each slaughter'd corps shall breath a pestilence; And wide around diffuse the scents of death. Th'eternal hills shall float in seas of blood; And mountains vanish in the crimson tide. Nature's huge volume shall be folded up Like a vast scroll; and all the glittering orbs Drop from the heavens like autumnal leaves, Or the ripe fig, when sultry Sirius reigns; While peals of thunder rattling in the skies, Shall roll incessant o'er th'astonish'd world. Death and destruction threat'ning all below, And in substantial darkness high enthron'd, Shall draw the curtains of eternal night, And spread confusion hideous o'er the earth, As when the embryo world ere time began, In one rude heap, one undigested mass Of jarring discord, and disorder lay. The sun, amaz'd to see the wild obscure, No more with radiant light shall gild the skies; No more diffusing his all genial beams On the high mountains spread the shining morn; But downwards flaming thro' the vast immense, Shall hide his glory in eternal night. Thus in loud thunder speaks th'Almighty Sire— In copious slaughter will I take my sword, And, Idumea! thou shalt swim in blood. The Lord shall hasten from the lofty skies; Destruction on his aweful footsteps waits; Death stalks before, ruin on every side Proclaims the terror of an angry God. The ravenous sword, pamper'd with reeking gore, Drunk with the blood of half the rebel world, Shall there be sheath'd in Israel's stubborn foes. Bozrah with human sacrifice shall smoke, And Idumea, thoughtless of her fate, Shall feel the smart of heav'n's avenging rod. The great, the small, th'oppressor, and th'oppress'd, Shall join promiscuous in the common heap; And one vast ruin shall involve them all. For Israel's God is girt with burning rage, And vows a last revenge to Zion's foes. The silver streams, that shine alone the plain, And chide their banks, and tinkle as they run, Shall stop, and stagnate to a sable pool; And, black with mud, unconscious of a tide, No more shall charm the sense, or lull the soul, Or in soft murmurs die upon the ear: But in crude streams and deadly stench exhale, And with contagious vapours load the sky. Rapacious flames, in pyramids of fire, Shall burn unquenchable; and sulph'rous smoke, Advancing o'er the horizontal plain, In dusky wreaths roll ever to the skies. Th'inhospitable land, left desolate, Unfruitful, but in ev'ry noxious weed, Shall be a lonely desart, waste and wild; Within whose silent confines none shall dwell; Nor ever more be heard th'harmonious voice Of warbling birds, that heretofore were wont In vocal choir to animate the grove, And from the shady covert of the trees Dispense sweet music to the list'ning vale: But hooting owls, that spread their lazy wings O'er the dark gloom, and with their boding screams Double the native horrors of the night; These with the cormorants shall dwell therein, Securely in the upper lintels lodge, And in the windows direful dirges sing. God shall extend, and bare his thund'ring arm; And with confusion circumscribe the land. Where are the nobles, and the mighty chiefs, That in soft ease their silken moments waste; To whom their prostrate vassals throng in crowds, Striving who first shall aweful homage pay, And adoration! Them shall they invoke; But all in vain; their names shall be no more, But in their stead more worthy savages, With rapine uncontrouble shall reign; And nobler brutes shall canton out the land. Those regal domes, and tow'ring palaces, That high in clouds exalt their impious heads, Reflecting thro' the liquid firmament Home to the distant ken a dazling blaze, Thorns shall surround, and nettles grow within: Ivy shall creep along the painted walls: The matted grass o'erspread the polish'd floor; And brambles vile entwine the empty throne. While beasts from different climes, joyous to find A place of rest to man alone denied, Shall take possession of the gilded domes: The shaggy satyrs, that old forests haunt, The ostrich and his mate, and dragons huge Shall sport, and revel in the dreary waste. There the hoarse screech-owls, that in dead of night Upon the chimney tops perch ominous, While songs obscene the silent hours disturb, Shall in loud shrieks their sad presages tell, Shall unmolested solitude enjoy, And desolation make more desolate. Ravens, and vulturs, scenting from afar The universal slaughter, shall come forth From the high mountain, and the humble vale, Croaking in hideous concert, as they fly, Dark'ning the heavens with their ghastly train; And glut their hungry jaws with human prey, Not one of these shall fail; none want her mate; But shall for ever, such the Lord's decree, In Edom's ruins wanton undisturb'd. This is the fate, ordain'd for Zion's foes. ISAIAH XXXV. When Idumea, and the nations round, Th'inveterate foes of Israel, and of God, Lie vanquish'd, dormant on the dreary waste Of far extended ruin; and involv'd In hideous woe, and desolation wide, Then shall Judea lift her cheerful head; Put forth the leaves of glad prosperity; And, after all the gloomy scene of grief And sad affliction, flourish and revive In all the bright serenity of peace. As the gay rose, when winter storms are past, Warm'd with the influence of a kinder sun, Comes from the bud with a vermilion blush, Cheering the sight, and scattering all around A balmy odour, that perfumes the skies. She shall rejoice with joy unspeakable, And, fraught with richest blessings from above, Spring forth in all the pride of Lebanon, Whose lofty cedars, wond'rous to behold, In bodies huge, and to the skies erect Stand eminent, branch over branch out-spread In reg'lar distances, and verdant shades, Emblem of happy state. Nor shall the hills Of fragrant Carmel, rich in fruitful soil; Nor Sharon's flow'ry plain in all its bloom, Array'd in Nature's goodliest attire, And breathing fresh a gale of heav'nly sweets, Spring forth in greater glory. For the Lord His goodness will declare, that knows no bounds; And all the people shall behold his might, And see the wonders of omnipotence. Strengthen the languid nerves, ye seers! and bid The trembling hand be strong. Call into life The dissipated spirits; and confirm The feeble knees; th'unactive joints support; And bid the lazy blood flow briskly on, And circulate with joy thro' every vein. Comfort th'oppress'd; and smooth the ruffled mind; Say to th'afflicted heart, devoid of hope, Behold! th'Almighty rushes from the skies, Ev'n Israel's God from his refulgent throne Of glory comes, but not with radiant blaze Of light, ev'n light invisible, as when To Moses on Mount Horeb he appear'd, And sent his faithful servant to redeem Ungrateful Israel from Egyptian bonds; Nor with the music of a still, soft voice, As when h' inform'd the prophet of his will; But in a black and dreadful hemisphere Of darkness, arm'd with flaming thunderbolts, And flashes of red lightning to increase The woe, and make ev'n darkness visible. The hills shall tremble at his dire approach; And fearful mountains, pil'd up to the clouds, Fall down precipitant with rapid force, And spread a plain immense. For God will come Full fraught with vengeance to consume your foes; You in his bounteous mercy to protect. Then shall the eyes long clos'd in blackest night, To whom no gladsome dawn of light appear'd, But comfortless, impenetrable shade, Shake off the film of darkness, and behold The long-expected day. New scenes of joy Shall then appear, and various prospects rise To cheer the new-born sight. The deafen'd ear, On whose dull nerves sad-moping Silence dwelt, And lock'd from music's note, or voice of man, Shall open glad its labyrinths of sound, Again the stringed instrument shall feel, And the sweet words of social converse hear. The lame, infirm, creeping with slow advance, Dragging with pain reluctant feet along, And scarcely by the friendly crutch sustain'd, Shall throw th'unserviceable prop aside, And stand erect, exulting like a roe Upon Mount Tabor, frisking nimbly round On the soft verdant turf, with wanton tread Skimming along the surface of the plain, Or lightly bounding o'er the rising ground. The dumb for melancholy silence fram'd, Cut off from friendly converse with mankind, Striving in vain the sad defect to mend With gabb'ring noise of broken syllables Confus'd, shall talk in dialects compleat; And tongues, that knew not how to speak, shall sing. New scenes of joy shall gladden ev'ry face; And universal peace o'erspread the land. The glowing ground, gaping with burning thirst, Shall greedily suck in the humid tide, Pouring from caverns of the craggy hills In limpid streams, still warbling, as they fall, Melodious murmurs down the ample glade, And crystal springs refresh the thirsty land. Where heretofore the curling serpent lay In many a wily labyrinth self-roll'd, Or swept deceitful o'er the dusty plain In horrid spires, and many a tow'ring maze, The trembling reed shall wave his fringed top; And the tall rush in slender spires up-rise. The swampy marsh shall its broad flag produce, With bending willow, sport of every wind; And vegetable earth new bloom display Delightful, with prolific verdure cloth'd, A wasteful desart now, and barren soil. A way shall be prepar'd, a path direct, Mark'd out by line with an unerring hand, Ev'n a streight path, which God himself shall make; It shall be call'd, The way of holiness; A way to sacred footsteps only known, Where the unhallow'd shall no entrance find, Nor impious feet profane the sacred ground. God shall attend the motions of the just, Watch o'er their steps, and guide them as they go; And none shall wander from the obvious path, For who can err, when God directs the way? The rampant lion shall not wander there, Nor fiery tiger, roaring for his prey; Nor prowling wolf, that howls along the plain, With the keen pangs of raging hunger stung; Nor surly bear in Nebo's mountains bred, Or Carmel's forest ranging merciless; Such as came furious from the neighb'ring groves Of ancient Bethel with voracious speed, Grinning destruction as they roam'd along, And slew the mockers of the good old seer. But free, and unmolested shall they walk Whom heav'n protects, and God vouchsafes to guide. The ransom'd captives, weary of the yoke, The heavy yoke of long oppressive thrall, Shall cheerfully return to happier climes, In melody break forth the gladden'd heart, That speaks deliverance, and the voice of joy. Judah shall witness to the grateful song; And faithful Zion echo back the sound. No signs of woe shall hang upon the cheek, No shuddering fear, nor horrible despair; But grief with all its melancholy train Of huge dismay shall fly from ev'ry face. Gladness shall crown the head, peace fill the heart, And endless rapture dwell on ev'ry brow. WOODSTOCK PARK. A Poem. By WILLIAM HARRISON. 1706. Habitarunt Dî quoque silvas. Virg. Kind heav'n at length, successfully implor'd, To Britain's arms her hero had restor'd: And now our fears remov'd, with loud applause Jointly we crown'd his conduct, and his cause. Transporting pleasure rais'd each drooping tongue, The peasants shouted, and the poets sung. The poets sung, tho' Addison alone Adorns thy laurels, and maintains his own; In him alone, great Marlborough, is seen, Thy graceful motion, and thy godlike mien: Each action he exalts with rage divine, And the full Danube flows in ev'ry line. But we in vain to that sublime aspire; So heatless glow-worms emulate the fire, Shine without warmth: another song prepare, My Muse; the country is the Muse's care; Thither thy much-lov'd Marlborough pursue With eager verse, and keep thy theme in view. But oh! what joyful numbers can disclose The various raptures his approach bestows; How vales resound, how crowds collected share The radiant glories of the matchless pair? The gen'rous youths, within whose bosoms glow Some secret unripe longings for a foe, Surveying here the favourite of Fame, Conceive new hopes, and nurse the growing flame: While softer maids confess a pleasing pain, And sighing wish he had been born a swain. So when the pow'rs appeas'd bade discord cease, And Greece obtain'd from jarring gods a peace, The god of war, and beauteous queen of love, To Cyprian shades their peaceful chariot drove: Shepherds and nymphs attending form'd the train, And mirth unusual revell'd on the plain. And should the gods once more their heav'n forego, To range on earth, and bless mankind below, O'er all the globe no region would be found, With nobler soil, or brighter beauty crown'd. Phœbus for this would change his Delphic grove, Juno her Samos, and his Ida Jove. Olympic games no longer should delight, But neighb'ring plains afford a nobler sight. Where England's great Æneas standing by, Impatient youths on winged coursers fly: Urg'd by his presence they outstrip the wind Involv'd in smoke, and leave the Muse behind. But see! once more returns the rival train, And now they stretch, now bending loose the rein, And fears and hopes beat high in ev'ry vein, 'Till one (long since successful in the field) Exerts that strength he first with art conceal'd; Then swift as light'ning darted through the skies, Springs forward to the goal, and bears away the prize. By arts like these all other palms are won, They end with glory, who with caution run. We neither write, nor act, what long can last, When the first heat sees all our vigour past; But, jaded, both their short-liv'd mettle lose, The furious statesman, and the fiery Muse. The contest ended, night with gloomy face O'erspreads the heav'n; and now with equal pace The victor, and the vanquish'd, quit the place: Sleep's friendly office is to all the same, His conquest he forgets, and they their shame. Next morning, ere the sun with sickly ray O'er doubtful shades maintains the dawning day, The sprightly horn proclaims some danger near, And hounds, harmonious to the sportsman's ear, With deep-mouth'd notes rouse up the trembling deer. Startled he leaps aside, and list'ning round, This way and that explores the hostile sound, Arm'd for that fight, which he declines with shame, Too fond of life, too negligent of fame; For Nature, to display her various art, Had fortify'd his head, but not his heart: Those spears, which useless on his front appear'd, On any else had been ador'd and fear'd. But honours disproportion'd are a load, Grandeur a specious curse, when ill bestow'd. Thus void of hope, and panting with surprize, In vain he'd combat, and as vainly flies. Of paths mysterious whether to pursue The scented track informs the lab'ring crew: With speed redoubled, they the hint embrace, Whilst animating music warms the chace: Flush'd are their hopes, and with one gen'ral cry They echo thro' the woods, and sound their conquest nigh. Not so the prey; he now for safety bends From enemies profess'd, to faithless friends, Who to the wretched own no shelter due, But fly more swiftly than his foes pursue. This last disgrace with indignation fires His drooping soul, and gen'rous rage inspires; By all forsaken, he resolves at length To try the poor remains of wasted strength; With looks and mien majestic stands at bay, And whets his horns for the approaching fray: Too late alas! for, the first charge begun, Soon he repents what cowardice had done, Owns the mistake of his o'er-hasty flight, And aukwardly maintains a languid fight; Here, and there, aiming a successless blow, And only seems to nod upon the foe. So coward princes, who at war's alarm Start from their greatness, and themselves disarm, With recollected forces strive in vain Their empire, or their honour, to regain, And turn to rally on some distant plain, Whilst the fierce conqu'ror bravely urges on, Improves th'advantage, and ascends the throne. Forgive, great Denham, that in abject verse, What richly thou adorn'st, I thus rehearse. Thy noble chace all others does exceed, In artful fury, and well-temper'd speed. We read with pleasure, imitate with pain, Where faney fires, and judgment holds the rein. Goddess, proceed; and as to relicks sound Altars we raise, and consecrate the ground, Pay thou thy homage to an aged seat, Small in itself, but in its owner great; Where Chaucer (sacred name!) whole years employ'd, Coy Nature courted, and at length enjoy'd; Mov'd at his suit, the naked goddess came, Reveal'd her charms, and recompens'd his flame. Rome's pious king with like success retir'd, And taught his people, what his Nymph inspir'd. Hence flow descriptions regularly fine, And beauties such as never can decline: Each lively image makes the reader start, And poetry invades the painter's art. This Dryden saw, and with his wonted fate (Rich in himself) endeavour'd to translate; Took wond'rous pains to do the author wrong, And set to modern tune his ancient song. Cadence, and sound, which we so prize, and use, Ill suit the majesty of Chaucer's Muse; His language only can his thoughts express, Old honest Clytus scorns the Persian dress. Inimitable bard! In raptures loud I would thy praises tell, And on th'inspiring theme for ever dwell, Did not the maid, whose wond'rous beauty seen, Inflam'd great Henry, and incens'd his queen, With pleasing sorrow move me to survey A neighb'ring structure, aweful in decay, For ever sacred, and in ruin blest, Which heretofore contain'd that lovely guest. Admiring strangers, who attentive come To learn the tale of this romantic dome, By faithful monuments instructed, view (Tho' time should spare) what civil rage can do. Where landskips once, in rich apartments high, Through various prospects led the wand'ring eye: Where painted rivers flow'd through flow'ry meads, And hoary mountains rear'd their aweful heads: Or where by hands of curious virgins wrought, In rich array embroider'd heroes fought: Now hemloek thrives, and weeds of pow'rful charms O'er ragged walls extend their baleful arms. Monsters obscene their pois'nous roots invade, And bloated pant beneath the gloomy shade. Thus noblest buildings are with ease effac'd, And what's well wrote alone, will always last. Ev'n Vanbrugh's frame, that does so brightly shine In rules exact, and greatness of design, Would fall a victim to devouring age, Had not that hand, which built, adorn'd the stage. Wit so refin'd without the poet's pain, Such artful scenes in such a flowing vein, O'er latest æras deathless will prevail, When Doric and Corinthian orders fail; When each proud pyramid its height foregoes, And sinks beneath the base on which it rose. Ye British fair, whose names but mention'd, give Worth to the tale, and make the poem live; Vouchsafe to hear, whilst briefly I relate Great Henry's flame, and Rosamonda's fate. Pierc'd to the soul by her resistless eyes, Lo! at her feet the scepter'd vassal lies, Now big with hopes, now tortur'd with despair, Nor toils, nor pleasures, can divert his care. Her voice, her look, ten thousand wounds impart, And fix the pleasing image in his heart; Such as (if Fame has drawn the picture true, Her native lustre sung, nor added new) Might tempt the thund'rer from his bless'd abode, To court that beauty which himself bestow'd. Features so wrought not Venus' self displays, When dress'd by youthful pens in vocal lays; Not equal charms in all the Graces join, And only Sunderland is more divine. Thus fatally adorn'd, the hapless fair Receives his suit, and listens to his prayer; Fond of her ruin, pleas'd to be undone, She reaps the conquest that her eyes had won. Tho' tongues obscure, at humble distance plac'd, May censure joys which they despair to taste; Whene'er th'attack is made, all jointly own What bright temptations sparkle from a throne: Could love no entrance find, ambition can, They clasp the monarch who despise the man; Beyond his boldest wish the hero bless'd, Riots in joys too great to be express'd; And now, with caution, does the means pursue, As they are great, to make them lasting too. 'Mid shades obscure, remote from vulgar eye, An artful edifice is rear'd on high, Through which inextricable windings run, Lost in themselves, and end where they begun. Mæander thus, as ancient stories feign, In curling channels wander'd o'er the plain; Oft by himself o'ertook, himself survey'd, And backward turning, to his fountain stray'd. Nor much unlike to these are mazes found, By loit'ring hinds imprinted on the ground; Who, when releas'd by some distinguish'd day, Lead ruddy damsels forth to rural play; And on the flow'ry vale, or mountain's brow, The yielding glebe in wanton furrows plow. Ye Sylvan Nymphs, who with a pleasing pride, O'er shady groves, and secret vows preside, On this mysterious pile with care attend, Protect the mistress, and the prince befriend: With both conspire to blind the wary dame, And screen th'important tale from babbling Fame. Ah faithless guards! in vain with od'rous smoke We feast your altars, and your aid invoke; When nuptial debts are now no longer paid, More ways than one the rover is betray'd: Affected passion does no more suffice, And aukward kindness proves a weak disguise. Woman, by nature arm'd against deceit, With indignation smiles upon the cheat; Looks down with scorn, and only burns to know Th'uncertain author of her certain woe. As a fierce lioness of Lybian race, Struck by the hunter's hand, with furious pace Strides o'er the sands, and red with recent gore Yells out her pain, and makes the forest roar: So raves the queen incens'd; and loudly tells The restless grief that in her bosom dwells, For her lov'd lord from her embraces fled, Her slighted beauty, and her widow'd bed. What dire effects her kindled fury wrought, Whether by pointed steel, or poison'd draught, Th'unguarded rival fell, forbear to ask, Th'unwilling Muse declines the mournful task, Recoils with anguish, wounded to the soul, Feels ev'ry stab, and drinks th'invenom'd bowl. Thee, beauteous fair, Love made a pris'ner here, But great Eliza's doom was more severe; By hate implacable to shades confin'd, Where still the native grandeur of her mind Clear and unsully'd shone, with radiant grace Gilding the dusky horrors of the place. No nobler gifts can heav'n itself pour down, Than to deserve, and to despise a crown. In some dark room, for pompous sorrow made, Methinks I see the royal virgin laid; With anxious thoughts employ'd on former times, Their various fate, their glory, and their crimes; Th'ill-boding place a just concernment gives, Since Elinora in Maria lives. Maria—but forgotten be her name, In long oblivion lost, o'erlook'd by fame. Do thou, O Albion, from remembrance chace Thy persecuted sons, thy martyr'd race: And freed at length by Anna's milder ray, From furious zeal, and arbitrary sway, Enjoy the present, or the future scene, With promis'd blessings fraught, without one cloud serene. Stop, goddess, stop, recall thy daring flight, I cannot, must not tempt the wond'rous height. Themes so exalted, with proportion'd wing, Let Addison, let Garth, let Congreve sing; Whilst list'ning nations crowd the vocal lyre, Foretaste their bliss, and languish with desire. To thee thy song, thy province is assign'd, And what should foremost stand, is yet behind. Silenc'd be all antiquity could boast, And let old Woodstock in the new be lost. No more her Edwards, or her Henrys please; Their spoils of war, or monuments of peace: By Churchill's hand so largely is out-done, What either prince has built, and both have won. With admiration struck, we gaze around, The fancy entertain, the sense confound: And whilst our eyes o'er the foundation roam, Presage the wonders of the finish'd dome. Thus did our hero's early dawn display Th'auspicious beams of his advancing day. We, who in humble cells, and learn'd retreat, Are strangers to the splendor of the great, On barren cliffs of speculation thrown, Of all besides unknowing, and unknown, Pronounce our fabrics just in ev'ry part, And scorn the poor attempts of modern art; (Proud of his cottage so exults the swain, Who loves the forest, and admires the plain,) 'Till here convinc'd, unwillingly we find Our Wickhams, and our Wainfleets, left behind; Far as the molehill by the mountain's brow, Or shrubs by cedars, in whose shade they grow. Rise, glorious pile, the princess bids thee rise, And claim thy title to her kindred skies: Where she presides all must be nobly great, All must be regular, and all compleat; No other hand the mighty work requires, Art may inform, but she alone inspires. When lab'ring Tyrians, with united toil, Advanc'd their Carthage on the destin'd soil, So sate their queen, and look'd auspicious down, Herself the Genius of the rising town. Thrice happy he, to whom the task shall fall, To grace with shining images the wall; And in bold colours silently rehearse, What soars above the reach of humble verse. No fam'd exploits, from musty annals brought, Shall share his art, or furnish out the draught; No foreign heroes in triumphant cars, No Latian victories, nor Græcian wars: Germania's fruitful fields alone afford Work for the pencil, harvest for the sword. Her well-drawn fights with horror shall surprize, And clouds of smoke upon the canvas rise; Rivers distain'd shall reeking currents boast, And wind in crimson waves the plunging host; Each mortal pang be seen, each dying throe, And Death look grim in all the pomp of woe. But far, oh far distinguish'd from the rest! By youth, by beauty, and a waving crest, Like young Patroclus, Dormer shall be slain, And great Achilles' soul be shock'd again. Successful Kneller, whose improving air Adds light to light, and graces to the fair, Thus may compleat the glories of his age, And in one piece the whole soft sex engage; Who shall in crowds the lovely dead surround, And weep rich gems upon his streaming wound; By sad remembrance urg'd to fruitless moan, And lost in Dormer's charms, neglect their own. Yet artist stop not here, but boldly dare Next to design, what next deserves thy care. 'Midst British squadrons awefully serene, On rising ground let Marlborough be seen, With his drawn faulchion light'ning on the foe, Prepar'd to strike the great decisive blow; While phlegmatic allies his vengeance stay, By absence these, and by their presence they. Ill-fated Gauls to 'scape his thunder so, And by a short reprieve inhance their woe! When they in arms again the combat try, Again their troops in wild disorder fly, No usual ties of clemency shall bind, No temper shall assuage the victor's mind: But heaps on heaps attone the fatal wrong, And rage unbounded drive the storm along. Legions of foes resistless shall advance O'er prostrate mounds, to shock the power of France, Their loud demands to proud Lutetia tell, And rouze th'inglorious tyrant from his cell. Then provinces releas'd shall break their chain, Forego their bondage, and forget their pain. Iberia, with extended arms, shall run To liberty, to life, to Austria's son; And by mild councils generously sway'd, Own thy example, Anna! and thy aid; Whole kingdoms shall be bless'd, all Europe free, And lift her hands unmanacled to Thee. A Fit of the SPLEEN. In Imitation of Shakesphear. By Dr. IBBOT. Farewel, vain world! and thou its vainest part, O lovely woman! fram'd for man's destruction! Beauty, like nightshade to the teeming wife, If seen, gives wishes restless, endless longings; If tasted, death. Too hard decree of fate, That life must be a burthen, or must end! Farewel, vain world! dwelling of ills and fears, Full of fond hopes, false joys, and sad repentance; For tho' sometimes warm Fancy lights a fire, That mounting upwards darts its pointed head Up, thro' the unopposing air, to heav'n, Yet then comes Thought, and cold Consideration, Lame Afterthought with endless scruples fraught, Benumm'd with Fears, to damp the goodly blaze. Farewel, vain world!—Yet, ere I die, I'll find Contentment's seat, unknown to guilt or sorrow; Haste then, for nimble Death pursues me close, Methinks I hear his steps, tho' trod in air; My fluttering soul seems like a bird entrapp'd, That beats his wings against the prison walls, And fain wou'd be at liberty again; And oft the death-watch with ill-boding beats Hath warn'd me that my time wou'd soon expire, And that life's thread, ne'er to be wound up more, Wou'd by the spring of fate be quickly drawn To its full stretch—Haste then, and let me find A shelter, that may shut out noise and light, Save one dim taper, whose neglected snuff, Grown higher than the flame, shall with its bulk Almost extinguish it; no noise be there, But that of water, ever friend to thought. Hail, gloomy shade! th'abode of modesty Void of deceit; no glittering objects here Dazzle the eyes; and thou, delightful Silence, Silence, the great Divinity's discourse! The angels' language, and the hermits' pride, The help of waking wisdom, and its food; In thee philosophers have justly plac'd The sovereign good; free from the broken vows, The calumnies, reproaches, and the lies Of which the noisy babbling world complains. These four lines are said to be added by Mr. Pope.So the struck deer, with some deep wound opprest, Lies down to die, the arrow in his breast; There hid in shades, and wasting day by day, Inly he bleeds, and pants his life away. HYMN to Miss LAURENCE, in the Pump-Room. Bath, 1753. The attribution of this poem is questionable. Naiad of this healthful stream, Fair Laurentia, if I deem Rightly of thy office here, If the theme may please thine ear, Listen gracious to my lays, While the springs of Health I praise: Nor will less thy glory shine, If their praise I blend with thine. For of their renown of old Stories many Fame hath told: Ancient bards their name have sung Heroes, kings, and gods among, And with various titles grac'd, While their fountain-head they trac'd. Whether See Mr. Selden's notes on the third song of Drayton's Polyolbion, where, in an ancient fragment of rhimes, are enumerated all the ingredients which Bladud imploy'd in making the baths. Bladud, king of yore, Skill'd in philosophic lore, Mingling various kinds of earth, Metallic, gave the waters birth, King's-Bath nam'd, beneath thy feet Boiling ay with mineral heat: Or, whether from his car on high Phœbus saw with amorous eye The fountain-nymph, with humid train, Light of foot, trip o'er the plain; Strait the god, inflam'd with love, Swift descending from above, All in fervors bright array'd Press'd her bosom; and the maid Gladly to his warm embrace Yielded: whence the happy place, Where the nymph he woo'd and won, Was call'd the Aquæ solis. Bath. Sol in hâc urbe templum habuit, et nomen quod exhibet Antoninus, loco dedit. Antonini Iter XIV. publish'd by Gale. Waters of the Sun. Fame that title widely spred; Yet, ere Roman legions fled The wrath of sturdy British knights, Pallas claim'd religious rights; British Pallas etiam, teste Solino, fontibus hisce fuit præsul, suamque habuit ædem, ubi et perpetuos ignes. Ab eâ, appellabatur Britannis, Caer Palladour: Urbs aquæ Palladiæ. Ibid. Palladour then rose, From the goddess nam'd, who chose Near the favourite streams to dwell, Guardian of the sacred well. But long since The goddess of health. Hygeia fair Under her peculiar care Receiv'd the springs; for well she knows Each salubrious rill that flows Forth from subterranean vaults, Stor'd by Nature's hand with salts, Steel, or sulphur: for her use Nature opens every sluice, Which Hygeia gives in charge To sev'ral nymphs: herself at large Roams o'er hill, and dale, and plain, Lacky'd by a duteous train; Oreads, Naiads, Dryads pay Service glad: some smooth her way, Or mists disperse, or brush the trees; Others waft the morning-breeze From mountain-tops: adown the hills Others pour refreshing rills, Or bathe her limbs in fountain neat, Aiding, all, her influence sweet. She with smiling eye surveys Rustic labours, and conveys Strength to the active thresher's arm, To village-maidens Beauty's charm. Happy are the sons of earth Whom the goddess at their birth Shin'd on. Yet, her heavenly ray Numbers, not respecting, stray From her presence, and pursue Luxury's paths, whose sordid crew, Lust inordinate, and Sloth, And Gluttony's unwieldy growth, Lead them on to Shame, and Pain, And Maladies, an endless train. Oft with pangs distracting torn They Hygeia's absence mourn; Bitter change! their languid eyes Feel not joy in sunny skies; Nor doth Night, with slumber blest, Close them at the hour of rest. And oft with sighs, and tears, and pray'r Half-suppress'd by sad despair, They the queen of health implore Her wish'd presence to restore. Nor unmindful of their woes Is the goddess; for she chose Thee, Laurentia, loveliest maid Among thy sister nymphs, who play'd On the banks of The river which runs by Bath. Avon, Thee, Bright-ey'd nymph, she chose to be Her substitute, and pow'r she gave Sov'reign o'er the healing wave Which thou rul'st with gentle sway. Thee the smoaking tides obey Joyous; and at thy command Wash thy The effects of the hot water. rosy-finger'd hand; Thence in crystal cups convey'd Yield their salutary aid To all, whom Thou with look benign Smil'st on round Hygeia's shrine; All of appetite deprav'd, Those whom pale-ey'd Spleen enslav'd, Cripples bent with gouty pain, Whom Jaundice ting'd with muddy stain, Or whose frame of nerves, with stroke Benumming, tremulous Palsy broke. These the balmy, cordial stream Quaff, rejoicing; Thee, their theme Of praise, extol; thy tender care, Thy foft address, and courteous air: And while The music in the pump-room, Harmony, the friend Of Health, delights to recommend Thy ministry, thy charms inspire Love and joy, and gay desire: For the goddess, when she gave Rule imperial o'er the wave, To adorn the gift, and grace thy state, On Thee bade Youth and Beauty wait. Nor dost thou not taste delight Where thou sit'st in duteous plight; For the joy, thy hand bestows, Back to thee redounding flows, When the cheek of faded hue, Thou seest displaying roses new. Thee suspended Over Bladud's image in the king's bath hang many crutches, crutches please, Signal trophies from Disease Won to Health victorious. Hail, Comfort, and support of frail Human state! Hail, blooming maid! Nymph belov'd! without thy aid, He, who, greeting thee, his lays Now attunes to notes of praise, Mute had been, oppress'd with pain Of spasm rheumatic. Hail again, Priestess of Hygeia's shrine! Sitll dispense her gift divine, Still her vot'ries lead to Health; Else, what profits Marlborough's wealth, Lady Betty Spencer. ????????? ??? ???????? ?? ???????? ???? ????????? ?????? ?? ???????? Lucian. Eliza's form, and Stanhope's wit, And all the eloquence of Pitt? A Letter to Corinna from a Captain in Country Quarters. My earliest flame, to whom I owe All that a captain needs to know; Dress, and quadrille, and air, and chat, Lewd songs, loud laughter, and all that; Arts that have widows oft subdued, And never fail'd to win a prude; Think, charmer, how I live forlorn At quarters, from Corinna torn. Nor more distress the cornet feels From gruel, and Ward's popish pills. What shall I do now you're away, To kill that only foe, the day? The landed 'squire, and dull freeholder, Are sure no comrades for a soldier; To drink with parsons all day long, Misaubin tells me wou'd be wrong: Sober advice, and Curl's Dutch whore I've read, 'till I can read no more. At noon I rise, and strait alarm A sempstress' shop, or country farm; Repuls'd, my next pursuit is a'ter The parson's wife, or landlord's daughter: At market oft for game I search, Oft at assemblies, oft at church, And plight my faith and gold to-boot; Yet demme if a soul will do't— In short our credit's sunk so low, Since troops were kept o'foot for shew, She that for soldiers once run mad, Is turn'd republican, egad! And when I boast my feats, the shrew Asks who was slain the last review. Know then, that I and captain Trueman Resolve to keep a miss—in common: Not her, among the batter'd lasses, Such as our friend Toupét caresses, But her, a nymph of polish'd sense, Which pedants call impertinence: Train'd up to laugh, and drink, and swear, And railly with the prettiest air— Amidst our frolicks and carouses How shall we pity wretched spouses! But where can this dear soul be found, In garret high, or under ground? If so divine a fair there be, Charming Corinna, thou art she. But oh! what motives can persuade Belles, to prefer a rural shade, In this gay month, when pleasures bloom, The park, the play—the drawing room— Lo! birthnights upon birthnights tread, Term is begun, the lawyer fee'd; My friend the merchant, let me tell ye, Calls in his way to Farinelli; Add that my sattin gown and watch Some unfledg'd booby 'squire may catch, Who, charm'd with his delicious quarry, May first debauch me, and then marry; Never was season more befitting Since conv?ns last were sitting. And shall I leave dear Charing-cross, And let two boys my charms ingross? Leave play-house, temple, and the rummer? A country friend might serve in summer! The town's your choice—yet, charming fair, Observe what ills attend you there. Captains, that once admir'd your beauty, Are kept by quality on duty; Cits, for attoning alms disburse A tester—templars, something worse: My lord may take you to his bed, But then he sends you back unpaid; And all you gain from generous cully, Must go to keep some Irish bully. Pinchbeck demands the tweezer case, And Monmouth-street the gown and stays; More mischiefs yet come crowding on, Bridewell,—West Indies—and Sir John— Then oh! to lewdness bid adieu, And chastly live, confin'd to two. A TALE. By Mr. MERRICK. If Virtue prompt thy willing mind To actions gen'rous, good and kind; Fortune beyond thy hopes shall bless Thy toils, and crown them with success: But he whose bounties only rise From prospects of a future prize, With sorrow shall compute his gains, And reap repentance for his pains. Precepts are often found to fail, So take instruction from my tale. In ancient days there liv'd a priest, Inshrin'd within whose pious breast Fair Virtue shone; his open look Gave sanction to each word he spoke. Fix'd to no home, in mean array, From place to place he took his way, Instructing as he went along, And dealing blessings to the throng. The truth he labour'd to express, In language plain as was his dress; Yet all with secret rapture hung On every accent of his tongue: A silent eloquence there ran Through all the actions of the man; They mark'd his soul's unblemish'd frame, His precept and his life the same. It chanc'd, as musing once he stray'd, Around him night's descending shade Unheeded stole; through paths unknown With darkling steps he wander'd on, And wish'd to shroud his weary head Beneath some hospitable shed. When through the gloom a sudden ray Sprung forth, and shot across the way. Led by the light, a cott he found: A pious dame the mansion own'd, Whose open heart, tho' small her store, Ne'er turn'd the stranger from her door. Think at the sight of such a guest, What transport rose within her breast: With joy the friendly board she spread, And plac'd him in her warmest bed. Deep sunk in sleep the trav'ler lay, Tir'd with the labours of the day. 'Tis best, as ablest critics deem, To suit your language to your theme; Obsequious to their rules, the Muse In humbler strain her tale pursues. The matron, while her thankful guest Had shar'd with her the slender feast, With curious eye had view'd him o'er, Had mark'd the tatter'd garb he wore, And through the yawning frieze had seen No traces of a shirt within. And now her hands with pious care A shirt of home-spun cloth prepare: 'Twas coarse, but would the longer hold, And serve to fence him from the cold. The toil employ'd her all the night, And ended with the rising light. The priest arose at break of day, And hasten'd to pursue his way; With thanks he took the finish'd vest, The hospitable dame he bless'd, “And that thy charity, he said, “May fall with int'rest on thy head, “May thy first work, when I am gone, “Continue 'till the setting sun.” She heard; but soon her houshold care Had banish'd from her thoughts the pray'r; The remnant of her cloth she took, And measur'd out her little stock. Beneath her hands the length'ning piece Surpriz'd her with a vast increase; Astonish'd at a sight so new, She measur'd still and still it grew. As when in sleep, with winged pace O'er hills and plains we urge the race, With eager hopes we onward bend, And think our labour near its end; But mimick Fancy soon supplies New scenes to cheat our wond'ring eyes: Before our feet new plains extend, New vallies sink, new hills ascend, And still the goal, when these are o'er, Appears as distant as before. In such a dream with such surprize, From morn to eve the woman plies Her task; but when the setting ray Had clos'd her labour with the day, With joy the wond'rous heap survey'd, And saw her bounty well repay'd. A neighb'ring dame, the story known, Much wish'd to make the case her own; For tho' she ne'er was seen before To lodge the stranger or the poor, She wisely thought on one so good Her charity were well bestow'd. As by her door his journey lay, She stop'd the trav'ler on his way; Beg'd him to enter and receive Such welcome as her house could give: The priest comply'd, and ent'ring found The board with various plenty crown'd; On heaps of down he past the night, And slumber'd 'till the morning light. At break of day the dame address'd In friendly guise her rev'rend guest: Linen so coarse, she said, was ne'er Design'd for Christian backs to wear; And as it griev'd her to survey Such virtue in so mean array, Herself had toil'd with sleepless eyes To furnish him with fresh supplies: Fine was the texture, such as comes From wealthy Holland's skilful looms. The priest accepts the proffer'd boon, He thanks her for her kindness shown, And grateful as he leaves her door, Repeats the pray'r he made before. Just parted from the holy man, With eager haste the matron ran To reach her cloth, and had design'd To measure what was left behind; But thinking first, that as the pray'r For the whole day had fix'd her care, One labour would employ it all, And leave no time for Nature's call, Ere to the destin'd work she goes, She deems it best to pluck a rose. The hissing geese, as forth she went, Gave omens of the dire event; The herds, that graz'd the neighb'ring plain, Look'd up, and snuff'd the coming rain; The bird that screams at midnight hours, (Diviner of approaching show'rs) Full on the left, with hideous croak, Stood flutt'ring on a blasted oak. Amazement seiz'd the trembling dame, When first she saw the plenteous stream: She wonder'd much, and much she fear'd; And think how Niobe appear'd, When chang'd into a rock she stood, And at her feet the headlong flood, With downward force impetuous ran, High foaming, o'er the delug'd plain; So look'd the dame, when all around The torrent smoak'd upon the ground: Still spreading wider than before, It seem'd a sea without a shore. Your bards that wrote in heathen days, Had such a theme employ'd their lays, Had tortur'd their inventive brain, With dire portents to fill the strain; Had bid the neighb'ring river mourn His alter'd stream and tainted urn; Or made the Naiads lift their heads, Astonish'd from their wat'ry beds, And, seated on the river's side, Squeeze from their locks the briny tide. But little skill'd in Pagan lore; I pass such idle fancies o'er: Truth is my care, whose lovely face Shines brightest in the plainest dress. At eve the torrent stopt its course; Stung with vexation and remorse; The dame laments her fruitless cost, Her hopes deceiv'd, her labour lost. Nor think that here her suff'rings end, Reproach and infamy attend: Surrounding boys, where-e'er she came, With insults loud divulge her shame; And farmers stop her with demands Of recompence for damag'd lands. The WISH. By the Same. How short is life's uncertain space! Alas! how quickly done! How swift the wild precarious chace! And yet how difficult the race! How very hard to run! Youth stops at first its wilful ears To Wisdom's prudent voice; Till now arriv'd to riper years, Experienc'd age worn out with cares Repents its earlier choice. What though its prospects now appear So pleasing and refin'd; Yet groundless hope, and anxious fear, By turns the busy moments share, And prey upon the mind. Since then false joys our fancy cheat With hopes of real bliss; Ye guardian pow'rs that rule my fate, The only wish that I create, Is all compris'd in this. May I through life's uncertain tide, Be still from pain exempt; May all my wants be still supply'd, My state too low t'admit of pride, And yet above contempt. But should your Providence divine A greater bliss intend; May all those blessings you design, (If e'er those blessings shall be mine) Be center'd in a friend. The Bears and Bees. A FABLE. By the Same. As two young Bears in wanton mood, Forth-issuing from a neighbouring wood, Came where th'industrious Bees had stor'd In artful cells their luscious hoard; O'erjoy'd they seiz'd with eager haste Luxurious on the rich repast. Alarm'd at this the little crew About their ears vindictive flew. The beasts unable to sustain Th'unequal combat, quit the plain; Half blind with rage, and mad with pain; Their native shelter they regain; There sit, and now discreeter grown, Too late their rashness they bemoan; And this by dear experience gain, That pleasure's ever bought with pain. So when the gilded baits of vice Are plac'd before our longing eyes, With greedy haste we snatch our fill, And swallow down the latent ill; But when experience opes our eyes, Away the fancy'd pleasure flies. It flies, but oh! too late we find It leaves a real sting behind. A FRAGMENT. By the Same. When recent in the womb I lay, Ere yet my life began, Thy care preserv'd the sleeping clay, And form'd it into man. Oh! may this frame, that rising grew Beneath thy plastic hands, Be studious ever to pursue Whate'er thy will commands. The soul that moves this earthly load Thy semblance let it bear; Nor lose the traces of the God, Who stamp'd his image there. The CAMELION: A Fable after Monsieur de la Motte. By the Same. Oft has it been my lot to mark A proud, conceited, talking spark, With eyes, that hardly serv'd at most To guard their master 'gainst a post, Yet round the world the blade has been To see whatever cou'd be seen, Returning from his finish'd tour, Grown ten times perter than before; Whatever word you chance to drop, The travell'd fool your mouth will stop, “Sir, if my judgment you'll allow— “I've seen—and sure I ought to know— So begs you'd pay a due submission, And acquiesce in his decision. Two travellers of such a cast; As o'er Arabia's wild they past, And on their way in friendly chat Now talk'd of this and then of that, Discours'd awhile 'mongst other matter Of the Camelion's form and nature. “A stranger animal, cries one, “Sure never liv'd beneath the sun. “A lizard's body lean and long, “A fish's head, a serpent's tongue, “Its tooth with triple claw disjoin'd; “And what a length of tail behind! “How slow its pace, and then its hue— “Who ever saw so fine a blue?” “Hold there, the other quick replies, “'Tis green—I saw it with these eyes, “As late with open mouth it lay, “And warm'd it in the sunny ray; “Stretch'd at its ease the beast I view'd, “And saw it eat the air for food.” “I've seen it, Sir, as well as you, “And must again affirm it blue. “At leisure I the beast survey'd “Extended in the cooling shade.” “'Tis green, 'tis green, Sir, I assure ye— “Green! cries the other in a fury— “Why, Sir—d'ye think I've lost my eyes?” “'Twere no great loss, the friend replies, “For, if they always serve you thus, “You'll find 'em but of little use.” So high at last the contest rose, From words they almost came to blows: When luckily came by a third— To him the question they refer'd; And beg'd he'd tell 'em, if he knew, Whether the thing was green or blue. “Sirs, cries the umpire, cease your pother— “The creature's neither one nor t'other. “I caught the animal last night, “And view'd it o'er by candle-light: “I mark'd it well—'twas black as jet— “You stare—but Sirs, I've got it yet, “And can produce it.” “Pray, Sir, do: “I'll lay my life, the thing is blue.” “And I'll be sworn, that when you've seen “The reptile, you'll pronounce him green.” “Well then, at once to ease the doubt, “Replies the man, I'll turn him out: “And when before your eyes I've set him, “If you don't find him black, I'll eat him.” He said; then full before their sight Produc'd the beast, and lo! 'twas white.— Both star'd, the man look'd wond'rous wise— “My children,” the Camelion cries, (Then first the creature found a tongue) “You all are right, and all are wrong: “When next you talk of what you view, “Think others see, as well as you: “Nor wonder, if you find that none “Prefers your eye-sight to his own.” Immortality: or, the Consolation of Human Life. A Monody. By THOMAS DENTON, M. A. ? Animi natura videtur Atque animæ claranda meis jam versibus esse: Et metus ille foras præceps Acheruntis agendus Funditus, humanam qui vitam turbat ab imo, Omnia suffundus mortis nigrore. Lucr. I When black-brow'd Night her dusky mantle spread, And wrapt in solemn gloom the sable sky; When soothing Sleep her opiate dews had shed, And seal'd in silken slumbers ev'ry eye: My wakeful thoughts admit no balmy rest, Nor the sweet bliss of soft oblivion share; But watchful woe distracts my aching breast, My heart the subject of corroding care: From haunts of men with wand'ring steps and slow I solitary steal, and sooth my pensive woe. II Yet no fell passion's rough discordant rage Untun'd the music of my tranquil mind; Ambition's tinsell'd charms could ne'er engage, No harbour there could sordid av'rice find: From lust's foul spring my grief disdains to flow, No sighs of envy from my bosom break, But soft compassion melts my soul to woe, And social tears fast trickle down my cheek; Ah me! when nature gives one general groan, Each heart must beat with woe, each voice responsive moan. III Where'er I cast my moist'ned eyes around, Or stretch my prospect o'er the distant land, There foul Corruption's tainted steps are found, And Death grim-visag'd waves his iron hand. Tho' now soft Pleasure gild the smiling scene, And sportive Joy call forth her festive train, Sinking in night each vital form is seen, Like air-blown bubbles on the wat'ry plain; Vid. Virg. Æn. lib. 3. ver. 210. &amp; seq.Fell Death, like brooding Harpy, the repast Will snatch with talons foul, or sour its grateful taste. IV Ye smiling glories of the youthful year, That ope your fragrant bosoms to the day, That clad in all the pride of spring appear, And steep'd in dew your silken leaves display: In Nature's richest robes tho' thus bedight, Tho' her soft pencil trace your various dye, Tho' lures your roseate hue the charmed sight, Tho' odours sweet your nect'rous breath supply, Soon on your leaves Time's cank'rous tooth shall prey, Your dulcet dews exhale, your beauteous bloom decay. V Ye hedge-row elms, beneath whose spreading shade The grazing herds defy the ratt'ling shower; Ye lofty oaks, in whose wide arms display'd The clam'rous rook builds high his airy bower; Stript by hoar Winter's rough inclement rage, In mournful heaps your leafy honours lie, Ev'n your hard ribs shall feel the force of age, And your bare trunks the friendly shade deny; No more by cheerful vegetation green, Your sapless bolls shall sink, and quit th'evanid scene. VI Ye feather'd warblers of the vernal year That careless sing, nor fear the frowns of fate, Tune your sad notes to death and winter drear! Ill suit these mirthful strains your transient state. No more with cheerful song nor sprightly air Salute the blushes of the rising day, With doleful ditties, drooping wings repair To the lone covert of the nightly spray: Where love-lorn Philomela strains her throat, Surround the budding thorn, and swell the mournful note. VII Come, sighing Elegy, with sweetest airs Of melting music teach my grief to flow, I too must mix my sad complaint with theirs, Our fates are equal, equal be our woe. Come, Melancholy, spread thy raven wing, And in thy ebon car, by Fancy led, To the dark charnel vault thy vot'ry bring, The murky mansions of the mould'ring dead, Where dank dews breathe, and taint the sickly skies, Where in sad loathsome heaps all human glory lies. VIII Wrapt in the gloom of uncreated night Secure we slept in senseless matter's arms, Nor pain could vex, nor pallid fear affright, Our quiet fancy felt no dream's alarms. Soon as to life our animated clay Awakes, and conscious being opes our eyes, Care's fretful family at once dismay, With ghastly air a thousand phantoms rise, Sad Horror hangs o'er all the deep'ning gloom, Grief prompts the labour'd sigh, Death opes the marble tomb. IX Yet life's strong love intoxicates the soul, And thirst of bliss inflames the fev'rous mind, With eager draughts we drain the pois'nous bowl, And in the dregs the cordial hope to find. O heav'n! for this light end were mortals made, And plac'd on earth, with happiness in view, To catch with cheated grasp the flitting shade, And with vain toil the fancied form pursue, Then give their short-liv'd being to the wind, As the wing'd arrow flies, and leaves no track behind! X Thus lonely wand'ring thro' the nightly shade Against the stern decrees of stubborn Fate, To mockful Echo my complaints I made, Of life's short period, or its toilsome state. 'Tis death-like silence all, no sound I hear, Save the hoarse raven croaking from the sky, Or scaly beetle murm'ring thro' the air, Or screech-owl screaming with ill-omen'd cry; Save when with brazen tongue from yon high tow'r The clock deep-sounding speaks, and counts the passing hour. XI Pale Cynthia mounted on her silver car O'er heav'n's blue concave drives her nightly round: See a torn abbey, wrapt in gloom, appear Scatter'd in wild confusion o'er the ground. Here rav'nous Ruin lifts her wasteful hands O'er bri'ar-grown grots and bramble-shaded graves; Safe from her wrath one weeping marble stands, O'er which the mournful yew its umbrage waves; Ope, ope thy pond'rous jaws, thou friendly tomb, Close the sad deathful scene, and shroud me in thy womb! XII Forth issuing lovely from the gloomy shade, Which stately pines in phalanx deep compose, Fair above mortals comes a smiling maid To sooth my sighs, and cheer my heart-felt woes. Here nurs'd by Contemplation, matron sage, Where with mute Solitude she loves to dwell, In truth's fair lore she form'd her early age, And trim'd the midnight lamp in lonely cell, Here learn'd clear reason's heav'n-sprung light to raise O'er passion's low-born mists, or pleasure's spurious blaze. XIII Her azure mantle flows with easy grace, Nor fashion's folds constrain, nor custom's tye; An optic tube she bears, each sphere to trace That rolls its rapid orbit round the sky: Yet not to heav'n alone her view's confin'd; A clear reflecting plane she holds, to show The various movements of the reas'ning mind, How strange ideas link, and habits grow, Passion's fierce impulse, will's free power to scan, To paint the featur'd soul, and mark th'internal man. XIV Whence these sad strains, said she, of plaintive grief, Which pierce the sleep-clos'd ear of peaceful rest? Oft has the sick'ning mind here found relief, Here quell'd the throbbing tumults of the breast: Lift up thy loaden eyes to yon fair cloud, Where moon-sprung A rainbow form'd by the rays of the moon at night: an object often visible, tho' from its languid colours not often observ'd. Iris blends her beauteous dyes: I lift them soon, and as I gazing stood, The fleeting phantom in a moment flies; Where beam'd the gilded arch of gaudy hue, Frowns the dark lou'ring cloud all gloomy to the view. XV Life's emblem fit, said I, that roscid bow! The gay illusive pageant of an hour To real semblance tricks her air shew, Then sinks in night's dull arms, and is no more! Ah! fool, said she, tho' now to fancy's sight The violet pale, the blushing red decays, Tho' now no painted cloud reflect the light, Nor drops prismatic break the falling rays, Yet still the colours live, tho' none appear, Glow in the darting beam that gilds yon crystal sphere. XVI Then let not Fancy with her vagrant blaze Mislead in trackless paths of wild deceit; On Reason's steady lamp still ardent gaze; Led by her sober light to Truth's retreat. Tho' wond'ring Ign'rance sees each form decay, The breathless bird, bare trunk, and shrivel'd flow'r: New forms successive catch the vital ray, Sing their wild notes, or smile th'allotted hour, And search creation's ample circuit round, Tho' modes of being change, all life's immortal found. XVII See the slow reptile grov'ling o'er the green, That trails thro' slimy paths its cumbrous load, Start in new beauty from the lowly scene, And wing with flutt'ring pride th'ætherial road; Burst their shell-prisons, see the feather'd kind, Where in dark durance pent awhile they lie, Dispread their painted plumage to the wind, Brush the brisk air, swift shooting thro' the sky, Hail with their choral hymns the new-born day, Distend their joy-swoln breasts, and carol the sweet lay. XVIII See man by varied periods fixt by fate Ascend perfection's scale by slow degree; The plant-like fœtus quits its senseless taste, And helpless hangs sweet-smiling on the knee; Soon outward objects steal into the brain, Next prattling childhood lisps with mimic air, Then mem'ry links her fleet ideal train, And sober reason rises to compare, The full-grown breast some manly passion warms, It pants for glory's meed, or beats to love's alarms. XIX Then say, since nature's high behest appears That living forms should change of being prove, In which new joy the novel scene endears, New objects rise to please, new wings to move; Since man too, taught by sage experience, knows His frame revolving treads life's varying stage, That the man-plant first vegetating grows, Then sense directs, then reason rules in age; Say, is it strange, should death's all-dreaded hour Waft to some unknown scenes, or wake some-untried pow'r? XX The wise Creator wrapt in fleshly veil The ray divine, the pure ætherial mate; Tho' worn by age the brittle fabric fail, The smiling soul survives the frowns of fate: Each circling year, each quick-revolving day Touches with mould'ring tooth thy flitting frame, With furtive slight repairs th'unseen decay; For ever changing, yet in change the same, Oft hast thou dropt unhurt thy mortal part, Dare the grim terror then, nor dread his guiltless dart. XXI The twinkling eye, whose various-humour'd round Takes in soft net th'inverted form behind, The list'ning ears, that catch the waving sound, Are but mere organs of the feeling mind: External matter thus can lend its aid, And distant shapes with foreign pow'r supply; Thus the long tube by Galilæo made Brings home the wonders of the peopled sky: The pow'r percipient then feels no decay, Tho' blind the tube, and darkness blot the visual ray. XXII When lock'd in short suspence by sleep's soft pow'r In temporary death the senses lie, When solemn silence reigns at midnight hour, Deaf the dull ear, and clos'd the curtain'd eye; Objects of sense, each conscious sense asleep, With lively image strike the wakeful soul, Some frowning rock that threats the foaming deep, Or wood-hung vale, where streams meand'ring roll, Some long-lost friend's returning voice you hear, Clasp the life-pictur'd shade, and drop the pleasing tear. XXIII Each outward organ, as ideas rise, Gives easy entrance to the motley train; Reflection calm, with retrospective eyes Surveys her treasures in the formful brain; Tho' Death relentless shed his baleful dew, In Lethe dip each form-conveying pow'r, Unhurt Reflection may her themes pursue, Smile at the ruin, safe amidst her store; Without one sense's aid in life's low vale, Fancy can furnish joys, and reason lift her scale. XXIV Thus the lone lover in the pensive shade In day-dreams rapt of soft ecstatic bliss, Pursues in thought the visionary maid, Feasts on the fancy'd smile, and favour'd kiss: Thus the young poet at the close of day Led by the magic of some fairy song Thro' the dun umbrage winds his heedless way, Nor hears the babbling brook that brawls along: Thus deathless Newton deaf to nature's cries Would measure Time and Space, and travel 'round the skies. XXV When just expiring hangs life's trembling light, And fell disease strikes deep the deadly dart, Reason and mem'ry burn with ardour bright, And gen'rous passions warm the throbbing heart; Oft will the vig'rous soul in life's last stage With keenest relish taste pure mental joys: Since the fierce efforts of distemper's rage Nor 'bates her vigour, nor her pow'rs destroys, Say, shall her lustre death itself impair? When in high noon she rides, then sets in dark despair? XXVI Tho' through the heart no purple tide should flow, No quiv'ring nerve should vibrate to the brain, The mental pow'rs no mean dependence know; Thought may survive, and each fair passion reign; As when Lucina ends the pangful strife, Lifts the young babe, and lights her lambent flame, Some pow'rs new-waking hail the dawning life, Some unsuspended live, unchang'd, the same; So from our dust fresh faculties may bloom, Some posthumous survive, and triumph o'er the tomb. XXVII This fibrous frame by nature's kindly law, Which gives each joy to keen sensation here, O'er purer scenes of bliss the veil may draw, And cloud reflection's more exalted sphere. When Death's cold hand with all-dissolving pow'r Shall the close tie with friendly stroke unbind, Alike our mortal as our natal hour May to new being raise the waking mind: On death's new genial day the soul may rise, Born to some higher life, and hail some brighter skies. XXVIII The moss-grown tree, that shrinks with rolling years, The drooping flow'rs that die so soon away, Let not thy heart alarm with boding fears, Nor thy own ruin date from their decay: The blushing rose that breathes the balmy dew, No pleasing transports of perception knows, The rev'rend oak, that circling springs renew, Thinks not, nor by long age experienc'd grows; Thy fate and theirs confess no kindred tie: Tho' their frail forms may fade, shall sense and reason die? XXIX Nor let life's ills, that in dire circle rage, Steal from thy heaving breast those labour'd sighs; These, the kind tutors of thy infant age, Train the young pupil for the future skies: Unschool'd in early prime, in riper years Wretched and scorn'd still struts the bearded boy; The tingling rod bedew'd with briny tears Shoots forth in graceful fruits of manly joy: The painful cares that vex the toilsome spring Shall plenteous crops of bliss in life's last harvest bring. XXX She ceas'd, and vanish'd into sightless wind— O'er my torn breast alternate passions sway, Now Doubt desponding damps the wav'ring mind, Now Hope reviving sheds her cheerful ray. Soon from the skies in heav'nly white array'd, Faith to my sight reveal'd, fair Cherub! stood, With life replete the volume she display'd, Seal'd with the ruddy stains of crimson blood; Each fear now starts away, as spectres fly When the sun's orient beam first gilds the purple sky. XXXI Mean while the faithful herald of the day The village cock crows loud with trumpet shrill, The warbling lark soars high, and morning grey Lifts her glad forehead o'er the cloud-wrapt hill: Nature's wild music fills the vocal vale; The bleating flocks that bite the dewy ground, The lowing herds that graze the woodland dale, And cavern'd echo, swell the cheerful sound; Homeward I bend with clear unclouded mind, Mix with the busy world, and leave each care behind. To the Memory of a GENTLEMAN, who died on his Travels to Rome. Written in 1738. By the Rev. Dr. SHIPLEY. Langton, dear partner of my soul, Accept what pious passion meditates To grace thy fate. Sad memory And grateful love, and impotent regret Shall wake to paint thy gentle mind, Thy wise good-nature, friendship delicate In secret converse, native mirth And sprightly fancy; sweet artificer Of social pleasure; nor forgot The noble thirst of knowledge and fair fame That led thee far thro' foreign climes Inquisitive: but chief the pleasant banks Of Tiber, ever-honour'd stream, Detain'd thee visiting the last remains Of ancient art; fair forms exact In sculpture, columns, and the mould'ring bulk Of theatres. In deep thought rapt Of old renown, thy mind survey'd the scenes Delighted, where the first of men Once dwelt, familiar: Scipio, virtuous chief, Stern Cato, and the patriot mind Of faithful Brutus, best philosopher. Well did the generous search employ Thy blooming years by virtue crown'd, tho' death Unseen oppress'd thee, far from home, A helpless stranger. No familiar voice, No pitying eye cheer'd thy last pangs. O worthy longest days! for thee shall flow The pious solitary tear, And thoughtful friendship sadden o'er thine urn. Captain T? of Battereau's Regiment in the Isle of Skie to Captain P? at Fort Augustus. —Come, Thomas, give us t'other sonnet— Dear captain, pray reflect upon it. Was ever so absurd a thing? What, at the pole to bid me sing! Alas! search all the mountains round, There's no Thalia to be found; And Fancy, child of southern skies, Averse the sullen region flies. I scribble verses! why you know I left the Muses long ago, Deserted all the tuneful band To right the files, and study Bland. Indeed in youth's fantastic prime Misled I wander'd into rhime, And various sonnets penn'd in plenty On ev'ry nymph from twelve to twenty; Compar'd to roses, pinks and lillies, The cheeks of Chloe and of Phillis; With all the cant you find in many A stillborn modern miscellany. My lines—how proud was I to see 'em Steal into Dodsley's new Musæum, Or in a letter fair and clean Committed to the Magazine. Our follies change—that whim is o'er— The bagatelles amuse no more. Know by these presents, that in fine I quit all commerce with the Nine. Love strains, and all poetic matters, Lampoons, epistles, odes, and satires, These toys and trifles I discard, And leave the bays to poet Ward. Know, now to politics consign'd I give up all the busy mind; Curious each pamphlet I peruse, And sip my coffee o'er the news. But a propos—for last Courant, Pray thank the lady governante. From Aix—pho! what is't—la Chapelle, Of treaties now the gazettes tell; A peace unites the jarring powers, And ev'ry trade will thrive, but our's. Farewel, as wrong'd Othello said, The plumed troops, and neighing steed! The troops! alas! more havock there A peace will make, than all the war. What crowds of heroes in a day Reduc'd to starve on half their pay! From Lowendhal 'twou'd pity meet, And Saxe himself might weep to see't. Already Fancy's active pow'r Foreruns the near approaching hour. Methinks, curs'd chance! the fatal stroke I feel, and seem already broke. The park I saunter up and down, Or sit upon a bench alone Pensive and sad—le juste portrait D'un pauvre capitaine reforme. My wig, which shun'd each ruder wind, Toupee'd before, and bag'd behind, Which John was us'd with nicest art To comb, and teach the curls to part, Lost the belle air and jaunty pride, Nor lank depends on either side: My hat grown white and rusted o'er Once bien trousse with galon d'or; My coat distain'd with dust and rain, And all my figure quite campaign. Tavern and coffee-house unwilling To give me credit for a shilling: Forbid by ev'ry scornful belle The precincts of the gay ruelle. My vows tho' breath'd in ev'ry ear, Not e'en a chambermaid will hear: No silver in my purse to pay For opera-tickets, or the play: No message sent to bid me come A fortnight after to a drum: No visits or receiv'd or pay'd, No ball, ridotto, masquerade: All pensive, heartless, and chagrine I sit, devoted prey to spleen; Shabbily fine with tarnish'd lace, And hunger pictur'd in my face. To you, dear P?, indulgent heav'n A gentler, happier lot has giv'n; To you has dealt with bounteous hands Palladian seats, and fruitful lands: Then in my sorrows have the grace To take some pity on my case; And as you know the times are hard, Send a spruce valet with a card— Your compliments, and beg I'd dine, And taste your mutton and your wine; You'll find most punctual and observant, Your most obliged humble servant, C. T. To Mr. J. H. at the Temple, occasioned by a Translation of an Epistle of Horace. 1730. By the Rev. Mr. S?, of Magdalen College, Oxford. Time flies—so you and Horace sing, From whence you many a moral bring, To teach us how to steer our lives, T'enjoy our bottles and our wives. Young man, I will approve your notions, And wholly am at your devotions. I hate your sour, canting rascals, That talk of Ember-weeks and Pascals; Black villains, who desire to wean us, From Bacchus' pleasures, and from Venus', To gain themselves a larger share, And fob us off with fast and prayer: And tell us none to Elysium go, Who do not plague themselves below. Can mis'ry raise the grateful heart, Or tuneful songs of praise impart? The great Creator's work we view And trace it out by Wisdow's clue; Nothing is good but what is true. With cautious and with thankful eye We scan the great variety: Each good within our reach we taste, And call our neighbour to the feast. Our souls do gen'rously disown All pleasure that's confin'd to one; The only rational employment Is, to receive and give emjoyment: To ev'ry pleasure we attend, Not to enjoy is to offend. But still, amidst the various crowd Of goods, that call with voices loud, Our nat'ral genius, education, Parents, companions, or our station, Direct us to some single choice, In which we chiefly must rejoice. Pleasures are ladies—some we court To pass away an hour in sport: We like them all for this or that, For silence some, and some for chat; For ev'ry one, as Cowley sings, Or arrows yields, or bows, or strings. But, after all this rambling life, Each man must have his proper wife. You know my meaning—some one good, Felt, heard, or seen, or understood, Will captivate the heart's affection, And bring the rest into subjection. Pray mind the tenor of my song; It holds together, tho' 'tis long. You've made an early choice, and wise one; The best I know within th'horizon. My lady Law is rich and handsome: May she be worth you a king's ransom! But I must tell you, (you'll excuse My friendly, tho' plain dealing Muse) In her own hands is all her dower; There's not a groat within your power; And yet you're whoring with the Nine; With them you breakfast, sup and dine, With them you spend your days and nights— Is't fitting she shou'd bear such slights? Beggarly, ballad-singing carrions, Can they advance you to the barons? You've made me too an old Tom Dingle, And I, forsooth, must try to jingle. Your lady wou'd not do you wrong; She owns you're tender yet, and young— She'd wink at now and then a song: But still expects to share the time, Which now is all bestow'd on rhime. Read in the morning Hobbes de Homine, At noon, e'en sport with your Melpomene. Youngster, I've something more to say, To wean you from this itch of play. In his Officiis old Marc Tully, 'Mongst certain points he handles fully, (A book I ever must delight in Far beyond all that since is written!)— He tells us there, our parents' praise Their children's virtue ought to raise: Their worth and praise shou'd prick us on To labour after like renown. Who but thy father has been able, Since Hercules, to cleanse a stable? About his ears how strange a rattle! Who ever stood so tough a battle? H' has tam'd the most unruly cattle.— Just two such jobbs as yet remain To be dispatch'd by you and B?. Your father with Herculean club The tyrants of our souls did drub; B? for our bodies, you our chattels, Must undertake the self-same battles. The world on you have fix'd their eyes, 'Tis you must quell these tyrannies: So shall some title, now unknown, Bangorian-like your labours crown. Ravish'd, methinks, in thought I see The universal liberty. But after all, I know what's in you: You'll do't, a thousand to one guinea. Time flies—the work and pleasure's great; Begin, before it grows too late. Where the plays stand the statutes lodge; And dance not, 'till you dance a judge; Then, tho' you are not half so taper, My Lord, you'll cut a higher caper. To the Rev. Mr. J. S. 1731. By J. H. SIR, Promises are different cases At various times, in various places. In crowded street of Arlington, Where slaves of hope to levées run, A promise signifies no more, Than in the chamber of a whore. And when the good deceiv'd Sir Francis With madam up from Yorkshire dances, To claim the great man's promise given Some six years since, or (some say) seven; No one can blame that curious writer, That says, they'll both return the lighter. But can we hence affirm that no miss Of all the sex can keep a promise? Or say, from what our courtier speaks, That all men's faiths are wafer-cakes? That courts make rogues is my belief, As 'tis the mill that makes the thief. But 'cause one limb is none o'th' best, Shall I for that cut off the rest? Sure it may be with safety said, A parson's promise duely made Beneath a prelate's holy roof, Must stand 'gainst all assaults a proof. Yet he, who thinks the church unshaken, May find himself in time mistaken. I know the man, and grieve to say't, Who so did fail—and that was S? And can we then no more depend on Our good forgetful friend at Findon, Than on a courtier promiseful, Or a whore's oath to cheat her cull? Can S? no better promise keep? If that were true—I e'en shou'd weep. In Sarum's town when last we met, I told you 'mongst much other prate, That my design was to withdraw, And leave the craggy paths of law: And as the skilful pilot steers Wide of the dreadful rocks he fears, And in the safer ocean rides, Nor fears his vessel's bulging sides; So I from Coke's and Croke's reports, And special pleadings of the courts, Had veer'd about to bury dead, And 'gainst a pulpit run my head. Didst thou not promise then and there, (But promises are china-ware) Didst thou not promise, as I spoke, That you'd ere long your Muse invoke, And cloath'd in strong harmonious line, Send counsel to the young divine? Where of thy word then is the troth, Which I thought good as any oath? Or where that strong harmonious line, Bless'd by each sister of the Nine? That whore we speak of i'th' beginning, Hath some excuse to make for sinning: Her tongue and tail are taught deceit From her not knowing where to eat. The courtier too hath some excuse To think word-breaking small abuse: And 'midst the hurry, noise, and bustle, Of crowds, that at his levée jostle, No man can be in such a taking To see a little promise-breaking. But what indulgence, what excuse Can plead for thee, or for thy Muse? For thee, on whom the sisters wait Pleas'd with the task impos'd by S?; Whom at his christ'ning they did dip O'er head and ears in Aganip; For thee, at mention of whose strain Their winged courser courts the rein, Bounds e'en through Sussex-roads along, Proud of the burthen of thy song? Answer to the foregoing, 1731. By J. S. —My dearest boy, Apollo's and the prelate's joy; Your sharp rebuke came safe to hand, And speedy answer does demand. You charge me home—our conscious Muse Wou'd fain say something in excuse. The promise made must be confess'd, But here, Sir—distinguendum est. A promise broke and one delay'd Differ as much as light and shade. By this distinction all your whores And courtiers I turn out of doors, And, by induction logical Prove, they affect not me at all. But if my logic be not good, I'll prove it from the word of God, Which serves to clear all sorts of cases, And wears a masquerade of faces. When bloody-minded Jephtha swore, If he return'd a conqueror, He'd offer up in sacrifice What from his house first met his eyes; And when his girl and only child Hasten'd to welcome from the field With pious joy her prosp'rous sire, Gaily dancing to the lyre; The holy butcher understood His promise's performance good, Tho' for a year the virgin stray'd, And wept her unlost maidenhead. Thus, Sir, you see we men of letters Can, like Jack Shepherd, cut our fetters; When pinch'd, we file scholastic saw, And iron is no more than straw: The man is thought to have no brains, Who can't break loose, or bind in chains. Your Sykes's and your Waterlands Have nothing else upon their hands: They stand prepar'd with double tackle To fix, or to remove the shackle. But, my dear boy, we'll only tye The silken bands of amity; Or such as hock-tide boys and misses With laughter bind, and harmless kisses; Indulge the free poetic measure, And mimic discord for more pleasure. But after all these long preambles, In which our nag, at best, but ambles: After our plea of mere delay, 'Tis fit we think our debt to pay. Soon then as business will permit, We'll send you up another sheet, Full fraught with our most learn'd advice, In which we must be somewhat nice; We'll rouse our thoughts, and take due time, And trifle not in dogrel rhime; But boldly whip the winged steed, And raise him to a nobler speed. Quod dignum tanto feret hic promissor hiatu? By the Same. [Adam alone cou'd not be easy] Adam alone cou'd not be easy, So he must have a wife, an't please ye: But how did he procure his wife, To cheer his solitary life? Why, from a rib ta'en out his side Was form'd this necessary bride. But how did he the pain beguile? Pho! he slept sweetly all the while. But when this rib was re-applied, In woman's form, to Adam's side, How then, I pray you, did it answer? He never slept so sweet again, Sir. CUPID and CHLOE. By the Same. To deck her bosom Chloe chose, Before all flow'rs, the blushing rose: It made her breasts more lovely shew, And added whiteness to their snow. The tender nymph, herself a bud, So much already understood. But once, bless'd hour! she went to see The produce of the favourite tree. A large and tempting rose she found, Which spread its perfumes all around. It seem'd to court the virgin's hand, The virgin did not long withstand. She pluck'd—but O! a sudden pain Made her release the stalk again. The wound appear'd, her finger bled, And stain'd the rose with guilty red. The nymph, with pain and anger mov'd, Began to hate what once she lov'd; She sigh'd, she wept, and stamp'd, and swore She'd touch the odious tree no more. When forth a little Cupid came, T'appease the crying angry dame. The angry nymph the God perceives Struggling through th'intangling leaves: When from his fragrant ambuscade He thus accosts the weeping maid. Cease, Chloe, cease; and do not cry, Nor blame the harmless tree—'twas I. 'Twas I, that caus'd the little pain, And I—will make it well again. My mother bad me do't; and said, This herb would ease the suff'ring maid. Let it but to the place be bound, 'Twill stop the blood, and heal the wound. But, Chloe, if so small a dart, And in the finger, gives such smart, What, madam—if I'd pierc'd your heart? Cease then to scorn my pow'r; and know, By what I've done, what I can do. Here he assum'd an aweful look; He nodded thrice, his locks he shook, And mimick'd Jove in all he spoke. With strenuous arm he twang'd his bow, He shew'd her all his quiver too; This, says the God,—and this, the dart, That wounded such and such a heart. The virgin saw, admir'd, believ'd, And bow'd—the God with smiles receiv'd The adoration which she pay'd, And wav'd his purple wings, and left the wond'ring maid. My Chloe still can shew the scar, And boasts the God's peculiar care. She loves and is belov'd again, Secure of pleasure, free from pain. I've seen the rose adorn'd with blood, Which from my Chloe's finger flow'd; I've seen the sprig where Cupid stood. I saw his little fragrant nest— And Chloe told me all the rest. The Poet to his false Mistress. By the same. Wonder not, faithless woman, if you see, Yourself so chang'd, so great a change in me. With shame I own it, I was once your slave, Ador'd myself the beauties which I gave; For know, deceiv'd deceitful, that 'twas I Gave thy form grace, and lustre to thine eye: Thy tongue, thy fingers I their magic taught, And spread the net in which myself was caught. So pagan priests first form and dress the wood, Then prostrate fall before the senseless God. But now, curst woman, thy last sentence hear: I call'd thy beauty forth, I bid it disappear. I'll strip thee of thy borrow'd plumes; undress, And shew thee in thy native ugliness. Those eyes have shone by me, by me that chin The seat of wanton Cupids long has been: Ye fires, go out—ye wanton Cupids, fly— Of ev'ry beam disarm her haggard eye: 'Tis I recall ye; my known voice obey— And nought of beauty but the falshood stay. On Mr. ?, Schoolmaster at ?. By the Same. Behold the lordly pedant in his school, How stern his brow, how absolute his rule! The trembling boys start at his aweful nod; Jove's sceptre is less dreaded than his rod. See him at home before the sovereign dame! How fawning, how obsequious, and how tame! Prosper, bright amazon, to thee 'tis given, Like Juno, to rule him who rules the heaven.

The Mouse, an hostile Animal, enur'd To live by rapine, now long time had rov'd Where'er his lust innate of spoil led on; And unaveng'd his wicked craft pursu'd; Long fearless, unaveng'd—All things on earth Felt his fell tooth, while safe in nimble speed Evasive, he in ev'ry dainty dish His revels held secure. Nought was untouch'd, But ev'ry feast wail'd the domestic foe, A constant guest unbidden. Nor strong walls His thefts obstruct, nor massy bars avail, Nor doors robust, to save the luscious cates: Through walls, and bars, and doors he eats his way Contemptuous, and regales with unbought fare. Thus wail'd the helpless world the general foe, But Cambria most; for Cambria's od'rous stores Most stimulate the curious taste of Mouse: Not with a taste content, or lambent kiss, (The fate of common cheese,) he undermines And hollows with reiterated tooth Eatable Palaces. The Nation saw, And rag'd—Revenge and grief distract their minds— What shou'd they do? They foam, they gnash their teeth, And o'er their pendant rocks in fury rove, Restless with rage—for Nature prone to rage The Cambrians form'd, and bade their fiery breasts Burst into sudden flame—that men would deem Their souls were with their fingers sulphur-ting'd. It is decreed—Rage prompts them to revenge Unsated but with blood—Yet by what means, What art the cautious felon to ensnare, They doubt: for, Cambria, thy Grimalkin race Nor to the house defence, nor in distress So imminent, cou'd aught of succour bring. Oft had the Cat plac'd at the cavern's mouth The various ambuscade; as oft with paw Soft-silent creeping, near the hollow cell Kept wary watch—In vain—The little Mouse In little bulk secure, (advantage great Over a Giant Foe!) if chance he spy Her watching at his door intent on prey, Inward he flies, his serpentine recess Pursues, and caves impervious to Cat: Nor dares again thrust out his head in air, Nor form new sallies, till the siege be rais'd, And danger with the watchful foe withdrawn. The Cambrians thus, (if Cambrians with the Mouse We may compare,) when Roman Julius sought To join the Britons to the world subdu'd, Eluded his vain toil.—To their retreat At once a nation vanish'd; in their rocks, Rampires impregnable, lay safe obscur'd 'Mid circling ruin; and of conquest though Despairing, to be conquerable scorn'd. Their long, unbroken lineage hence they boast, Their country unsubdued, and ancient tongue. Thus did the Mouse, by custom tutor'd, oft Evade the hostile paw; nor Cambria's sons Had hope from their confederate of the war: When strait, on th'utmost frontiers of their Land, Where now Menevia the shrunk honours mourns Of her divided mitre, of whose walls Half-buried but an empty name remains, Behold a Council summons'd. From each side See Nobles, Fathers, and the vulgar throng Of stench sulphureous, mix. An ancient Sage, Whose length of beard oft from his native hills The goat with envy ey'd; his hands, his face With scurf of ancient growth encrusted o'er; Broken with years, against a post reclin'd, (By Cambrian backs still shaken) in the midst Stood visible to all, and with deep tone These words precipitating, gutt'ral spake. “Of open war we treat not, but sly theft— “No foreign foe, but a too inmate guest “(That heavier evil) summons us to meet. “Still shall the bold insulter lord it thus, “The tyrant Mouse? Rouse, aweful Fathers, rouse; “Ye, to whose breasts your country's good is dear, “By counsel end these horrors; and if aught “Of hope remain, now lend propitious aid: “So shall your glory grow, your names be known “Immortal as Cadwalader's in fame.” He spake, and strait the fragments, mouldy scraps, Reliques of rapine, monuments of theft, High in their sight uprearing, rous'd their rage. Now thirst of dire revenge, now lust of fame Burns emulous, and fires each Patriot breast; Each meditates to Mouse unheard-of fate, And ev'ry brain is hamm'ring on a Trap. But one 'bove all by th'honour-added name Of Taffy fam'd, far more for wit renown'd: Cambria ne'er bred his peer, whether at forge, Or council; Senator and Blacksmith He. Thus 'gan the Sage—“Should Cheese, our Nation's boast, “In Cambria be extinct, I fear our hinds “Wou'd mourn their whole meals sunk, and Nobles grieve “The honours lost, that crown'd the second course. “Since then nor Cambria's courage, nor her Cats “Against the monsters can prevail, we'll try “If this mechanic hand, if craft, deceit, “Can aught advantage: in a foe none asks “If force prevail, or fraud.” Strait at this boast, All fix on Taffy their expecting eyes, All in glad murmurs speak their promis'd joy, Wait whence the bliss; question, and burn to know. Scratching his head, (as British heads demand,) He ghastly smil'd, and strait with freer air Proceeded thus—“When wearied, at the close “Of yester sun I gave my limbs to rest, “And slumber deep my eyes had quench'd; a Mouse “Bold and pursuing, as I guess, the trail, “Which unconnected Cheese recent exhal'd “From out my viscous jaws, stole down my mouth “Then discontinuous; and reaching now “My very entrails, strait their crude contents “'Gan gnaw, and through my throat ill-fortified “My yester's meal, alas! triumphant drags. “When sudden rous'd from sleep, in his retreat “I 'twixt my teeth the felon snap'd, and bound “Vainly rebellious in the biting chain. “Instructed thus that Mouse might be enthrall'd, “New visionary prison-houses rise “In my revolving mind, and such restraints, “As the late captive of my jaws suggests. “By what mysterious laws the hand of Jove “Moves sublunary things! By what hid rules “The chain of causes acts! the Mouse himself “To us involuntary succour brings, “And for the wounds he gave himself prescribes. “Blush not by such a master to improve; “From foes to learn, honour nor right forbids.” These said, homeward he his. Th'applauding throng Accompany his route, and to his toil Propitious omens beg. Each to his house Bends his swift course; each to his Lares flies, Glad harbinger of this expected birth From Taffy's brain: and whilst they tell the tale, Whilst to the Gods for glad event they bend Of the great enterprize, the Mousing Kind (Prophetic instinct!) shew unwonted joy Gamesome; and (if we credit Fame) beneath The matron's hand dances the embryo cheese. Taffy mean while with head, and hand, and heart, Plies his great work, with Pallas' aid divine The Mouse-Trap builds. A wonderful machine Now stood confess'd; and form 'till then unknown The Tragi-comic edifice indu'd. Now smile, sweet Muse, and to our sight disclose The infant fabric; each particular Dilate, and join them in the finish'd pile. Of oblong form twin planks of wood compose The base and roof; a wiry palisade Fences each side, on whose small columns rais'd The fabric stands: th'insidious gate invites With friendly-seeming welcome; but on high, Depending from a slender thread, the vast Portcullis threats, to thoughtless Mice sure death. (Such is the thread of life, spun by the Fates To Mouse and Man—All on a thread depend.) Amidst the level roof shoots up a mast Erect, in whose cleft head a slender beam Transverse inserted plays, and on each side Extends its poised arms; whose one extreme Depress'd, one equally the pendent door Exalts. Within, let through a slender bore, A wire depends that fluctuates with a touch; The lower part is cramp'd into a hook, Tenacious of the bait; while th'upper gripes Th'extremest handle of the treach'rous beam. But soon as e'er it feels the foe to 've touch'd The fatal food, the loosen'd portal strait Lets fall, and speaks the first attack reveng'd. Things thus dispos'd, instant the pendent hook Taffy with treason cloaths, and turns to death The very food of Mouse: but, that his cheese More fragrant may from far the Foe invite, Toasts the fell bait, and strengthens the perfume. And now appear'd the memorable night, When on his bed Taffy his limbs fatigu'd Reposing, near his pillow's downy side His Minion Mouse-Trap set, and all-secure I'th' faithful centry, slumber sweet indulg'd. The frolic Mice, (a tribe audacious they) Safe in the covert of the silent night, Now sport abroad: when one, a leader Mouse, Of nose sagacious, born the Gods his foes, The hostile ambush seeks, led by the scent Of toasted cheese delicious. The Grate resists His swift career, and entrance first denies— But he, to suffer such severe repulse Indignant, round the wiry fortress scours, And crisps his nose, and with sagacious beard A pass explores; and enter'd now the lines, Impassable again, of all his wish At length possess'd, the deadly bait secures, Feasts on his ruin, and enjoys his fate. Taffy, whom strait the pendulous door, scarce drop'd, With sudden clap had wak'd, you might behold Now on his elbow prop'd, now from his bed Skipping triumphant, fir'd with thirst to know What new-come guest. The Mouse ridiculous Rages within, batters with front and foot, Proves with his head each wiry interval, And wears with raging tooth his iron hold. Driv'n to the toils so raves the Marsian boar Horrid, and shakes his waving bonds, the sport Of circling dogs; he flings about his foam, And on his front erect the bristles stare. The morrow came, and from her rocky highths, Precipitant, whole Cambria pours; for strait In ev'ry ear the novel tale was rise— Nor wonder, for the Ass, his solemn wont Relax'd, nor mindful of his late slow pace, The mountain climbs more wanton than the kid: Thence with sonorous din from rusty throat, (The Cambrian Herald simulating,) thrice Thee, Taffy, bray'd; thrice told the public joy. Nor less the Owl; (from that great Æra term'd Cambria's Embassador:) for through her towns, And utmost limits wand'ring wild that night, She scratch'd the windows with her ominous beak, Grating harsh dissonance, and sung in shrieks The instant fate of Mouse. The lab'ring rocks Bring forth, and Pembroke's, and Mervinia's sons In swarms condens'd rush down; and whom the walls Of Bonium hold, and Maridunum fam'd For their prophetic bard, Merlin; and whom Fruitful Glamorgan feeds, and he that drinks Of Vaga's stream, with the rough hardy clown Montgomery manures.—Then Taffy, 'midst The crowded ring, his raging prey insults. “Vain are thy efforts—fix'd thy doom of death, “On this my altar the first victim thou, “To dye with memorable blood the frame. “No hope remains: thy flight these wiry posts “Inexorable bar—Dread, wicked wight, “The fate thy merits ask; for these thy bonds “Thou quit'st not but with life.” The fatal words Scarce had he spoke, when from the sunny thatch, (Her wonted haunt, when with extended limbs She basks luxurious, winking in soft ease,) Down leap'd the playful Cat.—Her swift approach The captive eyes, and pricks his ears, and stiff Bristles his gibbous back, nor dares attempt The portal now up-drawn; but his sole hope Of freedom only in his prison fix'd, With hooked talons grasps his bonds, and hangs Tenacious by his feet—At length he drops Out-shaken: instant to her prey the Cat Flies rapid, and with rude embrace enfolds, And savage kisses on her struggling foe (Vain efforts!) cruelly imprints. No pause Her rage admits; her sinuous-twirling tail Denotes the Victor's joy; her body moves Agil in wanton frolicks, watching now Prone on the earth intent the destin'd Mouse; His neck now lightly pats with hurtless paw, Dissembling love; but ruminates the while To tear him limb from limb. The Mouser thus, Witty in tyranny, with various art Wanton barbarity enjoys: but now, Tir'd with the sportive mockery, no more Conceals her rage, but o'er her trembling prey Like the starv'd lion hangs, and growling tears His gory entrails, and convulsive limbs. The circling croud, soon as his hated blood Sprinkled they spy, fill with glad shouts the air; And Echo, tenant of the Cambrian hills, Their clam'rous joy repeats; Plinlimmon's highth, And Brechin with the loftier Snowdon join: To th'neighb'ring stars the loud acclaim ascends, And Offa's Ditch rebellows to the din. Taffy, for ever live—Ev'n to this day Thy gift the Cambrian celebrates; and Thee Commemorates each circling year. The land Grateful, its native honours to maintain, Each joyful head crowns redolent with Leek. Verses under the Prints of Mr. Hogarth's Rake's Progress, 1735. By the Same. PLATE I. Scene, The room of the miserly father. O vanity of Age! untoward, Ever spleeny, ever froward! Why those bolts, and massy chains, Squint suspicious, jealous pains? Why, thy toilsome journey o'er, Lay'st thou in an useless store? Hope along with Time is flown, Nor can'st thou reap the field thou'st sown. Hast thou a son?—In time be wise. He views thy toil with other eyes.— Needs must thy kind, paternal care, Lock'd in thy chests, be buried there; Whence then shall flow thy friendly ease, That social converse, homefelt peace, Familiar duty without dread, Instruction from example bred, Which youthful minds with freedom mend, And with the Father mix the Friend? Uncircumscrib'd by prudent rules, Or precepts of expensive schools; Abus'd at home, abroad despis'd, Unbred, unletter'd, unadvis'd; The headstrong course of youth begun, What comfort from this darling son? PLATE II. The rake's levee. Prosperity (with harlot's smiles, Most pleasing when she most beguiles,) How soon, sweet foe, can all thy train Of false, gay, frantic, loud, and vain, Enter the unprovided mind, And memory in fetters bind; Load Faith and Love with golden chain, And sprinkle Lethe o'er the brain! Pleasure, in her silver throne, Smiling comes, nor comes alone; Venus comes with her along, And smooth Lyæus ever young; And in their train, to fill the press, Come apish Dance, and swoll'n Excess, Mechanic Honour, vicious Taste, And Fashion in her changing vest. PLATE III. A brothel. O vanity of youthful blood, So by misuse to poison Good! Woman, fram'd for social love, Fairest gift of pow'rs above; Source of ev'ry houshold blessing, All charms in innocence possessing— But turn'd to Vice all plagues above, Foe to thy being, foe to Love! Guest divine to outward viewing, Abler minister of ruin! And thou no less of gift divine, Sweet Poison of misused Wine! Milton. With freedom led to ev'ry part, And secret chamber of the heart; Dost thou thy friendly host betray, And shew thy riotous gang the way To enter in with covert treason, O'erthrow the drowsy guard of reason, To ransack the abandon'd place, And revel there with wild excess? PLATE IV. St. James's street where the rake is arrested. O vanity of youthful blood, So by misuse to poison Good! Reason awakes, and views unbar'd The sacred gates he watch'd to guard; Approaching sees the harpy, Law, And Poverty, with icy paw Ready to seize the poor remains That Vice hath left of all his gains. Cold Penitence, lame After-thought, With fears, despair, and horrors fraught, Call back his guilty pleasures dead, Whom he hath wrong'd and whom betray'd. PLATE V. Marybone church, where he marries a rich old woman. New to the school of hard Mishap, Driv'n from the ease of Fortune's lap, What shames will Nature not embrace T'avoid less shame of drear distress! Gold can the charms of youth bestow, And mask deformity with shew: Gold can avert the sting of Shame, In Winter's arms create a flame; Can couple youth with hoary age, And make antipathies engage. PLATE VI. A gaming house. Gold, thou bright son of Phœbus, source Of universal intercourse; Of weeping Virtue soft redress, And blessing those who live to bless! Yet oft behold this sacred trust, The tool of avaritious lust: No longer bond of humankind, But bane of ev'ry virtuous mind. What Chaos such misuse attends! Friendship stoops to prey on friends; Health, that gives relish to delight, Is wasted with the wasting night; Doubt and mistrust is thrown on Heaven, And all its power to Chance is given. Sad purchase of repentant tears, Of needless quarrels, endless fears, Of hopes of moments, pangs of years! Sad purchase of a tortur'd mind To an imprison'd body join'd! PLATE VII. A prison. Happy the man, whose constant thought (Though in the school of hardship taught,) Can send Remembrance back, to fetch Treasures from life's earliest stretch; Who, self-approving, can review Scenes of past virtues, which shine through The gloom of age, and cast a ray To gild the evening of his day! Not so the guilty wretch confin'd; No pleasures meet his conscious mind; No blessings brought from early youth, But broken faith, and wrested truth, Talents idle and unus'd, And ev'ry trust of heav'n abus'd. In seas of sad reflection lost, From horrors still to horrors toss'd, Reason the vessel leaves to steer, And gives the helm to mad Despair. PLATE VIII. Bethle'm. Madness! thou Chaos of the brain; What art, that pleasure giv'st and pain? Tyranny of Fancy's reign! Mechanic Fancy! that can build Vast labyrinths and mazes wild, With rule disjointed, shapeless measure, Fill'd with Horror, fill'd with Pleasure! Shapes of Horror, that wou'd even Cast doubt of mercy upon heaven! Shapes of Pleasure, that but seen Wou'd split the shaking sides of Spleen! Of vanity of Age! here see The stamp of heav'n effac'd by thee! The headstrong course of youth thus run, What comfort from this darling son? His rattling chains with terror hear; Behold death grappling with despair; See him by thee to ruin sold, And curse thyself, and curse thy Gold. On the Friendship of two young Ladies, 1730. By the Same. Hail, beauteous pair, whom Friendship binds In softest, yet in strongest ties, Soft as the temper of your minds, Strong as the lustre of your eyes! So Venus' doves in couples fly, And friendly steer their equal course; Whose feathers Cupid's shafts supply, And wing them with resistless force. Thus as you move Love's tender flame, Like that of Friendship, paler burns; Both our divided passion claim, And friends and rivals prove by turns. Then ease yourselves and bless mankind, Friendship so curst no more pursue: In wedlock's rosy bow'r you'll find The joys of Love and Friendship too. CHLOE's unknown Likeness, 1738. By the Same. I In shape, in air, in face and voice The very ape of Chloe! Since I have fix'd for life my choice, 'Tis well I do not know you. II Yet witness, Love, I own the power Of this ideal maid: So much my Chloe I adore, I bow me to her shade. III If idol-worship be a fault, Have mercy, Love, on me— Chloe's the goddess of my thought, Tho' Celia bows my knee. IV Tho' the mock-sun amuse the sight, And more demand the view; We wonder at the mimic light, But only feel the true. V Forgive me, fair reflected shade, That I suppress this flame: Who can pursue th'ideal maid, Bless'd in the real dame? VI Consult your mind, consult your glass, Each charm of sense and youth; Then own, who changes is an ass, Nor wonder at my truth. The BIRD of Passage, 1749. By the Same. I Grown sick of crowds and noise, To peaceful rural joys Good Bellmont from the town retires, Miss Harriet seeks the shade, And looks the country maid, And artfully his taste admires. II Their sympathizing themes Of lawns, and shades, and streams, Were all they sung, and all they said. The music sweet he finds Of well-according minds, And loves the perfect rural mind. III His honest pure desires Not fed by vicious fires, Suggest to speak his flame betimes: But, scarce his passion known, This Passage-Bird is flown To warmer air, and brighter climes. IV From shades to crowded rooms, From flow'rs to dead perfumes— The season calls—she must away, 'Tis then alone she lives, When she in riot gives To routs the night, to sleep the day. V He follows her enrag'd, And finds her deep engag'd At crafty Crib and brazen Brag: He hears her betting high, He sees her slur the die— He takes his boots, and mounts his nag. Verses said to be fixed on the Gate of the Louvre at Paris. 1751. English. By the Same. Our fathers' victims the two Henries see, This to religion, that to liberty. Louis, in thee again the tyrants live; Dread, lest our deep despair those scenes revive. Paris nor yet a Ravilliac denies, The church a Clement, nor the court a Guise. CHLOE resolved. A BALLAD, By the Same. Set to Music by Dr. GREEN. 1743. I As Chloe on flowers reclin'd o'er the stream, She sigh'd to the breeze, and made Colin her theme; Tho' pleasant the stream, and tho' cooling the breeze, And the flowers tho' fragrant, she panted for ease. II The stream it was fickle, and hasted away, It kiss'd the sweet banks, but no longer cou'd stay; Tho' beauteous inconstant, and faithless tho' fair, Ah! Colin, look in, and behold thyself there. III The breeze that so sweet on its bosom did play, Now rose to a tempest, and darken'd the day. As sweet as the breeze, and as loud as the wind, Such Colin when angry, and Colin when kind. IV The flowers when gather'd, so beauteous and sweet, Now fade on her bosom, and die at her feet; So fair in their bloom, and so foul in decay, Such Colin when present, and Colin away. V In rage and despair from the ground she arose, And from her the flowers so faded she throws; She weeps in the stream, and she sighs to the wind, And resolves to drive Colin quite out of her mind. VI But what her resolves when her Colin appear'd? The stream it stood still, and no tempest was hear'd; The flowers recover'd their beautiful hue: She found he was kind, and believ'd he was true. EPILOGUE to Shakespear's first Part of King Henry IV. ACTED BY Young GENTLEMEN at Mr. Newcome's School at Hackney, 1748; Spoken by Mr. J. Y. in the Character of Falstaff, Push'd in upon the Stage by Prince Henry. By the Same. A Plague upon all cowards still I say— Old Jack must bear the heat of all the day, And be the master-fool beyond the play— Amidst hot-blooded Hotspur's rebel strife, By miracle of wit I sav'd my life, And now stand foolishly expos'd again To th'hissing bullets of the critic's brain. Go to, old lad, 'tis time that thou wert wiser— Thou art not fram'd for an epiloguizer. There's Hal now, or his nimble shadow Poins, Strait in the back, and lissome in the loins, Who wears his boot smooth as his mistress' skin, And shining as the glass she dresses in; Can bow and cringe, fawn, flatter, cog and lye— Which honest Jack cou'd never do—not I. Hal's heir-apparent face might stand it buff, And make (ha! ha! ha!) a saucy epilogue enough; But I am old, and stiff—nay, bashful grown, For Shakespear's humour is not now my own. I feel myself a counterfeiting ass; And if for sterling wit I give you brass, It is his royal image makes it pass. Fancy now works; and here I stand and stew In mine own greasy fears, which set to view Eleven buckram critics in each man of you. Wights, who with no out-faceings will be shamm'd, Nor into risibility be bamm'd; Will, tho' she shake their sides, think nature treason, And see one damn'd, ere—laugh without a reason. Then how shall one not of the virtuous speed, Who merely has a wicked wit to plead— Wit without measure, humour without rule, Unfetter'd laugh, and lawless ridicule? 'Faith! try him by his peers, a jury chosen— The kingdom will, I think, scarce raise the dozen. So—be but kind, and countenance the cheat, I'll in, and swear to Hal—I've done the feat. PROLOGUE to COMUS, Perform'd for the Benefit of the General Hospital at Bath, 1756. By the Same. Spoken by Miss Morrison, in the Character of a Lady of Fashion. She enters with a Number of Tickets in her Hand. Well, I've been beating up for volunteers, But find that—charity has got no ears. I first attack'd a colonel of the guards— Sir, charity—consider its rewards. With healing hand the saddest sores it skins, And covers—oh!—a multitude of sins. He swore, the world was welcome to his thoughts: 'Twas damn'd hypocrisy to hide one's faults; And with that sin his conscience ne'er was twitted— The only one he never had committed. Next, to my knight I plead. He—shook his head; Complain'd the stocks were low—and trade was dead. In these Bath-charities a tax he'd found More heavy than—four shillings in the pound. What with the play-house, hospital, and abbey, A man was strip'd—unless he'd look quite shabby. Then such a train, and such expence to fit! My lady, all the brats, and cousin Kit— He'd steal, himself—perhaps—into the pit. Old lady Slipslop, at her morning cards, Vows that all works of genus she regards; Raffles for Chinese Gods, card-houses, shells, Nor grudges to the music, or the bells, But has a strange antiquity to nasty ospitels. I hope your lordship—then my lord replies— No doubt, the governors are—very wise; But, for the play, he—wonder'd at their choice. In Milton's days such stuff might be the taste, But faith! he thought it was damn'd dull and chaste. Then swears, he to the charity is hearty, But can't, in honour, break his evening party. When to the gouty alderman I sued, The nasty fellow, ('gad!) was downright rude. Is begging grown the fashion, with a pox! The mayor should set such housewives in the stocks. Give you a guinea! z?ds! replied the beast, 'Twou'd buy a ticket for a turtle-feast. Think what a guinea-a-head might set before ye— Sir—mullet—turbot—and a grand John Dorey. I'll never give a groat, as I'm a sinner, Unless they gather 't in a dish, at dinner. I trust, by art and more polite address, You fairer advocates met more success; And not a man compassion's cause withstood, When beauty pleaded for such general good. EPIGRAMS from MARTIAL. By the Same. To JAMES HARRIS, Esq; Martial, Book IV. Ep. 87. Wou'dst thou, by Attic taste approv'd, By all be read, by all be lov'd, To learned Harris' curious eye, By me advis'd, dear Muse, apply: In him the perfect judge you'll find, In him the candid friend, and kind. If he repeats, if he approves, If he the laughing muscles moves, Thou nor the critic's sneer shal'st mind, Nor be to pies or trunks consign'd. If he condemns, away you fly, And mount in paper kites the sky, Or dead 'mongst Grub-street's records lye. Book I. Ep. 11. Curmudgeon the rich widow courts, Nor lovely she, nor made for sports; 'Tis to Curmudgeon charm enough, That she has got a church-yard cough. Book I. Ep. 14. When Arria from her wounded side To Pætus gave the reeking steel, I feel not what I've done, she cried; What Pætus is to do—I feel. Book III. Ep. 43. Before a swan, behind a crow, Such self-deceit ne'er did I know. Ah! cease your arts—death knows you're grey, And spite of all, will keep his day. Book IV. Ep. 78. With lace bedizen'd comes the man, And I must dine with lady Anne. A silver service loads the board, Of eatables a slender hoard. “Your pride, and not your victuals spare; “I came to dine, and not to stare. Book VII. Ep. 75. When dukes in town ask thee to dine, To rule their roast, and smack their wine; Or take thee to their country-seat, To make their dogs, and bless their meat; —, dream not on preferment soon, Thou'rt not their friend, but their buffoon. Book VIII. Ep. 35. Alike in temper and in life, A drunken husband, sottish wife, She a scold, a bully he,— The devil's in't, they don't agree. Book XII. Ep. 23. Your teeth from Hemmet, and your hair from Bolney, Was not an eye too to be had for money? Book XII. Ep. 30. Ned is a sober fellow, they pretend— Such wou'd I have my coachman, not my friend. Book XII. Ep 103. You sell your wife's rich jewels, lace, and cloaths; The price once pay'd, away the purchase goes: But she a better bargain proves, I'm told; Still sold returns, and still is to be sold. Book I. Ep. 40. Is there, t'enroll amongst the friendly few, Whose names pure faith and ancient fame renew? Is there, enrich'd with Virtue's honest store, Deep vers'd in Latian and Athenian lore? Is there, who right maintains and truth pursues, Nor knows a wish that heaven can refuse? Is there, who can on his great self depend? Now let me die, but Harris is this friend. A very gallant Copy of Verses, (but somewhat silly) upon the Ladies, and their fine Cloaths at a Ball. By Mr. W. TAYLOR. Happy the worms, that spun their lives away, T'enrich the splendour of this glorious day! Well pleas'd these gen'rous foreigners expire, A sacrifice to Beauty's general fire. Oh! had they seen, with what superior grace Beauty here triumphs in each lovely face, Their am'rous flames had their own work betray'd, And burn'd the web their curious art had made! Another on the same Subject, written with more Judgment, but fewer good Manners. By the Same. How strangely doth the pow'r of custom rule, And prejudice our wisest thoughts controul! How does one country with contempt deride What other nations count their chiefest pride! Our European ladies think they're fine, When in the entrails of a worm they shine; Yet laugh to see conceited Hottentots Grow vain, tho' shining in far nobler guts. In turgid pomp their strutting limbs are deck'd, And unctuous splendours from their robes reflect: The balmy gloss, which on the surface shines, Regales the smell, and smooths the ladies' skins. Richly, yet wisely dress'd! for of the cost They suffer not a remnant to be lost; But eat each tatter, as it wears away, And sup upon the fragments of the day. Frugal of time, at once they' undress and feed, Gnaw off their cloaths, and put themselves to bed. Their wedding garments prove their wedding feasts, And the bride's fin'ry entertains the guests: The eager bridegroom surfeits on her charms, And fills his belly, as he fills his arms. Justly may they condemn our foolish pride, Who only for the naked back provide; And useless garments to the dunghill cast, Before they've through the hungry stomach pass'd; Who well might purchase, had we their good sense, Both food and raiment at the same expence. When will our wives and daughters be so good, Thus to convert their old cloaths into food? The Brewer's Coachman. By the Same. Honest William, an easy and good-natur'd fellow, Wou'd a little too oft get a little too mellow. Body coachman was he to an eminent brewer— No better e'er sat in a box, to be sure. His coach was kept clean, and no mothers or nurses Took that care of their babes that he took of his horses. He had these—ay and fifty good qualities more, But the business of tipling cou'd ne'er be got o'er: So his master effectually mended the matter, By hiring a man, who drank nothing but water. Now, William, says he, you see the plain case; Had you drunk as he does, you'd kept a good place. Drink water! quoth William—had all men done so, You'd never have wanted a coachman, I trow. They're soakers, like me whom you load with reproaches, That enable you brewers to ride in your coaches. FEMALE CAUTION. By the Same. Mother Breedwell presented her husband each year With a chopping brave boy, and sometimes with apair; 'Till the primitive blessing of multiplication Had fill'd the whole house with a young generation. But as that increased, so sorrow and care, Those primitive curses, put in for a share; And the toilsome employments of mother and wife, Had hag'd the poor woman half out of her life. To the doctor she goes with a pitiful face, And begs he wou'd give his advice in her case. She tells him her husband was wretchedly poor, And prays he'd consider her chargeable store, And prevent for the future her having of more. As for that, quoth the sage, I've a cure never failing, Which neither Hippocrates thought of, nor Galen. Look here—I present you this wonderful hose, Into which, ev'ry night when you bed with your spouse, Thrust both legs; nor pull off the magical fetters, Till you rise in the morn about family matters. Observe but this rule, which I give you in charge, And your stock may diminish, but never enlarge. Many thanks for your kindness, dear Sir, quoth the dame, (Here she drop'd him a curt'sie)—if it were not for shame, And for fear you shou'd think me too bold, I'd fain beg T'other shocking—and so have a hose to each leg: For if such rare virtue's contained in one, How safe shou'd I be, had I both of them on! GRACE and NATURE. By the Same. Quoth John to his teacher, Good Sir, if you please, I wou'd beg your advice in a difficult case; 'Tis a weighty concern, that may hold one for life— 'Tis, in short, the old story of taking a wife. There's a pair of young damsels I'm proffer'd to marry, And whether to choose puts me in a quandary: They're alike in age, family, fortune, and feature, Only one has more grace, and the other good-nature. As for that, says the teacher, good-nature and love, And sweetness of temper are gifts from above, And as coming from thence we shou'd give 'em their due; Grace is a superior blessing, 'tis true. Ay, Sir, I remember an excellent sarment, Wherein all along you gave grace the preferment. I shall never forget it, as how you were telling, That heaven resided where grace had its dwelling. Why John, quoth the teacher, that's true: but, alas, What heaven can do is quite out of the case; For by day and by night, with the woman you wed 'Tis you that must board, and 'tis you that must bed; And a good-natur'd girl may quickly grow gracious, But a sour-headed saint will be ever vexatious. HULL ALE. By the Same. Long time did a silly old proverb prevail, That meat, drink, and cloth were all found in good ale; 'Till a lover of truth went on purpose to Hull, And to try the experiment drank his skin full. He began to see visions, his head it turn'd round, 'Till off from his keffal he fell on the ground: There in trances profound our philosopher mellow Lay all night in the snow consulting his pillow. Oracular vapours give prophecy birth, As Plutarch reports, springing out of the earth. Whether this was the cause, or however inspir'd, Our sage gave a sentence will be ever admir'd. 'Twas this—I pronounce that good ale is good meat, For I find, I have no inclination to eat: That good ale is good cloth, you may honestly boast, For i' faith! I'm as blithe and as warm as a toast. But to call it good drink—is a lye, I'll be sworn, For I ne'er was so dry since the hour I was born. The cloth, cries a punster who chanc'd to come by, Must be a good drap, if it kept you so dry. ABSOLUTION. By the Same. It blew an hard storm, and in utmost confusion The sailors all hurried to get absolution; Which done, and the weight of the sins they'd confess'd, Was transfer'd, as they thought, from themselves to the priest; To lighten the ship, and conclude their devotion, They toss'd the poor parson souse into the ocean. PENANCE. A drunken old Scot by the rigorous sentence Of the kirk was condemn'd to the stool of repentance. Mess John to his conscience his vices put home, And his danger in this, and the world that's to come. Thou reprobate mortal; why, dost not thou know Whither, after your death, all you drunkards must go? Must go when we're dead? why Sir, you may swear, We shall go, one and all, where we find the best beer. The MISTAKE. By the Same. A cannon ball, one bloody day, Took a poor sailor's leg away; And, as on 'his comrade's back he made off, A second fairly took his head off. The fellow, on this odd emergence, Carries him pick-back to the surgeons. Z?ds! cries the Doctor, are you drunk, To bring me here an headless trunk? A lying dog! cries Jack,—he said His leg was off, and not his head. A Fragment of CHAUCER. By J. H. Esq; Right wele of lerned clerkis is it sed, That womenhud for mannis' use is made; But naughty man liketh not one, or so, He lusteth aye unthirstily for mo; And whom he whilome cherished, when tied By holy church he cannot her abide. Like unto dog which lighteth of a bone, His tail he waggeth, glad therefore y-grown, But thilke same bone if to his tail thou tye, Pardie, he fearing it away doth fly. Upon an Alcove, now at Parson's Green. O favorite Muse of Shenstone hear! And leave awhile his blissful groves; Aid me this sweet alcove to sing, The Author's seat whom Shenstone loves. Here the soul-harr'wing genius form'd His Pamela's enchanting story! And here divine Clarissa died A martyr to our sex's glory! 'Twas here the noble-minded Howe With ev'ry gen'rous passion glow'd: And here the gentle Belford's eyes With manly sorrows overflow'd. Here Clementina, hapless maid! With wild distress each bosom tears: And here the lovely Harriet own'd A virgin's hopes, a virgin's fears. Here Emily, sweet artless girl, Fills ev'ry breast with strange delight! And when we fear her early fall, Secures her conquest by her flight. Here sprightly Charlotte's hum'rous wit Dispenses mirth to all around: But, ah! we tremble, whilst we smile, Lest its fine edge herself should wound. Here Grandison, to crown the whole, A bright exemplar stands confest! Who stole those virtues we admire From the great Author's glowing breast. O sacred seat! be thou rever'd By such as own thy master's pow'r; And, like his works, for ages last, Till fame and language are no more. The COUNTRY PARSON. I Between the smooth descent of yonder hills, Deep in the vale with tufted trees beset; Whose antique roots are wash'd with brawling rills, Whose leafy arms the summer's rage defeat, There stands a country parson's calm retreat. View well the silent shade with sober eye, And wonder at the courtier's swollen luxury. II See to his garden's pale where close ally'd A decent church the neighbouring glebe commands; Whose steeple's stock'd with bells, (the country's pride) Whose beams are wreath'd about with virgin bands, Wove on the bridal day by virgin hands. The surplice clean, and chancel newly whited, That with the good man's neatness all must be delighted. III His house stands near, (this church's younger brother) Whose furniture shews housewifely, and neat; A little garden runs from one to t'other, Stately in use, excluding useless state, In which a yew tree stands of ancient date: And near it rosemary climbs up the wall; Or else imperfect were the rites of funeral. IV Him liveth near in gentle neighbourhood An heartsome friend, replete with bounteous love, Whose generous wine long time hath corked stood, (Not to avoid the taste but to improve;) With him the good man's moments softly move: Nor yet compleat, if I shou'd leave untold The dame who of his joys sweet partnership doth hold. V Well knows she when to govern, when obey, Vers'd in the rights and laws of womanhood; Nor hath she too much wisdom to be gay, Nor hath she so much wit to be o'er-loud: Nor hath she so much beauty to be proud; But cheerful sense and decent mirth impart The sweet domestic joys of a well-natur'd heart. VI Eight years hath heav'n possess'd them of a boy, Who loves a sister younger by a year; And as they prank about, with silent joy They sit and smile upon the prattling pair, (Who two sweet roses on one stalk appear) And think upon themselves once fair and young, Before soft Cupid's golden bow became unstrung. VII Each sun arises fresh with sweet content, And leads them on a course of new delight; With the same joy the summer's day is spent, And o'er a cheerful fire their winter night. Such are their joys who spend their lives aright: Tho' seasons change, no sense of change they know, But with an equal eye view all things here below. VIII When th'amorous earth is woo'd with smiling weather, To wear the verdant mantle of the spring; Forth walk the little family together To see the wood, and hear its natives sing; The flow'rs sweet odours to their senses bring: The world appears in blossom, far and near Joyful they view the purple promise of the year. IX Summer beholds the good man near his bride, In sweet contentment smoaking in his chair; He views the flocks nibbling the mountain's side, And ev'ry tenth he reckons to his share. Now to the hay field walk the happy pair, And with such kindness greet the country folk, The parson's bush is plac'd upon the biggest cock. X The promis'd fruit now fills the teeming soil, And certain plenty all his doubts relieves; The peach he planted pays his honest toil, The farmer brings him home his yellow sheaves, And his stuff'd barn the willing tax receives. His servants to his loaded orchards hye, To lay in liquid stores for future jollity. XI When icy bands the stiffened wave enfold, Still is the parson with contentment crown'd; The cheerful blaze chaces the chilly cold, In circling cups all winter thoughts are drown'd, And no ill nature sends the laugh around; Or he, in study pent, thinks what to say, May touch, yet not offend the squire next sabbath day. XII Thus, still in age the same, he journeys on, Till envious Fate o'ertake him on the road; For the calm pleasures of the holy man Claim not the madness of a youthful blood. For many winters thus serenely stood, Strong in its smooth decline, the sturdy oak, Till came from heav'n th'unfear'd and unresisted stroke. PLAIN TRUTH. By HENRY FIELDING, Esq; As Bathian Venus t'other day Invited all the Gods to tea, Her maids of honour, the miss Graces, Attending duely in their places, Their godships gave a loose to mirth, As we at Butt'ring's here on earth. Minerva in her usual way Rallied the daughter of the sea. Madam, said she, your lov'd resort, The city where you hold your court, Is lately fallen from its duty, And triumphs more in wit than beauty; For here, she cried; see here a poem— 'Tis Dalston's; yon, Apollo, know him. Little persuasion sure invites Pallas to read what Dalston writes: Nay, I have heard that in Parnassus For truth a current whisper passes, That Dalston sometimes has been known To publish her works as his own. Minerva read, and every God Approv'd—Jove gave the critic nod: Apollo and the sacred Nine Were charm'd, and smil'd at ev'ry line; And Mars, who little understood, Swore, d?n him, if it was not good. Venus alone sat all the while Silent, nor deign'd a single smile. All were surpriz'd: some thought her stupid: Not so her confident 'squire Cupid; For well the little rogue discern'd At what his mother was concern'd, Yet not a word the urchin said, But hid in Hebe's lap his head. At length the rising choler broke From Venus' lips,—and thus she spoke. That poetry so cram'd with wit, Minerva, shou'd your palate hit, I wonder not, nor that some prudes (For such there are above the clouds) Shou'd wish the prize of beauty torn From her they view with envious scorn. Me poets never please, but when Justice and truth direct their pen. This Dalston—formerly I've known him; Henceforth for ever I disown him; For Homer's wit shall I despise In him who writes with Homer's eyes. A poem on the fairest fair At Bath, and Betty's name not there! Hath not this poet seen those glances In which my wicked urchin dances? Nor that dear dimple, where he treats Himself with all Arabia's sweets; In whose soft down while he reposes In vain the lillies bloom, or roses, To tempt him from a sweeter bed Of fairer white or livelier red? Hath he not seen, when some kind gale Has blown aside the cambric veil, That seat of paradise, where Jove Might pamper his almighty love? Our milky way less fair does shew: There summer's seen 'twixt hills of snow. From her lov'd voice whene'er she speaks, What softness in each accent breaks! And when her dimpled smiles arise, What sweetness sparkles in her eyes! Can I then bear, enrag'd she said, Slights offer'd to my fav'rite maid, The nymph whom I decreed to be The representative of me? The Goddess ceas'd—the Gods all bow'd, Nor one the wicked bard avow'd, Who, while in beauty's praise he writ, Dar'd Beauty's Goddess to omit: For now their godships recollected, 'Twas Venus' self he had neglected, Who in her visits to this place Had still worn Betty Dalston's face. Ode to Venus, from her Votaries of the Street. By ? Are these thy palms? oh queen of love! Pity thy wretched votaries! From above Behold them stroll, their bosoms bare, Chill'd with the blasts of rude St. Clement's air; And twitch the sleeve with sly advance: Roll the bright eye, or shoot the side-long glance: Whilst the chaste moon, with envious light Peeps thro' the curtain of the freezing night. Not thus when Horace hymn'd thy praise. You heard the Glyceras of happier days. Oh goddess of love's pleasing pain! From thy own isle avert the frost, and rain; Nor let the little mouth inhale, (Bane to the teeth) a rough, unfriendly gale; Or slender ancle white, and neat, Betray a splash from the polluted street. Look down with pity on the woes, That trace our footsteps, and our haunts enclose. For thee, we forfeit fair renown, Brave want and danger, orphans of the town; For thee, sustain the cruel shock Of caustic Franks, and cicatrizing Rock: Happy! if Hermes' timely care, The searching deity of here and there, Can soften the venereal doom, And keep awhile pale beauty from the tomb. But languid! lifeless! cold, and bare, Gone ev'ry tooth, and fallen ev'ry hair, A prey to grief, remorse, disease,— Ah! Paphian Venus, faithless as the seas! Fir'd by thy spells, and magic charms, We guiltless virgins glow'd at soft alarms. Embark'd with youth, and airy smiles, The graces, playful loves and wanton wiles; On pleasure's wave we loos'd the sails, Alas! too credulous of flatt'ring gales; For lo! the heav'ns with clouds are spread, The graces, loves, with youth are fled, And leave the ship, an easy prize, Unrigg'd and leaky to th'inclement skies. An EPIGRAM. By the Same. [I dropt a thing in verse, without a name] I dropt a thing in verse, without a name; I felt no censure, and I gain'd no fame: The public saw the bastard in the cradle, But ne'er enquir'd; so left it to the beadle. A certain nobleman takes up the child, The real father lay perdue, and smil'd. The public now enlarges every grace, What shining eyes it has! how fair a face! Of parts what symmetry! what strength divine! The noble brat is sure of Pelops' line. The POET's IMPORTANCE. By Dr. H? The glow-worm scribblers of a feeble age, Pale twinklers of an hour provoke my rage: In each dark hedge we start an insect fire, Which lives by night, and must at dawn expire; Yet such their number that their specks combine, And the unthinking vulgar swear they shine. Poets are prodigies so greatly rare, They seem the tasks of heav'n, and built with care: Like suns, unquench'd, unrival'd and sublime, They roll, immortal, o'er the wastes of time: Ages in vain close round and snatch in fame; High over all still shines the Poet's name! Lords of a life that scorns the bounds of breath, They stretch existence and defy stern death. Glory and shame are theirs—they plant renown, Or shade the Monarch's by the Muse's crown: To say Augustus reign'd when Virgil shin'd, Does honour to the lord of half mankind. So when three thousand years have wan'd away, And Pope is said t'have liv'd when George bore sway, Millions shall lend the King the Poet's fame, And bless implicit the supported name. To Polly Laurence, quitting the Pump. BATH, January 1756. Spite of beauty, air, and grace, With honour hast thou run thy race! In sunshine well thy part thou'st play'd— Now, sweet Polly, seek the shade. The prudent general, tho' beat, Reaps honour from a good retreat; But nobler thou, thy thousands kill'd, With flying colours leav'st the field. Let not retirement give the spleen, Thy sex's longing—to be seen: But teach the vicious and the vain, Their pleasure's but refining pain. Teach the gay by thy retreat, Eternal giggle is not wit; And the formal fool advise, Prudery cannot make her wise. Take with thee to thy private state Th'applauses of the good and great; The best reward below allow'd Of a conduct great and good. ODE, to a LADY in LONDON. By Miss C? While soft through water, earth, and air The vernal spirits rove, From noise, my dear, and giddy crowds To rural scenes remove. The mountain snows are all dissolv'd, And hush'd the blust'ring gale, While fragrant Zephyrs gently breathe Along the flowery vale. The circling planets' constant rounds The wintry wastes repair, And still from temporary death Renew the verdant year. But ah! when once our transient bloom, The spring of life, is o'er, That rosy season takes its flight, And must return no more. Yet judge by Reason's sober rules, From false Opinion free, And mark how little pilfering years Can steal from you or me. Each moral pleasure of the heart, Each smiling charm of truth, Depends not on the giddy bud Of wild fantastic youth. The vain coquet, whose empty pride A fading face supplies, May justly dread the wintry gloom Where all its glory dies. Leave such a ruin to deplore To fleeting forms confin'd; Nor age, nor wrinkles, discompose One feature of the mind. Amidst the universal change, Unconscious of decay, It views unmov'd the scythe of Time Sweep all besides away. Fix'd on its own eternal frame Eternal are its joys, While borne on transitory wings Each mortal pleasure flies. While every short-liv'd flower of sense Destructive years consume, Through friendship's fair enchanting walks Unfading myrtles bloom. Nor with the narrow bounds of time Its beauteous prospect ends, But lengthen'd through the vale of death To paradise extends. ODE to SPRING. By Miss F. I Hail, genial goddess, blooming Spring! Thy blest return, O let me sing, And aid my languid lays: Let me not sink in sloth supine, While all creation at thy shrine Its annual tribute pays. II Escap'd from Winter's freezing power Each blossom greets thee, and each flower; And, foremost of the train, By Nature, (artless handmaid!) drest, The snow-drop comes in lilly'd vest, Prophetic of thy reign. III The lark now strains his warbling throat, While every loud and sprightly note Calls Echo from her cell. Be warn'd, ye fair, that listen round, A beauteous maid became a sound, A maid who lov'd too well. IV The bright-hair'd sun with warmth benign Bids tree, and shrub, and swelling vine Their infant-buds display: Again the streams refresh the plains, Which Winter bound in icy chains, And sparkling bless his ray. V Life-giving Zephyrs breathe around, And instant glows th'enamel'd ground With Nature's vary'd hues: Not so returns our youth decay'd, Alas! nor air, nor sun, nor shade The spring of life renews. VI The sun's too quick-revolving beam Will soon dissolve the human dream, And bring th'appointed hour: Too late we catch his parting ray, And mourn the idly-wasted day No longer in our power. VII Then happiest he, whose lengthen'd sight Pursues, by virtue's constant light, A hope beyond the skies; Where frowning Winter ne'er shall come, But rosy Spring for ever bloom, And suns eternal rise. ODE to CYNTHIA. By the Same. Sister of Phœbus, gentle Queen, Of aspect mild and brow serene, Whose friendly beams by night appear, The lonely traveller to cheer; Attractive Power; whose mighty sway The ocean's swelling waves obey, And, mounting upward, seem to raise A liquid altar to thy praise: Thee wither'd hags, at midnight hour, Invoke to their infernal bower; But I to no such horrid rite, Sweet Queen, implore thy sacred light, Nor seek, while all but lovers sleep, To rob the miser's treasur'd heap: Thy kindly beams alone impart To find the youth who stole my heart, And guide me, from thy silver throne, To steal his heart, or find my own. ODE to a THRUSH. By Miss P? Sweet warbler! to whose artless song Soft Music's native powers belong, Here fix thy haunt; and o'er these plains Still pour thy wild untutor'd strains, Still hail the morn with sprightly lay, And sweetly hymn the parting day: But sprightlier still, and sweeter pour Thy song o'er Flavia's favorite bower; There softly breathe the vary'd sound, And chant thy loves, or woes around. So may'st thou live securely blest, And no rude storms disturb thy nest; No bird-lime twig, or gin annoy, Or cruel gun thy brood destroy; No want of shelter may'st thou know, Which Ripton's lofty shades bestow; No dearth of winter berries fear, But haws and hips blush half the year. ELEGY. [Ah me! that restless bliss so soon should flie!] I Ah me! that restless bliss so soon should flie! Still as I think my yielding maid to gain, And flatt'ring hope says all my joys are nigh, Officious jealousy renews my pain. II When cold suspense and torturing despair, When pausing doubt, and anxious fear's no more, Some idle falshood haunts my list'ning ear, And wakes my heart to all it felt before. III One treads the mazes of the puzzled dance, With easy step, and unaffected air, False rapture feigns, or rolls a meaning glance, To catch the open, easy-hearted fair. IV Another boasts a more substantial claim, For him fair Plenty fills her golden horn, A thousand flocks support his haughty flame, A thousand acres crown'd with waving corn. V But I nor tread the mazes of the dance With easy step, and unaffected air, Nor rapture feign, nor roll a meaning glance, To catch the open, easy-hearted fair. VI I boast not Fortune's more substantial claim, For me nor Plenty fills her golden horn, Nor wealthy flocks support my humble flame, Nor smiling acres crown'd with waving corn. VII Say will thy gen'rous heart for these reject A tender passion, and a soul sincere? For tho' with me you've little to expect, Believe me, Sylvia, you have less to fear. VIII Come, let us tread the flow'ry paths of peace, 'Till Fate shall seal th'irrevocable doom; Then soar together to yon realms of bliss, And leave our mingled ashes in the tomb. IX Perhaps some tender sympathetic breast, Who knows with Sorrow's elegance to moan, May search the charnel where our relicks rest, And grave our mem'ry on the faithful stone. X “Tread soft, ye lovers, o'er this hallow'd ground, “Here lies fond Damon by his Sylvia's side; “Their souls in life by mutual love were bound, “Nor death the lasting union could divide.” A POEM to the Memory of Thomas, late Marquiss of Wharton, Lord Privy Seal. Vain are these pomps, thy funeral rites to grace, And blazon forth thy long Patrician race; These banners mark'd with boasted feats of old, And streamers waving with distinguish'd gold. Proud hieroglyphics! where are darkly shown Thy brave forefathers merits, not thy own. Herald forbear! these painted honours give To names that only in thy paint can live. Thy colours fade near this illustrious clay, And all thy gaudy gildings die away. See, The marquiss was inter'd at Winchindon on the 22d of April 1715. The total eclipse of the sun happening whilst his remains were on the road, stopped the procession. heaven displeas'd thy fond attempt upbraids, And claims the province thy bold hand invades; Untimely darkness gathering round the skies, Blackens the morn to grace his obsequies. The sick'ning sun shines dim, and in the sight Of gazing crowds, resigns his waning light; Mark how he labours with relapse of night! How his diminish'd face a crescent seems, Like Cynthia newly silver'd with his beams. But as in full eclipse his light expires, Back to its source our gelid blood retires; Chill'd with surprize, our trembling joints unbrace, And pale confusion sits on every face. The bleating flocks, no more the shepherd's care, Stray from those folds to which they wou'd repair. Home to his young the raven wings his way, And leaves untasted his yet bleeding prey. While tow'ring larks their rival notes prolong, They drop benighted in their morning song. Darkness and horror reign o'er earth and skies, And nature for awhile with Wharton dies. O! speak, refulgent parent of the day! With beamy eye who dost the globe survey; Thou radiant source of wit's diviner fire! Thou truest judge of what thou dost inspire! Say, hast thou seen in any age, or clime, Since thy bright race began to measure time, So great a genius rise? in ev'ry part So form'd by nature, finish'd so by art? Such manly sense, with so much fire of mind? Judgment so strong, to wit so lively join'd? No prepossession sway'd his equal soul, Steady to truth she pointed as her pole: Convinc'd of varying in the least degrees, Her pliant index she reclaim'd with ease. Early thro' custom's and prescription's yoke, Tyrants of weaker souls, his reason broke. Good sense revering from the meanest hand, He durst authority in robes withstand. Determin'd always on maturer thought, Still by new reasons, to new measures brought; Firm, but not stubborn; thoughtful, not involv'd; Swift to perform what slowly he resolv'd. No tempests rag'd within his peaceful breast, Where kindling passion reason soon supprest. 'Midst all events his firmness he maintain'd, Struggled with great, but slighter ills disdain'd. Thus what philosophers could only preach, His inborn virtue did in practice reach. Nature design'd him master of address; None knew it more, nor seem'd to know it less. It work'd like magic on your yielding heart, Sure was the charm, but secret was the art. In human nature most exactly learn'd, The artful man he through his masque discern'd. With chosen baits that every temper take, He knew of knave or fool good use to make. His easy breeding free from form and rules, That stiffen the civility of fools, Of various turn, for all occasions fit, Was squar'd with judgment, and well touch'd with wit. Free of access, from affectation clean, Great without pride, nor when familiar, mean. Obliging always with good-natur'd sense, Nor apt to give nor apt to take offence. Nor fond when kind, nor harsh when most severe, Betwixt extremes he justly knew to steer. In conversation wond'rous was his art To guard his own, and sift another's heart. To mirth and wit he led the cheerful way, Reserv'dly open and discreetly gay; Nor could the softest hour his secret soul betray. Bright as the youngest, as the oldest wise, In both extremes, alike he gave surprize. In body active, yet his sprightly mind Within that body felt herself confin'd.— When thoughts important claim'd no longer place, Then building, planting, and the speedy race, Paintings, and books successive took their round, No blanks of time were in his journal sound. Skill'd in the ends of his existence, he To be unuseful thought was not to be. Polite his taste of arts, but vain was art Where nature had so greatly done her part. Through tiresome mediums we at truth arrive; His easy knowledge seem'd intuitive. No copy'd beauties meanly form'd his mind, By heav'n a great original design'd. The seeds of science in his blood were sown, Born with philosophy, 'twas all his own The poet design'd by this to cover the marquiss's want of literature, for he studied men and the world more than books.. Nor bribes nor threat'nings could his zeal abate To serve his country, and avert her fate. Firm to her laws and liberties he stood, Submitting private views to public good. Who could obsequious with the current swim, Whigs might be call'd, but tories were to him. Persons or parties he no longer knew, When swerving once from honest, just, and true. Oft has he stem'd the rage of impious times, When patriot virtues bore the brand of crimes. To check proud tyrants born, and factions awe, But most devoted to good kings and law. Twice his dear country was on ruin's brink, Resolv'd to save her, or with her to sink, His brave attempts successful twice he saw, Once in wise Brunswick, once in great Nassau. No bolder champion in religion's cause; None fought more battles, nor with more applause. To arms he flew as danger press'd her home, And snatch'd the hopeless prey from France and Rome. But as from conscience pure, religion springs, He freedom press'd in unessential things. Coercive laws, he rightly understood, Might make men hypocrites, but never good. All genuine virtue is by nature free; And will, when forc'd, no longer virtue be. Who justly would his eloquence declare, Himself must Wharton's fertile genius share. Would you conceive it? see how o'er the sands Fair Thames advances where Augusta stands. Gentle he flows, but with resistless force, Not like the rapid Rhone's impetuous course; Tho' deep, so clear are his transparent streams, His bottom rising to his surface seems. Full is his spreading current, but restrain'd. And still within its flow'ry banks contain'd. Alternate wealth his two extremes unfold, Downwards he sends us bread, and upwards gold. Flow, sweetest river! still thy course prolong! Thus deep and clear, thus gentle, full and strong, That distant ages may the image see Of Wharton's flowing eloquence in thee. So shall no torrents soil thy crystal stream, Thou patriot's emblem, and thou poet's theme! Ye nobles who surround the British throne, Reflect its lustre, and improve your own; You who resemble, in rich robes of state, That majesty august on which you wait, Witness how often his decisive sense, His wit, his art, and copious eloquence, Have singly won the question to his side, Made Oxford blush, and St. John drop his pride; Whilst every ear was with his accents charm'd, As every breast was with his ardour warm'd: Faction was touch'd and felt the secret force, Dumb, and convicted, but without remorse, Envy with rage contending in her face, To see his triumph and her just disgrace. Nor less in council did his weight appear, The ablest statesman, as the brightest peer. Thou mighty prince, who from persidious power Didst speed to save us in a timely hour; Whilst beauty join'd with valour form'd thy train, To grace our court, and raise our martial vein; Whose rising beams made drooping Credit thrive, Religion spring, fair Liberty revive: Say, if thy chosen ministers, who sate With thee to guide the great machine of state, A more consummate character could boast, Than that which Britain in her Wharton lost. Oh! had kind heaven (if prayers were not too late) Another lustrum added to his date, How would his head, his heart, his hand conspire, To punish traitors as their crimes require! To crush rebellion, bridle factious rage, And quell the monsters of an impious age! How would his bosom beat with joy to see, Great George! the British legend true in thee! To see thee o'er the vanquish'd dragon ride, And free thy kingdoms from his rage and pride! Whilst peace and plenty spread their golden wings Around the best of men, the best of kings, And every tide shall wast into thy ports Wealth from all lands, and homage from all courts. But sov'reign heav'n, whose ways are ever wise, He died a few months after the accession of George I.Just drew the glorious dawn before his eyes; And for his happier son reserv'd the sight Of Brunswick's power in its meridian light. George shall in him prove honour, courage, truth, And find the father in the pregnant youth. Thus the great leader of the Hebrew bands, Through opening billows and o'er burning sands, From Egypt's yoke, and haughty Pharaoh's chains, To Canaan's fruitful hills, and flow'ry plains, From Pisgah's height the promis'd land descry'd; More was forbid; he saw, rejoic'd, and dy'd. Paraphrase upon a French SONG. By the late William Somervile, Esq; Venge moy d'une ingrate maitresse, Dieu du vin, j'implore bon yvresse. Kind relief in all my pain, Jolly Bacchus! hear my pray'r, Vengeance on th'ingrateful fair! In thy smiling cordial bowl, Drown the sorrows of my soul, All thy deity employ, Gild each gloomy thought with joy, Jolly Bacchus! save, oh save From the deep devouring grave, A poor, despairing, dying swain. Haste away, Haste away, Lash thy tigers do not stay, I'm undone if thou delay. If I view those eyes once more, Still shall love, and still adore, And be more wretched than before. See the glory round her face! See her move! With what a grace! Ye Gods above! Is she not one of your immortal race? Fly, ye winged Cupids, fly, Dart like light'ning thro' the sky: You'd ye in marble temples dwell, The dear one to my arms compel; Bring her in bands of myrtle tied, Bid her forget, and bid her hide All her scorn and all her pride. Wou'd ye that your slave repay A smoaking hecatomb each day, O restore, The beauteous Goddess I adore, O restore, with all her charms, The faithless vagrant to my arms. THE TOMB of Shakespear. A VISION. By JOHN GILBERT COOPER, Esq; What time the jocund rosie-bosom'd Hours Led forth the train of Phoebus and the Spring, And Zephyr mild profusely scatter'd flowers On Earth's green mantle from his musky wing, Thr Morn unbarr'd th'ambrosial gates of light, Westward the raven-pinion'd Darkness flew, The Landscape smil'd in vernal beauty bright, And to their graves the sullen Ghosts withdrew. The nightingale no longer swell'd her throat With love-lorn plainings tremulous and slow, And on the wings of Silence ceas'd to float The gurgling notes of her melodious woe: The God of sleep mysterious visions led In gay procession 'fore the mental eye, And my free'd soul awhile her mansion fled, To try her plumes for immortality. Thro' fields of air, methought, I took my flight, Thro' ev'ry clime, o'er ev'ry region pass'd, No paradise or ruin 'scap'd my sight, Hesperian garden, or Cimmerian waste. On Avon's banks I lit, whose streams appear To wind with eddies fond round Shakespear's tomb, The year's first feath'ry songsters warble near, And vi'lets breathe, and earliest roses bloom. Here Fancy sat, (her dewy fingers cold Decking with flow'rets fresh th'unsullied sod,) And bath'd with tears the sad sepulchral mold, Her fav'rite offspring's long and last abode. Ah! what avails, she cry'd, a Poet's name? Ah! what avails th'immortalizing breath To snatch from dumb Oblivion other's fame? My darling child here lies a prey to Death! Let gentle Otway, white-rob'd Pity's priest, From grief domestic teach the tears to flow, Or Southern captivate th'impassion'd breast With heart-felt sighs and sympathy of woe. For not to these his genius was confin'd, Nature and I each tuneful pow'r had given, Poetic transports of the madding mind, And the wing'd words that waft the soul to heaven: The fiery glance of th'intellectual eye, Piercing all objects of creation's store, Which on this world's extended surface lie; And plastic thought that still created more. O grant, with eager rapture I reply'd, Grant me, great goddess of the changeful eye, To view each Being in poetic pride, To whom thy son gave immortality. Sweet Fancy smil'd, and wav'd her mystic rod, When strait these visions felt her pow'rful arm, And one by one succeeded at her nod, As vassal sprites obey the wizard's charm. First a celestial form Ariel in the Tempest. (of azure hue Whose mantle, bound with brede ætherial, flow'd To each soft breeze its balmy breath that drew) Swift down the sun-beams of the noon-tide rode. Obedient to the necromantic sway Of an old sage to solitude resign'd, With fenny vapors he obscur'd the day, Launch'd the long lightning, and let loose the wind. He whirl'd the tempest thro' the howling air, Rattled the dreadful thunderclap on high, And rais'd a roaring elemental war Betwixt the sea-green waves and azure sky. Then, like heav'n's mild embassador of love To man repentant, bade the tumult cease, Smooth'd the blue bosom of the realms above, And hush'd the rebel elements to peace. Unlike to this in spirit or in mien Another form Caliban in the Tempest. succeeded to my view; A two-legg'd brute which Nature made in spleen, Or from the loathing womb unfinish'd drew. Scarce cou'd he syllable the curse he thought, Prone were his eyes to earth, his mind to evil, A carnal fiend to imperfection wrought, The mongrel offspring of a Witch and Devil. Next bloom'd, upon an ancient forest's bound, The flow'ry margin Fairy-land from the Midsummer night's dream. of a silent stream, O'er-arch'd by oaks with ivy mantled round, And gilt by silver Ctnthia's maiden beam. On the green carpet of th'unbended grass, A dapper train of female fairies play'd, And ey'd their gambols in the watry glass, That smoothly stole along the shad'wy glade. Thro' these the queen Titania pass'd ador'd, Mounted aloft in her imperial car, Journeying to see great Oberon her lord Wage the mock battles of a sportive war. Arm'd cap-a-pee forth march'd the fairy king, A stouter warrior never took the field, His threat'ning lance a hornet's horrid sting, The sharded beetle's scale his sable shield. Around their chief the elfin host appear'd, Each little helmet sparkled like a star, And their sharp spears in pierceless phalanx rear'd, A grove of thistles, glitter'd in the air. The scene then chang'd, from this romantic land, To a bleak waste by bound'ry unconfin'd, Where three smart sisters The witches in Macbeth. of the weïrd band Were mutt'ring curses to the troublous wind. Pale Want had wither'd every furrow'd face, Bow'd was each carcase with the weight of years, And each sunk eye-ball from its hollow case Distill'd cold rheum's involuntary tears. Hors'd on three staves they posted to the bourn Of a drear island, where the pendant brow Of a rough rock, shagg'd horribly with thorn, Frown'd on the boist'rous waves which rag'd below. Deep in a gloomy grot remote from day, Where smiling Comfort never shew'd her face, Where light ne'er enter'd, save one rueful ray Discov'ring all the terrors of the place, They held damn'd myst'ries with infernal state, Whilst ghastly spectres glided slowly by, The scritch-owl scream'd the dying call of fate, And ravens croak'd their baleful augury. No human footstep cheer'd the dread abode, Nor sign of living creature could be seen, Save where the reptile snake, or sullen toad, The murky floor had soil'd with venom green. Sudden I heard the whirlwind's hollow sound, Each weïrd sister vanish'd into smoke. Now a dire yell of spirits Ghosts in Macbeth, Richard III. &amp;c. underground Thro' troubled Earth's wide yawning surface broke; When lo! each injur'd apparition rose; Aghast the murd'rer started from his bed; Guilt's trembling breath his heart's red current froze, And Horror's dew-drops bath'd his frantic head. More had I seen—but now the God of day O'er earth's broad breast his flood of light had spread, When Morpheus call'd his fickle dreams away, And on their wings each bright illusion fled. Yet still the dear Enchantress of the brain My waking eyes with wishful wand'rings sought, Whose magic will controuls th'ideal train, The ever-restless progeny of Thought. Sweet pow'r, I said, for others gild the ray Of Wealth, or Honor's folly-feather'd crown, Or lead the madding multitude astray To grasp at air-blown bubbles of renown. Me (humbler lot!) let blameless bliss engage, Free from the noble mob's ambitious strife, Free from the muck-worm miser's lucrous rage, In calm Contentment's cottag'd vale of life. If frailties there (for who from them is free?) Thro' Error's maze my devious footsteps lead, Let them be frailties of humanity, And my heart plead the pardon of my head. Let not my reason impiously require What heav'n has plac'd beyond its narrow span, But teach it to subdue each fierce desire, Which wars within its own small empire, man. Teach me, what all believe, but few possess, That life's best science is ourselves to know, The first of human blessings is to bless, And happiest he who feels another's woe. Thus cheaply wise, and innocently great, While Time's smooth sand shall regularly pass, Each destin'd atom's quiet course I'll wait, Nor rashly break, nor wish to stop the glass. And when in death my peaceful ashes lie, If e'er some tongue congenial speaks my name, Friendship shall never blush to breathe a sigh, And great ones envy such an honest fame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. VI. HYMN TO THE NAIADS. By Dr. AKENSIDE. MDCCXLVI. ARGUMENT. The Nymphs who preside over springs and rivulets are addressed at day-break in honour of their several functions, and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to the moral world. Their origin is deduced from the first allegorical deities, or powers of nature; according to the doctrine of the old mythological poets, concerning the generation of the Gods and the rise of things. They are then successively considered, as giving motion to the air and exciting summer-breezes; as nourishing and beautifying the vegetable world; as contributing to the fulness of navigable rivers, and consequently to the maintenance of commerce; and by that means, to the maritime part of military power. Next is represented their favourable influence upon health, when assisted by rural exercise: which introduces their connection with the art of physic, and the happy effects of mineral, medicinal springs. Lastly, they are celebrated for the friendship which the Muses bear them, and for the true inspiration which temperance only can receive: in opposition to the enthusiasm of the more licentious poets. O'er yonder eastern hill the twilight throws Her dusky mantle; and the God of day, With bright Astræa seated by his side, Waits yet to leave the ocean. Tarry, Nymphs, Ye Nymphs, ye blue-ey'd progeny of Thames, Who now the mazes of this rugged heath Trace with your fleeting steps; who all night long Repeat, amid the cool and tranquil air, Your lonely murmurs, tarry: and receive My offer'd lay. To pay you homage due, I leave the gates of sleep; nor shall my lyre Too far into the splendid hours of morn Ingage your audience: my observant hand Shall close the strain ere any sultry beam Approach you. To your subterranean haunts Ye then may timely steal; to pace with care The humid sands; to loosen from the soil The bubbling sources; to direct the rills To meet in wider channels; or beneath Some grotto's dripping arch, at height of noon To slumber, shelter'd from the burning heaven. Where shall my song begin, ye Nymphs? or end? Wide is your praise and copious—First of things, First of the lonely powers, ere Time arose, Were Love and Chaos. Love, the sire of Fate; Elder than Chaos. Born of Fate was Time, Who many sons and many comely births Devour'd, relentless father: till the child Of Rhea drove him from the upper sky, And quell'd his deadly might. Then social reign'd The kindred powers, Tethys, and reverend Ops, And spotless Vesta; while supreme of sway Remain'd the cloud-compeller. From the couch Of Tethys sprang the sedgy-crowned race, Who from a thousand urns, o'er every clime, Send tribute to their parent; and from them Are ye, O Naiads: Arethusa fair, And tuneful Aganippe; that sweet name, Bandusia; that soft family which dwelt With Syrian Daphne; and the honour'd tribes Belov'd of Pæon. Listen to my strain, Daughters of Tethys: listen to your praise. You, Nymphs, the winged offspring, which of old Aurora to divine Astræus bore, Owns; and your aid beseecheth. When the might Of Hyperion, from his noontide throne, Unbends their languid pinions, aid from you They ask: Favonius and the mild South-west From you relief implore. Your sallying streams Fresh vigour to their weary wings impart. Again they fly, disporting; from the mead Half-ripen'd and the tender blades of corn, To sweep the noxious mildew; or dispel Contagious steams, which oft the parched earth Breathes on her fainting sons. From noon to eve, Along the river and the paved brook, Ascend the cheerful breezes: hail'd of bards Who, fast by learned Cam, the Mantuan lyre Sollicit; nor unwelcome to the youth Who on the highths of Tybur, all inclin'd O'er rushing Anio, with a pious hand The reverend scene delineates, broken fanes, Or tombs, or pillar'd aqueducts, the pomp Of ancient time; and haply, while he scans The ruins, with a silent tear revolves The fame and fortune of imperious Rome. You too, O Nymphs, and your unenvious aid The rural powers confess; and still prepare For you their grateful treasures. Pan commands, Oft as the Delian king with Sirius holds The central heavens, the father of the grove Commands his Dryads over your abodes To spread their deepest umbrage. well the God Remembereth how indulgent ye supplied Your genial dews to nurse them in their prime. Pales, the pasture's queen, where'er ye stray, Pursues your steps, delighted; and the path With living verdure clothes. Around your haunts The laughing Chloris, with profusest hand, Throws wide her blooms, her odaurs. Still with you Pomona seeks to dwell: and o'er the lawns, And o'er the vale of Richmond, where with Thames Ye love to wander, Amalthea pours Well-pleas'd the wealth of that Ammonian horn, Her dower; unmindful of the fragrant isles Nysæan or Atlantic. Nor can'st thou, (Albeit oft, ungrateful, thou dost mock The beverage of the sober Naiad's urn, O Bromius, O Lenæan) nor can'st thou Disown the powers whose bounty, ill repaid, With nectar feeds thy tendrils. Yet from me, Yet, blameless Nymphs, from my delighted lyre, Accept the rites your bounty well may claim; Nor heed the scoffings of the Edonian band. For better praise awaits you. Thames, your sire, As down the verdant slope your duteous rills Descend, the tribute stately Thames receives, Delighted; and your piety applauds; And bids his copious tide roll on secure, For faithful are his daughters; and with words Auspicious gratulates the bark which, now His banks forsaking, her adventurous wings Yields to the breeze, with Albion's happy gifts Extremest isles to bless. And oft at morn, When Hermes, from Olympus bent o'er earth To bear the words of Jove, on yonder hill Stoops lightly-sailing; oft intent your springs He views: and waving o'er some new-born stream His blest pacific wand, “And yet,” he cries, “Yet,” cries the son of Maia, “though recluse “And silent be your stores, from you, fair Nymphs, “Flows wealth and kind society to men. “By you my function and my honour'd name “Do I possess; while o'er the Bœtic vale, “Or through the towers of Memphis, or the palms “By sacred Ganges water'd, I conduct “The English merchant: with the buxom fleece “Of fertile Ariconium while I clothe “Sarmatian kings; or to the household Gods “Of Syria, from the bleak Cornubian shore, “Dispense the mineral treasure which of old “Sidonian pilots sought, when this fair land “Was yet unconscious of those generous arts “Which wise Phœnicia from their native clime “Transplanted to a more indulgent heaven.” Such are the words of Hermes: such the praise, O Naiads, which from tongues cœlestial waits Your bounteous deeds. From bounty issueth power: And those who, sedulous in prudent works, Relieve the wants of nature, Jove repays With generous wealth and his own seat on earth, Fit judgments to pronounce, and curb the might Of wicked men. Your kind unfailing urns Not vainly to the hospitable arts Of Hermes yield their store. For, O ye Nymphs, Hath he not won the unconquerable queen Of arms to court your friendship? You she owns The fair associates who extend her sway Wide o'er the mighty deep; and grateful things Of you she uttereth, oft as from the shore Of Thames, or Medway's vale, or the green banks Of Vecta, she her thundering navy leads To Calpe's foaming channel, or the rough Cantabrian coast; her auspices divine Imparting to the senate and the prince Of Albion, to dismay barbaric kings, The Iberian, or the Celt. The pride of kings Was ever scorn'd by Pallas: and of old Rejoic'd the virgin, from the brazen prow Of Athens o'er Ægina's gloomy surge, To drive her clouds and storms; o'erwhelming all The Persian's promis'd glory, when the realms Of Indus and the soft Ionian clime, When Lybia's torrid champain and the rocks Of cold Imaüs join'd their servile bands, To sweep the sons of liberty from earth. In vain: Minerva on the brazen prow Of Athens stood, and with the thunder's voice Denounc'd her terrours on their impious heads, And shook her burning Ægis. Xerxes saw: From Heracleum, on the mountain's highth Thron'd in his golden car, he knew the sign Cœlestial; felt unrighteous hope forsake His faltering heart, and turn'd his face with shame. Hail, ye who share the stern Minerva's power; Who arm the hand of liberty for war: And give, in secret, the Britannic name To awe contending monarchs: yet benign, Yet mild of nature: to the works of peace More prone, and lenient of the many ills Which wait on human life. Your gentle aid Hygeia well can witness; she who saves, From poisonous cates and cups of pleasing bane. The wretch devoted to the entangling snares Of Bacchus and of Comus. Him she leads To Cynthia's lonely haunts. To spread the toils, To beat the coverts, with the jovial horn At dawn of day to summon the loud hounds, She calls the lingering sluggard from his dreams: And where his breast may drink the mountain-breeze, And where the fervour of the sunny vale May beat upon his brow, through devious paths Beckons his rapid courser. Nor when ease, Cool ease and welcome slumbers have becalm'd His eager bosom, does the queen of health Her pleasing care withold. His decent board She guards, presiding; and the frugal powers With joy sedate leads in: and while the brown Ennæan dame with Pan presents her stores; While changing still, and comely in the change, Vertumnus and the Hours before him spread The garden's banquet; you to crown his feast, To crown his feast, O Naiads, you the fair Hygeia calls: and from your shelving seats, And groves of poplar, plenteous cups ye bring, To slake his veins: till soon a purer tide Flows down those loaded channels; washeth off The dregs of luxury, the lurking seeds Of crude disease; and through the abodes of life Sends vigour, sends repose. Hail, Naiads: hail, Who give, to labour, health; to stooping age, The joys which youth had squander'd. Oft your urns Will I invoke; and, frequent in your praise, Abash the frantic Thyrsus with my song. For not estrang'd from your benignant arts Is he, the God, to whose mysterious shrine My youth was sacred, and my votive cares Are due; the learned Pæon. Oft when all His cordial treasures he hath search'd in vain; When herbs, and potent trees, and drops of balm Rich with the genial influence of the sun, (To rouze dark fancy from her plaintive dreams, To brace the nerveless arm, with food to win Sick appetite, or hush the unquiet breast Which pines with silent passion) he in vain Hath prov'd; to your deep mansions he descends. Your gates of humid rock, your dim arcades, He entereth; where impurpled veins of ore Gleam on the roof; where through the rigid mine Your trickling rills insinuate. There the God From your indulgent hands the streaming bowl Wafts to his pale-ey'd suppliants; wafts the seeds Metallic and the elemental salts Wash'd from the pregnant glebe. They drink: and soon Flies pain; flies inauspicious care: and soon The social haunt or unfrequented shade Hears Io, Io Pæan; as of old, When Python fell. And, O propitious Nymphs, Oft as for hapless mortals I implore Your salutary springs, thro' every urn O shed selected atoms, and with all Your healing powers inform the recent wave. My lyre shall pay your bounty. Nor disdain That humble tribute. Though a mortal hand Excite the strings to utterance, yet for themes Not unregarded of cœlestial powers, I frame their language; and the Muses deign To guide the pious tenour of my lay. The Muses (sacred by their gifts divine) In early days did to my wondering sense Their secrets oft reveal: oft my rais'd ear In slumber felt their music: oft at noon Or hour of sunset, by some lonely stream, In field or shady grove, they taught me words Of power from death and envy to preserve The good man's name. whence yet with grateful mind, And offerings unprofan'd by ruder eye, My vows I send, my homage, to the seats Of rocky Cirrha, where with you they dwell: Where you their chaste companions they admit Through all the hallow'd scene: where oft intent, And leaning o'er Castalia's mossy verge, They mark the cadence of your confluent urns, How tunefull, yielding gratefullest repose To their consorted measure: till again, With emulation all the sounding choir, And bright Apollo, leader of the song, Their voices through the liquid air exalt, And sweep their lofty strings: those awful strings, That charm the mind of Gods: that fill the courts Of wide Olympus with oblivion sweet Of evils, with immortal rest from cares; Assuage the terrours of the throne of Jove; And quench the formidable thunderbolt Of unrelenting fire. With slacken'd wings, While now the solemn concert breathes around, Incumbent o'er the sceptre of his lord Sleeps the stern eagle; by the number'd notes, Possess'd; and satiate with the melting tone: Sovereign of birds. The furious God of war, His darts forgetting and the rapid wheels That bear him vengeful o'er the embattled plain, Relents, and sooths his own fierce heart to ease, Unwonted ease. The sire of Gods and men, In that great moment of divine delight, Looks down on all that live; and whatsoe'er He loves not, o'er the peopled earth and o'er The interminated ocean, he beholds Curs'd with abhorrence by his doom severe, And troubled at the sound. Ye, Naiads, ye With ravish'd ears the melody attend Worthy of sacred silence. But the slaves Of Bacchus with tempestuous clamours strive To drown the heavenly strains; of highest Jove, Irreverent; and by mad presumption fir'd Their own discordant raptures to advance With hostile emulation. Down they rush From Nysa's vine-impurpled cliff, the dames Of Thrace, the Satyrs, and the unruly Fauns, With old Silenus, through the midnight gloom Tossing the torch impure, and high in air The brandish'd Thyrsus, to the Phrygian pipe's Shrill voice, and to the clashing cymbals, mix'd With shrieks and frantic uproar. May the Gods From every unpolluted ear avert Their orgies! If within the seats of men, Within the seats of men, the walls, the gates Which Pallas rules, if haply there be found Who loves to mingle with the revel-band And hearken to their accents; who aspires From such instructers to inform his breast With verse; let him, fit votarist, implore Their inspiration. He perchance the gifts Of young Lyæus, and the dread exploits, May sing in aptest numbers: he the fate Of sober Pentheus, he the Paphian rites, And naked Mars with Cytheræa chain'd, And strong Alcides in the spinster's robe, May celebrate, applauded. But with you, O Naiads, far from that unhallow'd rout, Must dwell the man whoe'er to praised themes Invokes the immortal Muse. the immortal Muse To your calm habitations, to the cave Corycian or the Delphic mount, will guide His footsteps; and with your unsullied streams His lips will bathe: whether the eternal lore Of Themis, or the majesty of Jove, To mortals he reveal; or teach his lyre The unenvied guerdon of the patriot's toils, In those unfading islands of the blest, Where sacred bards abide. Hail, honour'd Nymphs; Thrice hail. for you the Cyrenaïc shell, Behold, I touch, revering. To my songs Be present ye with favourable feet, And all profaner audience far remove. ODE To the Right Honourable Francis Earl of HUNTINGDON. MDCCXLVII. By the Same. I. 1 The wise and great of every clime, Through all thy spacious walks of Time, Where'er the Muse her power display'd, With joy have listen'd and obey'd. For, taught of heaven, the sacred Nine Persuasive numbers, forms divine, To mortal sense impart: They best the soul with glory fire; They noblest counsels, boldest deeds inspire; And high o'er Fortune's rage inthrone the fixed heart. 2 Nor less prevailing is their charm The vengeful bosom to disarm; To melt the proud with human woe, And prompt unwilling tears to flow. Can wealth a power like this afford? Can Cromwell's arts, or Marlborough's sword, An equal empire claim? No, Hastings. Thou my words wilt own: Thy breast the gifts of every Muse hath known; Nor shall the giver's love disgrace thy noble name. 3 The Muse's awful art, And the fair function of the poet's tongue, Ne'er shalt thou blush to honour; to assert From all that scorned vice or slavish fear hath sung. Nor shall the blandishment of Tuscan strings Warbling at will in pleasure's myrtle bower; Nor shall the baser notes to Celtic kings By lying minstrels paid in evil hour, Move Thee to spurn the heavenly Muse's reign. A different strain, And other themes From her prophetic shades and hallow'd streams (Thou well can'st witness) meet the purged ear: Such, as when Greece to her immortal shell Rejoicing listen'd, godlike sounds to hear; To hear the sweet instructress tell (While men and heroes throng'd around) How life its noblest use may find, How best for freedom be resign'd; And how, by glory, virtue shall be crown'd. II. 1 Such was the Homer. Chian father's strain To many a kind domestic train, Whose pious hearth and genial bowl Had cheer'd the reverend pilgrim's soul: When, every hospitable rite With equal bounty to requite, He struck his magic strings; And pour'd spontaneous numbers forth, And seiz'd their ears with tales of ancient worth, And fill'd their musing hearts with vast heroic things. 2 Now oft, where happy spirits dwell, Where yet he tunes his charming shell, Oft near him, with applauding hands, The genius of his country stands. To listening gods he makes him known, That man divine, by whom were sown The seeds of Græcian fame: Who first the race with freedom fir'd; From whom Lycurgus Sparta's sons inspir'd; From whom Platæan palms and Cyprian trophies came. 3 O noblest, happiest age! When Aristides rul'd, and Cimon fought; When all the generous fruits of Homer's page Exulting Pindar saw to full perfection brought. O Pindar, oft shalt thou be hail'd of me: Not that Apollo fed thee from his shrine; Not that thy lips drank sweetness from the bee; Nor yet that, studious of thy notes divine, Pan danc'd their measure with the sylvan throng; But that thy song Was proud to unfold What thy base rulers trembled to behold; Amid corrupted Thebes was proud to tell The deeds of Athens and the Persian shame: Hence on thy head their impious vengeance fell. But thou, O faithful to thy fame, The Muse's law didst rightly know; That who would animate his lays, And other minds to virtue raise, Must feel his own with all her spirit glow. III. 1 Are there, approv'd of later times, Whose verse adorn'd a Octavius Cæsar. tyrant's crimes? Who saw majestic Rome betray'd, And lent the imperial ruffian aid? Alas! not one polluted bard, No, not the strains that Mincius heard, Or Tibur's hills reply'd, Dare to the Muse's ear aspire; Save that, instructed by the Græcian lyre, With freedom's ancient notes their shameful task they hide. 2 Mark, how the dread Pantheon stands, Amid the domes of modern hands: Amid the toys of idle state, How simply, how severely great! Then turn, and, while each western clime Presents her tuneful sons to Time, So mark thou Milton's name; And add, “Thus differs from the throng “The spirit which inform'd thy aweful song, “Which bade thy potent voice protect thy country's fame.” 3 Yet hence barbaric zeal His memory with unholy rage pursues; While from these arduous cares of public weal She bids each bard begone, and rest him with his Muse. O fool! to think the man, whose ample mind Must grasp at all that yonder stars survey; Must join the noblest form of every kind, The world's most perfect image to display, Can e'er his country's majesty behold, Unmov'd or cold! O fool! to deem That He, whose thought must visit every theme, Whose heart must every strong emotion know By nature planted, or by fortune taught; That He, if haply some presumptuous foe, With false ignoble science fraught, Shall spurn at freedom's faithful band; That He, their dear defence will shun, Or hide their glories from the sun, Or deal their vengeance with a woman's hand! IV. 1 I care not that in Arno's plain, Or on the sportive banks of Seine, From public themes the Muse's quire Content with polish'd ease retire. Where priests the studious head command, Where tyrants bow the warlike hand To vile ambition's aim, Say, what can public themes afford, Save venal honours to an hateful lord, Reserv'd for angry heaven and scorn'd of honest fame? 2 But here, where freedom's equal throne To all her valiant sons is known; Where all are conscious of her cares, And each the power, that rules him, shares; Here let the bard, whose dastard tongue Leaves public arguments unsung, Bid public praise farewell: Let him to fitter climes remove, Far from the heroe's and the patriot's love, And lull mysterious monks to slumber in their cell. 3 O Hastings, not to all Can ruling heav'n the same endowments lend: Yet still doth nature to her offspring call, That to one general weal their different powers they bend, Unenvious. Thus alone, though strains divine Inform the bosom of the Muse's son; Though with new honours the patrician's line Advance from age to age; yet thus alone They win the suffrage of impartial fame. The poet's name He best shall prove, Whose lays the soul with noblest passions move. But thee, O progeny of heroes old, Thee to severer toils thy fate requires: The fate which form'd thee in a chosen mould, The grateful country of thy sires, Thee to sublimer paths demand; Sublimer than thy sires could trace, Or thy own Edward teach his race, Though Gaul's proud genius sank beneath his hand. V. 1 From rich domains and subject farms, They led the rustic youth to arms; And kings their stern atchievements fear'd; While private strife their banners rear'd. But loftier scenes to thee are shown, Where empire's wide-establish'd throne No private master fills: Where, long foretold, The People reigns: Where each a vassal's humble heart disdains; And judgeth what he sees; and, as he judgeth, wills. 2 Here be it thine to calm and guide The swelling democratic tide; To watch the state's uncertain frame, And baffle faction's partial aim: But chiefly, with determin'd zeal, To quell that servile band, who kneel To freedom's banish'd foes; That monster, which is daily found Expert and bold thy country's peace to wound; Yet dreads to handle arms, nor manly counsel knows. 3 'Tis highest heaven's command, That guilty aims should sordid paths pursue; That what ensnares the heart should curb the hand, And virtue's worthless foes be false to glory too. But look on freedom. see, through every age, What labours, perils, griefs, hath she disdain'd! What arms, what regal pride, what priestly rage, Have her dread offspring conquer'd or sustain'd! For Albion well have conquer'd. Let the strains Of happy swains, Which now resound Where Scarsdale's cliffs the swelling pastures bound, Bear witness. there, oft let the farmer hail The sacred orchard which imbowers his gate, And shew to strangers passing down the vale, Where Candish, Booth, and Osborne sate; When bursting from their country's chain, Even in the midst of deadly harms, Of papal snares and lawless arms, They plann'd for freedom this her aweful reign. VI. 1 This reign, these laws, this public care, Which Nassau gave us all to share, Had ne'er adorn'd the English name, Could fear have silenc'd freedom's claim. But fear in vain attempts to bind Those lofty efforts of the mind Which social good inspires; Where men, for this, assault a throne, Each adds the common welfare to his own; And each unconquer'd heart the strength of all acquires. 2 Say, was it thus, when late we view'd Our fields in civil blood imbrued? When fortune crown'd the barbarous host, And half the astonish'd isle was lost? Did one of all that vaunting train, Who dare affront a peaceful reign, Durst one in arms appear? Durst one in counsels pledge his life? Stake his luxurious fortunes in the strife? Or lend his boasted name his vagrant friends to cheer? 3 Yet, Hastings, these are they, Who challenge to themselves thy country's love: The true; the constant: who alone can weigh, What glory should demand, or Liberty approve! But let their works declare them. Thy free powers, The generous powers of thy prevailing mind, Not for the tasks of their confederate hours, Lewd brawls and lurking slander, were design'd. Be thou thy own approver. Honest praise Oft nobly sways Ingenuous youth: But, sought from cowards and the lying mouth, Praise is reproach. Eternal God alone For mortals fixeth that sublime award. He, from the faithful records of his throne, Bids the historian and the bard Dispose of honour and of scorn; Discern the patriot from the slave; And write the good, the wise, the brave, For lessons to the multitude unborn. ODE To the Right Reverend BENJAMIN Lord Bishop of WINCHESTER. By the Same. I. 1 For toils which patriots have endur'd, For treason quell'd and laws secur'd, In every nation Time displays The palm of honourable praise. Envy may rail; and faction fierce May strive: but what, alas, can Those (Though bold, yet blind and sordid foes) To gratitude and love oppose, To faithful story and persuasive verse? 2 O nurse of freedom, Albion, say, Thou tamer of despotic sway, What man, among thy sons arround, Thus heir to glory hast thou found? What page, in all thy annals bright, Hast thou with purer joy survey'd Than that where truth, by Hoadly's aid, Shines through the deep unhallow'd shade Of kingly fraud and sacerdotal night? 3 To him the Teacher bless'd Who sent religion, from the palmy field By Jordan, like the morn to cheer the west, And lifted up the veil which heaven from earth conceal'd, To Hoadly thus He utter'd his behest: “Go thou, and rescue my dishonour'd law “From hands rapacious and from tongues impure: “Let not my peaceful name be made a lure “The snares of savage tyranny to aid: “Let not my words be impious chains to draw “The free-born soul, in more than brutal awe, “To faith without assent, allegiance unrepaid.” II. 1 No cold nor unperforming hand Was arm'd by heaven with this command. The world soon felt it: and, on high, To William's ear with welcome joy Did Locke among the blest unfold The rising hope of Hoadly's name: Godolphin then confirm'd the fame; And Somers, when from earth he came, And valiant Stanhope the fair sequel told. Mr. Locke died in 1704, when Mr. Hoadly was beginning to distinguish himself in the cause of civil and religious liberty: Lord Godolphin in 1712, when the doctrines of the Jacobite faction were chiefly favour'd by those in power: Lord Somers in 1716, amid the practices of the nonjuring clergy against the protestant establishment; and lord Stanhope in 1721, during the controversy with the lower house of convocation. 2 Then drew the lawgivers around, (Sires of the Grecian name renown'd) And listening ask'd, and wondering knew, What private force could thus subdue The vulgar and the great combin'd; Could war with sacred folly wage; Could a whole nation disengage From the dread bonds of many an age, And to new habits mould the public mind. 3 For not a conqueror's sword, Nor the strong powers to civil founders known, Were his: but truth by faithful search explor'd, And social sense, like seed, in genial plenty sown. Wherever it took root, the soul (restor'd To freedom) freedom too for others sought. Not monkish craft the tyrant's claim divine, Not regal zeal the bigot's cruel shrine Could longer guard from reason's warfare sage; Not the wild rabble to sedition wrought, Nor synods by the papal Genius taught, Nor St. John's spirit loose, nor Atterbury's rage. III. 1 But where shall recompence be found? Or how such arduous merit crown'd? For look on life's laborious scene: What rugged spaces lie between Adventurous virtue's early toils And her triumphal throne! The shade Of death, mean time, does oft invade Her progress; nor, to us display'd, Wears the bright heroine her expected spoils. 2 Yet born to conquer is her power: —O Hoadly, if that favourite hour On earth arrive, with thankful awe We own just heaven's indulgent law, And proudly thy success behold; We 'attend thy reverend length of days With benediction and with praise, And hail Thee in our public ways Like some great spirit fam'd in ages old. 3 While thus our vows prolong Thy steps on earth, and when by us resign'd Thou join'st thy seniors, that heroic throng Who rescu'd or preserv'd the rights of human kind, O! not unworthy may thy Albion's tongue Thee still, her friend and benefactor, name: O! never, Hoadly, in thy country's eyes, May impious gold, or pleasure's gaudy prize, Make public virtue, public freedom vile; Nor our own manners tempt us to disclaim That heritage, our noblest wealth and fame, Which Thou hast kept intire from force and factious guile. INSCRIPTIONS. By the Same. I. For a GROTTO. To me, whom in their lays the shepherds call Actæa, daughter of the neighbouring stream, This cave belongs. The fig-tree and the vine, Which o'er the rocky entrance downward shoot, Were plac'd by Glycon. He with cowslips pale, Primrose, and purple Lychnis, deck'd the green Before my threshold, and my shelving walls With honeysuckle cover'd. Here at noon, Lull'd by the murmur of my rising fount, I slumber: here my clustering fruits I tend; Or from the humid flowers, at break of day, Fresh garlands weave, and chace from all my bounds Each thing impure or noxious. Enter-in, O stranger, undismay'd. nor bat nor toad Here lurks: and if thy breast of blameless thoughts Approve thee, not unwelcome shalt thou tread My quiet mansion: chiefly, if thy name Wise Pallas and the immortal Muses own. II. For a Statue of Chaucer at Woodstock. Such was old Chaucer. such the placid mien Of him who first with harmony inform'd The language of our fathers. Here he dwelt For many a cheerful day. these ancient walls Have often heard him, while his legends blithe He sang; of love, or knighthood, or the wiles Of homely life: through each estate and age, The fashions and the follies of the world With cunning hand portraying. Though perchance From Blenheim's towers, O stranger, thou art come Glowing with Churchill's trophies; yet in vain Dost thou applaud them, if thy breast be cold To him, this other heroe; who, in times Dark and untaught, began with charming verse To tame the rudeness of his native land. III. [Whoe'er thou art whose path in summer lies] Whoe'er thou art whose path in summer lies Through yonder village, turn thee where the grove Of branching oaks a rural palace old Imbosoms. there dwells Albert, generous lord Of all the harvest round. and onward thence A low plain chapel fronts the morning light Fast by a silent riv'let. Humbly walk, O stranger, o'er the consecrated ground; And on that verdant hilloc, which thou see'st Beset with osiers, let thy pious hand Sprinkle fresh water from the brook and strew Sweet-smelling flow'rs. for there doth Edmund rest, The learned shepherd; for each rural art Fam'd, and for songs harmonious, and the woes Of ill-requited love. The faithless pride Of fair Matilda sank him to the grave In manhood's prime. But soon did righteous heaven With tears, with sharp remorse, and pining care, Avenge her falshood. nor could all the gold And nuptial pomp, which lur'd her plighted faith From Edmund to a loftier husband's home, Relieve her breaking heart, or turn aside The strokes of death. Go, traveller; relate The mournful story. haply some fair maid May hold it in remembrance, and be taught That riches cannot pay for truth or love. IV. [O youths and virgins: O declining eld]O youths and virgins: O declining eld: O pale misfortune's slaves: O ye who dwell Unknown with humble quiet; ye who wait In courts, or fill the golden seat of kings: O sons of sport and pleasure: O thou wretch That weep'st for jealous love, or the sore wounds Of conscious guilt, or death's rapacious hand Which left thee void of hope: O ye who roam In exile; ye who through the embattled field Seek bright renown; or who for nobler palms Contend, the leaders of a public cause; Approach: behold this marble. Know ye not The features? Hath not oft his faithful tongue Told you the fashion of your own estate, The secrets of your bosom? Here then, round His monument with reverence while ye stand, Say to each other: “This was Shakespear's form; “Who walk'd in every path of human life, “Felt every passion; and to all mankind “Doth now, will ever that experience yield “Which his own genius only could acquire.” The fifth inscription in Latin has been excluded. VI. For a Column at RUNNYMEDE. Thou, who the verdant plain dost traverse here, While Thames among his willows from thy view Retires; O stranger, stay thee, and the scene Around contemplate well. This is the place Where England's ancient barons, clad in arms And stern with conquest, from their tyrant king (Then render'd tame) did challenge and secure The charter of thy freedom. Pass not on Till thou have bless'd their memory, and paid Those thanks which God appointed the reward Of public virtue. And if chance thy home Salute thee with a father's honour'd name, Go, call thy sons: instruct them what a debt They owe their ancestors; and make them swear To pay it, by transmitting down intire Those sacred rights to which themselves were born, ODE. By the Same. [If rightly tuneful bards decide] I If rightly tuneful bards decide, If it be fix'd in love's decrees, That beauty ought not to be tried But by its native power to please, Then tell me, youths and lovers, tell, What fair can Amoret excell? II Behold that bright unsullied smile, And wisdom speaking in her mien: Yet (she so artless all the while, So little studious to be seen) We nought but instant gladness know, Nor think to whom the gift we owe. III But neither music, nor the powers Of youth and mirth and frolick cheer, Add half that sunshine to the hours, Or make life's prospect half so clear, As memory brings it to the eye From scenes where Amoret was by. IV Yet nor a satirist could there Or fault or indiscretion find; Nor any prouder sage declare One virtue, pictur'd in his mind, Whose form with lovelier colours glows Than Amoret's demeanor shows. V This sure is beauty's happiest part: This gives the most unbounded sway: This shall inchant the subject heart When rose and lily fade away; And She be still, in spite of time, Sweet Amoret in all her prime. ODE TO THE TIBER. WRITTEN ABROAD. By WILLIAM WHITEHEAD, Esq; On entering the Campania of Rome, at Otricoli, MDCCLV. I. Hail sacred Stream, whose waters roll Immortal thro' the classic page! To Thee the Muse-devoted soul, Tho' destin'd to a later age And less indulgent clime, to Thee, Nor thou disdain, in runic lays Weak mimic of true harmony, His grateful homage pays. Far other strains thine elder ear With pleas'd attention wont to hear, When he, who strung the Latian lyre, And he, who led th'Aonian quire From Mantua's reedy lakes with osiers crown'd, Taught Echo from thy banks with transport to resound. Thy banks?—alas, is this the boasted scene, This dreary, wide, uncultivated plain, Where sick'ning Nature wears a fainter green, And Desolation spreads her torpid reign? In this the scene where Freedom breath'd, Her copious horn where Plenty wreath'd, And Health at opening day Bade all her roseate breezes fly, To wake the sons of Industry, And make their fields more gay? II. Where is the villa's rural pride, The swelling dome's imperial gleam, Which lov'd to grace thy verdant side, And tremble in thy golden stream? Where are the bold, the busy throngs, That rush'd impatient to the war, Or tun'd to peace triumphal songs, And hail'd the passing car? Along the solitary The Flaminian way. road, Th'eternal flint by Consuls trod, We muse, and mark the sad decays Of mighty works, and mighty days! For these vile wastes, we cry, had Fate decreed That Veii's sons should strive, for these Camillus bleed? Did here, in after-times of Roman pride, The musing shepherd from Soracte's height See towns extend where'er thy waters glide, And temples rise, and peopled farms unite? They did. For this deserted plain The Hero strove, nor strove in vain: And here the shepherd saw Unnumber'd towns and temples spread, While Rome majestic rear'd her head, And gave the nations law. III. Yes, Thou and Latium once were great. And still, ye first of human things, Beyond the grasp of time or fate Her fame and thine triumphant springs. What tho' the mould'ring columns fall, And strow the desart earth beneath, Tho' ivy round each nodding wall Entwine its fatal wreath, Yet say, can Rhine or Danube boast The numerous glories thou hast lost? Can ev'n Euphrates' palmy shore, Or Nile, with all his mystic lore, Produce from old records of genuine fame Such heroes, poets, kings, or emulate thy name? Ev'n now the Muse, the conscious Muse is here; From every ruin's formidable shade Eternal Music breathes on Fancy's ear, And wakes to more than form th'illustrious dead. Thy Cæsars, Scipios, Catos rise, The great, the virtuous, and the wise, In solemn state advance! They fix the philosophic eye, Or trail the robe, or lift on high The light'ning of the lance. IV. But chief that humbler happier train Who knew those virtues to reward Beyond the reach of chance or pain Secure, th'historian and the bard. By them the hero's generous rage Still warm in youth immortal lives; And in their adamantine page Thy glory still survives. Thro' deep Savannahs wild and vast, Unheard, unknown thro' ages past, Beneath the sun's directer beams What copious torrents pour their streams! No fame have they, no fond pretence to mourn, No annals swell their pride, or grace their storied urn. Whilst Thou, with Rome's exalted genius joins, Her spear yet lifted, and her corslet brac'd, Can'st tell the waves, can'st tell the passing wind Thy wond'rous tale, and cheer the list'ning waste. Tho' from his caves th'unfeeling North Pour'd all his legion'd tempests forth, Yet still thy laurels bloom: One deathless glory still remains, Thy stream has roll'd thro' Latian plains, Has wash'd the walls of Rome. ELEGIES. By the Same. ELEGY I. Written at the Convent of Haut Villers in Champagne, 1754. Silent and clear, thro' yonder peaceful vale, While Marne's slow waters weave their mazy way, See, to th'exulting sun, and fost'ring gale, What boundless treasures his rich banks display! Fast by the stream, and at the mountain's base, The lowing herds thro' living pastures rove; Wide-waving harvests crown the rising space; And still superior nods the viny grove. High on the top, as guardian of the scene, Imperial Sylvan spreads his umbrage wide; Nor wants there many a cot, and spire between, Or in the vale, or on the mountain's side, To mark that Man, as tenant of the whole, Claims the just tribute of his culturing care, Yet pays to Heaven, in gratitude of soul, The boon which Heaven accepts, of praise and prayer. O dire effects of war! the time has been When Desolation vaunted here her reign; One ravag'd desart was yon beauteous scene, And Marne ran purple to the frighted Seine. Oft at his work the toilsome day to cheat The swain still talks of those disastrous times, When Guise's pride, and Condé's ill-star'd heat Taught christian zeal to authorize their crimes: Oft to his children sportive on the grass Does dreadful tales of worn Tradition tell, Oft points to Epernay's ill-fated pass Where Force thrice triumph'd, and where Biron fell. O dire effects of war!—may ever more Thro' this sweet vale the voice of discord cease! A British bard to Gallia's fertile shore Can wish the blessings of eternal peace. Yet say, ye monks, (beneath whose moss-grown seat, Within whose cloister'd cells th'indebted Muse Awhile sojourns, for meditation meet, And these loose thoughts in pensive strain pursues,) Avails it aught, that War's rude tumult spare Yon cluster'd vineyard, or yon golden field, If niggards to yourselves, and fond of care, You slight the joys their copious treasures yield? Avails it aught that Nature's liberal hand With every blessing grateful man can know Cloaths the rich bosom of yon smiling land, The mountain's sloping side, or pendant brow, If meagre Famine paint your pallid cheek, If breaks the midnight bell your hours of rest, If 'midst heart-chilling damps, and winter bleak, You shun the cheerful bowl, and moderate feast! Look forth, and be convinc'd! 'tis Nature pleads, Her ample volume opens on your view, The simple-minded swain, who running reads, Feels the glad truth, and is it hid from you? Look forth, and be convinc'd. Yon prospects wide To Reason's ear how forcibly they speak, Compar'd with those how dull is letter'd Pride, And Austin's babbling Eloquence how weak! Temp'rance, not Abstinence, in every bliss Is Man's true joy, and therefore Heaven's command. The wretch who riots thanks his God amiss: Who starves, rejects the bounties of his hand. Mark, while the Marne in yon full channel glides, How smooth his course, how Nature smiles around! But should impetuous torrents swell his tides, The fairy landskip sinks in oceans drown'd. Nor less disastrous should his thrifty urn Neglected leave the once well-water'd land, To dreary wastes yon paradise would turn, Polluted ooze, or heaps of barren sand. ELEGY II. On the Mausoleum of AUGUSTUS. To the Right Honourable George Bussy Villiers, Viscount Villiers. Written at Rome, 1756. It is now a garden belonging to Marchese di Corré. Amid these mould'ring walls, this marble round, Where slept the Heroes of the Julian name, Say, shall we linger still in thought profound, And meditate the mournful paths to fame? What tho' no cypress shades, in funeral rows, No sculptur'd urns, the last records of Fate, O'er the shrunk terrace wave their baleful boughs, Or breathe in storied emblems of the great; Yet not with heedless eye will we survey The scene tho' chang'd, nor negligently tread; These variegated walks, however gay, Were once the silent mansions of the dead. In every shrub, in every flow'ret's bloom That paints with different hues yon smiling plain, Some Hero's ashes issue from the tomb, And live a vegetative life again. For matter dies not, as the Sages say, But shifts to other forms the pliant mass, When the free spirit quits its cumb'rous clay, And sees, beneath, the rolling Planets pass. Perhaps, my Villiers, for I sing to Thee, Perhaps, unknowing of the bloom it gives, In yon fair scyon of Apollo's tree The sacred dust of young Marcellus lives. Pluck not the leaf—'twere sacrilege to wound Th'ideal memory of so sweet a shade; In these sad seats an early grave he found, And He is said to be the first person buried in this monument. the first rites to gloomy Dis convey'd. Witness Quantus ille virum magnum Mavortis ad urbem Campus aget gemitus! thou Field of Mars, that oft hadst known His youthful triumphs in the mimic war, Thou heardst the heart-felt universal groan When o'er thy bosom roll'd the funeral car. Witness ? Vel quæ, Tyberine, videbis Funera, cum tumulum præterlabere recentem. Virg. thou Tuscan stream, where oft he glow'd In sportive strugglings with th'opposing wave, Fast by the recent tomb thy waters flow'd While wept the wise, the virtuous, and the brave. O lost too soon!—yet why lament a fate By thousands envied, and by Heaven approv'd. Rare is the boon to those of longer date To live, to die, admir'd, esteem'd, belov'd. Weak are our judgments, and our passions warm, And slowly dawns the radiant morn of truth, Our expectations hastily we form, And much we pardon to ingenuous youth. Too oft we satiate on th'applause we pay To rising Merit, and resume the Crown; Full many a blooming genius, snatch'd away, Has fallen lamented who had liv'd unknown. For hard the task, O Villiers, to sustain Th'important burthen of an early fame; Each added day some added worth to gain, Prevent each wish, and answer every claim. Be thou Marcellus, with a length of days! But O remember, whatsoe'er thou art, The most exalted breath of human praise To please indeed must echo from the heart. Tho' thou be brave, be virtuous, and be wise, By all, like him, admir'd, esteem'd, belov'd, 'Tis from within alone true Fame can rise, The only happy, is the Self-approv'd. ELEGY III. To the Right Honourable George Simon Harcourt, Visc. Newnham. Written at Rome, 1756. Yes, noble Youth, 'tis true; the softer arts, The sweetly-sounding string, and pencil's pow'r, Have warm'd to rapture even heroic hearts, And taught the rude to wonder, and adore. For Beauty charms us, whether she appears In blended colours; or to soothing sound Attunes her voice; or fair proportion wears In yonder swelling dome's harmonious round. All, all she charms; but not alike to all 'Tis given to revel in her blissful bower; Coercive ties, and Reason's powerful call Bid some but taste the sweets, which some devour. When Nature govern'd, and when Man was young, Perhaps at will th'untutor'd Savage rov'd, Where waters murmur'd, and where clusters hung He fed, and slept beneath the shade he lov'd. But since the Sage's more sagacious mind, By Heaven's permission, or by Heaven's command, To polish'd states has social laws assign'd, And general good on partial duties plann'd, Not for ourselves our vagrant steps we bend As heedless Chance, or wanton Choice ordain; On various stations various tasks attend, And Men are born to trifle or to reign. As chaunts the woodman whilst the Dryads weep, And falling forests fear th'uplifted blow, As chaunts the shepherd, while he tends his sheep, Or weaves to pliant forms the osier bough, To me 'tis given, whom Fortune loves to lead Thro' humbler toils to life's sequester'd bowers, To me 'tis given to wake th'amusive reed, And sooth with song the solitary hours. But Thee superior soberer toils demand, Severer paths are thine of patriot fame; Thy birth, thy friends, thy king, thy native land, Have given thee honors, and have each their claim. Then nerve with fortitude thy feeling breast Each wish to combat, and each pain to bear; Spurn with disdain th'inglorious love of rest, Nor let the syren Ease approach thine ear. Beneath yon cypress shade's eternal green See prostrate Rome her wond'rous story tell, Mark how she rose the world's imperial queen, And tremble at the prospect how she fell! Not that my rigid precepts would require A painful strugling with each adverse gale, Forbid thee listen to th'enchanting Lyre, Or turn thy steps from Fancy's flowery vale. Whate'er of Greece in sculptur'd brass survives, Whate'er of Rome in mould'ring arcs remains, Whate'er of Genius on the canvass lives, Or flows in polish'd verse, or airy strains, Be these thy leisure; to the chosen few, Who dare excel, thy fost'ring aid afford; Their arts, their magic powers with honors due Exalt; but be thyself what they record. ELEGY IV. To an OFFICER. Written at Rome, 1756. From Latian fields, the mansions of Renown, Where fix'd the Warrior God his fated seat; Where infant Heroes learnt the martial frown, And little hearts for genuine glory beat; What for my friend, my soldier, shall I frame? What nobly glowing verse that breathes of arms, To point his radiant path to deathless fame, By great examples, and terrific charms? Quirinus first, with bold, collected bands, The sinewy sons of strength, for empire strove; Beneath his thunder bow'd th'astonish'd lands, And temples rose to Mars, and to Feretrian Jove. War taught contempt of death, contempt of pain, And hence the Fabii, hence the Decii come: War urg'd the slaughter, tho' she wept the slain, Stern War, the rugged nurse of virtuous Rome. But not from antique fables will I draw, To fire thy feeling soul, a dubious aid, Tho' now, ev'n now, they strike with rev'rent awe, By Poets or Historians sacred made. Nor yet to thee the babling Muse shall tell What mighty Kings with all their legions wrought, What cities sunk, and storied nations fell When Cæsar, Titus, or when Trajan fought, From private worth, and Fortune's private ways Whilst o'er yon hill th'exalted The trophies of Marius, now erected before the Capitol. Trophy shows To what vast heights of incorrupted praise The great, the self-ennobled Marius rose. From steep Arpinum's rock-invested shade, From hardy Virtue's emulative school His daring flight th'expanding Genius made, And by obeying nobly learnt to rule. Abash'd, confounded, stern Iberia groan'd, And Afric trembled to her utmost coasts; When the proud land its destin'd Conqueror own'd In the new Consul, and his veteran hosts. Yet Chiefs are madmen, and Ambition weak, And mean the joys the laurel'd harvests yield, If Virtue fail. Let Fame, let Envy speak Of Capsa's walls, and Sextia's watry field. But sink for ever, in oblivion cast, Dishonest triumphs, and ignoble spoils. Minturnæ's Marsh severely paid at last The guilty glories gain'd in civil broils. Nor yet his vain contempt the Muse shall praise For scenes of polish'd life, and letter'd worth; The steel-rib'd Warrior wants not Envy's ways To darken theirs, or call his merits forth, Witness yon Cimbrian Trophies!—Marius, there Thy ample pinion found a space to fly; As the plum'd eagle soaring sails in air, In upper air, and scorns a middle sky. Thence too thy country claim'd thee for her own, And bade the Sculptor's toil thy acts adorn, To teach in characters of living stone Eternal lessons to the youth unborn. For wisely Rome her warlike Sons rewards With the sweet labours of her Artists' hands; He wakes her Graces, who her empire guards, And both Minervas join in willing bands. O why, Britannia, why untrophied pass The patriot deeds thy godlike Sons display, Why breathes on high no monumental brass, Why swells no Arc to grace Culloden's Day? Wait we till faithless France submissive bow Beneath that Hero's delegated spear, Whose light'ning smote Rebellion's haughty brow, And scatter'd her vile rout with horror in the rear? O Land of Freedom, Land of Arts, assume That graceful dignity thy merits claim; Exalt thy Heroes like imperial Rome, And build their virtues on their love of fame. So shall the modest worth, which checks my friend, Forget its blush when rous'd by Glory's charms; From breast to breast the generous warmth descend, And still new trophies rise, at once, to Arts, and Arms. ELEGY V. To a FRIEND Sick. Written at Rome, 1756. 'Twas in this The Insula Tiberina, where there are still some small remains of the famous temple of Æsculapius. isle, O Wright indulge my lay, Whose naval form divides the Tuscan flood, In the bright dawn of her illustrious day Rome fix'd her Temple to the healing God. Here stood his altars, here his arm he bared, And round his mystic staff the serpent twin'd, Through crowded portals hymns of praise were heard, And victims bled, and sacred seers divin'd. On every breathing wall, on every round Of column, swelling with proportion'd grace, Its stated seat some votive tablet found, And storied wonders dignified the place. Oft from the balmy blessings of repose, And the cool stillness of the night's deep shade, To light and health th'exulting Votarist rose, Whilst fancy work'd with med'cine's powerful aid. Oft in his dreams (no longer clogg'd with fears Of some broad torrent, or some headlong steep, With each dire form Imagination wears When harrass'd Nature sinks in turbid sleep) Oft in his dreams he saw diffusive day Through bursting glooms its cheerful beams extend; On billowy clouds saw sportive Genii play, And bright Hygeia from her heaven descend. What marvel then, that man's o'erflowing mind Should wreath-bound columns raise, and altars fair, And grateful offerings pay, to Powers so kind, Tho' fancy-form'd, and creatures of the Air. Who that has writh'd beneath the scourge of pain, Or felt the burthen'd languor of disease, But would with joy the slightest respite gain, And idolize the hand which lent him ease? To Thee, my friend, unwillingly to thee For truths like these the anxious Muse appeals. Can Memory answer from affliction free, Or speaks the sufferer what, I fear, he feels? No, let me hope ere this in Romely grove Hygeia revels with the blooming Spring, Ere this the vocal seats the Muses love With hymns of praise, like Pæon's temple, ring. It was not written in the book of Fate That, wand'ring far from Albion's sea-girt plain, Thy distant Friend should mourn thy shorter date, And tell to alien woods and streams his pain. It was not written. Many a year shall roll, If aught th'inspiring Muse aright presage, Of blameless intercourse from Soul to Soul, And friendship well matur'd from Youth to Age. ELEGY VI. To another FRIEND. Written at Rome, 1756. Behold, my friend, to this small The medal of Marcus Aurelius. orb confin'd The genuine features of Aurelius' face; The father, friend, and lover of his kind, Shrunk to a narrow coin's contracted space. Not so his fame; for erst did heaven ordain Whilst seas should waft us, and whilst suns should warm, On tongues of men, the friend of man should reign, And in the arts he lov'd the patron charm. Oft as amidst the mould'ring spoils of Age, His moss-grown monuments my steps pursue; Oft as my eye revolves the historic page, Where pass his generous acts in fair review, Imagination grasps at many things, Which men, which angels might with rapture see; Then turns to humbler scenes its safer wings, And, blush not whilst I speak it, thinks on thee. With all that firm benevolence of mind, Which pities, whilst it blames, th'unfeeling vain, With all that active zeal to serve mankind, That tender suffering for another's pain, Why wert not thou to thrones imperial rais'd? Did heedless Fortune slumber at thy birth, Or on thy virtues with indulgence gaz'd, And gave her grandeurs to her sons of earth? Happy for thee, whose less distinguished sphere Now cheers in private the delighted eye, For calm Content, and smiling Ease are there, And, Heav'n's divinest gift, sweet Liberty. Happy for me, on life's serener flood Who sail, by talents as by choice restrain'd, Else had I only shar'd the general good, And lost the friend the Universe had gain'd. The Lyric Muse to Mr. MASON. On the Recovery of the Right Honourable the Earl of Holdernesse from a dangerous Illness. By the Same. Mason, snatch the votive Lyre, D'Arcy lives, and I inspire. 'Tis the Muse that deigns to ask, Can thy hand forget its task? Or can the Lyre its strains refuse To the Patron of the Muse? Hark, what notes of artless love The feather'd poets of the grove, Grateful for the bowers they fill, Warble wild on Sion hill; In tuneful tribute duely paid To the Master of the shade! And shall the Bard sit fancy-proof Beneath the hospitable roof, Where every menial face affords Raptur'd thoughts that want but words? And the Patron's dearer part, The gentle sharer of his heart, Wears her wonted charms again. Time, that felt Affliction's chain, Learns on lighter wings to move; And the tender pledge of love, Sweet Amelia, now is prest With double transport to her breast. Sweet Amelia, thoughtless why, Imitates the general joy; Innocent of care or guile See the lovely Mimic smile, And, as the heart-felt raptures rise, Catch them from her Mother's eyes. Does the noisy town deny Soothing airs, and extacy? Sion's shades afford retreat, Thither bend thy pilgrim feet. There bid th'imaginary train, Coinage of the Poet's brain, Not only in effects appear, But forms, and limbs, and features wear. Let festive Mirth, with flow'rets crown'd, Lightly tread the measur'd round; And Peace, that seldom knows to share The Statesman's friendly bowl, be there; While rosy Health, superior guest, Loose to the Zephyrs bares her breast; And, to add a sweeter grace, Give her soft Amelia's face. Mason, why this dull delay? Haste, to Sion haste away. There the Muse again shall ask, Nor thy hand forget its task; Nor the Lyre its strains refuse To the Patron of the Muse. On the Immortality of the Soul. Translated From the Latin of Isaac Hawkins Brown, Esq; By SOAME JENNYNS, Esq; BOOK I. To all inferior animals 'tis giv'n T'enjoy the state allotted them by Heaven; No vain researches e'er disturb their rest, No fears of dark futurity molest. Man, only Man solicitous to know The springs whence Nature's operations flow, Plods through a dreary waste with toil and pain, And reasons, hopes, and thinks, and lives in vain; For sable Death still hov'ring o'er his head, Cuts short his progress, with his vital thread. Wherefore, since Nature errs not, do we find These seeds of Science in the human mind, If no congenial fruits are predesign'd? For what avails to man this pow'r to roam Thro' ages past, and ages yet to come, T'explore new worlds o'er all th'ætherial way, Chain'd to a spot, and living but a day? Since all must perish in one common grave, Nor can these long laborious searches save, Were it not wiser far, supinely laid, To sport with Phyllis in the noontide shade? Or at thy jovial festivals appear, Great Bacchus, who alone the soul can clear From all that it has felt, and all that it can fear? Come on then, let us feast: let Chloe sing, And soft Neæra touch the trembling string; Enjoy the present hour, nor seek to know What good or ill to-morrow may bestow. But these delights soon pall upon the taste; Let's try then if more serious cannot last: Wealth let us heap on wealth, or fame pursue, Let pow'r and glory be our points in view: In courts, in camps, in senates let us live, Our levees crowded like the buzzing hive: Each weak attempt the same sad lesson brings, Alas, what vanity in human things! What means then shall we try? where hope to find A friendly harbour for the restless mind? Who still, you see, impatient to obtain Knowledge immense, (so Nature's laws ordain) Ev'n now, tho' fetter'd in corporeal clay, Climbs step by step the prospect to survey, And seeks, unweary'd, Truth's eternal ray. No fleeting joys she asks, which must depend On the frail senses, and with them must end; But such as suit her own immortal fame, Free from all change, eternally the same. Take courage then, these joys we shall attain; Almighty Wisdom never acts in vain; Nor shall the soul, on which it has bestow'd Such pow'rs, e'er perish, like an earthly clod; But purg'd at length from foul corruption's stain, Freed from her prison, and unbound her chain, She shall her native strength, and native skies regain: To heav'n an old inhabitant return, And draw nectareous streams from truth's perpetual urn. Whilst life remains, (if life it can be call'd T'exist in fleshly bondage thus enthrall'd) Tir'd with the dull pursuit of worldly things, The soul scarce wakes, or opes her gladsome wings, Yet still the godlike exile in disgrace Retains some marks of her celestial race; Else whence from Mem'ry's store can she produce Such various thoughts, or range them so for use? Can matter these contain, dispose, apply? Can in her cells such mighty treasures lye? Or can her native force produce them to the eye? Whence is this pow'r, this foundress of all arts, Serving, adorning life, thro' all its parts, Which names impos'd, by letters mark'd those names, Adjusted properly by legal claims, From woods, and wilds collected rude mankind, And cities, laws, and governments design'd? What can this be, but some bright ray from heaven, Some emanation from Omniscience given? When now the rapid stream of Eloquence Bears all before it, passion, reason, sense, Can its dread thunder, or its lightning's force Derive their essence from a mortal source? What think you of the bard's enchanting art, Which, whether he attempts to warm the heart With fabled scenes, or charm the ear with rhyme, Breathes all pathetic, lovely, and sublime? Whilst things on earth roll round from age to age, The same dull farce repeated; on the stage The poet gives us a creation new, More pleasing, and more perfect than the true; The mind, who always to perfection hastes; Perfection, such as here she never tastes, With gratitude accepts the kind deceit, And thence foresees a system more compleat. Of those what think you, who the circling race Of suns, and their revolving planets trace, And comets journeying thro' unbounded space? Say, can you doubt, but that th'all-searching soul, That now can traverse heav'n from pole to pole, From thence descending visits but this earth, And shall once more regain the regions of her birth? Could she thus act, unless some Power unknown, From matter quite distinct, and all her own, Supported, and impell'd her? She approves Self-conscious, and condemns, she hates, and loves, Mourns, and rejoices, hopes, and is afraid, Without the body's unrequested aid: Her own internal strength her reason guides, By this she now compares things, now divides; Truth's scatter'd fragments piece by piece collects, Rejoins, and thence her edifice erects; Piles arts on arts, effects to causes ties, And rears th'aspiring fabric to the skies: From whence, as on a distant plain below, She sees from causes consequences flow, And the whole chain distinctly comprehends, Which from th'Almighty's throne to earth descends: And lastly, turning inwardly her eyes, Perceives how all her own ideas rise, Contemplates what she is, and whence she came, And almost comprehends her own amazing frame. Can mere machines be with such pow'rs endued, Or conscious of those pow'rs, suppose they cou'd? For body is but a machine alone Mov'd by external force, and impulse not its own. Rate not the extension of the human mind By the plebeian standard of mankind, But by the size of those gigantic few, Whom Greece and Rome still offer to our view; Or Britain well-deserving equal praise, Parent of heroes too in better days. Why should I try her num'rous sons to name By verse, law, eloquence consign'd to fame? Or who have forc'd fair Science into sight Long lost in darkness, and afraid of light. O'er all superior, like the solar ray First Bacon usher'd in the dawning day, And drove the mists of sophistry away; Pervaded nature with amazing force, Following experience still throughout his course, And finishing at length his destin'd way, To Newton he bequeathed the radiant lamp of day. Illustrious souls! if any tender cares Affect angelic breasts for man's affairs, If in your present happy heav'nly state, You're not regardless quite of Britain's fate, Let this degen'rate land again be blest With that true vigour, which she once possest; Compel us to unfold our slumb'ring eyes, And to our ancient dignity to rise. Such wond'rous pow'rs as these must sure be given For most important purposes by heav'n; Who bids these stars as bright examples shine Besprinkled thinly by the hand divine, To form to virtue each degenerate time, And point out to the soul its origin sublime. That there's a self which after death shall live, All are concern'd about, and all believe; That something's ours, when we from life depart, This all conceive, all feel it at the heart; The wise of learn'd antiquity proclaim This truth, the public voice declares the same; No land so rude but looks beyond the tomb For future prospects in a world to come. Hence, without hopes to be in life repaid, We plant slow oaks posterity to shade; And hence vast pyramids aspiring high Lift their proud heads aloft, and time defy. Hence is our love of fame, a love so strong, We think no dangers great, or labors long, By which we hope our beings to extend, And to remotest times in glory to descend. For fame the wretch beneath the gallows lyes, Disowning every crime for which he dies; Of life profuse, tenacious of a name, Fearless of death, and yet afraid of shame. Nature has wove into the human mind This anxious care for names we leave behind, T'extend our narrow views beyond the tomb, And give an earnest of a life to come: For, if when dead, we are but dust or clay, Why think of what posterity shall say? Her praise, or censure cannot us concern, Nor ever penetrate the silent urn. What mean the nodding plumes, the fun'ral train, And marble monument that speaks in vain, With all those cares, which ev'ry nation pays To their unfeeling dead in diff'rent ways! Some in the flow'r-strewn grave the corpse have lay'd, And annual obsequies around it pay'd, As if to please the poor departed shade; Others on blazing piles the body burn, And store their ashes in the faithful urn; But all in one great principle agree To give a fancy'd immortality. Why should I mention those, whose ouzy soil Is render'd fertile by th'o'erflowing Nile, Their dead they bury not, nor burn with fires, No graves they dig, erect no fun'ral pires, But, washing first th'embowel'd body clean, Gums, spice, and melted pitch they pour within; Then with strong fillets bind it round and round, To make each flaccid part compact, and sound; And lastly paint the varnish'd surface o'er With the same features, which in life it wore: So strong their presage of a future state, And that our nobler part survives the body's fate. Nations behold remote from reason's beams, Where Indian Ganges rolls his sandy streams, Of life impatient rush into the fire, And willing victims to their Gods expire! Persuaded the loose soul to regions flies Blest with eternal spring, and cloudless skies. Nor is less fam'd the oriental wife For stedfast virtue, and contempt of life: These heroines mourn not with loud female cries Their husbands lost, or with o'erflowing eyes, But, strange to tell! their funeral piles ascend, And in the same sad flames their sorrows end; In hopes with them beneath the shades to rove, And there renew their interrupted love. In climes where Boreas breathes eternal cold, See numerous nations, warlike, fierce, and bold, To battle all unanimously run, Nor fire, nor sword, nor instant death they shun: Whence this disdain of life in ev'ry breast, But from a notion on their minds imprest, That all, who for their country die, are blest. Add too to these the once prevailing dreams, Of sweet Elysian groves, and Stygian streams: All shew with what consent mankind agree In the firm hope of Immortality. Grant these th'inventions of the crafty priest, Yet such inventions never could subsist. Unless some glimmerings of a future state Were with the mind coæval, and innate: For every fiction, which can long persuade, In truth must have its first foundations laid. Because we are unable to conceive, How unembody'd souls can act, and live, The vulgar give them forms, and limbs, and faces, And habitations in peculiar places; Hence reasoners more refin'd, but not more wise, Struck with the glare of such absurdities, Their whole existence sabulous suspect, And truth and falshood in a lump reject; Too indolent to learn what may be known, Or else too proud that ignorance to own. For hard's the task the daubing to pervade Folly and fraud on Truth's fair form have laid; Yet let that task be ours; for great the prize; Nor let us Truth's celestial charms despise, Because that priests, or poets may disguise. That there's a God from Nature's voice is clear, And yet what errors to this truth adhere? How have the fears and follies of mankind Now multiply'd their Gods, and now subjoin'd To each the frailties of the human mind? Nay superstition spread at length so wide, Beasts, birds, and onions too were deify'd. Th'Athenian sage revolving in his mind This weakness, blindness, madness of mankind, Foretold, that in maturer days, tho' late, When time should ripen the decrees of Fate, Some God would light us, like the rising day, Thro' error's maze, and chase these clouds away. Long since has Time fulfill'd this great decree, And brought us aid from this divinity. Well worth our search discoveries may be made By Nature, void of the celestial aid: Let's try what her conjectures then can reach, Nor scorn plain Reason, when she deigns to teach. That mind and body often sympathize Is plain; such is this union Nature ties: But then as often too they disagree, Which proves the soul's superior progeny. Sometimes the body in full strength we find. Whilst various ails debilitate the mind; At others, whilst the mind its force retains, The body sinks with sickness and with pains: Now did one common fate their beings end, Alike they'd sicken, and alike they'd mend. But sure experience, on the slightest view, Shews us, that the reverse of this is true; For when the body oft expiring lies, Its limbs quite senseless, and half clos'd its eyes, The mind new force, and eloquence acquires, And with prophetic voice the dying lips inspires. Of like materials were they both compos'd, How comes it, that the mind, when sleep has clos'd Each avenue of sense, expatiates wide Her liberty restor'd, her bonds unty'd? And like some bird who from its prison flies, Claps her exulting wings, and mounts the skies. Grant that corporeal is the human mind, It must have parts in infinitum join'd; And each of these must will, perceive, design, And draw confus'dly in a different line; Which then can claim dominion o'er the rest, Or stamp the ruling passion in the breast? Perhaps the mind is form'd by various arts Of modelling, and figuring these parts; Just as if circles wiser were than squares; But surely common sense aloud declares That site, and figure are as foreign quite From mental pow'rs, as colours black or white. Allow that motion is the cause of thought, With what strange pow'rs must motion then be fraught? Reason, sense, science, must derive their source From the wheel's rapid whirl, or pully's force; Tops whip'd by school-boys sages must commence, Their hoops, like them, be cudgel'd into sense, And boiling pots o'erflow with eloquence. Whence can this very motion take its birth? Not sure from matter, from dull clods of earth; But from a living spirit lodg'd within, Which governs all the bodily machine: Just as th'Almighty Universal Soul Informs, directs, and animates the whole. Cease then to wonder how th'immortal mind Can live, when from the body quite disjoin'd; But rather wonder, if she e'er cou'd die, So fram'd, so fashion'd for eternity; Self-mov'd, not form'd of parts together ty'd, Which time can dissipate, and force divide; For beings of this make can never die, Whose pow'rs within themselves, and their own essence lie. If to conceive how any thing can be From shape abstracted and locality Is hard; what think you of the Deity? His Being not the least relation bears, As far as to the human mind appears, To shape, or size, similitude or place, Cloath'd in no form, and bounded by no space. Such then is God, a Spirit pure refin'd From all material dross, and such the human mind. For in what part of essence can we see More certain marks of Immortality? Ev'n from this dark confinement with delight She looks abroad, and prunes herself for flight; Like an unwilling inmate longs to roam From this dull earth, and seek her native home. Go then forgetful of its toil and strife, Pursue the joys of this fallacious life; Like some poor sly, who lives but for a day, Sip the fresh dews, and in the sunshine play, And into nothing then dissolve away. Are these our great pursuits, is this to live? These all the hopes this much-lov'd world can give! How much more worthy envy is their fate, Who search for truth in a superior state? Not groping step by step, as we pursue, And following reason's much entangled clue, But with one great, and instantaneous view. But how can sense remain, perhaps you'll say, Corporeal organs if we take away! Since it from them proceeds, and with them must decay. Why not? or why may not the soul receive New organs, since ev'n art can these retrieve? The silver trumpet aids th'obstructed ear, And optic glasses the dim eye can clear; These in mankind new faculties create, And lift him far above his native state; Call down revolving planets from the sky, Earth's secret treasures open to his eye, The whole minute creation make his own, With all the wonders of a world unknown. How cou'd the mind, did she alone depend On sense, the errors of those senses mend? Yet oft, we see those senses she corrects, And oft their information quite rejects. In distances of things, their shapes and size, Our reason judges better than our eyes. Declares not this the soul's preheminence Superior to, and quite distinct from sense? For sure 'tis likely, that, since now so high Clogg'd and unfledg'd she dares her wings to try, Loos'd, and mature, she shall her strength display, And soar at length to Truth's refulgent ray. Inquire you how these pow'rs we shall attain, 'Tis not for us to know; our search is vain: Can any now remember or relate How he existed in the embryo state? Or one from birth insensible of day Conceive ideas of the solar ray? That light's deny'd to him, which others see, He knows, perhaps you'll say,—and so do we. The mind contemplative finds nothing here On earth, that's worthy of a wish or fear: He, whose sublime pursuit is God and truth, Burns, like some absent and impatient youth, To join the object of his warm desires, Thence to sequester'd shades, and streams retires, And there delights his passion to rehearse In wisdom's sacred voice, or in harmonious verse. To me most happy therefore he appears, Who having once, unmov'd by hopes or fears, Survey'd this sun, earth, ocean, clouds, and flame, Well satisfy'd returns from whence he came. Is life a hundred years, or e'er so few, 'Tis repetition all, and nothing new: A fair, where thousands meet, but none can stay, An inn, where travellers bait, then post away; A sea, where man perpetually is tost, Now plung'd in bus'ness, now in trifles lost: Who leave it first, the peaceful port first gain; Hold then! no farther launch into the main: Contract your sails; life nothing can bestow By long continuance, but continu'd woe: The wretched privilege daily to deplore The funerals of our friends, who go before: Diseases, pains, anxieties, and cares, And age surrounded with a thousand snares. But whither hurry'd by a generous scorn Of this vain world, ah, whither am I borne? Let's not unbid th'Almighty's standard quit, Howe'er severe our post, we must submit. Cou'd I a firm persuasion once attain That after death no being wou'd remain; To those dark shades I'd willingly descend, Where all must sleep, this drama at an end: Nor life accept, altho' renew'd by Fate Ev'n from its earliest, and its happiest state. Might I from Fortune's bounteous hand receive Each boon, each blessing in her pow'r to give, Genius, and science, morals, and good-sense, Unenvy'd honors, wit and eloquence, A numerous offspring to the world well known Both for paternal virtues, and their own; Ev'n at this mighty price I'd not be bound To tread the same dull circle round, and round; The soul requires enjoyments more sublime, By space unbounded, undestroy'd by time. BOOK II. God then thro' all creation gives, we find, Sufficient marks of an indulgent mind, Excepting in ourselves; ourselves of all His works the chief on this terrestrial ball, His own bright image, who alone unblest Feel ills perpetual, happy all the rest. But hold, presumptuous? charge not heav'n's decree With such injustice, such partiality. Yet true it is, survey we life around, Whole hosts of ills on ev'ry side are found; Who wound not here and there by chance a foe, But at the species meditate the blow. What millions perish by each others hands In war's fierce rage? or by the dread commands Of tyrants languish out their lives in chains, Or lose them in variety of pains? What numbers pinch'd by want and hunger die, In spite of Nature's liberality? (Those, still more numerous, I to name disdain, By lewdness, and intemperance justly slain;) What numbers, guiltless of their own disease, Are snatch'd by sudden death, or waste by slow degrees? Where then is Virtue's well deserv'd reward!— Let's pay to Virtue ev'ry due regard: That she enables man, let us confess, To bear those evils, which she can't redress; Gives hope, and conscious peace, and can assuage Th'impetuous tempests both of lust, and rage; Yet she's a guard so far from being sure, That oft her friends peculiar ills endure: Where Vice prevails severest is their fate, Tyrants pursue them with a three-fold hate. How many struggling in their country's cause, And from their country meriting applause, Have fall'n by wretches fond to be inslav'd, And perish'd by the hands themselves had sav'd? Soon as superior worth appears in view, See knaves, and fools united to pursue! The man so form'd they all conspire to blame, And Envy's pois'nous tooth attacks his fame; Shou'd he at length, so truly good and great, Prevail, and rule with honest views the state, Then must he toil for an ungrateful race, Submit to clamor, libels, and disgrace; Threaten'd, oppos'd, defeated in his ends, By foes seditious, and aspiring friends. Hear this and tremble! all who wou'd be great, Yet know not what attends that dang'rous wretched state. Is private life from all these evils free? Vice of all kinds, rage, envy there we see, Deceit, that Friendship's mask insidious wears, Quarrels, and feuds, and law's intangling snares. But there are pleasures still in human life, Domestic ease, a tender loving wife, Children, whose dawning smiles your heart engage, The grace, and comfort of soft-stealing age. If happiness exists, 'tis surely here— But are these joys exempt from care and fear? Need I the miseries of that state declare, When diff'rent passions draw the wedded pair? Or say how hard those passions to discern, Ere the die's cast, and 'tis too late to learn? Who can insure, that what is right, and good, These children shall pursue? or if they shou'd, Death comes, when least you fear so black a day, And all your blooming hopes are snatch'd away. We say not, that these ills from Virtue flow: Did her wise precepts rule the world, we know The golden ages wou'd again begin, But 'tis our lot in this to suffer, and to sin. Observing this, some sages have decreed That all things from two causes must proceed; Two principles with equal pow'r endu'd, This wholly evil, that supremely good. From this arise the miseries we endure, Whilst that administers a friendly cure; Hence life is chequer'd still with bliss, and woe, Hence tares with golden crops promiscuous grow, And poisonous serpents make their dread repose Beneath the covert of the fragrant rose. Can such a system satisfy the mind, Are both these Gods in equal pow'r conjoin'd, Or one superior? Equal if you say, Chaos returns, since neither will obey. Is one superior? good, or ill must reign, Eternal joy, or everlasting pain. Whiche'er is conquer'd must entirely yield, And the victorious God enjoy the field. Hence with these fictions of the Magi's brain! Hence ouzy Nile, with all her monstrous train! Or comes the Stoic nearer to the right? He holds, that whatsoever yields delight, Wealth, fame, externals all, are useless things; Himself half starving happier far than kings. 'Tis fine indeed to be so wond'rous wise! By the same reas'ning too he pain denies; Roast him, or flea him, break him on the wheel, Retract he will not, tho' he can't but feel: Pain's not an ill, he utters with a groan; What then? an inconvenience 'tis, he'll own. What? vigour, health, and beauty? are these good? No: they may be accepted, not pursued: Absurd to squabble thus about a name, Quibbling with diff'rent words, that mean the same. Stoic, were you not fram'd of flesh and blood, You might be blest without external good; But know, be self-sufficient as you can, You are not spirit quite, but frail, and mortal man. But since these sages, so absurdly wise, Vainly pretend enjoyments to despise, Because externals, and in Fortune's pow'r, Now mine, now thine, the blessings of an hour; Why value then, that strength of mind, they boast, As often varying, and as quickly lost? A head-ach hurts it, or a rainy day, And a slow fever wipes it quite away. See Lord Somers. one whose councils, one Duke of Marlborough. whose conqu'ring hand Once sav'd Britannia's almost sinking land: Examples of the mind's extensive pow'r, Examples too how quickly fades that flow'r. Dean Swift.Him let me add, whom late we saw excel In each politer kind of writing well; Whether he strove our follies to expose In easy verse, or droll and hum'rous prose; Few years, alas! compel his throne to quit This mighty monarch o'er the realms of wit, See self-surviving he's an ideot grown! A melancholy proof our parts are not our own. Thy tenets, Stoic, yet we may forgive, If in a future state we cease to live. For here the virtuous suffer much, 'tis plain; If pain is evil, this must God arraign; And on this principle confess we must, Pain can no evil be, or God must be unjust. Blind man! whose reason such strait bounds confine, That ere it touches truth's extremest line, It stops amaz'd, and quits the great design. Own you not, Stoic, God is just and true? Dare to proceed; secure this path pursue: 'Twill soon conduct you far beyond the tomb, To future justice, and a life to come. This path you say is hid in endless night, 'Tis self-conceit alone obstructs your sight, You stop, ere half your destin'd course is run, And triumph, when the conquest is not won; By this the Sophists were of old misled: See what a monstrous race from one mistake is bred! Hear then my argument:—confess we must, A God there is, supremely wise and just: If so, however things affect our sight, As sings our bard, whatever is, is right. But is it right, what here so oft appears, That vice shou'd triumph, virtue sink in tears? The inference then, that closes this debate, Is, that there must exist a future state. The wise extending their enquiries wide See how both states are by connection ty'd; Fools view but part, and not the whole survey, So crowd existence all into a day. Hence are they led to hope, but hope in vain, That Justice never will resume her reign; On this vain hope adulterers, thieves rely, And to this altar vile assassins fly. “But rules not God by general laws divine? “Man's vice, or virtues change not the design.” What laws are these? instruct us if you can:— There's one design'd for brutes, and one for man: Another guides inactive matter's course, Attracting, and attracted by its force: Hence mutual gravity subsists between Far distant worlds, and ties the vast machine. The laws of life why need I call to mind, Obey'd by birds, and beasts of ev'ry kind; By all the sandy desart's savage brood, And all the num'rous offspring of the flood; Of these none uncontroul'd, and lawless rove, But to some destin'd end spontaneous move. Led by that instinct, heav'n itself inspires, Or so much reason, as their state requires; See all with skill acquire their daily food, All use those arms, which Nature has bestow'd; Produce their tender progeny, and feed With care parental, whilst that care they need; In these lov'd offices compleatly blest, No hopes beyond them, nor vain fears molest. Man o'er a wider field extends his views; God thro' the wonders of his works pursues, Exploring thence his attributes, and laws, Adores, loves, imitates th'Eternal Cause; For sure in nothing we approach so nigh The great example of divinity, As in benevolence: the patriot's soul Knows not self-center'd for itself to roll, But warms, enlightens, animates the whole: Its mighty orb embraces first his friends, His country next, then man; nor here it ends, But to the meanest animal descends. Wise Nature has this social law confirm'd, By forming man so helpless, and unarm'd; His want of others' aid, and pow'r of speech T'implore that aid, this lesson daily teach. Mankind with other animals compare, Single how weak, and impotent they are! But view them in their complicated state, Their pow'rs how wond'rous, and their strength how great, When social virtue individuals joins, And in one solid mass, like gravity combines! This then's the first great law by Nature giv'n, Stamp'd on our souls, and ratify'd by Heav'n; All from utility this law approve, As ev'ry private bliss must spring from social love. Why deviate then so many from this law? See passions, custom, vice, and folly draw! Survey the rolling globe from East to West, How few, alas! how very few are blest? Beneath the frozen poles, and burning line, What poverty, and indolence combine, To cloud with Error's mists the human mind? No trace of man, but in the form we find. And are we free from error, and distress, Whom Heav'n with clearer light has pleas'd to bless? Whom true Religion leads? (for she but leads By soft persuasion, not by force proceeds;) Behold how we avoid this radiant sun! This proffer'd guide how obstinately shun, And after Sophistry's vain systems run! For these as for essentials we engage In wars, and massacres, with holy rage; Brothers by brothers' impious hands are slain, Mistaken Zeal, how savage is thy reign! Unpunish'd vices here so much abound, All right, and wrong, all order they confound; These are the giants, who the gods defy, And mountains heap on mountains to the sky. Sees this th'Almighty Judge, or seeing spares, And deems the crimes of man beneath his cares? He sees; and will at last rewards bestow, And punishments, not less assur'd for being slow. Nor doubt I, tho' this state confus'd appears, That ev'n in this God sometimes interferes: Sometimes, lest man should quite his pow'r disown, He makes that pow'r to trembling nations known: But rarely this; not for each vulgar end, As Superstition's idle tales pretend, Who thinks all foes to God, who are her own, Directs his thunder, and usurps his throne. Nor know I not, how much a conscious mind Avails to punish, or reward mankind; Ev'n in this life thou, impious wretch, must feel The Fury's scourges, and th'infernal wheel; From man's tribunal, tho' thou hop'st to run, Thyself thou can'st not, nor thy conscience shun: That must thou suffer, when each dire disease, The progeny of Vice, thy fabric seize? Consumption, fever, and the racking pain Of spasms, and gout, and stone, a frightful train! Then life new tortures can alone supply, Life thy sole hope thou'lt hate, yet dread to die. Shou'd such a wretch to num'rous years arrive, It can be little worth his while to live; No honors, no regards his age attend, Companions fly: he ne'er cou'd have a friend: His flatterers leave him, and with wild affright He looks within, and shudders at the sight: When threatning Death uplifts his pointed dart, With what impatience he applies to art, Life to prolong amidst disease and pains! Why this, if after it no sense remains? Why shou'd he chuse these miseries to endure, If Death cou'd grant an everlasting cure? 'Tis plain there's something whispers in his ear, (Tho' fain he'd hide it) he has much to fear. See the reverse! how happy those we find, Who know by merit to engage mankind? Prais'd by each tongue, by ev'ry heart belov'd, For Virtues practis'd, and for Arts improv'd: Their easy aspects shine with smiles serene, And all is peace, and happiness within: Their sleep is ne'er disturb'd by fears, or strife, Nor lust, nor wine, impair the springs of life. Him Fortune can not sink, nor much elate, Whose views extend beyond this mortal state; By age when summon'd to resign his breath, Calm, and serene, he sees approaching death, As the safe port, the peaceful silent shore, Where he may rest, life's tedious voyage o'er: He, and he only, is of death afraid, Whom his own conscience has a coward made; Whilst he, who Virtue's radiant course has run, Descends like a serenely-setting sun: His thoughts triumphant Heav'n alone employs, And hope anticipates his future joys. So good, so blest th'illustrious Bishop of Worcester. Hough we find, Whose image dwells with pleasure on my mind; The Mitre's glory, Freedom's constant friend, In times which ask'd a champion to defend; Who after near a hundred virtuous years, His senses perfect, free from pains and fears, Replete with life, with honors, and with age, Like an applauded actor left the stage; Or like some victor in th'Olympic games, Who having run his course, the crown of Glory claims. From this just contrast plainly it appears, How Conscience can inspire both hopes and fears; But whence proceed these hopes, or whence this dread, If nothing really can affect the dead? See all things join to promise, and presage The sure arrival of a future age! Whate'er their lot is here, the good and wise, Nor doat on life, nor peevishly despise. An honest man, when Fortune's storms begin, Has Consolation always sure within, And, if she sends a more propitious gale, He's pleas'd, but not forgetful it may fail. Nor fear that he, who sits so loose to life, Shou'd too much shun its labors, and its strife; And scorning wealth, contented to be mean, Shrink from the duties of this bustling scene; Or, when his country's safety claims his aid, Avoid the fight inglorious, and afraid: Who scorns life most must surely be most brave, And he, who pow'r contemns, be least a slave: Virtue will lead him to Ambition's ends, And prompt him to defend his country, and his friends. But still his merit you can not regard, Who thus pursues a posthumous reward; His soul, you cry, is uncorrupt and great, Who quite uninfluenc'd by a future state, Embraces Virtue from a nobler sense Of her abstracted, native excellence, From the self-conscious joy her essence brings, The beauty, fitness, harmony of things. It may be so: yet he deserves applause, Who follows where instructive Nature draws; Aims at rewards by her indulgence giv'n, And soars triumphant on her wings to heav'n. Say what this venal virtuous man pursues, No mean rewards, no mercenary views; Not wealth usurious, or a num'rous train, Not fame by fraud acquir'd, or title vain! He follows but where Nature points the road, Rising in Virtue's school, till he ascends to God. But we th'inglorious common herd of man, Sail without compass, toil without a plan; In Fortune's varying storms for ever tost, Shadows pursue, that in pursuit are lost; Mere infants all, till life's extremest day, Scrambling for toys, then tossing them away. Who rests of Immortality assur'd Is safe, whatever ills are here endur'd: He hopes not vainly in a world like this, To meet with pure uninterrupted bliss; For good and ill, in this imperfect state, Are ever mix'd by the decrees of Fate. With Wisdom's richest harvest Folly grows, And baleful hemlock mingles with the rose; All things are blended, changeable, and vain, No hope, no wish we perfectly obtain; God may perhaps (might human Reason's line Pretend to fathom infinite design) Have thus ordain'd things, that the restless mind No happiness compleat on earth may find; And, by this friendly chastisement made wise, To heav'n her safest, best retreat may rise. Come then, since now in safety we have past Thro' Error's rocks, and see the port at last, Let us review, and recollect the whole.— Thus stands my argument.—The thinking soul Cannot terrestrial, or material be, But claims by Nature Immortality: God, who created it, can make it end, We question not, but cannot apprehend He will; because it is by him endued With strong ideas of all perfect Good: With wond'rous pow'rs to know, and calculate Things too remote from this our earthly state; With sure presages of a life to come, All false and useless; if beyond the tomb Our beings cease: we therefore can't believe God either acts in vain, or can deceive. If ev'ry rule of equity demands, That Vice and Virtue from the Almighty's hands, Shou'd due rewards, and punishments receive, And this by no means happens whilst we live, It follows, that a time must surely come, When each shall meet their well-adjusted doom: Then shall this scene, which now to human sight Seems so unworthy Wisdom infinite, A system of consummate skill appear, And ev'ry cloud dispers'd, be beautiful and clear. Doubt we of this! what solid proof remains, That o'er the world a wise Disposer reigns? Whilst all Creation speaks a pow'r divine, Is it deficient in the main design? Not so: the day shall come, (pretend not now Presumptuous to enquire or when, or how) But after death shall come th'important day, When God to all his justice shall display; Each action with impartial eyes regard, And in a just proportion punish and reward. The Arbour: An Ode to Contentment. By Mr. THOMAS COLE. To these lone shades, where Peace delights to dwell, May Fortune oft permit me to retreat; Here bid the world, with all its cares, farewel, And leave its pleasures to the rich and great. Oft as the summer's sun shall cheer this scene, With that mild gleam which points his parting ray, Here let my soul enjoy each eve serene, Here share its calm, 'till life's declining day. No gladsome image then should 'scape my sight, From these gay flow'rs, which border near my eye, To yon bright cloud, that decks, with richest light, The gilded mantle of the western sky. With ample gaze, I'd trace that ridge remote, Where op'ning cliffs disclose the boundless main; With earnest ken, from each low hamlet note The steeple's summit peeping o'er the plain. What various works that rural landscape fill, Where mingling hedge-rows beauteous fields inclose; And prudent Culture, with industrious skill, Her chequer'd scene of crops and fallows shows? How should I love to mark that riv'let's maze, Through which it works its untaught course along; Whilst near its grassy banks the herd shall graze, And blithsome milkmaid chaunt her thoughtless song? Still would I note the shades of length'ning sheep, As scatter'd o'er the hill's slant brow they rove; Still note the day's last glimm'ring lustre creep From off the verge of yonder upland grove. Nor should my leisure seldom wait to view The slow-wing'd rooks in homeward train succeed; Nor yet forbear the swallow to pursue, With quicker glance, close skimming o'er the mead. But mostly here should I delight t'explore The bounteous laws of Nature's mystic pow'r; Then muse on him who blesseth all her store, And give to solemn thoughts the sober hour. Let Mirth unenvy'd laugh with proud disdain, And deem it spleen one moment thus to waste; If so she keep far hence her noisy train, Nor interrupt those joys she cannot taste. Far sweeter streams shall flow from Wisdom's spring, Than she receives from Folly's costliest bowl; And what delights can her chief dainties bring, Like those which feast the heavenly-pensive soul? Hail Silence then! be thou my frequent guest; For thou art wont my gratitude to raise, As high as wonder can the theme suggest, Whene'er I meditate my Maker's praise. What joy for tutor'd Piety to learn, All that my christian solitude can teach, Where weak-ey'd Reason's self may well discern Each clearer truth the gospel deigns to preach? No object here but may convince the mind, Of more than thoughtful honesty shall need; Nor can Suspense long question here to find Sufficient evidence to fix its creed. 'Tis God that gives this bow'r its aweful gloom; His arched verdure does its roof invest; He breathes the life of fragrance on its bloom; And with his kindness makes its owner blest. Oh! may the guidance of thy grace attend The use of all thy bounty shall bestow; Lest folly should mistake its sacred end, Or vice convert it into means of woe. Incline and aid me still my life to steer, As conscience dictates what to shun or chuse; Nor let my heart feel anxious hope or fear, For aught this world can give me or refuse. Then shall not wealth's parade one wish excite, For wretched state to barter peace away; Nor vain ambition's lure my pride invite, Beyond Contentment's humble path to stray. What tho' thy wisdom may my lot deny, The treasur'd plenty freely to dispense; Yet well thy goodness can that want supply With larger portions of benevolence. And sure the heart that wills the gen'rous deed, May all the joys of Charity command; For she best loves from notice to recede, And deals her unsought gifts with secret hand. Then will I sometimes bid my fancy steal, That unclaim'd wealth no property restrains; Soothe with fictitious aid my friendly zeal, And realize each godly act she feigns. So shall I gain the gold without alloy; Without oppression, toil, or treach'rous snares; So shall I know its use, its pow'r employ, And yet avoid its dangers and its cares. And spite of all that boastful wealth can do, In vain would Fortune strive the rich to bless, Were they not flatter'd with some distant view Of what she ne'er can give them to possess. E'en Wisdom's high conceit great wants would feel, If not supply'd from Fancy's boundless store; And nought but shame makes pow'r itself conceal, That she, to satisfy, must promise more. But tho' experience will not fail to show, Howe'er its truth man's weakness may upbraid, That what he mostly values here below, Owes half its relish to kind Fancy's aid; Yet should not Prudence her light wing command, She may too far extend her heedless flight; For Pleasure soon shall quit her fairy-land If Nature's regions are not held in sight. From Truth's abode, in search of kind deceit, Within due limits she may safely roam; If roving does not make her hate retreat, And with aversion shun her proper home. But thanks to those, whose fond parental care To Learning's paths my youthful steps confin'd, I need not shun a state which lets me share Each calm delight that soothes the studious mind. While genius lasts, his fame shall ne'er decay, Whose artful hand first caus'd its fruits to spread; In lasting volumes stampt the printed lay, And taught the Muses to embalm the dead. To him I owe each fair instructive page, Where Science tells me what her sons have known; Collects their choicest works from ev'ry age, And makes me wise with knowledge not my own. Books rightly us'd may ev'ry state secure: From fortune's evils may our peace defend; May teach us how to shun, or to endure, The foe malignant, and the faithless friend. Should rigid Want withdraw all outward aid, Kind stores of inward comfort they can bring; Should keen Disease life's tainted stream invade, Sweet to the soul from them pure health may spring. Should both at once man's weakly frame infest, Some letter'd charm may still relief supply; 'Gainst all events prepare his patient breast, And make him quite resign'd to live, or die. For tho' no words can time or fate restrain; No sounds suppress the call of Nature's voice; Tho' neither rhymes, nor spells, can conquer pain, Nor magic's self make wretchedness our choice; Yet reason, while it forms the subtile plan, Some purer source of pleasure to explore, Must deem it vain for that poor pilgrim, man, To think of resting 'till his journey's o'er; Must deem each fruitless toil, by heav'n design'd To teach him where to look for real bliss; Else why should heav'n excite the hope to find What balk'd pursuit must here for ever miss? The GROTTO: An Ode to Silence. By the Same. Come, musing Silence, nor refuse to shed Thy sober influence o'er this darkling cell: Thy desart waste and lonely plain, Could ne'er confine thy peaceful reign; Nor dost thou only love to dwell 'Mid the dark mansions of the vaulted dead: For still at eve's serenest hour, All Nature owns thy soothing pow'r: Oft hast thou deign'd with me to rove, Beneath the calm sequester'd grove; Oft deign'd my secret steps to lead Along the dewy pathless mead; Or up the dusky lawn, to spy The last faint gleamings of the twilight sky. Then wilt thou still thy pensive vot'ry meet, Oft as he calls thee to this gloomy seat: For here, with many a solemn mystic rite, Wert thou invok'd to consecrate the ground, Ere these rude walls were rear'd remote from sight, Or ere with moss this shaggy roof was crown'd Hail! blessed parent of each purer thought, That doth at once the heart exalt and mend! Here wilt thou never fail to find My vacant solitude inclin'd Thy serious lessons to attend. For they I ween shall be with goodness fraught, Whether thou bid me meditate On man, in untaught nature's state; How far this life he ought to prize; How far its transient scenes despise: What heights his reason may attain, And where its proud attempts are vain: What toils his virtue ought to brave, For Hope's rewarding joys beyond the grave: Or if in man redeem'd you bid me trace Each wond'rous proof of heav'n's transcendent grace; Then breathe some sparks of that celestial fire, Which in the raptur'd seraph glows above, Where sainted myriads crowd the joyful choir, And harp their praises round the throne of love. The trifling sons of Levity and Pride Hence shall thy aweful seriousness exclude; Nor shall loud Riot's thoughtless train With frantic mirth this grott profane. No foe to peace shall here intrude. For thou wilt kindly bid each sound subside, Save such as soothes the list'ning sense, And serves to aid thy influence: Save where, soft-breathing o'er the plain, Mild Zephyr waves the rustling grain: Or where some stream, from rocky source, Slow trickles down its ceaseless course: Or where the sea's imperfect roar Comes gently murm'ring from the distant shore. But most in Philomel, sweet bird of night, In plaintive Philomel, is thy delight: For she, or studious to prolong her grief, Or oft to vary her exhaustless lay, With frequent pause, from thee shall seek relief, Nor close her strain, till dawns the noisy day. Without thy aid, to happier tasteful art, No deep instructive science could prevail: For only where thou dost preside, Can wit's inventive pow'rs be tried: And reason's better task would fail, Did not thy haunts the serious theme impart. The critic, that with plodding head Toils o'er the learning of the dead; The cloister'd hermit that explores, By midnight lamp, religion's stores; Each sage that marks, with thoughtful gaze, The lunar orb, or planet's maze; And ev'ry bard, that strays along The sylvan shade, intent on sacred song; Shall all to thee those various praises give, Which, through thy friendly aid, themselves receive: For tho' thou mayst from glory's seats retire, Where loud applause proclaims the honour'd name; Yet doth thy modest wisdom still inspire Each nobler work that swells the voice of Fame. The Picture of HUMAN LIFE. Translated from the Greek of Cebes the Theban. By Mr. T. SCOTT. Et vitæ monstrata via est. Hor. While Saturn's This temple was probably in the city of Thebes, for Cebes was a Theban. fane with solemn step we trod, And view'd the Devout offerings, for the most part in discharge of vows. votive honours of the God, A pictur'd tablet, o'er the portal rais'd, Attach'd our eye: in wonder lost, we gaz'd. The pencil there some strange device had wrought, And fables, all its own, disguis'd the thought. Nor camp it seem'd, nor city: the design, Whose moral mock'd our labour to divine, Was a wall'd court, where rose another bound, And, higher still, a third still less'ning ground. The nether area open'd, at a gate Where a vast crowd impatient seem'd to wait. Within, a group of female figures stood, In motley dress, a sparkling multitude. Without, in station at the porch, was seen A venerable form, in act and mien Like some great teacher who with urgent tongue, Authoritative, warn'd the rushing throng. From doubt to doubt we wander'd; when appear'd A sire, who thus the hard solution clear'd. Strangers, that allegoric scene, I guess, Conquers your skill, our home-born wits no less. A foreigner, long since, whose nobler mind Learning's best culture to strong genius join'd, Here liv'd, convers'd, and shew'd th'admiring age Another Samian or Elean sage. He rear'd this dome to Saturn's aweful name, And gave that portrait to eternal same. He reason'd much, high argument he chose, High as his theme his great conceptions rose. Such wisdom flowing from a mouth but young I heard astonish'd, and enjoy'd it long: Him oft I heard this moral piece expound, With nervous eloquence and sense profound. Father, if leisure with thy will conspire, Yield, yield that comment to our warm desire. Free to bestow, I warn you first, beware: Danger impends, which summons all your care. Wise, virtuous, blest, whose heart our precepts gain, The Caselian and Salmasian editions read ??????? wicked, instead of ?????? bitter. Johnson.Abandon'd, blind, and wretched, who disdain. For know, our purpos'd theme resembles best The fam'd Enigma of the Theban pest: Th'interpreter a plighted crown enjoy'd, The stupid perish'd, by the Sphinx destroy'd. Count folly as a Sphinx to all mankind, Her problem, How is Good and Ill defin'd? Misjudging here, by Folly's law we die, Not instant victims of her cruelty; From day to day our reasoning part she wounds, Devours its strength, its noblest pow'rs confounds: Awakes the lash of Vid. v. 186. Punishment, and tears The mind with pangs which guilty life prepares, With opposite effect, where thoughtful skill Discerns the boundaries of Good and Ill, Folly must perish; and th'illumin'd breast To Virtue sav'd, is like th'immortals blest. Give audience, then, with no unheeding ear. O haste, no heedless auditors stand here, With strong desire, in dread suspence we wait, So great the blessing, and the bane so great. Instant, he rais'd his oratorial hand, And said (our eye he guided with a wand) Behold life's pencil'd scene, the natal gate, The numbers thronging into mortal state. Which danger's path, and which to safety bears, That ancient, Genius of mankind, declares. See him aloft, benevolent he bends, One hand is pointing, one a roll extends Reason's imperial code; by heav'n imprest In living letters on the human breast. Oppos'd to him, Delusion plies her part, With skin of borrow'd snow, and blush of art, With hypocritic fawn, and eyes askance Whence soft infection steals in every glance, Her faithless hand presents a crystal bowl, Whose pois'nous draught intoxicates the soul. Error and ignorance infus'd, compose The fatal beverage which her fraud bestows. Is that the hard condition of our birth? Must all drink Error who appear on earth? All; yet in some their measure drowns the mind, Others but taste, less erring and less blind. The first court, or the sensual life.Th'Opinions, and Desires, and Pleasures rise Behind the gate, thick-glitt'ring on our eyes; Thick as bright atoms in the solar ray, Diverse their drap'ry and profusely gay. These tempting forms, each like a mistress drest, Our early steps with powerful charms arrest: Soon as we enter life, with various art Of dalliance they assail th'unguarded heart. All promise joy, we rush to their embrace; To bliss or ruin here begins our race. Happy, thrice happy, who intrust their youth To right Opinions, and ascend to Truth: Whom Wisdom tutors, whom the Virtues hail, And with their own substantial feast regale. The rest are harlots: by their flatt'ries won, In chase of empty sciences we run: Or Fortune's vanities pursue, and stray With sensual Pleasure in more dang'rous way. See the mad rounds their giddy followers tread, Delusion's cup strong-working in their head. Fast as one shoal of fools have delug'd thro', Succeeding shoals the busy farce renew. Who on that globe stands stretching to her flight? Wild seems her aspect, and bereav'd of sight. Fortune, blind, frantic, deaf. With restless wings The world she ranges, and her favours flings: Flings and resumes, and plunders and bestows, Caprice divides the blessings and the woes. Her grace unstable as her tott'ring ball, Whene'er she smiles she meditates our fall. When most we trust her, we are cheated most, In desolating loss we mourn our boast: Her cruel blast invades our hasty fruit, And withers all our glory at the root. What mean those multitudes around her? Why Such motley attitudes perplex our eye? Some, in the act of wildest rapture, leap, In agony some wring their hands, and weep. Th'unreas'ning crowd; to passion's sequel blind, By passion fir'd and impotent of mind: Competitors in clamorous, suit to share The toys she tosses with regardless air; Trifles, for solid worth by most pursu'd, Bright-colour'd vapours and fantastic good: The pageantry of wealth, the blaze of fame, Titles, an offspring to extend the name, Huge strength, or beauty which the strong obey, The victor's laurel, and despotic sway. These, humour'd in their vows, with lavish praise The glory of the gracious goddess raise: Those other, losers in her chance-full game, Shorn of their all, or frustrate in their aim, In murmurs of their hard mishap complain, And curse her partial and malignant reign. Now, further still in this low sensual ground, Traverse yon flow'ry mount's sequester'd bound. In the green center of those citron shades, 'Mong gardens, fountains, bow'ry walks, and glades, Voluptuous Sin her pow'rful spells employs, Souls to seduce, seducing she destroys. See! Lewdness, loosely zon'd, her bosom bares, See! Riot her luxurious bowl prepares: There stands Avidity, with ardent eye, There dimpling Adulation smooths her lye. There station'd to what end? In watch for prey, Fortune's infatuate favourites of a day. These they caress, they flatter, they entreat To try the pleasures of their soft retreat, Life disencumber'd, frolicksom, and free, All ease. all mirth, and high felicity. Whome'er by their inveigling arts they win To tread that magic paradise of Sin, In airy dance his jocund hours skim round, Sparkles the bowl, the festal songs resound: His blood ferments, fir'd by the wanton glance, And his loose soul dissolves in am'rous trance. While circulating joys to joys succeed, While new delights the sweet delirium feed; The prodigal, in raptur'd fancy, roves O'er fairy fields and thro' Elysian groves: Sees glitt'ring visions in succession rise, And laughs at Socrates the chaste and wise. 'Till, sober'd by distress, awake, confus'd, Amaz'd, he knows himself a wretch abus'd; A short illusion his imagin'd feast, Himself the game, himself the slaughter'd beast. Now, raving for his squander'd wealth in vain, Slave to those tyrant jilts he drags their chain: Compell'd to suffer hard and hungry need, Compell'd to dare each foul and desp'rate deed. Villain, or knave, he joins the sharping tribe, Robs altars, or is perjur'd for a bribe: Stabs for a purse, his country pawns for gold, To every crime of blackest horror sold. Shiftless at length, of all resource bereft, In the dire gripe of Punishment he's left. Observe this strait-mouth'd cave: th'unwilling light Just shews the dismal deep descent to night. In centry see these haggard crones, whose brows Rude locks o'erhang, a frown their forehead plows: Swarthy and foul their shrivell'd skin behold, And flutt'ring shreds their vile defence from cold. High-brandishing her lash, with stern regard, Stands Punishment, an ever-waking ward; While sullen Melancholy mopes behind, Fix'd, with her head upon her knees reclin'd: And, frantic with remorseful fury, there Fierce Anguish stamps, and rends her shaggy hair. Who that ill-featur'd spectre of a man, Shiv'ring in nakedness, so spare and wan? And she, whose eye aghast with horror stares, Whose meagre form a sister's likeness bears? Loud Lamentation, wild Despair. All these, Fell vulturs, the devoted caitiff seize. Ah dreadful durance! with these fiends to dwell! What tongue the terrors of his soul can tell? Worry'd by these foul fiends, the wretch begins Sharp penance, wages of remember'd sins: Then deeper sinks, plung'd in the pit of Woe, Worse suff'rings in worse hell to undergo: Unless, rare guest, Repentance o'er the gloom Diffuse her radiance, and repeal his doom. She comes! meek-ey'd, array'd in grave attire, See Right Opinion, join'd with Good Desire, Handmaids of Truth: with those, an adverse pair (False Wisdom's minions, that deceiving fair) Attend her solemn step: the furies flee. Come forth, she calls, come forth to liberty, Guilt-harrass'd thrall: thy future lot decide, And, pond'ring well, elect thy future guide. Momentous option! chusing right he'll find A sov'reign med'cine for his ulcer'd mind; Led to True Wisdom, whose cathartic bowl Recovers and beatifies the soul. Misguided else, a counterfeit he'll gain, Whose art is only to amuse the brain: From vice to studious folly now he flies, From bliss still erring, still betray'd by lies. O heavens! where end the risks we mortals run? How dreadful this, and yet how hard to shun! Say, father, what distinctive marks declare That counterfeit of Wisdom? The second court, or the studious life.View her there. At yonder gate, with decent port, she stands, Her spotless form that second court commands: Styl'd Wisdom by the crowd, the thinking few Know her disguise, the phantom of the true: Skill'd in all learning, skill'd in ev'ry art To grace the head, not meliorate the heart. The sav'd, who meditate their noble flight From a bad world, to Wisdom's lofty height, Just touching at this inn, for short repast, Then speed their journey forward to its last. This the sole path? Another path there lies, The plain man's path, without proud Science wise. Who they, which traverse this deluder's bound? A busy scene, all thought or action round. Her lovers, whom her specious beauty warms, Who grasp, in vision, Truth's immortal charms, Vain of the glory of a false embrace: Fierce syllogistic tribes, a wrangling race, Bards rapt beyond the moon on Fancy's wings, And mighty masters of the vocal strings: Those who on labour'd speeches waste their oil, Those who in crabbed calculations toil, Who measure earth, who climb the starry road, And human fates by heav'nly signs forebode, Pleasure's philosophers, Lyceum's pride, Disdainful soaring up to heights untry'd. All who in learned trifles spin their wit, Or comment on the works by triflers writ. Who are yon active females, like in face To the lewd harlots, in the nether space, Vile agents of voluptuous Sin? The same. Admitted here? Ev'n here, eternal shame! They boast some rarer less ignoble spoils, Art, wit, and reason, tangled in their toils. And Fancy, with th'Opinions in her rear, Enjoys these studious walks, no stranger here: Where wild hypothesis, and learn'd romance Too oft lead up the philosophic dance. Still these ingenious heads alas! retain Delusion's dose, still the vile dregs remain Of ignorance with madding folly join'd, And a foul heart pollutes th'embellish'd mind. Nor will presumption from their souls recede, Nor will they from one vicious plague be freed, 'Till, weary of these vanities, they've found Th'exalted way to Truth's enlighten'd ground, Quaff'd her cathartic, and all cleans'd within, By that strong energy, from pride and sin, Are heal'd and sav'd. But loit'ring here they spend Life's precious hours in thinking to no end: From science up to science let them rise, And arrogate the swelling style of wise, Their wisdom's folly, impotent and blind, Which cures not one distemper of the mind. Enough. Discover now the faithful road, Which mounts us to the joys of Truth's abode. Survey this solitary waste, which rears Nor bush nor herb, nor cottage there appears. At distance see yon strait and lonely gate (No crowds at the forbidding entrance wait) Its avenue a rugged rocky soil, Travell'd with painful step and tedious toil. Beyond the wicket, tow'ring in the skies See Difficulty's cragged mountain rise, Narrow and sharp th'ascent; each edge a brink, Whence to vast depth dire precipices sink. Is that the way to Wisdom? Dreadful way! The landskip frowns with danger and dismay. Yet higher still, around the mountain's brow Winds yon huge rock, whose steep smooth sides allow No track. Its top two sister figures grace, Health's rosy habit glowing in their face. With arms protended o'er the verge they lean, The promptitude of friendship in their mien. The pow'rs of Continence and Patience, there Station'd by Wisdom, her commission bear To rouze the spirit of her fainting son Thus far advanc'd, and urge and urge him on. Courage! they call, the coward's sloth disdain, Yet, yet awhile, the noble toil sustain: A lovely path soon opens to your sight. But ah! how climb'd that rock's bare slipp'ry height? These generous guides, who Virtue's course befriend, In succour of her pilgrim, swift descend, Draw up their trembling charge; then, smiling, greet With kind command to rest his weary feet, With their own force his panting breast they arm, And with their own intrepid spirit warm: Next, plight their guidance in his future way To Wisdom, and in rapt'rous view display The blissful road (there it invites your eyes) How smooth and easy to the foot it lies, Through beauteous land, from all annoyance clear, Of thorny evil and perplexing fear. The third court, or the virtuous life.Yon lofty grove's delicious bow'rs to gain, You cross th'expanse of this enamell'd plain; A meadow with eternal beauty bright, Beneath a purer heav'n, o'erflow'd with light. Full in the center of the plain, behold A court far-flaming with its wall of gold And gate of diamond, where the righteous rest; This clime their home, the country of the blest: Here all the Virtues dwell, communion sweet! With Happiness, who rules the peaceful seat. In station at th'effulgent portal, see A beauteous form of mildest majesty. Her eyes how piercing! how sedate her mien! Mature in life, her countenance serene: Spirit and solid thought each feature shows, And her plain robe with state unstudy'd flows. She stands upon a cube of marble, fix'd As the firm rock, two lovely nymphs betwixt, Her daughters, copies of her looks and air, Here candid Truth, and sweet Persuasion there: She, she is Wisdom. In her stedfast eye Behold th'oppressive type of certainty: Certain her way, and permanent the deed Of gift substantial to her friends decreed. She gives the confidence erect and clear, She gives magnanimous contempt of fear, And bids th'invulnerable mind to know Her safety from the future shafts of woe. O treasure, richer than the sea or land! But why without the walls her destin'd stand? There standing, she presents her potent bowl, Divine cathartic, which restores the soul. This asks a comment. In some dire disease, Machaon's skill first purges off the lees: Then clear and strong the purple current flows, And life renew'd in every member glows: But if the patient all controul despise, Just victim of his stubborn will he dies. So Wisdom, by her rules, with healing art Expells Delusion's mischiefs from the heart; Blindness, and error, and high-boasting pride, Intemp'rance, lust, fierce wrath's impetuous tide, Hydropic avarice, all the plagues behind Which in the first mad court oppress'd the mind. Thus purg'd, her pupil thro' the gate she brings, The Virtues hail their guest, the guest enraptur'd sings. Behold the spotless band, celestial charms! Scene that with awe chastises whom it warms: No harlotry, no paint, no gay excess, But beauty unaffected as their dress. See Knowledge grasping a refulgent star, See Fortitude in panoply of war: Justice her equal scale aloft displays, And rights both human and divine she weighs. There Moderation, all the pleasures bound In brazen chains her dreaded feet surround. There bounteous Liberality expands To want, to worth, her ever-loaded hands. The florid hue of Temperance, her side Adorn'd by Health, a nymph in blooming pride. Lo, soft-ey'd Meekness holds a curbing rein, Anger's high-mettled spirit to restrain: While Moral Order tunes her golden lyre, And white-rob'd Probity compleats the choir. O fairest of all fair! O blissful state! What hopes sublime our ravish'd soul dilate! Substantial hopes, if by the doctrine taught, The fashion'd manners are to habit wrought. Yes, 'tis resolv'd. We'll every nerve employ. Live, then, restor'd; and reap the promis'd joy. But whither do the Virtues lead their trust? To Happiness, rewarder of the just. Look upward to the hill beyond the grove, A sovereign pile extends its front above: Stately and strong, the lofty castle stands, Its boundless prospect all the courts commands. Within the porch, high on a jasper throne, Th'Imperial Mother by her form is known; Bright as the morn, when smiling on the hills Earth, air, and sea with vernal joy she fills. Rich without lavish cost her vest behold In colours of the sky, and fring'd with gold: A tiar, wreath'd with every flow'r that blows Of liveliest tints, around her temples glows: Eternal bloom her snowy temples binds, Fearless of burning suns and blasting winds. Now, with a crown of wond'rous pow'r, her hand (Assistant, round her, all the Virtues stand) Adorns her hero, honourable meed Of conquests won by many a valiant deed. What conquests? Formidable beasts subdu'd: Lab'ring he fought, he routed, he pursu'd. Once, a weak prey, beneath their force he cowr'd, O'erthrown, and worry'd, and well-nigh devour'd: Till rouz'd from his inglorious sloth, possest With generous ardour kindling in his breast, Lord of himself, the victor now constrains Those hostile monsters in his pow'rful chains. Explain those savage beasts at war with man. Error and Ignorance, which head the van, Heart-gnawing Grief, and loud-lamenting Woe, Incontinence, a wild-destroying foe, Rapacious Avarice; cruel numbers more: O'er all he triumphs now, their slave before. O great atchievements! more illustrious far These triumphs, than the bloody wreaths of war. But, say; what salutary pow'r is shed By the fair crown, which decks the hero's head? Most beatific. For possessing this He lives, rich owner of man's proper bliss: Bliss independent or on wealth or pow'r, Fame, birth, or beauty, or voluptuous hour. His hope's divorc'd from all exterior things, Within himself the fount of pleasure springs; Springs ever in the self-approving breast, And his own honest heart's a constant feast. Where, next, his steps? He measures back his way, Conducted by the Virtues, to survey His first abode. The giddy crowd, below, Wasting their wretched span in crime, they show; How in the whirl of passions they are tost, And, shipwreck'd on the lurking shelves, are lost: Here fierce Ambition haling in her chain The mighty, there a despicable train Impure in Lust's inglorious fetter bound, And slaves of Avarice rooting up the ground: Thralls of Vain-glory, thralls of swelling Pride, Unnumber'd fools, unnumber'd plagues beside. All-pow'rless they to burst the galling band, To spring aloft, and reach yon happy land, Entangled, impotent the way to find, The clear instruction blotted from their mind Which the Good Genius gave; Guilt's gloomy fears Becloud their suns and sadden all their years. I stand convinc'd, but yet perplex'd in thought Why to review a well-known scene he's brought. Scene rudely knowh. Uncertain and confus'd, His judgment by illusions was abus'd. His evil was not evil, nor his good Aught else but vanity misunderstood. Confounding good and evil, like the throng, His life, like theirs, was action always wrong. Enlighten'd now in the true bliss of man, He shapes his alter'd course by Wisdom's plan: And, blest himself, beholds with weeping eyes The madding world an hospital of sighs. This retrospection ended, where succeeds His course? Where'er his wise volition leads. Where'er it leads, safety attends him still: Not safer, should he on Apollo's hill, Among the Nymphs, among the vocal Pow'rs, Dwell in the Sanctum of Corycian bow'rs: Honour'd by all, the friend of human kind, Belov'd physician of the sin-sick mind; Not Esculapius more, whose pow'r to save Redeems his patient from the yawning grave. But never more shall his old restless foes Awake his fears, nor trouble his repose? Never. In righteous habitude inur'd, From Passion's baneful anarchy secur'd, In each enticing scene, each instant hard, That sovereign antidote his mind will guard: Like him, who, of some virtuous drug possest, Grasps the fell viper coil'd within her nest, Hears her dire hissings, sees her terrors rise, And, unappall'd, destruction's tooth defies. Yon troops in motion from the mount explain, Various to view; for there a goodly train, With garlands crown'd, advance with comely pace, Noble their port, and in each tranquil face Joy sparkles: others, a bare-headed throng, Batter'd and gash'd, drag their slow steps along, Captives of some strange female crew. The crown'd, Long seeking, safe arriv'd at Wisdom's bound, Exult in her imparted grace. Apostates. The rest, Those on whom Wisdom, unprevailing, prest Her healing aid; rejected from her care, In evil plight their wicked days they wear: Those too, who Difficulty's hill had gain'd, There basely stopp'd, by dastard sloth detain'd: Apostate now, in thorny wilds they rove, Pursuing furies scourge the caitiff drove; Sorrows which gnaw, remorseful Thoughts which tear, Blindness of mind, and heart-oppressing Fear, With all the contumelious rout of Shame, And every ill, and every hateful name. Relaps'd to Lewdness, and her sensual Queen, Unblushing at themselves, but drunk with spleen, Wisdom's high worth their canker'd tongues dispraise, Revile her children, and blaspheme her ways. Deluded wretches, (thus their madness cries) Dull mopes, weak dupes of philosophic lies, Uncomforted, unjoyous, and unblest, Lost from the pleasures here at large possest. What pleasures boast they? Pleasures of the stews, Pleasures which Riot's frantic bowls infuse. These high fruition their gross souls repute, And man's chief good to sink into a brute. But who that lovely bevy, blithe and gay, So smoothly gliding down the hilly way? The distinction between Opinion and Knowledge.Those are th'Opinions, who have guided right The unexperienc'd to the plain of light: Returning, new adventurers to bring, The blessings of the last-arriv'd they sing. Why ingress yielded to their favour'd ward Among the Virtues, to themselves debarr'd? Opinion's foot is never never found Where Knowledge dwells, 'tis interdicted ground, At Wisdom's gate th'Opinions must resign Their charge, those limits their employ confine. Thus trading barks, skill'd in the wat'ry road, To distant climes convey their precious load, Then turn their prow, light bounding o'er the main, And with new traffic store their keels again. Thus far is clear. But yet untold remains What the Good Genius to the crowd ordains, Just on the verge of life. The instructions of the Genius.He bids them hold A spirit with erected courage bold. Never (he calls) on Fortune's faith rely, Nor grasp her dubious gifts as property. Let not her smile transport, her frown dismay, Nor praise, nor blame, nor wonder at her sway Which reason never guides: 'tis fortune still, Capricious chance and arbitrary will, Bad bankers, vain of treasure not their own, With foolish rapture hug the trusted loan: Impatient, when the pow'rful bond demands Its unremember'd cov'nant from their hands. Unlike to such, without a sigh restore What Fortune lends: anon she'll lavish more: Repenting of her bounty snatch away, Yea seize your patrimonial fund for prey. Embrace her proffer'd boon, but instant rise, Spring upward, and secure a lasting prize, The gift which Wisdom to her sons divides; Knowledge, whose beam the doubting judgment guides, Scatters the sensual fog, and clear to view Distinguishes false int'rest from the true. Flee, flee to this, with unabating pace, Nor parly for a moment at the place Where Pleasure and her Harlots tempt, nor rest But at False Wisdom's inn, a transient guest: For short refection, at her table sit, And taste what science may your palate hit: Then wing your journey forward, till you reach True Wisdom, aed imbibe the truths she'll teach. Such is th'advice the friendly Genius gives, He perishes who scorns, who follows lives. And thus this moral piece instructs; if aught Is mystic still, reveal your doubting thought. Thanks, generous Sire; tell, then, the transient bait, The Genius grants us at False Wisdom's gate. Natural knowledge, how far useful, and when unprofitable and hurtful.Whate'er in arts or sciences is found Of solid use, in their capacious round, These, Plato reasons, like a curbing rein, Unruly youth from devious starts restrain. Must we, solicitous our souls to save, Assistance from these previous studies crave? Necessity there's none. We'll not deny Their merit in some less utility; But they contribute, we aver, no part To heal the manners and amend the heart. An author's meaning, in a tongue unknown, May glimmer thro' translation in our own: Yet masters of his language, we might gain Some trivial purposes by tedious pain. So in the sciences, tho', rudely taught, We may attain the little that we ought; Yet, accurately known they might convey More light now wholly useless in its way. But Virtue may be reach'd, thro' all her rules, Without the curious subtleties of schools. How! not the learn'd excel the common shoal, In pow'rful aids to meliorate the soul? Blind as the crowd alas! to good and ill, Intangled by the like corrupted will, What boasts the man of letters o'er the rest? Skill'd in all tongues, of all the arts possest, What hinders but he sink into a sot, A libertine, or villain in a plot, Miser, or knave, or whatso'er you'll name Of moral lunacy and reason's shame? Scandals too rife! How, then, for living right Avail those studies, and their vaunted light Beyond the vulgar? Nothing. But disclose The cause from whence this strange appearance grows. Held by a potent charm in this retreat They dwell, content with nearness to the seat Of Virtuous Wisdom. Near, methinks, in vain: Since numbers, oft, from out the nether plain, 'Scap'd from the snares of Lewdness and Excess, Undevious to her lofty station press, Yet pass these letter'd clans. What, then, are these In moral things, advantag'd o'er the lees Of human race? in moral things, we find These duller or less tractable of mind. Decypher that. Pride, pride averts their eyes From offer'd light: in self-sufficience wise, Altho' unknowing, they presume to know: Clogg'd with that vain conceit they creep below, Nor can mount up to yon exalted bound, True Wisdom's mansion, by the humble found. Not found by these, till the vain visions spread, By False Opinion, in the learned head, Repentance scatter; and deceiv'd no more, They own th'illusion which deceiv'd before, That for True Wisdom they embrac'd her shade, And hence the healing of their souls delay'd. Strangers, these lessons, of revolving, hold Fast to your hearts, and into habit mould: To this high scope life's whole attention bend, Despise aught else as erring from your end. Do thus, or unavailing is my care, And all th'instruction dies away in air. The DROPSICAL MAN. By Mr. W. TAYLOR. A jolly, brave toper, who cou'd not forbear Tho' his life was in danger, old port and stale beer, Gave the doctors the hearing—but still wou'd drink on, Till the dropsy had swell'd him as big as a ton. The more he took physic the worse still he grew, And tapping was now the last thing he cou'd do. Affairs at this crisis, and doctors come down, He began to consider—so sent for his son. Tom, see by what courses I've shorten'd my life, I'm leaving the world ere I'm forty and five; More than probable 'tis, that in twenty-four hours, This manor, this house, and estate will be yours; My early excesses may teach you this truth, That 'tis working for death to drink hard in one's youth. Says Tom, (who's a lad of a generous spirit, And not like young rakes who 're in haste to inherit,) Sir, don't be dishearten'd; altho' it be true, Th'operation is painful, and hazardous too, 'Tis no more than what many a man has gone thro'. And then, as for years, you may yet be call'd young, Your life after this may be happy and long. Don't flatter me, Tom, was the father's reply, With a jest in his mouth and a tear in his eye; Too well by experience, my vessels, thou know'st, No sooner are tap'd, but they give up the ghost. PARADISE Regain'd. By H. T. I Seek not for Paradise with curious eye In Asiatic climes, where Tigris' wave, Mix'd with Euphrates in tumultuous joy, Doth the broad plains of Babylonia lave. II 'Tis gone with all its charms; and like a dream, Like Babylon itself, is swept away; Bestow one tear upon the mournful theme, But let it not thy gentle heart dismay. III For know where-ever love and virtue guide, They lead us to a state of heav'nly bliss, Where joys unknown to guilt and shame preside, And pleasures unalloy'd each hour increase. IV Behold that grove, whose waving boughs admit, Thro' the live colonade, the fruitful hill, A moving prospect with fat herds replete, Whose lowing voices all the valley fill. V There, thro' the spiry grass where glides the brook, (By yon tall poplar which erects its head Above the verdure of the neighb'ring oak,) And gently murmurs o'er th'adjoining mead; VI Philander and Cleora, happy pair, Taste the cool breezes of the gentle wind; Their breasts from guilt, their looks are free from care, Sure index of a calm contented mind. VII 'Tis here in virtuous lore the studious fair Informs her babes, nor scorns herself t'improve, While in his smile she lives, whose pleasing care Dispenses knowledge from the lips of love. VIII No wild desires can spread their poison here, No discontent their peaceful hours attend; False joys, nor flatt'ring hopes, nor servile fear, Their gentle minds with jarring passions rend. IX Here oft in pleasing solitude they rove, Recounting o'er the deeds of former days; With inward joy their well-spent time approve, And feel a recompence beyond all praise. X Or in sweet converse thro' the grove, or near The fountain's brink, or where the arbour's shade Beats back the heat, fair Virtue's voice they hear, More musical by sweet digressions made. XI With calm dependence ev'ry good they taste, Yet feel their neighbours' wants with kind regret, Nor cheer themselves alone, (a mean repast!) But deal forth blessings round their happy seat. XII 'Tis to such virtue, that the pow'r supreme The choicest of his blessings hath design'd, And shed them plenteous over ev'ry clime, The calm delights of an untainted mind. XIII Ere yet the sad effects of foolish pride, And mean ambition still employ'd in strife, And luxury did o'er the world preside, Deprav'd the taste, and pall'd the joys of life. XIV For such the Spring, in richest mantle clad, Pours forth her beauties thro' the gay parterre; And Autumn's various bosom is o'erspread With all the blushing fruits that crown the year. XV Such Summer tempts, in golden beams array'd, Which o'er the fields in borrow'd lustre glow, To meditate beneath the cooling shade Their happy state, and whence their blessings flow. XVI E'en rugged Winter varies but their joy, Painting the cheek with fresh vermilion-hue; And those rough frosts which softer frames annoy With vig'rous health their slack'ning nerves renew. XVII From the dark bosom of the dappled Morn To Phœbus shining with meridian light, Or when mild Ev'ning does the sky adorn, Or the pale moon rides thro' the spangled night. XVIII The varying scenes in ev'ry virtuous soul Each pleasing change with various pleasures bless, Raise cheerful hopes, and anxious fears controul, And form a Paradise of inward peace. To the Right Hon. Sir Robert Walpole. By the Honourable Mr. D? ? Quod censet amiculus, ut si Cæcus iter monstrare velit. ? Hor. Tho' strength of genius, by experience taught, Gives thee to sound the depth of human thought, To trace the various workings of the mind, And rule the secret springs that rule mankind; Rare gift! yet, Walpole, wilt thou condescend To listen, if thy unexperienc'd friend Can aught of use impart, tho' void of skill, And raise attention by sincere good will: For friendship sometimes want of parts supplies, The heart may furnish what the head denies. As, when the rapid Rhine o'er swelling tides, To grace old Ocean's coast, in triumph rides, Tho' rich in source, he drains a thousand springs, Nor scorns the tribute each small riv'let brings: So thou shalt hence absorb each feeble ray, Each dawn of meaning in thy brighter day; Shalt like, or where thou canst not like, excuse, Since no mean interest shall prophane the Muse; No malice wrapt in truth's disguise offend, No flattery taint the freedom of a friend. When first a generous mind surveys the great, And views the crowds that on their fortune wait, Pleas'd with the shew, (though little understood,) He only seeks the pow'r, to do the good: Thinks, till he tries, 'tis godlike to dispose, And gratitude still springs when bounty flows; That ev'ry grant sincere affection wins, And where our wants have end, our love begins. But they who long the paths of state have trod, Learn from the clamours of the murm'ring crowd, Which cramm'd, yet craving, still their gates besiege, 'Tis easier far to give, than to oblige. This of thy conduct seems the nicest part, The chief perfection of the statesman's art, To give to fair assent a fairer face, Or soften a refusal into grace. But few there are, that can be freely kind, Or know to fix the favours on the mind; Hence some whene'er they wou'd oblige, offend, And while they make the fortune, lose the friend: Still give unthank'd; still squander, not bestow; For great men want not what to give, but how. The race of men that follow courts, 'tis true, Think all they get, and more than all, their due; Still ask, but ne'er consult their own deserts, And measure by their interest, not their parts. From this mistake so many men we see But ill become the thing they wish to be: Hence discontent and fresh demands arise, More power, more favour in the great man's eyes All feel a want, tho' none the cause suspects, But hate their patron for their own defects. Such none can please, but who reforms their hearts, And when he gives them places, gives them parts. As these o'erprize their worth, so sure the great May sell their favours at too dear a rate. When merit pines while clamour is prefer'd, And long attachment waits among the herd; When no distinction, where distinction's due, Marks from the many the superior few; When strong cabal constrains them to be just, And makes them give at last, because they must; What hopes that men of real worth should prize What neither friendship gives, nor merit buys. The man who justly o'er the whole presides, His well-weigh'd choice with wise affection guides: Knows when to stop with grace, and when advance, Nor gives from importunity, or chance; But thinks how little gratitude is ow'd, When favours are extorted, not bestow'd. When safe on shore ourselves, we see the crowd Surround the great, importunate and loud, Thro' such a tumult 'tis no easy task, To drive the man of real worth to ask; Surrounded thus, and giddy with the shew, 'Tis hard for great men rightly to bestow; From hence so few are skill'd in either case, To ask with dignity, or give with grace. Sometimes the great, seduc'd by love of parts, Consult our genius, but neglect our hearts; Pleas'd with the glittering sparks that genius flings, They lift us tow'ring on the eagle's wings: Mark out the flights by which themselves begun, And teach our dazzled eyes to bear the sun, 'Till we forget the hand that makes us great, And grow to envy, not to emulate. To emulate a generous warmth implies, To reach the virtues that make great men rise; But envy wears a mean malignant face, And aims not at their virtues, but their place. Such to oblige, how vain is the pretence! When ev'ry favour is a fresh offence, By which superior power is still imply'd, And while it helps the fortune, hurts the pride. Slight is the hate neglect or hardships breed, But those who hate from envy, hate indeed. Since so perplex'd the choice, whom shall we trust? Methinks, I hear thee cry, the brave, the just; The man by no mean fears or hopes controul'd, Who serves thee from affection, not for gold! We love the honest, and esteem the brave, Despise the coxcomb, but detest the knave. No shew of parts the truly wise seduce, To think that knaves can be of real use. The man who contradicts the public voice, And strives to dignify a worthless choice, Attempts a task that on the choice reflects, And lends us light to point out new defects. One worthless man that gains what he pretends, Disgusts a thousand unpretending friends; And since no art can make a counter pass, Or add the weight of gold to mimic brass, When princes to bad ore their image join, They more debase the stamp than raise the coin; Be thine that care, true merit to reward, And gain that good; nor will the task be hard. Souls found alike so quick by nature blend, An honest man is more than half thy friend. Him no mere views, no haste to rise, shall sway, Thy choice to sully, or thy trust betray. Ambition here shall at due distance stand, Nor is wit dangerous in an honest hand: Besides, if failings at the bottom lie, He views those failings with a lover's eye. Tho' small his genius, let him do his best, Our wishes and belief supply the rest: Let others barter servile faith for gold, His friendship is not to be bought or sold. Fierce opposition he unmov'd shall face, Modest in favour, daring in disgrace; To share thy adverse fate alone pretend, In power a servant, out of power a friend. Here pour thy favours in an ample flood, Indulge thy boundless thirst of doing good. Nor think that good alone to him confin'd; Such to oblige is to oblige mankind. If thus thy mighty master's steps thou trace, The brave to cherish, and the good to grace, Long shalt thou stand from rage and faction free, And teach us long to love the king and thee; Or fall a victim, dangerous to the foe, And make him tremble when he strikes the blow; While honour, gratitude, affection join, To deck thy close, and brighten thy decline. Illustrious doom! the great when thus displac'd, With friendship guarded, and with virtue grac'd, In aweful ruin, like Rome's senate, fall The prey and worship of the wond'ring Gaul. No doubt to genius some reward is due, (Excluding that were satirizing you): But yet believe thy undesigning friend, When truth and genius for thy choice contend, Tho' both have weight, when in the balance cast, Let probity be first, and parts the last. On these foundations if thou dar'st be great, And check the growth of folly and deceit, When party rage shall drop thro' length of days, And calumny be ripen'd into praise, Then future times shall to thy worth allow That fame, which envy wou'd call flattery now. Thus far my zeal, tho' for the task unfit, Has pointed out the rocks where others split: By that inspir'd, tho' stranger to the Nine, And negligent of any fame but thine, I take that friendly, but superfluous part, That acts from nature what I teach from art. To a Lady on a Landscape of her Drawing. By Mr. PARRAT. Behold the magic of Theresa's hand! A new creation blooms at her command. Touch'd into life the vivid colours glow, Catch the warm stream, and quicken as they flow. The ravish'd sight the pleasing landscape fills, Here sink the vallies, and there rise the hills. Not with more horror nods bleak Calpe's height, Than here the pictur'd rock astounds the sight. Not Thames more devious-winding leaves his source, Than here the wand'ring rivers shape their course. Obliquely lab'ring runs the gurgling rill; Still murm'ring runs, or seems to murmur still. An aged oak, with hoary moss o'erspread, Here lifts aloft its venerable head; There overshadowing hangs a sacred wood, And nods inverted in the neighb'ring flood. Each tree as in its native forest shoots, And blushing bends with Autumn's golden fruits. Thy pencil lends the rose a lovelier hue, And gives the lily fairer to our view. Here fruits and flow'rs adorn the varied year, And paradise with all its sweets is here. There stooping to its fall a tow'r appears, With tempests shaken, and a weight of years. The daisied meadow, and the woodland green, In order rise, and fill the various scene. Some parts, in light magnificently dress'd, Obtrusive enter, and stand all confess'd; Whilst others decently in shades are thrown, And by concealing make their beauties known. Alternate thus, and mutual is their aid, The lights owe half their lustre to the shade. So the bright fires that light the milky way, Lost and extinguish'd in the solar ray; In the sun's absence pour a flood of light, And borrow all their brightness from the night. To cheat our eyes how well dost thou contrive! Each object here seems real and alive. Not more resembling life the figures stand, Form'd by Lysippus, or by Phidias' hand. Unnumber'd beauties in the piece unite; Rush on the eye, and crowd upon the sight. At once our wonder and delight you raise, We view with pleasure, and with rapture praise. ODE to Cupid on Valentine's Day. By the Same. Come thou rosy-dimpled boy, Source of ev'ry heart-felt joy, Leave the blissful bow'rs awhile, Paphos and the Cyprian isle: Visit Britain's rocky shore, Britons too thy pow'r adore. Britons hardy, bold, and free, Own thy laws, and yield to thee. Source of ev'ry heart-felt joy, Come thou rosy-dimpled boy. Haste to Sylvia, haste away, This is thine, and Hymen's day; Bid her thy soft bondage wear, Bid her for Love's rites prepare. Let the nymphs with many a flow'r Deck the sacred nuptial bow'r. Thither lead the lovely fair, And let Hymen too be there. This is thine, and Hymen's day, Haste to Sylvia, haste away. Only while we love we live, Love alone can pleasure give; Pomp and pow'r, and tinsel state, Those false pageants of the great, Crowns and scepters, envied things, And the pride of Eastern kings, Are but childish empty toys, When compar'd to Love's sweet joys. Love alone can pleasure give, Only while we love, we live. To the Honourable and Reverend F. C. In frolick's hour, ere serious thought had birth, There was a time, my dear C?s, when The Muse would take me on her airy wing And waft to views romantic; there present Some motley vision, shade and sun: the cliff O'erhanging, sparkling brooks, and ruins grey; Bad me meanders trace, and catch the form Of varying clouds, and rainbows learn to paint. Sometimes ambition, brushing by, wou'd twitch My mantle, and with winning look sublime Allure to follow. What tho' steep the track, Her mountain's top wou'd overpay when climb'd The scaler's toil; her temple there was fine, And lovely thence the prospects. She cou'd tell Where laurels grew, whence many a wreath antique; But more advis'd to shun the barren twig, (What is immortal verdure without fruit?) And woo some thriving art: her num'rous mines Were open to the searcher's skill and pains. Caught by th'harangue, heart beat, and flutt'ring pulse Sounded irregular marches to be gone— What, pause a moment when Ambition calls? No, the blood gallops to the distant goal, And throbs to reach it. Let the lame sit still. When Fortune gentle, at the hill's verge extreme, Array'd in decent garb, but somewhat thin, Smiling approach'd, and what occasion ask'd, Of climbing? She already provident Had cater'd well, if stomach cou'd digest Her viands, and a palate not too nice. Unfit she said, for perilous attempt, That manly limb requir'd, and sinews tough. She took, and lay'd me in a vale remote, Amid the gloomy scene of fir and yew, On poppy beds, where Morpheus strew'd the ground: Obscurity her curtain round me drew, And syren Sloth a dull quietus sung. Sithence no fairy lights, no quick'ning ray, Nor stir of pulse, nor objects to entice Abroad the spirits; but the cloyster'd heart Sits squat at home, like pagod in a nitch Obscure, or grandees with nod-watching eye, And folded arms, in presence of the throne, Turk, or Indostan.—Cities, forums, courts And prating sanhedrims, and drumming wars, Affect no more than stories told to bed Lethargic, which at intervals the sick Hears and forgets, and wakes to doze again. Instead of converse and variety, The same trite round, the same stale silent scene: Such are thy comforts, blessed Solitude! But Innocence is there, but Peace all kind, And simple Quiet with her downy couch, Meads lowing, tune of birds, and lapse of streams, And Saunter, with a book, and warbling Muse, In praise of hawthorns.—Life's whole business this! Is it to bask i'th' sun, if so, a snail Were happy crawling on a southern wall. Why sits Content upon a cottage-sill At eventide, and blesseth the coarse meal In sooty corner? why sweet slumbers wait Th'hard pallet? not because from haunt remote Sequester'd in a dingle's bushy lap: 'Tis labour makes the peasant's sav'ry fare, And works out his repose: for ease must ask The leave of diligence to be enjoy'd. Oh! listen not to that enchantress Ease With seeming smile, her palatable cup By standing grows insipid; and beware The bottom, for there's poison in the lees. What health impair'd, and crowds inactive maim'd? What daily martyrs to her sluggish cause! Less strict devoir the Russ and Persian claim Despotic; and as subjects long inur'd To servile burden, grow supine and tame, So fares it with our sov'reign and her train. What tho' with lure fallacious she pretend From worldly bondage to set free, what gain Her votaries? What avails from iron chains Exempt, if rosy fetters bind as fast. Bestir, and answer your creation's end. Think we that man with vig'rous pow'r endow'd, And room to stretch, was destin'd to sit still? Sluggards are nature's rebels, slight her laws, Nor live up to the terms on which they hold Their vital lease. Laborious terms and hard, But such the tenure of our earthly state! Riches and fame are Industry's reward; The nimble runner courses Fortune down, And then he banquets, for she feeds the bold. Think what you owe your country, what yourself. If splendor charm not, yet avoid the scorn That treads on lowly stations. Think of some Assiduous booby mounting o'er your head, And thence with saucy grandeur looking down: Think of (Reflection's stab!) the pitying friend With shoulder shrug'd, and sorry. Think that Time Has golden minutes, if discreetly seiz'd: And if some sad example, indolent, To warn and scare be wanting—think of me. To the Reverend T? T?, D. D. —French pow'r, and weak allies, and war, and want— No more of that, my friend; you touch a string That hurts my ear. All politics apart, Except a gen'rous wish, a glowing prayer For British welfare, commerce, glory, peace. Give party to the winds: it is a word, A phantom sound, by which the cunning great Whistle to their dependents: a decoy To gull th'unwary, where the master stands Encouraging his minions, his train'd birds, Fed and caress'd their species to betray. See with what hollow blandishment and art They lead the winged captive to the snare! Fools! that in open æther might have soar'd, Free as the air they cut; sip'd purest rills, Din'd with the Thames, or bath'd in crystal lakes. We wear no badges, no dependence own: Who truly loves thee, dearest Liberty, A silken fetter will uneasy sit. Heav'n knows it is not Insolence that speaks! The tribute of respect to greatness due Not the brib'd sycophant more willing pays. Still, still as much of party be retain'd, As principle requires, and sense directs: Else our vain bark, without a rudder, floats The scorn and pastime of each veering gale. This gentle ev'ning let the sun descend Untroubled, while it paints your ambient hills With faded lustre, and a sweet farewel. Here is our seat: that castle opposite, Proud of its woody brow, adorns the scene. Dictate, O vers'd in books, and just of taste, Dictate the pleasing theme of our discourse. Shall we trace Science from her Eastern home Chaldæan; or the banks of Nile, where Thebes, Nursing her daughter arts, majestic stood, And pour'd forth knowledge from an hundred gates? There first the marble learn'd to mimic life, The pillar'd temple rose, and pyramids, Whose undecaying grandeur laughs at Time; Birth-place of letters, where the sun was shewn His radiant way, and heav'ns were taught to roll. There too the Muses tun'd their earliest lyre, Warbling soft numbers to Serapis' ear; 'Till chac'd by tyrants, or a milder clime Inviting, they remov'd with pilgrim harps, And all their band of harmony to Greece. As when a flock of linnets, if perchance Deliver'd from the falcon's talon, fly With trembling wing to cover, and renew Their notes; tell ev'ry bush of their escape, And thrill their merry thanks to Liberty. The tuneful tribe, pleas'd with their new abode, Polish'd the rude inhabitants, whence tales Of list'ning woods, and rocks that danc'd to sound. Hear the full chorus lifting hymns to Jove! Linus and Orpheus catch the strain, and all The raptur'd audience utter loud applause. A song, believe me, was no trifle then: Weighty the Muse's task, and wide her sway: Her's was religion, the resounding fanes Echo'd her language; polity was her's, And the world bow'd to legislative verse. As states increas'd, and governments were form'd, Her aid less useful, she retir'd to grots And shady bow'rs, content to teach and please. Under her laurel frequent bards repos'd; Voluble Pindar troll'd his rapid song, Or Sappho breath'd her spirited complaint: Here the stage buskin, there the lyric choir, And Homer's epic trumpet. Happy Greece, Bless'd in her offspring! Seat of eloquence, Of arts and reason; patriot-virtue's seat! Did the sun thither dart uncommon rays! Did some presiding genius hover o'er That animated soil with brooding wings! The sad reverse might start a gentle tear— Go, search in Athens for herself, enquire Where are her orators, her sages now: Her arsenal overturn'd, her walls in dust, But far less ruin'd than her soul decay'd. The stone inscrib'd to Socrates, debas'd To prop a reeling cot: Minerva's shrine Possess'd by those who never heard her name. Upon the mount where old Musæus sung, Sits the grim turban'd captain, and exacts Harsh tribute; on the spot where Plato taught His heav'nly strains sublime, a stupid Turk Is preaching ignorance and Mahomet. Turn next to Rome: is that the clime, the place, Where once, as Fame reports, Augustus liv'd? What magic has transform'd her, shrunk her nerves? A wither'd laurel, and a mould'ring arch!— Cou'd the pure crimson tide, the noblest blood That ever flow'd, to such a puddle turn? She ends, like her long Appian, in a marsh; Or Jordan's river pouring his clear urn Into the black Asphaltus' slimy lap. Patrons of wit, and victors of mankind, Bards, warriors, worthies (revolution strange) Are pimps and fidlers, mountebanks and monks. In Tully's beehive, magazine of sweets, The lazy drones are buzzing or asleep. But we forgive the living for the dead; Indebted more to Rome than we can pay. Of a long dearth prophetic, she lay'd in A feast for ages.—O thou banquet nice, Where the soul riots with secure excess! What felt delight! what pleasing useful hours Repeated owe we to her letter'd sons! We by their favour Tiber's walks enjoy, Their temples trace, and share their noble games; Enter the crowded theatre at will, Go to the forum, hear the consul plead, Are present in the thund'ring Capitol When Tully speaks; at softer hours attend Harmonious Virgil to his Mantuan farm, Or Baian; and with happy Horace talk In myrtle groves by Teverone's cascade. Hail, precious pages! that amuse and teach, Exalt the genius, and improve the breast. Ye sage historians all your stores unfold, Reach your clear steady mirror—in that glass The forms of good and ill are well portray'd. But chiefly thou, divine Philosophy, Shed thy bless'd influence; with thy train appear Of graces mild, far be the Stoic boast, The Cynic's snarl, and churlish pedantry. Bright visitant, if not too high my wish, Come in the lovely dress you wore, a guest At Plato's table, or at Tusculum, The Roman feasting his selected friends. Tamer of pride! at thy serene rebuke See crouching insolence, spleen, and revenge Before thy shining taper disappear. Tutor of human life, auspicious guide, Whose faithful clue unravels ev'ry Muse, Whose conduct smooths the roughest paths; whose voice Controuls each storm, and bids the roar be still: O condescend to gild my darksome roof: Let me know thee—the Delphic oracle Is then obey'd—and I shall know myself. VACATION. By ? Esq; Hence sage, mysterious Law, That sitt'st with rugged brow, and crabbed look O'er thy black-letter'd book, And the night-watching student strik'st with awe; Away with thy dull train, Slow-pac'd Advice, Surmise, and squint-ey'd Doubt Dwell with the noisy rout Of busy men, 'mid cities and throng'd halls, Where Clamour ceaseless bawls, And enmity and strife thy state sustain. But on me thy blessings pour, Sweet Vacation. Thee, of yore, In all her youth and beauty's prime, Summer bore to aged Time, As he one sunny morn beheld her Tending a field of corn: the elder There 'mid poppies red and blue, Unsuspected nearer drew, And, with softly-sliding pace Hast'ning to a stol'n embrace, Fill'd her with thee; and joy and mirth Hung on thy auspicious birth. Come, sweet goddess; full of play, Ever unconfin'd and gay, Bring the leisure-hours with thee Leading on the Graces three Dancing; nor let aught detain The Holidays, a smiling train. Whose fair brows let Peace serene Crown with olive-branches green. Bring too Health with ruddy cheek, Lively air, and count'nance sleek, Attended, as she's wont to be, With all her jolly company Of exercises, chace, and flight, Active strength, and cunning sleight, Nimble feats, and playful bouts, Leaps of joy, and cheerful shouts, Tricks and pranks and sports and games Such as youthful Fancy frames. And, O kind goddess, add to these Cheerful Content, and placid Ease; Not her who fondly sitteth near, Dull Indolence in elbow'd chair; But Ease who aids th'harmonious Nine, Tuning their instruments divine, And without whom, in lofty strain, Phœbus' client tries in vain To raise his feeble voice above The crowd, and catch the ear of Jove. And do thou, Vacation, deign To let me pass among thy train; So may I thy vot'ry true, All thy flow'ry paths pursue, Pleased still with thee to meet In some friendly rural seat; Where I gladsome oft' survey Nature in her best array, Woods and lawns and lakes between, Fields of corn and hedges green, Fallow grounds of tawny hue, Distant hills, and mountains blue; On whose ridge far off appears A wood (the growth of many years) Of aweful oak, or gloomy pine, Above th'horizon's level line Rising black: such those of old Where British druids wont to hold Solemn assemblies, and to keep Their rites, unfolding myst'ries deep, Such that fam'd Dodona's grove, Sacred to prophetic Jove. Oft' I admire the verdant steep, Spotted white with many a sheep, While, in pastures rich below Among the grazing cattle, slow Moves the bull with heavy tread Hanging down his lumpish head, And the proud steed neigheth oft' Shaking his wanton mane aloft. Or, traversing the wood about, The jingling packhorse-bells remote I hear, amid the noontide stillness, Sing thro' the air with brassy shrillness; What time the waggon's cumbrous load Grates along the grav'lly road: There onward, dress'd in homely guise, Some unregarded maiden hies, Unless by chance a trav'lling 'squire, Of base intent and foul desire, Stops to insnare, with speech beguiling, Sweet innocence and beauty smiling. Nor fail I joyful to partake The lively sports of country wake, Where many a lad and many a lass Foot it on the close-trod grass. There nimble Marian of the green Matchless in the jig is seen, Allow'd beyond compare by all, The beauty of the rustic ball: While, the tripping damsels near, Stands a lout with waggish leer; He, if Marian chance to shew Her taper leg and stocking blue, Winks and nods and laughs aloud, Among the merry-making crowd, Utt'ring forth, in aukward jeer, Words unmeet for virgin's ear. Soon as ev'ning clouds have shed Their wat'ry store on earth's soft bed, And thro' their flowing mantles thin, Clear azure spots of sky are seen, I quit some oak's close-cover'd bow'r To taste the boon of new-fall'n show'r, To pace the corn-field's grassy edge Close by a fresh-blown sweet-bri'r hedge; While at every green leaf's end Pearly drops of rain depend, And an earthy fragrance 'round Rises from the moisten'd ground. Sudden a sun-beam darting out, Brightens the landskip all about, With yellow light the grove o'erspreads, And tips with gold the haycocks' heads: Then, as mine eye is eastward led, Some fair castle rears its head, Whose height the country round commands, Well known mark to distant lands, There the windows glowing bright Blaze from afar with ruddy light Borrow'd from clouds of scarlet dye, Just as the sun hath left the sky. But if chill Eurus cut the air With keener wing, I then repair To park or woodland, shelter meet, Near some noble's ancient seat, Where long winding walks are seen Stately oaks and elms between, Whose arms promiscuous form above High over-arch'd a green alcove; While the hoarse-voic'd hungry rook Near her stick-built nest doth croak, Waving on the topmost bough; And the master stag below Bellows loud with savage roar, Stalking all his hinds before. Thus musing, night with even pace Steals on, o'ershad'wing nature's face; While the bat with dusky wings Flutters round in giddy rings, And the buzzing chaffers come Close by mine ear with solemn hum. Homeward now my steps I guide Some rising grassy bank beside, Studded thick with sparks of light Issuing from many a glow-worm bright; While village-cur with minute bark Alarms the pilf'rer in the dark, Save what light the stars convey, Cluster'd in the milky way, Or scatter'd numberless on high Twinkling all o'er the boundless sky. Then within doors let me meet The viol touch'd by finger neat, Or, soft symphonies among Wrap me in the sacred song, Attun'd by Handel's matchless skill, While Attention mute and still Fixes all my soul to hear The voice harmonious, sweet and clear. Nor let smooth-tongu'd Converse fail, With many a well-devised tale, And stories link'd, to twist a chain That may awhile old Time detain, And make him rest upon his scythe Pleas'd to see the hours so blithe: While, with sweet attractive grace, The beauteous house-wife of the place Wins the heart of ev'ry guest By courteous deeds, and all contest Which shall readiest homage shew To such sov'reign sweetness due. These delights, Vacation, give, And I with thee will chuse to live. To a LADY very handsome, but too fond of Dress. By the Same. Prythee why so fantastick and vain! What charms can the toilet supply? Why so studious admirers to gain? Need beauty lay traps for the eye? Because that thy breast is so fair, Must thy tucker be still setting right? And canst thou not laughing forbear, Because that thy teeth are so white? Shall sovereign beauty descend To act so ignoble a part? Whole hours at the looking-glass spend, A slave to the dictates of art? And cannot thy heart be at rest Unless thou excellest each fair In trinkets and trumpery dress'd? Is not that a superfluous care? Vain, idle attempt! to pretend The lilly with whiteness to deck! Does the rich solitaire recommend The delicate turn of thy neck? The glossy bright hue of thy hair Can powder or jewels adorn? Can perfumes or vermilions compare With the breath or the blush of the morn? When, embarrass'd with baubles and toys, Thou'rt set out so enormously fine, Over-doing thy purpose destroys, And to please thou hast too much design: Little know'st thou, how beauty beguiles, How alluring the innocent eye; What sweetness in natural smiles, And what charms in simplicity lye. Thee Nature with beauty has clad, With genuine ornaments dress'd; Nor can Art an embellishment add To set off what already is best: Be it thine, self-accomplish'd to reign; Bid the toilet be far set apart, And dismiss with an honest disdain That impertinent Abigail, Art. ANACREON. Ode III. Translated by the Same. In the dead of the night, when with labour oppress'd All mortals enjoy the calm blessing of rest, Cupid knock'd at my door, I awoke with the noise, And “who is it (I call'd) that my sleep thus destroys? “You need not be frighten'd, he answered mild, “Let me in; I'm a little unfortunate child; “'Tis a dark rainy night; and I'm wet to the skin; “And my way I have lost; and do, pray, let me in.” I was mov'd with compassion; and striking a light, I open'd the door; when a boy stood in sight, Who had wings on his shoulders: the rain from him dripp'd, With a bow and with arrows too he was equipp'd. I stirr'd up my fire, and close by its side I set him down by me: with napkins I dried, I chaf'd him all over, kept out the cold air, And I wrung with my hands the wet out of his hair. He from wet and from cold was no sooner at ease, But taking his bow up, he said, “If you please “We will try it; I would by experiment know “If the wet hath not damag'd the string of my bow.” Forthwith from his quiver an arrow he drew, To the string he apply'd it, and twang went the yew; The arrow was gone; in my bosom it center'd: No sting of a hornet more sharp ever enter'd. Away skipp'd the urchin, as brisk as a bee, And laughing, “I wish you much joy friend, quoth he: “My bow is undamag'd, for true went the dart; “But you will have trouble enough with your heart.” An Imitation of Horace, Ode II. Book III. By Mr. Titley, to Dr. Bentley. Angustam amice, &amp;c. He that would great in science grow, By whom bright Virtue is ador'd, At first must be content to know An humble roof, an homely board. With want, and rigid college laws Let him inur'd betimes, comply; Firm to religion's sacred cause, The learned combat let him try; Let him her envied praises tell, And all his eloquence disclose The fierce endeavours to repel, And still the tumult of her foes. Him early form'd, and season'd young Subtle opposers soon will fear, And tremble at his artful tongue, Like Parthians at the Roman spear. Grim death, th'inevitable lot Which fools and cowards strive to fly, Is with a noble pleasure sought By him who dares for truth to die. With purest lustre of her own Exalted Virtue ever shines, Nor as the vulgar smile or frown Advances now and now declines. A glorious and immortal prize, She on her hardy son bestows, She shews him heaven, and bids him rise, Tho' pain, and toil, and death oppose: With lab'ring flight he wings th'obstructed way, Leaving both common souls and common clay. A Reply to a Copy of Verses made in Imitation of Ode II. Book III. of Horace. And sent by Mr. Titley to Dr. Bentley. By Dr. BENTLEY. Angustam amice pauperiem pati, &amp;c. Who strives to mount Parnassus' hill, And thence poetick laurels bring, Must first acquire due force, and skill, Must fly with swans, or eagle's wing. Who nature's treasures wou'd explore, Her mysteries and arcana know, Must high, as lofty Newton soar, Must stoop, as delving Woodward low. Who studies ancient laws and rites, Tongues, arts, and arms, and history, Must drudge like Selden days and nights, And in the endless labour die. Who travels in religious jars, (Truth mixt with error, shade with rays,) Like Whiston wanting pyx or stars, In ocean wide or sinks or strays. But grant our heroe's hope long toil And comprehensive genius crown, All sciences, all arts his spoil, Yet what reward, or what renown? Envy, innate in vulgar souls, Envy steps in and stops his rise; Envy, with poison'd tarnish fouls His lustre, and his worth decries. He lives inglorious, or in want, To college and old books confin'd; Instead of learn'd he's call'd pedant, Dunces advanc'd, he's left behind: Yet left content, a genuine stoic he, Great without patron, rich without South-sea. Inscription on a Grotto of Shells at Crux-Easton, the Work of Nine young Ladies. By Mr. POPE. Here shunning idleness at once and praise, This radiant pile nine rural sisters raise; The glitt'ring emblem of each spotless dame, Clear as her soul, and shining as her frame; Beauty which Nature only can impart, And such a polish as disgraces Art; But Fate dispos'd them in this humble sort, And hid in desarts what wou'd charm a court. VERSES occasioned by seeing a Grotto built by Nine Sisters. The attribution of this poem is questionable.So much this building entertains my sight, Nought but the builders can give more delight: In them the master-piece of Nature's shown, In this I see Art's master-piece in stone. O! Nature, Nature, thou hast conquer'd Art; She charms the sight alone, but you the heart. N. H. An Excuse for Inconstancy, 1737. By the Rev. Dr. LISLE. When Phœbus's beams are withdrawn from our sight, We admire his fair sister, the regent of night; Tho' languid her beauty, tho' feeble her ray, Yet still she's akin to the God of the day. When Susan, like Cynthia, has finish'd her reign, Then Charlotte, like Phœbus, shall shine out again. As Catholic bigots fall humble before The pictures of those whom in heart they adore, Which tho' known to be nothing but canvas and paint, Yet are said to enliven their zeal to the saint; So to Susan I bow, charming Charlotte, for she Has just beauty enough to remind me of thee. Inconstant and faithless in love's the pretence On which you arraign me: pray hear my defence. Such censures as these to my credit redound; I acknowledge, and thank a good appetite for't, When ven'son and claret are not to be found, I can make a good meal upon mutton and port. Tho' The seat of the honourable R. H?t. Highclear's so fine that a prince would not scorn it, Tho' nature and taste have combin'd to adorn it, Yet the artist that owns it wou'd think it severe, Were a law made to keep him there all round the year, How enrag'd wou'd the rector of Wotton, the author's parish in the isle of Wight. Boscoville look, If the king should enjoin him to read but one book! And how would his audience their fortune bemoan, If he gave them no sermons but what were his own! 'Tis variety only makes appetite last, And by changing our dishes we quicken our taste. To VENUS. A Rant, 1732. Set to Music by Dr. HAYES, By the same. Recitative. O Goddess most rever'd above, Bright parent of almighty Love, Whose pow'r th'immortal Gods confess, Hear and approve my fond address: In melting softness I thy doves outvie, Then teach me like thy swans to sing and fly; So I thy vot'ry will for ever be; My song, my life I'll consecrate to thee. Air. Give me numbers strong and sweet, Glowing language, pointed wit; Words that might a Vestal move, And melt a frozen heart to love. Bid, bid thy blind boy All his vigour employ; On his wings wou'd I soar up to same: 'Tis but just, if he scorch My breast with his torch, In my wit too he kindle a flame. Recitative. Trophies to Chastity let others raise, In notes as cold as the dull thing they praise, To rage like mine more sprightly themes belong; Gay youth inspires, and beauty claims my song; Me all the little Loves and Graces own; For I was born to worship them alone. Air. Tell not me the joys that wait On him that's rich, on him that's great: Wealth and wisdom I despise: Cares surround the rich and wise. No, no,—let love, let life be mine: Bring me women, bring me wine: Speed the dancing hours away, And mind not what the grave ones say; Speed, and gild 'em as they fly With love and freedom, wit and joy: Bus'ness, title, pomp, and state, Give 'em to the fools I hate. The Power of MUSIC. A SONG. Imitated from the Spanish. By the same. Set to Music by Dr. HAYES. I When Orpheus went down to the regions below, Which Men are forbidden to see, He tun'd up his lyre, as old histories shew, To set his Eurydice free. II All hell was astonish'd a person so wise Shou'd rashly endanger his life, And venture so far,—but how vast their surprise! When they heard that he came for his wife. III To find out a punishment due to his fault, Old Pluto had puzzled his brain, But hell had not torments sufficient, he thought, —So he gave him his wife back again. IV But pity succeeding found place in his heart, And pleas'd with his playing so well, He took her again in reward of his art; Such merit had music in hell! LETTER from Smyrna to his Sisters at Crux-Easton, 1733. By the Same. The hero who to Smyrna bay From Easton, Hants, pursued his way, Who travers'd seas, and hills and vales, To fright his sisters with his tales, Sing heavenly muse; for what befel Thou saw'st, and only thou can'st tell. Say first (but one thing I premise, I'll not be chid for telling lies; Besides, my grannum us'd to say I always had a knack that way, So, if the love of truth be in ye, Read Strabo, Diodorus, Pliny— But like some authors I could name, Wrapt in myself I lose my theme.) Say first, those very rocks we spy'd, But left 'em on the starboard side, Where Juno urg'd the Trojan's fate. Shield us, ye Gods, from female hate! Then how precarious was the doom Of Cæsar's line, and mighty Rome, Snatch'd from the very jaws of ruin, And sav'd, poor Dido. Die, for thy undoing, What saw we on Sicilian ground? (A soil in ancient verse renown'd) The self-same spot, or Virgil ly'd, On which the good Anchises dy'd; The fields where Ceres' daughter sported, And where the pretty Cyclops courted. The nymph hard-hearted as the rocks, Refus'd the monster, scorn'd his flocks, And took a shepherd in his stead, With nought but love and worth to plead: An instance of a generous mind That does much honour to your kind, But in an age of fables grew, So possibly it may'nt be true. While on the summit Ætna glows, His shivering sides are chill'd with snows. Beneath, the painted landskip charms; Here infant Spring in Winter's arms Wantons secure; in youthful pride Stands Summer laughing by her side; Ev'n Autumn's yellow robes appear, And one gay scene discloses all the year. Hence to rude Cerigo we came, Known once by Cytherea's name; When Ocean first the goddess bore, She rose on this distinguish'd shore. Here first the happy Paris stopp'd, When Helen from her lord elop'd. With pleas'd reflection I survey'd Each secret grott, each conscious shade; Envy'd his choice, approv'd his flame, And fondly wish'd my lot the same. O were the cause reviv'd again! For charming Queensbury liv'd not then, The radiant fruit, had she been there, Would scarce have fallen to Venus' share; Saturnia's self had wav'd her claim, And modest Pallas blush'd for shame; All had been right: the Phrygian swain Had sigh'd for her, but sigh'd in vain; The fair Œnone joy'd to find, The pains she felt repaid in kind; No rape reveng'd, no room for strife, Atrides might have kept his wife, Old Troy in peace and plenty smil'd— But the Iliad. best poem had been spoil'd. How did my heart with joy run o'er, When to the fam'd Cecropian shore, Wafted by gentle breezes, we Came gliding thro' the smooth still sea! While backward rov'd my busy thought On deeds in distant ages wrought; On tyrants gloriously withstood; On seas distain'd with Persian blood; On trophies rais'd o'er hills of slain In Marathon's unrival'd plain. Then, as around I cast my eye, And view'd the pleasing prospect nigh, The land for arms and arts renown'd, Where wit was honour'd, poets crown'd; Whose manners and whose rules refin'd Our souls, and civiliz'd mankind; Or (yet a loftier pitch to raise Our wonder, and compleat its praise) The land that Socrates. Plato's master bore— How did my heart with joy run o'er! Now coasting on the eastern side, We peep'd where Peneus rolls his tide: Where Arethusa came t'appease The shepherd that had lost his bees, And led him to Cyrene's grott; 'Tis a long tale, and matters not. Dryden will tell you all that past; See Virgil's Georgics, book the last. I speak on't, but to let you know This grott still stands in statu quo; Of which if any doubts remain, I've proof, as follows, clear and plain. Here, sisters, we such honours met! Such honour I shall ne'er forget. The Goddess (no uncommon case) Proud, I suppose, to shew her place, Or piqu'd perhaps at your renown, Sent Boreas to invite us down; And he so press'd it, that we us'd Some pains to get ourselves excus'd. My brother shipmates, all in haste Declar'd, that shells were not their taste; And I had At Crux-Easton. somewhere seen, you know, A finer grott than she could shew. Hence let the Muse to Delos roam, Or Nio, fam'd for Homer's tomb; To Naxos, known in ancient time For Bacchus' love, for Theseus' crime. Can she the Lesbian vine forget Whence Horace reinforc'd his wit? Where the fam'd harp Arion strung Nor play'd more sweet than Sapho sung? Could the old bards revive again, How would they mourn th'inverted scene! Scarce with the barren waste acquainted, They once so beautifully painted. And here, 'twixt friends, I needs must say, But let it go no farther, pray, These sung-up, cry'd up countries are Displeasing, rugged, black, and bare; And all I've yet beheld or known Serve only to endear my own. The matters I shall next disclose, 'Tis likely may be wrapp'd in prose; But verse methought would suit these better, Besides, it lengthens out my letter. Read then, dear girls, with kind regard, What comes so far, what comes so hard; And to our mother too make known, How travelling has improv'd her son. Let not malicious critics join Pope's homespun rhimes in rank with mine, Form'd on that very spot of earth, Where Homer's self receiv'd his birth; Add, as I said, t'enhance their worth, The pains they cost in bringing forth; While his, as all mankind agrees, Tho' wrote with care, are wrote with ease. Part of a Letter to my Sisters at Crux-Easton, wrote from Cairo in Egypt, August 1734. By the Same. While you, my dear girls, in your paradise stray, Diverting with innocent freedom the day, I wander alone in a barbarous land, Half bak'd by the sun, half blind by the sand. Then your wood too and grotto so swim in my sight, They give me no respite by day nor by night; No sooner asleep but I'm dreaming of you; I am just wak'd from one,—wou'd to God it were true. Methought I was now a fine gentleman grown, And had got, Lord knows how, an estate of my own. Good-bye to plain Tom, I was rais'd a peg higher; Some call'd me his worship, and others the squire. 'Twas a place, I remember, exactly like Easton, A scene for an emperor's fancy to feast on. There I built a fine house with great cost and great care, (Your la'ships have form'd many such in the air) Not of stucco, nor brick, but as good Portland stone As Kent wou'd desire to be working upon. The apartments not small, nor monstrously great, But chiefly for use, and a little for state; So begilt, and becarv'd, and with ornaments grac'd, That ev'ry one said, I'd an excellent taste. Here I liv'd like a king, never hoarded my pelf, Kept a coach for my sisters, a nag for myself, With something that's good when our Highclear friends come, And, spite of 'squire Herbert, a fire in each room. A canal made for profit as well as for pleasure, That's about, let me see, two acres in measure; Both the eye to delight, and the table to crown With a jack, or a perch, when my uncles come down. An exceeding great wood, that's been set a great while, In length near a league, and in breadth near a mile. There ev'ry dear girl her bright genius displays, In a thousand fine whimsies a thousand fine ways. O how charming the walks to my fancy appear! What a number of temples and grottos are here! My soul was transported to such an extreme, That I leap'd up in raptures,—when lo! 'twas a dream; Then vexing I chid the impertinent day For driving so sweet a delusion away. Thus spectres arise, as by nurse-maids we're told, And hie to the place where they buried their gold: There hov'ring around until morning remain; Then sadly return to their torments again. LETTER from Marseilles to my Sisters at Crux-Easton, May 1735. By the Same. SCENE, the stuay at Crux-Easton. Molly and Fanny are sitting at work; enter to them Harriot in a passion. Harriot. Lord! sister, here's the butcher come, And not one word from brother Tom; The punctual spark, that made his boast He'd write by ev'ry other post! That ever I was so absurd To take a man upon his word! Quoth Frances, Child, I wonder much You cou'd expect him to keep touch: 'Tis so, my dear, with all mankind; When out of sight you're out of mind, Think you he'd to his sisters write? Was ever girl so unpolite! Some fair Italian stands possess'd, And reigns sole mistress in his breast; To her he dedicates his time, And fawns in prose, or sighs in rhyme. She'll give him tokens of her love, Perhaps not easy to remove; Such as will make him large amends For loss of sisters, and of friends. Cries Harriot, when he comes to France, I hope in God he'll learn to dance, And leave his aukward habits there, I'm sure he has enough to spare. O cou'd he leave his faults, saith Fanny, And bring the good alone, if any, Poor brother Tom, he'd grow so light, The wind might rob us of him quite! Of habits he may well get clear; Ill humours are the faults I fear, For in my life I ne'er saw yet A creature half so passionate. Good heav'ns! how did he rave and tear, On my not going you know where; I scarcely yet have got my dread off: I thought he'd bite my sister's head off. 'Tween him and Jenny what a clatter About a fig, a mighty matter! I cou'd recount a thousand more, But scandal's what I most abhor. Molly, who long had patient sate, And heard in silence all their chat, Observing how they spoke with rancour, Took up my cause, for which I thank her. What eloquence was then display'd, The charming things that Molly said, Perhaps it suits not me to tell; But faith! she spoke extremely well. She first, with much ado, put on A prudish face, then thus begun. Heyday! quoth she, you let your tongue Run on most strangely, right or wrong. 'Tis what I never can connive at; Besides, consider whom you drive at; A person of establish'd credit, Nobody better, tho' I said it. In all that's good, so tried and known, Why, girls, he's quite a proverb grown, His worth no mortal dares dispute: Then he's your brother too to boot. At this she made a moment's pause, Then with a sigh resum'd the cause. Alas! my dears, you little know A sailor's toil, a trav'ler's woe; Perhaps this very hour he strays A lonely wretch thro' desart ways; Or shipwreck'd on a foreign strand, He falls beneath some ruffian's hand: Or on the naked rock he lies, And pinch'd by famine wastes and dies. Can you this hated brother see Floating, the sport of wind and sea? Can you his feeble accents hear, Tho' but in thought, nor drop a tear? He faintly strives, his hopes are fled, The billows booming o'er his head; He mounts upon the waves again, He calls on us, but calls in vain; To death preserves his friendship true, And mutters out a kind adieu. See now he rises to our sight, Now sinks in everlasting night. Here Fanny's colour rose and fell, And Harriot's throat began to swell: One sidled to the window quite, Pretending some unusual sight, The other left the room outright; While Molly laugh'd, her ends obtain'd, To think how artfully she feign'd. The History of Porsenna, King of Russia, IN TWO BOOKS. By the Same. Arva, beata Petamus arva, divites et insulas. Hor. Epod. 16. BOOK I. In Russia's frozen clime some ages since There dwelt, historians say, a worthy prince, Who to his people's good confin'd his care, And fix'd the basis of his empire there; Inlarg'd their trade, the lib'ral arts improv'd, Made nations happy, and himself belov'd; To all the neighb'ring states a terror grown, The dear delight, and glory of his own. Not like those kings who vainly seek renown From countries ruin'd, and from battles won; Those mighty Nimrods, who mean laws despise, Call murder but a princely exercise, And if one bloodless sun shou'd steal away, Cry out with Titus, they have lost a day; Who, to be more than men, themselves debase Beneath the brute, their Maker's form deface, Raising their titles by their God's disgrace. Like fame to bold Erostratus we give, Who scorn'd by less than sacrilege to live; On holy ruins rais'd a lasting name, And in the temple's fire diffus'd his shame. Far diff'rent praises, and a brighter fame, The virtues of the young Porsenna claim; For by that name the Russian king was known, And sure a nobler ne'er adorn'd the throne. In war he knew the deathful sword to wield, And sought the thickest dangers of the field, A bold commander; but, the storm o'erblown, He seem'd as he were made for peace alone; Then was the golden age again restor'd, Nor less his justice honour'd than his sword. All needless pomp, and outward grandeur spar'd, The deeds that grac'd him were his only guard; No private views beneath a borrow'd name; His and the publick interest were the same. In wealth and pleasure let the subject live, But virtue is the king's prerogative; Porsenna there without a rival stood, And wou'd maintain his right of doing good. Nor did his person less attraction wear, Such majesty and sweetness mingled there; Heav'n with uncommon art the clay refin'd, A proper mansion for so fair a mind; Each look, each action bore peculiar grace, And love itself was painted on his face. In peaceful time he suffer'd not his mind To rust in sloth, tho' much to peace inclin'd; Nor wanton in the lap of pleasure lay, And lost to glory loiter'd life away; But active rising ere the prime of day, Thro' woods and lonely desarts lov'd to stray; With hounds and horns to wake the furious bear, Or rouze the tawny lion from his laire; To rid the forest of the savage brood, And whet his courage for his country's good. One day, as he pursued the dang'rous sport, Attended by the nobles of his court, It chanced a beast of more than common speed Sprang from the brake, and thro' the desart fled. The ardent prince impetuous as the wind Rush'd on, and left his lagging train behind. Fir'd with the chace, and full of youthful blood, O'er plains, and vales, and woodland wilds he rode, Urging his courser's speed, nor thought the day How wasted, nor how intricate the way; Nor, till the night in dusky clouds came on, Restrain'd his pace, or found himself alone. Missing his train, he strove to measure back The road he came, but cou'd not find the track; Still turning to the place he left before, And only lab'ring to be lost the more. The bugle horn, which o'er his shoulders hung, So loud he winded, that the forest rung; In vain, no voice but Echo from the ground, And vocal woods, made mock'ry of the sound. And now the gath'ring clouds began to spread O'er the dun face of night a deeper shade; And the hoarse thunder growling from afar, With herald voice proclaim'd th'approaching war; Silence awhile ensued,—then by degrees A hollow wind came mutt'ring thro' the trees. Sudden the full-fraught sky discharg'd its store, Of rain and rattling hail a mingled show'r; The active lightning ran along the ground; The fiery bolts by fits were hurl'd around, And the wide forests trembled at the sound. Amazement seiz'd the prince;—where cou'd he fly? No guide to lead, no friendly cottage nigh. Pensive and unresolv'd awhile he stood, Beneath the scanty covert of the wood; But drove from thence soon sallied forth again, As chance directed, on the dreary plain; Constrain'd his melancholy way to take Thro' many a loathsome bog, and thorny brake, Caught in the thicket, flound'ring in the lake. Wet with the storm, and wearied with the way, By hunger pinch'd, himself to beasts a prey; Nor wine to cheer his heart, nor fire to burn, Nor place to rest, nor prospect to return. Drooping and spiritless, at life's despair, He bade it pass, not worth his farther care; When suddenly he spied a distant light, That faintly twinkled thro' the gloom of night, And his heart leap'd for joy, and bless'd the welcome fight. Oft-times he doubted, it appear'd so far, And hung so high, 'twas nothing but a star, Or kindled vapour wand'ring thro' the sky, But still press'd on his steed, still kept it in his eye; Till, much fatigue, and many dangers past, At a huge mountain he arriv'd at last. There lighting from his horse, on hands and knees Grop'd out the darksome road, by slow degrees, Crawling or clamb'ring o'er the rugged way; The thunder rolls above, the flames around him play. Joyful at length he gain'd the steepy height, And found the rift whence sprang the friendly light. And here he stopp'd to rest his wearied feet, And weigh the perils he had still to meet; Unsheath'd his trusty sword, and dealt his eyes With caution round him to prevent surprize; Then summon'd all the forces of his mind, And ent'ring boldly cast his fears behind: Resolv'd to push his way, whate'er withstood, Or perish bravely as a monarch shou'd. While he the wonders of the place survey'd, And thro' the various cells at random stray'd, In a dark corner of the cave he view'd Somewhat, that in the shape of woman stood; But more deform'd than dreams can represent The midnight hag, or poet's fancy paint The Lapland witch, when she her broom bestrides, And scatters storms and tempests as she rides. She look'd as nature made her to disgrace Her kind, and cast a blot on all the race; Her shrivel'd skin with yellow spots besmear'd Like mouldy records seem'd; her eyes were blear'd; Her feeble limbs with age and palsy shook; Bent was her body, haggard was her look. From the dark nook outcrept the filthy crone, And propp'd upon her crutch came tott'ring on. The prince in civil guise approach'd the dame, Told her his piteous case, and whence he came, And till Aurora shou'd the shades expel, Implor'd a lodging in her friendly cell. Mortal, whoe'er thou art, the fiend began, And as she spake a deadly horror ran Thro' all his frame; his cheeks the blood forsook, Chatter'd his teeth, his knees together struck. Whoe'er thou art, that with presumption rude Dar'st on her sacred privacy intrude, And without licence in our court appear, Know, thou'rt the first that ever enter'd here. But since thou plead'st excuse, thou'rt hither brought More by thy fortune than thy own default, Thy crime, tho' great, an easy pardon finds, For mercy ever dwells in royal minds; And wou'd you learn from whose indulgent hand You live, and in whose aweful presence stand, Know farther, thro' yon wide extended plains Great Eolus the king of tempests reigns, And in this lofty palace makes abode, Well suited to his state, and worthy of the God. The various elements his empire own, And pay their humble homage at his throne; And hither all the storms and clouds resort, Proud to increase the splendor of his court. His queen am I, from whom the beauteous race Of winds arose, sweet fruit of our embrace! She scarce had ended, when, with wild uproar, And horrid din, her sons impetuous pour Around the cave; came rushing in amain Lybs, Eurus, Boreas, all the boist'rous train; And close behind them on a whirlwind rode In clouded majesty the blust'ring God. Their locks a thousand ways were blown about; Their cheeks like full-blown bladders strutted out; Their boasting talk was of the feats th'had done, Of trees uprooted, and of towns o'erthrown; And when they kindly turn'd them to accost The prince, they almost pierc'd him with their frost. The gaping hag in fix'd attention stood, And at the close of ev'ry tale cried—good, Blessing with outstretch'd arms each darling son, In due proportion to the mischief done. And where, said she, does little Zephyr stray? Know ye, my sons, your brother's rout to-day? In what bold deeds does he his hours employ? Grant heav'n no evil has befall'n my boy! Ne'er was he known to linger thus before. Scarce had she spoke, when at the cavern door Came lightly tripping in a form more fair Than the young poet's fond ideas are, When fir'd with love, he tries his utmost art To paint the beauteous tyrant of his heart. A satin vest his slender shape confin'd, Embroider'd o'er with flow'rs of ev'ry kind, Flora's own work, when first the goddess strove To win the little wanderer to her love. Of burnish'd silver were his sandals made, Silver his buskins, and with gems o'erlaid; A saffron-colour'd robe behind him flow'd, And added grace and grandeur as he trod. His wings than lillies whiter to behold, Sprinkled with azure spots, and streak'd with gold; So thin their form, and of so light a kind, That they for ever danc'd, and flutter'd in the wind. Around his temples with becoming air, In wanton ringlets curl'd his auburn hair, And o'er his shoulders negligently spread; A wreath of fragrant roses crown'd his head. Such his attire, but O! no pen can trace, No words can shew the beauties of his face; So kind! so winning! so divinely fair! Eternal youth and pleasure flourish there; There all the little loves and graces meet, And ev'ry thing that's soft, and ev'ry thing that's sweet. Thou vagrant, cried the dame in angry tone, Where could'st thou loiter thus so long alone? Little thou car'st what anxious thoughts molest, What pangs are lab'ring in a mother's breast. Well do you shew your duty by your haste, For thou of all my sons are always last; A child less fondled wou'd have fled more fast. Sure 'tis a curse on mothers, doom'd to mourn, Where best they love, the least and worst return. My dear mamma, the gentle youth replied, And made a low obeisance, cease to chide, Nor wound me with your words, for well you know, Your Zephyr bears a part in all your woe; How great must be his sorrow then to learn That he himself's the cause of your concern! Nor had I loiter'd thus had I been free, But the fair princess of Felicity, Intreated me to make some short delay, And ask'd by her who cou'd refuse to stay? Surrounded by the damsels of her court She sought the shady grove, her lov'd resort; Fresh rose the grass, the flow'rs were mix'd between, Like rich embroid'ry on a ground of green, And in the midst, protected by the shade, A crystal stream in wild meanders play'd; While in its banks, the trembling leaves among, A thousand little birds in concert sung. Close by a mount with fragrant shrubs o'ergrown, On a cool mossy couch she laid her down; Her air, her posture, all conspir'd to please; Her head, upon her snowy arm at ease Reclin'd, a studied carelessness express'd; Loose lay her robe, and naked heav'd her breast. Eager I flew to that delightful place, And pour'd a show'r of kisses on her face; Now hover'd o'er her neck, her breast, her arms, Like bees o'er flow'rs, and tasted all her charms; And then her lips, and then her cheeks I tried, And fann'd, and wanton'd round on ev'ry side. O Zephyr, cried the fair, thou charming boy, Thy presence only can create me joy; To me thou art beyond expression dear, Nor can I quit the place while thou art here. Excuse my weakness, madam, when I swear Such gentle words join'd with so soft an air, Pronounc'd so sweetly from a mouth so fair, Quite ravish'd all my sense, nor did I know How long I staid; or when, or where to go. Mean while the damsels debonnair and gay, Prattled around, and laugh'd the time away: These in soft notes address'd the ravish'd ear, And warbled out so sweet, 'twas heav'n to hear; And those in rings, beneath the greenwood shade, Danc'd to the melody their fellows made. Some studious of themselves, employ'd their care In weaving flow'ry wreaths to deck their hair; While others to some fav'rite plant convey'd Refreshing show'rs, and cheer'd its drooping head. A joy so general spread thro' all the place, Such satisfaction dwelt on ev'ry face, The nymphs so kind, so lovely look'd the queen, That never eye beheld a sweeter scene. Porsenna, like a statue fix'd appear'd, And, wrapp'd in silent wonder, gaz'd and heard; Much he admir'd the speech, the speaker more, And dwelt on ev'ry word, and griev'd to find it o'er. O gentle youth, he cried, proceed to tell, In what fair country does this princess dwell; What regions unexplor'd, what hidden coast Can so much goodness, so much beauty boast? To whom the winged god with gracious look, Numberless sweets diffusing while he spoke, Thus answer'd kind—These happy gardens lie Far hence remov'd, beneath a milder sky; Their name—The kingdom of Felicity. Sweet scenes of endless bliss, enchanted ground, A soil for ever sought, but seldom found; Tho' in the search all human kind in vain Weary their wits, and waste their lives in pain. In diff'rent parties, diff'rent paths they tread, As reason guides them, or as follies lead; These wrangling for the place they ne'er shall see, Debating those, if such a place there be; But not the wisest, nor the best can say Where lies the point, or mark the certain way. Some few, by Fortune favour'd for her sport, Have sail'd in sight of this delightful port; In thought already seiz'd the bless'd abodes, And in their fond delirium rank'd with gods. Fruitless attempt! all avenues are kept By dreadful foes, sentry that never slept. Here fell Detraction darts her pois'nous breath Fraught with a thousand stings, and scatters death; Sharp-sighted Envy there maintains her post, And shakes her flaming brand, and stalks around the coast. These on the helpless bark their fury pour, Plunge in the waves, or dash against the shore; Teach wretched mortals they were doom'd to mourn, And ne'er must rest but in the silent urn. But say, young monarch, for what name you bear Your mien, your dress, your person, all declare; And tho' I seldom fan the frozen north, Yet I have heard of brave Porsenna's worth. My brother Boreas thro' the world has flown, Swelling his breath to spread forth your renown; Say, wou'd you choose to visit this retreat, And view the world where all these wonders meet? Wish you some friend o'er that tempestuous sea To bear you safe! behold that friend in me. My active wings shall all their force employ, And nimbly waft you to the realms of joy; As once, to gratify the god of Love, I bore fair Psyche to the Cyprian grove; Or as Jove's bird, descending from on high, Snatch'd the young Trojan trembling to the sky. There perfect bliss thou may'st for ever share, 'Scap'd from the busy world, and all its care; There in the lovely princess shalt thou find A mistress ever blooming, ever kind. All ecstacy on air Porsenna trod, And to his bosom strain'd the little god; With grateful sentiments his heart o'erflow'd, And in the warmest words millions of thanks bestow'd. When Æolus in surly humour broke Their strict embrace, and thus abruptly spoke. Enough of compliment; I hate the sport Of meanless words; this is no human court; Where plain and honest are discarded quite, For the more modish title of polite; Where in soft speeches hypocrites impart The venom'd ills that lurk beneath the heart; In friendship's holy guise their guilt improve, And kindly kill with specious shew of love. For us,—my subjects are not us'd to wait, And waste their hours to hear a mortal prate; They must abroad before the rising sun, And hie 'em to the seas: there's mischief to be done. Excuse my plainness, Sir, but business stands, And we have storms and shipwrecks on our hands. He ended frowning, and the noisy rout, Each to his several cell went puffing out. But Zephyr, far more courteous than the rest, To his own bow'r convey'd the royal guest; There on a bed of roses neatly laid, Beneath the fragrance of a myrtle shade, His limbs to needful rest the prince applied, His sweet companion slumb'ring by his side. BOOK II. No sooner in her silver chariot rose The ruddy morn, than sated with repose The prince address'd his host; the God awoke, And leaping from his couch, thus kindly spoke. This early call, my lord, that chides my stay, Requires my thanks, and I with joy obey. Like you I long to reach the blissful coast, Hate the slow night, and mourn the moments lost. The bright Rosinda, loveliest of the fair That crowd the princess' court, demands my care; Ev'n now with fears and jealousies o'erborn Upbraids, and calls me cruel and forsworn. What sweet rewards on all my toils attend, Serving at once my mistress and my friend; Just to my love and to my duty too, Well paid in her, well pleas'd in pleasing you. This said, he led him to the cavern gate, And clasp'd him in his arms, and pois'd his weight; Then ballancing his body here and there, Stretch'd forth his agile wings, and launch'd in air; Swift as the fiery meteor from on high Shoots to its goal, and gleams athwart the sky. Here with quick fan his lab'ring pinions play; There glide at ease along the liquid way; Now lightly skim the plain with even flight; Now proudly soar above the mountain's height. Spiteful Detraction, whose envenom'd hate Sports with the suff'rings of the good and great, Spares not our prince, but with opprobrious sneer Arraigns him of the heinous sin of fear; That he, so tried in arms, whose very name Infus'd a secret panic where it came, Ev'n he, as high above the clouds he flew, And spied the mountains less'ning to the view, Nought round him but the wide expanded air, Helpless, abandon'd to a stripling's care, Struck with the rapid whirl, and dreadful height, Confess'd some faint alarm, some little fright. The friendly God, who instantly divin'd The terrors that possess'd his fellow's mind, To calm his troubled thoughts, and cheat the way, Describ'd the nations that beneath them lay, The name, the climate, and the soil's increase, Their arms in war, their government in peace; Shew'd their domestic arts, their foreign trade, What int'rest they pursued, what leagues they made. The sweet discourse so charm'd Porsenna's ear, That lost in joy he had no time for fear. From Scandinavia's cold inclement waste O'er wide Germania's various realms they past, And now on Albion's fields suspend their toil, And hover for awhile, and bless the soil. O'er the gay scene the prince delighted hung, And gaz'd in rapture, and forgot his tongue; Till bursting forth at length. Behold, cried he, The promis'd isle, the land I long'd to see; Those plains, those vales, and fruitful hills declare My queen, my charmer must inhabit there. Thus rav'd the monarch, and the gentle guide, Pleas'd with his error, thus in smiles replied. I must applaud, my lord, the lucky thought; Ev'n I, who know th'original, am caught, And doubt my senses, when I view the draught. The slow-ascending hill, the lofty wood That mantles o'er its brow, the silver flood Wand'ring in mazes thro' the flow'ry mead, The herd that in the plenteous pastures feed, And ev'ry object, every scene excites Fresh wonder in my soul, and fills with new delights: Dwells cheerful Plenty there, and learned Ease, And Art with Nature seems at strife to please. There Liberty, delightful goddess, reigns, Gladdens each heart, and gilds the fertile plains; There firmly seated may she ever smile, And show'r her blessings o'er her fav'rite isle! But see, the rising sun reproves our stay. He said, and to the ocean wing'd his way, Stretching his course to climates then unknown, Nations that swelter in the burning zone. There in Peruvian vales a moment staid, And smooth'd his wings beneath the citron shade; Then swift his oary pinions plied again, Cross'd the new world, and sought the Southern main; Where many a wet and weary league o'erpast, The wish'd for paradise appear'd at last. With force abated now they gently sweep O'er the smooth surface of the shining deep; The Dryads hail'd them from the distant shore, The Nereids play'd around, the Tritons swam before, While soft Favonius their arrival greets, And breathes his welcome in a thousand sweets. Nor pale disease, nor health-consuming care, Nor wrath, nor foul revenge can enter there; No vapour's foggy gloom imbrowns the sky; No tempests rage, no angry lightnings fly; But dews, and soft-refreshing airs are found, And pure ætherial azure shines around. Whate'er the sweet Sabæan soil can boast, Or Mecca's plains, or India's spicy coast; What Hybla's hills, or rich Œbalia's fields, Or flow'ry vale of fam'd Hymettus yields; Or what of old th'Hesperian orchard grac'd; All that was e'er delicious to the taste, Sweet to the smell, or lovely to the view, Collected there with added beauty grew. High-tow'ring to the heav'ns the trees are seen, Their bulk immense, their leaf for ever green; So closely interwove, the tell-tale sun Can ne'er descry the deeds beneath them done, But where by fits the sportive gales divide Their tender tops, and fan the leaves aside. Like a smooth carpet at their feet lies spread The matted grass, by bubbling fountains fed; And on each bough the feather'd choir employ Their melting notes, and nought is heard but joy. The painted flow'rs exhale a rich perfume, The fruits are mingled with eternal bloom, And Spring and Autumn hand in hand appear, Lead on the merry months, and join to cloath the year. Here, o'er the mountain's shaggy summit pour'd, From rock to rock the tumbling torrent roar'd, While beauteous Iris in the vale below Paints on the rising fumes her radiant bow. Now through the meads the mazy current stray'd, Now hid its wand'rings in the myrtle shade; Or in a thousand veins divides its store, Visits each plant, refreshes ev'ry flow'r; O'er gems and golden sands in murmurs flows, And sweetly soothes the soul, and lulls to soft repose. If hunger call, no sooner can the mind Express her will to needful food inclin'd, But in some cool recess, or op'ning glade, The seats are plac'd, the tables neatly laid, And instantly convey'd by magic hand In comely rows the costly dishes stand; Meats of all kinds that nature can impart, Prepar'd in all the nicest forms of art. A troop of sprightly nymphs array'd in green, With flow'ry chaplets crown'd, come scudding in; With fragrant blossoms these adorn the feast, Those with officious zeal attend the guest; Beneath his feet the silken carpet spread, Or sprinkle liquid odours o'er his head. Others in ruby cups with roses bound Delightful! deal the sparkling nectar round; Or weave the dance, or tune the vocal lay; The lyres resound, the merry minstrels play, Gay health, and youthful joys o'erspread the place, And swell each heart, and triumph in each face. So when embolden'd by the vernal air, The busy bees to blooming fields repair; For various use employ their chymic pow'r; One culls the snowy pounce, one sucks the flow'r; Again to diff'rent works returning home, Some Or stive, flipant. steeve the honey, some erect the comb; All for the general good in concert strive, And ev'ry soul's in motion, ev'ry limb's alive. And now descending from his flight, the God On the green turf releas'd his precious load; There, after mutual salutations past, And endless friendship vow'd, they part in haste; Zephyr impatient to behold his love, The prince in raptures wand'ring thro' the grove; Now skipping on, and singing as he went, Now stopping short to give his transports vent; With sudden gusts of happiness oppress'd, Or stands entranc'd, or raves like one possess'd; His mind afloat, his wand'ring senses quite O'ercome with charms, and frantic with delight; From scene to scene by random steps conveyed, Admires the distant views, explores the secret shade, Dwells on each spot, with eager eye devours The woods, the lawns, the buildings, and the bow'rs; New sweets, new joys at every glance arise, And ev'ry turn creates a fresh surprize. Close by the borders of a rising wood, In a green vale a crystal grotto stood; And o'er its side, beneath a beechen shade, In broken falls a silver fountain play'd. Hither, attracted by the murm'ring stream, And cool recess, the pleas'd Porsenna came, And on the tender grass reclining chose To wave his joys awhile, and take a short repose. The scene invites him, and the wanton breeze That whispers thro' the vale, the dancing trees, The warbling birds, and rills that gently creep, All join their music to prolong his sleep. The princess for her morning walk prepar'd; The female troops attend, a beauteous guard. Array'd in all her charms appear'd the fair; Tall was her stature, unconfin'd her air; Proportion deck'd her limbs, and in her face Lay love inshrin'd, lay sweet attractive grace Temp'ring the aweful beams her eyes convey'd, And like a lambent flame around her play'd. No foreign aids, by mortal ladies worn, From shells and rocks her artless charms adorn; For grant that beauty were by gems increas'd, 'Tis render'd more suspected at the least; And foul defects, that wou'd escape the sight, Start from the piece, and take a stronger light. Her chesnut hair in careless rings around Her temples wav'd, with pinks and jes'mine crown'd, And, gather'd in a silken cord behind, Curl'd to the waist, and floated in the wind; O'er these a veil of yellow gause she wore, With amaranths and gold embroider'd o'er. Her snowy neck half naked to the view Gracefully fell; a robe of purple hue Hung loosely o'er her slender shape, and tried To shade those beauties, that it cou'd not hide. The damsels of her train with mirth and song Frolick behind, and laugh and sport along. The birds proclaim their queen from ev'ry tree; The beasts run frisking thro' the groves to see; The Loves, the Pleasures, and the Graces meet In antic rounds, and dance before her feet. By whate'er fancy led, it chanc'd that day They thro' the secret valley took their way, And to the crystal grot advancing spied The prince extended by the fountain's side. He look'd as, by some skilful hand express'd, Apollo's youthful form retir'd to rest; When with the chace fatigued he quits the wood For Pindus' vale, and Aganippe's flood; There sleeps secure, his careless limbs display'd At ease, encircled by the laurel shade; Beneath his head his sheaf of arrows lie, His bow unbent hangs negligently by. The slumb'ring prince might boast an equal grace, So turn'd his limbs, so beautiful his face. Waking he started from the ground in haste, And saw the beauteous choir around him plac'd; Then, summoning his senses, ran to meet The queen, and laid him humbly at her feet. Deign, lovely princess, to behold, said he, One, who has travers'd all the world to see Those charms, and worship thy divinity: Accept thy slave, and with a gracious smile Excuse his rashness, and reward his toil. Stood motionless the fair with mute surprize, And read him over with admiring eyes; And while she stedfast gaz'd, a pleasing smart Ran thrilling thro' her veins, and reach'd her heart. Each limb she scann'd, consider'd ev'ry grace, And sagely judg'd him of the phœnix' race. An animal like this she ne'er had known, And thence concluded there could be but one; The creature too had all the phœnix' air; None but the phœnix cou'd appear so fair. The more she look'd, the more she thought it true, And call'd him by that name, to shew she knew. O handsome phœnix, for that such you are We know; your beauty does your breed declare; And I with sorrow own thro' all my coast No other bird can such perfection boast; For Nature form'd you single and alone: Alas! what pity 'tis there is but one! Were there a queen so fortunate to shew An aviary of charming birds like you, What envy wou'd her happiness create In all, who saw the glories of her state! The prince laugh'd inwardly, surpriz'd to find So strange a speech, so innocent a mind. The compliment indeed did some offence To reason, and a little wrong'd her sense; He cou'd not let it pass, but told his name, And what he was, and whence, and why he came; And hinted other things of high concern For him to mention, and for her to learn; And she 'ad a piercing wit, of wond'rous reach To comprehend whatever he cou'd teach. Thus hand in hand they to the palace walk, Pleas'd and instructed with each other's talk. Here, shou'd I tell the furniture's expence, And all the structure's vast magnificence, Describe the walls of shining saphire made, With emerald and pearl the floors inlaid, And how the vaulted canopies unfold A mimic heav'n, and flame with gems and gold; Or how Felicity regales her guest, The wit, the mirth, the music, and the feast; And on each part bestow the praises due, 'Twould tire the writer, and the reader too. My amorous tale a softer path pursues: Love and the happy pair demand my Muse. O cou'd her art in equal terms express The lives they lead, the pleasures they possess! Fortune had ne'er so plenteously before Bestow'd her gifts, nor can she lavish more. 'Tis heav'n itself, 'tis ecstacy of bliss, Uninterrupted joy, untir'd excess; Mirth following mirth the moments dance away; Love claims the night, and friendship rules the day. Their tender care no cold indiff'rence knows; No jealousies disturb their sweet repose; No sickness, no decay; but youthful grace, And constant beauty shines in either face. Benumming age may mortal charms invade, Flow'rs of a day that do but bloom and fade; Far diff'rent here, on them it only blows The lilly's white, and spreads the blushing rose; No conquest o'er those radiant eyes can boast; They like the stars shine brighter in its frost; Nor fear its rigour, nor its rule obey; All seasons are the same, and ev'ry month is May. Alas! how vain is happiness below! Man soon or late must have his share of woe; Slight are his joys, and fleeting as the wind; His griefs wound home, and leave a sting behind. His lot distinguish'd from the brute appears Less certain by his laughter than his tears; For ignorance too oft our pleasure breeds, But sorrow from the reas'ning soul proceeds. If man on earth in endless bliss cou'd be, The boon, young prince, had been bestow'd on thee. Bright shone thy stars, thy Fortune flourish'd fair, And seem'd secure beyond the reach of care, And so might still have been, but anxious thought Has dash'd thy cup, and thou must taste the draught. It so befel, as on a certain day This happy couple toy'd their time away, He ask'd how many charming hours were flown, Since on her slave her heav'n of beauty shone. Should I consult my heart, cried he, the rate Were small, a week wou'd be the utmost date: But when my mind reflects on actions past, And counts its joys, time must have fled more fast. Perhaps I might have said, three months are gone. Three months! replied the fair, three months alone! Know that three hundred years have roll'd away, Since at my feet the lovely phœnix lay. Three hundred years! re-echo'd back the prince, A whole three hundred years compleated since I landed here! O! whither then are flown My dearest friends, my subjects, and my throne? How strange, alas! how alter'd shall I find Each earthly thing, each scene I left behind! Who knows me now? on whom shall I depend To gain my rights? where shall I find a friend? My crown perhaps may grace a foreign line, A race of kings, that know not me nor mine; Who reigns may wish my death, his subjects treat My claim with scorn, and call their prince a cheat. Oh had my life been ended as begun! My destin'd stage, my race of glory run, I shou'd have died well pleas'd; my honour'd name Had liv'd, had flourish'd in the list of fame; Reflecting now my mind with horror sees The sad survey, a scene of shameful ease, The odious blot, the scandal of my race, Scarce known, and only mention'd with disgrace. The fair beheld him with impatient eye, And red with anger made this warm reply. Ungrateful man! is this the kind return My love deserves; and can you thus with scorn Reject what once you priz'd, what once you swore Surpass'd all charms, and made ev'n glory poor? What gifts have I bestow'd, what favours shewn! Made you partaker of my bed and throne; Three centuries preserv'd in youthful prime, Safe from the rage of death, and injuries of time, Weak arguments! for glory reigns above The feeble ties of gratitude and love. I urge them not, nor wou'd request your stay; The phantom glory calls, and I obey; All other virtues are regardless quite, Sunk and absorb'd in that superior light. Go then, barbarian, to thy realms return, And shew thyself unworthy my concern; Go, tell the world, your tender heart cou'd give Death to the princess, by whose care you live. At this a deadly pale her cheeks o'erspread, Cold trembling seiz'd her limbs, her spirits fled; She sunk into his arms: the prince was mov'd, Felt all her griefs, for still he greatly lov'd. He sigh'd, he wish'd he could forget his throne, Confine his thoughts, and live for her alone; But glory shot him deep, the venom'd dart Was fix'd within, and rankled at his heart; He cou'd not hide its wounds, but pin'd away Like a sick flow'r, and languish'd in decay. An age no longer like a month appears, But ev'ry month becomes a hundred years. Felicity was griev'd, and cou'd not bear A scene so chang'd, a sight of so much care. She told him with a look of cold disdain, And seeming ease, as women well can feign, He might depart at will; a milder air Wou'd mend his health; he was no pris'ner there; She kept him not, and wish'd he ne'er might find Cause to regret the place he left behind; Which once he lov'd, and where he still must own, He had at least some little pleasure known. If these prophetic words awhile destroy His peace, the former ballance it in joy. He thank'd her for her kind concern, but chose To quit the place, the rest let heav'n dispose. For Fate, on mischiefs bent, perverts the will, And first infatuates whom it means to kill. Aurora now, not, as she wont to rise, In gay attire ting'd with a thousand dies, But sober-sad in solemn state appears, Clad in a dusky veil bedew'd with tears. Thick mantling clouds beneath her chariot spread, A faded wreath hangs drooping from her head. The sick'ning sun emits a feeble ray, Half drown'd in fogs, and struggling into day. Some black event the threat'ning skies foretel. Porsenna rose to take his last farewel. A curious vest the mournful princess brought, And armour by the Lemnian artist wrought; A shining lance with secret virtue stor'd, And of resistless force a magic sword; Caparisons and gems of wond'rous price, And loaded him with gifts and good advice; But chief she gave, and what he most wou'd need, The fleetest of her stud, a flying steed. The swift Grifippo, said th'afflicted fair, (Such was the courser's name) with speed shall bear, And place you safely in your native air; Assist against the foe, with matchless might Ravage the field, and turn the doubtful fight; With care protect you till the danger cease, Your trust in war, your ornament in peace. But this, I warn, beware; whate'er shall lay To intercept your course, or tempt your stay, Quit not your saddle, nor your speed abate, Till safely landed at your palace gate. On this alone depends your weal or woe; Such is the will of Fate, and so the Gods foreshew. He in the softest terms repaid her love, And vow'd, nor age, nor absence shou'd remove His constant faith, and sure she cou'd not blame A short divorce due to his injur'd fame. The debt discharg'd, then shou'd her soldier come Gay from the field, and flush'd with conquest, home; With equal ardour her affection meet, And lay his laurels at his mistress' feet. He ceas'd, and sighing took a kind adieu; Then urg'd his steed; the fierce Grifippo flew; With rapid force outstripp'd the lagging wind, And left the blissful shores, and weeping fair behind; Now o'er the seas pursued his airy flight, Now scower'd the plains, and climb'd the mountain's height. Thus driving on at speed the prince had run Near half his course, when, with the setting sun, As thro' a lonely lane he chanc'd to ride, With rocks and bushes fenc'd on either side, He spied a waggon full of wings, that lay Broke and o'erturn'd across the narrow way. The helpless driver on the dirty road Lay struggling, crush'd beneath th'incumbent load. Never in human shape was seen before A wight so pale, so feeble, and so poor. Comparisons of age would do him wrong, For Nestor's self, if plac'd by him, were young. His limbs were naked all, and worn so thin, The bones seem'd starting thro' the parchment skin, His eyes half drown'd in rheum, his accents weak, Bald was his head, and furrow'd was his cheek. The conscious steed stopp'd short in deadly fright, And back recoiling stretch'd his wings for flight. When thus the wretch with supplicating tone, And rueful face, began his piteous moan, And, as he spake, the tears ran trickling down. O gentle youth, if pity e'er inclin'd Thy soul to gen'rous deeds, if e'er thy mind Was touch'd with soft distress, extend thy care To save an old man's life, and ease the load I bear. So may propitious heav'n your journey speed, Prolong your days, and all your vows succeed. Mov'd with the pray'r the kind Porsenna staid, Too nobly-minded to refuse his aid, And, prudence yielding to superior grief, Leap'd from his steed, and ran to his relief; Remov'd the weight, and gave the pris'ner breath, Just choak'd, and gasping on the verge of death. Then reach'd his hand, when lightly with a bound The grizly spectre vaulting from the ground, Seiz'd him with sudden gripe, th'astonish'd prince Stood horror-struck, and thoughtless of defence. O king of Russia, with a thund'ring sound Bellow'd the ghastly fiend, at length thou'rt found. Receive the ruler of mankind, and know, My name is Time, thy ever-dreaded foe. These feet are founder'd, and the wings you see Worn to the pinions in pursuit of thee; Thro' all the world in vain for ages sought, But Fate has doom'd thee now, and thou art caught. Then round his neck his arms he nimbly cast, And seiz'd him by the throat, and grasp'd him fast; Till forc'd at length the soul forsook its seat, And the pale breathless corse fell bleeding at his feet. Scarce had the cursed spoiler left his prey, When, so it chanc'd, young Zephyr pass'd that way; Too late his presence to assist his friend, A sad, but helpless witness of his end. He chafes, and fans, and strives in vain to cure His streaming wounds; the work was done too sure. Now lightly with a soft embrace uprears The lifeless load, and bathes it in his tears; Then to the blissful seats with speed conveys, And graceful on the mossy carpet lays With decent care, close by the fountain's side, Where first the princess had her phœnix spied. There with sweet flow'rs his lovely limbs he strew'd, And gave a parting kiss, and sighs and tears bestow'd. To that sad solitude the weeping dame, Wild with her loss, and swoln with sorrow, came. There was she wont to vent her griefs, and mourn Those dear delights that must no more return. Thither that morn with more than usual care She sped, but O what joy to find him there! As just arriv'd, and weary with the way, Retir'd to soft repose her hero lay. Now near approaching she began to creep With careful steps, loth to disturb his sleep; Till quite o'ercome with tenderness she flew, And round his neck her arms in transport threw. But, when she found him dead, no tongue can tell The pangs she felt; she shriek'd, and swooning fell. Waking, with loud laments she pierc'd the skies, And fill'd th'affrighted forest with her cries. That fatal hour the palace gates she barr'd, And fix'd around the coast a stronger guard; Now rare appearing, and at distance seen, With crowds of black misfortunes plac'd between; Mischiefs of ev'ry kind, corroding care, And fears, and jealousies, and dark despair. And since that day (the wretched world must own These mournful truths by sad experience known) No mortal e'er enjoy'd that happy clime, And ev'ry thing on earth submits to Time. The EVER-GREEN. When tepid breezes fann'd the air, And violets perfum'd the glade, Pensive and grave my charming fair Beneath yon shady lime was laid. Flourish, said I, those favour'd boughs, And ever sooth the purest flames! Witness to none but faithful vows! Wounded by none but faithful names! Yield every tree that crowns the grove To this which pleas'd my wandering dear! Range where you will, ye bands of love, Ye still shall seem to revel here. Lavinia smil'd—and whilst her arm Her fair reclining head sustain'd, Betray'd she felt some fresh alarm; And thus the meaning smile explain'd. When summer suns shine forth no more, Will then this lime its shelter yield? Protect us when the tempests roar, And winter drives us from the field? Yet faithful then the fir shall last— I smile, she cry'd, but ah! I tremble, To think when my fair season's past, Which Damon then will most resemble. ANSWER. Too timorous maid! can time or chance A pure ingenuous flame controul? O lay aside that tender glance, That melts my frame, that kills my soul! Were but thy outward charms admir'd, Frail origin of female sway! My flame like other flames inspir'd, Might then like other flames decay: But whilst thy mind shall seem thus fair, Thy soul's unfading charms be seen; Thou may'st resign that shape and air, Yet find thy swain—an ever-green. CANDOUR. The warmest friend, I ever prov'd, My bitterest foe I see: The kindest maid I ever lov'd, Is false to love and me. But shall I make the angry vow, Which tempts my wavering mind? Shall dark suspicion cloud my brow, And bid me shun mankind? Avaunt, thou hell-born fiend! no more Pretend my steps to guide; Let me be cheated o'er and o'er, But let me still confide. If this be folly, all my claim To wisdom I resign; But let no sage presume to name His happiness with mine. LYSANDER to CLOE. 'Tis true, my wish will never find Another nymph so fair, so true; Since all that's bright, and all that's kind, In those expressive eyes I view. And I with grateful zeal could haste To China for the merest toy; Could scorch on Lybia's barren waste, To give my dear a moment's joy. But fickle as the wave or wind, I once may flight those lovely arms; Pardon a free ingenuous mind, I do not half deserve thy charms. If I in any praise excel, 'Tis in soft themes to paint my flame; But Cloe's sweetness bids me tell, I shall not long remain the same. I know its season will expire, Replac'd by cool esteem alone; Nor more thy matchless breast admire Than I detest and scorn my own. This interval my fate allows, And friendship dictates all I say; O shun to hear my future vows, When giddy love resumes the lay. So some poor maniac can foresee The random hours of madness nigh; He mourns the fates' severe decree, And cautions whom he loves to fly. CLOE to LYSANDER. Of vagrant loves, and fickle flames Lysander's Muse may tell, And sure such artless freedom claims His Cloe's best farewel. Whene'er his heart becomes the theme We see his fancy shine; But let not vain Lysander dream That e'er that heart was mine. Can he that fondly hopes to move, With caution chill his lay? Can he who feels the power of love, Foretel that love's decay? Why teize believing nymphs in vain? Go seek some pathless vale, And listen to thy vocal strain Soft echoing down the dale. While artless Cloe hence retir'd, Shall this sad maxim prove; No bosom, once with love inspir'd, Could ever cease to love. To the Memory of an agreeable Lady bury'd in Marriage to a Person undeserving her. 'Twas always held, and ever will, By sage mankind, discreeter T'anticipate a lesser ill Than undergo a greater, When mortals dread diseases, pain, And languishing conditions; Who don't the lesser ills sustain Of physic and physicians? Rather than lose his whole estate, He that but little wise is, Full gladly pays four parts in eight To taxes and excises. With numerous ills in single life The batchelor's attended; Such to avoid, he takes a wife— And much the case is mended. Poor Gratia, in her twentieth year, Foreseeing future woe, Chose to attend a monkey here, Before an ape below. An Elegy, written on Valentine Morning. By ? Hark, thro' the sacred silence of the night, Loud Chanticleer doth sound his clarion shrill, Hailing with song the first pale gleam of light, That floats the dark brow of yon eastern hill. Bright star of morn, oh! leave not yet the wave, To deck the dewy frontlet of the day, Nor thou, Aurora, quit Tithonus' cave, Nor drive retiring darkness yet away, Ere these my rustic hands a garland twine, Ere yet my tongue indite a simple song, For her I mean to hail my Valentine, Sweet maiden, fairest of the virgin throng. Sweet is the morn, and sweet the gentle breeze That fans the fragrant bosom of the spring, Sweet chirps the lark, and sweeter far than these The gentle love-song gurgling turtles sing. Oh let the flowers be fragrant as the morn, And as the turtle's song my ditty sweet: Those flowers my woven chaplet must adorn, That ditty must my waking charmer greet. And thou, blest saint, whom choral creatures join In one enlivening symphony to hail, Oh be propitious, gentle Valentine, And let each holy tender sigh prevail. Oh give me to approach my sleeping love, And strew her pillow with the freshest flowers, No sigh unhallow'd shall my bosom move, Nor step prophame pollute my true-love's bowers. At sacred distance only will I gaze, Nor bid my unreproved eye refrain, Mean while my tongue shall chaunt her beauty's praise, And hail her sleeping with the gentlest strain. “Awake my fair, awake, for it is time; Hark, thousand songsters rise from yonder grove, And rising carol this sweet hour of prime, Each to his mate, a roundelay of love. All nature sings the hymeneal song, All nature follows, where the spring invites; Come forth my love, to us these joys belong, Ours is the spring, and all her young delights. For us she throws profusely forth her flowers, Which in fresh chaplets joyful I will twine; Come forth my fair, oh do not lose these hours, But wake, and be my faithful Valentine. Full many an hour, all lonely have I sigh'd, Nor dared the secret of my love reveal, Full many a fond expedient have I tried My warmest wish in silence to conceal. And oft to far retired solitude All mournfully my slow step have I bent, Luxurious there indulg'd my musing mood, And there alone have given my sorrows vent. This day resolv'd I dare to plight my vow, This day, long since the feast of love decreed, Embolden'd will I speak my flame, nor thou Refuse to hear how sore my heart does bleed.” Yet if I should behold my love awake, Ah frail resolves, ah whither will ye fly? Full well I know I shall not silence break, But struck with awe almost for fear shall die. Oh no, I will not trust a fault'ring speech In broken phrase an aukward tale to tell, A tale, whose tenderness no tongue can reach, Nor softest melody can utter well. But my meek eye, best herald to my heart, I will compose to soft and downcast look, And at one humble glance it shall impart My love, nor fear the language be mistook. For she shall read (apt scholar at this lore) With what fond passion my true bosom glows, How hopeless of return I still adore, Nor dare the boldness of my wish disclose. Should she then smile,—yet ah! she smiles on all, Her gentle temper pities all distress; On every hill, each vale, the sun-beams fall, Each herb, and flow'r, each tree, and shrub they bless. Alike all nature grateful owns the boon, The universal ray to all is free; Like fond Endymion should I hope the moon, Because among the rest she shines on me? Hope, vain presumer, keep, oh keep away: Ev'n if my woe her gentle bosom move, Pity some look of kindness may display; But each soft glance is not a look of love. Yet heav'nly visitant, thou dost not quit Those bow'rs where angels sweet division sing, Nor deignest thou on mortal shrine to sit Alone, for round thee ever on the wing, Glad choirs of loves attend, and hov'ring wait Thy mild command; of these thy blooming train Oh bid some sylph in morning dreams relate, Ere yet my love awake, my secret pain. The DOWAGER. By the Same. Where aged elms in many a goodly row Give yearly shelter to the constant crow, A mansion stands:—long since the pile was rais'd, Whose Gothic grandeur the rude hind amaz'd. For the rich ornament on ev'ry part, Confess'd the founder's wealth, and workman's art: Tho' as the range of the wide court we tread, The broken arch now totters o'er the head; And where of old rose high the social smoke, Now swallows build, and lonely ravens croak. Tho' Time, whose touch each beauty can deface, Has torn from ev'ry tow'r the sculptur'd grace; Tho' round each stone the sluggard ivy crawls, Yet ancient state sits hov'ring on the walls. Where wont the festal chorus to resound, And jocund dancing frequent beat the ground, Now Silence spreads around her gloomy reign, Save when the mastiff clanks his iron chain, Save when his hoarse bark echoes dire alarm, Fierce to protect the place from midnight harm, Its only guard; no revel sounding late Drives the night villain from the lonely gate. An hallow'd matron and her simple train These solemn battlements alone contain; An hoary dowager, whose placid face Old age has deck'd with lovely aweful grace; With almost vernal bloom her cheek still strow'd, As beauty ling'ring left her lov'd abode; That lov'd abode, where join'd with truth and sense She form'd the features to mute eloquence, And bade them charm the still attentive throng, Who watch'd the sacred lessons of her tongue. For not thro' life the dame had liv'd retir'd, But once had shone, e'en 'midst a court admir'd: What time the lov'd possessor of her charms Returning from the war in victor arms, Call'd from his monarch's tongue the plausive praise, While honour wreath'd him with unfading bays. She, happy partner of each joyful hour, Then walk'd serene amid the pomp of pow'r: While all confess'd no warrior's wish could move For fairer prize, than such accomplish'd love: Nor to that love could aught more transport yield, Than graceful valour from the victor field. Thus flourish'd once the beauteous and the brave; But mortal bliss meets still th'untimely grave: Aurelius died—his relict's pious tear O'er his lov'd ashes frequent flow'd sincere, Each decent rite with due observance paid, Each solemn requiem offer'd to his shade, Plac'd 'mid the brave his urn in holy ground, And bade his hallow'd banners wave around. Then left the gaudy scenes of pomp and power, While prudence beckon'd to that ancient bower, And those paternal fields, the sole remains Of ample woods and far-extended plains, Which tyrant custom rudely tore away To distant heirship an expected prey. Serene she sought the far-retired grove, Once the bless'd mansion of her happy love, Pleas'd with the thought, that memory oft would raise A solemn prospect of those blooming days Aurelius gave: her pious purpose now To keep still constant to her sacred vow; In lonely luxury her sorrows feed, And pass her life in widow's decent weed. One pledge of love her comfort still remain'd, Whom in this solitude she careful train'd To virtuous lore; and while as year by year New graces made Aurelia still more dear; Full many an hour unheeded she would trace The father's semblance in the daughter's face; While tender sighs oft heav'd her faithful breast, And sudden tears her lasting love exprest. Thus long she dwelt in innate virtues great, Amid the villagers in sacred state: For ev'ry grace to which submission bows, The pow'r which conscious dignity bestows, She felt superior; for from ancient race She gloried her long ancestry to trace; And ever bade Aurelia's thought aspire To every grace, each ray of sacred fire, That full of heav'n-born dignity informs The mortal breast which ardent virtue warms; Then led her to the venerable hall Where her successive sires adorn'd the wall, And arched windows with their blazon bright Shed thro' the herald glow a solemn light: There clad in rough habiliments of war Full many a hero bore a glorious scar; There in the civic fur the sons of peace, Whose counsels bade their country's tumults cease; While by their side, gracing the ancient scene, Hung gentle ladies of most comely mien. Then eager thro' the well-known tale she run, In what fair cause each honour had been won, What female grace each virgin had possess'd To charm to gentle love the manly breast; Pleas'd to observe how long her gen'rous blood Thro' fair and brave had pass'd a spotless flood. Mean while the young Aurelia's bosom sir'd With emulation by each tale inspir'd, In eager transport frequent breath'd her prayer The graces of her ancestry to share: Nor breath'd in vain, her fond maternal guide Cherish'd with care each spark of virtuous pride; And ever as she gave a lesson new, Would point some old example to her view: Inflam'd by this, her mind was quickly fraught With each sage precept, that her mother taught. The goodly dame thus bless'd in her employ, Felt each soft transport of parental joy, And liv'd content, her utmost wish fulfill'd In the fair prospect of a virtuous child: Resign'd she waited now the aweful hour When death should raise her to that heav'nly bow'r, Where with her lov'd Aurelius she might share The pleasing task, to watch with guardian care Their offspring's steps, and hov'ring o'er her head, The gracious dew of heavenly peace to shed; Nor fear'd her decency of life would prove An added bliss to all the joys above. ODE to the Honourable ? By the late Mr. F. COVENTRY. Now Britain's senate, far renown'd, Assembles full an aweful band! Now Majesty with golden circle crown'd, Mounts her bright throne, and waves her gracious hand. “Ye chiefs of Albion with attention hear, “Guard well your liberties, review your laws, “Begin, begin th'important year, “And boldly speak in Freedom's cause.” Then starting from her summer's rest Glad Eloquence unbinds her tongue. She feels rekindling raptures wake her breast, And pours the sacred energy along. 'Twas here great Hampden's patriot voice was heard, Here Pym, Kimbolton fir'd the British soul, When Pow'r her arm despotic rear'd But felt a senate's great controul. 'Twas here the pond'ring worthies sat, Who fix'd the crown on William's head, When awe-struck tyranny renounc'd the state, And bigot James his injur'd kingdoms fled. Thee, generous youth, whom nature, birth adorn, The Muse selects from yon assembled throng: O thou to serve thy country born, Tell me, young hero of my song, Thy genius now in fairest bloom, And warm with fancy's brightest rays, Why sleeps thy soul unconscious of its doom? Why idly fleet thy unapplauded days? Thy country beckons thee with lifted hand, Arise, she calls, awake thy latent flame, Arise, 'tis England's high command, And snatch the ready wreaths of fame. Be this thy passion; greatly dare A people's jarring wills to sway, With curst Corruption wage eternal war, That where thou goe'st, applauding crowds may say, “Lo, that is he, whose spirit-ruling voice “From her wild heights can call Ambition down, “Can still Sedition's brutal noise, “Or shake a tyrant's purple throne:” Then chiefs, and sages yet unborn Shall boast thy thoughts in distant days, With thee fair History her leaves adorn, And laurell'd bards proclaim thy lasting praise. To Miss ?. By Miss Elisa Carter. I The midnight moon serenely smiles O'er nature's soft repose, No lowring cloud obscures the skies, Nor ruffling tempest blows. II Now every passion sinks to rest, The throbbing heart lies still, And varying schemes of life no more Distract the labouring will. III In silence hush'd, to reason's voice Attends each mental power; Come dear Amanda, and enjoy Reflection's favourite hour. IV Come, while this peaceful scene invites, Let's search this ample round; Where shall the lovely fleeting form Of Happiness be found? V Does it amidst the frolic mirth Of gay assemblies dwell? Or hide beneath the solemn gloom That shades the hermit's cell? VI How oft the laughing brow of joy A sick'ning heart conceals, And thro' the cloister's deep recess Invading sorrow steals. VII In vain thro' beauty, fortune, wit, The fugitive we trace! It dwells not in the faithless smile That brightens Clodio's face. VIII Howe'er our varying notions rove, All yet agree, in one, To place its being in some state, At distance from our own. IX O blind to each indulgent gift Of power, supremely wise, Who fancy happiness in aught That Providence denies. X Vain is alike the joy we seek, And vain what we possess, Unless harmonious reason tunes The passions into peace. XI To temp'rate bounds, to few desires, Is happiness confin'd, And deaf to folly's noise attends The music of the mind. Lady Mary W?, to Sir W? Y? I Dear Colin, prevent my warm blushes, Since how can I speak without pain? My eyes have oft told you their wishes, Ah! can't you their meaning explain? My passion wou'd lose by expression, And you too might cruelly blame: Then don't you expect a confession Of what is too tender to name. II Since yours is the province of speaking, Why shou'd you expect it of me? Our wishes shou'd be in our keeping, 'Till you tell us what they shou'd be. Then quickly why don't you discover? Did your breast feel tortures like mine, Eyes need not tell over and over What I in my bosom confine. Sir W? Y?'s Answer. I Good madam, when ladies are willing, A man must needs look like a fool; For me I wou'd not give a shilling For one that is kind out of rule. At least you might stay for my offer, Not snatch like old maids in despair, If you've liv'd to these years without proffer, Your sighs are now lost in the air. II You might leave me to guess by your blushing, And not speak the matter so plain; 'Tis ours to pursue and be pushing, 'Tis yours to affect a disdain. That you're in a pitiful taking, By all your sweet ogles I see; But the fruit that will fall without shaking Indeed is too mellow for me. Miss Soper's Answer to a Lady, who invited her to retire into a monastic Life at St. Cross, near Winchester. I In vain, mistaken maid, you'd fly To desart and to shade; But since you call, for once I'll try How well your vows are made. II To noise and cares let's bid adieu, And solitude commend. But how the world will envy you, And pity me your friend! III You, like rich metal hid in earth, Each swain will dig to find; But I expect no second birth, For dross is left behind. REPENTANCE. By the Same. I All attendants apart I examin'd my heart, Last night when I lay'd me to rest; And methinks I'm inclin'd To a change of my mind, For, you know, second thoughts are the best. II To retire from the crowd And make ourselves good, By avoiding of every temptation, Is in truth to reveal What we'd better conceal, That our passions want some regulation. III It will much more redound To our praise to be found, In a world so abounding with evil, Unspotted and pure; Tho' not so demure, As to wage open war with the devil. IV Then bidding farewell To the thoughts of a cell, I'll prepare for a militant life; And if brought to distress, Why then—I'll confess, And do penance in shape of a wife. A SONG. By T. P?cy. O Nancy, wilt thou go with me, Nor sigh to leave the flaunting town: Can silent glens have charms for thee, The lowly cot and russet gown? No longer dress'd in silken sheen, No longer deck'd with jewels rare, Say can'st thou quit each courtly scene, Where thou wert fairest of the fair? O Nancy! when thou'rt far away, Wilt thou not cast a wish behind? Say canst thou face the parching ray, Nor shrink before the wintry wind? O can that soft and gentle mien Extremes of hardship learn to bear, Nor sad regret each courtly scene, Where thou wert fairest of the fair? O Nancy! can'st thou love so true, Thro' perils keen with me to go, Or when thy swain mishap shall rue, To share with him the pang of woe? Say should disease or pain befal, Wilt thou assume the nurse's care, Nor wistful those gay scenes recall Where thou wert fairest of the fair? And when at last thy love shall die, Wilt thou receive his parting breath? Wilt thou repress each struggling sigh, And clear with smiles the bed of death? And wilt thou o'er his breathless clay Strew flow'rs, and drop the tender tear, Nor then regret those scenes so gay, Where thou wert fairest of the fair? CYNTHIA, an Elegiac Poem. By the Same. ? Libeat tibi Cynthia mecum Roscida muscosis antra tenere jugis. Propert. Beneath an aged oak's embow'ring shade, Whose spreading arms with gray moss fringed were, Around whose trunk the clasping ivy stray'd; A love-lorn youth oft pensive wou'd repair. Fast by, a Naïd taught her stream to glide, Which thro' the dale a winding channel wore; The silver willow deck'd its verdant side, The whisp'ring sedges wav'd along the shore. Here oft, when Morn peep'd o'er the dusky hill; Here oft when Eve bedew'd the misty vale; Careless he laid him all beside the rill, And pour'd in strains like these his artless tale. Ah! would he say—and then a sigh would heave: Ah Cynthia! sweeter than the breath of morn, Soft as the gentle breath that fans at eve, Of thee bereft how shall I live forlorn? Ah! what avails this sweetly solemn bow'r That silent stream where dimpling eddies play; Yon thymy bank bedeck'd with many a flow'r, Where maple-tufts exclude the beam of day. Robb'd of my love, for how can these delight, Tho' lavish Spring her smiles around has cast! Despair, alas! that whelms the soul in night, Dims the sad eye and deadens every taste. As droops the lilly at the blighting gale; Or ? On her left breast A mole cinque-spotted: like the crimson drops I'th' bottom of a cowslip. Shakespear's Cymbeline, Act 3. crimson-spotted cowslip of the mead, Whose tender stalk (alas! their stalk so frail) Some hasty foot hath bruis'd with heedless tread: As droops the woodbine, when some village hind Hath fell'd the sapling elm it fondly bound; No more it gadding dances in the wind, But trails its fading beauties on the ground: So droops my soul, dear maid, downcast and sad, For ever! ah! for ever torn from thee; Bereft of each sweet hope, which once it had, When love, when treacherous love first smil'd on me. Return blest days, return ye laughing hours, Which led me up the roseat steep of youth; Which strew'd my simple path with vernal flow'rs, And bade me court chaste Science and fair Truth. Ye know, the curling breeze, or gilded fly That idly wantons in the noon-tide air, Was not so free, was not so gay as I, For ah! I knew not then or love, or care. Witness ye winged daughters of the year, If e'er a sigh had learnt to heave my breast If e'er my cheek was conscious of a tear, 'Till Cynthia came and rob'd my soul of rest! O have you seen, bath'd in the morning dew, The budding rose its infant bloom display; When first its virgin tints unfold to view, It shrinks and scarcely trusts the blaze of day. So soft, so delicate, so sweet she came, Youth's damask glow just dawning on her cheek: I gaz'd, I sigh'd, I caught the tender flame, Felt the fond pang, and droop'd with passion, weak. Yet not unpitied was my pain the while; For oft beside yon sweet-briar in the dale, With many a blush, with many a melting smile, She sate and listen'd to the plaintive tale. Ah me! I fondly dreamt of pleasures rare, Nor deem'd so sweet a face with scorn cou'd glow; How could you cruel then pronounce despair, Chill the warm hope, and plant the thorn of woe? What tho' no treasures canker in my chest, Nor crowds of suppliant vassals hail me lord! What tho' my roof can boast no princely guest, Nor surfeits lurk beneath my frugal board! Yet should Content, that shuns the gilded bed, With smiling Peace, and Virtue there forgot, And rose-lip'd Health, which haunts the straw-built shed, With cherub Joy, frequent my little cot: Led by chaste Love, the decent band should come, O charmer would'st thou deign my roof to share? Nor should the Muses scorn our simple dome, Or knit in mystic dance, the Graces fair. The wood-land nymphs, and gentle fays, at eve Forth from the dripping cave and mossy dell, Should round our hearth fantastic measures weave, And shield from mischief by their guardian spell. Come then bright maid, and quit the city throng, Have rural joys no charm to win the soul? —She proud, alas! derides my lowly song, Scorns the fond vow, and spurns the russet stole. Then Love begone, thy thriftless empire yield, In youthful toils I'll lose the unmanly pain: With echoing horns I'll rouse the jocund field, Urge the keen chace, and sweep along the plain. Or all in some lone moss-grown tow'r sublime With midnight lamp I'll watch pale Cynthia round, Explore the choicest rolls of ancient Time, And heal with Wisdom's balm my hapless wound. Or else I'll roam—Ah no! that sigh profound, Tells me that stubborn love disdains to yield; Nor flight, nor Wisdom's balm can heal the wound, Nor pain forsake me in the jocund field. DIALOGUE to CHLORINDA. By Mr. ALSOP. S. Cease, Chlorinda, cease to chide me, When my passion I relate: Why shou'd kindness be denied me? Why shou'd love be pay'd with hate? If the fruit of all my wishes Must be, to be treated so; What cou'd you do more than this is To your most outrageous foe? C. Simple Strephon, cease complaining, Talk no more of foolish love; Think not e'er my heart to reign in, Think not all you say can move. Did I take delight to fetter Thrice ten thousand slaves a day, Thrice ten thousand times your betters Gladly would my rule obey. S. Strive not, fairest, to unbind me; Let me keep my pleasing chain: Charms that first to love inclin'd me, Will for ever love maintain. Wou'd you send my heart a roving? First to love I must forbear. Wou'd you have me cease from loving? You must cease from being fair. C. Strephon, leave to talk thus idly; Let me hear of love no more: You mistake Chlorinda widely, Thus to teize her o'er and o'er. Seek not her who still forbids you; To some other tell your moan: Chuse where'er your fancy leads you, Let Chlorinda but alone. S. If Chlorinda still denies me That which none but she can give, Let the whole wide world despise me, 'Tis for her alone I live. Grant me yet this one poor favour, With this one request comply; Let us each go on for ever, I to ask, and you deny. C. Since, my Strephon, you so kind are, All pretensions to resign; Trust Chlorinda.—You may find her Less severe than you divine. Strephon struck with joy beholds her, Wou'd have spoke but knew not how; But he look'd such things as told her More than all his speech cou'd do. To CHLORINDA. By the Same. See, Strephon, what unhappy fate Does on thy fruitless passion wait, Adding to flame fresh fuel: Rather than thou should'st favour find, The kindest soul on earth's unkind, And the best nature cruel. The goodness, which Chlorinda shews, From mildness and good breeding flows, But must not love be stil'd: Or else 'tis such as mothers try, When wearied with incessant cry, They still a froward child. She with a graceful mien and air, Genteely civil, yet severe, Bids thee all hopes give o'er. Friendship she offers, pure and free; And who, with such a friend as she, Cou'd want, or wish for more? The cur that swam along the flood, His mouth well fill'd with morsel good, (Too good for common cur!) By visionary hopes betray'd, Gaping to catch a fleeting shade, Lost what he held before. Mark, Strephon, and apply this tale, Lest love and friendship both should fail; Where then wou'd be thy hope? Of hope, quoth Strephon, talk not, friend; And for applying—know, the end Of ev'ry cur's a rope. The Fable of Ixion. To CHLORINDA. By the Same. Ixion, as the poets tell us, Was one of those pragmatic fellows, Who claim a right to kiss the hand Of the best lady in the land; Demonstrating by dint of reason, That impudence in love's no treason. He let his fancy soar much higher; And ventur'd boldly to aspire To Juno's high and mighty grace, And woo'd the goddess face to face. What mortal e'er had whims so odd, To think of cuckolding a God? For she was both Jove's wife and sister, And yet the rascal wou'd have kiss'd her. How he got up to heav'n's high palace, Not one of all the poets tell us; It must be therefore understood, That he got up which way he cou'd. Nor is it, that I know, recorded, How bows were made, and speeches worded; So, leaving this to each one's guess, I'll only tell you the success. But first I stop awhile to shew What happen'd lately here below. Chlorinda, who beyond compare Of all the fair ones is most fair; Chlorinda, by the Gods design'd To be the pattern of her kind, With every charm of face and mind; Glanc'd light'ning from her eyes so blue, And shot poor Strephon through and through. He, over head and ears her lover, Try'd all the ways he cou'd to move her; He sigh'd, and vow'd, and pray'd, and cry'd, And did a thousand things beside: She let him sigh, and pray, and cry on— But now hear more about Ixion. The Goddess, proud, (as folks report her) Disdain'd that mortal wight shou'd court her, And yet she chose the fool to flatter, To make him fancy some great matter, And hope in time he might get at her; Grac'd him with now and then a smile, But inly scorn'd him all the while; Resolv'd at last a trick to shew him, Seeming to yield and so undo him. Now which way, do you think, she took? (For do't she wou'd by hook or crook) Why, thus I find it in my book. She call'd a pretty painted cloud, The brightest of the wand'ring crowd, For she you know is queen o'th' air, And all the clouds and vapours there Governs at will, by nod or summons, As Walpole does the house of commons. This cloud which came to her stark naked, She dress'd as fine as hands could make it. From her own wardrobe out she brought Whate'er was dainty, wove or wrought. A smock which Pallas spun and gave her Once on a time to gain her favour; A gown that ha'n't on earth its fellow, Of finest blue and lined with yellow, Fit for a Goddess to appear in, And not a pin the worse for wearing. A quilted petticoat beside, With whalebone hoop six fathom wide. With these she deck'd the cloud, d'ye see? As like herself, as like cou'd be: So like, that cou'd not I or you know Which was the cloud, and which was Juno. Thus dress'd she sent it to the villain, To let him act his wicked will on: Then laugh'd at the poor fool aloud, Who for a Goddess grasp'd a cloud. This you will say was well done on her T'expose the tempter of her honour— But more of him you need not hear; Only to Strephon lend an ear. He never entertain'd one thought With which a Goddess could find fault; His spotless love might be forgiven By ev'ry saint in earth and heav'n. Juno herself, though nice and haughty, Wou'd not have judg'd his passion naughty. All this Chlorinda's self confess'd, And own'd his flame was pure and chaste, Read what his teeming Muse brought forth, And prais'd it far beyond its worth: Mildly receiv'd his fond address, And only blam'd his love's excess: Yet she, so good, so sweet, so smiling, So full of truth, so unbeguiling, One way or other still devis'd To let him see he was despis'd: And when he plum'd, and grew most proud, All was a vapour, all a cloud. A TALE. To CHLORINDA. By the Same. Dame Venus, a daughter of Jove's, And amongst all his daughters most fair, Lost, it seems, t'other day the two doves, That wafted her car thro' the air. The dame made a heavy sad rout, Ran about heav'n and earth to condole 'em; And sought high and low to find out, Where the biddyes were stray'd, or who stole 'em. To the God, who the stragglers shou'd meet, She promis'd most tempting fine pay, Six kisses than honey more sweet, And a seventh far sweeter than they. The proposal no sooner was made, But it put all the Gods in a flame; For who would not give all he had To be kiss'd by so dainty a dame? To Cyprus, to Paphos they run, Where the Goddess oft us'd to retire; Some rode round the world with the sun, And search'd every country and shire. But with all their hard running and riding, Not a God of 'em claim'd the reward; For no one could tell tale or tiding, If the doves were alive or were starv'd. At last the sly shooter of men Young Cupid, (I beg the God's pardon) Mamma, your blue birds I have seen In a certain terrestrial garden. Where, where, my dear child, quickly shew, Quoth the dame, almost out of her wits: Do but go to Chlorinda's, says Cu, And you'll find 'em in shape of pewits. Is it she that hath done me this wrong? Full well I know her, and her arts; She has follow'd the thieving trade long, But I thought she dealt only in hearts. I shall soon make her know, so I shall— And with that to Jove's palace she run, And began like a bedlam to bawl, I am cheated, I'm robb'd, I'm undone. Chlorinda, whom none can approach Without losing his heart or his senses, Has stol'n the two doves from my coach, And now flaunts it at Venus' expences. She has chang'd the poor things to pewits, And keeps 'em like ord'nary fowls: So when she robs men of their wits, She turns 'em to asses or owls. I cou'd tell you of many a hundred Of figure, high station, and means, Whom she without mercy has plunder'd, Ever since she came into her teens. But her thefts upon earth I'd have borne, Or have let 'em all pass for mere fable; But nothing will now serve her turn, But the doves out of Venus's stable. Is it fit, let your mightyship say, That I, like some pitiful flirt, Shou'd tarry within doors all day, Or else trudge it afoot in the dirt? Is it fit that a mortal shou'd trample On me, who am styl'd queen of beauty? O make her, great Jove, an example, And teach Nimble-fingers her duty. Sir Jove when he heard her thus rage, For all his great gravity, smil'd; And then, like a judge wise and sage, He began in terms sober and mild. Learn, daughter, to bridle your tongue, Forbear to traduce with your prattle The fair, who has done you no wrong, And scorns to purloin goods and chattel. She needs neither gewgaw nor trinket, To carry the world all before her; Her deserts, I wou'd have you to think it, Are enough to make all men adore her. Your doves are elop'd, I confess, And chuse with Chlorinda to dwell; But blame not the lady for this; For sure 'tis no crime to excel. As for them, I applaud their high aims; Having serv'd from the time of their birth The fairest of heavenly dames, They would now serve the fairest on earth. Ode on Lyric Poetry. By Mr. Marriot. I. 1 Inmate of smoaking cots, whose rustic shed, Within its humble bed, Her twittering progeny contains, The swallow sweeps the plains, Or lightly skims from level lakes the dew. The ringdove ever true In plaintive accents tells of unrelenting fate, Far from the raven's croak, and bird of night, That shrieking wings her flight When, at his mutter'd rite, Hid in the dusky desart vale, With starting eye, and visage pale The grimly wizard sees the spectres rise unholy; But haunts the woods that held her beauteous mate, And wooes the Echo soft with murmurs melancholy. 2 Sublime alone the feather'd monarch flies, His nest dark mists upon the mountains shrowd; In vain the howling storms arise, When borne on outstretch'd plume aloft he springs, Dashing with many a stroke the parting cloud, Or to the buoyant air commits his wings Floating with even sail adown the liquid skies; Then darting upward, swift his wings aspire, Where thunders keep their gloomy seat, And lightnings arm'd with heaven's avenging ire. None can the dread artillery meet, Or thro' the airy region rove, But he who guards the throne of Jove, And grasps the flaming bolt of sacred fire. 3 Know, with young Ambition bold, In vain, my Muse, thy dazled eyes explore Distant aims, where wont to soar, Their burning way the kindling spirits hold. Heights too arduous wisely shun; Humbler flights thy wings attend; For heaven-taught Genius can alone ascend Back to her native sky, And with directed eagle eye Pervade the lofty spheres, and view the blazing sun. II. 1 But hark! o'er all the flower-enamell'd ground What music breathes around! I see, I see the virgin train Unlock their streams again, Rolling to many a vale their liquid lapse along, While at the warbled song Which holds entranc'd Attention's wakeful ear, Broke are the magic bands of iron sleep. Love, wayward child, oft wont to weep, In tears his robe to steep Forgets; and Care that counts his store, Now thinks each mighty business o'er; While sits on ruin'd cities, war's wide-wasting glory, Ambition, ceasing the proud pile to rear, And sighs; unfinish'd leaving half her ample story. 2 Then once more, sweet enthusiast, happy lyre, Thy soothing solace deign awhile to bring. I strive to catch the sacred fire, And wake thee emulous on Granta's plain, Where all the Muses haunt his hallow'd spring, And where the Graces shun the sordid train Scornful of heaven-born arts which thee and peace inspire: On life's sequester'd scenes they silent wait, Nor heed the baseless pomp of power, Nor shining dreams that crowd at Fortune's gate; But smooth th'inevitable hour Of pain, which man is doom'd to know, And teach the mortal mind to glow With pleasures plac'd beyond the shaft of Fate. 3 But, alas! th'amusive reed Ill suits the lyre that asks a master's hand, And fond fancies vainly feed A breast that life's more active scenes demand. Sloth ignoble to disclaim 'Tis enough: the lyre unstring. At other feet the victor palm I fling In Granta's glorious shrine; Where crown'd with radiance divine Her smiles shall nurse the Muse; the Muse shall lift her fame. ARION, an Ode. By the Same. I. Queen of each sacred sound, sweet child of air, Who sitting thron'd upon the vaulted sky, Dost catch the notes which undulating fly, Oft wafted up to thy exalted sphere, On the soft bosom of each rolling cloud, Charming thy list'ning ear With strains that bid the panting lover die: Or laughing mirth, or tender grief inspire, Or with full chorus loud Which lift our holy hope, or fan the hero's fire: Enchanting Harmony, 'tis thine to cheer The soul by woe which sinks opprest, From sorrow's eye to wipe the tear, And on the bleeding wound to pour the balmy rest. II. 'Twas when the winds were roaring loud, And Ocean swell'd his billows high, By savage hands condemn'd to die, Rais'd on the stem the trembling Lesbian stood; All pale he heard the tempest blow, As on the watry grave below He fix'd his weeping eye. Ah! hateful lust of impious gold, What can thy mighty rage with-hold, Deaf to the melting powers of Harmony! But ere the bard unpitied dies, Again his soothing art he tries, Again he sweeps the strings, Slowly sad the notes arise, While thus in plaintive sounds the sweet musician sings. III. From beneath the coral cave Circled with the silver wave, Where with wreaths of emerald crown'd Ye lead the festive dance around, Daughters of Venus, hear, and save. Ye Tritons, hear, whose blast can swell With mighty sounds the twisted shell; And you, ye sister Syrens, hear, Ever beauteous, ever sweet, Who lull the list'ning pilot's ear With magic song, and softly breath'd deceit. By all the Gods who subject roll From gushing urns their tribute to the main, By him who bids the winds to roar, By him whose trident shakes the shore, If e'er for you I raise the sacred strain When pious mariners your power adore, Daughters of Nereus, hear and save. IV. He sung, and from the coral cave, Circled with the silver wave, With pitying ear The Nereids hear. Gently the waters flowing, The winds now ceas'd their blowing, In silence listening to his tuneful lay. Around the bark's sea-beaten side, The sacred dolphin play'd, And sportive dash'd the briny tide: The joyous omen soon the bard survey'd, Nor fear'd with bolder leap to try the watry way. On his scaly back now riding, O'er the curling billow gliding, Again with bold triumphant hand He bade the notes aspire, Again to joy attun'd the lyre, Forgot each danger past, and reach'd secure the land. HORACE, Book II. Ode II. Imitated by Lord B?h.—Paul to Faz. Quid bellicosus Cantaber, &amp;c. I Never, dear Faz, torment thy brain With idle fears of France or Spain, Or any thing that's foreign: What can Bavaria do to us, What Prussia's monarch, or the Russ, Or e'en prince Charles of Lorrain? II Let us be cheerful whilst we can, And lengthen out the short-liv'd span, Enjoying every hour, The moon itself we see decay, Beauty's the worse for every day, And so's the sweetest flower. III How oft, dear Faz, have we been told, That Paul and Faz are both grown old, By young and wanton lasses? Then, since our time is now so short, Let us enjoy the only sport Of tossing off our glasses. IV From White's we'll move th'expensive scene, And steal away to Richmond Green; There free from noise and riot, Polly each morn shall fill our tea, Spead bread and butter—and then we Each night get drunk in quiet. V Unless perchance earl L? comes, As noisy as a dozen drums, And makes an horrid pother; Else might we quiet sit and quaff, And gently chat, and gayly laugh At this and that and t'other. VI Br? shall settle what's to pay, Adjust accompts by algebra; I'll always order dinner— Br? tho' solemn, yet is sly, And leers at Poll with roguish eye To make the girl a sinner. VII Powell, d'ye hear, let's have the ham, Some chickens and a chine of lamb— And what else?—let's see—look ye— Br? must have his damn'd boullie, B? fattens on his fricassee I'll have my water-suchy. VIII When dinner comes we'll drink about, No matter who is in, or out, 'Till wine or sleep o'ertake us; Each man may nod, or nap, or wink, And when it is our turn to drink, Our neighbour then shall wake us. IX Thus let us live in soft retreat, Nor envy, nor despise the great, Submit to pay our taxes; With peace or war be well content, 'Till eas'd by a good parliament, 'Till Scroop his hand relaxes. X Never enquire about the Rhine; But sill your glass, and drink your wine; Hope things may mend in Flanders: The Dutch we know are good allies, So are they all with subsidies, And we have choice commanders. XI Then here's the King, God bless his grace, Tho' neither you nor I have place, He hath many a sage adviser; And yet no treason's sure in this, Let who will take the pray'r amiss, God send 'em all much wiser. A PANEGYRIC on ALE. By T. W? ? Mea nec Falernæ Temperant vites, neque Formiani Pocula colles. Hor. Balm of my cares, sweet solace of my toils, Hail, juice benignant! o'er the costly cups Of riot-stirring wine, unwholsome draught, Let Pride's loose sons prolong the wasteful night: My sober ev'ning let the tankard bless, With toast imbrown'd, and fragrant nutmeg fraught, While the rich draught with oft repeated whiffs Tobacco mild improves: divine repast! Where no crude surfeit, or intemperate joys Of lawless Bacchus reign: but o'er my soul A calm Lethean creeps: in drowsy trance Each thought subsides, and sweet oblivion wraps My peaceful brain, as if the magic rod Of leaden Morpheus o'er mine eyes had shed Its opiate influence. What tho' sore ills Oppress, dire want of chill-dispelling coals, Or cheerful candle, save the makeweight's gleam Hap'ly remaining; heart-rejoicing ale Cheers the sad scene, and every want supplies. Meantime not mindless of the daily task Of tutor sage, upon the learned leaves Of deep Smiglecius much I meditate; While ale inspires, and lends her kindred aid The thought-perplexing labour to pursue, Sweet Helicon of logic!—But if friends Congenial call me from the toilsome page, To pot-house I repair, the sacred haunt, Where, Ale, thy votaries in full resort Hold rites nocturnal. In capacious chair Of monumental oak, and antique mould, That long has stood the rage of conquering Time Inviolate, (not in more ample seat Smokes rosy justice, when th'important cause, Whether of henroost or of mirthful rape, In all the majesty of paunch, he tries:) Studious of ease, and provident I place My gladsome limbs, while in repeated round Returns replenish'd the successive cup, And the brisk fire conspires to genial joy. Nor seldom to relieve the ling'ring hours In innocent delight, amusive putt On smooth joint-stool in emblematic play The vain vicissitudes of fortune shews. Nor reck'ning, name tremendous, me disturbs, Nor, call'd-for, chills my breast with sudden fear, While on the wonted door (expressive mark!) The frequent penny stands describ'd to view In snowy characters, a graceful row. Hail Ticking! surest guardian of distress, Beneath thy shelter pennyless I quaff The cheering cup: tho' much the poet's friend Ne'er yet attempted in poetic strain, Accept this humble tribute of my praise. Nor proctor thrice with vocal heel alarms Our joys secure, nor deigns the lowly roof Of pot-house snug to visit: wiser he The splendid tavern haunts, or coffee-house Of James or Juggins, where the grateful breath Of mild tobacco ne'er diffus'd its balm; But the lewd spendthrift, falsely deem'd polite, While steams around the fragrant Indian bowl Oft damns the vulgar sons of humbler Ale: In vain—the proctor's voice alarms their joy; Just fate of wanton pride, and vain excess! Nor less by day delightful is thy draught, Heart-easing Ale, whose sorrow-soothing sweets Oft I repeat in vacant afternoon, When tatter'd stockings ask my mending hand Not unexperienc'd, while the tedious toil Slides unregarded. Let the tender swain Each morn regale on nerve-relaxing tea, Companion meet of languor-loving nymph: Be mine each morn with eager appetite And hunger undissembled, to repair To friendly butt'ry, there on smoaking crust And foaming Ale to banquet unrestrain'd, Material breakfast! Thus in ancient times Our ancestors robust with liberal cups Usher'd the morn, unlike the languid sons Of modern days; nor ever had the might Of Britons brave decay'd, had thus they fed, With English Ale improving English worth. With Ale irriguous, undismay'd I har The frequent dun ascend my lofty dome Importunate: whether the plaintive voice Of laundress shrill awake my startled ear, Or taylor with obsequious bow advance; Or groom invade me with defying look And fierce demeanor, whose emaciate steeds Had panted oft beneath my goring steel; In vain they plead or threat; all-powerful Ale Excuses new supplies, and each descends With joyless pace and debt-despairing looks. E'en Sp?y with indignant bow retires, Sternest of duns! and conquer'd quits the field. Why did the gods such various blessings pour On helpless mortals, from their grateful hands So soon the short-liv'd bounty to recal? Thus while, improvident of future ill, I quaff the luscious tankard unrestrain'd, And thoughtless riot in ambrosial bliss, Sudden (dire fate of all things excellent!) Th'unpitying bursar's cross affixing hand Blast all my joys, and stops my glad career. Nor now the friendly pot-house longer yields A sure retreat when ev'ning shades the skies, Nor Noted alehouses in Oxford. Sheppard, rushless widow, now vouchsafes The wonted trust, and Noted alehouses in Oxford. Winter ticks no more. Thus Adam exil'd from the blissful scenes Of Eden griev'd, no more in hallow'd bow'r On nect'rine fruits to feast, fresh shade or vale No more to visit, or vine-mantled grot; But all forlorn the naked wilderness, And unrejoicing solitudes to trace. Thus too the matchless bard, whose lay resounds The Splendid Shilling's praise, in nightly gloom Of lonesome garret pin'd for cheerful Ale: Whose steps in verse Miltonic I pursue, Mean follower! like him with honest love Of Ale divine inspir'd, and love of song. But long may bounteous Heav'n with watchful care Avert his hapless fate! enough for me, That burning with congenial flame I dar'd His guiding steps at distance to pursue, And sing his fav'rite theme in kindred strains. ODE to the Genius of Italy, occasioned by the Earl of Corke's going Abroad. By Mr. J. DUNCOMBE. O thou that, on a pointless spear reclin'd, In dusk of eve oft tak'st thy lonely way Where Tyber's slow, neglected waters stray, And pour'st thy fruitless sorrows to the wind, Grieving to see his shore no more the seat Of arts and arms, and liberty's retreat, Italia's Genius, rear thy drooping head, Shake off thy trance, and weave an olive crown, For see! a noble guest appears, well known To all thy worthies, tho' in Britain bred; Guard well thy charge, for know, our polish'd isle Reluctant spares thee such a son as Boyle. There, while their sweets thy myrtle groves dispense, Lead to the Sabine or the Tuscan plain, Where playful Horace tun'd his amorous strain, And Tully pour'd the stream of eloquence; Nor fail to crown him with that ivy bloom, Which graceful mantles o'er thy Maro's tomb. At that blest spot, from vulgar cares refin'd, In some soft vision or indulgent dream Inspire his fancy with a glorious theme, And point new subjects to his generous mind, At once to charm his country, and improve The last, the youngest object of his love. But O! mark well his transports in that shade, Where circled by the bay's unfading green, Amidst a rural and sequester'd scene His much-lov'd Pliny rests his honour'd head: There, rapt in silence, will he gaze around, And strew with sweetest flowers the hallow'd grown. But see! the sage, to mortal view confest, Thrice waves the hand, and says, or seems to say, “The debt I owe thee how shall I repay? “Welcome to Latium's shore, illustrious guest! “Long may'st thou live to grace thy native isle, “Humane in thought and elegant in style! “While on thy consort I with rapture gaze “My own Calphurnia rises to my view: “That bliss unknown but to the virtuous few, “Briton! is thine; charm'd with domestic praise “Thine are those heart-felt joys that sweeten life, “The son, the friend, the daughter and the wife.” Content with such approof, when genial Spring Bids the shrill black-bird whistle in the vale, Home may he hasten with a prosperous gale, And Health protect him with her fost'ring wing; So shall Britannia to the wind and sea Entrust no more her fav'rite Orrery. To C? P?, Esq; From friendship's cradle up the verdant paths Of youth, life's jolly spring; and now sublim'd To its full manhood and meridian strength, Her latest stage, (for friendship ever hale Knows not old age, diseases, and decay, But burning keeps her sacred fire, 'till death's Cold hand extinguish) at this spot, this point, Here P?, we social meet, and gaze about, And look back to the scenes our pastime trod In nature's morning, when the gamesome hours Had sliding feet, and laugh'd themselves away. Luxurious season! vital prime! where Thames Flows by Etona's walls, and cheerful sees Her sons wide swarming; or where sedgy Cam Bathes with slow pace his academic grove, Pierian walks!—O never hope again, (Impossible! untenable!) to grasp Those joys again; to feel alike the pulse Dancing, and fiery spirits boiling high: Or see the pleasure that with careless wing Swept on, and flow'ry garlands toss'd around Disporting! Try to call her back—as well Bid yesterday return, arrest the flight Of Time; or musing by a river's brink, Say to the wave that huddles swiftly by For ever, from thy fountain roll anew. The merriment, the tale, and heartfelt laugh That echo'd round the table, idle guests, Must rise, and serious inmates take their place. Reflection's daughters, sad and world-worn thoughts Dislodging Fancy's empire—Yet who knows Exact the balance of our loss and gain? Who knows how far a rattle may outweigh The mace or scepter? But as boys resign The play-thing, bauble of their infancy, So fares it with maturer years: they sage, Imagination's airy regions quit, And under Reason's banner take the field, With resolution face the cloud or storm, While all their former rainbows die away. Some to the palace with regardful step, And courtly blandishment resort, and there Advance obsequious; in the sunshine bask Of princely grace, catch the creating eye, Parent of honours:—in the senate some Harangue the full-bench'd auditory, and wield Their list'ning passion (such the pow'r, the sway Of Reason's eloquence!)—or at the bar, Where Cowper, Talbot, Somers, Yorke before Pleaded their way to glory's chair supreme, And worthy fill'd it. Let not these great names Damp, but incite: nor Murray's praise obscure Thy younger merit. Know, these lights, ere yet To noon-day lustre kindled, had their dawn. Proceed familiar to the gate of Fame, Nor think the task severe, the prize too high Of toil and honour, for thy father's son. Epistle from the late Lord Viscount B?gb?ke to Miss Lucy A?k?ns. Dear thoughtless Clara to my verse attend, Believe for once thy lover and thy friend; Heaven to each sex has various gifts assign'd, And shewn an equal care of human-kind; Strength does to man's imperial race belong, To yours that beauty which subdues the strong; But as our strength when misapply'd, is lost, And what should save, urges our ruin most; Just so, when beauty prostituted lies, Of bawds the prey, of rakes th'abandon'd prize, Women no more their empire can maintain, Nor hope, vile slaves of lust, by love to reign. Superior charms but make their case the worse, And what should be their blessing, proves their curse. Oh nymph! that might, reclin'd on Cupid's breast, Like Psyche, sooth the God of love to rest; Or, if ambition mov'd thee, Jove enthral, Brandish his thunder, and direct its fall; Survey thyself, contemplate ev'ry grace Of that sweet form, of that angelic face, Then Clara say, were those delicious charms Meant for lewd brothels, and rude russians arms? No Clara, no! that person, and that mind, Were form'd by nature, and by heaven design'd For nobler ends; to these return, tho' late, Return to these, and so avert thy fate. Think Clara, think, (nor will that thought be vain) Thy slave, thy Harry, doom'd to drag his chain Of love, ill-treated and abus'd, that he From more inglorious chains might rescue thee. Thy drooping health restor'd; by his fond care, Once more thy beauty its full lustre wear; Mov'd by his love, by his example taught, Soon shall thy soul, once more with virtue fraught, With kind and gen'rous truth thy bosom warm, And thy fair mind, like thy fair person, charm. To virtue thus, and to thyself restor'd, By all admir'd, by one alone ador'd, Be to thy Harry ever kind and true, And live for him, who more than dies for you. The CHEAT's Apology. By Mr. ELLIS. 'Tis my vocation, Hal! Shakespear. Look round the wide world each profession, you'll find, Hath something dishonest, which myst'ry they call; Each knave points another, at home is stark blind, Except but his own, there's a cheat in them all: When tax'd with imposture the charge he'll evade, And like Falstaff pretend he but lives by his trade. The hero ambitious (like Philip's great son, Who wept when he found no more mischief to do) Ne'er scruples a neighbouring realm to o'er-run, While slaughters and carnage his sabre imbrue. Of rapine and murder the charge he'll evade, For conquest is glorious, and fighting his trade. The statesman, who steers by wise Machiavel's rules, Is ne'er to be known by his tongue or his face; They're traps by him us'd to catch credulous fools, And breach of his promise he counts no disgrace; But policy calls it, reproach to evade, For flatt'ry's his province, cajoling his trade. The priest will instruct you this world to despise, With all its vain pomp, for a kingdom on high; While earthly preferments are chiefly his prize, And all his pursuits give his doctrine the lye; He'll plead you the gospel, your charge to evade: The lab'rer's entititled to live by his trade. The lawyer, as oft on the wrong side as right, Who tortures for fee the true sense of the laws, While black he by sophistry proves to be white, And falshood and perjury lists in his cause; With steady assurance all crime will evade: His client's his care, and he follows his trade. The sons of Machaon, who thirsty for gold The patient past cure visit thrice in a day, Write largely the Pharmacop league to uphold, While poverty's left to diseases a prey; Are held in repute for their glitt'ring parade: Their practice is great, and they shine in their trade. Since then in all stations imposture is found, No one of another can justly complain; The coin he receives will pass current around, And where he is cousen'd he cousens again: But I, who for cheats this apology made, Cheat myself by my rhyming, and starve by my trade. SONG. By the Same. [As Chloe ply'd her needle's art] As Chloe ply'd her needle's art, A purple drop the spear Made from her heedless finger start, And from her eyes a tear. Ah! might but Chloe by her smart Be taught for mine to feel; Mine caus'd by Cupid's piercing dart, More sharp than pointed steel! Then I her needle would adore, Love's arrow it should be, Indu'd with such a subtle pow'r To reach her heart for me. Another. By the Same. [Sue venal Belinda to grant you the blessing] Sue venal Belinda to grant you the blessing As Jove courted Danae, or vain's your addressing; For love, she asserts, all that's generous inspires, And therefore rich tokens of love she requires. Such suitors as nothing but ardours are boasting, Will ne'er reach Elysium, but ever be coasting, Like pennyless ghosts deny'd passage by Charon, They'll find, without fee, unrelenting the fair one. But give me the nymph not ungrateful to wooing, Who love pays with love, and caresses with cooing, By whom a true heart is accepted as sterling, And Cupid alone makes her lover her darling. To Mr. Grenville on his intended Resignation. By RICHARD BERENGER, Esq; A wretch tir'd out with Fortune's blows, Resolv'd at once to end his woes; And like a thoughtless silly elf, In the next pond to drown himself. 'Tis fit, quoth he, my life should end, The cruel world is not my friend; I have nor meat, nor drink, nor cloaths, But want each joy that wealth bestows; Besides, I hold my life my own, And when I please may lay it down; A wretched hopeless thing am I, Forgetting, as forgot, I'll die. Not so, said one who stood behind, And heard him thus disclose his mind; Consider well pray what you do, And think what numbers live in you: If you go drown, your woes to ease, Pray who will keep your lice and fleas? On yours alone their lives depend, With you they live, with you must end. On great folks thus the little live, And in their sunshine bask and thrive: But when those suns no longer shine, The hapless insects droop and pine. Oh Grenville then this tale apply, Nor drown yourself lest I should die: Compassionate your louse's case, And keep your own to save his place. To Mr. Garrick, on his erecting a Temple and Statue to Shakespear. By the Same. ? Viridi in campo signum de marmore ponam Propter aquam, tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat Thamesis, et multâ prætexit arundine ripas; In medio mihi Shakespear erit, templumque tenebit. Virgil. Where yonder trees rise high in cheerful air, Where yonder banks eternal verdure wear, And opening flow'rs diffusing sweets around Paint with their vivid hues the happy ground; While Thames majestic rolls the meads between, And with his silver current crowns the scene; There Garrick, satiate of well-earn'd applause, From crowds, and shouting theatres withdraws: There courts the Muse, turns o'er th'instructive page, And meditates new triumphs for the stage. Thine, Shakespear, chief—for thou must ever shine His pride, his boast, unequal'd and divine. There too thy vot'ry to thy merit just, Hath rais'd the dome, and plac'd the honour'd bust, Bidding the pile to future times proclaim His veneration for thy mighty name. A place more fit his zeal could never find Than this fair spot, an emblem of thy mind— As hill and dale there charm the wond'ring eye, Such sweet variety thy scenes supply— Like the tall trees sublime thy genius tow'rs, Sprightly thy fancy, as the opening flow'rs, While copious as the tide Thames pours along, Flow the sweet numbers of thy heav'nly song, Serenely pure, and yet divinely strong— Look down, great shade, with pride this tribute see, The hand that pays it makes it worthy thee— As fam'd Apelles was allow'd alone To paint the form august of Philip's son, None but a Garrick can, O bard divine! Lay a fit offering on thy hallow'd shrine. To speak thy worth is his peculiar boast, He best can tell it, for he feels it most. Blest bard! thy fame thro' ev'ry age shall grow, Till nature cease to charm, or Thames to flow. Thou too, with him, whose fame thy talents raise, Shalt share our wonder, and divide our praise; Blended with his thy merits rise to view, And half thy Shakespear's fame to thee is due: Unless the actor with the bard conspire, How impotent his strength, how faint his fire! One boasts the mine, one brings the gold to light, And the muse triumphs in the actor's might; Too weak to give her own conceptions birth, Till all-expressive action call them forth. Thus the sweet pipe, mute in itself, no sound Sends forth, nor breathes its pleasing notes around; But if some swain with happy skill endu'd, Inspire with animating breath the wood, Wak'd into voice, it pours its tuneful strains, And harmony divine enchants the plains. Quod spiro, et placeo, si placeo tuum est— Hor. On the Birth-Day of Shakespear. A Cento. Taken from his Works. By the Same. Naturâ ipsâ valere, et mentis viribus excitari, et quasi quodam divino spiritu afflari. Cicero. —Peace to this meeting, Joy and fair time, health and good wishes! Now, worthy friends, the cause why we are met, Is in celebration of the day that gave Immortal Shakespear to this favour'd isle, The most replenished sweet work of nature, Which from the prime creation e'er she fram'd. O thou divinest nature! how thyself thou blazon'st In this thy son! form'd in thy prodigality, To hold thy mirror up, and give the time, Its very form and pressure! When he speaks Each aged ear plays truant at his tales, And younger hearings are quite ravished, So voluble is his discourse—Gentle As Zephyr blowing underneath the violet, Not wagging its sweet head—yet as rough, (His noble blood enchaff'd) as the rude wind, That by the top doth take the mountain pine, And make him stoop to th'vale.—'Tis wonderful That an invisible instinct should frame him To Royalty, unlearn'd; honour untaught; Civility not seen in other; knowledge That wildly grows in him, but yields a crop As if it had been sown. What a piece of work! How noble in faculty! infinite in reason! A combination and a form indeed, Where every God did seem to set his seal. Heav'n has him now—yet let our idolatrous fancy Still sanctify his relicts; and this day Stand aye distinguish'd in the kalendar To the last syllable of recorded time: For if we take him but for all in all We ne'er shall look upon his like again. An Ode to SCULPTURE. Led by the Muse, my step pervades The sacred haunts, the peaceful shades, Where Art and Sculpture reign: I see, I see, at their command, The living stones in order stand, And marble breathe through ev'ry vein! Time breaks his hostile scythe; he sighs To find his pow'r malignant fled; “And what avails my dart, he cried, “Since these can animate the dead? “Since wak'd to mimic life, again in stone “The patriot seems to speak, the heroe frown?” There Virtue's silent train are seen, Fast fix'd their looks, erect their mien. Lo! while, with more than stoic soul, The Socrates, who was condemned to die by poison. Attic sage exhausts the bowl, A pale suffusion shades his eyes, Till by degrees the marble dies! See there the injur'd Seneca, born at Corduba, who, according to Pliny, was orator, poet, and philosopher. He bled to death in the bath. poet bleed! Ah! see he droops his languid head! What starting nerves, what dying pain, What horror freezes ev'ry vein! These are thy works, O Sculpture! thine to shew In rugged rock a feeling sense of woe. Yet not alone such themes demand The Phydian stroke, the Dædal hand; I view with melting eyes A softer scene of grief display'd, While from her breast the duteous maid Her infant sire with food supplies. In pitying stone she weeps, to see His squalid hair, and galling chains: And trembling, on her bended knee, His hoary head her hand sustains; While ev'ry look, and sorrowing feature prove, How soft her breast, how great her filial love. Lo! there the wild Semiramis, cum ei circa cultum capitis sui occupatæ nunciatum esset Babylonem defecisse; alterâ parte crinium adhuc solutâ protinus ad eam expugnandum cucurrit: nec prius decorum capillorum in ordinem quam tantam urbem in potestatem suam redegit: quocircà statua ejus Babylone posita est, &amp;c. Val. Max. de Ira. Assyrian queen, With threat'ning brow, and frantic mien! Revenge! revenge! the marble cries, While fury sparkles in her eyes. Thus was her aweful form beheld, When Babylon's proud sons rebell'd; She left the woman's vainer care, And flew with loose dishevell'd hair; She stretch'd her hand, imbru'd in blood, While pale Sedition trembling stood; In sudden silence, the mad crowd obey'd Her aweful voice, and Stygian Discord fled! With hope, or fear, or love, by turns, The marble leaps, or shrinks, or burns, As Sculpture waves her hand; The varying passions of the mind Her faithful handmaids are assign'd, And rise and fall by her command. When now life's wasted lamps expire, When sinks to dust this mortal frame, She, like Prometheus, grasps the fire; Her touch revives the lambent flame; While phœnix-like, the statesman, bard, or sage, Spring fresh to life, and breathe through every age. Hence, where the organ full and clear, With loud hosannas charms the ear, Behold (a prism within his hands) Absorb'd in thought, great A noble statue of Sir Isaac Newton, erected in Trinity College chapel, by Dr. Smith. Newton stands; Such was his solemn wonted state, His serious brow, and musing gait, When, taught on eagles-wings to fly, He trac'd the wonders of the sky; The chambers of the sun explor'd, Where tints of thousand hues are stor'd; Whence every flower in painted robes is drest, And varying Iris steals her gaudy vest. Here, as Devotion, heavenly queen, Conducts her best, her fav'rite train, At Newton's shrine they bow! And while with raptur'd eyes they gaze, With Virtue's purest vestal rays, Behold their ardent bosoms glow! Hail, mighty mind! hail, aweful name! I feel inspir'd my lab'ring breast; And lo! I pant, I burn for fame! Come, Science, bright etherial guest, Oh come, and lead thy meanest, humblest son, Through Wisdom's arduous paths to fair renown. Could I to one faint ray aspire, One spark of that celestial fire, The leading cynosure, that glow'd While Smith explor'd the dark abode, Where Wisdom sate on Nature's shrine, How great my boast! what praise were mine! Illustrious sage! who first could'st tell Wherein the power of Music dwell; And ev'ry magic chain untie, That binds the soul of Harmony! To thee, when mould'ring in the dust, To thee shall swell the breathing bust: Shall here (for this reward thy merits claim) “Stand next in place to Newton, as in fame.” True RESIGNATION. By Mr. H? Æquam memento rebus in arduis Servare mentem. Horat. When Colin's good dame, who long held him a tug, And defeated his hopes by the help of the jug, Had taken too freely the cheeruping cup, And repeated the dose till it laid her quite up; Colin sent for the doctor: with sorrowful face He gave him his fee, and he told him her case. Quoth Galen, I'll do what I can for your wife; But indeed she's so bad, that I fear for her life. In counsel there's safety—e'en send for another; For if she shou'd die, folks will make a strange pother, And say that I lost her for want of good skill— Or of better advice—or, in short, what they will. Says Colin, your judgment there's none can dispute; And if physic can cure her—I know yours will do't. But if, after all, she shou'd happen to die, And they say that you kill'd her—I'll swear 'tis a lye: 'Tis the husband's chief business, whatever ensue; And whoever finds fault—I'll be shot—if I do. An Epistle from the King of PRUSSIA, to Monsieur Voltaire. 1757. Translated into English. By JOHN GILBERT COOPER, Esq; Voltaire, believe me, were I now In private life's calm station plac'd, Let Heav'n for nature's wants allow, With cold indiff'rence would I view Changing Fortune's winged haste, And laugh at her caprice like you. Th'insipid farce of tedious state, Imperial duty's real weight, The faithless courtier's supple bow, The fickle multitude's caress, And the great Vulgar's Littleness, By long experience well I know; And, tho' a Prince and Poet born, Vain blandishments of glory scorn. For when the ruthless shears of Fate Have cut my life's precarious thread, And rank'd me with th'unconscious dead, What wil't avail that I was great, Or that th'uncertain tongue of Fame In Mem'ry's temple chaunts my name? One blissful moment whilst we live Weighs more than ages of renown; What then do Potentates receive Of good, peculiarly their own? Sweet Ease and unaffected Joy, Domestic Peace, and sportive Pleasure, The regal throne and palace fly, And, born for liberty, prefer Soft silent scenes of lovely leisure, To, what we Monarchs buy so dear, The thorny pomp of scepter'd care. My pain or bliss shall ne'er depend On fickle Fortune's casual flight, For, whether she's my foe or friend, In calm repose I'll pass the night; And ne'er by watchful homage own I court her smile, or fear her frown. But from our stations we derive Unerring precepts how to live, And certain deeds each rank calls forth, By which is measur'd human worth. Voltaire, within his private cell In realms where ancient honesty Is patrimonial property, And sacred Freedom loves to dwell, May give up all his peaceful mind, Guided by Plato's deathless page, In silent solitude resign'd To the mild virtues of a Sage; But I, 'gainst whom wild whirlwinds wage Fierce war with wreck-denouncing wing, Must be, to face the tempest's rage, In thought, in life, in death a king. At seeing John Williams was consecrated bishop of Lincoln, November 11. 1621. was translated to York December 4. 1641, and died March 25. 1649. and was buried at Landegay near Bangor. Archbishop William's Monument in Carnarvonshire. In that remote and solitary place, Which the seas wash, and circling hills embrace, Where those lone walls amid the groves arise, All that remains of thee, fam'd Williams, lies. Thither, sequester'd shade, creation's nook, The wand'ring Muse her pensive journey took, Curious to trace the statesman to his home, And moralize at leisure o'er his tomb: She came not, with the pilgrim, tears to shed, Mutter a vow, or trifle with a bead, But such a sadness did her thoughts employ, As lives within the neighbourhood of joy. Reflecting much upon the mighty shade, His glories, and his miseries, she said: “How poor the lot of the once-honour'd dead! Perhaps the dust is Williams, that we tread. The learn'd, ambitious, politic, and great, Statesman, and prelate, this alas! thy fate. Cou'd not thy Lincoln yield her pastor room, Cou'd not thy York supply thee with a tomb? Was it for this thy lofty genius soar'd, Caress'd by monarchs and by crowds ador'd? For this, thy hand o'er rivals cou'd prevail, Grasping by turns the crosier and the He was made lord keeper of the great seal July 20. 1621. seal? Who dar'd on Laud's meredian pow'r to frown, And on aspiring Buckingham look down. This thy gay morn,—but ere the day decline Clouds gather, and adversity is thine. Doom'd to behold thy country's fierce alarms, What had thy trembling age to do with arms? Thy lands dragoon'd, thy palaces in dust, Why was thy life protracted to be curst? Thy king in chains,—thyself by lawless might Strip't of all pow'r, and exil'd from thy right. Awhile the venerable hero stood, And stemm'd with quiv'ring limbs the boist'rous flood; At length, o'er-match'd by injuries and time, Stole from the world and sought his native clime. Cambria for him with moans her region fills: She wept his downfal from a thousand hills: Tender embrac'd her prelate tho' undone, Stretch'd out her mother-rocks to hide her son: Search'd, while alive, each vale for his repast, And, when he died, receiv'd him in her breast. Envied Ambition! what are all thy schemes, But waking misery, or pleasing dreams, Sliding and tottering on the heights of state! The subject of this verse declares thy fate. Great as he was, you see how small the gain, A burial so obscure, a Muse so mean. Extempore Verses upon a Trial of Skill between the two great Masters of Defence, Messieurs Figg and Sutton. By Dr. BYROM. I Long was the great Figg, by the prize-fighting swains, Sole monarch acknowledg'd of Mary-bone plains: To the towns, far and near, did his valour extend, And swam down the river from Thame to Gravesend; Where liv'd Mr. Sutton, pipemaker by trade, Who hearing that Figg was thought such a stout blade, Resolv'd to put in for a share of his fame, And so sent to challenge the champion of Thame. II With alternate advantage two trials had past, When they fought out the rubbers on Wednesday last. To see such a contest the house was so full There hardly was room left to thrust in your skull. With a prelude of cudgells we first were saluted, And two or three shoulders most handsomely fluted; Till weary at last with inferior disasters, All the company cry'd, come, the masters, the masters. III Whereupon the bold Sutton first mounted the stage, Made his honours as usual, and yearn'd to engage; Then Figg, with a visage so fierce, yet sedate, Came, and enter'd the lists, with his fresh-shaven pate; Their arms were encircled with armigers too, With a red ribbon Sutton's, and Figg's with a blue. Thus adorn'd the two heroes, 'twixt shoulder, and elbow, Shook hands, and went to 't, and the word it was Bilboe. IV Sure such a concern in the eyes of spectators, Was never yet seen in our amphi-theatres. Our commons and peers from their several places, To half an inch distance all pointed their faces; While the rays of old Phœbus, that shot thro' the sky-light, Seem'd to make on the stage a new kind of twilight; And the Gods without doubt, if one cou'd but have seen 'em, Were peeping there thro' to do justice between 'em. V Figg struck the first stroke, and with such a vast fury, That he broke his huge weapon in twain, I assure you; And if his brave rival this blow had not warded, His head from his shoulders had quite been discarded. Figg arm'd him again, and they took t'other tilt, And then Sutton's blade ran away from its hilt; The weapons were frighted, but as for the men, In truth they ne'er minded, but at it again. VI Such a force in their blows, you'd have thought it a wonder Every stroke they receiv'd did not cleave 'em asunder. Yet so great was their courage, so equal their skill, That they both seem'd as safe as a thief in a mill; While in doubtful attention dame Victory stood, And which side to take cou'd not tell for her blood, But remain'd like the ass, 'twixt the bundles of hay, Without ever stirring an inch either way. VII Till Jove to the Gods signified his intention In a speech that he made 'em too tedious to mention; But the upshot on 't was, that at that very bout, From a wound in Figg's side the hot blood spouted out; Her ladyship then seem'd to think the case plain, But Figg stepping forth with a sullen disdain, Shew'd the gash, and appeal'd to the company round, If his own broken sword had not given him the wound. VIII That bruises, and wounds a man's spirit shou'd touch, With danger so little, with honour so much! Well, they both took a dram, and return'd to the battle, And with a fresh fury they made the swords rattle; While Sutton's right arm was observed to bleed, By a touch from his rival, so Jove had decreed; Just enough for to shew that his blood was not icor, But made up, like Figg's, of the common red-liquor. IX Again they both rush'd with as equal a fire on, 'Till the company cry'd, hold, enough of cold iron, To the quarter-staff now, lads. So first having dram'd it, They took to their woods, and i' faith never sham'd it. The first bout they had was so fair, and so handsome, That to make a fair bargain, was worth a king's ransom; And Sutton such bangs on his neighbour imparted, Wou'd have made any fibres but Figg's to have smarted. X Then after that bout they went on to another— But the matter must end on some fashion, or other; So Jove told the Gods he hath made a decree, That Figg shou'd hit Sutton a stroke on the knee. Tho' Sutton disabled as soon as he hit him Wou'd still have fought on, but Jove wou'd not permit him; 'Twas his fate, not his fault, that constrain'd him to yield, And thus the great Figg became lord of the field. A Letter from Cambridge to a young Gentleman at Eton School. By Dr. LITTLETON. Tho' plagu'd with algebraic lectures, And astronomical conjectures, Wean'd from the sweets of poetry To scraps of dry philosophy, You see, dear sir, I've found a time T'express my thoughts to you in rhime. For why, my friend, shou'd distant parts, Or times, disjoin united hearts, Since, tho' by intervening space Depriv'd of speaking face to face, By faithful emissary letter We may converse as well, or better? And not to stretch a narrow fancy, To shew what pretty things I can say, (As some will strain at simile, First work it fine, and then apply; Tag Butler's rhimes to Prior's thoughts, And chuse to mimic all their faults, By head and shoulders bring in a stick, To shew their knack at hudibrastic,) I'll tell you as a friend, and crony, How here I spend my time, and money; For time, and money, go together As sure as weathercock, and weather; And thrifty guardians all allow This grave reflection to be true, That whilst we pay so dear for learning Those weighty truths we've no concern in, The spark who squanders time away In vain pursuits, and fruitless play, Not only proves an arrant blockhead, But, what's much worse, is out of pocket. Whether my conduct bad, or good is, Judge from the nature of my studies. No more majestic Virgil's heights, Nor tow'ring Milton's loftier flights, Nor courtly Flaceus's rebukes, Who banters vice with friendly jokes, Nor Congreve's life, nor Cowley's fire, Nor all the beauties that conspire To place the greenest bays upon Th'immortal brows of Addison; Prior's inimitable ease, Nor Pope's harmonious numbers please; Homer indeed (for critics shew it) Was both philosopher, and poet, But tedious philosophic chapters Quite stifle my poetic raptures, And I to Phœbus bade adieu When first I took my leave of you. Now algebra, geometry, Arithmetic, astronomy, Optics, chronology, and statics, All tiresome parts of mathematics; With twenty harder names than these Disturb my brain, and break my peace. All seeming inconsistencies Are nicely solv'd by a's, and b's; Our eye-sight is disprov'd by prisms, Our arguments by syllogisms. If I shou'd confidently write This ink is black, this paper white, Or, to express myself yet fuller, Shou'd say that black, or white's a colour; They'd contradict it, and perplex one With motion, rays, and their reflexion, And solve th'apparent falsehood by The curious texture of the eye. Shou'd I the poker want, and take it, When't looks as hot, as fire can make it, And burn my finger, and my coat, They'd flatly tell me, 'tis not hot; The fire, say they, has in't, 'tis true, The pow'r of causing heat in you; But no more heat's in fire that heats you, Than there is pain in stick that beats you. Thus too philosophers expound The names of odour, taste, and sound; The salts, and juices in all meat Affect the tongues of them that eat, And by some secret poignant power Give them the taste of sweet, and sour. Carnations, violets, and roses Cause a sensation in our noses; But then there's none of us can tell The things themselves have taste, or smell. So when melodious Mason sings, Or Gethring tunes the trembling strings, Or when the trumpet's brisk alarms Call forth the cheerful youth to arms, Convey'd thro' undulating air The music's only in the ear. We're told how planets roll on high, How large their orbits, and how nigh; I hope in little time to know Whether the moon's a cheefe, or no; Whether the man in't, as some tell ye, With beef and carrots fills his belly; Why like a lunatic confin'd He lives at distance from mankind; When he at one good hearty shake, Might whirl his prison off his back; Or like a maggot in a nut Full bravely eat his passage out. Who knows what vast discoveries From such inquiries might arise? But feuds, and tumults in the nation Disturb such curious speculation. Cambridge from furious broils of state, Foresees her near-approaching fate; Her surest patrons are remov'd, And her triumphant foes approv'd. No more! this due to friendship take, Not idly writ for writing's sake; No longer question my respect, Nor call this short delay neglect; At least excuse it, when you see This pledge of my sincerity; For one who rhimes to make you easy, And his invention strains to please you, To shew his friendship cracks his brains, Sure is a mad-man if he feigns. The INDOLENT. The attribution of this poem is questionable. What self-sufficiency and false content Benumb the senses of the indolent! Dead to all purposes of good, or ill, Alive alone in an unactive will. His only vice in no good action lies, And his sole virtue is his want of vice. Business he deems too hard, trifles too easy, And doing nothing finds himself too busy. Silence he cannot bear, noise is distraction, Noise kills with bustle, silence with reflection; No want he feels,—what has he to pursue? To him 'tis less to suffer, than to do. The busy world's a fool, the learn'd a sot, And his sole hope to be by all forgot: Wealth is procur'd with toil, and kept with fear, Knowledge by labour purchas'd costs too dear; Friendship's a clog, and family a jest, A wife but a bad bargain at the best; Honour a bubble, subject to a breath, And all engagements vain since null'd by death; Thus all the wise esteem, he can despise, And caring not, 'tis he alone is wise: Yet, all his wish possessing, finds no rest, And only lives to know, he never can be blest. The Song of Simeon paraphrased. By Mr. MERRICK. 'Tis enough—the hour is come. Now within the silent tomb Let this mortal frame decay, Mingled with its kindred clay; Since thy mercies oft of old By thy chosen seers foretold, Faithful now and stedfast prove, God of truth and God of love! Since at length my aged eye Sees the day-spring from on high. Son of righteousness, to thee Lo! the nations bow the knee, And the realms of distant kings Own the healing of thy wings. Those whom death had overspread With his dark and dreary shade, Lift their eyes, and from afar Hail the light of Jacob's star; Waiting till the promis'd ray Turn their darkness into day. See the beams intensely shed Shine o'er Sion's favour'd head. Never may they hence remove, God of truth and God of love! On the Invention of Letters. Tell me what Genius did the art invent, The lively image of the voice to paint; Who first the secret how to colour sound, And to give shape to reason, wisely found; With bodies how to cloath ideas, taught; And how to draw the picture of a thought: Who taught the hand to speak, the eye to hear A silent language roving far and near; Whose softest noise outstrips loud thunder's sound, And spreads her accents thro' the world's vast round: A voice heard by the deaf, spoke by the dumb, Whose echo reaches long, long time to come; Which dead men speak as well as those alive— Tell me what Genius did this art contrive. The Answer. The noble art to Cadmus owes its rise, Of painting words, and speaking to the eyes; He first in wond'rous magic fetters bound The airy voice, and stop'd the flying sound: The various figures by his pencil wrought, Gave colour, form, and body to the thought. On WIT. True wit is like the brilliant stone Dug from the Indian mine; Which boasts two various powers in one To cut as well as shine. Genius, like that, if polish'd right, With the same gifts abounds; Appears at once both keen and bright, And sparkles while it wounds. On a SPIDER. Artist, who underneath my table Thy curious texture hast display'd; Who, if we may believe the fable, Wert once a fair ingenious maid: Insidious, restless, watchful spider, Fear no officious damsel's broom, Extend thy artful fabric wider, And spread thy banners round my room. Swept from the rich man's costly ceiling, Thou'rt welcome to my homely roof; Here may'st thou find a peaceful dwelling, And undisturb'd attend thy woof. Whilst I thy wond'rous fabric stare at, And think on hapless poet's fate; Like thee confin'd to lonely garret, And rudely banish'd rooms of state. And as from out thy tortur'd body Thou draw'st thy slender string with pain, So does he labour, like a noddy, To spin materials from his brain. He for some fluttering tawdry creature, That spreads her charms before his eye; And that's a conquest little better Than thine o'er captive butterfly. Thus far 'tis plain we both agree, Perhaps our deaths may better shew it; 'Tis ten to one but penury Ends both the spider and the poet. The Play-Thing chang'd. Kitty's charming voice and face, Syren-like, first caught my fancy; Wit and humour next take place, And now I doat on sprightly Nancy. Kitty tunes her pipe in vain, With airs most languishing and dying; Calls me false ungrateful swain, And tries in vain to shoot me flying. Nancy with resistless art, Always humourous, gay, and witty; Has talk'd herself into my heart, And quite excluded tuneful Kitty. Ah Kitty! Love, a wanton boy, Now pleas'd with song, and now with prattle, Still longing for the newest toy, Has chang'd his whistle for a rattle. The Fable of JOTHAM: To the Borough-Hunters.

Tho' much they discours'd, the long way to beguile, Of the earthquakes, the Jews, and the change of the stile, Of the Irish, the stocks, and the lott'ry committee, They came silent and tir'd into Exeter city. “Some books, prithee landlord, to pass a dull hour; “No nonsense of parsons, or methodists four, “No poetical stuff—a damn'd jingle of rhimes, “But some pamphlet that's new, and a touch on the times.” “O Lord! says mine host, you may hunt the town round, “I question if any such thing can be found: “I never was ask'd for a book by a guest; “And I'm sure I have all the great folk in the West. “None of these to my knowledge e'er call'd for a book; “But see, Sir, the woman with fish, and the cook; “Here's the fattest of carp, shall we dress you a brace? “Would you have any soals, or a mullet, or plaice?” “A place, quoth the knight, we must have to be sure, “But first let us see that our borough's secure, “We'll talk of the place when we've settled the poll: “They may dress us for supper the mullet and soal. “But do you, my good landlord, look over your shelves, “For a book we must have, we're so tired of ourselves.” “In troth, Sir, I ne'er had a book in my life, “But the prayer book and bible I bought for my wife.” “Well! the bible must do; but who don't you take in “Some monthly collection? the new magazine?” The bible was brought and laid out on the table, And open'd at Jotham's most apposite fable. Sir Freeport began with this verse, tho' no rhime— “The trees of the forest went forth on a time, (To what purpose our candidates scarce could expect, For it was not, they found, to transplant—but elect) “To the olive and fig-tree their deputies came, “But by both were refus'd, and their answer the same: “Quoth the olive, shall I leave my fatness and oil “For an unthankful office, a dignified toil? “Shall I leave, quoth the fig-tree, my sweetness and fruit, “To be envy'd, or slav'd in so vain a pursuit? “Thus rebuff'd and surpriz'd they apply'd to the vine, “He answer'd: shall I leave my grapes and my wine, “(Wine the sovereign cordial of god and of man) “To be made or the tool or the head of a clan? “At last, as it always falls out in a scramble, “The mob gave the cry for a bramble! a bramble! “A bramble for ever! O! chance unexpected! “But bramble prevail'd and was duly elected.” “O! ho! quoth the knight with a look most profound, “Now I see there's some good in good books to be found. “I wish I had read this same bible before: “Of long miles at the least 'twould have sav'd us fourscore. “You, Plumb, with your olives and oil might have staid, “And myself might have tarried my wines to unlade. “What have merchants to do from their business to ramble! “Your electioneer-errant should still be a bramble.” Thus ended at once the wise comment on Jotham, And our citizens' jaunt to the borough of Gotham. An Elegy written in an empty Assembly-Room. By the Same. ? Semperque relinqui Sola sibi ? Virg. In scenes where Hallet's genius has combin'd With Bromwich to amuse and cheer the mind; Amid this pomp of cost, this pride of art, What mean these sorrows in a female heart? Ye crowded walls, whose well-enlighten'd round With lovers sighs and protestations sound, Ye pictures flatter'd by the learn'd and wise, Ye glasses ogled by the brightest eyes, Ye cards, which beauties by their touch have blest, Ye chairs, which peers and ministers have prest, How are ye chang'd! like you my fate I moan, Like you, alas! neglected and alone— For ah! to me alone no card is come, I must not go abroad—and cannot be at home. Blest be that social pow'r, the first who pair'd The erring footman with th'unerring card. 'Twas Venus sure; for by their faithful aid The whisp'ring lover meets the blushing maid: From solitude they give the cheerful call To the choice supper, or the sprightly ball: Speed the soft summons of the gay and fair, From distant Bloomsbury to Grosvenor's square; And bring the colonel to the tender hour, From the parade, the senate, or the Tower. Ye records, patents of our worth and pride! Our daily lesson, and our nightly guide! Where'er ye stand dispos'd in proud array, The vapours vanish, and the heart is gay; But when no cards the chimney-glass adorn, The dismal void with heart-felt shame we mourn; Conscious neglect inspires a sullen gloom, And brooding sadness fills the slighted room. If but some happier female's card I've seen, I swell with rage, or sicken with the spleen; While artful pride conceals the bursting tear, With some forc'd banter or affected sneer: But now grown desp'rate, and beyond all hope, I curse the ball, the d?ss, and the pope. And as the loads of borrow'd plate go by, Tax it! ye greedy ministers, I cry. How shall I feel, when Sol resigns his light To this proud splendid goddess of the night! Then when her aukward guests in measure beat The crowded floors, which groan beneath their feet! What thoughts in solitude shall then possess My tortur'd mind, or soften my distress! Not all that envious malice can suggest Will sooth the tumults of my raging breast. (For Envy's lost amid the numerous train, And hisses with her hundred snakes in vain) Though with contempt each despicable soul Singly I view,—I must revere the whole. The methodist in her peculiar lot, The world forgetting, by the world forgot, Though single happy, tho' alone is proud, She thinks of heav'n (she thinks not of a crowd) And if she ever feels a vap'rish qualm, Some The title of a book of modern devotion. drop of honey, or some holy balm, The pious prophet of her sect distils, And her pure soul seraphic rapture fills; Grace shines around her with serenest beams, And whisp'ring W? prompts her golden dreams. Far other dreams my sensual soul employ, While conscious nature tastes unholy joy: I view the traces of experienc'd charms, And clasp the regimentals in my arms. To dream last night I clos'd my blubber'd eyes; Ye soft illusions, dear deceits arise; Alas! no more; methinks I wand'ring go To distant quarters 'midst the Highland snow: To the dark inn where never wax-light burns, Where in smoak'd tap'stry faded Dido mourns; To some assembly in a country town, And meet the colonel—in a parson's gown— I start—I shriek— O! could I on my waking brain impose, Or but forget at least my present woes! Forget 'em—how!—each rattling coach suggests The loath'd ideas of the crowding guests. To visit—were to publish my disgrace; To meet the spleen in ev'ry other place; To join old maids and dowagers forlorn; And be at once their comfort and their scorn! For once, to read with this distemper'd brain, Ev'n modern novels lend their aid in vain. My Mandoline—what place can music find Amid the discord of my restless mind? How shall I waste this time which slowly flies! How lull to slumber my reluctant eyes! This night the happy and th'unhappy keep Vigils alike,—N? has murder'd sleep. The FAKEER: A Tale. By the Same. A Fakeer (a religious well known in the East, Not much like a parson, still less like a priest) With no canting, no sly jesuitical arts, Field-preaching, hypocrisy, learning, or parts; By a happy refinement in mortification, Grew the oracle, saint, and the pope of his nation. But what did he do this esteem to acquire? Did he torture his head or his bosom with fire? Was his neck in a portable pillory cas'd? Did he fasten a chain to his leg or his waist? No. His holiness rose to this sovereign pitch By the merit of running long nails in his breech. A wealthy young Indian, approaching the shrine, Thus in banter accosts the prophetic divine. This tribute accept for your int'rest with FO, Whom with torture you serve, and whose will you must know; To your suppliant disclose his immortal decree; Tell me which of the heav'ns is allotted for me. Fakeer. Let me first know your merits. Indian. I strive to be just: To be true to my friend, to my wife, to my trust: In religion I duly observe ev'ry form: With an heart to my country devoted and warm: I give to the poor, and I lend to the rich— Fakeer. But how many nails do you run in your breech? Indian. With submission I speak to your rev'rence's tail; But mine has no taste for a ten-penny nail. Fakeer. Well! I'll pray to our prophet and get you prefer'd; Though no farther expect than to heaven the third. With me in the thirtieth your seat to obtain, You must qualify duly with hunger and pain. Indian. With you in the thirtieth! you impudent rogue! Can such wretches as you give to madness a vogue! Though the priesthood of FO on the vulgar impose, By squinting whole years at the end of their nose, Though with cruel devices of mortification They adore a vain idol of modern creation, Does the God of the heav'ns such a service direct? Can his mercy approve a self-punishing sect? Will his wisdom be worship'd with chains and with nails? Or e'er look for his rites in your noses and tails? Come along to my house and these penances leave, Give your belly a feast, and your breech a reprieve. This reas'ning unhing'd each fanatical notion; And stagger'd our saint in his chair of promotion. At length with reluctance he rose from his seat: And resigning his nails and his fame for retreat, Two weeks his new life he admir'd and enjoy'd: The third he with plenty and quiet was cloy'd. To live undistinguish'd to him was the pain, An existence unnotic'd he could not sustain. In retirement he sigh'd for the fame-giving chair: For the crowd to admire him, to rev'rence and stare: No endearments of pleasure and ease could prevail; He the saintship resum'd, and new larded his tail. Our Fakeer represents all the vot'ries of fame; Their ideas, their means, and their end is the same: The sportsman, the buck; all the heroes of vice, With their gallantry, lewdness, the bottle and dice; The poets, the critics, the metaphysicians, The courtier, the patriot, all politicians; The statesman begirt with th'importunate ring, (I had almost compleated my list with the king) All labour alike to illustrate my tale; All tortur'd by choice with th'invisible nail. To Mr. WHITEHEAD, On his being made Poet Laureat. By the Same. 'Tis so—tho' we're surpriz'd to hear it: The laurel is bestow'd on merit. How hush'd is ev'ry envious voice! Confounded by so just a choice, Tho' by prescriptive right prepar'd To libel the selected bard. But as you see the statesman's fate In this our democratic state, Whom virtue strives in vain to guard From the rude pamphlet and the card; You'll find the demagogues of Pindus In envy not a jot behind us: For each Aonian politician (Whose element is opposition,) Will shew how greatly they surpass us, In gall and wormwood at Parnassus. Thus as the same detracting spirit Attends on all distinguish'd merit, When 'tis your turn, observe, the quarrel Is not with you, but with the laurel. Suppose that laurel on your brow, For cypress chang'd, funereal bough! See all things take a diff'rent turn! The very critics sweetly mourn, And leave their satire's pois'nous sting In plaintive elegies to sing: With solemn threnody and dirge Conduct you to Elysium's verge. At Westminster the surplic'd dean The sad but honorable scene Prepares. The well-attended herse Bears you amid the kings of verse. Each rite observ'd, each duty paid, Your fame on marble is display'd, With symbols which your genius suit, The mask, the buskin, and the flute: The laurel crown aloft is hung: And o'er the sculptur'd lyre unstrung Sad allegoric figures leaning— (How folks will gape to find their meaning!) And a long epitaph is spread, Which happy you will never read. But hold—The change is so inviting I own, I tremble while I'm writing. Yet, Whitehead, 'tis too soon to lose you: Let critics flatter or abuse you, O! teach us, e'er you change the scene To Stygian banks from Hippocrene, How free-born bards should strike the strings, And how a Briton write to kings. Verses on the Prospect of planting Arts and Learning in America. By the late Dr. Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne. The Muse, disgusted at an age and clime, Barren of every glorious theme, In distant lands now waits a better time, Producing subjects worthy fame: In happy climes, where from the genial sun And virgin earth such scenes ensue, The force of art by nature seems outdone, And fancied beauties by the true: In happy climes the seat of innocence, Where nature guides and virtue rules, Where men shall not impose for truth and sense The pedantry of courts and schools: There shall be sung another golden age, The rise of empire and of arts, The good and great inspiring epic rage, The wisest heads and noblest hearts. Not such as Europe breeds in her decay; Such as she bred when fresh and young, When heav'nly flame did animate her clay, By future poets shall be sung. Westward the course of empire takes its way; The four first acts already past, A fifth shall close the drama with the day; Time's noblest offspring is the last. To Mr. MASON. By WILLIAM WHITEHEAD, Esq; I. Believe me, Mason, 'tis in vain Thy fortitude the torrent braves; Thou too must bear th'inglorious chain; The world, the world will have its slaves. The chosen friend, for converse sweet, The small, yet elegant retreat, Are peaceful unambitious views Which early fancy loves to form, When aided by th'ingenuous Muse, She turns the philosophic page, And sees the wise of every age With Nature's dictates warm. II. But ah! to few has Fortune given The choice, to take or to refuse; To fewer still indulgent Heaven Allots the very will to chuse. And why are varying schemes prefer'd? Man mixes with the common herd, By custom guided to pursue Or wealth, or honors, fame, or ease; What others wish he wishes too, Nor, from his own peculiar choice, 'Till strengthen'd by the public voice, His very pleasures please. III. How oft, beneath some hoary shade Where Cam glides indolently slow, Hast thou, as indolently laid, Prefer'd to Heav'n thy fav'rite vow: “Here, here forever let me stay, “Here calmly loiter life away, “Nor all those vain connections know “Which fetter down the free-born mind “The slave of interest, or of shew; “Whilst yon gay tenant of the grove, “The happier heir of Nature's love, “Can warble unconfin'd.” IV. Yet sure, my friend, th'eternal plan By truth unerring was design'd; Inferior parts were made for man, But man himself for all mankind. Then by th'apparent judge th'unseen; Behold how rolls this vast machine To one great end, howe'er withstood, Directing its impartial course. All labour for the general good. Some stem the wave, some till the soil, By choice the bold, th'ambitious toil, The indolent by force. V. That bird, thy fancy frees from care, With many a fear, unknown to thee, Must rove to glean his scanty fare From field to field, from tree to tree: His lot, united with his kind, Has all his little joys confin'd; The Lover's and the Parent's ties Alarm by turns his anxious breast; Yet, bound by fate, by instinct wise, He hails with songs the rising morn, And pleas'd at evening's cool return He sings himself to rest. VI. And tell me, has not nature made Some stated void for thee to fill, Some spring, some wheel which asks thy aid To move, regardless of thy will? Go then, go feel with glad surprize New bliss from new connections rise; 'Till, happier in thy wider sphere, Thou quit thy darling schemes of ease; Nay, glowing in the full career Ev'n wish thy virtuous labours more; Nor 'till the toilsome day is o'er Expect the night of peace. ODE. To INDEPENDENCY. By Mr. MASON. I. Here, on my native shore reclin'd, While Silence rules this midnight hour, I woo thee, Goddess. On my musing mind Descend, propitious Power! And bid these ruffling gales of grief subside: Bid my calm'd soul with all thy influence shine; As yon chaste Orb along this ample tide Draws the long lustre of her silver line, While the hush'd breeze its last weak whisper blows, And lulls old Humber to his deep repose. II. Come to thy Vot'ry's ardent pray'r, In all thy graceful plainness drest; No knot confines thy waving hair, No zone thy floating vest. Unsullied Honor decks thine open brow, And Candor brightens in thy modest eye: Thy blush is warm Content's ætherial glow, Thy smile is Peace; thy step is Liberty: Thou scatter'st blessings round with lavish hand, As Spring with careless fragrance fills the land. III. As now o'er this lone beach I stray; Thy Andrew Marvell, born at Kingston upon Hull in the Year 1620. fav'rite Swain oft stole along, And artless wove his Doric lay, Far from the busy throng, Thou heard'st him, Goddess, strike the tender string, And badst his soul with bolder passions move: Strait these responsive shores forgot to ring, With Beauty's praise, or plaint of slighted Love; To loftier flights his daring Genius rose, And led the war, 'gainst thine, and Freedom's foes. IV. Pointed with Satire's keenest steel, The shafts of Wit he darts around: Ev'n Parker, bishop of Oxford. mitred Dulness learns to feel, And shrinks beneath the wound. In aweful poverty his honest Muse Walks forth vindictive thro' a venal land: In vain Corruption sheds her golden dews, In vain Oppression lifts her iron hand; He scorns them both, and, arm'd with truth alone, Bids Lust and Folly tremble on the throne. V. Behold, like him, immortal Maid, The Muses vestal fires I bring: Here at thy feet the sparks I spread; Propitious wave thy wing, And fan them to that dazzling blaze of Song, That glares tremendous on the Sons of Pride. But, hark, methinks I hear her hallow'd tongue! In distant trills it echos o'er the tide; Now meets mine ear with warbles wildly free, As swells the Lark's meridian ecstacy. VI. “Fond Youth! to Marvell's patriot fame, “Thy humble breast must ne'er aspire. “Yet nourish still the lambent flame; “Still strike thy blameless Lyre: “Led by the moral Muse securely rove; “And all the vernal sweets thy vacant Youth “Can cull from busy Fancy's fairy grove, “O hang their foliage round the fane of Truth: “To arts like these devote thy tuneful toil, “And meet its fair reward in D'Arcy's smile.” VII. “'Tis he, my Son, alone shall cheer “Thy sick'ning soul; at that sad hour, “When o'er a much-lov'd Parent's bier “Thy duteous Sorrows shower: “At that sad hour; when all thy hopes decline; “When pining Care leads on her pallid train, “And sees thee, like the weak, and widow'd Vine, “Winding thy blasted tendrils o'er the plain. “At that sad hour shall D'Arcy lend his aid, “And raise with friendship's arm thy drooping head. VIII. “This fragrant wreath, the Muses meed, “That bloom'd those vocal shades among, “Where never Flatt'ry dared to tread, “Or Interest's servile throng; “Receive, my favour'd Son, at my command, “And keep, with sacred care, for D'Arcy's brow: “Tell him, 'twas wove by my immortal hand, “I breath'd on every flower a purer glow; “Say, for thy sake, I send the gift divine “To him, who calls thee his, yet makes thee mine.” ODE. On MELANCHOLY. To a FRIEND. By the Same. I. Ah! cease this kind persuasive strain, Which, when it flows from friendship's tongue, However weak, however vain, O'erpowers beyond the Siren's song: Leave me, my friend, indulgent go, And let me muse upon my woe. Why lure me from these pale retreats? Why rob me of these pensive sweets? Can Music's voice, can Beauty's eye, Can Painting's glowing hand, supply A charm so suited to my mind, As blows this hollow gust of wind, As drops this little weeping rill Soft-tinkling down the moss-grown hill, Whilst thro' the west, where sinks the crimson Day, Meek Twilight slowly sails, and waves her banners grey? II. Say, from Affliction's various source Do none but turbid waters flow? And cannot Fancy clear their course? For Fancy is the friend of Woe. Say, 'mid that grove, in love-lorn state, When yon poor Ringdove mourns her mate, Is all, that meets the shepherd's ear, Inspir'd by anguish, and despair? Ah no, fair Fancy rules the Song: She swells her throat; she guides her tongue; She bids the waving Aspin-spray Quiver in Cadence to her lay; She bids the fringed Osiers bow, And rustle round the lake below, To suit the tenor of her gurgling sighs, And sooth her throbbing breast with solemn sympathies. III. To thee, whose young and polish'd brow The wrinkling hand of Sorrow spares; Whose cheeks, bestrew'd with roses, know No channel for the tide of tears; To thee yon Abbey dank, and lone, Where Ivy chains each mould'ring stone That nods o'er many a Martyr's tomb, May cast a formidable gloom. Yet some there are, who, free from fear, Could wander thro' the cloysters drear, Could rove each desolated Isle, Tho' midnight thunders shook the pile; And dauntless view, or seem to view, (As faintly flash the lightnings blue) Thin shiv'ring Ghosts from yawning charnels throng, And glance with silent sweep the shaggy vaults along. IV. But such terrific charms as these, I ask not yet: My sober mind The fainter forms of Sadness please; My sorrows are of softer kind. Thro' this still valley let me stray, Wrapt in some strain of pensive Gray: Whose lofty Genius bears along The conscious dignity of Song; And, scorning from the sacred store To waste a note on Pride, or Power, Roves, when the glimmering twilight glooms, And warbles 'mid the rustic tombs: He too perchance (for well I know, His heart would melt with friendly woe) He too perchance, when these poor limbs are laid, Will heave one tuneful sigh, and sooth my hov'ring Shade. ODE. By Mr. GRAY. ???????? ????????? ? Pindar, Olymp. II. I. 1 Awake, Æolian lyre, awake, And give to rapture all thy trembling strings. From Helicon's harmonious springs A thousand rills their mazy progress take: The laughing flowers, that round them blow, Drink life and fragance as they flow. Now the rich stream of music winds along Deep, majestic, smooth and strong, Thro' verdant vales, and Ceres' golden reign: Now rolling down the steep amain, Headlong, impetuous, see it pour: The rocks, and nodding groves rebellow to the roar. 2 Oh! Sovereign of the willing soul, Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs, Enchanting shell! the sullen Cares, And frantic Passions hear thy soft controul. On Thracia's hills the Lord of War Has curb'd the fury of his car, And drop'd his thirsty lance at thy command. Perching on the scept'red hand Of Jove, thy magic lulls the feather'd king With ruffled plumes, and flagging wing: Quench'd in dark clouds of slumber lie The terror of his beak, and light'nings of his eye. 3 Thee the voice, the dance, obey, Temper'd to thy warbled lay. O'er Idalia's velvet-green The rosy-crowned Loves are seen On Cytherea's day, With antic Sports, and blue-eyed Pleasures, Frisking light in frolic measures; Now pursuing, now retreating, Now in circling troops they meet: To brisk notes in cadence beating Glance their many-twinkling feet. Slow melting strains their Queen's approach declare: Where'er she turns the Graces homage pay. With arms sublime, that float upon the air, In gliding state she wins her easy way: O'er her warm cheek, and rising bosom, move The bloom of young Desire, and purple light of Love. II. 1 Man's feeble race what Ills await, Labour, and Penury, the racks of Pain, Disease, and Sorrow's weeping train, And Death, sad refuge from the storms of Fate! The fond complaint, my Song, disprove, And justify the laws of Jove. Say, has he giv'n in vain the heav'nly Muse? Night, and all her sickly dews, Her Spectres wan, and Birds of boding cry, He gives to range the dreary sky: Till down the eastern cliffs afar Hyperion's march they spy, and glitt'ring shafts of war. 2 In climes beyond the solar road, Where shaggy forms o'er ice-built mountains roam, The Muse has broke the twilight-gloom To chear the shiv'ring Native's dull abode. And oft, beneath the od'rous shade Of Chili's boundless forests laid, She deigns to hear the savage Youth repeat, In loose numbers wildly sweet, Their feather-cinctured Chiefs, and dusky Loves. Her track, where'er the Goddess roves, Glory pursue, and generous Shame, Th'unconquerable Mind, and Freedom's holy flame. 3 Woods, that wave o'er Delphi's steep, Isles, that crown th'Egæan deep, Fields, that cool Ilissus laves, Or where Mæander's amber waves In lingering Lab'rinths creep, How do your tuneful Echo's languish, Mute, but to the voice of Anguish! Where each old poetic Mountain Inspiration breath'd around; Ev'ry shade and hallow'd Fountain Murmur'd deep a solemn sound: Till the sad Nine in Greece's evil hour Left their Parnassus for the Latian plains. Alike they scorn the pomp of tyrant-Power, And coward Vice, that revels in her chains. When Latium had her lofty spirit lost, They sought, oh Albion! next, thy sea-encircled coast. III. 1 Far from the sun and summer-gale, In thy green lap was Nature's Darling laid, What time, where lucid Avon stray'd, To Him the mighty Mother did unveil Her aweful face: The dauntless Child Stretch'd forth his little arms, and smil'd. This pencil take (she said) whose colours clear Richly paint the vernal year: Thine too these golden keys, immortal Boy! This can unlock the gates of Joy; Of Horrour that, and thrilling Fears, Or ope the sacred source of sympathetic Tears. 2 Nor second He, that rode sublime Upon the seraph-wings of Extasy, The secrets of th'Abyss to spy. He pass'd the flaming bounds of Place and Time: The living Throne, the saphire-blaze, Where Angels tremble while they gaze, He saw; but blasted with excess of light, Closed his eyes in endless night. Behold, where Dryden's less presumptuous car, Wide o'er the fields of Glory bear Two coursers of ethereal race, With necks in thunder cloath'd, and long-resounding pace. 3 Hark, his hands the lyre explore! Bright-eyed Fancy hovering o'er Scatters from her pictur'd urn Thoughts, that breathe, and words, that burn. But ah! 'tis heard no more— Oh! Lyre divine, what daring Spirit Wakes thee now? tho' he inherit Nor the pride, nor ample pinion, That the Theban Eagle bear Sailing with supreme dominion Thro' the azure deep of air: Yet oft before his infant eyes would run Such forms, as glitter in the Muse's ray With orient hues, unborrow'd of the Sun: Yet shall he mount, and keep his distant way Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate, Beneath the Good how far—but far above the Great. ODE. By the Same. The following Ode is founded on a tradition current in Wales, that Edward the First, when he compleated the conquest of that country, ordered all the Bards, that fell into his hands, to be put to death. I. 1 ‘Ruin seize thee, ruthless King! ‘Confusion on thy banners wait, ‘Tho' fann'd by Conquest's crimson wing ‘They mock the air with idle state. ‘Helm, nor Hauberk's twisted mail, ‘Nor even thy virtues, Tyrant, shall avail ‘To save thy secret soul from nightly fears, ‘From Cambria's curse, from Cambria's tears!’ Such were the sounds, that o'er the crested pride Of the first Edward scatter'd wild dismay, As down the steep of Snowdon's shaggy side He wound with toilsome march his long array. Stout Gloster stood aghast in speechless trance: To arms! cried Mortimer, and couch'd his quiv'ring lance. 2 On a rock, whose haughty brow Frowns o'er old Conway's foaming flood, Robed in the sable garb of woe, With haggard eyes the Poet stood; (Loose his beard, and hoary hair Stream'd, like a meteor, to the troubled air) And with a Master's hand, and Prophet's fire, Struck the deep sorrows of his lyre. ‘Hark, how each giant-oak, and desart cave, ‘Sighs to the torrent's aweful voice beneath! ‘O'er thee, oh King! their hundred arms they wave, ‘Revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe; ‘Vocal no more, since Cambria's fatal day, ‘To high-born Hoel's harp, or soft Llewellyn's lay. 3 ‘Cold is Cadwallo's tongue, ‘That hush'd the stormy main: ‘Brave Urien sleeps upon his craggy bed: ‘Mountains, ye mourn in vain ‘Modred, whose magic song ‘Made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud-top'd head. ‘On dreary Arvon's shore they lie, ‘Smear'd with gore, and ghastly pale: ‘Far, far aloof th'affrighted ravens sail; ‘The famish'd Eagle screams, and passes by. ‘Dear lost companions of my tuneful art, ‘Dear, as the light, that visits these sad eyes, ‘Dear, as the ruddy drops that warm my heart, ‘Ye died amidst your dying country's cries— ‘No more I weep. They do not sleep. ‘On yonder cliffs, a griesly band, ‘I see them sit, they linger yet, ‘Avengers of their native land: ‘With me in dreadful harmony they join, ‘And weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line. II. 1 “Weave the warp, and weave the woof, “The winding-sheet of Edward's race, “Give ample room, and verge enough “The characters of hell to trace. “Mark the year, and mark the night, “When Severn shall re-echo with affright “The shrieks of death, thro' Berkley's roofs that ring, “Shrieks of an agonizing King! “She-Wolf of France, with unrelenting fangs, “That tear'st the bowels of thy mangled Mate, “From thee be born, who o'er thy country hangs “The scourge of Heav'n. What Terrors round him wait! “Amazement in his van, with Flight combin'd, “And Sorrow's faded form, and Solitude behind. 2 “Mighty Victor, mighty Lord, “Low on his funeral couch he lies! “No pitying heart, no eye afford “A tear to grace his obsequies. “Is the sable Warriour fled? “Thy son is gone. He rests among the Dead. “The Swarm, that in thy noon-tide beam were born, “Gone to salute the rising Morn. “Fair laughs the Morn, and soft the Zephyr blows, “While proudly riding o'er the azure realm “In gallant trim the gilded Vessel goes; “Youth on the prow, and Pleasure at the helm; “Regardless of the sweeping Whirlwind's sway, “That, hush'd in grim repose, expects his evening-prey. 3 “ Richard the Second, (as we are told by Archbishop Scroop, Thomas of Walsingham, and all the older Writers,) was starved to death. The story of his assassination by Sir Piers of Exon, is of much later date.Fill high the sparkling bowl, “The rich repast prepare, “Reft of a crown, he yet may share the feast: “Close by the regal chair “Fell Thirst and Famine scowl “A baleful smile upon their baffled Guest. “Heard ye the din of battle bray, “Lance to lance, and horse to horse? “Long Years of havock urge their destined course, “And thro' the kindred squadrons mow their way. “Ye Towers of Julius, London's lasting shame, “With many a foul and midnight murther fed, “Revere his Consort's faith, his Father's fame, “And spare the meek Usurper's holy head. “Above, below, the rose of snow, “Twined with her blushing foe, we spread: “The bristled Boar in infant-gore “Wallows beneath the thorny shade. “Now Brothers, bending o'er th'accursed loom, “Stamp we our vengeance deep, and ratify his doom.
