The divisions have been captured, but the markers ignored. To the reverende Divines, unto whom these Posies shall happen to be presented, George Gascoigne Esquire (professing armes in the defence of Gods truth) wisheth quiet in conscience, and all consolation in Christ Jesus. COMMENDATORY VERSES T. B. In prayse of Gasco[ig]nes Posies. We prayse the plough, that makes the fruitelesse soyle To bring forth corne, (through helpe of heavenly might) And eke esteeme the simple wretches toyle, Whose painefull handes doe labour day and night. We prayse the ground, whereon the herbes do grow, Which heale or helpe, our greeves and mortall paine, Yea weedes have worth, wherein we vertue know, For natures Art, nothing hath made in vaine. We prayse those floures which please the secrete sense, And do content, the tast or smell of man, The Gardners paynes and worke we recompence, That skilfull is, or aught in cunning can. But much more prayse to Gascoignes penne is due, Whose learned hande doth here to thee present, A Posie full of Hearbes, and Flowers newe, To please all braynes, to wit or learning bent. Howe much the minde doth passe the sense or smell, So much these Floures all other do excell. E. C. In prayse of Gascoignes Posies. In gladsome Spring, when sweete and pleasant shoures Have well renued, what winters wrath hath torne, And that we see, the wholesome smelling Floures, Begin to laugh rough winters wracke to scorne: If then by chaunce, or choyce of owners will, We roame and walke in place of rare delightes, And therein finde, what Arte or natures skill Can well set forth, to feede our hungrie sightes: Yea more, if then the owner of the soyle, Doth licence yeelde to use all as our owne, And gladly thinkes, the fruites of all his toyle, To our behoofe to be well set and sowne. It cannot be, but this so great desart In basest breast doth breede this due regarde, With worlde of thankes, to prayse this friendly part, And wish that woorth mought pay a just rewarde. Good Reader then, beholde what gallant spring This booke brings forth, of fruites of finest sortes, Be bolde to take, thy list of everie thing, For so is ment. And for thy glad disportes The paine was tane: therefore lo this I crave, In his behalfe, that wrote this pleasant worke, With care and cost, (and then most freely gave His labours great, wherein great treasures lurke: To thine avayle) let his desartes now binde thee, In woorde and deede, he may still thankfull finde thee. M. C. commending the correction of Gascoignes Posies. The Beares blinde whelpes, which lacke both nayles and heare, And lie like lumpes, in filthie farrowed wise, Do (for a time) most ougly beastes appeare, Till dammes deare tongue, do cleare their clozed eyes. The gadde of steele, is likewise blunt and blacke, Till file and fire, do frame it sharpe and bright: Yea precious stones, their glorious grace do lacke, Till curious hand do make them please the sight. And so these floures, although the grounde were gay, Whereon they grew, and they of gallant hew, Yet till the badde were cullde and cast away, The best became the worse by such a crew. (For my part) then: I lyked not their smell, But as they be, I like them pretly well. R. S. In prayse of Gascoignes Posies. The pleasant plot wherein these Posies grew, May represent Parnassus springs indeede. Where Pallas with hir wise and learned crew, Did plant great store, and sow much cunning seede. That Goddesse then, on whom the Muses wayte, To garde hir grounde from greedie gathrers spoyle, Hath here ordeynde, by fine and close conceyte, A greene knight chiefe, and master of the soyle. Such badge beares he that beautified this booke With glorious shew, of sundrie gallant flowers. But since he first this labor undertooke, He gleand thereout, (to make the profite ours) A heape of Hearbes, a sort of fruitfull seedes, A needefull salve, compound of needlesse weedes. Appendix. All these (with more) my freend here freely gives: Nor naked wordes, nor streyne of straunge devise. But Gowers minde, which now in Gascoigne lives, Yeeldes heere in view, (by judgement of the wise) His penne, his sworde, himselfe, and all his might, To Pallas schoole, and Mars in Princes right. T. Ch. In prayse of Gascoignes Posies. Though goodnesse of the gold, needes no mans praise ye know, (And every coyne is judgde and found, by weight, by stamp, or show) Yet doth the prayse of men, give gold a double grace, And makes both pearls and Jewels rich desirde in every place. The horse full finely formde, whose pace and traine is true, Is more esteemde for good report, than likte for shape and view. Yea sure, ech man himselfe, for all his wit and skill, (If world bestow no lawde on him) may sleepe in silence still. Fame shewes the value first, of everie precious thing, And winnes with lyking all the brute, that doth the credit bring. And fame makes way before, to workes that are unknowne, And peoples love is caried ther, where fame hir trump hath blown. A cunning workman fine, in Cloyster close may sit, And carve or paint a thousand things, and use both art and wit, Yet wanting worldes renowne, may scape unsought or seene: It is but fame that outruns all, and gets the goall I weene. The learned Doctors lawd, that heales where other harmes, By c?mon prayse of peoples voyce, brings pacients in by swarmes. A goodly stately house, hath seldome any fame, Till world behold the buildings through, and people see the same. The Flowers and Posies sweete, in better price are held, When those have praysde their vertues rare, that have their odor smeld. So by these foresayd proofes, I have a pardon free, To speake, to write, and make discourse, of any worke I see, That worthie is of prayse: for prayse is all we get. Present the worlde with labors great, the world is in your det, It never yeeldes rewarde, nor scarce just prayse will give: Then studie out to stand on fame, and strive by fame to live. Our olde forefathers wise, saw long before these dayes, How sone faint world would fail deserts, and cold would wax our prayse. And knowing that disdeyne, for toyle did rather rise, Than right renowne (whose gold? buds, growes up to starry skies) Betooke their labors long, and every act they did, Unto the Gods, from whose deepe sight, no secret can be hid. And these good gracious Gods, sent downe from heavens hie, (For noble minds) an endlesse fame, that throw the world doth flie. Which fame is due to those, that seeke by new device, To honor learning every way, and Vertue bring in price. From Knowledge gardeyn gay, where science sowes hir seedes, A pretie Posie gathered is, of Flowers, Hearbes, and Weedes. The Flowers by smel are found, the hearbs their goodnes showes, The Weedes amid both hearbs &amp; flowers, in dec?t order growes. The soft and tender nose, that can no weedes abide, May make his choise of holesome hearbes, whose vertues well are tride. The fine and flowing wittes, that feede on straunge delites, May tast (for seasning daintie mouthes) the bitter weede that bites: The well disposed minde, and honest meaning man, Shall finde (in floures) proude Peacoks plumes, and feathers of the Swan. The curst and crabbed Carle, that Posies flings away, By this (perhaps) may find some cause, with prettie floures to play. The kinde and loving worme, that woulde his ladie please, M[a]y light on some such medcin here, shal do them both much ease. The Lad that lykes the schoole, and will good warning take: May snatch some rules oute of this booke, that may him doctor make. The hastie travayling head, that flies to foreyne place, May wey by this what home is woorth, and stay his roving race. The manly courage stoute, that seeketh fame full farre, Shall find by this how sweete is peace, and see how soure is warre. This Posie is so pickt, and choysely sorted throw, There is no Flower, Herbe, nor Weede, but serves some purpose now. Then since it freely comes, to you for little cost, Take well in worth these paynes of him, that thinkes no labor lost: To do his countrie good, as many others have, Who for their toyles a good report, of worlde did onely crave. Grudge not to yeeld some fame, for fruites that you receyve, Make some exchaunge for franke good will, some signe or token leave, To shew your thankfull harts. For if you love to take, And have a conscience growne so great, you can no gift forsake, And cannot give againe, that men deserve to reape, Adieu we leave you in the hedge, and ore the stile we leape. And yet some stile or verse, we after shape in ryme, That may by arte shewe you a Glasse, to see your selves in tyme. Thus wish I men their right: and you that judge amisse, To mend your minds, or frame your Muse, to make the like of this. G. W. In prayse of Gascoigne, and his Posies. Reader rewarde nought else, but onely good report, For all these pleasant Posies here, bound up in sundrie sort. The flowers fayre and fresh, were set with painefull toyle, Of late in Gascoignes Garden plot, a passing pleasant soyle. Now weedes of little worth, are culde from out the rest, Which he with double paine, did work, to gleane the bad fr? best. The state is very straunge, and fortune rare in use, Whose heavie happe he neither helpes, nor blazeth their abuse. In thundring verse he wrayes, where highest mindes be thrall, Where mischeefe seekes to rayse it selfe, by force of others fall. He pluckes the visour of, from maskes of peevish pride, And wrayes what sowre (in sweet pret?ce) the coustly corts c? hide. In everie gallant flower, he setteth forth to show, Of Venus thralles, the hap, the harme, the want, the weale, the woe. He finely findes their faultes, whose welth doth foster wrong, Who toucheth sinne (without offence) must plainly sing his song. His loftie vaine in verse, his stately stile in prose, Foretelles that Pallas ment by him, for to defende hir foes. Wherwith to Mars his might, his lustie limmes are knit, (A sight most rare) that Hectors mind, should match with Pallas wit. By proofe of late appeared (how so reportes here ran) That he in field was formost still, in spoyle the hynmost man. No backward blastes could bruse the valour of his thought, Although slie hap, forestoode his hope, in that he credite sought. In fortunes spight he strave, by vertues to aspire, Resolvde when due deserts might mount, then he should have his hire. Thus late with Mars in field, a lustie Souldiour shewde, And now with peace in Pallas schoole, he freendly hath bestowde, On thee this heape of flowers, the fruites of all his toyle, Whereof if some but simple seeme, consider well the soyle. They grew not all at home, some came from forreyne fieldes, The which (percase) set here againe, no pleasant savour yeeldes. Yet who mislyketh most, the worst will hardly mend, And he were best not write at all, which no man will offend. P. B. to such as have heretofore found fault with Gascoignes Posies. Gaynst good deserts, both pride and envie swell, As neede repines, to see his neighbour ritche: And slaunder chafes, where vertues prosper well, As sicke men thinke, all others health to mitch: Such filthie faultes, mens harts ofttymes inflame, That spight presumes, to stayne the worthies name. Are brutall things, transferred so to men? Or men become more savage than the beast? We see the dogge, that kenelles in his den, (For onely foode) obeyes his Lordes behest: Yea more than that, remembers so reliefe, As (in his kinde) he mournes at masters griefe. If thou perceyve, whereto my tale intendes, Then (slaunder) cease to wrong a frendly wight, Who for his countreys good, his travayle spendes, Sometime where blowes are given in bloudie fight: And other tymes he frames with skilfull pen, Such verse, as may content eche moulde of men. As nowe beholde, he here presentes to thee, The blossoms fayre, of three well sorted seedes. The first he feynes, fresh Flowers for to bee: The second Herbes, the last he termeth Weedes. All these, the soyle of his well fallowed brayne, (With Pallas droppes bedewde) yeeldes for thy gaine. The Hearbes to grave conceyt, and skilfull age, The fragrant Flowers to sent of yonger smell: The worthlesse Weedes, to rule the wanton rage Of recklesse heades, he gives: then use them well: And gather (friend) but neyther spight nor spoyle, These Posies made, by his long painfull toyle. A. W. In commendation of Gascoigne and his Posies. I praysed once a booke (whereby I purchast blame) And venturde for to write a verse, before I knewe the same. So that I was deceyvde, for when it came to light, The booke deserved no such worde, as I therein did wright. Thus lept I ere I lookt, and wandred ere I wist, Which gives (me haggard) warning since, to trust no falkners fist. And yet the booke was good, (by hap and not my skill) But not a Booke of such contentes, as might my wordes fulfill. Well now I neede not feare, these Posies here to prayse, Bicause I knew them every flower, and where they grew alwayes. And sure for my conceyt, even when they bloomed first, Me thought they smelt not much amisse, no not the very worst. Perhappes some daintie nose, no Batchlers button lykes, And some at Pimpernell and Pinkes, a slender quarell pykes. Some thinke that Gillyflowers, do yeeld a gelous smell, And some (which like none herbe but Sage) say Finkell tastes not well. Yet Finkell is of force, and Gillyflowers are good, And Pinks please some, and Pimpernell doth serve to steynch the blood: And Batchlers buttons be, the bravest to beholde, But sure that flower were best not grow, which can abide no colde. For slaunder blowes so shrill, with easterne envious windes, And frosts of frumps so nip the rootes, of vertuous meaning minds That few good flowers can thrive, unlesse they be protected, Or garded from suspitious blastes, or with some proppes erected. So seemeth by the wight, which gardened this grounde, And set such flowers on every bed, that Posies here abounde. Yet some tongues cannot well, affoorde him worthie prayse, And by our Lorde they do him wrong, for I have sene his wayes, And marked all his moodes, and have had proofe likewise, That he can do as well in field, as pen can here devise. Not many Monthes yet past, I saw his doughtie deedes, And since (to heare what slaunder sayes) my heavie hart it bleedes. Yet Reader graunt but this, to trie before thou trust, So shalt thou find his flowers and him, both gallant, good and just. I. B. In commendation of Gascoignes Posies. The saverie sappes in Gascoignes Flowers that are, Which strayned were by loftie learnings lore: Could not content the surly for their share, Ne cause them once, to yeeld him thankes therefore: Such was his hap, when first in hande he tooke, By labor long, to bring to light this Booke. Yet hath he not (for all this) seemde to cease, Those Flowers fresh againe in ground to set, And yeeld them earth to bring forth their increase, With other slippes from forraine soyle yfet. Which he hath gaynde by hazarde of his life, In bloudie broyles, where pouldred shot was rife. This endlesse toyle, contented well his minde, Hope helde the helme, his Fame on shore to set: His deepe desire, was friendship for to finde, At readers handes, he nought else sought to get: Wherefore (doubtlesse) they did him double wrong, Which F. and J. mysconstrued have so long. Yet least I should passe from the golden ground, Of Gascoignes plat, wherein those Posies grew, I list to tell what Flowers there I found, And paint by penne, the honour to him dew: Since that his toyle doth well deserve the same, And sacred skill hath so advaunst his name. First did I finde the Flower of Fetters frute, Whereof my selfe have tasted to my paine: Then might I see the Greene knight touch the Lute, Whose cordes were coucht on frettes of deepe disdaine: And likewise there, I might perceyve full well, That fragrant Flower which Fansie bad farewell. In fine I found the flowre that Bellum hight, Sweete unto those, of sillie simple sense, Yet sharpe and sowre, to those that do delight In martiall martes, for gaine of pevish pense. Such buddes full brave, good Gascoignes Garden gave To all estates, which list the same to have. Wherefore (good friend) flie envies yrkesome yre, And tred the trace, which Reasons rule hath wrought, Yeeld not disdeyne to Gascoigne for his hyre, Whose brused braine for thee these flowers hath sought. Least if thou do, the blame on thee do light, Such friendly paynes to recompence with spight. I. D. In prayse of Gascoigne and his Posies. If Virgill how to till the Earth, to every man doth tell, And Galen he in Phisicks arte doth many men excell, If Poets olde deserven prayse, by paynting out aright, The frutes of vice, as Ovid doth, and many mo that wright, By learned skill of many things: If such exalt their name, And for their hyre, deserved prayse by trumpe of Ladie Fame: Why should the Authour of this booke then leese his due desart, Sith he so freendly here to us, hath shewed his skilfull arte? The healthsome herbs and flowers sweet, fr? weedes he hath divided, The fruits of Gives in prison str?g he hath right wel decided. Of warres also, and warriours to, even like a Martiall knight, He hath discourst, and shewed the lottes, that thereupon do light: Virgill is dead, and Galen gone, with Poets many more: Yet workes of theirs be still alive, and with us kept in store. This Authour lives, and Gascoigne hights, yet once to die most sure, Alas the while that worthie wightes may not alwayes endure, But workes of his among the best, for ever more shall rest, When he in heaven shall take a place prepared for the blest. The Printer in commendation of Gascoigne and his workes. Chawcer by writing purchast fame, And Gower got a worthie name: Sweete Surrey, suckt Pernassus springs, And Wiat wrote of wondrous things: Olde Rochfort clambe the stately Throne, Which Muses holde, in Hellicone. Then thither let, good Gascoigne go, For sure his verse, deserveth so. The opinion of the aucthor himself after all these commendations. What neede I speake my self, since other say so much? Who seme to praise these poesies so, as if ther wer none such? But sure my silly self, do find therein no smell, Which may deserve such passing prayse, or seeme to taste so well. This boone I onely crave, that Readers yet will deigne (If any weede herein do seeme, his fellow flowres to stayne) Then reade but others workes, and marke if that they finde, No toyes therein which may dislike, some modest readers minde? Reade Virgills Pryapus, or Ovids wanton verse, Which he about Corinnaes couche, so clerkly can rehearse. Reade Faustoes filthy tale, in Ariostoes ryme, And let not Marots Alyx passe, without impeach of crime. These things considred well, I trust they will excuse This muze of mine, although she seem, such toyes somtimes to use. Beleeve me Lordings all, it is a Poetes parte, To handle eche thing in his kinde, for therein lieth his arte: Lucillius ledde the daunce, and Horace made the lawe, That poetes by Aucthoritie, may call (A dawe) A Dawe, And eke (a hore) A Hore, but yet in cleanly wordes, So that the vice may be rebukt, as though it were in bourdes: This phrase sometimes I use, which (if it be a faute) Condempne not all the rest therfore, that here in verse is taught, Smell every poesie right, and you therein shall finde, Fresh flowres, good hearbes, &amp; holsome weedes, to please a skilfull minde. Tam Marti, quàm Mercurio. FINIS. His ultimum vale to Amorous verse. Kinde Erato, and wanton Thalia, (Whose name my muze, devoutly did invoke) Adieu deare dames, Caliope sings alia, Which are more worth, and smell not of the smoke. And if blinde Cupide, chaunce to stryke a stroke, I vowe my verse, Apocrypha shalbe, In silence shutte, that none (but you) may see. FINIS. Tam Marti, quàm Mercurio. FLOWERS. The Anatomye of a Lover. To make a Lover knowne, by plaine Anatomie, You lovers all that list beware, loe here behold you me. Who though mine onely lookes, your pittie wel might move, Yet every part shall playe his part, to paint the panges of love. If first my feeble head, have so much matter left, If fansies raging force have not, his feeble skill bereft. These lockes that hang unkempt, these hollowe dazled eyes, These chattering teeth, this tr?bling tongue, well tewed with carefull cries. These wan and wrinkled cheekes, wel washt with waves of woe, Maye stand for patterne of a ghost, where so this carkasse goe. These shoulders they sustaine, the yoake of heavy care, And on my brused broken backe, the burden must I beare. These armes quite braunfalne are, with beating on my brest, This right hand weary is to write, this left hand craveth rest: These sides enclose the forge, where sorrowe playes the smith, And hote desire, hath kindled fire, to worke this mettall with. The Anvile is my heart, my thoughtes they strike the stroake, My lights and lunges like bellowes blow, &amp; sighes ascend for smoake. My secreete partes are so with secreete sorrowe soken, As for the secreete shame thereof, deserves not to be spoken, My thighes, my knees, my legges, and last of all my feete, To serve a lovers turne, are so unable and unmeete, That scarce they sustaine up, this restlesse body well, Unlesse it be to see the boure, wherein my love doth dwell, And there by sight eftsoone, to feede my gazing eye, And so content my hungrie corps, tyll dollours doe me dye: Yet for a just reward of love so dearely bought, I pray you saye, loe this was he, whome love had worne to nought. Ever or never. The arraig[n]ment of a Lover. At Beautyes barre as I dyd stande, When false suspect accused mee, George (quod the Judge) holde up thy hande, Thou art arraignde of Flatterye: Tell therefore howe thou wylt bee tryde? Whose judgement here wylt thou abyde? My Lorde (quod I) this Lady here, Whome I esteeme above the rest, Doth knowe my guilte if any were: Wherefore hir doome shall please me best, Let hir bee Judge and Jurour boathe, To trye mee guiltlesse by myne oathe. Wyll is dame bewties chiefe Justice of Oyre and terminer.Quod Beautie, no, it fitteth not, A Prince hir selfe to judge the cause: Wyll is our Justice well you wot, Appointed to discusse our Lawes: If you wyll guiltlesse seeme to goe, God and your countrey quitte you so. Then crafte the cryer cal'd a quest, Of whome was falshoode formost feere, A packe of pickethankes were the rest, Which came false witnesse for to beare, The Jurye suche, the Judge unjust, Sentence was sayde I should be trust. Jelous the Jayler bound mee fast, To heare the verdite of the byll, George (quod the Judge) nowe thou art cast, Thou must goe hence to heavie hill, And there be hangde all but the head, God rest thy soule when thou art dead. Downe fell I then upon my knee, All flatte before Dame Beauties face, And cryed, good Ladye pardon mee, Which here appeale unto your grace, You knowe if I have beene untrue, It was in too much praysing you. And though this Judge doe make suche haste, To shead with shame my guiltlesse blood: Yet let your pittie first bee plaste, To save the man that meant you good, So shall you shewe your selfe a Queene, And I maye bee your servaunt seene. (Quod Beautie) well: bicause I guesse, What thou dost meane hencefoorth to bee, Although thy faultes deserve no lesse, Than Justice here hath judged thee, Wylt thou be bounde to stynt all strife, And be true prisoner all thy lyfe? Yea Madame (quod I) that I shall, Common Bayll. Loe fayth and trueth my suerties: Why then (quod shee) come when I call, I aske no better warrantise. Thus am I Beauties bounden thrall, At hir commaunde when shee doth call. Ever or never. The passion of a Lover. I smyle sometimes although my griefe be great, To heare and see these lovers paint their paine, And how they can in pleasaunt rimes repeate, The passing pangs, which they in fancies faine. But if I had such skyll to frame a verse, I could more paine than all their panges rehearse. Some saye they finde nor peace, nor power to fight, Which seemeth strange: but stranger is my state: I dwell in dole, yet sojorne with delight, Reposde in rest, yet weryed with debate. For flatte repulse, might well appease my wyll, But fancie fightes, to trye my fortune styll. Some other saye they hope, yet live in dread, They friese, they flame, they flie aloft, they fall, But I nor hope with happe to rayse my head, Nor feare to stoupe, for why my gate is small. Nor can I friese, with cold to kyll my heart, Nor yet so flame, as might consume my smart. How live I then, which thus drawe foorth my dayes? Or tell me howe, I found this fever first? What fits I feele? what distance? what delayes? What griefe? what ease? what lyke I best? what worst? These thinges they tell, which seeke redresse of paine, And so wyll I, although I coumpt it vaine. I live in love, even so I love to live, (Oh happie state, twise happie he that findes it) But love to life this cognisance doth geve, This badge this marke, to every man that mindes it, Love lendeth life, which (dying) cannot dye, Nor lyving live: and such a life leade I. The Sunny dayes which gladde the saddest wightes, Yet never shine to cleare my misty moone: No quiet sleepe, amidde the mooneshine nightes, Can close mine eyes, when I am woe begone. Into such shades my peevishe sorrowe shrowdes, That Sunne and Moone, are styll to me in clowdes. And feverlike I feede my fancie styll, With such repast, as most empaires my health, Which fever first I caught by wanton wyll, When coles of kind dyd stirre my blood by stealth: And gazing eyes, in bewtie put such trust, That love enflamd my liver al with lust. My fits are lyke the fever Ectick fits, There is in deede suche a kinde of fever. Which one daye quakes within and burnes without, The next day heate within the boosoms sits, And shiviring colde the body goes about. So is my heart most hote when hope is colde, And quaketh most when I most heate behold. Tormented thus without delayes I stand, All wayes in one and evermore shalbe, In greatest griefe when helpe is nearest hand, And best at ease if death might make me free: Delighting most in that which hurtes my heart, And hating change which might relieve my smart. Yet you deare dame: to whome this cure pertaines, Lenvoye. Devise by times some drammes for my disease, A noble name shall be your greatest gaines, Whereof be sure, if you wyll worke mine ease. And though fond fooles set forth their fittes as fast, Yet graunt with me that my straunge passion past. Ever or never. A straunge passion of a Lover. Amid my Bale I bath in blisse, I swim in heaven, I sinke in hell: I find amends for every misse, And yet my moane no tongue can tell. I live and love, what wold you more: As never lover liv'd before. I laugh sometimes with little lust, So jest I oft and feele no joye: Myne ease is builded all on trust: And yit mistrust breedes myne anoye. I live and lacke, I lacke and have: I have and misse the thing I crave. These things seeme strange, yet are they trew, Beleeve me sweete my state is such, One pleasure which I wold eschew, Both slakes my grief and breedes my grutch. So doth one paine which I would shoon, Renew my joyes where grief begoon. Then like the larke that past the night. In heavy sleepe with cares opprest: Yit when shee spies the pleasaunt light, She sends sweete notes from out hir brest. So sing I now because I thinke How joyes approch, when sorrowes shrinke. And as fayre Philomene againe, Can watch and singe when other sleepe: And taketh pleasure in hir payne, To wray the woo that makes hir weepe. So sing I now for to bewray The lothsome life I lead alway. The which to thee (deare wenche) I write, That know'st my mirth, but not my moane: I praye God graunt thee deepe delight, To live in joyes when I am gone. I cannot live, it wyll not bee: I dye to thinke to part from thee. Ferendo Natura. The Divorce of a Lover. Divorce me nowe good death, from love and lingring life, That one hath pene my concubine, that other was my wife. In youth I lived with love, she had my lustye dayes, In age I thought with lingering life to stay my w?dering wais, But now abusde by both, I come for to complaine, To thee good death, in whom my helpe doth wholy now remain, My libell loe behold: wherein I doe protest, The processe of my plaint is true, in which my griefe doth rest. First love my concubine (whome I have kept so trimme, Even she for whome I seemd of yore, in seas of joy to swimme: To whome I dare avowe, that I have served as well, And played my part as gallantly, as he that beares the bell) She cast me of long since, and holdes me in disdaine, I cannot pranke to please hir nowe, my vaunting is but vaine. My writhled cheekes bewraye, that pride of heate is past, My stagring steppes eke tell the trueth, that nature fadeth fast, My quaking crooked joyntes, are combred with the crampe, The boxe of oyle is wasted wel, which once dyd feede my lampe. The greenesse of my yeares, doth wyther now so sore, Such a sect there is that desire no longer lyfe th? whiles they are in love. That lusty love leapes quite awaye, and lyketh me no more, And love my lemman gone, what lyking can I take? In lothsome lyfe that croked croane, although she be my make? Shee cloyes me with the cough, hir comfort is but cold, She bids me give mine age for almes, wher first my youth was sold. No day can passe my head, but she beginnes to brall, No mery thoughts conceived so fast, but she confounds them al. When I pretend to please, she overthwarts me still, When I wou[l]d faynest part with hir, she overwayes my will. Be judge then gentle death, and take my cause in hand, Consider every circumstaunce, marke how the case doth stand. Percase thou wilte aledge, that cause thou canst none see, But that I like not of that one, that other likes not me: Yes gentle judge give eare, and thou shalt see me prove, My concubine incontinent, a common whore is love. And in my wyfe I find, such discord and debate, As no man living can endure the tormentes of my state. Wherefore thy sentence say, devorce me from them both, Since only thou mayst right my wronges, good death nowe be not loath. But cast thy pearcing dart, into my panting brest, That I may leave both love and life, &amp; thereby purchase rest. Haud ictus sapio. The Lullabie of a Lover. Sing lullaby, as women doe, Wherewith they bring their babes to rest, And lullaby can I sing to, As womanly as can the best. With lullaby they still the childe, And if I be not much beguild, Full many wanton babes have I, Which must be stild with lullabie. First lullaby my youthfull yeares, It is nowe time to go to bed, For croocked age and hoary heares, Have wone the haven [within] my head: With Lullaby then youth be still, With Lullaby content thy will, Since courage quayles, and commes behind, Go sleepe, and so beguile thy minde. Next Lullaby my gazing eyes, Which wonted were to glaunce apace. For every Glasse maye nowe suffise, To shewe the furrowes in my face: With Lullabye then winke awhile, With Lullabye your lookes beguile: Lette no fayre face, nor beautie brighte, Entice you efte with vayne delighte. And Lullaby my wanton will, Lette reasons rule, nowe reigne thy thought, Since all to late I finde by skyll, Howe deare I have thy fansies bought: With Lullaby nowe tak thyne ease, With Lullaby thy doubtes appease: For trust to this, if thou be styll, My body shall obey thy will. Eke Lullaby my loving boye, My little Robyn take thy rest, Since age is colde, and nothing coye, Keepe close thy coyne, for so is best: With Lulla[b]y be thou content, With Lullaby thy lustes relente, Lette others pay which hath mo pence, Thou art to pore for such expence. Thus Lullabye my youth, myne eyes, My will, my ware, and all that was, I can no mo delayes devise, But welcome payne, let pleasure passe: With Lullaby now take your leave, With Lullaby your dreames deceive, And when you rise with waking eye, Remember then this Lullabye. Ever or Never. The lamentation of a lover. Now have I found the waie, to weepe &amp; wayle my fill, Now can I ende my dolfull dayes, &amp; so content my will. The way to weepe inough, for such as list to wayle, Is this: to go abord y? ship, where pleasure beareth sayle. And there to marke the jestes, of every joyfull wight, And with what winde and wave they fleet, to nourish their delight. For as the striken Deare, that seeth his fellowes feede, Amid the lustie [heard] (unhurt), &amp; feeles himselfe to bleede Or as the seely byrd, that with the Bolte is brusd, And lieth aloofe among the leaves, of al hir pheares refusd, And heares them sing full shrill, yet cannot she rejoyce, Nor frame one warbling note to passe, out of hir mournfull voyce. Even so I finde by proofe, that pleasure dubleth payne, Unto a wretched wounded hart, which doth in woe, remaine. I passe where pleasure is, I heare some sing for joye, I see som laugh, som other da?ce, in spight of darke anoy. But out alas my mind, amends not by their myrth, I deeme al pleasurs to be paine, that dwell above y? earth. Such heavy humors feede, y? bloud that lendes me breath, As mery medcins cannot serve, to keepe my corps from death. Spræta tamen vivunt. [Thou with thy lookes on whom I loke full ofte] Certaine verses written to a Gentlewoman whome hee liked very wel, and yet had never any oportunity to discover his affection, being alwayes bridled by jelouse lookes which attended them both, and therefore gessing by hir lokes, that she partly also liked him: he wrote in a booke of hirs as foloweth, being termed with the rest that follow the lokes of a lover enamoured. Thou with thy lookes on whom I loke full ofte, And find there in great cause of deepe delight: Thy face is fayre, thy skin is smoth and softe, Thy lippes are sweet, thine eyes are cleere and bright, And every part seemes pleasant in my sight. Yet wote thou well, those lokes have wrought my wo, Bicause I love to looke upon them so. For first those lookes allurd mine eye to loke, And strayght mine eye stird up my hart to love: And cruell love with deepe deceitfull hooke, Chokt up my mind whom fancie cannot move, Nor hope releeve, nor other helpe behove: But still to loke, and though I loke to much, Needes must I loke bicause I see none such. Thus in thy lookes my love and life have hold, And with such life my death drawes on a pace: And for such death no medcine can be told, But loking still upon thy lovely face, Wherin are painted pitie, peace, and grace, Then though thy lokes should cause me for to dye, Needes must I looke, bicause I live therby. Since then thy lookes my lyfe have so in thrall, As I can like none other lookes but thine: Lo here I yeelde my lyfe, my love, and all Into thy hands, and all things else resigne, But libertie to gaze upon thyne eyen. Which when I doe, then think it were thy part, To looke again, and linke with me in hart. Si fortunatus [infœlix]. With these verses you shall judge the quicke capacitie of the Lady: for she wrote thereunder this short aunswere. Looke as long as you lyst, but surely if I take you looking, I will looke with you. [I cast mine eye and sawe ten eyes at once] And for a further proofe of this Dames quicke understanding, you shall now understande, that sone after this aunswere of hirs, the same Aucthour chansed to be at a supper in hir company, where were also hir brother, hir husband, and an old lover of hirs by whom shee had bene long suspected. Nowe, although there wanted no delicate viandes to content them, yet their chiefe repast was by entreglancing of lokes. For the Aucthour being stong with hotte affection, coulde none otherwyse relieve his passion but by gazing. And the Dame of a curteous enclination deigned (nowe and then) to requite the same with glancing at him. Hir olde lover occupied his eyes with watching: and her brother perceiving all this coulde not abstaine from winking, whereby hee might putte his Syster in remembraunce, least she shoulde too much forget hir selfe. But most of all her husbande beholding the first, and being evyll pleased with the seconde, scarce contented with the thirde, and misconstruing the fourth, was constrayned to playe the fifth part in frowarde frowning. This royall banquet thus passed over, the Aucthor knowing that after supper they should passe the tyme in propounding of Ryddles, and making of purposes: contrived all this conceipt in a Riddle as followeth. The which was no soner prono?ced, but shee coulde perfectly perceive his intent, and drave out one nayle with another, as also enseweth. His Ryddle. I cast mine eye and sawe ten eyes at once, All seemelye set uppon one lovely face: Twoo gaz'd, twoo glanc'd, twoo watched for the nonce, Twoo winked wiles, twoo fround with froward grace. Thus everye eye was pitched in his place. And everye eye which wrought eche others wo, Saide to it selfe, alas why lookt I so? And everye eye for jelousie did pine, And sigh'd and sayde, I would that eye were mine. Si fortunatus infœlix. [What thing is that which swimmes in blisse] In all this lovelie company was not one that coulde and would expound the meaning hereof. At last the Dame hir selfe aunswered on this wise. Syr, quod she, because your darke speach is much to curious for this simple company, I wyl bee so bolde as to quit one question with another. And when you have aunswered mine, it maye fall out per-adventure, that I shall somewhat the better judge of yours. Hir Question. What thing is that which swimmes in blisse, And yet consumes in burning griefe: Which being plaste where pleasure is, Can yet recover no reliefe. Which sees to sighe, and sighes to see, All this is one, what maye it bee? [I grooped in thy pocket pretty peate] He held him selfe herewith contented: and afterwardes when they were better acquainted, he chaunsed once (groping in hir pocket) to find a letter of hir olde lovers: and thynking it were better to wincke than utterlye to put out his eyes, seemed not to understande this first offence: but soone after finding a lemman (the which he thought he sawe hir olde lemman put there) he devised therof thus, and delivered it unto hir in writing. I grooped in thy pocket pretty peate, And found a Lemman which I looked not: So founde I once (which nowe I must repeate) Both leaves and letters which I lyked not. Such hap have I to finde and seeke it not, But since I see no faster meanes to bind them, I wyll (hencefoorth) take Lemmans as I finde them. [A lymone (but no Lemmane) Syr you found] The Dame within verie short space dyd aunswere it thus. A lymone (but no Lemmane) Syr you found, For Lemmans beare their name to broade before: The which since it hath given you such a wound, That you seeme now offended very sore: Content your selfe you shall find (there) no more. But take your Lemmans henceforth where you lust, For I wyll shewe my letters where I trust. The lookes of a lover forsaken: written by a gentlewoman who passed by him with hir armes set bragging by hir sides, and lefte it unfinished as followeth. Were my hart set on hoygh as thine is bent, Or in my brest so brave and stout a will: Then (long ere this) I coulde have bene content, With sharpe reveng thy carelesse corpes to kill. For why thou knowest (although thou know not all) What rule, what raygne, what power, what segnory, Thy melting minde did yeeld to me (as thrall) When first I pleasd thy wandring fantisie. What lingring lookes bewray'd thyne inward thought, What panges were publisht by perplexcitie, Such reakes the rage of love in thee had wrought And no gramercie for thy curtesie. I list not vaunt, but yet I dare avowe (Had bene my harmelesse hart as harde as thine) I coulde have bounde thee then for starting nowe, In bondes of bale, in pangs of deadly pyne. For why by profe the field is eath to win, Where as the chiefteynes yeeld them selves in chaynes: The port or passage plaine to enter in, Where porters list to leave the key for gaynes. But did I then devise with crueltie, (As tyrants do) to kill the yeelding pray? Or did I bragge and boast triumphauntly, As who should saye the field were mine that daye? Did I retire my selfe out of thy sight To beat afresh the bulwarkes of thy brest? Or did my mind in choyce of change delight, And render thee as reffuse with the rest? No Tygre no, the lyon is not lewd, He shewes no force on seely wounded sheepe, &amp;c. [Howe long she lookt that lookt at me of late] Whiles he sat at the dore of his lodging, devising these verses above rehersed, the same Gentlewoman passed by againe, and cast a longe looke towardes him, whereby he left his former invention and wrote thus. Howe long she lookt that lookt at me of late, As who would say, hir lookes were all for love: When God he knowes they came from deadly hate, To pinch me yit with pangs which I must prove. But since my lokes hir liking maye not move, Looke where she likes, for lo this looke was cast, Not for my love, but even to see my last. Si fortunatus infœlix. An other Sonet written by the same Gentlewoman, uppon the same occasion. I lookt of late and sawe thee loke askance, Upon my dore, to see if I satte there. As who should say: If he be there by chance, Yet maye he thinke I loke him every where, No cruell, no, thou knowest and I can tell, How for thy love I layd my lokes a side: Though thou (par case) hast lookt and liked wel, Some newe founde lookes amide this world so wide. But since thy lookes my love have so in chaynd That to my lokes, thy liking now is past: Loke where thou likest, and let thy hands be staynd, In true loves bloud, which thou shalt lack at last, So looke, so lack, for in these toyes thus tost, My lookes thy love, thy lookes my life have lost. Si fortunatus infœl[i]x. To the same gentlewoman because she challenged the Aucthour for holding downe his head alwaies, and for that hee looked not uppon hir in wonted manner. You must not wonder though you thinke it straunge, To see me holde my lowring head so lowe: And that myne eyes take no delyght to raunge, About the gleames which on your face doe growe. The mouse which once hath broken out of trappe, Is sildome tysed with the trustlesse bayte, But lyes aloofe for feare of more mishappe, And feedeth styll in doubte of deepe deceipte. The skorched flye which once hath scapt the flame, Wyll hardlye come to playe againe with fyre. Whereby I learne that greevous is the game, Which followes fansie dazled by desire. So that I wynke or else holde downe my head, Because your blazing eyes my bale have bred. Si fortunatus infœlix. The Recantacion of a Lover. Now must I needes recant the wordes which once I spoke, Fond fansie fumes so nie my noose, I nedes must smel y? smoke: And better were to beare a Faggot from the fire, Than wylfully to burne and blaze, in flames of vaine desire. You Judges then give eare, you people marke me well, I saye, both heaven and earth record the tale which I shall tell And knowe that dread of death, nor hope of better hap, Have forced or perswaded me to take my turning cap, But even that mightye Jove, of his great clemencie, Hath given me grace at last to judge, the trueth from heresie: I saye then and professe, with free and faithfull heart, That wom?s vowes are nothing els, but snares of secret smart: Their beauties blaze are baites which seeme of pleasant taste, But who devoures the hidden hooke, eates poyson for repast: Their smyling is deceipt, their faire wordes traines of treason, Their wit alwaies so full of wyles, it skorneth rules of reason. Percase some present here, have heard my selfe of yore, Both teach &amp; preach the contrary, my fault was then the more: I graunt my workes were these, first one Anatomie, Wherein I painted every pang of [loves] perplexitye: Next that I was araignde, with George holde up thy hand, Wherein I yeelded Bewties thrall, at hir commaund to stand: Myne eyes so blinded were, (good people marke my tale) That once I song, I Bathe in Blisse, amidde my weary Bale: And many a frantike verse, then from my penne dyd passe, In waves of wicked heresie, so deepe I drowned was. All which I now recant, and here before you burne Those trifling bookes, from whose lewde lore my tippet here I turne. And hencefoorth wyl I write, howe mad is that mans minde, Which is entist by any traine to trust in womankind. Astolf being the goodliest personne in the worlde founde a dwarfe lying with his wifeI spare not wedlocke I, who lyst that state advance, Aske Astolfe king of Lumbardie, howe trim his dwarfe coulde daunce. Wherefore fayre Ladies you, that heare me what I saye, If you hereafter see me slippe, or seeme to goe astraye: Or if my tongue revolte from that which nowe it sayth, Then plague me thus, Beleeve it not, for this is nowe my faith. Haud ictus sapio. In prayse of Bridges, nowe Lady Sandes. In Court who so demaundes what Dame doth most excell, For my conceyt I must needes say, faire Bridges beares y? bell: Upon whose lively cheeke, to proove my judgement true, The Rose and Lillie seeme to strive for equall change of hewe: And therewithall so well her graces all agree, No frowning cheere dare once presume in hir sweete face to bee. Although some lavishe lippes, which like some other best, Wyll saye the blemishe on hir browe disgraceth all the rest. Thereto I thus replie, God wotte they litle know, The hidden cause of that mishap, nor how the harme dyd grow. For when Dame nature first had framde hir heavenly face, And thoroughly bedecked it, with goodly gleames of grace: It lyked hir so well: Lo here (quod shee) a peece, For perfect shape that passeth all Apelles worke in Greece. This bayte may chaunce to catche the greatest God of love, Or mighty thundring Jove himself that rules the roast above. But out, alas, those wordes were vaunted all in vaine, And some unsene were present there (poore Bridges) to thy pain. For Cupide craftie boye, close in a corner stoode, Not blyndfold then, to gaze on hir, I gesse it dyd him good. Yet when he felt the flame gan kindle in his brest, And hard dame nature boast by hir, to breake him of his rest, His hote newe chosen love, he chaunged into hate, And sodainly with mighty mace, gan rap hir on the pate. It grieved Nature much to see the cruell deede: Me seemes I see hir how she wept, to see hir dearling blede. Well yet (quod she) this hurt shall have some helpe I trowe, And quicke with skin she covered it, that whiter is than snowe. Wherewith Dan Cupid fled, for feare of further flame, Wh? angel like he saw hir shine, whom he had smit with shame. Lo thus was Bridges hurt, in cradel of hir kind, The coward Cupid brake hir brow, to wreke his wo?ded mind, The skar styll there remaines, no force, there let it be, There is no clowde that can eclipse, so bright a sunne as she. Ever or never. In prayse of Zouche late the Lady Greye of Wilton whome the auctor found in a homely house. These rustie walles whome cankred yeares deface, The comely corps of seemely Zouche enclose, Whose auncient stocke derivde from worthy race, Procures hir praise, where so the carkas goes: Hir aungels face declares hyr modest minde, Hyr lovely lokes the gazing eyes allure, Hyr deedes deserve some endlesse prayse to finde, To blaze suche brute as ever might endure. Wherfore my penne in trembling feare shall staye, To write the thing that doth surmount my skill, And I will wish of God both night and daye, Some worthier place to guide hir worthy will. Where princes peeres hir due desertes maye see, And I content hir servaunt there to bee. Ever or Never. Gascoignes praise of his mistres. The hap which Paris had, as due for his desert, Who favord Venus for hir face, &amp; skornde Menervas art: May serve to warne the wise that they no more esteme, The glistering glosse of bewties blaze, than reason should it deme. Dan Priams yonger son, found out y? fairest dame, That ever trode on Troyane mold, what folowed of y? same? I list not brut hir bale, let others spread it forth, But for his parte to speake my minde his choice was little worth, My meaning is but this, who markes the outward shewe, And never grops for graftes of grace which in y? mind should grow: May chance upon such choise as trusty Troilus had, And dwel in dole as Paris did, when he would faine be glad. How happie then am I whose happe hath bene to finde, A mistresse first that doth excell in vertues of the mind. And yet therewith hath joynd, such favoure and suche grace, As Pandars niece (if she wer here) would quickly give hir place. With in whose worthy brest, Dame Bounty seekes to dwel, And saith to beawty, yeeld to me, since I doe thee excell. Betwene whose heavenly eyes, doth right remorse appeare, And pitie placed by the same, doth muche amende hir cheere. Who in my daungers deepe, dyd deigne to doe mee good, Who did relieve my heavy heart, and sought to save my blood. Who first encreast my friendes, and overthrew my fooes, Who loved al them that wisht me wel, &amp; liked none but those. O Ladies give me leave, I prayse not hir to farre, Since she doth pas you al, as much, as Titan staines a starre. You hold such servauntes deare, as able are to serve. She held me deare, when I poore soule, could no good thing deserve. You set by them that swim in all prosperitie, She set by me when as I was in great calamitie. You best esteeme the brave, and let the poorest passe, Shee best esteemde my poore good wyll, all naked as it was. But whether am I went? what humor guides my braine? I seeke to wey y? woolsack down, with one poore pepper grain. I seeme to penne hir praise, that doth surpasse my skill, I strive to rowe against the tide, I hoppe against the hill. Then let these fewe suffise, shee Helene staines for hewe, Dydo for grace, Cressyde for cheere, and is as Thisbye true. Yet if you furder crave, to have hir name displaide, Dame Favor is my mistres name, dame Fortune is hir maid. Attamen ad solitum. Gascoignes good morrow. You that have spent the silent night, In sleepe and quiet rest, And joye to see the cheerefull lyght That ryseth in the East: Now cleare your voyce, now chere your hart, Come helpe me nowe to sing: Eche willing wight come beare a part, To prayse the heavenly King. And you whome care in prison keepes, Or sickenes doth suppresse, Or secret sorowe breakes your sleepes, Or dolours doe distresse: Yet beare a parte in dolfull wise, Yea thinke it good accorde, And [ac]ceptable sacrifice, Eche sprite to prayse the lorde. The dreadfull night with darkesomnesse, Had over spread the light, And sluggish sleepe with drowsynesse, Had over prest our might: A glasse wherin you may beholde, Eche storme that stopes our breath, Our bed the grave, our clothes lyke molde, And sleepe like dreadfull death. Yet as this deadly night did laste, But for a little space, And heavenly daye nowe night is past, Doth shewe his pleasaunt face: So must we hope to see Gods face, At last in heaven on hie, When we have chang'd this mortall place, For Immortalitie. And of such happes and heavenly joyes, As then we hope to holde, All earthly sightes and wor[l]dly toyes, Are tokens to beholde. The daye is like the daye of doome, The sunne, the Sonne of man, The skyes the heavens, the earth the tombe Wherein we rest till than. The Rainbowe bending in the skye, Bedeckte with sundrye hewes, Is like the seate of God on hye, And seemes to tell these newes: That as thereby he promised, To drowne the world no more, So by the bloud which Christ hath shead, He will our helth restore. The mistie cloudes that fall somtime, And overcast the skyes, Are like to troubles of our time, Which do but dymme our eyes: But as suche dewes are dryed up quite, When Phœbus shewes his face, So are such fansies put to flighte, Where God doth guide by grace. The caryon Crowe, that lothsome beast, Which cryes agaynst the rayne, Both for hir hewe and for the rest, The Devill resembleth playne: And as with gonnes we kill the Crowe, For spoyling our releefe, The Devill so must we overthrowe, With gonshote of beleefe. The little byrde[s] which sing so swete, Are like the angelles voyce, Which render God his prayses meete, And teache us to rejoyce: And as they more esteeme that myrth, Than dread the nights anoy, So mu[ste] we deeme our days on earth, But hell to heavenly joye. Unto which Joyes for to attayne God graunt us all his grace, And sende us after worldly payne, In heaven to have a place. Where wee maye still enjoy that light, Which never shall decaye: Lorde for thy mercy lend us might, To see that joyfull daye. Haud ictus sapio. Gascoygnes good night. When thou hast spent the lingring day in pleasure and delight, Or after toyle and wearie waye, dost seeke to rest at nighte: Unto thy paynes or pleasures past, adde this one labour yet, Ere sleepe close up thyne eye to fast, do not thy God forget, But searche within thy secret thoughts, what deeds did thee befal: And if thou find amisse in ought, to God for mercy call. Yea though thou find nothing amisse, which thou canst cal to mind, Yet ever more remember this, there is the more behind: And thinke how well so ever it be, that thou hast spent the daye, It came of God, and not of thee, so to direct thy waye. Thus if thou trie thy dayly deedes, and pleasure in this payne, Thy life shall clense thy corne from weeds, &amp; thine shal be y? gaine: But if thy sinfull sluggishe eye, will venter for to winke, Before thy wading will may trye, how far thy soule maye sinke, Beware and wake, for else thy bed, which soft &amp; smoth is made, May heape more harm up? thy head, than blowes of enmies blade. Thus if this paine procure thine ease, in bed as thou doest lye, Perhaps it shall not God displease, to sing thus soberly: I see that sleepe is lent me here, to ease my wearye bones, As death at laste shall eke appeere, to ease my greevous grones. My dayly sportes, my panch full fed, have causde my drousie eye, As carelesse life in quiet led, might cause my soule to dye: The stretching armes, y? yauning breath, which I to bedward use, Are patternes of the pangs of death, when life will me refuse: And of my bed eche sundrye part in shaddowes doth resemble, The s?dry shapes of deth, whose dart shal make my flesh to tr?ble. My bed it selfe is like the grave, my sheetes the winding sheete, My clothes the mould which I must have, to cover me most meete: The hungry fleas which friske so freshe, to wormes I can c?pare, Which greedily shall gnaw my fleshe, &amp; leave the bones ful bare: The waking Cock that early crowes to weare the night awaye, Puts in my minde the trumpe that blowes before the latter day. And as I ryse up lustily, when sluggish sleepe is past, So hope I to rise joyfully, to Judgement at the last. Thus wyll I wake, thus wyll I sleepe, thus wyl I hope to ryse, Thus wyll I neither waile nor weepe, but sing in godly wyse. My bones shall in this bed remaine, my soule in God shall trust, By whome I hope to ryse againe from death and earthly dust. Haud ictus sapio. The introduction to the Psalme of De profundis. The Skies gan scowle, orecast with misty clowdes, When (as I rode alone by London waye, Cloakelesse, unclad) thus did I sing and say: Behold quoth I, bright Titan how he shroudes His head abacke, and yelds the raine his reach, Till in his wrath, Dan Jove have soust the soile, And washt me wretch which in his travaile toile. But holla (here) doth rudenesse me appeach, Since Jove is Lord and king of mighty power, Which can commaund the Sunne to shewe his face, And (when him lyst) to give the raine his place. Why doe not I my wery muses frame, (Although I bee well soused in this showre,) To write some verse in honour of his name? Gascoignes De profundis. From depth of doole wherein my soule doth dwell, From heavy heart which harbours in my brest, From troubled sprite which sildome taketh rest. From hope of heaven, from dreade of darkesome hell. O gracious God, to thee I crye and yell. My God, my Lorde, my lovely Lord aloane, To thee I call, to thee I make my moane. And thou (good God) vouchsafe in gree to take, This woefull plaint, Wherein I faint. Oh heare me then for thy great mercies sake. Oh bende thine eares attentively to heare, Oh turne thine eyes, behold me how I wayle, O hearken Lord, give eare for mine availe, O marke in minde the burdens that I beare: See howe I sinke in sorrowes everye where. Beholde and see what dollors I endure, Give eare and marke what plaintes I put in ure. Bende wylling eare: and pittie therewithall, My wayling voyce, Which hath no choyce. But evermore upon thy name to call. If thou good Lorde shouldest take thy rod in hande, If thou regard what sinnes are daylye done, If thou take holde where wee our workes begone, If thou decree in Judgement for to stande, And be extreame to see our scuses skande, If thou take note of every thing amysse, And wryte in rowles howe frayle our nature is, O gloryous God, O King, O Prince of power, What mortall wight, Maye then have lyght, To feele thy frowne, if thou have lyst to lowre? But thou art good, and hast of mercye store, Thou not delygh[t]st to see a sinner fall, Thou hearknest first, before we come to call. Thine eares are set wyde open evermore, Before we knocke thou commest to the doore. Thou art more prest to heare a sinner crye, Then he is quicke to climbe to thee on hye. Thy mighty name bee praysed then alwaye, Let fayth and feare, True witnesse beare. Howe fast they stand which on thy mercy staye. I looke for thee (my lovelye Lord) therefore. For thee I wayte for thee I tarrye styll, Myne eyes doe long to gaze on thee my fyll. For thee I watche, for thee I prye and pore. My Soule for thee attendeth evermore. My Soule doth thyrst to take of thee a taste, My Soule desires with thee for to bee plaste. And to thy worde (which can no man deceyve) Myne onely trust, My love and lust In co[n]fidence contin[u]allye shall cleave. Before the breake or dawning of the daye, Before the lyght be seene in loftye Skyes, Before the Sunne appeare in pleasaunt wyse, Before the watche (before the watche I saye) Before the warde that waytes therefore alwaye: My soule, my sense, my secreete thought, my sprite, My wyll, my wishe, my joye, and my delight: Unto the Lord that sittes in heaven on highe, With hastye wing, From me doeth fling, And stryveth styll, unto the Lorde to flye. O Israell, O housholde of the Lorde, O Abrahams Brattes, O broode of blessed seede, O chosen sheepe that love the Lord in deede: O hungrye heartes, feede styll upon his worde, And put your trust in him with one accorde. For he hath mercye evermore at hande, His fountaines flowe, his springes doe never stande. And plenteouslye hee loveth to redeeme, Such sinners all, As on him call, And faithfully his mercies most esteeme. Hee wyll redeeme our deadly drowping state, He wyll bring home the sheepe that goe astraye, He wyll helpe them that hope in him alwaye: He wyll appease our discorde and debate, He wyll soone save, though we repent us late. He wyll be ours if we continewe his, He wyll bring bale to joye and perfect blisse. He wyll redeeme the flocke of his electe, From all that is, Or was amisse. Since Abrahams heyres dyd first his Lawes reject. Ever or never. Gascoignes Memories, written upon this occasion. Hee had (in myddest of his youth) determined to abandone all vaine delightes and to returne unto Greyes Inne, there to undertake againe the studdie of the common Lawes. And being required by five sundry Gentlemen to write in verse somewhat worthye to bee remembred, before he entered into their fellowshippe, hee compiled these five sundrie sortes of metre uppon five sundrye theames, whiche they delivered unto him, and the first was at request of Frauncis Kinwelmarshe who delivered him this theame. Audaces fortuna juvat. And thereuppon hee wrote this Sonnette following. If yelding feare, or cancred villanie, In Cæsars haughtie heart had tane the charge, The walles of Rome had not bene rearde so hye, Nor yet the mightye Empire left so large. If Menelaus could have ruld his wyll, With fowle reproche to loose his faire delight, Then had the stately towres of Troy stoode styll, And Greekes with grudge had dronke their owne despight. If dread of drenching waves or feare of fire, Had stayde the wandring Prince amydde his race, Ascanius then, the fruite of his desire, In Lavine Lande had not possessed place. But true it is, where lottes doe lyght by chaunce, There Fortune helpes the boldest to advaunce. Sic tuli. The nexte was at request of Antony Kinwelmarshe, who delivered him this theame, Satis sufficit, and thereupon he wrote as foloweth. The vaine excesse of flattering fortunes giftes, Envenometh the minde with vanitye, And beates the restelesse braine with endlesse driftes, To staye the staffe of worldly dignitie: The begger standes in like extremitie. Wherfore to lacke the moste, and leave the least, I coumpt enough as good as any feast. By too too much Dan Crœsus caught his death, And bought with bloud the price of glittering gold, By too too litle many one lackes breath And sterves in stretes a mirroure to beholde: So pride for heate, and povertye pynes for colde. Wherefore to lacke the most, and leave the least I coumpt enough as good as any feast. Store makes no sore: loe this seemes contrarye, And mo the merier is a Proverbe eke, But store of sores maye make a maladye, And one to many maketh some to seeke, When two be mette that bankette with a leeke: Wherfore to lacke the most and leave the least, I coumpt enough as good as any feast. The rych man surfetteth by glottony, Which feedeth still, and never standes content, The poore agayne he pines for penurye, Which lives with lacke when all and more is spente: So to much and to little bothe bee shente. Wherefore to lacke the moste, and leave the least, I coumpt enough as good as any feast. The conquerour with uncontented swaye, Doth rayse up rebelles by his avarice, The recreaunt dothe yeeld himselfe a praye, To forraine spoyle by slouth and cowardyce: So too much and to little both be vyce. Wherefore to lacke the most, and leave the least, I coumpt enough as good as any feast. If so thy wife be too too fayre of face: It drawes one gest too many to thine inne: If she be fowle, and foyled with disgrace, In other pillowes prickst thou many a pinne: So fowle [prove] fooles, and fayrer fall to sinne. Wherfore to lacke the moste, and leave the least I coumpt enough as good as any feast. And of enough, enough, and nowe no more, Bycause my braynes no better can devise, When thinges be badde, a small summe maketh store, So of suche verse a fewe maye soone suffice: Yet still to this my weary penne replyes. That I sayde last, and though you like it least, It is enough and as good as a feast. Sic tuli. John Vaughan delivered him this theame. Magnum vectigal parcimonia, where uppon he wrote thus. The common speech is, spend and God will send, But what sendes he? a bottell and a bagge, A staffe a wallet and a wofull ende, For such as list in bravery so to bragge. Then if thou covet coyne enough to spend, Learne first to spare thy budget at the brinke, So shall the bottome be the faster bound: But he that list with lavish hand to linke, (In like expence) a pennye with a pound, May chaunce at last to sitte a side and shrinke His harbraind head with out dame dainties dore. Hick, [H]obbe, and Dick, with clouts upon their knee, Have many times more goonhole grotes in store And change of crownes more quicke at cal then he, Which let their lease and take their rent before. For he that rappes a royall on his cappe, Before he put one penny in his pursse, Had neede turne quicke and broch a better tappe, Or els his drinke may chance go downe the wursse. I not denie but some men have good hap, To climbe a lofte by scales of courtly grace, And winne the world with liberalitye: Yet he that yerks old angells out apace, And hath no newe to purchase dignitye, When orders fall, may chaunce to lacke his grace. For haggard hawkes mislike an emptie hand: So stiffely some sticke to the mercers stall, Till sutes of silke have swet out all their land. So ofte thy neighbours banquet in thy hall, Till Davie Debet in thy parler stand, And bids the welcome to thine owne decay. I like a Lions lookes not worth a leeke When every Foxe beguiles him of his praye: What sauce but sorrow serveth him a weeke, Which all his cates consumeth in one daye? First use thy stomacke to a stand of ale, Before thy Malmesey come in Marchantes bookes, And rather were (for shifte) thy shirte of male, Than teare thy silken sleves with teynter hokes, Put feathers in thy pillowes great and small, Let them be princkt with plumes, that gape for plummes, Heape up bothe golde and silver safe in hooches, Catche, snatche, and scratche for scrapings and for crommes Before thou decke thy hatte (on high) with brooches. Lette first thyne one hand hold faste all that commes, Before that other learne his letting flie: Remember still that soft fire makes sweet malte, No haste but good (who meanes to multiplye:) Bought witte is deare, and drest with sower salte, Repentaunce commes to late, and then saye I, Who spares the first and keepes the last unspent, Shall finde that sparing yeeldes a goodly rent. Sic tuli. Alexander Nevile delivered him this theame, Sat cito, si sat bene, whereupon hee compiled these seven Sonets in seq[u]ence, therin bewraying his owne Nimis cito: and therwith his Vix bene, as foloweth. [1] In haste poste haste, when first my wandring minde, Behelde the glistring Courte with gazing eye, Suche deepe delightes I seemde therin to finde, As might beguile a graver guest than I. The stately pompe of Princes and their peeres, Did seeme to swimme in flouddes of beaten goulde, The wanton world of yong delightfull yeeres, Was not unlyke a heaven for to behoulde. Wherin dyd swarme (for every saint) a Dame, So faire of hue, so freshe of their attire, As might excell dame Cinthia for Fame, Or conquer Cupid with his owne desire. These and suche lyke were baytes that blazed still Before myne eye to feede my greedy will. 2 Before mine eye to feede my greedy will, Gan muster eke mine olde acquainted mates, Who helpt the dish (of vayne delighte) to fill My empty mouth with dayntye delicates: And folishe boldenesse toke the whippe in hande, To lashe my life into this trustlesse trace, Til all in haste I leapte a loofe from lande, And hoyste up soyle to catche a Courtly grace: Eche lingring daye did seeme a world of wo, Till in that haplesse haven my head was brought: Waves of wanhope so tost me to and fro, In deepe dispayre to drowne my dreadfull thought: Eche houre a day eche day a yeare did seeme, And every yeare a worlde my will did deeme. 3 And every yeare a worlde my will did deeme, Till lo, at last, to Court nowe am I come, A seemely swayne, that might the place beseeme, A gladsome guest embraste of all and some: Not there contente with common dignitie, My wandring eye in haste, (yea poste poste haste) Behelde the blazing badge of braverie, For wante wherof, I thought my selfe disgraste: Then peevishe pride puffte up my swelling harte, To further foorth so hotte an enterprise: And comely cost beganne to playe his parte, In praysing patternes of mine owne devise. Thus all was good that might be got in haste, To princke me up, and make me higher plaste. 4 To prinke me up and make me higher plaste, All came to late that taryed any time, Pilles of provision pleased not my taste, They made my heeles to heavie for to clime: Mee thought it best that boughes of boystrous oake, Should first be shread to make my feathers gaye. Tyll at the last a deadly dinting stroake, Brought downe the bulke with edgetooles of decaye: Of every farme I then let flye a lease, To feede the purse that payde for peevishnesse, Till rente and all were falne in suche disease, As scarse coulde serve to mayntayne cleanlynesse: They bought, the bodie, fine, ferme, lease, and lande, All were to little for the merchauntes hande. 5 All were to little for the merchauntes hande, And yet my braverye bigger than his booke: But when this hotte accompte was coldly scande, I thought highe time about me for to looke: With heavie cheare I caste my head abacke, To see the fountaine of my furious race. Comparde my losse, my living, and my lacke, In equall balance with my jolye grace. And sawe expences grating on the grounde Like lumpes of lead to presse my pursse full ofte, When light rewarde and recompence were founde, Fleeting like feathers in the winde alofte: These thus comparde, I left the Courte at large, For why? the gaines doth seeldome quitte the charge. 6 For why? the gaines doth seldome quitte y? charge, And so saye I, by proofe too dearely bought, My haste mad wast, my brave and brainsicke barge, Did float to fast, to catch a thing of nought: With leasure, measure, meane, and many mo, I mought have kept a chayre of quiet state, But hastie heads can not bee setled so, Till croked Fortune give a crabbed mate: As busie braynes muste beate on tickle toyes, As rashe invention breedes a rawe devise, So sodayne falles doe hinder hastie joyes, And as swifte baytes doe fleetest fyshe entice. So haste makes waste, and therefore nowe I saye, No haste but good, where wisdome makes the waye. 7 No haste but good, where wisdome makes the waye, For profe whereof, behold the simple snayle, (Who sees the souldiers carcasse caste a waye, With hotte assaulte the Castle to assayle,) By line and leysure clymes the loftye wall, And winnes the turrettes toppe more conningly, Than doughtye Dick, who loste his life and all, With hoysting up his head to hastilye. The swiftest bitche brings foorth the blyndest whelpes, The hottest Fevers coldest crampes ensue, The nakedst neede hathe over latest helpes: With Nevyle then I finde this proverbe true, That haste makes waste, and therefore still I saye, No haste but good, where wisdome makes the waye. Sic tuli. Richarde Courtop (the last of the five) gave him this theame, Durum æneum &amp; miserabile ævum, and thereupon hee wrote in this wise. When peerelesse Princes courtes were free from flatterie, The Justice from unequal doome, the quest from perjurie, The pillers of the state, from proude presumption, The clearkes from heresie, the commones from rebellion: Then right rewardes were given, by swaye of dewe desarte, Then vertues derlinges might be plaste aloft to play their part: Then might they coumpt it true, that hath beene sayde of olde, The children of those happie dayes, were borne in beds of golde, And swadled in the same: the Nurse that gave them sucke, Was wife to liberallitie, and lemman to good lucke. When Cæsar woon the fielde, his captaines caught the Townes, And every painful souldiours purse was crammed ful of crownes. Licurgus for good Lawes, lost his owne libertie, And thought it better to preferre common commoditie. But nowe the times are turnde, it is not as it was, The golde is gone, the silver sunke, and nothing left but brasse. To see a King encroache, what wonder should it seeme, When commons cannot be content, with countrie Dyadeeme? The Prince maye dye a babe, trust up by trecherie, Where vaine ambition doth move trustlesse nobillitye. Errours in pulpit preache, where faith in priesthood failes, Promotion (not devotion) is cause why cleargie quailes. Thus is the stage stakt out, where all these partes be plaide, And I the prologue should pronounce, but that I am afraide. First Cayphas playes the Priest, and Herode sits as king, Pylate the Judge, Judas the Jurour verdict in doth bring, Vaine tatling plaies the vice, well cladde in ritche aray, And poore Tom Trooth is laught to skorn, with garments nothing gay. The woman wantonnesse, shee commes with ticing traine, Pride in hir pocket plaies bo peepe, and bawdry in hir braine. Hir handmaides be deceipte, daunger, and dalliaunce, Riot and Revell follow hir, they be of hir alliaunce: Next these commes in Sim Swashe, to see what sturre they keepe. Clim of the Clough then takes his heeles, tis time for him to creepe: To packe the pageaunt up, commes Sorrow with a song, He say[s] these jestes can get no grotes, &amp; al this geare goth wrong: Fyrst pride without cause why, he singes the treble parte, The meane hee mumbles out of tune, for lacke of life and hart: Cost lost, the counter Tenor chanteth on apace, Thus all in discords stands the cliffe, and beggrie singes the base. The players loose their paines, where so fewe pence are sturring, Their garm?ts weare for lacke of gains, &amp; fret for lack of furring. When all is done and past, was no part plaide but one, For everye player plaide the foole, tyll all be spent and gone. And thus this foolishe jest, I put in dogrell rime, Because a crosier staffe is best, for such a crooked time. Sic tuli. And thus an ende of these five Theames, admounting to the number of .CCLVIII. verses, devised ryding by the way, writing none of them untill he came at the ende of his Journey, the which was no longer than one day in ryding, one daye in tarying with his friend, and the thirde in returning to Greyes Inne: and therefore called Gascoignes memories. A gloze upon this text, Dominus iis opus habet. My recklesse race is runne, greene youth and pride be past, My riper mellowed yeeres beginne to follow on as fast. My glancing lookes are gone, which wonted were to prie, In everie gorgious garishe glasse, that glistred in mine eie. My sight is now so dimme, it can behold none such, No mirrour but the merrie meane, can please my fansie much. And in that noble glasse, I take delight to vewe, The fashions of the wonted world, compared by the newe. For marke who lyst to looke, eche man is for him selfe. And beates his braine to hord &amp; heape, this trashe &amp; worldly pelfe. Our handes are closed up, great giftes go not abroade, Fewe men wyll lende a locke of heye, but for to gaine a loade. Give Gave is a good man, what neede we lashe it out, The world is wondrous feareful now, for danger bids men doubt. And aske how chaunceth this? or what meanes all this meede? Forsoothe the common aunswere is, because the Lord hath neede. A noble jest by gisse, I finde it in my glasse, The same freeholde our saviour Christ, conveyed to his asse. A texte to trie the trueth, and for this time full fitte, Fo[r] where should we our lessons learne, but out of holy writte? First marke our onely God, which ruleth all the rost, He sets a side all pompe and pride, wherein fond wordlings boast. His trayne is not so great, as filthy Sathans band, A smaller heard maye serve to feede, at our great masters hand. Next marke the heathens Gods, and by them shall we see, They be not now so good fellowes, as they were wonte to be. Jove, Mars, and Mercurie, Dame Venus and the rest, They b?quet not as they were wont, they know it were not best. So kinges and princes both, have left their halles at large, Their privie chambers cost enough, they cut off every charge. And when an office falles, as chaunce somtimes maye bee, First kepe it close a yere or twayne, then geld it by the fee. And give it out at last, but yet with this proviso, (A bridle for a brainsicke Jade) durante bene placito. Some thinke these ladders low, to climbe alofte with speede: Well let them creepe at leisure th?, for sure the Lord hath neede. Dukes Earles and Barons bold, have learnt like lesson nowe, They breake up house &amp; come to courte, they live not by y? plowe. Percase their roomes be skant, not like their stately boure, A field bed in a corner coucht, a pallad on the floure. But what for that? no force, they make thereof no boast, They feede them selves with delycates, and at the princes cost. And as for all their men, their pages and their swaynes, They choke th? up with chynes of beefe, to multiply their gaines. Themselves lie neere to looke, when any leafe doth fall, Such cromes were wont to feede pore gromes, but nowe y? Lords licke al. And why? oh sir, because, both dukes &amp; lords have neede, I mocke not I, my text is true, beleeve it as your creede. Our Prelates and our Priests, can tell this text with mee, They can hold fast their fattest fermes, and let no lease go free. They have both wife and childe, which maye not be forgot, The scriptures say the Lord hath neede, and therfore blame them not. Then come a little lower, unto the contrye knight, The squire and the gentleman, they leave the countrye quite, Their Halles were all to large, their tables were to long, The clouted shoes came in so faste, they kepte to great a throng, And at the porters lodge, where lubbers wonte to feede, The porter learnes to answere now, hence hence the Lord hath neede. His gestes came in to thicke, their diet was to great, Their horses eate up all the hey, which should have fed his neate: Their teeth were farre to fine, to feede on porke and souse, Fyve flocks of sheepe could scarce maintaine good mutten for his house. And when this count was cast, it was no biding here, Unto the good towne is he gonne, to make his frends good cheere. And welcome there that will, but shall I tell you howe: At his owne dish he feedeth them, that is the fashion nowe, Side bords be layed aside, the tables ende is gonne, His cooke shall make you noble cheere, but hostler hath he none. The chargers now be changde, wherein he wont to eate, An olde frutedish is bigge ynough to hold a joynte of meate. A sallad or a sauce, to tast your cates with all, Som str?g devise to feede m?s eies, m?s stomacks now be small. And when the tenauntes come to paie their quarters rent, They bringe some fowle at Midsommer, a dish of Fish in Lent, At Christmasse a capon, at Mighelmasse a goose: And somewhat else at Newyeres tide, for feare their lease flie loose. Good reason by my troth, when Gentlemen lacke groates, Let Plowmen pinche it out for pence, &amp; patch their russet coates: For better Fermers fast, than Manner houses fall, The Lord hath neede, than says the text, bring old Asse colt &amp; all. Well lowest nowe at last, let see the contrye loute, And marke how he doth swink &amp; sweat, to bring this geare about: His feastinges be but fewe, cast whipstockes clout his shoone, The wheaten loafe is locked up as sone as dinners doone: And where he wonte to kepe a lubber, two or three, Now hath he learnd to kepe no more, but Sim his sonne and he, His wife and Mawde his mayd, a boye to pitch the carte, And turne him up at Hollontide, to feele the winter smarte: Dame Alyson his wife doth knowe the price of meale, Hir bride cakes be not halfe so bigge as she was wont to steale: She weares no silver hookes, she is content with worsse, Hir pendantes and hir silver pinnes she putteth in hir pursse. Thus learne I by my glasse, that merrie meane is best, And he most wise that finds the meane, to keepe himselfe at rest. Perchaunce some open mouth will mutter now and than, And at the market tell his mate, our landlordes a zore man: He racketh up our rentes, and keepes the best in hand, He makes a w?drous deale of good out of his own measne land: Yea let suche pelters prate, saint Needam be their speede, We neede no text to answer them, but this, The Lord hath nede. Ever or never. An Epitaph upon Captaine Bourcher late slaine in the warres in Zelande, the which hath bene termed the tale of a stone as foloweth. Fye Captaines fie, your tongues are tyed to close, Your Souldiours eke by silence purchase shame: Can no man penne in meetre nor in prose, The lyfe, the death, the valliaunt actes, the fame, The birth, behaviour, nor the noble name, Of such a feere as you in fight have lost: Alas such paines would quickly quite the cost. Bourcher is dead, whome eche of you dyd knowe, Yet no man writes one worde to paint his praise, His sprite on highe, his carkasse here belowe, Doth both condemne your doting ydle dayes: Yet ceasse they not to sounde his worthy wayes, Who lived to dye, and dyed againe to live, With death deere bought, he dyd his death forgive. Hee might for byrth have boasted noble race, Yet were his manners meeke and alwayes milde, Who gave a gesse by gazing on his face, And judgde thereby, might quickly be beguilde, In fielde a Lion, and in Towne a Childe, Fierce to his foe, but courteouse to his friende. Alas the while, his life so soone should ende? To serve his Prince his life was ever prest, To serve his God, his death he thought but dew, In all attempts as foreward as the best, And all to forewardes, which we all may rew, His life so shewed, his death eke tried it true: For where his foes in thickest prease dyd stande, Bourcher caught bane with bloodie sworde in hande. And marke the courage of a noble heart, When he in bed laye wounded wondrous sore, And heard allarme, he soone forgot his smart, And calde for armes to shewe his service more: I wyll to fielde (quod he) and God before. Which sayde, he sailde into more quiet coast, Styll praysing God, and so gave up the ghost. Nowe muze not reader though we stones can speake, Or write sometimes the deedes of worthy ones, I could not holde although my heart should breake, (Because here by me buryed are his bones,) But I must tell this tale thus for the nones When men crye mumme and keepe such silence long, Then stones must speake, els dead men shall have wrong. Finis quod Marmaduke Marblestone. A devise of a Maske for the right honorable Viscount Mountacute written upon this occasion, when the sayde L. had prepared to solemnize twoo marriages betweene his sonne and heyre, and the Daughter of syr William Dormer Knight, and betweene the sonne and heyre of syr William Dormer, and the Daughter of the said L. Mountacute: there were eight Gentlemen (all of blood or alliaunce to the sayd L. Mountacute) which had determined to present a Maske at the daye appointed for the sayd marriages, and so farre they had proceeded therein, that they had alreadye bought furniture of Silkes, &amp;c, and had caused their garmentes to bee cut of the Venetian fashion. Nowe then they began to imagine that (without some speciall demonstration) it would seeme somewhat obscure to have Venetians presented rather than other countrey men. Whereupon they entreated the Aucthour to devise some verses to bee uttered by an Actor wherein might be some discourse convenient to render a good cause of the Venetians presence. The Aucthour calling to minde that there is a noble house of the Mountacutes in Italie, and therwithall that the L. Mountacute here doth quarter the coate of an auncient English Gentleman called Mounthermer, and hath the inheritaunce of the sayde house, dyd thereupon devise to bring in a Boye of the age of twelve or .xiiii. yeeres, who should faine that he was a Mounthermer by the fathers side, and a Mountacute by the mothers side, and that his father being slaine at the last warres against the Turke, and he there taken, hee was recovered by the Venetians in their last victorie, and with them sayling towardes Venice, they were driven by tempest upon these coastes, and so came to the marriage upon report as followeth, and the sayde Boye pronounced the devise in this sort. What w?der you my Lords? why gaze you gentlemen? And wherefore marvaile you Mez Dames, I praye you tell mee then? Is it so rare a sight, or yet so straunge a toye, Amongst so many nooble peeres, to see one Pouer Boye? Why? boyes have bene allowed in everye kinde of age, As Ganymede that pretye boye, in Heaven is Jove his page. Cupid that mighty God although his force be fearse, Yet is he but a naked Boye, as Poets doe rehearse. And many a preetye boye a mightye man hath proved, And served his Prince at all assayes deserving to bee loved. Percase my strange attire my glittering golden gite, Doth eyther make you marvaile thus, or move you with delite. Yet wonder not my Lordes for if your honours please, But even to give me eare a while, I wyll your doubtes appease. And you shall knowe the cause, wherefore these roabes are worne, And why I goe outlandishe lyke, yet being Englishe borne. And why I thus presume to presse into this place, And why I (simple boye) am bolde to looke such men in face. Fyrst then you must perstande, I am no straunger I, But English boye, in England borne, and bred but even hereby. My father was a Knight, Mount Hermer was his name, My mother of the Mountacutes, a house of worthy fame. My father from his youth was trained up in field, And alwayes toke his chiefe delight, in helmet speare and shielde. Soldado for his life, and in his happie dayes, Soldado like hath lost his life, to his immortall prayse. The thundering fame which blewe about the worlde so wyde, Howe that the Christian enemye, the Turke that Prince of pride, Addressed had his power, to swarme uppon the Seas, With Gallies, foists, and such lik[e] ships, well armde at al assaies. And that he made his vaunt, the greedy fishe to glut, With gobs of Christian carkasses, in cruell peeces cut. These newes of this report, did pearce my fathers eares, But never touched his noble heart, with any sparke of feares. For well he knewe the trade of all the Turkishe warres, And had amongst them shed his blood, at many cruell jarres. In Rhodes his race begonne, a slender tal[l] yong man, Where he by many martiall feats, his spurres of knighthood wan. Yea though the peece was lost, yet won he honour styll, And evermore against the Turkes he warred by his wyll. At Chios many knowe, how hardily he fought, And howe with streames of stryving blood, his honoure deare hee bought. At length enforst to yeeld with many captaines mo, He bought his libertie with Landes, and let his goodes ago. Zechines A peece of golde like the Crusado. of glistering golde, two thousand was his price, The which to paye his landes must leape, for else he were unwise. Beleeve me nowe my Lordes although the losse be mine, Yet I confesse them better solde, than lyke a slave to pine. “For landes maye come againe, but lybertie once lost, “Can never finde such recompence, as countervailes the cost. My selfe now know the case, who lyke my fathers lot, Was lyke of late for to have lost my libertie God wot. My father (as I saye) enforste to leave his lande, In mortgage to my mothers kinne, for ready coyne in hande, Gan nowe upon these newes, which earst I dyd rehearse,] Prepare himselfe to save his pawne, or else to leese his phearce. And first his raunsome payde, with that which dyd remaine, He rigged up a proper Barke, was called Leffort Brittaine. And lyke a venturer (besides him seemely selfe) Determined for to venture me and all his worldly pelfe. Perhappes some hope of gaine perswaded so his minde, For sure his hauty heart was bent, some greate exploite to finde. Howe so it were, the windes nowe hoysted up our sailes, Wee furrowing in the foming flooddes, to take our best availes. Now hearken to my wordes, and marke you well the same, For nowe I wyll declare the cause, wherefore I hyther came. My father (as I saye) had set up all his rest, And tost on seas both daye and night, disdayning ydle rest, We left our forelandes ende, we past the coast of Fraunce, We reacht the cape of Finis Terre our course for to advaunce. We past Marrocchus streightes, and at the last descried, The fertile coastes of Cyprus soile, which I my selfe first spyed. My selfe (a foreward boye) on highest top was plast, And there I saw the Cyprian shoare, whereto we sayld in haste. Which when I had declared unto the masters mate, He lepte for joye and thanked God, of that our happy state. “But what remaines to man, that can continue long? “What sunne can shine so cleare &amp; bright but cloudes may ryse among? Which sentence soone was proved, by our unhappy hap, We thought our selves full neere our friendes, &amp; light in enemies lap. The Turke y? Tirant he, with siege had girte the walles, Of famous Famagosta The chiefe Cittie in Cyprus. then and sought to make them thralles. And as he laye by lande, in strong and stately trenche, So was his power prest by Sea, his Christian foes to drenche. Upon the waltring waves, his Foistes and Gallies fleete, More forrest like than orderly, for such a man most meete. This heavy sight once seene, we turnde our course apace, And set up al our sailes in haste, to give suche furie place. But out alas, our willes, and windes were contrarie, For raging blastes did blowe us still uppon our enimie. My father seeing then, whereto he needes must go, And that the mighty hand of God, had it appointed so, Most like a worthy knight (though certaine of his death) Gan cleane forget all wayling wordes, as lavishe of his breath. And to his Christian crewe, this (too shorte) tale he told, To comfort them which seemde to faint, &amp; make the coward bold, “Fellowes in armes, quod hee, although I beare the charge, “And take upon mee chieftaines name, of this unhappy barge, “Yet are you all my pheares, and as one companie, “Wee must like true companions, togeather live and die, “You see quod hee our foes, with furious force at hand, “And in whose handes our handfull heere, unable is to stand, “What resteth then to doe, should we unto them yeeld? “And wi[l]fully receive that yoke, which Christians cannot weld. “No sure, hereof be sure, our lives were so unsure, “And though we live, yet so to live, as better death endure. “To heare those hellishe fiendes in raging blasphemie, “Defye our onely Saviour, were this no miserie? “To see the fowle abuse of boyes in tender yeeres, “The which I knowe must needes abhorre all honest Christians eares. “To see maides ravished, Wives, Women forst by feare, “And much more mischiefe than this time can let me utter here. “Alas, quod he, I tell not all, my tongue is tyde, “But all the slaveries on the earth, we should with them abide. “How much were better than, to dye in worthy wise, “And so to make our carkasses, a wylling Sacrifice? “So shall we paye the debt, which unto God is due, “So shall you die in his defence, who deind to die for you. “And who with hardy hand, most Turkish tikes can quell, “Let him accompt in conscience, to please his maker well. “You see, quod he, my sonne, wherewith hee lookt on mee, “Whome but a babe, yet have I brought, my partner here to bee. “For him, I must confesse, my heart is pensive nowe, “To leave him lyving thus in youth, to die I know not how. “But since it pleaseth God, I may not murmure I, “If God had pleased we both should live, and as God wyll we dye. Thus with a braying sigh, his noble tongue he stayde, Commaunding all the ordinaunce, in order to be laide. And placing all his men in order for to fight, Fell groveling styll upon his face, before them all in sight. And when in secreete so, he whispered had a while, He raisde his head with cheerefull looke, his sorrowes to beguile: And with the rest he prayde, to God in heaven on hie, Which ended thus, Thou onely Lord, canst helpe in miserie. This sayd (behold) the Turkes enclosde us round about, And seemde to wonder that we durst resist so great a rout. Wherat they doubt not long, for though our power was slender, We sent them signes by Canon shot, that we ment not to render. Then might we see them chafe, then might we heare them rage, And all at once they bent their force, about our silly cage. Our ordinaunce bestowed, our men them selves defend, On every side so thicke beset, they might not long contend. But as their captaine wilde, eche man his force did strayne, To send a Turke (some two or three) unto the hellishe trayne, And he himselfe which sawe, he might no more abide, Did thrust amide the thickest throng, and so with honour died. With him there dyed like wise, his best aproved men, The rest did yeeld as men amazd, they had no courage then. Amongest the which my selfe, was tane by Turkes alas, And with the Turkes a turkish life, in Turkie must I passe. I was not done to death for so I often cravde, But like a slave before the Gattes, of Famagosta savde. That peece once put to sacke, I thither was conveyed, And under savegard evermore, I silly boye was stayed. There dyd I see such sightes, as yet my heart do pricke, I sawe the noble The governour of Famagosta. Bragadine, when he was fleyd quicke. First like a slave enforst to beare to every breach, Two baskets laden full with earth The generall of the Turkes. Mustaffa dyd him teach. By whome he might not passe before he kyst the grounde, These cruell tormentes (yet with mo) that worthy souldior found. His eares cut from his head, they set him in a chayre, And from a maine yard hoisted him aloft into the ayre, That so he might be shewed with crueltie and spight, Unto us all, whose weeping eyes dyd much abhorre the sight. Alas why do I thus with woefull wordes rehearse, These werye newes which all our heartes with pittie needes must pearce? Well then to tell you forth, I styll a slave remaind, To one, which Prelybassa hight, who held me styll enchaind. With him I went to Seas into the gulfe of Pant, With many christians captives mo, which dyd their freedom w?t. There with the Turkishe traine we were enforst to staye, With waltring styll upon the waves, dyd waite for furder praye. For why? they had advise, that the Venetian fleete, Dyd floote in Argostelly then, with whome they hopte to meete. And as they waltered thus with tides and billowes tost, Their hope had hap, for at the last they met them to their cost. As in October last uppon the seventh daye, They found the force of christian knightes addrest in good aray. And shall I trie my tong to tell the whole discourse, And howe they did encounter first, and howe they joynd in force? Then harken nowe my lords, for sure my memorye, Doth yet recorde the very plot of all this victorye, The christian crew came on, in forme of battayle pight, And like a cressent cast them selves preparing for to fight. On other side the Turkes, which trusted power to much, Disorderly did spread their force, the will of God was such. Well at the last they met, and first with cannones thunder, Eache other sought with furious force to slit their ships in sunder. The barkes are battered sore, the gallies gald with shot, The hulks are hit, and every man must stand unto his lot. The powder sendes his smoke into the cruddy skies, The smoulder stops our nose with stench, the fume offends our eies. The pots of lime unsleakt, from highest top are cast, The parched pease are not for got to make them slip as fast. The wilde fire works are wrought and cast in foemens face, The grappling hooks are stretched foorth, y? pikes are pusht a pace. The halbert[s] hewe on hed, the browne billes bruse the bones, The harquebush doth spit his spight, with prety persing stones. The drummes crie dub a dub, the braying trumpets blow, The whistling fifes are seldom herd, these sounds do drowne th? so. The voyce of warlike wights, to comfort them that faynt, The pitious plaints of golden harts, which were with feares attaint. The groning of such ghosts as gasped nowe for breath, The praiers of the better sort, prepared unto death. And to be short, eache griefe which on the earth maye growe, Was eath and easie to be found, upon these floudes to flowe. If any sight on earth, maye unto hell resemble, Then sure this was a hellishe sighte, it makes me yet to tremble: And in this bloudie fight, when halfe the daye was spent, It pleazed God to helpe his flocke, which thus in po?d was pent. The generall of Spayne, gan gald that galley sore, Where in my Prely Bassa was, and grievde it more and more: Upon that other side, with force of sworde and flame, The good Venetian Generall dyd charge upon the same. At leength they came aboorde, and in his raging pride, Stroke of this Turkish captains head, which blasphemd as it dide: Oh howe I feele the bloud now trickle in my brest, To thinke what joye then pierst my heart, and how I thought me blest. To see that cruell Turke which held me as his slave, By happie hand of Christians, his paiment thus to have: His head from shoulders cut, upon a Pike dyd stand, The which Don John of Austrye, helde in his triumphant hand. The boldest Bassa then, that dyd in life remaine, Gan tremble at the sight hereof, for privy griefe and paine. Thus when these fierce had fought, from morning untyl night, Christ gave his flocke the victory, and put his foes to flight: And of the Turkishe traine, were eyght score Galleys tane, Fifteene sunke, five and twenty burnt, &amp; brought unto their bane, Of Christians set at large were foureteene thousand soules, Turkes twentie thousand registred in Belzebub his rolles. Thus have you nowe my Lordes, the summe of all their fight, And trust it all for true I tell, for I was styll in sight: But when the Seas were calme, and skies began to cleare, When foes were all or dead or fled, and victors dyd appeare. Then every Christian sought amongst us for his friende, His kinsman or companion, some succour them to lende: And as they ransakte so, loe God his wyll it was, A noble wise Venetian, by me dyd chaunce to passe: Who gazing on my face, dyd seeme to lyke me well, And what my name, and whence I was, commaunded me to tel: I now which waxed bolde, as one that scaped had, From deepest hell to highest heaven, began for to be glad: And with a lively sprite, began to pleade my case, And hid not from this worthy man, myne auntient worthy race: And tolde my fathers name, and howe I dyd descende, From Mountacutes by Mothers side, nor there my tale dyd ende. But furthermore I tolde my Fathers late exployte, And how he left [landes,] goodes &amp; life, to pay son Dieu son droit. Nor of my selfe I craved so credited to bee, For lo there were remaining yet, These foure whom here you see. The foure torche bearers, that came in with the Actor.Which all were Englishe borne, and knewe I had not lyed, And were my Fathers souldiors eke, and sawe him how he dyed. This grave Venetian who heard the famous name, Of Mountacutes rehersed there, which long had bene of fame In Italy, and he of selfe same worthy race, Gan straight with many curteous words, in arms me to imbrace. And kyssed me on cheeke, and bad me make good cheere, And thank the mighty hand of God, for that which hapned there, Confessing that he was him selfe a Mountacute, And bare the selfe same armes that I dyd quarter in my scute: And for a further proofe, he shewed in his hat, This token which the Mountacutes dyd beare alwaies, for that The Actor had a token in his cap like to the Mountacutes of Italie. They covet to be knowne from Capels where they passe, For auncient grutch which l?g ago, twene these two houses was. Then tooke me by the hand, and ledde me so aboorde, His Galley: where there were yfeere, full many a comely Lorde: Of whome eyght Mountacutes dyd sitte in highest place, To whom this first declared first my name, and then my race: Lo Lordings here (quod he) a babe of our owne bloods, Wh? Turks had tane, his father slaine, with losse of lands &amp; goods: See how God favours us, that I should find him nowe, I straunge to him, he straunge to mee, we met I know not howe. But sure when I him saw, and gazed in his face, Me thought he was a Mountacute, I chose him by his grace. Herewith he dyd rehearse my Fathers valiaunt deede, For losse of whome eche Mountacute, did seeme in heart to bleede. They all embrast me then, and straight as you may see, In comely garments trimde me up, as brave as brave may bee: I was in sackcloath I, nowe am I cladde in Golde, And weare such roabes, as I my selfe take pleasure to beholde. The token that he dyd weare in his cappe. The Montacutes and capels in Italye do were tokens in their cappes to be knowen one from another. Amongst their other giftes, this token they me gave, And bad me lyke a Mountacute, my selfe alway behave. Nowe hearken then my Lordes, I staying on the Seas In consort of these lovely Lordes, with comfort and with ease, Determined with them in Italie to dwell, And there by traine of youthfull yeeres in knowledge to excell. That so I might at last reedifye the walles, Which my good father had decaide by tossing fortunes balles. And while they slice the Seas to their desired shore, Beholde a lytle gale began, encreasing more and more. At last with raging blast, which from Southeast dyd blowe, Gan sende our sailes upon these shores, which I ful wel did know. I spyed the Chalkie Clyves upon the Kentishe coast, Whereby our Lande hight Albyon, as Brutus once dyd boast. Which I no sooner sawe, but to the rest I sayde, Siate di buona voglia, My Lordes be well apaide: I see by certaine signes these Tempestes have us cast, Upon my native countrey coastes with happy hap at last: And if your honours please this honour me to doo, In Englishe havens to harbour you, and see our Citties too: Lo London is not farre, whereas my friendes would bee, Right glad, with favour to requite your favour shewed to mee: Vouchsafe my Lordes (quod I) to stay upon this strand, And whiles your Barks be rigged new, remaine with me on land. Who though I bee a Boye, my Father dead and slaine, Yet shall you see I have some friendes which wyll you entertaine. These Noble men which are, the flowre of curtesie, Dyd not disdaine this my request, but tooke it thankfullie. And from their battered Barkes commaunded to be cast, Some Venetian botes. Gondalaes, wherin upon our pleasant streames they past. Into the mo[u]th of Thames, thus dyd I them transport, And to London at the last, whereas I heard report, Even as we landed first, of this twise happie day, To thinke whereon I leapt for joye, as I both must and may. And to these lovely Lordes, which are Magnificoes, I dyd declare the whole discourse in order as it rose: That you my Lorde who are the chiefest Mountacute, And he whome Englishe Mountacutes their onely staye impute, Had found the meanes this daye to match your sonne and heire, In marriage with a worthy dame, which is both fresh and faire, And (as reportes are spread) of goodly quallyties, A virgin trayned from hir youth in godly exercise, Whose brother had like wise your daughter tane to wife, And so by double lynkes enchaynde themselves in lovers life: These noble Mountacutes which were from Venice droven, By tempest (as I tolde before) wherewith they long had stroven, Gan nowe give thankes to God which so did them convay, To see such honours of their kinne in such a happie day. And straight they mee intreat, whom they might wel commaund, That I should come to you my Lord, first them to recommaund, And then this boone to crave, that under your protection, They might be bolde to enter here, devoyd of all suspection, And so in friendly wise for to conselebrate, This happie match solemnized, according to your state. Lo this is all they crave, the which I can not doubt, But that your Lordship soone will graunt, with more, if more ye mought: Yea were it for no more, but for the Curtesie, Which as I saye they shewde to me in greate extremitye: They are Venetians, and though from Venice reft, They come in such Venecian robes, as they on seas had left: And since they be your friendes, and kinsmen too by blood, I trust your entretainement will be to them right good: They will not tarry long, to nowe I heare their drumme, Behold, lo nowe I see them here, in order howe they come, Receive them well my lord, so shall I praye all wayes, That God vouchsafe to blesse this house with many happie days. After the maske was done, the Actor tooke master Tho. Bro. by the hand an[d] brought him to the Venetians, with these words Guardate Signori my lovely Lords behold, This is another Mountacute, hereof you may bee bold. Of such our patrone here, The viscont Mountacute, Hath many comely sequences, well sorted all in sute. But as I spied him first, I could not let him passe, I tooke the carde that likt me best, in order as it was. And here to you my lords, I do present the same, Make much of him, I pray you then, for he is of your name. For whome I dare advante, he may your Trounchman bee, Your herald and ambassadour, let him play all for me. Then the Venetians embraced and received the same maister Tho. Browne, and after they had a while whispered with him, he torned to the Bridegroomes and Brides, saying thus. Brother, these noblemen to you nowe have me sent, As for their Trounchman to expound the effect of their intent. They bid me tell you then, they like your worthy choyce, And that they cannot choose therin but triumph and rejoyce. As farre as gesse may give, they seeme to praise it well, They saye betweene your Ladyes eyes, doth Gentilezza dwell. I terme it as they doo, their english is but weake, And I (God knowes) am al to yong, beyond sea speach to speake. And you my sister eke they seeme for to commend, With such good wor[d]es as may beseeme a cosin and a friend. They lyke your chosen pheare, so praye they for your sake, That he maye alwayes be to you, a faythfull loving make. This in effect is all, but that they crave a boone, That you will give them licence yet, to come and see you soone. Then will they speake them selves, such english as they can, I feare much better then I speake, that am an english man. Lo nowe they take their leaves of you and of your dames, Here after shal you see their face and knowe them by their nam[e]s. Then when they had taken their leaves the Actor did make an ende thus. And I your Servidore, vi bascio le mani, These wordes I learnt amongst them yet, although I learnt not many. Haud ictus sapio. The refusal of a lover, writen to a gentlewoman who had refused him and chosen a husband (as he thought) much inferior to himselfe, both in knowledge, birth, and parsonage, wherin he bewraieth both their names in clowdes, and how she was won from him with swete gloves, and broken ringes. I cannot wish thy griefe, although thou worke my wooe, Since I profest to be thy friend, I cannot be thy foe: But if thinges done and past, might well be cald agayne, Then would I wishe the wasted wordes, which I have spent in vayne: Were yet untold to thee, in earnest or in game, And that my doubtfull musing mind, had never thought y? same. For whiles I thee beheld, in carefull thoughtes I spent, My liking lust, my luckelesse love which ever truely ment. And whiles I sought a meane, by pittie to procure, Too latte I found that gorged haukes, do not esteme the lure. This vauntage hast thou then, thou mayest wel brag and boast. Thou mightest have had a lustye lad of stature with the most, And eke of noble mind: his vertues nothing base, Do well declare that he desends, of auncient worthy race. Save that I Know not not his name, and though I could it tell, My friendly pen shall let it passe, bicause I love him well. And thou hast chosen one of meaner parentage, Of stature smale and therewithall, unequall for thine age. His Good qualities. thewes unlike the first, yet hast thou hote desire, To play thee in his flitting flames, God graunt they prove not fire. Him holdest thou as deare, and he thy Lord shall bee, (Too late alas) thou lovest him, that never loved thee. And for just profe hereof, marke what I tell is true, Some dismold daye shall chaunge his minde, and make him seeke a new. Then wylt thou much repent, thy bargaine made in haste, And much lament those perfumd Gloves, which yeeld such sower taste, And eke the falsed faith, which lurkes in broken ringes, Though hand in hand say otherwise, yet do I know such thinges. Then shalt thou sing and saye, farewell my trusty Squyer, Would God my mind had yeelded once, unto thy just desire. Thus shalt thou wayle my want, and I thy great unrest, Which cruel Cupid kindled hath, within thy broken brest. Thus shalt thou find it griefe, which earst thou thoughtest game, And I shall heare the wearie newes, by true reporting fame. Lamenting thy mishap, in source of swelling teares, Harding my heart with cruell care, which frosen fansie beares. And though my just desert, thy pittie could not move, Yet wyl I washe in wayling wordes, thy careles childishe love. And saye as Troylus sayde, since that I can no more, Thy wanton wyll dyd waver once, and woe is me therefore. Si fortunatus infœlix. Pride in Court written by a Gentlewoman in Court, who (when shee was there placed) seemed to disdaine him, contrarie to a former profession. When daunger keepes the doore, of Ladye bewties bowre, Wh? jelouse toyes have chased Trust out of hir str?gest towre. Then faith and trooth maye flye, then falshood winnes the field, Then feeble naked fautlesse heartes, for lacke of fence must yeeld. And then prevailes as much to hoppe against the hyll, As seeke by suite for to appease a froward Ladies wyll. For oathes and solempne vowes, are wasted then in vaine, And truth is compted but a toye, when such fond fancies raigne. The sentence sone is sayde, when will it selfe is Judge, And quickly is the quarrell pickt, when Ladies list to grudge. This sing I for my selfe, (which wroate this weary song) Who justly may complaine my case, if ever man had wrong. A Lady have I serv'd, a Lady have I lov'd, A Ladies good wyll once I had, hir yll wyll late I prov'd. In countrey first I knewe hir, in countrey first I caught hir, And out of countrey nowe in Court, to my cost have I sought hir. In Court where Princes raigne, hir place is nowe assignde, And well were worthy for the roome, if she were not unkinde. There I (in wonted wise) dyd shewe my selfe of late, And found that as the soile was chang'd, so love was turnd to hate. But why? God knowes, not I: save as I sayde before, Pitie is put from porters place, and daunger keepes the dore. If courting then have skill, to chaunge good Ladies so, God send eche wilful Dame in Court, some wound of my like wo. That with a troubled head, she may both turne and tosse, In restlesse bed when she should sleepe and feele of love the losse. And I (since porters put me from my wonted place) And deepe deceipte hath wrought a wyle to wrest me out of grace: Wyll home againe to cart, as fitter were for mee, Then thus in court to serve and starve, where such proude porters bee. Si fortunatus infœlix. This question being propounded by a Dame unto the Aucthour, to witte, why he should write Spreta tamen vivunt, he aunswereth thus. Despysed things may live, although they pine in payne: And things ofte trodden under foote, may once yet rise againe. The stone that lieth full lowe, may clime at last full hye: And stand a loft on stately towr's, in sight of every eye. The cruell Axe which felles the tree that grew full straight: Is worne with rust, when it renewes, and springeth up on height. The rootes of rotten Reedes in swelling seas are seene: And when eche tide hath tost his worst, they grow againe ful greene. Thus much to please my selfe, unpleasauntly I sing. And shrich to ease my morning minde, in spite of envies sting. I am nowe set full light, who earst was dearely lov'd: Som new fo?d choise is more estemd, than y? which wel was prov'd. Some Diomede is crept into Dame Cressides hart: And trustie Troylus nowe is taught in vaine to playne his part. What resteth then for me? but thus to wade in wo: And hang in hope of better chaunce, when chaunge appointeth so. I see no sight on earth, but it to Chaunge enclines: As litle clowdes oft overcast, the brightest Sunne that shines. No Flower is so freshe, but frost can it deface: No man so sure in any seate, but he maye leese his place. So that I stand content (though much against my mind) To take in worth this lothsome lot, which luck to me assynd, And trust to see the time, when they that nowe are up: May feele the whirle of fortunes wheele, and tast of sorrowes cup. God knoweth I wishe it not, it had bene bet for mee: Styll to have kept my quiet chayre in hap of high degree. But since without recure, Dame Chaunge in love must raigne: I now wish chaunge that sought no cha?ge, but const?t did remaine. And if suche chaunge do chaunce, I vowe to clap my hands, And laugh at them which laught at me: lo thus my fansie standes. Spreta tamen vivunt. In trust is Treason, written by a Lover, leaning onelye to his Ladies promises, and finding them to fayle. The straightest Tree that growes upon one onely roote: If that roote fayle, wyll quickly fade, no props can do it boote. I am that fading plant, which on thy grace dyd growe, Thy grace is gone wherefore I mone, and wither all in woe. The tallest ship that sailes, if shee too Ancors trust: When Ancors slip &amp; Cables breake, her helpe lyes in the dust. I am the ship my selfe, mine Ancor was thy faith: Which now is fled, thy promise broke, &amp; I am driven to death. Who climeth oft on hie, and trusts the rotten bowe: If that bow breake may catch a fall, such state stand I in now. Me thought I was a loft, and yet my seate full sure: Thy heart dyd seeme to me a rock which ever might endure. And see, it was but sand, whome seas of subtiltie: Have soked so with wanton waves, that faith was forst to flye. The flooddes of ficklenesse have undermined so, The first foundation of my joy, that myrth is ebb'd to wo. Yet at lowe water markes, I lye and wayte my time: To mend the breach, but all in vaine, it cannot passe the prime. For when the prime flood comes, which all this rage begoon: Then waves of wyll do worke so fast, my piles are over roon. Dutie and dilligence which are my workmen there, Are glad to take up tooles in haste, and run away for feare. For fansie hath such force, it overfloweth all, And whispring tales do blow the blasts, that make it ryse &amp; fall. Thus in these tempests tost, my restles life doth stand: Because I builded on thy wo[rd]es, as I was borne in hand. Thou weart that only stake, wereby I ment to stay: Alas, alas, thou stoodst so weake, the hedge is borne away. By thee I thought to live, by thee now must I dye: I made thee my Phisicion, thou art my mallady. For thee I longde to live, for thee nowe welcome death: And welcome be that happie pang, that stops my gasping breath. Twise happie were that axe, would cut my rotes downe right: And sacred were that swelling sea, which would consume me quight. Blest were that bowe would breake to bring downe climing youth, Which craks aloft, and quakes full oft, for feare of thine untruth. Ferenda Natura. The constancie of a lover hath thus sometimes bene briefly declared. That selfe same tonge which first did thee entreat To linke thy liking with my lucky love: That trustie tonge must nowe these wordes repeate, I love thee still, my fancie cannot move. That dreadlesse hart which durst attempt the thought To win thy will with mine for to consent, Maintaines that vow which love in me first wrought, I love thee still, and never shall repent. That happie hande which hardely did touch, Thy tender body to my deepe delight: Shall serve with sword to prove my passion such As loves thee still, much more than it can write. Thus love I still with tongue, hand, hart and all, And when I chaunge, let vengeance on me fall. Ferenda Natura. The fruite of foes written to a Gentlewoman, who blamed him for writing his friendly advise in verse unto another lover of hyrs. The cruell hate which boyles within thy burning brest, And seekes to shape a sharpe revenge, on them y? love thee best: May warne all faithfull friendes, in case of jeopardie, Howe they shall put their harmelesse hands, betweene the barck &amp; tree. And I among the rest, which wrote this weary song, Must nedes alledge in my defence, that thou hast done me wrong. For if in simple verse, I chaunc'd to touch thy name, And toucht the same without reproch, was I therefore to blame? And if (of great good will) I gave my best advise, Then thus to blame without cause why, me thinkes thou art not wise. Amongst olde written tales, this one I beare in mind, A simple soule much like my selfe, dyd once a serpent find. Which (almost dead for colde) lay moyling in the myre, When he for pittie tooke it up, and bro[u]ght it to the fyre. No sooner was the Snake, recured of hir griefe, But straight shee sought to hurt the man, that lent hir such reliefe. Such Serpent seemest thou, such simple soule am I, That for the weight of my good wil, am blam'd without cause why. But as it best beseemes, the harmelesse gentle hart, Rather to take an open wrong, than for to plaine his part: I must and will endure, thy spite without repent, The blame is mine, the triumph thine, and I am well content. Meritum petere, grave. A Lover often warned, and once againe droven into fantasticall flames by the chase of company, doth thus bewayle his misfortunes. I that my race of youthfull yeeres had roon, Alwayes untyed, and not (but once) in thrall, Even I which had the fieldes of freedome woon, And liv'd at large, and playde with pleasurs ball: Lo nowe at last am tane agayne and taught, To tast such sorowes, as I never sought. I love, I love, alas I love indeede, I crie alas but no man pityes me: My woundes are wide, yet seme they not to bleed, And hidden woundes are hardly heald we see. Such is my lucke to catch a sodain clappe, Of great mischaunce in seeking my good happe. My morning minde which dwelt and dyed in dole, Sought company for solace of the same: My cares were cold, and craved comforts coale, To warme my will with flakes of friendly flame. I sought and found, I crav'd and did obtaine, I woon my wish, and yet I got no gaine. For whiles I sought the cheare of company, Fayre fellowship did wonted woes revive: And craving medcine for my maladie, Dame pleasures plasters prov'd a corosive. So that by myrth, I reapt no fruite but mone, Much worse I fere, than when I was alone. The cause is this, my lot did light to late, The Byrdes were flowen before I found the nest: The steede was stollen before I shut the gate, The cates consumd, before I smelt the feast. And I fond foole with emptie hand must call, The gorged Hauke, which likes no lure at all. Thus still I toyle, to till the barraine land, And grope for grappes among the bramble briers: I strive to saile and yet I sticke on sand, I deeme to live, yet drowne in deepe desires. These lottes of love, are fitte for wanton will, Which findes too much, yet must be seeking still. Meritum petere grave. The lover encouraged by former examples, determineth to make vertue of necessitie. When I record with in my musing mind, The noble names of wightes bewicht in love: Such solace for my selfe therin I finde, As nothing maye my fixed fansie move: But paciently I will endure my wo, Because I see the heavens ordayne it so. For whiles I read and ryfle their estates, In every tale I note mine owne anoye: But whiles I marke the meanings of their mates, I seeme to swime in such a sugred joye, As did (parcase) entise them to delight, Though turnd at last, to drugges of sower despite. Peruse (who list) Dan Davids perfect deedes, There shall he find the blot of Bersabe, Wheron to thinke, my heavy hart it bleedes, When I compare my love like hir to be: Urias wife before mine eyes that shines, And David I, from dutie that declines. Then Salomon this princely Prophetes sonne, Did Pharaos daughter make him fall or no? Yes, yes, perdie his wisdome coulde not shoone, Hir subtill snares, nor from hir counsell go. I nam Am not. (as hee) the wisest wight of all, But well I wot, a woman holdes me thrall. So am I lyke the proude Assirian Knight, Which blasphem'd God, and all the world defied: Yet could a woman overcome his might, And daunt his force in all his Pompe and Pride. I Holiferne, am dronken brought to bead, My love lyke Judith, cutting of my head. If I were strong, as some have made accompt, Whose force is like to that which Sampson had? If I be bolde, whose courage can surmount, The heart of Hercules, which nothing drad? Yet Dalila, and Deyanyraes love, Dyd teach them both, such panges as I must prove. Well let these passe, and thinke on Nasoes name, Whose skilfull verse dyd flowe in learned style: Dyd hee (thinke you) not dote upon his Dame? Corinna fayre, dyd shee not him beguile? Yes God he knowes, for verse nor pleasaunt rymes, Can constant keepe, the key of Cressides crimes. So that to ende my tale as I began, I see the good, the wise, the stoute, the bolde: The strongest champion and the learnedst man, Have bene and bee, by lust of love controlde. Which when [I] thinke, I hold me well content, To live in love, and never to repent. Meritum petere, grave. The delectable history of sundry adventures passed by Dan Bartholmew of Bathe. The Reporter. To tell a tale without authoritye, Or fayne a Fable by invencion, That one proceedes of quicke capacitye, That other proves but small discretion, Yet have both one and other oft bene done. And if I were a Poet as some be, You might perhappes here some such tale of me. But far I fynde my feeble skyll to faynt, To faine in figurs as the learned can, And yet my tongue is tyde by due constraint, To tell nothing but trueth of every man: I will assay even as I first began, To tell you nowe a tale and that of truth, Which I my selfe sawe proved in my youth. I neede not seeke so farre in costes abrode, As some men do, which write strange historyes, For whiles at home I made my cheife abode And sawe our lovers plaie their Tragedyes, I found enough which seemed to suffice, To set on worke farre finer wittes than mine, In paynting out the pangs which make them pine. Amongst the rest I most remember one Which was to me a deere familyar friend, Whose doting dayes since they be paste and gone, And his annoye (neare) come unto an ende, Although he seeme his angry brow to bend, I wyll be bold (by his leave) for to tell, The restlesse state wherein he long dyd dwell. Learned he was, and that became him best, For though by birth he came of worthy race, Yet beutie, byrth, brave personage, and the rest, In every choyce, must needes give learning place: And as for him he had so hard a grace, That by aspect he seemde a simple man, And yet by learning much renowne he wan. His name I hide, and yet for this discourse, Let call his name Dan Bartholmew of Bathe, Since in the ende he thither had recourse, And (as he sayd) dyd skamble there in skathe: In deede the rage which wrong him there, was rathe, As by this tale I thinke your selfe will gesse, And then (with me) his lothsome lyfe confesse. For though he had in all his learned lore, Both redde good rules to bridle fantasie, And all good authours taugh[t] him evermore, To love the meane, and leave extremitie, Yet kind hath lent him such a qualitie, That at the last he quite forgat his bookes, And fastned fansie with the fairest lookes. For proofe, when greene youth lept out of his eye, And left him now a man of middle age, His happe was yet with wandring lookes to spie, A fayre yong impe of proper personage, Eke borne (as he) of honest parentage: And truth to tell, my skill it cannot serve, To praise hir bewtie as it dyd deserve. First for hir head, the heeres were not of Gold, But of some other metall farre more fine, Whereof eache crinet seemed to behold, Like glistring wiers against the Sunne that shine, And therewithall the blazing of hir eyne, Was like the beames of Titan, truth to tell, Which glads us all that in this world do dwell. Upon hir cheekes the Lillie and the Rose, Did entremeete, with equall change of hewe, And in hir giftes no lacke I can suppose, But that at last (alas) she was untrue, Which flinging fault, bicause it is not new, Nor seldome seene in kits of Cressides kind, I marvaile not, nor beare it much in mind. Dame Natures fruits, wherewith hir face was fraught, Were so frost bitten with the cold of craft, That all (save such as Cupides snares had caught) Might soone espie the fethers of his shaft: But Bartholmew his wits had so bedaft, That all seemd good which might of hir be gotten, Although it provde no sooner ripe than rotten. That mouth of hirs which seemde to flowe with mell, In speeche, in voice, in tender touch, in tast, That dympled chin wherein delight dyd dwell, That ruddy lippe wherein was pleasure plast, Those well shapt hands, fine armes and slender wast, With al the giftes which gave hir any grace, Were smiling baites which caught fond fooles apace. Why strive I then to paint hir name with praise? Since forme and fruites were found so farre unlyke, Since of hir cage Inconstance kept the keyes, And Change had cast hir honoure downe in dike: Since fickle kind in hir the stroke did strike, I may no prayse unto a knife bequeath, With rust yfret, though paynted be the sheath. But since I must a name to hir assigne, Let call hir now Ferenda Natura, And if thereat she seeme for to repine, No force at all, for hereof am I sure a, That since hir prankes were for the most unpure a, I can appoint hir well no better name, Than this where in dame Nature bears the blame. And thus I say, when Bartholmew had spent His pride of youth (untide in linkes of love) Behold how happe contrary to intent, (Or destenies ordained from above, From which no wight on earth maye well remove) Presented to his vew this fierie dame, To kindle coles where earst had bene no flame. Whome when he sawe to shine in seemely grace, And therewithall gan marke hir tender youth, He thought not like, that under such a face She could convey the treason of untruth: Whereby he vowed (alas the more his ruth) To serve this saynt for terme of all his life, Lo here both roote and rind of all his strife. I cannot nowe in loving termes displaye His suite, his service, nor his sorie fare: His observaunces, nor his queynt aray, His skalding sighes, nor yet his cooling care, His wayting still to snatch himselfe in snare, I can not write what was his sweetest soure, For I my selfe was never Paramoure. But to conclude, much worth in litle writte, The highest flying hauke will stoupe at laste, The wildest beast is drawne with hungrye bitte To eate a homlye bayte some times in hast. The pricke of kinde can never be unplaste, And so it seemed by this dayntye dame, Whome he at last with labour did reclame. And when he had with mickel payne procured The calme consent of hir unweldie will, When he had hir by faith and troth assured, To like him beste, and aye to love him still, When fansie had of flatterie fedde his fill, I not discerne to tell my tale aright, What man but he had ever such delight? The lingring dayes he spent in trifling toyes, To whette the tooles which carved his contente: The poasting nightes he past in pleasing joyes, Wearing the webbe which love to him had lente: In such a pinfolde were his pleasures pent That selde he could hir company eschewe, Or leave such lookes as might his Lacke. sport renewe. But if by force he forced were to parte, Then mighte you see howe fansie fedde his minde, Then all alone he mused on his marte. All company seemde then (but hirs) unkind: Then sent he tokens true love for to bind, Then wrote he letters, lines and loving layes, So to beguile his absent dolefull dayes. And since I know as others eake can tell, What skyll he had, and howe he could endite, Mee thinkes I cannot better doe than well, To set downe here, his ditties of delyght, For so at least I maye my selfe acquite, And vaunt to shewe some verses yet unknowne, Well worthy prayse though none of them myne owne. No force for that, take you them as they be, Since mine emprice is but to make report: Imagine then, before you that you see A wight bewitcht in many a subtile sort, A Lover lodgd in pleasures princely port, Vaunting in verse what joyes he dyd possesse, His triumphes here I thinke wyll shewe no lesse. Dan Bartholmew his first Triumphe. Resigne king Priams sonnes, that princes were in Troy, Resigne to me your happy dayes, and boast no more of joy: Syr Paris first stand forth make aunswere for thy pheare, And if thou canst defend hir cause, whome Troy did bye so deare: What? blush not man, be bold, although thou beare some blame, Tell truth at last, and so be sure to save thy selfe from shame. Then gentle Sheapheard say: what madnesse dyd thee move, To choose of all the flowers in Greece, foule Helene for thy love? Needs must I coumpt hir foule, whose first frutes were forlorne, Although she solde hir seconde chaffe, above the price of corne. Alas, shee made of thee, a noddye for the nonce, For Menelaus lost hir twise, though thou hir foundst but once. But yet if in thine eye, shee seemde a peerelesse peece, Aske Theseus y? mighty Duke, what towns she knew in Greece? Aske him what made hir leave hir wofull aged sire, And steale to Athens gyglot like: what? what but foule desire? Alas poore Paris thou didst nothing else but gleane, The partched eares which he cast by, when he had reaped cleane: He slivde the gentle slippe, which could both twist and twind, And growing left the broken braunch, for th? that came behind, Yet hast thou fild the world with brute, (the more thy blame,) And sayest, that Hellens bewty past each other stately dame, For profe thou canst alledge the tast of ten years warre, And how hir blazing beames first brought both Greece &amp; Troy to jarre. No no, thou art deceivde, the drugs of foule despite, Did worke in Menelaus will, not losse of such delighte, Not love, but lothsome hate, not dolour, but disdain, Did make him selfe a sharpe rev?ge, til both his foes were slain, Thy brother Troylus eke, that gemme of gentle deedes, To thinke howe he abused was, alas my heart it bleedes: He bet about the bushe, whiles other caught the birds, Whome crafty Gresside mockt to muche, yet fede him still with words. And god he knoweth not I, who pluckt hir first sprong rose, Since Lollius and Chaucer both, make doubt upon that glose. But this I knowe to well, and he to farre it felte, How Diomede undid his knots, &amp; caught both brooch and belt, And how she chose to change, and how she changed still, And how she dyed leaper like, against hir lovers will. Content you then good knightes, your triumphe to resigne, Confesse your starres both dimme and darke, wheras my sunne doth shine: For this I dare avow, without vaunt be it told, My derling is more faire than she, for whome proud Troy was solde. More constant to conteyne, than Cresside to be coy, No Calcas can contrive the craft, to traine hir out of Troye, No Diomede can drawe hir setled harte to change, No madding moode can move hir mind, nor make hir thoughtes to range. For hir alone it is, that Cupide blindfolde goes, And dare not looke for feare least he his libertie should loose: At hir dame Venus chafes, and pines in jelowsie, Least bloudy Mars should hir espie, and chang his fantasie, Of hir the Quene of Heaven doth stand in dreadfull doubt, Least Jove should melte in drops of gold, if once he find hir out. Oh that my tonge had skill, to tell hir prayse aright, Or that my pen hir due desertes, in worthy verse could write: Or that my minde could muse, or happie heart conceive, Some words that might resound hir worth, by high Minervas leave. Oh how the blooming joyes, do blossome in my brest, To think within my secret thought, how far she steines y? rest. Me thinkes I heare hir speake, me thinkes I see hir still, Me thinkes I feele hir feelingly, me thinkes I know hir will. Me thinkes I see the states which sue to hir for grace, Me thinkes I see one looke of hirs repulse them all apace. Me thinkes that houre is yet, and evermore shall be, Wherein my happie happe was first, hir heavenly face to see: Wherein I spide the writte, which woond betweene hir eyne, And sayd behold, be bold, for I, am borne to be but thine. Me thinks I feele the joyes, which never yet were felt, Whome flame before yet never toucht, me thinks I feele them melt. One word &amp; there an end, me thinks she is the sunne, Which only shineth now a daies, she dead, y? world were done. The rest are twinkling starres, or Moones which borow light, To comfort other carefull soules, which wander in the night. And night God knowes it is, where other Ladies bee, For sure my dame adornes the day, there is no sunne but shee. Then lovers by your leave, and thinke it nothing strange, Although I seme with calme content, in seas of joyes to range: For why, my sailes have found both wind and waves at wyll, And depthes of all delightes in hir, with whome I travell styll. And ancors being wayed, I leave you all at large, To steare this seemelye Shippe my selfe, suche is my mistresse charge. Fato non fortuna. Dan Bartholmew his second Triumphe. Fye pleasure fye, thou cloyest me with delight, Thou fylst my mouth with sweete meates overmuch, I wallowe styll in joye both daye and night. I deeme, I dreame, I doe, I taste, I touch: No thing but all that smelles of perfect blisse, Fye pleasure fye, I cannot like of this. To taste (sometimes) a baite of bytter gall, To drinke a draught of sower Ale (some season) To eate browne bread with homely handes in Hall Doth much encrease mens appetites by reason: And makes the sweete more sugred that ensewes, Since mindes of men do styll seeke after newes. The pampred horse is seldome seene in breath, Whose maunger makes his greace (oftimes) to melt, The crammed Fowle comes quickly to his death. Such coldes they catche in hottest happes that swelt. And I (much like) in pleasure scawled styll, Doe feare to starve although I feede my fill. It might suffice that love hath built his bowre, Betwene my Ladies lively shyning eyes, It were inough that Bewties fading flowre: Growes ever freshe with hir in heavenly wise. It had bene well that shee were faire of face, And yet not robbe all other Dames of grace. To muse in minde, how wise, how faire, how good, How brave, howe franke, how curteous, and how true, My Lad[y] is: doth but inflame my blood, With humors such, as byd my health adue. Since happe alwaies when it is clombe on hye, Doth fall full lowe, though earst it reachte the Skye. Lo pleasure lo, lo thus I leade a life, That laughes for joye, and trembleth oft for dread, Thy panges are such as call for changes knife, To cut the twist, or else to stretch the thread, Which holdes yfeere the bondell of my blisse, Fye pleasure fye, I dare not trust to this. Fato non fortuna. Dan Bartholmewes his third Triumphe. Yf ever man yet found the bathe of perfect blisse, Then swimme I now amid the seas where nought but pleasure is. I love and am beloved, without vaunt be it tolde, Of one more faire then she of Greece, for whome proud Troy was solde. As bountifull and good as Cleopatra Queene, As constant as Penelope, unto her make was seene. What would you more? my penne, unable is to write, The least desert that seemes to shine within this worthy wight. So that (for nowe) I ceasse with handes helde up on hye. And crave of God that when I chaunge, I may be forst to dye. Fato non Fortuna. The Reporter. These vaunting verses with a many mo, (To his mishap) have come unto my handes, Whereof the rest (bicause he sayled so, In braggers boate which set it selfe on sandes, And brought him eke fast bound in follyes bands) Of curtesie I keepe them from your sight, Let these suffice which of my selfe I write. The highest tree that ever yet could growe, Although full fayre it florisht for a season, Founde yet at last some fall to bring it lowe, This olde sayd sawe is (God he knoweth) not geason: For when things passe the reach and bounds of reason, They fall at last, although they stand a time, And bruse the more, the higher that they clime. So Bartholmew unto his paine dyd prove, For when he thought his hap to be most hye, And that he onely reapt the fruictes of love, And that he swelt in all prosperitie, His comfort chaunged to calamitie: And though I doe him wrong to tell the same, Yet reade it you, and let me beare the blame. The Saint he serv'd became a craftie devill, His goddesse to an Idoll seemde to chaunge, Thus all his good transformed into evill, And every joy to raging griefe dyd raunge: Which Metamorphosis was marvels straunge: Yet shall you seldome otherwise it prove, Where wicked Lust doth beare the name of Love. This sodaine chaunge when he began to spye, And colde suspect into his minde had crept, He bounst and bet his head tormentingly, And from all company him selfe he kept, Wherby so farre in stormes of strife he stept, That nowe he seemed an Image not a man, His eyes so dead, his colour waxt so wan. And I which alwayes beare him great good wyll, (Although I knew the cause of all his griefe, And what had trainde and tysed him theretyll, And plaine to speake, what moved his mischiefe) Yet since I sought to ease him with reliefe: I dyd become importunate to knowe, The secreete cause whereon this grudge should growe. At last with much ado, his trembling tonge, Bewrayde theffect of his unwylling wyll, Which here to tell since it were all to longe, And I therewith too barren am of skyll, And trouble you with tedious tydinges styll, Content you now to heare himselfe rehearse, His strange affectes in his lamenting verse. Which verse he wrote at Bathe (as earst was sayd) And there I sawe him when he wrote the same, I sawe him there with many moanes dismaide, I sawe him there both fryse and flashe in flame, I sawe him greev'd when others made good game: And so appeareth by his darke discourse, The which to reade I crave your just remorse. Dan Bartholmewes Dolorous discourses. I have entreated care to cut the thread, Which all to long hath held my lingring life, And here aloofe nowe have I hyd my head, From company thereby to stint my strife. This solitarye place doth please me best, Where I may weare my wylling mind with moane, And where the sighes which boyle out of my brest, May skald my heart, and yet the cause unknowne. All this I doe, for thee my sweetest sowre, For whome (of yore) I counted not of care, For whome with hungrie jawes I dyd devoure The secrete baite which lurked in the snare: For whome I thought all forreine pleasures paine, For whome againe, all paine dyd pleasure seeme, But onely thine, I found all fansies vaine, But onely thine, I dyd no dolours deeme. Such was the rage, that whilome dyd possesse, The privie corners of my mazed mind: When hote desire, dyd compt those tormentes lesse Which gaind the gaze that dyd my freedome bind. And now (with care) I can record those dayes, And call to mind the quiet lyfe I led, Before I first beheld thy golden rayes, When thine untrueth yet troubled not my hed. Remember thou, as I can not forget, Howe I had layde, both love, and lust aside, And howe I had my fixed fancie set, In constant vowe, for ever to abide. The bitter proofe of panges in pleasure past, The costlye tast, of hony mixt with gall: The painted heaven, which turnde to hell at last. The freedome fainde, which brought me but to thrall. The lingring sute, well fed with freshe delayes, The wasted vowes which fled with every winde: The restlesse nightes, to purchase pleasing dayes, The toyling daies to please my restlesse minde. All these (with mo) had brused so my brest, And graft such grefe within my groning heart, That had I left Dame fansie and the rest, To greener yeeres, which might endure the smart. My wearie bones did beare away the skarres, Of many a wound received by disdaine: So that I found the fruite of all those warres, To be naught else but panges of unknowen paine. And nowe mine eyes were shut from such delight, My fansie faint, my hote desires were colde, When cruell hap, presented to my sight The maydens face, in yeeres which were not olde. I thinke the Goddesse of revenge devisde, So to bee wreackt on my rebelling wyll, Bicause I had in youthfull yeeres dispisde, To taste the baites, which tyste my fansie styll. Howe so it were, God knowes, I cannot tell: But if I lye, you Heavens, the plague be mine, I sawe no sooner, how delight dyd dwell Betweene those litle infantes eyes of thine, But straight a sparkling cole of quicke desire, Dyd kindle flame within my frozen heart, And yelding fansie softly blewe the fire, Which since hath bene the cause of all my smart. What neede I say? thy selfe for me can sweare, Howe much I tendred thee in tender yeares: Thy life was then to me (God knowes) full deare, My life to thee is light, as nowe appeares. I loved the first, and shall do to my last, Thou flattredst first, and so thou wouldst do styll: For love of thee full many paines I past, For deadly hate thou seekest me to kyll. I cannot nowe, with manly tongue rehearse, How sone that melting mind of thine dyd yelde, I shame to write, in this waymenting verse, With howe small fight, I vanquisht thee in fielde: But Cæsar he, which all the world subdude, Was never yet so proude of Victorye, Nor Hanyball, with martiall feates endude, Dyd so much please himselfe in pollicie, As I (poore I) dyd seeme to triumphe then, When first I got the Bulwarkes of thy brest, With hote Alarmes I comforted my men, In formost ranke I stoode before the rest, And shooke my flagge, not all to shewe my force, But that thou mightst thereby perceive my minde: Askaunces As who should say: lo, nowe coulde I kyll thy corce, And yet my life is unto thee resinde. Well let this passe, and thinke uppon the joye, The mutuall love, the confidence, the trust, Whereby we both abandoned annoye, And fed our mindes with fruites of lovely lust. Thinke on the Tythe, of kysses got by stealth, Of sweete embracinges shortened by feare. Remember that which did maintaine our helth, Alas alas why shoulde I name it here. And in the midst of all those happie dayes, Do not forget the chaunges of my chaunce, When in the depth of many waywarde wayes, I onely sought, what might thy state advaunce. Thou must confesse how much I carde for thee, When of my selfe, I carde not for my selfe, And when my hap was in mishappes to be, Esteemd thee more, than al the worldly pelfe. Mine absente thoughtes did beate on thee alone, When thou hadst found a fond and newfound choice: For lacke of thee I sunke in endlesse mone, When thou in chaunge didst tumble and rejoyce. O mighty goddes needes must I honor you, Needes must I judge your judgmentes to be just, Bicause she did for sake him that was true, And with false love, did cloke a fained luste. By high decrees, you ordayned the chaunge, To light on such, as she must needes mislike, A meete rewarde for such as like to raunge, When fansies force, their feeble fleshe doth strike. But did I then give brydle to thy fall, Thou head strong thou accuse me if thou can? Did I not hazard love yea life and all, To warde thy will, from that unworthy man? And when by toyle I travayled to finde, The secrete causes of thy madding moode, I found naught else but tricks of Cressides kinde, Which playnly provde, that thou weart of hir bloud. I found that absent Troylus was forgot, When Dyomede had got both brooch and belt, Both glove and hand, yea harte and all god wot, When absent Troylus did in sorowes swelt. These tricks (with mo) thou knowst thy self I found, Which nowe are needelesse here for to reherse, Unlesse it were to touche a tender wound, With corosives my panting heart to perse. But as the Hounde is counted little worth, Which giveth over for a losse or twaine, And cannot find the meanes to single forth The stricken Deare which doth in heard remaine: Or as the kindly Spaniell which hath sprong The prety Partriche, for the Falcons flight, Doth never spare but thrusts the thornes among, To bring this byrd yet once againe to sight, And though he knowe by proofe (yea dearely bought) That selde or never, for his owne availe, This wearie worke of his in vaine is wrought, Yet spares he not but labors tooth and nayle. So labord I to save thy wandring shippe, Which reckelesse then, was running on the rockes, And though I saw thee seeme to hang the lyppe, And set my great good wyll, as light as flockes: Yet hauld I in, the mayne sheate of the minde, And stayed thy course by ancors of advice, I woon thy wyll into a better winde, To save thy ware, which was of precious price. And when I had so harbored thy Barke, In happy haven, which saufer was than Dover, The Admyrall, which knewe it by the marke, Streight challengde all, and sayd thou wert a rover. Then was I forst in thy behalfe to pleade, Yea so I dyd, the Judge can saye no lesse, And whiles in toyle, this lothsome life I leade, Camest thou thy selfe the faulte for to confesse, And downe on knee before thy cruell foe, Dydst pardon crave, accusing me for all, And saydst I was the cause, that thou didst so, And that I spoone the thred of all thy thrall. These thinges are mistical and not to bee understoode but by Thaucthour him selfe.Not so content, thou furthermore didst sweare That of thy selfe thou never ment to swerve, For proofe wherof thou didst the colours weare, Which might bewray, what saint thou ment to serve. And that thy blood was sacrificed eke, To manyfest thy stedfast martyrd mynde, Till I perforce, constraynd thee for to seeke, These raging seas, adventures there to finde. Alas, alas, and out alas for me, Who am enforced, thus for to repeate The false reports and cloked guyles of thee, Whereon (to oft) my restlesse thoughts do beate. But thus it was, and thus God knowes it is. Which when I founde by playne and perfect proofe, My musing minde then thought it not amisse, To shrinke aside, lamenting all aloofe, And so to beate my simple shiftlesse brayne, For some device, that might redeeme thy state. Lo here the cause, for why I take this payne, Lo how I love the wight which me doth hate: Lo thus I lye, and restlesse rest in Bathe, Whereas I bathe not now in blisse pardie, But boyle in Bale and skamble thus in skathe, Bycause I thinke on thine unconstancie. And wylt thou knowe howe here I spend my time, And howe I drawe my dayes in dolours styll? Then staye a while: give eare unto my rime, So shalt thou know the weight of all my wyll. When Titan is constrained to forsake, His Lemans couche, and clymeth to his carte, Then I begin to languishe for thy sake, And with a sighe, which maye bewray my smarte, I cleare mine eyes whome gumme of teares had glewed, And up on foote I set my ghostly corse, And when the stony walles have oft renewed My pittious plaintes, with Ecchoes of remorce, Then doe I crye and call upon thy name, And thus I saye, thou curst and cruell bothe, Beholde the man, which taketh griefe for game, And loveth them, which most his name doe lothe. Behold the man which ever truely ment, And yet accusde as aucthour of thine yll, Behold the man, which all his life hath spent To serve thy selfe, and aye to worke thy wyll: Behold the man, which onely for thy love, Dyd love himselfe, whome else he set but light: Behold the man, whose blood (for thy behove) Was ever prest to shed it selfe outright. And canst thou nowe condemne his loyaltie? And canst thou craft to flatter such a friend? And canst thou see him sincke in jeoperdie? And canst thou seeke to bring his life to ende? Is this the right reward for such desart? Is this the fruite of seede so timely sowne? Is this the price, appointed for his part? Shall trueth be thus by treason overthrowne? Then farewell faith, thou art no womans pheare: And with that word I staye my tongue in time, With rolling eyes I loke about eache where, Least any man should heare my raving rime. And all in rage, enraged as I am, I take my sheete, my slippers and my Gowne, And in the Bathe from whence but late I came, I cast my selfe in dollours there to drowne. There all alone I can my selfe conveye, Into some corner where I sit unseene, And to my selfe (there naked) can I saye, Behold these braunefalne armes which once have bene Both large and lustie, able for to fight, Nowe are they weake, and wearishe God he knowes Unable now to daunt the fowle despight, Which is presented by my cruel foes. My thighes are thin, my body lanck and leane, It hath no bumbast now, but skin and bones: And on mine Elbowe as I lye and leane, Another misterie.I see a trustie token for the nones. I spie a bracelet bounde about mine arme, Which to my shaddowe seemeth thus to saye, Beleeve not me: for I was but a Charme, To make thee sleepe, when others went to playe. And as I gaze thus galded all with griefe, I finde it fazed almost quite in sunder, Then thinke I thus: thus wasteth my reliefe, And though I fade, yet to the world, no wonder. For as this lace, by leysure learnes to weare, So must I faint, even as the Candle wasteth, These thoughts (deere sweet) within my brest I beare, And to my long home, thus my life it hasteth. Herewith I [f]eele the droppes of sweltring sweate, Which trickle downe my face, enforced so, And in my body feele I lykewise beate, A burning heart which tosseth too and fro. Thus all in flames I sinderlyke consume, And were it not that wanhope lendes me wynde, Soone might I fret my fa[n]cyes all in fume, And lyke a Ghost my ghost his grave might finde. But frysing hope doth blowe ful in my face, And colde of cares becommes my cordiall, So that I styl endure that yrksome place, Where sorrowe seethes to skalde my skinne withal. And when from thence or company me dri[ve]s, Or weary woes do make me change my seate, Then in my bed my restlesse paines revives, Until my fellowes call me downe to meate. And when I ryse, my corpse for to araye, I take the glasse, sometimes (but not for pride, For God he knowes my minde is not so gaye) But for I would in comelynesse abyde: I take the glasse, wherein I seeme to see, Such wythred wrinckles and so fowle disgrace, That lytle marvaile seemeth it to mee, Another misterie. Though thou so well dydst like the noble face. The noble face was faire and freshe of hewe, My wrinckled face is fowle and fadeth fast: The noble face was unto thee but newe, My wrinckled face is olde and cleane outcast: The noble face might move thee with delight, My wrinckled face could never please thine eye: Loe thus of crime I covet thee to quite. And styll accuse my selfe of Surcuydry: As one that am unworthy to enjoye, The lasting fruite of suche a love as thine, Thus am I tickled styll with every toye, And when my Fellowes call me downe to dyne, No chaunge of meate provokes mine appetite, Nor sauce can serve to taste my meates withall, Then I devise the juyce of grapes to dight, For Sugar and for Sinamon I call, For Ginger, Graines, and for eche other spice, Wherewith I mixe the noble Wine apace, My Fellowes prayse the depth of my devise, And saye it is as good as Ippocrace. As Ippocrace saye I? and then I swelt, Another misterie. My faynting lymmes straight fall into a sowne, Before the taste of Ippocrace is felt, The naked name in dollours doth mee drowne, For then I call unto my troubled mynde, That Ippocrace hath bene thy daylye drinke, That Ippocrace hath walkt with everye winde. In bottels that were fylled to the brinke, With Ippocrace thou banquetedst full ofte, With Ippocrace thou madst thy selfe full merrye, Such cheere had set thy new love so alofte, That olde love nowe was scarcely worth a cherry. And then againe I fall into a traunce, But when my breth returnes against my wyll, Before my tongue can tell my wofull chaunce, I heare my fellowes how they whisper still. One sayth that Ippocrace is contrary, Unto my nature and complexion, Whereby they judge that all my malladye, Was long of that by alteration. An other sayth, no, no this man is weake, And for such weake, so hote thinges are not best, Then at the last I heare no lyar speake, But one which knowes the cause of mine unrest, And sayth, this man is (for my life) in love, He hath received repulse, or dronke disdaine. Alas crye I: and ere I can remove, Into a sowne I sone returne againe. Thus drive I foorth, my doolefull dining time, And trouble others with my troubles styll, But when I here, the Bell hath passed prime, Into the Bathe I wallowe by my wyll, That there my teares (unsene) might ease my griefe, For though I starve yet have I fed my fill, In privie panges I count my best relife. And still I strive in weary woes to drench, But when I plondge, than woe is at an ebbe, My glowing coles are all to quicke to quenche. And I (to warme) am wrapped in the webbe, Which makes me swim against the wished wave, Lo thus (deare wenche) I leade a lothsome life, And greedely I seeke the greedy grave, To make an ende of all these stormes and strife, But death is deafe, and heares not my desire, So that my dayes continewe styl in dole, And in my nightes I feele the secrete fire, Which close in embers, coucheth lyke a cole, And in the daye hath bene but raked up, With covering ashes of my company, Now breakes it out, and boyles the careful cuppe, Which in my heart doth hang full heavily. I melt in teares, I swelt in chilling sweat, My swelling heart, breakes with delay of paine, I freeze in hope, yet burne in haste of heate, I wishe for death, and yet in life remaine. And when dead sleepe doth close my dazeled eyes, Then dreadful dreames my dolors do encrease. Me thinkes I lie awake in wofull wise, And see thee come, my sorrowes for to cease. Me seemes thou saist (my good) what meaneth this? What ayles thee thus to languish and lament? How can it be that bathing all in blisse: Such cause unknowne disquiets thy content? Thou doest me wrong to keepe so close from me The grudge or griefe, which gripeth now thy heart, For well thou knowest, I must thy partner be In bale, in blisse, in solace, and in smarte. Alas, alas, these things I deeme in dreames, But when mine eyes are open and awake, I see not thee: where with the flowing streames, Of brinishe teares their wonted floods do make. Thus as thou seest I spend both nightes and dayes, And for I find the world did judge me once, A witlesse wryter of these lovers layes, I take my pen and paper for the nonce, I laye aside this foolishe ryding rime, And as my troubled head can bring to passe, I thus bewray the torments of my time: Beare with my Muse, it is not as it was. Fato non fortuna. The extremitie of his Passion. Among the toyes which tosse my braine, and reave my mind from quiet rest, This one I finde, doth there remaine, to breede debate within my brest. When wo would work, to wound my wyl, I cannot weepe, nor waile my fyll. My tongue hath not the skill to tell, the smallest griefe which gripes my heart, Mine eyes have not the power to swell, into such Seas of secrete smart, That will might melt to waves of woe, and I might swelt in sorrowes so. Yet shed mine eyes no trickling teares, but flouddes which flowe abundauntly, Whose fountaine first enforst by feares, found out the gappe of jelousie. And by that breache, it soketh so, that all my face, is styll on flowe. My voice is like the raging wind, which roareth still, and never staies, The thoughtes which tomble in my minde, are like the wheele which whirles alwayes, Nowe here, nowe there, nowe up, now downe, in depth of waves, yet cannot drowne. The sighes which boyle out of my brest, are not lyke those, which others use, For lovers sighes, sometimes take rest, and lend their mindes, a leave to muse. But mine are like the surging Seas, whome calme nor quiet can appeas. And yet they be but sorrowes smoke, my brest the fordge where furie playes, My panting heart, yt strikes the stroke, my fancie blowes the flame alwaies, The coles are kindled by desire, and Cupide warmes him by the fire. Thus can I neyther drowne in dole, nor burne to ashes though I waste, Mine eyes can neyther quenche the cole, which warmes my heart in all this haste. Nor yet my fancie make such flame, that I may smoulder in the same. Wherefore I come to seeke out Care, beseeching him of curtesie, To cut the thread which cannot weare, by panges of such perplexitie. And but he graunt this boone of mine, thus must I live and ever pine. Fato non fortuna. [Lo thus (deere heart) I force my frantike Muse] Lo thus (deere heart) I force my frantike Muse, To frame a verse in spite of my despight, But whiles I doo these mirthlesse meeters use, This rashe conceite doth reve me from delight. I call to minde howe many loving layes, Howe many Sonets, and how many songes, I dyd devise within those happie dayes, When yet my wyl, had not received wronges. All which were evermore regarded so, That litle fruite I seemd thereby to reape, But rather when I had bewrayed my woe, Thy love was light, and lusted styll to leape. The rimes which pleased thee were all in print, And mine were ragged, hard for to be read, Another misterie. Lo deere: this dagger dubbes me with this dint, And leave this wound within my jelous head. But since I have confessed unto Care, That now I stand uppon his curtesie, And that the bale, which in my brest I bare, Hath not the skill to kyll me cunningly, Therefore with all my whole devotion, To Care I make this supplication. Fato non fortuna. His libell of request exhibited to Care. O curteous Care, whome others (cruell) call, And raile upon thine honourable name, O knife that canst cut of the thread of thrall, O sheare that shreadst the seemerent sheete of shame, O happye ende of every greevous game: Vouchsafe O Prince, thy vassall to behold, Who loves thee more, than can with tongue be told. And nowe vouchsafe to pittie this his plaint, Whose teares bewray, His truth alway, Although his feeble tongue be forst to faint. I must confesse O noble king to thee, That I have beene a Rebell in my youth, I preast alwaies in pleasures court to bee, I fled from that, which Cupide still eschuth, I fled from Care, lo now I tell the truth, And in delightes, I loved so to dwell, Thy heavenly house dyd seeme to me but hell. Such was my rage, the which I now repent, And pardon crave, My soule to save, Before the webbe of weary life be spent. But marke what fruites dyd grow on such a tree, What crop dyd rise upon so rashe sowne seede, For when I thought my selfe in heaven to bee, In depth of hell I drowned was in deede: Whereon to thinke my heavie hart doth bleede: Me thought I swumme in Seas of all delight, When as I sunke in puddles of despight, Alas alas I thought my selfe belov'd, When deadly hate, Did play checke mate, With me poore pawne, that no such prancks had prov'd. This when I tryed (ay me) to be to true, I wept for woe, I pined all for paine, I tare my heere, I often chaunged hewe, I left delight, with dollours to complaine. I shund each place where pleasure dyd remaine, I cride, I calde on every kinde of death, I strove eache way to stop my fainting breath. Short tale to make, I stept so farre in strife, That still I sought, With all my thought, Some happie helpe to leave my lothed life. But hope was he that held my hande abacke, From quicke dispatch of all my griping griefe, Hope is ever a contrary to a lovers Passion. When heate of hate had burnt my will to wracke, Then hope was colde, and lent my life reliefe, In every choice hope challengde to be chiefe. When coldest crampes had cleane orecome my heart, Then hope was hote, and warnde my weary smart, [W]hen heart was heardie, hope was still in dread, When heart was faint, (With feares attaint,) Then hardie hope held up my fearefull head. Thus when I found that neither flowing teares, Could drowne my heart in waves of wery wo, Nor hardy hand could overcome my feares, To cut the sacke of all my sorrowes so, Nor death would come, nor I to death could go. And yet I felt great droppes of secrete smart, Distilling styll within my dying heart: I then perceivde that onely care was he, Which as my friend, Might make an end, Of all these paines, and set my fansie free. Wherefore (oh Care) graunt thou my just request, Oh kyll my corpse, oh quickly kyll me nowe. Oh make an ende and bring my bones to rest, Oh cut my thread (good Care) I care not howe, Oh Care be kinde: and here I make a vowe, That when my life out of my brest shall part, I wyll present thee with my faithfull hart: And send it to thee as a Sacrifice, Bicause thou hast, Vouchsaft at last, To ende my furies in this friendly wise. Fato non Fortuna. [What greater glory can a Keysar gaine] What greater glory can a Keysar gaine, If madde moode move his subjectes to rebell, Than that at last (when all the traytours traine, Have trode the pathe, of deepe repentaunce well, And naked neede with Cold and Hunger both, Hath bitten them abrode in forren land, Whereby they may their lewde devises loth. When hairbraind haste, with cold advise is scande) If then at last, they come upon their knee, And pardon crave with due submission: And for this cause, I thinke that Care of me, Was moved most, to take compassion. For now I find, that pittie prickes his mind, To see me plonged still in endlesse paine, And right remorse, his princely heart doth bind, To rule the rage wherein I do remaine. I feele my teares doe now begin to stay, For Care from them their swelling springs doth soke, I feele my sighes their labours now allaye, For Care hath quencht the coles that made th? smoke. I feele my panting heart begins to rest, For Care hath staide the hammers of my head, I feele the flame which blazed in my brest, Is nowe with carefull ashes overspread. And gentle Care, hath whet his karving knife, To cut in twaine the thread of all my thrall, Desired death nowe overcommeth life, And wo still workes to helpe in haste with all. But since I feele these panges approching so, And lothed life begin to take his leave, Me thinkes it meete, to give before I go, Such landes and goodes, as I behind me leave. So to discharge my troubled conscience, And eke to set an order for my heyre, Who might (perhaps) be put to great expence, To sue for that, which I bequeath him here. Wherefore (deere wenche) with all my full intent, I thus begin to make my Testament. Fato non fortuna. His last wyll and Testament. In Jove his mighty name, this eight and twentith day, Of frosted bearded Januar, the enemy to May: Since Adam was create, five thousand yeeres I gesse, Five hundreth, forty more and five, as stories do expresse. I being whole of minde, (immortall Gods have praise) Though in my body languishing with panges of paine alwayes, Do thus ordaine my wyll which long in woes have wepte, Beseeching mine executours to see it duely kept. Fyrst I bequeath my soule on Charons boate to tende, Untill thy life (my love) at last may light on luckye ende, That there it may awaite, to wayte upon thy ghost, Wh? thou hast quite &amp; clene forgot what pranks now please thee most. So shall it well be seene whose love is like to mine: For so I meane to trye my truth, and there tyll then to pine. My body be enbalmde, and cloased up in chest, With oyntments and with spiceries of every sweete the best: And so preserved styll untill the day do come, That death divorce my love from life, &amp; trusse hir up in tombe. Then I bequeath my corps to couche beneathe hir bones, And there to feede the greedy wormes that linger for the nones. To frette uppon her fleshe, which is to fine therefore, This service may it doe hir yet, although it do no more. My heart (as heretofore) I must bequeathe to Care, And God he knowes, I thinke the gift to simple for his share. But that he may perceive, I meane to pay my dew, I will it shall be taken quicke, and borne him bleeding new, As for my funerals, I leave that toye at large, To be as mine executours wyll give thereto in charge. Yet if my goodes will stretche unto my strange device, Then let this order be observ'd, mine heyre shall pay the price: First let the torche bearers be wrapte in weedes of woe, Let all their lightes be virgin waxe, because I lov'de it so. And care not though the twist be course that lends them light, If fansie fume, &amp; freewil flame, then must they needs burn bright. Next them let come the quier, with psalmes and dolefull song, Recording all my rough repulse and wraying all my wrong. And when the deskant singes, in treeble tunes above, Then let fa burden say, (by lowe) I liv'd and dyde for love: About my heavy hearse, some mourners would I have, Who migh[t] the same accompany and stand about the grave, But let them be such men, as maye confesse with me, How contrary the lots of love, to all true lovers bee. Let Patience be the Priest, the Clarke be Close conceipt, The Sextin be Simplicitie, which meaneth no disceipt. Let almes of Love be delt, even at the Chaunsell doore, And feede them there with freshe delayes, as I have bene of yore: Then let the yongest sort, be set to ring Loves Bels, And pay Repentance for their paines, but give th? nothing else, Thus when the Dirge is done, let every man depart, And learne by me what harme it is to have a faithfull hart. Those litle landes I have, mine heyre must needes possesse, His name is Lust, the landes be losse, few lovers scape with lesse. The rest of all my goodes, which I not here rehearse, Give learned Poets for their paines, to decke my Tombe with verse: And let them write these wordes upon my carefull chest, Lo here he lies, that was as true (in love) as is the best. Alas I had forgot the Parsons dewe to paye, And so my soule in Purgatorye, might remaine alway. Then for my privie Tythes, as kysses caught by stealth, Sweete collinges &amp; such other knackes as multiplied my wealth: I give the Vickar here, to please his greedie wyll, A deintie dishe of suger soppes, but saust with sorrow stil: And twise a weeke at least, let dight them for his dishe, On Fridayes and on wednesdaies, to save expence of fishe. Nowe have I much bequeathed and litle left behinde, And others mo must yet be served or else I were unkinde. Wet eyes and wayling wordes, Executours I make, And for their paines ten pound of teares let either of them take. Let sorrow at the last my Supravisor be, And stedfastnesse my surest steade, I give him for his fee. Yet in his pattent place this Sentence of proviso, That he which loveth stedfastly, shall want no sauce of sorrow. Thus now I make an ende, of this my wearie wyll, And signe it with my simple hand, and set my seale there tyll. And you which reade my wordes, although they be in rime, Yet reason may perswade you eke, Thus lovers dote sometime. The Subscription and seale. My mansion house was Mone: from Dolours dale I came, I Fato: Non Fortuna, hight, lo now you know my name: My seale is sorrowes sythe, within a fielde of flame, Which cuts in twaine a carefull heart, y? sweltreth in the same. Fato non Fortuna. [Alas, lo now I heare the passing Bell] Alas, lo now I heare the passing Bell, Which Care appointeth carefullye to knoule, And in my brest, I feele my heart now swell, To breake the stringes which joynde it to my soule. The Crystall yse, which lent mine eyes their light, Doth now waxe dym, and dazeled all with dread, My senses all, wyll now forsake me quite, And hope of health abandoneth my head, My wearie tongue can talke no longer now, My trembling hand nowe leaves my penne to hold, My joynts nowe stretch, my body cannot bowe, My skinne lookes pale, my blood now waxeth cold. And are not these, the very panges of death? Yes sure (sweete heart) I know them so to bee, They be the panges, which strive to stop my breath, They be the panges, which part my love from thee. What sayd I? Love? Nay life: but not my love, My life departes, my love continues styll: My lothed lyfe may from my corpse remove, My loving Love shall alwayes worke thy wyll. It was thy wyll even thus to trye my truth, Thou hast thy wyll, my truth may now be sene, It was thy wyll, that I should dye in youth, Thou hast thy wyll my yeares are yet but grene. Thy penaunce was that I should pine in paine, I have performde thy penaunce all in wo, Thy pleasure was that I should here remaine, I have bene glad to please thy fansie so. Nowe since I have performed every part Of thy commaunde: as neare as tongue can tell, Content thee yet before my muse depart, To take this Sonet for my last farewell. Fato non fortuna. His Farewell. Farewell deere Love whome I have loved and shall, Both in this world, and in the world to come, For proofe whereof my sprite is Charons thrall, And yet my corpse attendant on thy toome. Farewell deere sweete, whose wanton wyll to please Eche taste of trouble seemed mell to me, Farewell sweete deare, whose doubtes for to appease, I was contented thus in bale to be. Farewell my lyfe, farewell for and my death, For thee I lyv'd for thee nowe must I dye, Farewell from Bathe, whereas I feele my breath Forsake my breast in great perplexitie, Alas how welcome were this death of mine, If I had dyde betweene those armes of thine? Fato non Fortuna. The Reporters conclusion. Where might I now find flooddes of flowing teares, So to suffice the swelling of mine eyes? How might my breast unlode the bale it beares? Alas alas how might my tongue devise To tell this weary tale in wofull wise? To tell I saye these tydinges nowe of truth, Which may provoke the craggy rockes to ruth? In depth of dole would God that I were drownde, Where flattering joyes might never find me out, Or graved so within the greedy grounde, As false delights might never breede my doubt, Nor guilefull love hir purpose bring about: Whose trustlesse traines in collours for to paint, I find by proofe my wittes are all to faint. I was that man whome destinies ordeine, To beare eche griefe that groweth on the mold, I was that man which proved to my paine, More panges at once than can with tongue be told, I was that man (hereof you maye be bold) Whome heaven and earth did frame to scoffe and scorne, I, I was he which to that ende was borne. Suffized not my selfe to taste the fruite, Of sugred sowres which growe in gadding yeares, But that I must with paine of lyke pursute, Perceive such panges by paterne of my peares, And feele how fansies fume could fond my pheares? Alas I find all fates against me bent, For nothing else I lyve but to lament. The force of friendship bound by holy othe, Dyd drawe my wyll into these croked wayes, For with my frend I went to Bathe (though loth) To lend some comfort in his dollie dayes, The stedfast friend stickes fast at all assayes: Yet was I loth such time to spend in vaine, The cause whereof, lo here I tell you playne. By proofe I found as you may well perceive, That all good counsell was but worne in wast, Such painted paines his passions did deceive, That bitter gall was mell to him in tast, Within his will such rootes of ruine plast, As graffes of griefes were only given to growe, Where youth did plant and rash conceite did sowe. I sawe at first his eares were open aye To every tale which fed him with some hope, As fast againe I sawe him turne away From grave advise, which might his conscience grope, From reasons rule his fancie lightly lope, He only gave his mind to get that gaine, Which most he wisht and least could yet attaine. Not I alone, but many mo with me, Had found what ficklenesse his Idoll used, And how she claimed Cressides heire to be, And how she had his great good will abused, And how she was of many men refused, Who tride hir tricks and knew hir by the kinde, Save only him she made no lover blinde. But what for this? whose face is plainer seene, Than he which thinkes he walketh in a net? Or who in bale hath ever deeper beene, Than he which thought his state might not be bet? In such a jollitye these lovers jet, That weale to them doeth seeme to bee but wo, And griefe seemes joye, they feede theyr fancyes so. Tell him that reason ought to be his rule, And he allowed no reason but his owne, Tell him that best were quicklye to recule, Before all force by feares were overthrowne, And that his bale were better overblowne, Then thus to pine remedylesse in griefe, And he would saye that griefe was his reliefe. Short tale to make so long he lyved thus, Tyll at the last he gan in deede to dye, Beleeve me Lordes (and by him that dyed for us) I sawe him give to close his dying eye, I sawe him stryve and strangle passingly. And suche a griefe I tooke, that yet I not, If he or I had then more griefe ygot. But who hath seene a Lampe begyn to fade, Which lacketh oyle to feede his lyngring lyght, And then againe who so hath seene it made, With oyle and weecke to last the longsome night. Let him conceyve that I sawe such a sight. Whereof to thinke (although I sighde erewhile) Loe nowe I laughe my sorrowes to beguile. Upon the stones a trampling steede we heard, Which came ful straight unto our lodging doore, And straight therwith we heard how one enquirde, If such a Knight (as I describde before) Were lodged there: the Hoast withouten more, Sayd yes forsooth, and God he knowes (quod he) He is as sicke as any man maye bee. The messenger sware by no bugges I trowe, But bad our hoast to bring him where he laye, (Quod I to Bartholmew) I heare by lowe, A voice which seemes somewhat of you to saye: And eare that past not full a furlong waye, Behold the man came stowping in at doore, And truth to tell he syked wondrous sore. At last from out his bosome dyd he take, A Letter sealde yfolded fayre and well, And kyssing it (I thinke for Mistresse sake) He sayd to Bartholmew: Syr Knight be well, Nowe reade these lines the which I neede not tell, From whence they come: but make an ende of mone, For you are sicke, and she is woe begone. The theefe condemnde and gone to gallowe tree, (If one crye Grace: lo here a Pardon prest) Doth dye sometimes, when most he seemde to be, From death redeemd, such bronts may breede in brest, Twyxt sodaine joye, and thoughts which paine opprest, The Romaine Widdowe dyed when she beheld, Hir Sunne (whome earst She compted slaine in field). So Bartholmew tweene griefe and sodaine joye, Laye styll in traunce, me thinkes I see him yet, And out of doubte it gave me such anoye, To see him so, him selfe in fancies fret, That sure I thought his eyes in head were set. And that he laye (as some saye) drawing on, Untill his breath and all were past and gone. But high de[c]rees of heaven which had ordainde, (For his decaye) a freshe delaye of paine, Revived him: yet from his eyes downe raind, Such rewfull teares as moved me to plaine, The dolefull plight wherein he dyd remaine. For trust me now, to see him sorrowe so, It might have made a stone to melt in wo. Thrise dyd his tongue beginne to tell his thought, And thrise (alas) it foltred in his mouth, With stopping sobbes and skalding sighes he sought To utter that which was to me uncouth. So staies the streame, when furiouslie it flouth. And filles the dikes where it had wont to swimme, Untill by force it breakes above the brimme. At last (with paine) the first word that he spake, Was this: Alas, and therewithall he stayed, His feebled Jawes and hollowe voyce could make, None other sounde, his thoughtes were all dismayed, His hearye head full lowe in bosome layed. Yet when he sawe me marke what he would saye, He cryed right out Alas and welawaye. Alas (quod he) deare friend behold this bloode, And with that word he gan againe to sorrowne: The messenger which in a studdye stoode, Awakt at last: and in mine eare dyd rowne, Saying: those lines which I have there throwen downe. Were written all with blood of hir owne hande, For whome he nowe in this distresse doth stande. And since (quod he) She hath vouchsafed so, To shead hir blood in witnesse of hir griefe, Me thinkes he rather should relieve hir wo: Then thus deny to send hir some reliefe. Alas alas (quod he) she holdes him chiefe. And well wote I (what ere his fansie bee) There sittes no man so neere hir heart as hee. Therewith he raysde his heavy head alight, Askaunces Ha? in deede and thinkst thou so? But out alas his weake and weary sprit, Forbad his tongue in furder termes to go. His thought sayd Haight, his sillie speache cryed Ho. And thus he laye in dompes and dolefull trance, Tyll darksome night dyd somewhat change his chance. For when the light of day began to fade, And courtins round about his bed were drawne, A golden slomber dyd his lymmes invade, And held him husht tyll daye againe gan dawne, Whereby Dame quiet put him in a pawne, To set his thoughts (which strived earst) at one, And bad debate be packing to be gone. Percase sweete love dyd lull him so on sleepe, Perhaps Dame fansie rockt the Cradell too, How so it were I take thereof no keepe, With such conceiptes have I nothing to doo, But when he wakt he asked plainly who, Had brought him so from rage to quiet rest, And who had borne the torments from his brest? (Quod I) my friend: here is a letter lo, Behold it here and be all hole againe, What man were he that wyther would in wo, Which thus might prosper in despite of paine? Were he not worse then mad which would complaine, On such a friend as this to me doth seeme? Which (for thy health) hir blood doth not esteeme? Thus much I sayd to comfort him God knowes, (But what I thought that keepe I cloose in hold) Sometimes a man must flatter with his foes, And sometimes saye that brasse is bright as Gold: For he that hath not all thinges as he would, Must winke sometimes, as though he dyd not see, And seeme to thinke thinges are not as they bee. Dan Bartholmew gan take the briefe in hand, And brake the seale, but when he saw the blood, Good Lord how bolt upright his heere dyd stand? For though the friendly wordes therein were good, Yet many a thought they moved in his moode. As well appeared by his flecked cheekes, Nowe cherrye redde, nowe pale and greene as leekes. I dreamt (quod he) that I was done to death, And that I laye full colde in earth and claye, But that I was restored unto breath, By one that seemde lyke Pellycane to playe, Who shed his blood to give me foode alwaye, And made me live in spite of sorrowe styll, See how my dreame agrees now with this byll? His feebled wittes forgotten had there whyle, By whome and howe he had this letter first, But when he spyde the man, then gan he smile, For secreete joye his heart dyd seeme to burst, Now thought he best that (earst) he compted worst. And lovingly he dyd the man embrace, And askt howe farde the roote of all his grace? See sodaine chaunge, see subtile sweete disceipte, Behold how love can make his subjectes blinde, Let all men marke hereby what guilefull baite, Dan Cupide layeth to tyse the lovers minde: Alacke alacke a slender thread maye binde, That prysonor fast, which meanes to tarrye styll, A lytle road correctes a ready wyll. The briefe was writte and blotted all with gore, And thus it sayde: Behold howe stedfast love, Hath made me hardy (thankes have he therefore) To write these wordes thy doubtes for to remove, With mine owne blood: and yf for thy behove These bloody lynes do not thy Cares convert: I vowe the next shall bleede out of my heart. I dwell to long upon this thriftlesse tale, For Bartholmew was well appeasde hereby, And feelingly he banished his bale, Taking herein a tast of remedy, By lyte and lyte his fittes away gan flye. And in short space he dyd recover strength, To stand on foote and take his horse at length. So that we came to London both yfere, And there his Goddesse tarryed tyll we came, I am to blame to call hir Goddesse here, Since she deservde in deede no Goddesse name, But sure I thinke (and you may judge the same) She was [to] him a Goddesse in his thought, Although perhaps hir Shrines was overbought. I maye not write what words betweene them past, How teares of griefe were turnde to teares of joye, Nor how their dole became delight at last. Nor how they made great myrth of much anoye, Nor how content was coyned out of coye, But what I sawe and what I well maye write, That (as I maye) I meane for to endite. In lovely London love gan nowe renew, This blooddye Letter made it battle much, And all the doubtes which he in fansies drew, Were done away as there had bene none such, (But to him selfe) he bare no body grutch. Him selfe (he sayde) was cause of all this wo, Withouten cause that hir suspected so. O loving Youthes this glasse was made for you, And in the same you may your selves behold, Beleeve me nowe not one in all your crew, Which (where he loves) hath courage to be bold, Your Cressides climes are alwaies uncontrold. You dare not saye the Sunne is cleare and bright, You dare not sweare that darkesome is the night. Terence was wise which taught by Pamphilus, Howe courage quailes where love beblinds the sence, Though proofe of times makes lovers quarelous, Yet small excuse serves love for just defence. These Courtisanes have power by pretence To make a Swan of that which was a Crowe, As though blacke pitche were turned into Snowe. Ferenda, She whome heaven and earth had framde, For his decaye and to bewitche his wittes, Made him nowe thinke him selfe was to be blamde, Which causeles thus would fret himselfe in fittes, Shee made him thinke that sorrowe sildome sittes, Where trust is tyed in fast and faithfull knottes, She sayd Mistrust was meete for simple sottes. What wyl you more shee made him to beleeve, That she first loved although she yonger were, She made him thinke that his distresse dyd greeve, Hir guiltlesse minde: and (that it might appeare, Howe these conceiptes could joyne or hang yfere) She dyd confesse howe soone shee yeelded his, Such force (quod she) in learned men there is. She furder sayde that all to true it was, Howe youthfull yeares (and lacke of him alone) Had made hir once to choose out brittle glasse, For perfect Gold: She dyd confesse (with mone) That youthfully shee bytte a worthlesse bone. But that therein she tasted deepe delight, That sayde shee not, nor I presume to write. Shee sware (and that I beare full well in minde) Howe Dyomede had never Troylus place, Shee sayd and sware (how ever sate the winde) That Admirals dyd never know hir case, She sayd againe that never Noble Face, Dyd please hir eye nor moved hir to change, She sayd her minde was never geven to range. She sayd and sayd that Bracelettes were ybound, To hold him fast (but not to charme his thought) She wysht therewith that she were deepely drownd, In Ippocrace: if ever she had sought, Or dronke, or smelt, or tane, or found, or bought, Such Nectar droppes as she with him had dronke, (But this were true) she wisht hir soule were sonke. And to conclude, she sayde no printed rymes, Could please hir so as his brave Triumphes dyd: Why wander I? She cov'red all hir crimes, With deepe disceipt, and all hir guiles she hyd, With fained teares, and Bartholmew she ryd With double gyrthes, she byt and whyned both, And made him love where he had cause to loth. These be the fruictes which grow on such desire, These are the gaines ygot by such an art, To late commes he that seekes to quenche the fire, When flames possesse the house in every part, Who lyst in peace to keepe a quiet hart. Flye love betimes, for if he once oretake him, Then seeld or never shall he well forsake him. If once thou take him Tenaunt to thy brest, No wrytte nor force can serve to plucke him thence, No pylles can purge his humour lyke the rest, He bydes in bones, and there takes residence, Against his blowes no bucklar makes defence. And though (with paine) thou put him from thy house, Yet lurkes hee styll in corners lyke a Mouse. At every hole he creepeth in by stelth, And privilye he feedeth on thy crommes, With spoiles unseene he wasteth all thy welth, He playes boe peepe when any body commes, And dastardlik he seemes to dread the drommes, Although in deede in Embushe he awaytes, To take thee stragling yf thou passe his straites. So seemed now by Bartholmews successe, Who yeelded sone unto this second charge, Accusing styll him selfe for his distresse, And that he had so languished at large, Short worke to make: he had none other charge To beare loves blowes, but styll to trust hir tale, And pardon crave because he bread hir bale. And thus he lyvde contented styll with craft, Mistrusting most, that gave least cause of doubt, He fledde mishappe and helde it by the haft, He banisht bale and bare it styll about, He let in love and thought to hold him out. He seemde to bathe in perfect blisse againe, When (God he knowes) he fostred privie paine. For as the Tree which crooked growes by kinde, (Although it be with propping underset) In trackt of time to crooked course wyll twinde, So could Ferenda never more forget, The lease at large where she hir flinges had fet. But rangde againe, and to hir byas fell, Such chaunges chaunce where lust (for love) doth dwell. And as it hapt (and God his wyll it was) Dan Bartholmew perceyvde it very plaine, So that perforce he let his pleasures passe, And strave no more against the streame in vaine, But therewithall he purchased such paine, As yet I shrinke in minde thereof to muse, And marvaile more howe he the same could use. His lustlesse limmes which wonted were to syt, In quiet chaire, with pen and paper prest, Were armed nowe with helme and harnesse fyt, To seeke adventures boldly with the best, Hee went to warres that wont to live in rest. And warres in deede he made withouten blowes, For why his friendes were nowe become his foes. Such was his hap to warre both night and daye, To watche and warde at every time and tyde, Though foes were farre yet skowted he alwaye, And when they came he must their brontes abide. Who ever fled he would his head not hyde. For sure dispayre his corpse so close had armed, That by deathes darte he could no whit be harmed. In his Ensigne these collours gan he chuse, Blacke, white, and greene, first blacke for morning mone, Then white for chaste, because he did refuse, (Thenceforth) to thinke but even of hir alone. A bende of greene: for though his joyes were gone, Yet should it seeme he hoped for a daye, And in that bende his name he dyd displaye. That selfe same name which in his will he wrote, (You knowe my minde) when he was out of tune a, When he subscribde (which may not bee forgote) Howe that his name was Fato Non F[o]rtuna. And as I gesse bicause his love was Una, That played hir pranckes according to hir kinde, He wrote these wordes hir best excuse to finde. As who should saye, lo destenies me drive, And happe could not have overthrowen me thus: I constrew this because I do beleeve, That once againe he wyll bee amorous, I fere it muche by him that dyed for us, And who so doubtes that causeles thus I faint Let him but reade the greene Knights heavy plaint Bartello he which writeth ryding tales, Bringes in a Knight which cladde was all in greene, That sighed sore amidde his greevous gales, And was in hold as Bartholmew hath beene. But (for a placke) it maye therein be seene, That, that same Knight which there his griefes begonne, Is Batts owne Fathers Sisters brothers Sonne. Well since my borrell braine is all to bloont To give a gesse what ende this man shall have, And since he rageth not as he was woont, Although sometimes he seeme (alite) to crave, Yet wyll I not his doinges so deprave, As for to judge (before I see his ende) What harder happe his angrie starres can sende. And therewithall my wearye muse desires, To take her rest: and pardon craves also, That shee presumde to bring hir selfe in bryers, By penning thus this true report of wo: With sillye grace these sorye rimes maye go, In such a rancke as Bartholmew hath plast, So that shee feares hir cunning is disgrast. But take them yet in gree as they be ment, And wayle with mee the losse of such a man: I coumpt him lost because I see him bent, To yeld againe where first his greefe began, And though I cannot write as others can Some mournefull verse to move you mone his fall, Yet weepe (with me) you faythfull lovers all. Finis. quod Dixit &amp; Dixit. Lenvoye. Syr Salamanke to thee this tale is tolde, Peruse it well and call unto thy minde, The pleasaunt place where thou dydst first behold The rewfull rymes: remember how the Winde Dyd calmelye blowe: and made me leave behinde, Some leaves thereof: whiles I sate reading styll, And thou then seemdst to hearken with good wyll. Beleeve me nowe, hadst thou not seemd to lyke The wofull wordes of Bartholmews discourse, They should have lyen styll drowned in the dyke, Lyke Sybylls leaves which flye with lytle force, But for thou seemdst to take therein remorce, I sought againe in corners of my brest, To finde them out and place them with the rest. Such skyll thou hast to make me (foole) beleeve, My bables are as brave as any bee, Well since it is so, let it never greeve Thy friendly minde this worthlesse verse to see In print at last: for trust thou unto mee, Thine onely prayse dyd make me venture forth, To set in shewe a thing so litle worth. Thus unto thee these leaves I recommend, To reade, to raze, to view, and to correct, Vouchsafe (my friend) therein for to amend That is amisse, remember that our sect, Is sure to bee with floutes alwayes infect. And since most mockes wyll light uppon my muse, Vouchsafe (my friend) hir faultes for to peruse. Tam Marti quam Mercurio. The fruites of Warre, written uppon this Theame, Dulce Bellum inexpertis, and it was written by peecemeale at sundrye tymes, as the Aucthour had vacaunt leysures from service, being begon at Delfe in Hollande, and dyrected to the ryght honourable the Lord Greye of Wylton as appeareth by the Epistle Dedicatory next following. To the Right honorable and mine especiall good Lorde, The Lorde Greye of Wylton. Dulce bellum inexpertis. [1] To write of Warre and wote not what it is, Nor ever yet could march where War was made, May well be thought a worke begonne amis, A rash attempt, in woorthlesse verse to wade, To tell the triall, knowing not the trade: Yet such a vaine even nowe doth feede my Muse, That in this theame I must some labor use. 2 And herewithal I cannot but confesse, Howe unexpert I am in feates of warre: For more than wryting doth the same expresse, I may not boast of any cruell jarre, Nor vaunt to see full valiant facts from farre: I have nor bene in Turkie, Denmarke, Greece, Ne yet in Colch, to winne a Golden fleece. 3 But nathelesse I some what reade in writte, O[f] high exploits by Martiall men ydone, And thereupon I have presumed yet, To take in hande this Poeme now begonne: Wherin I meane to tell what race they ronne, Who followe Drummes before they knowe the dubbe, And bragge of Mars before they feele his clubbe. 4 Which talk to tell, let first with penne declare à definito. What thing warre is, and wherof it proceeds, What be the fruites that fall unto their share That gape for honor by those haughtie deeds, What bloudie broyles in every state it breeds: A weary worke uneths I shall it write, Yet (as I may) I must the same endite. 5 The Poets olde in their fonde fables faine, That mightie Mars is god of Warre and Strife, Poetes &amp; Astronomers definition.These Astronomers thinke, where Mars doth raigne, That all [d]ebate and discorde must be rife, Some thinke Bellona goddesse of that life: So that some one, and some another judge, To be the cause of every greevous grudge. 6 Among the rest that Painter had some skill, Painters descriptionWhich thus in armes did once set out the same, A fielde of Geules, and on a Golden hill A stately towne consumed all with flame, On cheafe of Sable (taken from the dame) A sucking babe (oh) borne to bide myschaunce, Begoarde with bloud, and perced with a launce. 7 On high the Helme, I beare it well in minde, The Wreath was Silver poudred all with shot, About the which (gouttè du sang) did twinde A roll of Sable, blacke and foule beblot, The Creast two handes, which may not be forgot, For in the Right a trenchand blade did stande, And in the Left a firie burning brande. 8 Thus Poets, Painters, and Astronomers, Have given their gesse this subject to define, Yet are those three, and with them travellers, Not best betrust among the Worthies nine, Their woordes and workes are deemed not divine: But why? God knowes (my matter not [t]o marre,) Unlesse it be bicause they faine to farre. 9 Well then, let see what sayth the common voice, Common peoples opinionThese olde sayde sawes, of warre what can they say? Who list to harken to their whispring noise, May heare them talke and tattle day by day, That Princes pryde is cause of warre alway: Plentie brings pryde, pryde plea, plea pine, pine peace, Peace plentie, and so (say they) they never cease. 10 And though it have bene thought as true as steele, Which people prate, and preach above the rest, Yet could I never any reason feele, To thinke Vox populi vox Dei est, As for my skill, I compt him but a beast, Which trusteth truth to dwell in common speeche, Where every lourden will become a leech. 11 Then what is warre? define it right at last, And let us set all olde sayde sawes aside, Let Poets lie, let Painters faigne as fast, Astronomers let marke how starres do glide, And let these Travellers tell wonders wide: But let us tell by trustie proufe of truth, What thing is warre which raiseth all this ruth. 12 And for my parte my fansie for to wright, I say that warre is even the scourge of God, The Author definition. Tormenting such as dwell in princelie plight, Yet not regarde the reaching of his rodde, Whose deedes and dueties often times are odde, Who raunge at randon jesting at the just, As though they raignde to do even what they lust. 13 Whome neyther plague can pull into remorse, Nor dearth can drawe to mende that is amisse, Within whose hearts no pitie findeth force, Nor right can rule to judge what reason is. Whome sicknesse salveth not, nor bale brings blisse: Yet can high Jove by waste of bloudie warre, Sende scholemaisters to teach them what they are. 14 Then since the case so plaine by proufe doth stande, That warre is such, and such alwayes it was, Howe chaunceth then that many take in hande To joy in warre, whiles greater pleasures passe? Who compt the quiet Burgher but an Asse, That lives at ease contented with his owne, Whiles they seeke more and yet are overthrowne. 15 If Mars moove warre, as Starcoonners can tel, And Poets eke in fables use to faine, Or if Bellona cause mennes heartes to swell By deadly grudge, by rancor or dysdaine, Then what delight may in that life remaine? Where anger, wrath, teene, mischiefe and debate, Do still upholde the pillers of the State? 16 If Painters craft have truly warre dysplayde, Then is it woorsse (and badde it is at best) Where townes destroyde, and fields with bloud berayde, Yong children slaine, olde widdowes foule opprest, Maydes ravished, both men and wives distrest: Short tale to make, where sworde and cindring flame Consume as much as earth and ayre may frame. 17 If pryde make warre (as common people prate) Then is it good (no doubt) as good may bee, For pryde is roote of evill in everie state, The sowrse of sinne, the very feend his fee, The head of Hell, the bough, the braunch, the tree, From which do spring and sproute such fleshlie seedes, As nothing else but moane and myschiefe breedes. 18 But if warre be (as I have sayde before) Gods scourge, which doth both Prince and people tame, Then warne the wiser sorte by learned lore, To flee from that which bringeth naught but blame, And let men compt it griefe and not a game, To feele the burden of Gods mightie hande, When he concludes in judgement for to stande. 19 Oh Prince be pleasde with thine owne diademe, Prince.Confine thy countries with their common boundes, Enlarge no lande, ne stretch thou not thy streame, Penne up thy pleasure in Repentance poundes, Least thine owne sworde be cause of all thy woundes: Claime nought by warre where title is not good, It is Gods scourge, then Prince beware thy bloud. 20 Oh Dukes, oh Earls, oh Barons, Knights &amp; squiers, Kepe you content with that which is your owne, Nobilitie. Let braverie never bring you in his briers, Seeke not to mowe where you no seede have sowne, Let not your neighbors house be overthrowne, To make your garden straight, round, even and square, For that is warre, (Gods scourge) then Lordes beware. 21 Oh bishops, deacons, prelates, priests and all, Strive not for tythes, for glebelande, nor for fees, Prelacie. For polling Peter pens, for popish Pall, For proud pluralities, nor newe degrees, And though you thinke it lubberlike to leese, Yet shoulde you lende that one halfe of your cote: Then Priests leave warre, and learne to sing that note. 22 Oh lawlesse Lawyers, stoppe your too long nose, Wherwith you smell your needie neighbors lacke, Lawyers. Which can pretende a title to suppose, And in your rules uplandish loutes can racke, Till you have brought their wealth unto the wracke: This is plaine warre, although you terme it strife, Which God will scourge, then Lawyers leave this life. 23 Oh Merchants make more conscience in an oth, Sell not your Silkes by danger nor deceyte, Breake not your bankes with coine and credite bothe, Merchants. Heape not your hoordes by wilinesse of weyght, Set not to sale your subtilties by sleight, Breede no debate by bargayning for dayes, For God will skourge such guiles tenne thousand wayes. 24 Oh countrie clownes, your closes see you keepe, Husbandmen. With hedge, &amp; ditche, &amp; marke your meade with meares, Let not dame flatterie in your bosome creepe, To tell a fittone in your Landlordes eares, And say the ground is his as playne appeares. Where you but set the bounders foorth to farre: Plie you the plough and be no cause of warre. 25 Oh common people clayme nothing but right, C?munaltie.And ceasse to seeke that you have never lost, Strive not for trifles: make not all your might, To put your neighbours purse to needelesse cost, When your owne gilte is spent, then farewell frost: The Lawyer gaynes, and leades a Lordly lyfe, Whiles you leese all and begge to stinte your stryfe. 26 Knew Kings and Princes what a payne it were, To winne mo realmes than any witte can weelde, To pine in hope, to fret as fast for feare, To see their subjects murdred in the field, To loose at last, and then themselves to yeeld, To breake sounde sleepe with carke and inward care, They would love peace, and bidde warre well to fare. 27 If noble men and gentle bloodes yborne, Wist what it were to have a widdowes curse, Knew they the skourge of God (which wr?gs doth skorne) Who sees the poore still wronged to the worse, Yet stayes revenge till he it list disburse: Wist they what were to catche Gods afterclappes, Then would they not oppresse somuch perhappes. 28 These spirituall Pastors, nay these spitefull Popes, Which ought to lende a lanterne to the rest, Had they themselves but light to see the ropes, And snares of Hell which for their feete are drest, Bicause they pill and pole, bycause they wrest. Bycause they covet more than borrell men, (Harde be their hartes) yet would they tremble then. 29 Lawyers and Marchants put them both yfeare, Could they foresee how fast theyr heyres lashe out, If they in minde this old Proverbe could beare, De bonis malepartis vix (through out) Gaudebit tertius hæres out of doubt, They would percase more peace than plea procure, Since goods ill got, so little time endure. 30 Whiles Pierce the Plowm? hopes to picke a th?ke, By moving boundes (which got skarce graze his goose) His Landlord lawes so long to winne that banke, Till at the last the Ferme and all flies loose, Then farewell Pierce the man proves but a mouse, And seekes a cottage if he could one get, So fayre he fisht by moving mischief yet. 31 If common people could foresee the fine, Which lights at last by lashing out at lawe, Then who best loves this question, Myne or Thyne, Would never grease the greedy sergeants pawe, But sit at home and learne this old sayde sawe, Had I revenged bene of every harme, My coate had never kept me halfe so warme. 32 But whether now? my wittes are went awrie, I have presumde to preache to long God wote, Where mine empryse was well to testifie How sweet warre is to such as knowe it not, I have but toucht their yll luck and their lot, Which are the cause why strife and warres begin, Nought have I sayd of such as serve therein. 33 And therwithal I termed have all strife, All quarells, contecks, and all cruell jarres, Oppressions, bryberes, and all greedy life, To be (in genere) no bet than warres, Wherby my theame is stretcht beyond the starres, And I am entred in a field so large, As to much matter doth my Muse surcharge. 34 But as the hawke which soareth in the skie, And clymbes aloft for sollace of hir wing, The greater gate she getteth up on highe, The truer stoupe she makes at any thing: So shall you see my Muse by wandering, Finde out at last the right and ready way, And kepe it sure though earst it went astray. 35 My promisse was, and I recorde it so, To write in verse (God wot though lyttle worth) That warre seemes sweete to such as little knowe What commes therby, what frutes it bringeth forth: Who knowes none evil his minde no bad abhorth, But such as once have fealt the skortching fire, Will seldome (efte) to play with flame desire. 36 Then warre is badde: and so it is in deede, Yet are three sortes which therin take delight, But who they be now herken and take heede, For (as I may) I meane their names to wright, The first hight Haughtie harte, a man of might, The second Greedy minde most men do call, And Miser (he the mome) c?mes last of all. 37 As for the first, three sparkes of mighty moode Haughty harts.Desire of fame, disdayne of Idlenesse, And hope of honor, so inflame his bloud, That he haunts warre to winne but worthinesse, His doughty deedes alwayes declare no lesse: For whyles most men for gaines or malice fight, He gapes for glory setting lyfe but light. 38 O noble mind: alas and who could thinke, So good a hart so hard a happe should have? A sweete perfume to fall into a sinke, A costly jewell in a swelling wave, Is happe as harde as if in greedy grave, The lustiest lyfe should shryned be perforce, Before dyre deathe gyve sentence of divorce. 39 And such I counte the happe of Haughty hart, Which hunts (nought els) but honor for to get, Where treason, malyce, sicknesse, sore and smarte, With many myschieves moe his purpose let, And he meane while (which might have spent it bet) But loseth time, or doth the same mispend, Such guerdons gives the wicked warre at end. 40 I set aside to tell the restlesse toyle, The mangled corps, the lamed limbes at last, The shortned yeares by fret of fevers foyle, The smoothest skinne with skabbes and skarres disgrast, The frolicke favour frounst and foule defast, The broken sleepes, the dreadfull dreames, the woe, Which wonne with warre and cannot from him goe. 41 I list not write (for it becommes me not) The secret wrath which God doth kindle oft, To see the sucklings put unto the pot, To heare their giltlesse bloode send cries alofte, And call for vengeance unto him, but softe The Souldiours they commit those heynous actes, Yet Kings and Captaynes answere for such factes. 42 What neede me now at large for to rehearse, The force of Fortune, when she list to frowne? Why should I heere display in barreyne verse, How realmes are turned topsie turvie downe, How Kings and Keysars loose both clayme and crowne? Whose haughty harts to hent all honour haunte, Till high mishaps their doughtiest deedes do daunte. 43 All these with mo my penne shall overpasse, Since Haughty harte hath fixt his fansie thus, Let chaunce (sayeth he) be fickell as it was, Sit bonus (in re mala) Animus, Nam omne solum viro forti Ius. And fie (sayeth he) for goods or filthie gaine, I gape for glorie, all the rest is vayne. 44 Vayne is the rest, and that most vayne of all, A smouldring smoke which flieth with every winde, A tickell treasure, like a trendlyng ball, A passing pleasure mocking but the minde, A fickle fee as fansie well can finde. A sommers fruite whiche long can never last, But ripeneth soone, and rottes againe as fast. 45 And tell me Haughty harte, confesse a truth, What man was aye so safe in Glories porte, But traynes of treason (oh the more the ruth) Could undermine the Bulwarkes of this forte, And raze his ramparts downe in sundrie sorte? Searche all thy bookes, and thou shalt finde therein, That honour is more harde to holde than winne. 46 Aske Julius Cæsar if this tale be true, Cæsar.The man that conquered all the world so wide, Whose onely worde commaunded all the crue, Of Romayne Knights at many a time and tide, Whose pompe was thought so great it could not glide. At last with bodkins dubd and doust to death, And all his glorie banisht with his breath. 47 Of malice more what should I make discource, Than thy foule fall proude Pompey by thy name, Pompey.Whose swelling harte envying Cæsars force, Did boyle and burne in will and wicked flame, By his downe fall thy fonder clyme to frame, Till thine owne head bebathed with enmies teares, Did ende thy glorie with thy youthfull yeares. 48 Alas alas how many may we reade, Whome sicknesse sithe hath cut as greene as grasse? Whome colde in Campes hath chaungd as pale as leade? Whose greace hath molt all caffed as it was, With charges given, with skarmouching in chasse? Some lamed with goute (soone gotten in the field) Some forst by fluxe all glorie up to yeeld. 49 Of sodayne sores, or clappes caught unaware, By sworde, by shotte, by mischief, or by mine, What neede I more examples to declare, Montacute Earle of Salisbury.Then Montacute which died by doome devine? For when he had all France defayct, in fine, From lofty towre discovering of his foes, A Cannons clappe did all his glorie lose. 50 I had forgot (wherein I was to blame) Of bolde brave Bourbon somewhat for to say That Haughty hart whome never Prince could tame, Whome neyther towne could stoppe nor wall let way, Borbon. Nor king nor Keyser could his jorney stay: His Epitaph downe set upon his Tombe Declares no lesse: I leave it to your doome. Devicto Gallo, Aucto Imperio, Pontifice obsesso, Italia superata, Roma capta, Borbonii hoc marmor habet cineres.Borbons Epitaph.51 Oh glorious title ringing out renowne, Oh Epitaph of honor and high happe, Who reades the same as it is there set downe, Would thinke that Borbon sate in fortunes lappe, And could not fall by chaunce of after clappe: Yet he that wrote this thundring flattering verse, Left out one thing which I must needes rehearse. 52 For when he had his king by warre foredone, Enlargde the Empyre and besiegde the Pope, Tane Rome, and Italy had overronne, Yet was he forst, alwayes from lawes to lope, And trudge from triall so to scape the rope: Yea more than that a banisht man be served, Least loved of them whose thanks he most deserved. 53 Lo lordings here a lesson for the nones, Behold this glasse and see yourselves therein, This Epitaph was writte for worthy ones, For Haughty harts which honor hunt to winne. Beware beware, what broyles you do begin. For smiling lucke hath oft times Finem duram, And therefore thinke possit victoria Curam. 54 And yet if glory do your harts inflame, Or hote desire a haughty name to have, Or if you thirst for high renowne or fame, To blase such brute as time might not deprave, You leese the labour that you might well save: For many a prayse in that meane while you past, Which (bet than warre) might make your name to last. 55 As first (percase) you skipt Phylosophie, That noble skill which doth surmount the rest, Wherto if you had tied your memorie, Then bruntes of warre had never bruzde your brest, Yet had our name bene blazde, and you bene blest: Aristotle.AskeAristotle if I speake amis, Fewe Souldiers fame can greater be than his. 56 Next Rethorike, that hoonnie harmelesse arte, Which conquers moe than warre can well subdue, You past it by, and therfore loose your parte Of glories great, which thereunto are due, And might by right your names for aye renue: Cicero.Such glory loe did Cicero attaine, Which longer lasts, than other glories vaine. 57 Avicene.Of Physike speake for me king Avicen, Who more esteemde the meane to save himselfe, Than lessons leude of proude ambitious men, Which make debate for mucke and worldly pelfe: Yet was his glory never set on shelfe, Nor never shal, whyles any worlde may stande, Where men have minde to take good bookes in hande. 58 What shoulde I stretch into Astronomie? Or marvels make of Musikes sugred sounde? Or beate my braynes about Geometrie? Or in Arithmetike of artes the grounde? Since evermore it is and hath been founde, That who excels in any of the same, Is sure to winne an everlasting fame. 59 My meaning is no more but to declare, That Haughtie hartes do spende their time in vaine, Which followe warres, and bring themselves in snare, Of sundrie ylls, and many a pinching paine, Whiles if they list to occupie their braine, In other feates with lesser toile ygot, They might have fame when as they have it not. 60 Well, Greedie minde is of another moode, That man was framde out of some other molde, Greedy minde He followes warres for wealth and worldlie good, To fill his purse with grotes and glistring golde, He hopes to buie that Haughtie harte hath solde: He is as hote as any man at spoile, But at a breach he keepeth no such coyle. 61 Alas good Greedie minde, and canst thou finde No better trade, to fill thy boystrous baggs? Is wittte nowe wente so wandring from thy minde? Are all thy points so voide of Reasons taggs? Well so mayst thou come roysting home in raggs, And lose thy time as Haughtie harte doth eke, Whiles like a dolt thou wealth in warre dost seke. 62 O bleareyde foole, are both thine eyes beblast? Canst thou not see? looke up (what man?) God mend thee, Looke at these Lawyers howe they purchase fast, Marke wel these Marchants (better minde God send thee) See howe the sutes of silke that they woulde lende thee, And many mo so fine in fashion stande, Till at the last they pay for unthriftes lande. 63 The Grasier gets by feeding fatte his neate, The Clothier coynes by carding locks of wooll, The Butcher buildes by cutting out of meate, The Tanners hydes do fill his budget full, The Sheep maister his olde cast croanes can cull, The Shoomaker can shift by shaping shooes, The Craftie bawde can live by keeping stewes. 64 The gorgeous Goldesmith getts the Divell and all, The Haberdasher heapeth wealth by hattes, The Barber lives by handling of his ball, The Coupers house is heelde by hooping fattes, The Roge rubbes out by poysoning of Rattes, The Chanell raker liveth by his fee, Yet compt I him more worthie prayse than thee. 65 To rake up rytches evermore by wrong, To multiplie by mooving of myschiefe, To live by spoile which seeldome lasteth long, To hoorde up heapes whiles others lacke reliefe, To winne all wealth by playing of the theefe, Is not so good a gaine I dare avowe, As his that lives by toyling at the plowe. 66 And yet the drudge that delveth in the grounde, The poorest pesant and the homeliest hinde, The meanest man that ever yet was founde, To get a gaine by any trade or kinde, Lives more at rest and hath more ease of minde, More sure to winne, much lesser dread to leese, Than any page that lives by Mars his fees. 67 Ne will I yet affray the doubtfull hartes Of such as seeke for welth in warre to fal, By thundring out the sundrie sodaine smartes Which daily chaunce as fortune trilles the ball: Suffiseth this to proove my theame withall, That every bullet hath a lighting place, Though Greedie minde forseeth not that disgrace. 68 The myst of More would have, doth bleare his eyes, So is he armde with avarice alway, And as he covets more than may suffise, So is he blinde and dazled day by day, For whiles he ventures for a double pay, He quite forgets the pay that payes for all, Til Leade (for Golde) do glut his greedie gal. 69 Yea though he gaine &amp; cram his purse with crounes, And therewith scape the foemens force in fielde, He nought foreseeth what treasons dwells in Townes, Ne what mishappes his yll got goods may yeelde: For so may chaunce (and seene it is not seelde) His owne companions can contrive a meane, To cutte his throate and rinse his budgets cleane. 70 But if he wist, or had the witte to knowe, What dangers dwell, where might beares right adowne, What inwarde griefes to quiet mindes may growe By greedie thyrst of ryches or renowne, Where wrong of warre oft times erects the crowne, He would percase confesse among the rest, That Dulce bellum inexpertis est. 71 So that I say as earst I sayde before, That even as Haughtie harte doth hunt in vaine, Which seekes to winne most honor evermore, By haunting warres: so can I see no gaine, (With calme content) to feede that others vaine: Wherfore my worde is still (I change it not) That Warre seemes sweete to such as raunge it not. 72 Well then, let see what reason or what rule Can Miser move, to march among the rest: Miser. I meane not Miser he that sterves his Mule For lacke of meate: no that were but a jest: My Miser is as brave (sometimes) as best, Where if he were a snudge to spare a groate, Then Greedie minde and he might weare one coate. 73 But I by Miser meane the very man, Which is enforst by chip of any chaunce, To steppe aside and wander nowe and than, Till lowring lucke may pipe some other daunce, And in meane while yet hopeth to advaunce His staylesse state, by sworde, by speare, by shielde, Such bulwarkes (loe) my Misers braine doth builde. 74 The forlorne hope, which have set up their rest By rash expence, and knowe not howe to live, The busie braine that medleth with the best, And gets dysgrace his rashnesse to repreeve, The man that slewe the wight that thought to theeve, Such and such moe which flee the Catchpols fist, I compt them Misers, though the Queene it wist. 75 And yet forsooth these love to live in warre, When (God he knowes) they wote not what it meanes, Where if they sawe how much deceyved they are, Whiles they be brought into mine uncles beanes, And hoppe in hazarde by their headie meanes: Then woulde they learne and love to live at home, Much rather yet than wide in warres to rome. 76 The unthrift he that selles a roode of lande, Unthriftes.For Flemish stickes of Silkes and such like wares, Weenes yet at last to make a happie hande By bloudie warre, and hopes to shredde such shares, In goods yll got to countervaile his cares, That he may once recover his estate, To royst againe in spite of Catchpolles pate. 77 The restlesse tong [that] tattleth still at large, Praters.Till just correction cause it to be still, Is banisht oft, and sitts in Misers barge, To brydle so the wandring of his will: Yet when he heares a trumpet sounding shrill, He followes fast, and to himselfe he sayes, Nowe can I keepe me out of Catchpols wayes. 78 The bloudie murdrer and the craftie theefe, Felons.Which have by force or fraude done what offence, To creepe in corners, oh they thinke it leefe, Though Miser there do pay for their expence: But when they heare a pay proclaimde for pence, Loe then they trudge, and gape to get such wealth, As may discharge their heads from hangmans health. 79 Of these thre sortes full many have I seene, Some hate the streates, bicause the stones were hot, Some shunde the Court (&amp; though they lovde our Queene) Yet in the Counsellors wayes they stumbled not, Some might not drinke of Justice Griffyns pot: But all and some had rather fight with foes, Than once to light within the lappes of those. 80 As for the first what neede I much to wright? Since now adayes the Sunne so hote doth shine, That fewe yong blouds (unlesse it be by night) Can byde the streates: no, narrowe lanes be fine, Where every shade may serve them for a shrine: But in Cheapside the Sunne so scaldes the streete, That every paving stone would partch their feete. 81 So of the seconde somwhat coulde I say, Howe tattling tungs and busie byting pennes, Have fledde from Court long sithens many a day, And bene full gladde to lurke in Misers dennes, Some for their owne speech, some for other mennes, Some for their bookes bicause they wrote too much, Yea some for rymes, but sure I knowe none such. 82 And for the thirde, I cannot blame them I, If they at barre have once helde up their hande, And smelt the smoke which might have made them frie, Or learnde the leape out of their native lande, Me thinke if then their cause be rightly scande, That they should more delight to follow drummes, Than byde at home to come in hangmans thumbes. 83 But holla yet, and lay a strawe thereby, For whyles they scape for one offence or twaine, They goe so long to schole with fellonie, And learne such lessons in the Soldiers traine, That all delayes are dalied but in vaine: For commonly at their home come they pay, The debt which hangman claimde earst many a day. 84 How much were better then, with contrite harte First to repent, and then to make amendes? And therwithall to learne by troubles smarte, What sweete repose the lawfull life us lendes: For when such plagues the mightie God us sendes, They come aswell to scourge offences past, As eke to teach a better trade at last. 85 And eke how much were better for the first, To beare lowe sayle, beginne the worlde anewe, And stande content to muster with the worst, Till God convey them to some better crewe, It better were to bydde all pryde adieu, And stoupe betimes in hope to ryse againe, Than still to strive against the streame in vaine. 86 So were more meete for mealy mouthed men, And busie medlers with their Princes mates, Wryters and rimers for to turne their penne In humble style unto the loftie states, And eke with tongue attending at their gates, In lowly wise their favour to beseeche, Than still to stande in stoute and sturdie speech. 87 But mighty Mars hath many men in store, Which wayte alwayes to keepe his kingdome up, Of whome no one doth shewe his service more, Than lingring Hope which still doth beare his cuppe, And flatteringly lendes every man a suppe, Which haunts his courte or in his progresse passe. Hope brings the bolle whereon they all must quasse. 88 Th'ambitious Prince doth hope to conquer all, The Dukes, Earles, Lords, &amp; Knights hope to be kings, The Prelates hope to pushe for Popish pall, Hope is cupbearer to war.The Lawyers hope to purchase wonderous things, The Merchaunts hope for no lesse reckenings, The peasant hopes to get a Ferme at least, All men are guestes where Hope doth holde the feast. 89 Amongst the rest poore Miser is so drie, And thristeth so to taste of some good chaunge That he in haste to Hope runnes by and by. And drinkes so deepe (although the taste be straunge,) That madding moode doth make his wittes to raunge, And he runnes on w[h]ere Hope doth leade the way, Most commonly (God knowes) to his decaye. 90 So that for companie he sings the same, Which Haughty harte and Greedy minde do sing He saieth that Bellum breedeth grief of game: And though at first it seeme a pleasant thing At last (sayeth he) it striketh with a sting, And leaves a skarre although the wound be heald, Which gives disgrace and cannot be conceald. 91 To prove this true how many in my dayes, (And I for one) might be rehearced here, Who after proofe of divers wandring wayes, Have bene constreynd to sit with sorie cheere, Close in a corner fumbled up for feare? Till fr? such dennes, drummes dubbe hath calld th? forth, To chaunge their chaunce for lottes (ofte) little worth. 92 But here (me thinks) I heare some carping tong, That barkes apace and killes me with his crie, [M]e thinkes he sayes that all this geare goeth wrong, When workes of warre are wrotte by such as I, Me thinkes I heare him still this text applie, That evill may those presume to teache a trade, Which nay themselves in Schollers roome did wade. 93 And for bycause my selfe confessed have, That (more than might by writte expressed be) I may not seeme above my skill to brave, Since yet mine eyes the warres did never see: Therefore (say some) how fonde a foole is he, That takes in hande to write of worthy warre, Which never yet hath come in any jarre? 94 No jarre (good sir) yes yes and many jarres, For though my penne of curtesie did putte, A difference twixt broyles and bloudie warres, Yet have I shot at maister Bellums butte, And throwen his ball although I toucht no tutte: I have percase as deepely dealt the dole, As he that hit the marke and gat the gole. 95 Flushyng frayes &amp; fleesing of Flaunders.For I have seene full many a Flushyng fraye, And fleest in Flaunders eke among the rest, The bragge of Bruges, where was I that daye? Before the walles good sir as brave as best, And though I marcht all armde withouten rest, From Aerdenburgh and back againe that night, Yet madde were he that would have made me knight. 96 So was I one forsooth that kept the towne, Of Aerdenburgh (withouten any walles) Aerdenburgh.From all the force that could be dressed downe, By Alba Duke for all his cries and calles, A high exployte. Wee held the Flemings thralles, Seven dayes and more without or bragges or blowes, For all that while we never herd of foes. 97 I was againe in trench before Tergoes, Tergoes.(I dare not say in siege for bothe mine eares) For looke as oft as ever Hell brake lose, I meane as often as the Spainish peares, Made salie foorth (I speake this to my pheares) It was no more but which Cock for a groate, Such troupes we were to keepe them up in coate. 98 Yet surely this withouten bragge or boast, Our English bloudes did there full many a deede, Which may be Chronicled in every coaste, For bolde attempts, and well it was agreed, That had their heades bene rulde by warie heede, Some other feate had bene attempted then, To shew their force like worthie English men. 99 Since that siege raysde I romed have about, In Zeeland, Holland, Waterland, and all, By sea, by land, by ayre, and all throughout, As leaping lottes, and chance did seeme to call, Now here, now there, as fortune trilde the ball, Where good The Prince of Orenge his name is Guillam of Nassau. Guyllam of Nassau badde me be, There needed I none other guyde but he. 100 Percase sometimes S. Gyptians pilgrymage, Did carie me a moneth (yea sometimes more) To brake the Bowres, and racke them in a rage, Bicause they had no better cheere in store, Beefe, Mutton, Capon, Plover, Pigeons, Bore, All this was naught, and for no Souldiours toothe, Were these no jarres? (speake now Sir) yes forsoothe. 101 And by my troth to speake even as it is, Such prankes were playde by Souldiours dayly there, And though my self did not therein amisse, (As God he knowes and men can witnesse beare,) Yet since I had a charge, I am not cleare, For seldome climes that Captaine to renowne, Whose Souldiours faults so plucke his honour downe. 102 Well let that passe. I was in rolling trench, At Ramykins, where little shotte was spent, Ramykins. For gold and groates their matches still did quenche, Which kept the Forte, and forth at last they went, So pinde for hunger (almost tenne dayes pent) That men could see no wrincles in their faces, Their pouder packt in caves and privie places. 103 Next that I servde by night and eke by daie, By Sea, by lande, at every time and tide, Against A Coronel of the kings side. Mountdragon whiles he did assaie, To lande his men along the salt sea side, For well he wist that Ramykins went wide, And therfore sought with victuall to supplie, Poore Myddleburgh which then in suddes did lie. 104 And there I sawe full many a bold attempt, By seelie soules best executed aye, And bravest bragges (the foemens force to tempt) Accomplished but coldely many a daye, The Souldiour charge, the leader lope away, The willing drumme a lustie marche to sounde, Whiles ranke retyrers gave their enimies ground. 105 Againe at Sea the Souldiour forward still, When Mariners had little lust to fight, And whiles we staie twixt faynte and forward will, Our enemies prepare themselves to flight. They hoyste up sayle (o wearie woorde to wri[gh]t) They hoyste up saile that lacke both streame and windes, And we stand still so forst by frowarde mindes. 106 O victorie: (whome Haughty hartes do hunte) O spoyle and praye (which greedy mindes desire) O golden heapes (for whom these Misers wonte To follow Hope which settes all hartes on fire) O gayne, O golde, who list to you aspyre, And glorie eke, by bolde attempts to winne, There was a day to take your prisoners in. 107 The shippes retyre with riches full yfraught, The Souldiours marche (meane while) into the towne, The tide skarce good, the winde starke staring naught, The haste so hoate that (eare they sinke the sowne) They came on ground, and strike all sayles adowne: While we (ay me) by backward saylers ledde, Take up the worst when all the best are fledde. 108 Such tri?phs chance where such Lieuten?ts rule, Where will commaundes when skill is out of towne, Where boldest bloudes are forced to recule, By Simme the boteswayne when he list to frowne, Where Captaynes crouch, and fishers weare the Crowne. Such happes which happen in such haplesse warres, Make me to tearme them broyles and beastly jarres. 109 And in these broyles (a beastly broyle to wryte,) My Colonell, and I fell at debate, So that I left both charge and office quite, A Captaynes charge and eke a Martials state, Whereby I proved (perhaps though all to late) How soone they fall whiche leane to rotten bowes, Such faith finde they, that trust to some mens vowes. 110 My harte was high, I could not seeme to serve, In regiment where no good rules remayne, Where officers and such as well deserve, Shall be abusde by every page and swayne, Where discipline shall be but deemed vayne, Where blockes are stridde by stumblers at a strawe, And where selfe will must stand for martiall lawe. 111 These things (with mo) I could not seeme to beare, And thereupon I crackt my staffe in two, Yet stayde I still though out of pay I were, And learne to live as private Souldiours do, I lived yet, by God and lacked too: Till at the last when Beavois fledde amayne, Our campe removde to streine An Iland so called which was sore spoyled by our countrymen. the lande van Strayne. 112 When A Coronel of the kings side whiche was governour of Middelburgh next before Mo?tdragon. Beavois fledde, Mountdragon came to towne, And like a Souldiour Myddelburgh he kept, But courage now was coldly come adowne, On either side: and quietly they slept, So that my self from Zeland lightly lept, With full entent to taste our English ale, Yet first I ment to tell the Prince my tale. 113 For though the warres waxt colde in every place, And small experience was there to be seene, Yet thought I not to parte in such disgrace, Although I longed much to see our Queene: For he that once a hyred man hath bene, Must take his Maisters leave before he goe, Unlesse he meane to make his freend his foe. 114 Then went I straight to A towne in Holland. Delfe, a pleasant towne, Unto that Prince, whose passing vertues shine, And unto him I came on knees adowne, Beseeching that his excellence in fine, Would graunt me leave to see this countrey mine: Not that I wearie was in warres to serve, Nor that I lackt what so I did deserve. 115 But for I found some contecke and debate, In regiment where I was woont to rule, And for I founde the staie of their estate, Was forced now in townes for to recule, I craved leave no longer but till Christmas. Yewle, And promist then to come againe Sans fayle, To spende my bloud where it might him avayle. 116 The noble Prince gave graunt to my request, And made me passeporte signed with his seale, But when I was with baggs and baggage prest, The Prince began to ring another peale, And sent for me, (desiring for my weale) That I woulde stay a day or two, to see, What was the cause he sent againe for mee. 117 My Colonell was nowe come to the Courte, With whome the Prince had many things to treate, And for he hoapte, in good and godlie sorte, Tweene him and me to worke a friendlie feate, He like a gracious Prince his braines did beate, To set accorde betweene us if he might, Such paynes he toke to bring the wrong to right. 118 O noble Prince, there are too fewe like thee, If Vertue wake, she watcheth in thy will, If Justice live, then surely thou art hee, If Grace do growe, it groweth with thee still, O worthy Prince would God I had the skill, To write thy worth that men thereby might see, How much they erre that speake amisse of thee. 119 The simple Sottes do coumpt thee simple too, Whose like for witte our age hath seldome bredde, The rayling roges mistrust thou darest not do, As Hector did for whom the Grecians fledde, Although thou yet werte never seene to dredde, The slandrous tongues do say thou drinkst to much, When God he knowes thy custome is not such. 120 But why do I in worthlesse verse devise, To write his prayse that doth excell so farre? He heard our greeves himself in gratious wise, And mildly ment to joyne our angry jarre, He ment to make that we beganne to marre: But wicked wrath had some so farre enraged, As by no meanes theyr malice could be swaged. 121 In this meane while the Spainiards came so neare That Delfe was girte with siege on every side, And though men might take shippyng every where, And so be gone at any time or tide, Yet truth to tell (I speake it for no pryde) I could not leave that Prince in such distresse, Which cared for me and yet the cause much lesse. 122 But see mishappe how craftely it creepes, Whiles fawning fortune fleareth full in face, My heavie harte within my bellie weepes, To recken here a droppe of darke disgrace, Which fell upon my pleasant plight apace, And brought a packe of doubts and dumps to passe, Whiles I with Prince in love and favour was. 123 A worthie dame whose prayse my penne shal write (My sworde shall eke hir honour still defende) A loving letter to me did endight, And from the Campe the same to me did sende, I meane from Campe where foes their force did bende: She sent a brief unto me by hir mayde, Which at the gates of Delfe was stoutely stayde. 124 This letter tane, I was mistrusted much, And thought a man that were not for to truste, The Burghers streight began to beare me grutche, The frute of fansie. And cast a snare to make my necke be trust, For when they had this letter well discust: They sent it me by hir that brought it so, To trie if I would keepe it close or no. 125 I redde the lines, and knowing whence they came, My harmelesse harte began to pant apace, Wel to be playne, I thought that never Dame, Should make me deale in any doubtfull case, Or do the thing might make me hide my face: So that unto the Prince I went forthwith, And shewed to him of all this packe the pith. 126 The thing God knowes was of no great emport, Some freendly lines the vertuous Lady wrote To me hir freend: and for my safe passeporte, The Camepomaster Valdes his hand was gotte, And seale therewith, that I might safely trotte, The pleasauntest village (as I thinke) that is in Europe.Unto the Haghe a stately pleasaunt place, Whereas remaynd this worthy womans grace. 127 And here I set in open verse to showe, The whole effect wherfore this work was wrought, She had of mine (whereof few folkes did knowe) A counterfayte, a thing to me deare bought, Which thing to have I many time had sought And when shee knew how much I did esteeme it Shee vowde that none but I should thence redeeme it. 128 Lo here the cause of all this secrete sleight, I sweare by Jove that nothing els was ment, The noble Prince (who sawe that no deceipt Was practised) gave trust to mine entent: And leave to write from whence the same was sent, But still the Bowgers (Burghers should I saye) Encreast their doubtes and watcht me day by day. 129 At every porte it was (forsoth) forbidden. belast, That I the Greene captaine. (die groene Hopman) might not go out, But when their foes came skirmishing full fast, Then with the rest the Greene knight for them fought, Then might he go without mistrust or doubt: O drunken plompes, I playne without cause why, For all cardes tolde there was no foole but I. 130 I was the foole to fight in your defence, Which know no freende, nor yet your selves full well, Yet thus you see how paye proclaymde for pence, Pulles needie soules in steade of heaven to hell, And makes men hope to beare away the bell. Whereas they hang in ropes that never rotte, Yet warre seemes sweete to such as know it not. 131 Well thus I dwelt in Delfe a winters tyde, In Delfe (I say) without one pennie pay: My men and I did colde and hunger bide, To shew our truth, and yet was never day, Wherein the Spanyard came to make us play, But that the Greene knight was amongst the rest, Like a proverbe. John Greyes birde that ventred with the best. 132 At last the Prince to Zeland came himselfe, To hunger Middle[b]urgh, or make it yeeld, And I that never yet was set on shelf, When any sayld, or winde, or waves could weeld, Went after him to shew my selfe in field. The selfe same man which earst I vowed to be, A trustie man to such a Prince as he. 133 The force of Flaunders, Brabant, Geldres, Fryze, Henault, Artoys, Lyegeland, and Luxembrough, Were all ybent, to bryng in new supplies To Myddleburgh: and little all enough, For why the protesta?ts. Gæulx would neyther bend nor bough. But one of force must breake and come to nought, All The Iland wherein Flushing doth stand. Walkers theirs, or Flushyng dearly bought. 134 There once agayne I served upon seas, And for to tell the cause and how it fell, It did one day the Prince (my chieftayne) please, To aske me thus: Gascoigne (quoth he) you dwell Amongst us still: and thereby seemeth well, That to our side you beare a faithfull harte, For else long since we should have seene you starte. 135 But are (sayde he) your Souldiours by your side? O Prince (quoth I) full many dayes be past, Since that my charge did with my Cronell glyde. Yet byde I here, and meane to be with last: And for full proofe that this is not a blast Of glorious talke: I crave some fisher boate, To shew my force among this furious floate. 136 The Prince gan like my fayth and forward will, Rigged up and fully furnished.Equyppt a Hoye and set hir under sayle, Wherein I served according to my skill, My minde was such, my cunning could not quayle, Withouten bragge of those that did assayle The foemens fleete which came in good aray, I put my selfe in formost ranke alway. 137 Three dayes wee fought, as long as water served, And came to ancor neyghbourlike yfeere, The Prince himselfe to see who best deserved, Stoode every day attending on the peere, And might behold what barke went formost there: Ill harte had he that would not stoutely fight, When as his Prince is present still in sight. 138 At last our foes had tidings over lande, That neare to a Towne. Bergh their fellowes went to wracke, On a River. Scheld they mette by Rymerswaell a bande Of Lusty gallants. Edellbloets, who put their force abacke, The admiral of flushing. Lewes de Boyzott did put them there to sacke, And lost an eye, bicause he would resemble Julian de Romero. Dan Juliane, whome (there) he made to tremble. 139 When this was knowen The castellane of Anwerp. Sancio de Avila, Who had the charge of those that fought with us, Went up the A River. Hont and tooke the ready way, To Anwerpe towne: leaving in daunger thus, Poore Myddelburgh which now waxt dolorous, To see all hope of succour shrinke away, Whiles they lackt bread and had done many a day. 140 And when Mountdragon might no more endure, He came to talke and rendred all at last, With whome I was within the Cittie sure, Before he went, and on his promisse past, Such trust I had to thinke his fayth was fast: I dinde, and supt, and laye within the towne, A daye before he was from thence ybowne. 141 Thus Middleburgh, Armew, and all the rest, Of Walkers Ile became the Princes pray, Who gave to me bycause I was so prest, At such a pinche, and on a dismall day, Three hundreth gilderns good above my pay. And bad me bide till his abilitie, Might better gwerdon my fidelitie. 142 I will not lie, these Gilderns pleasd me well, And much the more bycause they came uncraved, Though not unneeded as my fortune fell, But yet thereby my credite still was saved, My skores were payde, and with the best I braved, Till (lo) at last, an English newe relief, Came over seas, and Chester was their chief. 143 Of these the Prince perswaded me to take, A band in charge with Coronels consent, At whose requests I there did undertake, To make mine ensigne once againe full bent, And sooth to say, it was my full entent, To loose the sadle or the horse to winne, Such haplesse hope the Prince had brought me in. 144 Souldiours behold and Captaynes marke it well, How hope is harbenger of all mishappe, Hope is the herbenger of mishappe. Some hope in honour for to beare the bell. Some hope for gaine and venture many a clappe, Some hope for trust and light in treasons lappe. Hope leades the way our lodging to prepare, Where high mishap (ofte) keepes an Inne of care. 145 I hoapt to shew such force agaynst our foes, That those of Delf might see how true I was, I hopt in deede for to be one of those Whome fame should follow, where my feete should passe, I hoapt for gaynes and founde great losse alas: I hoapt to winne a worthy Souldiours name, And light on lucke which brought me still to blame. 146 In Valkenburgh (a fort but new begonne) With others moe I was ordeynde to be, And farre beforne the worke were half way done, Our foes set forth our sorie seate to see, They came in time, but cursed time for mee, They came before the courtine raysed were, One onely foote above the trenches there. 147 What should we do, foure ensignes lately prest, Five hundreth men were all the bulke we bare, Our enimies three thousand at the least, And somuch more they might alwayes prepare: But that most was, the truth for to declare, We had no store of pouder, nor of pence, Nor meate to eate, nor meane to make defence. 148 Here some may say that we were much to blame, Which would presume in such a place to byde, And not foresee (how ever went the game) Of meate and shotte our souldiours to provide: Who so do say have reason on their side, Yet proves it still (though ours may be the blot) That warre seemes sweete to such as know it not. 149 For had our forte bene fully fortified, Two thousand men had bene but few enow, To man it once, and had the truth bene tried, We could not see by any reason how, The Prince could send us any succour now, Which was constreynd in townes himself to shield, And had no power to shew his force in field. 150 Herewith we had nor powder packt in store, Nor flesh, nor fishe, in poudring tubbes yput, Nor meale, nor malt, nor meane (what would you more?) To get such geare if once we should be shut. And God he knowes, the English Souldiours gut, Must have his fill of victualles once a day, Or els he will but homely earne his pay. 151 To scuse ourselves, and Coronell withall, We did foretell the Prince of all these needes, Who promised alwayes to be our wall, And badde us trust as truely as our creedes, That all good wordes should be performd with deedes, And that before our foes could come so neare, He would both send us men and merrie cheare. 152 Yea Robyn Hoode, our foes came downe apace, And first they chargde another Forte likewise, Alphen I meane, which was a stronger place, And yet to weake to keepe in warlike wise: Five other bandes of English footemen. Fanteries, Were therein set for to defend the same, And them they chargde for to beginne the game. 153 This Forte fro ours was distant ten good miles, I meane such myles as English measure makes, Betweene us both stoode Leyden towne therewhiles, Which everie day with fayre wordes undertakes, To feede us fat and cramme us up with cakes: It made us hope it would supplie our neede, For we (to it) two Bulwarkes were in deede. 154 But when it came unto the very pinche, Leyden farewell, we might for Leyden sterve, I like him well that promiseth an inche, And payes an ell, but what may he deserve That flatters much and can no fayth observe? [An]d old sayd sawe, that fayre wordes make fooles fayne, Which proverbe true we proved to our payne. 155 A conference among our selves we cald, Of Officers and Captaynes all yfeere, For truth (to tell) the Souldiours were apald, And when we askt, nowe mates what merie cheere? Their aunswere was: it is no bidyng here. So that perforce we must from thence be gone, Unlesse we ment to keepe the place alone. 156 Herewith we thought that if in time we went, Before all streights were stopt and taken up, We might (perhaps) our enimies prevent, And teach them eke to taste of sorowes cuppe: At Maesland Sluyse, wee hoped for to suppe, A place whereas we might good service do, To keepe them out which tooke it after too. 157 Whiles thus we talke, a messenger behold, From Alphen came, and told us heavy newes, Captaynes (quoth he) hereof you may be bolde, Not one poore soule of all your fellowes crewes, Can scape alive, they have no choyse to chuse: They sent me thus to bidde you shifte in time, Els looke (like them) to sticke in Spainish lime. 158 This tale once tolde, none other speech prevaylde, But packe and trudge, al leysure was to long, To mende the marte, our watche (which never faylde) Descried our foes which marched all along, And towards us began in hast to throng, So that before our laste could passe the porte, The foremost foes were now within the Forte. 159 I promest once and did performe it too, To bide therein as long as any would, What booted that? or what could Captaynes doo, When common sorte would tarie for no gould? To speake a troth, the good did what they could, To keepe the badde in rankes and good araye, But labour lost to hold that will away. 160 It needelesse were to tell what deedes were donne, Nor who did best, nor who did worst that day, Nor who made head, nor who began to runne, Nor in retreate what chief was last alway, But Souldiour like we held our enimies play: And every Captayne strave to do his best, To stay his owne and so to stay the rest. 161 In this retyre three English miles we trodde, With face to foes and shot as thicke as hayle, Of whose choyce men full fiftie soules and odde, We layed on ground, this is withouten fayle, Yet of our owne, we lost but three by tale: Our foes themselves confest they bought full deere, The hote pursute whiche they attempted there. 162 Thus came we late at last to Leyden walles, Too late, too soone, and so may we well say, For notwithstanding all our cries and calles, They shut their gates and turnd their eares away: In fine they did forsake us every way, And badde us shifte to save ourselves apace, For unto them were fonde to trust for grace. 163 They neither gave us meate to feede upon, Nor drinke, nor powder, pickax, toole nor spade, So might we sterve, like misers woe begone, And fend our foes, with blowes of English blade, For shotte was shronke, and shift could none be made: Yea more than this, wee stoode in open fielde, Without defense from shotte our selves to shielde. 164 This thus wel weyed, wh? weary night was past, And day gan peepe, wee heard the Spainish drommes, Which stroke a marche about us round to cast, And foorth withall their Ensignes quickly c?mes, At sight whereof, our Souldiours bitte their th?mes: For well they wist it was no boote to flie, And biding there, there was no boote but die. 165 So that we sent a drumme to summone talke, And came to Parlee middle way betweene, Monsieur de Licques, and Mario did walke, From foemens side, and from our side were seene, My self, that matche for Mario might bene: And Captayne Sheffeld borne of noble race, To matche de Licques, which there was chief in place. 166 Thus met we talkt, and stoode upon our toes, With great demaundes whome little might content, We craved not onely freedome from our foes, But shippyng eke with sayles and all full bent, To come againe from whence we first were went: I meane to come, into our English coast, Which soyle was sure, and might content us most. 167 An old sayde sawe, (and ofte seene) that whereas, Thou comste to crave, and doubtst for to obtayne, Iniquum pete (then) ut æquum feras, This had I heard, and sure I was full fayne, To prove what profite we thereby might gayne: But at the last when time was stolen away, We were full gladde to play another play. 168 We rendred then with safetie for our lives, Our Ensignes splayed, and manyging our armes, With furder fayth, that from all kinde of gives, Our souldiours should remayne withouten harmes: And sooth to say, these were no false allarmes, For why? they were within twelve dayes discharged, And sent away from pryson quite enlarged. 169 They were sent home, and we remayned still, In pryson pent, but yet right gently used, To take our lives, it was not Licques will, (That noble blood, which never man abused,) Nor ever yet was for his faith accused, Would God I had the skill to write his prayse, Which lent me comfort in my dolefull dayes. 170 We bode behind, foure moneths or little lesse, But whereupon that God he knowes not I, Yet if I might be bolde to give a gesse, Then would I say it was for to espie, What raunsome we would pay contentedly: Or els to know how much we were esteemde, In England here, and for what men ydeemde. 171 How so it were, at last we were dispatcht, And home we came as children come form schoole, As gladde, as fishe which were but lately catcht, And straight againe were cast into the poole: For by my fay I coumpt him but a foole, Which would not rather poorely live at large, Than rest in pryson fedde with costly charge. 172 Now have I tolde a tedious tale in rime, Of my mishappes, and what ill lucke I had, Yet some may say, that all to lowde I chime, Since that in warres my fortune was not badde, And many a man in pryson would be gladde, To fare no worse, and lodge no worse than wee, And eke at last to scape and go so free. 173 I must confesse that both we were well used, And promise kept according to contract, And that nor wee, nor Souldiours were abused, No rigour shewed, nor lovely dealing lackt: I must confesse that we were never rackt, Nor forst to do, nor speake agaynst our will, And yet I coumpt it froward fortune still. 174 A truth it is (since warres are ledde by chaunce, And none so stoute but that sometimes may fall,) No man on earth his honour might advaunce, To render better (if he once were thrall) Why who could wishe more comforte at his call, Than for to yeeld with ensigne full displayde, And all armes borne in warlike wise for ayde? 175 Or who could wishe dispatche with greater speede, Than souldiours had which taried so few dayes? Or who could wishe, more succour at his neede, Than used was to them at all assayes? Bread, meate, and drinke, yea wagons in their wayes, To ease the sicke and hurte which could not go, All tane in warres, are seldome used so. 176 Or who could wishe (to ease his captive dayes) More libertie than on his fayth to rest? To eate and drinke at Barons borde alwayes, To lie on downe, to banquet with the best, To have all things, at every just request, To borowe coyne, when any seemde to lacke, To have his owne, away with him to packe? 177 All this and more I must confesse we had, God save (say I) our noble Queene therfore, Hinc illæ lachrimæ, there laye the padde, Which made the strawe suspected be the more, For trust me true, they coveted full sore, To keepe our Queene and countrie fast their friendes, Till all their warres might grow to luckie endes. 178 But were that once to happy ende ybrought, And all stray sheepe come home agayne to folde, Then looke to dore: and thinke the cat is nought, Although she let the mouse from out hir holde: Beleve me now, me thinkes I dare be bolde, To thinke that if they once were freendes againe, We might soone sell, all freendship found in Spaine. 179 Well these are woordes and farre bey?d my reach, Yet by the way receyve them well in worth, And by the way, let never Licques appeach My rayling penne, for thoughe my minde abhorrth, All Spainish prankes: yet must I thunder forth His worthy prayse, who held his fayth unstayned, And evermore to us a freend remayned. 180 Why sayed I then, that warre is full of woes? Or sowre of taste, to them that know it best? Who so demaundes, I will my minde disclose, And then judge you the burdens of my brest: Marke well my wordes and you shall finde him blest, That medleth least with warres in any wise, But quiet lives, and all debate defies. 181 For though we did with truth and honour yeeld, Yet yeelding is alwayes a great disgrace, And though we made a brave retyre in field, Yet who retyres, doth alwayes yeeld his place: And though we never did our selves embase, But were alwayes at Barons table fedde, Yet better were at home with Barlie breade. 182 I leave to tell what losse we did sustaine, In pens, in pay, in wares, and readie wealth, Since all such trash may gotten be againe, Or wasted well at home by privie stelth: Small losse hath he which all his living selth, To save his life, when other helpe is none, Cast up the saddle when the horse is gone. 183 But what I sayde, I say and sweare againe, For first we were in Hollande sore suspect, The states did thinke, that with some filthie gaine The Spainish peeres us Captaines had infect, They thought we ment our ensignes to erect In Kings behalfe: and eke the common sorte, Thought privy pay had made us leave our forte. 184 Againe, the Kings men (onely Licques except, And good A coronell of the kings side. Verdugo) thought we were too well, And that we were but playde with in respect, When as their men in great distresse did dwell: So that with hate their burning hartes did swell, And bad hang up or drowne us everychone, These bones we had alway to byte upon. 185 This sause we had unto our costly fare, And every day we threatned were in deede, So that on both sides we must byde the care, And be mistrust of every wicked deede, And be revilde, and must our selves yet feede With lingring Hope, to get away at last, That selfe same Hope whiche tyed us there so fast. 186 To make up all, our owne men playde their parte, And rang a peale to make us more mystrust, For when they should away from us departe, And sawe us byde, they thought we stayed for lust, And sent them so in secrete to be trust: They thought and sayde, thus have our Captaines solde Us silly soules, for groates and glistring golde. 187 Yea, when they were to England safely brought, Yet talkte they still even as they did before: For slaundrous tongues, if once they tattle ought, With mickell payne will chaunge their wicked lore: It hath bene proved full many dayes of yore, That he which once in slander takes delight, Will seldome frame his woordes to sounde aright. 188 Straunge tale to tell, we that had set them free, And set ourselves on sandes for their expence, We that remaynd in daunger of the tree, When they were safe, we that were their defence, With armes, with cost, with deedes, with eloquence: We that saved such, as knew not where to flie, Were now by them accusde of trecherie. 189 These fruits (I say) in wicked warres I founde, Which make me wryte much more than else I would, For losse of life, or dread of deadly wounde, Shall never make me blame it though I could, Since death doth dwell on everie kinde of mould: And who in warre hath caught a fatall clappe, Might chaunce at home to have no better happe. 190 So losse of goodes shall never trouble me, Since God which gives can take when pleaseth him, But losse of fame or slaundred so to be, That makes my wittes to breake above their brimme, And frettes my harte, and lames me every limme: For Noble minds their honour more esteeme, Than worldly wights, or wealth, or life can deeme. 191 And yet in warres, such graffes of grudge do growe, Such lewdnesse lurkes, such malice makes mischief, Such envie boyles, such falshood fire doth blowe, That Bountie burnes, and truth is called thief, And good desertes are brought into such brief, That Saunder snuffe which sweares the matter out, Brings oftentimes the noblest names in doubt. 192 Then whether I be one of Haughty harte, Or Greedy minde, or Miser in decay, I sayde and say that for mine owne poore parte, I may confesse that Bellum every way, Is Sweete: but how? (beare well my woordes away) Forsooth, to such as never did it trie, This is my Theame I cannot chaunge it I. Peroratio. 193 O noble Queene, whose high foresight provides, That wast of warre, your realmes doth not destroye, Prince. But pleasaunt peace, and quiet concord glydes, In every coast, to drive out darke anoye, O vertuous dame, I say Pardonez moy, That I presume in worthlesse verse to warne, Thambitious Prince, his dueties to descerne. 194 Your skilfull minde (O Queene without compare) Can soone conceyve that cause constraynes me so, Since wicked warres have bredde such cruell care, In Flaunders, Fraunce, in Spaine and many mo, Which reape thereby none other worth but wo: Whiles you (meane while) enjoy the fruites of peace, Still praysing God, whose bounties never cease. 195 If you (my liege) vouchsafe in gratious wise, To pardon that which passeth from my Muse, Then care I not what other kings devise, In warres defense: nor though they me accuse, And say that I their bloudie deedes abuse: Your onely grace my soveraigne Lady be, Let other Kings thinke what they list of me. 196 And you my Lordes to whome I dueties owe, And beare such love as best becommeth me, Nobilitie.First Earle of Bedford, whome I right well know, To honour armes: and woorthie Warwyke he, In whose good grace I covet sore to be: Then Leyster next, (Sussex not set behinde) And worthy Essex men of noble minde. 197 Yong Oxenford as toward as the best, Northumberland, and Ormount woorthy prayse, Lyncolne, Kildare, and Worster with the rest Of noble Earles, which hold your happy dayes In high renowme, as men of warre alwayes: With others mo to many to recite, Vouchsafe my Lordes to pardone that I write. 198 Of Wilton Grey (to whome these rimes I wrote) With all the Barons bold of English soyle, I humbly crave that it may be forgotte, Although my Muze have seemde to keepe a coyle With mighty men which put the weake to foyle: I ment not you since, by your deedes appeares, You rule with right, like wise and worthy peares. 199 Prelacie.Right reverend, of Canterbury chiefe, London, and Lincoln, Bishoppes by your name, Good Deane of Pawles (which lend a great relief, To naked neede) and all the rest of fame, In pastors place: with whome I were too blame, If Nevynsone my maister were not plaste, Since by his helpe I learning first embraste. 200 Beare with my verse, and thinke I ment not you, Whereas I spake of pride in Prelacie, But let it bide even there where first it grew, Till God vouchsafe to quench hipocrisie, Which by pretence to punish heresie, Doth conquere realmes, and common concords breake, You know my mind, I neede no playner speake. 201 You gemmes of Justice, chiefe of either bench, And he that keepes hir Majesties great seale, Good Queenes attorney, he whose pitties quench Lawyers. (I say sometimes) the rigour of his zeale, When miserie, to mercy must apeale, And Sergeant Lovelace, many ways my friend, As I have found (yet let me there not end,) [202] But hold my tale to Rugge and all the rest Of good Grayes Inne, where honest Yelverton, And I Per se sometimes yfeere did rest, When amitie first in our brests begonne, Which shall endure as long as any Sunne May shine on earth, or water swimme in Seas, Let not my verse your lawlike minds displease, 203 For well wot you, our master Christ himselfe, Which had but twelve Apostles in his trayne, Had Judas yet, which solde for worldly pelfe Our Saviour: this text is true and playne: And where so many Lawyers do remayne, There may be some although that you be none, Which breede debate and love to cast a bone. 204 In Chancerie I neede no man suspect, Since conscience, in that court beareth sway, Yet in the same I may no wayes neglect, Nor worthy Powle, nor Cordell by the way, Of whome that one, is of my keepe the keye, That other once did lende me such advise, As was both sounde and good, had I bene wise. 205 He tolde me once, (I beare it well in minde, And shall it nay forget whyles lyfe doth last) That harde it is a noble name to finde, In such attempts as then in service past: Beleve me now I founde his wordes no blast, Wherfore I pray both him and his compeere, To beare with that which I have written heere. 206 And as for Merchants, though I finde the most Hard harted men and compting cunningly, Yet Albany shall thinke I do not boast Merchaunts.In rayling wise: for sure his curtesie, Constreynes me now to prayse him worthely. And gentle Rowe with Luntley make me say, That many Merchaunts beare even what they may. 207 But to conclude, I meane no more but thus, In all estates some one may treade awrye, And he that list my verses to discusse, Shall see I ment no more, but modestly To warne the wise, that they such faults do flie As put downe peace by covine or debate, Since warre and strife bryng wo to every state. FINIS. L'envoié. Go little Booke, God graunt thou none offende, For so meant hee which sought to set thee foorth, And when thou commest where Soldiers seeme to wend, Submit thy selfe as writte but little woorth: Confesse withall, that thou hast bene too bolde, To speake so plaine of Haughtie hartes in place, And say that he which wrote thee coulde have tolde Full many a tale, of blouds that were not base: He coulde have writte Dan Dudleyes noble deedes, Whose like hath since bene harde on earth to finde, Although his Vertue shewes it selfe in Seedes, Which treade his tracks, and come not farre behinde. He might have sung of Grey the woorthie prayse, Whose ofspring holdes the honor of his sire: He coulde declare what Wallop was alwayes, What Awdelie seemde, what Randell did require. He coulde say what desertes in Drewrie be, In Reade, in Bryckwell, and a meany moe: But bashfulnesse did make him blush, least he Should but eclypse their fames by singing so. Suffiseth this, that still he honors those Which wade in warres to get a woorthie name, And least esteemes the greedie snudge, which goes To gayne good golde, witho[u]t respecte of fame. And for the thirde sorte, those that in dystresse Do drive their dayes, till drummes do draw them out, He coumpts him selfe to bee nor more nor lesse, But even the same: for sure withouten doubt, If drummes once sounde a lustie martch in deede, Then farewell bookes, for he will trudge with speede.Corected, perfected, and finished. FINIS. Tam Marti quàm Mercurio. HEARBES. The Frute of reconciliation, Written uppon a reconciliation betwene two freendes. The hatefull man that heapeth in his mynde, Cruell revenge of wronges forepast and done, May not (with ease) y? pleasaunt pathway finde, Of friendly verse which I have now begone, Unlesse at first his angry brest untwinde, The crooked knot which canckred choller knit, And then recule with reconciled grace. Likewise I finde it sayde in holy write, If thou entend to turne thy fearefull face, To God above: make thyne agreement yet, First with thy Brother whom thou didst abuse, Confesse thy faultes, thy frowardnesse and all, So that the Lord thy prayer not refuse. When I consider this, and then the brall, Which raging youth (I will not me excuse) Did whilome breede in mine unmellowed brayne, I thought it meete before I did assay, To write in ryme the double golden gayne, Of amitie: first yet to take away The grutch of grief, as thou doest me constrayne, By due desert whereto I now must yeeld, And drowne for aye in depth of Lethes lake, Disdaynefull moodes whom frendship cannot weelde: Pleading for peace which for my parte I make Of former strife, and henceforth let us write The pleasant fruites of faythfull friends delight. Si fortunatus infœlix. [This vaine availe which thou by Mars hast woonne] Two gentlemen did run three courses at the Ring for one kisse to be tak? of a fair gentlewoman being then present, with this condicion, that the winner should have the kisse, and the loser be bound to write some verses upon the gaine or losse therof. Now it fortuned that the winner triumphed, saying, he much lamented that in youth he had not seen the warres. Whereupon the loser compyled these following, in discharge of the condition above rehearsed. This vaine availe which thou by Mars hast woonne, Should not allure thy flitting minde to feelde, Where sturdie steeds in depth of dangers roonne, By guttes wel gnawen by clappes that Canons yeelde. Where faithlesse friendes by warrefare waxen ware, And runne to him that giveth best rewarde: No feare of lawes can cause them for to care, But robbe and reave, and steale without regarde, The fathers coate, the brothers steede from stall: The deare friendes purse shall picked be for pence, The native soile, the parentes left and all, With Tant tra tant, the Campe is marching hence. But when bare beggrie bidds them to beware, And late repentance rules them to retire, Like hivelesse Bees they wander here and there, And hang on them who (earst) did dreade their ire. This cut throte life (me seemes) thou shouldst not like, And shunne the happie haven of meane estate: High Jove (perdy) may sende what thou doest seeke, And heape up poundes within thy quiet gate. Nor yet I would that thou shouldst spende thy dayes In idlenesse to teare a golden time: Like countrey loutes, which compt none other praise, But grease a sheepe, and learne to serve the swine. In vaine were then the giftes which nature lent, If Pan so presse to passe dame Pallas lore: But my good friende, let thus thy youth be spent, Serve God thy Lord, and prayse him evermore. Search out the skill which learned bookes do teach, And serve in feeld when shadowes make thee sure: Hold with the head, and row not past thy reach. But plead for peace which plenty may procure. And (for my life) if thou canst run this race, Thy bagges of coyne will multiply apace. Si fortunatus infœlix. [The feeble thred which Lachesis hath spoone] Not long after the writing hereof: he departed from the company of his sayd friend (whom he entirely loved) into the west of Englande, and feeling himselfe so consumed by womens craft that he doubted of a safe returne: wrote before his departure as followeth. The feeble thred which Lachesis hath spoone, To drawe my dayes in short abode with thee, Hath wrought a webbe which now (welneare) is donne, The wale is worne: and (all to late) I see That lingring life doth dally but in vaine, For Atropos will cut the twist in twaine. I not discerne what life but lothsome were, When faithfull friends are kept in twayne by want: Nor yet perceive what pleasure doth appeere, To deepe desires where good successe is skant. Such spight yet showes dame fortune (if she frowne,) The haughty harts in high mishaps to drowne. Hot be the flames which boyle in friendly mindes, Cruell the care and dreadfull is the doome: Slipper the knot which tract of time untwynds, Hatefull the life and welcome were the toome. Blest were the day which might devoure such youth, And curst the want that seekes to choke such trueth. This wayling verse I bathe in flowing teares, And would my life might end with these my lines: Yet strive I not to force into thine eares, Such fayned plaints as fickell faith resignes. But high forsight in dreames hath stopt my breath, And causde the Swanne to sing before his death. For lo these naked walles do well declare, My latest leave of thee I taken have: And unknowne coastes which I must seeke with care Do well divine that there shalbe my grave: There shall my death make many for to mone, Skarce knowne to them, well knowne to thee alone. This bowne of thee (as last request) I crave, When true report shall sounde my death with fame: Vouchsafe yet then to go unto my grave, And there first write my byrth and then my name: And how my life was shortned many yeares, By womens wyles as to the world appeares. And in reward of graunt to this request, Permit O God my toung these woordes to tell: (When as his pen shall write upon my chest) With shriking voyce mine owne deare friend farewell: No care on earth did seeme so much to me, As when my corps was forst to part from thee. Si fortunatus infœlix. He wrote to the same friend from Excester, this Sonet following. A hundreth sonnes (in course but not in kind) Can witnesse well that I possesse no joye: The feare of death which fretteth in my mind Consumes my hart with dread of darke anoye. And for eche sonne a thousand broken sleepes Devide my dreames with fresh recourse of cares: The youngest sister sharpe hir sheare she keepes, To cut my thred, and thus my life it weares. Yet let such daies, such thousand restlesse nights, Spit forth their spite, let fates eke showe their force: Deathes daunting dart where so his buffet lights, Shall shape no change within my friendly corse: But dead or live, in heaven, in earth, in hell I wilbe thine where so my carkase dwell. Si fortunatus infœlix. He wrote to the same friend from Founteine belle eaü in Fraunce, this Sonnet in commendation of the said house of Fountaine bel'eaü. Not stately Troye though Priam yet did live, Could now compare Founteine bel'eaü to passe: Nor Syrian towers, whose loftie steppes did strive, To climbe the throne where angry Saturne was, For outward shew the ports are of such price, As skorne the cost which Cesar spilt in Rome: Such works within as stayne the rare devise, Which whilome he Apelles wrought on toome. Swift Tiber floud which fed the Romayne pooles, Puddle to this where Christall melts in streames, The pleasaunt place where Muses kept their schooles, (Not parcht with Phœbe, nor banisht from his beames) Yeeld to those Dames, nor sight, nor fruite, nor smell, Which may be thought these gardens to excell. Si fortunatus infœlix. He wrote unto a Skotish Dame whom he chose for his Mistresse in the French Court, as followeth. Lady receyve, receive in gracious wise, This ragged verse, these rude ill skribled lines: Too base an object for your heavenly eyes, For he that writes his freedome (lo) resignes Into your handes: and freely yeelds as thrall His sturdy necke (earst subject to no yoke) But bending now, and headlong prest to fall, Before your feete, such force hath beauties stroke. Since then mine eyes (which skornd our English dames) In forrayne courtes have chosen you for fayre, Let be this verse true token of my flames, And do not drench your owne in deepe dispayre. Onely I crave (as I nill change for new) That you vouchsafe to thinke your servaunt trew. Si fortunatus infœlix. A Sonet written in prayse of the browne beautie, compiled for the love of Mistresse E. P. as foloweth. The thriftles thred which pampred beauty spinnes, In thraldom binds the foolish gazing eyes: As cruell Spiders with their crafty ginnes, In worthlesse webbes doe snare the simple Flies. The garments gay, the glittring golden gite, The tysing talk which flowes from Pallas pooles: The painted pale, the (too much) red made white, Are smiling baytes to fishe for loving fooles. But lo, when eld in toothlesse mouth appeares, And hoary heares in steede of beauties blaze: Then had I wist, doth teach repenting yeares, The tickle track of craftie Cupides maze. Twixt faire and foule therfore, twixt great and small, A lovely nutbrowne face is best of all. Si fortunatus infœlix. Now to begin with another man, take these verses written to be sent with a ryng, wherein were engraved a Partrich in a Merlines foote. The Partridge in the pretie Merlines foote, Who feeles hir force supprest with fearfulnesse, And findes that strength nor strife can do hir boote, To scape the danger of hir deepe distresse: These wofull wordes may seeme for to reherse Which I must write in this waymenting verse. What helpeth now (sayeth she) dame natures skill, To die my feathers like the dustie ground? Or what prevayles to lend me winges at will Which in the ayre can make my bodie bound? Since from the earth the dogges me drave perforce, And now aloft the Hauke hath caught my corse. If chaunge of colours, could not me convey, Yet mought my wings have scapt the dogges despite: And if my wings did fayle to flie away, Yet mought my strength resist the Merlines might. But nature made the Merline mee to kill, And me to yeeld unto the Merlines will. My lot is like (deere Dame) beleve me well, The quiet life which I full closely kept, Was not content in happie state to dwell, But forth in hast to gaze on thee it lept. Desire thy dogge did spring me up in hast, Thou wert the Hauke, whose tallents caught me fast. What should I then, seeke meanes to flie away? Or strive by force, to breake out of thy feete? No, no, perdie, I may no strength assay, To strive with thee ywis, it were not meete. Thou art that Hauke, whom nature made to hent me, And I the Byrd, that must therewith content me. And since Dame nature hath ordayned so, Hir happie hest I gladly shall embrace: I yeeld my will, although it were to wo, I stand content to take my griefe for grace: And seale it up within my secrete hart, Which seale receive, as token of my smart. Spræta tamen vivunt. A loving Lady being wounded in the spring time, and now galded eftsones with the remembrance of the spring, doth therfore thus bewayle. This tenth of March when Aries receyvd, Dame Phœbus rayes, into his horned head: And I my selfe, by learned lore perceyv'd, That Ver approcht, and frostie winter fled: I crost the Thames, to take the cherefull ayre, In open feeldes, the weather was so fayre. And as I rowed, fast by the further shore, I heard a voyce, which seemed to lament: Whereat I stay'd, and by a stately dore, I left my Boate, and up on land I went: Till at the last by lasting paine I found, The wofull wight, which made this dolefull sound. In pleasant garden (placed all alone) I sawe a Dame, who sat in weary wise, With scalding sighes, she uttred all hir mone, The ruefull teares, downe rayned from hir eyes: Hir lowring head, full lowe on hand she layde, On knee hir arme: and thus this Lady sayde. Alas (quod she) behold eche pleasaunt greene, Will now renew his sommers livery, The fragrant flowers, which have not long bene seene, Will florish now, (ere long) in bravery: The tender buddes, whom colde hath long kept in, Will spring and sproute, as they do now begin. But I (alas) within whose mourning minde, The graffes of grief, are onely given to growe, Cannot enjoy the spring which others finde, But still my will, must wither all in woe: The cold of care, so nippes my joyes at roote, No sunne doth shine, that well can do them boote. The lustie Ver, which whilome might exchange My griefe to joy, and then my joyes encrease, Springs now elsewhere, and showes to me but strange, My winters woe, therefore can never cease: In other coasts, his sunne full cleare doth shine, And comforts lends to ev'ry mould but mine. What plant can spring, that feeles no force of Ver? What floure can florish, where no sunne doth shine? These Bales (quod she) within my breast I beare, To breake my barke, and make my pith to pine: Needes must I fall, I fade both roote and rinde, My braunches bowe at blast of ev'ry winde. This sayde: shee cast a glance and spied my face, By sight whereof, Lord how she chaunged hew? So that for shame, I turned backe apace And to my home, my selfe in hast I drew: And as I could hir wofull wordes reherse, I set them downe in this waymenting verse. Now Ladies you, that know by whom I sing, And feele the winter, of such frozen wills: Of curtesie, yet cause this noble spring, To send his sunne, above the highest hilles: And so to shyne, uppon hir fading sprayes, Which now in woe, do wyther thus alwayes. Spræta tamen vivunt. An absent Dame thus complayneth. Much like the seely Byrd, which close in Cage is pent, So sing I now, not notes of joye, but layes of deep lament. And as the hooded Hauke, which heares the Partrich spring, Who though she feele hir self fast tied, yet beats her bating wing: So strive I now to shewe, my feeble forward will, Although I know my labour lost, to hop against the Hill. The droppes of darke disdayne, did never drench my hart, For well I know I am belov'd, if that might ease my smart. Ne yet the privy coales, of glowing jellosie, Could ever kindle needlesse feare, within my fantasie. The rigor of repulse, doth not renew my playnt, Nor choyce of change doth move my mone, nor force me thus to faint. Onely that pang of payne, which passeth all the rest, And cankerlike doth fret the hart, within the giltlesse brest. Which is if any bee, most like the panges of death, That present grief now gripeth me, and strives to stop my breath. When friendes in mind may meete, and hart in hart embrace, And absent yet are faine to playne, for lacke of time and place: Then may I compt their love, like seede that soone is sowen, Yet lacking droppes of heav?ly dew, with weedes is overgrow?. The Greyhound is agreev'd, although he see his game, If stil in slippe he must be stayde, when he would chase the same. So fares it now by me, who know my selfe belov'd Of one the best, in eche respect, that ever yet was prov'd. But since my lucklesse lot, forbids me now to taste, The dulcet fruites of my delight, therfore in woes I wast. And Swallow like I sing, as one enforced so, Since others reape the gaineful crop, which I with pain did sow. Yet you that marke my song, excuse my Swallowes voyce, And beare with hir unpleasant tunes, which cannot wel rejoyce. Had I or lucke in love, or lease of libertie, Then should you heare some sweeter notes, so cleere my throte would be. But take it thus in gree, and marke my playnsong well, No hart feeles so much hurt, as that, which doth in absence dwell. Spræta tamen vivunt. In prayse of a Countesse. Desire of Fame would force my feeble skill, To prayse a Countesse by hir dew desert: But dread of blame holds backe my forward will, And quencht the coales which kindled in my hart. Thus am I plongd twene dread and deepe desire, To pay the dew which dutie doth require. And when I call the mighty Gods in ayd To further forth some fine invention: My bashefull spirits be full ill afrayd To purchase payne by my presumption. Such malice reignes (sometimes) in heavenly minds, To punish him that prayseth as he finds. For Pallas first, whose filed flowing skill, Should guyde my pen some pleasant words to write, With angry mood hath fram'd a froward will, To dashe devise as oft as I endite. For why? if once my Ladies gifts were knowne, Pallas should loose the prayses of hir owne. And bloudy Mars by chaunge of his delight Hath made Joves daughter now mine enemie: In whose conceipt my Countesse shines so bright, That Venus pines for burning jelousie: She may go home to Vulcane now agayne, For Mars is sworne to be my Ladies swayne. Of hir bright beames Dan Phœbus stands in dread, And shames to shine within our Horizon: Dame Cynthia holds in hir horned head, For feare to loose by like comparison: Lo thus shee lives, and laughes them all to skorne, Countesse on earth, in heaven a Goddesse borne. And I sometimes hir servaunt, now hir friend, Whom heaven and earth for his (thus) hate and blame: Have yet presumde in friendly wise to spend, This ragged verse, in honor of hir name; A simple gift compared by the skill, Yet what may seeme so deere as such good will. Meritum petere, grave. The Lover declareth his affection, togither with the cause thereof. When first I thee beheld in colours black and white, Thy face in forme wel framde w? favor blooming stil: My burning brest in cares did choose his chief delight, With pen to painte thy prayse, contrary to my skill: Whose worthinesse compar'd with this my rude devise, I blush and am abasht, this worke to enterprise. But when I call to mind thy sundry gifts of grace, Full fraught with maners meeke in happy quiet mind: My hasty hand forthwith doth scribble on apace, Least willing hart might thinke, it ment to come behind: Thus do both hand and hart these carefull meetres use, Twixt hope and trembling feare, my duetie to excuse. Wherfore accept these lines, and banish darke disdayne, Be sure they come from one that loveth thee in chief: And guerdon me thy friend in like with love agayne, So shalt thou well be sure to yeeld me such relief, As onely may redresse my sorrowes and my smart: For proofe whereof I pledge (deare Dame) to thee my hart. Meritum petere, grave. A Lady being both wronged by false suspect, and also wounded by the durance of hir husband, doth thus bewray hir grief. Give me my Lute in bed now as I lie, And lock the doores of mine unluckie bower: So shall my voyce in mournefull verse discrie The secrete smart which causeth me to lower: Resound you walles an Eccho to my mone, And thou cold bed wherein I lie alone, Beare witnesse yet what rest thy Lady takes, When other sleepe which may enjoy their makes. In prime of youth when Cupide kindled fire, And warmd my will with flames of fervent love: To further forth the fruite of my desire, My freends devisde this meane for my behove. They made a match according to my mind, And cast a snare my fansie for to blind: Short tale to make: the deede was almost donne, Before I knew which way the worke begonne. And with this lot I did my selfe content, I lent a liking to my parents choyse: With hand and hart I gave my free consent, And hung in hope for ever to rejoyce. I liv'd and lov'd long time in greater joy, Than shee which held king Priams sonne of Troy: But three lewd lots have chang'd my heaven to hell And those be these, give eare and marke them well. First slaunder he, which alwayes beareth hate, To happy harts in heavenly state that bide: Gan play his part to stirre up some debate, Whereby suspect into my choyse might glide. And by his meanes the slime of false suspect, Did (as I feare) my dearest friend infect. Thus by these twayn long was I plungd in paine, Yet in good hope my hart did still remaine. But now (aye me) the greatest grief of all, (Sound loud my Lute, and tell it out my toong) The hardest hap that ever might befall, The onely cause wherfore this song is soong, Is this alas: my love, my Lord, my Roy, My chosen pheare, my gemme, and all my joye, Is kept perforce out of my dayly sight, Whereby I lacke the stay of my delight. In loftie walles, in strong and stately towers, (With troubled minde in solitary sorte,) My lovely Lord doth spend his dayes and howers, A weary life devoyde of all disport. And I poore soule must lie here all alone, To tyre my trueth, and wound my will with mone: Such is my hap to shake my blooming time, With winters blastes before it passe the prime. Now have you heard the summe of all my grief, Whereof to tell my hart (oh) rends in twayne: Good Ladies yet lend you me some relief, And beare a parte to ease me of my payne. My sortes are such, that waying well my trueth, They might provoke the craggy rocks to rueth, And move these walles with teares for to lament, The lothsome life wherein my youth is spent. But thou my Lute, be still, now take thy rest, Repose thy bones uppon this bed of downe: Thou hast dischargd some burden from my brest, Wherefore take thou my place, here lie thee downe. And let me walke to tyre my restlesse minde, Untill I may entreate some curteous winde To blow these wordes unto my noble make, That he may see I sorow for his sake. Meritum petere, grave. A Riddle. A lady once did aske of me, This preatie thing in privitie: Good sir (quod she) faine would I crave, One thing which you your selfe not have: Nor never had yet in times past, Nor never shall while life doth last. And if you seeke to find it out, You loose your labour out of doubt: Yet if you love me as you say, Then give it me, for sure you may. Meritum petere, grave. The shield of Love. &amp;c. L'escü d'amour, the shield of perfect love, The shield of love, the force of stedfast faith, The force of faith which never will remove, But standeth fast, to bide the brunts of death: That trustie targe, hath long borne off the blowes, And broke the thrusts, which absence at me throwes. In dolefull dayes I lead an absent life, And wound my will with many a weary thought: I plead for peace, yet sterve in stormes of strife, I find debate, where quiet rest was sought. These panges with mo, unto my paine I prove, Yet beare I all uppon my shield of love. In colder cares are my conceipts consumd, Than Dido felt when false Æneas fled: In farre more heat, than trusty Troylus fumde, When craftie Cressyde dwelt with Diomed: My hope such frost, my hot desire such flame, That I both fryse, and smoulder in the same. So that I live, and die in one degree, Healed by hope, and hurt againe with dread: Fast bound by faith when fansie would be free, Untied by trust, though thoughts enthrall my head: Reviv'd by joyes, when hope doth most abound, And yet with grief, in depth of dolors drownd. In these assaultes I feele my feebled force Begins to faint, thus weried still in woes: And scarcely can my thus consumed corse, Hold up this Buckler to beare of these blowes: So that I crave, or presence for relief, Or some supplie, to ease mine absent grief. Lenvoie. To you (deare Dame) this dolefull plaint I make, Whose onely sight may soone redresse my smart: Then shew your selfe, and for your servaunts sake, Make hast post hast, to helpe a faithfull harte: Mine owne poore shield hath me defended long, Now lend me yours, for elles you do me wrong. Meritum petere, grave. Councell to Duglasse Dive written upon this occasion. She had a booke wherein she had collected sundry good ditties of divers mens doings, in whiche booke she would needes entreate the aucthor to write some verses. And thereupon he wrote as followeth. To binde a bushe of thornes amongst sweete smelling floures, May make the posie seeme the worse, and yet the fault is ours: For throw away the thorne, and marke what will ensew? The posie then will shew it selfe, sweete, faire, and freshe of hew. A puttocke set on pearch, fast by a falcons side, Will quickly shew it selfe a kight, as time hath often tride. And in my musing minde, I feare to finde like fall, As just reward to recompence my rash attempts withall. Thou bidst, and I must bowe, thou wilt that I shall write, Thou canst commaund my wery muse some verses to endite. And yet perdie, thy booke is fraught with learned verse, Such skill as in my musing minde I can none like reherse. What followes then for me? but if I must needes write, To set downe by the falcons side, my selfe a sillie kight. And yet the sillie kight, well weyde in each degree, May serve sometimes (as in his kinde) for mans commoditie. The kight can weede the worme, from corne and costly seedes, The kight c? kill the mowldiwarpe, in pleasant meads y? breeds: Out of the stately streetes, the kight can clense the filth, As m? can cl?se the worthlesse weedes, fr? fruteful fallowed tilth. And onely set aside the hennes poore progenie, I cannot see who can accuse the kight for fellonie. The falcon, she must feede on partritch, and on quayle, On pigeon, plover, ducke &amp; drake, hearne, lapwing, teale, &amp; raile, Hir hungrie throte devours both foode and deintie fare, Whereby I take occasion, thus boldly to compare. And as a sillie kight, (not falcon like that flie, Nor yet presume to hover by mount Hellycon The Hill where poetes fayne that the Muses sleepe. on hie) I frendly yet presume, upon my frends request, In barreine verse to shew my skill, then take it for the best. And Douty Douglasse thou, that art of faulcons kinde, Give willing eare yet to the kight, and beare his words in minde. Serve thou first God thy Lord, and prayse him evermore, Obey thy Prince and love thy make, by him set greatest store. Thy Parents follow next, for honor and for awe, Thy frends use alwaies faithfully, for so commands the lawe. Thy seemely selfe at last, thou shalte likewise regard, And of thy selfe this lesson learne, and take it as reward: That looke how farre deserts, may seeme in thee to shine, So farre thou maist set out thy selfe, without empeach or crime. For this I dare avow, without selfe love (alight) It can scarce be that vertue dwell, in any earthly wight. But if in such selfe love, thou seeme to wade so farre, As fall to foule presumption, and judge thy selfe a starre, Beware betimes and thinke in our A true exposition. Etymologie, Such faults are plainly called pryde, and in french Over-weening. Surcüydrye, Lo thus can I pore kight, adventure for to teach The falcon flie, and yet forewarne, she row not past hir reach. Thus can I weede the worme, which seeketh to devoure The seeds of vertue, which might grow within thee every houre. Thus can I kill the mowle, which else would overthrow The good foundacion of thy fame, with every litle blowe. And thus can I convey, out of thy comely brest, The sluttish heapes of peevish pride, which might defile the rest. Perchance some falcons flie, which will not greatly grutch, To learne thee first to love thy selfe, and then to love to mutch, But I am none of those, I list not so to range, I have m?s meate enough at home, what need I th? seeke change. I am no peacocke I: my feathers be not gay, And though they were, I see my feete such fonde affectes to stay, I list not set to sale a thing so litle worth, I rather could kepe close my creast, than seeke to set it forth. Wherefore if in this verse, which thou commandst to flowe, Thou chaunce to fall on construing, whereby some doubtes may grow, Yet grant this onely boone, peruse it twice or thrice, Disgest it well ere thou condemne the depth of my devise. And use it like the nut, first cracke the outward shell, Then trie the kirnell by the tast, and it may please thee well. Do not as barbers do, which wash beards curiously, Then cut them off, then cast them out, in open streetes to lie. Remember therewithall, my muze is tied in chaines, The goonshot of calamitie hath battred all my braynes. And though this verse scape out, take thou thereat no marke, It is but like a hedlesse flie, that tumbleth in the darke. It was thine owne request, remember so it was, Wherefore if thou dislike the same, then licence it to passe Into my brest againe, from whence it flew in hast, Full like a kight which not deserves by falcons to be plast: And like a stubbed thorne, which may not seeme to serve, To st?d with such sweete smelling floures, like praises to deserve. Yet take this harmelesse thorne, to picke thy teeth withall, A tooth picke serves some use perdie, although it be but small. And when thy teeth therewith, be piked faire and cleane, Then bend thy tong no worse to me, than mine to thee hath bene. Ever or Never. Councell given to master Bartholmew Withipoll a little before his latter journey to Geane. 1572. Mine owne good Bat, before thou hoyse up saile, To make a furrowe in the foming seas, Content thy selfe to heare for thine availe, Such harmelesse words, as ought thee not displease. First in thy journey, jape not over much, What? laughest thou Batte, bicause I write so plaine? Beleeve me now it is a friendly touch, To use fewe words where friendship doth remaine. And for I finde, that fault hath runne to fast, Both in thy flesh, and fancie too sometime, Me thinks plaine dealing biddeth me to cast This bone at first amid my dogrell rime. But shall I say, to give thee grave advise? (Which in my head is (God he knowes) full geazon)? Then marke me well, and though I be not wise, Yet in my rime, thou maist perhaps find reason. First every day, beseech thy God on knee, So to direct thy staggring steppes alway, That he which every secrete thought doth see May holde thee in, when thou wouldst goe astray: And that he deigne to sende thee safe retoure, And quicke dispatche of that whiche is thy due: Lette this (my Batte) be bothe thy prime and houre, Wherin also commend to Nostre Dieu, Thy good Companion and my verie frend, To whom I shoulde (but time woulde not permitte) Have taken paine some ragged ryme to sende In trustie token, that I not forget His curtesie: but this is debte to thee, I promysde it, and now I meane to pay: What was I saying? sirra, will you see How soone my wittes were wandering astraye? I saye, praye thou for thee and for thy mate, So shipmen sing, and though the note be playne, Yet sure the musike is in heavenly state, When frends sing so, and know not how to fayne. The nexte to GOD, thy Prince have still in mynde Thy countreys honor, and the common wealth: And flee from them, which fled with every wynde There are to many of them in every countrey. From native soyle, to forraine coastes by stealth: Theyr traynes are trustlesse, tending still to treason, Theyr smoothed tongues are lyned all with guyle, Their power slender, scarsly woorthe two peason, Their malice much, their wittes are full of wyle: Eschue them then, and when thou seest them, say, Da, da, sir K, I may not come at you, You cast a snare your countrey to betraye, And woulde you have me trust you now for true? Remembre Batte the foolish blink eyed boye Which was at Rome, thou knowest whome I meane, A Misterie. Remember eke the preatie beardlesse toye, Whereby thou foundst a safe returne to Geane, Doe so againe: (God shielde thou shouldst have neede,) But rather so, than to forsweare thy selfe: A loyall hearte, (beleeve this as thy Creede) Is evermore more woorth than worldly pelfe. And for one lesson, take this more of mee, There are three Ps almost in every place, From whiche I counsell thee alwayes to flee, And take good hede of them in any case, The first is poyson, perillous in deede To such as travayle with a heavie pursse: And thou my Batte beware, for thou hast neede, Thy pursse is lynde with paper, which is wursse: Thy billes of credite wil not they thinkst thou, Be bayte to sette Italyan hands on woorke? Yes by my faye, and never worse than nowe, When every knave hath leysure for to lurke, And knoweth thou commest for the shelles of Christe: Beware therefore where ever that thou go, It may fall out that thou shalte be entiste To suppe sometimes with a Magnifico, And have a Fico foysted in thy dishe, Bycause thou shouldest disgeste thy meate the better: Beware therefore, and rather feede on fishe, Than learne to spell fyne fleshe with such a Letter. Some may present thee with a pounde or twaine Of Spanishe soape to washe thy lynnen white: Beware therefore, and thynke it were small gayne, To save thy shirte, and cast thy skinne off quite: Some cunning man maye teache thee for to ryde, And stuffe thy saddle all with Spanishe wooll, Or in thy stirrops have a toye so tyde, As both thy legges may swell thy buskins full: Beware therfore, and beare a noble porte, Drynke not for thyrste before an other taste: Lette none outlandishe Taylour take disporte To stuffe thy doublet full of such Bumbaste, As it may cast thee in unkindely sweate, And cause thy haire per companie to glyde, Straungers are fyne in many a propre feate: Beware therefore: the seconde P. is Pryde, More perillous than was the first by farre, For that infects but bloud and leaves the bones, This poysons all, and mindes of men doth marre, It findeth nookes to creepe in for the nones: First from the minde it makes the heart to swell, From thence the flesh is pampred every parte, The skinne is taught in Dyers shoppes to dwell, The haire is curlde or frisled up by arte: Beleeve mee Batte, our Countreymen of late Have caughte such knackes abroade in forayne lande, That most men call them Devils incarnate, So singular in theyr conceites they stande: Nowe sir, if I shall see your maistershippe Come home disguysde and cladde in queynt araye, As with a piketoothe byting on your lippe, Your brave Mustachyos turnde the Turky waye, A Coptanckt hatte made on a Flemmish blocke, A nightgowne cloake downe trayling to your toes, A slender sloppe close couched to your docke, A curtold slipper, and a shorte silke hose: Bearing your Rapier pointe above the hilte, And looking bigge like Marquise of all Beefe, Then shall I coumpte your toyle and travayle spilte, Bycause my seconde P, with you is cheefe. But forwardes nowe, although I stayde a while, My hindmost P, is worsse than bothe these two, For it both bones and bodie doth defile, With fouler blots than bothe those other doo. Shorte tale to make, this P, can beare no blockes, (God shielde me Batte, should beare it in his breast) And with a dashe it spelleth piles and pockes A perlous P, and woorsse than bothe the reste: Now though I finde no cause for to suspect My Batte in this, bycause he hath bene tryde, Yet since such Spanish buttons can infect Kings, Emperours, Princes and the world so wide, And since those sunnes do mellowe men so fast As most that travayle come home very ripe Although (by sweate) they learne to live and last When they have daunced after Guydoes pype: Therfore I thought it meete to warne my frende Of this foule P, and so an ende of Ps. Now for thy diet marke my tale to ende, And thanke me then, for that is all my fees. See thou exceede not in three double Us, The first is Wine, which may enflame thy bloud, The second Women, such as haunte the stewes, The thirde is Wilfulnesse, which dooth no good. These three eschue, or temper them alwayes: So shall my Batte prolong his youthful yeeres, And see long George againe, with happie dayes, Who if he bee as faithfull to his feeres, As hee was wonte, will dayly pray for Batte, And for Sir William Morgan of Pencoyde. Pencoyde: and if it fall out so, That James a Parrye doo but make good that, Which he hath sayde: and if he bee (no, no) The best companion that long George can finde, Then at the Spawe I promise for to bee In Auguste nexte, if God turne not my minde, Where as I would bee glad thy selfe to see: Till then farewell, and thus I ende my song, Take it in gree, for else thou doest mee wrong. Haud ictus sapio. Gascoignes woodmanship written to the L. Grey of Wilton upon this occasion the sayd L. Grey delighting (amongst many other good qualities) in chusing of his winter deare, &amp; killing the same with his bowe, did furnishe the Aucthor with a crossebowe cum pertinenciis and vouchsaved to use his company in the said exercise, calling him one of his woodmen. Now the Aucthor shooting very often, could never hitte any deare, yea and oftentimes he let the heard passe by as though he had not seene th?. Whereat when this noble Lord tooke some pastime, and had often put him in remembrance of his good skill in choosing, and readinesse in killing of a winter deare, he thought good thus to excuse it in verse. My woorthy Lord, I pray you wonder not, To see your woodman shoote so ofte awrie, Nor that he stands amased like a sot, And lets the harmlesse deare (unhurt) go by. Or if he strike a Doe which is but carren, Laugh not good Lord, but favoure such a fault, Take will in worth, he would faine hit the barren, But though his harte be good, his happe is naught: And therefore now I crave your Lordships leave, To tell you plaine what is the cause of this: First if it please your honour to perceyve, What makes your woodman shoote so ofte amisse, Beleeve me L. the case is nothing strange, He shootes awrie almost at every marke, His eyes have bene so used for to raunge, That now God knowes they be both dimme and darke. For proofe he beares the note of follie now, Who shotte sometimes to hit Philosophie, And aske you why? forsooth I make avow, Bicause his wanton wittes went all awrie. Next that, he shot to be a man of lawe, And spent sometime with learned Litleton, Yet in the end, he proved but a dawe, For lawe was darke and he had quickly done. Then could he with Fitzharbert such a braine, As Tully had, to write the lawe by arte, So that with pleasure, or with litle paine, He might perhaps, have caught a trewants parte. But all to late, he most mislikte the thing, Which most might helpe to guide his arrow streight: He winked wrong, and so let slippe the string, Which cast him wide, for all his queint conceit. From thence he shotte to catch a courtly grace, And thought even there to wield the world at will, But out alas he much mistooke the place, And shot awrie at every rover still. The blasing baits which drawe the gazing eye, Unfethered there his first affection, No wonder then although he shot awrie, Wanting the feathers of discretion. Yet more than them, the marks of dignitie, He much mistooke and shot the wronger way, Thinking the purse of prodigalitie, Had bene best meane to purchase such a pray. He thought the flattring face which fleareth still, Had bene full fraught with all fidelitie, And that such wordes as courtiers use at will, Could not have varied from the veritie. But when his bonet buttened with gold, His comelie cape begarded all with gay, His bumbast hose, with linings manifold, His knit silke stocks and all his queint aray, Had pickt his purse of all the Peter pence, Which might have paide for his promotion, Then (all to late) he found that light expence, Had quite quencht out the courts devotion. So that since then the tast of miserie, Hath bene alwayes full bitter in his bit, And why? forsooth bicause he shot awrie, Mistaking still the markes which others hit. But now behold what marke the man doth find, He shootes to be a souldier in his age, Mistrusting all the vertues of the minde, He trusts the power of his personage. As though long limmes led by a lusty hart, Might yet suffice to make him rich againe, But Flushyng fraies have taught him such a parte, That now he thinks the warres yeeld no such gaine. And sure I feare, unlesse your lordship deigne, To traine him yet into some better trade, It will be long before he hit the veine, Whereby he may a richer man be made. He cannot climbe as other catchers can. To leade a charge before himselfe be led, He cannot spoile the simple sakeles man, Which is content to feede him with his bread. He cannot pinch the painefull souldiers pay, And sheare him out his share in ragged sheetes, He cannot stoupe to take a greedy pray Upon his fellowes groveling in the streetes. He cannot pull the spoyle from such as pill, And seeme full angrie at such foule offence, Although the gayne content his greedie will, Under the cloake of contrarie pretence: And now adayes, the man that shootes not so, May shoote amisse, even as your Woodman dothe: But then you marvell why I lette them go, And never shoote, but saye farewell forsooth: Alas my Lord, while I doe muze hereon, And call to minde my youthfull yeares myspente, They give mee suche a boane to gnawe upon, That all my senses are in silence pente. My minde is rapte in contemplation, Wherein my dazeled eyes onely beholde, The blacke houre of my constellation, Which framed mee so lucklesse on the molde: Yet therewithall I can not but confesse, That vayne presumption makes my heart to swell, For thus I thinke, not all the worlde (I guesse,) Shootes better bet than I, nay some shootes not so well. In Aristotle somewhat did I learne, To guyde my manners all by comelynesse, And Tullie taught me somewhat to discerne Betweene sweete speeche and barbarous rudenesse. Olde Parkyns, Rastall, and Dan Bractens bookes, Did lende mee somewhat of the lawlesse Lawe, The craftie Courtiers with their guylefull lookes, Must needes put some experience in my mawe: Yet can not these with many maystries mo, Make me shoote streyght at any gaynfull pricke, Where some that never handled such a bow, Can hit the white, or touch it neare the quicke, Who can nor speake, nor write in pleasant wise, Nor leade their life by Aristotles rule, Nor argue well on questions that arise, Nor pleade a case more than my Lord Mairs mule, Yet can they hit the marks that I do misse, And winne the meane which may the man mainteyne. Now when my minde doth mumble upon this, No wonder then although I pine for payne: And whiles mine eyes beholde this mirrour thus, The hearde goeth by, and farewell gentle does: So that your Lordship quickely may discusse What blindes mine eyes so ofte (as I suppose.) But since my Muse can to my Lorde reherse What makes me misse, and why I doe not shoote, Let me imagine in this woorthlesse verse, If right before mee, at my standings foote There stoode a Doe, and I should strike hir deade, And then shee prove a carrian carkas too, What figure might I finde within my head, To scuse the rage whiche rulde mee so to doo? Some myght interprete by playne paraphrase, That lacke of skill or fortune ledde the chaunce, But I must otherwise expounde the case, I say Jehova did this Doe advaunce, And made hir bolde to stande before mee so, Till I had thrust mine arrowe to hir harte, That by the sodaine of hir overthrowe, I myght endevour to amende my parte, And turne myne eyes that they no more beholde, Such guylefull markes as seeme more than they be: And though they glister outwardely like golde, Are inwardly but brasse, as men may see: And when I see the milke hang in hir teate, Me thinkes it sayth, olde babe now learne to sucke, Who in thy youth couldst never learne the feate To hitte the whytes whiche live with all good lucke. Thus have I tolde my Lorde, (God graunt in season) A tedious tale in rime, but little reason. Haud ictus sapio. Gascoignes gardnings, whereof were written in one end of a close walke whiche he hath in his Garden, this discourse following. The figure of this world I can compare, To Garden plots, and such like pleasaunt places, The world breedes men of sundry shape and share, As hearbes in gardens, grow of sundry graces: Some good, some bad, some amiable faces, Some foule, some gentle, some of froward mind, Subject like bloome, to blast of every wind. And as you see the floures most fresh of hew, That they prove not alwayes the holesomest, So fayrest men are not alwayes found true: But even as withred weedes fall from the rest, So flatterers fall naked from their neast: When truth hath tried, their painting tising tale, They loose their glosse, and all their jests seeme stale. Yet some do present pleasure most esteeme, Till beames of braverie wither all their welth, And some agayne there be can rightly deeme, Those herbes for best, which may mainteine their helth. Considering well, that age drawes on by stelth, And when the fayrest floure is shronke and gone, A well growne roote, will stand and shifte for one. Then thus the restlesse life which men here leade, May be resembled to the tender plant, In spring it sprouts, as babes in cradle breede, Florish in May, like youthes that wisdome want, In Autumne ripes and rootes, least store waxe skante In winter shrinks and shrowdes from every blast, Like crooked age when lusty youth is past. And as the grounde or grace whereon it grewe, Was fatte or leane, even so by it appeares, If barreyn soyle, why then it chaungeth hewe, It fadeth faste, it flits to fumbling yeares, But if he gathered roote amongst his feeres, And light on lande that was well muckte in deede, Then standes it still, or leaves increase of seede. As for the reste, fall sundrie wayes (God wot) Some faynt lyke froathe at every little puffe, Some smarte by swoorde, like hearbes that serve the pot, And some be weeded from the finer stuffe, Some stande by proppes to maynteyne all their ruffe: And thus (under correction bee it tolde) Hath Gascoigne gathered in his Garden molde. Haud ictus sapio. In that other ende of his sayde close walke, were written these toyes in ryme. If any floure that here is growne, Or any hearbe may ease your payne, Take and accompte it as your owne, But recompence the lyke agayne: For some and some is honest playe, And so my wyfe taughte me to saye. If here to walke you take delight, Why come, and welcome when you will: If I bidde you suppe here this night, Bidde me an other time, and still Thinke some and some is honest playe, For so my wife taught me to saye. Thus if you suppe or dine with mee, If you walke here, or sitte at ease, If you desire the thing you see, And have the same your minde to please, Thinke some and some is honest playe, And so my wife taught me to saye. Haud ictus sapio. In a chayre in the same Garden was written this followyng. If thou sitte here to viewe this pleasant garden place Think thus: at last will come a frost, &amp; all these floures deface: But if thou sitte at ease to rest thy wearie bones, Remember death brings finall rest to all oure greevous grones. So whether for delight, or here thou sitte for ease, Thinke still upon the latter day, so shalt thou God best please. Haud ictus sapio. Upon a stone in the wall of his Garden he had written the yeare wherein he did the coste of these devises, and therewithall this posie in Latine. Quoniam etiam humiliatos, amœna delectant. Gascoignes voyage into Hollande. An. 1572. written to the right honourable the Lorde Grey of Wilton. A straunge conceyte, a vayne of newe delight, Twixt weale and woe, twixte joy and bitter griefe, Hath pricked foorth my hastie penne to write This woorthlesse verse in hazarde of repreefe: And to mine best beloved Alderlievest Lorde I must endite A wofull case, a chippe of sorie chaunce, A tipe of heaven, a lively hew of hell, A feare to fall, a hope of high advance, A life, a death, a drearie tale to tell. But since I know the pith of my pastaunce Shall most consist in telling of a truth, Vouchsafe my Lord in good worth (en bon gré) for to take This trustie tale the storie of my youth, This Chronicle which of my selfe I make, To shew my Lord what healplesse happe ensewth, When heddy youth will gad without a guide, And raunge untide in leas of libertie, Or when bare neede a starting hole hath spide To peepe abroade from mother Miserie, And buildeth Castels in the Welkin wide, In hope thereby to dwell with wealth and ease. But he the Lord (whome my good Lord doth know) Can bind or lose, as best to him shall please, Can save or spill, rayse up or overthrowe, Can gauld with griefe, and yet the payne appease. Which thing to prove if so my L. take time, (When greater cares his head shall not possesse) To sitte and reade this raunging ragged rime, I doubt not then but that he will confesse, What falles I found when last I leapt to clime. In March it was, that cannot I forget, In this last March upon the nintenth day, When from Gravesend in boate I gan to jette To boorde our shippe in Quinborough that lay, From whence the very twentith day we set Our sayles abrode to slice the Salt sea fome, And ancors weyde gan trust the trustlesse floud: That day and night amid the waves we rome To seeke the coast of Holland where it stoode. And on the next when we were farre from home, And neare the haven whereto we sought to sayle, A fearly chaunce: (whereon alone to thinke My hande now quakes, and all my senses fayle) Gan us befall: the Pylot gan to shrinke, And all agaste his courage seemde to quayle. Whereat amazed, the Maister and his mate Gan aske the cause of his so sodeyne chaunge, And from alofte the Stewarde of our state, (The sounding plumbe) in haste poste hast must raunge, To trye the depth and goodnesse of our gate. Mee thinkes (even yet) I heare his heavie voyce, Fadom &amp; a half, three ho.Fadome three, foure, foote more, foote lesse, that cride: Mee thinkes I heare the fearefull whispring noyse, Of such as sayde full softely (me beside) God graunte this journey cause us to rejoyce, When I poore soule, which close in caban laye, And there had reacht till gaule was welneare burst, With giddie head, my stumbling steppes must stay To looke abroade as boldly as I durst. And whyles I hearken what the Saylers saye, The sownder sings, fadame two full no more. Aloofe, aloofe, then cried the Maister out, The Stearesmate strives to sende us from the shore, And trustes the streame, whereof wee earst had doubt, Tweene two extreeme thus were we tossed sore, And went to When all sayles are tak? downe. Hull, untill we leyzure had To talke at large, and eke to know the cause What moode had made our Pylot looke so sad. At last the Dutche with butterbitten jawes, (For so he was a Dutche, a Devill, a swadde, A foole, a drunkarde, or a traytour tone) Gan aunswere thus: You be to soone Ghy zijt te vroegh here come, It is not good tide, Tis niet goet tijt and standing all alone, Gan preache to us, which fooles were all and some To trust him foole, in whom there skill was none. Or what knew wee if Albaes subtill brayne (So to prevent our enterpryse by treazon) Had him subornde to tice us to this trayne And so him selfe (per Companye and seazon) For spite, for hate, or else for hope of gayne. This must we thinke that the Duke. Alba would not spare To give out gold for such a sinfull deede: And glistring gold can oftentimes ensnare, More perfect wits than Holland soyle doth breede. But let that passe, and let us now compare Our owne fond fact with this his foule offence. We knew him not, nor where he wond that time, Nor if he had Pylots experience, Or Pylats crafte, to cleare him selfe from crime. Yea more than that (how voyde were we of sense) We had small smacke of any tale he tolde, He powrde out Dutch to drowne us all in drinke, And we (wise men) uppon his words were bolde, To runne on head: but let me now bethinke The masters speech: and let me so unfold The depth of all this foolish oversight. The master spake even like a skilfull man, And sayde I sayle the Seas both day and night, I know the tides as well as other can, From pole to pole I can the courses plight: I know France, Spaine, Greece, Denmarke, Da?sk &amp; all, Frize, Flaunders, Holland, every coast I know, But truth to tell, it seldome doth befall, That English merchants ever bend their bowe To shoote at Breyll, where now our flight should fall, They send their shafts farder for greater gayne. So that this haven is yet (quoth he) unknowen unkouth, And God graunt now that England may attayne Such gaines by Breyll, (a gospell on that mouth) As is desired: thus spake the master playne. And since (saide he) my selfe knew not the sowne, How could I well a better Pylot fynde, Than this (which first) did saye he dwelt in towne, And knew the way where ever sat the wynde? While we thus talke, all sayles are taken downe, And we to Hull (as earst I sayd) gan wend, Till full two houres and somewhat more were past. Our guyde then spake in Dutch and bad us bend All sayles againe: for now quod he (at last) It is good tide that know I well Die tijt is goet, dat heb ick weell bekend. Why staye I long to ende a wofull tale? We trust his Dutch, and up the foresayle goes, We fall on knees amyd the happy gale, (Which by Gods will full kynd and calmely blowes) And unto him we there unfolde our bale, Whereon to thinke I wryte and weepe for joye, That pleasant song the hundreth and seventh Psalme, There dyd we reade to comfort our annoye, Which to my soule (me thought) was sweete as balme, Yea farre more sweete than any worldly toye. And when he had with prayers praysd the Lord, Our Lusty gallants Edell Bloetts, gan fall to eate and drinke, And for their sauce, at takyng up the borde The shippe so strake (as all we thought to sinke) Against the ground. Then all with one accorde We fell againe on knees to pray apace, And therewithall even at the second blowe, (The number cannot from my minde outpace) Our helme strake of, and we must fleete and flowe, Where winde and waves would guide us by their grace. The winde waxt calme as I have sayde before, (O mightie God so didst thou swage our woes) The selly shippe was sowst and smitten sore, With counter buffetts, blowes and double blowes. At last the keele which might endure no more, Gan rende in twayne and suckt the water in: Then might you see pale lookes and wofull cheare, Then might you heare loude cries and deadly dinne: Well noble minds in perils best appeare, And boldest harts in bale will never blinne. For there were some (of whome I will not say That I was one) which never changed hew, But pumpt apace, and labord every way To save themselves, and all their lovely crew, Which cast the best fraight overboorde away, Both corne and cloth, and all that was of weight. Which halde and pulde at every helping corde, Which prayed to God and made their conscience streight. As for my self: I here protest my Lorde, My words were these: O God in heaven on height, Behold me not as now a wicked wight, A sacke of sinne, a wretch ywrapt in wroth, Let no fault past (O Lord) offende thy sight, But weye my will which now those faults doth lothe, And of thy mercy pittie this our plight. Even thou good God which of thy grace didst saye That for one good, thou wouldst all Sodome save, Behold us all: thy shyning beames displaye, Some here (I trust) thy goodnesse shall engrave, To be chast vessels unto thee alwaye, And so to live in honour of thy name: Beleve me Lord, thus to the Lord I sayde. But there were some (alas the more their blame) Which in the pumpe their onely comfort layde, And trusted that to turne our griefe to game. Alas (quod I) our pumpe good God must be, Our sayle, our sterne, our tackling, and our trust. Some other cried to cleare the shipboate free, To save the chiefe and leave the rest in dust. Which word once spoke (a wondrous thing to see) All hast post hast, was made to have it done: And up it commes in hast much more than speede. There did I see a wofull worke begonne, Which now (even now) doth make my hart to bleede. Some made such hast that in the boate they wonne, Before it was above the hatches brought. Straunge tale to tell, what hast some men shall make To find their death before the same be sought. Some twixt the boate and shippe their bane do take, Both drownd and slayne with braynes for hast crusht out. At last the boat halfe fraighted in the aire Is hoyst alofte, and on the seas downe set, When I that yet in God could not dispaire, Still plide the pumpe, and patiently did let All such take boate as thither made repaire. And herewithall I safely may protest I might have wonne the boate as wel as one, And had that seemed a safetie for the rest I should percase even with the first have gone. But when I saw the boate was over prest And pestred full with moe than it might beare, And therwithall with cherefull looke might see My chiefe companions whome I held most deare Yorke and Herle. (Whose companie had thither trained me) Abiding still aboorde our shippe yfeare: Nay then (quoth I) good God thy will be done, For with my feeres I will both live and dye. And eare the boate farre from our sight was gon The wave so wrought, that they (which thought to flee And so to scape) with waves were overronne. Lo how he strives in vaine that strives with God For there we lost the flowre of the band, And of our crew full twentie soules and odde, The Sea sucks up, whils we on hatches stand In smarting feare to feele that selfe same rodde. Well on (as yet) our battred barke did passe, And brought the rest within a myle of lande, Then thought I sure now neede not I to passe, For I can swymme and so escape this sande. Thus dyd I deeme all carelesse like an Asse, When sodaynely the wynde our foresayle tooke, And turnd about and brought us eft to Seas. Then cryed we all, cast out the ancor hooke, And here let byde such helpe as god may please: Which ancor cast, we soone the same forsooke, And cut it off, for feare least thereupon Our shippe should bowge, then callde we fast for fire, And so dischargde our great gunnes everychone, To warne the towne thereby of our desire: But all in vayne, for succor sent they none. At last a Hoy from Sea came flinging fast, And towards us helde course as streight as lyne. Then might you see our hands to heaven up cast To render thanks unto the power devine, That so vouchsafte to save us yet at last: But when this Hoy gan (welneere) boorde our barke, And might perceive what peryll we were in, It turnd a way and left us still in care carke, This tale is true (for now to lie were sin) It lefte us there in dreade and daungers darke. It lefte us so, and that within the sight And hearing both of all the peare at Breyll. Now ply thee pen, and paint the foule despite Of drunken Dutchmen standing there even still, For whom we came in their cause for to fight, For whom we came their state for to defende, For whom we came as friends to grieve their foes, They now disdaynd (in this distresse) to lend One helping boate for to asswage our woes: They sawe our harmes the which they would not mend, And had not bene that God even then did rayse Some instruments to succor us at neede, We had bene sunk and swallowed all in Seas. But Gods will was (in way of our good speede) That on the peare (lamenting our mysease) Some englishe were, whose naked swordes did force The drunken dutch, the cankred churles to come, And so at last (not moved by remorce, But forst by feare) they sent us succor some: Some must I say: and for to tell the course, They sent us succor saust with sowre despite, They saved our lives and spoylde us of the rest, They stale our goods by day and eke by night, They shewed the worst and closely kept the best. And in this time (this treason must I wryte) Our Pylot fled, but how? not emptie handed: He fled from us, and with him did conveye A Hoy full fraught (whiles we meane while were landed) With pouder, shotte, and all our best araye: This skill he had, for all he set us sanded. And now my Lord, declare your noble mynde, Was this a Pylot, or a Pilate judge? Or rather was he not of Judas kynde: Which left us thus and close away could trudge? Well, at the Bryell to tell you what we finde, The Governour was all bedewed with drinke, His truls and he were all layde downe to sleepe, And we must shift, and of our selves must thinke What meane was best, and how we best might keepe That yet remaynd: the rest was close in clinke. Well, on our knees with trickling teares of joye, We gave God thanks: and as we might, did learne What might be founde in every A Small bote. pynke and hoye. And thus my Lord, your honour may descerne Our perils past, and how in our anoye God saved me (your Lordshippes bound for ever) Who else should not be able now to tell, The state wherein this countrey doth persever, Ne how they seeme in carelesse mindes to dwell. (So did they earst and so they will do ever) And to my Lord for to bewray my minde Me thinkes they be a race of Bulbeefe borne, Whose hartes their Butter mollyfieth by kinde, And so the force of beefe is cleane outworne: And eke their braines with double beere are lynde: So that they march bumbast with buttred beere, Like soppes of browesse puffed up with froth, Where inwardely they be but hollowe geere, As weake as winde, which with one puffe up goeth: And yet they bragge, and thinke they have no peere, Bicause Harlem hath hitherto helde out, Although in deed (as they have suffred Spayne) The ende thereof even now doth rest in doubt. Well, as for that, let it (for me) remaine In God his hands, whose hand hath brought me out, To tell my Lord this tale nowe tane in hande, As howe they traine their trezons all in drinke, And when them selves for drunk can scarcely stande, Yet sucke out secretes (as them selves do thinke) From guests. The best (almost) in all their lande, (I name no man, for that were brode before) Will (as men say) enure the same sometime, But surely this (or I mistake him sore) Or else he can (but let it passe in rime) Dissemble deepe, and mocke sometimes the more: Well, drunkennesse is here good companie, And therewithall per consequens it falles That whordome is accompted jollitie: A gentle state, where two suche Tenisballes Are tossed still and better bowles let lie. I cannot herewith from my Lord conceale, How God and Mammon here do dwell yfeare, And how the Masse is cloked under veale Of pollicie, till all the coast be cleare. Ne can I chuse, but I must ring a peale, To tell what hypocrytes the Nunnes here be: And how the olde Nunnes be content to go, Before a man in streates like mother B, Untill they come wheras there dwels a Ho, (Re:ceyve that halfe, and let the rest go free) There can they poynt with finger as they passe, Yea sir, sometimes they can come in themselfe, To strike the bergaine tweene a wanton lasse, And Edel bloets: nowe is not this good pelfe? As for the yong Nunnes, they be bright as glasse, And chaste forsooth, met v: and anders niet: What sayde I? what? that is a misterie, I may no verse of such a theame endite, Yong Rowlande Yorke may tell it bet than I: Yet to my Lorde this little will I write, That though I have (my selfe) no skill at all, To take the countnance of a Colonel, Had I a good Lieutenant general, As good John Zuche wherever that he dwel, Or else Ned Dennye (faire mought him befal) I coulde have brought a noble regiment Of smugskinnde Nunnes into my countrey soyle: But farewell they as things impertinent, Let them (for me) go dwell with master Moyle, Who hath behight to place them well in Kent. And I shall well my sillie selfe content, To come alone unto my lovely Lorde, And unto him (when riming sporte is spent) To tel some sadde and reasonable worde, Of Hollandes state, the which I will present, In Cartes, in Mappes, and eke in Models made, If God of heaven my purpose not prevent. And in meane while although my wits do wade In ranging rime, and fling some follie foorth, I trust my Lorde will take it well in woorth. Haud ictus sapio. WEEDES. The fruite of Fetters: with the complaint of the greene Knight, and his Farewell to Fansie. Great be the greefes which bruze the boldest brests, And al to seelde we see such burdens borne, For cruell care (which reaveth quiet rests) Hath oftentimes the woorthiest willes foreworne, And layed such weight upon a noble harte, That wit and will have both given place to smarte. For proofe wherof I tel this woful tale, (Give eare that list, I force no frolicke mindes) But such as can abide to heare of bale, And rather rue the rage which Fansie findes, Than scorne the pangs which may procure their pine, Let them give eare unto these rimes of mine. I teare my time (ay me) in prison pent, Wherin the floure of my consuming yeares, With secret grief my reason doth torment, And frets it self (perhaps) with needlesse feares: For whyles I strive against the streame too fast, My forces faile, and I must downe at last. The hastie Vine for sample might me serve, Which climbes too high about the loftie tree, But when the twist his tender jointes doth carve, Then fades he fast, that sought full fresh to bee: He fades and faintes before his fellowes faile, Which lay full lowe, and never hoyst up saile. Ay me, the dayes which I in dole consume, Ah las, the nightes which witnesse well my woe, O wrongful world which makst my fansie fume, Fie fickle Fortune, fie thou arte my foe, Out and alas, so frowarde is my chaunce, No dayes nor nightes, nor worldes can me advaunce. In recklesse youth, the common plague of Love Infected me (al day) with carelesse minde, Entising dames my patience still did prove, And blearde mine eyes, till I became so blinde, That seing not what furie brought mee foorth, I followed most (alwayes) that least was woorth. In middle yeares, the reache of Reasons reine No sooner gan to bridle in my will, Nor naked neede no sooner gan constreine My rash decay to breake my sleepes by skill, But streight therewith hope set my heart on flame, To winne againe both wealth and woorthy name. And thence proceedes my most consuming griefe, For whyles the hope of mine unyolden harte In endlesse toyles did labor for reliefe, Came crabbed Chance and marrde my merry marte: Yea, not content with one fowle overthrowe, So tied me fast for tempting any mo. She tied me fast (alas) in golden chaines, Wherein I dwell, not free, nor fully thrall, Where guilefull love in double doubt remaines, Nor honie sweet, nor bitter yet as gall: For every day a patterne I beholde Of scortching flame, which makes my heart full colde. And every night, the rage of restlesse thought Doth raise me up, my hope for to renewe, My quiet bed which I for solace sought, Doth yrke mine eares, when still the warlike crewe With sounde of drummes, and trumpets braying shrill Relieve their watch, yet I in thraldome still. The common joy, the cheere of companie, Twixt mirth and moane doth plundge me evermore: For pleasant talke, or Musicks melodie, Yeeld no such salve unto my secret sore, But that therewith this corsive coms me too, Why live not I at large as others doo? Lo thus I live in spite of cruell death, And die as fast in spite of lingring life, Fedde still with hope which doth prolong my breath, But choakte with feare, and strangled still with strife, Starke staring blinde bicause I see too much, Yet gasing still bicause I see none such. Amid these pangs (O subtil Cordial) Those farrefet sighes which most mens mindes eschewe, Recomforte me, and make the furie fall, Which fedde the roote from whence my fits renewe: They comforte me (ah wretched doubtfull clause) They helpe the harme, and yet they kill the cause. Where might I then my carefull corpse convay From companie, which worketh all my woe? How might I winke or hide mine eyes alway, Which gaze on that wherof my griefe doth growe? How might I stoppe mine eares, which hearken still, To every joy, which can but wounde my will? How should I seeme my sighes for to suppresse, Which helpe the heart that else would swelt in sunder? Which hurt the helpe that makes my torment lesse? Which helpe and hurte (oh wofull wearie wonder) One seely hart[e] thus toste twixt helpe and harme, How should I seeme, such sighes in tyme to charme? How? how but thus? in sollitarie wise To steppe aside, and make high way to moane: To make two fountaines of my dazled eies, To sigh my fill till breath a[n]d all be gone: So sighed the knight of whome Bartello writes, All cladde in Greene, yet banisht from delights. And since the storye is both new and trew, A dreary tale much like these lottes of myne I will assaye my muze for to renewe, By ryming out his frowarde fatall fine. A dolefull speeche bec?mes a dumpish man, So semde by him, for thus his tale begane. The complaint of the greene Knight. Why live I wretch (quoth he) alas and wellaway, Or why beholde my heavy eies, this gladsome sunny day? Since never sunne yet shone, that could my state advaunce, Why live I wretche (alas quoth he) in hope of better chaunce? Or wherefore telles my toung, this drearye dolefull tale, That every eare might heare my grieefe and so bemone my bale? Since eare was never yet, that harkened to my playnte, Why live I wretch (alas quoth he) my pangs in vaine to paint? Or wherfore dotes desire, that doth his wish disclose, And shewes the sore that seeks recure, thereby to ease my woes? Since yet he never found, the hart where pyttie dwelt, Why live I wretch (alas quoth he) alone in woe to swelt? Why strive I with the streame, or hoppe against the hill, Or search that never can be founde, or loose my labor still? Since destenies decreed, must alwayes be obeyde, Why live I wretch alas (quoth he) with lucke thus overleyde? Why feedes my heart on hope? why tyre I still on trust? Why doth my minde still muse on mirth? why leanes my life on lust? Since hope had never hap, &amp; trust always found treason, Why live I wretch alas (quoth he) where all good luck is geazon? The fatal Sisters three, which spun my slender twine, Knew wel how rotten was the yarne, fr? whence they drew their line: Yet have they woven the web, with care so manifolde, (Alas I woful wretch the while) as any cloth can holde: Yea though the threeds be cowrse, and such as others lothe, Yet must I wrap alwayes therin, my bones and body both: And weare it out at length, which lasteth but too long. O weaver weaver work no more, thy warp hath done me wrong: For therin have I lapt my light and lustie yeares, And therin haplesse have I hapt, mine age and hoarie heares: Yet never found I warmth, by jetting in thy jaggs, Nor never can I weare them out, although they rende like raggs. The May-moone of mine age, I meane the gallant time When coales of kinde first kindled love, &amp; plesure was in prime, All bitter was the frute, which still I reaped then, And little was the gaine I got, comparde by other men. Teare-thirstie were the Dames, to whome I sued for grace, Some stonie stomackt, other some, of high disdainful race. But all unconstant (ay) and (that to thinke) I die, The guerdon which Cosmana gave, can witnesse if I lie. Cosmana was the wight to whome I wished well, To serve Cosmana did I seeme, in love to beare the bell: Cosmana was my god, Cosmana was my joy, Ay me, Cosmana turnde my mirth, to dole and dark anoy: Revenge it Radamanth, if I be found to lie, Or if I slaunder hir at all, condemne me then to die. Thou knowst I honored hir, no more but all too much, Alas thou knowst she cast me off, when I deservde no grutch. She dead (I dying yet) ay me my teares were dried, And teeth of time gnew out the grief, which al to long I tried, Yet from hir ashes sprung, or from such subtile molde, Ferenda she, whome everie eye, did judge more bright than golde. Ferenda then I sawe, Ferenda I behelde, Ferenda servde I faithfully, in towne and eke in fielde: Ferenda coulde not say, the greene Knight was untrew, But out alas, the greene Knight sayde, Ferenda changde for new: Ferenda did hir kinde: then was she to be borne, She did but weare Cosmanes cloutes, which she in spite had torne: And yet betwene them both they waare the threeds so neere, As were they not of steele or stone, they coulde not holde yfeere. But now Ferenda mine, a little by thy leave: What moved thee to madding moode? why didst thou me deceave? Alas I was al thine, thy selfe can say no lesse, And for thy fall, I bathed oft in many a deepe distresse: And yet to do thee right, I neyther blame thy race, Thy shining selfe, the golden gleames that glistred on thy face, Nor yet thy fickle faith, shall never beare the blame, But I, whome kinde hath framd to finde, a griefe in everie game: The high decrees of heaven, have limited my life, To linger stil wher Love doth lodge, yet there to sterve in strife. For proofe, who list to know what makes me nowe complaine, Give eare unto the greene Knights tale: for now begins his paine. When rash unbridled youth had run his recklesse race, And caried me with carelesse course, to many a great disgrace, Then riper mellowed yeares, thought good to turne their trade, And bad Repentance hol[d] the reines, to rule the brainsicke jade: So that with much to doo, the brydle helde him backe, And Reason made him byte on bit, which had a better smacke: And for I felte my selfe, by feeblenesse fordoonne, And panting still for lack of breath, as one much overroonne. Therefore I toke advise, to walke him first awhile, And so at length to set him up, his travayles to beguile: Yea when he curried was, and dusted slicke and trimme, I causde both hey and provander to be allowde for him: Wherat (alas to thinke) he gathered flesh so fast, That still he playd his coltish pranks, when as I thought th? past: He winched still alwayes, and whisked with his taile, And leaping over hedge and ditch, I sawe it not prevaile To pamper him so proude: Wherfore I thought it best, To travaile him (not as I woont) yet nay to give him rest. Thus well resolved then, I kept him still in harte, And founde a pretie provander appointed for his parte, Which once a day, no more, he might a little tast: And by this diet, made I youth a gentle jade at last: And foorth I might him ride, an easie journeying pace, He never strave with middle age, but gently gave him place: Then middle age stept in, and toke the helme in hande, To guide my Barke by better skill, into some better lande. And as eche noble heart is evermore most bent, To high exploites and woorthie deedes, where honor may be hent: So mine unyolden minde, by Armes gan seeke renowne, And sought to rayse, that recklesse youth had rashly t?bled downe. With sworde and trustie targe, then sought I for to carve For middle age and hoarie haires, and both their turnes to sarve: And in my Carvers roome, I gan to cut suche cuttes, And made suche morsels for their mouthes as well might fill their guttes, Beside some overplus, (which being kept in store) Might serve to welcome al their friends, with foison evermore: I meane no more but this: my hand gan finde such happe, As made me thinke, that Fortune ment, to play me in hir lappe: And hope therwith had heavde, my heart to be so hie, That still I hoapt, by force of armes, to climbe above the Skie: I bathed still in blisse, I ledde a lordelie life, My Souldiers lovde and fearde me both, I never dreaded strife: My boord was furnisht stil, with cates of dainty cost, My back wel clad, my purse wel lynde, my woonted lack was lost, My bags began to fil, my debtes for to discharge, My state so stoode, as sure I seemde to swim in good lucks barge: But out and well away, what pleasure breedes not paine? What sun c? shine without a cloud, what th?der brings not rain? Such is the life of man, such was the luck of me, To fall so fast from hiest hap, where sure I seemde to be. Five hundred sundrie sunnes (and more) could scarcely serve, By sweat of brows to win a roome, wherin my knife might carve: One onely dismall day, suffised (with despite) To take me from my carvers place, and from the table quite. Five hundred broken sleepes, had busied all my braynes, To find (at last) some worthy trade, that might increse my gaynes: One blacke unluckie houre, my trade hath overthrowen, And marrde my marte, &amp; broke my bank, &amp; al my blisse oreblowen. To wrappe up all in woe, I am in prison pent, My gaines possessed by my foes, my friends against me bent: And all the heavy haps, that ever age yet bare, Assembled are within my breast, to choake me up with care. My modest middle age, which lacks of youth the lust, Can beare no such gret burd?s now, but throwes them in the dust: Yet in this piteous plight, beholde me Lovers all, And rewe my grieves, least you your selves do light on such a fal. I am that wearie wretch, whom love always hath tyred, And fed me with such strange conceytes, as never man desired. For now (even now) ay me: I love and cannot chuse, So strangely yet, as wel may move the wisest mindes to muse. No blasing beauty bright, hath set my heart on fire, No ticing talke, no gorgeous gyte, tormenteth my desire, No bodie finely framde, no haggarde Falcons eie, No ruddie lip, no golden locks, hath drawne my minde awrie: No teeth of shining pearle, no gallant rosie hiew, No dimpled chinne, no pit in cheeke, presented to my view: In fine, no such delights, as lovers oft allure, Are cause why thus I do lament, or put my plaintes in ure: But such a strange affect, as both I shame to tell, And all the worlde may woonder much, how first therin I fell. Yet since I have begonne (quoth he) to tell my griefe, I wil nought hide, although I hope to finde no great reliefe. And thus, (quoth he) it is: Amongst the sundrie joyes Which I conceivde in feates of warre, and all my Martial toyes, My chaunce was late to have a peerlesse firelock peece, That to my wittes was nay the like, in Turkie nor in Greece: A peece so cleanly framde, so streight, so light, so fine, So tempred and so polished, as seemeth worke divine: A peece whose locke yet past, for why [it] never failde, And though I bent it night and day, the quicknesse never quailde: A peece as well renforst, as ever yet was wrought, The bravest peece for breech and bore, that ever yet was bought: The mounture so well made, and for my pitch so fit, As though I see faire peeces moe, yet fewe so fine as it: A peece which shot so well, so gently and so streight, It neyther bruzed with recule, nor wroong with overweight. In fine and to conclude, I know no fault thereby, That eyther might be thought in minde, or wel discernde with ey. This peece then late I had, and therin tooke delight, As much as ever proper peece did please a warlike wight. Nowe though it be not lost, nor rendred with the rest, Yet being shut from sight therof, how can I thinke me blest? Or which way should I hope, that such a jewell rare, Can passe unseen in any campe where cunning shooters are? And therewith am I sure, that being once espied, It never can escape their hands, but that it will be tried: And being once but prooved, then farewel frost for me, My peece, my locke, and all is lost, and I shall never see The like againe on earth. Nowe Lovers speake your minde, Was ever man so strangely stroke, or caught in such a kinde? Was ever man so fonde? was ever man so mad? Was ever man so woe begone? or in such cares yclad? For restlesse thus I rest, the wretchedst man on live, And when I thinke upon this peece, then still my woes revive. Nor ever can I finde good plaister for my paine, Unlesse my lucke might be so good, to finde that peece againe. To make my mourning more, where I in prison pine, I daily see a pretie peece, much like that peece of mine, Which helps my hurt, much like unto a broken shinne, That when it heales, begins to ytch, and then rubs off the skinne. Thus live I still in love, alas and ever shall, As well content to loose my peece, as gladde to finde my fall: A wonder to the worlde, a griefe to friendlie mindes, A mocking stocke to Momus race, and al such scornefull hindes, A love (that thinke I sure) whose like was never seene, Nor never warlike wight shal be in love as I have beene: So that in sooth (quoth he) I cannot blame the Dames, Whome I in youth did moste esteeme, I list not foile their fames, But there to lay the fault, from whence it first did flowe: I say my Fortune is the root, whence all these griefes did grow. Since Fortune then (quoth he) hath turnde to me hir backe, Shall I go yeeld to mourning moane, and cloath my self in blacke? No no, for noble mindes can beare no thraldome so, But rather shew a merrie cheere, when most they wade in wo. And so will I in greene, my careful corpse aray, To set a bragge amongst the best, as though my heart were gay: Not greene bicause I hope, nor greene bicause I joy, Nor greene, bicause I can delight in any youthfull toy: But greene, bicause my greeves are alway fresh and greene, Whose roote is such it cannot rot, as by the frute is seene. Thus sayde, he gave a groane, as though his heart had broke, And from the furnace of his breast, sent scalding sighes like smoke: And sighing so, he sate in solitarie wise, Conveying flouds of brynish teares, by conduct of his eyes. What ende he had God knoweth, Battello writes it not, Or if he do, my wittes are short, for I have it forgot. The continuance of the Author, upon the fruite of Fetters. Thus have you heard the green Knight make his mone, Which wel might move the hardest heart to melt: But what he ment, that knewe himselfe alone, For such a cause, in weerie woes to swelt: And yet by like, some peerlesse peece it was, That brought him so in raging stormes to passe. I have heard tell, and read it therewithall, That neare the Alpes a kinde of people bee, Which serve with shot, wherof the very ball Is bigge of bulke, the peece but short to see: But yet it shootes as farre, and eke as fast, As those which are yframde of longer last. The cause (say some) consisteth in the locke, Some other judge, bicause they be so strong, Renforced well, and breeched like a brocke, Stiffe, straight, and stout, which though they be not long, Yet spit they foorth their pellets such a pace, And with such force, as seemes a woondrous case. Some other thinke, the mettal maketh all, Which tempred is both rounde and smooth to see: And sure me thinkes, the bignesse of the ball, Ne yet the locke, should make it shoote so free, But even the breech of mettall good and sounde, Which makes the ball with greater force to bounde. For this we see, the stiffe and strongest arme, Which gives a jerke, and hath a cunning loose, Shootes furdest still, and doth alway most harme, For be his flights yfeathred from the goose, Or Peacockes quilles, or Raven, or Swanne, or Crowe, His shafts go swifte, when others flie but slowe. How so it be, the men that use to shoote In these short gunnes: are praysed for the best: And Princes seeke such shotte for to promoote As perfectest and better than the rest: So that (by like) their peeces beare the sway, Else other men could shoote as farre as they. Their peeces then are called Petronels, And they themselves by sundrie names are calld: As Bandolliers, for who in mountaynes dwels, In trowpes and bandes, ofte times is stoutly stalld: Or of the Stone wherwith the locke doth strike, Petronelliers, they called are by like. And so percase this peerelesse peece of his For which he mournde and made such ruefull mone, Was one of those: and therfore all his blisse, Was turnd to bale when as that peece was gone: Since Martial men do set their chief delight, In armes which are both free and fayre in sight. My selfe have seene some peece of such a pryce, As woorthy were to be esteemed well: For this you know in any straunge devise, Such things as seeme for goodnesse to excell, Are holden deare, and for great Jewels deemd, Bycause they be both rare and much esteemd. But now to turne my tale from whence I came, I saie his lottes and mine were not unlike: He spent his youth (as I did) out of frame, He came at last (like me) to trayle the pike. He pynde in pryson pinchte with privie payne, And I likewise in pryson still remayne. Yet some good fruite in fetters can I finde, As vertue rules in every kinde of vice: First pryson brings repentaunce to the minde, Which wandred earst in lust and lewde device. For hardest hartes by troubles yet are taught, That God is good when all the worlde is naught. If thou have ledde a carelesse lyfe at large, Without regard what libertie was worth: And then come downe to cruell Gaylours charge, Which keepes thee close and never lettes thee forth: Learne then this fruite in Fetters by thy selfe, That libertie is worth all worldly pelfe. Whose happe is such to yeelde himself in warre, Remembre then that peace in pleasure dwelles: Whose hartes are high and know not what they are Let such but marke the gingling of their belles: When fetters frette their anckles as they goe, Since none so high but that may come as lowe. To tell a truth and therein to be shorte, Prysons are plagues that fal for mans offence, Which maketh some in good and godly sorte, With contrite harte to grope their conscience. Repentance than steppes in and pardon craves, These fruites (with mo) are found in darksome caves. If thou have friends, there shalt thou know them right, Since fastest friends in troubles shew their fayth: If thou have foes, there shalt thou see their spight For all to true it is that Proverbe sayth: Where hedge is lowe, there every man treads downe, And friendship failes when Fortune list to frowne. Patience is founde in prison (though perforce) And Temprance taught where none excesse doth dwell, Exercise calles, least slouth should kill thy corse: Diligence drives thy busie braines to swell, For some devise which may redeeme thy state, These fruites I found in fetters all too late. And with these fruites another fruite I found, A strange conceyt, and yet a trustie truth: I found by proufe, there is no kinde of ground, That yeeldes a better croppe to retchlesse youth, Than that same molde where fetters serve for mucke, And wit stil woorkes to digge up better lucke. For if the seede of grace will ever growe, Then sure such soile will serve to beare it best, And if Gods mercie therewithall do flowe, Then springs it high, and ruffles with the rest: Oft hath bene seene such seede in prison cast, Which long kept close, and prospred yet at last. But therewithall there springs a kinde of Tares, Which are vile weedes, and must be rooted out, They choake up grace, and lap it fast in snares, Which oftentimes do drawe it deepe in dout, And hinders plantes which else would growe full hie, Yet is this weede an easie thing to spie. Men call it Fansie, sure a woorthlesse weede, And of the same full many sortes are found, Some fansies are, which thinke a lawfull deede To scape away, though faith full fast be bound: Some thinke by love, (nay lust in cloke of love) From fetters fast their selves for to remove. Some be, that meane by murder to prevaile, And some by fraude, as fansie rules the thought: Sometimes such frightes mens fansies do assaile, (That when they see their freedome must be bought) They vowe to take a stande on Shooters hill, Till rents come in to please their wicked will. Some fansies hopes by lies to come on floate, As for to tell their frends and kinne great tales, What wealth they lost in coyne, and many a coate, What powder packt in coffers and in males, What they must pay, and what their charge will be, Wherin they meane to save themselves a fee. Some fansies eke forecast what life to weelde, When libertie shall graunted be at last, And in the aire such castles gan they builde, That many times they fall againe as fast: For Fansie hinders Grace from glories crowne, As Tares and Byndes can plucke good graine adowne. Who list therfore by Fetters frute to have, Take Fansie first out of his privy thought, And when thou hast him, cast him in the wave Of Lethes lake: for sure his seede is nought. The greene Knight he, of whome I late did tell, (Mine Author sayth) badde Fansie thus farewell. The greene Knights farewell to Fansie. Fansie (quoth he) farewell, whose badge I long did beare, And in my hat full harebrayndly, thy flowers did I weare: To late I finde (at last), thy frutes are nothing worth, Thy blossomes fall &amp; fade full fast, though braverie bring th? forth. By thee I hoapt alwayes, in deepe delights to dwel, But since I finde thy ficklenesse, Fansie (quoth he) farewell. Thou madste me live in love, which wisedome biddes me hate, Thou bleardst mine eies &amp; madste me thinke, y? faith was mine by fate: By thee those bitter sweetes, did please my taste alway, By thee I thought that love was light, and payne was but a play: I thought that Bewties blase, was meete to beare the bell, And since I finde my selfe deceyved, Fansie (quoth he) farewell. The glosse of gorgeous courtes, by thee did please mine eye, A stately sight me thought it was, to see the brave go by: To see there feathers flaunte, to marke their straunge devise, To lie along in Ladies lappes, to lispe and make it nice: To fawne and flatter both, I liked sometimes well, But since I see how vayne it is, Fansie (quoth he) farewell. When court had cast me of, I toyled at the plowe My fansie stoode in straunge conceipts, to thrive I wote not how: By mils, by making malte, by sheepe and eke by swyne, By ducke and drake, by pigge and goose, by calves &amp; keeping kine: By feeding bullockes fat, when pryce at markets fell, But since my swaines eat up my gaines, Fansie (quoth he) farewell. In hunting of the deare, my fansie tooke delight, All forests knew, my folly still, the mooneshine was my light: In frosts I felt no cold, a sunneburnt hew was best, I sweate and was in temper still, my watching seemed rest: What daungers deepe I past, it follie were to tell, And since I sigh to thinke thereon, Fansie (quoth he) farewell. A fansie fedde me ones, to wryte in verse and rime, To wray my griefe, to crave reward, to cover still my crime: To frame a long discourse, on sturring of a strawe, To rumble rime in raffe and ruffe, yet all not worth an hawe: To heare it sayde there goeth, the Man that writes so well, But since I see, what Poetes bee, Fansie (quoth he) farewell. At Musickes sacred sounde, my fansies eft begonne, In concordes, discordes, notes and cliffes, in tunes of unisonne: In Hyerarchies and straynes, in restes, in rule and space, In monacordes and moving moodes, in Burdens under base: In descants and in chants, I streyned many a yel, But since Musicians be so madde, Fansie (quoth he) farewell. To plant straunge countrie fruites, to sow such seedes likewise, To digge &amp; delve for new fo?d rootes, where old might wel suffise: To proyne the water bowes, to picke the mossie trees, (Oh how it pleasd my fancie ones) to kneele upon my knees, To griffe a pippine stocke, when sappe begins to swell: But since the gaynes scarce quite the cost, Fansie (quoth he) farewell. Fansie (quoth he) farewell, which made me follow drommes, Where powdred bullets serves for sauce, to every dish that c?mes: Where treason lurkes in trust, where Hope all hartes beguiles, Where mischief lieth still in wayte, when fortune friendly smiles: Where one dayes prison proves, that all such heavens are hell, And such I feele the frutes thereof, Fansie (quoth he) farewell. If reason rule my thoughts, and God vouchsafe me grace Then comfort of Philosophie, shall make me chaunge my race: And fonde I shall it finde, that Fansie settes to showe, For weakely st?ds that building still, which lacketh grace by low: But since I must accept, my fortunes as they fell, I say God send me better speede, and Fansie now farewell. Epilogismus. See sweete deceipt, that can it self beguile, Behold selfe love, which walketh in a net: And seemes unseene, yet shewes it selfe therewhile, Before such eyes, as are in science set. The Greene knight here, leaves out his firelocke peece That Fancie hath not yet his last farewell. When Foxes preach, good folke beware your geese, But holla here, my muse to farre doth mell: Who list to marke, what learned preacher sayeth, Must learne withall, for to beleeve his lore: But what he doth, that toucheth nomans fayth, Though words with workes, (agreed) persuade the more, The mounting kite, oft lights on homely pray And wisest wittes, may sometimes go astray. FINIS. Tam Marti, quàm Mercurio. The pleasant Fable of Ferdinando Jeron[i]mi and Leonora de Valasco, translated out of the Italian riding tales of Bartello. The verse has been extracted from prose text. [Faire Bersabe the bright once bathing in a Well] Faire Bersabe the bright once bathing in a Well, With dewe bedimmd King Davids eies that ruled Israell. And Salomon him selfe, the source of sapience, Against the force of such assaultes could make but small defence: To it the stoutest yeeld, and strongest feele like wo, Bold Hercules and Sampson both, did prove it to be so. What wonder seemeth then? when starres stand thicke in skies, If such a blasing starre have power to dim my dazled eyes? Lenvoie. To you these fewe suffise, your wittes be quicke and good, You can conject by chaunge of hew, what humors feede my blood. F. J. [Of thee deare Dame, three lessons would I learne] Of thee deare Dame, three lessons would I learne: What reason first persuades the foolish Fly (As soone as shee a candle can discerne) To play with flame, till shee bee burnt thereby? Or what may move the Mouse to byte the bayte Which strikes the trappe, that stops hir hungry breth? What calles the bird, where snares of deepe deceit Are closely coucht to draw hir to hir death? Consider well, what is the cause of this, And though percase thou wilt not so confesse, Yet deepe desire, to gayne a heavenly blisse, May drowne the minde in dole and darke distresse: Oft is it seene (whereat my hart may bleede) Fooles play so long till they be caught in deede. And then It is a heaven to see them hop and skip, And seeke all shiftes to shake their shackles off: It is a world, to see them hang the lip, Who (earst) at love, were wont to skorne and skoff. But as the Mouse, once caught in crafty trap, May bounce and beate against the boorden wall, Till shee have brought hir head in such mishap, That downe to death hir fainting lymbes must fall: And as the Flie once singed in the flame, Cannot commaund her wings to wave away: But by the heele, shee hangeth in the same Till cruell death hir hasty journey stay: So they that seeke to breake the linkes of love Strive with the streame, and this by paine I prove. For when I first beheld that heavenly hewe of thine, Thy stately stature, and thy comly grace, I must confesse these dazled eies of mine Did wincke for feare, when I first viewd thy face: But bold desire did open them againe, And bad mee looke till I had lookt to long, I pitied them that did procure my paine, And lov'd the lookes that wrought me all the wrong: And as the byrd once caught (but woorks hir woe) That strives to leave the limed twigges behind: Even so the more I strave to parte thee fro, The greater grief did growe within my minde: Remedilesse then must I yeeld to thee, And crave no more, thy servaunt but to bee. Till then and ever. HE. F. J. [Love, hope, and death, do stirre in me such strife] Love, hope, and death, do stirre in me such strife, As never man but I led such a life. First burning love doth wound my hart to death, And when death comes at call of inward griefe, Colde lingering hope doth feede my fainting breath Against my will, and yeeldes my wound reliefe: So that I live, but yet my life is such, As death would never greve me halfe so much. No comfort then but only this I tast, To salve such sore, such hope will never want, And with such hope, such life will ever last, And with such life, such sorrowes are not skant. Oh straunge desire, O life with torments tost Through too much hope, mine onely hope is lost. Even HE F. J. [In prime of lustie yeares, when Cupid caught mee in] In prime of lustie yeares, when Cupid caught mee in, And nature taught the waie to love, how I might best begin: To please my wandring eie, in beauties tickle trade, To gaze on eache that passed by, a carelesse sporte I made. With sweete entising baite, I fisht for manie a dame, And warmed me by manie a fire, yet felt I not the flame: But when at last I spied, that face that pleasde me most, The coales were quicke, the woode was drie, &amp; I began to tost. And smiling yet full oft, I have behelde that face, When in my hearte I might bewaile mine owne unluckie case: And oft againe with lokes that might bewraie my griefe, I pleaded harde for just rewarde, and sought to finde reliefe. What will you more? so oft my gazing eies did seeke, To see the rose and Lillie strive upon that livelie cheeke: Till at the last I spied, and by good proofe I founde, That in that face was painted plaine, the pearcer of my wound. Then (all to late) agast, I did my foote retire, And sought with secret sighes to quench my gredie skalding fire But lo, I did prevaile asmuche to guide my will, As he that seekes with halting heele, to hop against the hill. Or as the feeble sight, woulde searche the sunnie beame, Even so I founde but labour lost, to strive against the streame. Then gan I thus resolve, since liking forced love. Should I mislike my happie choice, before I did it prove? And since none other joye I had but her to see, S[h]oulde I retire my deepe desire? no no it would not bee: Though great the duetie were, that shee did well deserve, And I poore man, unworthie am so wo[r]thie a wight to serve. Yet hope my comfort staide, that she would have regard, To my good will that nothing crav'd, but like for just reward: I see the faucon gent sometime will take delight To seeke the solace of hir wing, and dallie with a kite. The fairest Woulf will choose the foulest for hir make, And why? because he doth indure most sorrow for hir sake: Even so had [I like] hope, when dolefull daies were spent When wearie wordes were wasted well, to open true entent. When fluddes of flowing teares, had washt my weeping eies, When trembling tongue had troubled hir, with loud lamenting cries: At last hir worthy will would pittie this my plaint, And comfort me hir owne poore slave, whom feare had made so faint. Wherefore I made a vowe, the stoany rocke should start, Ere I presume, to let her slippe out of my faithfull heart. Lenvoie. And when she sawe by proofe, the pith of my good will, She tooke in worth this simple song, for want of better skill: And as my just deserts, hir gentle hart did move, She was content to answere thus: I am content to love. F. J. [A cloud of care hath covred all my coste] A cloud of care hath covred all my coste, And stormes of strife doo threaten to appeare: The waves of woo, which I mistrusted moste, Have broke the bankes wherein my life lay cleere: Chippes of ill chaunce, are fallen amyd my choyce, To marre the mynd, that ment for to rejoyce. Before I sought, I founde the haven of hap, Wherin (once found) I sought to shrowd my ship, But lowring love hath lifte me from hir lap, And crabbed lot beginnes to hang the lip: The proppes of darke mistrust do fall so thick, They pearce my coate, and touch my skin at quick. What may be saide, where truth cannot prevaile? What plea maie serve, where will it selfe is judge? What reason rules, where right and reason faile? Remedilesse then must the guiltlesse trudge: And seeke out care, to be the carving knife, To cut the thred that lingreth such a life. F. J. [Dame Cinthia her selfe (that shines so bright] Dame Cinthia her selfe (that shines so bright, And dayneth not to leave hir loftie place: But onely then, when Phœbus shewes his face. Which is her brother borne and lendes hir light,) Disdaind not yet to do my Lady right: To prove that in such heavenly wightes as she, It fitteth best that right and reason be. For when she spied my Ladies golden raies, Into the cloudes, Hir head she shroudes, And shamed to shine where she hir beames displaies. Good reason yet, that to my simple skill, I should the name of Cynthia adore: By whose high helpe, I might beholde the more, My Ladies lovely lookes at mine owne will, With deepe content, to ga[z]e, and gaze my fill: Of courtesie and not of darcke disdaine, Dame Cy[n]thia disclosde my Lady plaine. Shee did but lende hir light (as for a lite) With friendely grace, To shew hir face, That else would shew and shine in hir dispight. Dan Phœbus hee with many a lowring looke, Had hir behelde [of] yore in angrie wise: And when he coulde none other meane devise To staine hir name, this deepe deceit he tooke, To be the baite that best might hide his hooke: Into hir eies his parching beames he cast, To skorche their skinnes, that gaz'd on hir full fast: Whereby when many a man was sunne burnt so They thought my Queene, The sonne had beene, With skalding flames, which wrought them all that wo, [So] that when many a looke had lookt so long, As that their eyes were dimme and dazaled both: Some fainting heartes that were both leude and loth To looke agayne from whence that error sprong, Gan close their eye for feare of farther wrong: And some againe once drawen into the maze, Gan leudly blame the beames of beauties blaze: But I with deepe foresight did soone espie, How phœbus ment, By false intent, To slaunder so her name with crueltie. Wherefore at better leasure thought I best, To trie the treason of his trecherie: And to exalt my Ladies dignitie When Phœbus fled and drewe him downe to rest. Amid the waves that walter in the west, I gan behold this lovely Ladies face, Whereon dame nature spent hir giftes of grace: And found therein no parching heat at all, But such bright hew, As might renew, An Aungels joyes in raigne celestiall. The courteouse Moone that wisht to do me good, Did shine to shew my dame more perfectly, But when she sawe hir passing jollitie, The Moone for shame, did blush as red as bloud, And shrounke a side and kept hir hornes in hoode: So that now when Dame Cynthia was gone, I might enjoye my Ladies lokes alone, Yet honoured still the Moone with true intent: Who taught us skill, To worke our will, And gave us place, till all the night was spent. F. J. [That selfe same day, and of that day that hower] That selfe same day, and of that day that hower, When she doth raigne, that mockt Vulcan the smith, And thought it meete to harbor in hir bower, Some gallant gest for hir to dally with, That blessed houre, that blist and happie daye, I thought it meete, with hastie steppes to go Unto the lodge, wherin my Lady laye, To laugh for joye, or else to weepe for woe. And lo, my Lady of hir wonted grace, First lent hir lippes to me (as for a kisse) And after that hir bodye to imbrace, Wherein dame nature wrought nothing amisse. What followed next, gesse you that know the trade, For in this sort, my F[r]ydaies feast I made. F. J. [Beautie shut up thy shop, and trusse up all thy trash] Beautie shut up thy shop, and trusse up all thy trash, My Nell hath stolne thy finest stuffe, &amp; left thee in the lash Thy market now is marde, thy gaines are gone god wot, Thou hast no ware, that maie compare, with this that I have got As for thy painted pale, and wrinckles surfled up: Are deare ynough, for such as lust to drinke of every cup: Thy bodies bolstred out, with bumbact and with bagges, Thy rowles, thy ruffes, thy caules, thy coifes, thy Jerkins &amp; thy Jagges. Thy curling, and thy cost, thy friesling and thy fare, To court to court with al those tois &amp; there set forth such ware Before their hungrie eies, that gaze on every gest, And choose the cheapest chaffaire still, to please their fancy best. But I whose stedfast eies, coulde never cast a glaunce, With w?dring loke, amid the prese, to take my choise by cha?ce Have wonne by due desert, a perce that hath no peere, And left the rest as refuse all, to serve the market there: There let him chuse that list, there catche the best who can: A painted blazing baite may serve, to choke a gazing man. But I have slipt thy flower, that freshest is of hewe: I have thy corne, goe sell thy chaffe, I list to seeke no new, The windowes of mine eies, are glaz'd with such delight, As eche new face seemes full of faultes, that blaseth in my sight: And not without just cause, I can compare her so, Loe here my glove I challenge him, that can, or dare say no. Let Theseus come with clubbe, or Paris bragge with brand, To prove how faire their Hellen was, that skourg'd the Greci? land: Let mighty Mars himselfe, come armed to the field: And vaunt dame Venus to def?d, with helmet, speare, &amp; shield. This hand that had good hap, my Hellen to embrace, Shal have like lucke to [foyle] hir foes, &amp; da?t them with disgrace. And cause them to confesse by verdict and by othe, How farre hir lovelie lookes do steine, the beauties of them both. And that my Hellen is more faire then Paris wife, And doth deserve more famous praise, then Venus for hir life. Which if I not perfourme, my life then let me leese, Or else be bound in chaines of change, to begge for beauties feese. F. J [The stately Dames of Rome, their Pearles did weare] The stately Dames of Rome, their Pearles did weare, About their neckes to beautifie their name: But she (whome I doe serve) hir pearles doth beare, Close in hir mouth, and smiling shewe, the same. No wonder then, though ev'ry word she speakes, A Jewell seeme in judgement of the wise, Since that hir sugred tongue the passage breakes, Betweene two rockes, bedeckt with pearles of price. Hir haire of golde, hir front of Ivory, (A bloody heart within so white a breast) Hir teeth of Pearle lippes Rubie, christall eye, Needes must I honour hir above the rest: Since she is fourmed of none other moulde, But Rubie, Christall, Ivory, Pearle, and Golde. Ferdinando Jeronimy. [What state to man, so sweete and pleasaunt weare] What state to man, so sweete and pleasaunt weare, As to be tyed, in linkes of worthy love? What life so blist and happie might appeare, As for to serve Cupid that God above? If that our mindes were not sometimes infect, With dread, with feare, with care, with cold suspect: With deepe dispaire, with furious frenesie, Handmaides to her, whome we call jelosie. For ev'ry other sop of sower chaunce, Which lovers tast amid their sweete delight: Encreaseth joye, and doth their love aduaunce, In pleasures place, to have more perfect plight. The thirstie mouth thinkes water hath good taste, The hungrie jawes, are pleas'd, with eche repaste: Who hath not prov'd what dearth by warres doth growe, Cannot of peace the pleasaunt plenties knowe. And though with eye, we see not ev'ry joye, Yet maie the minde, full well support the same, [An] absent life long led in great annoye (When presence comes) doth turne from griefe to game, To serve without reward is thought great paine, But if dispaire do not therewith remaine, It may be borne for right rewardes at last, Followe true service, though they come not fast. Disdaines, repulses, finallie eche ill, Eche smart, eche paine, of love eche bitter tast, To thinke on them gan frame the lovers will, To like eche joye, the more that comes at last: But this infernall plague if once it tutch, Or venome once the lovers mind with grutch, All festes and joyes that afterwardes befall, The lover comptes them light or nought at all. This is that sore, this is that poisoned wound, The which to heale, nor salve, nor ointmentes serve, Nor charme of wordes, nor Image can be founde, Nor observaunce of starres can it preserve, Nor all the art of Magicke can prevaile, Which Zoroactes found for our availe, Oh cruell plague, above all sorrowes smart, With desperate death thou sleast the lovers heart. And me even now, thy gall hath so enfect, As all the joyes which ever lover found, And all good haps, that ever Troylus sect, Atchieved yet above the luckles ground: Can never sweeten once my mouth with mell, Nor bring my thoughtes, againe in rest to dwell. Of thy mad moodes, and of naught else I thinke, In such like seas, faire Bradamant did sincke Ferdinando. Jeronimy. [I could not though I would: good Ladie saie not so] I could not though I would: good Ladie saie not so, Since one good word of your good wil might sone redresse my wo, Where would is free before, there could can never faile: For profe, you see how gallies passe where ships c? bere no saile, The wearie marriner where skies are overcast, By readie will doth guide his skil and wins the haven at last, The pretie bird that singes with pricke against her brest, Doth make a vertue of hir nede, to watche when others rest, And true the proverbe is, which you have laide apart, There is no hap can seeme to hard unto a willing heart. Then lovelie Ladie mine, you saie not as you should, In doutful tearms to answere thus: I could not though I would. Yes yes, full well you know, your can is quicke and good: And wilfull will is eke too swift, to shed my guiltlesse blood. But if good will were bent as prest as power is, Such will would quicklie find the skil to mende that is a misse. Wherefore if you desire to see my true love spilt, Commaund and I will slea my selfe, that yours maie be the gilt, But if you have no power to saie your servaunt naie, Write thus: I maie not as I would, yet must I as I maie. Ferdinando. Jeronimy. [With hir in armes that had my hart in holde] With hir in armes that had my hart in holde, I stoode of late to pleade for pitie so: And as I did hir lovelie lookes beholde, Shee cast a glaunce upon my rivall foe. His fleering face provoked hir to smile, When my salt teares were drowned in disdaine: He glad, I sad, he laught, (alas the while) I wept for woe: I pin'd for deadlie paine. And when I sawe none other boote prevaile, But reason rule must guide my skilfull minde: Why then (quod I) olde proverbes never faile, For yet was never good Cat out of kinde. Nor woman true but even as stories tell, Wonne with an egge, and lost againe with shell. Ferdinando. Jeronimy. [And if I did what then?] And if I did what then? Are you agreeved therefore? The Sea hath fishe for everie man, And what would you have more? Thus did my Mistresse once, Amaze my minde with doubt: And popt a question for the nonce, To beate my braines about. Whereto I thus replied, Eache Fisherman can wishe, That all the Seas at everie tide, Were his aloane to fishe. And so did I (in vaine,) But since it maie not be: Let such fishe there as finde the gaine, And leave the losse for me. And with such lucke and losse, I will content my selfe: Till tydes of turning time maye tosse, Suche fishers on the shelfe. And when they sticke on sandes, That everie man maie see: Then will I laugh and clappe my handes, As they doe nowe at mee. Ferdinando Jeronimy. Ever or never. In praise of a gentlewoman who though she were not verye fayre, yet was she as harde favoured as might be. If men may credite give, to true reported fames, Who doubtes but stately Rome had stoore of lustye loving Dames? Whose eares have bene so deafe, as never yet heard tell, Howe far the freshe Pompeia, for beautie dyd excel. And golden Marcus he, that swaide the Romaine sword, Bare witnesse of Boemia, by credite of his word. What neede I mo rehearse? since all the world dyd know, How high the floods of beauties blaze, within those walles dyd flowe. And yet in all that choyse a worthy Romaine Knight, Antonius who conquered prowde Egipt by his might, Not al to please his eye, but most to ease his minde, Chose Cleopatra for his love, and left the rest behind. She was an Egiptian.A wondrous thing to reade, in all his victorye, He snapt but hir for his owne share, to please his fantasie. She was not fayre God wot, the countreye breades none bright, Well maye we judge hir skinne the foyle, because hyr teeth were white. Percase hyr lovelye lookes, some prayses dyd deserve, But browne I dare be bolde shee was, for so the soyle dyd serve. And could Antonius forsake the fayre in Rome? To love his nutbrowne Ladye best, was this an equall doome? I dare well say dames there, did beare him deadly grudge, His sentence had beene shortly sayde, if Faustine had bene judge. For this I dare avow, (without vaunt be it spoke) So brave a knight as Anthony, held al their necks in yoke: I leave not Lucrece out, beleeve in hir who lyst, I thinke she would have lik'd his lure, &amp; stooped to his fist. What mov'd the chieftain then, to lincke his liking thus? I would some Romaine dame were here, the question to discusse. But [I that] read her life, do finde therein by fame, Howe cleare hir curtesie dyd shine, in honour of hir name. Hir bountie did excell, hir trueth had never pere, Hir lovely lokes, hir pleasant speech, hir lusty loving chere. And all the worthy giftes, that ever yet were found, Within this good Egiptian Queene, dyd seeme for to abound. Wherefore he worthy was, to win the golden fleece, Which scornd the blasing starres in Rome, to conquere such a peece. And shee to quite his love, in spite of dreadfull death, Enshrinde with Snakes within his Tombe, did yeeld hir parting breath. Allegoria. If fortune favord him, then may that man rejoyce, And thinke himself a happy man by hap of happy choice. Who loves and is belov'd of one as good, as true, As kind as Cleopatra was, and yet more bright of hewe. Hir eyes as greye as glasse, hir teeth as white as mylke, A ruddy lippe, a dimpled chyn, a skyn as smoth as silke. A wight what could you more, that may content mannes minde, And hath supplies for ev'ry want, that any man can finde. And may him selfe assure, when hence his life shall passe, She wil be stong to death with snakes, as Cleopatra was. Si fortunatus infœlix. The praise of Phillip Sparrowe. Of all the byrdes that I doe know, Phillip my Sparow hath no peare: For sit she high or lye she lowe, Be shee farre off, or be shee neare, There is no byrde so fayre, so fine, Nor yet so freshe as this of myne. Come in a morning mer[ri]ly, When Phillip hath bene lately fed, Or in an evening soberlye, When Phillip lyst to goe to bed: It is a heaven to heare my Phippe, Howe she can chirpe with chery lippe. She never wanders farre abroade, But is at hand when I doe call: If I commaund shee layes on loade, With lips, with teeth, with tongue and all. She chants, she chirpes, she makes such cheere, That I beleeve she hath no peere. And yet besides all this good sport, My Phillip can both sing and daunce: With new found toyes of sundry sort, My Phillip can both pricke and praunce: As if you saye but fend cut phippe, Lord how the peat will turne and skippe. Hir fethers are so freshe of hewe, And so well proyned everye daye: She lackes none oyle, I warrant you: To trimme hir tayle both tricke and gaye. And though hir mouth be somewhat wide, Hir tonge is sweet and short beside. And for the rest I dare compare, She is both tender, sweet and soft: She never lacketh dainty fare, But is well fed and feedeth oft: For if my phip have lust to eate, I warrant you phip lacks no meate. And then if that hir meat be good, And such as like do love alway: She will lay lips theron by the rood, And see that none be cast away: For when she once hath felt a fitte, Phillip will crie still, yit, yit, yit. And to tell trueth he were to blame, Which had so fine a Byrde as she, To make him all this goodly game, Without suspect or jellousie: He were a churle and knewe no good, Would see hir faynt for lacke of food. Wherfore I sing and ever shall, To prayse as I have often prov'd There is no byrd amongst them all, So worthy for to be belov'd. Let other prayse what byrd they will, Sweet Phillip shalbe my byrd still. Si fortunatus infœlix. [Thy byrth, thy beautie, nor thy brave attyre] Farewell with a mischeife, written by a lover being disdaynefullye abjected by a dame of highe calling, Who had chosen (in his place) a playe fellow of baser condition: &amp; therfore he determined to step a side, and before his departure giveth hir this farwell in verse. Thy byrth, thy beautie, nor thy brave attyre, (Disdaynfull Dame, which doest me double wrong) Thy hygh estate, which sets thy harte on fire, Or newe found choyse, which cannot serve thee long Shall make me dread, with pen for to reherse, Thy skittish deedes, in this my parting verse. For why thou knowest, and I my selfe can tell, By many vowes, how thou to me wert bound: And how for joye, thy hart did seeme to swell, And in delight, how thy desires were drownd. When of thy will, the walles I did assayle, Wherin fond fancie, fought for mine avayle. And though my mind, have small delight to vaunt, Yet must I vowe, my hart to thee was true: My hand was alwayes able for to daunt, Thy slaundrous fooes, and kepe theyr tongues in mew. My head (though dull) was yet of such devise, As might have kept thy name alwayes in price. And for the rest my body was not brave, But able yet, of substaunce to allaye, The raging lust, wherein thy limbes did rave, And quench the coales, which kindled thee to playe. Such one I was, and such alwayes wyl be, For worthy Dames, but then I meane not thee. For thou hast caught a proper paragon, A theefe, a cowarde, and a Peacocke foole: An Ase, a milkesop, and a minion, Which hath no oyle, thy furyous flames to coole, Such on he is, a pheare for thee most fit, A wandring gest, to please thy wavering wit. A theefe I counte him for he robbes us both, Thee of thy name, and me of my delight: A coward is he noted where he goeth, Since every child is match to him in might. And for his pride no more, but marke his plumes, The which to princke, he dayes and nights consumes. The rest thy selfe, in secret sorte can judge, He rides not me, thou knowest his sadell best: And though these tricks of thine, mought make me grudg, And kindle wrath, in my revenging brest Yet of my selfe, and not to please thy mind, I stand content, my rage in rule to binde. And farre from thee now must I take my flight, Where tongues maye tell, (and I not see) thy fall: Where I maye drinke these druggs of thy dispite, To purge my Melancholike mind with all. In secrete so, my stomacke will I sterve, Wishing thee better than thou doest deserve. Spræta tamen vivunt. The doale of disdaine written by a lover disdainfully rejected contrary to former promise. The deadly dropes of darke disdayne, Which dayly fall on my deserte, The lingring sute long spent in vayne, Wherof I feele no frute but smart: Enforce me now th[ese] wordes to write: Not all for love but more for spite. The which to the I must rehearse, Whom I dyd honour, serve and trust, And though the musicke of my verse, Be plainsong tune both true and just: Content thee yet to here my song, For els thou doest me doobble wrong. I must alledge, and thou canst tell How faithfully I vowed to serve, And howe thou seemest to like me well: And how thou saydest I did deserve, To be thy Lord, thy Knight, thy King. And how much more I list not sing. And canst thou now (thou cruell one) Condemne desert to deepe dispayre? Is all thy promise past and gone? Is fayth so fled into the ayre? If that be so, what rests for me? But thus in song to saye to thee. If Cressydes name were not so knowen, And written wide on every wall: If brute of pryde were not so blowen, Upon Angelica withall: For hault disdayne thou mightst be she, Angelica refusing the most famous knights in the whole worlde, chose at last Medoro a poore serving man. Or Cresside for inconstancie. And in reward of thy desart, I hope at last to see thee payd: With deepe repentaunce for thy part, Which thou hast now so lewedly playd. Medoro hee must bee thy make, Since thou Orlando doest for sake. Such is the fruite that groweth alwaies, Upon the roote of ripe disdaine: Such kindly wages Cupide payes, Where constant hearts cannot remaine, I hope to see thee in such bandes, When I may laugh and clappe my handes. But yet for thee I must protest, [That] sure the faulte is none of thine, Thou art as true as is the best, That ever came of Cressedes lyne: For constant yet was never none, But in unconstancie alone. Meritum peter, grave. Mars in despite of Vulcane written for an absent lover (parted from his Lady by Sea.) Both deepe and dreadfull were the Seas, Which held Leander from his love, Yet could no doubtes his mind appease, Nor save his life for hir behove: But guiltlesse bloud it selfe would spill, To please the waves and worke his wyll. O greedye gulfe, O wretched waves, O cruell floods, O sinke of shames, You holde true lovers bound like slaves, And keepe them from their worthy Dames: Your open mouth gapes evermore, Tyll one or both be drowned therefore. For proofe whereof my selfe maye sing, And shrich to pearce the loftye skies, Whose Lady left me languishing, Uppon the shoare in woofull wise. And crost the Seas out of my sight, Wherby I lost my chiefe delight. She sayd that no such trustlesse flood, Should keepe our loves (long time) in twayne: She sware no bread shoulde doe hyr good, Till she migh[t] see my selfe agayne. She sayd and swore these wordes and mo, But now I finde them nothing so. What resteth then for me to doo, Thou salte sea foome come saye thy mind? Should I come drowne within thee to, That am of true Leanders kind? And headlong cast this corpes of mine, Into th[ose] greedy guttes of thine. No cruel, but in spite of thee, I will make Seas where earst were none, My teares shall flowe in full degree, Tyll all my myrth may ebbe to mone. Into such droppes I meane to melt, And in such Seas my selfe to swelt. Lenvoie. Yet you deere Dame for whome I fade, Thus starving still in wretched state: Remember once your promise made, Performe it now though all to late. Come home to Mars who may you please, Let Vulcane bide beyond the Seas. Meritum petere, grave. Patience perforce, wherein an absent lover doth thus encourage his Lady to continew constant. Content thy selfe with patience perforce: And quenche no love with droppes of darcke mistrust: Let absence have no power to divorce, Thy faithfull friend which meaneth to be just. Beare but a while thy constance to declare, For when I come one ynche shall breake no square. I must confesse that promise dyd me binde, For to have sene thy seemely selfe ere now: And if thou knewest what griefes did gaule my minde, Bicause I coulde not keepe that faithfull vowe, My just excuse, I can my selfe assure, With lytle paine thy pardon might procure. But call to minde how long Ulisses was, In lingring absence, from his loving make: And howe she deigned then hir dayes to passe, In solitary silence for his sake. Be thou a true Penelope to me, And thou shalt sone thine owne Ulisses see. What sayd I? sone? yea sone I saye againe, I wyll come sone and soner if I maye: Beleeve me nowe it is a pinching payne, To thinke of love, when lovers are awaye. Such thoughts I have, and when I thinke on thee, My thoughtes are there, whereas my bones would bee. The longing lust which Priames sonne of Troye, Had for to see his Cresside come againe: Could not exceede the depth of mine anoye, Nor seeme to passe the patterne of my payne. I fryse in hope, I thaw in hote desire, Farre from the flame, and yet I burne like fire. Wherfore deare friend, thinke on the pleasures past. And let my teares, for both our paines suffise: The lingring joyes, when as they come at last, Are bet then those, which passe in posting wise. And I my selfe, to prove this tale is true, In hast, post hast, thy comfort will renew. Meritum petere, grave. A letter devised for a yong lover. Receive you worthy Dame, this rude &amp; ragged verse, Lend wylling eare unto the tale, which I shall nowe rehearse. And though my witlesse woordes might moove you for to smile, Yet trust to that which I shal tel, &amp; never marke my stile. Amongst five hundreth Dames, presented to my view, I find most cause by due desert, to like the best of you. I see your beautie such, as seemeth to suffice, To binde my heart in linckes of love, by judgement of myne eyes. And but your bounty quench, the coales of quicke desire, I feare that face of yours wyll set, ten thousand hearts on fire. But bounty so aboundes, above al my desart, As that I quake and shrinke for feare, to shewe you of my smart. Yet since mine eye made choice, my hart shal not repent, But yeeld it self unto your wyl, &amp; therwith stand content. God knowth I am not great, my power it is not much, The greater glorye shall you gaine, to shew your favour suche. And what I am or have, all that I yeeld to you, My hande and sworde shall serve alwayes, to prove my tongue is true. Then take me for your owne, and so I wyl be still, Beleeve me nowe, I make this vowe, in hope of your good wyll. Which if I may obtaine, God leave me when I change, This is the tale I meant to tell, good Lady be not strange. Meritum petere, grave. Davids salutacions to Berzabe wherein are three sonets in sequence, written uppon this occation. The deviser hereof amongst other friendes had named a gentlewoman his Berzabe, and she was content to call him hir David. The man presented his Lady with a booke of the Golden Asse, written by Lucius Apuleius, and in the beginning of the booke wrote this sequence. You must conferre it with the Historye of Apuleius, for else it wyll have small grace. This Apuleius was in Affricke borne, And tooke delight to travaile Thessaly, As one that helde his native soyle in skorne, In foraine coastes to feede his fantasie. And such againe as wandring wits find out, This yonker wonne by wyll and weary toyle, A youth mispent, a doting age in doubt, A body brusd with many a beastly broyle, A presaunt pleasure passing on a pace, And paynting plaine the path of penitence, A frollicke favour foyld with fowle disgrace, When hoary heares should claime their reverence. Such is the fruite that growes on gadding trees, Such kynd of mell most moveth busie Bees. For Lucius he, Esteeming more one ounce of present sport, Than elders doe a pound of perfect wit: First to the bowre of beautie doth resorte, And there in pleasure passed many a fitte, His worthie race he (recklesse) doth forget, With small regarde in great affaires he reeles, No counsell grave, nor good advise can set His braynes in brake that whirled still on wheeles. For if Byrhena coulde have helde him backe, From Venus court where he nowe nusled was, His lustie limmes had never founde the lacke Of manlie shape: the figure of an Asse, Had not bene blazed on his bloud and bones, To wound his will with torments all attones. But Fotis she, Who sawe this Lording whitled with the cup Of vaine delight, wherof he gan to tast: Pourde out apace, and fillde the Mazor up, With drunken dole: yea after that in hast, She greazde this guest with sause of Sorcerie, And fedde his minde with knacks both queint and strange: Lo here the treazon and the trecherie Of gadding girles, when they delight to range. For Lucius thinking to become a foule, Became a foole, yea more than that, an Asse, A bobbing blocke, a beating stocke, an owle, Well woondred at in place where he did passe: And spent his time, his travaile and his cost, To purchase payne and all his labor lost. Yet I pore I, Who make of thee my Fotys and my frende, In like delight my youthfull yeares to spend: Do hope thou wilt from such soure sause defend, David thy King. Meritum petere grave. Soone acquainted, soone forgotten, As appeareth here by an uncourteous farewell to an inconstant Dame. If what you want, you (wanton) had at will, A stedfast minde, a faythfull loving heart: If what you speake you woulde performe it still, If from your worde your deede did not reverte: If youthfull yeares your thoughtes did not so rule, As elder dayes may scorne your friendship fraile, Your doubled fansie would not thus recule, For peevish pryde which nowe I must bewaile. For Cresside faire did Troilus never love, More deare than I esteemde your freamed cheare, Whose wavering wayes (since nowe I do them prove) By true reporte this witnesse with me beare: That if your friendship be not to deare bought, The price is great that nothing gives for nought.

      <field name="fulltext">[VOLUME II] The complaynt of Phylomene. Tam Marti, quàm Mercurio. To the right honorable, my singuler good Lord, the L. Gray of Wilton, Knight of the most noble order of the Garter. Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. PHILOMENE. In sweet April, the mess?ger to May When hoonie drops, do melt in golden showres, When every byrde, records hir lovers lay, And westerne windes, do foster forth our floures, Late in an even, I walked out alone, To heare the descant of the Nightingale, And as I stoode, I heard hir make great moane, Waymenting much, and thus she tolde hir tale. These thriftles birds (quoth she) which spend the day, In nedlesse notes, and chaunt withouten skil, Are costly kept, and finely fedde alway With daintie foode, wherof they feede their fil. But I which spend, the darke and dreadful night, In watch &amp; ward, wh? those birds take their rest, Forpine my selfe, that Lovers might delight, To heare the notes, which breake out of my breste. I leade a life, to please the Lovers minde, (And though god wot, my foode be light of charge, Yet seely soule, that can no favour finde) I begge my breade, and seke for seedes at large. The Throstle she, which makes the wood to ring With shryching lowde, that lothsome is to heare, Is costly kept, in cage: (O wondrous thing) The Mavis eke, whose notes are nothing cleare, Now in good sooth (quoth she) sometimes I wepe To see Tom Tyttimouse, so much set by. The Finche, which singeth never a note but peepe, Is fedde aswel, nay better farre than I. The Lennet and the Larke, they sing alofte, And coumpted are, as Lordes in high degree. The Brandlet saith, for singing sweete and softe, (In hir conceit) there is none such as she. Canara byrds, come in to beare the bell, And Goldfinches, do hope to get the gole: The tatling Awbe doth please some fancie wel, And some like best, the byrde as Blacke as cole. And yet could I, if so it were my minde, For harmony, set al these babes to schole, And sing such notes, as might in every kinde Disgrace them quight, &amp; make their corage coole. But should I so? no no so wil I not. Let brutish beasts, heare such brute birds as those (For like to like, the proverbe saith I wot) And should I then, my cunning skil disclose? For such unkinde, as let the cukowe flye, To sucke mine eggs, whiles I sit in the thicke? And rather praise, the chattring of a pye, Than hir that sings, with brest against a pricke? Nay let them go, to marke the cuckowes talke, The jangling Jay, for that becomes them wel. And in the silent night then let them walke, To heare the Owle, how she doth shryche and yel. And from henceforth, I wil no more constraine My pleasant voice, to sounde, at their request. But shrowd my selfe, in darkesome night &amp; raine, And learne to cowche, ful close upon my neast. Yet if I chaunce, at any time (percase) To sing a note, or twaine for my disporte, It shalbe done, in some such secret place, That fewe or none, may therunto resorte. These flatterers, (in love) which falshood meane, Not once aproch, to heare my pleasant song. But such as true, and stedfast lovers bene, Let them come neare, for else they do me wrong. And as I gesse, not many miles from hence, There stands a squire, with pangs of sorrow prest, For whom I dare, avowe (in his defence) He is as true, (in Love) as is the best. Him wil I cheare, with chaunting al this night: And with that word, she gan to cleare hir throate. But such a lively song (now by this light) Yet never hearde I such another note. It was (thought me) so pleasant and so plaine, Orphæus harpe, was never halfe so sweete, Tereu, Tereu, and thus she gan to plaine, Most piteously, which made my hart to greeve, Hir second note, was fy, fy, fy, fy, fy, And that she did, in pleasant wise repeate, With sweete reports, of heavenly harmonie, But yet it seemd, hir gripes of griefe were greate. For when she had, so soong and taken breath, Then should you heare, hir heavy hart so throbbe, As though it had bene, overcome with death, And yet alwayes, in every sigh and sobbe, She shewed great skil, for tunes of unisone, Hir Jug, Jug, Jug, (in griefe) had such a grace. Then stinted she, as if hir song were done. And ere that past, not ful a furlong space, She gan againe, in melodie to melt, And many a note, she warbled wondrous wel. Yet can I not (although my hart should swelt) Remember al, which hir sweete tong did tel. But one strange note, I noted with the rest And that saide thus: Nêmesis, Némesis, The which me thought, came boldly fro hir brest, As though she blamde, (therby) some thing amisse. Short tale to make, her singing sounded so, And pleasde mine eares, with such varietie, That (quite forgetting all the wearie wo, Which I my selfe felt in my fantasie) I stoode astoynde, and yet therwith content, Wishing in hart that (since I might advante, Of al hir speech to knowe the plaine entent, Which grace hirselfe, or else the Gods did graunt) I might therwith, one furder favor crave, To understand, what hir swete notes might meane. And in that thought, (my whole desire to have) I fell on sleepe, as I on staffe did leane. And in my slomber, had I such a sight, As yet to thinke theron doth glad my minde. Me thought I sawe a derling of delight, A stately Nimph, a dame of heavenly kinde. Whose glittring gite, so glimsed in mine eyes, As (yet) I not, what proper hew it bare, Ne therewithal, my wits can wel devise, To whom I might hir lovely lookes compare. But trueth to tel, (for al hir smyling cheere) She cast sometimes, a grievous frowning glance, As who would say: by this it may appeare, That Just revenge, is Prest for every chance, In hir right hand, (which to and fro did shake) She bare a skourge, with many a knottie string, And in hir left, a snaffle Bit or brake, Bebost with gold, and many a gingling ring: She came apace, and stately did she stay, And whiles I seemd, amazed very much, The courteous dame, these words to me did say: Sir Squire (quoth she) since thy desire is such, To understande, the notes of Phylomene, (For so she hight, whom thou calst Nightingale) And what the sounde, of every note might meane, Give eare a while, and hearken to my tale. The Gods are good, they heare the harty prayers, Of such as crave without a craftie wil, With favor eke, they furder such affaires, As tende to good, and meane to do none il. And since thy words, were grounded on desire, Wherby much good, and little harme can growe, They graunted have, the thing thou didst require, And lovingly, have sent me here bylowe, To paraphrase, the piteous pleasant notes, Which Phylomene, doth darkely spend in spring, For he that wel, Dan Nasoes verses notes, Shal finde my words to be no fained thing. Give eare (sir Squire quoth she) and I wil tel, Both what she was, and how hir fortunes fel. The fable of Philomela. In Athens reignde somtimes, A king of worthy fame, Who kept in courte a stately traine, Pandyon was his name. And had the Gods him given, No holly breade of happe, (I meane such fruts as make m? thinke They lye in fortunes lappe) Then had his golden giftes, Lyen dead with him in toombe, Ne but himselfe had none endurde, The daunger of his doome. But smyling lucke, bewitcht, This peerelesse Prince to thinke, That poyson cannot be conveyde In draughts of pleasant drinke. And kinde became so kind, That he two daughters had, Of bewtie such &amp; so well given, As made their father gladde. See: see: how highest harmes, Do lurke in ripest Joyes, How covertly doth sorow shrowde, In trymmest worldely toyes. These jewels of his joy, Became his cause of care, And bewtie was the guileful bayte, Which caught their lives in Snare. For Tereus Lord of Thrace, Bycause he came of kings, (So weddings made for worldly welth Do seme triumphant things) Was thought a worthy matche, Pandyons heire to wedde: Whose eldest daughter chosen was, To serve this king in bedde. That virgine Progne hight, And she by whom I meane, To tell this woful Tragedie, Was called Phylomene. The wedding rytes performde, The feasting done and past, To Thrace with his new wedded spouse He turneth at the last. Where many dayes in mirth, And jolytie they spent, Both satisfied with deepe delight, And cloyde with al content. At last the dame desirde Hir sister for to see, Such coles of kindely love did seme Within hir brest to be. She praies hir Lorde, of grace, He graunts to hir request, And hoist up saile, to seke the coaste, Where Phylomene doth rest. He past the foming seas, And findes the pleasant porte, Of Athens towne, which guided him To King Pandyons court. There: (lovingly receivde, And) welcomde by the king, He shewde the cause, which thither then Did his ambassade bring. His father him embrast, His sister kist his cheeke, In al the court his comming was Rejoyst of everie Greeke. Oh see the sweete deceit, Which blindeth worldly wits. How common peoples love by lumpes, And fancie comes by fits. The foe in friendly wise, Is many times embraste, And he which meanes most faith &amp; troth By grudging is disgrast. Faire Phylomene came forth In comely garments cladde, As one whom newes of sisters helth Had moved to be gladde, Or womans wil (perhappes) Enflamde hir haughtie harte, To get more grace by cr?mes of cost, And princke it out hir parte. Whom he no sooner sawe (I meane this Thracian prince) But streight therwith his fancies fume All reason did convince. And as the blazing bronde, Might kindle rotten reeds: Even so hir looke a secret flame, Within his bosome breedes. He thinkes al leysure long Til he (with hir) were gone, And hir he makes to move the mirth, Which after made hir mone. Love made him eloquent And if he cravde too much, He then excusde him selfe, and saide That Prognes words were such. His teares confirmed all Teares: like to sisters teares, As who shuld say by these fewe drops Thy sisters griefe appeares. So finely could he faine, That wickednesse seemde wit, And by the lawde of his pretence, His lewdnesse was acquit. Yea Phylomene set forth The force of his request, And cravde (with sighes) hir fathers leave To be hir sisters guest. And hoong about his necke And collingly him kist, And for hir welth did seke the woe Wherof she little wist. Meane while stoode Tereus, Beholding their affectes, And made those pricks (for his desire) A spurre in al respects. And wisht himselfe hir sire, When she hir sire embrast, For neither kith nor kin could then Have made his meaning chast. The Grecian king had not The powre for to denay, His own deare child, &amp; sonne in lawe The thing that both did pray. And downe his daughter falles, To thanke him on hir knee, Supposing that for good successe, Which hardest happe must be. But (least my tale seeme long,) Their shipping is preparde: And to the shore this aged Greeke, Ful princely did them guard. There (melting into mone) He usde this parting speech: Daughter (quoth he) you have desire Your sisters court to seech. Your sister seemes likewise, Your companie to crave, That crave you both, &amp; Tereus here The selfe same thing would have. Ne coulde I more withstande So many deepe desires, But this (quoth he) remember al Your father you requires, And thee (my sonne of Thrace,) I constantly conjure, By faith, by kin, by men, by gods, And al that seemeth sure, That father like, thou fende My daughter deare from scathe, And (since I counte al leasure long) Returne hir to me rathe. And thou my Phylomene, (Quoth he) come soone againe, Thy sisters absence puts thy syre, To too much privie paine. Herewith he kist hir cheeke, And sent a second kisse For Prognes part, and (bathde with teares) His daughter doth he blisse. And tooke the Thracyans hand For token of his truth, Who rather laught his teares to scorn, Than wept with him for ruth. The sayles are fully spredde, And winds did serve at will, And forth this traitour king conveies His praie in prison still. Ne could the Barbrous bloud, Conceale his filthy fyre, Hey: Victorie (quoth he) my shippe Is fraught with my desire. Wherewith he fixt his eyes, Uppon hir fearefull face. And stil behelde hir gestures all, And all hir gleames of grace. Ne could he loke a side, But like the cruel catte Which gloating casteth many a gl?ce Upon the selly ratte. Why hold I long discourse? They now are come on lande, And forth of ship the feareful wenche He leadeth by the hande Unto a selly shrowde, A sheepecote closely builte Amid the woodds, where many a l?b Their guiltlesse bloud had spilte, There (like a lambe,) she stoode, And askte with trimbling voice, Where Progne was, whose only sight Might make hir to rejoyce. Wherewith this caytife king His lust in lewdnesse lapt, And with his filthy fraude ful fast This simple mayde entrapt. And forth he floong the raines, Unbridling blinde desire, And ment of hir chast minde to make A fewel for his fire. And al alone (alone) With force he hir supprest, And made hir yelde the wicked weede Whose flowre he liked best. What could the virgine doe? She could not runne away, Whose forward feete, his harmfull hands With furious force did stay. Ahlas what should she fight? Fewe women win by fight: Hir weap?s were but weake (god knows) And he was much of might. It booted not to crie, Since helpe was not at hande, And stil before hir feareful face, Hir cruel foe did stande. And yet she (weeping cride) Uppon hir sisters name, Hir fathers, and hir brothers (oh) Whose facte did foyle hir fame. And on the Gods she calde, For helpe in hir distresse, But al in vaine he wrought his wil Whose lust was not the lesse. The filthie fact once done, He gave hir leave to greete, And there she sat much like a birde New scapte from falcons feete. Whose blood embrues hir selfe, And sitts in sorie plight, Ne dare she proine hir plumes again, But feares a second flight. At last when hart came home, Discheveld as she sate, With hands uphelde, she tried hir tongue, To wreake hir woful state. O Barbrous blood (quoth she) By Barbarous deeds disgrast, Coulde no kinde coale, nor pitties sparke, Within thy brest be plaste? Could not my fathers hests Nor my most ruthful teares, My maydenhoode, nor thine owne yoke, Affright thy minde with feares? Could not my sisters love Once quench thy filthy lust? Thou foilst us al, and eke thy selfe, We griev'd, and thou unjust. By thee I have defilde My dearest sisters bedde By thee I compt the life but lost, Which too too long I ledde. By thee (thou Bigamus) Our fathers griefe must growe, Who daughters twain, (&amp; two too much) Uppon thee did bestowe. But since my faulte, thy facte, My fathers just offence, My sisters wrong, with my reproche, I cannot so dispence. If any Gods be good If right in heaven do raigne, If right or wrong may make revenge, Thou shalt be paide againe. And (wicked) doe thy wurst, Thou canst no more but kil: And oh that death (before this gilte) Had overcome my will. Then might my soule beneath, Have triumpht yet and saide, That though I died discontent, I livde and dide a mayde. Herewith hir swelling sobbes, Did tie hir tong from talke, Whiles yet the Thraci? tyrant (there) To heare these words did walke. And skornefully he cast At hir a frowning glaunce, Which made the mayde to strive for spech, And stertling from hir traunce, I wil revenge (quoth she) For here I shake off shame, And wil (my selfe) bewray this facte Therby to foile thy fame. Amidde the thickest throngs (If I have leave to go) I will pronounce this bloudie deede, And blotte thine honor so. If I in deserts dwel, The woods, my words shal heare, The holts, the hilles, the craggie rocks, Shall witnesse with me beare. I wil so fil the ayre With noyse of this thine acte, That gods and men in heaven and earth Shal note the naughtie facte. These words amazde the king, Conscience with choller strave, But rage so rackte his restles thought, That now he gan to rave. And from his sheath a knife Ful despratly he drawes, Wherwith he cut the guiltlesse tong Out of hir tender jawes. The tong that rubde his gall, The tong that tolde but truthe, The tong that movde him to be mad, And should have moved ruth. And from his hand with spight This trustie tongue he cast, Whose roote, and it (to wreake this wr?g) Did wagge yet wondrous fast. So stirres the serpents taile When it is cut in twaine, And so it seemes that weakest willes, (By words) would ease their paine. I blush to tell this tale, But sure best books say this: That yet the butcher did not blush Hir bloudy mouth to kisse. And ofte hir bulke embrast, And ofter quencht the fire, Which kindled had the furnace first, Within his foule desire. Not herewithal content, To Progne home he came, Who askt him streight of Philomene: He (fayning griefe for game,) Brust out in bitter teares, And sayde the dame was dead, And falsly tolde, what wery life Hir father (for hir) ledde. The Thracian Queene cast off Hir gold, and gorgeous weede, And drest in dole, bewailde hir death Whom she thought dead in deede. A sepulchre she builds (But for a living corse,) And praide the gods on sisters soule To take a just remorse: And offred sacrifice, To all the powers above. Ah traiterous Thracian Tereus, This was true force of love. The heavens had whirld aboute Twelve yeeres in order due And twelve times every flowre and plant, Their liveries did renew, Whiles Philomene full close In shepcote stil was clapt, Enforst to bide by stonie walles Which fast (in hold) hir hapt. And as those walles forbadde Hir feete by flight to scape, So was hir tong (by knife) restrainde, For to reveale this rape No remedie remaynde, But onely womans witte, Which sodainly in queintest chance, Can best it selfe acquit. And Miserie (amongst) Tenne thousand mischieves moe, Learnes pollicie in practises, As proofe makes men to knowe. With curious needle worke, A garment gan she make, Wherin she wrote what bale she bode, And al for bewties sake. This garment gan she give To trustie Servants hande, Who streight c?veid it to the queen Of Thracian Tirants lande. When Progne red the writ, (A wondrous tale to tell) She kept it close: though malice made Hir venging hart to swell. And did deferre the deede, Til time and place might serve, But in hir minde a sharpe revenge, She fully did reserve. O silence seldome seene, That women counsell keepe, The cause was this, she wakt hir wits And lullde hir tong on sleepe. I speake against my sex, So have I done before, But truth is truth, and muste be tolde Though daunger keepe the dore. The thirde yeres rytes renewed, Which Bacchus to belong, And in that night the queene prepares Revenge for al hir wrong. She (girt in Bacchus gite) With sworde hir selfe doth arme, With wreathes of vines about hir browes And many a needles charme. And forth in furie flings, Hir handmaides following fast, Until with hastie steppes she founde The shepecote at the last. There howling out aloude, As Bacchus priests do crie, She brake the dores, and found the place Where Philomene did lye. And toke hir out by force, And drest hir Bacchus like, And hid hir face with boughes and leaves (For being knowen by like.) And brought hir to hir house, But when the wretch it knewe, That now againe she was so neere To Tereus untrue. She trembled eft for dreade, And lookt like ashes pale. But Progne (now in privie place) Set silence al to sale, And tooke the garments off, Discovering first hir face, And sister like did lovingly Faire Phylomene embrace. There she (by shame abasht) Held downe hir weeping eyes, As who should say: Thy right (by me) Is reste in wrongful wise. And down on ground she falles, Which ground she kist hir fill, As witnesse that the filthie facte Was done against hir wil. And cast hir hands to heaven, In steede of tong to tell, What violence the lecher usde, And howe hee did hir quell. Wherewith the Queene brake off Hir piteous pearcing plainte, And sware with sworde (no teares) to venge The crafte of this constrainte. Or if (quoth she) there bee Some other meane more sure, More stearne, more stoute, than naked sword Some mischiefe to procure, I sweare by al the Gods, I shall the same embrace, To wreake this wrong with bloudie hande Uppon the king of Thrace. Ne will I spare to spende My life in sisters cause, In sisters? ah what saide I wretch? My wrong shall lende me lawes. I wil the pallace burne, With al the princes pelfe, And in the midst of flaming fire, Wil caste the king him selfe. I wil scrat out those eyes, That taught him first to lust, Or teare his tong from traitors throte, Oh that revenge were just. Or let me carve with knife, The wicked Instrument, Wherewith he, thee, and me abusde (I am to mischiefe bent.) Or sleeping let me seeke To sende the soule to hel, Whose barbarous bones for filthy force, Did seeme to beare the bel. These words and more in rage Pronounced by this dame, Hir little sonne came leaping in Which Itis had to name. Whose presence, could not please For (vewing well his face,) Ah wretch (quoth she) how like he groweth Unto his fathers grace. And therwithal resolvde A rare revenge in deede Wheron to thinke (without? words) My woful hart doth bleede. But when the lad lokt up, And cheerefully did smile, And hung about his mothers necke With easie weight therewhile, And kist (as children use) His angrie mothers cheeke, Hir minde was movde to much remorce And mad became ful meeke. Ne could she teares refrayne, But wept against hir will, Such tender rewth of innocence, Hir cruell moode did kill. At last (so furie wrought) Within hir brest she felt, That too much pitie made hir minde Too womanlike to melt, And saw hir sister sit, With heavy harte and cheere, And now on hir, and then on him, Full lowringly did leare, Into these words she brust (Quoth she) why flatters he? And why againe (with tong cut out) So sadly sitteth shee? He, mother, mother calles, She sister cannot say, That one in earnest doth lament, That other whines in plaie. Pandions line (quoth she) Remember stil your race, And never marke the subtil shewes Of any Soule in Thrace. You should degenerate, If right revenge you slake, More right revenge can never bee, Than this revenge to make. Al ill that may be thought, Al mischiefe under skies, Were piëtie compard to that Which Tereus did devise. She holds no longer hande, But (Tygrelike) she toke The little boy ful boistrously Who now for terror quooke A[n]d (craving mothers helpe,) She (mother) toke a blade, And in hir sonnes smal tender hart An open wound she made. The cruel dede dispatcht, Betwene the sisters twaine They tore in peces quarterly The corps which they had slaine. Some part, they hoong on hooks, The rest they laide to fire, And on the table caused it, Be set before the sire. And counterfaite a cause (As Grecians order then) That at such feasts (but onely one) They might abide no men. He knowing not their crafte, Sat downe alone to eate, And hungerly his owne warme bloud Devoured there for meate. His oversight was such, That he for Itis sent, Whose murdered members in his mawe, He privily had pent. No longer Progne then, Hir joy of griefe could hide, The thing thou seekst (ô wretch quoth she) Within thee doth abide. Wherwith (he waxing wroth And searching for his sonne) Came forth at length, fair Philomene By whom the griefe begonne, And (clokt in Bacchus copes, Wherwith she then was cladde,) In fathers bosom cast the head Of Itis selly ladde: Nor ever in hir life Had more desire to speake, Th? now: wherby hir madding mood Might al hir malice wreake. The Thracian prince stert up, Whose hart did boyle in brest, To feele the foode, and see the sawce, Which he could not disgest. And armed (as he was) He followed both the Greekes, On whom (by smarte of sword, and flame) A sharpe revenge he sekes. But when the heavenly benche, These bloudie deedes did see, And found that bloud still covits bloud And so none ende could be. They then by their forsight Thought meete to stinte the strife, And so restraind the murdring king, From sister and from wife. So that by their decree, The yongest daughter fledde Into the thicks, where covertly, A cloister life she ledde. And yet to ease hir woe, She worthily can sing, And as thou hearst, c? please the eares Of many men in spring. The eldest dame and wife A Swallowe was assignde, And builds in smoky chimney toppes And flies against the winde. The king him selfe condemnde, A Lapwing for to be, Who for his yong ones cries alwais, Yet never can them see. The lad a Pheasaunt cocke For his degree hath gaind, Whose blouddie plumes declare the bloud Wherwith his face was staind. An expo[si]tion of al such notes as the nightingale dot[h] commonly use to sing.But there to turne my tale, The which I came to tell, The yongest dame to forrests fled, And there is dampnde to dwell. And Nightingale now namde Which (Philomela hight) Delights for (feare of force againe) To sing alwayes by night. But when the sunne to west, Doth bende his weerie course, Then Phylomene records the rewth, Which craveth just remorse. 1 And for hir foremost note, Tereu Tereu, doth sing, Complaining stil uppon the name Of that false Thracian king. Much like the childe at schole With byrchen rodds sore beaten, If when he go to bed at night His maister chaunce to threaten, In every dreame he starts, And (ô good maister) cries, Even so this byrde uppon that name, Hir foremost note replies. Or as the red breast byrds, Whome prettie Merlynes hold Ful fast in foote, by winters night To fende themselves from colde: Though afterwards the hauke, For pitie let them scape, Yet al that day, they fede in feare, And doubte a second rape. And in the nexter night, Ful many times do crie, Remembring yet the ruthful plight Wherein they late did lye. Even so this selly byrde, Though now transformde in kinde, Yet evermore hir pangs forepast, She beareth stil in minde. And in hir foremost note, She notes that cruel name, By whom she lost hir pleasant speech And foiled was in fame. 2 Hir second note is fye, In Greeke and latine phy, In english fy, and every tong That ever yet read I. Which word declares disdaine, Or lothsome leying by Of any thing we tast, heare, touche, Smel, or beholde with eye. In tast, phy sheweth some sowre, In hearing, some discorde, In touch, some foule or filthy toye, In smel, some sent abhorde. In sight, some lothsome loke, And every kind of waie, This byword phy betokneth bad, And things to cast away. So that it semes hir well, Phy, phy, phy, phy, to sing, Since phy befytteth him so well In every kind of thing. Phy filthy lecher lewde, Phy false unto thy wife, Phy coward phy, (on womankinde) To use thy cruel knife. Phy for thou wert unkinde, Fye fierce and foule forsworne, Phy m?ster made of murdring mould Whose like was never borne. Phy agony of age, Phy overthrowe of youth, Phy mirrour of mischevousnesse, Phy, tipe of al untruth. Phy fayning forced teares, Phy forging fyne excuse, Phy perjury, fy blasphemy, Phy bed of al abuse. These phyes, and many moe, Pore Philomene may meane, And in hir selfe she findes percase, Some phy that was uncleane. For though his fowle offence, May not defended bee, Hir sister yet, and she transgrest, Though not so deepe as he. His doome came by deserte, Their dedes grewe by disdaine, But men must leave revenge to Gods, What wrong soever raigne. Then Progne phy for thee, Which kildst thine only child, Phy on the cruel crabbed hart Which was not movde with milde. Phy phy, thou close conveydst A secret il unsene, Where (good to kepe in councel close) Had putrifide thy splene. Phy on thy sisters facte, And phy hir selfe doth sing, Whose lack of tong nere toucht hir so As when it could not sting. Phy on us both saith she, The father onely faulted, And we (the father free therewhile) The selly sonne assalted. 3 The next note to hir phy Is Jug, Jug, Jug, I gesse, That might I leave to latynists By learning to expresse. Some commentaries make About it much adoe: If it should onely Jugum meane Or Jugulatór too. Some thinke that Jugum is The Jug, she jugleth so, But Jugulator is the word That doubleth al hir woe. For when she thinkes thereon, She beares them both in minde, Him, breaker of his bonde in bed, Hir, killer of hir kinde. As fast as furies force Hir thoughts on him to thinke, So fast hir conscience choks hir up, And wo to wrong doth linke. At last (by griefe constrainde) It boldely breaketh out, And makes the hollow woods to ring With Eccho round about. 4 Hir next most note (to note) I neede no helpe at al, For I my selfe the partie am On whom she then doth call. She calles on Némesis And Némesis am I, The Goddesse of al just revenge, Who let no blame go by. This bridle bost with gold, I beare in my left hande, To holde men backe in rashest rage, Until the cause be scand. And such as like that bitte And beare it willingly, May scape this scourge in my right hand Although they trode awry. But if they hold on head, And scorne to beare my yoke, Oft times they buy the rost ful deare, It smelleth of the smoke. This is the cause (sir Squire Quoth she) that Phylomene Doth cal so much upon my name, She to my lawes doth leane: She feeles a just revenge Of that which she hath done, Constrainde to use the day for night And makes the moone hir sunne. Ne can she now complaine, (Although she lost hir tong) For since that time, ne yet before, No byrde so swetely soong. That gift we Gods hir gave, To countervaile hir woe, I sat on bench in heaven my selfe When it was graunted so. And though hir foe be fledde, But whither knowes not she, And like hir selfe transformed eke A selly byrde to bee: On him this sharpe revenge The Gods and I did take, He neither can beholde his brats, Nor is belovde of make. As soone as coles of kinde Have warmed him to do The selly shift of dewties dole Which him belongeth to: His hen straight way him hates, And flieth farre him fro, And close conveis hir eggs from him, As from hir mortal foe. As sone as she hath hatcht, Hir little yong ones runne, For feare their dame should serve th? efte, As Progne had begonne. And rounde about the fields The furious father flies, To seke his sonne, and filles the ayre With loude lamenting cries. This lothsome life he leads, By our almightie dome, And thus sings she, where company But very seldome come. Now lest my faithful tale For fable should be taken, And thereupon my curtesie, By thee might be forsaken: Remember al my words, And beare them wel in minde, And make thereof a metaphore, So shalt thou quickly finde, Both profite and pastime, In al that I thee tel: I knowe thy skill wil serve therto, And so (quoth she) farewell. The author contineweth his discourse and c?cludeth.Wherewith (me thought) she flong so fast away, That scarce I could, hir seemely shaddow see. At last: my staffe (which was mine onely stay) Did slippe, and I, must needes awaked be, Against my wil did I (God knowes) awake, For willingly I could my selfe content, Seven dayes to sleepe for Philomelâs sake, So that my sleepe in such swete thoughts were spent. But you my Lord which reade this ragged verse, Forgive the faults of my so sleepy muse, Let me the heast of Némesis rehearse, For sure I see, much sense therof ensues. I seeme to see (my Lord) that lechers lust, Procures the plague, and vengaunce of the highest, I may not say, but God is good and just, Although he scourge the furdest for the nighest: The fathers fault lights sometime on the sonne, Yea foure discents it beares the burden stil, Whereby it falles (when vaine delight is done) That dole steppes in and wields the world at wil. O whoredom, whoredome, hope for no good happe, The best is bad that lights on lechery And (al wel weyed) he sits in Fortune's lappe, Which feeles no sharper scourge than beggery. You princes peeres, you comely courting knights, Which use al arte to marre the maidens mindes, Which win al dames with baite of fonde delights, Which bewtie force, to loose what bountie bindes: Thinke on the scourge that Némesis doth beare, Remember this, that God (although he winke) Doth see al sinnes that ever secret were. (Væ vobis) then which still in sinne do sinke. Gods mercy lends you brydles for desire, Hold backe betime, for feare you catch a foyle, The flesh may spurre to everlasting fire, But sure, that horse which tyreth like a roile, And lothes the griefe of his forgalded sides, Is better, much than is the harbrainde colte Which headlong runnes and for no bridle bydes, But huntes for sinne in every hil and holte. He which is single, let him spare to spil The flowre of force, which makes a famous man: Lest when he comes to matrimonies will, His fynest graine be burnt, and ful of branne. He that is yokte and hath a wedded wife, Be wel content with that which may suffyse, And (were no God) yet feare of worldly strife Might make him lothe the bed where Lays lies: For though Pandyons daughter Progne shee, Were so transformde into a fethered foule, Yet seemes she not withouten heires to be, Who (wrongde like hir) ful angrely can scoule, And beare in brest a right revenging mode, Til time and place, may serve to worke their will. Yea surely some, the best of al the broode (If they had might) with furious force would kil. But force them not, whose force is not to force. And way their words as blasts of blustring winde, Which comes ful calme, when stormes are past by course: Yet God above that c? both lose &amp; bynde, Wil not so soone appeased be therefore, He makes the male, of female to be hated, He makes the sire go sighing wondrous sore, Because the sonne of such is seldome rated. I meane the sonnes of such rash sinning sires, Are seldome sene to runne a ruly race. But plagude (be like) by fathers foule desires Do gadde a broade, and lacke the guide of grace. Then (Lapwinglike) the father flies about, And howles and cries to see his children stray, Where he him selfe (and no man better) mought Have taught his bratts to take a better way. Thus men (my Lord) be Metamorphosed, From seemely shape, to byrds, and ougly beastes: Yea bravest dames, (if they amisse once tredde) Finde bitter sauce, for al their pleasant feasts. They must at last condemned be to dwell In thickes unseene, in mewes for minyons made, Until at last, (if they can bryde it wel) They may chop chalke, and take some better trade. Beare with me (Lord) my lusting dayes are done, Fayre Phylomene forbad me fayre and flat To like such love, as is with lust begonne, The lawful love is best, and I like that. Then if you see, that (Lapwinglike) I chaunce, To leape againe, beyond my lawful reache, (I take hard taske) or but to give a glaunce, At bewties blase, for such a wilful breache, Of promise made, my Lord shal do no wrong, To say (George) thinke on Phylomelâes song.

The greeves or discommodities of lustie yowth. [THE FIRST SONGE.] [1] The griefe of joye, in worthie wise to write, That by the vice, the vertue might be founde, Requireth skyll, and cunning to endight./ First: skill to judge, of everie griefe the grounde, Then arte to tell, wherein menns joyes abownde./ My muse therefore (not causelesse) dreadeth blame, Whose arte and skill, (God knowes) long since were lame. 2 The wandring waies, of reckles ranging youth, Made will forgett, the little skill I had,/ And wanton rimes, whereof no frewte ensewth, Have made my style, (whiche never good was) badde/ Well maie I then, accompted be but madd, To take in hande, a worke so greate and grave, Withe those fewe tooles, which yet untoucht I have./ 3 But as the man, whiche serves his prentishoode, With Artisanes, whose cunning doth excell. Although his skill, be never halfe so good, As theirs hathe bene, whose brute did beare the bell: Yet will the worlde, expect he shulde doe well, And partely graunt, that he deserveth fame, Because his masters, were of worthie name; 4 EVEN so my selfe, (who sometyme bare the bookes, Of suche as weere, greate Clerkes and men of skill) Presume to thinke, that everie bodie lookes, I shulde be lyke, unto my teachers still And thereupon I venter my good will Yn barreyne verse, to doe the best I can, Lyke Chaucers boye, and Petrarks jorneyman. 5 You then: who reade, and rifle in my rimes, To seeke the rose, where nothing growes but thornes, Of curtesie, yet pardone hym which clymes, To purchase praise, although, he fynd but skornes/ non cuivis contigit adire CorinthumFull well wott you, that Corynth shoyng hornes Maie not be made, like everie noddies nose, No Buckler serves, to beare all kynde of blowes./ 6 But if some Englishe woorde, herein seme sweet, Let Chaucers name, exalted be therefore,/ Yf any verse, doe passe on ples?nt feet, The praise thereof, redownd to Petrarks lore/ Few words to use, yf either lesse or more, Be fownde herei[n], which seeme to merite fame, The lawde thereof, be to my Sovereigns name./ 7 Reproofe myne owne, for all that is amysse: And faults must swarme where little skill doth reigne./ Yet for my selfe, I can alledge but this: The mazed man, whome bewties blaze hath slaine, Dothe goe in greife, and yet perceyves no payne And they whome love hathe daunted withe delight, Fynd seldome fault, but thinke that all goeth right./ 8 My Seasicke braynes, are giddie with the gaze, Whiche fancie cast, at lovely lookes long since/ And forward still, I wander in the maze, Where sweete deceipt, my reason dothe convince/ Yet as I maie, (you see) my muze must mynce,/ Suche nyce conceiptes, as toomble in my hedd To please her minde, who knowes what life I ledde. 9 Such pottherbes growe, where fancie diggs y? soyle, And hott desire, bestowes the willing seede./ But what for that? more frewtles were his toyle, Whome any griefe, could make repent the deede, Which once (withe joye) his jolly thoughts did feede./ One sight of heaven, might make my mynde to dwell, Seven yeares (content) yn depth of darkesome hell. 10 There is a griefe, in everie kind of joye, That is my theame, and that I meane to prove./ And who were he, w?? woulde not drinck anoye, To tast thereby, the lightest dr?me of love? But whiles I dreame, yt better shall behove, To wake a brayde and take my woorke in hande Least Will be shent, when toyes (by trewth) are skande. 11 Then let me saie, that lyfe to man is lent, To dwell on earthe, in jollitie and joye./ But therewithall, yt seemes that god was bent, To visite man (in myrthe) withe much anoye./ Thes contraries, are trewthe/ and like no toye. For looke who list, and doubtles he shall finde, Some grudge of griefe in everie joyfull mynde./ 12 To passe with penn, the terror of the Twygg, Which maie torment, the blythest babe that lyves. Consider we, when youthe is waxen bigg, What lustie life, in deepe delight he drives./ Lett see the joyes, w?? God to yoonkers geves./ And first of all (from whence the rest enseweth) Beholde wee well, the joyes of lustie youthe. 13 Of lustie youthe, then lustily to treate, Yt is the very Mayemoone of delight/ When boldest bloodes, are full of wilfull heate, And joye to thinke, how longe they have to fight, In fancies feelde, before their lyfe take flight./ Synce he which latest, did the game begynne, Dothe longest hope, to lynger styll therein./ 14 “O greevous joy/ O neast of needeles myrthe,/ “Full little knowes, the yongest yet that was, “How neare his death, approcheth to hys byrth/ “Suche wyngs hath tyme, w?? all things brings to passe./ “Her surest grounde, is slipperie as glasse./ “Nothing moore vayne, nor movable then youth, “Moore wylie none, then age: w?? still enseweth./ 15 For youthe cannot, stande still in one estate, But flieth us from, when most thereof is made/ And age steales on, unto our privy gate, And in y? darke, doth (silently) invade, Youthes fortte unwares: w?? never knewe y? trade./ So: when we thincke, age furthest from our lyfe, Youthes doore breakes up, and yt steppes in by strife. 16 This is one Griefe, yet (God he knowes) not greate, Compared to those, which follow youthfull joyes, “The reckles rage/ the rashe unbridled heate/ “The thirst of luste, to taste unlawfull toyes/ “The subtile snares, to catche content by coyes/ “The love/ the hate/ and all w?? lyfe dothe use, “Breeds griefe in joy, there is no choyse to chuse./ 17 I see not I: whereof yong men shoulde bost, Synce hee that is, nor fonde nor madd owtright, Dothe knowe y? adge, will come at last like frost, And nipp the flowere, of all his vaine delight,/ Where findes he then, the pleasure of his plight, “Alas alas, even whyles I write thes lynes, “So?e parte of youthe, to crooked age enclynes/ 18 Unlesse (percase) of two condempnd to death, The ladd w?? last, dothe clyme the gallow tree, (Because a while, he hath prolonged breath) Maie seeme (to so?e) the happier to be/ And yet who lyst, to harken unto me, I saie hee seemes, moore paine for to endure Which lyngers lyfe, and is to dye most sure./ 19 Yet this is not, an even comparisone./ For (here) that one, maie chance some waie to scape/ Where nought but death, when all delaies ar done, Can keepe olde age, from reaching youth by rape/ His hungrie Jawes, continually doe gape, To swallow youth: and yf death parte them not, Ytt needes at last must light unto his lott. 20 But so?e triumphe, asthough y? bounds were sett, How longe mans lyfe, might heere on earthe endure/ Put case it were, allowed w??owt lett, Full seventie yeares, to sojorne here full sure/ And then conclude/ that he (whiche hathe the cure, Of his owne Cource) might joye in youth full fast, And care in age, when lusty youthe were past./ 21 But therew??all, yt woulde be markt likewise, That as the Colt, which never knewe the bytt, Dothe soner catche, a knocke in wilfull wise, Then dothe the horsse, w?? flyngeth never a fytt, But is content, to let his rider sitt; Even so that age, w?? lavishe is of breath, Shall sonest light, upon the darte of deathe. 22 “For deathe is he, w?? rides and breakes us all/ “Some yong, some olde, some full of witt, some fonde/ “And such as strive, and thinck to make h? fall “He swylles them first, in depthe of surfeyts ponde, “And after tyes, them fast in agewes bonde./ “Untyll at last, he w?ne the wyldest wyll, “To lye alonge, and let hym spurre his fill. 23 Weighe well my woordes, no nearer neighbours be, Then lyfe and deathe, whose walls alwaies do touche For yf that one, for feare doe chaunce to flee, That other (straight) dothe never seme to gruch, But followes fast, and thinkes no paine to muche/ Yea when they seme, in sonder quite divorst They meete (unseene) althoughe they be not forst./ 24 “And what gaynes, he that dothe prolonge his daies, “But sorrowe, payne, care, Contecke, and unquiett? “As sorowe first, the saulce of woorldely waies./ “And payne, the price of roonnyng after riott./ “Care keepes the booke, wherein man writes his diett./ “Contecke comptrolles, his howshold everie howre, “And much unrest, Doth holde his strongest towre./ 25 Thes greeves ensue, the lymityng of lyfe/ Which (being weyed, in equall ballance to) Must needes be cause, of muche debate and strife, One man woulde lyve as fayne as another.Synce He loves lyfe/ as well as He can doe/ Saye one lyves longe: another asketh Who? And why not I (sayth he) unequall kynde, Who longe therefore, and yet in paynes am pyned? 26 So that (in deede) their vaunting is but vayne, Who thinke in youth; to carroll voyde of care/ No, no (God knowes) eche pleasure hathe his payne/ And frolicke youthe, must meete w?? sory fare/ Alwaies Dole is tied fast with Delight.“For thoughe delight, were formed in a gare, “Yet kynde (whiche knewe what worke she had in hand) “Tyed Dole thereto, withe everlasting band. 27 One thinks in yowthe, to floorishe evermore, Because olde age, is furdest from his heele/ And whyles therewith, he comforteth y? core The flower doth fade, whiche he dothe never feele/ And drowpingly, yt downe apace dothe reele/ Oh brittle Joy, withe sodaine griefe disgrast, Which soner partes, then yt can be embrast. 28 Another thinkes, his age to be unbroken, Because in youth, his glasse beginnes to roone/ Who never marks, that whiles y? worde was spoken, Some parte therof, is now bothe past and done/ “The strongest thryd, y? ever yet was sponne, “(Although it never come, in clothe nor list) “Is nockthrowen yet, even with y? spindles twyst. 29 “The heavens on highe perpetually doe move/ “By mynutes meale, the howre dothe steale awaie/ “By howres, the daie, by daies, the monethes remove/ “And then by monethes, the yeares as fast decaie/ “Yea, Virgills verse, and Tully, truth do saie, “That tyme flieth on, and never claps her wings, “But rides on clowdes, &amp; forward still she flinges. 30 Muche lyke to them, who (sitting in a shipp) Are borne forthright, and feele no footing sturr./ In silent sleepes, the tyme awaie dothe slipp./ Yt neither bawlethe (like a contrie curre) Nor standeth styll, to byde a hasty spurre/ tyme dothe discover all things But slily slydes, and never maketh noyse, And much bewrayes; with verie little voyce./ 31 So?e co?pt that lyfe, ascendethe stylle in youthe Whiche dothe (indeede) unto the pytt descend/ And oh that men, could see howe sone enseweth, The fatall clapp, which brings them to their ende/ For then: this lyfe, which God to them dothe lende, Woulde skarcely seme, so many wynters daies, As earst seemd yeares, to ende theire want? waies/ 32 What said I? daies? nay not so manie howres/ Not howres? no no/ soe many mynuts nott/ The bravest yowth, w?? floorisheth lyke flowres, Woulde thinck his hew, to be as sone forgott, As tender herbes, cut up to serve the pott./ “And then this lyfe, which he so thougt to clyme, “Woulde shew yt selfe, but toomblyng under tyme/ 33 Well: yett dece?pt, by lusty yowthe is spied, When as it cannot well avoyded be./ For vaine it were, with grave advise to guyde, The wilfull blynde, w?? wyll no danger see/ And though I be not olde, yet trust to me, “Youthe skornes the reade, of them w?? have best skill “Though (by defect) yt needeth councell still./ 34 Harde of beleefe/ and unexpert withall/ Rashe/ blynde/ yett bolde/ and setteth dang? light/ Soe that mee seemes, no teacher of them all, Maie better serve, to handle youthe aright, Then crooked age: w?? settith in theire sight, (Although they wynke, dissembling not to see) Bothe what they are, and what they ought to be./ 35 To tell a trewth, yf any yong man woulde, Geve eare to age, and harken sounde advise, That youthe might shine, &amp; glister bright as golde/ For then might he, eschew the toyes w?? tyse, To vaine delight, and perills of little price/ Yea then should he, eskape y? sandes hymselfe, And helpe his pheares, who grounded sit on shelfe/ 36 But youth is it, w?? many hathe beguyld, By setting joye, in vayne delightes to sale/ Whereas in deede, most comfort is compiled, In things w?? seeme, to be but bytter bale/ Marke well my woordes and trust unto my tale, “All is not golde, w?? glistereth faire and bright, “Nor all things good, w?? fairest seeme in sight. 37 “Trew joye cannot, in trifleng toyes consist/ “Nor happines, in joyes w?? soone decaie/ “Then looke on yowthe, and marke yt he y? list/ “Somtymes both borne and buried in a daye/ “Yea thoughe yt should, contynew (greene) alwaie, “I cannot finde, what joy therein doth grow, “Which is not staynd, w?? undertwiggs of wo./ 38 How many tymes, have I beheld the race, Of reckles youth, w?? sondrie greeves disgrast?

Finis. TAM Marti quam Mercurio. The vanities of Activityes. [THE FOURTHE SONGE.] [1] Ones in my lyfe, I saw a Bakers boye, Whiche went unto his Masters Fagott reeke, (Beare withe me Queene for telling suche a toye) Some sticks (by lyke) for Masters fyre to seeke/ One stycke he cutt, another sticke he breeke, So?e long, some shorte, so?e greate he tooke, so?e small, Tyll on his hedd the reeke fell downe and all./ 2 And there the Boye, lay grovlyng on the grownd, Withe many fagotts rownde abowt his backe/ But when he felt hymselfe w??owten wounde, He gan againe, some fagott sticks to cracke/ Att last his Master (doubting so?e such wracke) Came angrie owt, and chidd his boye awhyle, But afterwards, he turnd his frowne to smyle./ 3 My Boye (q? he) who badd the be so bolde, As for to plucke an olde howse on thy hedd? Thou showldest foresee, that fagott sticks do hold, Together fast, and seldome list to shedd/ Thow mightest have chanst, to bring a foole to bed, By jesting so withe suche well joyned geare, Touch one, styrr all, they lye so close yfeare./ 4 But since it was, in service of my selfe, And since thow soughtest, but fewell for my fyre, Bestirr thee now, packe up againe this pelfe/ None other penaunce, I of thee requyre/ The Boye was blythe, and had his deepe desire, For so his Master laught and were well pleased, His harme (thought he) was quyckly to be eased./ 5 So (peereles prynce) my selfe maye be the Boye, Whiche sought for styckes, amydd youre fagott reeke/ I thought to proyne some griefe from everie Joye, And for the same, I curiously dyd seeke/ But whiles at large, unpercially I speeke, Behold your Cowrte, comes headlong on a heape, And on my Muse, withe might and mayne they leape/ 6 In deede I shoulde have marked in my mynde, That vertues marche, in mydest betweene extreames/ And harde yt were the fall of faults to fynde, Withowt some shake, to fortunes better beames/ But laugh (good Queene) and (by those glistering gleames Of your bright eies) I vowe to sing so long, Tyll all youre cowrte be pleased withe my song. 7 To serve youre selfe, I tooke this woorke in hand, And ment to make, butt fewell for youre fyre/ I meane, I ment, to make abuses skand, That use of good, (therby) might clyme the higher/ And though my woords, maie move some mynds to Ire, Forgive me (Queene) and I will worke amayne, Tyll fancies fagotts, piled be agayne./ 8 Thus much I syng, because my playnesong note, Must yett be herd, much lowder then before, And I must cleare, my hoarce unpleasant throate, To make yow view, so?e vanities yet moore/ I must be bolde, (thoughe rudely) for to roore, That in all active quallityes, wee use, Some griefe unseene, the smoothest Joye ensewes./ 9 Now as the Captayne (w?? at one fyeld fought, Hathe happely ones gott the upper hande) Wyll at the next conflict, conduct in doubt, Least fortune turne, and overthrow his band, Even so my Muze dothe dread to come on sande, Although Shee ones, have sayled by the same/ “Tydes turne, wynds wane, and grudge comes aft? game. 10 For now my woords waxe generall and large, So large as leave, no pleasure free from payne/ A harde attempt, and yett an easie charge, To prove a trewth, whereas the case is playne/ And yf my Queene free hearing do me deigne, I hoope herselfe, will soone confesse withe me, That griefe maie growe, in all the joyes that be. 11 I graunt yong mynds, maye yowthfully delight, Yn sondrie sortes, of exercyse and sporte/ I graunt the meane, to heale a heavy spright, Ys myrthe and glee, where jolly guests resort/ I graunt that pastyme ys the lowly porte, Wherein mans mynde, maie shrewd yt selfe full oft, Whyle crewell cares, bestowe theire blasts alloft./ 12 But as the Bell, can hardly holde the hawke, From soaring sometymes when Shee list to gadd, Even so the mynde (whiche woontedly dothe walke, In fancies fields, most lyke a lusty ladd) Can seldome be, so bridled from the badd, But that delight, maie drawe one foote tofarre, Whils vayne excesse, the mery meane dothe marre./ 13 To prove this trew, who shall the game begynne?

Of all the wooes, that wanton worldlyngs weave, I finde not one more thrall to guylefull throngs Then is the moane, to Musicke that belongs “Synce mellyshe mowthes, can worst awaye w?? gall, “As highest clymes are most afearde to fall./ 15 Yn deede suche dynne appeasethe angrye mynds, And Melancholye, ys removed thereby/ Somtymes removed, somtymes encrease yt fynds, When madnes leades, the mowrnefulst moode awrye/ For Musicke waytes, and where yt can espye, Or moane, or myrthe, yt dothe theire hewmore feede, And what they dreamt, yt makes them doe yn deede./ 16 Sett me asyde, and harke to holly Syres, Whose dyverse doomes, maye skarce discusse y? doubt/ For Ambrose first the use thereof requires, Yn everie churche, and all the worlde abowt/ But Athanase, forbadd the same throughowt/ Att last came Austine, like a dreamyng Dadd, And dyed in doubt, yf it were good or badd./ 17 Yt is a trewth, and cannott be denyed, That Musicke styrres, so?e mynds to godly thought./ Yt is as trew, and hathe byn often tryed, That Musicke styrres, moe mynds to be but nought/ Yt maie be fownde, yf it be rightly sought, That Musicke makes mo mery myndes starke madd, Then secrete prayer sufferethe to be sadd./ 18 The Serpent tickleth whome she list to sting/ The Surgeon stroketh whome he meanes to strike,/ The fowler whistleth whome he fayne would wryng, The Polipus (with colling) drawes in dike, The dazled wyghts whome she (to drowne) doth like/ And Musycke mufflethe many men withe Joye, Whose myrthe excesse, turnes quickly to anoy. 19 Amongst the vaynes, of variable Joyes, I must confesse, that Musicke pleasd me ones But whiles I searcht, the semyquaver toyes, The gl?ncing sharpes, the halfe notes for the nones; And all that serves, to grace owre gladsome grones; I founde a flatt, of follye owt of frame, Whiche made me graunt my Musicke was but lame. 20 I meane I fownde, that (ravished thereby) My wandring mynde, sometyme forgott yt selfe/ And reason ranne, his cowrce so farr awrye, That ere I wyst, my wytts were sett on shelfe Of trothe my braynes, so full were of suche pelfe, That so?e reporte, contynually dyd ryng Within myne eares, and made me seeme to singe. 21 I coulde not reade, but I must tune my words/ I coulde not speake, but as yt were by note/ I coulde not muze[, but] that I thought some byrds, With[in] my brest did rellease all by rote/ I coulde not praye, but eare there past my throte, Fyve faithefull boones to God for my request, I soonge the Syxth, and quyte forgott the rest./ 22 Laughe nott (sweete Queene) for I shall not be founde, The onely man, whiche (sleping in delight,) Hathe alwaies dreamt, on Musickes silver sownde Some singe soe longe, tyll they bee madde owtright/ And thoughe the wise come seldome in suche plight/ “Yet Plato pleasd, in Musicke so to dreame, “He thought yt helpt, the rulyng of a realme. 23 And wonderfull, it is that Neroes mynde Which all the worlde (and more) coulde not suffize Was never seene, so playnely to be pynde, As Musicke set, the same before owre eyes/ Soe greate a kyng, to dye in hastie wyse, Ytt greeved hym nott: but that so sweete a synger, Shoulde dye so sone: that sorrowe seemde a stynger./ 24 And lyke the Swanne, he soong before his deathe/ Whiche maie suffise, to prove the tyckell trust, That can be buylt, upon our fading breathe/ Yt maye suffise to shewe that all oure lust, At last will leave us, yn the depthe of dust/ Yt serves to prove, that no man synges so sweete, As can eschewe, withe bytter deathe to meete./ 25 So?e spende muche tyme, in learning sweete consents On lute, on harpe, Cythren, and virginalls/ And so?e take paynes withe wyndy Instruments, As Fyfes and flutes, cornetts and such like calles/ Of whome the last, to follye more be thralles/ The first but wringe, theire fyngers owt of frame, But thes make mowthes, and shew a seemely shame./ 26 Att everye spowte, that stands abowt a Towre, Men maye beholde suche Gorgons in theire grace/ When paynters please, to make a thing seeme sowre, They portraye then, the forme of some suche face/ And yet owre owne, blynde judgements be so base, Wee thinke that Joye, to lende us some reliefe, Whiche we beholde, exprest and done w?? griefe./ 27 I dwell to longe, in Musickes copye holde, For nowe the dawncers come and call for rome/ Da?cyng. But had they bells, then might they be so bolde, To keepe the fyelde, and challenge all that co?e, Synce bells and babells, are alike to so?e,/ And sure I see, no neighbours any where, That were so meete, to lyve and dwell so neare./ 28 For da?ce allone, (I meane w??owt some noyse,) And that woulde seeme, a very madd mans parte/ But instruments, or Musycke of the voyce, Doe cover many suche fonde crymes by arte/ Soe that me thynks, they best maie make a marte./ Musicke yt selfe, a mery madbraynd toy, And da?cing sure, a madder kynde of joye./ 29 What shoulde I co?pt, oure tossings and oure turnes, Owre frysks, oure flyngs, and all owr motions made/ Butt fewell geven, unto the fyre whiche burnes, Within owr brests; whose flame can never fade? For when Dame nature yn mans mynde did wade/ And sawe fonde fancye occupye the place, She fury sent, to byd that Dame a base./ 30 And thence proceede, the movings w?? we make, As forward, backward, lefte hande turne, and right/ Upwards, and downewards, tyll owre hartes do quake/ And last of all, (to shew owre selves owtright) A turne on toe, must grace owre giddy spright, Untyll sometymes, we stoomble in the same, And fall downeright, to geve the gazers game./ 31 Dancyng delights, are like a whyrlyng wheele, Which turnethe mylls, or suche lyke frames abowt/ Yt takes no rest, as they doe restles reele/ Yt weares it selfe, as they doe owt of doubt/ And (yf my Muse be bolld to tell trewth mought) Thes tryppers strive, to throwe theire braynes awaye, As wheeles voyde water to the Da?es decaye./ 32 But dyd yt hurte theire owne myndes and no moe, The losse were light, and easie to be borne/ The gazers eyes, are ofte mysguyded soe, As makes a hornepype to begett a horne/ The mery night begetts a madder morne/ For he that (over night) did (syngle) trace, Can (shortely after) da?ce a dooble pace./ 33 The Matrones mynde leaves of her coomly looke, The mayde must mynce, and strive to streyne her feete,/ The bryde her selfe, forgetts her marriage booke, And learnes that daye, some lessons muche unmeete/ She learnes sometymes, to da?ce and turne in streete, When her brydgroome, had rather have her home, For bett nor worse, She shoulde (from hym) so rome./ 34 Were I commaunded, to defyne in fewe, What da?cyng is, and what consysts therein I should be bolde, my logycke thus to shew/ Da?cyng is first, a pors[u]yva?t for Synne, To tempt the best, that ever yet hathe bene/ A clenly clooke, to cover (often tymes) The slye pretence, of many subtyle crymes./ 35 Yn da?ce the hande, hathe libertye to touche, The eye to gaze, the arme for to embrace, Whiche (otherwhere) might gyve greate cause of gruch/ The exercyse, acquytts a blushing face, And lends muche leave, w?? much more tyme &amp; place/ The darksome nyght, sharpe enemye to shame, By candles light, betrayethe many a dame./ 36 But wherefore stand I thus upon this text? Whoso can da?ce as Scipio seemd to doe, Not wantonly, nor as his witts were vext, Nor mynsing fyne, like such as meane to woe, But withe suche grace, as love and malyce to, Might bothe co?end, and be afeard to blame, I saie da?ce so, and da?ce in Christ his name./ 37 But every Byrde, hathe not an Eagles eye, Nor all y? clyme, the Martren maie ensew/ My Queene (I graunt) dothe every vice defye, Her Dames lykewise offences do eschewe/ Theire da?cyng bydds all Idle thoughts adieu./ I ment not them, I meane but such as seeke, To breake my backe, w?? fancies fagott reeke. 38 And synce I must, leape lightly and away, Before the force, of all those fagotts fall, Amongst the leapers let me take my waye, Leaping, roonyng vaultyng &amp;c. &amp;c. And see whatt faults I fynde amongst them all/ Beleve me (Queene) what ever me befall, I will tell trewth, the devyll hymselfe to shame, Although therby I seeme to purchase blame./ 39 I wyll not spare to speake as Petrark spake, Who sayd that leapers (leape they never so well) Cannott withe Squyrells full compare (yett) make/ Nor he whose roo?yng alwaies w?nes the bell, Shall therein seeme, a hare (yet) to excell/ Nor he that vaults, or gambolds best in shape, Can coome abowt (yet) nymbly lyke an Ape./ 40 A lambe can leape, full lightly in his yowthe, Which afterwards, proves heavie heelde and slowe, For loompyshe age, the lightest ly?es ensewth,/ And (at an ynche) doth, followe where they goe/ Then he that ro?nes so fast, or leapeth so, Where wyll he light, but in the lappe of death? And (streynyng force) he seemes to shorten breath./ 41 For yf we co?pt, those pleasures worthy price, Whiche (in them selves) do purchase privy payne, Then might we prayse (as well) bothe cards and dyse, Whiche lyve by losse, and few (god knowes) y? gayne/ Thexample not unlyke: for bothe be vayne, That one playes pownds, and lacketh pence at length, That other streynes, and styll decreasethe strength./ 42 To see so?e one, sitt scratching of his hedde (Yea teare his bearde sometymes), when he hathe lost, Another chafing, tyll his cheekes be redd, And bothe waxe warme to co[?]tervayle theire cost/ To see the cardes and dyse abowt howse tost/ Tyll anger vex bothe father, k?ne, and brother: Ys it not madnes? sure it is none other./ 43 But lacke of other actyve quallyties, Ys cause that this shoulde be in place profest/ Then lett my Muse bestyrre her to devyse, The best that be, and lett thes others rest/ Wrastlyng.Wrastlyng is thought, meete for a martiall guest, And therefore seemes, defended from the blames, Which grow w?? griefe in other Joyfull games/ 44 Yet hee thatt marks what I have sayed before, Of leaping, ro?nyng, vaultyng, and suche lyke The same of this maie well be sayed and more, For here of two, that one must lye in dyke/ And yf therewithe he doe his fall dyslyke, From wrastlyng trycks, they fall to warlyke blowes, Suche earnest oft, in deepest dalliaunce growes/ 45 But ryding is, of nobles muche desired, Rydinge. And what can be brought in agaynst the same? Alas alas, my Muze must needes by tyred, To recken griefe in every kynde of game/ But trust me (Queene) I am not yet so lame, But that I can in ryding finde some fault, As earst I dyd in them which leape and vault./ 46 For sett asyde, the danger of a fall, (Which so maye cha?ce, that (woulde wee ride or no,) Agaynst owre wylles, at last wee must or shall, When withe a broken legg wee cannott goe) I can rehearce yett many myschieves mo, And sundry greeves, thatt &amp;c. &amp;c. Left. unperfect for feare of Horsmen/ TAm Marti quam Mercurio. COMMENDATORY VERSES GEORGE GASCOIGNE Squire in commendation of this booke. [To The French Littleton. A most easie, perfect and absolute way to learne the frenche tongue. 1566.] The pearle of price, which englishm? have sought So farre abrode, and cost them there so dere Is now founde out, within our contrey here And better cheape, amongst us may be bought I meane the frenche: that pearle of pleasant speeche Which some sought far, &amp; bought it with their lives With sickenesse some, yea some with bolts &amp; gyves But all with payne, this peerelesse pearle did seeche: Now Holyband (A frendly frenche in deede) Hath tane such payne, for everie english ease That here at home, we may this language learne: And for the price, he craveth no more meede But th?keful harts, to whome his perles may please Oh thank him th?, that so much thank doth earne. Tam Marti quam Mercurio. George Gascoigne, in the commendation of the noble Arte of Venerie. [To The Noble Arte of Venerie or Hunting. 1576.] As God himselfe declares, the life of man was lent, Bicause it should (with feare of him) in gladsome wise be spent. And Salomon doth say, that all the rest is vaine, Unlesse that myrth and merie cheere, may follow toile and paine. If that be so in deede, what booteth then to buylde High towers &amp; halles of stately port, to leave an unknown child? Or wherefore hoord we heapes of coyne and worldly wealth, Whiles therwithall that caytif care, c?mes creeping in by stelth? The needie neighbors grudge to see the rychman thryve, Such malice worldly mucke doth breede in every man alyve. Contention commes by coyne, and care doth contecke sew, And sodeine death by care is caught, all this you know is true. Since death is then the end, which all men seeke to flye, And yet are all men well aware, that Man is borne to dye, Why leade not men such lives, in quiet comely wise, As might with honest sport &amp; game, their worldly minds suffise? Amongst the rest, that game, which in this booke is taught, Doth seeme to yeld as much content, as may on earth be sought. And but my simple Muze, both myrth and meane mistake, It is a meane of as much mirth, as any sport can make. It occupies the mynde, which else might chaunce to muse On mischiefe, malice, filth and fraudes, that mortall men do use. And as for exercise, it seemes to beare the bell, Since by the same, mens bodies be, in health mainteyned well. It exercyseth strength, it exercyseth wit, And all the poars and sprites of Man, are exercised by it, It shaketh off all slouth, it presseth downe all pryde, It cheres the hart, it glads the eye, &amp; through the ears doth glyde. I might at large expresse how earely huntsmen ryse And leave the sluggish sleepe for such, as leachers lust devyse. How true they tread their steps, in exercises traine, Which frisking flings &amp; lightbraind leaps, may seeme always to staine. Howe appetite is bred (with health) in homely cates, While Surfet sits in vaine excesse, &amp; Banquet breeds debates. How cries of well mouthd hounds, do countervaile the cost, Which many a man (beyond his reach) on instruments hath lost. How setting of Relayes, may represent the skyll, Which souldiours use in Embushes, their furious foes to kyll. How Foxe and Badgerd both, make patterns (in their denne) Of Plotformes, Loopes, and Casamats, devisde by warlike men. How fighting out at Bay, of Hart, Bucke, Goate, or Bore, Declares the valiant Romains death, when might may do no more. How sight of such delights, doth scorne all common showes, Of Enterludes, of Tumblers tricks, of antikes, mocks, &amp; mowes. And how the nimble Hare, by turning in hir course, Doth plainly prove that Pollicie, sometime surpasseth force. The Venson not forgot, most meete for Princes dyshe: All these with more could I rehearse, as much as wit could wyshe. But let these few suffice, it is a Noble sport, To recreate the mindes of Men, in good and godly sort. A sport for Noble peeres, a sport for gentle bloods, The paine I leave for servants such, as beate the bushie woods To make their masters sport. Then let the Lords rejoyce, Let gentlemen beholde the glee, and take thereof the choyce. For my part (being one) I must needes say my minde, That Hunting was ordeyned first, for Men of Noble kinde. And unto them therefore, I recommend the same, As exercise that best bec?mes, their worthy noble name. Tam Marti quàm Mercurio. George Gascoigne To the reader of this Booke. [To Cardanus Comforte translated into Englishe. 1576.] To salve a sore, with oyntment, oyle, or balme, Deserves (no doubt) reward and thanke alwayes. With drogues or dr?mes, to cure a sickely qualme, Deserves (likewyse) a palme of perfect prayse: But when mens mindes, (with mothes of secret mone) Are frett and frownst: When cankerwormes of care, Consume the hart, tyll hope of health be gone, Then comfort craves, both thankes and prayses rare. For looke howmutch, the mynde of man surmountes, Our bloud and bones, whych are (indeede) but drosse, Somutch the wyse, that comfort most accoumptes, Whych helpes the hart whom tyringe troubles tosse. Then let this woorcke, due thankes, and prayses finde, Whose Text doth teach, true comfortes for the mynde. Tam Marti, quam Mercurio. A PROPHETICAL SONET of the same George Gascoine, upon the commendable travaile which Sir Humfrey Gilbert hath disclosed in this worke. Men praise Columbus for the passing skil Which he declared, in Cosmographie, And nam'd him first (as yet we cal him stil) The 2. Neptune, dubd by dignity. Americus Vesputius, for his paine, Neptune the 3. ful worthely was named, And Magellanus, by good right did gaine, Neptune the 4. ful fitly to be famed. But al those three, and al the world beside, Discovered not, a thing of more emprice, Then in this booke, is learnedly descride, By vertue of my worthie friendes device. Yf such successe, to him (as them) then fall, Neptune the 5. we justly may him call. Tam Marti quam Mercurio.</field>
