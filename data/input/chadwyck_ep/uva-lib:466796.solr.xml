      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I: POEMS POETICAL WORKS EASTER HOLIDAYS Verse 1st Hail! festal Easter that dost bring Approach of sweetly-smiling spring, When Nature's clad in green: When feather'd songsters through the grove With beasts confess the power of love And brighten all the scene. Verse 2nd Now youths the breaking stages load That swiftly rattling o'er the road To Greenwich haste away: While some with sounding oars divide Of smoothly-flowing Thames the tide All sing the festive lay. Verse 3rd With mirthful dance they beat the ground, Their shouts of joy the hills resound And catch the jocund noise: Without a tear, without a sigh Their moments all in transports fly Till evening ends their joys. Verse 4th But little think their joyous hearts Of dire Misfortune's varied smarts Which youthful years conceal: Thoughtless of bitter-smiling Woe Which all mankind are born to know And they themselves must feel. Verse 5th Yet he who Wisdom's paths shall keep And Virtue firm that scorns to weep At ills in Fortune's power, Through this life's variegated scene In raging storms or calm serene Shall cheerful spend the hour. Verse 6th While steady Virtue guides his mind Heav'n-born Content he still shall find That never sheds a tear: Without respect to any tide His hours away in bliss shall glide Like Easter all the year. 1787. DURA NAVIS To tempt the dangerous deep, too venturous youth, Why does thy breast with fondest wishes glow? No tender parent there thy cares shall sooth, No much-lov'd Friend shall share thy every woe. Why does thy mind with hopes delusive burn? Vain are thy Schemes by heated Fancy plann'd: Thy promis'd joy thou'lt see to Sorrow turn Exil'd from Bliss, and from thy native land. Hast thou foreseen the Storm's impending rage, When to the Clouds the Waves ambitious rise, And seem with Heaven a doubtful war to wage, Whilst total darkness overspreads the skies; Save when the lightnings darting wingéd Fate Quick bursting from the pitchy clouds between In forkéd Terror, and destructive state Shall shew with double gloom the horrid scene? Shalt thou be at this hour from danger free? Perhaps with fearful force some falling Wave Shall wash thee in the wild tempestuous Sea, And in some monster's belly fix thy grave; Or (woful hap!) against some wave-worn rock Which long a Terror to each Bark had stood Shall dash thy mangled limbs with furious shock And stain its craggy sides with human blood. Yet not the Tempest, or the Whirlwind's roar Equal the horrors of a Naval Fight, When thundering Cannons spread a sea of Gore And varied deaths now fire and now affright: The impatient shout, that longs for closer war, Reaches from either side the distant shores; Whilst frighten'd at His streams ensanguin'd far Loud on his troubled bed huge Ocean roars. What dreadful scenes appear before my eyes! Ah! see how each with frequent slaughter red, Regardless of his dying fellows' cries O'er their fresh wounds with impious order tread! From the dread place does soft Compassion fly! The Furies fell each alter'd breast command; Whilst Vengeance drunk with human blood stands by And smiling fires each heart and arms each hand. Should'st thou escape the fury of that day A fate more cruel still, unhappy, view. Opposing winds may stop thy luckless way, And spread fell famine through the suffering crew, Canst thou endure th' extreme of raging Thirst Which soon may scorch thy throat, ah! thoughtless Youth! Or ravening hunger canst thou bear which erst On its own flesh hath fix'd the deadly tooth? Dubious and fluttering 'twixt hope and fear With trembling hands the lot I see thee draw, Which shall, or sentence thee a victim drear, To that ghaunt Plague which savage knows no law: Or, deep thy dagger in the friendly heart, Whilst each strong passion agitates thy breast, Though oft with Horror back I see thee start, Lo! Hunger drives thee to th' inhuman feast. These are the ills, that may the course attend— Then with the joys of home contented rest— Here, meek-eyed Peace with humble Plenty lend Their aid united still, to make thee blest. To ease each pain, and to increase each joy— Here mutual Love shall fix thy tender wife, Whose offspring shall thy youthful care employ And gild with brightest rays the evening of thy Life. 1787. NIL PEJUS EST CAELIBE VITÂ [IN CHRIST'S HOSPITAL BOOK] I What pleasures shall he ever find? What joys shall ever glad his heart? Or who shall heal his wounded mind, If tortur'd by Misfortune's smart? Who Hymeneal bliss will never prove, That more than friendship, friendship mix'd with love. II Then without child or tender wife, To drive away each care, each sigh, Lonely he treads the paths of life A stranger to Affection's tye: And when from Death he meets his final doom No mourning wife with tears of love shall wet his tomb. III Tho' Fortune, Riches, Honours, Pow'r, Had giv'n with every other toy, Those gilded trifles of the hour, Those painted nothings sure to cloy: He dies forgot, his name no son shall bear To shew the man so blest once breath'd the vital air. 1787. SONNET TO THE AUTUMNAL MOON Mild Splendour of the various-vested Night! Mother of wildly-working visions! hail! I watch thy gliding, while with watery light Thy weak eye glimmers through a fleecy veil; And when thou lovest thy pale orb to shroud Behind the gather'd blackness lost on high; And when thou dartest from the wind-rent cloud Thy placid lightning o'er the awaken'd sky. Ah such is Hope! as changeful and as fair! Now dimly peering on the wistful sight; Now hid behind the dragon-wing'd Despair: But soon emerging in her radiant might She o'er the sorrow-clouded breast of Care Sails, like a meteor kindling in its flight. 1788. ANTHEM FOR THE CHILDREN OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL Seraphs! around th' Eternal's seat who throng With tuneful ecstasies of praise: O! teach our feeble tongues like yours the song Of fervent gratitude to raise— Like you, inspired with holy flame To dwell on that Almighty name Who bade the child of Woe no longer sigh, And Joy in tears o'erspread the widow's eye. Th' all-gracious Parent hears the wretch's prayer; The meek tear strongly pleads on high; Wan Resignation struggling with despair The Lord beholds with pitying eye; Sees cheerless Want unpitied pine, Disease on earth its head recline, And bids Compassion seek the realms of woe To heal the wounded, and to raise the low. She comes! she comes! the meek-eyed Power I see With liberal hand that loves to bless; The clouds of Sorrow at her presence flee; Rejoice! rejoice! ye Children of Distress! The beams that play around her head Thro' Want's dark vale their radiance spread: The young uncultur'd mind imbibes the ray, And Vice reluctant quits th' expected prey. Cease, thou lorn mother! cease thy wailings drear; Ye babes! the unconscious sob forego; Or let full Gratitude now prompt the tear Which erst did Sorrow force to flow. Unkindly cold and tempest shrill In Life's morn oft the traveller chill, But soon his path the sun of Love shall warm; And each glad scene look brighter for the storm! 1789. JULIA [IN CHRIST'S HOSPITAL BOOK] Medio de fonte leporum Surgit amari aliquid. Julia was blest with beauty, wit, and grace: Small poets lov'd to sing her blooming face. Before her altars, lo! a numerous train Preferr'd their vows; yet all preferr'd in vain, Till charming Florio, born to conquer, came And touch'd the fair one with an equal flame. The flame she felt, and ill could she conceal What every look and action would reveal. With boldness then, which seldom fails to move, He pleads the cause of Marriage and of Love: The course of Hymeneal joys he rounds, The fair one's eyes danc'd pleasure at the sounds. Nought now remain'd but ‘Noes’—how little meant! And the sweet coyness that endears consent. The youth upon his knees enraptur'd fell: The strange misfortune, oh! what words can tell? Tell! ye neglected sylphs! who lap-dogs guard, Why snatch'd ye not away your precious ward? Why suffer'd ye the lover's weight to fall On the ill-fated neck of much-lov'd Ball? The favourite on his mistress casts his eyes, Gives a short melancholy howl, and—dies. Sacred his ashes lie, and long his rest! Anger and grief divide poor Julia's breast. Her eyes she fixt on guilty Florio first: On him the storm of angry grief must burst. That storm he fled: he wooes a kinder fair, Whose fond affections no dear puppies share. 'Twere vain to tell, how Julia pin'd away: Unhappy Fair! that in one luckless day— From future Almanacks the day be crost!— At once her Lover and her Lap-dog lost. 1789. QUAE NOCENT DOCENT [IN CHRIST'S HOSPITAL BOOK] O! mihi praeteritos referat si Jupiter annos! Oh! might my ill-past hours return again! No more, as then, should Sloth around me throw Her soul-enslaving, leaden chain! No more the precious time would I employ In giddy revels, or in thoughtless joy, A present joy producing future woe. But o'er the midnight Lamp I'd love to pore, I'd seek with care fair Learning's depths to sound, And gather scientific Lore: Or to mature the embryo thoughts inclin'd, That half-conceiv'd lay struggling in my mind, The cloisters' solitary gloom I'd round. 'Tis vain to wish, for Time has ta'en his flight— For follies past be ceas'd the fruitless tears: Let follies past to future care incite. Averse maturer judgements to obey Youth owns, with pleasure owns, the Passions' sway, But sage Experience only comes with years. 1789. THE NOSE Ye souls unus'd to lofty verse Who sweep the earth with lowly wing, Like sand before the blast disperse— A Nose! a mighty Nose I sing! As erst Prometheus stole from heaven the fire To animate the wonder of his hand; Thus with unhallow'd hands, O Muse, aspire, And from my subject snatch a burning brand! So like the Nose I sing—my verse shall glow— Like Phlegethon my verse in waves of fire shall flow! Light of this once all darksome spot Where now their glad course mortals run, First-born of Sirius begot Upon the focus of the Sun— I'll call thee —! for such thy earthly name— What name so high, but what too low must be? Comets, when most they drink the solar flame Are but faint types and images of thee! Burn madly, Fire! o'er earth in ravage run, Then blush for shame more red by fiercer — outdone! I saw when from the turtle feast The thick dark smoke in volumes rose! I saw the darkness of the mist Encircle thee, O Nose! Shorn of thy rays thou shott'st a fearful gleam (The turtle quiver'd with prophetic fright) Gloomy and sullen thro' the night of steam:— So Satan's Nose when Dunstan urg'd to flight, Glowing from gripe of red-hot pincers dread Athwart the smokes of Hell disastrous twilight shed! The Furies to madness my brain devote— In robes of ice my body wrap! On billowy flames of fire I float, Hear ye my entrails how they snap? Some power unseen forbids my lungs to breathe! What fire-clad meteors round me whizzing fly! I vitrify thy torrid zone beneath, Proboscis fierce! I am calcined! I die! Thus, like great Pliny, in Vesuvius' fire, I perish in the blaze while I the blaze admire. 1789. TO THE MUSE Tho' no bold flights to thee belong; And tho' thy lays with conscious fear, Shrink from Judgement's eye severe, Yet much I thank thee, Spirit of my song! For, lovely Muse! thy sweet employ Exalts my soul, refines my breast, Gives each pure pleasure keener zest, And softens sorrow into pensive Joy. From thee I learn'd the wish to bless, From thee to commune with my heart; From thee, dear Muse! the gayer part, To laugh with pity at the crowds that press Where Fashion flaunts her robes by Folly spun, Whose hues gay-varying wanton in the sun. 1789. DESTRUCTION OF THE BASTILE I Heard'st thou yon universal cry, And dost thou linger still on Gallia's shore? Go, Tyranny! beneath some barbarous sky Thy terrors lost and ruin'd power deplore! What tho' through many a groaning age Was felt thy keen suspicious rage, Yet Freedom rous'd by fierce Disdain Has wildly broke thy triple chain, And like the storm which Earth's deep entrails hide, At length has burst its way and spread the ruins wide. IV In sighs their sickly breath was spent; each gleam Of Hope had ceas'd the long long day to cheer; Or if delusive, in some flitting dream, It gave them to their friends and children dear— Awaked by lordly Insult's sound To all the doubled horrors round, Oft shrunk they from Oppression's band While Anguish rais'd the desperate hand For silent death; or lost the mind's controll, Thro' every burning vein would tides of Frenzy roll. V But cease, ye pitying bosoms, cease to bleed! Such scenes no more demand the tear humane; I see, I see! glad Liberty succeed With every patriot virtue in her train! And mark yon peasant's raptur'd eyes; Secure he views his harvests rise; No fetter vile the mind shall know, And Eloquence shall fearless glow. Yes! Liberty the soul of Life shall reign, Shall throb in every pulse, shall flow thro' every vein! VI Shall France alone a Despot spurn? Shall she alone, O Freedom, boast thy care? Lo, round thy standard Belgia's heroes burn, Tho' Power's blood-stain'd streamers fire the air, And wider yet thy influence spread, Nor e'er recline thy weary head, Till every land from pole to pole Shall boast one independent soul! And still, as erst, let favour'd Britain be First ever of the first and freest of the free! ?1789. LIFE As late I journey'd o'er the extensive plain Where native Otter sports his scanty stream, Musing in torpid woe a Sister's pain, The glorious prospect woke me from the dream. At every step it widen'd to my sight— Wood, Meadow, verdant Hill, and dreary Steep, Following in quick succession of delight,— Till all—at once—did my eye ravish'd sweep! May this (I cried) my course through Life portray! New scenes of Wisdom may each step display, And Knowledge open as my days advance! Till what time Death shall pour the undarken'd ray, My eye shall dart thro' infinite expanse, And thought suspended lie in Rapture's blissful trance. 1789. PROGRESS OF VICE [Nemo repente turpissimus] Deep in the gulph of Vice and Woe Leaps Man at once with headlong throw? Him inborn Truth and Virtue guide, Whose guards are Shame and conscious Pride. In some gay hour Vice steals into the breast; Perchance she wears some softer Virtue's vest. By unperceiv'd degrees she tempts to stray, Till far from Virtue's path she leads the feet away. Then swift the soul to disenthrall Will Memory the past recall, And Fear before the Victim's eyes Bid future ills and dangers rise. But hark! the Voice, the Lyre, their charms combine— Gay sparkles in the cup the generous Wine— Th' inebriate dance, the fair frail Nymph inspires, And Virtue vanquish'd—scorn'd—with hasty flight retires. But soon to tempt the Pleasures cease; Yet Shame forbids return to peace, And stern Necessity will force Still to urge on the desperate course. The drear black paths of Vice the wretch must try, Where Conscience flashes horror on each eye, Where Hate—where Murder scowl—where starts Affright! Ah! close the scene—ah! close—for dreadful is the sight. 1790. MONODY ON THE DEATH OF CHATTERTON [FIRST VERSION, IN CHRIST'S HOSPITAL BOOK—1790] Cold penury repress'd his noble rage, And froze the genial current of his soul. Now prompts the Muse poetic lays, And high my bosom beats with love of Praise! But, Chatterton! methinks I hear thy name, For cold my Fancy grows, and dead each Hope of Fame. When Want and cold Neglect had chill'd thy soul, Athirst for Death I see thee drench the bowl! Thy corpse of many a livid hue On the bare ground I view, Whilst various passions all my mind engage; Now is my breast distended with a sigh, And now a flash of Rage Darts through the tear, that glistens in my eye. Is this the land of liberal Hearts! Is this the land, where Genius ne'er in vain Pour'd forth her soul-enchanting strain? Ah me! yet Butler 'gainst the bigot foe Well-skill'd to aim keen Humour's dart, Yet Butler felt Want's poignant sting; And Otway, Master of the Tragic art, Whom Pity's self had taught to sing, Sank beneath a load of Woe; This ever can the generous Briton hear, And starts not in his eye th' indignant Tear? Elate of Heart and confident of Fame, From vales where Avon sports, the Minstrel came, Gay as the Poet hastes along He meditates the future song, How Ælla battled with his country's foes, And whilst Fancy in the air Paints him many a vision fair His eyes dance rapture and his bosom glows. With generous joy he views th' ideal gold: He listens to many a Widow's prayers, And many an Orphan's thanks he hears; He soothes to peace the care-worn breast, He bids the Debtor's eyes know rest, And Liberty and Bliss behold: And now he punishes the heart of steel, And her own iron rod he makes Oppression feel. Fated to heave sad Disappointment's sigh, To feel the Hope now rais'd, and now deprest, To feel the burnings of an injur'd breast, From all thy Fate's deep sorrow keen In vain, O Youth, I turn th' affrighted eye; For powerful Fancy evernigh The hateful picture forces on my sight. There, Death of every dear delight, Frowns Poverty of Giant mien! In vain I seek the charms of youthful grace, Thy sunken eye, thy haggard cheeks it shews, The quick emotions struggling in the Face Faint index of thy mental Throes, When each strong Passion spurn'd controll, And not a Friend was nigh to calm thy stormy soul. Such was the sad and gloomy hour When anguish'd Care of sullen brow Prepared the Poison's death-cold power. Already to thy lips was rais'd the bowl, When filial Pity stood thee by, Thy fixéd eyes she bade thee roll On scenes that well might melt thy soul— Thy native cot she held to view, Thy native cot, where Peace ere long Had listen'd to thy evening song; Thy sister's shrieks she bade thee hear, And mark thy mother's thrilling tear, She made thee feel her deep-drawn sigh, And all her silent agony of Woe. And from thy Fate shall such distress ensue? Ah! dash the poison'd chalice from thy hand! And thou had'st dash'd it at her soft command; But that Despair and Indignation rose, And told again the story of thy Woes, Told the keen insult of th' unfeeling Heart, The dread dependence on the low-born mind, Told every Woe, for which thy breast might smart, Neglect and grinning scorn and Want combin'd— Recoiling back, thou sent'st the friend of Pain To roll a tide of Death thro' every freezing vein. O Spirit blest! Whether th' eternal Throne around, Amidst the blaze of Cherubim, Thou pourest forth the grateful hymn, Or, soaring through the blest Domain, Enraptur'st Angels with thy strain,— Grant me, like thee, the lyre to sound, Like thee, with fire divine to glow— But ah! when rage the Waves of Woe, Grant me with firmer breast t'oppose their hate, And soar beyond the storms with upright eye elate! 1790. AN INVOCATION Sweet Muse! companion of my every hour! Voice of my Joy! Sure soother of the sigh! Now plume thy pinions, now exert each power, And fly to him who owns the candid eye. And if a smile of Praise thy labour hail (Well shall thy labours then my mind employ) Fly fleetly back, sweet Muse! and with the tale O'erspread my Features with a flush of Joy! 1790. ANNA AND HARLAND Within these wilds was Anna wont to rove While Harland told his love in many a sigh, But stern on Harland roll'd her brother's eye, They fought, they fell—her brother and her love! To Death's dark house did grief-worn Anna haste, Yet here her pensive ghost delights to stay; Oft pouring on the winds the broken lay— And hark, I hear her—'twas the passing blast. I love to sit upon her tomb's dark grass, Then Memory backward rolls Time's shadowy tide; The tales of other days before me glide: With eager thought I seize them as they pass; For fair, tho' faint, the forms of Memory gleam, Like Heaven's bright beauteous bow reflected in the stream. ?1790. TO THE EVENING STAR O meek attendant of Sol's setting blaze, I hail, sweet star, thy chaste effulgent glow; On thee full oft with fixéd eye I gaze Till I, methinks, all spirit seem to grow. O first and fairest of the starry choir, O loveliest 'mid the daughters of the night, Must not the maid I love like thee inspire Pure joy and calm Delight? Must she not be, as is thy placid sphere Serenely brilliant? Whilst to gaze a while Be all my wish 'mid Fancy's high career E'en till she quit this scene of earthly toil; Then Hope perchance might fondly sigh to join Her spirit in thy kindred orb, O Star benign! ?1790. PAIN Once could the Morn's first beams, the healthful breeze, All Nature charm, and gay was every hour:— But ah! not Music's self, nor fragrant bower Can glad the trembling sense of wan Disease. Now that the frequent pangs my frame assail, Now that my sleepless eyes are sunk and dim, And seas of Pain seem waving through each limb— Ah what can all Life's gilded scenes avail? I view the crowd, whom Youth and Health inspire, Hear the loud laugh, and catch the sportive lay, Then sigh and think—I too could laugh and play And gaily sport it on the Muse's lyre, Ere Tyrant Pain had chas'd away delight, Ere the wild pulse throbb'd anguish thro' the night! ?1790. ON A LADY WEEPING IMITATION FROM THE LATIN OF NICOLAUS ARCHIUS Lovely gems of radiance meek Trembling down my Laura's cheek, As the streamlets silent glide Thro' the Mead's enamell'd pride, Pledges sweet of pious woe, Tears which Friendship taught to flow, Sparkling in yon humid light Love embathes his pinions bright: There amid the glitt'ring show'r Smiling sits th' insidious Power; As some wingéd Warbler oft When Spring-clouds shed their treasures soft Joyous tricks his plumes anew, And flutters in the fost'ring dew. ?1790. MONODY ON A TEA-KETTLE O Muse who sangest late another's pain, To griefs domestic turn thy coal-black steed! With slowest steps thy funeral steed must go, Nodding his head in all the pomp of woe: Wide scatter round each dark and deadly weed, And let the melancholy dirge complain, (Whilst Bats shall shriek and Dogs shall howling run) The tea-kettle is spoilt and Coleridge is undone! Your cheerful songs, ye unseen crickets, cease! Let songs of grief your alter'd minds engage! For he who sang responsive to your lay, What time the joyous bubbles 'gan to play, The sooty swain has felt the fire's fierce rage;— Yes, he is gone, and all my woes increase; I heard the water issuing from the wound— No more the Tea shall pour its fragrant steams around! O Goddess best belov'd! Delightful Tea! With thee compar'd what yields the madd'ning Vine? Sweet power! who know'st to spread the calm delight, And the pure joy prolong to midmost night! Ah! must I all thy varied sweets resign? Enfolded close in grief thy form I see; No more wilt thou extend thy willing arms, Receive the fervent Jove, and yield him all thy charms! How sink the mighty low by Fate opprest!— Perhaps, O Kettle! thou by scornful toe Rude urg'd t' ignoble place with plaintive din, May'st rust obscure midst heaps of vulgar tin;— As if no joy had ever seiz'd my breast When from thy spout the streams did arching fly,— As if, infus'd, thou ne'er hadst known t' inspire All the warm raptures of poetic fire! But hark! or do I fancy the glad voice— ‘What tho' the swain did wondrous charms disclose— (Not such did Memnon's sister sable drest) Take these bright arms with royal face imprest, A better Kettle shall thy soul rejoice, And with Oblivion's wings o'erspread thy woes!’ Thus Fairy Hope can soothe distress and toil; On empty Trivets she bids fancied Kettles boil! 1790. GENEVIEVE Maid of my Love, sweet Genevieve! In Beauty's light you glide along: Your eye is like the Star of Eve, And sweet your voice, as Seraph's song Yet not your heavenly beauty gives This heart with Passion soft to glow: Within your soul a voice there lives! It bids you hear the tale of Woe. When sinking low the sufferer wan Beholds no hand outstretch'd to save, Fair, as the bosom of the Swan That rises graceful o'er the wave, I've seen your breast with pity heave, And therefore love I you, sweet Genevieve! 1789–90. ON RECEIVING AN ACCOUNT THAT HIS ONLY SISTER'S DEATH WAS INEVITABLE The tear which mourn'd a brother's fate scarce dry— Pain after pain, and woe succeeding woe— Is my heart destin'd for another blow? O my sweet sister! and must thou too die? Ah! how has Disappointment pour'd the tear O'er infant Hope destroy'd by early frost! How are ye gone, whom most my soul held dear! Scarce had I lov'd you ere I mourn'd you lost; Say, is this hollow eye, this heartless pain, Fated to rove thro' Life's wide cheerless plain— Nor father, brother, sister meet its ken— My woes, my joys unshared! Ah! long ere then On me thy icy dart, stern Death, be prov'd;— Better to die, than live and not be lov'd! 1791. ON SEEING A YOUTH AFFECTIONATELY WELCOMED BY A SISTER I too a sister had! too cruel Death! How sad Remembrance bids my bosom heave! Tranquil her soul, as sleeping Infant's breath; Meek were her manners as a vernal Eve. Knowledge, that frequent lifts the bloated mind, Gave her the treasure of a lowly breast, And Wit to venom'd Malice oft assign'd, Dwelt in her bosom in a Turtle's nest. Cease, busy Memory! cease to urge the dart; Nor on my soul her love to me impress! For oh I mourn in anguish—and my heart Feels the keen pang, th' unutterable distress. Yet wherefore grieve I that her sorrows cease, For Life was misery, and the Grave is Peace! 1791. A MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM If Pegasus will let thee only ride him, Spurning my clumsy efforts to o'erstride him, Some fresh expedient the Muse will try, And walk on stilts, although she cannot fly. To the Rev. George Coleridge Dear Brother, I have often been surprised that Mathematics, the quintessence of Truth, should have found admirers so few and so languid. Frequent consideration and minute scrutiny have at length unravelled the cause; viz. that though Reason is feasted, Imagination is starved; whilst Reason is luxuriating in its proper Paradise, Imagination is wearily travelling on a dreary desert. To assist Reason by the stimulus of Imagination is the design of the following production. In the execution of it much may be objectionable. The verse (particularly in the introduction of the ode) may be accused of unwarrantable liberties, but they are liberties equally homogeneal with the exactness of Mathematical disquisition, and the boldness of Pindaric daring. I have three strong champions to defend me against the attacks of Criticism: the Novelty, the Difficulty, and the Utility of the work. I may justly plume myself that I first have drawn the nymph Mathesis from the visionary caves of abstracted idea, and caused her to unite with Harmony. The first-born of this Union I now present to you; with interested motives indeed—as I expect to receive in return the more valuable offspring of your Muse. Thine ever, S. T. C. [Christ's Hospital], March 31, 1791. This is now—this was erst, Proposition the first—and Problem the first. I On a given finite line Which must no way incline; To describe an equi— —lateral Tri— —A, N, G, L, E. Now let A. B. Be the given line Which must no way incline; The great Mathematician Makes this Requisition, That we describe an Equi— —lateral Tri— —angle on it: Aid us, Reason—aid us, Wit! II From the centre A. at the distance A. B. Describe the circle B. C. D. At the distance B. A. from B. the centre The round A. C. E. to describe boldly venture. (Third postulate see.) And from the point C. In which the circles make a pother Cutting and slashing one another, Bid the straight lines a journeying go. C. A. C. B. those lines will show. To the points, which by A. B. are reckon'd, And postulate the second For Authority ye know. A. B. C. Triumphant shall be An Equilateral Triangle, Not Peter Pindar carp, nor Zoilus can wrangle. III Because the point A. is the centre Of the circular B. C. D. And because the point B. is the centre Of the circular A. C. E. A. C. to A. B. and B. C. to B. A. Harmoniously equal for ever must stay; Then C. A. and B. C. Both extend the kind hand To the basis, A. B. Unambitiously join'd in Equality's Band. But to the same powers, when two powers are equal, My mind forbodes the sequel; My mind does some celestial impulse teach, And equalises each to each. Thus C. A. with B. C. strikes the same sure alliance, That C. A. and B. C. had with A. B. before; And in mutual affiance None attempting to soar Above another, The unanimous three C. A. and B. C. and A. B. All are equal, each to his brother, Preserving the balance of power so true: Ah! the like would the proud Autocratrix do! At taxes impending not Britain would tremble, Nor Prussia struggle her fear to dissemble; Nor the Mah'met-sprung Wight The great Mussulman Would stain his Divan With Urine the soft-flowing daughter of Fright. IV But rein your stallion in, too daring Nine! Should Empires bloat the scientific line? Or with dishevell'd hair all madly do ye run For transport that your task is done? For done it is—the cause is tried! And Proposition, gentle Maid, Who soothly ask'd stern Demonstration's aid, Has proved her right, and A. B. C. Of Angles three Is shown to be of equal side; And now our weary steed to rest in fine, 'Tis rais'd upon A. B. the straight, the given line. 1791. HONOUR O, curas hominum! O, quantum est in rebus inane! The fervid Sun had more than halv'd the day, When gloomy on his couch Philedon lay; His feeble frame consumptive as his purse, His aching head did wine and women curse; His fortune ruin'd and his wealth decay'd, Clamorous his duns, his gaming debts unpaid, The youth indignant seiz'd his tailor's bill, And on its back thus wrote with moral quill: ‘Various as colours in the rainbow shown, Or similar in emptiness alone, How false, how vain are Man's pursuits below! Wealth, Honour, Pleasure—what can ye bestow? Yet see, how high and low, and young and old Pursue the all-delusive power of Gold. Fond man! should all Peru thy empire own, For thee tho' all Golconda's jewels shone, What greater bliss could all this wealth supply? What, but to eat and drink and sleep and die? Go, tempt the stormy sea, the burning soil— Go, waste the night in thought, the day in toil, Dark frowns the rock, and fierce the tempests rave— Thy ingots go the unconscious deep to pave! Or thunder at thy door the midnight train, Or Death shall knock that never knocks in vain. Next Honour's sons come bustling on amain; I laugh with pity at the idle train. Infirm of soul! who think'st to lift thy name Upon the waxen wings of human fame,— Who for a sound, articulated breath— Gazest undaunted in the face of death! What art thou but a Meteor's glaring light— Blazing a moment and then sunk in night? Caprice which rais'd thee high shall hurl thee low, Or Envy blast the laurels on thy brow. To such poor joys could ancient Honour lead When empty fame was toiling Merit's meed; To Modern Honour other lays belong; Profuse of joy and Lord of right and wrong, Honour can game, drink, riot in the stew, Cut a friend's throat;—what cannot Honour do? Ah me!—the storm within can Honour still For Julio's death, whom Honour made me kill? Or will this lordly Honour tell the way To pay those debts, which Honour makes me pay? Or if with pistol and terrific threats I make some traveller pay my Honour's debts, A medicine for this wound can Honour give? Ah, no! my Honour dies to make my Honour live. But see! young Pleasure, and her train advance, And joy and laughter wake the inebriate dance; Around my neck she throws her fair white arms, I meet her loves, and madden at her charms. For the gay grape can joys celestial move, And what so sweet below as Woman's love? With such high transport every moment flies, I curse Experience that he makes me wise; For at his frown the dear deliriums flew, And the changed scene now wears a gloomy hue. A hideous hag th' Enchantress Pleasure seems, And all her joys appear but feverous dreams. The vain resolve still broken and still made, Disease and loathing and remorse invade; The charm is vanish'd and the bubble's broke,— A slave to pleasure is a slave to smoke!’ Such lays repentant did the Muse supply; When as the Sun was hastening down the sky, In glittering state twice fifty guineas come,— His Mother's plate antique had rais'd the sum. Forth leap'd Philedon of new life possest:— 'Twas Brookes's all till two,—'twas Hackett's all the rest! 1791. ON IMITATION All are not born to soar—and ah! how few In tracks where Wisdom leads their paths pursue! Contagious when to wit or wealth allied, Folly and Vice diffuse their venom wide. On Folly every fool his talent tries; It asks some toil to imitate the wise; Tho' few like Fox can speak—like Pitt can think— Yet all like Fox can game—like Pitt can drink. ?1791. INSIDE THE COACH 'Tis hard on Bagshot Heath to try Unclos'd to keep the weary eye; But ah! Oblivion's nod to get In rattling coach is harder yet. Slumbrous God of half-shut eye! Who lovest with limbs supine to lie; Soother sweet of toil and care Listen, listen to my prayer; And to thy votary dispense Thy soporific influence! What tho' around thy drowsy head The seven-fold cap of night be spread, Yet lift that drowsy head awhile And yawn propitiously a smile; In drizzly rains poppean dews O'er the tired inmates of the Coach diffuse; And when thou'st charm'd our eyes to rest, Pillowing the chin upon the breast, Bid many a dream from thy dominions Wave its various-painted pinions, Till ere the splendid visions close We snore quartettes in ecstasy of nose. While thus we urge our airy course, O may no jolt's electric force Our fancies from their steeds unhorse, And call us from thy fairy reign To dreary Bagshot Heath again! 1791. DEVONSHIRE ROADS The indignant Bard composed this furious ode, As tired he dragg'd his way thro' Plimtree road! Crusted with filth and stuck in mire Dull sounds the Bard's bemudded lyre; Nathless Revenge and Ire the Poet goad To pour his imprecations on the road. Curst road! whose execrable way Was darkly shadow'd out in Milton's lay, When the sad fiends thro' Hell's sulphureous roads Took the first survey of their new abodes; Or when the fall'n Archangel fierce Dar'd through the realms of Night to pierce, What time the Bloodhound lur'd by Human scent Thro' all Confusion's quagmires floundering went. Nor cheering pipe, nor Bird's shrill note Around thy dreary paths shall float; Their boding songs shall scritch-owls pour To fright the guilty shepherds sore, Led by the wandering fires astray Thro' the dank horrors of thy way! While they their mud-lost sandals hunt May all the curses, which they grunt In raging moan like goaded hog, Alight upon thee, damnéd Bog! 1791. MUSIC Hence, soul-dissolving Harmony That lead'st th' oblivious soul astray— Though thou sphere-descended be— Hence away!— Thou mightier Goddess, thou demand'st my lay, Born when earth was seiz'd with cholic; Or as more sapient sages say, What time the Legion diabolic Compell'd their beings to enshrine In bodies vile of herded swine, Precipitate adown the steep With hideous rout were plunging in the deep, And hog and devil mingling grunt and yell Seiz'd on the ear with horrible obtrusion;— Then if aright old legendaries tell, Wert thou begot by Discord on Confusion! What though no name's sonorous power Was given thee at thy natal hour!— Yet oft I feel thy sacred might, While concords wing their distant flight. Such Power inspires thy holy son Sable clerk of Tiverton! And oft where Otter sports his stream, I hear thy banded offspring scream. Thou Goddess! thou inspir'st each throat; 'Tis thou who pour'st the scritch-owl note! Transported hear'st thy children all Scrape and blow and squeak and squall; And while old Otter's steeple rings, Clappest hoarse thy raven wings! 1791. SONNET ON QUITTING SCHOOL FOR COLLEGE Farewell parental scenes! a sad farewell! To you my grateful heart still fondly clings, Tho' fluttering round on Fancy's burnish'd wings Her tales of future Joy Hope loves to tell. Adieu, adieu! ye much-lov'd cloisters pale! Ah! would those happy days return again, When 'neath your arches, free from every stain, I heard of guilt and wonder'd at the tale! Dear haunts! where oft my simple lays I sang, Listening meanwhile the echoings of my feet, Lingering I quit you, with as great a pang, As when erewhile, my weeping childhood, torn By early sorrow from my native seat, Mingled its tears with hers—my widow'd Parent lorn. 1791. ABSENCE A FAREWELL ODE ON QUITTING SCHOOL FOR JESUS COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE Where graced with many a classic spoil Cam rolls his reverend stream along, I haste to urge the learnéd toil That sternly chides my love-lorn song: Ah me! too mindful of the days Illumed by Passion's orient rays, When Peace, and Cheerfulness and Health Enriched me with the best of wealth. Ah fair Delights! that o'er my soul On Memory's wing, like shadows fly! Ah Flowers! which Joy from Eden stole While Innocence stood smiling by!— But cease, fond Heart! this bootless moan: Those Hours on rapid Pinions flown Shall yet return, by Absence crown'd, And scatter livelier roses round. The Sun who ne'er remits his fires On heedless eyes may pour the day: The Moon, that oft from Heaven retires, Endears her renovated ray. What though she leave the sky unblest To mourn awhile in murky vest? When she relumes her lovely light, We bless the Wanderer of the Night. 1791. HAPPINESS On wide or narrow scale shall Man Most happily describe Life's plan? Say shall he bloom and wither there, Where first his infant buds appear; Or upwards dart with soaring force, And tempt some more ambitious course? Obedient now to Hope's command, I bid each humble wish expand, And fair and bright Life's prospects seem, While Hope displays her cheering beam, And Fancy's vivid colourings stream, While Emulation stands me nigh The Goddess of the eager eye. With foot advanc'd and anxious heart Now for the fancied goal I start:— Ah! why will Reason intervene Me and my promis'd joys between! She stops my course, she chains my speed, While thus her forceful words proceed:— ‘Ah! listen, Youth, ere yet too late, What evils on thy course may wait! To bow the head, to bend the knee, A minion of Servility, At low Pride's frequent frowns to sigh, And watch the glance in Folly's eye; To toil intense, yet toil in vain, And feel with what a hollow pain Pale Disappointment hangs her head O'er darling Expectation dead! ‘The scene is changed and Fortune's gale Shall belly out each prosperous sail. Yet sudden wealth full well I know Did never happiness bestow. That wealth to which we were not born Dooms us to sorrow or to scorn. Behold yon flock which long had trod O'er the short grass of Devon's sod, To Lincoln's rank rich meads transferr'd, And in their fate thy own be fear'd; Through every limb contagions fly, Deform'd and choked they burst and die. ‘When Luxury opens wide her arms, And smiling wooes thee to those charms, Whose fascination thousands own, Shall thy brows wear the stoic frown? And when her goblet she extends Which maddening myriads press around, What power divine thy soul befriends That thou should'st dash it to the ground?— No, thou shalt drink, and thou shalt know Her transient bliss, her lasting woe, Her maniac joys, that know no measure, And Riot rude and painted Pleasure;— Till (sad reverse!) the Enchantress vile To frowns converts her magic smile; Her train impatient to destroy, Observe her frown with gloomy joy; On thee with harpy fangs they seize The hideous offspring of Disease, Swoln Dropsy ignorant of Rest, And Fever garb'd in scarlet vest, Consumption driving the quick hearse, And Gout that howls the frequent curse, With Apoplex of heavy head That surely aims his dart of lead. ‘But say Life's joys unmix'd were given To thee some favourite of Heaven: Within, without, tho' all were health— Yet what e'en thus are Fame, Power, Wealth, But sounds that variously express, What's thine already—Happiness! 'Tis thine the converse deep to hold With all the famous sons of old; And thine the happy waking dream While Hope pursues some favourite theme, As oft when Night o'er Heaven is spread, Round this maternal seat you tread, Where far from splendour, far from riot, In silence wrapt sleeps careless Quiet. 'Tis thine with Fancy oft to talk, And thine the peaceful evening walk; And what to thee the sweetest are— The setting sun, the Evening Star— The tints, which live along the sky, And Moon that meets thy raptur'd eye, Where oft the tear shall grateful start, Dear silent pleasures of the Heart! Ah! Being blest, for Heaven shall lend To share thy simple joys a friend! Ah! doubly blest, if Love supply His influence to complete thy joy, If chance some lovely maid thou find To read thy visage in thy mind. ‘One blessing more demands thy care:— Once more to Heaven address the prayer: For humble independence pray The guardian genius of thy way; Whom (sages say) in days of yore Meek Competence to Wisdom bore, So shall thy little vessel glide With a fair breeze adown the tide, And Hope, if e'er thou 'ginst to sorrow, Remind thee of some fair to-morrow, Till Death shall close thy tranquil eye While Faith proclaims “Thou shalt not die!”’ 1791. A WISH WRITTEN IN JESUS WOOD, FEB. 10, 1792 Lo! through the dusky silence of the groves, Thro' vales irriguous, and thro' green retreats, With languid murmur creeps the placid stream And works its secret way. Awhile meand'ring round its native fields It rolls the playful wave and winds its flight: Then downward flowing with awaken'd speed Embosoms in the Deep! Thus thro' its silent tenor may my Life Smooth its meek stream by sordid wealth unclogg'd, Alike unconscious of forensic storms, And Glory's blood-stain'd palm! And when dark Age shall close Life's little day, Satiate of sport, and weary of its toils, E'en thus may slumbrous Death my decent limbs Compose with icy hand! 1792. AN ODE IN THE MANNER OF ANACREON As late, in wreaths, gay flowers I bound, Beneath some roses Love I found; And by his little frolic pinion As quick as thought I seiz'd the minion, Then in my cup the prisoner threw, And drank him in its sparkling dew: And sure I feel my angry guest Fluttering his wings within my breast! 1792. TO DISAPPOINTMENT Hence! thou fiend of gloomy sway, That lov'st on withering blast to ride O'er fond Illusion's air-built pride. Sullen Spirit! Hence! Away! Where Avarice lurks in sordid cell, Or mad Ambition builds the dream, Or Pleasure plots th' unholy scheme There with Guilt and Folly dwell! But oh! when Hope on Wisdom's wing Prophetic whispers pure delight, Be distant far thy cank'rous blight, Demon of envenom'd sting. Then haste thee, Nymph of balmy gales! Thy poet's prayer, sweet May! attend! Oh! place my parent and my friend 'Mid her lovely native vales. Peace, that lists the woodlark's strains, Health, that breathes divinest treasures, Laughing Hours, and Social Pleasures Wait my friend in Cambria's plains. Affection there with mingled ray Shall pour at once the raptures high Of filial and maternal Joy; Haste thee then, delightful May! And oh! may Spring's fair flowerets fade, May Summer cease her limbs to lave In cooling stream, may Autumn grave Yellow o'er the corn-cloath'd glade; Ere, from sweet retirement torn, She seek again the crowded mart: Nor thou, my selfish, selfish heart Dare her slow return to mourn! 1792. A FRAGMENT FOUND IN A LECTURE-ROOM Where deep in mud Cam rolls his slumbrous stream, And bog and desolation reign supreme; Where all Boeotia clouds the misty brain, The owl Mathesis pipes her loathsome strain. Far, far aloof the frighted Muses fly, Indignant Genius scowls and passes by: The frolic Pleasures start amid their dance, And Wit congeal'd stands fix'd in wintry trance. But to the sounds with duteous haste repair Cold Industry, and wary-footed Care; And Dulness, dosing on a couch of lead, Pleas'd with the song uplifts her heavy head, The sympathetic numbers lists awhile, Then yawns propitiously a frosty smile. . . . [Caetera desunt.] 1792. ODE Ye Gales, that of the Lark's repose The impatient Silence break, To yon poor Pilgrim's wearying Woes Your gentle Comfort speak! He heard the midnight whirlwind die, He saw the sun-awaken'd Sky Resume its slowly-purpling Blue: And ah! he sigh'd—that I might find The cloudless Azure of the Mind And Fortune's brightning Hue! Where'er in waving Foliage hid The Bird's gay Charm ascends, Or by the fretful current chid Some giant Rock impends— There let the lonely Cares respire As small airs thrill the mourning Lyre And teach the Soul her native Calm; While Passion with a languid Eye Hangs o'er the fall of Harmony And drinks the sacred Balm. Slow as the fragrant whisper creeps Along the lilied Vale, The alter'd Eye of Conquest weeps, And ruthless War grows pale Relenting that his Heart forsook Soft Concord of auspicious Look, And Love, and social Poverty; The Family of tender Fears, The Sigh, that saddens and endears, And Cares, that sweeten Joy. Then cease, thy frantic Tumults cease, Ambition, Sire of War! Nor o'er the mangled Corse of Peace Urge on thy scythéd Car. And oh! that Reason's voice might swell With whisper'd Airs and holy Spell To rouse thy gentler Sense, As bending o'er the chilly bloom The Morning wakes its soft Perfume With breezy Influence. 1792. A LOVER'S COMPLAINT TO HIS MISTRESS WHO DESERTED HIM IN QUEST OF A MORE WEALTHY HUSBAND IN THE EAST INDIES The dubious light sad glimmers o'er the sky: 'Tis silence all. By lonely anguish torn, With wandering feet to gloomy groves I fly, And wakeful Love still tracks my course forlorn. And will you, cruel Julia! will you go? And trust you to the Ocean's dark dismay? Shall the wide wat'ry world between us flow? And winds unpitying snatch my Hopes away? Thus could you sport with my too easy heart? Yet tremble, lest not unaveng'd I grieve! The winds may learn your own delusive art, And faithless Ocean smile—but to deceive! 1792. WITH FIELDING'S ‘AMELIA’ Virtues and Woes alike too great for man In the soft tale oft claim the useless sigh; For vain the attempt to realise the plan, On Folly's wings must Imitation fly. With other aim has Fielding here display'd Each social duty and each social care; With just yet vivid colouring portray'd What every wife should be, what many are. And sure the Parent of a race so sweet With double pleasure on the page shall dwell, Each scene with sympathizing breast shall meet, While Reason still with smiles delights to tell Maternal hope, that her loved progeny In all but sorrows shall Amelias be! ?1792. WRITTEN AFTER A WALK BEFORE SUPPER Tho' much averse, dear Jack, to flicker, To find a likeness for friend V—ker, I've made thro' Earth, and Air, and Sea, A Voyage of Discovery! And let me add (to ward off strife) For V?ker and for V—ker's Wife— She large and round beyond belief, A superfluity of beef! Her mind and body of a piece, And both composed of kitchen-grease. In short, Dame Truth might safely dub her Vulgarity enshrin'd in blubber! He, meagre bit of littleness, All snuff, and musk, and politesse; So thin, that strip him of his clothing, He'd totter on the edge of Nothing! In case of foe, he well might hide Snug in the collops of her side. Ah then, what simile will suit? Spindle-leg in great jack-boot? Pismire crawling in a rut? Or a spigot in a butt? Thus I humm'd and ha'd awhile, When Madam Memory with a smile Thus twitch'd my ear—‘Why sure, I ween, In London streets thou oft hast seen The very image of this pair: A little Ape with huge She-Bear Link'd by hapless chain together: An unlick'd mass the one—the other An antic small with nimble crupper—’ But stop, my Muse! for here comes supper. 1792. IMITATED FROM OSSIAN The stream with languid murmur creeps, In Lumin's flowery vale: Beneath the dew the Lily weeps Slow-waving to the gale. ‘Cease, restless gale!’ it seems to say, ‘Nor wake me with thy sighing! The honours of my vernal day On rapid wing are flying. ‘To-morrow shall the Traveller come Who late beheld me blooming: His searching eye shall vainly roam The dreary vale of Lumin.’ With eager gaze and wetted cheek My wonted haunts along, Thus, faithful Maiden! thou shalt seek The Youth of simplest song. But I along the breeze shall roll The voice of feeble power; And dwell, the Moon-beam of thy soul, In Slumber's nightly hour. 1793. THE COMPLAINT OF NINATHÓMA FROM THE SAME How long will ye round me be swelling, O ye blue-tumbling waves of the sea? Not always in caves was my dwelling, Nor beneath the cold blast of the tree. Through the high-sounding halls of Cathlóma In the steps of my beauty I strayed; The warriors beheld Ninathóma, And they blesséd the white-bosom'd Maid! A Ghost! by my cavern it darted! In moon-beams the Spirit was drest— For lovely appear the Departed When they visit the dreams of my rest! But disturb'd by the tempest's commotion Fleet the shadowy forms of delight— Ah cease, thou shrill blast of the Ocean! To howl through my cavern by night. 1793. SONGS OF THE PIXIES I Whom the untaught Shepherds call Pixies in their madrigal, Fancy's children, here we dwell: Welcome, Ladies! to our cell. Here the wren of softest note Builds its nest and warbles well; Here the blackbird strains his throat; Welcome, Ladies! to our cell. II When fades the moon to shadowy-pale, And scuds the cloud before the gale, Ere the Morn all gem-bedight Hath streak'd the East with rosy light, We sip the furze-flower's fragrant dews Clad in robes of rainbow hues; Or sport amid the shooting gleams To the tune of distant-tinkling teams, While lusty Labour scouting sorrow Bids the Dame a glad good-morrow, Who jogs the accustom'd road along, And paces cheery to her cheering song. III But not our filmy pinion We scorch amid the blaze of day, When Noontide's fiery-tresséd minion Flashes the fervid ray. Aye from the sultry heat We to the cave retreat O'ercanopied by huge roots intertwin'd With wildest texture, blacken'd o'er with age: Round them their mantle green the ivies bind, Beneath whose foliage pale Fann'd by the unfrequent gale We shield us from the Tyrant's mid-day rage. IV Thither, while the murmuring throng Of wild-bees hum their drowsy song, By Indolence and Fancy brought, A youthful Bard, ‘unknown to Fame,’ Wooes the Queen of Solemn Thought, And heaves the gentle misery of a sigh Gazing with tearful eye, As round our sandy grot appear Many a rudely-sculptur'd name To pensive Memory dear! Weaving gay dreams of sunny-tinctur'd hue, We glance before his view: O'er his hush'd soul our soothing witcheries shed And twine the future garland round his head. V When Evening's dusky car Crown'd with her dewy star Steals o'er the fading sky in shadowy flight; On leaves of aspen trees We tremble to the breeze Veil'd from the grosser ken of mortal sight. Or, haply, at the visionary hour, Along our wildly-bower'd sequester'd walk, We listen to the enamour'd rustic's talk; Heave with the heavings of the maiden's breast, Where young-eyed Loves have hid their turtle nest; Or guide of soul-subduing power The glance that from the half-confessing eye Darts the fond question or the soft reply. VI Or through the mystic ringlets of the vale We flash our faery feet in gamesome prank; Or, silent-sandal'd, pay our defter court, Circling the Spirit of the Western Gale, Where wearied with his flower-caressing sport, Supine he slumbers on a violet bank; Then with quaint music hymn the parting gleam By lonely Otter's sleep-persuading stream; Or where his wave with loud unquiet song Dash'd o'er the rocky channel froths along; Or where, his silver waters smooth'd to rest, The tall tree's shadow sleeps upon his breast. VII Hence thou lingerer, Light! Eve saddens into Night. Mother of wildly-working dreams! we view The sombre hours, that round thee stand With down-cast eyes (a duteous band!) Their dark robes dripping with the heavy dew. Sorceress of the ebon throne! Thy power the Pixies own, When round thy raven brow Heaven's lucent roses glow, And clouds in watery colours drest Float in light drapery o'er thy sable vest: What time the pale moon sheds a softer day Mellowing the woods beneath its pensive beam: For mid the quivering light 'tis ours to play, Aye dancing to the cadence of the stream. VIII Welcome, Ladies! to the cell Where the blameless Pixies dwell: But thou, Sweet Nymph! proclaim'd our Faery Queen, With what obeisance meet Thy presence shall we greet? For lo! attendant on thy steps are seen Graceful Ease in artless stole, And white-robed Purity of soul, With Honour's softer mien; Mirth of the loosely-flowing hair, And meek-eyed Pity eloquently fair, Whose tearful cheeks are lovely to the view, As snow-drop wet with dew. IX Unboastful Maid! though now the Lily pale Transparent grace thy beauties meek; Yet ere again along the impurpling vale, The purpling vale and elfin-haunted grove, Young Zephyr his fresh flowers profusely throws, We'll tinge with livelier hues thy cheek; And, haply, from the nectar-breathing Rose Extract a Blush for Love! 1793. THE ROSE As late each flower that sweetest blows I pluck'd, the Garden's pride! Within the petals of a Rose A sleeping Love I spied. Around his brows a beamy wreath Of many a lucent hue; All purple glow'd his cheek, beneath, Inebriate with dew. I softly seiz'd the unguarded Power, Nor scared his balmy rest: And placed him, caged within the flower, On spotless Sara's breast. But when unweeting of the guile Awoke the prisoner sweet, He struggled to escape awhile And stamp'd his faery feet. Ah! soon the soul-entrancing sight Subdued the impatient boy! He gazed! he thrill'd with deep delight! Then clapp'd his wings for joy. What charms this Throne endear! Some other Love let Venus find— I'll fix my empire here.’ 1793. KISSES Cupid, if storying Legends tell aright, Once fram'd a rich Elixir of Delight. A Chalice o'er love-kindled flames he fix'd, And in it Nectar and Ambrosia mix'd: With these the magic dews which Evening brings, Brush'd from the Idalian star by faery wings: Each tender pledge of sacred Faith he join'd, Each gentler Pleasure of th' unspotted mind— Day-dreams, whose tints with sportive brightness glow, And Hope, the blameless parasite of Woe. The eyeless Chemist heard the process rise, The steamy Chalice bubbled up in sighs; Sweet sounds transpired, as when the enamour'd Dove Pours the soft murmuring of responsive Love. The finish'd work might Envy vainly blame, And ‘Kisses’ was the precious Compound's name. With half the God his Cyprian Mother blest, And breath'd on Sara's lovelier lips the rest. 1793. THE GENTLE LOOK Thou gentle Look, that didst my soul beguile, Why hast thou left me? Still in some fond dream Revisit my sad heart, auspicious Smile! As falls on closing flowers the lunar beam: What time, in sickly mood, at parting day I lay me down and think of happier years; Of joys, that glimmer'd in Hope's twilight ray, Then left me darkling in a vale of tears. O pleasant days of Hope—for ever gone! Could I recall you!—But that thought is vain. Availeth not Persuasion's sweetest tone To lure the fleet-wing'd Travellers back again: Yet fair, though faint, their images shall gleam Like the bright Rainbow on a willowy stream. ?1793. SONNET TO THE RIVER OTTER Dear native Brook! wild Streamlet of the West! How many various-fated years have past, What happy and what mournful hours, since last I skimm'd the smooth thin stone along thy breast, Numbering its light leaps! yet so deep imprest Sink the sweet scenes of childhood, that mine eyes I never shut amid the sunny ray, But straight with all their tints thy waters rise, Thy crossing plank, thy marge with willows grey, And bedded sand that vein'd with various dyes Gleam'd through thy bright transparence! On my way, Visions of Childhood! oft have ye beguil'd Lone manhood's cares, yet waking fondest sighs: Ah! that once more I were a careless Child! ?1793. AN EFFUSION AT EVENING WRITTEN IN AUGUST, 1792 First Draft Imagination, Mistress of my Love! Where shall mine Eye thy elfin haunt explore? Dost thou on yon rich Cloud thy pinions bright Embathe in amber-glowing Floods of Light? Or, wild of speed, pursue the track of Day In other worlds to hail the morning Ray? 'Tis time to bid the faded shadowy Pleasures move On shadowy Memory's wings across the Soul of Love; And thine o'er Winter's icy plains to fling Each flower, that binds the breathing Locks of Spring, When blushing, like a bride, from primrose Bower She starts, awaken'd by the pattering Shower! Now sheds the setting Sun a purple gleam, Aid, lovely Sorc'ress! aid the Poet's dream. With faery wand O bid my Love arise, The dewy brilliance dancing in her Eyes; As erst she woke with soul-entrancing Mien The thrill of Joy extatic yet serene, When link'd with Peace I bounded o'er the Plain And Hope itself was all I knew of Pain! Propitious Fancy hears the votive sigh— The absent Maiden flashes on mine Eye! When first the matin Bird with startling Song Salutes the Sun his veiling Clouds among, I trace her footsteps on the steaming Lawn,accustom'd I view her glancing in the gleams of Dawn! When the bent Flower beneath the night-dew weeps And on the Lake the silver Lustre sleeps, Amid the paly Radiance soft and sad She meets my lonely path in moonbeams clad. With her along the streamlet's brink I rove; With her I list the warblings of the Grove; And seems in each low wind her voice to float, Lone-whispering Pity in each soothing Note! As oft in climes beyond the western Main Where boundless spreads the wildly-silent Plain, The savage Hunter, who his drowsy frame Had bask'd beneath the Sun's unclouded Flame, Awakes amid the tempest-troubled air, The Thunder's Peal and Lightning's lurid glare— Aghast he hears the rushing Whirlwind's Sweep, And sad recalls the sunny hour of Sleep! So lost by storms along Life's wild'ring Way Mine Eye reverted views that cloudless Day, When,—! on thy banks I joy'd to rove While Hope with kisses nurs'd the infant Love! Sweet—! where Pleasure's streamlet glides Fann'd by soft winds to curl in mimic tides; Where Mirth and Peace beguile the blameless Day; And where Friendship's fixt star beams a mellow'd Ray; Where Love a crown of thornless Roses wears; Where soften'd Sorrow smiles within her tears; And Memory, with a Vestal's meek employ, Unceasing feeds the lambent flame of Joy! No more thy Sky Larks less'ning from my sight Shall thrill th' attunéd heartstring with delight; No more shall deck thy pensive Pleasures sweet With wreaths of sober hue my evening seat! Yet dear to [My] Fancy's Eye thy varied scene Of Wood, Hill, Dale and sparkling Brook between: Yet sweet to [My] Fancy's Ear the warbled song, That soars on Morning's wing thy fields among! Scenes of my Hope! the aching Eye ye leave, Like those rich Hues that paint the clouds of Eve! Tearful and saddening with the sadden'd Blaze Mine Eye the gleam pursues with wistful Gaze— Sees Shades on Shades with deeper tint impend, Till chill and damp the moonless Night descend! 1792. LINES ON AN AUTUMNAL EVENING O thou wild Fancy, check thy wing! No more Those thin white flakes, those purple clouds explore! Nor there with happy spirits speed thy flight Bath'd in rich amber-glowing floods of light; Nor in yon gleam, where slow descends the day, With western peasants hail the morning ray! Ah! rather bid the perish'd pleasures move, A shadowy train, across the soul of Love! O'er Disappointment's wintry desert fling Each flower that wreath'd the dewy locks of Spring, When blushing, like a bride, from Hope's trim bower She leapt, awaken'd by the pattering shower. Now sheds the sinking Sun a deeper gleam, Aid, lovely Sorceress! aid thy Poet's dream! With faery wand O bid the Maid arise, Chaste Joyance dancing in her bright-blue eyes; As erst when from the Muses' calm abode I came, with Learning's meed not unbestowed; When as she twin'd a laurel round my brow, And met my kiss, and half return'd my vow, O'er all my frame shot rapid my thrill'd heart, And every nerve confess'd the electric dart. O dear Deceit! I see the Maiden rise, Chaste Joyance dancing in her bright-blue eyes! When first the lark high-soaring swells his throat, Mocks the tir'd eye, and scatters the loud note, I trace her footsteps on the accustom'd lawn, I mark her glancing mid the gleam of dawn. When the bent flower beneath the night-dew weeps And on the lake the silver lustre sleeps, Amid the paly radiance soft and sad, She meets my lonely path in moon-beams clad. With her along the streamlet's brink I rove; With her I list the warblings of the grove; And seems in each low wind her voice to float Lone-whispering Pity in each soothing note! Spirits of Love! ye heard her name! Obey The powerful spell, and to my haunt repair. Whether on clust'ring pinions ye are there, Where rich snows blossom on the Myrtle-trees, Or with fond languishment around my fair Sigh in the loose luxuriance of her hair; O heed the spell, and hither wing your way, Like far-off music, voyaging the breeze! Spirits! to you the infant Maid was given Form'd by the wond'rous Alchemy of Heaven! No fairer Maid does Love's wide empire know, No fairer Maid e'er heav'd the bosom's snow. A thousand Loves around her forehead fly; A thousand Loves sit melting in her eye; Love lights her smile—in Joy's red nectar dips His myrtle flower, and plants it on her lips. She speaks! and hark that passion-warbled song— Still, Fancy! still that voice, those notes prolong. As sweet as when that voice with rapturous falls Shall wake the soften'd echoes of Heaven's Halls! O (have I sigh'd) were mine the wizard's rod, Or mine the power of Proteus, changeful God! A flower-entangled Arbour I would seem To shield my Love from Noontide's sultry beam: Or bloom a Myrtle, from whose od'rous boughs My Love might weave gay garlands for her brows. When Twilight stole across the fading vale, To fan my Love I'd be the Evening Gale; Mourn in the soft folds of her swelling vest, And flutter my faint pinions on her breast! On Seraph wing I'd float a Dream by night, To soothe my Love with shadows of delight:— Or soar aloft to be the Spangled Skies, And gaze upon her with a thousand eyes! As when the Savage, who his drowsy frame Had bask'd beneath the Sun's unclouded flame, Awakes amid the troubles of the air, The skiey deluge, and white lightning's glare— Aghast he scours before the tempest's sweep, And sad recalls the sunny hour of sleep:— So tossed by storms along Life's wild'ring way, Mine eye reverted views that cloudless day, When by my native brook I wont to rove, While Hope with kisses nurs'd the Infant Love. Dear native brook! like Peace, so placidly Smoothing through fertile fields thy current meek! Dear native brook! where first young Poesy Stared wildly-eager in her noontide dream! Where blameless pleasures dimple Quiet's cheek, As water-lilies ripple thy slow stream! Dear native haunts! where Virtue still is gay, Where Friendship's fix'd star sheds a mellow'd ray, Where Love a crown of thornless Roses wears, Where soften'd Sorrow smiles within her tears; And Memory, with a Vestal's chaste employ, Unceasing feeds the lambent flame of joy! No more your sky-larks melting from the sight Shall thrill the attunéd heart-string with delight— No more shall deck your pensive Pleasures sweet With wreaths of sober hue my evening seat. Yet dear to Fancy's eye your varied scene Of wood, hill, dale, and sparkling brook between! Yet sweet to Fancy's ear the warbled song, That soars on Morning's wing your vales among. Scenes of my Hope! the aching eye ye leave Like yon bright hues that paint the clouds of eve! Tearful and saddening with the sadden'd blaze Mine eye the gleam pursues with wistful gaze: Sees shades on shades with deeper tint impend, Till chill and damp the moonless night descend 1793. TO FORTUNE To the Editor of the ‘Morning Chronicle’ Sir, —The following poem you may perhaps deem admissible into your journal—if not, you will commit it ??? ????? ????? ?????????.—I am, with more respect and gratitude than I ordinarily feel for Editors of Papers, your obliged, &amp;c. Cantab.—S. T. C. On buying a Ticket in the Irish Lottery Composed during a walk to and from the Queen's Head, Gray's Inn Lane, Holborn, and Hornsby's and Co., Cornhill. Promptress of unnumber'd sighs, O snatch that circling bandage from thine eyes! O look, and smile! No common prayer Solicits, Fortune! thy propitious care! For, not a silken son of dress, I clink the gilded chains of politesse, Nor ask thy boon what time I scheme Unholy Pleasure's frail and feverish dream; Nor yet my view life's dazzle blinds— Pomp!—Grandeur! Power!—I give you to the winds! Let the little bosom cold Melt only at the sunbeam ray of gold— My pale cheeks glow—the big drops start— The rebel Feeling riots at my heart! And if in lonely durance pent, Thy poor mite mourn a brief imprisonment— That mite at Sorrow's faintest sound Leaps from its scrip with an elastic bound! But oh! if ever song thine ear Might soothe, O haste with fost'ring hand to rear One Flower of Hope! At Love's behest, Trembling, I plac'd it in my secret breast: And thrice I've view'd the vernal gleam, Since oft mine eye, with Joy's electric beam, Illum'd it—and its sadder hue Oft moisten'd with the Tear's ambrosial dew! Poor wither'd floweret! on its head Has dark Despair his sickly mildew shed! But thou, O Fortune! canst relume Its deaden'd tints—and thou with hardier bloom May'st haply tinge its beauties pale, And yield the unsunn'd stranger to the western gale! 1793. PERSPIRATION. A TRAVELLING ECLOGUE The dust flies smothering, as on clatt'ring wheel Loath'd Aristocracy careers along; The distant track quick vibrates to the eye, And white and dazzling undulates with heat, Where scorching to the unwary traveller's touch, The stone fence flings its narrow slip of shade; Or, where the worn sides of the chalky road Yield their scant excavations (sultry grots!), Emblem of languid patience, we behold The fleecy files faint-ruminating lie. 1794. ON BALA HILL With many a weary step at length I gain Thy summit, Bala! and the cool breeze plays Cheerily round my brow—as hence the gaze Returns to dwell upon the journey'd plain. 'Twas a long way and tedious!—to the eye Tho' fair th' extended Vale, and fair to view The falling leaves of many a faded hue That eddy in the wild gust moaning by! Ev'n so it far'd with Life! in discontent Restless thro' Fortune's mingled scenes I went, Yet wept to think they would return no more! O cease fond heart! in such sad thoughts to roam, For surely thou ere long shalt reach thy home, And pleasant is the way that lies before. 1794. LINES WRITTEN AT THE KING'S ARMS, ROSS, FORMERLY THE HOUSE OF THE ‘MAN OF ROSS’ Richer than Miser o'er his countless hoards, Nobler than Kings, or king-polluted Lords, Here dwelt the Man of Ross! O Traveller, hear! Departed Merit claims a reverent tear. Friend to the friendless, to the sick man health, With generous joy he view'd his modest wealth; He heard the widow's heaven-breath'd prayer of praise, He mark'd the shelter'd orphan's tearful gaze, Or where the sorrow-shrivell'd captive lay, Pour'd the bright blaze of Freedom's noon-tide ray. Beneath this roof if thy cheer'd moments pass, Fill to the good man's name one grateful glass: To higher zest shall Memory wake thy soul, And Virtue mingle in the ennobled bowl. But if, like me, through Life's distressful scene Lonely and sad thy pilgrimage hath been; And if thy breast with heart-sick anguish fraught, Thou journeyest onward tempest-tossed in thought; Here cheat thy cares! in generous visions melt, And dream of Goodness, thou hast never felt! 1794. IMITATED FROM THE WELSH If while my passion I impart, You deem my words untrue, O place your hand upon my heart— Feel how it throbs for you! Ah no! reject the thoughtless claim In pity to your Lover! That thrilling touch would aid the flame It wishes to discover. ?1794. LINES TO A BEAUTIFUL SPRING IN A VILLAGE Once more! sweet Stream! with slow foot wandering near, I bless thy milky waters cold and clear. Escap'd the flashing of the noontide hours, With one fresh garland of Pierian flowers (Ere from thy zephyr-haunted brink I turn) My languid hand shall wreath thy mossy urn. For not through pathless grove with murmur rude Thou soothest the sad wood-nymph, Solitude; Nor thine unseen in cavern depths to well, The Hermit-fountain of some dripping cell! Pride of the Vale! thy useful streams supply The scatter'd cots and peaceful hamlet nigh. The elfin tribe around thy friendly banks With infant uproar and soul-soothing pranks, Releas'd from school, their little hearts at rest, Launch paper navies on thy waveless breast. The rustic here at eve with pensive look Whistling lorn ditties leans upon his crook, Or, starting, pauses with hope-mingled dread To list the much-lov'd maid's accustom'd tread: She, vainly mindful of her dame's command, Loiters, the long-fill'd pitcher in her hand. Unboastful Stream! thy fount with pebbled falls The faded form of past delight recalls, What time the morning sun of Hope arose, And all was joy; save when another's woes A transient gloom upon my soul imprest, Like passing clouds impictur'd on thy breast. Life's current then ran sparkling to the noon, Or silvery stole beneath the pensive Moon: Ah! now it works rude brakes and thorns among, Or o'er the rough rock bursts and foams along! 1794. IMITATIONS AD LYRAM (CASIMIR, BOOK II. ODE 3) The solemn-breathing air is ended— Cease, O Lyre! thy kindred lay! From the poplar-branch suspended Glitter to the eye of Day! On thy wires hov'ring, dying, Softly sighs the summer wind: I will slumber, careless lying, By yon waterfall reclin'd. In the forest hollow-roaring Hark! I hear a deep'ning sound— Clouds rise thick with heavy low'ring! See! th' horizon blackens round! Parent of the soothing measure, Let me seize thy wetted string! Swiftly flies the flatterer, Pleasure, Headlong, ever on the wing. 1794. TO LESBIA Vivamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus. Catullus. My Lesbia, let us love and live, And to the winds, my Lesbia, give Each cold restraint, each boding fear Of age and all her saws severe. Yon sun now posting to the main Will set,—but 'tis to rise again;— But we, when once our mortal light Is set, must sleep in endless night. Then come, with whom alone I'll live, A thousand kisses take and give! Another thousand!—to the store Add hundreds—then a thousand more! And when they to a million mount, Let confusion take the account,— That you, the number never knowing, May continue still bestowing— That I for joys may never pine, Which never can again be mine! ?1794. THE DEATH OF THE STARLING Lugete, O Veneres, Cupidinesque. —Catullus. Pity! mourn in plaintive tone The lovely starling dead and gone! Pity mourns in plaintive tone The lovely starling dead and gone. Weep, ye Loves! and Venus! weep The lovely starling fall'n asleep! Venus sees with tearful eyes— In her lap the starling lies! While the Loves all in a ring Softly stroke the stiffen'd wing. ?1794. MORIENS SUPERSTITI The hour-bell sounds, and I must go; Death waits—again I hear him calling;— No cowardly desires have I, Nor will I shun his face appalling. I die in faith and honour rich— But ah! I leave behind my treasure In widowhood and lonely pain;— To live were surely then a pleasure! My lifeless eyes upon thy face Shall never open more to-morrow; To-morrow shall thy beauteous eyes Be closed to Love, and drown'd in Sorrow; To-morrow Death shall freeze this hand, And on thy breast, my wedded treasure, I never, never more shall live;— Alas! I quit a life of pleasure. MORIENTI SUPERSTES Yet art thou happier far than she Who feels the widow's love for thee! For while her days are days of weeping, Thou, in peace, in silence sleeping, In some still world, unknown, remote, The mighty parent's care hast found, Without whose tender guardian thought No sparrow falleth to the ground. ?1794. THE SIGH When Youth his faery reign began Ere Sorrow had proclaim'd me man; While Peace the present hour beguil'd, And all the lovely Prospect smil'd; Then Mary! 'mid my lightsome glee I heav'd the painless Sigh for thee. And when, along the waves of woe, My harass'd Heart was doom'd to know The frantic burst of Outrage keen, And the slow Pang that gnaws unseen; Then shipwreck'd on Life's stormy sea I heaved an anguish'd Sigh for thee! But soon Reflection's power imprest A stiller sadness on my breast; And sickly Hope with waning eye Was well content to droop and die: I yielded to the stern decree, Yet heav'd a languid Sigh for thee! And though in distant climes to roam, A wanderer from my native home, I fain would soothe the sense of Care, And lull to sleep the Joys that were! Thy Image may not banish'd be— Still, Mary! still I sigh for thee. 1794. THE KISS One kiss, dear Maid! I said and sigh'd— Your scorn the little boon denied. Ah why refuse the blameless bliss? Can danger lurk within a kiss? Yon viewless wanderer of the vale, The Spirit of the Western Gale, At Morning's break, at Evening's close Inhales the sweetness of the Rose, And hovers o'er the uninjur'd bloom Sighing back the soft perfume. Vigour to the Zephyr's wing Her nectar-breathing kisses fling; And He the glitter of the Dew Scatters on the Rose's hue. Bashful lo! she bends her head, And darts a blush of deeper Red! Too well those lovely lips disclose The triumphs of the opening Rose; O fair! O graceful! bid them prove As passive to the breath of Love. In tender accents, faint and low, Well-pleas'd I hear the whisper'd ‘No!’ The whispered ‘No’—how little meant! Sweet Falsehood that endears Consent! For on those lovely lips the while Dawns the soft relenting smile, And tempts with feign'd dissuasion coy The gentle violence of Joy. ?1794. TO A YOUNG LADY WITH A POEM ON THE FRENCH REVOLUTION Much on my early youth I love to dwell, Ere yet I bade that friendly dome farewell, Where first, beneath the echoing cloisters pale, I heard of guilt and wonder'd at the tale! Yet though the hours flew by on careless wing, Full heavily of Sorrow would I sing. Aye as the Star of Evening flung its beam In broken radiance on the wavy stream, My soul amid the pensive twilight gloom Mourn'd with the breeze, O Lee Boo! o'er thy tomb. Where'er I wander'd, Pity still was near, Breath'd from the heart and glisten'd in the tear: No knell that toll'd but fill'd my anxious eye, And suffering Nature wept that one should die! Thus to sad sympathies I sooth'd my breast, Calm, as the rainbow in the weeping West: When slumbering Freedom roused by high Disdain With giant Fury burst her triple chain! Fierce on her front the blasting Dog-star glow'd; Her banners, like a midnight meteor, flow'd; Amid the yelling of the storm-rent skies! She came, and scatter'd battles from her eyes! Then Exultation waked the patriot fire And swept with wild hand the Tyrtaean lyre: Red from the Tyrant's wound I shook the lance, And strode in joy the reeking plains of France! Fallen is the Oppressor, friendless, ghastly, low, And my heart aches, though Mercy struck the blow. With wearied thought once more I seek the shade, Where peaceful Virtue weaves the Myrtle braid. And O! if Eyes whose holy glances roll, Swift messengers, and eloquent of soul; If Smiles more winning, and a gentler Mien Than the love-wilder'd Maniac's brain hath seen Shaping celestial forms in vacant air, If these demand the empassion'd Poet's care— If Mirth and soften'd Sense and Wit refined, The blameless features of a lovely mind; Then haply shall my trembling hand assign No fading wreath to Beauty's saintly shrine. Nor, Sara! thou these early flowers refuse— Ne'er lurk'd the snake beneath their simple hues; No purple bloom the Child of Nature brings From Flattery's night-shade: as he feels he sings. September 1794. TRANSLATION OF WRANGHAM'S ‘HENDECASYLLABI AD BRUNTONAM E GRANTA EXITURAM’ [KAL. OCT. MDCCXC] Maid of unboastful charms! whom white-robed Truth Right onward guiding through the maze of youth, Forbade the Circe Praise to witch thy soul, And dash'd to earth th' intoxicating bowl: Thee meek-eyed Pity, eloquently fair, Clasp'd to her bosom with a mother's care; And, as she lov'd thy kindred form to trace, The slow smile wander'd o'er her pallid face. For never yet did mortal voice impart Tones more congenial to the sadden'd heart: Whether, to rouse the sympathetic glow, Thou pourest lone Monimia's tale of woe; Or haply clothest with funereal vest The bridal loves that wept in Juliet's breast. O'er our chill limbs the thrilling Terrors creep, Th' entrancéd Passions their still vigil keep; While the deep sighs, responsive to the song, Sound through the silence of the trembling throng. But purer raptures lighten'd from thy face, And spread o'er all thy form an holier grace, When from the daughter's breasts the father drew The life he gave, and mix'd the big tear's dew. Nor was it thine th' heroic strain to roll With mimic feelings foreign from the soul: Bright in thy parent's eye we mark'd the tear; Methought he said, ‘Thou art no Actress here! A semblance of thyself the Grecian dame, And Brunton and Euphrasia still the same!’ O soon to seek the city's busier scene, Pause thee awhile, thou chaste-eyed maid serene, Till Granta's sons from all her sacred bowers With grateful hand shall weave Pierian flowers To twine a fragrant chaplet round thy brow, Enchanting ministress of virtuous woe! 1794. TO MISS BRUNTON WITH THE PRECEDING TRANSLATION That darling of the Tragic Muse, When Wrangham sung her praise, Thalia lost her rosy hues, And sicken'd at her lays: But transient was th' unwonted sigh; For soon the Goddess spied A sister-form of mirthful eye, And danc'd for joy and cried: ‘Meek Pity's sweetest child, proud dame, The fates have given to you! Still bid your Poet boast her name; I have my Brunton too.’ 1794. EPITAPH ON AN INFANT Ere Sin could blight or Sorrow fade, Death came with friendly care: The opening Bud to Heaven convey'd, And bade it blossom there. 1794. PANTISOCRACY No more my visionary soul shall dwell On joys that were; no more endure to weigh The shame and anguish of the evil day, Wisely forgetful! O'er the ocean swell Sublime of Hope, I seek the cottag'd dell Where Virtue calm with careless step may stray, And dancing to the moonlight roundelay, The wizard Passions weave an holy spell. Eyes that have ach'd with Sorrow! Ye shall weep Tears of doubt-mingled joy, like theirs who start From Precipices of distemper'd sleep, On which the fierce-eyed Fiends their revels keep, And see the rising Sun, and feel it dart New rays of pleasance trembling to the heart. 1794. ON THE PROSPECT OF ESTABLISHING A PANTISOCRACY IN AMERICA Whilst pale Anxiety, corrosive Care, The tear of Woe, the gloom of sad Despair, And deepen'd Anguish generous bosoms rend;— Whilst patriot souls their country's fate lament; Whilst mad with rage demoniac, foul intent, Embattled legions Despots vainly send To arrest the immortal mind's expanding ray Of everlasting Truth;—I other climes Where dawns, with hope serene, a brighter day Than e'er saw Albion in her happiest times, With mental eye exulting now explore, And soon with kindred minds shall haste to enjoy (Free from the ills which here our peace destroy) Content and Bliss on Transatlantic shore. 1794. ELEGY IMITATED FROM ONE OF AKENSIDE'S BLANK-VERSE INSCRIPTIONS [(No.) III.] Near the lone pile with ivy overspread, Fast by the rivulet's sleep-persuading sound, Where ‘sleeps the moonlight’ on yon verdant bed— O humbly press that consecrated ground! For there does Edmund rest, the learnéd swain! And there his spirit most delights to rove: Young Edmund! fam'd for each harmonious strain, And the sore wounds of ill-requited Love. Like some tall tree that spreads its branches wide, And loads the West-wind with its soft perfume, His manhood blossom'd; till the faithless pride Of fair Matilda sank him to the tomb. But soon did righteous Heaven her Guilt pursue! Where'er with wilder'd step she wander'd pale, Still Edmund's image rose to blast her view, Still Edmund's voice accus'd her in each gale. With keen regret, and conscious Guilt's alarms, Amid the pomp of Affluence she pined; Nor all that lur'd her faith from Edmund's arms Could lull the wakeful horror of her mind. Go, Traveller! tell the tale with sorrow fraught: Some tearful Maid perchance, or blooming Youth, May hold it in remembrance; and be taught That Riches cannot pay for Love or Truth. ?1794. THE FADED FLOWER Ungrateful he, who pluck'd thee from thy stalk, Poor faded flow'ret! on his careless way; Inhal'd awhile thy odours on his walk, Then onward pass'd and left thee to decay. Ah! melancholy emblem! had I seen Thy modest beauties dew'd with Evening's gem, I had not rudely cropp'd thy parent stem, But left thee, blushing, 'mid the enliven'd green And now I bend me o'er thy wither'd bloom, And drop the tear—as Fancy, at my side, Deep-sighing, points the fair frail Abra's tomb— ‘Like thine, sad Flower, was that poor wanderer's pride! Oh! lost to Love and Truth, whose selfish joy Tasted her vernal sweets, but tasted to destroy!’ 1794. THE OUTCAST Pale Roamer through the night! thou poor Forlorn! Remorse that man on his death-bed possess, Who in the credulous hour of tenderness Betrayed, then cast thee forth to Want and Scorn! The world is pitiless: the chaste one's pride Mimic of Virtue scowls on thy distress: Thy Loves and they that envied thee deride: And Vice alone will shelter Wretchedness! O! I could weep to think that there should be Cold-bosom'd lewd ones, who endure to place Foul offerings on the shrine of Misery, And force from Famine the caress of Love; May He shed healing on the sore disgrace, He, the great Comforter that rules above! ?1794. DOMESTIC PEACE [FROM ‘THE FALL OF ROBESPIERRE’, ACT I, L. 210] Tell me, on what holy ground May Domestic Peace be found? Halcyon daughter of the skies, Far on fearful wings she flies, From the pomp of Sceptered State, From the Rebel's noisy hate. In a cottag'd vale She dwells, Listening to the Sabbath bells! Still around her steps are seen Spotless Honour's meeker mien, Love, the sire of pleasing fears, Sorrow smiling through her tears, And conscious of the past employ Memory, bosom-spring of joy. 1794. ON A DISCOVERY MADE TOO LATE Thou bleedest, my poor Heart! and thy distress Reasoning I ponder with a scornful smile And probe thy sore wound sternly, though the while Swoln be mine eye and dim with heaviness. Why didst thou listen to Hope's whisper bland? Or, listening, why forget the healing tale, When Jealousy with feverous fancies pale Jarr'd thy fine fibres with a maniac's hand? Faint was that Hope, and rayless!—Yet 'twas fair And sooth'd with many a dream the hour of rest: Thou should'st have lov'd it most, when most opprest, And nurs'd it with an agony of care, Even as a mother her sweet infant heir That wan and sickly droops upon her breast! 1794. TO THE AUTHOR OF ‘THE ROBBERS’ Schiller! that hour I would have wish'd to die, If thro' the shuddering midnight I had sent From the dark dungeon of the Tower time-rent That fearful voice, a famish'd Father's cry— Lest in some after moment aught more mean Might stamp me mortal! A triumphant shout Black Horror scream'd, and all her goblin rout Diminish'd shrunk from the more withering scene! Ah! Bard tremendous in sublimity! Could I behold thee in thy loftier mood Wandering at eve with finely-frenzied eye Beneath some vast old tempest-swinging wood! Awhile with mute awe gazing I would brood: Then weep aloud in a wild ecstasy! ?1794. MELANCHOLY A FRAGMENT Stretch'd on a moulder'd Abbey's broadest wall, Where ruining ivies propp'd the ruins steep— Her folded arms wrapping her tatter'd pall, Had Melancholy mus'd herself to sleep. The fern was press'd beneath her hair, The dark green Adder's Tongue was there; And still as pass'd the flagging sea-gale weak, The long lank leaf bow'd fluttering o'er her cheek. That pallid cheek was flush'd: her eager look Beam'd eloquent in slumber! Inly wrought, Imperfect sounds her moving lips forsook, And her bent forehead work'd with troubled thought. Strange was the dream— ?1794. TO A YOUNG ASS ITS MOTHER BEING TETHERED NEAR IT Poor little Foal of an oppresséd race! I love the languid patience of thy face: And oft with gentle hand I give thee bread, And clap thy ragged coat, and pat thy head. But what thy dulled spirits hath dismay'd, That never thou dost sport along the glade? And (most unlike the nature of things young) That earthward still thy moveless head is hung? Do thy prophetic fears anticipate, Meek Child of Misery! thy future fate? The starving meal, and all the thousand aches ‘Which patient Merit of the Unworthy takes’? Or is thy sad heart thrill'd with filial pain To see thy wretched mother's shorten'd chain? And truly, very piteous is her lot— Chain'd to a log within a narrow spot, Where the close-eaten grass is scarcely seen, While sweet around her waves the tempting green! Poor Ass! thy master should have learnt to show Pity—best taught by fellowship of Woe! For much I fear me that He lives like thee, Half famish'd in a land of Luxury! How askingly its footsteps hither bend? It seems to say, ‘And have I then one friend?’ Innocent foal! thou poor despis'd forlorn! I hail thee Brother—spite of the fool's scorn! And fain would take thee with me, in the Dell Of Peace and mild Equality to dwell, Where Toil shall call the charmer Health his bride, And Laughter tickle Plenty's ribless side! How thou wouldst toss thy heels in gamesome play, And frisk about, as lamb or kitten gay! Yea! and more musically sweet to me Thy dissonant harsh bray of joy would be, Than warbled melodies that soothe to rest The aching of pale Fashion's vacant breast! 1794. LINES ON A FRIEND WHO DIED OF A FRENZY FEVER INDUCED BY CALUMNIOUS REPORTS Edmund! thy grave with aching eye I scan, And inly groan for Heaven's poor outcast—Man! 'Tis tempest all or gloom: in early youth If gifted with th' Ithuriel lance of Truth We force to start amid her feign'd caress Vice, siren-hag! in native ugliness; A Brother's fate will haply rouse the tear, And on we go in heaviness and fear! But if our fond hearts call to Pleasure's bower Some pigmy Folly in a careless hour, The faithless guest shall stamp the enchanted ground, And mingled forms of Misery rise around: Heart-fretting Fear, with pallid look aghast, That courts the future woe to hide the past; Remorse, the poison'd arrow in his side, And loud lewd Mirth, to Anguish close allied: Till Frenzy, fierce-eyed child of moping Pain, Darts her hot lightning-flash athwart the brain. Rest, injur'd shade! Shall Slander squatting near Spit her cold venom in a dead man's ear? 'Twas thine to feel the sympathetic glow In Merit's joy, and Poverty's meek woe; Thine all, that cheer the moment as it flies, The zoneless Cares, and smiling Courtesies. Nurs'd in thy heart the firmer Virtues grew, And in thy heart they wither'd! Such chill dew Wan Indolence on each young blossom shed; And Vanity her filmy net-work spread, With eye that roll'd around in asking gaze, And tongue that traffick'd in the trade of praise. Thy follies such! the hard world mark'd them well! Were they more wise, the Proud who never fell? Rest, injur'd shade! the poor man's grateful prayer On heaven-ward wing thy wounded soul shall bear. As oft at twilight gloom thy grave I pass, And sit me down upon its recent grass, With introverted eye I contemplate Similitude of soul, perhaps of—Fate! To me hath Heaven with bounteous hand assign'd Energic Reason and a shaping mind, The daring ken of Truth, the Patriot's part, And Pity's sigh, that breathes the gentle heart— Sloth-jaundic'd all! and from my graspless hand Drop Friendship's precious pearls, like hour-glass sand. I weep, yet stoop not! the faint anguish flows, A dreamy pang in Morning's feverous doze. Is this piled earth our Being's passless mound? Tell me, cold grave! is Death with poppies crown'd? Tired Sentinel! mid fitful starts I nod, And fain would sleep, though pillowed on a clod! 1794. TO A FRIEND [Charles Lamb] TOGETHER WITH AN UNFINISHED POEM Thus far my scanty brain hath built the rhyme Elaborate and swelling: yet the heart Not owns it. From thy spirit-breathing powers I ask not now, my friend! the aiding verse, Tedious to thee, and from thy anxious thought Of dissonant mood. In fancy (well I know) From business wandering far and local cares, Thou creepest round a dear-lov'd Sister's bed With noiseless step, and watchest the faint look, Soothing each pang with fond solicitude, And tenderest tones medicinal of love. I too a Sister had, an only Sister— She lov'd me dearly, and I doted on her! To her I pour'd forth all my puny sorrows (As a sick Patient in a Nurse's arms) And of the heart those hidden maladies That e'en from Friendship's eye will shrink asham'd. O! I have wak'd at midnight, and have wept, Because she was not!—Cheerily, dear Charles! Thou thy best friend shalt cherish many a year: Such warm presages feel I of high Hope. For not uninterested the dear Maid I've view'd—her soul affectionate yet wise, Her polish'd wit as mild as lambent glories That play around a sainted infant's head. He knows (the Spirit that in secret sees, Of whose omniscient and all-spreading Love Aught to implore were impotence of mind) That my mute thoughts are sad before his throne, Prepar'd, when he his healing ray vouchsafes, Thanksgiving to pour forth with lifted heart, And praise Him Gracious with a Brother's Joy! 1794. SONNETS ON EMINENT CHARACTERS CONTRIBUTED TO THE ‘MORNING CHRONICLE’ IN DECEMBER 1794 AND JANUARY 1795 [The Sonnets were introduced by the following letter:— ‘Mr. Editor—If, Sir, the following Poems will not disgrace your poetical department, I will transmit you a series of Sonnets (as it is the fashion to call them) addressed like these to eminent Contemporaries. ‘Jesus College, Cambridge.’ S. T. C.] I TO THE HONOURABLE MR. ERSKINE When British Freedom for an happier land Spread her broad wings, that flutter'd with affright, Erskine! thy voice she heard, and paus'd her flight Sublime of hope, for dreadless thou didst stand (Thy censer glowing with the hallow'd flame) A hireless Priest before the insulted shrine, And at her altar pour the stream divine Of unmatch'd eloquence. Therefore thy name Her sons shall venerate, and cheer thy breast With blessings heaven-ward breath'd. And when the doom Of Nature bids thee die, beyond the tomb Thy light shall shine: as sunk beneath the West Though the great Summer Sun eludes our gaze, Still burns wide Heaven with his distended blaze. ‘Our elegant correspondent will highly gratify every reader of taste by the continuance of his exquisitely beautiful productions. No. II. shall appear on an early day.’ December 1, 1794. II BURKE As late I lay in Slumber's shadowy vale, With wetted cheek and in a mourner's guise, I saw the sainted form of Freedom rise: She spake! not sadder moans the autumnal gale— ‘Great Son of Genius! sweet to me thy name, Ere in an evil hour with alter'd voice Thou bad'st Oppression's hireling crew rejoice Blasting with wizard spell my laurell'd fame. ‘Yet never, Burke! thou drank'st Corruption's bowl! Thee stormy Pity and the cherish'd lure Of Pomp, and proud Precipitance of soul Wilder'd with meteor fires. Ah Spirit pure! ‘That Error's mist had left thy purgéd eye: So might I clasp thee with a Mother's joy!’ December 9, 1794. III PRIESTLEY Though rous'd by that dark Vizir Riot rude Have driven our Priestley o'er the Ocean swell; Though Superstition and her wolfish brood Bay his mild radiance, impotent and fell; Calm in his halls of brightness he shall dwell! For lo! Religion at his strong behest Starts with mild anger from the Papal spell, And flings to Earth her tinsel-glittering vest, Her mitred State and cumbrous Pomp unholy; And Justice wakes to bid th' Oppressor wail Insulting aye the wrongs of patient Folly; And from her dark retreat by Wisdom won Meek Nature slowly lifts her matron veil To smile with fondness on her gazing Son! December 11, 1794. IV LA FAYETTE As when far off the warbled strains are heard That soar on Morning's wing the vales among; Within his cage the imprison'd Matin Bird Swells the full chorus with a generous song: He bathes no pinion in the dewy light, No Father's joy, no Lover's bliss he shares, Yet still the rising radiance cheers his sight— His fellows' Freedom soothes the Captive's cares! Thou, Fayette! who didst wake with startling voice Life's better Sun from that long wintry night, Thus in thy Country's triumphs shalt rejoice And mock with raptures high the Dungeon's might: For lo! the Morning struggles into Day, And Slavery's spectres shriek and vanish from the ray! The above beautiful sonnet was written antecedently to the joyful account of the Patriot's escape from the Tyrant's Dungeon. [Note in M. C.] December 15, 1794. V KOSKIUSKO O what a loud and fearful shriek was there, As though a thousand souls one death-groan pour'd! Ah me! they saw beneath a Hireling's sword Their Koskiusko fall! Through the swart air (As pauses the tir'd Cossac's barbarous yell Of Triumph) on the chill and midnight gale Rises with frantic burst or sadder swell The dirge of murder'd Hope! while Freedom pale Bends in such anguish o'er her destin'd bier, As if from eldest time some Spirit meek Had gather'd in a mystic urn each tear That ever on a Patriot's furrow'd cheek Fit channel found; and she had drain'd the bowl In the mere wilfulness, and sick despair of soul! December 16, 1794. VI PITT Not always should the Tear's ambrosial dew Roll its soft anguish down thy furrow'd cheek! Not always heaven-breath'd tones of Suppliance meek Beseem thee, Mercy! Yon dark Scowler view, Who with proud words of dear-lov'd Freedom came— More blasting than the mildew from the South! And kiss'd his country with Iscariot mouth (Ah! foul apostate from his Father's fame!) Then fix'd her on the Cross of deep distress, And at safe distance marks the thirsty Lance Pierce her big side! But O! if some strange trance The eye-lids of thy stern-brow'd Sister press, Seize, Mercy! thou more terrible the brand, And hurl her thunderbolts with fiercer hand! December 23, 1794. VII TO THE REV. W. L. BOWLES [FIRST VERSION, PRINTED IN ‘MORNING CHRONICLE’, DECEMBER 26, 1794] My heart has thank'd thee, Bowles! for those soft strains, That, on the still air floating, tremblingly Wak'd in me Fancy, Love, and Sympathy! For hence, not callous to a Brother's pains Thro' Youth's gay prime and thornless paths I went; And, when the darker day of life began, And I did roam, a thought-bewilder'd man! Thy kindred Lays an healing solace lent, Each lonely pang with dreamy joys combin'd, And stole from vain Regret her scorpion stings; While shadowy Pleasure, with mysterious wings, Brooded the wavy and tumultuous mind, Like that great Spirit, who with plastic sweep Mov'd on the darkness of the formless Deep! VII TO THE REV. W. L. BOWLES [SECOND VERSION] My heart has thank'd thee, Bowles! for those soft strains Whose sadness soothes me, like the murmuring Of wild-bees in the sunny showers of spring! For hence not callous to the mourner's pains Through Youth's gay prime and thornless paths I went: And when the mightier Throes of mind began, And drove me forth, a thought-bewilder'd man, Their mild and manliest melancholy lent A mingled charm, such as the pang consign'd To slumber, though the big tear it renew'd; Bidding a strange mysterious Pleasure brood Over the wavy and tumultuous mind, As the great Spirit erst with plastic sweep Mov'd on the darkness of the unform'd deep. VIII MRS. SIDDONS As when a child on some long Winter's night Affrighted clinging to its Grandam's knees With eager wond'ring and perturb'd delight Listens strange tales of fearful dark decrees Mutter'd to wretch by necromantic spell; Or of those hags, who at the witching time Of murky Midnight ride the air sublime, And mingle foul embrace with fiends of Hell: Cold Horror drinks its blood! Anon the tear More gentle starts, to hear the Beldame tell Of pretty Babes, that lov'd each other dear. Murder'd by cruel Uncle's mandate fell: Even such the shiv'ring joys thy tones impart, Even so thou, Siddons! meltest my sad heart! December 29, 1794. IX TO WILLIAM GODWIN AUTHOR OF ‘POLITICAL JUSTICE’ O form'd t' illume a sunless world forlorn, As o'er the chill and dusky brow of Night, In Finland's wintry skies the Mimic Morn Electric pours a stream of rosy light, Pleas'd I have mark'd Oppression, terror-pale, Since, thro' the windings of her dark machine, Thy steady eye has shot its glances keen— And bade th' All-lovely ‘scenes at distance hail’. Nor will I not thy holy guidance bless, And hymn thee, Godwin! with an ardent lay; For that thy voice, in Passion's stormy day, When wild I roam'd the bleak Heath of Distress, Bade the bright form of Justice meet my way— And told me that her name was Happiness. January 10, 1795. X TO ROBERT SOUTHEY OF BALIOL COLLEGE, OXFORD, AUTHOR OF THE ‘RETROSPECT’, AND OTHER POEMS Southey! thy melodies steal o'er mine ear Like far-off joyance, or the murmuring Of wild bees in the sunny showers of Spring— Sounds of such mingled import as may cheer The lonely breast, yet rouse a mindful tear: Wak'd by the Song doth Hope-born Fancy fling Rich showers of dewy fragrance from her wing, Till sickly Passion's drooping Myrtles sear Blossom anew! But O! more thrill'd, I prize Thy sadder strains, that bid in Memory's Dream The faded forms of past Delight arise; Then soft, on Love's pale cheek, the tearful gleam Of Pleasure smiles—as faint yet beauteous lies The imag'd Rainbow on a willowy stream. January 14, 1795. XI TO RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN, ESQ. It was some Spirit, Sheridan! that breath'd O'er thy young mind such wildly-various power! My soul hath mark'd thee in her shaping hour, Thy temples with Hymettian flow'rets wreath'd: And sweet thy voice, as when o'er Laura's bier Sad Music trembled thro' Vauclusa's glade; Sweet, as at dawn the love-lorn Serenade That wafts soft dreams to Slumber's listening ear. Now patriot Rage and Indignation high Swell the full tones! And now thine eye-beams dance Meanings of Scorn and Wit's quaint revelry! Writhes inly from the bosom-probing glance The Apostate by the brainless rout ador'd, As erst that elder Fiend beneath great Michael's sword. January 29, 1795. [XII] TO LORD STANHOPE ON READING HIS LATE PROTEST IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS [‘MORNING CHRONICLE,’ JAN. 31, 1795] Stanhope! I hail, with ardent Hymn, thy name! Thou shalt be bless'd and lov'd, when in the dust Thy corse shall moulder—Patriot pure and just! And o'er thy tomb the grateful hand of Fame Shall grave:—‘Here sleeps the Friend of Humankind!’ For thou, untainted by Corruption's bowl, Or foul Ambition, with undaunted soul Hast spoke the language of a Free-born mind Pleading the cause of Nature! Still pursue Thy path of Honour!—To thy Country true, Still watch th' expiring flame of Liberty! O Patriot! still pursue thy virtuous way, As holds his course the splendid Orb of Day, Or thro' the stormy or the tranquil sky! One of the People. 1795. TO EARL STANHOPE Not, Stanhope! with the Patriot's doubtful name I mock thy worth—Friend of the Human Race! Since scorning Faction's low and partial aim Aloof thou wendest in thy stately pace, Thyself redeeming from that leprous stain, Nobility: and aye unterrify'd Pourest thine Abdiel warnings on the train That sit complotting with rebellious pride 'Gainst Her who from the Almighty's bosom leapt With whirlwind arm, fierce Minister of Love! Wherefore, ere Virtue o'er thy tomb hath wept, Angels shall lead thee to the Throne above: And thou from forth its clouds shalt hear the voice, Champion of Freedom and her God! rejoice! 1795. LINES TO A FRIEND IN ANSWER TO A MELANCHOLY LETTER Away, those cloudy looks, that labouring sigh, The peevish offspring of a sickly hour! Nor meanly thus complain of Fortune's power, When the blind Gamester throws a luckless die. Yon setting Sun flashes a mournful gleam Behind those broken clouds, his stormy train: To-morrow shall the many-colour'd main In brightness roll beneath his orient beam! Wild, as the autumnal gust, the hand of Time Flies o'er his mystic lyre: in shadowy dance The alternate groups of Joy and Grief advance Responsive to his varying strains sublime! Bears on its wing each hour a load of Fate; The swain, who, lull'd by Seine's mild murmurs, led His weary oxen to their nightly shed, To-day may rule a tempest-troubled State. Nor shall not Fortune with a vengeful smile Survey the sanguinary Despot's might, And haply hurl the Pageant from his height Unwept to wander in some savage isle. There shiv'ring sad beneath the tempest's frown Round his tir'd limbs to wrap the purple vest; And mix'd with nails and beads, an equal jest! Barter for food, the jewels of his crown. ?1795. TO AN INFANT Ah! cease thy tears and sobs, my little Life! I did but snatch away the unclasp'd knife: Some safer toy will soon arrest thine eye, And to quick laughter change this peevish cry! Poor stumbler on the rocky coast of Woe, Tutor'd by Pain each source of pain to know! Alike the foodful fruit and scorching fire Awake thy eager grasp and young desire; Alike the Good, the Ill offend thy sight, And rouse the stormy sense of shrill Affright! Untaught, yet wise! mid all thy brief alarms Thou closely clingest to thy Mother's arms, Nestling thy little face in that fond breast Whose anxious heavings lull thee to thy rest! Man's breathing Miniature! thou mak'st me sigh— A Babe art thou—and such a Thing am I! To anger rapid and as soon appeas'd, For trifles mourning and by trifles pleas'd, Break Friendship's mirror with a tetchy blow, Yet snatch what coals of fire on Pleasure's altar glow! O thou that rearest with celestial aim The future Seraph in my mortal frame, Thrice holy Faith! whatever thorns I meet As on I totter with unpractis'd feet, Still let me stretch my arms and cling to thee, Meek nurse of souls through their long Infancy! 1795. TO THE REV. W. J. HORT WHILE TEACHING A YOUNG LADY SOME SONG-TUNES ON HIS FLUTE I Hush! ye clamorous Cares! be mute! Again, dear Harmonist! again Thro' the hollow of thy flute Breathe that passion-warbled strain: Till Memory each form shall bring The loveliest of her shadowy throng; And Hope, that soars on sky-lark wing, Carol wild her gladdest song! II O skill'd with magic spell to roll The thrilling tones, that concentrate the soul! Breathe thro' thy flute those tender notes again, While near thee sits the chaste-eyed Maiden mild; And bid her raise the Poet's kindred strain In soft impassion'd voice, correctly wild. III In Freedom's undivided dell, Where Toil and Health with mellow'd Love shall dwell, Far from folly, far from men, In the rude romantic glen, Up the cliff, and thro' the glade, Wandering with the dear-lov'd maid, I shall listen to the lay, And ponder on thee far away Still, as she bids those thrilling notes aspire (‘Making my fond attunéd heart her lyre’), Thy honour'd form, my Friend! shall reappear, And I will thank thee with a raptur'd tear. 1795. PITY Sweet Mercy! how my very heart has bled To see thee, poor Old Man! and thy grey hairs Hoar with the snowy blast: while no one cares To clothe thy shrivell'd limbs and palsied head. My Father! throw away this tatter'd vest That mocks thy shivering! take my garment—use A young man's arm! I'll melt these frozen dews That hang from thy white beard and numb thy breast. My Sara too shall tend thee, like a child: And thou shalt talk, in our fireside's recess, Of purple Pride, that scowls on Wretchedness— He did not so, the Galilaean mild, Who met the Lazars turn'd from rich men's doors And call'd them Friends, and heal'd their noisome sores! ?1795. TO THE NIGHTINGALE Sister of love-lorn Poets, Philomel! How many Bards in city garret pent, While at their window they with downward eye Mark the faint lamp-beam on the kennell'd mud, And listen to the drowsy cry of Watchmen (Those hoarse unfeather'd Nightingales of Time!), How many wretched Bards address thy name, And hers, the full-orb'd Queen that shines above. But I do hear thee, and the high bough mark, Within whose mild moon-mellow'd foliage hid Thou warblest sad thy pity-pleading strains. O! I have listen'd, till my working soul, Waked by those strains to thousand phantasies, Absorb'd hath ceas'd to listen! Therefore oft, I hymn thy name: and with a proud delight Oft will I tell thee, Minstrel of the Moon! ‘Most musical, most melancholy’ Bird! That all thy soft diversities of tone, Tho' sweeter far than the delicious airs That vibrate from a white-arm'd Lady's harp, What time the languishment of lonely love Melts in her eye, and heaves her breast of snow, Are not so sweet as is the voice of her, My Sara—best beloved of human kind! When breathing the pure soul of tenderness, She thrills me with the Husband's promis'd name! 1795. LINES COMPOSED WHILE CLIMBING THE LEFT ASCENT OF BROCKLEY COOMB, SOMERSETSHIRE, MAY 1795 With many a pause and oft reverted eye I climb the Coomb's ascent: sweet songsters near Warble in shade their wild-wood melody: Far off the unvarying Cuckoo soothes my ear. Up scour the startling stragglers of the flock That on green plots o'er precipices browze: From the deep fissures of the naked rock The Yew-tree bursts! Beneath its dark green boughs (Mid which the May-thorn blends its blossoms white) Where broad smooth stones jut out in mossy seats, I rest:—and now have gain'd the topmost site. Ah! what a luxury of landscape meets My gaze! Proud towers, and Cots more dear to me, Elm-shadow'd Fields, and prospect-bounding Sea! Deep sighs my lonely heart: I drop the tear: Enchanting spot! O were my Sara here! LINES IN THE MANNER OF SPENSER O Peace, that on a lilied bank dost love To rest thine head beneath an Olive-Tree, I would that from the pinions of thy Dove One quill withouten pain ypluck'd might be! For O! I wish my Sara's frowns to flee, And fain to her some soothing song would write, Lest she resent my rude discourtesy, Who vow'd to meet her ere the morning light, But broke my plighted word—ah! false and recreant wight! Last night as I my weary head did pillow With thoughts of my dissever'd Fair engross'd, Chill Fancy droop'd wreathing herself with willow, As though my breast entomb'd a pining ghost. ‘From some blest couch, young Rapture's bridal boast, Rejected Slumber! hither wing thy way; But leave me with the matin hour, at most! As night-clos'd floweret to the orient ray, My sad heart will expand, when I the Maid survey.’ But Love, who heard the silence of my thought, Contriv'd a too successful wile, I ween: And whisper'd to himself, with malice fraught— ‘Too long our Slave the Damsel's smiles hath seen: To-morrow shall he ken her alter'd mien!’ He spake, and ambush'd lay, till on my bed The morning shot her dewy glances keen, When as I 'gan to lift my drowsy head— ‘Now, Bard! I'll work thee woe!’ the laughing Elfin said. Sleep, softly-breathing God! his downy wing Was fluttering now, as quickly to depart; When twang'd an arrow from Love's mystic string, With pathless wound it pierc'd him to the heart. Was there some magic in the Elfin's dart? Or did he strike my couch with wizard lance? For straight so fair a Form did upwards start (No fairer deck'd the bowers of old Romance) That Sleep enamour'd grew, nor mov'd from his sweet trance! My Sara came, with gentlest look divine; Bright shone her eye, yet tender was its beam: I felt the pressure of her lip to mine! Whispering we went, and Love was all our theme— Love pure and spotless, as at first, I deem, He sprang from Heaven! Such joys with Sleep did 'bide, That I the living Image of my Dream Fondly forgot. Too late I woke, and sigh'd— ‘O! how shall I behold my Love at eventide!’ 1795. THE HOUR WHEN WE SHALL MEET AGAIN (Composed during Illness, and in Absence.) Dim Hour! that sleep'st on pillowing clouds afar, O rise and yoke the Turtles to thy car! Bend o'er the traces, blame each lingering Dove, And give me to the bosom of my Love! My gentle Love, caressing and carest, With heaving heart shall cradle me to rest! Shed the warm tear-drop from her smiling eyes, Lull with fond woe, and medicine me with sighs! While finely-flushing float her kisses meek, Like melted rubies, o'er my pallid cheek. Chill'd by the night, the drooping Rose of May Mourns the long absence of the lovely Day; Young Day returning at her promis'd hour Weeps o'er the sorrows of her favourite Flower; Weeps the soft dew, the balmy gale she sighs, And darts a trembling lustre from her eyes. New life and joy th' expanding flow'ret feels: His pitying Mistress mourns, and mourning heals! ?1795. LINES WRITTEN AT SHURTON BARS, NEAR BRIDGEWATER, SEPTEMBER 1795, IN ANSWER TO A LETTER FROM BRISTOL Good verse most good, and bad verse then seems better Receiv'd from absent friend by way of Letter. For what so sweet can labour'd lays impart As one rude rhyme warm from a friendly heart? —Anon. Nor travels my meandering eye The starry wilderness on high; Nor now with curious sight I mark the glow-worm, as I pass, Move with ‘green radiance’ through the grass, An emerald of light. O ever present to my view! My wafted spirit is with you, And soothes your boding fears: I see you all oppressed with gloom Sit lonely in that cheerless room— Ah me! You are in tears! Belovéd Woman! did you fly Chill'd Friendship's dark disliking eye, Or Mirth's untimely din? With cruel weight these trifles press A temper sore with tenderness, When aches the void within. But why with sable wand unblessed Should Fancy rouse within my breast Dim-visag'd shapes of Dread? Untenanting its beauteous clay My Sara's soul has wing'd its way, And hovers round my head! I felt it prompt the tender Dream, When slowly sank the day's last gleam; You rous'd each gentler sense, As sighing o'er the Blossom's bloom Meek Evening wakes its soft perfume With viewless influence. And hark, my Love! The sea-breeze moans Through yon reft house! O'er rolling stones In bold ambitious sweep The onward-surging tides supply The silence of the cloudless sky With mimic thunders deep. Dark reddening from the channell'd Isle (Where stands one solitary pile Unslated by the blast) The Watchfire, like a sullen star Twinkles to many a dozing Tar Rude cradled on the mast. Even there—beneath that light-house tower— In the tumultuous evil hour Ere Peace with Sara came, Time was, I should have thought it sweet To count the echoings of my feet, And watch the storm-vex'd flame. And there in black soul-jaundic'd fit A sad gloom-pamper'd Man to sit, And listen to the roar: When mountain surges bellowing deep With an uncouth monster-leap Plung'd foaming on the shore. Then by the lightning's blaze to mark Some toiling tempest-shatter'd bark; Her vain distress-guns hear; And when a second sheet of light Flash'd o'er the blackness of the night— To see no vessel there! But Fancy now more gaily sings; Or if awhile she droop her wings, As skylarks 'mid the corn, On summer fields she grounds her breast: The oblivious poppy o'er her nest Nods, till returning morn. O mark those smiling tears, that swell The open'd rose! From heaven they fell, And with the sun-beam blend. Blest visitations from above, Such are the tender woes of Love Fostering the heart they bend! When stormy Midnight howling round Beats on our roof with clattering sound, To me your arms you'll stretch: Great God! you'll say—To us so kind, O shelter from this loud bleak wind The houseless, friendless wretch! The tears that tremble down your cheek, Shall bathe my kisses chaste and meek In Pity's dew divine; And from your heart the sighs that steal Shall make your rising bosom feel The answering swell of mine! How oft, my Love! with shapings sweet I paint the moment, we shall meet! With eager speed I dart— I seize you in the vacant air, And fancy, with a husband's care I press you to my heart! 'Tis said, in Summer's evening hour Flashes the golden-colour'd flower A fair electric flame: And so shall flash my love-charg'd eye When all the heart's big ecstasy Shoots rapid through the frame! 1795. THE EOLIAN HARP COMPOSED AT CLEVEDON, SOMERSETSHIRE My pensive Sara! thy soft cheek reclined Thus on mine arm, most soothing sweet it is To sit beside our Cot, our Cot o'ergrown With white-flower'd Jasmin, and the broad-leav'd Myrtle, (Meet emblems they of Innocence and Love!) And watch the clouds, that late were rich with light, Slow saddening round, and mark the star of eve Serenely brilliant (such should Wisdom be) Shine opposite! How exquisite the scents Snatch'd from yon bean-field! and the world so hush'd! The stilly murmur of the distant Sea Tells us of silence. And that simplest Lute, Placed length-ways in the clasping casement, hark! How by the desultory breeze caress'd, Like some coy maid half yielding to her lover, It pours such sweet upbraiding, as must needs Tempt to repeat the wrong! And now, its strings Boldlier swept, the long sequacious notes Over delicious surges sink and rise, Such a soft floating witchery of sound As twilight Elfins make, when they at eve Voyage on gentle gales from Fairy-Land, Where Melodies round honey-dropping flowers, Footless and wild, like birds of Paradise, Nor pause, nor perch, hovering on untam'd wing! O! the one Life within us and abroad, Which meets all motion and becomes its soul, A light in sound, a sound-like power in light, Rhythm in all thought, and joyance every where— Methinks, it should have been impossible Not to love all things in a world so fill'd; Where the breeze warbles, and the mute still air Is Music slumbering on her instrument. And thus, my Love! as on the midway slope Of yonder hill I stretch my limbs at noon, Whilst through my half-clos'd eye-lids I behold The sunbeams dance, like diamonds, on the main, And tranquil muse upon tranquillity; Full many a thought uncall'd and undetain'd, And many idle flitting phantasies, Traverse my indolent and passive brain, As wild and various as the random gales That swell and flutter on this subject Lute! And what if all of animated nature Be but organic Harps diversely fram'd, That tremble into thought, as o'er them sweeps Plastic and vast, one intellectual breeze, At once the Soul of each, and God of all? But thy more serious eye a mild reproof Darts, O belovéd Woman! nor such thoughts Dim and unhallow'd dost thou not reject, And biddest me walk humbly with my God. Meek Daughter in the family of Christ! Well hast thou said and holily disprais'd These shapings of the unregenerate mind; Bubbles that glitter as they rise and break On vain Philosophy's aye-babbling spring. For never guiltless may I speak of him, The Incomprehensible! save when with awe I praise him, and with Faith that inly feels; Who with his saving mercies healéd me, A sinful and most miserable man, Wilder'd and dark, and gave me to possess Peace, and this Cot, and thee, heart-honour'd Maid! 1795. TO THE AUTHOR OF POEMS [Joseph Cottle] PUBLISHED ANONYMOUSLY AT BRISTOL IN SEPTEMBER 1795 Unboastful Bard! whose verse concise yet clear Tunes to smooth melody unconquer'd sense, May your fame fadeless live, as ‘never-sere’ The Ivy wreathes yon Oak, whose broad defence Embowers me from Noon's sultry influence! For, like that nameless Rivulet stealing by, Your modest verse to musing Quiet dear Is rich with tints heaven-borrow'd: the charm'd eye Shall gaze undazzled there, and love the soften'd sky. Circling the base of the Poetic mount A stream there is, which rolls in lazy flow Its coal-black waters from Oblivion's fount: The vapour-poison'd Birds, that fly too low, Fall with dead swoop, and to the bottom go. Escaped that heavy stream on pinion fleet Beneath the Mountain's lofty-frowning brow, Ere aught of perilous ascent you meet, A mead of mildest charm delays th' unlabouring feet. Not there the cloud-climb'd rock, sublime and vast, That like some giant king, o'er-glooms the hill; Nor there the Pine-grove to the midnight blast Makes solemn music! But th' unceasing rill To the soft Wren or Lark's descending trill Murmurs sweet undersong 'mid jasmin bowers. In this same pleasant meadow, at your will I ween, you wander'd—there collecting flowers Of sober tint, and herbs of med'cinable powers! There for the monarch-murder'd Soldier's tomb You wove th' unfinish'd wreath of saddest hues; And to that holier chaplet added bloom Besprinkling it with Jordan's cleansing dews. But lo your Henderson awakes the Muse— His Spirit beckon'd from the mountain's height! You left the plain and soar'd mid richer views! So Nature mourn'd when sunk the First Day's light, With stars, unseen before, spangling her robe of night! Still soar, my Friend, those richer views among, Strong, rapid, fervent, flashing Fancy's beam! Virtue and Truth shall love your gentler song; But Poesy demands th' impassion'd theme: Waked by Heaven's silent dews at Eve's mild gleam What balmy sweets Pomona breathes around! But if the vext air rush a stormy stream Or Autumn's shrill gust moan in plaintive sound, With fruits and flowers she loads the tempest-honor'd ground. 1795. THE SILVER THIMBLE THE PRODUCTION OF A YOUNG LADY, ADDRESSED TO THE AUTHOR OF THE POEMS ALLUDED TO IN THE PRECEDING EPISTLE She had lost her Silver Thimble, and her complaint being accidentally overheard by him, her Friend, he immediately sent her four others to take her choice of. As oft mine eye with careless glance Has gallop'd thro' some old romance, Of speaking Birds and Steeds with wings, Giants and Dwarfs, and Fiends and Kings; Beyond the rest with more attentive care I've lov'd to read of elfin-favour'd Fair— How if she long'd for aught beneath the sky And suffer'd to escape one votive sigh, Wafted along on viewless pinions aery It laid itself obsequious at her feet: Such things, I thought, one might not hope to meet Save in the dear delicious land of Faery! But now (by proof I know it well) There's still some peril in free wishing— Politeness is a licensed spell, And you, dear Sir! the Arch-magician. You much perplex'd me by the various set: They were indeed an elegant quartette! My mind went to and fro, and waver'd long; At length I've chosen (Samuel thinks me wrong) That, around whose azure rim Silver figures seem to swim, Like fleece-white clouds, that on the skiey Blue, Waked by no breeze, the self-same shapes retain; Or ocean-Nymphs with limbs of snowy hue Slow-floating o'er the calm cerulean plain. Just such a one, mon cher ami, (The finger shield of industry) Th' inventive Gods, I deem, to Pallas gave What time the vain Arachne, madly brave, Challeng'd the blue-eyed Virgin of the sky A duel in embroider'd work to try. And hence the thimbled Finger of grave Pallas To th' erring Needle's point was more than callous. But ah the poor Arachne! She unarm'd Blundering thro' hasty eagerness, alarm'd With all a Rival's hopes, a Mortal's fears, Still miss'd the stitch, and stain'd the web with tears. Unnumber'd punctures small yet sore Full fretfully the maiden bore, Till she her lily finger found Crimson'd with many a tiny wound; And to her eyes, suffus'd with watery woe, Her flower-embroider'd web danc'd dim, I wist, Like blossom'd shrubs in a quick-moving mist: Till vanquish'd the despairing Maid sunk low. O Bard! whom sure no common Muse inspires, I heard your Verse that glows with vestal fires! And I from unwatch'd needle's erring point Had surely suffer'd on each finger-joint Those wounds, which erst did poor Arachne meet; While he, the much-lov'd Object of my choice (My bosom thrilling with enthusiast heat), Pour'd on mine ear with deep impressive voice, How the great Prophet of the Desart stood And preach'd of Penitence by Jordan's Flood; On War; or else the legendary lays In simplest measures hymn'd to Alla's praise; Or what the Bard from his heart's inmost stores O'er his Friend's grave in loftier numbers pours: Yes, Bard polite! you but obey'd the laws Of Justice, when the thimble you had sent; What wounds your thought-bewildering Muse might cause 'Tis well your finger-shielding gifts prevent. Sara. 1795. REFLECTIONS ON HAVING LEFT A PLACE OF RETIREMENT Sermoni propriora. —Hor. Low was our pretty Cot: our tallest Rose Peep'd at the chamber-window. We could hear At silent noon, and eve, and early morn, The Sea's faint murmur. In the open air Our Myrtles blossom'd; and across the porch Thick Jasmins twined: the little landscape round Was green and woody, and refresh'd the eye. It was a spot which you might aptly call The Valley of Seclusion! Once I saw (Hallowing his Sabbath-day by quietness) A wealthy son of Commerce saunter by, Bristowa's citizen: methought, it calm'd His thirst of idle gold, and made him muse With wiser feelings: for he paus'd, and look'd With a pleas'd sadness, and gaz'd all around, Then eyed our Cottage, and gaz'd round again, And sigh'd, and said, it was a Blesséd Place. And we were bless'd. Oft with patient ear Long-listening to the viewless sky-lark's note (Viewless, or haply for a moment seen Gleaming on sunny wings) in whisper'd tones I've said to my Belovéd, ‘Such, sweet Girl! The inobtrusive song of Happiness, Unearthly minstrelsy! then only heard When the Soul seeks to hear; when all is hush'd, And the Heart listens!’ But the time, when first From that low Dell, steep up the stony Mount I climb'd with perilous toil and reach'd the top, Oh! what a goodly scene! Here the bleak mount, The bare bleak mountain speckled thin with sheep; Grey clouds, that shadowing spot the sunny fields; And river, now with bushy rocks o'er-brow'd, Now winding bright and full, with naked banks; And seats, and lawns, the Abbey and the wood, And cots, and hamlets, and faint city-spire; The Channel there, the Islands and white sails, Dim coasts, and cloud-like hills, and shoreless Ocean— It seem'd like Omnipresence! God, methought, Had built him there a Temple: the whole World Seem'd imag'd in its vast circumference: No wish profan'd my overwhelméd heart. Blest hour! It was a luxury,—to be! Ah! quiet Dell! dear Cot, and Mount sublime! I was constrain'd to quit you. Was it right, While my unnumber'd brethren toil'd and bled, That I should dream away the entrusted hours On rose-leaf beds, pampering the coward heart With feelings all too delicate for use? Sweet is the tear that from some Howard's eye Drops on the cheek of one he lifts from earth: And he that works me good with unmov'd face, Does it but half: he chills me while he aids, My benefactor, not my brother man! Yet even this, this cold beneficence Praise, praise it, O my Soul! oft as thou scann'st The sluggard Pity's vision-weaving tribe! Who sigh for Wretchedness, yet shun the Wretched, Nursing in some delicious solitude Their slothful loves and dainty sympathies! I therefore go, and join head, heart, and hand, Active and firm, to fight the bloodless fight Of Science, Freedom, and the Truth in Christ. Yet oft when after honourable toil Rests the tir'd mind, and waking loves to dream, My spirit shall revisit thee, dear Cot! Thy Jasmin and thy window-peeping Rose, And Myrtles fearless of the mild sea-air. And I shall sigh fond wishes—sweet Abode! Ah!—had none greater! And that all had such! It might be so—but the time is not yet. Speed it, O Father! Let thy Kingdom come! 1795. RELIGIOUS MUSINGS A DESULTORY POEM, WRITTEN ON THE CHRISTMAS EVE OF 1794 This is the time, when most divine to hear, The voice of Adoration rouses me, As with a Cherub's trump: and high upborne, Yea, mingling with the Choir, I seem to view The vision of the heavenly multitude, Who hymned the song of Peace o'er Bethlehem's fields! Yet thou more bright than all the Angel-blaze, That harbingered thy birth, Thou Man of Woes! Despiséd Galilaean! For the Great Invisible (by symbols only seen) With a peculiar and surpassing light Shines from the visage of the oppressed good man, When heedless of himself the scourgéd saint Mourns for the oppressor. Fair the vernal mead, Fair the high grove, the sea, the sun, the stars; True impress each of their creating Sire! Yet nor high grove, nor many-colour'd mead, Nor the green ocean with his thousand isles, Nor the starred azure, nor the sovran sun, E'er with such majesty of portraiture Imaged the supreme beauty uncreate, As thou, meek Saviour! at the fearful hour When thy insulted anguish winged the prayer Harped by Archangels, when they sing of mercy! Which when the Almighty heard from forth his throne Diviner light filled Heaven with ecstasy! Heaven's hymnings paused: and Hell her yawning mouth Closed a brief moment. Lovely was the death Of Him whose life was Love! Holy with power He on the thought-benighted Sceptic beamed Manifest Godhead, melting into day What floating mists of dark idolatry Broke and misshaped the omnipresent Sire: And first by Fear uncharmed the drowséd Soul. Till of its nobler nature it 'gan feel Dim recollections; and thence soared to Hope, Strong to believe whate'er of mystic good The Eternal dooms for His immortal sons. From Hope and firmer Faith to perfect Love Attracted and absorbed: and centered there God only to behold, and know, and feel, Till by exclusive consciousness of God All self-annihilated it shall make God its Identity: God all in all! We and our Father one! And blest are they, Who in this fleshly World, the elect of Heaven, Their strong eye darting through the deeds of men, Adore with steadfast unpresuming gaze Him Nature's essence, mind, and energy! And gazing, trembling, patiently ascend Treading beneath their feet all visible things As steps, that upward to their Father's throne Lead gradual—else nor glorified nor loved. They nor contempt embosom nor revenge: For they dare know of what may seem deform The Supreme Fair sole operant: in whose sight All things are pure, his strong controlling love Alike from all educing perfect good. Their's too celestial courage, inly armed— Dwarfing Earth's giant brood, what time they muse On their great Father, great beyond compare! And marching onwards view high o'er their heads His waving banners of Omnipotence. Who the Creator love, created Might Dread not: within their tents no Terrors walk. For they are holy things before the Lord Aye unprofaned, though Earth should league with Hell; God's altar grasping with an eager hand Fear, the wild-visag'd, pale, eye-starting wretch, Sure-refug'd hears his hot pursuing fiends Yell at vain distance. Soon refresh'd from Heaven He calms the throb and tempest of his heart. His countenance settles; a soft solemn bliss Swims in his eye—his swimming eye uprais'd: And Faith's whole armour glitters on his limbs! And thus transfigured with a dreadless awe, A solemn hush of soul, meek he beholds All things of terrible seeming: yea, unmoved Views e'en the immitigable ministers That shower down vengeance on these latter days. For kindling with intenser Deity From the celestial Mercy-seat they come, And at the renovating wells of Love Have fill'd their vials with salutary wrath, To sickly Nature more medicinal Than what soft balm the weeping good man pours Into the lone despoiléd traveller's wounds! Thus from the Elect, regenerate through faith, Pass the dark Passions and what thirsty cares Drink up the spirit, and the dim regards Self-centre. Lo they vanish! or acquire New names, new features—by supernal grace Enrobed with Light, and naturalised in Heaven. As when a shepherd on a vernal morn Through some thick fog creeps timorous with slow foot, Darkling he fixes on the immediate road His downward eye: all else of fairest kind Hid or deformed. But lo! the bursting Sun! Touched by the enchantment of that sudden beam Straight the black vapour melteth, and in globes Of dewy glitter gems each plant and tree; On every leaf, on every blade it hangs! Dance glad the new-born intermingling rays, And wide around the landscape streams with glory! There is one Mind, one omnipresent Mind, Omnific. His most holy name is Love. Truth of subliming import! with the which Who feeds and saturates his constant soul, He from his small particular orbit flies With blest outstarting! From himself he flies, Stands in the sun, and with no partial gaze Views all creation; and he loves it all, And blesses it, and calls it very good! This is indeed to dwell with the Most High! Cherubs and rapture-trembling Seraphim Can press no nearer to the Almighty's throne. But that we roam unconscious, or with hearts Unfeeling of our universal Sire, And that in His vast family no Cain Injures uninjured (in her best-aimed blow Victorious Murder a blind Suicide) Haply for this some younger Angel now Looks down on Human Nature: and, behold! A sea of blood bestrewed with wrecks, where mad Embattling Interests on each other rush With unhelmed rage! 'Tis the sublime of man, Our noontide Majesty, to know ourselves Parts and proportions of one wondrous whole! This fraternises man, this constitutes Our charities and bearings. But 'tis God Diffused through all, that doth make all one whole; This the worst superstition, him except Aught to desire, Supreme Reality! The plenitude and permanence of bliss! O Fiends of Superstition! not that oft The erring Priest hath stained with brother's blood Your grisly idols, not for this may wrath Thunder against you from the Holy One! But o'er some plain that steameth to the sun, Peopled with Death; or where more hideous Trade Loud-laughing packs his bales of human anguish; I will raise up a mourning, O ye Fiends! And curse your spells, that film the eye of Faith, Hiding the present God; whose presence lost, The moral world's cohesion, we become An Anarchy of Spirits! Toy-bewitched, Made blind by lusts, disherited of soul, No common centre Man, no common sire Knoweth! A sordid solitary thing, Mid countless brethren with a lonely heart Through courts and cities the smooth savage roams Feeling himself, his own low self the whole; When he by sacred sympathy might make The whole one Self! Self, that no alien knows! Self, far diffused as Fancy's wing can travel! Self, spreading still! Oblivious of its own, Yet all of all possessing! This is Faith! This the Messiah's destined victory! But first offences needs must come! Even now (Black Hell laughs horrible—to hear the scoff!) Thee to defend, meek Galilaean! Thee And thy mild laws of Love unutterable, Mistrust and Enmity have burst the bands Of social peace: and listening Treachery lurks With pious fraud to snare a brother's life; And childless widows o'er the groaning land Wail numberless; and orphans weep for bread! Thee to defend, dear Saviour of Mankind! Thee, Lamb of God! Thee, blameless Prince of Peace! From all sides rush the thirsty brood of War!— Austria, and that foul Woman of the North, The lustful murderess of her wedded lord! And he, connatural Mind! whom (in their songs So bards of elder time had haply feigned) Some Fury fondled in her hate to man, Bidding her serpent hair in mazy surge Lick his young face, and at his mouth imbreathe Horrible sympathy! And leagued with these Each petty German princeling, nursed in gore! Soul-hardened barterers of human blood! Death's prime slave-merchants! Scorpion-whips of Fate! Nor least in savagery of holy zeal, Apt for the yoke, the race degenerate, Whom Britain erst had blushed to call her sons! Thee to defend the Moloch Priest prefers The prayer of hate, and bellows to the herd, That Deity, Accomplice Deity In the fierce jealousy of wakened wrath Will go forth with our armies and our fleets To scatter the red ruin on their foes! O blasphemy! to mingle fiendish deeds With blessedness! Lord of unsleeping Love, From everlasting Thou! We shall not die. These, even these, in mercy didst thou form, Teachers of Good through Evil, by brief wrong Making Truth lovely, and her future might Magnetic o'er the fixed untrembling heart. In the primeval age a dateless while The vacant Shepherd wander'd with his flock, Pitching his tent where'er the green grass waved. But soon Imagination conjured up An host of new desires: with busy aim, Each for himself, Earth's eager children toiled. So Property began, twy-streaming fount, Whence Vice and Virtue flow, honey and gall. Hence the soft couch, and many-coloured robe, The timbrel, and arched dome and costly feast, With all the inventive arts, that nursed the soul To forms of beauty, and by sensual wants Unsensualised the mind, which in the means Learnt to forget the grossness of the end, Best pleasured with its own activity. And hence Disease that withers manhood's arm, The daggered Envy, spirit-quenching Want, Warriors, and Lords, and Priests—all the sore ills That vex and desolate our mortal life. Wide-wasting ills! yet each the immediate source Of mightier good. Their keen necessities To ceaseless action goading human thought Have made Earth's reasoning animal her Lord; And the pale-featured Sage's trembling hand Strong as an host of arméd Deities, Such as the blind Ionian fabled erst. From Avarice thus, from Luxury and War Sprang heavenly Science; and from Science Freedom. O'er waken'd realms Philosophers and Bards Spread in concentric circles: they whose souls, Conscious of their high dignities from God, Brook not Wealth's rivalry! and they, who long Enamoured with the charms of order, hate The unseemly disproportion: and whoe'er Turn with mild sorrow from the Victor's car And the low puppetry of thrones, to muse On that blest triumph, when the Patriot Sage Called the red lightnings from the o'er-rushing cloud And dashed the beauteous terrors on the earth Smiling majestic. Such a phalanx ne'er Measured firm paces to the calming sound Of Spartan flute! These on the fated day, When, stung to rage by Pity, eloquent men Have roused with pealing voice the unnumbered tribes That toil and groan and bleed, hungry and blind— These, hush'd awhile with patient eye serene, Shall watch the mad careering of the storm; Then o'er the wild and wavy chaos rush And tame the outrageous mass, with plastic might Moulding Confusion to such perfect forms, As erst were wont,—bright visions of the day!— To float before them, when, the summer noon, Beneath some arched romantic rock reclined They felt the sea-breeze lift their youthful locks; Or in the month of blossoms, at mild eve, Wandering with desultory feet inhaled The wafted perfumes, and the flocks and woods And many-tinted streams and setting sun With all his gorgeous company of clouds Ecstatic gazed! then homeward as they strayed Cast the sad eye to earth, and inly mused Why there was misery in a world so fair. Ah! far removed from all that glads the sense, From all that softens or ennobles Man, The wretched Many! Bent beneath their loads They gape at pageant Power, nor recognise Their cots' transmuted plunder! From the tree Of Knowledge, ere the vernal sap had risen Rudely disbranchéd! Blessed Society! Fitliest depictured by some sun-scorched waste, Where oft majestic through the tainted noon The Simoom sails, before whose purple pomp Who falls not prostrate dies! And where by night, Fast by each precious fountain on green herbs The lion couches: or hyaena dips Deep in the lucid stream his bloody jaws; Or serpent plants his vast moon-glittering bulk, Caught in whose monstrous twine Behemoth yells, His bones loud-crashing! O ye numberless, Whom foul Oppression's ruffian gluttony Drives from Life's plenteous feast! O thou poor Wretch Who nursed in darkness and made wild by want, Roamest for prey, yea thy unnatural hand Dost lift to deeds of blood! O pale-eyed form, The victim of seduction, doomed to know Polluted nights and days of blasphemy; Who in loathed orgies with lewd wassailers Must gaily laugh, while thy remembered Home Gnaws like a viper at thy secret heart! O agéd Women! ye who weekly catch The morsel tossed by law-forced charity, And die so slowly, that none call it murder! O loathly suppliants! ye, that unreceived Totter heart-broken from the closing gates Of the full Lazar-house; or, gazing, stand, Sick with despair! O ye to Glory's field Forced or ensnared, who, as ye gasp in death, Bleed with new wounds beneath the vulture's beak! O thou poor widow, who in dreams dost view Thy husband's mangled corse, and from short doze Start'st with a shriek; or in thy half-thatched cot Waked by the wintry night-storm, wet and cold Cow'rst o'er thy screaming baby! Rest awhile Children of Wretchedness! More groans must rise, More blood must stream, or ere your wrongs be full. Yet is the day of Retribution nigh: The Lamb of God hath opened the fifth seal: And upward rush on swiftest wing of fire The innumerable multitude of wrongs By man on man inflicted! Rest awhile, Children of Wretchedness! The hour is nigh And lo! the Great, the Rich, the Mighty Men, The Kings and the Chief Captains of the World, With all that fixed on high like stars of Heaven Shot baleful influence, shall be cast to earth, Vile and down-trodden, as the untimely fruit Shook from the fig-tree by a sudden storm. Even now the storm begins: each gentle name, Faith and meek Piety, with fearful joy Tremble far-off—for lo! the Giant Frenzy Uprooting empires with his whirlwind arm Mocketh high Heaven; burst hideous from the cell Where the old Hag, unconquerable, huge, Creation's eyeless drudge, black Ruin, sits Nursing the impatient earthquake. O return! Pure Faith! meek Piety! The abhorréd Form Whose scarlet robe was stiff with earthly pomp, Who drank iniquity in cups of gold, Whose names were many and all blasphemous, Hath met the horrible judgment! Whence that cry? The mighty army of foul Spirits shrieked Disherited of earth! For she hath fallen On whose black front was written Mystery; She that reeled heavily, whose wine was blood; She that worked whoredom with the Daemon Power, And from the dark embrace all evil things Brought forth and nurtured: mitred Atheism! And patient Folly who on bended knee Gives back the steel that stabbed him; and pale Fear Haunted by ghastlier shapings than surround Moon-blasted Madness when he yells at midnight! Return pure Faith! return meek Piety! The kingdoms of the world are your's: each heart Self-governed, the vast family of Love Raised from the common earth by common toil Enjoy the equal produce. Such delights As float to earth, permitted visitants! When in some hour of solemn jubilee The massy gates of Paradise are thrown Wide open, and forth come in fragments wild Sweet echoes of unearthly melodies, And odours snatched from beds of Amaranth, And they, that from the crystal river of life Spring up on freshened wing, ambrosial gales! The favoured good man in his lonely walk Perceives them, and his silent spirit drinks Strange bliss which he shall recognise in heaven. And such delights, such strange beatitudes Seize on my young anticipating heart When that blest future rushes on my view! For in his own and in his Father's might The Saviour comes! While as the Thousand Years Lead up their mystic dance, the Desert shouts! Old Ocean claps his hands! The mighty Dead Rise to new life, whoe'er from earliest time With conscious zeal had urged Love's wondrous plan, Coadjutors of God. To Milton's trump The high groves of the renovated Earth Unbosom their glad echoes: inly hushed, Adoring Newton his serener eye Raises to heaven: and he of mortal kind Wisest, he first who marked the ideal tribes Up the fine fibres through the sentient brain. Lo! Priestley there, patriot, and saint, and sage, Him, full of years, from his loved native land Statesmen blood-stained and priests idolatrous By dark lies maddening the blind multitude Drove with vain hate. Calm, pitying he retired, And mused expectant on these promised years. O Years! the blest pre-eminence of Saints! Ye sweep athwart my gaze, so heavenly bright, The wings that veil the adoring Seraphs' eyes, What time they bend before the Jasper Throne Reflect no lovelier hues! Yet ye depart, And all beyond is darkness! Heights most strange, Whence Fancy falls, fluttering her idle wing. For who of woman born may paint the hour, When seized in his mid course, the Sun shall wane Making noon ghastly! Who of woman born May image in the workings of his thought, How the black-visaged, red-eyed Fiend outstretched Beneath the unsteady feet of Nature groans, In feverous slumbers—destined then to wake, When fiery whirlwinds thunder his dread name And Angels shout, Destruction! How his arm The last great Spirit lifting high in air Shall swear by Him, the ever-living One, Time is no more! Believe thou, O my soul, Life is a vision shadowy of Truth; And vice, and anguish, and the wormy grave, Shapes of a dream! The veiling clouds retire, And lo! the Throne of the redeeming God Forth flashing unimaginable day Wraps in one blaze earth, heaven, and deepest hell. Contemplant Spirits! ye that hover o'er With untired gaze the immeasurable fount Ebullient with creative Deity! And ye of plastic power, that interfused Roll through the grosser and material mass In organizing surge! Holies of God! (And what if Monads of the infinite mind?) I haply journeying my immortal course Shall sometime join your mystic choir! Till then I discipline my young and novice thought In ministeries of heart-stirring song, And aye on Meditation's heaven-ward wing Soaring aloft I breathe the empyreal air Of Love, omnific, omnipresent Love, Whose day-spring rises glorious in my soul As the great Sun, when he his influence Sheds on the frost-bound waters—The glad stream Flows to the ray and warbles as it flows. 1794–1796. MONODY ON THE DEATH OF CHATTERTON O what a wonder seems the fear of death, Seeing how gladly we all sink to sleep, Babes, Children, Youths, and Men, Night following night for threescore years and ten! But doubly strange, where life is but a breath To sigh and pant with, up Want's rugged steep. Away, Grim Phantom! Scorpion King, away! Reserve thy terrors and thy stings display For coward Wealth and Guilt in robes of State! Lo! by the grave I stand of one, for whom A prodigal Nature and a niggard Doom (That all bestowing, this withholding all) Made each chance knell from distant spire or dome Sound like a seeking Mother's anxious call, Return, poor Child! Home, weary Truant, home! Thee, Chatterton! these unblest stones protect From want, and the bleak freezings of neglect. Too long before the vexing Storm-blast driven Here hast thou found repose! beneath this sod! Thou! O vain word! thou dwell'st not with the clod! Amid the shining Host of the Forgiven Thou at the throne of mercy and thy God The triumph of redeeming Love dost hymn (Believe it, O my Soul!) to harps of Seraphim. Yet oft, perforce ('tis suffering Nature's call), I weep that heaven-born Genius so should fall; And oft, in Fancy's saddest hour, my soul Averted shudders at the poison'd bowl. Now groans my sickening heart, as still I view Thy corse of livid hue; Now Indignation checks the feeble sigh, Or flashes through the tear that glistens in mine eye! Is this the land of song-ennobled line? Is this the land, where Genius ne'er in vain Pour'd forth his lofty strain? Ah me! yet Spenser, gentlest bard divine, Beneath chill Disappointment's shade, His weary limbs in lonely anguish lay'd. And o'er her darling dead Pity hopeless hung her head, While ‘mid the pelting of that merciless storm,’ Sunk to the cold earth Otway's famish'd form! Sublime of thought, and confident of fame, From vales where Avon winds the Minstrel came. Light-hearted youth! aye, as he hastes along, He meditates the future song, How dauntless Ælla fray'd the Dacyan foe; And while the numbers flowing strong In eddies whirl, in surges throng, Exulting in the spirits' genial throe In tides of power his life-blood seems to flow. And now his cheeks with deeper ardors flame, His eyes have glorious meanings, that declare More than the light of outward day shines there, A holier triumph and a sterner aim! Wings grow within him; and he soars above Or Bard's or Minstrel's lay of war or love. Friend to the friendless, to the sufferer health, He hears the widow's prayer, the good man's praise; To scenes of bliss transmutes his fancied wealth, And young and old shall now see happy days. On many a waste he bids trim gardens rise, Gives the blue sky to many a prisoner's eyes; And now in wrath he grasps the patriot steel, And her own iron rod he makes Oppression feel. Sweet Flower of Hope! free Nature's genial child! That didst so fair disclose thy early bloom, Filling the wide air with a rich perfume! For thee in vain all heavenly aspects smil'd; From the hard world brief respite could they win— The frost nipp'd sharp without, the canker prey'd within! Ah! where are fled the charms of vernal Grace, And Joy's wild gleams that lighten'd o'er thy face? Youth of tumultuous soul, and haggard eye! Thy wasted form, thy hurried steps I view, On thy wan forehead starts the lethal dew, And oh! the anguish of that shuddering sigh! Such were the struggles of the gloomy hour, When Care, of wither'd brow, Prepar'd the poison's death-cold power: Already to thy lips was rais'd the bowl, When near thee stood Affection meek (Her bosom bare, and wildly pale her cheek) Thy sullen gaze she bade thee roll On scenes that well might melt thy soul; Thy native cot she flash'd upon thy view, Thy native cot, where still, at close of day, Peace smiling sate, and listen'd to thy lay; Thy Sister's shrieks she bade thee hear, And mark thy Mother's thrilling tear; See, see her breast's convulsive throe, Her silent agony of woe! Ah! dash the poison'd chalice from thy hand! And thou hadst dashed it, at her soft command, But that Despair and Indignation rose, And told again the story of thy woes; Told the keen insult of the unfeeling heart, The dread dependence on the low-born mind; Told every pang, with which thy soul must smart, Neglect, and grinning Scorn, and Want combined! Recoiling quick, thou badest the friend of pain Roll the black tide of Death through every freezing vein! O spirit blest! Whether the Eternal's throne around, Amidst the blaze of Seraphim, Thou pourest forth the grateful hymn, Or soaring thro' the blest domain Enrapturest Angels with thy strain,— Grant me, like thee, the lyre to sound, Like thee with fire divine to glow;— But ah! when rage the waves of woe, Grant me with firmer breast to meet their hate, And soar beyond the storm with upright eye elate! Ye woods! that wave o'er Avon's rocky steep, To Fancy's ear sweet is your murmuring deep! For here she loves the cypress wreath to weave; Watching with wistful eye, the saddening tints of eve. Here, far from men, amid this pathless grove, In solemn thought the Minstrel wont to rove, Like star-beam on the slow sequester'd tide Lone-glittering, through the high tree branching wide. And here, in Inspiration's eager hour, When most the big soul feels the mastering power, These wilds, these caverns roaming o'er, Round which the screaming sea-gulls soar, With wild unequal steps he pass'd along, Oft pouring on the winds a broken song: Anon, upon some rough rock's fearful brow Would pause abrupt—and gaze upon the waves below. Poor Chatterton! he sorrows for thy fate Who would have prais'd and lov'd thee, ere too late. Poor Chatterton! farewell! of darkest hues This chaplet cast I on thy unshaped tomb; But dare no longer on the sad theme muse, Lest kindred woes persuade a kindred doom: For oh! big gall-drops, shook from Folly's wing, Have blacken'd the fair promise of my spring; And the stern Fate transpierc'd with viewless dart The last pale Hope that shiver'd at my heart! Hence, gloomy thoughts! no more my soul shall dwell On joys that were! no more endure to weigh The shame and anguish of the evil day, Wisely forgetful! O'er the ocean swell Sublime of Hope I seek the cottag'd dell Where Virtue calm with careless step may stray; And, dancing to the moon-light roundelay, The wizard Passions weave an holy spell! O Chatterton! that thou wert yet alive! Sure thou would'st spread the canvass to the gale, And love with us the tinkling team to drive O'er peaceful Freedom's undivided dale; And we, at sober eve, would round thee throng, Would hang, enraptur'd, on thy stately song, And greet with smiles the young-eyed Poesy All deftly mask'd as hoar Antiquity. Alas, vain Phantasies! the fleeting brood Of Woe self-solac'd in her dreamy mood! Yet will I love to follow the sweet dream, Where Susquehannah pours his untamed stream; And on some hill, whose forest-frowning side Waves o'er the murmurs of his calmer tide, Will raise a solemn Cenotaph to thee, Sweet Harper of time-shrouded Minstrelsy! And there, sooth'd sadly by the dirgeful wind, Muse on the sore ills I had left behind. 1790–1834. THE DESTINY OF NATIONS A VISION Auspicious Reverence! Hush all meaner song, Ere we the deep preluding strain have poured To the Great Father, only Rightful King, Eternal Father! King Omnipotent! To the Will Absolute, the One, the Good! The I AM, the Word, the Life, the Living God! Such symphony requires best instrument. Seize, then, my soul! from Freedom's trophied dome The Harp which hangeth high between the Shields Of Brutus and Leonidas! With that Strong music, that soliciting spell, force back Man's free and stirring spirit that lies entranced. For what is Freedom, but the unfettered use Of all the powers which God for use had given? But chiefly this, him First, him Last to view Through meaner powers and secondary things Effulgent, as through clouds that veil his blaze. For all that meets the bodily sense I deem Symbolical, one mighty alphabet For infant minds; and we in this low world Placed with our backs to bright Reality, That we may learn with young unwounded ken The substance from its shadow. Infinite Love, Whose latence is the plenitude of All, Thou with retracted beams, and self-eclipse Veiling, revealest thine eternal Sun. But some there are who deem themselves most free When they within this gross and visible sphere Chain down the wingéd thought, scoffing ascent, Proud in their meanness: and themselves they cheat With noisy emptiness of learnéd phrase, Their subtle fluids, impacts, essences, Self-working tools, uncaused effects, and all Those blind Omniscients, those Almighty Slaves, Untenanting creation of its God. But Properties are God: the naked mass (If mass there be, fantastic guess or ghost) Acts only by its inactivity. Here we pause humbly. Others boldlier think That as one body seems the aggregate Of atoms numberless, each organized; So by a strange and dim similitude Infinite myriads of self-conscious minds Are one all-conscious Spirit, which informs With absolute ubiquity of thought (His one eternal self-affirming act!) All his involvéd Monads, that yet seem With various province and apt agency Each to pursue its own self-centering end. Some nurse the infant diamond in the mine; Some roll the genial juices through the oak; Some drive the mutinous clouds to clash in air, And rushing on the storm with whirlwind speed, Yoke the red lightnings to their volleying car. Thus these pursue their never-varying course, No eddy in their stream. Others, more wild, With complex interests weaving human fates, Duteous or proud, alike obedient all, Evolve the process of eternal good. And what if some rebellious, o'er dark realms Arrogate power? yet these train up to God, And on the rude eye, unconfirmed for day, Flash meteor-lights better than total gloom. As ere from Lieule-Oaive's vapoury head The Laplander beholds the far-off Sun Dart his slant beam on unobeying snows, While yet the stern and solitary Night Brooks no alternate sway, the Boreal Morn With mimic lustre substitutes its gleam, Guiding his course or by Niemi lake Or Balda Zhiok, or the mossy stone Of Solfar-kapper, while the snowy blast Drifts arrowy by, or eddies round his sledge, Making the poor babe at its mother's back Scream in its scanty cradle: he the while Wins gentle solace as with upward eye He marks the streamy banners of the North, Thinking himself those happy spirits shall join Who there in floating robes of rosy light Dance sportively. For Fancy is the power That first unsensualises the dark mind, Giving it new delights; and bids it swell With wild activity; and peopling air, By obscure fears of Beings invisible, Emancipates it from the grosser thrall Of the present impulse, teaching Self-control, Till Superstition with unconscious hand Seat Reason on her throne. Wherefore not vain, Nor yet without permitted power impressed, I deem those legends terrible, with which The polar ancient thrills his uncouth throng: Whether of pitying Spirits that make their moan O'er slaughter'd infants, or that Giant Bird Vuokho, of whose rushing wings the noise Is Tempest, when the unutterable Shape Speeds from the mother of Death, and utters once That shriek, which never murderer heard, and lived. Or if the Greenland Wizard in strange trance Pierces the untravelled realms of Ocean's bed Over the abysm, even to that uttermost cave By mis-shaped prodigies beleaguered, such As Earth ne'er bred, nor Air, nor the upper Sea: Where dwells the Fury Form, whose unheard name With eager eye, pale cheek, suspended breath, And lips half-opening with the dread of sound, Unsleeping Silence guards, worn out with fear Lest haply 'scaping on some treacherous blast The fateful word let slip the Elements And frenzy Nature. Yet the wizard her, Arm'd with Torngarsuck's power, the Spirit of Good, Forces to unchain the foodful progeny Of the Ocean stream;—thence thro' the realm of Souls, Where live the Innocent, as far from cares As from the storms and overwhelming waves That tumble on the surface of the Deep, Returns with far-heard pant, hotly pursued By the fierce Warders of the Sea, once more, Ere by the frost foreclosed, to repossess His fleshly mansion, that had staid the while In the dark tent within a cow'ring group Untenanted.—Wild phantasies! yet wise, On the victorious goodness of high God Teaching reliance, and medicinal hope, Till from Bethabra northward, heavenly Truth With gradual steps, winning her difficult way, Transfer their rude Faith perfected and pure. If there be Beings of higher class than Man, I deem no nobler province they possess, Than by disposal of apt circumstance To rear up kingdoms: and the deeds they prompt, Distinguishing from mortal agency, They choose their human ministers from such states As still the Epic song half fears to name, Repelled from all the minstrelsies that strike The palace-roof and soothe the monarch's pride. And such, perhaps, the Spirit, who (if words Witnessed by answering deeds may claim our faith) Held commune with that warrior-maid of France Who scourged the Invader. From her infant days, With Wisdom, mother of retired thoughts, Her soul had dwelt; and she was quick to mark The good and evil thing, in human lore Undisciplined. For lowly was her birth, And Heaven had doomed her early years to toil That pure from Tyranny's least deed, herself Unfeared by Fellow-natures, she might wait On the poor labouring man with kindly looks, And minister refreshment to the tired Way-wanderer, when along the rough-hewn bench The sweltry man had stretched him, and aloft Vacantly watched the rudely-pictured board Which on the Mulberry-bough with welcome creak Swung to the pleasant breeze. Here, too, the Maid Learnt more than Schools could teach: Man's shifting mind, His vices and his sorrows! And full oft At tales of cruel wrong and strange distress Had wept and shivered. To the tottering Eld Still as a daughter would she run: she placed His cold limbs at the sunny door, and loved To hear him story, in his garrulous sort, Of his eventful years, all come and gone. So twenty seasons past. The Virgin's form, Active and tall, nor Sloth nor Luxury Had shrunk or paled. Her front sublime and broad, Her flexile eye-brows wildly haired and low, And her full eye, now bright, now unillumed, Spake more than Woman's thought; and all her face Was moulded to such features as declared That Pity there had oft and strongly worked, And sometimes Indignation. Bold her mien, And like an haughty huntress of the woods She moved: yet sure she was a gentle maid! And in each motion her most innocent soul Beamed forth so brightly, that who saw would say Guilt was a thing impossible in her! Nor idly would have said—for she had lived In this bad World, as in a place of Tombs, And touched not the pollutions of the Dead. 'Twas the cold season when the Rustic's eye From the drear desolate whiteness of his fields Rolls for relief to watch the skiey tints And clouds slow-varying their huge imagery; When now, as she was wont, the healthful Maid Had left her pallet ere one beam of day Slanted the fog-smoke. She went forth alone Urged by the indwelling angel-guide, that oft, With dim inexplicable sympathies Disquieting the heart, shapes out Man's course To the predoomed adventure. Now the ascent She climbs of that steep upland, on whose top The Pilgrim-man, who long since eve had watched The alien shine of unconcerning stars, Shouts to himself, there first the Abbey-lights Seen in Neufchâtel's vale; now slopes adown The winding sheep-track vale-ward: when, behold In the first entrance of the level road An unattended team! The foremost horse Lay with stretched limbs; the others, yet alive But stiff and cold, stood motionless, their manes Hoar with the frozen night-dews. Dismally The dark-red dawn now glimmered; but its gleams Disclosed no face of man. The maiden paused, Then hailed who might be near. No voice replied. From the thwart wain at length there reached her ear A sound so feeble that it almost seemed Distant: and feebly, with slow effort pushed, A miserable man crept forth: his limbs The silent frost had eat, scathing like fire. Faint on the shafts he rested. She, meantime, Saw crowded close beneath the coverture A mother and her children—lifeless all, Yet lovely! not a lineament was marred— Death had put on so slumber-like a form! It was a piteous sight; and one, a babe, The crisp milk frozen on its innocent lips, Lay on the woman's arm, its little hand Stretched on her bosom. Mutely questioning, The Maid gazed wildly at the living wretch. He, his head feebly turning, on the group Looked with a vacant stare, and his eye spoke The drowsy calm that steals on worn-out anguish. She shuddered; but, each vainer pang subdued, Quick disentangling from the foremost horse The rustic bands, with difficulty and toil The stiff cramped team forced homeward. There arrived, Anxiously tends him she with healing herbs, And weeps and prays—but the numb power of Death Spreads o'er his limbs; and ere the noon-tide hour, The hovering spirits of his Wife and Babes Hail him immortal! Yet amid his pangs, With interruptions long from ghastly throes, His voice had faltered out this simple tale. The Village, where he dwelt an husbandman, By sudden inroad had been seized and fired Late on the yester-evening. With his wife And little ones he hurried his escape. They saw the neighbouring hamlets flame, they heard Uproar and shrieks! and terror-struck drove on Through unfrequented roads, a weary way! But saw nor house nor cottage. All had quenched Their evening hearth-fire: for the alarm had spread. The air clipt keen, the night was fanged with frost, And they provisionless! The weeping wife Ill hushed her children's moans; and still they moaned, Till Fright and Cold and Hunger drank their life. They closed their eyes in sleep, nor knew 'twas Death. He only, lashing his o'er-wearied team, Gained a sad respite, till beside the base Of the high hill his foremost horse dropped dead. Then hopeless, strengthless, sick for lack of food, He crept beneath the coverture, entranced, Till wakened by the maiden.—Such his tale. Ah! suffering to the height of what was suffered, Stung with too keen a sympathy, the Maid Brooded with moving lips, mute, startful, dark! And now her flushed tumultuous features shot Such strange vivacity, as fires the eye Of Misery fancy-crazed! and now once more Naked, and void, and fixed, and all within The unquiet silence of confuséd thought And shapeless feelings. For a mighty hand Was strong upon her, till in the heat of soul To the high hill-top tracing back her steps, Aside the beacon, up whose smouldered stones The tender ivy-trails crept thinly, there, Unconscious of the driving element, Yea, swallowed up in the ominous dream, she sate Ghastly as broad-eyed Slumber! a dim anguish Breathed from her look! and still with pant and sob, Inly she toiled to flee, and still subdued, Felt an inevitable Presence near. Thus as she toiled in troublous ecstasy, A horror of great darkness wrapt her round, And a voice uttered forth unearthly tones, Calming her soul,—‘O Thou of the Most High Chosen, whom all the perfected in Heaven Behold expectant—’ [The following fragments were intended to form part of the poem when finished.] ‘Maid beloved of Heaven! (To her the tutelary Power exclaimed) Of Chaos the adventurous progeny Thou seest; foul missionaries of foul sire, Fierce to regain the losses of that hour When Love rose glittering, and his gorgeous wings Over the abyss fluttered with such glad noise, As what time after long and pestful calms, With slimy shapes and miscreated life Poisoning the vast Pacific, the fresh breeze Wakens the merchant-sail uprising. Night An heavy unimaginable moan Sent forth, when she the Protoplast beheld Stand beauteous on Confusion's charméd wave. Moaning she fled, and entered the Profound That leads with downward windings to the Cave Of Darkness palpable, Desert of Death Sunk deep beneath Gehenna's massy roots. There many a dateless age the Beldame lurked And trembled; till engendered by fierce Hate, Fierce Hate and gloomy Hope, a Dream arose, Shaped like a black cloud marked with streaks of fire. It roused the Hell-Hag: she the dew-damp wiped From off her brow, and through the uncouth maze Retraced her steps; but ere she reached the mouth Of that drear labyrinth, shuddering she paused, Nor dared re-enter the diminished Gulph. As through the dark vaults of some mouldered Tower (Which, fearful to approach, the evening hind Circles at distance in his homeward way) The winds breathe hollow, deemed the plaining groan Of prisoned spirits; with such fearful voice Night murmured, and the sound through Chaos went. Leaped at her call her hideous-fronted brood! A dark behest they heard, and rushed on earth; Since that sad hour, in Camps and Courts adored, Rebels from God, and Tyrants o'er Mankind!’ From his obscure haunt Shrieked Fear, of Cruelty the ghastly Dam, Feverous yet freezing, eager-paced yet slow, As she that creeps from forth her swampy reeds, Ague, the biform Hag! when early Spring Beams on the marsh-bred vapours. ‘Even so (the exulting Maiden said) The sainted Heralds of Good Tidings fell, And thus they witnessed God! But now the clouds Treading, and storms beneath their feet, they soar Higher, and higher soar, and soaring sing Loud songs of triumph! O ye Spirits of God, Hover around my mortal agonies!’ She spake, and instantly faint melody Melts on her ear, soothing and sad, and slow, Such measures, as at calmest midnight heard By agéd Hermit in his holy dream, Foretell and solace death; and now they rise Louder, as when with harp and mingled voice The white-robed multitude of slaughtered saints At Heaven's wide-open'd portals gratulant Receive some martyred patriot. The harmony Entranced the Maid, till each suspended sense Brief slumber seized, and confused ecstasy. At length awakening slow, she gazed around: And through a mist, the relict of that trance Still thinning as she gazed, an Isle appeared, Its high, o'er-hanging, white, broad-breasted cliffs, Glassed on the subject ocean. A vast plain Stretched opposite, where ever and anon The plough-man following sad his meagre team Turned up fresh sculls unstartled, and the bones Of fierce hate-breathing combatants, who there All mingled lay beneath the common earth, Death's gloomy reconcilement! O'er the fields Stept a fair Form, repairing all she might, Her temples olive-wreathed; and where she trod, Fresh flowerets rose, and many a foodful herb. But wan her cheek, her footsteps insecure, And anxious pleasure beamed in her faint eye, As she had newly left a couch of pain, Pale Convalescent! (Yet some time to rule With power exclusive o'er the willing world, That blessed prophetic mandate then fulfilled— Peace be on Earth!) An happy while, but brief, She seemed to wander with assiduous feet, And healed the recent harm of chill and blight, And nursed each plant that fair and virtuous grew. But soon a deep precursive sound moaned hollow: Black rose the clouds, and now, (as in a dream) Their reddening shapes, transformed to Warrior-hosts, Coursed o'er the sky, and battled in mid-air. Nor did not the large blood-drops fall from Heaven Portentous! while aloft were seen to float, Like hideous features looming on the mist, Wan stains of ominous light! Resigned, yet sad, The fair Form bowed her olive-crownéd brow, Then o'er the plain with oft-reverted eye Fled till a place of Tombs she reached, and there Within a ruined Sepulchre obscure Found hiding-place. The delegated Maid Gazed through her tears, then in sad tones exclaimed;— ‘Thou mild-eyed Form! wherefore, ah! wherefore fled? The Power of Justice like a name all light, Shone from thy brow; but all they, who unblamed Dwelt in thy dwellings, call thee Happiness. Ah! why, uninjured and unprofited, Should multitudes against their brethren rush? Why sow they guilt, still reaping misery? Lenient of care, thy songs, O Peace! are sweet, As after showers the perfumed gale of eve, That flings the cool drops on a feverous cheek; And gay thy grassy altar piled with fruits. But boasts the shrine of Dæmon War one charm, Save that with many an orgie strange and foul, Dancing around with interwoven arms, The Maniac Suicide and Giant Murder Exult in their fierce union! I am sad, And know not why the simple peasants crowd Beneath the Chieftains' standard!’ Thus the Maid. To her the tutelary Spirit said: ‘When Luxury and Lust's exhausted stores No more can rouse the appetites of kings; When the low flattery of their reptile lords Falls flat and heavy on the accustomed ear; When eunuchs sing, and fools buffoonery make, And dancers writhe their harlot-limbs in vain; Then War and all its dread vicissitudes Pleasingly agitate their stagnant hearts; Its hopes, its fears, its victories, its defeats, Insipid Royalty's keen condiment! Therefore uninjured and unprofited (Victims at once and executioners), The congregated Husbandmen lay waste The vineyard and the harvest. As along The Bothnic coast, or southward of the Line, Though hushed the winds and cloudless the high noon, Yet if Leviathan, weary of ease, In sports unwieldy toss his island-bulk, Ocean behind him billows, and before A storm of waves breaks foamy on the strand. And hence, for times and seasons bloody and dark, Short Peace shall skin the wounds of causeless War, And War, his strainéd sinews knit anew, Still violate the unfinished works of Peace. But yonder look! for more demands thy view!’ He said: and straightway from the opposite Isle A vapour sailed, as when a cloud, exhaled From Egypt's fields that steam hot pestilence, Travels the sky for many a trackless league, Till o'er some death-doomed land, distant in vain, It broods incumbent. Forthwith from the plain, Facing the Isle, a brighter cloud arose, And steered its course which way the vapour went. The Maiden paused, musing what this might mean. But long time passed not, ere that brighter cloud Returned more bright; along the plain it swept; And soon from forth its bursting sides emerged A dazzling form, broad-bosomed, bold of eye, And wild her hair, save where with laurels bound. Not more majestic stood the healing God, When from his bow the arrow sped that slew Huge Python. Shriek'd Ambition's giant throng, And with them hissed the locust-fiends that crawled And glittered in Corruption's slimy track. Great was their wrath, for short they knew their reign; And such commotion made they, and uproar, As when the mad Tornado bellows through The guilty islands of the western main, What time departing from their native shores, Eboe, or Koromantyn's plain of palms, The infuriate spirits of the murdered make Fierce merriment, and vengeance ask of Heaven. Warmed with new influence, the unwholesome plain Sent up its foulest fogs to meet the morn: The Sun that rose on Freedom, rose in Blood! ‘Maiden beloved, and Delegate of Heaven! (To her the tutelary Spirit said) Soon shall the Morning struggle into Day, The stormy Morning into cloudless Noon. Much hast thou seen, nor all canst understand— But this be thy best omen—Save thy Country!’ Thus saying, from the answering Maid he passed, And with him disappeared the heavenly Vision. ‘Glory to Thee, Father of Earth and Heaven! All-conscious Presence of the Universe! Nature's vast ever-acting Energy! In will, in deed, Impulse of All to All! Whether thy Love with unrefracted ray Beam on the Prophet's purgéd eye, or if Diseasing realms the Enthusiast, wild of thought, Scatter new frenzies on the infected throng, Thou both inspiring and predooming both, Fit instruments and best, of perfect end: Glory to Thee, Father of Earth and Heaven!’ And first a landscape rose More wild and waste and desolate than where The white bear, drifting on a field of ice, Howls to her sundered cubs with piteous rage And savage agony. 1796. VER PERPETUUM FRAGMENT From an unpublished poem. The early Year's fast-flying vapours stray In shadowing trains across the orb of day: And we, poor Insects of a few short hours, Deem it a world of Gloom. Were it not better hope a nobler doom, Proud to believe that with more active powers On rapid many-coloured wing We thro' one bright perpetual Spring Shall hover round the fruits and flowers, Screen'd by those clouds and cherish'd by those showers! 1796. ON OBSERVING A BLOSSOM ON THE FIRST OF FEBRUARY 1796 Sweet flower! that peeping from thy russet stem Unfoldest timidly, (for in strange sort This dark, frieze-coated, hoarse, teeth-chattering month Hath borrow'd Zephyr's voice, and gazed upon thee With blue voluptuous eye) alas, poor Flower! These are but flatteries of the faithless year. Perchance, escaped its unknown polar cave, Even now the keen North-East is on its way. Flower that must perish! shall I liken thee To some sweet girl of too too rapid growth Nipp'd by consumption mid untimely charms? Or to Bristowa's bard, the wondrous boy! An amaranth, which earth scarce seem'd to own, Till disappointment came, and pelting wrong Beat it to earth? or with indignant grief Shall I compare thee to poor Poland's hope, Bright flower of hope killed in the opening bud? Farewell, sweet blossom! better fate be thine And mock my boding! Dim similitudes Weaving in moral strains, I've stolen one hour From anxious Self, Life's cruel taskmaster! And the warm wooings of this sunny day Tremble along my frame and harmonize The attempered organ, that even saddest thoughts Mix with some sweet sensations, like harsh tunes Played deftly on a soft-toned instrument. 1796. TO A PRIMROSE THE FIRST SEEN IN THE SEASON Nitens et roboris expers Turget et insolida est: et spe delectat. Ovid, Metam. [xv. 203]. Thy smiles I note, sweet early Flower, That peeping from thy rustic bower The festive news to earth dost bring, A fragrant messenger of Spring. But, tender blossom, why so pale? Dost hear stern Winter in the gale? And didst thou tempt the ungentle sky To catch one vernal glance and die? Such the wan lustre Sickness wears When Health's first feeble beam appears; So languid are the smiles that seek To settle on the care-worn cheek, When timorous Hope the head uprears, Still drooping and still moist with tears, If, through dispersing grief, be seen Of Bliss the heavenly spark serene. And sweeter far the early blow, Fast following after storms of Woe, Than (Comfort's riper season come) Are full-blown joys and Pleasure's gaudy bloom. 1796. VERSES ADDRESSED TO J. HORNE TOOKE AND THE COMPANY WHO MET ON JUNE 28TH, 1796, TO CELEBRATE HIS POLL AT THE WESTMINSTER ELECTION Britons! when last ye met, with distant streak So faintly promis'd the pale Dawn to break; So dim it stain'd the precincts of the Sky E'en Expectation gaz'd with doubtful Eye. But now such fair Varieties of Light O'ertake the heavy sailing Clouds of Night; Th' Horizon kindles with so rich a red, That tho' the Sun still hides his glorious head Th' impatient Matin-bird, assur'd of Day, Leaves his low nest to meet its earliest ray; Loud the sweet song of Gratulation sings, And high in air claps his rejoicing wings! Patriot and Sage! whose breeze-like Spirit first The lazy mists of Pedantry dispers'd (Mists in which Superstition's pigmy band Seem'd Giant Forms, the Genii of the Land!), Thy struggles soon shall wak'ning Britain bless, And Truth and Freedom hail thy wish'd success. Yes Tooke! tho' foul Corruption's wolfish throng Outmalice Calumny's imposthum'd Tongue, Thy Country's noblest and determin'd Choice, Soon shalt thou thrill the Senate with thy voice; With gradual Dawn bid Error's phantoms flit, Or wither with the lightning's flash of Wit; Or with sublimer mien and tones more deep, Charm sworded Justice from mysterious Sleep, ‘By violated Freedom's loud Lament, Her Lamps extinguish'd and her Temple rent; By the forc'd tears her captive Martyrs shed; By each pale Orphan's feeble cry for bread; By ravag'd Belgium's corse-impeded Flood, And Vendee steaming still with brothers' blood!’ And if amid the strong impassion'd Tale, Thy Tongue should falter and thy Lips turn pale; If transient Darkness film thy aweful Eye, And thy tir'd Bosom struggle with a sigh: Science and Freedom shall demand to hear Who practis'd on a Life so doubly dear; Infus'd the unwholesome anguish drop by drop, Pois'ning the sacred stream they could not stop! Shall bid thee with recover'd strength relate How dark and deadly is a Coward's Hate: What seeds of death by wan Confinement sown, When Prison-echoes mock'd Disease's groan! Shall bid th' indignant Father flash dismay, And drag the unnatural Villain into Day Who to the sports of his flesh'd Ruffians left Two lovely Mourners of their Sire bereft! 'Twas wrong, like this, which Rome's first Consul bore, So by th' insulted Female's name he swore Ruin (and rais'd her reeking dagger high) Not to the Tyrants but the Tyranny! 1796. ON A LATE CONNUBIAL RUPTURE IN HIGH LIFE [PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF WALES] I sigh, fair injur'd stranger! for thy fate; But what shall sighs avail thee? thy poor heart, 'Mid all the ‘pomp and circumstance’ of state, Shivers in nakedness. Unbidden, start Sad recollections of Hope's garish dream, That shaped a seraph form, and named it Love, Its hues gay-varying, as the orient beam Varies the neck of Cytherea's dove. To one soft accent of domestic joy Poor are the shouts that shake the high-arch'd dome; Those plaudits that thy public path annoy, Alas! they tell thee—Thou'rt a wretch at home! O then retire, and weep! Their very woes Solace the guiltless. Drop the pearly flood On thy sweet infant, as the full-blown rose, Surcharg'd with dew, bends o'er its neighbouring bud. And ah! that Truth some holy spell might lend To lure thy Wanderer from the Syren's power; Then bid your souls inseparably blend Like two bright dew-drops meeting in a flower. 1796. SONNET ON RECEIVING A LETTER INFORMING ME OF THE BIRTH OF A SON When they did greet me father, sudden awe Weigh'd down my spirit: I retired and knelt Seeking the throne of grace, but inly felt No heavenly visitation upwards draw My feeble mind, nor cheering ray impart. Ah me! before the Eternal Sire I brought Th' unquiet silence of confuséd thought And shapeless feelings: my o'erwhelméd heart Trembled, and vacant tears stream'd down my face. And now once more, O Lord! to thee I bend, Lover of souls! and groan for future grace, That ere my babe youth's perilous maze have trod, Thy overshadowing Spirit may descend, And he be born again, a child of God. Sept. 20, 1796. SONNET COMPOSED ON A JOURNEY HOMEWARD; THE AUTHOR HAVING RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE OF THE BIRTH OF A SON, SEPT. 20, 1796 Oft o'er my brain does that strange fancy roll Which makes the present (while the flash doth last) Seem a mere semblance of some unknown past, Mixed with such feelings, as perplex the soul Self-questioned in her sleep; and some have said We liv'd, ere yet this robe of flesh we wore. O my sweet baby! when I reach my door, If heavy looks should tell me thou art dead, (As sometimes, through excess of hope, I fear) I think that I should struggle to believe Thou wert a spirit, to this nether sphere Sentenc'd for some more venial crime to grieve; Did'st scream, then spring to meet Heaven's quick reprieve, While we wept idly o'er thy little bier! 1796. SONNET TO A FRIEND WHO ASKED, HOW I FELT WHEN THE NURSE FIRST PRESENTED MY INFANT TO ME Charles! my slow heart was only sad, when first I scann'd that face of feeble infancy: For dimly on my thoughtful spirit burst All I had been, and all my child might be! But when I saw it on its mother's arm, And hanging at her bosom (she the while Bent o'er its features with a tearful smile) Then I was thrill'd and melted, and most warm Impress'd a father's kiss: and all beguil'd Of dark remembrance and presageful fear, I seem'd to see an angel-form appear— 'Twas even thine, belovéd woman mild! So for the mother's sake the child was dear, And dearer was the mother for the child. 1796. SONNET [TO CHARLES LLOYD] The piteous sobs that choke the Virgin's breath For him, the fair betrothéd Youth, who lies Cold in the narrow dwelling, or the cries With which a Mother wails her darling's death, These from our nature's common impulse spring, Unblam'd, unprais'd; but o'er the piléd earth Which hides the sheeted corse of grey-hair'd Worth, If droops the soaring Youth with slacken'd wing; If he recall in saddest minstrelsy Each tenderness bestow'd, each truth imprest, Such grief is Reason, Virtue, Piety! And from the Almighty Father shall descend Comforts on his late evening, whose young breast Mourns with no transient love the Agéd Friend. 1796. TO A YOUNG FRIEND ON HIS PROPOSING TO DOMESTICATE WITH THE AUTHOR Composed in 1796 A mount, not wearisome and bare and steep, But a green mountain variously up-piled, Where o'er the jutting rocks soft mosses creep, Or colour'd lichens with slow oozing weep; Where cypress and the darker yew start wild; And, 'mid the summer torrent's gentle dash Dance brighten'd the red clusters of the ash; Beneath whose boughs, by those still sounds beguil'd, Calm Pensiveness might muse herself to sleep; Till haply startled by some fleecy dam, That rustling on the bushy cliff above With melancholy bleat of anxious love, Made meek enquiry for her wandering lamb: Such a green mountain 'twere most sweet to climb, E'en while the bosom ach'd with loneliness— How more than sweet, if some dear friend should bless The adventurous toil, and up the path sublime Now lead, now follow: the glad landscape round, Wide and more wide, increasing without bound! O then 'twere loveliest sympathy, to mark The berries of the half-uprooted ash Dripping and bright; and list the torrent's dash,— Beneath the cypress, or the yew more dark, Seated at ease, on some smooth mossy rock; In social silence now, and now to unlock The treasur'd heart; arm linked in friendly arm, Save if the one, his muse's witching charm Muttering brow-bent, at unwatch'd distance lag; Till high o'er head his beckoning friend appears, And from the forehead of the topmost crag Shouts eagerly: for haply there uprears That shadowing Pine its old romantic limbs, Which latest shall detain the enamour'd sight Seen from below, when eve the valley dims, Tinged yellow with the rich departing light; And haply, bason'd in some unsunn'd cleft, A beauteous spring, the rock's collected tears, Sleeps shelter'd there, scarce wrinkled by the gale! Together thus, the world's vain turmoil left, Stretch'd on the crag, and shadow'd by the pine, And bending o'er the clear delicious fount, Ah! dearest youth! it were a lot divine To cheat our noons in moralising mood, While west-winds fann'd our temples toil-bedew'd: Then downwards slope, oft pausing, from the mount, To some lone mansion, in some woody dale, Where smiling with blue eye, Domestic Bliss Gives this the Husband's, that the Brother's kiss! Thus rudely vers'd in allegoric lore, The Hill of Knowledge I essayed to trace; That verdurous hill with many a resting-place, And many a stream, whose warbling waters pour To glad, and fertilise the subject plains; That hill with secret springs, and nooks untrod, And many a fancy-blest and holy sod Where Inspiration, his diviner strains Low-murmuring, lay; and starting from the rock's Stiff evergreens, (whose spreading foliage mocks Want's barren soil, and the bleak frosts of age, And Bigotry's mad fire-invoking rage!) O meek retiring spirit! we will climb, Cheering and cheered, this lovely hill sublime; And from the stirring world up-lifted high (Whose noises, faintly wafted on the wind, To quiet musings shall attune the mind, And oft the melancholy theme supply), There, while the prospect through the gazing eye Pours all its healthful greenness on the soul, We'll smile at wealth, and learn to smile at fame, Our hopes, our knowledge, and our joys the same, As neighbouring fountains image each the whole: Then when the mind hath drunk its fill of truth We'll discipline the heart to pure delight, Rekindling sober joy's domestic flame. They whom I love shall love thee, honour'd youth! Now may Heaven realise this vision bright! 1796. ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG MAN OF FORTUNE [C. Lloyd] WHO ABANDONED HIMSELF TO AN INDOLENT AND CAUSELESS MELANCHOLY Hence that fantastic wantonness of woe, O Youth to partial Fortune vainly dear! To plunder'd Want's half-shelter'd hovel go, Go, and some hunger-bitten infant hear Moan haply in a dying mother's ear: Or when the cold and dismal fog-damps brood O'er the rank church-yard with sear elm-leaves strew'd, Pace round some widow's grave, whose dearer part Was slaughter'd, where o'er his uncoffin'd limbs The flocking flesh-birds scream'd! Then, while thy heart Groans, and thine eye a fiercer sorrow dims, Know (and the truth shall kindle thy young mind) What Nature makes thee mourn, she bids thee heal! O abject! if, to sickly dreams resign'd, All effortless thou leave Life's commonweal A prey to Tyrants, Murderers of Mankind. 1796. TO A FRIEND [Charles Lamb] WHO HAD DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF WRITING NO MORE POETRY Dear Charles! whilst yet thou wert a babe, I ween That Genius plung'd thee in that wizard fount Hight Castalie: and (sureties of thy faith) That Pity and Simplicity stood by, And promis'd for thee, that thou shouldst renounce The world's low cares and lying vanities, Steadfast and rooted in the heavenly Muse, And wash'd and sanctified to Poesy. Yes—thou wert plung'd, but with forgetful hand Held, as by Thetis erst her warrior son: And with those recreant unbaptizéd heels Thou'rt flying from thy bounden ministeries— So sore it seems and burthensome a task To weave unwithering flowers! But take thou heed: For thou art vulnerable, wild-eyed boy, And I have arrows mystically dipped Such as may stop thy speed. Is thy Burns dead? And shall he die unwept, and sink to earth ‘Without the meed of one melodious tear’? Thy Burns, and Nature's own belovéd bard, Who to the ‘Illustrious of his native Land So properly did look for patronage.’ Ghost of Mæcenas! hide thy blushing face! They snatch'd him from the sickle and the plough— To gauge ale-firkins. Oh! for shame return! On a bleak rock, midway the Aonian mount, There stands a lone and melancholy tree, Whose agéd branches to the midnight blast Make solemn music: pluck its darkest bough, Ere yet the unwholesome night-dew be exhaled, And weeping wreath it round thy Poet's tomb. Then in the outskirts, where pollutions grow, Pick the rank henbane and the dusky flowers Of night-shade, or its red and tempting fruit, These with stopped nostril and glove-guarded hand Knit in nice intertexture, so to twine, The illustrious brow of Scotch Nobility! 1796. ODE TO THE DEPARTING YEAR ??? ???, ? ? ????. ??? ?? ?? ?????? ???????????? ????? ???????, ???????? ????????? ????????????. ?? ?????? ????. ??? ?? ?? ?? ????? ????? ???? ??????????? ????????? ?????. Aeschyl. Agam. 1173–75; 1199–1200. ARGUMENT The Ode commences with an address to the Divine Providence that regulates into one vast harmony all the events of time, however calamitous some of them may appear to mortals. The second Strophe calls on men to suspend their private joys and sorrows, and devote them for a while to the cause of human nature in general. The first Epode speaks of the Empress of Russia, who died of an apoplexy on the 17th of November 1796; having just concluded a subsidiary treaty with the Kings combined against France. The first and second Antistrophe describe the Image of the Departing Year, etc., as in a vision. The second Epode prophesies, in anguish of spirit, the downfall of this country. I Spirit who sweepest the wild Harp of Time! It is most hard, with an untroubled ear Thy dark inwoven harmonies to hear! Yet, mine eye fix'd on Heaven's unchanging clime Long had I listen'd, free from mortal fear, With inward stillness, and a bowéd mind; When lo! its folds far waving on the wind, I saw the train of the Departing Year! Starting from my silent sadness Then with no unholy madness, Ere yet the enter'd cloud foreclos'd my sight, I rais'd the impetuous song, and solemnis'd his flight. II Hither, from the recent tomb, From the prison's direr gloom, From Distemper's midnight anguish; And thence, where Poverty doth waste and languish; Or where, his two bright torches blending, Love illumines Manhood's maze; Or where o'er cradled infants bending, Hope has fix'd her wishful gaze; Hither, in perplexéd dance, Ye Woes! ye young-eyed Joys! advance! By Time's wild harp, and by the hand Whose indefatigable sweep Raises its fateful strings from sleep, I bid you haste, a mix'd tumultuous band! From every private bower, And each domestic hearth, Haste for one solemn hour; And with a loud and yet a louder voice, O'er Nature struggling in portentous birth, Weep and rejoice! Still echoes the dread Name that o'er the earth Let slip the storm, and woke the brood of Hell: And now advance in saintly Jubilee Justice and Truth! They too have heard thy spell, They too obey thy name, divinest Liberty! III I mark'd Ambition in his war-array! I heard the mailéd Monarch's troublous cry— ‘Ah! wherefore does the Northern Conqueress stay! Groans not her chariot on its onward way?’ Fly, mailéd Monarch, fly! Stunn'd by Death's twice mortal mace, No more on Murder's lurid face The insatiate Hag shall gloat with drunken eye! Manes of the unnumber'd slain! Ye that gasp'd on Warsaw's plain! Ye that erst at Ismail's tower, When human ruin choked the streams, Fell in Conquest's glutted hour, Mid women's shrieks and infants' screams! Spirits of the uncoffin'd slain, Sudden blasts of triumph swelling, Oft, at night, in misty train, Rush around her narrow dwelling! The exterminating Fiend is fled— (Foul her life, and dark her doom) Mighty armies of the dead Dance, like death-fires, round her tomb! Then with prophetic song relate, Each some Tyrant-Murderer's fate! IV Departing Year! 'twas on no earthly shore My soul beheld thy Vision! Where alone, Voiceless and stern, before the cloudy throne, Aye Memory sits: thy robe inscrib'd with gore, With many an unimaginable groan Thou storied'st thy sad hours! Silence ensued, Deep silence o'er the ethereal multitude, Whose locks with wreaths, whose wreaths with glories shone. Then, his eye wild ardours glancing, From the choiréd gods advancing, The Spirit of the Earth made reverence meet, And stood up, beautiful, before the cloudy seat. V Throughout the blissful throng, Hush'd were harp and song: Till wheeling round the throne the Lampads seven, (The mystic Words of Heaven) Permissive signal make: The fervent Spirit bow'd, then spread his wings and spake! ‘Thou in stormy blackness throning Love and uncreated Light, By the Earth's unsolaced groaning, Seize thy terrors, Arm of might! By Peace with proffer'd insult scared, Masked Hate and envying Scorn! By years of Havoc yet unborn! And Hunger's bosom to the frost-winds bared! But chief by Afric's wrongs, Strange, horrible, and foul! By what deep guilt belongs To the deaf Synod, ‘full of gifts and lies!’ By Wealth's insensate laugh! by Torture's howl! Avenger, rise! For ever shall the thankless Island scowl, Her quiver full, and with unbroken bow? Speak! from thy storm-black Heaven O speak aloud! And on the darkling foe Open thine eye of fire from some uncertain cloud! O dart the flash! O rise and deal the blow! The Past to thee, to thee the Future cries! Hark! how wide Nature joins her groans below! Rise, God of Nature! rise.’ VI The voice had ceas'd, the Vision fled; Yet still I gasp'd and reel'd with dread. And ever, when the dream of night Renews the phantom to my sight, Cold sweat-drops gather on my limbs; My ears throb hot; my eye-balls start; My brain with horrid tumult swims; Wild is the tempest of my heart; And my thick and struggling breath Imitates the toil of death! No stranger agony confounds The Soldier on the war-field spread, When all foredone with toil and wounds, Death-like he dozes among heaps of dead! (The strife is o'er, the day-light fled, And the night-wind clamours hoarse! See! the starting wretch's head Lies pillow'd on a brother's corse!) VII Not yet enslaved, not wholly vile, O Albion! O my mother Isle! Thy valleys, fair as Eden's bowers, Glitter green with sunny showers; Thy grassy uplands' gentle swells Echo to the bleat of flocks; (Those grassy hills, those glittering dells Proudly ramparted with rocks) And Ocean mid his uproar wild Speaks safety to his Island-child! Hence for many a fearless age Has social Quiet lov'd thy shore; Nor ever proud Invader's rage Or sack'd thy towers, or stain'd thy fields with gore. VIII Abandon'd of Heaven! mad Avarice thy guide, At cowardly distance, yet kindling with pride— Mid thy herds and thy corn-fields secure thou hast stood, And join'd the wild yelling of Famine and Blood! The nations curse thee! They with eager wondering Shall hear Destruction, like a vulture, scream! Strange-eyed Destruction! who with many a dream Of central fires through nether seas up-thundering Soothes her fierce solitude; yet as she lies By livid fount, or red volcanic stream, If ever to her lidless dragon-eyes, O Albion! thy predestin'd ruins rise, The fiend-hag on her perilous couch doth leap, Muttering distemper'd triumph in her charméd sleep. IX Away, my soul, away! In vain, in vain the Birds of warning sing— And hark! I hear the famish'd brood of prey Flap their lank pennons on the groaning wind! Away, my soul, away! I unpartaking of the evil thing, With daily prayer and daily toil Soliciting for food my scanty soil, Have wail'd my country with a loud Lament. Now I recentre my immortal mind In the deep Sabbath of meek self-content; Cleans'd from the vaporous passions that bedim God's Image, sister of the Seraphim. 1796. THE RAVEN A CHRISTMAS TALE, TOLD BY A SCHOOL-BOY TO HIS LITTLE BROTHERS AND SISTERS Underneath an old oak tree There was of swine a huge company, That grunted as they crunched the mast: For that was ripe, and fell full fast. Then they trotted away, for the wind grew high: One acorn they left, and no more might you spy. Next came a Raven, that liked not such folly: He belonged, they did say, to the witch Melancholy! Blacker was he than blackest jet, Flew low in the rain, and his feathers not wet. He picked up the acorn and buried it straight By the side of a river both deep and great. Where then did the Raven go? He went high and low, Over hill, over dale, did the black Raven go. Many Autumns, many Springs Travelled he with wandering wings: Many Summers, many Winters— I can't tell half his adventures. At length he came back, and with him a She, And the acorn was grown to a tall oak tree. They built them a nest in the topmost bough, And young ones they had, and were happy enow. But soon came a Woodman in leathern guise, His brow, like a pent-house, hung over his eyes. He'd an axe in his hand, not a word he spoke, But with many a hem! and a sturdy stroke, At length he brought down the poor Raven's own oak. His young ones were killed; for they could not depart, And their mother did die of a broken heart. The boughs from the trunk the Woodman did sever; And they floated it down on the course of the river. They sawed it in planks, and its bark they did strip, And with this tree and others they made a good ship. The ship, it was launched; but in sight of the land Such a storm there did rise as no ship could withstand. It bulged on a rock, and the waves rush'd in fast: Round and round flew the raven, and cawed to the blast. He heard the last shriek of the perishing souls— See! see! o'er the topmast the mad water rolls! Right glad was the Raven, and off he went fleet, And Death riding home on a cloud he did meet, And he thank'd him again and again for this treat: They had taken his all, and Revenge it was sweet! 1797. TO AN UNFORTUNATE WOMAN AT THE THEATRE Maiden, that with sullen brow Sitt'st behind those virgins gay, Like a scorch'd and mildew'd bough, Leafless 'mid the blooms of May! Him who lur'd thee and forsook, Oft I watch'd with angry gaze, Fearful saw his pleading look, Anxious heard his fervid phrase. Soft the glances of the Youth, Soft his speech, and soft his sigh; But no sound like simple Truth, But no true love in his eye. Loathing thy polluted lot, Hie thee, Maiden, hie thee hence! Seek thy weeping Mother's cot, With a wiser innocence. Thou hast known deceit and folly, Thou hast felt that Vice is woe: With a musing melancholy Inly arm'd, go, Maiden! go. Mother sage of Self-dominion, Firm thy steps, O Melancholy! The strongest plume in Wisdom's pinion Is the memory of past folly. Mute the sky-lark and forlorn, While she moults the firstling plumes, That had skimm'd the tender corn, Or the beanfield's odorous blooms. Soon with renovated wing Shall she dare a loftier flight, Upward to the Day-Star spring, And embathe in heavenly light. 1797. TO AN UNFORTUNATE WOMAN WHOM THE AUTHOR HAD KNOWN IN THE DAYS OF HER INNOCENCE Myrtle-leaf that, ill besped, Pinest in the gladsome ray, Soil'd beneath the common tread Far from thy protecting spray! When the Partridge o'er the sheaf Whirr'd along the yellow vale, Sad I saw thee, heedless leaf! Love the dalliance of the gale. Lightly didst thou, foolish thing! Heave and flutter to his sighs, While the flatterer, on his wing, Woo'd and whisper'd thee to rise. Gaily from thy mother-stalk Wert thou danc'd and wafted high— Soon on this unshelter'd walk Flung to fade, to rot and die. 1797. TO THE REV. GEORGE COLERIDGE OF OTTERY ST. MARY, DEVON With some Poems Notus in fratres animi paterni. Hor. Carm. lib. II. 2. A blesséd lot hath he, who having passed His youth and early manhood in the stir And turmoil of the world, retreats at length, With cares that move, not agitate the heart, To the same dwelling where his father dwelt; And haply views his tottering little ones Embrace those agéd knees and climb that lap, On which first kneeling his own infancy Lisp'd its brief prayer. Such, O my earliest Friend! Thy lot, and such thy brothers too enjoy. At distance did ye climb Life's upland road, Yet cheer'd and cheering: now fraternal love Hath drawn you to one centre. Be your days Holy, and blest and blessing may ye live! To me the Eternal Wisdom hath dispens'd A different fortune and more different mind— Me from the spot where first I sprang to light Too soon transplanted, ere my soul had fix'd Its first domestic loves; and hence through life Chasing chance-started friendships. A brief while Some have preserv'd me from life's pelting ills; But, like a tree with leaves of feeble stem, If the clouds lasted, and a sudden breeze Ruffled the boughs, they on my head at once Dropped the collected shower; and some most false, False and fair-foliag'd as the Manchineel, Have tempted me to slumber in their shade E'en mid the storm; then breathing subtlest damps, Mix'd their own venom with the rain from Heaven, That I woke poison'd! But, all praise to Him Who gives us all things, more have yielded me Permanent shelter; and beside one Friend, Beneath the impervious covert of one oak, I've rais'd a lowly shed, and know the names Of Husband and of Father; not unhearing Of that divine and nightly-whispering Voice, Which from my childhood to maturer years Spake to me of predestinated wreaths, Bright with no fading colours! Yet at times My soul is sad, that I have roam'd through life Still most a stranger, most with naked heart At mine own home and birth-place: chiefly then, When I remember thee, my earliest Friend! Thee, who didst watch my boyhood and my youth; Didst trace my wanderings with a father's eye; And boding evil yet still hoping good, Rebuk'd each fault, and over all my woes Sorrow'd in silence! He who counts alone The beatings of the solitary heart, That Being knows, how I have lov'd thee ever, Lov'd as a brother, as a son rever'd thee! Oh! 'tis to me an ever new delight, To talk of thee and thine: or when the blast Of the shrill winter, rattling our rude sash, Endears the cleanly hearth and social bowl; Or when, as now, on some delicious eve, We in our sweet sequester'd orchard-plot Sit on the tree crook'd earth-ward; whose old boughs, That hang above us in an arborous roof, Stirr'd by the faint gale of departing May, Send their loose blossoms slanting o'er our heads! Nor dost not thou sometimes recall those hours, When with the joy of hope thou gavest thine ear To my wild firstling-lays. Since then my song Hath sounded deeper notes, such as beseem Or that sad wisdom folly leaves behind, Or such as, tuned to these tumultuous times, Cope with the tempest's swell! These various strains, Which I have fram'd in many a various mood, Accept, my Brother! and (for some perchance Will strike discordant on thy milder mind) If aught of error or intemperate truth Should meet thine ear, think thou that riper Age Will calm it down, and let thy love forgive it! Nether-Stowey, Somerset, May 26, 1797. ON THE CHRISTENING OF A FRIEND'S CHILD This day among the faithful plac'd And fed with fontal manna, O with maternal title grac'd, Dear Anna's dearest Anna! While others wish thee wise and fair, A maid of spotless fame, I'll breathe this more compendious prayer— May'st thou deserve thy name! Thy mother's name, a potent spell, That bids the Virtues hie From mystic grove and living cell, Confess'd to Fancy's eye; Meek Quietness without offence; Content in homespun kirtle; True Love; and True Love's Innocence, White Blossom of the Myrtle! Associates of thy name, sweet Child! These Virtues may'st thou win; With face as eloquently mild To say, they lodge within. So, when her tale of days all flown, Thy mother shall be miss'd here; When Heaven at length shall claim its own And Angels snatch their Sister; Some hoary-headed friend, perchance, May gaze with stifled breath; And oft, in momentary trance, Forget the waste of death. Even thus a lovely rose I've view'd In summer-swelling pride; Nor mark'd the bud, that green and rude Peep'd at the rose's side. It chanc'd I pass'd again that way In Autumn's latest hour, And wond'ring saw the selfsame spray Rich with the selfsame flower. Ah fond deceit! the rude green bud Alike in shape, place, name, Had bloom'd where bloom'd its parent stud, Another and the same! 1797. TRANSLATION OF A LATIN INSCRIPTION BY THE REV. W. L. BOWLES IN NETHER-STOWEY CHURCH Depart in joy from this world's noise and strife To the deep quiet of celestial life!

THIS LIME-TREE BOWER MY PRISON [ADDRESSED TO CHARLES LAMB, OF THE INDIA HOUSE, LONDON] Well, they are gone, and here must I remain, This lime-tree bower my prison! I have lost Beauties and feelings, such as would have been Most sweet to my remembrance even when age Had dimm'd mine eyes to blindness! They, meanwhile, Friends, whom I never more may meet again, On springy heath, along the hill-top edge, Wander in gladness, and wind down, perchance, To that still roaring dell, of which I told; The roaring dell, o'erwooded, narrow, deep, And only speckled by the mid-day sun; Where its slim trunk the ash from rock to rock Flings arching like a bridge;—that branchless ash, Unsunn'd and damp, whose few poor yellow leaves Ne'er tremble in the gale, yet tremble still, Fann'd by the water-fall! and there my friends Behold the dark green file of long lank weeds, That all at once (a most fantastic sight!) Still nod and drip beneath the dripping edge Of the blue clay-stone. Now, my friends emerge Beneath the wide wide Heaven—and view again The many-steepled tract magnificent Of hilly fields and meadows, and the sea, With some fair bark, perhaps, whose sails light up The slip of smooth clear blue betwixt two Isles Of purple shadow! Yes! they wander on In gladness all; but thou, methinks, most glad, My gentle-hearted Charles! for thou hast pined And hunger'd after Nature, many a year, In the great City pent, winning thy way With sad yet patient soul, through evil and pain And strange calamity! Ah! slowly sink Behind the western ridge, thou glorious Sun! Shine in the slant beams of the sinking orb, Ye purple heath-flowers! richlier burn, ye clouds! Live in the yellow light, ye distant groves! And kindle, thou blue Ocean! So my friend Struck with deep joy may stand, as I have stood, Silent with swimming sense; yea, gazing round On the wide landscape, gaze till all doth seem Less gross than bodily; and of such hues As veil the Almighty Spirit, when yet he makes Spirits perceive his presence. A delight Comes sudden on my heart, and I am glad As I myself were there! Nor in this bower, This little lime-tree bower, have I not mark'd Much that has sooth'd me. Pale beneath the blaze Hung the transparent foliage; and I watch'd Some broad and sunny leaf, and lov'd to see The shadow of the leaf and stem above Dappling its sunshine! And that walnut-tree Was richly ting'd, and a deep radiance lay Full on the ancient ivy, which usurps Those fronting elms, and now, with blackest mass Makes their dark branches gleam a lighter hue Through the late twilight: and though now the bat Wheels silent by, and not a swallow twitters, Yet still the solitary humble-bee Sings in the bean-flower! Henceforth I shall know That Nature ne'er deserts the wise and pure; No plot so narrow, be but Nature there, No waste so vacant, but may well employ Each faculty of sense, and keep the heart Awake to Love and Beauty! and sometimes 'Tis well to be bereft of promis'd good, That we may lift the soul, and contemplate With lively joy the joys we cannot share. My gentle-hearted Charles! when the last rook Beat its straight path along the dusky air Homewards, I blest it! deeming its black wing (Now a dim speck, now vanishing in light) Had cross'd the mighty Orb's dilated glory, While thou stood'st gazing; or, when all was still, Flew creeking o'er thy head, and had a charm For thee, my gentle-hearted Charles, to whom No sound is dissonant which tells of Life. 1797.

'Tis strange! he spake of you familiarly As mine and Albert's common Foster-mother. Foster-Mother. Now blessings on the man, whoe'er he be, That joined your names with mine! O my sweet lady, As often as I think of those dear times When you two little ones would stand at eve On each side of my chair, and make me learn All you had learnt in the day; and how to talk In gentle phrase, then bid me sing to you— 'Tis more like heaven to come than what has been! Maria. O my dear Mother! this strange man has left me Troubled with wilder fancies, than the moon Breeds in the love-sick maid who gazes at it, Till lost in inward vision, with wet eye She gazes idly!—But that entrance, Mother! Foster-Mother. Can no one hear? It is a perilous tale! Maria. No one. Foster-Mother. My husband's father told it me, Poor old Leoni!—Angels rest his soul! He was a woodman, and could fell and saw With lusty arm. You know that huge round beam Which props the hanging wall of the old Chapel? Beneath that tree, while yet it was a tree, He found a baby wrapt in mosses, lined With thistle-beards, and such small locks of wool As hang on brambles. Well, he brought him home, And rear'd him at the then Lord Velez' cost. And so the babe grew up a pretty boy, A pretty boy, but most unteachable— And never learnt a prayer, nor told a bead, But knew the names of birds, and mock'd their notes, And whistled, as he were a bird himself: And all the autumn 'twas his only play To get the seeds of wild flowers, and to plant them With earth and water, on the stumps of trees. A Friar, who gather'd simples in the wood, A grey-haired man—he lov'd this little boy, The boy lov'd him—and, when the Friar taught him, He soon could write with the pen: and from that time, Lived chiefly at the Convent or the Castle. So he became a very learnéd youth. But Oh! poor wretch!—he read, and read, and read, Till his brain turn'd—and ere his twentieth year, He had unlawful thoughts of many things: And though he prayed, he never lov'd to pray With holy men, nor in a holy place— But yet his speech, it was so soft and sweet, The late Lord Velez ne'er was wearied with him. And once, as by the north side of the Chapel They stood together, chain'd in deep discourse, The earth heav'd under them with such a groan, That the wall totter'd, and had well-nigh fallen Right on their heads. My Lord was sorely frighten'd; A fever seiz'd him, and he made confession Of all the heretical and lawless talk Which brought this judgment: so the youth was seiz'd And cast into that hole. My husband's father Sobb'd like a child—it almost broke his heart: And once as he was working in the cellar, He heard a voice distinctly; 'twas the youth's, Who sung a doleful song about green fields, How sweet it were on lake or wild savannah, To hunt for food, and be a naked man, And wander up and down at liberty. He always doted on the youth, and now His love grew desperate; and defying death, He made that cunning entrance I describ'd: And the young man escap'd. Maria. 'Tis a sweet tale: Such as would lull a listening child to sleep, His rosy face besoil'd with unwiped tears.— And what became of him? Foster-Mother. He went on shipboard With those bold voyagers, who made discovery Of golden lands. Leoni's younger brother Went likewise, and when he return'd to Spain, He told Leoni, that the poor mad youth, Soon after they arriv'd in that new world, In spite of his dissuasion, seiz'd a boat, And all alone, set sail by silent moonlight Up a great river, great as any sea, And ne'er was heard of more: but 'tis suppos'd, He liv'd and died among the savage men. 1797. THE DUNGEON [From Osorio, Act V; and Remorse, Act V, Scene i. The title and text are here printed from Lyrical Ballads, 1798.] And this place our forefathers made for man! This is the process of our love and wisdom, To each poor brother who offends against us— Most innocent, perhaps—and what if guilty? Is this the only cure? Merciful God! Each pore and natural outlet shrivell'd up By Ignorance and parching Poverty, His energies roll back upon his heart, And stagnate and corrupt; till chang'd to poison, They break out on him, like a loathsome plague-spot; Then we call in our pamper'd mountebanks— And this is their best cure! uncomforted And friendless solitude, groaning and tears, And savage faces, at the clanking hour, Seen through the steams and vapour of his dungeon, By the lamp's dismal twilight! So he lies Circled with evil, till his very soul Unmoulds its essence, hopelessly deform'd By sights of ever more deformity! With other ministrations thou, O Nature! Healest thy wandering and distemper'd child: Thou pourest on him thy soft influences, Thy sunny hues, fair forms, and breathing sweets, Thy melodies of woods, and winds, and waters, Till he relent, and can no more endure To be a jarring and a dissonant thing, Amid this general dance and minstrelsy; But, bursting into tears, wins back his way, His angry spirit heal'd and harmoniz'd By the benignant touch of Love and Beauty. 1797. THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER IN SEVEN PARTS Facile credo, plures esse Naturas invisibiles quam visibiles in rerum universitate. Sed horum omnium familiam quis nobis enarrabit? et gradus et cognationes et discrimina et singulorum munera? Quid agunt? quae loca habitant? Harum rerum notitiam semper ambivit ingenium humanum, nunquam attigit. Juvat, interea, non diffiteor, quandoque in animo, tanquam in tabulâ, majoris et melioris mundi imaginem contemplari: ne mens assuefacta hodiernae vitae minutiis se contrahat nimis, et tota subsidat in pusillas cogitationes. Sed veritati interea invigilandum est, modusque servandus, ut certa ab incertis, diem a nocte, distinguamus. —T. Burnet, Archaeol. Phil. p. 68. ARGUMENT How a Ship having passed the Line was driven by storms to the cold Country towards the South Pole; and how from thence she made her course to the tropical Latitude of the Great Pacific Ocean; and of the strange things that befell; and in what manner the Ancyent Marinere came back to his own Country. [L. B. 1798.] Part I An ancient Mariner meeteth three Gallants bidden to a weddingfeast, and detaineth one. It is an ancient Mariner, And he stoppeth one of three. ‘By thy long grey beard and glittering eye, Now wherefore stopp'st thou me? The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide, And I am next of kin; The guests are met, the feast is set: May'st hear the merry din.’ He holds him with his skinny hand, ‘There was a ship,’ quoth he. ‘Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!’ Eftsoons his hand dropt he. The Wedding-Guest is spellbound by the eye of the old seafaring man, and constrained to hear his tale. He holds him with his glittering eye— The Wedding-Guest stood still, And listens like a three years' child: The Mariner hath his will. The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone: He cannot choose but hear; And thus spake on that ancient man, The bright-eyed Mariner. ‘The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared, Merrily did we drop Below the kirk, below the hill, The Mariner tells how the ship sailed southward with a good wind and fair weather, till it reached the line. Below the lighthouse top. The Sun came up upon the left, Out of the sea came he! And he shone bright, and on the right Went down into the sea. Higher and higher every day, Till over the mast at noon—’ The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast, For he heard the loud bassoon. The Wedding-Guest heareth the bridal music; but the Mariner continueth his tale. The bride hath paced into the hall, Red as a rose is she; Nodding their heads before her goes The merry minstrelsy. The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast, Yet he cannot choose but hear; And thus spake on that ancient man, The bright-eyed Mariner. The ship driven by a storm toward the south pole. ‘And now the Storm-blast came, and he Was tyrannous and strong: He struck with his o'ertaking wings, And chased us south along. With sloping masts and dipping prow, As who pursued with yell and blow Still treads the shadow of his foe, And forward bends his head, The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast, And southward aye we fled. And now there came both mist and snow, And it grew wondrous cold: And ice, mast-high, came floating by, As green as emerald. The land of ice, and of fearful sounds where no living thing was to be seen. And through the drifts the snowy clifts Did send a dismal sheen: Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken— The ice was all between. The ice was here, the ice was there, The ice was all around: It cracked and growled, and roared and howled, Like noises in a swound! Till a great sea-bird, called the Albatross, came through the snow-fog, and was received with great joy and hospitality. At length did cross an Albatross, Thorough the fog it came; As if it had been a Christian soul, We hailed it in God's name. It ate the food it ne'er had eat, And round and round it flew. The ice did split with a thunder-fit; The helmsman steered us through! And lo! the Albatross proveth a bird of good omen, and followeth the ship as it returned northward through fog and floating ice. And a good south wind sprung up behind; The Albatross did follow, And every day, for food or play, Came to the mariner's hollo! In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud, It perched for vespers nine; Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white, Glimmered the white Moon-shine.’ The ancient Mariner inhospitably killeth the pious bird of good omen. ‘God save thee, ancient Mariner! From the fiends, that plague thee thus!— Why look'st thou so?’—With my cross-bow I shot the Albatross. Part II The Sun now rose upon the right: Out of the sea came he, Still hid in mist, and on the left Went down into the sea. And the good south wind still blew behind, But no sweet bird did follow, Nor any day for food or play Came to the mariners' hollo! His shipmates cry out against the ancient Mariner, for killing the bird of good luck. And I had done a hellish thing, And it would work 'em woe: For all averred, I had killed the bird That made the breeze to blow. Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay, That made the breeze to blow! But when the fog cleared off, they justify the same, and thus make themselves accomplices in the crime. Nor dim nor red, like God's own head, The glorious Sun uprist: Then all averred, I had killed the bird That brought the fog and mist. 'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay, That bring the fog and mist. The fair breeze continues; the ship enters the Pacific Ocean, and sails northward, even till it reaches the Line. The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew, The furrow followed free; We were the first that ever burst Into that silent sea. Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down, The ship hath been suddenly becalmed. 'Twas sad as sad could be; And we did speak only to break The silence of the sea! All in a hot and copper sky, The bloody Sun, at noon, Right up above the mast did stand, No bigger than the Moon. Day after day, day after day, We stuck, nor breath nor motion; As idle as a painted ship Upon a painted ocean. And the Albatross begins to be avenged. Water, water, every where, And all the boards did shrink; Water, water, every where, Nor any drop to drink. The very deep did rot: O Christ! That ever this should be! Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs Upon the slimy sea. About, about, in reel and rout The death-fires danced at night; The water, like a witch's oils, Burnt green, and blue and white. A Spirit had followed them; one of the invisible inhabitants of this planet, neither departed souls nor angels; concerning whom the learned Jew, Josephus, and the Platonic Constantinopolitan, Michael Psellus, may be consulted. They are very numerous, and there is no climate or element without one or more. And some in dreams assuréd were Of the Spirit that plagued us so; Nine fathom deep he had followed us From the land of mist and snow. And every tongue, through utter drought, Was withered at the root; We could not speak, no more than if We had been choked with soot. The shipmates, in their sore distress, would fain throw the whole guilt on the ancient Mariner: in sign whereof they hang the dead sea-bird round his neck. Ah! well a-day! what evil looks Had I from old and young! Instead of the cross, the Albatross About my neck was hung. Part III There passed a weary time. Each throat Was parched, and glazed each eye. A weary time! a weary time! How glazed each weary eye, The ancient Mariner beholdeth a sign in the element afar off. When looking westward, I beheld A something in the sky. At first it seemed a little speck, And then it seemed a mist; It moved and moved, and took at last A certain shape, I wist. A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist! And still it neared and neared: As if it dodged a water-sprite, It plunged and tacked and veered. At its nearer approach, it seemeth him to be a ship; and at a dear ransom he freeth his speech from the bonds of thirst. With throats unslaked, with black lips baked, We could nor laugh nor wail; Through utter drought all dumb we stood! I bit my arm, I sucked the blood, And cried, A sail! a sail! With throats unslaked, with black lips baked, Agape they heard me call: A flash of joy; Gramercy! they for joy did grin, And all at once their breath drew in, As they were drinking all. And horror follows. For can it be a ship that comes onward without wind or tide? See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more! Hither to work us weal; Without a breeze, without a tide, She steadies with upright keel! The western wave was all a-flame. The day was well nigh done! Almost upon the western wave Rested the broad bright Sun; When that strange shape drove suddenly Betwixt us and the Sun. It seemeth him but the skeleton of a ship. And straight the Sun was flecked with bars, (Heaven's Mother send us grace!) As if through a dungeon-grate he peered With broad and burning face. Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud) How fast she nears and nears! And its ribs are seen as bars on the face of the setting Sun. Are those her sails that glance in the Sun, Like restless gossameres? The Spectre-Woman and her Deathmate, and no other on board the skeleton ship. Are those her ribs through which the Sun Did peer, as through a grate? And is that Woman all her crew? Is that a Death? and are there two? Is Death that woman's mate? Like vessel, like crew! Her lips were red, her looks were free, Her locks were yellow as gold: Death and Life-in-Death have diced for the ship's crew, and she (the latter) winneth the ancient Mariner. Her skin was as white as leprosy, The Night-mare Life-in-Death was she, Who thicks man's blood with cold. The naked hulk alongside came, And the twain were casting dice; ‘The game is done! I've won! I've won!’ Quoth she, and whistles thrice. No twilight within the courts of the Sun. The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out: At one stride comes the dark; With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea, Off shot the spectre-bark. At the rising of the Moon, We listened and looked sideways up! Fear at my heart, as at a cup, My life-blood seemed to sip! The stars were dim, and thick the night, The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white; From the sails the dew did drip— Till clomb above the eastern bar The hornéd Moon, with one bright star Within the nether tip. One after another, One after one, by the star-dogged Moon, Too quick for groan or sigh, Each turned his face with a ghastly pang, And cursed me with his eye. His shipmates drop down dead. Four times fifty living men, (And I heard nor sigh nor groan) With heavy thump, a lifeless lump, They dropped down one by one. But Life-in-Death begins her work on the ancient Mariner. The souls did from their bodies fly,— They fled to bliss or woe! And every soul, it passed me by, Like the whizz of my cross-bow! Part IV The Wedding-Guest feareth that a Spirit is talking to him; ‘I fear thee, ancient Mariner! I fear thy skinny hand! And thou art long, and lank, and brown, As is the ribbed sea-sand. I fear thee and thy glittering eye, And thy skinny hand, so brown.’— But the ancient Mariner assureth him of his bodily life, and proceedeth to relate his horrible penance. Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest! This body dropt not down. Alone, alone, all, all alone, Alone on a wide wide sea! And never a saint took pity on My soul in agony. He despiseth the creatures of the calm, The many men, so beautiful! And they all dead did lie: And a thousand thousand slimy things Lived on; and so did I. And envieth that they should live, and so many lie dead. I looked upon the rotting sea, And drew my eyes away; I looked upon the rotting deck, And there the dead men lay. I looked to heaven, and tried to pray; But or ever a prayer had gusht, A wicked whisper came, and made My heart as dry as dust. I closed my lids, and kept them close, And the balls like pulses beat; For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky Lay like a load on my weary eye, And the dead were at my feet. But the curse liveth for him in the eye of the dead men. The cold sweat melted from their limbs, Nor rot nor reek did they: The look with which they looked on me Had never passed away. An orphan's curse would drag to hell A spirit from on high; But oh! more horrible than that Is the curse in a dead man's eye! Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse, And yet I could not die. In his lone-liness and fixedness he yearneth towards the journeying Moon, and the stars that still sojourn, yet still move onward; and every where the blue sky belongs to them, and is their appointed rest, and their native country and their own natural homes, which they enter unannounced, as lords that are certainly expected and yet there is a silent joy at their arrival. The moving Moon went up the sky. And no where did abide: Softly she was going up, And a star or two beside— Her beams bemocked the sultry main, Like April hoar-frost spread; But where the ship's huge shadow lay, The charméd water burnt alway A still and awful red. By the light of the Moon he beholdeth God's creatures of the great calm. Beyond the shadow of the ship, I watched the water-snakes: They moved in tracks of shining white, And when they reared, the elfish light Fell off in hoary flakes. Within the shadow of the ship I watched their rich attire: Blue, glossy green, and velvet black, They coiled and swam; and every track Was a flash of golden fire. Their beauty and their happiness. O happy living things! no tongue Their beauty might declare: A spring of love gushed from my heart, He blesseth them in his heart. And I blessed them unaware: Sure my kind saint took pity on me, And I blessed them unaware. The spell begins to break. The self-same moment I could pray; And from my neck so free The Albatross fell off, and sank Like lead into the sea. Part V Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing, Beloved from pole to pole! To Mary Queen the praise be given! She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven, That slid into my soul. By grace of the holy Mother, the ancient Mariner is refreshed with rain. The silly buckets on the deck, That had so long remained, I dreamt that they were filled with dew; And when I awoke, it rained. My lips were wet, my throat was cold, My garments all were dank; Sure I had drunken in my dreams, And still my body drank. I moved, and could not feel my limbs: I was so light—almost I thought that I had died in sleep, And was a blesséd ghost. He heareth sounds and seeth strange sights and commotions in the sky and the element. And soon I heard a roaring wind: It did not come anear; But with its sound it shook the sails, That were so thin and sere. The upper air burst into life! And a hundred fire-flags sheen, To and fro they were hurried about! And to and fro, and in and out, The wan stars danced between. And the coming wind did roar more loud, And the sails did sigh like sedge; And the rain poured down from one black cloud; The Moon was at its edge. The thick black cloud was cleft, and still The Moon was at its side: Like waters shot from some high crag, The lightning fell with never a jag, A river steep and wide. The bodies of the ship's crew are inspired [inspirited, S. L.] and the ship moves on; The loud wind never reached the ship, Yet now the ship moved on! Beneath the lightning and the Moon The dead men gave a groan. They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose, Nor spake, nor moved their eyes; It had been strange, even in a dream, To have seen those dead men rise. The helmsman steered, the ship moved on; Yet never a breeze up-blew; The mariners all 'gan work the ropes, Where they were wont to do; They raised their limbs like lifeless tools— We were a ghastly crew. The body of my brother's son Stood by me, knee to knee: The body and I pulled at one rope, But he said nought to me. ‘I fear thee, ancient Mariner!’ But not by the souls of the men, nor by dæmons of earth or middle air, but by a blessed troop of angelic spirits, sent down by the invocation of the guardian saint. Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest! 'Twas not those souls that fled in pain, Which to their corses came again, But a troop of spirits blest: For when it dawned—they dropped their arms, And clustered round the mast; Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths, And from their bodies passed. Around, around, flew each sweet sound, Then darted to the Sun; Slowly the sounds came back again, Now mixed, now one by one. Sometimes a-dropping from the sky I heard the sky-lark sing; Sometimes all little birds that are, How they seemed to fill the sea and air With their sweet jargoning! And now 'twas like all instruments, Now like a lonely flute; And now it is an angel's song, That makes the heavens be mute. It ceased; yet still the sails made on A pleasant noise till noon, A noise like of a hidden brook In the leafy month of June, That to the sleeping woods all night Singeth a quiet tune. Till noon we quietly sailed on, Yet never a breeze did breathe: Slowly and smoothly went the ship, Moved onward from beneath. The lonesome Spirit from the south-pole carries on the ship as far as the Line, in obedience to the angelic troop, but still requireth vengeance. Under the keel nine fathom deep, From the land of mist and snow, The spirit slid: and it was he That made the ship to go. The sails at noon left off their tune, And the ship stood still also. The Sun, right up above the mast, Had fixed her to the ocean: But in a minute she 'gan stir, With a short uneasy motion— Backwards and forwards half her length With a short uneasy motion. Then like a pawing horse let go, She made a sudden bound: It flung the blood into my head, And I fell down in a swound. The Polar Spirit's fellow-dæmons, the invisible inhabitants of the element, take part in his wrong; and two of them relate, one to the other, that penance long and heavy for the ancient Mariner hath been accorded to the Polar Spirit, who returneth southward. How long in that same fit I lay, I have not to declare; But ere my living life returned, I heard and in my soul discerned Two voices in the air. ‘Is it he?’ quoth one, ‘Is this the man? By him who died on cross, With his cruel bow he laid full low The harmless Albatross. The spirit who bideth by himself In the land of mist and snow, He loved the bird that loved the man Who shot him with his bow.’ The other was a softer voice, As soft as honey-dew: Quoth he, ‘The man hath penance done, And penance more will do.’ Part VI FIRST VOICE ‘But tell me, tell me! speak again, Thy soft response renewing— What makes that ship drive on so fast? What is the ocean doing?’ SECOND VOICE ‘Still as a slave before his lord, The ocean hath no blast; His great bright eye most silently Up to the Moon is cast— If he may know which way to go; For she guides him smooth or grim. See, brother, see! how graciously She looketh down on him.’ FIRST VOICE The Mariner hath been cast into a trance; for the angelic power causeth the vessel to drive northward faster than human life could endure. ‘But why drives on that ship so fast, Without or wave or wind?’ SECOND VOICE ‘The air is cut away before, And closes from behind. Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high! Or we shall be belated: For slow and slow that ship will go, When the Mariner's trance is abated.’ The supernatural motion is retarded; the Mariner awakes, and his penance begins anew. I woke, and we were sailing on As in a gentle weather: 'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high; The dead men stood together. All stood together on the deck, For a charnel-dungeon fitter: All fixed on me their stony eyes, That in the Moon did glitter. The pang, the curse, with which they died, Had never passed away: I could not draw my eyes from theirs, Nor turn them up to pray. The curse is finally expiated. And now this spell was snapt: once more I viewed the ocean green, And looked far forth, yet little saw Of what had else been seen— Like one, that on a lonesome road Doth walk in fear and dread, And having once turned round walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows, a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread. But soon there breathed a wind on me, Nor sound nor motion made: Its path was not upon the sea, In ripple or in shade. It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek Like a meadow-gale of spring— It mingled strangely with my fears, Yet it felt like a welcoming. Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship, Yet she sailed softly too: Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze— On me alone it blew. And the ancient Mariner beholdeth his native country. Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed The light-house top I see? Is this the hill? is this the kirk? Is this mine own countree? We drifted o'er the harbour-bar, And I with sobs did pray— O let me be awake, my God! Or let me sleep alway. The harbour-bay was clear as glass, So smoothly it was strewn! And on the bay the moonlight lay, And the shadow of the Moon. The rock shone bright, the kirk no less, That stands above the rock: The moonlight steeped in silentness The steady weathercock. And the bay was white with silent light, Till rising from the same, The angelic spirits leave the dead bodies, Full many shapes, that shadows were, In crimson colours came. And appear in their own forms of light. A little distance from the prow Those crimson shadows were: I turned my eyes upon the deck— Oh, Christ! what saw I there! Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat, And, by the holy rood! A man all light, a seraph-man, On every corse there stood. This seraph-band, each waved his hand: It was a heavenly sight! They stood as signals to the land, Each one a lovely light; This seraph-band, each waved his hand, No voice did they impart— No voice; but oh! the silence sank Like music on my heart. But soon I heard the dash of oars, I heard the Pilot's cheer; My head was turned perforce away, And I saw a boat appear. The Pilot and the Pilot's boy, I heard them coming fast: Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy The dead men could not blast. I saw a third—I heard his voice: It is the Hermit good! He singeth loud his godly hymns That he makes in the wood. He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away The Albatross's blood. Part VII The Hermit of the Wood, This Hermit good lives in that wood Which slopes down to the sea. How loudly his sweet voice he rears! He loves to talk with marineres That come from a far countree. He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve— He hath a cushion plump: It is the moss that wholly hides The rotted old oak-stump. The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk, ‘Why, this is strange, I trow! Where are those lights so many and fair, That signal made but now?’ Approacheth the ship with wonder. ‘Strange, by my faith!’ the Hermit said— ‘And they answered not our cheer! The planks looked warped! and see those sails, How thin they are and sere! I never saw aught like to them, Unless perchance it were Brown skeletons of leaves that lag My forest-brook along; When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow, And the owlet whoops to the wolf below, That eats the she-wolf's young.’ ‘Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look— (The Pilot made reply) I am a-feared’—‘Push on, push on!’ Said the Hermit cheerily. The boat came closer to the ship, But I nor spake nor stirred; The boat came close beneath the ship, And straight a sound was heard. The ship suddenly sinketh. Under the water it rumbled on, Still louder and more dread: It reached the ship, it split the bay; The ship went down like lead. The ancient Mariner is saved in the Pilot's boat. Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound, Which sky and ocean smote, Like one that hath been seven days drowned My body lay afloat; But swift as dreams, myself I found Within the Pilot's boat. Upon the whirl, where sank the ship, The boat spun round and round; And all was still, save that the hill Was telling of the sound. I moved my lips—the Pilot shrieked And fell down in a fit; The holy Hermit raised his eyes, And prayed where he did sit. I took the oars: the Pilot's boy, Who now doth crazy go, Laughed loud and long, and all the while His eyes went to and fro. ‘Ha! ha!’ quoth he, ‘full plain I see, The Devil knows how to row.’ And now, all in my own countree, I stood on the firm land! The Hermit stepped forth from the boat, And scarcely he could stand. The ancient Mariner earnestly entreateth the Hermit to shrieve him; and the penance of life falls on him. ‘O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!’ The Hermit crossed his brow. ‘Say quick,’ quoth he, ‘I bid thee say— What manner of man art thou?’ Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched With a woful agony, Which forced me to begin my tale; And then it left me free. And ever and anon throughout his future life an agony constraineth him to travel from land to land; Since then, at an uncertain hour, That agony returns: And till my ghastly tale is told, This heart within me burns. I pass, like night, from land to land; I have strange power of speech; That moment that his face I see, I know the man that must hear me: To him my tale I teach. What loud uproar bursts from that door! The wedding-guests are there: But in the garden-bower the bride And bride-maids singing are: And hark the little vesper bell, Which biddeth me to prayer! O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been Alone on a wide wide sea: So lonely 'twas, that God himself Scarce seeméd there to be. O sweeter than the marriage-feast, 'Tis sweeter far to me, To walk together to the kirk With a goodly company!— To walk together to the kirk, And all together pray, While each to his great Father bends, Old men, and babes, and loving friends And youths and maidens gay! And to teach, by his own example, love and reverence to all things that God made and loveth. Farewell, farewell! but this I tell To thee, thou Wedding-Guest! He prayeth well, who loveth well Both man and bird and beast. He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small; For the dear God who loveth us, He made and loveth all. The Mariner, whose eye is bright, Whose beard with age is hoar, Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest Turned from the bridegroom's door. He went like one that hath been stunned, And is of sense forlorn: A sadder and a wiser man, He rose the morrow morn. 1797–1798. SONNETS ATTEMPTED IN THE MANNER OF CONTEMPORARY WRITERS [SIGNED ‘NEHEMIAH HIGGINBOTTOM’] I [Pensive at eve on the hard world I mus'd] Pensive at eve on the hard world I mus'd, And my poor heart was sad: so at the Moon I gaz'd—and sigh'd, and sigh'd!—for, ah! how soon Eve darkens into night. Mine eye perus'd With tearful vacancy the dampy grass Which wept and glitter'd in the paly ray; And I did pause me on my lonely way, And mused me on those wretched ones who pass O'er the black heath of Sorrow. But, alas! Most of Myself I thought: when it befell That the sooth Spirit of the breezy wood Breath'd in mine ear—‘All this is very well; But much of one thing is for no thing good.’ Ah! my poor heart's inexplicable swell! II TO SIMPLICITY O! I do love thee, meek Simplicity! For of thy lays the lulling simpleness Goes to my heart and soothes each small distress, Distress though small, yet haply great to me! 'Tis true on Lady Fortune's gentlest pad I amble on; yet, though I know not why, So sad I am!—but should a friend and I Grow cool and miff, O! I am very sad! And then with sonnets and with sympathy My dreamy bosom's mystic woes I pall; Now of my false friend plaining plaintively, Now raving at mankind in general; But, whether sad or fierce, 'tis simple all, All very simple, meek Simplicity! III ON A RUINED HOUSE IN A ROMANTIC COUNTRY And this reft house is that the which he built, Lamented Jack! And here his malt he pil'd, Cautious in vain! These rats that squeak so wild, Squeak, not unconscious of their father's guilt. Did ye not see her gleaming thro' the glade? Belike, 'twas she, the maiden all forlorn. What though she milk no cow with crumpled horn, Yet aye she haunts the dale where erst she stray'd; And aye beside her stalks her amorous knight! Still on his thighs their wonted brogues are worn, And thro' those brogues, still tatter'd and betorn, His hindward charms gleam an unearthly white; As when thro' broken clouds at night's high noon Peeps in fair fragments forth the full-orb'd harvest-moon! 1797. PARLIAMENTARY OSCILLATORS Almost awake? Why, what is this, and whence, O ye right loyal men, all undefiléd? Sure, 'tis not possible that Common-Sense Has hitch'd her pullies to each heavy eye-lid? Yet wherefore else that start, which discomposes The drowsy waters lingering in your eye? And are you really able to descry That precipice three yards beyond your noses? Yet flatter you I cannot, that your wit Is much improved by this long loyal dozing; And I admire, no more than Mr. Pitt, Your jumps and starts of patriotic prosing— Now cluttering to the Treasury Cluck, like chicken, Now with small beaks the ravenous Bill opposing; With serpent-tongue now stinging, and now licking, Now semi-sibilant, now smoothly glozing— Now having faith implicit that he can't err, Hoping his hopes, alarm'd with his alarms; And now believing him a sly inchanter, Yet still afraid to break his brittle charms, Lest some mad Devil suddenly unhamp'ring, Slap-dash! the imp should fly off with the steeple, On revolutionary broom-stick scampering.— O ye soft-headed and soft-hearted people, If you can stay so long from slumber free, My muse shall make an effort to salute 'e: For lo! a very dainty simile Flash'd sudden through my brain, and 'twill just suit 'e! You know that water-fowl that cries, Quack! Quack!? Full often have I seen a waggish crew Fasten the Bird of Wisdom on its back, The ivy-haunting bird, that cries, Tu-whoo! Both plung'd together in the deep mill-stream, (Mill-stream, or farm-yard pond, or mountain-lake,) Shrill, as a Church and Constitution scream, Tu-whoo! quoth Broad-face, and down dives the Drake! The green-neck'd Drake once more pops up to view, Stares round, cries Quack! and makes an angry pother; Then shriller screams the Bird with eye-lids blue, The broad-faced Bird! and deeper dives the other. Ye quacking Statesmen! 'tis even so with you— One Peasecod is not liker to another. Even so on Loyalty's Decoy-pond, each Pops up his head, as fir'd with British blood, Hears once again the Ministerial screech, And once more seeks the bottom's blackest mud! 1798. (Signed: Laberius.) CHRISTABEL PREFACE The first part of the following poem was written in the year 1797, at Stowey, in the county of Somerset. The second part, after my return from Germany, in the year 1800, at Keswick, Cumberland. It is probable that if the poem had been finished at either of the former periods, or if even the first and second part had been published in the year 1800, the impression of its originality would have been much greater than I dare at present expect. But for this I have only my own indolence to blame. The dates are mentioned for the exclusive purpose of precluding charges of plagiarism or servile imitation from myself. For there is amongst us a set of critics, who seem to hold, that every possible thought and image is traditional; who have no notion that there are such things as fountains in the world, small as well as great; and who would therefore charitably derive every rill they behold flowing, from a perforation made in some other man's tank. I am confident, however, that as far as the present poem is concerned, the celebrated poets whose writings I might be suspected of having imitated, either in particular passages, or in the tone and the spirit of the whole, would be among the first to vindicate me from the charge, and who, on any striking coincidence, would permit me to address them in this doggerel version of two monkish Latin hexameters. 'Tis mine and it is likewise yours; But an if this will not do; Let it be mine, good friend! for I Am the poorer of the two. I have only to add that the metre of Christabel is not, properly speaking, irregular, though it may seem so from its being founded on a new principle: namely, that of counting in each line the accents, not the syllables. Though the latter may vary from seven to twelve, yet in each line the accents will be found to be only four. Nevertheless, this occasional variation in number of syllables is not introduced wantonly, for for the mere ends of convenience, but in correspondence with some transition in the nature of the imagery or passion. Part I 'Tis the middle of night by the castle clock, And the owls have awakened the crowing cock; Tu—whit!—Tu—whoo! And hark, again! the crowing cock, How drowsily it crew. Sir Leoline, the Baron rich, Hath a toothless mastiff bitch; From her kennel beneath the rock She maketh answer to the clock, Four for the quarters, and twelve for the hour; Ever and aye, by shine and shower, Sixteen short howls, not over loud; Some say, she sees my lady's shroud. Is the night chilly and dark? The night is chilly, but not dark. The thin gray cloud is spread on high, It covers but not hides the sky. The moon is behind, and at the full; And yet she looks both small and dull. The night is chill, the cloud is gray: 'Tis a month before the month of May, And the Spring comes slowly up this way. The lovely lady, Christabel, Whom her father loves so well, What makes her in the wood so late, A furlong from the castle gate? She had dreams all yesternight Of her own betrothéd knight; And she in the midnight wood will pray For the weal of her lover that's far away. She stole along, she nothing spoke, The sighs she heaved were soft and low, And naught was green upon the oak But moss and rarest misletoe: She kneels beneath the huge oak tree, And in silence prayeth she. The lady sprang up suddenly, The lovely lady, Christabel! It moaned as near, as near can be, But what it is she cannot tell.— On the other side it seems to be, Of the huge, broad-breasted, old oak tree. The night is chill; the forest bare; Is it the wind that moaneth bleak? There is not wind enough in the air To move away the ringlet curl From the lovely lady's cheek— There is not wind enough to twirl The one red leaf, the last of its clan, That dances as often as dance it can, Hanging so light, and hanging so high, On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky. Hush, beating heart of Christabel! Jesu, Maria, shield her well! She folded her arms beneath her cloak, And stole to the other side of the oak. What sees she there? There she sees a damsel bright, Drest in a silken robe of white, That shadowy in the moonlight shone: The neck that made that white robe wan, Her stately neck, and arms were bare; Her blue-veined feet unsandal'd were, And wildly glittered here and there The gems entangled in her hair. I guess, 'twas frightful there to see A lady so richly clad as she— Beautiful exceedingly! Mary mother, save me now! (Said Christabel,) And who art thou? The lady strange made answer meet, And her voice was faint and sweet:— Have pity on my sore distress, I scarce can speak for weariness: Stretch forth thy hand, and have no fear! Said Christabel, How camest thou here? And the lady, whose voice was faint and sweet, Did thus pursue her answer meet:— My sire is of a noble line, And my name is Geraldine: Five warriors seized me yestermorn, Me, even me, a maid forlorn: They choked my cries with force and fright, And tied me on a palfrey white. The palfrey was as fleet as wind, And they rode furiously behind. They spurred amain, their steeds were white: And once we crossed the shade of night. As sure as Heaven shall rescue me, I have no thought what men they be; Nor do I know how long it is (For I have lain entranced I wis) Since one, the tallest of the five, Took me from the palfrey's back, A weary woman, scarce alive. Some muttered words his comrades spoke: He placed me underneath this oak; He swore they would return with haste; Whither they went I cannot tell— I thought I heard, some minutes past, Sounds as of a castle bell. Stretch forth thy hand (thus ended she), And help a wretched maid to flee. Then Christabel stretched forth her hand, And comforted fair Geraldine: O well, bright dame! may you command The service of Sir Leoline; And gladly our stout chivalry Will he send forth and friends withal To guide and guard you safe and free Home to your noble father's hall. She rose: and forth with steps they passed That strove to be, and were not, fast. Her gracious stars the lady blest, And thus spake on sweet Christabel: All our household are at rest, The hall as silent as the cell; Sir Leoline is weak in health, And may not well awakened be, But we will move as if in stealth, And I beseech your courtesy, This night, to share your couch with me. They crossed the moat, and Christabel Took the key that fitted well; A little door she opened straight, All in the middle of the gate; The gate that was ironed within and without, Where an army in battle array had marched out. The lady sank, belike through pain, And Christabel with might and main Lifted her up, a weary weight, Over the threshold of the gate: Then the lady rose again, And moved, as she were not in pain. So free from danger, free from fear, They crossed the court: right glad they were. And Christabel devoutly cried To the lady by her side, Praise we the Virgin all divine Who hath rescued thee from thy distress! Alas, alas! said Geraldine, I cannot speak for weariness. So free from danger, free from fear, They crossed the court: right glad they were. Outside her kennel, the mastiff old Lay fast asleep, in moonshine cold. The mastiff old did not awake, Yet she an angry moan did make! And what can ail the mastiff bitch? Never till now she uttered yell Beneath the eye of Christabel. Perhaps it is the owlet's scritch: For what can ail the mastiff bitch? They passed the hall, that echoes still, Pass as lightly as you will! The brands were flat, the brands were dying, Amid their own white ashes lying; But when the lady passed, there came A tongue of light, a fit of flame; And Christabel saw the lady's eye, And nothing else saw she thereby, Save the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline tall, Which hung in a murky old niche in the wall. O softly tread, said Christabel, My father seldom sleepeth well. Sweet Christabel her feet doth bare, And jealous of the listening air They steal their way from stair to stair, Now in glimmer, and now in gloom, And now they pass the Baron's room, As still as death, with stifled breath! And now have reached her chamber door; And now doth Geraldine press down The rushes of the chamber floor. The moon shines dim in the open air, And not a moonbeam enters here. But they without its light can see The chamber carved so curiously, Carved with figures strange and sweet, All made out of the carver's brain, For a lady's chamber meet: The lamp with twofold silver chain Is fastened to an angel's feet. The silver lamp burns dead and dim; But Christabel the lamp will trim. She trimmed the lamp, and made it bright, And left it swinging to and fro, While Geraldine, in wretched plight, Sank down upon the floor below. O weary lady, Geraldine, I pray you, drink this cordial wine! It is a wine of virtuous powers; My mother made it of wild flowers. And will your mother pity me, Who am a maiden most forlorn? Christabel answered—Woe is me! She died the hour that I was born. I have heard the grey-haired friar tell How on her death-bed she did say, That she should hear the castle-bell Strike twelve upon my wedding-day. O mother dear! that thou wert here! I would, said Geraldine, she were! But soon with altered voice, said she— ‘Off, wandering mother! Peak and pine! I have power to bid thee flee.’ Alas! what ails poor Geraldine? Why stares she with unsettled eye? Can she the bodiless dead espy? And why with hollow voice cries she, ‘Off, woman, off! this hour is mine— Though thou her guardian spirit be, Off, woman, off! 'tis given to me.’ Then Christabel knelt by the lady's side, And raised to heaven her eyes so blue— Alas! said she, this ghastly ride— Dear lady! it hath wildered you! The lady wiped her moist cold brow, And faintly said, ‘'tis over now!’ Again the wild-flower wine she drank: Her fair large eyes 'gan glitter bright, And from the floor whereon she sank, The lofty lady stood upright: She was most beautiful to see, Like a lady of a far countrée. And thus the lofty lady spake— ‘All they who live in the upper sky, Do love you, holy Christabel! And you love them, and for their sake And for the good which me befel, Even I in my degree will try, Fair maiden, to requite you well. But now unrobe yourself; for I Must pray, ere yet in bed I lie.’ Quoth Christabel, So let it be! And as the lady bade, did she. Her gentle limbs did she undress, And lay down in her loveliness. But through her brain of weal and woe So many thoughts moved to and fro, That vain it were her lids to close; So half-way from the bed she rose, And on her elbow did recline To look at the lady Geraldine. Beneath the lamp the lady bowed, And slowly rolled her eyes around; Then drawing in her breath aloud, Like one that shuddered, she unbound The cincture from beneath her breast: Her silken robe, and inner vest, Dropt to her feet, and full in view, Behold! her bosom and half her side— A sight to dream of, not to tell! O shield her! shield sweet Christabel! Yet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs; Ah! what a stricken look was hers! Deep from within she seems half-way To lift some weight with sick assay, And eyes the maid and seeks delay; Then suddenly, as one defied, Collects herself in scorn and pride, And lay down by the Maiden's side!— And in her arms the maid she took, Ah wel-a-day! And with low voice and doleful look These words did say: ‘In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell, Which is lord of thy utterance, Christabel! Thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow, This mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow; But vainly thou warrest, For this is alone in Thy power to declare, That in the dim forest Thou heard'st a low moaning, And found'st a bright lady, surpassingly fair; And didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity, To shield her and shelter her from the damp air.’ The Conclusion to Part I It was a lovely sight to see The lady Christabel, when she Was praying at the old oak tree. Amid the jaggéd shadows Of mossy leafless boughs, Kneeling in the moonlight, To make her gentle vows; Her slender palms together prest, Heaving sometimes on her breast; Her face resigned to bliss or bale— Her face, oh call it fair not pale, And both blue eyes more bright than clear, Each about to have a tear. With open eyes (ah woe is me!) Asleep, and dreaming fearfully, Fearfully dreaming, yet, I wis, Dreaming that alone, which is— O sorrow and shame! Can this be she, The lady, who knelt at the old oak tree? And lo! the worker of these harms, That holds the maiden in her arms, Seems to slumber still and mild, As a mother with her child. A star hath set, a star hath risen, O Geraldine! since arms of thine Have been the lovely lady's prison. O Geraldine! one hour was thine— Thou'st had thy will! By tairn and rill, The night-birds all that hour were still. But now they are jubilant anew, From cliff and tower, tu—whoo! tu—whoo! Tu—whoo! tu—whoo! from wood and fell! And see! the lady Christabel Gathers herself from out her trance; Her limbs relax, her countenance Grows sad and soft; the smooth thin lids Close o'er her eyes; and tears she sheds— Large tears that leave the lashes bright! And oft the while she seems to smile As infants at a sudden light! Yea, she doth smile, and she doth weep, Like a youthful hermitess, Beauteous in a wilderness, Who, praying always, prays in sleep. And, if she move unquietly, Perchance, 'tis but the blood so free Comes back and tingles in her feet. No doubt, she hath a vision sweet. What if her guardian spirit 'twere, What if she knew her mother near? But this she knows, in joys and woes, That saints will aid if men will call: For the blue sky bends over all! 1797. Part II Each matin bell, the Baron saith, Knells us back to a world of death. These words Sir Leoline first said, When he rose and found his lady dead: These words Sir Leoline will say Many a morn to his dying day! And hence the custom and law began That still at dawn the sacristan, Who duly pulls the heavy bell, Five and forty beads must tell Between each stroke—a warning knell, Which not a soul can choose but hear From Bratha Head to Wyndermere. Saith Bracy the bard, So let it knell! And let the drowsy sacristan Still count as slowly as he can! There is no lack of such, I ween, As well fill up the space between. In Langdale Pike and Witch's Lair, And Dungeon-ghyll so foully rent, With ropes of rock and bells of air Three sinful sextons' ghosts are pent, Who all give back, one after t'other, The death-note to their living brother; And oft too, by the knell offended, Just as their one! two! three! is ended, The devil mocks the doleful tale With a merry peal from Borodale. The air is still! through mist and cloud That merry peal comes ringing loud; And Geraldine shakes off her dread, And rises lightly from the bed; Puts on her silken vestments white, And tricks her hair in lovely plight, And nothing doubting of her spell Awakens the lady Christabel. ‘Sleep you, sweet lady Christabel? I trust that you have rested well.’ And Christabel awoke and spied The same who lay down by her side— O rather say, the same whom she Raised up beneath the old oak tree! Nay, fairer yet! and yet more fair! For she belike hath drunken deep Of all the blessedness of sleep! And while she spake, her looks, her air Such gentle thankfulness declare, That (so it seemed) her girded vests Grew tight beneath her heaving breasts. ‘Sure I have sinn'd!’ said Christabel, ‘Now heaven be praised if all be well!’ And in low faltering tones, yet sweet, Did she the lofty lady greet With such perplexity of mind As dreams too lively leave behind. So quickly she rose, and quickly arrayed Her maiden limbs, and having prayed That He, who on the cross did groan, Might wash away her sins unknown, She forthwith led fair Geraldine To meet her sire, Sir Leoline. The lovely maid and the lady tall Are pacing both into the hall, And pacing on through page and groom, Enter the Baron's presence-room. The Baron rose, and while he prest His gentle daughter to his breast, With cheerful wonder in his eyes The lady Geraldine espies, And gave such welcome to the same, As might beseem so bright a dame! But when he heard the lady's tale, And when she told her father's name, Why waxed Sir Leoline so pale, Murmuring o'er the name again, Lord Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine? Alas! they had been friends in youth; But whispering tongues can poison truth; And constancy lives in realms above; And life is thorny; and youth is vain; And to be wroth with one we love Doth work like madness in the brain. And thus it chanced, as I divine, With Roland and Sir Leoline. Each spake words of high disdain And insult to his heart's best brother: They parted—ne'er to meet again! But never either found another To free the hollow heart from paining— They stood aloof, the scars remaining, Like cliffs which had been rent asunder; A dreary sea now flows between;— But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder, Shall wholly do away, I ween, The marks of that which once hath been. Sir Leoline, a moment's space, Stood gazing on the damsel's face: And the youthful Lord of Tryermaine Came back upon his heart again. O then the Baron forgot his age, His noble heart swelled high with rage; He swore by the wounds in Jesu's side He would proclaim it far and wide, With trump and solemn heraldry, That they, who thus had wronged the dame, Were base as spotted infamy! ‘And if they dare deny the same, My herald shall appoint a week, And let the recreant traitors seek My tourney court—that there and then I may dislodge their reptile souls From the bodies and forms of men!’ He spake: his eye in lightning rolls! For the lady was ruthlessly seized; and he kenned In the beautiful lady the child of his friend! And now the tears were on his face, And fondly in his arms he took Fair Geraldine, who met the embrace, Prolonging it with joyous look. Which when she viewed, a vision fell Upon the soul of Christabel, The vision of fear, the touch and pain! She shrunk and shuddered, and saw again— (Ah, woe is me! Was it for thee, Thou gentle maid! such sights to see?) Again she saw that bosom old, Again she felt that bosom cold, And drew in her breath with a hissing sound: Whereat the Knight turned wildly round, And nothing saw, but his own sweet maid With eyes upraised, as one that prayed. The touch, the sight, had passed away, And in its stead that vision blest, Which comforted her after-rest While in the lady's arms she lay, Had put a rapture in her breast, And on her lips and o'er her eyes Spread smiles like light! With new surprise, ‘What ails then my belovéd child?’ The Baron said—His daughter mild Made answer, ‘All will yet be well!’ I ween, she had no power to tell Aught else: so mighty was the spell. Yet he, who saw this Geraldine, Had deemed her sure a thing divine: Such sorrow with such grace she blended, As if she feared she had offended Sweet Christabel, that gentle maid! And with such lowly tones she prayed She might be sent without delay Home to her father's mansion. ‘Nay! Nay, by my soul!’ said Leoline. ‘Ho! Bracy the bard, the charge be thine! Go thou, with music sweet and loud, And take two steeds with trappings proud, And take the youth whom thou lov'st best To bear thy harp, and learn thy song, And clothe you both in solemn vest, And over the mountains haste along, Lest wandering folk, that are abroad, Detain you on the valley road. ‘And when he has crossed the Irthing flood, My merry bard! he hastes, he hastes Up Knorren Moor, through Halegarth Wood, And reaches soon that castle good Which stands and threatens Scotland's wastes. ‘Bard Bracy! bard Bracy! your horses are fleet, Ye must ride up the hall, your music so sweet, More loud than your horses' echoing feet! And loud and loud to Lord Roland call, Thy daughter is safe in Langdale hall! Thy beautiful daughter is safe and free— Sir Leoline greets thee thus through me! He bids thee come without delay With all thy numerous array And take thy lovely daughter home: And he will meet thee on the way With all his numerous array White with their panting palfreys' foam: And, by mine honour! I will say, That I repent me of the day When I spake words of fierce disdain To Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine!— —For since that evil hour hath flown, Many a summer's sun hath shone; Yet ne'er found I a friend again Like Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine.’ The lady fell, and clasped his knees, Her face upraised, her eyes o'erflowing; And Bracy replied, with faltering voice, His gracious Hail on all bestowing!— ‘Thy words, thou sire of Christabel, Are sweeter than my harp can tell; Yet might I gain a boon of thee, This day my journey should not be, So strange a dream hath come to me, That I had vowed with music loud To clear yon wood from thing unblest, Warned by a vision in my rest! For in my sleep I saw that dove, That gentle bird, whom thou dost love, And call'st by thy own daughter's name— Sir Leoline! I saw the same Fluttering, and uttering fearful moan, Among the green herbs in the forest alone. Which when I saw and when I heard, I wonder'd what might ail the bird; For nothing near it could I see, Save the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree. ‘And in my dream methought I went To search out what might there be found; And what the sweet bird's trouble meant, That thus lay fluttering on the ground. I went and peered, and could descry No cause for her distressful cry; But yet for her dear lady's sake I stooped, methought, the dove to take, When lo! I saw a bright green snake Coiled around its wings and neck. Green as the herbs on which it couched, Close by the dove's its head it crouched; And with the dove it heaves and stirs, Swelling its neck as she swelled hers! I woke; it was the midnight hour, The clock was echoing in the tower; But though my slumber was gone by, This dream it would not pass away— It seems to live upon my eye! And thence I vowed this self-same day With music strong and saintly song To wander through the forest bare, Lest aught unholy loiter there.’ Thus Bracy said: the Baron, the while, Half-listening heard him with a smile; Then turned to Lady Geraldine, His eyes made up of wonder and love; And said in courtly accents fine, ‘Sweet maid, Lord Roland's beauteous dove, With arms more strong than harp or song, Thy sire and I will crush the snake!’ He kissed her forehead as he spake, And Geraldine in maiden wise Casting down her large bright eyes, With blushing cheek and courtesy fine She turned her from Sir Leoline; Softly gathering up her train, That o'er her right arm fell again; And folded her arms across her chest, And couched her head upon her breast, And looked askance at Christabel— Jesu, Maria, shield her well! A snake's small eye blinks dull and shy; And the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head, Each shrunk up to a serpent's eye, And with somewhat of malice, and more of dread, At Christabel she looked askance!— One moment—and the sight was fled! But Christabel in dizzy trance Stumbling on the unsteady ground Shuddered aloud, with a hissing sound; And Geraldine again turned round, And like a thing, that sought relief, Full of wonder and full of grief, She rolled her large bright eyes divine Wildly on Sir Leoline. The maid, alas! her thoughts are gone, She nothing sees—no sight but one! The maid, devoid of guile and sin, I know not how, in fearful wise, So deeply had she drunken in That look, those shrunken serpent eyes, That all her features were resigned To this sole image in her mind: And passively did imitate That look of dull and treacherous hate! And thus she stood, in dizzy trance, Still picturing that look askance With forced unconscious sympathy Full before her father's view— As far as such a look could be In eyes so innocent and blue! And when the trance was o'er, the maid Paused awhile, and inly prayed: Then falling at the Baron's feet, ‘By my mother's soul do I entreat That thou this woman send away!’ She said: and more she could not say: For what she knew she could not tell, O'er-mastered by the mighty spell. Why is thy cheek so wan and wild, Sir Leoline? Thy only child Lies at thy feet, thy joy, thy pride, So fair, so innocent, so mild; The same, for whom thy lady died! O by the pangs of her dear mother Think thou no evil of thy child! For her, and thee, and for no other, She prayed the moment ere she died: Prayed that the babe for whom she died, Might prove her dear lord's joy and pride! That prayer her deadly pangs beguiled, Sir Leoline! And wouldst thou wrong thy only child, Her child and thine? Within the Baron's heart and brain If thoughts, like these, had any share, They only swelled his rage and pain, And did but work confusion there. His heart was cleft with pain and rage, His cheeks they quivered, his eyes were wild, Dishonoured thus in his old age; Dishonoured by his only child, And all his hospitality To the wronged daughter of his friend By more than woman's jealousy Brought thus to a disgraceful end— He rolled his eye with stern regard Upon the gentle minstrel bard, And said in tones abrupt, austere— ‘Why, Bracy! dost thou loiter here? I bade thee hence!’ The bard obeyed; And turning from his own sweet maid, The agéd knight, Sir Leoline, Led forth the lady Geraldine! 1800. The Conclusion to Part II A little child, a limber elf, Singing, dancing to itself, A fairy thing with red round cheeks, That always finds, and never seeks, Makes such a vision to the sight As fills a father's eyes with light; And pleasures flow in so thick and fast Upon his heart, that he at last Must needs express his love's excess With words of unmeant bitterness. Perhaps 'tis pretty to force together Thoughts so all unlike each other; To mutter and mock a broken charm, To dally with wrong that does no harm. Perhaps 'tis tender too and pretty At each wild word to feel within A sweet recoil of love and pity. And what, if in a world of sin (O sorrow and shame should this be true!) Such giddiness of heart and brain Comes seldom save from rage and pain, So talks as it's most used to do. 1801. LINES TO W. L. WHILE HE SANG A SONG TO PURCELL'S MUSIC While my young cheek retains its healthful hues, And I have many friends who hold me dear, L—! methinks, I would not often hear Such melodies as thine, lest I should lose All memory of the wrongs and sore distress For which my miserable brethren weep! But should uncomforted misfortunes steep My daily bread in tears and bitterness; And if at Death's dread moment I should lie With no belovéd face at my bed-side, To fix the last glance of my closing eye, Methinks such strains, breathed by my angel-guide, Would make me pass the cup of anguish by, Mix with the blest, nor know that I had died! 1797. FIRE, FAMINE, AND SLAUGHTER A WAR ECLOGUE The Scene a desolated Tract in La Vendée. Famine is discovered lying on the ground; to her enter Fire and Slaughter. Fam. Sisters! sisters! who sent you here? Slau. [to Fire]. I will whisper it in her ear. Fire. No! no! no! Spirits hear what spirits tell: 'Twill make a holiday in Hell. No! no! no! Myself, I named him once below, And all the souls, that damnéd be, Leaped up at once in anarchy, Clapped their hands and danced for glee. They no longer heeded me; But laughed to hear Hell's burning rafters Unwillingly re-echo laughters! No! no! no! Spirits hear what spirits tell: 'Twill make a holiday in Hell! Fam. Whisper it, sister! so and so! In a dark hint, soft and slow. Slau. Letters four do form his name— And who sent you? Both. The same! the same! Slau. He came by stealth, and unlocked my den, And I have drunk the blood since then Of thrice three hundred thousand men. Both. Who bade you do 't? Slau. The same! the same! Letters four do form his name. He let me loose, and cried Halloo! To him alone the praise is due. Fam. Thanks, sister, thanks! the men have bled, Their wives and their children faint for bread. I stood in a swampy field of battle; With bones and skulls I made a rattle, To frighten the wolf and carrion-crow And the homeless dog—but they would not go. So off I flew: for how could I bear To see them gorge their dainty fare? I heard a groan and a peevish squall, And through the chink of a cottage-wall— Can you guess what I saw there? Both. Whisper it, sister! in our ear. Fam. A baby beat its dying mother: I had starved the one and was starving the other! Both. Who bade you do 't? Fam. The same! the same! Letters four do form his name. He let me loose, and cried, Halloo! To him alone the praise is due. Fire. Sisters! I from Ireland came! Hedge and corn-fields all on flame, I triumph'd o'er the setting sun! And all the while the work was done, On as I strode with my huge strides, I flung back my head and I held my sides, It was so rare a piece of fun To see the sweltered cattle run With uncouth gallop through the night, Scared by the red and noisy light! By the light of his own blazing cot Was many a naked Rebel shot: The house-stream met the flame and hissed, While crash! fell in the roof, I wist, On some of those old bed-rid nurses, That deal in discontent and curses. Both. Who bade you do 't? Fire. The same! the same! Letters four do form his name. He let me loose, and cried Halloo! To him alone the praise is due. All. He let us loose, and cried Halloo! How shall we yield him honour due? Fam. Wisdom comes with lack of food. I'll gnaw, I'll gnaw the multitude, Till the cup of rage o'erbrim: They shall seize him and his brood— Slau. They shall tear him limb from limb! Fire. O thankless beldames and untrue! And is this all that you can do For him, who did so much for you? Ninety months he, by my troth! Hath richly catered for you both; And in an hour would you repay An eight years' work?—Away! away! I alone am faithful! I Cling to him everlastingly. 1798. FROST AT MIDNIGHT The Frost performs its secret ministry, Unhelped by any wind. The owlet's cry Came loud—and hark, again! loud as before. The inmates of my cottage, all at rest, Have left me to that solitude, which suits Abstruser musings: save that at my side My cradled infant slumbers peacefully. 'Tis calm indeed! so calm, that it disturbs And vexes meditation with its strange And extreme silentness. Sea, hill, and wood, This populous village! Sea, and hill, and wood, With all the numberless goings-on of life, Inaudible as dreams! the thin blue flame Lies on my low-burnt fire, and quivers not; Only that film, which fluttered on the grate, Still flutters there, the sole unquiet thing. Methinks, its motion in this hush of nature Gives it dim sympathies with me who live, Making it a companionable form, Whose puny flaps and freaks the idling Spirit By its own moods interprets, every where Echo or mirror seeking of itself, And makes a toy of Thought. But O! how oft, How oft, at school, with most believing mind, Presageful, have I gazed upon the bars, To watch that fluttering stranger! and as oft With unclosed lids, already had I dreamt Of my sweet birth-place, and the old church-tower, Whose bells, the poor man's only music, rang From morn to evening, all the hot Fair-day, So sweetly, that they stirred and haunted me With a wild pleasure, falling on mine ear Most like articulate sounds of things to come! So gazed I, till the soothing things, I dreamt, Lulled me to sleep, and sleep prolonged my dreams! And so I brooded all the following morn, Awed by the stern preceptor's face, mine eye Fixed with mock study on my swimming book: Save if the door half opened, and I snatched A hasty glance, and still my heart leaped up, For still I hoped to see the stranger's face, Townsman, or aunt, or sister more beloved, My play-mate when we both were clothed alike! Dear Babe, that sleepest cradled by my side, Whose gentle breathings, heard in this deep calm, Fill up the intersperséd vacancies And momentary pauses of the thought! My babe so beautiful! it thrills my heart With tender gladness, thus to look at thee, And think that thou shalt learn far other lore, And in far other scenes! For I was reared In the great city, pent 'mid cloisters dim, And saw nought lovely but the sky and stars. But thou, my babe! shalt wander like a breeze By lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags Of ancient mountain, and beneath the clouds, Which image in their bulk both lakes and shores And mountain crags: so shalt thou see and hear The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible Of that eternal language, which thy God Utters, who from eternity doth teach Himself in all, and all things in himself. Great universal Teacher! he shall mould Thy spirit, and by giving make it ask. Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee, Whether the summer clothe the general earth With greenness, or the redbreast sit and sing Betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch Of mossy apple-tree, while the nigh thatch Smokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall Heard only in the trances of the blast, Or if the secret ministry of frost Shall hang them up in silent icicles, Quietly shining to the quiet Moon. February, 1798. FRANCE: AN ODE I Ye Clouds! that far above me float and pause, Whose pathless march no mortal may controul! Ye Ocean-Waves! that, wheresoe'er ye roll, Yield homage only to eternal laws! Ye Woods! that listen to the night-birds singing, Midway the smooth and perilous slope reclined, Save when your own imperious branches swinging, Have made a solemn music of the wind! Where, like a man beloved of God, Through glooms, which never woodman trod, How oft, pursuing fancies holy, My moonlight way o'er flowering weeds I wound, Inspired, beyond the guess of folly, By each rude shape and wild unconquerable sound! O ye loud Waves! and O ye Forests high! And O ye Clouds that far above me soared! Thou rising Sun! thou blue rejoicing Sky! Yea, every thing that is and will be free! Bear witness for me, wheresoe'er ye be, With what deep worship I have still adored The spirit of divinest Liberty. II When France in wrath her giant-limbs upreared, And with that oath, which smote air, earth, and sea, Stamped her strong foot and said she would be free, Bear witness for me, how I hoped and feared! With what a joy my lofty gratulation Unawed I sang, amid a slavish band: And when to whelm the disenchanted nation, Like fiends embattled by a wizard's wand, The Monarchs marched in evil day, And Britain joined the dire array; Though dear her shores and circling ocean, Though many friendships, many youthful loves Had swoln the patriot emotion And flung a magic light o'er all her hills and groves; Yet still my voice, unaltered, sang defeat To all that braved the tyrant-quelling lance, And shame too long delayed and vain retreat! For ne'er, O Liberty! with partial aim I dimmed thy light or damped thy holy flame; But blessed the paeans of delivered France, And hung my head and wept at Britain's name. III ‘And what,’ I said, ‘though Blasphemy's loud scream With that sweet music of deliverance strove! Though all the fierce and drunken passions wove A dance more wild than e'er was maniac's dream! Ye storms, that round the dawning East assembled, The Sun was rising, though ye hid his light!’ And when, to soothe my soul, that hoped and trembled, The dissonance ceased, and all seemed calm and bright; When France her front deep-scarr'd and gory Concealed with clustering wreaths of glory; When, insupportably advancing, Her arm made mockery of the warrior's ramp; While timid looks of fury glancing, Domestic treason, crushed beneath her fatal stamp, Writhed like a wounded dragon in his gore; Then I reproached my fears that would not flee; ‘And soon,’ I said, ‘shall Wisdom teach her lore In the low huts of them that toil and groan! And, conquering by her happiness alone, Shall France compel the nations to be free, Till Love and Joy look round, and call the Earth their own.’ IV Forgive me, Freedom! O forgive those dreams! I hear thy voice, I hear thy loud lament, From bleak Helvetia's icy caverns sent— I hear thy groans upon her blood-stained streams! Heroes, that for your peaceful country perished, And ye that, fleeing, spot your mountain-snows With bleeding wounds; forgive me, that I cherished One thought that ever blessed your cruel foes! To scatter rage, and traitorous guilt, Where Peace her jealous home had built; A patriot-race to disinherit Of all that made their stormy wilds so dear; And with inexpiable spirit To taint the bloodless freedom of the mountaineer— O France, that mockest Heaven, adulterous, blind, And patriot only in pernicious toils! Are these thy boasts, Champion of human kind? To mix with Kings in the low lust of sway, Yell in the hunt, and share the murderous prey; To insult the shrine of Liberty with spoils From freemen torn; to tempt and to betray? V The Sensual and the Dark rebel in vain, Slaves by their own compulsion! In mad game They burst their manacles and wear the name Of Freedom, graven on a heavier chain! O Liberty! with profitless endeavour Have I pursued thee, many a weary hour; But thou nor swell'st the victor's strain, nor ever Didst breathe thy soul in forms of human power. Alike from all, howe'er they praise thee, (Nor prayer, nor boastful name delays thee) Alike from Priestcraft's harpy minions, And factious Blasphemy's obscener slaves, Thou speedest on thy subtle pinions, The guide of homeless winds, and playmate of the waves! And there I felt thee!—on that sea-cliff's verge, Whose pines, scarce travelled by the breeze above, Had made one murmur with the distant surge! Yes, while I stood and gazed, my temples bare, And shot my being through earth, sea, and air, Possessing all things with intensest love, O Liberty! my spirit felt thee there. February, 1798. THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS Stranger! whose eyes a look of pity shew, Say, will you listen to a tale of woe? A tale in no unwonted horrors drest; But sweet is pity to an agéd breast. This voice did falter with old age before; Sad recollections make it falter more. Beside the torrent and beneath a wood, High in these Alps my summer cottage stood; One daughter still remain'd to cheer my way, The evening-star of life's declining day: Duly she hied to fill her milking-pail, Ere shout of herdsmen rang from cliff or vale; When she return'd, before the summer shiel, On the fresh grass she spread the dairy meal; Just as the snowy peaks began to lose In glittering silver lights their rosy hues. Singing in woods or bounding o'er the lawn, No blither creature hail'd the early dawn; And if I spoke of hearts by pain oppress'd, When every friend is gone to them that rest; Or of old men that leave, when they expire, Daughters, that should have perish'd with their sire— Leave them to toil all day through paths unknown, And house at night behind some sheltering stone; Impatient of the thought, with lively cheer She broke half-closed the tasteless tale severe. She play'd with fancies of a gayer hue, Enamour'd of the scenes her wishes drew; And oft she prattled with an eager tongue Of promised joys that would not loiter long, Till with her tearless eyes so bright and fair, She seem'd to see them realis'd in air! In fancy oft, within some sunny dell, Where never wolf should howl or tempest yell, She built a little home of joy and rest, And fill'd it with the friends whom she lov'd best: She named the inmates of her fancied cot, And gave to each his own peculiar lot; Which with our little herd abroad should roam, And which should tend the dairy's toil at home, And now the hour approach'd which should restore Her lover from the wars, to part no more. Her whole frame fluttered with uneasy joy; I long'd myself to clasp the valiant boy; And though I strove to calm her eager mood, It was my own sole thought in solitude. I told it to the Saints amid my hymns— For O! you know not, on an old man's limbs How thrillingly the pleasant sun-beams play, That shine upon his daughter's wedding-day. I hoped, that those fierce tempests, soon to rave Unheard, unfelt, around my mountain grave, Not undelightfully would break her rest, While she lay pillow'd on her lover's breast; Or join'd his pious prayer for pilgrims driven Out to the mercy of the winds of heaven. Yes! now the hour approach'd that should restore Her lover from the wars to part no more. Her thoughts were wild, her soul was in her eye, She wept and laugh'd as if she knew not why; And she had made a song about the wars, And sang it to the sun and to the stars! But while she look'd and listen'd, stood and ran, And saw him plain in every distant man, By treachery stabbed, on Nansy's murderous day, A senseless corse th' expected husband lay. A wounded man, who met us in the wood, Heavily ask'd her where my cottage stood, And told us all: she cast her eyes around As if his words had been but empty sound. Then look'd to Heav'n, like one that would deny That such a thing could be beneath the sky. Again he ask'd her if she knew my name, And instantly an anguish wrench'd her frame, And left her mind imperfect. No delight Thenceforth she found in any cheerful sight, Not ev'n in those time-haunted wells and groves, Scenes of past joy, and birth-place of her loves. If to her spirit any sound was dear, 'Twas the deep moan that spoke the tempest near; Or sighs which chasms of icy vales outbreathe, Sent from the dark, imprison'd floods beneath. She wander'd up the crag and down the slope, But not, as in her happy days of hope, To seek the churning-plant of sovereign power, That grew in clefts and bore a scarlet flower! She roam'd, without a purpose, all alone, Thro' high grey vales unknowing and unknown. Kind-hearted stranger! patiently you hear A tedious tale: I thank you for that tear. May never other tears o'ercloud your eye, Than those which gentle Pity can supply! Did you not mark a towering convent hang, Where the huge rocks with sounds of torrents rang? Ev'n yet, methinks, its spiry turrets swim Amid yon purple gloom ascending dim! For thither oft would my poor child repair, To ease her soul by penitence and prayer. I knew that peace at good men's prayers returns Home to the contrite heart of him that mourns, And check'd her not; and often there she found A timely pallet when the evening frown'd. And there I trusted that my child would light On shelter and on food, one dreadful night, When there was uproar in the element, And she was absent. To my rest I went: I thought her safe, yet often did I wake And felt my very heart within me ache. No daughter near me, at this very door, Next morn I listen'd to the dying roar. Above, below, the prowling vulture wail'd, And down the cliffs the heavy vapour sail'd. Up by the wide-spread waves in fury torn, Homestalls and pines along the vale were borne. The Dalesmen in thick crowds appear'd below Clearing the road, o'erwhelm'd with hills of snow. At times to the proud gust's ascending swell, A pack of blood-hounds flung their doleful yell: For after nights of storm, that dismal train The pious convent sends, with hope humane, To find some out-stretch'd man—perchance to save, Or give, at least, that last good gift, a grave! But now a gathering crowd did I survey, That slowly up the pasture bent their way; Nor could I doubt but that their care had found Some pilgrim in th' unchannel'd torrent drown'd. And down the lawn I hasten'd to implore That they would bring the body to my door; But soon exclaim'd a boy, who ran before, ‘Thrown by the last night's waters from their bed, Your daughter has been found, and she is dead!’ The old man paused—May he who, sternly just, Lays at his will his creatures in the dust; Some ere the earliest buds of hope be blown, And some, when every bloom of joy is flown; May he the parent to his child restore In that unchanging realm, where Love reigns evermore! March 8, 1798. Nicias Erythraeus. TO A YOUNG LADY [Miss Lavinia Poole] ON HER RECOVERY FROM A FEVER Why need I say, Louisa dear! How glad I am to see you here, A lovely convalescent; Risen from the bed of pain and fear, And feverish heat incessant. The sunny showers, the dappled sky, The little birds that warble high, Their vernal loves commencing, Will better welcome you than I With their sweet influencing. Believe me, while in bed you lay, Your danger taught us all to pray: You made us grow devouter! Each eye looked up and seemed to say, How can we do without her? Besides, what vexed us worse, we knew, They have no need of such as you In the place where you were going: This World has angels all too few, And Heaven is overflowing! March 31, 1798. LEWTI OR THE CIRCASSIAN LOVE-CHAUNT At midnight by the stream I roved, To forget the form I loved. Image of Lewti! from my mind Depart; for Lewti is not kind. The Moon was high, the moonlight gleam And the shadow of a star Heaved upon Tamaha's stream; But the rock shone brighter far, The rock half sheltered from my view By pendent boughs of tressy yew.— So shines my Lewti's forehead fair, Gleaming through her sable hair. Image of Lewti! from my mind Depart; for Lewti is not kind. I saw a cloud of palest hue, Onward to the moon it passed; Still brighter and more bright it grew, With floating colours not a few, Till it reached the moon at last: Then the cloud was wholly bright, With a rich and amber light! And so with many a hope I seek, And with such joy I find my Lewti; And even so my pale wan cheek Drinks in as deep a flush of beauty! Nay, treacherous image! leave my mind, If Lewti never will be kind. The little cloud—it floats away, Away it goes; away so soon! Alas! it has no power to stay: Its hues are dim, its hues are grey— Away it passes from the moon! How mournfully it seems to fly, Ever fading more and more, To joyless regions of the sky— And now 'tis whiter than before! As white as my poor cheek will be, When, Lewti! on my couch I lie, A dying man for love of thee. Nay, treacherous image! leave my mind— And yet, thou didst not look unkind. I saw a vapour in the sky, Thin, and white, and very high; I ne'er beheld so thin a cloud: Perhaps the breezes that can fly Now below and now above, Have snatched aloft the lawny shroud Of Lady fair—that died for love. For maids, as well as youths, have perished From fruitless love too fondly cherished. Nay, treacherous image! leave my mind— For Lewti never will be kind. Hush! my heedless feet from under Slip the crumbling banks for ever: Like echoes to a distant thunder, They plunge into the gentle river. The river-swans have heard my tread, And startle from their reedy bed. O beauteous birds! methinks ye measure Your movements to some heavenly tune! O beauteous birds! 'tis such a pleasure To see you move beneath the moon, I would it were your true delight To sleep by day and wake all night. I know the place where Lewti lies, When silent night has closed her eyes: It is a breezy jasmine-bower, The nightingale sings o'er her head: Voice of the Night! had I the power That leafy labyrinth to thread, And creep, like thee, with soundless tread, I then might view her bosom white Heaving lovely to my sight, As these two swans together heave On the gently-swelling wave. Oh! that she saw me in a dream, And dreamt that I had died for care; All pale and wasted I would seem, Yet fair withal, as spirits are! I'd die indeed, if I might see Her bosom heave, and heave for me! Soothe, gentle image! soothe my mind! To-morrow Lewti may be kind. 1798. FEARS IN SOLITUDE WRITTEN IN APRIL 1798, DURING THE ALARM OF AN INVASION A green and silent spot, amid the hills, A small and silent dell! O'er stiller place No singing sky-lark ever poised himself. The hills are heathy, save that swelling slope, Which hath a gay and gorgeous covering on, All golden with the never-bloomless furze, Which now blooms most profusely: but the dell, Bathed by the mist, is fresh and delicate As vernal corn-field, or the unripe flax, When, through its half-transparent stalks, at eve, The level sunshine glimmers with green light. Oh! 'tis a quiet spirit-healing nook! Which all, methinks, would love; but chiefly he, The humble man, who, in his youthful years, Knew just so much of folly, as had made His early manhood more securely wise! Here he might lie on fern or withered heath, While from the singing lark (that sings unseen The minstrelsy that solitude loves best), And from the sun, and from the breezy air, Sweet influences trembled o'er his frame; And he, with many feelings, many thoughts, Made up a meditative joy, and found Religious meanings in the forms of Nature! And so, his senses gradually wrapt In a half sleep, he dreams of better worlds, And dreaming hears thee still, O singing lark, That singest like an angel in the clouds! My God! it is a melancholy thing For such a man, who would full fain preserve His soul in calmness, yet perforce must feel For all his human brethren—O my God! It weighs upon the heart, that he must think What uproar and what strife may now be stirring This way or that way o'er these silent hills— Invasion, and the thunder and the shout, And all the crash of onset; fear and rage, And undetermined conflict—even now, Even now, perchance, and in his native isle: Carnage and groans beneath this blessed sun! We have offended, Oh! my countrymen! We have offended very grievously, And been most tyrannous. From east to west A groan of accusation pierces Heaven! The wretched plead against us; multitudes Countless and vehement, the sons of God, Our brethren! Like a cloud that travels on, Steamed up from Cairo's swamps of pestilence, Even so, my countrymen! have we gone forth And borne to distant tribes slavery and pangs, And, deadlier far, our vices, whose deep taint With slow perdition murders the whole man, His body and his soul! Meanwhile, at home, All individual dignity and power Engulfed in Courts, Committees, Institutions, Associations and Societies, A vain, speech-mouthing, speech-reporting Guild, One Benefit-Club for mutual flattery, We have drunk up, demure as at a grace, Pollutions from the brimming cup of wealth; Contemptuous of all honourable rule, Yet bartering freedom and the poor man's life For gold, as at a market! the sweet words Of Christian promise, words that even yet Might stem destruction, were they wisely preached, Are muttered o'er by men, whose tones proclaim How flat and wearisome they feel their trade: Rank scoffers some, but most too indolent To deem them falsehoods or to know their truth. Oh! blasphemous! the Book of Life is made A superstitious instrument, on which We gabble o'er the oaths we mean to break; For all must swear—all and in every place, College and wharf, council and justice-court; All, all must swear, the briber and the bribed, Merchant and lawyer, senator and priest, The rich, the poor, the old man and the young; All, all make up one scheme of perjury, That faith doth reel; the very name of God Sounds like a juggler's charm; and, bold with joy, Forth from his dark and lonely hiding-place, (Portentous sight!) the owlet Atheism, Sailing on obscene wings athwart the noon, Drops his blue-fringéd lids, and holds them close, And hooting at the glorious sun in Heaven, Cries out, ‘Where is it?’ Thankless too for peace, (Peace long preserved by fleets and perilous seas) Secure from actual warfare, we have loved To swell the war-whoop, passionate for war! Alas! for ages ignorant of all Its ghastlier workings, (famine or blue plague, Battle, or siege, or flight through wintry snows,) We, this whole people, have been clamorous For war and bloodshed; animating sports, The which we pay for as a thing to talk of, Spectators and not combatants! No guess Anticipative of a wrong unfelt, No speculation on contingency, However dim and vague, too vague and dim To yield a justifying cause; and forth, (Stuffed out with big preamble, holy names, And adjurations of the God in Heaven,) We send our mandates for the certain death Of thousands and ten thousands! Boys and girls, And women, that would groan to see a child Pull off an insect's leg, all read of war, The best amusement for our morning meal! The poor wretch, who has learnt his only prayers From curses, who knows scarcely words enough To ask a blessing from his Heavenly Father, Becomes a fluent phraseman, absolute And technical in victories and defeats, And all our dainty terms for fratricide; Terms which we trundle smoothly o'er our tongues Like mere abstractions, empty sounds to which We join no feeling and attach no form! As if the soldier died without a wound; As if the fibres of this godlike frame Were gored without a pang; as if the wretch, Who fell in battle, doing bloody deeds, Passed off to Heaven, translated and not killed; As though he had no wife to pine for him, No God to judge him! Therefore, evil days Are coming on us, O my countrymen! And what if all-avenging Providence, Strong and retributive, should make us know The meaning of our words, force us to feel The desolation and the agony Of our fierce doings? Spare us yet awhile, Father and God! O! spare us yet awhile! Oh! let not English women drag their flight Fainting beneath the burthen of their babes, Of the sweet infants, that but yesterday Laughed at the breast! Sons, brothers, husbands, all Who ever gazed with fondness on the forms Which grew up with you round the same fire-side, And all who ever heard the sabbath-bells Without the infidel's scorn, make yourselves pure! Stand forth! be men! repel an impious foe, Impious and false, a light yet cruel race, Who laugh away all virtue, mingling mirth With deeds of murder; and still promising Freedom, themselves too sensual to be free, Poison life's amities, and cheat the heart Of faith and quiet hope, and all that soothes, And all that lifts the spirit! Stand we forth; Render them back upon the insulted ocean, And let them toss as idly on its waves As the vile sea-weed, which some mountain-blast Swept from our shores! And oh! may we return Not with a drunken triumph, but with fear, Repenting of the wrongs with which we stung So fierce a foe to frenzy! I have told, O Britons! O my brethren! I have told Most bitter truth, but without bitterness. Nor deem my zeal or factious or mistimed; For never can true courage dwell with them, Who, playing tricks with conscience, dare not look At their own vices. We have been too long Dupes of a deep delusion! Some, belike, Groaning with restless enmity, expect All change from change of constituted power; As if a Government had been a robe, On which our vice and wretchedness were tagged Like fancy-points and fringes, with the robe Pulled off at pleasure. Fondly these attach A radical causation to a few Poor drudges of chastising Providence, Who borrow all their hues and qualities From our own folly and rank wickedness, Which gave them birth and nursed them. Others, meanwhile, Dote with a mad idolatry; and all Who will not fall before their images, And yield them worship, they are enemies Even of their country! Such have I been deemed.— But, O dear Britain! O my Mother Isle! Needs must thou prove a name most dear and holy To me, a son, a brother, and a friend, A husband, and a father! who revere All bonds of natural love, and find them all Within the limits of thy rocky shores. O native Britain! O my Mother Isle! How shouldst thou prove aught else but dear and holy To me, who from thy lakes and mountain-hills, Thy clouds, thy quiet dales, thy rocks and seas, Have drunk in all my intellectual life, All sweet sensations, all ennobling thoughts, All adoration of the God in nature, All lovely and all honourable things, Whatever makes this mortal spirit feel The joy and greatness of its future being? There lives nor form nor feeling in my soul Unborrowed from my country! O divine And beauteous island! thou hast been my sole And most magnificent temple, in the which I walk with awe, and sing my stately songs, Loving the God that made me!— May my fears, My filial fears, be vain! and may the vaunts And menace of the vengeful enemy Pass like the gust, that roared and died away In the distant tree: which heard, and only heard In this low dell, bowed not the delicate grass. But now the gentle dew-fall sends abroad The fruit-like perfume of the golden furze: The light has left the summit of the hill, Though still a sunny gleam lies beautiful, Aslant the ivied beacon. Now farewell, Farewell, awhile, O soft and silent spot! On the green sheep-track, up the heathy hill, Homeward I wind my way; and lo! recalled From bodings that have well-nigh wearied me, I find myself upon the brow, and pause Startled! And after lonely sojourning In such a quiet and surrounded nook, This burst of prospect, here the shadowy main, Dim-tinted, there the mighty majesty Of that huge amphitheatre of rich And elmy fields, seems like society— Conversing with the mind, and giving it A livelier impulse and a dance of thought! And now, belovéd Stowey! I behold Thy church-tower, and, methinks, the four huge elms Clustering, which mark the mansion of my friend; And close behind them, hidden from my view, Is my own lowly cottage, where my babe And my babe's mother dwell in peace! With light And quickened footsteps thitherward I tend, Remembering thee, O green and silent dell! And grateful, that by nature's quietness And solitary musings, all my heart Is softened, and made worthy to indulge Love, and the thoughts that yearn for human kind. Nether Stowey, April 20, 1798. THE NIGHTINGALE A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798 No cloud, no relique of the sunken day Distinguishes the West, no long thin slip Of sullen light, no obscure trembling hues. Come, we will rest on this old mossy bridge! You see the glimmer of the stream beneath, But hear no murmuring: it flows silently, O'er its soft bed of verdure. All is still, A balmy night! and though the stars be dim, Yet let us think upon the vernal showers That gladden the green earth, and we shall find A pleasure in the dimness of the stars. And hark! the Nightingale begins its song, ‘Most musical, most melancholy’ bird! A melancholy bird? Oh! idle thought! In Nature there is nothing melancholy. But some night-wandering man whose heart was pierced With the remembrance of a grievous wrong, Or slow distemper, or neglected love, (And so, poor wretch! filled all things with himself, And made all gentle sounds tell back the tale Of his own sorrow) he, and such as he, First named these notes a melancholy strain. And many a poet echoes the conceit; Poet who hath been building up the rhyme When he had better far have stretched his limbs Beside a brook in mossy forest-dell, By sun or moon-light, to the influxes Of shapes and sounds and shifting elements Surrendering his whole spirit, of his song And of his fame forgetful! so his fame Should share in Nature's immortality, A venerable thing! and so his song Should make all Nature lovelier, and itself Be loved like Nature! But 'twill not be so; And youths and maidens most poetical, Who lose the deepening twilights of the spring In ball-rooms and hot theatres, they still Full of meek sympathy must heave their sighs O'er Philomela's pity-pleading strains. My Friend, and thou, our Sister! we have learnt A different lore: we may not thus profane Nature's sweet voices, always full of love And joyance! 'Tis the merry Nightingale That crowds, and hurries, and precipitates With fast thick warble his delicious notes, As he were fearful that an April night Would be too short for him to utter forth His love-chant, and disburthen his full soul Of all its music! And I know a grove Of large extent, hard by a castle huge, Which the great lord inhabits not; and so This grove is wild with tangling underwood, And the trim walks are broken up, and grass, Thin grass and king-cups grow within the paths. But never elsewhere in one place I knew So many nightingales; and far and near, In wood and thicket, over the wide grove, They answer and provoke each other's song, With skirmish and capricious passagings, And murmurs musical and swift jug jug, And one low piping sound more sweet than all— Stirring the air with such a harmony, That should you close your eyes, you might almost Forget it was not day! On moonlight bushes, Whose dewy leaflets are but half-disclosed, You may perchance behold them on the twigs, Their bright, bright eyes, their eyes both bright and full, Glistening, while many a glow-worm in the shade Lights up her love-torch. A most gentle Maid, Who dwelleth in her hospitable home Hard by the castle, and at latest eve (Even like a Lady vowed and dedicate To something more than Nature in the grove) Glides through the pathways; she knows all their notes, That gentle Maid! and oft, a moment's space, What time the moon was lost behind a cloud, Hath heard a pause of silence; till the moon Emerging, hath awakened earth and sky With one sensation, and those wakeful birds Have all burst forth in choral minstrelsy, As if some sudden gale had swept at once A hundred airy harps! And she hath watched Many a nightingale perch giddily On blossomy twig still swinging from the breeze, And to that motion tune his wanton song Like tipsy Joy that reels with tossing head. Farewell, O Warbler! till to-morrow eve, And you, my friends! farewell, a short farewell! We have been loitering long and pleasantly, And now for our dear homes.—That strain again! Full fain it would delay me! My dear babe, Who, capable of no articulate sound, Mars all things with his imitative lisp, How he would place his hand beside his ear, His little hand, the small forefinger up, And bid us listen! And I deem it wise To make him Nature's play-mate. He knows well The evening-star; and once, when he awoke In most distressful mood (some inward pain Had made up that strange thing, an infant's dream—) I hurried with him to our orchard-plot, And he beheld the moon, and, hushed at once, Suspends his sobs, and laughs most silently, While his fair eyes, that swam with undropped tears, Did glitter in the yellow moon-beam! Well!— It is a father's tale: But if that Heaven Should give me life, his childhood shall grow up Familiar with these songs, that with the night He may associate joy.—Once more, farewell, Sweet Nightingale! once more, my friends! farewell. 1798. THE THREE GRAVES A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE [Part I—From MS.] Beneath this thorn when I was young, This thorn that blooms so sweet, We loved to stretch our lazy limbs In summer's noon-tide heat. And hither too the old man came, The maiden and her feer, ‘Then tell me, Sexton, tell me why The toad has harbour here. ‘The Thorn is neither dry nor dead, But still it blossoms sweet; Then tell me why all round its roots The dock and nettle meet. ‘Why here the hemlock, &amp;c. [sic in MS.] ‘Why these three graves all side by side, Beneath the flow'ry thorn, Stretch out so green and dark a length, By any foot unworn.’ There, there a ruthless mother lies Beneath the flowery thorn; And there a barren wife is laid, And there a maid forlorn. The barren wife and maid forlorn Did love each other dear; The ruthless mother wrought the woe, And cost them many a tear. Fair Ellen was of serious mind, Her temper mild and even, And Mary, graceful as the fir That points the spire to heaven. Young Edward he to Mary said, ‘I would you were my bride,’ And she was scarlet as he spoke, And turned her face to hide. ‘You know my mother she is rich, And you have little gear; And go and if she say not Nay, Then I will be your fere.’ Young Edward to the mother went, To him the mother said: ‘In truth you are a comely man; You shall my daughter wed.’ [In Mary's joy fair Eleanor Did bear a sister's part; For why, though not akin in blood, They sisters were in heart.] Small need to tell to any man That ever shed a tear What passed within the lover's heart The happy day so near. The mother, more than mothers use, Rejoiced when they were by; And all the ‘course of wooing’ passed Beneath the mother's eye. And here within the flowering thorn How deep they drank of joy: The mother fed upon the sight, Nor . . . [sic in MS.] [Part II—From MS.] And now the wedding day was fix'd, The wedding-ring was bought; The wedding-cake with her own hand The ruthless mother brought. ‘And when to-morrow's sun shines forth The maid shall be a bride’; Thus Edward to the mother spake While she sate by his side. Alone they sate within the bower: The mother's colour fled, For Mary's foot was heard above— She decked the bridal bed. And when her foot was on the stairs To meet her at the door, With steady step the mother rose, And silent left the bower. She stood, her back against the door, And when her child drew near— ‘Away! away!’ the mother cried, ‘Ye shall not enter here. ‘Would ye come here, ye maiden vile, And rob me of my mate?’ And on her child the mother scowled A deadly leer of hate. Fast rooted to the spot, you guess, The wretched maiden stood, As pale as any ghost of night That wanteth flesh and blood. She did not groan, she did not fall, She did not shed a tear, Nor did she cry, ‘Oh! mother, why May I not enter here?’ But wildly up the stairs she ran, As if her sense was fled, And then her trembling limbs she threw Upon the bridal bed. The mother she to Edward went Where he sate in the bower, And said, ‘That woman is not fit To be your paramour. ‘She is my child—it makes my heart With grief and trouble swell; I rue the hour that gave her birth, For never worse befel. ‘For she is fierce and she is proud, And of an envious mind; A wily hypocrite she is, And giddy as the wind. ‘And if you go to church with her, You'll rue the bitter smart; For she will wrong your marriage-bed, And she will break your heart. ‘Oh God, to think that I have shared Her deadly sin so long; She is my child, and therefore I As mother held my tongue. ‘She is my child, I've risked for her My living soul's estate: I cannot say my daily prayers, The burthen is so great. ‘And she would scatter gold about Until her back was bare; And should you swing for lust of hers In truth she'd little care.’ Then in a softer tone she said, And took him by the hand: ‘Sweet Edward, for one kiss of your's I'd give my house and land. ‘And if you'll go to church with me, And take me for your bride, I'll make you heir of all I have— Nothing shall be denied.’ Then Edward started from his seat, And he laughed loud and long— ‘In truth, good mother, you are mad, Or drunk with liquor strong.’ To him no word the mother said, But on her knees she fell, And fetched her breath while thrice your hand Might toll the passing-bell. ‘Thou daughter now above my head, Whom in my womb I bore, May every drop of thy heart's blood Be curst for ever more. ‘And curséd be the hour when first I heard thee wawl and cry; And in the Church-yard curséd be The grave where thou shalt lie!’ And Mary on the bridal-bed Her mother's curse had heard; And while the cruel mother spake The bed beneath her stirred. In wrath young Edward left the hall, And turning round he sees The mother looking up to God And still upon her knees. Young Edward he to Mary went When on the bed she lay; ‘Sweet love, this is a wicked house— Sweet love, we must away.’ He raised her from the bridal-bed, All pale and wan with fear; ‘No Dog,’ quoth he, ‘if he were mine, No Dog would kennel here.’ He led her from the bridal-bed, He led her from the stairs. [Had sense been hers she had not dar'd To venture on her prayers. MS. erased.] The mother still was in the bower, And with a greedy heart She drank perdition on her knees, Which never may depart. But when their steps were heard below On God she did not call; She did forget the God of Heaven, For they were in the hall. She started up—the servant maid Did see her when she rose; And she has oft declared to me The blood within her froze. As Edward led his bride away And hurried to the door, The ruthless mother springing forth Stopped midway on the floor. What did she mean? What did she mean? For with a smile she cried: ‘Unblest ye shall not pass my door, The bride-groom and his bride. ‘Be blithe as lambs in April are, As flies when fruits are red; May God forbid that thought of me Should haunt your marriage-bed. ‘And let the night be given to bliss, The day be given to glee: I am a woman weak and old, Why turn a thought on me? ‘What can an agéd mother do, And what have ye to dread? A curse is wind, it hath no shape To haunt your marriage-bed.’ When they were gone and out of sight She rent her hoary hair, And foamed like any Dog of June When sultry sun-beams glare. Now ask you why the barren wife, And why the maid forlorn, And why the ruthless mother lies Beneath the flowery thorn? Three times, three times this spade of mine, In spite of bolt or bar, Did from beneath the belfry come, When spirits wandering are. And when the mother's soul to Hell By howling fiends was borne, This spade was seen to mark her grave Beneath the flowery thorn. And when the death-knock at the door Called home the maid forlorn, This spade was seen to mark her grave Beneath the flowery thorn. And 'tis a fearful, fearful tree; The ghosts that round it meet, 'Tis they that cut the rind at night, Yet still it blossoms sweet. [End of MS.] Part III The grapes upon the Vicar's wall Were ripe as ripe could be; And yellow leaves in sun and wind Were falling from the tree. On the hedge-elms in the narrow lane Still swung the spikes of corn: Dear Lord! it seems but yesterday— Young Edward's marriage-morn. Up through that wood behind the church, There leads from Edward's door A mossy track, all over boughed, For half a mile or more. And from their house-door by that track The bride and bridegroom went; Sweet Mary, though she was not gay, Seemed cheerful and content. But when they to the church-yard came, I've heard poor Mary say, As soon as she stepped into the sun, Her heart it died away. And when the Vicar join'd their hands, Her limbs did creep and freeze: But when they prayed, she thought she saw Her mother on her knees. And o'er the church-path they returned— I saw poor Mary's back, Just as she stepped beneath the boughs Into the mossy track. Her feet upon the mossy track The married maiden set: That moment—I have heard her say— She wished she could forget. The shade o'er-flushed her limbs with heat— Then came a chill like death: And when the merry bells rang out, They seemed to stop her breath. Beneath the foulest mother's curse No child could ever thrive: A mother is a mother still, The holiest thing alive. So five months passed: the mother still Would never heal the strife; But Edward was a loving man And Mary a fond wife. ‘My sister may not visit us, My mother says her nay: O Edward! you are all to me, I wish for your sake I could be More lifesome and more gay. ‘I'm dull and sad! indeed, indeed I know I have no reason! Perhaps I am not well in health, And 'tis a gloomy season.’ 'Twas a drizzly time—no ice, no snow! And on the few fine days She stirred not out, lest she might meet Her mother in the ways. But Ellen, spite of miry ways And weather dark and dreary, Trudged every day to Edward's house, And made them all more cheery. Oh! Ellen was a faithful friend, More dear than any sister! As cheerful too as singing lark; And she ne'er left them till 'twas dark, And then they always missed her. And now Ash-Wednesday came—that day But few to church repair: For on that day you know we read The Commination prayer. Our late old Vicar, a kind man, Once, Sir, he said to me, He wished that service was clean out Of our good Liturgy. The mother walked into the church— To Ellen's seat she went: Though Ellen always kept her church All church-days during Lent. And gentle Ellen welcomed her With courteous looks and mild: Thought she, ‘What if her heart should melt, And all be reconciled!’ The day was scarcely like a day— The clouds were black outright: And many a night, with half a moon, I've seen the church more light. The wind was wild; against the glass The rain did beat and bicker; The church-tower swinging over head, You scarce could hear the Vicar! And then and there the mother knelt, And audibly she cried— ‘Oh! may a clinging curse consume This woman by my side! ‘O hear me, hear me, Lord in Heaven, Although you take my life— O curse this woman, at whose house Young Edward woo'd his wife. ‘By night and day, in bed and bower, O let her curséd be!!!’ So having prayed, steady and slow, She rose up from her knee! And left the church, nor e'er again The church-door entered she. I saw poor Ellen kneeling still, So pale! I guessed not why: When she stood up, there plainly was A trouble in her eye. And when the prayers were done, we all Came round and asked her why: Giddy she seemed, and sure, there was A trouble in her eye. But ere she from the church-door stepped She smiled and told us why: ‘It was a wicked woman's curse,’ Quoth she, ‘and what care I?’ She smiled, and smiled, and passed it off Ere from the door she stept— But all agree it would have been Much better had she wept. And if her heart was not at ease, This was her constant cry— ‘It was a wicked woman's curse— God's good, and what care I?’ There was a hurry in her looks, Her struggles she redoubled: ‘It was a wicked woman's curse, And why should I be troubled?’ These tears will come—I dandled her When 'twas the merest fairy— Good creature! and she hid it all: She told it not to Mary. But Mary heard the tale: her arms Round Ellen's neck she threw; ‘O Ellen, Ellen, she cursed me, And now she hath cursed you!’ I saw young Edward by himself Stalk fast adown the lee, He snatched a stick from every fence, A twig from every tree. He snapped them still with hand or knee, And then away they flew! As if with his uneasy limbs He knew not what to do! You see, good sir! that single hill? His farm lies underneath: He heard it there, he heard it all, And only gnashed his teeth. Now Ellen was a darling love In all his joys and cares: And Ellen's name and Mary's name Fast-linked they both together came, Whene'er he said his prayers. And in the moment of his prayers He loved them both alike: Yea, both sweet names with one sweet joy Upon his heart did strike! He reach'd his home, and by his looks They saw his inward strife: And they clung round him with their arms, Both Ellen and his wife. And Mary could not check her tears, So on his breast she bowed; Then frenzy melted into grief, And Edward wept aloud. Dear Ellen did not weep at all, But closelier did she cling, And turned her face and looked as if She saw some frightful thing. Part IV To see a man tread over graves I hold it no good mark; 'Tis wicked in the sun and moon, And bad luck in the dark! You see that grave? The Lord he gives, The Lord, he takes away: O Sir! the child of my old age Lies there as cold as clay. Except that grave, you scarce see one That was not dug by me; I'd rather dance upon 'em all Than tread upon these three! ‘Aye, Sexton! 'tis a touching tale.’ You, Sir! are but a lad; This month I'm in my seventieth year, And still it makes me sad. And Mary's sister told it me, For three good hours and more; Though I had heard it, in the main, From Edward's self, before. Well! it passed off! the gentle Ellen Did well nigh dote on Mary; And she went oftener than before, And Mary loved her more and more: She managed all the dairy. To market she on market-days, To church on Sundays came; All seemed the same: all seemed so, Sir! But all was not the same! Had Ellen lost her mirth? Oh! no! But she was seldom cheerful; And Edward looked as if he thought That Ellen's mirth was fearful. When by herself, she to herself Must sing some merry rhyme; She could not now be glad for hours, Yet silent all the time. And when she soothed her friend, through all Her soothing words 'twas plain She had a sore grief of her own, A haunting in her brain. And oft she said, I'm not grown thin! And then her wrist she spanned; And once when Mary was down-cast, She took her by the hand, And gazed upon her, and at first She gently pressed her hand; Then harder, till her grasp at length Did gripe like a convulsion! ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘we ne'er can be Made happy by compulsion!’ And once her both arms suddenly Round Mary's neck she flung, And her heart panted, and she felt The words upon her tongue. She felt them coming, but no power Had she the words to smother; And with a kind of shriek she cried, ‘Oh Christ! you're like your mother!’ So gentle Ellen now no more Could make this sad house cheery; And Mary's melancholy ways Drove Edward wild and weary. Lingering he raised his latch at eve, Though tired in heart and limb: He loved no other place, and yet Home was no home to him. One evening he took up a book, And nothing in it read; Then flung it down, and groaning cried, ‘O! Heaven! that I were dead.’ Mary looked up into his face, And nothing to him said; She tried to smile, and on his arm Mournfully leaned her head. And he burst into tears, and fell Upon his knees in prayer: ‘Her heart is broke! O God! my grief, It is too great to bear!’ 'Twas such a foggy time as makes Old sextons, Sir! like me, Rest on their spades to cough; the spring Was late uncommonly. And then the hot days, all at once, They came, we knew not how: You looked about for shade, when scarce A leaf was on a bough. It happened then ('twas in the bower, A furlong up the wood: Perhaps you know the place, and yet I scarce know how you should,) No path leads thither, 'tis not nigh To any pasture-plot; But clustered near the chattering brook, Lone hollies marked the spot. Those hollies of themselves a shape As of an arbour took, A close, round arbour; and it stands Not three strides from a brook. Within this arbour, which was still With scarlet berries hung, Were these three friends, one Sunday morn, Just as the first bell rung. 'Tis sweet to hear a brook, 'tis sweet To hear the Sabbath-bell, 'Tis sweet to hear them both at once, Deep in a woody dell. His limbs along the moss, his head Upon a mossy heap, With shut-up senses, Edward lay: That brook e'en on a working day Might chatter one to sleep. And he had passed a restless night, And was not well in health; The women sat down by his side, And talked as 'twere by stealth. ‘The Sun peeps through the close thick leaves, See, dearest Ellen! see! 'Tis in the leaves, a little sun, No bigger than your ee; ‘A tiny sun, and it has got A perfect glory too; Ten thousand threads and hairs of light, Make up a glory gay and bright Round that small orb, so blue.’ And then they argued of those rays, What colour they might be; Says this, ‘They're mostly green’; says that, ‘They're amber-like to me.’ So they sat chatting, while bad thoughts Were troubling Edward's rest; But soon they heard his hard quick pants, And the thumping in his breast. ‘A mother too!’ these self-same words Did Edward mutter plain; His face was drawn back on itself, With horror and huge pain. Both groaned at once, for both knew well What thoughts were in his mind; When he waked up, and stared like one That hath been just struck blind. He sat upright; and ere the dream Had had time to depart, ‘O God, forgive me!’ (he exclaimed) ‘I have torn out her heart.’ Then Ellen shrieked, and forthwith burst Into ungentle laughter; And Mary shivered, where she sat, And never she smiled after. 1797–1809.

THE BALLAD OF THE DARK LADIE A FRAGMENT Beneath yon birch with silver bark, And boughs so pendulous and fair, The brook falls scatter'd down the rock: And all is mossy there! And there upon the moss she sits, The Dark Ladié in silent pain; The heavy tear is in her eye, And drops and swells again. Three times she sends her little page Up the castled mountain's breast, If he might find the Knight that wears The Griffin for his crest. The sun was sloping down the sky, And she had linger'd there all day, Counting moments, dreaming fears— Oh wherefore can he stay? She hears a rustling o'er the brook, She sees far off a swinging bough! ‘'Tis He! 'Tis my betrothéd Knight! Lord Falkland, it is Thou!’ She springs, she clasps him round the neck, She sobs a thousand hopes and fears, Her kisses glowing on his cheeks She quenches with her tears. ‘My friends with rude ungentle words They scoff and bid me fly to thee! O give me shelter in thy breast! O shield and shelter me! ‘My Henry, I have given thee much, I gave what I can ne'er recall, I gave my heart, I gave my peace, O Heaven! I gave thee all.’ The Knight made answer to the Maid, While to his heart he held her hand, ‘Nine castles hath my noble sire, None statelier in the land. ‘The fairest one shall be my love's, The fairest castle of the nine! Wait only till the stars peep out, The fairest shall be thine: ‘Wait only till the hand of eve Hath wholly closed yon western bars, And through the dark we two will steal Beneath the twinkling stars!’— ‘The dark? the dark? No! not the dark? The twinkling stars? How, Henry? How?’ O God! 'twas in the eye of noon He pledged his sacred vow! And in the eye of noon my love Shall lead me from my mother's door, Sweet boys and girls all clothed in white Strewing flowers before: But first the nodding minstrels go With music meet for lordly bowers, The children next in snow-white vests, Strewing buds and flowers! And then my love and I shall pace, My jet black hair in pearly braids, Between our comely bachelors And blushing bridal maids. 1798. KUBLA KHAN: Or, A Vision in a Dream. A Fragment. The following fragment is here published at the request of a poet of great and deserved celebrity [Lord Byron], and, as far as the Author's own opinions are concerned, rather as a psychological curiosity, than on the ground of any supposed poetic merits. In the summer of the year 1797, the Author, then in ill health, had retired to a lonely farm-house between Porlock and Linton, on the Exmoor confines of Somerset and Devonshire. In consequence of a slight indisposition, an anodyne had been prescribed, from the effects of which he fell asleep in his chair at the moment that he was reading the following sentence, or words of the same substance, in ‘Purchas's Pilgrimage’: ‘Here the Khan Kubla commanded a palace to be built, and a stately garden thereunto. And thus ten miles of fertile ground were inclosed with a wall.’ The Author continued for about three hours in a profound sleep, at least of the external senses, during which time he has the most vivid confidence, that he could not have composed less than from two to three hundred lines; if that indeed can be called composition in which all the images rose up before him as things, with a parallel production of the correspondent expressions, without any sensation or consciousness of effort. On awaking he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking his pen, ink, and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here preserved. At this moment he was unfortunately called out by a person on business from Porlock, and detained by him above an hour, and on his return to his room, found, to his no small surprise and mortification, that though he still retained some vague and dim recollection of the general purport of the vision, yet, with the exception of some eight or ten scattered lines and images, all the rest had passed away like the images on the surface of a stream into which a stone has been cast, but, alas! without the after restoration of the latter! Then all the charm Is broken—all that phantom-world so fair Vanishes, and a thousand circlets spread, And each mis-shape['s] the other. Stay awhile, Poor youth! who scarcely dar'st lift up thine eyes— The stream will soon renew its smoothness, soon The visions will return! And lo, he stays, And soon the fragments dim of lovely forms Come trembling back, unite, and now once more The pool becomes a mirror. [From The Picture; or, the Lover's Resolution, II. 91-100.] Yet from the still surviving recollections in his mind, the Author has frequently purposed to finish for himself what had been originally, as it were, given to him. ??????? ????? ??? [?????? ????? ??? 1834]: but the to-morrow is yet to come. As a contrast to this vision, I have annexed a fragment of a very different character, describing with equal fidelity the dream of pain and disease. In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree: Where Alph, the sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man Down to a sunless sea. So twice five miles of fertile ground With walls and towers were girdled round: And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills, Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; And here were forests ancient as the hills, Enfolding sunny spots of greenery. But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover! A savage place! as holy and enchanted As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon-lover! And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething, As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing, A mighty fountain momently was forced: Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail, Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail: And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever It flung up momently the sacred river. Five miles meandering with a mazy motion Through wood and dale the sacred river ran, Then reached the caverns measureless to man, And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean: And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far Ancestral voices prophesying war! The shadow of the dome of pleasure Floated midway on the waves; Where was heard the mingled measure From the fountain and the caves. It was a miracle of rare device, A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice! A damsel with a dulcimer In a vision once I saw: It was an Abyssinian maid, And on her dulcimer she played, Singing of Mount Abora. Could I revive within me Her symphony and song, To such a deep delight 'twould win me, That with music loud and long, I would build that dome in air, That sunny dome! those caves of ice! And all who heard should see them there, And all should cry, Beware! Beware! His flashing eyes, his floating hair! Weave a circle round him thrice, And close your eyes with holy dread, For he on honey-dew hath fed, And drunk the milk of Paradise. 1798. RECANTATION ILLUSTRATED IN THE STORY OF THE MAD OX I An Ox, long fed with musty hay, And work'd with yoke and chain, Was turn'd out on an April day, When fields are in their best array, And growing grasses sparkle gay At once with Sun and rain. II The grass was fine, the Sun was bright— With truth I may aver it; The ox was glad, as well he might, Thought a green meadow no bad sight, And frisk'd,—to shew his huge delight, Much like a beast of spirit. III ‘Stop, neighbours, stop, why these alarms? The ox is only glad!’ But still they pour from cots and farms— ‘Halloo!’ the parish is up in arms, (A hoaxing-hunt has always charms) ‘Halloo! the ox is mad.’ IV The frighted beast scamper'd about— Plunge! through the hedge he drove: The mob pursue with hideous rout, A bull-dog fastens on his snout; ‘He gores the dog! his tongue hangs out! He's mad, he's mad, by Jove!’ V ‘Stop, neighbours, stop!’ aloud did call A sage of sober hue. But all at once, on him they fall, And women squeak and children squall, ‘What? would you have him toss us all? And dam'me, who are you?’ VI Oh! hapless sage! his ears they stun, And curse him o'er and o'er! ‘You bloody-minded dog! (cries one,) To slit your windpipe were good fun, 'Od blast you for an impious son Of a Presbyterian wh—re!’ VII ‘You'd have him gore the Parish-priest, And run against the altar! You fiend!’ the sage his warnings ceas'd, And north and south, and west and east, Halloo! they follow the poor beast, Mat, Dick, Tom, Bob and Walter. VIII Old Lewis ('twas his evil day), Stood trembling in his shoes; The ox was his—what cou'd he say? His legs were stiffen'd with dismay, The ox ran o'er him mid the fray, And gave him his death's bruise. IX The frighted beast ran on—(but here, No tale, (tho' in print, more true is) My Muse stops short in mid career— Nay, gentle Reader, do not sneer! I cannot chuse but drop a tear, A tear for good old Lewis!) X The frighted beast ran through the town, All follow'd, boy and dad, Bull-dog, parson, shopman, clown: The publicans rush'd from the Crown, ‘Halloo! hamstring him! cut him down!’ They drove the poor Ox mad. XI Should you a Rat to madness tease Why ev'n a Rat may plague you: There's no Philosopher but sees That Rage and Fear are one disease— Though that may burn, and this may freeze, They're both alike the Ague. XII And so this Ox, in frantic mood, Fac'd round like any Bull! The mob turn'd tail, and he pursued, Till they with heat and fright were stew'd, And not a chick of all this brood But had his belly full! XIII Old Nick's astride the beast, 'tis clear! Old Nicholas, to a tittle! But all agree he'd disappear, Would but the Parson venture near, And through his teeth, right o'er the steer, Squirt out some fasting-spittle. XIV Achilles was a warrior fleet, The Trojans he could worry: Our Parson too was swift of feet, But shew'd it chiefly in retreat: The victor Ox scour'd down the street, The mob fled hurry-scurry. XV Through gardens, lanes and fields new-plough'd, Through his hedge, and through her hedge, He plung'd and toss'd and bellow'd loud— Till in his madness he grew proud To see this helter-skelter crowd That had more wrath than courage! XVI Alas! to mend the breaches wide He made for these poor ninnies, They all must work, whate'er betide, Both days and months, and pay beside (Sad news for Av'rice and for Pride), A sight of golden guineas! XVII But here once more to view did pop The man that kept his senses— And now he cried,—‘Stop, neighbours, stop! The Ox is mad! I would not swop, No! not a school-boy's farthing top For all the parish-fences.’ XVIII ‘The Ox is mad! Ho! Dick, Bob, Mat! ‘What means this coward fuss? Ho! stretch this rope across the plat— 'Twill trip him up—or if not that, Why, dam'me! we must lay him flat— See! here's my blunderbuss.’ XIX ‘A lying dog! just now he said The Ox was only glad— Let's break his Presbyterian head!’ ‘Hush!’ quoth the sage, ‘you've been misled; No quarrels now! let's all make head, You drove the poor Ox mad.’ XX As thus I sat, in careless chat, With the morning's wet newspaper, In eager haste, without his hat, As blind and blund'ring as a bat, In came that fierce Aristocrat, Our pursy woollen-draper. XXI And so my Muse per force drew bit; And in he rush'd and panted! ‘Well, have you heard?’ No, not a whit. ‘What, ha'nt you heard?’ Come, out with it! ‘That Tierney votes for Mister Pitt, And Sheridan's recanted!’ 1798. HEXAMETERS William, my teacher, my friend! dear William and dear Dorothea! Smooth out the folds of my letter, and place it on desk or on table; Place it on table or desk; and your right hands loosely half-closing, Gently sustain them in air, and extending the digit didactic, Rest it a moment on each of the forks of the five-forkéd left hand, Twice on the breadth of the thumb, and once on the tip of each finger; Read with a nod of the head in a humouring recitativo; And, as I live, you will see my hexameters hopping before you. This is a galloping measure; a hop, and a trot, and a gallop! All my hexameters fly, like stags pursued by the staghounds, Breathless and panting, and ready to drop, yet flying still onwards, I would full fain pull in my hard-mouthed runaway hunter; But our English Spondeans are clumsy yet impotent curbreins; And so to make him go slowly, no way left have I but to lame him. William, my head and my heart! dear Poet that feelest and thinkest! Dorothy, eager of soul, my most affectionate sister! Many a mile, O! many a wearisome mile are ye distant, Long, long comfortless roads, with no one eye that doth know us. O! it is all too far to send you mockeries idle: Yea, and I feel it not right! But O! my friends, my belovéd! Feverish and wakeful I lie,—I am weary of feeling and thinking. Every thought is worn down, I am weary yet cannot be vacant. Five long hours have I tossed, rheumatic heats, dry and flushing, Gnawing behind in my head, and wandering and throbbing about me, Busy and tiresome, my friends, as the beat of the boding night-spider. I forget the beginning of the line: . . . my eyes are a burthen, Now unwillingly closed, now open and aching with darkness. O! what a life is the eye! what a strange and inscrutable essence! Him that is utterly blind, nor glimpses the fire that warms him; Him that never beheld the swelling breast of his mother; Him that smiled in his gladness as a babe that smiles in its slumber; Even for him it exists, it moves and stirs in its prison; Lives with a separate life, and ‘Is it a Spirit?’ he murmurs: ‘Sure it has thoughts of its own, and to see is only a language.’ There was a great deal more, which I have forgotten. . . . The last line which I wrote, I remember, and write it for the truth of the sentiment, scarcely less true in company than in pain and solitude:— William, my head and my heart! dear William and dear Dorothea! You have all in each other; but I am lonely, and want you! 1798–9. TRANSLATION OF A PASSAGE IN OTTFRIED'S METRICAL PARAPHRASE OF THE GOSPEL [This paraphrase, written about the time of Charlemagne, is by no means deficient in occasional passages of considerable poetic merit. There is a flow and a tender enthusiasm in the following lines which even in the translation will not, I flatter myself, fail to interest the reader. Ottfried is describing the circumstances immediately following the birth of our Lord. Most interesting is it to consider the effect when the feelings are wrought above the natural pitch by the belief of something mysterious, while all the images are purely natural. Then it is that religion and poetry strike deepest. Biog. Lit., 1817, i. 203-4.] She gave with joy her virgin breast; She hid it not, she bared the breast Which suckled that divinest babe! Blessed, blessed were the breasts Which the Saviour infant kiss'd; And blessed, blessed was the mother Who wrapp'd his limbs in swaddling clothes, Singing placed him on her lap, Hung o'er him with her looks of love, And soothed him with a lulling motion. Blessed! for she shelter'd him From the damp and chilling air; Blessed, blessed! for she lay With such a babe in one blest bed, Close as babes and mothers lie! Blessed, blessed evermore, With her virgin lips she kiss'd, With her arms, and to her breast, She embraced the babe divine, Her babe divine the virgin mother! There lives not on this ring of earth A mortal that can sing her praise. Mighty mother, virgin pure, In the darkness and the night For us she bore the heavenly Lord! ?1799. CATULLIAN HENDECASYLLABLES Hear, my belovéd, an old Milesian story!— High, and embosom'd in congregated laurels, Glimmer'd a temple upon a breezy headland; In the dim distance amid the skiey billows Rose a fair island; the god of flocks had blest it. From the far shores of the bleat-resounding island Oft by the moonlight a little boat came floating, Came to the sea-cave beneath the breezy headland, Where amid myrtles a pathway stole in mazes Up to the groves of the high embosom'd temple. There in a thicket of dedicated roses, Oft did a priestess, as lovely as a vision, Pouring her soul to the son of Cytherea, Pray him to hover around the slight canoe-boat, And with invisible pilotage to guide it Over the dusk wave, until the nightly sailor Shivering with ecstasy sank upon her bosom. ?1799. THE HOMERIC HEXAMETER DESCRIBED AND EXEMPLIFIED Strongly it bears us along in swelling and limitless billows, Nothing before and nothing behind but the sky and the ocean. ?1799. THE OVIDIAN ELEGIAC METRE DESCRIBED AND EXEMPLIFIED In the hexameter rises the fountain's silvery column; In the pentameter aye falling in melody back. ?1799. ON A CATARACT FROM A CAVERN NEAR THE SUMMIT OF A MOUNTAIN PRECIPICE STROPHE Unperishing youth! Thou leapest from forth The cell of thy hidden nativity; Never mortal saw The cradle of the strong one; Never mortal heard The gathering of his voices; The deep-murmured charm of the son of the rock, That is lisp'd evermore at his slumberless fountain. There's a cloud at the portal, a spray-woven veil At the shrine of his ceaseless renewing; It embosoms the roses of dawn, It entangles the shafts of the noon, And into the bed of its stillness The moonshine sinks down as in slumber, That the son of the rock, that the nursling of heaven May be born in a holy twilight! ANTISTROPHE The wild goat in awe Looks up and beholds Above thee the cliff inaccessible;— Thou at once full-born Madd'nest in thy joyance, Whirlest, shatter'st, splitt'st, Life invulnerable. ?1799. TELL'S BIRTH-PLACE IMITATED FROM STOLBERG I Mark this holy chapel well! The birth-place, this, of William Tell. Here, where stands God's altar dread, Stood his parents' marriage-bed. II Here, first, an infant to her breast, Him his loving mother prest; And kissed the babe, and blessed the day, And prayed as mothers use to pray. III ‘Vouchsafe him health, O God! and give The child thy servant still to live!’ But God had destined to do more Through him, than through an arméd power. IV God gave him reverence of laws, Yet stirring blood in Freedom's cause— A spirit to his rocks akin, The eye of the hawk, and the fire therein! V To Nature and to Holy Writ Alone did God the boy commit: Where flashed and roared the torrent, oft His soul found wings, and soared aloft! VI The straining oar and chamois chase Had formed his limbs to strength and grace: On wave and wind the boy would toss, Was great, nor knew how great he was! VII He knew not that his chosen hand, Made strong by God, his native land Would rescue from the shameful yoke Of Slavery—the which he broke! ?1799. THE VISIT OF THE GODS IMITATED FROM SCHILLER Never, believe me, Appear the Immortals, Never alone: Scarce had I welcomed the Sorrow-beguiler, Iacchus! but in came Boy Cupid the Smiler; Lo! Phoebus the Glorious descends from his throne! They advance, they float in, the Olympians all! With Divinities fills my Terrestrial hall! How shall I yield you Due entertainment, Celestial quire? Me rather, bright guests! with your wings of upbuoyance Bear aloft to your homes, to your banquets of joyance, That the roofs of Olympus may echo my lyre! Hah! we mount! on their pinions they waft up my soul! O give me the nectar! O fill me the bowl! Give him the nectar! Pour out for the poet, Hebe! pour free! Quicken his eyes with celestial dew, That Styx the detested no more he may view, And like one of us Gods may conceit him to be! Thanks, Hebe! I quaff it! Io Paean, I cry! The wine of the Immortals Forbids me to die! ?1799. FROM THE GERMAN Know'st thou the land where the pale citrons grow, The golden fruits in darker foliage glow? Soft blows the wind that breathes from that blue sky! Still stands the myrtle and the laurel high! Know'st thou it well, that land, belovéd Friend? Thither with thee, O, thither would I wend! ?1799. WATER BALLAD [FROM THE FRENCH] ‘Come hither, gently rowing, Come, bear me quickly o'er This stream so brightly flowing To yonder woodland shore. But vain were my endeavour To pay thee, courteous guide; Row on, row on, for ever I'd have thee by my side. ‘Good boatman, prithee haste thee, I seek my father-land.’— ‘Say, when I there have placed thee, Dare I demand thy hand?’ ‘A maiden's head can never So hard a point decide; Row on, row on, for ever I'd have thee by my side.’ The happy bridal over The wanderer ceased to roam, For, seated by her lover, The boat became her home. And still they sang together As steering o'er the tide: ‘Row on through wind and weather For ever by my side.’ ?1799. ON AN INFANT WHICH DIED BEFORE BAPTISM ‘Be, rather than be called, a child of God,’ Death whispered! With assenting nod, Its head upon its mother's breast, The Baby bowed, without demur— Of the kingdom of the Blest Possessor, not Inheritor. April 8, 1799. SOMETHING CHILDISH, BUT VERY NATURAL WRITTEN IN GERMANY If I had but two little wings And were a little feathery bird, To you I'd fly, my dear! But thoughts like these are idle things, And I stay here. But in my sleep to you I fly: I'm always with you in my sleep! The world is all one's own. But then one wakes, and where am I? All, all alone. Sleep stays not, though a monarch bids: So I love to wake ere break of day: For though my sleep be gone, Yet while 'tis dark, one shuts one's lids, And still dreams on. April 23, 1799. HOME-SICK WRITTEN IN GERMANY 'Tis sweet to him who all the week Through city-crowds must push his way, To stroll alone through fields and woods, And hallow thus the Sabbath-day. And sweet it is, in summer bower, Sincere, affectionate and gay, One's own dear children feasting round, To celebrate one's marriage-day. But what is all to his delight, Who having long been doomed to roam, Throws off the bundle from his back, Before the door of his own home? Home-sickness is a wasting pang; This feel I hourly more and more: There's healing only in thy wings, Thou breeze that play'st on Albion's shore! May 6, 1799. LINES WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM AT ELBINGERODE, IN THE HARTZ FOREST I stood on Brocken's sovran height, and saw Woods crowding upon woods, hills over hills, A surging scene, and only limited By the blue distance. Heavily my way Downward I dragged through fir groves evermore, Where bright green moss heaves in sepulchral forms Speckled with sunshine; and, but seldom heard, The sweet bird's song became a hollow sound; And the breeze, murmuring indivisibly, Preserved its solemn murmur most distinct From many a note of many a waterfall, And the brook's chatter; 'mid whose islet-stones The dingy kidling with its tinkling bell Leaped frolicsome, or old romantic goat Sat, his white beard slow waving. I moved on In low and languid mood: for I had found That outward forms, the loftiest, still receive Their finer influence from the Life within;— Fair cyphers else: fair, but of import vague Or unconcerning, where the heart not finds History or prophecy of friend, or child, Or gentle maid, our first and early love, Or father, or the venerable name Of our adoréd country! O thou Queen, Thou delegated Deity of Earth, O dear, dear England! how my longing eye Turned westward, shaping in the steady clouds Thy sands and high white cliffs! My native Land! Filled with the thought of thee this heart was proud, Yea, mine eye swam with tears: that all the view From sovran Brocken, woods and woody hills, Floated away, like a departing dream, Feeble and dim! Stranger, these impulses Blame thou not lightly; nor will I profane, With hasty judgment or injurious doubt, That man's sublimer spirit, who can feel That God is everywhere! the God who framed Mankind to be one mighty family, Himself our Father, and the World our Home. May 17, 1799. THE BRITISH STRIPLING'S WAR-SONG IMITATED FROM STOLBERG Yes, noble old Warrior! this heart has beat high, Since you told of the deeds which our countrymen wrought; O lend me the sabre that hung by thy thigh, And I too will fight as my forefathers fought. Despise not my youth, for my spirit is steel'd, And I know there is strength in the grasp of my hand; Yea, as firm as thyself would I march to the field, And as proudly would die for my dear native land. In the sports of my childhood I mimick'd the fight, The sound of a trumpet suspended my breath; And my fancy still wander'd by day and by night, Amid battle and tumult, 'mid conquest and death. My own shout of onset, when the Armies advance, How oft it awakes me from visions of glory; When I meant to have leapt on the Hero of France, And have dash'd him to earth, pale and breathless and gory. As late thro' the city with banners all streaming To the music of trumpets the Warriors flew by, With helmet and scimitars naked and gleaming, On their proud-trampling, thunder-hoof'd steeds did they fly; I sped to yon heath that is lonely and bare, For each nerve was unquiet, each pulse in alarm; And I hurl'd the mock-lance thro' the objectless air, And in open-eyed dream proved the strength of my arm. Yes, noble old Warrior! this heart has beat high, Since you told of the deeds that our countrymen wrought; O lend me the sabre that hung by thy thigh, And I too will fight as my forefathers fought! ?1799. NAMES [FROM LESSING] I ask'd my fair one happy day, What I should call her in my lay; By what sweet name from Rome or Greece; Lalage, Neaera, Chloris, Sappho, Lesbia, or Doris, Arethusa or Lucrece. ‘Ah!’ replied my gentle fair, ‘Belovéd, what are names but air? Choose thou whatever suits the line; Call me Sappho, call me Chloris, Call me Lalage or Doris, Only, only call me Thine.’ 1799. THE DEVIL'S THOUGHTS I From his brimstone bed at break of day A walking the Devil is gone, To visit his snug little farm the earth, And see how his stock goes on. II Over the hill and over the dale, And he went over the plain, And backward and forward he switched his long tail As a gentleman switches his cane. III And how then was the Devil drest? Oh! he was in his Sunday's best: His jacket was red and his breeches were blue, And there was a hole where the tail came through. IV He saw a Lawyer killing a Viper On a dunghill hard by his own stable; And the Devil smiled, for it put him in mind Of Cain and his brother, Abel. V He saw an Apothecary on a white horse Ride by on his vocations, And the Devil thought of his old Friend Death in the Revelations. VI He saw a cottage with a double coach-house, A cottage of gentility; And the Devil did grin, for his darling sin Is pride that apes humility. VII He peep'd into a rich bookseller's shop, Quoth he! we are both of one college! For I sate myself, like a cormorant, once Hard by the tree of knowledge. VIII Down the river did glide, with wind and tide, A pig with vast celerity; And the Devil look'd wise as he saw how the while, It cut its own throat. ‘There!’ quoth he with a smile, ‘Goes “England's commercial prosperity.”’ IX As he went through Cold-Bath Fields he saw A solitary cell; And the Devil was pleased, for it gave him a hint For improving his prisons in Hell. X He saw a Turnkey in a trice Fetter a troublesome blade; ‘Nimbly,’ quoth he, ‘do the fingers move If a man be but used to his trade.’ XI He saw the same Turnkey unfetter a man, With but little expedition, Which put him in mind of the long debate On the Slave-trade abolition. XII He saw an old acquaintance As he passed by a Methodist meeting;— She holds a consecrated key, And the devil nods her a greeting. XIII She turned up her nose, and said, ‘Avaunt! my name's Religion,’ And she looked to Mr.— And leered like a love-sick pigeon. XIV He saw a certain minister (A minister to his mind) Go up into a certain House, With a majority behind. XV The Devil quoted Genesis Like a very learnéd clerk, How ‘Noah and his creeping things Went up into the Ark.’ XVI He took from the poor, And he gave to the rich, And he shook hands with a Scotchman, For he was not afraid of the— XVII General ? burning face He saw with consternation, And back to hell his way did he take, For the Devil thought by a slight mistake It was general conflagration. 1799. LINES COMPOSED IN A CONCERT-ROOM Nor cold, nor stern, my soul! yet I detest These scented Rooms, where, to a gaudy throng, Heaves the proud Harlot her distended breast, In intricacies of laborious song. These feel not Music's genuine power, nor deign To melt at Nature's passion-warbled plaint; But when the long-breathed singer's uptrilled strain Bursts in a squall—they gape for wonderment. Hark! the deep buzz of Vanity and Hate! Scornful, yet envious, with self-torturing sneer My lady eyes some maid of humbler state, While the pert Captain, or the primmer Priest, Prattles accordant scandal in her ear. O give me, from this heartless scene released, To hear our old Musician, blind and grey, (Whom stretching from my nurse's arms I kissed,) His Scottish tunes and warlike marches play, By moonshine, on the balmy summer-night, The while I dance amid the tedded hay With merry maids, whose ringlets toss in light. Or lies the purple evening on the bay Of the calm glossy lake, O let me hide Unheard, unseen, behind the alder-trees, For round their roots the fisher's boat is tied, On whose trim seat doth Edmund stretch at ease, And while the lazy boat sways to and fro, Breathes in his flute sad airs, so wild and slow, That his own cheek is wet with quiet tears. But O, dear Anne! when midnight wind careers, And the gust pelting on the out-house shed Makes the cock shrilly in the rainstorm crow, To hear thee sing some ballad full of woe, Ballad of ship-wreck'd sailor floating dead, Whom his own true-love buried in the sands! Thee, gentle woman, for thy voice remeasures Whatever tones and melancholy pleasures The things of Nature utter; birds or trees, Or moan of ocean-gale in weedy caves, Or where the stiff grass mid the heath-plant waves, Murmur and music thin of sudden breeze. 1799. WESTPHALIAN SONG [The following is an almost literal translation of a very old and very favourite song among the Westphalian Boors. The turn at the end is the same with one of Mr. Dibdin's excellent songs, and the air to which it is sung by the Boors is remarkably sweet and lively.] When thou to my true-love com'st Greet her from me kindly; When she asks thee how I fare? Say, folks in Heaven fare finely. When she asks, ‘What! Is he sick?’ Say, dead!—and when for sorrow She begins to sob and cry, Say, I come to-morrow. ?1799. HEXAMETERS PARAPHRASE OF PSALM XLVI G?d ?s o?r Str?ngth ?nd o?r R?f?ge: th?ref?re w?ll w? n?t tr?mbl?, Th?' th? E?rth b? r?m?v?d ?nd th?' th? p?rp?t??l Mo?nta?ns Sink in the Swell of the Ocean! God is our Strength and our Refuge. There is a River the Flowing whereof shall gladden the City, Hallelujah! the City of God! Jehova shall help her. Th? Id?l?t?rs r?g?d, the kingdoms were moving in fury; But he uttered his Voice: Earth melted away from beneath them. Halleluja! th' Eternal is with us, Almighty Jehova! Fearful the works of the Lord, yea fearful his Desolations; But He maketh the Battle to cease, he burneth the Spear and the Chariot. Halleluja! th' Eternal is with us, the God of our Fathers! 1799. HYMN TO THE EARTH HEXAMETERS [IMITATED FROM STOLBERG'S HYMNE AN DIE ERDE] Earth! thou mother of numberless children, the nurse and the mother, Hail! O Goddess, thrice hail! Blest be thou! and, blessing, I hymn thee! Forth, ye sweet sounds! from my harp, and my voice shall float on your surges— Soar thou aloft, O my soul! and bear up my song on thy pinions. Travelling the vale with mine eyes—green meadows and lake with green island, Dark in its basin of rock, and the bare stream flowing in brightness, Thrilled with thy beauty and love in the wooded slope of the mountain, Here, great mother, I lie, thy child, with his head on thy bosom! Playful the spirits of noon, that rushing soft through thy tresses, Green-haired goddess! refresh me; and hark! as they hurry or linger, Fill the pause of my harp, or sustain it with musical murmurs. Into my being thou murmurest joy, and tenderest sadness Shedd'st thou, like dew, on my heart, till the joy and the heavenly sadness Pour themselves forth from my heart in tears, and the hymn of thanksgiving. Earth! thou mother of numberless children, the nurse and the mother, Sister thou of the stars, and beloved by the Sun, the rejoicer! Guardian and friend of the moon, O Earth, whom the comets forget not, Yea, in the measureless distance wheel round and again they behold thee! Fadeless and young (and what if the latest birth of creation?) Bride and consort of Heaven, that looks down upon thee enamoured! Say, mysterious Earth! O say, great mother and goddess, Was it not well with thee then, when first thy lap was ungirdled, Thy lap to the genial Heaven, the day that he wooed thee and won thee! Fair was thy blush, the fairest and first of the blushes of morning! Deep was the shudder, O Earth the throe of thy self-retention: Inly thou strovest to flee, and didst seek thyself at thy centre! Mightier far was the joy of thy sudden resilience; and forth-with Myriad myriads of lives teemed forth from the mighty embracement. Thousand-fold tribes of dwellers, impelled by thousand-fold instincts, Filled, as a dream, the wide waters; the rivers sang on their channels; Laughed on their shores the hoarse seas; the yearning ocean swelled upward; Young life lowed through the meadows, the woods, and the echoing mountains, Wandered bleating in valleys, and warbled on blossoming branches. 1799. MAHOMET Utter the song, O my soul! the flight and return of Mohammed, Prophet and priest, who scatter'd abroad both evil and blessing, Huge wasteful empires founded and hallow'd slow persecution, Soul-withering, but crush'd the blasphemous rites of the Pagan And idolatrous Christians.—For veiling the Gospel of Jesus, They, the best corrupting, had made it worse than the vilest. Wherefore Heaven decreed th' enthusiast warrior of Mecca, Choosing good from iniquity rather than evil from goodness. Loud the tumult in Mecca surrounding the fane of the idol;— Naked and prostrate the priesthood were laid—the people with mad shouts Thundering now, and now with saddest ululation Flew, as over the channel of rock-stone the ruinous river Shatters its waters abreast, and in mazy uproar bewilder'd, Rushes dividuous all—all rushing impetuous onward. ?1799. LOVE All thoughts, all passions, all delights, Whatever stirs this mortal frame, All are but ministers of Love, And feed his sacred flame. Oft in my waking dreams do I Live o'er again that happy hour, When midway on the mount I lay, Beside the ruined tower. The moonshine, stealing o'er the scene Had blended with the lights of eve; And she was there, my hope, my joy, My own dear Genevieve! She leant against the arméd man, The statue of the arméd knight; She stood and listened to my lay, Amid the lingering light. Few sorrows hath she of her own, My hope! my joy! my Genevieve! She loves me best, whene'er I sing The songs that make her grieve. I played a soft and doleful air, I sang an old and moving story— An old rude song, that suited well That ruin wild and hoary. She listened with a flitting blush, With downcast eyes and modest grace; For well she knew, I could not choose But gaze upon her face. I told her of the Knight that wore Upon his shield a burning brand; And that for ten long years he wooed The Lady of the Land. I told her how he pined: and ah! The deep, the low, the pleading tone With which I sang another's love, Interpreted my own. She listened with a flitting blush, With downcast eyes, and modest grace; And she forgave me, that I gazed Too fondly on her face! But when I told the cruel scorn That crazed that bold and lovely Knight, And that he crossed the mountain-woods, Nor rested day nor night; That sometimes from the savage den, And sometimes from the darksome shade, And sometimes starting up at once In green and sunny glade,— There came and looked him in the face An angel beautiful and bright; And that he knew it was a Fiend, This miserable Knight! And that unknowing what he did, He leaped amid a murderous band, And saved from outrage worse than death The Lady of the Land! And how she wept, and clasped his knees; And how she tended him in vain— And ever strove to expiate The scorn that crazed his brain;— And that she nursed him in a cave; And how his madness went away, When on the yellow forest-leaves A dying man he lay;— His dying words—but when I reached That tenderest strain of all the ditty, My faultering voice and pausing harp Disturbed her soul with pity! All impulses of soul and sense Had thrilled my guileless Genevieve; The music and the doleful tale, The rich and balmy eve; And hopes, and fears that kindle hope, An undistinguishable throng, And gentle wishes long subdued, Subdued and cherished long! She wept with pity and delight, She blushed with love, and virgin-shame; And like the murmur of a dream, I heard her breathe my name. Her bosom heaved—she stepped aside, As conscious of my look she stepped— Then suddenly, with timorous eye She fled to me and wept. She half enclosed me with her arms, She pressed me with a meek embrace; And bending back her head, looked up, And gazed upon my face. 'Twas partly love, and partly fear, And partly 'twas a bashful art, That I might rather feel, than see, The swelling of her heart. I calmed her fears, and she was calm, And told her love with virgin pride; And so I won my Genevieve, My bright and beauteous Bride. 1799. ODE TO GEORGIANA, DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE ON THE TWENTY-FOURTH STANZA IN HER ‘PASSAGE OVER MOUNT GOTHARD’ And hail the Chapel! hail the Platform wild! Where Tell directed the avenging dart, With well-strung arm, that first preservst his child, Then aim'd the arrow at the tyrant's heart. Splendour's fondly-fostered child! And did you hail the platform wild, Where once the Austrian fell Beneath the shaft of Tell! O Lady, nursed in pomp and pleasure! Whence learn'd you that heroic measure? Light as a dream your days their circlets ran, From all that teaches brotherhood to Man Far, far removed! from want, from hope, from fear! Enchanting music lulled your infant ear, Obeisance, praises soothed your infant heart: Emblazonments and old ancestral crests, With many a bright obtrusive form of art, Detained your eye from Nature: stately vests, That veiling strove to deck your charms divine, Rich viands, and the pleasurable wine, Were yours unearned by toil; nor could you see The unenjoying toiler's misery. And yet, free Nature's uncorrupted child, You hailed the Chapel and the Platform wild, Where once the Austrian fell Beneath the shaft of Tell! O Lady, nursed in pomp and pleasure! Whence learn'd you that heroic measure? There crowd your finely-fibred frame All living faculties of bliss; And Genius to your cradle came, His forehead wreathed with lambent flame, And bending low, with godlike kiss Breath'd in a more celestial life; But boasts not many a fair compeer A heart as sensitive to joy and fear? And some, perchance, might wage an equal strife, Some few, to nobler being wrought, Corrivals in the nobler gift of thought. Yet these delight to celebrate Laurelled War and plumy State; Or in verse and music dress Tales of rustic happiness— Pernicious tales! insidious strains! That steel the rich man's breast, And mock the lot unblest, The sordid vices and the abject pains, Which evermore must be The doom of ignorance and penury! But you, free Nature's uncorrupted child, You hailed the Chapel and the Platform wild, Where once the Austrian fell Beneath the shaft of Tell! O Lady, nursed in pomp and pleasure! Whence learn'd you that heroic measure? You were a Mother! That most holy name, Which Heaven and Nature bless, I may not vilely prostitute to those Whose infants owe them less Than the poor caterpillar owes Its gaudy parent fly. You were a mother! at your bosom fed The babes that loved you. You, with laughing eye, Each twilight-thought, each nascent feeling read, Which you yourself created. Oh! delight! A second time to be a mother, Without the mother's bitter groans: Another thought, and yet another, By touch, or taste, by looks or tones, O'er the growing sense to roll, The mother of your infant's soul! The Angel of the Earth, who, while he guides His chariot-planet round the goal of day, All trembling gazes on the eye of God A moment turned his awful face away; And as he viewed you, from his aspect sweet New influences in your being rose, Blest intuitions and communions fleet With living Nature, in her joys and woes! Thenceforth your soul rejoiced to see The shrine of social Liberty! O beautiful! O Nature's child! 'Twas thence you hailed the Platform wild, Where once the Austrian fell Beneath the shaft of Tell! O Lady, nursed in pomp and pleasure! Thence learn'd you that heroic measure. 1799. A CHRISTMAS CAROL I The shepherds went their hasty way, And found the lowly stable-shed Where the Virgin-Mother lay: And now they checked their eager tread, For to the Babe, that at her bosom clung, A Mother's song the Virgin-Mother sung. II They told her how a glorious light, Streaming from a heavenly throng, Around them shone, suspending night! While sweeter than a mother's song, Blest Angels heralded the Saviour's birth, Glory to God on high! and Peace on Earth. III She listened to the tale divine, And closer still the Babe she pressed; And while she cried, the Babe is mine! The milk rushed faster to her breast: Joy rose within her, like a summer's morn; Peace, Peace on Earth! the Prince of Peace is born. IV Thou Mother of the Prince of Peace, Poor, simple, and of low estate! That strife should vanish, battle cease, O why should this thy soul elate? Sweet Music's loudest note, the Poet's story,— Didst thou ne'er love to hear of fame and glory? V And is not War a youthful king, A stately Hero clad in mail? Beneath his footsteps laurels spring; Him Earth's majestic monarchs hail Their friend, their playmate! and his bold bright eye Compels the maiden's love-confessing sigh. VI ‘Tell this in some more courtly scene, To maids and youths in robes of state! I am a woman poor and mean, And therefore is my soul elate. War is a ruffian, all with guilt defiled, That from the agéd father tears his child! VII ‘A murderous fiend, by fiends adored, He kills the sire and starves the son; The husband kills, and from her board Steals all his widow's toil had won; Plunders God's world of beauty; rends away All safety from the night, all comfort from the day. VIII ‘Then wisely is my soul elate, That strife should vanish, battle cease: I'm poor and of a low estate, The Mother of the Prince of Peace. Joy rises in me, like a summer's morn: Peace, Peace on Earth! the Prince of Peace is born.’ 1799. TALLEYRAND TO LORD GRENVILLE A METRICAL EPISTLE [As printed in Morning Post for January 10, 1800. Preceded by the following letter]: To the Editor of The Morning Post. Mr. Editor,—An unmetrical letter from Talleyrand to Lord Grenville has already appeared, and from an authority too high to be questioned: otherwise I could adduce some arguments for the exclusive authenticity of the following metrical epistle. The very epithet which the wise ancients used, ‘aurea carmina,’ might have been supposed likely to have determined the choice of the French minister in favour of verse; and the rather when we recollect that this phrase of ‘golden verses’ is applied emphatically to the works of that philosopher who imposed silence on all with whom he had to deal. Besides is it not somewhat improbable that Talleyrand should have preferred prose to rhyme, when the latter alone has got the chink? Is it not likewise curious that in our official answer no notice whatever is taken of the Chief Consul, Bonaparte, as if there had been no such person [man Essays, &amp;c., 1850] existing; notwithstanding that his existence is pretty generally admitted, nay that some have been so rash as to believe that he has created as great a sensation in the world as Lord Grenville, or even the Duke of Portland? But the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Talleyrand, is acknowledged, which, in our opinion, could not have happened had he written only that insignificant prose-letter, which seems to precede Bonaparte's, as in old romances a dwarf always ran before to proclaim the advent or arrival of knight or giant. That Talleyrand's character and practices more resemble those of some regular Governments than Bonaparte's I admit; but this of itself does not appear a satisfactory explanation. However, let the letter speak for itself. The second line is supererogative in syllables, whether from the oscitancy of the transcriber, or from the trepidation which might have overpowered the modest Frenchman, on finding himself in the act of writing to so great a man, I shall not dare to determine. A few Notes are added by Your servant, Gnome. P.S.—As mottoes are now fashionable, especially if taken from out of the way books, you may prefix, if you please, the following lines from Sidonius Apollinaris: ‘Saxa, et robora, corneasque fibras Mollit dulciloquâ canorus arte!’ TALLEYRAND, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AT PARIS, TO LORD GRENVILLE, SECRETARY OF STATE IN GREAT BRITAIN FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, AUDITOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, A LORD OF TRADE, AN ELDER BROTHER OF TRINITY HOUSE, ETC. My Lord! though your Lordship repel deviation From forms long establish'd, yet with high consideration, I plead for the honour to hope that no blame Will attach, should this letter begin with my name. I dar'd not presume on your Lordship to bounce, But thought it more exquisite first to announce! My Lord! I've the honour to be Talleyrand, And the letter's from me! you'll not draw back your hand Nor yet take it up by the rim in dismay, As boys pick up ha'pence on April fool-day. I'm no Jacobin foul, or red-hot Cordelier That your Lordship's ungauntleted fingers need fear An infection or burn! Believe me, 'tis true, With a scorn like another I look down on the crew That bawl and hold up to the mob's detestation The most delicate wish for a silent persuasion. A form long-establish'd these Terrorists call Bribes, perjury, theft, and the devil and all! And yet spite of all that the Moralist prates, 'Tis the keystone and cement of civilized States. Those American Reps! And i' faith, they were serious! It shock'd us at Paris, like something mysterious, That men who've a Congress—But no more of 't! I'm proud To have stood so distinct from the Jacobin crowd. My Lord! though the vulgar in wonder be lost at My transfigurations, and name me Apostate, Such a meaningless nickname, which never incens'd me, Cannot prejudice you or your Cousin against me: I'm Ex-bishop. What then? Burke himself would agree That I left not the Church—'twas the Church that left me. My titles prelatic I lov'd and retain'd, As long as what I meant by Prelate remain'd: And tho' Mitres no longer will pass in our mart, I'm episcopal still to the core of my heart. No time from my name this my motto shall sever: 'Twill be Non sine pulvere palma for ever! Your goodness, my Lord, I conceive as excessive, Or I dar'd not present you a scroll so digressive; And in truth with my pen thro' and thro' I should strike it; But I hear that your Lordship's own style is just like it. Dear my Lord, we are right: for what charms can be shew'd In a thing that goes straight like an old Roman road? The tortoise crawls straight, the hare doubles about; And the true line of beauty still winds in and out. It argues, my Lord! of fine thoughts such a brood in us To split and divide into heads multitudinous, While charms that surprise (it can ne'er be denied us) Sprout forth from each head, like the ears from King Midas. Were a genius of rank, like a commonplace dunce, Compell'd to drive on to the main point at once, What a plentiful vintage of initiations Would Noble Lords lose in your Lordship's orations. My fancy transports me! As mute as a mouse, And as fleet as a pigeon, I'm borne to the house Where all those who are Lords, from father to son, Discuss the affairs of all those who are none. I behold you, my Lord! of your feelings quite full, 'Fore the woolsack arise, like a sack full of wool! You rise on each Anti-Grenvillian Member, Short, thick and blustrous, like a day in November! Short in person, I mean: for the length of your speeches Fame herself, that most famous reporter, ne'er reaches. Lo! Patience beholds you contemn her brief reign, And Time, that all-panting toil'd after in vain, (Like the Beldam who raced for a smock with her grandchild) Drops and cries: ‘Were such lungs e'er assign'd to a manchild?’ Your strokes at her vitals pale Truth has confess'd, And Zeal unresisted entempests your breast! Though some noble Lords may be wishing to sup, Your merit self-conscious, my Lord, keeps you up, Unextinguish'd and swoln, as a balloon of paper Keeps aloft by the smoke of its own farthing taper. Ye sixteens of Scotland, your snuffs ye must trim; Your Geminies, fix'd stars of England! grow dim, And but for a form long-establish'd, no doubt Twinkling faster and faster, ye all would go out. Apropos, my dear Lord! a ridiculous blunder Of some of our Journalists caused us some wonder: It was said that in aspect malignant and sinister In the Isle of Great Britain a great Foreign Minister Turn'd as pale as a journeyman miller's frock coat is On observing a star that appear'd in Bootes! When the whole truth was this (O those ignorant brutes!) Your Lordship had made his appearance in boots. You, my Lord, with your star, sat in boots, and the Spanish Ambassador thereupon thought fit to vanish. But perhaps, dear my Lord, among other worse crimes, The whole was no more than a lie of The Times. It is monstrous, my Lord! in a civilis'd state That such Newspaper rogues should have license to prate. Indeed printing in general—but for the taxes, Is in theory false and pernicious in praxis! You and I, and your Cousin, and Abbé Sieyes, And all the great Statesmen that live in these days, Are agreed that no nation secure is from vi'lence Unless all who must think are maintain'd all in silence. This printing, my Lord—but 'tis useless to mention What we both of us think—'twas a curséd invention, And Germany might have been honestly prouder Had she left it alone, and found out only powder. My Lord! when I think of our labours and cares Who rule the Department of foreign affairs, And how with their libels these journalists bore us, Though Rage I acknowledge than Scorn less decorous; Yet their presses and types I could shiver in splinters, Those Printers' black Devils! those Devils of Printers! In case of a peace—but perhaps it were better To proceed to the absolute point of my letter: For the deep wounds of France, Bonaparte, my master, Has found out a new sort of basilicon plaister. But your time, my dear Lord! is your nation's best treasure, I've intruded already too long on your leisure; If so, I entreat you with penitent sorrow To pause, and resume the remainder to-morrow. 1800. APOLOGIA PRO VITA SUA The poet in his lone yet genial hour Gives to his eyes a magnifying power: Or rather he emancipates his eyes From the black shapeless accidents of size— In unctuous cones of kindling coal, Or smoke upwreathing from the pipe's trim bole, His gifted ken can see Phantoms of sublimity. 1800. THE KEEPSAKE The tedded hay, the first fruits of the soil, The tedded hay and corn-sheaves in one field, Show summer gone, ere come. The foxglove tall Sheds its loose purple bells, or in the gust, Or when it bends beneath the up-springing lark, Or mountain-finch alighting. And the rose (In vain the darling of successful love) Stands, like some boasted beauty of past years, The thorns remaining, and the flowers all gone. Nor can I find, amid my lonely walk By rivulet, or spring, or wet roadside, That blue and bright-eyed floweret of the brook, Hope's gentle gem, the sweet Forget-me-not! So will not fade the flowers which Emmeline With delicate fingers on the snow-white silk Has worked (the flowers which most she knew I loved), And, more beloved than they, her auburn hair. In the cool morning twilight, early waked By her full bosom's joyous restlessness, Softly she rose, and lightly stole along, Down the slope coppice to the woodbine bower, Whose rich flowers, swinging in the morning breeze, Over their dim fast-moving shadows hung, Making a quiet image of disquiet In the smooth, scarcely moving river-pool. There, in that bower where first she owned her love, And let me kiss my own warm tear of joy From off her glowing cheek, she sate and stretched The silk upon the frame, and worked her name Between the Moss-Rose and Forget-me-not— Her own dear name, with her own auburn hair! That forced to wander till sweet spring return, I yet might ne'er forget her smile, her look, Her voice, (that even in her mirthful mood Has made me wish to steal away and weep,) Nor yet the entrancement of that maiden kiss With which she promised, that when spring returned, She would resign one half of that dear name, And own thenceforth no other name but mine! ?1800. A THOUGHT SUGGESTED BY A VIEW OF SADDLEBACK IN CUMBERLAND On stern Blencartha's perilous height The winds are tyrannous and strong; And flashing forth unsteady light From stern Blencartha's skiey height, As loud the torrents throng! Beneath the moon, in gentle weather, They bind the earth and sky together. But oh! the sky and all its forms, how quiet! The things that seek the earth, how full of noise and riot! 1800. THE MAD MONK I heard a voice from Etna's side; Where o'er a cavern's mouth That fronted to the south A chesnut spread its umbrage wide: A hermit or a monk the man might be; But him I could not see: And thus the music flow'd along, In melody most like to old Sicilian song: ‘There was a time when earth, and sea, and skies, The bright green vale, and forest's dark recess, With all things, lay before mine eyes In steady loveliness: But now I feel, on earth's uneasy scene, Such sorrows as will never cease;— I only ask for peace; If I must live to know that such a time has been!’ A silence then ensued: Till from the cavern came A voice;—it was the same! And thus, in mournful tone, its dreary plaint renew'd: ‘Last night, as o'er the sloping turf I trod, The smooth green turf, to me a vision gave Beneath mine eyes, the sod— The roof of Rosa's grave! My heart has need with dreams like these to strive, For, when I woke, beneath mine eyes I found The plot of mossy ground, On which we oft have sat when Rosa was alive.— Why must the rock, and margin of the flood, Why must the hills so many flow'rets bear, Whose colours to a murder'd maiden's blood, Such sad resemblance wear?— ‘I struck the wound,—this hand of mine! For Oh, thou maid divine, I lov'd to agony! The youth whom thou call'd'st thine Did never love like me! ‘Is it the stormy clouds above That flash'd so red a gleam? On yonder downward trickling stream?— 'Tis not the blood of her I love.— The sun torments me from his western bed, Oh, let him cease for ever to diffuse Those crimson spectre hues! Oh, let me lie in peace, and be for ever dead!’ Here ceas'd the voice. In deep dismay, Down thro' the forest I pursu'd my way. 1800. INSCRIPTION FOR A SEAT BY THE ROAD SIDE HALF-WAY UP A STEEP HILL FACING SOUTH Thou who in youthful vigour rich, and light With youthful thoughts dost need no rest! O thou, To whom alike the valley and the hill Present a path of ease! Should e'er thine eye Glance on this sod, and this rude tablet, stop! 'Tis a rude spot, yet here, with thankful hearts, The foot-worn soldier and his family Have rested, wife and babe, and boy, perchance Some eight years old or less, and scantly fed, Garbed like his father, and already bound To his poor father's trade. Or think of him Who, laden with his implements of toil, Returns at night to some far distant home, And having plodded on through rain and mire With limbs o'erlaboured, weak from feverish heat, And chafed and fretted by December blasts, Here pauses, thankful he hath reached so far, And 'mid the sheltering warmth of these bleak trees Finds restoration—or reflect on those Who in the spring to meet the warmer sun Crawl up this steep hill-side, that needlessly Bends double their weak frames, already bowed By age or malady, and when, at last, They gain this wished-for turf, this seat of sods, Repose—and, well-admonished, ponder here On final rest. And if a serious thought Should come uncalled—how soon thy motions high, Thy balmy spirits and thy fervid blood Must change to feeble, withered, cold and dry, Cherish the wholesome sadness! And where'er The tide of Life impel thee, O be prompt To make thy present strength the staff of all, Their staff and resting-place—so shalt thou give To Youth the sweetest joy that Youth can know; And for thy future self thou shalt provide Through every change of various life, a seat, Not built by hands, on which thy inner part, Imperishable, many a grievous hour, Or bleak or sultry may repose—yea, sleep The sleep of Death, and dream of blissful worlds, Then wake in Heaven, and find the dream all true. 1800. A STRANGER MINSTREL WRITTEN [TO MRS. ROBINSON,] A FEW WEEKS BEFORE HER DEATH As late on Skiddaw's mount I lay supine, Midway th' ascent, in that repose divine When the soul centred in the heart's recess Hath quaff'd its fill of Nature's loveliness, Yet still beside the fountain's marge will stay And fain would thirst again, again to quaff; Then when the tear, slow travelling on its way, Fills up the wrinkles of a silent laugh— In that sweet mood of sad and humorous thought A form within me rose, within me wrought With such strong magic, that I cried aloud, ‘Thou ancient Skiddaw by thy helm of cloud, And by thy many-colour'd chasms deep, And by their shadows that for ever sleep, By yon small flaky mists that love to creep Along the edges of those spots of light, Those sunny islands on thy smooth green height, And by yon shepherds with their sheep, And dogs and boys, a gladsome crowd, That rush e'en now with clamour loud Sudden from forth thy topmost cloud, And by this laugh, and by this tear, I would, old Skiddaw, she were here! A lady of sweet song is she, Her soft blue eye was made for thee! O ancient Skiddaw, by this tear, I would, I would that she were here!’ Then ancient Skiddaw, stern and proud, In sullen majesty replying, Thus spake from out his helm of cloud (His voice was like an echo dying!):— ‘She dwells belike in scenes more fair, And scorns a mount so bleak and bare.’ I only sigh'd when this I heard, Such mournful thoughts within me stirr'd That all my heart was faint and weak, So sorely was I troubled! No laughter wrinkled on my cheek, But O the tears were doubled! But ancient Skiddaw green and high Heard and understood my sigh; And now, in tones less stern and rude, As if he wish'd to end the feud, Spake he, the proud response renewing (His voice was like a monarch wooing):— ‘Nay, but thou dost not know her might, The pinions of her soul how strong! But many a stranger in my height Hath sung to me her magic song, Sending forth his ecstasy In her divinest melody, And hence I know her soul is free, She is where'er she wills to be, Unfetter'd by mortality! Now to the “haunted beach” can fly, Beside the threshold scourged with waves, Now where the maniac wildly raves, “Pale moon, thou spectre of the sky!” No wind that hurries o'er my height Can travel with so swift a flight. I too, methinks, might merit The presence of her spirit! To me too might belong The honour of her song and witching melody, Which most resembles me, Soft, various, and sublime, Exempt from wrongs of Time!’ Thus spake the mighty Mount, and I Made answer, with a deep-drawn sigh:— ‘Thou ancient Skiddaw, by this tear, I would, I would that she were here!’ November, 1800. ALCAEUS TO SAPPHO How sweet, when crimson colours dart Across a breast of snow, To see that you are in the heart That beats and throbs below. All Heaven is in a maiden's blush, In which the soul doth speak, That it was you who sent the flush Into the maiden's cheek. Large steadfast eyes! eyes gently rolled In shades of changing blue, How sweet are they, if they behold No dearer sight than you. And, can a lip more richly glow, Or be more fair than this? The world will surely answer, No! I, Sappho, answer, Yes! Then grant one smile, tho' it should mean A thing of doubtful birth; That I may say these eyes have seen The fairest face on earth! 1800. THE TWO ROUND SPACES ON THE TOMBSTONE The Devil believes that the Lord will come, Stealing a march without beat of drum, About the same time that he came last, On an Old Christmas-day in a snowy blast: Till he bids the trump sound neither body nor soul stirs, For the dead men's heads have slipt under their bolsters. Oh! ho! brother Bard, in our churchyard, Both beds and bolsters are soft and green; Save one alone, and that's of stone, And under it lies a Counsellor keen. 'Twould be a square tomb, if it were not too long; And 'tis fenced round with irons sharp, spear-like, and strong. This fellow from Aberdeen hither did skip With a waxy face and a blubber lip, And a black tooth in front, to show in part What was the colour of his whole heart. This Counsellor sweet, This Scotchman complete, (The Devil scotch him for a snake!) I trust he lies in his grave awake. On the sixth of January, When all around is white with snow, As a Cheshire yeoman's dairy, Brother Bard, ho! ho! believe it, or no, On that stone tomb to you I'll show Two round spaces void of snow. I swear by our Knight, and his forefathers' souls, That in size and shape they are just like the holes In the house of privity Of that ancient family. On those two places void of snow, There have sat in the night for an hour or so, Before sunrise, and after cock-crow, He kicking his heels, she cursing her corns, All to the tune of the wind in their horns, The Devil and his Grannam, With a snow-blast to fan 'em; Expecting and hoping the trumpet to blow, For they are cock-sure of the fellow below! 1800. THE SNOW-DROP 1 Fear no more, thou timid Flower! Fear thou no more the winter's might, The whelming thaw, the ponderous shower, The silence of the freezing night! Since Laura murmur'd o'er thy leaves The potent sorceries of song, To thee, meek Flowret! gentler gales And cloudless skies belong. 2 Her eye with tearful meanings fraught, She gaz'd till all the body mov'd Interpreting the Spirit's thought— The Spirit's eager sympathy Now trembled with thy trembling stem, And while thou droopedst o'er thy bed, With sweet unconscious sympathy Inclin'd the drooping head. 3 She droop'd her head, she stretch'd her arm, She whisper'd low her witching rhymes, Fame unreluctant heard the charm, And bore thee to Pierian climes! Fear thou no more the Matin Frost That sparkled on thy bed of snow; For there, mid laurels ever green, Immortal thou shalt blow. 4 Thy petals boast a white more soft, The spell hath so perfuméd thee, That careless Love shall deem thee oft A blossom from his Myrtle tree. Then, laughing at the fair deceit, Shall race with some Etesian wind To seek the woven arboret Where Laura lies reclin'd. 5 All them whom Love and Fancy grace, When grosser eyes are clos'd in sleep, The gentle spirits of the place Waft up the insuperable steep, On whose vast summit broad and smooth Her nest the Phœnix Bird conceals, And where by cypresses o'erhung The heavenly Lethe steals. 6 A sea-like sound the branches breathe, Stirr'd by the Breeze that loiters there; And all that stretch their limbs beneath, Forget the coil of mortal care. Strange mists along the margins rise, To heal the guests who thither come, And fit the soul to re-endure Its earthly martyrdom. 7 The margin dear to moonlight elves Where Zephyr-trembling Lilies grow, And bend to kiss their softer selves That tremble in the stream below:— There nightly borne does Laura lie A magic Slumber heaves her breast: Her arm, white wanderer of the Harp, Beneath her cheek is prest. 8 The Harp uphung by golden chains Of that low wind which whispers round, With coy reproachfulness complains, In snatches of reluctant sound: The music hovers half-perceiv'd, And only moulds the slumberer's dreams; Remember'd Loves relume her cheek With Youth's returning gleams. 1800. ON REVISITING THE SEA-SHORE AFTER LONG ABSENCE, UNDER STRONG MEDICAL RECOMMENDATION NOT TO BATHE God be with thee, gladsome Ocean! How gladly greet I thee once more! Ships and waves, and ceaseless motion, And men rejoicing on thy shore. Dissuading spake the mild Physician, ‘Those briny waves for thee are Death!’ But my soul fulfilled her mission, And lo! I breathe untroubled breath! Fashion's pining sons and daughters, That seek the crowd they seem to fly, Trembling they approach thy waters; And what cares Nature, if they die? Me a thousand hopes and pleasures, A thousand recollections bland, Thoughts sublime, and stately measures, Revisit on thy echoing strand: Dreams (the Soul herself forsaking), Tearful raptures, boyish mirth; Silent adorations, making A blessed shadow of this Earth! O ye hopes, that stir within me, Health comes with you from above! God is with me, God is in me! I cannot die, if Life be Love. August, 1801. ODE TO TRANQUILLITY Tranquillity! thou better name Than all the family of Fame! Thou ne'er wilt leave my riper age To low intrigue, or factious rage; For oh! dear child of thoughtful Truth, To thee I gave my early youth, And left the bark, and blest the steadfast shore, Ere yet the tempest rose and scared me with its roar. Who late and lingering seeks thy shrine, On him but seldom, Power divine, Thy spirit rests! Satiety And Sloth, poor counterfeits of thee, Mock the tired worldling. Idle Hope And dire Remembrance interlope, To vex the feverish slumbers of the mind: The bubble floats before, the spectre stalks behind. But me thy gentle hand will lead At morning through the accustomed mead; And in the sultry summer's heat Will build me up a mossy seat; And when the gust of Autumn crowds, And breaks the busy moonlight clouds, Thou best the thought canst raise, the heart attune, Light as the busy clouds, calm as the gliding moon. The feeling heart, the searching soul, To thee I dedicate the whole! And while within myself I trace The greatness of some future race, Aloof with hermit-eye I scan The present works of present man— A wild and dream-like trade of blood and guile, Too foolish for a tear, too wicked for a smile! 1801. TO ASRA Are there two things, of all which men possess, That are so like each other and so near, As mutual Love seems like to Happiness? Dear Asra, woman beyond utterance dear! This Love which ever welling at my heart, Now in its living fount doth heave and fall, Now overflowing pours thro' every part Of all my frame, and fills and changes all, Like vernal waters springing up through snow, This Love that seeming great beyond the power Of growth, yet seemeth ever more to grow, Could I transmute the whole to one rich Dower Of Happy Life, and give it all to Thee, Thy lot, methinks, were Heaven, thy age, Eternity! 1801. THE SECOND BIRTH There are two births, the one when Light First strikes the new-awaken'd sense— The other when two souls unite, And we must count our life from then. When you lov'd me, and I lov'd you, Then both of us were born anew. ? 1801. LOVE'S SANCTUARY This yearning heart (Love! witness what I say) Enshrines thy form as purely as it may, Round which, as to some spirit uttering bliss, My thoughts all stand ministrant night and day Like saintly Priests, that dare not think amiss. ? 1801. DEJECTION: AN ODE [WRITTEN APRIL 4, 1802] Late, late yestreen I saw the new Moon, With the old Moon in her arms; And I fear, I fear, my Master dear! We shall have a deadly storm. Ballad of Sir Patrick Spence. I Well! If the Bard was weather-wise, who made The grand old ballad of Sir Patrick Spence, This night, so tranquil now, will not go hence Unroused by winds, that ply a busier trade Than those which mould yon cloud in lazy flakes, Or the dull sobbing draft, that moans and rakes Upon the strings of this Æolian lute, Which better far were mute. For lo! the New-moon winter-bright! And overspread with phantom light, (With swimming phantom light o'erspread But rimmed and circled by a silver thread) I see the old Moon in her lap, foretelling The coming-on of rain and squally blast. And oh! that even now the gust were swelling, And the slant night-shower driving loud and fast! Those sounds which oft have raised me, whilst they awed, And sent my soul abroad, Might now perhaps their wonted impulse give, Might startle this dull pain, and make it move and live! II A grief without a pang, void, dark, and drear, A stifled, drowsy, unimpassioned grief, Which finds no natural outlet, no relief, In word, or sigh, or tear— O Lady! in this wan and heartless mood, To other thoughts by yonder throstle woo'd, All this long eve, so balmy and serene, Have I been gazing on the western sky, And its peculiar tint of yellow green: And still I gaze—and with how blank an eye! And those thin clouds above, in flakes and bars, That give away their motion to the stars; Those stars, that glide behind them or between, Now sparkling, now bedimmed, but always seen: Yon crescent Moon, as fixed as if it grew In its own cloudless, starless lake of blue; I see them all so excellently fair, I see, not feel, how beautiful they are! III My genial spirits fail; And what can these avail To lift the smothering weight from off my breast? It were a vain endeavour, Though I should gaze for ever On that green light that lingers in the west: I may not hope from outward forms to win The passion and the life, whose fountains are within. IV O Lady! we receive but what we give, And in our life alone does Nature live: Ours is her wedding garment, ours her shroud! And would we aught behold, of higher worth, Than that inanimate cold world allowed To the poor loveless ever-anxious crowd, Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud Enveloping the Earth— And from the soul itself must there be sent A sweet and potent voice, of its own birth, Of all sweet sounds the life and element! V O pure of heart! thou need'st not ask of me What this strong music in the soul may be! What, and wherein it doth exist, This light, this glory, this fair luminous mist, This beautiful and beauty-making power. Joy, virtuous Lady! Joy that ne'er was given, Save to the pure, and in their purest hour, Life, and Life's effluence, cloud at once and shower, Joy, Lady! is the spirit and the power, Which wedding Nature to us gives in dower A new Earth and new Heaven, Undreamt of by the sensual and the proud— Joy is the sweet voice, Joy the luminous cloud— We in ourselves rejoice! And thence flows all that charms or ear or sight, All melodies the echoes of that voice, All colours a suffusion from that light. VI There was a time when, though my path was rough, This joy within me dallied with distress, And all misfortunes were but as the stuff Whence Fancy made me dreams of happiness: For hope grew round me, like the twining vine, And fruits, and foliage, not my own, seemed mine. But now afflictions bow me down to earth: Nor care I that they rob me of my mirth; But oh! each visitation Suspends what nature gave me at my birth, My shaping spirit of Imagination. For not to think of what I needs must feel, But to be still and patient, all I can; And haply by abstruse research to steal From my own nature all the natural man— This was my sole resource, my only plan: Till that which suits a part infects the whole, And now is almost grown the habit of my soul. VII Hence, viper thoughts, that coil around my mind, Reality's dark dream! I turn from you, and listen to the wind, Which long has raved unnoticed. What a scream Of agony by torture lengthened out That lute sent forth! Thou Wind, that rav'st without, Bare crag, or mountain-tairn, or blasted tree, Or pine-grove whither woodman never clomb, Or lonely house, long held the witches' home, Methinks were fitter instruments for thee, Mad Lutanist! who in this month of showers, Of dark-brown gardens, and of peeping flowers, Mak'st Devils' yule, with worse than wintry song, The blossoms, buds, and timorous leaves among. Thou Actor, perfect in all tragic sounds! Thou mighty Poet, e'en to frenzy bold! What tell'st thou now about? 'Tis of the rushing of an host in rout, With groans, of trampled men, with smarting wounds— At once they groan with pain, and shudder with the cold! But hush! there is a pause of deepest silence! And all that noise, as of a rushing crowd, With groans, and tremulous shudderings—all is over— It tells another tale, with sounds less deep and loud! A tale of less affright, And tempered with delight, As Otway's self had framed the tender lay,— 'Tis of a little child Upon a lonesome wild, Not far from home, but she hath lost her way: And now moans low in bitter grief and fear, And now screams loud, and hopes to make her mother hear. VIII 'Tis midnight, but small thoughts have I of sleep: Full seldom may my friend such vigils keep! Visit her, gentle Sleep! with wings of healing, And may this storm be but a mountain-birth, May all the stars hang bright above her dwelling, Silent as though they watched the sleeping Earth! With light heart may she rise, Gay fancy, cheerful eyes, Joy lift her spirit, joy attune her voice; To her may all things live, from pole to pole, Their life the eddying of her living soul! O simple spirit, guided from above, Dear Lady friend devoutest of my choice, Thus mayest thou ever, evermore rejoice. 1802. THE PICTURE OR THE LOVER'S RESOLUTION Through weeds and thorns, and matted underwood I force my way; now climb, and now descend O'er rocks, or bare or mossy, with wild foot Crushing the purple whorts; while oft unseen, Hurrying along the drifted forest-leaves, The scared snake rustles. Onward still I toil, I know not, ask not whither! A new joy, Lovely as light, sudden as summer gust, And gladsome as the first-born of the spring, Beckons me on, or follows from behind, Playmate, or guide! The master-passion quelled, I feel that I am free. With dun-red bark The fir-trees, and the unfrequent slender oak, Forth from this tangle wild of bush and brake Soar up, and form a melancholy vault High o'er me, murmuring like a distant sea. Here Wisdom might resort, and here Remorse; Here too the love-lorn man, who, sick in soul, And of this busy human heart aweary, Worships the spirit of unconscious life In tree or wild-flower.—Gentle lunatic! If so he might not wholly cease to be, He would far rather not be that he is; But would be something that he knows not of, In winds or waters, or among the rocks! But hence, fond wretch! breathe not contagion here! No myrtle-walks are these: these are no groves Where Love dare loiter! If in sullen mood He should stray hither, the low stumps shall gore His dainty feet, the briar and the thorn Make his plumes haggard. Like a wounded bird Easily caught, ensnare him, O ye Nymphs, Ye Oreads chaste, ye dusky Dryades! And you, ye Earth-winds! you that make at morn The dew-drops quiver on the spiders' webs! You, O ye wingless Airs! that creep between The rigid stems of heath and bitten furze, Within whose scanty shade, at summer-noon, The mother-sheep hath worn a hollow bed— Ye, that now cool her fleece with dropless damp, Now pant and murmur with her feeding lamb. Chase, chase him, all ye Fays, and elfin Gnomes! With prickles sharper than his darts bemock His little Godship, making him perforce Creep through a thorn-bush on yon hedgehog's back. This is my hour of triumph! I can now With my own fancies play the merry fool, And laugh away worse folly, being free. Here will I seat myself, beside this old, Hollow, and weedy oak, which ivy-twine Clothes as with net-work: here will I couch my limbs, Close by this river, in this silent shade, As safe and sacred from the step of man As an invisible world—unheard, unseen, And listening only to the pebbly brook That murmurs with a dead, yet tinkling sound; Or to the bees, that in the neighbouring trunk Make honey-hoards. The breeze, that visits me, Was never Love's accomplice, never raised The tendril ringlets from the maiden's brow, And the blue, delicate veins above her cheek; Ne'er played the wanton—never half disclosed The maiden's snowy bosom, scattering thence Eye-poisons for some love-distempered youth, Who ne'er henceforth may see an aspen-grove Shiver in sunshine, but his feeble heart Shall flow away like a dissolving thing. Sweet breeze! thou only, if I guess aright, Liftest the feathers of the robin's breast, That swells its little breast, so full of song, Singing above me, on the mountain-ash. And thou too, desert stream! no pool of thine, Though clear as lake in latest summer-eve, Did e'er reflect the stately virgin's robe, The face, the form divine, the downcast look Contemplative! Behold! her open palm Presses her cheek and brow! her elbow rests On the bare branch of half-uprooted tree, That leans towards its mirror! Who erewhile Had from her countenance turned, or looked by stealth, (For Fear is true-love's cruel nurse), he now With steadfast gaze and unoffending eye, Worships the watery idol, dreaming hopes Delicious to the soul, but fleeting, vain, E'en as that phantom-world on which he gazed, But not unheeded gazed: for see, ah! see, The sportive tyrant with her left hand plucks The heads of tall flowers that behind her grow, Lychnis, and willow-herb, and fox-glove bells: And suddenly, as one that toys with time, Scatters them on the pool! Then all the charm Is broken—all that phantom world so fair Vanishes, and a thousand circlets spread, And each mis-shape the other. Stay awhile, Poor youth, who scarcely dar'st lift up thine eyes! The stream will soon renew its smoothness, soon The visions will return! And lo! he stays: And soon the fragments dim of lovely forms Come trembling back, unite, and now once more The pool becomes a mirror; and behold Each wildflower on the marge inverted there, And there the half-uprooted tree—but where, O where the virgin's snowy arm, that leaned On its bare branch? He turns, and she is gone! Homeward she steals through many a woodland maze Which he shall seek in vain. Ill-fated youth! Go, day by day, and waste thy manly prime In mad love-yearning by the vacant brook, Till sickly thoughts bewitch thine eyes, and thou Behold'st her shadow still abiding there, The Naiad of the mirror! Not to thee, O wild and desert stream! belongs this tale: Gloomy and dark art thou—the crowded firs Spire from thy shores, and stretch across thy bed, Making thee doleful as a cavern-well: Save when the shy king-fishers build their nest On thy steep banks, no loves hast thou, wild stream! This be my chosen haunt—emancipate From Passion's dreams, a freeman, and alone, I rise and trace its devious course. O lead, Lead me to deeper shades and lonelier glooms. Lo! stealing through the canopy of firs, How fair the sunshine spots that mossy rock, Isle of the river, whose disparted waves Dart off asunder with an angry sound, How soon to re-unite! And see! they meet, Each in the other lost and found: and see Placeless, as spirits, one soft water-sun Throbbing within them, heart at once and eye! With its soft neighbourhood of filmy clouds, The stains and shadings of forgotten tears, Dimness o'erswum with lustre! Such the hour Of deep enjoyment, following love's brief feuds; And hark, the noise of a near waterfall! I pass forth into light—I find myself Beneath a weeping birch (most beautiful Of forest trees, the Lady of the Woods), Hard by the brink of a tall weedy rock That overbrows the cataract. How bursts The landscape on my sight! Two crescent hills Fold in behind each other, and so make A circular vale, and land-locked, as might seem, With brook and bridge, and grey stone cottages, Half hid by rocks and fruit-trees. At my feet, The whortle-berries are bedewed with spray, Dashed upwards by the furious waterfall. How solemnly the pendent ivy-mass Swings in its winnow: All the air is calm. The smoke from cottage-chimneys, tinged with light, Rises in columns; from this house alone, Close by the water-fall, the column slants, And feels its ceaseless breeze. But what is this? That cottage, with its slanting chimney-smoke, And close beside its porch a sleeping child, His dear head pillowed on a sleeping dog— One arm between its fore-legs, and the hand Holds loosely its small handful of wild-flowers, Unfilletted, and of unequal lengths. A curious picture, with a master's haste Sketched on a strip of pinky-silver skin, Peeled from the birchen bark! Divinest maid! Yon bark her canvas, and those purple berries Her pencil! See, the juice is scarcely dried On the fine skin! She has been newly here; And lo! yon patch of heath has been her couch— The pressure still remains! O blesséd couch! For this may'st thou flower early, and the sun, Slanting at eve, rest bright, and linger long Upon thy purple bells! O Isabel! Daughter of genius! stateliest of our maids! More beautiful than whom Alcaeus wooed, The Lesbian woman of immortal song! O child of genius! stately, beautiful, And full of love to all, save only me, And not ungentle e'en to me! My heart, Why beats it thus? Through yonder coppice-wood Needs must the pathway turn, that leads straightway On to her father's house. She is alone! The night draws on—such ways are hard to hit— And fit it is I should restore this sketch, Dropt unawares, no doubt. Why should I yearn To keep the relique? 'twill but idly feed The passion that consumes me. Let me haste! The picture in my hand which she has left; She cannot blame me that I followed her: And I may be her guide the long wood through. 1802. TO MATILDA BETHAM FROM A STRANGER [‘One of our most celebrated poets, who had, I was told, picked out and praised the little piece ‘On a Cloud,’ another had quoted (saying it would have been faultless if I had not used the word Phoebus in it, which he thought inadmissible in modern poetry), sent me some verses inscribed “To Matilda Betham, from a Stranger”; and dated “Keswick, Sept. 9, 1802, S. T. C.” I should have guessed whence they came, but dared not flatter myself so highly as satisfactorily to believe it, before I obtained the avowal of the lady who had transmitted them. Excerpt from ‘Autobiographical Sketch’.] Matilda! I have heard a sweet tune played On a sweet instrument—thy Poesie— Sent to my soul by Boughton's pleading voice, Where friendship's zealous wish inspirited, Deepened and filled the subtle tones of taste: (So have I heard a Nightingale's fine notes Blend with the murmur of a hidden stream!) And now the fair, wild offspring of thy genius, Those wanderers whom thy fancy had sent forth To seek their fortune in this motley world, Have found a little home within my heart, And brought me, as the quit-rent of their lodging, Rose-buds, and fruit-blossoms, and pretty weeds, And timorous laurel leaflets half-disclosed, Engarlanded with gadding woodbine tendrils! A coronal, which, with undoubting hand, I twine around the brows of patriot Hope! The Almighty, having first composed a Man, Set him to music, framing Woman for him, And fitted each to each, and made them one! And 'tis my faith, that there's a natural bond Between the female mind and measured sounds, Nor do I know a sweeter Hope than this, That this sweet Hope, by judgment unreproved, That our own Britain, our dear mother Isle, May boast one Maid, a poetess indeed, Great as th' impassioned Lesbian, in sweet song, And O! of holier mind, and happier fate. Matilda! I dare twine thy vernal wreath Around the brows of patriot Hope! But thou Be wise! be bold! fulfil my auspices! Tho' sweet thy measures, stern must be thy thought, Patient thy study, watchful thy mild eye! Poetic feelings, like the stretching boughs Of mighty oaks, pay homage to the gales, Toss in the strong winds, drive before the gust, Themselves one giddy storm of fluttering leaves; Yet, all the while self-limited, remain Equally near the fixed and solid trunk Of Truth and Nature in the howling storm, As in the calm that stills the aspen grove. Be bold, meek Woman! but be wisely bold! Fly, ostrich-like, firm land beneath thy feet, Yet hurried onward by thy wings of fancy Swift as the whirlwind, singing in their quills. Look round thee! look within thee! think and feel! What nobler meed, Matilda! canst thou win, Than tears of gladness in a Boughton's eyes, And exultation even in strangers' hearts? 1802. HYMN BEFORE SUN-RISE, IN THE VALE OF CHAMOUNI Besides the Rivers, Arve and Arveiron, which have their sources in the foot of Mont Blanc, five conspicuous torrents rush down its sides; and within a few paces of the Glaciers, the Gentiana Major grows in immense numbers, with its ‘flowers of loveliest [liveliest Friend, 1809] blue.’ Hast thou a charm to stay the morning-star In his steep course? So long he seems to pause On thy bald awful head, O sovran Blanc, The Arve and Arveiron at thy base Rave ceaselessly; but thou, most awful Form! Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines, How silently! Around thee and above Deep is the air and dark, substantial, black, An ebon mass: methinks thou piercest it, As with a wedge! But when I look again, It is thine own calm home, thy crystal shrine, Thy habitation from eternity! O dread and silent Mount! I gazed upon thee, Till thou, still present to the bodily sense, Didst vanish from my thought: entranced in prayer I worshipped the Invisible alone. Yet, like some sweet beguiling melody, So sweet, we know not we are listening to it, Thou, the meanwhile, wast blending with my Thought, Yea, with my Life and Life's own secret joy: Till the dilating Soul, enrapt, transfused, Into the mighty vision passing—there As in her natural form, swelled vast to Heaven! Awake, my soul! not only passive praise Thou owest! not alone these swelling tears, Mute thanks and secret ecstasy! Awake, Voice of sweet song! Awake, my heart, awake! Green vales and icy cliffs, all join my Hymn. Thou first and chief, sole sovereign of the Vale! O struggling with the darkness all the night, And visited all night by troops of stars, Or when they climb the sky or when they sink: Companion of the morning-star at dawn, Thyself Earth's rosy star, and of the dawn Co-herald: wake, O wake, and utter praise! Who sank thy sunless pillars deep in Earth? Who filled thy countenance with rosy light? Who made thee parent of perpetual streams? And you, ye five wild torrents fiercely glad! Who called you forth from night and utter death, From dark and icy caverns called you forth, Down those precipitous, black, jaggéd rocks, For ever shattered and the same for ever? Who gave you your invulnerable life, Your strength, your speed, your fury, and your joy, Unceasing thunder and eternal foam? And who commanded (and the silence came), Here let the billows stiffen, and have rest? Ye Ice-falls! ye that from the mountain's brow Adown enormous ravines slope amain— Torrents, methinks, that heard a mighty voice, And stopped at once amid their maddest plunge! Motionless torrents! silent cataracts! Who made you glorious as the Gates of Heaven Beneath the keen full moon? Who bade the sun Clothe you with rainbows? Who, with living flowers Of loveliest blue, spread garlands at your feet?— God! let the torrents, like a shout of nations, Answer! and let the ice-plains echo, God! God! sing ye meadow-streams with gladsome voice! Ye pine-groves, with your soft and soul-like sounds! And they too have a voice, yon piles of snow, And in their perilous fall shall thunder, God! Ye living flowers that skirt the eternal frost! Ye wild goats sporting round the eagle's nest! Ye eagles, play-mates of the mountain-storm! Ye lightnings, the dread arrows of the clouds! Ye signs and wonders of the element! Utter forth God, and fill the hills with praise! Thou too, hoar Mount! with thy sky-pointing peaks, Oft from whose feet the avalanche, unheard, Shoots downward, glittering through the pure serene Into the depth of clouds, that veil thy breast— Thou too again, stupendous Mountain! thou That as I raise my head, awhile bowed low In adoration, upward from thy base Slow travelling with dim eyes suffused with tears, Solemnly seemest, like a vapoury cloud, To rise before me—Rise, O ever rise, Rise like a cloud of incense from the Earth! Thou kingly Spirit throned among the hills, Thou dread ambassador from Earth to Heaven, Great Hierarch! tell thou the silent sky, And tell the stars, and tell yon rising sun Earth, with her thousand voices, praises God. 1802. THE GOOD, GREAT MAN ‘How seldom, friend! a good great man inherits Honour or wealth with all his worth and pains! It sounds like stories from the land of spirits If any man obtain that which he merits Or any merit that which he obtains.’ REPLY TO THE ABOVE For shame, dear friend, renounce this canting strain! What would'st thou have a good great man obtain? Place? titles? salary? a gilded chain? Or throne of corses which his sword had slain? Greatness and goodness are not means, but ends! Hath he not always treasures, always friends, The good great man? three treasures, Love, and Light, And Calm Thoughts, regular as infant's breath: And three firm friends, more sure than day and night, Himself, his Maker, and the Angel Death! 1802. INSCRIPTION FOR A FOUNTAIN ON A HEATH This Sycamore, oft musical with bees,— Such tents the Patriarchs loved! O long unharmed May all its agéd boughs o'er-canopy The small round basin, which this jutting stone Keeps pure from falling leaves! Long may the Spring, Quietly as a sleeping infant's breath, Send up cold waters to the traveller With soft and even pulse! Nor ever cease Yon tiny cone of sand its soundless dance, Which at the bottom, like a Fairy's Page, As merry and no taller, dances still, Nor wrinkles the smooth surface of the Fount. Here Twilight is and Coolness: here is moss, A soft seat, and a deep and ample shade. Thou may'st toil far and find no second tree. Drink, Pilgrim, here; Here rest! and if thy heart Be innocent, here too shalt thou refresh Thy spirit, listening to some gentle sound, Or passing gale or hum of murmuring bees! 1802. AN ODE TO THE RAIN COMPOSED BEFORE DAYLIGHT, ON THE MORNING APPOINTED FOR THE DEPARTURE OF A VERY WORTHY, BUT NOT VERY PLEASANT VISITOR, WHOM IT WAS FEARED THE RAIN MIGHT DETAIN I I know it is dark; and though I have lain, Awake, as I guess, an hour or twain, I have not once opened the lids of my eyes, But I lie in the dark, as a blind man lies. O Rain! that I lie listening to, You're but a doleful sound at best: I owe you little thanks, 'tis true, For breaking thus my needful rest! Yet if, as soon as it is light, O Rain! you will but take your flight, I'll neither rail, nor malice keep, Though sick and sore for want of sleep. But only now, for this one day, Do go, dear Rain! do go away! II O Rain! with your dull two-fold sound, The clash hard by, and the murmur all round! You know, if you know aught, that we, Both night and day, but ill agree: For days and months, and almost years, Have limped on through this vale of tears, Since body of mine, and rainy weather, Have lived on easy terms together. Yet if, as soon as it is light, O Rain! you will but take your flight, Though you should come again to-morrow, And bring with you both pain and sorrow; Though stomach should sicken and knees should swell— I'll nothing speak of you but well. But only now for this one day, Do go, dear Rain! do go away! III Dear Rain! I ne'er refused to say You're a good creature in your way; Nay, I could write a book myself, Would fit a parson's lower shelf, Showing how very good you are.— What then? sometimes it must be fair And if sometimes, why not to-day? Do go, dear Rain! do go away! IV Dear Rain! if I've been cold and shy, Take no offence! I'll tell you why. A dear old Friend e'en now is here, And with him came my sister dear; After long absence now first met, Long months by pain and grief beset— We three dear friends! in truth, we groan Impatiently to be alone. We three, you mark! and not one more! The strong wish makes my spirit sore. We have so much to talk about, So many sad things to let out; So many tears in our eye-corners, Sitting like little Jacky Horners— In short, as soon as it is day, Do go, dear Rain! do go away. V And this I'll swear to you, dear Rain! Whenever you shall come again, Be you as dull as e'er you could (And by the bye 'tis understood, You're not so pleasant as you're good), Yet, knowing well your worth and place, I'll welcome you with cheerful face; And though you stayed a week or more, Were ten times duller than before; Yet with kind heart, and right good will, I'll sit and listen to you still; Nor should you go away, dear Rain! Uninvited to remain. But only now, for this one day, Do go, dear Rain! do go away. 1802. A DAY-DREAM My eyes make pictures, when they are shut: I see a fountain, large and fair, A willow and a ruined hut, And thee, and me and Mary there. O Mary! make thy gentle lap our pillow! Bend o'er us, like a bower, my beautiful green willow! A wild-rose roofs the ruined shed, And that and summer well agree: And lo! where Mary leans her head, Two dear names carved upon the tree! And Mary's tears, they are not tears of sorrow: Our sister and our friend will both be here to-morrow. 'Twas day! but now few, large, and bright, The stars are round the crescent moon! And now it is a dark warm night, The balmiest of the month of June! A glow-worm fall'n, and on the marge remounting Shines, and its shadow shines, fit stars for our sweet fountain. O ever—ever be thou blest! For dearly, Asra! love I thee! This brooding warmth across my breast, This depth of tranquil bliss—ah, me! Fount, tree and shed are gone, I know not whither, But in one quiet room we three are still together. The shadows dance upon the wall, By the still dancing fire-flames made; And now they slumber, moveless all! And now they melt to one deep shade! But not from me shall this mild darkness steal thee: I dream thee with mine eyes, and at my heart I feel thee! Thine eyelash on my cheek doth play— 'Tis Mary's hand upon my brow! But let me check this tender lay Which none may hear but she and thou! Like the still hive at quiet midnight humming, Murmur it to yourselves, ye two beloved women! 1802. ANSWER TO A CHILD'S QUESTION Do you ask what the birds say? The Sparrow, the Dove, The Linnet and Thrush say, ‘I love and I love!’ In the winter they're silent—the wind is so strong; What it says, I don't know, but it sings a loud song. But green leaves, and blossoms, and sunny warm weather, And singing, and loving—all come back together. But the Lark is so brimful of gladness and love, The green fields below him, the blue sky above, That he sings, and he sings; and for ever sings he— ‘I love my Love, and my Love loves me!’ 1802. THE DAY-DREAM FROM AN EMIGRANT TO HIS ABSENT WIFE If thou wert here, these tears were tears of light! But from as sweet a vision did I start As ever made these eyes grow idly bright! And though I weep, yet still around my heart A sweet and playful tenderness doth linger, Touching my heart as with an infant's finger. My mouth half open, like a witless man, I saw our couch, I saw our quiet room, Its shadows heaving by the fire-light gloom; And o'er my lips a subtle feeling ran, All o'er my lips a soft and breeze-like feeling— I know not what—but had the same been stealing Upon a sleeping mother's lips, I guess It would have made the loving mother dream That she was softly bending down to kiss Her babe, that something more than babe did seem, A floating presence of its darling father, And yet its own dear baby self far rather! Across my chest there lay a weight, so warm! As if some bird had taken shelter there; And lo! I seemed to see a woman's form— Thine, Sara, thine? O joy, if thine it were! I gazed with stifled breath, and feared to stir it, No deeper trance e'er wrapt a yearning spirit! And now, when I seemed sure thy face to see, Thy own dear self in our own quiet home; There came an elfish laugh, and wakened me: 'Twas Frederic, who behind my chair had clomb, And with his bright eyes at my face was peeping. I blessed him, tried to laugh, and fell a-weeping! 1801–2. THE HAPPY HUSBAND A FRAGMENT Oft, oft methinks, the while with thee, I breathe, as from the heart, thy dear And dedicated name, I hear A promise and a mystery, A pledge of more than passing life, Yea, in that very name of Wife! A pulse of love, that ne'er can sleep! A feeling that upbraids the heart With happiness beyond desert, That gladness half requests to weep! Nor bless I not the keener sense And unalarming turbulence Of transient joys, that ask no sting From jealous fears, or coy denying; But born beneath Love's brooding wing, And into tenderness soon dying, Wheel out their giddy moment, then Resign the soul to love again;— A more precipitated vein Of notes, that eddy in the flow Of smoothest song, they come, they go, And leave their sweeter understrain, Its own sweet self—a love of Thee That seems, yet cannot greater be! ? 1802. THE PAINS OF SLEEP Ere on my bed my limbs I lay, It hath not been my use to pray With moving lips or bended knees; But silently, by slow degrees, My spirit I to Love compose, In humble trust mine eye-lids close, With reverential resignation, No wish conceived, no thought exprest, Only a sense of supplication; A sense o'er all my soul imprest That I am weak, yet not unblest, Since in me, round me, every where Eternal Strength and Wisdom are. But yester-night I prayed aloud In anguish and in agony, Up-starting from the fiendish crowd Of shapes and thoughts that tortured me: A lurid light, a trampling throng, Sense of intolerable wrong, And whom I scorned, those only strong! Thirst of revenge, the powerless will Still baffled, and yet burning still! Desire with loathing strangely mixed On wild or hateful objects fixed. Fantastic passions! maddening brawl! And shame and terror over all! Deeds to be hid which were not hid, Which all confused I could not know Whether I suffered, or I did: For all seemed guilt, remorse or woe, My own or others still the same Life-stifling fear, soul-stifling shame. So two nights passed: the night's dismay Saddened and stunned the coming day. Sleep, the wide blessing, seemed to me Distemper's worst calamity. The third night, when my own loud scream Had waked me from the fiendish dream, O'ercome with sufferings strange and wild, I wept as I had been a child; And having thus by tears subdued My anguish to a milder mood, Such punishments, I said, were due To natures deepliest stained with sin,— For aye entempesting anew The unfathomable hell within, The horror of their deeds to view, To know and loathe, yet wish and do! Such griefs with such men well agree, But wherefore, wherefore fall on me? To be beloved is all I need, And whom I love, I love indeed. 1803. THE EXCHANGE We pledged our hearts, my love and I,— I in my arms the maiden clasping; I could not guess the reason why, But, oh! I trembled like an aspen. Her father's love she bade me gain; I went, but shook like any reed! I strove to act the man—in vain! We had exchanged our hearts indeed. 1804. AD VILMUM AXIOLOGUM [TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH] This be the meed, that thy song creates a thousand-fold echo! Sweet as the warble of woods, that awakes at the gale of the morning! List! the Hearts of the Pure, like caves in the ancient mountains Deep, deep in the Bosom, and from the Bosom resound it, Each with a different tone, complete or in musical fragments— All have welcomed thy Voice, and receive and retain and prolong it! This is the word of the Lord! it is spoken, and Beings Eternal Live and are borne as an Infant; the Eternal begets the Immortal: Love is the Spirit of Life, and Music the Life of the Spirit! ? 1805. AN EXILE Friend, Lover, Husband, Sister, Brother! Dear names close in upon each other! Alas! poor Fancy's bitter-sweet— Our names, and but our names can meet. 1805. SONNET [TRANSLATED FROM MARINI] Lady, to Death we're doom'd, our crime the same! Thou, that in me thou kindled'st such fierce heat; I, that my heart did of a Sun so sweet The rays concentre to so hot a flame. I, fascinated by an Adder's eye— Deaf as an Adder thou to all my pain; Thou obstinate in Scorn, in Passion I— I lov'd too much, too much didst thou disdain. Hear then our doom in Hell as just as stern, Our sentence equal as our crimes conspire— Who living bask'd at Beauty's earthly fire, In living flames eternal these must burn— Hell for us both fit places too supplies— In my heart thou wilt burn, I roast before thine eyes. ? 1805. PHANTOM All look and likeness caught from earth, All accident of kin and birth, Had pass'd away. There was no trace Of aught on that illumined face, Uprais'd beneath the rifted stone But of one spirit all her own;— She, she herself, and only she, Shone through her body visibly. 1805. A SUNSET Upon the mountain's edge with light touch resting, There a brief while the globe of splendour sits And seems a creature of the earth; but soon More changeful than the Moon, To wane fantastic his great orb submits, Or cone or mow of fire: till sinking slowly Even to a star at length he lessens wholly. Abrupt, as Spirits vanish, he is sunk! A soul-like breeze possesses all the wood. The boughs, the sprays have stood As motionless as stands the ancient trunk! But every leaf through all the forest flutters, And deep the cavern of the fountain mutters. 1805. WHAT IS LIFE? Resembles life what once was deem'd of light, Too ample in itself for human sight? An absolute self—an element ungrounded— All that we see, all colours of all shade By encroach of darkness made?— Is very life by consciousness unbounded? And all the thoughts, pains, joys of mortal breath, A war-embrace of wrestling life and death? 1805. THE BLOSSOMING OF THE SOLITARY DATE-TREE A LAMENT I seem to have an indistinct recollection of having read either in one of the ponderous tomes of George of Venice, or in some other compilation from the uninspired Hebrew writers, an apologue or Rabbinical tradition to the following purpose: While our first parents stood before their offended Maker, and the last words of the sentence were yet sounding in Adam's ear, the guileful false serpent, a counterfeit and a usurper from the beginning, presumptuously took on himself the character of advocate or mediator, and pretending to intercede for Adam, exclaimed: ‘Nay, Lord, in thy justice, not so! for the man was the least in fault. Rather let the Woman return at once to the dust, and let Adam remain in this thy Paradise.’ And the word of the Most High answered Satan: ‘The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. Treacherous Fiend! if with guilt like thine, it had been possible for thee to have the heart of a Man, and to feel the yearning of a human soul for its counterpart, the sentence, which thou now counsellest, should have been inflicted on thyself.’ The title of the following poem was suggested by a fact mentioned by Linnaeus, of a date-tree in a nobleman's garden which year after year had put forth a full show of blossoms, but never produced fruit, till a branch from another date-tree had been conveyed from a distance of some hundred leagues. The first leaf of the MS. from which the poem has been transcribed, and which contained the two or three introductory stanzas, is wanting: and the author has in vain taxed his memory to repair the loss. But a rude draught of the poem contains the substance of the stanzas, and the reader is requested to receive it as the substitute. It is not impossible, that some congenial spirit, whose years do not exceed those of the Author at the time the poem was written, may find a pleasure in restoring the Lament to its original integrity by a reduction of the thoughts to the requisite metre. S.T.C. 1 Beneath the blaze of a tropical sun the mountain peaks are the Thrones of Frost, through the absence of objects to reflect the rays. ‘What no one with us shares, seems scarce our own.’ The presence of a ONE, The best belov'd, who loveth me the best, is for the heart, what the supporting air from within is for the hollow globe with its suspended car. Deprive it of this, and All without, that would have buoyed it aloft even to the seat of the gods, becomes a burthen and crushes it into flatness. 2 The finer the sense for the beautiful and the lovely, and the fairer and lovelier the object presented to the sense; the more exquisite the individual's capacity of joy, and the more ample his means and opportunities of enjoyment, the more heavily will he feel the ache of solitariness, the more unsubstantial becomes the feast spread around him. What matters it, whether in fact the viands and the ministering graces are shadowy or real, to him who has not hand to grasp nor arms to embrace them? 3 Imagination; honourable aims; Free commune with the choir that cannot die; Science and song; delight in little things, The buoyant child surviving in the man; Fields, forests, ancient mountains, ocean, sky, With all their voices—O dare I accuse My earthly lot as guilty of my spleen, Or call my destiny niggard! O no! no! It is her largeness, and her overflow, Which being incomplete, disquieteth me so! 4 For never touch of gladness stirs my heart, But tim'rously beginning to rejoice Like a blind Arab, that from sleep doth start In lonesome tent, I listen for thy voice. Belovéd 'tis not thine; thou art not there! Then melts the bubble into idle air, And wishing without hope I restlessly despair. 5 The mother with anticipated glee Smiles o'er the child, that, standing by her chair And flatt'ning its round cheek upon her knee, Looks up, and doth its rosy lips prepare To mock the coming sounds. At that sweet sight She hears her own voice with a new delight; And if the babe perchance should lisp the notes aright, 6 Then is she tenfold gladder than before! But should disease or chance the darling take, What then avail those songs, which sweet of yore Were only sweet for their sweet echo's sake? Dear maid! no prattler at a mother's knee Was e'er so dearly prized as I prize thee: Why was I made for Love and Love denied to me? 1805. SEPARATION A sworded man whose trade is blood, In grief, in anger, and in fear, Thro' jungle, swamp, and torrent flood, I seek the wealth you hold so dear! The dazzling charm of outward form, The power of gold, the pride of birth, Have taken Woman's heart by storm— Usurp'd the place of inward worth. Is not true Love of higher price Than outward Form, though fair to see, Wealth's glittering fairy-dome of ice, Or echo of proud ancestry?— O! Asra, Asra! couldst thou see Into the bottom of my heart, There's such a mine of Love for thee, As almost might supply desert! (This separation is, alas! Too great a punishment to bear; O! take my life, or let me pass That life, that happy life, with her!) The perils, erst with steadfast eye Encounter'd, now I shrink to see— Oh! I have heart enough to die— Not half enough to part from Thee! ? 1805. THE RASH CONJURER Strong spirit-bidding sounds! With deep and hollow voice, 'Twixt Hope and Dread, Seven Times I said Iohva Mitzoveh Vohoeen! And up came an imp in the shape of a Pea-hen! I saw, I doubted, And seven times spouted Johva Mitzoveh Yahóevoh?en! When Anti-Christ starting up, butting and b?ing, In the shape of a mischievous curly black Lamb— With a vast flock of Devils behind and beside, And before 'em their Shepherdess Lucifer's Dam, Riding astride On an old black Ram, With Tartary stirrups, knees up to her chin, And a sleek chrysom imp to her Dugs muzzled in,— ‘Gee-up, my old Belzy! (she cried, As she sung to her suckling cub) Trit-a-trot, trot! we'll go far and wide Trot, Ram-Devil! Trot! Belzebub!’ Her petticoat fine was of scarlet Brocade, And soft in her lap her Baby she lay'd With his pretty Nubs of Horns asprouting, And his pretty little Tail all curly-twirly— St. Dunstan! and this comes of spouting— Of Devils what a Hurly-Burly! ‘Behold we are up! what want'st thou then?’ ‘Sirs! only that’—‘Say when and what’— ‘You'd be so good’—‘Say what and when’ ‘This moment to get down again!’ ‘We do it! we do it! we all get down! But we take you with us to swim or drown! Down a down to the grim Engulpher!’ ‘O me! I am floundering in Fire and Sulphur! That the Dragon had scrounched you, squeal and squall— Cabbalists! Conjurers! great and small, Johva Mitzoveh Evoh?en and all! Had I never uttered your jaw-breaking words, I might now have been sloshing down Junket and Curds, Like a Devonshire Christian: But now a Philistine! Ye Earthmen! be warned by a judgement so tragic, And wipe yourselves cleanly with all books of magic— Hark! hark! it is Dives! ‘Hold your Bother, you Booby! I am burnt ashy white, and you yet are but ruby.’ Epilogue. We ask and urge (here ends the story) All Christian Papishes to pray That this unhappy Conjurer may Instead of Hell, be but in Purgatory— For then there's Hope,— Long live the Pope! Catholicus. ? 1805, ? 1814. A CHILD'S EVENING PRAYER Ere on my bed my limbs I lay, God grant me grace my prayers to say: O God! preserve my mother dear In strength and health for many a year; And, O! preserve my father too, And may I pay him reverence due; And may I my best thoughts employ To be my parents' hope and joy; And O! preserve my brothers both From evil doings and from sloth, And may we always love each other Our friends, our father, and our mother: And still, O Lord, to me impart An innocent and grateful heart, That after my great sleep I may Awake to thy eternal day! Amen. 1806.

If Derwent be innocent, steady, and wise, And delight in the things of earth, water, and skies; Tender warmth at his heart, with these metres to show it, With sound sense in his brains, may make Derwent a poet,— May crown him with fame, and must win him the love Of his father on earth and his Father above. My dear, dear child! Could you stand upon Skiddaw, you would not from its whole ridge See a man who so loves you as your fond S. T. Coleridge. 1806. FAREWELL TO LOVE Farewell, sweet Love! yet blame you not my truth; More fondly ne'er did mother eye her child Than I your form: yours were my hopes of youth, And as you shaped my thoughts I sighed or smiled. While most were wooing wealth, or gaily swerving To pleasure's secret haunts, and some apart Stood strong in pride, self-conscious of deserving, To you I gave my whole weak wishing heart. And when I met the maid that realised Your fair creations, and had won her kindness, Say, but for her if aught on earth I prized! Your dreams alone I dreamt, and caught your blindness. O grief!—but farewell, Love! I will go play me With thoughts that please me less, and less betray me. 1806. TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH COMPOSED ON THE NIGHT AFTER HIS RECITATION OF A POEM ON THE GROWTH OF AN INDIVIDUAL MIND Friend of the wise! and Teacher of the Good! Into my heart have I received that Lay More than historic, that prophetic Lay Wherein (high theme by thee first sung aright) Of the foundations and the building up Of a Human Spirit thou hast dared to tell What may be told, to the understanding mind Revealable; and what within the mind By vital breathings secret as the soul Of vernal growth, oft quickens in the heart Thoughts all too deep for words!— Theme hard as high! Of smiles spontaneous, and mysterious fears (The first-born they of Reason and twin-birth), Of tides obedient to external force, And currents self-determined, as might seem, Or by some inner Power; of moments awful, Now in thy inner life, and now abroad, When power streamed from thee, and thy soul received The light reflected, as a light bestowed— Of fancies fair, and milder hours of youth, Hyblean murmurs of poetic thought Industrious in its joy, in vales and glens Native or outland, lakes and famous hills! Or on the lonely high-road, when the stars Were rising; or by secret mountain-streams, The guides and the companions of thy way! Of more than Fancy, of the Social Sense Distending wide, and man beloved as man, Where France in all her towns lay vibrating Like some becalméd bark beneath the burst Of Heaven's immediate thunder, when no cloud Is visible, or shadow on the main. For thou wert there, thine own brows garlanded, Amid the tremor of a realm aglow, Amid a mighty nation jubilant, When from the general heart of human kind Hope sprang forth like a full-born Deity! —Of that dear Hope afflicted and struck down, So summoned homeward, thenceforth calm and sure From the dread watch-tower of man's absolute self, With light unwaning on her eyes, to look Far on—herself a glory to behold, The Angel of the vision! Then (last strain) Of Duty, chosen Laws controlling choice, Action and joy!—An Orphic song indeed, A song divine of high and passionate thoughts To their own music chaunted! O great Bard! Ere yet that last strain dying awed the air, With stedfast eye I viewed thee in the choir Of ever-enduring men. The truly great Have all one age, and from one visible space Shed influence! They, both in power and act, Are permanent, and Time is not with them, Save as it worketh for them, they in it. Nor less a sacred Roll, than those of old, And to be placed, as they, with gradual fame Among the archives of mankind, thy work Makes audible a linkéd lay of Truth, Of Truth profound a sweet continuous lay, Not learnt, but native, her own natural notes! Ah! as I listened with a heart forlorn, The pulses of my being beat anew: And even as Life returns upon the drowned, Life's joy rekindling roused a throng of pains— Keen pangs of Love, awakening as a babe Turbulent, with an outcry in the heart; And fears self-willed, that shunned the eye of Hope; And Hope that scarce would know itself from Fear; Sense of past Youth, and Manhood come in vain, And Genius given, and Knowledge won in vain; And all which I had culled in wood-walks wild, And all which patient toil had reared, and all, Commune with thee had opened out—but flowers Strewed on my corse, and borne upon my bier, In the same coffin, for the self-same grave! That way no more! and ill beseems it me, Who came a welcomer in herald's guise, Singing of Glory, and Futurity, To wander back on such unhealthful road, Plucking the poisons of self-harm! And ill Such intertwine beseems triumphal wreaths Strew'd before thy advancing! Nor do thou, Sage Bard! impair the memory of that hour Of thy communion with my nobler mind By pity or grief, already felt too long! Nor let my words import more blame than needs. The tumult rose and ceased: for Peace is nigh Where Wisdom's voice has found a listening heart. Amid the howl of more than wintry storms, The Halcyon hears the voice of vernal hours Already on the wing. Eve following eve, Dear tranquil time, when the sweet sense of Home Is sweetest! moments for their own sake hailed And more desired, more precious, for thy song, In silence listening, like a devout child, My soul lay passive, by thy various strain Driven as in surges now beneath the stars, With momentary stars of my own birth, Fair constellated foam, still darting off Into the darkness; now a tranquil sea, Outspread and bright, yet swelling to the moon. And when—O Friend! my comforter and guide! Strong in thyself, and powerful to give strength!— Thy long sustainéd Song finally closed, And thy deep voice had ceased—yet thou thyself Wert still before my eyes, and round us both That happy vision of belovéd faces— Scarce conscious, and yet conscious of its close I sate, my being blended in one thought (Thought was it? or aspiration? or resolve?) Absorbed, yet hanging still upon the sound— And when I rose, I found myself in prayer. January, 1807. AN ANGEL VISITANT Within these circling hollies woodbine-clad— Beneath this small blue roof of vernal sky— How warm, how still! Tho' tears should dim mine eye, Yet will my heart for days continue glad, For here, my love, thou art, and here am I! ? 1801. RECOLLECTIONS OF LOVE I How warm this woodland wild Recess! Love surely hath been breathing here; And this sweet bed of heath, my dear! Swells up, then sinks with faint caress, As if to have you yet more near. II Eight springs have flown, since last I lay On sea-ward Quantock's heathy hills, Where quiet sounds from hidden rills Float here and there, like things astray, And high o'er head the sky-lark shrills. III No voice as yet had made the air Be music with your name; yet why That asking look? that yearning sigh? That sense of promise every where? Belovéd! flew your spirit by? IV As when a mother doth explore The rose-mark on her long-lost child, I met, I loved you, maiden mild! As whom I long had loved before— So deeply had I been beguiled. V You stood before me like a thought, A dream remembered in a dream. But when those meek eyes first did seem To tell me, Love within you wrought— O Greta, dear domestic stream! VI Has not, since then, Love's prompture deep, Has not Love's whisper evermore Been ceaseless, as thy gentle roar? Sole voice, when other voices sleep, Dear under-song in clamor's hour. 1807. TO TWO SISTERS [Mary Morgan and Charlotte Brent] A WANDERER'S FAREWELL To know, to esteem, to love,—and then to part— Makes up life's tale to many a feeling heart; Alas for some abiding-place of love, O'er which my spirit, like the mother dove, Might brood with warming wings! O fair! O kind! Sisters in blood, yet each with each intwined More close by sisterhood of heart and mind! Me disinherited in form and face By nature, and mishap of outward grace; Who, soul and body, through one guiltless fault Waste daily with the poison of sad thought, Me did you soothe, when solace hoped I none! And as on unthaw'd ice the winter sun, Though stern the frost, though brief the genial day, You bless my heart with many a cheerful ray; For gratitude suspends the heart's despair, Reflecting bright though cold your image there. Nay more! its music by some sweeter strain Makes us live o'er our happiest hours again, Hope re-appearing dim in memory's guise— Even thus did you call up before mine eyes Two dear, dear Sisters, prized all price above, Sisters, like you, with more than sisters' love; So like you they, and so in you were seen Their relative statures, tempers, looks, and mien, That oft, dear ladies! you have been to me At once a vision and reality. Sight seem'd a sort of memory, and amaze Mingled a trouble with affection's gaze. Oft to my eager soul I whisper blame, A Stranger bid it feel the Stranger's shame— My eager soul, impatient of the name, No strangeness owns, no Stranger's form descries: The chidden heart spreads trembling on the eyes. First-seen I gazed, as I would look you thro'! My best-beloved regain'd their youth in you,— And still I ask, though now familiar grown, Are you for their sakes dear, or for your own? O doubly dear! may Quiet with you dwell! In Grief I love you, yet I love you well! Hope long is dead to me! an orphan's tear Love wept despairing o'er his nurse's bier. Yet still she flutters o'er her grave's green slope: For Love's despair is but the ghost of Hope! Sweet Sisters! were you placed around one hearth With those, your other selves in shape and worth, Far rather would I sit in solitude, Fond recollections all my fond heart's food, And dream of you, sweet Sisters! (ah! not mine!) And only dream of you (ah! dream and pine!) Than boast the presence and partake the pride, And shine in the eye, of all the world beside. 1807. PSYCHE The butterfly the ancient Grecians made The soul's fair emblem, and its only name— But of the soul, escaped the slavish trade Of mortal life!—For in this earthly frame Ours is the reptile's lot, much toil, much blame, Manifold motions making little speed, And to deform and kill the things whereon we feed. 1808. A TOMBLESS EPITAPH 'Tis true, Idoloclastes Satyrane! (So call him, for so mingling blame with praise, And smiles with anxious looks, his earliest friends, Masking his birth-name, wont to character His wild-wood fancy and impetuous zeal,) 'Tis true that, passionate for ancient truths, And honouring with religious love the Great Of elder times, he hated to excess, With an unquiet and intolerant scorn, The hollow Puppets of a hollow Age, Ever idolatrous, and changing ever Its worthless Idols! Learning, Power, and Time, (Too much of all) thus wasting in vain war Of fervid colloquy. Sickness, 'tis true, Whole years of weary days, besieged him close, Even to the gates and inlets of his life! But it is true, no less, that strenuous, firm, And with a natural gladness, he maintained The citadel unconquered, and in joy Was strong to follow the delightful Muse. For not a hidden path, that to the shades Of the beloved Parnassian forest leads, Lurked undiscovered by him; not a rill There issues from the fount of Hippocrene, But he had traced it upward to its source, Through open glade, dark glen, and secret dell, Knew the gay wild flowers on its banks, and culled Its med'cinable herbs. Yea, oft alone, Piercing the long-neglected holy cave, The haunt obscure of old Philosophy, He bade with lifted torch its starry walls Sparkle, as erst they sparkled to the flame Of odorous lamps tended by Saint and Sage. O framed for calmer times and nobler hearts! O studious Poet, eloquent for truth! Philosopher! contemning wealth and death, Yet docile, childlike, full of Life and Love! Here, rather than on monumental stone, This record of thy worth thy Friend inscribes, Thoughtful, with quiet tears upon his cheek. ? 1809. FOR A MARKET-CLOCK (IMPROMPTU) What now, O Man! thou dost or mean'st to do Will help to give thee peace, or make thee rue, When hovering o'er the Dot this hand shall tell The moment that secures thee Heaven or Hell! 1809. THE MADMAN AND THE LETHARGIST AN EXAMPLE Quoth Dick to me, as once at College We argued on the use of knowledge;— ‘In old King Olim's reign, I've read, There lay two patients in one bed. The one in fat lethargic trance, Lay wan and motionless as lead: The other, (like the Folks in France), Possess'd a different disposition— In short, the plain truth to confess, The man was madder than Mad Bess! But both diseases, none disputed, Were unmedicinably rooted; Yet, so it chanc'd, by Heaven's permission, Each prov'd the other's true physician. ‘Fighting with a ghostly stare Troops of Despots in the air, Obstreperously Jacobinical, The madman froth'd, and foam'd, and roar'd: The other, snoring octaves cynical, Like good John Bull, in posture clinical, Seem'd living only when he snor'd. The Citizen enraged to see This fat Insensibility, Or, tir'd with solitary labour, Determin'd to convert his neighbour; So up he sprang and to 't he fell, Like devil piping hot from hell, With indefatigable fist Belabr'ing the poor Lethargist; Till his own limbs were stiff and sore, And sweat-drops roll'd from every pore:— Yet, still, with flying fingers fleet, Duly accompanied by feet, With some short intervals of biting, He executes the self-same strain, Till the Slumberer woke for pain, And half-prepared himself for fighting— That moment that his mad Colleague Sunk down and slept thro' pure fatigue. So both were cur'd—and this example Gives demonstration full and ample— That Chance may bring a thing to bear, Where Art sits down in blank despair.’ ‘That's true enough, Dick,’ answer'd I, ‘But as for the Example, 'tis a lie.’ ? 1809. THE VISIONARY HOPE Sad lot, to have no Hope! Though lowly kneeling He fain would frame a prayer within his breast, Would fain entreat for some sweet breath of healing, That his sick body might have ease and rest; He strove in vain! the dull sighs from his chest Against his will the stifling load revealing, Though Nature forced; though like some captive guest, Some royal prisoner at his conqueror's feast, An alien's restless mood but half concealing, The sternness on his gentle brow confessed, Sickness within and miserable feeling: Though obscure pangs made curses of his dreams, And dreaded sleep, each night repelled in vain, Each night was scattered by its own loud screams: Yet never could his heart command, though fain, One deep full wish to be no more in pain. That Hope, which was his inward bliss and boast, Which waned and died, yet ever near him stood, Though changed in nature, wander where he would— For Love's Despair is but Hope's pining Ghost! For this one hope he makes his hourly moan, He wishes and can wish for this alone! Pierced, as with light from Heaven, before its gleams (So the love-stricken visionary deems) Disease would vanish, like a summer shower, Whose dews fling sunshine from the noon-tide bower! Or let it stay! yet this one Hope should give Such strength that he would bless his pains and live. ? 1810. EPITAPH ON AN INFANT Its balmy lips the infant blest Relaxing from its Mother's breast, How sweet it heaves the happy sigh Of innocent satiety! And such my Infant's latest sigh! Oh tell, rude stone! the passer by, That here the pretty babe doth lie, Death sang to sleep with Lullaby. 1811. THE VIRGIN'S CRADLE-HYMN COPIED FROM A PRINT OF THE VIRGIN IN A ROMAN CATHOLIC VILLAGE IN GERMANY ENGLISH Sleep, sweet babe! my cares beguiling: Mother sits beside thee smiling; Sleep, my darling, tenderly! If thou sleep not, mother mourneth, Singing as her wheel she turneth: Come, soft slumber, balmily! 1811. TO A LADY OFFENDED BY A SPORTIVE OBSERVATION THAT WOMEN HAVE NO SOULS Nay, dearest Anna! why so grave? I said, you had no soul, 'tis true! For what you are, you cannot have: 'Tis I, that have one since I first had you! ? 1811. REASON FOR LOVE'S BLINDNESS I have heard of reasons manifold Why Love must needs be blind, But this the best of all I hold— His eyes are in his mind. What outward form and feature are He guesseth but in part; But that within is good and fair He seeth with the heart. ? 1811. THE SUICIDE'S ARGUMENT Ere the birth of my life, if I wished it or no, No question was asked me—it could not be so! If the life was the question, a thing sent to try, And to live on be Yes; what can No be? to die. NATURE'S ANSWER Is't returned, as 'twas sent? Is't no worse for the wear? Think first, what you are! Call to mind what you were! I gave you innocence, I gave you hope, Gave health, and genius, and an ample scope. Return you me guilt, lethargy, despair? Make out the invent'ry; inspect, compare! Then die—if die you dare! 1811. TIME, REAL AND IMAGINARY AN ALLEGORY On the wide level of a mountain's head, (I knew not where, but 'twas some faery place) Their pinions, ostrich-like, for sails out-spread, Two lovely children run an endless race, A sister and a brother! This far outstripp'd the other; Yet ever runs she with reverted face, And looks and listens for the boy behind: For he, alas! is blind! O'er rough and smooth with even step he passed, And knows not whether he be first or last. ? 1812. AN INVOCATION From REMORSE [Act III, Scene i. ll. 69-82.] Hear, sweet Spirit, hear the spell, Lest a blacker charm compel! So shall the midnight breezes swell With thy deep long-lingering knell. And at evening evermore, In a chapel on the shore, Shall the chaunter, sad and saintly, Yellow tapers burning faintly, Doleful masses chaunt for thee, Miserere Domine! Hush! the cadence dies away On the quiet moonlight sea: The boatmen rest their oars and say, Miserere Domine! 1812. THE NIGHT-SCENE A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT Sandoval. You loved the daughter of Don Manrique? Earl Henry. Loved? Sand. Did you not say you wooed her? Earl H. Once I loved Her whom I dared not woo! Sand. And wooed, perchance, One whom you loved not! Earl H. Oh! I were most base, Not loving Oropeza. True, I wooed her, Hoping to heal a deeper wound; but she Met my advances with impassioned pride, That kindled love with love. And when her sire, Who in his dream of hope already grasped The golden circlet in his hand, rejected My suit with insult, and in memory Of ancient feuds poured curses on my head, Her blessings overtook and baffled them! But thou art stern, and with unkindly countenance Art inly reasoning whilst thou listenest to me. Sand. Anxiously, Henry! reasoning anxiously. But Oropeza— Earl H. Blessings gather round her! Within this wood there winds a secret passage, Beneath the walls, which opens out at length Into the gloomiest covert of the garden.— The night ere my departure to the army, She, nothing trembling, led me through that gloom, And to that covert by a silent stream, Which, with one star reflected near its marge, Was the sole object visible around me. No leaflet stirred; the air was almost sultry; So deep, so dark, so close, the umbrage o'er us! No leaflet stirred;—yet pleasure hung upon The gloom and stillness of the balmy night-air. A little further on an arbour stood, Fragrant with flowering trees—I well remember What an uncertain glimmer in the darkness Their snow-white blossoms made—thither she led me, To that sweet bower! Then Oropeza trembled— I heard her heart beat—if 'twere not my own. Sand. A rude and scaring note, my friend! Earl H. Oh! no! I have small memory of aught but pleasure. The inquietudes of fear, like lesser streams Still flowing, still were lost in those of love: So love grew mightier from the fear, and Nature, Fleeing from Pain, sheltered herself in Joy. The stars above our heads were dim and steady, Like eyes suffused with rapture. Life was in us: We were all life, each atom of our frames A living soul—I vowed to die for her: With the faint voice of one who, having spoken, Relapses into blessedness, I vowed it: That solemn vow, a whisper scarcely heard, A murmur breathed against a lady's ear. Oh! there is joy above the name of pleasure. Deep self-possession, an intense repose. Sand. (with a sarcastic smile). No other than as eastern sages paint, The God, who floats upon a Lotos leaf, Dreams for a thousand ages; then awaking, Creates a world, and smiling at the bubble, Relapses into bliss. Earl H. Ah! was that bliss Feared as an alien, and too vast for man? For suddenly, impatient of its silence, Did Oropeza, starting, grasp my forehead. I caught her arms; the veins were swelling on them. Through the dark bower she sent a hollow voice;— ‘Oh! what if all betray me? what if thou?’ I swore, and with an inward thought that seemed The purpose and the substance of my being, I swore to her, that were she red with guilt, I would exchange my unblenched state with hers.— Friend! by that winding passage, to that bower I now will go—all objects there will teach me Unwavering love, and singleness of heart. Go, Sandoval! I am prepared to meet her— Say nothing of me—I myself will seek her— Nay, leave me, friend! I cannot bear the torment And keen inquiry of that scanning eye.— [Earl Henry retires into the wood. Sand. (alone). O Henry! always striv'st thou to be great By thine own act—yet art thou never great But by the inspiration of great passion. The whirl-blast comes, the desert-sands rise up And shape themselves; from Earth to Heaven they stand, As though they were the pillars of a temple, Built by Omnipotence in its own honour! But the blast pauses, and their shaping spirit Is fled: the mighty columns were but sand, And lazy snakes trail o'er the level ruins! 1813. A HYMN My Maker! of thy power the trace In every creature's form and face The wond'ring soul surveys: Thy wisdom, infinite above Seraphic thought, a Father's love As infinite displays! From all that meets or eye or ear, There falls a genial holy fear Which, like the heavy dew of morn, Refreshes while it bows the heart forlorn! Great God! thy works how wondrous fair! Yet sinful man didst thou declare The whole Earth's voice and mind! Lord, ev'n as Thou all-present art, O may we still with heedful heart Thy presence know and find! Then, come what will, of weal or woe, Joy's bosom-spring shall steady flow; For though 'tis Heaven Thyself to see, Where but thy Shadow falls, Grief cannot be!— 1814. TO A LADY WITH FALCONER'S SHIPWRECK Ah! not by Cam or Isis, famous streams, In archéd groves, the youthful poet's choice; Nor while half-listening, 'mid delicious dreams, To harp and song from lady's hand and voice; Not yet while gazing in sublimer mood On cliff, or cataract, in Alpine dell; Nor in dim cave with bladdery sea-weed strewed, Framing wild fancies to the ocean's swell; Our sea-bard sang this song! which still he sings, And sings for thee, sweet friend! Hark, Pity, hark! Now mounts, now totters on the tempest's wings, Now groans, and shivers, the replunging bark! ‘Cling to the shrouds!’ In vain! The breakers roar— Death shrieks! With two alone of all his clan Forlorn the poet paced the Grecian shore, No classic roamer, but a shipwrecked man! Say then, what muse inspired these genial strains, And lit his spirit to so bright a flame? The elevating thought of suffered pains, Which gentle hearts shall mourn; but chief, the name Of gratitude! remembrances of friend, Or absent or no more! shades of the Past, Which Love makes substance! Hence to thee I send, O dear as long as life and memory last! I send with deep regards of heart and head, Sweet maid, for friendship formed! this work to thee: And thou, the while thou canst not choose but shed A tear for Falconer, wilt remember me. ?1814. HUMAN LIFE ON THE DENIAL OF IMMORTALITY If dead, we cease to be; if total gloom Swallow up life's brief flash for aye, we fare As summer-gusts, of sudden birth and doom, Whose sound and motion not alone declare, But are their whole of being! If the breath Be Life itself, and not its task and tent, If even a soul like Milton's can know death; O Man! thou vessel purposeless, unmeant, Yet drone-hive strange of phantom purposes! Surplus of Nature's dread activity, Which, as she gazed on some nigh-finished vase, Retreating slow, with meditative pause, She formed with restless hands unconsciously. Blank accident! nothing's anomaly! If rootless thus, thus substanceless thy state, Go, weigh thy dreams, and be thy hopes, thy fears, The counter-weights!—Thy laughter and thy tears Mean but themselves, each fittest to create And to repay the other! Why rejoices Thy heart with hollow joy for hollow good? Why cowl thy face beneath the mourner's hood? Why waste thy sighs, and thy lamenting voices, Image of Image, Ghost of Ghostly Elf, That such a thing as thou feel'st warm or cold? Yet what and whence thy gain, if thou withhold These costless shadows of thy shadowy self? Be sad! be glad! be neither! seek, or shun! Thou hast no reason why! Thou canst have none; Thy being's being is contradiction. ?1815. SONG [A sunny shaft did I behold] FROM ZAPOLYA A sunny shaft did I behold, From sky to earth it slanted: And poised therein a bird so bold— Sweet bird, thou wert enchanted! He sank, he rose, he twinkled, he trolled Within that shaft of sunny mist; His eyes of fire, his beak of gold, All else of amethyst! And thus he sang: ‘Adieu! adieu! Love's dreams prove seldom true. The blossoms they make no delay: The sparkling dew-drops will not stay. Sweet month of May, We must away; Far, far away! To-day! to-day!’ 1815. HUNTING SONG FROM ZAPOLYA Up, up! ye dames, and lasses gay! To the meadows trip away. 'Tis you must tend the flocks this morn, And scare the small birds from the corn. Not a soul at home may stay: For the shepherds must go With lance and bow To hunt the wolf in the woods to-day. Leave the hearth and leave the house To the cricket and the mouse: Find grannam out a sunny seat, With babe and lambkin at her feet. Not a soul at home may stay: For the shepherds must go With lance and bow To hunt the wolf in the woods to-day. 1815. FAITH, HOPE, AND CHARITY FROM THE ITALIAN OF GUARINI FAITH Let those whose low delights to Earth are given Chaunt forth their earthly Loves! but we Must make an holier minstrelsy, And, heavenly-born, will sing the Things of Heaven. CHARITY But who for us the listening Heart shall gain? Inaudible as of the sphere Our music dies upon the ear, Enchanted with the mortal Syren's strain. HOPE Yet let our choral songs abound! Th' inspiring Power, its living Source, May flow with them and give them force, If, elsewhere all unheard, in Heaven they sound. ALL Aid thou our voice, Great Spirit! thou whose flame Kindled the Songster sweet of Israel, Who made so high to swell Beyond a mortal strain thy glorious Name. CHARITY AND FAITH Though rapt to Heaven, our mission and our care Is still to sojourn on the Earth, To shape, to soothe, Man's second Birth, And re-ascend to Heaven, Heaven's prodigal Heir! CHARITY What is Man's soul of Love deprived? HOPE. FAITH It like a Harp untunéd is, That sounds, indeed, but sounds amiss. CHARITY. HOPE From holy Love all good gifts are derived. FAITH But 'tis time that every nation Should hear how loftily we sing. FAITH. HOPE. CHARITY See, O World, see thy salvation! Let the Heavens with praises ring. Who would have a Throne above, Let him hope, believe and love; And whoso loves no earthly song, But does for heavenly music long, Faith, Hope, and Charity for him, Shall sing like wingéd Cherubim. 1815. TO NATURE It may indeed be phantasy, when I Essay to draw from all created things Deep, heartfelt, inward joy that closely clings; And trace in leaves and flowers that round me lie Lessons of love and earnest piety. So let it be; and if the wide world rings In mock of this belief, it brings Nor fear, nor grief, nor vain perplexity. So will I build my altar in the fields, And the blue sky my fretted dome shall be, And the sweet fragrance that the wild flower yields Shall be the incense I will yield to Thee, Thee only God! and thou shalt not despise Even me, the priest of this poor sacrifice. ?1820. LIMBO The sole true Something—This! In Limbo's Den It frightens Ghosts, as here Ghosts frighten men. Thence cross'd unseiz'd—and shall some fated hour Be pulveris'd by Demogorgon's power, And given as poison to annihilate souls— Even now it shrinks them—they shrink in as Moles (Nature's mute monks, live mandrakes of the ground) Creep back from Light—then listen for its sound;— See but to dread, and dread they know not why— The natural alien of their negative eye. 'Tis a strange place, this Limbo!—not a Place, Yet name it so;—where Time and weary Space Fettered from flight, with night-mare sense of fleeing, Strive for their last crepuscular half-being;— Lank Space, and scytheless Time with branny hands Barren and soundless as the measuring sands, Not mark'd by flit of Shades,—unmeaning they As moonlight on the dial of the day! But that is lovely—looks like Human Time,— An Old Man with a steady look sublime, That stops his earthly task to watch the skies; But he is blind—a Statue hath such eyes;— Yet having moonward turn'd his face by chance, Gazes the orb with moon-like countenance, With scant white hairs, with foretop bald and high, He gazes still,—his eyeless face all eye;— As 'twere an organ full of silent sight, His whole face seemeth to rejoice in light! Lip touching lip, all moveless, bust and limb— He seems to gaze at that which seems to gaze on him! No such sweet sights doth Limbo den immure, Wall'd round, and made a spirit-jail secure, By the mere horror of blank Naught-at-all, Whose circumambience doth these ghosts enthral. A lurid thought is growthless, dull Privation, Yet that is but a Purgatory curse; Hell knows a fear far worse, A fear—a future state;—'tis positive Negation! 1817. NE PLUS ULTRA Sole Positive of Night! Antipathist of Light! Fate's only essence! primal scorpion rod— The one permitted opposite of God!— Condenséd blackness and abysmal storm Compacted to one sceptre Arms the Grasp enorm— The Intercepter— The Substance that still casts the shadow Death!— The Dragon foul and fell— The unrevealable, And hidden one, whose breath Gives wind and fuel to the fires of Hell! Ah! sole despair Of both th' eternities in Heaven! Sole interdict of all-bedewing prayer, The all-compassionate! Save to the Lampads Seven Reveal'd to none of all th' Angelic State, Save to the Lampads Seven, That watch the throne of Heaven! ?1826. THE KNIGHT'S TOMB Where is the grave of Sir Arthur O'Kellyn? Where may the grave of that good man be?— By the side of a spring, on the breast of Helvellyn, Under the twigs of a young birch tree! The oak that in summer was sweet to hear, And rustled its leaves in the fall of the year, And whistled and roared in the winter alone, Is gone,—and the birch in its stead is grown.— The Knight's bones are dust, And his good sword rust;— His soul is with the saints, I trust. ?1817. ON DONNE'S POETRY With Donne, whose muse on dromedary trots, Wreathe iron pokers into true-love knots; Rhyme's sturdy cripple, fancy's maze and clue, Wit's forge and fire-blast, meaning's press and screw. ?1818. ISRAEL'S LAMENT ‘A Hebrew Dirge, chaunted in the Great Synagogue, St. James's Place, Aldgate, on the day of the Funeral of her Royal Highness the Princess Charlotte. By Hyman Hurwitz, Master of the Hebrew Academy, Highgate: with a Translation in English Verse, by S. T. Coleridge, Esq., 1817.’ Mourn, Israel! Sons of Israel, mourn! Give utterance to the inward throe! As wails, of her first love forlorn, The Virgin clad in robes of woe. Mourn the young Mother, snatch'd away From Light and Life's ascending Sun! Mourn for the Babe, Death's voiceless prey, Earn'd by long pangs and lost ere won. Mourn the bright Rose that bloom'd and went, Ere half disclosed its vernal hue! Mourn the green Bud, so rudely rent, It brake the stem on which it grew. Mourn for the universal woe With solemn dirge and fault'ring tongue: For England's Lady is laid low, So dear, so lovely, and so young! The blossoms on her Tree of Life Shone with the dews of recent bliss: Transplanted in that deadly strife, She plucks its fruits in Paradise. Mourn for the widow'd Lord in chief, Who wails and will not solaced be! Mourn for the childless Father's grief, The wedded Lover's agony! Mourn for the Prince, who rose at morn To seek and bless the firstling bud Of his own Rose, and found the thorn, Its point bedew'd with tears of blood. O press again that murmuring string! Again bewail that princely Sire! A destined Queen, a future King, He mourns on one funereal pyre. Mourn for Britannia's hopes decay'd, Her daughters wail their dear defence; Their fair example, prostrate laid, Chaste Love and fervid Innocence. While Grief in song shall seek repose, We will take up a Mourning yearly: To wail the blow that crush'd the Rose, So dearly priz'd and lov'd so dearly. Long as the fount of Song o'erflows Will I the yearly dirge renew: Mourn for the firstling of the Rose, That snapt the stem on which it grew. The proud shall pass, forgot; the chill, Damp, trickling Vault their only mourner! Not so the regal Rose, that still Clung to the breast which first had worn her! O thou, who mark'st the Mourner's path To sad Jeshurun's Sons attend! Amid the Light'nings of thy Wrath The showers of Consolation send! Jehovah frowns! the Islands bow! And Prince and People kiss the Rod!— Their dread chastising Judge wert thou! Be thou their Comforter, O God! 1817. FANCY IN NUBIBUS OR THE POET IN THE CLOUDS O! it is pleasant, with a heart at ease, Just after sunset, or by moonlight skies, To make the shifting clouds be what you please, Or let the easily persuaded eyes Own each quaint likeness issuing from the mould Of a friend's fancy; or with head bent low And cheek aslant see rivers flow of gold 'Twixt crimson banks; and then, a traveller, go From mount to mount through Cloudland, gorgeous land! Or list'ning to the tide, with closéd sight, Be that blind bard, who on the Chian strand By those deep sounds possessed with inward light, Beheld the Iliad and the Odyssee Rise to the swelling of the voiceful sea. 1817. THE TEARS OF A GRATEFUL PEOPLE A Hebrew Dirge and Hymn, chaunted in the Great Synagogue, St. James' pl. Aldgate, on the Day of the Funeral of King George III. of blessed memory. By Hyman Hurwitz of Highgate, Translated by a Friend. Dirge Oppress'd, confused, with grief and pain, And inly shrinking from the blow, In vain I seek the dirgeful strain, The wonted words refuse to flow. A fear in every face I find, Each voice is that of one who grieves; And all my Soul, to grief resigned, Reflects the sorrow it receives. The Day-Star of our glory sets! Our King has breathed his latest breath! Each heart its wonted pulse forgets, As if it own'd the pow'r of death. Our Crown, our heart's Desire is fled! Britannia's glory moults its wing! Let us with ashes on our head, Raise up a mourning for our King. Lo! of his beams the Day-Star shorn, Sad gleams the Moon through cloudy veil! The Stars are dim! Our Nobles mourn; The Matrons weep, their Children wail. No age records a King so just, His virtues numerous as his days; The Lord Jehovah was his trust, And truth with mercy ruled his ways. His Love was bounded by no Clime; Each diverse Race, each distant Clan He govern'd by this truth sublime, ‘God only knows the heart—not man.’ His word appall'd the sons of pride, Iniquity far wing'd her way; Deceit and fraud were scatter'd wide, And truth resum'd her sacred sway. He sooth'd the wretched, and the prey From impious tyranny he tore; He stay'd th' Usurper's iron sway, And bade the Spoiler waste no more. Thou too, Jeshurun's Daughter! thou, Th' oppress'd of nations and the scorn! Didst hail on his benignant brow A safety dawning like the morn. The scoff of each unfeeling mind, Thy doom was hard, and keen thy grief; Beneath his throne, peace thou didst find, And blest the hand that gave relief. E'en when a fatal cloud o'erspread The moonlight splendour of his sway, Yet still the light remain'd, and shed Mild radiance on the traveller's way. But he is gone—the Just! the Good! Nor could a Nation's pray'r delay The heavenly meed, that long had stood His portion in the realms of day. Beyond the mighty Isle's extent The mightier Nation mourns her Chief: Him Judah's Daughter shall lament, In tears of fervour, love and grief. Britannia mourns in silent grief; Her heart a prey to inward woe. In vain she strives to find relief, Her pang so great, so great the blow. Britannia! Sister! woe is me! Full fain would I console thy woe. But, ah! how shall I comfort thee, Who need the balm I would bestow? United then let us repair, As round our common Parent's grave; And pouring out our heart in prayer, Our heav'nly Father's mercy crave. Until Jehovah from his throne Shall heed his suffering people's fears; Shall turn to song the Mourner's groan, To smiles of joy the Nation's tears. Praise to the Lord! Loud praises sing! And bless Jehovah's righteous hand! Again he bids a George, our King, Dispense his blessings to the Land. Hymn O thron'd in Heav'n! Sole King of kings, Jehovah! hear thy Children's prayers and sighs! Thou Binder of the broken heart! with wings Of healing on thy people rise! Thy mercies, Lord, are sweet; And Peace and Mercy meet, Before thy Judgment seat: Lord, hear us! we entreat! When angry clouds thy throne surround, E'en from the cloud thou bid'st thy mercy shine: And ere thy righteous vengeance strikes the wound, Thy grace prepares the balm divine! Thy mercies, Lord, are sweet; etc. The Parent tree thy hand did spare— It fell not till the ripen'd fruit was won: Beneath its shade the Scion flourish'd fair, And for the Sire thou gav'st the Son. etc. This thy own Vine, which thou didst rear, And train up for us from the royal root, Protect, O Lord! and to the Nations near Long let it shelter yield. and fruit. etc. Lord, comfort thou the royal line: Let Peace and Joy watch round us hand and hand. Our Nobles visit with thy grace divine, And banish sorrow from the land! Thy mercies, Lord, are sweet; And Peace and Mercy meet Before thy Judgment seat; Lord, hear us! we entreat! 1820. YOUTH AND AGE Verse, a breeze mid blossoms straying, Where Hope clung feeding, like a bee— Both were mine! Life went a-maying With Nature, Hope, and Poesy, When I was young! When I was young?—Ah, woful When! Ah! for the change 'twixt Now and Then! This breathing house not built with hands, This body that does me grievous wrong, O'er aery cliffs and glittering sands, How lightly then it flashed along:— Like those trim skiffs, unknown of yore, On winding lakes and rivers wide, That ask no aid of sail or oar, That fear no spite of wind or tide! Nought cared this body for wind or weather When Youth and I lived in't together. Flowers are lovely; Love is flower-like; Friendship is a sheltering tree; O! the joys, that came down shower-like, Of Friendship, Love, and Liberty, Ere I was old! Ere I was old? Ah woful Ere, Which tells me, Youth's no longer here! O Youth! for years so many and sweet, 'Tis known, that Thou and I were one, I'll think it but a fond conceit— It cannot be that Thou art gone! Thy vesper-bell hath not yet toll'd:— And thou wert aye a masker bold! What strange disguise hast now put on, To make believe, that thou art gone? I see these locks in silvery slips, This drooping gait, this altered size: But Spring-tide blossoms on thy lips, And tears take sunshine from thine eyes! Life is but thought: so think I will That Youth and I are house-mates still. Dew-drops are the gems of morning, But the tears of mournful eve! Where no hope is, life's a warning That only serves to make us grieve, When we are old: That only serves to make us grieve With oft and tedious taking-leave, Like some poor nigh-related guest, That may not rudely be dismist; Yet hath outstay'd his welcome while, And tells the jest without the smile. 1823–1832. THE REPROOF AND REPLY Or, The Flower-Thief's Apology, for a robbery committed in Mr. and Mrs.—'s garden, on Sunday morning, 25th of May, 1823, between the hours of eleven and twelve. “Fie, Mr. Coleridge!—and can this be you? Break two commandments? and in church-time too! Have you not heard, or have you heard in vain, The birth-and-parentage-recording strain?— Confessions shrill, that out-shrill'd mack'rel drown Fresh from the drop—the youth not yet cut down— Letter to sweet-heart—the last dying speech— And didn't all this begin in Sabbath-breach? You, that knew better! In broad open day, Steal in, steal out, and steal our flowers away? What could possess you? Ah! sweet youth, I fear The chap with horns and tail was at your ear!” Such sounds of late, accusing fancy brought From fair Chisholm to the Poet's thought. Now hear the meek Parnassian youth's reply:— A bow—a pleading look—a downcast eye,— And then: “Fair dame! a visionary wight, Hard by your hill-side mansion sparkling white, His thoughts all hovering round the Muses' home, Long hath it been your Poet's wont to roam, And many a morn, on his becharméd sense So rich a stream of music issued thence, He deem'd himself, as it flowed warbling on, Beside the vocal fount of Helicon! But when, as if to settle the concern, A Nymph too he beheld, in many a turn, Guiding the sweet rill from its fontal urn,— Say, can you blame?—No! none that saw and heard Could blame a bard, that he thus inly stirr'd; A muse beholding in each fervent trait, Took Mary H— for Polly Hymnia! Or haply as there stood beside the maid One loftier form in sable stole array'd, If with regretful thought he hail'd in thee Chisholm, his long-lost friend, Mol Pomene! But most of you, soft warblings, I complain! 'Twas ye that from the bee-hive of my brain Did lure the fancies forth, a freakish rout, And witch'd the air with dreams turn'd inside out. “Thus all conspir'd—each power of eye and ear, And this gay month, th' enchantress of the year, To cheat poor me (no conjuror, God wot!) And Chisholm's self accomplice in the plot. Can you then wonder if I went astray? Not bards alone, nor lovers mad as they;— All Nature day-dreams in the month of May. And if I pluck'd ‘each flower that sweetest blows,’— Who walks in sleep, needs follow must his nose. Thus, long accustom'd on the twy-fork'd hill, To pluck both flower and floweret at my will; The garden's maze, like No-man's-land, I tread, Nor common law, nor statute in my head; For my own proper smell, sight, fancy, feeling, With autocratic hand at once repealing Five Acts of Parliament 'gainst private stealing! But yet from Chisholm who despairs of grace? There's no spring-gun or man-trap in that face! Let Moses then look black, and Aaron blue, That look as if they had little else to do: For Chisholm speaks, ‘Poor youth! he's but a waif! The spoons all right? the hen and chickens safe? Well, well, he shall not forfeit our regards— The Eighth Commandment was not made for Bards!’” 1823. FIRST ADVENT OF LOVE O fair is Love's first hope to gentle mind! As Eve's first star thro' fleecy cloudlet peeping; And sweeter than the gentle south-west wind. O'er willowy meads, and shadow'd waters creeping, And Ceres' golden fields;—the sultry hind Meets it with brow uplift, and stays his reaping. ?1824. THE DELINQUENT TRAVELLERS Some are home-sick—some two or three, Their third year on the Arctic Sea— Brave Captain Lyon tells us so— Spite of those charming Esquimaux. But O, what scores are sick of Home, Agog for Paris or for Rome! Nay! tho' contented to abide, You should prefer your own fireside; Yet since grim War has ceas'd its madding, And Peace has set John Bull agadding, 'Twould such a vulgar taste betray, For very shame you must away! ‘What? not yet seen the coast of France! The folks will swear, for lack of bail, You've spent your last five years in jail!’ Keep moving! Steam, or Gas, or Stage, Hold, cabin, steerage, hencoop's cage— Tour, Journey, Voyage, Lounge, Ride, Walk, Skim, Sketch, Excursion, Travel-talk— For move you must! 'Tis now the rage, The law and fashion of the Age. If you but perch, where Dover tallies, So strangely with the coast of Calais, With a good glass and knowing look. You'll soon get matter for a book! Or else, in Gas-car, take your chance Like that adventurous king of France, Who, once, with twenty thousand men Went up—and then came down again; At least, he moved if nothing more: And if there's nought left to explore, Yet while your well-greased wheels keep spinning, The traveller's honoured name you're winning, And, snug as Jonas in the Whale, You may loll back and dream a tale. Move, or be moved—there's no protection, Our Mother Earth has ta'en the infection— (That rogue Copernicus, 'tis said First put the whirring in her head,) A planet She, and can't endure T'exist without her annual Tour: The name were else a mere misnomer, Since Planet is but Greek for Roamer. The atmosphere, too, can do no less Than ventilate her emptiness, Bilks turn-pike gates, for no one cares, And gives herself a thousand airs— While streams and shopkeepers, we see, Will have their run toward the sea— And if, meantime, like old King Log, Or ass with tether and a clog, Must graze at home! to yawn and bray ‘I guess we shall have rain to-day! Nor clog nor tether can be worse Than the dead palsy of the purse. Money, I've heard a wise man say, Makes herself wings and flys away: Ah! would She take it in her head To make a pair for me instead! At all events, the Fancy's free, No traveller so bold as she. From Fear and Poverty released I'll saddle Pegasus, at least, And when she's seated to her mind, I within I can mount behind: And since this outward I, you know, Must stay because he cannot go, My fellow-travellers shall be they Who go because they cannot stay— Rogues, rascals, sharpers, blanks and prizes, Delinquents of all sorts and sizes, Fraudulent bankrupts, Knights burglarious, And demireps of means precarious— All whom Law thwarted, Arms or Arts, Compel to visit foreign parts, All hail! No compliments, I pray, I'll follow where you lead the way! But ere we cross the main once more, Methinks, along my native shore, Dismounting from my steed I'll stray Beneath the cliffs of Dumpton Bay, Where, Ramsgate and Broadstairs between, Rude caves and grated doors are seen: And here I'll watch till break of day, (For Fancy in her magic might Can turn broad noon to starless night!) When lo! methinks a sudden band Of smock-clad smugglers round me stand. Denials, oaths, in vain I try, At once they gag me for a spy, And stow me in the boat hard by. Suppose us fairly now afloat, Till Boulogne mouth receives our Boat. But, bless us! what a numerous band Of cockneys anglicise the strand! Delinquent bankrupts, leg-bail'd debtors, Some for the news, and some for letters— With hungry look and tarnished dress, French shrugs and British surliness. Sick of the country for their sake Of them and France French leave I take— And lo! a transport comes in view I hear the merry motley crew, Well skill'd in pocket to make entry, Of Dieman's Land the elected Gentry, And founders of Australian Races.— The Rogues! I see it in their faces! Receive me, Lads! I'll go with you, Hunt the black swan and kangaroo, And that New Holland we'll presume Old England with some elbow-room. Across the mountains we will roam, And each man make himself a home: Or, if old hàbits ne'er forsaking, Like clock-work of the Devil's making, Ourselves inveterate rogues should be, We'll have a virtuous progeny; And on the dunghill of our vices Raise human pine-apples and spices. Of all the children of John Bull With empty heads and bellies full, Who ramble East, West, North and South, With leaky purse and open mouth, In search of varieties exotic The usefullest and most patriotic, And merriest, too, believe me, Sirs! Are your Delinquent Travellers! 1824. WORK WITHOUT HOPE LINES COMPOSED 21ST FEBRUARY 1825 All Nature seems at work. Slugs leave their lair— The bees are stirring—birds are on the wing— And Winter slumbering in the open air, Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring! And I the while, the sole unbusy thing, Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing. Yet well I ken the banks where amaranths blow, Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow. Bloom, O ye amaranths! bloom for whom ye may, For me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away! With lips unbrightened, wreathless brow, I stroll: And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul? Work without Hope draws nectar in a sieve, And Hope without an object cannot live. 1825. SANCTI DOMINICI PALLIUM A DIALOGUE BETWEEN POET AND FRIEND FOUND WRITTEN ON THE BLANK LEAF AT THE BEGINNING OF BUTLER'S ‘BOOK OF THE CHURCH’ (1825) POET I note the moods and feelings men betray, And heed them more than aught they do or say; The lingering ghosts of many a secret deed Still-born or haply strangled in its birth; These best reveal the smooth man's inward creed! These mark the spot where lies the treasure—Worth! Milner, made up of impudence and trick, With cloven tongue prepared to hiss and lick, Rome's Brazen Serpent—boldly dares discuss The roasting of thy heart, O brave John Huss! And with grim triumph and a truculent glee Absolves anew the Pope-wrought perfidy, That made an empire's plighted faith a lie, And fix'd a broad stare on the Devil's eye— (Pleas'd with the guilt, yet envy-stung at heart To stand outmaster'd in his own black art!) Yet Milner— FRIEND Enough of Milner! we're agreed, Who now defends would then have done the deed. But who not feels persuasion's gentle sway, Who but must meet the proffered hand half way When courteous Butler— POET (aside) (Rome's smooth go-between!) FRIEND Laments the advice that soured a milky queen— (For ‘bloody’ all enlightened men confess An antiquated error of the press:) Who rapt by zeal beyond her sex's bounds, With actual cautery staunched the Church's wounds! And tho' he deems, that with too broad a blur We damn the French and Irish massacre, Yet blames them both—and thinks the Pope might err! What think you now? Boots it with spear and shield Against such gentle foes to take the field Whose beckoning hands the mild Caduceus wield? POET What think I now? Even what I thought before;— What Milner boasts though Butler may deplore, Still I repeat, words lead me not astray When the shown feeling points a different way. Smooth Butler can say grace at slander's feast, And bless each haut-gout cook'd by monk or priest; Leaves the full lie on Milner's gong to swell, Content with half-truths that do just as well; But duly decks his mitred comrade's flanks, And with him shares the Irish nation's thanks! So much for you, my friend! who own a Church, And would not leave your mother in the lurch! But when a Liberal asks me what I think— Scared by the blood and soot of Cobbett's ink, And Jeffrey's glairy phlegm and Connor's foam, In search of some safe parable I roam— An emblem sometimes may comprise a tome! Disclaimant of his uncaught grandsire's mood, I see a tiger lapping kitten's food: And who shall blame him that he purs applause, When brother Brindle pleads the good old cause; And frisks his pretty tail, and half unsheathes his claws! Yet not the less, for modern lights unapt, I trust the bolts and cross-bars of the laws More than the Protestant milk all newly lapt, Impearling a tame wild-cat's whisker'd jaws! 1825, or 1826. SONG [Though veiled in spires of myrtle-wreath] Though veiled in spires of myrtle-wreath, Love is a sword which cuts its sheath, And through the clefts itself has made, We spy the flashes of the blade! But through the clefts itself has made We likewise see Love's flashing blade, By rust consumed, or snapt in twain; And only hilt and stump remain. ?1825. A CHARACTER A bird, who for his other sins Had liv'd amongst the Jacobins; Though like a kitten amid rats, Or callow tit in nest of bats, He much abhorr'd all democrats; Yet nathless stood in ill report Of wishing ill to Church and Court, Tho' he'd nor claw, nor tooth, nor sting, And learnt to pipe God save the King; Tho' each day did new feathers bring, All swore he had a leathern wing; Nor polish'd wing, nor feather'd tail, Nor down-clad thigh would aught avail; And tho'—his tongue devoid of gall— He civilly assur'd them all:— ‘A bird am I of Phoebus' breed, And on the sunflower cling and feed; My name, good Sirs, is Thomas Tit!’ The bats would hail him Brother Cit, Or, at the furthest, cousin-german. At length the matter to determine, He publicly denounced the vermin; He spared the mouse, he praised the owl; But bats were neither flesh nor fowl. Blood-sucker, vampire, harpy, goul, Came in full clatter from his throat, Till his old nest-mates chang'd their note To hireling, traitor, and turncoat,— A base apostate who had sold His very teeth and claws for gold;— And then his feathers!—sharp the jest— No doubt he feather'd well his nest! ‘A Tit indeed! aye, tit for tat— With place and title, brother Bat, We soon shall see how well he'll play Count Goldfinch, or Sir Joseph Jay!’ Alas, poor Bird! and ill-bestarr'd— Or rather let us say, poor Bard! And henceforth quit the allegoric, With metaphor and simile, For simple facts and style historic:— Alas, poor Bard! no gold had he; Behind another's team he stept, And plough'd and sow'd, while others reapt; The work was his, but theirs the glory, Sic vos non vobis, his whole story. Besides, whate'er he wrote or said Came from his heart as well as head; And though he never left in lurch His king, his country, or his church, 'Twas but to humour his own cynical Contempt of doctrines Jacobinical; To his own conscience only hearty, 'Twas but by chance he serv'd the party;— The self-same things had said and writ, Had Pitt been Fox, and Fox been Pitt; Content his own applause to win, Would never dash thro' thick and thin, And he can make, so say the wise, No claim who makes no sacrifice;— And bard still less:—what claim had he, Who swore it vex'd his soul to see So grand a cause, so proud a realm, With Goose and Goody at the helm; Who long ago had fall'n asunder But for their rivals' baser blunder, The coward whine and Frenchified Slaver and slang of the other side?— Thus, his own whim his only bribe, Our Bard pursued his old A. B. C. Contented if he could subscribe In fullest sense his name ??????; ('Tis Punic Greek for ‘he hath stood!’) Whate'er the men, the cause was good; And therefore with a right good will, Poor fool, he fights their battles still. Tush! squeak'd the Bats;—a mere bravado To whitewash that base renegado; 'Tis plain unless you're blind or mad, His conscience for the bays he barters;— And true it is—as true as sad— These circlets of green baize he had— But then, alas! they were his garters! Ah! silly Bard, unfed, untended, His lamp but glimmer'd in its socket; He lived unhonour'd and unfriended With scarce a penny in his pocket;— Nay—tho' he hid it from the many— With scarce a pocket for his penny! 1825. THE TWO FOUNTS STANZAS ADDRESSED TO A LADY ON HER RECOVERY WITH UNBLEMISHED LOOKS, FROM A SEVERE ATTACK OF PAIN 'Twas my last waking thought, how it could be That thou, sweet friend, such anguish should'st endure; When straight from Dreamland came a Dwarf, and he Could tell the cause, forsooth, and knew the cure. Methought he fronted me with peering look Fix'd on my heart; and read aloud in game The loves and griefs therein, as from a book: And uttered praise like one who wished to blame. In every heart (quoth he) since Adam's sin Two Founts there are, of Suffering and of Cheer! That to let forth, and this to keep within! But she, whose aspect I find imaged here, Of Pleasure only will to all dispense, That Fount alone unlock, by no distress Choked or turned inward, but still issue thence Unconquered cheer, persistent loveliness. As on the driving cloud the shiny bow, That gracious thing made up of tears and light, Mid the wild rack and rain that slants below Stands smiling forth, unmoved and freshly bright; As though the spirits of all lovely flowers, Inweaving each its wreath and dewy crown, Or ere they sank to earth in vernal showers, Had built a bridge to tempt the angels down. Even so, Eliza! on that face of thine, On that benignant face, whose look alone (The soul's translucence thro' her crystal shrine!) Has power to soothe all anguish but thine own, A beauty hovers still, and ne'er takes wing, But with a silent charm compels the stern And tort'ring Genius of the bitter spring, To shrink aback, and cower upon his urn. Who then needs wonder, if (no outlet found In passion, spleen, or strife) the Fount of Pain O'erflowing beats against its lovely mound, And in wild flashes shoots from heart to brain? Sleep, and the Dwarf with that unsteady gleam On his raised lip, that aped a critic smile, Had passed: yet I, my sad thoughts to beguile, Lay weaving on the tissue of my dream; Till audibly at length I cried, as though Thou hadst indeed been present to my eyes, O sweet, sweet sufferer; if the case be so, I pray thee, be less good, less sweet, less wise! In every look a barbéd arrow send, On those soft lips let scorn and anger live! Do any thing, rather than thus, sweet friend! Hoard for thyself the pain, thou wilt not give! 1826. CONSTANCY TO AN IDEAL OBJECT Since all that beat about in Nature's range, Or veer or vanish; why should'st thou remain The only constant in a world of change, O yearning Thought! that liv'st but in the brain? Call to the Hours, that in the distance play, The faery people of the future day— Fond Thought! not one of all that shining swarm Will breathe on thee with life-enkindling breath, Till when, like strangers shelt'ring from a storm, Hope and Despair meet in the porch of Death! Yet still thou haunt'st me; and though well I see, She is not thou, and only thou art she, Still, still as though some dear embodied Good, Some living Love before my eyes there stood With answering look a ready ear to lend, I mourn to thee and say—‘Ah! loveliest friend! That this the meed of all my toils might be, To have a home, an English home, and thee!’ Vain repetition! Home and Thou are one. The peacefull'st cot, the moon shall shine upon, Lulled by the thrush and wakened by the lark, Without thee were but a becalméd bark, Whose Helmsman on an ocean waste and wide Sits mute and pale his mouldering helm beside. And art thou nothing? Such thou art, as when The woodman winding westward up the glen At wintry dawn, where o'er the sheep-track's maze The viewless snow-mist weaves a glist'ning haze, Sees full before him, gliding without tread, An image with a glory round its head; The enamoured rustic worships its fair hues, Nor knows he makes the shadow, he pursues! ?1826. THE PANG MORE SHARP THAN ALL AN ALLEGORY I He too has flitted from his secret nest, Hope's last and dearest child without a name!— Has flitted from me, like the warmthless flame, That makes false promise of a place of rest To the tired Pilgrim's still believing mind;— Or like some Elfin Knight in kingly court, Who having won all guerdons in his sport, Glides out of view, and whither none can find! II Yes! he hath flitted from me—with what aim, Or why, I know not! 'Twas a home of bliss, And he was innocent, as the pretty shame Of babe, that tempts and shuns the menaced kiss, From its twy-cluster'd hiding place of snow! Pure as the babe, I ween, and all aglow As the dear hopes, that swell the mother's breast— Her eyes down gazing o'er her claspéd charge;— Yet gay as that twice happy father's kiss, That well might glance aside, yet never miss, Where the sweet mark emboss'd so sweet a targe— Twice wretched he who hath been doubly blest! III Like a loose blossom on a gusty night He flitted from me—and has left behind (As if to them his faith he ne'er did plight) Of either sex and answerable mind Two playmates, twin-births of his foster-dame:— The one a steady lad (Esteem he hight) And Kindness is the gentler sister's name. Dim likeness now, though fair she be and good, Of that bright Boy who hath us all forsook;— But in his full-eyed aspect when she stood, And while her face reflected every look, And in reflection kindled—she became So like Him, that almost she seem'd the same! IV Ah! he is gone, and yet will not depart!— Is with me still, yet I from him exiled! For still there lives within my secret heart The magic image of the magic Child, Which there he made up-grow by his strong art, As in that crystal orb—wise Merlin's feat,— The wondrous ‘World of Glass,’ wherein inisled All long'd-for things their beings did repeat;— And there he left it, like a Sylph beguiled, To live and yearn and languish incomplete! V Can wit of man a heavier grief reveal? Can sharper pang from hate or scorn arise?— Yes! one more sharp there is that deeper lies, Which fond Esteem but mocks when he would heal. Yet neither scorn nor hate did it devise, But sad compassion and atoning zeal! One pang more blighting-keen than hope betray'd! And this it is my woeful hap to feel, When, at her Brother's hest, the twin-born Maid With face averted and unsteady eyes, Her truant playmate's faded robe puts on; And inly shrinking from her own disguise Enacts the faery Boy that's lost and gone. O worse than all! O pang all pangs above Is Kindness counterfeiting absent Love! ?1825–6. DUTY SURVIVING SELF-LOVE THE ONLY SURE FRIEND OF DECLINING LIFE A SOLILOQUY Unchanged within, to see all changed without, Is a blank lot and hard to bear, no doubt. Yet why at others' wanings should'st thou fret? Then only might'st thou feel a just regret, Hadst thou withheld thy love or hid thy light In solfish forethought of neglect and slight. O wiselier then, from feeble yearnings freed, While, and on whom, thou may'st—shine on! nor heed Whether the object by reflected light Return thy radiance or absorb it quite: And though thou notest from thy safe recess Old Friends burn dim, like lamps in noisome air, Love them for what they are; nor love them less, Because to thee they are not what they were. 1826. HOMELESS ‘O! Christmas Day, Oh! happy day! A foretaste from above, To him who hath a happy home And love returned from love!’ O! Christmas Day, O gloomy day, The barb in Memory's dart, To him who walks alone through Life, The desolate in heart. 1826. LINES SUGGESTED BY THE LAST WORDS OF BERENGARIUS OB. ANNO DOM. 1088 No more 'twixt conscience staggering and the Pope Soon shall I now before my God appear, By him to be acquitted, as I hope; By him to be condemnéd, as I fear.— REFLECTION ON THE ABOVE Lynx amid moles! had I stood by thy bed, Be of good cheer, meek soul! I would have said: I see a hope spring from that humble fear. All are not strong alike through storms to steer Right onward. What? though dread of threatened death And dungeon torture made thy hand and breath Inconstant to the truth within thy heart! That truth, from which, through fear, thou twice didst start, Fear haply told thee, was a learned strife, Or not so vital as to claim thy life: And myriads had reached Heaven, who never knew Where lay the difference 'twixt the false and true! Ye, who secure 'mid trophies not your own, Judge him who won them when he stood alone, And proudly talk of recreant Berengare— O first the age, and then the man compare! That age how dark! congenial minds how rare! No host of friends with kindred zeal did burn! No throbbing hearts awaited his return! Prostrate alike when prince and peasant fell, He only disenchanted from the spell, Like the weak worm that gems the starless night, Moved in the scanty circlet of his light: And was it strange if he withdrew the ray That did but guide the night-birds to their prey? The ascending day-star with a bolder eye Hath lit each dew-drop on our trimmer lawn! Yet not for this, if wise, shall we decry The spots and struggles of the timid Dawn; Lest so we tempt th' approaching Noon to scorn The mists and painted vapours of our Morn. ?1826. EPITAPHIUM TESTAMENTARIUM ?? ??? ?????? ??? ????????? Epitaphium testamentarium ??????????. Quae linquam, aut nihil, aut nihili, aut vix sunt mea. Sordes Do Morti: reddo caetera, Christe! tibi. 1826. ???? ??? ???????? ??????? In many ways does the full heart reveal The presence of the love it would conceal; But in far more th' estrangéd heart lets know The absence of the love, which yet it fain would shew. 1826. THE IMPROVISATORE OR, ‘JOHN ANDERSON, MY JO, JOHN’ Answer, ex improviso The following is a verse reply to a prose dialogue. Yes, yes! that boon, life's richest treat He had, or fancied that he had; Say, 'twas but in his own conceit— The fancy made him glad! Crown of his cup, and garnish of his dish! The boon, prefigured in his earliest wish, The fair fulfilment of his poesy, When his young heart first yearn'd for sympathy! But e'en the meteor offspring of the brain Unnourished wane; Faith asks her daily bread, And Fancy must be fed! Now so it chanced—from wet or dry, It boots not how—I know not why— She missed her wonted food; and quickly Poor Fancy stagger'd and grew sickly. Then came a restless state, 'twixt yea and nay, His faith was fix'd, his heart all ebb and flow; Or like a bark, in some half-shelter'd bay, Above its anchor driving to and fro. That boon, which but to have possess'd In a belief, gave life a zest— Uncertain both what it had been, And if by error lost, or luck; And what it was;—an evergreen Which some insidious blight had struck, Or annual flower, which, past its blow, No vernal spell shall e'er revive; Uncertain, and afraid to know, Doubts toss'd him to and fro: Hope keeping Love, Love Hope alive, Like babes bewildered in a snow, That cling and huddle from the cold In hollow tree or ruin'd fold. Those sparkling colours, once his boast Fading, one by one away, Thin and hueless as a ghost, Poor Fancy on her sick bed lay; Ill at distance, worse when near, Telling her dreams to jealous Fear! Where was it then, the sociable sprite That crown'd the Poet's cup and deck'd his dish! Poor shadow cast from an unsteady wish, Itself a substance by no other right But that it intercepted Reason's light; It dimm'd his eye, it darken'd on his brow, A peevish mood, a tedious time, I trow! Thank Heaven! 'tis not so now. O bliss of blissful hours! The boon of Heaven's decreeing, While yet in Eden's bowers Dwelt the first husband and his sinless mate! The one sweet plant, which, piteous Heaven agreeing, They bore with them thro' Eden's closing gate! Of life's gay summer tide the sovran Rose! Late autumn's Amaranth, that more fragrant blows When Passion's flowers all fall or fade; If this were ever his, in outward being, Or but his own true love's projected shade, Now that at length by certain proof he knows, That whether real or a magic show, Whate'er it was, it is no longer so; Though heart be lonesome, Hope laid low, Yet, Lady! deem him not unblest: The certainty that struck Hope dead, Hath left Contentment in her stead: And that is next to Best! 1827. TO MARY PRIDHAM [AFTERWARDS MRS. DERWENT COLERIDGE] Dear tho' unseen! tho' I have left behind Life's gayer views and all that stirs the mind, Now I revive, Hope making a new start, Since I have heard with most believing heart, That all my glad eyes would grow bright to see, My Derwent hath found realiz'd in thee, The boon prefigur'd in his earliest wish Crown of his cup and garnish of his dish! The fair fulfilment of his poesy, When his young heart first yearn'd for sympathy! Dear tho' unseen! unseen, yet long portray'd! A Father's blessing on thee, gentle Maid! S. T. Coleridge. 16th October 1827. ALICE DU CLOS OR THE FORKED TONGUE A BALLAD ‘One word with two meanings is the traitor's shield and shaft: and a slit tongue be his blazon!’ —Caucasian Proverb. ‘The Sun is not yet risen, But the dawn lies red on the dew: Lord Julian has stolen from the hunters away, Is seeking, Lady! for you. Put on your dress of green, Your buskins and your quiver; Lord Julian is a hasty man, Long waiting brook'd he never. I dare not doubt him, that he means To wed you on a day, Your lord and master for to be, And you his lady gay. O Lady! throw your book aside! I would not that my Lord should chide.’ Thus spake Sir Hugh the vassal knight To Alice, child of old Du Clos, As spotless fair, as airy light As that moon-shiny doe, The gold star on its brow, her sire's ancestral crest! For ere the lark had left his nest, She in the garden bower below Sate loosely wrapt in maiden white, Her face half drooping from the sight, A snow-drop on a tuft of snow! O close your eyes, and strive to see The studious maid, with book on knee,— Ah! earliest-open'd flower; While yet with keen unblunted light The morning star shone opposite The lattice of her bower— Alone of all the starry host, As if in prideful scorn Of flight and fear he stay'd behind, To brave th' advancing morn. O! Alice could read passing well, And she was conning then Dan Ovid's mazy tale of loves, And gods, and beasts, and men. The vassal's speech, his taunting vein, It thrill'd like venom thro' her brain; Yet never from the book She rais'd her head, nor did she deign The knight a single look. ‘Off, traitor friend! how dar'st thou fix Thy wanton gaze on me? And why, against my earnest suit, Does Julian send by thee? ‘Go, tell thy Lord, that slow is sure: Fair speed his shafts to-day! I follow here a stronger lure, And chase a gentler prey.’ She said: and with a baleful smile The vassal knight reel'd off— Like a huge billow from a bark Toil'd in the deep sea-trough, That shouldering sideways in mid plunge, Is travers'd by a flash. And staggering onward, leaves the ear With dull and distant crash. And Alice sate with troubled mien A moment; for the scoff was keen, And thro' her veins did shiver! Then rose and donn'd her dress of green, Her buskins and her quiver. There stands the flow'ring may-thorn tree! From thro' the veiling mist you see The black and shadowy stem;— Smit by the sun the mist in glee Dissolves to lightsome jewelry— Each blossom hath its gem! With tear-drop glittering to a smile, The gay maid on the garden-stile Mimics the hunter's shout. ‘Hip! Florian, hip! To horse, to horse! Go, bring the palfrey out. ‘My Julian's out with all his clan, And, bonny boy, you wis, Lord Julian is a hasty man, Who comes late, comes amiss.’ Now Florian was a stripling squire, A gallant boy of Spain, That toss'd his head in joy and pride, Behind his Lady fair to ride, But blush'd to hold her train. The huntress is in her dress of green,— And forth they go; she with her bow, Her buskins and her quiver!— The squire—no younger e'er was seen— With restless arm and laughing een, He makes his javelin quiver. And had not Ellen stay'd the race, And stopp'd to see, a moment's space, The whole great globe of light Give the last parting kiss-like touch To the eastern ridge, it lack'd not much, They had o'erta'en the knight. It chanced that up the covert lane, Where Julian waiting stood, A neighbour knight prick'd on to join The huntsmen in the wood. And with him must Lord Julian go, Tho' with an anger'd mind: Betroth'd not wedded to his bride, In vain he sought, 'twixt shame and pride, Excuse to stay behind. He bit his lip, he wrung his glove, He look'd around, he look'd above, But pretext none could find or frame. Alas! alas! and well-a-day! It grieves me sore to think, to say, That names so seldom meet with Love, Yet Love wants courage without a name! Straight from the forest's skirt the trees O'er-branching, made an aisle, Where hermit old might pace and chaunt As in a minster's pile. From underneath its leafy screen, And from the twilight shade, You pass at once into a green, A green and lightsome glade. And there Lord Julian sate on steed; Behind him, in a round, Stood knight and squire, and menial train; Against the leash the greyhounds strain; The horses paw'd the ground. When up the alley green, Sir Hugh Spurr'd in upon the sward, And mute, without a word, did he Fall in behind his lord. Lord Julian turn'd his steed half round,— ‘What! doth not Alice deign To accept your loving convoy, knight? Or doth she fear our woodland sleight, And join us on the plain?’ With stifled tones the knight replied, And look'd askance on either side,— ‘Nay, let the hunt proceed!— The Lady's message that I bear, I guess would scantly please your ear, And less deserves your heed. ‘You sent betimes. Not yet unbarr'd I found the middle door;— Two stirrers only met my eyes, Fair Alice, and one more. ‘I came unlook'd for; and, it seem'd, In an unwelcome hour; And found the daughter of Du Clos Within the lattic'd bower. ‘But hush! the rest may wait. If lost, No great loss, I divine; And idle words will better suit A fair maid's lips than mine.’ ‘God's wrath! speak out, man,’ Julian cried, O'ermaster'd by the sudden smart;— And feigning wrath, sharp, blunt, and rude, The knight his subtle shift pursued.— ‘Scowl not at me; command my skill, To lure your hawk back, if you will, But not a woman's heart. ‘“Go! (said she) tell him,—slow is sure; Fair speed his shafts to-day! I follow here a stronger lure, And chase a gentler prey.” ‘The game, pardie, was full in sight, That then did, if I saw aright, The fair dame's eyes engage; For turning, as I took my ways, I saw them fix'd with steadfast gaze Full on her wanton page.’ The last word of the traitor knight It had but entered Julian's ear,— From two o'erarching oaks between, With glist'ning helm-like cap is seen, Borne on in giddy cheer, A youth, that ill his steed can guide; Yet with reverted face doth ride, As answering to a voice, That seems at once to laugh and chide— ‘Not mine, dear mistress,’ still he cried, ‘'Tis this mad filly's choice.’ With sudden bound, beyond the boy, See! see! that face of hope and joy, That regal front! those cheeks aglow! Thou needed'st but the crescent sheen, A quiver'd Dian to have been, Thou lovely child of old Du Clos! Dark as a dream Lord Julian stood, Swift as a dream, from forth the wood, Sprang on the plighted Maid! With fatal aim, and frantic force, The shaft was hurl'd!—a lifeless corse, Fair Alice from her vaulting horse, Lies bleeding on the glade. ?1828. LOVE'S BURIAL-PLACE Lady. If Love be dead— Poet. And I aver it! Lady. Tell me, Bard! where Love lies buried? Poet. Love lies buried where 'twas born: Oh, gentle dame! think it no scorn If, in my fancy, I presume To call thy bosom poor Love's Tomb. And on that tomb to read the line:— ‘Here lies a Love that once seem'd mine, But caught a chill, as I divine, And died at length of a Decline.’ 1828. LINES TO A COMIC AUTHOR, ON AN ABUSIVE REVIEW What though the chilly wide-mouth'd quacking chorus From the rank swamps of murk Review-land croak: So was it, neighbour, in the times before us, When Momus, throwing on his Attic cloak, Romp'd with the Graces; and each tickled Muse (That Turk, Dan Phœbus, whom bards call divine, Was married to—at least, he kept—all nine) Fled, but still with reverted faces ran; Yet, somewhat the broad freedoms to excuse, They had allured the audacious Greek to use, Swore they mistook him for their own good man. This Momus—Aristophanes on earth Men call'd him—maugre all his wit and worth, Was croak'd and gabbled at. How, then, should you, Or I, friend, hope to 'scape the skulking crew? No! laugh, and say aloud, in tones of glee, ‘I hate the quacking tribe, and they hate me!’ ?1825. COLOGNE In Köhln, a town of monks and bones, And pavements fang'd with murderous stones And rags, and hags, and hideous wenches; I counted two and seventy stenches, All well defined, and several stinks! Ye Nymphs that reign o'er sewers and sinks, The river Rhine, it is well known, Doth wash your city of Cologne; But tell me, Nymphs, what power divine Shall henceforth wash the river Rhine? 1828. ON MY JOYFUL DEPARTURE FROM THE SAME CITY As I am a Rhymer, And now at least a merry one, Mr. Mum's Rudesheimer And the church of St. Geryon Are the two things alone That deserve to be known In the body-and-soul-stinking town of Cologne. 1828. THE GARDEN OF BOCCACCIO Of late, in one of those most weary hours, When life seems emptied of all genial powers, A dreary mood, which he who ne'er has known May bless his happy lot, I sate alone; And, from the numbing spell to win relief, Call'd on the Past for thought of glee or grief. In vain! bereft alike of grief and glee, I sate and cow'r'd o'er my own vacancy! And as I watch'd the dull continuous ache, Which, all else slumb'ring, seem'd alone to wake; O Friend! long wont to notice yet conceal, And soothe by silence what words cannot heal, I but half saw that quiet hand of thine Place on my desk this exquisite design. Boccaccio's Garden and its faery, The love, the joyaunce, and the gallantry! An Idyll, with Boccaccio's spirit warm, Framed in the silent poesy of form. Like flocks adown a newly-bathéd steep Emerging from a mist: or like a stream Of music soft that not dispels the sleep, But casts in happier moulds the slumberer's dream, Gazed by an idle eye with silent might The picture stole upon my inward sight. A tremulous warmth crept gradual o'er my chest, As though an infant's finger touch'd my breast. And one by one (I know not whence) were brought All spirits of power that most had stirr'd my thought In selfless boyhood, on a new world tost Of wonder, and in its own fancies lost; Or charm'd my youth, that, kindled from above, Loved ere it loved, and sought a form for love; Or lent a lustre to the earnest scan Of manhood, musing what and whence is man! Wild strain of Scalds, that in the sea-worn caves Rehearsed their war-spell to the winds and waves; Or fateful hymn of those prophetic maids, That call'd on Hertha in deep forest glades; Or minstrel lay, that cheer'd the baron's feast; Or rhyme of city pomp, of monk and priest, Judge, mayor, and many a guild in long array, To high-church pacing on the great saint's day: And many a verse which to myself I sang, That woke the tear, yet stole away the pang Of hopes, which in lamenting I renew'd: And last, a matron now, of sober mien, Yet radiant still and with no earthly sheen, Whom as a faery child my childhood woo'd Even in my dawn of thought—Philosophy; Though then unconscious of herself, pardie, She bore no other name than Poesy; And, like a gift from heaven, in lifeful glee, That had but newly left a mother's knee, Prattled and play'd with bird and flower, and stone, As if with elfin playfellows well known, And life reveal'd to innocence alone. Thanks, gentle artist! now I can descry Thy fair creation with a mastering eye, And all awake! And now in fix'd gaze stand, Now wander through the Eden of thy hand; Praise the green arches, on the fountain clear See fragment shadows of the crossing deer; And with that serviceable nymph I stoop, The crystal, from its restless pool, to scoop. I see no longer! I myself am there, Sit on the ground-sward, and the banquet share. 'Tis I, that sweep that lute's love-echoing strings, And gaze upon the maid who gazing sings: Or pause and listen to the tinkling bells From the high tower, and think that there she dwells. With old Boccaccio's soul I stand possest, And breathe an air like life, that swells my chest. The brightness of the world, O thou once free, And always fair, rare land of courtesy! O Florence! with the Tuscan fields and hills And famous Arno, fed with all their rills; Thou brightest star of star-bright Italy! Rich, ornate, populous,—all treasures thine, The golden corn, the olive, and the vine. Fair cities, gallant mansions, castles old, And forests, where beside his leafy hold The sullen boar hath heard the distant horn, And whets his tusks against the gnarléd thorn; Palladian palace with its storied halls; Fountains, where Love lies listening to their falls; Gardens, where flings the bridge its airy span, And Nature makes her happy home with man; Where many a gorgeous flower is duly fed With its own rill, on its own spangled bed, And wreathes the marble urn, or leans its head, A mimic mourner, that with veil withdrawn Weeps liquid gems, the presents of the dawn;— Thine all delights, and every muse is thine; And more than all, the embrace and intertwine Of all with all in gay and twinkling dance! Mid gods of Greece and warriors of romance, See! Boccace sits, unfolding on his knees The new-found roll of old Maeonides; But from his mantle's fold, and near the heart, Peers Ovid's Holy Book of Love's sweet smart! O all-enjoying and all-blending sage, Long be it mine to con thy mazy page, Where, half conceal'd, the eye of fancy views Fauns, nymphs, and wingéd saints, all gracious to thy muse! Still in thy garden let me watch their pranks, And see in Dian's vest between the ranks Of the trim vines, some maid that half believes The vestal fires, of which her lover grieves, With that sly satyr peeping through the leaves! 1828. LOVE, HOPE, AND PATIENCE IN EDUCATION O'er wayward childhood would'st thou hold firm rule, And sun thee in the light of happy faces; Love, Hope, and Patience, these must be thy graces, And in thine own heart let them first keep school. For as old Atlas on his broad neck places Heaven's starry globe, and there sustains it;—so Do these upbear the little world below Of Education,—Patience, Love, and Hope. Methinks, I see them group'd in seemly show, The straiten'd arms upraised, the palms aslope, And robes that touching as adown they flow, Distinctly blend, like snow emboss'd in snow. O part them never! If Hope prostrate lie, Love too will sink and die. But Love is subtle, and doth proof derive From her own life that Hope is yet alive; And bending o'er, with soul-transfusing eyes, And the soft murmurs of the mother dove, Woos back the fleeting spirit, and half supplies;— Thus Love repays to Hope what Hope first gave to Love. Yet haply there will come a weary day, When overtask'd at length Both Love and Hope beneath the load give way. Then with a statue's smile, a statue's strength, Stands the mute sister, Patience, nothing loth, And both supporting does the work of both. 1829. TO MISS A. T. Verse, pictures, music, thoughts both grave and gay, Remembrances of dear-loved friends away, On spotless page of virgin white displayed, Such should thine Album be, for such art thou, sweet maid! 1829. LINES WRITTEN IN COMMONPLACE BOOK OF MISS BARBOUR, DAUGHTER OF THE MINISTER OF THE U.S.A. TO ENGLAND Child of my muse! in Barbour's gentle hand Go cross the main: thou seek'st no foreign land: 'Tis not the clod beneath our feet we name Our country. Each heaven-sanctioned tie the same, Laws, manners, language, faith, ancestral blood, Domestic honour, awe of womanhood:— With kindling pride thou wilt rejoice to see Britain with elbow-room and doubly free! Go seek thy countrymen! and if one scar Still linger of that fratricidal war, Look to the maid who brings thee from afar; Be thou the olive-leaf and she the dove, And say, I greet thee with a brother's love! S. T. Coleridge. Grove, Highgate, August 1829. SONG, ex improviso ON HEARING A SONG IN PRAISE OF A LADY'S BEAUTY 'Tis not the lily-brow I prize, Nor roseate cheeks, nor sunny eyes, Enough of lilies and of roses! A thousand-fold more dear to me The gentle look that Love discloses,— The look that Love alone can see! Keepsake, 1830. LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP OPPOSITE Her attachment may differ from yours in degree, Provided they are both of one kind; But Friendship, how tender so ever it be, Gives no accord to Love, however refined. Love, that meets not with Love, its true nature revealing, Grows ashamed of itself, and demurs: If you cannot lift hers up to your state of feeling, You must lower down your state to hers. ?1830. NOT AT HOME That Jealousy may rule a mind Where Love could never be I know; but ne'er expect to find Love without Jealousy. She has a strange cast in her ee, A swart sour-visaged maid— But yet Love's own twin-sister she His house-mate and his shade. Ask for her and she'll be denied:— What then? they only mean Their mistress has lain down to sleep, And can't just then be seen. ?1830. PHANTOM OR FACT A DIALOGUE IN VERSE AUTHOR A lovely form there sate beside my bed, And such a feeding calm its presence shed, A tender love so pure from earthly leaven, That I unnethe the fancy might control, 'Twas my own spirit newly come from heaven, Wooing its gentle way into my soul! But ah! the change—It had not stirr'd, and yet— Alas! that change how fain would I forget! That shrinking back, like one that had mistook! That weary, wandering, disavowing look! 'Twas all another, feature, look, and frame, And still, methought, I knew, it was the same! FRIEND This riddling tale, to what does it belong? Is't history? vision? or an idle song? Or rather say at once, within what space Of time this wild disastrous change took place? AUTHOR Call it a moment's work (and such it seems) This tale's a fragment from the life of dreams; But say, that years matur'd the silent strife, And 'tis a record from the dream of life. ?1830. DESIRE Where true Love burns Desire is Love's pure flame; It is the reflex of our earthly frame, That takes its meaning from the nobler part, And but translates the language of the heart. ?1830. CHARITY IN THOUGHT To praise men as good, and to take them for such, Is a grace which no soul can mete out to a tittle;— Of which he who has not a little too much, Will by Charity's gauge surely have much too little. ?1830. HUMILITY THE MOTHER OF CHARITY Frail creatures are we all! To be the best, Is but the fewest faults to have:— Look thou then to thyself, and leave the rest To God, thy conscience, and the grave. ?1830. [COELI ENARRANT] The stars that wont to start, as on a chace, Mid twinkling insult on Heaven's darken'd face, Like a conven'd conspiracy of spies Wink at each other with confiding eyes! Turn from the portent—all is blank on high, No constellations alphabet the sky: The Heavens one large Black Letter only shew, And as a child beneath its master's blow Shrills out at once its task and its affright— The groaning world now learns to read aright, And with its Voice of Voices cries out, O! ?1830. REASON [‘Finally, what is Reason? You have often asked me: and this is my answer’:—] Whene'er the mist, that stands 'twixt God and thee, Defecates to a pure transparency, That intercepts no light and adds no stain— There Reason is, and then begins her reign! But alas! — ‘tu stesso, ti fai grosso Col falso immaginar, sì che non vedi Ciò che vedresti, se l'avessi scosso.’ Dante, Paradiso, Canto i. 1830. SELF-KNOWLEDGE —E coelo descendit ????? ???????. —Juvenal, xi. 27. ????? ???????!—and is this the prime And heaven-sprung adage of the olden time!— Say, canst thou make thyself?—Learn first that trade;— Haply thou mayst know what thyself had made. What hast thou, Man, that thou dar'st call thine own?— What is there in thee, Man, that can be known?— Dark fluxion, all unfixable by thought, A phantom dim of past and future wrought, Vain sister of the worm,—life, death, soul, clod— Ignore thyself, and strive to know thy God! 1832. FORBEARANCE Beareth all things. —1 Cor. xiii. 7. Gently I took that which ungently came, And without scorn forgave:—Do thou the same. A wrong done to thee think a cat's-eye spark Thou wouldst not see, were not thine own heart dark. Thine own keen sense of wrong that thirsts for sin, Fear that—the spark self-kindled from within, Which blown upon will blind thee with its glare, Or smother'd stifle thee with noisome air. Clap on the extinguisher, pull up the blinds, And soon the ventilated spirit finds Its natural daylight. If a foe have kenn'd, Or worse than foe, an alienated friend, A rib of dry rot in thy ship's stout side, Think it God's message, and in humble pride With heart of oak replace it;—thine the gains— Give him the rotten timber for his pains! ?1832. LOVE'S APPARITION AND EVANISHMENT AN ALLEGORIC ROMANCE Like a lone Arab, old and blind, Some caravan had left behind, Who sits beside a ruin'd well, Where the shy sand-asps bask and swell; And now he hangs his agéd head aslant, And listens for a human sound—in vain! And now the aid, which Heaven alone can grant, Upturns his eyeless face from Heaven to gain;— Even thus, in vacant mood, one sultry hour, Resting my eye upon a drooping plant, With brow low-bent, within my garden-bower, I sate upon the couch of camomile; And—whether 'twas a transient sleep, perchance, Flitted across the idle brain, the while I watch'd the sickly calm with aimless scope, In my own heart; or that, indeed a trance, Turn'd my eye inward—thee, O genial Hope, Love's elder sister! thee did I behold, Drest as a bridesmaid, but all pale and cold, With roseless cheek, all pale and cold and dim, Lie lifeless at my feet! And then came Love, a sylph in bridal trim, And stood beside my seat; She bent, and kiss'd her sister's lips, As she was wont to do;— Alas! 'twas but a chilling breath Woke just enough of life in death To make Hope die anew. L'ENVOY In vain we supplicate the Powers above; There is no resurrection for the Love That, nursed in tenderest care, yet fades away In the chill'd heart by gradual self-decay. 1833. TO THE YOUNG ARTIST KAYSER OF KASERWERTH Kayser! to whom, as to a second self, Nature, or Nature's next-of-kin, the Elf, Hight Genius, hath dispensed the happy skill To cheer or soothe the parting friend's ‘Alas!’ Turning the blank scroll to a magic glass, That makes the absent present at our will; And to the shadowing of thy pencil gives Such seeming substance, that it almost lives. Well hast thou given the thoughtful Poet's face! Yet hast thou on the tablet of his mind A more delightful portrait left behind— Even thy own youthful beauty, and artless grace, Thy natural gladness and eyes bright with glee! Kayser! farewell! Be wise! be happy! and forget not me. 1833. MY BAPTISMAL BIRTH-DAY God's child in Christ adopted,—Christ my all,— What that earth boasts were not lost cheaply, rather Than forfeit that blest name, by which I call The Holy One, the Almighty God, my Father?— Father! in Christ we live, and Christ in Thee— Eternal Thou, and everlasting we. The heir of heaven, henceforth I fear not death: In Christ I live! in Christ I draw the breath Of the true life!—Let then earth, sea, and sky Make war against me! On my heart I show Their mighty master's seal. In vain they try To end my life, that can but end its woe.— Is that a death-bed where a Christian lies?— Yes! but not his—'tis Death itself there dies. 1833. EPITAPH Stop, Christian passer-by!—Stop, child of God, And read with gentle breast. Beneath this sod A poet lies, or that which once seem'd he. O, lift one thought in prayer for S. T. C.; That he who many a year with toil of breath Found death in life, may here find life in death! Mercy for praise—to be forgiven for fame He ask'd, and hoped, through Christ. Do thou the same! 9th November, 1833.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II: DRAMATIC WORKS AND APPENDICES DRAMATIC WORKS THE FALL OF ROBESPIERRE AN HISTORIC DRAMA [First Act by Coleridge: Second and Third by Southey—1794.] TO H. MARTIN, ESQ. OF JESUS COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE Dear Sir, Accept, as a small testimony of my grateful attachment, the following Dramatic Poem, in which I have endeavoured to detail, in an interesting form, the fall of a man, whose great bad actions have cast a disastrous lustre on his name. In the execution of the work, as intricacy of plot could not have been attempted without a gross violation of recent facts, it has been my sole aim to imitate the empassioned and highly figurative language of the French orators, and to develope the characters of the chief actors on a vast stage of horrors. Yours fraternally, S. T. Coleridge. Jesus College, September 22, 1794. ACT I Scene —The Thuilleries. Barrere. The tempest gathers—be it mine to seek A friendly shelter, ere it bursts upon him. But where? and how? I fear the Tyrant's soul— Sudden in action, fertile in resource, And rising awful 'mid impending ruins; In splendor gloomy, as the midnight meteor, That fearless thwarts the elemental war. When last in secret conference we met, He scowl'd upon me with suspicious rage, Making his eye the inmate of my bosom. I know he scorns me—and I feel, I hate him— Yet there is in him that which makes me tremble! [Exit. Enter Tallien and Legendre. Tallien. It was Barrere, Legendre! didst thou mark him? Abrupt he turn'd, yet linger'd as he went, And towards us cast a look of doubtful meaning. Legendre. I mark'd him well. I met his eye's last glance; It menac'd not so proudly as of yore. Methought he would have spoke—but that he dar'd not— Such agitation darken'd on his brow. Tallien. 'Twas all-distrusting guilt that kept from bursting Th' imprison'd secret struggling in the face: E'en as the sudden breeze upstarting onwards Hurries the thundercloud, that pois'd awhile Hung in mid air, red with its mutinous burthen. Legendre. Perfidious Traitor!—still afraid to bask In the full blaze of power, the rustling serpent Lurks in the thicket of the Tyrant's greatness, Ever prepared to sting who shelters him. Each thought, each action in himself converges; And love and friendship on his coward heart Shine like the powerless sun on polar ice; To all attach'd, by turns deserting all, Cunning and dark—a necessary villain! Tallien. Yet much depends upon him—well you know With plausible harangue 'tis his to paint Defeat like victory—and blind the mob With truth-mix'd falsehood. They led on by him, And wild of head to work their own destruction, Support with uproar what he plans in darkness. Legendre. O what a precious name is Liberty To scare or cheat the simple into slaves! Yes—we must gain him over: by dark hints We'll shew enough to rouse his watchful fears, Till the cold coward blaze a patriot. O Danton! murder'd friend! assist my counsels— Hover around me on sad Memory's wings, And pour thy daring vengeance in my heart. Tallien! if but to-morrow's fateful sun Beholds the Tyrant living—we are dead! Tallien. Yet his keen eye that flashes mighty meanings— Legendre. Fear not—or rather fear th' alternative, And seek for courage e'en in cowardice— But see—hither he comes—let us away! His brother with him, and the bloody Couthon, And high of haughty spirit, young St. Just. [Exeunt. Enter Robespierre, Couthon, St. Just, and Robespierre Junior. Robespierre. What? did La Fayette fall before my power? And did I conquer Roland's spotless virtues? The fervent eloquence of Vergniaud's tongue? And Brissot's thoughtful soul unbribed and bold? Did zealot armies haste in vain to save them? What! did th' assassin's dagger aim its point Vain, as a dream of murder, at my bosom? And shall I dread the soft luxurious Tallien? Th' Adonis Tallien? banquet-hunting Tallien? Him, whose heart flutters at the dice-box? Him, Who ever on the harlots' downy pillow Resigns his head impure to feverish slumbers! St. Just. I cannot fear him—yet we must not scorn him. Was it not Antony that conquer'd Brutus, Th' Adonis, banquet-hunting Antony? The state is not yet purified: and though The stream runs clear, yet at the bottom lies The thick black sediment of all the factions— It needs no magic hand to stir it up! Couthon. O we did wrong to spare them—fatal error! Why lived Legendre, when that Danton died? And Collot d'Herbois dangerous in crimes? I've fear'd him, since his iron heart endured To make of Lyons one vast human shambles, Compar'd with which the sun-scorcht wilderness Of Zara were a smiling paradise. St. Just. Rightly thou judgest, Couthon! He is one Who flies from silent solitary anguish, Seeking forgetful peace amid the jar Of elements. The howl of maniac uproar Lulls to sad sleep the memory of himself. A calm is fatal to him—then he feels The dire upboilings of the storm within him. A tiger mad with inward wounds!—I dread The fierce and restless turbulence of guilt. Robespierre. Is not the Commune ours? The stern tribunal? Dumas? and Vivier? Fleuriot? and Louvet? And Henriot? We'll denounce an hundred, nor Shall they behold to-morrow's sun roll westward. Robespierre Junior. Nay—I am sick of blood; my aching heart Reviews the long, long train of hideous horrors That still have gloom'd the rise of the Republic. I should have died before Toulon, when war Became the patriot! Robespierre. Most unworthy wish! He, whose heart sickens at the blood of traitors, Would be himself a traitor, were he not A coward! 'Tis congenial souls alone Shed tears of sorrow for each other's fate. O thou art brave, my brother! and thine eye Full firmly shines amid the groaning battle— Yet in thine heart the woman-form of pity Asserts too large a share, an ill-timed guest! There is unsoundness in the state—To-morrow Shall see it cleans'd by wholesome massacre! Robespierre Junior. Beware! already do the sections murmur— ‘O the great glorious patriot, Robespierre— The tyrant guardian of the country's freedom!’ Couthon. 'Twere folly sure to work great deeds by halves! Much I suspect the darksome fickle heart Of cold Barrere! Robespierre. I see the villain in him! Robespierre Junior. If he—if all forsake thee—what remains? Robespierre. Myself! the steel-strong Rectitude of soul And Poverty sublime 'mid circling virtues! The giant Victories my counsels form'd Shall stalk around me with sun-glittering plumes, Bidding the darts of calumny fall pointless. [Exeunt caeteri. Manet Couthon. Couthon (solus). So we deceive ourselves! What goodly virtues Bloom on the poisonous branches of ambition! Still, Robespierre! thou'lt guard thy country's freedom To despotize in all the patriot's pomp. While Conscience, 'mid the mob's applauding clamours, Sleeps in thine ear, nor whispers—blood-stain'd tyrant! Yet what is Conscience? Superstition's dream, Making such deep impression on our sleep— That long th' awakened breast retains its horrors! But he returns—and with him comes Barrere. [Exit Couthon. Enter Robespierre and Barrere. Robespierre. There is no danger but in cowardice.— Barrere! we make the danger, when we fear it. We have such force without, as will suspend The cold and trembling treachery of these members. Barrere. 'Twill be a pause of terror.— Robespierre. But to whom? Rather the short-lived slumber of the tempest, Gathering its strength anew. The dastard traitors! Moles, that would undermine the rooted oak! A pause!—a moment's pause?—'Tis all their life. Barrere. Yet much they talk—and plausible their speech. Couthon's decree has given such powers, that— Robespierre. That what? Barrere. The freedom of debate— Robespierre. Transparent mask! They wish to clog the wheels of government, Forcing the hand that guides the vast machine To bribe them to their duty—English patriots! Are not the congregated clouds of war Black all around us? In our very vitals Works not the king-bred poison of rebellion? Say, what shall counteract the selfish plottings Of wretches, cold of heart, nor awed by fears Of him, whose power directs th' eternal justice? Terror? or secret-sapping gold? The first Heavy, but transient as the ills that cause it; And to the virtuous patriot rendered light By the necessities that gave it birth: The other fouls the fount of the republic, Making it flow polluted to all ages: Inoculates the state with a slow venom, That once imbibed, must be continued ever. Myself incorruptible I ne'er could bribe them— Therefore they hate me. Barrere. Are the sections friendly? Robespierre. There are who wish my ruin—but I'll make them Blush for the crime in blood! Barrere. Nay—but I tell thee, Thou art too fond of slaughter—and the right (If right it be) workest by most foul means! Robespierre. Self-centering Fear! how well thou canst ape Mercy! Too fond of slaughter!—matchless hypocrite! Thought Barrere so, when Brissot, Danton died? Thought Barrere so, when through the streaming streets Of Paris red-eyed Massacre o'erwearied Reel'd heavily, intoxicate with blood? And when (O heavens!) in Lyons' death-red square Sick Fancy groan'd o'er putrid hills of slain, Didst thou not fiercely laugh, and bless the day? Why, thou hast been the mouth-piece of all horrors, And, like a blood-hound, crouch'd for murder! Now Aloof thou standest from the tottering pillar, Or, like a frighted child behind its mother, Hidest thy pale face in the skirts of—Mercy! Barrere. O prodigality of eloquent anger! Why now I see thou'rt weak—thy case is desperate! The cool ferocious Robespierre turn'd scolder! Robespierre. Who from a bad man's bosom wards the blow Reserves the whetted dagger for his own. Denouncéd twice—and twice I saved his life! [Exit. Barrere. The sections will support them—there's the point! No! he can never weather out the storm— Yet he is sudden in revenge—No more! I must away to Tallien. [Exit. Scene changes to the house of Adelaide. Adelaide enters, speaking to a Servant. Adelaide. Didst thou present the letter that I gave thee? Did Tallien answer, he would soon return? Servant. He is in the Thuilleries—with him Legendre— In deep discourse they seem'd: as I approach'd He waved his hand as bidding me retire: I did not interrupt him. [Returns the letter. Adelaide. Thou didst rightly. [Exit Servant. O this new freedom! at how dear a price We've bought the seeming good! The peaceful virtues And every blandishment of private life, The father's cares, the mother's fond endearment, All sacrificed to liberty's wild riot. The wingéd hours, that scatter'd roses round me, Languid and sad drag their slow course along, And shake big gall-drops from their heavy wings. But I will steal away these anxious thoughts By the soft languishment of warbled airs, If haply melodies may lull the sense Of sorrow for a while. [Soft music. Enter Tallien. Tallien. Music, my love? O breathe again that air! Soft nurse of pain, it sooths the weary soul Of care, sweet as the whisper'd breeze of evening That plays around the sick man's throbbing temples. SONG Tell me, on what holy ground May domestic peace be found? Halcyon daughter of the skies, Far on fearful wing she flies, From the pomp of scepter'd state, From the rebel's noisy hate. In a cottag'd vale she dwells List'ning to the Sabbath bells! Still around her steps are seen, Spotless honor's meeker mien, Love, the sire of pleasing fears, Sorrow smiling through her tears, And conscious of the past employ, Memory, bosom-spring of joy. Tallien. I thank thee, Adelaide! 'twas sweet, though mournful. But why thy brow o'ercast, thy cheek so wan? Thou look'st as a lorn maid beside some stream That sighs away the soul in fond despairing, While sorrow sad, like the dank willow near her, Hangs o'er the troubled fountain of her eye. Adelaide. Ah! rather let me ask what mystery lowers On Tallien's darken'd brow. Thou dost me wrong— Thy soul distemper'd, can my heart be tranquil? Tallien. Tell me, by whom thy brother's blood was spilt? Asks he not vengeance on these patriot murderers? It has been borne too tamely. Fears and curses Groan on our midnight beds, and e'en our dreams Threaten the assassin hand of Robespierre. He dies!—nor has the plot escaped his fears. Adelaide. Yet—yet—be cautious! much I fear the Commune— The tyrant's creatures, and their fate with his Fast link'd in close indissoluble union. The pale Convention— Tallien. Hate him as they fear him, Impatient of the chain, resolv'd and ready. Adelaide. Th' enthusiast mob, confusion's lawless sons— Tallien. They are aweary of his stern morality, The fair-mask'd offspring of ferocious pride. The sections too support the delegates: All—all is ours! e'en now the vital air Of Liberty, condens'd awhile, is bursting (Force irresistible!) from its compressure— To shatter the arch chemist in the explosion! Enter Billaud Varennes and Bourdon l'Oise. [Adelaide retires. Bourdon l'Oise. Tallien! was this a time for amorous conference? Henriot, the tyrant's most devoted creature, Marshals the force of Paris: The fierce Club, With Vivier at their head, in loud acclaim Have sworn to make the guillotine in blood Float on the scaffold.—But who comes here? Enter Barrere abruptly. Barrere. Say, are ye friends to freedom? I am her's! Let us, forgetful of all common feuds, Rally around her shrine! E'en now the tyrant Concerts a plan of instant massacre! Billaud Varennes. Away to the Convention! with that voice So oft the herald of glad victory, Rouse their fallen spirits, thunder in their ears The names of tyrant, plunderer, assassin! The violent workings of my soul within Anticipate the monster's blood! [Cry from the street of—No Tyrant! Down with the Tyrant! Tallien. Hear ye that outcry?—If the trembling members Even for a moment hold his fate suspended, I swear by the holy poniard, that stabbed Caesar, This dagger probes his heart! [Exeunt omnes. ACT II Scene —The Convention. Robespierre mounts the Tribune. Once more befits it that the voice of Truth, Fearless in innocence, though leaguered round By Envy and her hateful brood of hell, Be heard amid this hall; once more befits The patriot, whose prophetic eye so oft Has pierced thro' faction's veil, to flash on crimes Of deadliest import. Mouldering in the grave Sleeps Capet's caitiff corse; my daring hand Levelled to earth his blood-cemented throne, My voice declared his guilt, and stirred up France To call for vengeance. I too dug the grave Where sleep the Girondists, detested band! Long with the shew of freedom they abused Her ardent sons. Long time the well-turn'd phrase, The high-fraught sentence and the lofty tone Of declamation, thunder'd in this hall, Till reason midst a labyrinth of words Perplex'd, in silence seem'd to yield assent. I durst oppose. Soul of my honoured friend, Spirit of Marat, upon thee I call— Thou know'st me faithful, know'st with what warm zeal I urg'd the cause of justice, stripp'd the mask From faction's deadly visage, and destroy'd Her traitor brood. Whose patriot arm hurl'd down Hébert and Rousin, and the villain friends Of Danton, foul apostate! those, who long Mask'd treason's form in liberty's fair garb, Long deluged France with blood, and durst defy Omnipotence! but I it seems am false! I am a traitor too! I—Robespierre! I—at whose name the dastard despot brood Look pale with fear, and call on saints to help them! Who dares accuse me? who shall dare belie My spotless name? Speak, ye accomplice band, Of what am I accus'd? of what strange crime Is Maximilian Robespierre accus'd, That through this hall the buz of discontent Should murmur? who shall speak? Billaud Varennes. O patriot tongue Belying the foul heart! Who was it urg'd Friendly to tyrants that accurst decree, Whose influence brooding o'er this hallowed hall, Has chill'd each tongue to silence? Who destroyed The freedom of debate, and carried through The fatal law, that doom'd the delegates, Unheard before their equals, to the bar Where cruelty sat throned, and murder reign'd With her Dumas coequal? Say—thou man Of mighty eloquence, whose law was that? Couthon. That law was mine. I urged it—I propos'd— The voice of France assembled in her sons Assented, though the tame and timid voice Of traitors murmur'd. I advis'd that law— I justify it. It was wise and good. Barrere. Oh, wonderous wise and most convenient too! I have long mark'd thee, Robespierre—and now Proclaim thee traitor—tyrant! [Loud applauses. Robespierre. It is well. I am a traitor! oh, that I had fallen When Regnault lifted high the murderous knife, Regnault the instrument belike of those Who now themselves would fain assassinate, And legalise their murders. I stand here An isolated patriot—hemmed around By faction's noisy pack; beset and bay'd By the foul hell-hounds who know no escape From Justice' outstretch'd arm, but by the force That pierces through her breast. [Murmurs, and shouts of—Down with the Tyrant! Robespierre. Nay, but I will be heard. There was a time When Robespierre began, the loud applauses Of honest patriots drown'd the honest sound. But times are chang'd, and villainy prevails. Collot d'Herbois. No—villainy shall fall. France could not brook A monarch's sway—sounds the dictator's name More soothing to her ear? Bourdon l'Oise. Rattle her chains More musically now than when the hand Of Brissot forged her fetters; or the crew Of Hébert thundered out their blasphemies, And Danton talk'd of virtue? Robespierre. Oh, that Brissot Were here again to thunder in this hall, That Hébert lived, and Danton's giant form Scowl'd once again defiance! so my soul Might cope with worthy foes. People of France, Hear me! Beneath the vengeance of the law Traitors have perish'd countless; more survive: The hydra-headed faction lifts anew Her daring front, and fruitful from her wounds, Cautious from past defects, contrives new wiles Against the sons of Freedom. Tallien. Freedom lives! Oppression falls—for France has felt her chains, Has burst them too. Who traitor-like stept forth Amid the hall of Jacobins to save Camille Desmoulins, and the venal wretch D'Eglantine? Robespierre. I did—for I thought them honest. And Heaven forefend that Vengeance e'er should strike, Ere justice doom'd the blow. Barrere. Traitor, thou didst. Yes, the accomplice of their dark designs, Awhile didst thou defend them, when the storm Lower'd at safe distance. When the clouds frown'd darker, Fear'd for yourself and left them to their fate. Oh, I have mark'd thee long, and through the veil Seen thy foul projects. Yes, ambitious man, Self-will'd dictator o'er the realm of France, The vengeance thou hast plann'd for patriots Falls on thy head. Look how thy brother's deeds Dishonour thine! He the firm patriot, Thou the foul parricide of Liberty! Robespierre Junior. Barrere—attempt not meanly to divide Me from my brother. I partake his guilt, For I partake his virtue. Robespierre. Brother, by my soul, More dear I hold thee to my heart, that thus With me thou dar'st to tread the dangerous path Of virtue, than that Nature twined her cords Of kindred round us. Barrere. Yes, allied in guilt, Even as in blood ye are. O, thou worst wretch, Thou worse than Sylla! hast thou not proscrib'd, Yea, in most foul anticipation slaughter'd Each patriot representative of France? Bourdon l'Oise. Was not the younger Caesar too to reign O'er all our valiant armies in the south, And still continue there his merchant wiles? Robespierre Junior. His merchant wiles! Oh, grant me patience, heaven! Was it by merchant wiles I gain'd you back Toulon, when proudly on her captive towers Wav'd high the English flag? or fought I then With merchant wiles, when sword in hand I led Your troops to conquest? fought I merchant-like, Or barter'd I for victory, when death Strode o'er the reeking streets with giant stride, And shook his ebon plumes, and sternly smil'd Amid the bloody banquet? when appall'd The hireling sons of England spread the sail Of safety, fought I like a merchant then? Oh, patience! patience! Bourdon l'Oise. How this younger tyrant Mouths out defiance to us! even so He had led on the armies of the south, Till once again the plains of France were drench'd With her best blood. Collot d'Herbois. Till once again display'd Lyons' sad tragedy had call'd me forth The minister of wrath, whilst slaughter by Had bathed in human blood. Dubois Crancé. No wonder, friend, That we are traitors—that our heads must fall Beneath the axe of death! when Caesar-like Reigns Robespierre, 'tis wisely done to doom The fall of Brutus. Tell me, bloody man, Hast thou not parcell'd out deluded France, As it had been some province won in fight, Between your curst triumvirate? You, Couthon, Go with my brother to the southern plains; St. Just, be yours the army of the north; Meantime I rule at Paris. Robespierre. Matchless knave! What—not one blush of conscience on thy cheek— Not one poor blush of truth! most likely tale! That I who ruined Brissot's towering hopes, I who discover'd Hébert's impious wiles, And sharp'd for Danton's recreant neck the axe, Should now be traitor! had I been so minded, Think ye I had destroyed the very men Whose plots resembled mine? bring forth your proofs Of this deep treason. Tell me in whose breast Found ye the fatal scroll? or tell me rather Who forg'd the shameless falsehood? Collot d'Herbois. Ask you proofs? Robespierre, what proofs were ask'd when Brissot died? Legendre. What proofs adduced you when the Danton died? When at the imminent peril of my life I rose, and fearless of thy frowning brow, Proclaim'd him guiltless? Robespierre. I remember well The fatal day. I do repent me much That I kill'd Caesar and spar'd Antony. But I have been too lenient. I have spared The stream of blood, and now my own must flow To fill the current. [Loud applauses. Triumph not too soon, Justice may yet be victor. Enter St. Just, and mounts the Tribune. St. Just. I come from the Committee—charged to speak Of matters of high import. I omit Their orders. Representatives of France, Boldly in his own person speaks St. Just What his own heart shall dictate. Tallien. Hear ye this, Insulted delegates of France? St. Just From your Committee comes—comes charg'd to speak Of matters of high import, yet omits Their orders! Representatives of France, That bold man I denounce, who disobeys The nation's orders.—I denounce St. Just. [Loud applauses. St. Just. Hear me! [Violent murmurs. Robespierre. He shall be heard! Bourdon l'Oise. Must we contaminate this sacred hall With the foul breath of treason? Collot d'Herbois. Drag him away! Hence with him to the bar. Couthon. Oh, just proceedings! Robespierre prevented liberty of speech— And Robespierre is a tyrant! Tallien reigns, He dreads to hear the voice of innocence— And St. Just must be silent! Legendre. Heed we well That justice guide our actions. No light import Attends this day. I move St. Just be heard. Freron. Inviolate be the sacred right of man. The freedom of debate. [Violent applauses. St. Just. I may be heard then! much the times are chang'd, When St. Just thanks this hall for hearing him. Robespierre is call'd a tyrant. Men of France, Judge not too soon. By popular discontent Was Aristides driven into exile, Was Phocion murder'd. Ere ye dare pronounce Robespierre is guilty, it befits ye well, Consider who accuse him. Tallien, Bourdon of Oise—the very men denounced, For that their dark intrigues disturb'd the plan Of government. Legendre the sworn friend Of Danton, fall'n apostate. Dubois Crancé, He who at Lyons spared the royalists— Collot d'Herbois— Bourdon l'Oise. What—shall the traitor rear His head amid our tribune—and blaspheme Each patriot? shall the hireling slave of faction— St. Just. I am of no one faction. I contend Against all factions. Tallien. I espouse the cause Of truth. Robespierre on yester morn pronounced Upon his own authority a report. To-day St. Just comes down. St. Just neglects What the Committee orders, and harangues From his own will. O citizens of France I weep for you—I weep for my poor country— I tremble for the cause of Liberty, When individuals shall assume the sway, And with more insolence than kingly pride Rule the Republic. Billaud Varennes. Shudder, ye representatives of France, Shudder with horror. Henriot commands The marshall'd force of Paris. Henriot, Foul parricide—the sworn ally of Hébert, Denounced by all—upheld by Robespierre. Who spar'd La Valette? who promoted him, Stain'd with the deep dye of nobility? Who to an ex-peer gave the high command? Who screen'd from justice the rapacious thief? Who cast in chains the friends of Liberty? Robespierre, the self-stil'd patriot Robespierre— Robespierre, allied with villain Daubigné— Robespierre, the foul arch-tyrant Robespierre. Bourdon l'Oise. He talks of virtue—of morality— Consistent patriot! he Daubigné's friend! Henriot's supporter virtuous! preach of virtue, Yet league with villains, for with Robespierre Villains alone ally. Thou art a tyrant! I stile thee tyrant, Robespierre! [Loud applauses. Robespierre. Take back the name. Ye citizens of France— [Violent clamour. Cries of—Down with the Tyrant! Tallien. Oppression falls. The traitor stands appall'd— Guilt's iron fangs engrasp his shrinking soul— He hears assembled France denounce his crimes! He sees the mask torn from his secret sins— He trembles on the precipice of fate. Fall'n guilty tyrant! murder'd by thy rage How many an innocent victim's blood has stain'd Fair freedom's altar! Sylla-like thy hand Mark'd down the virtues, that, thy foes removed, Perpetual Dictator thou might'st reign, And tyrannize o'er France, and call it freedom! Long time in timid guilt the traitor plann'd His fearful wiles—success emboldened sin— And his stretch'd arm had grasp'd the diadem Ere now, but that the coward's heart recoil'd, Lest France awak'd should rouse her from her dream, And call aloud for vengeance. He, like Caesar, With rapid step urged on his bold career, Even to the summit of ambitious power, And deem'd the name of King alone was wanting. Was it for this we hurl'd proud Capet down? Is it for this we wage eternal war Against the tyrant horde of murderers, The crownéd cockatrices whose foul venom Infects all Europe? was it then for this We swore to guard our liberty with life, That Robespierre should reign? the spirit of freedom Is not yet sunk so low. The glowing flame That animates each honest Frenchman's heart Not yet extinguish'd. I invoke thy shade, Immortal Brutus! I too wear a dagger; And if the representatives of France, Through fear or favour, should delay the sword Of justice, Tallien emulates thy virtues; Tallien, like Brutus, lifts the avenging arm; Tallien shall save his country. [Violent applauses. Billaud Varennes. I demand The arrest of all the traitors. Memorable Will be this day for France. Robespierre. Yes! Memorable This day will be for France—for villains triumph. Lebas. I will not share in this day's damning guilt. Condemn me too. [Great cry—Down with the Tyrants! (The two Robespierres, Couthon, St. Just, and Lebas are led off.) ACT III Scene continues. Collot d'Herbois. Caesar is fall'n! The baneful tree of Java, Whose death-distilling boughs dropt poisonous dew, Is rooted from its base. This worse than Cromwell, The austere, the self-denying Robespierre, Even in this hall, where once with terror mute We listen'd to the hypocrite's harangues, Has heard his doom. Billaud Varennes. Yet must we not suppose The tyrant will fall tamely. His sworn hireling Henriot, the daring desperate Henriot, Commands the force of Paris. I denounce him. Freron. I denounce Fleuriot too, the mayor of Paris. Enter Dubois Crancé. Dubois Crancé. Robespierre is rescued. Henriot at the head Of the arm'd force has rescued the fierce tyrant. Collot d'Herbois. Ring the tocsin—call all the citizens To save their country—never yet has Paris Forsook the representatives of France. Tallien. It is the hour of danger. I propose This sitting be made permanent. [Loud applauses. Collot d'Herbois. The National Convention shall remain Firm at its post. Enter a Messenger. Messenger. Robespierre has reach'd the Commune. They espouse The tyrant's cause. St. Just is up in arms! St. Just—the young ambitious bold St. Just Harangues the mob. The sanguinary Couthon Thirsts for your blood. [Tocsin rings. Tallien. These tyrants are in arms against the law: Outlaw the rebels. Enter Merlin of Douay. Merlin. Health to the representatives of France! I past this moment through the arméd force— They ask'd my name—and when they heard a delegate, Swore I was not the friend of France. Collot d'Herbois. The tyrants threaten us as when they turn'd The cannon's mouth on Brissot. Enter another Messenger. Second Messenger. Vivier harangues the Jacobins—the Club Espouse the cause of Robespierre. Enter another Messenger. Third Messenger. All's lost—the tyrant triumphs. Henriot leads The soldiers to his aid.—Already I hear The rattling cannon destined to surround This sacred hall. Tallien. Why, we will die like men then, The representatives of France dare death, When duty steels their bosoms. [Loud applauses. Tallien (addressing the galleries). Citizens! France is insulted in her delegates— The majesty of the Republic is insulted— Tyrants are up in arms. An arméd force Threats the Convention. The Convention swears To die, or save the country! [Violent applauses from the galleries. Citizen (from above). We too swear To die, or save the country. Follow me. [All the men quit the galleries. Enter another Messenger. Fourth Messenger. Henriot is taken! [Loud applauses. Three of your brave soldiers Swore they would seize the rebel slave of tyrants, Or perish in the attempt. As he patroll'd The streets of Paris, stirring up the mob, They seiz'd him. [Applauses. Billaud Varennes. Let the names of these brave men Live to the future day. Enter Bourdon l'Oise, sword in hand. Bourdon l'Oise. I have clear'd the Commune. [Applauses. Through the throng I rush'd, Brandishing my good sword to drench its blade Deep in the tyrant's heart. The timid rebels Gave way. I met the soldiery—I spake Of the dictator's crimes—of patriots chain'd In dark deep dungeons by his lawless rage— Of knaves secure beneath his fostering power. I spake of Liberty. Their honest hearts Caught the warm flame. The general shout burst forth, ‘Live the Convention—Down with Robespierre!’ [Applauses. (Shouts from without—Down with the Tyrant!) Tallien. I hear, I hear the soul-inspiring sounds, France shall be saved! her generous sons attached To principles, not persons, spurn the idol They worshipp'd once. Yes, Robespierre shall fall As Capet fell! Oh! never let us deem That France shall crouch beneath a tyrant's throne, That the almighty people who have broke On their oppressors' heads the oppressive chain, Will court again their fetters! easier were it To hurl the cloud-capt mountain from its base, Than force the bonds of slavery upon men Determined to be free! [Applauses. Enter Legendre—a pistol in one hand, keys in the other. Legendre (flinging down the keys). So—let the mutinous Jacobins meet now In the open air. [Loud applauses. A factious turbulent party Lording it o'er the state since Danton died, And with him the Cordeliers.—A hireling band Of loud-tongued orators controull'd the Club, And bade them bow the knee to Robespierre. Vivier has 'scaped me. Curse his coward heart— This fate-fraught tube of Justice in my hand, I rush'd into the hall. He mark'd mine eye That beam'd its patriot anger, and flash'd full With death-denouncing meaning. 'Mid the throng He mingled. I pursued—but stay'd my hand, Lest haply I might shed the innocent blood. [Applauses. Freron. They took from me my ticket of admission— Expell'd me from their sittings.—Now, forsooth, Humbled and trembling re-insert my name. But Freron enters not the Club again 'Till it be purged of guilt:—'till, purified Of tyrants and of traitors, honest men May breathe the air in safety. [Shouts from without. Barrere. What means this uproar! if the tyrant band Should gain the people once again to rise— We are as dead! Tallien. And wherefore fear we death? Did Brutus fear it? or the Grecian friends Who buried in Hipparchus' breast the sword, And died triumphant? Caesar should fear death, Brutus must scorn the bugbear. (Shouts from without—Live the Convention!—Down with the Tyrants!) Tallien. Hark! again The sounds of honest Freedom! Enter Deputies from the Sections. Citizen. Citizens! representatives of France! Hold on your steady course. The men of Paris Espouse your cause. The men of Paris swear They will defend the delegates of Freedom. Tallien. Hear ye this, Colleagues? hear ye this, my brethren? And does no thrill of joy pervade your breasts? My bosom bounds to rapture. I have seen The sons of France shake off the tyrant yoke; I have, as much as lies in mine own arm, Hurl'd down the usurper—Come death when it will, I have lived long enough. [Shouts without. Barrere. Hark! how the noise increases! through the gloom Of the still evening—harbinger of death, Rings the tocsin! the dreadful generale Thunders through Paris— [Cry without—Down with the Tyrant! Enter Lecointre. Lecointre. So may eternal justice blast the foes Of France! so perish all the tyrant brood, As Robespierre has perish'd! Citizens, Caesar is taken. [Loud and repeated applauses. I marvel not that with such fearless front He braved our vengeance, and with angry eye Scowled round the hall defiance. He relied On Henriot's aid—the Commune's villain friendship, And Henriot's boughten succours. Ye have heard How Henriot rescued him—how with open arms The Commune welcom'd in the rebel tyrant— How Fleuriot aided, and seditious Vivier Stirr'd up the Jacobins. All had been lost— The representatives of France had perish'd— Freedom had sunk beneath the tyrant arm Of this foul parricide, but that her spirit Inspir'd the men of Paris. Henriot call'd ‘To arms’ in vain, whilst Bourdon's patriot voice Breathed eloquence, and o'er the Jacobins Legendre frown'd dismay. The tyrants fled— They reach'd the Hôtel. We gather'd round—we call'd For vengeance! Long time, obstinate in despair, With knives they hack'd around them. 'Till foreboding The sentence of the law, the clamorous cry Of joyful thousands hailing their destruction, Each sought by suicide to escape the dread Of death. Lebas succeeded. From the window Leapt the younger Robespierre, but his fractur'd limb Forbade to escape. The self-will'd dictator Plunged often the keen knife in his dark breast, Yet impotent to die. He lives all mangled By his own tremulous hand! All gash'd and gored He lives to taste the bitterness of death. Even now they meet their doom. The bloody Couthon, The fierce St. Just, even now attend their tyrant To fall beneath the axe. I saw the torches Flash on their visages a dreadful light— I saw them whilst the black blood roll'd adown Each stern face, even then with dauntless eye Scowl round contemptuous, dying as they lived, Fearless of fate! [Loud and repeated applauses. Barrere mounts the Tribune. For ever hallowed be this glorious day, When Freedom, bursting her oppressive chain, Tramples on the oppressor. When the tyrant Hurl'd from his blood-cemented throne, by the arm Of the almighty people, meets the death He plann'd for thousands. Oh! my sickening heart Has sunk within me, when the various woes Of my brave country crowded o'er my brain In ghastly numbers—when assembled hordes, Dragg'd from their hovels by despotic power, Rush'd o'er her frontiers, plunder'd her fair hamlets, And sack'd her populous towns, and drench'd with blood The reeking fields of Flanders.—When within, Upon her vitals prey'd the rankling tooth Of treason; and oppression, giant form, Trampling on freedom, left the alternative Of slavery, or of death. Even from that day, When, on the guilty Capet, I pronounced The doom of injured France, has faction reared Her hated head amongst us. Roland preach'd Of mercy—the uxorious dotard Roland, The woman-govern'd Roland durst aspire To govern France; and Petion talk'd of virtue, And Vergniaud's eloquence, like the honeyed tongue Of some soft Syren wooed us to destruction. We triumphed over these. On the same scaffold Where the last Louis pour'd his guilty blood, Fell Brissot's head, the womb of darksome treasons, And Orleans, villain kinsman of the Capet, And Hébert's atheist crew, whose maddening hand Hurl'd down the altars of the living God, With all the infidel's intolerance. The last worst traitor triumphed—triumph'd long, Secur'd by matchless villainy—by turns Defending and deserting each accomplice As interest prompted. In the goodly soil Of Freedom, the foul tree of treason struck Its deep-fix'd roots, and dropt the dews of death On all who slumber'd in its specious shade. He wove the web of treachery. He caught The listening crowd by his wild eloquence, His cool ferocity that persuaded murder, Even whilst it spake of mercy!—never, never Shall this regenerated country wear The despot yoke. Though myriads round assail, And with worse fury urge this new crusade Than savages have known; though the leagued despots Depopulate all Europe, so to pour The accumulated mass upon our coasts, Sublime amid the storm shall France arise, And like the rock amid surrounding waves Repel the rushing ocean.—She shall wield The thunder-bolt of vengeance—she shall blast The despot's pride, and liberate the world! FINIS OSORIO A TRAGEDY The variant manuscript readings of Osorio, and variations between it and the recast play, “Remorse”, have not been reproduced. DRAMATIS PERSONAE Velez Father to the two brothers, and Doña Teresa's Guardian. Albert the eldest son. Osorio the youngest son. Francesco a Dominican and Inquisitor. Maurice the faithful attendant on Alvar. Ferdinand a Moresco Chieftain, ostensibly a Christian. Naomi Maria an Orphan Heiress. Alhadra, wife of Ferdinand, Familiars of the Inquisition. Moors, Servants, &amp;c. Time. The reign of Philip II., just at the close of the civil wars against the Moors, and during the heat of the persecution which raged against them, shortly after the edict which forbad the wearing of Moresco apparel under pain of death. In the reign of Philip II shortly after the civil war against the Moors, and during the heat of the Persecution which raged against them. Maria an orphan of fortune had been espoused to Albert the eldest son of Lord Velez, but he having been supposed dead, is now addressed by Osorio the brother of Albert. In the character of Osorio I wished to represent a man, who, from his childhood had mistaken constitutional abstinence from vices, for strength of character—thro' his pride duped into guilt, and then endeavouring to shield himself from the reproaches of his own mind by misanthropy. Don Garcia (supposed dead) and Valdez father of Don Ordoño, and Guardian of Teresa di Monviedro. Don Garcia eldest son of the Marquis di Valdez, supposed dead, having been six years absent, and for the last three without any tidings of him. Teresa Senñora [sic] di Monviedro, an orphan lady, bequeathed by both Parents on their death-bed to the wardship of the Marquis, and betrothed to Don Garcia—Gulinaez a Moorish Chieftain and ostensibly a new Christian—Alhadra his wife. ACT THE FIRST Scene —The sea shore on the coast of Granada. Velez, Maria. Maria. I hold Osorio dear: he is your son, And Albert's brother. Velez. Love him for himself, Nor make the living wretched for the dead. Maria. I mourn that you should plead in vain, Lord Velez! But Heaven hath heard my vow, and I remain Faithful to Albert, be he dead or living. Velez. Heaven knows with what delight I saw your loves; And could my heart's blood give him back to thee I would die smiling. But these are idle thoughts! Thy dying father comes upon my soul With that same look, with which he gave thee to me: I held thee in mine arms, a powerless babe, While thy poor mother with a mute entreaty Fix'd her faint eyes on mine: ah, not for this, That I should let thee feed thy soul with gloom, And with slow anguish wear away thy life, The victim of a useless constancy. I must not see thee wretched. Maria. There are woes Ill-barter'd for the garishness of joy! If it be wretched with an untired eye To watch those skiey tints, and this green ocean; Or in the sultry hour beneath some rock, My hair dishevell'd by the pleasant sea-breeze, To shape sweet visions, and live o'er again All past hours of delight; if it be wretched To watch some bark, and fancy Albert there; To go through each minutest circumstance Of the bless'd meeting, and to frame adventures Most terrible and strange, and hear him tell them: (As once I knew a crazy Moorish maid, Who dress'd her in her buried lover's cloaths, And o'er the smooth spring in the mountain cleft Hung with her lute, and play'd the selfsame tune He used to play, and listen'd to the shadow Herself had made); if this be wretchedness, And if indeed it be a wretched thing To trick out mine own death-bed, and imagine That I had died—died, just ere his return; Then see him listening to my constancy; And hover round, as he at midnight ever Sits on my grave and gazes at the moon; Or haply in some more fantastic mood To be in Paradise, and with choice flowers. Build up a bower where he and I might dwell, And there to wait his coming! O my sire! My Albert's sire! if this be wretchedness That eats away the life, what were it, think you, If in a most assur'd reality He should return, and see a brother's infant Smile at him from my arms? [Clasping her forehead. O what a thought! 'Twas horrible! it pass'd my brain like lightning. Velez. 'Twere horrible, if but one doubt remain'd The very week he promised his return. Maria. Ah, what a busy joy was ours—to see him After his three years' travels! tho' that absence His still-expected, never-failing letters Almost endear'd to me! Even then what tumult! Velez. O power of youth to feed on pleasant thoughts Spite of conviction! I am old and heartless! Yes, I am old—I have no pleasant dreams— Hectic and unrefresh'd with rest. Maria (with great tenderness). My father! Velez. Aye, 'twas the morning thou didst try to cheer me With a fond gaiety. My heart was bursting, And yet I could not tell me, how my sleep Was throng'd with swarthy faces, and I saw The merchant-ship in which my son was captured— Well, well, enough—captured in sight of land— We might almost have seen it from our house-top! Maria (abruptly). He did not perish there! Velez (impatiently). Nay, nay—how aptly thou forgett'st a tale Thou ne'er didst wish to learn—my brave Osorio Saw them both founder in the storm that parted Him and the pirate: both the vessels founder'd. Gallant Osorio! [Pauses, then tenderly. O belov'd Maria, Would'st thou best prove thy faith to generous Albert And most delight his spirit, go and make His brother happy, make his agéd father Sink to the grave with joy! Maria. For mercy's sake Press me no more. I have no power to love him! His proud forbidding eye, and his dark brow Chill me, like dew-damps of the unwholesome night. My love, a timorous and tender flower, Closes beneath his touch. Velez. You wrong him, maiden. You wrong him, by my soul! Nor was it well To character by such unkindly phrases The stir and workings of that love for you Which he has toil'd to smother. 'Twas not well— Nor is it grateful in you to forget His wounds and perilous voyages, and how With an heroic fearlessness of danger He roamed the coast of Afric for your Albert. It was not well—you have moved me even to tears. Maria. O pardon me, my father! pardon me. It was a foolish and ungrateful speech, A most ungrateful speech! But I am hurried Beyond myself, if I but dream of one Who aims to rival Albert. Were we not Born on one day, like twins of the same parent? Nursed in one cradle? Pardon me, my father! A six years' absence is an heavy thing; Yet still the hope survives— Velez (looking forwards). Hush—hush! Maria. Maria. It is Francesco, our Inquisitor; That busy man, gross, ignorant, and cruel! Enter Francesco and Alhadra. Francesco (to Velez). Where is your son, my lord? Oh! here he comes. Enter Osorio. My Lord Osorio! this Moresco woman (Alhadra is her name) asks audience of you. Osorio. Hail, reverend father! What may be the business? Francesco. O the old business—a Mohammedan! The officers are in her husband's house, And would have taken him, but that he mention'd Your name, asserting that you were his friend, Aye, and would warrant him a Catholic. But I know well these children of perdition, And all their idle fals[e]hoods to gain time; So should have made the officers proceed, But that this woman with most passionate outcries, (Kneeling and holding forth her infants to me) So work'd upon me, who (you know, my lord!) Have human frailties, and am tender-hearted, That I came with her. Osorio. You are merciful. [Looking at Alhadra. I would that I could serve you; but in truth Your face is new to me. [Alhadra is about to speak, but is interrupted by Francesco. Aye, aye—I thought so; And so I said to one of the familiars. A likely story, said I, that Osorio, The gallant nobleman, who fought so bravely Some four years past against these rebel Moors; Working so hard from out the garden of faith To eradicate these weeds detestable; That he should countenance this vile Moresco, Nay, be his friend—and warrant him, forsooth! Well, well, my lord! it is a warning to me; Now I return. Alhadra. My lord, my husband's name Is Ferdinand: you may remember it. Three years ago—three years this very week— You left him at Almeria. Francesco (triumphantly). Palpably false! This very week, three years ago, my lord! (You needs must recollect it by your wound) You were at sea, and fought the Moorish fiends Who took and murder'd your poor brother Albert. [Maria looks at Francesco with disgust and horror. Osorio's appearance to be collected from the speech that follows. Francesco (to Velez and pointing to Osorio). What? is he ill, my lord? How strange he looks! Velez (angrily). You started on him too abruptly, father! The fate of one, on whom you know he doted. Osorio (starting as in a sudden agitation). O heavens! I doted! [Then, as if recovering himself. Yes! I doted on him! [Osorio walks to the end of the stage. Velez follows soothing him. Maria (her eye following them). I do not, cannot love him. Is my heart hard? Is my heart hard? that even now the thought Should force itself upon me—yet I feel it! Francesco. The drops did start and stand upon his forehead! I will return—in very truth I grieve To have been the occasion. Ho! attend me, woman! Alhadra (to Maria). O gentle lady, make the father stay Till that my lord recover. I am sure That he will say he is my husband's friend. Maria. Stay, father, stay—my lord will soon recover. [Osorio and Velez returning. Osorio (to Velez as they return). Strange! that this Francesco Should have the power so to distemper me. Velez. Nay, 'twas an amiable weakness, son! Francesco (to Osorio). My lord, I truly grieve— Osorio. Tut! name it not. A sudden seizure, father! think not of it. As to this woman's husband, I do know him: I know him well, and that he is a Christian. Francesco. I hope, my lord, your sensibility Doth not prevail. Osorio. Nay, nay—you know me better. You hear what I have said. But 'tis a trifle. I had something here of more importance. [Touching his forehead as if in the act of recollection. Hah! The Count Mondejar, our great general, Writes, that the bishop we were talking of Has sicken'd dangerously. Francesco. Even so. Osorio. I must return my answer. Francesco. When, my lord? Osorio. To-morrow morning, and shall not forget How bright and strong your zeal for the Catholic faith. Francesco. You are too kind, my lord! You overwhelm me. Osorio. Nay, say not so. As for this Ferdinand, 'Tis certain that he was a Catholic. What changes may have happen'd in three years, I cannot say, but grant me this, good father! I'll go and sift him: if I find him sound, You'll grant me your authority and name To liberate his house. Francesco. My lord you have it. Osorio (to Alhadra). I will attend you home within an hour. Meantime return with us, and take refreshment. Alhadra. Not till my husband's free, I may not do it. I will stay here. Maria (aside). Who is this Ferdinand? Velez. Daughter! Maria. With your permission, my dear lord, I'll loiter a few minutes, and then join you. [Exeunt Velez, Francesco, and Osorio. Alhadra. Hah! there he goes. A bitter curse go with him. A scathing curse! [Alhadra had been betrayed by the warmth of her feelings into an imprudence. She checks herself, yet recollecting Maria's manner towards Francesco, says in a shy and distrustful manner You hate him, don't you, lady! Maria. Nay, fear me not! my heart is sad for you. Alhadra. These fell Inquisitors, these sons of blood! As I came on, his face so madden'd me That ever and anon I clutch'd my dagger And half unsheathed it. Maria. Be more calm, I pray you. Alhadra. And as he stalk'd along the narrow path Close on the mountain's edge, my soul grew eager. 'Twas with hard toil I made myself remember That his foul officers held my babes and husband. To have leapt upon him with a Tyger's plunge And hurl'd him down the ragged precipice, O—it had been most sweet! Maria. Hush, hush! for shame. Where is your woman's heart? Alhadra. O gentle lady! You have no skill to guess my many wrongs, Many and strange. Besides I am a Christian, And they do never pardon, 'tis their faith! Maria. Shame fall on those who so have shown it to thee! Alhadra. I know that man; 'tis well he knows not me! Five years ago, and he was the prime agent. Five years ago the Holy Brethren seized me. Maria. What might your crime be? Alhadra. Solely my complexion. They cast me, then a young and nursing mother, Into a dungeon of their prison house. There was no bed, no fire, no ray of light, No touch, no sound of comfort! The black air, It was a toil to breathe it! I have seen The gaoler's lamp, the moment that he enter'd, How the flame sunk at once down to the socket. O miserable, by that lamp to see My infant quarrelling with the coarse hard bread Brought daily: for the little wretch was sickly— My rage had dry'd away its natural food! In darkness I remain'd, counting the clocks Which haply told me that the blessed sun Was rising on my garden. When I dozed, My infant's moanings mingled with my dreams And wak'd me. If you were a mother, Lady, I should scarce dare to tell you, that its noises And peevish cries so fretted on my brain That I have struck the innocent babe in anger! Maria. O God! it is too horrible to hear! Alhadra. What was it then to suffer? 'Tis most right That such as you should hear it. Know you not What Nature makes you mourn, she bids you heal? Great evils ask great passions to redress them, And whirlwinds fitliest scatter pestilence. Maria. You were at length deliver'd? Alhadra. Yes, at length I saw the blessed arch of the whole heaven. 'Twas the first time my infant smiled! No more. For if I dwell upon that moment, lady, A fit comes on, which makes me o'er again All I then was, my knees hang loose and drag, And my lip falls with such an ideot laugh That you would start and shudder! Maria. But your husband? Alhadra. A month's imprisonment would kill him, lady! Maria. Alas, poor man! Alhadra. He hath a lion's courage, But is not stern enough for fortitude. Unfit for boisterous times, with gentle heart He worships Nature in the hill and valley, Not knowing what he loves, but loves it all! [Enter Albert disguised as a Moresco, and in Moorish garments. Albert (not observing Maria and Alhadra). Three weeks have I been loitering here, nor ever Have summon'd up my heart to ask one question, Or stop one peasant passing on this way. Maria. Know you that man? Alhadra. His person, not his name. I doubt not, he is some Moresco chieftain Who hides himself among the Alpuxarras. A week has scarcely pass'd since first I saw him; He has new-roof'd the desolate old cottage Where Zagri lived—who dared avow the prophet And died like one of the faithful! There he lives, And a friend with him. Maria. Does he know his danger So near this seat? Alhadra. He wears the Moorish robes too, As in defiance of the royal edict. [Alhadra advances to Albert, who has walked to the back of the stage near the rocks. Maria drops her veil. Alhadra. Gallant Moresco! you are near the castle Of the Lord Velez, and hard by does dwell A priest, the creature of the Inquisition. Albert (retiring). You have mistaken me—I am a Christian. Alhadra (to Maria). He deems that we are plotting to ensnare him. Speak to him, lady! none can hear you speak And not believe you innocent of guile. [Albert, on hearing this, pauses and turns round. Maria. If aught enforce you to concealment, sir! Alhadra. He trembles strangely. [Albert sinks down and hides his face in his garment. Maria. See—we have disturb'd him. [Approaches nearer to him. I pray you, think us friends—uncowl your face, For you seem faint, and the night-breeze blows healing. I pray you, think us friends! Albert (raising his head). Calm—very calm; 'Tis all too tranquil for reality! And she spoke to me with her innocent voice. That voice! that innocent voice! She is no traitress! It was a dream, a phantom of my sleep, A lying dream. [He starts up, and abruptly addresses her. Maria! you are not wedded? Maria (haughtily to Alhadra). Let us retire. [They advance to the front of the stage. Alhadra. He is indeed a Christian. Some stray Sir Knight, that falls in love of a sudden. Maria. What can this mean? How should he know my name? It seems all shadowy. Alhadra. Here he comes again. Albert (aside). She deems me dead, and yet no mourning garment! Why should my brother's wife wear mourning garments? God of all mercy, make me, make me quiet! [To Maria. Your pardon, gentle maid! that I disturb'd you. I had just started from a frightful dream. Alhadra. These renegado Moors—how soon they learn The crimes and follies of their Christian tyrants! Albert. I dreamt I had a friend, on whom I lean'd With blindest trust, and a betrothéd maid Whom I was wont to call not mine, but me, For mine own self seem'd nothing, lacking her! This maid so idoliz'd, that trusted friend, Polluted in my absence soul and body! And she with him and he with her conspired To have me murder'd in a wood of the mountains: But by my looks and most impassion'd words I roused the virtues, that are dead in no man, Even in the assassins' hearts. They made their terms, And thank'd me for redeeming them from murder. Alhadra (to Maria). You are lost in thought. Hear him no more, sweet lady! Maria. From morn to night I am myself a dreamer, And slight things bring on me the idle mood. Well, sir, what happen'd then? Albert. On a rude rock, A rock, methought, fast by a grove of firs Whose threaddy leaves to the low breathing gale Made a soft sound most like the distant ocean, I stay'd as tho' the hour of death were past, And I were sitting in the world of spirits, For all things seem'd unreal! There I sate. The dews fell clammy, and the night descended, Black, sultry, close! and ere the midnight hour A storm came on, mingling all sounds of fear That woods and sky and mountains seem'd one havock! The second flash of lightning show'd a tree Hard by me, newly-scathed. I rose tumultuous: My soul work'd high: I bared my head to the storm, And with loud voice and clamorous agony Kneeling I pray'd to the great Spirit that made me, Pray'd that Remorse might fasten on their hearts, And cling, with poisonous tooth, inextricable As the gored lion's bite! Maria. A fearful curse! Alhadra. But dreamt you not that you return'd and kill'd him? Dreamt you of no revenge? Albert (his voice trembling, and in tones of deep distress). She would have died, Died in her sins—perchance, by her own hands! And bending o'er her self-inflicted wounds I might have met the evil glance of frenzy And leapt myself into an unblest grave! I pray'd for the punishment that cleanses hearts, For still I loved her! Alhadra. And you dreamt all this? Maria. My soul is full of visions, all is wild! Alhadra. There is no room in this heart for puling lovetales. Lady! your servants there seem seeking us. Maria (lifts up her veil and advances to Albert). Stranger, farewell! I guess not who you are, Nor why you so address'd your tale to me. Your mien is noble, and, I own, perplex'd me With obscure memory of something past, Which still escap'd my efforts, or presented Tricks of a fancy pamper'd with long-wishing. If (as it sometimes happens) our rude startling, While your full heart was shaping out its dream, Drove you to this, your not ungentle wildness, You have my sympathy, and so farewell! But if some undiscover'd wrongs oppress you, And you need strength to drag them into light, The generous Velez, and my Lord Osorio Have arm and will to aid a noble sufferer, Nor shall you want my favourable pleading. [Exeunt Maria and Alhadra. Albert (alone). 'Tis strange! it cannot be! my Lord Osorio! Her Lord Osorio! Nay, I will not do it. I curs'd him once, and one curse is enough. How sad she look'd and pale! but not like guilt, And her calm tones—sweet as a song of mercy! If the bad spirit retain'd his angel's voice, Hell scarce were hell. And why not innocent? Who meant to murder me might well cheat her. But ere she married him, he had stain'd her honour. Ah! there I am hamper'd. What if this were a lie Fram'd by the assassin? who should tell it him If it were truth? Osorio would not tell him. Yet why one lie? All else, I know, was truth. No start! no jealousy of stirring conscience! And she referr'd to me—fondly, methought! Could she walk here, if that she were a traitress? Here where we play'd together in our childhood? Here where we plighted vows? Where her cold cheek Received my last kiss, when with suppress'd feelings She had fainted in my arms? It cannot be! 'Tis not in nature! I will die, believing That I shall meet her where no evil is, No treachery, no cup dash'd from the lips! I'll haunt this scene no more—live she in peace! Her husband—ay, her husband! May this Angel New-mould his canker'd heart! Assist me, Heaven! That I may pray for my poor guilty brother! END OF ACT THE FIRST. ACT THE SECOND Scene the First. —A wild and mountainous country. Osorio and Ferdinand are discovered at a little distance from a house, which stands under the brow of a slate rock, the rock covered with vines. Ferdinand and Osorio. Ferdinand. Thrice you have sav'd my life. Once in the battle You gave it me, next rescued me from suicide, When for my follies I was made to wander With mouths to feed, and not a morsel for them. Now, but for you, a dungeon's slimy stones Had pillow'd my snapt joints. Osorio. Good Ferdinand! Why this to me? It is enough you know it. Ferdinand. A common trick of gratitude, my lord! Seeking to ease her own full heart. Osorio. Enough. A debt repay'd ceases to be a debt. You have it in your power to serve me greatly. Ferdinand. As how, my lord? I pray you name the thing! I would climb up an ice-glaz'd precipice To pluck a weed you fancied. Osorio (with embarrassment and hesitation). Why—that—lady— Ferdinand. 'Tis now three years, my lord! since last I saw you. Have you a son, my lord? Osorio. O miserable! [Aside. Ferdinand! you are a man, and know this world. I told you what I wish'd—now for the truth! She lov'd the man you kill'd! Ferdinand (looking as suddenly alarmed). You jest, my lord? Osorio. And till his death is proved, she will not wed me. Ferdinand. You sport with me, my lord? Osorio. Come, come, this foolery Lives only in thy looks—thy heart disowns it. Ferdinand. I can bear this, and anything more grievous From you, my lord!—but how can I serve you here? Osorio. Why, you can mouth set speeches solemnly, Wear a quaint garment, make mysterious antics. Ferdinand. I am dull, my lord! I do not comprehend you. Osorio. In blunt terms you can play the sorcerer. She has no faith in Holy Church, 'tis true. Her lover school'd her in some newer nonsense: Yet still a tale of spirits works on her. She is a lone enthusiast, sensitive, Shivers, and cannot keep the tears in her eye. Such ones do love the marvellous too well Not to believe it. We will wind her up With a strange music, that she knows not of, With fumes of frankincense, and mummery— Then leave, as one sure token of his death, That portrait, which from off the dead man's neck I bade thee take, the trophy of thy conquest. Ferdinand (with hesitation). Just now I should have cursed the man who told me You could ask aught, my lord! and I refuse. But this I cannot do. Osorio. Where lies your scruple? Ferdinand. That shark Francesco. Osorio. O! an o'ersiz'd gudgeon! I baited, sir, my hook with a painted mitre, And now I play with him at the end of the line. Well—and what next? Ferdinand (stammering). Next, next—my lord! You know you told me that the lady loved you, Had loved you with incautious tenderness. That if the young man, her betrothéd husband, Return'd, yourself, and she, and an unborn babe, Must perish. Now, my lord! to be a man! Osorio (aloud, though to express his contempt he speaks in the third person). This fellow is a man! he kill'd for hire One whom he knew not—yet has tender scruples. [Then turning to Ferdinand. Thy hums and ha's, thy whine and stammering. Pish—fool! thou blunder'st through the devil's book, Spelling thy villany! Ferdinand. My lord—my lord! I can bear much, yes, very much from you. But there's a point where sufferance is meanness! I am no villain, never kill'd for hire. My gratitude— Osorio. O! aye, your gratitude! 'Twas a well-sounding word—what have you done with it? Ferdinand. Who proffers his past favours for my virtue Tries to o'erreach me, is a very sharper, And should not speak of gratitude, my lord! I knew not 'twas your brother! Osorio (evidently alarmed). And who told you? Ferdinand. He himself told me. Osorio. Ha! you talk'd with him? And those, the two Morescoes, that went with you? Ferdinand. Both fell in a night-brawl at Malaga. Osorio (in a low voice). My brother! Ferdinand. Yes, my lord! I could not tell you: I thrust away the thought, it drove me wild. But listen to me now. I pray you, listen! Osorio. Villain! no more! I'll hear no more of it. Ferdinand. My lord! it much imports your future safety That you should hear it. Osorio (turning off from Ferdinand). Am I not a man? 'Tis as it should be! Tut—the deed itself Was idle—and these after-pangs still idler! Ferdinand. We met him in the very place you mention'd, Hard by a grove of firs. Osorio. Enough! enough! Ferdinand. He fought us valiantly, and wounded all; In fine, compell'd a parley! Osorio (sighing as if lost in thought). Albert! Brother! Ferdinand. He offer'd me his purse. Osorio. Yes? Ferdinand. Yes! I spurn'd it. He promis'd us I know not what—in vain! Then with a look and voice which overaw'd me, He said—What mean you, friends? My life is dear. I have a brother and a promised wife Who make life dear to me, and if I fall That brother will roam earth and hell for vengeance. There was a likeness in his face to yours. I ask'd his brother's name; he said, Osorio, Son of Lord Velez! I had well-nigh fainted! At length I said (if that indeed I said it, And that no spirit made my tongue his organ), That woman is now pregnant by that brother, And he the man who sent us to destroy you, He drove a thrust at me in rage. I told him, He wore her portrait round his neck—he look'd As he had been made of the rock that propp'd him back; Ay, just as you look now—only less ghastly! At last recovering from his trance, he threw His sword away, and bade us take his life— It was not worth his keeping. Osorio. And you kill'd him? O blood-hounds! may eternal wrath flame round you! He was the image of the Deity. [A pause. It seizes me—by Hell! I will go on! What? would'st thou stop, man? thy pale looks won't save thee! [Then suddenly pressing his forehead. Oh! cold, cold, cold—shot thro' with icy cold! Ferdinand (aside). Were he alive, he had return'd ere now. The consequence the same, dead thro' his plotting! Osorio. O this unutterable dying away here, This sickness of the heart! [A pause. What if I went And liv'd in a hollow tomb, and fed on weeds? Ay! that's the road to heaven! O fool! fool! fool! [A pause. What have I done but that which nature destin'd Or the blind elements stirr'd up within me? If good were meant, why were we made these beings? And if not meant— Ferdinand. How feel you now, my lord? [Osorio starts, looks at him wildly, then, after a pause, during which his features are forced into a smile. Osorio. A gust of the soul! i'faith, it overset me. O 'twas all folly—all! idle as laughter! Now, Ferdinand, I swear that thou shalt aid me. Ferdinand (in a low voice). I'll perish first! Shame on my coward heart, That I must slink away from wickedness Like a cow'd dog! Osorio. What dost thou mutter of? Ferdinand. Some of your servants know me, I am certain. Osorio. There's some sense in that scruple; but we'll mask you. Ferdinand. They'll know my gait. But stay! of late I have watch'd A stranger that lives nigh, still picking weeds, Now in the swamp, now on the walls of the ruin, Now clamb'ring, like a runaway lunatic, Up to the summit of our highest mount. I have watch'd him at it morning-tide and noon, Once in the moonlight. Then I stood so near, I heard him mutt'ring o'er the plant. A wizard! Some gaunt slave, prowling out for dark employments. Osorio. What may his name be? Ferdinand. That I cannot tell you. Only Francesco bade an officer Speak in your name, as lord of this domain. So he was question'd, who and what he was. This was his answer: Say to the Lord Osorio, ‘He that can bring the dead to life again.’ Osorio. A strange reply! Ferdinand. Aye—all of him is strange. He call'd himself a Christian—yet he wears The Moorish robe, as if he courted death. Osorio. Where does this wizard live? Ferdinand (pointing to a distance). You see that brooklet? Trace its course backward thro' a narrow opening It leads you to the place. Osorio. How shall I know it? Ferdinand. You can't mistake. It is a small green dale Built all around with high off-sloping hills, And from its shape our peasants aptly call it The Giant's Cradle. There's a lake in the midst, And round its banks tall wood, that branches over And makes a kind of faery forest grow Down in the water. At the further end A puny cataract falls on the lake; And there (a curious sight) you see its shadow For ever curling, like a wreath of smoke, Up through the foliage of those faery trees. His cot stands opposite—you cannot miss it. Some three yards up the hill a mountain ash Stretches its lower boughs and scarlet clusters O'er the new thatch. Osorio. I shall not fail to find it. [Exit Osorio. Ferdinand goes into his house. Scene changes. The inside of a cottage, around which flowers and plants of various kinds are seen. Albert and Maurice. Albert. He doth believe himself an iron soul, And therefore puts he on an iron outward And those same mock habiliments of strength Hide his own weakness from himself. Maurice. His weakness! Come, come, speak out! Your brother is a villain! Yet all the wealth, power, influence, which is yours You suffer him to hold! Albert. Maurice! dear Maurice! That my return involved Osorio's death I trust would give me an unmingl'd pang— Yet bearable. But when I see my father Strewing his scant grey hairs even on the ground Which soon must be his grave; and my Maria, Her husband proved a monster, and her infants His infants—poor Maria!—all would perish, All perish—all!—and I (nay bear with me!) Could not survive the complicated ruin! Maurice (much affected). Nay, now, if I have distress'd you—you well know, I ne'er will quit your fortunes! true, 'tis tiresome. You are a painter—one of many fancies— You can call up past deeds, and make them live On the blank canvas, and each little herb, That grows on mountain bleak, or tangled forest, You've learnt to name—but I— Albert. Well, to the Netherlands We will return, the heroic Prince of Orange Will grant us an asylum, in remembrance Of our past service. Maurice. Heard you not some steps? Albert. What if it were my brother coming onward! Not very wisely (but his creature teiz'd me) I sent a most mysterious message to him. Maurice. Would he not know you? Albert. I unfearingly Trust this disguise. Besides, he thinks me dead; And what the mind believes impossible, The bodily sense is slow to recognize. Add too my youth, when last we saw each other; Manhood has swell'd my chest, and taught my voice A hoarser note. Maurice. Most true! And Alva's Duke Did not improve it by the unwholesome viands He gave so scantily in that foul dungeon, During our long imprisonment. Enter Osorio. Albert. It is he! Maurice. Make yourself talk; you'll feel the less. Come, speak. How do you find yourself? Speak to me, Albert. Albert (placing his hand on his heart). A little fluttering here; but more of sorrow! Osorio. You know my name, perhaps, better than me. I am Osorio, son of the Lord Velez. Albert (groaning aloud). The son of Velez! [Osorio walks leisurely round the room, and looks attentively at the plants. Maurice. Why, what ails you now? [Albert grasps Maurice's hand in agitation. Maurice. How your hand trembles, Albert! Speak! what wish you? Albert. To fall upon his neck and weep in anguish! Osorio (returning). All very curious! from a ruin'd abbey Pluck'd in the moonlight. There's a strange power in weeds When a few odd prayers have been mutter'd o'er them. Then they work miracles! I warrant you, There's not a leaf, but underneath it lurks Some serviceable imp. There's one of you, Who sent me a strange message. Albert. I am he! Osorio. I will speak with you, and by yourself. [Exit Maurice. Osorio. ‘He that can bring the dead to life again.’ Such was your message, Sir! You are no dullard, But one that strips the outward rind of things! Albert. 'Tis fabled there are fruits with tempting rinds That are all dust and rottenness within. Would'st thou I should strip such? Osorio. Thou quibbling fool, What dost thou mean? Think'st thou I journey'd hither To sport with thee? Albert. No, no! my lord! to sport Best fits the gaiety of innocence! Osorio (draws back as if stung and embarrassed, then folding his arms). O what a thing is Man! the wisest heart A fool—a fool, that laughs at its own folly, Yet still a fool! [Looks round the cottage. It strikes me you are poor! Albert. What follows thence? Osorio. That you would fain be richer. Besides, you do not love the rack, perhaps, Nor a black dungeon, nor a fire of faggots. The Inquisition—hey? You understand me, And you are poor. Now I have wealth and power, Can quench the flames, and cure your poverty. And for this service, all I ask you is That you should serve me—once—for a few hours. Albert (solemnly). Thou art the son of Velez! Would to Heaven That I could truly and for ever serve thee! Osorio. The canting scoundrel softens. [Aside. You are my friend! ‘He that can bring the dead to life again.’ Nay, no defence to me. The holy brethren Believe these calumnies. I know thee better. [Then with great bitterness. Thou art a man, and as a man I'll trust thee! Albert. Alas, this hollow mirth! Declare your business! Osorio. I love a lady, and she would love me But for an idle and fantastic scruple. Have you no servants round the house? no listeners? [Osorio steps to the door. Albert. What! faithless too? false to his angel wife? To such a wife? Well might'st thou look so wan, Ill-starr'd Maria! Wretch! my softer soul Is pass'd away! and I will probe his conscience. Osorio (returned). In truth this lady loved another man, But he has perish'd. Albert. What? you kill'd him? hey? Osorio. I'll dash thee to the earth, if thou but think'st it, Thou slave! thou galley-slave! thou mountebank! I leave thee to the hangman! Albert. Fare you well! I pity you, Osorio! even to anguish! [Albert retires off the stage. Osorio (recovering himself). 'Twas ideotcy! I'll tie myself to an aspen, And wear a Fool's Cap. Ho! [Calling after Albert. Albert (returning). Be brief, what wish you? Osorio. You are deep at bartering—you charge yourself At a round sum. Come, come, I spake unwisely. Albert. I listen to you. Osorio. In a sudden tempest Did Albert perish—he, I mean, the lover— The fellow— Albert. Nay, speak out, 'twill ease your heart To call him villain! Why stand'st thou aghast? Men think it natural to hate their rivals! Osorio (hesitating and half doubting whether he should proceed). Now till she knows him dead she will not wed me! Albert (with eager vehemence). Are you not wedded, then? Merciful God! Not wedded to Maria? Osorio. Why, what ails thee? Art mad or drunk? Why look'st thou upward so? Dost pray to Lucifer, prince of the air? Albert. Proceed. I shall be silent. [Albert sits, and leaning on the table hides his face. Osorio. To Maria! Politic wizard! ere you sent that message, You had conn'd your lesson, made yourself proficient In all my fortunes! Hah! you prophesied A golden crop!—well, you have not mistaken— Be faithful to me, and I'll pay thee nobly. Albert (lifting up his head). Well—and this lady! Osorio. If we could make her certain of his death, She needs must wed me. Ere her lover left her, She tied a little portrait round his neck Entreating him to wear it. Albert (sighing). Yes! he did so! Osorio. Why, no! he was afraid of accidents, Of robberies and shipwrecks, and the like. In secrecy he gave it me to keep Till his return. Albert. What, he was your friend then? Osorio (wounded and embarrassed). I was his friend. [A pause. Now that he gave it me This lady knows not. You are a mighty wizard— Can call this dead man up—he will not come— He is in heaven then!—there you have no influence— Still there are tokens; and your imps may bring you Something he wore about him when he died. And when the smoke of the incense on the altar Is pass'd, your spirits will have left this picture. What say you now? Albert (after a long pause). Osorio, I will do it. Osorio. Delays are dangerous. It shall be to-morrow In the early evening. Ask for the Lord Velez. I will prepare him. Music, too, and incense, All shall be ready. Here is this same picture— And here what you will value more, a purse. Before the dusk— Albert. I will not fail to meet you. Osorio. Till next we meet, farewell! Albert (alone, gazes passionately at the portrait). And I did curse thee? At midnight? on my knees? And I believed Thee perjured, thee polluted, thee a murderess? O blind and credulous fool! O guilt of folly! Should not thy inarticulate fondnesses, Thy infant loves—should not thy maiden vows, Have come upon my heart? And this sweet image Tied round my neck with many a chaste endearment And thrilling hands, that made me weep and tremble. Ah, coward dupe! to yield it to the miscreant Who spake pollutions of thee! I am unworthy of thy love, Maria! Of that unearthly smile upon those lips, Which ever smil'd on me! Yet do not scorn me. I lisp'd thy name ere I had learnt my mother's! Enter Maurice. Albert. Maurice! that picture, which I painted for thee, Of my assassination. Maurice. I'll go fetch it. Albert. Haste! for I yearn to tell thee what has pass'd. [Maurice goes out. Albert (gazing at the portrait). Dear image! rescued from a traitor's keeping, I will not now prophane thee, holy image! To a dark trick! That worst bad man shall find A picture which shall wake the hell within him, And rouse a fiery whirlwind in his conscience! END OF ACT THE SECOND. ACT THE THIRD Scene the First. —A hall of armory, with an altar in the part farthest from the stage. Velez, Osorio, Maria. Maria. Lord Velez! you have ask'd my presence here, And I submit; but (Heaven bear witness for me!) My heart approves it not! 'tis mockery! [Here Albert enters in a sorcerer's robe. Maria (to Albert). Stranger! I mourn and blush to see you here On such employments! With far other thoughts I left you. Osorio (aside). Ha! he has been tampering with her! Albert. O high-soul'd maiden, and more dear to me Than suits the stranger's name, I swear to thee, I will uncover all concealed things! Doubt, but decide not! Stand from off the altar. [Here a strain of music is heard from behind the scenes, from an instrument of glass or steel— the harmonica or Celestina stop, or Clagget's metallic organ. Albert. With no irreverent voice or uncouth charm I call up the departed. Soul of Albert! Hear our soft suit, and heed my milder spells: So may the gates of Paradise unbarr'd Cease thy swift toils, since haply thou art one Of that innumerable company, Who in broad circle, lovelier than the rainbow, Girdle this round earth in a dizzy motion, With noise too vast and constant to be heard— Fitliest unheard! For, O ye numberless And rapid travellers! what ear unstun'd, What sense unmadden'd, might bear up against The rushing of your congregated wings? Even now your living wheel turns o'er my head! Ye, as ye pass, toss high the desart sands, That roar and whiten, like a burst of waters, A sweet appearance, but a dread illusion, To the parch'd caravan that roams by night. And ye build up on the becalmed waves That whirling pillar, which from earth to heaven Stands vast, and moves in blackness. Ye too split The ice-mount, and with fragments many and huge, Tempest the new-thaw'd sea, whose sudden gulphs Suck in, perchance, some Lapland wizard's skiff. Then round and round the whirlpool's marge ye dance, Till from the blue-swoln corse the soul toils out, And joins your mighty army. Soul of Albert! Hear the mild spell and tempt no blacker charm. By sighs unquiet and the sickly pang Of an half dead yet still undying hope, Pass visible before our mortal sense; So shall the Church's cleansing rites be thine, Her knells and masses that redeem the dead. (Sung behind the scenes, accompanied by the same instrument as before.) THE SONG Hear, sweet spirit! hear the spell Lest a blacker charm compel! So shall the midnight breezes swell With thy deep long-lingering knell. And at evening evermore In a chapel on the shore Shall the chanters sad and saintly, Yellow tapers burning faintly, Doleful masses chant for thee, Miserere, Domine! Hark! the cadence dies away On the quiet moonlight sea, The boatmen rest their oars, and say, Miserere, Domine! [A long pause. Osorio. This was too melancholy, father! Velez. Nay! My Albert lov'd sad music from a child. Once he was lost; and after weary search We found him in an open place of the wood, To which spot he had follow'd a blind boy Who breathed into a pipe of sycamore Some strangely-moving notes, and these, he said, Were taught him in a dream; him we first saw Stretch'd on the broad top of a sunny heath-bank; And, lower down, poor Albert fast asleep, His head upon the blind boy's dog—it pleased me To mark, how he had fasten'd round the pipe A silver toy, his grandmother had given him. Methinks I see him now, as he then look'd. His infant dress was grown too short for him, Yet still he wore it. Albert (aside). My tears must not flow— I must not clasp his knees, and cry, my father! Osorio. The innocent obey nor charm nor spell. My brother is in heaven. Thou sainted spirit Burst on our sight, a passing visitant! Once more to hear thy voice, once more to see thee, O 'twere a joy to me. Albert (abruptly). A joy to thee! What if thou heard'st him now? What if his spirit Re-enter'd its cold corse, and came upon thee, With many a stab from many a murderer's poniard? What if, his steadfast eye still beaming pity And brother's love, he turn'd his head aside, Lest he should look at thee, and with one look Hurl thee beyond all power of penitence? Velez. These are unholy fancies! Osorio (struggling with his feelings). Yes, my father! He is in heaven! Albert (still to Osorio). But what if this same brother Had lived even so, that at his dying hour The name of heaven would have convuls'd his face More than the death-pang? Maria. Idly-prating man! He was most virtuous. Albert (still to Osorio). What if his very virtues Had pamper'd his swoln heart, and made him proud? And what if pride had duped him into guilt, Yet still he stalk'd, a self-created God, Not very bold, but excellently cunning; And one that at his mother's looking-glass, Would force his features to a frowning sternness? Young lord! I tell thee, that there are such beings,— Yea, and it gives fierce merriment to the damn'd, To see these most proud men, that loathe mankind, At every stir and buz of coward conscience, Trick, cant, and lie, most whining hypocrites! Away! away! Now let me hear more music. [Music as before. Albert. The spell is mutter'd—come, thou wandering shape, Who own'st no master in an eye of flesh, Whate'er be this man's doom, fair be it or foul, If he be dead, come quick, and bring with thee That which he grasp'd in death; and if he lives, Some token of his obscure perilous life. [The whole orchestra crashes into one chorus. Wandering demon! hear the spell Lest a blacker charm compel! [A thunder-clap. The incense on the altar takes fire suddenly. Maria. This is some trick—I know, it is a trick. Yet my weak fancy, and these bodily creepings, Would fain give substance to the shadow. Velez (advancing to the altar). Hah! A picture! Maria. O God! my picture? Albert (gazing at Maria with wild impatient distressfulness). Pale—pale—deadly pale! Maria. He grasp'd it when he died. [She swoons. Albert rushes to her and supports her. Albert. My love! my wife! Pale—pale, and cold! My love! my wife! Maria! [Velez is at the altar. Osorio remains near him in a state of stupor. Osorio (rousing himself). Where am I? 'Twas a lazy chilliness. Velez (takes and conceals the picture in his robe). This way, my son! She must not see this picture. Go, call the attendants! Life will soon ebb back! [Velez and Osorio leave the stage. Albert. Her pulse doth flutter. Maria! my Maria! Maria (recovering—looks round). I heard a voice—but often in my dreams, I hear that voice, and wake; and try, and try, To hear it waking—but I never could! And 'tis so now—even so! Well, he is dead, Murder'd perhaps! and I am faint, and feel As if it were no painful thing to die! Albert (eagerly). Believe it not, sweet maid! believe it not, Beloved woman! 'Twas a low imposture Framed by a guilty wretch. Maria. Ha! who art thou? Albert (exceedingly agitated). My heart bursts over thee! Maria. Didst thou murder him? And dost thou now repent? Poor troubled man! I do forgive thee, and may Heaven forgive thee! Albert (aside). Let me be gone. Maria. If thou didst murder him, His spirit ever, at the throne of God, Asks mercy for thee, prays for mercy for thee, With tears in heaven! Albert. Albert was not murder'd. Your foster-mother— Maria. And doth she know aught? Albert. She knows not aught—but haste thou to her cottage To-morrow early—bring Lord Velez with thee. There ye must meet me—but your servants come. Maria (wildly). Nay—nay—but tell me! [A pause—then presses her forehead. Ah! 'tis lost again! This dead confused pain! [A pause—she gazes at Albert. Mysterious man! Methinks, I cannot fear thee—for thine eye Doth swim with pity—I will lean on thee. [Exeunt Albert and Maria. Re-enter Velez and Osorio. Velez (sportively). You shall not see the picture, till you own it. Osorio. This mirth and raillery, sir! beseem your age. I am content to be more serious. Velez. Do you think I did not scent it from the first? An excellent scheme, and excellently managed. 'Twill blow away her doubts, and now she'll wed you, I'faith, the likeness is most admirable. I saw the trick—yet these old eyes grew dimmer With very foolish tears, it look'd so like him! Osorio. Where should I get her portrait? Velez. Get her portrait? Portrait? You mean the picture! At the painter's— No difficulty then—but that you lit upon A fellow that could play the sorcerer, With such a grace and terrible majesty, It was most rare good fortune. And how deeply He seem'd to suffer when Maria swoon'd, And half made love to her! I suppose you'll ask me Why did he so? Osorio (with deep tones of suppressed agitation). Ay, wherefore did he so? Velez. Because you bade him—and an excellent thought! A mighty man, and gentle as he is mighty. He'll wind into her confidence, and rout A host of scruples—come, confess, Osorio! Osorio. You pierce through mysteries with a lynx's eye, In this, your merry mood! you see it all! Velez. Why, no!—not all. I have not yet discover'd, At least, not wholly, what his speeches meant. Pride and hypocrisy, and guilt and cunning— Then when he fix'd his obstinate eye on you, And you pretended to look strange and tremble. Why—why—what ails you now? Osorio (with a stupid stare). Me? why? what ails me? A pricking of the blood—it might have happen'd At any other time. Why scan you me? Velez (clapping him on the shoulder). 'Twon't do—'twon't do—I have lived too long in the world. His speech about the corse and stabs and murderers, Had reference to the assassins in the picture: That I made out. Osorio (with a frantic eagerness). Assassins! what assassins! Velez. Well-acted, on my life! Your curiosity Runs open-mouth'd, ravenous as winter wolf. I dare not stand in its way. [He shows Osorio the picture. Osorio. Dup'd—dup'd—dup'd! That villain Ferdinand! (aside). Velez. Dup'd—dup'd—not I. As he swept by me— Osorio. Ha! what did he say? Velez. He caught his garment up and hid his face. It seem'd as he were struggling to suppress— Osorio. A laugh! a laugh! O hell! he laughs at me! Velez. It heaved his chest more like a violent sob. Osorio. A choking laugh! [A pause—then very wildly. I tell thee, my dear father! I am most glad of this! Velez. Glad!—aye—to be sure. Osorio. I was benumb'd, and stagger'd up and down Thro' darkness without light—dark—dark—dark— And every inch of this my flesh did feel As if a cold toad touch'd it! Now 'tis sunshine, And the blood dances freely thro' its channels! [He turns off—then (to himself) mimicking Ferdinand's manner. ‘A common trick of gratitude, my lord! Old Gratitude! a dagger would dissect His own full heart,’ 'twere good to see its colour! Velez (looking intently at the picture). Calm, yet commanding! how he bares his breast, Yet still they stand with dim uncertain looks, As penitence had run before their crime. A crime too black for aught to follow it Save blasphemous despair! See this man's face— With what a difficult toil he drags his soul To do the deed. [Then to Osorio. O this was delicate flattery To poor Maria, and I love thee for it! Osorio (in a slow voice with a reasoning laugh). Love—love—and then we hate—and what? and wherefore? Hatred and love. Strange things! both strange alike! What if one reptile sting another reptile, Where is the crime? The goodly face of Nature Hath one trail less of slimy filth upon it. Are we not all predestined rottenness And cold dishonor? Grant it that this hand Had given a morsel to the hungry worms Somewhat too early. Where's the guilt of this? That this must needs bring on the idiotcy Of moist-eyed penitence—'tis like a dream! Velez. Wild talk, my child! but thy excess of feeling [Turns off from Osorio. Sometimes, I fear, it will unhinge his brain! Osorio. I kill a man and lay him in the sun, And in a month there swarm from his dead body A thousand—nay, ten thousand sentient beings In place of that one man whom I had kill'd. Now who shall tell me, that each one and all, Of these ten thousand lives, is not as happy As that one life, which being shov'd aside Made room for these ten thousand? Velez. Wild as madness! Osorio. Come, father! you have taught me to be merry, And merrily we'll pore upon this picture. Velez (holding the picture before Osorio). That Moor, who points his sword at Albert's breast— Osorio (abruptly). A tender-hearted, scrupulous, grateful villain, Whom I will strangle! Velez. And these other two— Osorio. Dead—dead already!—what care I for the dead? Velez. The heat of brain and your too strong affection For Albert, fighting with your other passion, Unsettle you, and give reality To these your own contrivings. Osorio. Is it so? You see through all things with your penetration. Now I am calm. How fares it with Maria? My heart doth ache to see her. Velez. Nay—defer it! Defer it, dear Osorio! I will go. [Exit Velez. Osorio. A rim of the sun lies yet upon the sea— And now 'tis gone! all may be done this night! Enter a Servant. Osorio. There is a man, once a Moresco chieftain, One Ferdinand. Servant. He lives in the Alpuxarras, Beneath a slate rock. Osorio. Slate rock? Servant. Yes, my lord! If you had seen it, you must have remember'd The flight of steps his children had worn up it With often clambering. Osorio. Well, it may be so. Servant. Why, now I think on't, at this time of the year 'Tis hid by vines. Osorio (in a muttering voice). The cavern—aye—the cavern. He cannot fail to find it. [To the Servant. Where art going? You must deliver to this Ferdinand A letter. Stay till I have written it. [Exit the Servant. Osorio (alone). The tongue can't stir when the mouth is fill'd with mould. A little earth stops up most eloquent mouths, And a square stone with a few pious texts Cut neatly on it, keeps the earth down tight. Scene changes to the space before the castle. Francesco and a Spy. Francesco. Yes! yes! I have the key of all their lives. If a man fears me, he is forced to love me. And if I can, and do not ruin him, He is fast bound to serve and honour me! [Albert enters from the castle, and is crossing the stage. Spy. There—there—your Reverence! That is the sorcerer. [Francesco runs up and rudely catches hold of Albert. Albert dashes him to the earth. Francesco and the Spy make an uproar ,and the servants rush from out the castle. Francesco. Seize, seize and gag him! or the Church curses you! [The servants seize and gag Albert. Enter Velez and Osorio. Osorio (aside). This is most lucky! Francesco (inarticulate with rage). See you this, Lord Velez? Good evidence have I of most foul sorcery, And in the name of Holy Church command you To give me up the keys—the keys, my lord! Of that same dungeon-hole beneath your castle. This imp of hell—but we delay enquiry Till to Granada we have convoy'd him. Osorio (to the Servants). Why haste you not? Go, fly and dungeon him! Then bring the keys and give them to his Reverence. [The Servants hurry off Albert. Osorio goes up to Francesco, and pointing at Albert. Osorio (with a laugh). ‘He that can bring the dead to life again.’ Francesco. What? did you hear it? Osorio. Yes, and plann'd this scheme To bring conviction on him. Ho! a wizard, Thought I—but where's the proof! I plann'd this scheme. The scheme has answer'd—we have proof enough. Francesco. My lord, your pious policy astounds me. I trust my honest zeal— Osorio. Nay, reverend father! It has but raised my veneration for you. But 'twould be well to stop all intertalk Between my servants and this child of darkness. Francesco. My lord! with speed I'll go, make swift return, And humbly redeliver you the keys. [Exit Francesco. Osorio (alone). ‘The stranger, that lives nigh, still picking weeds.’ And this was his friend, his crony, his twin-brother! O! I am green, a very simple stripling— The wise men of this world make nothing of me. By Heaven, 'twas well contrived! And I, forsooth, I was to cut my throat in honour of conscience. And this tall wizard—ho!—he was to pass For Albert's friend! He hath a trick of his manner. He was to tune his voice to honey'd sadness, And win her to a transfer of her love By lamentable tales of her dear Albert, And his dear Albert! Yea, she would have lov'd him. He, that can sigh out in a woman's ear Sad recollections of her perish'd lover, And sob and smile with veering sympathy, And, now and then, as if by accident, Pass his mouth close enough to touch her cheek With timid lip, he takes the lover's place, He takes his place, for certain! Dusky rogue, Were it not sport to whimper with thy mistress, Then steal away and roll upon my grave, Till thy sides shook with laughter? Blood! blood! blood! They want thy blood! thy blood, Osorio! [END OF ACT THE THIRD.] ACT THE FOURTH Scene the First. —A cavern, dark except where a gleam of moonlight is seen on one side of the further end of it, supposed to be cast on it from a cranny in a part of the cavern out of sight. [Ferdinand alone, an extinguished torch in his hand. Ferdinand. Drip! drip! drip! drip!—in such a place as this It has nothing else to do but drip! drip! drip! I wish it had not dripp'd upon my torch. Faith 'twas a moving letter—very moving! His life in danger—no place safe but this. 'Twas his turn now to talk of gratitude! And yet—but no! there can't be such a villain. It cannot be! Thanks to that little cranny Which lets the moonlight in! I'll go and sit by it. To peep at a tree, or see a he-goat's beard, Or hear a cow or two breathe loud in their sleep, 'Twere better than this dreary noise of water-drops! [He goes out of sight, opposite to the patch of moonlight, returns after a minute's elapse in an ecstasy of fear. A hellish pit! O God—'tis like my night-mair! I was just in!—and those damn'd fingers of ice Which clutch'd my hair up! Ha! what's that? it moved! [Ferdinand stands staring at another recess in the cavern. In the mean time Osorio enters with a torch and hollas to him Ferdinand. I swear, I saw a something moving there! The moonshine came and went, like a flash of lightning. I swear, I saw it move! [Osorio goes into the recess, then returns, and with great scorn. Osorio. A jutting clay-stone Drips on the long lank weed that grows beneath; And the weed nods and drips. Ferdinand (forcing a faint laugh). A joke to laugh at! It was not that which frighten'd me, my lord! Osorio. What frighten'd you? Ferdinand. You see that little cranny? But first permit me, [Lights his torch at Osorio's, and while lighting it. [A lighted torch in the hand Is no unpleasant object here—one's breath Floats round the flame, and makes as many colours As the thin clouds that travel near the moon.] You see that cranny there? Osorio. Well, what of that? Ferdinand. I walk'd up to it, meaning to sit there. When I had reach'd it within twenty paces— [Ferdinand starts as if he felt the terror over again. Merciful Heaven! Do go, my lord! and look. [Osorio goes and returns. Osorio. It must have shot some pleasant feelings thro' you? Ferdinand. If every atom of a dead man's flesh Should move, each one with a particular life, Yet all as cold as ever—'twas just so! Or if it drizzled needle-points of frost Upon a feverish head made suddenly bald— Osorio (interrupting him). Why, Ferdinand! I blush for thy cowardice. It would have startled any man, I grant thee. But such a panic. Ferdinand. When a boy, my lord! I could have sat whole hours beside that chasm, Push'd in huge stones and heard them thump and rattle Against its horrid sides; and hung my head Low down, and listen'd till the heavy fragments Sunk, with faint crash, in that still groaning well, Which never thirsty pilgrim blest, which never A living thing came near; unless, perchance, Some blind-worm battens on the ropy mould, Close at its edge. Osorio. Art thou more coward now? Ferdinand. Call him that fears his fellow-men a coward. I fear not man. But this inhuman cavern It were too bad a prison-house for goblins. Besides (you'll laugh, my lord!) but true it is, My last night's sleep was very sorely haunted By what had pass'd between us in the morning. I saw you in a thousand hideous ways, And doz'd and started, doz'd again and started. I do entreat your lordship to believe me, In my last dream— Osorio. Well? Ferdinand. I was in the act Of falling down that chasm, when Alhadra Waked me. She heard my heart beat! Osorio. Strange enough! Had you been here before? Ferdinand. Never, my lord! But my eyes do not see it now more clearly Than in my dream I saw that very chasm. [Osorio stands in a deep study—then, after a pause. Osorio. There is no reason why it should be so. And yet it is. Ferdinand. What is, my lord? Osorio. Unpleasant To kill a man! Ferdinand. Except in self-defence. Osorio. Why that's my case: and yet 'tis still unpleasant. At least I find it so! But you, perhaps, Have stronger nerves? Ferdinand. Something doth trouble you. How can I serve you? By the life you gave me, By all that makes that life of value to me, My wife, my babes, my honour, I swear to you, Name it, and I will toil to do the thing, If it be innocent! But this, my lord! Is not a place where you could perpetrate, No, nor propose a wicked thing. The darkness (When ten yards off, we know, 'tis chearful moonlight) Collects the guilt and crowds it round the heart. It must be innocent. Osorio. Thyself be judge. [Osorio walks round the cavern—then looking round it. One of our family knew this place well. Ferdinand. Who? when? my lord. Osorio. What boots it who or when? Hang up the torch. I'll tell his tale to thee. [They hang their torches in some shelf of the cavern. Osorio. He was a man different from other men, And he despised them, yet revered himself. Ferdinand. What? he was mad? Osorio. All men seem'd mad to him, Their actions noisome folly, and their talk— A goose's gabble was more musical. Nature had made him for some other planet, And press'd his soul into a human shape By accident or malice. In this world He found no fit companion! Ferdinand. Ah, poor wretch! Madmen are mostly proud. Osorio. He walk'd alone, And phantasies, unsought for, troubled him. Something within would still be shadowing out All possibilities, and with these shadows His mind held dalliance. Once, as so it happen'd, A fancy cross'd him wilder than the rest: To this in moody murmur, and low voice, He yielded utterance as some talk in sleep. The man who heard him— Why didst thou look round? Ferdinand. I have a prattler three years old, my lord! In truth he is my darling. As I went From forth my door, he made a moan in sleep— But I am talking idly—pray go on! And what did this man? Osorio. With his human hand He gave a being and reality To that wild fancy of a possible thing. Well it was done. [Then very wildly. Why babblest thou of guilt? The deed was done, and it pass'd fairly off. And he, whose tale I tell thee—dost thou listen? Ferdinand. I would, my lord, you were by my fireside! I'd listen to you with an eager eye, Tho' you began this cloudy tale at midnight. But I do listen—pray proceed, my lord! Osorio. Where was I? Ferdinand. He of whom you tell the tale— Osorio. Surveying all things with a quiet scorn Tamed himself down to living purposes, The occupations and the semblances Of ordinary men—and such he seem'd. But that some over-ready agent—he— Ferdinand. Ah! what of him, my lord? Osorio. He proved a villain; Betray'd the mystery to a brother villain; And they between them hatch'd a damnéd plot To hunt him down to infamy and death To share the wealth of a most noble family, And stain the honour of an orphan lady With barbarous mixture and unnatural union. What did the Velez? I am proud of the name, Since he dared do it. [Osorio grasps his sword and turns off from Ferdinand, then, after a pause, returns. Osorio. Our links burn dimly. Ferdinand. A dark tale darkly finish'd! Nay, my lord! Tell what he did. Osorio (fiercely). That which his wisdom prompted. He made the traitor meet him in this cavern, And here he kill'd the traitor. Ferdinand. No!—the fool. He had not wit enough to be a traitor. Poor thick-eyed beetle! not to have foreseen That he, who gull'd thee with a whimper'd lie To murder his own brother, would not scruple To murder thee, if e'er his guilt grew jealous And he could steal upon thee in the dark! Osorio. Thou would'st not then have come, if— Ferdinand. O yes, my lord! I would have met him arm'd, and scared the coward! [Ferdinand throws off his robe, shews himself armed, and draws his sword. Osorio. Now this is excellent, and warms the blood! My heart was drawing back, drawing me back With womanish pulls of pity. Dusky slave, Now I will kill thee pleasantly, and count it Among my comfortable thoughts hereafter. Ferdinand. And all my little ones fatherless! Die thou first. [They fight. Osorio disarms Ferdinand, and in disarming him, throws his sword up that recess, opposite to which they were standing. Ferdinand (springing wildly towards Osorio). Still I can strangle thee! Osorio. Nay, fool! stand off. I'll kill thee—but not so! Go fetch thy sword. [Ferdinand hurries into the recess with his torch. Osorio follows him, and in a moment returns alone. Osorio. Now—this was luck! No bloodstains, no dead body! His dream, too, is made out. Now for his friend. [Exit. Scene changes to the court before the Castle of Velez. Maria and her Foster-Mother. Maria. And when I heard that you desired to see me, I thought your business was to tell me of him. Foster-Mother. I never saw the Moor, whom you describe. Maria. 'Tis strange! he spake of you familiarly As mine and Albert's common foster-mother. Foster-Mother. Now blessings on the man, whoe'er he be, That join'd your names with mine! O my sweet lady, As often as I think of those dear times When you two little ones would stand at eve, On each side of my chair, and make me learn All you had learnt in the day; and how to talk In gentle phrase, then bid me sing to you, 'Tis more like heaven to come, that what has been! Maria. O my dear mother! this strange man has left me Wilder'd with wilder fancies than yon moon Breeds in the love-sick maid—who gazes at it Till lost in inward vision, with wet eye She gazes idly! But that entrance, mother! Foster-Mother. Can no one hear? It is a perilous tale! Maria. No one. Foster-Mother. My husband's father told it me, Poor old Leoni. Angels rest his soul! He was a woodman, and could fell and saw With lusty arm. You know that huge round beam Which props the hanging wall of the old chapel? Beneath that tree, while yet it was a tree, He found a baby wrapt in mosses, lined With thistle-beards, and such small locks of wool As hang on brambles. Well, he brought him home, And rear'd him at the then Lord Velez' cost. And so the babe grew up a pretty boy. A pretty boy, but most unteachable— And never learnt a prayer, nor told a bead, But knew the names of birds, and mock'd their notes, And whistled, as he were a bird himself. And all the autumn 'twas his only play To get the seeds of wild flowers, and to plant them With earth and water on the stumps of trees. A friar who gather'd simples in the wood, A grey-hair'd man—he loved this little boy, The boy loved him—and, when the friar taught him, He soon could write with the pen; and from that time Lived chiefly at the convent or the castle. So he became a very learned youth. But O! poor wretch—he read, and read, and read, Till his brain turn'd—and ere his twentieth year, He had unlawful thoughts of many things. And though he pray'd, he never loved to pray With holy men, nor in a holy place. But yet his speech, it was so soft and sweet, The late Lord Velez ne'er was wearied with him, And once as by the north side of the chapel They stood together, chain'd in deep discourse, The earth heav'd under them with such a groan, That the wall totter'd, and had well-nigh fall'n Right on their heads. My lord was sorely frighten'd; A fever seiz'd him; and he made confession Of all the heretical and lawless talk Which brought this judgment: so the youth was seiz'd And cast into that hole. My husband's father Sobb'd like a child—it almost broke his heart. And once as he was working in the cellar, He heard a voice distinctly; 'twas the youth's, Who sung a doleful song about green fields, How sweet it were on lake or wild savannah To hunt for food, and be a naked man, And wander up and down at liberty. He always doted on the youth, and now His love grew desperate; and defying death, He made that cunning entrance I described: And the young man escaped. Maria. 'Tis a sweet tale: Such as would lull a list'ning child to sleep, His rosy face besoil'd with unwiped tears. And what became of him? Foster-Mother. He went on shipboard With those bold voyagers, who made discovery Of golden lands; Leoni's younger brother Went likewise, and when he return'd to Spain, He told Leoni that the poor mad youth, Soon after they arrived in that new world, In spite of his dissuasion seized a boat, And all alone set sail by silent moonlight, Up a great river, great as any sea, And ne'er was heard of more; but 'tis supposed He liv'd and died among the savage men. Enter Velez. Velez. Still sad, Maria? This same wizard haunts you. Maria. O Christ! the tortures that hang o'er his head, If ye betray him to these holy brethren! Velez (with a kind of sneer). A portly man, and eloquent, and tender! In truth, I shall not wonder if you mourn That their rude grasp should seize on such a victim. Maria. The horror of their ghastly punishments Doth so o'ertop the height of sympathy, That I should feel too little for mine enemy— Ah! far too little—if 'twere possible, I could feel more, even tho' my child or husband Were doom'd to suffer them! That such things are— Velez. Hush! thoughtless woman! Maria. Nay—it wakes within me More than a woman's spirit. Velez (angrily). No more of this— I can endure no more. Foster-Mother. My honour'd master! Lord Albert used to talk so. Maria. Yes! my mother! These are my Albert's lessons, and I con them With more delight than, in my fondest hour, I bend me o'er his portrait. Velez (to the Foster-Mother). My good woman, You may retire. [Exit the Foster-Mother. Velez. We have mourn'd for Albert. Have I no living son? Maria. Speak not of him! That low imposture—my heart sickens at it, If it be madness, must I wed a madman? And if not madness, there is mystery, And guilt doth lurk behind it! Velez. Is this well? Maria. Yes! it is truth. Saw you his countenance? How rage, remorse, and scorn, and stupid fear, Displac'd each other with swift interchanges? If this were all assumed, as you believe, He must needs be a most consummate actor; And hath so vast a power to deceive me, I never could be safe. And why assume The semblance of such execrable feelings? Velez. Ungrateful woman! I have tried to stifle An old man's passion! Was it not enough That thou hast made my son a restless man, Banish'd his health and half-unhinged his reason, But that thou wilt insult him with suspicion, And toil to blast his honour? I am old— A comfortless old man! Thou shalt not stay Beneath my roof! [Francesco enters and stands listening. Velez. Repent and marry him— Or to the convent. Francesco (muttering). Good! good! very good! Maria. Nay, grant me some small pittance of my fortune, And I will live a solitary woman, Or my poor foster-mother and her grandsons May be my household. Francesco (advancing). I abhor a listener; But you spoke so, I could not choose but hear you. I pray, my lord! will you embolden me To ask you why this lady doth prefer To live in lonely sort, without a friend Or fit companion? Velez. Bid her answer you. Maria. Nature will be my friend and fit companion. [Turns off from them. O Albert! Albert! that they could return, Those blessed days, that imitated heaven! When we two wont to walk at evening-tide; When we saw nought but beauty; when we heard The voice of that Almighty One, who lov'd us, In every gale that breath'd, and wave that murmur'd! O we have listen'd, even till high-wrought pleasure Hath half-assumed the countenance of grief, And the deep sigh seem'd to heave up a weight Of bliss, that press'd too heavy on the heart. Francesco. But in the convent, lady, you would have Such aids as might preserve you from perdition. There you might dwell. Maria. With tame and credulous faith, Mad melancholy, antic merriment, Leanness, disquietude, and secret pangs! O God! it is a horrid thing to know That each pale wretch, who sits and drops her beads Had once a mind, which might have given her wings Such as the angels wear! Francesco (stifling his rage). Where is your son, my lord? Velez. I have not seen him, father, since he left you. Francesco. His lordship's generous nature hath deceiv'd him! That Ferdinand (or if not he his wife) I have fresh evidence—are infidels. We are not safe until they are rooted out. Maria. Thou man, who call'st thyself the minister Of Him whose law was love unutterable! Why is thy soul so parch'd with cruelty, That still thou thirstest for thy brother's blood? Velez (rapidly). Father! I have long suspected it—her brain— Heed it not, father! Francesco. Nay—but I must heed it. Maria. Thou miserable man! I fear thee not, Nor prize a life which soon may weary me. Bear witness, Heav'n! I neither scorn nor hate him— But O! 'tis wearisome to mourn for evils, Still mourn, and have no power to remedy! [Exit Maria. Francesco. My lord! I shall presume to wait on you To-morrow early. Velez. Be it so, good father! [Exit Francesco. Velez (alone). I do want solace, but not such as thine! The moon is high in heaven, and my eyes ache, But not with sleep. Well—it is ever so. A child, a child is born! and the fond heart Dances! and yet the childless are most happy. [Scene changes to the mountains by moonlight. Alhadra alone in a Moorish dress, her eyes fixed on the earth. Then drop in one after another, from different parts of the stage, a considerable number of Morescoes, all in their Moorish garments. They form a circle at a distance round Alhadra. After a pause one of the Morescoes to the man who stands next to him. First Moresco. The law which forced these Christian dresses on us, 'Twere pleasant to cleave down the wretch who framed it. Second. Yet 'tis not well to trample on it idly. First. Our country robes are dear. Second. And like dear friends, May chance to prove most perilous informers. [A third Moresco, Naomi, advances from out the circle. Naomi. Woman! may Alla and the prophet bless thee! We have obey'd thy call. Where is our chief? And why didst thou enjoin the Moorish garments? Alhadra (lifting up her eyes, and looking round on the circle). Warriors of Mahomet, faithful in the battle, My countrymen! Come ye prepared to work An honourable deed? And would ye work it In the slave's garb? Curse on those Christian robes! They are spell-blasted; and whoever wears them, His arm shrinks wither'd, his heart melts away, And his bones soften! Naomi. Where is Ferdinand? Alhadra (in a deep low voice). This night I went from forth my house, and left His children all asleep; and he was living! And I return'd, and found them still asleep— But he had perish'd. All. Perished? Alhadra. He had perish'd! Sleep on, poor babes! not one of you doth know That he is fatherless, a desolate orphan! Why should we wake them? Can an infant's arm Revenge his murder? One to Another. Did she say his murder? Naomi. Murder'd? Not murder'd? Alhadra. Murder'd by a Christian! [They all, at once, draw their sabres. Alhadra (to Naomi, who on being addressed again advances from the circle). Brother of Zagri! fling away thy sword: This is thy chieftain's! [He steps forward to take it. Dost thou dare receive it? For I have sworn by Alla and the prophet, No tear shall dim these eyes, this woman's heart Shall heave no groan, till I have seen that sword Wet with the blood of all the house of Velez! Enter Maurice. All. A spy! a spy! [They seize him. Maurice. Off! off! unhand me, slaves! [After much struggling he disengages himself and draws his sword. Naomi (to Alhadra). Speak! shall we kill him? Maurice. Yes! ye can kill a man, Some twenty of you! But ye are Spanish slaves! And slaves are always cruel, always cowards. Alhadra. That man has spoken truth. Whence and who art thou? Maurice. I seek a dear friend, whom for aught I know The son of Velez hath hired one of you To murder! Say, do ye know aught of Albert? Alhadra (starting). Albert?—three years ago I heard that name Murmur'd in sleep! High-minded foreigner! Mix thy revenge with mine, and stand among us. [Maurice stands among the Morescoes. Alhadra. Was not Osorio my husband's friend? Old Man. He kill'd my son in battle; yet our chieftain Forced me to sheathe my dagger. See—the point Is bright, unrusted with the villain's blood! Alhadra. He is your chieftain's murderer! Naomi. He dies by Alla! All (dropping on one knee). By Alla! Alhadra. This night a reeking slave came with loud pant, Gave Ferdinand a letter, and departed, Swift as he came. Pale, with unquiet looks, He read the scroll. Maurice. Its purport? Alhadra. Yes, I ask'd it. He answer'd me, ‘Alhadra! thou art worthy A nobler secret; but I have been faithful To this bad man, and faithful I will be.’ He said, and arm'd himself, and lit a torch; Then kiss'd his children, each one on its pillow, And hurried from me. But I follow'd him At distance, till I saw him enter there. Naomi. The cavern? Alhadra. Yes—the mouth of yonder cavern. After a pause I saw the son of Velez Rush by with flaring torch; he likewise enter'd— There was another and a longer pause— And once, methought, I heard the clash of swords, And soon the son of Velez reappear'd. He flung his torch towards the moon in sport, And seem'd as he were mirthful! I stood listening Impatient for the footsteps of my husband! Maurice. Thou called'st him? Alhadra. I crept into the cavern: 'Twas dark and very silent. [Then wildly. What said'st thou? No, no! I did not dare call, Ferdinand! Lest I should hear no answer. A brief while, Belike, I lost all thought and memory Of that for which I came! After that pause, O God! I heard a groan!—and follow'd it. And yet another groan—which guided me Into a strange recess—and there was light, A hideous light! his torch lay on the ground— Its flame burnt dimly o'er a chasm's brink. I spake—and while I spake, a feeble groan Came from that chasm! It was his last! his death groan! Maurice. Comfort her, comfort her, Almighty Father! Alhadra. I stood in unimaginable trance And agony, that cannot be remember'd, Listening with horrid hope to hear a groan! But I had heard his last—my husband's death-groan! Naomi. Haste! let us go! Alhadra. I look'd far down the pit. My sight was bounded by a jutting fragment, And it was stain'd with blood! Then first I shriek'd! My eyeballs burnt! my brain grew hot as fire! And all the hanging drops of the wet roof Turn'd into blood. I saw them turn to blood! And I was leaping wildly down the chasm When on the further brink I saw his sword, And it said, Vengeance! Curses on my tongue! The moon hath moved in heaven, and I am here, And he hath not had vengeance! Ferdinand! Spirit of Ferdinand! thy murderer lives! Away! away! [She rushes off, all following. END OF THE FOURTH ACT ACT THE FIFTH Scene the First. —The Sea Shore. Naomi and a Moresco. Moresco. This was no time for freaks of useless vengeance. Naomi. True! but Francesco, the Inquisitor, Thou know'st the bloodhound—'twas a strong temptation. And when they pass'd within a mile of his house, We could not curb them in. They swore by Mahomet, It were a deed of treachery to their brethren To sail from Spain and leave that man alive. Moresco. Where is Alhadra? Naomi. She moved steadily on Unswerving from the path of her resolve. Yet each strange object fix'd her eye: for grief Doth love to dally with fantastic shapes, And smiling, like a sickly moralist, Gives some resemblance of her own concerns To the straws of chance, and things inanimate. I seek her here; stand thou upon the watch. [Exit Moresco. Naomi (looking wistfully to the distance). Stretch'd on the rock! It must be she—Alhadra! [Alhadra rises from the rock, and advances slowly, as if musing. Naomi. Once more, well met! what ponder'st thou so deeply? Alhadra. I scarce can tell thee! For my many thoughts Troubled me, till with blank and naked mind I only listen'd to the dashing billows. It seems to me, I could have closed my eyes And wak'd without a dream of what has pass'd; So well it counterfeited quietness, This wearied heart of mine! Naomi. 'Tis thus by nature Wisely ordain'd, that so excess of sorrow Might bring its own cure with it. Alhadra. Would to Heaven That it had brought its last and certain cure! That ruin in the wood. Naomi. It is a place Of ominous fame; but 'twas the shortest road, Nor could we else have kept clear of the village. Yet some among us, as they scal'd the wall, Mutter'd old rhyming prayers. Alhadra. On that broad wall I saw a skull; a poppy grew beside it, There was a ghastly solace in the sight! Naomi. I mark'd it not, and in good truth the night-bird Curdled my blood, even till it prick'd the heart. Its note comes dreariest in the fall of the year: [Looking round impatiently. Why don't they come? I will go forth and meet them. [Exit Naomi. Alhadra (alone). The hanging woods, that touch'd by autumn seem'd As they were blossoming hues of fire and gold, The hanging woods, most lovely in decay, The many clouds, the sea, the rock, the sands, Lay in the silent moonshine; and the owl, (Strange! very strange!) the scritch owl only wak'd, Sole voice, sole eye of all that world of beauty! Why such a thing am I! Where are these men? I need the sympathy of human faces To beat away this deep contempt for all things Which quenches my revenge. Oh!—would to Alla The raven and the sea-mew were appointed To bring me food, or rather that my soul Could drink in life from the universal air! It were a lot divine in some small skiff, Along some ocean's boundless solitude, To float for ever with a careless course, And think myself the only being alive! [Naomi re-enters. Naomi. Thy children— Alhadra. Children? Whose children? [A pause—then fiercely. Son of Velez, This hath new-strung my arm! Thou coward tyrant, To stupify a woman's heart with anguish, Till she forgot even that she was a mother! [A noise—enter a part of the Morescoes; and from the opposite side of the stage a Moorish Seaman. Moorish Seaman. The boat is on the shore, the vessel waits. Your wives and children are already stow'd; I left them prattling of the Barbary coast, Of Mosks, and minarets, and golden crescents. Each had her separate dream; but all were gay, Dancing, in thought, to finger-beaten timbrels! [Enter Maurice and the rest of the Morescoes dragging in Francesco. Francesco. O spare me, spare me! only spare my life! An Old Man. All hail, Alhadra! O that thou hadst heard him When first we dragg'd him forth! [Then turning to the band. Here! in her presence— [He advances with his sword as about to kill him. Maurice leaps in and stands with his drawn sword between Francesco and the Morescoes. Maurice. Nay, but ye shall not! Old Man. Shall not? Hah? Shall not? Maurice. What, an unarm'd man? A man that never wore a sword? A priest? It is unsoldierly! I say, ye shall not! Old Man (turning to the bands). He bears himself most like an insolent Spaniard! Maurice. And ye like slaves, that have destroy'd their master, But know not yet what freedom means; how holy And just a thing it is! He's a fall'n foe! Come, come, forgive him! All. No, by Mahomet! Francesco. O mercy, mercy! talk to them of mercy! Old Man. Mercy to thee! No, no, by Mahomet! Maurice. Nay, Mahomet taught mercy and forgiveness. I am sure he did! Old Man. Ha! Ha! Forgiveness! Mercy! Maurice. If he did not, he needs it for himself! Alhadra. Blaspheming fool! the law of Mahomet Was given by him, who framed the soul of man. This the best proof—it fits the soul of man! Ambition, glory, thirst of enterprize, The deep and stubborn purpose of revenge, With all the boiling revelries of pleasure— These grow in the heart, yea, intertwine their roots With its minutest fibres! And that Being Who made us, laughs to scorn the lying faith, Whose puny precepts, like a wall of sand, Would stem the full tide of predestined Nature! Naomi (who turns toward Francesco with his sword). Speak! All (to Alhadra). Speak! Alhadra. Is the murderer of your chieftain dead? Now as God liveth, who hath suffer'd him To make my children orphans, none shall die Till I have seen his blood! Off with him to the vessel! [A part of the Morescoes hurry him off. Alhadra. The Tyger, that with unquench'd cruelty, Still thirsts for blood, leaps on the hunter's spear With prodigal courage. 'Tis not so with man. Maurice. It is not so, remember that, my friends! Cowards are cruel, and the cruel cowards. Alhadra. Scatter yourselves, take each a separate way, And move in silence to the house of Velez. [Exeunt. Scene. —A Dungeon. Albert (alone) rises slowly from a bed of reeds. Albert. And this place my forefathers made for men! This is the process of our love and wisdom To each poor brother who offends against us— Most innocent, perhaps—and what if guilty? Is this the only cure? Merciful God! Each pore and natural outlet shrivell'd up By ignorance and parching poverty, His energies roll back upon his heart, And stagnate and corrupt till changed to poison, They break out on him like a loathsome plague-spot! Then we call in our pamper'd mountebanks— And this is their best cure! uncomforted And friendless solitude, groaning and tears, And savage faces at the clanking hour Seen thro' the steaming vapours of his dungeon By the lamp's dismal twilight! So he lies Circled with evil, till his very soul Unmoulds its essence, hopelessly deform'd By sights of ever more deformity! With other ministrations thou, O Nature! Healest thy wandering and distemper'd child: Thou pourest on him thy soft influences, Thy sunny hues, fair forms, and breathing sweets, Thy melodies of woods, and winds, and waters, Till he relent, and can no more endure To be a jarring and a dissonant thing Amid this general dance and minstrelsy; But bursting into tears wins back his way, His angry spirit heal'd and harmoniz'd By the benignant touch of love and beauty. [A noise at the dungeon-door. It opens, and Osorio enters with a goblet in his hand. Osorio. Hail, potent wizard! In my gayer mood I pour'd forth a libation to old Pluto; And as I brimm'd the bowl, I thought of thee! Albert (in a low voice). I have not summon'd up my heart to give That pang, which I must give thee, son of Velez! Osorio (with affected levity). Thou hast conspired against my life and honour, Hast trick'd me foully; yet I hate thee not! Why should I hate thee? This same world of ours— It is a puddle in a storm of rain, And we the air-bladders, that course up and down, And joust and tilt in merry tournament, And when one bubble runs foul of another, [Waving his hand at Albert. The lesser must needs break! Albert. I see thy heart! There is a frightful glitter in thine eye, Which doth betray thee. Crazy-conscienc'd man, This is the gaiety of drunken anguish, Which fain would scoff away the pang of guilt, And quell each human feeling! Osorio. Feeling! feeling! The death of a man—the breaking of a bubble. 'Tis true, I cannot sob for such misfortunes! But faintness, cold, and hunger—curses on me If willingly I e'er inflicted them! Come, share the beverage—this chill place demands it. Friendship and wine! [Osorio proffers him the goblet. Albert. Yon insect on the wall, Which moves this way and that its hundred legs, Were it a toy of mere mechanic craft, It were an infinitely curious thing! But it has life, Osorio! life and thought; And by the power of its miraculous will Wields all the complex movements of its frame Unerringly, to pleasurable ends! Saw I that insect on this goblet's brink, I would remove it with an eager terror. Osorio. What meanest thou? Albert. There's poison in the wine. Osorio. Thou hast guess'd well. There's poison in the wine. Shall we throw dice, which of us two shall drink it? For one of us must die! Albert. Whom dost thou think me? Osorio. The accomplice and sworn friend of Ferdinand. Albert. Ferdinand! Ferdinand! 'tis a name I know not. Osorio. Good! good! that lie! by Heaven! it has restor'd me. Now I am thy master! Villain, thou shalt drink it, Or die a bitterer death. Albert. What strange solution Hast thou found out to satisfy thy fears, And drug them to unnatural sleep? [Albert takes the goblet, and with a sigh throws it on the ground. My master! Osorio. Thou mountebank! Albert. Mountebank and villain! What then art thou? For shame, put up thy sword! What boots a weapon in a wither'd arm? I fix mine eye upon thee, and thou tremblest! I speak—and fear and wonder crush thy rage, And turn it to a motionless distraction! Thou blind self-worshipper! thy pride, thy cunning, Thy faith in universal villainy, Thy shallow sophisms, thy pretended scorn For all thy human brethren—out upon them! What have they done for thee? Have they given thee peace? Cured thee of starting in thy sleep? or made The darkness pleasant, when thou wakest at midnight? Art happy when alone? can'st walk by thyself With even step, and quiet cheerfulness? Yet, yet thou mayst be saved. Osorio (stupidly reiterating the word). Saved? saved? Albert. One pang— Could I call up one pang of true remorse! Osorio. He told me of the babe, that prattled to him, His fatherless little ones! Remorse! remorse! Where gott'st thou that fool's word? Curse on remorse! Can it give up the dead, or recompact A mangled body—mangled, dash'd to atoms! Not all the blessings of an host of angels Can blow away a desolate widow's curse; And tho' thou spill thy heart's blood for atonement, It will not weigh against an orphan's tear. Albert (almost overcome by his feelings). But Albert— Osorio. Ha! it chokes thee in the throat, Even thee! and yet, I pray thee, speak it out. Still Albert! Albert! Howl it in mine ear! Heap it, like coals of fire, upon my heart! And shoot it hissing through my brain! Albert. Alas— That day, when thou didst leap from off the rock Into the waves, and grasp'd thy sinking brother, And bore him to the strand, then, son of Velez! How sweet and musical the name of Albert! Then, then, Osorio! he was dear to thee, And thou wert dear to him. Heaven only knows How very dear thou wert! Why didst thou hate him? O Heaven! how he would fall upon thy neck, And weep forgiveness! Osorio. Spirit of the dead! Methinks I know thee! Ha!—my brain turns wild At its own dreams—off—off, fantastic shadow! Albert (seizing his hand). I fain would tell thee what I am, but dare not! Osorio (retiring from him). Cheat, villain, traitor! whatsoe'er thou be I fear thee, man! [He starts, and stands in the attitude of listening. And is this too my madness? Albert. It is the step of one that treads in fear Seeking to cheat the echo. Osorio. It approaches— This nook shall hide me. [Maria enters from a plank which slips to and fro. Maria. I have put aside The customs and the terrors of a woman, To work out thy escape. Stranger! begone, And only tell me what thou know'st of Albert. [Albert takes her portrait from his neck, and gives it her with unutterable tenderness. Albert. Maria! my Maria! Maria. Do not mock me. This is my face—and thou—ha! who art thou? Nay, I will call thee Albert! [She falls upon his neck. Osorio leaps out from the nook with frantic wildness, and rushes towards Albert with his sword. Maria gazes at him, as one helpless with terror, then leaves Albert, and flings herself upon Osorio, arresting his arm. Maria. Madman, stop! Albert (with majesty and tenderness). Does then this thin disguise impenetrably Hide Albert from thee? Toil and painful wounds, And long imprisonment in unwholesome dungeons, Have marr'd perhaps all trace and lineament Of what I was! But chiefly, chiefly, brother! My anguish for thy guilt. Spotless Maria, I thought thee guilty too! Osorio, brother! Nay, nay, thou shalt embrace me! Osorio (drawing back and gazing at Albert with a countenance expressive at once of awe and terror). Touch me not! Touch not pollution, Albert!—I will die! [He attempts to fall on his sword. Albert and Maria struggle with him. Albert. We will invent some tale to save your honour. Live, live, Osorio! Maria. You may yet be happy. Osorio (looking at Maria). O horror! Not a thousand years in heaven Could recompose this miserable heart, Or make it capable of one brief joy. Live! live!—why yes! 'Twere well to live with you— For is it fit a villain should be proud? My brother! I will kneel to you, my brother! [Throws himself at Albert's feet. Forgive me, Albert!—Curse me with forgiveness! Albert. Call back thy soul, my brother! and look round thee. Now is the time for greatness. Think that Heaven— Maria. O mark his eye! he hears not what you say. Osorio (pointing at vacancy). Yes, mark his eye! there's fascination in it. Thou said'st thou didst not know him. That is he! He comes upon me! Albert (lifting his eye to heaven). Heal, O heal him, Heaven! Osorio. Nearer and nearer! And I cannot stir! Will no one hear these stifled groans, and wake me? He would have died to save me, and I kill'd him— A husband and a father! Maria. Some secret poison Drinks up his spirit! Osorio (fiercely recollecting himself). Let the eternal Justice Prepare my punishment in the obscure world. I will not bear to live—to live! O agony! And be myself alone, my own sore torment! [The doors of the dungeon are burst open with a crash. Alhadra, Maurice, and the band of Morescoes enter. Alhadra (pointing at Osorio). Seize first that man! [The Moors press round. Albert (rushing in among them). Draw thy sword, Maurice, and defend my brother. [A scuffle, during which they disarm Maurice. Osorio. Off, ruffians! I have flung away my sword. Woman, my life is thine! to thee I give it. Off! he that touches me with his hand of flesh, I'll rend his limbs asunder! I have strength With this bare arm to scatter you like ashes! Alhadra. My husband— Osorio. Yes! I murder'd him most foully. Albert (throws himself on the earth). O horrible! Alhadra. Why didst thou leave his children? Demon! thou shouldst have sent thy dogs of hell To lap their blood. Then, then, I might have harden'd My soul in misery, and have had comfort. I would have stood far off, quiet tho' dark, And bade the race of men raise up a mourning For the deep horror of a desolation Too great to be one soul's particular lot! Brother of Zagri! let me lean upon thee. [Struggling to suppress her anguish.The time is not yet come for woman's anguish— I have not seen his blood. Within an hour Those little ones will crowd around and ask me, Where is our father? [Looks at Osorio. I shall curse thee then! Wert thou in heaven, my curse would pluck thee thence! Maria. See—see! he doth repent. I kneel to thee. Be merciful! [Maria kneels to her. Alhadra regards her face wistfully. Alhadra. Thou art young and innocent; 'Twere merciful to kill thee! Yet I will not. And for thy sake none of this house shall perish, Save only he. Maria. That aged man, his father! Alhadra (sternly). Why had he such a son? [The Moors press on. Maria (still kneeling, and wild with affright). Yet spare his life! They must not murder him! Alhadra. And is it then An enviable lot to waste away With inward wounds, and like the spirit of chaos To wander on disquietly thro' the earth, Cursing all lovely things? to let him live— It were a deep revenge! All the band cry out —No mercy! no mercy! [Naomi advances with the sword towards Osorio. Alhadra. Nay, bear him forth! Why should this innocent maid Behold the ugliness of death? Osorio (with great majesty). O woman! I have stood silent like a slave before thee, That I might taste the wormwood and the gall, And satiate this self-accusing spirit With bitterer agonies than death can give. [The Moors gather round him in a crowd, and pass off the stage. Alhadra. I thank thee, Heaven! thou hast ordain'd it wisely, That still extremes bring their own cure. That point In misery which makes the oppressed man Regardless of his own life, makes him too Lord of the oppressor's! Knew I an hundred men Despairing, but not palsied by despair, This arm should shake the kingdoms of this world; The deep foundations of iniquity Should sink away, earth groaning from beneath them; The strong holds of the cruel men should fall, Their temples and their mountainous towers should fall; Till desolation seem'd a beautiful thing, And all that were and had the spirit of life Sang a new song to him who had gone forth Conquering and still to conquer! THE END THE PICCOLOMINI OR, THE FIRST PART OF WALLENSTEIN A DRAMA TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN OF SCHILLER PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION It was my intention to have prefixed a Life of Wallenstein to this translation; but I found that it must either have occupied a space wholly disproportionate to the nature of the publication, or have been merely a meagre catalogue of events narrated not more fully than they already are in the Play itself. The recent translation, likewise, of Schiller's History of the Thirty Years' War diminished the motives thereto. In the translation I endeavoured to render my Author literally wherever I was not prevented by absolute differences of idiom; but I am conscious that in two or three short passages I have been guilty of dilating the original; and, from anxiety to give the full meaning, have weakened the force. In the metre I have availed myself of no other liberties than those which Schiller had permitted to himself, except the occasional breaking-up of the line by the substitution of a trochee for an iambus; of which liberty, so frequent in our tragedies, I find no instance in these dramas. S. T. Coleridge. In 1800 the following table of Dramatis Personae was prefixed to Act I of The Piccolomini, or The First Part of Wallenstein. In 1828, 1829, and 1834 this table was omitted.

Valet de Chambre of Count Piccolomini. ACT I Scene I An old Gothic Chamber in the Council House at Pilsen, decorated with Colours and other War Insignia. Illo with Butler and Isolani. Illo. Ye have come late—but ye are come! The distance, Count Isolan, excuses your delay. Isolani. Add this too, that we come not empty-handed. At Donauwert it was reported to us, A Swedish caravan was on its way Transporting a rich cargo of provision, Almost six hundred waggons. This my Croats Plunged down upon and seized, this weighty prize!— We bring it hither— Illo. Just in time to banquet The illustrious company assembled here. Butler. 'Tis all alive! a stirring scene here! Isolani. Ay! The very churches are all full of soldiers. And in the Council-house, too, I observe, You're settled, quite at home! Well, well! we soldiers Must shift and suit us in what way we can. Illo. We have the Colonels here of thirty regiments. You'll find Count Tertsky here, and Tiefenbach, Kolatto, Goetz, Maradas, Hinnersam, The Piccolomini, both son and father— You'll meet with many an unexpected greeting From many an old friend and acquaintance. Only Galas is wanting still, and Altringer. Butler. Expect not Galas. Illo. How so? Do you know— Isolani. Max Piccolomini here?—O bring me to him. I see him yet, ('tis now ten years ago, We were engaged with Mansfeld hard by Dessau) I see the youth, in my mind's eye I see him, Leap his black war-horse from the bridge adown, And t'ward his father, then in extreme peril, Beat up against the strong tide of the Elbe. The down was scarce upon his chin! I hear He has made good the promise of his youth, And the full hero now is finished in him. Illo. You'll see him yet ere evening. He conducts The Duchess Friedland hither, and the Princess From Carnthen. We expect them here at noon. Butler. Both wife and daughter does the Duke call hither? He crowds in visitants from all sides. Isolani. Hm! So much the better! I had framed my mind To hear of nought but warlike circumstance, Of marches, and attacks, and batteries: And lo! the Duke provides, that something too Of gentler sort, and lovely, should be present To feast our eyes. Illo (aside to Butler). And how came you to know That the Count Galas joins us not? Butler. Because He importuned me to remain behind. Illo. And you?—You hold out firmly? Noble Butler! Butler. After the obligation which the Duke Had laid so newly on me— Illo. I had forgotten A pleasant duty—Major-General, I wish you joy! Isolani. What, you mean, of his regiment? I hear, too, that to make the gift still sweeter, The Duke has given him the very same In which he first saw service, and since then, Worked himself, step by step, through each preferment, From the ranks upwards. And verily, it gives A precedent of hope, a spur of action To the whole corps, if once in their remembrance An old deserving soldier makes his way. Butler. I am perplexed and doubtful, whether or no I dare accept this your congratulation. The Emperor has not yet confirmed the appointment. Isolani. Seize it, friend! Seize it! The hand which in that post Placed you, is strong enough to keep you there, Spite of the Emperor and his Ministers! Illo. Ay, if we would but so consider it!— If we would all of us consider it so! The Emperor gives us nothing; from the Duke Comes all—whate'er we hope, whate'er we have. Isolani (to Illo). My noble brother! did I tell you how The Duke will satisfy my creditors? Will be himself my banker for the future, Make me once more a creditable man!— And this is now the third time, think of that! This kingly-minded man has rescued me From absolute ruin, and restored my honour. Illo. O that his power but kept pace with his wishes! Why, friend! he'd give the whole world to his soldiers. But at Vienna, brother! here's the grievance!— What politic schemes do they not lay to shorten His arm, and, where they can, to clip his pinions. Then these new dainty requisitions! these, Which this same Questenberg brings hither!— Butler. Ay, These requisitions of the Emperor,— I too have heard about them; but I hope The Duke will not draw back a single inch! Illo. Not from his right most surely, unless first —From office! Butler. Know you aught then? You alarm me. Isolani (at the same time with Butler, and in a hurrying voice). We should be ruined, every one of us! Illo. No more! Yonder I see our worthy friend approaching With the Lieutenant-General, Piccolomini. Butler. I fear we shall not go hence as we came. Scene II Enter Octavio Piccolomini and Questenberg. Octavio. Ay, ay! more still! Still more new visitors! Acknowledge, friend! that never was a camp, Which held at once so many heads of heroes. Welcome, Count Isolani! Isolani. My noble brother, Even now am I arrived; it had been else my duty— Octavio. And Colonel Butler—trust me, I rejoice Thus to renew acquaintance with a man Whose worth and services I know and honour. See, see, my friend! There might we place at once before our eyes The sum of war's whole trade and mystery— [To Questenberg, presenting Butler and Isolani at the same time to him. These two the total sum—Strength and Dispatch. Questenberg (to Octavio). And lo! betwixt them both experienced Prudence! Octavio (presenting Questenberg to Butler and Isolani). The Chamberlain and War-commissioner Questenberg, The bearer of the Emperor's behests, The long-tried friend and patron of all soldiers, We honour in this noble visitor. Illo. 'Tis not the first time, noble Minister, You have shewn our camp this honour. Questenberg. Once before I stood before these colours. Illo. Perchance too you remember where that was. It was at Znäim in Moravia, where You did present yourself upon the part Of the Emperor, to supplicate our Duke That he would straight assume the chief command. Questenberg. To supplicate? Nay, noble General! So far extended neither my commission (At least to my own knowledge) nor my zeal. Illo. Well, well, then—to compel him, if you choose. I can remember me right well, Count Tilly Had suffered total rout upon the Lech. Bavaria lay all open to the enemy, Whom there was nothing to delay from pressing Onwards into the very heart of Austria. At that time you and Werdenberg appeared Before our General, storming him with prayers, And menacing the Emperor's displeasure, Unless he took compassion on this wretchedness. Isolani. Yes, yes, 'tis comprehensible enough, Wherefore with your commission of to-day You were not all too willing to remember Your former one. Questenberg. Why not, Count Isolan? No contradiction sure exists between them. It was the urgent business of that time To snatch Bavaria from her enemy's hand; And my commission of to-day instructs me To free her from her good friends and protectors. Illo. A worthy office! After with our blood We have wrested this Bohemia from the Saxon, To be swept out of it is all our thanks, The sole reward of all our hard-won victories. Questenberg. Unless that wretched land be doomed to suffer Only a change of evils, it must be Freed from the scourge alike of friend and foe. Illo. What? 'Twas a favourable year; the Boors Can answer fresh demands already. Questenberg. Nay, If you discourse of herds and meadow-grounds— Isolani. The war maintains the war. Are the Boors ruined, The Emperor gains so many more new soldiers. Questenberg. And is the poorer by even so many subjects. Isolani. Poh! We are all his subjects. Questenberg. Yet with a difference, General! The one fill With profitable industry the purse, The others are well skilled to empty it. The sword has made the Emperor poor; the plough Must reinvigorate his resources. Isolani. Sure! Times are not yet so bad. Methinks I see [Examining with his eye the dress and ornaments of Questenberg. Good store of gold that still remains uncoined. Questenberg. Thank Heaven! that means have been found out to hide Some little from the fingers of the Croats. Illo. There! The Stawata and the Martinitz, On whom the Emperor heaps his gifts and graces, To the heart-burning of all good Bohemians— Those minions of court favour, those court harpies, Who fatten on the wrecks of citizens Driven from their house and home—who reap no harvests Save in the general calamity— Who now, with kingly pomp, insult and mock The desolation of their country—these, Let these, and such as these, support the war, The fatal war, which they alone enkindled! Butler. And those state-parasites, who have their feet So constantly beneath the Emperor's table, Who cannot let a benefice fall, but they Snap at it with dog's hunger—they, forsooth, Would pare the soldier's bread, and cross his reckoning! Isolani. My life long will it anger me to think, How when I went to court seven years ago, To see about new horses for our regiment, How from one antechamber to another They dragged me on, and left me by the hour To kick my heels among a crowd of simpering Feast-fattened slaves, as if I had come thither A mendicant suitor for the crumbs of favour That fall beneath their tables. And, at last, Whom should they send me but a Capuchin! Straight I began to muster up my sins For absolution—but no such luck for me! This was the man, this Capuchin, with whom I was to treat concerning the army horses: And I was forced at last to quit the field, The business unaccomplished. Afterwards The Duke procured me in three days, what I Could not obtain in thirty at Vienna. Questenberg. Yes, yes! your travelling bills soon found their way to us: Too well I know we have still accounts to settle. Illo. War is a violent trade; one cannot always Finish one's work by soft means; every trifle Must not be blackened into sacrilege. If we should wait till you, in solemn council, With due deliberation had selected The smallest out of four-and-twenty evils, I'faith, we should wait long.— ‘Dash! and through with it!’—That's the better watchword. Then after come what may come. 'Tis man's nature To make the best of a bad thing once past. A bitter and perplexed ‘what shall I do?’ Is worse to man than worst necessity. Questenberg. Ay, doubtless, it is true: the Duke does spare us The troublesome task of choosing. Butler. Yes, the Duke Cares with a father's feelings for his troops; But how the Emperor feels for us, we see. Questenberg. His cares and feelings all ranks share alike, Nor will he offer one up to another. Isolani. And therefore thrusts he us into the deserts As beasts of prey, that so he may preserve His dear sheep fattening in his fields at home. Questenberg. Count, this comparison you make, not I. Butler. Why, were we all the Court supposes us, 'Twere dangerous, sure, to give us liberty. Questenberg. You have taken liberty—it was not given you. And therefore it becomes an urgent duty To rein it in with curbs. Octavio. My noble friend, This is no more than a remembrancing That you are now in camp, and among warriors. The soldier's boldness constitues his freedom. Could he act daringly, unless he dared Talk even so? One runs into the other. The boldness of this worthy officer, [pointing to Butler. Which now has but mistaken in its mark, Preserved, when nought but boldness could preserve it, To the Emperor his capital city, Prague, In a most formidable mutiny Of the whole garrison. [Military music at a distance. Hah! here they come! Illo. The sentries are saluting them: this signal Announces the arrival of the Duchess. Octavio. Then my son Max too has returned. 'Twas he Fetched and attended them from Carnthen hither. Isolani (to Illo). Shall we not go in company to greet them? Illo. Well, let us go.—Ho! Colonel Butler, come. [To Octavio. You'll not forget, that yet ere noon we meet The noble Envoy at the General's palace. [Exeunt all but Questenberg and Octavio. Scene III Questenberg and Octavio. Questenberg. What have I not been forced to hear, Octavio! What sentiments! what fierce, uncurbed defiance! And were this spirit universal— Octavio. Hm! You are now acquainted with three-fourths of the army. Questenberg. Where must we seek then for a second host To have the custody of this? That Illo Thinks worse, I fear me, than he speaks. And then This Butler too—he cannot even conceal The passionate workings of his ill intentions. Octavio. Quickness of temper—irritated pride; 'Twas nothing more. I cannot give up Butler. I know a spell that will soon dispossess The evil spirit in him. Questenberg. Friend, friend! O! this is worse, far worse, than we had suffered Ourselves to dream of at Vienna. There We saw it only with a courtier's eyes, Eyes dazzled by the splendour of the throne. We had not seen the War-Chief, the Commander, The man all-powerful in his camp. Here, here, 'Tis quite another thing. Here is no Emperor more—the Duke is Emperor. Alas, my friend! alas, my noble friend! This walk which you have ta'en me through the camp Strikes my hopes prostrate. Octavio. Now you see yourself Of what a perilous kind the office is, Which you deliver to me from the Court. The least suspicion of the General Costs me my freedom and my life, and would But hasten his most desperate enterprise. Questenberg. Where was our reason sleeping when we trusted This madman with the sword, and placed such power In such a hand? I tell you, he'll refuse, Flatly refuse, to obey the Imperial orders. Friend, he can do't, and what he can, he will. And then the impunity of his defiance— O! what a proclamation of our weakness! Octavio. D'ye think too, he has brought his wife and daughter Without a purpose hither? Here in camp! And at the very point of time, in which We're arming for the war? That he has taken These, the last pledges of his loyalty, Away from out the Emperor's domains— This is no doubtful token of the nearness Of some eruption! Questenberg. How shall we hold footing Beneath this tempest, which collects itself And threats us from all quarters? The enemy Of the empire on our borders, now already The master of the Danube, and still farther, And farther still, extending every hour! In our interior the alarum-bells Of insurrection—peasantry in arms— All orders discontented—and the army, Just in the moment of our expectation Of aidance from it—lo! this very army Seduced, run wild, lost to all discipline, Loosened, and rent asunder from the state And from their sovereign, the blind instrument Of the most daring of mankind, a weapon Of fearful power, which at his will he wields! Octavio. Nay, nay, friend! let us not despair too soon, Men's words are ever bolder than their deeds: And many a resolute, who now appears Made up to all extremes, will, on a sudden Find in his breast a heart he knew not of, Let but a single honest man speak out The true name of his crime! Remember, too, We stand not yet so wholly unprotected. Counts Altringer and Galas have maintained Their little army faithful to its duty, And daily it becomes more numerous. Nor can he take us by surprise: you know, I hold him all-encompassed by my listeners. Whate'er he does, is mine, even while 'tis doing— No step so small, but instantly I hear it; Yea, his own mouth discloses it. Questenberg. 'Tis quite Incomprehensible, that he detects not The foe so near! Octavio. Beware, you do not think, That I by lying arts, and complaisant Hypocrisy, have skulked into his graces: Or with the sustenance of smooth professions Nourish his all-confiding friendship! No— Compelled alike by prudence, and that duty Which we all owe our country, and our sovereign, To hide my genuine feelings from him, yet Ne'er have I duped him with base counterfeits! Questenberg. It is the visible ordinance of heaven. Octavio. I know not what it is that so attracts And links him both to me and to my son. Comrades and friends we always were—long habit, Adventurous deeds performed in company, And all those many and various incidents Which store a soldier's memory with affections, Had bound us long and early to each other— Yet I can name the day, when all at once His heart rose on me, and his confidence Shot out in sudden growth. It was the morning Before the memorable fight at Lützner. Urged by an ugly dream, I sought him out, To press him to accept another charger. At distance from the tents, beneath a tree, I found him in a sleep. When I had waked him, And had related all my bodings to him, Long time he stared upon me, like a man Astounded; thereon fell upon my neck, And manifested to me an emotion That far outstripped the worth of that small service. Since then his confidence has followed me With the same pace that mine has fled from him. Questenberg. You lead your son into the secret? Octavio. No! Questenberg. What? and not warn him either what bad hands His lot has placed him in? Octavio. I must perforce Leave him in wardship to his innocence. His young and open soul—dissimulation Is foreign to its habits! Ignorance Alone can keep alive the cheerful air, The unembarrassed sense and light free spirit, That make the Duke secure. Questenberg. My honoured friend! most highly do I deem Of Colonel Piccolomini—yet—if— Reflect a little— Octavio. I must venture it. Hush!—There he comes! Scene IV Max Piccolomini, Octavio Piccolomini, Questenberg. Max. Ha! there he is himself. Welcome, my father! You are engaged, I see. I'll not disturb you. Octavio. How, Max? Look closer at this visitor; Attention, Max, an old friend merits—Reverence Belongs of right to the envoy of your sovereign. Max. Von Questenberg!—Welcome—if you bring with you Aught good to our head quarters. Questenberg (seizing his hand). Nay, draw not Your hand away, Count Piccolomini! Not on mine own account alone I seized it, And nothing common will I say therewith. [Taking the hands of both. Octavio—Max Piccolomini! O saviour names, and full of happy omen! Ne'er will her prosperous genius turn from Austria, While two such stars, with blessed influences Beaming protection, shine above her hosts. Max. Heh!—Noble minister! You miss your part. You came not here to act a panegyric. You're sent, I know, to find fault and to scold us— I must not be beforehand with my comrades. Octavio. He comes from court, where people are not quite So well contented with the duke, as here. Max. What now have they contrived to find out in him? That he alone determines for himself What he himself alone doth understand? Well, therein he does right, and will persist in't. Heaven never meant him for that passive thing That can be struck and hammered out to suit Another's taste and fancy. He'll not dance To every tune of every minister. It goes against his nature—he can't do it. He is possessed by a commanding spirit, And his too is the station of command. And well for us it is so! There exist Few fit to rule themselves, but few that use Their intellects intelligently.—Then Well for the whole, if there be found a man, Who makes himself what nature destined him, The pause, the central point to thousand thousands— Stands fixed and stately, like a firm-built column, Where all may press with joy and confidence. Now such a man is Wallenstein; and if Another better suits the court—no other But such a one as he can serve the army. Questenberg. The army? Doubtless! Octavio (aside). Hush! suppress it, friend! Unless some end were answered by the utterance.— Of him there you'll make nothing. Max. In their distress They call a spirit up, and when he comes, Straight their flesh creeps and quivers, and they dread him More than the ills for which they called him up. The uncommon, the sublime, must seem and be Like things of every day.—But in the field, Aye, there the Present Being makes itself felt. The personal must command, the actual eye Examine. If to be the chieftain asks All that is great in nature, let it be Likewise his privilege to move and act In all the correspondencies of greatness. The oracle within him, that which lives, He must invoke and question—not dead books, Not ordinances, not mould-rotted papers. Octavio. My son! of those old narrow ordinances Let us not hold too lightly. They are weights Of priceless value, which oppressed mankind Tied to the volatile will of their oppressors. For always formidable was the league And partnership of free power with free will. The way of ancient ordinance, though it winds, Is yet no devious way. Straight forward goes The lightning's path, and straight the fearful path Of the cannon-ball. Direct it flies and rapid, Shattering that it may reach, and shattering what it reaches. My son! the road the human being travels, That on which blessing comes and goes, doth follow The river's course, the valley's playful windings, Curves round the corn-field and the hill of vines, Honouring the holy bounds of property! And thus secure, though late, leads to its end. Questenberg. O hear your father, noble youth! hear him, Who is at once the hero and the man. Octavio. My son, the nursling of the camp spoke in thee! A war of fifteen years Hath been thy education and thy school. Peace hast thou never witnessed! There exists A higher than the warrior's excellence. In war itself war is no ultimate purpose. The vast and sudden deeds of violence, Adventures wild, and wonders of the moment, These are not they, my son, that generate The calm, the blissful, and the enduring mighty! Lo there! the soldier, rapid architect! Builds his light town of canvas, and at once The whole scene moves and bustles momently, With arms, and neighing steeds, and mirth and quarrel The motley market fills; the roads, the streams Are crowded with new freights, trade stirs and hurries! But on some morrow morn, all suddenly, The tents drop down, the horde renews its march. Dreary, and solitary as a church-yard The meadow and down-trodden seed-plot lie, And the year's harvest is gone utterly. Max. O let the Emperor make peace, my father! Most gladly would I give the blood-stained laurel For the first violet of the leafless spring, Plucked in those quiet fields where I have journeyed! Octavio. What ails thee? What so moves thee all at once? Max. Peace have I ne'er beheld? I have beheld it. From thence am I come hither: O! that sight, It glimmers still before me, like some landscape Left in the distance,—some delicious landscape! My road conducted me through countries where The war has not yet reached. Life, life, my father— My venerable father, life has charms Which we have ne'er experienced. We have been But voyaging along its barren coasts, Like some poor ever-roaming horde of pirates, That, crowded in the rank and narrow ship, House on the wild sea with wild usages, Nor know aught of the main land, but the bays Where safeliest they may venture a thieves' landing. Whate'er in the inland dales the land conceals Of fair and exquisite, O! nothing, nothing, Do we behold of that in our rude voyage. Octavio. And so your journey has revealed this to you? Max. 'Twas the first leisure of my life. O tell me, What is the meed and purpose of the toil, The painful toil, which robbed me of my youth, Left me a heart unsoul'd and solitary, A spirit uninformed, unornamented. For the camp's stir and crowd and ceaseless larum, The neighing war-horse, the air-shattering trumpet, The unvaried, still-returning hour of duty, Word of command, and exercise of arms— There's nothing here, there's nothing in all this To satisfy the heart, the gasping heart! Mere bustling nothingness, where the soul is not— This cannot be the sole felicity, These cannot be man's best and only pleasures. Octavio. Much hast thou learnt, my son, in this short journey. Max. O! day thrice lovely! when at length the soldier Returns home into life; when he becomes A fellow-man among his fellow-men. The colours are unfurled, the cavalcade Marshals, and now the buzz is hushed, and hark! Now the soft peace-march beats, home, brothers, home! The caps and helmets are all garlanded With green boughs, the last plundering of the fields. The city gates fly open of themselves, They need no longer the petard to tear them. The ramparts are all filled with men and women, With peaceful men and women, that send onwards Kisses and welcomings upon the air, Which they make breezy with affectionate gestures. From all the towers rings out the merry peal, The joyous vespers of a bloody day. O happy man, O fortunate! for whom The well-known door, the faithful arms are open, The faithful tender arms with mute embracing. Questenberg. O! that you should speak Of such a distant, distant time, and not Of the to-morrow, not of this to-day. Max. Where lies the fault but on you in Vienna? I will deal openly with you, Questenberg. Just now, as first I saw you standing here, (I'll own it to you freely) indignation Crowded and pressed my inmost soul together. 'Tis ye that hinder peace, ye!—and the warrior, It is the warrior that must force it from you. Ye fret the General's life out, blacken him, Hold him up as a rebel, and Heaven knows What else still worse, because he spares the Saxons, And tries to awaken confidence in the enemy; Which yet's the only way to peace: for if War intermit not during war, how then And whence can peace come?—Your own plagues fall on you! Even as I love what's virtuous, hate I you. And here make I this vow, here pledge myself; My blood shall spurt out for this Wallenstein, And my heart drain off, drop by drop, ere ye Shall revel and dance jubilee o'er his ruin. [Exit. Scene V Questenberg, Octavio Piccolomini. Questenberg. Alas, alas! and stands it so? What, friend! and do we let him go away In this delusion—let him go away? Not call him back immediately, not open His eyes upon the spot? Octavio. He has now opened mine, And I see more than pleases me. Questenberg. What is it? Octavio. Curse on this journey! Questenberg. But why so? What is it? Octavio. Come, come along, friend! I must follow up The ominous track immediately. Mine eyes Are opened now, and I must use them. Come! [Draws Questenberg on with him. Questenberg. What now? Where go you then? Octavio. To her herself. Questenberg. To— Octavio. To the Duke. Come, let us go—'Tis done, 'tis done, I see the net that is thrown over him. O! he returns not to me as he went. Questenberg. Nay, but explain yourself. Octavio. And that I should not Foresee it, not prevent this journey! Wherefore Did I keep it from him?—You were in the right. I should have warned him! Now it is too late. Questenberg. But what's too late? Bethink yourself, my friend, That you are talking absolute riddles to me. Octavio. Come!—to the Duke's. 'Tis close upon the hour Which he appointed you for audience. Come! A curse, a threefold curse, upon this journey! [He leads Questenberg off. Scene VI Changes to a spacious chamber in the house of the Duke of Friedland.—Servants employed in putting the tables and chairs in order. During this enters Seni, like an old Italian doctor, in black, and clothed somewhat fantastically. He carries a white staff, with which he marks out the quarters of the heaven. First Servant. Come—to it, lads, to it! Make an end of it. I hear the sentry call out, ‘Stand to your arms!’ They will be there in a minute. Second Servant. Why were we not told before that the audience would be held here? Nothing prepared—no orders —no instructions— Third Servant. Ay, and why was the balcony-chamber countermanded, that with the great worked carpet?—there one can look about one. First Servant. Nay, that you must ask the mathematician there. He says it is an unlucky chamber. Second Servant. Poh! stuff and nonsense! That's what I call a hum. A chamber is a chamber; what much can the place signify in the affair? Seni. My son, there's nothing insignificant, Nothing! But yet in every earthly thing First and most principal is place and time. First Servant (to the Second). Say nothing to him, Nat. The Duke himself must let him have his own will. Seni (counts the chairs, half in a loud, half in a low voice, till he comes to eleven, which he repeats). Eleven! an evil number! Set twelve chairs. Twelve! twelve signs hath the zodiac: five and seven, The holy numbers, include themselves in twelve. Second Servant. And what may you have to object against eleven? I should like to know that now. Seni. Eleven is—transgression; eleven oversteps The ten commandments. Second Servant. That's good! and why do you call five an holy number? Seni. Five is the soul of man: for even as man Is mingled up of good and evil, so The five is the first number that's made up Of even and odd. Second Servant. The foolish old coxcomb! First Servant. Ey! let him alone though. I like to hear him; there is more in his words than can be seen at first sight. Third Servant. Off! They come. Second Servant. There! Out at the side-door. [They hurry off. Seni follows slowly. A page brings the staff of command on a red cushion, and places it on the table near the Duke's chair. They are announced from without, and the wings of the door fly open. Scene VII Wallenstein, Duchess. Wallenstein. You went then through Vienna, were presented To the Queen of Hungary? Duchess. Yes, and to the Empress too, And by both Majesties were we admitted To kiss the hand. Wallenstein. And how was it received, That I had sent for wife and daughter hither To the camp, in winter time? Duchess. I did even that Which you commissioned me to do. I told them, You had determined on our daughter's marriage, And wished, ere yet you went into the field, To shew the elected husband his betrothed. Wallenstein. And did they guess the choice which I had made? Duchess. They only hoped and wished it may have fallen Upon no foreign nor yet Lutheran noble. Wallenstein. And you—what do you wish, Elizabeth? Duchess. Your will, you know, was always mine. Wallenstein. Well, then? And in all else, of what kind and complexion Was your reception at the court? Hide nothing from me. How were you received? Duchess. O! my dear lord, all is not what it was. A cankerworm, my lord, a cankerworm Has stolen into the bud. Wallenstein. Ay! is it so! What, they were lax? they failed of the old respect? Duchess. Not of respect. No honours were omitted, No outward courtesy; but in the place Of condescending, confidential kindness, Familiar and endearing, there were given me Only these honours and that solemn courtesy. Ah! and the tenderness which was put on, It was the guise of pity, not of favour. No! Albrecht's wife, Duke Albrecht's princely wife, Count Harrach's noble daughter, should not so— Not wholly so should she have been received. Wallenstein. Yes, yes; they have ta'en offence. My latest conduct, They railed at it, no doubt. Duchess. O that they had! I have been long accustomed to defend you, To heal and pacify distempered spirits. No; no one railed at you. They wrapped them up, O Heaven! in such oppressive, solemn silence!— Here is no every-day misunderstanding, No transient pique, no cloud that passes over; Something most luckless, most unhealable, Has taken place. The Queen of Hungary Used formerly to call me her dear aunt, And ever at departure to embrace me— Wallenstein. Now she omitted it? Duchess. She did embrace me, But then first when I had already taken My formal leave, and when the door already Had closed upon me, then did she come out In haste, as she had suddenly bethought herself, And pressed me to her bosom, more with anguish Than tenderness. Wallenstein (seizes her hand soothingly). Nay, now collect yourself, And what of Eggenberg and Lichtenstein, And of our other friends there? Duchess. I saw none. Wallenstein. The Ambassador from Spain, who once was wont To plead so warmly for me?— Duchess. Silent, Silent! Wallenstein. These suns then are eclipsed for us. Henceforward Must we roll on, our own fire, our own light. Duchess. And were it—were it, my dear lord, in that Which moved about the court in buzz and whisper, But in the country let itself be heard Aloud—in that which Father Lamormain In sundry hints and— Wallenstein. Lamormain! what said he? Duchess. That you're accused of having daringly O'erstepped the powers entrusted to you, charged With traitorous contempt of the Emperor And his supreme behests. The proud Bavarian, He and the Spaniards stand up your accusers— That there's a storm collecting over you Of far more fearful menace than that former one Which whirled you headlong down at Regensburg. And people talk, said he, of—Ah!— Wallenstein. Proceed! Duchess. I cannot utter it! Wallenstein. Proceed! Duchess. They talk— Wallenstein. Well! Duchess. Of a second— Wallenstein. Second— Duchess. More disgraceful —Dismission. Wallenstein. Talk they? O! they force, they thrust me With violence, against my own will, onward! Duchess. O! if there yet be time, my husband! if By giving way and by submission, this Can be averted—my dear lord, give way! Win down your proud heart to it! Tell that heart It is your sovereign lord, your Emperor Before whom you retreat. O let no longer Low tricking malice blacken your good meaning With abhorred venomous glosses. Stand you up Shielded and helm'd and weapon'd with the truth, And drive before you into uttermost shame These slanderous liars! Few firm friends have we— You know it!—The swift growth of our good fortune It hath but set us up, a mark for hatred. What are we, if the sovereign's grace and favour Stand not before us? Scene VIII Enter the Countess Tertsky, leading in her hand the Princess Thekla, richly adorned with brilliants. Countess, Thekla, Wallenstein, Duchess. Countess. How, sister? What already upon business, And business of no pleasing kind I see, Ere he has gladdened at his child. The first Moment belongs to joy. Here, Friedland! father! This is thy daughter. (Thekla approaches with a shy and timid air, and bends herself as about to kiss his hand. He receives her in his arms, and remains standing for some time lost in the feeling of her presence.) Wallenstein. Yes! pure and lovely hath hope risen on me: I take her as the pledge of greater fortune. Duchess. 'Twas but a little child when you departed To raise up that great army for the Emperor: And after, at the close of the campaign, When you returned home out of Pomerania, Your daughter was already in the convent, Wherein she has remain'd till now. Wallenstein. The while We in the field here gave our cares and toils To make her great, and fight her a free way To the loftiest earthly good, lo! mother Nature Within the peaceful silent convent walls Has done her part, and out of her free grace Hath she bestowed on the beloved child The godlike; and now leads her thus adorned To meet her splendid fortune, and my hope. Duchess (to Thekla). Thou wouldst not have recognized thy father, Wouldst thou, my child? She counted scarce eight years, When last she saw your face. Thekla. O yes, yes, mother! At the first glance!—My father is not altered. The form, that stands before me, falsifies No feature of the image that hath lived So long within me! Wallenstein. The voice of my child! [Then after a pause. I was indignant at my destiny That it denied me a man-child to be Heir of my name and of my prosperous fortune, And re-illume my soon extinguished being In a proud line of princes. I wronged my destiny. Here upon this head So lovely in its maiden bloom will I Let fall the garland of a life of war, Nor deem it lost, if only I can wreath it Transmitted to a regal ornament, Around these beauteous brows. [He clasps her in his arms as Piccolomini enters. Scene IX Enter Max Piccolomini, and some time after Count Tertsky, the others remaining as before. Countess. There comes the Paladin who protected us. Wallenstein. Max! Welcome, ever welcome! Always wert thou The morning star of my best joys! Max. My General— Wallenstein. 'Till now it was the Emperor who rewarded thee, I but the instrument. This day thou hast bound The father to thee, Max! the fortunate father, And this debt Friedland's self must pay. Max. My prince! You made no common hurry to transfer it. I come with shame: yea, not without a pang! For scarce have I arrived here, scarce delivered The mother and the daughter to your arms, But there is brought to me from your equerry A splendid richly-plated hunting dress So to remunerate me for my troubles— Yes, yes, remunerate me! Since a trouble It must be, a mere office, not a favour Which I leapt forward to receive, and which I came already with full heart to thank you for. No! 'twas not so intended, that my business Should be my highest best good fortune! [Tertsky enters, and delivers letters to the Duke, which he breaks open hurryingly. Countess (to Max). Remunerate your trouble! For his joy He makes you recompense. 'Tis not unfitting For you, Count Piccolomini, to feel So tenderly—my brother it beseems To shew himself for ever great and princely. Thekla. Then I too must have scruples of his love: For his munificent hands did ornament me Ere yet the father's heart had spoken to me. Max. Yes; 'tis his nature ever to be giving And making happy. How my heart pours out Its all of thanks to him: O! how I seem To utter all things in the dear name Friedland. While I shall live, so long will I remain The captive of this name: in it shall bloom My every fortune, every lovely hope. Inextricably as in some magic ring In this name hath my destiny charm-bound me! Countess. My brother wishes us to leave him. Come. Wallenstein (turns himself round quick, collects himself, and speaks with cheerfulness to the Duchess). Once more I bid thee welcome to the camp, Thou art the hostess of this court. You, Max, Will now again administer your old office, While we perform the sovereign's business here. [Max Piccolomini offers the Duchess his arm, the Countess accompanies the Princess. Tertsky (calling after him). Max, we depend on seeing you at the meeting. Scene X Wallenstein, Count Tertsky. Wallenstein (to himself). She hath seen all things as they are—It is so And squares completely with my other notices. They have determined finally in Vienna, Have given me my successor already; It is the king of Hungary, Ferdinand, The Emperor's delicate son! he's now their saviour, He's the new star that's rising now! Of us They think themselves already fairly rid, And as we were deceased, the heir already Is entering on possession—Therefore—dispatch! [As he turns round he observes Tertsky, and gives him a letter. Count Altringer will have himself excused, And Galas too—I like not this! Tertsky. And if Thou loiterest longer, all will fall away, One following the other. Wallenstein. Altringer Is master of the Tyrole passes. I must forthwith Send some one to him, that he let not in The Spaniards on me from the Milanese. —Well, and the old Sesin, that ancient trader In contraband negotiations, he Has shewn himself again of late. What brings he From the Count Thur? Tertsky. The Count communicates, He has found out the Swedish chancellor At Halberstadt, where the convention's held, Who says, you've tired him out, and that he'll have No further dealings with you. Wallenstein. And why so? Tertsky. He says, you are never in earnest in your speeches, That you decoy the Swedes—to make fools of them, Will league yourself with Saxony against them, And at last make yourself a riddance of them With a paltry sum of money. Wallenstein. So then, doubtless, Yes, doubtless, this same modest Swede expects That I shall yield him some fair German tract For his prey and booty, that ourselves at last On our own soil and native territory, May be no longer our own lords and masters! An excellent scheme! No, no! They must be off, Off, off! away! we want no such neighbours. Tertsky. Nay, yield them up that dot, that speck of land— It goes not from your portion. If you win The game what matters it to you who pays it? Wallenstein. Off with them, off! Thou understand'st not this. Never shall it be said of me, I parcelled My native land away, dismembered Germany, Betrayed it to a foreigner, in order To come with stealthy tread, and filch away My own share of the plunder—Never! never!— No foreign power shall strike root in the empire, And least of all, these Goths! these hunger-wolves! Who send such envious, hot and greedy glances T'wards the rich blessings of our German lands! I'll have their aid to cast and draw my nets, But not a single fish of all the draught Shall they come in for. Tertsky. You will deal, however, More fairly with the Saxons? They lose patience While you shift ground and make so many curves. Say, to what purpose all these masks? Your friends Are plunged in doubts, baffled, and led astray in you. There's Oxenstirn, there's Arnheim—neither knows What he should think of your procrastinations. And in the end I prove the liar: all Passes through me. I have not even your hand-writing. Wallenstein. I never give my handwriting; thou knowest it. Tertsky. But how can it be known that you're in earnest, If the act follows not upon the word? You must yourself acknowledge, that in all Your intercourses hitherto with the enemy You might have done with safety all you have done, Had you meant nothing further than to gull him For the Emperor's service. Wallenstein (after a pause, during which he looks narrowly on Tertsky). And from whence dost thou know That I'm not gulling him for the Emperor's service? Whence knowest thou that I'm not gulling all of you? Dost thou know me so well? When made I thee The intendant of my secret purposes? I am not conscious that I ever open'd My inmost thoughts to thee. The Emperor, it is true, Hath dealt with me amiss; and if I would, I could repay him with usurious interest For the evil he hath done me. It delights me To know my power; but whether I shall use it, Of that, I should have thought that thou could'st speak No wiselier than thy fellows. Tertsky. So hast thou always played thy game with us. [Enter Illo. Scene XI Illo, Wallenstein, Tertsky. Wallenstein. How stand affairs without? Are they prepared? Illo. You'll find them in the very mood you wish. They know about the Emperor's requisitions, And are tumultuous. Wallenstein. How hath Isolan Declared himself? Illo. He's yours, both soul and body, Since you built up again his Faro-bank. Wallenstein. And which way doth Kolatto bend? Hast thou Made sure of Tiefenbach and Deodate? Illo. What Piccolomini does, that they do too. Wallenstein. You mean then I may venture somewhat with them? Illo. —If you are assured of the Piccolomini. Wallenstein. Not more assured of mine own self. Tertsky. And yet I would you trusted not so much to Octavio, The fox! Wallenstein. Thou teachest me to know my man? Sixteen campaigns I have made with that old warrior. Besides, I have his horoscope, We both are born beneath like stars—in short To this belongs its own particular aspect, If therefore thou canst warrant me the rest— Illo. There is among them all but this one voice, You must not lay down the command. I hear They mean to send a deputation to you. Wallenstein. If I'm in aught to bind myself to them, They too must bind themselves to me. Illo. Of course. Wallenstein. Their words of honour they must give, their oaths, Give them in writing to me, promising Devotion to my service unconditional. Illo. Why not? Tertsky. Devotion unconditional? The exception of their duties towards Austria They'll always place among the premises. With this reserve— Wallenstein. All unconditional! No premises, no reserves. Illo. A thought has struck me. Does not Count Tertsky give us a set banquet This evening? Tertsky. Yes; and all the Generals Have been invited. Illo (to Wallenstein). Say, will you here fully Commission me to use my own discretion? I'll gain for you the Generals' words of honour, Even as you wish. Wallenstein. Gain me their signatures! How you come by them, that is your concern. Illo. And if I bring it to you, black on white, That all the leaders who are present here Give themselves up to you, without condition; Say, will you then—then will you shew yourself In earnest, and with some decisive action Make trial of your luck? Wallenstein. The signatures! Gain me the signatures. Illo. Seize, seize the hour Ere it slips from you. Seldom comes the moment In life, which is indeed sublime and weighty. To make a great decision possible, O! many things, all transient and all rapid, Must meet at once: and, haply, they thus met May by that confluence be enforced to pause Time long enough for wisdom, though too short, Far, far too short a time for doubt and scruple! This is that moment. See, our army chieftains, Our best, our noblest, are assembled around you, Their kinglike leader! On your nod they wait. The single threads, which here your prosperous fortune Hath woven together in one potent web Instinct with destiny, O let them not Unravel of themselves. If you permit These chiefs to separate, so unanimous Bring you them not a second time together. 'Tis the high tide that heaves the stranded ship, And every individual's spirit waxes In the great stream of multitudes. Behold They are still here, here still! But soon the war Bursts them once more asunder, and in small Particular anxieties and interests Scatters their spirit, and the sympathy Of each man with the whole. He, who to-day Forgets himself, forced onward with the stream, Will become sober, seeing but himself, Feel only his own weakness, and with speed Will face about, and march on in the old High road of duty, the old broad-trodden road, And seek but to make shelter in good plight. Wallenstein. The time is not yet come. Tertsky. So you say always. But when will it be time? Wallenstein. When I shall say it. Illo. You'll wait upon the stars, and on their hours, Till the earthly hour escapes you. O, believe me, In your own bosom are your destiny's stars. Confidence in yourself, prompt resolution, This is your Venus! and the sole malignant, The only one that harmeth you is Doubt. Wallenstein. Thou speakest as thou understand'st. How oft And many a time I've told thee, Jupiter, That lustrous god, was setting at thy birth. Thy visual power subdues no mysteries; Mole-eyed, thou mayest but burrow in the earth, Blind as that subterrestrial, who with wan, Lead-coloured shine lighted thee into life. The common, the terrestrial, thou mayest see, With serviceable cunning knit together The nearest with the nearest; and therein I trust thee and believe thee! but whate'er Full of mysterious import Nature weaves, And fashions in the depths—the spirit's ladder, That from this gross and visible world of dust Even to the starry world, with thousand rounds, Builds itself up; on which the unseen powers Move up and down on heavenly ministries— The circles in the circles, that approach The central sun with ever-narrowing orbit— These see the glance alone, the unsealed eye, Of Jupiter's glad children born in lustre. [He walks across the chamber, then returns, and standing still, proceeds. The heavenly constellations make not merely The day and nights, summer and spring, not merely Signify to the husbandman the seasons Of sowing and of harvest. Human action, That is the seed too of contingencies, Strewed on the dark land of futurity In hopes to reconcile the powers of fate. Whence it behoves us to seek out the seed-time, To watch the stars, select their proper hours, And trace with searching eye the heavenly houses, Whether the enemy of growth and thriving Hide himself not, malignant, in his corner. Therefore permit me my own time. Meanwhile Do you your part. As yet I cannot say What I shall do—only, give way I will not. Depose me too they shall not. On these points You may rely. Page (entering). My Lords, the Generals. Wallenstein. Let them come in. Scene XII Wallenstein, Tertsky, Illo.—To them enter Questenberg, Octavio, and Max Piccolomini, Butler, Isolani, Maradas, and three other Generals. Wallenstein motions Questenberg, who in consequence takes the Chair directly opposite to him; the others follow, arranging themselves according to their rank. Wallenstein. I have understood, 'tis true, the sum and import Of your instructions, Questenberg, have weighed them, And formed my final, absolute resolve; Yet it seems fitting, that the Generals Should hear the will of the Emperor from your mouth. May't please you then to open your commission Before these noble Chieftains. Questenberg. I am ready To obey you; but will first entreat your Highness, And all these noble Chieftains, to consider, The Imperial dignity and sovereign right Speaks from my mouth, and not my own presumption. Wallenstein. We excuse all preface. Questenberg. When his Majesty The Emperor to his courageous armies Presented in the person of Duke Friedland A most experienced and renowned commander, He did it in glad hope and confidence To give thereby to the fortune of the war A rapid and auspicious change. The onset Was favourable to his royal wishes. Bohemia was delivered from the Saxons, The Swede's career of conquest checked! These lands Began to draw breath freely, as Duke Friedland From all the streams of Germany forced hither The scattered armies of the enemy, Hither invoked as round one magic circle The Rhinegrave, Bernhard, Banner, Oxenstirn, Yea, and that never-conquered King himself; Here finally, before the eye of Nürnberg, The fearful game of battle to decide. Wallenstein. May't please you to the point. Questenberg. In Nürnberg's camp the Swedish monarch left His fame—in Lützen's plains his life. But who Stood not astounded, when victorious Friedland After this day of triumph, this proud day, Marched toward Bohemia with the speed of flight, And vanished from the theatre of war; While the young Weimar hero forced his way Into Franconia, to the Danube, like Some delving winter-stream, which, where it rushes, Makes its own channel; with such sudden speed He marched, and now at once 'fore Regenspurg Stood to the affright of all good Catholic Christians. Then did Bavaria's well-deserving Prince Entreat swift aidance in his extreme need; The Emperor sends seven horsemen to Duke Friedland, Seven horsemen couriers sends he with the entreaty: He superadds his own, and supplicates Where as the sovereign lord he can command. In vain his supplication! At this moment The Duke hears only his old hate and grudge, Barters the general good to gratify Private revenge—and so falls Regenspurg. Wallenstein. Max, to what period of the war alludes he? My recollection fails me here. Max. He means When we were in Silesia. Wallenstein. Ay! Is it so! But what had we to do there? Max. To beat out The Swedes and Saxons from the province. Wallenstein. True. In that description which the Minister gave I seemed to have forgotten the whole war. [To Questenberg. Well, but proceed a little. Questenberg. Yes! at length Beside the river Oder did the Duke Assert his ancient fame. Upon the fields Of Steinau did the Swedes lay down their arms, Subdued without a blow. And here, with others, The righteousness of Heaven to his avenger Delivered that long-practised stirrer-up Of insurrection, that curse-laden torch And kindler of this war, Matthias Thur. But he had fallen into magnanimous hands; Instead of punishment he found reward, And with rich presents did the Duke dismiss The arch-foe of his Emperor. Wallenstein (laughs). I know, I know you had already in Vienna Your windows and balconies all forestalled To see him on the executioner's cart. I might have lost the battle, lost it too With infamy, and still retained your graces— But, to have cheated them of a spectacle, Oh! that the good folks of Vienna never, No, never can forgive me. Questenberg. So Silesia Was freed, and all things loudly called the Duke Into Bavaria, now pressed hard on all sides. And he did put his troops in motion: slowly, Quite at his ease, and by the longest road He traverses Bohemia; but ere ever He hath once seen the enemy, faces round, Breaks up the march, and takes to winter quarters. Wallenstein. The troops were pitiably destitute Of every necessary, every comfort. The winter came. What thinks his Majesty His troops are made of? Arn't we men? subjected Like other men to wet, and cold, and all The circumstances of necessity? O miserable lot of the poor soldier! Wherever he comes in, all flee before him, And when he goes away, the general curse Follows him on his route. All must be seized, Nothing is given him. And compelled to seize From every man, he's every man's abhorrence. Behold, here stand my Generals. Karaffa! Count Deodate! Butler! Tell this man How long the soldiers' pay is in arrears. Butler. Already a full year. Wallenstein. And 'tis the hire That constitutes the hireling's name and duties, The soldier's pay is the soldier's covenant. Questenberg. Ah! this is a far other tone from that In which the Duke spoke eight, nine years ago. Wallenstein. Yes! 'tis my fault, I know it: I myself Have spoilt the Emperor by indulging him. Nine years ago, during the Danish war, I raised him up a force, a mighty force, Forty or fifty thousand men, that cost him Of his own purse no doit. Through Saxony The fury goddess of the war marched on, E'en to the surf-rocks of the Baltic, bearing The terrors of his name. That was a time! In the whole Imperial realm no name like mine Honoured with festival and celebration— And Albrecht Wallenstein, it was the title Of the third jewel in his crown! But at the Diet, when the Princes met At Regenspurg, there, there the whole broke out, There 'twas laid open, there it was made known, Out of what money-bag I had paid the host. And what was now my thank, what had I now, That I, a faithful servant of the Sovereign, Had loaded on myself the people's curses, And let the Princes of the empire pay The expenses of this war, that aggrandizes The Emperor alone—What thanks had I! What? I was offered up to their complaints, Dismissed, degraded! Questenberg. But your Highness knows What little freedom he possessed of action In that disastrous diet. Wallenstein. Death and hell! I had that which could have procured him freedom. No! Since 'twas proved so inauspicious to me To serve the Emperor at the empire's cost, I have been taught far other trains of thinking Of the empire, and the diet of the empire. From the Emperor, doubtless, I received this staff, But now I hold it as the empire's general— For the common weal, the universal interest, And no more for that one man's aggrandizement! But to the point. What is it that's desired of me? Questenberg. First, his imperial Majesty hath willed That without pretexts of delay the army Evacuate Bohemia. Wallenstein. In this season? And to what quarter wills the Emperor That we direct our course? Questenberg. To the enemy. His Majesty resolves, that Regenspurg Be purified from the enemy, ere Easter, That Lutheranism may be no longer preached In that cathedral, nor heretical Defilement desecrate the celebration Of that pure festival. Wallenstein. My generals, Can this be realized? Illo. 'Tis not possible. Butler. It can't be realized. Questenberg. The Emperor Already hath commanded Colonel Suys To advance toward Bavaria! Wallenstein. What did Suys? Questenberg. That which his duty prompted. He advanced! Wallenstein. What? he advanced? And I, his general, Had given him orders, peremptory orders, Not to desert his station! Stands it thus With my authority? Is this the obedience Due to my office, which being thrown aside No war can be conducted? Chieftains, speak! You be the judges, generals! What deserves That officer, who of his oath neglectful Is guilty of contempt of orders? Illo. Death. Wallenstein. Count Piccolomini! what has he deserved? Max Piccolomini. According to the letter of the law, Death. Isolani. Death. Butler. Death, by the laws of war. [Questenberg rises from his seat, Wallenstein follows; all the rest rise. Wallenstein. To this the law condemns him, and not I. And if I shew him favour, 'twill arise From the reverence that I owe my Emperor. Questenberg. If so, I can say nothing further—here! Wallenstein. I accepted the command but on conditions! And this the first, that to the diminution Of my authority no human being, Not even the Emperor's self, should be entitled To do aught, or to say aught, with the army. If I stand warranter of the event, Placing my honour and my head in pledge, Needs must I have full mastery in all The means thereto. What rendered this Gustavus Resistless, and unconquered upon earth? This—that he was the monarch in his army! A monarch, one who is indeed a monarch, Was never yet subdued but by his equal. But to the point! The best is yet to come. Attend now, generals! Questenberg. The prince Cardinal Begins his route at the approach of spring From the Milanese; and leads a Spanish army Through Germany into the Netherlands. That he may march secure and unimpeded, 'Tis the Emperor's will you grant him a detachment Of eight horse-regiments from the army here. Wallenstein. Yes, yes! I understand!—Eight regiments! Well, Right well concerted, father Lamormain! Eight thousand horse! Yes, yes! 'Tis as it should be! I see it coming! Questenberg. There is nothing coming. All stands in front: the counsel of state-prudence, The dictate of necessity!— Wallenstein. What then? What, my Lord Envoy? May I not be suffered To understand, that folks are tired of seeing The sword's hilt in my grasp: and that your court Snatch eagerly at this pretence, and use The Spanish title, to drain off my forces, To lead into the empire a new army Unsubjected to my control. To throw me Plumply aside,—I am still too powerful for you To venture that. My stipulation runs, That all the Imperial forces shall obey me Where'er the German is the native language. Of Spanish troops and of Prince Cardinals That take their route, as visitors, through the empire, There stands no syllable in my stipulation. No syllable! And so the politic court Steals in a-tiptoe, and creeps round behind it; First makes me weaker, then to be dispensed with, Till it dares strike at length a bolder blow And make short work with me. What need of all these crooked ways, Lord Envoy? Straight-forward man! His compact with me pinches The Emperor. He would that I moved off!— Well!—I will gratify him! [Here there commences an agitation among the Generals which increases continually. It grieves me for my noble officers' sakes! I see not yet, by what means they will come at The moneys they have advanced, or how obtain The recompense their services demand. Still a new leader brings new claimants forward, And prior merit superannuates quickly. There serve here many foreigners in the army, And were the man in all else brave and gallant, I was not wont to make nice scrutiny After his pedigree or catechism. This will be otherwise, i'the time to come. Well—me no longer it concerns. [He seats himself. Max Piccolomini. Forbid it, Heaven, that it should come to this! Our troops will swell in dreadful fermentation— The Emperor is abused—it cannot be. Isolani. It cannot be; all goes to instant wreck. Wallenstein. Thou hast said truly, faithful Isolani! What we with toil and foresight have built up, Will go to wreck—all go to instant wreck. What then? another chieftain is soon found, Another army likewise (who dares doubt it?) Will flock from all sides to the Emperor At the first beat of his recruiting drum. [During this speech, Isolani, Tertsky, Illo and Maradas talk confusedly with great agitation. Max Piccolomini (busily and passionately going from one to another, and soothing them). Hear, my commander! Hear me, generals! Let me conjure you, Duke! Determine nothing, Till we have met and represented to you Our joint remonstrances.—Nay, calmer! Friends! I hope all may be yet set right again. Tertsky. Away! let us away! in the antechamber Find we the others. [They go. Butler (to Questenberg). If good counsel gain Due audience from your wisdom, my Lord Envoy! You will be cautious how you shew yourself In public for some hours to come—or hardly Will that gold key protect you from maltreatment. [Commotions heard from without. Wallenstein. A salutary counsel—Thou, Octavio! Wilt answer for the safety of our guest. Farewell, Von Questenberg! [Questenberg is about to speak. Nay, not a word. Not one word more of that detested subject! You have performed your duty—We know how To separate the office from the man. [As Questenberg is going off with Octavio, Goetz, Tiefenbach, Kolatto, press in; several other Generals following them. Goetz. Where's he who means to rob us of our general? Tiefenbach (at the same time). What are we forced to hear? That thou wilt leave us? Kolatto (at the same time). We will live with thee, we will die with thee. Wallenstein (pointing to Illo). There! the Field-Marshal knows our will. [Exit. ACT II Scene I Scene—A small Chamber. Illo and Tertsky. Tertsky. Now for this evening's business! How intend you To manage with the generals at the banquet? Illo. Attend! We frame a formal declaration, Wherein we to the Duke consign ourselves Collectively, to be and to remain His both with life and limb, and not to spare The last drop of our blood for him, provided So doing we infringe no oath nor duty, We may be under to the Emperor.—Mark! This reservation we expressly make In a particular clause, and save the conscience. Now hear! This formula so framed and worded Will be presented to them for perusal Before the banquet. No one will find in it Cause of offence or scruple. Hear now further! After the feast, when now the vap'ring wine Opens the heart, and shuts the eyes, we let A counterfeited paper, in the which This one particular clause has been left out, Go round for signatures. Tertsky. How? think you then That they'll believe themselves bound by an oath, Which we had tricked them into by a juggle? Illo. We shall have caught and caged them! Let them then Beat their wings bare against the wires, and rave Loud as they may against our treachery, At court their signatures will be believed Far more than their most holy affirmations. Traitors they are, and must be; therefore wisely Will make a virtue of necessity. Tertsky. Well, well, it shall content me; let but something Be done, let only some decisive blow Set us in motion. Illo. Besides, 'tis of subordinate importance How, or how far, we may thereby propel The generals. 'Tis enough that we persuade The Duke, that they are his—Let him but act In his determined mood, as if he had them, And he will have them. Where he plunges in, He makes a whirlpool, and all stream down to it. Tertsky. His policy is such a labyrinth, That many a time when I have thought myself Close at his side, he's gone at once, and left me Ignorant of the ground where I was standing. He lends the enemy his ear, permits me To write to them, to Arnheim; to Sesina Himself comes forward blank and undisguised; Talks with us by the hour about his plans, And when I think I have him—off at once— He has slipped from me, and appears as if He had no scheme, but to retain his place. Illo. He give up his old plans! I'll tell you, friend! His soul is occupied with nothing else, Even in his sleep—They are his thoughts, his dreams, That day by day he questions for this purpose The motions of the planets— Tertsky. Ay! you know This night, that is now coming, he with Seni Shuts himself up in the astrological tower To make joint observations—for I hear, It is to be a night of weight and crisis; And something great, and of long expectation, Is to make its procession in the heaven. Illo. Come! be we bold and make dispatch. The work In this next day or two must thrive and grow More than it has for years. And let but only Things first turn up auspicious here below— Mark what I say—the right stars too will shew themselves. Come, to the generals. All is in the glow, And must be beaten while 'tis malleable. Tertsky. Do you go thither, Illo. I must stay And wait here for the Countess Tertsky. Know That we too are not idle. Break one string, A second is in readiness. Illo. Yes! Yes! I saw your Lady smile with such sly meaning. What's in the wind? Tertsky. A secret. Hush! she comes. [Exit Illo. Scene II The Countess steps out from a Closet. Count and Countess Tertsky. Tertsky. Well—is she coming?—I can keep him back No longer. Countess. She will be there instantly. You only send him. Tertsky. I am not quite certain, I must confess it, Countess, whether or not We are earning the Duke's thanks hereby. You know, No ray has broken from him on this point. You have o'er-ruled me, and yourself know best How far you dare proceed. Countess. I take it on me. [Talking to herself, while she is advancing. Here's no need of full powers and commissions— My cloudy Duke! we understand each other— And without words. What, could I not unriddle, Wherefore the daughter should be sent for hither, Why first he, and no other, should be chosen To fetch her hither! This sham of betrothing her To a bridegroom, whom no one knows—No! no!— This may blind others! I see through thee, Brother! But it beseems thee not, to draw a card At such a game. Not yet!—It all remains Mutely delivered up to my finessing— Well—thou shalt not have been deceived, Duke Friedland! In her who is thy sister.— Servant (enters). The commanders! Tertsky (to the Countess). Take care you heat his fancy and affections— Possess him with a reverie, and send him, Absent and dreaming, to the banquet; that He may not boggle at the signature. Countess. Take you care of your guests!—Go, send him hither. Tertsky. All rests upon his undersigning. Countess. Go to your guests! Go— Illo (comes back). Where art staying, Tertsky? The house is full, and all expecting you. Tertsky. Instantly! Instantly! [To the Countess. And let him not Stay here too long. It might awake suspicion In the old man— Countess. A truce with your precautions! [Exeunt Tertsky and Illo. Scene III Countess, Max Piccolomini. Max. Aunt Tertsky? may I venture? [Advances to the middle of the stage, and looks around him with uneasiness. She's not here! Where is she? Countess. Look but somewhat narrowly In yonder corner, lest perhaps she lie Conceal'd behind that screen. Max. There lie her gloves! [Snatches at them, but the Countess takes them herself. You unkind Lady! You refuse me this— You make it an amusement to torment me. Countess. And this the thanks you give me for my trouble? Max. O, if you felt the oppression at my heart! Since we've been here, so to constrain myself— With such poor stealth to hazard words and glances— These, these are not my habits! Countess. You have still Many new habits to acquire, young friend! But on this proof of your obedient temper I must continue to insist; and only On this condition can I play the agent For your concerns. Max. But wherefore comes she not? Where is she? Countess. Into my hands you must place it Whole and entire. Whom could you find, indeed, More zealously affected to your interest? No soul on earth must know it—not your father. He must not above all. Max. Alas! what danger? Here is no face on which I might concentre All the enraptured soul stirs up within me. O Lady! tell me. Is all changed around me? Or is it only I? I find myself, As among strangers! Not a trace is left Of all my former wishes, former joys. Where has it vanished to? There was a time When even, methought, with such a world as this I was not discontented. Now how flat! How stale! No life, no bloom, no flavour in it! My comrades are intolerable to me. My father—Even to him I can say nothing. My arms, my military duties—O! They are such wearying toys! Countess. But, gentle friend! I must entreat it of your condescension, You would be pleased to sink your eye, and favour With one short glance or two this poor stale world, Where even now much, and of much moment, Is on the eve of its completion. Max. Something, I can't but know, is going forward round me. I see it gathering, crowding, driving on, In wild uncustomary movements. Well, In due time, doubtless, it will reach even me. Where think you I have been, dear lady? Nay, No raillery. The turmoil of the camp, The spring-tide of acquaintance rolling in, The pointless jest, the empty conversation, Oppress'd and stifled me. I gasped for air— I could not breathe—I was constrain'd to fly, To seek a silence out for my full heart; And a pure spot wherein to feel my happiness. No smiling, Countess! In the church was I. There is a cloister here to the heaven's gate, Thither I went, there found myself alone. Over the altar hung a holy mother; A wretched painting 'twas, yet 'twas the friend That I was seeking in this moment. Ah, How oft have I beheld that glorious form In splendour, mid ecstatic worshippers; Yet, still it moved me not! and now at once Was my devotion cloudless as my love. Countess. Enjoy your fortune and felicity! Forget the world around you. Meantime, friendship Shall keep strict vigils for you, anxious, active. Only be manageable when that friendship Points you the road to full accomplishment. How long may it be since you declared your passion? Max. This morning did I hazard the first word. Countess. This morning the first time in twenty days? Max. 'Twas at that hunting-castle, betwixt here And Nepomuck, where you had joined us, and— That was the last relay of the whole journey! In a balcony we were standing mute, And gazing out upon the dreary field: Before us the dragoons were riding onward, The safe-guard which the Duke had sent us—heavy The inquietude of parting lay upon me, And trembling ventured I at length these words: This all reminds me, noble maiden, that To-day I must take leave of my good fortune. A few hours more, and you will find a father, Will see yourself surrounded by new friends, And I henceforth shall be but as a stranger, Lost in the many—‘Speak with my aunt Tertsky!’ With hurrying voice she interrupted me. She faltered. I beheld a glowing red Possess her beautiful cheeks, and from the ground Raised slowly up her eye met mine—no longer Did I control myself. [The Princess Thekla appears at the door, and remains standing, observed by the Countess, but not by Piccolomini. With instant boldness I caught her in my arms, my mouth touched hers; There was a rustling in the room close by; It parted us—'Twas you. What since has happened, You know. Countess. And is it your excess of modesty; Or are you so incurious, that you do not Ask me too of my secret? Max. Of your secret? Countess. Why, yes! When in the instant after you I stepped into the room, and found my niece there, What she in this first moment of the heart Ta'en with surprise— Max. Well? Scene IV Thekla (hurries forward), Countess, Max Piccolomini. Thekla (to the Countess). Spare yourself the trouble: That hears he better from myself. Max. My Princess! What have you let her hear me say, aunt Tertsky? Thekla (to the Countess). Has he been here long? Countess. Yes; and soon must go. Where have you stayed so long? Thekla. Alas! my mother Wept so again! and I—I see her suffer, Yet cannot keep myself from being happy. Max. Now once again I have courage to look on you. To-day at noon I could not. The dazzle of the jewels that play'd round you Hid the beloved from me. Thekla. Then you saw me With your eye only—and not with your heart? Max. This morning, when I found you in the circle Of all your kindred, in your father's arms, Beheld myself an alien in this circle, O! what an impulse felt I in that moment To fall upon his neck, to call him father! But his stern eye o'erpowered the swelling passion— It dared not but be silent. And those brilliants, That like a crown of stars enwreathed your brows, They scared me too! O wherefore, wherefore should he At the first meeting spread as 'twere the ban Of excommunication round you, wherefore Dress up the angel as for sacrifice, And cast upon the light and joyous heart The mournful burthen of his station? Fitly May love dare woo for love; but such a splendour Might none but monarchs venture to approach. Thekla. Hush! not a word more of this mummery. You see how soon the burthen is thrown off. [To the Countess. He is not in spirits. Wherefore is he not? 'Tis you, aunt, that have made him all so gloomy! He had quite another nature on the journey— So calm, so bright, so joyous eloquent. [To Max. It was my wish to see you always so, And never otherwise! Max. You find yourself In your great father's arms, belovéd lady! All in a new world, which does homage to you, And which, wer't only by its novelty, Delights your eye. Thekla. Yes; I confess to you That many things delight me here: this camp, This motley stage of warriors, which renews So manifold the image of my fancy, And binds to life, binds to reality, What hitherto had but been present to me As a sweet dream! Max. Alas! not so to me. It makes a dream of my reality. Upon some island in the ethereal heights I've lived for these last days. This mass of men Forces me down to earth. It is a bridge That, reconducting to my former life, Divides me and my heaven. Thekla. The game of life Looks cheerful, when one carries in one's heart The inalienable treasure. 'Tis a game, Which having once reviewed, I turn more joyous Back to my deeper and appropriate bliss. In this short time that I've been present here, What new unheard-of things have I not seen! And yet they all must give place to the wonder Which this mysterious castle guards. Countess. And what Can this be then? Methought I was acquainted With all the dusky corners of this house. Thekla. Ay, but the road thereto is watched by spirits, Two griffins still stand sentry at the door. Countess (laughs). The astrological tower!—How happens it That this same sanctuary, whose access Is to all others so impracticable, Opens before you even at your approach? Thekla. A dwarfish old man with a friendly face And snow-white hairs, whose gracious services Were mine at first sight, opened me the doors. Max. That is the Duke's astrologer, old Seni. Thekla. He questioned me on many points; for instance, When I was born, what month, and on what day, Whether by day or in the night. Countess. He wished To erect a figure for your horoscope. Thekla. My hand too he examined, shook his head With much sad meaning, and the lines methought, Did not square over truly with his wishes. Countess. Well, Princess, and what found you in this tower? My highest privilege has been to snatch A side-glance, and away! Thekla. It was a strange Sensation that came o'er me, when at first From the broad sunshine I stepped in; and now The narrowing line of day-light, that ran after The closing door, was gone; and all about me 'Twas pale and dusky night, with many shadows Fantastically cast. Here six or seven Colossal statues, and all kings, stood round me In a half-circle. Each one in his hand A sceptre bore, and on his head a star; And in the tower no other light was there But from these stars: all seemed to come from them. ‘These are the planets,’ said that low old man, ‘They govern worldly fates, and for that cause Are imaged here as kings. He farthest from you, Spiteful, and cold, an old man melancholy, With bent and yellow forehead, he is Saturn. He opposite, the king with the red light, An arm'd man for the battle, that is Mars: And both these bring but little luck to man.’ But at his side a lovely lady stood, The star upon her head was soft and bright, And that was Venus, the bright star of joy. On the left hand, lo! Mercury, with wings. Quite in the middle glittered silver-bright A cheerful man, and with a monarch's mien; And this was Jupiter, my father's star: And at his side I saw the Sun and Moon. Max. O never rudely will I blame his faith In the might of stars and angels! 'Tis not merely The human being's Pride that peoples space With life and mystical predominance; Since likewise for the stricken heart of Love This visible nature, and this common world, Is all too narrow: yea, a deeper import Lurks in the legend told my infant years Than lies upon that truth, we live to learn. For fable is Love's world, his home, his birth-place; Delightedly dwells he 'mong fays and talismans, And spirits; and delightedly believes Divinities, being himself divine. The intelligible forms of ancient poets, The fair humanities of old religion, The Power, the Beauty, and the Majesty, That had their haunts in dale, or piny mountain, Or forest by slow stream, or pebbly spring, Or chasms and wat'ry depths; all these have vanished. They live no longer in the faith of reason! But still the heart doth need a language, still Doth the old instinct bring back the old names, And to yon starry world they now are gone, Spirits or gods, that used to share this earth With man as with their friend; and to the lover Yonder they move, from yonder visible sky Shoot influence down: and even at this day 'Tis Jupiter who brings whate'er is great, And Venus who brings every thing that's fair! Thekla. And if this be the science of the stars, I too, with glad and zealous industry, Will learn acquaintance with this cheerful faith. It is a gentle and affectionate thought, That in immeasurable heights above us, At our first birth, the wreath of love was woven, With sparkling stars for flowers. Countess. Not only roses, But thorns too hath the heaven; and well for you Leave they your wreath of love inviolate; What Venus twined, the bearer of glad fortune, The sullen orb of Mars soon tears to pieces. Max. Soon will his gloomy empire reach its close. Blest be the General's zeal: into the laurel Will he inweave the olive-branch, presenting Peace to the shouting nations. Then no wish Will have remained for his great heart! Enough Has he performed for glory, and can now Live for himself and his. To his domains Will he retire; he has a stately seat Of fairest view at Gitschin; Reichenberg, And Friedland Castle, both lie pleasantly— Even to the foot of the huge mountains here Stretches the chase and covers of his forests: His ruling passion, to create the splendid, He can indulge without restraint; can give A princely patronage to every art, And to all worth a Sovereign's protection. Can build, can plant, can watch the starry courses— Countess. Yet I would have you look, and look again, Before you lay aside your arms, young friend! A gentle bride, as she is, is well worth it, That you should woo and win her with the sword. Max. O, that the sword could win her! Countess. What was that? Did you hear nothing? Seem'd, as if I heard Tumult and larum in the banquet-room. [Exit Countess. Scene V Thekla and Max Piccolomini. Thekla (as soon as the Countess is out of sight, in a quick low voice to Piccolomini). Don't trust them! They are false! Max. Impossible! Thekla. Trust no one here but me. I saw at once, They had a purpose. Max. Purpose! but what purpose? And how can we be instrumental to it? Thekla. I know no more than you; but yet believe me: There's some design in this! to make us happy, To realize our union—trust me, love! They but pretend to wish it. Max. But these Tertskys— Why use we them at all? Why not your mother? Excellent creature! she deserves from us A full and filial confidence. Thekla. She doth love you, Doth rate you high before all others—but— But such a secret—she would never have The courage to conceal it from my father. For her own peace of mind we must preserve it A secret from her too. Max. Why any secret? I love not secrets. Mark, what I will do. I'll throw me at your father's feet—let him Decide upon my fortunes!—He is true, He wears no mask—he hates all crooked ways— He is so good, so noble! Thekla (falls on his neck). That are you! Max. You knew him only since this morn; but I Have liv'd ten years already in his presence, And who knows whether in this very moment He is not merely waiting for us both To own our loves, in order to unite us. You are silent!— You look at me with such a hopelessness! What have you to object against your father? Thekla. I? Nothing. Only he's so occupied— He has no leisure time to think about The happiness of us two. [Taking his hand tenderly. Follow me! Let us not place too great a faith in men. These Tertskys—we will still be grateful to them For every kindness, but not trust them further Than they deserve;—and in all else rely— On our own hearts! Max. O! shall we e'er be happy? Thekla. Are we not happy now? Art thou not mine? Am I not thine? There lives within my soul A lofty courage—'tis love gives it me! I ought to be less open—ought to hide My heart more from thee—so decorum dictates: But where in this place could'st thou seek for truth, If in my mouth thou did'st not find it? Scene VI To them enters the Countess Tertsky. Countess. Come! My husband sends me for you—It is now The latest moment. Part you! Thekla. O, not yet! It has been scarce a moment. Countess. Aye! Then time Flies swiftly with your Highness, Princess niece! Max. There is no hurry, aunt. Countess. Away! Away! The folks begin to miss you. Twice already His father has asked for him. Thekla. Ha! his father? Countess. You understand that, niece! Thekla. Why needs he To go at all to that society? 'Tis not his proper company. They may Be worthy men, but he's too young for them. In brief, he suits not such society. Countess. You mean, you'd rather keep him wholly here? Thekla. Yes! you have hit it, aunt! That is my meaning. Leave him here wholly! Tell the company— Countess. What? have you lost your senses, niece?— Count, you remember the conditions. Come! Max (to Thekla). Lady, I must obey. Farewell, dear lady! [Thekla turns away from him with a quick motion. What say you then, dear lady? Thekla (without looking at him). Nothing. Go! Max. Can I, when you are angry— [He draws up to her, their eyes meet, she stands silent a moment, then throws herself into his arms; he presses her fast to his heart. Countess. Off! Heavens! if any one should come! Hark! What's that noise? It comes this way.—Off! [Max tears himself away out of her arms, and goes. The Countess accompanies him. Thekla follows him with her eyes at first, walks restlessly across the room, then stops, and remains standing, lost in thought. A guitar lies on the table, she seizes it as by a sudden emotion, and after she has played a while an irregular and melancholy symphony, she falls gradually into the music and sings. Thekla (plays and sings). The cloud doth gather, the greenwood roar, The damsel paces along the shore; The billows they tumble with might, with might; And she flings out her voice to the darksome night; Her bosom is swelling with sorrow; The world it is empty, the heart will die, There's nothing to wish for beneath the sky: Thou Holy One, call thy child away! I've lived and loved, and that was to-day— Make ready my grave-clothes to-morrow. Scene VII Countess (returns), Thekla. Countess. Fie, lady niece! to throw yourself upon him, Like a poor gift to one who cares not for it, And so must be flung after him! For you, Duke Friedland's only child, I should have thought It had been more beseeming to have shewn yourself More chary of your person. Thekla. And what mean you? Countess. I mean, niece, that you should not have forgotten Who you are, and who he is. But perchance That never once occurred to you. Thekla. What then? Countess. That you're the daughter of the Prince-Duke Friedland. Thekla. Well—and what farther? Countess. What? a pretty question! Thekla. He was born that which we have but become. He's of an ancient Lombard family, Son of a reigning princess. Countess. Are you dreaming? Talking in sleep? An excellent jest, forsooth! We shall no doubt right courteously entreat him To honour with his hand the richest heiress In Europe. Thekla. That will not be necessary. Countess. Methinks 'twere well though not to run the hazard. Thekla. His father loves him, Count Octavio Will interpose no difficulty— Countess. His! His father! his! But yours, niece, what of yours? Thekla. Why I begin to think you fear his father, So anxiously you hide it from the man! His father, his, I mean. Countess (looks at her). Niece, you are false. Thekla. Are you then wounded? O, be friends with me! Countess. You hold your game for won already. Do not Triumph too soon!— Thekla. Nay now, be friends with me. Countess. It is not yet so far gone. Thekla. I believe you. Countess. Did you suppose your father had laid out His most important life in toils of war, Denied himself each quiet earthly bliss, Had banished slumber from his tent, devoted His noble head to care, and for this only, To make a happy pair of you? At length To draw you from your convent, and conduct In easy triumph to your arms the man That chanc'd to please your eyes! All this, methinks, He might have purchased at a cheaper rate. Thekla. That which he did not plant for me might yet Bear me fair fruitage of its own accord. And if my friendly and affectionate fate, Out of his fearful and enormous being, Will but prepare the joys of life for me— Countess. Thou seest it with a love-lorn maiden's eyes. Cast thine eye round, bethink thee who thou art. Into no house of joyance hast thou stepped, For no espousals dost thou find the walls Deck'd out, no guests the nuptial garland wearing. Here is no splendour but of arms. Or think'st thou That all these thousands are here congregated To lead up the long dances at thy wedding? Thou see'st thy father's forehead full of thought, Thy mother's eye in tears: upon the balance Lies the great destiny of all our house. Leave now the puny wish, the girlish feeling, O thrust it far behind thee! Give thou proof, Thou'rt the daughter of the Mighty—his Who where he moves creates the wonderful. Not to herself the woman must belong, Annexed and bound to alien destinies. But she performs the best part, she the wisest, Who can transmute the alien into self, Meet and disarm necessity by choice; And what must be, take freely to her heart, And bear and foster it with mother's love. Thekla. Such ever was my lesson in the convent. I had no loves, no wishes, knew myself Only as his—his daughter—his, the Mighty! His fame, the echo of whose blast drove to me From the far distance, wakened in my soul No other thought than this—I am appointed To offer up myself in passiveness to him. Countess. That is thy fate. Mould thou thy wishes to it. I and thy mother gave thee the example. Thekla. My fate hath shewn me him, to whom behoves it That I should offer up myself. In gladness Him will I follow. Countess. Not thy fate hath shewn him! Thy heart, say rather—'twas thy heart, my child! Thekla. Fate hath no voice but the heart's impulses. I am all his! His Present—his alone, Is this new life, which lives in me. He hath A right to his own creature. What was I Ere his fair love infused a soul into me? Countess. Thou would'st oppose thy father then, should he Have otherwise determined with thy person? [Thekla remains silent. The Countess continues. Thou mean'st to force him to thy liking?—Child, His name is Friedland. Thekla. My name too is Friedland. He shall have found a genuine daughter in me. Countess. What? he has vanquished all impediment, And in the wilful mood of his own daughter Shall a new struggle rise for him? Child! child! As yet thou hast seen thy father's smiles alone; The eye of his rage thou hast not seen. Dear child, I will not frighten thee. To that extreme, I trust, it ne'er shall come. His will is yet Unknown to me: 'tis possible his aims May have the same direction as thy wish. But this can never, never be his will, That thou, the daughter of his haughty fortunes, Should'st e'er demean thee as a love-sick maiden; And like some poor cost-nothing, fling thyself Toward the man, who, if that high prize ever Be destined to await him, yet, with sacrifices The highest love can bring, must pay for it. [Exit Countess. Thekla. I thank thee for the hint. It turns My sad presentiment to certainty. And it is so!—Not one friend have we here, Not one true heart! we've nothing but ourselves! O she said rightly—no auspicious signs Beam on this covenant of our affections. This is no theatre, where hope abides. The dull thick noise of war alone stirs here. And love himself, as he were armed in steel, Steps forth, and girds him for the strife of death. [Music from the banquet-room is heard. There's a dark spirit walking in our house, And swiftly will the Destiny close on us. It drove me hither from my calm asylum, It mocks my soul with charming witchery, It lures me forward in a seraph's shape, I see it near, I see it nearer floating, It draws, it pulls me with a god-like power— And lo! the abyss—and thither am I moving— I have no power within me not to move! [The music from the banquet-room becomes louder. O when a house is doomed in fire to perish, Many a dark heaven drives his clouds together, Yea, shoots his lightnings down from sunny heights, Flames burst from out the subterraneous chasms, And fiends and angels mingling in their fury, Sling fire-brands at the burning edifice. [Exit Thekla. Scene VIII A large Saloon lighted up with festal Splendour; in the midst of it, and in the Centre of the Stage, a Table richly set out, at which eight Generals are sitting, among whom are Octavio Piccolomini, Tertsky, and Maradas. Right and left of this, but farther back, two other Tables, at each of which six Persons are placed. The Middle Door, which is standing open, gives to the Prospect a Fourth Table, with the same Number of Persons. More forward stands the sideboard. The whole front of the Stage is kept open for the Pages and Servants in waiting. All is in Motion. The Band of Music belonging to Tertsky's Regiment march across the Stage, and draw up round the Tables. Before they are quite off from the Front of the Stage, Max Piccolomini appears, Tertsky advances towards him with a Paper, Isolani comes up to meet him with a Beaker or Service-cup. Tertsky, Isolani, Max Piccolomini. Isolani. Here brother, what we love! Why, where hast been? Off to thy place—quick! Tertsky here has given The mother's holiday wine up to free booty. Here it goes on as at the Heidelberg castle. Already hast thou lost the best. They're giving At yonder table ducal crowns in shares; There's Sternberg's lands and chattels are put up, With Egenberg's, Stawata's, Lichtenstein's, And all the great Bohemian feodalities. Be nimble, lad! and something may turn up For thee—who knows? off—to thy place! quick! march! Tiefenbach and Goetz (call out from the second and third tables). Count Piccolomini! Tertsky. Stop, ye shall have him in an instant.—Read This oath here, whether as 'tis here set forth, The wording satisfies you. They've all read it, Each in his turn, and each one will subscribe His individual signature. Max (reads). ‘Ingratis servire nefas.’ Isolani. That sounds to my ears very much like Latin, And being interpreted, pray what may't mean? Tertsky. No honest man will serve a thankless master. Max. ‘Inasmuch as our supreme Commander, the illustrious Duke of Friedland, in consequence of the manifold affronts and grievances which he has received, had expressed his determination to quit the Emperor, but on our unanimous entreaty has graciously consented to remain still with the army, and not to part from us without our approbation thereof, so we, collectively and each in particular, in the stead of an oath personally taken, do hereby oblige ourselves—likewise by him honourably and faithfully to hold, and in nowise whatsoever from him to part, and to be ready to shed for his interests the last drop of our blood, so far, namely, as our oath to the Emperor will permit it. (These last words are repeated by Isolani.) In testimony of which we subscribe our names.’ Tertsky. Now!—are you willing to subscribe this paper? Isolani. Why should he not? All officers of honour Can do it, aye, must do it.—Pen and ink here! Tertsky. Nay, let it rest till after meal. Isolani (drawing Max along). Come, Max. [Both seat themselves at their table. Scene IX Tertsky, Neumann. Tertsky (beckons to Neumann who is waiting at the side-table, and steps forward with him to the edge of the stage). Have you the copy with you, Neumann? Give it. It may be changed for the other? Neumann. I have copied it. Letter by letter, line by line; no eye Would e'er discover other difference, Save only the omission of that clause, According to your Excellency's order. Tertsky. Right! lay it yonder, and away with this— It has performed its business—to the fire with it— Neumann lays the copy on the table and steps back again to the side-table. Scene X Illo (comes out from the second chamber), Tertsky. Illo. How goes it with young Piccolomini? Tertsky. All right, I think. He has started no objection. Illo. He is the only one I fear about— He and his father. Have an eye on both! Tertsky. How looks it at your table: you forget not To keep them warm and stirring? Illo. O, quite cordial, They are quite cordial in the scheme. We have them. And 'tis as I predicted too. Already It is the talk, not merely to maintain The Duke in station. ‘Since we're once for all Together and unanimous, why not,’ Says Montecuculi, ‘aye, why not onward, And make conditions with the Emperor There in his own Vienna?’ Trust me, Count, Were it not for these said Piccolomini, We might have spared ourselves the cheat. Tertsky. And Butler? How goes it there? Hush! Scene XI To them enter Butler from the second table. Butler. Don't disturb yourselves. Field Marshal, I have understood you perfectly. Good luck be to the scheme; and as to me, You may depend upon me. Illo. May we, Butler? Butler. With or without the clause, all one to me! You understand me? My fidelity The Duke may put to any proof—I'm with him! Tell him so! I'm the Emperor's officer, As long as 'tis his pleasure to remain The Emperor's general! and Friedland's servant, As soon as it shall please him to become His own lord. Tertsky. You would make a good exchange. No stern economist, no Ferdinand, Is he to whom you plight your services. Butler. I do not put up my fidelity To sale, Count Tertsky! Half a year ago I would not have advised you to have made me An overture to that, to which I now Offer myself of my own free accord.— But that is past! and to the Duke, Field Marshal, I bring myself together with my regiment. And mark you, 'tis my humour to believe, The example which I give will not remain Without an influence. Illo. Who is ignorant, That the whole army look to Colonel Butler, As to a light that moves before them? Butler. Ey? Then I repent me not of that fidelity Which for the length of forty years I held, If in my sixtieth year my old good name Can purchase for me a revenge so full. Start not at what I say, sir Generals! My real motives—they concern not you. And you yourselves, I trust, could not expect That this your game had crooked my judgment—or That fickleness, quick blood, or such light cause, Had driven the old man from the track of honour, Which he so long had trodden.—Come, my friends! I'm not thereto determined with less firmness, Because I know and have looked steadily At that on which I have determined. Illo. Say, And speak roundly, what are we to deem you? Butler. A friend! I give you here my hand! I'm yours With all I have. Not only men, but money Will the Duke want.—Go, tell him, sirs! I've earned and laid up somewhat in his service, I lend it him; and is he my survivor, It has been already long ago bequeathed him. He is my heir. For me, I stand alone, Here in the world; nought know I of the feeling That binds the husband to a wife and children. My name dies with me, my existence ends. Illo. 'Tis not your money that he needs—a heart Like yours weighs tons of gold down, weighs down millions! Butler. I came a simple soldier's boy from Ireland To Prague—and with a master, whom I buried. From lowest stable-duty I climbed up, Such was the fate of war, to this high rank, The plaything of a whimsical good fortune. And Wallenstein too is a child of luck, I love a fortune that is like my own. Illo. All powerful souls have kindred with each other. Butler. This is an awful moment! to the brave, To the determined, an auspicious moment. The Prince of Weimar arms, upon the Maine To found a mighty dukedom. He of Halberstadt, That Mansfeld, wanted but a longer life To have marked out with his good sword a lordship That should reward his courage. Who of these Equals our Friedland? there is nothing, nothing So high, but he may set the ladder to it! Tertsky. That's spoken like a man! Butler. Do you secure the Spaniard and Italian— I'll be your warrant for the Scotchman Lesly. Come! to the company! Tertsky. Where is the master of the cellar? Ho! Let the best wines come up. Ho! cheerly, boy! Luck comes to-day, so give her hearty welcome. [Exeunt, each to his table. Scene XII The Master of the Cellar advancing with Neumann, Servants passing backwards and forwards. Master of the Cellar. The best wine! O! if my old mistress, his lady mother, could but see these wild goings on, she would turn herself round in her grave. Yes, yes, sir officer! 'tis all down the hill with this noble house! no end, no moderation! And this marriage with the Duke's sister, a splendid connection, a very splendid connection! but I tell you, sir officer, it bodes no good. Neumann. Heaven forbid! Why, at this very moment the whole prospect is in bud and blossom! Master of the Cellar. You think so?—Well, well! much may be said on that head. First Servant (comes). Burgundy for the fourth table. Master of the Cellar. Now, sir lieutenant, if this isn't the seventieth flask— First Servant. Why, the reason is, that German lord, Tiefenbach, sits at that table. Master of the Cellar (continuing his discourse to Neumann). They are soaring too high. They would rival kings and electors in their pomp and splendour; and wherever the Duke leaps, not a minute does my gracious master, the Count, loiter on the brink—(To the Servants)—What do you stand there listening for? I will let you know you have legs presently. Off! see to the tables, see to the flasks! Look there! Count Palfi has an empty glass before him! Runner (comes). The great service-cup is wanted, sir; that rich gold cup with the Bohemian arms on it. The Count says you know which it is. Master of the Cellar. Ay! that was made for Frederick's coronation by the artist William—there was not such another prize in the whole booty at Prague. Runner. The same!—a health is to go round in him. Master of the Cellar. This will be something for the talebearers —this goes to Vienna. Neumann. Permit me to look at it.—Well, this is a cup indeed! How heavy! as well it may be, being all gold.— And what neat things are embossed on it! how natural and elegant they look! There, on that first quarter, let me see. That proud Amazon there on horseback, she that is taking a leap over the crosier and mitres, and carries on a wand a hat together with a banner, on which there's a goblet represented. Can you tell me what all this signifies? Master of the Cellar. The woman whom you see there on horseback, is the Free Election of the Bohemian Crown. That is signified by the round hat, and by that fiery steed on which she is riding. The hat is the pride of man; for he who cannot keep his hat on before kings and emperors is no free man. Neumann. But what is the cup there on the banner? Master of the Cellar. The cup signifies the freedom of the Bohemian Church, as it was in our forefathers' times. Our forefathers in the wars of the Hussites forced from the Pope this noble privilege: for the Pope, you know, will not grant the cup to any layman. Your true Moravian values nothing beyond the cup; it is his costly jewel, and has cost the Bohemians their precious blood in many and many a battle. Neumann. And what says that chart that hangs in the air there, over it all? Master of the Cellar. That signifies the Bohemian letter royal, which we forced from the Emperor Rudolph— a precious, never to be enough valued parchment that secures to the new Church the old privileges of free ringing and open psalmody. But since he of Steiermärk has ruled over us, that is at an end; and after the battle of Prague, in which Count Palatine Frederick lost crown and empire, our faith hangs upon the pulpit and the altar—and our brethren look at their homes over their shoulders; but the letter royal the Emperor himself cut to pieces with his scissors. Neumann. Why, my good Master of the Cellar! you are deep read in the chronicles of your country! Master of the Cellar. So were my forefathers, and for that reason were they minstrels, and served under Procopius and Ziska. Peace be with their ashes! Well, well! they fought for a good cause though—There! carry it up! Neumann. Stay! let me but look at this second quarter. Look there! That is, when at Prague Castle the Imperial Counsellors, Martinitz and Stawata were hurled down head over heels. 'Tis even so! there stands Count Thur who commands it. [Runner takes the service-cup and goes off with it. Master of the Cellar. O let me never more hear of that day. It was the three and twentieth of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand, six hundred, and eighteen. It seems to me as it were but yesterday—from that unlucky day it all began, all the heart-aches of the country. Since that day it is now sixteen years, and there has never once been peace on the earth. [Health drunk aloud at the second table. The Prince of Weimar! Hurra! [At the third and fourth table. Long live Prince William! Long live Duke Bernard! Hurra! [Music strikes up. First Servant. Hear'em! Hear'em! What an uproar! Second Servant (comes in running). Did you hear? They have drunk the Prince of Weimar's health. Third Servant. The Swedish Chief Commander! First Servant (speaking at the same time). The Lutheran! Second Servant. Just before, when Count Deodate gave out the Emperor's health, they were all as mum as a nibbling mouse. Master of the Cellar. Po, po! When the wine goes in, strange things come out. A good servant hears, and hears not!—You should be nothing but eyes and feet, except when you are called. Second Servant (to the Runner, to whom he gives secretly a flask of wine, keeping his eye on the Master of the Cellar, standing between him and the Runner). Quick, Thomas! before the Master of the Cellar runs this way—'tis a flask of Frontignac!—Snapped it up at the third table.—Canst go off with it? Runner (hides it in his pocket). All right! [Exit the Second Servant. Third Servant (aside to the First). Be on the hark, Jack! that we may have right plenty to tell to father Quivoga—He will give us right plenty of absolution in return for it. First Servant. For that very purpose I am always having something to do behind Illo's chair.—He is the man for speeches to make you stare with! Master of the Cellar (to Neumann). Who, pray, may that swarthy man be, he with the cross, that is chatting so confidentially with Esterhats? Neumann. Ay! he too is one of those to whom they confide too much. He calls himself Maradas, a Spaniard is he. Master of the Cellar (impatiently). Spaniard! Spaniard!—I tell you, friend; nothing good comes of those Spaniards. All these out-landish fellows are little better than rogues. Neumann. Fy, fy! you should not say so, friend. There are among them our very best generals, and those on whom the Duke at this moment relies the most. Master of the Cellar (taking the flask out of the Runner's pocket). My son, it will be broken to pieces in your pocket. [Tertsky hurries in, fetches away the paper, and calls to a Servant for pen and ink, and goes to the back of the stage. Master of the Cellar (to the Servants). The Lieutenant-General stands up.—Be on the watch.—Now! They break up.—Off, and move back the forms. [They rise at all the tables, the Servants hurry off the front of the stage to the tables; part of the guests come forward. Scene XIII Octavio Piccolomini enters in conversation with Maradas, and both place themselves quite on the edge of the stage on one side of the proscenium. On the side directly opposite, Max Piccolomini, by himself, lost in thought, and taking no part in any thing that is going forward. The middle space between both, but rather more distant from the edge of the stage, is filled up by Butler, Isolani, Goetz, Tiefenbach, and Kolatto. Isolani (while the company is coming forward). Good night, good night, Kolatto! Good night, Lieutenant-General!—I should rather say, good morning. Goetz (to Tiefenbach). Noble brother! Tiefenbach. Ay! 'twas a royal feast indeed. Goetz. Yes, my Lady Countess understands these matters. Her mother-in-law, heaven rest her soul, taught her!—Ah! that was a housewife for you! Tiefenbach. There was not her like in all Bohemia for setting out a table. Octavio (aside to Maradas). Do me the favour to talk to me— talk of what you will—or of nothing. Only preserve the appearance at least of talking. I would not wish to stand by myself, and yet I conjecture that there will be goings on here worthy of our attentive observation. Isolani (on the point of going). Lights! lights! Tertsky (advances with the paper to Isolani). Noble brother! two minutes longer!—Here is something to subscribe. Isolani. Subscribe as much as you like—but you must excuse me from reading it. Tertsky. There is no need. It is the oath which you have already read.—Only a few marks of your pen! [Isolani hands over the paper to Octavio respectfully. Tertsky. Nay, nay, first come first served. There is no precedence here. [Octavio runs over the paper with apparent indifference. Tertsky watches him at some distance. Goetz (to Tertsky). Noble Count! with your permission— Good night. Tertsky. Where's the hurry? Come, one other composing draught. (To the Servants)—Ho! Goetz. Excuse me—an't able. Tertsky. A thimble-full! Goetz. Excuse me. Tiefenbach (sits down). Pardon me, nobles!—This standing does not agree with me. Tertsky. Consult only your own convenience, General! Tiefenbach. Clear at head, sound in stomach—only my legs won't carry me any longer. Isolani. Poor legs! how should they? Such an unmerciful load! [Octavio subscribes his name, and reaches over the paper to Tertsky, who gives it to Isolani; and he goes to the table to sign his name. Tiefenbach. 'Twas that war in Pomerania that first brought it on. Out in all weathers—ice and snow—no help for it.—I shall never get the better of it all the days of my life. Goetz. Why, in simple verity, your Swede makes no nice enquiries about the season. Tertsky (observing Isolani, whose hand trembles excessively, so that he can scarce direct his pen). Have you had that ugly complaint long, noble brother?—Dispatch it. Isolani. The sins of youth! I have already tried the Chalybeate waters. Well—I must bear it. [Tertsky gives the paper to Maradas; he steps to the table to subscribe. Octavio (advancing to Butler). You are not over fond of the orgies of Bacchus, Colonel! I have observed it. You would, I think, find yourself more to your liking in the uproar of a battle, than of a feast. Butler. I must confess, 'tis not in my way. Octavio. Nor in mine either, I can assure you; and I am not a little glad, my much honoured Colonel Butler, that we agree so well in our opinions. A half dozen good friends at most, at a small round table, a glass of genuine Tokay, open hearts, and a rational conversation—that's my taste! Butler. And mine too, when it can be had. [The paper comes to Tiefenbach, who glances over it at the same time with Goetz and Kolatto. Maradas in the mean time returns to Octavio, all this takes place, the conversation with Butler proceeding uninterrupted. Octavio (introducing Maradas to Butler). Don Balthasar Maradas! likewise a man of our stamp, and long ago your admirer. [Butler bows. Octavio (continuing). You are a stranger here—'twas but yesterday you arrived—you are ignorant of the ways and means here. 'Tis a wretched place—I know, at our age, one loves to be snug and quiet—What if you moved your lodgings?—Come, be my visitor. (Butler makes a low bow.) Nay, without compliment! —For a friend like you, I have still a corner remaining. Butler. Your obliged humble servant, my Lord Lieutenant- General! [The paper comes to Butler, who goes to the table to subscribe it. The front of the stage is vacant, so that both the Piccolominis, each on the side where he had been from the commencement of the scene, remain alone. Octavio (after having some time watched his son in silence, advances somewhat nearer to him). You were long absent from us, friend! Max. I—urgent business detained me. Octavio. And, I observe, you are still absent! Max. You know this crowd and bustle always makes me silent. Octavio. May I be permitted to ask what business 'twas that detained you? Tertsky knows it without asking! Max. What does Tertsky know? Octavio. He was the only one who did not miss you. Isolani. Well done, father! Rout out his baggage! Beat up his quarters! there is something there that should not be. Tertsky (with the paper). Is there none wanting? Have the whole subscribed? Octavio. All. Tertsky (calling aloud). Ho! Who subscribes? Butler (to Tertsky). Count the names. There ought to be just thirty. Tertsky. Here is a cross. Tiefenbach. That's my mark. Isolani. He cannot write; but his cross is a good cross, and is honoured by Jews as well as Christians. Octavio (presses on to Max). Come, general! let us go. It is late. Tertsky. One Piccolomini only has signed. Isolani (pointing to Max). Look! that is your man, that statue there, who has had neither eye, ear, nor tongue for us the whole evening. [Max receives the paper from Tertsky, which he looks upon vacantly. Scene XIV To these enter Illo from the inner room. He has in his hand the golden service-cup, and is extremely distempered with drinking: Goetz and Butler follow him, endeavouring to keep him back. Illo. What do you want? Let me go. Goetz and Butler. Drink no more, Illo! For heaven's sake, drink no more. Illo (goes up to Octavio, and shakes him cordially by the hand, and then drinks). Octavio! I bring this to you! Let all grudge be drowned in this friendly bowl! I know well enough, ye never loved me—Devil take me!—and I never loved you!—I am always even with people in that way!—Let what's past be past —that is, you understand—forgotten! I esteem you infinitely. (Embracing him repeatedly.) You have not a dearer friend on earth than I—but that you know. The fellow that cries rogue to you calls me villain—and I'll strangle him!—my dear friend! Tertsky (whispering to him). Art in thy senses? For heaven's sake, Illo! think where you are! Illo (aloud). What do you mean?—There are none but friends here, are there? Not a sneaker among us, thank heaven! Tertsky (to Butler). Take him off with you, force him off, I entreat you, Butler! Butler (to Illo). Field Marshal! a word with you. [Leads him to the sideboard. Illo. A thousand for one! Fill—Fill it once more up to the brim.—To this gallant man's health! Isolani (to Max, who all the while has been staring on the paper with fixed but vacant eyes). Slow and sure, my noble brother!— Hast parsed it all yet?—Some words yet to go through?—Ha? Max. What am I to do? Tertsky (and at the same time Isolani). Sign your name. Max (returns the paper). Let it stay till to-morrow. It is business—to-day I am not sufficiently collected. Send it to me to-morrow. Tertsky. Nay, collect yourself a little. Isolani. Awake, man! awake!—Come, thy signature, and have done with it! What? Thou art the youngest in the whole company, and wouldest be wiser than all of us together? Look there! thy father has signed—we have all signed. Tertsky (to Octavio). Use your influence. Instruct him. Octavio. My son is at the age of discretion. Illo (leaves the service-cup on the sideboard). What's the dispute? Tertsky. He declines subscribing the paper. Max. I say, it may as well stay till to-morrow. Illo. It cannot stay. We have all subscribed to it—and so must you.—You must subscribe. Max. Illo, good night! Illo. No! You come not off so! The Duke shall learn who are his friends. [All collect round Illo and Max. Max. What my sentiments are towards the Duke, the Duke knows, every one knows—what need of this wild stuff? Illo. This is the thanks the Duke gets for his partiality to Italians and foreigners.—Us Bohemians he holds for little better than dullards—nothing pleases him but what's outlandish. Tertsky (to the commanders, who at Illo's words give a sudden start, as preparing to resent them). It is the wine that speaks, and not his reason. Attend not to him, I entreat you. Isolani. Wine invents nothing: it only tattles. Illo. He who is not with me is against me. Your tender consciences! Unless they can slip out by a back-door, by a puny proviso— Tertsky. He is stark mad—don't listen to him! Illo. —Unless they can slip out by a proviso.—What of the proviso? The devil take this proviso! Max. What is there here then of such perilous import? You make me curious—I must look closer at it. Tertsky (in a low voice to Illo). What are you doing, Illo? You are ruining us. Tiefenbach (to Kolatto). Ay, ay! I observed, that before we sat down to supper, it was read differently. Goetz. Why, I seemed to think so too. Isolani. What do I care for that? Where there stand other names, mine can stand too. Tiefenbach. Before supper there was a certain proviso therein, or short clause concerning our duties to the Emperor. Butler (to one of the commanders). For shame, for shame! Bethink you. What is the main business here? The question now is, whether we shall keep our General, or let him retire. One must not take these things too nicely and over-scrupulously. Isolani (to one of the Generals). Did the Duke make any of these provisos when he gave you your regiment? Tertsky (to Goetz). Or when he gave you the office of armypurveyancer, which brings you in yearly a thousand pistoles! Illo. He is a rascal who makes us out to be rogues. If there be any one that wants satisfaction, let him say so,—I am his man. Tiefenbach. Softly, softly! 'Twas but a word or two. Max (having read the paper gives it back). Till to-morrow, therefore! Illo (stammering with rage and fury, loses all command over himself, and presents the paper to Max with one hand, and his sword in the other). Subscribe—Judas! Isolani. Out upon you, Illo! Octavio, Tertsky, Butler (all together). Down with the sword! Max (rushes on him suddenly and disarms him, then to Count Tertsky). Take him off to bed. [Max leaves the stage. Illo cursing and raving is held back by some of the Officers, and amidst a universal confusion the curtain drops. ACT III Scene I Scene.—A Chamber in Piccolomini's Mansion.—Night. Octavio Piccolomini. A Valet de Chambre, with Lights. Octavio. —And when my son comes in, conduct him hither. What is the hour? Valet. 'Tis on the point of morning. Octavio. Set down the light. We mean not to undress. You may retire to sleep. [Exit Valet. Octavio paces, musing, across the chamber; Max Piccolomini enters unobserved, and looks at his father for some moments in silence. Max. Art thou offended with me? Heaven knows That odious business was no fault of mine. 'Tis true, indeed, I saw thy signature. What thou hadst sanctioned, should not, it might seem, Have come amiss to me. But—'tis my nature— Thou know'st that in such matters I must follow My own light, not another's. Octavio (embraces him). Follow it, O follow it still further, my best son! To-night, dear boy! it hath more faithfully Guided thee than the example of thy father. Max. Declare thyself less darkly. Octavio. I will do so. For after what has taken place this night, There must remain no secrets 'twixt us two. [Both seat themselves. Max Piccolomini! what thinkest thou of The oath that was sent round for signatures? Max. I hold it for a thing of harmless import, Although I love not these set declarations. Octavio. And on no other ground hast thou refused The signature they fain had wrested from thee? Max. It was a serious business—I was absent— The affair itself seemed not so urgent to me. Octavio. Be open, Max. Thou hadst then no suspicion? Max. Suspicion! what suspicion? Not the least. Octavio. Thank thy good angel, Piccolomini: He drew thee back unconscious from the abyss. Max. I know not what thou meanest. Octavio. I will tell thee. Fain would they have extorted from thee, son, The sanction of thy name to villainy; Yea, with a single flourish of thy pen, Made thee renounce thy duty and thy honour! Max (rises). Octavio! Octavio. Patience! Seat yourself. Much yet Hast thou to hear from me, friend!—hast for years Lived in incomprehensible illusion. Before thine eyes is Treason drawing out As black a web as e'er was spun for venom: A power of hell o'erclouds thy understanding. I dare no longer stand in silence—dare No longer see thee wandering on in darkness, Nor pluck the bandage from thine eyes. Max. My father! Yet, ere thou speak'st, a moment's pause of thought! If your disclosures should appear to be Conjectures only—and almost I fear They will be nothing further—spare them! I Am not in that collected mood at present, That I could listen to them quietly. Octavio. The deeper cause thou hast to hate this light, The more impatient cause have I, my son, To force it on thee. To the innocence And wisdom of thy heart I could have trusted thee With calm assurance—but I see the net Preparing—and it is thy heart itself Alarms me for thine innocence—that secret, Which thou concealest, forces mine from me. Know, then, they are duping thee!—a most foul game With thee and with us all—nay, hear me calmly— The Duke even now is playing. He assumes The mask, as if he would forsake the army; And in this moment makes he preparations That army from the Emperor to steal, And carry it over to the enemy! Max. That low Priest's legend I know well, but did not Expect to hear it from thy mouth. Octavio. That mouth, From which thou hearest it at this present moment, Doth warrant thee that it is no Priest's legend. Max. How mere a maniac they supposed the Duke! What, he can meditate?—the Duke?—can dream That he can lure away full thirty thousand Tried troops and true, all honourable soldiers, More than a thousand noblemen among them, From oaths, from duty, from their honour lure them, And make them all unanimous to do A deed that brands them scoundrels? Octavio. Such a deed, With such a front of infamy, the Duke No wise desires—what he requires of us Bears a far gentler appellation. Nothing He wishes, but to give the Empire peace. And so, because the Emperor hates this peace, Therefore the Duke—the Duke will force him to it. All parts of the Empire will he pacify, And for his trouble will retain in payment (What he has already in his gripe)—Bohemia! Max. Has he, Octavio, merited of us, That we—that we should think so vilely of him? Octavio. What we would think is not the question here. The affair speaks for itself—and clearest proofs! Hear me, my son—'tis not unknown to thee, In what ill credit with the Court we stand. But little dost thou know, or guess, what tricks, What base intrigues, what lying artifices, Have been employed—for this sole end—to sow Mutiny in the camp! All bands are loosed— Loosed all the bands, that link the officer To his liege Emperor, all that bind the soldier Affectionately to the citizen. Lawless he stands, and threateningly beleaguers The state he's bound to guard. To such a height 'Tis swoln, that at this hour the Emperor Before his armies—his own armies—trembles; Yea, in his capital, his palace, fears The traitor's poniards, and is meditating To hurry off and hide his tender offspring— Not from the Swedes, not from the Lutherans— No! from his own troops hide and hurry them! Max. Cease, cease! thou tortur'st, shatter'st me. I know That oft we tremble at an empty terror; But the false phantasm brings a real misery. Octavio. It is no phantasm. An intestine war, Of all the most unnatural and cruel, Will burst out into flames, if instantly We do not fly and stifle it. The Generals Are many of them long ago won over; The subalterns are vacillating—whole Regiments and garrisons are vacillating. To foreigners our strong holds are entrusted; To that suspected Schafgotch is the whole Force of Silesia given up: to Tertsky Five regiments, foot and horse—to Isolani, To Illo, Kinsky, Butler, the best troops. Max. Likewise to both of us. Octavio. Because the Duke Believes he has secured us—means to lure us Still further on by splendid promises. To me he portions forth the princedoms, Glatz And Sagan; and too plain I see the angle With which he doubts not to catch thee. Max. No! no! I tell thee—no! Octavio. O open yet thine eyes! And to what purpose think'st thou he has called us Hither to Pilsen?—to avail himself Of our advice?—O when did Friedland ever Need our advice?—Be calm, and listen to me. To sell ourselves are we called hither, and, Decline we that—to be his hostages. Therefore doth noble Galas stand aloof; Thy father, too, thou would'st not have seen here, If higher duties had not held him fettered. Max. He makes no secret of it—needs make none— That we're called hither for his sake—he owns it. He needs our aidance to maintain himself— He did so much for us; and 'tis but fair That we too should do somewhat now for him. Octavio. And know'st thou what it is which we must do? That Illo's drunken mood betrayed it to thee. Bethink thyself—what hast thou heard, what seen? The counterfeited paper—the omission Of that particular clause, so full of meaning, Does it not prove, that they would bind us down To nothing good? Max. That counterfeited paper Appears to me no other than a trick Of Illo's own device. These underhand Traders in great men's interests ever use To urge and hurry all things to the extreme. They see the Duke at variance with the court, And fondly think to serve him, when they widen The breach irreparably. Trust me, father, The Duke knows nothing of all this. Octavio. It grieves me That I must dash to earth, that I must shatter A faith so specious; but I may not spare thee! For this is not a time for tenderness. Thou must take measures, speedy ones—must act. I therefore will confess to thee, that all Which I've entrusted to thee now—that all Which seems to thee so unbelievable, That—yes, I will tell thee—Max! I had it all From his own mouth—from the Duke's mouth I had it. Max. No!—no!—never! Octavio. Himself confided to me What I, 'tis true, had long before discovered By other means—himself confided to me, That 'twas his settled plan to join the Swedes; And, at the head of the united armies, Compel the Emperor— Max. He is passionate. The Court has stung him—he is sore all over With injuries and affronts; and in a moment Of irritation, what if he, for once, Forgot himself? He's an impetuous man. Octavio. Nay, in cold blood he did confess this to me: And having construed my astonishment Into a scruple of his power, he shewed me His written evidences—shewed me letters, Both from the Saxon and the Swede, that gave Promise of aidance, and defin'd the amount. Max. It cannot be! — can not be! can not be! Dost thou not see, it cannot! Thou wouldest of necessity have shewn him Such horror, such deep loathing—that or he Had taken thee for his better genius, or Thou stood'st not now a living man before me— Octavio. I have laid open my objections to him, Dissuaded him with pressing earnestness; But my abhorrence, the full sentiment Of my whole heart—that I have still kept sacred To my own consciousness. Max. And thou hast been So treacherous? That looks not like my father! I trusted not thy words, when thou didst tell me Evil of him; much less can I now do it, That thou calumniatest thy own self. Octavio. I did not thrust myself into his secrecy. Max. Uprightness merited his confidence. Octavio. He was no longer worthy of sincerity. Max. Dissimulation, sure, was still less worthy Of thee, Octavio! Octavio. Gave I him a cause To entertain a scruple of my honour? Max. That he did not, evinced his confidence. Octavio. Dear son, it is not always possible Still to preserve that infant purity Which the voice teaches in our inmost heart. Still in alarm, for ever on the watch Against the wiles of wicked men, e'en Virtue Will sometimes bear away her outward robes Soiled in the wrestle with Iniquity. This is the curse of every evil deed, That, propagating still, it brings forth evil. I do not cheat my better soul with sophisms: I but perform my orders; the Emperor Prescribes my conduct to me. Dearest boy, Far better were it, doubtless, if we all Obeyed the heart at all times; but so doing, In this our present sojourn with bad men, We must abandon many an honest object. 'Tis now our call to serve the Emperor, By what means he can best be served—the heart May whisper what it will—this is our call! Max. It seems a thing appointed, that to-day I should not comprehend, not understand thee. The Duke thou say'st did honestly pour out His heart to thee, but for an evil purpose; And thou dishonestly hast cheated him For a good purpose! Silence, I entreat thee— My friend thou stealest not from me— Let me not lose my father! Octavio. As yet thou know'st not all, my son. I have Yet somewhat to disclose to thee. [After a pause. Duke Friedland Hath made his preparations. He relies Upon his stars. He deems us unprovided, And thinks to fall upon us by surprise. Yea, in his dream of hope, he grasps already The golden circle in his hand. He errs. We too have been in action—he but grasps His evil fate, most evil, most mysterious! Max. O nothing rash, my sire! By all that's good Let me invoke thee—no precipitation! Octavio. With light tread stole he on his evil way, With light tread hath Vengeance stole on after him. Unseen she stands already, dark behind him— But one step more—he shudders in her grasp! Thou hast seen Questenberg with me. As yet Thou know'st but his ostensible commission; He brought with him a private one, my son! And that was for me only. Max. May I know it? Octavio (seizes the patent). Max! [A pause. —In this disclosure place I in thy hands The Empire's welfare and thy father's life. Dear to thy inmost heart is Wallenstein: A powerful tie of love, of veneration, Hath knit thee to him from thy earliest youth. Thou nourishest the wish.—O let me still Anticipate thy loitering confidence! The hope thou nourishest to knit thyself Yet closer to him— Max. Father— Octavio. O my son! I trust thy heart undoubtingly. But am I Equally sure of thy collectedness? Wilt thou be able, with calm countenance, To enter this man's presence, when that I Have trusted to thee his whole fate? Max. According As thou dost trust me, father, with his crime. [Octavio takes a paper out of his escrutoire, and gives it to him. Max. What? how? a full Imperial patent! Octavio. Read it. Max (just glances on it). Duke Friedland sentenced and condemned! Octavio. Even so. Max (throws down the paper). O this is too much! O unhappy error! Octavio. Read on. Collect thyself. Max (after he has read further, with a look of affright and astonishment on his father). How! what! Thou! thou! Octavio. But for the present moment, till the King Of Hungary may safely join the army, Is the command assigned to me. Max. And think'st thou, Dost thou believe, that thou wilt tear it from him? O never hope it!—Father! father! father! An inauspicious office is enjoined thee. This paper here—this! and wilt thou enforce it? The mighty in the middle of his host, Surrounded by his thousands, him would'st thou Disarm—degrade! Thou art lost, both thou and all of us. Octavio. What hazard I incur thereby, I know. In the great hand of God I stand. The Almighty Will cover with his shield the Imperial house, And shatter, in his wrath, the work of darkness. The Emperor hath true servants still; and even Here in the camp, there are enough brave men, Who for the good cause will fight gallantly. The faithful have been warned—the dangerous Are closely watched. I wait but the first step, And then immediately— Max. What! on suspicion? Immediately? Octavio. The Emperor is no tyrant. The deed alone he'll punish, not the wish. The Duke hath yet his destiny in his power. Let him but leave the treason uncompleted, He will be silently displaced from office, And make way to his Emperor's royal son. An honourable exile to his castles Will be a benefaction to him rather Than punishment. But the first open step— Max. What callest thou such a step? A wicked step Ne'er will he take; but thou mightest easily, Yea, thou hast done it, misinterpret him. Octavio. Nay, howsoever punishable were Duke Friedland's purposes, yet still the steps Which he hath taken openly, permit A mild construction. It is my intention To leave this paper wholly uninforced Till some act is committed which convicts him Of a high-treason, without doubt or plea, And that shall sentence him. Max. But who the judge? Octavio. Thyself. Max. For ever, then, this paper will lie idle. Octavio. Too soon, I fear, its powers must all be proved. After the counter-promise of this evening, It cannot be but he must deem himself Secure of the majority with us; And of the army's general sentiment He hath a pleasing proof in that petition Which thou delivered'st to him from the regiments. Add this too—I have letters that the Rhinegrave Hath changed his route, and travels by forced marches To the Bohemian Forest. What this purports, Remains unknown; and, to confirm suspicion, This night a Swedish nobleman arrived here. Max. I have thy word. Thou'lt not proceed to action Before thou hast convinced me—me myself. Octavio. Is it possible? Still, after all thou know'st, Canst thou believe still in his innocence? Max. Thy judgment may mistake; my heart can not. These reasons might expound thy spirit or mine; But they expound not Friedland—I have faith: For as he knits his fortunes to the stars, Even so doth he resemble them in secret, Wonderful, still inexplicable courses! Trust me, they do him wrong. All will be solved. These smokes, at once, will kindle into flame— The edges of this black and stormy cloud Will brighten suddenly, and we shall view The Unapproachable glide out in splendour. Octavio. I will await it. Scene II Octavio and Max as before. To them the Valet of the Chamber. Octavio. How now, then? Valet. A dispatch is at the door. Octavio. So early? From whom comes he then? Who is it? Valet. That he refused to tell me. Octavio. Lead him in: And, hark you—let it not transpire. [Exit Valet—the Cornet steps in. Octavio. Ha! Cornet—is it you? and from Count Galas? Give me your letters. Cornet. The Lieutenant-General Trusted it not to letters. Octavio. And what is it? Cornet. He bade me tell you—Dare I speak openly here? Octavio. My son knows all. Cornet. We have him. Octavio. Whom? Cornet. Sesina, The old negotiator. Octavio. And you have him? Cornet. In the Bohemian Forest Captain Mohrbrand Found and secured him yester morning early: He was proceeding then to Regenspurg, And on him were dispatches for the Swede. Octavio. And the dispatches— Cornet. The Lieutenant-General Sent them that instant to Vienna, and The prisoner with them. Octavio. This is, indeed, a tiding! That fellow is a precious casket to us, Enclosing weighty things.—Was much found on him? Cornet. I think, six packets, with Count Tertsky's arms. Octavio. None in the Duke's own hand? Cornet. Not that I know. Octavio. And old Sesina? Cornet. He was sorely frightened, When it was told him he must to Vienna. But the Count Altringer bade him take heart, Would he but make a full and free confession. Octavio. Is Altringer then with your Lord? I heard That he lay sick at Linz. Cornet. These three days past He's with my master, the Lieutenant-General, At Frauenberg. Already have they sixty Small companies together, chosen men; Respectfully they greet you with assurances, That they are only waiting your commands. Octavio. In a few days may great events take place. And when must you return? Cornet. I wait your orders. Octavio. Remain till evening. [Cornet signifies his assent and obeisance, and is going. Octavio. No one saw you—ha? Cornet. No living creature. Through the cloister wicket The Capuchins, as usual, let me in. Octavio. Go, rest your limbs, and keep yourself concealed. I hold it probable, that yet ere evening I shall dispatch you. The development Of this affair approaches: ere the day, That even now is dawning in the heaven, Ere this eventful day hath set, the lot That must decide our fortunes will be drawn. [Exit Cornet. Scene III Octavio and Max Piccolomini. Octavio. Well—and what now, son? All will soon be clear; For all, I'm certain, went through that Sesina. Max. I will procure me light a shorter way. Farewell. Octavio. Where now?—Remain here. Max. To the Duke. Octavio. What— Max. If thou hast believed that I shall act A part in this thy play— Thou hast miscalculated on me grievously. My way must be straight on. True with the tongue, False with the heart—I may not, cannot be: Nor can I suffer that a man should trust me— As his friend trust me—and then lull my conscience With such low pleas as these:—‘I ask'd him not— He did it all at his own hazard—and My mouth has never lied to him.’—No, no! What a friend takes me for, that I must be. —I'll to the Duke; ere yet this day is ended Will I demand of him that he do save His good name from the world, and with one stride Break through and rend this fine-spun web of yours. He can, he will!—I still am his believer. Yet I'll not pledge myself, but that those letters May furnish you, perchance, with proofs against him. How far may not this Tertsky have proceeded— What may not he himself too have permitted Himself to do, to snare the enemy, The laws of war excusing? Nothing, save His own mouth shall convict him—nothing less! And face to face will I go question him. Octavio. Thou wilt? Max. I will, as sure as this heart beats. Octavio. I have, indeed, miscalculated on thee. I calculated on a prudent son, Who would have blest the hand beneficent That plucked him back from the abyss—and lo! A fascinated being I discover, Whom his two eyes befool, whom passion wilders, Whom not the broadest light of noon can heal. Go, question him!—Be mad enough, I pray thee. The purpose of thy father, of thy Emperor, Go, give it up free booty:—Force me, drive me To an open breach before the time. And now, Now that a miracle of heaven had guarded My secret purpose even to this hour, And laid to sleep Suspicion's piercing eyes, Let me have lived to see that mine own son, With frantic enterprise, annihilates My toilsome labours and state-policy. Max. Aye—this state-policy! O how I curse it! You will some time, with your state-policy, Compel him to the measure: it may happen, Because ye are determined that he is guilty, Guilty ye'll make him. All retreat cut off, You close up every outlet, hem him in Narrower and narrower, till at length ye force him— Yes, ye,—ye force him, in his desperation, To set fire to his prison. Father! Father! That never can end well—it cannot—will not! And let it be decided as it may, I see with boding heart the near approach Of an ill-starred unblest catastrophe. For this great Monarch-spirit, if he fall, Will drag a world into the ruin with him. And as a ship (that midway on the ocean Takes fire) at once, and with a thunder-burst Explodes, and with itself shoots out its crew In smoke and ruin betwixt sea and heaven; So will he, falling, draw down in his fall All us, who're fixed and mortised to his fortune. Deem of it what thou wilt; but pardon me, That I must bear me on in my own way. All must remain pure betwixt him and me; And, ere the day-light dawns, it must be known Which I must lose—my father, or my friend. [During his exit the curtain drops. ACT IV Scene I Scene—A Room fitted up for astrological Labours, and provided with celestial Charts, with Globes, Telescopes, Quadrants, and other mathematical Instruments.—Seven Colossal Figures, representing the Planets, each with a transparent Star of a different Colour on its Head, stand in a Semi-circle in the Back-ground, so that Mars and Saturn are nearest the Eye.— The remainder of the Scene, and its Disposition, is given in the Fourth Scene of the Second Act.—There must be a Curtain over the Figures, which may be dropped, and conceal them on Occasions. [In the Fifth Scene of this Act it must be dropped; but in the Seventh Scene, it must be again drawn up wholly or in part.] Wallenstein at a black Table, on which a Speculum Astrologicum is described with Chalk. Seni is taking Observations through a window. Wallenstein. All well—and now let it be ended, Seni.—Come, The dawn commences, and Mars rules the hour. We must give o'er the operation. Come, We know enough. Seni. Your Highness must permit me Just to contemplate Venus. She's now rising: Like as a sun, so shines she in the east. Wallenstein. She is at present in her perigee, And shoots down now her strongest influences. [Contemplating the figure on the table. Auspicious aspect! fateful in conjunction, At length the mighty three corradiate; And the two stars of blessing, Jupiter And Venus, take between them the malignant Slily-malicious Mars, and thus compel Into my service that old mischief-founder; For long he viewed me hostilely, and ever With beam oblique, or perpendicular, Now in the Quartile, now in the Secundan, Shot his red lightnings at my stars, disturbing Their blessed influences and sweet aspects. Now they have conquered the old enemy, And bring him in the heavens a prisoner to me. Seni (who has come down from the window). And in a corner house, your Highness—think of that! That makes each influence of double strength. Wallenstein. And sun and moon, too, in the Sextile aspect, The soft light with the vehement—so I love it. Sol is the heart, Luna the head of heaven, Bold be the plan, fiery the execution. Seni. And both the mighty Lumina by no Maleficus affronted. Lo! Saturnus, Innocuous, powerless, in cadente Domo. Wallenstein. The empire of Saturnus is gone by; Lord of the secret birth of things is he; Within the lap of earth, and in the depths Of the imagination dominates; And his are all things that eschew the light. The time is o'er of brooding and contrivance; For Jupiter, the lustrous, lordeth now, And the dark work, complete of preparation, He draws by force into the realm of light. Now must we hasten on to action, ere The scheme, and most auspicious positure Parts o'er my head, and takes once more its flight; For the heavens journey still, and sojourn not. [There are knocks at the door. There's some one knocking there. See who it is. Tertsky (from without). Open, and let me in. Wallenstein. Aye—'tis Tertsky. What is there of such urgence? We are busy. Tertsky (from without). Lay all aside at present, I entreat you. It suffers no delaying. Wallenstein. Open, Seni! [While Seni opens the doors for Tertsky, Wallenstein draws the curtain over the figures. Tertsky (enters). Hast thou already heard it? He is taken. Galas has given him up to the Emperor. [Seni draws off the black table, and exit. Scene II Wallenstein, Count Tertsky. Wallenstein (to Tertsky). Who has been taken?—Who is given up? Tertsky. The man who knows our secrets, who knows every Negotiation with the Swede and Saxon, Through whose hands all and every thing has passed— Wallenstein (drawing back). Nay, not Sesina?—Say, No! I entreat thee. Tertsky. All on his road for Regenspurg to the Swede He was plunged down upon by Galas' agent, Who had been long in ambush, lurking for him. There must have been found on him my whole packet To Thur, to Kinsky, to Oxenstirn, to Arnheim: All this is in their hands; they have now an insight Into the whole—our measures, and our motives. Scene III To them enters Illo. Illo (to Tertsky). Has he heard it? Tertsky. He has heard it. Illo (to Wallenstein). Thinkest thou still To make thy peace with the Emperor, to regain His confidence?—E'en were it now thy wish To abandon all thy plans, yet still they know What thou hast wished; then forwards thou must press; Retreat is now no longer in thy power. Tertsky. They have documents against us, and in hands, Which shew beyond all power of contradiction— Wallenstein. Of my hand-writing—no iota. Thee I punish for thy lies. Illo. And thou believest, That what this man, that what thy sister's husband, Did in thy name, will not stand on thy reck'ning? His word must pass for thy word with the Swede, And not with those that hate thee at Vienna. Tertsky. In writing thou gav'st nothing—But bethink thee, How far thou ventured'st by word of mouth With this Sesina? And will he be silent? If he can save himself by yielding up Thy secret purposes, will he retain them? Illo. Thyself dost not conceive it possible; And since they now have evidence authentic How far thou hast already gone, speak!—tell us, What art thou waiting for? thou canst no longer Keep thy command; and beyond hope of rescue Thou'rt lost, if thou resign'st it. Wallenstein. In the army Lies my security. The army will not Abandon me. Whatever they may know, The power is mine, and they must gulp it down— And substitute I caution for my fealty, They must be satisfied, at least appear so. Illo. The army, Duke, is thine now—for this moment— 'Tis thine: but think with terror on the slow, The quiet power of time. From open violence The attachment of thy soldiery secures thee To-day—to-morrow; but grant'st thou them a respite, Unheard, unseen, they'll undermine that love On which thou now dost feel so firm a footing, With wily theft will draw away from thee One after the other— Wallenstein. 'Tis a curséd accident! Illo. O, I will call it a most blessed one, If it work on thee as it ought to do, Hurry thee on to action—to decision. The Swedish General— Wallenstein. He's arrived! Know'st thou What his commission is— Illo. To thee alone Will he entrust the purpose of his coming. Wallenstein. A curséd, curséd accident! Yes, yes, Sesina knows too much, and won't be silent. Tertsky. He's a Bohemian fugitive and rebel, His neck is forfeit. Can he save himself At thy cost, think you he will scruple it? And if they put him to the torture, will he, Will he, that dastardling, have strength enough— Wallenstein. Their confidence is lost—irreparably! And I may act what way I will, I shall Be and remain for ever in their thought A traitor to my country. How sincerely Soever I return back to my duty, It will no longer help me— Illo. Ruin thee, That it will do! Not thy fidelity, Thy weakness will be deemed the sole occasion— Wallenstein. What! I must realize it now in earnest, Because I toy'd too freely with the thought? Accurséd he who dallies with a devil! And must I—I must realize it now— Now, while I have the power, it must take place? Illo. Now—now—ere they can ward and parry it! Wallenstein (looking at the paper of signatures). I have the Generals' word—a written promise! Max Piccolomini stands not here—how's that? Tertsky. It was—he fancied— Illo. Mere self-willedness. There needed no such thing 'twixt him and you. Wallenstein. He is quite right—there needeth no such thing. The regiments, too, deny to march for Flanders— Have sent me in a paper of remonstrance, And openly resist the Imperial orders. The first step to revolt's already taken. Illo. Believe me, thou wilt find it far more easy To lead them over to the enemy Than to the Spaniard. Wallenstein. I will hear, however, What the Swede has to say to me. Illo (to Tertsky). Go, call him! He stands without the door in waiting. Wallenstein. Stay! Stay yet a little. It hath taken me All by surprise,—it came too quick upon me; 'Tis wholly novel, that an accident, With its dark lordship, and blind agency, Should force me on with it. Illo. First hear him only, And after weigh it. [Exeunt Tertsky and Illo. Scene IV Wallenstein. Is it possible? Is't so? I can no longer what I would? No longer draw back at my liking? I Must do the deed, because I thought of it, And fed this heart here with a dream? Because I did not scowl temptation from my presence, Dallied with thoughts of possible fulfilment, Commenced no movement, left all time uncertain, And only kept the road, the access open? By the great God of Heaven! it was not My serious meaning, it was ne'er resolve. I but amused myself with thinking of it. The free-will tempted me, the power to do Or not to do it.—Was it criminal To make the fancy minister to hope, To fill the air with pretty toys of air, And clutch fantastic sceptres moving t'ward me? Was not the will kept free? Beheld I not The road of duty close beside me—but One little step, and once more I was in it! Where am I? Whither have I been transported? No road, no track behind me, but a wall, Impenetrable, insurmountable, Rises obedient to the spells I muttered And meant not—my own doings tower behind me. A punishable man I seem, the guilt, Try what I will, I cannot roll off from me; The equivocal demeanour of my life Bears witness on my prosecutor's party; And even my purest acts from purest motives Suspicion poisons with malicious gloss. Were I that thing, for which I pass, that traitor, A goodly outside I had sure reserved, Had drawn the coverings thick and double round me, Been calm and chary of my utterance. But being conscious of the innocence Of my intent, my uncorrupted will, I gave way to my humours, to my passion: Bold were my words, because my deeds were not. Now every planless measure, chance event, The threat of rage, the vaunt of joy and triumph, And all the May-games of a heart o'erflowing, Will they connect, and weave them all together Into one web of treason; all will be plan, My eye ne'er absent from the far-off mark, Step tracing step, each step a politic progress; And out of all they'll fabricate a charge So specious, that I must myself stand dumb. I am caught in my own net, and only force, Naught but a sudden rent can liberate me. How else! since that the heart's unbiass'd instinct Impelled me to the daring deed, which now Necessity, self-preservation, orders. Stern is the On-look of Necessity, Not without shudder many a human hand Grasps the mysterious urn of destiny. My deed was mine, remaining in my bosom, Once suffered to escape from its safe corner Within the heart, its nursery and birthplace, Sent forth into the Foreign, it belongs For ever to those sly malicious powers Whom never art of man conciliated. What is thy enterprize? thy aim? thy object? Hast honestly confessed it to thyself? Power seated on a quiet throne thou'dst shake, Power on an ancient consecrated throne, Strong in possession, founded in old custom; Power by a thousand tough and stringy roots Fixed to the people's pious nursery-faith. This, this will be no strife of strength with strength. That feared I not. I brave each combatant, Whom I can look on, fixing eye to eye, Who full himself of courage kindles courage In me too. 'Tis a foe invisible, The which I fear—a fearful enemy, Which in the human heart opposes me, By its coward fear alone made fearful to me. Not that, which full of life, instinct with power, Makes known its present being, that is not The true, the perilously formidable. O no! it is the common, the quite common, The thing of an eternal yesterday, What ever was, and evermore returns, Sterling to-morrow, for to-day 'twas sterling! For of the wholly common is man made, And custom is his nurse! Woe then to them, Who lay irreverent hands upon his old House furniture, the dear inheritance From his forefathers. For time consecrates; And what is grey with age becomes religion. Be in possession, and thou hast the right, And sacred will the many guard it for thee! [To the Page, who here enters. The Swedish officer?—Well, let him enter. [The Page exit, Wallenstein fixes his eye in deep thought on the door. Yet is it pure—as yet!—the crime has come Not o'er this threshold yet—so slender is The boundary that divideth life's two paths. Scene V Wallenstein and Wrangel. Wallenstein. Your name is Wrangel? Wrangel. Gustave Wrangel, General Of the Sudermanian Blues. Wallenstein. It was a Wrangel Who injured me materially at Stralsund, And by his brave resistance was the cause Of the opposition which that sea-port made. Wrangel. It was the doing of the element With which you fought, my Lord! and not my merit. The Baltic Neptune did assert his freedom, The sea and land, it seemed, were not to serve One and the same. Wallenstein (makes a motion for him to take a seat, and seats himself). And where are your credentials? Come you provided with full powers, Sir General? Wrangel. There are so many scruples yet to solve— Wallenstein (having read the credentials). An able letter!—Ay—he is a prudent, Intelligent master, whom you serve, Sir General! The Chancellor writes me, that he but fulfils His late departed Sovereign's own idea In helping me to the Bohemian crown. Wrangel. He says the truth. Our great King, now in heaven, Did ever deem most highly of your Grace's Pre-eminent sense and military genius; And always the commanding Intellect, He said, should have command, and be the King. Wallenstein. Yes, he might say it safely.—General Wrangel, [Taking his hand. Come, fair and open—Trust me, I was always A Swede at heart. Ey! that did you experience Both in Silesia and at Nuremburg; I had you often in my power, and let you Always slip out by some back door or other. 'Tis this for which the Court can ne'er forgive me, Which drives me to this present step: and since Our interests so run in one direction, E'en let us have a thorough confidence Each in the other. Wrangel. Confidence will come Has each but only first security. Wallenstein. The Chancellor still, I see, does not quite trust me; And, I confess—the gain does not wholly lie To my advantage—Without doubt he thinks If I can play false with the Emperor, Who is my Sov'reign, I can do the like With the enemy, and that the one too were Sooner to be forgiven me than the other. Is not this your opinion too, Sir General? Wrangel. I have here an office merely, no opinion. Wallenstein. The Emperor hath urged me to the uttermost. I can no longer honourably serve him. For my security, in self-defence, I take this hard step, which my conscience blames. Wrangel. That I believe. So far would no one go Who was not forced to it. [After a pause. What may have impelled Your princely Highness in this wise to act Toward your Sovereign Lord and Emperor, Beseems not us to expound or criticize. The Swede is fighting for his good old cause, With his good sword and conscience. This concurrence, This opportunity, is in our favour, And all advantages in war are lawful. We take what offers without questioning; And if all have its due and just proportions— Wallenstein. Of what then are ye doubting? Of my will? Or of my power? I pledged me to the Chancellor, Would he trust me with sixteen thousand men, That I would instantly go over to them With eighteen thousand of the Emperor's troops. Wrangel. Your Grace is known to be a mighty war-chief, To be a second Attila and Pyrrhus. 'Tis talked of still with fresh astonishment, How some years past, beyond all human faith, You called an army forth, like a creation: But yet— Wallenstein. But yet? Wrangel. But still the Chancellor thinks, It might yet be an easier thing from nothing To call forth sixty thousand men of battle, Than to persuade one sixtieth part of them— Wallenstein. What now? Out with it, friend! Wrangel. To break their oaths. Wallenstein. And he thinks so?—He judges like a Swede, And like a Protestant. You Lutherans Fight for your Bible. You are interested About the cause; and with your hearts you follow Your banners.—Among you, whoe'er deserts To the enemy, hath broken covenant With two Lords at one time.—We've no such fancies. Wrangel. Great God in Heaven! Have then the people here No house and home, no fire-side, no altar? Wallenstein. I will explain that to you, how it stands— The Austrian has a country, ay, and loves it, And has good cause to love it—but this army, That calls itself the Imperial, this that houses Here in Bohemia, this has none—no country; This is an outcast of all foreign lands, Unclaimed by town or tribe, to whom belongs Nothing, except the universal sun. Wrangel. But then the Nobles and the Officers? Such a desertion, such a felony, It is without example, my Lord Duke, In the world's history. Wallenstein. They are all mine— Mine unconditionally—mine on all terms. Not me, your own eyes you must trust. [He gives him the paper containing the written oath. Wrangel reads it through, and, having read it, lays it on the table, remaining silent. So then? Now comprehend you? Wrangel. Comprehend who can! My Lord Duke; I will let the mask drop—yes! I've full powers for a final settlement. The Rhinegrave stands but four days' march from here With fifteen thousand men, and only waits For orders to proceed and join your army. Those orders I give out, immediately We're compromised. Wallenstein. What asks the Chancellor? Wrangel. Twelve Regiments, every man a Swede—my head The warranty—and all might prove at last Only false play— Wallenstein (starting). Sir Swede! Wrangel. Am therefore forced T'insist thereon, that he do formally, Irrevocably break with the Emperor, Else not a Swede is trusted to Duke Friedland. Wallenstein. Come, brief and open! What is the demand? Wrangel. That he forthwith disarm the Spanish regiments Attached to the Emperor, that he seize Prague, And to the Swedes give up that city, with The strong pass Egra. Wallenstein. That is much indeed! Prague!—Egra's granted— But—but Prague!— 'Twon't do. I give you every security Which you may ask of me in common reason— But Prague—Bohemia—these, Sir General, I can myself protect. Wrangel. We doubt it not. But 'tis not the protection that is now Our sole concern. We want security, That we shall not expend our men and money All to no purpose. Wallenstein. 'Tis but reasonable. Wrangel. And till we are indemnified, so long Stays Prague in pledge. Wallenstein. Then trust you us so little? Wrangel (rising). The Swede, if he would treat well with the German, Must keep a sharp look-out. We have been called Over the Baltic, we have saved the empire From ruin—with our best blood have we seal'd The liberty of faith, and gospel truth. But now already is the benefaction No longer felt, the load alone is felt.— Ye look askance with evil eye upon us, As foreigners, intruders in the empire, And would fain send us, with some paltry sum Of money, home again to our old forests. No, no! my Lord Duke! no!—it never was For Judas' pay, for chinking gold and silver, That we did leave our King by the Great Stone. No, not for gold and silver have there bled So many of our Swedish Nobles—neither Will we, with empty laurels for our payment, Hoist sail for our own country. Citizens Will we remain upon the soil, the which Our Monarch conquered for himself, and died. Wallenstein. Help to keep down the common enemy, And the fair border land must needs be yours. Wrangel. But when the common enemy lies vanquished, Who knits together our new friendship then? We know, Duke Friedland! though perhaps the Swede Ought not t' have known it, that you carry on Secret negotiations with the Saxons. Who is our warranty, that we are not The sacrifices in those articles Which 'tis thought needful to conceal from us? Wallenstein (rises). Think you of something better, Gustave Wrangel! Of Prague no more. Wrangel. Here my commission ends. Wallenstein. Surrender up to you my capital! Far liever would I face about, and step Back to my Emperor. Wrangel. If time yet permits— Wallenstein. That lies with me, even now, at any hour. Wrangel. Some days ago, perhaps. To-day, no longer, No longer since Sesina is a prisoner. My Lord Duke, hear me—We believe that you At present do mean honourably by us. Since yesterday we're sure of that—and now This paper warrants for the troops, there's nothing Stands in the way of our full confidence. Prague shall not part us. Hear! The Chancellor Contents himself with Albstadt, to your Grace He gives up Ratschin and the narrow side, But Egra above all must open to us, Ere we can think of any junction. Wallenstein. You, You therefore must I trust, and you not me? I will consider of your proposition. Wrangel. I must entreat, that your consideration Occupy not too long a time. Already Has this negotiation, my Lord Duke! Crept on into the second year. If nothing Is settled this time, will the Chancellor Consider it as broken off for ever. Wallenstein. Ye press me hard. A measure, such as this, Ought to be thought of. Wrangel. Ay! but think of this too, That sudden action only can procure it Success—think first of this, your Highness. [Exit Wrangel. Scene VI Wallenstein, Tertsky, and Illo (re-enter). Illo. Is't all right? Tertsky. Are you compromised? Illo. This Swede Went smiling from you. Yes! you're compromised. Wallenstein. As yet is nothing settled: and (well weighed) I feel myself inclined to leave it so. Tertsky. How? What is that? Wallenstein. Come on me what will come, The doing evil to avoid an evil Cannot be good! Tertsky. Nay, but bethink you, Duke? Wallenstein. To live upon the mercy of these Swedes! Of these proud-hearted Swedes! I could not bear it. Illo. Goest thou as fugitive, as mendicant? Bringest thou not more to them than thou receivest? Scene VII To these enter the Countess Tertsky. Wallenstein. Who sent for you? There is no business here For women. Countess. I am come to bid you joy. Wallenstein. Use thy authority, Tertsky, bid her go. Countess. Come I perhaps too early? I hope not. Wallenstein. Set not this tongue upon me, I entreat you. You know it is the weapon that destroys me. I am routed, if a woman but attack me. I cannot traffic in the trade of words With that unreasoning sex. Countess. I had already Given the Bohemians a king. Wallenstein. They have one, In consequence, no doubt. Countess. Ha! what new scruple? Tertsky. The Duke will not. Countess. He will not what he must! Illo. It lies with you now. Try. For I am silenced, When folks begin to talk to me of conscience, And of fidelity. Countess. How? then, when all Lay in the far-off distance, when the road Stretched out before thine eyes interminably, Then hadst thou courage and resolve; and now, Now that the dream is being realized, The purpose ripe, the issue ascertained, Dost thou begin to play the dastard now? Planned merely, 'tis a common felony; Accomplished, an immortal undertaking: And with success comes pardon hand in hand; For all event is God's arbitrement. Servant (enters). The Colonel Piccolomini. Countess. —Must wait. Wallenstein. I cannot see him now. Another time. Servant. But for two minutes he entreats an audience. Of the most urgent nature is his business. Wallenstein. Who knows what he may bring us? I will hear him. Countess. Urgent for him, no doubt; but thou mayest wait. Wallenstein. What is it? Countess. Thou shalt be informed hereafter. First let the Swede and thee be compromised. [Exit Servant. Wallenstein. If there were yet a choice! if yet some milder Way of escape were possible—I still Will choose it, and avoid the last extreme. Countess. Desir'st thou nothing further? Such a way Lies still before thee. Send this Wrangel off. Forget thou thy old hopes, cast far away All thy past life; determine to commence A new one. Virtue hath her heroes too, As well as Fame and Fortune.—To Vienna— Hence—to the Emperor—kneel before the throne; Take a full coffer with thee—say aloud, Thou did'st but wish to prove thy fealty; Thy whole intention but to dupe the Swede. Illo. For that too 'tis too late. They know too much. He would but bear his own head to the block. Countess. I fear not that. They have not evidence To attaint him legally, and they avoid The avowal of an arbitrary power. They'll let the Duke resign without disturbance. I see how all will end. The King of Hungary Makes his appearance, and 'twill of itself Be understood, that then the Duke retires. There will not want a formal declaration. The young King will administer the oath To the whole army; and so all returns To the old position. On some morrow morning The Duke departs; and now 'tis stir and bustle Within his castles. He will hunt, and build, Superintend his horses' pedigrees; Creates himself a court, gives golden keys, And introduceth strictest ceremony In fine proportions, and nice etiquette; Keeps open table with high cheer; in brief, Commenceth mighty King—in miniature. And while he prudently demeans himself, And gives himself no actual importance, He will be let appear whate'er he likes; And who dares doubt, that Friedland will appear A mighty Prince to his last dying hour? Well now, what then? Duke Friedland is as others, A fire-new Noble, whom the war hath raised To price and currency, a Jonah's Gourd, An over-night creation of court-favour, Which with an undistinguishable ease Makes Baron or makes Prince. Wallenstein. Take her away. Let in the young Count Piccolomini. Countess. Art thou in earnest? I entreat thee! Canst thou Consent to bear thyself to thy own grave, So ignominiously to be dried up? Thy life, that arrogated such a height To end in such a nothing! To be nothing, When one was always nothing, is an evil That asks no stretch of patience, a light evil, But to become a nothing, having been— Wallenstein (starts up). Shew me a way out of this stifling crowd, Ye Powers of Aidance! Shew me such a way As I am capable of going.—I Am no tongue-hero, no fine virtue-prattler; I cannot warm by thinking; cannot say To the good luck that turns her back upon me, Magnanimously: ‘Go! I need thee not.’ Cease I to work, I am annihilated. Dangers nor sacrifices will I shun, If so I may avoid the last extreme; But ere I sink down into nothingness, Leave off so little, who began so great, Ere that the world confuses me with those Poor wretches, whom a day creates and crumbles, This age and after-ages speak my name With hate and dread; and Friedland be redemption For each accurséd deed! Countess. What is there here, then, So against nature? Help me to perceive it! O let not Superstition's nightly goblins Subdue thy clear bright spirit! Art thou bid To murder?—with abhorr'd accurséd poniard, To violate the breasts that nourished thee? That were against our nature, that might aptly Make thy flesh shudder, and thy whole heart sicken. Yet not a few, and for a meaner object, Have ventured even this, ay, and performed it. What is there in thy case so black and monstrous? Thou art accused of treason—whether with Or without justice is not now the question— Thou art lost if thou dost not avail thee quickly Of the power which thou possessest—Friedland! Duke! Tell me, where lives that thing so meek and tame, That doth not all his living faculties Put forth in preservation of his life? What deed so daring, which necessity And desperation will not sanctify? Wallenstein. Once was this Ferdinand so gracious to me: He loved me; he esteemed me; I was placed The nearest to his heart. Full many a time We like familiar friends, both at one table, Have banquetted together. He and I— And the young kings themselves held me the bason Wherewith to wash me—and is't come to this? Countess. So faithfully preserv'st thou each small favour, And hast no memory for contumelies? Must I remind thee, how at Regenspurg This man repaid thy faithful services? All ranks and all conditions in the Empire Thou hadst wronged, to make him great,—hadst loaded on thee, On thee, the hate, the curse of the whole world. No friend existed for thee in all Germany, And why? because thou hadst existed only For the Emperor. To the Emperor alone Clung Friedland in that storm which gathered round him At Regenspurg in the Diet—and he dropped thee! He let thee fall! He let thee fall a victim To the Bavarian, to that insolent! Deposed, stript bare of all thy dignity And power, amid the taunting of thy foes, Thou wert let drop into obscurity.— Say not, the restoration of thy honour Hath made atonement for that first injustice. No honest good-will was it that replaced thee, The law of hard necessity replaced thee, Which they had fain opposed, but that they could not. Wallenstein. Not to their good wishes, that is certain, Nor yet to his affection I'm indebted For this high office; and if I abuse it, I shall therein abuse no confidence. Countess. Affection! confidence!—They needed thee. Necessity, impetuous remonstrant! Who not with empty names, or shews of proxy, Is served, who'll have the thing and not the symbol, Ever seeks out the greatest and the best, And at the rudder places him, e'en though She had been forced to take him from the rabble— She, this Necessity, it was that placed thee In this high office, it was she that gave thee Thy letters patent of inauguration. For, to the uttermost moment that they can, This race still help themselves at cheapest rate With slavish souls, with puppets! At the approach Of extreme peril, when a hollow image Is found a hollow image and no more, Then falls the power into the mighty hands Of Nature, of the spirit giant-born, Who listens only to himself, knows nothing Of stipulations, duties, reverences And, like the emancipated force of fire, Unmastered scorches, ere it reaches them, Their fine-spun webs, their artificial policy. Wallenstein. 'Tis true! they saw me always as I am— Always! I did not cheat them in the bargain. I never held it worth my pains to hide The bold all-grasping habit of my soul. Countess. Nay rather—thou hast ever shewn thyself A formidable man, without restraint; Hast exercised the full prerogatives Of thy impetuous nature, which had been Once granted to thee. Therefore, Duke, not thou, Who hast still remained consistent with thyself, But they are in the wrong, who fearing thee, Entrusted such a power in hands they feared. For, by the laws of Spirit, in the right Is every individual character That acts in strict consistence with itself. Self-contradiction is the only wrong. Wert thou another being, then, when thou Eight years ago pursuedst thy march with fire And sword, and desolation, through the Circles Of Germany, the universal scourge, Didst mock all ordinances of the empire, The fearful rights of strength alone exertedst, Trampledst to earth each rank, each magistracy, All to extend thy Sultan's domination? Then was the time to break thee in, to curb Thy haughty will, to teach thee ordinance. But no! the Emperor felt no touch of conscience, What served him pleased him, and without a murmur He stamped his broad seal on these lawless deeds. What at that time was right, because thou didst it For him, to-day is all at once become Opprobrious, foul, because it is directed Against him.—O most flimsy superstition! Wallenstein (rising). I never saw it in this light before. 'Tis even so. The Emperor perpetrated Deeds through my arm, deeds most unorderly. And even this prince's mantle, which I wear, I owe to what were services to him, But most high misdemeanours 'gainst the empire. Countess. Then betwixt thee and him (confess it, Friedland!) The point can be no more of right and duty, Only of power and opportunity. That opportunity, lo! it comes yonder, Approaching with swift steeds; then with a swing Throw thyself up into the chariot-seat, Seize with firm hand the reins, ere thy opponent Anticipate thee, and himself make conquest Of the now empty seat. The moment comes— It is already here, when thou must write The absolute total of thy life's vast sum. The constellations stand victorious o'er thee, The planets shoot good fortune in fair junctions, And tell thee, ‘Now's the time!’ The starry courses Hast thou thy life long measured to no purpose? The quadrant and the circle, were they playthings? [Pointing to the different objects in the room. The zodiacs, the rolling orbs of heaven, Hast pictured on these walls, and all around thee In dumb, foreboding symbols hast thou placed These seven presiding Lords of Destiny— For toys? Is all this preparation nothing? Is there no marrow in this hollow art, That even to thyself it doth avail Nothing, and has no influence over thee In the great moment of decision?— Wallenstein (interrupting the Countess). Send Wrangel to me—I will instantly Dispatch three couriers— Illo (hurrying out). God in heaven be praised! Wallenstein. It is his evil genius and mine. Our evil genius! It chastises him Through me, the instrument of his ambition; And I expect no less, than that Revenge E'en now is whetting for my breast the poniard. Who sows the serpent's teeth, let him not hope To reap a joyous harvest. Every crime Has, in the moment of its perpetration, Its own avenging angel—dark misgiving, An ominous sinking at the inmost heart. He can no longer trust me—Then no longer Can I retreat—so come that which must come.— Still destiny preserves its due relations, The heart within us is its absolute Vicegerent. [To Tertsky. Go, conduct you Gustave Wrangel To my state-cabinet.—Myself will speak to The couriers.—And dispatch immediately A servant for Octavio Piccolomini. [To the Countess. No exultation—woman, triumph not! For jealous are the Powers of Destiny. Joy premature, and shouts ere victory, Incroach upon their rights and privileges. We sow the seed, and they the growth determine. [While he is making his exit the curtain drops. ACT V Scene I Scene—As in the preceding Act. Wallenstein, Octavio Piccolomini. Wallenstein (coming forward in conversation). He sends me word from Linz, that he lies sick; But I have sure intelligence, that he Secretes himself at Frauenberg with Galas. Secure them both, and send them to me hither. Remember, thou tak'st on thee the command Of those same Spanish regiments,—constantly Make preparation, and be never ready; And if they urge thee to draw out against me, Still answer yes, and stand as thou wert fettered. I know, that it is doing thee a service To keep thee out of action in this business. Thou lovest to linger on in fair appearances; Steps of extremity are not thy province, Therefore have I sought out this part for thee. Thou wilt this time be of most service to me By thy inertness. The mean time, if fortune Declare itself on my side, thou wilt know What is to do. Enter Max Piccolomini. Now go, Octavio. This night must thou be off, take my own horses: Him here I keep with me—make short farewell— Trust me, I think we all shall meet again In joy and thriving fortunes. Octavio (to his son). I shall see you Yet ere I go. Scene II Wallenstein, Max Piccolomini. Max (advances to him). My General! Wallenstein. That am I no longer, if Thou styl'st thyself the Emperor's officer. Max. Then thou wilt leave the army, General? Wallenstein. I have renounced the service of the Emperor. Max. And thou wilt leave the army? Wallenstein. Rather hope I To bind it nearer still and faster to me. [He seats himself. Yes, Max, I have delayed to open it to thee, Even till the hour of acting 'gins to strike. Youth's fortunate feeling doth seize easily The absolute right, yea, and a joy it is To exercise the single apprehension Where the sums square in proof; But where it happens, that of two sure evils One must be taken, where the heart not wholly Brings itself back from out the strife of duties, There 'tis a blessing to have no election, And blank necessity is grace and favour. —This is now present: do not look behind thee,— It can no more avail thee. Look thou forwards! Think not! judge not! prepare thyself to act! The Court—it hath determined on my ruin, Therefore I will to be beforehand with them. We'll join the Swedes—right gallant fellows are they, And our good friends. [He stops himself, expecting Piccolomini's answer. I have ta'en thee by surprise. Answer me not. I grant thee time to recollect thyself. [He rises, and retires at the back of the stage. Max remains for a long time motionless, in a trance of excessive anguish. At his first motion Wallenstein returns, and places himself before him. Max. My General, this day thou makest me Of age to speak in my own right and person, For till this day I have been spared the trouble To find out my own road. Thee have I followed With most implicit unconditional faith, Sure of the right path if I followed thee. To-day, for the first time, dost thou refer Me to myself, and forcest me to make Election between thee and my own heart. Wallenstein. Soft cradled thee thy Fortune till to-day; Thy duties thou couldst exercise in sport, Indulge all lovely instincts, act for ever With undivided heart. It can remain No longer thus. Like enemies, the roads Start from each other. Duties strive with duties. Thou must needs choose thy party in the war Which is now kindling 'twixt thy friend and him Who is thy Emperor. Max. War! is that the name? War is as frightful as heaven's pestilence. Yet it is good, is it heaven's will as that is. Is that a good war, which against the Emperor Thou wagest with the Emperor's own army? O God of heaven! what a change is this. Beseems it me to offer such persuasion To thee, who like the fixed star of the pole Wert all I gazed at on life's trackless ocean? O! what a rent thou makest in my heart! The ingrained instinct of old reverence, The holy habit of obediency, Must I pluck live asunder from thy name? Nay, do not turn thy countenance upon me— It always was as a god looking at me! Duke Wallenstein, its power is not departed: The senses still are in thy bonds, although, Bleeding, the soul hath freed itself. Wallenstein. Max, hear me. Max. O! do it not, I pray thee, do it not! There is a pure and noble soul within thee, Knows not of this unblest, unlucky doing. Thy will is chaste, it is thy fancy only Which hath polluted thee—and innocence, It will not let itself be driven away From that world-awing aspect. Thou wilt not, Thou canst not, end in this. It would reduce All human creatures to disloyalty Against the nobleness of their own nature. 'Twill justify the vulgar misbelief, Which holdeth nothing noble in free will, And trusts itself to impotence alone Made powerful only in an unknown power. Wallenstein. The world will judge me sternly, I expect it. Already have I said to my own self All thou canst say to me. Who but avoids The extreme,—can he by going round avoid it? But here there is no choice. Yes—I must use Or suffer violence—so stands the case, There remains nothing possible but that. Max. O that is never possible for thee! 'Tis the last desperate resource of those Cheap souls, to whom their honour, their good name Is their poor saving, their last worthless keep, Which having staked and lost, they stake themselves In the mad rage of gaming. Thou art rich, And glorious; with an unpolluted heart Thou canst make conquest of whate'er seems highest! But he, who once hath acted infamy, Does nothing more in this world. Wallenstein (grasps his hand). Calmly, Max! Much that is great and excellent will we Perform together yet. And if we only Stand on the height with dignity, 'tis soon Forgotten, Max, by what road we ascended. Believe me, many a crown shines spotless now, That yet was deeply sullied in the winning. To the evil spirit doth the earth belong, Not to the good. All, that the powers divine Send from above, are universal blessings: Their light rejoices us, their air refreshes, But never yet was man enriched by them: In their eternal realm no property Is to be struggled for—all there is general. The jewel, the all-valued gold we win From the deceiving Powers, depraved in nature, That dwell beneath the day and blessed sun-light. Not without sacrifices are they rendered Propitious, and there lives no soul on earth That e'er retired unsullied from their service. Max. Whate'er is human, to the human being Do I allow—and to the vehement And striving spirit readily I pardon The excess of action; but to thee, my General! Above all others make I large concession. For thou must move a world, and be the master— He kills thee, who condemns thee to inaction. So be it then! maintain thee in thy post By violence. Resist the Emperor, And if it must be, force with force repel: I will not praise it, yet I can forgive it. But not—not to the traitor—yes!—the word Is spoken out— Not to the traitor can I yield a pardon. That is no mere excess! that is no error Of human nature—that is wholly different, O that is black, black as the pit of hell! Thou canst not hear it nam'd, and wilt thou do it? O turn back to thy duty. That thou canst, I hold it certain. Send me to Vienna. I'll make thy peace for thee with the Emperor. He knows thee not. But I do know thee. He Shall see thee, Duke! with my unclouded eye, And I bring back his confidence to thee. Wallenstein. It is too late. Thou knowest not what has happened. Max. Were it too late, and were things gone so far, That a crime only could prevent thy fall, Then—fall! fall honourably, even as thou stood'st. Lose the command. Go from the stage of war. Thou canst with splendour do it—do it too With innocence. Thou hast liv'd much for others, At length live thou for thy own self. I follow thee. My destiny I never part from thine. Wallenstein. It is too late! Even now, while thou art losing Thy words, one after the other are the mile-stones Left fast behind by my post couriers, Who bear the order on to Prague and Egra. Yield thyself to it. We act as we are forced. I cannot give assent to my own shame And ruin. Thou—no—thou canst not forsake me! So let us do, what must be done, with dignity, With a firm step. What am I doing worse Than did famed Cæsar at the Rubicon, When he the legions led against his country, The which his country had delivered to him? Had he thrown down the sword, he had been lost, As I were, if I but disarmed myself. I trace out something in me of his spirit. Give me his luck, that other thing I'll bear. [Max quits him abruptly. Wallenstein, startled and overpowered, continues looking after him, and is still in this posture when Tertsky enters. Scene III Wallenstein, Tertsky. Tertsky. Max Piccolomini just left you? Wallenstein. Where is Wrangel? Tertsky. He is already gone. Wallenstein. In such a hurry? Tertsky. It is as if the earth had swallowed him. He had scarce left thee, when I went to seek him. I wished some words with him—but he was gone. How, when, and where, could no one tell me. Nay, I half believe it was the devil himself; A human creature could not so at once Have vanished. Illo (enters). Is it true that thou wilt send Octavio? Tertsky. How, Octavio! Whither send him? Wallenstein. He goes to Frauenberg, and will lead hither The Spanish and Italian regiments. Illo. No! Nay, Heaven forbid! Wallenstein. And why should Heaven forbid? Illo. Him!—that deceiver! Would'st thou trust to him The soldiery? Him wilt thou let slip from thee, Now, in the very instant that decides us— Tertsky. Thou wilt not do this!—No! I pray thee, no! Wallenstein. Ye are whimsical. Illo. O but for this time, Duke, Yield to our warning! Let him not depart. Wallenstein. And why should I not trust him only this time, Who have always trusted him? What, then, has happened, That I should lose my good opinion of him? In complaisance to your whims, not my own, I must, forsooth, give up a rooted judgment. Think not I am a woman. Having trusted him E'en till to-day, to-day too will I trust him. Tertsky. Must it be he—he only? Send another. Wallenstein. It must be he, whom I myself have chosen; He is well fitted for the business. Therefore I gave it him. Illo. Because he's an Italian— Therefore is he well fitted for the business. Wallenstein. I know you love them not—nor sire nor son— Because that I esteem them, love them—visibly Esteem them, love them more than you and others, E'en as they merit. Therefore are they eye-blights, Thorns in your foot-path. But your jealousies, In what affect they me or my concerns? Are they the worse to me because you hate them? Love or hate one another as you will, I leave to each man his own moods and likings; Yet know the worth of each of you to me. Illo. Von Questenberg, while he was here, was always Lurking about with this Octavio. Wallenstein. It happened with my knowledge and permission. Illo. I know that secret messengers came to him From Galas— Wallenstein. That's not true. Illo. O thou art blind With thy deep-seeing eyes. Wallenstein. Thou wilt not shake My faith for me—my faith, which founds itself On the profoundest science. If 'tis false, Then the whole science of the stars is false. For know, I have a pledge from fate itself, That he is the most faithful of my friends. Illo. Hast thou a pledge, that this pledge is not false? Wallenstein. There exist moments in the life of man, When he is nearer the great soul of the world Than is man's custom, and possesses freely The power of questioning his destiny: And such a moment 'twas, when in the night Before the action in the plains of Lützen, Leaning against a tree, thoughts crowding thoughts, I looked out far upon the ominous plain. My whole life, past and future, in this moment Before my mind's eye glided in procession, And to the destiny of the next morning The spirit, filled with anxious presentiment, Did knit the most removed futurity. Then said I also to myself, ‘So many Dost thou command. They follow all thy stars, And as on some great number set their All Upon thy single head, and only man The vessel of thy fortune. Yet a day Will come, when destiny shall once more scatter All these in many a several direction: Few be they who will stand out faithful to thee.’ I yearn'd to know which one was faithfullest Of all, this camp included. Great Destiny, Give me a sign! And he shall be the man, Who, on the approaching morning, comes the first To meet me with a token of his love: And thinking this, I fell into a slumber. Then midmost in the battle was I led In spirit. Great the pressure and the tumult! Then was my horse killed under me: I sank: And over me away, all unconcernedly, Drove horse and rider—and thus trod to pieces I lay, and panted like a dying man. Then seized me suddenly a saviour arm; It was Octavio's—I awoke at once, 'Twas broad day, and Octavio stood before me. ‘My brother,’ said he, ‘do not ride to-day The dapple, as you're wont; but mount the horse Which I have chosen for thee. Do it, brother! In love to me. A strong dream warned me so.’ It was the swiftness of this horse that snatched me From the hot pursuit of Bannier's dragoons. My cousin rode the dapple on that day, And never more saw I or horse or rider. Illo. That was a chance. Wallenstein. There's no such thing as chance. In brief, 'tis signed and sealed that this Octavio Is my good angel—and now no word more. [He is retiring. Tertsky. This is my comfort—Max remains our hostage. Illo. And he shall never stir from here alive. Wallenstein (stops and turns himself round). Are ye not like the women, who for ever Only recur to their first word, although One had been talking reason by the hour? Know, that the human being's thoughts and deeds Are not, like ocean billows, blindly moved. The inner world, his microcosmus, is The deep shaft, out of which they spring eternally. They grow by certain laws, like the tree's fruit— No juggling chance can metamorphose them. Have I the human kernel first examined? Then I know, too, the future will and action. Scene IV Scene—A Chamber in Piccolomini's Dwelling-House. Octavio Piccolomini, Isolani (entering). Isolani. Here am I—Well! who comes yet of the others? Octavio. But, first, a word with you, Count Isolani. Isolani. Will it explode, ha?—Is the Duke about To make the attempt? In me, friend, you may place Full confidence.—Nay, put me to the proof. Octavio. That may happen. Isolani. Noble brother, I am Not one of those men who in words are valiant, And when it comes to action skulk away. The Duke has acted towards me as a friend. God knows it is so; and I owe him all— He may rely on my fidelity. Octavio. That will be seen hereafter. Isolani. Be on your guard, All think not as I think; and there are many Who still hold with the Court—yes, and they say That those stolen signatures bind them to nothing. Octavio. I am rejoiced to hear it. Isolani. You rejoice! Octavio. That the Emperor has yet such gallant servants And loving friends. Isolani. Nay, jeer not, I entreat you. They are no such worthless fellows, I assure you. Octavio. I am assured already. God forbid That I should jest!—In very serious earnest I am rejoiced to see an honest cause So strong. Isolani. The Devil!—what!—why, what means this? Are you not, then—For what, then, am I here? Octavio. That you may make full declaration, whether You will be called the friend or enemy Of the Emperor. Isolani. That declaration, friend, I'll make to him in whom a right is placed To put that question to me. Octavio. Whether, Count, That right is mine, this paper may instruct you. Isolani. Why,—why—what! This is the Emperor's hand and seal! [Reads. ‘Whereas the officers collectively Throughout our army will obey the orders Of the Lieutenant-General Piccolomini As from ourselves.’—Hem!—Yes! so!—Yes! yes!— I—I give you joy, Lieutenant-General! Octavio. And you submit you to the order? Isolani. I— But you have taken me so by surprise— Time for reflection one must have— Octavio. Two minutes. Isolani. My God! But then the case is— Octavio. Plain and simple. You must declare you, whether you determine To act a treason 'gainst your Lord and Sovereign, Or whether you will serve him faithfully. Isolani. Treason!—My God!—But who talks then of treason? Octavio. That is the case. The Prince-Duke is a traitor— Means to lead over to the enemy The Emperor's army.—Now, Count!—brief and full— Say, will you break your oath to the Emperor? Sell yourself to the enemy?—Say, will you? Isolani. What mean you? I—I break my oath, d'ye say, To his Imperial Majesty? Did I say so?—When, when have I said that? Octavio. You have not said it yet—not yet. This instant I wait to hear, Count, whether you will say it. Isolani. Aye! that delights me now, that you yourself Bear witness for me that I never said so. Octavio. And you renounce the Duke then? Isolani. If he's planning Treason—why, treason breaks all bonds asunder. Octavio. And are determined, too, to fight against him? Isolani. He has done me service—but if he's a villain, Perdition seize him!—All scores are rubbed off. Octavio. I am rejoiced that you're so well disposed. This night break off in the utmost secrecy With all the light-armed troops—it must appear As came the order from the Duke himself. At Frauenberg's the place of rendezvous; There will Count Galas give you further orders. Isolani. It shall be done. But you'll remember me With the Emperor—how well disposed you found me. Octavio. I will not fail to mention it honourably. [Exit Isolani. A Servant enters. What, Colonel Butler!—Shew him up. Isolani (returning). Forgive me too my bearish ways, old father! Lord God! how should I know, then, what a great Person I had before me. Octavio. No excuses! Isolani. I am a merry lad, and if at time A rash word might escape me 'gainst the court Amidst my wine—You know no harm was meant. [Exit. Octavio. You need not be uneasy on that score. That has succeeded. Fortune favour us With all the others only but as much! Scene V Octavio Piccolomini, Butler. Butler. At your command, Lieutenant-General. Octavio. Welcome, as honoured friend and visitor. Butler. You do me too much honour. Octavio (after both have seated themselves). You have not Returned the advances which I made you yesterday— Misunderstood them, as mere empty forms. That wish proceeded from my heart—I was In earnest with you—for 'tis now a time In which the honest should unite most closely. Butler. 'Tis only the like-minded can unite. Octavio. True! and I name all honest men like-minded. I never charge a man but with those acts To which his character deliberately Impels him; for alas! the violence Of blind misunderstandings often thrusts The very best of us from the right track. You came through Frauenberg. Did the Count Galas Say nothing to you? Tell me. He's my friend. Butler. His words were lost on me. Octavio. It grieves me sorely To hear it: for his counsel was most wise. I had myself the like to offer. Butler. Spare Yourself the trouble—me th' embarrassment, To have deserved so ill your good opinion. Octavio. The time is precious—let us talk openly. You know how matters stand here. Wallenstein Meditates treason—I can tell you further— He has committed treason; but few hours Have past, since he a covenant concluded With the enemy. The messengers are now Full on their way to Egra and to Prague. To-morrow he intends to lead us over To the enemy. But he deceives himself; For prudence wakes—the Emperor has still Many and faithful friends here, and they stand In closest union, mighty though unseen. This manifesto sentences the Duke— Recalls the obedience of the army from him, And summons all the loyal, all the honest, To join and recognize in me their leader. Choose—will you share with us an honest cause? Or with the evil share an evil lot? Butler (rises). His lot is mine. Octavio. Is that your last resolve? Butler. It is. Octavio. Nay, but bethink you, Colonel Butler! As yet you have time. Within my faithful breast That rashly uttered word remains interred. Recall it, Butler! choose a better party: You have not chosen the right one. Butler (going). Any other Commands for me, Lieutenant-General? Octavio. See your white hairs! Recall that word! Butler. Farewell! Octavio. What, would you draw this good and gallant sword In such a cause? Into a curse would you Transform the gratitude which you have earned By forty years' fidelity from Austria? Butler (laughing with bitterness). Gratitude from the House of Austria. [He is going. Octavio (permits him to go as far as the door, then calls after him). Butler! Butler. What wish you? Octavio. How was't with the Count? Butler. Count? what? Octavio. The title that you wished, I mean. Butler (starts in sudden passion). Hell and damnation! Octavio. You petitioned for it— And your petition was repelled—Was it so? Butler. Your insolent scoff shall not go by unpunished. Draw! Octavio. Nay! your sword to 'ts sheath! and tell me calmly, How all that happened. I will not refuse you Your satisfaction afterwards.—Calmly, Butler! Butler. Be the whole world acquainted with the weakness For which I never can forgive myself. Lieutenant-General! Yes—I have ambition. Ne'er was I able to endure contempt. It stung me to the quick, that birth and title Should have more weight than merit has in the army. I would fain not be meaner than my equal, So in an evil hour I let myself Be tempted to that measure—It was folly! But yet so hard a penance it deserved not. It might have been refused; but wherefore barb And venom the refusal with contempt? Why dash to earth and crush with heaviest scorn The grey-haired man, the faithful veteran? Why to the baseness of his parentage Refer him with such cruel roughness, only Because he had a weak hour and forgot himself? But nature gives a sting e'en to the worm Which wanton power treads on in sport and insult. Octavio. You must have been calumniated. Guess you The enemy, who did you this ill service? Butler. Be't who it will—a most low-hearted scoundrel, Some vile court-minion must it be, some Spaniard, Some young squire of some ancient family, In whose light I may stand, some envious knave, Stung to his soul by my fair self-earned honours! Octavio. But tell me! Did the Duke approve that measure? Butler. Himself impelled me to it, used his interest In my behalf with all the warmth of friendship. Octavio. Ay? Are you sure of that? Butler. I read the letter. Octavio. And so did I—but the contents were different. By chance I'm in possession of that letter— Can leave it to your own eyes to convince you. [He gives him the letter. Butler. Ha! what is this? Octavio. I fear me, Colonel Butler, An infamous game have they been playing with you. The Duke, you say, impelled you to this measure? Now, in this letter talks he in contempt Concerning you, counsels the Minister To give sound chastisement to your conceit, For so he calls it. [Butler reads through the letter, his knees tremble, he seizes a chair, and sinks down in it. You have no enemy, no persecutor; There's no one wishes ill to you. Ascribe The insult you received to the Duke only. His aim is clear and palpable. He wished To tear you from your Emperor—he hoped To gain from your revenge what he well knew (What your long-tried fidelity convinced him) He ne'er could dare expect from your calm reason. A blind tool would he make you, in contempt Use you, as means of most abandoned ends. He has gained his point. Too well has he succeeded In luring you away from that good path On which you had been journeying forty years! Butler. Can e'er the Emperor's Majesty forgive me? Octavio. More than forgive you. He would fain compensate For that affront, and most unmerited grievance Sustained by a deserving, gallant veteran. From his free impulse he confirms the present, Which the Duke made you for a wicked purpose. The regiment, which you now command, is yours. [Butler attempts to rise, sinks down again. He labours inwardly with violent emotions; tries to speak, and cannot. At length he takes his sword from the belt, and offers it to Piccolomini. Octavio. What wish you? Recollect yourself, friend. Butler. Take it. Octavio. But to what purpose? Calm yourself. Butler. O take it! I am no longer worthy of this sword. Octavio. Receive it then anew from my hands—and Wear it with honour for the right cause ever. Butler. —Perjure myself to such a gracious Sovereign! Octavio. You'll make amends. Quick! break off from the Duke! Butler. Break off from him! Octavio. What now? Bethink thyself. Butler (no longer governing his emotion). Only break off from him?—He dies!—he dies! Octavio. Come after me to Frauenberg, where now All who are loyal are assembling under Counts Altringer and Galas. Many others I've brought to a remembrance of their duty. This night be sure that you escape from Pilsen. Butler. Count Piccolomini! Dare that man speak Of honour to you, who once broke his troth? Octavio. He, who repents so deeply of it, dares. Butler. Then leave me here, upon my word of honour! Octavio. What's your design? Butler. Leave me and my regiment. Octavio. I have full confidence in you. But tell me What are you brooding? Butler. That the deed will tell you. Ask me no more at present. Trust to me. Ye may trust safely. By the living God Ye give him over, not to his good angel! Farewell. [Exit Butler. Servant (enters with a billet). A stranger left it, and is gone. The Prince-Duke's horses wait for you below. [Exit Servant. Octavio (reads). ‘Be sure, make haste! Your faithful Isolan.’ —O that I had but left this town behind me. To split upon a rock so near the haven!— Away! This is no longer a safe place for me! Where can my son be tarrying? Scene VI Octavio and Max Piccolomini. Octavio (advances to Max). I am going off, my son. [Receiving no answer he takes his hand. My son, farewell. Max. Farewell. Octavio. Thou wilt soon follow me? Max. I follow thee? Thy way is crooked—it is not my way. [Octavio drops his hand, and starts back. O, hadst thou been but simple and sincere, Ne'er had it come to this—all had stood otherwise. He had not done that foul and horrible deed, The virtuous had retained their influence o'er him: He had not fallen into the snares of villains. Wherefore so like a thief, and thief's accomplice Did'st creep behind him—lurking for thy prey? O, unblest falsehood! Mother of all evil! Thou misery-making demon, it is thou That sink'st us in perdition. Simple truth, Sustainer of the world, had saved us all! Father, I will not, I cannot excuse thee! Wallenstein has deceived me—O, most foully! But thou hast acted not much better. Octavio. Son! My son, ah! I forgive thy agony! Max. Was't possible? had'st thou the heart, my father, Had'st thou the heart to drive it to such lengths, With cold premeditated purpose? Thou— Had'st thou the heart, to wish to see him guilty. Rather than saved? Thou risest by his fall. Octavio, 'twill not please me. Octavio. God in Heaven! Max. O, woe is me! sure I have changed my nature. How comes suspicion here—in the free soul? Hope, confidence, belief, are gone; for all Lied to me, all what I e'er loved or honoured. No! No! Not all! She—she yet lives for me, And she is true, and open as the Heavens! Deceit is every where, hypocrisy, Murder, and poisoning, treason, perjury: The single holy spot is now our love, The only unprofaned in human nature. Octavio. Max!—we will go together. 'Twill be better. Max. What? ere I've taken a last parting leave, The very last—no never! Octavio. Spare thyself The pang of necessary separation. Come with me! Come, my son! [Attempts to take him with him. Max. No! as sure as God lives, no! Octavio. Come with me, I command thee! I, thy father. Max. Command me what is human. I stay here. Octavio. Max! in the Emperor's name I bid thee come. Max. No Emperor has power to prescribe Laws to the heart; and would'st thou wish to rob me Of the sole blessing which my fate has left me, Her sympathy? Must then a cruel deed Be done with cruelty? The unalterable Shall I perform ignobly—steal away, With stealthy coward flight forsake her? No! She shall behold my suffering, my sore anguish, Hear the complaints of the disparted soul, And weep tears o'er me. Oh! the human race Have steely souls—but she is as an angel. From the black deadly madness of despair Will she redeem my soul, and in soft words Of comfort, plaining, loose this pang of death! Octavio. Thou wilt not tear thyself away; thou canst not. O, come, my son! I bid thee save thy virtue. Max. Squander not thou thy words in vain. The heart I follow, for I dare trust to it. Octavio. Max! Max! if that most damnéd thing could be, If thou—my son—my own blood—(dare I think it?) Do sell thyself to him, the infamous, Do stamp this brand upon our noble house, Then shall the world behold the horrible deed, And in unnatural combat shall the steel Of the son trickle with the father's blood. Max. O hadst thou always better thought of men, Thou hadst then acted better. Curst suspicion! Unholy miserable doubt! To him Nothing on earth remains unwrenched and firm, Who has no faith. Octavio. And if I trust thy heart, Will it be always in thy power to follow it? Max. The heart's voice thou hast not o'erpower'd—as little Will Wallenstein be able to o'erpower it. Octavio. O, Max! I see thee never more again! Max. Unworthy of thee wilt thou never see me. Octavio. I go to Frauenberg—the Pappenheimers I leave thee here, the Lothrings too; Toskana And Tiefenbach remain here to protect thee. They love thee, and are faithful to their oath, And will far rather fall in gallant contest Than leave their rightful leader, and their honour. Max. Rely on this, I either leave my life In the struggle, or conduct them out of Pilsen. Octavio. Farewell, my son! Max. Farewell! Octavio. How? not one look Of filial love? No grasp of the hand at parting? It is a bloody war, to which we are going, And the event uncertain and in darkness. So used we not to part—it was not so! Is it then true? I have a son no longer? [Max falls into his arms, they hold each [other] for a long time in a speechless embrace, then go away at different sides. The Curtain drops. THE DEATH OF WALLENSTEIN A TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS PREFACE OF THE TRANSLATOR TO THE FIRST EDITION The two Dramas, Piccolomini, or the first part of Wallenstein, and Wallenstein, are introduced in the original manuscript by a Prelude in one Act, entitled Wallenstein's Camp. This is written in rhyme, and in nine-syllable verse, in the same lilting metre (if that expression may be permitted) with the second Eclogue of Spenser's Shepherd's Calendar. This Prelude possesses a sort of broad humour, and is not deficient in character; but to have translated it into prose, or into any other metre than that of the original, would have given a false notion both of its style and purport; to have translated it into the same metre would have been incompatible with a faithful adherence to the sense of the German, from the comparative poverty of our language in rhymes; and it would have been unadvisable from the incongruity of those lax verses with the present taste of the English Public. Schiller's intention seems to have been merely to have prepared his reader for the Tragedies by a lively picture of the laxity of discipline, and the mutinous dispositions of Wallenstein's soldiery. It is not necessary as a preliminary explanation. For these reasons it has been thought expedient not to translate it. The admirers of Schiller, who have abstracted their conception of that author from the Robbers, and the Cabal and Love, plays in which the main interest is produced by the excitement of curiosity, and in which the curiosity is excited by terrible and extraordinary incident, will not have perused without some portion of disappointment the Dramas, which it has been my employment to translate. They should, however, reflect that these are Historical Dramas, taken from a popular German History; that we must therefore judge of them in some measure with the feelings of Germans; or by analogy, with the interest excited in us by similar Dramas in our own language. Few, I trust, would be rash or ignorant enough to compare Schiller with Shakspeare yet, merely as illustration, I would say that we should proceed to the perusal of Wallenstein, not from Lear or Othello, but from Richard the Second, or the three parts of Henry the Sixth. We scarcely expect rapidity in an Historical Drama; and many prolix speeches are pardoned from characters, whose names and actions have formed the most amusing tales of our early life. On the other hand, there exist in these plays more individual beauties, more passages the excellence of which will bear reflection, than in the former productions of Schiller. The description of the Astrological Tower, and the reflections of the Young Lover, which follow it, form in the original a fine poem; and my translation must have been wretched indeed, if it can have wholly overclouded the beauties of the Scene in the first Act of the first Play between Questenberg, Max, and Octavio Piccolomini. If we except the Scene of the setting sun in the Robbers, I know of no part in Schiller's Plays which equals the whole of the first Scene of the fifth Act of the concluding Play. It would be unbecoming in me to be more diffuse on this subject. A Translator stands connected with the original Author by a certain law of subordination, which makes it more decorous to point out excellencies than defects: indeed he is not likely to be a fair judge of either. The pleasure or disgust from his own labour will mingle with the feelings that arise from an afterview of the original. Even in the first perusal of a work in any foreign language which we understand, we are apt to attribute to it more excellence than it really possesses from our own pleasurable sense of difficulty overcome without effect. Translation of poetry into poetry is difficult, because the Translator must give a brilliancy to his language without that warmth of original conception, from which such brilliancy would follow of its own accord. But the translator of a living Author is encumbered with additional inconveniences. If he render his original faithfully, as to the sense of each passage, he must necessarily destroy a considerable portion of the spirit; if he endeavour to give a work executed according to laws of compensation, he subjects himself to imputations of vanity, or misrepresentation. I have thought it my duty to remain bound by the sense of my original, with as few exceptions as the nature of the languages rendered possible.

ACT I Scene I Scene—A Chamber in the House of the Duchess of Friedland. Countess Tertsky, Thekla, Lady Neubrunn (the two latter sit at the same table at work). Countess (watching them from the opposite side). So you have nothing, niece, to ask me? Nothing? I have been waiting for a word from you. And could you then endure in all this time Not once to speak his name? [The Countess rises and advances to her. Why, how comes this? Perhaps I am already grown superfluous, And other ways exist, besides through me? Confess it to me, Thekla! have you seen him? Thekla. To-day and yesterday I have not seen him. Countess. And not heard from him either? Come, be open! Thekla. No syllable. Countess. And still you are so calm? Thekla. I am. Countess. May't please you, leave us, Lady Neubrunn! [Exit Lady Neubrunn. Scene II The Countess, Thekla. Countess. It does not please me, Princess! that he holds Himself so still, exactly at this time. Thekla. Exactly at this time? Countess. He now knows all. 'Twere now the moment to declare himself. Thekla. If I'm to understand you, speak less darkly. Countess. 'Twas for that purpose that I bade her leave us. Thekla, you are no more a child. Your heart Is now no more in nonage: for you love, And boldness dwells with love—that you have proved. Your nature moulds itself upon your father's More than your mother's spirit. Therefore may you Hear, what were too much for her fortitude. Thekla. Enough! no further preface, I entreat you. At once, out with it! Be it what it may, It is not possible that it should torture me More than this introduction. What have you To say to me? Tell me the whole and briefly! Countess. You'll not be frightened— Thekla. Name it, I entreat you. Countess. It lies within your power to do your father A weighty service— Thekla. Lies within my power? Countess. Max Piccolomini loves you. You can link him Indissolubly to your father. Thekla. I? What need of me for that? And is he not Already linked to him? Countess. He was. Thekla. And wherefore Should he not be so now—not be so always? Countess. He cleaves to the Emperor too. Thekla. Not more than duty And honour may demand of him. Countess. We ask Proofs of his love, and not proofs of his honour. Duty and honour! Those are ambiguous words with many meanings. You should interpret them for him: his love Should be the sole definer of his honour. Thekla. How? Countess. The Emperor or you must he renounce. Thekla. He will accompany my father gladly In his retirement. From himself you heard, How much he wished to lay aside the sword. Countess. He must not lay the sword aside, we mean; He must unsheath it in your father's cause. Thekla. He'll spend with gladness and alacrity His life, his heart's blood in my father's cause, If shame or injury be intended him. Countess. You will not understand me. Well, hear then! Your father has fallen off from the Emperor, And is about to join the enemy With the whole soldiery— Thekla. Alas, my mother! Countess. There needs a great example to draw on The army after him. The Piccolomini Possess the love and reverence of the troops; They govern all opinions, and wherever They lead the way, none hesitate to follow. The son secures the father to our interests— You've much in your hands at this moment. Thekla. Ah, My miserable mother! what a death-stroke Awaits thee!—No! She never will survive it. Countess. She will accommodate her soul to that Which is and must be. I do know your mother. The far-off future weights upon her heart With torture of anxiety; but is it Unalterably, actually present, She soon resigns herself, and bears it calmly. Thekla. O my fore-boding bosom! Even now, E'en now 'tis here, that icy hand of horror! And my young hope lies shuddering in its grasp; I knew it well—no sooner had I entered, A heavy ominous presentiment Revealed to me, that spirits of death were hovering Over my happy fortune. But why think I First of myself? My mother! O my mother! Countess. Calm yourself! Break not out in vain lamenting! Preserve you for your father the firm friend, And for yourself the lover, all will yet Prove good and fortunate. Thekla. Prove good? What good? Must we not part? Part ne'er to meet again? Countess. He parts not from you! He can not part from you. Thekla. Alas for his sore anguish! It will rend His heart asunder. Countess. If indeed he loves you, His resolution will be speedily taken. Thekla. His resolution will be speedily taken— O do not doubt of that! A resolution! Does there remain one to be taken? Countess. Hush! Collect yourself! I hear your mother coming. Thekla. How shall I bear to see her? Countess. Collect yourself. Scene III To them enter the Duchess. Duchess (to the Countess). Who was here, sister? I heard some one talking, And passionately too. Countess. Nay! There was no one. Duchess. I am grown so timorous, every trifling noise Scatters my spirits, and announces to me The footstep of some messenger of evil. And can you tell me, sister, what the event is? Will he agree to do the Emperor's pleasure, And send the horse-regiments to the Cardinal? Tell me, has he dismissed Von Questenberg With a favourable answer? Countess. No, he has not. Duchess. Alas! then all is lost! I see it coming, The worst that can come! Yes, they will depose him; The accurséd business of the Regenspurg diet Will all be acted o'er again! Countess. No! never! Make your heart easy, sister, as to that. [Thekla throws herself upon her mother, and enfolds her in her arms, weeping. Duchess. Yes, my poor child! Thou too hast lost a most affectionate godmother In the Empress. O that stern unbending man! In this unhappy marriage what have I Not suffered, not endured. For ev'n as if I had been linked on to some wheel of fire That restless, ceaseless, whirls impetuous onward, I have passed a life of frights and horrors with him, And ever to the brink of some abyss With dizzy headlong violence he whirls me. Nay, do not weep, my child! Let not my sufferings Presignify unhappiness to thee, Nor blacken with their shade the fate that waits thee. There lives no second Friedland: thou, my child, Hast not to fear thy mother's destiny. Thekla. O let us supplicate him, dearest mother! Quick! quick! here's no abiding-place for us. Here every coming hour broods into life Some new affrightful monster. Duchess. Thou wilt share An easier, calmer lot, my child! We too, I and thy father, witnessed happy days. Still think I with delight of those first years, When he was making progress with glad effort, When his ambition was a genial fire, Not that consuming flame which now it is. The Emperor loved him, trusted him: and all He undertook could not but be successful. But since that ill-starred day at Regenspurg, Which plunged him headlong from his dignity, A gloomy uncompanionable spirit, Unsteady and suspicious, has possessed him. His quiet mind forsook him, and no longer Did he yield up himself in joy and faith To his old luck, and individual power; But thenceforth turned his heart and best affections All to those cloudy sciences, which never Have yet made happy him who followed them. Countess. You see it, sister! as your eyes permit you. But surely this is not the conversation To pass the time in which we are waiting for him. You know he will be soon here. Would you have him Find her in this condition? Duchess. Come, my child! Come, wipe away thy tears, and shew thy father A cheerful countenance. See, the tie-knot here Is off—this hair must not hang so dishevelled. Come, dearest! dry thy tears up. They deform Thy gentle eye—well now—what was I saying? Yes, in good truth, this Piccolomini Is a most noble and deserving gentleman. Countess. That is he, sister! Thekla (to the Countess). Aunt, you will excuse me? [Is going. Countess. But whither? See, your father comes. Thekla. I cannot see him now. Countess. Nay, but bethink you. Thekla. Believe me, I cannot sustain his presence. Countess. But he will miss you, will ask after you. Duchess. What now? Why is she going? Countess. She's not well. Duchess. What ails then my beloved child? [Both follow the Princess, and endeavour to detain her. During this Wallenstein appears, engaged in conversation with Illo. Scene IV Wallenstein, Illo, Countess, Duchess, Thekla. Wallenstein. All quiet in the camp? Illo. It is all quiet. Wallenstein. In a few hours may couriers come from Prague With tidings, that this capital is ours. Then we may drop the mask, and to the troops Assembled in this town make known the measure And its result together. In such cases Example does the whole. Whoever is foremost Still leads the herd. An imitative creature Is man. The troops at Prague conceive no other, Than that the Pilsen army has gone through The forms of homage to us; and in Pilsen They shall swear fealty to us, because The example has been given them by Prague. Butler, you tell me, has declared himself. Illo. At his own bidding, unsolicited, He came to offer you himself and regiment. Wallenstein. I find we must not give implicit credence To every warning voice that makes itself Be listened to in the heart. To hold us back, Oft does the lying spirit counterfeit The voice of Truth and inward Revelation, Scattering false oracles. And thus have I To intreat forgiveness, for that secretly I've wrong'd this honourable gallant man, This Butler: for a feeling, of the which I am not master (fear I would not call it), Creeps o'er me instantly, with sense of shuddering, At his approach, and stops love's joyous motion. And this same man, against whom I am warned, This honest man is he, who reaches to me The first pledge of my fortune. Illo. And doubt not That his example will win over to you The best men in the army. Wallenstein. Go and send Isolani hither. Send him immediately. He is under recent obligations to me. With him will I commence the trial. Go. [Illo exit. Wallenstein (turns himself round to the females). Lo, there the mother with the darling daughter! For once we'll have an interval of rest— Come! my heart yearns to live a cloudless hour In the beloved circle of my family. Countess. 'Tis long since we've been thus together, brother. Wallenstein (to the Countess aside). Can she sustain the news? Is she prepared? Countess. Not yet. Wallenstein. Come here, my sweet girl! Seat thee by me, For there is a good spirit on thy lips. Thy mother praised to me thy ready skill: She says a voice of melody dwells in thee, Which doth enchant the soul. Now such a voice Will drive away from me the evil demon That beats his black wings close above my head. Duchess. Where is thy lute, my daughter? Let thy father Hear some small trial of thy skill. Thekla. My mother! I— Duchess. Trembling? Come, collect thyself. Go, cheer Thy father. Thekla. O my mother! I—I cannot. Countess. How, what is that, niece? Thekla (to the Countess). O spare me—sing—now—in this sore anxiety, Of the o'erburthen'd soul—to sing to him, Who is thrusting, even now, my mother headlong Into her grave! Duchess. How, Thekla? Humoursome? What! shall thy father have expressed a wish In vain? Countess. Here is the lute. Thekla. My God! how can I— [The orchestra plays. During the ritornello Thekla expresses in her gestures and countenance the struggle of her feelings: and at the moment that she should begin to sing, contracts herself together, as one shuddering, throws the instrument down, and retires abruptly. Duchess. My child! O she is ill— Wallenstein. What ails the maiden? Say, is she often so? Countess. Since then herself Has now betrayed it, I too must no longer Conceal it. Wallenstein. What? Countess. She loves him! Wallenstein. Loves him! Whom? Countess. Max does she love! Max Piccolomini. Hast thou ne'er noticed it? Nor yet my sister? Duchess. Was it this that lay so heavy on her heart? God's blessing on thee, my sweet child! Thou needest Never take shame upon thee for thy choice. Countess. This journey, if 'twere not thy aim, ascribe it To thine own self. Thou shouldest have chosen another To have attended her. Wallenstein. And does he know it? Countess. Yes, and he hopes to win her. Wallenstein. Hopes to win her! Is the boy mad? Countess. Well—hear it from themselves. Wallenstein. He thinks to carry off Duke Friedland's daughter! Aye?—The thought pleases me. The young man has no grovelling spirit. Countess. Since Such and such constant favour you have shewn him— Wallenstein. He chooses finally to be my heir. And true it is, I love the youth; yea, honour him. But must he therefore be my daughter's husband! Is it daughters only? Is it only children That we must shew our favour by? Duchess. His noble disposition and his manners— Wallenstein. Win him my heart, but not my daughter. Duchess. Then His rank, his ancestors— Wallenstein. Ancestors! What? He is a subject, and my son-in-law I will seek out upon the thrones of Europe. Duchess. O dearest Albrecht! Climb we not too high, Lest we should fall too low. Wallenstein. What? have I paid A price so heavy to ascend this eminence, And jut out high above the common herd, Only to close the mighty part I play In Life's great drama, with a common kinsman? Have I for this— [pause.] She is the only thing That will remain behind of me on earth; And I will see a crown around her head, Or die in the attempt to place it there. I hazard all—all! and for this alone, To lift her into greatness— Yea, in this moment, in the which we are speaking— [pause. And I must now, like a soft-hearted father, Couple together in good peasant fashion The pair, that chance to suit each other's liking— And I must do it now, even now, when I Am stretching out the wreath that is to twine My full accomplished work—no! she is the jewel, Which I have treasured long, my last, my noblest, And 'tis my purpose not to let her from me For less than a king's sceptre. Duchess. O my husband! You're ever building, building to the clouds, Still building higher, and still higher building, And ne'er reflect, that the poor narrow basis Cannot sustain the giddy tottering column. Wallenstein (to the Countess). Have you announced the place of residence Which I have destined for her? Countess. No! not yet. 'Twere better you yourself disclosed it to her. Duchess. How? Do we not return to Karn then? Wallenstein. No. Duchess. And to no other of your lands or seats? Wallenstein. You would not be secure there. Duchess. Not secure In the Emperor's realms, beneath the Emperor's Protection? Wallenstein. Friedland's wife may be permitted No longer to hope that. Duchess. O God in heaven! And have you brought it even to this? Wallenstein. In Holland You'll find protection. Duchess. In a Lutheran country? What? And you send us into Lutheran countries? Wallenstein. Duke Franz of Lauenburg conducts you thither. Duchess. Duke Franz of Lauenburg? The ally of Sweden, the Emperor's enemy. Wallenstein. The Emperor's enemies are mine no longer. Duchess (casting a look of terror on the Duke and the Countess). Is it then true? It is. You are degraded? Deposed from the command? O God in heaven! Countess (aside to the Duke). Leave her in this belief. Thou seest she cannot Support the real truth. Scene V To them enter Count Tertsky. Countess. —Tertsky! What ails him? What an image of affright! He looks as he had seen a ghost. Tertsky (leading Wallenstein aside). Is it thy command that all the Croats— Wallenstein. Mine! Tertsky. We are betrayed. Wallenstein. What? Tertsky. They are off! This night The Jägers likewise—all the villages In the whole round are empty. Wallenstein. Isolani? Tertsky. Him thou hast sent away. Yes, surely. Wallenstein. I? Tertsky. No! Hast thou not sent him off? Nor Deodate? They are vanished both of them. Scene VI To them enter Illo. Illo. Has Tertsky told thee? Tertsky. He knows all. Illo. And likewise That Esterhatzy, Goetz, Maradas, Kaunitz, Kolatto, Palfi, have forsaken thee? Tertsky. Damnation! Wallenstein (winks at them). Hush! Countess (who has been watching them anxiously from the distance and now advances to them). Tertsky! Heaven! What is it? What has happened? Wallenstein (scarcely suppressing his emotions). Nothing! let us be gone! Tertsky (following him). Theresa, it is nothing. Countess (holding him back). Nothing? Do I not see, that all the lifeblood Has left your cheeks—look you not like a ghost? That even my brother but affects a calmness? Page (enters). An Aid-de-Camp enquires for the Count Tertsky. [Tertsky follows the Page. Wallenstein. Go, hear his business. [To Illo. This could not have happened So unsuspected without mutiny. Who was on guard at the gates? Illo. 'Twas Tiefenbach. Wallenstein. Let Tiefenbach leave guard without delay, And Tertsky's grenadiers relieve him. [Illo is going. Stop! Hast thou heard aught of Butler? Illo. Him I met. He will be here himself immediately. Butler remains unshaken. [Illo exit. Wallenstein is following him. Countess. Let him not leave thee, sister! go, detain him! There's some misfortune. Duchess (clinging to him). Gracious heaven! What is it? Wallenstein. Be tranquil! leave me, sister! dearest wife! We are in camp, and this is nought unusual; Here storm and sunshine follow one another With rapid interchanges. These fierce spirits Champ the curb angrily, and never yet Did quiet bless the temples of the leader. If I am to stay, go you. The plaints of women Ill suit the scene where men must act. [He is going: Tertsky returns. Tertsky. Remain here. From this window must we see it. Wallenstein (to the Countess). Sister, retire! Countess. No—never. Wallenstein. 'Tis my will. Tertsky (leads the Countess aside, and drawing her attention to the Duchess). Theresa! Duchess. Sister, come! since he commands it. Scene VII Wallenstein, Tertsky. Wallenstein (stepping to the window). What now, then? Tertsky. There are strange movements among all the troops, And no one knows the cause. Mysteriously, With gloomy silentness, the several corps Marshal themselves, each under its own banners. Tiefenbach's corps makes threatening movements; only The Pappenheimers still remain aloof In their own quarters, and let no one enter. Wallenstein. Does Piccolomini appear among them? Tertsky. We are seeking him: he is no where to be met with. Wallenstein. What did the Aid-de-Camp deliver to you? Tertsky. My regiments had dispatched him; yet once more They swear fidelity to thee, and wait The shout for onset, all prepared, and eager. Wallenstein. But whence arose this larum in the camp? It should have been kept secret from the army, Till fortune had decided for us at Prague. Tertsky. O that thou hadst believed me! Yester evening Did we conjure thee not to let that skulker, That fox, Octavio, pass the gates of Pilsen. Thou gav'st him thy own horses to flee from thee. Wallenstein. The old tune still! Now, once for all, no more Of this suspicion—it is doting folly. Tertsky. Thou did'st confide in Isolani too; And lo! he was the first that did desert thee. Wallenstein. It was but yesterday I rescued him From abject wretchedness. Let that go by. I never reckon'd yet on gratitude. And wherein doth he wrong in going from me? He follows still the god whom all his life He has worshipped at the gaming table. With My Fortune, and my seeming destiny, He made the bond, and broke it not with me. I am but the ship in which his hopes were stowed, And with the which well-pleased and confident He traversed the open sea; now he beholds it In imminent jeopardy among the coast-rocks, And hurries to preserve his wares. As light As the free bird from the hospitable twig Where it had nested, he flies off from me: No human tie is snapped betwixt us two. Yea, he deserves to find himself deceived, Who seeks a heart in the unthinking man. Like shadows on a stream, the forms of life Impress their characters on the smooth forehead, Nought sinks into the bosom's silent depth: Quick sensibility of pain and pleasure Moves the light fluids lightly; but no soul Warmeth the inner frame. Tertsky. Yet, would I rather Trust the smooth brow than that deep furrowed one. Scene VIII Wallenstein, Tertsky, Illo. Illo. Treason and mutiny! Tertsky. And what further now? Illo. Tiefenbach's soldiers, when I gave the orders To go off guard—Mutinous villains! Tertsky. Well! Wallenstein. What followed? Illo. They refused obedience to them. Tertsky. Fire on them instantly! Give out the order. Wallenstein. Gently! what cause did they assign? Illo. No other, They said, had right to issue orders but Lieutenant-General Piccolomini. Wallenstein. What? How is that? Illo. He takes that office on him by commission, Under sign-manual of the Emperor. Tertsky. From the Emperor—hear'st thou, Duke? Illo. At his incitement The Generals made that stealthy flight— Tertsky. Duke! hearest thou? Illo. Caraffa too, and Montecuculi, Are missing, with six other Generals, All whom he had induced to follow him. This plot he has long had in writing by him From the Emperor; but 'twas finally concluded With all the detail of the operation Some days ago with the Envoy Questenberg. [Wallenstein sinks down into a chair and covers his face. Tertsky. O hadst thou but believed me! Scene IX To them enter the Countess. Countess. This suspense, This horrid fear—I can no longer bear it. For heaven's sake, tell me, what has taken place. Illo. The regiments are all falling off from us. Tertsky. Octavio Piccolomini is a traitor. Countess. O my foreboding! [Rushes out of the room. Tertsky. Hadst thou but believed me! Now seest thou how the stars have lied to thee. Wallenstein. The stars lie not; but we have here a work Wrought counter to the stars and destiny. The science is still honest: this false heart Forces a lie on the truth-telling heaven. On a divine law divination rests; Where nature deviates from that law, and stumbles Out of her limits, there all science errs. True, I did not suspect! Were it superstition Never by such suspicion t' have affronted The human form, O may that time ne'er come In which I shame me of the infirmity. The wildest savage drinks not with the victim Into whose breast he means to plunge the sword. This, this, Octavio, was no hero's deed: 'Twas not thy prudence that did conquer mine; A bad heart triumphed o'er an honest one. No shield received the assassin stroke; thou plungest Thy weapon on an unprotected breast— Against such weapons I am but a child. Scene X To these enter Butler. Tertsky (meeting him). O look there! Butler! Here we've still a friend! Wallenstein (meets him with outspread arms, and embraces him with warmth). Come to my heart, old comrade! Not the sun Looks out upon us more revivingly In the earliest month of spring, Than a friend's countenance in such an hour. Butler. My General: I come— Wallenstein (leaning on Butler's shoulders). Know'st thou already? That old man has betrayed me to the Emperor. What say'st thou? Thirty years have we together Lived out, and held out, sharing joy and hardship. We have slept in one camp-bed, drunk from one glass, One morsel shared! I leaned myself on him, As now I lean me on thy faithful shoulder. And now in the very moment, when, all love, All confidence, my bosom beat to his, He sees and takes the advantage, stabs the knife Slowly into my heart. [He hides his face on Butler's breast. Butler. Forget the false one. What is your present purpose? Wallenstein. Well remembered! Courage my soul! I am still rich in friends, Still loved by Destiny; for in the moment, That it unmasks the plotting hypocrite, It sends and proves to me one faithful heart. Of the hypocrite no more! Think not, his loss Was that which struck the pang: O no! his treason Is that which strikes this pang! No more of him! Dear to my heart, and honoured were they both, And the young man—yes—he did truly love me, He—he—has not deceived me. But enough, Enough of this—Swift counsel now beseems us. The Courier, whom Count Kinsky sent from Prague I expect him every moment: and whatever He may bring with him, we must take good care To keep it from the mutineers. Quick, then! Dispatch some messenger you can rely on To meet him, and conduct him to me. [Illo is going. Butler (detaining him). My General, whom expect you then? Wallenstein. The Courier Who brings me word of the event at Prague. Butler (hesitating). Hem! Wallenstein. And what now? Butler. You do not know it? Wallenstein. Well? Butler. From what that larum in the camp arose? Wallenstein. From what? Butler. That Courier. Wallenstein. Well? Butler. Is already here. Tertsky and Illo (at the same time). Already here? Wallenstein. My Courier? Butler. For some hours. Wallenstein. And I not know it? Butler. The centinels detain him In custody. Illo. Damnation! Butler. And his letter Was broken open, and is circulated Through the whole camp. Wallenstein. You know what it contains? Butler. Question me not. Tertsky. Illo! alas for us. Wallenstein. Hide nothing from me—I can hear the worst. Prague then is lost. It is. Confess it freely. Butler. Yes! Prague is lost. And all the several regiments At Budweiss, Tabor, Brannau, Konigingratz, At Brun and Znaym, have forsaken you, And ta'en the oaths of fealty anew To the Emperor. Yourself, with Kinsky, Tertsky, And Illo have been sentenced. [Tertsky and Illo express alarm and fury. Wallenstein remains firm and collected. Wallenstein. 'Tis decided! 'Tis well! I have received a sudden cure From all the pangs of doubt: with steady stream Once more my life-blood flows! My soul's secure! In the night only Friedland's stars can beam. Lingering irresolute, with fitful fears I drew the sword—'twas with an inward strife, While yet the choice was mine. The murderous knife Is lifted for my heart! Doubt disappears! I fight now for my head and for my life. [Exit Wallenstein; the others follow him. Scene XI Countess Tertsky (enters from a side room). I can endure no longer. No! [Looks around her. Where are they? No one is here. They leave me all alone, Alone in this sore anguish of suspense. And I must wear the outward shew of calmness Before my sister, and shut in within me The pangs and agonies of my crowded bosom. It is not to be borne.—If all should fail; If—if he must go over to the Swedes, An empty-handed fugitive, and not As an ally, a covenanted equal, A proud commander with his army following; If we must wander on from land to land, Like the Count Palatine, of fallen greatness An ignominious monument—But no! That day I will not see! And could himself Endure to sink so low, I would not bear To see him so low sunken. Scene XII Countess, Duchess, Thekla. Thekla (endeavouring to hold back the Duchess). Dear mother, do stay here! Duchess. No! Here is yet Some frightful mystery that is hidden from me. Why does my sister shun me? Don't I see her Full of suspense and anguish roam about From room to room?—Art thou not full of terror? And what import these silent nods and gestures Which stealthwise thou exchangest with her? Thekla. Nothing: Nothing, dear Mother! Duchess (to the Countess). Sister, I will know. Countess. What boots it now to hide it from her? Sooner Or later she must learn to hear and bear it. 'Tis not the time now to indulge infirmity, Courage beseems us now, a heart collected, And exercise and previous discipline Of fortitude. One word, and over with it! Sister, you are deluded. You believe, The Duke has been deposed—The Duke is not Deposed—he is— Thekla (going to the Countess). What? do you wish to kill her? Countess. The Duke is— Thekla (throwing her arms round her mother). O stand firm! stand firm, my mother! Countess. Revolted is the Duke, he is preparing To join the enemy, the army leave him, And all has failed. ACT II Scene I Scene—A spacious Room in the Duke of Friedland's Palace. Wallensten (in armour). Thou hast gained thy point, Octavio! Once more am I Almost as friendless as at Regenspurg. There I had nothing left me, but myself— But what one man can do, you have now experience. The twigs have you hewed off, and here I stand A leafless trunk. But in the sap within Lives the creating power, and a new world May sprout forth from it. Once already have I Proved myself worth an army to you—I alone! Before the Swedish strength your troops had melted; Beside the Lech sank Tilly, your last hope; Into Bavaria, like a winter torrent, Did that Gustavus pour, and at Vienna In his own palace did the Emperor tremble. Soldiers were scarce, for still the multitude Follow the luck: all eyes were turned on me, Their helper in distress; the Emperor's pride Bowed itself down before the man he had injured. 'Twas I must rise, and with creative word Assemble forces in the desolate camps. I did it. Like a god of war, my name Went through the world. The drum was beat—and, lo! The plough, the work-shop is forsaken, all Swarm to the old familiar long-loved banners; And as the wood-choir rich in melody Assemble quick around the bird of wonder, When first his throat swells with his magic song, So did the warlike youth of Germany Crowd in around the image of my eagle. I feel myself the being that I was. It is the soul that builds itself a body, And Friedland's camp will not remain unfilled. Lead then your thousands out to meet me—true! They are accustomed under me to conquer, But not against me. If the head and limbs Separate from each other, 'twill be soon Made manifest, in which the soul abode. (Illo and Tertsky enter.) Courage, friends! Courage! We are still unvanquished; I feel my footing firm; five regiments, Tertsky, Are still our own, and Butler's gallant troops; And a host of sixteen thousand Swedes to-morrow. I was not stronger, when nine years ago I marched forth, with glad heart and high of hope, To conquer Germany for the Emperor. Scene II Wallenstein, Illo, Tertsky. (To them enter Neumann, who leads Tertsky aside, and talks with him.) Tertsky. What do they want? Wallenstein. What now? Tertsky. Ten Cuirassiers From Pappenheim request leave to address you In the name of the regiment. Wallenstein (hastily to Neumann). Let them enter. [Exit Neumann. This May end in something. Mark you. They are still Doubtful, and may be won. Scene III Wallenstein, Tertsky, Illo, Ten Cuirassiers (led by an Anspessade, march up and arrange themselves, after the word of command, in one front before the Duke, and make their obeisance. He takes his hat off, and immediately covers himself again). Anspessade. Halt! Front! Present! Wallenstein (after he has run through them with his eye, to the Anspessade). I know thee well. Thou art out of Brüggin in Flanders: Thy name is Mercy. Anspessade. Henry Mercy. Wallenstein. Thou wert cut off on the march. surrounded by the Hessians, and didst fight thy way with a hundred and eighty men through their thousand. Anspessade. 'Twas even so, General! Wallenstein. What reward hadst thou for this gallant exploit? Anspessade. That which I asked for: the honour to serve in this corps. Wallenstein (turning to a second). Thou wert among the volunteers that seized and made booty of the Swedish battery at Altenburg. Second Cuirassier. Yes, General! Wallenstein. I forget no one with whom I have exchanged words. (A pause). Who sends you? Anspessade. Your noble regiment, the Cuirassiers of Piccolomini. Wallenstein. Why does not your colonel deliver in your request, according to the custom of service? Anspessade. Because we would first know whom we serve. Wallenstein. Begin your address. Anspessade (giving the word of command). Shoulder your arms! Wallenstein (turning to a third). Thy name is Risbeck, Cologne is thy birthplace. Third Cuirassier. Risbeck of Cologne. Wallenstein. It was thou that broughtest in the Swedish colonel, Diebald, prisoner, in the camp at Nuremberg. Third Cuirassier. It was not I, General! Wallenstein. Perfectly right! It was thy elder brother: thou hadst a younger brother too: Where did he stay? Third Cuirassier. He is stationed at Olmutz with the Imperial army. Wallenstein (to the Anspessade). Now then—begin. Anspessade. There came to hand a letter from the Emperor Commanding us— Wallenstein. Who chose you? Anspessade. Every company Drew its own man by lot. Wallenstein. Now! to the business. Anspessade. There came to hand a letter from the Emperor Commanding us collectively, from thee All duties of obedience to withdraw, Because thou wert an enemy and traitor. Wallenstein. And what did you determine? Anspessade. All our comrades At Brannau, Budweiss, Prague and Olmutz, have Obeyed already, and the regiments here, Tiefenbach and Toscana, instantly Did follow their example. But—but we Do not believe that thou art an enemy And traitor to thy country, hold it merely For lie and trick, and a trumped-up Spanish story! Thyself shalt tell us what thy purpose is, For we have found thee still sincere and true: No mouth shall interpose itself betwixt The gallant General and the gallant troops. Wallenstein. Therein I recognize my Pappenheimers. Anspessade. And this proposal makes thy regiment to thee: Is it thy purpose merely to preserve In thy own hands this military sceptre, Which so becomes thee, which the Emperor Made over to thee by a covenant? Is it thy purpose merely to remain Supreme commander of the Austrian armies?— We will stand by thee, General! and guarantee Thy honest rights against all opposition. And should it chance, that all the other regiments Turn from thee, by ourselves will we stand forth Thy faithful soldiers, and, as is our duty, Far rather let ourselves be cut to pieces, Than suffer thee to fall. But if it be As the Emperor's letter says, if it be true, That thou in traitorous wise wilt lead us over To the enemy, which God in heaven forbid! Then we too will forsake thee, and obey That letter— Wallenstein. Hear me, children! Anspessade. Yes, or no! There needs no other answer. Wallenstein. Yield attention. You're men of sense, examine for yourselves; Ye think, and do not follow with the herd: And therefore have I always shewn you honour Above all others, suffered you to reason; Have treated you as free men, and my orders Were but the echoes of your prior suffrage.— Anspessade. Most fair and noble has thy conduct been To us, my General! With thy confidence Thou hast honoured us, and shewn us grace and favour Beyond all other regiments; and thou seest We follow not the common herd. We will Stand by thee faithfully. Speak but one word— Thy word shall satisfy us, that it is not A treason which thou meditatest—that Thou meanest not to lead the army over To the enemy; nor e'er betray thy country. Wallenstein. Me, me are they betraying. The Emperor Hath sacrificed me to my enemies, And I must fall, unless my gallant troops Will rescue me. See! I confide in you. And be your hearts my strong hold! At this breast The aim is taken, at this hoary head. This is your Spanish gratitude, this is our Requital for that murderous fight at Lutzen! For this we threw the naked breast against The halbert, made for this the frozen earth Our bed, and the hard stone our pillow! never stream Too rapid for us, nor wood too impervious: With cheerful spirit we pursued that Mansfield Through all the turns and windings of his flight; Yea, our whole life was but one restless march; And homeless, as the stirring wind, we travelled O'er the war-wasted earth. And now, even now, That we have well-nigh finished the hard toil, The unthankful, the curse-laden toil of weapons, With faithful indefatigable arm Have rolled the heavy war-load up the hill, Behold! this boy of the Emperor's bears away The honours of the peace, an easy prize! He'll weave, forsooth, into his flaxen locks The olive branch, the hard-earn'd ornament Of this grey head, grown grey beneath the helmet. Anspessade. That shall he not, while we can hinder it! No one, but thou, who hast conducted it With fame, shall end this war, this frightful war. Thou led'st us out into the bloody field Of death, thou and no other shalt conduct us home, Rejoicing, to the lovely plains of peace— Shalt share with us the fruits of the long toil— Wallenstein. What? Think you then at length in late old age To enjoy the fruits of toil? Believe it not. Never, no never, will you see the end Of the contest! you and me, and all of us, This war will swallow up! War, war, not peace, Is Austria's wish; and therefore, because I Endeavoured after peace, therefore I fall. For what cares Austria, how long the war Wears out the armies and lays waste the world? She will but wax and grow amid the ruin, And still win new domains. [The Cuirassiers express agitation by their gestures. Ye're moved—I see A noble rage flash from your eyes, ye warriors! Oh that my spirit might possess you now Daring as once it led you to the battle! Ye would stand by me with your veteran arms, Protect me in my rights; and this is noble! But think not that you can accomplish it, Your scanty number! to no purpose will you Have sacrificed you for your General. No! let us tread securely, seek for friends; The Swedes have proffered us assistance, let us Wear for a while the appearance of good will, And use them for your profit, till we both Carry the fate of Europe in our hands, And from our camp to the glad jubilant world Lead Peace forth with the garland on her head! Anspessade. 'Tis then but mere appearances which thou Dost put on with the Swede? Thou'lt not betray The Emperor? Wilt not turn us into Swedes? This is the only thing which we desire To learn from thee. Wallenstein. What care I for the Swedes? I hate them as I hate the pit of hell, And under Providence I trust right soon To chase them to their homes across their Baltic. My cares are only for the whole: I have A heart—it bleeds within me for the miseries And piteous groaning of my fellow-Germans. Ye are but common men, but yet ye think With minds not common; ye appear to me Worthy before all others, that I whisper ye A little word or two in confidence! See now! already for full fifteen years The war-torch has continued burning, yet No rest, no pause of conflict. Swede and German, Papist and Lutheran! neither will give way To the other, every hand's against the other. Each one is party and no one a judge. Where shall this end? Where's he that will unravel This tangle, ever tangling more and more. It must be cut asunder. I feel that I am the man of destiny, And trust, with your assistance, to accomplish it. Scene IV To these enter Butler. Butler (passionately). General! This is not right! Wallenstein. What is not right? Butler. It must needs injure us with all honest men. Wallenstein. But what? Butler. It is an open proclamation Of insurrection. Wallenstein. Well, well—but what is it? Butler. Count Tertsky's regiments tear the Imperial Eagle From off the banners, and instead of it, Have reared aloft thy arms. Anspessade (abruptly to the Cuirassiers). Right about! March! Wallenstein. Cursed be this counsel, and accursed who gave it! [To the Cuirassiers, who are retiring. Halt, children, halt! There's some mistake in this; Hark!—I will punish it severely. Stop! They do not hear. (To Illo.) Go after them, assure them, And bring them back to me, cost what it may. [Illo hurries out. This hurls us headlong. Butler! Butler! You are my evil genius, wherefore must you Announce it in their presence? It was all In a fair way. They were half won, those madmen With their improvident over-readiness— A cruel game is fortune playing with me. The zeal of friends it is that razes me, And not the hate of enemies. Scene V To these enter the Duchess, who rushes into the Chamber. Thekla and the Countess follow her. Duchess. O Albrecht! What hast thou done? Wallenstein. And now comes this beside. Countess. Forgive me, brother! It was not in my power. They know all. Duchess. What hast thou done? Countess (to Tertsky). Is there no hope? Is all lost utterly? Tertsky. All lost. No hope. Prague in the Emperor's hands, The soldiery have ta'en their oaths anew. Countess. That lurking hypocrite. Octavio! Count Max is off too? Tertsky. Where can he be? He's Gone over to the Emperor with his father. [Thekla rushes out into the arms of her mother, hiding her face in her bosom. Duchess (enfolding her in her arms). Unhappy child! and more unhappy mother! Wallenstein (aside to Tertsky). Quick! Let a carriage stand in readiness In the court behind the palace. Scherfenberg Be their attendant; he is faithful to us; To Egra he'll conduct them, and we follow. [To Illo, who returns. Thou hast not brought them back? Illo. Hear'st thou the uproar? The whole corps of the Pappenheimers is Drawn out: the younger Piccolomini, Their colonel, they require; for they affirm, That he is in the palace here, a prisoner; And if thou dost not instantly deliver him, They will find means to free him with the sword. Tertsky. What shall we make of this? Wallenstein. Said I not so? O my prophetic heart! he is still here. He has not betrayed me—he could not betray me. I never doubted of it. Countess. If he be Still here, then all goes well; for I know what [Embracing Thekla. Will keep him here for ever. Tertsky. It can't be. His father has betrayed us, is gone over To the Emperor—the son could not have ventured To stay behind. Thekla (her eye fixed on the door). There he is! Scene VI To these enter Max Piccolomini. Max. Yes! here he is! I can endure no longer To creep on tiptoe round this house, and lurk In ambush for a favourable moment. This loitering, this suspense exceeds my powers. [Advancing to Thekla. Turn not thine eyes away. O look upon me! Confess it freely before all. Fear no one, Let who will hear that we both love each other. Wherefore continue to conceal it? Secrecy Is for the happy—misery, hopeless misery, Needeth no veil! Beneath a thousand suns It dares act openly. [He observes the Countess looking on Thekla with expressions of triumph. No, Lady! No! Expect not, hope it not. I am not come To stay: to bid farewell, farewell for ever. For this I come! 'Tis over! I must leave thee! Thekla, I must—must leave thee! Yet thy hatred Let me not take with me. I pray thee, grant me One look of sympathy, only one look. Say that thou dost not hate me. Say it to me, Thekla! [Grasps her hand. O God! I cannot leave this spot—I cannot! Cannot let go this hand. O tell me, Thekla! That thou dost suffer with me, art convinced That I cannot act otherwise. [Thekla, avoiding his look, points with her hand to her father. Max turns round to the Duke, whom he had not till then perceived. Thou here? It was not thou, whom here I sought. I trusted never more to have beheld thee. My business is with her alone. Here will I Receive a full acquittal from this heart— For any other I am no more concerned. Wallenstein. Think'st thou, that fool-like, I shall let thee go, And act the mock-magnanimous with thee? Thy father is become a villain to me; I hold thee for his son, and nothing more: Nor to no purpose shalt thou have been given Into my power. Think not, that I will honour That ancient love, which so remorselessly He mangled. They are now past by, those hours Of friendship and forgiveness. Hate and vengeance Succeed—'tis now their turn—I too can throw All feelings of the man aside—can prove Myself as much a monster as thy father! Max. Thou wilt proceed with me, as thou hast power. Thou know'st, I neither brave nor fear thy rage. What has detained me here, that too thou know'st. [Taking Thekla by the hand. See, Duke! All—all would I have owed to thee, Would have received from thy paternal hand The lot of blessed spirits. This hast thou Laid waste for ever—that concerns not thee. Indifferent thou tramplest in the dust Their happiness, who most are thine. The god Whom thou dost serve, is no benignant deity. Like as the blind irreconcileable Fierce element, incapable of compact, Thy heart's wild impulse only dost thou follow. Wallenstein. Thou art describing thy own father's heart. The adder! O, the charms of hell o'erpowered me. He dwelt within me, to my inmost soul Still to and fro he passed, suspected never! On the wide ocean, in the starry heaven Did mine eyes seek the enemy, whom I In my heart's heart had folded! Had I been To Ferdinand what Octavio was to me, War had I ne'er denounced against him. No, I never could have done it. The Emperor was My austere master only, not my friend. There was already war 'twixt him and me When he delivered the Commander's Staff Into my hands; for there's a natural Unceasing war 'twixt cunning and suspicion; Peace exists only betwixt confidence And faith. Who poisons confidence, he murders The future generations. Max. I will not Defend my father. Woe is me, I cannot! Hard deeds and luckless have ta'en place, one crime Drags after it the other in close link. But we are innocent: how have we fallen Into this circle of mishap and guilt? To whom have we been faithless? Wherefore must The evil deeds and guilt reciprocal Of our two fathers twine like serpents round us? Why must our fathers' Unconquerable hate rend us asunder, Who love each other? Wallenstein. Max, remain with me. Go you not from me, Max! Hark! I will tell thee— How when at Prague, our winter quarters, thou Wert brought into my tent a tender boy, Not yet accustomed to the German winters; Thy hand was frozen to the heavy colours; Thou would'st not let them go.— At that time did I take thee in my arms, And with my mantle did I cover thee; I was thy nurse, no woman could have been A kinder to thee; I was not ashamed To do for thee all little offices, However strange to me; I tended thee Till life returned; and when thine eyes first opened, I had thee in my arms. Since then, when have I Altered my feelings towards thee? Many thousands Have I made rich, presented them with lands; Rewarded them with dignities and honours; Thee have I loved: my heart, my self, I gave To thee! They all were aliens: thou wert Our child and inmate. Max! Thou canst not leave me; It cannot be; I may not, will not think That Max can leave me. Max. O my God! Wallenstein. I have Held and sustained thee from thy tottering childhood. What holy bond is there of natural love? What human tie, that does not knit thee to me? I love thee, Max! What did thy father for thee, Which I too have not done, to the height of duty? Go hence, forsake me, serve thy Emperor; He will reward thee with a pretty chain Of gold; with his ram's fleece will he reward thee; For that the friend, the father of thy youth, For that the holiest feeling of humanity, Was nothing worth to thee. Max. O God! how can I Do otherwise? Am I not forced to do it? My oath—my duty—honour— Wallenstein. How? Thy duty? Duty to whom? Who art thou? Max! bethink thee What duties may'st thou have? If I am acting A criminal part toward the Emperor, It is my crime, not thine. Dost thou belong To thine own self? Art thou thine own commander? Stand'st thou, like me, a freeman in the world, That in thy actions thou should'st plead free agency? On me thou'rt planted, I am thy Emperor; To obey me, to belong to me, this is Thy honour, this a law of nature to thee! And if the planet, on the which thou liv'st And hast thy dwelling, from its orbit starts, It is not in thy choice, whether or no Thou'lt follow it. Unfelt it whirls thee onward Together with his ring and all his moons. With little guilt stepp'st thou into this contest, Thee will the world not censure, it will praise thee, For that thou heldst thy friend more worth to thee Than names and influences more removed. For justice is the virtue of the ruler, Affection and fidelity the subject's. Not every one doth it beseem to question The far-off high Arcturus. Most securely Wilt thou pursue the nearest duty—let The pilot fix his eye upon the pole-star. Scene VII To these enter Neumann. Wallenstein. What now? Neumann. The Pappenheimers are dismounted, And are advancing now on foot, determined With sword in hand to storm the house, and free The Count, their colonel. Wallenstein (to Tertsky). Have the cannon planted. I will receive them with chain-shot. [Exit Tertsky. Prescribe to me with sword in hand! Go, Neumann! 'Tis my command that they retreat this moment, And in their ranks in silence wait my pleasure. [Neumann exit. Illo steps to the window. Countess. Let him go, I entreat thee, let him go. Illo (at the window). Hell and perdition! Wallenstein. What is it? Illo. They scale the council-house, the roof's uncovered. They level at this house the cannon— Max. Madmen! Illo. They are making preparations now to fire on us. Duchess and Countess. Merciful Heaven! Max (to Wallenstein). Let me go to them! Wallenstein. Not a step! Max (pointing to Thekla and the Duchess). But their life! Thine! Wallenstein. What tidings bring'st thou, Tertsky? Scene VIII To these Tertsky (returning). Tertsky. Message and greeting from our faithful regiments. Their ardour may no longer be curbed in. They intreat permission to commence the attack, And if thou would'st but give the word of onset, They could now charge the enemy in rear, Into the city wedge them, and with ease O'erpower them in the narrow streets. Illo. O come! Let not their ardour cool. The soldiery Of Butler's corps stand by us faithfully; We are the greater number. Let us charge them, And finish here in Pilsen the revolt. Wallenstein. What? shall this town become a field of slaughter, And brother-killing Discord, fire-eyed, Be let loose through its streets to roam and rage? Shall the decision be delivered over To deaf remorseless Rage, that hears no leader? Here is not room for battle, only for butchery. Well, let it be! I have long thought of it, So let it burst then! [Turns to Max. Well, how is it with thee? Wilt thou attempt a heat with me. Away! Thou art free to go. Oppose thyself to me, Front against front, and lead them to the battle; Thou'rt skilled in war, thou hast learned somewhat under me, I need not be ashamed of my opponent, And never had'st thou fairer opportunity To pay me for thy schooling. Countess. Is it then, Can it have come to this?—What! Cousin, Cousin! Have you the heart? Max. The regiments that are trusted to my care I have pledged my troth to bring away from Pilsen True to the Emperor, and this promise will I Make good, or perish. More than this no duty Requires of me. I will not fight against thee, Unless compelled; for though an enemy, Thy head is holy to me still. [Two reports of cannon. Illo and Tertsky hurry to the window. Wallenstein. What's that? Tertsky. He falls. Wallenstein. Falls! Who? Illo. Tiefenbach's corps Discharged the ordnance. Wallenstein. Upon whom? Illo. On Neumann, Your messenger. Wallenstein (starting up). Ha! Death and hell! I will— Tertsky. Expose thyself to their blind frenzy? Duchess and Countess. No! For God's sake, no! Illo. Not yet, my General! Countess. O, hold him! hold him! Wallenstein. Leave me— Max. Do it not Not yet! This rash and bloody deed has thrown them Into a frenzy-fit—allow them time— Wallenstein. Away! too long already have I loitered. They are emboldened to these outrages, Beholding not my face. They shall behold My countenance, shall hear my voice— Are they not my troops? Am I not their General, And their long-feared commander? Let me see, Whether indeed they do no longer know That countenance, which was their sun in battle! From the balcony (mark!) I shew myself To these rebellious forces, and at once Revolt is mounded, and the high-swoln current Shrinks back into the old bed of obedience. [Exit Wallenstein; Illo, Tertsky, and Butler follow. Scene IX Countess, Duchess, Max, and Thekla. Countess (to the Duchess). Let them but see him—there is hope still, sister. Duchess. Hope! I have none! Max (who during the last scene has been standing at a distance advances). This can I not endure. With most determined soul did I come hither, My purposed action seemed unblameable To my own conscience—and I must stand here Like one abhorred, a hard inhuman being; Yea, loaded with the curse of all I love! Must see all whom I love in this sore anguish, Whom I with one word can make happy—O! My heart revolts within me, and two voices Make themselves audible within my bosom. My soul's benighted; I no longer can Distinguish the right track. O, well and truly Didst thou say, father, I relied too much On my own heart. My mind moves to and fro— I know not what to do. Countess. What! you know not? Does not your own heart tell you? O! then I Will tell it you. Your father is a traitor, A frightful traitor to us—he has plotted Against our General's life, has plunged us all In misery—and you're his son! 'Tis yours To make the amends—Make you the son's fidelity Outweigh the father's treason, that the name Of Piccolomini be not a proverb Of infamy, a common form of cursing To the posterity of Wallenstein. Max. Where is that voice of truth which I dare follow? It speaks no longer in my heart. We all But utter what our passionate wishes dictate: O that an angel would descend from Heaven, And scoop for me the right, the uncorrupted, With a pure hand from the pure Fount of Light. [His eyes glance on Thekla. What other angel seek I? To this heart, To this unerring heart, will I submit it, Will ask thy love, which has the power to bless The happy man alone, averted ever From the disquieted and guilty—canst thou Still love me, if I stay? Say that thou canst, And I am the Duke's— Countess. Think, niece— Max. Think nothing, Thekla! Speak what thou feelest. Countess. Think upon your father. Max. I did not question thee, as Friedland's daughter. Thee, the beloved and the unerring god Within thy heart, I question. What's at stake? Not whether diadem of royalty Be to be won or not—that might'st thou think on. Thy friend, and his soul's quiet, are at stake; The fortune of a thousand gallant men, Who will all follow me; shall I forswear My oath and duty to the Emperor? Say, shall I send into Octavio's camp The parricidal ball? For when the ball Has left its cannon, and is on its flight, It is no longer a dead instrument! It lives, a spirit passes into it, The avenging furies seize possession of it, And with sure malice guide it the worst way. Thekla. O! Max— Max. Nay, not precipitately either, Thekla. I understand thee. To thy noble heart The hardest duty might appear the highest. The human, not the great part, would I act. Ev'n from my childhood to this present hour, Think what the Duke has done for me, how loved me, And think too, how my father has repaid him. O likewise the free lovely impulses Of hospitality, the pious friend's Faithful attachment, these too are a holy Religion to the heart; and heavily The shudderings of nature do avenge Themselves on the barbarian that insults them. Lay all upon the balance, all—then speak, And let thy heart decide it. Thekla. O, thy own Hath long ago decided. Follow thou Thy heart's first feeling— Countess Oh! ill-fated woman! Thekla. Is it possible, that that can be the right, The which thy tender heart did not at first Detect and seize with instant impulse? Go, Fulfil thy duty! I should ever love thee. Whate'er thou had'st chosen, thou would'st still have acted Nobly and worthy of thee—but repentance Shall ne'er disturb thy soul's fair peace. Max. Then I Must leave thee, must part from thee! Thekla. Being faithful To thine own self, thou art faithful too to me: If our fates part, our hearts remain united. A bloody hatred will divide for ever The houses Piccolomini and Friedland; But we belong not to our houses—Go! Quick! quick! and separate thy righteous cause From our unholy and unblessed one! The curse of heaven lies upon our head: 'Tis dedicate to ruin. Even me My father's guilt drags with it to perdition. Mourn not for me: My destiny will quickly be decided. [Max clasps her in his arms. There is heard from behind the Scene a loud, wild, long continued cry, ‘Vivat Ferdinandus,’ accompanied by warlike instruments. Scene X To these enter Tertsky. Countess (meeting him). What meant that cry? What was it? Tertsky. All is lost! Countess. What! they regarded not his countenance? Tertsky. 'Twas all in vain. Duchess. They shouted Vivat! Tertsky. To the Emperor. Countess. The traitors! Tertsky. Nay! he was not once permitted Even to address them. Soon as he began, With deafening noise of warlike instruments They drowned his words. But here he comes. Scene XI To these enter Wallenstein, accompanied by Illo and Butler. Wallenstein (as he enters). Tertsky! Tertsky. My General? Wallenstein. Let our regiments hold themselves In readiness to march; for we shall leave Pilsen ere evening. [Exit Tertsky. Butler! Butler. Yes, my General. Wallenstein. The Governor at Egra is your friend And countryman. Write to him instantly By a Post Courier. He must be advised, That we are with him early on the morrow. You follow us yourself, your regiment with you. Butler. It shall be done, my General! Wallenstein (steps between Max and Thekla). Part! Max. O God! [Cuirassiers enter with drawn swords, and assemble in the back-ground. At the same time there are heard from below some spirited passages out of the Pappenheim March, which seem to address Max. Wallenstein (to the Cuirassiers). Here he is, he is at liberty: I keep him No longer. [He turns away, and stands so that Max cannot pass by him nor approach the Princess. Max. Thou know'st that I have not yet learnt to live Without thee! I go forth into a desert, Leaving my all behind me. O do not turn Thine eyes away from me! O once more shew me Thy ever dear and honoured countenance. [Max attempts to take his hand, but is repelled; he turns to the Countess. Is there no eye that has a look of pity for me? [The Countess turns away from him; he turns to the Duchess. My mother! Duchess. Go where duty calls you. Haply The time may come, when you may prove to us A true friend, a good angel at the throne Of the Emperor. Max. You give me hope; you would not Suffer me wholly to despair. No! No! Mine is a certain misery—Thanks to heaven That offers me a means of ending it. [The military music begins again. The stage fills more and more with armed men. Max sees Butler, and addresses him. And you here, Colonel Butler—and will you Not follow me? Well, then! remain more faithful To your new lord, than you have proved yourself To the Emperor. Come, Butler! promise me, Give me your hand upon it, that you'll be The guardian of his life, its shield, its watchman. He is attainted, and his princely head Fair booty for each slave that trades in murder. Now he doth need the faithful eye of friendship, And those whom here I see— [Casting suspicious looks on Illo and Butler. Illo. Go—seek for traitors In Galas, in your father's quarters. Here Is only one. Away! away! and free us From his detested sight! Away! [Max attempts once more to approach Thekla. Wallenstein prevents him. Max stands irresolute, and in apparent anguish. In the mean time the stage fills more and more; and the horns sound from below louder and louder, and each time after a shorter interval. Max. Blow, blow! O were it but the Swedish Trumpets, And all the naked swords, which I see here, Were plunged into my breast! What purpose you? You come to tear me from this place! Beware, Ye drive me not in desperation.—Do it not! Ye may repent it! [The stage is entirely filled with armed men. Yet more! weight upon weight to drag me down! Think what ye're doing. It is not well done To choose a man despairing for your leader; You tear me from my happiness. Well, then. I dedicate your souls to vengeance. Mark! For your own ruin you have chosen me: Who goes with me, must be prepared to perish. [He turns to the background, there ensues a sudden and violent movement among the Cuirassiers; they surround him, and carry him off in wild tumult. Wallenstein remains immovable. Thekla sinks into her mother's arms. The curtain falls. The music becomes loud and overpowering, and passes into a complete war-march—the orchestra joins it— and continues during the interval between the second and third Act. ACT III Scene I The Burgomaster's House at Egra. Butler. Butler. Here then he is, by his destiny conducted. Here, Friedland! and no farther! From Bohemia Thy meteor rose, traversed the sky awhile, And here upon the borders of Bohemia Must sink. Thou hast forsworn the ancient colours, Blind man! yet trustest to thy ancient fortunes. Profaner of the altar and the hearth, Against thy Emperor and fellow-citizens Thou mean'st to wage the war. Friedland, beware— The evil spirit of revenge impels thee— Beware thou, that revenge destroy thee not! Scene II Butler and Gordon Gordon. Is it you? How my heart sinks! The Duke a fugitive traitor! His princely head attainted! O my God! Butler. You have received the letter which I sent you By a post-courier? Gordon. Yes! and in obedience to it Opened the strong hold to him without scruple. For an imperial letter orders me To follow your commands implicitly. But yet forgive me; when even now I saw The Duke himself, my scruples recommenced. For truly, not like an attainted man, Into this town did Friedland make his entrance; His wonted majesty beamed from his brow, And calm, as in the days when all was right, Did he receive from me the accounts of office; 'Tis said, that fallen pride learns condescension: But sparing and with dignity the Duke Weighed every syllable of approbation, As masters praise a servant who has done His duty, and no more. Butler. 'Tis all precisely As I related in my letter. Friedland Has sold the army to the enemy, And pledged himself to give up Prague and Egra. On this report the regiments all forsook him, The five excepted that belong to Tertsky, And which have followed him, as thou hast seen. The sentence of attainder is passed on him, And every loyal subject is required To give him in to justice, dead or living. Gordon. A traitor to the Emperor—Such a noble! Of such high talents! What is human greatness! I often said, this can't end happily. His might, his greatness, and this obscure power Are but a covered pit-fall. The human being May not be trusted to self-government. The clear and written law, the deep trod foot-marks Of ancient custom, are all necessary To keep him in the road of faith and duty. The authority entrusted to this man Was unexampled and unnatural It placed him on a level with his Emperor, Till the proud soul unlearned submission. Wo is me; I mourn for him! for where he fell, I deem Might none stand firm. Alas! dear General, We in our lucky mediocrity Have ne'er experienced, cannot calculate, What dangerous wishes such a height may breed In the heart of such a man. Butler. Spare your laments Till he need sympathy; for at this present He is still mighty, and still formidable. The Swedes advance to Egra by forced marches, And quickly will the junction be accomplished. This must not be! The Duke must never leave This strong hold on free footing; for I have Pledged life and honour here to hold him prisoner, And your assistance 'tis on which I calculate. Gordon. O that I had not lived to see this day! From his hand I received this dignity, He did himself entrust this strong hold to me, Which I am now required to make his dungeon. We subalterns have no will of our own: The free, the mighty man alone may listen To the fair impulse of his human nature. Ah! we are but the poor tools of the law, Obedience the sole virtue we dare aim at! Butler. Nay, let it not afflict you, that your power Is circumscribed. Much liberty, much error! The narrow path of duty is securest. Gordon. And all then have deserted him, you say? He has built up the luck of many thousands; For kingly was his spirit: his full hand Was ever open! Many a one from dust Hath he selected, from the very dust Hath raised him into dignity and honour. And yet no friend, not one friend hath he purchased, Whose heart beats true to him in the evil hour. Butler. Here's one, I see. Gordon. I have enjoyed from him No grace or favour. I could almost doubt, If ever in his greatness he once thought on An old friend of his youth. For still my office Kept me at distance from him; and when first He to this citadel appointed me, He was sincere and serious in his duty. I do not then abuse his confidence, If I preserve my fealty in that Which to my fealty was first delivered. Butler. Say, then, will you fulfil the attainder on him? Gordon. If it be so—if all be as you say— If he've betrayed the Emperor, his master, Have sold the troops, have purposed to deliver The strong holds of the country to the enemy— Yea, truly!—there is no redemption for him! Yet it is hard, that me the lot should destine To be the instrument of his perdition; For we were pages at the court of Bergau At the same period; but I was the senior. Butler. I have heard so— Gordon. 'Tis full thirty years since then. A youth who scarce had seen his twentieth year Was Wallenstein, when he and I were friends: Yet even then he had a daring soul: His frame of mind was serious and severe Beyond his years: his dreams were of great objects. He walked amidst us of a silent spirit, Communing with himself: yet I have known him Transported on a sudden into utterance Of strange conceptions; kindling into splendour His soul revealed itself, and he spake so That we looked round perplexed upon each other, Not knowing whether it were craziness, Or whether it were a god that spoke in him. Butler. But was it where he fell two story high From a window-ledge, on which he had fallen asleep; And rose up free from injury? From this day (It is reported) he betrayed clear marks Of a distempered fancy. Gordon. He became Doubtless more self-enwrapt and melancholy; He made himself a Catholic. Marvellously His marvellous preservation had transformed him. Thenceforth he held himself for an exempted And privileged being, and, as if he were Incapable of dizziness or fall, He ran along the unsteady rope of life. But now our destinies drove us asunder: He paced with rapid step the way of greatness, Was Count, and Prince, Duke-regent, and Dictator. And now is all, all this too little for him; He stretches forth his hands for a king's crown. And plunges in unfathomable ruin. Butler. No more, he comes. Scene III To these enter Wallenstein, in conversation with the Burgomaster of Egra. Wallenstein. You were at one time a free town. I see, Ye bear the half eagle in your city arms. Why the half eagle only? Burgomaster. We were free, But for these last two hundred years has Egra Remained in pledge to the Bohemian crown, Therefore we bear the half eagle, the other half Being cancelled till the empire ransom us, If ever that should be. Wallenstein. Ye merit freedom. Only be firm and dauntless. Lend your ears To no designing whispering court-minions. What may your imposts be? Burgomaster. So heavy that We totter under them. The garrison Lives at our costs. Wallenstein. I will relieve you. Tell me, There are some Protestants among you still? [The Burgomaster hesitates. Yes, yes; I know it. Many lie concealed Within these walls—Confess now—you yourself— Be not alarmed. I hate the Jesuits. Could my will have determined it, they had Been long ago expelled the empire. Trust me— Mass-book or Bible—'tis all one to me. Of that the world has had sufficient proof. I built a church for the reformed in Glogan At my own instance. Hark'e, Burgomaster! What is your name? Burgomaster. Pachhälbel, may it please you. Wallenstein. Hark'e!— But let it go no further, what I now Disclose to you in confidence. [Laying his hand on the Burgomaster's shoulder. The times Draw near to their fulfilment, Burgomaster! The high will fall, the low will be exalted. Hark'e! But keep it to yourself! The end Approaches of the Spanish double monarchy— A new arrangement is at hand. You saw The three moons that appeared at once in the Heaven. Burgomaster. With wonder and affright! Wallenstein. Whereof did two Strangely transform themselves to bloody daggers, And only one, the middle moon, remained Steady and clear. Burgomaster. We applied it to the Turks. Wallenstein. The Turks! That all?—I tell you, that two empires Will set in blood, in the East and in the West, And Luth'ranism alone remain. [Observing Gordon and Butler. I'faith, 'Twas a smart cannonading that we heard This evening, as we journeyed hitherward; 'Twas on our left hand. Did you hear it here? Gordon. Distinctly. The wind brought it from the South. Butler. It seemed to come from Weiden or from Neustadt. Wallenstein. 'Tis likely. That's the route the Swedes are taking. How strong is the garrison? Gordon. Not quite two hundred Competent men, the rest are invalids. Wallenstein. Good! And how many in the vale of Jochim? Gordon. Two hundred arquebussiers have I sent thither To fortify the posts against the Swedes. Wallenstein. Good! I commend your foresight. At the works too You have done somewhat? Gordon. Two additional batteries I caused to be run up. They were needless. The Rhinegrave presses hard upon us, General! Wallenstein. You have been watchful in your Emperor's service. I am content with you, Lieutenant-Colonel. [To Butler. Release the outposts in the vale of Jochim With all the stations in the enemy's route. [To Gordon. Governor, in your faithful hands I leave My wife, my daughter, and my sister. I Shall make no stay here, and wait but the arrival Of letters, to take leave of you, together With all the regiments. Scene IV To these enter Count Tertsky. Tertsky. Joy, General; joy! I bring you welcome tidings. Wallenstein. And what may they be? Tertsky. There has been an engagement At Neustadt; the Swedes gained the victory. Wallenstein. From whence did you receive the intelligence? Tertsky. A countryman from Tirschenseil conveyed it. Soon after sunrise did the fight begin! A troop of the Imperialists from Fachau Had forced their way into the Swedish camp; The cannonade continued full two hours; There were left dead upon the field a thousand Imperialists, together with their Colonel; Further than this he did not know. Wallenstein. How came Imperial troops at Neustadt? Altringer, But yesterday, stood sixty miles from there. Count Galas' force collects at Frauenberg. And have not the full complement. Is it possible, That Suys perchance had ventured so far onward? It cannot be. Tertsky. We shall soon know the whole, For here comes Illo, full of haste, and joyous. Scene V To these enter Illo. Illo (to Wallenstein). A courier, Duke! he wishes to speak with thee. Tertsky. Does he bring confirmation of the victory? Wallenstein. What does he bring? Whence comes he? Illo. From the Rhinegrave. And what he brings I can announce to you Beforehand. Seven leagues distant are the Swedes; At Neustadt did Max Piccolomini Throw himself on them with the cavalry; A murderous fight took place! o'erpower'd by numbers The Pappenheimers all, with Max their leader, Were left dead on the field. Wallenstein (after a pause). Where is the messenger? Conduct me to him. [Wallenstein is going, when Lady Neubrunn rushes into the room. Some servants follow her and run across the stage. Neubrunn. Help! Help! Illo and Tertsky (at the same time). What now? Neubrunn. The Princess! Wallenstein and Tertsky. Does she know it? Neubrunn. She is dying! [Hurries off the stage, when Wallenstein and Tertsky follow her. Scene VI Butler and Gordon. Gordon. What's this? Butler. She has lost the man she lov'd— Young Piccolomini, who fell in the battle. Gordon. Unfortunate Lady! Butler. You have heard what Illo Reporteth, that the Swedes are conquerors, And marching hitherward. Gordon. Too well I heard it. Butler. They are twelve regiments strong, and there are five Close by us to protect the Duke. We have Only my single regiment; and the garrison Is not two hundred strong. Gordon. 'Tis even so. Butler. It is not possible with such small force To hold in custody a man like him. Gordon. I grant it. Butler. Soon the numbers would disarm us, And liberate him. Gordon. It were to be feared. Butler (after a pause). Know, I am warranty for the event; With my head have I pledged myself for his, Must make my word good, cost it what it will, And if alive we cannot hold him prisoner, Why—death makes all things certain! Gordon. Butler! What? Do I understand you? Gracious God! You could— Butler. He must not live. Gordon. And you can do the deed! Butler. Either you or I. This morning was his last. Gordon. You would assassinate him. Butler. 'Tis my purpose. Gordon. Who leans with his whole confidence upon you! Butler. Such is his evil destiny! Gordon. Your General! The sacred person of your General! Butler. My General he has been. Gordon. That 'tis only A ‘has been’ washes out no villainy. And without judgment passed? Butler. The execution Is here instead of judgment. Gordon. This were murder, Not justice. The most guilty should be heard. Butler. His guilt is clear, the Emperor has passed judgment. And we but execute his will. Gordon. We should not Hurry to realize a bloody sentence. A word may be recalled, a life can never be. Butler. Dispatch in service pleases sovereigns. Gordon. No honest man's ambitious to press forward To the hangman's service. Butler. And no brave man loses His colour at a daring enterprize. Gordon. A brave man hazards life, but not his conscience. Butler. What then? Shall he go forth anew to kindle The unextinguishable flame of war? Gordon. Seize him, and hold him prisoner—do not kill him. Butler. Had not the Emperor's army been defeated, I might have done so.—But 'tis now past by. Gordon. O, wherefore opened I the strong hold to him! Butler. His destiny and not the place destroys him. Gordon. Upon these ramparts, as beseemed a soldier, I had fallen, defending the Emperor's citadel! Butler. Yes! and a thousand gallant men have perished. Gordon. Doing their duty—that adorns the man! But murder's a black deed, and nature curses it. Butler (brings out a paper). Here is the manifesto which commands us To gain possession of his person. See— It is addressed to you as well as me. Are you content to take the consequences, If through our fault he escape to the enemy? Gordon. I?—Gracious God! Butler. Take it on yourself. Let come of it what may, on you I lay it. Gordon. O God in heaven! Butler. Can you advise aught else Wherewith to execute the Emperor's purpose? Say if you can. For I desire his fall. Not his destruction. Gordon. Merciful heaven! what must be I see as clear as you. Yet still the heart Within my bosom beats with other feelings! Butler. Mine is of harder stuff! Necessity In her rough school hath steeled me. And this Illo And Tertsky likewise, they must not survive him. Gordon. I feel no pang for these. Their own bad hearts Impelled them, not the influence of the stars. 'Twas they who strewed the seeds of evil passions In his calm breast, and with officious villainy Watered and nursed the pois'nous plants. May they Receive their earnests to the uttermost mite! Butler. And their death shall precede his! We meant to have taken them alive this evening Amid the merry-making of a feast, And kept them prisoners in the citadels. But this makes shorter work. I go this instant To give the necessary orders. Scene VII To these enter Illo and Tertsky. Tertsky. Our luck is on the turn. To-morrow come The Swedes—twelve thousand gallant warriors, Illo! Then straightways for Vienna. Cheerily, friend! What! meet such news with such a moody face? Illo. It lies with us at present to prescribe Laws, and take vengeance on those worthless traitors, Those skulking cowards that deserted us; One has already done his bitter penance The Piccolomini, be his the fate Of all who wish us evil! This flies sure To the old man's heart; he has his whole life long Fretted and toiled to raise his ancient house From a Count's title to the name of Prince; And now must seek a grave for his only son. Butler. 'Twas pity though! A youth of such heroic And gentle temperament! The Duke himself, 'Twas easily seen, how near it went to his heart. Illo. Hark'e, old friend! That is the very point That never pleased me in our General— He ever gave the preference to the Italians. Yea, at this very moment, by my soul! He'd gladly see us all dead ten times over, Could he thereby recall his friend to life. Tertsky. Hush, hush! Let the dead rest! This evening's business Is, who can fairly drink the other down— Your regiment, Illo! gives the entertainment. Come! we will keep a merry carnival— The night for once be day, and mid full glasses Will we expect the Swedish Avantgarde. Illo. Yes, let us be of good cheer for to-day, For there's hot work before us, friends! This sword Shall have no rest, till it be bathed to the hilt In Austrian blood. Gordon. Shame, shame! what talk is this, My Lord Field Marshal? Wherefore foam you so Against your Emperor? Butler. Hope not too much From this first victory. Bethink you, sirs! How rapidly the wheel of Fortune turns; The Emperor still is formidably strong. Illo. The Emperor has soldiers, no commander, For this King Ferdinand of Hungary Is but a tyro. Galas? He's no luck, And was of old the ruiner of armies. And then this viper, this Octavio, Is excellent at stabbing in the back, But ne'er meets Friedland in the open field. Tertsky. Trust me, my friends, it cannot but succeed; Fortune, we know, can ne'er forsake the Duke! And only under Wallenstein can Austria Be conqueror. Illo. The Duke will soon assemble A mighty army, all come crowding, streaming To banners dedicate by destiny To fame and prosperous fortune. I behold Old times come back again, he will become Once more the mighty Lord which he has been. How will the fools, who've now deserted him, Look then? I can't but laugh to think of them, For lands will he present to all his friends, And like a King and Emperor reward True services; but we've the nearest claims. [To Gordon. You will not be forgotten, Governor! He'll take you from this nest and bid you shine In higher station: your fidelity Well merits it. Gordon. I am content already, And wish to climb no higher; where great height is The fall must needs be great. ‘Great height, great depth.’ Illo. Here you have no more business for to-morrow; The Swedes will take possession of the citadel. Come, Tertsky, it is supper-time. What think you? Say, shall we have the State illuminated In honour of the Swede? And who refuses To do it is a Spaniard and a traitor. Tertsky. Nay! Nay! not that, it will not please the Duke— Illo. What! we are masters here; no soul shall dare Avow himself imperial where we've rule. Gordon! Good night, and for the last time, take A fair leave of the place. Send out patroles To make secure, the watch-word may be altered At the stroke of ten; deliver in the keys To the Duke himself, and then you're quit for ever Your wardship of the gates, for on to-morrow The Swedes will take possession of the citadel. Tertsky (as he is going, to Butler). You come though to the castle. Butler. At the right time. [Exeunt Tertsky and Illo. Scene VIII Gordon and Butler. Gordon (looking after them). Unhappy men! How free from all foreboding! They rush into the outspread net of murder, In the blind drunkenness of victory; I have no pity for their fate. This Illo, This overflowing and fool-hardy villain That would fain bathe himself in his Emperor's blood. Butler. Do as he ordered you. Send round patroles. Take measures for the citadel's security; When they are within I close the castle gate That nothing may transpire. Gordon. Oh! haste not so! Nay, stop; first tell me— Butler. You have heard already, To-morrow to the Swedes belongs. This night Alone is ours. They make good expedition, But we will make still greater. Fare you well. Gordon. Ah! your looks tell me nothing good. Nay, Butler, I pray you, promise me! Butler. The sun has set; A fateful evening doth descend upon us, And brings on their long night! Their evil stars Deliver them unarmed into our hands, And from their drunken dream of golden fortunes The dagger at their heart shall rouse them. Well, The Duke was ever a great calculator; His fellow-men were figures on his chess-board. To move and station, as his game required. Other men's honour, dignity, good name, Did he shift like pawns, and made no conscience of it: Still calculating, calculating still; And yet at last his calculation proves Erroneous; the whole game is lost; and lo! His own life will be found among the forfeits. Gordon. O think not of his errors now; remember His greatness, his munificence, think on all The lovely features of his character, On all the noble exploits of his life, And let them, like an angel's arm, unseen Arrest the lifted sword. Butler. It is too late. I suffer not myself to feel compassion, Dark thoughts and bloody are my duty now: [Grasping Gordon's hand. Gordon! 'Tis not my hatred (I pretend not To love the Duke, and have no cause to love him) Yet 'tis not now my hatred that impels me To be his murderer. 'Tis his evil fate. Hostile concurrences of many events Control and subjugate me to the office. In vain the human being meditates Free action. He is but the wire-worked puppet Of the blind power, which out of his own choice Creates for him a dread necessity. What too would it avail him, if there were A something pleading for him in my heart— Still I must kill him. Gordon. If your heart speak to you, Follow its impulse. 'Tis the voice of God. Think you your fortunes will grow prosperous Bedewed with blood—his blood? Believe it not! Butler. You know not. Ask not! Wherefore should it happen, That the Swedes gained the victory, and hasten With such forced marches hitherward? Fain would I Have given him to the Emperor's mercy.—Gordon! I do not wish his blood—But I must ransom The honour of my word—it lies in pledge— And he must die, or— [Passionately grasping Gordon's hand. Listen then, and know! I am dishonoured if the Duke escape us. Gordon. O! to save such a man— Butler. What! Gordon. It is worth A sacrifice.—Come, friend! Be noble-minded! Our own heart, and not other men's opinions, Forms our true honour. Butler. He is a great Lord, This Duke—and I am but of mean importance. This is what you would say? Wherein concerns it The world at large, you mean to hint to me, Whether the man of low extraction keeps Or blemishes his honour— So that the man of princely rank be saved. We all do stamp our value on ourselves. The price we challenge for ourselves is given us. There does not live on earth the man so stationed, That I despise myself compared with him. Man is made great or little by his own will; Because I am true to mine, therefore he dies. Gordon. I am endeavouring to move a rock. Thou hadst a mother, yet no human feelings. I cannot hinder you, but may some God Rescue him from you! [Exit Gordon. Scene IX Butler (alone). I treasured my good name all my life long; The Duke has cheated me of life's best jewel, So that I blush before this poor weak Gordon! He prizes above all his fealty; His conscious soul accuses him of nothing; In opposition to his own soft heart He subjugates himself to an iron duty. Me in a weaker moment passion warped; I stand beside him, and must feel myself The worst man of the two. What though the world Is ignorant of my purposed treason, yet One man does know it, and can prove it too— High-minded Piccolomini! There lives the man who can dishonour me! This ignominy blood alone can cleanse! Duke Friedland, thou or I—Into my own hands Fortune delivers me—The dearest thing a man has is himself. (The curtain drops.) ACT IV Scene I Scene—Butler's Chamber. Butler, and Major Geraldin. Butler. Find me twelve strong dragoons, arm them with pikes, For there must be no firing— Conceal them somewhere near the banquet-room, And soon as the dessert is served up, rush all in And cry—Who is loyal to the Emperor? I will overturn the table—while you attack Illo and Tertsky, and dispatch them both. The castle-palace is well barred and guarded, That no intelligence of this proceeding May make its way to the Duke.—Go instantly; Have you yet sent for Captain Devereux And the Macdonald?— Geraldin. They'll be here anon. [Exit Geraldin. Butler. Here's no room for delay. The citizens Declare for him, a dizzy drunken spirit Possesses the whole town. They see in the Duke A Prince of peace, a founder of new ages And golden times. Arms too have been given out By the town-council, and a hundred citizens Have volunteered themselves to stand on guard. Dispatch then be the word. For enemies Threaten us from without and from within. Scene II Butler, Captain Devereux. and Macdonald. Macdonald. Here we are, General. Devereux. What's to be the watchword? Butler. Long live the Emperor! Both (recoiling). How? Butler. Live the House of Austria! Devereux. Have we not sworn fidelity to Friedland? Macdonald. Have we not marched to this place to protect him? Butler. Protect a traitor, and his country's enemy! Devereux. Why, yes! in his name you administered Our oath. Macdonald. And followed him yourself to Egra. Butler. I did it the more surely to destroy him. Devereux. So then! Macdonald. An altered case! Butler (to Devereux). Thou wretched man! So easily leav'st thou thy oath and colours? Devereux. The devil!—I but followed your example, If you could prove a villain, why not we? Macdonald. We've nought to do with thinking—that's your business. You are our General, and give out the orders; We follow you, though the track lead to hell. Butler. Good then! we know each other. Macdonald. I should hope so. Devereux. Soldiers of fortune are we—who bids most. He has us. Macdonald. 'Tis e'en so! Butler. Well, for the present Ye must remain honest and faithful soldiers. Devereux. We wish no other. Butler. Ay, and make your fortunes. Macdonald. That is still better. Butler. Listen! Both. We attend. Butler. It is the Emperor's will and ordinance To seize the person of the Prince-Duke Friedland, Alive or dead. Devereux. It runs so in the letter. Macdonald. Alive or dead—these were the very words. Butler. And he shall be rewarded from the State In land and gold, who proffers aid thereto. Devereux. Ay? That sounds well. The words sound always well That travel hither from the Court. Yes! yes! We know already what Court-words import. A golden chain perhaps in sign of favour, Or an old charger, or a parchment patent, And such like.—The Prince-duke pays better. Macdonald. Yes, The Duke's a splendid paymaster. Butler. All over With that, my friends! His lucky stars are set. Macdonald. And is that certain? Butler. You have my word for it. Devereux. His lucky fortunes all past by? Butler. For ever. He is as poor as we. Macdonald. As poor as we? Devereux. Macdonald, we'll desert him. Butler. We'll desert him? Full twenty thousand have done that already; We must do more, my countrymen! In short— We—we must kill him. Both. Kill him! Butler. Yes! must kill him. And for that purpose have I chosen you. Both. Us! Butler. You, Captain Devereux, and thee, Macdonald. Devereux (after a pause). Choose you some other. Butler. What? art dastardly? Thou, with full thirty lives to answer for— Thou conscientious of a sudden? Devereux. Nay, To assassinate our Lord and General— Macdonald. To whom we've sworn a soldier's oath— Butler. The oath Is null, for Friedland is a traitor. Devercux. No, no! It is too bad! Macdonald. Yes, by my soul! It is too bad. One has a conscience too— Devereux. If it were not our chieftain, who so long Has issued the commands, and claim'd our duty. Butler. Is that the objection? Devereux. Were it my own father, And the Emperor's service should demand it of me, It might be done perhaps—But we are soldiers, And to assassinate our chief commander, That is a sin, a foul abomination, From which no monk or confessor absolves us. Butler. I am your Pope, and give you absolution. Determine quickly! Devereux. 'Twill not do! Macdonald. 'Twon't do! Butler. Well, off then! and—send Pestalutz to me. Devereux. The Pestalutz— Macdonald. What may you want with him? Butler. If you reject it, we can find enough— Devereux. Nay, if he must fall, we may earn the bounty As well as any other. What think you, Brother Macdonald? Macdonald. Why if he must fall, And will fall, and it can't be otherwise, One would not give place to this Pestalutz. Devereux. When do you purpose he should fall? Butler. This night. To-morrow will the Swedes be at our gates. Devereux. You take upon you all the consequences! Butler. I take the whole upon me. Devereux. And it is The Emperor's will, his express absolute will? For we have instances, that folks may like The murder, and yet hang the murderer. Butler. The manifesto says—alive or dead. Alive—'tis not possible—you see it is not. Devereux. Well, dead then! dead! But how can we come at him? The town is fill'd with Tertsky's soldiery. Macdonald. Ay! and then Tertsky still remains, and Illo— Butler. With these you shall begin—you understand me? Devereux. How? And must they too perish? Butler. They the first. Macdonald. Hear, Devereux? A bloody evening this. Devereux. Have you a man for that? Commission me— Butler. 'Tis given in trust to Major Geraldin; This is a carnival night, and there's a feast Given at the castle—there we shall surprise them, And hew them down. The Pestalutz and Lesley Have that commission—soon as that is finished— Devereux. Hear, General! It will be all one to you. Hark'e! let me exchange with Geraldin. Butler. 'Twill be the lesser danger with the Duke. Devereux. Danger! The devil! What do you think me, General? 'Tis the Duke's eye, and not his sword, I fear. Butler. What can his eye do to thee? Devereux. Death and hell! Thou know'st that I'm no milk-sop, General! But 'tis not eight days since the Duke did send me Twenty gold pieces for this good warm coat Which I have on! and then for him to see me Standing before him with the pike, his murderer, That eye of his looking upon this coat— Why—why—the devil fetch me! I'm no milk-sop! Butler. The Duke presented thee this good warm coat, And thou, a needy wight, hast pangs of conscience To run him through the body in return. A coat that is far better and far warmer Did the Emperor give to him, the Prince's mantle. How doth he thank the Emperor? With revolt, And treason. Devereux. That is true. The devil take Such thankers! I'll dispatch him. Butler. And would'st quiet Thy conscience, thou hast nought to do but simply Pull off the coat; so canst thou do the deed With light heart and good spirits. Devereux. You are right. That did not strike me. I'll pull off the coat— So there's an end of it. Macdonald. Yes, but there's another Point to be thought of. Butler. And what's that, Macdonald? Macdonald. What avails sword or dagger against him? He is not to be wounded—he is— Butler. What? Macdonald. Safe against shot, and stab and flash! Hard frozen, Secured, and warranted by the black art! His body is impenetrable, I tell you. Devereux. In Inglestadt there was just such another— His whole skin was the same as steel; at last We were obliged to beat him down with gunstocks. Macdonald. Hear what I'll do. Devereux. Well? Macdonald. In the cloister here There's a Dominican, my countryman. I'll make him dip my sword and pike for me In holy water, and say over them One of his strongest blessings. That's probatum! Nothing can stand 'gainst that. Butler. So do, Macdonald! But now go and select from out the regiment Twenty or thirty able-bodied fellows, And let them take the oaths to the Emperor. Then when it strikes eleven, when the first rounds Are passed, conduct them silently as may be To the house—I will myself be not far off. Devereux. But how do we get through Hartschier and Gordon, That stand on guard there in the inner chamber? Butler. I have made myself acquainted with the place. I lead you through a back-door that's defended By one man only. Me my rank and office Give access to the Duke at every hour. I'll go before you—with one poniard-stroke Cut Hartschier's wind-pipe, and make way for you. Devereux. And when we are there, by what means shall we gain The Duke's bed-chamber, without his alarming The servants of the Court; for he has here A numerous company of followers? Butler. The attendants fill the right wing; he hates bustle, And lodges in the left wing quite alone. Devereux. Were it well over—hey, Macdonald? I Feel queerly on the occasion, devil knows! Macdonald. And I too. 'Tis too great a personage. People will hold us for a brace of villains. Butler. In plenty, honour, splendour—You may safely Laugh at the people's babble. Devereux. If the business Squares with one's honour—if that be quite certain— Butler. Set your hearts quite at ease. Ye save for Ferdinand His Crown and Empire. The reward can be No small one. Devereux. And 'tis his purpose to dethrone the Emperor? Butler. Yes!—Yes!—to rob him of his crown and life. Devereux. And he must fall by the executioner's hands, Should we deliver him up to the Emperor Alive? Butler. It were his certain destiny. Devereux. Well! Well! Come then, Macdonald, he shall not Lie long in pain. [Exeunt Butler through one door, Macdonald and Devereux through the other. Scene III Scene—A Gothic Apartment at the Duchess Friedland's. Thekla on a seat, pale, her eyes closed. The Duchess and Lady Neubrunn busied about her. Wallenstein and the Countess in conversation. Wallenstein. How knew she it so soon? Countess. She seems to have Foreboded some misfortune. The report Of an engagement, in the which had fallen A colonel of the Imperial army, frighten'd her. I saw it instantly. She flew to meet The Swedish Courier, and with sudden questioning, Soon wrested from him the disastrous secret. Too late we missed her, hastened after her, We found her lying in his arms, all pale And in a swoon. Wallenstein. A heavy, heavy blow! And she so unprepared! Poor child! How is it? [Turning to the Duchess. Is she coming to herself? Duchess. Her eyes are opening. Countess. She lives. Thekla (looking around her). Where am I? Wallenstein (steps to her, raising her up in his arms). Come, cheerly, Thekla! be my own brave girl! See, there's thy loving mother. Thou art in Thy father's arms. Thekla (standing up). Where is he? Is he gone? Duchess. Who gone, my daughter? Thekla. He—the man who uttered That word of misery. Duchess. O! think not of it, My Thekla! Wallenstein. Give her sorrow leave to talk! Let her complain—mingle your tears with hers, For she hath suffered a deep anguish; but She'll rise superior to it, for my Thekla Hath all her father's unsubdued heart. Thekla. I am not ill. See, I have power to stand. Why does my mother weep? Have I alarmed her? It is gone by—I recollect myself— [She casts her eyes round the room, as seeking some one. Where is he? Please you, do not hide him from me. You see I have strength enough: now I will hear him. Duchess. No, never shall this messenger of evil Enter again into thy presence, Thekla! Thekla. My father— Wallenstein. Dearest daughter! Thekla. I'm not weak— Shortly I shall be quite myself again. You'll grant me one request? Wallenstein. Name it, my daughter. Thekla. Permit the stranger to be called to me, And grant me leave, that by myself I may Hear his report and question him. Duchess. No, never! Countess. 'Tis not advisable—assent not to it. Wallenstein. Hush! Wherefore would'st thou speak with him, my daughter? Thekla. Knowing the whole, I shall be more collected; I will not be deceived. My mother wishes Only to spare me. I will not be spared. The worst is said already: I can hear Nothing of deeper anguish! Countess and Duchess. Do it not. Thekla. The horror overpowered me by surprise. My heart betrayed me in the stranger's presence; He was a witness of my weakness, yea, I sank into his arms; and that has shamed me. I must replace myself in his esteem, And I must speak with him, perforce, that he, The stranger, may not think ungently of me. Wallenstein. I see she is in the right, and am inclined To grant her this request of hers. Go, call him. [Lady Neubrunn goes to call him. Duchess. But I, thy mother, will be present— Thekla. 'Twere More pleasing to me, if alone I saw him: Trust me, I shall behave myself the more Collectedly. Wallenstein. Permit her her own will. Leave her alone with him: for there are sorrows, Where of necessity the soul must be Its own support. A strong heart will rely On its own strength alone. In her own bosom, Not in her mother's arms, must she collect The strength to rise superior to this blow. It is mine own brave girl. I'll have her treated Not as the woman, but the heroine. [Going. Countess (detaining him). Where art thou going? I heard Tertsky say That 'tis thy purpose to depart from hence To-morrow early, but to leave us here. Wallenstein. Yes, ye stay here, placed under the protection Of gallant men. Countess. O take us with you, brother. Leave us not in this gloomy solitude To brood o'er anxious thoughts. The mists of doubt Magnify evils to a shape of horror. Wallenstein. Who speaks of evil? I entreat you, sister, Use words of better omen. Countess. Then take us with you. O leave us not behind you in a place That forces us to such sad omens. Heavy And sick within me is my heart— These walls breathe on me, like a church-yard vault. I cannot tell you, brother, how this place Doth go against my nature. Take us with you. Come, sister, join you your entreaty!—Niece, Yours too. We all entreat you, take us with you! Wallenstein. The place's evil omens will I change, Making it that which shields and shelters for me My best beloved. Lady Neubrunn (returning). The Swedish officer. Wallenstein. Leave her alone with him. [Exit. Duchess (to Thekla who starts and shivers). There—pale as death!—Child, 'tis impossible That thou should'st speak with him. Follow thy mother. Thekla. The Lady Neubrunn then may stay with me. [Exeunt Duchess and Countess. Scene IV Thekla, the Swedish Captain, Lady Neubrunn. Captain. Princess—I must entreat your gentle pardon— My inconsiderate rash speech—How could I— Thekla. You did behold me in my agony. A most distressful accident occasioned You from a stranger to become at once My confidant. Captain. I fear you hate my presence, For my tongue spake a melancholy word. Thekla. The fault is mine. Myself did wrest it from you. The horror which came o'er me interrupted Your tale at its commencement. May it please you, Continue it to the end. Captain. Princess, 'twill Renew your anguish. Thekla. I am firm.— I will be firm. Well—how began the engagement? Captain. We lay, expecting no attack, at Neustadt, Entrenched but insecurely in our camp, When towards evening rose a cloud of dust From the wood thitherward; our vanguard fled Into the camp, and sounded the alarm. Scarce had we mounted, ere the Pappenheimers, Their horses at full speed, broke through the lines, And leapt the trenches; but their heedless courage Had borne them onward far before the others— The infantry were still at distance, only The Pappenheimers followed daringly Their daring leader— [Thekla betrays agitation in her gestures. The officer pauses till she makes a sign to him to proceed. Captain. Both in van and flanks With our whole cavalry we now received them; Back to the trenches drove them, where the foot Stretched out a solid ridge of pikes to meet them. They neither could advance, nor yet retreat; And as they stood on every side wedged in, The Rhinegrave to their leader called aloud, Inviting a surrender; but their leader, Young Piccolomini— [Thekla, as giddy, grasps a chair. Known by his plume, And his long hair, gave signal for the trenches; Himself leapt first, the regiment all plunged after. His charger, by a halbert gored, reared up, Flung him with violence off, and over him The horses, now no longer to be curbed,— [Thekla, who has accompanied the last speech with all the marks of increasing agony, trembles through her whole frame, and is falling. The Lady Neubrunn runs to her, and receives her in her arms. Neubrunn. My dearest lady— Captain. I retire. Thekla. 'Tis over. Proceed to the conclusion. Captain. Wild despair Inspired the troops with frenzy when they saw Their leader perish; every thought of rescue Was spurn'd; they fought like wounded tigers; their Frantic resistance rous'd our soldiery; A murderous fight took place, nor was the contest Finish'd before their last man fell. Thekla. And where— Where is—You have not told me all. Captain (after a pause). This morning We buried him. Twelve youths of noblest birth Did bear him to interment; the whole army Followed the bier. A laurel decked his coffin; The sword of the deceased was placed upon it, In mark of honour, by the Rhinegrave's self. Nor tears were wanting; for there are among us Many, who had themselves experienced The greatness of his mind, and gentle manners; All were affected at his fate. The Rhinegrave Would willingly have saved him; but himself Made vain the attempt—'tis said he wished to die. Ncubrunn (to Thekla who has hidden her countenance). Look up, my dearest lady— Thekla. Where is his grave? Captain. At Neustadt, lady; in a cloister church Are his remains deposited, until We can receive directions from his father. Thekla. What is the cloister's name? Captain. Saint Catharine's. Thekla. And how far is it thither? Captain. Near twelve leagues. Thekla. And which the way? Captain. You go by Tirschenreit And Falkenberg, through our advanced posts. Thekla. Who Is their commander? Captain. Colonel Seckendorf. [Thekla steps to the table, and takes a ring from a casket. Thekla. You have beheld me in my agony, And shewn a feeling heart. Please you, accept [Giving him the ring. A small memorial of this hour. Now go! Captain. Princess— [Thekla silently makes signs to him to go, and turns from him. The Captain lingers, and is about to speak. Lady Neubrunn repeats the signal, and he retires. Scene V Thekla, Lady Neubrunn. Thekla (falls on Lady Neubrunn's neck). Now, gentle Neubrunn, shew me the affection Which thou hast ever promised—prove thyself My own true friend and faithful fellow-pilgrim. This night we must away! Neubrunn. Away! and whither? Thekla. Whither! There is but one place in the world. Thither where he lies buried! To his coffin! Neubrunn. What would you do there? Thekla. What do there? That would'st thou not have asked, hadst thou e'er loved. There, there is all that still remains of him. That single spot is the whole earth to me. Neubrunn. That place of death— Thekla. Is now the only place, Where life yet dwells for me: detain me not! Come and make preparations: let us think Of means to fly from hence. Neubrunn. Your father's rage— Thekla. That time is past— And now I fear no human being's rage. Neubrunn. The sentence of the world! The tongue of calumny! Thekla. Whom am I seeking? Him who is no more. Am I then hastening to the arms—O God! I haste but to the grave of the beloved. Neubrunn. And we alone, two helpless feeble women? Thekla. We will take weapons: my arms shall protect thee. Neubrunn. In the dark night-time? Thekla. Darkness will conceal us. Neubrunn. This rough tempestuous night— Thekla. Had he a soft bed Under the hoofs of his war-horses? Neubrunn. Heaven! And then the many posts of the enemy!— Thekla. They are human beings. Misery travels free Through the whole earth. Neubrunn. The journey's weary length— Thekla. The pilgrim, travelling to a distant shrine Of hope and healing, doth not count the leagues. Neubrunn. How can we pass the gates? Thekla. Gold opens them. Go, do but go. Neubrunn. Should we be recognized— Thekla. In a despairing woman, a poor fugitive, Will no one seek the daughter of Duke Friedland. Neubrunn. And where procure we horses for our flight? Thekla. My equerry procures them. Go and fetch him. Neubrunn. Dares he, without the knowledge of his lord? Thekla. He will. Go, only go. Delay no longer. Neubrunn. Dear lady! and your mother? Thekla. Oh! my mother! Neubrunn. So much as she has suffered too already; Your tender mother—Ah! how ill prepared For this last anguish! Thekla. Woe is me! my mother! [Pauses. Go instantly. Neubrunn. But think what you are doing! Thekla. What can be thought, already has been thought. Neubrunn. And being there, what purpose you to do? Thekla. There a divinity will prompt my soul. Neubrunn. Your heart, dear lady, is disquieted! And this is not the way that leads to quiet. Thekla. To a deep quiet, such as he has found. It draws me on, I know not what to name it, Resistless does it draw me to his grave. There will my heart be eased, my tears will flow. O hasten, make no further questioning! There is no rest for me till I have left These walls—they fall in on me—A dim power Drives me from hence—Oh mercy! What a feeling! What pale and hollow forms are those! They fill, They crowd the place! I have no longer room here! Mercy! Still more! More still! The hideous swarm! They press on me; they chase me from these walls— Those hollow, bodiless forms of living men! Neubrunn. You frighten me so, lady, that no longer I dare stay here myself. I go and call Rosenberg instantly. [Exit Lady Neubrunn. Scene VI Thekla. His spirit 'tis that calls me: 'tis the troop Of his true followers, who offered up Themselves to avenge his death: and they accuse me Of an ignoble loitering—they would not Forsake their leader even in his death—they died for him! And shall I live?— For me too was that laurel-garland twined That decks his bier. Life is an empty casket: I throw it from me. O! my only hope;— To die beneath the hoofs of trampling steeds— That is the lot of heroes upon earth! [Exit Thekla. (The curtain drops.) ACT V Scene I Scene—A Saloon, terminated by a gallery which extends far into the back-ground. Wallenstein sitting at a table. The Swedish Captain standing before him. Wallenstein. Commend me to your lord. I sympathize In his good fortune; and if you have seen me Deficient in the expressions of that joy Which such a victory might well demand, Attribute it to no lack of good will, For henceforth are our fortunes one. Farewell, And for your trouble take my thanks. To-morrow The citadel shall be surrendered to you On your arrival. [The Swedish Captain retires. Wallenstein sits lost in thought, his eyes fixed vacantly, and his head sustained by his hand. The Countess Tertsky enters, stands before him awhile, unobserved by him; at length he starts, sees her, and recollects himself. Wallenstein. Com'st thou from her? Is she restored? How is she? Countess. My sister tells me, she was more collected After her conversation with the Swede. She has now retired to rest. Wallenstein. The pang will soften, She will shed tears. Countess. I find thee altered too, My brother! After such a victory I had expected to have found in thee A cheerful spirit. O remain thou firm! Sustain, uphold us! For our light thou art, Our sun. Wallenstein. Be quiet. I ail nothing. Where's Thy husband? Countess. At a banquet—he and Illo. Wallenstein (rises). The night's far spent. Betake thee to thy chamber. Countess. Bid me not go, O let me stay with thee! Wallenstein (moves to the window). There is a busy motion in the Heaven, The wind doth chase the flag upon the tower, Fast sweep the clouds, the sickle of the moon, Struggling, darts snatches of uncertain light. No form of star is visible! That one White stain of light, that single glimmering yonder, Is from Cassiopeia, and therein Is Jupiter. (A pause.) But now The blackness of the troubled element hides him! [He sinks into profound melancholy, and looks vacantly into the distance. Countess (looks on him mournfully, then grasps his hand). What art thou brooding on? Wallenstein. Methinks, If I but saw him, 'twould be well with me. He, is the star of my nativity, And often marvellously hath his aspect Shot strength into my heart. Countess. Thou'lt see him again. Wallenstein. See him again? O never, never again. Countess. How? Wallenstein. He is gone—is dust. Countess. Whom meanest thou then? Wallenstein. He, the more fortunate! yea, he hath finished! For him there is no longer any future, His life is bright—bright without spot it was, And cannot cease to be. No ominous hour Knocks at his door with tidings of mishap. Far off is he, above desire and fear; No more submitted to the change and chance Of the unsteady planets. O 'tis well With him! but who knows what the coming hour Veil'd in thick darkness brings for us! Countess. Thou speakest Of Piccolomini. What was his death? The courier had just left thee as I came. [Wallenstein by a motion of his hand makes signs to her to be silent. Turn not thine eyes upon the backward view, Let us look forward into sunny days, Welcome with joyous heart the victory, Forget what it has cost thee. Not to-day, For the first time, thy friend was to thee dead; To thee he died, when first he parted from thee. Wallenstein. I shall grieve down this blow, of that I'm conscious. What does not man grieve down? From the highest, As from the vilest thing of every day He learns to wean himself: for the strong hours Conquer him. Yet I feel what I have lost In him. The bloom is vanished from my life. For O! he stood beside me, like my youth, Transformed for me the real to a dream, Clothing the palpable and familiar With golden exhalations of the dawn. Whatever fortunes wait my future toils, The beautiful is vanished—and returns not. Countess. O be not treacherous to thy own power. Thy heart is rich enough to vivify Itself. Thou lov'st and prizest virtues in him, The which thyself did'st plant, thyself unfold. Wallenstein (stepping to the door). Who interrupts us now at this late hour? It is the Governor. He brings the keys Of the Citadel. 'Tis midnight. Leave me, sister! Countess. O 'tis so hard to me this night to leave thee— A boding fear possesses me! Wallenstein. Fear? Wherefore? Countess. Should'st thou depart this night, and we at waking Never more find thee! Wallenstein. Fancies! Countess. O my soul Has long been weighed down by these dark forebodings. And if I combat and repel them waking, They still rush down upon my heart in dreams, I saw thee yesternight with thy first wife Sit at a banquet gorgeously attired. Wallenstein. This was a dream of favourable omen, That marriage being the founder of my fortunes. Countess. To-day I dreamt that I was seeking thee In thy own chamber. As I entered, lo! It was no more a chamber; the Chartreuse At Gitschin 'twas, which thou thyself hast founded, And where it is thy will that thou should'st be Interred. Wallenstein. Thy soul is busy with these thoughts. Countess. What dost thou not believe that oft in dreams A voice of warning speaks prophetic to us? Wallenstein. There is no doubt that there exist such voices. Yet I would not call them Voices of warning that announce to us Only the inevitable. As the sun, Ere it is risen, sometimes paints its image In the atmosphere, so often do the spirits Of great events stride on before the events, And in to-day already walks to-morrow. That which we read of the fourth Henry's death Did ever vex and haunt me like a tale Of my own future destiny. The King Felt in his breast the phantom of the knife, Long ere Ravaillac arm'd himself therewith. His quiet mind forsook him: the phantasma Started him in his Louvre, chased him forth Into the open air: like funeral knells Sounded that coronation festival; And still with boding sense he heard the tread Of those feet that ev'n then were seeking him Throughout the streets of Paris. Countess. And to thee The voice within thy soul bodes nothing? Wallenstein. Nothing. Be wholly tranquil. Countess. And another time I hastened after thee, and thou ran'st from me Through a long suite, through many a spacious hall, There seemed no end of it: doors creaked and clapped; I followed panting, but could not o'ertake thee; When on a sudden did I feel myself Grasped from behind—the hand was cold that grasped me— 'Twas thou, and thou did'st kiss me, and there seemed A crimson covering to envelop us. Wallenstein. That is the crimson tapestry of my chamber. Countess (gazing on him). If it should come to that—if I should see thee, Who standest now before me in the fulness Of life— [She falls on his breast and weeps. Wallenstein. The Emperor's proclamation weighs upon thee— Alphabets wound not—and he finds no hands. Countess. If he should find them, my resolve is taken— I bear about me my support and refuge. [Exit Countess. Scene II Wallenstein, Gordon. Wallenstein. All quiet in the town? Gordon. The town is quiet. Wallenstein. I hear a boisterous music! and the Castle Is lighted up. Who are the revellers? Gordon. There is a banquet given at the Castle To the Count Tertsky, and Field Marshal Illo. Wallenstein. In honour of the victory.—This tribe Can shew their joy in nothing else but feasting. [Rings. The Groom of the Chamber enters. Unrobe me. I will lay me down to sleep. [Wallenstein takes the keys from Gordon. So we are guarded from all enemies, And shut in with sure friends. For all must cheat me, or a face like this [Fixing his eye on Gordon. Was ne'er a hypocrite's mask. [The Groom of the Chamber takes off his mantle, collar and scarf. Wallenstein. Take care—what is that? Groom of the Chamber. The golden chain is snapped in two. Wallenstein. Well, it has lasted long enough. Here—give it. [He takes and looks at the chain. 'Twas the first present of the Emperor. He hung it round me in the war of Friule. He being then Archduke; and I have worn it Till now from habit— From superstition if you will. Belike, It was to be a talisman to me, And while I wore it on my neck in faith, It was to chain to me all my life long The volatile fortune whose first pledge it was. Well, be it so! Henceforward a new fortune Must spring up for me; for the potency Of this charm is dissolved. [Groom of the Chamber retires with the vestments. Wallenstein rises, takes a stride across the room, and stands at last before Gordon in a posture of meditation. How the old time returns upon me! I Behold myself once more at Burgau, where We two were pages of the Court together. We oftentimes disputed: thy intention Was ever good; but thou wert wont to play The moralist and preacher, and would'st rail at me— That I strove after things too high for me, Giving my faith to bold unlawful dreams, And still extol to me the golden mean. —Thy wisdom hath been proved a thriftless friend To thy own self. See, it has made thee early A superannuated man, and (but That my munificent stars will intervene) Would let thee in some miserable corner Go out like an untended lamp. Gordon. My Prince! With light heart the poor fisher moors his boat, And watches from the shore the lofty ship Stranded amid the storm. Wallenstein. Art thou already In harbour then, old man? Well! I am not. The unconquered spirit drives me o'er life's billows; My planks still firm, my canvas swelling proudly. Hope is my goddess still, and youth my inmate; And while we stand thus front to front almost, I might presume to say, that the swift years Have passed by powerless o'er my unblanched hair. [He moves with long strides across the saloon, and remains on the opposite side over against Gordon. Who now persists in calling Fortune false? To me she has proved faithful, with fond love Took me from out the common ranks of men, And like a mother goddess, with strong arm Carried me swiftly up the steps of life. Nothing is common in my destiny, Nor in the furrows of my hand. Who dares Interpret then my life for me as 'twere One of the undistinguishable many? True in this present moment I appear Fallen low indeed; but I shall rise again. The high flood will soon follow on this ebb; The fountain of my fortune, which now stops Repressed and bound by some malicious star, Will soon in joy play forth from all its pipes. Gordon. And yet remember I the good old proverb, ‘Let the night come before we praise the day.’ I would be slow from long-continued fortune To gather hope: for hope is the companion Given to the unfortunate by pitying Heaven. Fear hovers round the head of prosperous men, For still unsteady are the scales of fate. Wallenstein (smiling). I hear the very Gordon that of old Was wont to preach to me, now once more preaching; I know well, that all sublunary things Are still the vassals of vicissitude. The unpropitious gods demand their tribute. This long ago the ancient Pagans knew: And therefore of their own accord they offered To themselves injuries, so to atone The jealousy of their divinities: And human sacrifices bled to Typhon. [After a pause, serious, and in a more subdued manner. I too have sacrific'd to him—For me There fell the dearest friend, and through my fault He fell! No joy from favourable fortune Can overweigh the anguish of this stroke. The envy of my destiny is glutted: Life pays for life. On his pure head the lightning Was drawn off which would else have shattered me. Scene III To these enter Seni. Wallenstein. Is not that Seni? and beside himself, If one may trust his looks! What brings thee hither At this late hour, Baptista? Seni. Terror, Duke! On thy account. Wallenstein. What now? Seni. Flee ere the day-break! Trust not thy person to the Swedes! Wallenstein. What now Is in thy thoughts? Seni (with louder voice). Trust not thy person to these Swedes. Wallenstein. What is it then? Seni (still more urgently). O wait not the arrival of these Swedes! An evil near at hand is threatening thee From false friends. All the signs stand full of horror! Near, near at hand the net-work of perdition— Yea, even now 'tis being cast around thee! Wallenstein. Baptista, thou art dreaming!—Fear befools thee. Seni. Believe not that an empty fear deludes me. Come, read it in the planetary aspects; Read it thyself, that ruin threatens thee From false friends! Wallenstein. From the falseness of my friends Has risen the whole of my unprosperous fortunes. The warning should have come before! At present I need no revelation from the stars To know that. Seni. Come and see! trust thine own eyes! A fearful sign stands in the house of life; An enemy, a fiend lurks close behind The radiance of thy planet—O be warned! Deliver not thyself up to these heathens To wage a war against our holy church. Wallenstein (laughing gently). The oracle rails that way! Yes, yes! Now I recollect. This junction with the Swedes Did never please thee—lay thyself to sleep, Baptista! Signs like these I do not fear. Gordon (who during the whole of this dialogue has shewn marks of extreme agitation, and now turns to Wallenstein). My Duke and General! May I dare presume? Wallenstein. Speak freely. Gordon. What if 'twere no mere creation Of fear, if God's high providence vouchsaf'd To interpose its aid for your deliverance, And made that mouth its organ. Wallenstein. Ye're both feverish! How can mishap come to me from the Swedes? They sought this junction with me—'tis their interest. Gordon (with difficulty suppressing his emotion). But what if the arrival of these Swedes— What if this were the very thing that winged The ruin that is flying to your temples? [Flings himself at his feet. There is yet time, my Prince. Seni. O hear him! hear him! Gordon (rises). The Rhinegrave's still far off. Give but the orders, This citadel shall close its gates upon him. If then he will besiege us, let him try it. But this I say; he'll find his own destruction With his whole force before these ramparts, sooner Than weary down the valour of our spirit. He shall experience what a band of heroes, Inspirited by an heroic leader, Is able to perform. And if indeed It be thy serious wish to make amends For that which thou hast done amiss,—this, this Will touch and reconcile the Emperor, Who gladly turns his heart to thoughts of mercy, And Friedland, who returns repentant to him, Will stand yet higher in his Emperor's favour, Than e'er he stood when he had never fallen. Wallenstein (contemplates him with surprise, remains silent awhile, betraying strong emotion). Gordon—your zeal and fervour lead you far. Well, well—an old friend has a privilege. Blood, Gordon, has been flowing. Never, never Can the Emperor pardon me: and if he could, Yet I—I ne'er could let myself be pardoned. Had I foreknown what now has taken place, That he, my dearest friend, would fall for me, My first death-offering: and had the heart Spoken to me, as now it has done—Gordon, It may be, I might have bethought myself. It may be too, I might not. Might or might not. Is now an idle question. All too seriously Has it begun to end in nothing, Gordon! Let it then have its course. [Stepping to the window. All dark and silent—at the castle too All is now hushed—Light me, Chamberlain! [The Groom of the Chamber, who had entered during the last dialogue, and had been standing at a distance and listening to it with visible expressions of the deepest interest, advances in extreme agitation, and throws himself at the Duke's feet. And thou too! But I know why thou dost wish My reconcilement with the Emperor. Poor man! he hath a small estate in Cärnthen, And fears it will be forfeited because He's in my service. Am I then so poor, That I no longer can indemnify My servants? Well! To no one I employ Means of compulsion. If 'tis thy belief That fortune has fled from me, go! Forsake me. This night for the last time mayst thou unrobe me, And then go over to thy Emperor. Gordon, good night! I think to make a long Sleep of it: for the struggle and the turmoil Of this last day or two were great. May't please you! Take care that they awake me not too early. [Exit Wallenstein, the Groom of the Chamber lighting him. Seni follows. Gordon remains on the darkened stage, following the Duke with his eye, till he disappears at the farther end of the gallery: then by his gestures the old man expresses the depth of his anguish, and stands leaning against a pillar. Scene IV Gordon, Butler (at first behind the scenes). Butler (not yet come into view of the stage). Here stand in silence till I give the signal. Gordon (starts up). 'Tis he, he has already brought the murderers. Butler. The lights are out. All lies in profound sleep. Gordon. What shall I do, shall I attempt to save him? Shall I call up the house? Alarm the guards? Butler (appears, but scarcely on the stage). A light gleams hither from the corridor. It leads directly to the Duke's bedchamber. Gordon. But then I break my oath to the Emperor; If he escape and strengthen the enemy, Do I not hereby call down on my head All the dread consequences? Butler (stepping forward). Hark! Who speaks there? Gordon. 'Tis better, I resign it to the hands Of providence. For what am I, that I Should take upon myself so great a deed? I have not murdered him, if he be murdered; But all his rescue were my act and deed; Mine—and whatever be the consequences, I must sustain them. Butler (advances). I should know that voice. Gordon. Butler! Butler. 'Tis Gordon. What do you want here? Was it so late then, when the Duke dismissed you? Gordon. Your hand bound up and in a scarf? Butler. 'Tis wounded. That Illo fought as he was frantic, till At last we threw him on the ground. Gordon. Both dead? Butler. Is he in bed? Gordon. Ah, Butler! Butler. Is he? speak. Gordon. He shall not perish! Not through you! The Heaven Refuses your arm. See—'tis wounded!— Butler. There is no need of my arm. Gordon. The most guilty Have perished, and enough is given to justice. [The Groom of the Chamber advances from the gallery with his finger on his mouth, commanding silence. Gordon. He sleeps! O murder not the holy sleep! Butler. No! he shall die awake. [Is going. Gordon. His heart still cleaves To earthly things: he's not prepared to step Into the presence of his God! Butler (going). God's merciful! Gordon (holds him). Grant him but this night's respite. Butler (hurrying off). The next moment May ruin all. Gordon (holds him still). One hour!— Butler. Unhold me! What Can that short respite profit him? Gordon. O—Time Works miracles. In one hour many thousands Of grains of sand run out; and quick as they, Thought follows thought within the human soul. Only one hour! Your heart may change its purpose, His heart may change its purpose—some new tidings May come; some fortunate event, decisive, May fall from Heaven and rescue him. O what May not one hour achieve! Butler. You but remind me, How precious every minute is! (He stamps on the floor.) Scene V To these enter Macdonald and Devereux, with the Halberdiers. Gordon (throwing himself between him and them). No, monster! First over my dead body thou shalt tread. I will not live to see the accursed deed! Butler (forcing him out of the way). Weak-hearted dotard! [Trumpets are heard in the distance. Devereux and Macdonald. Hark! The Swedish trumpets! The Swedes before the ramparts! Let us hasten! Gordon (rushes out). O, God of Mercy! Butler (calling after him). Governor, to your post! Groom of the Chamber (hurries in). Who dares make larum here? Hush! The Duke sleeps. Devereux (with loud harsh voice). Friend, it is time now to make larum. Groom of the Chamber. Help! Murder! Butler. Down with him! Groom of the Chamber (run through the body by Devereux, falls at the entrance of the gallery). Jesus Maria! Butler. Burst the doors open! [They rush over the body into the gallery—two doors are heard to crash one after the other—Voices deadened by the distance—Clash of arms—then all at once a profound silence. Scene VI Countess Tertsky (with a light). Her bed-chamber is empty; she herself Is no where to be found! The Neubrunn too, Who watched by her, is missing. If she should Be flown—But whither flown? We must call up Every soul in the house. How will the Duke Bear up against these worst bad tidings? O If that my husband now were but returned Home from the banquet: Hark! I wonder whether The Duke is still awake! I thought I heard Voices and tread of feet here! I will go And listen at the door. Hark! What is that? 'Tis hastening up the steps! Scene VII Countess, Gordon. Gordon (rushes in out of breath). 'Tis a mistake, 'Tis not the Swedes—Ye must proceed no further— Butler! O God! Where is he? [Then observing the Countess. Countess! Say— Countess. You are come then from the castle? Where's my husband? Gordon. Your husband!—Ask not!—To the Duke— Countess. Not till You have discovered to me— Gordon. On this moment Does the world hang. For God's sake! to the Duke. While we are speaking— [Calling loudly. Butler! Butler! God! Countess. Why, he is at the castle with my husband. [Butler comes from the gallery. Gordon. 'Twas a mistake—'Tis not the Swedes—it is The Imperialist's Lieutenant-General Has sent me hither, will be here himself Instantly.—You must not proceed. Butler. He comes Too late. [Gordon dashes himself against the wall. Gordon. O God of mercy! Countess. What too late? Who will be here himself? Octavio In Egra? Treason! Treason! Where's the Duke? [She rushes to the gallery. Scene VIII Servants run across the stage full of terror. The whole Scene must be spoken entirely without pauses. Seni (from the gallery). O bloody frightful deed! Countess. What is it, Seni? Page (from the gallery). O piteous sight! [Other Servants hasten in with torches. Countess. What is it? For God's sake! Seni. And do you ask? Within the Duke lies murder'd—and your husband Assassinated at the Castle. [The Countess stands motionless. Female Servant (rushing across the stage). Help! Help! the Duchess! Burgomaster (enters). What mean these confused Loud cries, that wake the sleepers of this house? Gordon. Your house is cursed to all eternity. In your house doth the Duke lie murdered! Burgomaster (rushing out). Heaven forbid! First Servant. Fly! fly! they murder us all! Second Servant (carrying silver plate). That way! The lower Passages are blocked up. Voice (from behind the Scene). Make room for the Lieutenant-General! [At these words the Countess starts from her stupor, collects herself, and retires suddenly. Voice (from behind the Scene). Keep back the people! Guard the door. Scene IX To these enters Octavio Piccolomini with all his train. At the same time Devereux and Macdonald enter from out the Corridor with the Halberdiers. Wallenstein's dead body is carried over the back part of the stage, wrapped in a piece of crimson tapestry. Octavio (entering abruptly). It must not be! It is not possible! Butler! Gordon! I'll not believe it. Say no! [Gordon without answering points with his hand to the body of Wallenstein as it is carried over the back of the stage. Octavio looks that way, and stands overpowered with horror. Devereux (to Butler). Here is the golden fleece—the Duke's sword— Macdonald. Is it your order— Butler (pointing to Octavio). Here stands he who now Hath the sole power to issue orders. [Devereux and Macdonald retire with marks of obeisance. One drops away after the other, till only Butler, Octavio, and Gordon remain on the stage. Octavio (turning to Butler). Was that my purpose, Butler, when we parted? O God of Justice! To thee I lift my hand! I am not guilty Of this foul deed. Butler. Your hand is pure. You have Availed yourself of mine. Octavio. Merciless man! Thus to abuse the orders of thy Lord— And stain thy Emperor's holy name with murder, With bloody, most accursed assassination! Butler. I've but fulfilled the Emperor's own sentence. Octavio. O curse of Kings, Infusing a dread life into their words, And linking to the sudden transient thought The unchangeable irrevocable deed. Was there necessity for such an eager Despatch? Could'st thou not grant the merciful A time for mercy? Time is man's good Angel. To leave no interval between the sentence, And the fulfilment of it, doth beseem God only, the immutable! Butler. For what Rail you against me? What is my offence? The Empire from a fearful enemy Have I delivered, and expect reward. The single difference betwixt you and me Is this: you placed the arrow in the bow; I pulled the string. You sowed blood, and yet stand Astonished that blood is come up. I always Knew what I did, and therefore no result Hath power to frighten or surprise my spirit. Have you aught else to order?—for this instant I make my best speed to Vienna; place My bleeding sword before my Emperor's throne, And hope to gain the applause which undelaying And punctual obedience may demand From a just judge. [Exit Butler. Scene X To these enter the Countess Tertsky, pale and disordered. Her utterance is slow and feeble, and unimpassioned. Octavio (meeting her). O Countess Tertsky! These are the results Of luckless unblest deeds. Countess. They are the fruits Of your contrivances. The Duke is dead, My husband too is dead, the Duchess struggles In the pangs of death, my niece has disappeared. This house of splendour, and of princely glory, Doth now stand desolated: the affrighted servants Rush forth through all its doors. I am the last Therein; I shut it up, and here deliver The keys. Octavio. O Countess! my house too is desolate. Countess. Who next is to be murdered? Who is next To be maltreated? Lo! The Duke is dead. The Emperor's vengeance may be pacified! Spare the old servants; let not their fidelity Be imputed to the faithful as a crime— The evil destiny surprised my brother Too suddenly; he could not think on them. Octavio. Speak not of vengeance! Speak not of maltreatment! The Emperor is appeased; the heavy fault Hath heavily been expiated—nothing Descended from the father to the daughter, Except his glory and his services. The Empress honours your adversity, Takes part in your afflictions, opens to you Her motherly arms! Therefore no farther fears! Yield yourself up in hope and confidence To the Imperial Grace! Countess. To the grace and mercy of a greater Master Do I yield up myself. Where shall the body Of the Duke have its place of final rest? In the Chartreuse, which he himself did found, At Gitschin rests the Countess Wallenstein; And by her side, to whom he was indebted For his first fortunes, gratefully he wished He might sometime repose in death! O let him Be buried there. And likewise, for my husband's Remains, I ask the like grace. The Emperor Is now proprietor of all our castles. This sure may well be granted us—one sepulchre Beside the sepulchres of our forefathers! Octavio. Countess, you tremble, you turn pale! Countess. You think More worthily of me, than to believe I would survive the downfall of my house. We did not hold ourselves too mean to grasp After a monarch's crown—the crown did fate Deny, but not the feeling and the spirit That to the crown belong! We deem a Courageous death more worthy of our free station Than a dishonoured life.—I have taken poison. Octavio. Help! Help! Support her! Countess. Nay, it is too late. In a few moments is my fate accomplished. [Exit Countess. Gordon. O house of death and horrors! [An officer enters, and brings a letter with the great seal. Gordon (steps forward and meets him). What is this? It is the Imperial Seal. [He reads the Address, and delivers the letter to Octavio with a look of reproach, and with an emphasis on the word. To the Prince Piccolomini. [Octavio, with his whole frame expressive of sudden anguish, raises his eyes to heaven. (The curtain drops.) REMORSE PREFACE This Tragedy was written in the summer and autumn of the year 1797; at Nether Stowey, in the county of Somerset. By whose recommendation, and of the manner in which both the Play and the Author were treated by the Recommender, let me be permitted to relate: that I knew of its having been received only by a third person; that I could procure neither answer nor the manuscript; and that but for an accident I should have had no copy of the Work itself. That such treatment would damp a young man's exertions may be easily conceived: there was no need of after-misrepresentation and calumny, as an additional sedative. As an amusing anecdote, and in the wish to prepare future Authors, as young as I then was and as ignorant of the world, of the treatment they may meet with, I will add, that the Person who by a twice conveyed recommendation (in the year 1797) had urged me to write a Tragedy: who on my own objection that I was utterly ignorant of all Stage-tactics had promised that he would himself make the necessary alterations, if the Piece should be at all representable; who together with the copy of the Play (hastened by his means so as to prevent the full developement of the characters) received a letter from the Author to this purport, ‘that conscious of his inexperience, he had cherished no expectations, and should therefore feel no disappointment from the rejection of the Play; but that if beyond his hopes Mr. — found in it any capability of being adapted to the Stage, it was delivered to him as if it had been his own Manuscript, to add, omit, or alter, as he saw occasion; and that (if it were rejected) the Author would deem himself amply remunerated by the addition to his Experience, which he should receive, if Mr. — would point out to him the nature of its unfitness for public Representation’; —that this very Person returned me no answer, and, spite of repeated applications, retained my Manuscript when I was not conscious of any other Copy being in existence (my duplicate having been destroyed by an accident); that he suffered this Manuscript to wander about the Town from his house, so that but ten days ago I saw the song in the third Act printed and set to music, without my name, by Mr. Carnaby, in the year 1802; likewise that the same person asserted (as I have been assured) that the Play was rejected, because I would not submit to the alteration of one ludicrous line; and finally in the year 1806 amused and delighted (as who was ever in his company, if I may trust the universal report, without being amused and delighted?) a large company at the house of a highly respectable Member of Parliament, with the ridicule of the Tragedy, as ‘a fair specimen’, of the whole of which he adduced a line: ‘Drip! drip! drip! there's nothing here but dripping.’ In the original copy of the Play, in the first Scene of the fourth Act, Isidore had commenced his Soliloquy in the Cavern with the words: ‘Drip! drip! a ceaseless sound of water-drops,’ as far as I can at present recollect: for on the possible ludicrous association being pointed out to me, I instantly and thankfully struck out the line. And as to my obstinate tenacity, not only my old acquaintance, but (I dare boldly aver) both the Managers of Drury Lane Theatre, and every Actor and Actress, whom I have recently met in the Green Room, will repel the accusation: perhaps not without surprise. I thought it right to record these circumstances; but I turn gladly and with sincere gratitude to the converse. In the close of last year I was advised to present the Tragedy once more to the Theatre. Accordingly having altered the names, I ventured to address a letter to Mr. Whitbread, requesting information as to whom I was to present my Tragedy. My Letter was instantly and most kindly answered, and I have now nothing to tell but a Tale of Thanks. I should scarce know where to begin, if the goodness of the Manager, Mr. Arnold, had not called for my first acknowledgements. Not merely as an acting Play, but as a dramatic Poem, the ‘Remorse’ has been importantly and manifoldly benefited by his suggestions. I can with severest truth say, that every hint he gave me was the ground of some improvement. In the next place it is my duty to mention Mr. Raymond, the Stage Manager. Had the ‘Remorse’ been his own Play—nay, that is saying too little—had I been his brother, or his dearest friend, he could not have felt or exerted himself more zealously. As the Piece is now acting, it may be thought presumptuous in me to speak of the Actors; yet how can I abstain, feeling, as I do, Mrs. Glover's powerful assistance, and knowing the circumstances under which she consented to act Alhadra? A time will come, when without painfully oppressing her feelings, I may speak of this more fully. To Miss Smith I have an equal, though different acknowledgement to make, namely, for her acceptance of a character not fully developed, and quite inadequate to her extraordinary powers. She enlivened and supported many passages, which (though not perhaps wholly uninteresting in the closet) would but for her have hung heavy on the ears of a Theatrical Audience. And in speaking the Epilogue, a composition which (I fear) my hurry will hardly excuse, and which, as unworthy of her name, is here omitted, she made a sacrifice, which only her established character with all judges of Tragic action, could have rendered compatible with her duty to herself. To Mr. De Camp's judgement and full conception of Isidore; to Mr. Pope's accurate representation of the partial, yet honourable Father; to Mr. Elliston's energy in the character of Alvar, and who in more than one instance gave it beauties and striking points, which not only delighted but surprised me; and to Mr. Rae, to whose zeal, and unwearied study of his part, I am not less indebted as a Man, than to his impassioned realization of Ordonio, as an Author;—to these, and to all concerned with the bringing out of the Play, I can address but one word— Thanks!—but that word is uttered sincerely! and to persons constantly before the eye of the Public, a public acknowledgement becomes appropriate, and a duty. I defer all answers to the different criticisms on the Piece to an Essay, which I am about to publish immediately, on Dramatic Poetry, relatively to the present State of the Metropolitan Theatres. From the necessity of hastening the Publication I was obliged to send the Manuscript intended for the Stage: which is the sole cause of the number of directions printed in italics. S. T. Coleridge. PROLOGUE BY C. LAMB Spoken by Mr. Carr There are, I am told, who sharply criticise Our modern theatres' unwieldy size. We players shall scarce plead guilty to that charge, Who think a house can never be too large: Griev'd when a rant, that's worth a nation's ear, Shakes some prescrib'd Lyceum's petty sphere; And pleased to mark the grin from space to space Spread epidemic o'er a town's broad face.— O might old Betterton or Booth return To view our structures from their silent urn, Could Quin come stalking from Elysian glades, Or Garrick get a day-rule from the shades— Where now, perhaps, in mirth which Spirits approve, He imitates the ways of men above, And apes the actions of our upper coast, As in his days of flesh he play'd the ghost:— How might they bless our ampler scope to please, And hate their own old shrunk up audiences.— Their houses yet were palaces to those, Which Ben and Fletcher for their triumphs chose. Shakspeare, who wish'd a kingdom for a stage, Like giant pent in disproportion'd cage, Mourn'd his contracted strengths and crippled rage. He who could tame his vast ambition down To please some scatter'd gleanings of a town, And, if some hundred auditors supplied Their meagre meed of claps, was satisfied, How had he felt, when that dread curse of Lear's Had burst tremendous on a thousand ears, While deep-struck wonder from applauding bands Return'd the tribute of as many hands! Rude were his guests; he never made his bow To such an audience as salutes us now. He lack'd the balm of labour, female praise. Few Ladies in his time frequented plays, Or came to see a youth with awkward art And shrill sharp pipe burlesque the woman's part. The very use, since so essential grown, Of painted scenes, was to his stage unknown. The air-blest castle, round whose wholesome crest, The martlet, guest of summer, chose her nest— The forest walks of Arden's fair domain, Where Jaques fed his solitary vein— No pencil's aid as yet had dared supply, Seen only by the intellectual eye. Those scenic helps, denied to Shakspeare's page, Our Author owes to a more liberal age. Nor pomp nor circumstance are wanting here; 'Tis for himself alone that he must fear. Yet shall remembrance cherish the just pride, That (be the laurel granted or denied) He first essay'd in this distinguished fane, Severer muses and a tragic strain. EPILOGUE Written by the Author, and spoken by Miss Smith in the character of Teresa. Oh! the procrastinating idle rogue, The Poet has just sent his Epilogue; Ay, 'tis just like him!—and the hand! [Poring over the manuscript. The stick! I could as soon decipher Arabic! But, hark! my wizard's own poetic elf Bids me take courage, and make one myself! An heiress, and with sighing swains in plenty From blooming nineteen to full-blown five-and-twenty, Life beating high, and youth upon the wing, ‘A six years' absence was a heavy thing!’ Heavy!—nay, let's describe things as they are, With sense and nature 'twas at open war— Mere affectation to be singular. Yet ere you overflow in condemnation, Think first of poor Teresa's education; 'Mid mountains wild, near billow-beaten rocks, Where sea-gales play'd with her dishevel'd locks, Bred in the spot where first to light she sprung, With no Academies for ladies young— Academies—(sweet phrase!) that well may claim From Plato's sacred grove th' appropriate name! No morning visits, no sweet waltzing dances— And then for reading—what but huge romances, With as stiff morals, leaving earth behind 'em, As the brass-clasp'd, brass-corner'd boards that bind 'em. Knights, chaste as brave, who strange adventures seek, And faithful loves of ladies, fair as meek; Or saintly hermits' wonder-raising acts, Instead of—novels founded upon facts! Which, decently immoral, have the art To spare the blush, and undersap the heart! Oh, think of these, and hundreds worse than these, Dire disimproving disadvantages, And grounds for pity, not for blame, you'll see, E'en in Teresa's six years' constancy. [Looking at the manuscript. But stop! what's this?—Our Poet bids me say, That he has woo'd your feelings in this Play By no too real woes, that make you groan, Recalling kindred griefs, perhaps your own, Yet with no image compensate the mind, Nor leave one joy for memory behind. He'd wish no loud laugh, from the sly, shrewd sneer, To unsettle from your eyes the quiet tear That Pity had brought, and Wisdom would leave there. Now calm he waits your judgment! (win or miss), By no loud plaudits saved, damn'd by no factious hiss. [S. T. C.] REMORSE A TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS DRAMATIS PERSONAE 1813–1834. Marquis Valdez, Father to the two brothers, and Doña Teresa's Guardian. Don Alvar, the eldest son. Don Ordonio, the youngest son. Monviedro, a Dominican and Inquisitor. Zulimez, the faithful attendant on Alvar. Isidore, a Moresco Chieftain, ostensibly a Christian. Familiars of the Inquisition. Naomi. Moors, Servants, &amp;c. Doña Teresa, an Orphan Heiress. Alhadra, Wife of Isidore. Familiars of the Inquisition. Moors, Servants, &amp;c. Time. The reign of Philip II., just at the close of the civil wars against the Moors, and during the heat of the persecution which raged against them, shortly after the edict which forbade the wearing of Moresco apparel under pain of death. ACT I Scene I The Sea Shore on the Coast of Granada. Don Alvar, wrapt in a Boat cloak, and Zulimez (a Moresco), both as just landed. Zulimez. No sound, no face of joy to welcome us! Alvar. My faithful Zulimez, for one brief moment Let me forget my anguish and their crimes. If aught on earth demand an unmix'd feeling, 'Tis surely this—after long years of exile, To step forth on firm land, and gazing round us, To hail at once our country, and our birth-place. Hail, Spain! Granada, hail! once more I press Thy sands with filial awe, land of my fathers! Zulimez. Then claim your rights in it! O, revered Don Alvar, Yet, yet give up your all too gentle purpose. It is too hazardous! reveal yourself, And let the guilty meet the doom of guilt! Alvar. Remember, Zulimez! I am his brother, Injured indeed! O deeply injured! yet Ordonio's brother. Zulimez. Nobly-minded Alvar! This sure but gives his guilt a blacker dye. Alvar. The more behoves it I should rouse within him Remorse! that I should save him from himself. Zulimez. Remorse is as the heart in which it grows: If that be gentle, it drops balmy dews Of true repentance; but if proud and gloomy, It is a poison-tree, that pierced to the inmost Weeps only tears of poison! Alvar. And of a brother, Dare I hold this, unproved? nor make one effort To save him?—Hear me, friend! I have yet to tell thee, That this same life, which he conspired to take, Himself once rescued from the angry flood, And at the imminent hazard of his own. Add too my oath— Zulimez. You have thrice told already The years of absence and of secrecy, To which a forced oath bound you; if in truth A suborned murderer have the power to dictate A binding oath— Alvar. My long captivity Left me no choice: the very wish too languished With the fond hope that nursed it; the sick babe Drooped at the bosom of its famished mother. But (more than all) Teresa's perfidy; The assassin's strong assurance, when no interest, No motive could have tempted him to falsehood: In the first pangs of his awaken'd conscience, When with abhorrence of his own black purpose The murderous weapon, pointed at my breast, Fell from his palsied hand— Zulimez. Heavy presumption! Alvar. It weighed not with me—Hark! I will tell thee all; As we passed by, I bade thee mark the base Of yonder cliff— Zulimez. That rocky seat you mean, Shaped by the billows?— Alvar. There Teresa met me The morning of the day of my departure. We were alone: the purple hue of dawn Fell from the kindling east aslant upon us, And blending with the blushes on her cheek, Suffused the tear-drops there with rosy light. There seemed a glory round us, and Teresa The angel of the vision! Had'st thou seen How in each motion her most innocent soul Beamed forth and brightened, thou thyself would'st tell me, Guilt is a thing impossible in her! She must be innocent! Zulimez. Proceed, my lord! Alvar. A portrait which she had procured by stealth, (For even then it seems her heart foreboded Or knew Ordonio's moody rivalry) A portrait of herself with thrilling hand She tied around my neck, conjuring me, With earnest prayers, that I would keep it sacred To my own knowledge: nor did she desist, Till she had won a solemn promise from me, That (save my own) no eye should e'er behold it Till my return. Yet this the assassin knew, Knew that which none but she could have disclosed. Zulimez. A damning proof! Alvar. My own life wearied me! And but for the imperative voice within, With mine own hand I had thrown off the burthen. That voice, which quelled me, calmed me: and I sought The Belgic states: there joined the better cause; And there too fought as one that courted death! Wounded, I fell among the dead and dying, In death-like trance: a long imprisonment followed. The fulness of my anguish by degrees Waned to a meditative melancholy; And still the more I mused, my soul became More doubtful, more perplexed; and still Teresa, Night after night, she visited my sleep, Now as a saintly sufferer, wan and tearful, Now as a saint in glory beckoning to me! Yes, still as in contempt of proof and reason, I cherish the fond faith that she is guiltless! Hear then my fix'd resolve: I'll linger here In the disguise of a Moresco chieftain.— The Moorish robes?— Zulimez. All, all are in the sea-cave, Some furlong hence. I bade our mariners Secrete the boat there. Alvar. Above all, the picture Of the assassination— Zulimez. Be assured That it remains uninjured. Alvar. Thus disguised I will first seek to meet Ordonio's—wife! If possible, alone too. This was her wonted walk, And this the hour; her words, her very looks Will acquit her or convict. Zulimez. Will they not know you? Alvar. With your aid, friend, I shall unfearingly Trust the disguise; and as to my complexion, My long imprisonment, the scanty food, This scar—and toil beneath a burning sun, Have done already half the business for us. Add too my youth, since last we saw each other. Manhood has swoln my chest, and taught my voice A hoarser note—Besides, they think me dead: And what the mind believes impossible, The bodily sense is slow to recognize. Zulimez. 'Tis yours, sir, to command, mine to obey. Now to the cave beneath the vaulted rock, Where having shaped you to a Moorish chieftain, I'll seek our mariners; and in the dusk Transport whate'er we need to the small dell In the Alpujarras—there where Zagri lived. Alvar. I know it well: it is the obscurest haunt Of all the mountains— [Both stand listening. Voices at a distance! Let us away! [Exeunt. Scene II Enter Teresa and Valdez. Teresa. I hold Ordonio dear; he is your son And Alvar's brother. Valdez. Love him for himself, Nor make the living wretched for the dead. Teresa. I mourn that you should plead in vain, Lord Valdez, But heaven hath heard my vow, and I remain Faithful to Alvar, be he dead or living. Valdez. Heaven knows with what delight I saw your loves, And could my heart's blood give him back to thee I would die smiling. But these are idle thoughts! Thy dying father comes upon my soul With that same look, with which he gave thee to me; I held thee in my arms a powerless babe, While thy poor mother with a mute entreaty Fixed her faint eyes on mine. Ah not for this, That I should let thee feed thy soul with gloom, And with slow anguish wear away thy life, The victim of a useless constancy. I must not see thee wretched. Teresa. There are woes Ill bartered for the garishness of joy! If it be wretched with an untired eye To watch those skiey tints, and this green ocean; Or in the sultry hour beneath some rock, My hair dishevelled by the pleasant sea breeze, To shape sweet visions, and live o'er again All past hours of delight! If it be wretched To watch some bark, and fancy Alvar there, To go through each minutest circumstance Of the blest meeting, and to frame adventures Most terrible and strange, and hear him tell them; (As once I knew a crazy Moorish maid Who drest her in her buried lover's clothes, And o'er the smooth spring in the mountain cleft Hung with her lute, and played the selfsame tune He used to play, and listened to the shadow Herself had made)—if this be wretchedness, And if indeed it be a wretched thing To trick out mine own death-bed, and imagine That I had died, died just ere his return! Then see him listening to my constancy, Or hover round, as he at midnight oft Sits on my grave and gazes at the moon; Or haply in some more fantastic mood, To be in Paradise, and with choice flowers Build up a bower where he and I might dwell, And there to wait his coming! O my sire! My Alvar's sire! if this be wretchedness That eats away the life, what were it, think you, If in a most assured reality He should return, and see a brother's infant Smile at him from my arms? Oh what a thought! Valdez. A thought? even so! mere thought! an empty thought. The very week he promised his return— Teresa. Was it not then a busy joy? to see him, After those three years' travels! we had no fears— The frequent tidings, the ne'er failing letter. Almost endeared his absence! Yet the gladness, The tumult of our joy! What then if now— Valdez. O power of youth to feed on pleasant thoughts, Spite of conviction! I am old and heartless! Yes, I am old—I have no pleasant fancies— Hectic and unrefreshed with rest— Teresa. My father! Valdez. The sober truth is all too much for me! I see no sail which brings not to my mind The home-bound bark in which my son was captured By the Algerine—to perish with his captors! Teresa. Oh no! he did not! Valdez. Captured in sight of land! From yon hill point, nay, from our castle watch-tower We might have seen— Teresa. His capture, not his death. Valdez. Alas! how aptly thou forget'st a tale Thou ne'er didst wish to learn! my brave Ordonio Saw both the pirate and his prize go down, In the same storm that baffled his own valour, And thus twice snatched a brother from his hopes: Gallant Ordonio! O beloved Teresa, Would'st thou best prove thy faith to generous Alvar, And most delight his spirit, go, make thou His brother happy, make his aged father Sink to the grave in joy. Teresa. For mercy's sake Press me no more! I have no power to love him. His proud forbidding eye, and his dark brow, Chill me like dew-damps of the unwholesome night: My love, a timorous and tender flower, Closes beneath his touch. Valdez. You wrong him, maiden! You wrong him, by my soul! Nor was it well To character by such unkindly phrases The stir and workings of that love for you Which he has toiled to smother. 'Twas not well, Nor is it grateful in you to forget His wounds and perilous voyages, and how With an heroic fearlessness of danger He roam'd the coast of Afric for your Alvar. It was not well—You have moved me even to tears. Teresa. Oh pardon me, Lord Valdez! pardon me! It was a foolish and ungrateful speech, A most ungrateful speech! But I am hurried Beyond myself, if I but hear of one Who aims to rival Alvar. Were we not Born in one day, like twins of the same parent? Nursed in one cradle? Pardon me, my father! A six years' absence is a heavy thing, Yet still the hope survives— Valdez (looking forward). Hush! 'tis Monviedro. Teresa. The Inquisitor! on what new scent of blood? Enter Monviedro with Alhadra. Monviedro. Peace and the truth be with you! Good my Lord, My present need is with your son. We have hit the time. Here comes he! Yes, 'tis he. Enter from the opposite side Don Ordonio. My Lord Ordonio, this Moresco woman (Alhadra is her name) asks audience of you. Ordonio. Hail, reverend father! what may be the business? Monviedro. My lord, on strong suspicion of relapse To his false creed, so recently abjured, The secret servants of the Inquisition Have seized her husband, and at my command To the supreme tribunal would have led him, But that he made appeal to you, my lord, As surety for his soundness in the faith. Though lessoned by experience what small trust The asseverations of these Moors deserve, Yet still the deference to Ordonio's name, Nor less the wish to prove, with what high honour The Holy Church regards her faithful soldiers, Thus far prevailed with me that— Ordonio. Reverend father, I am much beholden to your high opinion, Which so o'erprizes my light services. [Then to Alhadra. I would that I could serve you; but in truth Your face is new to me. Monviedro. My mind foretold me That such would be the event. In truth, Lord Valdez, 'Twas little probable, that Don Ordonio, That your illustrious son, who fought so bravely Some four years since to quell these rebel Moors, Should prove the patron of this infidel! The warranter of a Moresco's faith! Now I return. Alhadra. My Lord, my husband's name Is Isidore. (Ordonio starts.) You may remember it: Three years ago, three years this very week, You left him at Almeria. Monviedro. Palpably false! This very week, three years ago, my lord, (You needs must recollect it by your wound) You were at sea, and there engaged the pirates, The murderers doubtless of your brother Alvar! What, is he ill, my Lord? how strange he looks! Valdez. You pressed upon him too abruptly, father! The fate of one, on whom, you know, he doted. Ordonio. O Heavens! I?—I doted? Yes! I doted on him. [Ordonio walks to the end of the stage, Valdez follows. Teresa. I do not, can not, love him. Is my heart hard? Is my heart hard? that even now the thought Should force itself upon me?—Yet I feel it! Monviedro. The drops did start and stand upon his forehead! I will return. In very truth, I grieve To have been the occasion. Ho! attend me, woman! Alhadra (to Teresa). O gentle lady! make the father stay, Until my lord recover. I am sure, That he will say he is my husband's friend. Teresa. Stay, father! stay! my lord will soon recover. Ordonio (as they return, to Valdez). Strange, that this Monviedro Should have the power so to distemper me! Valdez. Nay, 'twas an amiable weakness, son! Monviedro. My lord, I truly grieve— Ordonio. Tut! name it not. A sudden seizure, father! think not of it. As to this woman's husband, I do know him. I know him well, and that he is a Christian. Monviedro. I hope, my lord, your merely human pity Doth not prevail— Ordonio. 'Tis certain that he was a catholic; What changes may have happened in three years. I can not say; but grant me this, good father: Myself I'll sift him: if I find him sound, You'll grant me your authority and name To liberate his house. Monviedro. Your zeal, my lord, And your late merits in this holy warfare Would authorize an ampler trust—you have it. Ordonio. I will attend you home within an hour. Valdez. Meantime return with us and take refreshment. Alhadra. Not till my husband's free! I may not do it. I will stay here. Teresa (aside). Who is this Isidore? Valdez. Daughter! Teresa. With your permission, my dear lord, I'll loiter yet awhile t' enjoy the sea breeze. [Exeunt Valdez, Monviedro and Ordonio. Alhadra. Hah! there he goes! a bitter curse go with him, A scathing curse! You hate him, don't you, lady? Teresa. Oh fear not me! my heart is sad for you. Alhadra. These fell inquisitors! these sons of blood! As I came on, his face so maddened me, That ever and anon I clutched my dagger And half unsheathed it— Teresa. Be more calm, I pray you. Alhadra. And as he walked along the narrow path Close by the mountain's edge, my soul grew eager; 'Twas with hard toil I made myself remember That his Familiars held my babes and husband. To have leapt upon him with a tiger's plunge, And hurl'd him down the rugged precipice, O, it had been most sweet! Teresa. Hush! hush for shame! Where is your woman's heart? Alhadra. O gentle lady! You have no skill to guess my many wrongs, Many and strange! Besides, I am a Christian, And Christians never pardon—'tis their faith! Teresa. Shame fall on those who so have shewn it to thee! Alhadra. I know that man; 'tis well he knows not me. Five years ago (and he was the prime agent), Five years ago the holy brethren seized me. Teresa. What might your crime be? Alhadra. I was a Moresco! They cast me, then a young and nursing mother, Into a dungeon of their prison house, Where was no bed, no fire, no ray of light, No touch, no sound of comfort! The black air, It was a toil to breathe it! when the door, Slow opening at the appointed hour, disclosed One human countenance, the lamp's red flame Cowered as it entered, and at once sank down. Oh miserable! by that lamp to see My infant quarrelling with the coarse hard bread Brought daily; for the little wretch was sickly— My rage had dried away its natural food. In darkness I remained—the dull bell counting, Which haply told me, that the all-cheering sun Was rising on our garden. When I dozed, My infant's moanings mingled with my slumbers And waked me.—If you were a mother, lady, I should scarce dare to tell you, that its noises And peevish cries so fretted on my brain That I have struck the innocent babe in anger. Teresa. O Heaven! it is too horrible to hear. Alhadra. What was it then to suffer? 'Tis most right That such as you should hear it.—Know you not, What nature makes you mourn, she bids you heal? Great evils ask great passions to redress them, And whirlwinds fitliest scatter pestilence. Teresa. You were at length released? Alhadra. Yes, at length I saw the blessed arch of the whole heaven! 'Twas the first time my infant smiled. No more— For if I dwell upon that moment, Lady, A trance comes on which makes me o'er again All I then was—my knees hang loose and drag, And my lip falls with such an idiot laugh, That you would start and shudder! Teresa. But your husband— Alhadra. A month's imprisonment would kill him, Lady. Teresa. Alas, poor man! Alhadra. He hath a lion's courage, Fearless in act, but feeble in endurance; Unfit for boisterous times, with gentle heart He worships nature in the hill and valley, Not knowing what he loves, but loves it all— Enter Alvar disguised as a Moresco, and in Moorish garments. Teresa. Know you that stately Moor? Alhadra. I know him not: But doubt not he is some Moresco chieftain, Who hides himself among the Alpujarras. Teresa. The Alpujarras? Does he know his danger, So near this seat? Alhadra. He wears the Moorish robes too, As in defiance of the royal edict. [Alhadra advances to Alvar, who has walked to the back of the stage, near the rocks. Teresa drops her veil. Alhadra. Gallant Moresco! An inquisitor, Monviedro, of known hatred to our race— Alvar. You have mistaken me. I am a Christian. Alhadra. He deems, that we are plotting to ensnare him: Speak to him, Lady—none can hear you speak, And not believe you innocent of guile. Teresa. If aught enforce you to concealment, Sir— Alhadra. He trembles strangely. [Alvar sinks down and hides his face in his robe. Teresa. See, we have disturbed him. [Approaches nearer to him. I pray you, think us friends—uncowl your face, For you seem faint, and the night-breeze blows healing. I pray you, think us friends! Alvar (raising his head). Calm, very calm! 'Tis all too tranquil for reality! And she spoke to me with her innocent voice, That voice, that innocent voice! She is no traitress! Teresa. Let us retire (haughtily to Alhadra). Alhadra. He is indeed a Christian. Alvar (aside). She deems me dead, yet wears no mourning garment! Why should my brother's—wife—wear mourning garments? [To Teresa. Your pardon, noble dame! that I disturbed you: I had just started from a frightful dream. Teresa. Dreams tell but of the past, and yet, 'tis said, They prophesy— Alvar. The Past lives o'er again In its effects, and to the guilty spirit The ever-frowning Present is its image. Teresa. Traitress! (Then aside.) What sudden spell o'ermasters me? Why seeks he me, shunning the Moorish woman? Alvar. I dreamt I had a friend, on whom I leant With blindest trust, and a betrothéd maid, Whom I was wont to call not mine, but me: For mine own self seem'd nothing, lacking her. This maid so idolized, that trusted friend Dishonoured in my absence, soul and body! Fear, following guilt, tempted to blacker guilt, And murderers were suborned against my life. But by my looks, and most impassioned words, I roused the virtues that are dead in no man, Even in the assassins' hearts! they made their terms, And thanked me for redeeming them from murder. Alhadra. You are lost in thought: hear him no more, sweet Lady! Teresa. From morn to night I am myself a dreamer, And slight things bring on me the idle mood! Well sir, what happened then? Alvar. On a rude rock, A rock, methought, fast by a grove of firs, Whose thready leaves to the low-breathing gale Made a soft sound most like the distant ocean, I stayed, as though the hour of death were passed, And I were sitting in the world of spirits— For all things seemed unreal! There I sate— The dews fell clammy, and the night descended, Black, sultry, close! and ere the midnight hour A storm came on, mingling all sounds of fear, That woods, and sky, and mountains, seemed one havock. The second flash of lightning shewed a tree Hard by me, newly scathed. I rose tumultuous: My soul worked high, I bared my head to the storm, And with loud voice and clamorous agony, Kneeling I prayed to the great Spirit that made me, Prayed, that Remorse might fasten on their hearts, And cling with poisonous tooth, inextricable As the gored lion's bite! Teresa. A fearful curse! Alhadra. But dreamt you not that you returned and killed them? Dreamt you of no revenge? Alvar. She would have died Died in her guilt—perchance by her own hands! And bending o'er her self-inflicted wounds, I might have met the evil glance of frenzy, And leapt myself into an unblest grave! I prayed for the punishment that cleanses hearts: For still I loved her! Alhadra. And you dreamt all this? Teresa. My soul is full of visions all as wild! Alhadra. There is no room in this heart for puling love-tales. Teresa (lifts up her veil, and advances to Alvar). Stranger, farewell! I guess not who you are, Nor why you so addressed your tale to me. Your mien is noble, and, I own, perplexed me, With obscure memory of something past, Which still escaped my efforts, or presented Tricks of a fancy pampered with long wishing. If, as it sometimes happens, our rude startling, Whilst your full heart was shaping out its dream, Drove you to this, your not ungentle, wildness— You have my sympathy, and so farewell! But if some undiscovered wrongs oppress you, And you need strength to drag them into light, The generous Valdez, and my Lord Ordonio, Have arm and will to aid a noble sufferer, Nor shall you want my favourable pleading. [Exeunt Teresa and Alhadra. Alvar (alone). 'Tis strange! It cannot be! my Lord Ordonio! Her Lord Ordonio! Nay, I will not do it! I cursed him once—and one curse is enough! How sad she looked, and pale! but not like guilt— And her calm tones—sweet as a song of mercy! If the bad spirit retain'd his angel's voice, Hell scarce were Hell. And why not innocent? Who meant to murder me, might well cheat her? But ere she married him, he had stained her honour; Ah! there I am hampered. What if this were a lie Framed by the assassin? Who should tell it him, If it were truth? Ordonio would not tell him. Yet why one lie? all else, I know, was truth. No start, no jealousy of stirring conscience! And she referred to me—fondly, methought! Could she walk here if she had been a traitress? Here where we played together in our childhood? Here where we plighted vows? where her cold cheek Received my last kiss, when with suppressed feelings She had fainted in my arms? It cannot be! 'Tis not in nature! I will die believing, That I shall meet her where no evil is, No treachery, no cup dashed from the lips. I'll haunt this scene no more! live she in peace! Her husband—aye her husband! May this angel New mould his canker'd heart! Assist me, heaven, That I may pray for my poor guilty brother! [Exit. ACT II Scene I A wild and mountainous country. Ordonio and Isidore are discovered, supposed at a little distance from Isidore's house. Ordonio. Here we may stop: your house distinct in view, Yet we secured from listeners. Isidore. Now indeed My house! and it looks cheerful as the clusters Basking in sunshine on yon vine-clad rock, That over-brows it! Patron! Friend! Preserver! Thrice have you saved my life. Once in the battle You gave it me: next rescued me from suicide When for my follies I was made to wander, With mouths to feed, and not a morsel for them: Now but for you, a dungeon's slimy stones Had been my bed and pillow. Ordonio. Good Isidore! Why this to me? It is enough, you know it. Isidore. A common trick of gratitude, my lord, Seeking to ease her own full heart— Ordonio. Enough! A debt repaid ceases to be a debt. You have it in your power to serve me greatly. Isidore. And how, my lord? I pray you to name the thing. I would climb up an ice-glazed precipice To pluck a weed you fancied! Ordonio. Why—that—Lady— Isidore. 'Tis now three years, my lord, since last I saw you: Have you a son, my lord? Ordonio. O miserable— [Aside. Isidore! you are a man, and know mankind. I told you what I wished—now for the truth— She loved the man you kill'd. Isidore. You jest, my lord? Ordonio. And till his death is proved she will not wed me. Isidore. You sport with me, my lord? Ordonio. Come, come! this foolery Lives only in thy looks, thy heart disowns it! Isidore. I can bear this, and any thing more grievous From you, my lord—but how can I serve you here? Ordonio. Why, you can utter with a solemn gesture Oracular sentences of deep no-meaning, Wear a quaint garment, make mysterious antics— Isidore. I am dull, my lord! I do not comprehend you. Ordonio. In blunt terms, you can play the sorcerer. She hath no faith in Holy Church, 'tis true: Her lover schooled her in some newer nonsense! Yet still a tale of spirits works upon her. She is a lone enthusiast, sensitive, Shivers, and can not keep the tears in her eye: And such do love the marvellous too well Not to believe it. We will wind up her fancy With a strange music, that she knows not of— With fumes of frankincense, and mummery, Then leave, as one sure token of his death, That portrait, which from off the dead man's neck I bade thee take, the trophy of thy conquest. Isidore. Will that be a sure sign? Ordonio. Beyond suspicion. Fondly caressing him, her favour'd lover, (By some base spell he had bewitched her senses) She whispered such dark fears of me forsooth, As made this heart pour gall into my veins. And as she coyly bound it round his neck She made him promise silence; and now holds The secret of the existence of this portrait Known only to her lover and herself. But I had traced her, stolen unnotic'd on them, And unsuspected saw and heard the whole. Isidore. But now I should have cursed the man who told me You could ask aught, my lord, and I refuse— But this I can not do. Ordonio. Where lies your scruple? Isidore. Why—why, my lord! You know you told me that the lady lov'd you, Had loved you with incautious tenderness; That if the young man, her betrothéd husband, Returned, yourself, and she, and the honour of both Must perish. Now though with no tenderer scruples Than those which being native to the heart, Than those, my lord, which merely being a man— Ordonio. This fellow is a Man—he killed for hire One whom he knew not, yet has tender scruples! [Then turning to Isidore. These doubts, these fears, thy whine, thy stammering— Pish, fool! thou blunder'st through the book of guilt, Spelling thy villainy. Isidorc. My lord—my lord, I can bear much—yes, very much from you! But there's a point where sufferance is meanness: I am no villain—never kill'd for hire— My gratitude— Ordonio. O aye—your gratitude! 'Twas a well-sounding word—what have you done with it? Isidore. Who proffers his past favours for my virtue— Ordonio. Virtue— Isidore. Tries to o'erreach me—is a very sharper, And should not speak of gratitude, my lord. I knew not 'twas your brother! Ordonio. And who told you? Isidore. He himself told me. Ordonio. Ha! you talk'd with him! And those, the two Morescoes who were with you? Isidore. Both fell in a night brawl at Malaga. Ordonio (in a low voice). My brother— Isidore. Yes, my lord, I could not tell you! I thrust away the thought—it drove me wild. But listen to me now—I pray you listen— Ordonio. Villain! no more. I'll hear no more of it. Isidore. My lord, it much imports your future safety That you should hear it. Ordonio (turning off from Isidore). Am not I a man! 'Tis as it should be! tut—the deed itself Was idle, and these after-pangs still idler! Isidore. We met him in the very place you mentioned. Hard by a grove of firs— Ordonio. Enough—enough— Isidore. He fought us valiantly, and wounded all; In fine, compelled a parley. Ordonio. Alvar! brother! Isidore. He offered me his purse— Ordonio. Yes? Isidore. Yes—I spurned it.— He promised us I know not what—in vain! Then with a look and voice that overawed me, He said, What mean you, friends? My life is dear: I have a brother and a promised wife, Who make life dear to me—and if I fall, That brother will roam earth and hell for vengeance. There was a likeness in his face to yours; I asked his brother's name: he said—Ordonio, Son of Lord Valdez! I had well nigh fainted. At length I said (if that indeed I said it, And that no Spirit made my tongue its organ,) That woman is dishonoured by that brother, And he the man who sent us to destroy you. He drove a thrust at me in rage. I told him He wore her portrait round his neck. He look'd As he had been made of the rock that propt his back— Aye, just as you look now—only less ghastly! At length recovering from his trance, he threw His sword away, and bade us take his life, It was not worth his keeping. Ordonio. And you kill'd him? Oh blood hounds! may eternal wrath flame round you! He was his Maker's Image undefac'd! It seizes me—by Hell I will go on! What—would'st thou stop, man? thy pale looks won't save thee! Oh cold—cold—cold! shot through with icy cold! Isidore (aside). Were he alive he had returned ere now. The consequence the same—dead through his plotting! Ordonio. O this unutterable dying away—here— This sickness of the heart! What if I went And liv'd in a hollow tomb, and fed on weeds? Aye! that's the road to heaven! O fool! fool! fool! What have I done but that which nature destined, Or the blind elements stirred up within me? If good were meant, why were we made these beings? And if not meant— Isidore. You are disturbed, my lord! Ordonio (starts). A gust of the soul! i'faith it overset me. O 'twas all folly—all! idle as laughter! Now, Isidore! I swear that thou shalt aid me. Isidore (in a low voice). I'll perish first! Ordonio. What dost thou mutter of? Isidore. Some of your servants know me, I am certain. Ordonio. There's some sense in that scruple; but we'll mask you. Isidore. They'll know my gait: but stay! last night I watched A stranger near the ruin in the wood, Who as it seemed was gathering herbs and wild flowers. I had followed him at distance, seen him scale Its western wall, and by an easier entrance Stole after him unnoticed. There I marked, That mid the chequer work of light and shade With curious choice he plucked no other flowers, But those on which the moonlight fell: and once I heard him muttering o'er the plant. A wizard— Some gaunt slave prowling here for dark employment. Ordonio. Doubtless you question'd him? Isidore. 'Twas my intention, Having first traced him homeward to his haunt. But lo! the stern Dominican, whose spies Lurk every where, already (as it seemed) Had given commission to his apt familiar To seek and sound the Moor; who now returning, Was by this trusty agent stopped midway. I, dreading fresh suspicion if found near him In that lone place, again concealed myself: Yet within hearing. So the Moor was question'd, And in your name, as lord of this domain, Proudly he answered, ‘Say to the Lord Ordonio, He that can bring the dead to life again!’ Ordonio. A strange reply! Isidore. Aye, all of him is strange. He called himself a Christian, yet he wears The Moorish robes, as if he courted death. Ordonio. Where does this wizard live? Isidore (pointing to the distance). You see that brooklet? Trace its course backward: through a narrow opening It leads you to the place. Ordonio. How shall I know it? Isidore. You cannot err. It is a small green dell Built all around with high off-sloping hills, And from its shape our peasants aptly call it The Giant's Cradle. There's a lake in the midst, And round its banks tall wood that branches over, And makes a kind of faery forest grow Down in the water. At the further end A puny cataract falls on the lake; And there, a curious sight! you see its shadow For ever curling, like a wreath of smoke, Up through the foliage of those faery trees. His cot stands opposite. You cannot miss it. Ordonio (in retiring stops suddenly at the edge of the scene, and then turning round to Isidore). Ha!—Who lurks there! Have we been overheard? There where the smooth high wall of slate-rock glitters— Isidore. 'Neath those tall stones, which propping each the other, Form a mock portal with their pointed arch? Pardon my smiles! 'Tis a poor idiot boy, Who sits in the sun, and twirls a bough about, His weak eyes seeth'd in most unmeaning tears. And so he sits, swaying his cone-like head, And staring at his bough from morn to sun-set, See-saws his voice in inarticulate noises. Ordonio. 'Tis well, and now for this same wizard's lair. Isidore. Some three strides up the hill, a mountain ash Stretches its lower boughs and scarlet clusters O'er the old thatch. Ordonio. I shall not fail to find it. [Exeunt Ordonio and Isidore. Scene II The inside of a Cottage, around which flowers and plants of various kinds are seen. Discovers Alvar, Zulimez and Alhadra, as on the point of leaving. Alhadra (addressing Alvar). Farewell then! and though many thoughts perplex me, Aught evil or ignoble never can I Suspect of thee! If what thou seem'st thou art, The oppressed brethren of thy blood have need Of such a leader. Alvar. Nobly-minded woman! Long time against oppression have I fought, And for the native liberty of faith Have bled and suffered bonds. Of this be certain: Time, as he courses onward, still unrolls The volume of concealment. In the future, As in the optician's glassy cylinder, The indistinguishable blots and colours Of the dim past collect and shape themselves, Upstarting in their own completed image To scare or to reward. I sought the guilty, And what I sought I found: but ere the spear Flew from my hand, there rose an angel form Betwixt me and my aim. With baffled purpose To the Avenger I leave vengeance, and depart! Whate'er betide, if aught my arm may aid, Or power protect, my word is pledged to thee: For many are thy wrongs, and thy soul noble. Once more, farewell. [Exit Alhadra. Yes, to the Belgic states We will return. These robes, this stained complexion, Akin to falsehood, weigh upon my spirit. Whate'er befall us, the heroic Maurice Will grant us an asylum, in remembrance Of our past services. Zulimez. And all the wealth, power, influence which is yours, You let a murderer hold? Alvar. O faithful Zulimez! That my return involved Ordonio's death, I trust, would give me an unmingled pang, Yet bearable:—but when I see my father Strewing his scant grey hairs, e'en on the ground, Which soon must be his grave, and my Teresa— Her husband proved a murderer, and her infants His infants—poor Teresa!—all would perish, All perish—all! and I (nay bear with me) Could not survive the complicated ruin! Zulimez. Nay now! I have distress'd you—you well know, I ne'er will quit your fortunes. True, 'tis tiresome! You are a painter, one of many fancies! You can call up past deeds, and make them live On the blank canvas! and each little herb, That grows on mountain bleak, or tangled forest, You have learnt to name— Hark! heard you not some footsteps? Alvar. What if it were my brother coming onwards? I sent a most mysterious message to him. Enter Ordonio Alvar. It is he! Ordonio (to himself as he enters). If I distinguish'd right her gait and stature, It was the Moorish woman, Isidore's wife, That passed me as I entered. A lit taper, In the night air, doth not more naturally Attract the night-flies round it, than a conjuror Draws round him the whole female neighbourhood. [Addressing Alvar. You know my name, I guess, if not my person. I am Ordonio, son of the Lord Valdez. Alvar. The Son of Valdez! [Ordonio walks leisurely round the room, and looks attentively at the plants. Zulimez (to Alvar). Why, what ails you now? How your hand trembles! Alvar, speak! what wish you? Alvar. To fall upon his neck and weep forgiveness! Ordonio (returning, and aloud). Plucked in the moonlight from a ruined abbey— Those only, which the pale rays visited! O the unintelligible power of weeds, When a few odd prayers have been muttered o'er them: Then they work miracles! I warrant you, There's not a leaf, but underneath it lurks Some serviceable imp. There's one of you Hath sent me a strange message. Alvar. I am he. Ordonio. With you, then, I am to speak: [Haughtily waving his hand to Zulimez. And mark you, alone. [Exit Zulimez. ‘He that can bring the dead to life again!’— Such was your message, Sir! You are no dullard, But one that strips the outward rind of things! Alvar. 'Tis fabled there are fruits with tempting rinds, That are all dust and rottenness within. Would'st thou I should strip such? Ordonio. Thou quibbling fool, What dost thou mean? Think'st thou I journeyed hither To sport with thee? Alvar. O no, my lord! to sport Best suits the gaiety of innocence. Ordonio (aside). O what a thing is man! the wisest heart A fool! a fool that laughs at its own folly, Yet still a fool! [Looks round the cottage. You are poor! Alvar. What follows thence? Ordonio. That you would fain be richer. The inquisition, too—You comprehend me? You are poor, in peril. I have wealth and power, Can quench the flames, and cure your poverty: And for the boon I ask of you but this, That you should serve me—once—for a few hours. Alvar. Thou art the son of Valdez! would to Heaven That I could truly and for ever serve thee. Ordonio. The slave begins to soften. [Aside. You are my friend, ‘He that can bring the dead to life again,’ Nay, no defence to me! The holy brethren Believe these calumnies—I know thee better. Thou art a man, and as a man I'll trust thee! Alvar (aside). Alas! this hollow mirth—Declare your business. Ordonio. I love a lady, and she would love me But for an idle and fantastic scruple. Have you no servants here, no listeners? [Ordonio steps to the door. Alvar. What, faithless too? False to his angel wife? To such a wife? Well might'st thou look so wan, Ill-starr'd Teresa!—Wretch! my softer soul Is pass'd away, and I will probe his conscience! Ordonio. In truth this lady lov'd another man, But he has perish'd. Alvar. What! you kill'd him? hey? Ordonio. I'll dash thee to the earth, if thou but think'st it! Insolent slave! how dar'dst thou— [Turns abruptly from Alvar, and then to himself. Why! what's this? 'Twas idiotcy! I'll tie myself to an aspen, And wear a fool's cap— Alvar. Fare thee well— I pity thee, Ordonio, even to anguish. [Alvar is retiring. Ordonio. Ho! [Calling to Alvar. Alvar. Be brief, what wish you? Ordonio. You are deep at bartering—You charge yourself At a round sum. Come, come, I spake unwisely. Alvar. I listen to you. Ordonio. In a sudden tempest Did Alvar perish—he, I mean—the lover— The fellow— Alvar. Nay, speak out! 'twill ease your heart To call him villain!—Why stand'st thou aghast? Men think it natural to hate their rivals. Ordonio. Now, till she knows him dead, she will not wed me. Alvar. Are you not wedded, then? Merciful Heaven! Not wedded to Teresa? Ordonio. Why, what ails thee? What, art thou mad? why look'st thou upward so? Dost pray to Lucifer, Prince of the Air? Alvar. Proceed. I shall be silent. Ordonio. To Teresa? Politic wizard! ere you sent that message, You had conn'd your lesson, made yourself proficient In all my fortunes. Hah! you prophesied A golden crop! Well, you have not mistaken— Be faithful to me and I'll pay thee nobly. Alvar. Well! and this lady! Ordonio. If we could make her certain of his death, She needs must wed me. Ere her lover left her, She tied a little portrait round his neck, Entreating him to wear it. Alvar. Yes! he did so! Ordonio. Why no: he was afraid of accidents, Of robberies, and shipwrecks, and the like. In secrecy he gave it me to keep, Till his return. Alvar. What! he was your friend then? Ordonio. I was his friend.— Now that he gave it me, This lady knows not. You are a mighty wizard— Can call the dead man up—he will not come.— He is in heaven then—there you have no influence. Still there are tokens—and your imps may bring you Something he wore about him when he died. And when the smoke of the incense on the altar Is pass'd, your spirits will have left this picture. What say you now? Alvar. Ordonio, I will do it. Ordonio. We'll hazard no delay. Be it to-night, In the early evening. Ask for the Lord Valdez. I will prepare him. Music too, and incense, (For I have arranged it—music, altar, incense) All shall be ready. Here is this same picture, And here, what you will value more, a purse. Come early for your magic ceremonies. Alvar. I will not fail to meet you. Ordonio. Till next we meet, farewell! [Exit Ordonio. Alvar (alone, indignantly flings the purse away and gazes passionately at the portrait). And I did curse thee! At midnight! on my knees! and I believed Thee perjur'd, thee a traitress! thee dishonour'd! O blind and credulous fool! O guilt of folly! Should not thy inarticulate fondnesses, Thy infant loves—should not thy maiden vows Have come upon my heart? And this sweet Image Tied round my neck with many a chaste endearment, And thrilling hands, that made me weep and tremble— Ah, coward dupe! to yield it to the miscreant, Who spake pollution of thee! barter for life This farewell pledge, which with impassioned vow I had sworn that I would grasp—ev'n in my Death-pang! I am unworthy of thy love, Teresa, Of that unearthly smile upon those lips, Which ever smiled on me! Yet do not scorn me— I lisp'd thy name, ere I had learnt my mother's. Dear portrait! rescued from a traitor's keeping, I will not now profane thee, holy image, To a dark trick. That worst bad man shall find A picture, which will wake the hell within him, And rouse a fiery whirlwind in his conscience. ACT III Scene I A Hall of Armory, with an Altar at the back of the Stage. Soft Music from an instrument of Glass or Steel. Valdez, Ordonio, and Alvar in a Sorcerer's robe, are discovered. Ordonio. This was too melancholy, Father. Valdez. Nay, My Alvar lov'd sad music from a child. Once he was lost; and after weary search We found him in an open place in the wood. To which spot he had followed a blind boy, Who breath'd into a pipe of sycamore Some strangely moving notes: and these, he said, Were taught him in a dream. Him we first saw Stretch'd on the broad top of a sunny heath-bank: And lower down poor Alvar, fast asleep, His head upon the blind boy's dog. It pleas'd me To mark how he had fasten'd round the pipe A silver toy his grandam had late given him. Methinks I see him now as he then look'd— Even so!—He had outgrown his infant dress, Yet still he wore it. Alvar (aside). My tears must not flow! I must not clasp his knees, and cry, My father! Enter Teresa and Attendants. Teresa. Lord Valdez, you have asked my presence here, And I submit; but (Heaven bear witness for me) My heart approves it not! 'tis mockery. Ordonio. Believe you then no preternatural influence: Believe you not that spirits throng around us? Teresa. Say rather that I have imagined it A possible thing: and it has sooth'd my soul As other fancies have; but ne'er seduced me To traffic with the black and frenzied hope That the dead hear the voice of witch or wizard. [To Alvar. Stranger, I mourn and blush to see you here, On such employment! With far other thoughts I left you. Ordonio (aside). Ha! he has been tampering with her? Alvar. O high-soul'd Maiden! and more dear to me Than suits the stranger's name!— I swear to thee I will uncover all concealéd guilt. Doubt, but decide not! Stand ye from the altar. [Here a strain of music is heard from behind the scene. Alvar. With no irreverent voice or uncouth charm I call up the departed! Soul of Alvar! Hear our soft suit, and heed my milder spell: So may the gates of Paradise, unbarr'd, Cease thy swift toils! Since haply thou art one Of that innumerable company Who in broad circle, lovelier than the rainbow, Girdle this round earth in a dizzy motion, With noise too vast and constant to be heard: Fitliest unheard! For oh, ye numberless, And rapid travellers! what ear unstunn'd, What sense unmadden'd, might bear up against The rushing of your congregated wings? [Music.Even now your living wheel turns o'er my head! Ye, as ye pass, toss high the desart sands, That roar and whiten, like a burst of waters, A sweet appearance, but a dread illusion To the parch'd caravan that roams by night! And ye upbuild on the becalmed waves That whirling pillar, which from earth to heaven Stands vast, and moves in blackness! Ye too split The ice mount! and with fragments many and huge Tempest the new-thaw'd sea, whose sudden gulfs Suck in, perchance, some Lapland wizard's skiff! Then round and round the whirlpool's marge ye dance, Till from the blue swoln corse the soul toils out, And joins your mighty army. [Here behind the scenes a voice sings the three words, ‘Hear, Sweet Spirit.’ Soul of Alvar! Hear the mild spell, and tempt no blacker charm! By sighs unquiet, and the sickly pang Of a half-dead, yet still undying hope, Pass visible before our mortal sense! So shall the Church's cleansing rites be thine, Her knells and masses that redeem the dead! Behind the Scenes, accompanied by the same Instrument as before.SONG Hear, sweet spirit, hear the spell, Lest a blacker charm compel! So shall the midnight breezes swell With thy deep long-lingering knell. And at evening evermore, In a chapel on the shore, Shall the chaunter, sad and saintly, Yellow tapers burning faintly, Doleful masses chaunt for thee, Miserere Domine! Hark! the cadence dies away On the quiet moonlight sea: The boatmen rest their oars and say, Miserere Domine! [A long pause. Ordonio. The innocent obey nor charm nor spell! My brother is in heaven. Thou sainted spirit, Burst on our sight, a passing visitant! Once more to hear thy voice, once more to see thee, O 'twere a joy to me! Alvar. A joy to thee! What if thou heard'st him now? What if his spirit Re-enter'd its cold corse, and came upon thee With many a stab from many a murderer's poniard? What (if his stedfast eye still beaming pity And brother's love) he turn'd his head aside, Lest he should look at thee, and with one look Hurl thee beyond all power of penitence? Valdez. These are unholy fancies! Ordonio. Yes, my father, He is in Heaven! Alvar (still to Ordonio). But what if he had a brother, Who had lived even so, that at his dying hour, The name of Heaven would have convulsed his face, More than the death-pang? Valdez. Idly prating man! Thou hast guess'd ill: Don Alvar's only brother Stands here before thee—a father's blessing on him! He is most virtuous. Alvar (still to Ordonio). What, if his very virtues Had pampered his swoln heart and made him proud? And what if pride had duped him into guilt? Yet still he stalked a self-created god, Not very bold, but exquisitely cunning; And one that at his mother's looking-glass Would force his features to a frowning sternness? Young Lord! I tell thee, that there are such beings— Yea, and it gives fierce merriment to the damn'd, To see these most proud men, that loath mankind, At every stir and buzz of coward conscience, Trick, cant, and lie, most whining hypocrites! Away, away! Now let me hear more music. [Music again. Teresa. 'Tis strange, I tremble at my own conjectures! But whatsoe'er it mean, I dare no longer Be present at these lawless mysteries, This dark provoking of the hidden Powers! Already I affront—if not high Heaven— Yet Alvar's memory!—Hark! I make appeal Against the unholy rite, and hasten hence To bend before a lawful shrine, and seek That voice which whispers, when the still heart listens, Comfort and faithful hope! Let us retire. Alvar (to Teresa). O full of faith and guileless love, thy Spirit Still prompts thee wisely. Let the pangs of guilt Surprise the guilty: thou art innocent! [Exeunt Teresa and Attendant. Music as before. The spell is mutter'd—Come, thou wandering shape, Who own'st no master in a human eye, Whate'er be this man's doom, fair be it, or foul, If he be dead, O come! and bring with thee That which he grasp'd in death! But if he live, Some token of his obscure perilous life. [The whole Music clashes into a Chorus. CHORUS Wandering demons, hear the spell! Lest a blacker charm compel— [The incense on the altar takes fire suddenly, and an illuminated picture of Alvar's assassination is discovered, and having remained a few seconds is then hidden by ascending flames. Ordonio (starting). Duped! duped! duped!—the traitor Isidore! [At this instant the doors are forced open, Monviedro and the Familiars of the Inquisition, Servants, &amp;c., enter and fill the stage. Monviedro. First seize the sorcerer! suffer him not to speak! The holy judges of the Inquisition Shall hear his first words.—Look you pale, Lord Valdez? Plain evidence have we here of most foul sorcery. There is a dungeon underneath this castle, And as you hope for mild interpretation, Surrender instantly the keys and charge of it. Ordonio (recovering himself as from stupor, to Servants). Why haste you not? Off with him to the dungeon! [All rush out in tumult. Scene II Interior of a Chapel, with painted Windows. Enter Teresa. Teresa. When first I entered this pure spot, forebodings Press'd heavy on my heart: but as I knelt, Such calm unwonted bliss possess'd my spirit, A trance so cloudless, that those sounds, hard by, Of trampling uproar fell upon mine ear As alien and unnoticed as the rain-storm Beats on the roof of some fair banquet-room, While sweetest melodies are warbling— Enter Valdez. Valdez. Ye pitying saints, forgive a father's blindness, And extricate us from this net of peril! Teresa. Who wakes anew my fears, and speaks of peril? Valdez. O best Teresa, wisely wert thou prompted! This was no feat of mortal agency! That picture—Oh, that picture tells me all! With a flash of light it came, in flames it vanished, Self-kindled, self-consum'd: bright as thy life, Sudden and unexpected as thy fate, Alvar! My son! My son!—The Inquisitor— Teresa. Torture me not! But Alvar—Oh of Alvar? Valdez. How often would he plead for these Morescoes! The brood accurst! remorseless, coward murderers! Teresa. So? so?—I comprehend you—He is— Valdez. He is no more! Teresa. O sorrow! that a father's voice should say this, A Father's Heart believe it! Valdez. A worse sorrow Are fancy's wild hopes to a heart despairing! Teresa. These rays that slant in through those gorgeous windows, From yon bright orb—though coloured as they pass, Are they not light?—Even so that voice, Lord Valdez! Which whispers to my soul, though haply varied By many a fancy, many a wishful hope, Speaks yet the truth: and Alvar lives for me! Valdez. Yes, for three wasting years, thus and no other, He has lived for thee—a spirit for thy spirit! My child, we must not give religious faith To every voice which makes the heart a listener To its own wish. Teresa. I breath'd to the Unerring Permitted prayers. Must those remain unanswer'd, Yet impious sorcery, that holds no commune Save with the lying spirit, claim belief? Valdez. O not to-day, not now for the first time Was Alvar lost to thee— Accurst assassins! Disarmed, o'erpowered, despairing of defence, At his bared breast he seem'd to grasp some relique More dear than was his life— Teresa. O Heavens! my portrait! And he did grasp it in his death pang! Off, false demon, That beat'st thy black wings close above my head! [Ordonio enters with the keys of the dungeon in his hand. Hush! who comes here? The wizard Moor's employer! Moors were his murderers, you say? Saints shield us From wicked thoughts— [Valdez moves towards the back of the stage to meet Ordonio, and during the concluding lines of Teresa's speech appears as eagerly conversing with him. Is Alvar dead? what then? The nuptial rites and funeral shall be one! Here's no abiding-place for thee, Teresa.— Away! they see me not—Thou seest me, Alvar! To thee I bend my course.—But first one question, One question to Ordonio.—My limbs tremble— There I may sit unmark'd—a moment will restore me. [Retires out of sight. Ordonio (as he advances with Valdez). These are the dungeon keys. Monviedro knew not, That I too had received the wizard's message, ‘He that can bring the dead to life again.’ But now he is satisfied, I plann'd this scheme To work a full conviction on the culprit, And he entrusts him wholly to my keeping. Valdez. 'Tis well, my son! But have you yet discovered (Where is Teresa?) what those speeches meant— Pride, and hypocrisy, and guilt, and cunning? Then when the wizard fix'd his eye on you, And you, I know not why, look'd pale and trembled— Why—why, what ails you now?— Ordonio. Me? what ails me? A pricking of the blood—It might have happen'd At any other time.—Why scan you me? Valdez. His speech about the corse, and stabs and murderers, Bore reference to the assassins— Ordonio. Dup'd! dup'd! dup'd! The traitor, Isidore! [A pause, then wildly. I tell thee, my dear father! I am most glad of this. Valdez. True—sorcery Merits its doom; and this perchance may guide us To the discovery of the murderers. I have their statures and their several faces So present to me, that but once to meet them Would be to recognize. Ordonio. Yes! yes! we recognize them. I was benumb'd, and staggered up and down Through darkness without light—dark—dark—dark! My flesh crept chill, my limbs felt manacled As had a snake coil'd round them!—Now 'tis sunshine, And the blood dances freely through its channels! [Then to himself. This is my virtuous, grateful Isidore! [Then mimicking Isidore's manner and voice. ‘A common trick of gratitude, my lord!’ Old Gratitude! a dagger would dissect His ‘own full heart’—'twere good to see its colour. Valdez. These magic sights! O that I ne'er had yielded To your entreaties! Neither had I yielded, But that in spite of your own seeming faith I held it for some innocent stratagem, Which love had prompted, to remove the doubts Of wild Teresa—by fancies quelling fancies! Ordonio. Love! love! and then we hate! and what? and wherefore? Hatred and love! fancies opposed by fancies! What? if one reptile sting another reptile? Where is the crime? The goodly face of nature Hath one disfeaturing stain the less upon it. Are we not all predestined transiency, And cold dishonour? Grant it, that this hand Had given a morsel to the hungry worms Somewhat too early—Where's the crime of this? That this must needs bring on the idiotcy Of moist-eyed penitence—'tis like a dream! Valdez. Wild talk, my son! But thy excess of feeling— Almost I fear it hath unhinged his brain. Ordonio (Teresa reappears and advances slowly). Say, I had laid a body in the sun! Well! in a month there swarm forth from the corse A thousand, nay, ten thousand sentient beings In place of that one man.—Say, I had kill'd him! [Teresa stops listening. Yet who shall tell me, that each one and all Of these ten thousand lives is not as happy, As that one life, which being push'd aside, Made room for these unnumbered— Valdez. O mere madness! [Teresa moves hastily forwards, and places herself directly before Ordonio. Ordonio. Teresa? or the phantom of Teresa? Teresa. Alas! the phantom only, if in truth The substance of her being, her life's life, Have ta'en its flight through Alvar's death-wound— [A pause. Where— (Even coward murder grants the dead a grave) O tell me, Valdez!—answer me, Ordonio! Where lies the corse of my betrothéd husband? Ordonio. There, where Ordonio likewise would fain lie! In the sleep-compelling earth, in unpierc'd darkness! For while we live— An inward day that never, never sets, Glares round the soul, and mocks the closing eyelids! Over his rocky grave the fir-grove sighs A lulling ceaseless dirge! 'Tis well with him. [Strides off towards the altar, but returns as Valdez is speaking. Teresa. The rock! the fir-grove! [To Valdez. Did'st thou hear him say it? Hush! I will ask him! Valdez. Urge him not—not now! This we beheld. Nor he nor I know more, Than what the magic imagery revealed. The assassin, who pressed foremost of the three— Ordonio. A tender-hearted, scrupulous, grateful villain, Whom I will strangle! Valdez. While his two companions— Ordonio. Dead! dead already! what care we for the dead? Valdez (to Teresa). Pity him! soothe him! disenchant his spirit! These supernatural shews, this strange disclosure, And this too fond affection, which still broods O'er Alvar's fate, and still burns to avenge it— These, struggling with his hopeless love for you, Distemper him, and give reality To the creatures of his fancy. Ordonio. Is it so? Yes! yes! even like a child, that too abruptly Roused by a glare of light from deepest sleep Starts up bewildered and talks idly. Father! What if the Moors that made my brother's grave, Even now were digging ours? What if the bolt, Though aim'd, I doubt not, at the son of Valdez, Yet miss'd its true aim when it fell on Alvar? Valdez. Alvar ne'er fought against the Moors,—say rather, He was their advocate; but you had march'd With fire and desolation through their villages.— Yet he by chance was captured. Ordonio. Unknown, perhaps, Captured, yet as the son of Valdez, murdered. Leave all to me. Nay, whither, gentle lady? Valdez. What seek you now? Teresa. A better, surer light To guide me— Both Valdez and Ordonio. Whither? Teresa. To the only place Where life yet dwells for me, and ease of heart. These walls seem threatening to fall in upon me! Detain me not! a dim power drives me hence, And that will be my guide. Valdez. To find a lover! Suits that a high-born maiden's modesty? O folly and shame! Tempt not my rage, Teresa! Teresa. Hopeless, I fear no human being's rage. And am I hastening to the arms—O Heaven! I haste but to the grave of my belov'd! [Exit, Valdez following after her. Ordonio. This, then, is my reward! and I must love her? Scorn'd! shudder'd at! yet love her still? yes! yes! By the deep feelings of revenge and hate I will still love her—woo her—win her too! [A pause. Isidore safe and silent, and the portrait Found on the wizard—he, belike, self-poison'd To escape the crueller flames—My soul shouts triumph! The mine is undermined! blood! blood! blood! They thirst for thy blood! thy blood, Ordonio! [A pause. The hunt is up! and in the midnight wood With lights to dazzle and with nets they seek A timid prey: and lo! the tiger's eye Glares in the red flame of his hunter's torch! To Isidore I will dispatch a message, And lure him to the cavern! aye, that cavern! He cannot fail to find it. Thither I'll lure him, Whence he shall never, never more return! [Looks through the side window. A rim of the sun lies yet upon the sea, And now 'tis gone! All shall be done to-night. [Exit. ACT IV Scene I A cavern, dark, except where a gleam of moonlight is seen on one side at the further end of it; supposed to be cast on it from a crevice in a part of the cavern out of sight. Isidore alone, an extinguished torch in his hand. Isidore. Faith 'twas a moving letter—very moving! ‘His life in danger, no place safe but this! 'Twas his turn now to talk of gratitude.’ And yet—but no! there can't be such a villain. It can not be! Thanks to that little crevice, Which lets the moonlight in! I'll go and sit by it. To peep at a tree, or see a he-goat's beard, Or hear a cow or two breathe loud in their sleep— Any thing but this crash of water drops! These dull abortive sounds that fret the silence With puny thwartings and mock opposition! So beats the death-watch to a sick man's ear. [He goes out of sight, opposite to the patch of moonlight: and returns. A hellish pit! The very same I dreamt of! I was just in—and those damn'd fingers of ice Which clutch'd my hair up! Ha!—what's that—it mov'd. [Isidore stands staring at another recess in the cavern. In the mean time Ordonio enters with a torch, and halloes to Isidore. Isidore. I swear that I saw something moving there! The moonshine came and went like a flash of lightning— I swear, I saw it move. Ordonio (goes into the recess, then returns). A jutting clay stone Drops on the long lank weed, that grows beneath: And the weed nods and drips. Isidore. A jest to laugh at! It was not that which scar'd me, good my lord. Ordonio. What scar'd you, then? Isidore. You see that little rift? But first permit me! [Lights his torch at Ordonio's, and while lighting it. (A lighted torch in the hand Is no unpleasant object here—one's breath Floats round the flame, and makes as many colours As the thin clouds that travel near the moon.) You see that crevice there? My torch extinguished by these water-drops, And marking that the moonlight came from thence, I stept in to it, meaning to sit there; But scarcely had I measured twenty paces— My body bending forward, yea, o'erbalanced Almost beyond recoil, on the dim brink Of a huge chasm I stept. The shadowy moonshine Filling the void so counterfeited substance, That my foot hung aslant adown the edge. Was it my own fear? Fear too hath its instincts! (And yet such dens as these are wildly told of, And there are beings that live, yet not for the eye) An arm of frost above and from behind me Pluck'd up and snatched me backward. Merciful Heaven! You smile! alas, even smiles look ghastly here! My lord, I pray you, go yourself and view it. Ordonio. It must have shot some pleasant feelings through you. Isidore. If every atom of a dead man's flesh Should creep, each one with a particular life, Yet all as cold as ever—'twas just so! Or had it drizzled needle-points of frost Upon a feverish head made suddenly bald— Ordonio. Why, Isidore, I blush for thy cowardice. It might have startled, I grant you, even a brave man for a moment— But such a panic— Isidore. When a boy, my lord! I could have sate whole hours beside that chasm, Push'd in huge stones and heard them strike and rattle Against its horrid sides: then hung my head Low down, and listened till the heavy fragments Sank with faint crash in that still groaning well, Which never thirsty pilgrim blest, which never A living thing came near—unless, perchance, Some blind-worm battens on the ropy mould Close at its edge. Ordonio. Art thou more coward now? Isidore. Call him, that fears his fellow-man, a coward! I fear not man—but this inhuman cavern, It were too bad a prison-house for goblins. Beside, (you'll smile, my lord) but true it is, My last night's sleep was very sorely haunted By what had passed between us in the morning. O sleep of horrors! Now run down and stared at By forms so hideous that they mock remembrance— Now seeing nothing and imagining nothing, But only being afraid—stifled with fear! While every goodly or familiar form Had a strange power of breathing terror round me! I saw you in a thousand fearful shapes; And, I entreat your lordship to believe me, In my last dream— Ordonio. Well? Isidore. I was in the act Of falling down that chasm, when Alhadra Wak'd me: she heard my heart beat. Ordonio. Strange enough! Had you been here before? Isidore. Never, my lord! But mine eyes do not see it now more clearly, Than in my dream I saw—that very chasm. Ordonio (after a pause). I know not why it should be! yet it is— Isidore. What is, my lord? Ordonio. Abhorrent from our nature To kill a man.— Isidore. Except in self-defence. Ordonio. Why that's my case; and yet the soul recoils from it— 'Tis so with me at least. But you, perhaps, Have sterner feelings? Isidore. Something troubles you. How shall I serve you? By the life you gave me, By all that makes that life of value to me, My wife, my babes, my honour, I swear to you, Name it, and I will toil to do the thing, If it be innocent! But this, my lord! Is not a place where you could perpetrate, No, nor propose a wicked thing. The darkness, When ten strides off we know 'tis cheerful moonlight, Collects the guilt, and crowds it round the heart. It must be innocent. Ordonio. Thyself be judge. One of our family knew this place well. Isidore. Who? when? my lord? Ordonio. What boots it, who or when? Hang up thy torch—I'll tell his tale to thee. [They hang up their torches on some ridge in the cavern. He was a man different from other men, And he despised them, yet revered himself. Isidore (aside). He? He despised? Thou'rt speaking of thyself! I am on my guard, however: no surprise. [Then to Ordonio. What, he was mad? Ordonio. All men seemed mad to him! Nature had made him for some other planet, And pressed his soul into a human shape By accident or malice. In this world He found no fit companion. Isidore. Of himself he speaks. [Aside. Alas! poor wretch! Mad men are mostly proud. Ordonio. He walked alone, And phantom thoughts unsought-for troubled him. Something within would still be shadowing out All possibilities; and with these shadows His mind held dalliance. Once, as so it happened, A fancy crossed him wilder than the rest: To this in moody murmur and low voice He yielded utterance, as some talk in sleep: The man who heard him.— Why did'st thou look round? Isidore. I have a prattler three years old, my lord! In truth he is my darling. As I went From forth my door, he made a moan in sleep— But I am talking idly—pray proceed! And what did this man? Ordonio. With this human hand He gave a substance and reality To that wild fancy of a possible thing.— Well it was done! Why babblest thou of guilt? The deed was done, and it passed fairly off. And he whose tale I tell thee—dost thou listen? Isidore. I would, my lord, you were by my fire-side, I'd listen to you with an eager eye, Though you began this cloudy tale at midnight, But I do listen—pray proceed, my lord. Ordonio. Where was I? Isidore. He of whom you tell the tale— Ordonio. Surveying all things with a quiet scorn, Tamed himself down to living purposes, The occupations and the semblances Of ordinary men—and such he seemed! But that same over ready agent—he— Isidore. Ah! what of him, my lord? Ordonio. He proved a traitor, Betrayed the mystery to a brother-traitor, And they between them hatch'd a damnéd plot To hunt him down to infamy and death. What did the Valdez? I am proud of the name Since he dared do it.— [Ordonio grasps his sword, and turns off from Isidore, then after a pause returns. Our links burn dimly. Isidore. A dark tale darkly finished! Nay, my lord! Tell what he did. Ordonio. That which his wisdom prompted— He made the traitor meet him in this cavern, And here he kill'd the traitor. Isidore. No! the fool! He had not wit enough to be a traitor. Poor thick-eyed beetle! not to have foreseen That he who gulled thee with a whimpered lie To murder his own brother, would not scruple To murder thee, if e'er his guilt grew jealous, And he could steal upon thee in the dark! Ordonio. Thou would'st not then have come, if— Isidore. Oh yes, my lord! I would have met him arm'd, and scar'd the coward. [Isidore throws off his robe; shews himself armed, and draws his sword. Ordonio. Now this is excellent and warms the blood! My heart was drawing back, drawing me back With weak and womanish scruples. Now my vengeance Beckons me onwards with a warrior's mien, And claims that life, my pity robb'd her of— Now will I kill thee, thankless slave, and count it Among my comfortable thoughts hereafter. Isidore. And all my little ones fatherless— Die thou first. [They fight, Ordonio disarms Isidore, and in disarming him throws his sword up that recess opposite to which they were standing. Isidore hurries into the recess with his torch, Ordonio follows him; a loud cry of ‘Traitor! Monster!’ is heard from the cavern, and in a moment Ordonio returns alone. Ordonio. I have hurl'd him down the chasm! treason for treason. He dreamt of it: henceforward let him sleep, A dreamless sleep, from which no wife can wake him. His dream too is made out—Now for his friend. [Exit Ordonio. Scene II The interior Court of a Saracenic or Gothic Castle, with the Iron Gate of a Dungeon visible. Teresa. Heart-chilling superstition! thou canst glaze Ev'n pity's eye with her own frozen tear. In vain I urge the tortures that await him; Even Selma, reverend guardian of my childhood, My second mother, shuts her heart against me! Well, I have won from her what most imports The present need, this secret of the dungeon Known only to herself.—A Moor! a Sorcerer! No, I have faith, that Nature ne'er permitted Baseness to wear a form so noble. True, I doubt not that Ordonio had suborned him To act some part in some unholy fraud; As little doubt, that for some unknown purpose He hath baffled his suborner, terror-struck him, And that Ordonio meditates revenge! But my resolve is fixed! myself will rescue him, And learn if haply he knew aught of Alvar. Enter Valdez. Valdez. Still sad?—and gazing at the massive door Of that fell dungeon which thou ne'er had'st sight of, Save what, perchance, thy infant fancy shap'd it When the nurse still'd thy cries with unmeant threats. Now by my faith, girl! this same wizard haunts thee! A stately man, and eloquent and tender— Who then need wonder if a lady sighs Even at the thought of what these stern Dominicans— Teresa. The horror of their ghastly punishments Doth so o'ertop the height of all compassion, That I should feel too little for mine enemy, If it were possible I could feel more, Even though the dearest inmates of our household Were doom'd to suffer them. That such things are— Valdez. Hush, thoughtless woman! Teresa. Nay, it wakes within me More than a woman's spirit. Valdez. No more of this— What if Monviedro or his creatures hear us! I dare not listen to you. Teresa. My honoured lord, These were my Alvar's lessons, and whene'er I bend me o'er his portrait, I repeat them, As if to give a voice to the mute image. Valdez. —We have mourned for Alvar. Of his sad fate there now remains no doubt. Have I no other son? Teresa. Speak not of him! That low imposture! That mysterious picture! If this be madness, must I wed a madman? And if not madness, there is mystery, And guilt doth lurk behind it. Valdez. Is this well? Teresa. Yes, it is truth: saw you his countenance? How rage, remorse, and scorn, and stupid fear Displaced each other with swift interchanges? O that I had indeed the sorcerer's power.— I would call up before thine eyes the image Of my betrothéd Alvar, of thy first-born! His own fáir countenance, his kingly forehead, His tender smiles, love's day-dawn on his lips! That spiritual and almost heavenly light In his commanding eye—his mien heroic, Virtue's own native heraldry! to man Genial, and pleasant to his guardian angel. Whene'er he gladden'd, how the gladness spread Wide round him! and when oft with swelling tears, Flash'd through by indignation, he bewail'd The wrongs of Belgium's martyr'd patriots, Oh, what a grief was there—for joy to envy, Or gaze upon enamour'd! O my father! Recall that morning when we knelt together, And thou didst bless our loves! O even now, Even now, my sire! to thy mind's eye present him, As at that moment he rose up before thee, Stately, with beaming look! Place, place beside him Ordonio's dark perturbéd countenance! Then bid me (Oh thou could'st not) bid me turn From him, the joy, the triumph of our kind! To take in exchange that brooding man, who never Lifts up his eye from the earth, unless to scowl. Valdez. Ungrateful woman! I have tried to stifle An old man's passion! was it not enough, That thou hast made my son a restless man, Banish'd his health, and half unhing'd his reason; But that thou wilt insult him with suspicion? And toil to blast his honour? I am old, A comfortless old man! Teresa. O grief! to hear Hateful entreaties from a voice we love! Enter a Peasant and presents a letter to Valdez. Valdez (reading it). ‘He dares not venture hither!’ Why, what can this mean? ‘Lest the Familiars of the Inquisition, That watch around my gates, should intercept him; But he conjures me, that without delay I hasten to him—for my own sake entreats me To guard from danger him I hold imprison'd— He will reveal a secret, the joy of which Will even outweigh the sorrow.’—Why what can this be? Perchance it is some Moorish stratagem, To have in me a hostage for his safety. Nay, that they dare not! Ho! collect my servants! I will go thither—let them arm themselves. [Exit Valdez. Teresa (alone). The moon is high in heaven, and all is hush'd, Yet anxious listener! I have seem'd to hear A low dead thunder mutter thro' the night, As 'twere a giant angry in his sleep. O Alvar! Alvar! that they could return, Those blessed days that imitated heaven, When we two wont to walk at eventide; When we saw nought but beauty; when we heard The voice of that Almighty One who loved us In every gale that breathed, and wave that murmur'd! O we have listen'd, even till high-wrought pleasure Hath half assumed the countenance of grief, And the deep sigh seemed to heave up a weight Of bliss, that pressed too heavy on the heart. [A pause. And this majestic Moor, seems he not one Who oft and long communing with my Alvar Hath drunk in kindred lustre from his presence, And guides me to him with reflected light? What if in yon dark dungeon coward treachery Be groping for him with envenomed poniard— Hence, womanish fears, traitors to love and duty— I'll free him. [Exit Teresa. Scene III The mountains by moonlight. Alhadra alone in a Moorish dress. Alhadra. Yon hanging woods, that touch'd by autumn seem As they were blossoming hues of fire and gold The flower-like woods, most lovely in decay, The many clouds, the sea, the rock, the sands, Lie in the silent moonshine: and the owl, (Strange! very strange!) the screech-owl only wakes! Sole voice, sole eye of all this world of beauty! Unless, perhaps, she sing her screeching song To a herd of wolves, that skulk athirst for blood. Why such a thing am I?—Where are these men? I need the sympathy of human faces, To beat away this deep contempt for all things, Which quenches my revenge. O! would to Alla, The raven, or the sea-mew, were appointed To bring me food! or rather that my soul Could drink in life from the universal air! It were a lot divine in some small skiff Along some Ocean's boundless solitude, To float for ever with a careless course, And think myself the only being alive! My children!—Isidore's children!—Son of Valdez, This hath new strung mine arm. Thou coward tyrant! To stupify a woman's heart with anguish Till she forgot—even that she was a mother! [She fixes her eye on the earth. Then drop in one after another, from different parts of the stage, a considerable number of Morescoes, all in Moorish garments and Moorish armour. They form a circle at a distance round Alhadra, and remain silent till Naomi enters. Naomi. Woman! May Alla and the Prophet bless thee! We have obeyed thy call. Where is our chief? And why didst thou enjoin these Moorish garments? Alhadra (raising her eyes, and looking round on the circle). Warriors of Mahomet! faithful in the battle! My countrymen! Come ye prepared to work An honourable deed? And would ye work it In the slave's garb? Curse on those Christian robes! They are spell-blasted: and whoever wears them, His arm shrinks wither'd, his heart melts away, And his bones soften. Naomi. Where is Isidore? Alhadra. This night I went from forth my house, and left His children all asleep: and he was living! And I return'd and found them still asleep, But he had perished— All Morescoes. Perished? Alhadra. He had perished! Sleep on, poor babes! not one of you doth know That he is fatherless—a desolate orphan! Why should we wake them? Can an infant's arm Revenge his murder? One Moresco (to another). Did she say his murder? Naomi. Murder? Not murdered? Alhadra. Murdered by a Christian! [They all at once draw their sabres. Alhadra (to Naomi, who advances from the circle). Brother of Zagri! fling away thy sword; This is thy chieftain's! [He steps forward to take it. Dost thou dare receive it? For I have sworn by Alla and the Prophet, No tear shall dim these eyes, this woman's heart Shall heave no groan, till I have seen that sword Wet with the life-blood of the son of Valdez! [A pause. Ordonio was your chieftain's murderer! Naomi. He dies, by Alla! All (kneeling). By Alla! Alhadra. This night your chieftain armed himself, And hurried from me. But I followed him At distance, till I saw him enter—there! Naomi. The cavern? Alhadra. Yes, the mouth of yonder cavern After a while I saw the son of Valdez Rush by with flaring torch; he likewise entered. There was another and a longer pause; And once, methought I heard the clash of swords! And soon the son of Valdez re-appeared: He flung his torch towards the moon in sport, And seemed as he were mirthful! I stood listening, Impatient for the footsteps of my husband! Naomi. Thou called'st him? Alhadra. I crept into the cavern— 'Twas dark and very silent. What said'st thou? No! no! I did not dare call, Isidore, Lest I should hear no answer! A brief while, Belike, I lost all thought and memory Of that for which I came! After that pause. O Heaven! I heard a groan, and followed it: And yet another groan, which guided me Into a strange recess—and there was light, A hideous light! his torch lay on the ground; Its flame burnt dimly o'er a chasm's brink: I spake; and whilst I spake, a feeble groan Came from that chasm! it was his last! his death-groan! Naomi. Comfort her, Alla! Alhadra. I stood in unimaginable trance And agony that cannot be remembered, Listening with horrid hope to hear a groan! But I had heard his last: my husband's death-groan! Naomi. Haste! let us onward. Alhadra. I looked far down the pit— My sight was bounded by a jutting fragment: And it was stained with blood. Then first I shrieked, My eye-balls burnt, my brain grew hot as fire, And all the hanging drops of the wet roof Turned into blood—I saw them turn to blood! And I was leaping wildly down the chasm, When on the farther brink I saw his sword, And it said, Vengeance!—Curses on my tongue! The moon hath moved in Heaven, and I am here, And he hath not had vengeance! Isidore! Spirit of Isidore! thy murderer lives! Away! away! All. Away! away! [She rushes off, all following her. ACT V Scene I A Dungeon. Alvar (alone) rises slowly from a bed of reeds. Alvar. And this place my forefathers made for man! This is the process of our love and wisdom To each poor brother who offends against us— Most innocent, perhaps—and what if guilty? Is this the only cure? Merciful God! Each pore and natural outlet shrivelled up By ignorance and parching poverty, His energies roll back upon his heart, And stagnate and corrupt, till, chang'd to poison, They break out on him, like a loathsome plague-spot! Then we call in our pampered mountebanks: And this is their best cure! uncomforted And friendless solitude, groaning and tears, And savage faces, at the clanking hour, Seen through the steam and vapours of his dungeon By the lamp's dismal twilight! So he lies Circled with evil, till his very soul Unmoulds its essence, hopelessly deformed By sights of evermore deformity! With other ministrations thou, O Nature! Healest thy wandering and distempered child: Thou pourest on him thy soft influences, Thy sunny hues, fair forms, and breathing sweets; Thy melodies of woods, and winds, and waters! Till he relent, and can no more endure To be a jarring and a dissonant thing Amid this general dance and minstrelsy; But, bursting into tears, wins back his way, His angry spirit healed and harmonized By the benignant touch of love and beauty. I am chill and weary! Yon rude bench of stone, In that dark angle, the sole resting-place! But the self-approving mind is its own light And life's best warmth still radiates from the heart Where love sits brooding, and an honest purpose. [Retires out of sight. Enter Teresa with a taper. Teresa. It has chilled my very life—my own voice scares me; Yet when I hear it not I seem to lose The substance of my being—my strongest grasp Sends inwards but weak witness that I am. I seek to cheat the echo.—How the half sounds Blend with this strangled light! Is he not here— [Looking round. O for one human face here—but to see One human face here to sustain me.—Courage! It is but my own fear! The life within me, It sinks and wavers like this cone of flame, Beyond which I scarce dare look onward! Oh! If I faint? If this inhuman den should be At once my death-bed and my burial vault? [Faintly screams as Alvar emerges from the recess. Alvar (rushes towards her, and catches her as she is falling). O gracious heaven! it is, it is Teresa! Shall I reveal myself? The sudden shock Of rapture will blow out this spark of life, And joy complete what terror has begun. O ye impetuous beatings here, be still! Teresa, best beloved! pale, pale, and cold! Her pulse doth flutter! Teresa! my Teresa! Teresa (recovering). I heard a voice; but often in my dreams I hear that voice! and wake and try—and try— To hear it waking! but I never could— And 'tis so now—even so! Well! he is dead— Murdered perhaps! and I am faint, and feel As if it were no painful thing to die! Alvar. Believe it not, sweet maid! Believe it not, Belovéd woman! 'Twas a low imposture Framed by a guilty wretch. Teresa. Ha! Who art thou? Alvar. Suborned by his brother— Teresa. Didst thou murder him? And dost thou now repent? Poor troubled man, I do forgive thee, and may Heaven forgive thee! Alvar. Ordonio—he— Teresa. If thou didst murder him— His spirit ever at the throne of God Asks mercy for thee: prays for mercy for thee, With tears in Heaven! Alvar. Alvar was not murdered. Be calm! Be calm, sweet maid! Teresa. Nay, nay, but tell me! [A pause. O 'tis lost again! This dull confuséd pain— [A pause. Mysterious man! Methinks I can not fear thee: for thine eye Doth swim with love and pity—Well! Ordonio— Oh my foreboding heart! And he suborned thee, And thou didst spare his life? Blessings shower on thee, As many as the drops twice counted o'er In the fond faithful heart of his Teresa! Alvar. I can endure no more. The Moorish sorcerer Exists but in the stain upon his face. That picture— Teresa. Ha! speak on! Alvar. Beloved Teresa! It told but half the truth. O let this portrait Tell all—that Alvar lives—that he is here! Thy much deceived but ever faithful Alvar. [Takes her portrait from his neck, and gives it her. Teresa (receiving the portrait). The same—it is the same! Ah! Who art thou? Nay, I will call thee, Alvar! [She falls on his neck. Alvar. O joy unutterable! But hark! a sound as of removing bars At the dungeon's outer door. A brief, brief while Conceal thyself, my love! It is Ordonio. For the honour of our race, for our dear father; O for himself too (he is still my brother) Let me recall him to his nobler nature, That he may wake as from a dream of murder! O let me reconcile him to himself, Open the sacred source of penitent tears, And be once more his own beloved Alvar. Teresa. O my all virtuous love! I fear to leave thee With that obdurate man. Alvar. Thou dost not leave me! But a brief while retire into the darkness: O that my joy could spread its sunshine round thee! Teresa. The sound of thy voice shall be my music! Alvar! my Alvar! am I sure I hold thee? Is it no dream? thee in my arms, my Alvar! [Exit. [A noise at the Dungeon door. It opens, and Ordonio enters, with a goblet in his hand. Ordonio. Hail, potent wizard! in my gayer mood I poured forth a libation to old Pluto, And as I brimmed the bowl, I thought on thee. Thou hast conspired against my life and honour, Hast tricked me foully; yet I hate thee not. Why should I hate thee? this same world of ours, 'Tis but a pool amid a storm of rain, And we the air-bladders that course up and down, And joust and tilt in merry tournament; And when one bubble runs foul of another, The weaker needs must break. Alvar. I see thy heart! There is a frightful glitter in thine eye Which doth betray thee. Inly-tortured man, This is the revelry of a drunken anguish, Which fain would scoff away the pang of guilt, And quell each human feeling. Ordonio. Feeling! feeling! The death of a man—the breaking of a bubble— 'Tis true I cannot sob for such misfortunes; But faintness, cold and hunger—curses on me If willingly I e'er inflicted them! Come, take the beverage; this chill place demands it. [Ordonio proffers the goblet. Alvar. Yon insect on the wall, Which moves this way and that its hundred limbs, Were it a toy of mere mechanic craft, It were an infinitely curious thing! But it has life, Ordonio! life, enjoyment! And by the power of its miraculous will Wields all the complex movements of its frame Unerringly to pleasurable ends! Saw I that insect on this goblet's brim I would remove it with an anxious pity! Ordonio. What meanest thou? Alvar. There's poison in the wine. Ordonio. Thou hast guessed right; there's poison in the wine. There's poison in't—which of us two shall drink it? For one of us must die! Alvar. Whom dost thou think me? Ordonio. The accomplice and sworn friend of Isidore. Alvar. I know him not. And yet methinks, I have heard the name but lately. Means he the husband of the Moorish woman? Isidore? Isidore? Ordonio. Good! good! that lie! by heaven it has restored me. Now I am thy master!—Villain! thou shalt drink it, Or die a bitterer death. Alvar. What strange solution Hast thou found out to satisfy thy fears, And drug them to unnatural sleep? [Alvar takes the goblet, and throws it to the ground. My master! Ordonio. Thou mountebank! Alvar. Mountebank and villain! What then art thou? For shame, put up thy sword! What boots a weapon in a withered arm? I fix mine eye upon thee, and thou tremblest! I speak, and fear and wonder crush thy rage, And turn it to a motionless distraction! Thou blind self-worshipper! thy pride, thy cunning, Thy faith in universal villainy, Thy shallow sophisms, thy pretended scorn For all thy human brethren—out upon them! What have they done for thee? have they given thee peace? Cured thee of starting in thy sleep? or made The darkness pleasant when thou wak'st at midnight? Art happy when alone? Can'st walk by thyself With even step and quiet cheerfulness? Yet, yet thou may'st be saved— Ordonio. Saved? saved? Alvar. One pang! Could I call up one pang of true remorse! Ordonio. He told me of the babes that prattled to him, His fatherless little ones! remorse! remorse! Where got'st thou that fool's word? Curse on remorse! Can it give up the dead, or recompact A mangled body? mangled—dashed to atoms! Not all the blessings of a host of angels Can blow away a desolate widow's curse! And though thou spill thy heart's blood for atonement, It will not weigh against an orphan's tear! Alvar. But Alvar— Ordonio. Ha! it chokes thee in the throat, Even thee; and yet I pray thee speak it out. Still Alvar!—Alvar!—howl it in mine ear! Heap it like coals of fire upon my heart, And shoot it hissing through my brain! Alvar. Alas! That day when thou didst leap from off the rock Into the waves, and grasped thy sinking brother, And bore him to the strand; then, son of Valdez, How sweet and musical the name of Alvar! Then, then, Ordonio, he was dear to thee, And thou wert dear to him: heaven only knows How very dear thou wert! Why did'st thou hate him! O heaven! how he would fall upon thy neck, And weep forgiveness! Ordonio. Spirit of the dead! Methinks I know thee! ha! my brain turns wild At its own dreams!—off—off, fantastic shadow! Alvar. I fain would tell thee what I am, but dare not! Ordonio. Cheat! villain! traitor! whatsoever thou be— I fear thee, man! Teresa (rushing out and falling on Alvar's neck). Ordonio! 'tis thy brother! [Ordonio runs upon Alvar with his sword. Teresa flings herself on Ordonio and arrests his arm. Stop, madman, stop! Alvar. Does then this thin disguise impenetrably Hide Alvar from thee? Toil and painful wounds And long imprisonment in unwholesome dungeons, Have marred perhaps all trait and lineament Of what I was! But chiefly, chiefly, brother, My anguish for thy guilt! Ordonio—Brother! Nay, nay, thou shalt embrace me. Ordonio (drawing back, and gazing at Alvar). Touch me not! Touch not pollution, Alvar! I will die. [He attempts to fall on his sword, Alvar and Teresa prevent him. Alvar. We will find means to save your honour. Live, Oh live, Ordonio! for our father's sake! Spare his grey hairs! Teresa. And you may yet be happy. Ordonio. O horror! not a thousand years in heaven Could recompose this miserable heart, Or make it capable of one brief joy! Live! live! Why yes! 'Twere well to live with you: For is it fit a villain should be proud? My brother! I will kneel to you, my brother! [Kneeling. Forgive me, Alvar!—Curse me with forgiveness! Alvar. Call back thy soul, Ordonio, and look round thee! Now is the time for greatness! Think that heaven— Teresa. O mark his eye! he hears not what you say. Ordonio. Yes, mark his eye! there's fascination in it! Thou said'st thou did'st not know him—That is he! He comes upon me! Alvar. Heal, O heal him, heaven! Ordonio. Nearer and nearer! and I can not stir! Will no one hear these stifled groans, and wake me? He would have died to save me, and I killed him— A husband and a father!— Teresa. Some secret poison Drinks up his spirits! Ordonio. Let the eternal justice Prepare my punishment in the obscure world— I will not bear to live—to live—O agony! And be myself alone my own sore torment! [The doors of the dungeon are broken open, and in rush Alhadra, and the band of Morescoes. Alhadra. Seize first that man! [Alvar. presses onward to defend Ordonio. Ordonio. Off, ruffians! I have flung away my sword. Woman, my life is thine! to thee I give it! Off! he that touches me with his hand of flesh, I'll rend his limbs asunder! I have strength With this bare arm to scatter you like ashes. Alhadra. My husband— Ordonio. Yes, I murdered him most foully. Alvar and Teresa. O horrible! Alhadra. Why did'st thou leave his children? Demon, thou should'st have sent thy dogs of hell To lap their blood. Then, then I might have hardened My soul in misery, and have had comfort. I would have stood far off, quiet though dark, And bade the race of men raise up a mourning For a deep horror of desolation, Too great to be one soul's particular lot! Brother of Zagri! let me lean upon thee. The time is not yet come for woman's anguish, I have not seen his blood—Within an hour Those little ones will crowd around and ask me, Where is our father? I shall curse thee then! Wert thou in heaven, my curse would pluck thee thence! Teresa. He doth repent! See, see, I kneel to thee! O let him live! That agéd man, his father— Alhadra. Why had he such a son? [Shouts from the distance of Rescue! Rescue! Alvar! Alvar! and the voice of Valdez heard. Rescue?—and Isidore's spirit unavenged?— The deed be mine! [Suddenly stabs Ordonio. Now take my life! Ordonio (staggering from the wound). Atonement! Alvar (while with Teresa supporting Ordonio). Arm of avenging Heaven Thou hast snatched from me my most cherished hope— But go! my word was pledged to thee. Ordonio. Away! Brave not my Father's rage! I thank thee! Thou— [Then turning his eyes languidly to Alvar. She hath avenged the blood of Isidore! I stood in silence like a slave before her That I might taste the wormwood and the gall, And satiate this self-accusing heart With bitterer agonies than death can give. Forgive me, Alvar! Oh!—could'st thou forget me! [Dies. [Alvar and Teresa bend over the body of Ordonio. Alhadra (to the Moors). I thank thee, Heaven! thou hast ordained it wisely, That still extremes bring their own cure. That point In misery, which makes the oppressed Man Regardless of his own life, makes him too Lord of the Oppressor's—Knew I a hundred men Despairing, but not palsied by despair, This arm should shake the kingdoms of the world; The deep foundations of iniquity Should sink away, earth groaning from beneath them; The strongholds of the cruel men should fall, Their temples and their mountainous towers should fall; Till desolation seemed a beautiful thing, And all that were and had the spirit of life, Sang a new song to her who had gone forth, Conquering and still to conquer! [Alhadra hurries off with the Moors; the stage fills with armed Peasants, and Servants, Zulimez and Valdez at their head. Valdez rushes into Alvar's arms. Alvar. Turn not thy face that way, my father! hide, Oh hide it from his eye! Oh let thy joy Flow in unmingled stream through thy first blessing. [Both kneel to Valdez. Valdez. My Son! My Alvar! bless, Oh bless him, heaven! Teresa. Me too, my Father? Valdez. Bless, Oh bless my children! [Both rise. Alvar. Delights so full, if unalloyed with grief, Were ominous. In these strange dread events Just Heaven instructs us with an awful voice, That Conscience rules us e'en against our choice. Our inward Monitress to guide or warn, If listened to; but if repelled with scorn, At length as dire Remorse, she reappears, Works in our guilty hopes, and selfish fears! Still bids, Remember! and still cries, Too late! And while she scares us, goads us to our fate. APPENDIX The following Scene, as unfit for the stage, was taken from the tragedy, in the year 1797, and published in the Lyrical Ballads. [1798, pp. 28-31: vide ante, pp. 182-4.] Enter Teresa and Selma. Teresa. 'Tis said, he spake of you familiarly, As mine and Alvar's common foster-mother. Selma. Now blessings on the man, whoe'er he be That joined your names with mine! O my sweet Lady, As often as I think of those dear times, When you two little ones would stand, at eve, On each side of my chair, and make me learn All you had learnt in the day; and how to talk In gentle phrase; then bid me sing to you— 'Tis more like heaven to come, than what has been! Teresa. But that entrance, Selma? Selma. Can no one hear? It is a perilous tale! Teresa. No one. Selma. My husband's father told it me, Poor old Sesina—angels rest his soul; He was a woodman, and could fell and saw With lusty arm. You know that huge round beam Which props the hanging wall of the old chapel? Beneath that tree, while yet it was a tree, He found a baby wrapt in mosses, lined With thistle-beards, and such small locks of wool As hang on brambles. Well, he brought him home, And reared him at the then Lord Valdez' cost. And so the babe grew up a pretty boy, A pretty boy, but most unteachable— And never learn'd a prayer, nor told a bead, But knew the names of birds, and mocked their notes, And whistled, as he were a bird himself. And all the autumn 'twas his only play To gather seeds of wild flowers, and to plant them With earth and water on the stumps of trees. A Friar, who gathered simples in the wood, A grey-haired man, he loved this little boy: The boy loved him, and, when the friar taught him, He soon could write with the pen; and from that time Lived chiefly at the convent or the castle. So he became a rare and learned youth: But O! poor wretch! he read, and read, and read, Till his brain turned; and ere his twentieth year He had unlawful thoughts of many things: And though he prayed, he never loved to pray With holy men, nor in a holy place. But yet his speech, it was so soft and sweet, The late Lord Valdez ne'er was wearied with him. And once, as by the north side of the chapel They stood together chained in deep discourse, The earth heaved under them with such a groan, That the wall tottered, and had well nigh fallen Right on their heads. My Lord was sorely frightened; A fever seized him, and he made confession Of all the heretical and lawless talk Which brought this judgment: so the youth was seized, And cast into that hole. My husband's father Sobbed like a child—it almost broke his heart: And once he was working near this dungeon, He heard a voice distinctly; 'twas the youth's, Who sung a doleful song about green fields, How sweet it were on lake or wide savanna To hunt for food, and be a naked man, And wander up and down at liberty. He always doted on the youth, and now His love grew desperate; and defying death, He made that cunning entrance I described, And the young man escaped. Teresa. 'Tis a sweet tale: Such as would lull a listening child to sleep, His rosy face besoiled with unwiped tears. And what became of him? Selma. He went on shipboard With those bold voyagers who made discovery Of golden lands. Sesina's younger brother Went likewise, and when he returned to Spain, He told Sesina, that the poor mad youth, Soon after they arrived in that new world, In spite of his dissuasion, seized a boat, And all alone set sail by silent moonlight Up a great river, great as any sea, And ne'er was heard of more: but 'tis supposed, He lived and died among the savage men. ZAPOLYA A CHRISTMAS TALE IN TWO PARTS ??? ???? ??? ??????? ?????? ???????? ?? ???. Apud Athenaeum. ADVERTISEMENT The form of the following dramatic poem is in humble imitation of the Winter's Tale of Shakspeare, except that I have called the first part a Prelude instead of a first Act, as a somewhat nearer resemblance to the plan of the ancients, of which one specimen is left us in the Æschylean Trilogy of the Agamemnon, the Orestes, and the Eumenides. Though a matter of form merely, yet two plays, on different periods of the same tale, might seem less bold, than an interval of twenty years between a first and second act. This is, however, in mere obedience to custom. The effect does not, in reality, at all depend on the Time of the interval; but on a very different principle. There are cases in which an interval of twenty hours between the acts would have a worse effect (i. e. render the imagination less disposed to take the position required) than twenty years in other cases. For the rest, I shall be well content if my readers will take it up, read and judge it, as a Christmas tale. Part I THE PRELUDE, ENTITLED ‘THE USURPER'S FORTUNE’ CHARACTERS Emerick, Usurping King of Illyria. Raab Kiuprili, an Illyrian Chieftain. Casimir, Son of Kiuprili. Chef Ragozzi, a Military Commander. Zapolya, Queen of Illyria. Scene I Front of the Palace with a magnificent Colonnade. On one side a military Guard-house. Sentries pacing backward and forward before the Palace. Chef Ragozzi, at the door of the Guard-house, as looking forwards at some object in the distance. Chef Ragozzi. My eyes deceive me not, it must be he, Who but our chief, my more than father, who But Raab Kiuprili moves with such a gait? Lo! e'en this eager and unwonted haste But agitates, not quells, its majesty. My patron! my commander! yes, 'tis he! Call out the guards. The Lord Kiuprili comes. [Drums beat, &amp;c., the Guard turns out. Enter Raab Kiuprili. Raab Kiuprili (making a signal to stop the drums, &amp;c.). Silence! enough! This is no time, young friend, For ceremonious dues. The summoning drum, Th' air-shattering trumpet, and the horseman's clatter, Are insults to a dying sovereign's ear. Soldiers, 'tis well! Retire! your General greets you, His loyal fellow-warriors. [Guards retire. Chef Ragozzi. Pardon my surprise. Thus sudden from the camp, and unattended! What may these wonders prophesy? Raab Kiuprili. Tell me first, How fares the king? His majesty still lives? Chef Ragozzi. We know no otherwise; but Emerick's friends (And none but they approach him) scoff at hope. Raab Kiuprili. Ragozzi! I have reared thee from a child, And as a child I have reared thee. Whence this air Of mystery? That face was wont to open Clear as the morning to me, shewing all things. Hide nothing from me. Chef Ragozzi. O most loved, most honoured, The mystery that struggles in my looks Betrayed my whole tale to thee, if it told thee That I am ignorant; but fear the worst. And mystery is contagious. All things here Are full of motion: and yet all is silent: And bad men's hopes infect the good with fears. Raab Kiuprili. I have trembling proof within how true thou speakest. Chef Ragozzi. That the prince Emerick feasts the soldiery, Gives splendid arms, pays the commanders' debts, And (it is whispered) by sworn promises Makes himself debtor—hearing this, thou hast heard All— But what my lord will learn too soon himself. Raab Kiuprili. Ha!—Well then, let it come! Worse scarce can come. This letter written by the trembling hand Of royal Andreas calls me from the camp To his immediate presence. It appoints me, The Queen, and Emerick, guardians of the realm, And of the royal infant. Day by day, Robbed of Zapolya's soothing cares, the king Yearns only to behold one precious boon, And with his life breathe forth a father's blessing. Chef Ragozzi. Remember you, my lord! that Hebrew leech Whose face so much distempered you? Raab Kiuprili. Barzoni? I held him for a spy; but the proof failing (More courteously, I own, than pleased myself), I sent him from the camp. Chef Ragozzi. To him, in chief, Prince Emerick trusts his royal brother's health. Raab Kiuprili. Hide nothing, I conjure you! What of him? Chef Ragozzi. With pomp of words beyond a soldier's cunning, And shrugs and wrinkled brow, he smiles and whispers! Talks in dark words of women's fancies; hints That 'twere a useless and a cruel zeal To rob a dying man of any hope, However vain, that soothes him: and, in fine, Denies all chance of offspring from the Queen. Raab Kiuprili. The venomous snake! My heel was on its head, And (fool!) I did not crush it! Chef Ragozzi. Nay, he fears Zapolya will not long survive her husband. Raab Kiuprili. Manifest treason! Even this brief delay Half makes me an accomplice—(If he live,) [Is moving toward the palace. If he but live and know me, all may— Chef Ragozzi. Halt! [Stops him. On pain of death, my Lord! am I commanded To stop all ingress to the palace. Raab Kiuprili. Thou! Chef Ragozzi. No place, no name, no rank excepted— Raab Kiuprili. Thou! Chef Ragozzi. This life of mine, O take it, Lord Kiuprili! I give it as a weapon to thy hands, Mine own no longer. Guardian of Illyria, Useless to thee, 'tis worthless to myself. Thou art the framer of my nobler being; Nor does there live one virtue in my soul, One honourable hope, but calls thee father. Yet ere thou dost resolve, know that yon palace Is guarded from within, that each access Is thronged by armed conspirators, watched by ruffians Pampered with gifts, and hot upon the spoil Which that false promiser still trails before them. I ask but this one boon—reserve my life Till I can lose it for the realm and thee! Raab Kiuprili. My heart is rent asunder. O my country, O fallen Illyria, stand I here spell-bound? Did my King love me? Did I earn his love? Have we embraced as brothers would embrace? Was I his arm, his thunder-bolt? And now Must I, hag-ridden, pant as in a dream? Or, like an eagle, whose strong wings press up Against a coiling serpent's folds, can I Strike but for mockery, and with restless beak Gore my own breast?—Ragozzi, thou art faithful? Chef Ragozzi. Here before Heaven I dedicate my faith To the royal line of Andreas. Raab Kiuprili. Hark, Ragozzi! Guilt is a timorous thing ere perpetration: Despair alone makes wicked men be bold. Come thou with me! They have heard my voice in flight, Have faced round, terror-struck, and feared no longer The whistling javelins of their fell pursuers. Ha! what is this? [Black flag displayed from the Tower of the Palace: a deathbell tolls, &amp;c. Vengeance of Heaven! He is dead. Chef Ragozzi. At length then 'tis announced. Alas! I fear, That these black death-flags are but treason's signals. Raab Kiuprili. A prophecy too soon fulfilled! See yonder! O rank and ravenous wolves! the death-bell echoes Still in the doleful air—and see! they come. Chef Ragozzi. Precise and faithful in their villainy Even to the moment, that the master traitor Had pre-ordained them. Raab Kiuprili. Was it over-haste, Or is it scorn, that in this race of treason Their guilt thus drops its mask, and blazons forth Their infamous plot even to an idiot's sense? Chef Ragozzi. Doubtless they deem Heaven too usurp'd! Heaven's justice Bought like themselves! Being equal all in crime, Do you press on, ye spotted parricides! For the one sole pre-eminence yet doubtful, The prize of foremost impudence in guilt? Raab Kiuprili. The bad man's cunning still prepares the way For its own outwitting. I applaud, Ragozzi! Ragozzi! I applaud, In thee, the virtuous hope that dares look onward And keeps the life-spark warm of future action Beneath the cloak of patient sufferance. Act and appear, as time and prudence prompt thee: I shall not misconceive the part thou playest. Mine is an easier part—to brave the usurper. [Enter a procession of Emerick's Adherents, Nobles, Chieftains, and Soldiers, with Music. They advance toward the front of the stage. Kiuprili makes the signal for them to stop.—The Music ceases. Leader of the Procession. The Lord Kiuprili!—Welcome from the camp. Raab Kiuprili. Grave magistrates and chieftains of Illyria, In good time come ye hither, if ye come As loyal men with honourable purpose To mourn what can alone be mourned; but chiefly To enforce the last commands of royal Andreas And shield the Queen, Zapolya: haply making The mother's joy light up the widow's tears. Leader. Our purpose demands speed. Grace our procession; A warrior best will greet a warlike king. Raab Kiuprili. This patent written by your lawful king, (Lo! his own seal and signature attesting) Appoints as guardians of his realm and offspring, The Queen, and the Prince Emerick, and myself. [Voices of Live King Emerick! an Emerick! an Emerick! What means this clamour? Are these madmen's voices? Or is some knot of riotous slanderers leagued To infamize the name of the king's brother With a lie black as Hell? unmanly cruelty, Ingratitude, and most unnatural treason? [Murmurs. What mean these murmurs? Dare then any here Proclaim Prince Emerick a spotted traitor? One that has taken from you your sworn faith, And given you in return a Judas' bribe, Infamy now, oppression in reversion, And Heaven's inevitable curse hereafter? [Loud murmurs, followed by cries—Emerick! No Baby Prince! No Changelings! Yet bear with me awhile! Have I for this Bled for your safety, conquered for your honour? Was it for this, Illyrians! that I forded Your thaw-swoln torrents, when the shouldering ice Fought with the foe, and stained its jagged points With gore from wounds I felt not? Did the blast Beat on this body, frost-and-famine-numbed, Till my hard flesh distinguished not itself From the insensate mail, its fellow warrior? And have I brought home with me Victory, And with her, hand in hand, firm-footed Peace, Her countenance twice lighted up with glory, As if I had charmed a goddess down from Heaven? But these will flee abhorrent from the throne Of usurpation! [Murmurs increase—and cries of Onward! Onward! Have you then thrown off shame, And shall not a dear friend, a loyal subject, Throw off all fear? I tell ye, the fair trophies Valiantly wrested from a valiant foe, Love's natural offerings to a rightful king, Will hang as ill on this usurping traitor, This brother-blight, this Emerick, as robes Of gold plucked from the images of gods Upon a sacrilegious robber's back. [Enter Lord Casimir. Casimir. Who is this factious insolent, that dares brand The elected King, our chosen Emerick? My father! Raab Kiuprili. Casimir! He, he a traitor! Too soon indeed, Ragozzi! have I learnt it. [Aside. Casimir. My father and my lord! Raab Kiuprili. I know thee not! Leader. Yet the remembrancing did sound right filial. Raab Kiuprili. A holy name and words of natural duty Are blasted by a thankless traitor's utterance. Casimir. O hear me, Sire! not lightly have I sworn Homage to Emerick. Illyria's sceptre Demands a manly hand, a warrior's grasp. The queen Zapolya's self-expected offspring At least is doubtful: and of all our nobles, The king, inheriting his brother's heart, Hath honoured us the most. Your rank, my lord! Already eminent, is—all it can be— Confirmed: and me the king's grace hath appointed Chief of his council and the lord high steward. Raab Kiuprili. (Bought by a bribe!) I know thee now still less. Casimir. So much of Raab Kiuprili's blood flows here, That no power, save that holy name of father, Could shield the man who so dishonoured me. Raab Kiuprili. The son of Raab Kiuprili a bought bondslave, Guilt's pander, treason's mouth-piece, a gay parrot, School'd to shrill forth his feeder's usurp'd titles. And scream, Long live King Emerick! Leaders. Aye, King Emerick! Stand back, my lord! Lead us, or let us pass. Soldier. Nay, let the general speak! Soldiers. Hear him! hear him! Raab Kiuprili. Hear me, Assembled lords and warriors of Illyria, Hear, and avenge me! Twice ten years have I Stood in your presence, honoured by the king: Beloved and trusted. Is there one among you Accuses Raab Kiuprili of a bribe? Or one false whisper in his sovereign's ear? Who here dares charge me with an orphan's rights Outfaced, or widow's plea left undefended? And shall I now be branded by a traitor, A bought, bribed wretch, who, being called my son, Doth libel a chaste matron's name, and plant Hensbane and aconite on a mother's grave? The underling accomplice of a robber, That from a widow and a widow's offspring Would steal their heritage? To God a rebel, And to the common father of his country A recreant ingrate! Casimir. Sire! your words grow dangerous. High-flown romantic fancies ill-beseem Your age and wisdom. 'Tis a statesman's virtue, To guard his country's safety by what means It best may be protected—come what will Of these monk's morals! Raab Kiuprili (aside). Ha! the elder Brutus Made his soul iron, though his sons repented. They boasted not their baseness. [Draws his sword. Infamous changeling! Recant this instant, and swear loyalty, And strict obedience to thy sovereign's will; Or, by the spirit of departed Andreas, Thou diest— [Chiefs, &amp;c., rush to interpose; during the tumult enter Emerick, alarmed. Emerick. Call out the guard! Ragozzi! seize the assassin.— Kiuprili? Ha!— [Making signs to the guard to retire. Pass on, friends! to the palace. [Music recommences.—The Procession passes into the Palace. Emerick. What? Raab Kiuprili? What? a father's sword Against his own son's breast? Raab Kiuprili. 'Twould best excuse him, Were he thy son, Prince Emerick. I abjure him. Emerick. This is my thanks, then, that I have commenced A reign to which the free voice of the nobles Hath called me, and the people, by regards Of love and grace to Raab Kiuprili's house? Raab Kiuprili. What right hadst thou, Prince Emerick, to bestow them? Emerick. By what right dares Kiuprili question me? Raab Kiuprili. By a right common to all loyal subjects— To me a duty! As the realm's co-regent, Appointed by our sovereign's last free act, Writ by himself.— [Grasping the Patent. Emerick. Aye!—Writ in a delirium! Raab Kiuprili. I likewise ask, by whose authority The access to the sovereign was refused me? Emerick. By whose authority dared the general leave His camp and army, like a fugitive? Raab Kiuprili. A fugitive, who, with victory for his comrade, Ran, open-eyed, upon the face of death! A fugitive, with no other fear, than bodements To be belated in a loyal purpose— At the command, Prince! of my king and thine, Hither I came; and now again require Audience of Queen Zapolya; and (the States Forthwith convened) that thou dost shew at large, On what ground of defect thou'st dared annul This thy King's last and solemn act—hast dared Ascend the throne, of which the law had named, And conscience should have made thee, a protector. Emerick. A sovereign's ear ill brooks a subject's questioning! Yet for thy past well-doing—and because 'Tis hard to erase at once the fond belief Long cherished, that Illyria had in thee No dreaming priest's slave, but a Roman lover Of her true weal and freedom—and for this, too, That, hoping to call forth to the broad day-light And fostering breeze of glory all deservings, I still had placed thee foremost. Raab Kiuprili. Prince! I listen. Emerick. Unwillingly I tell thee, that Zapolya, Maddened with grief, her erring hopes proved idle— Casimir. Sire! speak the whole truth! Say, her fraud detected! Emerick. According to the sworn attests in council Of her physician— Raab Kiuprili (aside). Yes! the Jew, Barzoni! Emerick. Under the imminent risk of death she lies, Or irrecoverable loss of reason, If known friend's face or voice renew the frenzy. Casimir (to Kiuprili). Trust me, my lord! a woman's trick has duped you— Us too—but most of all, the sainted Andreas. Even for his own fair fame, his grace prays hourly For her recovery, that (the States convened) She may take counsel of her friends. Emerick. Right, Casimir! Receive my pledge, lord general. It shall stand In her own will to appear and voice her claims; Or (which in truth I hold the wiser course) With all the past passed by, as family quarrels, Let the Queen Dowager, with unblenched honours, Resume her state, our first Illyrian matron. Raab Kiuprili. Prince Emerick! you speak fairly, and your pledge too Is such, as well would suit an honest meaning. Casimir. My lord! you scarce know half his grace's goodness. The wealthy heiress, high-born fair Sarolta, Bred in the convent of our noble ladies, Her relative, the venerable abbess, Hath, at his grace's urgence, wooed and won for me. Emerick. Long may the race, and long may that name flourish, Which your heroic deeds, brave chief, have rendered Dear and illustrious to all true Illyrians. Raab Kiuprili. The longest line that ever tracing herald Or found or feigned, placed by a beggar's soul Hath but a mushroom's date in the comparison: And with the soul, the conscience is coeval, Yea, the soul's essence. Emerick. Conscience, good my lord. Is but the pulse of reason. Is it conscience, That a free nation should be handed down, Like the dull clods beneath our feet, by chance And the blind law of lineage? That whether infant, Or man matured, a wise man or an idiot, Hero or natural coward, shall have guidance Of a free people's destiny, should fall out In the mere lottery of a reckless nature, Where few the prizes and the blanks are countless? Or haply that a nation's fate should hang On the bald accident of a midwife's handling The unclosed sutures of an infant's skull? Casimir. What better claim can sovereign wish or need Than the free voice of men who love their country? Those chiefly who have fought for't? Who by right, Claim for their monarch one, who having obeyed, So hath best learnt to govern; who, having suffered, Can feel for each brave sufferer and reward him? Whence sprang the name of Emperor? Was it not By Nature's fiat? In the storm of triumph, 'Mid warriors' shouts, did her oracular voice Make itself heard: Let the commanding spirit Possess the station of command! Raab Kiuprili. Prince Emerick, Your cause will prosper best in your own pleading. Emerick (aside to Casimir). Ragozzi was thy school-mate—a bold spirit! Bind him to us!—Thy father thaws apace! [Then aloud. Leave us awhile, my lord!—Your friend, Ragozzi, Whom you have not yet seen since his return, Commands the guard to-day. [Casimir retires to the Guard-house; and after a time appears before it with Chef Ragozzi. We are alone. What further pledge or proof desires Kiuprili? Then, with your assent— Raab Kiuprili. Mistake not for assent The unquiet silence of a stern resolve Throttling the impatient voice. I have heard thee, Prince! And I have watched thee, too; but have small faith in A plausible tale told with a flitting eye. [Emerick turns as about to call for the Guard. In the next moment I am in thy power, In this thou art in mine. Stir but a step, Or make one sign—I swear by this good sword, Thou diest that instant. Emerick. Ha, ha!—Well, Sir!—Conclude your homily. Raab Kiuprili. A tale which, whether true or false, comes guarded Against all means of proof, detects itself. The Queen mew'd up—this too from anxious care And love brought forth of a sudden, a twin birth With thy discovery of her plot to rob thee Of a rightful throne!—Mark how the scorpion, falsehood, Coils round in its own perplexity, and fixes Its sting in its own head! Emerick. Aye! to the mark! Raab Kiuprili. Had'st thou believed thine own tale, had'st thou fancied Thyself the rightful successor of Andreas, Would'st thou have pilfered from our school-boys' themes These shallow sophisms of a popular choice? What people? How convened? or, if convened, Must not the magic power that charms together Millions of men in council, needs have power To win or wield them? Better, O far better Shout forth thy titles to yon circling mountains, And with a thousand-fold reverberation Make the rocks flatter thee, and the volleying air, Unbribed, shout back to thee, King Emerick! By wholesome laws to embank the sovereign power, To deepen by restraint, and by prevention Of lawless will to amass and guide the flood In its majestic channel, is man's task And the true patriot's glory! In all else Men safelier trust to Heaven, than to themselves When least themselves in the mad whirl of crowds Where folly is contagious, and too oft Even wise men leave their better sense at home To chide and wonder at them when returned. Emerick (aloud). Is't thus thou scoff'st the people? most of all, The soldiers, the defenders of the people? Raab Kiuprili. O most of all, most miserable nation, For whom the imperial power, enormous bubble! Is blown and kept aloft, or burst and shattered By the bribed breath of a lewd soldiery! Chiefly of such, as from the frontiers far, (Which is the noblest station of true warriors) In rank licentious idleness beleaguer City and Court, a venomed thorn i' the side Of virtuous kings, the tyrant's slave and tyrant, Still ravening for fresh largess! But with such What title claim'st thou, save thy birth? What merits Which many a liegeman may not plead as well, Brave though I grant thee? If a life outlaboured Head, heart, and fortunate arm, in watch and war, For the land's fame and weal; if large acquests. Made honest by the aggression of the foe, And whose best praise is, that they bring us safety; If victory, doubly-wreathed, whose under-garland Of laurel-leaves looks greener and more sparkling Thro' the grey olive-branch; if these, Prince Emerick! Give the true title to the throne, not thou— No! (let Illyria, let the infidel enemy Be judge and arbiter between us!) I, I were the rightful sovereign! Emerick. I have faith That thou both think'st and hop'st it. Fair Zapolya, A provident lady— Raab Kiuprili. Wretch beneath all answer! Emerick. Offers at once the royal bed and throne! Raab Kiuprili. To be a kingdom's bulwark, a king's glory, Yet loved by both, and trusted, and trust-worthy, Is more than to be king; but see! thy rage Fights with thy fear. I will relieve thee! Ho! [To the Guard. Emerick. Not for thy sword, but to entrap thee, ruffian! Thus long I have listened—Guard—ho! from the Palace. [The Guard post from the Guard-house with Chef Ragozzi at their head, and then a number from the Palace— Chef Ragozzi demands Kiuprili's sword, and apprehends him. Casimir. O agony! [To Emerick. Sire, hear me! [To Kiuprili, who turns from him. Hear me, father! Emerick. Take in arrest that traitor and assassin! Who pleads for his life, strikes at mine, his sovereign's. Raab Kiuprili. As the Co-regent of the Realm, I stand Amenable to none save to the States Met in due course of law. But ye are bond-slaves, Yet witness ye that before God and man I here impeach Lord Emerick of foul treason, And on strong grounds attaint him with suspicion Of murder— Emerick. Hence with the madman! Raab Kiuprili. Your Queen's murder, The royal orphan's murder: and to the death Defy him, as a tyrant and usurper. [Hurried off by Ragozzi and the Guard. Emerick. Ere twice the sun hath risen, by my sceptre This insolence shall be avenged. Casimir. O banish him! This infamy will crush me. O for my sake, Banish him, my liege lord! Emerick. What? to the army? Be calm, young friend! Nought shall be done in anger. The child o'erpowers the man. In this emergence I must take counsel for us both. Retire. [Exit Casimir. Emerick (alone, looks at a Calendar). The changeful planet, now in her decay, Dips down at midnight, to be seen no more. With her shall sink the enemies of Emerick, Cursed by the last look of the waning moon: And my bright destiny, with sharpened horns, Shall greet me fearless in the new-born crescent. [Exit. Scene changes to the back of the Palace—a Wooded Park, and Mountains. Enter Zapolya, with an infant in arms. Zapolya. Hush, dear one! hush! My trembling arm disturbs thee! Thou, the protector of the helpless! Thou, The widow's husband and the orphan's father, Direct my steps! Ah whither? O send down Thy angel to a houseless babe and mother, Driven forth into the cruel wilderness! Hush, sweet one! Thou art no Hagar's offspring: thou art The rightful heir of an anointed king! What sounds are those? It is the vesper chaunt Of labouring men returning to their home! Their queen has no home! Hear me, heavenly Father! And let this darkness— Be as the shadow of thy outspread wings To hide and shield us! Start'st thou in thy slumbers? Thou canst not dream of savage Emerick. Hush! Betray not thy poor mother! For if they seize thee I shall grow mad indeed, and they'll believe Thy wicked uncle's lie. Ha! what? A soldier? [Enter Chef Ragozzi. Chef Ragozzi. Sure Heaven befriends us. Well! he hath escaped! O rare tune of a tyrant's promises That can enchant the serpent treachery From forth its lurking hole in the heart. ‘Ragozzi! O brave Ragozzi! Count! Commander! What not?’ And all this too for nothing! a poor nothing! Merely to play the underling in the murder Of my best friend Kiuprili! His own son—monstrous! Tyrant! I owe thee thanks, and in good hour Will I repay thee, for that thou thought'st me too A serviceable villain. Could I now But gain some sure intelligence of the queen: Heaven bless and guard her! Zapolya (coming forward). Art thou not Ragozzi? Chef Ragozzi. The Queen! Now then the miracle is full! I see heaven's wisdom is an over-match For the devil's cunning. This way, madam, haste! Zapolya. Stay! Oh, no! Forgive me if I wrong thee! This is thy sovereign's child: Oh, pity us, And be not treacherous! [Kneeling. Chef Ragozzi (raising her). Madam! For mercy's sake! Zapolya. But tyrants have a hundred eyes and arms! Chef Ragozzi. Take courage, madam! 'Twere too horrible, (I can not do't) to swear I'm not a monster!— Scarce had I barr'd the door on Raab Kiuprili— Zapolya. Kiuprili! How? Chef Ragozzi. There is not time to tell it,— The tyrant called me to him, praised my zeal— (And be assured I overtopt his cunning And seemed right zealous.) But time wastes: In fine, Bids me dispatch my trustiest friends, as couriers With letters to the army. The thought at once Flashed on me. I disguised my prisoner— Zapolya. What, Raab Kiuprili? Chef Ragozzi. Yes! my noble general! I sent him off, with Emerick's own pacquet, Haste, and post haste—Prepared to follow him— Zapolya. Ah, how? Is it joy or fear? My limbs seem sinking!— Chef Ragozzi (supporting her). Heaven still befriends us. I have left my charger, A gentle beast and fleet, and my boy's mule, One that can shoot a precipice like a bird, Just where the wood begins to climb the mountains. The course we'll thread will mock the tyrant's guesses, Or scare the followers. Ere we reach the main road The Lord Kiuprili will have sent a troop To escort me. Oh, thrice happy when he finds The treasure which I convoy! Zapolya. One brief moment, That praying for strength I may have strength. This babe, Heaven's eye is on it, and its innocence Is, as a prophet's prayer, strong and prevailing! Through thee, dear babe, the inspiring thought possessed me, When the loud clamor rose, and all the palace Emptied itself—(They sought my life, Ragozzi!) Like a swift shadow gliding, I made way To the deserted chamber of my lord.— [Then to the infant. And thou didst kiss thy father's lifeless lips, And in thy helpless hand, sweet slumberer! Still clasp'st the signet of thy royalty. As I removed the seal, the heavy arm Dropt from the couch aslant, and the stiff finger Seemed pointing at my feet. Provident Heaven! Lo, I was standing on the secret door, Which, through a long descent where all sound perishes, Led out beyond the palace. Well I knew it— But Andreas framed it not! He was no tyrant! Chef Ragozzi. Haste, madam! let me take this precious burden! [He kneels as he takes the child. Zapolya. Take him! And if we be pursued, I charge thee, Flee thou and leave me! Flee and save thy king! [Then as going off, she looks back on the palace. Thou tyrant's den, be called no more a palace! The orphan's angel at the throne of heaven Stands up against thee, and there hover o'er thee A Queen's, a Mother's, and a Widow's curse. Henceforth a dragon's haunt, fear and suspicion Stand sentry at thy portals! Faith and honour, Driven from the throne, shall leave the attainted nation: And, for the iniquity that houses in thee, False glory, thirst of blood, and lust of rapine, (Fateful conjunction of malignant planets) Shall shoot their blastments on the land. The fathers Henceforth shall have no joy in their young men, And when they cry: Lo! a male child is born! The mother shall make answer with a groan. For bloody usurpation, like a vulture, Shall clog its beak within Illyria's heart. Remorseless slaves of a remorseless tyrant, They shall be mocked with sounds of liberty, And liberty shall be proclaimed alone To thee, O Fire! O Pestilence! O Sword! Till Vengeance hath her fill.—And thou, snatched hence, Poor friendless fugitive! with mother's wailing, Offspring of Royal Andreas, shalt return, With trump and timbrel-clang, and popular shout, In triumph to the palace of thy fathers! [Exeunt. Part II THE SEQUEL, ENTITLED ‘THE USURPER'S FATE’ USURPATION ENDED; OR, SHE COMES AGAIN ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS Old Bathory, a Mountaineer. Bethlen Bathory, the young Prince Andreas, supposed son of Old Bathory. Lord Rudolph, a Courtier, but friend to the Queen's party. Laska, Steward to Casimir, betrothed to Glycine. Pestalutz, an Assassin, in Emerick's employ. Lady Sarolta, Wife of Lord Casimir. Glycine, Orphan Daughter of Chef Ragozzi. Between the flight of the Queen, and the civil war which immediately followed, and in which Emerick remained the victor, a space of twenty years is supposed to have elapsed. ACT I Scene I A Mountainous Country. Bathory's Dwelling at the end of the Stage. Enter Lady Sarolta and Glycine. Glycine. Well then! our round of charity is finished. Rest, Madam! You breathe quick. Sarolta. What, tired, Glycine? No delicate court-dame, but a mountaineer By choice no less than birth, I gladly use The good strength Nature gave me. Glycine. That last cottage Is built as if an eagle or a raven Had chosen it for her nest. Sarolta. So many are The sufferings which no human aid can reach, It needs must be a duty doubly sweet To heal the few we can. Well! let us rest. Glycine. There? [Pointing to Bathory's dwelling. Sarolta. Here! For on this spot Lord Casimir Took his last leave. On yonder mountain-ridge I lost the misty image which so long Lingered, or seemed at least to linger on it. Glycine. And what if even now, on that same ridge, A speck should rise, and still enlarging, lengthening, As it clomb downwards, shape itself at last To a numerous cavalcade, and spurring foremost, Who but Sarolta's own dear lord returned From his high embassy? Sarolta. Thou hast hit my thought! All the long day, from yester-morn to evening, The restless hope fluttered about my heart. Oh we are querulous creatures! Little less Than all things can suffice to make us happy; And little more than nothing is enough To discontent us.—Were he come, then should I Repine he had not arrived just one day earlier To keep his birth-day here, in his own birth-place. Glycine. But our best sports belike, and gay processions Would to my lord have seemed but work-day sights Compared with those the royal court affords. Sarolta. I have small wish to see them. A spring morning With its wild gladsome minstrelsy of birds And its bright jewelry of flowers and dew-drops (Each orbéd drop an orb of glory in it) Would put them all in eclipse. This sweet retirement Lord Casimir's wish alone would have made sacred: But, in good truth, his loving jealousy Did but command, what I had else entreated. Glycine. And yet had I been born Lady Sarolta, Been wedded to the noblest of the realm, So beautiful besides, and yet so stately— Sarolta. Hush! Innocent flatterer! Glycine. Nay! to my poor fancy The royal court would seem an earthly heaven, Made for such stars to shine in, and be gracious. Sarolta. So doth the ignorant distance still delude us! Thy fancied heaven, dear girl, like that above thee, In its mere self a cold, drear, colourless void, Seen from below and in the large, becomes The bright blue ether, and the seat of gods! Well! but this broil that scared you from the dance? And was not Laska there: he, your betrothed? Glycine. Yes, madam! he was there. So was the maypole, For we danced round it. Sarolta. Ah, Glycine! why, Why did you then betroth yourself? Glycine. Because My own dear lady wished it! 'twas you asked me! Sarolta. Yes, at my lord's request, but never wished, My poor affectionate girl, to see thee wretched. Thou knowest not yet the duties of a wife. Glycine. Oh, yes! It is a wife's chief duty, madam! To stand in awe of her husband, and obey him, And, I am sure, I never shall see Laska But I shall tremble. Sarolta. Not with fear, I think, For you still mock him. Bring a seat from the cottage. [Exit Glycine into the cottage, Sarolta continues her speech looking after her. Something above thy rank there hangs about thee, And in thy countenance, thy voice, and motion, Yea, e'en in thy simplicity, Glycine, A fine and feminine grace, that makes me feel More as a mother than a mistress to thee! Thou art a soldier's orphan! that—the courage, Which rising in thine eye, seems oft to give A new soul to its gentleness, doth prove thee! Thou art sprung too of no ignoble blood, Or there's no faith in instinct! [Angry voices and clamour within. Re-enter Glycine. Glycine. Oh, madam! there's a party of your servants, And my lord's steward, Laska, at their head, Have come to search for old Bathory's son, Bethlen, that brave young man! 'twas he, my lady, That took our parts, and beat off the intruders, And in mere spite and malice, now they charge him With bad words of Lord Casimir and the king. Pray don't believe them, madam! This way! This way! Lady Sarolta's here.— [Calling without. Sarolta. Be calm, Glycine. Enter Laska and Servants with Old Bathory. Laska (to Bathory). We have no concern with you! What needs your presence? Old Bathory. What! Do you think I'll suffer my brave boy To be slandered by a set of coward-ruffians, And leave it to their malice,—yes, mere malice!— To tell its own tale? [Laska and Servants bow to Lady Sarolta. Sarolta. Laska! What may this mean? Laska. Madam! and may it please your ladyship! This old man's son, by name Bethlen Bathory, Stands charged, on weighty evidence, that he, On yester-eve, being his lordship's birth-day, Did traitorously defame Lord Casimir: The lord high steward of the realm, moreover— Sarolta. Be brief! We know his titles! Laska. And moreover Raved like a traitor at our liege King Emerick. And furthermore, said witnesses make oath, Led on the assault upon his lordship's servants; Yea, insolently tore, from this, your huntsman, His badge of livery of your noble house, And trampled it in scorn. Sarolta (to the Servants who offer to speak). You have had your spokesman! Where is the young man thus accused? Old Bathory. I know not: But if no ill betide him on the mountains, He will not long be absent! Sarolta. Thou art his father? Old Bathory. None ever with more reason prized a son; Yet I hate falsehood more than I love him. But more than one, now in my lady's presence, Witnessed the affray, besides these men of malice; And if I swerve from truth— Glycine. Yes! good old man! My lady! pray believe him! Sarolta. Hush, Glycine Be silent, I command you. [Then to Bathory. Speak! we hear you! Old Bathory. My tale is brief. During our festive dance, Your servants, the accusers of my son, Offered gross insults, in unmanly sort, To our village maidens. He (could he do less?) Rose in defence of outraged modesty, And so persuasive did his cudgel prove, (Your hectoring sparks so over-brave to women Are always cowards) that they soon took flight, And now in mere revenge, like baffled boasters, Have framed this tale, out of some hasty words Which their own threats provoked. Sarolta. Old man! you talk Too bluntly! Did your son owe no respect To the livery of our house? Old Bathory. Even such respect As the sheep's skin should gain for the hot wolf That hath begun to worry the poor lambs! Laska. Old insolent ruffian! Glycine. Pardon! pardon, madam! I saw the whole affray. The good old man Means no offence, sweet lady!—You, yourself, Laska! know well, that these men were the ruffians! Shame on you! Sarolta. What! Glycine? Go, retire! [Exit Glycine. Be it then that these men faulted. Yet yourself, Or better still belike the maidens' parents, Might have complained to us. Was ever access Denied you? Or free audience? Or are we Weak and unfit to punish our own servants? Old Bathory. So then! So then! Heaven grant an old man patience! And must the gardener leave his seedling plants, Leave his young roses to the rooting swine While he goes ask their master, if perchance His leisure serve to scourge them from their ravage? Laska. Ho! Take the rude clown from your lady's presence! I will report her further will! Sarolta. Wait then, Till thou hast learnt it! Fervent good old man! Forgive me that, to try thee, I put on A face of sternness, alien to my meaning! [Then speaks to the Servants. Hence! leave my presence! and you, Laska! mark me! Those rioters are no longer of my household! If we but shake a dewdrop from a rose In vain would we replace it, and as vainly Restore the tear of wounded modesty To a maiden's eye familiarized to licence.— But these men, Laska— Laska (aside). Yes, now 'tis coming. Sarolta. Brutal aggressors first, then baffled dastards, That they have sought to piece out their revenge With a tale of words lured from the lips of anger Stamps them most dangerous; and till I want Fit means for wicked ends, we shall not need Their services. Discharge them! You, Bathory! Are henceforth of my household! I shall place you Near my own person. When your son returns. Present him to us! Old Bathory. Ha! what strangers here! What business have they in an old man's eye? Your goodness, lady—and it came so sudden— I can not—must not—let you be deceived. I have yet another tale, but— [Then to Sarolta aside. not for all ears! Sarolta. I oft have passed your cottage, and still praised Its beauty, and that trim orchard-plot, whose blossoms The gusts of April showered aslant its thatch. Come, you shall show it me! And, while you bid it Farewell, be not ashamed that I should witness The oil of gladness glittering on the water Of an ebbing grief. [Bathory shows her into his cottage. Laska (alone). Vexation! baffled! school'd! Ho! Laska! wake! why? what can all this mean? She sent away that cockatrice in anger! Oh the false witch! It is too plain, she loves him. And now, the old man near my lady's person. She'll see this Bethlen hourly! [Laska flings himself into the seat. Glycine peeps in. Glycine. Laska! Laska! my lady gone? Laska. Gone. Glycine. Have you yet seen him? Is he returned? [Laska starts up. Has the seat stung you, Laska? Laska. No, serpent! no; 'tis you that sting me; you! What! you would cling to him again? Glycine. Whom? Laska. Bethlen! Bethlen! Yes; gaze as if your very eyes embraced him! Ha! you forget the scene of yesterday! Mute ere he came, but then—Out on your screams, And your pretended fears! Glycine. Your fears, at least, Were real, Laska! or your trembling limbs And white cheeks played the hypocrites most vilely! Laska. I fear! whom? what? Glycine. I know what I should fear, Were I in Laska's place. Laska. What? Glycine. My own conscience, For having fed my jealousy and envy With a plot, made out of other men's revenges, Against a brave and innocent young man's life! Yet, yet, pray tell me! Laska. You will know too soon. Glycine. Would I could find my lady! though she chid me— Yet this suspense— [Going. Laska. Stop! stop! one question only— I am quite calm— Glycine. Ay, as the old song says, Calm as a tiger, valiant as a dove. Nay now, I have marred the verse: well! this one question— Laska. Are you not bound to me by your own promise? And is it not as plain— Glycine. Halt! that's two questions. Laska. Pshaw! Is it not as plain as impudence, That you're in love with this young swaggering beggar, Bethlen Bathory? When he was accused, Why pressed you forward? Why did you defend him? Glycine. Question meet question: that's a woman's privilege, Why, Laska, did you urge Lord Casimir To make my lady force that promise from me? Laska. So then, you say, Lady Sarolta forced you? Glycine. Could I look up to her dear countenance, And say her nay? As far back as I wot of All her commands were gracious, sweet requests. How could it be then, but that her requests Must needs have sounded to me as commands? And as for love, had I a score of loves, I'd keep them all for my dear, kind, good mistress. Laska. Not one for Bethlen? Glycine. Oh! that's a different thing. To be sure he's brave, and handsome, and so pious To his good old father. But for loving him— Nay, there, indeed you are mistaken, Laska! Poor youth! I rather think I grieve for him; For I sigh so deeply when I think of him! And if I see him, the tears come in my eyes, And my heart beats; and all because I dreamt That the war-wolf had gored him as he hunted In the haunted forest! Laska. You dare own all this? Your lady will not warrant promise-breach. Mine, pampered Miss! you shall be; and I'll make you Grieve for him with a vengeance. Odd's, my fingers Tingle already! [Makes threatening sings. Glycine (aside). Ha! Bethlen coming this way! [Glycine then cries out. Oh, save me! save me! Pray don't kill me, Laska! Enter Bethlen in a Hunting Dress. Bethlen. What, beat a woman! Laska (to Glycine). O you cockatrice! Bethlen. Unmanly dastard, hold! Laska. Do you chance to know Who—I—am, Sir?—('Sdeath! how black he looks!) Bethlen. I have started many strange beasts in my time, But none less like a man, than this before me That lifts his hand against a timid female. Laska. Bold youth! she's mine. Glycine. No, not my master yet, But only is to be; and all, because Two years ago my lady asked me, and I promised her, not him; and if she'll let me, I'll hate you, my lord's steward. Bethlen. Hush, Glycine! Glycine. Yes, I do, Bethlen; for he just now brought False witnesses to swear away your life: Your life, and old Bathory's too. Bethlen. Bathory's! Where is my father? Answer, or—Ha! gone! [Laska during this time retires from the Stage. Glycine. Oh, heed not him! I saw you pressing onward, And did but feign alarm. Dear gallant youth, It is your life they seek! Bethlen. My life? Glycine. Alas, Lady Sarolta even— Bethlen. She does not know me! Glycine. Oh that she did! she could not then have spoken With such stern countenance. But though she spurn me, I will kneel, Bethlen— Bethlen. Not for me, Glycine! What have I done? or whom have I offended? Glycine. Rash words, 'tis said, and treasonous of the king. [Bethlen mutters to himself. Glycine (aside). So looks the statue, in our hall, o' the god, The shaft just flown that killed the serpent! Bethlen. King! Glycine. Ah, often have I wished you were a king. You would protect the helpless every where, As you did us. And I, too, should not then Grieve for you, Bethlen, as I do; nor have The tears come in my eyes; nor dream bad dreams That you were killed in the forest; and then Laska Would have no right to rail at me, nor say (Yes, the base man, he says,) that I—I love you. Bethlen. Pretty Glycine! wert thou not betrothed— But in good truth I know not what I speak. This luckless morning I have been so haunted With my own fancies, starting up like omens, That I feel like one, who waking from a dream Both asks and answers wildly.—But Bathory? Glycine. Hist! 'tis my lady's step! She must not see you! [Bethlen retires. Enter from the Cottage Sarolta and Bathory. Sarolta. Go, seek your son! I need not add, be speedy— You here, Glycine? [Exit Bathory. Glycine. Pardon, pardon, Madam! If you but saw the old man's son, you would not, You could not have him harmed. Sarolta. Be calm, Glycine! Glycine. No, I shall break my heart. Sarolta. Ha! is it so? O strange and hidden power of sympathy, That of like fates, though all unknown to each, Dost make blind instincts, orphan's heart to orphan's Drawing by dim disquiet! Glycine. Old Bathory— Sarolta. Seeks his brave son. Come, wipe away thy tears. Yes, in good truth, Glycine, this same Bethlen Seems a most noble and deserving youth. Glycine. My lady does not mock me? Sarolta. Where is Laska? Has he not told thee? Glycine. Nothing. In his fear— Anger, I mean—stole off—I am so fluttered— Left me abruptly— Sarolta. His shame excuses him! He is somewhat hardly tasked; and in discharging His own tools, cons a lesson for himself. Bathory and the youth henceforward live Safe in my lord's protection. Glycine. The saints bless you! Shame on my graceless heart! How dared I fear, Lady Sarolta could be cruel? Sarolta. Come, Be yourself, girl! Glycine. O, 'tis so full here! And now it can not harm him if I tell you, That the old man's son— Sarolta. Is not that old man's son! A destiny, not unlike thine own, is his. For all I know of thee is, that thou art A soldier's orphan: left when rage intestine Shook and engulphed the pillars of Illyria. This other fragment, thrown back by that same earthquake, This, so mysteriously inscribed by nature, Perchance may piece out and interpret thine. Command thyself! Be secret! His true father— Hear'st thou? Glycine. O tell— Bethlen (rushing out). Yes, tell me, Shape from heaven! Who is my father? Sarolta (gazing with surprise). Thine? Thy father? Rise! Glycine. Alas! He hath alarmed you, my dear lady! Sarolta. His countenance, not his act! Glycine. Rise, Bethlen! Rise! Bethlen. No; kneel thou too! and with thy orphan's tongue Plead for me! I am rooted to the earth And have no power to rise! Give me a father! There is a prayer in those uplifted eyes That seeks high Heaven! But I will overtake it, And bring it back, and make it plead for me In thine own heart! Speak! Speak! Restore to me A name in the world! Sarolta. By that blest Heaven I gazed at, I know not who thou art. And if I knew, Dared I—But rise! Bethlen. Blest spirits of my parents, Ye hover o'er me now! Ye shine upon me! And like a flower that coils forth from a ruin, I feel and seek the light I can not see! Sarolta. Thou see'st yon dim spot on the mountain's ridge, But what it is thou know'st not. Even such Is all I know of thee—haply, brave youth, Is all Fate makes it safe for thee to know! Bethlen. Safe? Safe? O let me then inherit danger, And it shall be my birth-right! Sarolta (aside). That look again!— The wood which first incloses, and then skirts The highest track that leads across the mountains— Thou know'st it, Bethlen? Bethlen. Lady, 'twas my wont To roam there in my childhood oft alone And mutter to myself the name of father. For still Bathory (why, till now I guessed not) Would never hear it from my lips, but sighing Gazed upward. Yet of late an idle terror— Glycine. Madam, that wood is haunted by the war-wolves, Vampires, and monstrous— Sarolta. Moon-calves, credulous girl! Haply some o'ergrown savage of the forest Hath his lair there, and fear hath framed the rest. After that last great battle, (O young man! Thou wakest anew my life's sole anguish) that Which fixed Lord Emerick on his throne, Bathory Led by a cry, far inward from the track, In the hollow of an oak, as in a nest, Did find thee, Bethlen, then a helpless babe. The robe that wrapt thee was a widow's mantle. Bethlen. An infant's weakness doth relax my frame. O say—I fear to ask— Sarolta. And I to tell thee. Bethlen. Strike! O strike quickly! See, I do not shrink. I am stone, cold stone. Sarolta. Hid in a brake hard by, Scarce by both palms supported from the earth, A wounded lady lay, whose life fast waning Seemed to survive itself in her fixt eyes, That strained towards the babe. At length one arm Painfully from her own weight disengaging, She pointed first to heaven, then from her bosom Drew forth a golden casket. Thus entreated Thy foster-father took thee in his arms, And kneeling spake: ‘If aught of this world's comfort Can reach thy heart, receive a poor man's troth, That at my life's risk I will save thy child!’ Her countenance worked, as one that seemed preparing A loud voice, but it died upon her lips In a faint whisper, ‘Fly! Save him! Hide—hide all!’ Bethlen. And did he leave her? What! had I a mother? And left her bleeding, dying? Bought I vile life With the desertion of a dying mother? Oh agony! Glycine. Alas! thou art bewildered, And dost forget thou wert a helpless infant! Bethlen. What else can I remember, but a mother Mangled and left to perish? Sarolta. Hush, Glycine! It is the ground-swell of a teeming instinct: Let it but lift itself to air and sunshine, And it will find a mirror in the waters It now makes boil above it. Check him not! Bethlen. O that I were diffused among the waters That pierce into the secret depths of earth, And find their way in darkness! Would that I Could spread myself upon the homeless winds! And I would seek her! for she is not dead! She can not die! O pardon, gracious lady! You were about to say, that he returned— Sarolta. Deep Love, the godlike in us, still believes Its objects as immortal as itself! Bethlen. And found her still— Sarolta. Alas! he did return, He left no spot unsearched in all the forest, But she (I trust me by some friendly hand) Had been borne off. Bethlen. O whither? Glycine. Dearest Bethlen! I would that you could weep like me! O do not Gaze so upon the air! Sarolta. While he was absent, A friendly troop, 'tis certain, scoured the wood, Hotly pursued indeed by Emerick. Bethlen. Emerick. Oh hell! Glycine. Bethlen! Bethlen. Hist! I'll curse him in a whisper! This gracious lady must hear blessings only. She hath not yet the glory round her head, Nor those strong eagle wings, which make swift way To that appointed place, which I must seek; Or else she were my mother! Sarolta. Noble youth! From me fear nothing! Long time have I owed Offerings of expiation for misdeeds Long past that weigh me down, though innocent! Thy foster-father hid the secret from thee, For he perceived thy thoughts as they expanded, Proud, restless, and ill-sorting with thy state! Vain was his care! Thou'st made thyself suspected E'en where suspicion reigns, and asks no proof But its own fears! Great Nature hath endowed thee With her best gifts! From me thou shalt receive All honourable aidance! But haste hence! Travel will ripen thee, and enterprise Beseems thy years! Be thou henceforth my soldier! And whatsoe'er betide thee, still believe That in each noble deed, achieved or suffered, Thou solvest best the riddle of thy birth! And may the light that streams from thine own honour Guide thee to that thou seekest! Glycine. Must he leave us? Bethlen. And for such goodness can I return nothing But some hot tears that sting mine eyes? Some sighs That if not breathed would swell my heart to stifling? May heaven and thine own virtues, high-born lady, Be as a shield of fire, far, far aloof To scare all evil from thee! Yet, if fate Hath destined thee one doubtful hour of danger, From the uttermost region of the earth, methinks, Swift as a spirit invoked, I should be with thee! And then, perchance, I might have power to unbosom These thanks that struggle here. Eyes fair as thine Have gazed on me with tears of love and anguish, Which these eyes saw not, or beheld unconscious; And tones of anxious fondness, passionate prayers, Have been talked to me! But this tongue ne'er soothed A mother's ear, lisping a mother's name! O, at how dear a price have I been loved And no love could return! One boon then, lady! Where'er thou bidd'st, I go thy faithful soldier, But first must trace the spot, where she lay bleeding Who gave me life. No more shall beast of ravine Affront with baser spoil that sacred forest! Or if avengers more than human haunt there, Take they what shape they list, savage or heavenly, They shall make answer to me, though my heart's blood Should be the spell to bind them. Blood calls for blood! [Exit Bethlen. Sarolta. Ah! it was this I feared. To ward off this Did I withhold from him that old Bathory Returning hid beneath the self-same oak, Where the babe lay, the mantle, and some jewel Bound on his infant arm. Glycine. Oh, let me fly And stop him! Mangled limbs do there lie scattered Till the lured eagle bears them to her nest. And voices have been heard! And there the plant grows That being eaten gives the inhuman wizard Power to put on the fell hyæna's shape. Sarolta. What idle tongue hath bewitched thee, Glycine? I hoped that thou had'st learnt a nobler faith. Glycine. O chide me not, dear lady; question Laska, Or the old man. Sarolta. Forgive me, I spake harshly. It is indeed a mighty sorcery That doth enthral thy young heart, my poor girl, And what hath Laska told thee? Glycine. Three days past A courier from the king did cross that wood; A wilful man, that armed himself on purpose: And never hath been heard of from that time! [Sound of horns without. Sarolta. Hark! dost thou hear it! Glycine. 'Tis the sound of horns! Our huntsmen are not out! Sarolta. Lord Casimir Would not come thus! [Horns again. Glycine. Still louder! Sarolta. Haste we hence! For I believe in part thy tale of terror! But, trust me, 'tis the inner man transformed: Beasts in the shape of men are worse than war-wolves. [Sarolta and Glycine exeunt. Trumpets, &amp;c. louder. Enter Emerick, Lord Rudolph, Laska, and Huntsmen and Attendants. Rudolph. A gallant chase, sire. Emerick. Aye, but this new quarry That we last started seems worth all the rest. [then to Laska. And you—excuse me—what's your name? Laska. Whatever Your majesty may please. Emerick. Nay, that's too late, man. Say, what thy mother and thy godfather Were pleased to call thee. Laska. Laska, my liege sovereign. Emerick. Well, my liege subject, Laska! And you are Lord Casimir's steward? Laska. And your majesty's creature. Emerick. Two gentle dames made off at our approach. Which was your lady? Laska My liege lord, the taller. The other, please your grace, is her poor handmaid, Long since betrothed to me. But the maid's froward— Yet would your grace but speak— Emerick. Hum, master steward! I am honoured with this sudden confidence. Lead on. [to Laska, then to Rudolph. Lord Rudolph, you'll announce our coming. Greet fair Sarolta from me, and entreat her To be our gentle hostess. Mark, you add How much we grieve, that business of the state Hath forced us to delay her lord's return. Lord Rudolph (aside). Lewd, ingrate tyrant! Yes, I will announce thee. Emerick. Now onward all. [Exeunt attendants. A fair one, by my faith! If her face rival but her gait and stature, My good friend Casimir had his reasons too. ‘Her tender health, her vow of strict retirement, Made early in the convent—His word pledged—’ All fictions, all! fictions of jealousy. Well! If the mountain move not to the prophet, The prophet must to the mountain! In this Laska There's somewhat of the knave mixed up with dolt. Through the transparence of the fool, methought. I saw (as I could lay my finger on it) The crocodile's eye, that peered up from the bottom. This knave may do us service. Hot ambition Won me the husband. Now let vanity And the resentment for a forced seclusion Decoy the wife! Let him be deemed the aggressor Whose cunning and distrust began the game! [Exit. ACT II Scene I A savage wood. At one side a cavern, overhung with ivy. Zapolya and Raab Kiuprili discovered: both, but especially the latter, in rude and savage garments. Raab Kiuprili. Heard you then aught while I was slumbering? Zapolya. Nothing. Only your face became convulsed. We miserable! Is heaven's last mercy fled? Is sleep grown treacherous? Raab Kiuprili. O for a sleep, for sleep itself to rest in! I dream'd I had met with food beneath a tree, And I was seeking you, when all at once My feet became entangled in a net: Still more entangled as in rage I tore it. At length I freed myself, had sight of you, But as I hastened eagerly, again I found my frame encumbered: a huge serpent Twined round my chest, but tightest round my throat. Zapolya. Alas! 'twas lack of food: for hunger chokes! Raab Kiuprili. And now I saw you by a shrivelled child Strangely pursued. You did not fly, yet neither Touched you the ground, methought, but close above it Did seem to shoot yourself along the air, And as you passed me, turned your face and shrieked. Zapolya. I did in truth send forth a feeble shriek, Scarce knowing why. Perhaps the mock'd sense craved To hear the scream, which you but seemed to utter. For your whole face looked like a mask of torture! Yet a child's image doth indeed pursue me Shrivelled with toil and penury! Raab Kiuprili. Nay! what ails you? Zapolya. A wondrous faintness there comes stealing o'er me. Is it Death's lengthening shadow, who comes onward, Life's setting sun behind him? Raab Kiuprili. Cheerly! The dusk Will quickly shroud us. Ere the moon be up, Trust me I'll bring thee food! Zapolya. Hunger's tooth has Gnawn itself blunt. O, I could queen it well O'er my own sorrows as my rightful subjects. But wherefore, O revered Kiuprili! wherefore Did my importunate prayers, my hopes and fancies, Force thee from thy secure though sad retreat? Would that my tongue had then cloven to my mouth! But Heaven is just! With tears I conquered thee, And not a tear is left me to repent with! Had'st thou not done already—had'st thou not Suffered—oh, more than e'er man feigned of friendship? Raab Kiuprili. Yet be thou comforted! What! had'st thou faith When I turned back incredulous? 'Twas thy light That kindled mine. And shall it now go out, And leave thy soul in darkness? Yet look up, And think thou see'st thy sainted lord commissioned And on his way to aid us! Whence those late dreams, Which after such long interval of hopeless And silent resignation all at once Night after night commanded thy return Hither? and still presented in clear vision This wood as in a scene? this very cavern? Thou darest not doubt that Heaven's especial hand Worked in those signs. The hour of thy deliverance Is on the stroke:—for misery can not add Grief to thy griefs, or patience to thy sufferance! Zapolya. Can not! Oh, what if thou wert taken from me? Nay, thou said'st well: for that and death were one. Life's grief is at its height indeed; the hard Necessity of this inhuman state Hath made our deeds inhuman as our vestments. Housed in this wild wood, with wild usages, Danger our guest, and famine at our portal— Wolf-like to prowl in the shepherd's fold by night! At once for food and safety to affrighten The traveller from his road— [Glycine is heard singing without. Raab Kiuprili. Hark! heard you not A distant chaunt? SONG By Glycine A sunny shaft did I behold, From sky to earth it slanted: And poised therein a bird so bold— Sweet bird, thou wert enchanted! He sank, he rose, he twinkled, he trolled Within that shaft of sunny mist; His eyes of fire, his beak of gold, All else of amethyst! And thus he sang: ‘Adieu! adieu! Love's dreams prove seldom true. The blossoms, they make no delay: The sparkling dew-drops will not stay. Sweet month of May, We must away; Far, far away! To-day! to-day!’ Zapolya. Sure 'tis some blest spirit! For since thou slew'st the usurper's emissary That plunged upon us, a more than mortal fear Is as a wall, that wards off the beleaguerer And starves the poor besieged. [Song again. Raab Kiuprili. It is a maiden's voice! quick to the cave! Zapolya. Hark! her voice falters! [Exit Zapolya. Raab Kiuprili. She must not enter The cavern, else I will remain unseen! [Kiuprili retires to one side of the stage. Glycine enters singing. Glycine. A savage place! saints shield me! Bethlen! Bethlen! Not here?—There's no one here! I'll sing again! [Sings again. If I do not hear my own voice, I shall fancy Voices in all chance sounds! [Starts. 'Twas some dry branch Dropt of itself! Oh, he went forth so rashly, Took no food with him—only his arms and boar-spear! What if I leave these cakes, this cruse of wine, Here by this cave, and seek him with the rest? Raab Kiuprili (unseen). Leave them and flee! Glycine (shrieks, then recovering). Where are you? Raab Kiuprili (still unseen). Leave them! Glycine. 'Tis Glycine! Speak to me, Bethlen! speak in your own voice! All silent!—If this were the war-wolf's den! 'Twas not his voice!— [Glycine leaves the provisions, and exit. Kiuprili comes forward, seizes them and carries them into the cavern. Glycine returns. Glycine. Shame! Nothing hurt me! If some fierce beast have gored him, he must needs Speak with a strange voice. Wounds cause thirst and hoarseness! Speak, Bethlen! or but moan. St—St—No—Bethlen! If I turn back and he should be found dead here, [She creeps nearer and nearer to the cavern. I should go mad!—Again!—'Twas my own heart! Hush, coward heart! better beat loud with fear, Than break with shame and anguish! [As she approaches to enter the cavern, Kiuprili stops her. Glycine shrieks. Saints protect me! Raab Kiuprili. Swear then by all thy hopes, by all thy fears— Glycine. Save me! Raab Kiuprili. Swear secrecy and silence! Glycine. I swear! Raab Kiuprili. Tell what thou art, and what thou seekest? Glycine. Only A harmless orphan youth, to bring him food— Raab Kiuprili. Wherefore in this wood? Glycine. Alas! it was his purpose— Raab Kiuprili. With what intention came he? Would'st thou save him, Hide nothing! Glycine. Save him! O forgive his rashness! He is good, and did not know that thou wert human! Raab Kiuprili. Human? With what design? Glycine. To kill thee, or If that thou wert a spirit, to compel thee By prayers, and with the shedding of his blood, To make disclosure of his parentage. But most of all— Zapolya (rushing out from the cavern). Heaven's blessing on thee! Speak! Glycine. Whether his mother live, or perished here! Zapolya. Angel of mercy, I was perishing And thou did'st bring me food: and now thou bring'st The sweet, sweet food of hope and consolation To a mother's famished heart! His name, sweet maiden! Glycine. E'en till this morning we were wont to name him Bethlen Bathory! Zapolya. Even till this morning? This morning? when my weak faith failed me wholly! Pardon, O thou that portion'st out our sufferance, And fill'st again the widow's empty cruse! Say on! Glycine. The false ones charged the valiant youth With treasonous words of Emerick— Zapolya. Ha! my son! Glycine. And of Lord Casimir— Raab Kiuprili (aside). O agony! my son! Glycine. But my dear lady— Zapolya and Raab Kiuprili. Who? Glycine. Lady Sarolta Frowned and discharged these bad men. Raab Kiuprili (to himself). Righteous Heaven Sent me a daughter once, and I repined That it was not a son. A son was given me. My daughter died, and I scarce shed a tear: And lo! that son became my curse and infamy. Zapolya (embraces Glycine). Sweet innocent! and you came here to seek him, And bring him food. Alas! thou fear'st? Glycine. Not much! My own dear lady, when I was a child, Embraced me oft, but her heart never beat so. For I too am an orphan, motherless! Raab Kiuprili (to Zapolya). O yet beware, lest hope's brief flash but deepen The after gloom, and make the darkness stormy! In that last conflict, following our escape, The usurper's cruelty had clogged our flight With many a babe and many a childing mother. This maid herself is one of numberless Planks from the same vast wreck. [Then to Glycine again. Well! Casimir's wife— Glycine. She is always gracious, and so praised the old man That his heart o'erflowed, and made discovery That in this wood— Zapolya. O speak! Glycine. A wounded lady— [Zapolya faints—they both support her. Glycine. Is this his mother? Raab Kiuprili. She would fain believe it, Weak though the proofs be. Hope draws towards itself The flame with which it kindles. [Horn heard without. To the cavern! Quick! quick! Glycine. Perchance some huntsmen of the king's. Raab Kiuprili. Emerick? Glycine. He came this morning— [They retire to the cavern, bearing Zapolya. Then enter Bethlen, armed with a boar-spear. Bethlen. I had a glimpse Of some fierce shape; and but that Fancy often Is Nature's intermeddler, and cries halves With the outward sight, I should believe I saw it Bear off some human prey. O my preserver! Bathory! Father! Yes, thou deserv'st that name! Thou did'st not mock me! These are blessed findings! The secret cypher of my destiny [Looking at his signet. Stands here inscribed: it is the seal of fate! Ha!—Had ever monster fitting lair, 'tis yonder! Thou yawning den, I well remember thee! Mine eyes deceived me not. Heaven leads me on! Now for a blast, loud as a king's defiance, To rouse the monster couchant o'er his ravine! [Blows the horn—then a pause. Another blast! and with another swell To you, ye charméd watchers of this wood! If haply I have come, the rightful heir Of vengeance: if in me survive the spirits Of those, whose guiltless blood flowed streaming here! [Blows again louder. Still silent? Is the monster gorged? Heaven shield me! Thou, faithful spear! be both my torch and guide. [As Bethlen is about to enter, Kiuprili speaks from the cavern unseen. Raab Kiuprili. Withdraw thy foot! Retract thine idle spear, And wait obedient! Bethlen. Ha! What art thou? speak! Raab Kiuprili (still unseen). Avengers! Bethlen. By a dying mother's pangs E'en such am I. Receive me! Raab Kiuprili (still unseen). Wait! Beware! At thy first step, thou treadest upon the light, Thenceforth must darkling flow, and sink in darkness! Bethlen. Ha! see my boar-spear trembles like a reed!— Oh, fool! mine eyes are duped by my own shuddering.— Those piléd thoughts, built up in solitude, Year following year, that pressed upon my heart As on the altar of some unknown God, Then, as if touched by fire from heaven descending, Blazed up within me at a father's name— Do they desert me now?—at my last trial? Voice of command! and thou, O hidden Light! I have obeyed! Declare ye by what name I dare invoke you! Tell what sacrifice Will make you gracious. Raab Kiuprili (still unseen). Patience! Truth! Obedience! Be thy whole soul transparent! so the Light, Thou seekest, may enshrine itself within thee! Thy name? Bethlen. Ask rather the poor roaming savage, Whose infancy no holy rite had blest, To him, perchance, rude spoil or ghastly trophy, In chase or battle won, have given a name. I have none—but like a dog have answered To the chance sound which he that fed me, called me. Raab Kiuprili (still unseen). Thy birth-place? Bethlen. Deluding spirits! Do ye mock me? Question the Night! Bid Darkness tell its birth-place? Yet hear! Within yon old oak's hollow trunk, Where the bats cling, have I surveyed my cradle! The mother-falcon hath her nest above it, And in it the wolf litters!—I invoke you, Tell me, ye secret ones! if ye beheld me As I stood there, like one who having delved For hidden gold hath found a talisman. O tell! what rights, what offices of duty This signet doth command? What rebel spirits Owe homage to its Lord? Raab Kiuprili (still unseen). More, guiltier, mightier, Than thou mayest summon! Wait the destined hour! Bethlen. O yet again, and with more clamorous prayer, I importune ye! Mock me no more with shadows! This sable mantle—tell, dread voice! did this Enwrap one fatherless! Zapolya (unseen). One fatherless! Bethlen. A sweeter voice!—A voice of love and pity! Was it the softened echo of mine own? Sad echo! but the hope it kill'd was sickly, And ere it died it had been mourned as dead! One other hope yet lives within my soul: Quick let me ask!—while yet this stifling fear, This stop of the heart, leaves utterance!—Are—are these The sole remains of her that gave me life? Have I a mother? [Zapolya rushes out to embrace him. Ha! Zapolya. My son! my son! A wretched—Oh no, no! a blest—a happy mother! [They embrace. Kiuprili and Glycine come forward and the curtain drops. ACT III Scene I A stately room in Lord Casimir's castle. Enter Emerick and Laska. Emerick. I do perceive thou hast a tender conscience, Laska, in all things that concern thine own Interest or safety. Laska. In this sovereign presence I can fear nothing, but your dread displeasure. Emerick. Perchance, thou think'st it strange, that I of all men Should covet thus the love of fair Sarolta, Dishonouring Casimir? Laska. Far be it from me! Your Majesty's love and choice bring honour with them. Emerick. Perchance, thou hast heard that Casimir is my friend, Fought for me, yea, for my sake, set at nought A parent's blessing; braved a father's curse? Laska (aside). Would I but knew now, what his Majesty meant! Oh yes, Sire! 'tis our common talk, how Lord Kiuprili, my Lord's father— Emerick. 'Tis your talk, Is it, good statesman Laska? Laska. No, not mine, Not mine, an please your Majesty! There are Some insolent malcontents indeed that talk thus— Nay worse, mere treason. As Bathory's son, The fool that ran into the monster's jaws. Emerick. Well, 'tis a loyal monster if he rids us Of traitors! But art sure the youth's devoured? Laska. Not a limb left, an please your Majesty! And that unhappy girl— Emerick. Thou followed'st her Into the wood? [Laska bows assent. Henceforth then I'll believe That jealousy can make a hare a lion. Laska. Scarce had I got the first glimpse of her veil, When, with a horrid roar that made the leaves Of the wood shake— Emerick. Made thee shake like a leaf! Laska. The war-wolf leapt; at the first plunge he seized her; Forward I rushed! Emerick. Most marvellous! Laska. Hurled my javelin; Which from his dragon-scales recoiling— Emerick. Enough! And take, friend, this advice. When next thou tonguest it, Hold constant to thy exploit with this monster, And leave untouched your common talk aforesaid, What your Lord did, or should have done. Laska. My talk? The saints forbid! I always said, for my part, ‘Was not the king Lord Casimir's dearest friend? Was not that friend a king? Whate'er he did 'Twas all from pure love to his Majesty.’ Emerick. And this then was thy talk? While knave and coward, Both strong within thee, wrestle for the uppermost, In slips the fool and takes the place of both. Babbler! Lord Casimir did, as thou and all men. He loved himself, loved honours, wealth, dominion. All these were set upon a father's head: Good truth! a most unlucky accident! For he but wished to hit the prize; not graze The head that bore it: so with steady eye Off flew the parricidal arrow.—Even As Casimir loved Emerick, Emerick Loves Casimir, intends him no dishonour. He winked not then, for love of me forsooth! For love of me now let him wink! Or if The dame prove half as wise as she is fair, He may still pass his hand, and find all smooth. [Passing his hand across his brow. Laska. Your Majesty's reasoning has convinced me. Emerick. Thee! 'Tis well! and more than meant. For by my faith I had half forgotten thee.—Thou hast the key? [Laska bows. And in your lady's chamber there's full space? Laska. Between the wall and arras to conceal you. Emerick. Here! This purse is but an earnest of thy fortune, If thou prov'st faithful. But if thou betrayest me, Hark you!—the wolf that shall drag thee to his den Shall be no fiction. [Exit Emerick. Laska manet with a key in one hand, and a purse in the other. Laska. Well then! here I stand, Like Hercules, on either side a goddess. Call this (looking at the purse) Preferment; this (holding up the key) Fidelity! And first my golden goddess: what bids she? Only:—‘This way, your Majesty! hush! The household Are all safe lodged.’—Then, put Fidelity Within her proper wards, just turn her round— So—the door opens—and for all the rest, 'Tis the king's deed, not Laska's. Do but this And—‘I'm the mere earnest of your future fortunes.’ But what says the other?—Whisper on! I hear you! [Putting the key to his ear. All very true!—but, good Fidelity! If I refuse King Emerick, will you promise, And swear now, to unlock the dungeon door, And save me from the hangman? Aye! you're silent! What, not a word in answer? A clear nonsuit! Now for one look to see that all are lodged At the due distance—then—yonder lies the road For Laska and his royal friend, King Emerick! [Exit Laska. Then enter Bathory and Bethlen. Bethlen. He looked as if he were some God disguised In an old warrior's venerable shape To guard and guide my mother. Is there not Chapel or oratory in this mansion? Old Bathory. Even so. Bethlen. From that place then am I to take A helm and breast-plate, both inlaid with gold, And the good sword that once was Raab Kiuprili's. Old Bathory. Those very arms this day Sarolta show'd me— With wistful look. I'm lost in wild conjectures! Bethlen. O tempt me not, e'en with a wandering guess, To break the first command a mother's will Imposed, a mother's voice made known to me! ‘Ask not, my son,’ said she, ‘our names or thine. The shadow of the eclipse is passing off The full orb of thy destiny! Already The victor Crescent glitters forth and sheds O'er the yet lingering haze a phantom light. Thou canst not hasten it! Leave then to Heaven The work of Heaven: and with a silent spirit Sympathize with the powers that work in silence!’ Thus spake she, and she looked as she were then Fresh from some heavenly vision! [Re-enter Laska, not perceiving them. Laska. All asleep! [Then observing Bethlen, stands in idiot-affright. I must speak to it first—Put—put the question! I'll confess all! [Stammering with fear. Old Bathory. Laska! what ails thee, man? Laska (pointing to Bethlen.) There! Old Bathory. I see nothing! where? Laska. He does not see it! Bethlen, torment me not! Bethlen. Soft! Rouse him gently! He hath outwatched his hour, and half asleep, With eyes half open, mingles sight with dreams. Old Bathory. Ho! Laska! Don't you know us! 'tis Bathory And Bethlen! Laska. Good now! Ha! ha! An excellent trick. Afraid? Nay, no offence! But I must laugh. But are you sure now, that 'tis you, yourself? Bethlen. Would'st be convinced? Laska. No nearer, pray! consider! If it should prove his ghost, the touch would freeze me To a tombstone. No nearer! Bethlen. The fool is drunk! Laska. Well now! I love a brave man to my heart. I myself braved the monster, and would fain Have saved the false one from the fate she tempted. Old Bathory. You, Laska? Bethlen (to Bathory). Mark! Heaven grant it may be so! Glycine? Laska. She! I traced her by the voice. You'll scarce believe me, when I say I heard The close of a song: the poor wretch had been singing: As if she wished to compliment the war-wolf At once with music and a meal! Bethlen (to Bathory). Mark that! Laska. At the next moment I beheld her running, Wringing her hands with, ‘Bethlen! O poor Bethlen!’ I almost fear, the sudden noise I made, Rushing impetuous through the brake, alarmed her. She stopt, then mad with fear, turned round and ran Into the monster's gripe. One piteous scream I heard. There was no second—I— Bethlen. Stop there! We'll spare your modesty! Who dares not honour Laska's brave tongue, and high heroic fancy? Laska. You too, Sir Knight, have come back safe and sound! You played the hero at a cautious distance! Or was it that you sent the poor girl forward To stay the monster's stomach? Dainties quickly Pall on the taste and cloy the appetite! Old Bathory. Laska, beware! Forget not what thou art! Should'st thou but dream thou'rt valiant, cross thyself! And ache all over at the dangerous fancy! Laska. What then! you swell upon my lady's favour, High Lords and perilous of one day's growth! But other judges now sit on the bench! And haply, Laska hath found audience there, Where to defend the treason of a son Might end in lifting up both son and father Still higher; to a height from which indeed You both may drop, but, spite of fate and fortune, Will be secured from falling to the ground. 'Tis possible too, young man! that royal Emerick, At Laska's rightful suit, may make inquiry By whom seduced, the maid so strangely missing— Bethlen. Soft! my good Laska! might it not suffice, If to yourself, being Lord Casimir's steward, I should make record of Glycine's fate? Laska. 'Tis well! it shall content me! though your fear Has all the credit of these lowered tones. First we demand the manner of her death? Bethlen. Nay! that's superfluous! Have you not just told us, That you yourself, led by impetuous valour, Witnessed the whole? My tale's of later date. After the fate, from which your valour strove In vain to rescue the rash maid, I saw her! Laska. Glycine? Bethlen. Nay! Dare I accuse wise Laska, Whose words find access to a monarch's ear, Of a base, braggart lie? It must have been Her spirit that appeared to me. But haply I come too late? It has itself delivered Its own commission to you? Old Bathory. 'Tis most likely! And the ghost doubtless vanished, when we entered And found brave Laska staring wide—at nothing! Laska. 'Tis well! You've ready wits! I shall report them, With all due honour, to his Majesty! Treasure them up, I pray! A certain person, Whom the king flatters with his confidence, Tells you, his royal friend asks startling questions! 'Tis but a hint! And now what says the ghost! Bethlen. Listen! for thus it spake: ‘Say thou to Laska, Glycine, knowing all thy thoughts engrossed In thy new office of king's fool and knave, Foreseeing thou'lt forget with thine own hand To make due penance for the wrongs thou'st caused her, For thy soul's safety, doth consent to take it From Bethlen's cudgel’—thus. [Beats him off. Off! scoundrel! off! [Laska runs away. Old Bathory. The sudden swelling of this shallow dastard Tells of a recent storm: the first disruption Of the black cloud that hangs and threatens o'er us. Bethlen. E'en this reproves my loitering. Say where lies The oratory? Old Bathory. Ascend yon flight of stairs! Midway the corridor a silver lamp Hangs o'er the entrance of Sarolta's chamber, And facing it, the low arched oratory! Me thou'lt find watching at the outward gate: For a petard might burst the bars, unheard By the drenched porter, and Sarolta hourly Expects Lord Casimir, spite of Emerick's message! Bethlen. There I will meet you! And till then good-night! Dear good old man, good-night! Old Bathory. O yet one moment! What I repelled, when it did seem my own, I cling to, now 'tis parting—call me father! It can not now mislead thee. O my son, Ere yet our tongues have learnt another name, Bethlen!—say ‘Father’ to me! Bethlen. Now, and for ever My father! other sire than thou, on earth I never had, a dearer could not have! From the base earth you raised me to your arms, And I would leap from off a throne, and kneeling, Ask Heaven's blessing from thy lips. My father! Bathory. Go! Go! [Exit Bethlen. May every star now shining over us, Be as an angel's eye, to watch and guard him! [Exit Bathory. Scene changes to a splendid Bed-chamber, hung with tapestry. Sarolta and an Attendant. Attendant. We all did love her, madam! Sarolta. She deserved it! Luckless Glycine! rash, unhappy girl! 'Twas the first time she e'er deceived me. Attendant. She was in love, and had she not died thus, With grief for Bethlen's loss, and fear of Laska, She would have pined herself to death at home. Sarolta. Has the youth's father come back from his search? Attendant. He never will, I fear me. O dear lady! That Laska did so triumph o'er the old man— It was quite cruel—‘You'll be sure,’ said he, ‘To meet with part at least of your son Bethlen, Or the war-wolf must have a quick digestion! Go! Search the wood by all means! Go! I pray you!’ Sarolta. Inhuman wretch! Attendant. And old Bathory answered With a sad smile, ‘It is a witch's prayer, And may Heaven read it backwards.’ Though she was rash, 'Twas a small fault for such a punishment! Sarolta. Nay! 'twas my grief, and not my anger spoke. Small fault indeed! but leave me, my poor girl! I feel a weight that only prayer can lighten. [Exit Attendant. O they were innocent, and yet have perished In their May of life; and Vice grows old in triumph. Is it Mercy's hand, that for the bad man holds Life's closing gate?— Still passing thence petitionary Hours To woo the obdurate spirit to repentance? Or would this chillness tell me, that there is Guilt too enormous to be duly punished, Save by increase of guilt? The Powers of Evil Are jealous claimants. Guilt too hath its ordeal, And Hell its own probation!—Merciful Heaven, Rather than this, pour down upon thy suppliant Disease, and agony, and comfortless want! O send us forth to wander on, unsheltered! Make our food bitter with despiséd tears! Let viperous scorn hiss at us as we pass! Yea, let us sink down at our enemy's gate, And beg forgiveness and a morsel of bread! With all the heaviest worldly visitations Let the dire father's curse that hovers o'er us Work out its dread fulfilment, and the spirit Of wronged Kiuprili be appeased. But only, Only, O merciful in vengeance! let not That plague turn inward on my Casimir's soul! Scare thence the fiend Ambition, and restore him To his own heart! O save him! Save my husband! [During the latter part of this speech Emerick comes forward from his hiding-place. Sarolta seeing him, without recognizing him. In such a shape a father's curse should come. Emerick (advancing). Fear not. Sarolta. Who art thou? Robber? Traitor? Emerick. Friend! Who in good hour hath startled these dark fancies, Rapacious traitors, that would fain depose Joy, love, and beauty, from their natural thrones: Those lips, those angel eyes, that regal forehead. Sarolta. Strengthen me, Heaven! I must not seem afraid! [Aside. The king to-night then deigns to play the masker. What seeks your Majesty? Emerick. Sarolta's love; And Emerick's power lies prostrate at her feet. Sarolta. Heaven guard the sovereign's power from such debasement! Far rather, Sire, let it descend in vengeance On the base villain, on the faithless slave Who dared unbar the doors of these retirements! For whom? Has Casimir deserved this insult? O my misgiving heart! If—if—from Heaven Yet not from you, Lord Emerick! Emerick. Chiefly from me. Has he not like an ingrate robbed my court Of Beauty's star, and kept my heart in darkness? First then on him I will administer justice— If not in mercy, yet in love and rapture. [Seizes her Sarolta. Help! Treason! Help! Emerick. Call louder! Scream again! Here's none can hear you! Sarolta. Hear me, hear me, Heaven! Emerick. Nay, why this rage? Who best deserves you? Casimir, Emerick's bought implement, the jealous slave That mews you up with bolts and bars? or Emerick Who proffers you a throne? Nay, mine you shall be. Hence with this fond resistance! Yield; then live This month a widow, and the next a queen! Sarolta. Yet, yet for one brief moment [Struggling. Unhand me, I conjure you. [She throws him off, and rushes towards a toilet. Emerick follows, and as she takes a dagger, he grasps it in her hand. Emerick. Ha! Ha! a dagger; A seemly ornament for a lady's casket! 'Tis held, devotion is akin to love, But yours is tragic! Love in war! It charms me, And makes your beauty worth a king's embraces! [During this speech Bethlen enters armed. Bethlen. Ruffian, forbear! Turn, turn and front my sword! Emerick. Pish! who is this? Sarolta. O sleepless eye of Heaven! A blest, a blessed spirit! Whence camest thou? May I still call thee Bethlen? Bethlen. Ever, lady, Your faithful soldier! Emerick. Insolent slave! Depart Know'st thou not me? Bethlen. I know thou art a villain And coward! That thy devilish purpose marks thee! What else, this lady must instruct my sword! Sarolta. Monster, retire! O touch him not, thou blest one! This is the hour that fiends and damnéd spirits Do walk the earth, and take what form they list! Yon devil hath assumed a king's! Bethlen. Usurped it! Emerick. The king will play the devil with thee indeed! But that I mean to hear thee howl on the rack, I would debase this sword, and lay thee prostrate At this thy paramour's feet; then drag her forth Stained with adulterous blood, and— —mark you, traitress! Strumpeted first, then turned adrift to beggary! Thou prayed'st for't too. Sarolta. Thou art so fiendish wicked, That in thy blasphemies I scarce hear thy threats! Bethlen. Lady, be calm! fear not this king of the buskin! A king? Oh laughter! A king Bajazet! That from some vagrant actor's tiring-room, Hath stolen at once his speech and crown! Emerick. Ah! treason! Thou hast been lessoned and tricked up for this! As surely as the wax on thy death-warrant Shall take the impression of this royal signet, So plain thy face hath ta'en the mask of rebel! [Bethlen seizes Emerick's hand and eagerly observes the signet. Bethlen. It must be so! 'Tis e'en the counterpart! But with a foul usurping cypher on it! The light hath flashed from Heaven, and I must follow it! O curst usurper! O thou brother-murderer! That mad'st a star-bright queen a fugitive widow! Who fill'st the land with curses, being thyself All curses in one tyrant! see and tremble! This is Kiuprili's sword that now hangs o'er thee! Kiuprili's blasting curse, that from its point Shoots lightnings at thee. Hark! in Andreas' name, Heir of his vengeance, hell-hound! I defy thee. [They fight, and just as Emerick is disarmed, in rush Casimir, Old Bathory, and Attendants. Casimir runs in between the combatants, and parts them; in the struggle Bethlen's sword is thrown down. Casimir. The king! disarmed too by a stranger! Speak! What may this mean? Emerick. Deceived, dishonored lord! Ask thou yon fair adultress! She will tell thee A tale, which would'st thou be both dupe and traitor, Thou wilt believe against thy friend and sovereign! Thou art present now, and a friend's duty ceases: To thine own justice leave I thine own wrongs. Of half thy vengeance I perforce must rob thee, For that the sovereign claims. To thy allegiance I now commit this traitor and assassin. [Then to the Attendants. Hence with him to the dungeon! and to-morrow, Ere the sun rises,—Hark! your heads or his! Bethlen. Can Hell work miracles to mock Heaven's justice? Emerick. Who speaks to him dies! The traitor that has menaced His king, must not pollute the breathing air, Even with a word! Casimir (to Bathory). Hence with him to the dungeon! [Exit Bethlen, hurried off by Bathory and Attendants. Emerick. We hunt to-morrow in your upland forest: Thou (to Casimir) wilt attend us: and wilt then explain This sudden and most fortunate arrival. [Exit Emerick; Manent Casimir and Sarolta. Sarolta. My lord! my husband! look whose sword lies yonder! It is Kiuprili's, Casimir; 'tis thy father's! And wielded by a stripling's arm, it baffled, Yea, fell like Heaven's own lightnings on that Tarquin. Casimir. Hush! hush! I had detected ere I left the city The tyrant's curst intent. Lewd, damnéd ingrate! For him did I bring down a father's curse! Swift, swift must be our means! To-morrow's sun Sets on his fate or mine! O blest Sarolta! No other prayer, late penitent, dare I offer, But that thy spotless virtues may prevail O'er Casimir's crimes, and dread Kiuprili's curse! [Exeunt. ACT IV Scene I A glade in a wood. Enter Casimir looking anxiously around. Casimir. This needs must be the spot! O, here he comes! Enter Lord Rudolph. Well met, Lord Rudolph!— Your whisper was not lost upon my ear, And I dare trust— Lord Rudolph. Enough! the time is precious! You left Temeswar late on yester-eve? And sojourned there some hours? Casimir. I did so! Lord Rudolph. Heard you Aught of a hunt preparing? Casimir. Yes; and met The assembled huntsmen! Lord Rudolph. Was there no word given? Casimir. The word for me was this:—The royal Leopard Chases thy milk-white dedicated Hind. Lord Rudolph. Your answer? Casimir. As the word proves false or true Will Casimir cross the hunt, or join the huntsmen! Lord Rudolph. The event redeemed their pledge? Casimir. It did, and therefore Have I sent back both pledge and invitation. The spotless Hind hath fled to them for shelter, And bears with her my seal of fellowship! [They take hands. Lord Rudolph. But Emerick! how when you reported to him Sarolta's disappearance, and the flight Of Bethlen with his guards? Casimir. O he received it As evidence of their mutual guilt. In fine, With cozening warmth condoled with, and dismissed me. Lord Rudolph. I entered as the door was closing on you: His eye was fixed, yet seemed to follow you,— With such a look of hate, and scorn and triumph, As if he had you in the toils already, And were then choosing where to stab you first. But hush! draw back! Casimir. This nook is at the furthest From any beaten track. Lord Rudolph. There! mark them! [Points to where Laska and Pestalutz cross the Stage. Casimir. Laska! Lord Rudolph. One of the two I recognized this morning; His name is Pestalutz: a trusty ruffian, Whose face is prologue still to some dark murder. Beware no stratagem, no trick of message, Dispart you from your servants. Casimir (aside). I deserve it. The comrade of that ruffian is my servant: The one I trusted most and most preferred. But we must part. What makes the king so late? It was his wont to be an early stirrer. Lord Rudolph. And his main policy. To enthral the sluggard nature in ourselves Is, in good truth, the better half of the secret To enthral the world: for the will governs all. See, the sky lowers! the cross-winds waywardly Chase the fantastic masses of the clouds With a wild mockery of the coming hunt! Casimir. Mark yonder mass! I make it wear the shape Of a huge ram that butts with head depressed. Lord Rudolph (smiling). Belike, some stray sheep of the oozy flock, Which, if bards lie not, the Sea-shepherds tend, Glaucus or Proteus. But my fancy shapes it A monster couchant on a rocky shelf. Casimir. Mark too the edges of the lurid mass— Restless, as if some idly-vexing Sprite, On swift wing coasting by, with tetchy hand Pluck'd at the ringlets of the vaporous Fleece. These are sure signs of conflict nigh at hand, And elemental war! [A single trumpet heard at some distance. Lord Rudolph. That single blast Announces that the tyrant's pawing courser Neighs at the gate. [Trumpets. Hark! now the king comes forth! For ever 'midst this crash of horns and clarions He mounts his steed, which proudly rears an-end While he looks round at ease, and scans the crowd, Vain of his stately form and horsemanship! I must away! my absence may be noticed. Casimir. Oft as thou canst, essay to lead the hunt Hard by the forest-skirts; and ere high noon Expect our sworn confederates from Temeswar. I trust, ere yet this clouded sun slopes westward. That Emerick's death, or Casimir's, will appease The manes of Zapolya and Kiuprili! [Exit Rudolph. The traitor, Laska!— And yet Sarolta, simple, inexperienced, Could see him as he was, and often warned me. Whence learned she this?—O she was innocent! And to be innocent is Nature's wisdom! The fledge-dove knows the prowlers of the air, Feared soon as seen, and flutters back to shelter. And the young steed recoils upon his haunches, The never-yet-seen adder's hiss first heard. O surer than Suspicion's hundred eyes Is that fine sense, which to the pure in heart, By mere oppugnancy of their own goodness, Reveals the approach of evil. Casimir! O fool! O parricide! through yon wood did'st thou, With fire and sword, pursue a patriot father, A widow and an orphan. Dar'st thou then (Curse-laden wretch) put forth these hands to raise The ark, all sacred, of thy country's cause? Look down in pity on thy son, Kiuprili! And let this deep abhorrence of his crime, Unstained with selfish fears, be his atonement! O strengthen him to nobler compensation In the deliverance of his bleeding country! [Exit Casimir. Scene changes to the mouth of a Cavern, as in Act II. Zapolya and Glycine discovered. Zapolya. Our friend is gone to seek some safer cave: Do not then leave me long alone, Glycine! Having enjoyed thy commune, loneliness, That but oppressed me hitherto, now scares. Glycine. I shall know Bethlen at the furthest distance, And the same moment I descry him, lady, I will return to you. [Exit Glycine. [Enter Old Bathory, speaking as he enters. Old Bathory. Who hears? A friend! A messenger from him who bears the signet! Zapolya. He hath the watch-word!—Art thou not Bathory? Old Bathory. O noble lady! greetings from your son! [Bathory kneels. Zapolya. Rise! rise! Or shall I rather kneel beside thee, And call down blessings from the wealth of Heaven Upon thy honoured head? When thou last saw'st me I would full fain have knelt to thee, and could not, Thou dear old man! How oft since then in dreams Have I done worship to thee, as an angel Bearing my helpless babe upon thy wings! Old Bathory. O he was born to honour! Gallant deeds And perilous hath he wrought since yester-eve. Now from Temeswar (for to him was trusted A life, save thine, the dearest) he hastes hither— Zapolya. Lady Sarolta mean'st thou? Old Bathory. She is safe. The royal brute hath overleapt his prey, And when he turned, a sworded Virtue faced him. My own brave boy—O pardon, noble lady! Your son— Zapolya. Hark! Is it he? Old Bathory. I hear a voice Too hoarse for Bethlen's! 'Twas his scheme and hope, Long ere the hunters could approach the forest, To have led you hence.—Retire. Zapolya. O life of terrors! Old Bathory. In the cave's mouth we have such 'vantage ground That even this old arm— [Exeunt Zapolya and Bathory into the cave. Enter Laska and Pestalutz. Laska. Not a step further! Pestalutz. Dastard! was this your promise to the king? Laska. I have fulfilled his orders. Have walked with you As with a friend: have pointed out Lord Casimir: And now I leave you to take care of him. For the king's purposes are doubtless friendly. Pestalutz. Be on your guard, man! Laska. Ha! what now? Pestalutz. Behind you! 'Twas one of Satan's imps, that grinned and threatened you For your most impudent hope to cheat his master! Laska. Pshaw! What! you think 'tis fear that makes me leave you? Pestalutz. Is't not enough to play the knave to others, But thou must lie to thine own heart? Laska. Friend! Laska will be found at his own post, Watching elsewhere for the king's interest. There's a rank plot that Laska must hunt down, 'Twixt Bethlen and Glycine! Pestalutz. What! the girl Whom Laska saw the war-wolf tear in pieces? Laska. Well! Take my arms! Hark! should your javelin fail you, These points are tipt with venom. [Seeing Glycine without. By Heaven! Glycine! Now as you love the king, help me to seize her! [They run out after Glycine. Enter Bathory from the cavern. Old Bathory. Rest, lady, rest! I feel in every sinew A young man's strength returning! Which way went they? The shriek came thence. [Enter Glycine. Glycine. Ha! weapons here? Then, Bethlen, thy Glycine Will die with thee or save thee! [She seizes them and rushes out. Bathory following. Music, and Peasants with hunting spears cross the stage, singing chorally. CHORAL SONG Up, up! ye dames, ye lasses gay! To the meadows trip away. 'Tis you must tend the flocks this morn, And scare the small birds from the corn. Not a soul at home may stay: For the shepherds must go With lance and bow To hunt the wolf in the woods to-day. Leave the hearth and leave the house To the cricket and the mouse: Find grannam out a sunny seat, With babe and lambkin at her feet. Not a soul at home may stay: For the shepherds must go With lance and bow To hunt the wolf in the woods to-day. [Exeunt Huntsmen. Re-enter Bathory, Bethlen, and Glycine. Glycine. And now once more a woman— Bethlen. Was it then That timid eye, was it those maiden hands That sped the shaft, which saved me and avenged me? Old Bathory. 'Twas as a vision blazoned on a cloud By lightning, shaped into a passionate scheme Of life and death! I saw the traitor, Laska, Stoop and snatch up the javelin of his comrade; The point was at your back, when her shaft reached him. The coward turned, and at the self-same instant The braver villain fell beneath your sword. Enter Zapolya. Zapolya. Bethlen! my child! and safe too! Bethlen. Mother! Queen. Royal Zapolya! name me Andreas! Nor blame thy son, if being a king, he yet Hath made his own arm minister of his justice. So do the gods who launch the thunderbolt! Zapolya. O Raab Kiuprili! Friend! Protector! Guide! In vain we trenched the altar round with waters, A flash from Heaven hath touched the hidden incense— Bethlen. And that majestic form that stood beside thee Was Raab Kiuprili! Zapolya. It was Raab Kiuprili; As sure as thou art Andreas, and the king. Old Bathory. Hail Andreas! hail my king! Andreas. Stop, thou revered one, Lest we offend the jealous destinies By shouts ere victory. Deem it then thy duty To pay this homage, when 'tis mine to claim it. Glycine. Accept thine hand-maid's service! [Kneeling. Zapolya. Raise her, son! O raise her to thine arms! she saved thy life, And through her love for thee, she saved thy mother's! Hereafter thou shalt know, that this dear maid Hath other and hereditary claims Upon thy heart, and with Heaven-guarded instinct But carried on the work her sire began! Andreas. Dear maid! more dear thou canst not be! the rest Shall make my love religion. Haste we hence: For as I reached the skirts of this high forest, I heard the noise and uproar of the chase, Doubling its echoes from the mountain foot. Glycine. Hark! sure the hunt approaches. [Horn without, and afterwards distant thunder. Zapolya. O Kiuprili! Old Bathory. The demon-hunters of the middle air Are in full cry, and scare with arrowy fire The guilty! Hark! now here, now there, a horn Swells singly with irregular blast! the tempest Has scattered them! [Horns at a distance. Zapolya. O Heavens! where stays Kiuprili? Old Bathory. The wood will be surrounded! leave me here. Andreas. My mother! let me see thee once in safety. I too will hasten back, with lightning's speed, To seek the hero! Old Bathory. Haste! my life upon it I'll guide him safe. Andreas (thunder). Ha! what a crash was there! Heaven seems to claim a mightier criminal Than yon vile subaltern. Zapolya. Your behest, High powers, Lo, I obey! To the appointed spirit, That hath so long kept watch round this drear cavern, In fervent faith, Kiuprili, I entrust thee! [Exeunt Zapolya, Andreas, and Glycine. Old Bathory. Yon bleeding corse may work us mischief still: Once seen, 'twill rouse alarm and crowd the hunt From all parts towards this spot. Stript of its armour, I'll drag it hither. [Exit Bathory. Several Hunters cross the Stage. Enter Kiuprili. Raab Kiuprili (throwing off his disguise). Since Heaven alone can save me, Heaven alone Shall be my trust. Haste! haste! Zapolya, flee! Gone! Seized perhaps? Oh no, let me not perish Despairing of Heaven's justice! Faint, disarmed, Each sinew powerless; senseless rock, sustain me! Thou art parcel of my native land! A sword! Ha! and my sword! Zapolya hath escaped, The murderers are baffled, and there lives An Andreas to avenge Kiuprili's fall!— There was a time, when this dear sword did flash As dreadful as the storm-fire from mine arm— I can scarce raise it now—yet come, fell tyrant! And bring with thee my shame and bitter anguish, To end his work and thine! Kiuprili now Can take the death-blow as a soldier should. Re-enter Bathory, with the dead body of Pestalutz. Old Bathory. Poor tool and victim of another's guilt! Thou follow'st heavily: a reluctant weight! Good truth, it is an undeservéd honour That in Zapolya and Kiuprili's cave A wretch like thee should find a burial-place. 'Tis he!—In Andreas' and Zapolya's name Follow me, reverend form! Thou need'st not speak, For thou canst be no other than Kiuprili. Kiuprili. And are they safe? [Noise without. Old Bathory. Conceal yourself, my lord! I will mislead them! Kiuprili. Is Zapolya safe? Old Bathory. I doubt it not; but haste, haste, I conjure you! [Enter Casimir. Casimir. Monster! Thou shalt not now escape me! Old Bathory. Stop, lord Casimir! It is no monster. Casimir. Art thou too a traitor? Is this the place where Emerick's murderers lurk? Say where is he that, tricked in this disguise, First lured me on, then scared my dastard followers? Thou must have seen him. Say where is th' assassin? Old Bathory. There lies the assassin! slain by that same sword That was descending on his curst employer, When entering thou beheld'st Sarolta rescued! Casimir. Strange providence! what then was he who fled me? Thy looks speak fearful things! Whither, old man! Would thy hand point me? Old Bathory. Casimir, to thy father. Casimir. The curse! the curse! Open and swallow me, Unsteady earth! Fall, dizzy rocks! and hide me! Old Bathory. Speak, speak, my lord! Kiuprili. Bid him fulfil his work! Casimir. Thou art Heaven's immediate minister, dread spirit! O for sweet mercy, take some other form, And save me from perdition and despair! Old Bathory. He lives! Casimir. Lives! A father's curse can never die! Kiuprili. O Casimir! Casimir! Old Bathory. Look! he doth forgive you! Hark! 'tis the tyrant's voice. [Emerick's voice without. Casimir. I kneel, I kneel! Retract thy curse! O, by my mother's ashes, Have pity on thy self-abhorring child! If not for me, yet for my innocent wife, Yet for my country's sake, give my arm strength, Permitting me again to call thee father! Kiuprili. Son, I forgive thee! Take thy father's sword; When thou shalt lift it in thy country's cause, In that same instant doth thy father bless thee! Enter Emerick. Emerick. Fools! Cowards! follow—or by Hell I'll make you Find reason to fear Emerick, more than all The mummer-fiends that ever masqueraded As gods or wood-nymphs!— Ha! 'tis done then! Our necessary villain hath proved faithful, And there lies Casimir, and our last fears! Well!—Aye, well!— And is it not well? For though grafted on us, And filled too with our sap, the deadly power Of the parent poison-tree lurked in its fibres: There was too much of Raab Kiuprili in him: The old enemy looked at me in his face, E'en when his words did flatter me with duty. Enter Casimir and Bathory. Old Bathory (aside). This way they come! Casimir (aside). Hold them in check awhile, The path is narrow! Rudolph will assist thee. Emerick (aside). And ere I ring the alarum of my sorrow, I'll scan that face once more, and murmur—Here Lies Casimir, the last of the Kiuprilis! Hell! 'tis Pestalutz! Casimir (coming forward). Yes, thou ingrate Emerick! 'Tis Pestalutz! 'tis thy trusty murderer! To quell thee more, see Raab Kiuprili's sword! Emerick. Curses on it and thee! Think'st thou that petty omen Dare whisper fear to Emerick's destiny? Ho! Treason! Treason! Casimir. Then have at thee, tyrant! [They fight. Emerick falls. Emerick. Betrayed and baffled By mine own tool!—Oh! [Dies. Casimir. Hear, hear, my Father! Thou should'st have witnessed thine own deed. O Father, Wake from that envious swoon! The tyrant's fallen! Thy sword hath conquered! As I lifted it Thy blessing did indeed descend upon me; Dislodging the dread curse. It flew forth from me And lighted on the tyrant! Enter Rudolph, Bathory, and Attendants. Rudolph and Bathory. Friends! friends to Casimir! Casimir. Rejoice, Illyrians! the usurper's fallen. Rudolph. So perish tyrants! so end usurpation! Casimir. Bear hence the body, and move slowly on! One moment— Devoted to a joy, that bears no witness, I follow you, and we will greet our countrymen With the two best and fullest gifts of heaven— A tyrant fallen, a patriot chief restored! [Casimir enters the Cavern. Scene.—Chamber in Casimir's Castle. Confederates discovered. First Confederate. It cannot but succeed, friends. From this palace E'en to the wood, our messengers are posted With such short interspace, that fast as sound Can travel to us, we shall learn the event! Enter another Confederate. What tidings from Temeswar? Second Confederate. With one voice Th' assembled chieftains have deposed the tyrant; He is proclaimed the public enemy, And the protection of the law withdrawn. First Confederate. Just doom for him, who governs without law! Is it known on whom the sov'reignty will fall? Second Confederate. Nothing is yet decided: but report Points to Lord Casimir. The grateful memory Of his renownéd father— Enter Sarolta. Hail to Sarolta! Sarolta. Confederate friends! I bring to you a joy Worthy your noble cause! Kiuprili lives, And from his obscure exile, hath returned To bless our country. More and greater tidings Might I disclose; but that a woman's voice Would mar the wondrous tale. Wait we for him, The partner of the glory—Raab Kiuprili; For he alone is worthy to announce it. [Shouts of ‘Kiuprili, Kiuprili,’ and ‘The Tyrant's fallen,’ without. Enter Kiuprili, Casimir, Rudolph, Bathory, and Attendants. Raab Kiuprili. Spare yet your joy, my friends! A higher waits you: Behold, your Queen! [Enter Zapolya and Andreas royally attired, with Glycine. Confederate. Comes she from heaven to bless us? Other Confederates. It is! it is! Zapolya. Heaven's work of grace is full! Kiuprili, thou art safe! Raab Kiuprili. Royal Zapolya! To the heavenly powers, pay we our duty first; Who not alone preserved thee, but for thee And for our country, the one precious branch Of Andreas' royal house. O countrymen, Behold your King! And thank our country's genius, That the same means which have preserved our sovereign, Have likewise reared him worthier of the throne By virtue than by birth. The undoubted proofs Pledged by his royal mother, and this old man, (Whose name henceforth be dear to all Illyrians) We haste to lay before the assembled council. All. Hail, Andreas! Hail, Illyria's rightful king! Andreas. Supported thus, O friends! 'twere cowardice Unworthy of a royal birth, to shrink From the appointed charge. Yet, while we wait The awful sanction of convened Illyria, In this brief while, O let me feel myself The child, the friend, the debtor!—Heroic mother!— But what can breath add to that sacred name? Kiuprili! gift of Providence, to teach us That loyalty is but the public form Of the sublimest friendship, let my youth Climb round thee, as the vine around its elm: Thou my support and I thy faithful fruitage. My heart is full, and these poor words express not, They are but an art to check its over-swelling. Bathory! shrink not from my filial arms! Now, and from henceforth thou shalt not forbid me To call thee father! And dare I forget The powerful intercession of thy virtue, Lady Sarolta? Still acknowledge me Thy faithful soldier!—But what invocation Shall my full soul address to thee, Glycine? Thou sword that leap'dst forth from a bed of roses: Thou falcon-hearted dove? Zapolya. Hear that from me, son! For ere she lived, her father saved thy life, Thine, and thy fugitive mother's! Casimir. Chef Ragozzi! O shame upon my head! I would have given her To a base slave! Zapolya. Heaven overruled thy purpose, And sent an angel to thy house to guard her! Thou precious bark! freighted with all our treasures! The sports of tempests, and yet ne'er the victim, How many may claim salvage in thee! Take her, son! A queen that brings with her a richer dowry Than orient kings can give! Sarolta. A banquet waits!— On this auspicious day, for some few hours I claim to be your hostess. Scenes so awful With flashing light, force wisdom on us all! E'en women at the distaff hence may see, That bad men may rebel, but ne'er be free; May whisper, when the waves of faction foam, None love their country, but who love their home; For freedom can with those alone abide, Who wear the golden chain, with honest pride, Of love and duty, at their own fire-side: While mad ambition ever doth caress Its own sure fate, in its own restlessness!

But Heaven that brings out good from evil, And loves to disappoint the Devil, Had predetermined to restore Twofold all Job had before, His children, camels, horses, cows,— Short-sighted Devil, not to take his spouse! 20 ON THE SICKNESS OF A GREAT MINISTER Pluto commanded death to take away Billy—Death made pretences to obey, And only made pretences, for he shot A headless dart that struck nor wounded not. The ghaunt Economist who (tho' my grandam Thinks otherwise) ne'er shoots his darts at random Mutter'd, ‘What? put my Billy in arrest? Upon my life that were a pretty jest! So flat a thing of Death shall ne'er be said or sung No! Ministers and Quacks, them take I not so young.’ 21 [TO A VIRTUOUS OECONOMIST] Wernicke You're careful o'er your wealth 'tis true: Yet so that of your plenteous store The needy takes and blesses you, For you hate Poverty, but not the Poor. 22 [L'ENFANT PRODIGUE] Jack drinks fine wines, wears modish clothing, But prithee where lies Jack's estate? In Algebra for there I found of late A quantity call'd less than nothing. 23 ON SIR RUBICUND NASO A COURT ALDERMAN AND WHISPERER OF SECRETS Speak out, Sir! you're safe, for so ruddy your nose That, talk where you will, 'tis all under the Rose. 24 TO MR. PYE On his Carmen Seculare (a title which has by various persons who have heard it, been thus translated, ‘A Poem an age long’). Your Poem must eternal be, Eternal! it can't fail, For 'tis incomprehensible, And without head or tail! 25 [NINETY-EIGHT] O would the Baptist come again And preach aloud with might and main Repentance to our viperous race! But should this miracle take place, I hope, ere Irish ground he treads, He'll lay in a good stock of heads! 26 OCCASIONED BY THE FORMER I hold of all our viperous race The greedy creeping things in place Most vile, most venomous; and then The United Irishmen! To come on earth should John determine, Imprimis, we'll excuse his sermon. Without a word the good old Dervis Might work incalculable service, At once from tyranny and riot Save laws, lives, liberties and moneys, If sticking to his ancient diet He'd but eat up our locusts and wild honeys! 27 [A LIAR BY PROFESSION] As Dick and I at Charing Cross were walking, Whom should we see on t'other side pass by But Informator with a stranger talking, So I exclaim'd, ‘Lord, what a lie!’ Quoth Dick—‘What, can you hear him?’ ‘Hear him! stuff! I saw him open his mouth—an't that enough?’ 28 TO A PROUD PARENT Thy babes ne'er greet thee with the father's name; ‘My Lud!’ they lisp. Now whence can this arise? Perhaps their mother feels an honest shame And will not teach her infant to tell lies. 29 RUFA Thy lap-dog, Rufa, is a dainty beast, It don't surprise me in the least To see thee lick so dainty clean a beast. But that so dainty clean a beast licks thee, Yes—that surprises me. 30 ON A VOLUNTEER SINGER Swans sing before they die—'twere no bad thing Should certain persons die before they sing. 31 OCCASIONED BY THE LAST A joke (cries Jack) without a sting— Post obitum can no man sing. And true, if Jack don't mend his manners And quit the atheistic banners, Post obitum will Jack run foul Of such folks as can only howl. 32 EPITAPH ON MAJOR DIEMAN Know thou who walks't by, Man! that wrapp'd up in lead, man, What once was a Dieman, now lies here a dead man. Alive a proud Major! but ah me! of our poor all, The soul having gone, he is now merely Corporal. 33 ON THE ABOVE As long as ere the life-blood's running, Say, what can stop a Punster's punning? He dares bepun even thee, O Death! To punish him, Stop thou his breath. 34 EPITAPH ON A BAD MAN Of him that in this gorgeous tomb doth lie, This sad brief tale is all that Truth can give— He lived like one who never thought to die, He died like one who dared not hope to live! ANOTHER VERSION Under this stone does Walter Harcourt lie, Who valued nought that God or man could give; He lived as if he never thought to die; He died as if he dared not hope to live! Obiit Saturday, Sept. 10, 1830. W. H. EHEU! Beneath this stone does William Hazlitt lie, Thankless of all that God or man could give. He lived like one who never thought to die, He died like one who dared not hope to live. 35 TO A CERTAIN MODERN NARCISSUS Do call, dear Jess, whene'er my way you come; My looking-glass will always be at home. 36 TO A CRITIC WHO EXTRACTED A PASSAGE FROM A POEM WITHOUT ADDING A WORD RESPECTING THE CONTEXT, AND THEN DERIDED IT AS UNINTELLIGIBLE. Most candid critic, what if I, By way of joke, pull out your eye, And holding up the fragment, cry, ‘Ha! ha! that men such fools should be! Behold this shapeless Dab!—and he Who own'd it, fancied it could see!’ The joke were mighty analytic, But should you like it, candid critic? 37 ALWAYS AUDIBLE Pass under Jack's window at twelve at night You'll hear him still—he's roaring! Pass under Jack's window at twelve at noon, You'll hear him still—he's snoring! 38 PONDERE NON NUMBERO Friends should be weigh'd, not told; who boasts to have won A multitude of friends, he ne'er had one. 39 THE COMPLIMENT QUALIFIED To wed a fool, I really cannot see Why thou, Eliza, art so very loth; Still on a par with other pairs you'd be, Since thou hast wit and sense enough for both. 40 [The twenty-one ‘Original Epigrams’ following were printed in the Morning Post, in September and October, 1802, over the signature ‘??????.’ They were included in Essays, &amp;c., iii. 978-86, and were first collected in P. and D. W., 1877, ii. 171-8.] What is an Epigram? a dwarfish whole, Its body brevity, and wit its soul. 41 Charles, grave or merry, at no lie would stick, And taught at length his memory the same trick. Believing thus what he so oft repeats, He's brought the thing to such a pass, poor youth, That now himself and no one else he cheats, Save when unluckily he tells the truth. 42 An evil spirit's on thee, friend! of late! Ev'n from the hour thou cam'st to thy Estate. Thy mirth all gone, thy kindness, thy discretion, Th' estate hath prov'd to thee a most complete possession. Shame, shame, old friend! would'st thou be truly best, Be thy wealth's Lord, not slave! possessor not possess'd. 43 Here lies the Devil—ask no other name. Well—but you mean Lord—? Hush! we mean the same. 44 TO ONE WHO PUBLISHED IN PRINT WHAT HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED TO HIM BY MY FIRESIDE Two things hast thou made known to half the nation, My secrets and my want of penetration: For O! far more than all which thou hast penn'd It shames me to have call'd a wretch, like thee, my friend! 45 ‘Obscuri sub luce maligna.’ —Virg. Scarce any scandal, but has a handle; In truth most falsehoods have their rise; Truth first unlocks Pandora's box, And out there fly a host of lies. Malignant light, by cloudy night, To precipices it decoys one! One nectar-drop from Jove's own shop Will flavour a whole cup of poison. 46 Old Harpy jeers at castles in the air, And thanks his stars, whenever Edmund speaks, That such a dupe as that is not his heir— But know, old Harpy! that these fancy freaks, Though vain and light, as floating gossamer, Always amuse, and sometimes mend the heart: A young man's idlest hopes are still his pleasures, And fetch a higher price in Wisdom's mart Than all the unenjoying Miser's treasures. 47 TO A VAIN YOUNG LADY Didst thou think less of thy dear self Far more would others think of thee! Sweet Anne! the knowledge of thy wealth Reduces thee to poverty. Boon Nature gave wit, beauty, health, On thee as on her darling pitching; Couldst thou forget thou'rt thus enrich'd That moment would'st thou become rich in! And wert thou not so self-bewitch'd, Sweet Anne! thou wert, indeed, bewitching. 48 A HINT TO PREMIERS AND FIRST CONSULS FROM AN OLD TRAGEDY, VIZ. AGATHA TO KING ARCHELAUS Three truths should make thee often think and pause; The first is, that thou govern'st over men; The second, that thy power is from the laws; And this the third, that thou must die!—and then?— 49 From me, Aurelia! you desired Your proper praise to know; Well! you're the Fair by all admired— Some twenty years ago. 50 FOR A HOUSE-DOG'S COLLAR When thieves come, I bark: when gallants, I am still— So perform both my Master's and Mistress's will. 51 In vain I praise thee, Zoilus! In vain thou rail'st at me! Me no one credits, Zoilus! And no one credits thee! 52 EPITAPH ON A MERCENARY MISER A poor benighted Pedlar knock'd One night at Sell-all's door, The same who saved old Sell-all's life— 'Twas but the year before! And Sell-all rose and let him in, Not utterly unwilling, But first he bargain'd with the man, And took his only shilling! That night he dreamt he'd given away his pelf, Walk'd in his sleep, and sleeping hung himself! And now his soul and body rest below; And here they say his punishment and fate is To lie awake and every hour to know How many people read his tombstone gratis. 53 A DIALOGUE BETWEEN AN AUTHOR AND HIS FRIEND Author. Come; your opinion of my manuscript! Friend. Dear Joe! I would almost as soon be whipt. Author. But I will have it! Friend. If it must be had— (hesitating) You write so ill, I scarce could read the hand— Author. A mere evasion! Friend. And you spell so bad, That what I read I could not understand. 54 ????????? OR WISDOM IN FOLLY Tom Slothful talks, as slothful Tom beseems, What he shall shortly gain and what be doing, Then drops asleep, and so prolongs his dreams And thus enjoys at once what half the world are wooing. 55 Each Bond-street buck conceits, unhappy elf! He shews his clothes! Alas! he shews himself. O that they knew, these overdrest self-lovers, What hides the body oft the mind discovers. 56 FROM AN OLD GERMAN POET That France has put us oft to rout With powder, which ourselves found out; And laughs at us for fools in print, Of which our genius was the Mint; All this I easily admit, For we have genius, France has wit. But 'tis too bad, that blind and mad To Frenchmen's wives each travelling German goes, Expands his manly vigour by their sides, Becomes the father of his country's foes And turns their warriors oft to parricides. 57 ON THE CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE, THAT IN THE GERMAN LANGUAGE THE SUN IS FEMININE, AND THE MOON MASCULINE Our English poets, bad and good, agree To make the Sun a male, the Moon a she. He drives his dazzling diligence on high. In verse, as constantly as in the sky; And cheap as blackberries our sonnets shew The Moon, Heaven's huntress, with her silver bow; By which they'd teach us, if I guess aright, Man rules the day, and woman rules the night. In Germany, they just reverse the thing; The Sun becomes a queen, the Moon a king. Now, that the Sun should represent the women, The Moon the men, to me seem'd mighty humming; And when I first read German, made me stare. Surely it is not that the wives are there As common as the Sun, to lord and loon, And all their husbands hornéd as the Moon. 58 SPOTS IN THE SUN My father confessor is strict and holy, Mi Fili, still he cries, peccare noli. And yet how oft I find the pious man At Annette's door, the lovely courtesan! Her soul's deformity the good man wins And not her charms! he comes to hear her sins! Good father! I would fain not do thee wrong; But ah! I fear that they who oft and long Stand gazing at the sun, to count each spot, Must sometimes find the sun itself too hot. 59 When Surface talks of other people's worth He has the weakest memory on earth! And when his own good deeds he deigns to mention, His memory still is no whit better grown; But then he makes up for it, all will own, By a prodigious talent of invention. 60 TO MY CANDLE THE FAREWELL EPIGRAM Good Candle, thou that with thy brother, Fire, Art my best friend and comforter at night, Just snuff'd, thou look'st as if thou didst desire That I on thee an epigram should write. Dear Candle, burnt down to a finger-joint, Thy own flame is an epigram of sight; 'Tis short, and pointed, and all over light, Yet gives most light and burns the keenest at the point. Valete et Plaudite. 61 EPITAPH ON HIMSELF Here sleeps at length poor Col., and without screaming— Who died as he had always lived, a-dreaming: Shot dead, while sleeping, by the Gout within— Alone, and all unknown, at E'nbro' in an Inn. 62 THE TASTE OF THE TIMES Some whim or fancy pleases every eye; For talents premature 'tis now the rage: In Music how great Handel would have smil'd T' have seen what crowds are raptur'd with a child! A Garrick we have had in little Betty— And now we're told we have a Pitt in Petty! All must allow, since thus it is decreed, He is a very petty Pitt indeed! ?1806. 63 ON PITT AND FOX Britannia's boast, her glory and her pride, Pitt in his Country's service lived and died: At length resolv'd, like Pitt had done, to do, For once to serve his Country, Fox died too! 64 An excellent adage commands that we should Relate of the dead that alone which is good; But of the great Lord who here lies in lead We know nothing good but that he is dead. 65 COMPARATIVE BREVITY OF GREEK AND ENGLISH ?????? ???? ????? ????? ??????, ????? ?? ?????? ?? ????? ??? ????? ???? ?? ???? ?????? Jack finding gold left a rope on the ground: Bill missing his gold used the rope which he found. 66 EPIGRAM ON THE SECRECY OF A CERTAIN LADY ‘She's secret as the grave, allow!’ ‘I do; I cannot doubt it. But 'tis a grave with tombstone on, That tells you all about it.’ 67 MOTTO FOR A TRANSPARENCY DESIGNED BY WASHINGTON ALLSTON AND EXHIBITED AT BRISTOL ON ‘PROCLAMATION DAY’ —June 29, 1814. We've fought for Peace, and conquer'd it at last, The rav'ning vulture's leg seems fetter'd fast! Britons, rejoice! and yet be wary too: The chain may break, the clipt wing sprout anew. ANOTHER VERSION We've conquered us a Peace, like lads true metalled: And Bankrupt Nap's accounts seem all now settled. 68 Money, I've heard a wise man say, Makes herself wings and flies away— Ah! would she take it in her head To make a pair for me instead. 69 MODERN CRITICS No private grudge they need, no personal spite, The viva sectio is its own delight! All enmity, all envy, they disclaim, Disinterested thieves of our good name— Cool, sober murderers of their neighbours' fame! 70 WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM Parry seeks the Polar ridge, Rhymes seeks S. T. Coleridge, Author of Works, whereof—tho' not in Dutch— The public little knows—the publisher too much. 71 TO A LADY WHO REQUESTED ME TO WRITE A POEM UPON NOTHING On nothing, Fanny, shall I write? Shall I not one charm of thee indite? The Muse is most unruly, And vows to sing of what's more free, More soft, more beautiful than thee;— And that is Nothing, truly! 72 SENTIMENTAL The rose that blushes like the morn, Bedecks the valleys low; And so dost thou, sweet infant corn, My Angelina's toe. But on the rose there grows a thorn That breeds disastrous woe; And so dost thou, remorseless corn, On Angelina's toe. 73 So Mr. Baker heart did pluck— And did a-courting go! And Mr. Baker is a buck; For why? he needs the doe. 74 AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS ‘A heavy wit shall hang at every lord,’ So sung Dan Pope; but 'pon my word, He was a story-teller, Or else the times have altered quite; For wits, or heavy, now, or light Hang each by a bookseller. S. T. C. 75 THE ALTERNATIVE This way or that, ye Powers above me! I of my grief were rid— Did Enna either really love me, Or cease to think she did. 76 In Spain, that land of Monks and Apes, The thing called Wine doth come from grapes, But on the noble River Rhine, The thing called Gripes doth come from Wine! 77 INSCRIPTION FOR A TIME-PIECE Now! It is gone—Our brief hours travel post, Each with its thought or deed, its Why or How:— But know, each parting hour gives up a ghost To dwell within thee—an eternal Now! 78 ON THE MOST VERACIOUS ANECDOTIST, AND SMALL-TALK MAN, THOMAS HILL, ESQ. Tom Hill, who laughs at Cares and Woes, As nauci—nili—pili— What is he like, as I suppose? Why, to be sure, a Rose—a Rose. At least, no soul that Tom Hill knows Could e'er recall a Li-ly. 79 Nothing speaks our mind so well As to speak Nothing. Come then, tell Thy Mind in Tears, whoe'er thou be That ow'st a name to Misery: None can fluency deny To Tears, the Language of the Eye. 80 EPITAPH OF THE PRESENT YEAR ON THE MONUMENT OF THOMAS FULLER A Lutheran stout, I hold for Goose-and-Gaundry Both the Pope's Limbo and his fiery Laundry: No wit e'er saw I in Original Sin, And no Sin find I in Original Wit; But if I'm all in the wrong, and, Grin for Grin, Scorch'd Souls must pay for each too lucky hit,— Oh, Fuller! much I fear, so vast thy debt, Thou art not out of Purgatory yet; Tho' one, eight, three and three this year is reckon'd, And thou, I think, didst die sub Charles the Second. JEUX D'ESPRIT 1 MY GODMOTHER'S BEARD So great the charms of Mrs. Mundy, That men grew rude, a kiss to gain: This so provok'd the dame that one day To Pallas chaste she did complain: Nor vainly she address'd her prayer, Nor vainly to that power applied; The goddess bade a length of hair In deep recess her muzzle hide: Still persevere! to love be callous! For I have your petition heard! To snatch a kiss were vain (cried Pallas) Unless you first should shave your beard. ? 1791. 2 LINES TO THOMAS POOLE [Quoted in a letter from Coleridge to John Thelwall, dated Dec. 17, 1796.] . . . . Joking apart, I would to God we could sit by a fireside and joke vivâ voce, face to face—Stella [Mrs. Thelwall] and Sara [Mrs. S. T. Coleridge], Jack Thelwall and I!—as I once wrote to my dear friend T. Poole,— Repeating Such verse as Bowles, heart honour'd Poet sang, That wakes the Tear, yet steals away the Pang, Then, or with Berkeley, or with Hobbes romance it, Dissecting Truth with metaphysic lancet. Or, drawn from up these dark unfathom'd wells, In wiser folly chink the Cap and Bells. How many tales we told! what jokes we made, Conundrum, Crambo, Rebus, or Charade; Ænigmas that had driven the Theban mad, And Puns, these best when exquisitely bad; And I, if aught of archer vein I hit, With my own laughter stifled my own wit. 1796. 3 TO A WELL-KNOWN MUSICAL CRITIC, REMARKABLE FOR HIS EARS STICKING THROUGH HIS HAIR. O —! O —! of you we complain For exposing those ears to the wind and the rain. Thy face, a huge whitlow just come to a head, Ill agrees with those ears so raw and so red. A Musical Critic of old fell a-pouting When he saw how his asinine honours were sprouting; But he hid 'em quite snug, in a full friz of hair, And the Barber alone smoked his donkeys [so] rare. Thy judgment much worse, and thy perkers as ample, O give heed to King Midas, and take his example. Thus to publish your fate is as useless as wrong— You but prove by your ears, what we guessed from your tongue. Laberius. 4 TO T. POOLE AN INVITATION Plucking flowers from the Galaxy On the pinions of Abstraction, I did quite forget to ax'e, Whether you have an objaction, With us to swill'e and to swell'e And make a pig-stie of your belly. A lovely limb most dainty Of a ci-devant Mud-raker, I makes bold to acquaint'e We've trusted to the Baker: And underneath it satis Of the subterrene apple By the erudite 'clep'd taties— With which, if you'ld wish to grapple, As sure as I'm a sloven, The clock will not strike twice one, When the said dish will be out of the oven, And the dinner will be a nice one. P.S. Besides we've got some cabbage. You Jew-dog, if you linger, May the Itch in pomp of scabbage Pop out between each finger. January, 1797. 5 SONG TO BE SUNG BY THE LOVERS OF ALL THE NOBLE LIQUORS COMPRISED UNDER THE NAME OF ALE. A. Ye drinkers of Stingo and Nappy so free, Are the Gods on Olympus so happy as we? B. They cannot be so happy! For why? they drink no Nappy. A. But what if Nectar, in their lingo, Is but another name for Stingo? B. Why, then we and the Gods are equally blest, And Olympus an Ale-house as good as the best! 6 DRINKING versus THINKING OR, A SONG AGAINST THE NEW PHILOSOPHY My Merry men all, that drink with glee This fanciful Philosophy, Pray tell me what good is it? If antient Nick should come and take, The same across the Stygian Lake, I guess we ne'er should miss it. Away, each pale, self-brooding spark That goes truth-hunting in the dark, Away from our carousing! To Pallas we resign such fowls— Grave birds of wisdom! ye're but owls, And all your trade but mousing! My merry men all, here's punch and wine, And spicy bishop, drink divine! Let's live while we are able. While Mirth and Sense sit, hand in glove, This Don Philosophy we'll shove Dead drunk beneath the table! 7 THE WILLS OF THE WISP A SAPPHIC Vix ea nostra voco Lunatic Witch-fires! Ghosts of Light and Motion! Fearless I see you weave your wanton dances Near me, far off me; you, that tempt the traveller Onward and onward. Wooing, retreating, till the swamp beneath him Groans—and 'tis dark!—This woman's wile—I know it! Learnt it from thee, from thy perfidious glances! Black-ey'd Rebecca! 8 TO CAPTAIN FINDLAY When the squalls were flitting and fleering And the vessel was tacking and veering; Bravo! Captain Findlay, Who foretold a fair wind Of a constant mind; For he knew which way the wind lay, Bravo! Captain Findlay. A Health to Captain Findlay, Bravo! Captain Findlay! When we made but ill speed with the Speedwell, Neither poets nor sheep could feed well: Now grief rotted the Liver, Yet Malta, dear Malta, as far off as ever! Bravo! Captain Findlay, Foretold a fair wind, Of a constant mind, For he knew which way the wind lay! May 4, 1804. 9 ON DONNE'S POEM ‘TO A FLEA’ Be proud as Spaniards! Leap for pride ye Fleas! Henceforth in Nature's mimic World grandees. In Phœbus' archives registered are ye, And this your patent of Nobility. No skip-Jacks now, nor civiller skip-Johns, Dread Anthropophagi! specks of living bronze, I hail you one and all, sans Pros or Cons, Descendants from a noble race of Dons. What tho' that great ancestral Flea be gone, Immortal with immortalising Donne, His earthly spots bleached off a Papist's gloze, In purgatory fire on Bardolph's nose. 1811. 10 [EX LIBRIS S. T.

The following burlesque on the Fichtean Egoismus may, perhaps, be amusing to the few who have studied the system, and to those who are unacquainted with it, may convey as tolerable a likeness of Fichte's idealism as can be expected from an avowed caricature. [S. T. C.] The Categorical Imperative, or the annunciation of the New Teutonic God, ???????????: a dithyrambic Ode, by Querkopf Von Klubstick, Grammarian, and Subrector in Gymnasio. ... Eu! Dei vices gerens, ipse Divus, (Speak English, Friend!) the God Imperativus, Here on this market-cross aloud I cry: ‘I, I, I! I itself I! The form and the substance, the what and the why, The when and the where, and the low and the high, The inside and outside, the earth and the sky, I, you, and he, and he, you and I, All souls and all bodies are I itself I! All I itself I! (Fools! a truce with this starting!) All my I! all my I! He's a heretic dog who but adds Betty Martin!’ Thus cried the God with high imperial tone: In robe of stiffest state, that scoff'd at beauty, A pronoun-verb imperative he shone— Then substantive and plural-singular grown, He thus spake on:—‘Behold in I alone (For Ethics boast a syntax of their own) Or if in ye, yet as I doth depute ye, In O! I, you, the vocative of duty! I of the world's whole Lexicon the root! Of the whole universe of touch, sound, sight, The genitive and ablative to boot: The accusative of wrong, the nom'native of right, And in all cases the case absolute! Self-construed, I all other moods decline: Imperative, from nothing we derive us; Yet as a super-postulate of mine, Unconstrued antecedence I assign, To X Y Z, the God Infinitivus!’ 1815. 12 THE BRIDGE STREET COMMITTEE Jack Snipe Eats Tripe: It is therefore credible That tripe is edible. And therefore, perforce, It follows, of course, That the Devil will gripe All who do not eat Tripe. And as Nic is too slow To fetch 'em below: And Gifford, the attorney, Won't quicken their journey; The Bridge-Street Committee That colleague without pity, To imprison and hang Carlile and his gang, Is the pride of the City, And 'tis Association That, alone, saves the Nation From Death and Damnation. 13 NONSENSE SAPPHICS Here's Jem's first copy of nonsense verses, All in the antique style of Mistress Sappho, Latin just like Horace the tuneful Roman, Sapph's imitator: But we Bards, we classical Lyric Poets, Know a thing or two in a scurvy Planet: Don't we, now? Eh? Brother Horatius Flaccus, Tip us your paw, Lad:— Here's to Mæcenas and the other worthies; Rich men of England! would ye be immortal? Patronise Genius, giving Cash and Praise to Gillman Jacobus; Gillman Jacobus, he of Merchant Taylors', Minor ætate, ingenio at stupendus, Sapphic, Heroic, Elegiac,—what a Versificator! 14 TO SUSAN STEELE ON RECEIVING THE PURSE EXTRUMPERY LINES My dearest Dawtie! That's never naughty— When the Mare was stolen, and not before, The wise man got a stable-door: And he and I are brother Ninnies, One Beast he lost and I two guineas; And as sure as it's wet when it above rains, The man's brains and mine both alike had thick coverings, For if he lost one mare, poor I lost two sovereigns! A cash-pouch I have got, but no cash to put in it, Tho' there's gold in the world and Sir Walter can win it: For your sake I'll keep it for better or worse, So here is a dear loving kiss for your purse. S. T. Coleridge. 1829. 15 ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS I.—By Likeness Fond, peevish, wedded pair! why all this rant? O guard your tempers! hedge your tongues about This empty head should warn you on that point— The teeth were quarrelsome, and so fell out. S. T. C. II.—Association by Contrast Phidias changed marble into feet and legs. Disease! vile anti-Phidias! thou, i' fegs! Hast turned my live limbs into marble pegs. III.—Association by Time SIMPLICIUS SNIPKIN loquitur I touch this scar upon my skull behind, And instantly there rises in my mind Napoleon's mighty hosts from Moscow lost, Driven forth to perish in the fangs of Frost. For in that self-same month, and self-same day, Down Skinner Street I took my hasty way— Mischief and Frost had set the boys at play; I stept upon a slide—oh! treacherous tread!— Fell smash with bottom bruised, and brake my head! Thus Time's co-presence links the great and small, Napoleon's overthrow, and Snipkin's fall. ? 1830. 16 VERSES TRIVOCULAR Of one scrap of science I've evidence ocular. A heart of one chamber they call unilocular, And in a sharp frost, or when snow-flakes fall floccular, Your wise man of old wrapp'd himself in a Roquelaure, Which was called a Wrap-rascal when folks would be jocular. And shell-fish, the small, Periwinkle and Cockle are, So with them will I finish these verses trivocular. 17 CHOLERA CURED BEFORE-HAND Or a premonition promulgated gratis for the use of the Useful Classes, specially those resident in St. Giles's, Saffron Hill, Bethnal Green, etc.; and likewise, inasmuch as the good man is merciful even to the beasts, for the benefit of the Bulls and Bears of the Stock Exchange. Pains ventral, subventral, In stomach or entrail, Think no longer mere prefaces For grins, groans, and wry faces; But off to the doctor, fast as ye can crawl! Yet far better 'twould be not to have them at all. Now to 'scape inward aches, Eat no plums nor plum-cakes; Cry avaunt! new potato— And don't drink, like old Cato. Ah! beware of Dispipsy, And don't ye get tipsy! For tho' gin and whiskey May make you feel frisky, They're but crimps to Dispipsy; And nose to tail, with this gipsy Comes, black as a porpus, The diabolus ipse, Call'd Cholery Morpus; Who with horns, hoofs, and tail, croaks for carrion to feed him, Tho' being a Devil, no one never has seed him! Ah! then my dear honies, There's no cure for you For loves nor for monies:— You'll find it too true. Och! the hallabaloo! Och! och! how you'll wail, When the offal-fed vagrant Shall turn you as blue As the gas-light unfragrant, That gushes in jets from beneath his own tail;— 'Till swift as the mail, He at last brings the cramps on, That will twist you like Samson. So without further blethring, Dear mudlarks! my brethren! Of all scents and degrees, (Yourselves and your shes) Forswear all cabal, lads, Wakes, unions, and rows, Hot dreams and cold salads, And don't pig in styes that would suffocate sows! Quit Cobbett's, O'Connell's and Beelzebub's banners, And whitewash at once bowels, rooms, hands, and manners! 18 TO BABY BATES You come from o'er the waters, From famed Columbia's land, And you have sons and daughters, And money at command. But I live in an island, Great Britain is its name, With money none to buy land, The more it is the shame. But we are all the children Of one great God of Love, Whose mercy like a mill-drain Runs over from above. Lullaby, lullaby, Sugar-plums and cates, Close your little peeping eye, Bonny Baby B—s. 19 TO A CHILD Little Miss Fanny, So cubic and canny, With blue eyes and blue shoes— The Queen of the Blues! As darling a girl as there is in the world— If she'll laugh, skip and jump, And not be Miss Glump! 1834. FRAGMENTS FROM A NOTEBOOK Fragments in prose have been omitted. Circa 1796–98 1 Light cargoes waft of modulated Sound From viewless Hybla brought, when Melodies Like Birds of Paradise on wings, that aye Disport in wild variety of hues, Murmur around the honey-dropping flower. 2 Broad-breasted rock—hanging cliff that glasses His rugged forehead in the calmy sea. 3 Where Cam his stealthy flowings most dissembles And scarce the Willow's watery shadow trembles. 4 With secret hand heal the conjectur'd wound, [or] Guess at the wound, and heal with secret hand. 5 Outmalic'd Calumny's imposthum'd Tongue. 6 And write Impromptus Spurring their Pegasus to tortoise gallop. 7 Due to the Staggerers, that made drunk by Power Forget thirst's eager promise, and presume, Dark Dreamers! that the world forgets it too. 8 Perish warmth Unfaithful to its seeming! 9 Old age, ‘the shape and messenger of Death,’ ‘His wither'd Fist still knocking at Death's door.’ 10 God no distance knows, All of the whole possessing! 12 And cauldrons the scoop'd earth, a boiling sea. 13 Rush on my ear, a cataract of sound. 14 The guilty pomp, consuming while it flares. 15 My heart seraglios a whole host of Joys. 16 And Pity's sigh shall answer thy tale of Anguish Like the faint echo of a distant valley. 17 A DUNGEON In darkness I remain'd—the neighb'ring clock Told me that now the rising sun shone lovely On my garden. 18 The Sun (for now his orb 'gan slowly sink) Shot half his rays aslant the heath whose flowers Purpled the mountain's broad and level top; Rich was his bed of clouds, and wide beneath Expecting Ocean smiled with dimpled face. 19 Leanness, disquietude, and secret Pangs. 20 Smooth, shining, and deceitful as thin Ice. 21 Wisdom, Mother of retired Thought. 22 Nature wrote Rascal on his face, By chalcographic art! 23 In this world we dwell among the tombs And touch the pollutions of the Dead. 24 The mild despairing of a Heart resigned. 25 Such fierce vivacity as fires the eye Of Genius fancy-craz'd. 26 — like a mighty Giantess Seiz'd in sore travail and prodigious birth Sick Nature struggled: long and strange her pangs; Her groans were horrible, but O! most fair The Twins she bore—Equality and Peace! 27 Discontent Mild as an infant low-plaining in its sleep. 28 — terrible and loud, As the strong Voice that from the Thunder-cloud Speaks to the startled Midnight. 29 The swallows Interweaving there, mid the pair'd sea-mews At distance wildly-wailing! 30 The Brook runs over sea-weeds. Sabbath day—from the Miller's merry wheel The water-drops dripp'd leisurely. 31 On the broad mountain-top The neighing wild-colt races with the wind O'er fern and heath-flowers. 32 A long deep lane So overshadow'd, it might seem one bower— The damp clay-banks were furr'd with mouldy moss. 33 Broad-breasted Pollards, with broad-branching heads. 34 'Twas sweet to know it only possible— Some wishes cross'd my mind and dimly cheer'd it— And one or two poor melancholy Pleasures— In these, the pale unwarming light of Hope Silv'ring their flimsy wing, flew silent by, Moths in the Moonlight. 35 Behind the thin Grey cloud that cover'd but not hid the sky The round full moon look'd small. 36 The subtle snow In every breeze rose curling from the Grove Like pillars of cottage smoke. 37 The sunshine lies on the cottage-wall, A-shining thro' the snow. 40 The tongue can't speak when the mouth is cramm'd with earth— A little mould fills up most eloquent mouths, And a square stone with a few pious texts Cut neatly on it, keeps the mould down tight. 41 And with my whole heart sing the stately song, Loving the God that made me. 42 God's Image, Sister of the Cherubim! 43 And re-implace God's Image in the Soul. 44 And arrows steeled with wrath. 45 Lov'd the same Love, and hated the same hate, Breath'd in his soul! etc. etc. 46 O man! thou half-dead Angel! 47 Thy stern and sullen eye, and thy dark brow Chill me, like dew-damps of th' unwholesome Night. My Love, a timorous and tender flower, Closes beneath thy Touch, unkindly man! Breath'd on by gentle gales of Courtesy And cheer'd by sunshine of impassion'd look— Then opes its petals of no vulgar hues. 48 With skill that never Alchemist yet told, Made drossy Lead as ductile as pure Gold. 49 Grant me a Patron, gracious Heaven! whene'er My unwash'd follies call for Penance drear: But when more hideous guilt this heart infests Instead of fiery coals upon my Pate, O let a titled Patron be my Fate;— That fierce Compendium of Ægyptian Pests! Right reverend Dean, right honourable Squire, Lord, Marquis, Earl, Duke, Prince,—or if aught higher, However proudly nicknamed, he shall be Anathema Maránatha to me! FRAGMENTS 1 O'er the raised earth the gales of evening sigh; And, see, a daisy peeps upon its slope! I wipe the dimming waters from mine eye; Even on the cold grave lights the Cherub Hope. 2 Sea-ward, white gleaming thro' the busy scud With arching Wings, the sea-mew o'er my head Posts on, as bent on speed, now passaging Edges the stiffer Breeze, now, yielding, drifts, Now floats upon the air, and sends from far A wildly-wailing Note. 3 OVER MY COTTAGE The Pleasures sport beneath the thatch; But Prudence sits upon the watch; Nor Dun nor Doctor lifts the latch! 4 In the lame and limping metre of a barbarous Latin poet— Est meum et est tuum, amice! at si amborum nequit esse, Sit meum, amice, precor: quia certe sum mage pauper. 'Tis mine and it is likewise yours; But and if this will not do, Let it be mine, because that I Am the poorer of the Two! 5 Names do not always meet with Love, And Love wants courage without a name. 6 The Moon, how definite its orb! Yet gaze again, and with a steady gaze— 'Tis there indeed,—but where is it not?— It is suffused o'er all the sapphire Heaven, Trees, herbage, snake-like stream, unwrinkled Lake, Whose very murmur does of it partake! And low and close the broad smooth mountain is more a thing of Heaven than when distinct by one dim shade, and yet undivided from the universal cloud in which it towers infinite in height. 7 Such love as mourning Husbands have To her whose Spirit has been newly given To her guardian Saint in Heaven— Whose Beauty lieth in the grave— (Unconquered, as if the Soul could find no purer Tabernacle, nor place of sojourn than the virgin Body it had before dwelt in, and wished to stay there till the Resurrection)— Far liker to a Flower now than when alive, Cold to the Touch and blooming to the eye. 8 [THE NIGHT-MARE DEATH IN LIFE] I know 'tis but a dream, yet feel more anguish Than if 'twere truth. It has been often so: Must I die under it? Is no one near? Will no one hear these stifled groans and wake me? 9 Bright clouds of reverence, sufferably bright, That intercept the dazzle, not the Light; That veil the finite form, the boundless power reveal, Itself an earthly sun of pure intensest white. 10 A BECK IN WINTER Over the broad, the shallow, rapid stream, The Alder, a vast hollow Trunk, and ribb'd— All mossy green with mosses manifold, And ferns still waving in the river-breeze Sent out, like fingers, five projecting trunks— The shortest twice 6 (?) of a tall man's strides.— One curving upward in its middle growth Rose straight with grove of twigs—a pollard tree:— The rest more backward, gradual in descent— One in the brook and one befoamed its waters: One ran along the bank in the elk-like head And pomp of antlers— 11 I from the influence of thy Looks receive, Access in every virtue, in thy Sight More wise, more wakeful, stronger, if need were Of outward strength.— 12 What never is, but only is to be This is not Life:— O hopeless Hope, and Death's Hypocrisy! And with perpetual promise breaks its promises. 13 The silence of a City, how awful at Midnight! Mute as the battlements and crags and towers That Fancy makes in the clouds, yea, as mute As the moonlight that sleeps on the steady vanes. (or) The cell of a departed anchoret, His skeleton and flitting ghost are there, Sole tenants— And all the City silent as the Moon That steeps in quiet light the steady vanes Of her huge temples. 14 O beauty in a beauteous body dight! Body that veiling brightness, beamest bright; Fair cloud which less we see, than by thee see the light. 15 O th' Oppressive, irksome weight Felt in an uncertain state: Comfort, peace, and rest adieu Should I prove at last untrue! Self-confiding wretch, I thought I could love thee as I ought, Win thee and deserve to feel All the Love thou canst reveal, And still I chuse thee, follow still. 16 'Twas not a mist, nor was it quite a cloud, But it pass'd smoothly on towards the sea— Smoothly and lightly between Earth and Heaven: So, thin a cloud, It scarce bedimm'd the star that shone behind it: And Hesper now Paus'd on the welkin blue, and cloudless brink, A golden circlet! while the Star of Jove— That other lovely star—high o'er my head Shone whitely in the centre of his Haze . . . one black-blue cloud Stretch'd, like the heaven, o'er all the cope of Heaven. 17 [NOT A CRITIC—BUT A JUDGE] Whom should I choose for my Judge? the earnest, imper sonal reader. Who, in the work, forgets me and the world and himself! You who have eyes to detect, and Gall to Chastise the imperfect, Have you the heart, too, that loves,—feels and rewards the Compleat? 18 A sumptuous and magnificent Revenge. 19 [DE PROFUNDIS CLAMAVI] Come, come thou bleak December wind, And blow the dry leaves from the tree! Flash, like a love-thought, thro' me, Death! And take a life that wearies me. 20 As some vast Tropic tree, itself a wood, That crests its head with clouds, beneath the flood Feeds its deep roots, and with the bulging flank Of its wide base controls the fronting bank— (By the slant current's pressure scoop'd away The fronting bank becomes a foam-piled bay) High in the Fork the uncouth Idol knits His channel'd brow; low murmurs stir by fits And dark below the horrid Faquir sits— An Horror from its broad Head's branching wreath Broods o'er the rude Idolatry beneath— 21 Let Eagle bid the Tortoise sunward soar— As vainly Strength speaks to a broken Mind. 22 The body, Eternal Shadow of the finite Soul, The Soul's self-symbol, its image of itself. Its own yet not itself. 23 Or Wren or Linnet, In Bush and Bushet; No tree, but in it A cooing Cushat. 24 The reed roof'd village still bepatch'd with snow Smok'd in the sun-thaw. 25 And in Life's noisiest hour There whispers still the ceaseless love of thee, The heart's self-{solace/commune}The manuscript offers two variant readings: self-solace or, self-commune. and soliloquy. 26 You mould my Hopes you fashion me within: And to the leading love-throb in the heart, Through all my being, through my pulses beat; You lie in all my many thoughts like Light, Like the fair light of Dawn, or summer Eve, On rippling stream, or cloud-reflecting lake; And looking to the Heaven that bends above you, How oft! I bless the lot that made me love you. 27 And my heart mantles in its own delight. 28 The spruce and limber yellow-hammer In the dawn of spring and sultry summer, In hedge or tree the hours beguiling With notes as of one who brass is filing. 29 FRAGMENT OF AN ODE ON NAPOLEON O'erhung with yew, midway the Muses mount From thy sweet murmurs far, O Hippocrene! Turbid and black upboils an angry fount Tossing its shatter'd foam in vengeful spleen— Phlegethon's rage Cocytus' wailings hoarse Alternate now, now mixt, made known its headlong course: Thither with terror stricken and surprise, (For sure such haunts were ne'er to Muse's choice) Euterpe led me. Mute with asking eyes I stood expectant of her heavenly voice. Her voice entranc'd my terror and made flow In a rude understrain the maniac fount below. ‘Whene'er (the Goddess said) abhorr'd of Jove Usurping Power his hands in blood imbrues— 30 The singing Kettle and the purring Cat, The gentle breathing of the cradled Babe, The silence of the Mother's love-bright eye, And tender smile answering its smile of Sleep. 31 Two wedded hearts, if ere were such, Imprison'd in adjoining cells, Across whose thin partition-wall The builder left one narrow rent, And where, most content in discontent, A joy with itself at strife— Die into an intenser life. Another Version The builder left one narrow rent, Two wedded hearts, if ere were such, Contented most in discontent, Still there cling, and try in vain to touch! O Joy! with thy own joy at strife, That yearning for the Realm above Wouldst die into intenser Life, And Union absolute of Love! 32 Sole Maid, associate sole, to me beyond Compare all living creatures dear— Thoughts, which have found their harbour in thy heart Dearest! me thought of him to thee so dear! 33 EPIGRAM ON KEPLER FROM THE GERMAN No mortal spirit yet had clomb so high As Kepler—yet his Country saw him die For very want! the Minds alone he fed, And so the Bodies left him without bread. 34 When Hope but made Tranquillity be felt: A flight of Hope for ever on the wing But made Tranquillity a conscious thing; And wheeling round and round in sportive coil, Fann'd the calm air upon the brow of Toil. 35 I have experienced The worst the world can wreak on me—the worst That can make Life indifferent, yet disturb With whisper'd discontent the dying prayer— I have beheld the whole of all, wherein My heart had any interest in this life To be disrent and torn from off my Hopes That nothing now is left. Why then live on? That hostage that the world had in its keeping Given by me as a pledge that I would live— That hope of Her, say rather that pure Faith In her fix'd Love, which held me to keep truce With the tyranny of Life—is gone, ah! whither? What boots it to reply? 'tis gone! and now Well may I break this Pact, this league of Blood That ties me to myself—and break I shall. 36 As when the new or full Moon urges The high, large, long, unbreaking surges Of the Pacific main. 37 O mercy, O me, miserable man! Slowly my wisdom, and how slowly comes My Virtue! and how rapidly pass off My Joys! my Hopes! my Friendships, and my Love! 38 A low dead Thunder mutter'd thro' the night, As 'twere a giant angry in his sleep— Nature! sweet nurse, O take me in thy lap And tell me of my Father yet unseen, Sweet tales, and true, that lull me into sleep And leave me dreaming. 39 His own fair countenance, his kingly forehead, His tender smiles, Love's day-dawn on his lips, Put on such heavenly, spiritual light, At the same moment in his steadfast eye Were Virtue's native crest, th' innocent soul's Unconscious meek self-heraldry,—to man Genial, and pleasant to his guardian angel. He suffer'd nor complain'd;—though oft with tears He mourn'd th' oppression of his helpless brethren,— And sometimes with a deeper holier grief Mourn'd for the oppressor—but this in sabbath hours— A solemn grief, that like a cloud at sunset, Was but the veil of inward meditation Pierced thro' and saturate with the intellectual rays It soften'd. 40 [ARS POETICA] In the two following lines, for instance, there is nothing objectionable, nothing which would preclude them from forming, in their proper place, part of a descriptive poem:— ‘Behold yon row of pines, that shorn and bow'd Bend from the sea-blast, seen at twilight eve.’ But with a small alteration of rhythm, the same words would be equally in their place in a book of topography, or in a descriptive tour. The same image will rise into a semblance of poetry if thus conveyed:— ‘Yon row of bleak and visionary pines, By twilight-glimpse discerned, mark! how they flee From the fierce sea-blast, all their tresses wild Streaming before them.’ 41 TRANSLATION OF THE FIRST STROPHE OF PINDAR'S SECOND OLYMPIC ‘As nearly as possible word for word.’ Ye harp-controlling hymns! (or) Ye hymns the sovereigns of harps! What God? what Hero? What Man shall we celebrate? Truly Pisa indeed is of Jove, But the Olympiad (or, the Olympic games) did Hercules establish, The first-fruits of the spoils of war. But Theron for the four-horsed car That bore victory to him, It behoves us now to voice aloud: The Just, the Hospitable, The Bulwark of Agrigentum, Of renowned fathers The Flower, even him Who preserves his native city erect and safe. 42 O! Superstition is the giant shadow Which the solicitude of weak mortality, Its back toward Religion's rising sun, Casts on the thin mist of th' uncertain future. 43 TRANSLATION OF A FRAGMENT OF HERACLITUS Not hers To win the sense by words of rhetoric, Lip-blossoms breathing perishable sweets; But by the power of the informing Word Roll sounding onward through a thousand years Her deep prophetic bodements. 44 Truth I pursued, as Fancy sketch'd the way, And wiser men than I went worse astray. 45 IMITATED FROM ARISTOPHANES (Nubes 315, 317.) ??????? ???? ???????? ??????, ????? ?????? ??? ???????? ??? ???? ???? ????????? ??? ????????? ??? ????????? ??? ??????? ??? ?????????. For the ancients ... had their glittering vapors, which (as the comic poet tells us) fed a host of sophists.

Half of it to one were worth double the whole! 52 I stand alone, nor tho' my heart should break, Have I, to whom I may complain or speak. Here I stand, a hopeless man and sad, Who hoped to have seen my Love, my Life. And strange it were indeed, could I be glad Remembering her, my soul's betrothéd wife. For in this world no creature that has life Was e'er to me so gracious and so good. Her loss is to my Heart, like the Heart's blood. 53 NAPOLEON The Sun with gentle beams his rage disguises, And, like aspiring Tyrants, temporises— Never to be endured but when he falls or rises. 54 Thicker than rain-drops on November thorn. 55 His native accents to her stranger's ear, Skill'd in the tongues of France and Italy— Or while she warbles with bright eyes upraised, Her fingers shoot like streams of silver light Amid the golden haze of thrilling strings. 56 Each crime that once estranges from the virtues Doth make the memory of their features daily More dim and vague, till each coarse counterfeit Can have the passport to our confidence Sign'd by ourselves. And fitly are they punish'd Who prize and seek the honest man but as A safer lock to guard dishonest treasures. 57 Where'er I find the Good, the True, the Fair, I ask no names—God's spirit dwelleth there! The unconfounded, undivided Three, Each for itself, and all in each, to see In man and Nature, is Philosophy. 58 A wind that with Aurora hath abiding Among the Arabian and the Persian Hills. 59 I find the following lines among my papers, in my own writing, but whether an unfinished fragment, or a contribution to some friend's production, I know not:— What boots to tell how o'er his grave She wept, that would have died to save; Little they know the heart, who deem Her sorrow but an infant's dream Of transient love begotten; A passing gale, that as it blows Just shakes the ripe drop from the rose— That dies and is forgotten. O Woman! nurse of hopes and fears, All lovely in thy spring of years, Thy soul in blameless mirth possessing, Most lovely in affliction's tears, More lovely still than tears suppressing. 60 THE THREE SORTS OF FRIENDS My dear Gillman—The ground and matériel of this division of one's friends into ac, con and inquaintance, was given by Hartley Coleridge when he was scarcely five years old [1801]. On some one asking him if Anny Sealy (a little girl he went to school with) was an acquaintance of his, he replied, very fervently pressing his right hand on his heart, ‘No, she is an inquaintance!’ ‘Well! 'tis a father's tale’; and the recollection soothes your old friend and inquaintance, S. T. Coleridge. Though friendships differ endless in degree, The sorts, methinks, may be reduced to three. Acquaintance many, and Conquaintance few; But for Inquaintance I know only two— The friend I've mourned with, and the maid I woo! 61 If fair by Nature She honours the fair Boon with fair adorning, And graces that bespeak a gracious breeding, Can gracious Nature lessen Nature's Graces? If taught by both she betters both and honours Fair gifts with fair adorning, know you not There is a beauty that resides within;— A fine and delicate spirit of womanhood Of inward birth?— 62 BO-PEEP AND I SPY— In the corner one— I spy Love! In the corner None, I spy Love. 63 A SIMILE As the shy hind, the soft-eyed gentle Brute Now moves, now stops, approaches by degrees— At length emerges from the shelt'ring Trees, Lur'd by her Hunter with the Shepherd's flute, Whose music travelling on the twilight breeze, When all besides was mute— She oft had heard, and ever lov'd to hear; She fearful Beast! but that no sound of Fear— 64 BARON GUELPH OF ADELSTAN. A FRAGMENT For ever in the world of Fame We live and yet abide the same: Clouds may intercept our rays, Or desert Lands reflect our blaze. The beauteous Month of May began, And all was Mirth and Sport, When Baron Guelph of Adelstan Took leave and left the Court. From Fête and Rout and Opera far The full town he forsook, And changed his wand and golden star For Shepherd's Crown and Crook. The knotted net of light and shade Beneath the budding tree, A sweeter day-bed for him made Than Couch and Canopy. In copse or lane, as Choice or Chance Might lead him was he seen; And join'd at eve the village dance Upon the village green. Nor endless— METRICAL EXPERIMENTS 1 AN EXPERIMENT FOR A METRE I heard a voice pealing loud triumph to-day: The voice of the Triumph, O Freedom, was thine! Sumptuous Tyranny challeng'd the fray, ‘Drunk with Idolatry, drunk with wine.’ Whose could the Triumph be Freedom but thine? Stars of the Heaven shine to feed thee; Hush'd are the Whirl-blasts and heed thee;— By her depth, by her height, Nature swears thou art mine! 2 TROCHAICS Thus she said, and, all around, Her diviner spirit, gan to borrow; Earthly Hearings hear unearthly sound, Hearts heroic faint, and sink aswound. Welcome, welcome, spite of pain and sorrow, Love to-day, and Thought to-morrow. 3 THE PROPER UNMODIFIED DOCHMIUS (i. e. antispastic Catalectic) B?n?gn sh??t?ng st?rs, ?cst?t?c d?l?ght. or The Lord's throne in Heaven ?m?d ?ng?l troops Amid troops of Angels God throned on high. 4 IAMBICS No cold shall thee benumb, Nor darkness stain thy sight; To thee new Heat, new Light Shall from this object come, Whose Praises if thou now wilt sound aright, My Pen shall give thee leave hereafter to be dumb. 5 NONSENSE Sing impassionate Soul! of Mohammed the complicate story: Sing, unfearful of Man, groaning and ending in care. Short the Command and the Toil, but endlessly mighty the Glory! Standing aloof if it chance, vainly our enemy's scare: What tho' we wretchedly fare, wearily drawing the Breath—, Malice in wonder may stare; merrily move we to Death. 6 A PLAINTIVE MOVEMENT Go little Pipe! for ever I must leave thee, Ah, vainly true! Never, ah never! must I more receive thee? Adieu! adieu! Well, thou art gone! and what remains behind, Soothing the soul to Hope? The moaning Wind— Hide with sere leaves my Grave's undaisied Slope. 7 AN EXPERIMENT FOR A METRE When thy Beauty appears, In its graces and airs, All bright as an Angel new dight from the Sky, At distance I gaze, and am awed by my fears, So strangely you dazzle my Eye. 8 NONSENSE VERSES [AN EXPERIMENT FOR A METRE] Ye fowls of ill presage, Go vanish into Night! Let all things sweet and fair Yield homage to the pair: From Infancy to Age Each Brow be smooth and bright, As Lake in evening light. To-day be Joy! and Sorrow Devoid of Blame (The widow'd Dame) Shall welcome be to-morrow. Thou, too, dull Night! may'st come unchid: This wall of Flame the Dark hath hid With turrets each a Pyramid;— For the Tears that we shed, are Gladness, A mockery of Sadness! 9 NONSENSE [AN EXPERIMENT FOR A METRE] I wish on earth to sing Of Jove the bounteous store, That all the Earth may ring With Tale of Wrong no more. I fear no foe in field or tent, Tho' weak our cause yet strong his Grace: As Polar roamers clad in Fur, Unweeting whither we were bent We found as 'twere a native place, Where not a Blast could stir: For Jove had his Almighty Presence lent: Each eye beheld, in each transfigured Face, The radiant light of Joy, and Hope's forgotten Trace. or O then I sing Jove's bounteous store— On rushing wing while sea-mews roar, And raking Tides roll Thunder on the shore. 10 EXPERIMENTS IN METRE There in some darksome shade Methinks I'd weep Myself asleep, And there forgotten fade. 11 1.

The metre is Amphibrach dimeter Catalectic [short] [long] [short] | [short] [long], and the rhymes antistrophic.

LORD BROOKE [1] Motto to ‘A Lay Sermon’, 1817 God and the World we worship still together, Draw not our Laws to Him, but His to ours; Untrue to both, so prosperous in neither, The imperfect Will brings forth but barren Flowers!

Mankind that with his wit doth gild his heart Strong in his Passions, but in Goodnesse weake, Making great vices o're the lesse an Art, Breeds wonder, and mouves Ignorance to speake, Yet when his fame is to the highest borne, We know enough to laugh his praise to scorne. 3 Of Humane Learning Stanza CLX For onely that man understands indeed, And well remembers, which he well can doe, The Laws live, onely where the Law doth breed Obedience to the workes it bindes us to: And as the life of Wisedome hath exprest, If this ye know, then doe it, and be blest. Lord Brooke. SIR JOHN DAVIES 4 On the Immortality of the Soul (Sect. iv. Stanzas 12-14.) Doubtless, this could not be, but that she turns Bodies to spirits, by sublimation strange; As fire converts to fire the things it burns; As we our meats into our nature change. From their gross matter she abstracts the forms, And draws a kind of quintessence from things; Which to her proper nature she transforms, To bear them light, on her celestial wings. This doth she, when, from things particular, She doth abstract the universal kinds, Which bodiless and immaterial are, And can be only lodg'd within our minds. DONNE 5 Eclogue. ‘On Unworthy Wisdom’ So reclused Hermits oftentimes do know More of Heaven's glory than a worldly can: As Man is of the World, the Heart of Man Is an Epitome of God's great Book Of Creatures, and Men need no further look. 6 Letter to Sir Henry Goodyere Stanzas II, III, IV, and a few words from Stanza V, are prefixed as the motto to Essay XV of The Friend, 1818, i. 179; 1850, i. 136. For Stanza II, line 3— But he which dwells there is not so; for he With him who dwells there 'tis not so; for he For Stanza III— So had your body her morning, hath her noon, And shall not better, her next change is night: But her fair larger guest, t'whom sun and moon Are sparks, and short liv'd, claims another right.— The motto reads: Our bodies had their morning, have their noon, And shall not better—the next change is night, But their fair larger guest, t'whom sun and moon Are sparks and short liv'd, claims another right. BEN JONSON 7 Mutual Passion ALTERED AND MODERNIZED FROM AN OLD POET I love, and he loves me again, Yet dare I not tell who: For if the nymphs should know my swain, I fear they'd love him too. Yet while my joy's unknown, Its rosy buds are but half-blown: What no one with me shares, seems scarce my own. I'll tell, that if they be not glad, They yet may envy me: But then if I grow jealous mad, And of them pitied be, 'Twould vex me worse than scorn! And yet it cannot be forborn, Unless my heart would like my thoughts be torn. He is, if they can find him, fair And fresh, and fragrant too; As after rain the summer air, And looks as lilies do, That are this morning blown! Yet, yet I doubt, he is not known, Yet, yet I fear to have him fully shewn. But he hath eyes so large, and bright. Which none can see, and doubt That Love might thence his torches light Tho' Hate had put them out! But then to raise my fears, His voice—what maid so ever hears Will be my rival, tho' she have but ears. I'll tell no more! yet I love him, And he loves me; yet so, That never one low wish did dim Our love's pure light, I know— In each so free from blame, That both of us would gain new fame, If love's strong fears would let me tell his name! 8 The Hour-Glass O think, fair maid! these sands that pass In slender threads adown this glass, Were once the body of some swain, Who lov'd too well and lov'd in vain, And let one soft sigh heave thy breast, That not in life alone unblest E'en lovers' ashes find no rest. 9 The Poetaster. Act I, Scene 1. Let us not blame him: for against such chances The heartiest strife of manhood is scarce proof. We may read constancy and fortitude To other souls—but had ourselves been struck Even in the height and heat of our keen wishing, It might have made our heart-strings jar, like his. SAMUEL DANIEL 10 Epistle to Sir Thomas Egerton, Knight 5 Must there be still some discord mix'd among The harmony of men; whose mood accords Best with contention tun'd to notes of wrong? That when War fails, Peace must make war with words, With words unto destruction arm'd more strong Than ever were our foreign Foeman's swords; Making as deep, tho' not yet bleeding wounds? What War left scarless, Calumny confounds. 14 Truth lies entrapp'd where Cunning finds no bar: Since no proportion can there be betwixt Our actions, which in endless motion are, And ordinances, which are always fixt. Ten thousand Laws more cannot reach so far But Malice goes beyond, or lives commixt So close with Goodness, that, it ever will Corrupt, disguise, or counterfeit it still. 15 And therefore would our glorious Alfred, who Join'd with the King's the good man's Majesty, Not leave Law's labyrinth without a clue— Gave to deep skill its just authority,— But the last Judgement (this his Jury's plan)— Left to the natural sense of Work-day Man Adapted from an elder Poet. 11 Musophilus. Stanza cxlvii. Blind is that soul which from this truth can swerve No state stands sure, &amp;c. 12 Musophilus. Stanzas xxvii, xxix, xxx. O blessed letters, &amp;c. Since Writings are the Veins, the Arteries, And undecaying Life-strings of those Hearts, They still shall pant and still shall exercise Their mightiest powers when Nature none imparts: And the strong constitution of their Praise Wear out the infection of distemper'd days CHRISTOPHER HARVEY 13 The Synagogue THE NATIVITY OR CHRISTMAS DAY. Unfold thy face, unmask thy ray, Shine forth, bright sun, double the day; Let no malignant misty fume Nor foggy vapour, once presume To sheath or blunt one happy ray, That wins new splendour from the day,— This day that gives thee power to rise, And shine on hearts as well as eyes: This birth-day of all souls, when first On eyes of flesh and blood did burst That primal great lucific light, That rays to thee, to us gave sight. Which is both the circumference And centre of all excellence, &amp;c. [S.T.C.] MARK AKENSIDE 14 Blank Verse Inscriptions No. III. Whoe'er thou art whose path in Summer lies Through yonder village, turn thee where the Grove Of branching oaks a rural palace old Embosoms—there dwells Albert, generous lord Of all the harvest round. And onward thence A low plain chapel fronts the morning light Fast by a silent rivulet. Humbly walk, O stranger, o'er the consecrated ground; And on that verdant Hillock, which thou seest Beset with osiers, let thy pious hand Sprinkle fresh water from the brook, and strew Sweet-smelling flowers—for there doth Edmund rest, The learned shepherd; for each rural art Famed, and for songs harmonious, and the woes Of ill-requited love. The faithless pride Of fair Matilda sank him to the grave In manhood's prime. But soon did righteous Heaven With tears, with sharp remorse, and pining care Avenge her falsehood. Nor could all the gold And nuptial pomp, which lured her plighted faith From Edmund to a loftier husband's home, Relieve her breaking heart, or turn aside The strokes of death. Go, traveller, relate The mournful story. Haply some fair maid May hold it in remembrance, and be taught That riches cannot pay for truth or love. W. L. BOWLES 15 [—I yet remain] —I yet remain To mourn the hours of youth (yet mourn in vain) That fled neglected: wisely thou hast trod The better path—and that high meed which God Assign'd to virtue, tow'ring from the dust, Shall wait thy rising, Spirit pure and just! O God! how sweet it were to think, that all Who silent mourn around this gloomy ball Might hear the voice of joy;—but 'tis the will Of man's great Author, that thro' good and ill Calm he should hold his course, and so sustain His varied lot of pleasure, toil and pain! 1793. 16 NAPOLEON Then we may thank ourselves, Who spell-bound by the magic name of Peace Dream golden dreams. Go, warlike Britain, go, For the grey olive-branch change thy green laurels: Hang up thy rusty helmet, that the bee May have a hive, or spider find a loom! Instead of doubling drum and thrilling fife Be lull'd in lady's lap with amorous flutes: But for Napoleon, know, he'll scorn this calm: The ruddy planet at his birth bore sway, Sanguine adust his humour, and wild fire His ruling element. Rage, revenge, and cunning Make up the temper of this Captain's valour. Adapted from an old Play.</field>
