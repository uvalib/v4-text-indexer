      <field name="fulltext">VOL. ISquare brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. Sad patience that waiteth at the doore. —The Bee. Ceux qui ont été les prédécesseurs des grands esprits, et qui ont contribué en quelque facon à leur éducation, leur doivent d'être sauvés de l'oubli. Dante fait vivre Brunetto Latini, Milton du Bartas; Shakespeare fait vivre Lyly. —Mézières. SPEECHES AND VERSES AT THE TILT-YARD 1590–1600. A Sonet. At the Tilt-Yard; Nov. 17, 1590. His Golden lockes Time hath to Siluer turn'd, O Time too swift, ô Swiftnesse neuer ceasing! His Youth gainst Time and Age hath euer spurn'd, But spurn'd in vain, Youth waineth by increasing. Beauty, Str?gth, Youth, are flowers, but fading seen, Dutie, Faith, Loue, are roots, and euer greene. His Helmet now shall make a hiue for Bees, And Louers sonets turne to holy Psalmes: A man at Armes must now serue on his knees, And feede on praiers, which are Age his almes. But though from Court to Cottage he depart, His Saint is sure of his vnspotted heart. And when he saddest sits in homely Cell, Heele teach his swaines this Caroll for a Song,— Bless'd be the heartes that wish my Soueraigne well, Curs'd be the soules that thinke her any wrong! Goddess, allow this aged man his right, To be your Beads-man now, that was your Knight. Ode. Of Cynthia. At the Earl of Cumberland's Shew on Horseback; May 1, 1600. Th' ancient Readers of Heauens Booke, Which with curious eye did looke Into Natures story; All things vnder Cynthia tooke To bee transitory. This the learned only knew, But now all men finde it true, Cynthia is descended; With bright beames and heauenly hew, And lesser starres attended. Landes and Seas shee rules below, Where things change, and ebbe, and flowe, Spring, waxe olde, and perish; Only Time which all doth mowe, Her alone doth cherish. Times yong howres attend her still, And her Eyes and Cheekes do fill, With fresh youth and beautie: All her louers olde do grow, But their hartes, they do not so In their Loue and duty. This Song was sung before her sacred Maiestie at a shew on horsebacke, wherwith the right Honorable the Earle of Cumberland presented her Highnesse on Maie day last [1600]. ON THE QUEEN'S VISIT TO THEOBALDS, May, 1591. Written about the box. I was a giant's daughter of this isle, Turn'd to a mole by the Queen of Corn: My jewel I did bury by a wile, Again never from the earth to be torn, Till a virgin had reigned thirty-three years, Which shall be but the fourth part of her years. The Speeches and HONORABLE Entertainment giuen to the Queenes MAIESTIE in Progresse, at Cowdrey in Sussex, by the right Honorable the Lord Montacute. 1591. A Dittie. [Behold her lockes like wiers of beaten gold] Behold her lockes like wiers of beaten gold, her eies like starres that twinkle in the skie, Her heauenly face not framd of earthly molde, Her voice that sounds Apollos melodie, The miracle of time, the [whole] worlds storie, Fortunes Queen, Loues treasure, Natures glory. No flattering hope she likes, blind Fortunes bait nor shadowes of delight, fond fansies glasse, Nor charmes that do inchant, false artes deceit, nor fading ioyes, which time makes swiftly pas But chast desires which beateth all these downe; A Goddesse looke is worth a Monarchs crowne. Goddesse and Monarch of [t]his happie Ile, vouchsafe this bow which is an huntresse part: Your eies are arrows though they seeme to smile which neuer glanst but gald the stateliest hart, Strike one, strike all, for none at all can flie, They gaze you in the face although they die. The Dittie. [There is a bird that builds her neast with spice] There is a bird that builds her neast with spice, and built, the Sun to ashes doth her burne, Out of whose sinders doth another rise. &amp; she by scorching beames to dust doth turne: Thus life a death, and death a life doth proue, The rarest thing on earth except my loue. My loue that makes his neast with high desires, and is by beauties blaze to ashes brought, Out of the which do breake out greater fires, they quenched by disdain consume to nought, And out of nought my cleerest loue doth rise, True loue is often slaine but neuer dies. True loue which springs, though Fortune on it tread as camomel by pressing down doth grow Or as the Palme that higher reares his head, wh? men great burthens on the branches throw Loue fansies birth, Fidelitie the wombe, the Nurse Delight, Ingratitude the tombe. This Song of the Fisherman. The fish that seeks for food in siluer streame is vnawares beguiled with the hooke, And tender harts when lest of loue they dreame, do swallow beauties bait, a louely looke. The fish that shuns to bite, in net doth hit, The heart that scapes the eie is caught by wit. The thing cald Loue, poore Fisher men do feele rich pearles are found in hard and homely shels Our habits base, but hearts as true as steele, sad lookes, deep sighs, flat faith are all our spels, And when to vs our loues seeme faire to bee, We court them thus, Loue me and Ile loue thee. And if they saie our loue is fondly made, we neuer leaue till on their hearts we lite, Anglers haue patience by their proper trade, and are content to tarrie till they bite, Of all the fish that in the waters moue, We count them lumps that will not bite at loue. THE HONORABLE Entertainement gieuen to the Queenes Maiestie in Progresse, at Eluetham in Hampshire, by the right Honorable the Earle of Hertford. 1591 The Poets speech to his boy offering him a Cushion. Now let vs vse no cushions, but faire hearts: For now we kneel to more than usuall Saints. The Poets speech to her Maiestie. Whhile at the fountaine of the sacred hill, Vnder Apollos lute, I sweetly slept, Mongst prophets full possest with holy fury, And with true vertue, void of all disdaine: The Muses sung, and wak'd me with these wordes. Seest thou that English Nimph, in face and shape Resembling some great Goddesse, and whose beames Doe sprinkle heau'n with vnacquainted light, While shee doth visite Semers fraudlesse house, As Iupiter did honour with his presence The poore thatcht cottage, where Philæmon dwelt? See thou salute her with an humble voice; Phœbus, and we, will let thee lack no verses. But dare not once aspire to touch her praise, Who, like the Sunne for shew, to Gods for vertue, Fills all with Maiesty, and holy feare. More learned then our selues, shee ruleth vs: More rich then seas, shee doth commaund the seas: More fair then Nimphs, she gouerns al the Nimphs[:] More worthy then the Gods, shee wins the Gods. Behold (Augusta) thy poore suppliant Is here, at their desire, but thy desert. O sweete Elisa, grace me with a looke, Or from my browes this Laurell wreath will fall, And I vnhappy die amidst my song. Vnder my person Semer hides himselfe, His mouth yeelds pray'rs, his eie the Oliue branch; His praiers betoken duety, th'Oliue peace; His duety argues loue, his peace faire rest; His loue will smooth your minde, faire rest your body. This is your Semers heart and quality: To whom all things are ioyes, while thou art present, To whom nothing is pleasing, in thine absence. Behold, on thee how each thing sweetly smiles, To see thy brightnes glad our hemispheare: Night only enuies: whome faire stars doe crosse: All other creatures striue to shew their ioyes. The crooked-winding kid trips ore the lawnes; The milkewhite heafer wantons with the bull; The trees shew pleasure with their quiuiring leaues, The meddow with new grasse, the vine with grapes, The running brookes with sweet and siluer sound. Thee, thee (Sweet Princes), heau'n, &amp; earth, &amp; fluds, And plants, and beasts, salute with one accord: And while they gaze on thy perfections, Their eyes desire is neuer satisfied. Thy presence frees each thing, that liu'd in doubt: No seedes now feare the biting of the woorme; Nor deere the toyles; nor grasse the parching heat; Nor Birds the snare; nor corne the storme of haile. O Empresse, ô draw foorth these dayes to yeares, Yeeres to an age, ages to æternitie: That such as lately ioyed to see our sorrowes, May sorrow now, to see our perfect ioyes. Behold where all the Graces, vertues maydes, And lightfoote Howrs, the guardians of heau'ns gate, With ioyned forces doe remoue those blocks, Which Enuie layd in Maiesties highway. Come therefore, come vnder our humble roofe, And with a becke commaund what it containes: For all is thine: each part obeys thy will; Did not each part obey, the wholl should perish. Sing songs faire Nymphs, sing sweet triumphal songs, Fill wayes with flowrs, and th'ayr with harmony. The Dittie of the six Virgins Song. With fragrant flowers we strew the way And make this our chiefe holliday: For though this clime were blest of yore, Yet was it neuer proud before, O beauteous Queene of second Troy, Accept of our vnfained ioy. Now th'ayre is sweeter then sweet balme, And Satyrs daunce about the palme: Now earth, with verdure newly dight, Giues perfect signe of her delight. O beauteous Queene of second Troy, Accept of our vnfained ioy. Now birds record new harmonie, And trees doe whistle melodie: Now euerie thing that nature breeds, Doth clad it selfe in pleasant weeds. O beauteous Queene of second Troy, Accept of our vnfained ioy. The Oration of Nereus to her Maiesty. Faire Cinthia the wide Oceans Empresse, I watry Nereus houered on the coast To greete your Maiesty with this my traine Of dauncing Tritons, and shrill singing Nimphs. But all in vaine: Elisa was not there; For which our Neptune grieud, and blamd the star, Whose thwarting influence dasht our longing hope. Therefore impatient, that this worthles earth Should beare your Highnes weight, and we sea Gods, (Whose iealous waues haue swallowd vp your foes, And to your Realme are walles impregnable) With such large fauour seldome time are grac't: I from the deepes haue drawen this winding flud, Whose crescent forme figures the rich increase Of all that sweet Elisa holdeth deare. And with me came gould-brested India, Who daunted at your sight, leapt to the shoare, And sprinkling endlesse treasure on this Ile, Left me this iewell to present your Grace, For hym, that vnder you doth hold this place. See where her ship remaines, whose silkewouen takling Is turnde to twigs, and threefold mast to trees, Receiuing life from verdure of your lookes; (For what cannot your gracious looks effect?) Yon vgly monster creeping from the South, To spoyle these blessed fields of Albion, By selfe same beames is chang'd into a Snaile, Whose bulrush hornes are not of force to hurt. As this snaile is, so be thine enemies, And neuer yet did Nereus wishe in vaine. That Fort did Neptune raise, for your defence; And in this Barke, which gods hale neare the shore, White footed Thetis sends her Musicke maydes, To please Elisaes eares with harmony. Hear them fair Queene: and when their Musick ends, My Triton shall awake the Syluane Gods, To doe their hommage to your Maiesty. The Sea nymphes Dittie. How haps that now, when prime is don, An other spring time is begun? Our hemisphere is ouerrunne, With beauty of a second Sunne. Eccho. A second Sun. What second Sun hath raies so bright, To cause this vnacquainted light? Tis faire Elisaes matchlesse Grace, Who with her beames doth blesse the place Eccho. Doth blesse the place. The Oration of Syluanus. Syluanus comes from out the leauy groaues, To honor her, whom all the world adores, Faire Cinthia, whom no sooner Nature fram'd, And deckt with Fortunes, and with Vertues dower, But straight admiring what her skill had wrought, Shee broake the mould: that neuer Sunne might see The like to Albions Queene for excellence. Twas not the Tritons ayr-enforcing shell, As they perhaps would proudly make theyr vaunt, But those faire beames, that shoote from Maiesty, Which drew our eyes to wonder at thy worth. That worth breeds wonder; wonder holy feare; And holy feare vnfayned reuerence. Amongst the wanton dayes of goulden age Apollo playing in our pleasant shades, And printing oracles in euery leafe, Let fall this sacred scutchion from his brest, Wherein is writ, Detur dignissimæ. O therefore hold, what heauen hath made thy right, I but in duety yeeld desert her due. Nereus. But see Syluanus where thy loue doth sit. Syluanus. My sweet Neæra? was her eare so neare? O set my hearts delight vpon this banke, That in compassion of old sufferance, Shee may relent in sight of beauties Queene. Nereus. On this condition shall shee come on shoare. That with thy hand thou plight a solemne vow, Not to prophane her vndefiled state. Syluanus. Here, take my hand, and therewithall I vowe Nereus. That water will extinguish wanton fire. The Oration of faire Neæra. When Neptune late bestowed on me this barke, And sent by me this present to your Grace: Thus Nereus sung, who neuer sings but truth. Thine eyes (Neæra) shall in time behold A sea-borne Queene, worthy to gouerne Kings, On her depends the Fortune of thy boate, If shee but name it with a blisfull word. And view it with her life inspiring beames. Her beames yeeld gentle influence, like fayre starres, Her siluer sounding word is prophesie. Speake sacred Sybill, giue some prosperous name, That it may dare attempt a golden fleece, Or diue for pearles, and lay them in thy lap. For winde and waues, and all the worlde besides, Will make her way, whom thou shalt doome to blisse, For what is Sybils speech, but oracle? Here her Maiesty named the Pinnace, the Bonaduenture, and Neæra went on with her speech, as followeth. I now Neæraes barke is fortunate, And in thy seruice shall imploy her saile, And often make returne to thy auaile. O liue in endlesse ioy, with glorious fame, Sound Trumpets, sound, in honor of her name. The Plowmans Song. In the merrie moneth of May, In a morne, by breake of day, Forth I walked by the wood side, Where as May was in his pride. There I spied, all alone Phyllida and Corydon. Much adoe there was God wot, He would loue, and she would not. She said, neuer man was true: He said, none was false to you. He said, he had loued her long: She said, loue should haue no wrong. Coridon would kisse her then: She said, maides must kisse no men, Till they did for good and all. Then she made the shepheard call All the heauens to witnesse truth, Neuer lou'd a truer youth. Thus with many a pretie oath, Yea and nay, and faith and troth, Such as silly shepheards vse, When they will not loue abuse, Loue, which had beene long deluded, Was with kisses sweet concluded: And Phyllida with garlands gay, Was made the Lady of the May. The speech of the Fairy Queene to her Maiestie. I that abide in places vnder ground, Aureola, the Queene of Fairy land, That euery night in rings of painted flowers Turne round, and carroll out Elisaes name: Hearing, that Nereus and the Syluane Gods Haue lately welcomde your Imperiall Grace, Oapend the earth with this enchanting wand, To doe my duety to your Maiestie. And humbly to salute you with this Chaplet, Giuen me by Auberon the Fairy King. Bright shining Phœbe, that in humaine shape, Hid'st heauens perfection, vouchsafe t'accept it: And I Aureola, belou'd in heauen, (For amorous starres fall nightly in my lap) Will cause that heauens enlarge thy goulden dayes, And cut them short, that enuy at thy praise. [The Fairies Song.] Elisa is the fairest Queene That euer trod vpon this greene. Elisaes eyes are blessed starres, Inducing peace, subduing warres. Elisaes hand is christall bright, Her wordes are balme, her lookes are light. Elisaes brest is that faire hill, Where vertue dwels, and sacred skill, O blessed bee each day and houre, Where sweete Elisa builds her bowre. The Poets speech at her Maiesties departure. O see sweet Cynthia, how the watry gods, Which ioyd of late to view thy glorious beames, At this retire doe waile and wring their hands, Distilling from their eyes, salt showrs of teares, To bring in winter with their wet lament: For how can Sommer stay, when Sunne departs? See where Syluanus sits, and sadly mournes, To thinke that Autumn with his withered wings Will bring in tempest, when thy beames are hence: For how can sommer stay, when Sunne departs? See where those Graces, and those Howrs of heau'n Which at thy comming sung triumphall songs, And smoothd the way, and strewd it with sweet flowrs, Now, if they durst, would stop it with greene bowes, Least by thine absence the yeeres pride decay: For how can sommer stay, when Sunne departs? Leaves fal, grasse dies, beasts of the wood hang head, Birds cease to sing, and euerie creature wailes, To see the season alter with this change: For how can sommer stay, when Sunne departs? O, either stay, or soone returne againe, For sommers parting is the countries paine. [Come againe: A Dittie.] O come againe faire Natures treasure, Whose lookes yeeld ioyes exceeding measure. O come againe heau'ns chiefe delight, Thine absence makes eternall night, O come againe worlds starbright eye, Whose presence doth adorne the skie. O come againe sweet beauties Sunne: When thou art gone, our ioyes are done. FINIS. Speeches TO Queen Elizabeth AT Quarrendon: August, 1592. The Olde Knightes Tale. Now drowsie sleepe, death's image, ease's prolonger, Thow that hast kept my sences windowes closed, Dislodge these heauie humors, stay no longer, For light itself thie darkesom bandes haue losed, And of mine eies to better use disposed: To better use, for what can better be Then substance in the steede of shades to see. O mortall substance of immortall glorie! To whom all creatures ells are shaddowes demed; Vouchsafe an eare unto the woeful storie Of him who, whatso eare before he semed, Is nowe as you esteme to be estemed: And sence himself is of himself reporter To all your praise, will make his parte the shorter. Not far from hence, nor verie long agoe, The fayrie Queene the fayrest Queene saluted That euer lyued (&amp; euer may shee soe); What sportes and plaies, whose fame is largelie bruted, The place and persons were so fitlie shuted: For who a Prince can better entertaine Than can a Prince, or els a prince's vaine? Of all the pleasures there, among the rest, (The rest were justes and feates of Armed Knightes), Within hir bower she biddes her to a feast, Which with enchaunted pictures trim she dightes, And on them woordes of highe intention writes: For he that mightie states hath feasted, knowes Besides theire meate, they must be fedd with shewes. Manie there were that could no more but vewe them, Many that ouer curious nearer pride. Manie would conster needes that neuer knewe them, Som lookt, som lyked, som questioned, some eyed, One asked them too who should not be denied: But shee that thwarted, where she durst not strugle, To make her partie good was fayne to juggle. Forthwith the Tables were conveied hither, Such power she had by her infernall Arte; And I enjoyned to keepe them altogether, With speciall charge on them to sett my harte, Euer to tarrie, neuer to departe: Not bowing downe my face upon the grounde, Beholding still the Piller that was crounde. I whom in elder tyme she dearelie loued, Deare is that loue which nothing can disgrace, I that had ofte before her favor proued, But knewe not howe such fauoure to embrace, Yea, I am put in trust to warde this place: So kinde is loue, that being once conceauid, It trustes againe, although it were deceaued. Seruant, quoth shee, looke upward and beware Thou lend not anie Ladie once an eye; For diuers Ladies hither will repaire, Presuming that they can my charmes untie, Whose misse shall bring them to unconstancie: And happie art thou if thou haue such heede, As in anothers harme thine owne to reede. But loe unhappie I was ouertaken, By fortune forst, a stranger ladies thrall, Whom when I sawe, all former care forsaken, To finde her ought I lost meeself and all, Through which neglect of dutie 'gan my fall: It is the propertie of wrong consenting To ad unto the punishment lamenting. With this the just revengefull Fayrie Queene, As one that had conceaued Anger deepe, And therefore ment to execute her teene, Resolvde to caste mee in a deadlie sleepe, No other [sentence] coulde decorum keepe: For Justice sayth, that where the eie offended, Upon the eye the lawe should be extended. Thus haue I longe abode, without compassion, The rygor which that wrathefull Judge required; Till now a straung and suddaine alteration Declares the date of my distres expired: O peareles Prince! O presence most desired! By whose sole resolution this ys found, That none but Princes, Princes mindes expounde. In lue whereof, though far beneath your merrit, Accept this woorthles meede that longes thereto, It is your owne, and onlie you may weare it, The farry queene geue[s] euerie one his due, For she that punisht me rewardeth you; As for us heare, who nothing haue to paie, It is ynough for poore men if they pray. Cœlum? solum? beavit. Finis. The Songe after Dinner at the two Ladies entrance. To that Grace that sett us free, Ladies let us thankfull be; All enchaunted cares are ceast, Knightes restored, we releast; Eccho change thie mournefull song, Greefes to Groues and Caues belong; Of our new deliuerie, Eccho, Eccho, certifie. Farwell all in woods that dwell, Farwell satyres, nymphes farewell; Adew desires, fancies die, Farwell all inconstancie. Nowe thrice welcome to this place, Heauenlie Goddesse! prince of grace! She hath freed us carefull wightes, Captiue Ladies, Captiue Knightes. To that Grace that sett us free, Ladies let us thankfull bee. Finis. The last Songe. Happie houre, happie daie, That Eliza came this waie! Greate in honor, great in place, Greater yet in geving grace, Greate in wisdome, great in minde, But in bothe aboue her kinde, Greate in vertue, greate in name, Yet in power beyond her fame. Happie houre, happie daie, That Eliza came this waie! She, with more than graces grace, Hath made proude this humble place, She, with more than wisdomes head, Hath enchaunted tables read, She, with more than vertues mighte, Hath restorid us to right. Happie houre, happie daie, That Eliza came this waie! Heauie harted Knightes are eased, And light harted Ladies pleased, Constant nowe they vowe to be, Hating all inconstancie. Constant Piller, constant Crowne, Is the aged Knightes renowne. Happie houre, happie daie, That Eliza came this waie! Finis. To the most renowned Queene, Owner of the best Crowne, &amp; crowned with the best desertes, the lyuing Loue of dying Loricus. I Loricus, Bodie sicke, Sences sounde, Remembraunce quicke, Neuer crauing, euer seruing, Little hauing, lesse deseruing, Though a hartie true wellwiller Of the Crowne &amp; crowned Piller, To that Crowne, my lyues content, Make my Will &amp; Testament. Soule! goe first to heauenlie rest; Soule the Bodies heauenlie gueste, Where, both Host &amp; Inn decaying, Yeld the gueste no quiet staying. Bodie! back againe, departe; Earth thou wast, &amp; Earth thou arte. Mortall creatures still be jurneing, From the earth to earth returning. As for anie worldlie lyuing Nothing haue I woorth the geeuing: Let the baser indeed take them, We which follow God forsake them. But if anie wishe to dwell, As I did, in homely Cell, Let him pull his Castells downe, And as I did serue the Crowne. Serue the Crowne, O Crowne deseruing, Better than Loricus seruing. In witness whereof I haue set to my hande &amp; harte, LORICUS, Columnæ coronatæ Custos fidelissimus. In presence of us whose names are underwritten, Stellatus, Rectoriæ Coronatæ Capellanus. Renatus, Equitus Coronati Servus obseruantissimus. SPEECHES DELIVERED TO HER MAIESTIE THIS LAST PROGRESSE, AT THE Right Honorable the Lady Rvssels, at Bissam, the Right Honorable the Lorde Chandos, at Sudley, at the Right Honorable the Lord Norris, at Ricorte. [Swel Ceres now, for other Gods are shrinking] At the bottome of the hill, entring into the hous Ceres with her Nymphes in an haruest Cart, meete her Maiesty, hauing a Crowne of wheat-ears with a Iewell, and after this song, vttered the speech following. Swel Ceres now, for other Gods are shrinking, Pomona pineth, Fruitlesse her tree; Faire Phœbus shineth Onely on mee. Conceite doth make me smile whilst I am thinking, How euery one doth read my story, How euery bough on Ceres lowreth, Cause heauens plenty on me powreth, And they in leaues doe onely glory, All other Gods of power bereuen, Ceres only Queene of heauen. With Robes and flowers let me be dressed, Cynthia that shineth, Is not so cleare, Cynthia declineth, When I appeere, Yet in this Ile shee raignes as blessed, And euery one at her doth wonder, And in my eares still fonde Fame whispers, Cynthia shalbe Ceres Mistres, But first my Carre shall riue a sunder, [The cart parts in the middle.] Helpe Phœbus helpe! my fall is suddaine; Cynthia, Cynthia, must be soueraigne. [Sing you, plaie you, but sing and play my truth] Sing you, plaie you, but sing and play my truth, This tree my Lute, these sighes my notes of ruth: The Lawrell leafe for euer shall bee greene, And chastety shalbe Apolloes Queene. If gods maye dye, here shall my tombe be plaste, And this engrauen, ‘Fonde Phœbus, Daphne chaste.’ [The Song.] [My hart and tongue were twinnes, at once conceaued] My hart and tongue were twinnes, at once conceaued; The eldest was my hart, borne dumbe by destenie, The last my tongue, of all sweete thoughts bereaued, Yet strung and tunde, to play harts harmonie. Both knit in one, and yet asunder placed, What hart would speake, the tongue doeth still discouer; What tongue doth speake, is of the hart embraced, And both are one to make a new found louer: New founde, and onely founde in Gods and Kings, Whose words are deedes, but deedes nor words regarded: Chaste thoughts doe mount, and she with swiftest wings, My loue with paine, my paine with losse rewarded: Engraue vpon this tree, Daphnes perfection, That neither men nor gods, can force affection. [Nimpha mane, per me concordant carmina neruis.] The song ended, the tree riued, and Daphne issued out, Apollo ranne after, with these words. Nimpha mane, per me concordant carmina neruis. Faire Daphne staye, too chaste because too faire, Yet fairer in mine eies, because so chaste, And yet because so chaste, must I despaire? And to despaire, I yeelded haue at last. Shepheard possesse thy loue, for me too cruell, Possesse thy loue, thou knowest not how to measure, A dunghill cock doeth often find a Iewell, Enioying that, he knowes not to be treasure. When broomy bearde, to sweepe thy lips presume, When on thy necke, his rough hewen armes shall moue, And gloate on thee with eies that drizell reume, When that his toothlesse mouth shall call thee loue, Noght will I saie of him, but pittie thee, That beauty might, but would no wiser bee. The verses, written in the tables which were giuen to her Maiesty Let fame describe your rare perfection, Let nature paint your beauties glory, Let loue engraue your true affection, Let wonder write your vertues story, By them and Gods must you be blazed, Sufficeth men they stand amazed. The Song. [Hearbes, wordes, and stones, all maladies haue cured] Hearbes, wordes, and stones, all maladies haue cured, Hearbes, wordes, and stones, I vsed when I loued. Hearbes smels, words, winde, stones hardnes haue procured; By stones, nor wordes, nor hearbes her minde was moued. I askt the cause: this was a womans reason, Mongst hearbes are weedes, and thereby are refused; Deceite, as well as truth, speakes wordes in season, False stones by foiles haue many one abused. I sight, and then shee saide my fancie smoaked; I gaz'd, shee saide my lookes were follies glauncing; I sounded deade, shee saide my loue was choaked; I started vp, shee saide my thoughtes were dauncing. O, sacred loue! if thou haue any Godhead, Teach other rules to winne a maidenheade. [FINIS.] ENTERTAINMENT AT HAREFIELD. July–August, 1602. The humble Petition of a guiltlesse Lady, delivered in writing vpon Munday Morninge, when the [robe] of rainbowes was presented to the Q. by the La. Walsingham. Beauties rose, and Vertues booke, Angells minde, and Angells looke, To all Saints and Angells deare, Clearest Maiestie on earth, Heauen did smile at your faire birth, And since your daies have been most cleare. Only poore St. Swythen now Doth heare you blame his cloudy brow: But that poore St. deuoutly sweares, It is but a tradition vaine That his much weeping causeth raine For S?? in heauen shedd no teares: But this he saith, that to his feast Commeth Iris, an unbidden guest, In her moist roabe of collers gay; And she cometh, she ever staies, For the space of fortie daies, And more or lesse raines euery day. But the good S?, when once he knew, This raine was like to fall on you, If S?? could weepe, he had wept as much As when he did the Lady leade That did on burning iron tread, To Ladies his respect is such. He gently first bids Iris goe Unto the Antipodes below, But shee for that more sullen grew. When he saw that, with angry looke, From her her rayneie roabes he tooke, Which heere he doth present to you. It is fitt it should with you remaine, For you know better how to raine. Yet if it raine still as before, S? Swythen praies that you would guesse, That Iris doth more roabes possesse, And that you should blame him no more. The Complaint of the Satyres against the Nymphes. Tell me, O Nymphes, why do you Shune vs that your loues pursue? What doe the Satyres notes retaine That should merite your disdaine? On our browes if hornes doe growe, Was not Bacchus armed soe? Yet of him the Candean maid Held no scorne, nor was affraid. Say our colours tawny bee, Phœbus was not faire to see: Yet faire Clymen did not shunn To bee Mother of his Sonne. If our beards be rough and long, Soe had Hercules the strong: Yet Deianier, with many a kisse, Joyn'd her tender lipps to his. If our bodies hayry bee, Mars as rugged was as wee: Yet did Ilia think her grac'd, For to be by Mars imbrac'd. Say our feet ill-fauored are, Cripples leggs are worse by farre: Yet faire Venus, during life, Was the lymping Vulcan's wife. Breefly, if by nature we But imperfect creatures be; Thinke not our defects so much, Since Celestial Powers be such. But you Nymphes, whose venal loue Loue of gold alone doth moue, Though you scorne vs, yet for gold Your base loue is bought and sold. Finis. A Lottery presented before the late Queenes Maiestie at the Lord Chancellors house. 1602. A Marriner with a box vnder his arme, containing all the seuerall things following, supposed to come from the Carricke, came into the Presence singing this Song. Cynthia Queene of Seas and lands, That fortune euery where commands, Sent forth Fortune to the Sea, To try her fortune euery way. There did I fortune meet, which makes me now to sing, There is no fishing to the Sea, nor seruice to the King. All the Nymphes of Thetis traine, Did Cynthiaes fortune entertaine: Many a iewell, many a iem, Was to her fortune brought by them. Her fortune sped so well, as makes me now to sing, There is no fishing to the Sea, nor seruice to the King. Fortune, that it might be seene That she did serue a royall Queene, A franke and royall hand did beare, And cast her fauors euery where. Some toies fel to my share, which makes me now to sing, There is no fishing to the Sea, nor seruice to the King. And the Song ended, he vttered this short speech. God saue you faire Ladies all: and for my part, if euer I be brought to answere my sinnes, God forgiue me my sharking, and lay vsurie to my charge. I am a Marriner, and am now come from the sea, where I had the fortune to light vpon these few trifles. I must confesse I came but lightly by them, but I no sooner had them, but I made a vow that as they came to my hands by fortune, so I would not part with them but by fortune. To that end I haue euer since carried these Lots about me, that if I met with fit company I might deuide my booty among them. And now (I thanke my good fortune) I am lighted into the best company of the world, a company of the fairest Ladies that euer I saw. Come Ladies trie your fortunes, and if any light vpon an vnfortunate blanke, let her thinke that fortune doth but mocke her in these trifles, and meanes to pleasure her in greater matters.

If euerie Ioy now had a tongue, And all the seuerall thoughts were sung, Vnder this happie roofe, They could make proofe, How much they doe reioyce, In one, the Maisters voice: and that is welcome still. Hayle double flame of Maiesties, Whose luster quicken's: blindes not eyes, Who euer saw such light would wish for night? Stay, stay, we may reioyce, And keepe our constant voice, which is your welcome still. When two Sunnes shine, the ample day Should not so haste it selfe away: A feare to loose destroyes almost our Ioyes, But we must so reioyce, As we make good our voice, of welcome, welcome still. Chorus. And would you euer stay, And make it lasting day, Tis welcome, welcome still. [Sweet Ioe vouchsafe once to impart] Shepheard: Sweet Ioe vouchsafe once to impart, did euer liue so coy a lasse, that vnto loue was neuer moued? Shephardesse: Yes Shephard She that has the hart, and is resolud her life to passe: neither to loue or be beloued. He: She sencelesse liues, without affection. She: Yet happie liues, without subiection. He: To be pluckt are Roses blowne, To be mowed are meddowes growne: Iemmes are made but to be showne, And woman's best— She: To holde her owne. Epicedium. A FVNERAL Oration, vpon the death of the late deceased Princesse of famous memorye, Elizabeth by the grace of God, Queen of England, France and Ireland. A true Subiects sorowe, for the losse of his late Soueraigne. I ioyne not handes with sorowe for a while, To soothe the time, or please the hungrie eares: Nor do inforce my mercinarie stile, No feigned liuerye my Inuention weares. Nor do I ground my fabulous discourse On what before hath vsually bene seene: My greife doth flowe from a more plentious source, From her that dy'd a virgin and a Queene. You Cristall Nimphes that haunt the banks of Thames, Tune your sad Timbrils in this wofull day: And force the swift windes and the sliding streames To stand a while and listen to your Lay. Your fading Temples bound about with yewe, At euery step your hands deuoutly wring, Let one notes fall anothers height renewe, And with compassion your sad Nænia sing. Graces and Muses waite vpon her Hearse: Three are the first, the last the sacred Nine: The sad'st of which, in a blacke tragique verse, Shall sing the Requiem passing to her shrine. An Ebon Charriot to support the Beere, Drawne with the blacke steedes of the gloomy night: Stooping their stiffe Crests, with a heauie cheere, Stirring compassion in the peoples sight. The Pyle prepard where on her body lyes, In Cipresse shadowes sit you downe forlorne: Whose bowes be dew'd with plenty of your eyes, (For her with griefe) the Branches shall adorne. Let fall your eye-lids like the Sunnes cleere set, When your pale hands put to the vestall flame: And from your brests, your sorowes freely let, Crying one Beta and Elizas name. Vpon the Alter, place your Virgin spoyles, And one by one with comelinesse bestowe: Dianaes buskins and her hunting toyles, Her empty quiuer and her stringles bowe. Let euery Virgin offer vp a teare, The richest Incence nature can alowe: And at her tombe (for euer yeare by yeare) Pay the oblation of a mayden vowe. And the tru'st vestall the most sacred liuer, That euer harbored an vnspotted spirit, Retaine thy vertues, and thy name for euer, To tell the world thy beautie and thy merrit. Wher's Collin Clout, or Rowland now become, That wont to leade our Shepheards in a ring? (Ah me) the first, pale death hath strooken dombe, The latter, none incourageth to sing. But I vnskilfull, a poore Shepheards Lad, That the hye knowledge onely doe adore: Would offer more, if I more plenty had, But comming short, of their aboundant store, A willing heart that on thy fame could dwell, Thus bids Eliza happily farewell.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III Sad patience that waiteth at the doore. —The Bee. Ceux qui ont été les prédécesseurs des grands esprits, et qui ont contribué en quelque facon à leur éducation, leur doivent d'être sauvés de l'oubli. Dante fait vivre Brunetto Latini, Milton du Bartas; Shakespeare fait vivre Lyly. —Mézières. A Whip for an Ape:The attribution of this poem is questionable. Or Martin displaied. Ordo Sacerdotum fatuo turbatur ab omni, Labitur &amp; passim Religionis honos. Since reason (Martin) cannot stay thy pen, We'il see what rime will doo: haue at thee then. A dizard late skipt out vpon our Stage; But in a sacke, that no man might him sée: And though we knowe not yet the paltrie page, Himselfe hath Martin made his name to bée. A proper name, and for his feates most fit; The only thing wherein he hath shew'd wit. Who knoweth not, that Apes men Martins call; Which beast this baggage seemes as t'were himselfe: So as both nature, nurture, name and all, Of that's expressed in this apish elfe. Which Ile make good to Martin Marr-als face In thrée plaine poynts, and will not bate an ace. For first the Ape delights with moppes and mowes, And mocketh Prince and peasants all alike: This iesting Jacke that no good manner knowes, With his Asse héeles presumes all States to strike. Whose scoffes so stinking in each nose doth smell, As all mouthes saie of dolts he beares the bell. Sometimes his choppes doo walke in poynts too hie, Wherein the Ape himselfe a Woodcocke tries: Sometimes with floutes he drawes his mouth awrie, And sweares by his ten bones, and falselie lies. Wherefore be what he will I do not passe, He is the paltriest Ape that euer was. Such fléering, léering, iarring fooles bopéepe; Such hahaes, téehées, wéehées, wild colts play: Such sohoes, whoopes and hallowes, hold and kéepe; Such rangings, ragings, reuelings, roysters ray, With so foule mouth, and knaue at euery catch, Tis some knaues neast did surely Martin hatch. Now out he runnes with Cuckowe king of May, Then in he leapes with a wild Morrice daunce; Now strikes he vp Dame Lawsens lustie lay; Then comes Sir Ieffries ale tub tapde by chaunce: Which makes me gesse, (and I can shrewdly smell) He loues both t'one and t'other passing well. Then straight as though he were distracted quite, He chafeth like a cutpurse layd in Warde; And rudely railes with all his maine and might, Against both Knights and Lords without regarde: So as Bridewell must tame his dronken fits, And Bedlem helpe to bring him to his wits. But Martin, why in matters of such waight Doest thou thus play the Dawe and dancing foole? O sir (quoth he) this is a pleasant baite For men of sorts, to traine them to my schoole. Ye noble States how can you like hereof, A shamelesse Ape at your sage heads should scoffe? Good Noddie now leaue scribling in such matters, They are no tooles for fooles to tend vnto; Wise men regard not what mad Monckies patters; Twere trim a beast should teach men what to do. Now Tarleton's dead the Consort lackes a vice: For knaue and foole thou maist beare pricke and price. The sacred sect and perfect pure precise, Whose cause must be by Scoggins iests maintainde, Ye shewe although that purple Apes disguise, Yet Apes [ye] are still, and so must be disdainde. For though your Lyons lookes weake eyes escapes Your babling bookes bewraies you all for Apes. The next poynt is, Apes vse to tosse and teare What once their fidling fingers fasten on; And clime aloft and cast downe euery where, And neuer staies till all that stands be gon. Now whether this in Martin be not true, You wiser heads marke here what doth ensue. What is it not that Martin doth not rent? Cappes, Tippets, Gownes, blacke Chiuers, Rotchets white; Communion bookes, and Homelies, yea so bent To teare, as womens wimples feele his spite. Thus tearing all, as all Apes vse to doo; He teares withall the Church of Christ in two. Marke now what things he meanes to tumble downe, For to this poynt to looke is worth the while, In one that makes no choyce twixt Cap and Crowne; Cathedrall Churches he would faine vntile, And snatch vp Bishops lands, and catch away All gaine of learning for his prouling pray. And thinke you not he will pull downe at length Aswell the top from tower, as Cocke from stéeple? And when his head hath gotten some more strength, To play with Prince as now he doth with people? Yes, he that now saith, Why should Bishops bée? Will next crie out, Why Kings? The Saincts are frée. The Germaine Boores with Clergie men began, But neuer left till Prince and Péeres were dead: Iacke Leydon was a holie zealous man, But ceast not till the Crowne was on his head. And Martins mate Iacke Strawe would alwaies ring The Clergies faults, but sought to kill the King. Oh that quoth Martin chwere a Noble man! A vaunt vile villaine: tis not for such swads. And of the Counsell too; Marke Princes then: These roomes are raught at by these lustie lads. For Apes must climbe, and neuer stay their wit, Untill on top of highest hilles they sit. What meane they els, in euery towne to craue Their Priest and King like Christ himselfe to be? And for one Pope ten thousand Popes to haue, And to controll the highest he or she? Aske Scotland that, whose King so long they crost As he was like his Kingdome to haue lost. Beware ye States and Nobles of this land, The Clergie is but one of these mens buts: The Ape at last on masters necke will stand: Then gegge betime these gaping greedie guts, Least that too soone, and then too late ye feele, He strikes at head that first began with heele. The third tricke is, what Apes by flattering waies Cannot come by, with biting they will snatch: Our Martin makes no bones, but plainlie saies, Their fists shall walke, they will both bite and scratch. He'il make their hearts to ake, and will not faile, Where pen cannot, their penknife shall preuaile. But this is false, he saith he did but mocke: A foole he was that so his words did scan. He only ment with pen their pates to knocke: A knaue he is, that so turnes cat in pan. But Martin sweare and stare as déepe as hell, Thy sprite thy spite and mischeuous mind doth tell. The thing that neither Pope with Booke nor Bull, Nor Spanish King with ships could do without, Our Martins here at home will worke at full; If Prince curbe not betimes that rabble rout. That is, destroy both Church, and State, and all; For if t'one faile, the other néedes must fall. Thou England then whom God doth make so glad, Through Gospels grace and Princes prudent raigne: Take heede least thou at last be made as sad, Through Martins makebates marring, to thy paine: For he marres all, and maketh nought, nor will, Saue lyes and strife, and workes for Englands ill. And ye graue men that answere Martins mowes, He mockes the more, and you in vaine loose times: Leaue Apes to dogges to baite, their skins to crowes, And let old Lanam lash him with his rimes. The beast is proud when men wey his enditings: Let his worke go the waie of all wast writings. Now Martin, you that say you will spawne out Your broyling brattes in euery towne to dwell; Wée will prouide in each place for your route A bell and whippe, that Apes do loue so well. And if ye skippe and will not wey the checke, We'il haue a springe and catch you by the necke. And so adiew mad Martin marre the land, Leaue off thy worke, and more worke, hear'st thou me? Thy work's nought worth, take better worke in hand: Thou marr'st thy worke, &amp; thy worke will marre thée. Worke not a newe, least it doth worke thy wracke, And thou make worke for him that worke doth lacke. And this I warne thée Martins Monckies face, Take héed of me, my rime doth charme thee bad: I am a rimer of the Irish race, And haue alreadie rimde thée staring mad. But if thou ceasest not thy bald iests still to spread, Ile neuer leaue, till I haue rimde thée dead. FINIS. MAR-MARTINEThe attribution of this poem is questionable. Missing sections are not attributed to Lyly. I know not why a trueth in rime set out Maie not as wel mar Martine and his mates, As shamelesse lies in prose-books cast about Marpriests, &amp; prelates, and subvert whole states. For where truth builds, and lying overthroes, One truth in rime, is worth ten lies in prose. [1] L[ordes] of our land, and makers of our Lawes, Long may yee liue, Lawes many may you make, This careful, kind, and country-louing clawse, As from a faithfull friend, vouchsafe to take: Martine the merry, who now is Mar-prelate, Will proue madde Martine, and Martine mar-the-state. The wind doth first send forth a whistling sound, Then fierce, and fearefull, hollow, thundering threates, At length it riues the earth and rents the ground And tumbles townes and citties from their seates, So he who first did laughing libells send, Will at the last procure a wreakefull end. Women are woed to follow men precise Young boies without experience hold th? Gods, Yea some for gaine, who are both olde and wise: Thus merrie Martine sets the world at ods. The frozen snake for colde that cannot creepe Restorde to strength a stinging stur will keepe. Let neighbour-nations learne vs to beware, Let harmes at home teach vs for to take heede; When Browne and Barrowe haue done what they dare, Their hellish Hidraes heades will spring with speede: Such men as Martine caused all these woes: This poison still encreaseth as it goes. Somewhat I hearde, and mickle haue I seene It were too long to tell your Lordships what: Somewhat I knowe, and somewhat haue I beene, Yet this I saie, and this is also flat. Bridle the coltish mouth of Male-part Or else his hoofe will hurte both head and hart. Anglia Martinis parce favere malis. [4] O England gemme of Europe, Angells land, Blest for thy gospell, people, prince, and all, And all through peace, let Martins vnderstand The hony of thy peace, abhorre their gall. Martins? what kind of creatures mought those bee? Birds, beasts, men, Angels, Feends? Nay worse say we. The feendes spake faire sometimes and honor gaue, Curse and contempt is all that Martins haue. England if yet thou art to learne thy spell, Learne other things, such doctrine is for hell. What favor would these Martins? Shall I say As other birds wherwith yong children play. Let them be cagd, and hempseed be their food Hempseed the only meate to feede this broode. Disclaime these monsters, take them not for thine Hell was their wombe, and hell must be their shryne. [5] Many would know the holy Asse, And who mought Martin been, Plucke but the footecloth from his backe, The Asse will soone be seene. [6] My Lordes wise wittall Martins thinke, Your Lordships flie to hie: Keepe on your flight aloft as yet, Lest Martins come too nie. For were your winges a little clipt, They soone would plucke the rest: And then the place too high for you. Would be pure Martins nest. [11] Wel maist thou marke but neuer canst thou marre, This present state whereat thou so doost storme: Nor they that thee vphold to make this iarre, And would forsooth our English lawes deforme. Then be thou but Marke-prelate as thou art: Thou canst not marre though thou wouldst swelt thy hart. [12] In Ammons land pretended Rephaims dwelt, That termd them-selues Reformers of the state, These like Zanzummins, and Deformers dealte, Among the people stirring vp debate. But when their vilenes, was espied and knowen: From Ammons land this Gyants broode, was throwen. Our England, that for vnitie hath beene, A glasse for Europe, hath such monsters bread, That raile at Prelats, and oppugne their Queene, Whole common wealthes, each beareth in his head. These Rephaims, for so the[y] would be deemd: Are nothing lesse, then that they most haue seemd. Then if we loue the gouernement of peace, Which true Reformers from aboue maintaine, And forraine force could never make it cease, Nor these Deformers, can with vices staine: First let vs finde pretended Rephaims rowte, And like Zanzummins, let vs cast them out. [13] Martin had much a farther reach, then euery man can gesse, Hee might haue cald himselfe Mar-preest, that hath bene somewhat lesse, But seeking all to overthrowe, what ever high might be: Mar-prelate he did call himselfe, a foe to high degree. [15] If any mervaile at the man, and doe desire to see The stile and phrase of Martins booke: come learne it here of mee. Holde my cloke boy, chill haue a vling at Martin, O the boore; And if his horseplay like him well, of such he shall haue store. He thus bumfeges his bousing mates, and who is Martins mate? O that the steale-counters were knoune, chood catch them by the pate. Th'vnsauorie snuffes first iesting booke, though clownish, knauish was: But keeping still one stile, he prooues a sodden headed asse. Beare with his ingramnesse a while, his seasoned wainscot face: That brought that godly Cobler Cliffe, for to disproue his grace. But (O) that Godly cobler Cliffe, as honest an olde lad, As Martin (O the libeller) of hangbyes ever had. If I berime thy worshipnes, as thou beliest thy betters: For railing, see which of vs two shall be the greatest getters. But if in flinging at such states, thy noddle be no slower: Thy brother hangman will thee make, be pulde three asses lower. Then mend these manners Martin, or in spite of Martins nose: My rithme shall be as dogrell, as vnlearned is thy prose. These tinkers termes, and barbers iestes first Tarleton on the stage, Then Martin in his bookes of lies, hath put in euery page: The common sort of simple swads, I can their state but pitie: That will vouchsafe, or deygne to laugh, at libelles so vnwittie. Let Martin thinke some pen as badde, some head to be as knavish: Soome tongue to be as glibbe as his, some rayling all as lavish, And be content: if not, because we know not where to finde thee: We hope to se thee where deserts of treason haue assigned thee. [16] Cast of thy cloake and shriue thy selfe, in cloake-bagge, as is meete: And leaue thy flinging at the preest, as Iades doe with their feete. The Preest must liue, the Bishop guide: To teach thee how to leaue thy pride. [17] If Martin dy by hangmans hands, as he deserues no lesse, This Epitaph must be engravde, his maners to expresse. Here hangs knaue Martine a traitrous Libeler he was Enemie pretended but in hart a friend to the Papa, Now made meat to the birdes that about his carkas are hagling. Learne by his example yee route of Pruritan Asses, Not to resist the doings of our most gratious Hester, Martin is hangd [f]or the Master of al Hypocritical hangbies.</field>

THE TRIVMPHS OF TROPHES, In Saphic verse of Iubiles. If DAVID daunst for ioy before the Arke being a king If Barac sang when Israels foes were foild, Then victors wee that Deboras song may sing Our Iudith stout Holofernes Mates hath spoild. If Rome of Romane Triumphes earst was oft so glad and likewise Greece of Grecians Trophes ioyed: If Iewes of Iubilees their onlie mirth haue had then England leap, and laugh aloud for Queene enioyd. Now Baal and Bell, now Titanes sonnes are slaine, their Prophets false their wicked Priests are kild Their Pluto howles that Babels brood are taen, their Tower did fall that Nimrods Imps did build. Sith Nessus brood and Cassius crue are knowen like Siluane Centaures conspirde your Realme to quaile, Take courage Queene, for Sinon sleights abroad are blowen, the Traitours found, and yet the treasons faile. These Cicloppes seede which at your crowne doe kicke and frame a forme to make your kingdome bleed, Like Giants seeke with stones the starres to strike but mist the marke and wound themselues in deed: They vowd Zopirus vowes, to please Darius beck they sought a new deuise which Sphinx of Rome th? taught, They faine would finde, that England had one neck, that by a stroke the head might off they sought— Their match was made, their wager was not wonne, their snares were laid, but yet their purpose mist, Their day decreed, and yet the deed not done, a will they had you see, that wanted what they wis[h]t. What thought Pyragmons sprats to doe, we know, their Romish Iesabell Naboths vineyard sought, Who like Medusa bends her cursed Bow the onlie Circes, which hath this mischief wrought. These vipers tend with Briareus hundred hands, with hundred Argus eies these Scorpions wait, These busie Basilisks and brood of Cocatrice stands like Nilus Crocodiles hungrie for their bait. These sucking serpents, these monstrous snakish crewe, these blooddie Dragons like spiteful Asps are set, With Hidras heads which erst Alcides slue are now of late with our Bellona mette. Of Canaan faine they would a Chaos make, and bring Palladium in, our Ilion to deface, A spoile for Hispaine, a feat for Fraunce in hand they take and quite to make an end of Brutus race. Thus these climing mates Enceladus like attempt, in armes seeke Ioue from skies by force to take, They seeke the Sun, the Moone, the Starres in great contempt to obscure their light a deadlie Eclips to make. They seeke with Phaæton Phoebus charge to rest, Vulcans net, Gordian knot they would vnknit And breake their blooddie blades on Pallas breast, thus they couet much in Moses chaire to sit. To wrest from Hercules hand his Club, who can? who may from Ioue, his lightning take by force? Homers verse, who can disgrace? I say no man, who then can touch a sacred Princes coarse. Though Cæsar was in Senate slaine by Brute his friend, Though Cirus head was bathd in blood luke warme, No maruaile though, for blood requireth blood at thend but mercie too much thine, I feare doth harme, For if Laban was for Iacob sake so blest, and Putiphars hap, by Iosephs meane no lesse Our hap, our blisse, our ioyes wherein we rest, For whom it is, we must of force confesse. Who with Ionas gourd hath sau'de vs from the Sunne, Who with Aser shoes, hath kept vs from the mire? Who hath with Dauids sling Golias mates vndone. our Cynthia, she who hath appeas'd Iehouas ire. These on Bellerephons horse do ride in skie, with Icarus wings to clime in cloudes is their drift, These would make Architas woodden Doue to flie, What blinde Tiresias doth not see their shift. In Phætonissa schoole, at Endor they were taught, with Dracos ink to write, with Creons seale to signe, With Iudas kisse to kill, with Hamons haue they sought, both Iudaes spoyle, and Sions fall in fine. These secret Satires, these cruell Catelins wait, these dogs of Moabs house greadie of their pray. Like Eumenides whelpes tending on their bait, Vultures for Prometheus guts readie set in ray. They ventured Acherontas depth to wade, they striued through Stigias streame to saile, Mauger of Megeras head away they made, by Carons help, Elisius field to assaile. To make spotted Ewes with Iacobs stick they sought, to walke vnseene, with Giges ring faine they would Of Simon Magus these men would faine be taught, like Curres by Circes charm'd to be with Lions bold. Circes cup is falne, Calipsos sauce is shed Balims brood is bar[e]d, their Harpies are descried, Cerberus soppes are found, Sirens songs are red Thus is Accaron knowen, and Romane Idoll tried. Their drinke is blood, their bread is humane flesh, Consuls heads with Preachers tongues their food, &amp; what Is their daintiest dish? Princes harts I gesse, Thus like Basan Bulles, they feed their Pope with fat. But time decreed, how long should Assur liue, and God foretolde, when Pharaoes life should end, To take thy life the man of sinne doth striue, in vaine O Queene, when Angels thee defend. Could Ionas in the raging Seas be drownd? could Lions Daniel in their Dennes deuoure? Might Misael burne in firie furnace bound? durst Traitours blade attempt our sacred Princes bowre? A blast of winde made Th'assirians hoast to flie, Earthen pots made Madianites to take their flight, Hornes threw Ierichoes wall flat on ground to be, God makes Flies, Frogs, Rats and Lice, for him to fight. Cains curse, Herods death, I wish on them to fall, that seeke a sacred Prince with secret sword to kill, Iudas death to good for Iudas mates I call, who bathes in blood, and drinke of blood their fill. But Serpents neuer build in Boxe, nor breede in Cipres tree, no Canker can the Emerald touch, Euen so these hellish Heliottes cannot feed, on her whose vertues rare amaseth such. These Minotaurus brood from Rome, from Creete, with sword and fire, in Albion swarme like Bees Like Sampsons Foxes with fired tailes and feete, they dread no death to winne a Popish fees. In Rhodes was neuer seen, they say, an Eagles nest some hold it so, tha[t] Creete can breed no Owle, And Crowes in Athens were neuer seen at least that England breedes no wolues, an error foule. Cymerians blinde, that haunts Trop[h]onius Caue, could neuer bide the shining Sunne in sight, Who still in darknesse dwell, the light doe neuer craue, but like Cacus Captuies shrouded aie with night. A simple Goat could asswage god Faunus ire, a grunting hog could Neptunes rage appease, A seelie Cocke could coole Asculapius fire, but Lions cround, the bull of Rome must please. His Dan and Bethell, sacred Pantheon cald, his sinagoge esteemes no Oxe, no Calfe, no Bull, But blood of kings in Royall seates enstald, wherein Perillus part he plaies at full. No fire in Rome could Romulus staffe consume, no meanes might make king Pyrrhus toes to burne But Pope with Næuius knife euer durst presume, with Briers and Brambles make Cædar trees to mourn. But might these mates haue had but Aarons rod in hand or could haue borrowed Elias cloke no doubt, They had made the Seas, on both sides for to stand, that Fraunce and Spaine might make the slaughter out. Their Dagon fell, our sacred Arke stood vp, their Pharao myst, our Moses did preuaile, Their crosse was downe, our crowne did neuer stoupe, Their Barge did sinke, our Ship top gallant saile, Noughtie Nabals curse on Dauid neuer fell: Achitophels cruel counsaile did no good to Absalon, when Absalon did rebell: Semei could doe no harme, when Semei God withstood. Elizeus bones could raise the Dead from graue, Peters shadowe passing by, made sicke men hole. Paules handkercher from death, did many saue, thus vertue deales to vertuous men her dole But Bulles of Rome and Beares of Hispaine did more, they murther whom they will, and pardon whom they list, Kings from crownes depriue, and Kings to crownes restore, thus to shadow Cæsars state, the Pope hath euer wisht. If Dathan and Abiron sanke for treason wrought, if Assur, Pharo so enuied Dauids seat, If Greekes Iewes and Gentiles Iacobs starre haue sought, these Gorgons would Eliza faine from Crowne defeat. When Perseus sword shall snatch of Medusas head, when Mercuries whistle lulls Argos eies to sleep, When Phœbus faulchion kils monstrous Python dead, then shall Eliza make Romane Cerberus creepe. Though still you beare the Oliue branch in breast, yet some wish you Hermes Harpen in your hand, Though you the Lambe imbrace, the Lion is your beast, for mercie must with iustice ioine to rule a land. Cleanse Augeus hall, destroy Stymphalides seede, your souldiers readie preast, do stand in aray, Thunders, hailstones, brimstone, fier, your foes shal speede Angels armd, hosts from hie, God himself will say. To Cumæ trudge, of Sibill knowe your fates, to Ammons priests, at Ammons temple scrape. To Delphos post, call and knock at Phœbus gates, to knowe of Phœbus how traitors best may scape. No Iewell, Gemme, no goulde to giue I had, no Indian stones, no Persean gaze in hand. No pearles from Pactolus to a Prince, yet glad, these happie Halcions daies to see in Britaine land. FINIS q?. L.

[No place commendes the man vnworthie praise.] No place commendes the man vnworthie praise. No title of state doth stay vp vices fall: No wicked wight to wo can make delayes, No loftie lookes preserue the proude at all No brags or boast, no stature high and tall, No lusty yought, no swearing, stareing stout, No brauerie, banding, cogging, cutting out. Then what availes to haue a Princly place, A name of honour or an high degree, To come by kindred of a noble race? Except wee Princely, worthie, noble be. The fruites declare the goodnes of the tree. Doe br[a]gge no more, of birth or linage than, ffor vertue, grace, and manners make the man. 3.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [How can he rule well in a common wealth] How can he rule well in a common wealth, Which knoweth not himselfe in rule to frame? How should he rule himselfe in ghostly health Which neuer learn'd one lesson for the same? If such catch harme their parents are to blame: ffor needes must they be blinde, and blindly led, Where no good lesson can be taught or read. Some thinke their youth discreete and wisely taught, That brag, and boast, and weare their fether braue, Can royst and rout, both lowre and looke aloft, Can sweare and stare, and call their fellowes knaue, Can pill and poll, and catch before they craue, Can carde and dice, both cog and foyste at fare, Play on vnthriftie, till their purse be bare. Some teach their youth to pipe, to sing and daunce, To hauke, to hunt, to choose and kill their game. To winde their horne, and with their horse to praunce, To play at tennis, set the lute in frame, Run at the ring, and vse such other game: Which feats although they be not all vnfit, Yet cannot they the marke of vertue hit. ffor Noble yought there is nothing so meete As learning is, to knowe the good from ill: To know the tongues, and perfectly endyte, And of the lawes to haue a perfect skill, Thinges to reforme as right and iustice will: ffor honnour is ordeyned for no cause But to see right maintayned by the lawes. 4.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [What liquor first the earthen pot doth take] What liquor first the earthen pot doth take, It keepeth still the sauour of the same. ffull hard it is a Camocke straight to make, Or wainscot fyne with crooked logges to frame. Tis hard to make the cruell Tiger tame. And so it fares with those haue vices caught: Naught once (they say) and euer after naught. I speake no[t] this as though it past all cure ffrom vices vile to vertue to retire: But this I say, if vice be once in vre, The more you shall to quite your selfe require, The more you plunge yo? selfe in fulsome mire, As he that striues in soakte quicke sirts of sand, Still sinkes, scarce euer comes againe to land. 5.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [O loath that Loue whose fynall ayme is Lust] O loath that Loue whose fynall ayme is Lust Moth of the mynde, Eclipse of Reasons light The graue of Grace, the mole of Natures Rust The wracke of witt, the wronge of euery wight. In Su?e an euill, whose harmes no tonge can tell In w?h to Liue is death, to dye is Hell. 6.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [The brainsicke race that wanton youth ensues] The brainsicke race that wanton youth ensues, Without regard to grounded wisdomes lore, As often as I thinke thereon, renues The fresh remembrance of an ancient sore: Reuoking to my pensiue thoughts at last, The worlds of wickednes that I haue past. And though experience bids me bite on bit, And champe the bridle of a bitter smacke, Yet costly is the price of after wit, Which brings so cold repentance at hir backe: And skill that's with so many losses bought, Men say is little better worth than nought. And yet this fruit, I must confesse, doth growe Of follies scourge: that though I now complaine Of error past, yet henceforth I may knowe To shun the whip that threats the like againe: For wise men though they smart a while, had leuer To learne experience at the last, than neuer. 7.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [I feare not death, feare is more paine] I feare not death, feare is more paine then death it selfe to courage true: In youth who dies or else is slaine paies nature but a debt y?? due. Who yongest dies he doth [but] paye a debt (he owes) before the daye And such a debte longer to haue doth nothinge profite men at all Death is a debt nature doth craue and must be pay'd by great &amp; small.

A Dittie, wherein is contained divers good and necessary documents, which beeing embraced and followed earnestly, may cause a man to shunne manie evilles and mischaunces, that may otherwise fall upon him, ere he can beware.The attribution of this poem is questionable. This Ditty may be sung to the high ‘Allemaigne Measure’; singing every last straine twise with the musicque. ‘Softe fire makes sweete mault,’ they say; Few words well plast the wise will way. Time idle spent, in trifles vaine, Returnes no guerdon for thy paine: But time well spent, doth profite bring, And of good works will honour spring. Bestow thy time then in such sort, That vertue may thy deedes support: The greater profite thou shalt see, And better fame will goe of thee. In talke be sober, wise, and sadde, Faire to thy freend, kind to the badde; And let thy words so placed bee As no man may finde fault with thee. Nor meddle not in any case With matters which thy witte surpasse: With things that not to thee pertaines, It folly were to beate thy braines; For sudden blame may hap to thee, In medling unadvisedly. Take heede, in any wise, I say, What things thou goest about to-day, That thou to-morrow not repent, And with thy selfe be discontent. Speake not such words to others' blame, As afterward may turne thee shame. To-day thou speakest, and doost not care, But of tomorrow still beware: For then thou canst not call againe, What lavishly did passe thy braine. Keepe secrete closely in thy minde Things that thy state and credite binde; Beware, if thou doo them disclose, To whom and where, for feare of foes: Especially of him take heede Whose trueth thou doost not know in deede. For hard it is thy freend to know From him that is a flattering foe: And many men in showe are kind, Yet worse then serpents in their mind. Be not too hasty in thy deedes; Of too much haste oft harme proceedes. Be sober, mute; take good advise, For things too much are full of vice. With moderation rule thee so, As thou aside no way maist go: For ‘haste makes waste,’ as proofe dooth say, And little said, soone mend ye may. Forecast what after may befall; So shalt thou not be rashe at all. Have minde still of thine owne offence, Regard thy faults with good pretence: Seeke not a moate in one to spie, First pull the beame out of thine eye. And find no fault with any man, Except amend thy selfe thou can: And when thy faults amended be, The good that others see in thee, Will learne them so their deedes to frame, As they may likewise scape from blame. Of no man give thou bad report, Backbite not any in thy sport: For words doo wound as deepe as swords, Which many use in jesting boordes; And slaunder is a hainous hate, Which dooth nought els but stirre debate; And twixt good freendes makes deadly strife, To hazard one another's life: And all this may proceede of thee, Except thou wilt advised bee. Beare freendly with thy neighbours fault, Remember thou thy selfe maist halt. If he hath ought offended thee, Forgive, as thou the like wouldest be: And thinke, if thou hast gone awrie, Thou for forgivenesse must apply: So with thy neighbour's faults doo beare, And of thine owne stand still in feare. Pardon as thou wouldest pardoned be, So God will pardon him and thee. Be gentle unto every wight, Let courtesie be thy delight: Familiar be with few, I say; For sure it is the wisest waie. Too much familiaritie May bring thy sorrowes suddainly: Therefore, keepe gentlenesse in mind; To rich and poore be alwaies kind: So pride shall never conquere thee, Which is man's cheefest enemie. 14. A Dittie, wherein the brevitie of man's life is described, how soone his pompe vanisheth away, and he brought to his latest home.The attribution of this poem is questionable. This Ditty may be sung to the ‘Venetian Allemaigne.’ The statelie pine whose braunches spreade so faire, By winde or weather wasted is at length; The sturdie oake that clymeth in the ayre, In time dooth lose his beautie and his strength; The fayrest flower that florisht as to daie, To-morrow seemeth like the withered haie. So fares it with the present state of man, Whose showe of healthe dooth argue manie yeeres: But as his life is likened to a span, So suddaine sicknes pulles him from his peeres; And where he seemde for longer time to-daie, To-morrow lies he as a lumpe of clay. The infant yong, the milk-white aged head, The gallant youth that braveth with the best, We see with earth are quickly over-spreade, And both alike brought to their latest rest: As soone to market commeth to be solde, The tender lambe's skin, as the weather's old. Death is not partiall: as the proverbe saies, The prince and peasant both with him are one; The sweetest face that's painted now a daies, And highest head, set forth with pearle and stone, When he hath brought them to the earthly grave, Beare no more reckoning then the poorest slave. The wealthy chuffe, that makes his gold his god, And scrapes and scratches all the mucke he may; And with the world dooth play at even and od; When Death thinks good to take him hence away, Hath no more ritches in his winding-sheete, Then the poore soule that sterved in the streete. Unhappie man! that runneth on thy race, Not minding where thy crased bones must rest: But woe to thee that doost forget thy place, Purchast for thee, to live amongst the blest. Spend then thy life in such a good regard, That Christe's blessing may be thy reward! 15. A Glasse for all Men to behold themselves in; especially such proude and prodigall-minded Men, and such delicate and daintie Women, ‘who building on the pride of their beautie and amiable complexion, thinke scorne to become aged; and that their sweete faces should be wrinckled, or their youthfulnes brought into subjection by age.The attribution of this poem is questionable. This Ditty may be sung to the ‘Earle of Oxenford's Galliard.’ You youthfull heads, whose climing mindes Doo seeke for worldly praise, Whose yong desires doo seeme to scorne Olde age's staied waies. Beare with the plaine-song of my note, Which is so plaine in deede, As daintie mindes will scant endure So harshe a tale to reade. As nature hath endued your shapes With exquisite perfection; And gives you choyse of sweete delights, Wherein you have affection: When time hath runne his course in you, The selfe-same nature saies— That all these daintie toyes must die, Whereof you made your praise. Marke how the yeere in course doth passe: Note first the plesant spring; The earth by nature then affoordes Full many a precious thing: Of fruits, of flowres, of wholsome hearbes We gather as we please; And all things els we lacke beside, Our needfull wants to ease. And likewise, in this pleasant time, We take delight to walke, To run and play at barley-breake, And in our gardens talke; One freend an other dooth invite, They feast and make good cheere; Both rich and poore doo make pastime, At this time of the yeere. But wreakfull winter drawing on, Withdraweth these delights, And robbes us of them, one by one, As toyes and trifling sights. The scith cuttes downe the goodlie grasse, That grew so greene to day; And all the sweete and pleasant flowers Are changed then to hay. The trees, that bragged in their leaves, The bitter blasts doo bight; And chaunge them from their goodly state To olde and withered plight: And they that flocked to the feeldes, When summer was so brave, Nowe closelie creepe about the fire For winter warmth will have. Compare we now the yeerely chaunge, With man's appointed race, Who in the Aprill of his age Greene humours dooth embrace: And as Maie-flowers glad the eye, So in his youthfull time, Man compasseth a world of joyes, Whereto his thoughts doo clime. Behold, likewise, dame Beautie's gyrles, Whose daintie mindes are such, As not the sun-shine, nor the wind, Must their faire faces touch: Theyr maskes, their fannes, and all the toyes, That wanton heads can crave, To maintaine beautie in her pride, These prancking dames must have. But elder yeeres approching on A little every daie, Their daintie beautie dooth decline, And vanisheth away. And as colde Winter chaseth hence The pleasant Summer daies, So withered age encountreth youth, Amidst his wanton waies. You that thinke scorne of auncient age, And hold him in contempt, To make of beautie such a price, And to vaine thoughts are bent. Remember Nature yeelds to course, And course his race will have, From the first howre of your byrth Untill you come to grave. Age is an honour unto them That live to see the same, And none but vaine and foolish hands Will blot olde age with blame; Who oftentimes are soone cut off, And not so happy blest, To see the dayes their fathers did, Before they went to rest. Thrise happy they that spend their youth In good and vertuous wise. Forsaking all such vaine desires As wanton heads surmise, And wholie doo direct themselves Unto his will that made them, Then Folly never can have power From Vertue to disswade them. II. Early Love-Poems: BEFORE 1580? 16.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Who loues and would his suite should proue] Who loues and would his suite should proue [To] winn his Mistress to his will, That she likes he must seeme to loue And what she loues co?end it still. Then at fitt time preferr yo? sute Let not sharpe answers strike yo? mute. Their Castells on such ground are sett as vndermyninge may them take The walls so weake no strength can lett shott soone therein a breache will make Their forces are so weake within small pow? serues their forts to win. If men haue tongues to craue &amp; pray aswell as women to deny No stronger is their no or nay then force of wise mens yes or I. For mens perswations stronger are then womens noes are much by farr. Their no is weake &amp; blunt also such weapons weakely do defend Mens yea so sharpe will pierce their no and Conquer them if they contend. Then feare not force, where force is none least feare yo? force, do ouercome There Sex withstands not place (if fitt[)] no[r] speache, for be she base or hie A womans ey doth guide hir witt hir witt doth neuer guide hir eye Then senceles is he y? can speake feares to the best his loue to breake. The brauer mart the better matche and willinger of all is sought And willinge sute doth euer catche foule Vulcan so faire Venus cought Were she a Quene she would be wonne if cu?ingly yo? race you runne. He that can rubb hir gamesome vaine and also temper toyes with art Makes Loue swim at hir eies amaine and so to diue into hir hart Their Sex are weake, weake forts ca?ott w??stand the force of Ca?on shott. I argue not of hir estate but all my rest I sett on this That oportunity will mate and winn the coyest she y? is. for to be Courted they desire to further pleasure to aspire. The towne w?? will to parly co?e will yeld to peace (though hye in state) And those no doubt will soone be wonne y? courtinge loue which none do hate. If bloody warres they ment to vse perswations milde they would refuse. Although they seeme to scorne loues beck and in all shew the same to hate And though at first they giue y? check at last they gladly take the mate. for pleasure they to play beginn in sport they lose in sport they winn. In words &amp; lookes theis Ladies braue haue coye disdaine voide of loues fire But in their mindes &amp; harts they haue a feruent and a hote desire. Reiectinge words mens suits deny alluringe iestures do say yea. Courtinge makes them stoope to lure and guiftes reclaimes them to the fist And with y? bridle and saddle sure you well may ride them where yo? list In such cariers they run on still y? yo? may breake yo? Launce at will. If bewtifull a Lady be with praises great you must hir moue: If witty then be wonn will she w?? fine conceites the art of loue. If coye she be w?? prayers sue, if proude then guifts must pleade for youe. If Couetous she be indeede with promises you must assay: If wayward then w?? force proceede. but all the fault on bewtie lay: And in one instant also vse some rare delight w?? a iust excuse. Sayinge thus: yo? bewty doth me drawe and eke compell me this to doe No faulte in me for as the strawe drawne by pure Iett must leape thereto So I beinge forc'd deserue no blame sith that yo? bewty forc'd the same. When you haue don no doubt but she the better like and loue you will faire Helen may example be howe Menelaus she hated still His softnes made him woo in vaine she did his humblenes disdaine. Enforcinge Paris she did loue and like for forcinge hir so well That greatest dangers she would proue with him for to remaine &amp; dwell. yet she confest as it was righte the Gretian was the better knighte. But Menelaus takes hart, and soe by force recouers hir againe By force makes hir with him to goe by force enioyes hir not in vaine for when he manlike Deedes did vse to yeld to him she could not chuse. And she y? neuer like him coulde for seruice and for reuerence Did euer after deare him holde and loue him eke for violence Tis modesty that they refraine what they refuse they would haue faine. Though women striue &amp; disagree they meane not for to ouerco?e, Though they full angrie seeme to be well pleas'd they are when well tis do?e. They would not striue nor yet denye but y? mens forces they would trye. The modestie of Men I finde they like not, yet it praises lend They hate the fearefull dasterd minde that offers not for feare t'offend Then feare not for to beard the best kindely they kindenes will digest. If that she do dislike before you do attempt hir for to win, Then she can do at last no more howe euer you hir vse therein. With lyinge still no forte is gott nor Castell battered w??out shott. And women thinke there is no fire where they no sparkes of furie see for to be courted they desire though they in shew displeased bee. In womens mouthes in case of loue no, no negatiue will proue. A wom?s hart and tongue by kinde should not be Relatiues alwaye Neither is y? Prouerbe true I finde What hart doth thinke, y? tongue doth say They like y? Lapwinge off do flye and farthest from their Nests do crye. They vse denialls &amp; sharpe quippes not for because they do not loue But partly for to shew their witts and eke mens constancie to proue. Though they refuse it will appeare tis but th'obtayninge to endeare. If women were not frendly foes beinge hable for to ouercome They would not softly strike w?? noes nor yet vnto a parley co?e. Or if mens suites they did disdaine to answer them they would refraine. Take heede do not at first shott yelde their tongues will once the battell sounde At last you sure shall winn the field if that you well, will keepe yo? grounde If that y? forte she hold out longe the next assaults then make more stronge. When as a fearfull Horsman backs a ready horse the horse will bounde And for to leape he neuer slacks till he hath throwne him to the grounde But if a horsman good he finde will sitt him close he yeldes by kinde. Vnworthy life y? Hounde we deeme w?? giues y? chase of at first fault So of such men they not esteeme for one repulse w?? leaues th'assault That loue is weakely built they knowe w?? one denyall downe doth blowe. If y? in chase so ill you holde as for one faulte to leaue the same They will suppose yo? suite is colde and thinke you care not for y? game. for women this account do make they will say no and yet will take. The Souldio? faint w?? standeth still in battell fearing Enemies sight Is sooner slaine then he y? will the brauest onsett giue in fighte Then if you loue be not afraide to beard the best as I haue saide. 17. Of lingeringe Loue.The attribution of this poem is questionable. 1 In lingeringe Loue mislikinge growes, Wherby our fancies ebbs and flowes: We love to day, and hate to morne, And dayly wher we list to scorne. Take heede therfore, If she mislike, then love no more: Quicke speed makes waste, Loue is not gotten in such haste. 2 The sute is colde that soone is done, The forte is feeble easly wonne: The haulke that soone comes by her pray, may take a Toye and sore away. Marke what means this, Some thincke to hitt &amp; yet they misse: ffirst creepe, then goe, Me thinke[s] our loue is handled soe. 3 ffor lacke of Bellowes the fire goes out, Some say, the next way is about: ffew thinges are had without some sute, The tree at first will beare no fruite. Serue longe, Hope well, Loe heere is all that I can tell: Tyme tries out troth, And troth is likt' wher ere it goth. 4 Some thincke all theirs that they doe seeke, Some wantons wooe but for a weeke: Some wooe to shew their subtile witte, Such Palfreyes play vpon their bitte. ffine heads god knowes, That plucke a nettle for a rose: They meete their mach, And fare the woorsse because they snach. 5 We silly women can not rest, for Men that love to woe in iest: Some lay their baite in ev'ry nooke, And ev'ry fish doth spie their hooke. Ill ware, good cheape, Which makes vs looke before we leape; Craft, can cloke much, God saue all simple soules from such. 6 Though lingeringe Loue be lost some while, Yet lingeringe louers laugh and smile: Who will not linger for a day, May banish hope and happ away. Loue must be plide, Who thinckes to sayle must wayte y? tide: Thus ends this dance: God send all ling'rers happie chance. Finis. 18. A Warning for Wooers,The attribution of this poem is questionable. that they be not over hastie, nor deceived with womens beautie. To—‘Salisburie Plaine.’ Ye loving wormes, come learne of me, The plagues to leave that linked be; The grudge, the grief, the gret anoy, The fickle faith, the fading ioy, In time take heed; In fruitlesse soile sow not thy seed: Buie not, with cost, The thing that yeelds but labour lost. If Cupids dart do chance to light, So that affection dimmes thy sight; Then raise up reason, by and by, With skill thy heart to fortifie; Where is a breach, Oft times too late doth come the Leach: Sparks are put out, When furnace flames do rage about. Thine owne delay must win the field, When lust doth leade thy heart to yeeld: When steed is stolne, who makes al fast, May go on foot for al his haste: In time shut gate, For had I wist, doth come too late: Fast bind, fast find; Repentance alwaies commeth behind. The Syrens tunes oft time beguiles, So doth the teares of Crocodiles; But who so learnes Ulysses lore, May passe the seas, and win the shore. Stop eares, stand fast, Through Cupids trips, thou shalt him cast; Flie baits, shun hookes, Be thou not snarde with lovely lookes. Where Venus hath the maisterie, There love hath lost her libertie: Where love doth win the victorie, The fort is sackt with crueltie. First look, then leap, In suretie so your skinnes you keepe; The snake doth sting, That lurking lieth with hissing. Where Cupids fort hath made a waie, There grave advise doth beare no swaie; Where love doth raigne, and rule the roste, There reason is exilde the coast: Like all, love none, Except ye use discretion: First try, then trust, Be not deceived with sinful lust. Marke Priams sonne, his fond devise, When Venus did obtaine the prise; For Pallas skil, and Junoes strength, He chose that bred his bane, at length. Choos wit, leave wil, Let Helen be with Paris stil: Amis goeth al Wher fancie forceth fooles to fall. Where was there found a happier wight Than Troylus was, til love did light? What was the end of Romeus? Did he not die, like Piramus? Who baths in blis, Let him be mindful of Iphis: Who seeks to plese, May ridden be, like Hercules. I lothe to tel the peevish brawles, And fond delights, of Cupids thrawles; Like Momish mates of Midas mood, They gape to get that doth no good: Now down, now up, As tapsters use to tosse the cup: One breedeth ioy, Another breeds as great anoy. Some love for wealth, and some for hue, And none of both these loves are true: For when the mil hath lost her sailes, Then must the miller lose his vailes: Of grasse commeth hay, And flowers faire wil soon decay: Of ripe commeth rotten; In age al beautie is forgotten. Some loveth too hie, and some too lowe, And of them both great griefs do grow; And some do love the common sort, And common folke use common sport. Looke not too hie, Least that a chip fall in thine eie: But hie or lowe, Ye may be sure she is a shrow. But, Sirs, I use to tell no tales; Ech fish that swims doth not beare scales; In everie hedge I find not thornes; Nor everie beast doth carrie hornes: I saie not so, That everie woman causeth wo: That were too broad; Who loveth not venom, must shun the tode. Who useth still the truth to tel, May blamed be, though he saie wel: Say crowe is white, and snowe is blacke, Lay not the fault on woman's backe; Thousands were good, But few scapte drowning in Noes flood: Most are wel bent; I must say so, least I be shent. FINIS. 19. A Proper Sonet,The attribution of this poem is questionable. intituled, ‘I smile to see how you devise.’ To anie pleasant Tune. I smile to see how you devise New masking nets my eies to bleare; Your self you cannot so disguise, But as you are, you must appeare. Your privie winkes at boord I see, And how you set your raving mind: Your self you cannot hide from me, Although I wincke, I am not blind. The secret sighs, and fained cheare, That oft doth paine thy carefull brest, To me right plainly doth appeare; I see in whom thy hart doth rest. And though [thou] makest a fained vow, That love no more thy heart should nip; Yet think I know, as well as thou, The fickle helm doth guide the ship. The salamander in the fire, By course of kinde, doth bathe his limmes: The floting fish taketh his desire In running streames, whereas he swimmes. So thou in change doth take delight; Ful wel I know thy slipperie kinde: In vaine thou seemst to dim my sight, Thy rowling eies bewraieth thy minde. I see him smile, that doth possesse Thy love, which once I honoured most: If he be wise, he may well gesse, Thy love, soon won, wil soon be lost. And sith thou canst no man intice, That he should stil love thee alone; Thy beautie now hath lost her price, I see thy savorie sent is gone. Therefore, leave off thy wonted plaie; But as thou art thou wilt appeare, Unlesse thou canst devise a waie To dark the sun, that shines so cleare. And keep thy friend, that thou hast won; In trueth to him thy love supplie; Least he at length, as I have done, Take off thy belles, and let thee flie. 20.The attribution of this poem is questionable.

[Like to a Hermite poore in place obscure] Like to a Hermite poore in place obscure, I meane to spend my daies of endles doubt, To waile such woes as time cannot recure, Where none but Loue shall euer finde me out. My foode shall be of care and sorow made, My drink nought else but teares falne from mine eies, And for my light in such obscured shade, The flames shall serue, which from my hart arise. A gowne of graie, my bodie shall attire, My staffe of broken hope whereon Ile staie, Of late repentance linckt with long desire, The couch is fram'de whereon my limbes Ile lay, And at my gate dispaire shall linger still, To let in death when Loue and Fortune will. 24.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [I saw my Lady weepe] I saw my Lady weepe, And sorrow proud to bee aduanced so, In those faire eies, where all perfections keepe: Hir face was full of woe, But such a woe (beleeue me) as wins more hearts, Then mirth can doe with hir intysing parts. Sorow was there made faire, And passion wise, teares a delightfull thing, Silence beyond all speech a wisdome rare, Shee made hir sighes to sing, And all things with so sweet a sadnesse moue, As made my heart at once both grieue and loue. O fayrer then ought ells, The world can shew, leaue of in time to grieue, Inough, inough, your ioyfull lookes excells, Teares kills the heart belieue, O striue not to bee excellent in woe, Which onely breeds your beauties ouerthrow.

[Farewell false loue, the oracle of lyes] Farewell false loue, the oracle of lyes, A mortal foe, &amp; enimie to rest: An enuious boy, from whome all cares aryse, A bastard vile, a beast with rage possest: A way of error, a temple ful of treason, In all effects contrarie vnto reason. A poysoned serpent couered all with flowers, Mother of sighes, and murtherer of repose, A sea of sorows fr? wh?ce are draw? such showers, As moysture lend to euerie griefe that growes, A school of guile, a net of deepe deceit, A guilded hooke, that holds a poysoned bayte. A fortress foyled, which reason did defend, A Syren song, a feauer of the minde, A maze wherein affection finds no ende, A raging cloude that runnes before the winde, A substance like the shadow of the Sunne, A goale of griefe for which the wisest runne. A quenchlesse fire, a nurse of trembling feare, A path that leads to perill and mishap, A true retreat of sorrow and dispayre, An idle boy that sleepes in pleasures lap, A deepe mistrust of that which certaine seemes, A hope of that which reason doubtfull deemes. Finis. 26.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [When younglyngs first on Cupide fyxe their sight] When younglyngs first on Cupide fyxe their sight, And see him naked, blyndfold &amp; a boy, Though bow &amp; shafts and fier-brand be his might, Yet weene they he can worke them none annoy. And therefore with his purpill wings they play, For glorious semeth loue though light as fether, And when they haue done they weene to skape away, For blynd men, say they, shoote they know not whether. But when by proofe they finde that he did see, &amp; that his wound did rather dym their sight, They wonder more how such a lad as he, Should be of such surpassing powre and might: But Ants haue gals, so hath the Bee his styng, Then sheeld me heauens from such a subtyle thing. 27.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [When I was otherwise then now I am] When I was otherwise then now I am, I loued more but skilled not so much: Fayre wordes and smyles could haue contented than, My simple age &amp; ignorance was such: But at the length experience made me wonder, That harts &amp; tongues did lodge so farre asunder. As watermen which on the Teames do row Looke to the East, but West keepes on the way, My Soueraigne sweet, her countenance setled so, To feede my hope while she her snares might laye. And when she sawe that I was in her danger, Good God, how soone she proued then a ranger. I could not choose but laugh although to late, To see great craft diszifered in a toye, I loue her still, but such conditions hate, Which so prophanes my Paradice of ioy. Loue whetts the witts, whose paine is but a pleasure, A toy, by fitts, to play withall at leasure. 28.

[Feede still thy selfe, thou fondling with beliefe] Feede still thy selfe, thou fondling with beliefe, Go hunt thy hope, that neuer tooke effect, Accuse the wrongs that oft hath wrought thy griefe, And reckon sure where reason would suspect. Dwell in the dreames of wish and vaine desire, Pursue the faith that flies and seekes to new, Run after hopes that mocke thee with retire, And looke for loue where liking neuer grew. Deuise conceits to ease thy carefull hart, Trust vpon times and daies of grace behinde, Presume the rights of promise and desart, And measure loue by thy beleeuing minde. Force thy affects that spite doth daily chace, Winke at thy wrongs with wilfull ouersight, See not the soyle and staine of thy disgrace, Nor recke disdaine, to doate on thy delite. And when thou seest the end of thy reward, And these effects ensue of thine assault, When rashnes rues, that reason should regard, Yet still accuse thy fortune for the fault. And crie, O Loue, O death, O vaine desire, When thou complainst the heate, and feeds[t] the fire. 30.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Those eies which set my fancie on a fire] Those eies which set my fancie on a fire, Those crisped haires, which hold my hart in chains, Those daintie hands, which conquer'd my desire, That wit, which of my thoughts doth hold the rains. Those eies for cleerenes doe the starrs surpas, Those haires obscure the brightnes of the Sunne, Those hands more white, than euer Iuorie was, That wit euen to the skies hath glorie woon. O eies that pearce our harts without remorse, O haires of right that weares a roiall crowne, O hands that conquer more than Cæsars force, O wit that turns huge kingdoms vpside downe. Then Loue be Judge, what hart can thee withstand: Such eies, such haire, such wit, and such a hand. 31.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Those eies that holds the hand of euery hart] Those eies that holds the hand of euery hart, Those hands that holds the hart of euery eie, That wit that goes beyond all natures art, That sence, too deepe, for wisdome to descrie, That eie, that hand, that wit, that heauenly sence, All these doth show my Mistres Excellence. Oh eies that perce into the purest hart, Oh hands that hold, the highest harts in thrall, Oh wit that weyes the deapth of all desart, Oh sence that showes the secret sweete of all, The heauen of heauens, with heuenly powrs preserue thee, Loue but thy selfe, and giue me leaue to serue thee. To serue, to liue, to looke vpon those eies, To looke, to liue, to kisse that heauenlie hand, To sound that wit, that doth amaze the wise, To knowe that sence, no sence can vnderstand, To vnderstande that all the world may know, Such wit, such sence, eies, hands, there are no moe. 32.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [By wracke late driuen on shore, from Cupids Crare] By wracke late driuen on shore, from Cupids Crare, Whose sailes of error, sighes of hope and feare, Conueied through seas of teares, and sands of care, Till rocks of high disdaine, hir sides did teare, I write a dirge, for dolefull doues to sing, With selfe same quill, I pluckt from Cupids wing. Farewell vnkinde, by whom I fare so ill, Whose looks bewitcht my thoughts with false surmise, Till forced reason did vnbinde my will, And shewed my hart, the follie of mine eies, And saide, attending where I should attaine, Twixt wish and want, was but a pleasing paine. Farewell vnkinde, my floode is at an ebbe My troubled thoughts, are turnd to quiet wars, My fancies hope hath spun and spent hir webbe, My former wounds are closed vp with skars, As ashes lie, long since consumde with fire, So is my loue, so now is my desire. Farewell vnkinde, my first and finall loue, Whose coie contempts, it bootes not heere to name, But gods are iust, and euery star aboue, Doth threat reuenge, where faiths reward is blame, And I may liue, though your despised thrall, By fond mischoyce, to see your fortunes fall. Farewell vnkinde, most cruell of your kinde, By whom my worth, is drowned in disdaines, As was my loue, so is your iudgement blinde, My fortune ill, and such hath beene my gaines, But this for all, I list no more to saie, Farewell faire proude, not lifes, but loues decaie. 33. A Counterloue.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Declare, O minde, from fond desires excluded, That thou didst find erewhile, by Loue deluded. An eie, the plot, whereon Loue sets his gin, Beautie, the trap, wherein the heedles fall, A smile, the traine, that drawes the simple in, Sweete words, the wilie instrument of all, Intreaties posts, faire promises are charmes, Writing, the messenger, that wooes our harmes. Mistresse, and seruant, titles of mischaunce: Commaundments done, the act of slauerie, Their coulors worne, a clownish cognisaunce, And double dutie, pettie drudgerie, And when she twines and dallies with thy locks, Thy freedome then is brought into the stocks. To touch hir hand, hir hand bindes thy desire, To weare hir ring, hir ring is Nessus gift, To feele hir brest, hir brest doth blowe the fire, To see hir bare, her bare a baleful drift, To baite thine eies thereon, is losse of sight, To thinke of it, confounds thy senses quite. Kisses the keies, to sweete consuming sin, Closings, Cleopatras adders at thy brest, Fained resistance then she will begin, And yet vnsatiable in all the rest, And when thou doost vnto the act proceede, The bed doth grone, and tremble at the deede. Beautie, a siluer dew that falls in May, Loue is an Egshell, with that humor fild, Desire, a winged boy, comming that way, Delights and dallies with it in the field, The firie Sun, drawes vp the shell on hie, Beautie decaies, Loue dies, desire doth flie. Vnharmd giue eare, that thing is hap'ly caught, That cost some deere, if thou maist ha't for naught. 34. The Description of Iealousie.The attribution of this poem is questionable. A seeing friend, yet enimie to rest, A wrangling passion, yet a gladsom thought, A bad companion, yet a welcom guest, A knowledge wisht, yet found too soone vnsought, From heauen supposde, yet sure condemn'd to hell, Is Iealousie, and there forlorne doth dwell. And thence doth send fond feare and false suspect, To haunt our thoughts bewitched with mistrust, Which breedes in vs the issue and effect, Both of conceits and actions far vniust, The griefe, the shame, the smart wherof doth proue, That Iealousie's both death and hell to Loue. For what but hell moues in the iealous hart, Where restles feare works out all wanton ioyes, Which doth both quench and kill the louing part, And cloies the minde with worse than knowne annoyes, Whose pressure far exceeds hells deepe extreemes, Such life leads Loue entangled with misdeemes. 35. [Short is my rest, whose toile is ouerlong]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Short is my rest, whose toile is ouerlong, My ioyes are darke, but cleere I see my woe, My safetie small: great wracks I bide by wrong, Whose time is swift, and yet my hap but sloe, Each griefe and wound, in my poore hart appeeres, That laugheth howres, and weepeth many yeeres. Deedes of the day, are fables for the night, Sighes of desire, are smoakes of thoughtfull teares, My steps are false, although my paths be right, Disgrace is bolde, and fauor full of feares, Disquiet sleepe, keepes audit of my life, Where rare content, doth make displeasure rife. The dolefull bell, that is the voice of time, Cals on my end, before my haps be seene, Thus fals my hopes, whose harmes haue power to clime, Not come to haue that long in wish hath beene, I seeke your loue, and feare not others hate, Be you with me, and I haue Cæsars state. 36.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Praisd be Dianas faire and harmles light] Praisd be Dianas faire and harmles light, Praisd be the dewes, wherwith she moists the ground; Praisd be hir beames, the glorie of the night, Praisd be hir powre, by which all powres abound. Praisd be hir Nimphs, with whom she decks the woods, Praisd be hir knights, in whom true honor liues, Praisd be that force, by which she moues the floods, Let that Diana shine, which all these giues. In heauen Queene she is, among the spheares, In ay[er] she Mistres like makes all things pure, Eternitie in hir oft chaunge she beares, She beautie is, by hir the faire endure. Time weares hir not, she doth his chariot guide, Mortalitie belowe hir orbe is plaste, By hir the vertue of the starrs doune slide, In hir is vertues perfect image cast: A knowledge pure it is hir worth to kno, With Circes let them dwell that thinke not so. 37.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [My thoughts are wingde with hop[e]s, my hop[e]s with loue] My thoughts are wingde with hop[e]s, my hop[e]s with loue, Mo?t loue vnto the moone in cleerest night, And say as she doth in the heauens mooue In earth so wanes &amp; waxeth my delight: And whisper this but softly in her eares, Hope oft doth hang the head, and trust shed teares. And you my thoughts that some mistrust do cary, If for mistrust my mistrisse do you blame, Say though you alter, yet you do not varry, As she doth change, and yet remaine the same: Distrust doth enter harts, but not infect, And loue is sweetest seasned with suspect. If she for this, with cloudes do maske her eies, And make the heauens darke with her disdaine, With windie sighes disperse them in the skies, Or with thy teares dissolue them into raine; Thoughts, hopes, &amp; loue returne to me no more, Till Cynthia shine as she hath done before. 38. A Nimphs disdaine of Loue.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Hey downe a downe did Dian sing, amongst her Virgins sitting: Then loue there is no vainer thing, for Maydens most vnfitting, And so think I, with a downe downe derrie. When women knew no woe, but liu'd them-selues to please: Mens fayning guiles they did not know, the ground of their disease. Vnborne was false suspect, no thought of iealousie: From wanton toyes and fond affect, The Virgins life was free. Hey downe a downe did Dian sing &amp;c. At length men vsed charmes, to which what Maides gaue eare: Embracing gladly endlesse harmes, anone enthralled were. Thus women welcom'd woe, disguis'd in name of loue: A iealous hell, a painted show, so shall they finde that proue. Hey downe a downe did Dian sing, amongst her Virgins sitting: Then loue there is no vainer thing, for Maydens most vnfitting. And so thinke I, with a downe downe derrie. Finis. 39. The Nimphs reply to the Sheepheard.The attribution of this poem is questionable. If all the world and loue were young, And truth in euery Sheepheards tongue, These pretty pleasures might me moue, To liue with thee, and be thy loue. Time driues the flocks from field to fold, When Riuers rage, and Rocks grow cold, And Philomell becommeth dombe, The rest complaines of cares to come. The flowers doe fade &amp; wanton fieldes, To wayward winter reckoning yeeldes, A honny tongue, a hart of gall, Is fancies spring, but sorrowes fall. Thy gownes, thy shooes, thy beds of Roses, Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy poesies, Soone breake, soone wither, soone forgotten: In follie ripe, in reason rotten. Thy belt of straw and Iuie buddes, Thy Corall claspes and Amber studdes, All these in mee no meanes can moue, To come to thee, and be thy loue. But could youth last, and loue still breede, Had ioyes no date, nor age no neede, Then these delights my minde might moue, To liue with thee, and be thy loue. Finis. 40. Another of the same nature, made since.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Come liue with mee, and be my deere, And we will reuell all the yeere, In plaines and groaues, on hills and dales: Where fragrant ayre breedes sweetest gales. There shall you haue the beauteous Pine, The Cedar, and the spreading Vine, And all the woods to be a Skreene: Least Phœbus kisse my Sommers Queene. The seate for your disport shall be Ouer some Riuer in a tree, Where siluer sands, and pebbles sing, Eternall ditties with the spring. There shall you see the Nimphs at play, And how the Satires spend the day, The fishes gliding on the sands: Offering their bellies to your hands. The birds with heauenly tuned throates, Possesse woods Ecchoes with sweet noates, Which to your sences will impart, A musique to enflame the hart. Vpon the bare and leafe-lesse Oake, The Ring-Doues wooings will prouoke A colder blood then you possesse, To play with me and doo no lesse. In bowers of Laurell trimly dight, We will out-weare the silent night, While Flora busie is to spread: Her richest treasure on our bed. Ten thousand Glow-wormes shall attend, And all their sparkling lights shall spend, All to adorne and beautifie: Your lodging with most maiestie. Then in mine armes will I enclose Lillies faire mixture with the Rose, Whose nice perfections in loues play: Shall tune me to the highest key. Thus as we passe the welcome night, In sportfull pleasures and delight, The nimble Fairies on the grounds, Shall daunce and sing mellodious sounds. If these may serue for to entice, Your presence to Loues Paradice, Then come with me, and be my Deare: And we will straite begin the yeare. Finis. 41. Naturall comparisons with perfect loueThe attribution of this poem is questionable. The lowest Trees haue tops, the Ante her gall, The flie her splene, the little sparkes their heate: The slender haires cast shadowes, though but small, And Bees haue stings, although they be not great: Seas haue their sourse, &amp; so haue shallow springs, And loue is loue, in Beggars, as in Kings. Where riuers smoothest run, deepe are the foords, The Diall stirres, yet none perceiues it mooue: The firmest faith is in the fewest wordes, The Turtles cannot sing, and yet they loue: True Harts haue eyes, &amp; eares, no tongs to speake, They heare, &amp; see, and sigh, and then they breake. 41. An Answere to the first Staffe, that Loue is vnlike in Beggers and in Kings.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Compare the Bramble with the Cedar tree, The Pismyres anger with the Lyons rage: What is the Buzzing flie where Eagles bee? A drop the sparke, no seas can Aetna swage. Small is the heat in Beggers brests that springs, But flaming fire consumes the hearts of Kings. Who shrouds himself where slender hairs cast shade: But mighty Oakes may scorne the Summer Sun: Smal cure wil serue, wher Bees the wo?d haue made But Dragons poyson through each part doth run: Light is the loue that Beggers bosome stings, Deepe is the wound that Cupid makes in Kings. Smal channels serue, where shallow springs do slide, And little helpe will turne or stay their course: The highest banks scarce holde the swelling tide, Which ouer-throwes all stops with raging force: The baser sort scarce wett them in the springs, Which ouer-whelme the heads of mighty kings. What though in both the hart bee set of Loue? The self same ground both corne and cockle breeds Fast by the Bryer, the Pine-tree mounts aboue, One kinde of grasse, the Iade and Iennet feedes: So from the hart, by secret virtue springs, Vnlike desire in Beggers and in Kings. 42.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Praise blindnesse eies, for seeing is deceit] Praise blindnesse eies, for seeing is deceit, Bee dumbe vaine tongue, words are but flattering windes, Breake hart &amp; bleed for ther is no receit, To purge inconstancy from most mens mindes. And so I wackt amazd and could not moue, I know my dreame was true, and yet I loue. And if thine eares false Haralds to thy hart, Conuey into thy head hopes to obtaine, Then tell thy hearing thou art deafe by art, Now loue is art that wonted to be plaine, Now none is bald except they see his braines, Affection is not knowne till one be dead, Reward for loue are labours for his paines, Loues quiuer made of gold his shafts of leade. And so I wackt amazd and could not moue, I know my dreame was true, and yet I loue. 43.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [If fluds of teares could cleanse my follies past] If fluds of teares could cleanse my follies past, And smoakes of sighes might sacrifice for sinne, If groning cries might salue my fault at last, Or endles mone, for error pardon win, Then would I cry, weepe, sigh, and euer mone, Mine errors, fault, sins, follies past and gone. I see my hopes must wither in their bud, I see my fauours are no lasting flowers, I see that woords will breede no better good, Then losse of time and lightening but at houres, Thus when I see then thus I say therefore, That fauours hopes and words, can blinde no more. 44.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Farewell too faire, too chaste but too too cruell] Farewell too faire, too chaste but too too cruell, Discretion neuer quenched fire with swords: Why hast thou made my heart thine angers fuell, And now would kill my passions with thy words. This is prowd beauties true anatamy, If that secure seuere in secresie, farewell, farewell. Farewell too deare, and too too much desired, Vnlesse compassion dwelt more neere thy heart: Loue by neglect (though constant) oft is tired, And forc't from blisse vnwillingly to part. This is prowd beauties true anatamy If that secure seuere in secresie, farewell, farewell. 45.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [A Womans looks] A Womans looks Are barbed hooks, That catch by art The strongest hart When yet they spend no breath, But let them speake &amp; sighing break, Forth into teares, Their words are speares Y? wound our souls to death. The rarest wit Is made forget, And like a child Is oft beguild, With loues sweete seeming baite: Loue with his rod So like a God, Commands the mind, We cannot find Faire shewes hide fowle deceit. Time that all thinges In order bringes, Hath taught me now To be more slow, In giuing faith to speech: Since womens wordes No truth affordes, And when they kisse They thinke by this, Vs men to ouer-reach. 46.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Fond wanton youths make loue a God] Fond wanton youths make loue a God, Which after proueth ages rod, Their youth, their time, their wit, their arte, They spend in seeking of their smarte And which of follies is the chiefe, They wooe their woe, they wedde their griefe. All finde it so who wedded are, Loues sweetes they find enfold sowre care: His pleasures pleasingst in the eie, Which tasted once, with lothing die: They find of follies tis the chiefe, Their woe to wooe to wedde their griefe. If for their owne content they choose, Forthwith their kindreds loue they loose: And if their kindred they content, For euer after they repent. O tis of all our follies chiefe, Our woe to wooe to wedde our griefe. In bed what strifes are bred by day, Our puling wiues doe open lay: None friendes none foes we must esteeme, But whome they so vouchsafe to deeme: O tis of all our follies chiefe, Our woe to wooe to wedde our griefe. Their smiles we want if ought they want, And either we their wils must grant, Or die they will or are with child, Their longings must not be beguild: O tis of all our follies chiefe, Our woe to woo to wedde our griefe. Foule wiues are iealous, faire wiues false, Mariage to either bindes vs thrall: Wherefore being bound we must obey, And forced be perforce to say: Of all our blisse it is the chiefe, Our woe to wooe to wed our griefe. 47.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Once did I loue and yet I liue] Once did I loue and yet I liue, Though loue &amp; truth be now forgotten. Then did I ioy nowe doe I grieue, That holy vows must needs be broken. Hers be the blame that caus'd it so, Mine be the griefe though it be little, Shee shall haue shame I cause to know: What tis to loue a dame so fickle. Loue her that list I am content, For that Camelion like shee changeth, Yeelding such mistes as may preuent: My sight to view her when she rangeth. Let him not vaunt that gaines my losse, For when that he and time hath prou'd her, Shee may him bring to weeping crosse: I say no more because I lou'd her. 48.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Where lingring feare doth once posses the hart] Where lingring feare doth once posses the hart, There is the toong Forst to prolong, &amp; smother vp his suite, while that his smart, Like fire supprest, flames more in euery part. Who dares not speake deserues not his desire, The Boldest face, Findeth most grace: Though women loue that men should th? admire, They slily laugh at him dares come no higher. Some thinke a glaunce expressed by a sigh, Winning the field, Maketh them yeeld: But while these glauncing fooles do rowle the eie, They beate the bush, away the bird doth flie. A gentle hart in vertuous breast doth stay, Pitty doth dwell, In beauties cell: A womans hart doth not thogh tong say nay Repentance taught me this the other day. Which had I wist I presently had got, The pleasing fruite, Of my long suite: But time hath now beguild me of this lot, For that by his foretop I tooke him not. 49.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Hero care not though they prie] Hero care not though they prie, I will loue thee till I die, Ielousie is but a smart, That tormentes a ielous hart: Crowes are blacke that were white, For betraying loues delight. They that loue to finde a fault, May repent what they haue sought, What the fond eie hath not view'd, Neuer wretched hart hath rew'd: Vulcan then, prou'd a scorne, When he saw he wore a horne. Doth it then by might behoue, To shut vp the gates of loue, Women are not kept by force, But by natures owne remorse. If they list, they will stray, Who can hold that will away. Ioue in golden shower obtain'd, His loue in a towre restrain'd, So perhaps if I could doe, I might hold my sweete loue to: Gold keepe out at the doore, I haue loue that conquers more. Wherefore did they not suspect, When it was to some effect, Euery little glimmering sparke, Is perceiued in the darke: This is right, howlets kinde, See by night, by day be blinde. 50.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [When loue on time and measure makes his ground] When loue on time and measure makes his ground, Time that must end though loue can neuer die, Tis loue betwixt a shadow and a sound, A loue not in the hart but in the eie, A loue that ebbes and flowes now vp now downe, A mornings fauor and an euenings frowne. Sweete lookes shew loue, yet they are but as beames, Faire wordes seeme true, yet they are but as wind, Eies shed their teares yet are but outward streames: Sighes paint a sadnes in the falsest minde. Lookes, wordes, teares, sighes, shew loue when loue they leaue, False harts can weepe, sigh, sweare, and yet deceiue. 51.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Women, what are they, changing weather-cocks] Women, what are they, changing weather-cocks, That smallest puffes of lust haue power to turne, Women what are they, vertues stumbling blockes, Whereat weake fooles doe fall, the wiser spurne, Wee men, what are wee, fooles and idle boies, To spend our time in sporting with such toies. Women what are they? trees whose outward rinde, Makes shew for faire when inward hart is hollow: Women what are they? beasts of Hiænaes kinde, That speak those fairst, wh? most they meane to swallow: We men what are wee? fooles and idle boies, To spend our time in sporting with such toies. Women what are they? rocks vpon the coast, Where on we suffer shipwracke at our landing: Women what are they? patient creatures most, That rather yeld th? striue gainst ought withst?ding We men what are wee? fooles and idle boies, To spend our time in sporting with such toies. 52.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [If fathers knew but how to leaue] If fathers knew but how to leaue Their children wit as they do wealth, &amp; could constraine them to receiue That physicke which brings perfect health, Y? world would not admiring stand, A womans face and womans hand. Women confesse they must obey, We men will needes be seruants still: We kisse their hands and what they say, We must commend bee 't neuer so ill. Thus we like fooles admiring stand, Her pretty foote and pretty hand. We blame their pride which we increase, By making mountaines of a mouse: We praise because we know we please: Poore women are too credulous To thinke that we admiring stand, Or foote, or face, or foolish hand. 53.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [The fountaines smoake, and yet no flames they shewe] The fountaines smoake, and yet no flames they shewe, Starres shine all night, though undesern'd by day, And trees doe spring, yet are not seene to growe, And shadowes moove, although they seeme to stay, In Winter's woe is buried Summer's blisse, And Love loves most, when Love most secret is. The stillest streames descries the greatest deepe, The clearest skie is subject to a shower, Conceit's most sweete, whenas it seemes to sleepe, And fairest dayes doe in the morning lower; The silent groves sweete nimphes they cannot misse, For Love loves most, where Love most secret is. The rarest jewels hidden vertue yeeld, The sweete of traffique is a secret gaine, The yeere once old doth shew a barren field, And plants seeme dead, and yet they spring againe; Cupid is blind, the reason why is this: Love loveth most, where Love most secret is. V. Later Autobiographical: 1595–1600? 54.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Where wardes are weake, and foes encountering strong] Where wardes are weake, and foes encountering strong: Wher mightier doe assault, then do defend: The feebler part puts vp enforced wrong, And silent sees, that speach could not amend. Yet higher powers must thinke though they repine, When Sunne is set: the litle starres will shine. While Pike doth range, the silly Tench doth flye, And crouch in priuie creekes, with smaler fish: Yet Pikes are caught when litle fish goe bye: These, fleete a flote; while those, doe fill the dish. There is a tyme euen for the wormes to creepe: And sucke the dew while all their foes doe sleepe. The Marlyne cannot euer sore on high, Nor greedie Grey-hound still pursue the chase: The tender Larke will fynde a tyme to flie, And fearfull Hare to runne a quiet race. He that high growth on Ceders did bestow: Gaue also lowly Mushrumpts leaue to grow. Wee trample grasse, and prize the flowers of May: Yet grasse is greene, when flowers do fade away. 55.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Al ye wh? loue or fortune hath betraide] Al ye wh? loue or fortune hath betraide, All ye that dreame of blisse but liue in greif, Al ye whose hopes are euermore delaid, Al ye whose sighes or sicknes wants releife: Lend eares and teares to me most haples man, That sings my sorrowes like the dying Swanne. Care that consumes the heart with inward paine, Paine that presents sad care in outward vew, Both tyrant like enforce me to complaine, But still in vaine, for none my plaints will rue, Teares, sighes, and ceaseles cries alone I spend, My woe wants comfort, and my sorrow end. 56.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Come heauy sleepe, y? Image of true death] Come heauy sleepe, y? Image of true death: And close vp these my weary weeping eyes, Whose spring of tears doth stop my vitall breath, And tears my hart with sorrows sigh swoln crys: Com &amp; posses' my tired thoghts, worne soule, That liuing dies, till thou on me be stoule. Come shadow of my end: and shape of rest, Alied to death, child to this black fast night, Come thou and charme these rebels in my brest, Whose waking fancies doth my mind affright. O come sweet sleepe, come or I die for euer, Come ere my last sleepe coms, or [else] come neuer. 57. Concerninge his suit &amp; attenda?ce at y? Courte.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Moste miserable man, who?e wretched fate hath brought to Court, to sue for Had-I-wist: that few haue found, &amp; many one haue mist. Full little knowest thou, that hast not tride what Hell it is, in suinge longe to bide. To loose good dayes, that mighte be better spent, to waste longe nightes in pensiue discontent, To speed to day, &amp; be put back to morrowe, Now fedd w?? hope, now Crost w?? wailfull sorrow To haue thy Princes grace yet want hir Peeres, to haue thy askinge, yet waite many yeres. To frett thy soule with Crosses &amp; w?? cares, to eat thy hart w?? Comfortless dispaires: To fawne, to crouche, to waite, to bide, to run: To spend, to giue, to want, to be vndon. Vnhappy wighte, borne to disastrous end: That doth his life, in so longe tendance spend. Pereunt nil pariunt Anni, verte 58.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [The thundringe God whose all-embracinge powre] The thundringe God whose all-embracinge powre Circles ye modell of this spatious rounde When first he fram'd old Adams earthly bowre ordain'd all thinges t?' Emperiall vaile doth bound Should lend their aide to others mutuallie but all combinde serue man continuallie.

Man seru'd of all, seru'd none of all but God but mighte his pleasures take w??out controule Saue onely what Jehouah had forbod the carefull Soueraigne of his simple soule. This was y? age wise Poets term'd of gold for liberty in dearest prize they holde. But theis succeedinge Seasons arm'd in steele, Tramples hir downe &amp; in tryumphant sorte Not fearinge like contempts of fate to feele Leades hir as Captiue, mate to poorest sorte Yet Patience promis'd Liberty distrest should reape for paine, a gayne, for vnrest, rest. W?? Prophesy of hirs indeede mighte serue for a perswation that my seruice do?e would at y? length enfranchisem? deserue w?? aunsw? to mine expectation. But when I thinke twas Patience y? spoke the golden vessell of my hope is broke. For she's a Sainte &amp; scorninge vniust earth is fledd to heau'n. All vertues are ingros't In Gods owne hand, tis y? w?? breedes y? dearth of due rewardes, &amp; makes my labour lost Or at y? moste repaies my louinge minde w?? large delayes, vaine wordes &amp; so?e vnkinde. Since then y? first worlde can not be recald nor this our rusty Iron age refinde Since Patience is in starry heau'n instald Let euery Seruitour beare this in minde That howsoeu'r he serue, obserue, deserue if nought but Aire he purchase he may sterue. Sarrire quam seruire satius. 59. [THE BEE.]The attribution of this poem is questionable.

[In Thesaly, ther Asses fine are kept] In Thesaly, ther Asses fine are kept, fayre, smoth, plump, fat and full: The mangers they are fild, y? stables clenly swept And yet their pace is very slow and dull. So sotes oft tymes haue vnto honour crept, when wiser men haue hadd a coulder pull, If Asses haue such luck what shall I say? Let Scollers burne their bookes &amp; goe to play. finis. 61.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [As oft we see before a sudden showre] As oft we see before a sudden showre, The sunne shines hottest &amp; hath greatest powre: Euen so whom fortune meaneth to deride, She liftes a loft, from whence he soone may slide. 62.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Princes be fortunes children, &amp; with them] Princes be fortunes children, &amp; with them she deales as mothers vse their babes to still: Vnto her darlings giues a diadem, A pretie toy their humor to fulfill. And when a little they haue had their will, Looke what she gaue she taketh at her pleasure: Vsinge the rod, when they are out of measure. 63.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Ouer theis brookes, trustinge to ease myne eyes] Ouer theis brookes, trustinge to ease myne eyes, Mine eyes euen great, in laboure with their teares: I layde my face, wherin (alas) ther lies, Clusters of clowdes, w?? no Sunne euer cleeres. In watrie glasse, my watrie eyes I see: Sorrowes ill easd, wher sorrowes paynted be. My thoughtes imprisned in my secret woes, With flamie breastes doe issue oft in sownde: The sownde to this strange ayre no sooner goes, But that it doth with Ecchôs force rebownde. And makes me heare, y? playntes I would refrayne: Thus outward helpes, my inward grifes mayntayne. Now in this sand, I would discharge my mynde, And cast from me, part of my burd'nous cares: But in the sand, my Tales foretold I fynde, And see therin, how well y? writer fares. With streame, ayre, sand, myne eyes &amp; ears conspire: What hope to quench, wher ech thinge blowes y? fire. 64.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Why ?] Why ? When life is my true happinesse disease? My soule, my soule, thy saftie makes me flie The fault is meanes, that might my payne appease. But in my hart her seuerall tormentes dwell. Ah worthlesse witt to traine mee to this woe, Deceiptfull arts that nourish discontent: Ill thriue the follie that bewitcht me so, Vaine though[t]s adieu for now I will repent. And yet my wantes perswade me to proceed, Since none takes pittie one a Scholers need. forgiue me God althought I curse my birth, And ban the ayre wherin I breath a wreatch: Since miserie hath daunted all my mirth, And I am quite vndon through promis[e breach] Oh frendes, no frendes that then vn[kind]ly frowne, When changing fortune casts vs headlong downe. Without redresse complains my carelesse Verse, And Mydas eares relent not at my moane In some farr land will I my griefe rehearse, Mongst them that wilbee mooued when I groane, Ingland adieu the soyle that brought mee forth Adieu vnkinde where skill is no[t]hing worth. 65.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Some m? will saye there is a kynde of muse] Some m? will saye there is a kynde of muse That healps the mynde of eache man to indyte And some will saye (that oft these Muses vse) There are but Nyne that euer vsed to wryte Now of these nyne if I haue hytt on one I muse what Muse 'tis I haue hytt vpon. Some poetes wryte there is a heauenly hyll Wher Pallas keeps: and it Pernassus hyghte There Muses sit for-sothe, and cut the quyll That beinge framde doth hidden fancyes wryte But all these dames diuyne conceyts do synge And all theyr penns be of a phœnix winge. Beleeue me now I neuer sawe the place Vnless in sleepe I drem'de of suche a thynge I neauer vewed fayre Pallas in the face Nor neauer yet could heare the Muses synge Wherby to frame a fancye in her kynde Oh no! my muse is of an other mynde. From Hellicon? no no from Hell she came To wryte of woes and myseryes[:] she hyghte Not Pallas but Alass hir Ladyes name Who neuer calles for dittyes of delyghte. Her pe? is Payne; and all her matter moane And pantynge harts she paynts her mynd vpon. A harte not Harpe is all her instrum?t Whose weakned strynges all out of tune she strayns And than she strikes a dumpe of discontente Tyll euery strynge be pluckt in two with paynes Than in a rage she clapps it vpp in Case: That you maye see her instruments disgrace. Her musick is in su? but sorrowes songe Wher discorde yealds a sound of small delyghte The dittye is: o lyfe that lastes so longe To see desyre thus crossed w?? despyte No faythe on ear??: alas I know no frende! So with a syghe she makes a sole? ende. Vnpleasant is the harmony godd knowes When out of tune is allmost euery strynge The sownde vnsweet, y? all of sorrow growes And sadd the muse, that so is fourced to synge Yet some do synge that else for woe would crye So dothe mye Muse: and so, I sweare, do I. Finis. 66.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Lie downe poore heart and die a while for griefe] Lie downe poore heart and die a while for griefe, Thinke not this world will euer do thee good, Fortune forewarnes ? looke to thy reliefe, And sorrow sucks vpon thy liuing bloud, Then this is all can helpe thee of this hell, Lie downe and die, and then thou shalt doe well. Day giues his light but to thy labours toyle, And night her rest but to thy weary bones, Thy fairest fortune followes with a foyle: And laughing endes but with thine after grones. And this is all can helpe thee of thy hell, Lie downe and die and then thou shalt doe well. Patience doth pine and pitty ease no paine, Time weares the thoughts but nothing helps y? mind, Dead and aliue aliue and dead againe: These are the fits that thou art like to finde. And this is all can helpe thee of thy hell, Lie downe and die and then thou shalt doe well. 67.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Life is a Poets fable] Life is a Poets fable, &amp; al her daies are lies Stolne from deaths reckoning table, For I die as I speake, Death times the notes that I doe breake. Childhood doth die in youth, And youth in old age dies, I thought I liu'd in truth: But I die, now I see, Each age of death makes one degree. Farewell the doting score Of worlds arithmeticke, Life, Ile trust thee no more, Till I die, for thy sake, Ile go by deaths new almanacke. This instant of my song, A thousand men lie sicke, A thousand knels are rong: And I die as I sing, They are but dead and I dying. Death is but lifes decay, Life time, time wastes away, Then reason bids me say, That I die, though my breath Prolongs this space of lingring death. VI Epigrams. 70. Luna.The attribution of this poem is questionable. The moone beeing clouded presently is mist, But litle stars may hide them when they list. Gnattes are unnoted whereso ere they flie But Eagles guarded are with every eye. 71. In fæminæ deformitates.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Though men can cover crime w?? bold sterne lookes, Poore womens faces are their owne faults bookes. 72. In Priamum.The attribution of this poem is questionable.
