      <field name="fulltext">A POEM ON THE PEACE Inscribed to the most Hon??? ROBERT, Earl of Oxford, and Earl Mortimer, Lord High-Treasurer of Great-Britain. —Deus nobis hæc otia fecit. Virg. While no Repulse thy Courage can abate, Or Danger cool thy Zeal to save the State; By Heav'n inspir'd, thy Councils Heav'n must please, Nor are they longer Councils, but Decrees. For this glad Day each grateful Briton bows, And rescu'd Europe pays her thankful Vows. If for each Life preserv'd, as Rome decreed, A Civick Crown were the Preservers Meed, Not Albion's Oaks, tho' stript of all their Boughs, Can furnish Garlands to adorn thy Brows. Disdain not now what Atticus embrac'd, Great Scipio cherish'd, and Augustus grac'd. The Muse in ev'ry Age the Vertuous prize, The Muse, Companion to the Great and Wise. Tho' Princes Honours grant, and Titles give, Those Titles only by her Sanction live; In Brazen Leaves she graves the Hero's Name; Guardian of Honour, Register of Fame. Records destroy'd, and all thy Patents lost, This lasting Page Eternity shall boast. A Potent Faction, turbulent and bold, With undisputed Sway had long Controul'd; The Nation plunder'd to support their State, And bought their Greatness with their Country's Fate. When Britain long with numerous Wrongs opprest, Now saw those Evils which she wish'd Redrest; Her Treasures spent, her Blood like Water spilt, While both so ill employ'd increas'd the Guilt; A long Decay her perish'd Vitals feel, And balmy Peace her Wounds cou'd only heal; Peace she demanded: but her Sons deny'd, And more extorted, as she more supply'd; Against her Honour, and her Rights combin'd In Leagues abroad to both destructive join'd; Some Pow'rs they bought, Themselves to others sold, Brib'd, and were Brib'd again with foreign Gold. Thus private Views destroy'd the Publick Good, And Strangers reap'd the Fruits of British Blood. No Spoils of Ister, Mosa, nor the Sceld, Their Av'rice cloy'd, or Rage of Empire quell'd; Abroad supported, they at Home give Law, Forget their Duty and their Sov'raign Awe; Treat Kingly Pow'r and Heav'n with equal Pride, Who scorns the Gift, the Giver will deride. They both alike unnecessary deem'd, For never yet was Rebel, but Blasphem'd. This Harley saw, and touch'd with gen'rous Grief, Flew to his Country's, and his QUEEN's Relief; Their mutual Good pursu'd with steady View, And on his Head the Faction's Vengeance drew. Long, like a Rock, unmov'd the Patriot stood, And bravely stem'd the strong impetuous Flood Till Threats at last and Insolence prevail'd, When black Designs and Subornation fail'd. Him St. John follow'd, proud to be Disgrac'd, With Harcourt join'd, the Gen'rous Cause embrac'd. Harcourt! whose strict Uprightness clears the Land, No Scales were ever held with steadier Hand. Him Factious Senates from his Right displac'd, Conviction brav'd, and Truth her self out-fac'd; Their Guilt was only greater than their Fear, Which stop'd the charming Voice they durst not hear; Tho' mild Commanding, and with Softness strong, While Hybla's Sweets melt on his flowing Tongue. Thus Vertue suffer'd while the Faction sway'd, And all the Good were equally afraid: The Leader's Fate intimidates the rest; So uncontroul'd they Plunder'd and Opprest. But bounteous Heav'n distrest Europa saw, A Prey to Rapine, and the Sword give Law; Her Sons destroy'd, her pop'lous Cities raz'd, Their Altars pillag'd, and their Shrines defac'd. Whole Countries waste, where once ripe Harvests stood, And where Manur'd at all, Manur'd with Blood. Almighty Pow'r felt Pity move his Breast, Bright Raphael call'd, and thus the Charge exprest; Fly, Raphael, fly, and ere it is too late, Preserve the Remnant, and reverse their Fate. Britannia's QUEEN to Tenderness inclin'd, Assumes to France a more pacifick Mind; Let Bourbon know the certain Terms of Peace, And shew the Means to make these Evils cease. The Seraph bows, thro' Æther cuts his way, And leaves the Regions of Eternal Day. And now to gain in mortal Shape access, Borrows thy Person, St. John, and Address; Pleas'd with the goodly Form, so near his own, The Cherub hardly from himself was known; Like Bolingbroke, in all with Joy he flies, Youth, Beauty, Shape, Complexion, Voice, and Eyes; Nor was he injur'd by the bright Disguise. Where, warlike Franks from Sala and the Main, Transplanted settl'd round the Banks of Sein; Versailles aloft her Golden Turrets rears, And like Enchantment the gay Scene appears. Let Fame no more her Syrian Gardens boast; Hesperian Fables here in Truth are lost. Since Earth was blighted, and by Heav'n accurst, This Eden only can approach the first; A new Creation seems in ev'ry part, And vanquish'd Nature is a Slave to Art, Here thirsty Sands with plenteous Springs abound, And naked Rocks with verdant Groves are crown'd; Fictitious Seas feel a dissembl'd Tide, False Pisons murmur, and Euphrates glide. Here in his Losses great the Monarch lay, Like some vast Pile Majestick in Decay, Stretch'd on his Tyrian Beds invited Rest, But gloomy Cares disturb'd his anxious Breast; When thus the Seraphim the Silence broke, And with a graceful Air, like St. John's, spoke. Attend, O Bourbon, and receive thy Doom, From Britain's Queen by Heav'ns Command I come. In Peace let Austria wear his The Emperor, as King of Lombardy, is Crown'd with an Iron Crown. Iron Crown, The trembling Lombard dread his awful Frown. His dear-bought Lands let crafty Savoy keep, And underneath his Alpes in Safety sleep. Her Realms secure let Lusitania hold, And add Brasilian Mines to Tagus Gold. By strong Barriers let Belgia guarded be, And only fear her ancient Foe the Sea; Then lasting Friendship shall your Nations join, And Bourbon be preferr'd to Austria's Line; The Dutch then grateful shall confess, tho' late, The Aid thy Grandsire gave their Infant-State; And France no more her Succours shall repent, Than Britain those the great Eliza' lent. Be this thy Fate: Thus ANNE and Heavn declare, This yielded, ceases the Destructive War: Then harass'd Gaul her fertile Head shall rear, The Sword no longer dread, or Famine fear; His faithful Spaniards Philip shall enjoy, And leave his Crowns to his Asturian Boy. He spoke: The Monarch bow'd his awful Head, Himself collected, and submissive said, Let this be done; Thy QUEEN has triumph'd more Now by her Goodness, than her Arms before; Expecting Nations her Decision wait, Let her Decrees be mine, and Europe's Fate. The Bar's remov'd, a welcome Truce succeeds, And now no more the valiant Briton bleeds. Ambition glutted quits at last the Field, And struggling Nations to be happy, yield; Lo! Factious Men with Blushes now enjoy Fruits of that Peace, they labour'd to destroy; Their Murmurs spent, and all pretence to Blame, No other Passion can remain, but Shame. While Harley's Breast with conscious Virtue glows, His Patience triumphs, and defeats his Foes, Men see that Wisdom they oppos'd so long, And own their Folly to repair the Wrong. Thus, when in Search of Worlds Columbus sail'd, Unmov'd he stood, when meaner Courage fail'd; In Floods unknown new Scenes of Horror rise, New Monsters frighten, and new Storms surprize; Thunders unheard before the Welkin rend, And Clouds intire in dreadful Spouts descend. The heartless Crew surrender to their Fear, No Voice regard, and no Persuasion hear, No Hopes cou'd make, of Empire or of Gold, Th' ambitious brave, or avaricious bold. The gallant Man to Slaves a Suitor stands, While Cowards scarce refrain their impious Hands. But when they saw the promis'd World appear, Their Transport only cou'd exceed their Fear; On the glad Scene they fix'd their ravish'd Eyes, While Seas subside, and growing Mountains rise; Abash'd, confounded, and struck mute with Shame, Each other seem'd with conscious Looks to blame; Their humble Necks with low Obeisance bent, Till gushing Tears give struggling Accents Vent; Then suppliant all the God-like Man implore, And worship now whom they outrag'd before. Hark! the glad News arrives, Men cease to Pray, And to Thanksgiving turn the mournful Good-Friday, on which Day the News of the Peace arriv'd. Day, With Nitre fill'd, Hark! the loud Engines roar, And tell the Joy to ev'ry distant Shore; Sulphureous Flames borne on the Wings of Air, In Heav'n's own Voice, the Gift of Heav'n declare. Transported Thames, exulting as he runs, Imparts the Bliss to all his Nymphs and Sons, Twede, oft distain'd with Pict and Saxon Blood, The Trent and Ouse both lost in Humber's Flood, The Avon famous for his Tyrian Dye, The rapid Severne and the gentler Wye, Of Western Nymphs the most renown'd by Fame, And beauteous Vaga was her ancient Name, To Merlin known; oft on her Banks he walk'd When with his Genii and his Gods he talk'd; Oft in her Springs he bath'd, with Visions fir'd, And with prophetick Rage her Breast inspir'd. With Joy she now revolves her ancient Dreams, And summons all her tributary Streams; The Cambrian Nymphs around the Call obey, And wonted Homage to the Goddess pay. When thus she spoke: Ye lov'd Silurian Swains, Ye Fauns, and Nymphs that haunt these flow'ry Plains, Attend my Voice; next Anne, and bounteous Heav'n, My Son, my Harley has this Blessing giv'n; Harley! who now succeeds that ancient Race, Who wore their Honours by Matilda's Grace; Fate opens now a more extended Scene, A greater Subject, and a greater QUEEN; A longer Race of Heroes shall be told, To wear the George, and dignify the Gold, While Veres extinct no longer shall repine, Since thus succeeded by their Kindred Line. His Conduct former Errors has redrest; His Dangers Safety give, his Labours Rest. Torn from the Plough by Ruffian hands no more, The peaceful Hind shall quit his native shore, Behind him leave the Comforts of his Life, His helpless Infants, and his tender Wife: Britons no more like Slaves be bought and sold, To daub their Leaders shining Vests with Gold. But now those hands accustom'd to destroy, The Arts of Peace in useful Works employ. The pious Senate has new Temples giv'n, And the first Debt they paid, was paid to Heav'n: The Spade succeeds the Sword; the vig'rous Swains New Quarries ope', and rend their flinty Veins; The stony Portland sends her massy Blocks, For us Liguria cuts her Marble Rocks. See the round Domes, and Cones that touch the Skies, While in their Orders rang'd the Columns rise; The sturdy Tuscan with a rustick Grace, And artless Pomp, leans on his massy Base; The graceful Dorick with a manly Pride, The neat Ionick deck'd like modest Bribe, Reveals the Beauties, which she seems to hide. The gay Corinthian next, whose wanton Dress And Lais Air the Courtezan confess; The Compound various, and by each exprest, Together blends the Beauties of the rest. Now duly pois'd, o'er-hangs the well-arch'd Vault, With bold Relieve, and rich Mosaick wrought, To make the Marble breath, and Colours live, At once the Chissel and the Pencil strive. Here suppliant Crouds for ANNA Heav'n invoke, For ANNA's Life the new-rais'd Altars smoak, The Merchant now shall sail with every Breeze, And fear no Dangers, but from Winds and Seas. His yearly Fleets Silurian Harley sends, And unknown Nations makes Britannia's Friends. Lo! to the Torrid Zone they joyful ply, Leave Fogs behind, and meet a brighter Sky; See o'er their Heads new Constellations shine, And void of Shadows, pass the Burning Line; Where Phœbus Darts direct his pointed Ray, And Night in equal Ballance holds with Day. Thence to the Pole Antartick slowly bend, Behold the Crosier rise, and Bear descend. Now pass the Streights by the Castilian found, Nor more by him than our Great Drake renown'd, Drake, the Successor of his Course and Fame, To Britain justly gave the second Claim. And now our Oaks in the Pacifick Tide, With pointed Prows the lazy Waves divide; Chilese no more for fear their Dwellings leave, But ancient Foes, like welcome Friends receive; In Songs their Olive Nymphs sound ANNA's Fame, And Andes' Rocks repeat the glorious Name. Nor is our Traffick bound to Southern Shores, The skilful Briton unknown Seas explores; To India cuts a more compendious way, Pursues the Sun, and overtakes the Day. Now spicy Isles no more shall useless be, Where Britons come, all like themselves are Free. One Nation's Av'rice shall no more The Dutch, in the East-Indies, after they have got their own Cargo, send Soldiers to destroy the Spice, that other Nations may not gather it. Destroy (Least others reap) what they cannot Enjoy. See the glad Sailor range those happy Seas, And ev'ry Sense with grateful Objects please; While from each Rock a fragrant breath exhales, And Eurus fans with aromatick Gales; While balmy Winds in his swell'd Canvas play, Without the Magnet steer, and swell the Way To Banda, Ternate, and the green Tidore, Amboyna purple still with English Gore; The fruitful Isle for fragrant Bark esteem'd The modern Ceylon, ancient Ophir deem'd. Arriv'd, with Joy he strips the blooming Groves, Rakes spicy Heaps, and piles the budding Cloves; The racy Root, and the ambrosial Rind, The musky Nut in macy Husk enshrin'd. While Fruits delicious, and salubrious Air, His Strength recover, and his Health repair, His Limbs no more scorbutick Pains endure, At once he finds his Profit and his Cure. Thence to the Realms the yellow Ganges laves, And purer Indus with his sacred Waves; Where in their Beds the fluid Gellies lie, Till Phœbus hardens and imparts the Dye. Here Monarchs high on Thrones, ador'd like Gods, While bowing Nations wait their dreadful Nods, Of Britain's QUEEN with Awe and Pleasure hear, Her Thunder dread, and Majesty revere; Her Right o'er Seas by humble Tribute own, And send their Jewels to adorn her Throne. While rolling Orbs their Revolutions keep, Tides flowing swell, and ebbing sink the Deep. While Cynthia silent Arbitress of Night Shall Monthly lose, and Monthly gain her Light. While Leaden Saturn his slow Course shall run, And deck'd with radiant Ring creep round the Sun. Round Golden Jove while various Moons shall wheel, Alternate hide, and then their Beams reveal. While unattended Mars is doom'd to Night, Without the Aid of any borrow'd Light. While Earth diurnal on her Ax shall roll, And slow Bootes guard the Artick Pole. While Venus setting shall the West adorn, And rising chase the Stars and lead the Morn, Now Golden seem, then take a paler Hue, And Cynthia-like, her waning Horns renew. While scorch'd Mercurius feels eternal Steams, And hides his glowing Disc in Phœbus Beams, To distant Worlds shall ANNA's Fame be known, And Banquo's Race possess the British Throne. But if, thro' doom of unrelenting Fate, She, like to Gods, must yet have mortal Date, Slow may the Sands of ebbing Life be spent, When Heav'n resumes, what Heav'n has only lent; May both, ye Pow'rs, of Time one Period know, ANNE cease to breath, and Vaga cease to flow. Thus far the Muse without Ambition sings, And skims the Shore to save her waxen Wings; Some nobler Genius with a Voice sublime, Must dauntless fathom the dark Depths of Time; Some bolder Muse the vast Abyss explore, The God restrains, and we can sing no more. Thou, Granville, only can'st this Province fill, In thee is Nature, what in others Skill; Lov'd Son of Phœbus, touch the trembling Lyre, The Sisters all attend to fill the Quire: Thou only equal can'st the Task sustain, Immortal ANNE, and Her immortal Reign.
