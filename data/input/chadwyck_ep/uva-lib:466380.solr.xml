      <field name="fulltext">Vol. I. The Odoherty Papers [MEMOIR OF MORGAN ODOHERTY] [If a lover, sweet creature, should foolishly seek] If a lover, sweet creature, should foolishly seek On thy face for the bloom of the rose, Oh tell him, although it has died on thy cheek, He will find it at least on thy nose. Sweet emblem of virtue! rely upon this, Should thy bosom be wantonly prest, That if the rude ravisher gets but a kiss, He'll be ready to fancy the rest! [Ah, 'tis a weary night! Alas, will sleep] Euphemia. Ah, 'tis a weary night! Alas, will sleep Ne'er darken my poor day-lights! I have watched The stars all rise and disappear again; Capricorn, Orion, Venus, and the Bear: I saw them each and all. And they are gone, Yet not a wink for me. The blessed Moon Has journeyed through the sky: I saw her rise Above the distant hills, and gloriously Decline beneath the waters. My poor head aches Beyond endurance. I'll call on Beatrice, And bid her bring me the all-potent draught Left by Fernando the apothecary, At his last visit. Beatrice! She sleeps As sound as a top. What, ho, Beatrice! Thou art indeed the laziest waiting maid That ever cursed a princess. Beatrice! Beatrice. Coming, your highness; give me time to throw My night-gown o'er my shoulders, and to put My flannel dicky on; 'tis mighty cold At these hours of the morning. Euphem. Beatrice. Beat. I'm groping for my slippers; would you have me Walk barefoot o'er the floors? Lord, I should catch My death of cold. Euphem. And must thy mistress, then, I say, must she Endure the tortures of the damned, whilst thou Art groping for thy slippers! Selfish wretch! Learn, thou shalt come stark-naked at my bidding, Or else pack up thy duds and hop the twig. Beat. Oh, my lady, forgive me that I was so slow In yielding due obedience. Pray, believe me, It ne'er shall happen again. Oh, it would break My very heart to leave so beautiful And kind a mistress. Oh, forgive me! Euphem. Well, well; I fear I was too hasty: But want of sleep, and the fever of my blood, Have soured my natural temper. Bring me the phial Of physic left by that skilful leech Fernando, With Laudanum on the label. It stands Upon the dressing-table, close by the rouge And the Olympian dew. No words. Evaporate. Beat. [exit. I fly! Euphem. (sola.) Alas, Don Carlos, mine own Dear wedded husband! wedded! yes; wedded In th' eye of Heaven, though not in that of man, Which sees the forms of things, but least knows That which is in the heart. Oh, can it be, That some dull words, muttered by a parson In a long drawling tone, can make a wife, And not the— Enter Beatrice. Beat. Laudanum on the label; right: Here, my lady, is the physic you require. Euphem. Then pour me out one hundred drops and fifty, With water in the glass, that I may quaff Oblivion to my misery. Beat. 'Tis done. Euphem. (drinks.) My head turns round; it mounts into my brain. I feel as if in paradise! My senses mock me: Methinks I rest within thine arms, Don Carlos; Can it be real? Pray, repeat that kiss! I am thine own Euphemia. This is bliss Too great for utterance. Oh, ye gods If Hellespont and Greece! Alas, I faint. [faints. [Oh, lady, in the laughing hours] Oh, lady, in the laughing hours, When time and joy go hand in hand; When pleasure strews thy path with flowers, And but to wish is to command; When thousands swear, that to thy lips A more than angel's voice is given, And that thy jetty eyes eclipse The bright, the blessed stars of heaven; Might it not cast a trembling shade Across the light of mirth and song, To think that there is one, sweet maid, That loved thee hopelessly and long; That loved, yet never told his flame, Although it burned his soul to madness; That lov'd, yet never breathed thy name, Even in his fondest dreams of gladness. Though red my coat, yet pale my face, Alas, 'tis love that made it so, Thou only canst restore its grace, And bid its wonted blush to glow. Restore its blush! oh, I am wrong, For here thine art were all in vain; My face has ceased to blush so long, I fear it ne'er can blush again! [Captain Godolphin was a very odd and stingy man] Captain Godolphin was a very odd and stingy man, Whose skipper was, as I'm assur'd, of a schooner-rigg'd West Indiaman; The wind was fair, he went on board, and when he sail'd from Dover, Says he, “this trip is but a joke, for now I'm half seas over!” The captain's wife, she sail'd with him, this circumstance I heard of her, Her brimstone breath, 'twas almost death to come within a yard of her; With fiery nose, as red as rose, to tell no lies I'll stoop, She looked just like an admiral with a lantern at his poop. Her spirits sunk from eating junk, and as she was an epicure, She swore a dish of dolphin fish would of her make a happy cure. The captain's line, so strong and fine, had hooked a fish one day, When his anxious wife Godolphin cried, and the dolphin swam away. The wind was foul, the weather hot, between the tropics long she stewed, The latitude was 5 or 6, 'bout 50 was the longitude, When Jack the cook once spoilt the sauce, she thought it mighty odd, But her husband bawl'd on deck, why, here's the Saucy Jack, A celebrated American privateer. by God. The captain sought his charming wife, and whispered to her private ear, “My love, this night we'll have to fight a thumping Yankee privateer.” On this he took a glass of rum, by which he showed his sense; Resolved that he would make at least a spirited defence. The captain of the Saucy Jack, he was a dark and dingy man; Says he, “my ship must take, this trip, this schooner-rigg'd West Indianman. Each at his gun, we'll show them fun, the decks are all in order: But mind that every lodger here, must likewise be a boarder.” No, never was there warmer work, at least I rather think not, With cannon, cutlass, grappling-iron, blunderbuss, and stink-pot. The Yankee captain, boarding her, cried, either strike or drown; Godolphin answered, “then I strike,” and quickly knocked him down. [Great king of the ocean, transcendent and grand] Great king of the ocean, transcendent and grand Dost thou rest 'mid the waters so blue; So vast is thy form, I am sure, on dry land, It would cover an acre or two. Thou watery Colossus, how lovely the sight, When thou sailest majestic and slow, And the sky and the ocean together unite Their splendor around thee to throw. Or near to the pole, 'mid the elements' strife, Where the tempest the seaman appals, Unmoved, like a Continent pregnant with life, Or rather a living St. Paul's. Thee soon as the Greenlander fisherman sees, He plans thy destruction, odd rot him; And often, before thou hast time to cry pease, He has whipped his harpoon in thy bottom. [“Confusion seize your lowsy sowl, ye nasty dirty varment] “Confusion seize your lowsy sowl, ye nasty dirty varment, Ye goes your ways, and leaves me here without the least preferment; When you've drunk my gin, and robbed my till, and stolen all my pelf, ye Sail away, and think no more on your wife at Philadelphy.” [Have you sailed on the breast of the deep] Have you sailed on the breast of the deep, When the winds had all silenced their breath, And the waters were hushed in as holy a sleep, And as calm, as the slumber of death. When the yellow moon beaming on high, Shone tranquilly bright on the wave, And careered through the vast and impalpable sky, Till she found in the ocean a grave, And dying away by degrees on the sight, The waters were clad in the mantle of night. 'Twould impart a delight to thy soul, As I felt it imparted to mine, And the draught of affliction that blackened my bowl Grew bright as the silvery brine. I carelessly lay on the deck, And listened in silence to catch The wonderful stories of battle or wreck That were told by the men of the watch. Sad stories of demons most deadly that be, And of mermaids that rose from the depths of the sea. Strange visions my fancy had filled, I was wet with the dews of the night; And I thought that the moon still continued to gild The wave with a silvery light. I sunk by degrees into sleep, I thought of my friends who were far, When a form seemed to glide o'er the face of the deep, As bright as the evening star, Ne'er rose there a spirit more lovely and fair, Yet I trembled to think that a spirit was there. Emerald green was her hair, Braided with gems of the sea, Her arm, like a meteor, she waved in the air, And I knew that she beckoned on me. She glanced upon me with her eyes, How ineffably bright was their blaze; I shrunk and I trembled with fear and surprise, Yet still I continued to gaze; But enchantingly sweet was the smile of her lip, And I followed the vision and sprang from the ship. 'Mid the waves of the ocean I fell, The dolphins were sporting around, And many a triton was tuning the shell, And extatic and wild was the sound; There were thousands of fathoms above, And thousands of fathoms below; And we sunk to the caves where the sea lions rove, And the topaz and emerald glow, Where the diamond and sapphire eternally shed, Their lustre around on the bones of the dead. And well might their lustre be bright, For they shone on the limbs of the brave, Of those who had fought in the terrible fight, And were buried at last in the wave. In grottoes of coral they slept, On white beds of pearl around; And near them for ever the water snake crept, And the sea lion guarded the ground, While the dirge of the heroes by spirits was rung, And solemn and wild were the strains that they sung. Dirge. Sweet is the slumber the mariners sleep, Their bones are laid in the caves of the deep, Far over their heads the tempests sweep, That ne'er shall wake them more; They died when raved the bloody fight, And loud was the cannon's roar; Their death was dark, their glory bright, And they sunk to rise no more, They sunk to rise no more. But the loud wind past, When they breathed their last, And it carried their dying sigh In a winding-sheet, With a shot at their feet, In coral caves they lie, In coral caves they lie. Or where the syren of the rocks Lovely waves her sea-green locks, Where the deadly breakers foam, Found they an eternal home. Horrid and long were the struggles of death, Black was the night when they yielded their breath, But not on the ocean, all buoyant and bloated, The sport of the waters their white bodies floated, For they were borne to coral caves, Distant far beneath the waves, And there on beds of pearl they sleep, And far over their heads the tempests sweep, That ne'er shall wake them more, That ne'er shall wake them more. [Come, push round the bottle; one glass ere we part] Come, push round the bottle; one glass ere we part Must in sadness go round to the friends of my heart, With whom many a bright hour of joy has gone by, Whom with pleasure I met, whom I leave with a sigh. Yes, the hours have gone by; like a bright sunny gleam, In the dark sky of winter, they fled like a dream; Yet when years shall have cast their dim shadows between, I shall fondly remember the days that have been. Come, push round the bottle; for ne'er shall the chain That has bound us together be broken in twain, And I'll drink, wheresoever my lot may be cast, To the friends that I love, and the days that are past. [Let Dandies to M'Culloch go] Let Dandies to M'Culloch go, And Ministers to Fortune's hall; For Indians Oman's claret flow, In John M'Phails let lawyers crow, These places seem to me so so, I love Bill Young's above them all. One only rival, honest Bill, Hast thou in Morgan's whim; I mean Ben Waters, charming Ben, Simplest and stupidest of men; I take a tankard now and then, And smoke a pipe with him. Dear Ben! dear Bill! I love you both, Between you oft my fancy wavers; Thou, Bill, excell'st in sheepshead broth; Thy porter-mugs are crowned with froth; At Young's I listen, nothing loth, To my dear Dilettanti shavers. O scene of merriment and havers, Of good rum-punch, and puns, and clavers, And warbling sweet Elysian quavers!— Who loves not Young's must be a Goth. [While worldly men through stupid years] While worldly men through stupid years Without emotion jog, Devoid of passions, hopes, and fears, As senseless as a log— I much prefer my nights to spend, A happy ranting dog, And see dull care his front unbend Before the smile of Hogg. The life of man's a season drear, Immersed in mist and fog, Until the star of wit appear, And set its clouds agog. For me, I wish no brighter sky Than o'er a jug of grog, When fancy kindles in the eye, The good gray eye of Hogg. When Misery's car is at its speed, The glowing wheels to cog; To make the heart where sorrows bleed Leap lightly like a frog; Gay verdure o'er the crag to shower, And blossoms o'er the bog, Wit's potent magic has the power, When thou dost wield it, Hogg! [O hone, Odoherty!] O hone, Odoherty! I canna weel tell what is wrang; But oh, man, since you gaed frae me, The days are unco dull and lang. I try the paper and the sclate, And pen, and cawk, and killivine; But nothing can I write of late, That even Girzzy ca's divine. O hone, Odoherty! O hone, Odoherty! Oh weary fa' the fates' decree, That garred the Captain part frae me. O hone, Odoherty! Come back, come back to Ettrick lake, And ye sall hear, and ye sall see, What I'se do for the Captain's sake. I'll coff tobacco o' the best, And pipes baith lang and short I'se gie; And the toddy-stoup sall ne'er get rest, Frae morn till night, 'tween you and me. O hone, Odoherty! O hone, Odoherty! O welcome sall the moment be That brings the Captain back to me. [When wondering ages shall have rolled away] When wondering ages shall have rolled away, And that be ancient which is new to-day; When time has pour'd his warm and softening glow O'er that pale virgin's throbbing breast of snow, And lent the settled majesty of years To those grim Spahis, and those proud viziers; From distant lands the ardent youth shall come To gaze with admiration—breathless—dumb— To fix his eyes, like orbs of marble, there! And let his soul luxuriate in despair. Posterity! ah, what's a name to thee! What Raphael is, my Allan then shall be. ELEGY WRITTEN IN A BALL-ROOM. The beaux are jogging on the pictured floor, The belles responsive trip with lightsome heels; While I, deserted, the cold pangs deplore, Or breathe the wrath which slighted beauty feels. When first I entered glad, with glad mamma, The girls were ranged and clustered round us then; Few beaux were there, those few with scorn I saw, Unknowing Dandies that could come at ten. My buoyant heart beat high with promised pleasure, My dancing garland moved with airy grace; Quick beat my active toe to Gow's gay measure, And undissembled triumph wreathed my face. Fancy prospective took a proud survey Of all the coming glories of the night; Even where I stood my legs began to play— So racers paw the turf e'er jockeys smite. And “who shall be my partner first?” I said, As my thoughts glided o'er the coming beaux; “Not Tom, nor Ned, nor Jack,”—I tossed my head, Nice grew my taste, and high my scorn arose. “If Dicky asks me, I shall spit and sprain; When Sam approaches, headaches I will mention; I'll freeze the colonel's heart with cold disdain;” Thus cruelly ran on my glib invention. While yet my fancy revelled in her dreams, The sets are forming, and the fiddles scraping; Gow's wakening chord a stirring prelude screams, The beaux are quizzing, and the misses gaping. Beau after beau approaches, bows, and smiles, Quick to the dangler's arm springs glad ma'amselle; Pair after pair augments the sparkling files, And full upon my ear “the triumph” swells. I flirt my fan in time with the mad fiddle, My eye pursues the dancers' motions flying; Cross hands! Balancez! down and up the middle! To join the revel how my heart is dying. One miss sits down all glowing from the dance, Another rises, and another yet; Beaux upon belles, and belles on beaux advance, The tune unending, ever full the set. At last a pause there comes—to Gow's keen hand The hurrying lackey hands the enlivening port; The misses sip the ices where they stand, And gather vigor to renew the sport. I round the room dispense a wistful glance, Wish Ned, or Dick, or Tom, would crave the honor; I hear Sam whisper to Miss B., “Do—dance,” And launch a withering scowl of envy on her. Sir Billy capers up to Lady Di; In vain I cough as gay Sir Billy passes; The Major asks my sister—faint I sigh, “Well after this—the men are grown such asses!” In vain! in vain! again the dancers mingle, With lazy eye I watch the busy scene, Far on the pillowed sofa sad and single, Languid the attitude—but sharp the spleen. “La! ma'am, how hot!”—“You're quite fatigued, I see;” “What a long dance!”—“And so you're come to town!” Such casual whispers are addressed to me, But not one hint to lead the next set down. The third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, are gone, And now the seventh—and yet I'm asked not once When supper comes must I descend alone? Does Fate deny me my last prayer—a dunce? Mamma supports me to the room for munching, There turkey's breast she crams, and wing of pullet; I slobbering jelly, and hard nuts am crunching, And pouring tuns of trifle down my gullet. No beau invites me to a glass of sherry; Above me stops the salver of champaign; While all the rest are tossing brimmers merry, I with cold water comfort my disdain. Ye bucks of Edinburgh! ye tasteless creatures! Ye vapid Dandies! how I scorn you all!— Green slender slips, with pale cheese-pairing features, And awkward, lumb'ring, red-faced boobies tall. Strange compounds of the beau and the attorney! Raw lairds! and school-boys for a whisker shaving! May injured beauty's glance of fury burn ye! I hate you—clowns and fools!—but hah!—I'm raving! [There was a time when every sort of people] There was a time when every sort of people Created, relished, and commended jokes; But now a joker's stared at, like a steeple, By the majority of Christian folks. Dulness has tanned her hide to thickness triple, And Observation sets one in the stocks, When you've been known a comic song to sing, Write notices, or any harmless thing. This Edinburgh, Edina, or Dunedin— ('Cleped, in the Bailie's lingo, “the Good Town;” But styled “Auld Reekie” by all Celts now treading Her streets, bows, winds, lanes, crescents, up and down, Her labyrinths of stairs and closes threading On other people's business or their own— Those bandy, broad-faced, rough-kneed, ragged laddies— Those horney-fisted, those gill-swigging caddies.) This Edinburgh some call Metropolis, And Capital, and Athens of the North— I know not what they mean.—I'm sure of this,— Tho' she abounds in men of sense and worth, Her staple and predominant qualities Are ignorance, and nonsense, and so forth; I don't like making use of a hard word, But 'tis the merest hum I ever heard. There's our Mackenzie; all with veneration See him that Harley felt and Caustic drew: There's Scott, the pride and darling of his nation, Poet and cavalier, kind, generous, true. There's Jeffrey, who has been the botheration Of the whole world with his glib sharp Review, And made most young Scots lawyers mad with whiggery— There's Leslie, Stewart, Alison, and Gregory. But these and some few others being named, I don't remember one more great gun in her; The remanent population can't be blamed, Because their chief concern in life's their dinner. To give examples I should be ashamed, And people would cry, “Lord! that wicked sinner!” (For all we gentry here are quite egg-shells, We can't endure jokes that comes near “oor-sells.”) They say that knowledge is diffused and general, And taste and understanding are so common, I'd rather see a sweep-boy suck a penny roll Than listen to a criticising woman. And as for poetry, the time of dinner all, Thank God, I then have better things to do, man.— Exceptions 'gainst the fair were coarse and shocking— I've seen in breeches many a true blue stocking. Blue stocking stands, in my vocabulary, For one that always chatters (sex is nothing) About new books from June to January, And with re-echoed carpings moves your loathing I like to see young people smart and airy, With well dressed hair and fashionable clothing, Can't they discourse about ball, rout, or play, And know reviewing's quite out of their way? It strikes me as a thing exceeding stupid, This conversation about books, books, books, When I was young, and sat midst damsels grouped, I talked of roses, zephyrs, gurgling brooks, Venus, the Graces, Dian, Hymen, Cupid, Perilous glances, soul ubduing looks, Slim tapering fingers, glossy clustering curls, Diamonds and emeralds, cairngorms and pearls. On Una that made sunshine in the shade, And Emily with eye of liquid jet, And gentle Desdemona, and the maid That sleeps within the tomb of Capulet Hearts love to ponder—would it not degrade Our notion of a nymph like Juliet, To be informed that she had just read thro' Last Number of the Edinburgh Review? Leave ye to dominies and sticker stibblers, And all the sedentary generation, The endless chitter-chatter about scribblers, And England's melancholy situation. Let them be still the customary nibblers Of all that rule or edify the nation; Leave off the corn-bill, and the law of libel, And read the Pilgrim's Progress or your Bible. [I rose this morning about half past nine] I rose this morning about half past nine, At breakfast coffee I consumed pour quatre, Unnumbered rolls enriched with marmalade fine, And little balls of butter dished in water, Three eggs, two plateful of superb cold chine (Much recommended to make thin folks fatter); And having thus my ballast stow'd on board, Roamed forth to kill a day's time like a lord. How I contrived to pass the whole forenoon, I can't remember though my life were on it; I helped G. T. in jotting of a tune, And hinted rhymes to G?s for a sonnet; Called at the Knox's shop with Miss Balloon And heard her ipsa dixit on a bonnet; Then washed my mouth with ices, tarts, and flummeries, And ginger-beer and soda, at Montgomery's. Down Prince's Street I once or twice paraded, And gazed upon these same eternal faces; Those beardless beaux and bearded belles, those faded And flashy silks, surtouts, pelisses, laces, Those crowds of clerks, astride on hackneys jaded, Prancing and capering with notorial grace; Dreaming enthusiasts who indulge vain whimsies, That they might pass in Bond Street or St. James's. I saw equestrian and pedestrian vanish —One to a herring in his lonely shop. And some of kind gregarious, and more clanish, To club at Waters' for a mutton-chop; Myself resolved for once my cares to banish, And give the Cerberus of thought a sop, Got Jack's, and Sam's, and Dick's, and Tom's consent, And o'er the Mound to Billy Young's we went. I am not nice, I care not what I dine on, A sheep's head or beef-steak is all I wish; Old Homer! how he loved the ??????? ????? It is the glass that glorifies the dish. The thing that I have always set my mind on (A small foundation laid of fowl, flesh, fish) Is out of bottle, pitcher, or punch-bowl, To suck reviving solace to my soul. Life's a dull dusty desert, waste and drear, With now and then an oasis between, Where palm-trees rise, and fountains gushing clear Burst neath the shelter of that leafy screen; Haste not your parting steps, when such appear, Repose, ye weary travellers, on the green. Horace and Milton, Dante, Burns, and Schiller, Dined at a tavern—when they had “the siller.” And ne'er did poet, epical or tragical, At Florence, London, Weimar, Rome, Maybole, See time's dark lanthern glow with hues more magical Than I have witnessed in the Coffin-hole. Praise of antiquity a bam and fudge I call, Ne'er past the present let my wishes roll; A fig for all comparing, croaking grumblers, Hear me, dear dimpling Billy, bring the tumblers. Let blank verse hero, or Spenserian rhymer, Treat Donna Musa with chateau-margout, Chateau-la-fitte, Johannisberg, Hocheimer, In tall outlandish glasses green and blue, Thanks to my stars, myself, a doggrel-chimer, Have nothing with such costly tastes to do; My muse is always kindest when I court her O'er whiskey-punch, gin-twist, strong beer, and porter. And O, my pipe, though in these Dandy days Few love thee, fewer still their love confess, Ne'er let me blush to celebrate thy praise, Divine invention of the age of Bess! I for a moment interrupt my lays The tiny tube with loving lip to press, I'll then come back with a reviving zest, And give thee three more stanzas of my best. (I smoke.) Pipe! whether plain in fashion of Frey-herr, Or gaudy glittering in the taste of Boor, Deep-darkened Meer-shaum or Ecume-de-mer, Or snowy clay of Gowda, light and pure. Let different people different pipes prefer, Delft, horn, or catgut, long, short, older, newer, Puff, every brother, as it likes him best, De gustibus non disputandum est. Pipe! when I stuff into thee my canaster, With flower of camomile and leaf of rose, And the calm rising fume comes fast and faster, Curling with balmy circles near my nose, And all the while my dexter hand is master Of the full cup from Meux's vat that flows, Heavens! all my brain a soft oblivion wraps Of wafered letters and of single taps. I've no objections to a good segar, A true Havana, smooth, and moist, and brown; But then the smoke's too near the eye by far, And out of doors 'tis in a twinkling flown; And somehow it sets all my teeth ajar, When to an inch or so we've smoked him down; And if your leaf have got a straw within it, You know 'tis like a cinder in a minute. I have no doubt a long excursive hooker Suits well some lordly lounger of Bengal, Who never writes, or looks into a book, or Does any thing with earnestness at all; He sits, and his tobacco's in the nook, or Tended by some black heathen in the hall, Lays up his legs, and thinks he does great things If once in the half hour a puff he brings. I rather follow in my smoking trim The example of Scots cottars and their wives Who, while the evening air is warm and dim, In July sit beside their garden hives; And, gazing all the while with wrinkles grim To see how the concern of honey thrives, Empty before they've done a four-ounce bag Of sailors' twist, or, what's less common—shag. SONG I. Confusion to routs and at homes, To assemblies, and balls, and what not; 'Tis with pain e'er Odoherty roams From the scenes of the pipe and the pot. Your Dandies may call him a sot, They never can call him a spoon; And Odoherty cares not a jot, For he's sure you won't join in the tune. With your pipes and your swipes, And your herrings and tripes, You never can join in the tune. I'm a swapper, as every one knows, In my pumps six feet three inches high; 'Tis no wonder your minikin beaux Have a fancy to fight rather shy Of a Gulliver chap such as I, That could stride over troops of their tribes, That had never occasion to buy Either collars, or calves, or kibes. My boot wrenches and pinches, Though 'tis wide twenty inches, And I don't bear my brass at my kibes. When I see a fantastical hopper, A trim little chip of the ton, Not so thick as your Highness' pipe-stopper, And scarcely, I take it, so long, Swaddled prim and precise as a prong, With his ribs running all down and up, Says I, Does the creature belong To the race of the ewe or the tup? With their patches and their scratches, And their plastered mustaches, They are more of the ewe than the tup. SONG II. That nothing is perfect has frequently been By the wisest philosophers stated untruly; Which only can prove that they never had seen The agreeable Lady Lucretia Gilhooly. Where's the philosopher would not feel loss of her? Whose bosom these bright sunny eyes would not thaw? Although I'm a game one, these little highwaymen Have rifled the heart of poor Major M'Craw. Cook sail'd round the world, and Commodore Anson The wonders he met with has noted down duly; But Cook, nor yet Anson, could e'er light by chance on A beauty like Lady Lucretia Gilhooly. Let astronomer asses still peep through their glasses, Then tell all the stars and the planets they saw; Damn Georgium Sidus! We've Venus beside us, And that is sufficient for Major M'Craw. THE ENGLISH SAILOR AND THE KING OF ACHEN'S DAUGHTER. A Tale of Terror. This imitation of Monk Lewis's “Tales of Wonder,” and of part of Coleridge's “Ancient Mariner,” has something of the flavor of the quaint ballad, called “As I sailed, as I sailed,” in which are recorded the piratical deeds and pendulous exit of Captain Kyd.—M. Come, listen Gentles all, And Ladies unto me, And you shall be told of a Sailor bold As ever sail'd on Sea. 'Twas in the month of May, Sixteen hundred sixty and four, We sallied out, both fresh and stout, In the good ship Swift-sure. With wind and weather fair We sail'd from Plymouth Sound, And the Line we crossed, and the Cape we pass'd, Being to China bound. And we sail'd by Sunda Isles, And Ternate and Tydore, Till the wind it lagg'd, and our sails they flagg'd, In sight of Achen's shore. Becalm'd, days three times three, We lay in th' burning sun; Our Water we drank, and our Meat it stank, And our Biscuits were well nigh done. Oh! then 'twas an awful sight Our Seamen for to behold, Who t'other day were so fresh and gay, And their hearts as stout as gold. But now our hands they shook, And our cheeks were yellow and lean— Our faces all long, and our nerves unstrung, And loose and squalid our skin. And we walk'd up and down the deck As long as our legs could bear us; And we thirsted all, but no rain would fall, And no dews arise to cheer us. But the red red Sun from the sky Lent his scorching beams all day, Till our tongues, through drought, hung out of our mouth, And we had no voice to pray. And the hot hot air from the South Did lie on our lungs all night As if the grim Devil, with his mouth full of evil, Had blown on our troubled Sprite. At last, so it happ'd one night, When we all in our hammocks lay, Bereft of breath, and expecting death To come ere break of day. On a sudden a cooling breeze Shook the hammock where I was lain; And then, by Heaven's grace, I felt on my face A drop of blessed rain. I open'd my half-closed eyes, And my mouth I open'd it wide And I started with joy, from my hammock so high, And “A breeze, a breeze!” I cried. But no man heard me cry, And the breeze again fell down; And a clap of Thunder, with fear and wonder Nigh cast me in a swound. I dared not look around, Till, by degrees grown bolder, I saw a grim sprite, by the moon's pale light, Dim glimmering at my shoulder. He was drest in a Seamen's jacket, Wet trowsers, and dripping hose, And an unfelt wind, I heard behind, That whistled among his clothes. I look'd at him by the light of the stars, I look'd by the light of the moon, And I saw, though his face was cover'd with scars, John Jewkes, my Sister's Son. “Alas! John Jewkes,” I cried, “Poor boy, what brings thee here?” But nothing he said, but hung down his head, And made his bare scull appear. Then I, by my grief grown bold, To take his hand endeavor'd, But his head he turned round, which a gaping wound Had nigh from his shoulders sever'd. He opened his mouth to speak, Like a man with his last breath struggling, And, before every word, in his throat was heard A horrible misguggling. At last, with a broken groan, He gurgled, “Approach not me! For the Fish have my head, and the Indians my blood, 'Tis only my Ghost you see. “And dost thou not remember, Three years ago to-day, How at Aunt's we tarried, when Sister was married To Farmer Robin, pray? “Oh! then we were blythe and jolly, But none of us all had seen, While we sung and we laugh'd, and the stout ale quaff'd, That our number was thirteen. “And none of all the party, At the head of the table, saw, While our cares we drown'd, and the flagon went round, Old Goody Martha Daw. “But Martha she was there, Though she never spake a word; And by her sat her old black cat, Though it never cried or purr'd. “And she lean'd on her oaken crutch, And a bundle of sticks she broke, And her prayers backward mutter'd, and the Devil's words utter'd. Though she never a word out spoke. “'Twas on a Thursday morn, That very day was se'nnight, I ran to sweet Sue, to bid her adieu, For I could not stay a minute. “Then crying with words so tender, She gave me a true lover's locket, That I still might love her, forgetting her never— So I put it in my pocket. “And then we kiss'd and parted, And knew not, all the while, That Martha was nigh, on her broomstick so high, Looking down with a devilish smile. “So I went to sea again, With my heart brim-full of Sue; Though my mind misgave me, the salt waters would have me, And I'd take my last adieu. “We made a prosperous voyage Till we came to this fatal coast, When a storm it did rise, in seas and in skies, That we gave ourselves up for lost. “Our vessel it was stranded All on the shoals of Achen, And all then did die, save only I, And I hardly saved my bacon. “It happ'd that very hour, The Black King walking by Did see me sprawling, on hands and knees crawling, And took to his palace hard by. “And finding that I was A likely lad for to see, My bones well knit, and my joints well set, And not above twenty-three, “He made me his gardener boy, To sow pease and potatoes, To water his flowers, when there were no showers, And cut his parsley and lettuce. “Now it so fell out on a Sunday (Which these Pagans never keep holy), I was gathering rue, and thinking on Sue, With a heart full of melancholy, “When the King of Achen's Daughter Did open her casement to see; And, as she look'd round on the gooseberry ground, Her eyes they lit upon me; “And seeing me tall and slim, And of shape right personable; My skin so white, and so very unlike The blacks at her Father's table, “She took it into her head (For so the Devil did move her), That I in good sooth, was a comely youth, And would make a gallant Lover. “So she tripp'd from her chamber so high, All in silks and satins clad, And her gown it rustled, as down she bustled, With steps like a Princess sad. “Her shoes they were deck'd with pearls, And her hair with diamonds glisten'd, And her gimcracks and toys, they made such a noise, My mouth water'd the while I listen'd. “Then she tempted me with glances, And with sugar'd words so tender, (And tho' she was black, she was straight in the back, And young, and tall, and slender—) “But I my Love remember'd, And the locket she did give me, And resolv'd to be true to my darling Sue, As she did ever believe me. “Whereat the Princess wax'd Both furious and angry, And said, she was sure I had some Paramour In kitchen or in laundry. “And then, with a devilish grin, She said, ‘Give me your locket’— But I damn'd her for a Witch, and a conjuring Bitch, And kept it in my pocket. “Howbeit, both day and night She did torture and torment, And said she, ‘If you'll yield to me the field, ‘I'll give thee thy heart's content. “‘But give me up the locket, ‘And stay three months with me, ‘And then, if the will remains with you still, ‘I'll ship you off to sea.” “So I thought it the only way To behold my lovely Sue, And the thoughts of Old England, they made my heart tingle, and I gave up the locket so true. “Thereon she laugh'd outright With a hellish grin, and I saw That the Princess was gone, and in her room There stood old Martha Daw. “She was all astride a Broomstick, And bid me get up behind; So my wits being lost, the Broomstick I cross'd, And away we flew, swift as the wind. “But my head it soon turn'd giddy, I reel'd and lost my balance, So I tumbled over, like a perjur'd lover, A warning to all gallants. “And there where I tumbled down The Indians found me lying; My head they cut off, and my blood did quaff, And set my flesh afrying. “Hence, all ye English gallants, A warning take by me, Your true love's locket to keep in your pocket Whenever you go to sea. “And, oh dear uncle Thomas, I come to give you warning, As then 'twas my chance with Davy to dance, 'Twill be yours to-morrow morning. “'Twas three years agone this night, Three years gone clear and clean, Since we sat down at Aunt's at the wedding to dance, And our number was thirteen. “Now I and sister Nan, (Two of that fatal party) Have both gone from Aunt's, with Davy to dance, Tho' then we were hale and hearty. “And, as we both have died, (I speak it with grief and sorrow—) At the end of each year, it now is clean That you should die to-morrow. “But if, good uncle Thomas, You'll promise, and promise truly, To plough the main for England again, And perform my orders duly, “Old Davy will allow you Another year to live, To visit your friends, and make up your odd ends, And your enemies forgive. “But friend, when you reach Old England, To Laure'ston town you'll go, And then to the Mayor, in open fair, Impeach old Martha Daw. “And next you'll see her hang'd With the halter around her throat; And, when void of life, with your clasp knife The string of her apron cut. “Then, if that you determine My last desires to do, In her left hand pocket, you'll find the locket, And carry it to Sue.” The grisly Spectre thus In mournful accents spoke, By which time, being morning, he gave me no warning, But vanish'd in sulphur and smoke. Next day there sprang up a breeze, And our ship began to tack, And for fear of the Ghost, we left the coast, And sail'd for England back. And I being come home, Did all his words pursue; Old Martha likewise was hung at the 'size, And I carried the locket to Sue. And now, being tired of life, I make up my mind to die; But I thought this story I'd lay before ye, For the good of Posterity. Oh never then sit at table When the number is thirteen; And, lest witches be there, put salt in your beer, And scrape your platters clean. TO THE CHILD OF CORINNA! Oh, boy! may the wit of thy mother awaking On thy dewy lip tremble, when years have gone by, While the fire of Odoherty, fervidly breaking, In glances and gleams, may illume thy young eye. Oh! then such a fulness of power shall be seen With the graces so blending, in union endearing, That angels shall glide o'er the ocean green, To catch a bright glimpse of the glory of Erin! Oh! sure such a vision of beauty and might, Commingling, in splendor, by him was exprest The old Lydian sculptor, the delicate sprite, That in Venus' soft girdle his Hercules drest. [“The ‘Whig,’ the lover, and the poet] “The ‘Whig,’ the lover, and the poet, Are of imagination all compact. One sees more devils than vast hell can hold— The madman.” [“Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea] “Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea, Whose icy current and compulsive course Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on To the Propontic and the Hellespont; Even so my ‘frantic’ thoughts, with violent pace, Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble sense, Till that a capable and wide revenge Swallow them up.” INCONSTANCY; A SONG TO MRS. M'WHIRTER. By Mr. Odoherty. “Ye fleeces of gold amidst crimson enroll'd That sleep in the calm western sky, Lovely relics of day float—ah! float not away! Are ye gone? then, ye beauties, good-bye!” It was thus the fair maid I had loved would have staid The last gleamings of passion in me; But the orb's fiery glow in the soft wave below Had been cooled—and the thing could not be. While thro' deserts you rove, if you find a green grove Where the dark branches overhead meet, There repose you a while from the heat and the toil, And be thankful the shade is so sweet; But if long you remain it is odds but the rain Or the wind 'mong the leaves may be stirring, They will strip the boughs bare—you're a fool to stay there— Change the scene without further demurring. If a rich-laden tree in your wanderings you see With the ripe fruit all glowing and swelling, Take your fill as you pass—if you don't you're an ass, But I daresay you don't need my telling— 'Twould be just as great fooling to come back for more pulling, When a week or two more shall have gone, These firm plums very rapidly, they will taste very vapidly, —By good luck we'll have pears coming on! All around Nature's range is from changes to changes, And in change all her charming is centered— When you step from the stream where you've bathed, 'twere a dream To suppose't the same stream that you entered; Each clear crystal wave just a passing kiss gave, And kept rolling away to the sea— So the love-stricken slave for a moment may rave, But ere long oh! how distant he'll be? Why—'tis only in name, you, e'en you, are the same With the she that inspired my devotion, Every bit of the lip that I lov'd so to sip Has been changed in the general commotion— Even these soft gleaming eyes that awaked my young sighs Have been altered a thousand times over; Why? Oh! why then complain that so short was your reign? Must all Nature go round but your lover? CHANT.—BY MRS. M'WHIRTER. Tune—The Powldoodies of Burran. I wonder what the mischief was in me when a bit of my music I proffered ye! How could any woman sing a good song when she's just parting with Morgan Odoherty? A poor body, I think, would have more occasion for a comfortable quiet can, To keep up her spirits in taking lave of so nate a young man— Besides, as for me, I'm not an orator like Bushe, Plunket, Grattan, or Curran, So I can only hum a few words to the old chant of the Powldoodies of Burran. Chorus —Oh! the Powldoodies of Burran, The green green Powldoodies of Burran, The green Powldoodies, the clean Powldoodies, The gaping Powldoodies of Burran. I remember a saying of my Lord Norbury, that excellent Judge, Says he, never believe what a man says to ye, Molly, for believe me 'tis all fudge; He said it sitting on the Bench before the whole Grand Jury of Tipperary, If I had minded it, I had been the better on't, as sure as my name's Mary: I would have paid not the smallest attention, ye good-for-nothing elf ye, To the fine speeches that took me off my feet in the swate city Philadelphy. Oh! the Powldoodies of Burran, &amp;c., &amp;c. By the same rule, says my dear Mr. Bushe, one night when I was sitting beside Mausey, “Molly, love,” says he, “if you go on at this rate, you've no idea what bad luck it will cause ye; You may go on very merrily for a while, but you'll see what will come on't, When to answer for all your misdeeds, at the last you are summoned; Do you fancy a young woman can proceed in this sad lightheaded way, And not suffer in the long run, tho' manetime she may merrily say, Oh! the Powldoodies of Burran, &amp;c., &amp;c. But I'm sure there's plenty of other people that's very near as bad as me. Yes, and I will make bould to affirm it in the very tiptopsomest degree; Only they're rather more cunning concealing on't, tho' they meet with their fops Every now and then, by the mass, about four o'clock in their Milliner's shops; In our own pretty Dame street I've seen it—the fine Lady comes commonly first, And then comes her beau on pretence of a watch-ribbon, or the like I purtest. Oh! the Powldoodies of Burran, &amp;c., &amp;c. But as for me, I could not withstand him, 'tis the beautiful dear Ensign I mean, When he came into the Shining Daisy with his milkwhite smallclothes so clean, With his epaulette shining on his shoulder, and his golden gorget at his breast, And his long silken sash so genteely twisted many times round about his neat waist; His black gaiters that were so tight, and reached up to a little below his knee, And shewed so well the prettiest calf e'er an Irish lass had the good luck to see. Oh! the Powldoodies of Burran, &amp;c., &amp;c. His eyes were like a flaming coal-fire, all so black and yet so bright, Or like a star shining clearly in the middle of the dark heaven at night, And the white of them was not white, but a sort of charming hue, Like a morning sky, or skimmed milk, of a delicate sweet blue; But when he whispered sweetly, then his eyes were so soft and dim, That it would have been a heart of brass not to have pity upon him, Oh! the Powldoodies of Burran, &amp;c., &amp;c And yet now you see he's left me like a pair of old boots or shoes, And makes love to all the handsome ladies, for ne'er a one of them can refuse; Through America and sweet Ireland, and Bath and London City, For he must always be running after something that's new and pretty, Playing the devil's own delights in Holland, Spain, Portugal, and France, And here too in the cold Scotch mountains, where I've met with him by very chance. Oh! the Powldoodies of Burran, &amp;c., &amp;c. When he first ran off and deserted me, I thought my heart was plucked away, Such a tugging in my breast, I did not sleep a wink till peep of day— May I be a sinner if I ever bowed but for a moment my eye-lid, Tossing round about from side to side in the middle of my bid. One minute kicking off all the three blankets, the sheets, and the counterpane, And then stuffing them up over my head like a body beside myself again. Oh! the Powldoodies of Burran, &amp;c., &amp;c. Says I to myself, I'll repeat over the whole of the Pater Noster, Ave-Maria, and Creed, If I don't fall over into a doze e'er I'm done with them 'twill be a very uncommon thing indeed; But, would you believe it? I was quite lively when I came down to the Amen, And it was always just as bad tho' I repeated them twenty times over and over again; I also tried counting of a thousand, but still found myself broad awake, With a cursed pain in the fore part of my head, all for my dear sweet Ensign Odoherty's sake. Oh! the Powldoodies of Burran, &amp;c., &amp;c. But, to cut a long story short, I was in a high fever when I woke in the morning, Whereby all women in my situation should take profit and warning; And Doctor Oglethorpe he was sent for, and he ordered me on no account to rise, But to lie still and have the whole of my back covered over with Spanish flies; He also gave me leeches and salts, castor oil, and the balsam capivi, Till I was brought down to a mere shadow, and so pale that the sight would have grieved ye. Oh! the Powldoodies of Burran, &amp;c., &amp;c. But in the course of a few days more I began to stump a little about, And by the blessing of air and exercise, I grew every day more and more stout; And in a week or two I recovered my twist, and could play a capital knife and fork, Being not in the least particular whether it was beef, veal, lamb, mutton, or pork; But of all the things in the world, for I was always my father's own true daughter, I liked best to dine on fried tripes, and wash it down with a little hot brandy and water. Oh! the Powldoodies of Burran, &amp;c., &amp;c. If I had the least bit of genius for poems, I could make some very nice songs, On the cruelties of some people's sweethearts, and some people's sufferings and wrongs; For he was master, I'm sure, of my house, and there was nothing at all at all In the whole of the Shining Daisy for which he could not just ring the bell and call; We kept always a good larder of pigeon pyes, hung beef, ham, and cowheel, And we would have got anything to please him that we could either beg, borrow, or steal. Oh! the Powldoodies of Burran, &amp;c., &amp;c. And at night when we might be taking our noggin in the little back-room, I thought myself as sure of my charmer as if he had gone to church my bridegroom; But I need not deep harping on that string and ripping up of the same old sore, He went off in the twinkling of a bed-post, and I never heard tell of him no more, So I married the great Doctor Oglethorpe, who had been my admirer all along, And we had some scolloped Powldoodies for supper; and every crature joined in the old song, Oh! the Powldoodies of Burran, &amp;c., &amp;c. Some people eats their Powldoodies quite neat just as they came out of the sea, But with a little black pepper and vinegar some other people's stomachs better agree; Young ladies are very fond of oyster pates, and young gentlemen of oyster broth, But I think I know a bit of pasture that is far better than them both: For whenever we want to be comfortable says I to the Doctor—my dear man, Let's have a few scolloped Powldoodies, and a bit of tripe fried in the pan, Chorus —Oh! the Powldoodies of Burran, The green green Powldoodies of Burran, The green Powldoodies, the clean Powldoodies, The gaping Powldoodies of Burran. ODOHERTY'S GARLAND. IN HONOR OF MRS. COOK, THE GREAT. Let the Emerald Isle make O'Brien her boast, And let Yorkshire be proud of her “strapping young man,” But London, gay London, should glory the most, She has reared Mrs. Cook, let them match her who can; This female Goliah is thicker and higher Than Italian Belzoni, or Highlandman Sam. Yet the terrible creature is pretty in feature, And her smile is as soft as a dove or a lamb. When she opens her eyelids she dazzles you quite With the vast flood of splendor that flashes around; Old Ajax, ambitious to perish in light, In one glance of her glory perdition had found. Both in verse and in prose, to the bud of a rose, Sweet lips have been likened by amorous beau; But her lips may be said to be like a rose-bed Their fragrance so full is, so broad is their glow. The similitudes used in king Solomon's book, In laudation of some little Jewess of old, If we only suppose them devised for the Cook, Would appear the reverse of improper or bold. There is many a tree that is shorter than she, In particular that on which Johnston was swung, Had the rope been about her huge arm, there's no doubt, That the friend of the Scotsman at once had been hung, The cedars that grew upon Lebanon hill, And the towers of Damascus might well be applied, With imperfect ideas the fancy to fill, Of the monstrous perfections of Cook's pretty bride. Oh! if one of the name be immortal in fame, Because round the wide globe he adventured to roam, Mr. Cook, I don't see why yourself should not be As illustrious as he without stirring from home! Quoth Odoherty. THE EVE OF ST. JERRY. [The reader will learn with astonishment that I composed the two following ballads in the fourteenth year of my age, i. e. A. D. 1780. I doubt if either Milton or Pope rivalled this precocity of genius. —M. O.] Dick Gossip the barber arose with the cock, And pull'd his breeches on; Down the staircase of wood, as fast as he could, The valiant shaver ran. He went not to the country forth To shave or frizzle hair; Nor to join in the battle to be fought At Canterbury fair. Yet his hat was fiercely cocked, and his razors in his pocket, And his torturing irons he bore; A staff of crab-tree in his hand had he, Full five feet long and more. The barber return'd in three days space, And blistered were his feet; And sad and peevish were his looks, As he turn'd the corner street. He came not from where Canterbury Ran ankle-deep in blood; Where butcher Jem, and his comrades grim, The shaving tribe withstood. Yet were his eyes bruis'd black and blue; His cravat twisted and tore; His razors were with gore imbued— But it was not professional gore. He halted at the painted pole, Full loudly did he rap, And whistled on his shaving boy, Whose name was Johnny Strap. Come hither, come hither, young tickle-beard, And mind that you tell me true, For these three long days that I've been away, What did Mrs. Gossip do? When the clock struck eight, Mrs. Gossip went straight, In spite of the pattering rain, Without stay or stop to the butcher's shop, That lives in Cleaver-lane. I watch'd her steps, and secret came Where she sat upon a chair. No person was in the butcher's shop— The devil a soul was there. The second night I 'spy'd a light As I went up the strand, 'Twas she who ran, with pattens on, And a lanthern in her hand: She laid it down upon a bench, And shook her wet attire; And drew in the elbow chair, to warm Her toes before the fire. In the twinkling of a walking stick, A greasy butcher came, And with a pair of bellows, he Blew up the dying flame. And many a word the butcher spoke To Mrs. Gossip there, But the rain fell fast, and it blew such a blast, That I could not tell what they were. The third night there the sky was fair, There neither was wind nor rain; And again I watch'd the secret pair At the shop in Cleaver-lane. And I heard her say, “Dick Gossip's away, So we'll be blithe and merry, And the bolts I'll undo, sweet butcher to you, On the eve of good St. Jerry.” “I can not come, I must not come”— “For shame, faint hearted snarler, Must I then moan, and sit alone, In Dicky Gossip's parlor. “The dog shall not tear you, and Strap shall not hear you, And blankets I'll spread on the stair; By the blood-red sherry, and holy St. Jerry, I conjure thee sweet butcher be there.” “Tho' the dog should not tear me, and Strap should not hear me. And blankets be spread on the stair, Yet there's Mr. Parrot, who sleeps in the garret, To my footsteps he could swear.”— “Fear not, Mr. Parrot, who sleeps in the garret, For to Hampstead the way he has ta'en; An inquest to hold, as I have been told, On the corpse of a butcher that's slain.” He turned him around, and grimly he frown'd, And he laugh'd right scornfully, “The inquest that's held, on the man that's been killed, May as well be held on me. “At the lone midnight hour, when hobgoblins have power, In thy chamber I'll appear;”— With that he was gone, and your wife left alone, And I came running here.”— Then changed I trow, was the barber's brow, From the chalk to the beet-root red, “Now tell me the mien of the butcher thou'st seen, By Mambrino I'll smite off his head.” “On the point of his nose, which was like a red rose, Was a wart of enormous size; And he made a great vaporing with a blue and white apron, And red stockings roll'd up to his thighs.” “Thou liest, thou liest, young Johnny Strap, It is all a fib you tell, For the butcher was taken, as dead as bacon, From the bottom of Carisbrook well.” “My master attend, and I'll be your friend, I don't value madam a button; But I heard Mistress say, don't leave, I pray, Sweet Timothy Slaughter-mutton.” He ope'd the shop door, the counter he jump'd o'er, And overturned Strap, Then bolted up the stair, where he found his lady fair, With the Kitten on her lap. “Now hail, now hail, thou lady bright,— Now hail, thou barber trim, What news from Canterbury fight, What news from bloody Jem?” “Canterbury is red with gore, For many a barber fell; And the mayor has charg'd us for evermore, To watch the butcher's well.”— Mrs. Gossip blush'd, and her cheek was flush'd, But the barber shook his head; And having observed that the night was cold, He tumbled into bed. Mrs. Gossip lay and mourn'd, and Dicky toss'd and turn'd; And he mutter'd while half asleep, The stone is large and round, and the halter tight and sound, And the well thirty fathoms deep. The gloomy dome of St. Paul's struck three, The morning began to blink, And Gossip slept, as if his wife Had put laudanum in his drink. Mrs. Gossip drew wide the curtains aside, The candle had burn'd to the socket, And lo! Timothy stood, all cover'd with blood, With his right hand in his pocket. “Dear Slaughter-mutton, away,” she cried, “I pray thee do not stop”— “Mrs. Gossip, I know, who sleeps by thy side, But he sleeps as sound as a top. “Near Carisbrook well I lately fell Beneath a barber's knife; The coroner's inquest was held on me— But it did not restore me to life. “By thy husband's hand, was I foully slain, He threw me into the well, And my sprite in the shop, in Cleaver-lane, For a season is doom'd to dwell.”— Love master'd fear—“What brings thee here?” The Love-sick matron said,— “Is thy fair carcase gone to pot?”— The goblin shook his head. “I slaughter'd sheep, and slaughter'd was, And for breaking the marriage band, My flesh and bones go to David Jones— But let us first shake hands.” He laid his left fist, on an oaken chest, And, as she cried—“don't burn us;” With the other he grasp'd her by the nose, And scorch'd her like a furnace. There is a felon in Newgate jail, Who dreads the next assize; A woman doth dwell, in Bedlam cell, With a patch between her eyes. The woman who dwells in Bedlam cell, Whose reason is not worth a button, Is the wife of the barber in Newgate jail, Who slaughter'd Slaughter-mutton. THE RIME OF THE AUNCIENT WAGGONERE. IN FOUR PARTS. Part First. It is an auncient Waggonere, An auncient waggonere stoppeth ane tailore going to a wedding, whereat he hath been appointed to be best manne, and to take a hand in the casting of the slippere. And hee stoppeth one of nine:— “Now wherefore dost thou grip me soe With that horny fist of thine?” “The bridegroom's doors are opened wide, The waggonere in mood for chat, and admits of no excuse. And thither I must walke; Soe, by youre leave, I must be gone, I have noe time for talke!” Hee holds him with his horny fist— The tailore seized with the ague. “There was a wain,” quothe hee, “Hold offe thou raggamouffine tykke,”— Eftsoones his fist dropped hee. Hee satte him downe upon a stone, He listeneth like a three years and a half child. With ruefulle looks of feare; And thus began this tippyse manne, The red nosed waggonere. “The waine is fulle, the horses pulle, The appetite of the tailore whetted by the smell of cabbage. Merrilye did we trotte Alonge the bridge, alonge the road, A jolly crewe I wotte;”— And here the tailore smotte his breaste, He smelte the cabbage potte! “The nighte was darke, like Noe's arke, The waggonere, in talking anent Boreas, maketh bad orthographye. Oure waggone moved alonge; The hail pour'd faste, loude roared the blaste, Yet stille we moved alonge; And sung in chorus, ‘Cease loud Borus,’ A very charminge songe. “‘Bravoe, bravissimoe,’ I cried, Their mirthe interrupted. The sounde was quite elatinge; But, in a trice, upon the ice, We hearde the horses skaitinge. “The ice was here, the ice was there, And the passengers exercise themselves in the pleasant art of swimminge, as doeth also their prog, to witte, great store of colde roasted beef; item, ane beefstake pye; item, viii choppines of usquebaugh. It was a dismale mattere, To see the cargoe, one by one, Flounderinge in the wattere! “With rout and roare, we reached the shore, And never a soul did sinke; But in the rivere, gone for evere, Swum our meate and drinke. The waggonere hailethe ane goose. with ane novel salutatione.“At lengthe we spied a goode grey goose, Thorough the snow it came; And with the butte ende of my whippe, I hailed it in Goddhis name. “It staggered as it had been drunke, So dexterous was it hitte; Of brokene boughs we made a fire, Thomme Loncheone roasted itte.”— The tailore impatient to be gone, but is forcibly persuaded to remain.“Be done, thou tipsye waggonere, “To the feaste I must awaye.”— The waggonere seized him bye the coatte, And forced him there to staye, Begginge, in gentlemanlie style, Butte halfe ane hour's delaye. Part Second. The waggonere's bowels yearn towards the sunne.“The crimson sunne was rising o'ere The verge of the horizon; Upon my worde, as faire a sunne As ever I clapped eyes onne. The passengers throwe the blame of the goose massacre on the innocent waggonere.“'Twill be ane comfortable thinge,” The mutinouus crewe 'gan crye; “'Twill be an comfortable thinge, Within the jaile to lye; Ah! execrable wretche,” saide they, “Thatte caused the goose to die! The sunne sufferes ane artificial eclipse, and horror follows, the same not being mentioned in the Belfaste Almanacke.“The day was drawing near itte's close, The sunne was well nighe settinge; When lo it seemed as iffe his face Was veiled with fringe-warke-nettinge. Various hypotheses on the subject, frome whiche the passengeres draw wronge conclusions.“Somme saide itte was ane apple tree, Laden with goodlye fruite, Somme swore itte was ane foreigne birde, Some said it was ane brute; Alas! it was ane bumbailiffe, Riding in pursuite! “A hue and crye sterte uppe behind, Ane lovelye sound ariseth; ittes effects described. Whilke smote oure ears like thunder, Within waggone there was drede, Astonishmente and wonder. “One after one, the rascalls rann, The passengers throw somersets. And from the carre did jump; One after one, one after one, They felle with heavy thump. “Six miles ane houre theye offe did scoure, Like shippes on ane stormye ocean, Theire garments flappinge in the winde, With ane shorte uneasy motion. “Their bodies with their legs did flye, The waggonere complimenteth the bumbailiffe with ane Mendoza. Theye fled withe feare and glyffe; Why star'st thoue soe?—With one goode blow, I felled the bumbailiffe!” Part Third. “I feare thee, auncient waggonere, I feare thy hornye fiste, For itte is stained with gooses gore, And bailiffe's blood, I wist. “I fear to gette ane fisticuffe The tailore meeteth Corporal Feare. From thy leathern knuckles brown; With that the tailore strove to ryse— The waggonere thrusts him down. “‘Thou craven, if thou mov'st a limbe, I'll give thee cause for feare;’— And thus went on, that tipsye man, The red-billed waggonere. The bumbailiffe so beautifull! The bailiffe complaineth of considerable derangement of his animal economye. Declared itte was no joke, For, to his knowledge, both his legs, And fifteen ribbes were broke. “The lighte was gone, the nighte came on, Policemen with their lanthernes, pursue the waggonere. Ane hundrede lantherns sheen, Glimmerred upon the kinge's highwaye, Ane lovelye sighte I ween. “‘Is it he,’ quoth one, ‘is this the manne, I'll laye the rascalle stiffe;’— With cruel stroke the beak he broke Of the harmless bumbailiffe. Steppeth 20 feete in imitatione of the Admirable Crichtoun.“The threatening of the saucye rogue No more I coulde abide. Advancing forthe my goode right legge, Three paces and a stride, I sent my lefte foot dexterously Seven inches thro' his side. Complaineth of foul play, and falleth down in ane trance.“Up came the seconde from the vanne; We had scarcely fought a round, When some one smote me from behinde, And I fell down in a swound: One acteth the parte of Job's comfortere.“And when my head began to clear, I heard the yemering crew— Quoth one, ‘this man hath penance done, And penance more shall do.’” Part Fourth. The waggonere maketh ane shrewd observation.“Oh! Freedom is a glorious thing!— And tailore, by the bye, I'd rather in a halter swing, Than in a dungeon lie. The waggonere tickleth the spleen of the jailor, who daunces ane Fadango.“The jailore came to bring me foode, Forget it will I never, How he turned up the white o' his eye, When I stuck him in the liver. Rejoicethe in the fragrance of the aire.“His threade of life was snapt; once more I reached the open streete; The people sung out ‘Gardyloo’ As I ran down the streete. Methought the blessed air of heaven Never smelte so sweete. Dreadeth Shoan Dhu, the corporal of the guarde.“Once more upon the broad highwaye, I walked with feare and drede; And every fifteen steppes I tooke I turned about my heade, For feare the corporal of the guarde Might close behind me trede! “Behold upon the western wave, Setteth the broad bright sunne; So I must onward, as I have Full fifteen miles to runne;— “And should the bailliffes hither come The waggonere taketh leave of the tailore, To aske whilke waye I've gone, Tell them I took the othere road, Said hee, and trotted onne.” The tailore rushed into the roome, O'erturning three or foure; To whome ane small accidente happeneth. Whereupon followeth the morale very proper to be had in minde by all members of the Dilettanti Society when they come over the bridge at these houres. Wherefore let them take heed and not lay blame where it lyeth nott. Fractured his skulle against the walle, And worde spake never more!! Morale. Such is the fate of foolish men, The danger all may see, Of those, who list to waggonere, And keepe bad companye. Maxims of ODoherty. Maxim Twenty-second. Come to the meeting, there's drinking and eating, Plenty and famous, your bellies to cram; Jupiter Ammon, with gills red as salmon, Twists round his eyebrows the horns of a ram. Juno the she-cock has harnessed her peacock, Warming the way with a drop of a dram; Phœbus Apollo in order will follow, Lighting the road with his old patent flam. Cuckoldy Vulcan, dispatching a full can, Limps to the banquet on tottering ham; Venus her sparrows, and Cupid his arrows, Sport on th' occasion—fine infant and dam. Mars, in full armour, to follow his charmer, Looks as ferocious as Highlander Sam; Jocus and Comus ride tandem with Momus, Cheering the road with gibe, banter, and bam. Madam Latona, the old Roba Bona, Simpering as mild as a fawn or a lamb, Drives with Aurora the red-nosed Signora, With fingers as rosy as raspberry jam. Maxim Seventy-first. (Composed after six months' residence in Athens.) John Brougham for bordeaux, Robert Cockburn for champagne, John Ferguson for hocks, Cay for Sherris sack of Spain. Phin for rod, pirn, and hooks, Dunn for congé and salaam, Bailie Blackwood for books, Macvey Napier for balaam. Sir Walter for fables, Peter Robertson for speeches, Mr. Trotter for tables, Mr. Bridges for breeches. Gall for coaches and gigs, Steele for ices and jam, Mr. Urquhart for wigs, Mr. Jeffrey for bam. Lord Morton for the zebra, Billy Allan for the brush, Johnny Leslie for the Hebrew, And myself for a blush. DON JUAN UNREAD. BYRON. Of Corinth Castle we had read The amazing Siege unravelled, Had swallowed Lara and the Giaour, And with Childe Harold travelled; And so we followed cloven-foot As faithfully as any, Until he cried, “Come, turn aside And read of Don Giovanni.” “Let Whiggish folk, frae Holland House, Who have been lying, prating, Read Don Giovanni, 'tis their own, A child of their creating! On jests profane they love to feed, And there they are—and many; But we, who link not with the crew, Regard not Don Giovanni. “There's Godwin's daughter, Shelley's wife, A writing fearful stories; There's Hazlitt, who, with Hunt and Keats Brays forth in Cockney chorus; There's pleasant Thomas Moore, a lad Who sings of Rose and Fanny; Why throw away these wits so gay To take up Don Giovanni. “What's Juan but a shameless tale, That bursts all rules asunder? There are a thousand such elsewhere As worthy of your wonder.” Strange words they seem'd of slight and scorn; His lordship look'd not canny; And took a pinch of snuff, to think I flouted Don Giovanni. “O! rich,” said I, “are Juan's rhymes, And warm its verse is flowing! Fair crops of Blasphemy it bears, But we will leave them growing. In Pindar's strain, in prose of Paine, And many another Zanny, As gross, we read, so where's the need, To wade through Don Giovanni. “Let Colburn's town-bred cattle snuff The filths of Lady Morgan, Let Maturin to amorous themes Attune his barrel organ! We will not read them, will not hear The parson or the granny; And, I dare say, as bad as they, Or worse, is Don Giovanni. “Be Juan then unseen, unknown! It must, or we may rue it; We may have virtue of our own; Ah! why should we undo it? The treasured faith of days long past, We still shall prize o'er any; And we shall grieve to hear the gibes Of scoffing Don Giovanni. “When Whigs with freezing rule shall come, And piety seem folly; When Cam and Isis curbed by Brougham, Shall wander melancholy; When Cobbet, Wooler, Watson, Hunt, And all the swinish many, Shall rough-shod ride o'er church and state, Then hey! for Don Giovanni.” The Irishman and the Lady. (To be sung with boisterous expression.) I There was a lady lived at Leith, A lady very stylish, man; And yet, in spite of all her teeth, She fell in love with an Irishman. A nasty, ugly Irishman, A wild, tremendous Irishman— A tearing, swearing, thumping, bumping, ramping, roaring Irishman. II His face was no ways beautiful, For with small-pox 'twas scarr'd across; And the shoulders of the ugly dog Were almost doubled a yard across. O, the lump of an Irishman, The whisky-devouring Irishman— The great he-rogue, with his wonderful brogue, the fighting, rioting, Irishman. III One of his eyes was bottle-green, And the other eye was out, my dear; And the calves of his wicked-looking legs Were more than two feet about, my dear, O, the great big Irishman, The rattling, battling Irishman— The stamping, ramping, swaggering, staggering, leathering swash of an Irishman. IV He took so much of Lundy-Foot, That he used to snort and snuffle—O; And in shape and size, the fellow's neck, Was as bad as the neck of a buffalo. O, the horrible Irishman, The thundering, blundering Irishman— The slashing, dashing, smashing, lashing, thrashing, hashing Irishman. V His name was a terrible name, indeed, Being Timothy Thady Mulligan; And whenever he emptied his tumbler of punch, He'd not rest till he filled it full again. The boozing, bruising Irishman, The 'toxicated Irishman— The whisky, frisky, rummy, gummy, brandy, no dandy Irishman. VI This was the lad the lady loved, Like all the girls of quality; And he broke the skulls of the men of Leith, Just by the way of jollity. O, the leathering Irishman, The barbarous, savage Irishman— The hearts of the maids, and the gentlemen's heads, were bother'd, I'm sure, by this Irishman. Here Let me Dine. 'Tis not when on turtle and venison dining, And sipping Tokay at the cost of his Grace; Like the plate on his sideboard, I'm set to be shining— (So nearly a mug may resemble a face.) This is not the dinner for me—a poor sinner; Where I'm bound to show off, and throw pearls before swine. Give me turnips and mutton,—(I ne'er was a glutton)— Good friends and good liquor—and here let me dine. Your critic shows off, with his snatches and tastes Of odd trash from Reviews, and odd sorts of odd wine; Half a glass—half a joke—from the Publisher's stock Of Balaam and Hock, are but trash, I opine. Convérsazioni—are not for my money, Where Blue Stockings prate about Wylie and Pen; I'd rather get tipsy with ipsissimi ipsi— Plain women must yield to plain sense and plain men. Your dowager gives you good dinners, 'tis true; She shines in liqueurs, and her Sherry's antique; But then you must swear by her eye's lovely blue, And adore the bright bloom that is laid on her cheek. Blue eyes in young faces are quite in their places; One praises and gazes with boundless delight And juvenile roses ne'er trespass on noses, As the custom of those is, I've cut for to-night. Your colonels talk but of a siege or a battle— Your merchants of naught but the course of exchange— Your squires, of their hounds, of the corn-bill or cattle— Your doctors their cases and cures will arrange— Your lawyer's confounding, on multiple poinding— Your artists are great on expression and tone— Parsons sport Moderators and Church-procurators, Each set is the devil when feeding alone. But here, where all sets and all topics are mingled— The hero—the dentist—the parson—the squire— No one branch of blarney's selected or singled,— But our wine and our wit each discussion inspire; Where the pun and the glass simultaneously pass; Where each song seems quite heavenly, each bumper divine; Where there's drinking and smoking, and quizzing and joking, But nothing provoking—Here! Here! let me dine. [Oh! lovely Polly Savage] Oh! lovely Polly Savage, O! charming Polly Savage, Your eye beats Day and Martin, Your cheek is like red cabbage. As I was going down the Strand It smote my heart with wonder, To see the lovely damsel, A-sitting at a vinder. Oh! lovely Polly Savage, &amp;c. Oh! once I loved another girl, Her name it was Maria; But, Polly dear, my love for you Is forty-five times higher. O! lovely Polly Savage, &amp;c. We'll take a shop in Chicken Lane, And I will stand prepared, To sell fat bacon by the pound, And butter by the yard. O! lovely Polly Savage, &amp;c. And when at five o'clock, my love, We sit us down to dine, How I will toast your darling health, In draughts of currant vine. Oh! lovely Polly Savage, &amp;c. Oh then our little son shall be As wanton as a spaniel, Him that we mean to christen'd be, Jacques Timothy Nathaniel. Oh! lovely Polly Savage, &amp;c. And if we have a little girl, I'm sure you wont be sorry To hear me call the pretty elf Euphemiar Helen Laurar. Oh! lovely Polly Savage, &amp;c. Then fare-thee-well a little space, My heart can never falter, And next time when I see your face, 'Twill be at Hymen's haltar. Oh! lovely Polly Savage &amp;c. THE SOMNAMBULATORY BUTCHER.—An Episode. Reflections—birth,—parentage,—boyish tricks,—education,—change of dress,—apprenticeship,—bladders and Dr. Lavement,—bad habits,—ditto cured by his mother,—caution,—and moral. Men's legs, if man may trust the common talk, Are engines put in motion when men walk; But when we cross our knees, and take a chair Beside the fire, they're not in motion there: So this we learn by wisdom, art, and skill, That legs are made to stir, or to sit still. Yet sometimes I have heard, that when the head In woollen cap lay snoring on the bed, The legs, without the sanction of the brain, Were fond to wander on the midnight plain, Pursue, mid darkness, tasks of common day, Yet come, as will'd Caprice, unharm'd away; Which to illustrate, let the reader bend A willing ear, and list his warning friend. James Neckum Theodore Emmanuel Reid, Was meanly born, and was ignobly bred, Lived upon pottage, slept within a shed; His mother,—But it were in vain to look— Her's was no marriage by the session book; His mother, fool, had never taken pains To gird her neck with matrimonial chains, And he, her leman, seeing what would be, Turn'd a blue-neck'd marine, and cross'd the sea; So, in neglect and wrath the child was born, While neighbours chuckled with their looks of scorn; But fast he throve, and fat he grew, and that Was felt most keenly by the tortured cat, Whose ears he pinch'd, whose tail he drew, until 'Twas forced, when fairly vanquish'd, to lie still; The chickens too, no sinecure of life Had with the boy, who pull'd their necks in strife, Till from their sockets started their black eyes, And died their vanish'd voice in feeble cries. At length a cap upon his head was braced, Shoes shod his feet, and breeches girt his waist; Tall as a leek he grew, his hair was long, And through its folds the wild winds sang a song; From mother's clutches oft would he elope, And little knew his morning face of soap; Till, having spent the morn in game and play With comrades dirty, frolicsome, and gay, As duly as the village clock struck two, As duly parted he from ragged crew, And homewards wended, fast and nothing loth, To dip his whispers in his mother's broth. The boy grew strong; the master of the school Took him in charge, and with a birch did rule; Full long and oft he blubber'd; but, at length, Within a week he learned to letter tenth; And ere six moons had waxed, and waned, and set, He had reached z, and knew his alphabet. His education finish'd, choice he made Of a most lucrative and wholesome trade; The leathern cap was now dismiss'd; and red, Yea fiery, glow'd the cowl upon his head: And, like a cherry dangling from the crown, A neat wool tassel in the midst hung down; Around his waist, with black tape girded tight, Was tied a worsted apron, blue and white; His Shetland stockings, mocking winter's cold, Despising garters, up his thighs were roll'd, And, by his side, horn-handled steels, and knives, Gleam'd from his pouch, and thirsted for sheep's lives. For, dexterous, he could split dead cows in halves, And, though a calf himself, he slaughter'd calves. But brisker look'd the youth, and nothing sadder, For of each mother's son he got the bladder, And straight to Galen's-head in joy he bore it, Where Dr. Lavement gave a penny for it. But he had failings as I said before, So, duly as his nose began to snore, His legs ran with his body to the door: And forth he used to roam, with sidelong neck, To—as the Scot's folks term it—lift the sneck. All in his shirt and woollen cap he strayed, Silent, though dreaming; cold, but undismay'd. The moon was shining 'mid the depth of Heaven, And from the chill north, fleecy clouds were driven Athwart its silver aspect, till they grew Dimmer, and dimmer, in the distant blue; The trees were rustling loud; nor moon, nor trees, Nor cloud, could on his dreaming frenzy seize, But, walking with closed eyes across the street, He lifted handsomely his unshod feet, Till nought, at length, his wandering ankles propt, And head and heels into the pond he dropt. Then rose the loud lament; the earth and skies Rung with his shouts, and echoed with his cries; The neighbours, in their night-caps, throng'd around, Call'd forth in marching order at the sound; They hauled young Neckum out, a blanket roll'd Around his limbs with comfortable fold, Hurried him home, and told him, cursing deep, “That if again with cries he broke their sleep, Him they would change into a wandering ghost, Draw from the pond, but hang him on a post.” Oh! reader, learn this truth most firm and sure, That vicious practices are hard to cure; That error girds up with a serpent fold, Hangs on the youth, but clings about the old.— Night after night, if rainy, cold, or fair, Forth went our hero, just to take the air; Ladies were terrified, and, fainting, cried, A ghost in white had wander'd by their side! The soldier home his quaking path pursued, With hair on end, gun cock'd, and bayonet screw'd And frightful children run to bed in fear, When mothers said the ghost in white was near! 'Twas a hard case, but Theodore's mother quick Fell on a scheme to cure him of the trick; Hard by his bed a washing-tub she placed, So, when he rose, it washed him to the waist; And loud he roar'd,—while startled at the sound, Old women bolted from their beds around— “Save, save a wandering sinner, or he's drown'd!!!” He rose no more, as I'm informed in sleep, But duly fell'd down cows, and slaughter'd sheep, Took to himself a wife, a pretty wench, Sold beef by pounds, and cow-heel on a bench; In ten years had seven boys, and five fair girls, With cheeks like roses, and with teeth like pearls Lay still in bed like any decent man, Pursued through life a staid and honest plan, And lived beloved, while honours thicken'd o'er him, Justice of Peace, and Custos Rotulorum. So all my readers from this tale may learn, The right way from the wrong way to discern; Never by dreams and nonsense to be led, Walk when they wake, and slumber when in bed! AILIE MUSHAT'S CAIRN. A Vision-like remembrance of a Vision. The night was dark; not a star was view'd Mid the dim, and cloudy solitude; I listen'd to the watchman's cry, And to the midnight breeze, that sung Round the ruins of St. Anthony, With dismal, and unearthly tongue: I scarcely felt the path I trode; And I durst not linger to look behind, For I knew that spirits were abroad, And heard their shrieks on the passing wind; When lo! a spectacle of dread and awe With trembling knees, and stiffening hair I saw! A grave-light spread its flames of blue, Its flames of blue and lurid red, And, in the midst, a hellish crew Were seated round the stony bed Of one, whom Murder robb'd of life!— I saw the hand that held the knife, It was her husband's hand, and yet With the life-gore the blade was wet, Dripping like a fiery sheath, On the mossy cairn beneath! The vision changed; and, on the stones, With visage savage, fierce, and wild, Above the grave that held her bones, The ghost of Ailie Mushat smiled; It was a sight of dread and fear— A chequered napkin bound her head, Her throat was cut from ear to ear, Her hands and breast were spotted red; She strove to speak, but from the wound Her breath came out with a broken sound! I started! for she strove to rise, And pierced me with her bloodshot eyes; She strove to rise, but fast I drew Upon the grass a circle round; I said a prayer, and she withdrew Slowly within the stony mound— And trembling, and alone I stood, In the depth of the midnight solitude. ODE ON THE DEATH OF YAHMASSEERO, COUNCILLOR OF STATE. Free Translation. I Pray, have you heard the news? One of the footguards drew His cutlas; in a rage His anger to assuage, A councillor he slew! II Yahmahsseero's robe Is stained with fiery gore, And each that doth him meet, Calls him upon the street, The crimson councillor. III The current to the east By Sahnno, little town, Hath overflown, and burst the dike With fury, and the castle, like A fool, hath fallen down. IV Who has felled the cherry trees? And who has felled the plum? Trees planted in neat boxes, And anything but hoaxes For odoriferous gum. V A councillor hath been knocked From off his legs,—most true; If ever such a thing was heard, It may most safely be averr'd That it hath been—adieu! STANZAS. Oh mine be the shade, &amp;c. Oh! mine be the shade where no eye may discover, Where in silence and sorrow alone I may dwell; Give scorn to the maid, who is false to her lover; A tear unto her, who has loved but too well! Alas for the heart, when affection forsaking The vows, it has pledged, and has cherish'd through years; For no refuge remains to that lone heart but breaking, The silence of grief, and the solace of tears! Farewell the bright prospects that once could allure me To think this poor earth was a promise of Heaven; Since he, who once doated, no more can endure me, Too much with the darkness of fate I have striven; The flowers with their odours—the birds with their singing— The beauties of earth, and the glories of sky, Dear—sad recollections are constantly bringing— And all that remains upon earth is—to die!! [The hounds in the kennel are yelling loud] The hounds in the kennel are yelling loud, The hawks are boune for flight; For the sun hath burst from his eastern shroud, And the sky is clear, without a cloud, And the steed for the chase is dight: The merry huntsmen, up in the morn, Crack the long whip, and wind the horn. Lord Timothy rubbed his eyes, and rose When he heard the merry crew; He scarce took space to don his clothes, And his night-cap quick he threw Back on the pillow, and down the stair, Disdaining brush or comb for hair, With lightning speed he flew; And in the twinkling of a fan, With frock and cap, the gallant man, Caparison'd all spick and span, Was with the waiting crew. Sir Abraham rode his bonny gray; Sir Anthony his black; Lord Hector hath mounted his sprightly bay; Lord Tom, Lord Jack, and all are away; Curvet, and demivolte, and neigh, Mark out their bold and brisk array, With buckskins bright, and bonnets gay, And bugles at each back. They had hardly ridden a mile, a mile, A mile but barely ten, As each after each they leaped a stile, When their heart play'd pit-a-pat the while, To see a troop of armed men, A troop of gallant men at drill, With well soap'd locks, and stiffen'd frill; Each in his grasp held spear or sword, Ready to murder at a word, And ghastly was each warrior's smile, Beneath his barred aventayle; Buff belts were girt around each waist; Steel cuisses round each thigh were braced; Around each knee were brazen buckles; And iron greaves to save their knuckles; High o'er each tin-bright helmet shone The casque, and dancing morion, Which reach'd to where the tailor sets, On shoulder, woollen epaulets; Their blades were of Toledo steel, Ferarra, or Damascus real; Yea! human eye did never see, Through all the days of chivalry, Men more bedight from head to heel, &amp;c. Lady Alice she sits in the turret tower, A-combing her raven hair; The clock hath tolled the vesper hour, Already the shadows of evening lower To veil the landscape fair. To the jetty fringe of her piercing eye She raised her opera glass, For she was anxious to espy If her worthy knight should pass.— “Lo! yonder he comes,”—she sigh'd and said, Then with a rueful shake of head— “Shall I my husband ne'er discover— 'Tis but the white cow eating clover!” She looked again,—“Sure yon is he, That gallops so fast along the lea! Alas! 'tis only a chestnut tree!! Standing as still as still can be!!!” —“Come hither, come hither, my little foot page, And dance, my anguish to assuage; And be it jig, or waltz, or reel, I care not, so it doth conceal The ghosts, that of a thousand dies, Float evermore before mine eyes; And I, to make thee foot it gay, With nimble finger, by my fay, Upon the tambourine will play!” &amp;c. FRAGMENT OF A VISION. A dandy, on a velocipede, I saw in a vision sweet, Along the highway making speed, With his alternate feet. Of a bright and celestial hue Gleam'd beauteously his blue surtout; While ivory buttons, in a row, Show'd like the winter's cavern'd snow, Which the breezy North Drives sweeping forth, To lodge in the cave below: Ontario's beaver, without demur, To form his hat did lend its fur: His frill was of the cambric fine, And his neckcloth starch'd, and aquiline; And oh, the eye with pleasure dwells On his white jean indescribables; And he throws the locks from his forehead fair, And he pants, and pants, and pants for air; What is the reason I cannot tell,— There is a cause—I know it well; Too firmly bound—too tightly braced, The corsets grasp his spider waist, Till his coat tails are made to fly Even from the back they glorify. Look again, he is not there— Vanish'd into the misty air! Look again!—do ye see him yet? Ah no! the bailiff hath seized him for debt; And, to and fro, like a restless ghost, When peace within the grave is lost, He paces as far, as far he should, Within the bounds of Holyrood! THE GALIONGEE. A Fragment of a Turkish Tale. Advertisement.—The Author of this tale begs to inform the public, that the scattered fragments which it presents were collected from an improvisatore, who recited during the time that the author drank his fifth cup of Mocha with that civilest of all gentlemen, Ali Pacha. The Pacha sat in his divan, With silver-sheathed ataghan; And call'd to him a Galiongee, Come lately from the Euxine Sea To Stamboul; chains were on his feet, And fetters on his hands were seen, Because he was a Nazarene: When, duly making reverence meet, With haughty glance on that divan, And curling lip, he thus began: “By broad Phingari's silver light, When sailing at the noon of night, Bismillah! whom did we descry But dark corsairs, who, bent on spoil, Athwart the deep sea ever toil!— We know their blood-red flags on high: The Capitan he call'd, belike, With gesture proud, to bid us strike, And told his Sonbachis to spare Of not one scalp a single hair, Though garbs of green showed Emirs there! It boots not, Pacha, to relate What souls were sent to Eblis throne, How Azrael's arrows scatter'd fate, How wild, wet, wearied, and alone, When all my crew were drench'd in blood, Or floated lifeless on the flood, I fought, unawed, nor e'er thought I To shout ‘Amaun,’ the craven's cry.— I took my handkerchief to wipe My burning brow, and then I took, With placid hand, my long chibouque, That is to say, my Turkish pipe, And having clapp'd it in my cheek, Disdaining ere a word to speak, I shouted to the pirate, ‘Now, You've fairly beat me, I allow,’” &amp;c. [Oh! mortal man, how varied is thy lot] Oh! mortal man, how varied is thy lot, Thy ecstasies of joy and sorrow, how Chill'd, sunk, and servile art thou, or how hot Flashes indignant beauty from thy brow! Times change, and empires fall; the gods allow Brief space for human contemplation, and Above all partial dictates disavow Unequal love; how can we, at their hand, For individual fate a gentler boon demand! Childe Paddy parted from his father's cot; It was not castle proud, nor palace high, Extraneous symmetry here glitter'd not, But turf-built walls and filth did meet the eye; Loud was the grumph and grumble from hog-stye; Swans gleam'd not here, as on the Leman lake, But goose and ducklings, famed for gabbling cry, With quack, quack, quack, did make the roofs to shake, Till in their utmost holes the wondering rats did quake! He thought of father, whom he loved, and left; He thought of mother, at her booming wheel; He thought of sister, of his care bereft; He thought of brethren dear; and, to conceal The endless pangs that o'er his brain did reel, As through the vale his pensive way he took, For fear his onward purpose would congeal He sung, while pacing with right-forward look, “Sweet Kitty of Coleraine,” and “Fair of Donabrooke!” [Theyre wals ane Brounie offe mucle faime] Theyre wals ane Brounie offe mucle faime Thatte ussit too cumme too ane aulde fairme housse Ande evir the maydes fro theyre beddes came, Alle theyre werke wals dune, soo cannye and douce.

THE KAIL POT. If e'er, in pensive guise, thy steps have stray'd At eve or morn, along that lofty street, Yclept the Canongate, exalt thine eyes, And lo! between thee and the azure sky, Dangling in negro blackness beautiful, A kail pot hangs, upon an iron bar Suspended, and by iron chains hung down. Beneath it yawns a threshold, like the den Of Cacus, giant old, or like the caves Of sylvan satyrs in the forests green;— There enter, and, amid his porter butts, In conscious wisdom bold, sits Nathan Goose, Worshipping the muses and a mug of ale! Sweet are the songs of Nathan Goose, and strong Yea! potent is the liquor that he sells; On many a cold and icy winter night, When stars were sparkling in the deep blue sky, Have, circling round his board, a jovial throng, Tippled until the drowsy chime of twelve. Strange has it seem'd to me, that we, who breathe Vapours, as watery as the cooling drops Of Rydal Mere, should drink combustibles, And perish not; yet, thereby, of the soul The cogitations are disturb'd; its dreams Are hollows by reality and time Fulfill'd not, and the waking spirit mourns, When shines the sun above the eastern sea,— The ocean seen from Black Comb's summit high, And throws his yellow light against the pane Of chamber window,—window deep embower'd With honey-suckle blossoms;—o'er the wrecks Of such fantastical, and inane stuff, Shadows, and dreams, and visions of the night.— Then follow headaches dreadful, vomitings Of undigested biscuit, mingled with The sour and miserable commixture of Hot aqua vitæ, with the mountain lymph,— If city water haply be so call'd,— The lymph of Fountain-well, hard by the shop Where seeds and roots are sold, above whose door The black-eyed eagle spreads his golden wings. Hard is the lot of him, whom evil fates Have destined to a way of life unmeet; Whose genius and internal strength are clogg'd By drudgery, and the rubs of common men. But I have gazed upon thee, Nathan Goose, Gazed on the workings of thy inward soul— Hail'd with delight thy planet in the sky, And mid the constellations planted thee! &amp;c. BILLY BLINN. I knew a man that died for love, His name, I ween, was Billy Blinn; His back was hump'd, his hair was gray, And, on a sultry summer day, We found him floating in the linn. Once as he stood before his door, Smoking, and wondering who should pass, Then trundling past him in a cart Came Susan Foy, she won his heart, She was a gallant lass. And Billy Blinn conceal'd the flame That burn'd, and scorch'd his very blood; But often was he heard to sigh, And with his sleeve he wiped his eye, In a dejected mood. A party of recruiters came To wile our cottars, man and boy; Their coats were red, their cuffs were blue, And boldly, without more ado, Off with the troop went Susan Foy! When poor old Billy heard the news, He tore his hairs so thin and gray; He beat the hump upon his back, And ever did he cry, “Alack, Ohon, oh me!—alas a-day!” His nights were spent in sleeplessness, His days in sorrow and despair; It could not last—this inward strife; The lover he grew tired of life, And saunter'd here and there. At length, 'twas on a moonlight eve, The skies were blue, the winds were still; He wander'd from his wretched hut And, though he left the door unshut, He sought the lonely hill. He look'd upon the lovely moon, He look'd upon the twinkling stars; “How peaceful all is there,” he said, “No noisy tumult there is bred, And no intestine wars.” But misery overcame his heart, For all was waste and war within; And rushing forward with a leap, O'er crags a hundred fathoms steep, He plunged into the linn. We found him when the morning sun Shone brightly from the eastern sky; Upon his back he was afloat— His hat was sailing like a boat— His staff was found on high. Oh, reckless woman, Susan Foy, To leave the poor, old, loving man, And with a soldier, young and gay, Thus harlot-like to run away To India or Japan. Poor Billy Blinn, with hair so white, Poor Billy Blinn was stiff and cold; Will Adze he made a coffin neat, We placed him in it head and feet, And laid him in the mould! Inishowen. I I care not a fig for a flagon of flip, Or a whistling can of rumbo; But my tongue through whisky punch will slip As nimble as Hurlothrumbo. So put the spirits on the board, And give the lemons a squeezer, And we'll mix a jorum, by the Lord! That will make your worship sneeze, sir. II The French, no doubt, are famous souls, I love them for their brandy; In rum and sweet tobacco rolls, Jamaica men are handy. The big-breech'd Dutch in juniper gin, I own, are very knowing; But are rum, gin, brandy, worth a pin, Compared with Inishowen? III Though here with a Lord, 'tis jolly and fine, To tumble down Lacryma Christi, And over a skin of Italy's wine To get a little misty; Yet not the blood of the Bourdeaux grape, The finest grape-juice going, Nor clammy Constantia, the pride of the Cape, Prefer I to Inishowen. How to woo! Would you woo a young virgin of fifteen years, You must tickle her fancy with Sweets and Dears, Ever toying and playing, and sweetly, sweetly, Sing a love-sonnet and charm her ears— Wittily, prettily, talk her down— Phrase her and praise her, fair or brown— Soothe her and smooth her, And tease her and please her, Ah! touch but her fancy, and all's your own. There's not a Ioy that Life can give, &amp;c. 1 There's not a joy that wine can give like that it takes away, When slight intoxication yields to drunkenness the sway, 'Tis not that youth's smooth cheek its blush surrenders to the nose, But the stomach turns, the forehead burns, and all our pleasure goes. 2 Then the few, who still can keep their chairs amid the smash'd decanters, Who wanton still in witless jokes, and laugh at pointless banters— The magnet of their course is gone—for, let them try to walk, Their legs, they speedily will find as jointless as their talk. 3 Then the mortal hotness of the brain, like hell itself, is burning, It cannot feel, nor dream, nor think—'tis whizzing, blazing, turning— The heavy wel, or port, or rum, has mingled with our tears, And if by chance we're weeping drunk, each drop our cheek-bone sears. 4 Though fun still flow from fluent lips, and jokes confuse our noddles Through midnight hours, while punch our powers insidiously enfuddles, 'Tis but as ivy leaves were worn by Bacchanals of yore, To make them still look fresh and gay while rolling on the floor. 5 Oh! could I walk as I have walk'd, or see as I have seen; Or even roll as I have done on many a carpet green— As port at Highland inn seems sound, all corkish though it be, So would I the Borachio kiss, and get blind drunk with thee. 'Tis in vain to complain. 1 'Tis in vain To complain, In a melancholy strain, Of the days that are gone, and will never come again. Be we gay, While we may, At whatever time of day, Be our locks berry brown, or mottled o'er with gray, Be our locks berry brown, or mottled o'er with gray. 2 We have laughed, We have quaffed, We have raked it fore and aft, But out of pleasure's bowl have not emptied all the draught. Never mind Days behind, But still before the wind, Float after jolly souls, full flasks, and lasses kind, Float after jolly souls, full flasks, and lasses kind. Chanson a Boire. 1 Time and we should swiftly pass; He the hour-glass, we the glass.— Drink! yon beam which shines so bright Soon will sink in starless night: Ere it sink, boys, ere it sink— Drink it dim, boys! drink, drink, drink! 2 Drink before it be too late— Snatch the hour you may from fate; Here alone true wisdom lies, To be merry's to be wise.— Ere ye sink, boys—ere ye sink— Drink ye blind, boys! drink, drink, drink! Song of a Fallen Angel over a Bowl of Rum-Punch. By T. M., Esq. Heap on more coal there, And keep the glass moving, The frost nips my nose, Though my heart glows with loving. Here's the dear creature, No skylights—a bumper; He who leaves heeltaps I vote him a mumper. With hey cow rumble O Whack! populorum, Merrily, merry men, Push round the jorum. What are Heaven's pleasures That so very sweet are? Singing from psalters, In long or short metre. Planked on a wet cloud Without any breeches, Just like the Celtic, Met to make speeches. With hey cow rumble, &amp;c. Wide is the difference, My own boozing bullies, Here the round punch-bowl Heap'd to the full is. Then if some wise one Thinks that up “yonder” Is pleasant as we are, Why—he's in a blunder. With hey cow rumble, &amp;c. [“Let us drink and be merry] “Let us drink and be merry, Dance, laugh, and rejoice, With claret and sherry, Theorbo and sherry. “This changeable world To our joys is unjust; All pleasure's uncertain, So down with your dust. “In pleasure dispose Your pounds, shillings, and pence, For we all shall be nothing A hundred years hence.” An Hundred Years Hence. I “Let us drink and be merry, Dance, joke, and rejoice, With claret and sherry, Theorbo and voice.” So sings the old song, And a good one it is; Few better were written, From that day to this: And I hope I may say it, And give no offence, Few more will be better, An hundred years hence. II In this year eighteen hundred And twenty and two, There are plenty of false ones And plenty of true. There are brave men and cowards; And bright men and asses; There are lemon-faced prudes; There are kind-hearted lasses. He who quarrels with this Is a man of no sense, For so 'twill continue An hundred years hence. III There are people who rave Of the national debt, Let them pay off their own And the nation's forget; Others bawl for reform, Which were easily done, If each would resolve To reform Number One; For my part to wisdom I make no pretence, I'll be as wise as my neighbors An hundred years hence. IV I only rejoice, that My life has been cast On the gallant and glorious Bright days which we've past; When the flag of Old England Waved lordly in pride, Wherever green Ocean Spreads his murmuring tide: And I pray that unbroken Her watery fence May still keep off invaders, An hundred years hence. V I rejoice that I saw her Triumphant in war, At sublime Waterloo, At dear-bought Trafalgar; On sea and on land, Wheresoever she fought, Trampling Jacobin tyrants And slaves as she ought: Of Church and of King Still the firmest defence:— So may she continue An hundred years hence. VI Whey then need I grieve, if Some people there be, Who, foes to their country, Rejoice not with me; Sure I know in my heart, That Whigs ever have been Tyrannic, or turnspit, Malignant, or mean: They were and are scoundrels In every sense, And scoundrels they will be An hundred years hence. VII So let us be jolly, Why need we repine? If grief is a folly, Let's drown it in wine! As they scared away fiends By the ring of a bell, So the ring of the glass Shall blue devils expel: With a bumper before us The night we'll commence By toasting true Tories An hundred years hence. A Dozen Years Hence. I “Let's drink and be merry, Dance, sing, and rejoice,”— So runs the old carol, “With music and voice.” Had the Bard but survived Till the year thirty-three, Methinks he'd have met with Less matter for glee; To think what we were In our days of good sense, And think what we shall be A dozen years hence. II O! once the wide Continent Rang with our fame, And nations grew still At the sound of our name; The pride of Old Ocean, The home of the free, The scourge of the despot, By shore and by sea, Of the fallen and the feeble The stay and defence— But where shall our fame be A dozen years hence? III The peace and the plenty That spread, over all Blithe hearts and bright faces In hamlet or hall; Our yeomen so loyal In greenwood or plain, Our true-hearted burghers We seek them in vain; For Loyalty's now In the pluperfect tense, And freedom's the word For a dozen years hence. IV The Nobles of Britain, Once foremost to wield Her wisdom in council, Her thunder in field, Her Judges, where learning With purity vied, Her sound-headed Churchmen, Time-honour'd, and tried; To the gift of the prophet I make no pretence, But where shall they all be A dozen years hence? V Alas! for old Reverence, Faded and flown; Alas! for the Nobles, The Church, and the Throne, When to Radical creeds, Peer and Prince must conform, And Catholics dictate Our new Church Reform; While the schoolmaster swears 'Tis a useless expense, Which his class won't put up with A dozen years hence. VI Perhaps twere too much To rejoice at the thought, That its authors will share In the ruin they wrought; That the tempest which sweeps All their betters away, Will hardly spare Durham, Or Russell, or Grey: For my part I bear them No malice prepense, But I'll scarce break my heart for't, A dozen years hence. VII When Cobbett shall rule Our finances alone, And settle all debts As he settled his own; When Hume shall take charge Of the National Church, And leave his old tools, Like the Greeks, in the lurch! They may yet live to see The new era commence, With their own “Final Measure,” A dozen years hence. VIII Already those excellent Friends of the mob, May taste the first fruits Of their Jacobin Job; Since each braying jackass That handles a quill, Now flings up his heels At the poor dying Bill; And comparing already The kicks with the pence, Let them think of the balance A dozen years hence. IX When prisons give place To the swift guillotine, And scaffolds are streaming Where churches have been; We too, or our children, Believe me, will shake Our heads—if we have them— To find our mistake; To find the great measure Was all a pretence, And be sadder and wiser A dozen years hence. The Pewter Quart. A NEW SONG TO AN OLD TUNE—WRITTEN AND COMPOSED FOR THE JOLLIFICATION OF BIBBERS OF BEER, PORTER, ALE, STOUT, NAPPY, AND ALL OTHER CONFIGURATIONS OF MALT AND HOP. Preface to the Reader, which serves also for Invocation. Gentle Reader! Poets there were, in ages back, Who sung the fame of the bonny Black Iack; Others tuned harmonious lans In the Leathern Bottle's praise; Shall not I then lift my quill, To hymn a measure brighter still? Maidens, who Helicon's hill resort, Aid me to chaunt of the Pewter Quart. 2. As for the glass, though I love it well, Yet the quart I take to be prefera—ble; For it is solid and stout, like what Bubbles and froths inside the pot: Why should anything, brittle or frail, Fence England's liquor, valorous ale! He was a man of taste and art, Who stowed it away in a Pewter Quart. 3. In the bowels of England's ground, Its materials all are found, From its sides should flow again, What cheers the bowels of England's men: Can the same be said, I ask, In favour of foreign flagon or flask? None can of them the good report, We can of our national Pewter Quart. 4. Pleasant it is their shine to see, Like stars in the waves of deep Galilee; Pleasant it is their chink to hear, When they rattle on table full charged with beer; Pleasant it is, when a row's on foot, That you may, when you wish to demolish a brute, Politely the man to good manners exhort, By softening his skull with a Pewter Quart. 5. As for the mallet-pate, pig-eye Chinese, They may make crockery if they please; Fit, perhaps, may such vehicle be, For marrowless washes of curst Bohea; That is a liquor I leave to be drunk By Cockney poet and Cockney punk; Folks with whom I never consort, Preferring to chat with my Pewter Quart. 6. Silver and gold no doubt are fine, But on my table shall never shine; Being a man of plain common sense, I hate all silly and vain expense, And spend the cash these gew-gaws cost, In washing down gobbets of boiled and roast, With stingo stiff of the stiffest sort, Curiously pulled from a Pewter Quart. 7. Bakers and bowls, I am told, of wood, For quaffing water are counted good; They give a smack, say the wat'ry folks, Like drinking after artichokes, Devil may care! I never use Water in either my belly or shoes; And shall never be counted art or part In putting the same in a Pewter Quart. 8. Galvani one day, skinning a frog, To pamper his paunch with that pinch-gut prog, Found out a science of wonderful wit, Which can make a stuck pig kick out in a fit. Make a dead thief dance a Highland reel, And butcher a beast without cleaver or steel: And he proves by this science with erudite art, That malt must be drunk from a Pewter Quart. 9. If Hock then loves the glass of green, And champagne in its swan-necked flask is seen; If Glasgow punch in a bowel we lay, And twist off our dram in a wooden quaigh; If, as botanical men admit, Everything has its habitat fit, Let Sir John Barleycorn keep his court, Turban'd with froth in his Pewter Quart. 10. So, boy, take this handful of brass, Across to the Goose and Gridiron pass, Count the coin on the counter out, And bring me a quart of foaming stout; Put it not into bottle or jug, Cannikin, rumkin, flagon, or mug— Into nothing at all, in short, Except the natural Pewter Quart. The Leather Bottle. Now God above, that made all things, Heaven and earth, and all therein; The ships upon the seas to swim, To keep foes out, then come not in. Now every one doth what he can All for the use and praise of man. I wish in Heaven that soul man dwell That first devised the leathern bottle. [Now, what do you say to the canns of wood?] Now, what do you say to the canns of wood? Faith, they are nought, they cannot be good; When a man for beer he doth therein send, To have them filled, as he doth intend: The bearer stumbleth by the way, And on the ground his liquor doth lay; Then straight the man begins to ban, And swears it, 'twas long of the wooden can; But had it been in a leathern bottle, Although he stumbled, all had been well; So safe therein it would remain, Until the man got up again. And I wish in heaven, &amp;c. [Now for the pots with handles three] Now for the pots with handles three, Faith, then shall have no praise of me, When a man and his wife do fall at strife, (As many, I fear, have done in their life,) They lay their hands upon the pot both, And break the same, though they were loth; Which they shall answer another day, For casting their liquor so vainly away: But had it been in a bottle filled, The one might have tugged, the other have held; Then both might have tugged till their hearts did ake, And yet no harm the bottle would take. And I wish in heaven, &amp;c. [Now what of the flagons of silver fine?] Now what of the flagons of silver fine? Faith, they shall have no praise of mine. When a nobleman he doth them send To have them filled, as he doth intend, The man with his flagon runs quite away, And never is seen again after that day. Oh, then his lord begins to ban, And swears he hath lost both flagon and man: But it ne'er was known that page or groom, But with a leathern bottle again would come. And I wish in heaven, &amp;c. [Of tilting furniture, emblazoned shields] Of tilting furniture, emblazoned shields, Impresses quaint, caparisons and steeds, Bases and tinsel trappings, gorgeous knights, At till and tournament; then marshall'd feast, Served up in hall with sewers and seneschals. [Now, what do you say to these glasses fine?] Now, what do you say to these glasses fine? Faith, they shall have no praise of mine, When friends are at a table set, And by them several sorts of meat, The one loves flesh, the other fish; Among them all remove a dish; Touch but a glass upon the brim, The glass is broke; no wine left in: Then be your table-cloth ne'er so fine. There lies your beer, your ale, your wine; And, doubtless, for so small abuse, A young man may his service lose. And I wish, &amp;c. [Now when this bottle is grown old] Now when this bottle is grown old And that it will no longer hold, Out of the side you may cut a clout, To mend your shoe when worn out; Or hang the other side on a pin, 'Twill serve to put many odd trifles in, As nails, awls, and candles' ends; For young beginners need such things. I wish in Heaven his soul man dwell That first invented the Leathern Bottle. ['Tis a pitiful thing, that now-a-days, sirs] 'Tis a pitiful thing, that now-a-days, sirs, Our poets turn Leathern Bottle praisers; But if a leathern theam they did lack, They might better have chosen the bonny Black Iack; For when they are both now well worn and decayed, For the Iack, than the bottle, much more can be said. And I wish his soul much good may partake, That first devised the bonny Black Iack. [And now I will begin to declare] And now I will begin to declare What the conveniences of the Iack are. First, when a gang of good fellows do meet, As oft at a fair, or a wake, you shall see't; They resolve to have some merry carouses, And yet to get home in good time to their houses; Then the bottle it runs as slow as my rhime, With Iack, they might have all been drunk in good time. And I wish his soul in peace may dwell, That first devised that speedy vessel. [And therefore leave your twittle twattle] And therefore leave your twittle twattle, Praise the Iack, praise no more the Leathern Bottle; For the man at the bottle may drink till he burst, And yet not handsomely quench his thirst: The master hereat maketh great moan, And doubts his bottle has a spice of the stone; But if it had been a generous Iack, He might have had currently what he did lack: And I wish his soul in Paradise, That first found out that happy device. [Be your liquor small, or thick as mud] Be your liquor small, or thick as mud, The cheating bottle that cries good, good; Then the master again begins to storm, Because it said more than it could perform: But if it had been in an honest Black Iack, It would have proved better to sight, smell, and smack; And I wish his soul in Heaven may rest, That added a Iack to Bacchus's feast. [No flagon, tankard, bottle, or iug] No flagon, tankard, bottle, or iug, Is half so fit, or so well can hold tug; For when a man and his wife play at thwacks, There is nothing so good as a pair of Black Iacks: Thus to it they go, they swear, and they curse, It makes them both better, the Iack's ne'er the worse; For they might have banged both, till their hearts did ake, And yet no hurt the Iacks could take: And I wish his heirs may have a pension, That first produced that lucky invention. [Socrates and Aristotle] Socrates and Aristotle Sucked no wit from a Leather Bottle; For surely I think a man as soon may Find a needle in a bottle of hay: But if the Black Iack a man often toss over, 'Twill make him as drunk as any philosopher; When he that makes Iacks from a peck to a quart, Conjures not, though he lives by the black art. And I wish, &amp;c. [Besides, my good friend, let me tell you, that fellow] Besides, my good friend, let me tell you, that fellow That framed the bottle, his brains were but shallow; The case is so clear, I nothing need mention, The Iack is a nearer and deeper invention; When the bottle is cleaned, the dregs fly about, As if the guts and the brains flew out; But if in a cannon-bore Iack it had been, From the top to the bottom all might have been clean. And I wish his soul no comfort man lack, That first devised the bouncing Black Iack. [Your leathèr bottle is used by no man] Your leathèr bottle is used by no man That is a hair's-breadth above a plowman; Then let us gang to the Hercules pillars, And there let us visit those gallant Iack swillers; In these small, strong, sour, mild, and stale, They drink orange, lemon, and Lambeth ale: The chief of heralds there allows, The Iack to be of an ancienter house. And may his successors never want sack, That first devised the long Leather Iack. Then for the bottle, you cannot well fill it, Without a tunnel, but that you must spill it; 'Tis as hard to get in, as it is to get out, 'Tis not so with a Iack, for it runs like a spout Then burn your bottle, what good is in it, One cannot well fill it, nor drink nor clean it; But if it had been in a jolly Black Iack, 'Twould come a great pace, and hold you good tack. And I wish his soul, &amp;c. He that's drunk in a Iack, looks as fierce as a spark, That were just ready cockt to shoot at a mark; When the other thing up to the mouth it goes, Makes a man look with a great bottle nose; All wise men conclude, that a Iack, new or old, Tho' beginning to leak, is however worth gold; For when the poor man on the way does trudge it, His worn-out Iack serves him for a budget. And I wish his heirs may never lack sack, That first contrived the leather Black Iack. When bottle and Iack stand together, fie on't, The bottle looks just like a dwarf to a giant; Then have we not reason the Iack for to choose, For they can make boots, when the bottle mends shoes; For add but to every Iack a foot, And every Iack becomes a boot: Then give me my Iack, there's a reason why, They have kept us wet, they will keep us dry. I now shall cease, but as I am an honest man, The Iack deserves to be called Sir John. And may they ne'er want, for belly nor back, That keep up the trade of the bonny Black Iack. An Idyl on the Battle. Fists and the man I sing, who, in the valleys of Hampshire, Close to the borough of Andover, one fine day of the spring-time, Being the twentieth of May, (the day, moreover, was Tuesday,) Eighteen hundred and twenty-three, in a fistical combat, Beat, in a handful of rounds, Bill Neat, the butcher of Bristol. What is the hero's name? Indeed, 'tis bootless to mention. Every one knows 'tis Spring—Tom Spring, now Champion of England. Full of honours and gout, Tom Cribb surrendered his kingdom, And in the Champion's cup no more he quaffs as the Champion. Who is to fill his place? the anxious nation, inquiring, Looks round the ring with a glance of hope and eagerness blended. Everywhere would you see deep-drawn and puckered-up faces, Worn by the people in thought on this high and ponderous matter. Spain and Greece are forgot—they may box it about at their pleasure; Newport may brandish his brogue unheard at the Sheriff of Dublin; Canning may give the lie to Brougham, and Brougham be a Christian; Hume may be puffing Carlile, or waging a war upon Cocker; Byron may write a poem, and Hazlitt a Liber Amoris; Nobody cares a fig for the Balaam of Baron or Cockney. All were absorbed at once in the one profound speculation, Who was the man to be the new pugilistical Dymoke. Neat and the Gasman put up, and the light of Gas was extinguished. Woe is my heart for Gas! accursed be the wheel of the waggon Which made a pancake of blood of the head of that elegant fellow. He had no chance with Neat; the fist of that brawny Bristolian Laid him in full defeat on the downs of Hungerford prostrate. Great was the fame of Bill; the ancient city of Bristol [Bristol, the birth-place dear of the Laureate LL.D. Southey— Bristol, the birth-place too of Thomas Cribb the ex-Champion] Hailed him with greetings loud; and, boldly declaring him matchless, Challenged the boxing world to try his valour in contest. London replied to the call—the land of the Cockneys, indignant At this yokel attempt to set up a Champion provincial, Looked with its great big eyes at Spring, and Spring understood it, Everything soon was arranged; the time was fixed for the battle; Cash on each side was posted, a cool two hundred of sovereigns; And the affair was put beneath the guidance of Jackson. I sha'n't delay my song to say, how some Justices tasteless Twice by the felon hand of power prevented the combat. Vain the attempt as base—as well the clashing of comets Would be prevented by them, as the onslaught of pugilist rivals. When the great day arrived, big with the glory of Britain, Bustle be sure there was, and riding, and running, and racing; Nay, for three days before, the roads were wofully crowded; All the inns were beset, each bed had a previous engagement; So, if you came in late, you were left in a bit of a hobble— Either to camp in the street, or sleep on three chairs in the bar-room. Chaises, coaches, barouches, taxed carts, tilburies, whiskeys, Curricles, shandry-dans, gigs, tall phaetons, jaunting cars, waggons, Cabriolets, landaus, all sorts of vehicles rolling, Four-wheeled, or two-wheeled, drawn by one, two, three, or four horses; Steeds of various degrees, high-mettled racer, or hunter, Bit of blood, skin-and-boner, pad, hack, mule, jackass, or donkey; Sniffers on foot in droves, by choice or economy prompted; Grumbling Radical, pickpocket Whig, and gentleman Tory, Down from ducal rank to the rascally fisher of fogles, Poured from London town to see the wonderful action. Thirty thousand at least were there; and ladies in numbers Rained from their beautiful eyes sweet influence over the buffers. Well the ground was chosen, and quite with the eye of a poet; Close to the field of fight, the land all rises around it, Amphitheatrical wise, in a most judgmatical fashion. There had the Johnny-raws of Hants ta'en places at leisure, Many an hour before the combatants came to the turn-up. We were not idle, be sure, although we waited in patience; Drink of all sorts and shapes was kindly provided to cheer us; Ales from the famous towns of Burton, Marlboro', Taunton; Porter from lordly Thames, and beer of various descriptions; Brandy of Gallic growth, and rum from the isle of Jamaica; Deady, and heavy wet, blue ruin, max, and Geneva; Hollands that ne'er saw Holland, mum, brown stout, perry, and cyder; Spirits in all ways prepared, stark-naked, hot or cold watered; Negus, or godlike grog, flip, lambswool, syllabub, rumbo; Toddy, or punch, or shrub, or the much sung stingo of gin-twist; Wines, in proportions less, their radiance intermingling. Flowed like a stream round the ring, refreshing the dry population. Glad was I in my soul, though I missed my national liquor, And with a tear in my eye my heart fled back into Ireland. Whiskey, my jewel dear, what though I have chosen a dwelling Far away, and my throat is now-a-days moistened by Hodges,— Drink of my early days, I swear I shall never forget thee! Round the ring we sat, the stiff stuff tipsily quaffing. [Thanks be to thee, Jack Keats; our thanks for the dactyl and spondee Pestleman Jack, whom, according to Shelley, the Quarterly murdered With a critique as fell as one of his own patent medicines.] Gibbons appeared at last; and, with adjutants versed in the business, Drove in the stakes and roped them. The hawbuck Hottentot Hantsmen Felt an objection to be whipped out of the ring by the Gibbons. Fight was accordingly shewn, and Bill, afraid of the numbers, Kept his whip in peace, awaiting the coming of Jackson. Soon did his eloquent tongue tip off the blarney among them; And what force could not do, soft talk performed in a jiffy. Arm-in-arm with his backer and Belcher, followed by Harmer, Neat in a moment appeared, and instantly flung down his castor. In about ten minutes more, came Spring, attended by Painter; Cribb, the illustrious Cribb, however, acted as second. Compliments, then, were exchanged, hands shaken, after the fashion Of merry England for ever, the beef-eating land of the John Bulls. Blue as the arch of Heaven, or the much-loved eyes of my darling, Was the colour of Spring—to the stakes Cribb tied it in person. Yellow, like Severn streams, when the might of rain has descended, Shone forth the kerchief of Neat. Tom Belcher tied it above Spring's— But with a delicate twist, Tom Cribb reversed the arrangement, Putting the blue above. The men then peeled for the onset. Twenty minutes past One P.M.—So far for a preface. Round the First. Spring was a model of manhood. Chantrey, Canova, or Scoular, Graved not a finer form; his muscles firmly were filled up, And with elastic vigour played all over his corpus; Fine did his deltoid show; his neck rose towering gently Curved from the shoulder broad; his back was lightsomely dropt in. Over his cuticle spread a slightly ruddy suffusion, Shewing his excellent state, and the famous care of his trainers; Confidence beamed from his face; his eye shone steady in valour. Valiantly, too, looked Neat, a truly respectable butcher, But o'er his skin the flush was but in irregular patches: Even on his cheeks, the bloom was scarce the breadth of a dollar. Gin, thou wert plainly there! I would he had left thee to Hazlitt, Ay, or to any one else, all during the process of training! Bootless 'tis now to complain—Bill Neat, you were bothered by Daffy! Long did they pause ere they hit—much cautious dodging and guarding Shewed their respect for each other; four tedious minutes, ere either Struck, had elapsed; at last Tom Spring hit out with the left hand, So did Bill Neat with the right, but neither blow did the business, Neat then made up for offence, and flung out a jolly right-hander, Full for the stomach of Spring; but Spring judiciously stopped it, Else it had flattened the lad as flat as the flattest of flounders: Even as it was, it contused the fleshy part of his fore-arm. Neat tried the business again—'twas now more happily parried. Spring, with a smile at the thought of the smash he had given to Bill's fist, Put down his hands for a while, but soon gathered up to the onset; Hit and re-hit now passed, but Neat threw off a right-hander Meant for certain effect. The true scientifical manner Shewn by William in this was loftily cheered by the audience, Thunders of clapping ensued, and the whole ring roared like a bullock, Neat grew offensive now, but the stop and parry of Winter [Winter is Spring's real name, though they call him, for brevity, Tom Spring.] Punished him step by step, as Bill drove him into the corner. “Now is the time,” cried Belcher, and Bristol waited the triumph, But the position of Spring prevented all awkward invasion. In-fighting then was tried, that came to a close and a struggle: Under came Billy Neat, as Ajax under Ulysses. Spring came over him hard—and 3 to 2 was the betting. Round the Second. Spring shewed the same strong guard, but ever ready for action. Neat began to breathe short, when, wap! came a flushy right-hander, Plump on his fore-head, and, lo! the stream of the claret was flowing, Sanguine as butchers will bleed, not at all like the ichor of angels. Out did he hit to the right—Spring sprung back—Neat again tried it, But, on the side of the head, he got such a lump of a twister, That he was turned quite round, and nearly saluted his mother. Stupid and senseless he looked like a young whig lawyer of Embro'— (Some little mealy-faced pup, amazed with a recent suffusion From the uplisted leg of some big boardly bull-dog of Blackwood)— Then did the hooting arise, from various people indignant; And, in the hubbub loud, “Cross, Cross!” was frequently mentioned. This brought Neat to his senses, and straight he took to in-fighting. Bloody hard hits came from both—'twas head-work chiefly between them: Down in the end went Neat, and blue looked the betters of Bristol! Round the Third. Neat tried his hand at hard hitting—and then were the heavy exchanges. But in one counter-hit, his blow was heavier than Tommy's, For it sent him away. Bill Neat then burst out a-laughing, Like the Olympian Gods at Vulcan handing the stingo. He followed up his success; and after ringing the changes, Planted a terrible lunge on the short-rib department of Thomas. Then he gave all his weight to a blow, and floored his opponent, Coming down with him himself. On this, a terrible uproar Rose from the Men of the West—a shout of jubilant cheering. Short is the vision of man! that very round had undone him, For, in the counter-hit, he broke a bone in his fore-arm. What is the name of the bone?—Well, since you ask me the question, Radius, 'tis called by Cline, a most anatomical surgeon. Round the Fourth. Firm was the guard of Spring; Neat worked most anxious to get in— Vainly—for Spring baffled all his attempts, just as if he was sparring. Soon he took the offensive, and the woful yokels of Avon Heard his fists, right and left, rap! rap! on the body of Billy. One—two nobbers, besides, did he administer freely; All the while poor Bill felt out for the ribs with the left hand; Every hit being short, and the right hand quite ineffective: Backward and forward jumped Spring, and grasping his burly opponent, Caught him up from the ground, and fell down fairly upon him. Glorious! sublime was the feat, and there was no saying against it. Bristol looked very blank, as blank as the Island of Byron. Loud did the Westerns cry, “Bill, what has become of your right hand? Gemini, man! My eyes! Hey! Go it! What are you arter?” Betting was 5 to 1.—In fact, Bill Neat was defeated. Rounds Fifth and Sixth. Lump we a couple of rounds, for I'm in a devilish hurry, Being invited to dine at the Dog and Duck with Pierce Egan Neat was quite stupified now, a mere Phrenological fellow, Who, as we happen to know, can not tell a man's head from a turnip. All his hits were at random; on getting a bodier slanting, Down he'd have gone for time, but Spring, with the kindest intentions, Lent him a merry-go-down, to freshen his way in the tumble. Murmurs then were of foul play, as if he had fallen out of fancy Without the aid of a hit; but Jackson, unerring as Delphi, Stated the fact as it was, and decision dwelt on his dictate. As for round the sixth, 'tis hardly worth the relating. Neat was pelted about, and knocked down like a cow in the shambles. Round the Seventh. Still there was pluck in Bill; Spring feared a customer rummish. Cautiously, therefore, he fought and parried the sinister lunges. One, however, took place on the right lower ribs of the hero, Whereon he sparred for a hit, which he planted with ease and affection, Right on the brain-box of Neat, who, though not given to praying, Sunk on his marrow-bones straight, in a fashion godly and pious. Instantly rose a shout, a riff-raff-ruffianly roaring, Hallabulloo immense, a most voluminous volley; Cockneyland crowed like a cock, and the hills gave an echo politely. Round Eight and Last. Neat came up once more, but the fight was over; again he Hit with the dexter arm, and felt that he now was defeated. Spring in a moment put in a ramstam belly-go fister— Down to the ground went Neat, and with him down went the battle. “It is no use,” said Bill; “my arm, do you see me, is injured— Therefore I must give in.” He spoke—and, mournfully placing On the sore part his hand, he shewed the fracture to Tom Spring. Seven-and-thirty minutes it lasted—ten of them wasted In the first round alone. The glorious news came to London Somewhere about eight o'clock; but still incredulous people Held the report as false; and, even approaching to midnight, Bets were laid on Neat—so much was Spring undervalued. Woe was in Bristol town—woe, woe on the Severn and Avon; Cliston, the seat of the gay, looked dull and awfully gloomy; Grief was in Bath the polite; a mournful air of dejection Reigned o'er the tables of whist; and mugs, as fair as the morning, Looked like the ten of spades, or the face of my Lord Grim-Grizzle. Round the old Redcliff church was held an aggregate meeting, Stormy and sad by fits—where some, with sceptical speeches, Doubted the fact of the case—or, cunningly crooking the fingers, Made a X in the open air, affronting the moon-beams; Others but shook the head, and jingled the coin in their pockets, Cheering themselves with the much-loved sound of the gold for the last time. But in the shambles of Bristol, among the butcherly people, There was the blackness of sorrow; loud oaths, or sorrowful moaning, Rung in the seat of slaughter—but slaughter now was suspended; Mute was the marrow-bone now, the ancient music of Britain; Cleaver, and bloody axe, steel, hand-saw, chopping-block, hatchet, Lay in a grim repose; and the hungry people of Bristol Could not the following day get a single joint for their dinner. But when the cross was suggested, the whole black body of butchers Raged, like a troubled sea, with a wild and mutinous uproar. Such was the state of the West. Meanwhile Spring travelled to London, There to be hailed as the Champion bold of merry Old England. Neat he saw in bed—his arm was fastened with splinters— And in the heel of his fist Tom nobly inserted some shiners. Bill was sulky, however; and still he lustily vaunted, That, if his arm had not broke, he must have been hailed as the Champion— That can be known, however, to the Fates and Jupiter only. Where are the chaffers now, who swore that Spring was no hitter? That he could scarce make a dint in a pound or a half-pound of butter?— Melted all fast away, like the butter of which they were speaking. Long live the Champion Spring! and may his glorious annals Shine in the pages of Egan as bright as the record of Tom Cribb! One man more must be fought, however;—Arise to the combat, Rise for the Champion's crown, arise, I say, Joshua Hudson! That will be the fight—meanwhile Spring lords the ascendant; Therefore huzza for Spring—and I make my bow to the public. [“To-morrow for fresh fights and pastures new.”] —Milton. M. OD. LAMENT OF A BIG BRISTOL BUTCHER. 1 I was as raw as butcher's meat, I was as green as cabbage, When I sported blunt on Billy Neat, The ugly-looking savage. 2 I was as dull as Bristol stone, And as the Severn muddy, Or I should have had the humbug known, Of that big bruiser bloody. 3 I was as dull as a chopping-block, As stupid as a jack-ass, Or I'd not have laid on such a cock One whiff of my tobaccoes. 4 For budding flower, or leafing tree, I now don't care a splinter; For Spring is a colder thought to me Than the bitterest day of Winter. 5 Woe, woe unto the market-place! Woe, woe among the cleavers! For sad is every greasy face Among Bill Neat's believers. 6 I'm rooked of notes both small and great, I'm rooked of every sovereign; So bloody curses on Bill Neat, Whatever king may govern! A Twist-imony in Favour of Gin-Twist. An humble imitation of that admirable Poem, the Ex-ale-tation of Ale, attributed by grave authors to Bishop Andrews, on which point is to be consulted, Francis, Lord Verulam, a celebrated Philosopher, who has been lately bescoped-and tendencied by Macvey Napier, Esq. Running Index of Matters. 1 At one in the morn, as I went staggering home, Proœm. With nothing at all in my hand, but my fist, At the end of the street, a good youth I did meet Who ask'd me to join in a jug of gin-twist. 2 “Though 'tis late,” I replied, “and I'm muggy beside, Gin-twist. Yet, an offer like this I could never resist; So let's waddle away, sans a moment's delay, And in style we'll demolish your jug of gin-twist.” 3 The friends of the grape, may boast of rich Cape, Wines. Hock, Claret, Madeira, or Lachryma Christ, But this muzzle of mine was never so fine, As to value them more than a jug of gin-twist. 4 The people of Nantz, in the Kingdom of France, Brandy. Bright brandy they brew, liquor not to be hiss'd; It may do as a dram, but, 'tis not worth a damn, When water'd, compared with a jug of gin-twist. 5 Antigua, Jamaica,—they certainly make a Rum. Grand species of rum, which should ne'er be dismiss'd; It is splendid as grog, but never, you dog, Esteem it as punch, like a jug of gin-twist. 6 Cold punchYe Bailies of Glasgow! Wise men of the West! Without your rum bowls, you'd look certainly tristes; Yet I laugh when I'm told, that liquor so cold Is as good as a foaming hot jug of gin-twist. 7 PotsheenThe bog-trotting Teagues, in clear whiskey delight, Preferring potsheen to all drinks that exist; I grieve, ne'ertheless, that it does not possess The juniper smack of a jug of gin-twist. 8 FarintoshFarintosh and Glenlivit, I hear, are the boast Of those breechesless heroes, the Sons of the Mist; But, may I go choke, if that villainous smoke I'd name in a day with a jug of gin-twist. 9 The CelticYet the Celtic I love, and should join them, by Jove! Though Glengarry should vow I'd no right to enlist; For that Chief, do you see, I'd not care a bawbee, If strongly entrench'd o'er a jug of gin-twist. 10 KiltsOne rule they lay down is the reason, I own, Why from joining their plaided array I desist; Because they declare, that no one shall wear Of breeches a pair, o'er their jugs of gin-twist. 11 BreechesThis is plainly absurd, I give you my word, Of this bare-rump'd reg'lation I ne'er saw the gist; In my gay corduroys, can't these philabeg boys Suffer me to get drunk o'er my jug of gin-twist? 12 RackIn India they smack a liquor call'd rack, Which I never quaff'd, (at least that I wist;) I'm told 'tis like tow in its taste, and so, Very different stuff from a jug of gin-twist. 13 Porter and AleAs for porter and ale—'fore Gad, I turn pale, When people on such things as these can insist; They may do for dull clods, but, by all of the gods! They are hog-wash when match'd with a jug of gin-twist, 14 Why tea we import, I could never conceive; Tea. To the mandarin folk, to be sure, it brings grist; But in our western soils, the spirits it spoils, While to heaven they are raised by a jug of gin-twist. 15 Look at Hazlitt and Hunt, most unfortunate pair! Hazlit, Hunt, Bohea. Z Black and blue from the kicks of a stern satirist; But would Mynheer Izzard once trouble their gizzard, If bohea they exchanged for a jug of gin-twist? 16 Leibnitz held that this earth was the first of all worlds, Leibnitz. And no wonder the buck was a firm optimist; For 'twas always his use, as a proof to adduce, Of the truth of his doctrine, a jug of gin-twist. 17 It cures all the vapours and mulligrub capers; Howard. It makes you like Howard, the philanthro-pist; Woe, trouble, and pain, that bother your brain, Are banish'd out clean, by a jug of gin-twist. 18 You turn up your nose at all your foes, Law of libel. Abuse you, traduce you, they may if they list: The lawyers, I'm sure, would look very poor, If their clients would stick to their jugs of gin-twist. 19 There's Leslie, my friend, who went ramstam to law, Mr. Leslie and Dr. Olinthus Petre. Because Petre had styled him a poor Hebraist; And you see how the Jury, in spite of his fury, Gave him comfort far less than one jug of gin-twist. 20 And therefore, I guess, Sir, the celebre Professor, Leslie and Kit North. Even though culpably quizz'd as a mere sciolist, Would have found it much meeter, to have laugh'd at old Petre, And got drunk with Kit North o'er a jug of gin-twist. 21 Stranguary.Its medical virtues ? ? a jug of gin-twist. 22 Brockden Brown.By its magical aid, a toper is made, Like Brockden Brown's hero, a ventriloquist; For my belly cries out, with an audible shout, “Fill up every chink with a jug of gin-twist.” 23 Cosmogony.Geologers all, great, middling, and small, Whether fiery Plutonian or wet Neptunist, Most gladly, it seems, seek proofs for their schemes, In the water, or spirit, of a jug of gin-twist. 24 Geology.These grubbers of ground, (whom God may confound!) Forgetting transition, trap, hornblende, or schist, And all other sorts, think only of quartz— I mean, of the quarts in a jug of gin-twist. 25 Parnassus.Though two dozen of verse I've contriv'd to rehearse, Yet still I can sing like a true melodist; For they are but asses, who think that Parnassus In spirit surpasses a jug of gin-twist. 26 The Massora.It makes you to speak Dutch, Latin, or Greek; Even learning Chinese very much 'twould assist: I'll discourse you in Hebrew, provided that ye brew A most Massorethical jug of gin-twist. 27 The Picturesque.When its amiable stream, all enveloped in steam, Is dash'd to and fro by a vigorous wrist, How sweet a cascade every moment is made By the artist who fashions a jug of gin-twist! 28 Whiggery.Sweet stream! there is none but delights in thy flow, Save that vagabond villain, the Whig atheist; For done was the job for his patron, Sir Bob, When he dared to wage war 'gainst a jug of gin-twist. 29 Don't think, by its name, from Geneva it came, John Calvin. The sour little source of the Kirk Calvinist— A fig for Jack Calvin, my processes alvine Are much more rejoiced by a jug of gin-twist. 30 Let the Scotsman delight in malice and spite, Michael Angelo Taylor, Esq., M. P., &amp;c. The black-legs at Brooke's, in hazard or whist; Tom Dibdin in books—Micky Taylor in cooks, My pleasure is fixed in a jug of gin-twist. 31 Though the point of my nose grow as red as a rose, Precious stones. Or rival in hue a superb amethyst, Yet no matter for that, I tell you 'tis flat, I shall still take a pull at a jug of gin-twist. 32 There was old Cleobulus, who meaning to fool us, Wise Men of Greece. Gave out for his saying, to metpon apist'; But he'd never keep measure, if he had but the pleasure Of washing his throat with a jug of gin-twist. 33 Kisses.There are dandies and blockheads, who vapour and boast Of the favours of girls they never have kiss'd; That is not the thing, and therefore by jing! I kiss while I'm praising my jug of gin-twist. 34 PlatoWhile over the glass, I should be an ass, To make moping love like a dull Platonist; That ne'er was my fashion, I swear that my passion In as hot as itself for a jug of gin-twist. 35 ??????? ???????.Although it is time to finish my rhyme, Yet the subject's so sweet, I can scarcely desist; While its grateful perfume is delighting the room, How can I be mute o'er a jug of gin-twist? 36 God save the King.Yet since I've made out, without any doubt, Of its merits and glories a flourishing list, Let us end with a toast, which we cherish the most, Here's “God save the King!” in a glass of gin-twist. Moral. Then I bade him good night in a most jolly plight, But I'm sorry to say that my footing I missed; All the stairs I fell down, so I batter'd my crown, And got two black eyes from a jug of gin-twist. Cork is the Aiden for you, love, and me. Air—“They may rail at this life.” I They may rail at the city where I was first born, But it's there they've the whiskey, and butter, and pork, An' a nate little spot for to walk in each morn, They calls it Daunt's Square, and the city is Cork! The Square has two sides, why, one east, and one west; And convanient's the ragion of frolic and spree, Where salmon, drisheens, and beef-steaks are cook'd best, Och! Fishamble's the Aiden for you, love, and me. II If you want to behold the sublime and the beauteous, Put your toes in your brogues, and see sweet Blarney Lane, Where the parents and childer is comely and duteous, And “dry lodgin” both rider and beast entertain; In the cellars below dines the slashin' young fellows, What comes with the butter from distant Tralee; While the landlady, chalking the score on the bellows, Sings, Cork is an Aiden for you, love, and me. III Blackpool is another sweet place of that city, Where pigs, twigs, and wavers, they all grow together, With its small little tanyards—och, more is the pity— To trip the poor beasts to convert them to leather! Farther up to the east, is a place great and famous, It is called Mellow Lane—antiquaries agree That it holds the Shibbeen which once held King Shamus:— O! Cork is an Aiden for you, love, and me. IV Then go back to Daunt's Bridge, though you'll think it is quare That you can't see the bridge—faix! you ne'er saw the like Of that bridge, nor of one-sided Buckingham Square, Nor the narrow Broad lane, that leads up to the Dyke! Where turning his wheel sits that Saint “Holy Joe,” And numbrellas are made of the best quality, And young vargints sing “Colleen das croothin a mo” And Cork is an Aiden for you, love, and me. V When you gets to the Dyke, there's a beautiful prospect Of a long gravel walk between two rows of trees; On one side, with a beautiful southern aspect, Is Blair's Castle, that trembles above in the breeze! Far off to the west lies the lakes of Killarney, Which some hills intervening prevents you to see; But you smell the sweet wind from the wild groves of Blarney— Och! Cork is the Aiden for you, love, and me! VI Take the road to Glanmire, the road to Blackrock, or The sweet Boreemannah, to charm your eyes, If you doubt what is Wise, take a dram of Tom Walker, And if you're a Walker, toss off Tommy Wise! I give you my word that they're both lads of spirit; But if a “raw-chaw, ” with your gums don't agree, Beamish, Crawford, and Lane, brew some porter of merit, Tho' Potheen is the nectar for you, love, and me. VII Oh, long life to you, Cork, with your pepper-box steeple, Your girls, your whiskey, your curds, and sweet whey! Your hill of Glanmire, and shops where the people Gets decent new clothes down beyont the Coal Quay. Long life to sweet Fair Lane, its pipers and jigs, And to sweet Sunday's well, and the banks of the Lee, Likewise to your coort-house, where judges in wigs Sing, Cork is an Aiden for you, love, and me! BALLAD ON THE DEATH OF SIMON DE MONTFORT, EARL OF LEICESTER, AT THE BATTLE OF EVERSHAM, 1226. (Literally versified from the Norman French.) BY WALTER SCOTT, ESQ. “In woeful wise my song shall rise, My heart impels the strain; Tears fit the song, which tells the wrong, Of gentle Barons slayn. Fayr peace to gaine they fought in vayn; Their house to ruin gave, And limb and life, to butcheryng knyfe, Our native land to save. CHORUS. Now lowly lies the flower of pries, That could so much of weir: Erle Montfort's scathe, and heavy death, Shall cost the world a tear. “As I here say, upon Tuesdaye, The battle bold was done; Each mounted knight, there fell in fight, For ayd of foot was none: There wounds were felt, and blows were dealt, With brands that burnish'd be, Sir Edward stoute, his numerous route, Have won the maisterie. Now lowly lies, &amp;c. “But, though he died, on Montfort's side The victorie remain'd; Like Becket's fayth, the Erle's in deathe, The martyr's palm obtain'd; That holy Saint would never graunt, The church should fall or slyde; Like him, the Erle met deadly peril, And like him dauntless dyed. Now lowly lies, &amp;c. “The bold Sir Hugh Despencer true, The kingdom's Justice he. Was dom'd to die unrighteouslye, By passynge crueltie; And Sir Henry, the son was he To Leister's nobile lord, With many moe, as ye shall know, Fell by Erle Gloster's sword. Now lowly lies, &amp;c. “He that dares dye, in standing by The country's peace and lawe, To him the Saint the meed shall graunt Of conscience free from flawe. Who suffers scathe, and faces death, To save the poor from wrong, God speed his end, the poor man's friend, For suche we pray, and long! Now lowly lies, &amp;c. “His bosom here, a treasure dere. A sackclothe shirt, they founde; The felons there full ruthless were Who stretched hym on the grounde. More wrongs than be in butcherye, They did the knight who fell, To wield his sword, and keep his worde, Who knew the way so well. Now lowly lies, &amp;c. “Pray as is meet, my brethern sweet, The maiden Mary's son, The infant fair, our noble heir, In grace to guide him on. I will not name the habit's claym, Of that I will not saye; But for Jesus' love, that sits above, For churchmen ever pray. Now lowly lies, &amp;c. “Seek not to see, of chivalrye, Or count, or baron bold; Each gallant knight, and squire of might They all are bought and sold; For loyaltie and veritie, They now are done awaye— The losel vile may reign by guile, The fool by his foleye. Now lowly lies, &amp;c. “Sir Simon wight, that gallant knight, And his companye eche one, To heaven above, and joye and love. And endless life, are gone. May He on rood who bought our good, And God, their paine relieve, Who, captive ta'en, are kept in chaine, And depe in dungeon grieve! “Now lowly lies the flower of pries, That could so much of weir; Erle Montsort's scathe, and heavy death, Shall cost the world a tear.” Lament for Lord Byron. Air—The Last Rose of Summer. Lament for Lord Byron, In full slow of grief, As a sept of Milesians Would mourn o'er their chief! With the loud voice of weeping, With sorrow's deep tone, We shall keen o'er our poet, “All faded and gone.” Though in far Missolunghi His body is laid; Though the hands of the stranger His lone grave have made; Though no foot from Old England Its surface will tread, Nor the sun of Old England Shine over its head; Yet, bard of the Corsair, High-spirited Childe; Thou who sang'st of Lord Manfred The destiny wild! Thou star, whose bright radiance Illumined our verse, Our souls cross the blue seas, To mourn o'er thy hearse. Thy faults and thy follies, Whatever they were, Be their memory dispersed As the winds of the air; No reproaches from me On thy course shall be thrown,— Let the man who is sinless Uplift the first stone. In thy vigor of manhood Small praise from my tongue Had thy fame or thy talents, Or merriment wrung; For that Church, and that State, and That monarch I loved, Which too oft thy hot censure Or rash laughter moved. But I hoped in my bosom That moment would come, When thy feelings would wander Again to their home. For that soul, O last Byron! In brillianter hours, Must have turn'd to its country— Must still have been ours. Now slumber, bright spirit! Thy body, in peace, Sleeps with heroes and sages, And poets of Greece; While thy soul in the tongue of Even greater than they, Is embalme'd till the mountains And seas pass away. Odoherty's Dirge Oh! when I am departed and passed away, Let's have no lamentations or sounds of dismay— Meet together, kind lads, o'er a three-gallon bowl, And so toast the repose of Odoherty's soul. Down, derry down. If my darling girl pass, gently bid her come in, To join the libation she'll think it no sin; Though she choose a new sweetheart, and doff the black gown, She'll remember me kindly when down—down—down— Down, derry down. Drink. When Panurge and his fellows, as Rab'lais will tell us, Set out on a sail to the ends of the earth, And jollily cruising, carousing, and boozing, To the oracle came in a full tide of mirth, Pray what was its answer? come tell if you can, sir; 'Twas an answer most splendid and sage, as I think; For sans any delaying, it summ'd up by saying, The whole duty of man is one syllable—“Drink.” O bottle mirific! advice beatific! A response more celestial sure never was known; I speak for myself, I prefer it to Delphi, Though Apollo himself on that rock fixed his throne; The foplings of fashion may still talk their trash on, And declare that the custom of toping should sink; A fig for such asses, I stick to my glasses, And swear that no fashion shall stint me in drink. And now in full measure I toast you with pleasure, The warrior— —the poet— —the statesman— —and sage; Whose benign constellation illumines the nation, And sheds lively lustre all over the age; Long, long may its brightness, in glory and lightness, Shine clear as the day-star on morning's sweet brink! May their sway ne'er diminish! and therefore I finish, By proposing the health of the four whom I drink. Crambambulee. Crambambulee!—all the world over, Thou'rt mother's milk to Germans true—Tra li ra. No cure like thee can sage discover For colic, love, or devils blue—Tra li ra. Blow hot or cold, from morn to night, My dream is still my soul's delight, Cram-bam-bim-bam-bu-lee!—Crambambulee! Hungry and chill'd with bivouacking, We rise ere song of earliest bird—Tra li ra. Cannon and drums our ears are cracking, And saddle, boot, and blade's the word—Tra li ra. “Vite en l'avant,” our bugle blows, A flying gulp and off it goes, Cram-bam-bim-bam-bu-lee!—Crambambulee! Victory's ours, off speed despatches, Hourra! The luck for once is mine—Tra li ra. Food comes by morsels, sleep by snatches, No time, by Jove, to wash or dine—Tra li ra. From post to post my pipe I cram, Full gallop smoke, and suck my dram. Cram-bam-bim-bam-bu-lee!—Crambambulee When I'm the peer of kings and kaisers, An order of my own I'll found—Tra li ra. Down goes our gage to all despisers, Our motto through the world shall sound—Tra li ra. “Toujours fidele et sans souci, C'est l'ordre de Crambambulee!” Cram-bam-bim-bam-bu-lee!—Crambambulee!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. II Pandemus Polyglott. Sapphics. The Friend of Humanity and the Knifegrinder Friend of Humanity. “Needy Knifegrinder! whither art thou going? Rough is the road; thy wheel is out of order; Bleak blows the blast; your hat has got a hole in't, So have your breeches. “Weary knifegrinder, little know the proud ones, Who in their coaches roll along the turnpike- Road, what hard work 'tis crying all day, ‘Knives and Scissors to grind O.’ “Tell me, Knifegrinder, how came you to grind knives? Did some rich man tyrannically use you? Was it the 'squire? or parson of the parish? Or the attorney? “Was it the 'squire for killing of his game? or Covetous parson for his tithes destraining? Or roguish lawyer made you lose your little All in a lawsuit? “Have you not read the ‘Rights of Man’ by Tom Paine? Drops of compassion tremble on my eyelids, Ready to fall as soon as you have told your Pitiful story.” Knifegrinder. “Story! God bless you? I have none to tell, sir; Only last night a-drinking at the Chequers, This poor old hat and breeches, as you see, were Torn in a scuffle. “Constables came up for to take me into Custody; they took me before the justice; Justice Oldmixon put me in the parish Stocks for a vagrant. “I should be glad to drink your honor's health in A pot of beer, if you will give me sixpence; But for my part I never love to meddle With politics, sir.” Friend of Humanity. “I give thee sixpence! I will see thee damn'd first, Wretch, whom no sense of wrongs can rouse to vengeance; Sordid, unfeeling, reprobate, degraded, Spiritless outcast.” [“Busy, curious, thirsty fly] Written extempore by a Gentleman, occasioned by a fly drinking out of his cup. “Busy, curious, thirsty fly, Drink with me and drink as I; Freely welcome to my cup, Couldst thou sip, and sip it up. Make the most of life you may, Life is short and fades away. “Both alike are mine and thine, Hastening quick to their decline; Thine's a summer, mine no more, Though repeated to threescore. Threescore summers, when they're gone, Will appear as short as one! Young Lady. Child of Earth, With the golden hair! Thy soul is too pure, And thy face too fair, To dwell with creatures Of mortal mould, Whose lips are warm As their hearts are cold. Roam, Roam To our fairy home. Child of Earth, With the golden hair! Thou shalt dance With the Fairy Queen O' summer nights On the moon-lit green, To music murmuring Sweeter far Than ever was heard 'Neath the morning star. Roam, roam, &amp;c. Myself. Shall I wasting in despair, Die because a woman's fair? Or make pale my cheek with care, Because another's rosy are? Be she fairer than the day, Or the flowery fields in May; If she think not well of me, What care I how fair she be? Should my heart be grieved or pine, 'Cause I see a woman kind? Or a well-disposed nature Joined with a lovely feature? Be she meeker, kinder than Turtle-dove or pelican; If she be not so to me, What care I how kind she be? Shall a woman's virtues move Me to perish for her love? Or her well-deservings known Make me quite forget my own? Be she with such goodness blest As may gain her name of Best: If she be not such to me, What care I how good she be? 'Cause her fortune seems too high, Shall I play the fool and die? Those that bear a noble mind, When they want of riches find, Think what with them they would do, Who without them dare to woo; And unless that mind I see, What care I though great she be? Great, or good, or kind, or fair, I will ne'er the more despair— If she love me, this believe, I will die ere she shall grieve; If she slight me when I woo, I can scorn and let her go; If she be not made for me, What care I for whom she be? Song by Ben Jonson. Take, oh take those lips away, That so sweetly were forsworn; And those eyes, the break of day, Lights that do mislead the morn: But my kisses bring again, Seals of love, but seal'd in vain. Hide, oh hide those hills of snow, Which thy rozen bosom bears; On whose tops the pinks that grow Are of those that April wears; But first set my poor heart free, Bound in these icy chains by thee. Song: The Glasses sparkle. The glasses sparkle on the board, The wine is ruby bright; The reign of pleasure is restored, Of ease and gay delight: The day is gone; the night's our own, Then let us feast the soul; Should any pain or care remain, Why drown it in the bowl. This world they say's a world of wo; But that I do deny; Can sorrow from the goblet flow? Or pain from beauty's eye? The wise are fools with all their rules, Who would our joys control— If life's a pain, I say't again, Why drown it in the bowl. That time flies fast the poet sings, Then surely 'twould be wise In rosy wine to dip his wings, And catch him as he flies. This night is ours: then strew with flow'rs The moments as they roll; If any pain or care remain, Why drown it in the bowl. The Widow to her Dying Child—by Matthew Child. That sigh's for thee, thou precious one; life's tide is ebbing fast, And o'er thy once all-joyous face death's sickly hue is cast. Thine azure eye hath lost its ray, thy voice its buoyant tone, And, like a flower the storm has crush'd, thy beauty's past and gone. Another pang, and all is o'er—the pulseless heart is still, Meekly, though sad, thy mother bows to the Almighty's will; Grief presses heavy on my heart, my tears fall thick and fast, But thou—thou art in heaven, my child, life's chequer'd dream is past. The busy feet that gladly ran thy mother's smile to greet; The prattling tongue that lisp'd her name in childhood's accents sweet; The glossy curl that beam'd like gold upon thy snowy brow; The lip, meet rival of the rose, O Death! where are they now? Wither'd beneath thine icy touch; lock'd in thy dull cold sleep; While all the joy a mother knows is silently to weep; Or start as Fancy's echo wakes thy voice to mock her pain, Then turn to gaze upon thy corse, and feel her grief is vain. The grave, the dark cold grave, full soon will hide thee from my view, While I my weary way through life in solitude pursue; My early and my only love is number'd with the dead, And thou—my last sole joy on earth—thou too, my boy, hast fled. Three Goblets of Wine. Three goblets of wine Alone should comprise The extent of the tipple Of those that are wise. The first is for health; And the second I measure, To be quaffed for the sake Of love, and of pleasure. The third is for sleep; And, while it is ending, The prudent will homeward Be thinking of wending. The fourth, not our own, Makes insolence glorious; And the fifth ends in shouting, And clamour uproarious And those who a sixth Down their weasands are pouring. Already are bruising, And fighting, and flooring. Oh! the tight little vessel, If often we fill it, How it trips up the heels Of those who may swill it! Indy Callaghan. I 'Twas on a windy night, About two o'clock in the morning, An Irish lad so tight, All wind and weather scorning, At Judy Callaghan's door, Sitting upon the palings, His love-tale he did pour, And this in part his wailings: Only say You'll be Mrs. Brallaghan; Don't say nay, Charming Judy Callaghan. II Oh! list to what I say, Charms you've got like Venus; Own your love you may, There's the wall between us. You lie fast asleep, Snug in bed a-snoring; Round the house I creep, Your hard heart imploring. Only say You'll have Mr. Brallaghan; Don't say nay, Charming Judy Callaghan. III I've got a pig and a sow, I've got a stye to sleep 'em, A calf and a brindled cow, And cabin, too, to keep 'em; Sunday hat and coat, An old gray mare to ride on; Saddle and bridle to boot, That you may ride astride on. Only say You'll be Mrs. Brallaghan; Don't say nay, Charming Judy Callaghan. IV I've got an acre of ground, I've got it set with praties; I've got of 'baccy a pound, I've got some tea for ladies: I've got the ring to wed, Whiskey to make us gaily; I've got a feather bed, And handsome new shilelagh. Only say You'll have Mr. Brallaghan; Don't say nay, Charming Judy Callaghan. V You've got a charming eye; You've got spelling and reading, You've got, and so have I, A taste for gentle breeding; You're rich, and fair, and young, As every body's knowing, You've got a dacent tongue Whene'er 'tis set a-going. Only say You'll have Mr. Brallaghan; Don't say nay, Charming Judy Callaghan. VI For a wife till death, I am willing to take ye But, och, I waste my breath, The devil sure can't wake ye. 'Tis just beginning to rain, So I'll get under cover; To-morrow I'll come again, And be your constant lover. Only say You'll be Mrs. Brallaghan; Don't say nay, Charming Judy Callaghan. Monsieur Indas. Here Judas, with a face where shame Or honor ne'er was known to be, Maintaining he is still the same, That he ne'er rattled—no—not he. But we must spurn the grovelling hack, To-day all white—to-morrow black, But hush! he'll hear, He'll hear, he'll hear; Iscariot's near—Iscariot's near! The moral Surface swears to-day Defiance to the priest and Pope; To-morrow, ready to betray His brother churchmen to the rope. But let us trust the hangman's string Is spun for him—the recreant thing! But hush! he'll hear, He'll hear, he'll hear; Iscariot's near—Iscariot's near! All character that knave has lost;— Soon will the Neophyte appear, By priestly hands bedipp'd, be-cross'd, Begreased, bechrism'd, with holy smear, Soon may he reach his final home, “A member of the Church of Rome.” But hush! he'll hear, He'll hear, he'll hear; Iscariot's near—Iscariot's near! Now from his mouth polluted flows— Snuffled in Joseph Surface tone— Laments o'er hapless Ireland's woes, O'er England's dangerous state a groan. Ere long beneath the hands of Ketch, Sigh for thyself, degraded wretch! But hush! he'll hear, He'll hear, he'll hear; Iscariot's near—Iscariot's near! Judas! till then the public fleece, For kin and cousins scheme and job, Rail against watchmen and police, Inferior swindlers scourge or rob. At last, another crowd before, Thou shalt speak once—and speak on more! But hush! he'll hear, He'll hear, he'll hear; Iscariot's near—Iscariot's near! Roger Goodfellow. A SONG. To be song to all sorry rascals. 1 Small sirs, so melancholy In patriotic wo,— To cure your carking folly Comes Roger Goodfellow; To live as best it list him, To scorn who does not so— Ha, ha, this is the system Of Roger Goodfellow. 2 At field the earliest whistling; At kirk the doucest seen; On holydays a-wrestling The stoutest on the green; Thus on in frank enjoyment And grateful glee to go— Ha, ha, 'tis the employment Of Roger Goodfellow. 3 Round Roger's cabin dangle, From curious carved pins, All wonders of the angle, All mysteries of gins; While in his cupboard niche, is A pewter pot or so— Ha, ha, these are the riches Of Roger Goodfellow. 4 To know the wind and weather Will make the salmon spring; To know the spot of heather That hides the strongest wing; To tell the moon's compliance With hail, rain, wind, and snow— Ha, ha, this is the science Of Roger Goodfellow. 5 For wine to think nought of it, With jolly good ale when lined; Nor ma'am my lady covet, So housewife Joan be kind; While of each old state-housewife he Doth nothing ask to know— Ha, ha, 'tis the philosophy Of Roger Goodfellow. 6 To say, “O mighty Maker, I bless thee, that thou here Hast made me thus partaker Of love and lusty cheer: As older still, oh, gayer, And jollier may I grow,”— Ha, 'tis a worthy prayer Of Roger Goodfellow. 7 Ho, ho, ye wheezing whiners; Ye kill-joys of the land! State-malady-diviners; Yarns-pinners out of sand! On common-sense who'd trample, And lay religion low; For God's sake take example By Roger Goodfellow. Backe and Side go Bare, go Bare. 1. Backe and side go bare, go bare, Both foot and hande go colde: But, bellye, God sende thee good ale yenough, Whether it be newe or olde. I cannot eat but lytle meate. My stomacke is not good; But sure I thinke that I can drynke With him that weares a hood. Though I go bare, take ye no care, I am nothing a colde; I stuff my skyn so full within, Of jolly good ale and olde. Backe and side go bare, go bare, Both foote and hande go colde; But, bellye, God sende thee good ale enoughe, Whether it be newe or olde. 2. I love no rost, but a nut-browne toste, And a crab laid in the fyre; A little breade shall do me stead, Much breade I not desyre. No frost nor snow, nor winde, nor trowe, Can hurt me if I wolde; I am so wrapt, and throwly lapt, Of jolly good ale and olde, Backe and side go bare, &amp;c. 3. And Tyb, my wyfe, that, as her lyfe, Loveth well good ale to seeke; Full of drynkes shee, tyll ye may see The teares run down her cheeke: Then dowth she trowle to mee the boule, Even as a mault-worme shuld; And sayth, “Sweete hart, I took my parte Of this jolly good ale and olde.” Backe and side go bare, &amp;c. 4. Now let them drynke, till they nod and wynke, Even as good felowes should doe: They shall not mysse to have the blysse Good ale doth bringe men to. And all poore soules that have scrowr'd boules, Or have them lustely trolde, God save the lyves of them and their wyves, Whether they be yonge or old. Backe and syde go bare, &amp;c. At my Time of Day. At my time o' day It were proper, in truth, If I could be less gay Than your frolicsome youth, And now, old and gray To plod on my way Like a senior, in sooth. I wish my old tricks I could wholly forget; But the apple here sticks, Undigested as yet. Let the good folks who will With my plan disagree, They may scold me their fill, If I only am free To retain in full glee All my good humor still. Farewell, Beggarly Scotland. 1 Farewell, farewell, beggarly Scotland. Cold and beggarly poor countrie; If ever I cross thy border again, The muckle deil must carry me. There's but one tree in a' the land, And that's the bonny gallows tree; The very nowte look to the south, And wish that they had wings to flee. 2 Farewell, farewell, beggarly Scotland, Brose and Bannocks, crowdy and kale! Welcome, welcome, jolly old England, Laughing lasses and foaming ale! 'Twas when I came to merry Carlisle, That out I laughed loud laughters three, And if I cross the Sark again, The muckle deil maun carry me. 3 Farewell, farewell, beggarly Scotland, Kilted kimmers, wi' carroty hair, Pipers, who beg that your honors would buy A bawbee's worth of their famished air. I'd rather keep Cadwallader's goats, And feast upon toasted cheese and leeks, Than go back again to the beggarly North, To herd 'mang loons with bottomless breeks. French Slang Song from Vidocq.

In Fancy-land there is a burst of wo, The spirit's tribute to the fallen; see On each scarr'd front the clouds of sorrow grow, Bloating its sprightly shine. But what is he For whom grief's mighty butt is broach'd so free? Were his brows shadow'd by the awful crown, The Bishop's mitre, or high plumery Of the mail'd warrior? Won he his renown On pulpit, throne, or field, whom death hath now struck down? He won it in the field where arms are none, Save those the mother gives to us. He was A climbing star which had not fully shone, Yet promised in its glory to surpass Our champion star ascendant; but alas! The sceptred shade that values earthly might, And pow'r and pith, and bottom, as the grass, Gave with his fleshless fist a buffet slight;— Say, bottle-holding Leach, why ends so soon the fight? What boots t' inquire?—'Tis done. Green mantled Erin May weep her hopes of milling sway past by, And Cribb, sublime, no lowlier rival fearing, Repose, sole Ammon of the fistic sky, Conceited, quaffing his blue ruin high, Till comes the Swell, that come to all men must, By whose foul blows Sir Daniel low doth lie, Summons the Champion to resign his trust, And mingles his with Kings, Slaves, Chieftains, Beggars' dust! SORROW IS DRY. Being a New Song, by Dr. James Scott. When to Peggy Bauldie's daughter, first I told Sir Daniel's death, Like a glass of soda-water it took away her breath; It took away your breath, my dear, and it sorely dimm'd your sight, And ay ye let the salt, salt tear, down fall for Erin's knight; For he was a knight of glory bright, the spur ne'er deck'd a bolder, Great George's blade itself was laid upon Sir Daniel's shoulder. Sing, Hey ho, the Sneddon, &amp;c. I took a turn along the street, to breathe the Trongate air, Carnegie's lass I chanced to meet, with a bag of lemons fair; Says I, “Gude Meg, ohon! ohon! you've heard of Dan's disaster— If I'm alive, I'll come at five, and feed upon your master— A glass or two no harm will do to either saint or sinner, And a bowl with friends will make amends for a so so sort of dinner.” Sing, Hey ho, the Sneddon, &amp;c. I found Carnegie in his nook, upon the old settee, And dark and dismal was his look, as black as black might be, Then suddenly the blood did fly, and leave his face so pale, That scarce I knew, in alter'd hue, the bard of Largo's vale; But Meg was winding up the jack, so off flew all my pains, For, large as cocks, two fat earocks I knew were hung in chains. Sing, Hey ho, the Sneddon, &amp;c. Nevertheless, he did express his joy to see me there— Meg laid the cloth, and, nothing loath, I soon pull'd in my chair; The mutton broth and bouilli both came up in season due— The grace is said—when Provan's head at the door appears in view— The bard at work like any Turk, first nods an invitation; For who so free as all the three from priggish botheration? Sing, Hey, ho, the Sneddon, &amp;c. Ere long the Towddies deck the board with a cod's head and shoulders, And the oyster-sauce it surely was great joy to all beholders. To George our king a jolly cann of royal port is poured— Our gracious king, who knighted Dan with his own shining sword— The next we sip with trembling lip—'tis of the claret clear— To the hero dead that cup we shed, and mix it with a tear. Sing, Hey ho, the Sneddon, &amp;c. 'Tis now your servant's turn to mix the nectar of the bowl: Still on the Ring our thoughts we fix, while round the goblets roll, Great Jackson, Belcher, Scroggins, Gas, we celebrate in turns, Each Christian, Jew, and Pagan, with the Fancy's flame that burns; Carnegie's finger on the board a mimic circle draws, And, Egan-like, h' expounds the rounds, and pugilistic laws. Sing, Hey ho the Sneddon, &amp;c. 'Tis thus that worth heroic is suitably lamented.— Great Daniel's shade, I know it, dry grief had much resented— What signify your tear and sigh?—A bumper is the thing Will gladden most the generous ghost of a champion of the King, The tear and sigh from voice and eye must quickly pass away, But the bumper good may be renewed until our dying day! Sing, Hey ho, the Sneddon, &amp;c. EXTRACT FROM MY GREAT AUTO-BIOGRAPHICAL POEM. It is most veritable,—that sage law Which tells that, at the wane of mightiness, Yea even of colossal guilt, or power That, like the iron man by poets feign'd, Can with uplifted arm draw from above The ministering lightnings, all insensible To touch of other feeling, we do find That which our hearts have cherish'd but as fear, Is mingled still with love; and we must weep The very loss of that which caused our tears.— E'en so it happeneth when Donnelly dies. Cheeks are besullied with unused brine, And eyes disguis'd in tumid wretchedness, That oft have put such seeming on for him, But not at Pity's bidding!—Yea, even I, Albeit, who never “ruffian'd” in the ring, Nor know of “challenge,” save the echoing hills; Nor “fibbing,” save that poesy doth feign; Nor heard his fame, but as the mutterings Of clouds contentious on Helvellyn's side, Distant, yet deep, agnize a strange regret, And mourn Donnelly—Honourable Sir Daniel:— (Blessings be on them, and eternal praise, The Knighter and the Knighted.) Love doth dwell Here in these solitudes, and our corporal clay Doth for its season bear the self-same fire, Impregnate with the same humanities, Moulded and mixed like others. I remember, Once on a time,—'twas when I was a boy, For I was childish once, and often since Have, with a cheerful resignation, learned How soon the boy doth prophecy the man,— I chanced, with one whom I could never love, Yet seldom left, to thread a thorny wood, To seek the stock-doves' sacred domicile;— Like thieves, we did contend about our crime, I and that young companion. Of that child His brief coevals still had stood in awe, And Fear did do him menial offices, While Silence walk'd beside, and word breath'd none. Howbeit, mine arm, which oft in vassal wise Had borne his satchel, and but ill defended From buffets, half in sport, half tyrannous, With which I was reguerdon'd,—chanced prevail. His soul was then subdued, and much and sore He wept, convulsive; nay, his firm breast heav'd, As doth the bosom of the troublous lake After the whirlwind goeth; and so sad Did seem the ruins of his very pride, I could not choose but weep with him, so long We sobb'd together, till a smile 'gan dry The human rain, and he once more was calm;— For sorrow, like all else, hath end. Albeit, Those tears, however boyish, were more fit, Since nature's self did draw them from their source, Than aught that cunning'st poet can distil, By potent alchemy, from human eye, To consecrate Donnelly's grave. Even so; For they discours'd with a dumb eloquence, Beyond the tongue of dirge or epitaph, Of that which passeth in man's heart, when Power, Like Babylon, hath fall'n, and pass'd away. SIR DANIEL DONNELLY.—A BALLAD. I came down to breakfast—And why all this sobbing, This weeping and wailing? I hastily cried; Has Grimalkin, my boy, ta'en away your tame Robin? Has Duckling, or Pullet, or White Coney died? 'Twas thus the short list of his joys I ran over, While the tears were fast coursing down Timothy's face, And strove the small darling his red cheek to cover.— What is this?—thought my soul—Is it grief or disgrace? I looked on the Courier, my weekly newspaper, For I felt that the cause of his sorrow was there; So quick is grief's eye that no word could escape her— “Dead is Daniel, the hero of Donnybrooke fair!” O mournful was then the low song of the kettle, And long look'd my face in the bright polish'd grate; Dull, dull clank'd the tongs, though composed of true metal, They seemed to my fancy the long shears of fate. I sought the fresh air, but the sun, like a firebrand In my dark bosom kindled grief's faggotty pile: Ah, me! ye five Catholic millions of Ireland, What now will become of your bull-breeding isle? Mine eyes met the earth, in their wand'ring uneasy; And I thought, as I saw through the vanishing snow The flower of Sir Daniel, the bright shining Daisy, On that beautiful poem I wrote long ago. By the stroke of the thunder-stone split in its glory, On the earth lay extended a green-crested pine; Then I dreamt, poor Sir Dan, of thy pitiful story, For the trunk was as straight and as knotty as thine! Thus sun, flower, and tree all, in blaze, blight, or blossom, The same sombre image of sorrow supplied, While Nature breath'd forth from her mountainous bosom, ‘Weep, weep for the day when Dan Donnelly died!” ODONNELLY, AN ODE BY MORGAN ODOHERTY. I. When green Erin laments for her hero, removed From the Isle where he flourished, the Isle that he loved, Where he entered so often the twenty foot lists, And, twinkling like meteors, he flourished his fists, And gave to his foes more set downs and toss overs, Than ever was done by the greatest philosophers, In folio, in twelves, or in quarto, Shall the harp of Odoherty silent remain, And shall he not waken its music again? Oh! yes, with his soul and his heart too! II. Majestic Odonnelly! proud as thou art, Like a cedar on top of Mount Hermon, We lament that death shamelessly made thee depart, In the gripes, like a blacksmith or chairman. Oh! hadst thou been felled by Tom Cribb in the ring, Or by Carter been milled to a jelly, Oh! sure that had been a more dignified thing, Than to kick for a pain in your belly! III. A curse on the belly that robbed us of thee, And the bowels unfit for their office; A curse on the potyeen you swallowed too free, For a stomach complaint, all the doctors agree, Far worse than a headach or cough is. Death, who like a cruel and insolent bully, drubs All those he thinks fit to attack, Cried Dan, my tight lad, try a touch of my mulligrubs, Which soon laid him flat on his back! IV. Great Spirits of Broughton, Jem Belcher, and Fig, Of Corcoran, Pierce, and Dutch Sam; Whether up stairs or down, you kick up a rig, And at intervals pause your blue ruin to swig, Or with grub, your bread baskets to cram. Or, whether for quiet you're placed all alone In some charming retired little heaven of your own, Where the turf is elastic, in short just the thing That Bill Gibbons would choose when he's forming a ring, That wherever you wander you still may turn to, And thrash and be thrashed till you're all black and blue; Where your favourite enjoyments for ever are near, And you eat and you drink, and you fight all the year; Ah! receive then to join in your milling delight, The shade of Sir Daniel Donnelly, knight; With whom a turn up is no frolic; His is no white or cold liver, For he beat Oliver, Challenged Carter, and died of the colic. V. Bad luck to my soul, But I'll fill the punch bowl, To the brim with good stingo; and so, Nelly, Don't let the toast pass you, But fill up your glass to Demolishing Daniel Donnelly. [Mourn Erin, sons of Erin mourn] Translated by the Rev. E. Hincks, F. T. C. D. 1 Mourn Erin, sons of Erin mourn, Give utterance to the inward throe, As wails of her first love forlorn, The virgin clad in robes of wo. 2 Mourn for our Champion snatched away From the fair Currag's verdant ring; Mourn for his fist now wrapt in clay, No more the ponderous thump to fling. 3 Mourn for the daisy flower that went, Ere half disclosed its boxing powers; Mourn the green bud so rudely rent From Ireland's pngilistic bowers. 4 Mourn for the universal wo, With solemn dirge and faltering tongue, For Ireland's champion is laid low, So stout, so hearty, and so strong. 9 Mourn for old Ireland's hopes decayed, Her bruisers weep in mournful strain, Their fair example prostrate laid, By seven-and-forty tumblers slain. 11 Long as the Commons-hall is trod, Will I the yearly dirge renew, Mourn for the nursling of the sod, Our darling hurried from our view. 12 The proud shall pass forgot; the chill, Damp, trickling vault their only mourner, Not so our daisy; no, that still Clings to the breast which first had worn her. A DIRGE OVER SIR DANIEL DONNELLY; BY THOMAS JENNINGS. Tune—“Molly Astore.” 1 As down Exchequer Street I strayed, A little time ago, I chanced to meet an honest blade, His face brimful of wo; I asked him why he seemed so sad, Or why he sighed so sore; O Grammachree, och Tom, says he, Sir Daniel is no more! 2 With that he took me straight away, And pensively we went, To where poor Daniel's body lay, In wooden waistcoat pent; And many a yard before we reached The threshold of his door, We heard the keeners as they screeched, Sir Daniel is no more! 3 We entered soft, for feelings sad Were stirring in our breast, To take our farewell of the lad, Who now was gone to rest; We took a drop of Dan's potheen, And joined the piteous roar; O, where shall be his fellow seen, Since Daniel is no more! 4 His was the fist whose weighty dint Did Oliver defeat, His was the fist that gave the hint It need not oft repeat, His was the fist that overthrew His rivals o'er and o'er; But now we cry in pillalu, Sir Daniel is no more! 5 Cribb, Cooper, Carter, need not fear Great Donnelly's renown, For at his wake we're seated here, While he is lying down; For Death, that primest swell of all, Has laid him on the floor, And left us here, alas! to bawl, Sir Daniel is no more! EPITAPH. Here lies Sir Daniel Donnelly, A pugilist of fame; In Ireland bred and born was he, And he was genuine game; Then if an Irishman you be, When you have read this o'er, Go home and drink the memory Of him who is no more. [Underneath this pillar high] Underneath this pillar high Lies Sir Daniel Donnelly; He was a stout and handy man, And people called him “Buffing Dan;” Knighthood he took from George's sword, And well he wore it, by my word! He died at last from forty-seven Tumblers of punch he drank one even; O'erthrown by punch, unharmed by fist, He died unbeaten Pugilist! Such a buffer as Donnelly, Ireland never again will see. Obiit xiii? Kal. Martii mdcccxx. [“What is it ails you, ye beauteous people] A New Song, to the tune of the Groves of Blarney, being in Lamentation for the unhappy death of Sir Daniel Donnelly, Kt. C. I. By Richard Dowden. 1 “What is it ails you, ye beauteous people Why are ye dropping the salt, salt tear, Why does your tipple stand like a steeple, None of ye stirring about the beer?” 'Twas thus I spoke to some honest fellows, Sitting in grief in Cork's own town, At Judy Kelly's, sign of the bellows, Over the best of Beamish's brown. Hulla, hulla, hulla, hulla, hulla, mulla-gone. 2 'Twas they that answered me in a minute, “Where do you come from, my honest man? If from Ireland, the devil's in it If you don't know 'tis all for Dan! For brave Sir Daniel, that was no spaniel, But a true bull-dog of Irish game, Who laid his whacks on the bullying Saxon All for the honour of Ireland's name. Hulla, hulla, &amp;c. 3 “He treated Oliver, just as Gulliver Treated the Lilliputian's house; For he was a buffer that would not suffer Crossbuttock, cuff, or thump like a mouse; But like a lion, or bright Orion, Or ould King Brian, surnamed Boro', Who made the Danes, Sir, quit Clontarf's plains, Sir, As fast as Boney quit Waterloo. Hulla, hulla, &amp;c. 4 “Our worthy Regent was so delighted With the great valour he did evince, That Dan was cited, ay, and invited To come be knighted by his own Prince; Sir Richard Phillips, or Sir Bob Wilson, Could not compare with him in worth: For this transaction, may satisfaction Crown every action of George the Fourth. Hulla, hulla, &amp;c. 5 “Was I a poet, 'tis I would show it, And all should know it this cruel night; I'd give the nation a bold oration In declamation and letters bright From Cork and Kerry to Londonderry A mullagone I'd sadly roar, With sweet Poll Cleary, and Judy Leary, The blood-relations of my Lord Donoughmore. Hulla, hulla, &amp;c. 6 “O Counsellor Connell, Æneas M'Donnel, And Charley Phillips, my speaking man, How you would swagger in trope and figure, If you were paid for praising Dan! But without money, none of 'em, honey, Can bear to wag their humbugging jaw; They're not worth naming, the set of scheming, Roguish, make-gaming limbs of the law.” Hulla, hulla, &amp;c. 7 So sung this sporter, over his porter, Chanting as sweet as a nightingale; Even Nebuchadnezzar, or Julius Cæsar, Would gladly stay Sir, to hear the tale. I bet a penny, that Mr. Rennie, And Mr. Davy, himself beside, Wouldn't make a ditty one half so pretty, On brave Sir Daniel, our Irish pride, Hulla, hulla, &amp;c. The Embalmer. I. VERSE OF “TAKE THY OLD CLOAK ABOUT THEE.” Sung by Iago in the Second Act of Othello. King Stephen was a worthy peer, His breeches cost him but a crown, He held them sixpence all too dear, And so he call'd the tailor loon. He was a king, and wore a crown, Thou art a squire of low degree; 'Tis pride that pulls the country down, So take thy old cloak about thee. II. VERSES OF JULY THE FIRST, THE GREAT ORANGE SONG IN IRELAND. July the first, in old Bridge town, There was a grievous battle,— Where many a man lay on the ground, And the cannon they did rattle. King James, he pitch'd his tents between, His lines for to retire, But William threw his bomb-balls in, And set them all on fire. The horse and cannon cross'd the stream, And the foot came following a'ter, But brave Duke Schomberg lost his life In crossing the Boyne Water. A bullet from the Irish came, And grazed King William's arm— They thought his majesty was slain, But it did him little harm. The Protestants of Drogheda Have reason to be thankful, That they were all preserved that day, Though they were but a handful. III. GROVES OF BLARNEY. The groves of Blarney they are most charming— Blarnæi nemora sunt jucundissima visu. 'Tis lady Jeffries, that owns this station, Like Alexander or Helen fair; There is no lady in all the nation For emulation can with her compare. She has castles round her, that no nine-pounder Can dare to plunder her place of strength, But Oliver Cromwell he did her pummel, And made a hole in her battlement. IV. VERSE OF MARY AMBREE. When our brave commanders, whom death could not daunt, March'd off to the siege of the city of Gaunt; They counted their forces by two and by three, But the foremost in battle was Mary Ambree. V. VERSE OF SIR TRISTREM. [I have translated the entire poem.] Geten and born was so, The child was fair and white, Nas never Rohand so wo, He wist not what to wite; To childbed ded he go, His owhen wiif al so tite, Said he had children to, On hem was his delite, Bi Crist, In court men cleped him so, Tho Tram bifor the Trist. VI. ON SIR P. SARSFIELD. Oh! Patrick Sarsfield, Ireland's wonder, Who fought in field like any thunder, One of King James's chief commanders, Now lies the food of crows in Flanders. Ohone! VII. ON JOHN, DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH. By Doctor Evans. Here lies John, Duke of Marlborough, Who ran the Frenchman thorough and thorough; Married Sarah Jennings, spinster, Died in Saint James's, and was buried in Westminster. VIII. CONCLUSION OF THE EPITAPH ON HENRY, DUKE OF GRAFTON, SON OF CHARLES II. KILLED AT THE SIEGE OF CORK, 1690. Yet a bullet of Cork It did his work, Unhappy pellet! With grief I tell it, It has undone Great Cæsar's son! A statesman's spoil'd; A soldier foil'd; God rot him Who shot him,— A son of a—, I say no more. Here lies Henry, the Duke of Grafton! IX. ON ROBIN HOOD. Underneath this little stone, Lies Robert, Earl of Huntingdon; He was in truth an archer good, And people call'd him Robin Hood. Such outlaws as he and his men England never will see again. X. ON SIR DANIEL DONNELLY, C. I. Underneath this pillar high, Lies Sir Daniel Donnelly; He was a stout and handy man, And people call'd him buffing Dan. Knighthood he took from George's sword, And well he wore it by my word! He died at last, from forty-seven Tumblers of punch he drank one even. O'erthrown by punch, unharm'd by fist, He died unbeaten pugilist. Such a buffer as Donnelly, Ireland never again will see. Irish Melodies. Song I. SAINT PATRICK. 1 A fig for St. Dennis of France, He's a trumpery fellow to brag on; A fig for St. George and his lance, Which spitted a heathenish dragon; And the Saints of the Welshman or Scot Are a couple of pitiful pipers, Both of whom may just travel to pot, Compared with the patron of swipers, St. Patrick of Ireland, my dear! 2 He came to the Emerald Isle On a lump of a paving-stone mounted; The steam-boat he beat to a mile, Which mighty good sailing was counted: Says he, “The salt water, I think, Has made me most bloodily thirsty, So bring me a flagon of drink, To keep down the mulligrubs, burst ye, Of drink that is fit for a saint.” 3 He preach'd then with wonderful force, The ignorant natives a-teaching; With a pint he wash'd down his discourse, “For,” says he, “I detest your dry preaching.” The people, with wonderment struck, At a pastor so pious and civil, Exclaim'd “We're for you, my old buck, And we pitch our blind gods to the devil, Who dwells in hot water below.” 4 This ended, our worshipful spoon Went to visit an elegant fellow, Whose practice each cool afternoon Was to get most delightfully mellow. That day, with a black jack of beer, It chanced he was treating a party; Says the saint, “This good day, do you hear, I drank nothing to speak of, my hearty, So give me a pull at the pot.” 5 The pewter he lifted in sport, (Believe me, I tell you no fable,) A gallon he drank from the quart, And then planted it full on the table. “A miracle!” every one said, And they all took a haul at the stingo; They were capital hands at the trade, And drank till they fell; yet, by jingo! The pot still frothed over the brim. 6 Next day quoth his host, “'Tis a fast, But I've nought in my larder but mutton, And on Fridays who'd make such repast, Except an unchristian-like glutton?” Says Pat, “Cease your nonsense, I beg, What you tell me is nothing but gammon; Take my compliments down to the leg, And bid it come hither a salmon!” And the leg most politely complied. 7 You've heard, I suppose, long ago, How the snakes in a manner most antic, He march'd to the county Mayo, And trundled them into th' Atlantic. Hence not to use water for drink The people of Ireland determine; With mighty good reason, I think, Since St. Patrick has fill'd it with vermin, And vipers, and other such stuff. 8 O! he was an elegant blade, As you'd meet from Fair Head to Kilcrumper, And though under the sod he is laid, Yet here goes his health in a bumper! I wish he was here, that my glass He might by art magic replenish; But as he is not, why, alas! My ditty must come to a finish— Because all the liquor is out! Song II. LAMENT OF A CONNAUGHT RANGER. Air.—Lamentation over Sir Dan. 1 I wish to St. Patrick we had a new war, I'd not care who 'twas with, nor what it was for: With the French, or the Yankees—or, better again, With the yellow Mulattoes of Lisbon or Spain! 2 My heart is half broke when I think of the fun We had before Boney, poor fellow, was done; Oh! 'twas I who was sore when I heard he was dead, For I thought on the days when he got me good bread. 3 When he, who, God rest him! was never afraid, Sir Thomas, commanded the Fighting Brigade; And the Rangers of Connaught—to see them was life— Made game of the Frenchmen, and gave them the knife. 4 When abroad and at home we had sport and content— Who cared then a damn for tithe, taxes, or rent? When each dashing fine fellow who wish'd to enlist, Might be off to the wars with his gun in his fist. 5 Now the landlord is bother'd, and tenant bereft— The soldier's discharged,—and the sailor adrift,— Half-pays to our captains poor living afford, And the Duke is no more than a Government Lord! 6 And our active light-bobs, and our bold grenadiers, Must dirty their fingers with plough, loom, or shears; Or if, just out of fun, we would venture a snap At no more than a proctor, we're thrown into trap. 7 So bad luck to the minute that brought us the peace, For it almost has ground the nose out of our face; And I wish to St. Patrick we had a new war, Och! no matter with whom, no, nor what it is for! Song III. RAFFERTY'S ADVICE. Air.—Limerick Glove. 1 When you go courting a neat or a dainty lass, Don't you be sighing or ready to faint, alas! Little she'd care for such pluckless philandering, And to Old Nick she would send you a wandering. But, you thief, you rogue, you rapparee! Arrah, have at her like Paddy O'Rafferty. 2 Tip her the wink, and take hold of the fist of her; Kiss her before she'd have time to say Christopher; She may cry out, “You're an impudent fellow, sir!” But her eye will unsay what her tongue it may tell you, sir. Oh, you thief, you rogue, you rapparee, You're a devil of a fellow, Paddy O'Rafferty. 3 Give her another, or rather a score of 'em, Still you will find her ready for more of 'em; Press her, caress her, my dear, like a stylish man, For that is the way to go court like an Irishman. Oh, you, &amp;c. 4 Pitch to the devil sighings and “well-a-days,” Oglings and singing of piperly melodies; When in your arms you fairly have got her, sir, Her heart it will melt like a lump of fresh butter, sir! Oh, you, &amp;c. 5 Oh, the dear creatures—sure I am kill'd with 'em! My heart, was it big as the sea, would be fill'd with 'em; Far have I truff'd it, and surely where'er I went, 'Twas with the girls I had fun and merriment. Oh, you thief, you rogue, you rapparee, You're a devil of a fellow, Paddy O'Rafferty. Song IV. THE GATHERING OF THE MAHONYS. Tune—Groves of the Pool. 1 Jerry Mahony, arrah, my jewel, come, let us be off to the fair, For the Donovans all in their glory most certainly mean to be there; Says they, “The whole Mahony faction we'll banish 'em out clear and clean.” But it never was yet in their breeches, their bullaboo words to maintain. 2 There's Darby to head us, and Barney, as civil a man as yet spoke, 'Twould make your mouth water to see him, just giving a bit of a stroke; There's Corney, the bandy-legg'd tailor, a boy of the true sort of stuff, Who'd fight though the black blood was flowing like buttermilk out of his buff. 3 There's broken-nos'd Bat from the mountain—last week he burst out of the jail, And Murty the beautiful Tory, who'd scorn in a row to turn tail; Bloody Bill will be there like a darling, and Jerry, och! let him alone, For giving his blackthorn a flourish, or lifting a lump of a stone. 4 And Tim, who serv'd in the militia, his bayonet has stuck on a pole; Foxy Dick has his scythe in good order, a neat sort of tool on the whole; A cudgel, I see, is your weapon, and never I knew it to fail; But I think that a man is more handy, who fights, as I do, with a flail. 5 We muster a hundred shillelahs, all handled by elegant men, Who batter'd the Donovans often, and now will go do it again; To-day we will teach them some manners, and show that, in spite of their talk, We still, like our fathers before us, are surely the cocks of the walk. 6 After cutting out work for the sexton, by smashing a dozen or so, We'll quit in the utmost of splendour, and down to Peg Slattery's go; In gallons we'll wash down the battle, and drink to the next merry day; When must'ring again in a body, we all shall go leathering away. Song V. A REAL IRISH “FLY NOT YET.” [Tune—Lillibullero. Time, four o'clock in the morning, or thereabouts.] 1 Hark! hark! from below, The rascally row Of watchmen, in chorus, bawling “Four!” But spite of their noise, My rollocking boys! We'll stay till we've emptied one bottle more. Chorus. Bumpers—bumpers—flowing bumpers! Bumper your glasses high up to the brim! And he who is talking A word about walking, Out of the window at once with him! 2 Our whiskey is good, As ever yet stood, Steaming on table from glass or pot: It came from a still, Snug under a hill, Where the eye of the gauger saw it not. Bumpers, &amp;c. 3 Then why should we run Away from the sun— Here's to his health, my own elegant men! We drank to his rest Last night in the west, And we'll welcome him now that he wakes again. Bumpers, &amp;c. 4 And here we shall stop, Until every drop, That charges our bottles, is gone, clean gone; And then, sallying out, We'll leather the rout, Who've dared to remind us how time has run. Bumpers, &amp;c. Song VI. THE IMPASSIONED WAVE. [Tune—“Thomon um Though.”] 1 'Tis sweet upon the impassion'd wave To hear the voice of music stealing, And while the dark winds wildly rave, To catch the genuine soul of feeling! While all around, the ether blue Its dim, majestic beam is shedding, And roseate tints of heavenly hue Are through the midnight darkness spreading! 2 So is it when the thrill of love Through every burning pulse is flowing; And like the foliage of the grove, A holy light on all bestowing! O! never from this fever'd heart Shall dreams on wings of gold be flying; But e'en when life itself shall part, I'll think on thee, sweet maid, though dying! 3 'Twas thus, upon the mountain's height, Young Dermod sung his plaint of sorrow, Regardless of the evening light, That ushers in the gay to-morrow! For love had of his cheek bereft That smile—that glow—of joyous gladness, And sympathy's cold sting had left Nought there—but pale and gloomy sadness! Byron to Murray. Attacks on me were what I look'd for, Murray, But why the devil do they badger you? These godly newspapers seem hot as curry, But don't, dear Publisher, be in a stew. They'll be so glad to see you in a flurry— I mean those canting Quacks of your Review— They fain would have you all to their own Set; But never mind them—we're not parted yet. They surely don't suspect you, Mr. John, Of being more than accoucheur to Cain; What mortal ever said you wrote the Don? I dig the mine—you only fire the train! But here—why, really, no great lengths I've gone— Big wigs and buzz were always my disdain— But my poor shoulders why throw all the guilt on? There's as much blasphemy, or more, in Milton. The thing's a drama, not a sermon-book; Here stands the murderer—that's the old one there In gown and cassock how would Satan look? Should Fratricides discourse like Doctor Blair? The puritanic Milton freedom took, Which now-a-days would make a bishop stare; But not to shock the feelings of the age, I only bring you angels on the stage. To bully You—yet shrink from battling Me, Is baseness. Nothing baser stains “The Times,” While Jeffrey in each catalogue I see, While no one talks of priestly Playfair's crimes, While Drummond, at Marseilles, blasphemes with glee, Why all this row about my harmless rhymes? Depend on't, Piso, 'tis some private pique 'Mong those that cram your Quarterly with Greek. If this goes on, I wish you'd plainly tell 'em, 'Twere quite a treat to me to be indicted; Is it less sin to write such books than sell 'em? There's muscle!—I'm resolved I'll see you righted. In me, great Sharpe, in me converte telum! Come, Doctor Sewell, show you have been knighted. —On my account you never shall be dunn'd, The copyright, in part, I will refund. You may tell all who come into your shop, You and your Bull-dog both remonstrated; My Jackall did the same, you hints may drop, (All which, perhaps, you have already said.) Just speak the word, I'll fly to be your prop, They shall not touch a hair, man, in your head. You're free to print this letter; you're a fool If you don't send it first to the John Bull. Ode to Mrs. Flanagan. By an Irish Gentleman, lately deceased. MSS. No. I. To Mrs. Kitty Flanagan, comforts her on the absence of her husband, Jerry Flanagan, mate of the Jolly Jupiter, and drops a hint about a light dragoon. Why do cry, my sweet Mrs. Flanagan, When you will soon have your own dear man again, Whom the first wind will bring home from the Delaware, Brimful of sovereigns, and such other yellow ware? He's driven in to some port to the west of us, (A thing that might happen, dear, to the best of us,) Where he is sighing, sobbing, and chattering, Night and day long, of his own dear Catherine: Although his landlady, one Mrs. Gallagher, Wants him to quit you, the rogue, and to follow her. She tells him the tale of the wife of old Potiphar, (Relating a fact that will ne'er be forgot of her,) Who, from a feeling malignant and sulte-ry, Had Joseph near hanged for eschewing adultery: And from this basest, this vilest of women, he Gets Mr. Hunt's smutty story of Rimini, By which, 'tis plain, she hopes to a surety, Soon to corrupt his natural purity; But he resists her arts and her flattery, Deaf and determined, just as a battery. But there's a sergeant, one Patrick Hennessy, Keep away, Kitty, from all such men as he, Though he's so smart, that he's always employed, as Rough-rider to the old Marquis of Drogheda's, Though there are few so brawny and big, my dear, Or far better at dancing a jig, my dear, Close down your windows when he comes capering, Shut both your doors and your ears to his vapouring, Mind not the songs or sighs of this Hannibal, But, looking at him, cross as a Cannibal, Cry, “Come be off as light as a tailor, man, I will be true to my own dear sailorman.” Ode to Marshal Grouchy on his Return. MSS. No. II. To Marshal Grouchy on his Return; or, Congratulatory Address by Mons.—. 1 O welcome home, my marshal, my colleague true and good, When under brave Napoleon we dabbled long in blood; Who brought you back to Paris in Bourbon's royal days? Was it Madame Bonaparte's man, our own Monsieur de Cazes? 2 With thee I robbed through Prussia, through Portugal, and Spain; With thee I marched to Russia, and then—marched back again; With thee I faced the red-coats awhile at Waterloo; And with thee I raised the war-song of jolly sauve qui peut. 3 I took the oaths to Louis, and now with face of brass, I bawl against the royalists all in the Chambre Basse; But you my lad were exiled, a mighty cruel thing, For you did nothing surely, but fight against your king. 4 Then drink a health to th' Emperor, and curse Sir Hudson Lowe; And decorate with stolen plate your honest-earned chateau; And merrily, my marshal, we shall the goblet drain, 'Tis a chalice that I robbed one day, out of a church in Spain. 5 Fill, fill the bumper fairly, 'tis Chambertin, you see, The Emperor's favourite liquor, and chant in pious glee, A song of Monsieur Parny's Miladi Morgan's bard, And curse the tasteless Bourbons who won't his muse reward. 6 Then with our wigs all perfumed, and our beavers cocked so fierce, we'll throw a main together, or troll the amorous verse; And I'll get as drunk as Irishmen, as Irishmen morbleu, After six-and-thirty tumblers in drinking healths to you. Odes by Q. Horatius Flaccus, and the City Poet of 1788. TO DICKY GOSSIP. While he thinks of tittle-tattle, not to forget his wiggery. Do you see that stately caxon, Which looks with all its whiteness, Like a bush o'erlaid with snow; And the curls which range below, Stand stiff in frosty brightness. Come, melt some sweet pomatum— And, for powder do not stint us; Draw your irons from the stove; And, Dicky, quickly move, To make my old wig as portentous. Don't ask of to-morrow's matters, Since them, nor you, nor I, know; Mind your shop, my boy, nor spurn From customers, to earn, For scraping their muzzles, their rhino. Show yourself a wise wig-maker, For sure you've enough to handle, As long as folks don't wear Their own untrimmed gray hair, Without heeding the whispers of scandal Yet ah, those ears so itching! My muse can not restrain 'em; Should a laugh come from the street, Comb and razor you would quit, Nor longer could your fingers retain 'em. Drink Away! 1 Come draw me six magnums of claret, Don't spare it, But share it in bumpers around; And take care that in each shining brimmer No glimmer Of skimmering daylight be found. Fill away! Fill away! Fill away! Fill bumpers to those that you love, For we will be happy to day! As the gods are when drinking above, Drink away! Drink away! 2 Give way to each thought of your fancies, That dances, Or glances, or looks of the fair; And beware that from fears of to-morrow You borrow No sorrow, nor foretaste of care. Drink away, drink away, drink away! For the honour of those you adore: Come, charge! and drink fairly to-day, Though you swear you will never drink more. 3 I last night, cut, and quite melancholy, Cried folly! What's Polly to reel for her fame? Yet I'll banish such hint till the morning, And scorning Such warning to-night, do the same. Drink away, drink away, drink away! 'Twill banish blue devils and pain; And to-night for my joys if I pay, Why, to-morrow I'll do it again. Drouthiness. I had a dream, which was not all-my-eye. The deep wells were exhausted, and the pumps Delivered nothing but a windy groan To those who plied their handles; and the clouds Hung like exsuccous sponges in the sky. Morn came and went—and came and brought no rain, And men forgot their hunger in the dread Of utter failure of all drink—their chops Were all athirst for something potable; And they did swig, from hogsheads, brandy, wine, Cider, brown-stout, and such like, meant to serve For future merry-makings—cellars dim, Were soon dismantled of the regular tiers, Of bottles, which were piled within their binns; Small beer was now held precious—yea, they gulp'd Black treacle, daubing childish visages, Gripe-giving vinegar, and sallad oil. Nor were old phials, fill'd with doctor's stuff, Things to be sneezed at now—they toss'd them off. Happy were they who dwelt within the reach Of the pot-houses, and their foaming taps. Barrels were all a-broach—and hour by hour The spigots ran—and then a hollow sound Told that the casks were out—and the Red Cow, The Cat and Bagpipes, or the Dragon Green, Could serve no customers—their pots were void The moods of men, in this unwatery, Small-beerless time, were different. Some sat Unbuttoning their waistcoats, while they frown'd, Scarce knowing what they did; while hopeful, some Button'd their breeches-pockets up, and smiled; And servant lasses scurried to and fro, With mops unwet, and buckets, wondering when The puddles would be fill'd, that they might scrub The household floors; but finding puddles none, They deem'd their pattens would grow obsolete— Things of forgotten ages. So they took Their disappointed mops, and render'd them Back to their dry receptacles, The birds Forsook their papery leaves. The dairy cows Went dry, and were not milk'd. Incessantly Ducks quack'd, aye stumbling on with flabby feet, Over the sun-baked mud, which should have felt Pulpy beneath their bills; and eels did crawl Out from what had been ponds, and needed not The angler's baited hook, or wicker-pot, To catch them now,—for they who baffled erst, Through sliminess, man's grasp, were still indeed Wriggling—but dusty,—they were skinn'd for food. He who, by lucky chance, had wherewithal To wet his whistle, took his drop apart, And smack'd his lips alone; small love was left: Folks had but then one thought, and that was drink, Where to be had, and what? The want of it Made most men cross, and eke most women too. The patient lost their patience, and the sour Grew still more crabbed, sharp-nosed, and shrill-voiced. Even cats did scratch their maiden Mistresses, Angry that milk forthcame not,—all, save one, And he was faithful to the virgin dame Who petted him;—but, be it not conceal'd, The rumour ran that he his whiskers greased From a pomatum-pot, and so he quell'd The rage of thirst; himself sought naught to lap, But, with a piteous and perpetual mew, And a quick snivelling sneeze, sat bundled up, And taking matters quietly—he lived. The crowd forsook our village; only two Of the parishioners still tarried there, And they were enemies; they met beside (One only stood before and one behind) The empty settle of a public-house, Where had been heap'd a mass of pots and mugs For unavailing usage; they snatch'd up, And, scraping, lick'd, with their pounced-parchment tongues, The porter-pots a-dust; their eager eyes Dived into gin-bottles, where gin was not, Labell'd in mockery,—then they lifted up Their eyes for one brief moment, but it was To hang their heads more sillily, ashamed Each of his futile quest;—but 'twas enough For recognition,—each saw, and leer'd and grinn'd.— Even at their mutual sheepishness they grinn'd, Discovering how upon each foolish face Shiness had written Quiz. The land was dry; Day pass'd, defrauded of its moistest meals, Breakfastless, milkless, tealess, soupless, punchless, All things were dry,—a chaos grimed with dust. Tubs washer-womanless, replete with chinks, Stood in their warping tressels—suds were none; And dirty linen lost all heart, and hope Of due ablution—shirts were worn a month— White pocket-handkerchiefs were quite abandon'd, And so were nankin inexpressibles— Yea, most things washable,—and Washing seem'd To threaten that henceforth it must be named Among lost arts. Water had fled the Earth, And left no tears in people's eyes to weep Its sad departure;—Drouthiness did reign Queen over all—She was the universe! A FESTAL ODE. What constitutes a feast? Not haunch of venison, of flavour true, Fat, juicy, nicely drest; Nor turtle calipash of verdant hue; Not soup, in whose rich flood, French cooks a thousand relishes infuse; Not fricassees well stewed, Nor France's greater boast, high-fumed ragouts; Not a sirloin of beef, Crowning a dish in which rich gravy lies; Not turbot, ocean chief, Which ruddy lobster-sauce accompanies, No—a good appetite, And good digestion, turn into a feast Whate'er front-tooth can bite, And grinders manducate, and palate taste. Be it homely bread and cheese, Of which the ravenous carl tucks in some pounds; Or bacon smoked, where grease, Five fingers thick, each stripe of lean surrounds; Be it onion, fiery root, Whose rank effluvia draws unbidden tears; Potato, Erin's fruit, With which the bogtrotter his stomach cheers; Be it cabbage, flabby leaf! Which cross-legg'd tailors smack with liquorish chops; Or oatmeal porridge, chief,— Undoubted chief of Scotland's rustic slops. Yet in these meals so plain, Let but sharp appetite as guest attend, And napkin'd Aldermen May grudge the goût with which the bits descend. This constitutes a feast, To experience hunger and have wherewithal (Though it be not of the best) To stop the void bread-basket's healthy call. Lord Byron's Combolio. INTRODUCTION. Reading public! whose hunger, Thou egregious bookmonger, Gets monthly large parcels Of fresh sheets, for thy morsels; And though publishers race, yet Thou never art satiate Of new poems, new histories, New dramas, new Mysteries, New romances, new novels, New voyages, new travels, New tourifications, New post prandium orations; New lives and new memoirs, New guide-books, new grammars, New systems of science, (Some writ in defiance Of the sense that's called common) New endeavors to hum one, Of old lies new editions, Of old follies new visions, New modes of abusing, (Peep for these the Reviews in), New revivals of scandal, By some right or wrong handle; In short, what is new, Sir, Finds in thee a peruser. Reader General! thou patron Of many a squadron, Who, with goose quills ink laden, (Which their stands had best staid in,) Lose available labour In blurring white paper,— To thee do I dedi- cate, now this most edi- fying sample of doggrel, Which will sure catalogue well The works now abundant, Of an Author redundant: And we do not disparage The rolls of the Peerage In saying, though they strive all To discover a rival; And be Horace Walpole Stirr'd up with a tall pole, And his book's last edition Put in due requisition; Let the Lords not be hindered From including their kindred,— Yet they will not environ Such a Poet as Byron. Him, thou, Reading Demus! Hast been pleased to make famous; So take to thy favour This industrious endeavour To make out a list of The hanks, which his distaff Has long time been untwining, Of verses so genuine, That renown they must e'en win. Let some fame too o'erbubble On his pate, who great trouble (Behold it) hath taken In this catalogue making. THE ROSARY. The first stretch of his powers Was made in “The Hours” 'Clept “of Idlesse,” that syren, “By George Gordon Lord Byron.” No need of diviner, To shew that “a Minor” The book had compounded; But to warn us, we found it Printed under and over, On the back on the cover, On the title-page ominous, And in prose prologomenous. 'Twas, in spite of the pother Neither one thing nor t'other; And though it was poorish, It deserved not the flourish Of that tomahawk cruel In the saffron and cerule, Which notch'd it and nick'd it; In short those wits wicked Had their sport with the lordling, Whom they thought a soft bardling, Too meek to retort it; But they were not so sorted, For his next was a stinger; Master Frank found his finger Had been burnt in the venture With one, not a flincher When his Pegasus skittish Gave a fling at “Bards British.” If the “Hours” failed in merit, There was talent and spirit In this nettle stuff'd satire; And the blows, like the platter Of hail, fell by dozens On our splenetic cousins Dun-Edin's Reviewers, Those paddlers in sewers, Where their mud-ammunition (Hooting, hissing, derision,) Is mix'd up for griming All those who won't chime in With jacobin shoutings, And infidel doubtings. Then came doughty Childe Harold, With whom the world quarrell'd, Because this aspirant, Though observant, enquirant, Shrewd, keen, energetic, Sublime, and pathetic— Contriving to wedge in all, In one word, original; Yet betray'd the foot cloven, Scepticism being inwoven In his talk upon matters Best left to his betters. How plain folks roll'd their gogglers! How the learned prov'd bogglers! At the name of the “Giaour.” For sure ne'er to that hour Did four-fifths of the vowels Congregate in the bowels Of a syllable single; Even yet how to mingle Their sounds in one's muzzle, Continues a puzzle. But the fragments are clever,— Surpassed has he never, In his loftiest of stretches. Two or three of the sketches. “The Bride of Abydos” Next sprang up beside us; From the first time I met her, The Giaour pleased me better; Although I must own it, With reluctance upon it, Since my preference showing, O'er a lady so glowing, Of a wretch with a white face, Argues not much politeness. With a head rough as horse hair, Heaves in sight now “The Corsair. His Lordship here followed The metre that's hallowed By the poets, whose due, d'ye see, Is no longer sub judice. Ne'er could fail this fine story To find fit auditory; It holds one quite breathless With interest; yet, nathless, 'Twould accord with my wishes, If stops, 'stead of dashes, Were put to the poem, (How to do it I'd shew 'em;) For, I'm sure, I was wearied, Seeing comma and period Smash'd,—as if punctuation Were gone out of fashion. “An Ode,” rather warty, Came to Nap Buonaparte; Wherein he was scolded For not having folded His cloak like a Roman; And, indebted to no man, Kick'd the bucket with glory, And lived ever in story. Then appear'd Senor “Lara,” Which, at sight, one could swear a Reappearance of Conrad. The attempt though did honour add To our author, clear sighted; And ne'er hath he indited With more perspicacity, And psychologic sagacity. To each “Hebrew Melody,” Alas! and Ah, well-a-day! For most are but rudish, And a scantling are goodish; So let Messrs. Braham And Nathan enjoy 'em. “The Siege,” next, “of Corinth,” Illustrates a war in th' Morea;—but I dare say, From perusal or hearsay, Most now think on the munching Of the dogs, and their “crunching,” (On what, in his jargon, Dr. Gall calls an organ,) Stripping off the scalp, rot 'em! “As ye peel figs in autumn.” With Alp to the arena Came the fair “Parisina.” That he should not have written, On this subject forbidden, Still sticks in my gizzard, 'Spite of “gruff General Izzard.” Who devoid of all mercy is Tow'rds King Leigh and his verses; And because without panic, That monarch Cockannic, Rhymed lightly on incest, Z., with fury intensest, Pour'd out a full bottle Of wrath on his noddle; But of Byron he's chary, And lauds this same “Pari- sine,” as if it were shapen, All the perils escaping. All we say of a “Monody” Is, it issued forth on a day. After this, the “Third Canto Of Childe Harold” was sent to Find its fate with the nation; And it gained approbation. “The Prisoner of Chillon” Was sufficient to mill one; So doleful,—so grievous,— With nought to relieve us! Enter “Manfred;” a serious Sort of white witch mysterious; Of our genuine erratic The first effort dramatic, And so well in that province He has never come off since. “Tasso's sad Lamentation” Much requires condensation; But 'tis plaintive and striking, And suits with my liking. Not so the sarcastic “Sketch on topics Domestic;” As the matter has ended, Least said's soonest mended. To Venice he hied him, And that city supplied him With the matter capricious For his “Beppo” facetious; A model, so please ye, Of a style free and easy. The story that's in it Might be told in a minute; But par parenthèse chatting, On this thing and that thing, Keeps the shuttlecock flying, And attention from dying. There are some I could mention, Think the author's intention Was to sneer and disparage The vow made in marriage; But the sneer, as I take it, Is 'gainst those folks who break it. The lengthy “Fourth Canto Of the Childe” makes us pant, oh! It exceeds altogether The three first in a tether; But 'tis greatly applauded, Yea, exceedingly lauded. Now, though, without flattery, It has powerful poetry, Yet the world henceforth will know Meo proprio periculo, That, to my mind, the style of it Is ambitiously elevate, Too much in the fashion Of a prize declamation; Rather pompous and dullish, Of falsetto, too, fullish; As it don't wholly please me, Of the subject I ease me. Thunders in now on horseback “Mazeppa” the Cossack; Though he was not a Hettman In performing that feat, man, And a wag, for his trouble, Call'd him John Gilpin's double. With many an ill-omen, 'Neath no publisher's nomen, (Proof that mischief was brewing) Sneak'd forth, of “Don Juan” Canto first, Canto second; But here my Lord reckon'd, His host unconsulted,— Staunch admirers revolted, And made a stern stricture On the profligate picture; E'en the wit could not save it From being upbraided; And, though read by the many, No one champion'd Giovanni. “The Great Doge of Venice” Little joy stirred within us; And the purse of Old Drury Was not burst, I assure ye, With the weight of the treasure, When, in spite of displeasure, And legal injunction, Abjuring compunction, This play they enlisted, And to act it persisted Till 'twas thoroughly hiss'd at. The “Three Cantos” more recent “Of Don Juan” are decent Compared with the couple, Of morals more supple, Which first made us wonder. But the three are much under Their loose brethren in satire, And in interesting matter; Though they shew more decorum, We could sooner snore o'er 'em. Last came to assail us Great “Sardanapalus,” “The Two Foscari's History,” And “Cain” in a “Mystery.” Had they staid in his pinnace On the waters of Venice, His fame had not suffer'd, For though they discover'd Some power in the terrible, They were not all agreeable. Cain's murderous fury He had best, I assure ye, Have left where he found it, Nor essay'd to expound it; For, howe'er he conceit it, We are bold to repeat it, He's by no means a fit one. To play pranks Holy Writ on. Milton's self, when he travell'd, From the record was gravell'd, In parts of his epic. So abstain from the topic, And with easy restriction Seek the regions of fiction, Extend thither your pinion, For there lies your dominion. L'Envoy. Lo! in melody worthy Of immortal Tom D'Urfey, Have I chanted, my lyre on, The doings of Byron. And, as faithful recorder, Chronological order Have I kept. Now, as clincher, I take heart, and will venture To suggest to his Lordship A proposal, (no hardship,) Which he should not be sorry at— Let him make me his Laureate. Royal Visit to Ireland. AUGUST XII., MDCCCXXI. I. The King's Landing. PROEMIUM. 1 The poet flabbergasted by ane strange apparition.As I was sitting on the Shannon side, Lull'd by the sound of that majestic flood, A horseman on a sudden I espied, Galloping by as quickly as he could; I hail'd him, but he slacken'd not his pace, Still urging on his steed, a gallant gray, Until he passed me, then he turned his face, Back towards his horse's tail, and thus did say,— “I ride express with news to strike you dumb, Our monarch has arrived at last—King George the Fourth is come!” 2 Which leaveth him in ane awkward doldrum, after the manner of W. Wordsworth, Esq.He scarce had spoken, ere away he pass'd Out of my sight as rapid as a bird, And left me there in much amazement cast, Looking, perhaps, in some degree absurd; The noble river rolling calmly by, The horse, the hasty rider, all did seem, Even to the vision of my outward eye, Like the thin shadowy figments of a dream; I felt, in short, as Wordsworth did, when he Chanced the leech gatherer on the moor all by himself to see. 3 Shaketh it off, and marcheth homewards.By the exertion of judicious thought, At last I from this mental trance awoke, Marvelling much how in that lonely spot, Upon my eyes so strange a vision broke; From the green bank immediately I went, And into Limerick's ancient city sped; During my walk, with puzzled wonderment I thought on what the rapid horseman said; And, as is commonly the case, when I Feel any way oppress'd in thought, it made me very dry. 4 When I arrived in brick-built George's-street, Turneth star-gazer. Instinctively I there put forth my hand To where a bottle, stored with liquid sweet, Did all upon an oaken table stand; Then turning up my little finger strait, I gazed like Doctor Brinkley on the sky, Whence heavenly thought I caught—pure and elate Of holy harpings of deep poesy; And, ere a moment its brief flight could wing, I threw the empty bottle down, to chant about the King. Ode. 1 A very glorious day this is indeed! He calleth upon Ireland to rejoice in the fashion of a pot of porter. This is indeed a very glorious day! For now our gracious monarch will proceed On Irish ground his royal foot to lay. Rejoice, then, O my country, in a tide Of buoyant, foaming, overflowing glee; As swells the porter o'er the gallon's side, So let your joy swell up as jovially; Shout, great and little people, all and some, Our monarch has arrived at last—King George the Fourth has come! 2 Come down, the mountains, bend your numbsculls low, Inviteth the mountains to ane saraband. Ye little hills run capering to the shore, Now on your marrow bones, all in a row, From all your caves a royal welcome roar. Howth is already at the water-side, Such is that loyal mountain's duteous haste; Come then to join him, come with giant stride, Come, I repeat, there's little time to waste; In your best suits of green depart from home, For now our monarch has arrived—King George the Fourth has come! 3 Makéth them ane catalogue most musical.Down should despatch Morne's snowy-vested peaks, And Tipperary, Knocksheogowna's hill, Kerry, the great Macgillycuddy's reeks, Cork, the Galtees, studded with many a still, Gallop from Wicklow, Sugarloaf the sweet! From Wexford, bloody Vinegar the sour! Croagh must be there, from whose conspicuous seat St. Patrick made the snakes from Ireland scour,— All, all should march, tramp off to beat of drum, For now our monarch has arrived—King George the Fourth has come! 4 A word of advice to the rivers, in the style of Master Edmund Spenser, late of Kilcolman.Rivers, dear rivers, in meandering roll, Move to your Sovereign merrily along; Ye whom the mighty minstrel of old Mole Has all embalmed in his enchanting song; Liffey shall be your spokesman, roaring forth A very neat Address from either Bull, While all the rest of you, from south to north, Shall flow around in currents deep and full, Murmuring beneath your periwigs of foam— “Our monarch has arrived at last—King George the Fourth has come!” 5 Anent lakes.Killarney sulkily remains behind, Thinking the King should come to wait on her; And if he wont, she swears with sturdy mind, That not one step to visit him she'll stir. But all the other loughs, where'er they be, From mighty Neagh, the stone-begetting lake, To Corrib, Swilly, Gara, Dearg, or Rea, Or Googaun-Barra, when the Lee doth take Its lovely course, join in the general hum— “Our monarch has arrived at last—King George the Fourth has come!” 6 O ye blest bogs, true sons of Irish soil, Lealty of the bogs. How can I e'er your loyal zeal express? You have already risen, despising toil, And travell'd up, your Sovereign to address. Clara has led the way, immortal bog, Now Killmalady follows in his train; Allen himself must soon to join them jog From Geashil barony, with might and main, In turfy thunders, shouting as they roam, “Our Sovereign has arrived at last—King George the Fourth has come!” 7 Ha! what's this woful thumping that I hear? Ane caution to the Giant's Causeway not to tread upon the learned weavers of Belfast. Oh! 'tis the Giant's Causeway moving on, Heavily pacing, with a solemn cheer, On clumsy hoofs of basalt octagon. (Gigantic wanderer! lighter be your tramp, Or you may press our luckless cities down; 'Twould be a pity, if a single stamp Smash'd bright Belfast—sweet linen-vending town.) Why have you travelled from your sea-beat dome? “Because our monarch has arrived—King George the Fourth has come!” 8 Last slopes in, sailing from the extremest south, Showing how Cape Clear becometh ane Marcus Tullius. Gallant Cape Clear, a most tempestuous isle; Certain am I, that when she opes her mouth She will harangue in oratoric style. So North, and South, and East, and West combine, Ulster, and Connaught, Leinster, Munster, Meath, To hail the King, who, first of all his line, Was ever seen old Ireland's sky beneath. All shall exclaim, for none shall there be mum, “Our monarch has arrived at last—King George the Fourth has come!” L'Envoy. 1 Mocke commendation on various folk.How living people joy, I shall not tell, Else I should make my song a mile in length; Plebeian bards that theme may answer well, Chanting their lays with pertinacious strength: They may describe how all, both man and beast, Have in the general glee respective shares; How equal merriment pervades the breast Of sharks and lawyers—asses and Lord Mayors— Of whelps and dandies—orators and geese— In short, of every living thing, all in their own degrees. 2 Where it is earnestly requested of the poets of Dublin, not to slay the King after the fashion of Ankerstroem or Ravillac.But ye, remorseless rhymesters, spare the King! Have some compassion on your own liege Lord! Oh! it would be a most terrific thing Were he to death by Dublin poets bored. See three sweet singers out of College bray, And all the aldermen have hired a bard, The Castle, too, its ode, I ween, will pay, And the newspapers have their pens prepared. Be silent, then, and mute, ye unpaid fry! Let none attempt to greet the King, save such great bards as I. II. A Welcome to His Majesty. Tune—Groves of Blarney. Synoptical Analysis for the benefit af Young Persons studying this Song. Stanza I. Welcome in general; in the following verses the specific excellencies of Ireland are stated. Stanza II. 1. National meat, and drink, and valour. Stanza III. 2. National riot in a superior style. Stanza IV. 3. National music. Stanza V. 4. National oratory. Stanza VI. 5. National gallantry. Stanzas VII. and VIII. National uproariousness. All these offered for the diversion of the King. 1 You're welcome over, my royal rover, Coming in clover to Irish ground; You'll never spy land, like this our island, Lowland or Highland, up or down! Our hills and mountains, our streams and fountains, Our towns and cities all so bright, Our salt-sea harbours, our grass-green arbours, Our greasy larders will glad your sight. 2 'Tis here you'll eat, too, the gay potato, Being a root to feed a king; And you'll get frisky upon our whiskey, Which, were you dumb, would make you sing; And you'll see dashers, and tearing slashers, Ready to face ould Beelzebub, Or the devil's mother, or any other Person whom you'd desire to drub. 3 Just say the word, and you'll see a riot Got up so quiet, and polite, At any minute you'd please to wish it, Morning or evening, noon or night. I'll lay a wager, no other nation Such recreation to you could show, As us, all fighting with great good manners. Laying one another down so low. 4 And as for music, 'tis you'll be suited With harp or bagpipe, which you please; With woful melting, or merry lilting, Or jovial quilting your heart to raise. Sweet Catalani won't entertain you With so much neatness of warbling tone, As those gay swipers, or bold bagpipers, Chanting in splendour over their drone. 5 Then there's our speaking, and bright speech-making, Which, when you hear, 'twill make you jump; When in its glory it comes before you, 'Twould melt the heart of a cabbage stump 'Tis so met'phoric, and paregoric, As fine as Doric or Attic Greek, 'Twould make Mark Tully look very dully, Without a word left in his cheek. 6 If any ladies, they should invade us, The darling creatures, in your suite, We'll so amuse them, and kindly use them, That in ould Ireland they'll take root. Our amorous glances, modest advances, And smiling fancies, and all that, Will so delight them, that they'll be crying, Were you to part them away from Pat. 7 The mayors and sheriffs, in paunchy order, And the recorders will go down To gay Dunleary, all for to cheer ye, And give you welcome to the town; But though their speeching it may be pleasing, All written out in comely paw, 'Twont be so hearty, as when all parties, With million voices roar Huzza! 8 God bless your heart, sir, 'tis you will start, sir, At that conspicuous thundering shout, When Ireland's nation, with acclamation, To hail their Sovereign will turn out. England shall hear us, though 'tis not near us, And the Scotch coast shall echo ring, When we, uproarious, joining in chorus, Shout to the winds, God Save the King! III. Odoherty's Impromptu. My landlady enter'd my parlour, and said,— “Bless my stars, gallant Captain, not yet to your bed? The kettle is drain'd, and the spirits are low, Then creep to your hammock, Oh go, my love, go! Derry down, &amp;c. “Do look at your watch, sir, 'tis in your small pocket 'Tis three, and the candles are all burn'd to the socket: Come move, my dear Captain, do take my advice, Here's Jenny will pull off your boots in a trice. Derry down,” &amp;c. Jenny pull'd off my boots, and I turn'd into bed, But scarce had I yawn'd twice, and pillow'd my head, When I dream'd a strange dream, and what to me befell, I'll wager a crown you can't guess ere I tell. Derry down, &amp;c. Methought that to London, with sword at my side, On my steed Salamanca in haste I did ride, That I enter'd the Hall, 'mid a great trepidation, And saw the whole fuss of the grand Coronation. Derry down, &amp;c. Our Monarch, the King, he was placed on the throne, 'Mid brilliants and gold that most splendidly shone; And around were the brave and the wise of his court, In peace to advise, and in war to support. Derry down, &amp;c. First Liverpool moved at his Sovereign's command; Next Sidmouth stepp'd forth with his hat in his hand; Then Canning peep'd round with the archness of Munden And last, but not least, came the Marquis of London- derry down, &amp;c. Then Wellington, hero of heroes, stepp'd forth; Then brave Graham of Lynedoch, the cock of the north; Then Hopetoun he follow'd, but came not alone, For Anglesey's leg likewise knelt at the throne. Derry down, &amp;c. But the King look'd around him, as fain to survey, When the warlike departed, the wise of the day, And he whisper'd the herald to summon in then The legion of Blackwood, the brightest of men! Derry down, &amp;c. Oh noble the sight was, and noble should be The strain, that proclaims, mighty legion, of thee! The tongue of an angel the theme would require, A standish of sunbeams, a goose quill of fire. Derry down, &amp;c. Like old Agamemnon, resplendent came forth, In garment embroider'd, great Christopher North; He knelt at the throne, and then turning his head,— “These worthies are at the King's service,” he said. Derry down, &amp;c. “Oh, Sire! though your will were as hard to attain, As Gibraltar of old to the efforts of Spain, The men who surround you will stand, and have stood, To the last dearest drop of their ink and their blood. Derry down, &amp;c. “From the Land's End to far Johnny Groat's, if a man, From Cornwall's rude boors to Mac Allister's clan, Dare raise up his voice 'gainst the church or the state, We have blisters by dozens to tickle his pate. Derry down, &amp;c. “We have Morris, the potent physician of Wales, And Tickler, whose right-handed blow never fails, And him, who from loyalty's path never wander'd, Himself, swate Odoherty, knight of the standard. Derry down, &amp;c. “We have sage Kempferhausen, the grave and serene; And Eremus Marischall from far Aberdeen; Hugh Mullion, the Grass-market merchant so sly, With his brethren Malachi and Mordecai. Derry down, &amp;c. We have also James Hogg, the great shepherd Chaldean, As sweetly who sings as Anacreon the Teian; We have Delta, whose verses as smooth are as silk; With bold William Wastle, the laird of that ilk. Derry down &amp;c. “We have Dr. Pendragon, the D.D. from York, Who sports in our ring his huge canvass of cork; And General Izzard, the strong and the gruff, Who despatches his foes with a kick and a cuff. Derry down, &amp;c. “We have Seward of Christchurch, with cap and with gown, A prizeman, a wrangler, and clerk of renown; And Buller of Brazen-nose, potent to seek A blinker for fools, from the mines of the Greek. Derry down, &amp;c. “Nicol Jarvie from Glasgow, the last, and the best Of the race, who have worn a gold chain at their breast; And Scott, Jamie Scott, Dr. Scott, a true blue, Like the steel of his forceps as tough and as true. Derry down, &amp;c. We have Cicero Dowden, who sports by the hour, Of all the tongue-waggers the pink and the flower; And Jennings the bold, who has challenged so long All the nation for brisk soda-water, and song. Derry down,” &amp;c. Methought that the King look'd around him and smiled; Every phantom of fear from his breast was exiled, For he saw those whose might would the demagogue chain, And would shield from disturbance the peace of his reign. Derry down, &amp;c. But the best came the last, for with duke and with lord, Methought that we feasted, and drank at the board. Till a something the bliss of my sweet vision broke— 'Twas the watchman a-bawling, “'Tis past ten o'clock.” Derry down, &amp;c. But before I conclude, may each man at his board Be as glad as a King, and as drunk as a lord; There's nothing so decent, and nothing so neat, As, when rising is past, to sit down on our seat. Derry down, &amp;c. IV. Translation of the Royal “Adventus.” 1 Muse! take up your joyful fiddle, And twang it pizzicato, But don't attempt the folks to diddle,— A fib I've nought to say to. Where's the use of telling stories, When you're to sing of so great glories, As foreigners, both Whigs and Tories, May wonder and cry “Nay!” to. 2 The coming of so great a King Would need lore to tell on: Madam! my tale's no common thing, It is one to think well on. For mighty powers it sure requires, The Dukes and Barons, Knights and Squires, Their grand processions and attires, That graced that day, to dwell on. 3 But fear won't further my design, Faint heart ne'er won fair lady, And want of pluck's no crime of mine, So I'll describe this gay day.— There is a village called Dunleary, Where all did crowd from far and near; I Ne'er saw the like—so loud and cheery, “God save the King!” they said aye. 4 Thither came Justices of Quorum, To punish any rash one, Who'd break the peace—and just before 'em I saw Lord Talbot dash on.— The Corporation tried to wedge in Bellies so huge you can't imagine! Midst men, wives, tailors, in a rage, in Order to learn the fashion. 5 The crowd was great! in number more Than sands upon the sea-shore! So much the folks their King adore, And love him without measure! They came to see and know the worth Of George the Good, of George the Fourth. The roads were cramm'd from south to north As full as they could be, sure. 6 Och! ye can't read the Book of Fate While standing there so weary, And thinking still, as it grows late, The King must sure be near ye. That King, whose much-desired arrival, Would give your wearied bones revival, Has changed his mind! Off ye may drive all, He won't come to Dunleary. 7 There is a harbour, Howth by name, That he'll for certain steam on; Stewart and Fate ye have to blame, For this which ye ne'er dream on. But pleasure oft comes after pain, You shall be christen'd o'er again; When he returns, he'll not disdain Your town his grace to beam on. 8 But now the ships began to fly Like swallows through the sea, ma'am, Or swim like fishes in the sky, As swift as swift could be, ma'am. And as they came still nigh and nigher, Hope made our hearts beat high and higher, And all cried out aloud, “I spy her; That surely must be she, ma'am!” 9 But Murraboo! This crowd of folks Will get a mighty take-in; They might as well have worn their cloaks, Their blue coats are mistaken. Past them the fleet doth swiftly sail, Their hopes and wishes can't prevail, And born on wings of steam and gale. Howth they their rest will make in. 10 Like hungry, disappointed Whigs, In vain for places praying; Like starving, desperate, gambling prigs Losing each bet they're laying; Like such, were all the doleful people— Like them, the female sex did weep all, When from their sight, they from the steeple Saw George their King astraying. 11 About two hundred Irish lads, Were standing on Howth height, ma'am, Whose heart sufficiently it glads, Far off to see the sight, ma'am, Of all the frigates, yachts, and steamers, And royal standards, flags, and streamers, About the King—They were not dreamers That he'd be there that night, ma'am. 12 But when they saw, that to their town, The Royal Navigator Approach'd—And when all bearing down Came boat, sloop, ship, first-rater— Lord! what a row the fellows raised! And how his Majesty they praised! The shout the very shores amazed! No King e'er caused a greater. 13 At length with fav'ring steam and gale, The Lightning safe did steer in; The crowd the Royal Ensign hail,— Each bright eye bore a tear in Token of joy! The foremost ranks Slid down a gangway from the banks: With silk they carpeted the planks— The King has stept on Erin! 14 Could I write melodies like Moore, Or ballads like Sir Walter, Or any such great poet, sure My strain should be no halter. I'd sing a song without a blunder, Should make posterity all wonder, And George's praise should sound like thunder, Before my voice should falter! 15 But since poor I am not the least Like them, a wight rhetorical, My reader's precious time to waste With Blarney a damn'd bore I call. But yet I needn't hold my tongue, I'll tell how round the King they hung, Although this story be not sung In language metaphorical. 16 Our gracious King to all the crowd His willing hand extended, And even the poorest Pat felt proud, So much he condescended. And willing hands the pockets picking, Gold watches grabbing, brass ones nicking, Made no distinction more than the King, Lest folks should feel offended. 17 Mounting the carriage steps with grace, “My friends,” he cried, “I thank ye!”— The coachman takes his reins and says, “My tits soon home shall spank ye.”— Than came the horsemen on with pride, Some of them their own chargers ride, While some paid half a crown a-side, And some had but a donkey. 18 The crowd increased as they went on, Because their hearts were loyal; They ran so fast their breath was gone, They scarce could speak for joy all. But of their great politeness judge, When they came to the Porter's Lodge, They not one other step would bodge, Because the grounds were royal. 19 But when the King cried “Come along, My friends, pray don't be frighted;” No sooner said than all the throng Rush'd on to where he lighted. Again at stepping on the ground, He shook the hands of all around, And made their hearts with joy rebound, When he with face delighted, 20 Exclaimed, “My soul is glad to day, My own dear Irish nation; I love you more than I can say, So great my agitation. I've loved you always—man and boy— And here I'm come, and will employ, To drink your health, without alloy, Of whiskey a libation.” 21 Thus said the King, and then the stair He royalty ascended. God save the King! through all the air, With four times four was blended! This being all I had to say, About this memorable day, Contentedly my pen I lay Down—for my tale is ended. Who wrote “The Groves of Blarney”? ‘Who,’—ask ye! No matter.—This tongue shall not tell, O'er the board of oblivion the name of the bard; Nor shall it be utter'd, but with the proud spell, That sheds on the perish'd their only reward. No, no! look abroad, Sir, the last of October; In the pages of Blackwood that name shall be writ, For Christopher's self, be he tipsy or sober, Was not more than his match, in wine, wisdom, or wit. Ye Dowdens and Jenningses, wits of Cork city, Though mighty the heroes that chime in your song, Effervescing and eloquent—more is the pity Ye forget the great poet of Blarney so long. I mean not the second, O'Fogarty hight, Who can speak for himself, from his own native Helicon I sing of an elder, in birth and in might, (Be it said with due deference,)—honest Dick Millikin. Then fill up, to his mem'ry, a bumper, my boys, 'Twill cheer his sad ghost, as it toddles along Through Pluto's dark alleys, in search of the joys That were dear upon earth to this step-son of song. And this be the rule of the banquet for aye, When the goblets all ring with “Och hone, Ullagone! Remember this pledge, as a tribute to pay To the name of a minstrel so sweet, so unknown HORACE, BOOK FIRST. ODE I. To Christopher North, Esq. Hail! Christopher, my patron, dear, Descended from your grandfather; To thee, my bosom friend, I fly, Brass buckler of Odoherty! Some are, who all their hours consume With well-train'd horse, and sweated groom,— Who, if the Doncaster they gain, Or, coming first, with lighten'd rein, At the St. Leger, bear away Elate the honors of the day, Pull up their collars to their ears, And think themselves amid the spheres. Such art thou, Lambton, Kelburne, Pierse, And more than I can name in verse. Another tries, with furious speech, The bottoms of the mob to reach;— Here on the hustings stands Burdett, With trope and start their zeal to whet; While jackall Hobhouse, sure to tire on Tracking alway the steps of Byron, Stands at his arm, with words of nectar Determined to out-hector Hector.— Preston, with rosin on his beard, Starts up, determined to be heard, And swears destruction to the bones Of those who will not hear Gale Jones: While Leigh Hunt, in the Examiner, About them tries to make a stir, And says, (who doubts him?) men like these Shame Tully and Demosthenes.— A third, like Sir John Sinclair, tries To hold the harrow to the skies; And thinks there is no nobler work, Than scattering manure with the fork, Except (as Mr. Coke prefers,) To catch the sheep, and ply the shears: Although you'd give, in guineas round, A plum, (i. e. one hundred thousand pound,) You could not get these men, I know, Aboard the Northern ships to go,— Through frozen latitudes to stroll, And see if ice surrounds the pole;— They wish success to Captain Parry, But yet, at home would rather tarry. In slippers red, before the fire, With negus to his heart's desire. The merchant sits; he winks and snores,— The north wind in the chimney roars: Waking, he bawls aloud—“Od rot 'em, “I fear my ships are at the bottom!— “The crews are trifles to be sure, “But then the cargos a'n't secure: “'Change will be changed for me to-morrow,— “Alack! for poverty and sorrow!” Men are—I know them—let that pass, (Who crack a joke, and love a glass) Whether, like Falstaff, it be sack, Champaigne, Old Hock, or Frontiniac, Or Whiskey-punch, which, jovial dog, Is true heart's-balsam to James Hogg;— Like Wordsworth, under pleasant trees, Some take delight to catch the breeze; Or lie amid the pastoral mountains, And listen to the bubbling fountains. Many in camps delight to hear The fife and bugle's music clear, While hautboy sweet, and kettle-drum, Upon the ear like thunder come. Though youngsters love a battle hot, Their anxious mothers love it not;— While in the fray a son remains out, Some erring ball may knock his brains out. O'er hedge and ditch, through field and thicket, With buck-skin breeches, and red jacket, On spanking steed the huntsman flies, Led by the deep-mouth'd stag-hounds' cries: Meanwhile his spouse, in lonely bed, Laments that she was ever wed; And, toss'd on wedlock's stormy billow, Like the M'Whirter, clasps her pillow, And sighs, while fondling it about. “Thou art my only child, I doubt!” —For me a laurel crown, like that Used for a band to Southey's hat, (Not such as Cockney Will abuses, And Leigh Hunt for a night-cap uses,) Would make me, amid wits, appear A Samson, and a grenadier! Then, many a nymph, with sparkling eye, Would crowd around Odoherty; Swift at the tune, which Lady Morgan Would play upon the barrel organ; MacCraws, and all my second cousins, And light-heel'd blue-stockings by dozens With nimble toe would touch the ground, And form a choral ring around.— Oh! that James Hogg, my chosen friend, His glowing fancy would me lend, His restless fancy, wandering still By lonely mount, and fairy rill! That Dr. Scott, with forceps stout, Would draw my stumps of dullness out; Exalt my heart o'er churlish earth, And fill me with his fun and mirth; Then, Anak-like, 'mid men I'd stray, Men, that like mice would throng my way, Rise high o'er all terrestrial jars, And singe my poll against the stars. ODE FIFTH, BOOK FIRST. To Molly M'Whirter. What Exquisite, tell me, besprinkled with civet, With bergamot, and l'huile antique a la rose, Now presses thee, Molly, (I scarce can believe it,) To march to the Parson, and finish his woes? For whom do you comb, brush, and fillet your tresses;— Whoever he be has not sorrows to seek; Thou daily shalt bring him a peck of distresses; Then kick him, and kiss a new gallant next week. He trusts that you'll love him, and doat on him ever, And thinks you a goddess reserved for himself; But, Molly, there's too much red blood in your liver, And antlers shall soon grace the poor silly elf. To some Johnny Raw thou wilt shine like a planet, For lecturing Magnus has left thee behind; And since I have escaped thee, (oh! blessings be on it,) I will hang up an old coat in St. Mary Wynd. ODE NINTH, BOOK FIRST. To Dr. Scott. Look out, and see old Arthur's Seat, Dress'd in a periwig of snow, Cold sweeps the blast down Niddry Street, And through the Netherbow. Sharp frost, begone! haste send the maid, With coals two shovels-full and more; Fill up your rummers, why afraid, And bolt the parlour door.— Leave all to Fortune, Dr. Scott, Though tempests growl amid the trees, While we have rum-punch smoking hot, We sha'n't most likely freeze. A fig about to-morrow's fare! A twenty thousand prize my buck, (Nay, do not laugh,) may be my share, Wont that be rare good luck? Doctor, I'm sure you'll toast the fair; Shame to the tongue would say me nay; You'll toast them, till the very hair Of your peruke turn grey. St. Giles's spire with snow is white, And every roof seems overgrown; Sharp winds that come, at fall of night, Down High Street closes moan; There, battering police officers, Hark! how the mad jades curse and ban While Polly cuffs some spoonie's ears, And cries, “Sir, I'm your man!”— O WEEP FOR ADONAIS, &amp;C. O weep for Wontner, for his leg is broke, O weep for Wontner, though our pearly tear Can never cure him. Dark and dimly broke The thunder cloud o'er Paul's enamelled sphere, When his black barb, with lion-like career, Scattered the crowd.—Coquetting Mignionet, Thou Hyacinth fond, thou Myrtle without fear, Haughty Geranium, in your beaupots set, Were then your soft and starry eyes unwet? The pigeons saw it, and on silver wings Hung in white flutterings, for they could not fly, Hoar-headed Thames checked all his crystal springs, Day closed above his pale, imperial eye, The silken zephyrs breathed a vermeil sigh, High Heavens! ye Hours! and thou Ura-ni-a! Where were ye then? Reclining languidly Upon some green Isle in the empurpled Sea, Where laurel-wreathen spirits love eternally. Come to my arms. &amp;c. ELEGY ON MY TOMCAT. “And others came—Desires and Adorations, Wing'd Persuasions, and veil'd Destinies, Splendours, and blooms, and glimmering Incantations Of hopes and fears, and twilight Phantasies; And Sorrow, with her family of Sighs; And Pleasure, blind with tears, led by the gleam Of her own dying smile instead of eyes!” ELEGY. Weep for my Tomcat! all ye Tabbies weep, For he is gone at last! Not dead alone, In flowery beauty sleepeth he no sleep; Like that bewitching youth Endymion! My love is dead, alas, as any stone, That by some violet-sided smiling river Weepeth too fondly! He is dead and gone, And fair Aurora, o'er her young believer, With fingers gloved with roses, doth make moan, And every bud its petal green doth sever, And Phœbus sets in night for ever, and for ever! And others come! ye Splendours! and ye Beauties! Ye Raptures! with your robes of pearl and blue; Ye blushing Wonders! with your scarlet shoe-ties; Ye Horrors bold! with breasts of lily hue; Ye Hope's stern flatterers! He would trust to you, Whene'er he saw you with your chesnut hair, Dropping sad daffodils; and rosepinks true! Ye Passions proud! with lips of bright despair; Ye Sympathies! with eyes like evening star, When on the glowing east she rolls her crimson car. Oh, bard-like spirit! beautiful and swift! Sweet lover of pale night; when Luna's lamp Shakes sapphire dew-drops through a cloudy rift; Purple as woman's mouth, o'er ocean damp; Thy quivering rose-tinged tongue—thy stealing tramp; The dazzling glory of thy gold-tinged tail; Thy whisker-waving lips, as o'er the swamp Rises the meteor, when the year doth fail, Like beauty in decay, all, all are flat and stale.” PACKING UP AFTER AN ENGLISH COUNTRY BALL. The clock has struck the midnight hour, and the chandeliers burn low, And the final couple are dancing down on somewhat wearied toe; Each belle now takes her partner's arm, who squires her to her seat, And chaperoning matrons talk right solemnly of heat. The gallery is clearing of the drowsy fiddlers twain; And he who blew the clarionet, with all his might and main, And he who made the tambourine ring and vibrate with his thumb, Have oped their eyes and stopp'd their yawns, for their release is come. The Ball at the Red Lion is, at last, then at an end; All agree it has been a pleasant night, as down the stairs they wend; And we'll descend along with them to see the ladies muffle Their finery in hoods and shawls, and in cloaks of serge and duffle. But oh! alas! and well-a-day! 'tis raining cats and dogs, And men and maids have brought umbrellas, pattens, boots, and clogs; And lest white satin shoes be soil'd, they supply some pairs of stouter, And lanterns, lest their mistresses should flounder in the gutter. The ladies rather wish, 'tis true, that the gentlemen were gone, And had left them to pack up their duds, at leisure and alone; But Captain Cartridge has engaged, and so has Ensign Sabre, To guard the three Miss Johnsons home, and their ancient maiden neighbour. So they're lolling on the table, waiting the damsels' hest,— Yet though these beaux so welcome are, it still must be confess'd, That Miss Amelia would prefer, while tugging her boot lace, That the Captain who's short-sighted, should not raise his quizzing glass, Come, little merry Mrs. Cushion is first and foremost ready, And stands in act to issue forth on her clicking pattens steady, With gown drawn through her pocket-holes, secure from dirt suburban, And with a safe-guard handkerchief, enveloping her turban. But see what's going on behind, where Emma Parkes is dressing! Sure young John Leigh's attentions are most marvellously pressing; With what an air of tenderness, he enshawls each ivory shoulder— An offer sure will come of this, ere he is twelvemonths older! At least so think the tabbies—and I see, Miss Prudence Herring, (Who, with sister Grace, is cloak'd to the chin, so at leisure to be peering,) Has had enough side-glances at this love-scene to instruct her How to frame on it by inference, a gossip's superstructure. But their tall prim niece is packing too, Miss Patience Prettyjohn, Demurely settling her calash those towering plumes upon: (Calashes are good things enough, when the weather's wet and muggy, But they make a woman's head look like the head of an old buggy.) “Well, sister Grace,” says Prue, “thank Heaven! our niece takes after us; You never find the men round her, making that odious fuss, Whispering such stuff! No, she can tie her cloak without assistance, For I've always told her—Patience dear! keep fellows at a distance. “Uphold your dignity, my love! The boldest men, you see,— The most presuming,—never take such liberties with me; Once when a suitor knelt to me, imagine, if you can, The air with which I waved my hand, and said, Begone, base Man! ‘That was a moment—oh, my dear! I felt exalted so In conscious virtue—Sister Grace! I've always preach'd, you know, Thus to our niece, and she, good girl, is an attentive hearer; Patience does keep the men in awe—observe, not one comes near her.” But hark! a strife—some silver pipes are pitch'd above the key, Which maiden's meekness best befits, and lady's courtesy; “'Tis mine,” resounds in tones so shrill, we cannot call them polish'd, And a bonnet seems to run the risk of being there demolish'd. For Julia Graves has seized it, and hers it is, she swears, And Mary Russell, chiding her, protests that is hers, And o'er Miss Julia's shoulder she darts her hand to snatch it, Who at arm's length holds the fragile prey, baffling her foe to catch it. “Miss Russell, you have spoilt my sleeve, what can be your design?” ‘I only mean to get, Miss Graves, what you have seiz'd of mine.’ “Yours, Ma'am?”—‘Yes, Ma'am,—this very day I pinn'd that ribbon on it— A very likely thing indeed I should not know my bonnet!’ “Pray, Ma'am, don't push so.” ‘Ma'am, you've pok'd your elbow in my eye.’ “That's your fault, Ma'am—I shan't let go.” ‘No, Ma'am, no more shall I—’ One should be more particular what company one's in, For really, some folks now-a-days think stealing not a sin; Things have walk'd off in the strangest way from routs and balls of late'— “You'd best take care, Ma'am, what you say—My Pa's a magistrate.” ‘Well, Ma'am, and what's your Pa to me?’—Then comes a desperate tustle, But the powers that guard meek innocence, keep watch for gentle Russell. For up comes Betty Chambermaid—“Here, ladies! arn't this he?” “What, that squabb'd thing? that's none of mine.” ‘That don't belong to me?’ Cry both at once—but—lights are brought—a second glance upon it, And poor Miss Julia's spirits fall—'tis sure enough her bonnet. Miss Russell triumphs loudly, nor spares recrimination; Her antagonist is cow'd beneath the deep humiliation. And she whining says, “I'm sure I thought”—‘Yes, Ma'am, I understand, Having lost your own, you thought you'd take the best that came to hand. Captain Cartridge has been enjoying this, and to the Ensign sware he That if it came to fisticuffs, he'd bet on tart Miss Mary; What a wreck of flowers and gauze had been the fruits of such contention! But the fates were kind and stopt the fray by Betty's intervention. While all this hubbub fills the room, Mrs. Moss heeds not the clash, But shawl'd, fur-tippeted, and glov'd, and with head in huge calash, She wants but one protection more to save her silks and satins, And her little footboy's on his knees to mount her on her pattens. Mind, Tommy, mind, 'tis a tender job—press gently, 'twill not suit To handle with a clumsy paw an ancient lady's foot. Oh! the matron twists, for the awkward chit has hit upon a corn, Which has laugh'd her nostrum, ivy leaves and vinegar, to scorn. A start is made—umbrellas flap and rustle as they spread, And, the threshold past, the pattering rain beats on them overhead; The bespattered beaux have hard ado to wield these bucklers light, For while they guard the ladies left, the gusts assail their right. The noise of pattens waxeth faint, as homeward-bound they travel, Now clattering on the pavement-stones, now grinding in the gravel; This dies—though ever and anon, the listening ear is roused, By some front-door's slam betokening a party snugly housed. The lanterns, which so brightly stream'd, have vanish'd one by one, As a lane was turn'd, or a rat-tat-tat announced the journey done; And a few were on a sudden quench'd by puffs of winds uproarious, Envious of those “earth-treading stars” which made dark night so glorious. But who encounter'd these mishaps—and who caught cold and fever— And who drest well—and who drest badly spite of best endeavour— And what new lights in love or hate, from the meeting we must borrow, We shall learn at length when we call upon our partners fair to-morrow. The Wine-Bibber's Glory—A New Song. Tune—The Jolly Miller. Quo me, Bacche, rapis tui Plenum? ? ? Dulce periculum est O Lenæe! sequi Deum? Cingentem viridi tempora pampino. —Hor. 1 If Horatius Flaccus made jolly old Bacchus So often his favourite theme; If in him it was classic to praise his old Massic, And Falernian to gulp in a stream; If Falstaff's vagaries, 'bout Sack and Canaries, Have pleased us again and again; Shall we not make merry on Port, Claret, Sherry, Madeira, and sparkling Champagne? 2 First Port, that potation, preferr'd by our nation To all the small drink of the French; 'Tis the best standing liquor, for layman or vicar, The army, the navy, the bench; 'Tis strong and substantial, believe me, no man shall Good Port from my dining-room send; In your soup—after cheese—every way—it will please, But most tête-a-tête with a friend. 3 Fair Sherry, Port's sister, for years they dismiss'd her, To the kitchen to flavour the jellies— There long she was banish'd, and well-nigh had vanish'd To comfort the kitchen-maids' bellies— Till his Majesty fixt, he thought Sherry when sixty Years old, like himself, quite the thing— So I think it but proper, to fill a tip-topper Of Sherry to drink to the King. 4 Though your delicate Claret by no means goes far, it Is famed for its exquisite flavour; 'Tis a nice provocation, to wise conversation, Queer blarney, or harmless palaver; 'Tis the bond of society—no inebriety Follows a swig of the Blue; One may drink a whole ocean, nor e'er feel commotion, Or headache from Chateau Margoux. 5 But though Claret is pleasant, to taste for the present, On the stomach it sometimes feel cold; So to keep it all clever, and comfort your liver, Take a glass of Madeira that's old: When 't has sail'd to the Indies, a cure for all wind 'tis, And colic 'twill put to the rout; All doctors declare, a good glass of Madeira, The best of all things for the gout. 6 Then Champagne! dear Champagne! ah! how gladly I drain a Whole bottle of Oeil de Perdrix; To the eye of my charmer, to make my love warmer, If cool that love ever could be, I could toast her for ever—But never, oh! never, Would I her dear name so profane; So if e'er when I'm tipsy, it slips to my lips, I Wash it back to my heart with Champagne! Critique on Lord Byron. “Claudite jam rivos, pueri, sat prata biberunt.” —Virg. So the Public at length is beginning to tire on The torrent of poesy pour'd by Lord Byron! Some guess'd this would happen:—the presage proved true. Then now let us take a brief, rapid review Of all, or at least of each principal topic, Which serves as a theme for his muse misanthropic. First, note we the prelude, which sung by the Minor, Gave promise of future strains, bolder and finer; Though the bitter Scotch critic loud raised his alarum, And swore men and gods could not possibly bear 'em! To the fame of the bard men have given a shove— Whate'er may be judged of his merits above. Thus stung, did the youngster assail, we must own, Some names which his fury had well let alone; As a colt, who a thistle beneath his tail feels, At all things around madly launches his heels. Yet blithely, though sharply, the young minstrel caroll'd, To Reviewers and Bards, ere he croak'd with Childe Harold, That wight, who, in endless Spenserian measure, Roams through the wide world without object or pleasure; Till at last, we find out, with the pilgrim proceeding, That we gain no great object nor pleasure in reading! But, first, with what glee did all palates devour The fragments, which bear the strange name of the Gaiour? 'Tis a tale full of pathos, and sweet is the verse:— Would some pains in connecting have render'd it worse? Then next was our caterer pleased to provide us With an exquisite treat in the Bride of Abydos;— Zuleika, so lovely—so simple—so tender— Yet firm,—from her purpose no danger could bend her. Sour critics may say, all this praise duly granting, There seems in the plan probability wanting. By what happy means could these lovers contrive, With Giaffer's suspicions so warmly alive, Of the Harem's strict bondage to lengthen the tether, And so pleasantly take their amusements together? Of Eastern seràis, though not versed in the fashions, We've heard, in those climates, where boil all the passions, No youth could approach, howe'er prudent they thought her, The sacred retreat of his own father's daughter.— Such objections are dull;—'tis a pity to show 'em, If adherance to fact would have spoil'd a good poem. Now swift in his bark sails stout Conrad, the Corsair, To surprise Seyd Pashà, with his three tails of horse-hair. But the destinies order—unlucky mishap! That Conrad, not Seyd, should be caught in the trap. Those minds must be steel'd with an apathy rare, Which mourn not Medora, nor sigh for Gulnare. Medora, soft Queen of the Island of Thieves, Whose heart, too susceptible, bursts as it grieves! The woes of Gulnare, too—we feelingly share 'em— The pride, though the cold passive slave of Seyd's harem:— But touch'd by the robber, she mounts to the class Of dames whose whole soul is inflammable gas. Though caught was the Corsair, the fates had decreed That this foe, though in chains, should be fatal to Seyd. Ah! sensitive reader, 'tis hard to persuade ye, That man could be cool to so kind a fair lady— When we knew her warm heart, of his terrible fate full, Risk'd all for his safety—'twas somewhat ungrateful! And since such great hazard she ran for his sake, Could his fancy prefer writhing spik'd on a stake, To giving—(but Poets are full of their fibs) The savage Pasha a deep thrust in the ribs! Such delicate scruples we prize at a high rate— They seem rather squeamish, perhaps, in a pirate! Quick vanishes Conrad:—bold rover, adieu! But who is this Lara, that starts into view? If Conrad thou art, as some people suppose, Gloomy chief, thou'rt less qualmish with friends, and with foes! If strong were the “stuff o' thy conscience,” oh say How was Ezzelin so snugly put out of the way? We see, too, the spirit and warmth of Gulnare in That feminine page, so attach'd and so daring; And we shrewdly suspect that the small crimson spot On her amazon forehead is nearly forgot. 'Tis true, when the Corsair old Seyd's palace saw burn, The Queen of his harem had ringlets of auburn;— That the page's are black contradicts not our guesses— Since ladies sometimes change the hue of their tresses. Then tack'd to this story, strange mixtures, are seen, Those dullest of stanzas 'yclep'd Jacqueline. Alas! for poor Rogers—'twas certainly hard To be made, as a compliment, foil to a bard Who needs no such foil—so unapt too to flatter! 'Twere better have borne the worst lash of his satire! Yet of high-season'd praise he is sometimes the organ, This Shelley can witness, and eke Lady Morgan. Shall Roger's name be inscribed in this set Whose former bright laurels none wish to forget? But Jacqueline sues for the garland in vain, For Memory here brings us nothing but pain. Can the laud be much relish'd by Gifford and Crabbe, Which is shared by the crazy-brain'd muse of Queen Mab? Would Dryden or Otway, or Congreve, or Pope, Sweet Burns, or the Bard who delights us with Hope, Be flatter'd to find they were join'd in this melée, And placed cheek by jole with dame Morgan and Shelley? Next scowls the fell wizard, hight Manfred the bold, Who broods over sins which wont bear to be told. 'Tis a drama repulsive, but still it has force.— How well does he paint the sharp pangs of remorse! That quill which seems pluck'd from the wing of a raven, Gives a touch almost worthy the poet of Avon. Are the pictures from fancy?—fictitious or real? Surely Satan himself is the bard's beau ideal! Yet 'tis strange that each image that glides through his lanthorn From Juan, whose joy is on husbands to plant horn, Who views with delight tears of damsels deluded,— To the wretch who hates all things, himself too included,— All in some striking feature each other resemble, As in Hamlet, or Rolla, we still saw John Kemble. If the draughts smack of nature, we care not a straw Where he finds the dark model he chooses to draw. Of smaller effusions I pass over loads— The Family Sketch—Hebrew Melodies—Odes;— Sad Tasso's Lament—soft occasional Verses— And levell'd at Elgin stern Pallas's curses; Mazeppa's long race, that intrepid rough-rider,— And adieus to a Lady, whose Lord can't abide her. Within two blue paste-boards what contraries meet— The fragrant, the fetid, the bitter, the sweet:— Like a garden neglected these fences enclose The violet, the nettle, the nightshade, the rose. But amongst these sarcastic and amorous sallies, Who marks not that effort of impotent malice, Aim'd at worth placed on high—nay, the most lofty station, Whose strongest, best guard, is the love of a nation. Far wide from its mark flew the shaft from the string, Recoils on the archer, but wounds not the King:— He smiles at such censures when libellers pen 'em— For Truth bids defiance to Calumny's venom, We know 'tis the nature of vipers to bite all— But shall Byron be preacher of duties marital? Now to poems we turn of a different nature, Where harangues Faliero, the Doge, and the traitor. The Doge may be prosy:—but seldom we've seen a Fair Lady more docile than meek Angiolina. Yet to move us her griefs don't so likely appear, as The woes the starved Poet has made Belvidera's. I'm far from asserting we're tempted to laugh here;— But the Doge must be own'd not quite equal to Jaffier. These ancient impressions the fancy still tarries on, When forced with old Otway to make a comparison. Oh! best, tuneful Peer, shone your genius dramatic Ere your Muse set her foot on those isles Adriatic! Let her shun the Rialto, and halls of St. Mark, Contented with Manfred to rove in the dark. On the banks of Euphrates you better regale us, With the feasts and the frolics of Sardanapalus. Philosophic gourmand!—jolly, libertine sage! Only Pleasure's soft warfare determined to wage, With goblet in hand, and his head crown'd with roses, He teaches that death everlasting repose is. The tenet may fairly belong to the story; But here we perceive that 'tis preach'd con amore. This volatile heart Grecian Myrrha could fix, Though he laughs at her creed about Pluto and Styx. His love she returns when his virtues she conn'd over, And was true, e'en to death, when she found him so fond of her But the sot whom his subjects had rated at zero, Bravely fights, and then dies in a blaze like a hero! You can next (for stage magic you're ne'er at a loss) carry Your friends back to Venice, and show them the Foscari. To these luckless isles we're transported again! Lo! a youth harshly judged by the Council of Ten, Most wilfully rushes on horrible tortures, Lest in some foreign clime he should take up his quarters! His hatred invincible tow'rds all the men is, But he doats with strange love on the mere mud of Venice. For the Doge—there is no known example will suit us; His phlegm patriotic out-Brutuses Brutus. In his chair, whilst the rack's wrenching torments are done, He watches the pangs of his innocent son. His nerves such a spectacle tolerate well; Yet he dies by the shock, when the sound of a bell, On a sudden, to Venice announces the doom, That another mock-sovereign reigns in his room. Now last, though not least, let us glance at the fable Your Lordship has raised on the murther of Abel. But chiefly that wonderful flight let us trace, Which Lucifer wings through the regions of space; Where with speed swift as thought with his pupil he runs, Threading all the bright maze of the planets and suns; And lectures the while all these objects they're viewing, Like a tutor abroad, who leads out a young Bruin. Thus, Satan exhibits pre-Adamite spectres, And lays down his maxims there free from objectors. How we turn with disgust, as we listen'd with pain, From the vile metaphysics he whispers to Cain! Fit talk for the fiend and the fratricide felon,— But this is a subject too hateful to dwell on;— A lash light as mine, grave offences can trounce ill— Then here let me end with a short word of counsel:— 'Twould be wrong, noble Bard, Oh! permit me to tell ye, To establish a league with Leigh Hunt and Bysshe Shelley; Already your readers have swallow'd too much, Like Amboyna's swollen victims when drench'd by the Dutch. The world cries, in chorus, 'tis certainly time To close up your flood-gates of blank verse and rhyme. Hold! Hold!—By the public thus sated and cramm'd, Lest your lays, like yourself, stand a chance to be d?d! Modern English Ballads. No. 1.—Spring's Return. Rise up, rise up, my Morgan, lay the foaming tankard down, Rise up, come to the window, and gaze with all the town. From gay shin-bone and cleaver hard the marrowy notes are flowing, And the Jew's-harp's twang sings out slap-bang, 'twixt the cow-horn's lordly blowing; And greasy caps from butchers' heads are tossing everywhere, And the bunch of fives of England's knight wags proudly in the air. Rise up, rise up, my Morgan, lay the foaming tankard down, Rise up, come to the window, and gaze with all the town. Arise, arise, my Morgan, I see Tom Winter's mug, He bends him to the Fancy coves with a nod so smart and smug; Through all the land of great Cockaigne, or Thames's lordly river, Shook champion's fist more stout than his, more knock-me-downish never. Yon Belcher twisted round his neck of azure, mix'd with white, I guess was tied upon the stakes the morning of the fight. Rise up, rise up, my Morgan, lay the foaming tankard down, Rise up, come to the window, and gaze with all the town. What aileth thee, my Morgan? what makes thine eyes look down? Why stay you from the window far, nor gaze with all the town? I've heard thee swear in hexameter, and sure you swore the truth, That Thomas Spring was quite the king of the first-beshaking youth. Now with a Peer he rideth here, and Lord Deerhurst's horses go Beneath old England's champion, to the tune of Yo, heave ho! Then rise, oh rise, my Morgan, lay the foaming tankard down, You may here through the window-sash come gaze with all the town. The Irish Ensign rose not up, nor laid his tankard down, Nor came he to the window to gaze with all the town; But though his lip dwelt on the pot, in vain his gullet tried, He could not, at a single draught, empty the tankard wide. About a pint and a half he drank before the noise grew nigh, When the last half-pint received a tear slow dropping from his eye. No, no, he sighs, bid me not rise, nor lay my tankard down, To gaze on Thomas Winter with all the gazing town. Why rise yet not, my Morgan, nor lay your tankard down? Why gaze ye not, my Morgan, with all the gazing town? Hear, hear the cheering, how it swells, and how the people cry, He stops at Cribb's, the ex-champion's shop;—why sit you still, oh! why? “At Cribb's good shop let Tom Spring stop, in him shall I discover The black-eyed youth that beat the lad who cross'd the water over? I will not rise with weary eyes, nor lay my tankard down, To gaze on Langan's conqueror, with all the gazing town.” No. 2.—The Lament for Thurtell. A loud Lament is heard in town—a voice of sad complaining— The sorrow Whig is high and big, and there is no restraining. The great Lord Mayor, in civic chair, weeps thick as skeins of cotton, And wipes his eyes with huckaback, sold by his own begotten. Alas, says he, thy thread of life is snapt by sheers of Clothor And a winding sheet, a yard-yard-wide, enwraps thee, O, my brother! Howl, buff and blue! of that dear crew, whose brows the patriot myrtle Shades for Harmodius Thistlewood! Howl, howl for Whig Jack Thurtell! The doves and rooks who meet at Brooks', sob loudly, fast, and faster, And shake in skin as rattlingly as they ere shook the castor. O, by the box of Charley Fox, and by his unpaid wagers, Shame 'tis, they swear, for hangman cocks to hang our truest stagers; What if he cut the fellow's throat in fashion debonnaire, sir, 'Tis only like our own Whig case, a bit the worse for wear, sir; What if, after swallowing brains and blood, he ate pork chops like turtle, Sure, don't we swallow anything? Alas! for Whig Jack Thurtell! Lord Byron, gentleman is he, who writes for good Don Juan, Huzzaed when my Lord Castlereagh achieved his life's undoing. No Tory bard, that we have heard, so savage was or silly, As to crow o'er cut-throat Whitbread Sam, or cut-throat Sam Romilly. We laugh at them—they sighs with us—we hate them sow and farrow— Yet now their groans will fly from them as thick as flights of arrow, Which Mr. Gray, in ode would say, through the dark air do hurtle,— Moaning in concert with ourselves—Alas! for Whig Jack Thurtell! He was a Whig—a true, true Whig— all property he hated In funds or land, in purse or hand,—tithed, salaried, or estated. When he saw a fob, he itch'd to rob, the genuine whiggish feeling; No matter what kind was the job, fraud, larceny, cheating, stealing. Were he a peer our proud career he'd rule in mansion upper, In the Lower House, behind him Brougham would amble on the crupper, Like Bennet Grey, or Scarlett J. he'd wield the poleaxe curtal (My rhymes are out) 'gainst Ministers! Alas! for Whig Jack Thurtell! Moore-ish Melodies. 1.—THE LAST LAMP OF THE ALLEY. The last lamp of the alley Is burning alone! All its brilliant companions Are shivered and gone. No lamp of her kindred, No burner is nigh, To rival her glimmer, Or light to supply. I'll not leave thee, thou lone one! To vanish in smoke; As the bright ones are shattered, Thou too shalt be broke: Thus kindly I scatter Thy globe o'er the street; Where the watch in his rambles Thy fragments shall meet. Then home will I stagger, As well as I may; By the light of my nose sure I'll find out the way. When thy blaze is extinguished, Thy brilliancy gone, Oh! my beak shall illumine The alley alone. 2.—'TIS THE LAST GLASS OF CLARET. 'Tis the last glass of Claret, Left sparkling alone, All its rosy companions Are clean'd out and gone. No wine of her kindred, No Red Port is nigh, To reflect back her blushes, And gladden my eye. I'll not leave thee, thou lone one, This desert to crown: As the bowls are all empty, Thou too shalt float down. Thus kindly I drink up Each drop of pure red, And fling the bright goblet Clean over my head. So soon may dame Fortune Fling me o'er her head, When I quit brimming glasses, And bundle to bed. When Champaigne is exhausted, And Burgundy's gone, Who would leave even Claret, To perish alone. 3.—RICH AND RARE. Rich and rare was the chain he wore, And a long white wand in his hand he bore; But oh! his paunch strutted far beyond His bright gold chain, and his snow-white wand. “Oh, Alderman, dost thou not fear to go, Where the turtle shall smoke, and the Burgundy flow? Are the doctors so sparing of lancet and pill, Not to physic or bleed thee for this night's swill? ” “Good ma'am,” said he, “I feel no alarm; Nor turtle nor Burgundy does me a harm; For though of your doctors I've had a score, I but love good eating and drinking the more.” On he went—and his purple nose Soon over dish, platter, and bottle glows: And long may he stuff, who thus defied Lancet, pill, bolus, and potion beside. 4.—TOM STOKES LIVED ONCE. “Young Love.” Tom Stokes liv'd once in a garret high Where fogs were breathing, And smoke was wreathing Her curls to give the cerulean sky, Which high up above Tom's head did lie: His red cheeks flourish'd, For Sam Swipes nourish'd Their bloom full oft with Whitbread's showers. But debts, tho' borish, must be paid, And Bailiffs a'nt bam'd for many hours. Ah! that the Nabman's evil eyes Should ever come hither, Such cheeks to wither! The fat soon, soon, began to die, And Tom fell sick as the blades drew nigh. They came one morning, Ere Stokes had warning, And rapp'd at the door where the wild spark lay. ‘Oh, ho!’ says Tom, ‘Is it you?’ good bye.— So he pack'd up his awls, and he trudg'd away. 5.—BILLINGSGATE MUSIC. Hark! Billingsgate music Melts o'er the sea, Falling light from some alehouse, Where Kerry men be; And fishwomen's voices Roar over the deep, And waken around us The billows from sleep. Our potatoe boat gently Wades over the wave, While they call one another Rogue, baggage, and knave! We listen—we listen— How happy are we, To hear the sweet music Of beauteous Tralee! 6.—TO A BOTTLE OF OLD PORT. 1 When he, who adores thee, has left but the dregs Of such famous old stingo behind, Oh! say will he bluster or weep; no, ifegs! He'll seek for some more of the kind. He'll laugh, and though doctors perhaps may condemn, Thy tide shall efface the decree, For many can witness, though subject to phlegm, He has always been faithful to thee! 2 With thee were the dreams of his earliest love, Every rap in his pocket was thine, And his very last prayer, every morning, by Jove, Was to finish the evening in wine. How blest are the tipplers whose heads can outlive The effects of four bottles of thee, But the next dearest blessing that heaven can give, Is to stagger home muzzy from three! 7.—TO THE FINISH I WENT. 1 To the Finish I went, when the moon it was shining, The jug round the table moved jovially on; I staid 'till the moon the next morn was declining— The jug still was there, but the punch was all gone! And such are the joys that your brandy will promise, (And often these joys at the finish I've known) Every copper it makes in the evening ebb from us, And leaves us next day with a headache alone! 2 Ne'er tell me of puns or of laughter adorning Our revels, that last till the close of the night, Give me back the hard cash that I left in the morning, For clouds dim my eye, and my pocket is light. O! who's there who welcomes that moment's returning, When daylight must throw a new light on his frame— When his stomach is sick, and his liver is burning, His eyes, shot with blood, and his brow in a flame! The Route. “Send for a chair—it blows so hard—I can't bear windy weather; Now, you and I in one sedan can go quite well together,” Said Mrs. Frump, while folding tight her shawl around each shoulder, She took the lean and wither'd arm of sweet Miss Nancy Holder. This Mistress Frump and Nancy dear were old maids stiff and stupid, Who long had been shot proof against the darts of cunning Cupid; So now, good souls, they both were off to Lady Betty Randle, To have a little shilling whist, and talk a deal of scandal. The chair it came, and in they went, together sideways sitting, As closely pack'd as all the threads they just before were knitting. In minutes three they safe arrived, the double knock foretelling The fast approach of these two dames to Lady Randle's dwelling. Forthwith the bawling footman shewed up stairs Miss Nancy Holder, And Mrs. Frump; while stared Miss Young, and Mrs. Young the older. “Dear Lady Randle, how d'ye do? I am very glad to see you,” Quoth Mrs. Frump. Miss Sugarfist cried, “Dear Miss Nan, how be you?” “Miss Charlotte, I am quite rejoiced to have the boundless pleasure Of shaking hands, my love, you're looking charming beyond measure; That roseate bloom upon your cheek outvies the soft carnation.” “O lawk! Miss Ann, you fluster me with such great admiration.” Now, Mr. Sugarfist had been in tea and figs a dealer, Which was the cause Miss Sugarfist, his child, was not genteeler; He, having made a fortune large, and trade no more admiring, Sold all his stock, and cut the shop and business, by retiring. Yet still he dealt—that is, the cards, for he to whisk was partial; His partner now, a soldier bold, was gallant Major Martial, Who oft had seen much service hard, round Brentford, Kew, and Ryogate, And e'en that very day had march'd from Paddington to Highgate. By Mr. Sugarfist there sat, of turtle feasts a giver, A Nabob, who came home with gold, but not an inch of liver; His partner was no less a man than portly Parson Sable; Which, if you reckon right, you'll find just makes up one whist table. But next to these, a noisy set of talking Dames were playing At guinea Loo, and now and then a temper vile betraying. Miss Winter, Mrs. Crookedlegs, Miss Glum, and Mrs. Hearty, With hump-back'd Lady Spindlehanks, exactly made the party. Upon the sofa, Mrs. Frump, dear soul! had squatted down to Some shilling whist, with Mrs. Prim, and lo! a foreign Count, too! Who, as Dame Fortune will'd it, soon became her partner chosen; While Mr. Prim, congenial man! sat opposite Miss Frozen. Around the room, in various parts, some motley groups were seated: In one place, Captain Splinter bold, with grape (not shot) juice heated, Made desp'rate work with Sophy Blaze, who swore he meant to kill her; For, in the warmth of love, he grasp'd her hand just like a tiller. Then, in the room adjacent, young Miss Randle and Miss Parking, To treat the company, began through two duets sky-larking. When Mr. Simple ask'd Miss Quiz, “In what key are they playing?” “'Tis what you are,—A flat,” she said, a sneering smile betraying. Now up and down the ivory keys the Misses twain kept flying. As if to make as great a din as could be they were trying. This o'er, the kind Miss Symphony, with lungs indeed appalling, Sat down before the harpsichord, and had a bout at squalling. While all these things were going on, Miss Holder, in a corner, Had fix'd upon a school girl, Miss Honoria Julia Horner, Who'd just begun to be come out; so Nancy, by explaining The histories of the folks around, Miss H. was entertaining. “Look there! d'ye see? that's General Bomb, just come from Gibraltar; 'Tis rumour'd he will lead next week Miss Simper to the altar: He's sixty-five, and she sixteen,—a pretty match this, truly! No doubt, in time his brow will be with antlers cover'd duly. “There goes Miss Flirt, who fancies she is able to discover In every man she dances with a true and ardent lover. And here comes Mrs. Paroquet, a widow young and wealthy, Who's waiting just to catch some peer, old, gouty, and unhealthy. “That kind of man with whiskers large, and hair that's rather sandy, A stiff cravat, gold chain and glass, is what they call a Dandy. Those ladies standing by the door, and making such wry faces, Because they've lost twelve points at cards, are call'd the faded Graces. “The youngest's only fifty-eight, the second sixty-seven; The oldest, who is seventy-six, ought now to be in—heaven. Folks say they once were pretty girls, but would be always flirting; A thing, my dear, the hopes of being nicely married hurting. “Now, goodness me! as I'm alive! there's little Fanny Sawyer Engaged in earnest chat with Mr. Honesty, the lawyer. If that turns out to be a match, I'm sure 'twill be a wonder. But only look at Mrs. Bounce with one-arm'd Colonel Thunder. “Well, how some people can!—but see, the card parties are breaking, And yonder there's dear Mrs. Frump of tipsey-cake partaking.” So here Miss Holder's eloquence at once was put an end to, At sight of delicacies, which she ever was a friend to. Now Champagne bottles, knives and forks, plates, glasses, scandal, chatter, With laughter interspersed, began to make a glorious clatter. “Dear Colonel, pray be good enough to help me to a custard”— “A little lobster, if you please”—“I'll thank you for the mustard. “Miss Holder, won't you take a seat?”—“What shall I have the pleasure, Miss Sugarfist, of giving you?”—“Why, when you be at leisure, I'll take some raisins, if you please.”—“That savours of the Grocer,” Miss Clackitt whispered Mr. Prim, “her dad was one, you know, sir.” Now Mr. Prim, alas! poor man! was very absent, making Sometimes great blunders, which would after set his heart an aching: Thus sage Miss Clackitt's shrewd remark to him was quite a poser, Yet, just for answering's sake, he roar'd out, “Yes, her dad's a grocer!” On which Miss Charlotte's cheeks, poor thing, became as red as scarlet, And pouting like a sulky child, she sobb'd out, “O the varlet!” But he, the cause of her dismay, stood looking blank and foolish; While Dandy Bubble said, “Why, Prim, upon my soul! 'twas coolish.” Now other noises swell'd the roar: Good gracious! what's the matter? “O never mind, 'tis Sophy Blaze, again the Captain's at her:— I wonder if these rattling romps will end in ought like marriage!”— “Lord Random's Stanhope stops the way”—“Count Marasquino's carriage.” Then rose among the female tribe a strife of silk and satins, Miss Holder's chair's announced, and Mrs. Bubble's maid and pattens. In groups the company paired off; some chairing it, some walking, But all fatigued with doing nought, save playing cards and talking. As home our brace of old maids went, each passing watchman's warning, Proclaim'd, “Past two;” said Mrs. Frump, “Dear me, 'tis Sunday morning! Well, who'd have thought it! what a shame! now is it not, Miss Nancy? I wish we'd come away before.” (She told a lie, I fancy.) But here to this my beauteous strain, at length I must say, Amen, And bid adieu to Lords and Counts, to Ladies gay, and gay Men; And much I hope, although these things sometimes should not be slighted, When next her Ladyship's “at home,” I may not be invited. A Happy New-Year. 1 Hark! hark! the sharp voice of Old Christopher North Rings out from Edina, the gem of the Forth: The year twenty-three like a vapour has past, And he's nearer by one twelvemonth more to his last. He dreads not that day—for he trusts he has stood, Though too freakish at times, yet in all by the good; So he watches the march of Old Time without fear, And wishes you, darlings, a Happy New-Year. 2 He greets you, because the dear bond of our love Is flourishing proudly all others above; Her sons still as manly, her daughters as true— [He speaks of the many, and mourns for the few—] That she still is the realm of the wise and the free, Of the Victors of Europe, the Lords of the Sea— And gratitude dims his old eyes with a tear, While he wishes you, darlings, a Happy New-Year. 3 His heart sings with joy, while all round him he sees Her citizens prosper, her cities increase,— Her taxes diminish,—her revenues rise,— Her credit spring up, as her oaks to the skies,— Her coasts full of commerce,—her purses of gold,— Her granary with corn, and with cattle her fold. He prays that for aye such may be her career, And wishes you, darlings, a Happy New-Year. 4 He is proud to see Monarchs bend low, cap in hand, To ask aid from her merchants, plain men of our land, To see them their millions so readily fling, And book down as debtor an Emperor or King: That a nod from her head, or a word from her mouth, Shakes the World, Old and New, from the North to the South; That her purse rules in peace, as in war did her spear, And he wishes you, darlings, a Happy New-Year. 5 Laugh, fiddle, and song, ring out gay in the town, And the glad tally-ho cheers the dale and the down; The rich man his claret can jollily quaff, And the happier poor man o'er brown stout may laugh; And the demagogue ruffian no longer can gull With Jacobin slang, for John's belly is full; And 'tis only when hungry that slang he will hear— So, Kit wishes you, darlings, a Happy New-Year. 6 He rejoices to see every engine at work, From the steamer immense, to the sweet knife and fork; The weaver at loom, and the smith at his forge; And all loyal and steady, and true to King George. Whigs, therefore, avaunt! there's no chance now for ye— We forget they exist in the general glee; He begs you won't let them diminish your cheer, So he wishes you, darlings, a Happy New-Year. 7 There's the King, bless his heart, long is likely to live, And the Duke at the head of the army to thrive; There's Wellington extant, who badger'd the Gaul, And Eldon still sitting in Westminster-Hall. There's Scott writing prose—and there's—who writing verse? Why, no one; but, hang it, think never the worse. Sure, there's Christopher North writes your Magazine here, And wishes you, darlings, a Happy New-Year. 8 In the midst of this wealth, of this national pride— Of our honour, our glories, spread far, far, and wide, While proudly we traverse the sea and the sod, Let us never forget for a moment our God! It was he raised us up, and, remember, his frown, If we swerve from his cause, would as soon cast us down; But that so we shall swerve shall Old Kit never fear, And he wishes you, darlings, a Happy New-Year. Parody on Wordsworth. My heart leaps up when I behold A bailiff in the street: 'Twas so since from one first I ran; 'Twas so even in the Isle of Man; 'Twill be so even in Newgate's hold, Or in the Fleet! A trap is hateful to a man! And my whole course in life shall be Bent against them in just antipathy! FRAGMENTS. [I never saw a more delightful spot!—] I never saw a more delightful spot!— One might have lain there, when the days were hot, Hours and hours—hark'ning to the sweet singers Up in the leaves—twiddling one's thumbs and fingers— Watching the sun-beams in that quiet scenery, Spangling about the jaunty greenery, And the small flies and gnats—that sort called midges, Bite one confoundedly, raising long ridges Upon one's skin.—Oh! it were sweet, most sweet, As I before said, in the summer heat, To lie there sprawling flat upon one's back, Dozing and dreaming of one's—Zounds! what's that?— Pshaw! a cockchafers—what was I saying?— Oh; that would be delicious, thus a laying, To dream of ? [They were not married by a mutt'ring priest] They were not married by a mutt'ring priest, With superstitious rites, and senseless words, Out-snuffled from an old worm-eaten book In a dark corner (railed off like a sheep-pen,) Of an old house, that fools do call a Church! Their altar was the flowery lap of earth— The starry empyreum their vast temple— Their book, each other's eyes—and Love himself, Parson, and Clerk, and Father to the bride!— Holy espousals! whereat wept with joy The spirit of the Universe.—In sooth There was a sort of drizzling rain that day, For I remember (having left at home My parapluie, a name than umbrella Far more expressive,) that I stood for shelter Under an entry not twelve paces off, (It might be ten,) from sheriff Waithman's shop, For half an hour or more, and there I mused, (Mine eyes upon the running kennel fixed, That hurried on a het'rogenous mass To th' common-sewer, its dark reservoir,) I mused upon the running stream of life. But that's not much to th' purpose—I was telling Of those most pure espousals.—Innocent pair! Ye were not shackled by the vulgar chains About the yielding mind of credulous youth, Wound by the nurse and priest,—your energies, Your unsophisticated impulses, Taught ye to soar above their “settled rules Of Vice and Virtue.”—Fairest creature! He Whom the world called thy husband, was in truth Unworthy of thee.—A dull plodding wretch! With whose ignoble nature, thy free spirit Held no communion.—'Twas well done, fair creature! T' assert the independence of a mind Created—generated I would say— Free as “that chartered libertine, the air.” Joy to thy chosen partner!—blest exchange! Work of mysterious sympathy! that drew Your kindred souls by ? [Come, and you'll find the muffins hot] Come, and you'll find the muffins hot, And fragrant tea in the tea-pot, And she, you know, with the taper fingers, Shall pour it out for you—Wherefore lingers My friend so long? where can he be? Didn't he promise he'd come to tea? Ah! there's his knock—the very cat knows 'tis— Now we'll be snug and toast our noses, Now we ? [There fled the noblest spirit—the most pure] There fled the noblest spirit—the most pure, Most sublimated essence that e'er dwelt In earthly tabernacle. Gone thou art, Exhaled, dissolved, diffused, commingled now Into and with the all-absorbing frame Of Nature the great mother. Ev'n in life, While still pent up in flesh and skin, and bones, My thoughts and feelings like electric flame Shot through the solid mass, towards their source, And blended with the general elements, When thy young star o'er life's horizon hung Far from its zenith yet, low lagging clouds (Vapours of earth) obscured its heav'n-born rays— Dull fogs of prejudice and superstition, And vulgar decencies begirt thee round; And thou didst wear awhile th' unholy bonds Of “holy matrimony!”—and didst vail Awhile thy lofty spirit to the cheat.— But reason came—and firm philosophy, And mild philanthropy, and pointed out The shame it was—the crying, crushing shame, To curb within a little paltry pale The love that over all created things Should be diffusive as the atmosphere. Then did thy boundless tenderness expand Over all space—all animated things, And things inanimate. Thou hadst a heart, A ready tear for all—The dying whale, Stranded and gasping—ripped up for his blubber, By Man, the tyrant—The small sucking pig Slain for his riot—The down-trampled flower, Crushed by his cruel foot—All, each and all Shared in thy boundless sympathies, and then— (Sublime perfection of perfected love) Then didst thou spurn the whimp'ring wailing thing That dared to call thee “husband,” and to claim, As her just right, support and love from thee,— Then didst thou ? [Pretty little playful Patty] Pretty little playful Patty Daddy's darling! fubsy fatty! Come and kiss me, come and sip, Little bee upon my lip— Come, and bring the pretty ship, Little brother Johnny made ye, Come, ye little cunning jade ye, Come and see what I've got here, In my pocket, pretty dear! What! and won't ye come no higher? Want to go to aunt Marier? Want to go to ? [Oh! lay me when I die] Oh! lay me when I die Hard by That little babbling brook, where you and I Have sat, and sauntered many a summer's day, Scenting the sweet soft hay; There let me lay, For there young mincing May Comes first with mouth so meek, And pale peach-coloured cheek, And little naked feet, That go pit pat, And all that, Tripping among the sweet Daisies and violets, And pale primroses; And there she comes and sits A tying up of posies Fit for immortal noses To sniff unto, and there With silky swaling pair, And iv'ry hands that wring it, And to the zephyrs fling it, Up from that babbling brook The little Naiad's look, Heaving up round white shoulders, That dazzle all beholders, And then so graceful glide they, Some crablike (sidling) sideway; Then on the bank I mention, Like turtles at Ascension, In heaps they're all a laying, And then with pretty playing, One, like a frightened otter, Flopps down into the water; The rest they flounce in a'ter— Then some, with pea-green blushes, Hide in amongst the rushes, And one lies shamming sleep, And one squeaks out “bo peep!” And one raised head doth peer Out with a laughing leer; And then pops up another; Another and another; Then they pretend to smother, A titt'ring talk conquettish, Then with affected wonder, And feigned frowns so pettish, Like ducks they dive down under, Then through the gurgling water, To look and see ? Song of the Sea. “Woe to us when we lose the watery wall!” Timothy Tickler. If e'er that dreadful hour should come—but God avert the day! When England's glorious flag must bend, and yield old Ocean's sway; When foreign ships shall o'er that deep, where she is empress, lord; When the cross of red from boltsprit-head is hewn by foreign sword; When foreign foot her quarter-deck with proud stride treads along; When her peaceful ships meet haughty check from hail of foreign tongue;— One prayer, one only prayer, is mine, that, ere is seen that sigh, Ere there be warning of that woe, I may be whelm'd in night. If ever other prince than ours wield sceptre o'er that main, Where Howard, Blake, and Frobisher, the Armada smote of Spain; Where Blake, in Cromwell's iron sway, swept tempest-like the seas, From North to South, from East to West, resistless as the breeze; Where Russell bent great Louis' power, which bent before to none, And crush'd his arm of naval strength, and dimm'd his Rising Sun— One prayer, one only prayer is mine—that, ere is seen that sight, Ere there be warning of that woe, I may be whelm'd in night! If ever other keel than ours triumphant plough that brine, Where Rodney met the Count De Grasse, and broke the Frenchman's line, Where Howe, upon the first of June, met the Jacobins in fight, And with Old England's loud huzzas broke down their godless might; Where Jervis at St. Vincent's fell'd the Spaniards' lofty tiers, Where Duncan won at Camperdown, and Exmouth at Algiers— One prayer, one only prayer, is mine—that, ere is seen that sight, Ere there be warning of that woe, I may be whelm'd in night! But oh! what agony it were, when we should think on thee, The flower of all the Admirals that ever trod the sea! I shall not name thy honoured name—but if the white-cliff'd Isle Which rear'd the Lion of the deep, the Hero of the Nile, Him who, 'neath Copenhagen's self, o'erthrew the faithless Dane, Who died at glorious Trafalgar, o'er-vanquished France and Spain, Should yield her power, one prayer is mine—that, ere is seen that sight, Ere there be warning of that woe, I may be whelm'd in night! SECOND EPODE OF HORACE DONE IN A NEW STYLE. Blest man! who far from busy hum, Ut prisca gens mortalium, Whistles his team afield with glee Solutus omni fœnore: He lives in peace, from battles free, Neq' horret iratúm mare; And shuns the forum, and the gay Potentiorum limina. Therefore to vines of purple gloss Alta maritat populos, Or pruning off the boughs unfit Feliciores inserit; Or in a distant vale at ease Prospectat errantes greges; Or honey into jars conveys, Aut tondet infirmas oves. When his head decked with apples sweet Autumnus agris extulit At plucking pears he's quite au-fait Certant, et uvam purpuræ. Some for priapus, for thee some Sylvane, tutor finium! Beneath an oak 'tis sweet to be Mod' in tenaci gramine: The streamlet winds in flowing maze; Queruntur in sylvis aves; The fount in dulcet murmur plays Somnos quod invitet leves. But when the winter comes (and that Imbres nivesque comparat) With dogs he forces oft to pass Apros in obstantes plagas; Or spreads his nets so thick and close, Turdis edacibus dolos; Or hares, or cranes, from far away Jucunda captat præmia: The wooer love's unhappy stir Hæc inter obliviscitur. His wife can manage without loss Domum et parvos liberos; (Suppose her Sabine, or the dry Pernicis uxor Appuli.) Who piles the sacred hearthstone high Lassi sub ad-ventúm viri. And from his ewes, penned lest they stray, Distenta siccet ubera; And this year's wine disposed to get Dapes inemptas apparet. Oysters to me no joys supply, Magisve rhombus, aut scari. (If when the east winds boisterous be Hyems ad hoc vertat mare) Your Turkey pout is not to us, Non attagen Ionicus. So sweet as what we pick at home Oliva ramis arborum; Or sorrel, which the meads supply, Malvæ salubres corpori— Or lamb, slain at a festal show, Vel hædus ereptus lupo. Feasting, 'tis sweet the creature's dumb, Videre prop'rantés domum, Or oxen with the ploughshare go, Collo trahente languido; And all the slaves stretched out at ease, Circum renidentes Lares. Alphius the usurer, babbled thus, Jam jam futurus rusticus, Called in his cash on th' Ides—but he Quærit Calendis ponere. The Crabstick. Air—The Green Immortal Shamrock. Through Britain's isle as Hymen strayed Upon his ambling pony, With Buller sage, in wig arrayed, To act as cicerone, To them full many a spouse forlorn Complained of guineas squandered, Of visage torn and breeches worn, And thus his godship pondered— Oh, the Crabstick! the green immortal Crabstick! I'll ensure A lasting cure In Russia's native Crabstick! With magic wand he struck the earth, And straight his conjuration Gave that same wholesome sapling birth, The husband's consolation; Dispense, quoth he, thou legal man, This new-discover'd treasure, And let thy thumb's capacious span Henceforward fix its measure. Oh, the Crabstick! the green immortal Crabstick! Long essay'd On jilt and jade Be Buller's magic Crabstick! The olive branch, Minerva's boon, Betokens peace and quiet, But 'tis sage Hymen's gift alone Can quell domestic riot; For 'tis a maxim long maintain'd By doctors and logicians, That peace is most securely gain'd By armed politicians. Oh, the Crabstick! the green immortal Crabstick! Its vigorous shoot Quells all dispute, The wonder-working Crabstick! In idleness and youthful hours, When graver thoughts seem stupid, Men fly to rose and myrtle bowers To worship tiny Cupid; But spliced for life, and wiser grown, Dog-sick of sighs and rhyming. They haunt the crab-tree bower alone, The leafy shrine of Hymen. Oh, the Crabstick! the green immortal Crabstick! Love bestows The useless rose, But Hymen gives the Crabstick! Sonnet. I stood upon St. Peter's battlement, And my eye wander'd o'er Imperial Rome, And I thought sadly on the fatal doom 'Neath which her ancient palaces had bent; Of temple and tower outrageously uprent, Or mouldered into dust by slow decay: Of halls where godlike Cæsar once bore sway, Or glorious Tully fulmin'd eloquent! So shall all earthly sade! what wonder then, If Time can make such all-unsparing wreck, If neither genius, art, nor skill of men, Can e'en pretend his felon-hand to check, That this old coat, I've worn these three years past, Should on each elbow want a patch at last? [The setting sun with crimson beam] 1. The setting sun with crimson beam Now gilds the twilight sky; And evening comes with sportive mien, And cares of daylight fly; Then deck the board with flow'rs, and fill My glass with racy wine; And let those snowy arms, my love, Once more thy harp entwine. Oh! strike the harp, my dark hair'd love, And swell that strain so dear; Thine angel form shall charm mine eye, Thy voice delight mine ear. 2. The glasses shine upon the board, But brighter shines thine eye; The claret pales its ruby tint, When lips like thine are nigh; The tapers dim their virgin white Beside thy bosom's hue; And the flame they shed burns not so bright, As that I feel for you. Then strike the harp! each note, my love, Shall kindle fresh desire; Thy melting breath shall fan that flame, Thy glowing charms inspire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. IV. Homeric Ballads and Translations, AND Comedies of Lucian. HOMERIC BALLADS. I. The Bath of Odysseus. FROM THE ODYSSEY.—Book XIX. 386–507. I A caldron bright the old woman bore, To wash the stranger's feet; Of water cold she poured in store— Then, to temper the bath, she filled it o'er With a stream of boiling heat. II By the fire Odysseus took his place; But he quickly turned him round In the darksome shadow to hide his face, For he thought that his nurse's hand would trace The scar of an ancient wound. III And he feared that she might with outcry rash His presence there betray; And scarcely had she begun to wash, Ere she was aware of the grisly gash Above his knee that lay. IV It was a wound from a wild boar's tooth, All on Parnassus' slope, Where he went to hunt in the days of his youth With his mother's sire, with whom, in sooth, In craft could no man cope. V By Hermes' grace, with oaths and lies His fraudful game he played; And the god, for the blazing sacrifice Of kids' and lambkins' savory thighs, Lent him his ready aid. VI From Parnassus erst on a journey gone, To Ithaca's isle he came; There he found that his daughter had borne a son, Whom they placed his grandsire's knees upon, As he sate at the board, his supper done, And they asked him the boy to name. VII And thus spoke out Euryclea fair, The infant's nurse was she— “Autolycus, name thy daughter's heir, Whom thou long hast sought with many a prayer, Now lying upon thy knee.” VIII “Daughter and son,” the old man said, “What name I bestow, receive; As many a man, o'er earth wide-spread, Was odious to me when I hither sped, Be Odysseus the name I give. IX “By such a surname my grandson call; And when manhood's years shall come, Send him to visit the ample hall, Where his mother was born, in Parnassus tall, And there I shall give him share of all, And send him rejoicing home.” X Seeking these treasures rich and rare, Odysseus left his land; To Autolycus' castle he made repair, And his grandsire, and his uncles there, Hailed him with friendly hand. XI And the heart of his mother's mother was blest With her dear grandson's sight; Closely she clasped him to her breast, And many a kiss on his cheek she prest, And on his eyes so bright. XII Then Autolycus told his sons to spread A table for the feast; And willing they did as their father said, And a five-year-old steer was to slaughter led In honor of their guest. XIII They flay off its hide, they dress the inside, They cut it up joint by joint; With skill well tried, the flesh they divide, And, sliced into steaks, to the fire applied, Pierced on the toaster's point. XIV And when at the fire it was fully done, Due portions they gave to all; They sate at the meal until set of sun, And when they rose, complaint was there none Of the well-shared festival. XV When the sun in night had hid his ray, They sank in slumber sound; Until the rose-fingered queen of day Sprang from the dawn where her birthplace lay, And wakened man and hound. XVI And all at once the chase pursued Grandson, and son, and sire; They climbed the mountain crowned with wood, And soon in the windswept lawns they stood, Whence Parnassus' heights aspire. XVII Uprose the sun from the deep, deep stream Of ocean's gentle swell, And the fields were warmed by his genial gleam, When the huntsmen, by light of the matin beam, Entered the woody dell. XVIII First through the covert burst the pack, Fast following on the trace; Came the Autolyci at their back, Nor did they find Odysseus slack, With spear in hand, to join the attack, Or urge along the chase. XIX There 'neath thick covering branches laid, A huge boar had his lair; So dense the foliage of that glade, No wind had ever pierced its shade, On moist wing wafted there. XX There never in the midday heat Was the warm sunbeam seen; So sheltered was that close retreat, That never did a rain-storm beat Athwart its leafy screen. XXI And deep all round, the thick-strew ground With leaves was covered o'er; But the trampling sound of man and hound, All bursting in with sudden bound, Aroused the couchant boar. XXII With bristling back, and eye of flame, In the brake he took his stand; To the onset first Odysseus came, Raising his spear with steady aim, Poised in his sinewy hand. XXIII Ready he stood right valiantly But, ere he had time to strike, The tusk of the boar, more prompt than he, Deep through his flesh, above the knee, Ripped with a stroke oblique. XXIV Sharp was the wound, but it touched no bone; Odysseus then made a thrust; Through the right shoulder his spear has gone, Through the off side piercing its point has shone; And the slaughtered beast, with bellowing moan, Sunk dead into the dust. XXV The Autolyci looked to the boar that was slain, And their nephew's gash they bound. They stanched the black blood by a magic strain, And brought him home to their sire again, And they healed him of his wound. XXVI With presents rich he was sent away, When his cure was all complete; Joyful they parted, both he and they, And to Ithaca's isle he bent his way, His parents glad to greet. XXVII And much of his wound they wished to know, And his manner he did recount, How a white-tusked boar had dealt the blow, While hunting he chanced with his uncles to go, Upon Parnassus' mount. XXVIII Well was it known by that woman old, The instant she touched the scar; Down dropped his foot from her slackened hold, Upset was the laver, and over it roll'd, Clanging with brazen jar. XXIX All on the floor did the water pour. The old woman's heart beat high; With joy at once, and with sorrow sore, Her soul was filled, and, brimming o'er, Tears dimmed her aged eye. XXX And her voice in her throat was prisoned fast, But ere long the words outburst; Her suppliant hand to his chin she passed, And she said, “Thou art he—I know thee at last— The darling boy I nurst! XXXI “I knew thee not, Odysseus, till Thy skin my hand had pressed.” Then where the queen was seated still Cast she her eyes, with eager will, To tell who was the guest— XXXII To say that her husband home returned, Now sate within her bower. But her looks Penelope nought discerned, For the thoughts of her mind elsewhere were turned, By Athené's watchful power. XXXIII Odysseus checked her tongue's career; Her throat his right hand caught; Then with his left he drew her near, And “Nurse,” said he, in tone severe, “Dost thou my ruin plot? XXXIV “Thou plot my ruin! by whose teat My infancy was fed; When homeward to my native seat, After twenty years of toil and sweat, My wandering course has led! XXXV “Now, since to thee my coming here By a god's aid is known, Breathe it to none that I am near; For, mark me, with attentive ear, Threatening what shall be done— XXXVI “If, by Heaven's help, beneath me die The suitors whom I hate, Not even to thee, my nurse, shall I Yield quarter, while around me lie The handmaids, slain unpityingly, Within my palace gate.” XXXVII Him answered thus Euryclea good: “What hast thou said, my son? Firm and inflexible of mood, I hold thy secret, unsubdued, As steel or solid stone, XXXVIII “But, heed my words. If Heaven should tame The suitors b'neath thy hand, Then throughout the household shall I name The handmaids who wrought disgrace and shame, And those who blameless stand.” XXXIX “Needless, my nurse,” the king replied, “That this should to me be told; They all shall be noted, and duly tried. As for the rest, let the gods provide: But do thou deep silence hold.” XL She went to prepare the bath anew, For the first was split all round: He was bathed and anointed in manner due; To the fire then closer the stool he drew, And over his knee his rags he threw, In order to hide the wound. II. The Song of the Trojan Horse. SUNG TO ULYSSES BY THE MINSTREL DEMODOCUS. FROM THE ODYSSEY.—Book VIII. 477–534. I “Here, herald,” he said, “take this portion of meat, And bear it from me, that the minstrel may eat; Although sad is my heart, yet I gladly will give The honor that bards should from all men receive; For honor and reverence should ever belong To the loved of the Muses, the framers of song.” So spoke forth Odysseus—the herald obeyed, And his gift was at once by Demodocus laid. II The minstrel received it, rejoicing in heart, Then the feast was begun, and they all took a part; And when sated with meat and with wine was each guest, By Odysseus the singer again was addressed: “The lot of no other I honor as thine; For the Muse taught thy lay, or Apollo divine; Thy song of th' Achivi tells truly and well, How they toiled in the wars, how they fought and they fell. III We would think 'mid those deeds that thou present hast been Or hast heard them from one who the combat had seen. Be the famed Horse of Wood now renowned in thy lays, Which Athené assisted Epéus to raise. How brought by Odysseus, with stratagem bold, It was placed, full of men, within Ilion's stronghold. This tale truly sing; and my tongue shall maintain, O'er the earth, that a god has inspired thy sweet strain.” IV The minstrel began as the godhead inspired, He sang how their tents the Argives had fired, And over the sea in trim barks bent their course, While their chiefs with Odysseus were closed in the horse, Mid the Trojans, who had that fell engine of wood Dragged on, till in Troy's inmost turret it stood; There long did they ponder in anxious debate, What to do with the steed, as around it they sate. V Then before them three several counsels were laid, Into pieces to hew it by edge of the blade; Or to draw it forth thence to the brow of a rock, And downward to fling it with shivering shock; Or, shrined in the tower, let it there make abode, As an offering to ward off the anger of God. The last counsel prevailed, for the moment of doom, When the town held the horse, upon Ilion had come. VI The Argives in ambush awaited the hour, When slaughter and death on their foes they should shower. When it came from their hollow retreat rushing down, The sons of the Achivi smote sorely the town. Then scattered, on blood and on ravaging bent, Through all parts of the city chance-guided they went, And he sang how Odysseus at once made his way To where the proud domes of Deiphobus lay. VII With bold Menelaus he thitherward strode, In valor an equal to war's fiery god. There fierce was the fight, dread the deeds that were done, Till, aided by Pallas, the battle he won. So sang the rapt minstrel the blood-stirring tale, But the cheek of Odysseus waxed deathly and pale; While the song warbled on of the days that were past, His eyelids were wet with the tears falling fast. VIII As wails the lorn bride, with her arms clasping round Her own beloved husband, laid low on the ground; From the town, with his people, he sallied out brave, His country, his children, from insult to save. She sees his last gasping, life ready to part, And she flings herself on him, pressed close to her heart. Shrill she screams o'er the dying, while enemies near Beat her shoulders and back with the pitiless spear. IX They bear her away—as a slave she must go; For ever a victim of toil and of wo. Soon wastes her sad cheek with the traces of grief: Sad as hers showed the face of famed Ithaca's chief. But none saw the tear-drops which fell from his eye, Save the king at the board who was seated close by; And Alcinous watched him, and noted alone, How deep from his breast came the heavy-sent groan. III. The Return of the Chiefs from Troy. FROM THE ODYSSEY—Book III. 66–200. I The tables were set where the salt-sea shore Was washed by the flowing brine, And all the guests, when the feast was o'er, Were filled with meat and wine. II Then the Knight of Gerene said, “'Tis fit That we should truly hear Who are the guests that among us sit, Since now they are full of cheer. III “Strangers, who are ye? whence and why Sail ye along the sea? Do you your course as merchants ply, Or as roving wanderers free? IV “As pirates who over the waters spread, On desperate venture boune, Putting other men's lives in peril and dread, All careless of their own?” V Then Telemachus answered the chieftain old, With courage at his heart; For Athené herself a bearing bold Did to the youth impart, VI That he might ask for his absent sire, And win for himself high fame: “King Nestor,” said he, “as thou dost inquire, Great pride of th' Achaian name, Our business and course, at thy desire, I tell thee whence we came. VII “From Ithaca's land we hither steer, All under Neion's head; No public care has brought us here, But private feeling led. VIII “My father I seek, if his wide renown, I may find as I take my way; Odysseus the bold, to thee well known, Thy partner in war, till Ilion town Before ye in ruin lay. IX “The fate of every chief beside Who fought at Troy is known; It is the will of Jove to hide His untold death alone. X “And how he fell can no man tell; We know not was he slain In fight on land by hostile hand, Or plunged beneath the main. XI “And here I pray, before thy knee, To tell my sire's sad fate; What thou hast seen, or else to thee Did wayfarers' tongues relate: Because for sorrow marked was he, Even from his birth-hour's date. XII “No pitying word, no tale to soothe, From thee do I require; I only pray thee tell me truth, If thou hast seen my sire. XIII “I pray thee by his words well said, His deeds right bravely done; By many a gallant promise made, And broken never a one. XIV “Be the woes and toils which he and thou, And all the host went through In Troy's long war, remembered now, And tell me the story true.” XV Answered Gerene's knight: “Why call My memory back again, To griefs, there destined to befall Achaia's tameless men? XVI “Whether their course o'er the dark blue sea Our wandering vessels sped, Scouring the coast for spoil and prey Where'er Achilles led; XVII “Or fighting around King Priam's hold Proud Ilion's turrets high; Brave Aias there in death lies cold, There does Achilles lie; XVIII “There has Patroclus found his grave, In council sager none; There lies the blameless and the brave, Antilochus, my son. XIX “My swift of foot, my bold of fight, My dear, dear boy, lies low; But living wight can ne'er recite Our endless tale of wo. XX “Wert thou here to abide, for a twelvemonth's tide Told five or six times o'er, Question on question might still be tried Of the ills the Achavi bore, XXI “Ere home thou wouldst sail, fatigued with the tale Of our nine years' constant toil While we wrought for our foemen grief and bale, With many a varied wile. XXII “Till the weary siege, by Jove's high will, Was brought to an end at last: In warrior craft and wily skill No chief thy sire surpassed. XXIII “If great Odysseus be thy sire— And as on thee I gaze Wondering, the likeness I admire Thy speech to his betrays. XXIV “Thou must be his. How else suppose That ever man so young, Could speak in accents like to those Of wise Odysseus' tongue? XXV “And he and I, in friendship bound, Often in council state; Oft, 'mid the Greeks assembled round, We mingled in debate: XXVI “We never differed, felt no jar, Our counsels still were one, Planning what should throughout the war Be best for the Argives done. XXVII “But when o'erthrown was Priam's town, And we sought the ships again, Then the Achaian host, into discord thrown, Were scattered upon the main. XXVIII “Their home return had Jove designed To fill with sorrow sad, To punish the men of reckless mind, And of feelings base and bad. XXIX “Through high-born Pallas' deadly ire Many an ill death died; For, 'twixt the Atridæ of quarrel dire She had the source supplied. XXX “They assembled the host of the Argives all, And a rash hour they set; As the shades of night began to fall, The unruly soldiers met. XXXI “For heavily laden they came with wine, And by both chiefs were told, In several speech, with what design Did they that meeting hold. XXXII “And Sparta's king wished across the seas They should straight return again; But this counsel did not his brother please, Who would the host detain, XXXIII “Till they had made the offering due Of sacred hecatomb; By sacrifice hoping to subdue Athené's wrathful gloom. XXXIV “Fool! that his vows were thrown away Unthanked—he should have known; For the heart of the gods who live for aye Is not to changing prone. XXXV “Fierce were the angry words they spoke, These jarring brothers proud; And the Achivi up from the meeting broke Rising in clamor loud. XXXVI “And as seemed best in each man's sight, Each different side he sought; And we lay down to rest that night With bitter and hostile thought; For Jove had willed that foul despite Should be to the Danai wrought. XXXVII “And we launched our ships when the morning came, With our well-won treasure stored; And many a fair, deep-girdled dame We took with us on board. XXXVIII “And half of the men desired to stay, As Agamemnon bade; The other half we sailed away, And a rapid voyage we made. A god the vasty sea-deep spray Smooth as a plain had laid. XXXIX “When we had come to Tenedos' isle, We made our offerings there— Hoping, now danger passed and toil, We soon should homeward bear. XL “But Jove was sternly minded still To lengthen out our woes; And by his will of strife the ill Again among us rose. XLI “For some retraced again the seas, Plying back the laboring oar, Thinking their ancient chief to please Whom they left on the Ilian shore; And, led by king Odysseus, these Sought the coast of Troy once more. XLII “But when I saw the evils dread Some angry power had planned, With the crowded galleys I there had led Beneath mine own command, Away I fled—away with me fled Bold Diomed and his band. XLIII “By Menelaus, at evening tide, We were in Lesbos joined; While pondering how, through the waters wide, We best our path might find. XLIV “Whether we should over Chios hold Our course, and toward Psyria go, Leaving Chios and all its headlands bold Under our larboard bow; XLV “Or under Chios, where Mimas' head Is swept by many a gale. To the gods for a guiding sign we prayed To point our course to sail. XLVI “They gave the sign, and bade us steer Right over the sea across, Making Eubœa in full career, So shunning wreck and loss. XLVII “Shrill did the wind begin to blow, As through the fishy deep, Cleft by our vessel's rapid prow Onward our way we keep. XLVIII “Geræstus' haven by night we made, And the thigh of many a bull We there on Posidon's altar laid, Of grateful reverence full. XLIX “Grateful that we a track so vast Safe crossed of the ocean blue; And ere the fourth day was gone and passed Came Argos' towers in view, And Diomed's men his ships at last Into his harbor drew. L “I held on to Pylos, mine own abode, And never flagged the gale From the hour that it was the will of the God That it should fill my sail. LI “So came I hither knowing naught, Which of the Achaian host Were back, my son, in safety brought, And which of them were lost. LII “But what, since I have dwelt at home, Hath chanced to reach my ear, Of all my old companions' doom, 'Tis fit that thou shouldst hear. LIII ‘Well did the spear-famed Myrmidon Homeward return, 'tis said, Beneath Achilles' glorious son, Back to his country led. LIV “Well, also, Pœas' ancient seat Did Philoctetes gain; Well did Idomeneus, of Crete, Bring back of his warrior train Those who chanced not death in fight to meet; None perished on the main. LV “Though far off ye may dwell, ye have heard men tell, How, by a hapless doom, King Agamemnon murdered fell, On his returning home; But upon false Ægisthus well Did fierce avenging come. LVI “For a slaughtered man it is always good A son to leave behind, As he this traitor, in the blood Of his noble father all imbued, Has to cruel death consigned. LVII “So thou, my son, whom I behold A handsome youth, and strong, Give, in thy bearing brave and bold, Matter for future song.” IV. The Cloak. FROM THE ODYSSEY.—Book XIV. 462–533. I Now, Eumæus, give ear and my other friends near; a tale somewhat vaunting I pray you to hear: For you know heady wine will the sagest incline, like a fool out of season, in singing to join; Or unwisely to laugh, or to skip in a dance, and to say what were best left unspoken perchance. II But now 'tis too late, since to talk is my fate, for my tongue to keep back what it means to relate. Oh! were I as young, and as fresh, and as strong, as when, under Troy, brother soldiers among, In ambush as captains were chosen to lie, Odysseus, and King Menelaus, and I. III They called me as third, and I came at the word, and reached the high walls that the citadel gird, Where under the town, we in armor lay down by a brake in the marshes with weeds overgrown; The night came on sharp, bleak the north wind did blow, And frostily cold fell a thick shower of snow. IV Soon with icicles hoar every shield was frozen o'er; but they who their cloaks and their body-clothes wore The night lightly passed, secure from the blast, asleep with their shields o'er their broad shoulders cast; But I, like a fool, had my cloak left behind, Not expecting to shake in so piercing a wind. V My buckler and zone, nothing more had I on; but when the third part of the night-watch was gone, And the stars left the sky, with my elbow then I touched Odys- seus, and spoke to him lying close by— “Noble son of Laertes, Odysseus the wise, I fear that alive I shall never arise. VI “In this night so severe but one doublet I wear, deceived by a god; and my cloak is not here; And no way I see from destruction to flee.” But soon to relieve me a project had he. In combat or council still prompt was his head, And into my ear thus low-whispering he said: VII “Let none of the band this your need understand: keep silent.” Then, resting his head on his hand, “Friends and comrades of mine!” he exclaimed, “as a sign, while I slept has come o'er me a dream all divine: It has warned me how far from the vessels we lie, And that some one should go for fresh force to apply. VIII “And his footsteps should lead, disclosing our need, to King Agamemnon, our chieftain, with speed.” Thoas rose as he spoke, flung off his red cloak, and, running, his way with the message he took; While, wrapt in his garment, I pleasantly lay Till the rise of the golden-throned queen of the day. IX If I now were as young, and as fresh, and as strong, perhaps here in the stables you swineherds among Some a mantle would lend, as the act of a friend, or from the respect that on worth should attend: But small is the honor, I find, that is paid To one who, like me, is so meanly arrayed. X Then, keeper of swine, this answer was thine: “The manner, old man, of thy story is fine, For there was not a word out of place or absurd: thy request shall be granted as soon as preferred. Not a cloak, or aught else, shalt thou want at my hand, That is fit for a beggar in need to demand; XI “Till the night shall pass o'er—in the morning once more, thy rags must thou don, for we here have no store. Among cloaks to go range, or of doublets for change—had we more than one garment a-piece 'twould be strange. But when the dear son of Odysseus comes back, Of cloak or of doublet thou never wilt lack. XII “Those will he bestow, and send thee to go, wherever thy thoughts and thy wishes may flow.” He rose as he said, and laid out a bed—and sheepskins and goats' upon it he spread; And next, stretched by the fireside, Odysseus on these, Lay in cloak large and thick, as he might at his ease. XIII To cover his form, at approach of a storm: or to wrap him in sleep as he there lay down warm— The young men close by in the couch came to lie, but Eumæus refusing to stay from the sty, Was girt to sleep out; while Odysseus was glad That his herd in his absence such vigilance had. XIV His sharp sword around his strong shoulders he wound, and then his thick cloak, wind-defying, he bound; Next, he put on his coat made of skin of she-goat—of a she- goat well fed, and of size worthy note. And he took a sharp spear, with which he might weir the at- tack or of men or of dogs coming near; And to lie with the white-toothed porkers went forth, In a cave of the rock, safely screened from the north. V. The Dog Argus. FROM THE ODYSSEY.—Book XVII. 290–327. I Then as they spake, upraised his head, Pricked up his listening ear, The dog, whom erst Odysseus bred, Old Argus lying near. II He bred him, but his fostering skill To himself had naught availed; For Argus joined not the chase, until The king had to Ilion sailed. III To hunt the wild-goat, hart, and hare, Him once young huntsmen sped; But now he lay an outcast there, Absent his lord, to none a care, Upon a dunghill bed, IV Where store of dung, profusely flung By mules and oxen, lay; Before the gates it was spread along For the hinds to bear away, V As rich manure for the lands they tilled Of their prince beyond the sea; There was Argus stretched, his flesh all filled With the dog-worrying flea. VI But when by the hound his king was known, Wagged was the fawning tail, Backward his close-clapped ears were thrown, And up to his master's side had he flown; But his limbs he felt to fail. VII Odysseus saw, and turned aside To wipe away the tear; From Eumæus he chose his grief to hide, And “Strange, passing strange, is the sight,” he cried, “Of such a dog laid here! VIII “Noble his shape, but I can not tell If his worth with that shape may suit; If a hound he be in the chase to excel, For fleetness of his foot: IX “Or worthless as a household hound, Whom men by their boards will place, For no merit of strength or speed renowned, But admired for shapely grace.” X “He is the dog of one now dead, In a far land away; But if you had seen,” the swineherd said, “This dog in his better day, When Odysseus hence his warriors led To join in the Trojan fray, XI “His strength, his plight, his speed so light, You had with wonder viewed; No beast that once had crossed his sight, In the depths of the darkest wood, 'Scaped him, as, tracking sure and right, He on its trace pursued. XII “But now all o'er in sorrows sore He pines in piteous wise; The king upon some distant shore In death has closed his eyes; And the careless women here no more Tend Argus as he lies. XIII “For slaves who find their former lord No longer holds the sway, No fitting service will afford, Or just obedience pay. XIV “Far-seeing Jove's resistless power Takes half away the soul From him, who of one servile hour Has felt the dire control.” XV This said, the swineherd passed the gate, And entered the dwelling tall, Where proud in state the suitors sate Within the palace hall. XVI And darksome death checked Argus' breath When he saw his master dear; For he died his master's eye beneath, Coming back in the twentieth year. VI. The Funeral of Achilles. FROM THE ODYSSEY.—Book XXIV. 11–97. I The ghosts by Leucas' rock had gone, Over the ocean streams; And they had passed on through the gates of the Sun, And the slumberous land of Dreams. II And onward thence to the verdant mead, Flowering with asphodel, Their course was led, where the tribes of dead, The shadows of mankind, dwell. III Achilles and Patroclus there They found with Nestor's son, And Aias, with whom could as match compare Of the host of the Danai none, For manly form, and gallant air, Save the faultless Peleion. IV Around Achilles pressed the throng Of ghosts in the world below; Soon passed Atrides' shade along, And full was that shade of wo. V About the king came crowding all Who, by a murderous stroke, With him were slain in Ægisthus' hall; And first Achilles spoke. VI “'Twas once, Atrides, our belief, That thunder-joying Jove Ne'er honored other hero-chief With equal share of love. VII “Thy rule a mighty host obeyed, And valiant was the array, When outside Troy was our leaguer laid, For many a woful day. VIII “Yet did the gloom of dismal doom First on thy head alight; From the fate that a birth is marked to come Scaped never living wight. IX “Would that in honor on the ground, Where high thou hadst held command, Thy fallen body had been found, Slain upon Trojan land. X “Where all the men of Achaian blood Their chieftain's tomb might raise— A tomb, in after-times to have stood, For thy son proud mark of praise: But 'twas fate that, by piteous death subdued, Thou shouldst end thy glorious days.” XI “How blest,” then said Atrides' shade, “Thy lot, who fell in war, Godlike Achilles, lowly laid, In Troy, from Argos far. XII “We round thy corse, as slain it lay, The bravest and the best Of either host, the livelong day In slaughterous combat pressed. XIII “Mid clouds of dust, that o'er the dead, In whirlwind fierce arose, On the battle field, all vastly spread, Did thy vast limbs repose; The skill forgot, which whilome sped Thy steed amid the foes. XIV “All day we fought, and no one thought Of holding of the hand; Till a storm to an end the contest brought, Sent by high Jove's command. XV “From the field of fight thy corse we bore, And for the ships we made; We washed away the stains of gore, And thy body fair anointed o'er, Upon its last bed laid. XVI “Hot tears did the eyes of the Danai rain, And they cut their flowing hair; Uprose thy mother from the main, With all the immortal sea-nymph train, At the tidings of despair. XVII “Loud over the sea rose the voice of wail, And the host was filled with dread; And homeward they would, with hasty sail, In their hollow ships have fled, XVIII “Had not a man, to whom was known The wisdom of days of eld, Who in council ever was wisest shown, Nestor, their flight withheld: For he spoke to them thus in sagest tone, And their panic fear dispelled. XIX “‘Argives,’ he said, ‘your steps restrain, Achaia's sons do not flee; His mother is rising from out the main, With all the immortal sea-nymph train, The corse of her son to see.’ XX “The flight was checked—and round thee came The maids of the sea-god old; Sad weeping as they wrapt thy frame In vesture of heavenly fold. XXI “A mournful dirge the Muses nine In strains alternate sung, And from every eye the tearful brine Through the Argive host was wrung; For none could withstand the lay divine Of the Muse's dulcet tongue. XXII “By day and night for ten days' space— For ten days' space and seven, Wept we the men of mortal race, And the deathless gods of heaven. XXIII “And when the eighteenth morning came, To the pile thy corse was borne; And many fat sheep were slain at the flame, And steers of twisted horn. XXIV “With ointment rich upon the pyre, And honey covered o'er, There didst thou burn in rich attire, Such as immortals wore. XXV “And many a hero-chief renowned Rushed forward, foot and horse, The blazing death-pile to surround Where burnt thine honored corse. XXVI “The tumult was loud of that martial crowd, Till the flame had consumed thee quite; And then, when the dawn of morning glowed, We gathered thy bones so white. XXVII “In waterless wine, and ointment fine, When the fire had ceased to burn, We laid those relics prized of thine All in a golden urn. XXVIII “This costly gift thy mother brought; And she said it was bestowed By the god of Wine—a vessel wrought By the Fire-working god. XXIX “And there are laid thy bones so white, Mingled, illustrious chief, With his, thy friend, whose fall in fight Wrought thee such mickle grief. XXX “Those of Antilochus apart Are stored—for, of all the host, After Patroclus slain, thy heart Him loved and honored most. XXXI “And the Argive spearmen, gathering round, Upraised a mighty heap, For thy tomb, a large and lofty mound, Upon a jutting steep. XXXII “Landmark conspicuous there for aye, By Helle's waters wide, For men who may sail on a future day, As for those of the present tide. XXXIII “Thy mother then the gods besought, And they gave what she chose to ask; And many a glorious prize she brought, To be won by manly task. XXXIV “I oft before, when heroes died, Have joined beside their tomb The youths of pride, who there to have tried The feats of strength have come. XXXV “But such store of prize ne'er met my eyes As there that day was seen, Which Thetis brought for thine obsequies, The silver-footed queen. XXXVI “Dear wert thou to the gods; and now, Even in the world beneath, Thy endless glory lies not low, Achilles, with thy death. XXXVII “For ever shall that deathless name Among all mankind live; For ever meed of glorious fame Shall from all the world receive.” VII. The Introduction of Penelope. I Soon as Athené spoke the word, She took the likeness of a bird. And, skyward soaring, fled. The counsels of the heavenly guest Within Telemachus's breast New strength and spirit bred. II His absent father to his thought Was by his wakened memory brought More freshly than of old: But when Athené's flight he saw, A feeling deep of reverend awe His inmost heart controlled. III He knew the stranger was a god; And hastening to his own abode, He joined the suitor train. A far-famed minstrel in the hall Sang to the peers, who listened all In silence to his strain. IV As subject of his lay he chose The mournful story of the woes Borne by the Achaian host, When, under Pallas' vengeful wrath, Homeward returning was their path Bent from the Trojan coast. V The song Icarius' daughter heard, And all thine inmost soul was stirred, Penelope the chaste! Straight did she from her bower repair And passing down the lofty stair, The festal hall she graced. VI Alone she went not—in her train She took with her handmaidens twain; And when the peerless queen Came where the suitors sate, aloof Close by a post that propped the roof, She stood with face unseen. VII A veil concealed her cheeks from view, And by each side a handmaid true In seemly order stood; With tears fast bursting from her eyne, Addressing thus the bard divine, She her discourse pursued: VIII “Phemius! for men's delight thy tongue Can many another flowing song In soothing measure frame; Can tell of many a deed, which done By God or man in days bygone, Bards have consigned to fame. IX “Take one of those, and all around, Silent, will hear the dulcet sound, Drinking the blood-red wine; But cease that melancholy lay That wears my very heart away— A heavy wo is mine! X “How can I check the tide of grief, Remembering still that far-famed chief, Whose fame all Hellas fills?” Answered her son, “Oh! mother mine! Why dost thou blame the bard divine, For singing as he wills? XI “Blame not the poet—blame to Heaven, Which to poor struggling men has given What weight of wo it chose. How can we charge the bard with wrong, If the sad burden of his song Turns on the Danaan woes? XII “Men, ever with delighted ear, The newest song desire to hear. Then firmly to the strain Listen, which tells of perils done: My sire is not the only one Who of the chiefs to Ilion gone Has not returned again. XIII “For many, to that fatal shore Who sailed away, came back no more: Thy business is at home, Thy servant-maidens to command, And ply, with an industrious hand, The distaff, and the loom. XIV “To men, the guiding power must be, At all times, in these halls to me; For here my will is law.” The queen went homeward, as he bade, And felt the words her son had said Inspired her soul with awe. XV Soon did she, with her handmaids twain, Her lofty seated chamber gain. And there, with many a tear, Until Athené came to steep Her weary lids in balmy sleep, Did chaste Penelope be-weep Her absent husband dear. While, seated still at festival, The suitors, in the dusky hall, Revelled with noisy cheer. VIII. The Last Appearance of Penelope. FROM THE ODYSSEY—Book XXIII. 289–343. I A bed of texture soft and fine The nurse and the handmaiden spread; The couch was decked by torchlight shine, And homeward then the old woman sped. While Eurynome, as a chamber-groom, With lamp in hand, to the nuptial room The new-met partners led. II Thither she led them, and withdrew, And left them, as in days of old, Their former dalliance to renew In joyous passion uncontrolled. And the herd of swine, and the herd of kine, With the heir of Ithaca's royal line, Bade the house its peace to hold. III The dance was checked as they desired, The sound of woman's voice repressed; In silence then they all retired Within the darkening halls to rest. And when was done love's dearest rite, Husband and wife with calm delight Their mutual thoughts expressed. IV She told him of the scorn and wrong She long had suffered in her house, From the detested suitor throng, Each wooing her to be his spouse. How, for their feasts, her sheep and kine Were slaughtered, while they quaffed her wine In plentiful carouse. V And he, the noble wanderer, spoke Of many a deed of peril sore— Of men who fell beneath his stroke— Of all the sorrowing tasks he bore. She listened, with delighted ear— Sleep never came her eyelids near, Till all the tale was o'er. VI First told he how the Cicones He had subdued with valiant hand, And how he reached across the seas, The Lotus-eaters' lovely land; The crimes by Polyphemus done, And of the well-earned vengeance won, For slaughter of his band. VII Vengeance for gallant comrades slain, And by the Cyclops made a prey; And how it was his lot to gain The isle where Æolus holds sway; And how the Monarch of the wind Received him with a welcome kind, And would have sent away, VIII Home to his native isle to sail; But vainly against fate he strove, By whom unroused a desperate gale Over the fishy ocean drove, And sent him wandering once again, The toils and dangers of the main With many a groan to prove. IX And how he wandered to the coast Where dwells the distant Læstrygon; How there his ships and friends he lost, Escaping in his bark alone; He spoke of Circe's magic guile, And told the art and deep-skilled wile By the enchantress shown. X Then how to Hades' grisly hall He went to seek the Theban seer, In his swift ship; how there with all The partners of his long career He met; and how his mother mild, Who bore, and reared him from a child, He saw while wandering there. XI And how the dangerous strain he heard, Sung by the Sirens' thrilling tongue; And how with dexterous skill he steered His course the justling rocks among; How he—what none had done before— Unscathed through dread Charybdis bore, And Scylla sailed along. XII And how the oxen of the sun With impious hand his comrades slew; How their devoted bark upon High thundering Jove his lightning threw; How by the bolt of life bereft, Perished his friends, he only left Remaining of the crew. XIII And how, in the Ogygian isle, He visited Calypso fair; And how she sought, with many a wile, To keep him still sojourning there: With fond desire 'twas hers to crave, That he, within her hollow cave, Her nuptial bed should share. XIV Each hospitable art she tried, His heart to win—his hopes to soothe; She promised him, were she his bride Immortal life, and ceaseless youth. But all her promise, all her art, Changed not the temper of his heart, Nor shook his steadfast truth. XV How, after many a year of toil, When on Phæacian land he trod, The king and people of the isle Hailed him with honors of a god; And sent him full of presents fair, Of gold, and brass, and garments rare, Back to his own abode. XVI So closed the tale. Then balmy sleep, The healer of all human woes, Did their relaxing members steep In soft oblivion of repose. IX. The Prophecy of Theoclymenus the Seer. I As Pallas bade, the suitor train Into mad fits of mirth are thrown; You scarce had deemed the jaws they strain— So fierce the laughter—were their own. II The flesh they eat with blood o'erflows, With gushing tears are filled their eyne; And, while each heart impending woes Presaged, uprose the seer divine. III “What is the fate of evil doom Now threatening you, unhappy race? I see that night in thickest gloom Wraps every limb, and form, and face. IV “Outbursts like fire the voice of moan, Drowned are your cheeks with sorrow's flood; And every wall and pillared stone Is soaked and dabbled in your blood. V “Through hall and porch, full many a ghost Crowds toward the mansion of the dead; The sun from out the heavens is lost, And clouds of darkness rushing spread.” VI He ceased, and they with jocund cheer Into glad peals of laughter broke. Eurymachus addressed the seer, And thus in taunting accents spoke: VII “Mad is the new-come guest. 'Tis meet Instant to chase him from our sight; To turn toward haunts of men his feet, Since he mistakes the day for night.” VIII Then thus replied the seer divine: “From thee no guide shall I request, For eyes, and ears, and feet, are mine, And no weak soul inspires my breast. IX “Then from this fated house I go; Swift comes the destined vengeance on; None shall escape the deadly blow Of all the suitors—no, not one. X “Not one of those, who now so long Have in this mansion held control, With words of insult on the tongue, And schemes of baseness in the soul.” XI He went; and as a welcome guest, Piræus' friendly halls he found. The suitors, at the dizzy feast, Each on the other glanced around; And turned the stranger into jest, Telemachus's heart to wound. X. The Story of the Swineherd. FROM THE ODYSSEY.—Book XV. 389–483. I O stranger, if it be thy will My life's whole course to know, Listen in silence seated still, While with my tale the hours I fill, Over the goblet's flow. II The long and tedious night's career Leaves time enough for sleep, Enough a pleasant tale to hear, Which those who lend attentive ear From slumber dull will keep. III Repose not till the hour assigned; Harm by much sleep is done. Let him who feels of drowsier mind, Departing outward, lie reclined, Till the up-dawning sun. IV When, with the porkers of his lord, He from his meal may go; We, seated here beside the board, Eating and drinking, will record Each other's tales of wo. V Sweet is, of perils past and o'er, The story, treasured well— Of all the sufferings that we bore: Our wanderings on a foreign shore— Such as I now shall tell. VI Where turns the sun to set and rise, All to Ortygia's north, Thou may'st have heard that Syria lies, An island of no passing size, But excellent of worth. VII In flocks and kine, in corn and wine, Abundant is its soil; There never famine makes to pine, No maladies to wo consign The dwellers of the soil. VIII When to the years that suit the tomb Its aged sons attain, Then Artemis and Phœbus come, The Archer-gods, to seal their doom, By painless arrows slain. IX Two are its cities, and the land 'Twixt them is parted free; O'er both my sire with regal hand, Ctesius, the godlike, held command; Of Ormenus son was he. X And often the Phœnicians sought This island o'er the main. And their ship-famed men of wily thought Many curious toys in the galleys brought, To barter them there for gain. XI There chanced in my father's house to be A woman of their land; And tall was she, and fair to see, And in works of art right skilfully Practised was she of hand. XII Her beauty made her fall a prey To sailor arts ere long; To bathe when she had ta'en her away, In a seaman's arms in the ship she lay, Won by his glozing tongue. XIII Women are weak: the deftest dame By like deceit may fall. He asked, Who was she? Whence she came? And at once did she as her dwelling name My father's high-roofed hall. XIV “Rich Sidon is my native source, Rich Arybas my sire; As from the fields I bent my course, I by a Taphian pirate-force Was seized, and here, without remorse, Sold for the stated hire.” XV Spoke then the man, in whose embrace She secretly had lain: “Wilt thou with us thy path retrace, To see once more thy natal place, Thy father's halls again? XVI “Them to see? they still survive, Rich in abundant store.” “Be it so; your offer I receive,” She said; “but ye some pledge must give To bring me safe to shore. XVII “Swear this with solemn oath and true, And, sailors, yours am I.” Then, as she bade, did all the crew Take the firm oath in manner due, And duly ratify. XVIII “Be secret now,” the woman cried; “Should any from the ship Henceforth to meet with me betide, In market wide, or at fountain side, Be closed to me his lip; XIX “Lest some one to my master old Should our discourse betray; And he, suspecting from what is told, Should bind me fast in fetters fold, And plot your crew to slay. XX “But keep the secret safely stored, And your purchase of victuals ply: When your full stock is laid on board, Let some one to me, with speedy word, At yonder mansion hie. XXI “And gold with me I shall surely bear, Whatever to hand may come; And with willing mind, as a passage fare, Shall bring you the boy whom as nurse I rear In that rich man's house at home. XXII “He now can run abroad by my side, And the child is sharp and smart; Him then shall I to your vessel guide, And a handsome price he will sure provide, When sold at a foreign mart.” XXIII She said, and then the house she sought: In the isle for a year they staid. Provision in store for their ship they bought, And when the vessel was fully fraught, Their messenger was sped. XXIV Crafty was he whom the sailors sent To take the message sure; To my father's house his way he bent, And a necklace of gold with amber blent He brought with him as a lure. XXV With favoring hand and longing eye, My venerated dame Did with her household maidens try, The trinket, which they fain would buy. Whate'er the price he would name. XXVI He winked at the woman, and went his way; In silence he gave the sign. With my hand in hers, I was led away, Through the porch where many a goblet lay Left where they had met to dine. XXVII My father had gone with every guest, The public court to keep; And she hid three goblets under her vest, And I, with a foolish mind possessed, Followed her to the deep. XXVIII Down sank the sun, and dark was the street, And soon we came to the bay, Where lay the Phœnician galley fleet; They put us on board, and at once we beat Fast over the watery way. XXIX Fair was the wind, vouchsafed by Jove; Six days before the blast, Day and night, in constant course, we drove; The seventh day was doomed to prove That Phœnician woman's last. XXX Her Artemis' fatal arrows slew; And with a noisy force, She fell as plump as sea-coots do, Into the sink, and then they threw To the seals and fish her corse. XXXI And sadly I was left behind; But soon to Ithaca's shore Wafted were we by wave and wind; To Laertes by sale was I consigned;— And now my tale is o'er. XI. The Beaten Beggarman. FROM THE ODYSSEY—Book XVIII. 1– 116. I There came the public beggarman, who all throughout the town Of Ithaca, upon his quest for alms, begged up and down; Huge was his stomach, without cease for meat and drink craved he: No strength, no force his body had, though vast it was to see. II He got as name from parent dame, Arnæus, at his birth, But Irus was the nickname given by gallants in their mirth; For he, where'er they chose to send, their speedy errands bore, And now he thought to drive away Odysseus from his door. III “Depart, old man! and quit the porch,” he cried with insult coarse, “Else quickly by the foot thou shalt be dragged away by force: Dost thou not see, how here on me, their eyes are turned by all, In sign to bid me stay no more, but fling thee from the hall? IV “Tis only shame that holds me back; so get thee up and go! Or ready stand with hostile hand to combat blow for blow.” Odysseus said, as stern he looked with angry glance, “My friend, Nothing of wrong in deed or tongue do I to thee intend. V “I grudge not whatsoe'er is given, how great may be the dole, The threshold is full large for both; be not of envious soul. It seems 'tis thine, as well as mine, a wanderer's life to live, And to the gods alone belongs, a store of wealth to give. VI “But do not dare me to the blow, nor rouse my angry mood;— Old as I am, thy breast and lips might stain my hands with blood. To-morrow free I then from thee the day in peace would spend, For never more to gain these walls thy beaten limbs would bend.” VII “Heavens! how this glutton glibly talks,” the vagrant Irus cried; “Just as an old wife loves to prate, smoked at the chimney side. If I should smite him, from his mouth the shattered teeth were torn, As from the jaws of plundering swine, caught rooting up the corn. VIII “Come, gird thee for the fight, that they our contest may behold. If thou'lt expose to younger arms thy body frail and old.” So in debate engaged they sate upon the threshold stone, Before Odysseus' lofty gate wrangling in angry tone. IX Antinous marked, and with a laugh the suitors he addressed: “Never, I ween, our gates have seen so gay a cause of jest; Some god, intent on sport, has sent this stranger to our hall, And he and Irus mean to fight: so set we on the brawl.” X Gay laughed the guests, and straight arose, on frolic errand bound, About the ragged beggarmen a ring they made around. Antinous cries, “A fitting prize for the combat I require, Paunches of goat you see are here now lying on the fire; XI ‘This dainty food all full of blood, and fat of savory taste, Intended for our evening's meal, there to be cooked we placed. Which ever of these champions bold may chance to win the day, Be he allowed which paunch he will to choose and bear away. And he shall at our board henceforth partake our genial cheer, No other beggarman allowed the table to come near.” XII They all agreed, and then upspoke the chief of many a wile: “Hard is it when ye match with youth age overrun with toil; The belly, counseller of ill, constrains me now to go, Sure to be beaten in the fight with many a heavy blow. XIII “But plight your troth with solemn oath, that none will raise his hand My foe to help with aid unfair, while I before him stand.” They took the covenant it had pleased Odysseus to propose; And his word to plight the sacred might of Telemachus arose. XIV “If,” he exclaimed, “thy spirit bold, and thy courageous heart Should urge thee from the palace gate to force this man to part, Thou needst not fear that any here will strike a fraudful blow; Who thus would dare his hand to rear must fight with many a foe. XV “Upon me falls within these halls the stranger's help to be; Antinous and Eurymachus, both wise, will join with me.” All gave assent, and round his loins his rags Odysseus tied: Then was displayed each shoulder-blade of ample form and wide. XVI His shapely thighs of massive size were all to sight confessed, So were his arms of muscle strong, so was his brawny breast; Athene close at hand each limb to nobler stature swelled; In much amaze did the suitors gaze, when they his form beheld. XVII “Irus un-Irused now,” they said, “will catch his sought-for wo, Judge by the hips which from his rags this old man stripped can show.” And Irus trembled in his soul; but soon the servants came, Girt him by force, and to the fight dragged on his quivering frame. XVIII There as he shook in every limb, Antinous spoke in scorn: “'Twere better, bullying boaster, far, that thou hadst ne'er been born, If thus thou quake and trembling shake, o'ercome with coward fear, Of meeting with this aged man, worn down with toil severe. XIX “I warn thee thus, and shall perform full surely what I say, If, conqueror in the fight, his arm shall chance to win the day, Epirus-ward thou hence shalt sail, in sable bark, consigned To charge of Echetus the king, terror of all mankind. XX “He'll soon deface all manly trace with unrelenting steel, And make thy sliced-off nose and ears for hungry dogs a meal.” He spoke, and with those threatening words filled Irus with fresh dread; And trembling more in every limb, he to the midst was led. XXI Both raised their hands, and then a doubt passed through Odysseus' brain Should he strike him so, that a single blow would lay him with the slain, Or stretch him with a gentler touch prostrate upon the ground; On pondering well, this latter course the wiser one he found. XXII For if his strength was fully shown, he knew that all men's eyes The powerful hero would detect, despite his mean disguise. Irus the king's right shoulder hit; then he with smashing stroke Returned a blow beneath the ear, and every bone was broke. XXIII Burst from his mouth the gushing blood; down to the dust he dashed, With bellowing howl, and in the fall his teeth to pieces crashed. There lay he, kicking on the earth; meanwhile, the suitors proud, Lifting their hands as fit to die, shouted in laughter loud. XXIV Odysseus seized him by the foot, and dragged him through the hall, To porch and gate, and left him laid against the boundary wall. He placed a wand within his hand, and said, “The task is thine, There seated with this staff, to drive away the dogs and swine; XXV “But on the stranger and the poor never again presume To act as lord, else, villain base, thine may be heavier doom.” So saying, o'er his back he flung his cloak, to tatters rent, Then bound it with a twisted rope, and back to his seat he went, XXVI Back to the threshold, while within uprose the laughter gay. And with kind words was hailed the man who conquered in the fray. “May Zeus and all the other gods, O stranger! grant thee still Whate'er to thee most choice may be, whatever suits thy will. XXVII “Thy hand has checked the beggar bold, ne'er to return again To Ithaca, for straight shall he be sped across the main, Epirus-ward, to Echetus, terror of all mankind,” So spoke they, and the king received the omen glad of mind. XII. The First Appearance of Helen FROM THE ODYSSEY.—Book IV. 121–234. I From her perfumed chamber wending, Did the high-born Helen go: Artemis she seemed descending, Lady of the golden bow; Then Adrasta, bent on duty, Placed for her the regal chair; Carpet for the feet of beauty Spread Alcippe soft and fair. II Phylo came the basket holding, Present of Alcandra's hand. Fashioned was its silvery moulding In old Egypt's wealthy land; She, in famous Thebè living, Was of Polybus the spouse, He with soul of generous giving Shared the wealth that stored his house. III Ten gold talents from his coffer, Lavers twain of silver wrought, With two tripods at his offer, Had he to Atrides brought; While his lady came bestowing Gifts to Helen rich of price, Gave a distaff, golden, glowing, Gave this work of rare device. IV Shaped was it in fashion rounded, All of silver but the brim, Where by skilful hand 'twas bounded, With a golden-guarded rim. Now to Helen Phylo bore it, Of its well-spun labor full, And the distaff laid she o'er it, Wrapt in violet-tinted wool. V Throned, then, and thus attended, Helena the king addressed: “Menelaus, Jove-descended, Know'st thou who is here thy guest? Shall I tell thee, as I ponder, What I think, or false or true; Gazing now with eyes of wonder On the stranger whom I view? VI “Shape of male or female creature, Like to bold Odysseus' son; Young Telemachus in feature, As this youth I seen have none. From the boy his sire departed. And to Ilion's coast he came When to valiant war ye started All for me—a thing of shame.” VII And Atrides spake, replying, “Lady, so I think as thou, Such the glance from eyeball flying, Such his hands, his feet, his brow; Such the locks his forehead gracing; And I marked how, as I told Of Odysseus' deeds retracing, Down his cheek the tear-drop rolled. VIII “While he wiped the current straying With his robe of purple hue.” Nestor's son then answered, saying— “What thou speakest, king, is true. He who at thy board is sitting Is of wise Odysseus sprung; Modest thoughts, his age befitting, Hitherto have stilled his tongue. IX “To address thee could he venture, While thy winning accents flowed, In our ravished ears to enter, As if uttered by a god! At Gerenian Nestor's sending Comes beneath my guidance he, In the hope thy well intending To his guest of help may be. X Many a son feels sorrow try him While his sire is far away, And no faithful comrade by him, In his danger prop or stay. So, my friend, now vainly sighing, O'er his father absent long, Finds no hand, on which relying, He may meet attempted wrong.” XI Kindly Menelaus spake him, Praised his sire in grateful strain, Told his whilome hope to take him As a partner in his reign; All were softened at his telling Of the days now past and gone; Wept Telemachus, wept Helen, Fell the tears from Nestor's son. XII Gushing came they for his brother, Slain by Dawn-born Memnon's sword; But his grief he strove to smother, As unfit for festal board. Ceased the tears for wo and slaughter, And again began the feast; Bore Asphalion round the water, Tendered to each noble guest.] XIII Then to banish gloomy thinking, Helen on gay fancy bent, In the wine her friends were drinking, Flung a famed medicament: Grief-dispelling, wrath-restraining, Sweet oblivion of all wo; He the bowl thus tempered draining Never felt a tear to flow. XIV Not if she whose bosom bore him Or his sire in death were laid; Were his brother slain before him, Or his son with gory blade. In such drugs was Helen knowing; Egypt had supplied her skill, Where these potent herbs are growing, Some for good, and some for ill. XIII. The Genealogy of Glaucus. FROM THE ILIAD.—Book VI. 145–211. I Why do you ask, bold Tydeus' son, Why do you ask, what race am I? As forest-leaves have come and gone, So does the race of mankind hie: The wind outblows, and straightway strows The scattered leaves upon the ground; But soon the wood blooms green in bud, When again the spring-tide hours come round. II Such, and no more, the race of man; One flowers, and another fades apace. But if you truly wish to scan How runs the lineage of our race, What many know I straight will show: Within a nook of Argos land, The land which breeds such gallant steeds, Doth Ephyra's ancient city stand. III And there dwelt Sisyphus, the son Of Œolus, the tempest lord And through all the earth a wilier one Could not the sons of men afford. To Glaucus his heir, did his lady bear The gallant youth, Bellerophon, To whom high Heaven had fine form given, And strength in kindly valor shown. IV But Prœtus, in his evil soul, Felt toward him foul and felon thought (And under King Prœtus' stern control Had Jove the men of Argos brought), His queenly dame of lofty name Had felt sharp passion's fiercest sting, And to his breast, with love unblest, Desired in stolen joy to cling. V But wise, and all averse to wrong, He would not with her wish comply. Then spoke she with a traitorous tongue Her husband in a ready lie: “Do slaughter on Bellerophón, Or let thyself, O Prœtus! die, Because he strove with shameless love Within my arms by force to lie.” VI She spoke: and when the king had heard, All through his soul fierce anger flew; To slay his youthful guest he feared. Much scrupling such a deed to do, By his command to Lycian land The unsuspecting youth was sent. But many a mark of import dark He bore off with him as he went. VII In tablets of the closest fold, Prœtus' life-killing mandates lay— There was his lady's father told Bellerophón at once to slay. But heavenly led to Lycia sped, My favored grandsire on his way; And when he came to Xanthus' stream, Much honor did its monarch pay. VIII Nine days they held the constant feast, Nine oxen for the board they slew; When on the tenth day in the East, Blushed forth the dawn of rosy hue, The king addressed his honored guest, And spoke his wish that should be shown With what intent there had been sent To Lycian land Bellerophón. IX Now when the message met his eye— And Prœtus' felt intent he knew— He sent him, and one doomed to die, The dire Chimæra to subdue. From heavenly seed, not human breed, That yet unconquered monster came. Dreadful, I ween, her throat was seen Fierce breathing forth the fiery flame. X In head a lion, in the tail A dragon, and a goat in loin; Yet did his valor there prevail, Upheld by portents all divine. And next his glaive the Solymi brave Did with their blood in battle wet: Oft did he say such desperate fray As theirs in fight he never met. XI Thirdly, he smote with mortal scar The Amazons who warred on man; And back returning from that war 'Gainst him a plot the Lycians plan. Through Lycia wide, the flower and pride Of all her warriors have they ta'en, And with them laid an ambuscade; But not a man returned again. XII They perished by his hand subdued; And then, as Lycia's king knew well That he was born of godlike blood, He kept him in the land to dwell. His daughter as bride he gave, and, beside, Shared with him half his reign; And of land which there is most rich and rare Was chosen as his domain. XIII Fit land the clustering vine to raise, Fit land to ply the spade; But even on him in latter days The wrath of Heaven was laid. And all alone he wandered on The Aleian plain apart; From human path, in wo or wrath, Devouring his own heart. XIV Two sons, one daughter, to his love Were by his lady given; Laodamia, lofty Jove, Whose guidance rules o'er Heaven, Clasped in his arms, and of her charms Is brave Sarpedon sprung; But Artemis' bow soon laid her low, By fiery anger stung. XV Isander against the Solymi In glorious battle stood; And Ares doomed him there to die, The sateless god of blood. The second son as sire I own, Hippolochus he hight; And from Lycia far, to the field of war, Hath he sent me here to fight. XVI And much was the counsel my father gave At Troy to bear me well: Ever to show myself bold and brave, And all others to excel; And not to disgrace the ancient race, Which still mid the best did shine Or in Lycia wide, or by Ephyra-side. Such, Diomede, is my line. XIV. The Arming of Achilles. FROM THE ILIAD.—Book XIX. 357 to the end. I As snow-flakes are driven through the wintry heaven, When Boreas fiercely blows, So thick and so fast, helms beaming bright, And bossy shields, and corslets tight, And ash-spears ready for the fight, Out from the ships arose. II And their brilliant beam, in dazzling stream, Skyward ascending soared, And the shine which their armor shed around Lit with a laugh the kindling ground, While their trampling feet raised a thunder sound, As they closed about their lord. III His teeth he gnashed, and his eyeballs flashed Like the flame of a burning brand; His soul with grief and rage was fraught; And wrapping his heart in vengeful thought, He harnessed himself in the armor wrought And given by Hephæstos' hand. IV First, with the grasp of silver clasp, His greaves did he buckle on; Then he armed his breast with a bright cuirass, Flung round his shoulders his sword of brass, Uplifted his shield, a ponderous mass, Like the moon from afar it shone. V As when sailors, who keep on the storm-vexed deep Their way with unwilling oar, The blaze of a distant fire espy From some lonely fold in the mountains high, When forced by the blast their course they ply, Driven away from their native shore; VI So to heaven shot the light from the buckler bright That guarded Achilles' breast. Next lifted he up to sheath his head His helmet of strength fit for combat dread, Around like a star was its lustre shed Beneath the horse-hair crest. VII And the golden thread so thickly spread By Hephæstos the cone around, Waved in the air, as the chief essayed If close to his shape were the armor laid, If his shapely limbs in free motion played, Within its harness bound. VIII With the lightsome spring of a bird's fleet wing Buoyant they bore him on; And next from the spear-case he went to take His father's spear, huge, massy, of make Which no other hand in the host could shake Save his good right hand alone. IX [An ash-tree spear for his father dear Hewed down by Chiron's stroke From Pelion's summits where waves the wood, He sent it to drip in warriors' blood.] Meanwhile the squires by the horses stood As they set them beneath the yoke. X They fasten the trace, and they firmly place In the bending jaws the bit; Back to the car the reins are thrown, And seizing the whip to his hand well known, Sprung to his seat Automed?n, Where long he had loved to sit. XI And behind that seat in arms complete, Stood Achilles girt for war; He glowed like the sun in his noon-day gyre, And his chiding voice sounded fierce and dire, As thus to the chargers of his sire He shouted from the car. XII “My bright bay horse—my fleet of course, Podargé's far-famed brood,— Yours be it your master back to bear From the battle-field now with surer care, Leave me not as you left Patroclus there, All weltering in his blood.” XIII Then out upspoke from beneath the yoke His dapple-foot steed of bay, Low stooped his head, and the yoke around His mane encircling swept over the ground, For Heré had given him vocal sound Achilles' fate to say. XIV “Once yet again from the battle-plain, Safe back we bear thee home. But thy hour of death is hastening nigh, All blameless are we, yet thou must die, Slain by the hand of a godhead high, Such is Fate's relentless doom. XV “By no lack of speed, no sloth of steed, Patroclus' arms were lost; It was he, most glorious god of light, The son of fair Leto, of tresses bright, Who slew him amid the foremost fight, And gave Hector the fame to boast. XVI “By our flight as fast as Zephyrus' blast Was thy chariot whirled along, Yet here it is fated thy bones be laid, By a god's strong power and a mortal's blade!” Mute was the horse when these words were said, For the Furies chained his tongue. XVII Then with angry word the swift-foot lord, Thus spoke his prophetic horse:— “Why, Xanthus, in boding tone, Hast thou my coming death fore-shown? Needless to tell what so well is known, That here I lay my corse. XVIII “It is fixed by Fate that I end my date From my father's land afar: But still, ere my day of life runs out, No war shall the Trojans lack or rout.” So said he; and, with a thundering shout, Drove his steeds to the thickest war. XV. The Genealogy of Aeneas. FROM THE ILIAD.—Book III. 200–259. I Idle the thoughts, my soul to daunt, Like a weak boy's with angry tongue; I could return, with scoffing taunt, Words of reviling, wrath, and wrong. I know thy line, and thou knowest mine, What need it that the tale be told? Spreads over the earth our lofty birth In legends of days of old. II The face of my parents thou ne'er hast viewed. To my eyes thine were never shown, But that thou art of King Peleus' blood To all mankind is known; And of Thetis the fair, with flowing hair, Who dwells 'neath the ocean wave. To Anchises' arms, me, the Queen of Charms, Pledge of love, Aphrodite gave. III One pair to-day for offspring slain In loud lament must weep; No longer shall this childish strain Our spears from the conflict keep. But if I must tell, what to most men well Is known, my lineage proud, In days long since gone, was Dardanus, son Of Zeus, who compels the cloud. IV And he built Dardania, for not as yet On the plain sacred Ilion stood; But their dwellings at foot of Ida they set With many a fountain dewed. Next the heir of his race filled his lordly place, Erichthonius, richest of men, For of thousands three brood-mares had he, Feeding upon the fen. V Loose in the marsh were they turned to feed; And, as Boreas whirled along, He was seized with desire, while in flowery mead They frolicked amid their young. With passion warm, in a dark steed's form, He veiled his godlike mould; And from his embrace, a wondrous race Of twelve she-colts was foaled. VI Over waving corn was their fleet career, On its topmost beard it were sped; So rapid and light their touch, no ear Would bend beneath their tread. If their bounding track coursed over the back Of ocean spreading wide; On the unscattered spray of the waters gray, They skimmed along the tide. VII And from Tros, his son, who the Troës swayed After his sire as king, Did Ilus, Assaracus, Ganymede, Three gallant princes, spring. And in grace the last all men surpassed, So far that the admiring gods To Heaven caught him up to bear Jove's cup, And dwell in their blest abodes. VIII To the son of Ilus Laomedon Were the bridegroom of the Morn, Tithonus, and Priam, who fills the throne, Lampus and Clytius born; And as sturdy a branch, Hicetaon stanch, As Ares ever had grown. Through Assaracus we join this princely tree, My grandsire was his son. IX Capys, Anchises' sire; he mine. Such is my lineage high. As Hector is head of Priam's line, So of my father's, I. But deem not that worth will follow birth, They come not at mortal call; But in varying degrees, as Zeus may please, They are given by the Lord of all. X But let us no more, like silly boys, Wrangle here in idle strain, While all around the fight's fierce noise Is sounding over the plain. For both and each of slanderous speech Might choose a ponderous load; Far more in weight, than a galley's freight, By five-score rowers rowed. XI The tongue is a weapon nimble to wield, For which ample task is found, And of words is a wide and open field, All spreading round and round. Whatever is said, soon back is sped, So why should we jarring here, Like women in rage, contentious wage This poor and wordy war? XII Women hurrying on to the public path, Careless of false or true, At each other rail, as swelling wrath Inspires each scolding shrew. By your right arm strong—not your angry tongue— Must I from the field be chased; No longer I stay, without more delay Let our spears of the battle taste. XVI. Nestor's First Essay in Arms. WITH AN INTRODUCTION AND NOTES BY THE TEMPLAR. FROM THE ILIAD—Book XI. 670–761. I Oh! was I as erst in my youthful day, In vigor and strength the same, When we and the Eleans about a prey Of cattle to combat came; When by my hand Itymones fell To the rescue rushing on; (Of Hypirochus who was wont to dwell In Elis, gallant son.) II In the foremost line as he guarded his kine, I stretched him amid the dead; While with fear and amaze did the wild troops gaze Whom he from his farm-lands led Fifty flocks of goats, as many sheep, And fifty drove of swine; Fifty lowing herds at one night's sweep I drove from the plain as mine. III And thrice fifty mares of yellow main, And with them many a foal, And we drove them to Neleus who held his reign In those olden times o'er the Pylian plain, And rejoiced was he in his soul That to me, so young in my first essay, Should so rich a booty fall; And by heralds at dawn of the breaking day, It was proclaimed to all. IV To whom debt was due all Elis through Should meet in the spoils to share; And together the Pylian chieftains drew, And made a division fair; For many a score of ancient date Was to poor Pylos owed, For we were reduced to low estate By the strength of a demigod. V For Hercules came in years gone by, And by him were our best men slain; Twelve gallant sons had Neleus, and I Did then the last remain; The Epeians, therefore, thought they might dare In their haughty meanness strong; To a people so weak they refused to spare Insults of deed, or tongue. VI A lowing herd and a fleecy flock, In number of hundreds three, As his share with the shepherds old Neleus took, For the heaviest claim had he. Four horses famed for glories won When contending for the prize, As for a tripod they went to run, Were seized in a shameful wise. VII King Augias stopped them travelling on, And back the driver came, His race not run, his coursers gone, With anger filled and shame. Large, therefore, the share might my father choose, To the people he gave the rest, That none might his fairness in dolling accuse, To divide as it pleased him best. VIII And now our various labors done, Due sacrificial cheer We offered the gods outside the town, Free from the pressing fear; But on the third morn, of foot and horse A mighty gathering came; The Molians armed them with the force, Though but boys unknown to fame. IX A distant town Thryoessa stands Where Alpheus' waters sweep At the edge remote of Pylos' sands, Perched on the rocky steep. This far-off town they sought to gain, And to use it at their need; But when they had traversed all the plain Athene came with speed X By night; and the Pylians to arms she bid, And they answered with delight; But my steeds of war old Neleus hid, To keep me from the fight. He said I knew not the works of war, And yet to the field I sped, Where I fought, though on foot, the horsemen near, By Athene's orders led. XI Close by Arene the Minyas flows, And falls into the sea, Where the Pylian horsemen, till morning rose, Awaited our infantry. Then full of force our armor shine, By Alpheus' banks we stood, And we sacrificed there to the powers divine, And first to the Olympian God. XII To Alpheus a steer—to Posidon a steer, And a heifer all unbroke To Pallas—and then our festal cheer Throughout the ranks we took. And the livelong night in our arms we lay, Close by the rushing tide, While to Pylos the Epeians made their way, Camping its walls beside. XIII And soon as morning's dawn was seen, Scattering its light around, Praying to Jove, and Wisdom's Queen, We for the fight were bound; When we fairly joined us in the fray, By me was the first man slain; No horses longer I needed that day, And my father's scheme was vain. XIV Brave Moleus, whom I made to bleed, Had chosen as a bride King Augias' daughter, fair Agamede, By whom the virtues of plant and weed, Wherever grown, were tried. And I slew him there with my brazen spear, And as in the dust he rolled, In his chariot I drove in hot career To the foremost warriors bold. XV And hither and thither the Epeians fled, When they saw that warrior fall, Their horse to the fight who had always led, And was foremost in valor's call. But on I rushed, like a darksome blast, And from fifty chariots soon, To bite the dust two riders were cast, By my right arm alone. XVI And the Molian twins I there had slain But for the pitchy cloud In which their father, who rules the main, Did them from danger shroud. Then Jove assisting across the field, We made the Epeians fly, The men we slay, and their corses yield Of armor a rich supply. XVII Till we came to Buprasium, rich in wheat, Our horse rode conquering still, Under Olenia's rocky retreat And Alicium's distant hill. And there their last man low I laid; And much honor we lavished free, First 'mong the gods to Jove they paid, 'Mong mankind first to me.</field>

D.The verse has been extracted from prose text. “TO HELEN R. “Within the shade of yonder grove, Fair Helen reared her woodbine bower, And fondly hoped unscared by Love Would flit away each tranquil hour; Her moments flew unchased by care, And calm she dwelt in peace and pleasure, While still that Love could not stray there, Was Helen's bosom's cherished treasure. “One day the god, within the wood, Had roved, with Nature's sweets enchanted, To where fair Helen's bower stood, By fancy sketched, and beauty planted. He gazed entranced, as light the latch He slily raised to beg admission, Waited her dark blue glance to catch, Then lowly proffered his petition. “‘A feeble boy, alas! am I, No parents' tender care is mine, I've missed the wood-path here hard by, I've lost my home, and strayed to thine; I'm weary, too, think on my lot, Without thine aid, alas! I'll perish; Then, oh! receive me in thy cot, And a forlorn poor baby cherish.’ “She heard his prayer, she wept, she smiled, Then kindly bade the boy good morrow; And, oh! the urchin soon beguiled The heart that strove to soothe his sorrow. While, simple maid! too late she found, Go where she may, there Love would wander; And not a spot, though fairy ground, Could keep her soul and his asunder.” “THE MOCKINGS OF THE SOLDIERS. “FROM ST. MATTHEW. “‘Plant a crown upon his head, Royal robe around him spread; See that his imperial hand Grasps, as fit, the sceptral wand: Then before him bending low, As becomes his subjects, bow; Fenced within our armed ring, Hail him, hail him, as our King!’ “Platted was of thorns the crown, Trooper's cloak was royal gown; If his passive hand, indeed, Grasped a sceptre, 't was a reed; He was bound to feel and hear Deeds of shame, and words of jeer; For he whom king in jest they call Was a doomed captive scoffed by all. “But the brightest crown of gold, Or the robe of rarest fold, Or the sceptre which the mine Of Golconda makes to shine, Or the lowliest homage given By all mankind under heaven, Were prized by him no more than scorn, Sceptre of reed, or crown of thorn. “Of the stars his crown is made, In the sun he is arrayed, He the lightning of the spheres As a flaming sceptre bears: Bend in rapture before him Ranks of glowing seraphim; And we, who spurned him, trembling stay The judgment of his coming day.” “I GIVE MY SOLDIER-BOY A BLADE. “I give my soldier-boy a blade, In fair Damascus fashioned well; Who first the glittering falchion swayed, Who first beneath its fury fell, I know not, but I hope to know That for no mean or hireling trade, To guard no feeling base or low, I give my soldier-boy a blade. “Cool, calm, and clear, the lucid flood In which its tempering work was done, As calm, as clear, as cool of mood, Be thou whene'er it sees the sun; For country's claim, at honor's call, For outraged friend, insulted maid, At mercy's voice to bid it fall, I give my soldier-boy a blade. “The eye which marked its peerless edge, The hand that weighed its balanced poise, Anvil and pincers, forge, and wedge, Are gone with all their flame and noise— And still the gleaming sword remains; So, when in dust I low am laid, Remember by those heart-felt strains, I gave my soldier-boy a blade.” “TO MY DAUGHTERS. “O my darling little daughters— O, my daughters loved so well— Who by Brighton's breezy waters For a time have gone to dwell. Here I come with spirit yearning With your sight my eyes to cheer, When this sunny day returning, Brings my forty-second year. “Knit to me in love and duty, Have you been, sweet pets of mine, Long in health, and joy, and beauty May it be your lot to shine: And at last, when God commanding, I shall leave you good and kind “May I leave my ‘Nan’ and ‘Pigeon,’ Mild of faith, of purpose true— Full of faith and meek religion— With many joys and sorrows few. Now I part, with fond caressing, Part you now, my daughters dear— Take, then, take a father's blessing, In his forty-second year.” [“Here, early to bed, lies kind William Maginn] “Walton-on-Thames, Aug. 1842. “Here, early to bed, lies kind William Maginn, Who, with genius, wit, learning, Life's trophies to win, Had neither great Lord nor rich cit of his kin, Nor discretion to set himself up as to tin; So, his portion soon spent (like the poor heir of Lynn), He turned author, ere yet there was beard on his chin— And, whoever was out, or whoever was in, For your Tories his fine Irish brains he would spin, Who received prose and rhyme with a promising grin— ‘Go ahead, you queer fish, and more power to your fin!’ But to save from starvation stirred never a pin. Light for long was his heart, though his breeches were thin, Else his acting, for certain, was equal to Quinn; But at last he was beat, and sought help of the bin (All the same to the Doctor, from claret to gin), Which led swiftly to jail, with consumption therein. It was much, when the bones rattled loose in the skin, He got leave to die here, out of Babylon's din. Barring drink and the girls, I ne'er heard of a sin— Many worse, better few, than bright, broken Maginn.” FRASERIAN PAPERS.The verse has been extracted from prose text. THE ELECTION OF EDITOR. [“Ladies and Gentlemen—It was a strange] “Ladies and Gentlemen—It was a strange Sensation that came o'er me, when at first, From the broad sunshine, I stepped in and saw The narrowing line of daylight that came running In after me shut by the door outside. All then around was dusky twilight dim, Made out of shadows most fantastical, The unsubstantial progeny of light Shining on singularities of art. There stood around, all in a circ'lar row, Seven colossal statues—each a king Upon a rich Corinthian capital. Sceptres were in their hands, and on their heads Were golden crowns, in shape similar To that small bonnet which adorned of yore My dexter temple, when, the live-long day, I delved the classics in that blue-coat school, Fast by famed Newgate's jail; and one there was As Nestor, or as Priam king of Troy, Venerable—a marble brought from Athens, Which, though oblivion hung upon his nose, Wore the grave aspect of antiquity. ‘These,’ said our host, the modest Mister Soane, ‘Are planets, and they rule the fates of men.’ ‘Are they not rather,’ was my fond reply, Thrilling with wonderment ineffable, ‘The seven sciences—stupendous spirits, That mock the pride of man, and people space With life and mystical predominance?’ And, full of that sublime conception, out I throbbing came upon this window-sill, Where I beheld you multitudinous, A Lake of Physiognomies, whose waves Were human faces—and whose murmurings— Discordant din of discontented tongues, Shattered the crystal calmness of the air.— But I had then the sense of sweetest influences, [To the Ladies. The intelligible forms of ancient poets, The fair humanities of old religion, The power, the beauty, and the majesty, That have their haunts in dale or piny mountain, Or forest by low stream or pebbly spring, Or such green bogs as Irishmen afar, In Australasia or Cabotia lone, Dream are in Erin's isle. Then I bethought Wherefore this wise and beauteous multitude Were here assembled, from all quarters come, Like the rich argosies and merchantmen That swing at anchor in the pool or stream Below famed London bridge—and thence inspired, I call upon you to give suffrage. Now, Who shall be Editor, and, like the stars Immortal burning in their glorious spheres, Make you all stars, dispensing destiny? For such shall be the issues of this day, If you, in your intelligence serene, Make a seraphic choice.” Song. [Fill up your bumpers, lads, brimmers all round!] Fill up your bumpers, lads, brimmers all round! This world's a queer world, you may think; And, faith, so it is, as we've most of us found, And that's why I wish you to drink. D'ye wait for a toast?—then I'll give you “the King!” And, while we've such cause to caress him, With hearts just as full as our goblets, we'll sing, Here's “William the Fourth, God bless him!” God bless him! Here's “William the Fourth, God bless him!” Again, my lads, fill to the health of a king, Who roughed it right bravely when young; And, when but small profit her service could bring, To the pure cause of Liberty clung! 'Tis the king, who's now called by his nation—but hold!— I see by your eyes that you guess him— Then drink to a name with the proudest enrolled— Here's “Philip of France, God bless him!” God bless him! Here's “Philip of France, God bless him!” Oh, proud was the day, when the spirit of France In the might of its energy rose; And, teaching a new sort of national dance, Astonished old tyranny's toes! And such be the lesson by nations still taught, When Despots shall dare to oppress 'em. Then fill up once more, lads, and drink as ye ought, “The People of France, God bless 'em!” God bless 'em! “The People of France, God bless 'em!” O'Doherty sings his translation. Drink and drown your politics! Curse the trash of Colburn! D?n “New Monthly's” greasy wicks, Dimly as the whole burn! Banished from our jovial board Be the lack-a-daisy horde! Banished be the leaden lore, Worse than edgeless razor! Heavy fools! who fain would soar, Go and study Fraser! Still Regina's rule be mine— Wit and Wisdom's fount is wine! Mr. Jesse's Song. From that pure author, Nature, came One article without a heading; You stare—but I'll just prove that same— She manufactured Cyrus Redding! Witless Cyrus, Born to tire us, Cyrus, Cyrus, Cyrus Redding! And, knowing what he'd have to do, She gave his roof an inside leading; And said—“Wit's shaft shall ne'er pierce through The thick lined top of Cyrus Redding. Silly Cyrus, Born to tire us, Cyrus, Cyrus, Cyrus Redding!” Then Cyrus grew a lanky lad, Few notions in his brains imbedding; “Much thinking,” thought he, “drives men mad.” Well, there you're safe, sweet Cyrus Redding. Lanky Cyrus, Born to tire us, Cyrus, Cyrus, Cyrus Redding! “But though not born, it seems, to think, My stomach can 't want meat and breading; Nor must my throttle thirst for drink— I'll be a scribe,” said Cyrus Redding. Scribbling Cyrus, Born to tire us, Cyrus, Cyrus, Cyrus Redding! So he began to scribble trash, Nor gods, nor men, nor columns dreading; Till something whispered—“Cut and slash, And fawn and slaver, Cyrus Redding.” Slav'ring Cyrus, Born to tire us, Cyrus, Cyrus, Cyrus Redding! He heard the voice and joined Reviewers, Their tea-cup twaddle widely spreading, With minds as bright as Barclay's brewers' And hearts like that of Cyrus Redding. Twaddling Cyrus, Born to tire us, Cyrus, Cyrus, Cyrus Redding! Until he gained King Campbell's grace We scorn to track his tortuous threading— Judge they who 've looked upon his face, 'Twixt Jerry Sneak and Cyrus Redding. Sneaking Cyrus, Born to tire us, Cyrus, Cyrus, Cyrus Redding! And now he reigns, the L. U.'s Sec., The bottle's blood profusely shedding, Oh, that a rope but held the neck And we the heels of Cyrus Redding! That thought—Cyrus, Shall inspire us! Cyrus, Cyrus, Cyrus Redding! And be d?d to him! (Multifarious applause—and shortly after a most outrageous roar of laughter.) [Whisky mixed up with water] Whisky mixed up with water, Quenching his thirst, With three parts of the first, Moistened off with a part of the latter: Lay of the Whipper-in. You all knew Bill Sligo, the Whipper-in, well— 'Mong a thousand his crack you'd be certain to tell; On the night of division his voice would be hard, From the North to the South of yon Old Palace Yard. “Hark—hark!—in and in—hither come to the vote!” And so old Bill Sligo kept straining his throat. When the moment appeared that the game was at bay, And the thing should be settled at once, “aye or nay,” Old Bill shewed his face, dashed the thong all around— From each lurking spot he sure brought up his hound. “Yoicks, Bathurst—Dundas, halloo!—Squeakum, ho! Wynn— Hark to Old Billy Sligo, who's whipping you in. Ho! whelps out of Ireland—Ho, hounds North of Tweed! High, close to the cover—or else no more feed. Hollo, Croker—Ho! Murr—Mangy Georgebob, Twiss, haw! Bloody Jem, Scruffy Franky, whelp Tommy Macaw; Keep up, keep ye up, steady there, Sturdy Bourne!” Songs Old Bill Sligo to each in his turn. When at last shall ill luck put him out of his sate, O, think of him, lads, on the night of Debate; Think how well he his whip, my dear bastes, had applied, How so long he had kept you from running all wide; And his place in the writ as the Speaker shall fill, Give three hearty view hollows for poor Sligo Bill. Song. [Oh! 'tis sweet to think that ratting will thrive] Oh! 'tis sweet to think that ratting will thrive, And that we may leave old friends in the lurch; That the Duke to his brother-apostates will give High station and rank in our Protestant church! Dean Philpotts, perchance, had been always a dean, Had he stuck by his High Church and old Tory pals; So a traitor he turned, and a rat he has been, In the hope of obtaining the pontificals. Then, ho to apostates!—'tis pleasant to think That your only wise men are apostates and knaves; Though their names in posterity's nostrils should stink, Will a trifle like this disturb them in their graves? [In Liverpool's good easy times] Tune—The Vicar of Bray. In Liverpool's good easy times, When church and king no harm meant, I stuck to old Shute Barrington, And so I got preferment. By Scarlett's help, the radicals O' the Durham press I stampt on, And on the hustings, day-by-day, I bearded yellow Lambton. And this is law I shall maintain, And sure it is no vain hope, That if I stick by powers that be, I'll be the vicar o' Stanhope. I wrote a letter very fine, Frank Jeffrey all defying; I knew the fellow would not fight, And so I called him lying. I published, too, a book so smart, That all the Papists flouted; Which sweet Jack Copley got by heart, And in the Commons spouted. And, &amp;c. But under good Duke Wellington The times are altered fairly; His Grace has eaten all his words— Belied himself most rarely. And so Old Nick take Barrington, To whom I owed my station; Ascendancy the de'il may sweep Huzza for 'mancipation! And, &amp;c. O'Connell is a pretty youth— Jack Doyle a lively scholar— Old Eldon's creed, since lost his place, I prize not half a dollar. Gulph down—gulph down, old thoughts, old oaths, Curse on each ancient bias; And if 'twould get a bishoprick, God save our Lord Pope Pius! And, &amp;c. The Wind and the Wave. We go wherever the wind and the wave May chance in their pleasure to bear us; They may waft us to home, they may find us a grave— From all that we loved they may tear us: But where'er the winds blow, and where'er the waves flow, We cheerily, merrily, sing as we go, The wind and the wave for ever! Alike we 're ready to frolic or fight, For pleasure no boys are more ready— And we out with our guns if the foe come in sight, Then “fire away, Lads, and stand steady!” And spite of the number and force of the foe, We pour in our shot, and we sing as we go, The wave of Old England for ever! When back returned we are safe on the shore, Then smack go the lips of the lasses; And the number of blessings this earth has in store We count by the number of glasses— Then sail off again, and where'er the winds blow, We cheerily, merrily, sing as we go, The wind and the wave for ever! THE SHERIDAN FAMILY. “Next follows Sheridan—a doubtful name, As yet unsettled in the ranks of fame. This, fondly lavish in his praises grown, Gives him all merit—this allows him none. Between them both, we'll steer the middle course, Nor, loving praise, rob judgment of her force. Just his conceptions, natural and great: His feelings strong, his words enforced with weight, Was sheep-faced Quin himself to hear him speak, Envy would drive the color from his cheek: But step-dame Nature, niggard of her grace, Denied the social powers of voice and face; Fixed in one frame of features, glare of eye, Passions, like chaos, in confusion lie: In vain the wonders of his skill are tried To form destruction Nature hath denied. His voice no touch of harmony admits, Irregularly deep and shrill by fits: The two extremes appear like man and wife, Coupled together for the sake of strife. His actions always strong, but sometimes such That candor must declare he acts too much. Why must impatience fall three paces back? Why paces three return to the attack? Why is the right leg, too, forbid to stir, Unless in motion semicircular? Why must the hero with the nailer vie, And hurl the close clenched fist on nose or eye? In royal John with Philip angry grown, I thought he would have knocked poor Davies down. Inhuman tyrant! was it not a shame To fight a king so harmless and so tame? But, spite of all defects, his glories rise; And art, by judgment formed, with nature vies. Behold him sound the depth of Hubert's soul, Whilst in his own contending passions roll. View the whole scene—with critic judgment scan, And then deny his merit if you can. Where he falls short, 't is Nature's fault alone; When he succeeds the merit's all his own.” “He stands before her now; and who is he Into whose outspread arms confidingly She flings her fairy self? Unlike the forms That woo and win a woman's love—the storms Of deep contending passions are not seen Darkening the features where they once have been, Nor the bright workings of a generous soul, Of feelings half concealed, explain the whole. But there is something words can not express— A gloomy, deep, and quiet fixedness; A recklessness of all the blows of fate— A brow untouched by love, undimmed by hate— As if, in all its stores of crime and care, Earth held no suffering now for him to bear. Yes; all is passionless: the hollow cheek Those pale thin lips shall never wreathe with smiles; E'en now, 'mid joy, unmoved and sad they speak In spite of all his Linda's winning wiles. Yet can we read, what all the rest denies, That he hath feelings of a mortal birth, In the wild sorrow of those dark bright eyes, Bent on that form—his one dear link to earth. He loves, and he is loved! then what avail The scornful words which seek to brand with shame?” “A light and lovely thing, Fair as the opening flower of early spring. The deep rose crimsoned in her laughing cheek, And her eyes seemed without the tongue to speak; Those dark-blue glorious orbs!—oh! summer skies Were nothing to the heaven of her eyes. And then she had a witching art To wile all sadness from the heart; Wild as the half-tamed gazelle, She bounded over hill and dell, Breaking on you when alone With her sweet and silvery tone, Dancing to her gentle lute With her light and fairy foot; Or to our lone meeting-place Stealing slow with gentle pace, To hide among the feathery fern; And while waiting her return, I wandered up and down for hours— She started from amid the flowers, Wild, and fresh, and bright as they, To wing again her sportive way.” “My early and my only love, why silent dost thou lie, When heavy grief is in my heart, and tear-drops in mine eye; I call thee, but thou answerest not, all lonely though I be: Wilt thou not burst the bonds of sleep, and rise to comfort me? Oh! wake thee—wake thee from thy rest upon the tented field: This faithful breast shall be at once thy pillow and thy shield; If thou hast doubted of its truth and constancy before, Oh! wake thee now, and it will strive to love thee even more,” &amp;c. &amp;c. “And so it was—our tearful hearts did cling And twine together even in sorrowing; And we became as one—her orphan boy Lisped the word ‘Father,’ as his dark eyes gazed, With their expressive glance of timid joy, Into my face, half pleased and half amazed. And we did dwell together, calmly fond With our own love, and not a wish beyond.” ? “In the autumn time, By the broad Shannon's banks of beauty roaming,” “That little outcast grew a fairy girl, A beautiful, a most beloved one. There was a charm in every separate curl Whose rings of jet hung glistening in the sun, Which warmed her marble brow. There was a grace Peculiar to herself, e'en from the first: Shadows and thoughtfulness you seemed to trace Upon that brow, and then a sudden burst Of sunniness and laughter sparkled out, And spread their rays of joyfulness about,” &amp;c. &amp;c. “When the sacred remnant of my wretched race Gave England's Richard gifts to let them be All unmolested in their misery.” “Answering, there came A deep, low tremulous sound, which thrilled my frame. A moment, that young form shrunk back abashed At its own feelings; and all vainly dashed The tear aside, which speedily returned To quench the cheek where fleeting blushes burned. A moment, while I sought her fears to stay, The timid girl in silence shrank away— A moment, from my grasp her hand withdrew— A moment, hid her features from my view— Then rising, sank with tears upon my breast, Her struggles and her love at once confessed.” “Days, months, and years, rolled on, and I had been A prisoner a century; had seen Change after change among my keepers; heard The shrieks of new-made captives,” &amp;c. “Graceful as earth's most gentle daughters, That good ship sails through the gleaming spray— Like a beautiful dream on the darkened waters, Till she anchors in Killala bay.” “And the Undying One is left alone.” HORACE IN OTHER SHAPES. By various Hands. “To what base uses we return, Horatio!” Lib. I. Carmen VII. Laudabunt alii claram Rhodon, aut Mitylene, &amp;c. Some say that the air is much finer in Paris, Or puff Naples in strains all as soft as its soap; Others laud in their journal the City Eternal, The Piazza di Spagna, the Corso, the Pope:— Some more waste their pennies in tumbledown Venice Or beggarly Florence, where Burgherst is queen; And we've heard some dull villain bepraising of Milan. Some, like mulligatawny, are stuck in Turin;— It me very much puzzles to find what's in Brussels;— As for Spa or Liege, why that's only a bam. Their taste is not much, sir, who, lauding the Dutch, sir, Speak well of that big-breechesed town, Amsterdam. I'd as soon read Tom Roscoe, as sojourn in Moscow, Or in Petersburgh, frosty-faced home of the Czar; And as for your Hamburghers, and all other d? burghers, God keep us from such cursed cattle afar. Let them prate of the Prater, while others so great are On Berlin, where Blucher I knew in old times; But I vow unto you, Nick, that sooner than Munich I'd dwell in, I'd listen to Ludwig's own rhymes. In jack-boots or pattens, away off to Athens, Philhells and bluestockings, dear women! repair; While the Turcophiles ramble to Mahomet's Stambol, But, by Allah!—dear fellow:—you'll ne'er catch me there. As for Stockholm, in Sweden, (which Rudbeck thought Eden,) I'd as lief go to Boulogne or Botany Bay:— He must be a Pagan, who thinks Copenhagen A spot where a Christian could venture to stay. My head I'm not troubling about dirty Dublin, Or Edinburgh city, small place in the north; The first in the Liffey I'd pitch in a jiffy, T'other village might fill some thin creek of the Forth. To conclude—To Madrid, sir, farewell do I bid, sir, And garlicky Lisbon, strong town of Miguel;— So, on casting the tour up of all parts of Europe, I conclude for the sweet shady side of Pall Mall. Lib. III. Carmen XIX. Quantum distet ab Inacho, &amp;c. Don't bother me with your old tales of Plantagenet, Your stories of Richard, or Harry, or Ned, Greater nonsense than such, why, I can not imagine it— We have heard long ago what of them can be said. Come, tell me the place where I'll get the best bottle, The strongest of tumblers, the mildest segars, Or where I'd most chances of wetting my throttle By the fire of a friend, when the coppers are scarce. I call for a bumper—here, waiter, clean glasses!— Here's the moon, or the stars, or whatever you please;— Your health, Jack Mulrooney; so, off with “the lasses” Why, thirty jugs more we'd demolish with ease. Let the poet, God help him!—I see he's half muzzy— Take no more than nine tumblers, that's one less than ten; And those who 've a fancy to shy getting boozy, Should not venture much further than twice that again. So ho! What's the matter? Let's kick up a riot. Here, piper! you ruffian, come blow us a jig;— Do you think, for a moment, I mean to be quiet? If I do, may old Scratch run away with my wig! Make a row! push the bottle! whoop, shout, boys, and caper. Why the deuce should I not raise a tumult and roar? The neighbors, you say, will look sulky and vapor, And so will the pretty young doxy next door;— What? old fellow's friend? Pish! Tom, here is the lady, Black-haired and black-eyed, you 've been courting so long. As for me—fill the glass for the dear Widow Brady Whose three hundred a year wakes your Munsterman's song. THE LAY OF THE DISMAL CRAMP. They made him a bed that was wretchedly damp, And had reason that same to rue, For he awoke in the night with a thundering cramp, And he thumped and he swore, and he kicked out the lamp, With a plague of a hilloa-ba-loo! “Now my lamp is out—not an inch can I see! And snoring the dolts I hear; But short and not sweet their snooze shall be, And I'll lock up the maid, and toss in the key To a butt of their table-beer!” Away, with his dismal cramp, he sped, Though walking you 'd think a bore; And onward he went, with a hop and a tread, Till he stood at the side of the innkeeper's bed, And he bellowed a terrible roar. And the landlady, starting, began to break Her sleep, as he bawled in her ear; Till she cried to mine host—from her dream awake— “Ah what is the row?—sure did n't you spake, Or is it the divil, my dear?” Said the stranger, “You vixen! my bed was damp, I'll be curst if I pay you a screw! And I've locked up your maid, and kicked out the lamp, And you 're in the dark, and I'm losing my cramp, So I'm off with a hilloa-ba-loo!” THE DEATH OF NAPOLEON. 'T is over!—the spirit hath fled, That kept the wide world in amaze; Like a pine-tree all withered and dead; Like a comet all shorn of its rays. Oh! who could have omened of yore, When that comet blazed fierce thro' the sky, That its circuit so soon should be o'er,— That, 'mid shadow and shame, it should die;— That the glory which blinded all eyes that it met, In haze should decline, and in darkness should set! Like an arrow that twangs from the bow, To ascend the blue depths of the sky, Passes over the cloud's snowy brow, And mocks the vain gaze of the eye,— Like the eagle that mightily soars On the far-bearing wings of the blast, Till earth and its vanishing shores Have receded, like things of the past,— Wert thou, dread Napoleon, now lulled to thy rest, 'Mid an isle of the main, with a stone on thy breast. With thy thunders did tremble the world, And thrones at thy bidding did bow; And thy banner, wherever unfurled, Shone triumphantly still to o'erthrow; Like a tree from the front of the steep, Looking down o'er the forests afar; Like dark Teneriffe, shooting up from the deep, That kisses its feet with a jar; So proud didst thou rise o'er the kingdoms of earth, While they crouched at thy feet, joining trembling with mirth. POETICAL PLAGIARIES. “TO MRS. ? “If joys from sleep I borrow, Sure thou 'lt forgive me this; For he who wakes to sorrow, At least may dream of bliss! Wilt thou forgive my taking A kiss—or something more? What thou deny'st me waking, I sure may slumber o'er.” Now, what is this but an amplification of the following?—“Since then I, waking, never may possess, Let me in sleep at least enjoy the bliss, And sure nice Virtue can't forbid me this.” —J. Oldham. BARNEY MOORE; A VISION OF COVENT GARDEN AND ST. GILES'S. Barney Moore, a Vision of Covent Garden and St. Giles's. By Bryan O'Toole, Esq., of Gray's Inn. In ten Visions. Visions I. and II.; 4to. Buckman, London. Muggy, and moist, and slob, and slippery! It wants an hour of sunrise; and the rain Pours down in torrents, and in splashing showers Fills every gutter, steaming with perfume, Rank and indelicate confoundedly. Shrouded in which, as in a frouzy night-cap, Lies the new-woke and cabbage-laded garden, Conscious once more of market-hour's approach. No object all around me is unsoaked— Carts, gardeners, ladies, turnip-tops, police, Soused through and through, swear (such of them as can) In strong expression of the rapped-out oath. Alive is every potatory tap, Wine-vaults or cellar, with their pewter pots And ruin azure-hued; while blandly smiles, Hearing the coppers on the counter roll, The trim-capped bar-maid; and the coves, enwreathed With ladies of the night, brimful of gin, Stagger along in lushy state, and fill The air with odors, from the shortened pipe Puffed frequently; and many a wandering bird, 'Neath the piazzas whispers words of love To knight or squire, in blissful drunkenness, Who sees a double beauty in her eyes. There, beside one small round of deal-board, sit A crew of costermongers, happy all With their mundungus mild, and heavy-wet; And here, safe stored beneath yon canvass awning, An inexhaustible hoard of cabbages, Heaped up against the dinner-hour's demand— Doomed as companion to the beef, or boiled Or stewed, or cooked in manners manifold— Messes which tailors love to feed upon. And, lo! yon watch-house, lying by the church, Choke-full almost—yet all the while still filling With importations of disorderlies, Kicking up rows and shindies far and wide, And all descriptions of loose characters Cramming and crowding, till the lock-up room Sweats with the foes of order; like the land Where Newman Knollys sends his chosen flock; And many a blowen of saloonic fame, Sold to a Sydney settler, is beloved In patriarchal wise: spite of that love, Oft is her seven years' sojourn dimmed with tears, Shed when she thinks on spots which, since the hour The ruthless beaks took her to trap away, Have seen, unvisited by her, the lark, Morning and evening; or upon her pals, Who oft, since she was lagged, have, side by side, In many a boozing ken, drank, morn and night, Ay, all on to the moonlight starriness, Without once knowing that there was a sky. Muggy, and moist, and slob, and slippery! A multitudinous host of coffee-shops! And lo! the Finish opens to receive The remnants of the night. Black horsebeans now Are flowing, coffee-like, with plenteous grounds; And there are goings-on of human life In Bow Street, Hart Street, James Street, White Hart Yard, Behind green window-blinds and yellow curtains. And from his beat the blue-coat Peeler sees And hears the stagger of Corinthian, Singing and shouting, as he scarcely seems To touch the ground with his unsteady foot, And at the last, laid level by a trip, Drops, in full dress, his person in the mud. Murphy! its magic lies upon thee now, The power of Daffy—she it is who bathes With ruin blue as is an angel's eye Whate'er your rolling optics look upon! By many an intermediate link of thought It joins that family of brick and stone, In strange relationship, till the curb-stone, Flanked by the puddle, the mud-girded pavement Where heroes, done by draughts of Deady, sleep, Is mingled with the chimney pinnacle From which yon speck—it is a sweep—sings out. Silent in nature is the unwakened street, For all its coves are snoring fast asleep: But in his daffy-stricken ear a sound Thunders as if a hundred wagons rolled. Where are his pot companions? In dark traps Locked up, some look for Bow-Street in the morn. Of others the imprisoned form is seen By the gruff turnkey as he shoots the bolt Of Newgate, looking o'er Snow Hill below. But he beholdeth, and he heareth all Their chanting and their chaff—the flowing lush, Their pints of heavy—glorying in his soul On their sunshiny feats of crackmanship; Or thinking gloomy of the scragging hour, When Cotton's signal sends their swinging bulk Dancing on nothing in a hempen cravat, That makes its wearer grin like Samuel Rogers. An Irish row! St. Giles's! where the Cork and Kerry men Come down in lashings out of Lawrence Lane. Gossoons Anglicè, boys: from the French garçon. As long as a man can fight, in Ireland, he is called a boy. from Iveragh, O'Connell's land, Or sweet St. Barry's steeple-crowned hill, Thundering to men of Connaught, or of Leinster, To take a leathering that will do them good. The challenged onward sweep, a hundred boys, Shillelah-furnished from the Rose and Crown, Hotels in St. Giles's, the Grillons and Clarendons of the district. Or Jem M'Govern's Hotels in St. Giles's, the Grillons and Clarendons of the district. crib in Buckridge Street: Met in mid way, up gets a quiet fight, Each separate lad knocking his neighbor down; Soon the storm-loving heroes spread the fray From Dyot Street to Broad Street, the career Marked out by broken heads. Down sink the polls Of Jerry Kearney, or Tim Gollogher, Smote by the tempest shower of ash plants dried, Or flying stones—once pavement of the street— Now flung in rocky war. The gathering fight In the long battering 'twixt the Dublin coves And the big broguineers of Munster land, Through those Elysian groves, burst in each lane Into a hundred other smaller rows; Till, lo! subdued by saplings of the South, (Whence potent whiskey flows, though mild to taste) Down sink the men of Erin east and west, Insensibly knocked up by knocking down. And all along the ancient ground of fight Out come the night-capped women to the fray, Squalling advice of quiet to the boys, Leathering or leathered, and remove their husbands In Irish fashion—killed. The first-risen Pat Beholds next morn his much-loved Holy Land All strewn with mud and blood, and sticks and stones, And wigs and hats, which hats can be no more. So to the bar they come—the close girt bar, Thither conducted by a brace of traps, And no mistake ? ?and cheek by jowl, Placed on their perch, distinctly visible, The sisters stand awhile, then leaning over, Blow up the officers in words of slang Like fun; and keep their game eyes steadily Fixed on Sir Richard's mug. One phiz is pale In its own pockmarkedness, but paler seems Beneath the border of her unwashed cap, So sooty-black, contrasting with the red, Deep-seated, of her well-carbuncled nose, Kept purple by her drams. The other foxy As ruddiest reynard, and bedaubed with rouge, In rivalry of all those uncombed locks, Like carrots glittering, o'er her breadth of face Afloat, and from her eyes, some twice a minute, Pushed back with greasy hand. But, oh! those eyes Black all around, but as you closer gaze Yellower and yellower grows the spreading circle That girds around each twinkling orb, befringed With eyelids almost closed upon the eye, And reddened by the constant lush of Booth. MISS PIPSON. The prettiest mouth that man could wish to lay his longing lips on Is that belonging to the sweet and innocent Miss Pipson. O! when she goes along the street, the wink she often tips one, Which makes me feel confounded queer—the cunning wag Miss Pipson. And when the snow-white French kid glove her pretty hand she slips on, She seems the very queen of love—the beautiful Miss Pipson. She is the lawful daughter of her father's father's rib's son, And thus you have the pedigree of elegant Miss Pipson. She is so full behind, you'd swear that she had got false hips on, And yet no bustle doth she wear—magnificent Miss Pipson. She sings and dances vastly well; and when the floor she skips on, You see at once she doth excel—the nimble-limbed Miss Pipson. 'T is dangerous to approach too near her fingers, for she grips one, And puts the soul in bodily fear—the cruel minx, Miss Pipson. But yet you can 't object, although in terror she so dips one; You rather glory in each blow received from fair Miss Pipson. Pain from her hands no more is pain; and even when she nips one, You can not, for your soul, complain—the cruel, sweet Miss Pipson. 'Tis said she carries things so high, that sometimes e'en she whips one; But that, I guess, is “all my eye,”—adorable Miss Pipson. At all events, she tips, and grips, and dips, and nips, and trips one; And therefore I'll have nought to do with beautiful Miss Pipson! THE SPERMACETI CANDLE. “The sovereignest thing on earth, Is 'parmacity ?” Shakespeare. Ye gods immortal! in all time The bard invoketh the aid of the immortal gods. By heavenly zephyrs fanned well, Inspire my bosom while I climb Th' Eolian mount, with steps sublime— The matchless subject of my rhyme A Spermaceti Candle. Dim was each light in days of old, Showeth the miserable inferiority of the ancients in respect of lights. 'Mong Saxon, Goth, and Vandal, Compared with that which now is sold, (Better than tallow, dip, or mould), Whose flame is brighter far than gold— A Spermaceti Candle. Place every kind of light in view, He betteth a pipe of wine in favor of the Spermaceti Candle. And when you 've quietly scanned all, I'll bet a pipe of wine that you Will give the preference unto A Spermaceti Candle. If tallow, therefore, you eschew, If you eschew tallow, and are averse to soiling your fingers, use spermaceti. And are averse to handle, The very best thing you can do Is in its place to substitu- Te a Spermaceti Candle. Its color is as pure as snow, Describeth, with much gusto, the beauty of its complexion, and superiority of its light. Or floors strewed with white sand all; It burneth with a peerless glow— A proof that there is nought below Like a Spermaceti Candle. It needs no snuffing, for the wick, Showeth how it needeth not snuffing, nor becometh cabbaged. So beautiful and grand all, Becomes not cabbaged, faint, or sick— With tallow lights a common trick— But never with that shining stick, A Spermaceti Candle. Tall Etna from his flaming peak, Preferreth its light to that of Mount Etna; useth the Scottish reek, which signifieth smoke. With fiery arches spanned all, Exhibits but a lustre weak, Compared with that bright steady streak, Which cometh unobscured by reek, From a Spermaceti Candle. Our old theatric records say, Relateth an ancient legend concerning the band of Covent Garden Theatre. That Covent Garden band all Once on a time refused to play March, hornpipe, dirge, or roundelay, Save by the pure transparent ray (Allowed to each musician gay) Of a Spermaceti Candle. That Hanoverian genius rare, Showeth how Handel could not compose his Oratorios save by the light of spermaceti. The organ-loving Handel, Could not a single stave prepare, Unless when on his easy-chair He sat, surrounded by the glare Of a Spermaceti Candle. Great Hannibal, Hamilcar's lad, How Hannibal bamboozled Fabius, by means of Spermaceti candles tied to the horns of cows and bulls. Who armies could command well, (Some say much better than his dad,) Once saved himself from rout most sad By means of cows and bullocks mad, Each monster's horns with flames yclad From a Spermaceti Candle. Some praise the sun, and some the moon, Showeth the folly of those who praise the sun and moon. In eloquence quite grand all: A fig for both! I'll beat them soon— The last in May, the first in June— By that incomparable boon, A Spermaceti Candle. I've travelled east, I've travelled west, Spermaceti candles much sought after in Coromandel. I've been in Coromandel, And I can say, without a jest, That both in hall and peasant's nest, 'Tis of its race avowed the best— The Spermaceti Candle. In Abyssinia, where the heat Eke in Abyssinia. Each native's phiz hath tanned well, They deem their happiness complete If any friend whom they may meet Will have the goodness them to treat To a Spermaceti Candle. There 's nothing in the world so bright, Showeth that the belated traveller thinketh with all his might on spermaceti. As you must understand well; Suppose you lose your way at night, What think you on with all your might? Why, to be sure, upon a light- Ed Spermaceti Candle. 'Tis strange that those who love to sing Expresseth surprise that Frosty-faced Fogo, and other laureates of the ring, should have neglected to sing the praises thereof. The deeds of Cribb and Randall— Those potent heroes of the ring— Should never yet have touched the string In praise of that most useful thing, A Spermaceti Candle. A cock-boat by the lightning smit, The citizen who hath not a bit of said candle deserveth much pity. A seventy-four that 's manned ill, Are bad enough, but not a whit, More to be pitied than the cit, Who has not in his house a bit Of Spermaceti Candle. The Grecian maids, so fair and sweet, Maketh a classical allusion to the maids of Greece, and their well-turned understandings. Wore on each leg a sandal; But all their skill was incomplete To show at night their lovely feet Without that accessory neat, A Spermaceti Candle. Live where he may, or far or near, Direful penalty which ought to be inflicted on those who are so sinful as to sneer at a spermaceti candle. He ought to be trepanned well, And made to suffer stripes severe, Imprisonment in cell most drear, Without tobacco, gin, or beer, Who has the heartlessness to sneer At a Spermaceti Candle. May honest men, where'er they be, Adviseth all honest men to brand those who sip their tea or toddy without the light of spermaceti. With indignation brand all Who sip their toddy, or their tea, In wintery nights, by land or sea, Without the cheerful lustre free Of a Spermaceti Candle. Behold yon taper, shining bright Showeth the inferiority of a certain light in a japanned lamp to spermaceti. In lamp that is japanned well, Although it gives a pleasant light, 'T would really seem as dark as night, If but contrasted with the might Of a Spermaceti Candle. If you desire to be renowned Showeth the eminent use of spermaceti in sundry games. At cards, and play your hand well, A clearer help can not be found, (Whether the game be square or round,) Than a Spermaceti Candle. If e'er by chance you sail upon Showeth the Social effects of a spermaceti in the Straits of Babelmandel. The Straits of Babelmandel, Where gas-lights are but little known, You 'll ne'er be dull, nor feel alone, If you have for compan-i-ón A Spermaceti Candle. To place beside it, oil or gas, Showeth the absurdity of comparing oil or gas to the spermaceti candle. Would be a kind of scandal, Which none would think of but an ass (Of whom there are a few, alas!) Who vainly hopes thus to surpass The Spermaceti candle. In short, this luminary bright, Concluding stanza, in which is sententiously summed up the rare qualities of a spermaceti candle. Like baby you might dandle, For cleanliness and giving light, And aspect of a snowy white, There 's nought—especially at night— Like a Spermaceti Candle. I may as well conclude, for if Another conclusion, by way of ending. I wrote another bandle, I could not add a single whiff Which would go further to uplif- T a Spermaceti Candle. SONG OF THE SHIRTLESS FOR THE YEAR THIRTY-THREE BY SIR MORGAN O'DOHERTY, BART. DEDICATED TO ALL TRUE REFORMERS. To the Tune of “Tolderol.” I Welcome, welcome, my gentle reader! Here we have come to thirty-three— Year in which all sides agreed are Many a marvel we shall see. Chant we therefore an opening chorus, Swelling it loud with joy and glee: Here 's to the year that is now before us— It is the year for you and me. Tolderol, lollol, lollol, lollol; Tolderol, lollol, lollol lol. II Up and be stirring, my sturdy neighbor— Up and be stirring—the time is come To shoulder musket and draw the sabre, To cheering sound of trump and drum. Soon shall we hear the firelock prattling— Soon shall the noisy cannon hum— Soon shall the shells in showers be rattling, Sputtered abroad by the jolly bomb. Tolderol, &amp;c. III What shall we fight for, what shall we fight for— What shall we fight for, gossip dear? That which we have so good a right for In this thorough reforming year: Hall and house, and park and palace, Wealth and plenishing, goods and gear, Star and jewel, and plate and chalice, Hose and doublet, feast and cheer. Tolderol, &amp;c. IV Down with coronet, down with mitre, Down with altar, down with throne; Easier shall we be and lighter When this mummery all is gone. King and bishop, and peer and parson, If unhanged, in jail may groan; Long enough they carried their farce on— Now, my boys, the day's our own! Tolderol, &amp;c. V Shout, my brother descamisado— Shirtless brother, come shout with me! Rich and noble will soon be made to Bend to fellows like us the knee. Weep and wail, ye men of riches— Wail, ye men of house and land! Here come we who wear no breeches, Seeking our own with pike in hand. Tolderol, &amp;c. VI Off with Howard, and out with Percy— Down with Stafford and Devonshire; For Duke John Bedford's lands no mercy— Pluck Lord Grosvenor's—worthy peer! We shall soon, for good example, Give the axe its full career, And on the Bar ycleped of the Temple Noble heads we again shall rear. Tolderol, &amp;c. VII Tremble, ye sons of the circumcision— Rothschild's heart may throb with pain; Now is the time for a long division Of all the shents of your godless gain. Visitors worse than Nebuchadnezzar, When he spoiled your sacred fane, More to be feared than Titus Cæsar, Shall invade Bartholomew Lane. Tolderol, &amp;c. VIII Away with schools, with hall, with college— Make them the nests of owl and toad; We know more of useful knowledge Than e'er to Isis or Cam was owed. We teach the art of sack and pillage All by the rule of prime and load; We shall show to town and village That the true teacher is abroad. Tolderol, &amp;c. IX Far and wide shall be cities flaming— Long and loud shall the bayonet ring; Blood on wave and plains shall be streaming— Princes and peers shall on gibbets swing. Honor and justice, faith or pity, We to the idle winds will fling; And is not this a charming ditty, Fit to be sung before a king? Tolderol, lollol, lollol, lollol; Tolderol, lollol, lol. M. O'D. Tower Hill, 1st of the 1st decade of the year I. NONSENSE VERSES. Let the spirit of murphies repine O'er the ocean's dread stultified breast, And dolphins drink puncheons of wine To the murmurs of purified rest. Let bacon and pancakes no more Lord Chancellors of Ireland be made, Lest the Island of Rathlin should snore, And by cholera's pangs be betrayed. No longer let dull Althorp's chest Aspire to the dungeons below, Where reposing on beauty's sad breast, The mountains of Araby glow. For the turmoil of courts and of kings Shall exalt to the skies' dark domain The essence of butterflies' wings, And mingle it there with the slain. Then mute may all sausages be: May the tincture of pestilence spread Its beautiful arms o'er the sea, And gladden the fishes with dread. LAMENT UPON APSLEY HOUSE. What house is yonder, which I with wonder See smashed with plunder and paving-stones— Its shutters shattered, its windows battered, All tore and tattered, like Davy Jones? O! I see it clear O!—it is the Hero Who beat old Boney so clear and clane; The great old Fighter, and smart Delighter, Who with flying banners won the plain. There was Alexander the bould commander, And Mister Hannibal so fine: But if the Rat-catcher was their body-snatcher, By all that's good 't is he would shine! And Julius Cæsar who, like Nebuchadnezzar, Was quite uncommon in his day, But I'd lay you a wager that our old stager, The hook-nosed Duke would have his way. Great is my sadness, and small my gladness, When I perceive his shutters shut— Smathered and battered, besieged and tattered, By the blackguards who are now on fut. And O, by Japers! what sort of capers, You grenadiers, it was yours to show, When the riffle-raffle of the London city Smashed all the panes of our old Beau! Where were the Guards, sir, when the blackguards, sir, Smashed down the panes of the Dear Duke? If Goll and Osgor were here to the fore, 'T is they would never on such stuff look; And there 's Brien Boroo, in battle lading— 'T is he'd for aid in this here fight, And smash the villains, like damned civilians, Over and over, from left to right. Like hungry hawks on a March-day morning, A-slating small birds upon a hill, 'T is they're the covies who are adorning That most particular place they're going to kill. There was great rejoicing, and loud-mouthed voicing, Bawling away about the peace; And in the king's dominions it fled about with pinions, A most plasing remonstrance in the place. There was wondrous beaming and branch-lights flaming, Sweet music a-shameing bagpipe and flute; The windows they were scented, the people were contented, Every thing was happy—both mankind and brute. The deafman and the cripple both together they did tipple, And Erin was rejoicing to the tune of her “go bray;” And 'tis I am hard in heart here, to think that you, Duke Arthur, Are a smash-windowed sort of character this blessed day. FROM ANACREON. When my weary, worn-out eyes Closed to seek a willing peace, And the moon, in midnight skies, Glittered like a shilling-piece— At my door there came a knock, O'er my brow a dizziness; Through the pane I gave a look— “Holloa! what's your business?” There I saw a little boy, Frosty-faced and shivering; Forty arrows, like a toy, Bent his back a quiver in. “Let me in,” he cried, “till day— Lost my road in jogging on; I have got the means to pay, Put your board a noggin on. “Men by mercy show the god— Don't be stupid, pondering; If you send me on the road, I shall die in wandering.” “Enter in,” said I, “my lad; Pale, your cheeks with soda vie; Here 's a fire to make you glad, Here 's a glass of eau de vie.” To the dying flame he drew, Wanted warmth remembering; And his color backward flew, As he puffed the ember in, Then he dried his moistened hair, Then he broached a keg or two, Then he hummed a merry air, Danced, and cut a leg or two. But when he beheld his bow, All his joints seemed sinuous; “Sure,” he cried, “'t is spoilt by snow,” And he twanged continuous. “Lost! oh, lost! unhappy I! If 't is hurt, I die for it! You shall be the bullock's eye, Never will you sigh for it.” Ere again I could exclaim, Fearing some ill luck in it, At my heart he took an aim, And his arrow stuck in it. “That's a hit—my dart is true; Now,” said he, “away for it!” Through a window-pane he flew, And left poor I to pay for it. O'DOHERTY'S CONFESSION. I often told you how I loved her In manhood's early glow; I never told you why I loved her— This you now shall know! 'T is true her stature, shape, and face, Were, all three, queer—but, zounds! The “handsome feature” in her case Was “fifty thousand pounds!” She had an eye, whose lustre lonely Her furrowed phiz illumined; That is, one side and one side only— The other cheek was doomed To darkness deep as death's drear valley, And but for her bright nose No gleam had lent that cheek's blind alley, Such radiance in repose. Well, well, her father lost his money, And she began to look In my fond eyes so strangely funny— It would not suit my book. Could I take off this old man's daughter, His last remaining prop? No, no; I mixed some gin and water, And begged she'd taste a drop. She did so; and, as I'm a sinner, She pulled so wondrous well, That “oh!” thought I, “such rare beginner Will doubtless soon excel!” And, turning to her joyless father, I said, “Flare up, old chap! I wooed her once, but now I rather Think the thread must snap!” The old man's look grew stern and sterner, The maiden seemed to swoon: “So ho!” thought I, “'tis time to spurn her— Does she think me such a spoon? Good bye—good bye—both child and parent, Your cash is gone; and I To nothing being heir-apparent, Will wifeless live and die!” SABBATH JOY. Hurrah! hurrah! the earth and sky Interchange their glances free, And every sweet face that passes by Looks bright with Liberty! The generous front and elastic air Of hearty, hopeful man, Are glad as though life, never stirred with care, To the eternal ocean ran. “This, this is the day the Lord hath made, Be glad, and rejoice therein!” Let no care perplex, no doubt degrade, The soul now bright within! What slave shall dare to cross the path Of our joyous or pensive way? Let him dread the flash of a freeman's wrath, For this is the freeman's day! Look up lone mourner, thy youth hath fled, Thy vigorous manhood 's gone— The hopes of thy life lie cold and dead, And thy heart is left alone! Look up, one free-breathing day is thine, One snatched from the sorrowing seven; Then open thy soul to the ray divine, For the light is a “light from heaven!” 'Tis a light to gladden both young and old Whose foot-way the hell-hounds track, With a thirst to be quenched by naught but gold, And a hate that will never slack. Blessed, oh, blest be the Sabbath morn, When the devils must hide their claws, When a respite is found by the heart forlorn, And misery knows a pause.</field>
