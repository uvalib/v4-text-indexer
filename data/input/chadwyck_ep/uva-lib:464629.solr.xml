Yitte þe saxons durande lang quile Tharned monarchie of þe hile. Þai tharnede lang þe diademe, ffor it wald no? to so fele seme. Þe regne in porcions þai dele; Kynges þai hade sumqwile to fele. Sumqwile yie might her neuen Þai hade amanges þam kynges seuen, And sumqwile thre and sumqwile fife; And amanges þam, lo, ofte ras str[i]fe: Ilkan on oþer als for þar rightes Wele fele siþes chides and fightes. Ama[n]ges þam was grete vnquiete, Ilkane to bring oþer vnderfete. And ek þe britons þai ful yiern Þat drifen er ouer þe flodes seuern Þai [spie] and waite ful eger and frek Qwat tim on þam mak anie escheke. To þam to do þe harmes þai maie Of slik wille neuer mar ces þaie. Austyn passes þe west ce, And in kent þar landys he. Dvrande þase yieres, lo, saint gregor, Or he was pape sumdele bifor, In romes he comes to þe chepings, Qwar bie and selle men vses alþings. ffair childer to selle he sagh þar sette— Marchandes fra fer landes þam fette— ffair of schape, of noble wut, And quite of cors withouten dout. Þar hair it schane so fair and bright, ffair and lofesum in mannes sight. Of þe marchande sone he enquerde Of þase childer þat þar aperde, Qwar he so fair childer fande, Qwat contre and of qwat lande, Qwat high þe folk of quam þam cam, And ek qwat was þar kinges name. Marchande ansuerde, þe soth to saine, He hade þam broght out of britaine. “Þat ledisse folk certes er paighiens Þat slik fairede of cors sustens. Paigiens er alle, þe soth to spelle; Anglais es þar name þat þar duelle. Derie es calde þe prouince; Kyng elle forso? so hatte þar prince.” Saint gregor to sighting him turnes And in his herte he wepes and murnes. He saide: “allace, men of slik face Of mighti godde sulde tharne þe grace; Of so far forme slik childer and barnes Knawing of þar creatour tharnes; Þe fende slik childer haf in pouste, So uoutable in mannes sight to se. Anglais þat name þat sounes a[n]gels, Þat euer in goddes presens duels. In uout to angels þai er lik, In saule for so? þai sulde be slik. Of derie, lo, hider þai soght; ffra goddes ire þam agh be broght. ffra þe deuels regne þai sal be tak, And cristenmen gode to godde þam mak. To goddes regne þai sal be calde, His willes in erde to do and halde. And elle þe name of þar king To mightie godde it sounes lowing. Godde salle be louede in þase contres Qwar childer haf angels uout men ses.” In pape was sacrede, lo, saint gregor; To fulfille þis he hade memor. He sendes sone within brefe quile Diuine prechours to britains hile: Saint augustine, mellite, iohane With oþer saint monkes many ane, Þase aenglisemen for to conuerte, Til godde of heuen to turne þar herte. In þe yiere of þe incarnacion Of our lorde iesum, godde son, ffife vndre? four score fife siþes thre Augustine passes þe weste cee. Rifande to lande his schipe he sette In to ane hile es calde thanette. With him þar wer of monkes and men Bi number welner four siþes ten. King adelbert þis tiþandes lidde. Of kynges of kent he was þe thridde, Sen þe aenglis kynges to regne bigonen And þe regne of britons had wonen. Of aenglis kinges he was þe maste; Mar þan his aeldres he had purchaste, Þat his empir þoru kent it stode And sua strekande to vmbres flode. He sent worde: it was his wille In þat ilke hile to halde þam stille Vnto þat he þam to him calde. Alle þar message her certes he walde. Kyng adelbert bifor þat tim Hade herde or þase monkes com to him Of cristenmennes religion. ffor his selfe in condicion Of kinges of france tok his wife, Bertha scho hight, þat alle her life Her awne cristen troght to halde; And alle her meigne so þai salde. Kyng adelbert after daies fone To thanettes hile he come sone. Saint augustine he with his fers Towardes þe kyng qware he apers— So deuotelie, lo, þam amang Þe letanie wel loude þai sang— A siluer croice bifor him borne, He come and stode þe kyng biforne. He schewede þe kyng qware for he come, ffra gregor sent, þe pape of rome. Of iesum criste with wordes balde To þe kyng and his he saide and talde, He schewede þam þoru many reson Þat iesum criste es goddes son. He prechede þam þoru wordes lele Þe right troght for mannes hele, Withouten qwilk in herte to hafe It suld nane erdelik man be safe. Austyn with miracles wondyrs and prechyng Convertyd angland to iesum kyng. Kyng adelbert þus he ansuerde To augustine wordes he herde: “ffair er þe wordes and þe hetinges Þat þou to vs now schewes and bringes. Bot neu þai er and vncertaine. I mai noght for slik wordes to saine Suffer þe laughe leghlie refusede, Qwilk lang time aenglis folk as vsede.

Within þat we hafe auisement Qwat troght to halde we wille assent. And to yow we na þing vs greue; Bot to alle folk we gife gode leue Þat with fre wile til yow wille cum Of yow for to tak cristendum.” Kyng adelbert gaf a mansion To augustine qware he sulde won, Þar within dorobernes cite, Cantorbir now named to be. Þar augustine and ek his fers Alle þe pople he preches and lers. Yia, goddes worde, lo, þai preched þan; In water þai cristenede many aman. Godde grantede to þam for mannes hele Miracles and wondres to scheu so fele, Þat mikel folk vnto þam ran In iesum criste to trowe bigan. And þar maulmettes þai deniede, And with loude voice þai saide and criede: “Goddes fra setes celestiene Amanges erdelik men þis daies er sene.” Kyng adelbert with dukes and princes And alle þe nobleste of þe prouinces ffalse goddes renaide þai and forsok, And cristendum in water þai tok. And siþen folk plentiuouse anogh To cristendum ful yiern þai drogh. Alle þe folk so with in fone yiers Þe laughes of halikirk so lers, Þat cristende wer alle þe folk of kent And ek welner to þe flode of trent. Within þat, lo, saint augustine Þe pople to criste for to encline Þoru saint gregore comandement To areles, þe cite, he went; And of ether, þe archebischope þare, Augustine was sacrede ful yiare In archebischope, to haf þe state Ouer aenglis folk to be primate. He comes agains and sone he gerte Þoru assent of kyng adelberte fforso? in cantuares cite Ordaine metropolitanes see, Amiddes cite of cantuare His see to stande for euermar, Þe dignite þare þat in form stonden Pape eleuther stabliste in londen. In cantorbir within schorte tide Þoru þe kyng and him was edifide A monastre, sacrede in þe honour Of mighti godde, our salueour. Þe qwilk monastre stabliste it dours ffor him and alle his successours. Anoþer monastre in þe suburb ffor beriels, na man to destrub, Reale he made for þe berielles Of bischopes and kynges in kent duelles. In þe qwilk stede þe kyng yielbright A fair kirk he parailde and dight In þe worschipe of peter and paule ffor hel of cristen men saul. At rofe he mad a suffragane, Bischope se in london made ane. And in oþer stedes ek of þe lande Qwar able him þught and maste semande, Amanges cristen folk englais He raisede kirkes and abbais. Or augustine come to britaine To preche þe troght of criste certaine, Mikel of þe hile was of misse lede Als fer so englais occupede, Þoru fals goddes made so blinde, Þat in þar witte þai cuth no? finde How to cum out of þar errour, Þoru troght to knaw þar creatour. And þe contres quar britons duellde Yitte þe cristendum þai helde. Þe lede þai helde als wise and yiape Þai had of eleuther þe pape. In þat troght þai had lifed lang; It ceste ne falde neuer þam amang, Þof þe saxons amanges þam wonde And þar troght ful mikel hade stonde And drifen þam hade out of þar thede. Bot euer forth in þar troght þai yiede. Austyn com to bangor with good menyng To viset þe trouth brittons stod in. In to wales came saint augustine To visite þe troght britons stode In. And qwen he come in to þar lande, Seuen bischoperikes in wales he fande, And ane archebischoprik of þa, Abbais and oþer nonneres ma, With able bischopes amanges þam stabliste In gode troght stode of iesum criste. Monkes and pristes in monastres won In right order of religion, Amanges alle oþer religions Of monkes in order of þe britons. He comes in to bangores cite; A noble abbaie þar findes he. In þat abbaie he findes þare fful gret number of monkes ware. Þai dueld als in four porcions; Priors to sette amanges þam wons. In þe monastre diuisede þai were; Ordre of religions alle þai bere. Of þase porcions made had [nan] lesse Þan thre vndre? monkes to gesse. And alle in order lifede fair and wele, Sustend with trauaile manuele. Þar abot certes he hight dinok, Þat ledde þam alle in goddes yiok, A man anogh religiouse To gouern and lede goddes house. Wele lerede he was and cuth gret parte Of alkins maner of liberaile arte. Augustine haskede subgections Of alle þe bischopes of þe britons. Entice þam certes he walde and gere To laughis of þe englis þam bere, Obediens with þam to mak, Comun trauaile with þam to tak, With þar licens goddes worde to preche, Þar primacie ouer þam to reche. Þe britons againe ansuers and sais: Na þing to do with þe englais Þarto nane of þam assentes. Þai prouede with diuerse argumentes And ek þoru fele resons and lagh To þe aenglais agh þam no? to dragh, In þar subgection for to be, Sen þai had archebischopes see And of þam selfe þai hade primate, Of aelde tim confirmede his state. And þe aenglais, so al þe warlde ses, Hafes refte þam þar propre contres And þoru lang tim ful mikel þam d[er]de, Put þam out of þar propre erde. And euer redie yitte er þai efte Refe þam þar partie þat þam es lefte. Qwarefor þam agh, þai saide and suare, Haf þam in hate for euer mar.

Bot serue þai walde iesum goddesson In stedefaste troght, so þai wer won, Vnder þar primate, þai sai and sege, And vse þar propre priuilege, Qwilk þai hade vsede so lang bifor, ffour vndre? yiere and ner thre score, In þat ilke troght to dur and lifen Þe pape eleuther had þam gifen. ffor erdelik dout þai walde no? lette To halde þase laughes þe pape þam sette. Lo, adelbert, þe kyng of kent, Qwen he hers þe britons assent, Of þam him þoght ful gret dedeigne Britons slik willes for to demeigne, Þat þar bischopes wald noght encline Subgection mak to augustine. Þat þai amanges þam suld despise Prechung of augustine so wise, Slik þinges of þam he tok to grefe. Consaile he tok wel schort and brefe. He gadrede power on ilke side: Of northumbre kyng edilfride And oþer kynges of aenglande He procured þam with him to stande, Ba? aithen kynges and ek cristen, Doghtie of armes in land he wisten. So a gret oste same he broght, Towardes bangor cite he soght, In þat cite with willes thra With swerde withouten lette to sla Þe abote dinok and ek his clerkes, Þat haly men wer and of gode werkes, fforqui þai þam despisede hade And ek na subgection made Til augustines dignite, Sen þai clamed cristenmen to be. At bangor was sclane with dynt of swerd Two hundreth and fourty monkes interd. King adelbert and kyng adelfride And oþer of þar assent þat tide, Kynges and dukes, to þam assoste, Gadred þai had a stren?ful oste. With many a knight and many A prince Þai entrede in to britons prouince. Þai come to logecestres cite; Duk brochmaile þarin was he. Duk brochmaile þar he abade With alle þe strengh he with him hade. Comen þai wer to þe same cite Of britons fra diuerse contre So fele monkes and heremites, Þat in þase prouinces habites, Bischopes, abotes, and pristes fele, In goddes seruice deuote and lele. And ek of þe cite bangore Þider wer comen ful many a scor Of monkes worthie, saint and deuote, With saint dinok, þe hali abote. Alle wer þai in afflictions, In mornings mak processions. Þai praiede with gret deuocion ffor þe poples saluacion. Slik ostes gadrede so gret number Edelfride, þe kyng of northumber. fforso? þase daies he walde na wester Þan þe cite of legecestrie. With alle his strengh he sette bataile With legecestrie duk brochmaile. Þe duk with litel number of knightes Againstandes and with him fightes. Quiles stren? might dur, he faght fulfast; He lefte þe cite at þe laste. Bot gret harmes and sorow he wroght On his famen þat on him soght, Iquiles he was in bataile stedde, Or he lefte þe cite and fledde. Kyng edelfride þe cite tok, Qwilk þe britons fledde and forsok. And qwen he vnderstandes and knause Of þase monkes comyng þe cause, fforqui his selfe was eithen man, On alle cristen men ra? he ran. He lofede noþer monk ne priste, He haitede alle þat trowede in criste. He bade þai sulde of þam non spare, Bot sla alle doune bifor þam ware. And sua þai slo? þat daie with swerde Alle þase þar funden, laude and lerde, Of monkes in order so hali men Twa vndre? and four siþes ten, Alle þase in pure martirdum Til heuenrik blis worthie to cum. Criste þai seruede with pure des[i]res; Þai schedde þar blode als pur martires, Worthie made to worschipes grete, Of heuenrik purchas þe sete. Kyng adelbert was no? in wille Þase halie men to sla ne spille. He walde þase daies nane armes ber Þam to werde ne ek to der, Namar oþer dukes of þe oste, Cristen kynges to him assoste. To rin on þam greteli þai groched; Nane of þam with ille þam tochede. Of þe saxons kyng edelfride Of his done slaghter him þoght gret pride, And forth he wrogh so [a] tiran, Þat so of cristen men bigan. Towardes bangor welra? soght he Also for to destroie þat cite. Alle þe dukes þat were in wales Of him þai herde so felons tales. Same gadrede dukes slik: Of cornewaile þe duk blederik, Margadude, kyng of demecie, With alle his strengh of bachelrie, And cadwane, kyng of venedoce, And alle þai might to þam asoce. Alle þis assemblede and come to gider; To bangors warde þai hiede þam þider. Þai yiede againes him on gate And in bataile with him þai smate. Þar partise faght, so þai wer wode; Kyng edelfride þe wer him stode. Gret number of his folk was slane, And his selfe ful mikel ouertane. Britons him sare wondede in fight; Þoru strengh þai put him sone to flight. Of saxons amede thousandes ten Sextie and sex slane of his men, Kyng adelfride selfe wondede sare, And so forfoghten he moght namar; And ek his folk so harde was stedde, He and þai lefte þe felde and fledde. Of þe britons side slane in bataile Blederik, þe duk of cornewaile, Þat ledeseman was forto gouern, Alle þe britons in fight to lern. Her was a cord maid and endyng Of cadwalon and edelfrid þe kyng.

Lo, cadwan tok þe diademe, Þe britons to gouern and yieme. Þai sagh þai hade A kyng of neu; Lo, þai bigin to him to seu. Þai him ensuede, and at þe laste Ouer humber flode sone þai paste. Qwen þis to edelfride was talde Þe britons come on him so balde, Alle þe kynges of þe saxons He þam asoste to him essons. And suo he wendes þam againes With þam to mete suo in þe plaines. In felde þai come anens þar lede, Aiþer redie of oþer haf dede. And þar batailes, lo, þai stabliste So in þe beste asise þai wiste.

Cadwalon was drifen his reine fro, Kyng edwyn gaf hym bataille so. Fulwra? was þan þe kyng edwin Kyng cadwalon suld sua bigin In his coron for to do lette; His desturbance at noght he sette. Cadwalon dueld nalangre þare; Edwin with him wald spek namar. In to northumbre kyng edwin went; He gaf na mar of his assent, ffor him, he saide, he wald no? lette Þe diademe on hiede to sette. He sent him worde þat neuer he roght Qweþer it wer his assent oþer noght. He com to þe cite of eborwik, And solempned, so his self wald lik, On his heide he name þe coron Withouten assent of cadwalon. He said so forth euer vse he salle At his wille diademe regale. Kyng cadwalon he herde fulsone Tald him how kyng edwin had done. Cadwalon to edwin againe Sent þus bi legates certaine Þe diademe þat he salle leue, Elles wald it be to him fulgreue; ffor elles he walde it fra him tak, Þoru stren? mak him britaine forsak. He sulde no? suffer durande his quile Him corond within brataines hile. Na coron he bade þat he sulde bere; Leue it þoru fors he sulde him gere. So bituen þam ras gret descorde, Neiþer walde do for oþer worde. And within þatte his men and hisse Þoru trespas done ful ofte of misse, And ofte þai mette and same faght, And aiþer of oþer gret harmes laght. Aiþer folk for oþer yiemede þar bundes, And fulgrete harmes þai tok ofte stundes. And, lo, it tide with willes thra To felde fellie com þase kynges tua: Kyng cadwalon with his britons And alle in his subgection wons, With his ostes he gadrede so grete, Ouer vmbre contres edwin to threte; And kyng edwin with stren? anogh With gret willes agains him drogh. On northside vmbre to gider þai mette; Þar batailes sone samen þai sette. fful harde þai faght durand wele lang, So ilke man oþer to þe grunde dang. Lang was or þai of fight wald stint, Kyng cadwalon þe felde he tint. Many thousandes of men he loste, Nedelinges his selfe to flight he moste. So harde in fight his self was stedde, Vnnes awaie northward he fledde Sumquile bi strete, sumquile bi stie; So he tok in to albanie. Bot þar na lang recete he fande; He paste to þe hile of hirlande. ffra kyng edwin þe victor wan, Slane in felde so many a man, Welra?, lo, he his ostes ledde In suth britaine fra stedde to stedde, Þoru out alle þe britons contres Sette fire in fele of þe cites, Destroide and slo? þe citisaines And þe til?men wer him againes. Gretelie he þam derede and noiede And alle þar godes waste and destroiede. Qwiles he was so cruel þat qwile, Kyng cadwalon als in exile He gat him stren? and ek nauie In his contres for to applie. fful ofte to rife certes he biginnes, Bot neuer he might entre winnes. Qwat hafen so he arife bigan, Edwin to turne agains him ran. Edwin, þat euer on him ensude, Com with his so grete multitude, Þe portes and þe entres forsette; So him to entre ofte siþes he lette. To him was comen a wiche fulwise, Þat mikel cuth of diuerse sorcerise, Comen of þe landes of hispaine, Of þinges to cum bifor to saine. Þis ilke mages, pellite he hight, He cuth knau þoru foghles flight And ek yitte þoru þe curs of sternes Of þinges comande slik signes him wernes. And suo þoru his craftie wisedum He talde þe kynge alle þinges to cum. Sua euer quen þe kyng cadwalon Suld arife, so he was won, Pellite sone of his comyng he talde. Kyng edwin suo certaine and balde At þe hafens sone him againe stode, Periste his fers in cees flode, And turnede him so at þe bank, Þat mikel of his nauie he sank. Kyng edwyn was conuertyd her And toke þe fayth with ful gud scher. With in þase daies þe kyng edwin Þoru miracle and wordes of saint paulin, His selfe and mikel of his kyngdum, To þe trou? of iesum criste þai cum. Of kyng edwin þe acheson Made him treu in iesum goddesson: In missetroght firste his life he ledde; A cristen maiden he couaitede to wedde, Wedde edelberg was iolden his herte, Þe kynges doghter, adelberte. To eadbalde, þe kyng of kente, Her to hask certes legates he sente. Bot her broþer, þe kyng eadbalde, Againes þe mariage he talde. To þe legates he ansuerde and saiden: An paigien and an cristen maiden Mai no? acorde, aknawen it is, Þe sacriment for to vilis. Bot kyng edwin grauntede þar wille, Þe maiden to haf, for to fulfille. Sua þoru a corde stabliste and sette Kyng edwin in naþing sulde lette Þe maiden and alle þat with her won To halde þe cristen religion. So he her tok þat him was dere Als of his regne in þe neghende yiere. Archebischope iuste of cantorbir Sacrede paulin and sent with hir Þe cristen men in treu? to yieme In her curt du[e]lde, so it walde seme, And oþer if any man walde cum ffra þe false trou? to cristendum. Þat time kyng edwin, so men saide, With kyng of westesex he werraide. To saint paulin he sware and hight, Vencus his fas if þat he might, Þe kyng of westesex, quintolin, Þe landes in werre to him to win Þoru helpe of criste, he suld no? targe In criste to trou with willes large. ffeght with þat kyng fulmikel he dredde ffor þe grete stren? he with him ledde. Kyng of westesex againes him standes Of armed men with many thousandes. In felde mette kyng edwin and he; fful eger bataile þar was to se. Bot kyng edwin þe maistrie wan And grete periles aschapede þan. In felde he slo? kyng quintolin, And alle þe regne he cesede him in. Kyng edwin so ioyful and glade Purchaste to him þe regne he hade. To his contre he comes againe, Of treu? ek he walde be certaine. Paulin iquiles of iesum prechede; To mikel folk þe trouth he techede. Þe kyng consaile of wisemen tok, Alle his mallmettrise he forsok. Alle slik figurs, falsegoddes, idoles In fire he keste and brinde to coles. He pupliste his confession: He trowede in iesum goddesson. With saint paulin he him auisede, And on paskedaie he was baptisede, Dai nexte bifore aprile calendes, With þe worschipe þarto apendes. Þe yires of date þat tim it stode ffra goddes son tok fleis and blode Sex vndre? and twenti and seuen And of his regne yieres elleuen. Þat daie with him, lo, alle þe princes, Dukes and knightes of his prouinces To iesum criste, lo, þai þam turne And cristenede wer in watres burne. And siþen so forth daie bi daie Tak cristendum yiern fluede þaie, Þoru þe prechung of saint paulin Þe rene of heuen als for to win. And þar in eborwikes cite A temple was he had wroght of tre In þe worschipe of siluer maulmettes, Qwilk he for false and vaine arettes. Sone he þam out of temple keste. He dide it sacre and made honeste, Mare solempne, better and sweter, Als in þe worschipe of saint peter. And he gaf ane archebischopes see, In þat ilke kirk stabliste to be, To be þe toþer aenglandes primate, Confermede in alle þe aunciene state, Confermede of þe apostoile of rome, His pallion fra þeþen to come. ffra vmbre north to cathenes ce Alle sulde be to his dignite.

Þai sagh þe folk felons and curste; Duel amanges þam certes þai ne durste. After edwin in anguise slik Als nexte of blode regnede osrik. Osrik to him gret folk assoste, So he assemblede a fulfair oste Of englis and of scotes and pecthes, And with kyng cadwalon he fightes. Kyng cadwalon in felde he faght With alle his knightes sette and taght Opon osrik, kyng of northumbre. Of folk was slane fulgret numbre.

Qwen dede was osrik and edane And after so mikel folk was slane, Þan rase þe noble kyng oswalde, So nexte of blode þoru right he salde. Of northumbre he nam coron To regne so his aeldres was won.

Saint berin come, þe so? to saine, In to þase partise of britaine, Þat in errour yitte hofed and duelde. Þe troght of criste he prechede and spelde. Mikel of westesex, þe pople iewise, Out of errour he made þam rise, And to right troght he þam conuerte, Til iesum criste he turnede þar herte. Þe kyng kengille cristendum nam And alle þe princes þat with him cam And contre folk withouten numbre. Þat daies þe kyng of northumbre, Oswalde, in to westesex he soght, And oþer godemen with him he broght, Þe kinges doghter kengille to wedde; At dorcestre assignede þe stedde Þar he þoru saint berin gifte Þe kyng kengille of watre he lifte; And suo his hasking to fulfille He weddede þe kynges doghter kengille, To life in þe laughes of Iesum criste; Berin solempnede office of priste. Lo, ba? þis kynges with willes fre Þai gaf in dorcestres cite In cristes worschipe to saint berin A bischopes see þar to bigin. Saint berin þar was sacred prelate, Of þam to haf spiritual state. Kirkes he raises, alters he settes, He destroies phanes and alle malmettes. Þar alle his daies with willes bousum Þe pople he preched of cristendum. He traualde iern in dede and steuen Þe folk to sette in waies to heuen. Oswald, þat blissed kyng þan, Sent for aydane þat hooly man. Oswalde come hame in to his lande; His folk in diuerse troght he fande: Sum wer paigiens, and sum wer cristen, Ilke men lifede so þam selfe listen. Amanges þam he fande na doctour Þat cuth þam bring out of errour. Saint paulin fra þam he was went And tok his duelling stedde in kent. After him he lefte iacob, his clerk, Þe pople to teche of gastelie werk. Iacob in eborwik him held, Þe troght to safe yern he him melde. He held him mikel in þe cite, ffor na pes was in þe contre. Saint oswalde ses his folk misfair fforqwi þai wanted gasteli lair, Þe troght periste and welner schent. In to scotelande welra? he sent To sek þar in agode wiseman Þat wele þe cristen laughes can, His folk to teche in þis warlde here How right to life, of criste to lere. And of þase scotes of birth wer maste An holiman, lo, he purchaste. Lo, þai to him sent saint aydan, Better in þar lande hade þai nan, An haliman rightwise and gode, Þat goddes laughes wele vnderstode, Bischope bousum and a tempre, Of saint life and of gret pite. Þe kyng oswald him gaf þat quile A see in lindisfarnes hile. Bischop aydan þe pople he prechede, And in his tong þe troght he techede Ba? to pouermen and ek to riche. Bot þai vnderstode no? his speche. He was man of scotes linage, He cuth no? wele aenglise langage. Þerfor þe kyng, so fair to se, Biside him stode with willes fre. Þe wordes he harde of þe bischopes muth, Als man þat diuerse speches cuth, After him he schewed þam with god cher Þat alle his folk þam might her. ffor þe kynges edwines successours Þai fel in missetroght and errours. So dide folk in þe north contre were, ffel in apostasie welnere. Þe troght so yiode to apairement. Þarfor þoru goddes awn assent To regne þai wer no? sufferd lang, Þar famen sone opon þam thrang. So wi? in tim breue and hastife Þai loste þe regne and ek þar life. Osrik and alle þat with him helde To dede he was in þe feld felde, And eamfride, saint oswalde broþer, Dukes and knightes so many oþer. Saint oswalde comes, qwen þis was done, And with him he hafes folk bot fone. He had þan bot alitel oste Of aenglise folk to him asoste. Þe weride duk of þe britons Alle þe folk of northumbre he stons. Kyng cadwalon had lefte him þare Þase contres to waste and make bare, Þe north contre to sla and sprefe And nankins godes with þam to lefe. In oste he hade so fele thousandes, Nane aenglise men agains him standes. Lo, on him comes þan kyng oswalde, In cristen tro? afermede so balde. Lo, saint oswald, worthi and digne, Of þe saint croice raisede asigne Als in þe defens of his right, Or he bigan þat daie to fight. He sette him doune opon his knes, Þat alle þe folk of his oste ses. So he bisoght þar in his voice Iesum criste, þat diede on croice, Þat he sulde helpe and do succours Vnto his folk, þat him honours, Þat dai in þar so grete nede Als in þar right þam forto spede. And suo of his praiers he rase, And in þe felde he tok his plase. Sa in bataile to gider þai smite, And sone his famen wer scomfite. ffirste in meting þai faght fulfaste Many was slane, fele awaie paste. Þe britons duk, þat was so kene, Þat rasede him slik emprise sustene, Þat naman might stande him againe, Þat dai in bataile was he slaine In þe stedde men calles dinisborn; And alle his folk þe bak þai turn. Þe felde es halden, þe so? to saie, In gret worschipe vn to þis daie, Qwar saint oswalde þe prise he wan, Of his famen slane many a man. Kyng oswald was done to scla Be þe handys of kyng peanda. Kyng cadwalon, after þis was wroght, With fulgret stren? þe north he soght. Þe kyng oswalde gretelie he noiede; On him his contres he destroiede. Lang tim he made him vnquiete, Him and his folk broght vnderfete. He suffrede him nakins pes hafe, ffer in to þe north he him drafe. His folk he slo?, his landes he waste, Him selfe ouer þe walle he enchaste, Qwilk þe emperour of rome seuere Had raised bifor so many a yiere. He raisede þe wal[l]e, þe so? to saine, Bituen þe scotes and ek britaine Als fra þe ta ce to þe toþere, ffor neiþer folk sulde ride on oþer. Cadwalon þan sent peandas, Paigien kyng of mercherie he was, And a g[re]te partie of his oste Vnto him þat tim he asoste To þe same stede for to trauaile, On oswalde kyng fight in bataile. Kyng oswald was bi þe walle sides. In þe same stede, lo, he abides, Þe qwilk stede es calde heuenfelde; Þar he abides bataile to yielde. Bot, lo, it tides þe kyng oswalde In þat ilke stede heuenfelde es calde Durande a night alle sides about Seged peandas and his rout. Oswald a croice puruaide he hade; A pite siþen in þe claie he made. His selfe þe croice sette in þe pitte, Qwar folk maie se a croice stand yitte. He it enbraste with ba? his handes And helde it vp right, so it standes, Iqwiles his knightes þar to keste Moldes and stanes to stande it feste. And qwen he hade his werk finiste, Þe croice amanges þam so stabliste, In iesum criste he him afiede. To alle his oste þes wordes he criede: “On knes, myn feres, sette we vs alle, To mightie godde of heuen we cal[l]e. Him, a godde suthfaste and veraie, In comun now with herte we praie: He vs defende, ba? stille and loude, ffra þis gret oste so stoute and proude, ffra þe kyng of britaine, cadwalon, Þat wille destroie our nacion, ffra peandas proude and felons, Þat ledeseman es his britons, Sua þat we falle no? in þar hende; Þoru his mercie he vs defende. Certes godde his selfe anens our state Alle þe soth he knawes and wate, Þat for our folk and for our right Our assent es in felde to fight. ffor our folk hele, lo, we trauaile And vndertakes rightwise bataile.” Lo, alle þai dide his comandement Towardes þe croice in gode atent. Þai knelde, criede with loude voice: Safe þam he sulde, þat diede on croice. And so þe daie bigan to spring, Lo, with his oste oswalde, þe kyng, With peandas batailde him biforn— Same þai faght welra? at morn. Kyng oswalde sone þe maistrie wan, Þe britons scomfite awaie ran. Kyng cadwalon sone qwen he hers Þat scomfite wer his bachelers And to him come kyng peandas, Þat neulings in felde scomfit was, ffulsone he smate in angre and ire; To wrek him he hade grete desire. Alle his oste he gadrede to him; On kyng oswalde he faght þat tim. To romaines walle of þe northside, Qwar kyng oswalde him walde abide, On þe north side romaines walle Es þe place heuenfelde þai calle. Oswalde hade alitel oste, ffight with þam þar nedelings he moste. Asted fulner þai calde it burne; Abide þam þar he walde no? scurne. ffulhard in felde to gider þai faght; And sone ful vtrage harmes þai laght. Þar famen wer so many and fele, Þai hade na stren? with þam to dele. Kyng oswald selfe in feld was slane And of his men welner ilkane. Peandas, mercherie kyng paigiene, Þat daie in felde, felons and kene, On cristenfolk wroght sorow anogh. Saint oswald with his handes he slo?, And he smate of his armes tua, And suo he dide his hiede alsua. He dide þam hing vp in hegh tres In wo[n]dring to alle þam ses. Þan hade he slane kynges thrin: Oswalde, osrik, and kyng edwin. Kyng oswyn was maid kyng of alle ffro north humber to þe romes walle. Heuenfeld certes þe stede men calles Qwar oswalde kyng and his folk falles. And yitte men sais a croice þar standes Qwar oswalde sette an with his handes In his worschipe mankinde boght dere, To þe quilk croice yitte euerilke yiere ffrers of escoldesham er won To mak deuote procession At þe daie of his martirdum, And ek þe contre folk þai cum.

Bot þe coron to yiem he dreghien Regnand kyng yieres bot neghien. And so he diede, godde to queme, ffor cristen folk he hade to yieme, Þe yieres of criste þat writen sua Sex vndre? yiers fourtie and tua. Regne after him was sene bigin Of northumbre his broþer oswin. Kyng oswin sagh his broþer so slane With thousandes of men many ane, In þe toþer yier it tide sum tims He nam doune saint oswalde lims. To lindesfarnes kirk he bare Saint oswalde heide and lefte it þare. Þe handes with þe armes so hale He bare to þe cite regiale, Þam in saint petres kirk to hafe, Amanges relikes þam þar to safe. Þe cors he bare to bardanaie, He delfed it þar in þe abbaie. Qwen kyng oswin had tane coron Als kyng in þe northumbre to won, He sagh wele he might haf na gale Þar to mainten coron riale, Bot he might haf þe pes certaine Of cadwalon kyng of britaine. Of cadwalon, so gret A sire, Þat of alle britaine hade empire, Haf his pes certes nedelinges he wolde. Gret giftes he gaf of siluer and golde To cadwalon, þat bar him maste; Sua pes of him, lo, he purchaste. He yialde him to kyng cadwalon, To regne in his protection, Him and alle his to be in pes, Alkins distance bituene þam to ses. Afterwarde als enemise and fas His nexte frendes againes him ras. ffirste his awn son, edelfride, Againes his fader bigan to ride. With him his broþer son, oswalde, He saide fra him haf þe regne he salde. In na place þai againe him stode, Bot euer vnder fote þai yiode. And qwen þai suo nankins gale fande On him þoru stren? to win þe lande, Ouer humbre, lo, ba? þai pas To þe paigien king peandas, Kyng of mercherie; to him þai fledde. Þai talde him alle how þai wer stedde.

Þai saide and suare it was þar right, And þoru his helpe haf it þai might. Þai suare fra þai win þe coron Þerof gife him large porcion. Kyng peandas, felons and curste, Mak werre certes he ne durste. He durste no? raise slik acontek; Ne ek þe pes he walde noght brek Kyng cadwalon, so wele he wiste, Þoru britaines kyngdum had stabliste. With þam to rife he targed þan; ffor he durste vnquiete naman, Ne rase contek, ne werre bigin Þase daies britaines hile within, Riche ne pouer to der ne greue, Bot he hade kyng cadwalon leue. Þerfor sumqwile yitte he walde targe, Til he might be mar at þe large, Leue to purchace on sumkins wise Againes kyng oswin for to rise, Mak cadwalon assent þar to, Withouten qwam he durste no? do. Tide come, kyng peandas [so balde] To cadwalon certes wende he walde. Him to entice he sulde no? blin Againes oswin with ille to rin. Oþer ells sone he sulde him graunt On oswin kyng contek to haunt. Cadwalon to worschip pentecoste His lordes gart calle both best and moste. To come A solempne fest þat yier, Qwilk al folk helde solempne and der, Of pentecoste þe solempnite. Kyng cadwalon with willes fre Þat daie he walde bere diademe, So to his dignite walde seme. And solempne sua he walde þat feste With alle his princes maste and leste. To london wer þai boden and calde, Þar was his wille þe feste to halde. Alle englise kynges was þar þat daie, Bot anelie oswin was awaie. And alle þe dukes of britaine Com at þe daie assignede certaine. Qwen þis gret feste it was fulfilde, So cadwalon his selfe wilde, Kyng peandas, qwen alle was done, To cadwalon he com fulsone. He haskede þe kyng cadwalon Qwarfor and for qwatkins cheson Kyng oswin fra of northside trent At his gret feste mak him absent, Qwi he was awaie him allane, Sen oþer wer comen euerilkeane, Sen alle princes com of þe saxons, And alle dukes within britaine wons. Kyng cadwalon þis wordes hers, To peandas þus he ansuers: “I wate for þe cause of sekenes Þis daie kyng oswin absent es. Excusede he es anens his state: He mai no? trauaile, wele I wate. If he hade bene man hale and fer, Þis daie forso? he hade bene here.” Peandas þan spak wordes ma; To him he saide: “it es no? sua.

Þerfor he haskes his wille and leue Þe kyng oswin in slaghtre to greue, In sum þinges for to stem his wille Or he his compassement fulfille, Ou[þ]er him to sla oþer put out of place Oþer out of regne him for to chace. Þe kyng of þis he herde him spelle, Into diuerse thoghtes he felle. He reuertede gretelie in thoght Qweþer it might be so oþer noght. He helde oswin so treu a knight, And wele he kneu he wald bot right. Of þis mare of þe soth to here He calde his maste familiere Princes and dukes and ek barons Þat wiseste wer of þe britons. He bade þai suld spek þam amidde Of slik treson if it wer kidde, In þar skilles to caste and ame Anens oswin of slik defame, Qwat in hert ilkeman vnderstandes, Qwat es to do of slik tiþandes. And amanges þam, lo, alle þai keste Of þis tiþandes how wald be beste. Þai schewed amanges þam many þinges, Bot nane for oþer til essu þas bringes. Sum fand oswin was gode and treu, Sum he might be traitor of neu. Peanda kyng of mecheri Was sclane and scomfet her sothly.

To godemen worthede þis childre fife, Worthie [and] digne and of saint life: Bose in rome deceste in eelde; Cedde he restes in lichefelde; Osteforde in wictmor he laie; And iohan restes in beuerlaie; Wilfride in ripon þai delfe: Alle in wirschipe of godde him selfe.

Þe image þat contende his cors Þai sette it on þis brasen hors; Þe image armede semelie and fair Þai raisede in sight vp in þe har. At london obouen þe yiates weste Þar on to stande þai it adreste, ffor he was kyng so forth worthie, In signe of alle his victorie; Þai raised [it] þar, so þe storis mons, In flaiying of alle þe saxons, Alle þe saxons to flai and dere Þat durande within britaine were. And vnderneth certes þai dide wirk In honur of saint mar[t]in a kirk. And quen þe kirk was edifide, To þe warldes ende als fra þat tide Þai ordainde godde seruis be done ffor þe kynge saule cadwalone And for þe saules to vnderstande Þat sustens þe right in þe lande.

Þan in englande floriste saint bede, So honurable man and saint of lede, So noble clerk of hali scripture; Þar to halelie he gaf his cur. Qwen þe sight failde to his profite, He might no? se langre to write, So of bede written in bokes we finde Goddes wordes to preche he trauaild blind. We finde he prechede goddes lare; He wende gret folk bifor him ware In a dale, no? þar bot ruth stanes; His man in scornyng for þe nanes Said him grete pople es gadred here, And þai abide goddes wordes to lere. Goddes wordes he schewed with his muth With fulgode wile, so he wele cuth. Qwen he made his conclusion, So at ending prechours er won, Alle þe stanes on euerilke side With loude voice als semede þai criede, So men sulde done to sarmun gader, Þai saide: “amen, honurable fader.” Bose primat of eborwikes see Of þis lyfe þan ceste he In þe date of incarnacion Of our lorde iesum goddeson Sex vndre? yiere four score and aght.

Conuerte was her soth saxone And þe kynges landes of fresie. In Wilfrides daies discorde was sene Rise him and kyng alfride bituene. So wilfride for sum þinges in dout Of þe archebischoperik was loched out Þoru þis alfride, þe same king, Enticede againes him for sum þing. And oþer to þe dignite war calde: Saxulfe sacrede and erconwalde. Wilfride tok schipe on cees flodde; Þe rude windes bleu againes him stodde. In to freselande þe winde him bleu Amanges folk he neuer sagh ne kneu. Qwen þai sagh astrange man was he, Þai him resaiuede with willes fre. Of iesum criste, lo, he þam prechede, And þe right troght to þam he teched. He schewede þam þe waies right. Þar kyng forso? aldegise he hight. Of wilfride he name cristendum, So dide alle oþer þat with him cum. He baptisede folk of his landes Withouten numbre fele thousandes. And siþen he paste þeþen to rome, Þar proued treu þoru papedome. Prouede was þat ilke worde þai lighiede Þat him vnto þe cure had wreghiede; Þar was he prouede and fonden slik Worthie to yieme þe bischoprik. Wilfride fra þat he come againe In to þe contres of britaine, He preched þoru suthsex contres Qwar yitte þe folk vncristend he ses. To iesum criste he þam conuertes, And to þe trogh he turnes þar hertes. Sua his duelling it durede lang stunde In diuerse stedes to þe yere secunde Of alfrid, kyng alfrides son, Þat of northumbre had þe coron. Lo, in þar concile sinodale And þoru þar aller assent so hale Iohan was translatede to eborwik To gouern þe archebischoprik, Þe dignite for to gouerne And alle þe pople to lede and lerne. And in þat dignite he stode, To thre and tuenti yiers oueryiode; Sua four and thritti yier welner Bischope he was goddesfolk to ler. In þe date of criste paste Iohan Seuen vndre? yier tuenti and an. Wilfrid escoldesham he tok, His forme see to gouern and lok, And he [it] helde durande his life Sumquile in pes, sumquile in strife, Sumtides out put, þe so? to saine; Þoru right dome he recouerd a gaine. Bischope he was in anguises sere Þe space of fife and fourtie yiere. And so in gode pes at þe laste Winlie out of þis warld he paste After ser trauails he dreghien Of criste seuen vndre? yiers and nieghien. Cadwaladre in firste beginnyng Manlie he fore and regned als kyng, And fra þe tuelfe yier war gan Þat he þe diademe hade tan, He fel in to sekenesse fulstrang, Þe qwilk sekenesse him held fullang. Iquils kindelede discorde ciuile Amanges britons þoru out þe hile. Cadwaladre was seke and vnfer He might þam noþer stem ne ster. His modre was peandas sister, Of englisse blode þe britons wist her. Comen scho was of þe beste kinde Of englisse in westesex to finde; His fader þe kyng cadwalon, Þat of alle britaine bare coron. Qwen he acorded with peandas, Slik fai? bituen þam was, His sister he tok vnto his wife, With her in sposage lede his life. He wedded her and so in þatte Cadwaladre on her he gatte. Alle þe britons þai kneu fulwele He was of englisse blode sumdele. Þerfor of him nane agh þai stode, Ilkeman in þar awne willes yiode. Ilkeman oþer so derde and noiede; Þe plentiuose hile þai destroiede. Slik discorde amanges þe britons, Welner nan of þam in pes wons. Þe kyng þar of he was anguiste, Bot in sekenes so he languiste, Þat he might no? þam adresse; Suffre of him þai walde nadestresse. Ilkan on oþer with ille þai soght, And of þar kyng þai gaf right noght. Þai durede so forth euer mar and mar Qwils kyng languiste so seke and sare.

Welner nane lefte, bot alle paste ouer. Lo, vngre made þar hertes to talme, And oneu opon so on comand qwalme, Þat faste opon þe vngre ensude, Of folk slane fulgret multitude Þai diede so thik þe folk amange, Þe corses fele on þe grunde so thrange, To fone men lefte on lifes quik To delfe þe corses, þat laie so thik. Þan þe waful folk þat þar lefte Of þat slik qwalme þar lifes refte In companies þe hile þai fledde Ouer cee to sek þam woni[n]gstedde. In to quat stedes so þai þam turnede, Sorow þai made and gretelie murnede, Qwar so þat caitife folk to comes To aerde in oþer strange kyngdomes. On þis maner, lo, þam amang Þai saide and sorowfullie þai sang: “Lorde, in þis warlde quiles we lifen Als drape schepe þou hafes vs gifen, Þou hafes vs scaterede her and þor, Amanges sere folk we ne wate qware”. Kyng cadwaladre þis cas bihelde Welner alle diede in contres duelde, Sen godde opon his folk tok wrek, Againes qwas wille was no? to spek. He sagh morine of folk so grefe, So fele within schort tide and brefe Amanges folk fel doune and diede, Alle folk for sorow yielde and criede, On molde þar laie so many dede lik, Gret dole to se þe vengeance slik. He sagh it might na better be, He hiede him out of lande to fle. Þe folk þat he might safe he calde, And in to amorik he walde. He gatte him aful wrechede nauie, To cee he went with sorowful crie. With weping and with sorowful mode He sang þis wordes on þe cees flode: “To vs sinful es sorow and wa, Godde takes on vs vengeance fulthra. To vs es dole, wa, and vnhele ffor our sinnes, þat er so fele. Waful murning it es til vs, On qwam gret godde he wrek him þus. Durande our wele we walde no? blin Liking to haf in alkins sin. Our sinnes certes we walde no? leue Anens godde, þat wer so greue. Lang space we had so wele to do, Bot we walde neuer enclin þarto. Space we had our sinnes to fle, Bot of trespas neuer cessede we. Þerfor on vs now tides þis chance, Sen he on vs now takes vengeance; Sen to his willes we wald no? stande, He puttes vs now out of our lande. He castes vs now out of our hile, ffor euer to life als in exile. His grete pouste, þat euer lastes, Out of our aerde it now vs castes, Vs, quilk neuer yitte þe romains, Þat ofte siþes faght vs agains, Ne ek scotes, ne ek pecthes— Þai faght on vs in manykins sleghtes— Out of our erde neuer þai us drafe, Þis hile fra vs to win and hafe. Ne vs out drafe neuer þe saxons, Þat dide vs so fele fals tresons, Þof þai ful ofte put vs to dout And welner clenelie hade vs out. Euer on þam recouerde we bigan And our contres certes agane wan. Sen it was no? goddes wille Þat we þar in sulde regne stille, ffor our trespas we haf done ar He put vs out for euer mar. Lo, alle our pride and wok es felde; Lo, alle our lande baraine and gelde; Morine ouer gane our fe and store, And alle for our trespas bifore. Verai iuge he es and suthfaste; He suffres vs and ses at þe laste Þat of our sinnes we wil no? ces, Anens him selfe halde vs in pes. He wille þat nane erdelik man maie Of our contres put vs awaie, Bot anelie he, þat alle adresses; ffle propre aerde, lo, he vs stresses. Now thralie he chastes vs foles And puttes vs doune of our stoles. Yia, he þat es of might so grete Now he vs castes out of our sete. We leue our awne nacion, Til strange landes we seke to won. Lo, now out of our aerde we lepe; A gaines godde es now to threpe. Comes now againe, alle yie romains! Now finde yie naman yow agains. Comes againe, yie scote and pecthes! ffor agains yow naman fightes. Comes againe, alle yie saxons! Now in britaine, lo, naman wons. Lo, alle britaine þis daies now Es made desert and opon to yow. Lo, alle britaine, quilk yie desire, Es made deserte þoru goddes ire, Op[o]n qwilk hile yie ofte haf foghten; Mak it desert neuer yie moghten, Þoru stren? certes put vs no? out, Þof yie lang tides haf bene about, Bot his pouste, þe so? to saine, Þat regnes on hegh, kyng soueraine, Qwam we to wreth wald neuer drede; Now he him wrekes on vs in dede. Out of our aerde, lo, he vs drifes, Þar for euer mare he vs prifes.” Sorowe and site was þam þan By alle þe contres of brittan. Kyng cadwaladre, doleful to her, Spak þas wordes with sorowful cher, Quile he him oþer recette sekes; Þe teres ran doune bi his chekes. Sughande he murnede and sare he wepe; Alle might haf dole til him to kepe. With open sorow his handes he wrange. Þis wordes he criede þam alle amange: “Qwat erdelik man mai solace tak Againe quam godd wil partie mak? Qwat man in erde es so mightie Againes godde mai mak partie? Qwat man mai sai his hert lightes Agains quam godde selfe he fightes? In his mercie, þis es my bone, Of vs in alle in his wille be done.” Quiles he was in slik descomforte, He arifede in amorikes porte. His nauie þar come to þe lande; Recette amanges þat folk he fande. He come with his gret multitude, Þat out of britaine him ensude, To kyng alane, þat was so fre; Kyng salamones newoi was he. And fulhonurable þat tim He and þai wer resaiuede of him. Britaine was þan alle voide and waste Of alkins citisains almaste, Out tane a fone of þam þat darde Within wales qware dede þam sparde. Þis vngre and qualme, griseli to neuen, It dured þe space of yieres elleuen. Saxons, þat wer in þe contres, Sum wandrede in wath, sum awai fles; Ilke man lifede with fodes sere, Sum with purchas of þe wilde dere, And sum with rotes als wilde swine, And sum þar lifede with saluagene, And sum þat cuth þai lifede þat quile With water fische and volatile. Qwalme stode anelie to þe britons And vngre to alle oþer nacions. Lo, after nighien yiers at þe laste, Qwen alle pestilens was paste, Saxons within britaine tapiste Bihelde þe schenschepe euua[n]iste, Qwalme and vngre in þe hile it ceste, And alkins maner frutes encreste; Þe molde þai put in til? fulsone, So þai bifor wer won to done; And in to germanie þai sent Vnto þar fers þat þider went. Þai bade þam cum til þam againe In to þe landes of britaine; Þai bade þam hasteli repair— ffor frutes þar in florisses so fair— Bring al with þam þar nacion, Þat hafes in wille in welth to won. ffor inborn folk þe hile it tharnes, Naman lefte þat þam entre warnes.

Þe angel warned cadwalader, Bad hym to england neuer repaer. Qwen þis was schewede to þam þat tide, Samen gadrede þat pople weride Withouten numbre gret multitude Of saxons folk so proude and rude; Men and women withouten numbre Alle þai applide of northside humbre.

Naman þai fande in gode ne ille Þat walde þan againe sai þar wille, Ne þat þam wilde mak defens To welde alle þai fande in presens Bot of britons an fone poueraile, Þat ouer lifede als þar rascaile, Þat in wudes and rugh rochins Tok þar reste and in wastins, Þat duelde als in gannokes and vales Within wastins and wudes of wales. ffra þat tim þe britons pouste It ceste within britaine to se. And englis men bigan þase daies Þe landes in to þar handes to sais, Þar kynges for to tak diademe, Principalie þe regne to yieme. And efterwarde ouer paste sumtide Þat contres wer reedifide, Anens til? raisede many aplogh, Þe lande plentiuouse anogh, And alle pople strenghede sumdele, Gode pes bigan and folk fore wele. Kyng cadwaladre þis vnderstode Britaine was plentiuouse and gode And þat of qwalme and vngre so strang, Þat durede in þe hile so lang, It was clensede and purifide, And frutes þar in wer multiplide. Þar to in wille he thoght to cum, Againe to resaife his kingdum. Helpe he haskede of kyng alaine Into his regne bring him againe And him þase daies for to restore, Þe regne to haf was his bifore; His bifor dignite to vse He walde it no? so light refuse. Qwen him grantede alaine þe kyng Him to regne againe to bring And he bigan to apparaile Nauie in to britaine to saile, Til him a voice sounede fra heuen, Als it wer in an angel steuen: He bade him ces and think namar In to britaine againe to fair. He bade him leue he hade bigonen; Oþer nacion his regne hade wonen. ffor goddes wille es nalangre quile Britons within britaines hile Þai salle regne, ne ek haf coron, So þai bifor þar in wer won, Vnto þat ilke tide comen war Þat merlin spak of in his lare And arthur schewede in prophecie; Slik es þe wille of godde mightie. And yitte ek he comandede him Þat he sulde wende to rome þat tim And vnto sergius þe pape Scheu alle his life als wise and yiape, Þar his penance for to fulfille Durande his daies in goddes wille, Numbrede to be for ane of hise Amanges þe saintes of heuenrik blise.

And ek þat tim cum salle it noght Til relikes againe be broght, Til þe britons gete his relikes And bring in to þar kyngrikes. And qwen þat þai er broght againe To within þe regne of britaine, Þe relikes salle be schewed þen Of oþer saintes and holymen. His relikes siþen þoru pople paigiene Er hidde and felde, neuer to be sene; Sua þe britons for euer sulde stint Recouer relikes so loste and tint. Cadwalader was last kyng of brittons, Endyd his life within rome wones. Cadwaladre herde þis with his hers Schewed him þoru diuine messangers. Alsone to kyng alaine he went, He talde ilke worde in his present Þat þan was schewede him vnto, Haskede him consaile qwat was to do. Þan kyng alaine tok diuerse bokes In qwilk of prophecies men lokes And þe prophecies of aquile, Þat ful certaine was halden þat quile, Þase þat to sextoine was writen, Þe so? þoru prophecie to witen. And to þe dite so ek of sibille He dide wisemen vndo skille, And ek þe bokes of merline, Þoru him vnto þe so? to win. Þe bokes wer redde fra uerse to uerse, Þar prophecies to reherse, To se of cadwaladre schewing To qwat effek þai might it bring, To wite ek if it walde acorde Til written oracle in anykins worde. Þai saide nankins descorde þai fande Anens recouerer of þe lande, Bot euer slik: to britons come, His relikes þai bring fra rome. Kyng alaine bade to cadwaladre Obeis to his celestiene fadre. He bade him in al þinges encline Til dispensacion diuine. He bade him lat britaines hile be, Muse namar of þat dignite, Bot do so he herde godde angelle In his schewing vnto him spelle. Wer it in gode, wer it in ille, He bade [him] stande to goddes wille. Hastile wende forth he sulde assent, So godde him gafe in comandement, And do his wille in alle þinges, “ffor he es king ouer alle kynges. Nane erdelik man withouten him comes In þis warlde to haf kyngdomes; Ne ek to entre þe regne of heuen Withouten his wille thar naman neuen. To do his wille þou hie þe sone; In heuen and erde his wille be done.” He bade him in to britaine sende Iuor his son with þam to lende, Iuor, þat was his son and air, Into britaine for to repair, And hine, his newof, sende alsua Of britons for to gouerne þa Þat in britaine þam now sustens— A[n]eus now comen on þam paigiens— “Þat þar slik franchise aunciene, Þat so lang tides yiemede has bene, ffra our blode be no? tint ne loste, So nedelinges lose it þai moste.” Þa[n] cadwaladre to godde him tok, Alle erdelik þinges sone he forsok. Þe regne to haf withouten ende To rome werde he biginnes to wende. To sergius þe pape come he, Of him confermede for to be. And at þe pape, lo, he was schrifen Of alle þe tides in warlde he lifen, Of him assoilde in alkins þing, Of him resaifede ek his blissing. Qwen clenelie he þan had done þus, Confermede of þe pape sergius, Sodanelie him tok greue langure; He yialde him vnto goddes cure. He paste þis life at þe tuelfte daie ffolghande after þe calende of maie, ffra þe coron he nam in þis warlde her Þe space of foure and tuentie yiere, In þe yiere of incarnacion Of our lorde iesum goddesson Of yieres seuen vndre? and ten, Als þoru acountes of þe wisemen.

Kyng cadwaladre son Iuor, So his fadre him bad bifor, He puruaide him sone of nauie And of alkyns þinges redie. With him was hine his cosin, Adoghti knight, þat walde no? twin. And vnto þam alle þai asoste Þat þai might gete and made an oste. And in to þar nauie þai yiode And paste so ouer þe cees flode. Þai applide in britaines hile And faght þar in durand lang qwile.

And euer tide to þar nacion fferinges dede, so it was won: Vngre, durande tharning of mete, Ek pestilens and qualme so grete And descorde wel gret þoru custum Amanges þam euer redie to cum, Descorde and hate, ba? stille and loude, With helde þat wrechede pople so prude, Þat þai natim might haf grace Þar enemies out of þares to chace.

Alle þase of þam þat paigiens ware Of iesum criste þai herde þe lare, Þai tok baptem and bicom wise, Nane þar to strife on oþer to rise. Pes þai vsede and gode acorde Amanges þam ba? in dede and worde. Þai trauaild yern and tilde þe feldes, Þat large frutes to þam yeldes. Castells þai raisede in þe contres And reedifide þe cites. And anglande þai diuisede in seuen, In seuen ser kyngdomes to neuen. Lordeschape of britons þai forsok, And of þam self a lorde þai tok. fforto mainten þam alle in pes Ane of þam ouer þam alle þai ches.

Of þar lordeschape we spek namar, Bot within wale we suffer þam dar. Of adelstane now fra þis tim And of anglise kinges after him Þat regned in anglande spek we salle, Sen þai haf þe coron principalle.</field>
