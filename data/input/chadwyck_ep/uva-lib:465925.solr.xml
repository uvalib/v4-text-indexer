      <field name="fulltext">The needy Knave is punish'd for his Fau't, And the poor Punk is to Correction brought. The Great sin only at a nobler Price, And, with a richer Mantle, hide their Vice. Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[PART I.] The formal Precisian; OR, The devout Lady. The pious Dame, with formal Face, demure in Speech and Carriage; Altho' she talks so much of Grace, Is not the best for Marriage. For Woman, tho' she's so precise As ne'er to speak a Word ill; Yet her Religion never lies Beneath the Waste or Girdle. What, tho' she prays with holy Friends, And cants against the Devil; Yet saving Grace ne'er condescends To stoop beneath her Navel. Her Petticoats so hard she ties, That Conscience keeps its Station; Nor can what's done below, arise To give it Perturbation. Thus wisely makes Religion know Its Bounds of Ambulation, That Grace above, and Lust below, Have no Communication. So that in Case the Seat of Love, Her Tail, commits a Folly, She thinks her Mind, that dwells above, Is ne'er a Jot less holy. Or else her Tongue could never cant Of Grace with gifted Brother, And act the Part of pious Saint, Whilst Buttocks play another. Fond Youth, beware how you pursue The Lass demurely sober, The Saint would vanish soon, could you Of holy Cheats disrobe her. The pious Dame may plague your Head; Such Roses have their Prickles: And Punks and Jilts are often bred In holy Conventicles. The Female Student; OR, The Learned Lady. Unhappy he that's doom'd to wear The Matrimonial Collar, With her who is not only fair, But fancies she's a Schollar. Puff'd up with Pride and vain Conceit, She'll soar above her Station, And think she has, by Dint of Wit, The Right of Domination. What, tho' she scolds in French or Dutch, Or chatters in the Roman, One Tongue is always found too much For a contentious Woman. If with more Languages she's hung, Than taught her by her Mother, Whene'er you bid her hold one Tongue, She'll plague you with another. Therefore let none select a Wife, For having sundry Speeches; The more she has, the greater Strife Will rise about the Breeches. Nor let the youthful Novice chuse A Woman for her Learning; For Wives turn greater Jilts or Shrews, The more they are discerning. Therefore, I say, beware, my Friend, Of learned Dame or Gammar, Who will with Tongue and Broom, contend About the Rules of Grammar. The prattling Shrew, in Spite of Art, Will prove a head-strong Creature; And thro' her cursed Pride, invert The very Laws of Nature. She muses as she uses: OR, The Censorious Lady. Of all the jealous Female-Race, No Dame is so censorious As she, who tho' she shuns Disgrace, Deserves to be notorious. For as she sins without the Shame, And saves her Reputation, She thinks all Women do the same, Tho' free from Defamation. Meeting with neither Child or Clap, All single Dames and Widows She fancies by some Art escape The same, yet kiss as she does. You therefore, who had rather wed, Than live at large, and wander, Ne'er join the Dame in Marriage-Bed, That's given much to Slander. For she that's forward to distrust, On slender Grounds, another, Has stood Love's penetrating Thrust, As surely as her Mother. She that has broke thro' Vertue's Laws, And no Delight refuses, Will think all others bad, because She muses as she uses. The Mother ne'er had peep'd at Mouth Of th'Oven for her Daughter, Had not the Baker, in her Youth, That Way of hiding taught her. Therefore the Fool, that wou'd be curs'd Above his horned Brothers, Of Plagues I'd have him wed the worst, The Jilt that censures others. The Cunning Wanton: OR, Intriguing Lady. If she that boasts of noble Blood, Of Vertue, and of Honour, Will stray in spite of all that's good, And bring Disgrace upon her: If such, who are so nicely bred, No Patience have to tarry; But will, like German Eagle, spread Their Legs before they marry: Well may young Country Jug and Joan, With Roger take their Freedom, And wanton Damsels, bred in Town, Submit to those that need 'em. If Doll, the Chamber-maid, can find My Lady has her Paces, The Minx will have a longing Mind To yield her own Embraces. No sooner that the Slattern knows Her Lady takes it freely, But John, the Butler, must be chose To be her Cockadilly. If Quality thus run astray, Who practise so much kneeling, And yet as often as they pray, Make Use of Fellow-Feeling: Well may those Dames, who never had Such pious Education, Thro' want of Sense or Grace, run mad For wicked Copulation. Therefore, my Friend, if you'd be free From horned Defamation, Take Care as well of Quality, As those of lower Station. The Countess of Brandipolis: OR, The Toping Lady. Since scornful Dames, of high Renown, Who ride in gilded Coaches, Become the Jests of Court and Town, For their obscene Debauches: Well may Dame Thumbleton excuse The Love she' as for the Pitcher; And needy Whores bred up in Stews, Take Pattern by the Richer. If swelling Honour cannot bind My Ladies, who are Courtiers, From Stygian Drams, at first design'd For Carmen, and for Porters: But Noble Blood must rob the Rogues Of their infernal Liquor, And lofty Ladies have their Cogues To make their Wits the quicker: Who then can blame the Market-Dames, That join their Pence together, And by internal Brandy-Flames, Keep out the frosty Weather? But female Quality, of late, To mend their tallow Faces, Such who of Birth and Vertue prate, Will tope off brimming Glasses. So well the fiery Juice agrees With Woman's colder Nature; 'Twill make the rev'rend Lady kiss As warmly as her Daughter. But if her Honour knows not how To use it as she should do, 'Twill make her drunk as common Sow, And every Jot as lewd too. The Dissatisfy'd Wife: OR, The Jealous Lady. When the brisk Help-Mate does begin To think her Husband slighting, And doubts he plays at in and in With Ladies more inviting. 'Tis Time he either mends his Pace, To prove she is not cheated; Or that he padlocks up the Place, Where Female Honour's seated. Or else, to ease her longing Mind, She'll kiss behind the Curtain; And tho' she seems more fondly kind; Will horn him of a certain. For when young Madam jealous proves, Her Husband may be sure on't, She only hints what 'tis she loves, And that she wou'd have more on't. In Wives, it is a modest Way Of shewing what is wanted, And begging that our Favours may More lib'rally be granted. I'm jealous Husband. Prithee why? Because I'm so neglected. That is, you don't repeat the Joy So often as expected. Not but, perhaps, the Gypsy thinks, That you're a Man full able; But that you kiss some wanton Minx, And misapply your Bauble. No Matter whether false or true, Or brisk as other Fellows, Your Wife believes sh'as not her Due, Or else she'd ne'er be jealous. For Jealousy's the Scum of Lust, That boils above Discretion; And if one won't, another must Appease the frothy Passion. Bad Luck to him that has her. OR, The Gaming Lady. Woman, when any Vice sh'as chose, Whate'er the Devil ails her, The evil Habit ne'er can lose, 'Till Purse or Beauty fails her. If am'rous Sporting be her Game, But trust her o'er the Gruncel, And 'till she's old she'll hunt the same, In Spite of all good Counsel. If Drinking be her chosen Vice, Ev'n Age will not reform her; But still she'll drink whilst she can piss, To keep her Clay the warmer. If Gaming be your Wife's Delight, She'll grow but worse upon ye, And still play on, until her Sight Does fail her, or her Money. Therefore e'en let her chafe and scold, But keep her from your Britches; Or else she'll game away your Gold, And soon exhaust your Riches. Nor should you fear to be undone By what she loses barely; For Women have more Games than one, Who love the Cards so dearly. If Fortune, in a moody Vein, Should chance to hardly use her, The Winner, if a handsom Man, Must always kiss the Loser. Thus Gaming very oft does prove A Bawd to that which worse is, And causes base adult'rous Love, As well as empty Purses. Female Secresy: OR, The Prying Lady. She that unlocks her Husband's Breast, By fondling and indulging, Dives only that her Tongue may taste The Pleasure of divulging. For what her Kisses gain o'er Night, Next Day she must discover, And, with a cautious Hint, recite The pleasing Secret over. If bawdy, then her neighb'ring Dame Receives the Jest with Laughter, And wonders how my Lady came Thus privy to the Matter. If weighty, then amaz'd she stands, Tho' with the News delighted; And lifting up her Eyes and Hands, Cries, Madam, I am frighted. Thus 'tis from one to one reveal'd, Tho' 'twas to go no further; 'Till what each vow'd should be conceal'd, Be publish'd, tho' it's Murder. Fine Ladies, well as tatling Drabs, Conform to Female Custom; For Heav'n has made all Women Blabs, To warn us how we trust 'em. The Widow's Lawyer, in his Wine, As he a Bond was making, With Know one Woman, did begin, The common Form mistaking. Says she, O! fie, your Bond is lame, It should have been All Men, Sir. With that he looks upon the Dame, And makes this witty Answer. Says he, I've made it right and Just; For if one Woman knows it, 'Tis very plain, that all Men must, For she will soon disclose it. From the Spinning-Wheel, to the Coach: OR, Golden Joan made his Worship's Lady. The 'Squire that leads a rural Life Among his Hounds and Horses, And takes a Country Joan to Wife, To join their wealthy Purses; Had best be careful how he brings Her rosy Cheeks to London, Lest, by fine Men, and pretty Things, The giddy Fool be undone. For Madam will the Spark admire, Whose Gallantry's exceeding, And quit her surly Country 'Squire, For Beau of nicer Breeding. He's wise, that thinks his Wife is true To Vertue, and to Honour; But he's the wiser of the two, That keeps an Eye upon her. Convenient Time, and proper Place, With him that knows to flatter, In Spite of Modesty and Grace, Will cause her Chaps to water. For holy Wedlock's but a Kind Of lawful Obligation, That is not strong enough to bind A Woman's Inclination. When lovely Objects do appear, Their fickle Hearts will wander; And as Temptation draws more near, Forget the Vows they're under. Therefore, since Wives, altho' debarr'd By Wedlock, yet will do it; Let's be our selves their Vertue's Guard, But never let 'em know it. High Birth, but no Fortune: OR, The Depending Lady. If highly bred, tho' at others Cost, How Madam makes a Pudder, Altho' she nothing has to boast, Besides her Tongue and Udder: This is not good enough to wear, Nor that to please her Palate, Altho' her Fortune is so bare, She scarce deserves a Vallet. Yet, highly born, she hopes at least To be my Lady Kath'rine, Tho' the proud taudry Flirt, at best, Is but a worthless Slattern. What, tho' she young and airy be, And has her Share of Beauty, She's born with too much Quality, In Wedlock to be true t'ye. Th'ambitious Madam seldom loves The Blockhead that she marries; And tho' with Child she never proves, She very oft miscarries. For Beauty, who can boast no Gold, Seeks out for some rich Tony; The gouty Fool that's lame and old, May buy her with his Money. But when he'as done, not all his Wealth Will to his Bed secure her; She'll have a handsom Spark, by Stealth, To do her Business for her. Like Flies about a Honey-pot, The Beaus will flock about her, And quickly make him curse his Lot, And wish himself without her. The Fashionable Bawd: OR, The Lady's Confident. When Lust inflames a Woman's Breast, And fires her Inclination, She's not alone content to taste The Sweets of Generation. But when she'as oft the Bliss enjoy'd, A farther Itch arises, And makes her fond to be employ'd In others secret Vices: For she that once has taken Man, Hates Lovers should be idle, And is for chaining all she can, Like Monkeys, by the Middle: Judging, by'rself, the Brisk and Blith Are all inclin'd, by Nature, To have a Fellow-feelling with Their amorous Fellow-Creature. She smiles to hear my Lady cant Of Honour so precisely, And thinks she ploughs with some Gallant, But that she does it wisely: Well knowing 'tis a common Blind, For Women to be railing Against that pleasing Sin, they find To be the most prevailing. Therefore, the humble Punk is proud To see her lofty Betters, Who talk so much of being good, As bad as other Creatures: Turns Bawd and Pimp, that she may tell Convincing pretty Stories, To prove her Grace-Intrigues, as well As Phillis, or as Chloris. The Great Man's Prostitute: OR, The Original of an Actress taken into Keeping. When Beauty does adorn the Lass In poor dejected Station, 'Tis seldom 'company'd with Grace, For want of Education. Tho' Nature has been greatly kind, And all her Pow'r exerted, Yet, where there wants a vertuous Mind, Those Blessings are perverted. The Son, by an ill Father bred, One copies from the other; Nor will fair Looks preserve the Maid From proving like her Mother. And he that's am'rously inclin'd T'ingross the fickle Creature, Will find no Love or Gold will bind The Baseness of her Nature. She's mix'd with such a course Allay, That Art can ne'er refine her, And thinks 'tis witty to betray The Fool that glories in her: For who can be accounted wise, Tho' ne'er so rich and noble, That's drawn by such a Harlot's Eyes, To be a Keeping-Bubble? If Men of Honour must be lewd, And will be Womens Cullies, Let 'em not mix their noble Blood With Scoundrels bred in Alleys; But, with young City Dames, engage The Spawn of broken Mayors, And not corrupt the Royal Stage To th'Scandal of the Players. Miss Buxom: OR, The Golden-lock'd Lady unmarry'd. 'Tis not ill Company alone That draws us into Evil, Some are to Vice by Nature prone, Untempted by the Devil. Some Female Looks too plainly shew A whorish Inclination, Nor can they hide it from our View, By vertuous Education: Their Eyes, the Index of the Mind, Will still disclose their Failing, And shew to all that are not blind, How Nature is prevailing. The Phisnomist the Signs of Grace, In vertuous Look discovers The Gallows in a Villain's Face, And Leach'ry in a Lover's. So does the sanguine Lass denote Her Lust by her Complexion, And that she's rank as Stable-Goat, And full of fond Affection. From Stars, Astrologers aver We draw our Inclinations, And that all Women subject are To sublunar Mutations. If Stars have such a fatal Pow'r On those, who are so naught here, Then Venus is a greater Whore, Than ever yet I thought her: She's painted too with Golden-Hair Dishrevil'd down her Boddice, To shew most yellow Ladies are As lustful as their Goddess. Modern Quality: OR, The Upstart Lady. Honour, the Just should only bear, Tho' Knaves and Harlots court it; And ought not to be plac'd, but where There's Merit to support it. 'Twas not design'd for Dames to wear, Bred to the Pot and Ladle; The Hog or Sow, tho' fat and fair, Will ill become a Saddle. Honour should drop, when Vertue fails, And cease when we misuse it; Not be so fix'd to Ladies Tails, That do so oft abuse it. Then might the Danger of Disgrace Make sinful Pleasures hated, And padlock up that slip'ry Place, Wher Female Honour's seated. Proud Ladies then might vertuous prove, To keep their lofty Titles, And not persue what now they love Much better than their Victuals. But what great Dame will want her Fill Of Pleasures that she prizes, When Ladies shall be honour'd still, In Spight of all their Vices? Since Fortunes are such Jilts and Shrews, Whom Friends bestow much Cost on, And prove as bad, or worse, than those, Who have no Bags to boast on. I'll praise the Dame with Vertue blest, Altho' her Fortune's little, Who wears her Honour in her Breast, And not in empty Title. The Hospitable House-keeper: OR, The Bountiful Lady. My Lady's Honour, if she's lewd, Is but an airy Bubble; 'Tis Vertue, not her boasted Blood, That makes a Woman noble. A wanton Harlot we have seen Advanc'd to be a Dutchess; And many a lustful Persian Queen Were subject to Debauches. Therefore, since Lady-Punks, we find In ev'ry lofty Station; None but the chast and noble Mind, Deserves our Admiration. For what vain Mortal would regard My Lady's boasted Honour, When fifty more, besides my L?, Her Woman swears, have known her? Yet Poets make such now-a-days, As chast as bright Diana; But I'd as soon bestow my Praise On lustful Messilana. Man may commend a Common-Shore, That every Scoundrel uses; But still a Whore will be a Whore, In Spite of all the Muses. Therefore, were I to shew my Skill, I'd praise my good old Countess; And in the smoothest Numbers, tell Her Vertues, and her Bounties. The Graces of her noble Mind, Would be a Theme uncommon; But who, among the Sex, can find So excellent a Woman? The End of the first Part.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II. The Modish Gentleman: OR, The Climbing Courtier. Ne'er think it strange, that Knaves should rise, Whilst honest Men are laid by; There's something that in private lies, Which many a Man is made by. Some climb aloft, to little born, But let it be no Wonder; Perhaps he has the Luck to turn Some pow'rful Lady under. Stage-Harlots we have often seen Advanc'd to lofty Station, And coach'd in State, like Madam Gwin, To th'Scandal of the Nation. Young cunning Jilts, we daily see, Are kept in State by N?s, And make those Men of high Degree, Right honourable Bubbles. Why therefore mayn't Sir Foplin rise By Flatt'ries and Indearments, And pass between a Lady's Thighs, To very great Preferments? For Women that admire the Sport, Will have their Sparks to ease 'em; And will do any Kindness for't, To Fav'rites that can please 'em. Ladies, who high and stately are, May talk of being vertuous; But Honour will not guard the Fair, From being kind and courteous. Therefore, the fawning Beau-Gallant, That can with Flatt'ries tongue 'em, If he's but wise, need nothing want, That gets but in among 'em. The Corrupt Statesman: OR, The Compleat Courtier. Ambition is a noble Spur, And the sublimest Passion; It makes the Hero fly to War, In Hopes to raise his Station. Th'aspiring Soul no Rest can find, Ambition rides upon her; And still provokes the gen'rous Mind To soar in Search of Honour. But Knaves, who by ignoble Ways Shall hunt the Game that's noble, And grow most infamously base, To give their Country Trouble; Are spurr'd by Av'rice, Pride, Revenge, Such diabolick Passions, To ruin Kingdoms, and unhinge The Government of Nations. Such trayt'rous Sycophants profane True Honour and Ambition, In trampling over worthy'r Men, To mend their own Condition. For he who does true Honour seek, Is careful to maintain it, And cannot do a shameful Trick, Or cruel Deed, to gain it. The Fool that does, must lose his End, And be but Honour's Bubble; For how can what's ignoble tend, To make a Knave more noble? Climb as you can, but Spite of Pride, Be just in e'ery Station; For none but Villains e'er comply'd To sell their King or Nation. The Trimming Guide: OR, The Avaritious Priest. When Avarice, that evil Root, I'th' Heart of Man is planted, No Riches will content the Brute, For more will still be wanted. But when 'tis rooted in a Priest, 'Tis worse than in a Lay-man; He'll turn for Int'rest East or West, And never be the same Man. Who would on such a Guide depend, For Heavenly Instruction, Who, to obtain his wealthy End, Would side with any Faction? Expose his holy Mother, which He should defend from Evil; And would, no Doubt, to grow more rich, Turn Vicar to the Devil? Well may the Flock their Bounds mistake, When Shepherds that command 'em, For Int'rest Sake the Fences break, To let 'em run at Random. If the poor Sheep must punish'd be, For straying God knows whither, The Pastor cannot sure go free, That drives or leads 'em thither. He that presumes to be a Guide, Ought well to know his Duty, And, if he sees you step aside, To instruct ye, and confute ye. But Guides, that from Religion rove, And on its Precepts trample, Deserve some Judgment from above, To make them an Example. The Beau-Officer: OR, The Coward in Commission. True Fortitude in Poor or Rich, Is such a graceful Talent, That ev'ry Coward has an Itch To be accounted valiant. Some cheat the World with Soldiers Cloths, And strut in Red, like Heroes, When they've scarce Courage to oppose An Army of Cock-Sparrows. Others in Publick fight Sham-Duels, On Purpose to be parted, And bully poor submissive Fools, They know to be faint-hearted. Or else in Play-house, at a Night, Contend about their Doxies, And draw their hurtless Blades, to fright The Ladies in the Boxes: Who squeak, that Men with brandish'd Swords Should prove so rash and silly, When they themselves, with fewer Words, Would stand a Thrust more freely. Thus Dastards many Ways contrive To seem robust and froward, And oft, against their Nature, strive To shun the Name of Coward. Yet ev'ry Man, we plainly see, Is fearful of his Brother; Or why should one desire to be Thought braver than another? Therefore, since Courage is a Name, That most Men do delight in, The Scarlet Beau we must condemn, That is avers'd to fighting. The Ambitious Mercenary: OR, The Climbing Lawyer, The Law's a Labyrinth, that tries The Patience of the Student, Who knows it must be reckon'd wise, Who shuns it, full as prudent. It is so deep, so wide, so vast, So powerful and commanding, That, like God's Grace, 'tis almost past All human Understanding. Of subtle Snares and Traps, 'tis full, To catch unwary Fools in; And has more cunning Paths, than all The Kingdom that it rules in. It makes the surly Clowns and Swains Pay Homage to their Betters; And binds the Rich with little Chains, But loads the Poor with Fetters. It does the money'd Miser Right Against his helpless Neighbour; It gratifies the Great Man's Spite, And makes the Needy labour. It measures out the Bounds of Kings, And keeps the Subject humble; Who otherwise, at little Things, Would be too apt to grumble. The Law it self is truly good; Men would without be Devils; But when not practis'd as it should, It proves the worst of Evils. Therefore, the Man, who, for a Fee Or Bribe, shall misapply it, In common Justice ought to be Severely punish'd by it. The Prodigal Upstart: OR, The Citizen turn'd Gentleman. Could the rich Miser but foresee How all h' as basely gotten, By his proud Heir will lavish'd be, When he is dead and rotten; Sure he would never be that Fool, To toil away his Vigour, Or cheat the World, and damn his Soul, To live a wealthy Beggar! No mouldy Fragment would he eat, And punish craving Nature, To make his Hoards the more compleat For others that come a'ter; But on expensive Dainties dine, Enrich'd with noble Sauces, And in salubrious Bowls of Wine Drown all his Cares and Crosses: Live well on Earth, no Pleasures spare, When Inclination offers; And ne'er be damn'd, to give an Heir The emptying of his Coffers. For who would toil to fill his Bags, And trot with Bond and Tally, For nothing but unwholsome Rags, To hide an empty Belly? Such covetous unthinking Slaves, Are doubly damn'd, most surely, For getting Money first like Knaves, And next for living poorly; That Spend-Thrifts, govern'd by no Rules, When they are dead, may have it To fling away as much like Fools, As sordid Misers save it. The Severe Magistrate: OR, The Proud Man in Authority. Should the great Ruler of the Whole, Look down on human Nature, With the same Scorn the haughty Soul Beholds his Fellow-Creature, The Proud would dread those Ills they do To their inferior Brothers, Should Heav'n no other Mercy shew To them, than they to others. With what strange Insolence can Man Expect to be forgiven, Who proves as cruel as he can To all the Sons of Heav'n? Envy, Severity, and Pride, Are Qualities so evil In Magistrates, that they're ally'd To Witchcraft and the Devil. Mildness and Mercy, ought to be The gentle Gifts and Graces Of Persons in Authority, Who sit in lofty Places. 'Tis true, the awful Brow, we find, Becomes a pow'rful Station; But let the Heart be still inclin'd To Mercy and Compassion. The Sword of Justice cuts too keen, If us'd with Heat and Passion; It therefore should be lay'd on Men With Christian Moderation. The Wise, the Merciful, and Just, Who've Consciences to bind 'em, Are only fit for publick Trust: But who knows where to find 'em? Riches acquir'd before Discretion: OR, The young Extravagant Heir just come to an Estate. Av'ritious Age, or vicious Youth, I know not which are wiser, Since Riches are a Curse to both The Spend-thrift and the Miser. The Rake that's govern'd by no Rule, Has too much Wealth, if any, Because he spends it like a Fool, Whilst he commands a Penny. The Covetous, tho' rich in Store, With Bars and Locks abuse it; And in the mid'st of Wealth, are poor, Because they fear to use it. Thus one is with his Riches curs'd, Because no Rules will bind him; The other 'cause he starves, 'till forc'd To leave his Wealth behind him. Both are made wretched by Extreams; One spends without reserving; Whilst t'other's plagu'd with restless Dreams Of Robbers, and of starving. But he that's vicious and profuse, Is thought to be the better, Because the Publick have the Use Of what such Block-heads scatter: Whilst he that doats upon his Pelf, Does such an Idol make on't, He'll neither use his Gold himself, Nor let the World partake on't. Therefore, since both deserv'dly fall Beneath our Condemnation, Be not too close, or prodigal, But spend with Moderation. The States-man's Minion: OR, The Politick Understrapper. Whoever hopes to rise aloft Beneath a tow'ring Master, Must think, in Spite of all his Craft, To struggle with Disaster. Minions are necessary Tools To cunning Politicians; And prove of Use, like knavish Fools, To travelling Physicians. What, tho' he's able to advise, When e'er his Lord shall need it? In all Things, where the Man proves wise, The Master has the Credit. But if my Lord mistakes his Aim, And in his Project fumbles, His Minion then must bear the Blame, When e'er his Lordship stumbles. So Madam, when a Trump is fled, A modest Look will put on, And charge the Fault upon her Maid, Or else her Lap-dog Button. Great Quality must have their Skreens, To blind a foolish Nation; Or else their Faults, like other Men's, Would soon have Publication. But they have twenty subtil Ways, To hide their sully'd Honour; Five Guineas to our Poet Bays, Will make him praise the Donor. The Great, in short, disdain all Rules, To steer by Inclination; And must have fawning Knaves and Fools, To save their Reputation. The Promissory Gentleman: OR, The Fashionable Friend. Friendship, so much by Sots profess'd, When o'er the merry Bottle, Like Woman's Vertue, is at best No more than Tittle Twattle. The Courtier vows he'll be your Friend, And pawns his Life upon it; Yet will not merit, in the End, The waving of your Bonnet. The boon Companion, o'er his Wine, Will promise to befriend you; But when he finds you're bare of Coin, The Dev'l a Sous he'll lend you. Your Bosom-Lady now so kind, Who swears she doats upon you, Will fail you, if she once can find You stand in need of Money. Your very Brother will dispense With all the Ties of Nature, And take it for a great Offence, You should become his Debtor. The Friend that you esteem the best, And think the most deserving, Should you by Fate be once depress'd, He'd shun you when you're starving. But say, there is a Friend, and you've The lucky Wit to chuse him; Unless you can requite his Love, You'll very quickly lose him. For Friendship never long can thrive, Whilst Int'rest is its Mother; But soon must die, since all Men strive To bubble one another. The Temporizing Zealot: OR, The Religious Mammonist. We rave against the Whore of Rome; But let our own Religion, To th'Scandal of our Church, become The Villain's Enchiridion. 'Tis the Knave's Handle to each Fraud, By which he wrongs his Neighbours: Each Robber too, implores his God To bless his wicked Labours. The very Bawd, that odious Beast, The worst of Female Creatures, I'th' Church must twice a-day, at least, Expose her wither'd Features. She vainly strives to hide her Crimes With a religious Vizard, Altho' the Sow is fifty Times More wicked than a Wizard. The very Dame that lives by Love, And by her Buttock's Motion, In Publick will dishonour Jove With outward sham-Devotion: She too has learn'd the pious Way, Like wanton holy Sister, To blush and sin; then cry and pray, As soon as Man has kiss'd her. The Trader to his Interest bends The Faith, that he inclines to, And serves the Lord for private Ends; And so do some Divines too. Vertue, in short, is so much sunk, That by the Rich and Noble, Down to the petty Knave and Punk, Religion's made a Bubble. The Dignify'd Adulterer: OR, The Libertine of Title. The mighty Man, that rides in State, Puff'd up with Wealth and Title; Altho' his Sins are ne'er so great, The Scandal is but little. His publick Grandeur puts a Gloss Upon his Crimes and Vices; And tho' his Sins are ne'er so gross, They never want Disguises. What tho' h' as basely kill'd a Man Wallow'd in Fornications? His Chaplain soon can wash him clean, With pious Dedications. The Poets too will draw their Pens, To vindicate his Honour; Because they hope, to make Amends, He'll prove a lib'ral Donor. Designing Rogues and humble Slaves, For Riches only prize Men; And he that wins the Fools and Knaves, Need never fear the wise Men. Sappho obtain'd a God-like Fame, By Parrots Proclamation; So the rich Fool oft gets a Name, By Poets Dedication. If mighty Gods can thus be made, By Birds unskilful chatt'ring; What can't the Muses (if well pay'd) Accomplish, by their flatt'ring? 'Tis they that cheat the Apes and Owls, With Songs of Praise and Satyr; And, by their Arts, draw little Fools To idolize the greater. Sir Narcissus Foplin: OR, The Self-Admirer. How cross a Jilt, how base a Trull, Is purblind Madam Fortune, Who proves so gen'rous to the Fool, And to the Wise uncertain? What Fops and Monsters do we see Sit lolling in their Coaches, And haughty Apes, of high Degree, Grow proud of their Debauches? Whilst Men of Brains and Vertue, stand Depending at a Distance; And bowing down, with Cap in Hand, Implore the Fools Assistance. One thinks, that Whoring is a Vice, Of all the rest, most noble; And, to enjoy his Paradise, Becomes the Ladies Bubble. A second, finds another Trick, Much worse than Fornication; And, in his Lust, wants Grace to stick At Male-Administration. A third, two powerful Vices join, For want of sober Thinking; And, adding Women to his Wine, Delights in Love and Drinking. A fourth, becomes a Rake at large, Pursues all wicked Measures, And values no Expence or Charge, To purchase sinful Pleasures. Yet, if they be but rich and great, Tho' impious as the Devil, They must be wise, in Spite of Fate, And good, in Spite of Evil. The Worthy Patriot: OR, The True English Nobleman. Some boast of Honours, Wealth, and Blood, Which they, by Birth inherit, And aim to be thought great and good, Without one Grain of Merit: But 'tis not Title or Degree, That makes us truly noble, Because a gilded Fool may be A Coward and a Bubble. Wealth may be got by knavish Craft, Or be the Gift of Fortune; And Honours be bestow'd as oft For Pranks behind the Curtain: These are not always the Reward Of Vertue, or of Brav'ry; But have been heretofore conferr'd On Minions, for their Knav'ry. When Titles are of long Descent, What Man can tell how Honour Was first obtain'd, or how 'twas meant, When given by the Donor? Sometimes we've seen the fawning Slave Made great, for little Reason; And Honour's heap'd upon a Knave, To stop his hatching Treason. What Mortal then would idolize High Titles and Exteriors, Unless his Worship was more wise And just, than his Inferiors? Let no Man boast his high Degree, Wealth, Honour, Education, Unless h'as Will and Pow'r to be A Champion for his Nation. FINIS.</field>
