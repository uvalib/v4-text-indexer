      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. AIREDALE IN ANCIENT TIMES. Though greatest bards have sung most earthly things, And scarcely left me room to touch the strings, Yet humbly would I from the crowd retire, And strike, though feebly, the responsive lyre. By Nature's hand, O, may my harp be strung, While I attempt the Vale that ne'er was sung! Spirit of Ancient Times! my genius turn To scenes long past—and make my fancy burn! Genius of History! Learning's loveliest maid, Around me let thy mantle be displayed;— Let all thy powers together be combined, My soul t' illumine, and support my mind! Lead me, O Muse, along Aire's winding course, To sing of Gordale—its tremendous source, Where terror sits, and scorns the poet's pen, The painter's pencil,—all the pow'rs of men: Where sons of science oft confounded stand, To view this wonder of the Almighty's hand! Here, in dark shade, the rifted rocks appear, The bursting cataracts assail the ear; Projecting masses to the clouds are piled, And Grandeur revels in her palace wild! E'en those that to description would aspire, Gaze mute with awe, and silently retire. Here fierce banditti once securely slept, And joyous revelled, while the plundered wept. We now, secure, these awful cliffs survey, Nor dread to fall the base assassin's prey. But softer scenes on Malham Water view, When its smooth breast reflects the azure blue; Or when the skiffs, departing from its shore, Convey the lovely nymphs of Craven o'er The still lake ruffled by each rower's stroke, And its smooth surface into surges broke,— The circling woods return their cheerful song, As nymphs and swains harmonious glide along; While at the flies the glittering fishes bound, And twice ten thousand eddies circle round. Anon 'tis ruffled like the foam-white sea, Then smooth as glass, reflecting ev'ry tree; The lofty fells upon its breast are seen, Brown here with heath, and there with brackens green; Health, rosy Health, diseases drives away, And Pleasure loves amid those scenes to stray. Firm fixed near, like the great throne of Jove, Stands, rudely great, old Malham's lofty Cove, From whence, in storms, the bursting streams are hurled, Met by the winds, to misty vapours whirled. Here the brave Percies, foremost in the chase, Were followed by the sons of Clifford's race; Listers and Tempests, on the jocund morn, Obeyed the cheerful summons of the horn; Malhams and Martons, on their hunters fleet, Scattered the moorland moss beneath their feet,— Rode down the rocky hills with rapid force, And still undaunted held their ardent course, While nodding antlers of the mountain deer Topped the high hills,—the hounds, the hunters near; Next took the vale, and with ambition tried Which rider durst o'erleap Aire's infant tide. The shepherds in the valley left their flocks, Climbed the high hills, and shouted on the rocks. But, oh! how soon does human greatness fall! What years has ruin dwelt in Clifford's hall! The lord, the baron, and the warrior still, And mute the horn on Elso's lofty hill! The sons of Craven now are happier far,— No Scottish warriors wage the cruel war, As when the sons of Gargrave sallied forth To meet the fierce invaders from the north; When on the shields the battle-axes rung, Spears broke, helms cleft, and many a bow was strung! Death through Northumbria's fields had marked their way, And mothers wept where lifeless husbands lay; Friends, kindred, lovers, on the earth expired, Their dwellings plundered, and their churches fired; The holy crucifix away was borne, And from the shrines the sacred relics torn; The sacramental wine they rudely quaffed, Smiled o'er the flames, and at destruction laughed! But when these hordes arrived on Craven's height, The sons of Gargrave met them in the fight; Percy and Garri made a noble stand, And fought their threefold numbers hand to hand. His well-tried sword brave Garri whirled around, And brought three Scottish leaders to the ground; The blade of Percy bore the fray so well, Beneath his arm five Northern warriors fell, Their helms he cleft with many a mighty stroke,— His tempered weapon bent—but never broke. No banner waved, no trumpets sounded clear, T' inspire their breasts—'twas silent conflict there! The brackens green, where the hot battle burned, To crimson with the warriors' gore were turned; But soon of Percy's band but ten remained, The mountain stream with streaks of blood was stained; The deep-dyed waters crept, meandering slow, As loth to tell the tragic tale below; There many a wounded youth, oppressed with pain, Laid on the earth—their pillows were the slain. With conquest fired, the Northerns sallied down, To plunder Gargrave's lone deserted town; The blazing brands within the church they hurled, And soon the flames around the altar curled, While from the burning roof the molten lead Dropped on the ancient tombstones of the dead; The blood-red sun sank slowly in the west, As by the dreadful scene of woe oppressed: But plunder ceased not in the shades of night, The blazing ruins lent a baleful light, Till Skipton's sons appeared, with banners red— The Scots beheld their glitt'ring arms and fled! What little cause have moderns to complain, Throughout our isle!—no native warriors slain; Our fertile valleys, in improving charms, With Commerce smile, secure from war's alarms. How changed, since Skipton's ancient towers arose, Their country's strength, and terror of its foes! Where Meschinès, the long-ejected heir, Led to the altar Cicily the Fair, Obtaining thus, what many a life had cost, With his fair bride, the lands his father lost;— All those domains which Edwin once possessed, Where famed Romili fixed his place of rest. By ancient chiefs to Skipton then were brought, The arms with which the Norman warriors fought; Cuirass and corslet, helm and brigantine, Worn by the warriors of the Norman line, Bows, quivers, darts, and many a massive spear, Lances and swords, have oft been polished there; Banners, which waved when shields and helmets rung, Were all to Skipton brought, and safely hung High in the tower, as in a place of trust, Now wasted all, and worn away with rust. Here, gorgeous, glittered, once in days of old, Satins of various dyes, adorned with gold; The ladies' vests with gems were spangled o'er, And silvered robes the ancient Cliffords wore; Their hangings were of silk, with silver tinged, And velvet canopies with gold were fringed; Whole butts of wine were in the cellar stowed, And in the hall the vessels oft o'erflowed, Upon each dish the dragon was portrayed, And underneath a gory lion laid, Warriors and arms were 'graven on the plate, To show their fathers wished them to be great; Upon their cups, embossed, was many a shield, And this strong charge—“Let Cliffords never yield!” Upon the wall their bright steel armour hung, With dimples marked, where many a spear had rung. Then many a sumptuous lordly feast was kept, And ladies here o'er warriors slain have wept; Here lords have hunted through their wide domains, Rode o'er the rocks, and galloped on the plains; Here ancient sports, and many a Northern bard, Passed not unheeded nor without regard; Here many a night of jollity has been, And festive mirth was stamped on every scene: But how can scenes of centuries long gone by, With all the ancient feats of chivalry, Their feuds, their battles, revelry and sport, Their imitations of the monarch's court; Their priest, revered, by superstition fed, Who, they believed, could liberate the dead; The sieges which the lofty towers sustained, Till on their tops no battlement remained; Their great possessors, since the Norman king?— Crowd all at once—too much for me to sing: Then, oh forgive a feeble rustic bard, When he admits the mighty task too hard! Yet here, alone, to pass some pensive hours, In walking round these desolated towers, Where late such greatness and such valour dwelt, Reflection, sure, the hardest heart would melt. But to the vale I'll turn, where Aire winds slow, And its pure waters scarcely seem to flow; Where cattle fed, and scarce a wall was seen, But all one wide extended park of green; Or, when the native butter-flow'rets blew, The valley shone in robes of golden hue, The mountain's side with ash was spotted o'er, Which Nature planted centuries before; Above, the huge grey rocks, which ne'er had broke Since the creation with the hammer's stroke, Where prickly furze for ages blossomed round, And the brown heath the lofty mountains crowned, From whence the crystal rills did gushing flow, To seek repose within the vale below; Where the young shepherds sought the cooling shade, And underneath the far spread branches laid, Tuned their sweet pipes, their flocks all grazing round, While their loved nymphs stood list'ning to the sound. Then near some lonely grange upon the green, Where the old yew-trees had for cent'ries been, In rural bliss the loving pairs would play, And quite forget the labours of the day,— Sing of some ancient warriors whom they knew, Firm to their king, and to their country true; Or of some maid, who loved, but could not gain The fickle heart of her too haughty swain,— How oft she wandered in the fields alone, Till reason and her beauty all were gone. They sung, till tears stood trembling in each eye, And not a heart was there but heaved a sigh. Next, on his staff, oppressed with weight of years, The father comes, and calls them in to prayers; His reverend looks they dare not disobey,— The worst from ev'ning worship could not stay: Then from his heart the Pater Noster flows,— He worships God as truly as he knows; No new fanatics can with him compare, In true devotion, and the fervent prayer. But I must sing of scenes more ancient still, When offerings smoked upon the rocky hill; In days long past, when, circled round with wood, The lowly huts of pristine warriors stood, Where the majestic oaks their branches spread, And for the Druids formed a sacred shade,— Who, at one period of the changing year, Did for their deep, imposing rites prepare. White as the snow their sacred vests appeared; They as the gods' vicegerents were revered. On every hill the milk-white beasts were sought; When found, with joy they to the groves were brought. Then virgins culled the flowers with greatest care, To strive who could the richest wreath prepare; While to the harps of bards the peasants sung, And round the beasts the rosy garlands hung. The rock, which yet retains the Altar's name, Had honours paid, and mighty was its fame. There, 'tis presumed, the mistletoe was laid, While to their unknown god the Druids prayed; There were domestic quarrels made to cease, And foes at variance thence returned in peace. Unlike the various priests of modern days, So different, that they teach a thousand ways; And though they boast superior knowledge given, Who knows but Druids taught the way to heaven? Then all returning from the Altar's height, Some filled with awe, some smiling with delight, While ancient bards, as slow they moved along, Touched their wild harps, and this their artless song: Now with the gods our peace is made, No demon's spell or charm Can make our hawthorn blossoms fade, Our flock or herbage harm. Safe from the wolf and furious boar We rest another year; No fox shall take our feathered store, Or make our springs less clear. No fairy climb the lofty oak, The sacred plant Mistletoe. to kill; No warrior wear a bloody cloak, Or fall upon the hill. No eagle, from the stormy north, Shall our young lambs destroy; Nor hawk nor raven shall come forth, To blast our rural joy. But ev'rything we want is ours, Bestowed by bounteous Heaven, And falls like fruitful rain in showers, If for them praise be given. Oft on the hills, to chase the dappled deer, The painted Britons would in troops appear; Swift as the hind they bounded o'er the plain— The sportive chase was then their only gain. They knew not then the sickle, scythe, nor hoe; No panting oxen laboured at the plough: Their flocks and herds were then their only store, They lived content, nor knew, nor wished for more. But, if their chiefs had struck upon the shield, And called their warriors to the embattled field, They left their homes, and all their rural charms, And o'er their painted shoulders threw their arms: The British virgins, while their bows were strung, Joined with the native bards, while thus they sung: Britain! the land by gods beloved, The land of warriors brave, Who ever meet their foes unmoved, Nor dread the hero's grave. By barbarous foes unconquered still, The pastures yet our own; And ours the grove and sacred hill, While Cuno Cunobuline, a British prince. wears the crown. The northern nations, fierce, may come, To waste our fruitful field; But those shall rue they left their home, And soon to Britons yield. Arm, warriors, arm! your children call— The gods will give you aid; Before your spears your foes shall fall, The mighty army fade! Arm, warriors, arm! your all defend— The Highland foe is near! Let all upon the gods depend, And strangers be to fear! With quivers filled, and brazen spears, With trumpets loud and strong, Rush to the fight—the foe appears, But foes shall not be long. Thus sung the bards—and at their words, At once the warriors drew From brazen sheaths their glitt'ring swords, And to the conflict flew. So 'twas of old, one dreadful day, Which ancient bards did sing, When mighty warriors fled away, Like hawks upon the wing. Fierce were their foes,—the savage boar Had lent its bristled hide, Which they for barbarous helmets wore, With various colours dyed. Upon their breasts imagined beasts And monsters were portrayed; The Highland skins, with labour dressed, Was then their tartan plaid. Dreadfully grim the van appeared, A far extended line; From wing to wing their spears, upreared, Did bright as silver shine. The Britons waited not to view Or study dangers o'er; But, dauntless, in their chariots flew, And stained their arms in gore. The conflicts on the fields of Troy To this were but a fray; Each Grecian warrior but a boy, To those who fought that day. No room to bear the banners high; No breath to give command; No heart to fear, no way to fly; But warrior hand to hand! Swords cut like saws, and broke in twain, And spears as crimson red, Were strewed all o'er the bloody plain, Or grasped by many dead. Thus, when the Picts or Romans came in sight, The Britons rushed like torrents to the fight; Their chariot wheels with sharpest weapons hung, And from each car were darts and arrows flung; Death marked the way where'er the chariots turned, And round each chief the bloody battle burned: But if the artful cohorts gained the field, The Britons made the woods their nightly shield, And when the Romans thought the battle won, They found, next morn, the conflict scarce begun. Thus Britons fought,—by Boadicea led, And on the slain the wolves and eagles fed. Say, winding Aire, ye rocks, ye woods, and hills, How you were stained—and how your crystal rills Ran crimsoned with your native warriors' blood, When on the heights the Roman eagles stood, Where Olicano's rocky station rose, And Briton bowed, reluctant, to her foes! But now, could Greece her ancient grandeur gain, Could Roman chiefs once more resume their reign; Could Cæsar leap on shore to invade our land, And all his legions pour upon the strand; Should Alexander, with his mighty host, With Xerxes in the rear—all threat'ning boast To bring the myriads of their warriors here, The troops of Waterloo would never fear, For one dread day like that at Trafalgar, Had brought to peace the ten years' Trojan war! O Nature! be my muse—to touch the scene Of Bingley's glories, which long since have been: When in full splendour were its ancient halls, And high achievements graced their massy walls; When oaks, which now the whirlwind's force withstand, Had bent to earth beneath an infant's hand, Where winding Aire, enamoured of the place, Moves on so slow, it seems to stop and gaze;— To leave the scene the glitt'ring river mourns, And shows reluctance in its varied turns, Till, forced at last, it rushes down the steep, Turns into rage, as if too proud to weep! Could I but call some venerable shade, Whose earthly part a thousand years has laid Within the tomb, in silent, soft repose, Perhaps it might such things as these disclose: Where rolls the stream above yon sacred fane, And where the hills, in Time's all-wasting reign, Have changed their forms; while, struggling for its way, The furious flood has torn a part away Of yonder fields, which bear a castle's name,— There once a castle stood, though lost to fame: But, safely sheltered from the feudal rage, It gained no place in the historian's page; And as the greatest temples rise and fall, So none can tell where stood its ancient hall; Its Gothic arches and strong-built keep, Within th' adjacent floods are buried deep; The strong foundations of its lofty towers, Crumbled to sand, and washed away with showers! The river's course a thousand times has changed, Since on its banks the ancient Druids ranged; The fords, which once the Roman cohorts crossed, Filled up with sand, are now for ever lost. The course, now fields, where once the river ran— Emblem of empires, and of changing man! The streams of Science once through Egypt flowed, When Thebes in all its ancient grandeur glowed; Then left the margin of the fruitful Nile, Crossed o'er to Greece, and made great Athens smile. Athens and Corinth fell—and Rome appeared, Stretched forth her empire, and no danger feared, Till Gothic ignorance, with sable robe Of darkest superstition, wrapt the globe. Then bigot Fury reared its hydra head; Then Science sunk, and all the Muses fled To their own shades, and there for cent'ries mourned, Nor to Parnassus have they yet returned: At length on earth again they deigned to smile, And fixed their residence on Albion's isle. But stop, my Muse—haste not so far away! I'll woo thee in my native vale to stay. Its beauties be thy theme—the woods and dells, Sequestered bowers, and sweet melodious bells; The flow'r-deck'd lawn, the distant heath-crowned hills, Stupendous rocks, and softly-murmuring rills; The woodland echoes whispering in the trees, Or floating loudly on the fitful breeze; Where nought of sameness the charmed sight offends, But every scene the former scene transcends; Where rocks in rich variety are dressed, Some in the grey, and some the auburn vest; Where varying Nature gives the lovely tinge, And on the banks suspends the mossy fringe. But where's the bard can sing of Bingley's vale, And never once in his descriptions fail? 'Tis here the modest snow-drop first appears, Drooping its head, and wet with icy tears, Like some poor bard, unknown to public fame, It shrinks and withers on its native stem. And here the primrose, from its mossy bed, Silver'd with dew lifts up its lovely head, Where springing woodbine to the hazel cleaves, With snow still pressing down its velvet leaves. How pleasant here to walk, when daisies spring, While the sweet bells in tuneful changes ring, When ev'ry tone the echoing woods receive, And thus delightfully the ear deceive, Reverberating, mellow, sweet and clear, As though a far more dulcet peal was there! Could I describe the days of olden time, When first this valley heard the varying chime;— I hear them yet—am present at the hour When zealous crowds from every village pour, At early morn, upon the holy day, To worship God, confess their sins, and pray. No bigot sects come proudly, faults to find, But all one creed, one doctrine, heart, and mind. The Church, establish'd, is their favourite place, And reverence dwells on every varied face. The manor's lord, with all his household, comes,— His honest tenants leave their distant homes; The rural peasant takes his frugal wife, And ev'ry child, without religious strife. The aged come, with years of labour worn, Nor stop, though distant, on the holy morn. The daughter here an aged mother bears, Supports her steps, her fainting spirits cheers; And there the son leads on his pious sire, Warmed with devotion's purest, holiest fire. 'Tis reverence all—no lightsome smile appears, See them, and blush, ye modern worshippers! Your fathers met their Maker to adore, Devoutly read the Vulgate verses o'er, And from the priest words of affection flowed— He prayed, he wept—until the list'ning crowd Melted to tears; and tears that were not feigned, Like crystal drops, from all the audience rained. Such were the days when churches were rebuilt, Though days of darkness, not so great their guilt. Though history has shaded o'er with crimes The long past period of the feudal times, Here foreign luxuries were yet unknown, And all they wished was in the valley grown,— Their wholesome food was butter, cheese, and milk, And Airedale's ladies never shone in silk; The line they grew their own soft hands prepared, The wool unheeded to the poor was spared;— But few the poor, unless by age oppressed, At little rent some acres each possessed. When from the fields the golden sheaves were led, The lovely fair could glean their winter's bread; The husbandman could to his cottage bear The withered boughs, his frugal hearth to cheer, Or oft at eve his willow basket, stored With wholesome viands from his lib'ral lord; Or did he want for Lent a proper dish, Aire's silv'ry streams produced unnumbered fish; Their fruitful boughs the mellow apples bore, And plum-trees bended with the sable store;— The ills which crowded population brings, Had never broke, sweet rural bliss, thy wings! Then on the green the nymphs and swains would dance, Or, in a circle, tell some old romance; And all the group would seriously incline To hear of Saracens and Palestine,— Of knights in armour of each various hue, Of ladies left, some false, and others true. Their pure descriptions showed how warriors bled, How virgins wept to hear of heroes dead— The furious steeds swift rushing to the war, The turbann'd Turks, the bloody scimitar,— The cross-marked banners on the lofty height, The impious struck with terror at the sight! Then told what spectres grim were seen to glide Along this dale, before its heroes died, Then marked their fall within the holy vale, Described them, lifeless, in their coats of mail,— Told how some lady, frantic with despair, Shriek'd, as she plung'd into the deeps of Aire, When tidings reach'd her from the Holy Land, That her lov'd lord lay deep in Jordan's sand— And how her shrieks flew echoing through the wood, While her rich jewels glittered in the flood! Thus happy they their summer's evening spent, Parted in peace, and homeward singing went; Their voices, soft as th' Æolian strings, Flew to sweet Echo on the halcyon's wings. Such was this vale when Kirkstall's glories shone, And who can help but sigh that they are gone? 'Tis pleasant yet to see how ivy clings Around the walls where night birds clap their wings; A solemn awe pervades the feeling breast, To view the sacred earth with ruins pressed— The fallen arch, the shatter'd tower on high, Remind us of the days and years gone by; Imagination sees the whole entire— The smoke yet curling in the ancient choir, And slowly as the clouds of incense roll, The fragrant grateful scent perfumes the whole, While the great organ, solemn, deep, and strong, Joins with the worshippers in sacred song;— Beholds the Abbot in his robes arrayed, The altar wet, where once Turgesius prayed, The tapers burning, till each holy shrine More brilliant than the thrones of monarchs shine. The glitt'ring cross, the Virgin's image there, Before the imagination all appear; The veiled nuns, on some grand solemn night, Ranged on each side, in vests of purest white. Though centuries intervene, yet fancy hears The Abbot reading o'er the Latin prayers; How still—how awful! as the solemn strain Now swells, and now to whispers falls again! Till the Te Deum, bursting from the crowd, Sounds like the seas, when winds and waves are loud, In all the diapasons deep or clear, Man could invent, or his weak passions bear! The spot where once the gorgeous shrine was seen, Is cover'd with a mossy robe of green; Elms in the cloisters grow, and like a pall, Hide the fine mouldings of the southern wall; Upon the place where many a knight lies low, Weeds, nettles, and the baneful nightshade grow, While on the cornice wildly waves the fern, Like verdant plumes, in many a graceful turn. How chang'd is Kirkstall, since to ruin turned, And slow departing the last abbot mourned; When ancient records, kept with pious care, Clung to the boughs which overhung the Aire, Or, tossed in flames, or into pieces torn, Like autumn leaves upon the winds were borne; Its income gone, and lost its fruitful land, Which was bequeathed by many a dying hand; The granges ruined, and the cattle sold, The sheep removed to a far distant fold; All that was good and precious swept away, And seiz'd by desolation as its prey! Of all its wealth the once famed place bereft, And but the walls were to the artist left, While many a pensive stranger, passing by, Stops to admire, then leaves them with a sigh! The scenes how changed, since Loidi's castle stood Encircled by the ancient park and wood! Where streets are now, the shining pheasants flew, Or cattle cropped the daisies closed with dew; Commerce, to Albion's modern sons so dear, Had never spread her golden pinions there. Where churches stand, some centuries ago, The swift-wing'd arrow left the archer's bow,— A village small, no vessel then could ride, The sails unfurling in commercial pride, A place of little note and scarcely known, Whose fame now widely spreads through ev'ry zone. The village youth then heard but Kirkstall's bells, And rustics sported where the organ swells; Where now extends the great commercial street, The virgins pluck'd the hawthorn blossoms sweet, And where the spacious public halls are seen, In times remote was once the village green, Where noontide hours, and many a summer's night, Were danc'd away with feelings of delight. Upon the hills where oaks for cent'ries grew, Years, undisturbed, the glossy pheasants flew; Partridge and hares in ev'ry field were bred, And never fell, struck by the murd'ring lead. From aged furze, or from the lonely rocks, Oft nightly wander'd forth the wily fox; The valleys echoed on the early morn, With hounds, with huntsman, and the cheerful horn! Then, as they crossed the vale, fleet as the air, Forsaken, lagg'd behind, old wrinkled Care, Joy joined the chase, and cheered each sportive mind, And Sorrow there could no companion find. The life-inspiring cries the hunter knew, And from each breast dark melancholy flew; Pleasure and Mirth the foremost led the chase, And rosy health was shining on each face. With all our modern concerts, parties, balls, Assembly rooms, our theatres and halls, Are we more happy than the ancient lord, With good October sparkling on his board, His warriors round him, and the tuneful lyre Strung by the bards, who sang his valiant sire;— A lady lov'd, who strove her lord to please; A priest at hand his troubled breast to ease? One wife he lov'd, the chase, and moral song,— No follies broke his constitution strong: His guests true hearted, each a warrior brave, And not a heart but scorn'd to be a slave. To-day they to the chase or feasting yield, To-morrow duty calls them to the field. With learning unrefined, they knew no fear, When front to front they met the shining spear. Such were the sons of Leeds when Towton's plain Was crimsoned o'er with thirty thousand slain; Their king they lov'd, and for their king they died, While Wharf's clear stream roll'd on a purple tide; And if our favoured isle continue free, Such must the modern lords of Britain be. THE LYRE OF EBOR. Let Northern Poets sing of Highland glens, Their rocky caverns, and their sombre dens; The heath-clad mountains, and their high cascades, Their gurgling streams, and moonlight fairy shades; Their rugged tow'ring rocks, grown grey with years, On whose rough front the bilberry bloom appears; Their ancient oaks, by Nature tumbled down, O'er whose huge trunks the mossy robe is thrown; And scenes which triumph o'er description's power— All these are seen near Barden's ancient tower, Where peaceful, dwelt, some centuries ago, Those that durst meet in arms the Border foe. Or climb the hills, in ancient hawking skilled, And bear the bow with brazen quivers filled, Then send the arrow from the powerful string, That stopped the fleeting salmon's finny wing; Or, did the eagle soar above his head, A shaft flies swift—the soaring eagle's dead. Oft, when at eve, he wandered near the rocks, And on their shelves beheld the wily fox, Swift flew the arrow from the well-strung bow, And brought his victim to the vale below. In this romantic, wild, and hidden place, The sons of Craven oft enjoyed the chase; When Cliffords for a time hung by their arms, And lived secure amidst their valley's charms. The deer and fox they seldom then pursued, But monsters, that oft stained their tusks with blood, To which the traveller feared to fall a prey, And mothers wept for children borne away. A crimson robe o'er Sol's bright orb was spread, Which tinged the hills, and every mountain's head, When near the rural stables, formed of wood, With horses fleet, the humble vassals stood; Then the old horn, with long-forgotten sound, Sent forth its notes to all the woods around; The woods, as though they each possessed a horn, Gave softer tones, t' improve the jocund morn. The ancient Cliffords, with the bow and spear, In hunting dress of bristled hides appear; Their vassals send to range the forest o'er, And find the cavern of the furious boar. Primo gave mouth, as down the hills they went, Where the rough monster late had left his scent: As bees, when swarming, near their queen are found, So sung around the best, each favourite hound. The various deep-mouthed notes, distinct and strong, Flew to the woods, as echo flies along; The deer, affrighted, climbed the park's high hill, Ranged for the worst, in silence all stood still. The boar, enraged, the loosened earth upheaves, Shows his huge fangs, his den reluctant leaves; Ten years of rapine had improved his strength— His tusks and bristles each a foot in length. Then were the sons of ancient Barden near, And those of Buckden, who the chase could cheer. Bolton's strong youths, and those of Hazelwood, In rustic pride upon the mountains stood; And on their steeds old Skipton's sons came o'er The rocky hills, to hunt this mighty boar. Then were no dandies, delicately laced, With all the beauty of a Frenchman graced; But each was such as might have met in war Foes on the rock, the mountain, or the scar, And such as for their country had been tried, With those who for their constitution died; Such as had fought, but none could make them yield, When front to front they met on Flodden field, Where many left their nearest kindred slain, But ne'er refused to meet their foes again. The sand young Clifford held was half run down, When for the chase the cheerful horn was blown; Then was the best of Craven hunts begun, The lords e'er saw, or hounds could ever run. Down bent the bushes as he ran along, While every hound joined in the enlivening song, Old Barden's oaks so low their branches spread, That none could ride, but each his hunter led. Ofttimes the monster stopped, as in disdain, Then heard the shouts, and hastened on again; Till from the woody shades he burst away, And with him burst the glories of the day! Some sunk in bogs, and nearly buried, stood, While others, shouting, issued from the wood; Beheld the hounds spread on their scented way, While Posforth Gill just kept them from their prey. Clifford rode first, and swift the chase he led, While the black heath was dimpled as he fled; Next Skipton's sons, and those of Barden Fell, Followed in quick succession through the dell: Anon, the youths of Bolton led the way, Then Eastby hunters rode the first that day; While Rilstone riders showed themselves to be Far better horsemen than the moderns see. The footmen stopped behind, half filled with fears That his rough hide was proof against their spears; Then high o'er Hober's hill, whose sable crest Oft with the furious monster had been prest, The cheerful tenants of the woody vale Shouted sometimes, then told a hunting tale; Till, swelling on the breeze, they hear the sounds Of hunters' shouts, and cry of eager hounds. The answering shouts from its high top arise, And hats and caps are cast toward the skies! Ofttimes the boar would strive to seek repose, Then front to front would meet his coming foes; And, as he found his every effort vain, He hastened, panting, further up the plain. At length he found a chasm, where oft he'd lain, Half filled with bones of victims he had slain. The hunters came, and raised their shining spears— His blazing eye-balls showed he knew no fears. The fiercest British bull-dogs stood around, At last a mastiff his deep cavern found; Three bull-dogs followed, two of which were slain, Before they brought him to the light again. A rash young hunter would have thrown his spear, But Clifford raised his arm, and cried, “Forbear! The sun has reached not the meridian sky, Let there be nobler sport before he die.” The streams of Wharf roared not in rapid flood, But sung in semichorus through the wood. The hunters saw him rise the western hill, Then those were tried who had true horsemen's skill. Clifford stopped not at Wharf to ask how deep, When each had swiftly galloped down the steep, But crossed the ford, and on the sporting day, His followers whitened Wharf's broad streams with spray. The waters curled around each horse's mane, While the beat foam fell on their heads like rain; But soon all forded safe, and every care Was thrown like feathers to the empty air. The calling of the Muse has grown so stale, And in the foremost lines of every tale, Such invocations by each scribbler's penned, That she'll no more to poets' prayers attend; Else for her aid would I sincerely pray, T' inspire me while I sing that glorious day, When swift to Simon Seat's dark rocky height, The bristly monster took his rapid flight; Thrice to their prey the noble pack was near, As oft he turned, and stopped their speed with fear. Since Wharf's clear stream within the Strid was bound, The lovely vales ne'er echoed such a sound; Nor all the hunting of the fox and deer Could equal this in true heroic cheer. The hills and vales in echoing concert sung, Till near the rocks the hunters' bows were strung; Then was the glory of the hunting crowned, And mastiff, bull-dog, hunter, horse, and hound. All on an acre of the rocky hill, Ambitious each the mighty boar to kill. Low on the earth the savage monster sate, And, sullen, seemed to meet his coming fate; Then did the hounds attempt to seize his hide, But, weary, thrice fell panting at his side. Though better steeds for hunting never met, The brightest bays were changed to brown with sweat; And such had been the chase, the stoutest there Had scarcely strength to reach him with his spear. But brave young Clapham, of old Beamsley Hall, Sent the first shaft, which made the monster fall. While low was laid the tyrant of the wood, Each hound seemed greedy to devour his blood: But soon he rose, made frantic with his pain, And dared his various foes to approach again; Three hounds he seized, and each resigned his breath, Before the mighty monster fell in death. Young Clifford, grieved to see his fav'rites dead, Took his bright spear, and pierced him through the head. In death his bloody jaws were opened wide, While the red foam was thrown on every side; The vale of Barden now with shouting rung— This song the harpers have for ages sung: Young Clifford, the hunter, who rode on that day, From Barden's strong portals first hasted away; His horse was the fleetest that e'er trod the moss, And the best that the streams of a river could cross: Whether hounds were pursuing the fox or the boar, He seldom was left on the wild heathy moor. Three times to the Strid his brave master he bore, And thrice on that day the deep gulf he leaped o'er. Whenever they hunted the boar or the fox, The hoofs of his hunter would ring on the rocks; A better in Craven there never was tried, And none but brave Clapham could come near his side. The foam from his mouth as the feathers he throws, Or white as the flakes, when it silently snows; He is fit for the mountain, the valley, or scars, And he champs his bright bits when he goes to the wars; As good as the steed was the rider he bore, And his equal in Craven shall never be more. Strike the harp to his praise, and the praise of the fair, May blessings attend them wherever they are! If the soft kiss of peace be the lot of the bride, Or the tear-drop of love, when affection is tried, When happy at home, or engaged on the field, May her prayers be all answered, and Heaven his shield! The monster dead, the valleys rung with praise, In louder shouts than those of modern days; Then from this dreaded powerful beast of prey, With Clifford's sword, the head was cut away: Then vassal, tenant, shepherd, lord and knight, To Barden haste to spend the festive night. Whate'er great Clifford's table could afford, Was then enjoyed by vassal, knight and lord; Then o'er old Barden Bridge young Clifford led His comrades, shouting, with the monster's head. But clouds obscured the fast declining sun, To rumble deep the thunder had begun; The pouring torrents, lightning, hail, and rain, Hid Whernside's top, and deluged all the plain. The mountain rocks, clad in their moss array, Reared their high heads, by time half worn away. The pond'rous blocks were hurried down the steep, Hurled o'er the cat'racts to the foaming deep. Old oaks, which long in Bolton Park had stood, Forced from their stations, rolled upon the flood; What once were weak and tinkling crystal rills, Rolled rumbling, foaming, dashing down the hills,— Clothed in a brown and muddy robe of spray, Bearing the rocks, like captives forced away. The pond'rous bridge, perhaps three centuries old, Gave way, and on the dashing flood was rolled, And stones which on the battlements had stood, Were hurried far down Wharf's deceitful flood: While every torrent from the heathy brow, Gushed in grand cat'racts to the floods below. The Vale of Desolation was a scene Which for long ages never once had been. The massive rocks, which had for ages stood, Were tossed like pebbles in the boiling flood; The mossy robes torn off they'd borne for years— And left the valley as it now appears, Rough, waste, and wild, in every varied form Marked with the terrors of the thunderstorm. The river's brink with withered roots is hung, Roots which had lived perhaps ere Chaucer sung. Broad in the east the sable cloud was spread, The lightnings flashed o'er Chevin's lofty head; While o'er the west an azure robe was cast, Spangled with stars, which showed the storm was past. Then mirth began in Barden's ancient hall, The huntsman gave again the morning call; Inspired with good old ale his horn he took— They shouted till the massive pillars shook. When Clifford brought the boar's terrific head, With whose huge fangs a thousand deer had bled; Then, as in mirth the evening passed along, A Craven warrior sang his favourite song: I have been on the stormy wave, And fought upon the gory field; Laid many a warrior in his grave, My lovely Jane of Hellifield. On northern hills I met the foe, Where furious strength my sword did wield, And she who made me use it so, Was my dear Jane of Hellifield. I thought upon her lovely form, And knew 'twas death, should I once yield; Love, honour, glory, like a storm, Raged for my Jane of Hellifield. I thought each warrior gains the praise Of all, if he's the country's shield; Then rushed amid the battle's blaze, To fight for Jane of Hellifield. The Highland Scots came boldly forth, And bravely did their claymores wield, Fierce as the tempest of the north— Then I forgot sweet Hellifield. We met ofttimes, each side pursues, And many a steel-cased warrior reeled; At last they fled—I hoped the news Would reach my Jane of Hellifield. The English ranks they could not break, While these with spears and lances kneeled; And Scotland's army soon grew weak, Or I had ne'er reached Hellifield. But, marked with scars, with pension blest, My heart's with scenes of battle steeled; Yet, there's a place within my breast That still loves Jane of Hellifield. Now will I drink unto my king, May subjects ever be his shield, And time fly sweetly on the wing With me and Jane of Hellifield! The bard was called—to Craven then unknown, Who oft his fingers o'er the harp had thrown; Nature to him had such a genius given, That his wild fancy almost soared to heaven. The bard appears, and with a modest air He struck his harp, as merit's self was there; True native genius beamed in either eye, And on his lyre hung wildest melody. He borrowed not his airs, nor learnt the chords, But both composed, while nature brought the words; His harp he touched in ancient concert fine, While soft attention hung for every line— They hoped to hear some cheerful sportive air, But wildly thus he sung, as in despair: The noble hall, where beauty reigns, The hall that's now a peaceful home, Shall soon be lost, and youth and bliss Shall fade, and ruin hither come. This night I saw a spectre bard In martial chords sweep o'er his lyre; I saw the warrior chiefs prepared, In shining arms and bright attire. I saw the lovely lady fair, Weep as she parted with her knight; And heard her breathe to Heav'n a prayer That Heav'n would shield him in the fight. I heard the whizzing arrows fly, And saw the battle-axes broke; The stoutest of the warriors die, When death was victor ev'ry stroke. I saw the great portcullis fall, Which shook the gateway with its power; Beheld the engines at thy wall, Whose force could shake the topmost tower. My fancy saw the bloody field, Which stretches into yonder plain; On its dread space was many a shield, And pale the features of the slain. I thought in this dread scene I stood, Though trembling yet I longed to stay, Though moonbeams glittered on their blood, And plund'rers took their spoil away. The harper struck a martial air, Ruin and desolation came; A brand was hurled by wild despair, And every tow'r was soon on flame. Their arms were nerved with dying pain, And every blow they struck the last, The soldiers lay with nobles slain— So this portentous phantom past. No cheerful strains upon my lyre The bard this night can bring to you, The scene of Barden, wrapt in fire, Has made me think 'twill soon be true. Prepare—prepare these arms in rust, Bring forth St George's banner red! These towers must shortly kiss the dust— He ceased—and all their joys were fled. But Clifford's noble soul was not opprest, His father's fire yet glowed within his breast; He said—“Though long in rust our arms have lain, Turn point to hilt, they spring out straight again. Now let the song of Craven knights be sung As when on Scottish shields their weapons rung.” Come forth from thy hall, gallant Lister, come forth, Let thy sons of the Ribble be armed for the north; Tell Tempest, the Borderer's standard is nigh, And the downfall of Craven's the Highlanders' cry. The shade of some bard late has been near our hall, He has sung to the winds that these turrets shall fall; But not by the Northerns, for Wharf's crystal flood Ere we yield, shall be changed to a torrent of blood. Let Hammerton mount on his high-mettled steed, And gather the horsemen of Skipton with speed; Let the Parkers below, in old Bingley's fine vale, Bring their followers cased in the brightest of mail. Brave Vavasour, rise from the oak-covered den, Blow strong thy old horn, and the best of thy men Will be cased in their armour, and as you march near Give a shout, and bold Middleton's youths will appear. Three times we have seen the great cross of our sires Destroyed as a brand in the plunderers' fires; But now we have armour, and now we will stand Till the cold grasp of death keeps the sword in each hand. Shall the pibrochs of Scotland be heard in our vale? Shall the sound of her pipers be borne on the gale? No—each one shall meet them where wild rushes wave, And, instead of rich plunder, will give them a grave. We have Eshton, as firm as the rocks where he dwells, Who has many brave youths on the edge of the fells; They will sound the war chorus till Hartlington know, And the red plumes of Craven will wave on his brow. The white rocks of Malham were never more strong Than the lines of our knights, when once cheered with a song; They need but a whisper, they all will awake, And the rocks they ride o'er with their horses will shake. Our children, our lasses, more blythe than the morn, Should we yield, they would surely insult us with scorn; Our steers and our heifers, our oxen and sheep, Would join in the mourning, and help them to weep. Where Simon, the warrior, looked down on the vale, The flag of green Craven shall wave to the gale; If once drawn our swords, the sun may go down, But they shall not return till the day is our own. By Surrey's order, o'er the mountains came The gleam of many a beacon's pointed flame. Then every knight, and every northern squire Soon knew the cause of each portentous fire. The blazing pitch on Penighent fell down, And old grey Pendle bore a fiery crown; Next Hober blazed, and its once dark brown head Shone bright with fire, till Wharf's broad vale was red: While Ingleborough, king o'er all the rest, Upreared to heaven his mighty burning crest. Then heralds mounted, and rode swift away— Through the thick wood the beacons showed the way; While those they left behind took little rest, For other thoughts filled every warrior's breast. “Our arms must be prepared,” brave Clifford cries, “And now's the time for every knight to rise!” The silver helms the noble ladies took, And made them glitter as a crystal brook, When springing from a mountain rock it runs, And seems to glitter with a thousand suns; Then on the whirling stone the swords were laid, The metal brightened of each tempered blade; And as they tried each edge with mighty stroke, Down fell the boughs from many a stubborn oak. As when the woodman, on the mountain top, Makes the green honours of the forest drop, His tempered axe grows brighter every stroke, So stood each sword, and not a blade e'er broke. Where Bolton Abbey rears its ancient head, The field, ere noon, was quickly changed to red; Brave dauntless Lister brought his hundreds there, Who well could wield the sword or sharpened spear. Pudsay and Hammerton, and Heber brought Strong lusty warriors, who as bravely fought; While Parker led his followers o'er the moor, Shouting to see their comrades were before. Though not adorned with lace of shining gold, They each could fight as Britons fought of old; Fearless of death, each bore a dauntless mind, Which priests had blessed, but learning not refined. The best old ale the Abbey could afford Was brought in plenty to the warrior's board; Wives, daughters, mothers, deep in grief were sunk, But Craven youths grew cheerful as they drunk; Told wives and lovers never more to mourn— All crowned with fame, with Clifford would return. The word was given, and as they marched along, Huzzah'd, and left old Bolton with a song: We all will bravely stand, my lord, Or where's our homes and lasses, If Scottish Jamie with his sword But once through Craven passes? Let us meet them o'er the Tweed, And fight for fame and glory; And if our men are doomed to bleed, Let Scotland's plains be gory. At every village we march through, Our numbers are increasing; And England, if we beat the foe, Will give us all her blessing. If, leagued with France, they would come down, To rob our halls and burn 'em; Like mountain sheep, when once we meet, We'll kill, or take, or turn 'em. Old Scotland's army had marched boldly forth, Crossed o'er the Borders, and laid waste the north; But dauntless Bulmer, with his little band, Retook their spoils, and drove them from the land. Eight times his numbers Bulmer met in fight, And Scots' great Hume just saved himself by flight; But, as some drops oft fall before the shower, So this but warning gave of Scotland's power: Her army, then a hundred thousand strong, Shaded the mountains as they marched along; Led by their king, their bosoms were on flame For England's downfall, plunder, and for fame. 'Twas this great Clifford from Earl Surrey heard, Then marched to meet them, nor their numbers feared. The trumpets sound, the cheerful hautboys play, As o'er the mountains Clifford leads the way; The tale goes round in mirth, while others sing, And when they halt, their bed's the purple ling; And there they slept, though not on softest down, Yet more at peace than he that wore the crown. Six days they marched o'er mountains, rivers, rills, Ere they met Percy on old Branston Hills. Percy and Howard much rejoiced to see Clifford lead up his horse and infantry; Dacres and Stanley welcomed every knight. Whose loyal men had come so far to fight. Then Surrey gave to Percy, and the lords, And those they led, these energetic words: “Howard and Dacres, Percy, Clifford, Scroop, In you is placed your country's firmest hope; Let Yorkshire knights their ancient valour show, And Durham's sons stand firm, though these be few! Sons of old Cumbria, your brave valour show, And, Westmoreland, lay many a Scotsman low! Clifford! all Craven youths I leave to thee— Fight like your fathers, yours is victory!” The eagles from Helvellyn's craggy height, Spread their broad wings, and hastened to the fight; And from the rocks which overhung Lowdore (Where in all forms the bursting cat'racts roar), Croaked the dark ravens, as they flew away, To feast at Flodden, on that bloody day. The pibrochs sound, and every kilted clan Grasped their broad claymores ere the fight began; A thousand flashes from their blades arise, Thick as the stars, when frost has cleared the skies. In shining mail, and with a steed of fire, From Barden went the noble-hearted Swire. With horse and harness rode the sons of Carr, Stout, brave, and fierce, as ever went to war. From Langcliffe rode the fiery-hearted Browne, Whose well-aimed shafts twice forty Scots struck down. Fearful at first the meeting armies close, But fear soon fled, and fierce confusion rose. Brookden and Hammond, and determined Chew, Through ranks of Scots like fiery meteors flew. Garforth and Eastburn, Currer, Shaw, and Wood, Fought till their horses' hoofs were wet with blood. All those who would describe that bloody day, Must from a task so mournful turn away. Describe till death, no living mortal can Give a true picture of each varied clan. 'Twas such a day as ne'er can be forgot While live the lines of great Sir Walter Scott. But I, an humble bard, had Flodden left, Had not great Clifford many a helmet cleft; And led a thousand warriors to the field, Stout sons of Craven, who would never yield. But Homer has such mighty battles sung, Virgil and Lucan their grand harps have strung To sing of Dido and Pharsalia's plain, That few new thoughts for humbler bards remain. To greater fancies humbly will I leave The fight where many bosoms ceased to heave. 'Twas fierce as rage could blow revengeful fire— 'Twas deadly as the grave could e'er desire; The field so gory, that the birds of prey A moment stopped, then, sated, flew away. There many a mother wandered near the field, For fear the sons of Scotia should yield. The mourning virgins see the battle's shock, Their eyes just raised o'er some adjacent rock— Trembling, when sounds of battle reach their ear, Lest some dear father should lie slaughtered there. Not like a battle where the warriors are Wounded or slain in hostile lands afar, Stretched bloody, cold, and pale, in deadly sleep, With none to close their eyes—with none to weep. Then fled the Scottish chiefs, and all was still, Save dying groans on Flodden's gory hill. Frantic among the slain the ladies ran, To seek the wounded of each varied clan. “Ochin Iro!” in Highland accents broke, When youths were found, which never more awoke; And many a Highland maid, in snowy vest, Stained it with purple on a bleeding breast, While banners of the victors waved on high, And trumpets sounded o'er the victory. The sons of Craven, anxious, marched away, To tell at home the glory of the day; Marton rejoiced, and Langcliffe youths were glad, But Halton's warriors marched but slow and sad; Few were their numbers—they had left the best Cold on the field—Smith, Burley, Shyres, and West. Garforths had fought till all their horses fell, But at their side were Tempest, Scott, and Stell, Or these four brothers had at once been slain, Nor hunted in the vale of Aire again. Hundreds of names with care great Clifford kept Of those who centuries in the dust have slept, Who fought at Flodden, by their chieftain led, Nor sheathed their swords till every foe had fled. Marton sent forth bold Arnold in his mail, Four noble Tennants fought from Longstrodale; Hawkswick and Flasby, and old Hellifield, Sent Listers, who were never known to yield. Arncliffe and Sutton of the triumph shared, For these had sons who dangers never feared; Old Giggleswick, beneath her craggy scar, Had fifty sons, who bravely fought in war. Stackhouse and Preston, with the bow and bill, Fought, with the Brayshaws, on old Flodden hill; The Summerscales, from Settle, cut their way Through files of Scots on that eventful day; And Keighley's warriors, led by Smith and Hall, Unparted fought, and made the Northerns fall. When these brave youths with Clifford marched away O'er misty mountains, till the closing day, They slept near fires of rushes, turf, and peat, One side quite cold, the other scorched with heat; Helmets their kettles, and a spear their fork, To turn the chop, the steak, or roasting pork: And who would scorn to have the supper there, With triumph, health, an appetite, and beer? When rose the sun, and crimson was the morn, While light and shade the western hills adorn, The clouds of mist slow through the valleys rolled, Tinged with the morning, like a sea of gold. As in the east the beams of light advance, Like burnished gold shines every polished lance; All faces then a joyful aspect wear, When native hills and native vales appear. The heralds soon arrived at Barden tower, And told the downfall of proud Scotland's power; The virgins dance, the aged butler sings, And Wharf's fine vale with shouts of triumph rings. All Craven knows, as swift as sounds can fly— Shout answers shout, that there's a victory! Methinks I see the ploughman leave his plough, The loyal farmer lay aside his hoe; The churn is stopped, while listening stands the maid— The aged ditcher rests upon his spade; While jocund youths, rejoicing, leave their play, Shout o'er the fields—to Barden haste away; The frugal dame, who spins, some wealth to save, Looks to the towers, and sees the banners wave. Then on the hill which overhangs the vale, First glitters Clifford's bright and shining mail; While on each head the plumes of Craven dance, A thousand flashes varying from each lance. The victors' shout is answered in the woods, And echo bears the triumph down the floods; Sweetly the mellow bells of Bolton rung, Woods, hills, and dales, in joyful concert sung. Panting, the nymphs and swains the hill ascend, To meet a lover, brother, or a friend, And many an armed head is turned aside In loving glance to his intended bride. Among the number, beautiful and fair, Was Ann of Kildwick, on the banks of Aire; The ring was bought, she bore it in her breast, And went to see her youth among the rest. The Skipton troop rode past—he was not there, The hardy sons of Wharfdale next appear; She views each helmet, and is sore afraid, But can't discern her lover's fine cockade, Formed of the ribands which once decked her head, But stained at Flodden, where her warrior bled. She asked his fate, while heaved her snowy breast— Her lover's comrade thus the maid addressed: “Anna, the worst prepare thyself to hear, Nor ever hope to see thy Henry near. We left him bleeding, and too near his heart Were the dark feathers of a Scottish dart; Hopeless, I watched him till he closed his eyes, Sunk, scarcely breathing, never more to rise. Thus was he left upon the Northern hill, His features pale—his pulse, his heart, were still.” Poets may sing of woe, and painters try To place the tear of sorrow on the eye; Poets and orators, and painters too, Would fail, though greatest—hers was Nature's woe; Such as we feel when all on earth is done, Our hopes all blasted, and all pleasures gone. Poor Anna! yet methinks I see her stand, The ring he bought her shining in her hand, And his last letter blotted o'er with tears, While on her cheeks the hectic flush appears: But 'twas not long the virgin had to mourn, Her soul soon met him over death's cold bourne; Soon did she fade, and never smiled again, But sung these verses over Henry slain: Thou purple heather, on the rocky fells, Wither and droop, and hang thy head like me! Bloom not, ye cowslips, with your honeyed bells, But fade and weep o'er Anna's misery! Ye opening daisies, every eyelid close! Ye skylarks, chaunt, but in the minor key! Ye thrushes, mourn, as if ye felt my woes— Sing, all ye birds, of Anna's misery! Thou thorn, where last we met, no blossoms bear! Thou garden, if fine flowers should bloom in thee, May pinks and roses bend with many a tear, And lilies weep o'er Anna's misery! This earth has nothing now this heart to cheer— No bliss with him but in eternity, When Henry comes, my mourning soul to cheer, And take me with him from this misery. O Henry! if thou canst on Anna wait, Or canst petition Heaven to set me free, Let my tired spirit soon regain its mate, And bid farewell to earth and misery. Oh, cruel warrior of the furious North! What had my youthful Henry done to thee, That thou shouldst send the fatal arrow forth, When on its point was Anna's misery? Could I but tell where cold in earth he lies; My youth, who helped to gain the victory! There would I weep till death had closed these eyes, And this sad heart forgot its misery. Time, spread thy wings!—I know not where he lies; Haste with my spirit to the bridal day! Come, lovely death, and close these weeping eyes! Come, Henry, bear thy Anna's soul away! Thus did she mourn and wander in the vale, Till echo learnt her melancholy tale; But few her days that mournfully she sung, Her garland soon was in the Abbey hung. The Hall of Barden now shines rich in state, Her warriors march in triumph through her gate; The ancient bard upon the rampart stands, The willing strings obey their master's hands; With eyes of rapture, loud their deeds he sings, As if his soul was living in the strings. All joined the chorus, till the neighbouring wood Echoed their song to Wharf's fine rolling flood. The song was ended—and brave Clifford sprung From his black charger, and his armour rung; The arms of Tempest answered to the sound, And spears and scabbards clashed upon the ground. Each brave foot-soldier then his arms uprears, Till in the court they form a pile of spears. The warriors enter, each a welcome guest— The brave are ever worthy of a feast; The strength of England, beef in Craven fed, The spacious horns, with foam upon each head; Ale such as slew grief, anguish, care, and woe— Such as they brewed three hundred years ago. Bereft of sons, the mothers came to mourn, For many went who never could return; The sorrowing fathers left the scene of mirth, To seek the dead, ere they were lain in earth. The harper's lyre, the victor's patriot song, The widow's grief more poignant made and strong; Music brought sorrow—triumph brought a tear— Despair still whispering, “Oh! my son's not here!” And, pale the widow stood, with grief opprest, The child, unconscious, smiling at her breast. Such are the mournful scenes the warriors see, Though triumph crowns their arms with victory; Such feasts in days gone by have often been, With bursts of joy, and mournful thoughts between— Joy for the conquest, then the solemn strain Swelled on the lyre, as dirges o'er the slain. What names extinct, and families no more, Since Craven youths the vales and hills marched o'er! Some names, who then to nothing could aspire, Are titled now with baron, knight, or squire; While those who noblest courage there displayed, Are hid in Time's impenetrable shade— Those who from Barden cheerful marched away, To reach their homes the next approaching day, When, through respect, the ladies carried far, For those they loved, the weapons used in war. One youth a quiver takes, and proudly walks, While of the battle his brave brother talks; Another in a helmet takes delight, And sore regrets he was not at the fight. Thus to their hamlet each one hastes away, To tell their kindred of the bloody day; Mothers, expectant, saw their sons return, Wept tears of joy, and there forgot to mourn. Peace and soft rural charms the warriors greet, And Scotland never more durst Craven meet. When Sabbath comes, to Bolton each repairs, And praise is followed by the fervent prayers; Warrior and yeoman, peasant, join the throng, And help to make the Jubilate strong; And hundreds went on Clifford's form to gaze, Who for the triumph gave his God the praise. O Bolton, what a change! but still thou art Noble in ruin, great in every part! When we behold thee, signs of grandeur, gone, Live on thy walls, and shine on every stone; Thy shades are lovely through each varied day, Thy rocks, thy woods, thy streams, where beauties play; Lovely, when, rosy in the east, the sun Shows the high hills the cheerful day's begun. Throughout the day, in all the hours which shine, Peace, beauty, and rich scenery are thine; But, when the evening shades, like curtains, are Thrown o'er the wheels of day's resplendent car; When the broad moon, as though she rose to see The hoary columns of antiquity; Then, solemn grandeur greets the changing queen, And Wharf's reflection helps to light the scene. At every well-selected point of view, Fresh scenes appear, as beautiful as new; There the broad river shining with the sun, And there the streams in eddying circles run: Deep roars the Strid in snow-white robe of spray, At rest below the wearied waters stay. Thus have I seen the rock-verged deep at rest, The foam, like marble, varying on its breast; The ivy bower, secure from summer's heat, For contemplation, what a blest retreat! Where the grey ruin, and each varied hill, Exceed in beauty fine descriptive skill. There may the rural poet sit and write, The learned astronomer survey the night; The love-sick lover here may sit and dream, Lulled to his slumber by the murmuring stream: But streams and woods, and waterfalls and flowers, Lovers' retreats, rich lawns, and shady bowers, Have all been sung in lovers' verse so fine, No room is left to hold another line. Muse of the sylvan shades, if yet thou dwell Amid those scenes which make my bosom swell, Descend, and to my pensive mind impart Such thoughts as thrill the breast and warm the heart; To sweetest measure tune my humble lyre, Since Bolton's groves demand the purest fire! The brave, the good, the noble warrior, now Sleeps with his fathers in the tomb below; The noble Clifford now no more can be True to his king in honest loyalty; The earl has left his helmet, sword, and shield, And rides no more, undaunted, to the field, To combat treason in its darkest form, And meet, unmoved, the Northerns' fiercest storm. Peace to the dust of those who bravely fight In honour's cause, and for their country's right; In praise of such the bard should ever sing, Whose duty tells them to defend their king; And worthy is the baron, knight, or lord, Who in his country's cause unsheathes his sword! Such lovely scenes has Wharfdale to enjoy, When war is changed to peace and rural joy; Here can the aged spend a peaceful day, Beguile sad grief, and to their Maker pray; The widow, weeping o'er departed love, Is helped to mourn by many a mourning dove; And hidden here from any mortal's ken, May weep in silence o'er the best of men, Whose cares, and joys, and sorrows, hopes, and fears, Had bound them closer through successive years. Here might the poet, Nature's “helpless child,” Whose soul is boundless, and whose thoughts are wild, Imagine things beyond the torrid zone, And how the ancient Grecian temples shone; How earth, and every orb, was formed on high, Till his full soul burst out in ecstasy: “Ye trees, ye leaves, and every varied flower, Were nothing else, ye show Eternal Power! The verdant grass on every hill that grows, The goodness of the great Creator shows! Insects and birds, that dwell amid the grove, The creeping worm, and those that soar above; All beasts, however varied their abode, Proclaim the power, the majesty of God! The shining orbs, that deck the arch of night, Orb above orb, till distance dims their light; Planets by circling motions show His skill, While others burn through ages and are still.” Grand are the heav'ns unto the feeble eye; But when the poet can the tube apply, New wonders open, and new worlds appear, Which tell the mind Infinity is there! Lost in the thought, his ardent fancy burns, He thinks—and to himself with reverence turns; His soul is filled with solemn hopes and fears, To think he's co-existent with the spheres! E'en when no more one ray of light they give, His bosom holds what must for ever live, When sun, and moon, and stars, and skies are lost, And Nature's self is to old Chaos tost! Now as the Wharf to Olicano moves, And leaves the rocky Strid and Bolton's groves, Old Castleberg, the torrent-wasted scar, Uprears his head, where Romans met in war, When on its topmost point the watch-tower stood, And deep below, beheld the rolling flood. Britons and Saxons have contended there, And on the ramparts mixed spear with spear; The warriors, tumbling headlong down the steep, Pressed with their armour, plunged into the deep: But Time, who leaves behind all earthly things, And overtakes fresh objects with his wings, Has left so far behind swift-pinioned Fame, She could not reach us with a warrior's name. Through shades of oak which have for centuries grown, Wharf winds her way to Ilkley's ancient town; No altars now unto her streams are raised, As when the Roman sacrifices blazed; Yet she rolls on, when Romans are no more, Unworshipped, hastes to mix with ocean's roar. More worthy is the mighty King of all, Who raises kingdoms, speaks—and empires fall; Who made all systems, and who formed the sun, Who spoke, and bade yon crystal fountain run, Praise to receive, and glory, power, and might, Through Time, and in the blissful realms of light! Ilkley, thy healthy mountains, wells, and air, Can cure the nervous, trembling in despair! Upon thy crags, to climb the granite rocks, And see the sportive youths pursue the fox, Would make the trembling limbs be firm again, And banish Melancholy and her train. To thee, how many on their crutches come, Soon dance without them, and run smiling home: Then to their friends in highest raptures tell How strength improved at Ilkley and its well. Here they can walk amid the valley fine, The angler into crystal throw his line, And watch the trout, though in the water deep— Behold his eyes, which ne'er are closed in sleep; Peace, Love, and Solitude near Ilkley dwell, And Health sits smiling at her mountain well: Thus did she sit, and made this vale her home, Before invading Cæsar marched from Rome. Denton, thou rural village, little known, Thou once hadst warriors who could shake a throne! When Fairfax, with a patriot feeling strong, Was led by false designing Cromwell wrong, A race courageous from thy shades arose, Who feared nor foreign nor domestic foes. In civil war, the numerous fields were red Where Fairfax fought, and where his brothers bled; But now 'tis peace, no warriors from thy hall Ride forth in armour at the trumpet's call. How blest the land, when martial days are o'er, Like those of Towton or of Marston Moor; When regal power, when law was laid aside, And Britons by the swords of Britons died! From Marston to old Tockwith spread the line Of those who fought against the royal sign; The stout right wing Sir Thomas Fairfax led, And seemed another Hector at its head; Lord Fairfax led the centre to the fray, The left, proud Cromwell's stern commands obey. Down in the plain the royal army stood, Who for their monarch soon must shed their blood; True loyalty was spread from wing to wing, And each forgave the follies of his king. Dreadful the sight, when thus two armies meet, All friendly feelings sunk beneath their feet, And those who hung upon the self-same breast, Taught by one father, by one mother blest, Waiting the signal for the deadly fray, Where brothers take their kindred's lives away! But so 'twas here, when young Prince Rupert led The right wing, brave as e'er a banner spread. While General Goring led the centre on, To meet the Scots, as oft their sires had done, Lucas and Porter often rode to cheer The wings, the centre, vanguard, and the rear; While those who marched at great Newcastle's word, Were brave as any that unsheathed the sword. Now ready stood each fierce embattled host, When all distinction in their dress was lost, When handkerchiefs, and slips of red or white, Were all that showed the king's-men whom to fight. The trumpet sounded, and the march began, Fairfax and Cromwell leading forth the van; Th' usurper cried—“For battle all prepare!” Then the arch-hypocrite breathed forth a prayer; As if Omnipotence could smile to see Britons from Britons gain a victory. While Cromwell's files marched rapid down the hill, Firm in their lines the Royalists were still; With no impetuous haste Lord Goring led— The foes appeared, but not a king's-man fled. Now front to front the hostile armies are, Each bosom feels the dread of civil war; Awful the silence—not a sound is heard Of drum, or trumpet, or commander's word, But just a solemn hum before they fire, For brothers wished from brothers to retire; And, truly, but for Cromwell's haughty pride, All had been friends, and not a warrior died. What anxious breasts were left in every hall, Lest the loved lord should in the conflict fall! The lady, often, with her children prays For Heav'n's protection in the battle's blaze. As when a thunderstorm the valley fills, The rapid rivers tumble from the hills, Falling impetuous from each rocky height, So rushed the host of Cromwell to the fight. The Royalists, though few, like ramparts stood; Or, as the sea-beat rock defies the flood, From their close-serried files no warriors fled— Their firmness struck proud Cromwell's host with dread: His legions shout, then swift the ramparts scale, And meet the Royalists with shot like hail; But when the brave young Rupert spurred his horse, The royal army burst with such a force, Their foes gave way—but Fairfax quick as thought, Wheeled round his steed, and man with man they fought. As when young lions some fierce tigers meet, With fiery eye-balls, and with gory feet, Which strive at once the royal beast to slay, And, unmolested, plunder for their prey, So came the Scots;—but Rupert, like a flood, O'erwhelmed the bold, and stained their flags with blood. As when on seas two rolling channels fight, And furious waves are turned to foaming white, Thus did they meet, swords clashing 'gainst the spears, Till Major Fairfax in the slain appears; Till not a weapon but with gore was red— So fought both wings, till great Sir Thomas fled. When Pompey fled on famed Pharsalia's plain, In such a space were fewer warriors slain. The noble Prince, whose loyalty was warm, O'erwhelmed the sons of Scotland like a storm! But see Lord Goring the firm centre lead, While firm they follow his dark prancing steed; Deep are their lines, their spears stand thick as corn, And Cromwell's musketry they meet with scorn; Close are their ranks, so thick the warriors stand, And hard the spears are grasped in ev'ry hand, Rushing like fire, or, as the lightning red, They met their foes, and Cromwell's centre fled! Again the brave Sir Thomas Fairfax turns, Meets Rupert's columns, and the battle burns. The lines are broken—muskets useless lie, Swords clash on swords, the balls no longer fly— Rage, horror, death, revenge, and wounds and blood Swelled the confusion of the battle's flood! With more determined rage no armies met, Nor earth with nobler gore was ever wet. At length, o'ercome, brave Fairfax flies again, Wounded himself, and his brave brother slain: Thus Rupert fought, though loth to take the field, Yet, when once warmed, his heart would never yield. Now victory seemed the Royalists to crown— The banners of their foes were trampled down; The noble files whom valiant Porter led, O'erwhelmed all force, and every general fled. But as the thunderstorm, when once 'tis past, Turns with a ten-fold fury on the blast, While quiv'ring in the cloud the flashes blaze, And make the boldest that they dare not gaze, So came proud Cromwell, leading on the horse, Dark as the storm—what could withstand his force? The Trojan warriors never better stood, The Grecian phalanx never was as good, As those brave men, who for their sov'reign bled, And conquered oft, when great Newcastle led! The heaviest charges of their foes they met, And each succeeding charge their foes were beat; Nor would they fly, nor would a warrior yield, Till half their numbers fell upon the field. Then, let not Cromwell of the victory boast— He need not glory that his foes had lost; For had the Prince been there, he ne'er had fled Ere Cromwell's self and half his host had bled. Methinks I hear him, when the armies cease, Speaking, deceitful, in such words as these: “Oh! why should war, why should the sword and spear, And hostile armies in the field appear? Why should the haughty pride of man destroy Youth, strength, and beauty, and a parent's joy? Has not disease itself a rapid way To turn the greatest mortals into clay, But rage, and armour, battle-axe, and fire, Against the race of mortals must conspire? The soldier at the front of battle smiles, Steps o'er the slain, to close the broken files; His fame, his honour, then his chiefest care, And little leisure has he left for prayer: A spear may pierce him, or a bullet flies Swift to his heart—the warrior falls and dies. When shall the lovely days of peace appear, That sheathes the falchion, and that breaks the spear? I praise Thee!” and much more the usurper said, Which never reached ten fathoms o'er his head; For God delights not in His creatures' pain, Nor will He hear His praise sung o'er the slain. With luckless fate, and in an evil hour, The haughty conquered, not by skill or power, But by superior numbers gained the day, While braver youths were driven far away; Youths, who their triple number often met, And fought till all their swords with gore were wet. Dacres and Lambton fell upon that day, And Slingsly's noble soul was sent away; Fenwick was lost, and Luddon was no more, And Gledhill's corpse was scarcely known for gore. Meetham, the brave, the loyal volunteer, Heaved his last breath for his loved monarch there; Then with near thirty wounds brave Graham bled, Who never in the fiercest contest fled; To Norton Hall his warriors bear him slow— Then what a scene of undescribed woe! I hear his lady's sighs—she cannot weep— Hope, love, despair, sink in her bosom deep; The bleeding stops—she hopes her lord will live, And for his life would every blessing give. Now a bright beam is lighted in his eyes, Then pale, the brave, the dauntless Graham sighs! The statues of the ancients ne'er could show Such silent grief, such eloquence of woe, As in his lady's features were exprest, When the last struggle shook her warrior's breast; When the last kiss inhaled the parting breath, And all she loved on earth was still in death! Slowly and sad the weeping servants come, With noiseless feet, and look into the room, To hear their master's voice, or once behold The features of the loyal, brave, the bold; But these no more behold his piercing eyes— The only sounds are broken-hearted sighs Of his sad widow, in wild agony, In fervent prayer, that death would set her free. Boast not, usurping Cromwell, o'er the dead— With half his wounds thy bravest knights had fled. Prince Rupert, then, whose valour ne'er would yield, Again returns, in hopes to gain the field; The firmest of his troops resolved to lie Cold on the field, or gain the victory; But not a friend they met—these all are fled, Except the wounded, dying, and the dead; While foes in thousands, stretched upon the plain, Showed e'en the noblest effort would be vain. He had a heart, and such had all his men, They'd not have shrunk to meet them one to ten; But when five hundred must engage a host, E'en Cromwell's self must own the day was lost. When in the west the sun in grief had sunk, That Marston Moor such noble blood had drunk, The troops of Cromwell had no quarters nigh, For Yorkshire then was friend to royalty. Through every line the haughty conqueror rode, Exhorting all to give the praise to God! Thanking the men who had the victory gained, When far from balls and swords the Earl Earl of Manchester. remained. He seemed to mourn the day so far was gone, That nothing for the wounded could be done; But, if they waited till the break of day, All shattered limbs should then be cut away; Balls be extracted, every wound be drest— Both friends and foes with surgeons should be blest! Then well to sup he galloped off the ground, Felt not the pain, for he received no wound: And so it is in battles, nine for ten, Leaders get praise, and victory's gained by men. The scene was awful, when the light began To shine on features gory, pale, and wan; Some, who had plundered in the shades of night, Slunk swift away, as though to shun the light. When morning, with a crimson colour, spread Her beams upon six thousand warriors dead, What would the feelings be of those who sought A son or husband, who had bravely fought? What shrieks were heard among the ghastly dead, Whilst many a widow raised her husband's head, O'erwhelmed with woe—of every hope bereft, And nothing but her starving children left! These were the scenes on Marston's gory plain, And such would be in Anarchy's proud reign. Witness old Spain, when she was stained with gore, When France sent rivers crimsoned to the shore, Till tides of ocean, bearing back her guilt, Upbraided her with all the blood she spilt; When the red bolts through Italy were hurled, And half destroyed the garden of the world; And Moscow's blaze, amid the snowy field, Ere Russia to the pride of France would yield, When Nature's self was armed with frost and snow, And slew what Russians never could lay low. When war the sword had borne through every land, No hostile feet durst ever press the sand Where rolling tides had washed old Albion's coast, Nor durst they on the seas with Nelson boast, Where Albion's waves upon the shores are broke, And her deep thunder sleeps in heart of oak! Oh! could that thunder rise into the cloud, And deepest darkness hide it like a shroud, That these might pass unnoticed through the air, And save a noble people from despair! Oh! that each mortar, and each heavy piece, Might send its thunder in defence of Greece! And Britons unto Corinth lend her aid, While Athens sees Saint George's flags displayed; Great Homer's spirit see the tyrants slain, And wish to sing of Grecian wars again; Clinton his Hector, his artillery The gods of Greece, deep thund'ring from the sky! The Turks would fly when British shot was rained, And Greeks behold what ancient Homer feigned. Oh! could we save old Grecia from her woes, For slav'ry give her triumph o'er her foes! She worships at the self-same sacred shrine, Believes that Saviour, Britain, that is thine. Where now her sculptured columns? where that tongue, In which her warriors spoke, her poets sung? All gone!—and youth gain wisdom from the land, But let it sink beneath the spoiler's hand! Europe! ye kings! could you but hear her cry, Would you withhold from Greece her liberty? Thousands of Britons feel their bosoms burn To take the dust of Athens from her urn, Throw it toward heav'n, till all her warriors see Old Corinth triumph—ev'ry Grecian free. Were great Demosthenes to speak one hour, The very slaves would scorn the Turkish power; And were the troops of old Britannia there, Crescents would fall, and Moslems disappear. O that the day would dawn that brings to thee, Land of the brave, thy ancient liberty! Then would thy bold improving language tell How Britons fought, how Turkish tyrants fell. Return, wild fancy, what is Greece to thee? Thine be the task to paint antiquity; Let Harewood's mutilated towers be sung, Grey with old Time, with sober ivy hung— Home of brave hunters, warriors, and the fair, When mirth and song, and merry dance were there. Here, in the ruins, sat the rustic bard, Whose way through life was sorrowful and hard, Still were the winds, and beautiful the night, While in a large half circle spread the light, The herald to the moon, night's modest queen, Whose waning orb soon in the east was seen. The shadows of the towers and rising wood Stretched through the vale and trembled on the flood; But as she rose, the trembling shades withdrew, And showed the silv'ry Wharf broad in the view; With wand'ring weary, tired with study deep, The poet's eyes were soon seal'd fast in sleep. He dreamt of airy praise, of empty fame, And to his fancy ancient Hist'ry came; A mural crown was placed upon her head, A link-mail cuirass o'er her breast was spread, A belt of silver'd silk around her waist, From end to end with Saxon verses graced; Saxo-Monastic words were on her vest— The cross was ruby that adorned her breast; A scroll of ancient parchment there she spread, While to the poet's fancy thus she said: “Take courage, youth, and I will give to thee These dark-writ pages of antiquity; Here are the records of these ancient towers— No mortals fear, but try thy utmost powers. Each passage read, nor o'er thy weakness mourn, Strike thy wild harp, and soon will I return: Let bold heroic measures be thy strain, Sing on, nor think thy song will be in vain. Take up thy harp—why is it thus unstrung? 'Tis thou must sing of deeds which ne'er were sung!” The bard arose, as sweet she tuned his strings, Then swiftly spread abroad her airy wings; The moonbeams glitter'd on her robes of light, But quick as lightning was the transient sight. When he beheld the Saxon language there, To him 'twas sealed—he sighed, and dropped a tear. Awhile next day he in his grot reposed, Then in despair the ancient records closed; Anon, these words, borne on the wings of air, Came softly whispering—“Never yet despair; Why do these records fill thy breast with pain; The latter will the former part explain. There's not a bard that here his harp has strung, But every verse is there, that e'er he sung; There's not a tale of love, or lady fair, But all their sorrows are in verses there:— Nature attends, thy bosom to inspire, And in thy bosom is a spark of fire, That spite of coldest ice or frozen snow They heap upon it, brighter yet will glow.” He heard no more, but many a leaf he turned, When soon his lightened heart with rapture burned. The poet's muse had led him to the foam Which is the sculpture o'er the sailor's tomb; Where rolling thunder forms the sable cloud, Which wraps the sinking vessel like a shroud, Mocks the dread roaring of the raging deep, When wild despair forbids the sailors weep. There did he sing, as though he saw the storm, Its varying terrors rage in every form. He saw great Ætna to the clouds aspire, Which seemed to set the arch of night on fire; While on each hand the boiling waves appear Red with the light, as if the flames were there. Scylla below, the thunders from above, Volcanoes bellowing till the mountains move; As if great Jove had called his mighty choir, And touched the strings with his tremendous fire. He reads the verse the ancient scroll contains, These fall as soft as sun-reflecting rains, When the fine arch is spread for miles each way, And not a breeze disturbs the showers of May: So soft the ancient bard his harp had played, That to his verses listened many a maid; He sung the dream of Mary on the hill, Which showed the secrets of a lady's will. “How soft, how cheerful, sound yon bells Within my native vale; And every tone sweet echo tells, That flies along the dale! And thus, my Henry, shall they sound When we together join, And Hymen has our wishes crowned, And thou art ever mine. Contentment, hov'ring on his wings, Shall at the wedding be; And viols, with their tuneful strings, Shall trill sweet harmony. The hautboy and the shepherd's flute, Shall breathe a joyful air; The dulcimer and mellow lute, Shall swell the octaves there. The nymphs, and all the cheerful Nine, Unseen shall each inspire; While Bacchus brings the choicest wine, And Vesta lights the fire. The virgins, with their tresses bound By many a wreath of flowers, Shall wish their youths, like mine, were found, And all their bliss like ours. The world that day may roll away; But all, so blest with love, Shall scarcely know the eve from day, Nor think the moments move.” Thus thought the maid—'twas truth she spoke, As she in raptures slept; But, disappointed, when she woke, That all was air—she wept. Far weightier strains next tremble on the lyre, Strains which the coldest bosoms would inspire! 'Twas on the evening of a hunting day, The bard rehearsed the deeds of an affray, Of which the warriors to their children spoke— What lords were slain, what ladies' hearts were broke, When two great hosts marched forth with sword and shield, And met in conflict on old Towton's field. The Earl of March, Plantagenet's true heir, From Pont'fract came, and all his host was there; At Ferrybridge the great Fitzwalter stood, The pass to guard o'er Aire's fine rolling flood. Northumberland and Clifford knew the plan, And Somerset, the brave, the loyal man, Led on his files—but fierce and short the fray— Fitzwalter fell before the break of day: High as the battlements were heaped the slain, And few could meet at Pontefract again. To Edward's camp the noble Warwick rode, Then drew his sword, long, shining, sharp and broad, Vowed from his monarch he would never part, Then plunged the weapon to his charger's heart; Which showed that for his monarch and his right, On foot great Warwick never feared to fight. Edward proclaimed, “Does any soldier fear? Let such return, nor spread infection here; March forth, ye brave, whose souls with valour burn, Cowards, fall back, and you that fear return! All you who fight, and me, your king, regard, Shall each one find a bountiful reward: But should a coward, when we meet in fight, Turn from the foe, to save himself by flight, Whoever shall such trembling dastard slay, Shall be promoted when we gain the day.” When morn first broke, dark, stormy, and unclear, To Towton's plain all Edward's host are near; Wild, gloomy, red, the awful morning came, As though the east was painted o'er with flame: Upon the western hills, in ev'ry form, Hung the dark clouds, and hail was in the storm. It was the Sabbath broke upon the plain, Where Henry's sixty thousand host had lain; Not in warm tents, but on the damp cold ground— Thousands of warriors sleeping there were found; While others watched to feed with wood the fires, And on the plain were seen unnumbered spires Of quiv'ring flames, high crowned with azure smoke— Such was the scene when first the morning broke. The chiefs, each mounting on his prancing steed, Rode forth amid the youths that soon must bleed. A finer band of warriors never lay Upon the plain, for war to sweep away; Nor truer youths than Edward's ever found, To guard, in war, the monarch these had crowned. The trumpeters were ordered then to blow, And every warrior that was sleeping low, Stretched his strong limbs, half stiffened by the frost, And many a soldier had all feelings lost, And there had died, had not some good old wine Warmed their cold bosoms ere they formed the line. They rose—but not to dress, for that was done— No hasty buckling of their armour on; No sharpening of the battle-axe and spear— All this was done before the host marched there. Grand was the martial sight on Towton's plain! A sight which England ne'er may see again. Stars on a thousand breasts, gems on their swords— In Henry's cause had armed a thousand lords; His was no common cause—the king was crowned— Thousands of youths for him lay on the ground. Arrows were useless in the dreadful fray— 'Twas sword to sword on that eventful day. The river, soon retarded by the slain, Stood like a lake, and deluged half the plain. How little thought the pious peasants near, That York and Lancaster contended there! At Saxton church the rustic peasants met, When these returned, the willows all were wet With noble blood—astonished there they stand— Thousands are bleeding there on either hand. Now with the fire of battle, Swords, and shields, and helmets ring; Dreadful was the deadly rattle— Either host fought for a king! Red with blood the warriors' feet, Shattered many a brazen shield; Again they turn!—again they meet! Death stamps his name upon the field. Northumberland, with burning breast, Leading his warriors at their head; Each line, each squadron thus address'd: “See, nearly half our foes are dead! Forward, ye brave! the day is ours; Forward, and fiercely fight the foe!” But darts and arrows came in showers, And laid the mighty leader low. Now the charge—now the flame Burning in each warrior's heart; Each forgot, or life, or fame, Scorned the sword, the spear, the dart. Wave the red rose and the white, Ranks are broken, rage is king; Mingled, man with man they fight— Lost the centre, and each wing. Beaumont falls—a thousand more Fight around the corse of Grey; Ev'ry face is red with gore— Death is sated with his prey. Raging comes the furious storm, Either host is lost in snow; Rage so fierce—no line can form— In the drifts are thousands low! White the storm falls from the sky; When upon the plain 'tis spread, Soon 'tis changed with gory dye, Swords, and snow, and fields are red. Now the centre meets the wing; Clash the swords, and break the spears; Now the targe—the helmets ring, Death in every form appears; Limbs are lost, and heads are cleft, Thousands fall to rise no more: Oh! what widows then were left, With their helpless orphans poor! Now they fly, and now they turn, By the battle's fury driv'n; All their breasts with anger burn— Death with every blow is giv'n! Now the last effort of King Henry's host Was such as warlike Britons never met, Upon the plain they twenty thousand lost, And those that fled, before were never beat. The red rose fell before Prince Edward's force; And when the storm was o'er, and clear the sky, Of Henry's host was neither foot nor horse— Terror, confusion, panic, made them fly. Now evening came, and sorrow's darkest shade Shrouded the lovely features of the fair; Cold in their gore near forty thousand laid, And many a brave young warrior was there. Then ladies' cheeks were wet with many a tear, And for their souls' release the Friars prayed; All England mourned—e'en those that gained the fight, Sighed o'er the slain, so awful was the sight! Thousands of helmets, lances, swords, and spears, Arrows, and breast-plates, and unnumbered shields, Each stained with gore among the slain appears, And richest gems are spread upon the fields. At such a sight the stoutest bosom yields, And eyes that seldom weep are wet with tears; Dreadful the day, when Towton's wide-stretched plain Groaned with the mighty burden of the slain! The widows wept—but women soon forget Their former husbands, when in dust they're lain; Their cheeks with tears a month or two are wet, But love within their bosoms lights again: They reason thus—“We live not by the slain; These ne'er return, though widows we remain:” This did the bard observe through wasting years, And placed but little faith in woman's tears. Sad was the morning of the mournful day, When relatives the dead and dying found; Some from the field were lifeless borne away, The rest promiscuous hurried to the ground. And many—far from their loved place of birth, By hands of foes were tumbled into earth. To lighter strains the bard his harp now strung, For he too much of bloody scenes had sung. Regret not, dear ladies, the fate of the brave, Who fight for the king and the fair; A halo of glory encircles their grave, And fame wets each corse with a tear! They feared not the trumpet, the bugle, or drum, The banners or swords of their foes; But their watchword was, “Let all our enemies come, We soon will each phalanx enclose!” Their armour was bright when they rode forth at morn; Their spirits were never dismayed; The spears on the shoulders of warriors were borne, And high were the banners displayed. The strains of the trumpets were, “Edward, our king!” The song was, “Long life to the brave!” And next I could hear the young warriors sing, “For vict'ry, or death and the grave!” Then weep not, dear ladies, your lords are asleep, All peaceful they know not your cares; Drive anguish away, 'tis too late now to weep, For their spirits departed in pray'rs. To Harewood Castle gallant Lisle returns— No more with anxious grief his lady mourns; His noble friends in brilliant armour shine, And drown the terrors of the day in wine. While York's strong gates were opened to their king, And sounds of conquest swelled from ev'ry string, High blazed the torches on the lofty towers, And swiftly flew the glad triumphant hours; And many a day, in festive mirth and glee, Spent the brave knights o'er Edward's victory. At length the dance, and love's soft joys gave place To nobler sport—the pleasures of the chase. From Harewood Castle, at the break of day, With horse and hounds the knights rode swift away. The top of Almus cliff was red With cheerful beams of morn; The sun upraised his golden head, When echo heard the horn. The hounds into the valley ran; The fox his cover broke; The sounds cheer'd every sportive man— The hills—the valleys spoke. Across the plain he took his way, The hounds in music sung; There ne'er was such a hunting day Since Rugimont was young. At Arthington the stream he took— The hounds, the horses near, Crossed the broad river like a brook— They all were hunters there. To Kirkby Hill they see him fly As rapid as the wind; The hounds pursue in tuneful cry, With horsemen close behind. The nuns of Arthington beheld The glories of the chase, And almost wished to quit the veil, Though modest was each face. As swift the fox runs o'er the hills, And close behind the hounds, Borne on the winds the echo swells The ever-varying sounds. From Rugimont the sportive Lisle Rode on the fleetest horse; No hedge nor river, gate nor stile, Could stop his hunter's course. Dreadnought and Ranger led the pack, And Hector ran the third; Next Skilful sung, and deep-mouthed Jack— Such sounds were never heard. To Riffas Wood sly Reynard hies, The best of hounds pursue; The notes into a chorus rise— All have him in the view! In vain he runs—he turns in vain From hunters, hounds, and steeds; He struggles hard the rock to gain, But at its foot he bleeds. The dying fox seized many a hound, While struggling hard for breath; The gallant Lisle arrived the first, And shouted at the death. The hunters wished that he had gained His hold amid the rocks, For Wharfdale never yet contained For sport a better fox. Then lord and baron, knight and banneret, In honest true old English friendship met, Returned to Harewood, talking of the chase, And pleasure shone on every noble face: For nothing drives old wrath so far away As such a chase as these had seen that day. No city's pomp, no pampered courtier's pride Yields satisfaction like the sportive ride, When the whole mind in hunting takes delight, And Pleasure greets returning Health at night. Songs of the chase that evening were not sung,— To strains like these the minstrel's harp was strung: The fields have been red where the battle was burning, The horse, man, and leader have fallen so fast, That the joys of the fair have been changed into mourning, But such a dread carnage is surely the last. To the floor of the hall let the ladies bring flowers— At rest is the battle-axe, bow, and the quiver; The enemy's fled, and the victory's ours, And peace shall reside in our valley for ever. This night we rejoice not that thousands are wounded; No music shall sound o'er the myriads that fell, Ere Edward's shrill trumpet the victory sounded, And soldiers did actions no language can tell. They may sing of famed Cressy, where warriors did wonders, When the clang of their arms to the skies did ascend, But war sends not forth its most terrible thunders, Till, raging, fierce Britons with Britons contend. Then bursts in wild fury the lightning of battle; The clash of the sword, of the lance, and the targe, Are borne on the wind, and the horrible rattle Swells louder and louder, as quicker they charge! Let time throw a veil o'er the dark scene of terrors Depicted in gore on the breast of the plain, And wine drown the sad recollection of horrors That stalked in all forms on the field of the slain. Then rose the bard, his harp aside was lain, And gravely spoke in this prophetic strain: “These towers shall fall, and bury deep in earth The floors where once was seen the dance of mirth; But there shall rise a mansion richer far, When England rests secure from civil war, Whose lords shall be respected by their kings; And here shall other minstrels touch the strings. Below shall patriotic troops appear, Led by commanders to the monarch dear; True British valour firmly shall unite The throne to guard, and every Briton's right. A finer dance, a richer sight shall be, Than all thy ancient masks and revelry; A better chase, when these the fox pursue, And fleeter hounds than ever Redman knew Shall cross the hills, and in the valleys sing, Till woods and vales with cheerful echo ring. But what are all the trifling things of earth, The highest pleasures, or the greatest mirth, The fairest scenes, where ev'ry beauty is, And all that can compose terrestrial bliss, The love of sport, the finest dance or song? All quickly fade, and cannot please us long. The short-lived pleasures which this earth affords, To poorest paupers or the greatest lords, Are all but shadows, or like passing showers, Transient their sweetness as night-blowing flowers; While Virtue is more lasting than the sun, And pleasure yields when earthly joys are gone.” THE POACHER: A TALE FROM REAL LIFE. “The receiver is as bad as the thief.” —Old Proverb. This subject wants no Muse the breast t' inspire, Deep learning,—nor the Apollonian lyre; Fine tropes and figures here can nought avail, 'Tis but a plain and simple rustic tale,— A tale of poachers, partridge, grouse, and hares, Gamekeepers' acts, their dangers and their fears; And who the persons that are most to blame, Or those who buy, or those who steal the game. But in description little is my pow'r,— I never took a hare at midnight hour; Experience cannot teach me how to sing,— My shot ne'er broke the pheasant's glossy wing: No partridge in my hands, resigned its breath, Nor moor-cock closed its beauteous eyes in death; For when I found them young upon the bent, Far from their nests in sympathy I went. Though low the theme, yet lords it has engaged, And famous knights have oft at poachers raged. They act such deeds as make e'en barons swear, Break down their fine park walls and take the deer; In every hedge suspend the murd'ring snares, And from their best preserves fetch bags of hares. Nor is it strange—a child may know the cause Why daring poachers break the nation's law; When for one night they gain far more reward Than for a week of honest labour hard. Game laws, they think, are made by greedy elves, Who want the free-created game themselves; The partridge, snipe, and grouse, for aught they know, Belong to them just equal with the crow. The youthful poacher first a terrier keeps, And where the conies haunt oft slily creeps, Till one is caught,—and then the foolish boy Is elevated with a ruinous joy. His parents chide not, nor his actions blame, But praise his skill, and gladly take the game. Growing in vice, such implements he gets As powder, shot, a fowling-piece, and nets. His parents then too late their follies see, Pass days of grief, and nights of misery! Absent from home—he ranges far and wide, His comrades are his ruin and his pride; Daily they spend the money they obtain; Half drunk at night they sally forth again: Dangers on ev'ry side they heedless scorn, If they with hares and pheasants can return! Ignotus was a man who work could get, Had he not more than working loved his net; On the brown fallow he the grain could throw, Could use a flail, a sickle, scythe, or hoe; To rustic youths he had no cause to yield, A better workman seldom took the field; Had not his failing been the death of hares, Keeping a dog, and making nets and snares. An old experienced poacher, nearly done, Who scarce could walk, yet gloried in the fun, Learnt him to call, and how to temper wire, With rushes, straw, or shavings set on fire; Told him what money on a night he made, When he was young, and fewer of the trade; An evening long he lengthened out his tale, Spoke of his feasts on spirits, beef, and ale, Then praised the persons who had bought his hares,— Forgot his wants, his mis'ries, and his cares! Though old, infirm, and racked with many a pain, He almost wished to pass such nights again! When sportsmen some notorious poachers fine, On game at taverns they should never dine, For fear it was their own the week before, Hung in their parks, or shot upon the moor! But here we scarce can tavern-keepers blame— They wish to have a wide extended fame; And but for poachers, what could such men do, When for a feast they want a hare or two? If there be supper, or a private ball, Be there no game, it does not please at all; The beaux and belles go home dissatisfied With ev'ry dainty, roasted, baked, or fried. The ladies blame the master of the house, If in the feast there be nor snipes nor grouse; For that is ever held the choicest dish, That comes in secret, be it game or fish! The ladies then in ecstasy declare What part they took of partridge, grouse, or hare; Describe the dainties when they each get home, But ne'er consider how those dainties come: For whether poachers steal from 'squires or kings, This is the cause whence most of poaching springs. The epicures of ev'ry trading town, Who get a hare or pheasant for a crown, Have done more harm than all the murd'ring wire That e'er was tempered in the poacher's fire. The bards of genius sing the orphan's woe, The rise of nations, or their overthrow; Others describe the shipwrecked sailor's fate, The terrors of th' ensanguined field relate.— Mine be the task to paint unto the life, The deep distress of a poor poacher's wife, Who in the worst of huts is forced to live Where winter snow comes through it like a sieve; The furniture, were it put up for sale, Would scarcely make a crown to buy him ale; His children to the utmost famine driv'n, Quite destitute of clothes but what were giv'n By one whose heart could at misfortunes melt, Who knew their wants, and for their suff'rings felt. He sees them shiv'ring oft without a fire, And what should buy them coals is spent in wire; Two-thirds laid out in powder, shot, and nets, The other part the well-fed landlord gets,— And when the night of danger's passed away, While others work, he sleeps throughout the day: But oft his sleep is broke by sudden fears, He starts,—and thinks some bailiff's voice he hears,— He lifts his head,—'tis famine all and dearth, His famished children clinging round the hearth; Disease destroying all his partner's charms, And tears fall on the infant in her arms. His conscience wakes, though nearly hard as stone— He turns him o'er, and heaves a heavy groan; Vows like an honest man's his days shall be— At last convinc'd his deeds bring misery. His weeping wife hears the repentant sighs, In anguish t'ward him turns her tear-drenched eyes, Thus speaks, with looks that would the marble move, While weeping o'er the pledges of their love: “Thou once dear youth, for whom I all forsook, “To me and mine, O give one thoughtful look! “Where shall we fly?—our credit all is o'er, “Thy evil deeds have made and keep us poor. “My mother, wearied out, no more can do, “My father's bosom wasting with his woe! “Thou, while at enmity with ev'ry friend, “Dost only to the worst advice attend. “Bring thou but constant wages, I could rest, “And with a certain pittance should be blest. “While others sit in plenty and at peace, “As years roll on their nuptial joys increase. “Here is our eldest and our only son, “Who blessed us first ere sorrow had begun, “Without a shoe to travel in the snow, “By rags defended when the cold winds blow; “Who knows not yet an alphabet or pray'r, “Nor ever yet engrossed a father's care. “Such things as these sink in my bosom deep, “And hours unseen I sorrowing sit and weep. “And see those little innocents beside, “More than half naked, while clothes are washed and dried. “While other children are with raiment blessed, “And twice upon a Sabbath day are dressed, “Ours stand aloof, upon the holy day, “Or weep, upbraided with their rags at play. “Debts undischarged, while thou enjoy'st thy cheer, “Forgetful of the wants and sorrows here. “How well could we be clothed,—how well be fed, “If like an honest man's thy life was led; “O that the purchasers of game could know “My children's wants—the burden of my woe!” While thus she spoke, his nightly comrade came, Extensive orders he had got for game, From a rich man in whom they could confide, Theander, whom the poachers long had tried. To those who bought his goods he presents made Of hares and pheasants, yet he ne'er betrayed The youths who brought them from the distant wood, And risked their lives to bear them o'er the flood! Then to the distant parks with steps of haste, They cheerful crossed the wide-extended waste. The moon's resplendent orb was hung on high, Though hid were half the diamonds of the sky; While skimming clouds, borne on the wings of air, Shrouded the heav'ns, excepting here and there The moonbeams darted through a misty veil, And fields of light fled swiftly o'er the dale. Two dogs attended them across the moor,— A double-barrelled gun each poacher bore: The hares were feeding on the turnips green, But Wharf's broad stream rolled rapidly between,— So deep the ford, it scarcely could be crossed, They greatly fear'd their journey would be lost. But soon they found the horse they oft had tried, Which ne'er refused to cross the torrent wide; Without a bridle to adorn his head, The peaceful creature by his mane was led. A while they on the brink consulting stood, Then mounted both, and ventured at the flood. The stream was rolling rapid, deep, and strong,— Yet in the midst, they hummed the poacher's song, To kill their fears; for who could help but fear? Broad was the river, and the whirlpool near. The aged horse, his oft-tried strength now lost, And on the rapid stream they both were tossed! Their homes the poachers ne'er had reached again, Had not Ignotus grappled fast the mane; Desparo seized his friend—'twas all he could, And thus, half drowned, they ferried o'er the flood. Upon the bank they search the ball and string, And in the oil-case wrapped, they quickly bring Across the stream their implements of sport, And with them to the farmer's house resort. The frugal, aged dame is filled with fear, Lest some should say they harboured poachers there. Her son—a sporting youth, then goes and draws A jug of ale—regardless of the laws: Then vows,—nor lord, nor lease, his sport shall stop, Since hares and pheasants ruin half the crop! He rouses then the fire, piles on the peat, And soon the poachers' clothes smoke with the heat. The aged farmer, grieved, with locks turned grey, Sighs in his chair, and wishes them away; Then hobbling on his crutch he ventures out, To listen if the keepers are about; While down his furrowed cheeks the tears run fast, Afraid with him that year will be the last. His landlord angry,—now no hope appears; But his good farm, possessed for forty years, He soon must quit, ere his few days are gone, Through the bad actions of a wicked son. With eyes suffused with tears, the poor old man To reason with his son then thus began: “O that I could persuade thee to give o'er “This cruel sport, which makes and keeps us poor! “Would'st thou but honestly attempt to live, “My little all to thee I'd freely give: “But now each field, untilled, neglected lies; “Thy flail the beasts with fodder scarce supplies. “While thou art ranging with thy nets and gun, “Our cattle and our farm to ruin run; “Among thy comrades all that little spent “Which should have paid my long arrears of rent. “Nothing but deepest anguish is my lot; “I would have lived at this my native spot, “Where I so many years of labour passed, “And where I first drew breath, have breathed my last! “But now, the workhouse”—here his anguish strong, O'ercame his soul, and sorrow bound his tongue! The hardened poachers could not help but think; But soon they took the quart, and swore “Let's drink!” Ignotus vowed that was no time for fears, The 'squire must have his score of living hares. The rich Theander, grown by commerce great, Had purchased with his wealth a wide estate; Then down came ev'ry hedge, and ev'ry wall, And ev'ry humble cot was doomed to fall. Upon the rising hill each plan was drawn, Of villa, gardens, grove, and sweeping lawn; And planted were the trees of ev'ry hue, The oak, the ash, the sycamore, and yew; The fir, the larch, and plants not native here, The poplar, with its waving leaves, was there. The rills collected, formed a lake for trout,— And who that has a park would be without? With the high fence the whole was circled round, But in the modern park no hares were found; No pheasants in the new plantation bred, Nor partridge chirruped its young brood to bed. But what's the villa, garden, or park wall, Except the hares are frisking round them all? What pleasure in the grove and cooling breeze, Except the pheasants glitter in the trees? The partridge whirring from beneath our feet, In our own grounds, is surely pleasure sweet! So thought Theander,—who from poachers bought With cheerful heart, all living game they brought. But stop, my pen—O let it not be said That great Theander would have bought them dead! The poachers, with their nets, their dogs, and gun, Directed truly by the farmer's son, Then left the house, and hastened to the wood; In silence there a while they list'ning stood, Just when the hammer of the village bell Twelve times heaved back, the midnight hour to tell. Then Nature such an awful silence kept— The faded leaves on lofty poplars slept; The withered rushes on the heathy hill Were scarcely moved—the tallest pines were still. The waning moon a bloody vesture wore, The only sounds the distant cataract's roar, And deep-mouthed mastiffs, struggling in the chain, Fierce barking to their echoed noise again. This solemn scene no deep impression made On hearts of flint, so hardened with the trade. Then through the thick-grown briers they wandered slow, Looking for pheasants on each lofty bough. Ignotus swore they would not fire that night, Till they beheld between them and the light Ten glist'ning birds within the trees at rest; For oft before they numbered many a nest, And when the powder flashed, and shot had flown, Dried sticks and leaves were all that tumbled down. The number in the wood was quickly found; They left them there, and ranged the open ground. That night the poachers did their utmost strive To catch the rich Theander hares alive. Then swiftly round the fields the lurchers went, Dogs which were silent on the strongest scent: And when the flying hare was just before, Their feet were heard, their panting, but no more. But fatal for poor Stormer was the night, Two lusty keepers saw him in the flight, Levelled their pieces at the vital part, And shot poor faithful Stormer through the heart; While Phillis swift, the fleeting hare pursued, And left her partner struggling in his blood. The echoing woods conveyed the swift report,— The poachers guessed the end of that night's sport. Then quickly sounded Stormer's dying cries,— Rage filled each breast, and blazed within their eyes; Ignotus swore, “This luckless night I'll die, “Ere Stormer, wounded, on the field shall lie; “And should a legion of gamekeepers come, “The shot of both my barrels shall fly home!” Weak and more weak the cries of Stormer grew, As to the fatal place the poachers flew; And, when arrived, Ignotus raised his head, Then heaved a sigh, and deeply swore, “He's dead! “O friend, Desparo! such a dog ne'er went “Across the fields, for swiftness or for scent. “Poor Stormer! look, Desparo, where he bled!— “How oft to us he has the hares conveyed! “How oft have I, with exultation great, “Stood list'ning to the singing of his feet; “But now his turnings of the hares are o'er, “And he must pant close at their heels no more!” No sooner had these words escaped his tongue, Than four armed keepers, lusty, stout, and strong, Leaped from the bushes with the full design To make these bold marauders pay the fine. O'er Stormer's death their bosoms were enraged; In desperation, one with two engaged. Around the poachers many a pellet flew, Before in war they either trigger drew; Then all at once their double barrels went; The shot whizzed past,—its force in air was spent; No time to load again,—they met in blows, The poachers struggling with superior foes. His piece Ignotus by the barrel took, One adversary's arm in splinters broke; He groaned and fled, his piteous case to tell; Another stroke,—and strong Ignotus fell! While bold Desparo, with his strong butt-end, Made his antagonist to earth descend. Now two disabled, furious was the fray, Both sides were stupid, neither would give way, The barrels broken from their carved stocks, And on the field were strewed the torn-off locks. Enraged, Ignotus rose, and drew his knife, And cried, “Desparo's freedom or your life!” The keepers, dreading much the fatal blow, Took to their heels, and let the poachers go, And where the 'squire who can such keepers blame? They fought, 'tis true,—but who would die for game? Next night, of game Desparo made a feast, And every well-known brother was a guest. Not to the ale-house did the group retire, But drank and smoked around the poacher's fire: Pheasants and grouse, and Stormer's last-caught hare,— Domestic fowls, unbought, were roasted there. Their liqour, home-brewed ale, and smuggled rum; And each was armed had the excisemen come; But these as soon durst fierce banditti meet, As force their way into the lone retreat! The supper ended, what a jovial crew! Each showed his nets, of those they had not few. From friend to friend the cheering bumpers ran, The viol tuned, the merry dance began. O that some greater bard had present been, And touched with verse burlesque the festive scene! Their tattered clothes were such as might have graced Some farmer's scarecrow in a wheat field placed: Thus doth misconduct bring the richest down, And clothe with rags the poacher and the clown. Ducando was a man of careful heart, He seldom paid a sixpence for his quart; To sip the smuggled drops was his delight,— With such a group he spent the jovial night. The keeper of the neighbouring 'squire was there, Enjoyed the sport, and drowned all his care. Inspired by drink, who can be silent long? The poachers could not, but began their song SONG. Come all ye brethren of the night, Who range the mountain, wood, and vale, And in the moonshine chase delight, May our true friendship never fail! Then drink around, Your cares confound, Ye champions of the wire; The field—the moor, Will we range o'er, Nor care for lord nor 'squire. The parliament such youths as we With laws may strive to bind; But they as soon in cords might tie The lightnings or the wind! By Cynthia's beams, We cross the streams, To fetch the game away; Then here we rest, With bumpers blessed, And banish fears away. So long as planets rise and set, Or tim'rous hares can run, The poacher true will hang his net, And level sure his gun; The high park wall, Spring guns and all, And keepers strong with beer, We value not, Nor shun the spot, If hares are frisking there. The lord upon the hunting day Such pleasures never knew, When echo bore the sounds away,— The hounds—the fox in view; As when the hares Are caught in pairs, Upon the glitt'ring frost! Should we be fined, What need we mind, Since others pay the cost? What stop we at the rivers deep, The frost or winter's snow; The lazy keepers soundly sleep, When tempests wildly blow. Of rain and hail, Let Jove's great pail Be emptied from on high; The darker night, The more delight, And greater numbers die! The song was ended;—and Ignotus drew The plan of ev'ry distant park he knew; Described each gateway where he hung the net, And ev'ry hedge, where oft his wire he set; Marked out the fish-ponds, and the river's flood, The pheasants' haunts, and where the villa stood. “Upon this spot,” said he, “one stormy night, “When darkest clouds obscured the moon's pale light, “I stood alone, while Stormer ranged the plain, “And five strong hares within my net were slain! “And here the place where I my tackling hide “When lusty keepers press on ev'ry side; “And here, within the wood, the lonely dell, “Where oft I fired, and sleeping pheasants fell. “Here stands the tree to which the cord is tied, “And there my game across the river ride; “Then I the bridge securely travel o'er, “And none take oath that murdered game I bore.” The junior poachers silent sit and gaze, And give with joy the senior poacher praise. T' increase their sport, upon this festive night, These bungling verses did a rhymer write: “The poachers on the heath, the fields, the wood, Or where the shining fishes cleave the flood, Against the laws will yet pursue their sport, And to the parks of distant lords resort, Though half their incomes were to keepers paid, Though traps were set, and ev'ry scheme were laid,— The poachers, heedless of the fine or shame, In spite of all would sometimes steal the game. Then those that would such things in safety keep, Must catch, and couple them like straying sheep: And lords who would make property of game, Cut short their wings—like poultry keep them tame. For 'tis a truth, and let it once be known, A poacher's shot's oft surer than your own.” They laughed—they shouted—when the rhymer ceased, (For fools, half drunk, with feeblest verse are pleased). Then four strong keepers burst the shattered door, And stood well armed upon the dirty floor. Desparo and Ignotus forced their way; The rest, o'erpowered, were captives forced to stay. Game, newly killed, was in the cellar found, Snares, pack-thread, guns, and nets were spread around: The poachers, mournful, left their lawless sport, To meet the dreadful audit of a court. Desparo and Ignotus knew their cares, Supplied their wants, and killed the 'squire his hares; Death and destruction through his grounds were spread, Till scarce a leveret on the clover fed. With sorrows worn, and ebbing fast her life, Unhelped, unheeded, lay the poacher's wife! He spent his days in revelry and mirth; While she, too weak to give her infant birth, O'ercome with grief, and of her suff'ring tired, Neglected, starved, and pitiless, expired! No husband there, her fading eyes to close,— Confess his guilt, though author of her woes. When he was told the period of her pain, He smiled, and had the tankard filled again! Untouched with sorrow, anguish, or remorse, One tear he never dropped upon her corse. He left his home the two succeeding nights, To make expenses for the fun'ral rites. His starving children o'er their mother mourned,— A neighbouring peasant o'er the infant yearned, In pity took and nursed it as her own,— And sure such deeds are worthy of renown. Loosed from his wife, with whom he jarring lived, His children bread through charity received. One night he spent where lies famed Robin Hood, The next where Harewood's ancient castle stood; The beauteous vale of Wharf he wandered o'er,— Expecting wealth, but still was always poor. What he in dangers got at taverns went, Or in rich treats was on his comrades spent. Read this, ye rich,—who stolen game receive, And think how wretchedly the poachers live: Far from your feasts prohibit lawless game, Caught in disgrace,—and purchas'd too with shame! Ye rustic plunderers, who sport by night, And fearlessly invade another's right, Cold winds and storms your frame will soon impair, Your robust limbs will soon in sickness wear; Though firm your sinews as the hardest steel, Your constitution must your follies feel: The sport, the bowl, the glass, the cheering quart, Soon, soon will fail to animate the heart. Ye who purloin by night the harmless game, Ere youth is past, old age shall rack your frame. No days well spent can you look back to view, At last convinced this axiom is true,— “If injured lords no punishment prepared, “Drinking and poaching bring their own reward.” On lost Ignotus' fate a moment gaze, Who in his cups oft gained the drunkard's praise; He swiftly hasted with his pilfered load The bridge to shun and oft-frequented road. Beneath a sheet of ice the river slept, Half o'er its course the thoughtless poacher stepped, Around his feet the yielding crystal bends, And dreadful in a spreading circle rends! He heard—he trembled,—but it was too late, The ice gave way, and locked him up with fate. Till morning came his faithful lurcher stopped,— Howled near the chasm through which his master dropped. His frantic children viewed the fatal cleft, Though injured,—their affection still was left; Their grief,—their woe,—can never be expressed,— Imagination must depict the rest. His corse, though sought, was never brought to land, But somewhere lies deep shrouded in the sand! His neighbours wept not, though he ne'er returned, And for his loss his children only mourned. No distant parks but ev'ry shade he knew, From whence at morn the waking pheasants flew; The lonely streams where speckled fishes played, And where the hares upon the mountains fed. The dark brown heath, upon the trackless moor, With dog and gun he often travell'd o'er; In winter's frost, upon some rocky spot, He called the list'ning grouse within his shot, Then on his upraised knee he levelled true,— The trigger pulled,—the moor-cock never flew: But now—the hares may feed, the fishes play, The pheasants sleep upon the lofty spray; The grouse, secure, may in the rushes rest, The speckled pairs of partridge form their nest; The keepers now their watchings may give o'er, Ignotus, prince of poachers, is no more! ELWOOD AND ELVINA. PART I. When York and Lancaster, enraged, Contended for the crown, And brothers furiously engaged To cut their kindred down; The flags with roses white and red, Waved wildly on the gale, And many a noble warrior laid Deep wounded, cold, and pale. Then devastation, fierce and dread, Ran frantic in the field, And rage uplifted ev'ry arm, As all refused to yield. Then did young Elwood first appear, A valiant noble knight, With cuirass, helmet, shield, and spear, Well armed for the fight. Upon his sable foaming steed He gallantly could ride, And with his sword, at swiftest speed, The leaden ball divide. The fierce black troop of Craven horse, Was Elwood's to command, And they were dauntless youths as took The sword or spear in hand. Each warrior, in a coat of mail, Like mighty Hector stood, The lion couchant on each helm, With feet deep dyed in blood. Upon their shields the eagle spread Its wings extended far, And underneath its talons laid The implements of war. Caparisoned in links of wire, The sable chargers pranced; Their nostrils smoked, their eyes were fire, As they impatient danced To the shrill trumpet's piercing sound; And from the silvered rein, Tossed in the air the foam around, While prancing o'er the plain. Firm as their native rocks the line,— The terror of their foes; And on their breastplates bright did shine, In polished steel, the rose. Such was the troop young Elwood led, From his old castle strong, Where the fair partner of his bed Was praised in ev'ry song. Sprung from an ancient line was she, Young, handsome, chaste, and fair; The richest glow of modesty In all her blushes were. Whene'er he led his warriors o'er The hills, to watch the foe, She numbered ev'ry lengthened hour, And thought the moments slow. Upon the tow'r she often stood, His horse's hoofs to hear; And often thought the field of blood, With all its terrors, near; Or thought she heard the trumpet shrill Re-echo down the streams, Or saw their armour on the hill Reflect the lurid beams. Each foot she heard approach the hall, Struck terror to her breast; She thought the news of Elwood's fall Was in the sounds expressed. Thus she, in tears, with many a sigh, Upon the tow'r would wait, And when she heard her warrior nigh, Run swiftly to the gate. Glad beat her heart when she beheld, By torches burning bright, The shining eagle on his shield Reflect the varying light. She crossed her breast, her hands she raised, Too happy then to mourn; With joyful heart the Virgin praised, For Elwood's safe return. Young Reginald, a noble knight, Rode on his charger there; And on a steed of purest white, Sat Agatha the fair. Great Reginald's loved sister she, From famed Romilli sprung; And oft in rural minstrelsy Was this chaste beauty sung. Behind, in brilliant armour dressed, The noble troop advanced, The moonbeams glittered on each crest, And on their armour danced. Elvina's friends, a lovely train, Stood waiting for the brave; Welcomed their kindred back again, Nor found one left a slave. In some wild ancient warlike air, The instruments combined; The sounds re-echoing all around, In imitation joined. The warriors from their horses sprung, To join the evening's sport, Their heavy, clanging armour rung Around the spacious court. The neighing steeds pranced loftily, To martial music sweet, And sparks of fire like lightning flew, Beneath the chargers' feet. And soon the feast the heroes graced, Renowned in deed and word: No foreign dainties then were placed Upon a warrior's board. Around the room the arms were hung, Of ancient warriors bold: The native bards their battles sung, And all their actions told. There was the armour Percy bore, On the contested field; His sword hung there, all rusted o'er, And there his mighty shield. There helms and breastplates, black with age, Where many a shaft had broke, And there an ancient coat of mail, Deep marked with many a stroke. Old banners, which the Scottish chiefs Had in the battles borne, By sword, by battle-axe, and spears, Were into tatters torn. No wainscot then adorned the hall, Nor various coloured paint, But on the cornice, rudely carved, The head of many a saint. Crosses and holy reliques rare, Above the arms did shine, Which ancient knights had brought with care From distant Palestine. The table was of marble white, No fine-wrought cloth was there; And sappling cans, all polished bright, Contained the sparkling beer. Next came the wine and festive joys, As Elwood led the dance, And thoughtless of his piercing eyes, To Agatha did glance. Elvina saw,—and deeply felt Passions unknown before; And from that night her peace, her joy, And nuptial bliss were o'er. The dancing ceased, the song began, As bards swept o'er the lyre; And nectar from each sappling can, Did ev'ry breast inspire. Soft sounded first the sweetest chords, And love was in the song: The music, suited to the words, Ran smooth and soft along. As when upon the Æolian strings The summer zephyrs play, And sylvan echoes, on their wings, The cadence bear away. But when to bolder music turned, Then glowed the martial fire; And every breast with valour burned, As glory swept the lyre! They sung their noble fathers' words, Spoke with their dying breath; The warriors vowed, and drew their swords, They would avenge their death. The bards beheld their frantic rage, The song half finish'd stopp'd; The swords uplifted to engage, Were in an instant dropp'd. Such pow'r had ancient bards to raise The passions in the breast, Or with the magic of their lays, To soothe them into rest. PART II. But when appeared the rosy morn, It showed their haughty foes; They knew them by their horses grey, And by the crimson rose. “To horse!—to horse!” brave Elwood cried, His warriors heard the words; “To horse!” the neighbouring woods replied, As they buckled on their swords. The ladies wept, and wild despair Marked with a deadly white, The face of ev'ry beauteous fair, That loved a noble knight. But, nor despair, nor sighs, nor tears, Could make the warriors stay; The trumpet sounds—the foe appears,— And glory leads the way! Then Elwood, with his little band, Undaunted, brave, and bold, Met in the battle, hand to hand, His numbers three times told. In the first charge, like brazen walls, The hostile warriors stood: Though swords are broke, no warrior falls, Nor stains the earth with blood. But when again the warriors met, So furious was the fray,— The field of death with gore was wet, Where foes and kindred lay! The plumes from Elwood's helmet fell, With one gigantic stroke; But at his foe he aimed so well, His sable helmet broke. Lifeless he fell—the Yorkists saw The blood stream through his crest; Then death succeeded ev'ry blow, And vict'ry fired each breast! Nor less enraged the adverse side, For, as the earth they pressed, They gave a death-blow ere they died Through many a charger's breast. Though thrice surrounded by their foes, Yet thrice they cut their way, And thrice they charged o'er the place, Where horse and rider lay. The red rose dropped—away they fled!— No sons of York pursued; For when they saw such numbers dead, Their fury was subdued. Dreadful to hear the piercing cries Of youth who firm had stood, Death making dim their sparkling eyes, And drinking fast their blood! Each, when the helmets were removed, Beheld relations near, And old acquaintance whom they loved, Or brother wounded there. Brave Reginald gave this command, When ev'ry foe had fled: “The wounded to my castle bear, “And lay in earth the dead.” Her absent lord Elvina mourned; Her breast was filled with fear; Her love to deepest torture turned,— Suspense and wild despair. She thought she saw Agatha smile, And then she heard her sigh; Then thought her gallant warrior false, Yet had no reason why. She called for food, but could not taste, Nor had she pow'r to drink; But often to the rock-edged flood She wandered wild to think. Her shadow in the deep below, Presented to her sight Features deep marked with grief and woe, And changed to deadly white. But night approached,—a night of storms,— Elvina's bosom beat; Love conjured up a thousand forms, And showed the lovers met. She thought she heard her Elwood say,— “Oh! were Elvina cold, “Agatha should appear more gay, “In brilliant gems and gold!” Her cloak she took, and wrapped it round A breast surcharged with pain, Regardless of the thunder's sound, The lightnings, wind, and rain. The boughs upon the lofty oaks Creaked with the tempest blast; And white with foam the rapid burn, O'er which Elvina passed. Ashamed to tell her grief and pain,— The anguish which she felt; But firm resolved the tow'rs to gain, Where her fair rival dwelt. She hasted on the slipp'ry way, Her warrior lord to meet, Resolving at the gates to stay To hear the charger's feet. And if she saw him turn aside At the suspected gate, Death from her dagger's point should leap, And on her rival wait. The thunder deep, still louder grew, Within a darker cloud, The storm across the zenith threw, As though 'twas Nature's shroud. And for a torch amid the gloom, To make the scene more dread, The lightnings burst in ev'ry form Around Elvina's head. The tempest was too fierce to last, And soon the winds were still; But the red lightning often flashed High o'er the eastern hill; Which showed the castle's tow'rs in view, And the ancient abbey near, The statues, tombs, and sable yew,— The residence of fear. But not a fear Elvina felt, Even in the darkest shade, For from the tyrant, Jealousy, All softer passions fled, When first she trod the Roman way, She met a solemn train, And pale upon the litters lay The corses of the slain. A small dim torch a mourner bore, To light them to the grave, And faint the light it just shed o'er The features of the brave. Elvina stood, and trembling shook, From her eyes gushed forth the tear, As she to the last warrior spoke, And asked—“Is Elwood here?” He turn'd around with looks of ire, And not a word expressed, Nor told her if the bloody bier Her noble Elwood pressed. The rattling of the chargers' feet, Advancing, next she hears; Hope, joy, and grief together meet, Contending for her tears. Weeping, the castle's gate she gained, With yew-trees shaded round; But there she stood not long concealed, Ere she heard the trumpet's sound. As down the deep and rocky vale The piercing echoes fly, She hears they are the joyful sounds Of Elwood's victory. The ladies from the castle came, And Agatha was there; But, innocent, she felt no shame, Nor thought Elvina near. The warriors were with trophies hung, And many a silver shield Against the brazen scabbards rung, Brought from the gory field. A day of sports it should have been; But when their foes they met, To war was changed the sportive scene,— The field with gore was wet. Brave Reginald received a wound, And, in the rear, asleep, They bear him, weak—his warriors round, Walk slowly on, and weep. When Agatha young Elwood saw, “Where's Reginald?” she cried, “Doth he lie bleeding on the field?— “Oh!—tell me how he died!” “Your brother lives—all may be well:” He spoke it with a sigh; And, swooning, to the earth she fell, As they bore her brother by. Though victory crowned the hard-fought day, Yet dear that victory cost; For, in the well-contested fight, They many a warrior lost. But Reginald revives again,— His hand to Elwood gives; And each reviving heart is glad That the wounded warrior lives. Spontaneous bursts the loud huzza! The castle walls resound; Though Reginald could scarcely join, He waved his helmet round. “Farewell!” he then to Elwood said, “I know you cannot stay, “You must inform Elvina fair, “Of this eventful day.” Then Elwood, turning from his friend, Wished him a peaceful night, And soon was hid in the dark shade, Far from the torches' light. Elvina takes a nearer way, Ashamed of jealous care, She hopes to gain the castle tow'r, Before her lord be there. But as she walked the dubious way, Along the rocky height, A misty cloud enwraps her round, And makes a two-fold night. A light appears—at which she aims, But fatal was its glow; From the high precipice she drops, Among the rocks below! No weeping virgins round her stood, No faithful husband near,— No hand to stop the streaming blood, Nor priest to hear her pray'r. Until the peasant passing by, Who bore the fatal light, Beholds her in the cliff below By her jewels glitt'ring bright. For help he heard her faintly cry, In plaintive tones of woe, But scarce could hear her feeble voice, For the rapid brook below. Then down the rocks he swiftly passed, To give his utmost aid; He found her wounds were streaming fast, While fervently she prayed. Then he unto the castle hastes, The fatal news to bear; But words could never yet express The grief and anguish there. They mourn the lady good and fair, The best of womankind,— One single fault alone she had, And that a jealous mind. Oh! what a piteous sight it was, When Elwood saw her dead! Distraction seized his noble mind, And hope and reason fled. They laid her in the ancient tomb; The priests were filled with fear, Lest she had shortened much her days, They scarce would read a pray'r. Brave Elwood there no more could stay, But took his sword and shield; And with his warriors rode away, To seek th' embattled field. He in the dreadful conflict fought, On Hexham's bloody plain; And when for him his warriors sought, They found him 'mongst the slain. GENIUS AND INTEMPERANCE. Death and Disease my solemn muses be; Throw o'er my soul a sickbed's canopy; Let Sorrow dictate every mournful line, And, true Repentance, let the strains be thine! Tears wet the page, while falling like the rain, O'er my two friends by wine untimely slain. Their mothers met, their fathers friendly were, Before their infant eyes could drop a tear; And when they felt the first of earthly joys, When first they toddled, oft exchanging toys, Plucked in each other's gardens flowers they chose, And smiled together, when they knew not woes. How oft their parents talked of future times, And prayed that they might e'er be clear from crimes, Pleased to behold them in a garment new, And loved them better as they older grew! Young Philo joined them—then the happy three In pleasure lived, and knew not misery. Far on the hills, amid the purple bloom Of honeyed heath, they talked of bliss to come; Then bathed amid the mountain's crystal spring, Blithe as the trout that skims with finny wing. A thousand sports were there to make them blest, The happiest moments when the heath they pressed; When the wild lapwing, or the grey curlew, Screaming around their heads in circles flew, And moorhens, rolling o'er the bent and heath, To save their little broods from instant death; But when the cruel youths once came too nigh, They spread their wings, and showed they yet could fly: An emblem these of joys seen just before, We grasp in hope, they fly, and are no more. Oft in mischievous sport these took delight, And made the sable evening clouds be bright With fiery turf, with heath, and brackens dry. The heath soon blazed, and seemed to light the sky; As if some great volcano there had been, And blushed the clouds as they beheld the scene. Philo would talk of Ida's mighty flame, When blazed the woods, and liquid iron came; Compare it then to Ætna in his mirth, And spoke of Herculaneum swept from earth; Then talk of great Vesuvius' mighty blaze, And wished that he could on its terrors gaze. The furious flames now to a circle spread A mile around, and tinged the smoke with red: Then came the besom-makers with a shout, And with their besoms strove to dash it out; Singed with the flames, they could not heat abide, For they with brooms as soon had stopped the tide. The ling was deep, and old and strong the bed, Dry was the night—the flames in fury spread To such extent, that nought could stop their force, Till not a branch of heath was in their course. Where first the fire began the youths were lain, Vowing they ne'er would fire the heath again. Their other fires some acres swept away, This blackened many hundreds ere 'twas day: An emblem this of drink—we take a quart, Perhaps some spirits, ere from friends we part, And then another glass, perhaps the same, Till folly spreads into a foolish flame. My tale must pass o'er years, with all their joys,— They spent their lives in play, like other boys. Young Philo was to learning most inclined, But Amphorus to music turned his mind. Paros, a lovely youth, within his breast Of mortal feeling surely had the best. He never mis'ry saw, but shed a tear, He had no friends, but loved them far too dear; Believed all flatterers were such as he, So honest, man's deceit he could not see. The evening sun of summer seldom set, But these three youths in purest friendship met, Talked till the light was faded in the sky, Or listened Amphorus' wild melody. Sometimes young Philo struggling with his theme, An evening from his comrades would redeem; His mind expanded as his knowledge grew, And learning's every step more pleasant grew. He saw the hidden stores of Grecian lore— Each draught he took but made him thirst for more. Amphorus said, “For nought on earth I'll live “But those sweet pleasures harmony can give; “Whate'er my kindred leave me shall be spent “On music, and the noble instrument “Which brings the skylark's note, or the deep tone “Which shakes foundations of the firmest stone. “The viol's varied tones I yet will know, “The harp's, from whence soft melody can flow; “Each varied part my bosom shall inspire, “Of lively concerts, or the solemn choir; “And marches for the army I'll compose, “Such as shall sound when Britain meets her foes. “The music of the ancient school I'll learn, “And where the solemn chords of dirges mourn; “Mozart, Von Weber, in each varied flight “I'll follow, till I catch their notes at sight.” Young Paros, smiling, looked on Nature's face, And with his eye her outlines he could trace; In youth he begged for colours to be bought, To place upon the canvas what he thought. With practice now he can in shades portray The varied tints of soft departing day, Touch the rich landscape with such light and shade, That many thought the pencilled objects played. The youths and virgins, in the bowers of love, Were so like nature, that they seemed to move. Whene'er the landscape was by Paros shown, The varied trees and every shrub were known. Send Paros where you would, in every place His lively eyes were fixed on Nature's face; But such his application for a name, Deep study shook at last his tender frame, And for his health, and for the art he loved, From Cumbria's scenes to Paris he removed. Pleased with the paintings where the masters shone, He gazed upon them as a chiselled stone Formed to a statue; so engaged his mind, He thought not then of Nature's scenes behind; But when the time arrived that he must part, The thoughts of Grasmere rushed upon his heart. No scenes in Paris gave him such delight As he had found upon Helvellyn's height, Where o'er its top the eagle soars on high, And round its rocks the croaking ravens fly. Grandeur may be at Paris in fine forms, But not tremendous, like great Skiddaw's storms. Walk Paris round, and view its beauties o'er, What are its fountains to the grand Lowdore, Where, dashing from the dreadful chasm on high, The cataract seems as rushing from the sky? These Paros saw—retiring in despair, He durst not try such grandeur as was there. Oft he beheld the mist from Derwent lake Slow curling to the hills in many a flake, And as the morning sun sent forth his rays, The scene was far above the greatest praise; Such there is seen when not a zephyr blows, When the pure lake upon its surface shows Skiddaw inverted, and the cliffs on high— Fit scenes to wake the noblest minstrelsy. Oft Paros viewed the yellow orb of night, When rising on the lake with golden light, Her shadow dancing like a sheet of flame, And with the scene soft Meditation came. Beneath the oaks, and opposite Lowdore, Oft Paros sat, and heard its torrent roar, Sketching the trembling waves, when Keswick's bell Hummed through the valley with a solemn swell. The hills returned the sound with weakened power, And told the artist 'twas the midnight hour. He thought upon the peace he left behind— The thoughts of Ellen pressed upon his mind; Ellen, that ever was to Paros true, At Grasmere dwelt, where waves the solemn yew. Oft had he led her up Helvellyn's height, Her cheeks like roses, and her gown as white As is the snow where British eagles yell, Upon the mighty rocks where Goothë fell. When in the Louvre and the Champ de Mars, He thought of France and all her bloody wars, With all the arts,—to Paros these gave pain, While admiration mingled with disdain, To think what noble works to France were brought, The noblest statues, by great sculptors wrought, When thousands fell, and from the sacred shrine Such works were torn as, France, were never thine; While the great artists slept within the tomb, By study hastened to an early home, Their paintings such as wet the eyes with tears, With by-past actions of a thousand years,— Adam and Eve, the flaming sword behind, So well portrayed, it seemed as if the wind Bended the flames, or as Eve's flowing hair Waved with the blast of vengeance that was there,— The Saviour dead—before the sheet was thrown O'er Him that made all worlds, and wears the crown. Great is the imitation!—but I shrink That greatest artists ever dared to think To paint the Saviour, giver of all bliss,— Raphael ne'er could form a face like His, Could he have seen how fair in death He slept— The hardest heart that viewed it would have wept. These things are nothing to the present theme; Paros believed his Saviour would redeem Poets and painters, though they wildly roved, For genius sure in heaven must be beloved. Through France and Switzerland the artist ranged, Where fruitful scenes to Alpine mountains changed; Then viewed them all with inexpressed delight, Scenes rich by day, or grander still by night. As on the Alps the avalanches rise, Hills of eternal winter pierce the skies. He climbed their sides, with perseverance true, Till kingdoms on each side were in his view. Arrived at Rome, his young and eager mind With works of ev'ry master was refined. What there he saw, what artists can behold, To tell, might make this humble tale seem cold: But he returned again to Cumbria's fells, To Derwentwater and to Grasmere's dells; Then his rich neighbours flocked around to hear How well he liked at Rome, what paintings he saw there. He said, De Urban's lively canvas spoke, And Raphael's pencil ev'ry passion woke; Carracci's masterpiece would make you weep,— He knew so well what would his paintings keep, That on each face you'd think old Nature played, And Life seemed dancing in the light and shade: But would not any trav'ller seem a fool To tell the masters of each varied school? Paros beheld their works, and thought them fine, But Paros drank, in France, too deep of wine: For he who once was well content with beer, Must now have spirits, his weak heart to cheer; Then he could tell what he had seen away, Live in high life, and ne'er have aught to pay. Is there an arrow for the eagle's breast? Is there a shot to pierce the raven's nest? Is there for mortals any earthly curse? There's nothing to a genius that is worse. Hundreds have spirits sent unto the tomb, And made for youth the grave an early home. Death's the dire consequence of drinking deep, Then children, widow, and relations weep. So 'twas with Paros—he could paint the form Of wild despair, when struggling with the storm Sketch the wild anguish of a vessel's crew, Their bowsprit lost, and but her masts in view Paint well the billows, that they seemed to roll, And with his pow'rful pencil freeze the soul. Nature was in his strokes, and every touch Was neither yet too little nor too much; Secure in his imagination's might, Nature his pencil guided, and 'twas right. Upraised to fame, his company was sought, And likenesses he sketched as if they thought; So well he touched the portrait of the fair, She seemed to breathe, as life herself was there, The battle piece of Prestonpans he took,— The scene the noble mind of Paros woke. An ancient song, with fire in every line, Gave the first sketches of the great design; These were the words that fired his feeling heart, And told how madly Stuart played his part: “The flashing claymores gleam afar, And small the files in distance are, Each helmet glitters like a star, As clansmen are advancing. The trenches dug are broad and deep, In which the loaded cannon sleep— Silent their guns the terrors keep, To wait the Scotch artillery. Behind the hill the fight began, Death came with ev'ry kilted clan, And down fell many a Southern man, The pipers sounding victory. They yet remembered Glencoe's vale, And sent their bullets thick as hail, And with the broadswords cut the mail, And met the slaughter dreadfully. Now rages discord—man and steed Rush to the charge—they fall, they bleed— Forgot is many a noble deed, The battle burns so terribly. Each cannonier, with charge in hand, And others with the blazing brand, Close to the heated cannon stand, The smoke ascending rapidly. The steeds, that left the foam behind, The pennons, streaming in the wind, And Scots, that scorned a coward's mind, Rushed to the onset gallantly. The English, loyal and more true, The thistle scorned, and firmer grew, As closer pressed the bonnets blue, Inspired with Highland minstrelsy. The smoke, the blaze, the charge, the fire, The ranks that fall ere these retire, And England's banner lifted higher, Were grandeur and sublimity. Then darkness comes—the blaze is seen At distance, and long time between Each flash, which through the day had been From cannon quick as musketry. What Scotland won soon Scotland lost; Culloden all the glory tost To the cold shades, and there the frost Nipped her sharp thistle cruelly. Brave Gardner!—in death he lay; A better never lost the day, Nor nobler spirit fled away To realms of blest eternity. The banners now must wave no more, The dreadful conflict now is o'er, And Scotland shall be clear from gore, For discord's lost in amity.” On the broad canvas Paros had portrayed The varying glances of each shining blade, Left all descriptive poetry behind, And stamped at once the battle on the mind; But close beside him was the bottle hung— He drank when faint, then painted as he sung; But when the cheering draught had lost its head, His pencil shook, and all his fancy fled. When warmed with wine, his airy thoughts brought home The paintings, statues, and the scenes of Rome; Columns of ev'ry order, laid on earth, Where Desolation frolicked in her mirth; All Nature rolled before his strong ideas— The land, the skies, the cities, and the seas: But soon his pulses in quick motions beat, His ruined appetite enjoys no meat, His frame decays, the mind is weaker made, He starts in dreams—his bosom's sore afraid, No pleasure can his weeping Anna give; To him 'tis now no happiness to live; He values not the bubble of a name, Nor prides himself in vain posthumous fame. When his bright eyes grew dim, and fancy fled, Bound to the confines of a dying bed, The pleasing landscape could no longer cheer; His mind was weak, his dissolution near, When his pale cheek was laid on Anna's breast, And his cold hand by her he loved was pressed. What weeping then!—no language now can tell How tears were rained when such a genius fell. Then was destroyed a gen'rous noble mind, While the destroyer lurked in shades behind. Dreadful Intemperance! thy tempting snare Holds while thou slayest, O father of Despair! There lay the artist, ready for the tomb, His valued paintings hung around the room; Here the old ruin, and the shades below Spread where the crystal streams of Eden flow, And there the copy of the ocean storm, From Powell's, with the waves in ev'ry form. Oh! the sad sight—'twas solemn there to tread, To view his works, and see the artist dead. How placid he appeared!—he seemed asleep— I wept, and all his portraits seemed to weep. It was the last farewell—he could not hear— His eyes were closed in peace, and not a tear Wet his pale cheek—he panted not for breath, But outshone life, as calm he lay in death. His spirit's fled, his hand is still, His pencils now are useless laid, No more to sketch the vale or hill, No more to touch the light and shade. Let violets bloom where he is lain! Ye flowers, stay late upon his tomb! He ne'er can paint your tints again— True genius now has left its home. Relations wept, and Anna deeply sighed, For Anna, had he lived, had been his bride; But all their weeping was an empty show, Compared to Philo's “eloquence of woe.” When Philo entered, not a word he spoke— The feelings of the friend and poet woke; Thoughts flew across his fancy, wild and deep, When Paros' eyes were sealed in endless sleep. He thought upon the soul of genius fled, Words burst in sorrow while young Philo said— “Where is the spirit gone? Could such a mind Vanish in air, and leave but clay behind? Could matter think? could dust through systems roll? No—'twas the spirit fled without control. Sceptics, come blush, who think the soul is air— Look on his corpse when there's no spirit there. The mind that once was kept by genius bright, I knew in innocence, when, day or night, Joy plumed its wings: Oh, happiest days on earth! When pleasure changed from purest joy to mirth, From mirth to rural bliss, from that to sleep, When health was good—we knew not how to weep. His mind for ever stretched in fancy strong, He soared too high on earth to tarry long: But language fails, while thus my bosom swells— I soon shall find where Paros' spirit dwells; Then shall unnumbered worlds, and all things new, Beyond the reach of mortals, burst upon our view.” Through Nature Philo's lively fancy flew, He something of each varied science knew; He read of Polar wonders with delight, And searched each cause on which the learned write, He learned to know how little mortals know Of things above, or meanest things below, That when the northern dancing streamers fly, They cannot tell how these can light the sky; He learned to know that men of wit and thought, With greatest learning, scarce have learned ought. Philo the works of navigators read, That round the globe the bending canvas spread; He knew by reading what each clime brought forth, Between New Zealand and the cold Cape North. Astronomy he loved—his soul flew far, Through all the systems, to the Polar star, Nor rested there—he struggled to explain The cause of tides that roll upon the main. Greek was his glory, Homer's verse he knew, His mind through Æschylus with pleasure flew; He read each passage, soft, sublime, and strong, From great Euripides to Sappho's song; His mind was learning's self, for such as he, That love to learn, grasp at infinity. The microscopic beauties they behold, Where atom insects seem as tinged with gold, Trees, plants, and birds, and all that is or was, In quick succession through their fancies pass, And every language, vulgar or refined, Are nothing to express the scholar's mind. Philo in study passed his years away, Ere he was led to college far astray. There, with all aids, the dissipated youth Fly from the paths of rectitude and truth; The greatest learning sometimes turns a curse, At every step the human heart grows worse, Though these can have the globes, the map, the chart, And every help of Nature and of Art,— Old vellum manuscripts of Runic lore, And those which ancient Romans scribbled o'er. From Egypt curiosities are brought, Perhaps two thousand years since these were wrought, Parchment from Athens, papyrus from Rome, Where Learning had a palace for her home. Language is now at college which was spoke When Britons groaned beneath the Saxon yoke. All that three thousand years can now supply, Are spread before the youthful scholar's eye; However dark the works, they there can gain Others that will the darkest parts explain. But Philo, taught by many a pompous guide, For Nature's scenes and his own closet sighed. Sorrow, he found, with learning must increase— All chances there, but still he wanted peace, And sighed for solitude beneath some hill, Where at its foot runs swift the moorland rill, The blossomed bough, the birds upon each spray, Chanting their vespers to departing day, Where bounding trouts within the brook arise, When winds are still, and sporting are the flies. Such rural pleasures Philo then could please, And nought on earth can equal joys like these. No pleasure half so near the joys above, As he experienced when he met his love, True as Leander, she as Hero true, Bliss most refined, the greatest e'er he knew. Kings have not more, and riches cannot give Such bliss as when in innocence we live. Within the valley Philo had a friend, With whom he many a happy hour could spend, His greatest glory was to make him blest— He lent the youth all volumes he possessed. Here Philo, happy, passed his hours away, Ere wine had led his tow'ring soul astray. He read of battles, and the sons of Jove, Of mystic rites, and of the scenes of love. In learning's happy hours the youth was blest, Till love's strong passion raged within his breast; Then lost was peace, and Homer's noble fire Was quenched amid the fervour of desire; Forgot the things below, the orbs above, His tow'ring spirit was subdued by love. She that had vowed to love him while away, Bless him at eve, and think on him by day, Like woman, to be rid of anxious pain, Forsook young Philo for a vulgar swain. Then fell the genius—Philo's love was scorned, In silent grief the foolish scholar mourned, Cobwebs were seen among his modern books, And Care had stamped her image on his looks. What tuneful Virgil? or what Homer then? What all the writings of the wisest men? What all the greatest literature of earth? What all his studies?—all are nothing worth. French and Italian, Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Served but the anguish of his soul to speak. His loving heart beat fast with anguish wrung, And thus, in tuneful Greek, the scholar sung: “What is the consummation of desire, The scholar's learning, or the poet's fire? What pleasures from the greatest knowledge flow? Learning is oft the cause of deepest woe. The peasants may admire the learned youth; But did the poor unlettered know the truth, How fine their feelings, how their lives are spent, They then would sing, enjoying true content. The learn'd may search in ancient books for years, And read till not a novelty appears, These cannot Nature from the bosom move, No—more they know, the stronger is their love; And women, oh! I write it with a tear, Soon lose affection when you are not there. Oh, angel forms! Heaven's masterpiece on earth! Sources of pain, the fount of joy and mirth! Destroyers of dark grief, the cause of woe! But why be blamed, since Nature made you so? Sometimes as true as Sol's returning rays, But oft as fickle as the meteor's blaze.” Now Philo's years amount to twenty-one, And he a learned youth, a hopeful son; His lyre he tuned, and love was in its sounds, And he sole master of three thousand pounds. As when the rider, on the grassy plain, The useless bridle thrown upon the mane, The curb of wisdom thus did Philo throw, Resolved all passions of mankind to know. A sable velvet coat he first had made, And o'er his breast the shot-belt was displayed; With spaniels and swift greyhounds Philo ranged, As fancy led, so his amusements changed; Each night at parties, at the course next day, And thus the hours of Philo passed away: Or when the horn proclaimed the cheerful chase, Philo was there, with pleasure on his face. At concert, play, the masquerade, or ball, With learning, mirth, and wit he outshone all, No thoughts of feeble age, or future days— His soaring mind was ever drunk with praise. His gay companions now with him would go, And view the far-famed field of Waterloo; Provided well with gold, they bade farewell Each to his fair, and saw the ocean swell. When in the strongest gale, upon the prow Young Philo stood, and watched the waves below, Whose foaming tops were whitened o'er with spray, And tossed the vessel as she ploughed her way; With heart undaunted he beheld the tide— His mind rejoiced to see the vessel ride, Her head amid the waves, her stern on high, And then her bowsprit pointing to the sky; One hand was firmly grasped around the line, The other held a quart of purple wine. Serene, he viewed the waves in every form, And vowed 'twas wine inspired him in the storm: For firm he stood, and saw the vessel plough Through hills of seas, his friends all sick below. The tempest ceased, the winds retired to rest, The bark skimmed smoothly o'er the ocean's breast. On deck the sea-sick passengers appeared, By Philo and the sailors loudly cheered. The youth had seen the well-built vessel roll, The sight had warmed his genius, fired his soul; The lightning's flash, the thunder, and the sea Had raised his mind to noblest ecstasy. The sails were full, and, leaning on her side, Swiftly she cuts her passage through the tide, And soon the land is seen in distance blue— The level shores of Belgium they view. The music sounds, the wines like water run, When mirth upon the vessel is begun, The captain joins, and there the spirits shine, The choicest brandy, and the best of wine, And soon they hailed a vessel which they knew,— The captain from the steerage quickly threw A cask of Hollands—with the best 'twas stored— The sailors shouted when 'twas heaved on board. Then discord rose, and every sailor drunk— Three fell astern, and in the ocean sunk. The boat was lowered, but mirth and joy were o'er, They fell-but from that fall they rose no more, Till the rough billows brought each corpse to land, And left them nearly buried in the sand. Arrived upon the hill where armies fought, Young Philo's soul was all absorbed in thought; The place where thousands lay interred was seen, And there the grass waved with a deeper green. He thus reflected: “What a stillness here! Low the Hussar, and cold the Cuirassier; The meeting armies shout not on the field, Nor fall by thousands, each too firm to yield; The close-wedged squares of British troops are gone, Now still the place where Europe's peace was won; Mute are the bugle and the trumpet's calls, Yet here the plough shall find the bones and balls, And here the spade shall turn up many a scull, And broken arms, of which the fields are full.” In thoughtful contemplation Philo gazed, And saw the spot where Hugomont had blazed; He thought what thousands fell when that was fired, Then, with a sigh, from Mount Saint Jean retired. At Belle Alliance, at the close of day, The blithe companions drove their cares away; Inspired with brandy, Philo's muse awoke, And in extempore verses thus he spoke: “Low laid in yon mountain the hero, the brave, The Prussian, the Frenchman, and Scot, And the young British warrior's no more than a slave, He now as a slave is forgot. The pride of the battle to ashes are turned, And dim their once war-beaming eyes; The boldest, that rushed where the hot battle burned, Fell quickly, but never to rise. And this is their glory—they stand as a mark, Firm, braving the bullets, for fame; They flash, like the meteor, they fall, and 'tis dark— To them all the blaze of a name.” With thirst of knowledge Philo's bosom burns, And his unsettled thoughts to Paris turns; But the young muse had formed her thorny nest, Sweetly perfumed, within his youthful breast. Here he resolved to make remarks as true As life itself, on every passing view. His books he spurned, and open threw his mind To read the spacious volumes of mankind; He saw that youths might read, and yet be fools, Full of the modern jargon of the schools; But he resolved the varied scenes to see, From beggars' cots to sceptred royalty. First at Brussels he told his tale of woe, As though his arm was lost at Waterloo; His empty sleeve hung dangling at his side— In Anglo-French he told how comrades died. At night, what varied scenes were in his view, Mixed with the beggars and the gipsies' crew! Their mournful tales were changed to mirth and glee, And mendicants all joined in harmony. When Philo saw their mirth and fun begin, A louis d'or he gave to purchase gin. All instruments were tuned that then were there, And punch and music drowned all their care; Patches from eyes were torn, which then could see, And good box organs grinded melody. Philo without its mask deception saw, Amid the motley group, that laughed at law. Escaped from prison, one, disguised, was there, Another was a wounded privateer; And there was one her infant's blood had spilt, That Hollands deeply drank, to drown her guilt. Mirth still prevailed, and tuned the viols' strings— Grief, Care, and Sorrow spread their drowsy wings, And flew away—such sportive glee and fun As few behold, by gipsies were begun. Then young and old could sit not on the bench, But danced—Italians, Germans, Dutch, and French. Upon the earthen floor the wooden peg Kept as true time as many a better leg. To cheer young Philo's heart, and mend the scene, Up rose three youthful gipsies, scarce eighteen; One touched the sweet guitar, and with a smile The other danced, in true Italian style; Chords from the tambourine the third awoke— Philo stood charmed, their feet the music spoke. These scenes did all the vagrants' arts explain, With these he never wished to meet again; Then were Deception's masks all torn away— In higher spheres he spent each future day. When o'er Brussels dark Night had cast her shade, Hundreds were dressing for the masquerade, In all the varied costumes nations wear In every clime throughout each hemisphere. As great Apollo Philo's head was crowned, Who led the dance, with Muses circled round. With grand, majestic step Apollo trod— The sons of song paid homage to the god. First Homer came, a venerable form, Upon his breast portrayed the ocean storm, Above, the gods, descending from the sky, Some to defend, and some to ruin Troy; Across the poet's breast a robe was flung, And there portrayed the battles that he sung. Next ancient Hesiod, whose mighty strains Were heard from earth to the celestial plains; Sappho and tuneful Virgil next appear, Horace and Pindar pay their homage there. Then Shakespeare comes, with a majestic mien, The trumpet's sounds the greatest bard proclaim; Apollo bows, and reaches forth his hand, Around the Muses and the poets stand; Apollo crowns him with a wreath of light, Whereon is written, “Nature, Depth, and Height.” Cupid is on his robe, the dying maid Within the tomb of Capulets portrayed; The field of battle, and the ocean storm, The solemn ghost, and Ariel's fancied form; The meeting armies, and the murdered kings, E'en some short sketch of all created things. Philo, to praise the mighty bard, displayed The noblest scene of all the masquerade; His robes he changed, the merry dance he joined With fair French belles, as lovely as refined. Through every stage of life he strove to pass, Resolved to see how varied Nature was: But here the youth was foolish, learned, and vain, His genius drowned in the bright champagne; Wisdom departed, riot took her place, And led young Philo into deep disgrace. The scene must drop, and hide him from our sight, With all the follies of a drunkard's night. Learning is not true wisdom. Youths may be Refined and polished to a high degree; Genius may mark the scholar for her own, Yet by her brightest sons is often shown Minds that can soar in rapture to the skies, On Learning's wings—feel noblest ecstasies, Then sink to earth; and mixing with the throng, In Folly's path with drunkards roll along. With best of resolutions Philo came, And deeply sighed, through grief and inward shame. Oppressed with sickness, his ideas fled, His memory weakened, and an aching head; A ruined appetite, a trembling hand, His pen obeying not his mind's command. To drive away the melancholy train Of dark ideas, he flew to wine again; An ecstasy he felt in getting drunk— To what a depth his learned mind was sunk! Then horror seized him, and his eyes rained tears, That all the learning of his youthful years, With which his father hoped to make him blessed, Should only leave his bosom more oppressed. Oft would his mind upon the muses' wings Soar to the skies, and leave all earthly things; Beyond mortality were Philo's strains Tuned to the orbs that deck the heavenly plains. He sung not love's soft passion, lovers' care, His theme the heavens, the ocean, earth, and air; In deepest bursts of passion he could shine, And power and harmony filled every line. With thoughts original, with words at will, His verses made his readers' blood run chill, But not with horror,—'mid the stars he trod, And sung th' omnipotence of Nature's God; On wings of fancy his unfettered soul Flew far as comets soar or planets roll. Where undescribed Infinity had birth, He looked in vain for this small spot of earth, Beheld the Almighty's power the systems guide, Then asked—“What am I? what is human pride, What our conceptions, learn whate'er we can, What is the pomp, the dignity of man, Compared with Him? How mighty is the thought! He spoke—the worlds, the systems sprung from nought? Rolling in darkness all the heavenly spheres, He says, ‘Let there be light!’ and light appears; And when it shall be the Creator's will, A word can make the rolling orbs be still. At His command the orbs burst out in flame, Or fade to nothing, whence at first they came.” At intervals, the muse of Philo sung In strains like these, then silent was her tongue. The hand that holds the fatal potion shakes, Invention's fled, the nervous feeling wakes; His eyes have lost their fire, his faltering tongue Speaks not in sentences so firm and strong, His memory's fled, invention laid at rest— His heart-strings quiver in his weakened breast; But still the thoughts of other bards' despair, The sons of misery and rankling care, Prompted a last, though enervated lay, And this the substance of his weak essay: “Where merit lives, the greatest sorrow swells, Fortune forsakes the spot where anguish dwells; Obscure in life the man of letters mourns, While hope, and care, and sorrow come by turns; Or if his reputation widely spread, Oft has he starved, and even wanted bread, Perished in poverty, of little note, While others profited by what he wrote. “The poor blind Homer, noblest bard of all, Or moved by want, or pressed by hunger's call, Mourning in shame, he scarce durst raise his head, But spoke immortal verse to gain his bread. Plautus, whose verses made all ages smile, A miller was—then sat, and wrote awhile; It was no shame that he, a poet born, Should sometimes sing, whilst others ground the corn. Xylander studied at eighteen for fame, His hope, his glory, was a poet's name: His notes on Dion Cassius, every line, Were sold for want, that he once more could dine; Then his young vanity for ever fled, He thought, he studied, how to write for bread. Agrippa in a workhouse laid his head, But soon they found the great Agrippa dead; Forced from his native valleys to depart, Despair and poverty had broke his heart. The tuneful Camoens sweetly strung his lyre— Dimmed was the poet's eye, and quenched his fire; He, who could tune his wildest notes so sweet, Perished from hunger in the public street; Child of the muses! he, a poet born, Found, with his broken harp, a corpse at morn! Upon the bard the haughty, wealthy gaze, And those who most neglected, gave him praise. He heard it not, his noble soaring mind Was glad to leave such cold neglect behind. Tasso, in great distress, had nought to spend, Till he a crown had borrowed from a friend; And when in study he sat up at night, So poor, he oft was destitute of light; But soared above all want, he wrote—and praise Has formed his chaplet in succeeding days. Great Ariosto bitterly complains Of poets' misery, of poets' gains, Till great Alphonso gave a lovely spot, And built the bard a little rustic cot; When these were done, the poet's soul was glad, Yet he so poor, his furniture was bad; He found few riches flow from poets' strings, And palaces and verse are different things. See great Lord Burleigh, fav'rite of the queen, When Spenser was approaching, step between Her and the bard whose fame through lands resounds, Keeping the poet from the hundred pounds: He thought his clerks deserv'd far more than he— The child of genius and of poverty. But Burleigh's name detested shall be read, Who caused the bard to die for want of bread. O poets! hope not favour from the great, These merit often cast beneath their feet. Savage, unfortunate, by want distressed, When cares and sorrows on his bosom pressed, Th' eccentric ‘Wand'rer’ he had studied years, Smiled on its lines, or wet them with his tears, Starving through want, no silver he nor gold, For poor ten pounds the beauteous poem sold; And mighty Milton, who could sing of heaven, For his great work, had just the same sum given. Otway and Butler suffered here in time, One starved, and one imprisoned for his rhyme; But Chatterton, the noble-minded youth, Whose genius soared in hyperbole or truth, Whose fancy mounted on her airy wings, As o'er the clouds he touched his powerful strings, Oppressed with misery, o'ercome with care, Fell, early victim to a dark despair! A luxury he thought a single tart, And study and long starving broke his heart. He who to water got sometimes no bread, We see applauded, when the youth is dead. Poor Boyce, who wrote ‘Creation,’ see him stand, White as the paper, while Death shook his hand! Cold in the garret, destitute of fire, This son of song the world left to expire. No crust of cheese, and not an ounce of bread Found in his garret, when the bard was dead! Here had he died in penury alone, O'er his worn shoulders an old blanket thrown, A skewer thrust in before to keep it fast, And in his hand was found his pen at last! The tuneful Burns, old Scotia's darling pride, In his youth's bloom full prematurely died, Too independent was his mind to bend To ask a favour even from a friend; He struggled hard against his adverse fate, And when assistance came, it came too late: Yet, when the harp of Burns had ceased its sounds, They heaped upon his dust seven thousand pounds! I speak the truth, what every man must feel— This would have bought and stocked for him Mossgiel; But poets seldom rise while here they live, The critics break their hearts, and then a stone they give.” Philo, irresolute, is still led on, Till health, and genius, and his strength are gone. The rosy cheek is pale, the manly face, Where Health had stamped her own strong masc'line grace, Fast shrinks away, and difficult the breath— He feels the woeful harbingers of death. Fain would he turn to his once healthful food, But nought he sees can do the smallest good. Life would die out, as tapers do expire, Did not strong spirits keep alive the fire. His old companions, true to him when young, Come to inquire, but when he hears each tongue, Oh, how he weeps!—he knows what is the cause Of his strong system making such a pause, Wishes that all the spirits e'er he drunk, Had deep within the mighty ocean sunk. I leave the thoughts that press upon his mind, When he must leave his dearest love behind. The cares of earth with him will soon be o'er, But what a boundless ocean lies before. Amph'rus beheld his early grave, but grief Stifled his tongue, and tears gave no relief. The solemn chords, in dirges o'er the dead, Thrilled through his heart, and his soft bosom bled. The days of youth, but newly left behind, With all their pleasures, rushed upon his mind. Young Philo's sister he before had loved— From her his constant bosom never moved; But long had absence torn their hearts in twain, And deep the grief when these can meet again. With tears fair Rosabelle her sorrows spoke, And all the sister in her bosom woke: “Philo is now no more—oh! Amph'rus, hear This last request—I make it with a tear. Philo, my brother, is untimely gone, And Paros' sand of genius too is run— Oh! drink no more—stop, ere the hour come soon, Which makes your morning sun go down at noon!” He heard and wept—he trembled for his fate— He would return, but feared it was too late. His looks were fresh, but appetite was lost, His mind from music to despair was tost. Just like a youth when running down a hill, And shows his action and his youthful skill, Who sees, at length, a gulf where he must drop, But, swift his motion, and he cannot stop; He takes a spring, to live or rise no more— He's saved—his effort brings him safely o'er. Amph'rus beheld before the gulf of death, The grave wide yawning, his a feeble breath, Then he forsook strong spirits, drank good beer, He lives—and yet his noble notes I hear. When in the minster all the octaves swell, 'Tis Amph'rus' hand can touch the octaves well; 'Tis Amph'rus' hand can touch the soothing lute, 'Tis Amph'rus on the viol or the flute. In music Amph'rus in full splendour shines, And will do, like the sun, if he refrain from wines. But, oh! what morals do the writers make!— 'Tis better far to give advice than take. Oh! could I write that I myself could save From this one curse, this sure untimely grave, This endless want, that soon must stop my breath, These flaming draughts, which bring disease and death, Then should my Muse upon her wings advance, And Genius triumph o'er Intemperance. I know there's mirth, and oft a flash of joy, When friends with friends a social hour employ, When the full bowl is circled all around, And not a single jarring string is found; But truest wisdom of a young man's heart, Is well to know the moment to depart. Thousands of hopeful youths, who first begin To mix with friends in this bewitching sin, Soon lose their resolution, and what then? Their privilege is gone to other men, Their wealth has wasted, and the landlord, where They seemed so happy with his social cheer, When all is spent, and all resources o'er, Soon kicks the starving wretches out of door. I could employ my pen for weeks, for years, Write on this subject, wet it with my tears; For spacious as the ocean is the scope, For drinking drowns all genius, wealth, and hope, Lays best of characters below the dust, And fills connections with a deep distrust. But in weak verse the ills can ne'er be told— Eternity alone can these unfold. That I may know these ills, and stop in time, Is my last wish, as thus I end the rhyme. THE DRUNKARD'S RETRIBUTION. Where is the ink so sable in its hue, That can portray the picture dark and true; The horrid state which language fails to tell, The dark confusion, and the earthly hell! In such sad state how often have I thought— O! that I could sink backward into nought! Reason o'erthrown and anguish in its place, I thought myself below the reach of grace. Despair o'erwhelm'd my soul, and keen remorse: To know I lived, became my bitt'rest curse; My sorrowing friends appear'd my greatest foes, And cheerful songs but added to my woes. The phantom trumpets, the imagin'd band, Methought I heard, which summon'd me to stand High in the pillory—to meet disgrace; My trembling heart shrunk back from every face. Thus swiftly did imagination rove, And o'er the prostrate throne of reason drove. Afraid of poison from a mother kind, I durst not drink,—suspicion fill'd my mind. Each trembling leaf, if shaken by the blast, Struck me with terror as I hurried past. I deemed myself the cause of all the guilt That fills the earth—of all the blood e'er spilt, And that kind Heaven would deign on earth to dwell, Were I but hurried to the deepest hell. THE FALL OF BELSHAZZAR. Thus spoke Israel's God,—“Earth's inhabitants tell, Great Babylon's fallen, confounded is Bel! Merodach is broken! let Israel wave Its flag o'er the idols which never could save!” Her gates were of brass, and her ramparts were strong, And there were the feasting, the dance, and the song; Her horsemen were brave, and her archers were sure, And her streets were perfumed till the zephyrs were pure. Her great heathen temples were grand to behold, Their pillars were marble, their capitals gold; Since Adam first dwelt in fair Eden alone, Such glory and pomp on this earth never shone. Poor Israel, imprisoned, oppressed with the rod, Sat cheerless, but still they remembered their God; No armour had they but the fast falling tear, For the best arms of Israel were always a prayer. From the holes of the prison to Zion they turned Their sorrowful features, and inwardly mourned; They cried—“Let us once our Jerusalem see, And, Lord, all our praise shall be given to Thee!” The Lord saw their tears, and an army came forth— The terrible nations in arms from the north; The beasts of the forest were never more strong, And the very hills shook as the host marched along. All drunk in the city, none saw them advance; The music was there, and the timbrel and dance; The feast and the pleasures beneath night's dark pall, They thought not how soon the great city must fall, As the army drew nearer, no trumpet was heard, No flashing of spears or of helmets appeared; But their armour was such as but giants could wield, And their spears were as num'rous as corn in the field. The horsemen were spread in the front of the line— Chaldea! such horsemen were never yet thine; On the high northern hills, many furlongs afar, Stretched miles either way, was the rear of the war. As, guided by Heaven, the strong rampart they found, And hundreds of soldiers soon cut up the ground, Euphrates, released, ran swift from its bed, As the sign that great Babylon's glory was fled. Then thousands and thousands effected a pass, And found all unbolted the strong gates of brass; In silence they marched, till the palace they found, Then the trump of the host was commanded to sound. The brave sought their armour, the cowardly fled, And terror through every palace was spread: Such terror, such paleness the city spread o'er, As no trumpets can cause till old time is no more. Belshazzar's strong army awoke from their rest, And buckled a breastplate on every breast; But the armour was rusted, and blunt was the spear, No sharp-whetted swords, though the foe was so near. The torches were lighted, and blazed on each tower, The scene which they showed quite unnerved every power; For the arms of the foes were all polished so bright, That each seemed a torch by reflecting the light. The Medians, drunk in the monarch's proud court, The vessels destroyed, and made grandeur their sport; But those which belonged to the house of the Lord, Were all by the warriors, though barb'rous, restored. When drunken with wine, the wine ran a flood, Then they fought through the streets in a torrent of blood; Their swords were as red as the wine they had drunk, And little they fought ere ten thousand had sunk. The garments of princesses hung on their spears, And the crown of a prince on the pavement appears; The mighty Belshazzar is dragged from his seat, And the gems of his throne are as dust in the street. The breasts of the num'rous white chargers were red With the blood which had flowed from the dying and dead; The bright helms of steel, which the Medians wore, Were spotted all over with Babylon's gore. When morning arose, what dread terrors appeared! The streets of the city, which nothing had feared, Were strewed o'er with slain, and nor music nor mirth Shall ever sound more—for 'tis sunk to the earth. The shouts of the captives now joyful arise, And the praises of Israel ascend to the skies. The princes of earth, and the tyrants of all; If God be against them, how certain their fall! Awake, all ye captives! ye dead, from the grave! Shout—“The idols are broken which never could save!” And bear it, ye winds!—earth's inhabitants, tell Great Babylon's fallen, confounded is Bel!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lyrical and Descriptive Poems. AIREDALE'S BEAUTIES. Poets in varied verse may sing The rivers, vales, and hills, The dimpled lake, the crystal spring, The groves and rippling rills; The ancient domes, the lofty tow'rs, The moss-robed ruins grey, The sylvan shades, the rosy bow'rs, Where native beauties play. To those and twice ten thousand more, The lyre has often rung; But since the ancient bards gave o'er, Was ever Airedale sung? Why, O, ye youths—ye virgins fair, Have you so long been mute? Nor touched it with some lovely air To tremble on the lute? Are there no beauties glowing round, No Heliconian springs, No echoes, answering ev'ry sound, To animate your strings? No scenes where mountains' lofty heads Like famed Parnassus rise? No crystal streams, on pebbly beds, Reflecting half the skies? No rocks soft cushioned o'er with moss, As sofas for the fair? No daisy-spangled meads to cross, Within the vale of Aire? Yes! here are bow'rs where eglantines The fragrant roses bear; And here the honeysuckle twines, Perfuming sweet the air. The lilacs and laburnums wave Each beauteous flow'ry plume; And evergreens, that winter brave, The healthful breeze perfume. Here are green woods, and springs, and bow'rs, And purple-vestured hills, And fields, in yellow robes of flow'rs, Made bright with glitt'ring rills. The crimson-crested grouse are there, The whirring partridge grey, The pheasants haunt the fountains clear, And frisking leverets play. The treble sings the lark on high, In tenor joins the thrush; The bass the mellow blackbirds try Upon the blossomed bush. How sweet the scent the zephyrs bring From fields of clover white! Not gardens of an Eastern king Can yield him such delight. But not the heather's crimson bloom Can with the cheeks compare, Of those sweet maids, who nought assume,— The nymphs of Yorkshire Aire! Great Nature's hand has decked the scene With silv'ry rich cascades; But what had all these beauties been, Without the lovely maids? The cowslip meads, the daisied fields, The fragrant rosy bow'rs, And all the sweets the valley yields, When spring descends in show'rs, Are all outshone with lovely maids, That bloom when these grow pale, Whose virtues live when beauty fades,— The glory of the vale. BINGLEY'S BEAUTIES. Thy beauties, Bingley! never have been sung By stranger-bard, or native poet's tongue; Then may my humble muse with thee prevail To pardon my presumption, if I fail In this attempt thy beauties to rehearse In rustic strains of my untutor'd verse. Of all the learned youths whom thou hast sent To distant seas, or some far continent, Though these on thee have thought in other climes, All have forgot to praise thee in their rhymes. When on thy lovely vale I stand to gaze, I feel thou need'st from me no meed of praise: Thy hanging woods, thy fountains, and thy bowers, Thy dashing floods, thy landscapes, and thy flowers, Thy bold grey rocks, thy heathy purple fells, Where silent solitude with beauty dwells; Thy homes where honest worth stills finds a seat, And love and virtue a serene retreat— Such scenes as these should plume the poet's wing, And swell his heart while he attempts to sing. O may Religion, life's best hope and stay, The maids of Bingley teach the better way! Their minds instruct, their innocence protect, Their manners soften, and their paths direct; May they be like the turtles of the wood, That dip their bills in Aire's meandering flood; Then, at the last, faith's sunshine on each breast, Soar to the mansions of eternal rest! Their inborn principles of truth and love, Pure as the plumage of the turtle dove, Sweet as the flowers when bending to the sun, Are Bingley's daughters when they love but one. We have the mountain breeze, the cold pure spring; The woods where every British bird doth sing; Wild plants and flowers, wild birds, and scenes as wild, Or soft as any on which Nature smiled; Blooming and lovely, as the moon is fair, And pure as ether are the nymphs of Aire. The weeping birch, the great majestic oak, Where dark green ivy forms a winter's cloak; The purple heath, where dappled moorcocks crow; The sylvan vales, with timid hares below, The brooding pheasant, beauty of the wood, And spotted trouts that cleave the amber flood. For finer walks, for more sequestered bowers, For cooler grottos, and for richer flowers, For streams that wind more beautiful along, For birds with louder chorus to their song, For all that gen'rous Nature can bestow, All Yorkshire scenes to Bingley Vale must bow. FAIRY SONG. Let us trip in airy dances, While the weary mortals sleep; See the waning orb advances, Lighting those that vigils keep. In the nectar drown all trouble, Sweetened by the honey'd bee; Make a punch-bowl of a bubble, Underneath our fav'rite tree. We have not the cares of mortals, Nature's self our tailor is; Sorrow enters not our portals,— All our fairy-nights are bliss. Some fine peacock's lovely feather, Brightest that was ever seen, With its edge adorned with heather, Forms a carpet for our queen. Stop the dance—a beetle's coming, We must take his sable wing; Stop his flight and mournful humming, He must arm the fairy king. Now a moment's mirth and dancing,— We of songs have got no more; When the moon, so high advancing, Shows the fairy dance is o'er. Wings of insects on the river, We can borrow when we please; Then we fly away for ever, To the shades of joy and peace. JANUARY. Now bleak winter on the mountains Whirls on heaps the powder'd snow, Seals with ice the sandy fountains, While the streams can scarcely flow. Starving grouse forsake the rushes, Covered is their winter store, Seek for shelter in the bushes, While the heath is drifted o'er. Trees beneath their loads are bending; Firs like ostrich plumes appear; Partridge tame the barn attending, Pick the grain with stealthy fear. Hares the snow-drifts wander over, Forced the hawthorn buds to eat; Lost in snow the sprigs of clover, Covered are the blades of wheat. Now the thrasher, old and weary, Stops the northern door with straw; But the tempest, wild and dreary, Finds a way through ev'ry flaw. Notes of bass the cattle humming, Patient for their fodder call, Waiting long to see it coming, White with snow within the stall. Starved from woods, the beauteous pheasant Leaves the icy boughs and mourns, Haunts the cottage of the peasant,— Snows may melt, it ne'er returns. Thus the maids, their parents leaving, Wanton to the city fly, Soon with woes their breasts are heaving,— Virtue, honour, beauty, die! EVENING IN APRIL. (ON FIRST HEARING A BEE, 1824.) Welcome with thy monotone, Black and yellow lab'rer sweet! Thou this night hast nearly done Dancing with thy little feet On the willow's honeyed flower, On the daisy's crimson side, On the crocus near the bower, Which thy velvet coat has dyed. Thou thy little sable bill Hast in April blossoms dipped; From the cups upon the hill, Luscious drops of honey sipped: Thou hast slept the winter long, But thy merit is not lost; Thou hast yet the vernal song, Spite of winter's chilling frost. Thus the poet, as he sings, While the storm of sorrow low'rs, Finds that friendship gladness brings Sweet as dew on honeyed flow'rs. MAY-DAY. See the nymphs in May-day dresses, Dancing on the daisied green! Sloe-thorn blossoms grace their tresses, Brightest blue-bells deck their queen. While of thyme and unblown roses, Twined among the leaves of bay, Each a fragrant wreath composes, On the joyful holiday. Lyra tunes the rural measure, While the cowslips at her feet Dance, as if they felt the pleasure Of her trills and cadence sweet. See!—the lark her song suspending, Drops and listens to the air, While the snow-white lambs, attending, Strive to imitate the fair. Blithe and gay each nymph appearing, See, how innocent they smile! Each a branch of myrtle bearing On a breast that knows no guile. Where's the youth that could deceive them, Smiling on their morn of May, Gain their love, then scorning leave them, Like their garlands, to decay? MORNING IN MAY. The cascade's white mist o'er the trees is uprearing Its white curling head from the valley below, The bright glitt'ring dew-drops, like em'ralds appearing, All waken at once with Aurora to glow! The dark low'ring tempests of winter are over, And sweet is the breath of the high mountain gale; The hare leaves her favourite fields of white clover, And starts as she treads the dry leaves in the vale. The rooks and the ring-doves are flown to the fallow; From their dew-sprinkled pillows the daisies awake; From the thatch of the cottage skims forth the swift swallow, And strikes into circles the smooth polished lake. Near the stream the winds move not the weak-waving willow; The cattle are laid on the bright dewy hill; On the clear rippled stream hushed to rest ev'ry billow,— The day-busy sons of the hamlet are still. Hark! the birds are all chanting their song of the morning, Ye virgins, inviting to fields decked with dew! The fresh op'ning flowers will greet your returning, And bow their sweet heads in pure homage to you. Blithe Health on the mountain sits smiling thus early, With young Vernal Sweetness, her sister, in green, While Virtue, their mother, who loves them so dearly, Points out to her daughters the beautiful scene. They call on the youths and the innocent lasses To see the rich beauties of nature half dressed, Forget all their joy-killing grief as it passes, Live happy and love, for such moments are blessed. They sit on the hill where the bullfinch is bending, In beautiful plumage, the weak birchen bough; With gay feathered songsters their mellow notes blending, In sweet rural chords, where the sloe-blossoms grow, But to sing of the rich varied landscape before us, With all the fine beauties that Nature displays, Requires all the muses to join in the chorus, And sweet smiling cherubs to chant in its praise! MARY OF MARLEY. At Marley stood the rural cot, In Bingley's sweet sequestered dale, The spreading oaks enclosed the spot Where dwelt the beauty of the vale. Blessed with a small, but fruitful farm, Beneath the high majestic hill, Where Nature spread her every charm That can the mind with pleasure fill. Here bloomed the maid nor vain nor proud, But like an unapproached flower, Hid from the flattery of the crowd, Unconcious of her beauty's power. Her ebon locks were richer far Than is the raven's glossy plume; Her eyes outshone the ev'ning star; Her lovely cheeks the rose's bloom. The mountain snow, that falls by night, By which the bending heath is pressed, Did never shine in purer white Than was upon her virgin breast. The blushes of her innocence Great Nature's hand had pencilled o'er; And Modesty the veil had wrought Which Mary, lovely virgin, wore. At early morn each fav'rite cow The tuneful voice of Mary knew; Their answers hummed,—then wand'ring slow, From daisies dashed the pearly dew. When lovely on the green she stood, And to her poultry threw the grain, Ring-doves and pheasants from the wood Flew forth, and glittered in her train. The thrush upon the rosy bow'r Would sit and sing while Mary stayed; Her lambs their pasture gamboll'd o'er, And on the new-sprung clover fed. She milked beneath the beech-tree's shade, And there the turf was worn away, Where cattle had for cent'ries laid, To shun the summer's sultry ray. Lysander, from the neighbouring vale, Where Wharf's deceitful currents move, To Mary told a fervent tale, And Mary could not help but love. The richest might have come and sighed; Lysander had her favour won,— Her breast was constant as the tide, And true as light is to the sun. When winter, wrapped in gloomy storm, Each dubious path had drifted o'er, And whirled the snow in ev'ry form, To Mary oft he crossed the moor. When western winds and pelting rain Did mountain snows to rivers turn, These swelled, and roared, and foamed in vain, Affection helped him o'er the bourne. Until the last, the fatal night, His footsteps slipped—the cruel tide Danced and exulted with its freight, Then lifeless cast him on its side! How changed is lovely Mary now! How pale and frantic she appears! Description fails to paint her woe, And numbers to recount her tears. THE MAID OF LOWDORE. The crest of dark Skiddaw was misty and dreary, The winds roared aloud near the hoarse raven's nest, The strongest with reaching its top would be weary, And like the young lover, be wishful to rest,— The lover that wandered, his breast with love burning, For Anna, the beautiful maid of Lowdore, Who watched the clouds as she wished his returning, But night came too soon—he returned no more. Beneath him the dark mist rolled rapid in motion; Above was the evening star seen through the cloud; But the mist was as fatal to him as the ocean, When seas wash the lost from the wave-beaten shroud. A wand'rer he roamed, where the curlew was screaming, Till he heard the deep roar of the lone mountain flood; Of danger approaching he little was dreaming, Though on the high verge of dire terror he stood. He thought on his Anna, with earnest endeavour Tried to reach the blest spot his soul did adore; He steps—shrieks, and falls!—but the shepherd can never Return to his love at the falls of Lowdore. His Anna now nightly sits list'ning with wonder, To hear in the tempest the high cataract's roar; And thinks she can hear, in the midst of its thunder, Her shepherd call “Anna, the Maid of Lowdore!” LINES ON AN OLD OAK TREE, LATELY STANDING IN SPINK WELL WOOD, NEAR BRADFORD. (WRITTEN IN 1819.) Behold the place, ye youths and virgins, see Where stood your ancient oak, your fav'rite tree! How changed is now the place from whence it sprung, And, like yourselves, grew vig'rous, stout, and strong! Unmoved it stood each storm and wint'ry blast, While o'er its head revolving cent'ries passed,— Perhaps two hundred years it still improved, Two hundred more by wasting time unmoved; But recently, as greatest mortals die, It met its fate—see where its fragments lie! What veneration once the tree received,— Respected by the rich and poor it lived: Beneath its shade the pious breathed their pray'rs; Beneath its shade the wretched shed their tears; Beneath its shade have parting lovers stood, While from the fair one's eyes escaped the flood. Beneath the shelter of the fav'rite oak, What vows were made, by faithless lovers broke! But now, alas! ye antiquarians, mourn, Your tree is gone, and never can return. No more can you its ancient arms behold, Withered by time, and crumbling into mould. Its infancy, its youth, and manhood past, Though British oak, 'tis forced to yield at last. But, had it lived in Studley's peaceful shades, Nor delvers' mattocks, hammers, nor their spades Had e'er been raised by the unfeeling clown, To strike this only ancient vestige down. Had it been mine, it should not yet have dropped, But, where 'twas weak, I had its weakness propped, Told o'er its story to the feeling breast, And kept the tree while Bradford keeps its crest. But why lament? since Nature says that all That springs from earth, to earth again must fall. So must the stately tow'rs of polished stone Crumble to earth, and wear a mossy crown, While nettles form their canopies of state, And rankest weeds but mock their change of fate. The sculptured marble monuments decay, And crowns, and thrones, and statues fade away. The mighty monarch, and the warrior brave, The greatest sultan and the meanest slave, The wretched miser and most beauteous fair, The rich possessor and succeeding heir, Princes and courtiers, chiefs of ev'ry state, Both high and low, must all submit to fate. So, rest in peace, famed oak, though doomed to fall, For such a mighty change awaits us all! ON VISITING A WORKHOUSE. Allowed to walk into the sad retreat Where tott'ring age and foolish fair ones meet, I heard deep sighs from those bent down with years, Whose cheeks were deeply furrowed o'er with cares. To see their locks, by ruthless Time turned grey, Melted my heart, and took my pride away: For who was seated in the corner chair, But one who in my youth I held most dear. Oft had his hand, when I was but a boy, Handled the knife and made me many a toy; For me he caught the sparrows on the snow, And made my youthful heart with raptures glow! Oft had I danced around him with delight, While he had balanced well my little kite: But now, my aged friend, when he should eat, His palsied hands can scarcely bear his meat,— His pleasures lost, to life he's but a slave, And only waits his passport to the grave. Here I beheld how mortals waste away, Shoot up to manhood, blossom, and decay! In woolsey gown, close seated by his side, His sister Ann, of Harewood once the pride, Beauteous and fair,—upon her bridal day The wealthy countess scarce appeared more gay; But the fine brow that bore the glossy hair, Which once she dressed with such assiduous care, Was furrowed o'er by Time's all-changing plough, And her few locks were nearly white as snow. When I had stood a while, and dried the tear, I spoke, but John my words could scarcely hear; At length he cried, in exclamation strong, “Ay! is that thee?” for still he knew my tongue. His age-dimmed eyes then brightened with a ray, Which like a wasted taper died away. Dotage had seized upon his feeble brain, As he revolved to infancy again. A while he spoke of heav'n and things divine, Then laughed—and stopped a moment to repine; Wished for the grave,—next talked of things to come, Then wept—and thought of his once happy home, But his poor heart was most of all subdued With daughters' pride, and sons' ingratitude. “Alas!” said he, “that those who owe me all, “Should know me thus, and yet refuse to call “To spend one hour, to mitigate my grief, “To bring one cordial, or afford relief. “Though they neglect a father, old and poor, “They yet may have to enter at this door; “Yet oh, avert it, Heav'n! blessed may they live; “Oh teach an injured father to forgive!” Touched with the scene, I turned aside to weep, And like a child he calmly fell asleep! THE MALT-KILN FIRE. When friends who loved from infant years, Whose friendship ne'er went wrong, Are met to tell their joys and cares, Or join the cheerful song, What bard but to the utmost height Would string the rustic lyre, When friends with home-brewed drink are met Around the Malt-kiln fire? Sometimes we're faring low at home, Then feasting with a squire; But we've as much as we can wish Around the Malt-kiln fire. From this warm, happy, cheerful place, Old sorrow must retire, And nought but joy dare show her face Around the Malt-kiln fire. We talk of friends we long have known, Some fall'n, and some ris'n higher; Happy as monarchs on the throne, Around the Malt-kiln fire. What means our food? we pass away— Of life begin to tire; But never was a mournful day Around the Malt-kiln fire. With snuff, tobacco, and a pipe, And all we can desire, Old Care's forgot, and pleasure shines Around the Malt-kiln fire. No wife to scold, none to intrude, We laugh until we tire; With good strong drink as e'er was brewed, Around the Malt-kiln fire. Let blackguards swear, and rage, and fight, And scuffle in the mire; No angry word, for all is right, Around the Malt-kiln fire. Had we but spent more evenings there, Our spirits had been higher, And drunk less brandy, and more beer Around the Malt-kiln fire. THE SNOWDROP. Pretty little modest gem, First in Nature's diadem; Pressed with snow, the first to rise, Pure as stars that deck the skies. With thy crown of spotless white, Like a fairy of the night, Bending down thy modest head,— Frost thy pillow, snow thy bed. 'Mid the hail, the sleet, the frost, In the snow-storm sometimes lost; But thy beauteous head appears Lovelier with its icy tears. So thou gentle, modest fair, Brav'st the storm with truth and care; Though not like the roses drest, Virtue blossoms in thy breast, Brighter than the brightest star, Seen to glitter from afar: Guilt can never hang on thee; Truth lives through eternity. He that made the snowdrop knows When the storm of sorrow blows: And with all His mighty care, Will protect the virtuous fair. A PLACE OF RURAL RETIREMENT. Hail, thou sequestered rural seat, Which ever beauteous dost appear, Where the sweet songsters oft repeat Their varied concerts, wild and clear! Upon thy crystal-bosomed lake Th' inverted rocks and trees are seen, Adorned with many a snowy flake, Or in their leafy robes of green. Oh could a rural rhymer sing The beauteous scene so richly dressed, Where piety may plume her wing, And sweet seclusion form her nest! Here may the contemplative mind Trace Nature and her beauties o'er, And meditation rest reclined, To hear the neighbouring cat'ract roar. Here, tired of the gay scenes of life, The sire may see his children play, While Heav'n has blessed him with a wife, Who smiles his happy hours away. If ever fairies tripped along, Or danced around in airy mirth, They surely to this place would throng,— Or else they never danced on earth. The loves and graces here might stay; Th' enamoured pair, with bosoms true, Unseen appoint the nuptial day, Among those scenes for ever new. The poet tune his rustic lyre, If genius trembled on the strings; And merit modestly aspire, Where friendship dwells to plume his wings. Oh that I could this tribute pay As 'tis upon my heart impressed! My song of friendship here would stay, When waves the grass above my breast. THE VALE OF ILKLEY. “The heavens appear to love this vale.” —Wilson. Why does not some great bard, whose potent mind No earthly passions in its sphere can bind, Take the tun'd lyre, which wakes at genius' spells, And sing in praise of Ilkley and its wells? Had I a Shakespeare's pen, a Byron's powers, Nor mountains, woods, nor valleys, trees, nor flowers, Nor all that poets have for ages sung, Since Homer's harp or Sappho's lyre was strung, Should tempt my muse, on ocean or on shore, Till I had sung the charms of Rom'lies' Moor; What is commonly distinguished by the name of Rombles Moor, I have called Romilies' Moor, as I believe the appellation to have been derived from the Romilies, its Norman possessors. Where sits Retirement—Silence at her side— Upon the rocks, which frown at human pride, Grey with old Time and with the northern blast, And firm remain'd while changing empires pass'd; Before the massive pyramids they stood, Old as clear Wharf, and ancient as the Flood. Thou who giv'st light, and life, and nature's springs, Who art ador'd while all creation sings, Lend me Thine aid, Eternal Father! be My muse, my helper, while I sing of Thee! But how I sink beneath Thy wond'rous pow'r, A poor, weak, mortal insect of an hour! Though all Thy works are glorious, as sublime, Too great to celebrate in feeble rhyme, Yet of Thy lesser beauties will I sing, The mountain's sweetness, the unchanging spring, Healthful as pure, and plentiful as free, As one great gift in wide infinity. Such is thy Well, thou place of health and peace! And so it must be till all motion cease; Till time and tides, obedient to His will, Shall pause, and all the universe stand still! Thus speaks the rushing fountain in its pride: “Mortals, let nature ever be your guide! Rise with the sun on spring's delightful morn, When nature's concerts on the winds are borne! See the broad river shining with His rays, And glitt'ring dew-drops trembling to His praise! Millions of flowers, in all their varied dyes, Offer their sweets in one great sacrifice!” Pure as the henna is the mountain thyme, And all too rich for poor descriptive rhyme. Upon these hills the botanist may range Amongst the various mosses as they change; The alpine plants, unknown in valleys green, Creeping among the purple heath are seen; And, Rom'lies' Moor! the home of the curlew, Cloth'd with the clouds, thy beauties are not few. Nor Skiddaw's top, nor great Helvellyn's height, Shows greater grandeur to the ravish'd sight, Than does the crown of wide-spread Rom'lies' Moor, Where the vast scene is stretched to either shore. There we behold the hills of many a shire; The lofty mountains to the clouds aspire; Whernside uprears on high his snow-clad crest, While the blue Pendle trembles in the west; The hills of Derbyshire are southward seen, Though vales divide, and rivers roll between; Old Ingleborough lifts his time-worn head, And Yorkshire as one spacious map is spread: Yonder the towers of Ebor's fane appear, And Cleveland hills their broad blue tops uprear; Leeds, wrapt in smoke, dark-looming, eastward lies; But here the air is pure as are the skies. Far from the noise of all created things, No sound is heard but from the moorcock's wings; The pomp of human greatness here is lost, Or falls like mites beneath the winter's frost. A scene like this, within old England's coast, Nor Matlock, Buxton, nor proud Bath can boast. Grandeur and peace upon the Station The Station is the highest point on Romilies' Moor, from which place Captain Mudge took his observations nearly seventy years ago. dwell, And Health sits smiling at the mountain well; Rock, river, mountain, valley, hill, and tree, Contend for beauty as for majesty. Ye British beauties, of fair Eden's mould, Come, see the grandeur that these vales unfold. Daisies spring in modest pride, With the cowslips at their side! Roses blush and lilies shine— Wharfdale! blooming health is thine. Days of Romans, in the shade, As far distant objects fade: When their polish'd shields did shine, Days of warriors once were thine. On the towers, now long unseen, Have the steel-clad warriors been, Hurling weapons at the foe, While the Saxons fought below. Danes have drunk at Ilkley wells; Hosts have fought where Lister dwells! Many a trumpet's piercing tone Echo'd loud from Hanging Stone. The eastern promontory of Ilkley Crag. In his link-mail armour bright, Myddleton, the warrior knight, Some five hundred years ago, Glitt'ring rode to meet the foe. But the trumpet now is still; Not a rock from yonder hill Echoes back the piercing blast, As when Fairfax' troopers pass'd. Briton, Druid, Roman, Dane, Knight, and warrior, all are gone— Saxon, Norman, bard, and thane, Thou survivest Myddleton! Those whom trade as vot'ries owns— Who have hung the counter o'er— Who have crav'd for wealth in towns, Till their comforts are no more, Let them come and dine on trout— Lovely Wharfdale's famous fishes; Give relief to anxious doubt— Taste the best of Wharfdale's dishes. On each side the world is still; Not a voice disturbs the scene. Where is raised dark Hober Hill, Rising from its base of green, On these heights Retirement reigns, Far above all mortal ills; While upon the mountain plains Wild birds drink from purest rills. At the foot of Simon's seat, 'Mid the shades, sits silent Thought: Glitt'ring in this lone retreat Darts the gold-bespangled trout. There the peaceful ruin stands Underneath the mighty hill, Where the priors had their lands, Where the abbots rang'd at will. Dark, amid the shadowy woods, Are the jaws of terror hid, Where Wharf's rapid, foaming floods Thunder through the yawning Strid. See what grandeur—terror, hung On the dark electric cloud, From the waves of ocean sprung, O'er yon distant woodlands bowed. Deep it rolls upon the Stake; A well-known mountain in Wharfdale. Dread the loud tremendous roar; Deeper still its echoes wake On the heights of Rom'lies' Moor. When the whirlwind rends the woods, And the lightning's vivid glare Glances on the glitt'ring floods, Ev'ry hill says, “God is here!” Where is He not?—the earthquake shows His power; He rules the thunder, lives in ev'ry flower; Rides on the rapid tempests as they pass, And shines in glory on each blade of grass. The whole creation—ev'ry distant sphere— Immensity proclaims, “Lo! God is here!” Dark-brooding clouds, precursors of the storm, O'er mortals pass ashamed, and cry, “Reform!” Priest, lord, and king, and ye ungrateful poor— Let reformation enter ev'ry door! Let every heart that swells a Briton's breast, Receive that pure, that bright, immortal guest, For ever constant and for ever free, Which sav'd a world—sweet, smiling Charity! O Ilkley! noble are thy ancient halls, Thy beauteous valleys—grand thy waterfalls; Lovely thy groves, thy grottos, crystal rills; Thy antique church, and all thy woodland hills. Round thee have all the pleasures of the chase Smil'd in past ages on a happy race; The huntsman's horn, the shout, the bay of hounds, Have fill'd thy valleys with their merry sounds; And health has liv'd where exercise has been, In thy old castle, through each varied scene. But times have chang'd—old customs are no more, The mirth and pomp in ancient hall are o'er; Dumb are the minstrels, mute the harpers' lays, And fled the sports of Ilkley's festive days, When yearly its old church with music rung, And the high mass by Bolton's priests was sung. No modern fane, on consecrated ground, Can ever echo such a solemn sound As that which peal'd within the ancient choir, When all its tapers shone with hallow'd fire. THE HUNTERS' DIRGE. Ye woods, in Rishworth's verdant vale, Which oft have echoed to the horn! Ye rocky hills, that blushed so deep, From hunters gay at early morn! Weep, till your tears in crystal rills Make winding Aire with grief run o'er, That on the brown-robed heathy hills, The huntsman's shout is heard no more. Ye Nimrods old, who heard the sounds By changing echoes borne away, Who crossed the moors in joyful chase, And pleasure, on the sportive day! Go sit, where you unearthed the fox, And mourn till echo hear and weep; Wet, with your tears, the time-worn rocks, That modern squires no huntsmen keep; Mourn o'er great Parker's ancient race; Round Marley Hall in sorrow tread; Where dwelt the glory of the chase, Who oft the noble sportsmen led. Then take the horn, the requiem blow, O'er rural bliss that now is lost, And sound the dirge o'er those laid low, Who never sighed at hunting's cost! FEMALE CONSTANCY. Stars through rolling centuries shine, Nor does their lustre ever fade; And thus the virtues of the maid Glitter when her form's decayed, With beauteous radiance divine, Who never sighed to any swain But one, and constant doth remain, Still rememb'ring him with care, Before the Maker of the spheres She breathes for him incessant prayers, And not another youth appears, That wounds the bosom of the fair: And can the youth deceive such love, And conscience never once reprove? Maids to flowers have been compared, But flowers of sweetest scent decay: So doth the fair, who runs astray From Virtue's sweet sequestered way, Whose heart to many a youth is shared; While she who true through life has been, Falls like a branch of evergreen. THE FAITHFUL WIFE. From times of ancient Greece, the fair By greatest poets have been sung,— The virgins with the lovely air, And all their beauties fresh and young; But praises greater far are due To her who braves the storms of life, In ev'ry state her bosom true— At ev'ry age the faithful wife. How many nymphs have gained the praise When blithe sixteen upon them shone; But soon the transient bloom decays, And ev'ry outward beauty's gone. While she who in her bosom bears A spark of virtue's sacred fire, Which like the purest gem appears, When love's impetuous flames expire, Is lovelier far when pale and cold— She falls like autumn's ripened grain; Our mem'ries then her worth unfold, And wish her here to shine again. SONG. [The birks may wave, the heath may bloom] The birks may wave, the heath may bloom, The lasses trip the mountains o'er, And deck their breasts with blossom'd broom, But I can touch my harp no more. The lambs may skip, the fishes sport, And glitter in their woodland rills, But I no more the muse can court, Where thyme perfumes the purple hills. There oft my sweet Elvina sung, And softly trill'd the rural lay, Till raptures in my bosom sprung, “As pleasure wing'd my hours away.” But Nature now is fresh in vain; The richest gifts to me are poor, For bliss can never come again, And I can touch my harp no more. No more with joy can I behold Elvina, deck'd with heather bloom; The hand which oft I press'd is cold, The heart that lov'd me in the tomb. But still she lives in realms of day, Far distant from a world of pain: Oh! could I soar to her away, Then would I touch my harp again.</field>

WHERE ARE THEY? “I betook myself to the repositories of the dead; and I exclaimed, in a plaintive tone, ‘Alas! where are they?’ and Echo replied, in the same plaintive tone, ‘Alas! where are they?’” —From the Arabic. Soft! behold in the shade the dark abbey appearing; Hark! yon sad plaintive voice,—it is Myra the fair; The black robe of crape see the virgin is wearing, And mourns her lost lover deposited there. What a stillness! how solemn!—'tis awfully fine! Night's queen throws the dark cloudy vale from her face. The ivy leaves tremble, as faintly they shine, And silence is now the sole lord of the place: 'Twas thus when fair Myra turned slow from the dead, And cried out—“Alas! where are they?” Echo heard the sad sound—through the cloisters she fled, And whispered in sorrow—“Alas! where are they?” When the pale moon was shining upon the clear river, Sad Laura went slowly to mourn o'er the dead: Her husband, her son, and her daughter, for ever Reposed where the branches of cypress were spread. She leaned on the cold marble statue which stood At the head of the tomb, till she fainted away! She revived—the tears gushed from her eyes like a flood, As her words burst in anguish—“Alas! where are they?” 'Twas silent around, and no answer was heard, But Echo, which bore the sad question away, Asked the grottoes, the groves, and each sorrowful bird, In soft dying cadence—“Alas! where are they?” To the place of the dead we may walk deeply mourning, To sigh o'er our children, our lover, or sire, But from the dark shades there is now no returning,— Without them in sorrow we weep and retire. We may gaze on the turf, or the fine-sculptured bust, And sorrowful ask—“Where are they?” If a faint mournful voice seems to rise from the dust, 'Tis but soft plaintive Echo that asks—“Where are they?” THE CONSECRATION OF ST PAUL'S CHURCH, SHIPLEY. How can a sinner dare to sing the praise Of Him on whom e'en seraphs cannot gaze, Whose glory shines in ev'ry varied place, Throughout infinity—unbounded space! Who formed the hills, who arched the azure sky— The king of undescribed eternity: Yet, let my heart with trembling rapture glow, My tears for all His by-past mercies flow, That yet I live, that yet He gives me breath, And saves a sinner from deserved death. Oh! let my heart be tuned, the praise to sing Of man's great Saviour! heaven's eternal King! The universe His glorious temple is, His secret place the heavens—the seat of bliss; But that great God who all the world commands, Stoops down to dwell in temples made with hands, Accepts the breathings of the contrite breast, Relieves the burdened, gives the weary rest. He hears each humble sound poor mortals make, Though His own choir the heaven of heavens can shake! How grand the sight! how beautiful to view The thousands thronging round the churches new; To see the colours waving on the wind, The great Archbishop with his flock behind; To hear the new, the dulcet virgin chime, Which brings to mind the day of olden time! The lame are seen with crutches halt along, The old, the blind, are mingled with the throng; E'en those who think another creed is right, Press on the way, to see the noble sight. 'Twas thus, when Fountain's Fountain's Abbey, near Ripon. lofty pile of old, Was opened with the priests adorned in gold; When all the pomp of ages long gone by, Burst in magnificence upon each eye. The grounds of Studley were with people spread, When the Archbishop first at Fountain said: “Lift up your heads, ye gates! eternal doors, Ascend! for God is come—that God is ours! Who is the Lord?” then burst the mighty song, “The God of battle, terrible and strong! He comes! He comes! adorned with power and love, Ye gates, arise! ye heavenly portals, move!” The chorus bursts—His praises sound aloud, And God descends to bless the list'ning crowd. Whatever other sects shall please to say, Here let poor mortals find the heavenly way, Till moss grows on the tow'r, or on the walls, And each fine antiquated column falls; Here may discordant sects unite to raise Loud anthems to their Heavenly Father's praise; Before His throne in meek submission fall, And each one strive to crown Him Lord of all! Let party zeal be banished from each mind, And all to holiness alone inclined; Let none in wild and scornful ecstasy, Cry out—“The temple of the Lord are we!” But charity let each meek pastor teach, And love to God and man undaunted preach; Let servile fear be driven from his breast, And ever on his Saviour's promise rest: “Lo! I am with thee always, to defend And bless the Gospel, till each rebel bend.” ON THE NEW CHURCH AT WILSDEN. (WRITTEN APRIL 1824.) What temples, various, since old Time began, Have on this little globe been reared by man! What different kinds of gods been worshipped here, Since earth, new formed, was balanced in the sphere Some, ere the pointed pyramids arose, In lands remote, which scarce a modern knows. The sumptuous Jewish temples—where are they, Which seemed to scorn old ruin and decay? When cost was nought,—and Asia, at command Brought forth its treasures to the builder's hand: But now—would Europe golden millions give One column from these fabrics to receive, 'Tis all in vain,—no stone nor Hebrew bust, But cent'ries since have been reduced to dust! All the old temples built when Hesiod sung, And those which stood when Homer's harp was strung, Are covered o'er with herbage or with trees, And not one stone the antiquarian sees. The abbeys where “Te Deum” oft was sung, And where the instruments of music rung, Where “Venite Exultemus” used to rise In praise devout, ascending to the skies, Are clothed with ivy in its solemn green, And modern artists pencil o'er the scene. Successive storms the tow'rs in furrows wear, And on their columns dampy sweats appear; The creeping shrubs upon the arches grow Suspended o'er the humbler weeds below; And high engraved upon the time-worn scroll, Scarce legible, the words, “Pray for the soul.” The grass waves wildly on the broken wall, And ev'ry year some time-worn fragments fall. Not so with thee, thou church, so fair and new, White as the polished marble to the view. Ere any stone is loosened from thy wall, New states shall rise, and present empires fall! Perhaps, like Greece, old Albion shall decay, Ere those fine columns shall be worn away; Its commerce and its glory be no more, And science fled to some far distant shore. With lofty trees thou may'st be circled round,— And here the deep-toned organ yet may sound. A town may flourish on this barren hill, Renowned for science, commerce, wealth, and skill! Here shall some pastor, learned, good, and just, In solemn pause resign the dust to dust,— Perform each office with a pious care, And cheer the wretched sinking in despair. The bride, with modest blushes on her face, Shall lightly tread across the hallowed place, So filled with joy when to the altar led, Joy, mixed with fear,—a momentary dread! Here will the pious sons and daughters mourn, As slowly from a parent's tomb they turn; Here shall the tuneful youths, the virgin train, Join with the organ in a holy strain, Touched by the sweet expressive warbling trills, Which give the undescribed cold shiv'ring thrills, Such as to those with feeling minds are giv'n, Which charm the soul, and lift it up to heav'n! But diff'rent sects in time may yet arise,— The present doctrines of the Church despise; A future reformation yet may come, And o'er our blessed religion cast a gloom. Such great mutations have all earthly things— How oft have creeds been changed by different kings! The future generations yet may hope For heav'nly bliss through pardons from the pope. The cross, the holy water, and the shrine Of some famed saint, may yet be thought divine! But whatsoever doctrine here is giv'n, May each succeeding pastor teach the way to heav'n! RETURN OF THE SWALLOW. Swift-winged and pleasing harbinger of spring! Thou from thy winter's voyage art returned, To skim above the lake, or dip thy wings In the sequestered river's winding streams. Instinct has brought thee to the rural cot, From whence, with new-fledged wings, thou took'st thy flight. Oh! could I give thee intellect and tongue, That thou to man might'st tell what mazes wild; And what eccentric circles thou hast flown Since thou didst soar in autumn far away! Cities in rising splendour thou hast seen, And those where solemn desolation dwells. Hast thou not peaceful slept the night away, Perched on the distant pyramid's high point; Or on some massive column's hoary top, Beheld great Ætna's dark sulphureous smoke, Then dipped thy wings upon the orient waves? Like thee, could man, with philosophic eye, Survey mankind in every varying clime, How would his mind expand! his spacious soul, Released from bigotry and party zeal, Would grasp the human race in ev'ry form,— Denominations, sects, and creeds, would sink, His mind o'erpowered with the thought that He Who formed the universe, regards them all! Upon this little wave-encircled isle, What scenes diversified might he behold! Here men of commerce, seeking after gain, To the emporium throng, as ants haste home When frowns the sky, and distant thunders roll; And there their youthful inexperienced sons, In wide extremes of pleasure, mirth, and joy, Heed not the cares their fathers' bosoms feel, But carelessly carouse the night away, Regardless of the wealth by prudence gained. Some crowd the theatres, by pleasure led;— But where's the theatre like Nature's own? Where sects of various creeds, like summer flies, Meet and re-meet, as though their hopes were placed As widely opposite as the extremes Of inconceivable unbounded space. Then what is man? think, O ye vain, ye proud! What his achievements, glory, wealth, or fame? Where can the history reach of all his deeds? Scarce o'er the little molehill of this earth. And what the various sects—Jews, Pagans, Turks, With those who to the mighty Spirit bow, The wand'ring Arabs, or the sable hordes Who scorched dwell in Afric's torrid vales,— Their idol gods, their temples, or their mosques, And even Christians, with their numerous sects, Divided, parted, and anatomised, Till almost ev'ry man's a different creed?— Astonished, he who thinks must make them one, And breathe a fervent pray'r,—Heav'n bless the whole! All works of man, performed with greatest art, Shall change, shall waste, and into ruin turn. Where are the pristine altars and the groves; The first rude temples, and the sacred rocks; The hieroglyphics, and the works of priests, Written in characters to us unknown? Where are the walls of Babylon? or where The glorious splendour of the Trojan courts; Egypt's geometry, and Grecian lore,— The thrones of emperors; the crowns of kings; The weapons of the warriors of old; The martial airs which cheered the Roman hosts; The wreaths with which the conquerors were crowned? All lost,—and dark oblivion wraps the whole! The mighty Chinese empire yet may fall Like those of Greece, of Egypt, and of Rome. Canton, with all its millions, may decay, And golden Hindoostan may yet arise, Turn from its gods,—embrace the Christian creed. Ye narrow-minded men, whose souls are bound, Give wings to thought, and let your fancy soar! See the tossed ocean leaping at the rocks, To tear them from their stations, and engulf The pond'rous masses in its foaming jaws! Behold the vessels wrecked,—the wretched crews, Pale with dread horrors, leave their grasp and sink, Their last faint shrieks all lost in ocean's roar! These are your fellow-mortals, and their state, Man with his reason, reading, wit, and all, May guess, but nought of certainty is there. Next view the field of war,—behold the fray On that small ant-hill, see the curling smoke, And hear the roar which twice three leagues can drown. Stand at a distance, and the armies fade. Let the volcano burst, the hosts are lost,— Smoke, lava, ashes would entomb the whole! Or did the earthquake open its wide jaws, Victor and vanquished, armour, banners, all Would sink,—and war be silent as the grave! Search for great Hannibal or Cæsar now; Where shines their grandeur? what can we behold But some few letters which record their names? Sage and philosopher, the ignorant and learned; The tyrant hated, and the prince beloved; The statesman, patriot, poet, and Mogul; The Indian chiefs, the despicable Deys; Those who with microscopes behold the mite, And they who calculate the comet's course, Measure the distances of heavenly orbs, Number their satellites, and think they view Islands and seas stretched o'er the distant spheres;— Kings, priests, and paupers—live, and then expire! Had poets but thy pinions, they would soar To taste the far-famed streams of Helicon; Artists and antiquarians, winged like thee, Would fly to view the works of Grecian art, Then soar to Atlas, or the pointed Alps, And rest where mortal footsteps ne'er were seen: Myriads would visit then the sacred place Where heav'n's Eternal Majesty expired. But man, proud man, with all his vaunted skill, Must travel slowly o'er this atom globe,— Though wonderful his new invented things, His art still leaves him destitute of wings. ASCENT OF MR GREEN'S BALLOON, FROM HALIFAX, APRIL 19, 1824. Behold th' assembled myriads near,— The shouts, the drums, the trumpets hear, When expectation's on the wing To see of aeronauts the king, Rise in his ornamented car, On wings of gas to soar afar! Behold the beauties in the place,— How pale is ev'ry lady's face, When the decisive moment's near, And from the strings all hands are clear, Like some bright meteor's flame on high, Self-moved, he soars towards the sky! When he arrives a mile in height, What then are mortals in his sight? All dwindle to a pigmy size, They look like emmets in his eyes. The steeples, halls, and verdant parks, Are in his view but little marks; The mountains seem but little hills, Broad rapid rivers look like rills,— And those alone who there have been, Can truly paint the circling scene. The air balloon a picture is Of man's most elevated bliss. As on the wings of hope he hastes, He finds all earthly pleasure wastes. The sweetest bliss that man enjoys In its possession only cloys; Though with good fortune for his gas He o'er the clouds of want may pass, Yet come a storm, the weakened air May drop him on a sea of care. The enthusiasts, who soar on high, And seem as if they'd grasp the sky, With reason weak, and fancy strong, Think all the sects but theirs are wrong; Condemn all creeds, and think that they Alone are heirs of endless day. They cling around their car of hopes, Till demon Nature cuts the ropes. As through this evil world they pass, And fierce temptations waste their gas, They downward fall—the phantom vain Comes rapid to the earth again: And when they can get breath to speak, They own they are but mortals weak. The playful boy, when young his hope, First forms his weak balloon with soap; With joy bright glitt'ring in his eyes, He views it from the tube arise, Dances and laughs to see it soar With Nature's colours painted o'er. Thus miniature balloons of boys Are emblems true of riper joys. The gay coquette, whose thoughts despise The sober youth, though e'er so wise, Becomes a spendthrift's mistress soon, And soars aloft in love's balloon. Through all the gayest scenes they pass,— Her marriage portion is the gas That bears them in the circle gay, And turns the midnight into day. But after all these golden hours, They find the air-borne chariot low'rs; Their lofty flight they then repent, For friends all fly from the descent, And those who envied them before, Rejoice to see their flying o'er. The dashing youth who sports along, Amid the wine, the dance, the song, The opera, the park, the ball, At Covent Garden and Vauxhall, Upon the turf, or at the ring, With gold enough, is just the thing. High in his atmosphere of pride In his balloon he loves to ride; While round his car the nymphs attend, His ample fortune help to spend. For ballast he no reason takes, Till debts increased the phantom shakes; He falls, amid the gloomy cloud Of creditors, and cries aloud,— “Could I but live past moments o'er, “Folly's balloon I'd mount no more!” The tyrant in his horrid car, Hung round with implements of war, While on its edge sit Rage and Death, And murder'd myriads lay beneath, Elately rides,—his flags unfurled, And waving o'er a prostrate world. The ruined empires see him pass, Pride and ambition for his gas; Despair below looks wildly up, And, frantic, drinks the pois'nous cup; Orphans and widows curse his flight, And Mercy, weeping, shuns the sight! When he to loftier heights would soar, His ballast is the warrior's gore, Which from his car the monster throws, And sprinkles on the field of woes; But He who rules above, looks down,— His lightnings blaze—the tyrant's crown Drops from his head,—his mighty car Is broken on the field of war! The wounded warriors join with all In joy to shout the tyrant's fall. The humble poet, oft, alas! Fills his balloon with fancy's gas; To see him launch it few attend, He just is aided by one friend, Who finds him ballast, silk, and ropes, And keeps alive his trembling hopes; Then loosed from earth and anxious care, Aloft he springs upon the air; With lofty themes his passions glow, The sordid world he views below; Through clouds he soars, and thinks he hears The heav'nly chorus of the spheres. He looks behind,—his fancy views Close to his car, the Tragic Muse; And, as in air he rides along, She charms him with her solemn song. Her car's adorned with sword and spear, The dagger and the scimitar; The pois'nous goblet,—broken crown, And palaces half tumbled down.— The bloody vest, the murdered maid, Are on the muse's car portrayed. The wide-stretched scene is spread below, Where rich meand'ring rivers flow! The flow'ry fields, the foaming seas, The mountains topped with waving trees; The dancing nymphs, the sportive swains, And crippled age, oppressed with pains.— Time present, past, and future, lies All spread before his fancy's eyes; While his enraptured passions glow, His lines in easy accents flow: But humble bards must soon descend, And in the shades their raptures end. MAN'S LIFE. I'll sing no more of cheerful things, My lyre shall mourn in pensive strain, The muse with tears shall wet her wings, And with her feeble voice complain: Grief shall her future hours employ— No more her features shine with joy; Each day and night will I declare— Man's little life's a life of care! Through every stage of life, what woe! What various forms can sorrow take! Pleasures may charm an hour or so, But sorrows ever are awake! Even infants, weeping at their birth, As if they feared the ills of earth, In feeble plaintive cries declare— Man's little life's a life of care! How oft we see the young at play Sore grieved and weeping o'er their toys; E'en in the morning of their day Are sorrows blended with their joys: Then 'tis best to take the cup, With resignation drink it up, Since of this truth we're well aware, Man's little life's a life of care! The youth on love's strong pinions soars Far—far beyond what he can gain, And sees the nymph his soul adores, Reject him, heedless of his pain; While she must feel love's painful dart, From one who slights her in his heart. Thus, disappointed youths declare— Man's little life's a life of care! Where is the busy tradesman's peace, When losses after losses come? His rising family increase, And ruin hastens to his home. O'ercome with grief, he sits and sighs, Broods o'er his sorrows in despair, Then, weeping, to his partner cries— Man's little life's a life of care! The sire, upon his crutches stayed, Weakened by age, disease, and pain; His grey locks tott'ring on his head, Declares the joys of earth are vain! His joyless nights are spent in sighs, His hearing lost, and dim his eyes: No hopes of shortest pleasure here, He dies—and leaves a life of care! A NIGHT SCENE. While others love the concert, mask, or ball, And walk in grandeur through the gazing crowd, I'll seek the spot where bursting cat'racts fall, And o'er my head the tempest roars aloud, While the deep dark abyss is murm'ring hoarse, That the swollen stream comes rushing with such force. There, when the moon's broad orb is glimmering seen Just rising in the orient atmosphere, And trembling leaves but thinly intervene, And all night's glories in full pomp appear,— Pensive I'll walk, to study nature o'er, And on the wings of meditation soar;— List to the treble rills, whose tinklings sweet Ring softly on the cavern's rocky side; Behold them with the larger current meet, Whose tenor murmurs on the stony tide; While the majestic bass the cat'ract roars, Like the deep notes of ocean on its shores! Such are the concerts that my soul admires; These I can hear with feelings of delight! A solemn awe my thoughtful breast inspires, When heav'n is decked by the great jeweller Night! Tis then my thoughts, on fancy's airy road, Soar far, and ask—“Where dwells great Nature's God?” The shining orbs responsive answer—“Here!” The twinkling glow-worms say by Him they shine! The loud abyss deep murmurs He is there! And ev'ry object shows a Pow'r Divine! Nature proclaims Him there, in ev'ry part, And conscience whispers—He can read my heart! PSALM XVIII. PARAPHRASED (from verses 6 to 16). When in the temple of his God In sorrow Israel's monarch prayed, Revenge!—the great Eternal vowed; The earth—the heav'ns were sore afraid! When frowned the Great Eternal King, All nature trembled at His look; Heav'n's choristers all ceased to sing, While the eternal pillars shook! Wild rolled the clouds of darkest hue, And wrapped the day in sable vest,— The affrighted sun his light withdrew, And thunders rolled from east to west! Earth trembled, and the ocean roar'd; The clouds all blush'd with cheeks of flame; Dread terrors veil'd the mountains o'er, And earthquakes shook old Nature's frame! The bending heav'ns obeisance made, As He on fiery cherubs rode; Beneath His feet the darkest shade Rolled as a chariot for its God! The stars had from their orbits fled, And melted all created things, Had not the darkness wrapped His head, As high He rode on whirlwinds' wings. The channels of the mighty deep,— The centre of the world was bare; The earth—the ocean could not keep Their stations, when their God was there! As heralds He the lightnings sent, The thunder was His trumpet strong; Devouring clouds before Him went,— Hail, fire, and storms flew swift along! His enemies His arrows felt, And as a shadow fled away: Thus Israel's foes to nothing melt, When faithful to their God they pray. PSALM CXIV. PARAPHRASED. When from proud Egypt's cruel land The Lord His people led, Encircling them on ev'ry hand, The sea beheld and fled. His holy place with Judah was, O'er Israel He reigned; The waters moved to let them pass, But Israel still complained. On either hand Jehovah made A wall across the deep; The mountains skipp'd, were sore afraid, The hills removed like sheep! Jordan roll'd backward to its source, And left its channel dry;— It durst not keep its wonted course, While Israel's God was nigh! When they within the desert prayed, And told their wants and fears, The flinty rocks in pity wept, And Israel drank their tears. Tremble then, earth, at Jacob's God, His holy name adore; Large as thou art, were He to nod, Thy place would be no more! PSALM CXLVIII. PARAPHRASED. Praise ye the Lord! let songs of praise Through highest heav'ns in chorus ring! Ye heights, where mortals cannot gaze, Adore your great eternal King! Ye angels, that are clothed in light, Ye hosts, which marshal at His word, Ascribe both majesty and night, In holy concert, to the Lord! Shine to His praise, thou glorious sun! And thou, pale moon, at midnight hour Adoring in thy orbit run And show thy great Creator's pow'r! Ye comets, too, which wand'ring far, And in the wide-stretched ether blaze, Tell ev'ry distant unknown star To join ye in Jehovah's praise! Ye stars, beheld by mortal eyes, For ever steadfast, fixed and true, The anthem join—till praise arise From all the wide extended blue! Ye heav'ns beyond the heav'ns, rejoice! In praise, ye unknown oceans, roar, Which heard at first th' Almighty's voice Bid you to last for evermore! Fixed in His great eternal throne, By an unchangeable decree, To last when ev'ry orb is gone, Existing through eternity! Ye mountains, lift your heads on high; In praise toward His throne ascend! Praise Him, ye lesser hills! reply In awe, ye oaks,—ye cedars, bend! Ye fruitful trees, wave ev'ry bough, With blossoms or with fruit arrayed! By ev'ry shrub that blooms below, Let homage to His name be paid! Thou earth, in songs thy glory give,— One universal Sabbath keep: With all that in the ocean live, And monsters of th' unfathomed deep. Ye clouds, that crown the mountain's brow, Fraught with the lightning's vivid blaze, To distant thunders, deep and low, Echo on high His awful praise! Ye storms of hail, that ride along, On the wild wings of tempests borne, Learn in the air the holy song, And with it to the earth return! Learn it, ye snows! and ev'ry cloud That sails in grandeur on the air! Ye whirlwinds, bear His praise abroad, And His tremendous pow'r declare! Lions, which in the desert roar, And all the mighty beasts of prey That range the unknown forests o'er, To Him your nightly homage pay! Ye creeping reptiles, weak and small, By man unnoticed and unknown, Show forth His skill—He formed you all, Ye live by Him and Him alone! Ye larks, ascending toward the sky, Ye birds, which warble in the wood, With all the various fowls that fly, Tune your wild notes in praise to God! Praise Him, ye kings, by mortals crowned; And ye who judge by earthly law: Let songs in ev'ry court resound; Ye princes, bend your plumes in awe! Ye youths, His sacred name adore; Ye maidens, on His glories gaze; Old men, whose earthly joys are o'er, And infant children, shout His praise! To God, the great eternal King (For He alone deserves all praise), Let joyful hallelujahs ring Through all creation's boundless space! The glorious lustre of the sky Is darkness to th' eternal light Wherein He dwells enthroned on high, Below all depth—above all height. Praise Him, ye saints! though last, the best; Ye whom He still delights to raise To bliss, and crown you with the blessed, Close by His throne to sing His praise! SOLEMN REFLECTIONS. My life wastes away, o'erburden'd with care; My days are o'erclouded with gloom; I'm toss'd through the night on the verge of despair, And shudder to think on the tomb. When backward I look, nought but folly and sin Have been my employment below; I've err'd from the way I should have walk'd in, And run in the high road to woe. The strength of my passions has hurried me on, Until I've run so far astray: I'm afraid ev'ry beam of Heaven's mercy is gone, And my bosom too harden'd to pray! Shall the blessings, the threat'nings, the sermons I've heard, Against me in judgment arise? Or in vain mortal pride shall I question the Word Which points to a crown in the skies? The time soon will come when all I have read Will be lost in the thoughts of the grave; And my tongue, which so many light verses has said, Will be asking for mercy to save— To save a lost soul which has stray'd from the road Wherein it once ran with delight— Which has sought lying vanities rather than God, And, like Samson, is robb'd of its might. If yet there is mercy, O may I return To Him who is mercy above! In deepest repentance, O Lord! let me mourn, And this rock from my bosom remove.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Love Poetry. THE ABSENT LOVER. In vain the youths and rosy maids All wish me to be gay, For health declines, and pleasure fades, While Henry's far away. The birds may strain their warbling throats, Upon the blossom'd spray, But there's no music in their notes, When Henry's far away. The sweets of June, the hill, the dale, With nature's beauties gay, Appear to me but winter pale, When Henry's far away. The evening moments creep but slow, And dull's the brightest day; For none my anxious cares can know, When Henry's far away. My trembling harp no pleasure yields, My hands forget to play; No joy at home, nor in the fields, While Henry's far away. The hours which now I think my best, I wish them not to stay; For nought on earth can make me rest, While Henry's far away. Pháeton, cord afresh thy whip, And on thy coursers lay, To make them o'er thy azure skip, While Henry's far away. And, Night, upon thy sable throne, Be scarce an hour thy stay: But bid the weeks be swiftly gone, While Henry's far away. Then, on the wings of rosy Health May he be swiftly borne; For more to me than worlds of wealth Will be his blest return. THE DYING LOVER. Ah! soon, sweet maid, this heart of mine Will give its beating o'er; This weary aching head recline Upon thy breast no more. These hands can pluck no more for thee The heather's purple bloom; No more must I accompany My lovely Mary home. But, hush!—those sighs of fragrant breath, The lovely crystal tear, Can no impression make on Death, Or keep me longer here. Go, touch my sweet piano's strings, And chant me into rest, Till angels come, and on their wings Convey me to the blest. And mourn not as I soar away To tune my harp on high; Useless the tears upon my clay, For I'm prepared to die. LOVE ON THE HEATH. On the heath-vestur'd hills, where I courted my Sally, Like stars was the bloom on the cranberry stalk; The wild birds, unknown to the throng-peopled valley, Were all that could see us or listen our talk. The pale yellow moss on the side of the mountain, Far softer than velvet, invited our stay; And there by the rock, from whose foot gush'd the fountain, We, innocent, lov'd the sweet moments away. How oft she would say, when sat happy together, “'Tis thee—and thee only I ever can love!” With breath far more sweet than the bloom on the heather, Her eyes far more comely than those of the dove. How oft had she vowed, while we walked o'er the rushes, With me, and me only she'd wander so far, Then bent down her head with such beautiful blushes,— 'Twas Modesty's hand that had painted them there. On the heath thus we lov'd, and our love so delicious— If Heaven e'er bless'd any mortals below, It gave them such moments, unknown to the vicious, Which only in innocent bosoms can glow! But oh! how the pleasures of mortals are clouded, For Sally the heather-bells blossom no more! With the cold robe of death my charmer is shrouded, And I on the heath must behold her no more! ON LOVE. The love how true—the love how sweet, That is in youth begun, When innocence and beauty meet, That never lov'd but one! No anxious doubts, no jealous fears, Disturb the constant breast; The faithful youth, whose vows are truth, With one alone is bless'd. Let other suitors come—her heart From him she never moves; Nor aught on earth but death can part Her soul from him she loves. If angels smile at aught on earth, They smile on love like this, Whose origin's of heav'nly birth,— The crown of mortal bliss; The sweetest flower that blooming grows Amongst the thorns of care; The balm that heals our bosoms' woes, And yields contentment there. Such is that love which Heav'n bestow'd To make its creatures bless'd; And such in our first parents glow'd, When Eden they possess'd. LOVE SANS REASON. Wild's the night, my love, my Mary! But I promised thee to meet; Winds and rain they sound so dreary, Yet thou list'nest for my feet! Dark the woods which lie between us, High the rocks I have to pass, Where the nymphs and swains have seen us, Each one happy with his lass. Frail's the plank across the river, Slipp'ry with a night of rain; One false step—I'm gone for ever, Ne'er to meet my love again! Swoll'n the streams of ev'ry fountain, Trackless is the stormy moor, Capp'd with mist the lofty mountain Which I have to wander o'er. Though the winds be cold and dreary, I have promis'd thee to meet; If I reach my love, my deary, 'Twill but make our bliss more sweet! What the rocks or misty mountains? What the darkness of the woods? What the roaring of the fountains, Though the rills be swoll'n to floods? What the trackless moor or river, Though some demon should appear? Can those stop me? Oh no,—never! Three short hours will land me there. Then my plaid I will throw o'er me, Sing of Mary on the way; Though great dangers lie before me, Yet I cannot, will not stay. I WILL LOVE THEE, MARY! While the larks mount up in spring, While the grouse sport on the ling, While the thrush and blackbird sing, I will love thee, Mary! While the heat of summer glows On each daisy, pink, and rose,— Come sweet pleasure or deep woes, I will love thee, Mary! When the harvest field appears Yellow with the golden ears,— Bless'd with joys, or press'd with cares, I will love thee, Mary! In the coldest winter's frost, On the drifted mountain lost, Or on foaming billows toss'd, I will love thee, Mary! Life may waste,—but still impress'd Are thy virtues on my breast; Till in death my heart shall rest, I will love thee, Mary! MARY, I WILL THINK OF YOU. Tune—“In a cottage near a wood.” When upon the heather bloom First appears the evening dew, When the daisies close their eyes, Mary, I will think of you. When the woodland doves I hear, On the budding birchen bough, While the thrush is singing clear, Mary, I will think of you. When I hear the evening chime, While soft echo answers true, Though at midnight's solemn time, Mary, I will think of you. When upon the orient skies Morning spreads her pinky hue, When I wake, before I rise, Mary, I will think of you. When among the heather bells, Rousing up the wild curlew, Where the wildest music swells, Mary, I will think of you. On the banks of Windermere, 'Mid fair scenes for ever new, Then I wish'd my Mary there, Sharing ev'ry changing view. When my bark must leave the shore, Yet, unchang'd, my heart is true; Singing to the well-tim'd oar, I'll drop a tear and think of you. When my bark is far away, Nought but seas and skies in view, Ploughing through the wat'ry way, Mary, I will think of you. ODE TO LAURA. Softly sighing will I mourn The blossom that was nipp'd in spring, Hang a chaplet on the urn Of lovely Virtue's blossoming. O'er her no praise shall marble bear, Those pageants vain of solemn pride; Though all on earth I held most dear, Forsook me when my Laura died. Oh! 'tis in vain—I'll cease to try To write in characters my sorrow deep, For could I write a river dry, My eyes another sea could weep. But words can never show the worth Of her who was too rich to stay, Mourning on a joyless earth, When fit for everlasting day. TRUE AFFECTION. The face of Henry faded fast, The fever next in crimson came; Each weary day was thought the last, For furious was the fever's flame. Eliza heard, Eliza sighed, And often of the youth inquired; Her vow was given, and she his bride Was all she wished on this side heav'n. She heard the croaking raven cry, Her lovely eyes of sleep bereft; She thought—If now my Henry die, There's nought for me but sorrow left. The fair was there, and all was mirth, The viols and all music play; But not a joy was left on earth— These were to Henry flown away. Now, Henry's father, he was proud, And scorned Eliza, she was poor; He vowed his son should wear a shroud Ere he should see Eliza more. The fever raged, till every one That nursed the youth was laid near death; The father durst not see his son, But feared contagion from his breath. Yet Henry's mother never moved, Stayed with the youth, and would not move; When all relations say, “We loved,” Where is such truth as mothers' love? 'Twas midnight, and the winds were strong, Henry insensible to pain, His pulse not likely to beat long, Nor his parched tongue to speak again. The storm beat hard against the door, The eaves-drops fell both loud and fast, The lightning blazed amid the shower, When, lo! a virgin's form went past. His mother trembled at the sight, Then looked if Henry yet had breath; The form that passed in purest white, She thought the messenger of death. We need not lengthen out the tale; It was Eliza came to pray, Amid the storm of rain and hail, That she might with her Henry stay. She spoke, but spoke as in despair, “Is yet my Henry's spirit here? O let me stay! I will not care, Though death in every form appear.” Softly in grief the mother spoke, “Eliza, why in such a plight?” She says, “My heart will sure be broke, If I see not your son to-night.” The mother's pity melted then, She softly crept towards the door; She let the storm-drenched maiden in— She came, but home returned no more. All dropping she to Henry flew, In time to catch his parting breath, That kiss she to her bosom drew, And soon with him was lain in death. THE DESERTED MAID. To some gloomy cave will I wander away, Where waterfalls foam through each cleft, And there shun the light of the pleasant spring day, Since I by my lover am left. There hang, ye dried ferns, in the wet gloomy shade, Ye owls, fly around me in scorn, As ye hoot at a maid by her lover betray'd, Whose features with weeping are worn. Oh let not a flower be seen in the field, Nor daisies spring up near my feet; Thou beautiful hill, no more primroses yield, Where my lover and I used to meet. Ye eglantines, keep your sweet scent in the bud, Nor throw it away to the wind; Ye hyacinths, blossom no more in the wood, Where I on his bosom reclin'd. But wither, like me, ev'ry cowslip and rose, Nor bloom in your beauty and charms, As you did when this bosom knew nothing of woes, Lull'd to peace in a false lover's arms. Ye stockdoves I fed in the cold chilling frost, Let your cooings be accents of pain, In woe sing, ye birds, that my lover is lost, Till the grottos re-echo the strain. The gems that he bought in my bosom I'll bear, I only the jewels will view, And dim their bright lustre with many a tear, Which springs from a bosom that's true. When life has ebb'd out to the last fatal day, And this bosom heaves feebly for breath, If then I can speak, for my Edwin I'll pray, And show that I lov'd him in death. A CALM SUMMER'S NIGHT. The night is calm, the cygnet's down Scarce skims the lake along; The throstle to the hazel's flown, To trill his evening song. The curling woodbine now appears More sweet than fragrant gums, The sky a robe of crimson wears, The scale-clad beetle hums. What pleasure, walking with my Jane, Earth's truest, best delight, Returning to embrace again, And loath to bid good night. A FRAGMENT. ALCASTO. Banish the wealthless virgin from thy thoughts! Or eminence and wealth are from thee far As from the beggar is the monarch's crown. REGINALD. Break nature's laws, and send me to the world In my worst suit, no king in miniature, Stamped on rich ore, to be my passport through, I'll love her still! Our passions now are mixed, As are the waters of two meeting rills. Ours is superior love, as rarely found As is the phœnix burning on her nest. I saw and loved her when she rowed along, The lake unruffled, save with her white skiff. Had she been absent there, I could have seen, Upon the bosom of the polished lake, Inverted trees, and rocks, and crimson clouds, Tinged with the lustre of the setting sun; But all I now remember seemed a sky, And she like Dian on th' inverted arch, Skimming in modest majesty along— With her she took my heart: and can your wealth, Your honours, influence, or wide estates, Purchase a form as fair, a richer skiff; Give to another nymph that voice I heard, Teach Myra's song, and make such echoes join? Do these—her image I will strive t' efface, Though painted on the canvas of my heart. ALCASTO. Is not Romilia more lovely far, Possessing wealth, and modesty, and wit; So virtuous, that the night's unhealthy wind Blasts not her cheeks to make her blushes fade? REGINALD. Know you my Myra's worth? Has Slander spoke! No—earth's three darkest demons all are mute. She takes her soft guitar, and sings so sweet, That gloomy, callous-hearted Envy weeps, Shrinks to the shades where meagre Malice sits; But both are charmed, their vices lose, and gaze Upon her beauty, and return to praise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miscellaneous Poems. THE COMMERCE OF BRADFORD. (written in 1820.) Hail, glorious Commerce! goddess of our isle! Thou, who hast rais'd her to the tow'ring height Where, thron'd she sits, the empress of the world,— Britannia's glory, hail! of thee I sing: Thou, who with swiftest pinions wing'st thy way To every distant port throughout the seas, Then back return'st, with every blessing fraught The kingdoms of the fruitful earth can yield. Thou hast a daughter, whose industrious hands Supply the earth with stuffs of richest hues, In which are dress'd the sultan and the slave,— Princes and Kings, Jews, Pagans, Turk, and Priest, The Indian ladies and the Persian dames,— Bradford her name, now known throughout the world. Small was her fame, her trade and wealth were small, When, from a few thatch'd cottages she rose, To form a street, the shadow of a town; But view her now—behold her bursting forth In far extending streets, majestic built, Wherein the mould'ring bricks are seldom seen, While polish'd stones compose her rising walls, And, speak in silent accents, through our land— Where Commerce reigns, old England's sons are bless'd! Oh what a change in this most favour'd town, Since its brave sons lay lifeless on the field, With gory wounds, by civil discord dealt— Scenes almost now forgotten and unknown— When trembling virgins sought their lovers brave, And on their mangled bosoms, frantic, wept; While mothers mingled with the streaming blood Tears of deep anguish and unutter'd woe On the soak'd earth where their dear sons were slain. When peace return'd, and civil discord ceas'd, On Bradford, then, the sun of Commerce dawn'd: But faint and few its beams.—Few were the goods Which then, with toil and weary steps, were brought On the jaded pack-horse to the little town,— A public house the only piece-hall was, And one small table held the merchant's store. Behold, how chang'd! so many now her goods, That she can form a zone to gird the world; With rich moreens, can deck the Russian court; In lighter goods adorn the Japanese; Can far outshine the tint of Persian dyes, And clothe the world from Zembla's coldest shores, To hottest tracts of Afric's sultry plains. When envious minds, by proud presumption curs'd, With dire seditious trash the country fill'd, Aiming to shake the basis of our throne, Drew thousands into error and to shame, Old Bradford stood,—yes, like its motto, stood, Which deck'd the banner of the volunteers, “Ready” to arm, and “steady” to the king. While bless'd with Commerce, Bradford never dreads Pale-visag'd poverty, nor meagre want; Her sons are free, and, when in war engag'd, Their wealth and hearts are open to the king: Freely they give—as freely as they join The joyful shouts, when vict'ry crowns our hosts, And England echoes with triumphant joy. Bless'd is that king, who, in his subjects' hearts, Has fix'd the steadfast basis of respect! Then let rebellion rise—'tis crush'd at once; Or let proud hostile fleets loom on our seas, And foreign foes approach with ev'ry wind, While on each deck their glist'ning arms are seen, Our constitution, commerce, and our king Become the trumpets that arouse our souls: The king our Jove, our constitution Mars, Our trade Minerva, and our God our shield, And, led by chiefs to English bosoms dear,— The threat'ning fleets, whatever flags they bear, Soon spread the bottom of the trembling deeps With wreeks and trophies of their shatter'd pride! Oh that my feeble pen could half describe The num'rous blessings Bradford's sons enjoy! In chill December's cold and piercing nights, When all the diamonds of yon spangled arch Shine brilliant through the air, by frost made pure,— When the bright moonbeams on the candied snow, Create unnumber'd gems of ev'ry hue, And beautify the scene,—then is the time The starv'd inhabitants of heath-crown'd hills Cling round the shimm'ring light of turfy fires; And, as they shudder with the piercing blast That penetrates their crazy tenements, Oft wish that coals were near, but wish in vain.— But, blest with her exhaustless mines of coal, Were Bradford plac'd where mitred hills of snow Raise their white heads beyond the Arctic line, Where the green sea is one vast wild of ice, She would defy a winter at the pole. Prompted by Commerce, in the summer months, When bleating flocks are lighten'd of their load, The manufacturers and staplers seek, Through ev'ry shire, the farmer's woolly store, Happy employment!—when, beneath the shade Of lofty trees, the shepherd shears his sheep, While, smiling o'er the group, his master stands, And hears with joy the shearer's festive song, Pours out the ale, and joins their rustic mirth; Then makes them wrap, with honesty, each fleece, Which, when unloos'd, may like his heart be found, Nought to contain but equity and truth. T' augment the pleasure of the rural scene, After a year of absence, now arrives From marts of commerce his accustom'd friend. Upon the carpet of the verdant earth, With joy the long-tried friends together meet, Admire the fleece—the source of England's wealth— Which all the climates of the world beside Can ne'er surpass in quality and strength. The farmer's blooming daughter, too, is there, Blushing with modesty and virgin grace, Great Nature's self the painter of her cheeks:— The stapler's youthful and enamour'd son Sees all the world a blank but her fair form; While from her eyes the swift-wing'd darts of love Fly quick, and pierce his inexperienc'd heart. Poor youth!—he, like a ship with colours gay, Just launch'd upon the ocean of the world, Knows nothing of its tempests and its storms, But thinks the main as tranquil as the port. Meanwhile the fathers bargain for the wool; The price is asked—'tis set—disputed—giv'n; And soon the swelling sheets are homeward sent, And half the vessels that the Humber bears, Are fraught with wool, Britannia's wealth and boast. When at its destin'd place 'tis landed safe, The sorter first consigns each various kind, With nice exactness, to its proper bin— Emblem of man! who, in this chequer'd world, According to appearance takes his place; The great to palaces, the proud to courts; To fine-built mansions some, and some to huts Lowly and mean, yet fill'd with greatest peace, Their residence like bins where wool is thrown; And the partition which divides each class, Death soon breaks down, commixing ev'ry sort. The comber next employs his ancient art, Which no machinery can supersede. In 1820, it was the general opinion that no machine could ever supersede hand-combing. In vain the ingenious stretch their utmost skill: As oft as tried, the expensive schemes of art Abortive prove;—the comber still employ'd, Sings at his work, and triumphs o'er them all; Then plans for ale; and when the quart goes round, Talks of his travels, happier than a king. The spinners, too, in times which now are pass'd, With many a weary step spun out the yarn, Singing to pass the tedious hours away; Or on the pleasant evenings of the spring, Tranquillity pervading all the scene, Upon the verdant earth their wheels were plied; And village spinsters, with their rural songs, Charm'd their lov'd swains, and labour turn'd to joy.— But now, with wheels as num'rous as the stars, With motion multiform as heavenly spheres, The invention of the skill'd mechanic's mind, Our wool has drawn out to the finest thread, Unequall'd in the world. But time would fail Minutely to describe each process of our trade. May Bradford's Commerce prosper still, Her greastest boast, her glory, and her all! Let Commerce flourish, then we stand secure— Destroy it, and the seas defend in vain From foreign foes Britannia's favour'd isle. LOW MOOR IRON WORKS. Ye that have trembled with the nerves unstrung, The theme neglected which you should have sung; With fearful gloom the mind encircled round, Or sunk in fears amid the deep profound; Pardon the timid mind that now indites, The pen that trembles as your poet writes. 'Tis not of stars, nor distant orbs I sing, Parnassus' mountain, nor the muses' spring; Nor smoking Ætna, nor the constant light Of Strombolo, that gilds Sicilian night. A thousand wants, a thousand fears are mine, A bard that has to struggle for the Nine; But hence, ye cares—anxieties avaunt— Be drown'd, ye sorrows, and be banish'd, want; False fancied ills, disturb no more this breast, For whilst I treat of genius I'm blest. When first the shapeless sable ore Is laid in heaps around Low Moor, The roaring blast, the quiv'ring flame, Give to the mass another name: White as the sun the metal runs, For horse-shoe nails, or thund'ring guns; The trembling hair-spring of a watch, An anchor, or a cottage latch— Most implements the farmers have, And those of steamers on the wave; The tailor's needle, or the shell That levell'd once where princes dwell; The engine, boiler, cobbler's awl, The carronade, the pond'rous ball; The place where steam first moves his wings, The nails in beggars' shoes and kings'; The anchor's chain, the fisher's hook, The sword—the hatchet—and the crook, The sounding anvil, all the blades, The cause of many thousand trades; No pen can write, no mind can soar To tell the wonders of Low Moor. Wrapp'd in dark clouds that curling rise on high, Mix'd with the quiv'ring flames of ev'ry dye, Noble in blackness, great, and wide, and deep, Not like mankind, thou never art asleep; Thy sun-white flames for years have been awake, Thy mighty hammers all the mountains shake— Here from the mine, as when Mount Ida's flame Lighted the coal, and liquid iron came; Thy coal, thy stone, and Craven's flinty rock, Join'd with the powerful blasts, the hammer's shock, Mould into masses, which shall ever stand, Or to improve, or to defend our land. In every clime, through every varied zone, Throughout the world thy heavy guns are known: From the Pacific to the Indian shore, Nations have heard their dread tremendous roar. Here, wond'ring strangers, while they view around, See mighty moulds promisc'ous on the ground: Struck with astonishment they wildly gaze, Amid thy thunders and each quiv'ring blaze. Here lie the cannon, peaceful, all asleep, Which yet shall thunder on the mighty deep; The mortars there, and bombs of every size, Which yet with flames shall streak the distant skies. The place where armour by the gods was form'd, Ere round old Troy the Grecian warriors storm'd, Was silent to the echoes of each stroke, And noise of hammers, heard amid thy smoke. Here pow'rful levers raise the pond'rous guns, And pulleys, where a boy can play with tons. How slow, yet sure, the boring wheels appear, And soon the new-form'd cannon glitters there; But should a flaw within the piece be found, When it has mov'd ten thousand times around, Soon with the massive ball, the piece is broke— The whole foundation trembles with the stroke. Since thy first smoke arose and infant blast, What hosts have fled, what hostile days have pass'd— What guns once thine are buried in the deep, Where anchors, balls, and many a sailor, sleep; Their fury quench'd in ocean's deepest bed, With worlds of billows rolling o'er the dead. Thy strong artill'ry, which at Woolwich lies— Should its arsenal once in fury rise, Nations would tremble, fleets and navies fly, For there Britannia stores her thunder by— There pyramids of balls for battle form'd, By which each fortress of our foes is storm'd; The bursting bombs of every size are there, To guard the land Britannia holds so dear. When Romans sway'd the sceptre o'er this land. Near some small brook the infant blast was fann'd; The boughs of trees were cut to melt the ore, Cent'ries ere Britons heard a cannon roar. But what a change—in sixteen hundred years, No more the flinty or the brazen spears; The art of war to such perfection grown, Death flies on air, and sweeps whole squadrons down. But let the dead the iron balls have slain In dust among the warriors remain; These times of peace require a milder song, Than when through carnage armies march along: The days are past when dreadful terror smil'd, The useless balls are rusting where they're pil'd, Silent the cannon, peaceful all the hosts, And long eighteens now form a line of posts. Thousands of these that on the batt'ry spoke, To form a railway, will be shortly broke; The rusty engines that for years have stood, Shall be conducive to the public good— Castings of old machin'ry shall be sought, Melted again and into action brought; The rapid wheels far fleeter than the wind, Shall leave the show'r in distance far behind. Swift as the rapid stock-dove, engines fly, Gliding as smooth as meteors in the sky: The shining salmon, near the Mersey caught, With wings of steam shall be so swiftly brought, The poor can buy them when they get so cheap, And show their freshness as they try to leap. The grocer, when his sugar is all sold, When coffee's out—if he has got the gold, May breakfast in old Leeds—the paper take, And land in Liverpool without a shake; His lunch at Manchester may take at ten, Buy goods in Dale Street—then home again— His goods all safe, he guards them on the way, No lessen'd weight, and not one hour delay. Ye panting horses, smoking on the road, Mark'd with the whip, and struggling with your load; Your race of cruelty will soon have done, The mail without you soon will swiftly run, The useless coaches, which have made you tire, Shall form a sofa near some kitchen fire; The Courier, Pilot, or the Duke of Leeds, May cross the furrows fill'd with various seeds, A load of turnips for the sheep convey, Or bear the cattle, through the snow, some hay. But see the engine on the railroad play, Two hundred tons force swiftly on the way! The Menai Bridge was late a wonder thought, The greatest work mechanics ever wrought! But locomotive power all else transcends, And every proof the first endeavour mends— Of much more use the cannon then will be, Molten again, than roaring on the sea: The world at peace, and commerce spreading far, Nor dread of ruin, from the deeds of war. O had I genius! that, Low Moor, to thee The debt of gratitude should then be paid: But care and grief, and deep anxiety, Have thrown poetic vigour into shade. Place of true genius, where invention springs, And where the mathematics spread their wings: Where swift revolve, like motion of the spheres, The potent wheels, and all their pow'r appears; A moving wonder!—where all things are brought To such perfection, they o'erpow'r the thought— Steady and swift the pond'rous masses turn, And with their weight the solid axles burn. Matur'd by sage experience, here combine, And first of genius—great Low Moor, is thine! Firm perseverance, and a master's skill, Through change of time, have conquer'd every ill. Thy fame for noblest engines far is known, Where greatest skill and high perfection's shown; Strong to propel the vessels on the sea, Or move ten thousand wheels in harmony. Strength of our commerce, these are truly fix'd, Where coal and ironstone are richly mix'd, In mines of wealth, an unexhausted store, Such as for ages yet shall bless Low Moor. What millions sterling have been made, What tens of thousands have been paid, What thousands here has genius fed, Since the first blast has rear'd its head, Crown'd with the flame that soar'd on high, And cheer'd the midnight cloudy sky. But for Low Moor, old Bradford town, Had never like a city grown, Her streets so wide had never spread, Nor Commerce rais'd so high her head; In days, and years, and times gone by, Had not her sable coal been nigh— Oh! for a Milton's pen—a Milton's mind, To tell what friendship all the brothers bind. When winter comes, and shining nature sees The frost hang hoary on the naked trees, Amid the blackness, there is yet one charm, In frost and winter storms, thy sons are warm; How blest the workmen, though the labour's hard, Their wages sure—the poor man's best reward; Cheerful they sing, their labour is delight; Blest with their families, at home at night— While some uncertain, with an aching breast, Far from their wives and children, take no rest; O useful labour, mine of richest wealth, Man's truest friend, the keeper of his health. APPEAL OF THE SPANISH REFUGEES. The brave band of Mina's no more! Riego is laid in the grave! Iberia's freedom is o'er,— 'Tis now but the land of the slave! The grapes need not hang on the vine, The orange nor lemon appear; Let riches remain in the mine, For many a traitor is there! Ye warriors of Albion! could we But march in your columns to Spain, The coward—the traitor would flee, And liberty triumph again! But now from our country afar, For the loss of our freedom we mourn; Who once were the first in the war, And scorned like the traitor to turn! Freedom's banners we once bore on high, And then were of warriors the pride; But now are we forced to fly From the home—from the arms of the bride. Now humbly we make the appeal To the sons of blest liberty's isle; Our wants they in sympathy feel, And anguish is changed to a smile! Oh what are Iberia's fields, Or what are the grapes on the vine, To the joy which true liberty yields? And, Britain, such blessings are thine! Our struggle for freedom is o'er; The learned—the wealthy—the brave, Have fled from Iberia's shore,— 'Tis now but the land of the slave! ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF LORD BYRON. The greatest bard is fall'n that ever strung The mighty lyre that swell'd from hell to heav'n,— The sweetest minstrel mute that ever sung, Since from the skies Apollo's harp was giv'n! Though little minds may not lament his fall, Nor bring one flow'r to form the mournful wreath— He needs no wreath! for Fame has wove it all; Wet with her tears—it blossoms at his death! Its amaranthine leaves through time shall bloom, Beyond the reach of Envy's ruthless hand! Love, Liberty, and Genius guard his tomb, And weeping there shall Grecian Freedom stand. He sung of storms, and of the tempest wave,— No theme on earth his mighty pen passed by; From victory's height—down to the warrior's grave, From earth's dark centre to the lofty sky! Ye minor bards, unstring the feeble lyre! Nor strive in Byron's lofty verse to mourn: Four mighty poets only had the fire Homer, Virgil, Shakespeare, and Milton. Fit to inscribe the lines beneath his urn! LINES SPOKEN AT THE ANNIVERSARY MEETING AT LEEDS, TO CELEBRATE THE BIRTHDAY OF BURNS, 1826. Learning has many a rhymer made, To flatter near the throne, But Scotia's genius has displayed A poet of her own. His lyre he took to vale and glen, To mountain and to shade; Cent'ries may pass away, but when Will such a lyre be play'd? His native strains each bard may try, But who has got his fire? Why, none—for Nature saw him die, Then took away his lyre. And for that lyre the learned youth May search the world in vain: She vowed she ne'er would lend it more To sound on earth again; But called on Fame to hang it by— She took it with a tear, Broke all the strings to bind the wreath That Burns shall ever wear. ON THE DEATH OF THE POET'S CHILD IN LONDON. A solemn scene was here! Absorb'd in anguish wild, Weeping upon the bier Of his departed child, The father stood—parental grief was there— He kiss'd the corse—a prey to sad despair. O Death! O cruel Death! In fearful garb array'd, How could'st thou snatch the breath Of this sweet babe, here laid! See, see thy victim! on her cold pale face, A smile yet dwells, though clasp'd in thy embrace. Clos'd are those sparkling eyes: Fled is my baby's bloom; Her cherub form now lies Enshrouded for the tomb. Martha is gone—has breath'd her last—her thread Of life is spun—is snapp'd;—the babe is dead. Angels! take her soul above, And, as you bear her through the sky, Sing a seraph's song of love, A song of heav'nly harmony. Now let celestial music sound, Strike, strike the lyre! ye heav'nly choir! Angelic music breathe around! ON RETURNING FROM LONDON. How oft the glorious morning broke On rock-crown'd hills—Time's paintings grey— When from his bed the lark awoke, And warbled to the clouds his lay. The hills rejoice—with glory blush, Like gold the crystal rivers shine, The blackbird carols with the thrush,— Sweet Bingley vale, such scenes are thine; And such they were when all its woods Had bow'd not to the woodman's stroke, When salmon in its winding floods, The smooth still deeps to surges broke. Give me a cot, a garden near, By kindred silent in the tomb; Should greatest monarch ask me where, I'd answer—this shall be my home. The works of art I oft have seen, The touches of a master's hand, But never like the hills so green, Or Alpine rocks of Cumberland. See the pale features of the town, With all their fine exterior grace,— Though deck'd with jewels and a crown, To Yorkshire lasses must give place. Then be content, 'tis always best, From wives, from neighbours, ne'er remove; It takes long years to try the breast, Then who can judge a stranger's love? The eagles mounting to the sun, While on the rocks the ravens cry, As goats along the ledges run, And falcons perch with piercing eye:— These have we seen, and may we long Gaze on each native hill and vale; And listen to the rural song, And smile to hear our children's tale. WAKENING OF THE POET'S HARP. With harmony of numbers that smoothly floats along, Like the softest harp of nature with the winds its strings among; Then stronger in his measure and bolder in his rhyme, Unfolding all his treasure like the evening's swelling chime. He wakens then the echo as in grander verse he sings, And louder and still louder he strikes the quivering strings; His rhyme is growing bolder, as he cheerily strikes the lyre; His muse he cannot hold her, she mounts on wings of fire. She leaves all earthly grandeur and o'er the hills she soars— What cares he then for slander when every star adores: Here, singing strains unborrowed, the poet's verse can claim A wreath that's everlasting, of never-dying fame. In his own path of glory he sweetly chants along, And every son of genius can comprehend his song; Beyond the reach of slander he sings in loftier strains, His verse has greater grandeur as higher heights he gains: Till lost in the creation—surrounded by its gems— He sees the heaven of heavens bedeck'd with diadems; And though sometimes in sorrow despised and turned to shame, He wins his wreath of glory, composed of endless fame. FROM A MOTHER TO HER DAUGHTER IN LONDON. How thoughtful oft I sit alone, My only child, and think of thee; I bear thee to th' Almighty's throne, Whene'er in prayer I bow the knee. A mother's blessings and her prayers, Are more than words can e'er express; A father's love, a father's cares, Though less display'd, are still no less. The midnight hour oft comes and goes, And tells the death of each short day; I hear it oft before I close Mine eyes, while thou art far away. But why should I o'er this complain? For many a friend with God is there; Thou art not lost amid the main, As many a mother's daughters are. Thou hast not with the worthless fled, On folly's miserable way; No word arrives, “Your Betsy's dead,” In distant climes, far, far away. But, blest with health, O let us praise The Lord! and not repine and mourn; For swiftly pass away the days, Which bring my daughter's dear return. Then I again shall hear her sing, In mutual labour's sweet employ, While Time flies swiftly on the wing, And evenings pass away with joy. When there is so much good and ill,— O may the good by her be lov'd! May heav'nly wisdom guide her will, And may she bring a mind improv'd. LINES WRITTEN IN SICKNESS. Lovely darlings! can you dry The sweat-drops from your father's brow? Can you wipe his faded eye, Sunk with pain and sickness low? Oh! my little prattling boy, Gladly thou would'st ease my pain; Pleased, would'st give thy father joy, But thy infant arts are vain. Must I leave you here to mourn, With a mother deep distress'd, While I to the dust am borne, Where this aching head shall rest? Yes! methinks I hear you say, “Mother, when will father come? “Why is he so long away, “Nor brings his weekly wages home?” Must I leave you?—O thou Pow'r Supreme! who seest the orphan's tears, Guard them through each infant hour, Watch them in maturer years! IMPROMPTU. Did my estates extend for miles around, And in my mansion all things great abound; Did gold enrich me, or did rubies shine; Were greatest titles, wealth, and honour, mine; Though crystal rivers through my pastures run, Reflecting back the glories of the sun; Were beauteous gardens mine, and ev'ry breeze Brought fragrant odours from the spicy trees; Did high majestic hills the landscape grace, And finest scenes adorn great Nature's face, In sweet variety of hill and dale; The crystal fountain and the fruitful vale; And cloak'd in ivy were the ancient towers, And sweet enchantment us'd her utmost powers:— Nor my estates, my titles, wealth, nor fame, The breath of honour, nor the greatest name; Nor high majestic hills, nor flow'ry vale, Nor crystal rivers, winding through the dale; Nor all that Nature, all that Art can give, Nor merriest life a mortal e'er can live, Can make me bless'd when this short life shall end, Unless my Maker prove to be my friend. IMPROMPTU ON A LANDLORD. Beneath this stone lies Harry Rinder, Whose heart would light as soon as tinder; And a bright spark from beauty's eye Kindle his soul to ecstasy. At length he took a loving wife, And then commenced a landlord's life; And all the time he was a brewer, No man to wife was ever truer. Death came at last and made him quail, And conscience spoke about his ale: Had he sent tippling souls to ruin By putting drugs in every brewing? Then truth of blame did Harry clear; For never, in his ale or beer, Did he put berries, drugs, or drops, But simply water, malt, and hops. LINES TO A FRIEND. Where's my harp my soul to cheer; Its tones were wont to glad my breast? Where's my friend, who dried each tear, Encourag'd me, and I was blest? Is he gone? my only stay, On whom my brightest hopes were plac'd; Is that friendship fled away, And its heavenly form defac'd? Has some action, undesign'd, Quench'd the spark that once was bright? Or my wild eccentric mind Thrown a veil 'twixt me and light? Friendship! Oh, thou glorious star! Though deep clouded, yet appear; Wander not from me so far, Nor leave me thus oppress'd with care. If thou art for ever fled, I in darkness long must mourn; Pleasure, hope, and comfort dead, Raptures never can return. LINES ON “LONG TOM,” BRAMHAM PARK. O great Long Tom! when thou with foam art crown'd, Thou stretchest care and anguish on the ground; Despair thou buriest deep within the grave;— Thy contents sure would make the coward brave. When gloomy Winter, with his roaring floods, Sends his fierce tempests through the leafless woods; When sleet falls cold and when the night is dark, Fill me Long Tom with ale from Bramham Park. Across the moors I then could cheerful go, Though the cold sleet should change to whirling snow; In sharpest frost I yet should take no harm— In spite of all, Tom's soul would keep me warm. When verdant Spring first dons her virgin shift, And ploughmen hear the skylark in the lift, Send them Long Tom, and they will sing so loud, The larks will stop to listen in the cloud. If from its verge could sip the mellow thrush, How strong his notes upon the topmost bush! Could nature's songsters drink, Long Tom, from thee, They'd cheer the groves with louder harmony. When Summer comes with all her scorching fires, And on his way the thirsty trav'ller tires, Though sweat fall from his locks like drops of rain, Thy soul would cheer him till he walk'd again. In Autumn, when the sportsman hastes away With dogs and gun to spend a cheerful day, He would, when weary, better hit his mark, Had he thy contents brought from Bramham Park. In Winter thou art good to kill the frost; Through circling years thy merit ne'er is lost. If war should ever rage, or Britons fight For their lov'd monarch or their country's right, Their ancient British courage would not fail, Were they but filled with horns of Fox's ale: Then would their bosoms need no more t' inspire Their souls to fight with true heroic fire; Rapid as whirlwinds they would sweep along, Vanquish their foes, however fierce and strong. May British tars for ever have such ale, While e'er a breeze can bend each noble sail; Then will the cannons roar till every wave Curls back and owns itself Britannia's slave: May no disloyal, no dishonest hand, Touch thee, O Tom! while here thou hold'st thy stand. But shouldst thou ever any soul inspire, Just cheer'd, not drunk, but warm'd with honest fire, With grateful bosom may he walk along, And never be too drunk to sing a song! How I could write, wert thou but hither borne, Full as I saw thee on the opening morn, When slow thy contents lessen'd every draught, And those who knew thy power stood by and laugh'd! Then Freedom brought the tear to either eye, And fill'd the humble bard with ecstasy. For generations, firm as Eldwick rocks, Be thou the far-fam'd mighty horn of Fox! WRITTEN AT TONG HALL, ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARRIAGE OF COL. AND MRS TEMPEST, 1829. All the joys of months and years Shall this day remember'd be; While old Sorrow with her cares, Sinks in past eternity. Some have in the tempest sunk, Deep within the ocean's bed; Others, with proud fame made drunk, Shone an hour, the next have fled. But the stars which smiling shone On your horoscope of birth, Circling find you both as one; None can sever you on earth. And as days and years go round, Like two strings in unison, Trembling to affection's sound, True as when it first begun. Parents of a happy race; May your children's children shine, Till each orb has chang'd its place, And the world be all divine. ON THE DEATH OF LADY RICKITTS. Daughter of Col. Tempest of Tong Hall, and wife of Sir Cornwallis Rickitts. Well may the tears of overwhelming woe Down the pale cheeks of num'rous mourners flow! They fall for one whose beauty and whose worth Exceeded all I ever knew on earth. In vain I turn in hopes to hear the strings Responsive wake to her sweet carollings; Then to the marble which in silence stands; Then to the harp that trembled 'neath her hands; Then to her tomb, where all that art can give, Stands in pure love to make her mem'ry live. In vain my spirit strives to track her flight To the far regions of eternal light: The awful bourn of death my friend hath pass'd, And rests beyond dark sorrow's keenest blast; She views no more the changing scenes of earth,— She only liv'd to give a cherub birth, Then flew away to heaven's most blest abode, To rest upon the bosom of her God. THE DEATH OF A YOUNG LADY. Weep, all ye birds, ye bowers! Ye friends, a vigil keep! Send forth your tears, ye flowers! All ye who knew her weep, That she is gone who in your circle smil'd, Far from her husband and her lovely child! The lov'd, the virtuous wife, Has enter'd into rest; Too weak for cares of life— Call'd to her Father's breast; While like a cherub her sweet babe appears, And smiles, unconscious of a father's tears. Her bounty cheer'd the poor, Her hands the needy fed; Now all her pains are o'er, Now that sweet flower is dead, And her glad spirit, borne on seraph's wing, Attunes the Christian's harp where angels sing. THE MUSE. What means it though the poet's cot Be placed in some sequester'd spot, Where oaks, and elms, and beeches grow, Or on the heath, where rushes bow, In vales, where peaceful graze the flocks, Or near the mossy-vestur'd rocks? Romantic scenes can ne'er indite, Nor situations make him write. 'Tis genius must his breast inspire, And light the true, poetic fire. Without it he may read and pore Ancient and modern classics o'er, May walk in ruins late or soon, While through the arches shines the moon, Where sleeps the abbot, monk, or friar; But if he has not Nature's lyre, Nor ancient ruins, nor the woods, The rippling rills, the foaming floods, Embattled fields, nor ancient hall, Romantic scenes, where cat'racts fall, Nor works of other authors' pens, Nor Cumbria's lakes, nor Highland glens, Nor all the scenes which ever graced The paintings of a man of taste, Not all the arts the scribblers use Can make a bard without the Muse. MELPOMENE. The Tragic Muse, in sable mantle dress'd, Majestically great above the rest, With thoughtful look, and tears, and pallid cheek, A comic line is scarcely heard to speak; For higher themes her feeling breast inspire Than lyric measures or the keen satire. The widow's woes,—the virgin's love, she sings, The fate of heroes and the fall of kings; Or palaces in ruins, where the throne Which now is broke, with regal grandeur shone, Where once the beauteous chequer'd marble floor With blood of kings was deeply crimson'd o'er; There like a widow on her husband's tomb, She sits enshrin'd amid the tragic gloom,— Paints ev'ry scene of ancient tyrants' deeds, Then gazes on the ruins wrapp'd in weeds, Till her rich mind replaces ev'ry stone, And seats the murder'd monarch on the throne, Musters his guards—which long in dust have been, Beholds his knights, his heroes, and his queen; Sees the vile traitor, with his murd'ring train, Act all his deeds of darkness o'er again; The courtiers lov'd to-day, and rais'd on high, Frown'd on to-morrow, and their glories die; The dauntless heroes, mark'd with many a scar, Rush on in search of glory to the war, And on their arms the dread suspended fates Of empires, kingdoms, or contending states;— Shrouded in terrors, while around her plays, In ev'ry form, the lightning's vivid blaze. Wading in blood, she marks the hero's fall, While with her crimson pen she minutes all. When to the charge the furious steeds advance, And red with noble blood the glitt'ring lance— The drums, the trumpets, and the clang of arms, The rattling mail, and war's most dread alarms; The banners waving over either host, The day hung doubtful—neither won nor lost; The smoking tow'rs, the city wrapp'd in fire— With loftier themes the Tragic Muse inspire— The noise of battle plumes her tow'ring wings, And gives terrific grandeur while she sings! DIRGE. Blest may my children be, When death shall carry me Into eternity, Ne'er to return; When the fast-falling tear Drops on their father's bier, May some true friend be near, While they all mourn. I now have had my prime, Till there is nought in time But Care's high hill to climb, Weary and faint; Pleasure is fled away, Grief is resolv'd to stay With me by night and day, Terrors to paint. What is bright glory's beam? Why, 'tis an empty dream, Or as the meteor's gleam Crossing the sky. Can riches pleasure bring? No—cares oppress a king: All earthly joys but sting Deep as they fly. Nothing but virtue can Give comfort unto man, Whose life is scarce a span, Wasting away: Honour is but a shade, Like beams on rain display'd, Whose colours quickly fade, Ere ends the day. Thus shall our sorrows end: May we have one great Friend, Through whom we can ascend Far beyond pain; There may my children come, May we all find a home, Far, far beyond the tomb, In bliss to reign! SONG. (WRITTEN FOR A WOUNDED SEAMAN, WHO FOUGHT AT THE BATTLE OF TRAFALGAR.) With my limbs in the deep, And my locks all grown hoary, By cowards insulted, and poor, Few think how I fought For my country and glory, Or know half the hardships I bore. When the wars are all o'er I am thought of no more, The deeds of my valour are lost; Forgot is the day Of Trafalgar's dread bay, When my comrades to Neptune were toss'd. Where the waves stood aghast At the cannon's dread roaring, And the white curling surges retir'd, Brave Britons their broadsides Were rapidly pouring, By Nelson and glory inspir'd! Then the prince of the deeps His trident uprear'd, A moment in wonder he gaz'd; But, struck with great terrors, He soon disappear'd, Our cannon so dreadfully blaz'd! In the midst of the conflict Great Nelson undaunted, Regarded nor balls nor the wave, But order'd the grog When the British tars wanted, And told us what England expects from the brave! THE STORM. When gentle breezes kiss the tide, And waft the vessel o'er the deep, Silent beneath her stately side, The peaceful waters seem to sleep. The sluggish waves just heave along, While swift she cuts the yielding main; The sailors' hearts with hope beat strong To reach their long-left homes again. But gath'ring clouds the sun o'erspread, While he with crimson gilds the west; The storm appears, whose awful head With terror chills each sailor's breast. The frighted billows seem to know The dreadful tempest ere it comes; And, where the whirling hail descends, The frothy sea in madness foams. Nearer and nearer rolls the storm, And wraps in darkness all the sky; While o'er its frowning awful cheek, The dazzling flashes frequent fly. The azure vault is seen no more; But, wrapp'd in deepest gloom of night, The waves return, the thunders roar, And lightnings glare—their only light! Then buried deep beneath the waves, The shatter'd rigging and the shrouds, While, mad with rage, the tempest raves— Her helm is lost among the clouds. No steady course the vessel keeps, By such a dreadful tempest driv'n; But, like a cork upon the deeps, Uplifted by the waves to heav'n. What fervent prayers, in that dread hour! For worlds unknown, they all prepare! And to appease the Almighty Power, Is ev'ry trembling seaman's care. At last she strikes—and floats no more, But sinks a wreck amidst the deep; And, far from England's happy shore, Beneath the waves the sailors sleep. In vain their friends, with bosoms true, Expect with joy their bless'd return; For them no more their friends shall view, But for their loss in anguish mourn. MUSICAL FESTIVAL AT YORK, 1825. THE ORATORIO. Genius of Music! whom, as poets say, Spirits of earth and distant worlds obey! Lend me thine aid, while I attempt, in rhyme, Thy grandest triumph ever heard through time! Fade from my mind, ye country concerts all, Church oratorios, and each private ball; Your puny strains are feeble, weak, and poor As the Jew's harp o'erpower'd by ocean's roar, Compar'd with those which burst in such grand strain As Britain's sons may never hear again! Far was it known, that soon, in Ebor old, The world's great minstrels would a gathering hold; The carriages through dust swift rolled along, Bearing their inmates to the scene of song. The good old city, deck'd in modern grace, Smil'd as they came, and show'd a cheerful face, But look'd with sad and sullen frowns again, If any cloud let fall a shower of rain. Had some great bard been there, he might have seen Hundreds of instruments, encased in green; Or boxes, from all parts of England sent, Wherein were basses, books, and viols pent, All ranks of people throng to the hotel, And scarcely e'er at rest the ostler's bell; And there were trunks which Europe's costumes fill, To grace their owners in the gay quadrille; Servants in every various colour dressed, And on the glitt'ring harness many a crest; Most brilliant equipages throng each street, And, jostling, every kind of carriage meet; Astonished thousands on the Minster gaze, And join to give the noble structure praise: For far beyond description is the pile— The queen of buildings in our native isle,— Whose grandeur and magnificence unite To strike with awe, or fill us with delight! How grand, when England's beauties, fair and young, Assemble there to listen to the song, And youth and hoary-headed age combine To call the scene magnificently fine! Like gardens in full bloom, the ladies' heads, When Zephyr lightly on the roses treads. All flow'rs that deck the vale or crown the hill, Were imitated there with nicest skill; But brighter far, the lovely ladies' eyes Than flow'rs and feathers of the richest dyes. The hour arriv'd—high up above the throng, Stood the Euterpean votaries of song. All was still as death!—a solemn awe Pervaded all men's hearts, through what they saw! Proud titles and distinctions were forgot, Though Albion's noblest sons were on the spot; Gay youths on beauty's charms forbore to gaze, Eager to hear the Eternal Father's praise. The distant organ glorious to behold, King of all instruments, shone bright in gold; Trombones and double basses, placed around, Waiting the signal for majestic sound. And was not Handel's spirit hov'ring near His own grand chorus, when it burst, to hear? O pardon me, ye mighty shades of song, If in imagination I am wrong! The gorgeous splendour now I all forget, And view the shades of great composers met— Croft, Kent, and Purcell, kings of England's choir, Descend to touch the chords with genial fire; Unseen, with Luther, on the air they skim, Nor soar to heav'n till they have heard his hymn. The assembled thousands, wrapp'd in silence all, See the grand host obey their leader's call. Within the instruments lies music's fire, And ev'ry string is tuned within the choir; Six hundred minds, who know each cadence sweet, In one stupendous choral phalanx meet! Silent they stand, until the signal's given; And then the chorus bursts like that of heav'n, Tremendous, and the stoutest heart confounds, And York's proud temple trembles with the sounds. Those who have met the foes on foreign hills Without a fear, now feel the shudd'ring thrills, Which shining cuirassiers could never bring, Nor death, though flying on the battle's wing; But, here, the mighty strains the stoutest melt, And wake an awe they ne'er till now had felt— Strains sweet as are the lark's, which fans the cloud, Mix'd with the trumpet shrill, and sackbut loud. Viols and voices swell the chorus forth, And tones of bass might seem to spring from earth. All parts so full—the mind can wish no more, Except for deeper bass the tempest's roar. The organ swells—what more can earth perform? Its voice is loud as ocean in a storm! The chorus heightens, and the organ's sound Is in the mighty swell of voices drown'd; And “Gloria Patri” in such strains is giv'n, As we no more shall hear on this side heav'n. O for a power that I to all could tell The praise of those who play'd and sung so well! First, Cramer's worth should grace my humble song, And Mori's praise should to my theme belong; Anfossi, Loder, Knyvett I would praise, Though my weak verse their fame no more can raise: And, with the warmest feelings I would write Of music's friend, the well-known genius, White. Had I but time, each name I would put in, Of all who play'd a choral violin— Ashley and Daniels, with their tenor strain, While these my verses last, should here remain; Lindley, and Crouch, and Richardson, and Sharp, Moxon, and Platt, and Bochsa, with his harp; And those of foreign climes, all great in song, Whose names I write not, lest I write them wrong, And fail due praise to genius to impart— 'Tis useless—since they live in ev'ry heart. Phillips and Vaughan, with their fine duet, Made many a lady's cheek with tear-drops wet. The modest Farrar scarcely durst aspire To touch, in graceful strains, sweet “Jubal's lyre.” “Let the bright seraphim,” sweet Stephens sung, As though the notes from angel-voices sprung. His voice great Sapio in such strains could raise, That the charm'd throng could scarce refrain from praise. When Braham sung with all his power and skill, He turned the blood of all the audience chill. The great and noble, young, and old, and fair, Felt the full charm of his sublimest air; Luther's Hymn. While beauteous Caradori stood alone For warbling trills, and melody of tone. In music's art, I have but little skill, Yet oft I find its powers old Care can kill; Though distant, fancy yields me some delight— Methinks I hear the notes all touched aright, With many a singer from a foreign land— The songs, the trios, and the chorus, grand! As when on seas the storm begins to lower, And the dread tempest brings forth all its power Far distant from the calm and tranquil shore, Where we scarce hear the white-topp'd surges roar; But as to land the billows roll along, Louder and louder bursts the awful song, Until the rocky cavern on the beach The mountain waves in dreadful fury reach; Then we poor mortals stand in mute amaze, And on the scene tremendous trembling gaze: So did the finest solos of the choir Send forth their strains, and then again retire; The trio breaks still more distinct and clear, And stronger tones burst forth upon the ear; The swelling semi-chorus louder grows, And then it dies away in graceful close. “He is the King of Glory” next we hear, As though deep thunder and the storm were there. All know their parts—the chorus swells with ease From voices louder than “the sound of seas.” Though far-fam'd Catalina be not here, Braham, to England's bosoms, is as dear; For shall our native poets' words give way To foreign lines, forgot ere ends the day? To foreign pride shall British genius bend, While Albion's isle to Braham is a friend? No—British songs, well touched in ev'ry part, Are those which please the best, and reach the heart: Italian trills may loud applauses reap, But Braham's voice can make the stoutest weep. Where is the tow'ring soul can comprehend Those scenes, which never truly can be penned, Where grandeur and sublimity appear, To charm the eye, or to astound the ear? When were the tones of such an organ drowned, And far o'erpowered each instrumental sound? When were a hundred viols played in vain? Or when was lost the trumpet's piercing strain? The chorus bursts!—it shakes the massive walls— The human voice, like great Niag'ra's falls, O'erpowers the double basses and trombones, The loud bass horns, and serpents' deepest tones. Though Haworth's Parker strain his potent lungs, Yet when at once burst forth three hundred tongues, His thrilling accents can be heard no more Than cry of sea-gull in the ocean's roar. When Yorkshire's choral sons their powers unite, Their tones astonish, and their chords delight; Healthful and strong, their voices may defy In strength, all singers else beneath the sky, Yes, when they sung the song which Israel sung On the sea-shore, to harps their minstrels strung, Lost were the viols' trills, the organ's strain, The chorus bursts—“The Lord shall ever reign!” Grand, as when all the tribes with Moses crossed 'Tween wat'ry walls, when all their foes were lost. “For ever and for ever He shall reign,” Re-echoes through each vaulted arch again! And, as the strains increase, still more and more We seem transported to the distant shore, Where Moses, Israel's bard, composed the song, And ocean's waves the chorus rolled along. “For ever and for ever He shall reign,” In heaven itself, must be the highest strain! THE CONCERT. The beams of day retire o'er western hills; The concert room with gayest fashion fills; The duke, the earl, and many a titled peer, With fairest daughters, press the songs to hear. The choral strength to-night is left behind, While the delicious song enchants the mind. The overture, performed in grandest style, Calls forth applause, and many a beauteous smile. Next come the songs which youthful lovers want, In strains so rich, the coldest they enchant. No instrument, but some great master's hand Brings forth its powers to swell the tuneful band; No fault is there, in music or in words, For nothing added could improve the chords: All is complete—the grand performance such, Nothing there is too little or too much. The world's forgot, and grief and sorrow fly; Anguish and care and melancholy die, When music sweet thus trembles on the strings, And lifts the mind above created things; Soft raptures steal into the feeling breast, Which, for some golden hours, is truly bless'd. The double drums we now distinctly hear, The clarionet, the horn, the hautboy clear; The strong viola, and the serpent's tones; The flutes, the trumpets, and the deep trombones; The violoncello, and the double bass; The viols, sweetest music of the place; And on the air the varying notes are borne, From the soft harp, and from the deep bass horn; Then comes the song, with soft Italian chords, Though sweet, yet few can understand the words. How weak, insipid, formal, and how dead, To Braham's “Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled!” Or “Rule Britannia,” which was heard before In such like strains as England hears no more, When Catalani sung it in such style As made the concert room seem Britain's isle, And all its millions met in one great throng, To hear the grandeur of the noble song. But let the concert be whate'er it will, Greatly performed, with ev'ry master's skill; Though all the parts in richest style we hear, And solemn grandeur, they approach not near In boldness and magnificence, to these Which strike with wonder, or with terror freeze— Great Handel's choruses, which shall be sung While music lasts, or instruments are strung. But human minds variety pursue,— Music itself attracts the most when new; But, when the praise of present music's pass'd, Handel's grand choruses shall ever last. THE BALL. The Ball Room emulates the light of day— All there is mirth, and ev'ry one is gay; Each instrument to finest tones is set, For leader of quadrilles is Collinet. So oddly dressed the young, the old, the fair, All kingdoms seem to have sent dancers there. Kings, emperors, and sultans skip along, Monks, robbers, and banditti swell the throng; The Highland chieftain, in his tartan plaid, And some like warriors of the old crusade. Here, one a Quaker's modest dress assumes, And, there, a Spanish don, with waving plumes; Chinese and Indians, Persians, Turks, and Jews, Peasants and players, in costumes out of use. Hundreds of fancy dresses, rich or poor, Were worn that night, which shall be worn no more, But hang for cent'ries like old coats of mail, And future generations tell the tale, How their great ancestors had danc'd with lords, Or with a duke or countess chang'd blithe words; And many a smile which in the dance was seen, May end in chaise, a ring, and Gretna Green: For such a sly insidious imp is Love, He haunts the ball-room, palace, and the grove; Where peasants dance upon the festive day, He plays his pranks unseen, and soars away. In wildest haunts he melts the savage mind, And wounds in parties of the most refin'd; Spares not the innocent nor beauteous fair, But often sends his strongest arrows there. Many who felt his dart in fragrant bowers, Now rest in peace, their graves bedeck'd with flowers; While those they died for, feel no sorrow deep— Their only tears are those which daisies weep. But oh, may none who figured at this ball, Conceal the wound, fade, and untimely fall; But on this night, should any hearts be joined, May such through life know happiness refined; And when they with fantastic dresses part, Beneath may each one find a virtuous heart, In which, when worldly cares the passions try, May love increase, till death dissolve the tie! How changed old Ebor, since the Roman foe Entered her gates, and laid her glories low! Her warriors slain, or carried captive far, Who knew no dance except the dance of war; Who heard no chords but from the harp or horn, That called them to the chase at early morn; While this, in war-songs, raised their courage high, They rushed to battle, not afraid to die. Where now the ball-room is with grandeur hung, The fall of foes old Ebor's daughters sung; The pheasants' feathers then adorned each head, While they rejoiced that ev'ry foe was fled; Dancing, they hailed the conq'ring warriors home, Beating their swords against the shields of Rome; While some brave chief the captur'd eagles bears, And glitt'ring trophies hang on bloody spears; But now, no foreign foes approach her walls, No Danish ruffians revel in her halls; Rusted the warrior's spear, the sword and lance; Instead of fighting, England's sons can dance, Adorn'd in fancy dresses, show their skill To trip the waltz, or figure the quadrille. Not so at Brussels, when their mirth was broke, And arms! to arms! the piercing trumpet spoke. To arms! to arms! the rattling drums reply— The warriors hear, and know their foes are nigh. They scarce had time to bid the fair adieu, But armed, and swiftly on their chargers flew. The dance forgot, their hearts were on the field, With breasts unarm'd—their valour was their shield; And Europe's shield these warriors proved to be; For on their helms danced fame and victory. But what has York's grand festival to do With arms, with warriors, or with Waterloo, Except to tell the great how bless'd they are— Their joys unbroken by the sounds of war? For then was many a fair, who loved the brave, Yet knew not where to find her warrior's grave. And ladies of the purest virtue there, Who bath'd a brother's wounds with many a tear. Not so at York, when cheerful thousands meet, And hundreds show the graces of their feet; Secure, the lords and ladies wheel around, Still keeping time to music's sweetest sound. Had Solomon been there, he scarce had known Which lady in the richest splendour shone. Old age and wisdom there sat smiling, fain, And wished to try if they could dance again; E'en those who durst not rise, most deeply mourned That such accomplishments they never learned. Now viols' notes in softest cadence die— The dance is o'er, and the musicians dry: For be musician's genius e'er so fine, It always fails, except improved with wine— Wine, which gives poetry and music wings, Inspires with animation all the strings; Makes each wind instrument have better tone, And fills with nobler notes the deep trombone. Now they repose—and what each clime affords Is spread for tradesmen, dandies, and for lords; And every dainty that can please the fair, With choicest wines, is in profusion there. Old York had ransacked every vale and hill, To show her taste, her cook'ry, and her skill. The far-famed band their viols, tune again, And glasses, half drunk off, may there remain; With joy and rapture ev'ry bosom heaves, And fans are waved around like poplar leaves, In all the colours which the rainbow bears, When weeping clouds dissolve in showers of tears. Had I been there, I might have sung of all The glory and the grandeur of the ball; But, fettered fast, far distant forced to stay, My weak, blind fancy only dreams the way. No muse I boast, no great poetic skill, Nor ever knew a waltz or French quadrille; But this I know, in humble country reels Care cannot stick a feather on their heels; Time wings away, while all forget his speed; While pleasure lasts, no other thing they heed. The music bursts again!—the diamond's blaze, And Grandeur's self lead through each varying maze. Ere ancient Greece her pride and glory lost, Such lovely forms could Athens never boast; The Grecian sculptors had in skill advanced, Had they but seen how British ladies danced; And great Raphael should there have present been, To keep through ages the imposing scene, When those who tripped along no more can move In sprightly dance, nor smile the smile of love. SPORTS OF THE FIELD. When oaks are brown and birches bare, And not a bird is singing, The sportsman drives away his care, The speckled woodcocks springing. True joy he in the country knows, His faithful springers ranging Among the hazel's yellow boughs, Or holly, never changing. And when the long-bill'd woodcock springs, Mark!—the sportsman calling,— The blue smoke curls,—its useless wings Through the trees are falling. Full many a man at this would sigh, As sore against religion; But at a feast just let him try Roast woodcock, grouse, or widgeon. ENGLAND'S LAMENT FOR THE LOSS OF HER CONSTITUTION. Let verse, in wild, harmonious numbers flow: My muse descend to pay the debt I owe. Long hast thou taken far thine airy flight, And left me wrapp'd in gloomy shades of night; But when commotions in our nation blaze, When England's sun is robb'd of half its rays, Again these drowsy, torpid passions shake— Rouse every nerve—let all their powers awake. Bring me the magic shell, the native lyre, And warm my bosom with a patriot's fire. For where's the breast that feels not anguish rise? And where the Protestant, but thinks and sighs? The bells that once in cheerful peals could turn, Have changed their notes, and in their changes mourn; The flags, that once waved glorious on each tower, Now, drooping, weep, and shrink from Papal power; Around their staves, now motionless are furl'd, That waved in victory o'er a conquer'd world. Learning and art, come hang your heads and weep, Cambridge be closed—a fast let Oxford keep; Muses be clad in emblems of despair; Ye trees we love, no British roses bear; A foreign serpent's nestling at your roots, To kill your branches while the shamrock shoots; And myriads that have long been open foes To heroes decorated with the rose, Conspire to make our churches tumble down, And place that emblem on the triple crown. Old Ebor's patriot Duke is now no more: The colours which the noble Frederick bore, In death, are dusty: every shatter'd shred Speaks volumes; for the Church's friend is dead. No more of England's glory let us sing, Let Nelson rest, nor touch the vocal string; Let patriots' tears, in torrents flow like rain, For all is lost our fathers fought to gain. Old England mourns; our wives—our children mourn, While patriot hearts with double fury burn To see the far-famed chief of Waterloo (Adorned with laurels taken from the foe), Bring by that arm that oft made tyrants fall, Creatures of Rome to Stephen's ancient hall. In ruined abbeys soon will be fresh souls, Monks in their glory, boasting in their cowls: Where nightly shouting birds have hatching been, Soon will the chisel and the square be seen. Spain will rejoice—in Paris friars dance; Old England's weakness will enliven France. Through all the Continent it will be said: “The ocean's rulers are at last afraid. “Proceed, proceed, the British lion teaze, “He seems to sleep supinely at his ease; “Tug at his ears, and pluck his aged mane, “Close up his eyes, he cannot war again. “Ye peers, new-made, bring shamrock for his food, “Goad him with pikes, and try to rouse his blood: “Bind him with beads, place thistles on his paws; “Then make him bow his head to Papal laws; “And shout on Dover's cliff—let Calais hear— “Another step is gained—another cheer!” Watch him, ye Churchmen! see him move to rise, His nostrils smoke, there's lightning in his eyes; Long has he heard the restless beings moan, In silence watch'd them till they shook his throne. With awful voice he asks, “What wish you more?” And three broad kingdoms tremble at his roar. They answer—“Half the jewels of your crown, “And all the abbeys that are tumbled down; “That abbots, monks, and friars all may be “True English subjects, and as Britons free. “We wish the trident from Britannia's hand, “We wish to place her on some rocky strand; “Take sixteen hundred, eighty years and eight, “With blood of martyrs make her blot the date; “And as with mournful steps she wanders slow, “Drown her deep wailings with ‘Erin go Bragh!’ “And when in deepest anguish she appears, “Throw her a nun's rich veil to wipe her tears.” The lion shook his mane—a rocket flew; Each hill and dale the flaming signal knew. Woolwich awoke, its latent voice to try; Thames trembled with the dread artillery. The five large cannons in the centre placed, With Oriental hieroglyphics graced, Spoke all at once—the deep and sullen roar Awoke the heaviest metal at the Nore: The ships on Medway, and old muddy Thames, Turned into rage, and bellowed forth in flames. The guns on every batt'ry of the land, Enwrapp'd in smoke, vowed England's Church should stand: From hill to hill the thundering echoes ran, Till Ebor heard, and every Highland clan, The Tower's old guns spoke last—the massive walls Felt the fierce shock—though destitute of balls. Then old John Bull, awaking, rises slow: “Why all this thunder? I could wish to know.” A British patriot answer'd with a sigh, “Rome o'er our nation's gained the victory; “The Pope and all the Cardinals can boast, “Their feet again have touch'd Britannia's coast.” “Never,” said John, “while this strong arm of mine “Can carve a sirloin, or my lips taste wine.” Then from his eyes burst forth the manly tear, Sprung from the heart, which showed that grief was there. He oft had heard, at distance, of the storm, But now he views it in its darkest form, Borne on the winds, and in religion wrapp'd; Design its lightnings; every mountain capp'd With clouds of darkness, such as once o'erspread The hearts of cardinals, when martyrs bled. He saw unchanging Eldon leave his place; The people mourned; and grief on every face Of noblest subjects, plainly could be seen; And sorrow reigned where loyalty had been. Let eloquence, supporter of each cause, Lose all its powers, and make a solemn pause; Forget all figures of three thousand years, And every Churchman's heart dissolve to tears, Yet unto Eldon silent honour give, Whose honesty and truth shall ever live. Let monuments of praise to Eldon rise, Whose truth on earth shall glitter in the skies. In every true, unchanging, loyal breast, His bright, unshaken virtue long shall rest. Like the strong watch-tower, when the tempests rage, He firmly stood—the beacon of the age! When seas of eloquence to storms are wrought, Raging in all the sophistry of thought; When princes, dukes, and heroes, changed as wind, Firm as a rock was Eldon's patriot mind: The Liturgy—the Church—the Word of God— The sure foundation where Lord Eldon stood. Nor does he stand alone—for millions yet Retain what memory cannot well forget. Firm is their hope; though clouds may now obscure Old England's glory—yet she rests secure, While patriots like Sadler brave the storm, With fury tossed in every varied form. He scorns the varying scribblers of his day, Unmindful what the editors can say. Secure in rising merit, all their scorn Fades like the mist that hides the light of morn; The more their envy, higher he ascends, His mind unmoved, the glory of his friends. Oh for a thousand more in Stephen's hall, Like him to listen when the people call: Old England would not long in dust be laid, Press'd to the earth, and perishing for trade. No! all would join with mind, with heart, with hand, To send prosperity through all the land. Then would the glory of old England be Again restored to its own dignity, And sixteen hundred, eighty years and eight Would burst again with its own glorious light. With patriot spirit, Churchmen never fear, Unmoved, unchanged, let bishops persevere. Secure for ages have their churches stood, Their doctrines pure, and ratified with blood. There sleep our fathers, there the heroes sleep, And shall we not the Church in safety keep? Ye deists, or ye atheists, tell me where Does honesty or sterling worth appear, If not in those who at the church attend, Whose prayers all other prayers on earth transcend. Take every volume, every book away, The flow'ry verses lasting scarce a day, Or bring all books creation could contain, With all the records of the martyrs slain— Mahomet's Alkoran—or creeds of popes— Can these support the fearful Christian's hopes? All fail—ye know it—Latin prayers when read, Not understood, nor reach the heart, nor head. Take every ship that ever fought in war— Take England's honours—garter—crown—and star— Take the broad pennants—let them all be furl'd, And to some dark abyss be quickly hurl'd— Take all—then ask what made old Albion stand When war and blood stained every popish land? Why, nothing ever made us rest secure But true religion and the Church kept pure. Take from our favoured land the vital part, She falls, like Nelson, wounded in the heart. Oft have we heard the hills, the valleys ring With England's anthem of “God save the King;” But now the children have forgot the song, Or weakly sounds the chorus from each tongue. Oh! what a change:—and this the total cause, For England cannot bend to popish laws. The hated deed we know was quickly done, That darkly clouded England's glorious sun, The clouds shall yet disperse, the shadows flee, The Constitution gain the victory! Shall every lord, shall every earl turn fool? These noble Britons of the ancient school: Shall sterling worth, the glory of our land, Plant a false banner on the sea-beat strand? No, never! woman with her richest smiles, Who sometimes kings, and often lords, beguiles, Shall fail to bring the Vatican's rich crown To glitter on our great archbishop's throne. Popes never more, while eagles rise with wings, Shall have their stirrups held by British kings. O Ireland! every blessing has been given That England e'er could grant on this side heaven, And now thou wouldst with England's goodness play, Cut the strong cable, and then launch away. Thy bonds and ties to England thou wouldst break, Tow thyself off, and leave the nation weak: That must not be:—thou canst not have thy will; In every storm our chiefs are Britons still. Long have they borne thy insults till they tire, Patience has quenched their thunders and their fire. When these no more can bear, ye all will fly; An arch of flame will quiver on the sky. When vengeance rouses from the British shore, Liffey shall tremble with the dismal roar: To mountains, rocks, and caves, ye all shall flee, Wrapp'd in the gloom of your own infamy. If ever Britons loved the Brunswick line, If Eldon's honesty did ever shine, If ever war brought terrors on our shore, If on the coasts the waves did ever roar, Now is the time for faithful priests to stand, The strength—the bulwark—of a sinking land. O'er that loved monarch let your sighs be heard, And bless the memory of King George the Third, Who loved not monarchy, but who could part With throne and crown, ere he could yield his heart To break the oath, the seal, that placed the crown Upon that head, which care and grief bore down. See old John Bull with all his sons around, His honest brow with silv'ry honours crowned. Upon the ceiling is the church portrayed, Where his dear partner low in dust is laid: The portrait of the priest he loved, hung there, His hand contains the Book of Common Prayer; And on the ceiling all exposed to view, The scene from Milton's paradise perdu; Where monks' and friars' robes are toss'd on high “Through the wild limbo of light vanity.” He thinks of all the struggles that have been; In various wars, what changes he has seen. He sighs at the condition of the realm, Without a chief with pow'r to guide the helm. Let all the papers, journals of the day, Use all their eloquence to lead astray The reading multitude: 'tis all but wind, And cannot move the honest patriot's mind. The various sects that wish to have the pow'r, Whose plans have sprung and perish'd in an hour, And never take old Oxford's glory down: The Church has friends in every British town: The poor—the rich—will join the Church to save, And guard the relics of a father's grave. No inquisition ever shall be here; Nor heretics in prisons drop a tear; Nor popish darkness ever quench the light That tells the British subject what is right. Then cease to murmur—Britons rest secure, For ages yet shall England's Church endure; Infallibility she does not boast, Believing not in relics—saints—nor host, What these have gained is but the weakest part, For “Church and State” fill every loyal heart. But is all settled?—do they wish no more? And is the great, the mighty struggle o'er? No!—what they've gained, with patience must be tried; Till then, beware ye grant them aught beside; For if your boon will not their envy kill, There is no peace—nor ever! ever will!! OWEN'S NEW MORAL WORLD. To combat error in each varied form, Which comes o'er England as a sweeping storm, Engages now the minds, the time, the breath, Of those that should be comforters in death. Of all the various volumes in the land— In every language—by whomever plann'd— However great or wise the author be— However penn'd—Great Book! there's none like thee. There the sublime, with majesty and awe, Pours forth the dreadful thunders of the law; And there the songs the mighty prophets sung, The masterpiece of either mind or tongue, Beyond the reach of any other pen, As furthest stars are lost to human ken. And are there men in Christian England born, That laugh the authors of that book to scorn; Dispute its origin, and vainly say 'Tis preach'd by priests for lucre and for pay? Reject its history of Adam's fall? Deny His Godhead who redeem'd us all? Is Homer like the Bible; or that thing Call'd Alkoran, and brought on pigeon's wing, Prideaux's Life of Mahomet. For which Mohammedans may fret and fight, Groping their way in atheistic night? The ten commandments you may cast away, And tell the Christian 'tis in vain to pray; Then rear the mosque, and Mahomet believe— Confucius worship, and yourselves deceive; Adore the stars, or yet the larger lights, And for the Scriptures read th' “Arabian Nights;” State—if you dare—that Christ did ne'er ascend To His high throne—the dying Christian's friend; In Owen, say—is all our faith and hope, He is our teacher, patriarch, and pope! Say that he form'd us, gave us breath and life— Despises marriage and the name of wife; Say from the azure he the comets hurl'd— So great, he nearly can create a world; Then scoff at priests, and o'er professors boast, Until pale death demands the trembling ghost. Ah! then's the time the Socialist to try; Without a Christian's hope, where can he fly? Your pity for our priests is but your scorn, The church lands you would take to grow your corn; Let Canterbury's wealth to you be giv'n, The Owenites might try their fancied heav'n. Could Durham's riches, or old Ebor's fee, Be giv'n to Chartist demagogues and ye; Still not content, old Chester you would want, And great Llandaff's estate, to sow and plant. The sacred edifices you would let fall, Or make each choir a Scientific Hall, Ye then would ape the deeds of deist France, Make mirth in churches—in cathedrals dance; Then would some sophist leader lift his voice, And, as he broke the cross, would shout—“Rejoice;” While ancient statues that have stood for years, Would almost blush, and marble melt to tears. But had you all the wealth and power you want— Were England yours, to sow, to reap, to plant— In your new system, would no writs be sent? Must Owenites live free from tax and rent? Would every debt be cancell'd in one day, By those wise chiefs who sing, but never pray? If so, 'twould not be heav'n—the human mind Would yet be craving, fretful, and unkind; Then would be contests for the richest town, Who must be chiefs, and who must wear the crown; All social order, and all rule be lost, And England's greatness into ruin toss'd. This baseless system never can succeed, Unless all nations turn to Owen's creed; For should no troops be kept to guard the strand, No fleets, how soon the enemy would land; The foreign foe would ransack hill and vale, Famine and death would then our ports assail, England, brave England, would be downwards hurl'd, And scorn'd would be the mistress of the world. From days of Adam to the present hour, Mankind has ever been averse to pow'r; The wise, the prudent, ever envied were, For demagogues in every age appear. Long centuries since, the golden calf was made, And Moses' priesthood might be called a trade: Not pleas'd with Joshua in everything, They slighted judges, and desir'd a king; A king was granted, but he reign'd not long Ere king and all his government was wrong. From man's beginning to the present hour, Has human nature always envied pow'r; In every nation of this little world, What kings, what queens, have to the dust been hurl'd, Till reason teaches, and great learning's shown, The serpent nestles nearly in the crown; And should the Moral World be fairly tried, So long as mortal bosoms harbour pride, Thousands to mar the plan would there conspire, And in this Moral World would each aspire; To mount ambition's ladder men would try; The top gain'd, others at the bottom lie. So 'tis with all of every creed and state, For wealth and honour, hundreds rush to fate; But those that take a premium on heav'n, Which on this earth was never, never giv'n, To purchase land, to lay it out in farms, To make new nature, with ten thousand charms, To lead their dupes into the silken snares, Gain fifty pounds; to join the common shares Is beauteous, when in imagination seen, But see the chasm that years must roll between. Vain as the Southern Bubble it will be— As soon expect a bridge across the sea. The mind of man, the learned sophists say, Is like the cotton, which unstain'd to-day, To-morrow circumstances twist it round, And in another shape the bulk is found. Perhaps it runs in each disciple's head, The spinning of New Lanark, and the thread Which broke in forming, spun with so much haste, That its material snapp'd, and went to waste. But let us see the process further yet, The warp and woof, the finest we can get, Is formed in calico; a conscience made, And dyed, in colours just to suit its trade. If 'tis a lawyer's, it must dark appear; If for a nun, unspotted, white, and clear; Or should it deck the Turkish heart or head, A turban it must form, of white and red. As unstain'd snow upon the frosty morn, Glitt'ring with gems, when by a princess worn; But coarsest waste, its colours dim and grave, Is that which suits the bosom of the slave. Thus Socialists the various creeds would make To suit all states, and every colour take; Stain it with dyes of every varied hue; Print it with doctrines, either false or true; Stretch it from north to south, from east to west, Then call it conscience—place it in the breast, Say the human mind is like cotton dyed, And show that atheist doctrine is their pride; So spiders weave the net to catch the fly— Entangled once, they flutter, tire, and die; When 'tis too late they feel the fatal snare, And e'en in death to others cry—“Beware!” Go on, great Brindley, and expose their wiles, Attack their system, gain eternal smiles; Join with the phalanx of the Christian band, To drive this specious doctrine from the land. Why all their eloquence, their shallow praise? 'Tis but to set the nation in a blaze. Among the aged, first O'Connor tries, Then Owen makes our youth his sacrifice. The demagogues have talked till they are hoarse, And led their dupes to arms and bloody force. With milder tones, but yet as base and low As depths of schism and discontent can go, These say that paradise on earth would be, Were their New World but spread from sea to sea; Then palaces would rise on every hand, The poor be rich, and rulers of the land: The Gospel ministers, their silks might weave; The bishops of the state, their mitres leave; All things in common, then the rich, the brave, Might stoop to elevate the vagrant slave; The gen'rous lord, that bounteous gives his store, Must have his carriage and his halls no more; The first-born sons must be no longer heirs, And equal all in such a creed as theirs; The links of social ties, for ages join'd, Must be drawn out to suit an Owen's mind; The marriage rite be called no more divine, Nor He that chang'd the water into wine. What dire confusion in the land would be, Should Owen's doctrine make the married free; If stronger ties than caprice did not bind The evil passions of the human mind, Faults would be found with every virtuous wife, Her dowry vanish'd in a six months' strife; What innocence would on the wilds be thrown, That to the Moral World would ne'er be known; No guard nor guide, no home, no help or stay, When palling passions cast the wife away. The thought's prepost'rous, that the good, the fair, Should not through life an equal burden share; With every joy be more encircled round, With every sorrow yet more closely bound, With every smile of daughter or of son Consider nuptial life but just begun. And are there those would marriage set at nought, And let creation's fairest gems be bought? The bird of paradise may be encag'd, But should the lark the keeper's mind engage, The beauteous bird, well fed and blessed to-day, To-morrow's sold, or left to birds of prey: So would it be with woman good and fair; Her fortune spent, then lost her partner's care; Hopeless, in penury, the wife be left, Of ev'ry hope, of ev'ry stay, bereft; Then sorrow rests upon the mother's cheeks, While the base Owenite a richer seeks. No legal tie, and all the chain is broke, The marriage rite is priestism, or a joke. But is our being to this world confin'd? Then farewell all the wisest of mankind, All men are equal, both the wise, the good, And Hindoo priests, with deities of wood; The great apostles, and the prophets slain, Had equal hope with Volney or Tom Paine. Man's a machine, and as a puppet mov'd, Helvetius, Godwin, Owen, say 'tis prov'd. If some may ask, why all this great parade? 'Twould seem to say that Christians are afraid; Else, why should champions of the greatest power Combat the doctrines fleeting as an hour; But recollect, the mosquito can bite, And adders sting, though little is their might; A fly, the noblest steed can much annoy; The asp, with death can blast a parent's joy; And should their doctrine now corrupt the young, The deadly poison lurks beneath the tongue. And must our Bible blaze at their command? Will kings let fall their sceptres from their hand? Will masters their authority forego, And let their servants teach them what to do? Buchanan of his eloquence may boast, As second leader of the impious host, That would the Sacred Scriptures supersede, And pour contempt on every Christian's creed; Dash down the font, and say that baptism's vain; Make marriage void—then deluge hill and plain With doctrines base as infidels can bring, To ruin virgins, or dethrone a king. Let Christian ministers of every creed Conjointly rise, and then will they succeed; But, when divided, vain is all their power, The fold is weak, and sophists can devour. Let party spirit now be laid aside, Unite in one, without sectarian pride. O England! where are all thy mighty fled? Where are thy patriarchs—thy illustrious dead: Thy Latimers and Cranmers, where are they? Such noble minds are surely passed away, Who in the flames firm and exulting stood, And seal'd the Scriptures with a martyr's blood! Where is the Socialist so bold, so brave, That for his creed would triumph o'er the grave? If Owen be your guide, with him go on Till life's last quiv'ring, trembling taper's done. Then ask his aid, when struggling hard for breath, What consolation he can give in death; Laugh then at ministers, and wish to stay— That is the time when mortals learn to pray. When eloquent and just, great, awful Death Comes as Heaven's sheriff to demand our breath; He then persuades, whom none could yet advise; Serves all alike, the foolish and the wise. The honour'd great, for whom the flatterers shout, Thou hast despised, and from the world shut out; Thou draw'st together all the pomp, the pride, Cruelty, ambition, and all else beside; The poor, the rich, the feeble, and the strong; The sons of sorrow, and the sons of song; Lay'st them in dust, and shroud'st them with thy pall, And two short words, “Hic jacet,” cover all. But without Christ, where would the soul be cast? How bear the power of Heav'n's o'erwhelming blast? For conscience is the fuel of the fires And bears the vengeance, when the dust expires. At such a scene—when every hope is lost, And the eternal part to ruin tost— Could yon bright sun to double darkness turn— The ocean, in a robe of sackcloth mourn— Were nature all to howl, lament, and sigh, And blackness shroud the brilliant orbs on high— She could not heave a sigh, too vast, too deep, O'er one that's lost, and must for ever weep. ON THE DEATH OF THOMAS COOPER, ESQ., SURGEON, BINGLEY. How bootless are our tears, though ev'ry drop Springs from the fountain of a sorrowing heart! No sorrow death's relentless hand can stop, Or, for a moment, turn aside his dart. Affection's ties, without remorse, he breaks: Lo! 'neath his feet, our friend, dear Cooper, lies! He moves not, when a tender sister speaks, Nor sees a father's hopeless agonies. Death! thou hast slain the noblest of thy foes— One who oft rescued victims mark'd by thee— One who could sympathise in others' woes, And forms of beauty from thy grasp set free. Friend of our soul! in him we could confide In weal or woe—but now our friend is gone! We ask by whom his place can be supplied; And hopeless sorrow, weeping, answers—none! Nor midnight hour, nor wildest winds of heaven; Nor pelting showers of rain, or snow, or hail; Nor perilous paths through forests, tempest-riven; Nor raging hurricanes could aught avail His visits to the afflicted to restrain: Through these he rode, regardless of his health, The blessed harbinger of ease to pain, Alike to homes of poverty or wealth. Hundreds, on sickbeds, oft have yearn'd to hear His welcome step, and bless'd him when he came! Hope dawn'd when their Samaritan stood near, With soothing balsams for the suffering frame. But 'tis the last, the last sad solemn day, When by his mourning friends, his dear remains To their last home, are slowly borne away, And the deep death-knoll peals in dirge-like strains. Alas! he who has oft renew'd the springs Of life in bosoms sickness had oppress'd, The comforter, with healing on his wings— Has pass'd from earth to his eternal rest. But he has left a blessed name, That long shall live in many a grateful heart: His good deeds are his monumental fame, Which will survive all boasted works of art. We feel, what words in full can ne'er explain, A weight of woe at loss of one so lov'd; But hope our loss is his eternal gain, In the bright land to which he is remov'd. The grave receives his dust, which there shall lie, Till in the clouds appear the great white throne; And the last trumpet pealing from the sky, Bid “mortal immortality put on.” Oh! shall no meet memento of our love Mark the dear spot where his remains repose? Yes, we will plant his honour'd dust above, The early snow-drop, and the fragrant rose; And there, when to God's house we come to pray, On holy Sabbaths, in the circling years, We will at early morn our visits pay, And bathe the flowers with true affection's tears. ON A YOUNG LADY, DROWNED IN THE STRID. The lovely group adorn'd with ev'ry grace, With health and pleasure beaming in each face, Upon the river's brink in rapture stood, And saw their charms reflected in the flood, With trees of ev'ry size and varied hue, And grey rocks blent with heaven's azure blue: Whilst mellow blackbirds and the tuneful thrush Sang dulcet strains on ev'ry blossom'd bush; There happy hearts throbb'd fast with mirth and glee, Enjoy'd the scene and Nature's harmony. But hark! what piercing, what terrific cries; Shriek answers shriek, affrighted echo flies, Tells every rock, and all the streams that flow From all the hills and through the vale below, “Eliza's lost in Strid's dark rocky deeps,” The mountains mourn, and every valley weeps. Despairing, to the Strid the virgins go, And every bird chants plaintive notes of woe; Courageous Dean true heroism display'd, And struggled hard to save the drowning maid, Plung'd headlong 'neath the rocks, and div'd away To rob the roaring torrent of its prey; He caught her strings The strings of her bonnet which broke and she sank. with mingled hope and fear, They quickly broke—he saw her disappear— Again urg'd on the sinking maid to find, He deeper plung'd and left all light behind, Explor'd the basin to its deepest bed, The thund'ring waters rolling o'er his head, He search'd the eddying gulf in vain to find The lovely maid, till faint and almost blind, At last exhausted he could bear no more, Nor scarce had strength to reach the rocky shore; Grasp'd by cold death upon his watery bed, Insensible to pain, Eliza's life had fled. Hoarse roar the surges o'er the lady's grave, The foam glides swiftly on the circling wave, A thousand bubbles burst amidst the strife, As floating emblems of man's fleeting life; In richest colours these a moment play, Then mingling with the current, pass away; How like the world! when greatest joys appear, Death, or deep anguish, oft are lurking near. Ye angry surges and ye foaming deeps, Where watchful death his awful station keeps; How could ye dance, and sport with form so fair; Exult o'er beauty sinking in despair, Take her from friends without a last adieu, And there expose her lifeless form to view? And did they weep? Ah no! their cheeks were dry, Grief froze the tears before they reach'd the eye; The modest blushes from each face depart; And, join'd with anguish, centre in the heart. Insatiate deep! who like the stormy main No pity know'st for youth and beauty slain; Clad in white foam with death thou could'st rejoice, Laughing at sorrow with thy hideous voice, Dancing to thine own music, deep and hoarse, Thy whirlpools sporting with the lifeless corpse: When Romili The boy of Egremont, son of Cecelia de Romille, sole heir and last of the family. fell, and in thy current slept, His mother mute with woe, all Craven wept; Tears from the willows dropt into the flood, And weeping nymphs near thy dark palace stood. 'Twas thus when lov'd, when fair Eliza fell, The valley echoed with the alarming bell, The vale of Bolton all suffus'd with tears, In sable robe and mourning weeds appears; In solemn strains each feather'd warbler sings, The soaring skylark pensive drops his wings; The varied trees, the shrubs of Wharfdale weep; The high cascades with sorrow murmur deep, Each pensive muse mourns o'er Eliza's tomb, And Strid's dark shades are wrapt in deeper gloom: The ravens croak, and on the guilty stream Each shadowing light now sheds a lurid gleam. The trembling peasant thinks he sees her shade, Expecting every step to meet the maid; But, vain his fears; her soul is far away, And her fair form now rests in kindred clay. THE POET'S SICKBED. How little looks the world to him in pain, Whose whole estate is sorrow's darkest train, With mind in ruins and his soul o'erthrown, When friends retire as though they were not known. How deep the anguish when his genius wastes, As early, trembling, to the grave he hastes; With quiv'ring pulse—an appetite destroy'd— All pleasure fled which once he most enjoy'd. The stars no pleasure give, no orb on high Inspires his soul with highest ecstasy; The vast unfathom'd sea he views no more, The heavens' beauty in his bosom's o'er. With landscapes, rocks, and hills, he so much lov'd, His trembling anxious bosom is not mov'd; His unsubstantial friends, who once were sweet, The lonely bard now tread beneath their feet. THE BIBLE. Of all the various volumes in the land— In ev'ry language—by whomever plann'd— However great or wise the author be— However penn'd—Great Book! there's none like thee. There the sublime, with majesty and awe, Pours forth the dreadful thunders of the law; And there the songs the mighty prophets sung, The masterpieces of both mind and tongue, Transcend the reach of any other pen, As farthest stars are lost to human ken. A PRAYER. O Thou, whose name, with trembling, angels use— A name no human language can express! Be Thou my light, my glory, and my muse, And stoop the meanest worm on earth to bless. Thron'd in the heaven of heavens, eternal Sire! I less than nothing in Thy sight appear; Thine is this spark of immaterial fire, That warms my breast, and acts the umpire there. To Thee, great Source of being and of light, May I this heart in adoration raise! Bow down before Thy majesty and might, And with deep rev'rence give Thee worthy praise! Where I have err'd, as I too oft have done, May deep repentance for my errors flow! While with sincerity I mourn alone, Far from the crowd of ostentatious show. In yon vast region of unbounded space, Thine arm, unseen, sustains each flaming ball; And shall proud mortals circumscribe Thy grace, As insufficient for the wants of all? What is this earth, with all it doth contain, Its lofty mountains and unfathom'd sea?— The sea a drop, the earth itself a grain, Weigh'd in the balance with immensity. Such is Thy mercy's sea, without a shore, That ev'ry soul in ev'ry human breast Needs but to ask (Thou dost require no more), To give that mercy, and to make it bless'd. Mine be that boon when life's short day shall end, And to some unknown world my soul shall soar! Be Thou my God, my Father, and my Friend,— Oh grant me this, and I can ask no more! TO THE CRITICS. Sat down by my wee rusted lyre, And musing which way to get through, Ye quenchers of poets' best fire, How oft have I trembled at you! The vulture may seize the young lamb, The raven may torture the dove, And critics may tell what I am, But oh, let your censures be love! Ye weighers of man's little wit, Which comes in a book to your eye, Like spiders on cobwebs you sit, To mangle and murder a fly. Write your praise or dispraise for the great, And rail on the muse of a lord, Shoot at those who are laughing at fate, And strike with your fame-killing sword. But come to my cottage, and view What feathers I have for my wings; And then you will own there are few So lowly durst strike at the strings. I gaze on my children asleep, Assur'd that their lot is but hard; Yes, while I write verses I weep To think their best friend is the bard.</field>
