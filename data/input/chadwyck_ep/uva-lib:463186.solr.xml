Of Fraunce and other/I myght lykewyse report To theyr great honour/as of theym doth appere But to Englande/if I shall resort Ryght mysty storyes/doughtfull and vndere Of names of tymes/and of the duraunt yere That kynges or prynces/ruled that famousyle Almoste vncertayne/howe I shuld guyde my style. And for of cunnynge/I am full destytute To brynge to frame/so great a mysterye I nyll presume/without other refute To ioyne suche a werke/or it to rectyfye To me it semyth/so ferre sette a wrye. In tyme of yeres/to other discordaunt That to my dull wytte/it is nat atteynaunt. To brynge in ordre/a thynge of suche weyght And cause it to agre/with other olde storyes But it to remytte/to theym that been sleyght And sharpe in lecture/and haue kepte theyr studyes And sought the bookes/of many olde hystoryes And haue in Cronycles full experyence To frame suche a werke/by theyr great prudence. And I lyke the prentyse/that hewyth the rowth stone And bryngeth it to square/with harde strokes and many That the mayster after/may it ouer gone And prynte therin/his fygures and his story And so to werke it/after his propornary That it may appere/to all that shall it se A thynge right parfyth/and well in eche degre. So haue I nowe/sette out this rude werke As rough as the stone/nat c?men to the square That the lerned/and the studyed clerke May it ouer polysshe/and clene do it pare Flowrysshe it with Eloquence/wherof it is bare And frame it in ordre/that yet is out of ioynt That it with olde Auctours/may gree in euery poynt. Besechynge hym/that wyll so take the payne Or any other/that lyste on this loke Where any Errour/in this by hym is sayne It to correct/and mende this rude boke For by hym/that neuer yet/any ordre toke Or gre of Scole/or sought for great cunnynge This werke is gaderyd/with small vnderstandynge. Nat for any pompe/or yet for great mede This werke I haue taken/on hande to compyle But of cause oonly/for that I wolde sprede The famous honour/of this Fertyle Ile That hath contynued/by many a longe while In excellent honour/with many a royall guyde Of whom the dedys/haue spronge to the worlde wyde. But of those dedys/me lyste nat here to shewe For in the Sequele/they shall well appere And in short processe/and in as wordes fewe As I goodly may/I shall lyke in fere The Sturyes of Englande/and Fraunce so dere That to the reder/it may well be sayne What kynges togyder/ruled these landes twayne. And in the pryncipyll/of reygne of euery kynge As well of one/and other more and lesse What yere of the worlde/he toke begynnynge To guyde his Realme/and ferther besynesse I wyll eke take/to shewe and expresse What terme of yeres/euery prynce dyde reygne And in what honour/he dyd his tyme maynteyne. The tyme also/howe longe the Brytons ruled And howe by Saxons/they were lastly put oute Than of Danes/whiche bothe landes defoyled By theyr outrage/and of theyr fury stoute Of whom bothe nacions/stode longe in great doute Tyll Fraunce with theym/allyed by maryage And Englande lastly/voyded that lynage. Nota.Than howe the Normannes/by Wyllyam Conquerour Entryd this lande/and helde the Sygnory A certayne of tyme/tyll the hygh gouernour Restored the blode/of Saxons Enderly And of the Scottes/that neuer coude apply To kepe theyr Allegeaunce/but many a tyme rebelled And to be true/were full often Compelled. The fatall warre/that hath dured so longe Twene Fraunce and Englande/to both theyr damage And of the peas/that hath ben vnderfonge Bothe by great othes/and Eke by maryage Of Walys Geryshnesse/and of theyr lyght dotage Howe they were scourged/for their vnstedfastnesse With dyuers other/whiche I shall after expresse. And for that London/that Auncient Cytie Hath euer parseueryd/in vertuous noblesse To the great honour/as may consiryd be Of all this lande/in welth and great largesse Therfore I thynke/somwhat to expresse Of their good ordre/and Ciuyle polycy That they so longe/haue ruled their Cytie by. And of their rulers/as they are yerely chosyn To rule the C?monte/by their discrecion I shall you shewe/and to you disclosyn The names of Mayres and Shyriffes of that towne And all suche actis/as by Reuoluciowne In their dayes fyll/so that there shall appere The prynces Actes/whiche chaunged yere by yere. Of Fraunce also/the Cronycle shall ensewe In his dewe ordre/so that ye may knowe Whan they began theyr prynces to renewe And from the seruage/whan they were kept lowe Of the Romaynes/whom they dyd ouerthrowe And of theyr names/that they whylom dyd chaunge Of theyr firste Baptym/and of theyr maners straunge. Thus in this boke/may you here or se Of bothe landes/the Cronycles entiere With other matiers/whiche Regystred be Of olde wryters/suche as wrote full clere Actes of Prynces/done both ferre and nere And theym engrosed/with great dylygence Wherby to their folowers/myght growe experyence.
