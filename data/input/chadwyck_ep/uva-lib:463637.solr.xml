      <field name="fulltext">To his ever Honoured friend Mr P. I. on his Amorea. Should I commend thy Poems, that would be A needless complement, for all do see: That do but read thy works, thou hast out-gone, More then I'me able speak, or think upon? Yet this I dare afirme what thou hast writ Thou hast not borrowed from anothers wit: Thy muse doth scorn that any one should say I've read those verses once before to day, No thus I'le pubblish (with a be it known To all the world) the Poems are thy own Thy Amorea hath no other plumes To set her out, no Paint, nor yet perfumes, No braded hair, no Peacook-couller gown? She's in a moddest dress, and tis her own In which i'le leave her to the pubblick vew Of the Ingenious Readers: friend Adus. Jo. Frankelin To my dear friend Mr. P. J. on his Amorea. Thou dost not writ of Armies, or of Fights, Of Monsters, Giants, nor of armed Knights, Nor how great Ladies did in Castles lie, By strange adventures, gaining libertie, No dreadfull Battells thou discrib'st for fear, It should be harsh to any Ladies eare, Nor dost thou sing of Travells, that may bring Truth in suspition: thou dost not sing Of strange prodigious Monsters, whose birth, Without production sprung from the earth, No, those poor Rabbles thou dost scorn too touch' Thy fancie flyeth to a higher pitch. Thy passion being fired from above, Thou sing'st that noble, noble passion Love. A. Mathews. To his Ingenious Friend Mr. P. J. on his Poems of the King's Return. VVelcome sweet soul into the Company Of noble Poets, (welcome again say I) Where hast thou been? tell us, how conld thy worth Lie hid so long, why did it not break forth? Where wert thou when as half the world did sing The glorious welcomes of our Sacred King, Did Amorea so much hold thy mind In due observance? that thou could'st not find One hour to express thy joyes with us: No 'twas not so, the reason sure was thus. Thou went's into Arabia, to bring A Quill from off the Widow-Phenix's wing, With which thou'st written, that thy Loyalty Is so apparent, as the world may see, If they but read thy Poems, thou'st out gone, Not only half, but most, that writ upon Our Kings Return; thy enemies do think Thou writ'st in gold, and not with vulgar Ink. Jo. Dancie. To his esteemed friend Mr. P. J. On his Poems. Aide me Ben Jonsons Ghost, come Cleavelands Spirit Might I old Quarles his smoothness but inherit, Or were I metamorphis'd for a while Into some Lofty Poet, my poor stile: Must needes come very short of thine, yet I, Will pay my tribute to thy Poetrie, Which if you do except, although a mite, I'me sure tis full of love? though it want waight T. M. To his Dear Brother, on his Amorea. Is't true, I have a Poet-Brother, who Hath seen Mouut Hellicon at twenty two, Been bred up with the Muses, and hath quase Of the Pierian Fount a liberal draught, In Agganippe Well hath dip'd his Quill, And fetch'd his paper from Parnassus hill; 'Tis true, I have; and had he been another, (But 'Ile forbear because he is my Brother) I'de speak his praiss, for thus much I do know, His Works will shew it, more then I can do. Jo. Jenkin. To my dear friend on his Amorea How many hours, nay daies, I may say years How many sighs, and vows, bow many tears Hast thou paid to the memorie of one That (like the Phenix) vows to live alone. Could I perswed thee, but i'me come to late I will not make thee more unfortunate, Suppose (Resuming of a second life) That Amorea were to be thy wife Thats all could make thee blest, yet she must die And now she lives to perpetuity R. M. To his Dear and ever honoured freind Mr. P. J. on his Poems. I shall not flatter. I'me no Parasite, I'le not deminish, nor yet add a mite Vnto thy prayse; for what need Gold to be New gilded or'e that's vain curiosity, If wit be judge then thou art sure of prayse, And Dunces must not read such lines as these, For if they should, they'l finde an Epigram Will tell them to their face, thou art the man: I could speak much in prayse, but to what end When all that Read thee do it, no dear friend, Ile wish thee happiness, but this i'le prove, Thy book will make the Dullest Soul to love. G. M. To his dear and ever Honoured friend Mr. P. J. On his Poems. Should I write any thing in praise of thee That were a nedless thing, ile rather bee One of the number: that do thee admire And then I have all that I do desire: For two be bound up with your book I know (Though you admit) my verse will useless shew. J. C. To my dear friend on his Amorea. VVhat in the wars and yet a Poet, then Tell me the difference 'twixt the sword, and pen Canst thou with one hand grasp the tempred steel, And in the other holde thy loved quill, Be angry in a moment and yet prove Thy anger onely doth proceed from love: This day be bravely mounted in the street, To morrow prostrate at thy Ladies feet? Write Sonnets in the morning; and ere night Be deep ingaged in some cruell fight, Just now a going to a Nuptiall And presently cal'd to the Funeral Of some new Slaughtered friend, how can this be Why thus, the question's plain enough, for we. (That read thy Poems needs) must do thee right For thou canst fight, and love, and love, and fight. R. H. To his ever friend Mr P. J. On his Poems. I am as full of love as those that do Write better Verses in the praise of yon (And if it may not be disparagment To those have writ thy praise) tis my intent: To write a line or two, that all may know it Reading thy Poems, I am half a Poet W. A. To Mr P. J. on his Amorea. How should I do my mind for to rehearse I can write love enough but not in verse Yet my dear friend do not refuse this mite For I declare unto the world I write: Not to win praise, for then I'me sure I shall Have very little, for you have gotten all, I am contented, it doth joy my heart When as I go abroad, in every part; For to hear this, and th' other Ladie say Have you not Amorea read to day. One takes occation for to praise this thing? Another will take up her Lute and Sing. One of thy Sonets; this will drop a tear, For thy mifortune; some I've heard to swear Thy Pastroll Poems best, some think it Dutie To praise that Poem thou hast writ on Beautie Should I give my opinion? truly I Compare thy book unto a Lottery Her'es Gold enough presented to our Eies; Draw where we will, we cannot miss a prize. W. C. TO AMOREA; The DEDICATION. To the fairest and divine, Next unto the Sacred Nine, To the Queen of love and beauty, I do offer up my duty; To the sweetest disposition, That e're Lover did petition, To the best and happ'est fortune, Ever man did yet importune, To the Lady of all hearts, That pretend to noble parts; To the altar of her eyes, I my self doe sacrifice; To her ever winning glances, Here I doe present my fancies; And to her all commanding look, I doe dedicate my book. To the Muses. Muses I do invoke you to inspire, And grant to me your great and holy aid, That in my fancies so it may be said, I favour win, favour'd by your Atire. Yet how, or what I shall insist upon, Or on what subject I should first begin, Against the Muses, sure it is a sin For me to speak, or think of Hellicon. My barren Muse unfit to entertain, Or to assume the name of Poetrie, Although I have presum'd a libertie My tired mind from Prose a while to wean. But if the Muses grant their influence And will my naked fancy but protect All I shall do is wholy to project A way to make them a large recompence; And all the praise that comes (if any be) Is due unto them for inspiring me. Liberty lost. As yet I had not known the rage, and force Of Love, and Passion, when I took my course Unto the Grove where I was us'd to go, And passe the time, (wish it had ne're been so.) And being come unto the place where I Was wont sometimes to walk, sometimes to lie Upon the flow'ry banks of Violet, And Primrose, interwoven, as if set To counterfeit th' Elizium Tapistry; (Who could have thought danger should be so nigh So sweet a place) when forthwith I began To read a while, the story was of Pan, The God of Rural Sports; where Shepherds fell In love with Shapherdesses, and to tell How some one for his love renounc'd a Crown, And spent his time with Sheep upon a Down, At which I smil'd, that man should be so vain, As from a Prince to turn a Shepherd Swain, But note what sudden chance befell, and see, I laught 'tis true, ('twas a sad laugh to me,) For having scan'd the vanity of love, I heard a fluttering noise come from above, When presently there lighted on a tree A winged-boy, (the sight was strange to me) And wondering at the sight, he forthwith took From underneath his wings a Table-book, And threw it at my feet, laying young-man Look well on this and read no more of Pan, And saying so he took in hand his bow, And shot at me. (I since have felt the blow) At which he vanish'd from my sight, when I (Onely in love with curiosity) Unclasp'd the Book, I took it to be so, But 'twas a Picture-case, the which did show A face which I had never seen till then, Which made me to admire it's grace, but when I'de view'd it o're, and o're, I took the case And threw it from me, but the new-seen face Had made so deep impression, that I said, Crying aloud, I am betray'd, betray'd, And rising from the place, I went away, Toward my habitation; but stay, And see my sudden change, I that before Could boast of freedome, presently I tore My Book in pieces, and began to cry Love, Tharldome, Madam, Passion, Liberty; And like a man distracted I began To curse the Winged-boy, and call on Pan, But as I call'd, I heard a silent noise Within the Wood, and after that a voice Which came unto my ear, I heard it say, What have I seen, what have I heard to day? And looking round about me I espi'd (A sight I have repented) by the side Of a small running Brook a Nimph to lie Discoursing to her self of destinie, I heard her say, wish I had never been Abroad to day, or wish I'd never seen The Grove, nor Picture, but since it is so I will forget it all, and so i'le go; And as she spake that word I saw her face, The very same the new-found Picture case Presented me, when I cry'd out 'tis she, She fled and only said 'tis he, 'tis he. A Poem Lyrick Amorea why so Fair, Fairer then the clearest ayre, Brade no more that Auborn hayre, If in love you do not share, Beauty doth beget dispare: Amorea Why so wise, Far above a mortalls prise, Drown no more our gloomy eyes, But accept the Sacrifice, Of a lovers dying cries: Amorea why so High: Why so full of Majesty, Ah shut up that killing eye Which by looking can deny, Only minde the marriage tye: Amorea why so Blest, How so happy in thy rest, Still denying to invest In thy chast, but marble brest, Any lovers interest: Amorea cannot be, Fair but in her puretie; Nor wise but in her Sanctitie, Nor high to any but to me, Nor Blest but in Eternitie: Peace pratling Muse. A Song. Peace pratling Muse do, not declare Her great perfection; Now she doth not lend an eare To thy affection, No alas her thoughts are seated Too, too high to be repeated: Come wandring fancy come away Thou art neglected, Honour bids thee not to stay If disrespected, Never do her parts admire That thy ruine doth desire: End hopeless love, for ever end; She doth not hearken, Her resolutions all do bend Thy hopes to darken, Let her never more delight thee. If but once She seems to slight thee. Away, you vain and fond delights away, be gon, I nere intend on Hymens Rites To think upon, Pardon mee I cannot vow it, For my dear will not allow it: Love at a Stand. 1 Should we but ourselves confine To one setled habitation, Though the place were all divine We should long to change our station. 2 So it was when first I loved. I resolved not to sever, But alas it hath so proved. It was force and, and not Indeavor. 3 Should I say that I adore you You will hardly give me credit, You will say if I implore you In his own words I have read it. 4 That he is unstable, hearken Love hath bred a deep confusion, Your denyals often darken But not change my resolution To Amorea on his going to Sea. 1 Send not a sigh to follow me behind; That were unkind. My totter'd Bark cannot eudure that wind, The force of such a gale Will overset my saile. 2 Drop not a bootless tear into the Sea, That's not the way, Rather be still, and unto Neptune pray, For if you do but weep, Your tears provoke the deep. 3 Yet when I see (too late) the threatning storms. Portending harms, I then shall wish my self within thine armes, Not only there to lie, But only there to die. His Inducement to Love. 1 Doe not think it is your beauty That hath so engaged me, Rather know it is my duty, Or the bonds that Love, and yon tie, Which are onely found in thee. 2 Let not Amorea wonder At my too presumptuous aime, Be but pleased to look yonder On that Coupple, and but ponder, You will find as high extreame. 3 Entertain no thought my dearest, That your fortune did beget A liking, though you are the fairest, And doe far transcend the rarest Nature hath composed yet. 4 No, it is your education, And your vertues that do shine: But it is disconsolation To endure a separation From a vertue so divine. To Amorea from Prison. 1 Come away and blesse the Grate, With thy all commanding eye, Come away, Doe not stay, We have couquered our fate By a suffering Loyalty. We know how to captivate, Chain, and bind captivitie. 2 Come my dearest come and see What it is to have a mind Nobly born, That can scorn, And disdain a Tyrannie, Though the Fates do prove unkind And deny us libertie, Freedome in our chains we find. 3 Come away unto the place, Where the Royal slaves do dwell, Stay a while, Send a smile From that ever blessed face, See, and hear, then go and tell, That our Shackles are a grace, And an honour so farewell. The Authors danger, and deliverance. Haveing left Englands once admired Land, And reacht the Ocean (Neptunes great command) The wind our friend, the sometime boistrious Sea. Lay smooth and calme, such another day Had scarce been seen a day as if it were Composed onely of a silent aire. The foul take pleasure on there flaging wing The Trytons sound, the subtill Syrens sing, The greater fish do leap the lesser Skip. The Princely Dolphyns play about our ship. And thus be calm'd one takes in hand his Lute To play a lesson, this man with a Flute Gives a Leavet, another sings a song, Of Cloris, and a fourth shewes the wrong Of Philamela and her chance. But when It came unto my turn. I took a Pen With resolution for to dedicate A Poem of our calme, and quiet state Unto great Neptune but my Pen and hand, Were stoped by the voice, and known command Of our old Pylot, who a far of spies A Gloomy Cloud, which did begin to rise With pitchie colour, and anon doth cover, The surface of the heavens black all over: And now the winde which was before our friend No sooner rose, but forthwith did contend, Against the happiness which heretofore We did enjoy, the Sea began to roare, The clouds desolved into rain and we Could nothing but our present danger see, The storm rageth and the waves are cast With lofty force far higher then the Mast, The night came on, in which on shoar in peace We use to rest, the tempest doth increase, The moon doth hide her head as loath to be A witness of our dismal tragiedy. The master will not trust unto the helm None but himself, for fear they overwhelm The tottered bark; gives his commands at large That every man stand fast unto his charge, The horrour, and the darkness of the night, Concuring with the danger doth affright Our tired men; again he doth command, Down with the sailes, be nimble now and stand Unto your labour try the pump, and see You lore the top mast, quickly let it be; Now do we wish for day, which now we have, Onely in use to light us to our grave, For with the day the storm doth Augement Which made us see our dangers eminent. The helm is now no longer governed, But by the Sea, the Pilot shakes his head The glass doth cage, the compass standeth still And knowes no North all signes of following ill, The waves do carry us as if we should Salute the clouds, and instantly it would Throw us down headlong, leaving us to see The dangers of the Seas Profundity; Our rigging shatter'd and our sayles are torne The naked mast looks like a man forlorne Nothing but prayer is left, we all implore The God of mercy for a happy shore; One man forgiveness of his sins, doth crave, His prayer is stoped by a cruell wave, This man to heaven sends his dying cries, Till fear had dryed the conduits of his eyes A third weeps for his Children; and another Cries for his Parents, Sister, and a Brother, The fifth doth make a vow, if God doth send Him safe to Land he nere more will offend, Thus all were fearing, praying, vowing. I, After my prayers did Amorea cry, But still the Tempest doth stir up the Sea, Again we labour and again we pray, Then did we Sacrifice, unto the Main Part of our loading but 'twas all in vain For th' unapeased Sea fil'd all again, Thus like a second Babell did we fleet. Confounded in our language, skill and wit, The master cal'd a loud and bid that man To hale a rope, he takes the Quarter-Can And thinkes to drink, but to prevent his care In comes the Sea, and gives a double share Unto us all, the Master bideth some To shift the Ballest, they to Pump do come, Another he commandeth for to shut The hatches, he the Ruther-band did cut Thus all confounded, every one betakes Himself again to prayer, and each one makes Him ready for his death, now hopes are past, And every one doth fear he prayes his last, But God whose mercy alwaies doth extend Beyond his Judgments (mercy without end) In sparing Sinners, when we thought to die The storme abates, and we the land disery When presently a Boy to top is forc'd, Who makes the Land to be the Irish Coast, Whose swelling Seas so boisterous, fearful, rude, Do far exceed their Mountains Altitude, A Coast but too well known for cruell wrack, The Master calls again, commands the Tack To be hal'd close Aboard, away he stears, And in conclusion, (but not void of fears,) We get our haven; where after prayers given Unto the God of Earth, the Sea, and Heaven, With bended knees, erected hands and eyes, We offer prayers, praise, vows, heart-sacrifice; We went ashore, where presently I sped My self of paper, writ, what you have read. Thus God to see where wee'le repent or no, Hath sav'd our lives, Heavens grant we may do so. Hopeless Affection. A Song. 1. Hopeless Affection, flatter me no more, Or else still flatter me, Take from me quickly, ah but first restore My loved destiny, But 'tis the cruell fair Augmenteth my dispair, Yet my unhappy fates, Her love participates. 2. 'Tis Amorea, it is only she, My dying heart hath slain, Pardon me dear mine inhumanitie, Come wound it once again, For where I die or live I freely doe forgive Mine own betraying eyes Made me thy Sacrifice. 3. Come, come away, and kill me with disdain, And then I am set free, When thou hast done, look on the gniltlesse stain, That then doth follow thee: For 'twas mine own desire To steal Celestial fire From off thy beauteous Heaven, Forgive, thou art forgiven. Under his Mistress's Picture. I Rare Artesan, who ere thou art That drew this lively counterfeit, The work doth shew thou art expert, Yet (give leave) 'ts not compleat, The reason is when she is near, Thy workmanship doth not appear. II Had great Apelles present been, Or Sir Vandike, but standing by, And the Original but seen, They both together would deny, And both refuse to take in hand A work that doth their Art command: On his departing. 1 VVhen I was forced to depart From Amorea ever dear, Think you how near A sadness then did touch my heart. 2 An Adamantine Law hath fors't Me to depart and leave my bliss, Ah sure it is A law shall alwayes be accurs't. 3 Yet go I must, and leave behind My happyness unto my greif, And no releif Is left unto my troubled mind. 4 Thus should my Amorea know, Alas she doth, but will not give Any Reprive, Unto my helpless overthrow. A Fancie on Courting. Tis a sport to see our Youth How they do digress from truth, When they summon beauties Fort, And their Ladyes first do court. One will to his Mistress swear, That she is the only fair, And where ever he hath been A sweeter soul he hath not seen. Another sayes his Madam is All his joy, his love, his bliss, And a third perchance will tell That his Lady doth excell. Should one of another Nation, Come and see our Antick fashion, How they wry and bow their bodies To a woman as a Goddess. He would think that they were paying, Vows, unto a Saint, or praying, And but see the Lady stand With her slaves at her command. He undoubtedly would say, That So humble Slaves as they In his travells hath not seen, Or a more adored Queen; Yet if their Ladies seem to yeild They leave the garbe and take the field. On the Curtain of his Mistress's Picture. 1 VVonder-hider tell me why, Thou deniest to our sight, And forbid'st our longing eye, from her most refulgent light. 2 Grand-usurper let us see, Thy (too rich) concealed treasure, That our fancies all with thee, May perticipate in pleasure. 3 Cover-heaven, be but pleased, Thy dark shadows to unfold, Let our greedy sight be eased, With thy more then orient gold. 4 No, we must not see what's under, Thou wilt still deny our suite, Least our eyes be struck with wonder, And our wonder strike us mute. Writ on her Lute. Tell me Princely instrument, Whence proceedeth this content, Doe those taking charms dwell In thee, or her, I prithee tell? Is there power in thy Sound, Not to captivate, but wound? Doth the efficacie live In thee, or else she doth it give? Tell me is it only aire, Can our hearts so much insnare? No, it is her heavenly touch, That concerneth us so much, When her hands do bless thy strings, See the pretty little things How they tremble, yet express Their gratitude with chearfulness, Who is he that would not stand, Trembling if that blessed hand Should but touch him, who is he Would not shake unless a tree; Who is he his joy can smother, Hearing th'one, or feeling th'other. To his Dream. Speak lovely Dream, how could'st thou find Phantesies to shew her mind, Wast not enough to let us see Her face alone, but must we be Alwaies in a such a taking, Quiet neither asleep nor waking. It was but this very night She appeared in my sight, Morpheus having thither sent her, I began to complement her, But the cursed destinies Looking on with jealous eyes, Envious at our happy meeting, Attropus cut off my sleeping, Yet he had gi'n me the leasure To describe the ioy, and pleasure. Of this lovely-loving Dream, Had not waking lost my Theam. Commanded to conceal his Love. 1 Love me, but how, not that it may be known, Love me, and yet take care no love be shown: Love me, but that you love me, still disown. 2 Look not with eyes, that may suspition give, Live still in hope, yet alwaies hope to live, Grieve not at, all but ever seem to grieve. 3 Think not a thought of Love, but yet retain Me in your mind, remember, but refrain, Blot out affection, yet let love remain. 4 Seem still to change, but changes disapprove. Remove your passion, yet in passion move, Doe not as much as whisper out your love. 5 Let fall no word, no thought, no sigh, no tear, Be joyfull, but let joy be mixt with fear, Deny to tell a secret to your ear. 6 For know in love, ther is a such an Art, He loseth all, a councell will impart, Let me be only lodged in thy heart. The Phenix. 1. Often have I wish'd to know Why the Phenix hath her nest far removed in the East, Now the reason I can show. 2. 'Tis because that in the West We 'ave another of her race, But we do not know the place VVhere she will take up her rest. 3. Amorea, it is she, Yet alas, it is not known, And I doubt will ne're be shown, VVhence that happy fire must be: Shall this blessed Phenix burn, And raise young out of her Urn. Loves Elegie.

Hespelon, and Amorea. A Dialogue. Amorea. VVho is it that cometh here, To remove my setled fancies, Hespelon. It is one my onely dear, That hath known all the chances Of a Lovers carefull fear. Amorea. Why alas, is't you my friend! Have not yet those follies left thee? Hespelon. Dear, I never doe intend, Though my fortunes have bereft me Of thy presence, for to end. Amorea. But perchance you will forget me When the Object is removed. Hespelon. Thy opinion sure will fret me, But too dearly I have loved And my passion will not let me. Amorea. Yet I hope these toyes will leave you When you see a fairer creature. Hespelon. No your Author did deceive you It was vertue, and not feature, Which Induced me to crave you. Amorea. When you riper years aspire, May be then your mind will falter. Hespelon. Who is he can quench the fire Or his resolution alter Being taken with desire Amorea. Yet in time and absence you Will forget me, youth is fickle Hespelon. Which if time and absence do Let the all destroying Sickle Cut me from the world too: Amorea. Ah begon my dear I say, Do not longer me Importune Hespelon. (Cursed be that cursed day But more curs't my cursed fortune) Saying So, she went away. On the five Senses. Seeing. If the treasure on the Poe, Ganges, Nile, or Mexicoe, With the Beauty of the world, All at once upon me hurl'd If I cannot see my fair, Wealth is winde, ard beauties air Hearing. If the musick from above, Such as all the Gods do love, Or the subtill Sirens voyce, Were presented to our choyce, If my Misteres do not hearken Ears are deaf, and eyes do darken' Tasting If Ambrosia here were given Or Nepenthe drunk in Heaven, With the most delitious Sallets, That ere pleas'd Ambitious pallets, If my Lady be not pleased, Eyes, Eares, and Tast, are all diseased Smelling. If the Spices of the East, Were ours, that please the Smell, and Tast; All the flowers of Thessalie And perfumes of Italy, If my dearest do not love it, Eyes, Eears, Tast, Smell, disaprove it. Feeling. Now the last (but best) I handle, But for this I need no Candle, If my Mistres do deceive me, And of Feeling should bereave mee, If her Pulse I connot charm, All my Sences do me harme. Loves Liberty. 1 VVhen Cupid had possest my heart With Amoreas Love, And that my more diviner part My meaner fancies prove, When my affections all were crost And she did me deny, The fallen Angell only lost So great a Liberty. 2 When not obtaining deep dispair Had conquered my minde And that a kinde of hopeless fear Did all my wishes blinde Wheu I shall call to minde the day That first I did her see, With captiv'd soules I then may say I had a Liberty. 3 When with a Swan-like Song I sing My Amoreas grace, My Muse must then in changes ring The wonders of her face, When with her all commanding Love My passions are set free, The Spirits of the Elizium grove Have no such Liberty. 4 When as I hear her heavenly name My Sadness is supprest, And nothing but a Loyall flame Doth harbour in my brest, When with a look my greif is hurl'd By the charmes of her eye, Onely the Sun that Rules the world, Doth know Such liberty. A Dream. VVhen Morpheus had possest mine eies With sleep, and unconfined thought Did stray, it to my fancy brought The Image I so highly prize. Sometimes I seem to see my dear Tempted with a golden shower, And yet so constant that their power, Cannot change the mind of her. Another time unto my greif I think I see her for to yeild, And almost give up the feild Destitute of my Releif. Then do I see (but grive to see) A Rivall doth my place possess And hath all the happiness Which was onely due to me. Yet at last if not deceived, Amorea is unmoved, No one but my self she loved, Waking then my joyes bereaved. His complaint to the Groves. Groves-inhabitants draw near, Afford your aide, Let it no more be said That I doe live; Ah come and drop a tear, Your sorrow give, But no reprieve. Yet grant (oh grant) that I may dwell Within your bowers, My few remaining howers, Whilest I relate, And shall in dying tell, I'me made by fate Unfortunate. But witness how I loyal die, And that I take My death for her sweet sake, For when I found That she did me deny, Death gave the wound, Adue, I sound. To his Ingenuous Friend, J. P. Esq; on Limbing. Speak ingenuous Friend of mine, Be but pleased for to shew, In what Regent or what Clime Do those heavenly coullers grow. We admire the mistery, Of thy hidden secret Art, Which not only fills the eye, But doth captivate the heart. Here the heedless Lover views, The well known adored face Of his Mistress, straight renews Hopes, and symptomes of new grace. Here a piece like Beauties Queen, That a winning modesty, Then an humble pride is seen, Thus a stately Majesty. Here a Countenance is sad, Ready to dissolve in tears, There a face that looks half glad, Intermixt with joy and fears. Whence are thy rare Pencills brought, Whence thy Art, and in what place, Colours are, paint love and thought, And declare it in the face. Surely thou hast gotten wings, For to fetch this heavenly dye, For they are not Terrene things, Can so wound both heart and eye. A Fancie. From whence Unthought of fancie, com'st thou now from whence, Is thy pretence, To disengage me of a fixed friend; From whence, Hast thou the pow'r to overthrow the sense, Which cannot end, But in the love of her to whom, I doe pretend. Away, Heart-wounding Cupid, now be gone, away Ah do not slay, My bleeding fancies with thy cruell dart, But stay, And let me think upon that happy day, In which thy Art, Did first obliege me to that glorious Ray, Else quickly strike my heart.

Limbner. And if you die before me, to be sure Your name shall alwaies live by Portraiture. A Pastorall Poem. Phylacona having early (In a morning that had fairly Promis'd the ensuing day All the glory of the May) With a mellancholly pace Come at Length unto the place, That for Phylaconas love, Called was the Goddess grove, Here she used still and wholy, For to treat her Mellancolly; Here she entertain'd her sadness, Though the place did promise gladness, For there was the loving Vine, With the stately growing Pine, Ranks of Cedars there were seen, And the Lawrell, Forrests Queen, Next the Cipress, and the Yew Did present themselves to vew, There a Bow'r of Kear is made, Here a lovely Mertle shade, With the Ivy and the Bayes That do crown the Poets Layes Here the Poplar, there the Thorne Which hath Phylamela born And in every tree there stood, The Musitions of the wood, Starlin, Lennet, and the Thrush, Crown'd the top of every bush; Underneath was to be seen, (Running through) a spangled green Well composed into Bowers All enamelled with flowers; As if Nature meant to show What her art was able do; Was a brook or little River, Which did seem for to deliver In its Language all the story, Of that Nymphs Eternall glory, Who (as Poets have Inserted) Was into a stream converted. Heer She used to retyre, And the very same desire. To be private in his Sorrow Made her shepherd bid goodmorrow To his sleeping, and to rise, Shaking Slumber from his eyes, “Sorrow would not let him stay “For to entertain the day, “But commanded him away And to the grove did fortune hurry Him, as she began her story: When she thither was arived Being of all joyes deprived, Only taken up with care. This sad voice did reach his eare, Which at first he had neglected, Being with his greif-affected, Yet because he would not be Taxed for discourtesie; Round about him as he pried, The sad Nymph he had espied Who her tender limbs had laid On a mantle that was spred, “On the painted Tapistry, “Of the flower-paved walkes and night “To the River did she lie. And because he thought her fate To his sadness did relate, He supposing that her care In his Sorrows had a share, Out of Curiositie Hid himself behind a tree; Thus the Nymph being on the ground After she had looked rownd, Thinking on her present feares Thus began her tail with tears; Who can better tell then I, To deplor the destiny Of a sad forsaken Maid, Only by my self betrayed, I that in the height of life When the Graces were at strife Which should have the greatest prise Language, carriage, voice, or eyes, I who ever have been Courted With the noblest, and consorted With the most Gentieler sort, And knew nothing but the Court Nothing then could please me better Then to read an humble Letter, Such as Lovers do present All compos'd of Complement, Thus when I shall call to minde What is past I then do finde All the happy hours are spent Which to youth are incident, And can see nothing of truth Harbour in unsetled youth, Yet when I shall think upon The forsaken Espilon (VVho by his disloyalty Hath so disobleiged me) Needs I must declare his worth: VVith which words he steped forth, Knowing this the first time For to vindecate his crime, VVith heavy pace and look Being come unto the brook After he himself had seated, His excuse he thus repeated, Madam if your very Servant Have not still with wishes servant Prosecuted your affection, Never give my love protection, Only you to have enjoyed Be both wish and love destroyed Or if ever I have loved More then you your self Approved, May my Love be still neglected, And my falsness be dedected, May my heart be ever grived, May my vowes be not believed, If I do not thee desire, Then let heart and vowes expire; Therefore dearest? Here his hands would fain have brooken Truce, if that she had not spoken And her angry commands Did forbid his longing hands, Espelon, quoth she, my dear, Leave me, least I justly fear, That your carriage will deceive me; Yet for this I do forgive thee, But be sure you are not quitted, For the punishment is fitted, You forever shall be banish'd; Saying so, away she vanish'd, Like an airy broken bubble, Leaving him unto his trouble, VVhereunto this Pastorall tended, No man knows, for here it ended. To Amorea on his going to Travell. 1 If that my Travell were to be so far, (My only starre) To come again no more, Then well I might implore, Pardon from Cupid, and loves deitie, For the offence I've done to Love, and thee. 2 Yet Amorea be but pleased now To take this vow, If Fortune be my friend, To grant a happy end Unto my journey; offer up I shall, To thy blest shrine, my vows, my self, and all. 3 But if I never do return, Alas I mourn, For her I left behind, Yet dearest be so kind, Only to think, I only for your sake, This journey with my death did undertake. Writ at Sea. Now had I bid farewell unto the Land, And left behind that ever blessed shoare Blessed because it Amorea bore. Yet could not leave to look upon the sand; For now my grief began I took in hand My Pen, in which my fancies heretofore Did once delight, for why, it did restore My hopes; but heark, the voice I do adore, Commandeth back, who can that voice withstand, 'Tis Amorea, it is her command. To Cloris, imploring a revenge. Cloris stay, and do not flie, Give an eare to my Petition, Which I offer up and make, With submission, And contrition, That when you do vengeance take, For dispenced loyaltie, Take it only of her eye. For to captivate a lover, Let it never more have power, Take away it's former grace, May a shower Spoile the flower, Of her once admired face, Where she loveth, ah remove her, Let her love, but still above her. Cloris, hark to my desire, And behold my Sacrifice, Do not passe too hard a sentence, Drown her eyes, With her cryes, Let her know a sad repentance, But take mercy in thine ire, 'Cause I once did her admire. In praise of Sack. From where, or whence, at first this Liquor came, Or how it had it's being none can tell, Where the Pierian Fount did give it name, Or where it flow'd from Agganippe-Well, Is now the question, truely I am one That do believe the thing which we call Sherry, Was planted first in sacred Hellicon, Produced of some strange Celestial Berry; One of the reasons, that doth move me to it, A reason I prefer before the best, I never yet could meet a piece of Poet But lov'd to take a glass beyond the rest, And there is reason for't; 'twill make his pen Run faster then his Muse is able think, It sets him far above the reach of men, Such is the vertue of this versing drink, 'Twill raife a drooping spirit to the height 'Twill send a known Coward unto the wars, The tast so heavenly, and the look so bleigh, That some do hold it is dissolved Starrs, But be it what it will, I never yet Have found his equall, not in any thing, It makes a man his sorrow to forget, Equall's the lowest, with the greatest King, What is it 'twill not doe; yet there are some That from my praises far enough do vary, Who by their carriage shew from whence they come And ne're were so well bred to drink Canary, And this I know, they are no Gentlemen, That (in that very thought) such drink deny, Which is the Scholars Study, Poets pen, The Lawyers guide, the Lovers deitie, All that the Poets feign, of Nectar is, Composed in this little Sea of bliss, Then Drawer bring it in, the hurt I'le do 'em, Is drink to all, that do believe this Poem. A SONG. I cannot say you are forsworn, Since you have proved true, And yet I think my self forlorn, VVhen by your actions still I view, Your fancy's ranging for a new. 'Tis true, you loved me a while, But soon your love was cold, Then think no more on Beauties guile, For your embraces are grown old, And have no force my heart to hold. I see the Treasures of that face, VVhich once I doted on Is to be found in every place, And all the fleeting graces gone, There's nothing left to look upon. Yet when you 'ave seen the worlds store, And where the Beauties be, Reclaim your self, Ile ask no more, But am content the spoiles to see Alone devoted unto me. On loving of two. Ladies that you both may know, What yo to your Servant owe, I have both you adored, And have both your loves implored. If I did but set mine eye, On the one, and th'other by; I could nothing but admire, Being corch'd with double fire. Should I on Clariana look, I doe open Beauties book, Where such lessons I do find, As they captivate my mind. If I look upon the first, Though she have been too too curst, Yet I think new hopes of grace Are in Amorea's face. But that hope is soon defaced, If Clariana will be pleased To allow me in her sight, Counting it my chief delight, Amorea's love engageth, And a war within me wageth, Clariana's sweet affection, Then must serve for my protection. If Clariana should be ill, I do all her sickness feel, But for Amorea's trouble, I consume into a bubble. Should Clariana be but pleased, All my sorrows are appeased; Yet if Amorea mourn. All my joyes to sorrow turn. Those who Amorea've seen, Say she is the Elizium Queen, And that Clariana's face, Only came from Phenix-race. Scarce can I suppress the flames, Sent by those adored Dames; VVere it not their haughty scorn, VVas to heavy to be born. But now all is past and ended, Had not Hymen me befriended, I would never more have loved, Had he not my mind disposed. Saying if I chance to find One that parallels the mind Of these Ladies I have named, She it is for me is framed. The Shadow. 1 Yesterday as I was seated, And lay sleeping in an Arbour, See my hopes were all defeated, And were shipwrack'd in their Harbour, For I thought I had been taking All my treasure in myne armes, But it prov'd when I was waking, Nothing else but false alar'ms, Yet it troubles me the less, For the Gods had like success. 2 One of them as doth appear In their Tale, for anger burned When he saw his only dear, To a shining Cloud was turned, A second made his labour vain; And another we do see, For his Nimph embrac'd a stream, And the third a Lawrell-Tree; Thus the Gods themselves were used, And with shadows are abused. 3 So it was with me alas, When I thought I had my fair, Like a shadow she did pass And nothing left but fleeting air; Then I waked discontented, In a posture nigh disparing, But my sadness was prevented, By her personall appearing, But nothing I of substance write Whil'st of shadowes I Indite. To Amorea walking in her Garden. See how all things do conspire, And agree with her desire, For when she doth blesse the walkes On each side the Verdure stalkes As if waiting her commands, Bowe themselves to kisse her hands, And the early growing bush, VVhose rare flowers now do blush, Joying that they're in the way, To her lap their Tribute pay And as she her self disposeth So the Marigold discloseth And her Inward parts discover As to the Sun her constant lover, Then when she her body shadeth Straight the Heliotropian fadeth, Other flowers take new birth; From her presence, scorn the earth, By imploring a divorce, From their mother, and their nurse, “See the Tulips how they bow “Down their golden heads, and how “In dumb elloquence they woe Hopeing that, that Blessed hand, VVill confine them for to stand, In some window there to be In her presence till they die, Lilly, Juliflower and Pancy, All submit unto her fancy And her pretty fingers do pray t'accept their offering too, Hundreds more as good as they Do come thronging in her way, To exchange their libertie For a sweet captivity, Thus being sated with delight She begins for to unite Them into a Garland, and With her sweet composing hand: Crown'd her sleeping shepheard, whom Little thought it was his dome, Then with humble grace she bowed, To the rest, who being proud Of their happiness to meet, In the Allies with her feet; Thus she being gone away, (Ah that dismall fatall day) The poor youth as soon as he Waked, found his destenie, And with that began to tear All the favours which he ware In her honour, and his crie Was disloyaltie I die. So the Garland which she gave Served to adron his grave. To Mr. James Sherley on his playes. Mirrour of Comedies, and of our age, That hast re-edified the falling Stage And once more built the Theatre with thy pen, In Spight of foes, hast made it live agen; What can we render, thy Admired Playes, Already have sequestered the Bayes From of the head of those who writ before, Which were but shadows to thy works, no more. Who is not joyed when he seeth the fall, And punnishment of vice, thy Cardinall And taught by thy Imposture for to shun Lascivious courses, or else be undone: Thy Brothers teach us love; thy Sisters do; In courtly tearms, shew us how to woe. Or if we will be read in points of State, Then thy Court Secret make us up compleat, What shall we offer then, or what Present, Wee'l add this Trophey to thy Monument That ages yet to come shall hear and see, VVhen dead, thy Works a living Elegie. On the perfection of Beauty. Gaze not on starr's whose twinckling light The spangled glory of the night: Nor on the Suns refulgent eye Darting Silver from the sky: Look not on Spotless Ermines tho' For whitness they excell the Snow, Nor pretty Turtle-Doves who be. The emblimes of lov'd amity: Think not on Muses, graces, now, Nor the Seven wonders we allow, Nor would I have you think upon The Poet-nursing Hellicon Wonder not why, Pearls vallued are, Or Rubies why acconnted rare, or Diamonds who sparkleforth At once their luster and their worth: For If Clariana come in sight, Stars do fall and lose their light, The Sun Eclips'd doth post away, And sets an end unto the day. Ermines run into disgrace, Baffled when they see her face. Turtles dying leave the Grove To see themselves out-gone in love: The Muses, Graces, Wonders seven, Are vext that now they are made even. Mount Hellicon her self doth fear All Poesie doth flow from her: Pearles are mad that now they must Be look't upon as glittering dust. Rubies asham'd, away did skip, And vow'd a vengeance on her lip; Diamonds for grief have sworn, That they'le never more be worn. Thus starrs are falen, the Sun is fled, Ermines baffled, Turtles dead, The Muses, Graces, Hellicon, The Wonders, vex, fear, as undone, Pearls, Rubies, Diamonds, are mad, shame, sware, And all because Glariana is so fair. To his unconstant Mistress. VVhat, only constant in unconstancie? And true alone to mutability? Like the still changing wind That moves the curles of thy hair, Kill, or be kind, Dissolve or bind The double knot of my dispair, Speak life, or let me die. For wing'd with hope, and baffled by disdain, I think I am not safe, nor am I slain, Yet puft up with desire, To reach my earthly happiness, My hopes exspire, In the fire Of dull flaming heaviness, Burnt up, yet live again. So in the ballance of hope, love, and fear, Secur'd by confidence yet drown'd in care, I once more come to trie, And once again implore, If you deny, Although I die, I vow ne're to affect thee more, Believe me when I swear. An Elegie on the Death of the Princess Royal. Goe, Ladies, stay, ah goe, no stay and mourn A while, lay down your Lutes, ah come &amp; turn Your deep concerned eyes upon this Tombe, Read, and lament, as if you read your doom Alas make haste, come pay your Obsequies Unto her memory with drowned eyes, Attend this Monument, forget to see Your selves carrassed, may you ever be, In mourning habits, and where e're you walk, May death and Funeralls be all your talk, And if you sleep, may your dreams be of Bells, Of Hearses, Coffins, Monuments, and Knells, May all your daies of pleasure and delight, Be Metamorphosed to dismal night, For Vertue's dead, and in her all is gone That Vertue's very self can think upon; Now certainly a wrack is to be fear'd, For gon's the Star, and North, by which you stear'd, Gone is the Touch-stone, which was wont to try Whither was richer love, or constancy; Gone is your Torch, and gone away your Sun; Your Lights extinguish'd e're it was begun, Nothing is left but mourning, but you'l say Who it should concern or dismay, Or so obliege us HER to think upon; Is't not enough to tell you Vertue's gone: It is the Princess whom I'de nam'd, but when I name Her once, grief drownds my tongue and pen. To Phyla. Phyla I will not enquire, What hath been thy past desire, Nor is't fitting you should know Unto whom I've made a vow, Prithee Phyla tell me now What has made thee to retire, Is it 'cause I do admire Other beauties, is it so? Tell me Phila, I think no, For I still retain the fire Which was kindled long agoe In my mind, and flameth higher, If I chance to come but nigh her; Phyla wilt thou know who 'tis, Speak (thy self) thou can'st not misse, The difference between a Lute, and a Via It fell out the other day, Two Ladies busie at their play, Th'one a Vial with her voice, Did accord a Heavenly noise, Th'other a Theorboe held, Which when they the Room had fill'd, With their Musick then it was, Striving which of them could pass Each the other, (then say I,) Musick was Divinity; Madam, quoth the first, I think, If Napenthe be a drink That doth reconcile the Gods When they chance to fall at odds, Certainly without denial, 'Tis distilled through a Vial; Quoth the other to confute Your argument, why not a Lute, And I comming in the while, They began to blush and smile, Saying both, you that so well Of Love do undertake to tell, And have ventur'd to set forth In a Poem the rare worth, That in Musicks charms lie, Speak without partiality, Which is fitter for Love's Quire, Amphion's Lute, or Orpheus Lire; Thus betwixt a Scila I, And Charibdis then did lie, Should I dare to say a Lute, Farewell my intended suite; Or if I a Vial praise, Then my Mistress I displease, Will you take a Poets oath, Then by Sack I pleas'd them both, Amphion's Lute I did advance, Because it made the stones to dance, And when they had found the trial, Which was sweeter Lute or Vial, With the reason both were mute, Both concluding 'twas a Lute. The Change. 1 Chloe, I wondring in my mind, Why men do such changlings prove, Now the very cause I find, 'Tis occasioned by love, And no judgement from above. 2 First I found it in my self, For I was not born so, Yet alas the pievish Elf Needs must have a Mistress too; Pardon Chloe, 'tis not you. 3 VVhich when I had gotten, I Lost within a day or two Though I told her I could die For her love; there came a new, Made me bid the old adiew. 4 Thus I chang'd for Chloe's sake, After I had made a vow, VVhich I changed and did make Others that are broken now, VVhich my Chloe must allow. 5 For I'me chang'd from hope to fears, See what Chloe's love can doe, Changed even in my prayers, Believe me Chloe it is true, Chang'd to all, but King, and you. To Amorea. A Song. Amorea, when that you Honour with your sweet repeating, My poor fancies, then I doe Think the Heavens are compleating, All my joyes, and pleasures too. Yet the cause I cannot shew, Unless it be for this reason, That you know it is your due, When in Verse I mean to praise one, All the glory's meant to you. For when I begin to vow Clariana is my fairest, Or do Chloes love allow, Or say Phyla is my dearest, All do end in you you know. What say, can you then deny; But the reason I have found, 'Tis because that they and I Swear your Beauty is the ground, Make us call you deity. On the Inequalletie of Marraige. Tis strange to see the unavoided fate Of many in this humour when to late They find their errour, one per chance will cry VVhat should I do against my destiny, Antoher half destracted will perswade He's happier in the maid then if he had, Obtain'd the Mistres, think fond youth if wise Is't better draw a blanck, or have a prize, Yet if thou'lt Marry and their be no friend Can disingage thee of thy Madness, lend And eare to reason, first be sure you see Where she do correspond in quallitie, Not that i'de have you fly too high, and so Like Iccarus you drown your self, no, no, I'me not for such a Marriage, for I've read Of Eagles feathers, if put in a bed All other feathers instantly consume Devouring those that are not of their plume Yet on the contrary, I'de have you show, Your self from whence you came go not so low: To draw a scorn upon Posteritie For that's a blemish that will never be Extinquish'd but by time and perchance you. Stooping too low will be Extinguish'd too, Is it not pitty that it should be said The Son and heir will have a Chamber-maid, And who can help it, when it is their doom The onely daughter doates upon a groom: And so destroy all that their father got By wit, or valour, Industry, or lot, But hearken youth, if not infatuate To all misfortunes, let's expostulate, Why should a Goss-hawke fly at Titmice, or What need a Faulcon stoop unto a Dor Are not there Princely fowls enough, but they Must be content on Butterflyes to prey, What follies this, are there not mediums left To be embrac'd, but just like men bereaft Of sence and reason, we must headlong run We know not where, before we are undone, Can we not be content to change our name By transmutation to the very same It was before, when suffering Loyaltie Shall still be lov'd by noble Honesty What would you have, would you joyn Land to Land Do it, provided you go hand in hand, In age, birth, fortune, Love, if not take care What you do think is good may prove a snare, And if these reasons will not serve the turn, Fly like, play with the candell, till you burn And then you'le let the world for to see Marraige, and Hanging goes by destiny. Clariana's Dream. 1 Clariana slept, and as she slept, The God of Night stood by; The God of Love for anger wept, That he could not be nigh. 2 Clariana wept, and weeping cry'd, (O'rewhelmed with her care,) VVhat hast thou ask'd, that I deny'd, Speak Hespelon my dear. 3 Clariana wak'd, and waking found That all was but a Dream, She sigh't, and fell into a sound, But ne're reviv'd again. Love and Respect. 1 It is not that I love the fairest, Less then when my love I tendred, But 'twas hopeless love, my dearest, That my deep affection hindred. 2 Yet 'tis not hopeless love shall fear me, Or command my love to end, 'Tis the high respect I bear thee, Will not leave me to offend. 3 Were I confident to carry, Thy affection it would be No content at all to marry, If the conquest were not free. 4 But if you vouchsafe to pardon My presumption, do but prove, I will render thee the geurdon Of a never-dying love. The Authors dream. Not long agon being thrown upon my bed Repleat with Sorrow, my unsetled head With Perturbation of a troubled minde Turn'd giddy with it's cares, no rest could finde, It was about the hour that the clock Had strucken two, the early waking Cock, Had gi'n his first Allarum to the day, Sleep seas'd my drowned eyes, and greif gave way To nature to (exact her tribute) when Somnious who doth command the eyes of men: Did charm me first asleep, then sent a dream The which disturbed my late setled brain, And thus it was, me thought I had set forth, A little Pinnice, which towards the North Was bound with swelling sayles: a lofty winde Yet not to high encountred me behinde: The Symptomes of a happie voyage and all Good fortune on our side did seem to fall For having past the Isles of th' Orcades Norvegia, Thule, (next the frozen Seas) And having more then hopes to reach our Port Neptune as if he meant himself to sport, With our mishapes, bid the winds blow and they No sooner were commanded but obey And every thing conforming to his will Made us to soon to see onr cause was ill When after all our Masts and rigging spent With all misfortunes that are Incident. To Saylers in storme: we discry'd Two other Vessels driven with the Tide? And labouring for their Haven but they found To soon unto their loss, themselves a ground The Climate where we were, and the degree Was known to them, and not unknown to me The Northern Amazons possest the Land Their Queen Clarianna, under whose comand The Countrie flourisht, and the very place Where the Ships stood, night to her Palace was Yet could not I so happy be as they, For when I had recovered the Bay A second storm did assail us and Neptune to Eolus had given his hand To make us only wretched as if both Had past their pledges by a mutuall Oath To Thunder down their vengeance for the most That each of them could do, we felt the worst But that I may not Vary from my Theam Because 'tis pertinent unto my Dream, Know the two Ships were driven to the Land And stuck half buryed on a Bar of Sand. On the Ports Star-boord fide the one was fast Th' other a little to the Larboord cast. Betwixt them was the River wherein we Must thrust our torn vessel or else be Ingulf'd in sudden ruin; at which I Spake to the Master with a hastie cry: Demanding his advice, and what to do: Quoth he our evils now are more then two; For if to windward of that ship we stand Then ours will be involved in the Sand To Leeward of the other should we fall, Undoubtedly we lose ship, men and all: For every side ther's danger, should we steer Betwixt them both, on every hand ther's fear; Of falling soul, again, if we should trust Unto our Anchors, that's the very worst. Well this is to be done (and what de'e think) We'le in betwixt them, if we sink, we sink: These were his words, and in this very Fashion He brought them out, but hold the Scituation Of Clarianna's Pallace shall be shown, For such a gracefull object must be knowe. The house was seated on a rising hill, Inshrin'd with Cyprus trees but here my quill Will prove deficient, should I bnt talke: Or set the graces forth of every walk. If on the buildings I should write or look My pen would run it self into a book. But Il'e decline the hill again for fear I should forget my Dream and end it there, Which must not be before I let you see What happened in my Dream and unto me, For being Sad and pensive in my minde 'Cause I could not th' interpretation finde: I grew more troubled, but this accident My greif and sorrows quickly did prevent; It seem'd to me I saw before mine eyes The ground to open, and a man to rise? Whose venerable age had showred A Snowy benediction on his head, And in one hand (me thought) he helde a Globe, And in the other was an Astralobe The moon upon his head, a glittering Coate Spangled with starrs he ware which did denote What he had been in his foregoing years 'Tis like he knew the motion of the Spheres: The heavens Influence which doth iufer The man had been a great Astronomer. And thus he spake: Come hither musing youth Know that thy Dream hath somthing in't of truth Sit down, observe, remember what is told, And thus he did begin my Dream t'unfold. The Pinnice thou wert in doth Signify, Thy very self; the Swelling sayles thy high Ambitious aime; the wind that followed thee Portendeth all good hap undoubtedly; The countries thou did'st pass by and the Seas Shew thou hast mist some fortunes in thy daies: But nothing lost, next did I list to show Who Neptune is but will not for I know To soon thou'lt finde it out: for it is he Will crosse thy hopes, and then remember me: The falling of thy mast denoteth plain Obstructions will impede and intervean Betwixt thee and thy wish; the other two That seemed ships are men as well as you: And that I may not speak misteriously They are thy Rivalls who most certainly, Will do their utmost and the haven is No other but your vertuons Mistress: Their going a ground their want of Judgment and Doth shew they were to young to take in hand. So great a voyage; the Climate and degree, Her name and quallitie I'me sure must be? That they were Amazons, it doth dilate A sprightly Lady; the Queens name, her state: That the ships Strook, so nigh her palace sure Shews the unhappiness they must endure And that the bay thou reachest it doth tell After the storm is past it may goe well, That Eolus and Neptune did combine, Doth say two crossing Councellors will joyn To blow up thy designes, but they'l be crost, For be contented they are like to lost Their thankless labours; that the ships strook I'me bold To let thee know, by sand is meant her Gold; Betwixt them did the River run; that doth The Ladies equal couldness shew to both, Thy hasty crie be sure doth intimate, Thou make dispatch, or else 'twill be too late. The man of whom thou did'st implore advice, Is thy best friend in Council; if thou'rt wise Observe his words, be sure thou understand The dangers threatned on every hand, The Masters last advice doth shew to thee That resolution must not wanting be; The Gracefull Pallace, and it's scituation, It shews the Ladies vertuous education, That it was seated on a rising hill, Declares her Birth and Beauty, which thy Quill Can never praise enough, the Trees set fourth Her noble parts, the Walks her grace and worth. Thus have I shew'd thee all, and lastly I, Am called by the name of Ptollomy, At which I wondred when I thought upon He died many hundred years agon: And then I answer'd, saying, Reverend Sage, Thou hast not let me know her name nor age, But what I said was spoken to the wind, For he was vanished, yet left behind, A role of Paper, which I greedily Snatch'd from the ground, and read as hastily, And thus it did contain, If any do For curiosity, desire to know What course the Pinnace took, and what became Of the two ships, or what the Ladies name, With the conclusion? let thy answer be, 'Tis wholly left unto Astronomie, To give a happy period to the thing, And reading here, sleep with a hastie wing Began to fly me, yet the time was given To read these following words, 'Tis only Heaven Can give a blessing, and compose thy cares, 'Tis Heav'n must be propitious to thy prayers, Commit thy waies to Heav'n, and Heaven will Direct thee what to do, protect thee still, And Heav'n will bless thee sleeping, keep thee waking: And thus I waked when these words were speaking. To the Sun. 1 Goe Glorious Sun, Set in perpetual night, I shun thy light, Now she is gone In whom all joyes did shine, My darkned sight Can see nothing that is divine. 2 Goe glorious Sun, And tell her brighter Ray I come away, Tell her I run, My coming is not far, The message can be done By none but thee unto a Starr. On the Death of his Mistress. 1 Ask me not why the Rose doth fade, Lillies look pale, and Flowers die, Question not why the Mirtle shade, Her wonted shadows doth denie. 2 Seek not to know from whence begun The sadness of the Nightingale, Nor why the Helletrope and Sun, Their constant Amitie do fail. 3 The Turtle's grieflook not upon, Nor why the Palm-tree doth mourn, When Widow-like they're left alone, Nor Phenix, why her self doth burn. 4 For she is dead which life did give Unto those things that here I name, They fade, change, wither, cease to live, Pine, and consume into a flame. On His Sacred MAJESTIES haypy Restauration. Have you not seen after some boisterous night The Sun's approach, when he salutes our sight, Have you not view'd the lusttre that it yields, In gilding everything, the very Fields As yet bedew'd with tears, and coulds anoy, Do weep and smile together both for joy; Just so it is with us: hark what a noise Runs through the Land, all to express our joyes: Our Sun's return'd unto his longing Land, And brought Amnistia with him in his hand, Never did Persians rejoice to see The Sun they worship, half so much as we; Nor Greenland that hath darkness half the year, Is not so joy'd when the Sun doth appear, To stay six moneths within that Hemisphere. Our King hath brought Religion home, &amp; peace, Attended on with with plenty and increase; We know no war, no sword, no fierce Alar'ms, But from Arm, Arm, we now goe arm in arm; A blessed change, a such a change as this Surpasseth any Metamorphosis, Where men are turn'd to Monsters, here we see Monsters put off their inhumanitie, Here is the golden age return'd agen, The Lamb takes up his rest in th' Lions den, The very Pirates they turn Merchant-men; And those who but a while agoe would slay, Any of those they thought stood in their way: And nothing heard of discord one with th'other, There's no name known, unless the name of Brother; And of our wrongs there's no reiteration, A happy turn, a blessed Restauration, See but the carrying on this mighty thing; When we'd tri'd all, there's nothing but a King Could heal our breaches, and when he was come, All interests had their satisfaction, And note the carriage of the work, and then You'l see the hand of God, 'twas not of men, The difference was composed, for we find So many thousands to be of one mind, And all agree in one, observe but this, Both Land, and Sea, concurred in our bliss, It is observable, the Moneth of May, Did post unto her Nine and twentieth Day, That day which first gave life unto our KING, Was double blessed by his Coming In: Should we abuse this mercy, (but 'tis sin To think a thought to let Rebellion in) By breaking of this happy Union, When all is buried in Oblivion, 'Twould be a means such curses for to bring, As Heaven defend us from. God save the KING. To the most Honoured Sir James Smith Knight, On his many favours received. SIR, I fear my boldness may impute me rude, And to say nothing were ingratitude; Can I for favours had of such a one, Burie my thanks in dark oblivion, And where I ought to pay all thankfulness. Render my self base, by forgetfulness; Should I which have received from your hand, Of bounty, so much kindness; should I stand, Without acknowledgement, as if that I Were quite devested of civility; No, no, such Boons as those, must needs require Returns, which (in some measure of desire) Should testifie, a gratefull mind, in part He payes such debts, which has a thankfull heart, And such my payment for these loves, must be Pay'd by good wishes, to eternitie. To Celinda. 1 Come Celinda, come away, Sweet Celinda do not stay, Bless our longing longing-eyes, Harken to your Shepherd's cries, That doth vow, To allow Every year unto that day Such a thankfull Sacrifice, As he 'th sworn for to slay Half his Flock: come, come away. 2 And when my Celinda shall Make me happy by a call, Saying Shepherd now I come, See Alexis be at home; Then I'le make, For her sake A Holy-day throughout the Vale. Giving all my Flock to some Shepherd, that hath known all My love. I hear Celinda call. EPIGRAMS. On a simple Gentleman which spake in dispraise of Poetry. A gentleman, for want of education, Said Epigrams, and Poems, were but toyes. And in his judgement and small estimation, Are only fit for Girles, and for Boyes: Another standing by that wished well To Poetry, and lov'd a witty Rhime, Your judgement Sir, alas what can you tell? Thus 'tis to cast a Pearl before a Swine, Pray hold your peace, for Poets hold it fit, That Ignorance must not be Judge of Wit. On my want of Money. VVhat though I want Pecunia, what of it, I never passed such a merry age, As when I did employ my little wit, To free my self of this sad Pilgrimage, But by experience I find Poetry, 'Tis sad to tell, shakes hands with poverty. On a Vintner A vintner on a time did me perswade To make an Epigram upon his Trade, Only the love of Sack did make me write. They're glad to see men drop, but will not fight, And yet are alwaies Drawing, which implies, When others fall, such Knaves as they do rise. On a Lawyers Wife. A lawyer did complain unto his Wife, He ne're had such a Tearm in all his life; Content your self (quoth she) but this Vacation, And the next Tearm I'le use my Occupation, For with my Little Common Law I've found A trick in Plea, to get me many a pound. On a Taylor. A taylor that for me had made a Suit, 'Twas Allamode, and all things fitting to't, But when I put it on, I was in wrath, Telling the Rascall he had stole my Cloth, It is too short said I, thou'st made it ill, Be pleas'd (quoth he) I'le length'nt with my Bill. On a Poetaster. A poetaster of our latter times Began to versefy upon the Vine He ask't me my oppinion of his rhimes: I told him they were very like our wine What do you mean quoth he are they not good: Yes Passing good said I, if understood. On Frenetta. Frenetta is a gamster most men know, Yee she will venture all on a good cast: And though her fortune be but bad at throw She hopes to keep an oppen point at last, Then be as fortunate, as e're you can, Frenetta's sure to carry the first Man. On a Deboist Scoller. Scollasticus with much Phillosophy, Began to praise the University? And after three years study now he see's That he is able for to take degrees All men that know him, see that he is able At Tavern, Tenness, Dice, and Biliard-table For by degrees, he'ath learnt a way of late, To spend a very fair, and large estate. On a Coukold. Old Curno, and his young new married Wife Had ne're a quiet hour in all their life For in their Jarring, this is still his noat Telling his wife, she was not worth a groat Thou ly'st quoth she, for thou hast more with me Then ever I am like to have by thee, Why, what, you base confounded Whore quoth he Nornes, Coukold, Knave, if I a Whore must be. On a Duble Marraige Sir Seldom-Sober, and his eldest Son; Came to Sir. Idle-Spend thrifts dwelling place After the Cerremonies all were done, Young Sober ask't to see his Daughter Grace. Is that your errand Sir (quoth Spendthrift) here She hath not been with me I know not when, Nor yet with us quoth Sober for I swear, I've seen her not this twenty years and ten; Pardon me then quoth Spendthrif, you must tary For Cosen Jermans are forbid to Marry. On a Zealous Brother. Rotundus prayeth much and singeth Psalmes Gives to the poor, but will not have it known And when that he distributeth his Almes: No Trumpet shall within his gate be blown: By this the world may plainly Judge and see Rotundus is not what he seems to be. On a Lawyer. A lawyer is a man, I know not how For to discribe him right as I should do, For if a man another chance to sue, He's for the Plaintif and Defendant too? And though I'me cheated yet unto his face God bless your worship, how goes on my cause Why well quoth he, povided that this Bill Be sattisfyed, or else it may go ill; They are the painful'st men in all the nation And why, they ca'nt abide a long Vacation: Yet if my cause be spoild, he must be prais'd Give them good Tearmes and then the Knaves are pleas'd On a Shoemaker. Crispianus with another would contend His trade, and Calling ne're should have an End 'Tis strange that Crispianus So will strive, For why without his Ends he canot live, Yet though he Waxeth poor it is confest His trade will holde unto the very Last, On Mistress Florella. Mistress Florella had a Plat of Land Intail'd to her so long as she did live, An honest fellow that did understand She would dispose it, ask'd what he should give, Florella understood the Fellow had, A Pole of Ground would fit her to a hair, Why Sir quoth she, I shall be very glad T'exchange, if that your evidence be fair, The woman shew'd a trial on record, And would join Issue with him if he please, The Fellow could not stand unto his word, And yet he found it was an o en Case, Your title's lame said she, you cannot seal, For you your self are Tenant but in Tail. On a Holy Sister. A holy Sister that did seldome erre, Walking abroad upon a Lecture-day, Did meet a very zealous Presbiter, Who sware to try her, e're he went away; Nay, fie, ah sad, ver'ly indeed forsooth, I would not do it, but to save your oath. On a Puny Scholler. A puny Schollar that had got degree, Would take a journey for his recreation, Into the Countrey, took the liberty To preach, his Text was in the Lamentations; The Fellow never from his Text did fall, For the whole work was Lamentable all. On Hunters. Hunters are men of a strange constitution, For most loue peace, they bawling and confusion; It is not possible Hunters can thrive, That make themselves such pris'ners while they live, For why, the Hunters doth himself confine Unto a cursed Kennell all his time, And in the end perchance Acteon's fate Falls on his head, and eates up his Estate. On Falconers. Falkners for whooping, hollowing, whisling, I Do think they be born mad, and so will die. Yet I confess it is a Noble fight; To set a Hawk to make a gallant flight, Were't not that in the end unhappily, The Hawk, and fortunes both away do fly. On a Poet. Should I forbear to write an Epigram Upon a Poet, this, or th'other man Might pick a quarrell, asking what are you That write these Epigrams, a Poet too, Peace Buzzard, peace for fear I do pronounce Another Epigram upon a Dunce, The worst that Blockheads dare to speak of it, Poets are (poor in person) rich in wit. The Unfortunate Lover. 1 I that Amorea loved, I who in her love delighted, I, poor I, am disapproved, I, and only I, am slighted. 2 I which in her love did glory, I am he that once was blessed, I can speak the saddest story I in Love have found expressed. 3 I that thought the time was wasted, I mispended from her presence, In sad farewell have tasted, I alas have lost my Essence. 4 I the Wretch whom Love hath smitten, I by love was ne're befriended, I that sometime Love have written, I have done for Love is ended. The Conclusion. Like to a Ship that now involv'd must be In th'Abiss of all profundity, When a Charibdiss sends a cruell Billow To intimate his thundring neighbur Seilla, To entertain the Wrack, or like a man That just before his death, sings with the Swan: So it is now with me; I Versefy, And Carroll out my dying Tragedy. 'Twas Amorea, it was only she, The sole effect of my lov'd destinie: 'Twas she alone that could the sentence give, And after judgement grant a sweet reprieve; 'Twas she at first, that stole my liberty, Making it captive, which was born free, 'Twas she that did command me for to prove, And write the best of passions, which is Love: 'Twas she that set my senses all at strife, 'Tis she that can, but will not save a life, 'Tis she my thoughts have put in a confusion, 'Tis she presented me with this conclusion, 'Twa she that scorned such a love as mine is, 'Tis she hath gi'n my Love and Book a FINIS. To his little Book. Goe little Book, let Amorea know What she doth owe Unto thy Authour, and her dying Swain Shew her disdain; No, stay and take thy errand, let her see 'Tis cruell she Hath brought her servant to a deep dispair, By being fair. But goe and do not fear to tell her, goe and show That lovely foe, By disoblieging him, and slighting thee, Both are set free; And if in reading thee, that killing Saint Doth once relent; Tell her it was her scornfull Tyrannie, Hath set an end unto my love and thee. On the Contents of his Book, to the Readers. I need no Index to my Book, for 'tis So little, that I'me sure you cannot miss; Yet 'cause 'tis usual, I will immitate The Major Poets: do not be angry at My bold presumption, if thou'rt such a one, My Book shall have Content, tho' thou hast none. ERATA. Besides the errours in each leafe, and line In every word, and every Character, The greatest errour I confess is mine In writing, for in silence none can erre, Wha er'e the Reader be I him Implore That shall vouchsafe to Read this little book Pardon the errours I will ask no more, Or pass them over with a candid look: And if thou hast not so much Charitie I care not for the Errours nor for thee.</field>
