      <field name="fulltext">THE AUTHOR UPON THE EMBLEM IN THE FRONTISPIECE This book containing EMBLEMS, 'twas thought fit A Title-page should stand to usher it, That's Emblematicall: And to that end, Our AUTHOR, to the Graver did commend A plain Invention; that it might be wrought, According as his Fancy had forethought Instead thereof, the Workman brought in light, What, here you see [illeg.] mistaking quite The true Delight: And so (with pains, and cost) The first intended FRONTISPIECE, is lost. The AUTHOR, was as much displeas'd, as He In such Adventures is inclin'd to be; And half resolv'd to cast this PIECE aside, As nothing worth: but having better ey'd Those Errors, and Confusions, which may there, Blame-worthy (at the first aspect) appear; He saw, they fitted many Fantasies Much better, then what Reason can devise; And that the Graver (by meer Chance) had hit On what, so much transcends the reach of Wit, As made it seem, an Object of Delight, To look on what MISFORTUNE brought to light: And here it stands, to try his Wit, who lists To pump the secrets, out of Cabalists. If any think this Page will now declare The meaning of those Figures, which are there, They are deceiv'd. For Destiny denies The utt'ring of such hidden Mysteries. In these respects: First, This containeth nought Which (in a proper sense) concerneth ought, The present-Age: Moreover, 'tis ordain'd That none must know the Secrecies contain'd Within this PIECE; but they who are so wise To find them out, by their own prudencies; And he that can unriddle them, to us, Shall stiled be, the second OEDIPUS. Tis likewise thought expedient, now and then, To make some Work, for those All-knowing men, (To exercise upon) who think they see The secret-meanings, of all things that be. And lastly, since we find, that some there are, Who best affect Inventions, which appear Beyond their understandings; This we knew A Representment, worthy of their view; And here we placed it, to be to these, A FRONTISPIECE, in any sense they please. Majesty in Misery; OR An Imploration to the King of Kings. Written by his late Majesty King Charles the First with his own hand, during his Captivity in Carisbrook Castle in the Isle of Wight. 1648. 1 Great Monarch of the World, from whose Power springs The Potency and Power of Kings, Record the Royal wo my suffering sings. 2 And teach my Tongue that ever did confine, Its faculties in truths Seraphick Line, To track the Treasons of thy Foes and mine. 3 Nature and Law by thy Divine Decree, The only Root of Righteous Royaltie, With this dim Diadem invested me. 4 With it, the sacred Scepter, Purple Robe, The Holy Unction, and the Royal Globe; Yet I am levelled with the life of Job. 5 The fiercest furies that do daily tread Upon my Grief, my Gray Discrowned Head, Are those that owe my Bounty, for their Bread. 6 They raise a War, and Christen it, The cause, Whilst Sacrilegious hands have best applause, Plunder and Murder are the Kingdoms Laws. 7 Tyranny bears the Title of Taxation, Revenge and Robbery are Reformation, Oppression gains the name of Sequestration. 8 My Loyal Subjects who in this bad season, Attend me (By the Law of God and Reason) They dare impeach and punish for High Treason. 9 Next at the Clergy do their Furies frown, Pious Episcopacy must go down, They will destroy the Crozier and the Crown. 10 Churchmen are chain'd, &amp; Schismaticks are freed Mechanicks preach, and Holy Fathers bleed, The Crown is Crucified with the Creed. 11 The Church of England doth all Faction foster, The Pulpit is usurpt by each Impostor, Extempore excludes the Pater noster. 12 The Presbyter and Independent seed, Springs with broad blades, to make Religion bleed, Herod and Pontius Pilate are agreed. 13 The Corner stone's misplac'd by every Pavier; With such a Bloody Method and Behaviour, Their Ancestors did crucify our Saviour. 14 My Royal Consort from whose fruitful womb, So many Princes Legally have come, Is forc'd in Pilgrimage to seek a Tomb, 15 Great Britains Heir is forced into France, Whilst on his Fathers head his Foes advance; Poor Child! he weeps out his Inheritance. 16 With my own Power my Majesty they wound, In the kings name the king himself's uncrown'd, So doth the dust destroy the Diamond. 17 With Propositions daily they Enchant, My Peoples ears, such as do Reason daunt, And the Almighty will not let me Grant. 18 They promise to erect my Royal stem, To make me Great, t'advance my Diadem, If I will first fall down and worship them. 19 But for refusal they devour my Thrones, Distress my Children, and destroy my Bones, I fear they'l force me to make Bread of Stones. 20 My life they prize at such a slender rate, And in my absence they draw Bills of hate, To prove the King a Traytor to the State. 21 Felons obtain more Priviledg than I, They are allow'd to answer ere they dye, 'Tis Death for me to ask the Reason, why. 22 But sacred Saviour, with thy words I woo Thee to forgive, and not be bitter to Such, as thou know'st, do not know what they do. 23 But since they from their Lord are so disjointed, As to contemn those Edicts he appointed. How can they prize the power of his Anointed? 24 Augment my Patience; Nullify my hate, Preserve my Issue, and Inspire my Mate. Yet, though we perish, Bless this Church and state Vota dabunt quæ Bella negarunt. The Explanation of the Emblem In Latin and English. In English. Though clogg'd with weights of Miseries, Palm-like Depress'd I higher rise. And as the unmoved Rock out-braves The boistrous Winds, and raging Waves; So Triumph I, and shine more bright In sad Afflictions Darksom night. That Splendid but yet Toilsom Crown, Regardlesly I trample down. With Joy I take this Crown of Thorn, Though Sharp, yet easy to be born. That Heavenly Crown already mine, I view with Eyes of Faith Divine. I slight vain things; and do imbrace, Glory the just reward of Grace. An Epitaph upon King Charles the first. So falls the stately Cedar, while it stood, That was the only Glory of the Wood. Great Charles, Terrestrial God, Celestial Man, Whose life, like others, though it were a span, Yet in that span was comprehended more, Than Earth hath waters, or the Ocean shore. Thy Heavenly Virtues Angels should reherse, It is a Theam too high for Human Verse. He that would know thee right then, let him look Upon thy rare Incomparable Book, And read it o're; and o're which if he do, He'l find thee King, and Priest, and Prophet too, And sadly see our loss, and though in vain, With fruitless wishes call thee back again. Nor shall oblivion sit upon thy Herse, Though there were neither Monument nor Verse. Thy Suff'rings and thy Death let no man name, It was thy Glory, but the Kingdoms shame. Another. Stay Passenger; behold and see, The widdow'd Grave of Majesty, Why tremblest not? here's that will make The most stupid, Soul to shake, Here lies intomb'd the sacred Dust. Of Peace and Piety, Right and Just. The blood (O start'st thou not to hear!) Of a blest King 'twixt hope and fear, Shed, and hurried hence to be The Miracle of Misery. The Lawgiver amongst his own, Sentenc'd by a Law unknown; Voted Monarchy to Death, By the course Plebeian breath The Soveraign of all Comma Suffering by a Common hand. A Prince (to make the Odium more) Martyr'd at his very door. The Head cut off! Oh, Death to see't, In Obedience to the Feet! And that by Justice you must know, If thou hast faith to think it so; We'll stir no further than this sacred clay, But let it slumber till the Judgment day. Of all the Kings on Earth, it's not deni'd, Here lies the first that for Religion dy'd. Another. Written by the Magnanimous James Marques of Montross with the point of his Sword. Great, Good, and Just could I but rate My Grief, and thy so rigid Fate. I'de weep the world to such a strain, That it should deluge once again. But since thy loud-tongu'd blood demands supplies More from Briareus hands then Argus Eyes; I'le sing thy Elegy with Trumpets sounds, And write thy Epitaph in Blood and Wounds, THE First Emblem Illustrated. As soon as we to Be begun, We did begin to be undone. When some, in former Ages, had a meaning An Emblem, of Mortality, to make, They form'd an Infant, on a Deaths-head leaning, And round about, encircled with a Snake: The Child so pictur'd, was to signify, That from our very Birth, our Dying springs: The Snake, her Tail devouring, doth imply The Revolution, of all Earthly things. For, whatsoever hath beginning, here, Begins, immediately, to vary from The same it was; and, doth at last appear What very few did think it should become. The solid Stone doth molder into Earth That Earth, e're long, to Water, rarifies; That Water gives an Airy Vapour birth, And, thence, a Fiery-Comet doth arise: That moves, untill it self it so impair, That from a burning-Meteor, back again, It sinketh down, and thickens into Air; That Air becomes a Cloud; then Drops of Rain Those Drops, descending on a Rocky Ground, There settle into Earth, which more and more Doth harden, still; so, running out the round, It grows to be the Stone it was before. Thus, All things wheel about; &amp; each Beginning Made entrance to its own Destruction hath. The Life of Nature entreth in with Sinning; And is, for ever, waited on by Death: The Life of Grace, is form'd by Death to Sin And, there, doth Life-eternal, straight begin. Lot 1. When thou hast changes good or bad, O'rejoy'd thou art, or oversad: As if it seemed very strange, To see the wind or Weather change. So therefore to remember thee How Changeable things Mortal be, Thou art assisted by this Lot, Now let it be no more forgot. THE Second Emblem Illustrated. When Vice and Virtue Youth shall wooe, 'Tis hard to say which way 'twill go. My hopeful Friends at thrice five years &amp; three Without a Guide (into the World alone) To seek my Fortune, did adventure mee; And, many hazards, I alighted on. First Englands greatest Rendevouz I sought, Where VICE and VERTUE at the highest sit; And, thither, both a Mind and Body brought, For neither of their Services unfit. Both, woo'd my Youth: And, both perswaded so, That (like the Young man in our Emblem here) I stood, and cry'd, Ah! which way shall I go? To me so pleasing both their Offers were. VICE Pleasures best Contentments promist me And what the wanton Flesh desires to have: Quoth VERTUE, I will Wisdom give to thee, And those brave things, w?? noblest Minds do crave Serve me said VICE and thou shalt soon acquire All hose Atchievements which my Service brings Serve me said VERTUE, and I'le raise thee higher Then VICES can, and teach thee better things. Whil'st thus they strove to gain me, I espyd Grim Death attending VICE; and, that her Face Was but a painted Vizard, which did hide The foul'st Deformity that ever was. LORD, grant me grace for evermore to view Her Ugliness: And, that I viewing it, Her Falsehoods and allurements may eschew; And on fair VERTUE my Affection set; Her Beauties contemplate, her Love embrace, And by her safe Direction, run my Race. Lot 2. With Mary thou art one of those, By whom the better part is chose: And though thou tempted art astray, Continu'st in a lawful way. Give God the praise with heart unfeign'd, That he such grace to thee hath deign'd. And rein thy Lot where thou shalt see, What hag hath laid a Trap for thee. THE Third Emblem. Illustrated. By knowledge only Life we gain, All other things to Death pertain How Fond are they, who spend their pretious Time, In still pursuing their deceiving Pleasures? And they, that unto airy Titles clime Or tire themselves in hording up of Treasures? For, these are Death's, who, when with weariness They have acquired most, sweeps all away; And leaves them, for their Labors, to possess Nought but a raw-bon'd Carcass lapt in clay. Of twenty hundred thousands, who this hour Vaunt much of those Possessions they have got; Of their new purchas'd Honours, or, the Power, By which they seem to have advanc't their Lot: Of this great Multitude, there shall not Three Remain, for any Future-age to know; But perish quite, and quite forgotten be, As Beasts, devoured twice ten years ago. Thou, therefore, who desir'st for ay to live, And to possess thy Labours maugre Death, To needful Arts and honest Actions, give Thy Span of Time, and thy short blast of Breath. In holy Studies, exercise thy Mind; In works of Charity, thy Hands imploy; That Knowledge, and that Treasure, seek to find, Which may enrich thy Heart with perfect Joy. So though obscured thou appear, a while, Despised, poor or born to Fortunes low, Thy Vertue shall acquire a nobler stile, Then greatest Kings are able to bestow: And, gain thee those Possessions, which, nor They, Nor Time, nor Death, have power to take away Lot 3. Thou dost overmuch respect, That which will thy harm effect. But some other things there be; Which will more advantage thee. Search thy heart and thou shalt there Soon discover what they are. Yea thine Emblem shews thee too What to shun, and what to do. THE Fourth Emblem Illustrated. As to the World I Naked came, So naked stript I leave the same. Thrice happy is that Man whose Thoughts do rear His Mind above that pitch the Worldling flies And by his Contemplations, hovers where He views things mortal, with unbleared eyes. What Trifles then do Villages and Towns Large Fields or Flocks of fruitful Cattle seem. Nay, what poor things are Miters, Scepters, Crowns, And all those Glories which men most esteem. Though he that hath among them, his Delight Brave things imagines them (because they blind With some false Lustre his beguiled sight) He that's above them, their mean-Worth may find. Lord, to that Blessed-Station me convey Where I may view the World, and view her so, That I her true Condition may survey; And all her Imperfections rightly know. Remember me, that once there was a Day, When thou didst wean me from them with content, Ev'n when shut up within those Gates I lay Through which the Plague-inflicting Angel went. And, let me still remember, that an Hour Is hourly coming on, wherein I shall (Though I had all the World within my power) Be naked stript, and turned out of all. But mind me, chiefly, that I never cleave Too closely to my Self; and cause thou me Not other Earthly things alone to leave, But to forsake my Self for love of Thee: That I may say, now I have all things left, Before that I of all things, am bereft. Lot 4. Be not angry if I tell, That you love the World too well, For this Lot, perhaps you drew; That such faults you might eschew. Mark to what their Souls aspire Who True Blessedness desire; For if you can do like those, Heaven you gain when Earth you lose. THE Fifth Emblem Illustrated. A Fool in Folly taketh Pain, Although he labour still in vain. A massie Mil-stone up a tedious Hill, With mighty Labour, Sisyphus doth roll; Which being rais'd aloft, down-tumbleth, still, To keep imployed his afflicted Soul. On him, this tedious Labour is impos'd; And (though in vain) it must be still assayd: But, some, by no Necessity inclos'd, Upon themselves, such needless Tasks have laid. Yea, knowing not (or caring not to know) That they are worn and weary'd out in vain, They madly toil to plung themselves in Wo; And, seek uncertain Ease, in certain Pain. Such Fools are they, who dream they can acquire A Mind content, by Lab'ring still for more: For, Wealth encreasing doth encrease Desire, And makes Contentment lesser then before. Such Fools are they, whose Hopes do vainly stretch To climb by Titles, to a happy Height: For, having gotten one Ambitious-Reach, Another comes perpetually in sight. And, their stupidity is nothing less, Who dream that Flesh and Blood may raised be Up to the Mount of perfect Holiness: For (at our best) corrupt and vile are we. Yet, we are bound by Faith, with Love, and Hope, To roll the Stone of Good Endeavour, still, As near as may be, to Perfections top, Though back again it tumble down the Hill. So; What Our Works had never power to do, God's Grace, at last, shall freely bring us to, Lot 5. M. Doubtless thou art either wooing, Or some other business doing, Which you shall attempt in vain, Or much hazard all your pain. Yet if good your meanings are, Do not honest means forbear. For where things are well begun, God oft works when man hath done. THE Sixth Emblem Illustrated. His Pace must wary be and slow, That hath a slippery way to go. A travailer, when he must undertake To seek his passage, o're some Frozen Lake, With leisure, and with care, he will assay The glassy smoothness of that Icy-way, Lest he may slip, by walking over-fast; Or, break the crackling Pavement, by his hast: And, so (for want of better taking heed) Incur the mischiefs of Unwary-speed. We are all Travellers; and, all of us Have many passages, as dangerous, As Frozen-lakes, and Slipery-ways, we tread, In which our lives may soon be forfeited, (With all our hopes of Life-Eternal, too) Unless, we well consider what we do. There is no private Way or publick Path But rubs, or holes, or slipp'riness it hath, Whereby, we shall with Mischiefs meet; unless We walk it, with a stedfast-wariness. The steps to Honour, are on Pinacles Compos'd of melting Snow, and Isicles; And, they who tread not nicely on their tops, Shall on a suddain slip from all their hopes. Yea, ev'n that way which is both sure and holy, And leads the mind from Vanities and Folly, Is with so many other Path-ways crost, As that, by Rashness, it may soon be lost; Unless, we well deliberate, upon Those Tracts, in which our Ancestours have gone: And, they who with more haste, then heed, will run, May lose the way, in which they well begun. Lot. 6. In slippery Paths you are to go, yea, they are full of danger too. And if you heedful should not grow they'l hazard much your overthrow. But you the mischief may eschew, If wholsom Counsel you pursue; Look therefore, what you may be taught, By that, which this your chance hath brought. THE Seventh Emblem Illustrated. Our Pelican by bleeding thus, Fulfill'd the Law, and cured us. Look here, and mark (her sickly birds to feed) How freely this kind Pelican doth bleed. See, how (when other Salves could not be found) To cure their sorrows, she her self doth wound; And when this holy Emblem thou shalt see, Lift up thy soul to him, who dy'd for thee. For this our Hieroglyphick would express That Pelican, which in the Wilderness Of this vast World, was left (as all alone) Our miserable Nature to bemone; And in whose eyes, the tears of pity stood, When he beheld his own unthankful Brood His Favours and his Mercies, then contemn, When with his wings he would have brooded them: And sought their endless peace to have confirm'd, Though to procure his ruine, they were arm'd. To be their Food, himself he freely gave; His Heart was pierc'd, that he their Souls might save. Because, they disobey'd the Sacred-will, He did the Law of Righteousness fulfill; And to that end (though guiltless he had bin) Was offered, for our Universal-sin. Let me, Oh God! for ever fix mine eyes Upon the Merit of that Sacrifice: Let me retain a due commemoration Of those dear Mercies, and that bloody Passion, Which here is meant; and by true Faith, still feed Upon the drops, this Pelican did bleed; Yea, let me firm unto thy Law abide, And ever love that Flock, for which he dy'd. Lot 7. This present Lot concerns full near, Not you alone but all men here. For all of us too little heed; His Love who for our sakes did bleed. 'Tis true, that means he left behind him which better teacheth how to mind him. Yet if we both by that, and this, Remember him, 'tis not amiss. THE Eighth Emblem Illustrated. Though he endeavour all he can, An Ape will never be a man. What though an Apish-Pigmy, in attire, His Dwarfish Body Gyant-like, array? Turn Brave, &amp; get him Stilts to seem the higher? What would so doing, handsome him I pray? Now, surely, such a Mimick sight as that, Would with excessive Laughter move your Spleen, Till you had made the little Dandiprat, To lye within some Auger-hole, unseen. I must confess I cannot chuse but smile, When I perceive, how Men that worthless are, Piece out their Imperfections, to beguile, By making shows, of what they never were. For, in their borrow'd-Shapes, I know those Men, And (through their Masks) such insight of them have; That I can oftentimes disclose (ev'n then) How much they savour of the Fool or Knave. A Pigmey-spirit, and an Earthly-Mind, Whose look is only fixt on Objects vain; In my esteem, so mean a place doth find, That ev'ry such a one, I much refrain. But, when in honour'd Robes I see it put, Betrimm'd, as if some thing of Worth it were, Look big, and on the Stilts of Greatness, strut From scorning it, I cannot then forbear. For, when to gross Unworthiness Men add Those Dues, which to the Truest-worth pertain; Tis like an Ape, in Humane Vestments clad, Which, when most fine, deserveth most disdain: And more absurd, those Men appear to me, Then this Fantastick-Monkey seems to thee. Lot 8. M. Thy chance is doubtful and as yet, I know not what to make of it. But this I know a Foe thou art; To what thine Emblem, hath in part, Expressed by a Mimick Shape; Or thou thy self art such an ape. Now which of these pertains to thee, Let them that know the Judges be. THE Ninth Emblem Illustrated. Poor Thieves in Fetters we behold, And Great Thieves in their Chains of Gold. If you this Emblem, well have look'd upon, Although you cannot help it, yet, bemone The Worlds black Impudence; and if you can Continue (or become) an honest man. The poor, and petty Pilferers, you see On Wheels, on Gibbets, and the Gallow tree Trust up; when they that far more guilty are, Pearl, Silk, and costly Cloth of Tissue, wear. Good God! how many hath each Land of those Who neither limb, nor life, nor credit lose, (But, rather live befriended, and applauded) Yet, have of all their livelihoods defrauded The helpless Widows, in their great distress? And of their Portions rob'd the Fatherless? Yet, censur'd other's Errours, as if none Had cause to say, that they amiss have done? How many, have assisted to condemn Poor souls, for what was never stoln by them? And persecuted others, for that Sin, Which they themselves, had more transgressed in? How many worthless men, are great become, By that, which they have stoln, or cheated from Their Lords? or (by some practices unjust) From those, by whom they had been put in trust? How many Lawyers, wealthy men are grown, By taking Fees for Causes overthrown By their defaults? How many, without fear, Do rob the King, and God, yet blameless are? God knows how many! would I did so, too, So I had pow'r to make them better do. Lot 9. We hope no Person here believes, That you are of those wealthy Thieves. Who Chains of Gold and Pearl do wear; And of those Thieves that none you are, Which wear a Rope we plainly see, For you as yet unhanged be. But unto God for Mercy cry; Else hang'd you may be e're you die. THE Tenth Emblem. Illustrated. We then have got the surest Prop, When Heaven alone becomes our hope. I should not care how hard my Fortunes were, Might still my Hopes be such, as now they are, Of helps divine; nor fear, how poor I be, If thoughts, yet present, still may bide in me. For, they have left assurance of such aid, That, I am of no dangers, now afraid. Yea, now I see, methinks, what weak and vain Supporters I have sought, to help, sustain My fainting heart; when some injurious hand, Would undermine the Station where I stand. Methinks, I see how scurvy, and how base, It is to scrap for favours, and for grace, To men of earthly minds; and unto those, Who may, perhaps, before to morrow lose Their wealth, (or their abus'd Authority) And stand as much in want of help as I. Me thinks, in this New-rapture I do see The hand of God from heaven supporting me, Without those rotten-Aids, for which I whin'd, When I was of my tother vulgar-mind: And if in some one part of me it lay, I'now, could cut that Limb of mine away. Still might I keep this mind, there were enough Within my self, (beside that cumbring stuff We seek without) which, husbanded aright, Would make me Rich, in all the worlds despight. And I have hopes, that had she quite bereft me, Of those few raggs and toys, which yet are left me; I should on God, alone, so much depend, That, I should need, nor Wealth, nor other Friend. Lot 10. Because her Aid makes goodly shows, You on the world your Trust repose; And his dependance you despise, Who clearly on Heavens help relies. That therefore you may come to see, How pleas'd and safe those men may be. Who have no Aid but God alone; This Emblem you have lighted on. THE Eleventh Emblem Illustrated. Do not the Golden Mean exceed In word, in Passion, nor in deed. As is the head-strong Horse, and blockish Mule, Ev'n such, without the Bridle, and the Rule, Our Nature grows; and is as mischievous, Till Grace and Reason, come to govern us. The Square, and Bridle, therefore let us heed, And thereby learn to know, what helps we need; Left, else, (they failing, timely, to be had) Quite out of Order, we at length, be made. The Square, (which is an useful Instrument, To shape for senseless Forms) may represent The Law: Because Mankind, (which is by Nature Almost as dull, as is the senseless-creature,) Is thereby, from the native-rudeness, wrought; And in the Way of honest-living taught. The Bridle, (which Invention did contrive, To rule, and guide the Creature-sensitive) May type forth Discipline; which when the Law Hath school'd the Wit, must keep the Will in awe. And he that can by these, his Passions bound, This Emblems meaning, usefully, hath found. Lord, let thy sacred Law, at all times, be A rule a Master, and a Glass to me; (A Bridle, and a Light) that I may, still, Both know my Duty, and obey thy Will. Direct my Feet; my Hands instruct thou so, That I may neither wander, nor mis-do. My Looks, my Hearing, and my Words confine, To keep still firm, to ev'ry Word of thine. On thee, let also my Desires attend, And let me hold this Temper, till mine end. Lot 11. Your wits, your wishes, and your Tongue Have run the wild-Goose chase too long. And (lest all Reason you exceed) You now of Rule, and Reins have need. A Bridle therefore and a square, Chief Figures in your Emblem are. Observe their Moral, and alway, Be wise and sober as you may. THE Twelfth Emblem Illustrated. My wit got wings, and high had flown, But Poverty did keep me down. You little think, what plague it is to be, In plight like him, whom pictur'd here you see. His winged-Arm, and his up lifted-eyes, Declare, that he hath Wit, and Will, to rise: The Stone, which clogs his other hand, may show That Poverty and Fortune, keep him low: And 'twixt these two, the Body and the Mind, Such labours, and such great vexations find, That, if you did not such mens wants contemn, You could not chuse but help, or pity them. All Ages had (and this I know hath some) Such men as to this misery, do come: And many of them, at their Lot, so grieve, As if they knew, (or did at least believe) That, had their Wealth suffic'd them to aspire (To what their Wits deserve, and they desire) The present Age, and future Ages too, Might gain have had, from what they thought to do. Perhaps I dream'd so once: But, God be prais'd, The Clog which kept me down, from being rais'd, Was chain'd so fast, that (if such Dreams I had) My thoughts, and longings, are not now so mad For, plain I see, that had my Fortunes brought Such Wealth, at first, as my small Wit hath sought, I might my self, and others, have undone; Instead of Courses, which I thought to run: I find my Poverty, for me was fit; Yea, and a Blessing, greater than my Wit: And whether, now I rich or poor become, Tis nor much pleasing, nor much troublesome. Lot 12. Thou think'st thy wit had made thee Great, Had Poverty not been some lot. But had thy wealth as ample been, As thou didst think thy wit so fine; Instead of thy desired hight, Perhaps thou hadst been ruin'd quite. Hereafter therefore be content, With whatsoever Heaven hath sent. THE Thirteenth Emblem Illustrated. The best good turns that Fools can do us. Prove disadvantages unto us. A fool, sent forth to fetch the Goslings home, When they unto a Rivers brink were come, (Through which their passage lay) conceiv'd a fear, His Dames best Brood might have been drown'd there; Which, to avoid, he thus did shew his wit, And his good nature, in preventing it. He, underneath his girdle, thrusts their heads, And then the Coxcomb through the water wades. Here learn, that when a Fool his help intend It rather doth a mischief, then befriends; And think, if there be danger in his love, How harmful his Maliciousness may prove: For, from his kindness, though no profit rise, To do thee spight, his Malice may suffice. I could not from a Prince beseech a boon By suing to his Jester or Buffoon: Nor any Fools vain humor sooth or serve, To get my bread, though I were like to starve For to be poor, I should not blush so much, As if a Fool should raise me to be rich. Lord, though of such a kind my faults may be That sharp Affliction still must tutor me, (And give me due Correction in her Schools) Yet, oh preserve me from the scorn of Fools. Those wicked Fools, that in their hearts have said There is no God; and rather give me Bread By Ravens, LORD, or in a Lions Den, Then by the Favours of such foolish men: Lest, if their dainties I should swallow down, Their smile might more undo, me then their frown. Lot 13. Thou dost not greatly care by whom Thy wealth, or thy Preferments come, To thou may'st get them, Fool or knave, Thy Prayers, and thy Praise may have. Because thou dost not fear or dream What disadvantage comes by them; But by thine Emblem, thou may'st see, Fools favours mischievous may be. THE Fourteenth Emblem Illustrated. Behold and mark the Picture here, Of what keeps Man and Child in fear. These are the greatest Afflictions, most men have, Ev'n from their Nursing-cradle to their Grave: Yet, both so needful are, I cannot see, How either of them, may well spared be. The Rod is that, which most our Childhood fears; And seems the great'st Affliction that it bears: That, which to Man-hood, is a plague, as common (And more unsufferable) is a Woman. Yet, blush not Ladies; neither frown, I pray, That thus of Women I presume to say; Nor number me, as yet, among your foes; For, I am more your friend, then you suppose Nor smile ye Men, as if, from hence, ye had An Argument, that Woman-kind were bad. The Birch, is blameless (yea, by nature, sweet, And gentle) till, with stubborn Boys, it meet But, then it smarts. So, Women, will be kind, Until, with froward Husbands, they are joyn'd: And then indeed (perhaps) like Birchen boughs, (Which, else, had been a trimming, to their House) They sometimes prove, sharp whips, and Rods, to them, That Wisdom, and Instruction do contemn. A Woman, was not given for Correction; But, rather for a furtherance to Perfection: A precious Balm of love, to cure Mans grief; And of his Pleasures, to become the chief. If, therefore, she occasion any smart, The blame, he merits, wholly, or in part: For, like sweet Honey, she good Stomacks, pleases; But pains the Body, subject to Diseases. Lot 14. M. The time hath been that of the Rod Thou wert more fearful then of God. But now unless thou prudent grow, More cause thou hast to fear a Shrow. For from the Rod now thou art free, A Woman shall thy Torment be. Yet do not thou at her repine; For all the Fault is only thine. THE Fifteenth Emblem Illustrated. Where many Forces joyned are, Unconquerable Power is there. An Emblem's meaning, here, I thought to conster; And this doth rather fashion out a Monster, Then form an Hieroglyphick: but, I had These Figures (as you see them) ready made By others; and I mean to morallize Their Fancies; not to mend what they devise, Yet, peradventure with some vulgar praise, This Picture (though I like it not) displays The Moral, which the Motto doth imply; And thus it may be said to signifie. He, that hath many Faculties, or Friends, To keep him safe (or to acquire his ends) And fits them so; and keeps them so together, That, still, as readily, they aid each other, As if so many Hands, they had been made; And in One-body, useful being had: That man, by their Assistance, may, at length, Attain to an unconquerable strength; And crown his honest Hopes, with whatsoever He seeks for, by a warranted Endeavour. Or, else, it might be said; that, when we may Make our Affections, and our Sense, obey The will of Reason, (and so well agree, That we may find them, still at peace to be) They'l guard us, like so many Armed bands; And safely keep us, whatsoever withstands. If others think this Figure, here, infers A better sense; let those Interpreters Unriddle it; and preach it where they please: Their Meanings may be good, and so are these. Lot 15. If all your Powers you should unite In your desires prevail you might; And sooner should effect your ends If you should muster up your friends. But since your best friends do suspect, That you such Policy neglect. Your Lot presenteth to your view An Emblem which instructeth you. THE Sixteenth Emblem Illustrated. A Fickle Woman wanton grown, Prefers a Fiddle before a Crown. Fool! Dost thou hope, thine Honours, or thy Gold, Shall gain thee Love? Or, that thou hast her heart, Whose hand upon thy tempting Bait laies hold? Alas! fond Lover, thou deceived art. She that with Wealth, and Titles, can be won, Or woo'd with Vanities, will wav'ring be; And when her Love, thou most dependest on, A Fiddle-stick shall win her heart from thee. To Youth and Musick, Venus leaneth most; And (though her hand she on the Scepter lay) Let Greatness of her Favours never boast: For, Heart and Eye are bent another way. And lo, no glorious Purchase that Man gets, Who hath with such poor Trifles, woo'd, &amp; won: Her footing, on a Ball, his Mistress sets, Which in a moment slips, and she is gone. A Woman, meerly with an Out-side caught; Or tempted with a Galliard or a Song, Will him forsake (whom she most lovely thought) For Players and for Tumblers, ere't be long. You, then that wish your Love should ever last, (And would enjoy Affection without changing) Love where your Loves may worthily be plac't; And keep your own Affection, still from ranging. Use noble means, your Longings to attain; Seek equall Minds, and well beseeming Years: They are (at best) vain Fools, whom Folly gain; But; there is Bliss, where Vertue most endears: And wheresoe'r, Affection she procures, In spight of all Temptations, it endures. Lot 16. M. If some here present this had got, They would have blushed at their Lot, Since very fit the same doth prove, For one unconstant in his Love. Or one that has a frickle Mate; If you enjoy a better state, Yet hearken what your Lot doth say, Lest you hereafter want it may, THE Seventeenth Emblem Illustrated. Though Fortune prove true Virtues Foe, It cannot work her overthrow. Unhappy men are they, whose Ignorance So slaves them to the Fortunes of the Time, That they (attending on the Lot of Chance) Neglect by Vertue, and Deserts, to clime. Poor Heights they be which Fortune rears unto; And fickle is the Favour she bestows: To-day, she makes; to morrow doth undoe; Builds up, and in an instant overthrows. On easie Wheels, to Wealth and Honours high, She winds men oft, before they be aware; And when they dream of most Prosperity, Down, headlong, throws them lower then they were. You, then, that seek a more assur'd estate, On good, and honest Objects, fix your Mind, And follow Vertue, that you may a Fate Exempt from fear of Change, or Dangers, find. For, he that's Vertuous, whether high or low His Fortune seeems (or whether foul or fair His Path he finds) or whether friend or foe, The World doth prove; regards it not a hair. His Loss is Gain; his Poverty is Wealth; The Worlds Contempt, he makes his Diadem; In Sickness, he rejoyceth, as in Health; Yea, Death it self becometh Life, to him. He fears no disrespect, no bitter scorn, Nor subtile plottings, nor Oppressions force; Nay, though the World should topsie-turvie turn It cannot fright him, nor divert his Course. Above all Earthly powers his Vertue rears him, And up with Eglets wings, to Heav'n it bears him. Lot 17. M. This Man whatever he may seem, Is worthy of an high esteem. Though Fortune may his Person grind, She cannot yet disturb his mind. Yea blest and happy should we be, Were all of us but such as he. Read but his Motto which you drew, For that in part the same will shew. THE Eighteenth Emblem Illustrated. Above thy Knowledge do not rise. But with Sobriety be wise. Exalt thou not thy self, though plac'd thou be, Upon the top of that old Olive-tree, From whence the nat'rall branches prun'd have bin, That, thou, the better, mightst be grafted in. Be not so over-wise, as to presume The Gard'ner, for thy goodness, did assume Thy small Crab Olive, to insert it there, Where, once, the sweetest-berries growing were. Nor let thy Pride those few old-boughs contemn Which, yet, remain upon their ancient Stem; Because, thy new-incorporated Sprayes, Do more enjoy the Suns refreshing raies: But humbled rather and more awful be; Left he that cut off them do break down thee, Be wise, in what may to thy good belong; But, seek not Knowledge, to thy neighbours wrong: Be thankful for the Grace thou hast receiv'd, But, judge not those, who seem thereof bereav'd; Nor into those forbidden secrets peep. Which God-Almighty, to himself doth keep. Remember what our Father Adam found, When he for Knowledge, sought beyond his bound. For doubtless, ever since, both good and ill Are left with Knowledge, intermingled still; And (if we be not humble, meek, and wary) We are in daily danger to miscarry. Large proves the fruit which on the Earth doth lie; Winds break the twig, that's grafted over-high; And he that will, beyond his bounds, be wise, Becomes a very Fool, before he dies. Lot 18. This Lot those Persons always finds, That have high Thoughts, and lofty minds: Or such as have an itch to learn, That which doth nothing them concern. Or love to peep with daring eyes, Into forbidden Mysteries. If any one of these thou be; Thine Emblem better teacheth thee. THE Nineteenth Emblem Illustrated. When each man keeps unto his Trade, Then all things better will be made. We more should thrive, and err the seldomer, If we were like this honest Carpenter, Whose Emblem, in reproof of those, is made, That love to meddle farther then their Trade. But, most are now exceeding cunning grown In ev'ry mans affairs, except their own: Yea, Coblers think themselves not only able, To censure; but, to mend Apelles Table. Great-men, sometime, will gravely undertake To teach, how Brooms &amp; Morter, we should make. Their Indiscretions, Peasants imitate, And boldly meddle with affairs of State. Some Houswives teach their Teachers how to pray, Some Clarks have shew'd themselves, as wise as they; And in their Callings, as discreet have bin, As if they taught their Grandames how to spin: And if these Customs last a few more Ages, All Countries will be nothing else, but Stages Of evil-acted, and mistaken parts; Or, Gallemaufries of imperfect Arts. But, I my self (you'l say) have medlings made In things, that are improper to my Trade. No; for, the MUSES are in all things free; Fit subject of their Verse, all Creatures be; And there is nothing nam'd so mean, or great, Whereof they have not liberty to treat. Both Earth and Heav'n, are open unto these, And (when to take more liberty they please) They Worlds, and things, create, which never were; And when they list they play, and meddle there. Lot 19. If all be true these Lots do tell us, Thou shouldest be of those prating Fellows, Who better practised are grown, In others matters then their own. Or one that covets to be thought A man that is ignorant of nought. If it be so, thy Moral shews Thy folly, and from whence it flows. THE Twentieth Emblem Illustrated. They after suffering shall be crown'd, In whom a Constant Faith is found. Mark well this Emblem; and observe you thence The nature of true Christian-confidence. Her Foot is fixed on a squared-Stone, Which, whether side soe're you turn it on, Stands fast; and is that Corner-stone, which props, And firmly knits the structure of our Hopes. She, always, bears a Cross; to signifie, That there was never any Constancy Without her Tryals: and that, her perfection Shall never be attain'd, without Affliction. A Cup she hath moreover in her hand; And by that Figure, thou mayst understand, That she hath draughts of Comfort, always near her, (At ev'ry brunt) to strengthen, and to cheer her. And loe, her head is crown'd; that, we may see How great, her Glories, and Rewards, will be. Hereby, this Vertue's nature may be known: Now, practise how to make the same thine own. Discourag'd be not though thou art pursu'd With many wrongs; which cannot be eschew'd, Nor yield thou to Despairing, though thou hast A Cross (which threatens death) to be embrac't; Or, though thou be compell'd to swallow up, The very dregs, of Sorrows bitter Cup: For, whensoever griefs, or torments, pain thee, Thou hast the same Foundation to sustain thee: The self same Cup of Comfort, is prepar'd, To give thee strength, when fainting fits are feard. And when thy time of trial, is expired, Thou shalt obtain the Crown, thou hast desired. Lot. 20. Thy Fortunes have been very bad, For many Sufferings thou hast had; And Tryals too, which are unknown, To any but thy self alone. Yet not loss, nor harm nor smart, From Constant hopes remove thy heart. For see thine Emblem doth foreshew; A good Conclusion will ensue. THE 21st Emblem Illustrated. Who Patience tempt beyond its strength, Will turn't to Fury at the length. Although we know not a more patient creature Than is the Lamb, (or, of less harmfull nature) Yet, as this Emblem shews, when childish wrong Hath troubled, and provok'd him overlong, He grows enrag'd; and makes the wanton Boys Be glad to leave their sports, and run their ways. Thus have I seen it with some Children fare, Who, when their Parents too indulgent were, Have urg'd them, till their Doting grew to Rage, And shut them wholly from their Heritage. Thus, many times, a foolish man doth lose His faithfull Friends, and justly makes them foes. Thus, froward Husbands, and thus, peevish Wives, Do fool away the comfort of their lives; And by abusing of a patient-mate, Turn dearest Love, into the deadliest Hate: For, any wrong may better be excused, Than Kindness, long, and wilfully abused. But, as an injur'd Lamb, provoked, thus, Well typifies how much it moveth us, To find our Patience wrong'd: So, let us make An Emblem of our selves, thereby to take More heed, how God is moved towards them, That, his long-suffering, and his Love contemn. For, as we somewhat have of every creature, So, we in us, have somewhat of his Nature: Or, if it be not said the same to be, His Pictures, and his Images are we. Let, therefore, his long-suffering well be weigh'd, And keep us, to provoke him, still afraid. Lot 21. Thou hast provoked overlong; Their Patience who neglect the wrong; And thou dost little seem to heed, what hurt it threats if thou proceed. To thee thy Emblem therefore shows, To what abused Patience grows. Observe it well, and make thy Peace, Before to fury wrath increase. THE 22d Emblem Illustrated. Our days, until our Life hath end, In Labour and in Hopes we spend. As soon as our first Parents disobey'd, Forthwith a Curse, for their offence, was laid, Inforcing them, and their succeeding race, To get their Food, with sweatings of the Face. But afterward, this Doom to mitigate, (And ease the miseries of their estate) God gave them Hope, that she might help them bear The burthens of their Travail, and their care. A Woman with an Anchor, and a Spade, An Emblem of that Mystery is made: And this Estate, we all continue in, By God's free Mercy, and our proper Sin. By Sin, the Labour is on us intail'd; By Grace, it is, that Hoping hath not fail'd; And if in Hope, our Labours we attend, That Curse will prove a Blessing, in the end, My Lot is Hope and Labour; and between These Two, my Life-time hath prolonged been: Yet hitherto, the best of all my Pain With most of all my Hopes have been in vain; And to the World-ward, I am like to wast My time in fruitless labours, till the last. However, I have still my Hopes as fair As he that hath no temptings to Despair; And change I will not, my last houers for theirs, Whose Fortune, more desirable appears; Nor cease to Hope and Labour, though of most, My Hope and Labour be adjudged lost: For, though I lose the shadow of my Pains, The substance of it, still in God remains. Lot 22. In secret thou dost oft complain, That thou hast hop'd and wrought in vain. And think'st thy Lot, is far more hard, Than what for others is prepar'd. An Emblem therefore thou hast got, Which shews, it is our Common Lot, To Work and hope, and that thou hast A Blessing by it at the last. THE 23d Emblem Illustrated. To Learning I a love should have, Although one Foot were in the Grave. Here, we an Aged man described have, That hath one foot, already, in the Grave: And if you mark it (though the Sun decline, And horned Cynthia doth begin to shine) With open book, and with attentive eyes, Himself, to compass Knowledge, he applies: And though that Evening end his last of days, Yet, I will study, more to learn, he says. From this, we gather, that, while time doth last, The time of learning, never will be past; And that, each hour till we our life lay down, Still something, touching life is to be known, When he was old, wise Cato learned Greek: But, we have aged-folks, that are to seek Of that, which they have much more cause to learn Yet, no such mind in them we shall discern. For that, which they should study in their prime, Is, oft, deferred till their latter-time: And then, old-age, unfit for learning, makes them, Or, else, that common dulness overtakes them, Which makes ashamed, that it should be thought, They need, like little-children, to be taught. And so, out of this world, they do return As wise, as in that week, when they were born. God, grant me grace, to spend my life-time so, That I my duty still may seek to know; And that, I never, may so far proceed, To think, that I more Knowledge do not need: But, in Experience, may continue growing, Till I am fill'd with fruits of pious-knowing. Lot 23. By this your Emblem we discern, That you are yet of Age to learn. And that when elder you shall grow, There will be more for you to know. Presume not therefore of your wit; But strive that you may better it, For of your Age we many view, That far more wisdom have then you. THE 24th Emblem Illustrated. Where e're we are the Heavens are near, Let us but fly and we are there. Why, with a trembling faintness, should we fear The face of Death? and fondly linger here, As if we thought the Voyage to be gone Lay through the shades of Styx or Acheron? Or, that we either were to travel down To uncouth Depths, or up some heights unknown? Or, to some place remote, whose nearest end Is farther then Earths limits do extend? It is not by one half that distance, thither Where Death lets in, as it is any whither: No not by half so far, as to your bed; Or, to that place, where you should rest your head, If on the ground you laid your self (ev'n there) Where at this moment you abiding are. This Emblem shews (if well you look thereon) That, from your Glass of life, which is to run, There's but one step to Death; and that you tread At once, among the Living, and the Dead. In whatsoever Land, we live or die, God is the same; And Heav'n is there as nigh As in that place, wherein we most desire Our Souls, with our last breathing, to expire. Which things, well heeding; let us not delay Our Journey, when we summon'd are away, (As those inforced Pilgrims use to do, That know not whither, nor, how far they go) Nor let us dream that we in Time or Place, Are far from ending our uncertain Race. But, let us fix on Heav'n, a faithful eye, And still, be flying thither, till we die. Lot 24. To your Long-Home you nearer are, Than you it may be are aware. Yea and more easy is the way, Then you perhaps conceive it may. Lest therefore death should grim appear, And put you in a causeless fear. Or out of minding wholly pass, This Chance to you allotted was. THE Twenty fifth Emblem Illustrated. A Sieve of Shelter maketh show, But every Storm will through it go. Some Men, when for their Actions they procure A likely colour, (be it ne're so vain) Proceed as if their Projects were as sure, As when Sound Reason did their Course maintain: And these not much unlike those Children are, Who through a Storm advent'ring desp'rately, Had rather on their Heads a Sive to bear, Then Cov'rings, that may serve to keep them dry. For, at a distance that perchance is thought A helpfull Shelter; and yet, proves to those Who need the same a Toy, which profits nought; Because, each drop of Rain quite through it, goes So they, whose foolish Projects, for a while, Do promise their Projectors hopefull ends, Shall find them, in the Tryal, to beguile; And that both Shame and Want on them attends. Such like is their estate who, (to appear Rich men to others) do, with inward-pain, A gladsome out-ward Port desire to bear; Though they at last nor Wealth nor Credit gain. And such are all those Hypocrites, who strive False Hearts beneath Fair spoken Words to hide: For, they o'revail themselves but with a Sive, Through which, their purposes at length are spied. And then, they either wofully lament Their Brutish-folly, or so hardened grow In Sinning, that they never can repent, Nay, jest and scoff at their own Overthrow. But no false Vail can serve (when God will smite) To save a Scorner, or an Hypocrite. Lot 25. Take heed you do not quite forget, That you are dancing in a Net. Many there are your Ways do see, Although you think unseen you be. Your Faults we will no nearer touch, Methinks your Emblem blabs too much, But if you mend what is amiss, You shall be ne're the worse for this. THE Twenty sixth Emblem Illustrated. He that enjoys a quiet mind, Can pleasure in Affliction find. What means this Country peasant, skipping here Through prickling Thistles with such joyful cheer? And plucking off their tops, as though for Posies He gather'd Violets, or toothless Roses? What meaneth it, but only to express How great a joy, well grounded Patientness Retains in Suff'rings? and what sport she makes, When she her Journey through Affliction takes? I oft have said (and have as oft been thought To speak a Paradox, that favours nought Of likely truth) that some Afflictions bring A Honey bag, which cureth ev'ry Sting, (That wounds the Flesh) by giving to the Mind, A pleasing taste of Sweetnesses refin'd. Nor can it other be, except in those, Whose Better part, quiet stupifyed grows, By being cauterized in the Fires Of childish Fears, or temporal Desires. For, as the Valiant (when the Coward swounds) With gladness lets the Surgeon search his Wounds; And though they smart, yet cheerfully indures The Plaisters, and the Probe, in hope of Cures: So, Men, assured that Afflictions pain Comes not for vengeance to them, nor in vain; But, to prepare, and fit them for the place, To which, they willingly direct their pace; In troubles, are so far from being sad, That, of their Suffering, they are truly glad. What ever others think, I thus believe; And therefore, joy, when they suppose I grieve. Lot 26. At your Afflictions you repine, And in all troubles cry and whine. As if to suffer, brought no Joy, But quite did all content destroy. That you may therefore Patient grow, And learn this Virtues power to know This Lot unto your view is brought, Peruse and Practise what is taught. THE Twenty seventh Emblem Illustrated. Deformity within may be, where outward Beauty we do see. Look well, I pray, upon this Beldam, here, For, in her habit, though she gay appear, You, through her youthful vizard, may espy She's of an old Edition, by her Eye: And by her wainscot face, it may be seen, She might your Grandams first dry nurse have been. This is an Emblem, fitly shaddowing those, Who making fair, and honest outward shows, Are inwardly deform'd; and nothing such, As they to be suppos'd, have strived much. They chuse their words, and play well-acted parts But hide most loathsome projects in their hearts And when you think sweet Friendship to embrace, Some ugly Treason meets you in the face. I hate a bainted Brow; I much dislike A maiden-blush, dawb'd on a furrowed Cheek: And I abhor to see old Wantons play, And suit themselves, like Ladies of the May. But more (yea, most of all) my soul despiseth A Heart, that in Religious forms disguiseth Prophane intentions; and arays in white The coal-black conscience of an Hypocrite. Take heed of such as these; and (if you may) Before you trust them, tract them in their way. Observe their footsteps, in their private path: For these (as 'tis believ'd, the Devil hath) Have cloven feet; that is, two ways they go; One for their ends, and tother for a show. Now, you thus warned are, advice embrace; And trust nor gawdy Clothes, nor painted Face. Lot 27. Fine Clothes, fair words, inticing Face, With Masks of Piety and Grace, Oft cheat you with an outward show, Of that which proveth nothing so. Therefore your Emblems Moral read, And ere too far you do proceed. Think whom you deal withal to day, Who by fair Shews deceive you may. THE Twenty eighth Emblem Illustrated. When wicked Men confined are, They revel who were kept in fear. A tyrannous, or wicked Magistrat, Is fitly represented by a Cat: For, though the Mice, a harmfull vermine be, And Cats the remedy; yet, oft we see, That, by the Mice, far less, some house-wives leese, Then when they set the Cat to keep the Cheese. A ravenous Cat, will punish in the Mouse, The very same Offences, in the house, Which he himself commits; yea, for that Vice, Which was his own (with praise) he kills the Mice And spoileth not anothers life alone, Ev'n for that very fault which was his own, But feeds, and fattens, in the spoil of them, Whom he, without compassion, did condemn. Nay worse than so; he cannot be content, To slaughter them, who are as innocent, As he himself; but, he must also play, And sport his woful Pris'ners lives away; More torturing them, 'twixt fruitless hopes and fears, Than when their bowels, with his teeth he tears: For, by much terrour, and much cruelty, He kills them, ten times over, e're they die. When, such like Magistrates have rule obtain'd The best men wish their power might be restrain'd: But, they who shun enormities, through Fear, Are glad when good-men out of Office are. Yea whether Governours be good or bad, Of their displacings wicked-men are glad; And when they see them brought into disgraces, They boldly play the Knaves before their faces. Lot 28. M. Thou art, or else thou wert of late, Some Great or Petty Magistrate, Or Fortune thereunto may chance, In time to come thee to advance. But by thine Emblem thou maist see, That when restrain'd thy Power shall be, Offenders will thereof be glad, And Scoff the Power which thou hast had; Observe it, &amp; be so upright, That thou maist laugh at their despight. THE Twenty ninth Emblem Illustrated. True Lovers Lives in one heart lye, Both Live, or both together Dye. He that shall say he Loves, and was again So well-belov'd, that neither He nor She Suspects each other, neither needs to gain New proofs, that they in all Desires agree; And yet, shall cool again in their Affection, (And leave to Love) or live till they are Lovers The second-time; It some gross Imperfection In One (if not in Both) of them discovers. It was not Love which did between them grow; But, rather somewhat like unto the same; Which (having made a fair deceiving Show) Obtain'd, a while, that honourable Name. For, False Affections will together play So lovingly; and oft, so act those Parts Which real seem; that, for a time, they may Appear the Children of Unfeigned-Hearts: Yea, many-times, true Turtles are deceiv'd By counterfeited Passions, till their Love Of her true Object finds her self bereav'd; And after it, is forced to remove: But where True-Love begetteth, and enjoys The proper Object, which she doth desire, Nor Time, nor Injury the same destroys; But it continues a Perpetual Fire. Like am'rous Thisbe to her Pyramus, On all occasions, it continues true: Nor Night, nor Danger, makes it timorous; But, through all Perils, it will him pursue. Thus, both in Life, in Death, in all estates, True Lovers will be true Associates. Lot 29. Some think you Love; 'tis true you do, And are as well beloved too. But you (if we the truth may say) Love not so truly as you may. To make a perfect Love there goes, Much more than every Lover knows, Your Emblem therefore mind, and then, Begin anew to love agen. THE Thirtieth Emblem Illustrated. Since overmuch will overfill, Pour out enough; but do not spill. It is this Emblems meaning, to advance The love and practice, of true Temperance. For, by this Figure (which doth seem to fill, Until the liquor overflow, and spill) We are, as by example, taught to see How fruitless our Intemperancies be: Thus by the Rule of Contrarieties, Some Vertues, best are shown to vulgar eyes. To see a nastie Drunkard, reel and spew, More moves to Soberness, than can the view Of twenty civil men; and to behold One Prodigal, (that goodly lands hath sold) Stand torn and louzie, begging at the door, Would make Intemperance abhorred more, (And manly Soberness, much better, each) Than all that six Philosophers can preach: So, by the Vessels overflowing, here, True Moderation doth more prais'd appear, Than by the mean it self: And without sin, That's pictur'd, which to do, had wicked bin For, though to vertuous ends; we do deny The Doing-ill, that Good may come thereby. From hence, let us be taught, that carefull heed Whereby we should both Mind and Body feed Let us, of our own selves, observe the size; How much we want, how little will suffize; And our own longings, rather leave unfill'd, Than suffer any portion to be spill'd: For, what we marr, shall to account be laid And, what we wisely spend, shall be repaid Lot 30. If truly temperate thou be, Why should this Lot be drawn by thee? Perhaps thou either dost exceed, In clothes; Or high dost drink or feed. Beyond the mean; If this thou find, Or know'st in any other kind. How thou offendest by excess, Now leave off thy Intemperatness. THE Thirtieth First Emblem Illustrated. When Law and Arms together meet, The world descends to kiss their feet. The Picture of a Crowned king, here, stands Upon a Globe; and with outstretched hands, Holds forth, in view, a Law-book, and a Sword: Which plain and modern Figures may afford This meaning; that a King, who hath regard To Courts for pleading, and a Court of Guard, And at all times, a due respect will carry, To pious Laws, and Actions military; Shall not be Monarch, onely in those Lands, That are by Birth right under his commands But, also might (if just occasion were) Make this whole Globe of earth, his power to fear Advance his Favorites; and bring down all His Opposites, below his pedestal. His conquering Sword, in forraign Realms, he draws, As oft, as there is just, or needful cause: At home, in ev'ry Province of his Lands, At all times, armed are his Trained Bands. His Royal Fleets, are terrours to the Seas; At all hours, rigg'd, for useful Voyages: And often he his Navy doth increase, That Wars Provisions may prolong his Peace. Nor, by the tenure of the Sword, alone, Delighteth he to hold his awful Throne, But, likewise, labours Mischiefs to prevent, By wholsome Laws, and rightful Government. For, where the Sword commands, without the Law, A Tyrant keeps the Land in slavish awe: And where good Laws do want an Armed pow'r, Rebellious Knaves their Princes, will devour. Lot 31. M. Some urge their Princes on to War, And weary of sweet Peace soon are Some seek to make them dote on Peace, Till Publick danger more increase. As if the world were kept in awe, By nothing else, but preaching Law. The Moral is; If such thou art, Then Act a Moderators part. THE Thirty second Emblem Illustrated. The Husbandman doth sow his seeds, And then on Hope till Harvest feeds. The painful Husbandman, with sweaty brows, Consumes in labour many a weary day: To break the stubborn earth, he digs and ploughs, And then, the Corn, he scatters on the clay: When that is done, he harrows in the Seeds, And by a well-cleans'd Furrow, lays it dry: He frees it from the Worms, the Moles, the Weeds; He, on the Fences, also hath an eye. And though he see the chilling Winter bring Snows, Flouds, and Frosts, his Labours to annoy; Though blasting-winds do nip them in the Spring And Summers Mildews threaten to destroy: Yea, though not only Days, but Weeks, they (Nay, many Weeks, and many Months beside) In which he must with pain, prolong his care, Yet, constant in his hopes he doth abide. For this respect, HOPE'S Emblem, here you see Attends the Plough, that men beholding it, May be instructed, or else minded be, What Hopes, continuing Labours, will befit. Though, long thou toyled hast, and long attended About such workings as are necessary; And oftentimes, ere fully they are ended, Shalt find thy pains in danger to miscarry: Yet, be not out of hope, nor quite dejected: For, buried Seeds will sprout when Winter's gone Unlikelier things are many times effected; And God brings help, when men their best have done. Yea, they that in Good-works their life imploy; Although they sow in tears, shall reap in joy. Lot 32. In many things, the worse thou art, By the despairing, fainting heart. And oft thy labour, and thy cost, For want of Hopefulness is lost. Thou therefore by thy Lot art sent, This Indiscretion to prevent, And by the Plow-mans hope to see Thy fault, and now reform'd to be. THE Thirty third Emblem Illustrated. Let him that at Gods Altar stands, In Innocency wash his hands. When (Reader) thou hast first of all survaid That Reverend Priest which here ingraven stands, In all his Holy Vestiments array'd, Endeavouring for Purified-Hands; Collect from hence, that, when thou dost appear To offer Sacrifice of Praise or Prayer, Thou oughtst the Robes of Righteousness, to wear, And by Repentance, thy defects repair. For, thou, that with polluted Hands presum'st Before Gods Altar to present thy Face; Or, in the Rags of thine own Merits com'st, Shalt reap Displeasure, where thou look'st for Grace. Then, if thou be of those that would aspire A Priest, or Prelate, in Gods Church to be; Be sure, thou first those Ornaments acquire, Which may be suting to that High Degree. Intrude not, as perhaps too many do, With Gifts unfit, or by an Evil mean: Desire it with a right Intention too; And seek to keep thy Conversation clean. For, they that have assum'd this Holy-Calling, With Hands impure, and Hearts unsanctify'd, Defame the Truth; give others cause of Falling, And scandalize their Brethren, too beside: Yea, to themselves, their very Sacrifice Becomes unhallowed; and their Thanks and Prayers, The God of Purity, doth so despise, That all their Hopes, he turneth to Despairs: And all their best Endeavours, countermands, Till they appear with unpolluted Hands. Lot 33. Whether meerly Chance or no, Brought this Lot, we do not know. But received let it be, As Divinely sent to thee. For that merits thy regard, Which thine Emblem hath declar'd. And the best that are have need Such Advisements well to heed. THE Thirty fourth Emblem Illustrated. Be wary whosoe're thou be, For from Loves Arrows none are free. Gallants, beware; for here's a wanton Wagg, Who, having Bows and Arrows, makes his brag That he hath some unhappy trick to play; And vows to shoot at all he meets to day. Pray be not careless; for the Boy is blind, And sometimes strikes, where most he seemeth kind. This rambling Archer spares nor one, nor other: Yea, otherwhile, the Monkey shoots his Mother. Though you be little Children, come not near; For, I remember (though't be many a year Now gone and past,) that, when I was a Lad, My Heart, a prick, by this young wanton had That pain'd me seven years after: nor had I The grace (thus warn'd) to escape his waggery But many times, ev'n since I was a man, He shot me, oftner then I tell you can: And if I had not been the stronger-hearted, I for my over-daring, might have smarted. You laugh now, as if this were nothing so, But, if you meet this Blinkard with his Bow, You may unless you take the better care, Receive a wound, before you be aware. I fear him not; for I have learned how To keep my heart-strings from his Arrows now: And so might you, and so might ev'ry one That vain Occasions truely seeks to shun. But if you slight my Counsels, you may chance To blame at last, your wilful ignorance: For, some, who thought, at first, his wounds but small, Have dyed by them, in an Hospital. Lot 34. This Lot of yours, doth plainly show. That in some danger now you go, But wounds by steel, yet fear you not, No Pistolling nor Canon Shot. But rather dread the Shafts that fly From some deep wounding Wantons eye, your greatest perils are from thence, Get therefore Armor of Defence. THE Thirty fifth Emblem Illustrated. He over all the Stars doth reign, That unto wisdom can attain. I am not of their Mind, who think the Sun, The Moon, the Planets, and those glorious Lights, Which trim the Sphæres, do in their Motions run To no more purpose, then to please our Sights. Nor for distinguishment of Nights and Days, Or of the Seasons, and the Times, alone, Can I suppose the Hand of God displays Those many Stars we nightly gaze upon: For, both by Reason, and by Common sense We know (and often feel) that from above The Planets have, on us, an Influence; And that our Bodies vary, as they move. Moreover, Holy Writ infers, that these Have some such pow'r; ev'n in those Places whe[illeg.] It names Orion, and the Pleiades; Which Stars of much inferiour Nature are. Yet, hence conclude not therefore, that the Mind Is by the Stars constrained to obey Their Influence; or, so by them inclin'd, That, by no means resist the same we may. For, though they form the Bodies temp'rature, (And though the Mind inclineth after that) By Grace, another temper we procure, Which guides the Motions of Supposed Fate. The Soul of Man is nobler then the Sphæres; And if it gain the Place which may be had, Not here alone on Earth, the Rule it bears, But, is the Lord of all that God hath made. Be wise in him; and if just cause there be, The Sun and Moon, shall stand and wait on thee. Lot. 35. You seek a Lot which proving bad, Would peradventure make you sad; [illeg.]t this may please; for you are taught, To mend your Fortune, when 'tis naught. Being armed with such Counsel here, That you no Destiny need fear; Now if you come to hurt or shame, Upon the Stars lay not the blame. THE Thirty sixth Emblem Illustrated. Thy seeming Lovers false will be, And love thy Money more than thee. What may the reason be, so many wed, And miss the blessings of a joyful-Bed, But those ungodly, and improper ends, For which, this Age most Marriages intends? Some love plump-flesh; and those as kind will be To any gamesome Wanton, as to thee. Some, dote on Honours; and all such will prize Thy Person meerly, for thy Dignities. Some fancy Pleasures; and such Flirts as they, With ev'ry Hobby-horse, will run away. Some (like this Couple in our Emblem, here) Woe hard for Wealth; and very kind appear, Till they have won their prize but then they show On what their best Affections they bestow. This Wealth, is that sweet Beauty, which prefers So many to their Executioners. This is that rare Perfection, for whose sake, The Politician doth his Marriage make. Yea, most of those whom you shall married find, Were cous'ned, (or did cousen) in this kind; And for some by-respects, they came together, Much more, than for the sakes of one another If this concerns thee, now, in any sense; For thy instruction, take this warning hence If thou hast err'd already, then lament Thy passed crime, and bear thy punishment. If thou, as yet, but tempted art to err; Then, let this Emblem be thy Counseller: For, I have said my mind; which if thou slight Go, and repent it, on thy wedding night. Lot 36. This Lot may make us all suspect, That some wrong Object you affect. And that where Dearness you pretend; It is not for the noblest end. What mischief from such falshood flows, Your Emblem very truly shows. And may more happy make your Fate; If this advice come not too late. THE Thirty seventh Emblem Illustrated. By Studiousness in Virtues ways, Men gain an universal Praise. When Emblems of too many parts consist, Their Author was no choice Emblematist, But is like those that waste whole hours, to tell What, in three minutes, might be said as well. Yet, when each member is interpreted, Out of these vulgar Figures, you may read A Moral, (altogether) not unfit To be remembred, ev'n by men of wit. And if the Kernell prove to be of worth, No matter from what shell we drew it forth. The Square whereon the Globe is placed, here Must Vertue be; That Globe upon the Square, Must mean the World; The Figure, in the Round, (Which in appearance doth her Trumpet sound) Was made for Fame; The Book she bears, may show, What Breath it is, which makes her Trumpet blow: The Wreath, inclosing all, was to intend A glorious Praise, that never shall have end: And these, in one summ'd up, do seem to say; That, (if men study in a vertuous-way) The Trumpet of a never-ceasing Fame, Shall through the world proclaim their praisefull Name. Now Reader, if large Fame, be thy ambition, This Emblem doth inform, on what condition She may be gain'd. But, (herein, me believe) Thy study for meer-praise, will thee deceive: And if thy Vertues, be but onely, those For which the vulgar Fame, her Trumpet blows, Thy Fame's a blast; Thy Vertues Vices be; Thy Study's vain, and shame will follow thee. Lot 37. Thou seek'st for fame and now art shown, For what her Trumpet shall be blown. Thine Emblem also doth declare, What Fame they get who Virtuous are, For Praise alone; And what reward, For such like Studies is prepar'd. Peruse it; And this Counsel take, Be Virtuous for meer Virtues sake. THE Thirty eighth Emblem Illustrated. The Gospel thankfully imbrace, For God vouchsafed us this Grace. This modern Emblem, is a mute expressing Of Gods great Mercies, in a Modern-blessing; And gives me, now, just cause to sing his praise, For granting me, my being, in these days. The much-desired Messages of Heav'n, For which, our Fathers would their lives have given, And (in Groves, Caves, and Mountains, once a year) Were glad, with hazard of their goods to hear; Or, in less bloody times, at their own homes; To hear, in private, and obscured rooms. Lo; those, those Joyful-tydings, we do live, Divulg'd, in every Village, to perceive; And that the sounds of Gladness eccho may, Through all our goodly Temples, ev'ry day. This was (Oh God) thy doing; unto thee, Ascrib'd, for ever, let all Praises be. Prolong this Mercy and vouchsafe the fruit, May to thy Labour, on this Vine-yard, suit: Lest, for our fruitlesness, thy Light of grace, Thou from our Golden candlestick, displace. We do, me thinks, already, Lord, begin To Wantonize, and let that loathing in, Which makes thy Manna tastless; And I fear, That, of those Christians, who, more often hear, Then practice, what they know, we have too many; And, I suspect my self, as much as any. Oh! mend me so, that, by amending me, Amends in others, may increased be: And, let all Graces, which thou hast bestow'd, Return thee honour, from whom first they flow'd. Lot 38. By this thy Lot thou dost appear, To be of those who love to hear The Preachers voice; Or else of them, That undervalue or Contemn Those daily showers of wholesome words, Which Heaven in these our times affords. Now which soe're of these thou be, Thine Emblem something teacheth thee. THE Thirty ninth Emblem Illustrated. An Innocent no danger fears, How Great soever it appears. When some did seek Arion to have drown'd; He, with a valiant heart, his Temples crown'd: And when to drench him in the Seas they meant, He plaid on his molodious Instrument; To shew, that Innocence disdained Fear, Though to be swallow'd in the Deeps it were. Nor did it perish: For, upon her Back A Dolphin took him, for his Musick's sake: To intimate that Vertue shall prevail With Bruitish Creatures, if with Men it fail. Most vain is then their Hope, who dream they can, Make wretched, or undo, an Honest-Man: For, he whom Vertuous Innocence adorns, Insults o're Cruelties; and Peril scorns. Yea, that, by which Men purpose to undo him (In their despight) shall bring great Honours to him, Arion-like, the Malice of the World, Hath into Seas of Troubles often hurl'd Deserving Men, although no Cause they had, But that their Words &amp; Works sweet Musick made Of all their outward Helps it hath bereft them Nor means, nor hopes of Comfort have been left them, But such, as in the House of Mourning are, And what Good-Conscience can afford them there Yet, Dolphin-like, their Innocence hath rear'd Their Heads above those Dangers that appear'd God hath vouchsaf'd their harmless Cause to heed And ev'n in Thraldom, so their Hearts hath freed That, whil'st they seem'd oppressed &amp; forlorn, The Joy'd, and Sung, and Laugh'd the World to scorn. Lot 39. You have been wronged many ways, Yet Patient are, and that's your Praise. Your Actions also seem'd upright, Yet some there are that bear you spight. Lest therefore you discourag'd grow, An Emblem you have drawn to show, What other Innocents have born, And how the Envious world to scorn. THE Fortieth Emblem Illustrated. By many strokes the Work is done, Which cannot be performed by one. Despair not Man, in what thou oughtst to do, Although thou fail when one Attempt is made; But, add a New-Endeavour thereunto, And then another, and another, add: Yea, till thy Pow'r and Life shall quite be spent, Persist in seeking what thou shouldst desire; For, he that falleth from a good Intent, Deserves not that to which he did aspire. Rich Treasures are by Nature placed deep; And ere we gain them, we must pierce the Rocks: Such Perils, also, them, as Guardians keep, That none can win them without wounds and known Moreover, Glories, Thrones, are so sublime, That whosoever thinks their Top to gain, Till many thousand weary steps he clime, Doth fool himself, by Musings which are vain. And yet, there is a Path way, which doth lead Above the highest things that Man can see; And (though it be not known to all who tread The Common-Tract) it may ascended be. As therefore, none should greater things presume Then well becomes their strength; So none should fear Through Folly, Sloth, or Baseness) to assume Such things upon them, which beseeming are. Since by Degrees we many things see wrought, That seem'd impossible to have been done, When they were first conceived in the thought And such as these, we may adventure on. Mine Arm, I know, in time will fell an Oke; But, I will ne're attempt it, at a Stroke. Lot 40. This Lot befell thee for the nonce, For if things come not all at once. Thou to despairing soon dost run, Or leav'st thy work that's well begun. Which to prevent regardful be, Of what thine Emblem Counsels thee. THE Forty first Emblem Illustrated. Occasions past are sought in vain, But oft, they wheel about again. Unwise are they that spend their youthful Prime In Vanities; as if they did suppose That men, at pleasure, might redeem the Time; For, they a fair advantage fondly lose. As ill-advis'd be those, who having lost The first Occasions, to Despairing run: For, Time hath Revolutions; and the most, For their Affairs, have Seasons more then one. Nor is their Folly small, who much depend On Transitory things, as if their Power Could bring to pass what should not have an End Or compass that which Time will not devour. The first Occasions, therefore, see thou take (Which offered are) to bring thy hopes about And mind thou, still, what Haste away they make Before thy swift-pac't hours are quite run out. Yet, if an Opportunity be past, Despair not thou, as they that hopeless be; Since, Time may so revolve again, at last, That New-Occasions may be offered thee. And see, thou trust not on those fading things, Which by thine own Endeavours thou acquir'st For, Time (which her own Births to ruin brings Will spare, nor thee, nor ought which thou desir'st His Properties, and Uses, what they are, In vain observ'd will be, when he is fled: That, they in season, therefore may appear, Our Emblem, thus hath him deciphered; Bald save before, and standing on a Wheel; A Razor in his Hand, a Winged Heel. Lot 41. Much Liberty thou hast assum'd, And heretofore too much presum'd. On Time, which always rideth post, That for a while some hopes are crost. But see to keep thee from despair, And thy Misfortune to repair. Mark what to thee thy Lot doth tell, And Practise what is counsel'd well. THE Forty second Emblem Illustrated. When Great Attempts are undergone, Join Strength and Wisdom both in one. If (Reader) thou desirous be to know What by the Centaure, seemeth here intended; What, also by the Snake, and by the Bow, Which in his hand, he beareth alway bended: Learn, that this half-a man, and half-a horse, If ancient Hieroglyphick; teaching thee, That, Wisdom should be joyn'd with outward force, If prosperous we desire our works to be. His Upper-part, the shape of Man, doth bear; To teach, that Reason must become our guide. The hinder-parts a Horses Members are; To show, that we must also strength provide. The Serpent, and the Bow, doth signifie The same (or matter to the same effect) And by two Types, one Moral to imply, Is doubled a fore-warning of neglect. When Knowledge wanteth Power, despis'd we grow And know but how to aggravate our pain: Great strength, will work its own sad overthrow, Unless, it guided be with Wisdoms rein. Therefore, Oh God, vouchsafe thou so to marry The gifts of Soul and Body, both, in me, That, I may still have all things necessary, To work, as I commanded am, by thee. And, let me not possess them, Lord, alone, But, also know their use; and so well know it, That, I may do each duty to be done; And with upright Intentions, always do it. If this be more, then yet obtain I may, My will accept thou, for the deed, I pray. Lot 42. Great things to do, thou hast a mind, But power thereto, thou canst not find; Sometimes thy Power doth seem to fit, But then thou failest in thy wit. Such undertakings therefore chuse, (If thou thy Time wilt not abuse) As to thy Power and wit agree, And then let both imployed be. THE Forty third Emblem Illustrated. They that in Hope and Silence live, The best Contentment may atchieve. If thou desire to cherish true Content, And in a troublous time that course to take, Which may be likely mischiefs to prevent, Some use of this our Hieroglyphick, make. The Fryers Habit, seemeth to import, That, thou (as ancient Monks and Fryers did) Shouldst live remote, from places of resort, And in retiredness, lye closely hid. The clasped-Book, doth warn thee to retain Thy thoughts within the compass of thy breast; And in a quiet silence to remain, Untill thy mind may safely be exprest. That Anchor doth inform thee, that thou must Walk on in Hope; and in thy Pilgrimage, Bear up (without despairing or distrust) Those wrongs, and sufferings, which attend thine Age. For, whensoe're Oppression groweth rife, Obscureness, is more safe than Eminence; He that then keeps his Tongue, may keep his Life Till times will better favour Innocence. Truth spoken where untruth is more approved, Will but enrage the malice of thy foes; And, otherwhile, a wicked man is moved To cease from wrong, if no man him oppose Let this our Emblem, therefore, counsel thee Thy Life in safe Retiredness, to spend: Let in thy breast, thy thoughts reserved be, Till thou art laid, where none can thee offend. And whilst most others, give their Fancy scope Enjoy thy self, in Silence, and in Hope. Lot 43. Thou hast in Publick lived long; And overfreely us'd thy Tongue. But if thy safety thou desire, Be silent and thy self retire; And if thou wilt not be undone, Possess thy Joys and Hopes alone. For they that will from harm be free, Must quiet and obscured be. THE Forty fourth Emblem Illustrated. Take wing my soul, and mount up higher, For Earth fulfils not my desire. When Ganymed, himself was purifying, Great Jupiter, his naked beauty spying, Sent forth his Eagle (from below to take him) A blest Inhabitant in Heav'n to make him: And there (as Poets feigned) he doth still, To Jove, and other God heads, Nectar fill. Though this be but a Fable, of their feigning, The Moral is a Real truth, pertaining To ev'ry one (which harbours a desire Above the Starry Circles, to aspire.) By Ganymed the Soul is understood, That's washed in the Purifying flood Of sacred Baptism (which doth make her seem Both pure and beautiful, in God's esteem.) The Ægle means that Heav'nly Contemplation, Which, after Washings of Regeneration, Lifts up the Mind, from things that earthly be, To view those Objects, which Faith's Eyes do see. The Nectar, which is filled out, and given To all the blest Inhabitants of Heaven, Are those Delights, which (Christ hath said) they have, When some Repentant Soul begins to leave Her foulness; by renewing of her birth, And slighting all the Pleasures of the Earth. I ask not, Lord, those Blessings to receive, Which any Man hath pow'r to take, or give; Nor what this World affords; for I contemn Her Favours; and have seen the best of them; Nay, Heav'n it self, will unsufficient be, Unless Thou also give Thy self to me. Lot 44. This Lot pertaineth unto those, (But who they be, God only knows) Who to the world have no desire, But up to Heavenly things aspire; No doubt but you in some degree, Indu'd with such Affections be, And got this Emblem, that you might Encourag'd be in such a flight. THE Forty fifth Emblem Illustrated. He that his course directly steers, Nor storms, nor windy Censures fears. We to the Sea this World may well compare; For, ev'ry Man which liveth in the same, Is as a Pilot, to some Vessel there, Of little size, or else of larger frame. Some have the Boats of their own Life to guide, Some, govern petty Town ships too beside Some of whole Families row the Barge, (To those compar'd, which of small Barks have charge) Some others rule great Provinces; and they Resemble Captains of huge Argoses: But when of Kingdoms, any gain the Sway, To Generals of Fleets we liken these. Each hath his proper Course to him assign'd, His Card, his Compass, his due Tacklings, too; And if their Business, as they ought they mind, They may accomplish all they have to do. But most Men leave the Care of their own Course, To judge or follow others, in their waies; And when their Follies make their Fortunes worse, They curse the Destiny, which they should praise. For, Waves and Winds, and that oft-changing Weather, Which many blame, as cause of all their Losses, (Though they observe it not) helps bring together Those Hopes, which their own Wisdom often crosses. Regard not, therefore much, what those things be, Which come, without thy fault, to thwart thy Way; Nor, how, Rash-Lookers-on will censure thee; But, faithfully, to do thy part, assay: For, if thou shalt not from this Counsel vary, Let my Hopes fail me, if thy Hopes miscarry: Lot 45. Thy hopes and Fears are always such, That they afflict, and pain thee much, Because thou giv'st too great a scope, Unto thy Fear, and to thy Hope. For they will vex, or pleasure thee, As they enlarg'd, or curbed be. But see, thine Emblem, if thou please, Instructs thee how to manage these. THE Forty sixth Emblem Illustrated. Where Helen is, there will be war, For Death and Lust Companions are. Their foolish humour I could ne're affect, Who dare, for any cause, the Stews frequent: And thither, where I justly might suspect A Strumpet liv'd, as yet, I never went. For, when (as Fools pretend) they go to seek Experience, where more Ill then Good, they see, They venture for their Knowledg, Adam like; And such as his, will their Atchievements be. Let, therefore those that would loose Truls detest, Converse with none, but those that modest are; For, they that can of Whoredom make a Jest, Will entertain it ere they be aware. Chast-Company, and Chast-Discourse, doth make The Mind more pleased with it, ev'ry day; And Frequent views of Wantonness will take The Sense and Hatred of the Vice away. Some, I have known, by Harlots Wiles undone, Who, but to see their Fashions, first pretended; And they that went for Company, alone, By suddain Quarrels, there their Dayes have ended. For in the Lodgings of a Lustfull-Woman, Immodest Impudence hath still her Being; There, Fury, Fraud, and Cruelties are common: And there, is Want, and Shame, and Disagreeing. Ev'n Beauty, of it self, stirs loose Desires, Occasioning both Jealousies, and Fears; It kindleth in the Brest, conceal'd Fires, Which burn the Heart, before the Flame appears: And ev'ry day, experienced are we; That, there where Hellen is, Troys Fate will be. Lot 46. Your Lot is, very much to blame, Or else your Person, or your name, Hath injur'd been; Or may have wrong, By some loose Wanton, ere't be long. Therefore ere hence you go away, Mark what your Emblem here doth say; Perhaps by drawing of this Lot, Some Harms prevention may be got. THE Forty seventh Emblem Illustrated. Who by Good Means Good things would gain, Shall never seek nor ask in vain. In vain fair Cynthia never taketh pains, Nor faints in following her desired Game; And when at any Mark her Bow she strains, The winged Arrow surely hits the same. Her Picture, therefore, in this place doth shew The Nature of their Minds who Cynthia like, With Constancy their Purposes pursue, And faint not till they compass what they seek. For, nought more God-like in this World is found Then so Resolved a man, that nothing may His Resolution alter or confound, When any task of Worth, he doth assay. Nor, is there greater Baseness, then those Minds, That from an Honest purpose can be wrought By Threatnings, Bribes, Smooth-Gales or Boyst'rous; Winds, What ever colour or excuse be brought. You then, that would with Pleasure, Glory gain, Diana like, those modest things require, Which truly may beseem you to attain; And stoutly follow that which you desire: For, changing though the Moon to us appear, She holds a firm Dependence on the Sun; And by a Constant-Motion, in her Sphære With him, doth in Conjunction often run: So, Constant-men, still move their hopes to win But never by a Motion-indirect; Nor will they stop the Course that they are in, Untill they bring their purpose to effect. For, whosoever Honest things requires, A Promise hath of all that he desires. Lot 47. If any thing you do design, Pursue it with a vigorous mind; And if you hope to gather fruit, Be constant in your hopes pursuit. For by your Emblem you may find, The Stars to you are well inclin'd. Provided your attempts be good, For that must still be understood. THE Forty eighth Emblem Illustrated. Use Caution wheresoe're you be. For from deceit no place is free. Some write (but, on what grounds, I cannot tell) That they, who near unto the Deserts dwell, Where Elephants are found, do notice take, What trees they haunt, their sleeping stocks to make; That, when they rest against an half sawn stem It (falling) may betray those Beasts to them. Now, though the part Historical, may err, The Morall, which this Emblem doth inferr, Is over true; and seemeth to imply, The World to be so full of Treachery, As that no corner of it, found can be, In which from Falshoods Engines, we are free. I have observ'd the City, and I find, The Citizens, are civil, grave and kind; Yet many are deluded by their shows, And cheated, when they trust in them repose. I have been oft at Court; where I have spent, Some idle time, to hear them Complement: But I have seen in Courtiers such deceit. That for their Favours, I could never wait. I do frequent the Church; and I have heard Gods judgments, by the Preachers, there declar'd, Against mens falshoods; and I gladly hear Their zealous Prayers, and good Counsels there; But as I live, I find some such as they, Will watch to do a mischief, if they may. Nay those poor sneaking Clowns, who seek their living, As if they knew no manner of deceiving; Ev'n those, their wit, can (this way) so apply, That they'l soon cousen wiser men, than I. Lot. 48. Some Foes for thee do lye in wait, Where thou suspectest no deceit. Yea many do thy hurt intend, Who yet pretend the name of friend. Be therefore careful whom you trust, What ways thou walkst and what thou dost, For by thine Emblem thou mayst see, That wariness will needful be. THE Forty ninth Emblem Illustrated. All flesh is like the wither'd Hay, It springs, and grows, and fades away. This Infant, and this little Truss of Hay, When they are moralized, seem to say, That Flesh is but a tuft of Morning-Grass, Both green, and wither'd, ere the day-light pass. And such we truly find it; for behold, Assoon as man is born, he waxeth old, In Griefs, in Sorrows, or Necessities; And withers ev'ry hour, until he dies: Now flourishing as Grass, when it is grown, Straight perishing, as Grass, when it is mown. If we with other things, mans Age compare, His Life is but a Day (For equall'd are His Years with Hours: His Months will Minutes be Fit parallels; and ev'ry breathing we May term a Day) yet, some ev'n at the Night Of that short Day, are dead, and withered quite. Before the Morning of our lives be done, The Flesh oft fades: Sometime, it grows till Noon: But there's no mortal Flesh, that will abide Unparched longer, than till Evening-tide. For in it self it always carries that, Which helpeth so it self to ruinate; That though it feel, nor storm, nor scorching flame, An inbred Canker, will consume the same. Considering well, and well remembring this, Account the Flesh no better than it is: Wrong not thine everlasting Soul, to cherish A Gourd, which in a moments time will perish. Give it the tendance fit for fading Crops; But for Hay-harvest, lose not better hopes. Lot 49. Thy flesh thou Lov'st, as if it were The chiefest object of thy care; And of such value as may seem, Well meriting thy best esteem. But now to banish that conceit, Thy Lot an Emblem brings to sight. Which without Flattery shews to thee, Of what regard it ought to be. THE Fiftieth Emblem Illustrated. Even as the smoke doth pass away, So shall all worldly pomp decay. Some better Arguments, then yet I see, I must perceive; and better causes, why To those gay things I should addicted be, To which the vulgar their Affections tye. I have consider'd Scepters, Miters, Crowns, With each appurtenance to them belonging; My heart, hath search'd their Glories, and Renowns, And all the pleasant things about them thronging: My Soul, hath truly weigh'd, and took the measure Of Riches (which the most have so desir'd) I have distill'd the Quintessence of Pleasure, And seen those Objects, that are most admir'd. I likewise feel all Passions, and Affections, That help to cheat the Reason, and perswade That those poor Vanities have some perfections, Whereby their Owners, happy might be made. Yet when that I have rouzed my understanding, And cleans'd my Heart from some of that Corruption, Which hinders in me Reason's free commanding, And shews things without vails or interruption; Then they, methinks, as fruitless do appear, As Bubbles (wherewithall young-children play) Or, as the Smoak, which in our Emblem, here, Now makes a show, and straight consumes away. Be pleas'd, Oh God, my value may be such Of every Outward-blessing here below, That I may neither love them overmuch, Nor underprise the Gifts, thou shalt bestow: But know the use of all these fading Smokes: And be refresht, by that which others chokes. Lot 50. In outward Pomp thy Pleasures are, Thy hope of Bliss is placed there. And thou this folly wilt not leave, Till of content it thee bereave: Unless thou timely come to see How vain all earthly Glories be An Emblem therefore thou hast gain'd, By which this knowledg is obtained. These six following Chances or Lots have no Emblems belonging to them, and therefore you need look no further for them, but make the best of what you have got, these being only added for sport and Recreation. 51. Thy Lot no answer will bestow To that which thou desir'st to know: Nor canst thou here an Emblem find Which to thy purpose is inclin'd. Perhaps it is too late to crave What thou desirest now to have: Or but in vain to mention that, Which thy Ambition aimeth at: Then take it not in evil part, That with a Blank thou answer'd art. 52. It proves a Blank; For to what end, Should we a serious Moral spend. Where Teachings, Warnings and Advice, Esteemed are of little price. Your only purpose is to look Upon the Pictures of this book; When more discretion you have got, An Emblem shall attend your Lot. 53. These Lots are almost five to one Above the Blanks; yet thou hast none, If thus thy fortune still proceed; 'Tis five to one, If well thou speed. Yet if thou dost not much neglect, To do as wisdom shall direct, It is a thousand unto five, But thou in all thy Hopes wilt thrive: 54. You may be glad you drew not that, Which in your mind you guessed at. For it so points out that condition, Whereof you give a great suspition, That had it such an Emblem nam'd, As fits you right you had been sham'd. Since then your fault is unreveal'd, Amend, and keep it still conceal'd. 55. You in your secret thoughts despise, To think an Emblem should advise, Or give you cause to mind or heed, Those things whereof you may have need. And therefore when the Lot you try'd, An answer-justly was denied. Yet (by your leave) there are but few, Who need good Counsel more than you. 56. The Chance which thou obtained hast, Of all the Chances is the last. And casting up the Total sums, We find thy Gain to Nothing comes. Yet if it well be understood, This Chance may Chance to do thee good. For it foretells what Portion shall, To every one at last befall. And warns while something is enjoy'd, That it be always well imploy'd. CONCLUSIONS. 1 The Glories of our Birth and state, Are shadows, not substantial things. There is no Armour 'gainst our fate, Death lays his Icy hands on Kings. Scepter and Crown Must tumble down, And in the dust be equal laid, With the poor crooked Sythe and Spade. 2 Some men with swords may reap the field, And plant fresh Laurels where they kill. But their strong Nerves at length must yield, They tame but one another still. Early or late, They stoop to fate: And must give up their murmuring breath, Whilst the pale Captive creeps to Death. 3 The Laurel withers on your Brow, Then boast no more your mighty Deeds. For on Deaths Purple Altar now, See where the Victor, Victim bleeds, All heads must come, To the cold Tomb. Only the Actions of the Just, Smell sweet and blossom in the dust. [If King, Queen, Prince, or any one that springs] Directions for finding the Chances in the following Lottery. Turn about the Index, upon the following Lottery or figure, without casting your eyes thereupon to observe where it stayeth, till your hand ceaseth to give it motion; and then look, upon what number it resteth; Then look for the same number among the Lots, which having read it directs you to the Emblem of the same number likewise; If the Letter M be set before the Lot (as it is in three or four places) then that Lot is proper only to a Man, and therefore if it happen to a woman let her take the next Chance, whether it be Blank or Lot. If it be any number above fifty, there being fifty six in all, it is a Blank Chance, and you may look for your Lot at the latter end of the Book among the six last Chances which are without Emblems. The Tryal whereof is thus contrived without Dice, lest by the Familiar use of them they might sometimes occasion expensive and pernicious Gaming. But If King, Queen, Prince, or any one that springs From Persons, known to be deriv'd from King, Shall seek, for Sport sake, hence to draw their Lots; Our Author says, that he provided not For such as those; Because it were too much For him, to find out Fortunes fit for such, Who, (as he thinks) should rather Aid supply For him to mend his evil Fortunes by. To them he therefore pleased is to give This noble, and this large Prerogative; That they shall chuse from hence, what Lots they please And make them better, if they like not these. All other Personages, of High degree, That will profess our Authors friends to be, This Freedom, likewise have, that till they find A Lot, which is agreeing to their mind, They shall have liberty anew to try Their sought for Chance: And ev'ry time apply The Morals they disliked, unto those, Which are, ill-qualifi'd, among their Foes. All others who this Game, adventure will, Must bear their Fortunes, be they Good or Ill. Directions for the Lottery. The Figure or Lottery. This Game occasions not the frequent crime Of swearing, or mispending of our time, Nor loss of money, for the Play is short, And every Gamester winneth by the sport, We therefore Judg, it may as well become, The Hall, the Parlor, or the Dining Room, As Chefs or Tables; and we think the price Will be as low, because it needs no Dice.
