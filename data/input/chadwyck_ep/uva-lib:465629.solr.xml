      <field name="fulltext">[Book I.] SATYRS UPON THE JESUITS: Written in the Year 1679. And some other PIECES By the same HAND. The Third Edition Corrected. PROLOGUE. For who can longer hold? when every Press, The Bar and Pulpit too has broke the Peace? When every scribling Fool at the alarms Has drawn his Pen, and rises up in Arms? And not a dull Pretender of the Town, But vents his gall in Pamphlet up and down? When all with licence rail, and who will not, Must be almost suspected of the PLOT, And bring his Zeal, or else his Parts in doubt? In vain our Preaching Tribe attack the Foes, In vain their weak Artillery oppose: Mistaken honest men, who gravely blame, And hope that gentle Doctrine should reclaim. Are Texts, and such exploded trifles fit T'impose, and sham upon a Jesuit? Would they the dull Old Fisher-men compare With mighty Suarez, and great Escobar? Such thred-bare proofs, and stale Authorities May Us poor simple Hereticks suffice: But to a sear'd Ignatian's Conscience, Harden'd, as his own Face, with Impudence, Whose Faith in contradiction bore, whom Lies, Nor non-sense, nor Impossibilities, Nor shame, nor death, nor damning can assail: Not these mild fruitless methods will avail. 'Tis pointed Satyr, and the sharps of Wit For such a prize are th' only Weapons fit: Nor needs there Art, or Genius here to use, Where Indignation can create a muse: Should Parts, and Nature fail, yet very spite Would make the arrant'st Wild, or Withers write. It is resolv'd: henceforth an endless War, I and my Muse with them, and theirs declare; Whom neither open Malice of the Foes, Nor private Daggers, nor St. Omer's Dose, Nor all, that Godfrey felt, or Monarchs fear, Shall from my vow'd, and sworn revenge deter. Sooner shall false Court Favourites prove just; And faithful to their Kings, and Countrys trust: Sooner shall they detect the tricks of State, And knav'ry, suits, and bribes, and flatt'ry hate: Bawds shall turn Nuns, Salt D?s grow chast, And Paint, and Pride, and Lechery detest: Popes shall for Kings Supremacy decide, And Cardinals for Huguenots be try'd: Sooner (which is the great'st impossible) Shall the vile Brood of Loyola, and Hell Give o're to Plot, be Villains, and Rebel; Than I with utmost spite, and vengeance cease To prosecute, and plague their cursed race. The rage of Poets damn'd, of Womens Pride Contemn'd, and scorn'd, or proffer'd lust denied: The malice of Religious angry Zeal, And all, cashier'd resenting Statesmen feel: What prompts dire Hags in their own blood to write And sell their very souls to Hell for spite: All this urge on my rank envenom'd spleen, And with keen Satyr edg my stabbing Pen: That its each home-set thrust their blood may draw, Each drop of Ink like Aquafortis gnaw. Red hot with vengeance thus, I'll brand disgrace So deep, no time shall e're the marks deface: Till my severe, and exemplary doom Spread wider than their guilt, till it become More dreaded than the Bor, and frighten worse Than damning Pope's Anathema's, and curse. SATYR I. Garnet's Ghost addressing to the Jesuits, met in private Cabal just after the Murder of Godfrey. By Hell 'twas bravely done! what less than this? What Sacrifice of meaner worth, and price Could we have offer'd up for our success? So fare all they, who e're provoke our hate, Who by like ways presume to tempt their fate; Fare each like this bold medling Fool, and be As well secur'd, as well dispatch'd as he: Would he were here, yet warm, that we might drain His reaking gore, and drink up ev'ry vein! That were a glorious sanction, much like thine. Great Roman! made upon a like design: Like thine; we scorn so mean a Sacrament, To seal, and consecrate our high intent, We scorn base Blood should our great League cement: Thou didst it with a slave, but we think good To bind our Treason with a bleeding God. Would it were His (why should I fear to name, Or you to hear't?) at which we nobly aim! Lives yet that hated en'my of our Cause? Lives He our mighty projects to oppose? Can His weak innocence, and Heaven's care Be thought security from what we dare? Are you then Jesuits? are you so for nought? In all the Catholick depths of Treason taught? In orthodox, and solid pois'ning read? In each profounder art of killing bred? And can you fail, or bungle in your trade? Shall one poor life your cowardize upbraid? Tame dastard slaves! who your profession shame, And fix disgrace on our great Founder's name. Think what late Sect'ries (an ignoble crew, Not worthy to be rank'd in sin with you) Inspir'd with lofty wickedness, durst do: How from his Throne they hurl'd a Monarch down, Aud doubly eas'd him of both Life, and Crown: They scorn'd in covert their bold act to hide, In open face of Heav'n the work they did, And brav'd its vengeance, and its pow'rs defi'd. This is his Son, and mortal too like him, Durst you usurp the glory of the crime; And dare ye not? I know, you scorn to be By such as they, out-done in villany, Your proper province; true, you urg'd them on, Were engins in the fact, but they alone Share all the open credit, and renown. But hold! I wrong our Church, and Cause, which need No forein instance, nor what others did: Think on that matchless Assassin, whose name We with just pride can make our happy claim; He, who at killing of an Emperor, To give his poison stronger force, and pow'r Mixt a God with't, and made it work more sure: Blest memory! which shall through Age to come Stand sacred in the Lists of Hell, and Rome. Let our great Clement, and Ravillac's name, Your Spirits to like heights of sin inflame; Those mighty Souls, who bravely chose to die T'have each a Royal Ghost their company. Heroick Act! and worth their tortures well, Well worth the suff'ring of a double Hell, That, they felt here, and that below, they feel. And if these cannot move you, as they shou'd, Let me, and my example fire your blood: Think on my vast attempt, a glorious deed, Which durst the Fates have suffer'd to succeed, Had rival'd Hells most proud exploit, and boast, Ev'n that, which wou'd the King of Fates depos'd, Curst be the day, and ne're in time inrol'd, And curst the Star, whose spiteful influence rul'd The luckless Minute, which my project spoil'd: Curse on that Pow'r, who, of himself afraid, My glory with my brave design betray'd: Justly he fear'd, lest I, who strook so high In guilt, should next blow up his Realm, and Sky: And so I had; at least I would have durst, And failing, had got off with Fame at worst. Had you but half my bravery in Sin, Your work had never thus unfinish'd bin: Had I bin Man, and the great Act to do; H'ad dy'd by this, and bin what I am now, Or what His Father is: I would leap Hell To reach His Life, tho in the midst I fell, And deeper than before.— Let rabble Souls, of narrow aim, and reach, Stoop their vile Necks, and dull Obedience preach: Let them with slavish aw (disdain'd by me) Adore the purple Rag of Majesty, And think't a sacred Relick of the Sky: Well may such Fools a base Subjection own, Vassals to every Ass, that loads a Throne: Unlike the soul, with which proud I was born, Who could that sneaking thing a Monarch scorn, Spurn off a Crown, and set my foot in sport Upon the head, that wore it, trod in dirt. But say, what is't that binds your hands? do's fear From such a glorious action you deter? Or is't Religion? but you sure disclaim That frivolous pretence, that empty name: Meer bugbear word, devis'd by Us to scare The sensless rout to slavishness, and fear, Ne're know to aw the brave, and those, that dare. Such weak, and feeble things may serve for checks To rein, and curb base-mettled Hereticks; Dull creatures, whose nice bogling consciences Startle, or strain at such slight crimes as these; Such, whom fond inbred honesty befools, Or that old musty piece the Bible gulls: That hated Book, the bulwark of our foes, Whereby they still uphold their tott'ring cause. Let no such toys mislead you from the road Of glory, nor infect your Souls with good: Let never bold incroaching Virtue dare With her grim holy face to enter there, No, not in very Dream: have only will Like Fiends, and Me to covet, and act ill: Let true substantial wickedness take place; Usurp, and Reign; let it the very trace (If any yet be left) of good deface. If ever qualms of inward cowardice (The things, which some dull sots call conscience) rise, Let them in streams of Blood, and slaughter drown, Or with new weights of guilt still press 'em down. Shame, Faith, Religion, Honor, Loyalty, Nature it self, whatever checks there be To loose, and uncontrol'd impiety, Be all extinct in you; own no remorse But that you've balk'd a sin, have been no worse, Or too much pity shewn.— Be diligent in Mischiefs Trade, be each Performing as a Dev'l; nor stick to reach At Crimes most dangerous; where bold despair, Mad lust, and heedless blind revenge would ne're Ev'n look, march you without a blush, or fear, Inflam'd by all the hazards, that oppose, And firm, as burning Martyrs, to your Cause. Then you're true Jesuits, then you're fit to be Disciples of great Loyola, and Me: Worthy to undertake, worthy a Plot, Like this, and fit to scourge an Huguenot. Plagues on that Name! may swift confusion seize, And utterly blot out the cursed Race: Thrice damn'd be that Apostate Monk, from whom Sprung first these Enemies of Us, and Rome: Whose pois'nous Filth, dropt from ingend'ring Brain, By monstrous Birth did the vile Insects, spawn, Which now infest each Country, and defile With their o'respreading swarms this goodly Ile, Once it was ours, and subject to our Yoke, Till a late reigning Witch th' Enchantment broke: It shall again: Hell and I say't: have ye But courage to make good the Prophesie: Not Fate it self shall hinder.— Too sparing was the time, too mild the day, When our great Mary bore the English sway? Unqueen-like pity marr'd her Royal Pow'r, Nor was her Purple dy'd enough in Gore. Four, or five hundred, such like petty sum Might fall perhaps a Sacrifice to Rome, Scarce worth the naming: had I had the Pow'r, Or been thought fit t'have been her Counsellor, She shou'd have rais'd it to a nobler score. Big Bonfires should have blaz'd, and shone each day, To tell our Triumphs, and make bright our way: And when 'twas dark, in every Lane, and Street Thick flaming Hereticks should serve to light And save the needless Charge of Links by night: Smithfield should still have kept a constant fire, Which never should be quench'd, never expire, But with the lives of all the miscreant rout, Till the last gasping breath had blown it out. So Nero did, such was the prudent course Taken by all his mighty Successors, To tame like Hereticks of old by force: They scorn'd dull reason, and pedantick rules To conquer, and reduce the harden'd Fools: Racks, Gibbets, Halters were their arguments, Which did most undeniably convince: Grave bearded Lions manag'd the dispute, And reverend Bears their Doctrines did confute: And all, who would stand out in stiff defence, They gently claw'd, and worried into sense: Better than all our Sorbon dotards now, Who would by dint of words our Foes subdue. This was the rigid Discipline of old, Which modern sots for Persecution hold: Of which dull Annalists in story tell Strange Legends, and huge bulky Volumes swell With Martyr'd Fools, that lost their way to Hell. From these, our Church's glorious Ancestors, We've learnt our arts, and made their Methods ours: Nor have we come behind, the least degree, In acts of rough and manly cruelty: Converting Faggots, and the pow'rful stake, And Sword resistless our Apostles make. This heretofore Bohemia felt, and thus Were all the num'rous Proselytes of Huss Crush'd with their head: So Waldo's cursed rout, And those of Wickliff here were rooted out, Their names scarce left.—Sure were the means, we chose, And wrought prevailingly: Fire purg'd the dross Of those foul Heresies, and sovereign Steel Lopt off th' infected Limbs the Church to heal. Renown'd was that French Brave, renown'd his deed, A deed, for which the day deserves its red Far more than for a paltry Saint, that died: How goodly was the Sight! how fine the Show When Paris saw through all its Channels flow The blood of Huguenots; when the full Sein, Swell'd with the flood, its Banks with joy o're-ran! He scorn'd like common Murderers to deal By parcels, and piecemeal; he scorn'd Retail I'th' Trace of Death: whole Myriads died by th' great, Soon as one single life; so quick their Fate, Their very Pray'rs, and Wishes came too late. This a King did: and great, and mighty 'twas. Worthy his high Degree, and Pow'r, and Place, And worthy our Religion, and our Cause: Unmatch'd 'thad been, had not Mac-quire arose, The bold Mac-quire (who, read in modern Fame, Can be a Stranger to his Worth, and Name?) Born to out-sin a Monarch, born to Reign In Guilt, and all Competitors disdain: Dread memory! whose each mention still can make Pale Hereticks with trembling Horror quake. T'undo a Kingdom, to atchieve a crime Like his; who would not fall and die like him? Never had Rome a nobler service done, Never had Hell; each day came thronging down Vast shoals of Ghosts, and mine was pleas'd, &amp; glad, And smil'd, when it the brave revenge survey'd. Nor do I mention these great Instances For bounds, and limits to your wickedness: Dare you beyond, something out of the road Of all example, where none yet have trod, Nor shall hereafter: what mad Catiline Durst never think, nor's madder Poet feign. Make the poor baffled Pagan Fool confess, How much a Christian Crime can conquer his: How far in gallant mischief overcome, The old must yield to new, and modern Rome. Mix Ills past, present, future, in one act; One high, one brave, one great, one glorious Fact, Which Hell, and very I may envy— Such as a God himself might wish to be A Complice in the mighty villany And barter's Heaven, and vouchsafe to die. Nor let Delay (the bane of Enterprize) Marr yours, or make the great importance miss. This fact has wak'd your Enemies, and their fear; Let it your vigour too, your haste, and care. Be swift, and let your deeds forestall intent, Forestall ev'n wishes, e're they can take vent, Nor give the Fates the leisure to prevent. Let the full Clouds, which a long time did wrap Your gath'ring thunder, now with sudden clap Break out upon your Foes; dash, and confound, And spread avoidless ruin all around. Let the fir'd City to your Plot give light; You raz'd it half before, now raze it quite. Do't more effectually; I'd see it glow In flames unquenchable as those below. I'd see the Miscreants with their houses burn, And all together into ashes turn. Bend next your fury to the curst Divan; That damn'd Committee, whom the Fates ordain Of all our well-laid Plots to be the bane. Unkennel those State Foxes, where they lie Working your speedy fate, and destiny. Lug by the ears the doting Prelates thence, Dash Heresie together with their Brains Out of their shatter'd heads. Lop off the Lords And Commons at one stroke, and let your Swords Adjourn 'em all to th' other World— Would I were blest with flesh and blood again, But to be Actor in that happy Scene! Yet thus I will be by, and glut my view, Revenge shall take its fill, in state I'll go With captive Ghosts t'attend me down below. Let these the Handsells of your vengeance be, But stop not here, nor flag in cruelty. Kill like a Plague, or Inquisition; spare No Age, Degree, or Sex; only to wear A Soul, only to own a Life, be here Thought crime enough to lose't: no time, nor place Be Sanctuary from your outrages. Spare not in Churches kneeling Priests at pray'r, Tho interceding for you, slay ev'n there. Spare not young Infants smiling at the breast, Who from relenting Fools their mercy wrest: Rip teeming Wombs, tear out the hated Brood. From thence, &amp; drown 'em in their Mothers blood. Pity not Virgins, nor their tender cries, Tho prostrate at your feet with melting eyes All drown'd in tears; strike home, as 'twere in lust, And force their begging hands to guide the thrust. Ravish at th' Altar, kill when you have done, Make them your Rapes, and Victims too in one. Nor let gray hoary hairs protection give To Age, just crawling on the verge of Life: Snatch from its leaning hands the weak support, And with it knock't into the grave with sport; Brain the poor Cripple with his Crutch, then cry, You've kindly rid him of his misery. Seal up your ears to Mercy, lest their words Should tempt a pity, ram 'em with your Swords (Their tongues too) down their throats; let 'em not dare To mutter for their Souls a gasping Pray'r, But in the utt'rance choak't, and stab it there. 'Twere witty handsom Malice (could you do't) To make 'em die, and make 'em damn'd to boot. Make Children by one Fate with Parents die, Kill ev'n revenge in next Posterity: So you'll be pester'd with no Orphans cries, No Childless Mothers curse your Memories. Make Death, and Desolation swim in blood Throughout the Land, with nought to stop the flood But slaughter'd Carcasses; till the whole Isle Become one tomb, become one fun'ral pile; Till such vast numbers swell the countless summ, That the wide Grave, and wider Hell want room. Great was that Tyrants wish, which should be mine, Did I not scorn the leavings of a sin; Freely I would bestow't on England now, That the whole Nation with one neck might grow. To be slic'd off, and you to give the blow. What neither Saxon rage could here inflict, Nor Danes more savage, nor the barb'rous Pict; What Spain, nor Eighty Eight could ere devise, With all its Fleet, and freight of cruelties; What ne'er Medina wish'd, much less could dare, And bloodier Alva would with trembling hear; What may strike out dire Prodigies of old, And make their mild, and gentler acts untold. What Heav'ns Judgments, nor the angry Stars, Foreign Invasions, nor Domestick Wars, Plague, Fire, nor Famine could effect or do; All this, and more be dar'd, and done by you. But why do I with idle talk delay Your hands, and while they should be acting, stay? Farewell ? If I may wast a Pray'r for your success, Hell be your aid, and your high projects bless! May that vile Wretch, if any here there be, That meanly shrinks from brave Iniquity; If any here feel pity, or remorse, May he feel all, I've bid you act, and worse! May he by rage of Foes unpitied fall, And they tread out his hated Soul to Hell. May's Name, and Carcase rot, expos'd alike to be The everlasting mark of grinning Infamy. SATYR II. Nay, if our sins are grown so high of late, That Heav'n no longer can adjourn our fate; May't please some milder Vengeance to devise, Plague, Fire, Sword, Dearth, or any thing but this. Let it rain scalding Showers of Brimstone down, To burn us, and of old the lustful Town: Let a new deluge overwhelm agen, And drown at once our Land, our Lives, our Sin. Thus gladly we'll compound, all this we'll pay, To have this worst of Ills remov'd away. Judgments of other kinds are often sent In mercy only, not for punishment: But where these light, they shew a Nation's fate Is given up, and past for reprobate. When God his stock of wrath on Egypt spent, To make a stubborn Land, and King repent, Sparing the rest, had he this one Plague sent; For this alone his People had been quit, And Pharaoh circumcis'd a Proselyte. Wonder no longer why no Curse, like these, Was known, or suffer'd in the Primitive days: They never sinn'd enough to merit it, 'Twas therefore what Heav'ns just pow'r thought fit, To scourge this latter, and more sinful age With all the dregs, and squeesings of his rage. Too dearly is proud Spain with England quit For all her loss sustein'd in Eighty Eight; For all the Ills, our Warlike Virgin wrought, Or Drake, and Rawleigh her great Scourges brought. Amply was she reveng'd in that one birth, When Hell for her the Biscain Plague brought forth; Great Counter-plague! in which unhappy we Pay back her suff'rings with full usury: Than whom alone none ever was design'd T'entail a wider curse on Human kind, But he, who first begot us, and first sin'd. Happy the World had been, and happy Thou, (Less damn'd at least, and less accurst than now) If early with less guilt in War th' hadst dy'd, And from ensuing mischiefs Mankind freed. Or when thou view'dst the Holy Land, and Tomb, Th' had'st suffer'd there thy brother Traitor's doom. Curst be the womb, that with the Firebrand teem'd, Which ever since has the whole Globe inflam'd; More curst that ill-aim'd Shot, which basely mist, Which maim'd a limb, but spar'd thy hated breast, And made th' at once a Cripple, and a Priest. But why this wish? The Church if so might lack Champions, good works, and Saints for th' Almanack. These are the Janizaries of the Cause, The Life-Guard of the Roman Sultan, chose To break the force of Huguenots, and Foes. The Churches Hawkers in Divinity. Who 'stead of Lace, and Ribbons, Doctrine cry: Rome's Strowlers, who survey each Continent, Its trinkets, and commodities to vent. Export the Gospel, like mere ware, for sale, And truck't for Indigo, and Cutcheneal. As the known Factors here, the Brethren, once Swopt Christ about for Bodkins, Rings, and Spoons. And shall these great Apostles be contemn'd, And thus by scoffing Hereticks defam'd? They, by whose means both Indies now enjoy The two choice Blessings, Pox and Popery? Which buried else in ignorance had been, Nor known the worth of Beads, and Bellarmine? It pitied holy Mother Church to see A World so drown'd in gross Idolatry: It griev'd to see such goodly Nations hold Bad Errors and unpardonable Gold. Strange! what a zeal can powerful Coin infuse! What Charity Pieces of Eight produce! So you were chosen th' fittest to reclaim The Pagan World, and give't a Christian Name. And great was the success; whole Myriads stood At Font, and were baptis'd in their own blood. Millions of Souls were hurl'd from hence to burn Before their time, be damn'd before their turn. Yet these were in compassion sent to Hell, The rest reserv'd in spite, and worse to feel, Compell'd instead of Fiends to worship you, The more inhumane Devils of the two. Rare way, and method of Conversion this, To make your Votaries your Sacrifice! If to destroy be Reformation thought; A Plague as well might the good work have wrought. Now see we why your Founder, weary grown Would lay his former Trade of Killing down; He found 'twas dull, he found a Crown would be A fitter case, and badge of cruelty. Each sniv'lling Hero Seas of Blood can spill, When wrongs provoke, and Honour bids him kill. Each tiny Bully Lives can freely bleed, When press'd by Wine, or Punk to knock o'th' head: Give me your through-pac'd Rogue, who scorns to be Prompted by poor Revenge, or Injury, But does it of true inbred cruelty: Your cool, and sober Murderer, who prays, And stabs at the same time, who one hand has Stretch'd up to Heav'n, t'other to make the Pass. So the late Saints of blessed memory, Cut throats in Godly pure sincerity: So they with lifted hands, and eyes devout, Said Grace, and carv'd a slaughter'd Monarch out. When the first Traitor Cain (too good to be Thought Patron of this black Fraternity) His bloody Tragedy of old design'd, One death alone quench'd his revengeful mind, Content with but a quarter of Mankind: Had he been Jesuit, had he but put on Their savage cruelty; the rest had gone: His hand had sent old Adam after too, And forc'd the Godhead to create anew. And yet 'twere well, were their foul guilt but thought Bare sin: 'tis something ev'n to own a fault. But here the boldest flights of wickedness Are stampt Religion; and for currant pass. The blackest, ugliest, horrid'st, damned'st deed, For which Hell flames, the Schools a Title need, If done for Holy Church; is sanctified. This consecrates the blessed Work; and Tool, Nor must we ever after think 'em foul. To undo Realms, kill Parents, murder Kings, Are thus but petty trifles, venial things, Not worth a Confessor; nay, Heav'n shall be It self invok'd t'abet th' impiety. Grant, gracious Lord, (Some Reverend Villain prays) ‘That this the bold Assertor of our Cause ‘May with success accomplish that great end, ‘For which he was by thee, and us design'd. ‘Do thou t'his Arm, and Sword thy strength impart, ‘And guide 'em steddy to the Tyrants heart. ‘Grant him for every meritorious thrust ‘Degrees of bliss above among the Just; ‘Where holy Garnet, and S. Guy are plac'd, ‘Whom works, like this, before have thither rais'd. ‘Where they are interceding for us now; ‘For sure they're there. Yes questionless, and so Good Nero is, and Dioclesian too, And that great ancient Saint Herostratus, And the late godly Martyr at Thoulouse. Dare something worthy Newgate, and the Tow'r. If you'l be canoniz'd, and Heav'n ensure. Dull prim'tive Fools of old! who would be good, Who would by virtue reach the blest abode: Far other are the ways found out of late, Which Mortals to that happy place translate: Rebellion, Treason, Murder, Massacre, The chief Ingredients now of Saint-ship are, And Tyburn only stocks the Calendar. Unhappy Judas, whose ill fate, or chance Threw him upon gross times of ignorance; Who knew not how to value, or esteem The worth, and merit of a glorious crime! Should his kind Stars have let him acted now; H'ad dy'd absolv'd, and dy'd a Martyr too. Hear'st thou, Great God, such daring blasphemy, And let'st thy patient Thunder still lie by? Strike, and avenge, lest impious Atheists say, Chance guides the world, and has usurp'd thy sway; Lest these proud prosp'rous Villains too confess, Tou'rt sensless, as they make thy Images. Thou just, and sacred Pow'r! wilt thou admit Such Guests should in thy glorious presence sit? If Heav'n can with such company dispence; Well did the Indian pray, Might he keep thence! But this we only feign, all vain, and false, As their own Legends, Miracles, and Tales; Either the groundless calumnies of spite, Or idle rants of Poetry, and Wit. We wish they were: but you hear Garnet cry, ‘I did it, and would do't again; had I ‘As much of Blood, as many Lives as Rome ‘Has spilt in what the Fools call Martyrdom; ‘As many Souls as Sins; I'd freely stake ‘All them, and more for Mother Church's sake. For that I'll stride o're Crowns, swim through a Flood, ‘Made up of slaughter'd Monarch's Brains, and Blood. ‘For that no lives of Hereticks I'll spare, ‘But reap 'em down with less remorse, and care ‘Than Tarquin did the Poppy-heads of old, ‘Or we drop Beads, by which our Pray'rs are told. Bravely resolv'd! and 'twas as bravely dar'd: But (lo!) the Recompence, and great Reward The wight is to the Almanack preferr'd. Rare motives to be damn'd for holy Cause, A few red Letters, and some painted straws! Fools! who thus truck with Hell by Mohatra, And play their Souls against no stakes away. 'Tis strange with what an holy Impudence The Villain caught, his innocence maintains: Denies with Oaths the Fact, untill it be Less guilt to own it than the perjury: By th' Mass, and blessed Sacraments he swears, This Mary's Milk, and t'other Mary's Tears, And the whole muster-roll in Calendars. Not yet swallow the Falshood? if all this Won't gain a resty Faith; he will on's knees Th' Evangelists, and Lady's Psalter kiss. To vouch the Lye: nay, more, to make it good Mortgage his Soul upon't, his Heav'n, and God. Damn'd faithless Hereticks! hard to convince, Who trust no Verdict but dull obvious Sense. Unconscionable Courts! who Priests deny Their Benefit o'th' Clergy, Perjury. Room for the Martyr'd Saints! behold they come! With what a noble Scorn they meet their Doom? Not Knights o'th' Post, nor often Carted Whores Shew more of Impudence, or less Remorse. O glorious, and heroick Constancy! That can forswear upon the Cart, and die With gasping Souls expiring in a Lye. None but tame Sheepish Criminals repent, Who fear the idle Bugbear, Punishment: Your Gallant Sinner scorns that Cowardice, The poor regret of having done amiss: Brave he, to his first Principles still true, Can face Damnation, Sin with Hell in view: And bid it take the Soul, he does bequeath, And blow it thither with his dying breath. Dare such, as these, profess Religion's Name? Who, should they own't, and be believ'd, would shame It's Practice out o'th' World, would Atheists make Firm in their Creed, and vouch it at the Stake? Is Heav'n for such, whose Deeds make Hell too good, Too mild a Penance for their cursed Brood? For whose unheard-of Crimes, and damned Sake Fate must below new sorts of Torture make, Since, when of old it fram'd that place of Doom, Twas thought no guilt, like this, could thither come Base recreant Souls! would you have Kings trust you, Who never yet kept your Allegiance true To any but Hell's Prince? who with more ease Can swallow down most solemn Perjuries, Than a Town Bullie common Oaths, and Lies? Are the French Harry's Fates so soon forgot? Our last blest Tudor? or the Powder-Plot? And those fine Streamers, that adorn'd so long The Bridge, and Westminster, and yet had hung, Were they not stoln, and now for Relicks gone? Think Tories Loyal, or Scotch Covenanters: Robb'd Tygers gentle; courteous, fasting Bears: Atheists devout, and thrice-wrack'd Mariners: Take Goats for Chast, and cloister'd Marmosites: For plain, and open two-edg'd Parasites: Believe Bawds modest, and the shameless Stews, And binding Drunkard Oaths, and Strumpet's Vows: And when in time these Contradiction meet; Then hope to find 'em in a Loyolite: To whom, tho gasping, should I credit give; I'd think 'twere Sin, and damn'd like unbelief. Oh for the Swedish Law enacted here! No Scare-crow frightens like a Priest-Gelder, Hunt them, as Beavers are, force them to buy Their Lives with Ransom of their Lechery. Or let that wholsome Statute be reviv'd, Which England heretofore from Wolves reliev'd: Tax every Shire instead of them to bring Each Year a certain tale of Jesuits in: And let their mangled Quarters hang the Ile To scare all future Vermin from the Soil. Monsters avaunt! may some kind whirlwind sweep Our Land, and drown these Locusts in the deep: Hence ye loath'd Objects of our Scorn, and Hate With all the Curses of an injur'd State: Go, foul Impostors, to some duller Soil, Some easier Nation with your Cheats beguile: Where your gross common Gulleries may pass, To slur, and top on bubled Consciences: Where Ignorance, and th' Inquisition Rules, Where the vile Herd of poor Implicit Fools Are damn'd contentedly, where they are led Blindfold to Hell, and thank, and pay their Guide. Go, where all your black Tribe before are gone, Follow Chastel, Ravillac, Clement down, Your Catesby, Faux, and Garnet, thousands more, And those, who hence have lately rais'd the Score. Where the Grand Traitor now, and all the Crew Of his Disciples must receive their Due: Where Flames, and Tortures of Eternal Date Must punish you, yet ne're can expiate: Learn duller Feinds your unknown Cruelties, Such as no Wit, but yours, could e're devise, No Guilt, but yours, deserve; make Hell confess It self out-done, its Devils damn'd for less. SATYR III. Loyala's Will. Long had the fam'd Impostor found Success, Long seen his damn'd Fraterniti's increase, In Wealth, and Power, Mischief, and Guile improv'd. By Popes, and Pope-rid Kings upheld, and lov'd: Laden with Years, and Sins, and num'rous Scars, Got some i'th' Field, but most in other Wars, Now finding Life decay, and Fate draw near, Grown ripe for Hell, and Roman Calendar, He thinks it worth his Holy Thoughts, and Care, Some hidden Rules, and Secrets to Impart, The Proofs of long Experience and deep Art, Which to his Successors may useful be In conduct of their future Villany. Summon'd together, all th' Officious Band The Orders of their Bedrid-Chief attend; Doubtful, what Legacy he will bequeath, And wait with greedy Ears his dying Breath: With such quick Duty Vassal Fiends below To meet commands of their Dread Monarch go. On Pillow rais'd, he do's their entrance greet, And joys to see the wish'd Assembly meet: They in glad Murmurs tell their Joy aloud, Then a deep silence stills th' expecting Croud, Like Delphick Hag of old, by Fiend possest, He swells, wild Frenzy, heaves his panting Brest, His bristling Hairs stick up, his Eye-Balls glow, And from his Mouth long strakes of Drivel flow: Thrice with due Rev'rence he himself doth cross, Then thus his Hellish Oracles disclose. Ye firm Associates of my great Design, Whom the same Vows, and Oaths, and Order joyn, The faithful Band, whom I, and Rome have chose, The last Support of our declining Cause: Whose Conqu'ring Troops I with Success have led 'Gainst all Opposers of our Church, and Head; Who e're to the mad German owe their Rise, Geneva's Rebels, or the hot-brain'd Swiss; Revolted Hereticks, who late have broke And durst throw off the long-worn Sacred Yoke: You, by whose happy Influence Rome can boast A greater Empire, than by Luther lost: By whom wide Nature's far-stretch'd Limits now, And utmost Indies to its Crosier Bow: Go on, ye mighty Champions of our Cause, Maintain our Party, and subdue our Foes: Kill Heresie, that rank, and pois'nous Weed, Which threatens now the Church to overspread: Fire Calvin, and his Nest of Upstarts out, Who tread our Sacred Mitre under Foot; Stray'd Germany reduce; let it no more Th' Incestuous Monk of Wittemberg adore: Make stubborn Engl. once more stoop its Crown, And Fealty to our Priestly Sovereign own: Regain our Church's Rights, the Island clear From all remaining Dregs of Wickliff there. Plot, Enterprize, contrive, endeavour: spare No toil, nor Pains: no Death, nor Danger fear: Restless your Aims pursue: let no defeat Your sprightly Courage, and Attempts rebate, But urge to fresh, and bolder, ne're to end Till the whole World to our great Caliph bend: Till he thro' every Nation every where Bear Sway, and Reign as absolute, as here: Till Rome without controul, and Contest be The Universal Ghostly Monarchy. Oh! that kind Heaven a longer Thread would give, And let me to that happy Juncture live: But 'tis decreed!—at this he paus'd, and wept, The rest alike time with his Sorrow kept: Then thus continued he—Since unjust Fate Envies my Race of Glory longer date; Yet, as a wounded General, e're he dies, To his sad Troops, sighs out his last Advice, (Who, tho they must his fatal Absence moan, By those great Lessons conquer, when he's gone) So I to you my last Instructions give, And breath out Counsel with my parting Life: Let each to my important words give Ear, Worth your attention, and my dying Care. First, and the chiefest thing by me enjoyn'd. The Solemn'st tie, that must your Order bind, Let each without demur, or scruple pay A strict Obedience to the Roman Sway: To the unerring Chair all Homage Swear, Altho a Punk, a Witch, a Fiend sit there: Who e're is to the Sacred Mitre rear'd, Believe all Vertues with the place conferr'd: Think him establish'd there by Heav'n, tho he Has Altars rob'd for bribes the choice to buy, Or pawn'd his Soul to Hell for Simony: Tho he be Atheist, Heathen, Turk, or Jew, Blasphemer, Sacrilegious, Perjur'd too: Tho Pander, Bawd, Pimp, Pathick, Buggerer, What e're old Sodom's Nest of Lechers were: Tho Tyrant, Traitor, Pois'oner, Parricide, Magician, Monster, all, that's bad beside: Fouler than Infamy; the very Lees, The Sink, the Jakes, the Common-shore of Vice: Strait count him Holy, Vertuous, Good, Devout, Chast, Gentle, Meek, a Saint, a God, who not? Make Fate hang on his Lips, nor Heaven have Pow'r to Predestinate without his leave: None be admitted there, but who he please, Who buys from him the Patent for the Place. Hold those amongst the highest rank of Saints, Whom e're he to that Honour shall advance, Tho here the Refuse of the Jail, and Stews, Which Hell it self would scarce for lumber chuse: But count all Reprobate, and Damn'd, and worse, Whom he, when Gout, or Tissick Rage, shall curse: Whom he in Anger Excommunicates, For Friday Meals, and abrogating Sprats: Or in just Indignation spurns to Hell For jearing Holy Toe, and Pantofle. What e're he says, esteem for Holy Writ, And text Apocryphal, if he think fit: Let arrant Legends, worst of Tales, and Lies, Falser than Capgraves, and Voragines, Than Quixot, Rablais, Amadis de Gaul; Is sign'd with Sacred Lead, and Fisher's Seal Be thought Authentick and Canonical. Again, if he Ordain't in his Decrees, Let very Gospel for meer Fable pass: Let Right be wrong, Black White, and Vertue Vice, No Sun, no Moon, nor no Antipodes: Forswear your Reason, Conscience, &amp; your Creed, Your very Sense, and Euclid, if he bid. Let it be held less heinous, less amiss, To break all Gods Commands, than one of his: When his great Missions call, without delay, Without Reluctance readily Obey, Nor let your Inmost Wishes dare gainsay: Should he to Bantam, or Japan command, Or farthest Bounds of Southern unknown Land, Farther than Avarice its Vassals drives, Thro' Rocks, and Dangers, loss of Blood, and Lives; Like great Xavier's be your Obedience shown, Outstrip his Courage, Glory, and Renown; Whom neither yawning Gulphs of deep Despair, Nor scorching Heats of burning Line could scare: Whom Seas, nor Storms, nor Wracks could make refrain From propagating Holy Faith, and Gain. If he but nod Commissions out to kill, But becken Lives of Hereticks to spill; Let th' Inquisition rage, fresh Cruelties Make the dire Engines groan with tortur'd Cries: Let Campo Flori every day be strow'd With the warm Ashes of the Luth'ran Brood: Repeat again Bohemian Slaughters ore, And Piedmont Vallies drown with floating Gore: Swifter than Murdering Angels, when they fly On Errands of avenging Destiny. Fiercer than Storms let loose, with eager haste Lay Cities, Countries, Realms, whole Nature waste. Sack, Ravish, burn, destroy, slay, massacre, Till the same Grave their Lives, and Names interr: These are the Rights to our great Musty due, The sworn Allegiance of your Sacred Vow: What else we in our Votaries require, What other Gift, next follows to enquire. And first it will our great Advice befit. What Soldiers to your Lists yon ought admit, To Natives of the Church, and Faith, like you, The foremost rank of Choice is justly due: 'Mongst whom the chiefest place assign to those, Whose Zeal has mostly Signaliz'd the Cause. But let not Entrance be to them deny'd, Who ever shall desert the adverse Side: Omit no Promises of Wealth, or Power, That may inveigled Hereticks allure: Those, whom great learning, parts, or wit renowns, Cajole with hopes of Honours, Scarlet Gowns, Provincial ships, and Palls, and Triple Crowns. This must a Rector, that a Provost be, A third succed to the next Abbacy: Some Princes Tutors, others Confessors To Dukes, and Kings, and Queens, and Emperors: These are strong Arguments, which seldom fail, Which more than all your weak disputes prevail. Exclude not those of less desert, decree To all Revolters your Foundation free: To all, whom Gaming, Drunkenness, or Lust, To Need, and Popery shall have reduc'd: To all, whom slighted Love, Ambition crost, Hopes often bilk't, and Sought Preferment lost, Whom Pride, or Discontent, Revenge, or Spite, Fear, Frenzy, or Despair shall Proselyte: Those Pow'rful Motives, which the most bring in, Most Converts to our Church, and Order win. Reject not those, whom Guilt, and Crimes at home Have made to us for Sanctuary come: Let Sinners of each Hue, and Size, and Kind, Here quick admittance, and safe Refuge find: Be they from Justice of their Country fled, With Blood of Murders, Rapes, and Treasons died: No Varlet, Rogue, or Miscreant refuse, From Gallies, Jails, or Hell it self broke loose. By this you shall in Strength, and Numbers grow And shoals each day to your throng'd Cloisters flow: So Rome's and Mecca's first great Founders did, By such wise Methods made their Churches spread. When shaven Crown, and hallow'd Girdle's Power Has dub'd him Saint, that Villain was before; Enter'd, let it his first Endeavour be To shake off all remains of Modesty, Dull sneaking Modesty, not more unfit For needy flatt'ring Poets, when they write, Or trading Punks, than for a Jesuit: If any Novice feel at first a blush, Let Wine, and frequent converse with the Stews Reform the Fop, and shame it out of Use, Unteach the puling Folly by degrees, And train him to a well-bred Shamelesness. Get that great Gift, and Talent, Impudence, Accomplish't Mankind's highest Excellence: 'Tis that alone prefers, alone makes great, Confers alone Wealth, Titles, and Estate: Gains Place at Court, can make a Fool a Peer, An Ass a Bishop, can vil'st Blockheads rear To wear Red Hats, and sit in Porph'ry Chair. 'Tis Learning, Parts, and Skill, and Wit, and Sense, Worth, Merit, Honour, Vertue, Innocence. Next for Religion, learn what's fit to take, How small a Dram do's the just Compond make. As much as is by the Crafty States-men worn For Fashion only, or to serve a turn: To bigot Fools its idle Practice leave, Think it enough the empty Form to have: The outward Show is seemly, cheap, and light, The Substance Cumbersome, of Cost, and Weight: The Rabble judge by what appears to th' Eye, None, or but few the Thoughts within Descry. Make't you an Engine to ambitious Pow'r To stalk behind, and hit your Mark more sure: A Cloak to cover well-hid Knavery, Like it, when us'd, to be with ease thrown by: A shifting Card, by which your Course to steer, And taught with every changing Wind to veer. Let no Nice, Holy, Conscientious Ass Amongst your better Company find place, Me, and your Foundation to disgrace: Let Truth be banisht, ragged Vertue fly, And poor unprofitable Honesty; Weak Idols, who their wretched Slaves betray; To every Rook, and every Knave a Prey: These lie remote, and wide from Interest, Farther than Heaven from Hell, or East from West, Far, as they e're were distant from the breast. Think not your selves t'Austerities confin'd, Or those strict Rules, which other Orders bind, To Capuchins, Carthusians, Cordeliers Leave Penance, meager abstinence, and Prayers: In lousie Rags let Begging Fryars lye, Content on Straw, or Boards to mortifie: Let them with Sackcloath discipline their Skins, And scourge them for their madness, and their Sins: Let pining Anchorets in Grotto's starve, Who from the Liberties of Nature swerve: Who make't their chief Religion not to eat, And place't in nastiness, and want of Meat: Live you in Luxury, and pamper'd Ease, As if whole Nature were your Cateress. Soft be your Beds, as those, which Monarch's Whores Lye on, or Gouts of Bed-rid Emperors: Your Wardrobes stor'd with choice of Suits, more dear Than Cardinals on high Processions wear: With Dainties load your Boards, whose every Dish May tempt cloy'd Gluttons, or Vitellius Wish. Each fit a longing Queen: let richest Wines With Mirth your Heads inflame, with Lust your Veins: Such as the Friends of dying Popes would give For Cordials to prolong their gasping Life. Ne're let the Nazarene, whose Badg, and Name You wear, upbraid you with a Conscious Shame: Leave him his slighted Homilies, and Rules, To stuff the Squabbles of the wrangling Schools; Disdain, that he, and the poor angling Tribe, Should Laws, and Government to you prescribe: Let none of those good Fools your Patterns make; Instead of them, the mighty Judas take. Renown'd Iscariot, fit alone to be Th' Example of our great Society: Whose daring Guilt despis'd the common Road, And scorn'd to stoop at Sin beneath a God. And now 'tis time I should Instructions give, What Wiles, and Cheats the Rabble best deceive: Each Age, and Sex, their diff'rent Passions wear, To suit with which requires a prudent Care: Youth is Capricious, Headstrong, Fickle, Vain, Given to Lawless Pleasure, Age to gain: Old Wives, in Superstition over-grown, With Chimny Tales, and Stories best are won: 'Tis no mean Talent rightly to descry, What several Baits to each you ought apply. The Credulous, and easie of Belief, With Miracles, and well-fram'd Lies deceive. Empty whole Surius, and the Talmud: drain Saint Francis, and Saint Mahomet's Alcoran: Sooner shall Popes, and Cardinals want Pride, Than you a Stock of Lies, and Legends need. Tell how blest Virgin to come down was seen. Like Play-House Punk descending in Machine: How she writ Billets Doux, and Love-Discourse, Made Assignations, Visits, and Amours: How Hosts distrest, her Smock for Banner bore, Which vanquish'd Foes, and murder'd at twelve Score. Relate how Fish in Conventicles met, And Mackrel were with Bait of Doctine caught: How Cattel have Judicious Hearers been, And Stones pathetically cry'd Amen: How consecrated Hives with Bells was hung, And Bees kept Mass, and Holy Anthems Sung: How Pigs to th' Ros'ry kneel'd, and sheep were taught To bleat Te Deum, and Magnificat: How Fly-Flap of Church-Censure Houses rid Of Insects, which at Curse of Fryer dy'd: How travelling Saints, well mounted on a Switch, Ride Journeys thro' the Air, like Lapland Witch: And ferrying Cowls Religious Pilgrims bore O're waves with the help of Sail, or Oar. Nor let Xavier's great Wonders pass conceal'd, How Storms were by th' Almighty Wafer quell'd; How zealous Crab the sacred Image bore, And swam a Cath'lick to the distant Shore With Shams, like these, the giddy Rout mislead, Their Folly, and their Superstition feed. 'Twas found a good, and gainful Art of Old (And much it did our Church's Pow'r uphold) To feign Hobgoblins, Elves, and walking Sprites, And Fairies dancing Salenger a Nights: White-Sheets for Ghosts, and Will-a-wisps have past For Souls in Purgatory unreleast. And Crabs in Church-Yard crawl'd in Masquerade, To cheat the Parish, and have Masses said. By this our Ancestors in happier Days, Did store of Credit, and Advantage raise: But now the Trade is fall'n, decay'd, and dead, E're since Contagious Knowledg has o're-spread: With Scorn the grinning Rabble now hear tell Of Hecla, Patrick's hole, and Mongibel; Believ'd no more, than Tales of Troy, unless In Countries drown'd in Ignorance, like this. Henceforth be wary how such things you feign, Except it be beyond the Cape, or Line: Except at Mexico, Brazile, Pegu, At the Molucco's, Goa, or Pegu, Or any distant, and Remoter Place, Where they may currant, and unquestion'd pass: Where never poching Hereticks resort, To spring the Lye, and make't their Game, and Sport. But I forget (what should be mention'd most) Confession, our chief Priviledg, and Boast: That Staple ware, which ne're returns in vain, Ne're balks the Trader of expected Gain. 'Tis this, that spies through Court-intrigues, and brings Admission to the Cabinets of Kings: By this we keep proud Monarchs at our Becks, And make our Foot-stools of their Thrones &amp; Necks: Give 'em Commands, and if they Disobey; Betray them to th' Ambitious Heir a Prey: Hound the Officious Curs on Hereticks, The Vermin, which the Church infest, and vex: And when our turn is serv'd, and Business done, Dispatch 'em for reward, as useless grown: Nor are these half the Benefits, and Gains, Which by wise Manag'ry accrue from thence: By this w'unlock the Miser's hoarded Chests, And Treasure, though kept close, as States-mens Breasts: This does rich Widows to our Nets decoy, Let us their Jointures, and themselves enjoy: To us the Merchant does his Customs bring, And pays our Duty, tho he cheats his King: To us Court-Ministers refund, made great By Robbery, and Bankrupt of the State: Ours is the Soldier's Plunder, Padder's Prize, Gabels on Letch'ry, and the Stew's Excise: By this our Colledges in Riches shine, And vy with Becket's, and Loretto's Shrine. And here I must not grudge a word or two (My younger Vot'ries) of Advice to you: To you, whom Beautie's Charms, and gen'rous Fire Of boiling Youth to sports of Love inspire: This is your Harvest, here secure, and cheap You may the Fruits of unbought Pleasure reap: Riot in free, and uncontroll'd delight, Where no dull Marriage clogs the Appetite: Tast every dish of Lust's variety, Which Popes, and Scarlet Lechers dearly buy, With Bribes, and Bishopricks, and Simony. But this I ever to your care commend, Be wary how you openly offend: Lest scoffing lewd Buffoons descry our Shame, And fix disgrace on the great Order's fame. When the unguarded Maid alone repairs To ease the burthens of her Sins, and Cares; When youth in each, and privacy conspire To kindle wishes, and befriend desire; If she has practis'd in the Trade before: (Few else of Proselytes to us brought o're) Little of Force, or Artifice will need: To make you in the Victory succeed: But if some untaught Innocence she be, Rude, and unknowing in the mystery; She'll cost more labour to be made comply. Make her by Pumping understand the sport, And undermine with secret trains the Fort, Sometimes as if you'd blame her gaudy dress, Her Naked Pride, her Jewels, Point, and Lace; Find opportunity her Breasts to press: Oft feel her hand, and whisper in her ear, You find the secret marks of lewdness there: Sometimes with naughty sence her blushes raise, And make 'em guilt, she never knew, confess; ‘Thus (may you say) with such a leering smile, ‘So Languishing a look your hearts beguile: ‘Thus with your foot, hand, eye, you tokens speak, ‘These Signs deny, these Assignations make: ‘Thus 'tis you clip, with such a fierce embrace ‘You clasp your Lover to your Breast, and Face: ‘Thus are your hungry lips with Kisses cloy'd, ‘Thus is your hand, &amp; thus your tongue employ'd. Ply her with talk with this: and, if sh' encline, To help Devotion, give her Aretine Instead o'th' Rosary: never despair, She, that to such discourse will lend an Ear Tho chaster than cold cloyster'd Nuns she were, Will soon prove soft, and pliant to your use, As Strumpets on the Carnaval let loose. Credit experience; I have tri'd 'em all, Aud never found th' unerring methods fail: Not Ovid, tho 'twere his chief Mastery, Had greater skill in these Intrigues, than I: Nor Nero's learned Pimp, to whom we owe What choice Records of Lust are extant now. This heretofore, when youth, and sprightly Blood Ran in my Veins, I tasted, and enjoy'd: Ah those blest days,!—(here the old Lecher smil'd, With sweet remembrance of past pleasures fill'd) But they are gone! Wishes alone remain, And Dreams of Joy, ne're to be felt again: To abler Youth I now the Practice leave, To whom this counsel, and advice I give. But the dear mention of my gayer days Has made me farther, than I would, digress: 'Tis time we should now in due Place expound, How guilt is after shrift to be atton'd: Enjoyn no sow'r Repentance, Tear, and Grief; Eyes weep no cash, and you no profit give: Sins, tho of the first rate, must punish'd be, Not by their own, but th' Actor's Quality: The Poor, whose Purse cannot the Penance bear, Let whipping serve, bare feet, and shirts of hair: The richer Fools to Compostella send, To me Rome, Monferrat, or the Holy Land: Pet Pardons, and the Indulgence-Office drain Their Coffers, and enrich the Pope's with gain: Make 'em build Churches, Monasteries found And dear bought Masses for their crimes compound Let Law, and Gospel, rigid precepts set, And make the paths to Bliss rugged, and strait: Teach you a smooth, an easier way to gain Heav'ns joys, yet sweet, and useful sin retain: With every frailty, every lust comply, T'advance your Spiritual Realm, and Monarchy: Pull up weak Vertue's fence, give scope and space And Purliens to out-lying Consciences: Shew that the Needle's eye may stretch, and how The largest Camel-vices may go thro'. Teach how the Priest Pluralities may buy, Yet fear no odious Sin of Simony. While Thoughts, and Ducats will directed be: Let Whores adorn his exemplary life, But no lewd heinous Wife a Scandal give. Sooth up the Gaudy Atheist, who maintains No Law, but Sense, and owns no God, but Chance. Bid Thieves rob on, the Boisterous Ruffian tell, He may for Hire, Revenge, or Honour kill: Bid Strumpets persevere, absolve 'em too, And take their dues in kind for what you do: Exhort the painful, and industrious Bawd To Diligence, and Labour in her Trade: Nor think her innocent Vocation ill, Whose incomes do's the sacred Treasure fill: Let Griping Usurers Extortion use, No Rapine, Falshood, Perjury refuse, Stick at no Crime, which covetous Popes would scarce Act to enrich themselves, and Bastard-Heirs: A small Bequest to th' Church can all atttone, Wipes off all scores, and Heav'n, and all's their own. Be these your Doctrins, these the truths, you preach, But no forbidden Bible come in reach: Your Cheats, and Artifices to Impeach. Lest thence Lay-Fools Pernitious knowledge get, Throw off Obedience, and your Laws forget: Make 'em believ't a spell, more dreadful far, Than Bacon, Haly, or Albumazar. Happy the time, when th' unpretending Crowd No more, than I, its Language understood! When the worm-eaten Book, link'd to a chain, In dust lay mouldring in the Vatican; Dispis'd, neglected, and forgot, to none, But poring Rabbies, or the Sorbon known: Then in full pow'r our Soveraign Prelate sway'd, By Kings, and all the Rabble World Obey'd: Here humble Monarch at his feet kneel'd down, And beg'd the Alms, and Charity of a Crown: There, when in Solemn State he pleas'd to ride, Poor Scepter'd Slaves ran Henchboys by his side: None, tho in thought, his grandeur durst Blaspheme, Nor in their very sleep a Treason dream. But since the broaching that mischievous Piece, Each Alderman a Father Lumbard is: And every Cit dares impudently know More than a Council, Pope, and Conclave too. Hence the late Damned Frier, and all the crew Of former Crawling Sects their poison drew: Hence all the Troubles, Plagues, Rebellions breed, We've felt, or feel, or may hereafter dread: Wherefore enjoyn, that no Lay-coxcomb dare About him that unlawful Weapon wear; But charge him chiefly not to touch at all The dang'rous Works of that old Lollard, Paul; That arrant Wickliffist, from whom our Foes Take all their Batt'ries to attack our Cause; Would he in his first years had Martyr'd been, Never Damascus, nor the Vision seen; Then he our Party was, stout, vigorous, And fierce in chace of Hereticks, like us: Till he at length, by th' Enemies seduc'd, Forsook us, and the hostile side espous'd. Had not the mighty Julian mist his aims, These holy Shreds had all consum'd in flames: But since th' Immortal Lumber still endures, In spight of all his industry, and ours; Take care at least it may not come abroad, To taint with catching Heresie the Crowd: Let them be still kept low in sence, they'l pay The more respect, more readily obey. Pray that kind Heav'n would on their hearts dispense A bounteous, and abundant Ignorance, That they may never swerve, nor turn awry From sound, and Orthodox Stupidity. But these are obvious things, easie to know, Common to every Monk, as well as you: Greater Affairs, and more important wait To be discuss'd, and call for our debate: Matters, that depth require, and well befit Th' Address, and Conduct of a Jesuit. How Kingdoms are embroil'd, what shakes a Throne, How the first seeds of Discontent are sown To spring up in Rebellion; how are set The secret snares, that circumvent a State: How bubled Monarchs are at first beguil'd, Trepann'd, and gull'd, at last depos'd, and kill'd. When some proud Prince, a Rebel to our Head, For disbelieving Holy Church's Creed, And Peter-pence, is Heretick decreed; And by a solemn, and unquestion'd Pow'r To Death, and Hell, and You delivr'd o're: Chuse first some dext'rous Rogue, well tri'd, and known (Such by Confession your Familiars grown) Let him by Art, and Nature fitted be For any great, and gallant Villany, Practis'd in every Sin, each kind of Vice, Which deepest Casuists in their searches miss, Watchful as Jealousie, wary as Fear, Fiercer than Lust, and bolder than Despair, But close, as plotting Feinds in Council are. To him, in firmest Oaths of Silence bound, The worth, and merit of the Deed propound: Tell of whole Reams of Pardon, new come o're, Indies of Gold, and Blessings, endless store: Choice of Preferments, if he overcome, And if he fail, undoubted Maryrdom: And Bills for Sums in Heav'n, to be drawn On Factors there, and at first sight paid down With Arts, and Promises, like these, allure, And make him to your great design secure. And here to know the sundry ways to kill, Is worth the Genius of a Machiavel: Cull Northern Brains, in these deep Arts unbred, Know nought but to cut Throats, or knock o'th' Head, No slight of Murder of the subt'lest shape, Your busie search, and observation scape: Legerdemain of Killing, that dives in, And Juggling steals away a Life unseen: How gawdy Fate may be in Presents sent, And creep insensibly by Touch, or Scent: How Ribbands, Gloves, or Saddle-Pomel may An unperceiv'd, but certain Death convey; Above the reach of Antidotes, above the Pow'r Of the fam'd Pontick Mountebank to cure. What e're is known to quaint Italian spite, In studied Pois'ning skill'd, and exquisite: What e're great Borgia, or his Sire could boast, Which the Expence of half the Conclave cost. Thus may the business be in secret done, Nor Authors, nor the Accessaries known, And the slurr'd guilt with ease on others thrown. But if ill Fortune should your Plot betray, And leave you to the rage of Foes a prey; Let none his Crime by weak confession own, Nor shame the Church, while he'd himself attone. Let varnish'd Guile, and feign'd Hypocrisies, Pretended Holiness, and useful Lies, Your well-dissembled Villany disguise. A thousand wily Turns, and Doubles try, To foil the Scent, and to divert the Cry: Cog, sham, out face, deny, equivocate, Into a thousand shapes your selves translate: Remember what the crafty Spartan taught, Children with Rattles, Men with Oaths are caught: Forswear upon the Rack, and if you fall, Let this great comfort make amends for all, Those, whom they damn for Rogues, next Age shall see Made Advocates i'th' Church's Litany. Who ever with bold Tongue, or Pen shall dare Against your Arts, and Practices declare; What Fool shall e're presumptuously oppose, Your Holy Cheats, and godly Frauds disclose; Pronounce him Heretick, Firebrand of Hell, Turk, Jew, Fiend, Miscreant, Pagan, Infidel; A thousand blacker Names, worse Calumnies, All, Wit can think, and pregnant Spite devise: Strike home, gash deep, no Lies, nor Slanders spare; A Wound, though cur'd, yet leaves behind a Scar. Those, whom your Wit, and Reason can't decry, Make scandalous with Loads of Infamy: Make Luther Monster, by a Fiend begot, Brought forth with Wings, and Tail, and Cloven Foot: Make Whoredom, Incest, worst of vice, and shame, Pollute, and foul his Manners, Life, and Name. Tell how strange Storms usher'd his fatal end, And Hell's black Troops did for his Soul contend. Much more I had to say; but now grown faint, And strength, and Spirits for the Subject want: Be these great Mysteries, I here unfold, Amongst your Order's Institutes enroll'd: Preserve them sacred, close and unreveal'd; As ancient Rome her Sybil's Books conceal'd. Let no bold Heretick with sawcy eye Into the hidden unseen Archives pry; Lest the malicious flouting Rascals turn Our Church to Laughter, Raillery, and Scorn. Let never Rack, or Torture, Pain, or Fear, From your firm Breasts th' important Secrets tear. If any treach'rous Brother of your own Shall to th' World divulge, &amp; make them known, Let him by worst of Deaths his Guilt attone. Should but his Thoughts, or Dreams suspected be, Let him for safety, and prevention die, And learn i'th' Grave the Art of Secresie. But one thing more, and then with joy I go, Nor as a longer stay of Fate below: Give me again once more your plighted Faith, And let each seal it with his dying breath: As the great Carthaginian heretofore The bloody reeking Altar touch'd, and swore Eternal Enmity to th' Roman Pow'r: Swear you (and let the Fates confirm the same) An endless Hatred to the Luth'ran Name: Vow never to admit, or League, or Peace, Or Truce, or Commerse with the cursed Race: Now, through all Age, when Time, or Place soe're Shall give you pow'r, wage an immortal War: Like Theban Feuds, let yours your selves survive, And in your very Dust, and Ashes live. Like mine, be your last Gasp their Curse.—At this They kneel, and all the Sacred Volumn kiss; Vowing to send each year an Hecatomb Of Huguenots, an Off'ring to his Tomb. In vain he would continue;—Abrupt Death A Period puts, and stops his impious Breath: In broken Accents he is scarce allow'd To faulter out his Blessing on the Crowd, Amen is eccho'd by Infernal Howl, And scrambling Spirits seize his parting Soul. SATYR IV. S. Ignatius his Image brought in, discovering the Rogueries of the Jesuits, and ridiculous Superstition of the Church of Rome. Once I was common Wood, a shapeless Log, Thrown out a Pissing-post for ev'ry Dog: The Workman yet in doubt, what course to take; Whether I'd best a Saint, er Hog-trough make, After debate resolv'd me for a Saint, And thus fam'd Loyola I represent: And well I may resemble him, for he As stupid was, as much a Block as I. My right Leg maim'd, at halt I seem to stand, To tell the Wounds at Pampelune sustein'd. My Sword, and Soldiers Armour here had been, But they may in Monserrats Church be seen: Those there to blessed Virgin I laid down For Cassock, Sursingle, and shaven Crown, The spiritual Garb, in which I now am shown. With due Accoutrements, and sit disguise I might for Centinel of Corn suffice: As once the well-hung God of old stood guard, And the invading Crows from Forrage scar'd. Now on my head the Birds their Relicks leave, And Spiders in my mouth their Arras weave: And persecuted Rats oft find in me A Refuge, and religious Sanctuary. But you profaner Hereticks, who e're The Inquisition, and its vengeance fear, I charge, stand off, at peril come not near: None at twelve score untruss, break wind, or piss; He enters Fox his Lists, that dare transgress: For I'm by Holy Church in Rev'rence had, And all good Cath'lick Folk implore my aid. These Pictures, which you see, my Story give, The Acts, and Monuments of me alive: That Frame, wherein with Pilgrims weeds I stand, Contains my Travels to the Holy Land. This me, and my Decemvirate at Rome, When I for Grant of my great Order come. There with Devotion rapt, I hang in Air, With Dove (like Mah'met's) whisp'ring in my ear. Here Virgin in Galesh of Clouds descends, To be my safeguard from assaulting Fiends. Those Tables by, and Crutches of the lame, My great Atchievements since my death proclaim: Pox, Ague, Dropsie, Palsie, Stone, and Gout, Legions, of Maladies by me cast out, More than the College know, or ever fill Quacks Wiping-paper, and the Weekly Bill. What Peter's shadow did of old, the same Is fancied done by my all-powerful Name; For which some wear't about their Necks, and Arms, To guard from Dangers, Sicknesses, and Harms; And some on Wombs the barren to relieve, A Miracle, I better did alive. Oft I by crafty Jesuit am taught Wonders to do, and many a Juggling Feat. Sometimes with Chasing-dish behind me put, I sweat like Clapt Debauch in Hot-House shut, And drip like any Spitch-cock'd Huguenot: Sometimes by secret Springs I learn to stir, As Paste-board Saints dance by mirac'lous Wire: Then I Tradescant's Rarities out-do, Sands Waterworks, and German Clockwork too, Or any choice Device at Barthol'mew. Sometimes I utter Oracles, by Priest Instead of a Familiar possest. The Church I vindicate, Luther confute, And cause amazement in the gaping Rout. Such holy Cheats, such Hocus Tricks, as these, For Miracles amongst the Rabble pass. By this in their esteem I daily grow, In Wealth inrich'd, increas'd in Vot'ries too. This draws each year vast Numbers to my Tomb, More than in Pigrimage to Mecca come. This brings each week new Presents to my Shrine, And makes it those of India Gods out-shine. This gives a Chalice, that a Golden Cross, Another massie Candlesticks bestows, Some Alter-cloaths of costly work, and price Plush, Tissue, Ermin, Silks of noblest Dies, The Birth, and Passion in Embroideries: Some Jewels, rich as those, th' Ægyptian Punk In Jellies to her Roman Stallion drunk, Some offer gorgeous Robes, which serve to wear When I on Holy days in state appear; When I'm in pomp on high Processions shown, Like Pageants of Lord May'r, or Skimmington Lucullus could not such a Wardrobe boast, Less those of Popes at their Election cost; Less those, which Sicily's Tyrant heretofore From Plunder'd Gods, and Jove's own Shoulders tore. Hither, as to some Fair, the Rabble come, To barter for the Merchandize of Rome; Where Priests, like Mountebanks, on Stage appear, T'expose the Frip'ry of their hallow'd Ware: This is the Lab'ratory of their Trade, The Shop, where all their staple Drugs are made; Prescriptions, and Receipts to bring in Gain, All from the Church Dispensatories ta 'en, The Pope's Elixir, Holy Waters here, Which they with Chymick Art distill'd prepare: Choice above Goddard's Drops, and all the Trash Of Modern Quacks; this is that Soveraign Wash For fetching Spots, and Morphew from the Face, And scowring dirty Cloaths, and Consciences. One drop of this, if us'd, had pow'r to fray The Legion from the Hogs of Gadara: This would have silenc'd quite the Wiltshire Drum, And made the prating Fiend of Mascon dumb. That Vessel consecrated Oyl contains, Kept Sacred, as the fam'd Ampoulle of France; Which some profaner Hereticks would use For liquoring Wheels of Jacks, of Boots, and Shooes: This make the Chrism, which mix'd with Snot of Priests, Anoint young Cath'licks for the Church's lists; And when they're crost, confest, and die; by this Their lanching Souls slide off to endless Bliss: As Lapland Saints, when they on Broomsticks fly, By help of Magick Unctions mount the Sky. Yon Altar-Pix of Gold is the Abode, And safe Repository of their God. A Cross is fix'd upon't the Feinds to fright, And Flies which would the Deity beshite; And Mice, which oft might unprepar'd receive. And to lewd Scoffers cause of Scandal give. Here are perform'd the Conjurings and Spells, For Christning Saints, and Hawks, and Carriers Bells; For hall'wing Shreds, and Grains, and Salts, and Bawms, Shrines, Crosses, Medals, Shells, and Waxen Lambs: Of wondrous Virtue all (you must believe) And from all sorts of Ill preservative; From Plague, Infection, Thunder, Storm, and Hail, Love, Grief, Want, Debt, Sin, and the Devil and all. Here Beads are blest, and Pater nosters fram'd, (By some the Tallies of Devotion nam'd) Which of their Pray'rs, and Oraisons keep tale, Lest they, and Heav'n should in the reck'ning fail. Here Sacred Lights, the Altars graceful Pride, Are by Priests breath perfum'd and Sanctified; Made some of Wax, of Her'ticks Tallow some, A Gift, which Irish Emma sent to Rome: For which great Merit worthily (we're told) She's now amongst her Country-Saints inroll'd. Here holy Banners are reserv'd in store, And Flags, such as the fam'd Armado bore: And hallow'd Swords, and Daggers kept for use, When resty Kings the Papal Yoke refuse: And consecrated Rats-bane, to be laid For Her'tick Vermin, which the Church invade. But that which brings in most of Wealth, and Gain, Does best the Priests swoln Tripes, and Purses strain; Here they each Week their constant Auctions hold Of Reliques, which by Candles Inch are sold: Saints by the dozen here are set to sale, Like Mortals wrought in Gingerbread on Stall. Hither are loads from emptied Channels brought, And Voiders of the Worms from Sextons bought; Which serve for Retail through the World to vent, Such as of late were to the Savoy sent: Hair from the Skulls of dying Strumpets shorn, And Felons Bones from rifled Gibbets torn; Like those, which some old Hag at midnight steals, For Witchcrafts, Amulets, and Charms, and Spells, Are past for Sacred to the Cheap'ning Rout; And worn on Fingers, Breasts, and Ears about. This boasts a Scrap of me, and that a Bit Of good St. George, St. Patrick, or St. Kit. These Locks S. Bridget's were, and those S. Clare's; Some for S. Catharine's go, and some for her's That wip'd her Saviour's feet, wash'd with her tears. Here you may see my wounded Leg, and here Those, which to China bore the great Xavier. Here may you the grand Traitor's Halter see, Some call't the Arms of the Society: Here is his Lanthorn too, but Faux his, not, That was embezl'd by the Huguenot. Here Garnet's Straws, and Becket's Bones, and Hair, For murd'ring whom, some Tails are said to wear; As learned Capgrave does record their fate, And faithful British Histories relate. Those are S. Laurence Coals expos'd to view, Strangely preserv'd, and kept alive till now. That's the fam'd Wildefortis wondrous Beard, For which her Maidenhead the Tyrant spar'd. Yon is the Baptist's Coat, and one of's Heads, The rest are shewn in many a place besides; And of his Teeth as many Sets there are, As on their Belts six Operators wear. Here Blessed Mary's Milk, not yet turn'd sour, Renown'd (like Ass'es) for its healing pow'r, Ten Holland Kine scarce in a year give more. Here is her Manteau, and a Smock of hers, Fellow to that, which once reliev'd Poictiers: Besides her Husbands Utensils of Trade, Wherewith some prove, that Images were made. Here is the Soldiers Spear, and Passion-Nails, Whose quantity would serve for building Pauls: Chips, some from Holy Cross, from Tyburn some, Honour'd by many a Jesuit's Martyrdom: All held of special, and Mirac'lous Pow'r, Not Tabor more approv'd for Agu's cure: Here Shooes, which, once perhaps at Newgate hung, Angled their Charity, that pass'd along, Now for S. Peter's go, and th' Office bear For Priests, they did for lesser Villains there. These are the Fathers Implements, and Tools, Their gawdy Trangums for inveigling Fools: These serve for Baits the simple to ensnare, Like Children spirited with Toys at Fair. Nor are they half the Artifices yet, By which the Vulgar they delude, and cheat: Which should I undertake, much easier I, Much sooner might compute what Sins there be Wip'd off, and pardon'd at a Jubilee. What Bribes enrich the Datary each year, Or Vices treated on by Escobar: How many Whores in Rome profess the Trade, Or greater numbers by Confession made. One undertakes by Scale of Miles to tell The Bounds, Dimensions, and Extent of Hell; How far, and wide th' Infernal Monarch Reigns, How many German Leagues his Realm contains: Who are his Ministers, pretends to know, And all their several Offices below: How many Chaudrons he each year expends In Coals for roasting Huguenots, and Feinds: And with as much exactness states the case, As if had been Surveyor of the place. Another frights the Rout with ruful Stories, Of Wild Chimæra's, Limbo's, Purgatories, And bloated Souls in smoaky durance hung, Like a Westphalia Gammon, or Neats Tongue, To be redeem'd with Masses, and a Song. A good round Sum must the Deliv'rance buy, For none may there swear out on poverty. Your rich, and bounteous Shades are only eas'd, No Fleet, or Kings-Bench Ghosts are thence releas'd. A third, the wicked, and debauch'd to please, Cries up the vertue of Indulgences, And all the rates of Vices does assess; What price they in the holy Chamber bear, And Customs for each Sin imported there: How you at best advantages may buy Patents for Sacrilege, and Simony. What Tax is in the Leach'ry-Office laid On Panders, Bawds, and Whores, that ply the Trade: What costs a Rape, or Incest, and how cheap You may an Harlot, or an Ingle keep; How easie Murder may afforded be For one, two, three, or a whole Family; But not of Her'ticks; there no Pardon lacks, 'Tis one o'th' Church's meritorious Acts. For venial Trifles, less and slighter Faults, They ne're deserve the trouble of your thoughts. Ten Ave Maries mumbled to the Cross Clear scores of twice ten thousand such as those: Some are at sound of christen'd Bell forgiven, And some by squirt of Holy Water driven: Others by Anthems plaid are charm'd away, As Men cure Bites of the Tarantula. But nothing with the Crowd does more enhance The value of these holy Charlatans, Than when the Wonders of the Mass they veiw, Where spiritual Jugglers their chief Mast'ry shew: Hey Jingo, Sirs! What's this? 'tis Bread you see; Presto be gone! 'tis now a Deity. Two grains of Dough, with Cross, and stamp of Priest, And five small words pronounc'd, make up their Christ. To this they all fall down, this all adore, And strait devour, what they ador'd before; Down goes the tiny Saviour at a bit, To be digested, and at length beshit: From Altar to Close-Stool, or Jakes preferr'd, First Wafer, then a God, and then a ? 'Tis this, that does the astonish'd Rout amuse, And Reverence to shaven Crown infuse: To see a silly, sinful, mortal Wight His Maker make, create the Infinite. None boggles at th' impossibility; Alas, 'tis wondrous Heavenly Mystery! None dares the mighty God-maker blaspheme, Nor his most open Crimes, and Vices blame: Saw he those hands that held his God before, Strait grope himself, and by and by a Whore: Should they his aged Father kill, or worse, His Sisters, Daughters, Wife, himself too force. And here I might (if I but durst) reveal What pranks are plaid in the Confessional: How haunted Virgins have been dispossest, And Devils were cast out, to let in Priest: What Fathers act with Novices alone, And what to Punks in shrievings Seats is done; Who thither flock to Ghostly Confessor, To clear old debts, and tick with Heav'n for more. Oft have I seen these hallow'd Altars stain'd With Rapes, those Pews with Buggeries profan'd: Not great Cellier, nor any greater Bawd, Of note, and long experience in the Trade, Has more, and fouler Scenes of Lust suvey'd. But I these dang'rous Truths forbear to tell, For fear I should the Inquisition feel. Should I tell all their countless Knaveries, Their Cheats, and Shams, and Forgeries, and Lies. Their Cringings, Crossings, Censings, Sprinklings, Chrisms, Their Conjurings, and Spells, and Exorcisms; Their Motly Habits, Maniples, and Stoles, Albs, Ammits, Rochets, Chimers, Hoods, and Cowls. Should I tell all their several Services, Their Trentals, Masses, Dirges, Rosaries; Their solemn Pomps, their Pageants, and Parades, Their holy Masks, and spiritual Cavalcades, With thousand Antick Tricks, and Gambols more; 'Twould swell the sum to such a mighty score, That I at length should more volum'nous grow, Than Crabb, or Surius, lying Fox, or Stow. Believe what e're I have related here, As true, as if 'twere spoke from Porph'ry Chair. If I have feign'd in ought, or broach'd a Lie, Let worst of Fates attend me, let me be Pist on by Porter, Groom, and Oyster-whore, Or find my Grave in Jakes, and Common-shore: Or make next Bonfire for the Powder-Plot, The sport of every sneering Huguenot. There like a Martyr'd Pope in Flames expire, And no kind Catholick dare quench the Fire. ODE. Aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris, &amp; carcere dignum, Si vis esse aliquis.? Juven. Sat. 1. Now Curses on you all! ye vertuous Fools, Who think to fetter free-born souls, And tie 'em to dull Morality, and rules. The Sagarite be damn'd, and all the Crew Of learned Ideots, who his steps pursue; And those more silly Proselytes, whom his fond precepts drew. Oh! had his Ethicks been with their wild Author drown'd, Or a like Fate with those lost Writings found, Which that grand Plagiary doom'd to fire, And made by unjust Flames expire: They ne're had then seduc'd Mortality, Ne're lasted to debauch the World with their lewd Pedantry. But damn'd, and more (if Hell can do't) be that thrice cursed name, Who e're the Rudiments of Law design'd; Who e're did the first Model of Religion frame, And by that double Vassalage enthrall'd Mankind, By nought before, but their own Pow'r, or Will confin'd: Now quite abridg'd of all their Primitive Liberty, And slaves to each capricious Monarch's Tyranny. More happy Brutes! who the great Rule of Sense observe, And ne're from their first Charter swerve. Happy! whose lives are meerly to enjoy, And feel no stings of Sin, which may their bliss annoy. Still unconcern'd at Epithets of ill, or good, Distinctions, unadult'rate Nature never understood. 2. Hence hated Virtue from our goodly Isle, No more our joys beguile; No more with thy loath'd presence plague our happy state, Thou enemy to all, that's brisk, or gay, or brave or great. Be gone with all thy pious meagre Train, To some unfruitful, unfrequented Land, And there an Empire gain, And there extend thy rigorous command: There where illib'ral Nature's niggardise Has set a Tax on Vice. Where the lean barren Region does enhance The worth of dear Intemperance, And for each pleasurable sin exacts excise. We (thanks to Fate) more cheaply can offend, And want no tempting Luxuries, No good convenient sinning opportunities; Which Nature's bounty could bestow, or Heaven's kindness lend. Go follow that nice Goddess to the Skies, Who heretofore disgusted at increasing Vice, Dislik'd the World, and thought it too profane, And timely hence retir'd, and kindly ne're return'd again. Hence to those Airy Mansions rove, Converse with Saints, and holy folks above; Those may thy presence woo, Whose lazy ease affords them nothing else to do: Where haughty scornful I, And my great Friends will ne're vouchsafe thee company. Thou'rt now an hard, unpracticable good, Too difficult for flesh and blood: Were I all soul, like them, perhaps I'd learn to practise thee. 3. Vertue! thou solemn grave impertinence, Abhorr'd by all the Men of Wit, and Sense: Thoudamn'd Fatigue! that clogst life's journey here, Though thou no weight of wealth or profit bear; Thou purling fond Green-sickness of the mind! That mak'st us prove to our own selves unkind, Whereby we Coals, and Dirt for diet chuse, And, Pleasur's better food refuse. Curst Jilt! that lead'st deluded Mortals on, Till they too late perceive themselves undone, Chous'd by a Dowry in reversion. The greatest Votary, thou e 'e could boast, (Pity so brave a Soul was on thy service lost; What Wonders he in wickedness had done, Whom thy weak pow'r could so inspire alone?) Tho long with fond amours he courted thee, Yet dying, did recant his vain Idolatry: At length, though late, he did repent with shame, Forc'd to confess thee nothing, but an empty name. So was that Lecher gull'd, whose haughty love Design'd a Rape on the Queen Regent of the Gods above: When he a Goddess thought he had in chace He found a gaudy vapour in the place, And with thin Air beguil'd his starv'd embrace. Idly he spent his vigour, spent his blood, And tyr'd himself t'oblige an unperforming Cloud. 4. If Humane kind to thee e're Worship paid; They were by ignorance misled, That only them devout, and thee a Goddess made. Known haply in the Worlds rude untaught infancy, Before it had out-grown its childish innocence, Before it had arriv'd at sense, Or reach'd the Man-hood, and discretion of Debauchery; Known in those antient goodly duller times, When crafty Pagans had engross'd all crimes: When Christian Fools were obstinately good, Nor yet their Gospel-freedom understood. Tame easie Fops! who could so prodigally bleed, To be thought Saints, and dye a Calendar with with red: No prudent Heathen e're seduc'd could be, To suffer Martyrdom for thee: Only that arrant Ass whom the false Oracle call'd Wise (No wonder if the Devil utter'd lies) That sniveling Puritan, who spite of all the mode Would be unfashionably good, And exercis'd his whining gifts to rail at Vice: Him all the Wits of Athens damn'd, And justly with Lampoons defam'd: But when the mad Fanatick, could not silenc'd be From broaching dang'rous Divinity; The wise Republick made him for prevention die, And sent him to the Gods, and better company. 5. Let fumbling Age be grave, and wise, And Vertue's poor contemn'd Idea prize, Who never knew, or now are past the sweets of Vice; While we whose active pulses beat With lusty youth, and vigorous heat, Can all their Beards, and Morals too despise, While my plump veins are fill'd with lust and blood; Let not one thought of her intrude, Or dare appoach my brest, But know 'tis all possest By a more welcome guest: And know, I have not yet the leisure to be good. If ever unkind destiny Shall force long life on me; If e're I must the curse of dotage bear; Perhaps I'll dedicate those dregs of Time to her, And come with Crutches her most humble Votary. When sprightly Vice retreats from hence, And quits the ruins of decayed sense; She'l serve to usher in a fair pretence, And varnish with her name a well-dissembled impotence, When Ptisick, Rheums, Catarrhs, and Palsies seize, And all the Bill of Maladies, Which Heaven to punish over-living Mortals sends; Then let her enter with the numerous infirmities, Her self the greatest plague, which wrinkles, and grey hairs attends. 6. Tell me, ye Venerable Sots, who court her most, What small advantage can she boast, Which her great Rival hath not in a greater store ingrost. Her boasted calm, and peace of mind In Wine, and Company we better find, Find it with Pleasure too combin'd. In mighty Wine, where we our senses steep, And Lull our Cares, and Consciences asleep: But why do I that wild Chimæra name? Conscience! that giddy airy Dream, Which does from brain sick heads, or ill-digesting stomachs steam. Conscience! the vain fantastick fear Of punishments, we know not when, nor where: Project of crafty Statesmen to support weak Law, Whereby they slavish Spirits awe, And dastard Souls to forc'd obedience draw. Grand Wheadle! which our Gown'd Impostors use, The poor unthinking Rabble to abuse. Scarecrow! to fright from the forbidden fruit of Vice, Their own beloved Paradise: Let those vile Canters wickedness decry, Whose Mercenary tongues take pay For what they say; And yet commend in practice what their words deny, While we discerning Heads, who farther pry, Their holy Cheats defie And scorn their Frauds, and scorn their sanctified Cajoulery. 7. None but dull unbred Fools discredit Vice, Who act their wickedness with an ill grace; Such their profession scandalize, And justly forfeit all that praise; All that esteem, that credit, and applause, Which we by our wise menage from a sin can raise. A true, and brave transgressor ought To sin with the same height of spirit, Cæsar fought: Mean-soul'd offenders now no honours gain, Only debauches of the nobler strain. Vice well-improv'd yields bliss, and fame beside, And some for sinning have been deifi'd. Thus the lewd Gods of old did move, By these brave methods to the seats above. Ev'n Jove himself, the Sovereign Deity, Father and King of all th' immortal Progeny, Ascended to that high Degree; By crimes above the reach of weak Mortality. He Heav'n one large Seraglio made, Each Goddess turn'd a glorious Punk o'th trade; And all that Sacred place Was fill'd with Bastard Gods of his own race: Almighty Lech'ry got his first repute, And everlasting Whoring was his chiefest Attribute. 8. How gallant was that Wretch, whose happy guilt A Fame upon the Ruins of a Temple built! ‘Let Fools, said he, Impiety alledg, ‘And urge the no great fault of Sacriledg: ‘I'll set the Sacred Pile on flame, ‘And in its Ashes write my lasting Name, ‘My name which thus shall be ‘Deathless as its own Deity. ‘Thus the vain-glorious Carian I'll out-do, ‘And Egypts proudest Monarchs too; ‘Those lavish Prodigals, who idly did consume ‘Their Lives, and Treasures to erect a Tomb, ‘And only great by being buried would become: ‘At cheaper rates than they I'll buy renown, ‘And my loud Fame shall all their silent glories drown. So spake the daring Hector, so did Prophesie: And so it prov'd: in vain did envious Spite By fruitless methods try To raze his well-built Fame, and Memory Amongst Posterity: The Boutefeu can now Immortal write, While the inglorious Founder is forgotten quite. 9. Yet greater was that mighty Emperor; (A greater crime besitted his high Pow'r) Who sacrific'd a City to a Jest, And shew'd he knew the grand intrigues of humor best: He made all Rome a Bonefire to his Fame, And sung, and play'd, and danc'd amidst the Flame; Bravely begun! yet pity there he stay'd, One step to Glory more he should have made: He should have heav'd the noble frolick higher, And made the People on that Fun'ral pile expire Or providently with their blood put out the Fire. Had this been done, The utmost pitch of glory he had won: No greater Monument could be To consecrate him to eternity, Nor should there need another Herald of his praise, but me. 10. And thou, yet greater Faux, the glory of our Isle, Whom baffled Hell esteems its chiefest Foyl; 'Twere injury should I omit thy name Whose Action merits all the breath of Fame. Methinks, I see the trembling shades below Around in humble reverence bow; Doubtful they seem, whether to pay their Loyalty To their dread Monarch, or to thee: No wonder he (grown jealous of thy fear'd success) Envy'd Mankind the honour of thy wickedness, And spoil'd that brave attempt, which must have made his grandeur less. How e're regret not, mighty Ghost, Thy Plot by treach'rous fortune crost, Nor think thy well deserved glory lost. Thou the full praise of Villany shalt ever share, And all will judge thy Act, compleat enough, when thou could'st dare, So thy great Master far'd, whose high disdain Contemn'd that Heaven, where he could not Reign, When he with bold Ambition strove T'usurp the Throne above, And led against the Deity an armed Train, Tho from his vast designs he fell, O're-power'd by his Almighty Foe, Yet gain'd he Victory in his overthrow: He gain'd sufficient Triumph, that he durst Rebel, And 'twas some pleasure to be thought the great'st in Hell. 11. Tell me, you great Triumvirate, what shall I do To be illustrious as you? Let your examples move me with a gen'rous fire, Let them into my daring thoughts inspire Somewhat compleatly wicked, some vast Gyant-crime, Unknown, unheard, unthought of by all past and present time. 'Tis done, 'tis done; Methinks, I feel the pow'rful charms, And a new heat of sin my spirit warms; I travel with a glorious mischief, for whose birth, My Soul's too narrow, and weak Fate too feeble to bring forth. Let the unpitied Vulgar tamely go, And stock for company, the wild Plantations down below: Such their vile Souls for viler Barter sell, Scarce worth the damning, or their room in Hell. We are his Grandees, and expect as much preferment there, For our good Service, as on Earth we share. In them sin is but a meer privative of good, The frailty, and defect of flesh and blood: In us 'tis a perfection, who profess A studied, and elaborate wickedness. We are the great Royal Society of Vice, Whose Talents are to make discoveries, And advance Sin like other Arts, and Sciences. 'Tis I the bold Columbus only I, Who must new Worlds in Vice descry, And fix the pillars of unpassable iniquity. 12. How sneaking was the first debauch that sin'd Who for so small a Crime sold humane kind! How undeserving that high place, To be thought Parent of our sin, and race, Who by low guilt our Nature doubly did debase! Unworthy was he to be thought Father of the great first born Cain, which he begot; The noble Cain, whose bold, and gallant act Proclaim'd him of more high extract: Unworthy me, And all the braver part of his Posterity. Had the just Fates design'd me in his stead; I'd done some great, and unexampled deed: A deed, which should decry The Stoicks dull Equality, And shew that sin admits transcendency: A deed, wherein the Tempter should not share Above what Heav'n could punish, and above what he could dare. For greater crimes than his I would have fell, And acted somewhat, which might merit more than Hell. An Apology for the foregoing Ode, by way of Epilogue. My part is done, and you'l, I hope, excuse Th' extravagance of a repenting Muse, Pardon what e're she hath too boldly said, She only acted here in Masquerade. For the slight Arguments she did produce, Were not to flatter Vice, but to traduce. So we Buffoons in Princely dress expose, Not to be gay, but more ridiculous. When she an Hector for her Subject had, She thought she must be Termagant, and mad: That made her speak like a lewd Punk o'th' Town, Who by converse with Bullies wicked grown, Has learn'd the Mode to cry all Virtue down. But now the Vizard's off; she changes Scene, And turns a modest civil Girl agen. Our Poet has a different taste of Wit, Nor will to common Vogue himself submit. Let some admire the Fops whose Talents lie In venting dull insipid Blasphemy; He swears he cannot with those terms dispense, Nor will be damn'd for the repute of sense. Wit's name was never to profaneness due, For then you see he could be witty too: He could Lampoon the State, and Libel Kings, But that he's Loyal, and knows better things, Than Fame, whose guilty Birth from Treason springs. He likes not Wit, which can't a Licence claim, To which the Author dares not set his Name. Wit should be open, court each Reader's eye, Not lurk in sly unprinted privacy. But Crim'nal Writers like dull Birds of Night, For weakness, or for shame avoid the light; May such a Jury for their Audience have, And from the Bench, not Pit, their doom receive. May they the Tow'r for their due merits share, And a just wreath of Hemp, not Laurel wear: He could be Bawdy too, and nick the times, In what they dearly love; Damn'd placket Rhimes, Such as our Nobles write— Whose nauseous Poetry can reach no higher Than what the Codpiece, or its God inspire. So lewd, they spend at quill, you'd justly think; They wrote with something nastier than Ink. But he still thought that little Wit, or none, Which a just modesty must never own, And a meer Reader with a Blush attone. If Ribauldry deserv'd the praise of Wit, He must resign to each illit'rate Citt, And Prentices, and Car-men challenge it. Ev'n they too can be smart, and witty there; For all men on that Subject Poets are. Henceforth he vows, if ever more he find Himself to the base itch of Verse inclin'd; If e're he's given up so far to write; He never means to make his end delight: Should he do so; he must despair success: For he's not now debauch'd enough to please, And must be damn'd for want of Wickedness. He'l therefore use his Wit another way, And next the ugliness of Vice display. Tho against Vertue once he drew his Pen, He'l ne're for ought, but her defence agen. Had he a Genius, and Poetick rage, Great as the Vices of this guilty Age. Were he all Gall, and arm'd with store of spight; 'Twere worth his pains to undertake to write; To noble Satyr he'd direct his aim, And by't Mankind, and Poetry reclaim, He'd shoot his Quills just like a Porcupine At Vice, and make them stab in every Line, The world should learn to blush,— And dread the Vengeance of his pointed Wit, Which worse than their own Consciences should fright, And all should think him Heav'ns just Plague, design'd To visit for the sins of lewd Mankind. THE Passion of Byblis OUT OF Ovid's Metamorphosis, B. 9. F. 11. Beginning at Byblis in exemplo est, ut ament concessa puellæ. And ending with ? Modumque Exit, &amp; infelix committit sæpe repelli. You heedless Maids, whose young, and tender hearts Unwounded yet, have scap'd the fatal darts; Let the sad tale of wretched Byblis move, And learn by her to shun forbidden Love, Not all the plenty, all the bright resort Of gallant Youth, that grac'd the Carian Court, Could charm the hauty Nymph's disdainful heart, Or from a Brother's guilty Love divert; Caunus she lov'd, not as a Sister ought, But Honour, Blood, and Shame alike forgot: Caunus alone takes up her Thoughts, and Eyes, For him alone she wishes, grieves and sighs. At first her new-born Passion owns no name, A glim'ring Spark scarce kindling into flame; She thinks it no offence, if from his Lip She snatch an harmless bliss, if her fond clip With loose embraces oft his Neck surround, And Love is yet in debts of Nature drown'd. But Love at length grows naughty by degrees, And now she likes, and strives her self to please: Well-drest she comes, &amp; arms her Eyes with darts, Her Smiles with charms, and all the studied arts Which practis'd Love can teach to vanquish hearts. Industrious now, she labours to be fair, And envies all, whoever fairer are. Yet knows she not, she loves, but still does grow, Insensibly the thing, she does not know: Strict honour yet her check'd desires does bind, And modest thoughts, on this side wish confin'd: Only within she sooths her pleasing flames, And now, the hated terms of Blood disclaims: Brother sounds harsh; she the unpleasing word Strives to forget, and oftner calls him Lord: And when the name of Sister grates her ear, Could wish't unsaid, and rather Byblis hear. Nor dare she yet with waking thoughts admit A wanton hope: but when returning night With Sleep's soft gentle spell her Senses charms, Kind fancy often brings him to her Arms: In them she oft does the lov'd Shadow seem To grasp, and joys, yet blushes too in Dream. She wakes, and long in wonder silent lies, And thinks on her late pleasing Extasies: Now likes, and now abhors her guilty flame, By turns abandon'd to her Love, and Shame: At length her struggling thoughts an utt'rance find, And vent the wild disorders of her mind. “Ah me! (she cries) kind Heaven avert! what means “This boading form, that nightly rides my dreams? “Grant 'em untrue! why should lewd hope divine? “Ah! why was this too charming Vision seen? “'Tis true, by the most envious wretch, that sees, “He's own'd all fair, and lovely, own'd a prize, “Worthy the conquest of the brightest eyes: “A prize that wou'd my high'st Ambition fill, “All I could wish;—but he's my brother still! “That cruel word for ever must disjoyn, “Nor can I hope, but thus, to have him mine. “Since then I waking never must possess; “Let me in sleep at least enjoy the bliss, “And sure nice Vertue can't forbid me this: “Kind sleep does no malicious spies admit, “Yet yields a lively semblance of delight: “Gods! what a scene of joy was that! how fast “I clasp'd the Vision to my panting breast! “With what fierce bounds I sprung to meet my bliss, “While my rapt soul flew out in every kiss! “Till breathless, faint, and softly sunk away, “I all dissolv'd in reeking pleasures lay! “How sweet is the remembrance yet! though night “Too hasty fled, drove on by envious light. “O that we might the Laws of Nature break! “How well would Caunus me an Husband make! “How well to Wife might he his Byblis take! “Wou'd God! in all things we had partners bin “Besides our Parents, and our fatal Kin: “Wou'd thou wert nobler, I more meanly born, “Then guiltless I'd despair'd, and suffer'd scorn: “Happy that Maid unknown, whoe're shall prove “so blest, so envied to deserve thy love. “Unhappy me! whom the same womb did joyn, “Which now forbids me ever to be thine: “Curst fate! that we alone in that agree, “By which we ever must divided be. “And must we be? what meant my Vision then? “Are they, and all their dear presages vain? “Have Dreams no credit, but with easie love? “Or do they hit sometimes, and faithful prove? “The Gods forbid! yet those whom I invoke, “Have lov'd like me, have their own Sisters took: “Great Saturn, and his greater Off-spring Jove, “Both stock'd their Heaven with Incestuous love: “Gods have their priviledge: why do I strive “To strain my Hopes to their Prerogative? “No, let me banish this forbidden fire, “Or quench it with my Blood, and with't expire: “Unstain'd in honour, and unhurt in fame, “Let the Grave bury my Love, and Shame: “But when at my last hour I gasping lie, “Let only my kind Murderer be by: “Let him, while I breath out my soul in sighs, “Or gaz't away, look on with pitying eyes: “Let him (for sure he can't deny me this) “Seal my cold Lips with one dear parting Kiss. “Besides, 'twere vain should I alone agree “To what anothers Will must ratifie; “Cou'd I be so abandon'd to consent; “What I have pass for good and innocent, “He may perhaps as worst of Crimes resent. “Yet we amongst our Race examples find “Of Brothers, who have been to Sisters kind: “Fam'd Canace cou'd thus successful prove, “Cou'd Crown her wishes in a Brother's love. “But whence cou'd I these instances produce? “How came I witty to my ruin thus? “Whither will this mad frenzy hurry on? “Hence, hence, you naughty flames, far hence be gone, “Nor let me e're the shameful Passion own. “And yet shou'd he address; I shou'd forgive, “I fear, I fear, I shou'd his suit receive: “Shall therefore I, who cou'd not love disown “Offer'd by him, not mine to make him known? “And canst thou speak? can thy bold tongue declare? “Yes, Love shall force:—and now methinks I dare. “But lest fond modesty at length refuse, “I will some sure, and better method chuse: “A Letter shall my secret flames disclose, “And hide my Blushes, but reveal their cause. This takes, and 'tis resolv'd as soon as said, With this she rais'd her self upon her bed, And propping with her hand her leaning head: “Happen what will (says she) I'll make him know “What pains, what raging pains I undergo: “Ah me! I rave! what tempests shake my breast? “And where? O where will this distraction rest? Trembling, her Thoughts endite, and oft her Eye Looks back for fear of conscious spies too nigh: One hand her Paper, t'other holds her Pen, And Tears supply that Ink her Lines must drain. Now she begins, now stops, and stopping frames New doubts, now writes, and now her writing damns. She writes, defaces, alters, likes, and blames: Oft throws in hast her Pen, and Paper by, Then takes 'em up again as hastily: Unsteddy her resolves, fickle, and vain, No sooner made, but strait unmade again: What her desires would have, she does not know, Displeas'd with all, what e're she goes to do: At once contending, shame, and hope, and fear, Wrack her tost mind, and in her looks appear. Sister was wrote; but soon misguiding doubt Recalls it, and the guilty word blots out. Again she pauses, and again begins, At length her Pen drops out these hasty Lines. “Kind health, which you, and only you can grant. “Which, if deny'd, she must for ever want; “To you your Lover sends: ah! blushing Shame “In silence bids her Paper hide her name: “Wou'd God the fatal Message might be done “Without annexing it, nor Byblis known, “E're blest success her hopes, and wishes crown. “And had I now my smother'd greif conceal'd, “It might by tokens past have been reveal'd: “A thousand proofs were ready to impart “The inward anguish of my wounded heart: “Oft, as your sight a sudden blush did raise, “My blood came up to meet you at my face: “Oft (if you call to mind) my longing Eyes “Betray'd in looks my souls too thin disguise: “Think how their Tears, think how my heaving Breast “Oft in deep sighs some cause unknown confest: “Think how these Arms did oft with fierce embrace, “Eager as my desires, about you press: “These Lips too, when they cou'd so happy prove, “(Had you but mark'd) with close warm kisses strove “To whisper something more than Sisters Love. “And yet, though rankling grief my mind distrest, “Tho raging flames within burn up my breast, “Long time I did the mighty pain endure, “Long strove to bring the fierce disease to cure: “Witness, ye cruel Pow'rs, who did inspire “This strange, this fatal, this resistless fire, “Witness, what pains (for you alone can know) “This helpless wretch to quench't did undergo: “A thousand Racks, and Martyrdoms, and more “Than a weak Virgin can be thought, I bore: “O'rematch'd in pow'r at last, I'm forc'd to yield, “And to the conqu'ring God resign the field: “To you, dear cause of all, I make address, “From you with humble pray'rs I beg redress: “You rule alone my arbitrary fate, “And life, and death on your disposal wait: “Ordain, as you think fit; deny, or grant, “Yet know no stranger is your suppliant. “But she, who, tho to you by Blood allied “In nearest bonds, in nearer wou'd be tied. “Let doting age debate of Law, and Right, “And gravely state the bounds of just, and fit; “Whose Wisdom's but their Envy, to destroy “And bar those pleasures, which they can't enjoy: “Our blooming years, more sprightly, and more gay, “By Nature we're design'd for love and play: “Youth knows no check, but leaps weak Vertu's fence, “And briskly hunts the noble chase of Sense: “Without dull thinking we enjoyment trace, “And call that lawful, whatsoe're does please. “Nor will our guilt want instances alone, “'Tis what the glorious Gods above have done: “Let's follow where those great examples went, “Nor think that Sin, where Heaven's a precedent. “Let neither awe of Fathers frowns, nor shame “For ought that can be told by blabbing fame “Nor any gastlier fantom, fear can frame, “Frighten or stop us in our way to bliss, “But boldly let us rush on happiness: “Where glorious hazards shall enhanse delight, “And that, that makes it dangerous, make it great: “Relation too, which does our fault increase, “Will serve that fault the better to disguise? “That lets us now in private often meet “Bless'd opportunities for stoln delight: “In publick often we embrace, and kiss, “And fear no jealous, no suspecting eyes. “How little more remains for me to crave! “How little more for you to give! O save “A wretched Maid undone by Love, and you, “Who does in tears, and dying accents sue; “Who bleeds that Passion, she had ne're reveal'd, “If not by Love, Almighty Love compell'd: “Nor ever let her mournful Tomb complain, “Here Byblis lies, kill'd by your cold disdain. Here forc'd to end, for want of room, not will To add, her lines the crowded Margin fill, Nor space allow for more: she trembling, folds The Paper, which her shameful Message holds; And sealing, as she wept with boading fear, She wet her Signet with a falling Tear. This done, a trusty Messenger she call'd, And in kind words the whisper'd Errand told: “Go, carry this with faithful care, she said, “To my dear,—there she paus'd a while, and staid, And by and by—Brother—was heard to add: As she deliver'd it with her commands, The Letter fell from out her trembling hands, Dismay'd with the ill Omen, she anew Doubted success, and held, yet bad him go. He goes, and after quick admission got To Caunus hands the fatal secret brought: Soon as the doubtful Youth a glance had cast On the first lines, and guest by them the rest, Strait horror, and amazement fill'd his breast: Impatient with his rage, he could not stay To see the end, but threw't half read away. Scarce could his hands the trembling wretch forbear, Nor did his tongue those angry threatnings spare: “Fly hence, nor longer my chaf'd fury trust, “Thou cursed Pander of detested Lust; “Fly quickly hence, and to thy swiftness owe “Thy life, a forfeit to my vengeance due: “Which, had not danger of my Honour crost, “Thou'dst paid by this, and been sent back a Ghost, He the rough orders strait obeys, and bears The killing news to wretched Byblis ears; Like striking Thunder the fierce tidings stun, And to her heart quicker than lightning run: The frighted blood forsakes her ghastly face, And a short death doth every Member seize: But soon as sense returns, her frenzy too Returns, and in these words breaks forth anew. “And justly serv'd;—for why did foolish I “Consent to make this rash discovery? “Why did I thus in hasty lines reveal “That dang'rous secret, Honour wou'd conceal? “I shou'd have first with art disguis'd the hook, “And seen how well the gawdy bait had took, “And found him hung at least before I strook: “From shore I shou'd have first descri'd the wind “Whether 'twould prove to my adventure kind, “E're I to untry'd Seas my self resign'd: “Now dash'd on Rocks, unable to retire, “I must i'th wreck of all my hopes expire, “And was not I by tokens plain enough “Fore-warn'd to quit my inauspicious Love? “Did not the Fates my ill success foretell, “When from my hands th' unhappy Letter fell? “So should my hopes have done, and my design, “That, or the day should then have alter'd been; “But rather the unlucky day; when Heaven “Such ominous proofs of its dislike had given: “And so it had, had not mad Passion sway'd, “And Reason been by blinder Love misled. “Besides (alas!) I shou'd my self have gone, “Nor made my Pen a proxy to my Tongue; “Much more I cou'd have spoke, much more have told, “Than a short Letter's narrow room would hold: “He might have seen my looks, my wishing Eyes “My melting Tears, and heard my begging Sighs; “About his Neck I could have flung my Arms, “And been all over Love, all over Charms; “Grasp'd, and hung on his Knees, and there have dyed, “There breath'd my gasping Soul out, if denied: “This and ten thousand things I might have done “To make my Passion with advantage known; “Which if they each could not have bent his mind, “Yet surely all had forc'd him to be kind. “Perhaps he, whom I sent, was too in fault, “Nor rightly tim'd his Message, as he ought; “I fear he went in some ill-chosen hour, “When cloudy weather made his temper lour. “Not those calm seasons of the mind, which prove, “The fittest to receive the seeds of Love; “These things have ruin'd me; for doubtless he “Is made of humane flesh, and blood, like me; “He suck'd no Tygress sure, nor Mountain Bear, “Nor does his Breast relentless Marble wear. “He must, he shall consent, again I'll try, “And try again, if he again deny: “No scorn, no harsh repulse, or rough defeat “Shall ever my desire, or hopes rebate. “My earnest suits shall never give him rest, “While Life, and Love more durable, shall last: “Alive I'll press, till breath in pray'rs be lost, “And after come a kind beseeching Ghost. “For, if I might, what I have done, recall, “The first point were, not to have don't at all; “But since 'tis done, the second to be gain'd “Is now to have, what I have sought, attain'd: “For he, though I should now my wishes quit, “Can never my unchast attempts forget: “Should I desist, 'twill be believ'd that I “By slightly asking, taught him to deny; “Or that I tempted him with wily fraud, “And snares for his unwary honour laid: “Or, what I sent (and the belief were just) “Were not th' efforts of Love, but shameful Lust. “In fine, I now dare any thing that's ill; “I've writ, I have solicited, my will “Has been debauch'd; and shou'd I thus give out, “I cannot chast, and innocent be thought: “Much there is wanting still to be fulfill'd, “Much to my wish, but little to my guilt. She spoke; but such is her unsetled mind, It shifts from thought to thought, like veering wind, Now to this point, and now to that inclin'd: What she could wish had unattempted been: She strait is eager to attempt agen: What she repents, she acts; and now lets loose The reins to Love, nor any bounds allows, Repulse upon repulse umov'd she bears, And still sues on, while she her suit despairs. A SATYR Upon a WOMAN, who by her Falshood and Scorn was the Death of my Friend. No she shall ne're escape, if Gods there be, Unless they perjur'd grow, and false as she; Though no strange Judgment yet the Murd'ress seize To punish her, and quit the partial Skies: Though no revenging lightning yet has flasht From thence, that might her criminal beauties blast: Tho they in their old lustre still prevail, By no disease, nor guilt it self made pale. Guilt, which should blackest Moors themselves but own, Would make through all their night new blushes dawn: Though that kind soul, who now augments the blest, Thither too soon by her unkindness chas'd. (Where may it be her small'st, and lightest doom, (For that's not half my curse) never to come) Though he, when prompted by the high'st despair, Ne're mention'd her without an Hymn, or Prayer, And could by all her scorn be forc'd no more Than Martyrs to revile what they adore. Who, had he curst her with his dying breath; Had done but just, and Heaven had forgave: Tho ill-made Law no Sentence has ordain'd For her, no Statute has her Guilt arraign'd. (For Hangmen, Womens Scorn, and Doctors skill, All by a licenc'd way of murder kill.) Tho she from Justice of all these go free And boast perhaps in her success, and cry, 'Twas but a little harmless perjury: Yet think she not, she still secure shall prove, Or that none dare avenge an injur'd Love: I rise in Judgement, am to be to her Both Witness, Judge, and Executioner: Arm'd with dire Satyr, and resentful spite, I come to haunt her with the ghosts of Wit. My Ink unbid starts out, and flies on her, Like blood upon some touching murderer: And shou'd that fail, rather than want, I wou'd, Like Haggs, to curse her, write in my own blood. Ye spightful pow'rs (if any there can be, That boast a worse, and keener spite than I) Assist with Malice, and your mighty aid My sworn Revenge, and help me Rhime her dead: Grant I may fix such brands of Infamy, So plain, so deeply grav'd on her, that she, Her Skill, Patches, nor Paint, all joyn'd can hide, And which shall lasting as her Soul abide: Grant my strong hate may such strong poison cast, That every breath may taint, and rot, and blast, Till one large Gangrene quite o'respread her fame With foul contagion; till her odious name, Spit at, and curst by every mouth like mine, Be terror to her self, and all her line. Vilest of that viler Sex, who damn'd us all! Ordain'd to cause, and plague us for our fall! WOMAN! nay worse! for she can nought be said, But Mummy by some Dev'l inhabited: Not made in Heaven's Mint, but base coin'd, She wears an humane image stampt on Fiend; And whoso Marriage would with her contract, Is Witch by Law, and that a meer compact: Her Soul (if any Soul in her there be) By Hell was breath'd into her in a lye, And its whole stock of falshood there was lent, As if hereafter to be true it meant: Bawd Nature taught her jilting, when she made And by her make, design'd her for the trade: Hence 'twas she daub'd her with a painted Face, That she at once might better cheat, and please: All those gay charming looks, that court the eye, Are but an ambush to hide treachery; Mischief adorn'd with pomp, and smooth disguise, A painted skin stuff'd full of guile and lyes; Within a gawdy Case, a nasty Soul, Like T? of quality in a gilt Close-stool: Such on a Cloud those flatt'ring colours are, Which only serve to dress a Tempest fair. So Men upon this Earth's fair surface dwell, Within are Fiends, and at the center Hell: Court-promises, the Leagues, which States-men make With more convenience, and more ease to break, The Faith, a Jesuit in allegiance swears, Or a Town-jilt to keeping Coxcombs bears, Are firm, and certain all, compar'd with hers: Early in falshood, at her Font she lied, And should ev'n then for Perjury been tried: Her Conscience stretch'd, and open as the Stews, But laughs at Oaths, and plays with solemn Vows. And at her mouth swallows down perjur'd breath, More glib than bits of Lechery beneath: Less serious known, when she doth most protest, Than thoughts of arrantest Buffoons in jest: More cheap, than the vile mercenariest Squire, That plies for Half-crown Fees at Westminster, And trades in staple-Oaths, and Swears to hire: Less Guilt than hers, less breach of Oath, and Word Has stood aloft, and look'd through Penance board; And he that trusts her in a Death-bed Prayer, Has Faith to merit, and save any thing, but her. But since her Guilt description does out-go; I'll try if it out-strip my Curses too; Curses, which may they equal my just hate, My wish, and her desert, be each so great, Each heard like Pray'rs, and Heaven make 'em fate. First, for her Beauties, which the Mischief brought, May she affected, they be borrow'd thought, By her own hand, not that of Nature wrought: Her Credit, Honour, Portion, Health, and those Prove light, and frail, as her broke Faith, and Vows. Some base unnam'd Disease, her Carkass foul, And make her Body ugly, as her Soul. Cankers, and Ulcers eat her, till she be, Shun'd like Infection, loath'd like Infamy. Strength quite expir'd, may she alone retain The snuff of Life, may that unquench'd remain, As in the damn'd, to keep her fresh for pain: Hot Lust light on her, and the plague of Pride On that, this ever scorn'd, as that denied: Ach, Anguish, horror, grief, dishonour, shame Pursue at once her body, soul, and fame: If e're the Devil-love must enter her (For nothing sure but Fiends can enter there) May she a just and true tormenter find, And that like an ill-conscience rack her mind: Be some Diseas'd, and ugly wretch her fate, She doom'd to love of one, whom all else hate. May he hate her, and may her destiny Be to despair, and yet love on, and die; Or to invent some wittier punishment, May he, to plague her, out of spite consent; May the old fumbler, though disabled quite, Have strength to give her Claps, but no delight: May he of her unjustly jealous be For one that's worse, and uglier far than he: May's Impotence balk, and torment her lust, Yet scarcely her to dreams, or wishes trust: Forc'd to be chast, may she suspected be, Share none o'th' Pleasure, all the Infamy. In fine, that I all curses may compleat (For I've but curs'd in jest, raillied yet) Whate're the Sex deserves, or feels, or fears, May all those plagues be hers, and only hers; Whate're great Favourites turn'd out of doors, Scorn'd Lovers, bilk'd and disappointed Whores, Or losing Gamesters vent, what Curses e're Are spoke by sinners raving in despair: All those fall on her, as they're all her due, Till spite can't think, nor Heav'n inflict anew: May then (for once I will be kind, and pray) No madness take her use of Sense away; But may she in full strength of Reason be, To feel, and understand her misery; Plagu'd so, till she think damning a release, And humbly pray to go to Hell for ease: Yet may not all these suff'rings here attone Her sin, and may she still go sinning on, Tick up in Perjury, and run o'th Score, Till on her Soul she can get trust no more: Then may she Stupid, and Repentless die, And Heav'n it self forgive no more than I, But so be damn'd of meer necessity.

      <field name="fulltext">[Book II.] SOME NEW PIECES Never before Publish'd. By the Author of the Satyrs upon the Jesuites. ? Nos otia vitæ Solamur cantu, ventosaque gaudia famæ Quærimus. ? Stat. Sylv. HORACE His ART of POETRY, Imitated in English. Address'd by way of Letter to a Friend. Should some ill Painter in a wild design To a mans Head an Horses shoulders joyn, Or Fishes Tail to a fair Womans Was Or draw the Limbs of many a different Beast, Ill match'd, and with as motly Feathers drest; If you by chance were to pass by his Shop; Could you forbear from laughing at the Fop, And not believe him whimsical, or mad? Credit me, Sir; that Book is quite as bad, As worthy laughter, which throughout is fill'd With monstrous inconsistencies, more vain, and wild Than sick mens Dreams, whose neither head, nor tail, Nor any parts in due proportion fall. But 'twill be said, None ever did deny Painters and Poets their free liberty Of feigning any thing: We grant it true, And the same privilege crave and allow: But to mix natures clearly opposite, To make the Serpent and the Dove unite, Or Lambs from savage Tygers seek defence, Shocks Reason, and the Rules of common Sense. Some, who would have us think they meant to treat At first on Arguments of greatest weight, Are pleas'd, when here and there a glittering line Does through the mass of their coarse rubbish shine: In gay digressions they delight to rove, Describing here a Temple, there a Grove, A Vale enamel'd o're with pleasant streams, A painted Rainbow, or the gliding Thames. But how does this relate to their design? Though good elsewhere, 'tis here but foisted in. A common Dawber may perhaps have skill To paint a Tavern Sign, or Landskip well: But what is this to drawing of a Fight, A Wrack, a Storm, or the last Judgment right? When the fair Model, and Foundation shews, That you some great Escurial would produce, How comes it dwindled to a Cottage thus? In fine, whatever work you mean to frame, Be uniform, and every where the same. Most Poets, Sir, ('tis easie to observe) Into the worst of faults are apt to swerve Through a false hope of reaching excellence: Avoiding length, we often cramp our Sense, And make't obscure; oft, when we'd have our stile Easie, and flowing, lose its force the while: Some, striving to surmount the common flight, Soar up in airy Bombast out of sight. Others, who fear to a bold pitch to trust Themselves, flag low, and humbly sweep the dust: And many fond of seeming marvellous, While they too carelesly transgress the Laws Of likelihood, most odd Chimeras feign, Dolphins in Woods, and Boars upon the Main. Thus they, who would take aim, but want the skill, Miss always, and shoot wide, or narrow still. One of the meanest Workmen in the Town Can imitate the Nails, or Hair in Stone, And to the life enough perhaps, who yet Wants mastery to make the Work complete: Troth, Sir, if 'twere my fancy to compose, Rather than be this bungling wretch, I'd choose To wear a crooked and unsightly Nose 'Mongst other handsom features of a Face Which only would set off my ugliness. Be sure all you that undertake to write, To chuse a Subject for your Genius fit: Try long and often what your Talents are; What is the burthen, which your parts will bear, And where they'l fail: he that discerns with skill To cull his Argument, and matter well, Will never be to seek for Eloquence To dress, or method to dispose his Sense. They the chief Art, and Grace in order show (If I may claim any pretence to know) Who time discreetly what's to be discours'd. What should be said at last, and what at first: Some passages at present may be heard, Others till afterward are best deferr'd: Verse, which disdains the Laws of History, Speaks things not as they are, but ought to be: Whoever will in Poetry excel, Must learn, and use this hidden secret well. 'Tis next to be observ'd, that care is due, And sparingness in framing words anew: You shew your mast'ry, if you have the knack So to make use of what known word you take, To give't a newer sense: if there be need For some uncommon matter to be said; Pow'r of inventing terms may be allow'd, Which Chaucer and his Age ne're understood: Provided always, as 'twas said before, We seldom, and discreetly use that pow'r. Words new and forein may be best brought in, If borrow'd from a Language near akin: Why should the peevish Criticks now forbid To Lee, and Dryden, what was not deny'd To Shakespear, Ben, and Fletcher heretofore, For which they praise, and commendation bore? If Spencer's Muse be justly so ador'd For that rich copiousness, wherewith he stor'd Our Native Tongue; for Gods sake why should I Straight be thought arrogant; if modestly I claim and use the self-same liberty? This the just Right of Poets ever was, And will be still, to coin what words they please, Well fitted to the present Age, and Place, Words with the Leaves of Trees a semblance hold In this respect, where every year the old Fall off, and new ones in their places grow: Death is the Fate of all things here below: Nature her self by Art has changes felt, The Tangier Mole (by our great Monarch built) Like a vast Bulwark in the Ocean set, From Pyrates and from Storms defends our Fleet: Fens every day are drain'd, and Men now Plow, And Sow, and Reap, where they before might Row, And Rivers have been taught by Middleton From their old course within new Banks to run, And pay their useful Tribute to the Town. If Mans and Natures works submit to Fate, Much less must words expect a lasting date: Many which we approve for currant now, In the next Age out of request shall grow: And others which are now thrown out of doors, Shall be reviv'd, and come again in force, If custom please: from whence their vogue they draw, Which of our Speech is the sole Judg, and Law. Homer first shew'd us in Heroick strains To write of Wars, of Battles and Campaigns, Kings and great Leaders, mighty in Renown, And him we still for our chief Pattern own, Soft Elegy, design'd for grief, and tears, Was first devis'd to grace some mournful Herse: Since to a brisker note 'tis taught to move, And cloaths our gayest Passions, Joy, and Love. But, who was first Inventer of the kind, Criticks have sought, but never yet could find. Gods, Heroes, Warriors, and the lofty praise Of peaceful Conquerors in Pisa's Race, The Mirth and Joys, which Love and Wine produce, With other wanton sallies of a Muse, The stately Ode does for its Subjects choose. Archilochus to vent his Gall and spite, In keen Iambicks first was known to write: Dramatick Authors us'd this sort of Verse On all the Greek and Roman Theaters, As for Discourse and Conversation fit, And apt'st to drown the noises of the Pit, If I discern not the true stile and air, Nor how to give the proper Character To every kind of work; how dare I claim, And challenge to my self a Poets Name? And why had I with awkard modesty, Rather than learn, always unskilful be? Volpone and Morose will not admit Of Catiline's high strains, nor is it fit To make Sejanus on the Stage appear In the low dress, which Comick persons wear. What e're the Subject be, on which you write, Give each thing its due place, and time aright: Yet Comedy sometimes may raise her stile, And angry Chremes is allow'd to swell, And Tragedy alike sometimes has leave To throw off Majesty, when 'tis to grieve: Peleus and Telephus in misery, Lay their big words, and blust'ring language by, If they expect to make their Audience cry. 'Tis not enough to have your Plays succeed; That they be elegant: they must not need Those warm and moving touches which impart A kind concernment to each Hearers heart, And ravish it which way they please with art. Where Joy and Sorrow put on good disguise, Ours with the persons looks straight sympathize: Would'st have me weep? thy self must first begin: Then, Telephus, to pity I incline, And think thy case, and all thy suff'rings mine; But if thou'rt made to act thy part amiss, I can't forbear to sleep, or laugh, or hiss, Let words express the looks, which speakers wear; Sad, fit a mournful, and dejected air; The passionate must huff, and storm, and rave; The gay be pleasant, and the serious grave. For Nature works, and moulds our Frame within, To take all manner of Impressions in. Now makes us hot, and ready to take fire, Now hope, now joy, now sorrow does inspire, And all these passions in our face appear, Of which the Tongue is sole interpreter: But he whose words, and Fortunes do not suit, By Pit and Gall'ry both, is hooted out. Observe what Characters your persons fit, Whether the Master speak, or Todelet: Whether a man, that's elderly in growth, Or a brisk Hotspur in his boiling youth: A roaring Bully, or a shirking Cheat, A Court-bred Lady, or a tawdry Cit: A prating Gossip, or a jilting Whore, A travell'd Merchant, or an home spun Boor: Spaniard, or French, Italian, Dutch, or Dane; Native of Turky, India, or Japan. Either from History your persons take, Or let them nothing inconsistent speak: If you bring great Achilles on the Stage, Let him be fierce and brave, all heat and rage, Inflexible, and head-strong to all Laws, But those, which Arms and his own will impose. Cruel Medea must no pity have, Ixion must be treacherous, Ino grieve, Io must wander, and Orestes rave, But if you dare to tread in paths unknown, And boldly start new persons of your own; Be sure to make them in one strain agree, And let the end like the beginning be. 'Tis difficult for Writers to succeed On Arguments, which none before have tri'd: The Iliad, or the Odyssee with ease Will better furnish Subjects for your Plays, Than that you should your own Invention trust, And broach unheard of things your self the first. In copying others works, to make them pass, And seem your own, let these few Rules take place: When you some of their Story represent, Take care that you new Episodes invent: Be not too nice the Authors words to trace, But vary all with a fresh air, and grace; Nor such strict rules of imitation choose, Which you must still be tied to follow close, Or forc'd to a retreat for want of room, Give over, and ridiculous become: Do not like that affected Fool begin, King Priam's Fate, and Troy's fam'd War, I sing. What will this mighty Promiser produce? You look for Mountains, and out creeps a Mouse. How short is this of Homer's fine Address, And Art, who ne're says any thing amiss? Muse, speak the man, Who since Troy's laying waste Into such numerous Dangers has been cast, So many Towns, and various People past: He does not lavish at a blaze his Fire, To glare a while, and in a Snuff expire: But modesty at first conceals his light, In dazling wonders, then breaks forth to sight; Surprizes you with Miracles all o're, Makes dreadful Scylla and Charybdis roar, Cyclops, and bloudy Lestrygons devour: Nor does he time in long Preambles spend, Describing Meleager's rusul end, When he's of Diomed's return to treat; Nor when he would the Trojan War relate, The Tale of brooding Leda's Eggs repeat. But still to the design'd event hastes on, And at first dash, as if before 'twere known, Embarques you in the middle of the Plot, And what is unimprovable leaves out, And mixes Truth and Fiction skilfully, That nothing in the whole may disagree. Who e're you are, that set your selves to write, If you expect to have your Audience sit Till the fifth Act be done, and Curtain fall; Mind what Instructions I shall further tell: Our Guise, and Manners alter with our Age, And such they must be brought upon the Stage. A Child, who newly has to Speech attain'd, And now can go without the Nurses hand, To play with those of his own growth is pleas'd, Suddenly angry, and as soon appeas'd, Fond of new Trifles, and as quickly cloy'd, And loaths next hour what he the last enjoy'd. The beardless Youth from Pedagogue got loose, Does Dogs and Horses for his pleasures choose; Yielding, and soft to every print of vice, Resty to those who would his faults chastise, Careless of Profit, of expences vain, Haughty, and eager his desires t'obtain. And swift to quit the same desires again. Those, who to manly years, and sense are grown, Seek Wealth and Friendship, Honour and Renown: And are discreet, and fearful how to act What after they must alter and correct. Diseases, Ills, and Troubles numberless Attend old Men, and with their Age increase: In painful toil they spend their wretched years, Still heaping Wealth, and with that wealth new cares: Fond to possess, and fearful to enjoy, Slow, and suspicious in their managry, Full of Delays, and Hopes, lovers of ease, Greedy of life, morose, and hard to please, Envious at Pleasures of the young and gay, Where they themselves now want a stock to play; Ill natur'd Censors of the present Age, And what has past since they have quit the Stage: But loud Admirers of Queen Besse's time, And what was done when they were in their prime. Thus, what our tide of flowing years brings in, Still with our ebb of life goes out agen: The humors of Fourscore will never hit One of Fifteen, nor a Boy's part befit A full-grown man: it shews no mean Address, If you the tempers of each Age express. Some things are best to act, others to tell; Those by the ear convey'd, do not so well, Nor half so movingly affect the mind, As what we to our eyes presented find. Yet there are many things, which should not come In view, nor pass beyond the Tiring Room: Which, after in expressive Language told, Shall please the Audience more, than to behold: Let not Medea shew her fatal rage, And cut her Childrens Throats upon the Stage: Nor Oedipus tear out his eye-balls there, Nor bloudy Atreus his dire Feast prepare: Cadmus, nor Progne their odd changes take, This to a Bird, the other to a Snake: Whatever so incredible you show, Shocks my Belief, and straight does nauseous grow. Five Acts, no more, nor less, your Play must have, If you'l an handsom Third Days share receive. Let not a God be summon'd to attend On a slight errand, nor on Wire descend, Unless th' importance of the Plot engage; And let but Three at once speak on the Stage. Be sure to make the Chorus still promote The chief Intrigue and business of the Plot: Betwixt the Acts there must be nothing Sung, Which does not to the main Design belong: The praises of the Good must here be told, The Passions curb'd, and foes of Vice extoll'd: Here Thrift and Temperance, and wholesome Laws, Strict Justice, and the gentle calms of Peace Must have their Commendations, and Applause: And Prayers must be sent to Heaven to guide Blind Fortunes blessings to the juster side, To raise the Poor, and lower prosp'rous Pride. At first the Musick of our Stage was rude, Whilst in the Cock-Pit and Black Friers it stood: And this might please enough in former Reigns, A thrifty, thin, and bashful Audience: When Bussy d' Ambois and his Fustian took, And men were ravish'd with Queen Gordobuc. But since our Monarch by kind Heaven sent, Brought back the Arts with him from Banishment, And by his gentle influence gave increase To all the harmless Luxuries of peace: Favour'd by him, our Stage has flourish'd too, And every day in outward splendor grew: In Musick, Song, and Dance of every kind, And all the grace of Action 'tis tefin'd; And since that Opera's at length came in, Our Players have so well improv'd the Scene With gallantry of Habit, and Machine, As makes our Theater in Glory vie With the best Ages of Antiquity: And mighty Roscius were he living now, Would envy both our Stage, and Acting too. Those, who did first in Tragedy essay (When a vile Goat was all the Poets day) Us'd to allay their Subjects gravity With enterludes of Mirth, and Raillery: Here they brought rough, and naked Satyrs in, Whose Farce-like Gesture, Motion, Speech, and Meen Resemble those of modern Harlequin. Because such antick Tricks, and odd grimace, After their drunken Feasts on Holidays, The giddy and hot-headed Rout would please: As the wild Feats of Merry Andrews now Divert the sensless Crowd at Bartholmew. But he, that would in this Mock-way excel, And exercise the Art of Railing well, Had need with diligence observe this Rule In turning serious things to ridicule: If he an Hero, or a God bring in, With Kingly Robes and Scepter lately seen, Let them not speak, like Burlesque Characters, The wit of Billingsgate and Temple-stairs: Nor, while they of those meannesses beware, In tearing lines of Bajazet appear. Majestick Tragedy as much disdains To condescend to low, and trivial strains: As a Court-Lady thinks her self disgrac'd To Dance with Dowdies at a May-pole-Feast. If in this kind you will attempt to write, You must no broad and clownish words admit: Nor must you so confound your Characters, As not to mind what person 'tis appears. Take a known Subject, and invent it well, And let your stile be smooth and natural: Though others think it easie to attain, They'l find it hard, and imitate in vain: So much does method and connexion grace The common'st things, the plainest matters raise. In my opinion 'tis absurd and odd, To make wild Satyrs, coming from the Wood, Speak the fine Language of the Park and Mall, As if they had their Training at Whitehall: Yet, tho I would not have their Words too quaint, Much less can I allow them impudent: For men of Breeding, and of Quality Must needs be shock'd with fulsom Ribaldry: Which, though it pass the Footboy and the Cit, Is always nauseous to the Box, and Pit. There are but few, who have such skilful ears To judg of artless, and ill-measured Verse. This till of late was hardly understood, And still, there's too much liberty allow'd. But will you therefore be so much a fool To write at random, and neglect a Rule? Or, while your faults are set to general view, Hope all men should be blind, or pardon you? Who would not such fool-hardiness condemn, Where, tho perchance you may escape from blame. Yet praise you never can expect, or claim? Therefore be sure your study to apply To the great patterns of Antiquity: Ne're lay the Greeks and Romans out of sight, Ply them by day, and think on them by night. Rough hobbling numbers were allow'd for Rhime, And clench for deep conceit in former time: With too much patience (not to call it worse) Both were applauded in our Ancestors: If you, or I have sense to judg aright Betwixt a Quibble, and true sterling Wit: Or ear enough to give the difference Of sweet well-sounding Verse from doggrel strains. Thespis ('tis said) did Tragedy devise, Unknown before, and rude at its first rise: In Carts the Gypsie Actors strowl'd about, With faces smear'd with Lees of Wine and Soot, And through the Towns amus'd the wondring rout Till Æschylus appearing to the Age, Contriv'd a Play-house, and convenient Stage. Found out the use of Vizards, and a Dress (An handsomer, and more gentile Disguise) And taught the Actors with a stately Air, And Meen to speak, and Tread, and whatsoe're Gave Port, and grandeur to the Theater. Next this succeeded ancient Comedy, With good applause, till too much liberty Usurp'd by Writers had debauch'd the Stage, And made it grow the Grievance of the Age: No merit was secure, no person free From its licentious Buffoonery: Till for redress the Magistrate was fain By Law those Insolencies to restrain. Our Authors in each kind their praise may claim, Who leave no paths untrod, that lead to fame: And well they merit it, who scorn'd to be So much the Vassals of Antiquity, As those, who know no better than to cloy With the old musty Tales of Thebes and Troy: But boldly the dull beaten track forsook, And Subjects from our Country-story took. Nor would our Nation less in Wit appear, Than in its great performances of War; Were there encouragements to bribe our care, Would we to file, and finish spare the pains, And add but justness to our manly sense. But, Sir, let nothing tempt you to bely Your skill, and judgment, by mean flattery: Never pretend to like a piece of Wit, But what, you're certain, is correctly writ: But what has stood all Tests, and is allow'd By all to be unquestionably good. Because some wild Enthusiasts there be Who bar the Rules of Art in Poetry. Would have it rapture all, and scarce admit A man of sober sense to be a Wit; Others by this conceit have been misled So much, that they're grown statutably mad: The Sots affect to be retir'd alone, Court Solitude and Conversation shun, In dirty Cloaths, and a wild Garb appear, And scarce are brought to cut their Nails and Hair, And hope to purchace credit and esteem, When they, like Cromwel's Porter, frantick seem, Strange! that the very height of Lunacy, Beyond the cure of Allen, e're should be A mark of the Elect in Poetry. How much an Ass am I that us'd to Bleed, And take a Purge each Spring to clear my Head? None otherwise would be so good as I, At lofty strains, and rants of Poetry: But, faith, I am not yet so fond of Fame, To lose my Reason for a Poets name. Tho I my self am not dispos'd to write; In others I may serve to sharpen Wit: Acquaint them what a Poet's duty is, And how he shall perform it with success: Whence the materials for his work are sought, And how with skilful Art they must be wrought: And shew what is and is not decency, And where his faults and excellencies lie. Good sense must be the certain standard still To all that will pretend to writing well: If you'l arrive at that, you needs must be Well vers'd and grounded in Philosophy: Then choose a Subject, which you throughly know, And words unsought thereon will easie flow. Whoe're will write, must diligently mind The several sorts and ranks of humane kind: He that has learnt, what to his Country's due, What we to Parents, Friends, and Kindred owe, What charge a Statesman, or a Judg does bear, And what the parts of a Commander are; Will never be at loss (he may be sure) To give each person their due portraiture. Take humane life for your original, Keep but your Draughts to that, you'l never fail. Sometimes in Plays, though else but badly writ With nought of Force, or Grace, of Art, or Wit, Some one well humour'd Character we meet, That takes us more than all the empty Scenes, And jingling toys of more elaborate Pens. Greece had command of Language, Wit and Sense, For cultivating which she spar'd no pains: Glory her sole design, and all her aim Was how to gain here self immortal Fame: Our English Youth another way are bred, They're fitted for a Prentiship, and Trade, And Wingate's all the Authors, which they've read. The Boy has been a year at Writing-School, Has learnt Division, and the Golden Rule; Scholar enough! cries the old doting Fool, I'll hold a Piece, he'l prove an Alderman, And come to sit at Church with's Furs and Chain. This is the top design, the only praise, And sole ambition of the booby Race: While this base spirit in the Age does reign, And men might nought but Wealth and sordid gain, Can we expect or hope it should bring forth A work in Poetry of any worth, Fit for the learned Bodley to admit Among its Sacred Monuments of Wit? A Poet should inform us, or divert, But joyning both he shews his chiefest Art: Whatever Precepts you pretend to give, Be sure to lay them down both clear and brief: By that they're easier far to apprehend, By this more faithfully preserv'd in mind: All things superfluous are apt to cloy The Judgment, and surcharge the Memory. Let whatsoe'r of Fiction you bring in, Be so like Truth, to seem at least akin: Do not improbabilities conceive, And hope to ram them into my belief: Ne're make a Witch upon the Stage appear, Riding enchanted Broomstick through the Air: Nor Canibal a living Infant spew, Which he had murther'd, and devour'd but now. The graver sort dislike all Poetry, Which does not (as they call it) edifie: And youthful sparks as much that Wit dispise, Which is not strew'd with pleasant Gaieties. But he, that has the knack of mingling well What is of use with what's agreeable, That knows at once how to instruct and please, Is justly crown'd by all mens suffrages: These are the works, which valued every where, Enrich Paul's Church-yard and the Stationer: These admiration through all Nations claim, And through all Ages spread their Author's Fame. Yet there are faults wherewith we ought to bear; An Instrument may sometimes chance to jar In the best hand, in spight of all its care: Nor have I known that skilful Marks-man yet So fortunate, who never mist the White. But where I many excellencies find, I'm not so nicely critical to mind Each slight mistake an Author may produce, Which humane frailty justly may excuse. Yet he, who having oft been taught to mend A Fault, will still pursue it to the end, Is like that scraping Fool, who the same Note Is ever playing, and is ever out, And silly as that bubble every whit, Who at the self-same blot is always hit. When such a lewd incorrigible sot Lucks by meer chance upon some happy thought; Among such filthy trash, I vex to see't, And wonder how (the Devil!) he came by't. In works of bulk and length we now and then May grant an Author to be overseen: Homer himself, how sacred e're he is, Yet claims not a pretence to Faultlesness. Poems with Pictures a resemblance bear; Some (best at distance) shun a view too near: Others are bolder, and stand off to sight; These love the shade, those choose the clearest light, And dare the survey of the skilfull'st eyes: Some once, and some ten thousand times will please. Sir, though your self so much of knowledg own In these affairs, that you can learn of none, Yet mind this certain truth which I lay down: Most Callings else do difference allow, Where ordinary Parts, and Skill may do: I've known Physicians, who respect might claim, Tho they ne're rose to Willis his great fame: And there are Preachers who have great renown. Yet ne're come up to Sprat, or Tillotson: And Counsellors, or Pleaders in the Hall May have esteem, and practice, tho they fall Far short of smooth-tongu'd Finch in Eloquence, Tho they want Selden's Learning, Vaughan's sense, But Verse alone does of no mean admit, Who e're will please, must please us to the height: He must a Cowley or a Fleckno be, For there's no second Rate in Poetry: A dull insipid Writer none can bear, In every place he is the publick jeer, And Lumber of the Shops and Stationer. No man that understands to make a Feast, With a coarse Dessert will offend his Guest, Or bring ill Musick in to grate the ear, Because 'tis what the entertain might spare: 'Tis the same case with those that deal in Wit, Whose main design and end should be delight: They must by this same sentence stand, or fall, Be highly excellent, or not at all. In all things else, save only Poetry, Men shew some signs of common modesty: You'l hardly find a Fencer so unwise, Who at Bear-garden e're will fight a Prize, Not having learnt before: nor at a Wake One, that wants skill and strength, the Girdle take, Or be so vain the pond'rous Weight to fling, For fear they should be hiss'd out of the Ring. Yet every Coxcomb will pretend to Verse, And write in spight of nature, and his Stars: All sorts of Subjects challenge at this time The Liberty, and Property of Rhime. The Sot of honour, fond of being great By something else than Title, and Estate, As if a Patent gave him claim to sense, Or 'twere entail'd with an Inheritance, Believes a cast of Foot-boys, and a set Of Flanders must advance him to a Wit. But you who have the judgment to descry Where you excel, which way your Talents lie, I'm sure, will never be induc'd to strain Your Genius, or attempt against your vein. Yet (this let me advise) if e're you write, Let none of your composures see the light, Till they've been throughly weigh'd, and past the Test Of all those Judges who are thought the best: While in your Desk they're lock'd up from the Press, You've power to correct them as you please: But when they once come forth to view of all, Your Faults are Chronicled, and past recall. Orpheus the first of the inspired Train, By force of powerful numbers did restrain Mankind from rage, and bloudy cruelty, And taught the barbarous world civility, Hence rose the Fiction, which the Poets fram'd, That Lions were by's tuneful Magick tam'd, And Tygers, charm'd by his harmonious lays, Grew gentle, and laid by their savageness: Hence that, which of Amphion too they tell, The pow'r of whose miraculous Lute could call The well-plac'd stones into the Theban Wall. Wondrous were the effects of primitive Verse, Which setled and reform'd the Universe: This did all things to their due ends reduce, To publick, private, sacred, civil use: Marriage for weighty causes was ordain'd, That bridled lust, and lawless Love restrain'd: Cities with Walls, and Rampiers were inclos'd, And property with wholsom Laws dispos'd: And bounds were fix'd of Equity and Right, To guard weak Innocence from wrongful might. Hence Poets have been held a sacred name, And plac'd with first Rates in the Lists of Fame. Next these, great Homer to the world appear'd, Around the Globe his loud alarms were heard, Which all the brave to war-like action fir'd: And Hesiod after him with useful skill Gave Lessons to instruct the Plough-mans toil. Verse was the language of the gods of old, In which their sacred Oracles were told: In Verse were the first rules of vertue taught, And Doctrine thence, as now from Pulpits sought: By Verse some have the love of Princes gain'd, Who oft vouchsafe so to be entertain'd, And with a Muse their weighty cares unbend. Then think it no disparagement, dear Sir, To own your self a Member of that Quire, Whom Kings esteem, and Heaven does inspire. Concerning Poets there has been contest, Whether they're made by Art, or Nature best: But if I may presume in this Affair, Amongst the rest my judgment to declare, No Art without a Genius will avail, And Parts without the help of Art will fail: But both Ingredients joyntly must unite To make the happy Character complete. None at New-market ever won the Prize, But us'd his Airings, and his Exercise, His Courses and his Diets long before, And Wine, and Women for a time forbore: Nor is there any Singing-man, we know, Of good Repute in either Chappel now, But was a Learner once (he'l freely own) And by long Practice to that Skill has grown: But each conceited Dunce, without pretence To the least grain of Learning, Parts, or sense, Or any thing but harden'd impudence, Sets up for Poetry, and dares engage With all the topping Writers of the Age: “Why should not he put in amongst the rest? “Damn him! he scorns to come behind the best: “Declares himself a Wit, and vows to draw “On the next man, who e're disowns him so. Scriblers of Quality who have Estate, To gain applauding Fools at any rate, Practise as many tricks as Shop-keepers To force a Trade, and put off naughty wares: Some hire the House their Follies to expose, And are at charge to be ridiculous: Others with Wine, and Ordinaries treat A needy Rabble to cry up their Wit: 'Tis strange, that such should the true diff'rence find Betwixt a spunging Knave and faithful Friend. Take heed how you e're prostitute your sense To such a fawning crew of Sycophants: All signs of being pleas'd the Rogues will feign, Wonder, and bless themselves at every line. Swearing, “'Tis soft! 'tis charming! 'tis Divine! Here they'l look pale, as if surpriz'd, and there In a disguise of grief squeeze out a tear: Oft seem transported with a sudden joy, Stamp and lift up their hands in extasie: But, if by chance your back once turn'd appear, You'l have 'em strait put out their tongues in jeer, Or point, or gibe you with a scornful sneer. As they who truly grieve at Funerals, shew Less outward sorrow than hir'd mourners do; So true Admirers less concernment wear Before your face than the sham Flatterer. They tell of Kings, who never would admit A Confident, or bosom-Favourite, Till store of Wine had made his secrets float, And by that means they'd found his temper out: 'Twere well if Poets knew some way like this, How to discern their friends from enemies. Had you consulted learned Ben of old, He would your faults impartially have told: “This Verse correction wants (he would have said) “And so does this: If you replied, you had To little purpose several trials made; He presently would bid you strike a dash On all, and put in better in the place: But if he found you once a stubborn sot, That would not be corrected in a fault; He would no more his pains and counsel spend On an abandon'd Fool that scorn'd to mend; But bid you in the Devils name go on, And hug your dear impertinence alone. A trusty knowing Friend will boldly dare To give his sense and judgment, wheresoe're He sees a Fault: “Here, Sir, good faith, you're low, “And must some heightning on the place bestow: “There, if you mind, the Rhime is harsh, and rough, “And should be soft'ned to go smoothlier off: “Your strokes are here of Varnish left too bare, “Your Colours there too thick laid on appear: “Your Metaphor is coarse, that Phrase not pure, “This Word improper, and that sense obscure. In fine, you'l find him a strict Censurer, That will not your least negligences spare Through a vain fear of disobliging you: They are but slight, and trivial things, 'tis true: Yet these same Trifles (take a Poets word) Matter of high importance will afford, When e're by means of them you come to be Expos'd to Laughter, Scorn, and Infamy. Not those with Lord have mercy on their doors, Venom of Adders, or infected Whores, Are dreaded worse by men of sense, and Wit, Than a mad Scribler in his raving fit: Like Dog, whose tail is pegg'd into a bone, The hooting Rabble all about the Town, Pursue the Cur, aund pelt him up and down. Should this poor Frantick, as he pass'd along, Intent on's Rhiming work amidst the throng, Into Fleet-Ditch, or some deep Cellar fall, And till he rent his throat for succour bawl, No one would lend an helping hand at call: For who (the Plague!) could guess at his design, Whether he did not for the nonce drop in? I'd tell you, Sir, but questionless you've heard Of the odd end of a Sicilian Bard: Fond to be deem'd a god, this fool (it seems) In's fit leapt headlong into Ætna's Flames. Troth, I could be content an Act might pass, Such Poets should have leave, when e're they please, To die, and rid us of our Grievances. A God's name let'em hang, or drown, or choose What other way they will themselves dispose, Why should we life against their wills impose? Might that same fool I mention'd, now revive, He would not be reclaim'd, I dare believe, But soon be playing his old freaks again, And still the same capricious hopes retain. 'Tis hard to guess, and harder to alledg Whether for Parricide, or Sacriledg, Or some more strange, unknown, and horrid crime, Done in their own, or their Fore-fathers time, These scribling Wretches have been damn'd to Rhime: But certain 'tis, for such a crack-braind Race Bedlam, or Hogsdon is the fittest place: Without their Keepers you had better choose To meet the Lions of the Tower broke loose, Than these wild savage Rhymers in the street, Who with their Verses worry all they meet: In vain you would release your self; so close The Leeches cleave, that there's no getting loose. Remorsless they to no entreaties yield, Till you are with inhumane non-sense kill'd. An Imitation of HORACE. Book I. Satyr IX. Written in June, 1681. Ibam fortè viâ sacrâ, &amp;c. As I was walking in the Mall of late, Alone, and musing on I know not what; Comes a familiar Fop, whom hardly I Knew by his name, and rudely seizes me: Dear Sir, I'm mighty glad to meet with you: And pray, how have you done this Age, or two? “Well I thank God (said I) as times are now: “I wish the same to you. And so pass'd on, Hoping with this the Coxcomb would be gone. But when I saw I could not thus get free; I ask'd, what business else he had with me? Sir (answered he) If Learning, Parts, or Sense Merit your friendship; I have just pretence. “I honour you (said I) upon that score, “And shall be glad to serve you to my power. Mean time, wild to get loose, I try all ways To shake him off: Sometimes I walk apace, Sometimes stand still: I frown, I chafe, I fret, Shrug, turn my back, as in the Baigno, sweat: And shew all kind of signs to make him guess At my impatience, and uneasiness. “Happy the folk in Newgate! (whisper'd I) “Who, tho in Chains are from this torment free: “Wou'd I were like rough Manly in the Play, “To send Impertinents with kicks away.! He all the while baits me with tedious chat, Speaks much about the drought, and how the rate Of Hay is rais'd, and what it now goes at: Tells me of a new Comet at the Hague, Portending God knows what, a Dearth, or Plague: Names every Wench, that passes through the Park, How much she is allow'd, and who the Spark, That keeps her: points, who lately got a Clap, And who at the Groom-Porters had ill hap Three nights ago in play with such a Lord: When he observ'd, I minded not a word, And did no answer to his trash afford; Sir, I perceive you stand on Thorns (said he) And fain would part: but, faith, it must not be: Come, let us take a Bottle. (I cried) “No; “Sir, I am in a Course, and dare not now. Then tell me whether you desire to go: I'll wait upon you. “Oh! Sir, 'tis too far: “I visit cross the Water: therefore spare “Your needless trouble. Trouble! Sir, 'tis none: 'Tis more by half to leave you here alone. I have no present business to attend, At least which I'll not quit for such a Friend: Tell me not of the distance: for I vow, I'll cut the LIne, double the Cape for you, Good faith, I will not leave you: make no words; Go you to Lambeth? Is it to my Lords? His Steward I most intimately know, Have often drunk with his Comptroller too. By this I found my Wheadle would not pass, But rather serv'd my suff'rings to increase: And seeing 'twas in vain to vex, or fret, I patiently submitted to my Fate. Strait he begins again: Sir, if you knew My worth but half so throughly as I do; I'm sure, you would not value any Friend You have, like me: but that I won't commend My self, and my own Talents; I might tell How many ways to wonder I excel. None has a greater gift in Poetry, Or writes more Verses with more ease than I: I'm grown the envy of the men of Wit, I kill'd ev'n Rochester with grief, and spight: Next for the Dancing part I all surpass, St. Andrew never mov'd with such a grace: And 'tis well known, when e're I sing, or set, Humphreys, nor Blow could ever match me yet. Here I got room to interrupt: “Have you “A Mother, Sir, or Kindred living now? Not one: they are all dead. “Troth, so I guest: “The happier they (said I) who are at rest. “Poor I am only left unmurder'd yet: “Haste, I beseech you, and dispatch me quite: “For I am well convinc'd, my time is come: “When I was young, a Gypsie told my doom: This Lad (said she, and look'd upon my hand) Shall not by Sword, or Poyson come to's end, Nor by the Fever, Dropsie, Gout, or Stone, But he shall die by an eternal Tongue: Therefore, when he's grown up, if he be wise, Let him avoid great Talkers, I advise. By this time we were got to Westminster; Where he by chance a Trial had to hear, And, if he were not there, his Cause must fall: Sir, if you love me, step into the Hall For one half hour, “The Devil take me now, “(Said I) if I know any thing of Law: “Besides I told you whither I'm to go. Hereat he made a stand, pull'd down his Hat Over his eyes, and mus'd in deep debate: “I'm in a straight (said he) what I shall do: Whether forsake my business, Sir, or you. “Me by all means (say I) No (says my Sot) I fear you'l take it ill, If I should do't: I'm sure, you will. “Not I, by all that's good, But I've more breeding, than to be so rude. “Pray, don't neglect your own concerns for me: “Your Cause, good Sir! My Cause be damn'd (says he) I value't less than your dear Company. With this he came up to me, and would lead The way; I sneaking after hung my head. Next he begins to plague me with the Plot, Asks, whether I were known to Oats or not? “Not I, thank Heaven! I no. Priest have been: “Have never Doway, nor St. Omers seen, What think you, Sir; will they Fitz-Harris try? Will he die, think you? Yes, most certainly. I mean, be hang'd. “Would thou wert so (wish'd I.) Religion came in next; tho he'd no more Than the French King, his Punk, or Confessor. Oh! the sad times, if once the King should die! Sir, are you not afraid of Popery? “No more than my Superiors: why should I? “I've no Estate in Abby-Lands to lose, But Fire, and Faggot, Sir, how like you those? “Come Inquisition, any thing (thought I) “So Heav'n would bless me to get rid of thee: “But 'tis some comfort, that my Hell is here: “I need no punishment hereafter fear. Scarce had I thought, but he falls on anew How stands it, Sir, betwixt his Grace, and you? “Sir, he's a man of sense above the Crowd, “And shuns the Converse of a Multitude. Ay, Sir, (Says he) you're happy, who are near His Grace, and have the favour of his ear: But let me tell you, if you'l recommend This person here, your point will soon be gain'd. Gad, Sir, I'll die, if my own single Wit Don't Fob his Minions, and displace 'em quite. And make your self his only Favourite. “No, you are out abundantly (said I) “We live not, as you think: no Family “Throughout the whole three Kingdoms is more free “From those ill Customs, which are us'd to swarm “In great mens houses; none e're does me harm, “Because more Learned, or more Rich, than I: “But each man keeps his Place, and his Degree. 'Tis mighty strange (says he) what you relate, “But nothing truer, take my word for that. You make me long to be admitted too Amongst his Creatures: Sir, I beg, that you Will stand my Friend: Your Interest is such, You may prevail, I'm sure, you can do much. He's one, that may be won upon, I've heard, Tho at the first approach access be hard. I'll spare no trouble of my own, or Friends, No cost in Fees, and Bribes to gain my ends: I'll seek all opportunities to meet With him, accost him in the very street: Hang on his Coach, and wait upon him home, Fawn, Scrape and Cringe to him, nay, to his Groom. Faith, Sir, this must be done, If we'll be great: Preferment comes not at a cheaper rate. While at this Savage rate he worried me; By chance a Doctor, my dear Friend came by, That knew the Fellow's humour passing well: Glad of the sight, I joyn him; we stand still: Whence came you, Sir? and whither go you now? And such like questions pass'd betwixt us two: Strait I begin to pull him by the sleeve, Nod, wink upon him, touch my Nose, and give A thousand hints, to let him know, that I Needed his help for my delivery: He, naughty Wag, with an Arch fleering smile Seems ignorant of what I mean the while: I grow stark wild with rage. “Sir, said not you, “You'd somewhat to discourse, not long ago, “With me in private? I remember't well: Some other time, be sure, I will not fail: Now I am in great haste upon my word: A Messenger came for me from a Lord, That's in a bad condition, like to die. “Oh! Sir, he can't be in a worse, than I: “Therefore for God's sake do not stir from hence. Sweet Sir! your pardon: 'tis of consequence: I hope you're kinder than to press my stay, Which may be Heav'n knows what out of my way. This said, he left me to my murderer: Seeing no hopes of my relief appear; “Confounded be the Stars (said I) that sway'd “This fatal day! would I had kept my Bed “With sickness, rather than been visited “With this worse Plague! what ill have I e're done “To pull this curse, this heavy Judgment down? While I was thus lamenting my ill hap, Comes aid at length: a brace of Bailiffs clap The Rascal on the back: “Here take your Fees, “Kind Gentlemen (said I) for my release. He would have had me Bail. “Excuse me, Sir, “I've made a Vow ne're to be Surety more: “My Father was undone by't heretofore. Thus I got off, and bless'd the Fates that he Was Pris'ner made, I set at liberty. Paraphrase upon HORACE. Book I. Ode XXXI. Quid dedicatum poscit Apollinem Vates? &amp;c.? 1. What does the Poet's modest Wish require? What Boon does he of gracious Heav'n desire? Not the large Corps of Esham's goodly Soil, Which tire the Mower's, and the Reaper's toil; Not the soft Flocks, on hilly Cotswold fed, Nor Lemster Fields with living Fleeces clad: He does not ask the Grounds, where gentle Thames, Or Severn spread their fat'ning Streams. Where they with wanton windings play, And eat their widen'd Banks insensibly away: He does not ask the Wealth of Lombard-street, Which Consciences, and Souls are pawn'd to get. Nor those exhaustless Mines of Gold, Which Guinny and Peru in their rich bosoms hold. 2. Let those that live in the Canary Isles, On which indulgent Nature ever smiles, Take pleasure in their plenteous Vintages, And from the juicy Grape its racy Liquor press: Let wealthy Merchants, when they Dine, Run o're their costly names of Wine, Their Chests of Florence, and their Mont-Alchine. Their Mants, Champagns, Chablees, Frontiniacks tell, Their Aums of Hock, of Backrag and Moselle: He envies not their Luxury Which they with so much pains, and danger buy: For which so many Storms, and Wrecks they bear, For which they pass the Streights so oft each year, And scape so narrowly the Bondage of Argier. 3. He wants no Cyprus Birds, nor Ortolans, Nor Dainties fetch'd from far to please his Sense, Cheap wholsom Herbs content his frugal Board. The food of unfaln Innocence, Which the mean'st Village Garden does afford: Grant him, kind Heav'n, the sum of his desires, What Nature, not what Luxury requires: He only does a Competency claim, And, when he has it, wit to use the same: Grant him sound Health, impair'd by no Disease, Nor by his own Excess: Let him in strength of Mind, and Body live, But not his Reason, nor his Sense survive: His Age (if Age he e're must live to see) Let it from want, Contempt, and Care be free. But not from Mirth, and the delights of Poetry, Grant him but this, he's amply satisfi'd, And scorns whatever Fate can give beside. Paraphrase upon HORACE. Book II. Ode XIV. Eheu fugaces, Posthume, Posthume, Labuntur anni, &amp;c. 1. Alas! dear Friend, alas! time hastes away, Nor is it in our pow'r to bribe its stay: The rolling years with constant motion run, Lo! while I speak, the present minute's gone, And following hours urge the foregoing on. 'Tis not thy Wealth, 'tis not thy Power, 'Tis not thy Piety can thee secure: They're all too feeble to withstand Grey Hairs, approaching Age, and thy avoidless end. When once thy fatal Glass is run, When once thy utmost Thread is spun, 'Twill then be fruitless to expect Reprieve: Could'st thou ten thousand Kingdoms give In purchase for each hour of longer life, They would not buy one gasp of breath, Not move one jot inexorable Death. 2. All the vast stock of humane Progeny, Which now like swarms of Insects crawl Upon the Surface of Earth's spacious Ball, Must quit this Hillock of Mortality, And in its Bowels buried lie. The mightiest King, and proudest Potentate, In spight of all his Pomp, and all his State, Must pay this necessary Tribute unto Fate. The busie, restless Monarch of the times, which now Keeps such a pother, and so much ado To fill Gazettes alive, And after in some lying Annal to survive; Ev'n He, ev'n that great mortal Man must die, And stink, and rot as well as thou, and I, As well as the poor tatter'd Wretch, that begs his bread, And is with scraps out of the common Basket fed. 3. In vain from dangers of the bloudy Field we keep, In vain we escape The sultry Line, and stormy Cape, And all the treacheries of the faithless Deep: In vain for health to forein Countries we repair, And change our English for Mompellier Air, In hope to leave our fears of dying there: In vain with costly far fetch'd Drugs we strive To keep the wasting vital Lamp alive: In vain on Doctors feeble Art rely; Against resistless Death there is no remedy: Both we, and they for all their skill must die, And fill alike the Bedrols of Mortality. 4. Thou must, thou must resign to Fate, my Friend, And leave thy House, thy Wife, and Family behind: Thou must thy fair, and goodly Mannors leave, Of these thy Trees thou shalt not with thee take, Save just as much as will thy Coffin make: Nor wilt thou be allow'd of all thy Land, to have, But the small pittance of a six-foot Grave. Then shall thy prodigal young Heir Lavish the Wealth, which thou for many a year Hast hoarded up with so much pains and care: Then shall he drain thy Cellars of their Stores, Kept sacred now as vaults of buried Ancestors: Shall set th' enlarged Butts at liberty, Which there close Pris'ners under durance lie, And wash these stately Floors with better Wine Than that of consecrated Prelates when they dine. The PRAISE of HOMER. ODE. 1. Hail God of Verse! pardon that thus I take in vain Thy sacred, everlasting Name, And in unhallow'd Lines blaspheme: Pardon that with strange Fire thy Altars I profane. Hail thou! to whom we mortal Bards our Faith submit, Whom we acknowledg our sole Text, and holy Writ: None other Judg infallible we own, But Thee, who art the Canon of authentick Wit alone. Thou art the unexhausted Ocean, whence Sprung first, and still do flow th' eternal Rills of sense: To none but Thee our Art Divine we owe, From whom it had its Rise, and full Perfection too. Thou art the mighty Bank, that ever do'st supply Throughout the world the whole Poetick Company: With thy vast stock alone they traffick for a name, And send their glorious Ventures out to all the Coasts of Fame, 2. How trulier blind was dull Antiquity, Who fasten'd that unjust Reproach on Thee? Who can the sensless Tale believe? Who can to the false Legend credit give? Or think thou wantedst sight, by whom all others see? What Land, or Region, how remote soe're, Does not so well describ'd in thy great Draughts appear, That each thy native Country seems to be, And each t'have been survey'd, and measur'd out By thee? Whatever Earth does in her pregnant Bowels bear, Or on her fruitful Surface wear; What e're the spacious Fields of Air contain, Or far extended Territories of the Main; Is by thy skilful Pencil so exactly shown, We scarce discern where thou, or Nature best has drawn, Nor is thy quick all-piercing Eye Or check'd, or bounded here: But farther does surpass, and farther does descry: Beyond the Travels of the Sun, and Year. Beyond this glorious Scene of starry Tapestry, Where the vast Purliews of the Sky, And boundless waste of Nature lies, Thy Voyages thou mak'st, and bold Discoveries. What there the Gods in Parliament debate, What Votes, or Acts i'th' Heav'nly Houses pass, By Thee so well communicated was; As if thou'dst been of that Cabal of State, As if Thou hadst been sworn the Privy-Counsellor of Fate. 3. What Chief, who does thy Warrior's great Exploits survey, Will not aspire to Deeds as great as they? What generous Readers would he not inspire With the same gallant Heat, the same ambitious Fire? Methinks from Ida's top with noble Joy I view The warlike Squadrons by his daring Conduct led, I see th' immortal Host engaging on his side, And him the blushing Gods out-do. Where e're he does his dreadful Standards bear, Horror stalks in the Van, and Slaughter in the Rere. Whole Swarths of Enemies his Sword does mow, And Limbs of mangled Chiefs his passage strow, And flouds of reeking Gore the Field o'reflow: While Heavn's dread Monarch from his Throne of State, With high concern upon the Fight looks down, And wrinkles his Majestick Brow into a Frown, To see bold Man, like him, distribute Fate. 4. While the great Macedonian Youth in Non-age grew, Not yet by Charter of his years set free From Guardians, and their slavish tyranny, No Tutor, but the Budg Philosophers he knew: And well enough the grave, and useful Tools Might serve to read him Lectures, and to please With unintelligible Jargon of the Schools, And airy Terms and Notions of the Colleges: They might the Art of Prating, and of Brawling teach, And some insipid Homilies of Vertue preach: But when the mighty Pupil had outgrown Their musty Discipline, when manlier Thoughts possess'd His generous Princely Breast, Now ripe for Empire, and a Crown, And fill'd with lust of Honour, and Renown; He then learnt to contemn The despicable things, the men of Flegm: Strait he to the dull Pedants gave release, And a more noble Master strait took place: Thou, who the Grecian Warriour so could'st praise, As might in him just envy raise, Who (one would think) had been himself too high To envy any thing of all Mortality, 'Twas thou that taught'st him Lessons loftier far, The Art of Reigning, and the Art of War: And wondrous was the Progress, which he made, While he the Acts of thy great Pattern read: The World too narrow for his boundless Conquests grew, He Conquer'd one, and wish'd, and wept for new: From thence he did those Miracles produce, And Fought, and Vanquish'd by the Conduct of a Muse. 5. No wonder rival Nations quarrell'd for thy Birth, A Prize of greater and of higher worth Than that which led whole Greece, and Asia forth, Than that, for which thy mighty Hero fought, And Troy with ten years War, and its Destruction bought. Well did they think it noble to have bore that Name, Which the whole world would with ambition claim: Well did they Temples raise To Thee, at whom Nature her self stood in amaze, A work, she never tried to mend, nor cou'd, In which mistaking Man, by chance she form'd a God. How gladly would our willing Isle resign Her fabulous Arthur, and her boasted Constantine, And half her Worthies of the Norman Line, And quit the honour of their Births to be ensur'd to Thine? How justly might it the wise choice approve. Prouder in this than Crete to have brought forth Almighty Jove? 6. Unhappy we, thy British Off-spring here, Who strive by thy great Model Monuments to rear: In vain for worthless Fame we toil, That's pent in the strait limits of a narrow Isle: In vain our Force, and Art we spend With noble labours to enrich our Land, Which none beyond our Shores vouchsafe to understand. Be the fair structure ne'r so well design'd, The parts with ne'r so much proportion joyn'd; Yet foreign Bards (such is their Pride, or Prejudice) All the choice Wormanship for the Materials sake despise. But happier thou thy Genius didst dispence In Language universal as thy sense: All the rich Bullion, which thy Soveraign Stamp does wear On every Coast of Wit does equal value bear, Allow'd by all, and currant every where. No Nation yet has been so barbarous found, Where thy transcendent Worth was not renown'd. Throughout the World thou art with Wonder read, Where ever Learning does its Commerce spread, Where ever Fame with all her Tongues can speak, Where ever the bright God of Wit does his vast Journies take, 7. Happy above Mankind that envied Name, Which Fate ordain'd to be thy glorious Theme: What greater Gift could bounteous Heaven bestow On its chief Favourite below? What nobler Trophy could his high Deserts befit, Than these thy vast erected Pyramids of Wit? Not Statutes cast in solid Brass, Nor those, which Art in breathing Marble does express, Can boast an equal Life, or lastingness With their well-polish'd Images, which claim A Nich in thy Majestick Monuments of Fame. Here their embalm'd incorruptible memories Can proudest Louvres, and Escurials despise, And all the needless helps of Ægypts costly Vanities. No Blasts of Heaven, or Ruine of the Spheres, Not all the washing Tides of rolling years, Nor the whole Race of batt'ring time shall e're wear out The great Inscriptions, which thy Hand has wrought, Here thou, and they shall live, and bear an endless date, Firm, as enroll'd in the eternal Register of Fate. For ever curst be that mad Emperour, (And curs'd enough he is be sure) May future Poets on his hated Name Shed all their Gall, and foulest Infamy, And may it here stand branded with eternal shame, Who thought thy Works could mortal be, And sought the glorious Fabrick to destroy: In this (could Fate permit it to be done) His damned Successor he had out-gone, Who Rome and all its Palaces in Ashes laid, And the great Ruins with a savage Joy survey'd: He burnt but what might be re-built and richer made. But had the impious Wish succeeded here, 'T had raiz'd what Age, nor Art could e're repair. Not that vast universal Flame, Which at the final Doom This beauteous Work of Nature must consume, And Heav'n and all its Glories in one Urn entomb, Will burn a nobler, or more lasting Frame: As firm, and strong as that it shall endure, Through all the Injuries of Time secure, Nor die, till the whole world its Funeral Pile become. Two Pastorals out of the Greek. BION. A Pastoral, in Imitation of the Greek of Moschus, bewailing the Death of the Earl of Rochester. Mourn all ye Groves, in darker shades be seen, Let Groans be heard, where gentle Winds have been: Ye Albion Rivers, weep your Fountains dry, And all ye Plants your moisture spend, and die: Ye melancholy Flowers, which once were Men, Lament, until you be transform'd agen: Let every Rose pale as the Lilly be, And Winter Frost seize the Atemone: But thou, O Hyacinth, more vigorous grow In mournful Letters thy sad glory show, Enlarge thy grief, and flourish in thy wo: For Bion, the beloved Bion's dead, His voice is gone, his tuneful breath is fled. Come all ye Muses, come, adorn the Shepherd's Herse With never-fading Garlands, never-dying Verse. Mourn ye sweet Nightingales in the thick Woods, Tell the sad news to all the British Floods: See it to Isis, and to Cham convey'd, To Thames, to Humber, and to utmost Tweed: Annd bid them waft the bitter tidings on, How Bion's dead, how the lov'd Swain is gone, And with him all the Art of graceful Song. Come all ye Muses, come, adorn the Shepherd's Herse With never-fading Garlands, never-dying Verse. Ye gentle Swans, that haunt the Brooks, and Springs, Pine with sad grief, and droop your sickly Wings: In doleful notes the heavy loss bewail, Such as you sing at your own Funeral, Such as you sung when your lov'd Orpheus fell. Tell it it to all the Rivers, Hills, and Plains, Tell it to all the British Nymphs and Swains, And bid them too the dismal tydings spread Of Bion's fate, of England's Orpheus dead, Come all ye Muses, come, adorn the Shepherd's Herse With never-fading Garlands, never-dying Verse. No more, alas! no more that lovely Swain Charms with his tuneful Pipe the wondring Plain: Ceast are those Lays, ceast are those sprightly airs, That woo'd our Souls into our ravish'd Ears: For which the list'ning streams forgot to run, And Trees lean'd their attentive branches down: While the glad Hills, loth the sweet sounds to lose, Lengthen'd in Echoes every heav'nly close. Down to the melancholy Shades he's gone, And there to Lethe's Banks reports his moan: Nothing is heard upon the Mountains now But pensive Herds that for their Master low: Stragling and comfortless about they rove, Unmindful of their Pasture, and their Love. Come all ye Muses, come, adorn the Shepherd's Herse, With never-fading Garlands, never-dying Verse. For thee, dear Swain, for thee, his much-lov'd Son, Does Phœbus Clouds of mourning black put on: For thee the Satyrs and the rustick Fauns Sigh and lament through all the Woods and Lawns: For thee the Fairies grieve, and cease to dance In sportful Rings by night upon the Plains: The water Nymphs alike thy absence mourn, And all their Springs to tears and sorrow turn: Sad Eccho too does in deep silence moan, Since thou art mute, since thou art speechless grown: She finds nought worth her pains to imitate, Now thy sweet breath's stopt by untimely fate: Trees drop their Leaves to dress thy Funeral, And all their Fruit before its Autumn fall: Each Flower fades, and hangs its wither'd head, And scorns to thrive, or live, now thou art dead: Their bleating Flocks no more their Udders fill, The painful Bees neglect their wonted toil: Alas! what boots it now their Hives to store With the rich spoils of every plunder'd Flower, when thou, that wast all sweetness, art no more? Come, all ye Muses, come, adorn the Shepherd's Herse, With never-fading Garlands, never-dying Verse. Ne'r did the Dolphins on the lonely Shore In such loud plaints utter their grief before: Never in such sad Notes did Philomel To the relenting Rocks her sorrow tell: Ne'r on the Beech did poor Alcyone So weep, when she her floating Lover saw: Nor that dead Lover, to a Sea-fowl turn'd, Upon those Waves, where he was drown'd, so mourn'd: Nor did the Bird of Memnon with such grief Bedew those Ashes, which late gave him life: As they did now with vying grief bewail, As they did all lament dear Bion's fall. Come all ye Muses, come, adorn the Shepherd's Herse With never-fading Garlands, never-dying Verse. In every Wood, on every Tree, and Bush The Lark, the Linnet, Nightingale, and Thrush, And all the feather'd Choir, that us'd to throng In list'ning Flocks to learn his well-tun'd Song. Now each in the sad Consort bear a part, And with kind Notes repay their Teachers Art: Ye Turtles too (I charge you) here assist, Let not your murmurs in the crowd be mist: To the dear Swain do not ungrateful prove, That taught you how to sing, and how to love. Come all ye Muses, come, adorn the Shepherd's Herse With never-fading Garlands, never-dying Verse. Whom hast thou left behind thee, skilful Swain, That dares aspire to reach thy matchless strain Who is there after thee, that dares pretend Rashly to take thy warbling Pipe in hand: Thy Notes remain yet fresh in every ear, And give us all delight, and all despair: Pleas'd Eccho still does on them meditate, And to the whistling Reeds their sounds repeat. Pan only e're can equal thee in Song, That task does only to great Pan belong: But Pan himself perhaps will fear to try, Will fear perhaps to be out-done by thee. Come all ye Muses, come, adorn the Shepherd's Herse With never-fading Garlands, never-dying Verse. Fair Galatea too laments thy death, Laments the ceasing of thy tuneful breath: Oft she, kind Nymph, resorted heretofore To hear thy artful measures from the shore: Not harsh like the rude Cyclops were thy lays, Whose grating sounds did her soft ears displease: Such was the force of thy enchanting tongue, That she for ever could have heard thy Song, And chid the hours, that did so swiftly run, And thought the Sun too hasty to go down, Now does that lovely Nereid for thy sake The Sea, and all her fellow Nymphs forsake: Pensive upon the Beach, she sits alone, And kindly tends the Flocks from which thou'rt gone. Come all ye Muses, come, adorn the Shepherd's Herse With never-fading Garlands, never-dying Verse. With thee, sweet Bion, all the grace of Song, And all the Muses boasted Art is gone: Mute is thy Voice, which could all hearts command, Whose pow'r no Shepherdess could e're withstand: All the soft weeping Loves about thee moan, At once their Mothers darling, and their own: Dearer wast thou to Venus than her Loves, Than her charm'd Girdle, than her faithful Doves, Than the last gasping Kisses, which in death Adonis gave, and with them gave his breath. This, Thames, ah! this is now the second loss, For which in tears thy weeping Current flows: Spencer, the Muses glory, went before, He pass'd long since to the Elysian shore: For him (they say) for him, thy dear-lov'd Son, Thy Waves did long in sobbing murmurs groan, Long fill'd the Sea with their complaint, and moan: But now, alas! thou do'st afresh bewail, Another Son does now thy sorrow call: To part with either thou alike wast loth, Both dear to Thee, dear to the Fountains both: He largely drank the Rills of sacred Cham, And this no less of Isis nobler stream: He sung of Hero's, and of hardy Knights Far-fam'd in Battels, and renown'd Exploits: This meddled not with bloudy Fights, and Wars, Pan was his Song, and Shepherds harmless jars, Loves peaceful combats, and its gentle cares. Love ever was the subject of his Lays, And his soft Lays did Venus ever please. Come all ye Muses, come adorn the Shepherd's Herse With never-fading Garlands, never-dying Verse. Thou, sacred Bion, art lamented more Than all our tuneful Bards, that dy'd before: Old Chaucer, who first taught the use of Verse, No longer has the tribute of our tears: Milton, whose Muse with such a daring flight Led out the warring Seraphims to fight: Blest Cowley too, who on the banks of Cham So sweetly sigh'd his wrongs, and told his flame: And He, whose Song rais'd Cooper's Hill so high, As made its glory with Parnassus vie: And soft Orinda, whose bright shining name Stands next great Sappho's in the ranks of fame: All now unwept, and unrelented pass, And in our grief no longer share a place: Bion alone does all our tears engross, Our tears are all too few for Bion's loss. Come all ye Muses, come, adorn the Shepherd's Herse With never-fading Garlands, never-dying Verse. Thee all the Herdsmen mourn in gentlest Lays, And rival one another in thy praise: In spreading Letters they engrave thy Name On every Bark, that's worthy of the same: Thy Name is warbled forth by every tongue, Thy Name the Burthen of each Shepherds Song; Waller, the sweet'st of living Bards, prepares For thee his tender'st, and his mournfull'st airs, And I, the meanest of the British Swains, Amongst the rest offer these humble strains: If I am reckon'd not unblest in Song, 'Tis what I ow to thy all-teaching tongue: Some of thy Art, some of thy tuneful breath Thou didst by Will to worthless me bequeath: Others thy Flocks, thy Lands, thy Riches have, To me thou didst thy Pipe, and Skill vouchsafe. Come all ye Muses, come, adorn the Shepherd's Herse With never-fading Garlands, never-dying Verse. Alas! by what ill Fate, to man unkind, Were we to so severe a lot design'd? The meanest Flowers which the Gardens yield, The vilest Weeds that flourish in the Field, Which must e're long lie dead in Winter's Snow, Shall spring again, again more vigorous grow: Yon Sun, and this bright glory of the day, Which night is hasting now to snatch away, Shall rise anew more shining and more gay: But wretched we must harder measure find, The great'st, the brav'st, the witti'st of mankind, When Death has once put out their light, in vain Ever expect the dawn of Life again: In the dark Grave insensible they lie, And there sleep our endless Eternity There thou to silence ever art confin'd, While less deserving Swains are left behind: So please the Fates to deal with us below, They cull out thee, and let dull Mœvius go: Mœvius still lives; still let him live for me, He, and his Pipe shall ne'r my envy be: None e're that heard thy sweet, thy Artful Tongue, Will grate their ears with his rough untun'd Song. Come all ye Muses, come, adorn the Shepherd's Herse With never-fading Garlands, never-dying Verse. A fierce Disease, sent by ungentle Death, Snatch'd Bion hence, and stop'd his hallow'd breath: A fatal damp put out that heav'nly sire, That sacred heat which did his breast inspire. Ah! what malignant ill could boast that pow'r, Which his sweet voice's Magick could not cure? Ah cruel Fate! how could'st thou chuse but spare? How could'st thou exercise thy rigour here? Would thou hadst thrown thy Dart at worthless me, And let this dear, this valued life go free: Better ten thousand meaner Swains had dy'd, Than this best work of Nature been destroy'd. Come, all ye Muses, come, adorn the Shepherd's Herse With never-fading Garlands, never-dying Verse. Ah! would kind Death alike had sent me hence; But grief shall do the work, and save its pains: Grief shall accomplish my desired doom, And soon dispatch me to Elysium: There, Bion, would I be, there gladly know, How with thy voice thou charm'st the shades below. Sing, Shepherd, sing one of thy strains divine, Such as may melt the fierce Elysian Queen: She once her self was pleas'd with tuneful strains, And sung, and danc'd on the Sicilian Plains: Fear not, thy Song should unsuccessful prove, Fear not, but 'twill the pitying Goddess move: She once was won by Orpheus heav'nly Lays, And gave his fair Eurydice release. And thine as pow'rful (question not, dear Swain) Shall bring thee back to these glad Hills again. Ev'n I my self, did I at all excel, Would try the utmost of my voice and skill, Would try to move the rigid King of Hell. The Lamentation for ADONIS. Imitated out of the Greek of Bion of Smyrna. PASTORAL. I mourn Adonis, fair Adonis dead, He's dead, and all that's lovely, with him fled: Come all ye Loves, come hither and bemoan The charming sweet Adonis dead and gone: Rise from thy Purple Bed, and rich Alcove, Throw off thy gay attire, great Queen of Love: Henceforth in sad and mournful weeds appear, And all the marks of grief, and sorrow wear, And tear thy locks, and beat thy panting breast, And cry, My dear Adonis is deceast. I mourn Adonis, the soft Loves bemoan The gentle sweet Adonis dead and gone. On the cold Mountain lies the wretched Youth, Kill'd by a Savage Boar's unpitying tooth: In his white thigh the fatal stroke is found, Nor whiter was that tooth, that gave the wound: From the wide wound fast flows the streaming gore And stains that skin which was all snow before: His breath with quick short tremblings comes and goes, And Death his fainting eyes begins to close: From his pale lips the ruddy colour's fled, Fled, and has left his kisses cold and dead: Yet Venus never will his kisses leave, The Goddess ever to his lips will cleave: The kiss of her dear Youth does please her still, But her poor Youth does not the pleasure feel: Dead he feels not her love, feels not her grief, Feels not her kiss, which might ev'n life retrieve. I mourn Adonis the sad Loves bemoan The comely fair Adonis dead and gone. Deep in his Thigh, deep went the killing smart, But deeper far it goes in Venus heart: His faithful Dogs about the Mountain yell, And the hard Fate of their dead Master tell: The troubled Nymphs alike in doleful strains Proclaim his death through all the Fields &amp; Plains: But the sad Goddess, most of all forlorn, With love distracted, and with sorrow torn, Wild in her look, and ruful in her air, With Garments rent, and with dishevel'd hair, Through Brakes, through Thickets, and through pathless ways, Through Woods, through Haunts, and Dens of Savages, Undrest, unshod, careless of Honour, Fame, And Danger, flies, and calls on his lov'd name. Rude Brambles, as she goes, her body tear, And her cut feet with bloud the stones besmear. She thoughtless of the unfelt smart flies on, And fills the Woods, and Vallies with her moan, Loudly does on the Stars and Fates complain, And prays them give Adonis back again: But he, alass! the wretched Youth, alas! Lies cold, and stiff, extended on the grass: There lies he steep'd in gore, there lies he drown'd, In purple streams, that gush from his own wound. All the soft band of Loves their Mother mourn, At once of beauty, and of love forlorn. Venus has lost her Lover, and each grace, That sate before in triumph in her face, By grief chas'd thence, has now forsook the place. That day which snatch'd Adonis from her arms, That day bereft the Goddess of her charms. The Woods and Trees in murmuring sighs bemoan The fate of her Adonis dead and gone. The Rivers too, as if they would deplore His death, with grief swell higher than before: The Flowers weep in tears of dreary dew, And by their drooping heads their sorrow shew: But most the Cyprian Queen with shrieks, and groans, Fills all the neighb'ring Hills, and Vales, and Towns: The poor Adonis dead! is all her cry, Adonis dead! sad Eccho does reply. What cruel heart would not the Queen of Love To melting tears, and soft compassion move, When she saw how her wretched Lover fell, Saw his deep wound, saw it incurable? Soon as her eyes his bleeding wounds survey'd, With eager clips she did his Limbs invade, And these soft, tender, mournful things she said: “Whither, O whither fli'st thou, wretched Boy, “Stay my Adonis, stay my only joy, “O stay, unhappy Youth, at least till I “With one kind word bespeak thee, e're thou die, “Till I once more embrace thee, till I seal “Upon thy dying lips my last farewel. “Look up one minute, give one parting kiss, “One kiss, dear Youth, to dry these flowing eyes: “One kiss as thy last Legacy I'd fain “Preserve, no God shall take it off again. “Kiss, while I watch thy swimming eye-balls roul, “Watch thy last gasp, and catch thy springing soul. “I'll suck it in, I'll hoard it in my heart, “I with that sacred pledg will never part, “But thou wilt part, but thou art gone, far gone “To the dark shades, and leav'st me here alone. “Thou dy'st, but hopeless I must suffer life, “Must pine away with easless endless grief. “Why was I born a Goddess? why was I “Made such a wretch to want the pow'r to die? “If I by death my sorrows might redress, “If the cold Grave could to my pains give ease, “I'd gladly die, I'd rather nothing be “Than thus condemn'd to immortality: “In that vast empty void, and boundless wast, “We mind not what's to come, nor what is past. “Of life, or death we know no difference, “Nor hopes, nor fears at all affect our sense: “But those who are of pleasure once bereft, “And must survive, are most unhappy left: “To ravenous sorrow they are left a prey, “Nor can they ever drive despair away. “Take, cruel Proserpine, take my lov'd Boy, “Rich with my spoils, do thou my loss enjoy. “Take him relentless Goddess, for thy own, “Never till now wast thou my envy grown. “Hard Fate! that thus the best of things must be “Always the plunder of the Grave, and thee: “The Grave, and thou now all my hopes engross, “And I for ever must Adonis lose. “Thou'rt dead, alas! alas! my Youth, thou'rt dead, “And with thee all my pleasures too are fled: “They're all like fleeting vanish'd dreams pass'd o're, “And nought but the remembrance left in store “Of tasted joys ne're to be tasted more: “With thee my Cestos, all my charms are gone, “Thy Venus must thy absence ever moan, “And spend the tedious live-long nights alone. “Ah! heedless Boy, why would'st thou rashly choose “Thy self to dang'rous pleasures to expose? “Why would'st thou hunt? why would'st thou any more “Venture with Dogs to chase the foaming Boar? “Thou wast all fair to mine, to humane eyes, “But not (alas!) to those wild Savages. “One would have thought thy sweetness might have charm'd “The roughest kind, the fiercest rage disarm'd: “Mine (I am sure) it could; but wo is thee! “All wear not eyes, all wear not breasts like me. In such sad words the Dame her grief did vent, While the Wing'd Loves kept time with her complaint: As many drops of Bloud as from the wound Of slain Adonis fell upon the ground, So many tears, and more you might have told, That down the cheeks of weeping Venus roul'd: Both tears, and bloud to new-born flow'rs give rise, Hence Roses spring, and thence Anemonies. Cease, Venus, in the Woods to mourn thy Love, Thou'st vented sighs, thou'st lavish'd tears enough: See! Goddess, where a glorious bed of State Does ready for thy dear Adonis wait: This bed was once the Scene of Love, and Joy, But now must bear the wretched, murder'd Boy: There lies he, like a pale, and wither'd Flower, Which some rude hand had cropt before its hour: Yet smiles, and beauties still live in his face, Which death can never frighten from their place. There let him lie upon that conscious bed, Where you loves mysteries so oft have tried: When you've enjoy'd so many an happy night, Each lengthen'd into ages of delight. There let him lie, there heaps of Flowers strow, Roses and Lillies store upon him throw, And myrtle Garlands lavishly bestow: Pour Myrrh, and Balm, and costliest Ointments on, Flowers are faded, Ointments worthless grown, Now thy Adonis, now thy Youth is gone, Who was all sweetnesses compriz'd in one. In Purple wrapt, Adonis lies in state, A Troop of mourning Loves about him wait: Each does some mark of their kind sorrow show, One breaks his Shafts, t'other unstrings his Bow, A third upon his Quiver wreaks his hate, As the sad causes of his hasty fate: This plucks his bloudy garments off, that brings Water in Vessels from the neighb'ring Springs, Some wash his Wound, some fan him with their Wings: All equally their Mothers loss bemoan, All moan for poor Adonis dead and gone. Sad Hymen too the fatal loss does mourn, His Tapers all to Funeral Tapers turn, And all his wither'd Nuptial Garlands burn: His gay, and airy Songs are heard no more, But mournful Strains, that hopeless love deplore. Nor do the Graces fail to bear a part With wretched Venus in her pain and smart: The poor Adonis dead! by turns they cry, And strive in grief the Goddess to out-vie. The Muses too in softest Lays bewail The hapless Youth, and his fled Soul recal: But all in vain;—ah! numbers are too weak To call the lost, the dead Adonis back: Not all the pow'rs of Verse, or charms of Love The deaf remorsless Proserpine can move. Cease then, sad Queen of Love, thy plaints give o're, Till the next year reserve thy grief in store: Reserve thy Sighs, and tears in store till then, Then thou must sigh, then thou must weep agen. Paraphrase upon the 137. Psalm. 1. Ver. 1. Far from our pleasant native Palestine, Where great Euphrates with a mighty current flows, And does in watry limits Babylon confine, Curss'd Babylon! the cause, and author of our woes; There on the Rivers side Sate wretched, Captive we. And in sad Tears bewail'd our misery. Tears, whose vast store increas'd the neighb'ring Tide: We wept, and strait our grief before us brought A thousand distant Objects to our thought. As oft as we survey'd the gliding Stream, Lov'd Jordan did our sad remembrance claim: As oft as we th' adjoyning City view'd, Dear Sions razed Walls our Grief renew'd: We thought on all the Pleasures of our happy Land, Late ravish'd by a cruel Conqu'rour's hand: We thought on every piteous, every mournful thing, That might access to our enlarged sorrows bring; 2. Deep silence told the greatness of our Grief, Of grief too great by Vent to find relief: Our Harps as mute and dumb, as we, Hung useless, and neglected by, And now and then a broken String would lend a sigh, As if with us they felt a sympathy, And mourn'd their own, and our Captivity: The gentle River too, as if compassionate grown, As 'twould its Natives cruelty attone, As it pass'd by, in murmurs gave a pitying Groan. 2. 3. There the proud Conquerors, who gave us Chains, Who all our suff'rings and misfortunes gave, Did with rude Insolence our Sorrows brave, And with insulting Raillery thus mock'd our Pains; Play us (said they) some brisk, and airy strain, Such as your Ancestors were wont to hear On Shilo's pleasant Plain, Where all the Virgins met in Dances once a year: Or one of those, Which your illustrious David did compose, While he fill'd Israel's happy Throne, Great Soldier, Poet, and Musician all in one: Oft (have we heard) he went with Harp in hand, Captain of all th' harmonious Band, And vanquish'd all the Quire with's single skill alone: 4. Forbid it Heav'n! forbid thou great thrice-hallow'd Name, We should thy Sacred Hymns defame, Or them with impious ears profane. No, no, inhumane slaves, is this a time (Oh cruel, and preposterous demand!) When every Joy, and every Smile's a crime, A Treason to our poor unhappy native Land? Is this a time for sprightly Airs, When every look the Badg of sorrow wears, And Livery of our Miseries, Sad miseries that call for all our Breath in sighs, And all the Tribute of our eyes, And moisture of our Veins our very bloud in tears? When nought can claim our Thoughts, Jerusalem, but thou, Nought, but thy sad Destruction, Fall, and Overthrow? 3. 5. Oh dearest City! late our Nations justest Pride! Envy of all the wond'ring world beside! Oh sacred Temple, once th' Almighty's bless'd abode, Now quite forsaken by our angry God! Shall ever distant time, or Place Your firm Ideas from my Soul deface? Shall they not still take up my Breast As long as that, and Life, and I shall last? Grant Heav'n (nor shall my Pray'rs the Curse withstand) That this my learned, skilful hand (Which now o're all the tuneful strings can boast command, Which does as quick, as ready, and unerring prove, As nature, when it would its joynts or fingers move) Grant it forget its Art and feeling too, When I forget to think, to wish, to pray for you: 6. For ever tied with Dumbness be my tongue, When it speaks ought that shall not to your Praise belong, If that be not the constant subject of my Muse, and Song. 4. 7. Remember, Heav'n, remember Edom on that day, And with like sufferings their spight repay, Who made our Miseries their cruel Mirth and Scorn, Who laugh'd to see our flaming City burn, And wish'd it might to Ashes turn: Raze, raze it (was their cursed cry) Raze all its stately Structures down, And lay its Palaces, and Temple level with the ground, Till Sion buried in his dismal Ruines lie, Forgot alike its Place, its Name, and Memory. 8. And thou proud Babylon! just Object of our Hate, Thou too shalt feel the sad reverse of Fate, Tho thou art now exalted high, And with thy lofty head o'retop'st the Sky, As if thou would'st the Pow'rs above defie; Thou (if those Pow'rs (and sure they will) prove just, If my Prophetick Grief can ought foresee) Ere long shalt lay that lofty head in dust, And blush in Bloud for all thy present Cruelty: How loudly then shall we retort these bitter Taunts! How gladly to the Musick of thy Fetters dance! 5. A day will come (oh might I see't!) e're long That shall revenge our mighty wrong: Then bless'd, for ever bless'd be he Whoever shall return't on thee, And grave it deep, and pay't with bloudy Usury: May neither aged Groans, nor Infant Cries, Nor pitious Mothers Tears, nor ravish'd Virgins Sighs, Soften thy unrelenting Enemies, Let them as thou to us inexorable prove, Nor Age nor Sex their deaf Compassion move; Rapes, Murders, Slaughters, Funerals, And all thou durst attempt within our Sions Wall, May'st thou endure, and more, till joyful we Confess thy self out-done in artful cruelty. Bless'd, yea, thrice blessed be that barbarous Hand (Oh grief, that I such dire Revenge commend!) Who tears out Infants from their Mothers Womb, And hurls them yet unborn unto their Tomb: Bless'd he who plucks them from their Parents Arms, That Sanctuary from all common harms, Who with their Skulls, and Bones shall pave thy Streets all o're, And fill thy glutted Channels with their scatter'd Brains and Gore. Paraphrase upon the HYMN of St. Ambrose. ODE. 1. To Thee, O God, we thy just Praises sing, To Thee we Thy great Name rehearse: We are Thy Vassals, and this humble Tribute bring To Thee, acknowledg'd only Lord and King, Acknowledg'd sole and Sovereign Monarch of the Universe. All parts of this wide Universe adore, Eternal Father, thy Almighty power: The Skies, and Stars, Fire, Air, and Earth, and Sea, With all their numerous nameless Progeny Confess, and their due Homage pay to thee; For why? thou spak'st the Word, and mad'st them all from Nothing be. To thee all Angels, all thy glorious Court on high, Seraph and Cherub, the Nobility, And whatsoever Spirits be Of lesser Honour, less Degree; To Thee in heav'nly Lays They sing loud Anthems of immortal Praise: Still Holy, Holy, Holy Lord of Hosts they cry, This is their bus'ness, this their sole employ, And thus they spend their long and blest Eternity. 2. Farther than Natures utmost shores and limits stretch The streams of thy unbounded Glory reach; Beyond the straits of scanty Time, and Place, Beyond the ebbs and flows of matter's narrow Seas They reach, and fill the Ocean of Eternity and Space. Infus'd like some vast mighty soul, Thou do'st inform and actuate this spacious whole: Thy unseen hand does the well-joynted Frame sustain, Which else would to its primitive Nothing shrink again. But most thou do'st thy Majesty display In the bright Realms of everlasting Day: There is Thy residence, there do'st Thou reign, There on a State of dazling Lustre sit, There shine in Robes of pure refined Light; Where Sun's coarse Rays are but a Foil and Stain, And refuse Stars the sweepings of thy glorious Train. 3. There all Thy Family of menial Saints, Huge Colonies of bless'd Inhabitants, Which Death through countless Ages has transplanted hence, Now on Thy Throne for ever wait, And fill the large Retinue of thy heav'nly State. There reverend Prophets stand, a pompous goodly show, Of old thy Envoys extraordinary here, Who brought thy sacred Embassies of Peace and War, That to th' obedient, this the rebel world below. By them the mighty Twelve have their abode, Companions once of the Incarnate suff'ring God, Partakers now of all his Triumphs there, As they on earth did in his Miseries share. Of Martyrs next a crown'd and glorious Quire, Illustrious Heroes, who have gain'd Through dangers, and Red Seas of Bloud the Promis'd Land, And pass'd through Ordeal Flames to the Eternity in Fire. There all make up the Consort of thy Praise, To Thee they sing (and never cease) Loud Hymns, and Hallelujah's of Applause: An Angel-Laureat does the Sense and Strains compose, Sense far above the reach of mortal Verse, Strains far above the reach of mortal ears, And all, a Muse unglorified can fancy, or rehearse. 4. Nor is this Consort only kept above, Nor is it to the Bless'd alone confin'd; But Earth, and all thy Faithful here are joyn'd, And strive to vie with them in Duty and in Love: And, tho they cannot equal Notes and Measures raise, Strive to return th' imperfect Ecchoes of thy Praise. They through all Nations own thy glorious Name, And every where the great Three One proclaim, Thee, Father of the World, and Us, and Him, Who must Mankind, whom Thou didst make, Redeem, Thee, blessed Saviour, the ador'd, true, only Son To man debas'd, to rescue Man undone: And Thee, Eternal, Holy Power, Who do'st by Grace exalted Man restore To all, he lost by the old Fall, and Sin before: You bless'd and glorious Trinity, Riddle to baffled Knowledg and Philosophy, Which cannot conprehend the mighty Mystery Of numerous One, and the unnumber'd Three Vast topless Pile of Wonders! at whose sight Reason it self turns giddy with the height, Above the flutt'ring pitch of humane Wit, And all, but the strong wings of Faith, that Eagle's towring flight. 5. Bless'd Jesu! how shall we enough adore, Or thy unbounded Love, or thy unbounded Pow'r? Thou art the Prince of Heav'n, thou are the Almighty's Heir, Thou art th' Eternal Off-spring of th' Eternal Sire: Hail thou the Worlds Redeemer! whom to free From bonds of Death and endless misery, Thou thought'st it no disdain to be Inhabiter in low mortality: Th' Almighty thought it no disdain To dwell in the pure Virgins spotless Womb, There did the boundless Godhead, and whole Heav'n find room, And a small point the Circle of Infinity contain. Hail Ransom of Mankind, all-great, all-good! Who didst attone us with thy Bloud, Thy self the Offering, Altar, Priest, and God: Thy self didst die to be our glorious Bail From Death's Arrests, and the eternal Flaming Jail: Thy self thou gav'st th' inestimable Price, To Purchase and Redeem our morgag'd Heav'n and Happiness. Thither, when thy great Work on Earth had end, When Death it self was slain and dead, And Hell with all its Powers captive led, Thou didst again triumphantly Ascend: There do'st Thou now by Thy great Father sit on high, With equal Glory, equal Majesty, Joynt-Ruler of the everlasting Monarchy. 6. Again from thence thou shalt with greater triumph come, When the last Trumpet sounds the general Doom: And (lo!) thou com'st, and (lo!) the direful sound does make Through Deaths wide Realm Mortality awake: And (lo) they all appear At Thy Dread Bar, And all receive th' unalterable Sentence there. Affrighted Nature trembles at the dismal Day, And shrinks for fear, and vanishes away: Both that, and Time breath out their last, and now they die, And now are swallow'd up and lost in vast Eternity. Mercy, O mercy, angry God! Stop, stop thy flaming Wrath, too fierce to be withstood, And quench it with the Deluge of thy Bloud; Thy precious Bloud which was so freely spilt To wash us from the stains of Sin and Guilt: O write us with it in the Book of Fate Amongst thy Chosen, and Predestinate, Free Denizens of Heav'n, of the Immortal State. 7. Guide us, O Saviour! guide thy Church below, Both Way, and Star, Compass, and Pilot Thou: Do thou this frail and tott'ring Vessel steer Through Life's tempestuous Ocean here, Through all the tossing Waves of Fear, And dang'rous Rocks of black Despair. Safe under Thee we shall to the wish'd Haven move, And reach the undiscover'd Lands of Bliss above, Thus low (behold!) to thy great Name we bow, And thus we ever wish to grow: Constant, as Time does thy fix'd Laws obey, To Thee our Worship and our Thanks we pay: With these we wake the chearful Light, With these we Sleep, and Rest invite; And thus we spend our Breath, and thus we spend our Days, And never cease to Sing, and never cease to Praise. 8. While thus each Breast, and Mouth, and Ear Are filled with thy Praise, and Love, and Fear, Let never Sin get room, or entrance there: Vouchsafe, O Lord, through this and all our days To guard us with Thy pow'rful Grace: Within our hearts let no usurping Lust be found, No rebel Passion tumult raise, To break thy Laws, or break our Peace, But set thy Watch of Angels on the Place, And keep the Tempter still from that forbidden ground. Ever, O Lord, to us thy mercies grant, Never, O Lord, let us thy mercies want, Ne're want Thy Favour, Bounty, Liberality, But let them ever on us be, Constant as our own Hope and Trust on Thee: On Thee we all our Hope and Trust repose; O never leave us to our Foes, Never, O Lord, desert our Cause: Thus aided and upheld by Thee, We'll fear no Danger, Death, nor Misery; Fearless we thus will stand a falling world With crushing Ruins all about us hurl'd, And face wide gaping Hell, &amp; all its slighted Pow'rs defie. A Letter from the Country to a Friend in Town, giving an Account of the Author's Inclinations to Poetry. Written in July, 1678. As to that Poet (if so great a one, as he, May suffer in comparison with me) When heretofore in Scythian exile pent, To which he to ungrateful Rome was sent. If a kind Paper from his Country came, And wore subscrib'd some known, and faithful Name; That like a pow'rful Cordial, did infuse New life into his speechless gasping Muse, And strait his Genius, which before did seem Bound up in Ice, and frozen as the Clime, By its warm force, and friendly influence thaw'd, Dissolv'd apace, and in soft numbers flow'd: Such welcome here, dear Sir, your Letter had With me shut up in close constraint as bad: Not eager Lovers, held in long suspence, With warmer Joy, and a more tender sense Meet those kind Lines, which all their wishes bless, And Sign, and Seal deliver'd Happiness: My grateful Thoughts so throng to get abroad, They over-run each other in the crowd: To you with hasty flight they take their way, And hardly for the dress of words will stay. Yet pardon, if this only fault I find, That while you praise too much, you are less kind: Consider, Sir, 'tis ill and dang'rous thus To over-lay a young and tender Muse: Praise, the fine Diet, which we're apt to love, If given to excess, does hurtful prove: Where it does weak, distemper'd Stomachs meet That surfeits, which should nourishment create. Your rich Perfumes such fragrancy dispense, Their sweetness overcomes, and palls my sense; On my weak head you heap so many Bays, I sink beneath 'em, quite oppress'd with Praise, And a resembling fate with him receive, Who in too kind a triumph found his Grave, Smother'd with Garlands, which Applauders gave. To you these Praises justlier all belong, By alienating which, your self you wrong: Whom better can such commendations fit Than you, who so well teach and practise Wit? Verse, the great boast of drudging Fools, from some, May most of Scriblers with much straining come: They void 'em dribling, and in pain they write, As if they had a Strangury of Wit: Your Pen uncall'd they readily obey, And scorn your Ink should flow so fast as they: Each strain of yours so easie does appear, Each such a graceful negligence does wear, As shews you have none, and yet want no care. None of your serious pains or time they cost, But what thrown by, you can afford for lost: If such the fruits of your loose leisure be, Your careless minutes yield such Poetry; We guess what proofs your Genius would impart, Did it employ you, as it does divert: But happy you, more prudent, and more wise, With better aims have fix'd your noble choice. While silly I all thriving Arts refuse, And all my hopes, and all my vigour lose, In service on that worst of Jilts, a Muse, For gainful business court ignoble ease, And in gay Trifles wast my ill-spent days. Little I thought, my dearest Friend, that you Would thus contribute to my Ruine too: O're-run with filthy Poetry, and Rhyme, The present reigning evil of the time, I lack'd, and (well I did my self assure) From your kind hand I should receive a cure: When (lo!) instead of healing Remedies, You cherish, and encourage the Disease: Inhumane you help the Distemper on, Which was before but too inveterate grown. As a kind looker on, who int'rest shares, Tho not in's stake, yet in his hopes and fears, Would to his Friend a pushing Gamester do, Recall his Elbow when he hastes to throw; Such a wise course you should have took with me. A rash and vent'ring fool in Poetry. Poets are Cullies, whom Rook Fame draws in, And wheadles with deluding hopes to win: But, when they hit, and most successful are, They scarce come off with a bare saving share. Oft (I remember) did wise Friends dissuade, And bid me quit the trifling barren Trade. Oft have I tried (Heav'n knows) to mortifie This vile, and wicked lust of Poetry: But still unconquer'd it remains within, Fix'd as an Habit, or some darling Sin. In vain I better studies there would sow, Often I've tried, but none will thrive, or grow: All my best thoughts, when I'd most serious be, Are never from its foul infection free: Nay (God forgive me) when I say my Prayers, I scarce can help polluting them with Verse: That fabulous Wretch of old revers'd I seem, Who turn whate're I touch to Dross and Rhyme. Oft to divert the wild Caprice, I try If Sovereign Wisdom and Philosophy Rightly applied, will give a remedy: Strait the great Stagyrite I take in hand, Seek Nature, and my Self to understand: Much I reflect on his vast Worth and Fame, And much my low, and groveling aims condemn, And quarrel, that my ill-pack'd Fate should be This vain, this worthless thing call'd Poetry: But when I find this unregarded Toy Could his important Thoughts, and Pains employ, By reading there I am but more undone, And meet that danger, which I went to shun. Oft when ill Humour, Shagrin, Discontent Give leisure my wild Follies to resent, I thus against my self my Passion vent. “Enough, mad rhiming Sot, enough for shame, “Give o're, and all thy Quills to Tooth-picks Damn; “Didst ever thou the Altar rob, or worse, “Kill the Priest there, and Maids receiving force? “What else could merit this so heavy Curse? “The greatest Curse, I can, I wish on him, “If there be any greater than to rhime) “Who first did of the lewd invention think, “First made two lines with sounds resembling clink, “And, swerving from the easie paths of Prose, “Fetters, and Chains did on free Sense impose: “Curs'd too be all the fools, who since have went “Misled in steps of that ill President: “Want be entail'd their lot:—and on I go, Wreaking my spight on all the jingling Crew: Scarce the beloved Cowley scapes, tho I Might sooner my own curses fear, than he: And thus resolv'd against the scribling vein, I deeply swear never to write again. But when bad Company and Wine conspire To kindle, and renew the foolish Fire, Straitways relaps'd, I feel the raving fit Return, and strait I all my Oaths forget: The Spirit, which I thought cast out before, Enters again with stronger force, and power, Worse than at first, and tyrannizes more. No sober good advice will then prevail, Nor from the raging Frenzy me recal: Cool Reason's dictates me no more can move Than men in Drink, in Bedlam, or in Love: Deaf to all means which might most proper seem Towards my cure, I run stark mad in Rhime: A sad poor haunted wretch, whom nothing less Than Prayers of the Church can dispossess. Sometimes, after a tedious day half spent, When Fancy long has hunted on cold Scent, Tir'd in the dull, and fruitless chase of Thought, Despairing I grow weary, and give out: As a dry Lecher pump'd of all my store, I loath the thing, 'cause I can do't no more: But, when I once begin to find again, Recruits of matter in my pregnant Brain, Again more eager I the haunt pursue, And with fresh vigour the lov'd sport renew: Tickled with some strange pleasure, which I find, And think a secresie to all mankind, I please my self with the vain, false delight, And count none happy, but the Fops that write. 'Tis endless, Sir, to tell the many ways, Wherein my poor deluded self I please: How, when the Fancy lab'ring for a Birth, With unfelt Throws brings its rude issue forth: How after, when imperfect shapeless Thought Is by the Judgment into Fashion wrought. When at first search I traverse o're my mind, Nought but a dark, and empty Void I find: Some little hints at length, like sparks, break thence, And glimm'ring Thoughts just dawning into sense: C?fus'd a while the mixt Idea's lie, With nought of mark to be discover'd by, Like colours undistinguish'd in the night, Till the dusk Images, mov'd to the light, Teach the discerning Faculty to chuse, Which it had best adopt, and which refuse. Here rougher strokes, touch'd with a careless dash, Resemble the first sitting of a face: There finish'd draughts in form more full appear, And to their justness ask no further care. Mean while with inward joy I proud am grown, To see the work successfully go on: And prize my self in a creating power, That could make something, what was nought before. Sometimes a stiff, unwieldy thought I meet, Which to my Laws will scarce be made submit: But, when, after expence of pains and time, 'Tis manag'd well, and taught to yoke in Rhime, I triumph more, than joyful Warriours wou'd, Had they some stout, and hardy Foe subdu'd: And idly think, less goes to their Command, That makes arm'd Troops in well-plac'd order stand, Than to the conduct of my words, when they March in due ranks, are set in just array. Sometimes on wings of Thought I seem on high, As men in sleep, though motionless they lie, Fledg'd by a Dream, believe they mount and fly: So Witches some enchanted Wand bestride, And think they through the airy Regions ride, Where Fancy is both Traveller, Way, and Guide: Then strait I grow a strange exalted thing, And equal in conceit, at least a King: As the poor Drunkard, when Wine stums his brains, Anointed with that Liquor, thinks he reigns. Bewitch'd by these Delusions 'tis I write, (The tricks some pleasant Devil plays in spight) And when I'm in the freakish Trance, which I Fond silly Wretch, mistake for Extasie, I find all former Resolutions vain, And thus recant them, and make new again. “What was't, I rashly vow'd? shall ever I “Quit my beloved Mistris, Poetry? “Thou sweet beguiler of my lonely hours, “Which thus glide unperceiv'd with silent course: “Thou gentle Spell, which undisturb'd do'st keep “My Breast, and charm intruding care asleep: “They say, thou'rt poor, and unendow'd, what tho? “For thee I this vain, worthless world forgo: “Let Wealth, and Honour be for Fortunes Slaves, “The Alms of Fools, and Prize of crafty Knaves: “To me thou art, whate're th' ambitious crave, “And all that greedy Misers want, or have: “In Youth, or Age, in Travel, or at Home, “Here, or in Town, at London, or at Rome, “Rich, or a Beggar, free, or in the Fleet, “Whate're my Fate is, 'tis my Fate to write. Thus I have made my shrifted Muse confess, Her secret Feebless, and her Weaknesses: All her hid Faults she sets expos'd to view, And hopes a gentle Confessor in you: She hopes an easie pardon for her sin, Since 'tis but what she is not wilful in, Nor yet has scandalous nor open been. Try if your ghostly counsel can reclaim The heedless wanton from her guilt and shame: At least be not ungenerous to reproach That wretched frailty, which you've help'd debauch. 'Tis now high time to end, for fear I grow More tedious than old Doaters, when they woo, Than travel'd Fops, when far-fetch'd lies they prate. Or flatt'ring Poets, when they dedicate No dull forgiveness I presume to crave, Nor vainly for my tiresom length ask leave: Lest I, as often formal Coxcombs use. Prolong that very fault, I would excuse May this the same kind welcome find with you As yours did here, and ever shall; Adieu. Upon a Printer that exposed him by Printing a Piece of his grosly mangled, and faulty. Dull, and unthinking! hadst thou none but me To plague, and urge to thine own Infamy? Had I some tame and sneaking Author been, Whose Muse to Love, and softness did incline, Some small Adventurer in Song, that whines Chloris and Phyllis out in charming lines, Fit to divert mine Hostess, and mislead The heart of some poor tawdry Waiting Maid; Perhaps I might have then forgiven thee, And thou hadst scap'd from my resentments free. But I whom spleen, and manly rage inspire, Brook no affront, at each offence take fire: Born to chastise the Vices of the Age, Which Pulpits dare not, nor the very Stage: Sworn to lash Knaves of all degrees, and spare None of the kind, however great they are: Satyr's my only Province, and delight, For whose dear sake alone I've vow'd to write: For this I seek occasions, court Abuse, To shew my Parts, and signalize my Muse: Fond of a Quarrel, as young Bullies are To make their Mettle, and their Skill appear: And didst thou think I would a wrong acquit, That touch'd my tender'st part of Honour, Wit? No, Villain, may my Sins ne're pardon'd be By Heav'n it self, if e're I pardon thee. Members from breach of Privilege deter By threatning Topham and a Messenger: Scroggs, and the Brothers of the Coif oppose, By force and dint of Statutes, and the Laws: Strumpets of Billingsgate redress their wrongs By the sole noise, and foulness of their Tongues: And I go always arm'd for my defence, To punish, and revenge an insolence. I wear my Pen, as others do their Sword, To each affronting Sot, I meet, the word Is Satisfaction: strait to Thrusts I go, And pointed Satyr runs him through and through. Perhaps thou hop'dst that thy obscurity Should be thy safeguard, and secure thee free. No, wretch, I mean from thence to fetch thee out, Like sentenc'd Felons, to be drag'd about: Torn, mangled, and expos'd to scorn, and shame, I mean to hang, and Gibbet up thy Name. If thou to live in Satyr so much thirst, Enjoy thy wish, and Fame, till envy burst, Renown'd, as he, whom banish'd Ovid curst: Or he, whom old Archilochus so stung In Verse, that he for shame, and madness hung: Deathless in infamy, do thou so live, And let my Rage, like his, to Halters drive. Thou thoughtst perhaps my Gall was spent and gone, My Venom drain'd, and I a stingless Drone: Thou thoughtst I had no Curses lest in store; But to thy sorrow know, and find I've more, More, and more dreadful yet, able to scare, Like Hell, and urge to Daggers, and Despair: Such thou shalt feel, are still reserv'd by me, To vex and force thee to thy Destiny: Since thou hast brav'd my vengeance thus; prepare, And tremble from my Pen thy Doom to hear. Thou, who with spurious Nonsense durst profane The genuine issue of a Poets Brain, May'st thou hereafter never deal in Verse, But what hoarse Bell-men in their Walks rehearse, Or Smithfield Audience sung on Crickets hears: May'st thou print H?, or some duller Ass, Jordan, or Him, that wrote Dutch Hudibrass: Or next vile Scribler of the House, whose Play Will scarce for Candles, and their snuffing pay: May you each other Curse; thy self undone, And he the laughing-stock of all the Town. May'st thou ne're rise to History, but what Poor Grubstreet Peny Chroniclers relate, Memoirs of Tyburn, and the mournful State Of Cut-purses in Holborn Cavalcade, Till thou thy self be the same subject made. Compell'd by want, may'st thou Print Popery, For which be the Carts Arse, and Pillory, Turnips, and rotten Eggs thy destiny. Maul'd worse than Reading, Christian, or Cellier, Till thou daub'd o're with loathsom filth, appear Like Brat of some vile Drab in Privy found, Which there has lain three months in Ordure drown'd. The Plague of Poets, Rags, and Poverty, Debts, Writs, Arrests, and Serjeants light on thee: For others bound, may'st thou to Durance go, Condemn'd to Scraps, and begging with a Shoo: And may'st thou never from the Jail get free, Till thou swear out thy self by Perjury: Forlorn, abandon'd, pitiless, and poor, As a pawn'd Cully, or a mortgag'd Whore, May'st thou an Halter want for thy Redress, Forc'd to steal Hemp to end thy miseries, And damn thy self to balk the Hangmans Fees. And may no saucy Fool have better Fate That dares pull down the Vengeance of my Hate. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Book III.] POEMS, AND Translations. By the Author of The Satyrs upon the Jesuits. THE EIGHTH SATYR OF Monsieur BOILEAU, Imitated. Written in October, 1682. The POET brings himself in, as discoursing with a Doctor of the University upon the Subject ensuing. Of all the Creatures in the world that be, Beast, Fish, or Fowl, that go, or swim, or fly Throughout the Globe from London to Japan, The arrant'st Fool in my opinion's Man. What? (strait I'm taken up) an Ant, a Fly, A tiny Mite, which we can hardly see Without a Perspective, a silly Ass, Or freakish Ape? Dare you affirm, that these Have greater sense than Man? Ay, questionless. Doctor, I find you're shock'd at this discourse: Man is (you cry) Lord of the Universe; For him was this fair frame of Nature made, And all the Creatures for his use, and aid: To him alone of all the living kind, Has bounteous Heav'n the reas'ning gift assign'd. True Sir, that Reason ever was his lot, But thence I argue Man the greater Sot. This idle talk, (say you) and rambling stuff May pass in Satyr, and take well enough With Sceptick Fools, who are dispos'd to jeer At serious things: but you must make't appear By solid proof. Believe me, Sir, I'll do't: Take you the Desk, and let's dispute it out. Then by your favour, tell me first of all, What 'tis, which you grave Doctors Wisdom call? You answer: 'Tis an evenness of Soul, A steddy temper, which no cares controul, No passions ruffle, nor desires inflame, Still constant to its self, and still the same, That does in all its slow Resolves advance, With graver steps, than Benchers, when they dance. Most true; yet is not this, I dare maintain, Less us'd by any, than the Fool, call'd Man. The wiser Emmet, quoted just before, In Summer time ranges the Fallows o're With pains, and labour, to lay in his store: But when the blust'ring North with ruffling blasts Saddens the year, and Nature overcasts; The prudent Insect, hid in privacy, Enjoys the fruits of his past industry. No Ant of sense was e're so awkard seen, To drudg in Winter, loiter in the Spring. But sillier man, in his mistaken way, By Reason, his false guide, is led astray: Tost by a thousand gusts of wavering doubt, His restless mind still rolls from thought to thought: In each resolve unsteady, and unfixt, And when he one day loaths, desires the next. Shall I, so fam'd for many a tuant jest On wiving, now go take a jilt at last? Shall I turn Husband, and my station choose, Amongst the reverend Martyrs of the Noose? No, there are fools enough besides in Town, To furnish work for Satyr, and Lampoon: Few months before cried the unthinking Sot, Who quickly after, hamper'd in the knot, Was quoted for an instance by the rest, And bore his Fate, as tamely as the best, And thought, that Heav'n from some miraculous side, For him alone had drawn a faithful Bride. This is our image just: such is that vain, That foolish, fickle, motly Creature, Man: More changing than a Weathercock, his Head Ne'r wakes with the same thoughts, he went to bed, Irksome to all beside, and ill at ease, He neither others, nor himself can please: Each minute round his whirling humours run, Now he's a Trooper, and a Priest anon, To day in Buff, to morrow in a Gown. Yet, pleas'd with idle whimsies of his brain, And puft with pride, this haughty thing would fain Be thought himself the only stay, and prop, That holds the mighty frame of Nature up: The Skies and Stars his properties must seem, And turn-spit Angels tread the Spheres for him: Of all the Creatures he's the Lord (he cries) More absolute, than the French King of his. And who is there (say you) that dares deny So own'd a truth? That may be, Sir, do I. But to omit the controversie here, Whether, if met, the Passenger and Bear, This or the other stands in greater fear. Or if an Act of Parliament should pass That all the Irish Wolves should quit the place, They'd strait obey the Statutes high command, And at a minutes warning rid the Land: This boasted Monarch of the world, that aws The Creatures here, and with his beck gives Laws; This titular King, who thus pretends to be The Lord of all, how many Lords has he? The lust of Money, and the lust of Power, With Love, and Hate, and twenty passions more, Hold him their slave, and chain him to the Oar. Scarce has soft sleep in silence clos'd his eyes, Up! (strait says Avarice) 'tis time to rise. Not yet: one minute longer. Up! (she cries) Th' Exchange, and Shops are hardly open yet. No matter: Rise! But after all, for what? D'ye ask: go, cut the Line, double the Cape, Traverse from end to end the spacious deep: Search both the Indies, Bantam, and Japan: Fetch Sugars from Barbadoes, Wines from Spain. What needs all this? I've wealth enough in store, I thank the Fates, nor care for adding more. You cannot have too much, this point to gain, You must no Crime, no Perjury refrain, Hunger you must endure, Hardship, and Want, Amidst full Barns keep an eternal Lent, And tho you've more than B?m has spent, Or C?n got, like stingy B?el save, And grudg your self the charges of a Grave, And the small Ransom of a single Groat, From Sword, or Halter to redeem your Throat. And pray, why all this sparing? Don't you know? Only t'enrich a spendthrift Heir, or so: Who shall, when you are timely dead, and gone, With his gilt Coach, and Six amuse the Town, Keep his gay brace of Punks, and vainly give More for a night, than you to fine for Shrieve. But you lose time! the Wind, and Vessel waits, Quick, let's aboard! Hey for the Downs, and Streights. Or, if all-powerful Money fail of charms: To tempt the wretch, and push him on to harms: With a strong hand does fierce Ambition seize, And drag him forth from soft repose and ease: Amidst ten thousand dangers spurs him on, With loss of Bloud and Limbs to hunt renown. Who for reward of many a wound and maim, Is paid with nought but wooden Legs, and Fame; And the poor comfort of a grinning Fate, To stand recorded in the next Gazette. But hold (cries one) your paltry gibing wit, Or learn henceforth to aim it more aright: If this be any; 'tis a glorious fault, Which through all Ages has been ever thought The Hero's virtue, and chief excellence: Pray, what was Alexander in your sense? A Fool belike. Yes, faith, Sir, much the same: A crack-brain'd Huff that set the world on flame: A Lunatick broke loose, who in his fit Fell foul on all, invaded all, he met: Who, Lord of the whole Globe, yet not content, Lack'd elbow-room, and seem'd too closely pent. What madness was't, that, born to a fair Throne, Where he might rule with Justice, and Renown, Like a wild Robber, he should choose to roam, A pitied wretch, with neither house, nor home, And hurling War, and Slaughter up and down, Through the wide world make his vast folly known? Happy for ten good reasons had it been, If Macedon had had a Bedlam then: That there with Keepers under close restraint He might have been from frantick mischief pent. But that we mayn't in long digressions now Discourse all Rainolds, and the Passions through, And ranging them in method stiff, and grave, Rhime on by Chapter, and by Paragraph; Let's quit the present Topick of dispute, For More and Cudworth to enlarge about; And take a view of man in his best light, Wherein he seems to most advantage set, 'Tis he alone (you'l say) 'tis happy he, That's fram'd by Nature for Society: He only dwells in Towns, is only seen With Manners and Civility to shine; Does only Magistrates, and Rulers choose, And live secur'd by Government, and Laws. 'Tis granted, Sir; but yet without all these, Without your boasted Laws, and Policies, Or fear of Judges, or of Justices; Who ever saw the Wolves, that he can say, Like more inhumane Us, so bent on prey, To rob their fellow Wolves upon the way? Who ever saw Church and Fanatick Bear, Like savage Mankind one another tear? What Tyger e're, aspiring to be great, In Plots and Factions did embroil the State? Or when was't heard upon the Libian Plains, Where the stern Monarch of the Desert reigns, That Whig and Tory Lions in wild jars Madly engag'd for choice of Shrieves and May'rs? The fiercest Creatures, we in Nature find, Respect their figure still in the same kind; To others rough, to these they gentle be, And live from Noise, from Feuds, from Actions free. No Eagle does upon his Peerage sue, And strive some meaner Eagle to undo: No Fox was e're suborn'd by spite, or hire, Against his brother Fox his life to swear: Nor any Hind, for Impotence at Rut, Did e're the Stag into the Arches put; Where a grave Dean the weighty Case might state, What makes in Law a carnal Job complete: They fear no dreadful Quo Warranto Writ, To shake their ancient privilege and right: No Courts of Sessions, or Assize are there, No Common-Pleas, Kings-Bench, or Chancery-Bar: But happier they, by Natures Charter free, Secure, and safe in mutual peace agree, And know no other Law, but Equity. 'Tis Man, 'tis Man alone, that worst of Brutes, Who first brought up the trade of cutting Throats, Did Honour first, that barbarous term, devise, Unknown to all the gentler Savages; And, as 'twere not enough t'have fetch'd from Hell, Powder, and Guns, with all the arts to kill, Farther to plague the World, he must ingross Huge Codes, and bulky Pandects of the Laws, With Doctors Glosses to perplex the Cause, Where darken'd Equity is kept from light, Under vast Reams of non sense buried quite. Gently, good Sir! (cry you) why all this rant? Man has his freaks, and passions; that we grant: He has his frailties, and blind sides; who doubts? But his least Virtues balance all his Faults. Pray, was it not this bold, this thinking Man, That measur'd Heav'n, and taught the Stars to scan, Whose boundless wit, with soaring wings durst fly, Beyond the flaming borders of the sky; Turn'd Nature o're, and with a piercing view Each cranny search'd, and look'd her through and through: Which of the Brutes have Universities? When was it heard, that they e're took Degrees, Or were Professors of the Faculties? By Law, or Physick were they ever known To merit Velvet, or a Scarlet Gown? No questionless; nor did we ever read, Of Quacks with them, that were Licentiates made, By Patent to profess the poys'ning Trade: No Doctors in the Desk there hold dispute About Black-pudding, while the wond'ring Rout Listen to hear the knotty Truth made out: Nor Virtuoso's teach deep mysteries Of Arts for pumping Air, and smothering Flies. But not to urge the matter farther now, Nor search it to the depth, what 'tis to know, And whether we know any thing or no. Answer me only this, What man is there In this vile thankless Age, wherein we are, Who does by Sense and Learning value bear? Would'st thou get Honour, and a fair Estate, And have the looks and favours of the Great? Cries an old Father to his blooming Son, Take the right course, be rul'd by me, 'tis done. Leave mouldy Authors to the reading Fools, The poring crowds in Colleges and Schools: How much is threescore Nobles? Twenty pound. Well said; my Son, the Answer's most profound: Go, thou know'st all that's requisite to know; What Wealth on thee, what Honours haste to flow! In these high Sciences thy self employ, Instead of Plato, take thy Hodder, Boy. Learn there the art to audit an Account, To what the Kings Revenue does amount: How much the Customs, and Excise bring in, And what the Managers each year purloin. Get a Case-harden'd Conscience, Irish proof, Which nought of pity, sense, or shame can move: Turn Algerine, Barbarian, Turk, or Jew, Unjust, inhumane, treacherous, base, untrue; Ne'r stick at wrong; hang Widows sighs and tears, The cant of Priests to frighten Usurers: Boggle at nothing to encrease thy Store, Nor Orphans spoils, nor plunder of the Poor: And scorning paltry rules of Honesty, By surer methods raise thy Fortune high. Then shoals of Poets, Pedants, Orators, Doctors, Divines, Astrologers, and Lawyers, Authors of every sort, and every size, To thee their Works, and Labours shall address, With pompous Lines their Dedications fill, And learnedly in Greek and Latine tell Lies to thy face, that thou hast deep insight, And art a mighty Judg of what they write. He that is rich, is every thing, that is, Without one grain of Wisdom he is wise, And knowing nought, knows all the Sciences: He's witty, gallant, virtuous, generous, stout, Well-born, well-bred, well-shap'd, well-drest, what not? Lov'd by the Great, and courted by the Fair, For none that e're had Riches, found despair: Gold to the loathsom'st object gives a grace, And sets it off, and makes ev'n Bovey please: But tatter'd Poverty they all despise, Love stands aloof, and from the Scare-crow flies. Thus a stanch Miser to his hopeful Brat Chalks out the way that leads to an Estate; Whose knowledg oft with utmost stretch of Brain No high'r than this vast secret can attain, Five and four's nine, take two, and seven remain, Go, Doctor, after this, and rack your Brains, Unravel Scripture with industrious pains: On musty Fathers waste your fruitless hours, Correct the Criticks, and Expositors: Out-vie great Stilling fleet in some vast Tome, And there confound both Bellarmine and Rome; Or glean the Rabbies of their learned store, To find what Father Simon has past o're: Then at the last some bulky piece compile, There lay out all your time, and pains, and skill? And when 'tis done and finish'd for the Press, To some great name the mighty Work address: Who for a full reward of all your toil, Shall pay you with a gracious nod or smile: Just recompence of life too vainly spent! An empty Thank you Sir, and Complement. But, if to higher Honours you pretend, Take the advice and counsel of a Friend; Here quit the Desk, and throw your Scarlet by, And to some gainful course your self apply. Go, practise with some Banker how to cheat, There's choice in Town, enquire in Lombard street. Let Scot and Ockam wrangle as they please, And thus in short with me conclude the case, A Doctor is no better than an Ass. A Doctor, Sir? your self: Pray have a care, This is to push your Raillery too far. But not to lose the time in trifling thus, Beside the point, come now more home and close: That Man has Reason is beyond debate, Nor will your self, I think, deny me that: And was not this fair Pilot giv'n to steer, His tott'ring Bark through Life's rough Ocean here? All this I grant: But if in spite of it The Wretch on every Rock he sees will split, To what great purpose does his Reason serve, But to misguide his course, and make him swerve? What boots it H. when it says, Give o're Thy scribling itch, and play the fool no more. If her vain counsels, purpos'd to reclaim, Only avail to harden him in shame? Lampoon'd, and hiss'd, and damn'd the thousandth time, Still he writes on, is obstinate in Rhime: His Verse, which he does every where recite, Put all his Neighbors, and his Friends to flight: Scar'd by the rhiming Fiend, they hast away, Nor will his very Groom be hir'd to stay. The Ass, whom Nature Reason has deni'd, Content with Instinct for his surer guide, Still follows that, and wiselier does proceed: He ne'er aspires with his harsh braying Note, The Songsters of the Wood to challenge out: Nor like this awkard smatterer in Arts, Sets up himself for a vain Ass of parts; Of reason void, he sees, and gains his end, While Man, who does to that false light pretend, Wildly gropes on, and in broad day is blind. By whimsie led he does all things by chance, And acts in each against all-common sense. With every thing pleas'd, and displeas'd at once, He knows not what he seeks, nor what he shuns: Unable to distinguish good, or bad, For nothing he is gay, for nothing sad: At random loves, and loaths, avoids, pursues, Enacts, repeals, makes, alters, does, undoes. Did we, like him, e'er see the Dog, or Bear, Chimera's of their own devising fear? Frame needless doubts, and for those doubts forego The Joys which prompting Nature calls them to? And with their Pleasures awkardly at strife, With scaring Fantoms pall the sweets of Life? Tell me, grave Sir, did ever Man see Beast So much below himself, and sense debas'd, To worship Man with superstitious Fear, And fondly to his Idol Temples rear? Was he e'er seen with Pray'rs, and Sacrifice Approach to him, as Ruler of the Skies, To beg for Rain, or Sun-shine on his knees? No never: but a thousand times has Beast Seen Man, beneath the meanest Brute debas'd, Fall low to Wood, and Metal heretofore, And madly his own Workmanship adore: In Egypt oft has seen the Sot bow down, And reverence some deified Baboon: Has often seen him on the Banks of Nile Say Pray'rs to the Almighty Crocodile: And now each day in every street abroad Sees prostrate Fools adore a breaden God. But why (say you) these spiteful Instances Of Egypt, and its gross Idolatries? Of Rome, and hers as much ridiculous? What are these lewd Buffooneries to us? How gather you from such wild proofs as these, That Man, a Doctor is beneath an Ass? An Ass! that heavy, stupid, lumpish Beast, The Sport, and mocking-stock of all the rest? Whom they all spurn, and whom they all despise, Whose very name all Satyr does comprize? An Ass, Sir? Yes: Pray what should make us laugh? Now he unjustly is our jeer, and scoff. But, if one day he should occasion find Upon our Follies to express his mind; If Heav'n, as once of old, to check proud Man, By miracle should give him Speech again; What would he say, d'ye think, could he speak out, Nay, Sir, betwixt us two, what would he not? What would he say, were he condemn'd to stand For one long hour in Fleetstreet, or the Strand, To cast his eyes upon the motly throng, The two-leg'd Herd, that daily pass along; To see their odd Disguises, Furs, and Gowns, Their Cassocks, Cloaks; Lawn-sleeves, and Pantaloons? What would he say to see a Velvet Quack Walk with the price of forty kill'd on's Back; Or mounted on a Stage, and gaping loud, Commend his Drugs, and Ratsbane to the Crowd? What would he think, on a Lord Mayor's day, Should he the Pomp and Pageantry survey? Or view the Judges, and their solemn Train, March with grave decency to kill a Man? What would he think of us, should he appear In Term amongst the Crowds at Westminster, And there the hellish din, and Jargon hear, Where S. and his Pack with deep mouth'd Notes Drown Billingsgate, and all its Oyster-Boats? There see the Judges, Sergeants, Barristers, Attorneys, Counsellors, Solicitors, Criers, and Clerks, and all the Savage Crew Which wretched man at his own charge undo? If after prospect of all this, the Ass Should find the voice he had in Esop's days; Then, Doctor, then, casting his eyes around On human Fools, which every where abound. Content with Thistles, from all envy free, And shaking his grave head, no doubt he'd cry Good faith, Man is a Beast as much as we. THE THIRTEENTH SATYR OF JUVENAL, Imitated. Written in April, 1682. ARGUMENT. The POET comforts a Friend, that is overmuch concerned for the loss of a considerable Sum of Money, of which he has lately been cheated by a person, to whom he intrusted the same. This he does by shewing, that nothing comes to pass in the world without Divine Providence, and that wicked Men (however they seem to escape its Punishment here) yet suffer abundantly in the torments of an evil Conscience. And by the way takes occasion to lash the Degeneracy, and Villany of the present Times. There is not one base Act, which men commit, But carries this ill sting along with it, That to the Author it creates regret: And this is some Revenge at least, that he Can ne'er acquit himself of Villany. Tho a Brib'd Judg and Jury set him free. All people, Sir, abhor (as 'tis but just) Your faithless Friend, wo lately broke his Trust, And curse the treacherous Deed: But, thanks to Fate, That has not bless'd you with so small Estate, But that with patience you may bear the Cross, And need not sink under so mean a Loss. Besides your Case for less concern does call, Because 'tis what does usually befall: Ten thousand such might be alledg'd with ease, Out of the common crowd of Instances. Then cease for shame, immoderate regret, And don't your Manhood, and your sense forget: 'Tis womanish, and silly to lay forth More cost in Grief than a Misfortune's worth, You scarce can bear a puny trifling ill, It goes so deep; pray Heav'n! it does not kill: And all this trouble, and this vain ado, Because a Friend (forsooth) has prov'd untrue. Shame o' your Beard! can this so much amaze? Were you not born in good King Jemmy's days? And are not you at length yet wiser grown, When threescore Winters on your head have snown; Almighty Wisdom gives in Holy Writ Wholsom Advise to all, that follow it: And those, that will not its great Counsels hear, May learn from meer experience how to bear (Without vain strugling) Fortune's yoke, and how They ought her rudest shocks to undergo, There's not a day so solemn through the year, Not one red Letter in the Calendar, But we of some new Crime discover'd hear. Theft, Murder, Treason, Perjury, what not? Moneys by Cheating, Padding, Poisoning got. Nor is it strange; so few are now the Good, That fewer scarce were left at Noah's Flood: Should Sodom's Angel here in Fire descend, Our Nation wants ten Men to save the Land, Fate has reserv'd us for the very Lees Of Time, where Ill admits of no degrees: An Age so bad old Poets ne'r could frame, Nor find a Metal out to give't a name. This your Experience knows; and yet for all On faith of God, and Man aloud you call, Louder than on Queen Bess's day the Rout For Antichrist burnt in Effigie shout: But, tell me, Sir, tell me, grey-headed Boy, Do you not know what Lech'ry men enjoy In stollen Goods? For Gods sake don't you see How they all laugh at your simplicity, When gravely you forewarn of Perjury? Preach up a God, and Hell, vain empty names, Exploded now for idle thredbare shams, Devis'd by Priests, and by none else believ'd, E'er since great Hobbs the World has undeceiv'd? This might have past with the plain simple Race Of our Forefathers in King Arthur's days: E're, mingling with corrupted forein Seed, We learn'd their Vice, and spoil'd our native Breed. E're yet bless'd Albion, high in ancient Fame, With her first Innocence resign'd her Name. Fair dealing then, and downright Honesty, And plighted Faith were good Security: No vast Ingrossments for Estates were made, Nor Deeds, large as the Lands, which they convey'd: To bind a Trust there lack'd no formal ties Of Paper, Wax, and Seals, and Witnesses, Nor ready Coin, but sterling Promises: Each took the other's word, and that would go For currant then, and more than Oaths do now: None had recourse to Chanc'ry for defence, Where you forego your Right with less Expence: Nor traps were yet set up for Perjurers, That catch men by the Heads, and whip off Ears. Then Knave, and Villain, things unheard of were, Scarce in a Century did one appear, And he more gaz'd at than a Blazing-Star: If a young Stripling put not off his Hat In high respect to every Beard he met, Tho a Lord's Son, and Heir, 'twas held a crime, That scarce deserv'd its Clergy in that time: So venerable then was four years odds, And grey old Heads were reverenc'd as Gods. Now if a Friend once in an Age prove just, If he miraculously keep his Trust, And without force of Law deliver all That's due, both Interest, and Principal; Prodigious wonder! fit for Stow to tell, And stand recorded in the Chronicle; A thing less memorable would require As great a Monument as London Fire. A man of Faith and Uprightness is grown So strange a Creature both in Court and Town, That he with Elephants may well be shewn. A Monster, more uncommon than a Whale At Bridge, the last great Comet, or the Hail, Than Thames his double Tide, or should he run With Streams of Milk, or Bloud to Gravesend down. You're troubled that you've lost five hundred pound By treacherous Fraud: another may be found, Has lost a thousand: and another yet, Double to that; perhaps his whole Estate. Little do folks the heav'nly Powers mind, If they but scape the knowledge of Mankind: Observe, with how demure, and grave a look The Rascal lays his hand upon the Book: Then with a praying Face, and lifted Eye Claps on his Lips, and Seals the Perjury: If you persist his Innocence to doubt, And boggle in Belief; he'l strait rap out Oaths by the volley, each of which would make Pale Atheists start, and trembling Bullies quake; And more than would a whole Ships Crew maintain To the East-Indies hence, and back again. As God shall pardon me, Sir, I am free Of what you charge me with: let me ne'r see His Face in Heaven else: may these hands rot, These eyes drop out; if I e'er had a Groat Of yours, or if they ever touch'd, or saw't. Thus he'l run on two hours in length, till he Spin out a curse long as the Litany: Till Heav'n has scarce a Judgment left in store For him to wish, deserve, or suffer more. These are, who disavow all Providence, And think the world is only steer'd by chance: Make God at best an idle looker on, A lazy Monarch lolling in his Throne: Who his Affairs does neither mind, or know, And leaves them all at random here below: And such as every foot themselves will damn, And Oaths no more than common Breath esteem: No shame, nor loss of Ears can frighten these, Were every Street a Grove of Pillories. Others there be, that own a God, and fear His Vengeance to ensue, and yet forswear: Thus to himself, says one, Let Heaven decree What Doom soe're, its pleasure will, of me: Strike me with Blindness, Palsies, Leprosies, Plague, Pox, Consumption, all the Maladies Of both the Spittles; so I get my Prize, And hold it sure; I'll suffer these, and more; All Plagues are light to that of being poor. There's not a begging Cripple in the streets (Unless he with his Limbs has lost his Wits, And is grown fit for Bedlam) but no doubt, To have his Wealth would have the Rich man's Gout. Grant Heavens Vengeance heavy be; what tho? The heaviest things move slowliest still we know: And, if it punish all, that guilty be, 'Twill be an Age before it come to me: God too is merciful, as well as just; Therefore I'll rather his forgiveness trust, Than live despis'd, and poor, as thus I must: I'll try, and hope, he's more a Gentleman Than for such trivial things as these, to damn. Besides, for the same Fact we've often known One mount the Cart, another mount the Throne: And foulest Deeds, attended with success, No longer are reputed wickedness, Disguis'd with Virtues Livery, and Dress. With these weak Arguments they fortifie, And harden up themselves in Villany: The Rascal now dares call you to account, And in what Court you please, joyn issue on't: Next Term he'l bring the Action to be tri'd, And twenty Witnesses to swear on's side: And, if that Justice to his Cause be found, Expects a Verdict of five hundred pound. Thus he, who boldly dares the Guilt out-face, For innocent shall with the Rabble pass: While you, with Impudence, and sham run down, Are only thought the Knave by all the Town. Mean time, poor you at Heav'n exclaim, and rail, Louder than I—at the Bar does Bawl: Is there a Pow'r above? and does he hear? And can he tamely Thunderbolts forbear? To what vain end do we with Pray'rs adore? And on our bended knees his aid implore? Where is his Rule, if no respect be had, Of Innocence, or Guilt, of Good, or Bad? And who henceforth will any credit show To what his lying Priests teach here below? If this be Providence; for ought I see, Bless'd Saint, Vaninus! I shall follow thee: Little's the odds 'twixt such a God, and that, Which Atheist Lewis us'd to wear in's Hat. Thus you blaspheme, and rave: But pray, Sir, try What Comforts my weak Reason can apply, Who never yet read Plutarch, hardly saw, And am but meanly vers'd in Seneca. In cases dangerous and hard of cure We have recourse to Scarborough, or Lower: But if they don't so desperate appear, We trust to meaner Doctors skill, and care. If there were never in the world before So foul a deed; I'm dumb, not one word more: A God's name then let both your sluces flow, And all th' extravagance of sorrow show; And tear your Hair, and thump your mournful Breast, As if your dearest First-born were deceas'd. 'Tis granted that a greater Grief attends Departed Moneys than departed Friends: None ever counterfeits upon this score, Nor need he do't: the thought of being poor Will serve alone to make the eyes run o're. Lost Money's griev'd with true unfeigned Tears, More true, than Sorrrow of expecting Heirs At their dead Father's Funerals, tho here The Back, and Hands no pompous Mourning wear. But if the like Complaints be daily found At Westminster, and in all Courts abound; If Bonds, and Obligations can't prevail, But men deny their very Hand and Seal, Sign'd with the Arms of the whole Pedigree Of their dead Ancestors to vouch the Lye, If Temple-Walks, and Smithfield never fail Of plying Rogues, that set their Souls to sale To the first Passenger, that bids a price, And make their livelihood of Perjuries; For God's sake why are you so delicate, And think it hard to share the common Fate? And why must you alone be Fav'rite thought Of Heav'n, and we for Reprobates cast out? The wrong you bear, is hardly worth regard, Much less your just resentment, if compar'd With greater out-rages to others done, Which daily happen, and alarm the Town: Compare the Villains who cut Throats for Bread, Or Houses fire, of late a gainful Trade, By which our City was in Ashes laid: Compare the sacrilegious Burglary, From which no place can Sanctuary be, That rifles Churches of Communion-Plate, Which good King Edward's days did dedicate: Think, who durst steal S. Alban's Font of Brass, That Christen'd half the Royal Scotish Race: Who stole the Chalices at Chichester, In which themselves receiv'd the day before: Or that bold daring hand, of fresh Renown, Who, scorning common Booty, stole a Crown: Compare too, if you please, the horrid Plot, With all the Perjuries to make it out, Or make it nothing, for these last three years; Add to it Thinne's and Godfrey's Murderers: And if these seem but slight, and trivial things, Add those, that have, and would have murder'd Kings. And yet how little's this of Villany To what our Judges oft in one day try? This to convince you, do but travel down, When the next Circuit comes, with Pemberton, Or any of the Twelve, and there but mind, How many Rogues there are of Humane kind, And let me hear you, when you're back again, Say, you are wrong'd, and, if you dare, complain. None wonder, who in Essex Hundreds live, Or Sheppy Island, to have Agues rife: Nor would you think it much in Africa, If you great Lips, and short flat Noses saw: Because 'tis so by Nature of each place; And therefore there for no strange things they pass. In Lands, where Pigmies are, to see a Crane (As Kites do Chickens here) sweep up a Man, In Armour clad, with us would make a show, And serve for entertain at Bartholmew: Yet there it goes for no great Prodigy, Where the whole Nation is but one foot high: Then why, fond Man, should you so much admire, Since Knave is of our Growth, and common here? But must such Perjury escape (say you) And shall it ever thus unpunish'd go? Grant, he were dragg'd to Jail this very hour, To starve, and rot; suppose it in your Pow'r To rack, and torture him all kind of ways, To hang, or burn, or kill him, as you please; (And what would your Revenge it self have more?) Yet this, all this would not your Cash restore: And where would be the Comfort, where the Good, If you could wash your Hands in's reaking Bloud? But, Oh, Revenge more sweet than Life! 'Tis true, So the unthinking say, and the mad Crew Of hect'ring Blades, who for slight cause, or none, At every turn are into Passion blown: Whom the least Trifles with Revenge inspire, And at each spark, like Gun-powder, take fire: These unprovok'd kill the next Man they meet, For being so sawcy, as to walk the Street; And at the summons of each tiny Drab, Cry, Damme! Satisfaction! draw, and Stab. Not so of old, the mild good Socrates, (Who shew'd how high without the help of Grace, Well-cultivated Nature might be wrought) He a more noble way of suff'ring taught, And, tho he Guiltless drank the poisonous Dose, Ne'er wish'd a drop to his accusing Foes. Not so our great good Martyr'd King of late (Could we his bless'd Example imitate) Who, tho the great'st of mortal sufferers, Yet kind to his rebellious Murderers, Forgave, and bless'd them with his dying Pray'rs. Thus, we by sound Divinity, and Sense May purge our minds, and weed all Errors thence: These lead us into right, nor shall we need Other than them through Life to be our Guide. Revenge is but a Frailty, incident To craz'd, and sickly minds, the poor Content Of little Souls, unable to surmount An Injury, too weak to bear Affront: And this you may infer, because we find, 'Tis most in poor unthinking Woman-kind, Who wreak their feeble spite on all they can, And are more kin to Brute than braver Man. But why should you imagine, Sir, that those Escape unpunish'd, who still feel the Throes And Pangs of a rack'd Soul, and (which is worse Than all the Pains, which can the Body curse) The secret gnawings of unseen Remorse? Believe't, they suffer greater Punishment Than Rome's Inquisitor's could e're invent: Not all the Tortures, Racks, and Cruelties, Which ancient Persecutors could devise, Nor all, that Fox his Bloudy Records tell, Can match what Bradshaws, and Ravilliacs feel, Who in their Breasts carry about their Hell. I've read this story, but I know nor where, Whether in Hackwel, or Beard's Theatre: A certain Spartan, whom a Friend, like you, Had trusted with a Hundred pound or two, Went to the Oracle to know if he With safety might the Sum in trust deny. 'Twas answer'd, No, that if he durst forswear, He should e're long for's knavery pay dear: Hence Fear, not Honesty, made him refund; Yet to his cost the Sentence true he found: Himself, his Children, all his Family, Ev'n the remotest of his whole Pedigree, Perish'd (as there 'tis told) in misery. Now to apply: if such be the sad end Of Perjury, tho but in Thought design'd, Think, Sir, what Fate awaits your treach'rous Friend, Who has not only thought, but done to you All this, and more; think, what he suffers now, And think, what every Villain suffers else, That dares, like him, be faithless, base, and false. Pale Horror, ghastly Fear, and black Despair Pursue his steps, and dog him wheresoe're He goes, and if from his loath'd self he fly, To Herd, like wounded Deer, in company, These strait creep in and pale his mirth, and joy. The choicest Dainties, ev'n by Lumly drest, Afford no Relish to his sickly Taste, Insipid all, as Damocles his Feast. Ev'n Wine, the greatest Blessing of Mankind, The best support of the dejected mind, Applied to his dull spirits, warms no more Than to his Corps it could past Life restore. Darkness he fears, nor dares he trust his Bed Without a Candle watching by his side: And, if the wakeful Troubles of his Breast To his toss'd Limbs allow one moments Rest, Straitways the groans of Ghosts, and hideous Screams Of tortur'd Spirits haunt his frightful Dreams: Strait there return to his tormented mind His perjur'd Act, his injur'd God, and Friend: Strait he imagines you before his Eyes, Ghastly of shape, prodigious of size. With glaring Eyes, cleft Foot, and monstrous Tail, And bigger than the Giants at Guild-hall, Stalking with horrid strides across the Room, And guards of Fiends to drag him to his Doom: Hereat he falls in dreadful Agonies, And dead cold Sweats his trembling Members seize: Then starting wakes, and with a dismal cry, Calls to his aid his frighted Family; There owns the Crime, and vows upon his knees The sacred Pledge next morning to release. These are the men, whom the least Terrors daunt, Who at the sight of their own shadows faint; These, if it chance to Lighten, are agast, And quake for fear, lest every Flash should blast: These swoon away at the first Thunder-clap, As if 'twere not, what usually does hap, The casual cracking of a Cloud, but sent By Angry Heaven for their Punishment: And, if unhurt they 'scape the Tempest now, Still dread the greater Vengeance to ensue: These the least Symptoms of a Fever fright, Water high-colour'd, want of rest at night, Or a disorder'd Pulse strait makes them shrink, And presently for fear they're ready sink Into their Graves: their time (think they) is come, And Heav'n in judgment now has sent their Doom. Nor dare they, though in whisper, waft a Prayer, Lest it by chance should reach th' Almighty's ear, And wake his sleeping Vengeance, which before So long has their impieties forbore. These are the thoughts which guilty Wretches haunt, Yet enter'd, they still grow more impudent: After a Crime perhaps they now and then Feel pangs and strugglings of Remorse within, But strait return to their old course agen: They, who have once thrown Shame, and Conscience by, Ne'er after make a stop in Villany: Hurried along, down the vast steep they go, And find, 'tis all a Precipice below. Ev'n this perfidious Friend of yours, no doubt Will not with single wickedness give out; Have patience but a while, you'l shortly see His hand held up at Bar for Felony: You'l see the sentenc'd wretch for Punishment To Scilly Isles, or the Caribbes sent; Or (if I may his surer Fate divine) Hung like Boroski, for a Gibbet-Sign: Then may you glut Revenge, and feast your Eyes With the dear object of his Miseries: And then at length convinc'd, with joy you'l find That the just God is neither deaf, nor blind. DAVID'S LAMENTATION For the Death of SAUL and JONATHAN, PARAPHRAS'D. ODE. Written in September, 1677. I. Ah wretched Israel! once a bless'd, and happy State, The Darling of the Stars, and Heavens Care, Then all the bord'ring world thy Vassals were, And thou at once their Envy and their Fear, How soon art thou (alas!) by the sad turn of Fate Become abandon'd and forlorn? How art thou now become their Pity, and their scorn? Thy Lustre all is vanish'd, all thy Glory fled, Thy Sun himself set in a bloud red, Too sure Prognostick! which does ill portend Approaching Storms on thy unhappy Land, Left naked, and defenceless now to each invading Hand. A fatal Battel, lately fought, Has all these Mis'ries, and Misfortunes brought, Has thy quick Ruine, and Destruction wrought: There fell we by a mighty Overthrow A Prey to an enrag'd, relentless Foe, The toil and labour of their wearied Cruelty, Till they no more could kill, and we no longer die: Vast slaughter all around th' enlarged Mountain swells, And numerous Deaths increase its former Hills. II. In Gath let not the mournful News be known, Nor publish'd in the streets of Askalon; May Fame it self be quite struck dumb! Oh may it never to Philistia come, Nor any live to bear the cursed Tidings home! Lest the proud Enemies new Trophies raise, And loudly triumph in our fresh Disgrace: No captive Israelite their pompous Joy adorn, Nor in sad Bondage his lost Country mourn: No Spoils of ours be in their Temples hung, No Hymns to Ashdod's Idol sung, Nor thankful Sacrifice on his glad Altars burn, Kind Heav'n forbid! lest the base Heathen Slaves blaspheme Thy sacred and unutterable Name, And above thine extol their Dagon's Fame. Lest the vile Fish's Worship spread abroad, Who fell a prostrate-Victim once before our conqu'ring God: And you, who the great Deeds of Kings and Kingdoms write, Who all their Actions to succeeding Age transmit, Conceal the blushing Story, ah! conceal Our Nations loss, and our dread Monarch's fall: Conceal the Journal of this bloudy Day, When both by the ill Play of Fate were thrown away: Nor let our wretched Infamy, and Fortune's Crime Be ever mention'd in the Registers of future Time. III. For ever, Gilboa, be curs'd thy hated Name, Th' eternal Monument of our Disgrace, and shame! For ever curss'd be that unhappy Scene, Where Slaughter, Bloud, and Death did lately reign! No Clouds henceforth above thy barren top appear. But what may make thee mourning wear: Let them ne're shake their dewy Fleeces there, But only once a year On the sad Anniverse drop a remembring Tear: No Flocks of Off'rings on thy Hills be known, Which may by Sacrifice our Guilt and thine attone No Sheep, nor any of the gentler kind hereafter stay On thee, but Bears, and Wolves, and Beasts of prey, Or men more savage, wild, and fierce than they; A Desart may'st thou prove, and lonely wast, Like that, our sinful, stubborn Fathers past, Where they the Penance trod for all, they there transgress'd: Too dearly wast thou drench'd with precious Bloud Of many a Jewish Worthy, spilt of late, Who suffer'd there by an ignoble Fate, And purchas'd foul Dishonour at too high a rate: Great Saul's ran there amongst the common Flood, His Royal self mixt with the baser Crowd: He, whom Heav'ns high and open suffrage chose, The Bulwark of our Nation to oppose The Pow'r and Malice of our Foes; Ev'n He, on whom the Sacred Oyl was shed, Whose mystick drops enlarg'd his hallow'd Head, Lies now (oh Fate, impartial still to Kings!) Huddled, and undistinguish'd in the heap of meaner Things. IV. Lo! there the mighty Warriour lies, With all his Lawrels, all his Victories, To ravenous Fowls, or worse, to his proud Foes, a Prize: How chang'd from that great Saul! whose generous Aid, A conqu'ring Army to distressed Jabesh led, At whose approach Ammon's proud Tyrant fled: How chang'd from that great Saul! whom we saw bring From vanquish'd Amalek their captive Spoils, and King; When unbid Pity made him Agag spare; Ah Pity! more can Cruelty found guilty there: Oft has he made these conquer'd Enemies bow, By whom himself lies conquer'd now: At Micmash his great-Might they felt, and knew, The same they felt at Dammin too: Well I remember, when from Helah's Plain He came in triumph, met by a numerous Crowd, Who with glad shouts proclaim'd their Joy aloud; A dance of beauteous Virgins led the solemn Train, And sung, and prais'd the man that had his thousands slain. Seir, Moab, Zobah felt him, and where e'er He did his glorious Standards bear, Officious Vict'ry follow'd in the rere: Success attended still his brandish'd Sword, And, like the Grave, the gluttonous Blade devour'd: Slaughter upon its point in triumph sate, And scatter'd Death, as quick, and wide as Fate. V. Nor less in high Repute, and Worth was his great Son, Sole Heir of all his Valour, and Renown, Heir too (if cruel Fate had suffer'd) of his Throne: The matchless Jonathan 'twas, whom loud tongu'd Fame Amongst her chiefest Heroes joys to name, E're since the wond'rous Deeds of Seneh done, Where he, himself an Host, o'recame a War alone: The trembling Enemies fled, they try'd to fly, But fix'd amazement stopt, and made them die. Great Archer he! to whom our dreadful skill me owe, Dreaded by all, who Israel's warlike Prowess know; As many Shafts, as his full Quiver held, So many Fates he drew, so many kill'd: Quick, and unerring they, as darted Eye-beams, flew, As if he gave 'em sight, and swiftness too. Death took her Aim from his, and by't her Arrows threw. VI. Both excellent they were, both equally alli'd On Nature, and on Valour's side: Great Saul, who scorn'd a Rival in Renown, Yet envied not the Fame of's greater Son, By him endur'd to be surpass'd alone: He gallant Prince, did his whole Father shew, And fast, as he could set, the well-writ Copies drew And blush'd, that Duty bid him not out-go: Together they did both the paths to Glory trace, Together hunted in the noble Chace, Together finish'd their united Race: There only did they prove unfortunate, Never till then unbless'd by Fate, Yet there they ceas'd not to be great; Fearless they met, and brav'd their threaten'd fall, And fought when Heav'n revolted, Fortune durst rebel. When publick safety, and their Countries care Requir'd their Aid, and call'd them to the toils of War; As Parent-Eagles, summon'd by their Infants cries Whom some rude hands would make a Prize, Haste to Relief, and with their Wings out-fly their eyes; So swift did they their speedy succour bear, So swift the bold Aggressors seize, So swift attack, so swift pursue the vanquish'd enemies: The vanquish'd enemies with all the wings of Fear Mov'd not so quick as they, Scarce could their souls fly fast enough away. Bolder than Lions, they thick Dangers met, Through Fields with armed Troops, and pointed Harvests set, Nothing could tame their Rage, or quench their Generous Heat: Like those, they march'd undaunted, and like those, Secure of Wounds, and all that durst oppose, So to Resisters fierce, so gentle to their prostrate Foes. VII. Mourn, wretched Israel, mourn thy Monarch's fall, And all thy plenteous stock of sorrow call, T'attend his pompous Funeral: Mourn each, who in this loss an int'rest shares, Lavish your Grief, exhaust it all in Tears: You Hebrew Virgins too, Who once in lofty strains did his glad Triumphs sing, Bring all your Artful Notes, and skilful Measures now, Each charming air of Breath and string, Bring all to grace the Obsequies of your dead King, And high, as then your Joy, let now your Sorrow flow. Saul, your great Saul is dead, Who you with Natures choicest Dainties fed, Who you with Natures gayest Wardrobe clad, By whom you all her Pride, and all her Pleasures had: For you the precious Worm his Bowels spun, For you the Tyrian Fish did Purple run, For you the bless'd Arabia's Spices grew, And Eastern Quarries harden'd Pearly dew; The Sun himself turn'd Labourer for you: For you he hatch'd his golden Births alone, Wherewith you were array'ed, whereby you him out-shone. All this and more you did to Saul's great Conduct owe, All this you lost in his unhappy overthrow. VIII. Oh Death! how vast an Harvest hast thou reap'd of late! Never before hadst thou so great, Ne'er drunk'st before so deep of Jewish Bloud, Ne're since th' embattled Hosts at Gibeah stood; When three whole days took up the work of Fate, When a large Tribe enter'd at once thy Bill, Ane threescore thousand Victims to thy Fury fell. Upon the fatal Mountains Head, Lo! how the mighty Chiefs lie dead: There my beloved Jonathan was slain, The best of Princes, and the best of Men; Cold Death hangs on his Cheeks like an untimely Frost On early Fruit, there sits, and smiles a sullen Boast, And yet looks pale at the great Captive, she has ta'en. My Jonathan is dead! (oh dreadful'st word of Fame! Oh grief! that I can speak't, and not become the same!) He's dead, and with him all our blooming Hopes are gone, And many a wonder, which he must have done, And many a Conquest which he must have won. They're all to the dark Grave, and Silence fled And never now in story shall be read, And never now shall take their date, Snatch'd hence by the preventing hand of envious Fate. IX. Ah worthy Prince! would I for thee had died! Ah, would I had thy fatal place supplied! I'd then repaid a Life, which to thy gift I owe, Repaid a Crown, which Friendship taught thee to forgo; Both Debts, I ne'er can cancel now: Oh, dearer than my Soul! if I can call it mine, For sure we had the same, 'twas very thine, Dearer than Light, or Life, or Fame, Or Crowns, or any thing, that I can wish, or think, or name: Brother thou wast, but wast my Friend before, And that new Title then could add no more: Mine more than Bloud, Alliance, Natures self could make, Than I, or Fame it self can speak: Not yearning Mothers, when first Throes they feel To their young Babes in looks a softer Passion tell: Nor artless undissembling Maids express In their last dying sighs such Tenderness: Not thy fair Sister, whom strict Duty bids me wear First in my Brest, whom holy Vows make mine, Tho all the Virtues of a loyal Wife she bare, Could boast an Union so near, Could boast a Love so firm, so lasting, so Divine. So pure is that which we in Angels find To Mortals here, in Heav'n to their own kind: So pure, but not more great must that blest Friendship prove (Could, ah, could I to that wish'd Place, and Thee remove) Which shall for ever joyn our mingled Souls above, X. Ah wretched Israel! ah unhappy state! Expos'd to all the Bolts of angry Fate! Expos'd to all thy Enemies revengeful hate! Who is there left their fury to withstand? What Champions now to guard thy helpless Land? Who is there left in listed Fields to head Thy valiant Youth, and lead them on to Victory? Alas! thy valiant Youth are dead, And all thy brave Commanders too: Lo! how the Glut, and Riot of the Grave they lie, And none survive the fatal Overthrow, To right their injur'd Ghosts upon the barbarous Foe! Rest, ye bless'd shades, in everlasting Peace, Who fell your Country's bloudy Sacrifice: For ever Sacred be your Memories, And may e're long some dread Avenger rise To wipe of Heav'ns and your Disgrace: May then these proud insulting Foes Wash off our stains of Honour with their Bloud. May they ten thousand fold repay our loss. For every Life a Myriad, every Drop a Floud. THE ODE OF Aristotle in Athenæus, PARAPHRAS'D. I. Honour! thou greatest Blessing in the gift of Heaven, Which only art to its chief Darlings given: Cheaply with Bloud and Dangers art thou sought, Nor canst at any rate be over-bought. Thou, shining Honour, are the noblest chase Of all the braver part of Humane Race: Thou only art worth living for below, And only worth our dying too. For thee, bright Goddess, for thy charming sake, Does Greece such wond'rous Actions undertake; For thee no Toils, nor Hardships she forgoes, And Death amidst ten thousand ghastly Terrors wooes. So powerfully dost thou the mind inspire, And kindlest there so generous a fire, As makes thy zealous Votaries All things, but Thee despise; Makes them the love of Thee prefer Before th' enchantments of bewitching Gold, Before th' embraces of a Parent's arms, Before soft ease, and Love's enticing Charms, And all, that Men on Earth most valuable hold. II. For Thee the Heav'n-born Hercules And Leda's faithful Twins, in Birth no less, So many mighty Labours underwent, And by their God-like Deeds proclaim'd their high Descent. By thee they reach'd the bless'd Abode, The worthy Prize, for which in Glory's path they trode. By thee great Ajax, and the greater Son Of Peleus were exalted to Renown: Envied by the Immortals did they go, Laden with triumph to the shades below. For thee, and thy dear sake Did the young Worthy of Atarna lately stake His Life in Battel to the chance of Fate, And bravely lost, what he so boldly set: Yet lost he not his glorious aim, But by short Death purchas'd eternal Fame: The grateful Muses shall embalm his Memory, And never let it die: They shall his great Exploits rehearse, And consecrate the Hero in immortal Verse. Upon the Works of BEN. JOHNSON. ODE. Written in 1678. I. Great Thou! whom 'tis a Crime almost to dare to praise, Whose firm establish'd, and unshaken Glories stand, And proudly their own Fame command, Above our pow'r to lessen or to raise, And all, but the few Heirs of thy brave Genius, and thy Bays; Hail mighty Founder of our Stage! for so I dare Entitle thee, nor any modern Censures fear, Nor care what thy unjust Detractors say; They'l say perhaps, that others did Materials bring, That others did the first Foundations lay, And glorious 'twas (we grant) but to begin, But thou alone couldst finish the design, All the fair Model, and the Workmanship was thine: Some bold Advent'rers might have been before, Who durst the unknown world explore, By them it was survey'd at distant view, And here and there a Cape, and Line they drew, Which only serv'd as hints, and marks to thee, Who wast reserv'd to make the full Discovery: Art's Compass to thy painful search we owe, Whereby thou went'st so far, and we may after go, By that we may Wit's vast, and trackless Ocean try, Content no longer, as before, Dully to coast along the shore, But steer a course more unconfin'd, and free, Beyond the narrow bounds, that pent Antiquity. II. Never till thee the Theater possess'd A Prince with equal Pow'r, and Greatness bless'd, No Government, or Laws it had To strengthen, and establish it, Till thy great hand the Scepter sway'd, But groan'd under a wretched Anarchy of Wit: Unform'd, and void was then its Poesie, Only some pre-existing Matter we Perhaps could see, That might foretel what was to be; A rude, and undigested Lump it lay, Like the old Chaos, e're the birth of Light, and Day, Till thy brave Genius like a new Creator came, And undertook the mighty Frame: No shuffled Atoms did the well-built work compose, It from no lucky hit of blund'ring Chance arose (As some of this great Fabrick idly dream) But wise, all-seeing Judgment did contrive, And knowing Art its Graces give: No sooner did thy Soul with active Force and Fire The dull and heavy Mass inspire, But strait throughout it let us see Proportion, Order, Harmony, And every part did to the whole agree, And strait appear'd a beauteous new-made world of Poetry. III. Let dull, and ignorant Pretenders Art condemn (Those only Foes to Art, and Art to them) The meer Fanaticks, and Enthusiasts in Poetry (For Schismaticks in that, as in Religion be) Who make't all Revelation, Trance, and Dream, Let them despise her Laws, and think That Rules and Forms the Spirit stint: Thine was no mad, unruly Frenzy of the brain, Which justly might deserve the Chain, 'Twas brisk, and mettled, but a manag'd Rage, Sprightly as vig'rous Youth, and cool as temp'rate Age: Free, like thy Will, it did all Force disdain, But suffer'd Reason's loose, and easie rein, By that it suffer'd to be led, Which did not curb Poetick liberty, but guide: Fancy, that wild and haggard Faculty, Untam'd in most, and let at random fly, Was wisely govern'd, and reclaim'd by thee, Restraint, and Discipline was made endure, And by thy calm, and milder Judgment brought to lure; Yet when 'twas at some nobler Quarry sent, With bold, and tow'ring wings it upward went, Not lessen'd at the greatest height, Not turn'd by the most giddy flights of dazling Wit. IV. Nature, and Art together met, and joyn'd, Made up the Character of thy great Mind. That like a bright and glorious Sphere, Appear'd with numerous Stars embellish'd o're, And much of Light to thee, and much of Influence bore, This was the strong Intelligence, whose pow'r Turn'd it about, and did th' unerring motions steer: Concurring both like vital Seed, and Heat, The noble Births they joyntly did beget, And hard 'twas to be thought, Which most of force to the great Generation brought: So mingling Elements compose our Bodies frame, Fire, Water, Earth, and Air Alike their just Proportions share, Each undistinguish'd still remains the same, Yet can't we say that either's here, or there, But all, we know not how, are scatter'd every where. V. Sober, and grave was still the Garb thy Muse put on, No tawdry careless slattern Dress, Nor starch'd, and formal with Affectedness, Nor the cast Mode, and Fashion of the Court, and Town; But neat, agreeable, and janty 'twas, Well-fitted, it sate close in every place, And all became with an uncommon Air, and Grace: Rich, costly and substantial was the stuff, Not barely smooth, nor yet too coarsly rough: No refuse, ill-patch'd Shreds o'th' Schools, The motly wear of read, and learned Fools, No French Commodity which now so much does take, And our own better Manufacture spoil, Nor was it ought of forein Soil; But Staple all, and all of English Growth, and Make: What Flow'rs soe're of Art it had, were found No tinsel'd slight Embroideries. But all appear'd either the native Ground, Or twisted, wrought, and interwoven with the Piece. VI. Plain Humour, shewn with her whole various Face, Not mask'd with any antick Dress, Nor screw'd in forc'd, ridiculous Grimace (The gaping Rabbles dull delight, And more the Actor's than the Poet's Wit) Such did she enter on thy Stage, And such was represented to the wond'ring Age: Well wast thou skill'd, and read in humane kind, In every wild fantastick Passion of his mind, Didst into all his hidden Inclinations dive, What each from Nature does receive, Or Age, or Sex, or Quality, or Country give; What Custom too, that mighty Sorceress, Whose pow'rful Witchcraft does transform Enchanted Man to several monstrous Images, Makes this an odd, and freakish Monky turn, And that a grave and solemn Ass Appear, And all a thousand beastly shapes of Folly wear: Whate're Caprice or Whimsie leads awry Perverted, and seduc'd Mortality, Or does incline, and byass it From what's Discreet, and Wise, and Right, and Good, and Fit; All in thy faithful Glass were so express'd, As if they were Reflections of thy Breast, As if they had been stamp'd on thy own mind, And thou the universal vast Idea of Mankind. VII. Never didst thou with the same Dish repeated cloy. Tho every Dish, well-cook'd by thee, Contain'd a plentiful Variety To all that could sound relishing Palates be, Each Regale with new Delicacies did invite, Courted the Taste, and rais'd the Appetite: Whate're fresh dainty Fops in season were To garnish, and set out thy Bill of fare (Those never found to fail throughout the year, For seldom that ill-natur'd Planet rules, That plagues a Poet with a dearth of Fools) What thy strict Observation e're survey'd, From the fine, luscious Spark of high, and courtly Breed. Down to the dull, insipid Cit, Made thy pleas'd Audience entertainment fit, Serv'd up with all the grateful Poignances of Wit. VIII. Most Plays are writ like Almanacks of late, And serve one only year, one only State; Another makes them useless, stale, and out of date; But thine were wisely calculated fit For each Meridian, every Clime of Wit, For all succeeding time, and after-age, And all Mankind might thy vast Audience sit, And the whole world be justly made thy Stage: Still they shall taking be, and ever new, Still kept in vogue in spite of all the damning Crew; Till the last Scene of this great Theatre, Clos'd, and shut down, The numerous Actors all retire, And the grand Play of humane Life be done. IX. Beshrew those envious Tongues, who seek to blast thy Bays, Who Spots in thy bright Fame would find, or raise, And say, it only shines with borrow'd Rays; Rich in thy self, to whose unbounded store Exhausted Nature could vouchsafe no more, Thou could'st alone the Empire of the Stage maintain, Could'st all its Grandeur, and its Port sustain, Nor neededst others Subsidies to pay, Neededst no Tax on forein, or thy native Country lay, To bear the charges of thy purchas'd Fame, But thy own Stock could raise the same, Thy sole Revenue all the vast Expence defray: Yet like some mighty Conquerour in Poetry, Design'd by Fate of choice to be Founder of its new universal Monarchy, Boldly thou didst the learned World invade, Whilst all around thy pow'rful Genius sway'd, Soon vanquish'd Rome, and Greece were made submit, Both were thy humble Tributaries made, And thou return'dst in Triumph with their captive Wit. X. Unjust, and more ill-natur'd those, Thy spiteful, and malicious Foes, Who on thy happiest Talent fix a lye, And call that Slowness, which was Care, and Industry. Let me (with Pride so to be guilty thought) Share all thy wish'd Reproach, and share th' shame, If Diligence be deem'd a fault, If to be faultless must deserve their Blame: Judg of thy self alone (for none there were, Could be so just, or could be so severe) Thou thy own Works didst strictly try By known and uncontested Rules of Poetry, And gav'st thy Sentence still impartially: With rigour thou arraign'dst each guilty Line, And spar'dst no criminal Sense, because 'twas thine: Unbrib'd with Favour, Love, or Self-conceit, (For never, or too seldom we, Objects too near us, our own Blemishes can see) Thou didst no small'st Delinquencies acquit, But saw'st them to Correction all submit, Saw'st execution done on all convicted Crimes of Wit. XI. Some curious Painter, taught by Art to dare (For they with Poets in that Title share) When he would undertake a glorious Frame Of lasting Worth, and fadeless as his Fame; Long he contrives, and weighs the bold Design, Long holds his doubting hand ere he begin, And justly then proportions every stroke, and line, And oft he brings it to review. And oft he does deface, and dashes oft anew, And mixes Oils to make the flitting Colours dure, To keep 'em from the tarnish of injurious Time secure; Finish'd at length in all that Care, and Skill can do The matchless Piece is set to publick View, And all surpriz'd about it wond'ring stand, And tho no name be found below, Yet strait discern th' unimitable hand, And strait they cry 'tis Titian, or 'tis Angelo: So thy brave Soul, that scorn'd all cheap, and easie ways, And trod no common road to Praise, Would not with rash, and speedy Negligence proceed, (For who e're saw Perfection grow in haste? Or that soon done, which must for ever last?) But gently did advance with wary heed, And shew'd that mastery is most in justness read: Nought ever issued from thy teeming Breast, But what had gone full time, could write exactly best, And stand the sharpest Censure, and defie the rigid'st Test. XII. 'Twas thus th' Almighty Poet (if we dare Our weak, and meaner Acts with his compare) When he the Worlds fair Poem did of old design, That Work, which now must boast no longer date than thine; Tho 'twas in him alike to will, and do, Tho the same Word that spoke, could make it too, Yet would he not such quick, and hasty methods use, Nor did an instant (which it might) the great effect produce, But when th' All-wise himself in Council sate, Vouchsaf'd to think and be deliberate, When Heaven consider'd, and th' Eternal Wit, and sense, Seem'd to take time, and care, and pains, It shew'd that some uncommon Birth, That something worthy of a God was coming forth; Nought uncorrect there was, nought faulty there, No point amiss did in the large voluminous Piece appear, And when the glorious Author all survey'd, Survey'd whate're his mighty Labours made, Well-pleas'd he was to find All answer'd the great Model, and Idea of his Mind Pleas'd at himself He in high wonder stood, And much his Power, and much his Wisdom did applaud, To see how all was perfect, all transcendent Good. XIII. Let meaner spirits stoop to low precarious Fame, Content on gross and coarse Applause to live, And what the dull, and sensless Rabble give, Thou didst it still with noble scorn contemn, Nor would'st that wretched Alms receive, The poor subsistence of some bankrupt, sordid name: Thine was no empty Vapour, rais'd beneath, And form'd of common Breath, The false, and foolish Fire, that's whisk'd about By popular Air, and glares a while, and then goes out; But 'twas a solid, whole, and perfect Globe of light, That shone all over, was all over bright, And dar'd all sullying Clouds, and fear'd no darkning night; Like the gay Monarch of the Stars and Sky, Who wheresoe're he does display His sovereign Lustre, and majestick Ray, Strait all the less, and petty Glories nigh Vanish, and shrink away. O'rewhelm'd, and swallow'd by the greater blaze of Day; With such a strong, an awful and victorious Beam Appear'd, and ever shall appear, thy Fame, View'd, and ador'd by all th' undoubted Race of Wit, Who only can endure to look on it. The rest o'recome with too much light, With too much brightness dazled, or extinguish'd quite: Restless, and uncontroul'd it now shall pass As wide a course about the World as he, And when his long-repeated Travels cease Begin a new, and vaster Race, And still tread round the endless Circle of Eternity. THE NINTH ODE Of the Third Book of HORACE, IMITATED. A Dialogue betwixt the Poet and Lydia. Donec Gratus eram tibi, &amp;c. Hor. While you for me alone had Charms, And none more welcome fill'd your Arms, Proud with content, I slighted Crowns, And pitied Monarchs on their Thrones. Lyd. While you thought Lydia only fair, And lov'd no other Nymph but her, Lydia was happier in your Love, Than the bless'd Virgins are above. Hor. Now Chloes charming Voice, and Art Have gain'd the conquest of my Heart: For whom, ye Fates, I'd wish to die, If mine the Nymphs dear Life might buy. Lyd. Thyrsis by me has done the same, The Youth burns me with mutual Flame: For whom a double Death I'd bear; Would Fate my dearest Thyrsis spare. Hor. But say, fair Nymph, if I once more Become your Captive as before? Say, I throw off my Chloes chain, And take you to my Breast again? Lyd. Why then, tho he more bright appear, More constant than a fixed Star; Tho you than Wind more fickle be, And rougher than the stormy Sea. By Heav'n, and all its Pow'rs I vow I'd gladly live, and die with you. UPON A LADY, Who by overturning of a Coach, had her Coats behind flung up, and what was under shewn to the View of the Company. Out of Voiture. I Phillis, 'tis own'd, I am your Slave, This happy moment dates your Reign; No force of Humane Pow'r can save My captive Heart, that wears your chain: But when my Conquest you design'd; Pardon, bright Nymph, if I declare, It was unjust, and too severe, Thus to attack me from behind. II Against the Charms, your Eyes impart, With care I had secur'd my Heart; On all the wonders of your Face Could safely, and unwounded gaze: But now entirely to enthral My Breast, you have expos'd to view Another more resistless Foe, From which I had no guard at all. III At first assault constrain'd to yield, My vanquish'd Heart resign'd the Field, My Freedom to the Conquerour Became a prey that very hour: The subtle Traitor, who unspied Had lurk'd till now in close disguise, Lay all his life in ambush hid At last to kill me by surprize. IV A sudden Heat my Breast inspir'd, The piercing Flame, like Light'ning, sent From that new dawning Firmament Through every Vein my Spirits fir'd; My Heart, before averse to Love, No longer could a Rebel prove; When on the Grass you did display Your radiant Bum to my survey, And sham'd the Lustre of the Day. V The Sun in Heav'n, abash'd to see A thing more gay, more bright than He, Struck with disgrace, as well he might, Thought to drive back the Steeds of Light: His Beams he now thought useless grown, That better were by yours supplied, But having once seen your Back side, For shame he durst not shew his own. VI Forsaking every Wood, and Grove, The Sylvans ravish'd at the sight, In pressing Crowds about you strove, Gazing, and lost in wonder quite: Fond Zephyr seeing your rich store Of Beauty, undescried before, Enamour'd of each lovely Grace, Before his own dear Flora's face, Could not forbear to kiss the place. VII The beauteous Queen of Flow'rs, the Rose, In blushes did her shame disclose: Pale Lillies droop'd, and hung their heads, And shrunk for fear into their Beds: The amorous Narcissus too, Reclaim'd of fond self-love by you, His former vain desire cashier'd, And your fair Breech alone admir'd. VIII When this bright Object greets our sight, All others lose their Lustre quite: Your Eyes that shoot such pointed Rays, And all the Beauties of your Race, Like dwindling Stars, that fly away At the approach of brighter Day, No more regard, or value bear, But when its Glories disappear. IX Of some ill Qualities they tell, Which justly give me cause to fear; But that, which most begets despair, It has no sense of Love at all: More hard than Adamant it is, They say, that no Impression takes, It has no Ears, nor any Eyes, And rarely, very rarely speaks. X Yet I must love't, and own my Flame, Which to the world I thus rehearse, Throughout the spacious coasts of Fame To stand recorded in my Verse: No other subject, or design Henceforth shall be my Muses Theme, But with just Praises to proclaim The fairest Arse, that e're was seen. XI In pity gentle Phillis hide The dazling Beams of your Back-side; For should they shine unclouded long, All humane kind would be undone. Not the bright Goddesses on high, That reign above the starry Sky, Should they turn up to open view All their immortal Tails, can shew An Arse-h? so divine as you. CATULLUS EPIGR. VII. IMITATED. Quæris quot mihi basiationes, &amp;c. Nay, Lesbia, never ask me this, How many Kisses will suffice? Faith, 'tis a question hard to tell, Exceeding hard; for you as well May ask what sums of Gold suffice The greedy Miser's boundless Wish: Think what drops the Ocean store, With all the Sands, that make its Shore: Think what Spangles deck the Skies, When Heaven looks with all its Eyes: Or think how many Atoms came To compose this mighty Frame: Let all these the Counters be, To tell how oft I'm kiss'd by thee: Till no malicious Spy can guess To what vast height the Scores arise; Till weak Arithmetick grow scant, And numbers for the reck'ning want: All these will hardly be enough For me stark staring mad with Love. SOME ELEGIES OUT OF OVID'S Amours, IMITATED. Book II. Elegy IV. That he loves Women of all sorts and sizes. Non ego mendosos ausim defendere mores, &amp;c. Not I, I never vainly durst pretend My Follies, and my Frailties to defend: I own my Faults, if it avail to own, While like a graceless Wretch I still go on: I hate my self, but yet in spite of Fate Am fain to be that loathed thing I hate: In vain I would shake off this load of Love, Too hard to bear, yet harder to remove: I want the strength my fierce Desires to stem, Hurried away by the impetuous stream. 'Tis not one Face alone subdues my Heart, But each wears Charms, and every Eye a Dart: And wheresoe're I cast my Looks abroad, In every place I find Temptations strow'd, The modest kills me with her down-cast Eyes, And Love his ambush lays in that disguise. The Brisk allures me with her gaity, And shews how Active she in Bed will be: If Coy, like cloyster'd Virgins, she appears, She but dissembles, what she most desires: If she be vers'd in Arts, and deeply read, I long to get a Learned Maidenhead: Or if Untaught, and Ignorant she be, She takes me then with her simplicity: One likes my Verses, and commends each Line, And swears that Cowley's are but dull to mine: Her in mere Gratitude I must approve, For who, but would his kind Applauder love? Another damns my Poetry, and me, And plays the Critick most judiciously: And she too fires my Heart, and she too charms, And I'm agog to have her in my arms. One with her soft and wanton Trip does please, And prints in every step, she sets, a Grace: Another walks with stiff ungainly tread; But she may learn more pliantness abed, This sweetly sings; her Voice does Love inspire, And every Breath kindles, and blows the fire: Who can forbear to kiss those Lips, whose sound The ravish'd Ears does with such softness wound? That sweetly plays: and while her Fingers move, While o're the bounding Strings their touches rove, My Heart leaps too, and every Pulse beats Love: What Reason is so pow'rful to withstand The Magick force of that resistless Hand? Another Dances to a Miracle, And moves her numerous Limbs with graceful skill: And she, or else the Devil's in't, must charm, A touch of her would bed-rid Hermits warm. If tall; I guess what plenteous Game she'l yield, Where Pleasure ranges o're so wide a Field: If low; she's pretty: both alike invite, The Dwarf, and Giant both my wishes fit, Undress'd; I think how killing she'd appear, If arm'd with all Advantages she were: Richly attir'd; she's the gay Bait of Love, And knows with Art to set her Beauties off. I like the Fair, I like the Red-hair'd one, And I can find attractions in the Brown: If curling Jet adorn her snowy Neck, The beauteous Leda is reported Black: If curling Gold; Aurora's painted so: All sorts of Histories my Love does know. I like the Young with all her blooming Charms, And Age it self is welcome to my Arms: There uncropt Beauty in its flow'r assails, Experience here, and riper sense prevails. In fine, whatever of the Sex are known To stock this spacious and well-furnish'd Town; Whatever any single man can find Agreeable of all the num'rous kind: At all alike my haggard Love does fly, And each is Game, and each a Miss for me. Book II. Elegy V. To his Mistris that jilted him. Nullus amor tanti est: abeas pharetrate Cupido, &amp;c. Nay then the Devil take all Love! if I So oft for its damn'd sake must wish to die: What can I wish for but to die, when you. Dear faithless Thing, I find, could prove untrue? Why am I curs'd with Life? why am I fain For thee, false Jilt, to bear eternal Pain? 'Tis not thy Letters, which thy Crimes reveal, Nor secret Presents, which thy Falshood tell: Would God! my just suspicions wanted cause, That they might prove less fatal to my ease: Would God! less colour for thy guilt there were, But that (alas!) too much of proof does bear: Bless'd he, who what he loves can justifie, To whom his Mistris can the Fact deny, And boldly give his Jealousie the lye, Cruel the Man, and uncompassionate, And too indulgent to his own Regret, Who seeks to have her guilt too manifest, And with the murd'ring secret stabs his Rest. I saw, when little you suspected me, When sleep, you thought, gave opportunity, Your Crimes I saw, and these unhappy eyes Of all your hidden stealths were Witnesses: I saw in signs your mutual Wishes read, And Nods the message of your Hearts convey'd: I saw the conscious Board, which writ all o're With scrawls of Wine, Love's mystick Cypher bore: Your Glances were not mute, but each bewray'd, And with your Fingers Dialogues were made: I understood the Language out of hand, (For what's too hard for Love to understand?) Full well I understood for what intent All this dumb Talk, and silent Hints were meant: And now the Ghests were from the Table fled, And all the Company retir'd to bed. I saw you then with wanton Kisses greet, Your Tongues (I saw) did in your Kisses meet: Not such as Sisters to their Brothers give, But Lovers from their Mistrisses receive: Such as the God of War, and Paphian Queen Did in the height of their Embraces joyn. Patience, ye Gods! (I cried) what is't I see? Unfaithful! why this Treachery to me? How dare you let another in my sight Invade my native Property, and Right? He must not, shall not do't: by Love I swear I'll seize the bold usurping Ravisher: You are my Free-hold, and the Fates design, That you should be unalienably mine: These Favours all to me impropriate are: How comes another then to trespass here? This, and much more I said, by Rage inspir'd, While conscious shame her Cheeks with Blushes fir'd: Such lovely stains the face of Heav'n adorn, When Light's first blushes paint the bashful Morn: So on the Bush the flaming Rose does glow, When mingled with the Lillies neighb'ring Snow: This, or some other Colour much like these, The semblance then of here Complexion was: And while her Looks that sweet Disorder wore Chance added Beauties undisclos'd before: Upon the ground she cast her jetty Eyes, Her Eyes shot fiercer Darts in that Disguise: Her Face a sad and mournful Air express'd, Her Face more lovely seem'd in sadness dress'd: Urg'd by Revenge, I hardly could forbear, Her braided Locks, and tender Cheeks to tear: Yet I no sooner had her Face survey'd, But strait the tempest of my Rage was laid: A look of her did my Resentments charm, A look of her did all their Force disarm: And I, that fierce outrageous thing e're-while, Grow calm as Infants, when in sleep they smile: And now a Kiss am humbly fain to crave, She smil'd, and strait a throng of Kisses prest, The worst of which, should Jove himself but taste, The brandish'd Thunder from his Hand would wrest: Well-pleas'd I was, and yet tormented too, For fear my envied Rival felt them so: Better they seem'd by far than I ere taught, And she in them shew'd something new methought: Fond jealous I myself the Pleasure grutch, And they displeas'd, because they pleas'd too much: When in my mouth I felt her darting Tongue, My wounded Thoughts it with suspicion stung: Nor is it this alone afflicts my mind, More reason for complaint remains behind: I grieve not only that she Kisses gave, Tho that affords me cause enough to grieve: Such never could be taught her but in Bed, And Heav'n knows what Reward her Teacher had. Book II. Elegy X. To a Friend, Acquainting him, that he is in Love with two at one time. Tu mihi, tu certè (memini) Græcine, negabas, &amp;c. I've heard, my Friend, and heard it said by you, No man at once could ever well love two: But I was much deceiv'd upon that score, For single I at once love one, and more: Two at one time reign joyntly in my Breast, Both handsom are, both charming, both well-dress'd, And hang me, if I know, which takes me best: This Fairer is than that, and that than this, That more than this: and this than that does please: Tost, like a Ship, by diff'rent gusts of Love, Now to this Point, and now to that I move. Why, Love, why dost thou double thus my pains? Was't not enough to bear one Tyrant's chains? Why, Goddess, do'st thou vainly lavish more On one, that was top-full of Love before? Yet thus I'd rather love, than not at all, May that ill Curse my Enemies befal: May my worst Foe be damn'd to love of none, Be damn'd to Continence, and lie alone: Let Loves alarms each night disturb my Rest, And drowsie sleep never approach my Breast, Or strait-way thence be by new Pleasure chas'd. Let Pleasure in succession keep my Sense Ever awake, or ever in a Trance: Let me lie melting in my fair One's Arms, Riot in Bliss, and surfeit on her Charms: Let her undo me there without controul, Drain nature quite, suck out my very Soul: And, if by one I can't enough be drawn, Give me another, clap more Leeches on. The Gods have made me of the sporting kind, And for the Feat my Pliant Limbs design'd: What Nature has in Bulk to me denied, In Sinews, and in vigour is supplied: And should my Strength be wanting to Desire, Pleasure would add new Fewel to the Fire: Oft in soft Battels have I spent the Night, Yet rose next Morning vig'rous for the Fight, Fresh as the Day, and active as the Light: No Maid, that ever under me took pay, From my Embrace went unoblig'd away. Bless'd he, who in Loves service yields his Breath, Grant me, ye Gods, so sweet, so wish'd a Death! In bloudy Fields let Souldiers meet their Fate, To purchase dear bought Honour at the rate: Let greedy Merchants trust the faithless Main, And shipwrack Life and Soul for sordid gain: Dying, let me expire in gasps of Lust, And in a gush of Joy give up the Ghost: And some kind pitying Friend shall say of me, So did he live, and so deserv'd to die. A Fragment of PETRONIUS, PARAPHRAS'D. Fœda est in coitu, &amp; brevis voluptas, &amp;c. I hate Fruition, now 'tis past, 'Tis all but nastiness at best; The homeliest thing, that man can do, Besides, 'tis short, and fleeting too: A squirt of slippery Delight, That with a moment takes its flight: A fulsom Bliss, that soon does cloy, And makes us loath what we enjoy. Then let us not too eager run, By Passion blindly hurried on, Like Beasts, who nothing better know, Than what meer Lust incites them to: For when in Flouds of Love we're drench'd, The Flames are by enjoyment quench'd: But thus, let's thus together lie, And kiss out long Eternity: Here we dread no conscious Spies, No blushes stain our guiltless Joys: Here no Faintness dulls Desires, And Pleasure never flags, nor tires: This has pleas'd, and pleases now, And for Ages will do so: Enjoyment here is never done, But fresh, and always but begun. AN ODE OF ANACREON, PARAPHRAS'D. The CUP. ??? ??????? ????????, &amp;c. Make me a Bowl, a mighty Bowl, Large, as my capacious Soul, Vast, as my thirst is; let it have Depth enough to be my Grave; I mean the Grave of all my Care, For I intend to bury't there, Let it of Silver fashion'd be, Worthy of Wine, worthy of me, Worthy to adorn the Spheres, As that bright Cup amongst the Stars: That Cup which Heaven deign'd a place: Next the Sun its greatest Grace. Kind Cup! that to the Stars did go, To light poor Drunkards her below: Let mine be so, and give me light, That I may drink, and revel by't: Yet draw no shapes of Armour there, No Cask, nor Shield, nor Sword, nor Spear, Nor Wars of Thebes, nor Wars of Troy, Nor any other martial Toy: For what do I vain Armour prize, Who mind not such rough Exercise, But gentler Sieges, softer Wars, Fights, that cause no Wounds, or Scars? I'll have no Battels on my Plate, Lest sight of them should Brawls create, Lest that provoke to Quarrels too, Which Wine it self enough can do. Draw me no Constellations there, No Ram, nor Bull, nor Dog, nor Bear, Nor any of that monstrous fry Of Animals, which stock the sky: For what are Stars to my Design, Stars, which I, when drunk, out-shine, Out-shone by every drop of Wine? I lack no Pole-Star on the Brink, To guide in the wide Sea of Drink, But would for ever there be tost; And wish no Haven, seek no Coast. Yet, Gentle Artist, if thou'lt try Thy Skill, then draw me (let me see) Draw me first a spreading Vine, Make its Arms the Bowl entwine, With kind embraces, such as I Twist about my loving she. Let its Boughs o're-spread above Scenes of Drinking, Scenes of Love: Draw next the Patron of that Tree, Draw Bacchus and soft Cupid by; Draw them both in toping Shapes, Their Temples crown'd with cluster'd Grapes: Make them lean against the Cup, As 'twere to keep their Figures up: And when their reeling Forms I view, I'll think them drunk, and be so too: The Gods shall my examples be, The Gods, thus drunk in Effigy. An Allusion to MARTIAL. Book I. Epig. 118. As oft, Sir Tradewel, as we meet, You're sure to ask me in the street, When you shall send your Boy to me, To fetch my Book of Poetry, And promise you'l but read it o're, And faithfully the Loan restore: But let me ye as a Friend, You need not take the pains to send: 'Tis a long way to where I dwell, At farther end of Clarkenwel: There in a Garret near the Sky, Above five pair of Stairs I lie. But, if you'd have, what you pretend, You may procure it nearer hand: In Cornhil, where you often go, Hard by th' Exchange, there is, you know, A Shop of Rhime, where you may see The Posts all clad in Poetry; There H? lives of high renown, The noted'st Tory in the Town: Where, if you please, enquire for me, And he, or's Prentice, presently From the next Shelf will reach you down The Piece well bound for half a Crown: The Price is much too dear, you cry, To give for both the Book, and me: Yes doubtless, for such vanities, We know, Sir, you are too too wise. THE DREAM. Written, March 10. 1677. Late as I on my Bed reposing lay, And in soft sleep forgot the Toils of Day, My self, my Cares, and Love, all charm'd to Rest, And all the Tumults of my waking Breast, Quiet and calm, as was the silent Night, Whose stillness did to that bless'd sleep invite; I dreamt, and strait this visionary Scene Did with Delight my Fancy entertain. I saw, methought, a lonely Privacy, Remote alike from man's, and Heavens Eye, Girt with the covert of a shady Grove, Dark as my thoughts, and secret as my Love: Hard by a Stream did with that softness creep, As 'twere by its own murmurs husht asleep; On its green Bank under a spreading Tree, At once a pleasant, and a shelt'ring Canopy, There I, and there my dear Cosmelia sate, Nor envied Monarchs in our safe Retreat: So heretofore were the first Lovers laid On the same Turf of which themselves were made. A while I did her charming Glories view, Which to their former Conquests added new; A while my wanton hand was pleas'd to rove Through all the hidden Labyrinths of Love; Ten thousand Kisses on her Lips I fix'd, Which she with interfering Kisses mix'd, Eager as those of Lovers are in Death, When they give up their Souls too with the Breath. Love by these Freedoms first became more bold, At length unruly, and too fierce to hold: See then (said I) and pity, charming Fair, Yield quickly, yield; I can no longer bear Th' impatient Sallies of a Bliss so near: You must, and you alone these storms appease, And lay those Spirits which your Charms could raise; Come, and in equal Flouds let's quench our Flame, Come let's—and unawares I went to name The Thing, but stopt and blusht methought in Dream. At first she did the rude Address disown, And check'd my Boldness with an angry Frown, But yielding Glances, and consenting Eyes Prov'd the soft Traitors to her forc'd Disguise; And soon her looks, with anger rough e're while, Sunk in the dimples of a calmer smile: Then with a sigh into these words she broke, And printed melting Kisses as she spoke: Too strong, Philander, is thy pow'rful Art To take a feeble Maids ill-guarded Heart: Too long I've struggled with my Bliss in vain, Too long oppos'd what I oft wish'd to gain, Loath to consent, yet loather to deny, At once I court, and shun Felicity: I cannot, will not yield;—and yet I must, Lest to my own Desires I prove unjust: Sweet Ravisher! what Love commands thee, do; Tho I'm displeas'd, I shall forgive thee too, Too well thou know'st—and there my hand she press'd, And said no more, but blush'd and smil'd the rest. Ravish'd at the new grant, fierce eager I Leap'd furious on, and seiz'd my trembling Prey; With guarding Arms she first my Force repell'd, Shrunk, and drew back, and would not seem to yield; Unwilling to o'recome, she faintly strove, One hand pull'd to, what t'other did remove: So feeble are the struglings, and so weak In sleep we seem, and only seem to make: Forbear! (she said) ah, gentle Youth, forbear, (and still she hug'd, and clasp'd me still more near) Ah! will you? will you force my Ruin so? Ah? do not, do not, do not;—let me go. What follow'd was above the pow'r of Verse, Above the reach of Fancy to rehearse: Not dying Saints enjoy such Extasies, When they in Vision antedate their Bliss; Not Dreams of a young Prophet are so bless'd, When holy Trances first inspire his Breast, And the God enters there to be a Guest. Let duller Mortals other Pleasures prize, Pleasures which enter at the waking Eyes, Might I each Night such sweet Enjoyments find, I'd wink for ever, be for ever blind. A SATYR TOUCHING NOBILITY. Out of Monsieur BOILEAU. 'Tis granted, that Nobility in Man, Is no wild flutt'ring Notion of the Brain, Where he, descended of an ancient Race, Which a long train of numerous Worthies grace, By Virtues Rules guiding his steddy Course, Traces the steps of his bright Ancestors. But Yet I can't endure an haughty Ass, Debauch'd with Luxury and slothful Ease. Who besides empty Titles of high Birth, Has no pretence to any thing of Worth, Should proudly wear the Fame, which others sought, And boast of Honour which himself ne'er got. I grant, the Acts which his Fore-fathers did Have furnish'd matter for old Hollinshead, For which their Scutcheon, by the Conqu'ror grac'd Still bears a Lion Rampant for its Crest: But what does this vain mass of Glory boot To be the branch of such a noble Root, If he of all the Heroes of his Line Which in the Registers of Story shine, Can offer nothing to the World's regard, But mouldy Parchments which the Worms have spar'd? If sprung, as he pretends, of noble Race, He does his own Original disgrace, And, swoln with selfish Vanity and Pride, To greatness has no other claim beside, But squanders life, and sleeps away his days, Dissolv'd in Sloth, and steep'd in sensual ease: Mean while to see how much the Arrogant Boasts the false Lustre of his high Descent, You'd fancy him Comptroller of the Sky, And fram'd by Heav'n of other Clay than me. Tell me, great Hero, you, that would be thought So much above the mean, and humble Rout. Of all the Creatures which do men esteem? And which would you your self the noblest deem? Put case of Horse: No doubt, you'l answer strait, The Racer, which has often'st won the Plate: Who full of mettle, and of sprightly Fire, Is never distanc'd in the fleet Career: Him all the Rivals of New-market dread, And crowds of Vent'rers stake upon his Head: But if the Breed of Dragon, often cast, Degenerate, and prove a Jade at last; Nothing of Honour, or respect (we see) Is had of his high Birth, and Pedigree: But maugre all his great Progenitors. The worthless Brute is banish'd from the Course, Condemn'd for Life to ply the dirty Road, To drag some Cart, or bear some Carrier's Load. Then how can you with any sense expect That I should be so silly to respect The ghost of Honour, perish'd long ago, That's quite extinct, and lives no more in you? Such gaudy Trifles with the Fools may pass, Caught with mere shew, and vain Appearances: Virtue's the certain Mark, by Heav'n design'd, That's always stamp'd upon a noble mind: If you from such illustrious Worthies came, By copying them your high Extract proclaim: Shew us those generous Heats of Gallantry, Which Ages past did in those Worthies see, That zeal for Honour, and that brave Disdain, Which scorn'd to do an Action base, or mean: Do you apply your Interest aright, Not to oppress the Poor with wrongful Might? Would you make Conscience to pervert the Laws, Tho brib'd to do't, or urg'd by your own Cause? Dare you, when justly call'd, expend your Bloud In service for your King's and Countrys good? Can you in open Field in Armour sleep, And there meet danger in the ghastliest shape? By such illustrious Marks as these, I find, You're truly issued of a noble kind: Then fetch your Line from Albanact, or Knute, Or, if these are too fresh, from older Brute: At leisure search all History to find Some great and glorious Warriour to your mind: Take Cæsar, Alexander, which you please, To be the mighty Founder of your Race; In vain the World your Parentage bely, That was, or should have been your Pedegree. But, if you could with ease derive your Kin From Hercules himself in a right Line; If yet there nothing in your Actions be, Worthy the name of your high Progeny; All these great Ancestors, which you disgrace, Against you are a cloud of Witnesses: And all the Lustre of their tarnish'd Fame Serves but to light, and manifest your Shame: In vain you urge the merit of your Race, And boast that Bloud, which you your selves debase. In vain you borrow, to adorn your Name, The Spoils, and Plunder of another's Fame; If, where I look'd for something Great, and Brave, I meet with nothing but a Fool, or Knave, A Traitor, Villain, Sycophant, or Slave, A freakish Madman, fit to be confin'd, Whom Bedlam only can to order bind, Or (to speak all at once) a barren Limb, And rotten Branch of an illustrious Stem. But I am too severe, perhaps you'l think, And mix too much of Satyr with my Ink: We speak to men of Birth, and Honour here, And those nice Subjects must be touch'd with care: Cry mercy, Sirs! Your Race, we grant, is known; But how far backwards can you trace it down? You answer: For at least a thousand year, And some odd hundreds you can make't appear: 'Tis much: But yet in short the proofs are clear: All Books with your Fore-fathers Titles shine, Whose names have scap'd the general wreck of Time: But who is there so bold, that dares engage His Honour, that in this long Tract of Age No one of all his Ancestors deceas'd Had e're the fate to find a Bride unchast? That they have all along Lucretia's been, And nothing e're of spurious Bloud crept in, To mingle and defile the Sacred Line? Curss'd be the day, when first this vanity Did primitive simplicity destroy, In the bless'd state of infant time, unknown, When Glory sprung from Innocence alone Each from his merit only Title drew, And that alone made Kings, and Nobles too: Then, scorning borrow'd Helps to prop his Name, The Hero from himself deriv'd his Fame: But Merit by degenerate time at last, Saw Vice ennobled, and her self debas'd: And haughty Pride false pompous Titles feign'd, T'amuse the World, and Lord it o're Mankind: Thence the vast Herd of Earls, and Barons came, For Virtue each brought nothing but a Name: Soon after Man, fruitful in Vanities, Did Blazoning and Armory devise, Founded a College for the Herald's Art, And made a Language of their Terms apart, Compos'd of frightful words, of Chief, and Base, Of Chevron, Saltier, Canton, Bend, and Fess, And whatsoe're of hideous Jargon else Mad Guillim, and his barbarous Volume fills. Then farther the wild Folly to pursue, Plain down-right Honour out of fashion grew: But to keep up its Dignity, and Birth, Expence, and Luxury must set it forth: It must inhabit stately Palaces, Distinguish Servants by their Liveries, And carrying vast Retinues up and down. The Duke and Earl be by their Pages known. Thus Honour to support it self is brought To its last shifts, and thence the Art has got Of borrowing every where, and paying nought: 'Tis now thought mean, and much beneath a Lord To be an honest man, and keep his Word; Who, by his Peerage, and Protection safe, Can plead the priviledge to be a Knave: While daily Crowds of starving Creditors Are forc'd to dance attendance at his doors, Till he at length with all his mortgag'd Lands Are forfeited into the Banker's hands: Then to redress his wants, the bankrupt Peer To some rich trading Sot, turns Pensioner: And the next News, you're sure to hear that he Is nobly wed into the Company: Where for a Portion of ill-gotten Gold, Himself and all his Ancestors are sold: And thus repairs his broken Family At the expence of his own Infamy. For if you want Estate to set it forth, In vain you boast the splendor of your Birth: Your priz'd Gentility for madness goes, And each your Kindred shuns and disavows: But he that's rich is prais'd at his full rate, And tho he once cry'd Small-coal in the street, Tho he, nor none of his e're mentioned were, But in the Parish-Book, or Register. D?lé by help of Chronicle shall trace An hundred Barons of his ancient Race. A SATYR. Addressed to a Friend, that is about to leave the University, and come abroad in the World. If you're so out of love with Happiness, To quit a College life, and learned ease; Convince me first, and some good Reasons give, What methods and designs you'l take to live: For such Resolves are needful in the Case, Before you tread the worlds Mysterious Maze: Without the Premisses in vain you'l try To live by Systems of Philosophy: Your Aristotle, Cartes, and Le-Grand, And Euclid too in little stead will stand. How many men of choice, and noted parts, Well fraught with Learning, Languages, and Arts, Designing high Preferment in their mind, And little doubting good success to find, With vast and tow'ring thoughts have flock'd to Town, But to their cost soon found themselves undone, Now to repent, and starve at leisure left, Of miseries last Comfort, Hope bereft? These fail'd for want of good Advice, you cry, Because at first they fix'd on no employ: Well then, let's draw the Prospect, and the Scene To all advantage possibly we can: The world lies now before you, let me hear, What course your Judgment counsels you to steer: Always consider'd, that your whole Estate, And all your Fortune lies beneath your Hat: Were you the Son of some rich Usurer, That starv'd, and damn'd himself to make his Heir, Left nought to do, but to inter the Sot, And spend with ease what he with pains had got; 'Twere easie to advise how you might live, Nor would there need instruction then to give: But you, that boast of no Inheritance, Save that small Stock, which lies within your Brains, Learning must be your Trade, and therefore weigh With heed, how you your Game the best may play; Bethink your self a while, and then propose What way of Life is fitt'st for you to choose. If you for Orders, and a Gown design, Consider only this, dear Friend of mine, The Church is grown so over-stock'd of late, That if you walk abroad, you'l hardly meet More Porters now than Parsons in the street. At every Corner they are forc'd to ply, For Jobs of hawkering Divinity: And half the number of the Sacred Herd Are fain to strowl, and wander unpreferr'd: If this, or thoughts of such a weighty Charge Make you resolve to keep your self at large; For want of better opportunity, A School must your next Sanctuary be: Go, wed some Grammar-Bridewel, and a Wife, And there beat Greek, and Latin for your life: With Birchen Scepter there command at will, Greater than Busby's self, or Doctor Gill, But who would be to the vile Drudg'ry bound Where there so small encouragement is found? Where you for recompence of all your pains Shall hardly reach a common Fidler's gains? For when you've toil'd, and labour'd all you can, To dung, and cultivate a barren Brain: A Dancing Master shall be better paid, Tho he instructs the Heels, and you the Head: To such Indulgence are kind Parents grown, That nought costs less in Breeding than a Son: Nor is it hard to find a Father now, Shall more upon a Sotting-dog allow: And with a freer hand reward the Care Of training up his Spaniel, than his Heir. Some think themselves exalted to the Sky, If they light in some noble Family; Diet, an Horse, and thirty pounds a year, Besides the advantage of his Lordships ear, The credit of the business, and the State, Are things that in a Younster's Sense sound great. Little the unexperienc'd Wretch does know, What slavery he oft must undergo: Who tho in silken Skarf, and Cassock drest, Wears but a gayer Livery at best: When Dinner calls the Implement must wait With holy Words to consecrate the Meat: But hold it for a Favour seldom known, If he be deign'd the Honour to sit down. Soon as the Tarts appear, Sir Crape, withdraw! Those Dainties are not for a spiritual Maw: Observe your distance, and be sure to stand Hard by the Cistern with your Cap in hand: There for diversion you may pick your Teeth, Till the kind Voider comes for your Relief: For meer Board-wages such their Freedom sell, Slaves to an Hour, and Vassals to a Bell: And if th' enjoyment of one day be stole, They are but Pris'ners out upon Parole: Always the marks of slavery remain, And they, tho loose, still drag about their Chain. And where's the mighty Prospect after all, A Chaplainship serv'd up, and seven years Thrall? The menial thing perhaps for a Reward Is to some slender Benefice preferr'd, With this Proviso bound, that he must wed My Ladies antiquated Waiting-maid, In Dressing only skill'd, and Marmalade, Let others who such meannesses can brook, Strike Countenance to every Great man's Look: Let those that have a mind, turn slaves to eat, And live contented by another's Plate: I rate my Freedom higher, nor will I For Food and Rayment truck my Liberty. But, if I must to my last shifts be put, To fill a Bladder, and twelve yards of Gut; Rather with counterfeited wooden Leg, And my right Arm tied up, I'll chuse to beg: I'll rather chuse to starve at large, than be The gawdiest Vassal to Dependency. 'T has ever been the top of my Desires, The utmost height to which my wish aspires, That Heav'n would bless me with a small Estate, Where I might find a close obscure retreat; There, free from Noise, and all ambitious ends, Enjoy a few choice Books, and fewer Friends, Lord of my self, accountable to none, But to my Conscience, and my God alone: There live unthought of, and unheard of, die, And grudge Mankind my very memory. But since the Blessing is (I find) too great For me to wish for, or expect of Fate: Yet, maugre all the spight of Destiny, My Thoughts, and Actions are, and shall be free. A certain Author, very grave, and sage, This Story tells: no matter, what the Page. One time, as they walk'd forth e're break of day, The Wolf, and Dog encounter'd on the way: Famish'd the one, meager, and lean of plight, As a cast Poet, who for Bread does write: The other fat, and plump, as Prebend, was, Pamper'd with Luxury, and holy Ease, Thus met, with Complements, too long to tell, Of being glad to see each other well: How now, Sir Towzer? (said the Wolf) I pray, Whence comes it, that you look so sleek, and gay? While I, who do as well (I'm sure) deserve, For want of Livelihood am like to starve? Troth Sir (replied the Dog) 'thas been my Fate, I thank the friendly Stars, to hap of late On a kind Master, to whose care I owe All this good Flesh, wherewith you see me now: From his rich Voider every day I'm fed With Bones of Fowl, and Crusts of finest Bread: With Fricassee, Ragoust, and whatsoe're Of costly Kickshaws now in fashion are, And more variety of Boil'd and Roast, Than a Lord Mayor's Waiter e're could boast. Then, Sir, 'tis hardly credible to tell, How I'm respected, and belov'd by all: I'm the Delight of the whole Family, Not darling Shock more Favourite than I: I never sleep abroad, to Air expos'd, But in my warm apartment am inclos'd: There on fresh Bed of Straw, with Canopy Of Hutch above, like Dog of State I lie. Besides, when with high Fare, and Nature fir'd, To generous Sports of Youth I am inspir'd, All the proud shees are soft to my Embrace, From Bitch of Quality down to Turn-spit Race: Each day I try new Mistrisses and Loves, Nor envy Sovereign Dogs in their Alcoves. Thus happy I of all enjoy the best, No mortal Cur on Earth yet half so bless'd, And farther to enhance the Happiness, All this I get by idleness, and ease. Troth! (said the Wolf) I envy your Estate Would to the Gods it were but my good Fate, That I might happily admitted be A member of your bless'd Society! I would with Faithfulness discharge my place In any thing that I might serve his Grace: But, think you, Sir, it mould be feasible, And that my Application might prevail? Do but endeavour, Sir, you need not doubt; I make no question but to bring't about: Only rely on me, and rest secure, I'll serve you to the utmost of my Pow'r; As I'm a Dog of Honour, Sir:—but this I only take the Freedom to advise, That you'd a little lay your Roughness by, And learn to practice Complaisance, like me. For that let me alone: I'll have a care, And top my part, I warrant, to a hair: There's not a Courtier of them all shall vie For Fawning, and for Suppleness with me. And thus resolv'd at last, the Travellers Towards the House together shape their course: The Dog, who Breeding well did understand, In walking gives his Ghest the upper hand: And as they walk along, they all the while With Mirth, and pleasant Raillery beguile The tedious Time, and Way, till Day drew near, And Light came on; by which did soon appear The Mastiffs Neck to view all worn and bare. This when his Comrade spi'd, What means (said he) This Circle bare, which round your Neck I see? If I may be so bold;—Sir, you must know, That I at first was rough, and fierce, like you, Of Nature curs'd, and often apt to bite Strangers, and else, who ever came in sight: For this I was tied up, and underwent The Whip sometimes, and such light Chastisement: Till I at length by Discipline grew tame, Gentle, and tractable, as now I am: 'Twas by this short, and slight severity I gain'd these Marks and Badges, which you see: But what are they? Allons Monsieur! let's go. Not one step farther: Sir, excuse me now. Much joy t'ye of your envied, bless'd Estate: I will not buy Preferment at that rate: A Gods name, take your golden Chains for me: Faith, I'd not be a King, not to be free: Sir Dog, your humble Servant, so Godbw'y. SOME VERSE Written in Septemb. 1676. Presenting a Book to COSMELIA. Go, humble Gift, go to that matchless Saint, Of whom thou only wast a Copy meant: And all, that's read in thee, more richly find Compriz'd in the fair Volume of her mind; That living System, where are fully writ All those high Morals, which in Books we meet: Easie, as in soft Air, there writ they are, Yet firm, as if in Brass they graven were. Nor is her Talent lazily to know As dull Divines, and holy Canters do; She acts what they only in Pulpits prate, And Theory to Practice does translate: Nor her own Actions more obey her Will, Than that obeys strict Virtues dictates still: Yet does not Virtue from her Duty flow, But she is good, because she will be so: Her Virtue scorns at a low pitch to flie, Tis all free Choice, nought of Necessity: By such soft Rules are Saints above confin'd, Such is the Tie, which them to Good does bind. The scatter'd Glories of her happy Sex In her bright Soul as in their Center mix: And all that they possess but by Retail, She hers by just Monopoly can call: Whose sole Example does more Virtues shew, Than Schoolmen ever taught, or ever knew. No Act did e're within her Practice fall, Which for the atonement of a Bush could call: No word of hers e're greeted any ear, But what a Saint at her last gasp might hear: Scarcely her Thoughts have ever sullied been With the least print, or stain of native Sin: Devout she is, as holy Hermits are, Who share their time 'twixt Extasie, and Prayer: Modest, as infant Roses in their Bloom, Who in a Blush their fragrant Lives consume: So chaste, the Dead themselves are only more, Who lie divorc'd from Objects, and from Power: So pure, could Virtue in a Shape appear, 'Twould chuse to have no other Form, but Her: So much a Saint, I scarce dare call her so, For fear to wrong her with a name too low: Such the Seraphick Brightness of her mind, I hardly can believe her Womankind: But think some nobler Being does appear, Which to instruct the World, has lest the Sphere, And condescends to wear a Body here. Or, if she mortal be, and meant to show The greater Art by being form'd below; Sure Heaven preserv'd her by the Fall uncurs'd, To tell how good the Sex was made at first. THE PARTING. Too happy had I been indeed, if Fate Had made it lasting, as she made it great; But 'twas the Plot of unkind Destiny, To lift me to, then snatch me from my Joy: She rais'd my Hopes, and brought them just in view, And then in spight the pleasing Scene withdrew. So He of old the promis'd Land survey'd, Which he might see, but never was to tread: So Heav'n was by that damned Caitiff seen, He saw't, but with a mighty Gulf between, He saw't to be more wretched, and despair agen: Not Souls of dying Sinners, when they go, Assur'd of endless Miseries below, Their Bodies more unwillingly desert, Than I from you, and all my Joys did part. As some young Merchant, whom his Sire unkind Resigns to every faithless Wave, and Wind; If the kind Mistris of his Vows appear, And come to bless his Voyage with a Prayer, Such Sighs he vents as may the Gale increase, Such Flouds of Tears as may the Billows raise: And when at length the launching Vessel flies, And severs first his Lips, and then his Eyes; Long he looks back to see what he adores, And while he may, views the beloved Shores. Such just concerns I at your Parting had, With such sad Eyes your turning Face survey'd: Reviewing, they pursu'd you out of sight, Then sought to trace you by left Tracks of Light: And when they could not Looks to you convey, Tow'rds the lov'd Place they took delight to stray, And aim'd uncertain Glances still that way. Complaining of ABSENCE. Ten days (if I forget not) wasted are (A year in any Lover's Calendar) Since I was forc'd to part, and bid adieu To all my Joy, and Happiness in you: And still by the same Hindrance am detain'd, Which me at first from your lov'd Sight constrain'd Oft I resolve to meet my Bliss, and then My Tether stops, and pulls me back agen? So when our raised Thoughts to Heav'n aspire, Earth stifles them, and choaks the good desire. Curse on that Man, who Bus'ness first design'd, And by't enthral'd a free-born Lover's mind! A curse on Fate, who thus subjected me, And made me slave to any thing but thee! Lovers should be as unconfin'd as Air, Free as its wild Inhabitants from Care: So free those happy Lovers are above, Exempt from all Concerns but those of Love: But I, poor Lover militant below, The Cares, and Troubles of dull Life must know; Must toil for that, which does on others wait, And undergo the drudgery of Fate: Yet I'll no more to her a Vassal be, Thou now shalt make, and rule my Destiny: Hence troublesome Fatigues! all Bus'ness hence! This very hour my Freedom shall commence: Too long that Jilt has thy proud Rival been, And made me by neglectful Absence sin; But I'll no more obey its Tyranny, Nor that, nor Fate it self shall hinder me Henceforth from seeing, and enjoying thee. Promising a VISIT. Sooner may Art, and easier far divide The soft embracing waters of the Tide, Which with united Friendship still rejoyn, Than part my Eyes, my Arms, or Lips from thine: Sooner it may Time's headlong motion force, In which it marches with unalter'd course, Or sever this from the succeeding Day, Than from thy happy Presence force my stay. Not the touch'd Needle (emblem of my Soul) With greater Rev'rence trembles to its Pole, Nor Flames with surer instinct upwards go, Than mine, and all their motions tend to you. Fly swift, ye minutes, and contract the space Of Time, which holds me from her dear Embrace: When I am there I'll bid you kindly stay, I'll bid you rest, and never glide away. Thither when Bus'ness gives me a Release To lose my Cares in soft, and gentle Ease, I'll come, and all arrears of Kindness pay, And live o're my whole Absence in one day. Not Souls, releas'd from humane Bodies, move With quicker haste to meet their Bliss above: Than I, when freed from Clogs, that bind me now, Eager to seize my Happiness, will go. Should a fierce Angel arm'd with Thunder stand, And threaten Vengeance with his brandish'd hand, To stop the entrance to my Paradise; I'll venture, and his slighted Bolts despise. Swift as the wings of Fear, shall be my Love, And me to her with equal speed remove: Swift, as the motions of the Eye, or Mind, I'll thither fly, and leave slow Thought behind. THE CARELESS Good Fellow. SONG. Written, March 9. 1680. I A Pox of this fooling, and plotting of late, What a pother, and stir has it kept in the State? Let the Rabble run mad with Suspicions, and Fears, Let them scuffle, and jar, till they go by the ears: Their Grievances never shall trouble my pate, So I can enjoy my dear Bottle at quiet. II What Coxcombs were those, who would barter their ease And their Necks for a Toy, a thin Wafer and Mass? At old Tyburn they never had needed to swing, Had they been but true Subjects to Drink, and their King; A Friend, and a Bottle is all my design; He has no room for Treason, that's top-full of Wine. III I mind not the Members and makers of Laws, Let them fit or Prorogue, as his Majesty please: Let them damn us to Woollen, I'll never repine At my Lodging, when dead, so alive I have Wine: Yet oft in my Drink I can hardly forbear To curse them for making my Claret so dear. IV I mind not grave Asses, who idly debate About Right and Succession, the Trifles of State; We've a good King already: and he deserves laughter That will trouble his head with who shall come after: Come, here's to his Health, and I wish he may be As free from all Care, and all Trouble, as we. V What care I how Leagues with the Hollander go? Or Intrigues betwixt Sidney, and Monsieur D'Avaux? What concerns it my Drinking, if Casal be sold, If the Conquerour take it by Storming, or Gold? Good Bordeaux alone is the place that I mind, And when the Fleet's coming, I pray for a Wind. VI The Bully of France, that aspires to Renown By dull cutting of Throats, and vent'ring his own; Let him fight and be damn'd, and make Matches, and Treat, To afford the News-mongers, and Coffee-house Chat: He's but a brave Wretch, while I am more free, More safe, and a thousand times happier than He. VII Come He, or the Pope, or the Devil to boot, Or come Faggot, and Stake; I care not a Groat; Never think that in Smithfield I Porters will heat: No, I swear, Mr Fox, pray excuse me for that. I'll drink in defiance of Gibbet, and Halter, This is the Profession, that never will alter. A SATYR. The Person of Spencer is brought in, Dissuading the Author from the Study of Poetry, and shewing how little it is esteem'd and encouraged in this present Age. One night, as I was pondering of late On all the mis'ries of my hapless Fate, Cursing my rhiming Stars, raving in vain At all the Pow'rs, which over Poets reign: In came a ghastly Shape, all pale, and thin, As some poor Sinner, who by Priest had been, Under a long Lent's Penance, starv'd, and whip'd, Or par-boil'd Lecher, late from Hot-house crept: Famish'd his Looks appear'd, his Eyes sunk in, Like Morning-Gown about him hung his Skin: A Wreath of Lawrel on his Head he wore, A Book, inscrib'd the Fairy Queen, he bore. By this I knew him, rose, and bow'd, and said, Hail reverend Ghost! all hail most sacred Shade! Why this great Visit? why vouchsaf'd to me, The meanest of thy British Progeny? Com'st thou in my uncall'd, unhallow'd Muse, Some of thy mighty Spirit to infuse? If so; lay on thy Hands, ordain me fit For the high Cure, and Ministry of Wit: Let me (I beg) thy great Instructions claim, Teach me to tread the glorious paths of Fame: Teach me (for none does better know than thou) How, like thy self, I may immortal grow. Thus did I speak, and spoke it in a strain, Above my common rate, and usual vein; As if inspir'd by presence of the Bard, Who with a Frown thus to reply was heard, In stile of Satyr, such wherein of old He the fam'd Tale of Mother Hubberd told. I come, fond Ideot, e're it be too late, Kindly to warn thee of thy wretched Fate: Take heed betimes, repent, and learn of me To shun the dang'rous Rocks of Poetry: Had I the choice of Flesh and Bloud again, To act once more in Life's tumultuous Scene; I'd be a Porter, or a Scavenger, A groom, or any thing, but Poet here: Hast thou observ'd some Hawker of the Town, Who through the Streets with dismal Scream and Tone, Cries Matches, Small-coal, Brooms, Old Shooes and Boots, Socks, Sermons, Ballads, Lies, Gazetts, and Votes? So unrecorded to the Grave I'd go, And nothing but the Register tell, who: Rather that poor unheard of Wretch I'd be, Than the most glorious Name in Poetry, With all its boasted Immortality: Rather than He, who sung on Phrygia's Shore, The Grecian Bullies fighting for a Whore: Or He of Thebes, whom Fame so much extols For praising Jockies, and New-market Fools. So many now, and bad the Scriblers be, 'Tis scandal to be of the Company: The foul Disease is so prevailing grown, So much the Fashion of the Court and Town, That scarce a man well bred in either's deem'd, But who has kill'd, been often clapt, and oft has rhim'd: The Fools are troubled with a Flux of Brains, And each on Paper squirts his filthy sense: A leash of Sonnets, and a dull Lampoon Set up an Author, who forth with is grown A man of Parts, of Rhiming, and Renown: Ev'n that vile Wretch, who in lewd Verse each year Describes the Pageants, and my good Lord May'r, Whose Works must serve the next Election-day For making Squibs, and under Pies to lay, Yet counts himself of the inspired Train, And dares in thought the sacred Name profane. But is it nought (thou'lt say) in Front to stand, With Lawrel crown'd by White, or Loggan's hand? Is it not great, and glorious to be known, Mark'd out, and gaz'd at thro the wond'ring Town, By all the Rabble passing up and down? So Oats and Bedloe have been pointed at, And every busie Coxcomb of the State: The meanest Felons who through Holborn go, More eyes, and looks than twenty Poets draw: If this be all, go, have thy posted Name Fix'd up with Bills of Quack, and publick Sham; To be the stop of gaping Prentices, And read by reeling Drunkards, when they piss; Or else to lie expos'd on trading Stall, While the bilk'd Owner hires Gazetts to tell, 'Mongst Spaniels lost, that Authors does not sell. Perhaps, fond Fool, thou sooth'st thy self in dream, With hopes of purchasing a lasting Name? Thou think'st perhaps thy Trifles shall remain, Like sacred Cowley, and immortal Ben? But who of all the bold Adventurers, Who now drive on the trade of Fame in Verse Can be ensur'd in this unfaithful Sea, Where there so many lost and shipwrack'd be? How many Poems writ in ancient time, Which thy Fore-fathers had in great esteem, Which in the crowded Shops bore any rate, And sold like News Books, and Affairs of State, Have grown contemptible, and slighted since, As Pordage, Fleckno, or the British Prince? Quarles, Chapman, Heywood, Withers had Applause, And Wild, and Ogilby in former days; But now are damn'd to wrapping Drugs, and Wares, And curs'd by all their broken Stationers: And so may'st thou perchance pass up and down, And please a while th' admiring Court, and Town, Who after shalt in Duck-lane Shops be thrown, To mould with Silvester, and Shirley there, And truck for Pots of Ale next Stourbridg-Fair. Then who'l not laugh to see th' immortal Name To vile Mundungus made a Martyr Flame? And all thy deathless Monuments of Wit, Wipe Porters Tails, or mount in Paper-kite? But, grant thy Poetry should find success, And (which is rare) the squeamish Criticks please; Admit, it read, and prais'd, and courted be By this nice Age, and all Posterity; If thou expectest ought but empty Fame; Condemn thy Hopes, and Labours to the Flame: The Rich have now learn'd only to admire, He, who to greater Favours does aspire, Is mercenary thought, and writes to hire: Would'st thou to raise thine, and thy Countries Fame, Chuse some old English Hero for thy Theme, Bold Arthur, or great Edward's greater Son, Or our fifth Harry, matchless in Renown, Make Agincourt, and Cressy Fields outvie The fam'd Lavinian Shores, and Walls of Troy; What Scipio, what Mœcenas would'st thou find, What Sidney now to thy great Project kind? Bless me! how great Genius! how each Line Is big with Sense! how glorious a Design Does thro the whole, and each Proportion shine! How lofty all his Thoughts, and how inspir'd! Pity, such wond'rous Parts are not preferr'd: Cries a gay wealthy Sot, who would not bail For bare five Pounds the Author out of Jail, Should he starve there, and rot; who if a Brief Came out the needy Poets to relieve, To the whole Tribe would scarce a Tester give. But fifty Guinnies for a Whore and Clap; The Peer's well us'd, and comes off wond'rous cheap: A Poet would be dear, and out o'th' way, Should he expect above a Coach-man's pay: For this will any dedicate, and lye, And dawb the gaudy Ass with Flattery? For this will any prostitute his Sense To Coxcombs void of Bounty, as of Brains? Yet such is the hard Fate of Writers now, They're forc'd for Alms to each great Name to bow: Fawn, like her Lap-dog, on her tawdry Grace, Commend her Beauty, and bely her Glass, By which she every morning primes her Face: Sneak to his Honour, call him Witty, Brave, And Just, tho a known Coward, Fool, or knave, And praise his Lineage, and Nobility, Whose Arms at first came from the Company. 'Tis so, 'twas ever so, since heretofore The blind old Bard, with Dog and Bell before, Was fain to sing for Bread from door to door; The needy Muses all turn'd Gypsies then, And of the begging Trade e'er since have been: Should mighty Sappho in these days revive, And hope upon her stock of Wit to live; She must to Creswel's trudg to mend her Gains, And let her Tail to hire, as well as Brains. What Poet ever fin'd for Sheriff? or who By Wit and Sense did ever Lord Mayors grow? My own hard Usage here I need not press, Where you have every day before your face Plenty of fresh resembling Instances: Great Cowley's Muse the same ill Treatment had, Whose Verse shall live for ever to upbraid Th' ungrateful World, that left such Worth unpaid. Waller himself may thank Inheritance For what he else had never got by Sense. On Butler who can think without just Rage, The Glory, and the Scandal of the Age? Fair stood his hopes, when first he came to Town, Met every where with welcomes of Renown, Courted, and lov'd by all, with wonder read, And promises of Princely Favour fed: But what Reward for all had he at last, After a Life in dull expectance pass'd? The Wretch at summing up his mis-spent days Found nothing left, but Poverty, and Praise: Of all his Gains by Verse he could not save Enough to purchase Flannel, and a Grave: Reduc'd to want, he in due time fell sick, Was fain to die, and be interr'd on tick: And well might bless the Fever that was sent, To rid him hence, and his worse Fate prevent. You've seen what fortune other Poets share; View next the Factors of the Theatre: That constant Mart, which all the year does hold, Where Staple wit is barter'd, bought, and sold; Here trading Scriblers for their Maintainance, And Livelihood trust to a Lott'ry chance: But who his Parts would in the Service spend, Where all his hopes on Vulgar Breath depend? Where every Sot, for paying half a Crown, Has the Prerogative to cry him down? Sidley indeed may be content with Fame, Nor care should an ill-judging Audience damn: But Settle, and the Rest, that writ for Pence, Whose whole Estate's an ounce, or two of Brains, Should a thin House on the third day appear, Must starve, or live in Tatters all the year. And what can we expect that's brave and great, From a poor needy Wretch, that writes to eat? Who the success of the next Play must wait For Lodging, Food, and Cloaths, and whose chief care Is how to spunge for the next Meal, and where? Hadst thou of old in flourishing Athens liv'd, When all the learned Arts in Glory thriv'd, When mighty Sephocles the Stage did sway, And Poets by the State were held in pay; 'Twere worth thy Pains to cultivate thy Muse, And daily wonders then it might produce; But who would now write Hackney to a Stage, That's only thought the Nuisance of the Age? Go after this, and beat thy wretched Brains, And toil to bring in thankless Ideots means: Turn o're dull Horace, and the Classick Fools, To poach for Sense, and hunt for idle Rules: Be free of Tickets, and the Play-houses, To make some tawdry Act'ress there by Prize, And spend thy third Days gains 'twixt her clap'd Thighs. All Trades, and all Professions here abound, And yet Encouragement for all is found: Here a vile Emp'rick, who by Licence kills, Who every Week helps to increase the Bills, Wears Velvet, keeps his Coach, and Whore beside, For what less Villains must to Tyburn ride. There a dull trading Sot, in Wealth o'regrown By thriving Knavery, can call his own. A dozen Mannors, and if Fate still bless, Expect as many Counties to possess. Punks, Panders, Bawds, all their due Pensions gain, And every day the Great Mens Bounty drain: Lavish expence on Wit, has never yet Been tax'd amongst the Grievances of State, The Turky, Guinny, India Gainers be, And all but the Poetick Company: Each place of Traffick, Bantam, Smyrna, Zant, Greenland, Virginia, Sevil, Alicant, And France, that sends us Dildoes, Lace, and Wine, Vast profit all, and large Returns bring in: Parnassus only is that barren Coast, Where the whole Voyage, and Adventure's lost. Then be advis'd, the slighted Muse forsake, And Coke, and Dalton for thy study take: For Fees each Term sweat in the crowded Hall, And there for Charters, and crack'd Titles bawl: Where M?d thrives, and pockets more each year Than forty Laureats of the Theater, Or else to Orders, and the Church betake Thy self, and that thy future Refuge make: There fawn on some proud Patron to engage Th' Advowson of cast Punk, and Parsonage: Or sooth the Court, and preach up Kingly Right, To gain a Prebend'ry, and Mitre by't. In fine, turn Pettifogger, Canonist, Civilian, Pedant, Mountebank, or Priest, Soldier, or Merchant, Fidler, Painter, Fencer, Jack-pudding, Juggler, Player, or Rope-dancer: Preach, Plead, Cure, Fight, Game, Pimp, Beg, Cheat, or Thieve; Be all but Poet, and there's way to live. But why do I in vain my Counsel spend On one whom there's so little hope to mend? Where I perhaps as fruitlesly exhort, As Lenten Doctors, when they Preach at Court? Not enter'd Punks from Lust they once have tried, Not Fops, and Women from Conceit, and Pride, Not Bawds from Impudence, Cowards from Fear, Nor sear'd unfeeling Sinners past Despair, Are half so hard, and stubborn to reduce, As a poor Wretch, when once possess'd with Muse. If therefore, what I've said, cannot avail, Nor from the Rhiming Folly thee recal, But spite of all thou wilt be obstinate, And run thy self upon avoidless Fate; May'st thou go on unpitied, till thou be Brought to the Parish, Bridge, and Beggary: Till urg'd by want, like broken Scriblers, thou Turn Poet to a Booth, a Smithfield-Show, And write Heroick Verse for Bartholmew. Then slighted by the very Nursery, May'st thou at last be forc'd to starve, like me. A SATYR, In Imitation of the Third of JUVENAL. Written, May, 1682. The Poet brings in a Friend of his, giving him an account why he removes from London to live in the Country. Tho much concern'd to leave my dear old Friend, I must however his Design commend Of fixing in the Country: for were I As free to chuse my Residence, as he; The Peake, the Fens, the Hundreds, or Lands-end, I would prefer to Fleetstreet, or the Strand. What place so desart, and so wild is there, Whose Inconveniencies one would not bear, Rather than the Alarms of midnight Fire, The falls of Houses, Knavery of Cits, The Plots of Factions, and the noise of Wits, And thousand other Plagues, which up and down Each day and hour infest the cursed Town? As Fate wou'd have't, on the appointed day Of parting hence, I met him on the way, Hard by Mile-end, the place so fam'd of late, In Prose, and Verse for the great Factions Treat; Here we stood still, and after Complements Of course, and wishing his good Journey hence, I ask'd what sudden causes made him slie The once-lov'd Town, and his dear Company: When, on the hated Prospect looking back, Thus with just rage the good old Timon spake. Since Virtue here in no repute is had, Since Worth is scorn'd, Learning and Sense unpaid, And Knavery the only thriving Trade; Finding my slender Fortune every day Dwindle, and waste insensibly away, I, like a losing Gamester, thus retreat, To manage wiselier my last stake of Fate: While I have strength, and want no staff to prop My tott'ring Limbs, e're Age has made me stoop Beneath its weight, e're all my Thread be spun, And Life has yet in store some Sands to run, 'Tis my Resolve to quit the nauseous Town. Let thriving Morecraft chuse his dwelling there, Rich with the Spoils of some young spend-thrift Heir: Let the Plot-mongers stay behind, whose Art Can Truth to Sham, and Sham to Truth convert: Who ever has an House to Build, or Set, His Wife, his Conscience, or his Oath to let: Who ever has, or hopes for Offices, A Navy, Guard, or Custom-house's Place: Let sharping Courtiers stay, who there are great By putting the false Dice on King, and State. Where they, who once were Grooms, and Foot-Boys known, Are now to fair Estates, and Honours grown; Nor need we envy them, or wonder much At their fantastick Greatness, since they're such, Whom Fortune oft in her capricious freaks Is pleas'd to raise from Kennels, and the Jakes, To Wealth, and Dignity above the rest, When she is frolick, and dispos'd to jest. I live in London? What should I do there? I cannot lye, nor flatter, nor forswear: I can't commend a Book, or Piece of Wit, (Tho a Lord were the Author) dully writ: I'm no Sir Sydrophel to read the Stars, And cast Nativities for longing Heirs, When Fathers shall drop off: no Gadbury To tell the minute, when the King shall die, And you know what—come in: nor can I steer, And tack about my Conscience, whensoe're, To a new Point, I see Religion veer. Let others pimp to Courtier's Lechery, I'll draw no City-Cuckold's Curse on me: Nor would I do it, tho to be made great, And rais'd to the chief Ministry of State. Therefore I think it fit to rid the Town Of one, that is an useless member grown. Besides, who has pretence to Favour now, But he, who hidden Villany does know, Whose Breast does with some burning Secret glow? By none thou shalt preferr'd, or valued be, That trusts thee with an honest Secresie: He only may to great mens Friendship reach, Who Great Men, when he pleases, can impeach. Let others thus aspire to Dignity; For me, I'd not their envied Grandeur buy For all th' Exchange is worth, that Pauls will cost, Or was of late in the Scotch Voyage lost. What would it boot, if I, to gain my end, Forgo my Quiet, and my ease of mind, Still fear'd, at last betray'd by my great Friend. Another Cause, which I must boldly own, And not the least, for which I quit the Town, Is to behold it made the Common-shore, Where France does all her Filth, and Ordure pour: What Spark of true old English rage can bear Those, who were Slaves at home, to Lord it here? We've all our Fashions, Language, Complements, Our Musick, Dances, Curing, Cooking thence; And we shall have their Pois'ning too e're long, If still in the improvement we go on. What would'st thou say, great Harry, should'st thou view Thy gawdy flutt'ring Race of English now, Their tawdry Cloaths, Pulvilio's, Essences, Their Chedreux Perruques, and those Vanities, Which thou, and they of old did so despise? What Would'st thou say to see th' infected Town With the fowl Spawn of Foreiners o're-run? Hither from Paris, and all Parts they come, The Spue, and Vomit of their Goals at home; To Court they flock, and to St. James his Square, And wriggle into Great Mens Service there: Foot-boys at first till they, from wiping Shooes, Grow by degrees the Masters of the House: Ready of Wit, harden'd of Impudence, Able with ease to put down either H? Both the King's Player, and King's Evidence: Flippant of Talk, and voluble of Tongue, With words at will, no Lawyer better hung; Softer than flattering Court-Parasite, Or City-Trader, when he means to cheat: No Calling, or Profession comes amiss, A needy Monsieur can be what he please, Groom, Page, Valet, Quack, Operator, Fencer, Perfumer, Pimp, Jack-pudding, Juggler, Dancer: Give but the word; the Cur will fetch and bring, Come over to the Emperour, or King: Or, if you please, fly o're the Pyramid, Which J?n and the rest in vain have tried, Can I have patience, and endure to see The paltry Forein Wretch take place of me, Whom the same Wind, and Vessel brought ashore, That brought prohibited Goods, and Dildoes o're? Then, pray, what mighty Priviledge is there For me, that at my Birth drew English Air? And where's the Benefit to have my Veins Run British Bloud, if there's no difference 'Twixt me, and him, the Statute Freedom gave, And made a Subject of a true-born Slave? But nothing shocks, and is more loath'd by me, Than the vile Rascal's fulsom Flattery: By help of this false Magnifying Glass, A Louse, or Flea shall for a Camel pass: Produce an hideous Wight, more ugly far Than those ill Shapes, which in old Hangings are, He'l make him strait a Beau Garzon appear: Commend his Voice, and Singing, tho he bray Worse than Sir Martin Marr-all in the Play: And if he Rhime; shall praise for Standard Wit, More scurvy sense than Pryn, and Vickars Writ. And here's the mischief, tho we say the same, He is believ'd, and we are thought to sham: Do you but smile, immediately the Beast Laughs out aloud, tho he ne'r heard the Jest; Pretend, you're sad, he's presently in Tears, Yet grieves no more than Marble, when it wears Sorrow in Metaphor: but speak of Heat; O God! how sultry 'tis? he'l cry, and sweat In depth of Winter: strait, if you complain Of Cold; the Weather-glass is sunk again: Then he'l call for his Frize-Campaign, and swear 'Tis beyond Eighty, he's in Greenland here. Thus he shifts Scenes, and oft'ner in a day Can change his Face, than Actors at a Play: There's nought so mean, can scape the flatt'ring Sot, Not his Lord's Snuff-box, nor his Powder-Spot: If he but Spit, or pick his Teeth; he'l cry, How every thing becomes you? let me die, Your Lordship does it most judiciously: And swear, 'tis fashionable, if he Sneeze, Extremely taking, and it needs must please. Besides, there's nothing sacred, nothing free From the hot Satyr's rampant Lechery: Nor Wife, nor Virgin-Daughter can escape, Scarce thou thy self, or Son avoid a Rape: All must go pad-lock'd: if nought else there be, Suspect thy very Stables Chastity. By this the Vermin into Secrets creep, Thus Families in awe they strive to keep. What living for an English man is there, Where such as these get head, and domineer, Whose use and custom 'tis, never to share. A Friend, but love to reign without dispute, Without a Rival, full, and absolute? Soon as the Insect gets his Honour's ear, And fly-blows some of's poys'nous malice there, Strait I'm turn'd off, kick'd out of doors, discarded, And all my former Service disregarded. But leaving these Messieurs, for fear that I Be thought of the Silk-Weavers Mutiny, From the loath'd subject let us hasten on, To mention other Grievances in Town: And further, what Respect at all is had Of poor men here? and how's their Service paid, Tho they be ne'r so diligent to wait, To sneak, and dance attendance on the Great? No mark of Favour is to be obtain'd By one, that sues, and brings an empty hand: And all his merit is but made a Sport, Unless he glut some Cormorant at Court. 'Tis now a common thing, and usual here, To see the Son of some rich Usurer Take place of Nobles, keep his first-rate Whore, And for a Vaulting bout, or two give more Than a Guard-Captains Pay: mean while the Breed Of Peers, reduc'd to Poverty, and there Are fain to trudg to the Bank-side, and there Take up with Porters leavings, Suburb-Ware, There spend that Bloud, which their great Ancestor So nobly shed at Cressy heretofore, At Brothel-Fights in some foul Common-shore. Produce an Evidence, tho just he be, As righteous Job, or Abraham, or He, Whom Heaven, when whole Nature shipwrack'd was, Thought worth the saving, of all humane Race, Or t'other, who the flaming Deluge scap'd, When Sodom's Lechers Angels would have rap'd; How rich he is, must the first question be, Next for his Manners, and Integrity: They'l ask, what Equipage he keeps, and what He's reckon'd worth in Money, and Estate, For Shrieve how oft he has been known to fine, And with how many Dishes he does dine: For look what Cash a person has in store, Just so much Credit has he, and no more: Should I upon a thousand Bibles Swear, And call each Saint throughout the Calendar: To vouch my Oath; it won't be taken here; The Poor slight Heav'n, and Thunderbolts (they think) And Heav'n it self does at such Trifles wink. Besides, what store of gibing scoffs are thrown On one, that's poor, and meanly clad in Town; If his Apparel seem but overworn, His Stockings out at heel, or Breeches torn? One takes occasion his ript Shooe to flout, And swears 'thas been at Prison-Grates hung out: Another shrewdly jeers his coarse Crevat, Because himself wears Point: a third his Hat, And most unmercifully shews his Wit, If it be old, or does not cock aright: Nothing in Poverty so ill is born, As its exposing men to grinning scorn, To be by tawdry Coxcombs piss'd upon, And made the jesting-stock of each Buffoon. Turn out there, Friend! (cries one at Church) the Pew Is not for such mean scoundrel Curs, as you: 'Tis for your Betters kept: Belike, some Sot, That knew no Father, was on Bulks begot: But now is rais'd to an Estate, and Pride, By having the kind Proverb on his side: Let Gripe and Cheatwel take their Places there, And Dash the Scriv'ners gawdy sparkish Heir, That wears three ruin'd Orphans on his back: Mean while you in the Alley stand, and sneak: And you therewith must rest contented, since Almighty Wealth does put such difference. What Citizen a Son-in-law will take, Bred ne'r so well, that can't a Joynter make? What man of sense, that's poor, e're summon'd is Amongst the Common-Council to advise? At Vestry-Consults when does he appear, For choosing of some Parish-Officer, Or making Leather-Buckets for the Choir? 'Tis hard for any man to rise, that feels His Virtue clog'd with Poverty at heels: But harder 'tis by much in London, where A sorry Lodging, coarse, and slender Fare, Fire, Water, Breathing, every thing is dear: Yet such as these an earthen Dish disdain, With which their Ancestors, in Edgar's Reign, Were serv'd, and thought it no disgrace to dine, Tho they were rich, had store of Leather-Coin. Low as their Fortune is, yet they despise A man that walks the streets in homely Frize: To speak the truth, great part of England now In their own Cloth will scarce vouchsafe to go: Only, the Statutes Penalty to save, Some few perhaps wear Woollen in the Grave. Here all go gaily drest, altho it be Above their Means, their Rank, and Quality: The most in borrow'd Gallantry are clad; For which the Tradesmen's Books are still unpaid: This Fault is common in the meaner sort, That they must needs affect to bear the Port Of Gentlemen, though they want Income for't. Sir, to be short, in this expensive Town There's nothing without Money to be done: What will you give to be admitted there, And brought to speech of some Court-Minister? What will you give to have the quarter face, The squint and nodding go-by of his Grace? His Porter, Groom, and Steward must have Fees, And you may see the Tombs, and Tow'r for less: Hard Fate of Suitors! who must pay, and pray To Livery-slaves, yet oft go scorn'd away. Who e're at Barnet, or S. Albans fears To have his Lodging drop about his ears, Unless a sudden Hurricane befal, Or such a Wind as blew old Noll to Hell? Here we build slight, what scarce out-lasts the Lease, Without the helps of Props, and Buttresses: And Houses now adays as much require To be ensur'd from Falling, as from Fire. There Buildings are substantial, tho less neat, And kept with care both Wind, and Water-tight: There you in safe security are blest, And nought, but Conscience to disturb your Rest, I am for living where no Fires affright, No Bells rung backward break my sleep at night: I scarce lie down, and draw my Curtains here, But strait I'm rous'd by the next House on Fire: Pale, and half dead with Fear, my self I raise, And find my Room all over in a blaze: By this 'thas seiz'd on the third Stairs, and I Can now discern no other Remedy, But leaping out at Window to get free: For if the Mischief from the Cellar came, Be sure the Garret is the last, takes flame. The moveables of P?ge were a Bed For him, and's Wise, a Piss-pot by its side, A Looking-glass upon the Cupboards Head, A Comb-case, Candlestick, and Pewter-spoon, For want of Plate, with Desk to write upon: A Box without a Lid serv'd to contain Few Authors, which made up his Vatican: And there his own immortal Works were laid, On which the barbarous Mice for hunger prey'd: P? had nothing, all the world does know; And yet should he have lost this Nothing too, No one the wretched Bard would have suppli'd With Lodging, House-room, or a Crust of Bread. But if the Fire burn down some Great Man's House, All strait are interessed in the loss: The Court is strait in Mourning sure enough, The Act, Commencement, and the Term put off: Then we Mischances of the Town lament, And Fasts are kept, like Judgments to prevent. Out comes a Brief immediately, with speed To gather Charity as far as Tweed. Nay, while 'tis burning, some will send him in Timber, and Stone to build his House agen: Others choice Furniture: here some rare piece Of Rubens, or Vandike presented is: There a rich Suit of Moreclack-Tapestry, A Bed of Damask, or Embroidery: One gives a fine Scritore, or Cabinet, Another a huge massie Dish of Plate, Or Bag of Gold; thus he at length gets more By kind misfortune than he had before: And all suspect it for a laid Design, As if he did himself the Fire begin. Could you but be advis'd to leave the Town, And from dear Plays, and drinking Friends be drawn, An handsom Dwelling might be had in Kent, Surrey, or Essex, at a cheaper Rent Than what you're forc'd to give for one half year To lie, like Lumber, in a Garret here: A Garden there, and Well, that needs no Rope, Engine, or Pains to Crane its Waters up: Water is there through Natures Pipes convey'd, For which no Custom, or Excise is paid: Had I the smallest Spot of Ground, which scarce Would Summer half a dozen Grashoppers, Not larger than my Grave, tho hence remote, Far as St. Michaels Mount, I would go to't, Dwell there content, and thank the Fates to boot. Here want of Rest a nights more People kills Than all the College, and the weekly Bills: Where none have privilege to sleep, but those, Whose Purses can compound for their Repose: In vain I go to bed, or close my eyes, Methinks the place the middle Region is, Where I lie down in Storms, in Thunder rise: The restless Bells such Din in Steeples keep, That scarce the Dead can in their Church-yards sleep: Huzza's of Drunkards, Bell-mens midnight-Rhimes, The noise of Shops, with Hawkers early Screams, Besides the Brawls of Coach-men, when they meet, And stop in turnings of a narrow Street, Such a loud Medly of confusion make, As drowsie A?r on the Bench would wake. If you walk out in Bus'ness ne'r so great, Ten thousand stops you must expect to meet: Thick Crouds in every Place you must charge through, And storm your Passage, wheresoe'r you go: While Tides of Followers behind you throng, And, pressing on your heels, shove you along: One with a Board, or Rafter hits your Head, Another with his Elbow bores your side; Some tread upon your Corns, perhaps in sport, Mean while your Legs are cas'd all o're with Dirt. Here you the March of a slow Funeral wait, Advancing to the Church with solemn State: There a Sedan, and Lacquies stop your way, That bears some Punk of Honour to the Play: Now you some mighty piece of Timber meet, Which tott'ring threatens ruine to the Street: Next a huge Portland Stone, for building Pauls, If self almost a Rock, on Carriage rowls: Which, if it fall, would cause a Massacre, And serve at once to murder, and interr. If what I've said can't from the Town affright, Consider other dangers of the Night: When Brickbats are from upper Stories thrown, And emptied Chamber pots come pouring down From Garret Windows: you have cause to bless The gentle Stars, if you come off with Piss: So many Fates attend, a man had need, Ne'r walk without a Surgeon by his side: And he can hardly now discreet be thought, That does not make his Will, ere he go out. If this you scape, twenty to one, you meet Some of the drunken Scowrers of the Street, Flush'd with success of warlike Deeds perform'd, Of Constables subdu'd, and Brothels storm'd: These, if a Quarrel, or a Fray be mist, Are ill at ease a nights, and want their Rest. For mischief is a Lechery to some, And serves to make them sleep like Laudanum. Yet heated, as they are, with Youth, and Wine, If they discern a Train of Flamboes shine, If a Great Man with his gilt Coach appear, And a strong Guard of Foot-boys in the rear, The Rascals sneak, and shrink their Heads for fear. Poor me, who use no Light to walk about, Save what the Parish, or the Skies hang out, They value not: 'tis worth your while to hear The scuffle, if that be a scuffle, where Another gives the Blows, I only bear: He bids me stand: of force I must give way, For 'twere a sensless thing to disobey, And struggle here, where I'd as good oppose My self to P? and his Mastiffs loose. Who's there? he cries, and takes you by the Throat, Dog! are you dumb? Speak quickly, else my Foot Shall march about your Buttocks: whence d'ye come, From what Bulk-ridden Strumpet reeking home? Saving your reverend Pimpship, where d'ye ply? How may one have a Job of Lechery? If you say any thing, or hold your peace, And silently go off; 'tis all a case: Still he lays on: nay well, if you scape so: Perhaps he'l clap an Action on you too Of Battery: nor need he fear to meet A Jury to his turn, shall do him right, And bring him in large Damage for a Shooe Worn out, besides the pains, in kicking you. A Poor Man must expect nought of redress, But Patience: his best way in such a case Is to be thankful for the Drubs, and beg That they would mercifully spare one leg, Or Arm unbroke, and let him go away With Teeth enough to eat his Meat next day. Nor is this all, which you have cause to fear, Oft we encounter midnight Padders here: When the Exchanges, and the Shops are close, And the rich Tradesman in his Counting-house To view the Profits of the day withdraws. Hither in flocks from Shooters-Hill they come, To seek their Pride, and Booty nearer home: Your Purse! they cry; 'tis madness to resist, Or strive with a cock'd Pistol at your Breast: And these each day so strong and numerous grow, The Town can scarce afford them Jail-room now. Happy the times of the old Heptarchy, Ere London knew so much of Villany: Then fatal Carts through Holborn seldom went, And Tyburn with few Pilgrims was content: A less, and single Prison then would do, And serv'd the City, and the County too. These are the Reasons, Sir, which drive me hence, To which I might add more; would Time dispense, To hold you longer; but the Sun draws low, The Coach is hard at hand, and I must go: Therefore, dear Sir, farewel; and when the Town From better Company can spare you down, To make the Country with your Presence blest, Then visit your old Friend amongst the rest; There I'll find leisure to unlade my mind Of what Remarques I now must leave behind: The Fruits of dear Experience, which with these Improv'd will serve for hints, and notices; And when you write again, may be of use To furnish Satyr for your daring Muse. A Dithyrambick. The Drunkards Speech in a Mask. Written in Aug. 1677. ??? ???? ?????????? ?? ???? ???? I. Yes, you are mighty wise, I warrant, mighty wise! With all your godly Tricks, and Artifice, Who think to chouse me of my dear and pleasant Vice. Hence holy Sham! in vain your fruitless Toil: Go, and some unexperienc'd Fop beguile, To some raw ent'ring Sinner cant, and Whine, Who never knew the worth of Drunkenness and Wine. I've tried and prov'd, and found it all Divine: It is resolv'd, I will drink on, and die, I'll not one minute lose, not I, To hear your troublesom Divinity: Fill me a top-full Glass, I'll drink it on the Knee, Confusion to the next that spoils good Company. II. That Gulp was worth a Soul, like it, it went, And thorowout new Life, and Vigour sent: I feel it warm at once my Head, and Heart, I feel it all in all, and all in every part. Let the vile Slaves of Bus'ness toil, and strive, Who want the Leisure, or the Wit to live; While we Life's tedious journey shorter make, And reap those Joys which they lack sense to take. Thus live the Gods (if ought above our selves there be) They live so happy, unconcern'd, and free: Like us they sit, and with a careless Brow Laugh at the petty Jars of Humane kind below: Like us they spend their Age in gentle Ease, Like us they drink; for what were all their Heav'n, alas! If sober, and compell'd to want that Happiness. III. Assist almighty Wine, for thou alone hast Power, And other I'll invoke no more, Assist, while with just Praise I thee odore; Aided by thee, I dare thy worth rehearse, In Flights above the common pitch of groveling Verse. Thou art the Worlds great Soul, that heav'nly Fire, Which dost our dull half-kindled mass inspire. We nothing gallant, and above our selves produce, Till thou do'st finish Man, and Reinfuse. Thou art the only source of all, the world calls great, Thou didst the Poets first, and they the Gods create: To thee their Rage, their Heat, their Flame they owe, Thou runst half share with Art, and Nature too. They owe their Glory, and Renown to thee; Thou giv'st their Verse, and them Eternity. Great Alexander, that big'st Word of Fame, That fills her Throat, and almost rends the same, Whose Valour found the World too strait a Stage For his wide Victories, and boundless Rage, Got not Repute by War alone, but thee, He knew, he ne'r could conquer by Sobriety, And drunk as well as fought for universal Monarchy. IV. Pox o' that lazy Claret! how it stays? Were it again to pass the Seas; 'Twould sooner be in Cargo here, 'Tis now a long East-India Voyage, half a year. 'Sdeath! here's a minute lost, an Age, I mean, Slipt by, and ne'r to be retriev'd again. For pitty suffer not the precious Juyce to die, Let us prevent our own, and its Mortality: Like it, our Life with standing and Sobriety is pall'd, And like it too, when dead, can never be recall'd. Push on the Glass, let it measure out each hour, For every Sand an Health let's pour: Swift as the rowling Orbs above, And let it too as regularly move: Swift as Heav'ns drunken red-fac'd Traveller, the Sun, And never rest, till his last Race be done, Till time it self be all run out, and we Have drunk our selves into Eternity. V. Six in a hand begin! we'll drink it twice apiece. A Health to all that love, and honour Vice. Six more as oft to the great Founder of the Vine, (A God he was, I'm sure, or should have been) The second Father of Mankind I meant, He, when the angry Pow'rs a Deluge sent, When for their Crimes our sinful Race was drown'd, The only bold, and vent'rous man was found, Who durst be drunk agen, and with new Vice the World replant. The mighty Patriarch 'twas of blessed Memory, Who scap'd in the great Wreck of all Mortality, And stock'd the Globe afresh with a brave drinking Progeny, In vain would spightful Nature us reclaim, Who to small Drink our Isle thought fit to damn, And set us out o'th' reach of Wine, In hope strait Bounds could our vast Thirst confine. He taught us first with Ships the Seas to roam, Taught us from Forein Lands to fetch supply, Rare Art! that makes all the wide world our home, Makes every Realm pay Tribute to our Luxury, VI. Adieu poor tott'ring Reason! tumble down! This Glass shall all thy proud usurping Powers drown, And Wit on thy cast Ruines shall erect her Throne: Adieu, thou fond Disturber of our Life! That check'st our Joys, with all our Pleasure art at strife: I've something brisker now to govern me, A more exalted noble Faculty, Above thy Logick, and vain boasted Pedantry. Inform me, if you can, ye reading Sots, what 'tis, That guides th' unerring Deities: They no base Reason to their Actions bring, But move by some more high, more heavenly thing, And are without Deliberation wise: Ev'n such is this, at least 'tis much the same, For which dull Schoolmen never yet could find a name, Call ye this madness? damn that sober Fool, ('Twas sure some dull Philosopher, some reas'ning Tool) Who the reproachful Term did first devise, And brought a scandal on the best of Vice. Go, ask me, what's the rage young Prophets feel, When they with holy Frenzy reel: Drunk with the Spirits of infus'd Divinity, They rave, and stagger, and are mad, like me. VII. Oh, what an Ebb of Drink have we? Bring us a Deluge, fill us up the Sea, Let the vast Ocean be our mighty Cup; We'll drink't, and all its Fishes too like Loaches up. Bid the Canary Fleet land here: we'll pay The Fraight, and Custom too defray: Set every man a Ship, and when the Store Is emptied; let them strait dispatch, and Sail for more: 'Tis gone: and now have at the Rhine, With all its petty Rivulets of Wine: The Empire's Forces with the Spanish well combine, We'll make their Drink too in confederacy joyn. 'Ware France the next: this Round Bourdeaux shall swallow, Champagn, Langon, and Burgundy shall follow. Quick let's forestal Lorain; We'll starve his Army, all their Quarters drain, And without Treaty put an end to the Campagn, Go, set the Universe a tilt, turn the Globe up, Squeeze out the last, the slow unwilling Drop: A pox of empty Nature! since the World's drawn dry, 'Tis time we quit mortality, 'Tis time we now give out, and die, Lest we are plagu'd with Dulness and Sobriety. Beset with Link-boys, we'll in triumph go, A Troop of stagg'ring Ghosts down to the Shades below: Drunk we'll march off, and reel into the Tomb, Natures convenient dark Retiring Room; And there, from Noise remov'd, and all tumultuous strife, Sleep out the dull Fatigue, and long Debauch of Life. [Tries to go off, but tumbles down, and falls asleep. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REMAINS OF Mr. John Oldham IN VERSE and PROSE. To the Memory of Mr. OLDHAM. Farewel, too little and too lately known, Whom I began to think and call my own; For sure our Souls were near ally'd; and thine Cast in the same Poetick mould with mine. One common Note on either Lyre did strike, And Knaves and Fools we both abhorr'd alike: To the same Goal did both our Studies drive, The last set out the soonest did arrive. Thus Nisus fell upon the slippery place, While his young Friend perform'd and won the Race. O early ripe! to thy abundant store What could advancing Age have added more? It might (what Nature never gives the young) Have taught the numbers of thy native Tongue. But Satyr needs not those, and Wit will shine Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line. A noble Error, and but seldom made, When Poets are by too much force betray'd, Thy generous fruits, though gather'd ere their prime Still shew'd a quickness; and maturing time But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of Rime. Once more, hail and farewel; farewel thou young, But ah too short, Marcellus of our Tongue; Thy Brows with Ivy, and with Laurels bound; But Fate and gloomy Night encompass thee around. John Dryden. On the Death of Mr. John Oldham, A Pindarique Pastoral Ode. I Undoubtedly 'tis thy peculiar Fate, Ah, miserable Astragon! Thou art condemn'd alone To bear the Burthen of a wretched Life, Still in this howling Wilderness to roam, While all thy Bosom-friends unkindly go, And leave thee to lament them here below. Thy dear Alexis would not stay, Joy of thy Life, and Pleasure of thine Eyes, Dear Alexis went away With an invincible Surprize; Th' Angel-like Youth early dislik'd this State, And chearfully submitted to his Fate. Never did Soul of a Celestial Birth Inform a purer piece of Earth. O that 'twere not in vain To wish what's past might be retriev'd again! Thy Dotage, thy Alexis, then Had answer'd all thy Vows and Pray'rs, And Crown'd with pregnant Joys thy silver Hairs, Lov'd to this day among the living Sons of Men. II And thou, my Friend, hast left me too, Menalcas! poor Menalcas! even thou, Of whom so loudly Fame has spoke In the Records of her immortal Book, Whose disregarded Worth Ages to come Shall wail with Indignation o'er thy Tomb. Worthy wert thou to live, as long as Vice Should need a Satyr, that the frantick Age Might tremble at the Lash of thy poetick Rage. Th' untutor'd World in after Times May live uncensur'd for their Crimes, Freed from the Dreads of thy reforming Pen, Turn to old Chaos once again. Of all th' instructive Bards, whose more than Theban Lyre. Could savage Souls with manly Thoughts inspire, Menalcas worthy was to live. Say, you his Fellow-Shepherds that survive, Tell me, you mournful Swains, Has my ador'd Menalcas left behind; In all these pensive Plains A gentler Shepherd with a braver mind: Which of you all did more Majestick Show, Or wore the Garland on a sweeter Brow? III —But wayward Astragon resolves no more The Loss of his Menalcas to deplore: The place to which he wisely is withdrawn Is altogether blest; There no Clouds o'erwhelm his Breast, No Midnight Cares can break his Rest; For all is everlasting cheerful Dawn. The Poet's Bliss there shall he long possess, Perfect Ease and soft Recess; The treacherous World no more shall him deceive, Of Hope and Fortune he has taken Leave: And now in mighty Triumph does he reign, (His Head adorn'd with Beams of Light) O'er the unthinking Rabble's Spite, And the dull wealthy Fool's disdain. Thrice happy he that dies the Muses Friend, He needs no Obelisque, no Pyramid His sacred Dust to hide; He needs not for his Memory to provide; For he might well foresee his Praise can never end. Thomas Flatman. In memory of the Author. Take this short-summon'd loose unfinisht Verse Cold as thy Tomb, and suddain as thy Hears From my sick Thoughts thou canst no better crave, Who scarce drag Life, and envy thee thy Grave. Me Phœbus always faintly did inspire, And gave my narrow Breast more scanty Fire. My Hybla-Muse through humble Meads sought Spoil, Collecting little Sweets with mighty Toil; Yet when some Friend's just Fame did Theme afford, Her Voice amongst the tow'ring Swans was heard. In vain for such Attendance now I call, My Ink o'erflows with Spleen, my Blood with Gall; Yet, sweet Alexis, my Esteem of thee Was equal to thy Worth and Love for me. Death is thy Gain—that Thought affects me most, I care not what th' ill-natur'd World has lost. For Wit with thee expir'd, how shall I grieve? Who grudge th' ingrateful Age what thou didst leave, The Tribute of their Verse let others send, And mourn the Poet gone, I mourn the Friend. Enjoy thy Fate—thy Predecessors come, Cowley and Butler to conduct thee home. Who would not (Butler cries) like me engage New Worlds of Wit to serve a grateful Age? For such Rewards what Tasks will Authors shun? I pray, Sir, is my Monument begun? Enjoy thy Fate, thy Voice in Anthems raise; So well tun'd here on Earth to our Apollo's Praise: Let me retire, while some sublimer Pen Performs for thee what thou hast done for Homer and for Ben. N. T. On the ensuing Poems of Mr. John Oldham, and the Death of his good Friend the ingenious Author. Obscure and cloudy did the day appear, As Heaven design'd to blot it from the year; The Elements all seem'd to disagree, At least, I'm sure, they were at strife in me: Possest with Spleen, which Melancholy bred, When Rumor told me that my Friend was dead, That Oldham honour'd for his early Worth, Was cropt, like a sweet Blossom from the Earth, Where late he grew, delighting every Eye In his rare Garden of Philosophy. The fatal Sound new Sorrows did infuse, And all my Griefs were doubled at the News: For we with mutual Arms of Friendship strove, Friendship the true and solid part of Love; And he so many Graces had in store, That Fame or Beauty could not bind me more. His Wit in his immortal Verse appears, Many his Vertues were, tho' few his Years; Which were so spent as if by Heaven contriv'd, To lash the Vices of the longer liv'd. None was more skilful, none more learn'd than he, A Poet in its sacred Quality: Inspir'd above, and could command each Passion, Had all the Wit without the Affectation. A Calm of Nature still possest his Soul, No canker'd Envy did his Breast controul: Modest as Virgins that have never known The jilting Breeding of the nauseous Town; And easie as his Numbers that sublime His lofty Strains, and beautifie his Rhime, Till the Time's Ignomy inspir'd his Pen, And rowz'd the drowsie Satyr from his Den; Then fluttering Fops were his Aversion still, And felt the Power of his Satyrick Quill. The Spark whose Noise proclaims his empty Pate, That struts along the Mall with antick Gate; And all the Phyllis and the Chloris Fools Were damn'd by his invective Muse in Shoals. Who on the Age look'd with impartial Eyes, And aim'd not at the Person, but the Vice. To all true Wit he was a constant Friend, And as he well could judge, could well commend. The mighty Homer he with Care perus'd, And that great Genius to the World infus'd; Immortal Virgil, and Lucretius too, And all the Seeds o'th' Soul his Reason knew: Like Ovid, could the Ladies Hearts assail, With Horace sing, and lash with Juvenal. Unskill'd in nought that did with Learning dwell, But Pride to know he understood it well. Adieu thou modest Type of perfect Man; Ah, had not thy Perfections that began In Life's bright Morning been eclips'd so soon, We all had bask'd and wanton'd in thy Noon; But Fate grew envious of thy growing Fame, And knowing Heav'n from whence thy Genius came, Assign'd thee by immutable Decree A glorious Crown of Immortality, Snatch't thee from all thy mourning Friends below, Just as the Bays were planting on thy Brow. Thus worldly Merit has the Worlds Regard; But Poets in the next have their Reward; And Heaven in Oldham's Fortune seem'd to show, No Recompence was good enough below: So to prevent the Worlds ingrateful Crimes, Enrich'd his Mind, and bid him die betimes. T. Durfey. On the Death of Mr. John Oldham. Heark! is it only my prophetick Fear, Or some Death's sad Alarum that I hear? By all my Doubts 'tis Oldham's fatal Knell; It rings aloud, eternally farewel: Farewell thou mighty Genius of our Isle, Whose forward Parts made all our Nation smile, In whom both Wit and Knowledge did conspire, And Nature gaz'd as if she did admire How such few years such Learning could acquire: Nay seem'd concern'd that we should hardly find So sharp a Pen, and so serene a Mind. Oh then lament; let each distracted Breast With universal Sorrow be possest. Mourn, mourn, ye Muses, and your Songs give o'er; For now your lov'd Adonis is no more. He whom ye tutor'd from his Infant-years, Cold, pale and ghastly as the Grave appears: He whom ye bath'd in your lov'd murmuring Stream, Your daily pleasure, and your mighty Theme Is now no more; the Youth, the Youth is dead, The mighty Soul of Poetry is fled; Fled e'er his Worth or Merit was half known; No sooner seen, but in a Moment gone: Like to some tender Plant, which rear'd with Care, At length becomes most fragrant, and most fair; Long does it thrive, and long its Pride maintain, Esteem'd secure from Thunder, Storm or Rain; Then comes a Blast, and all the Work is vain. But Oh! my Friend, must we no more rehearse Thy equal Numbers in thy pleasing Verse? In Love how soft, in Satyr how severe? In Passion moving, and in Rage austere! Virgil in Judgment, Ovid in Delight, An easie Thought with a Meonian Flight; Horace in Sweetness, Juvenal in Rage, And even Biblis must each Heart engage! Just in his Praises, and what most desire, Wou'd flatter none for Greatness, Love or Hire; Humble, though courted, and what's rare to see, Of wondrous Worth, yet wondrous Modesty. So far from Ostentation he did seem, That he was meanest in his own Esteem. Alas, young man, why wert thou made to be At once our Glory and our Misery? Our Misery in losing thee is more Than could thy Life our Glory be before: For shou'd a Soul celestial Joys possess, And straight be banish'd from that Happiness, Oh, where would be its Pleasure? where it's Gain? The Bliss once tasted but augments the Pain: So having once so great a Prize in thee, How much the heavier must our Sorrows be? For if such Flights were in thy younger Days, What if thou'dst liv'd, O what had been thy Praise? Eternal Wreaths of never-dying Bays: But those are due already to thy Name, Which stands enroll'd in the Records of Fame; And though thy great Remains to Ashes turn, With lasting Praises we'll supply thy Urn, Which like Sepulchral Lamps shall ever burn. But hold! methinks, great Shade, I see thee rove Through the smooth Path of Plenty, Peace and Love; Where Ben. salutes thee first, o'erjoy'd to see The Youth that sung his Fame and Memory: Great Spencer next, with all the learned Train, Do greet thee in a Panegyrick Strain: Adonis is the Joy of all the Plain. Tho. Andrews. DAMON, an ECLOGUE On the untimely Death of Mr. Oldham. Corydon. Alexis. Beneath a dismal Yew the Shepherds sate, And talk'd of Damon's Muse and Damon's Fate: Their mutual Lamentations gave them Ease; For sometimes Melancholy it self does please: Like Philomel abandon'd to distress, Yet ev'n their Griefs in Musick they express. Cor. I'll sing no more since Verses want a Charm, The Muses could not their own Damon arm: At least I'll touch this useless Pipe no more, Unless, like Orpheus, I could Shades restore. A. Rather, like Orpheus, celebrate your Friend, And with your Musick Hell it self suspend: Tax Proserpine of Cruelty and Hate, And sing of Damon's Muse, and Damon's Fate. C. When Damon sung, he sung with such a Grace, Lord, how the very London-brutes did gaze! Sharp was his Satyr, nor allay'd with Gall; 'Twas Rage, 'twas generous Indignation all. A. Oh had he liv'd, and to Perfection grown, Not like Marcellus, only to be shown; He would have charm'd their Sence a nobler way, Taught Virgins how to sigh, and Priests to pray. C. Let Priests and Virgins then to him address, And in their Songs their Gratitude express, While we that know the Worth of easie Verse, Secure the Laurel to adorn his Herse. A. Codrus, you know, that sacred Badge does wear, And 'twere injurious not to leave it there; But since no Merit can strike Envy dumb, Do you with Baccar, guard and grace his Tomb. C. While you (dear Swain) with unaffected Rhime, Majestick, sad, and suited to the Time, His Name to future Ages consecrate, By praising of his Muse, and mourning of his Fate. A. Alas, I never must pretend to this, My Pipe scarce knows a Tune but what is his: Let future Ages then for Damon's sake, From his own Works a just Idæa take. Yet then, but like Alcides he'll be shown, And from his meanest part his Size be known. C. 'Twill be your Duty then to set it down. A. Once and but once (so Heav'n and Fate ordain) I met the gentle Youth upon the Plain, Kindly, cries he, if you Alexis be, And though I know you not you must be he, Too long already we have Strangers been; This Day, at least, our Friendship must begin. Let Business, that perverse Intruder, wait, To be above it is poetical and great. Then with Assyrian Nard our Heads did shine, While rich Sabæan Spice exalts the Wine; Which to a just Degree our Spirits fir'd; But he was by a greater God inspir'd: Wit was the Theme, which he did well describe, With Modesty unusual to his Tribe. But as with ominous Doubts, and aking Heart, When Lovers after first Enjoyment part, Not half content; for this was but a Taste, And wond'ring how the Minutes flew so fast, They vow a Friendship that shall ever last. So we—but Oh how much am I accurs'd! To think that this last Office is my first. Occasioned by the present Edition of the ensuing Poems, and the Death of the ingenious Author. Curs'd be the day when first this goodly Isle Vile Books, and useless thinking did defile. In Greek and Latin-Boggs our Time we waste, When all is Pain and Weariness at best: Mountains of Whims and Doubts we travel o'er, While treacherous Fancy dances on before: Pleas'd with our Danger still we stumble on, To late repent, and are too soon undone. Let Bodley now in its own Ruines lie, By th' common Hangman burnt for Heresie. Avoid the nasty learned Dust, 'twill breed More Plagues than ever Jakes or Dunghils did. The want of Dulness will the World undo, 'Tis Learning makes us mad and Rebels too. Learning, a Jilt which while we do enjoy, Slily our Rest and Quiet steals away; That greedily the Blood of Youth receives, And nought but Blindness and a Dotage gives. Worse than the Pox, or scolding Woman fly The awkward Madness of Philosophy. That Bedlam Bess, Religion never more Phantastick pie-ball'd, antick Dresses wore: Opinion, Pride, Moroseness gives a Fame; 'Tis Folly, christen'd with a modish Name. Let dull Divinity no more delight; It spoils the Man, and makes an Hypocrite. The chief Professors to Preferment fly, By Cringe and Scrape, the basest Simony. The humble Clown will best the Gospel teach, And inspir'd Ign'rance sounder Doctrines preach. A way to Heav'n mere Nature well does shew, Which reasoning and Disputes can never know. Yet still proud Tyrant Sence in Pomp appears, And claims a Tribute of full threescore Years. Sew'd in a Sack, with Darkness circl'd round, Each man must be with Snakes and Monkeys drown'd. Laborious Folly, and compendious Art, To waste that Life whose longest Date's too short. Laborious Folly, to wind up with Pain What Death unravels soon, and renders vain. We blindly hurry on in mystick ways, Nor wisely tread the Paths of solid Praise. There's nought deserves one precious drop of sweat, But Poetry, the noblest Gift of Fate, Which after Death does a more lasting Life beget. Not that which suddain, frantick Heats produce, Where Wine and Pride, not Heav'n shall raise the Muse. Not that small Stock which does Translators make; That Trade poor Bankrupt-Poetasters take: But such, when God his Fiat did express, And powerful Numbers wrought an Universe. With such great David tun'd his charming Lyre, That even Saul and Madness could admire. With such Great Oldham bravely did excell, That David's Lamentation sung so well. Oldham! the Man that could with Judgment write, Our Oxford's Glory, and the World's Delight. Sometimes in boundless keenest Satyr bold, Sometimes a soft as those Love-tales he told. That Vice could praise, and Vertue too disgrace; The first Excess of Wit that e'er did please. Scarce Cowley such Pindarique soaring knew, Yet by his Reader still was kept in view. His Fancy, like Jove's Eagle liv'd above, And bearing Thunder still would upward move. Oh Noble Kingston! had thy lovely Guest With a large stock of Youth and Life been Blest; Not all thy Greatness, and thy Vertues store Had surer Comforts been, or pleased thee more. But Oh! the date is short of mighty Worth, And Angels never tarry long on Earth. His soul, the bright, the pure Etherial Flame To those lov'd Regions flew, from whence it came. And spight of what Mankind had long believ'd, My Creed says only Poets can be sav'd. That God has only for a number staid, To stop the breach, which Rebel Angels made For none their absence can so well supply; They are all o're Seraphick Harmony. Then, and not that till then the World shall burn And its base Dross, Mankind their fortune mourn, While all to their old nothing quick return. The peevish Gritick then shall be asham'd, And for his Sins of Vanity be damn'd. Oxon, May the 26th. 1684. T. Wood. COUNTERPART TO THE SATYR against VERTUE. In Person of the Author. I. Pardon me, Vertue, whatsoe'er thou art, (For sure thou of the God-head art a part, And all that is of him must be The very Deity.) Pardon, if I in ought did thee blaspheme, Or injure thy pure Sacred Name: Accept unfeign'd Repentance, Prayers and Vows, The best Atonement of my penitent humble Muse, The best that Heav'n requires, or Mankind can produce. All my Attempts hereafter shall at thy Devotion be, Ready to consecrate my Ink and very Blood to thee. Forgive me, ye blest Souls that dwell above, Where you by its reward the worth of Vertue prove. Forgive (if you can do't) who know no Passion now but Love. And you unhappy happy few, Who strive with Life, and Humane Miseries below, Forgive me too, If I in ought disparag'd them, or else discourag'd you. II. Blest Vertue! whose Almighty Power Does to our fallen Race restore All that in Paradise we lost, and more, Lifts us to Heaven, and makes us be The Heirs and Image of the Deity. Soft gentle Yoak! which none but resty Fools refuse, Which before Freedom I would ever chuse. Easie are all the Bonds that are impos'd by thee; Easie as those of Lovers are, (If I with ought less pure may thee compare) Nor do they force, but only guide our Liberty: By such soft Ties are Spirits above confin'd; So gentle is the Chain which them to Good does bind. Sure Card, whereby this frail and tott'ring Bark we steer Thro' Life's tempestuous Ocean here; Thro' all the tossing Waves of Fear, And dangerous Rocks of black Despair. Safe in thy Conduct unconcern'd we move, Secure from all the threatning Storms that blow, From all Attacks of Chance below, And reach the certain Haven of Felicity above. III. Best Mistress of our Souls! whose Charms and Beauties last, And are by very Age encreast, By which all other Glories are defac'd. Thou'rt thy own Dowry, and a greater far Than All the Race of Woman-kind e'er brought, Tho' each of them like the first Wife were fraught, And half the Universe did for her Portion share. That tawdry Sex, which giddy senseless we Thro' Ignorance so vainly Deifie, Are all but glorious Brutes when un-endow'd with thee. 'Tis Vice alone, the truer Jilt, and worse, In whose Enjoyment tho' we find A flitting Pleasure, yet it leaves behind A Pain and Torture in the Mind, And claps the wounded Conscience with incurable Remorse, Or else betrays us to the great Trepans of Humane Kind. IV. 'Tis Vice, the greater Thraldom, harder Drudgery, Whereby deposing Reason from its gentle Sway, (That rightful Sovereign which we should obey) We undergo a various Tyranny, And to un-number'd servile Passions Homage pay. These with Ægyptian Rigor us enslave, And govern with unlimited Command; They make us endless Toil pursue, And still their doubled Tasks renew, To push on our too hasty Fate, and build our Grave, Or which is worse, to keep us from the Promis'd Land. Nor may we think our Freedom to retrieve, We struggle with our heavy Yoak in vain: In vain we strive to break that Chain, Unless a Miracle relieve; Unless th' Almighty Wand enlargement give, We never must expect Delivery, Till Death, the universal Writ of Ease, does set us free. V. Some sordid Avarice in Vassallage confines, Like Roman Slaves condemn'd to th' Mines; These are in its harsh Bridewel lash'd and punished, And with hard Labour scarce can earn their Bread. Others Ambition, that Imperious Dame, Exposes cruelly, like Gladiators, here Upon the World's Great Theatre. Thro' Dangers and thro' Blood they wade to Fame, To purchase grinning Honor and an empty Name. And some by Tyrant-Lust are Captive led, And with false Hopes of Pleasure fed; 'Till tir'd with Slavery to their own Desires, Life's o'er-charg'd Lamp goes out, and in a Snuff expires. VI. Consider we the little Arts of Vice, The Stratagems and Artifice Whereby she does attract her Votaries: All those Allurements and those Charms Which pimp Transgressors to her Arms, Are but foul Paint, and counterfeit Disguise, To palliate her own conceal'd Deformities, And for false empty Joys betray us to true solid Harms. In vain she would her Dowry boast, Which clog'd with Legacies we never gain, But with unvaluable Cost; Which got we never can retain; But must the greatest part be lost, To the great Bubbles, Age or Chance, again. 'Tis vastly over-balanc'd by the Joynture which we make, In which our Lives, our Souls, our All is set at Stake, Like silly Indians, foolish we With a known Cheat, a losing Traffick hold, Whilst led by an ill-judging Eye, W' admire a trifling Pageantry, And merchandize our Jewels and our Gold, For worthless Glass and Beads, or an Exchange's Frippery. If we a while maintain th' expensive Trade, Such mighty Impost on the Cargo's laid, Such a vast Custom to be paid, We're forc'd at last like wretched Bankrupts to give out, Clapt up by Death, and in Eternal Durance shut. VII. What art thou, Fame, for which so eagerly we strive? What art thou but an empty Shade By the Reflection of our Actions made? Thou, unlike others, never follow'st us alive; But, like a Ghost, walk'st only after we are dead. Posthumous Toy! vain after-Legacy! Which only ours can be, When we our selves no more are we! Fickle as vain! who dost on vulgar Breath depend, Which we by dear Experience find More changeable, more veering than th' unconstant Wind. What art thou, Gold, that cheat'st the Miser's Eyes? Which he does so devoutly idolize; For whom he all his Rest and Ease does sacrifice. 'Tis Use alone can all thy Value give, And he from that no Benefit can e'er receive. Curst Mineral! near Neighb'ring Hell begot, Which all th' Infection of thy damned Neighbourhood hast brought. Thou Bawd to Murthers, Rapes and Treachery, And every greater Name of Villany; From thee they all derive their Stock and Pedigree. Thou the lewd World with all its crying Crimes dost store, And hardly wilt allow the Devil the cause of more. And what is Pleasure which does most beguile? That Syren which betrays us with a flattering Smile. We listen to the treacherous Harmony, Which sings but our own Obsequy. The Danger unperceiv'd till Death draw nigh; Till drowning we want Pow'r to 'scape the fatal Enemy. VIII. How frantick is the wanton Epicure! Who a perpetual Surfeit will endure? Who places all his chiefest Happiness In the Extravagancies of Excess, Which wise Sobriety esteems but a Disease? O mighty envied Happiness to eat! Which fond mistaken Sots call Great! Poor Frailty of our Flesh! which we each day Must thus repair for fear of ruinous Decay! Degrading of our Nature, where vile Brutes are fain To make and keep up Man! Which, when the Paradise above we gain, Heav'n thinks too great an Imperfection to retain! By each Disease the sickly Joy's destroy'd; At every Meal it's nauseous and cloy'd, Empty at best, as when in Dream enjoy'd; When, cheated by a slumbering Imposture, we Fancy a Feast, and great Regalio's by; And think we taste, and think we see, And riot on imaginary Luxury. IX. Grant me, O Vertue, thy more solid lasting Joy; Grant me the better Pleasures of the Mind, Pleasures, which only in pursuit of thee we find, Which Fortune cannot marr, nor Chance destroy. One Moment in thy blest Enjoyment is Worth an Eternity of that tumultuous Bliss, Which we derive from Sense, Which often cloys, and must resign to Impotence. Grant me but this, how will I triumph in my happy State? Above the Changes and Reverse of Fate; Above her Favors and her Hate. I'll scorn the worthless Treasures of Peru, And those of t' other Indies too. I'll pity Cæsar's Self with all his Trophies and his Fame, And the vile brutish Herd of Epicures contemn, And all the Under-shrievalties of Life not worth a Name. Nor will I only owe my Bliss, Like others, to a Multitude, Where Company keeps up a forced Happiness; Should all Mankind surcease to live, And none but individual I survive, Alone I would be happy, and enjoy my Solitude. Thus shall my Life in pleasant Minutes wear, Calm as the Minutes of the Evening are, And gentle as the motions of the upper Air; Soft as my Muse, and unconfin'd as she, When flowing in the Numbers of Pindarique Liberty. And when I see pale gastly Death appear, That grand inevitable Test which all must bear, Which best distinguishes the blest and wretched here; I'll smile at all it Horrors, court my welcome Destiny, And yield my willing Soul up in an easie Sigh; And Epicures that see shall envy and confess, That I, and those who dare like me be good, the chiefest Good possess. Virg. ECLOGUE VIII. The Enchantment. Poet, Damon, Alpheus, Speakers. Damon and Alpheus, the two Shepherds Strains I mean to tell, and how they charm'd the Plains. I'll tell their charming Numbers which the Herd, Unmindful of their Grass, in Throngs admir'd. At which fierce Savages astonish'd stood, And every River stopt its list'ning Flood. For you, Great Sir, whether with Cannons Roar You spread your Terror to the Holland Shore, Or with a gentle and a steady Hand In Peace and Plenty rule your Native Land. Shall ever that auspicious Day appear, When I your glorious Actions shall declare? It shall, and I throughout the World rehearse Their Fame, fit only for a Spencer's Verse. With you my Muse began, with you shall end: Accept my Verse that waits on your Command; And deign this Ivy Wreath a place may find Amongst the Laurels which your Temples bind. 'Twas at the time that Night's cool shades withdrew, And left the Grass all hung with Pearly Dew; When Damon, leaning on his Oaken Wand, Thus to his Pipe in gentle Lays complain'd. D. Arise, thou Morning, and drive on the Day, While wretched I with fruitless words inveigh Against false Nisa, while the Gods I call With my last Breath, tho' hopeless to avail, Tho' they regard not my Complaints at all. Strike up my Pipe, play me in tuneful Strains What I heard sung on the Mænalian Plains. Mænalus ever has its warbling Groves, And talking Pines, it ever hears the Loves Of Shepherds, and the Notes of Mighty Pan, The first that would not let the Reeds untun'd remain. Strike up my Pipe, play me in tuneful Strains What I heard sung on the Mænalian Plains. Mopsus weds Nisa, Gods! what Lover e'er Need after this have reason to despair? Griffins shall now leap Mares, and the next Age The Deer and Hounds in Friendship shall engage. Go, Mopsus, get the Torches ready soon; Thou, happy Man, must have the Bride anon. Go, Bridegroom, quickly, the Nut-scramble make, The Evening-star quits Oeta for thy sake. Strike up my Pipe, play me in tuneful Strains What I heard sung on the Mænalian Plains. How fitly art thou match'd who wast so nice! Thou haughty Nymph who did'st all else despise! Who slight'st so scornfully my Pipe, my Herd, My rough-grown Eye-brows, and unshaven Beard, And think'st no God does mortal things regard. Strike up my Pipe, play me in tuneful Strains What I heard sung on the Mænalian Plains. I saw thee young, and in thy Beauty's Bloom, To gather Apples with thy Mother, come, 'Twas in our Hedge-rows, I was there with Pride, To shew you to the best, and be your Guide. Then I just entring my twelfth Year was found, I then could reach the tender Boughs from Ground. Heav'ns! when I saw, how soon was I undone! How to my Heart did the quick Poyson run! Strike up my Pipe, play me in tuneful Strains What I heard sung on the Mænalian Plains. Now I'm convinc'd what Love is; the cold North Sure in its craggy Mountains brought him forth, Or Africk's wildest Desarts gave him Birth, Amongst the Cannibals and Savage Race; He never of our Kind, or Countrey was. Strike up my Pipe, play me in tuneful Strains What I heard sung on the Mænalian Plains. Dire Love did once a Mother's Hand embrue In Childrens Blood; a cruel Mother, thou; Hard 'tis to say of both which is the worst, The cruel Mother, or the Boy accurst. He a curst Boy, a cruel Mother thou; The Devil a whit to chuse betwixt the two. Strike up my Pipe, play me in tuneful Strains What I heard sung on the Mænalian Plains. Let Wolves by Nature shun the Sheep-folds now: On the rough Oaks let Oranges now grow: Let the coarse Alders bear the Daffadill, And costly Amber from the Thorn distill: Let Owls match Swans, let Tyt'rus Orpheus be, In the Woods Orpheus, and Arion on the Sea. Strike up my Pipe, play me in tuneful Strains What I heard sung on the Mænalian Plains. Let all the World turn Sea, ye Woods adieu! To some high Mountain's top I'll get me now, And thence my self into the Waters throw. There quench my Flames, and let the cruel She Accept this my last dying Will and Legacy. Cease now my Pipe, cease now those warbling Strains Which I heard sung on the Mænalian Plains. This Damon's Song; relate ye Muses now Alpheus Reply: All cannot all things do. A. Bring Holy Water, sprinkle all around, And see these Altars with soft Fillets bound: Male-Frankincense, and juicy Vervain burn, I'll try if I by Magick Force can turn My stubborn Love: I'll try if I can fire His frozen Breast: Nothing but Charms are wanting here. Bring Daphnis from the Town, ye Magick Charms; Bring home lov'd Daphnis to my longing Arms. Charms in her wonted Course can stop the Moon, And from her well-fix'd Orb can call her down. By Charms the mighty Circe (we are told) Ulysses fam'd Companions chang'd of old. Snakes by the Vertue of Enchantment forc'd, Oft in the Meads with their own Poyson burst. Bring Daphnis from the Town, ye Magick Charms, Bring home lov'd Daphnis to my longing Arms. First, these three several Threads I compass round Thy Image, thus in Magick Fetters bound: Then round these Altars thrice thy Image bear: Odd Numbers to the Gods delightful are. Bring Daphnis from the Town, ye Magick Charms, Bring home lov'd Daphnis to my longing Arms. Go tie me in three knots three Ribands now, And let the Ribands be of diffrent Hue: Go, Amaryllis, tie them strait, and cry, At the same time, “They're true-love-knots, I tie. Bring Daphnis from the Town, ye Magick Charms, Bring home lov'd Daphnis to my longing Arms. Look how this Clay grows harder, and look how With the same Fire this Wax doth softer grow; So Daphnis, let him with my Love do so. Strow Meal and Salt (for so these Rites require) And set the crackling Laurel Boughs on fire: This naughty Daphnis sets my Brest on flame, And I this Laurel burn in Daphnis's Name. Bring Daphnis from the Town, ye Magick Charms, Bring home lov'd Daphnis to my longing Arms. As a poor Heifer, wearied in the Chase, Of seeking her lov'd Steer from place to place. Through Woods, through Groves, through Arable, and Wast, On some green River's bank lies down at last. There Lows her Moan, despairing, and forlorn, And, tho' belated, minds not to return: Let Daphnis's Case be such, and let not me Take any care to give a Remedy. Bring Daphnis from the Town, ye magick Charms, Bring home lov'd Daphnis to my longing Arms. These Garments erst the faithless Traitour left, Dear Pledges of his Love, of which I'me reft: Beneath the Threshold these I bury now, In thee, O Earth; these Pledges Daphnis owe. Bring Daphnis from the Town, ye Magick Charms, Bring home lov'd Daphnis to my longing Arms. Of Mæris I these Herbs and Poysons had, From Pontus brought: in Pontus store are bred: With these I've oft seen Mæris Wonders do, Turn himself Wolf, and to the Forest go: I've often seen him Fields of Corn displace, From whence they grew, and Ghosts in Church-yards raise. Bring Daphnis from the Town, ye Magick Charms, Bring home lov'd Daphnis to my longing Arms. Go, Maid, go, bear the Ashes out at door, And then forthwith into the neighb'ring current pour, Over thy Head, and don't look back be sure: I'll try, what these on Daphnis will prevail, The Gods he minds not, nor my Charms at all. Bring Daphnis from the Town, ye Magick Charms, Bring home lov'd Daphnis to my longing Arms. Behold! the Ashes while we lingring stay, While we neglect to carry them away, Have reach'd the Altar, and have fir'd the Wood, That lyes upon't: Heav'n send it be for good! Something I know not what's the matter: Hark! I hear our Lightfoot in the Entry bark, Shall I believe, or is it only Dream, Which Lovers fancies are too apt to frame? Cease now ye Magick Charms, behold him come! Cease needless Charms, my Daphnis is at home! To Madam L. E. upon her Recovery from a late Sickness. Madam, Pardon, that with slow Gladness we so late Your wish'd return of Health congratulate: Our Joys at first so throng'd to get abroad, They hinder'd one another in the crowd; And now such haste to tell their Message make, They only stammer what they meant to speak. You the fair Subject which I am to sing, To whose kind Hands this humble joy I bring: Aid me, I beg, while I this Theme pursue, For I invoke no other Muse but you. Long time had you here brightly shone below With all the Rays kind Heaven could bestow. No envious Cloud e're offer'd to invade Your Lustre, or compel it to a Shade: Nor did it yet by any Sign appear, But that you thoroughout Immortal were. Till Heaven (if Heaven could prove so cruel) sent To interrupt the Growth of your content. As if it grudg'd those Gifts you did enjoy, And would that Bounty which it gave, destroy: 'Twas since your Excellence did envy move In those high Powers and made them jealous prove. They thought these Glories should they still have shin'd Unsullied, were too much for Woman-kind. Which might they write as lasting, as they're Fair, Too great for ought, but Deities appear: But Heaven (it may be) was not yet compleat, And lackt you there to fill your empty Seat. And when it could not fairly woo you hence, Turn'd Ravisher, and offer'd Violence. Sickness did first a formal siege begin, And by sure slowness tryed your Life to win. As if by lingring methods Heaven meant To chase you hence and tire you to consent. But, this in vain, Fate did to force resort, And next by Storm shove to attack the fort. A Sleep, dull as your last, did you Arrest, And all there Magazines of life possest. No more the Blood its circling course did run, But in the veins, like Isicles, it hung. No more the Heart (now void of quickning heat) The tuneful March of vital Motion beat. Stiffness did into all the Sinews climb, And a short Death crept cold through every Limb. All Signs of Life from sight so far withdrew, 'Twas now thought Popery to pray for you. There might you (were not that sense lost) have seen How your true Death would have resented been: A Lethargy, like yours, each breast did seize, And all by Sympathy catcht your Disease. Around you silent Imagery appears, And nought in the Spectators moves, but Tears. They pay what grief were to your Funeral due, And yet dare hope Heaven would your Life renew. Mean while, all means, all drugs prescribed are, Which the decays of Health, or Strength repair, Medicines so powerful they new Souls would save, And Life in long-dead Carcasses retrieve: But these in vain, they rougher Methods try, And now your'e Martyr'd that you may not die; Sad Scene of Fate! when Tortures were your gain: And twas a kindness thought to wish you pain! As if the slackned string of Life run down, Could only by the Rack be screwed in tune. But Heav'n at last (grown conscious that its pow'r Could scarce what was to die with you restore.) And loth to see such Glories over-come, Sent a post Angel to repeal your doom; Strait Fate obey'd the Charge which Heaven sent, And gave this first dear Proof, it could Repent: Triumphant Charms! what may not you subdue, When Fate's your Slave, and thus submits to you! It now again the new-broke Thread does knit, And for another Clew her spindle fit: And life's hid spark which did unquencht remain, Caught the fled light and brought it back again: Thus you reviv'd, and all our Joy with you, Reviv'd and found their Resurrection too: Some only griev'd, that what was Deathless thought They saw so near to Fatal ruin brought: Now crowds of Blessings on that happy hand, Whose skill could eager Destiny withstand; Whose learned Pow'r has rescu'd from the Grave, That Life which 'twas a Miracle to save; That Life which were it thus untimely lost, Had been the fairest Spoil Death ere could boast: May he henceforth be God of healing thought, By whom such good to you and us was brought: Altars and shrines to him are justly due, Who shew'd himself a God by raising you: But say, fair Saint, for you alone can know, Whither your Soul in this short flight did go; Went it to antedate that Happiness, You must at last (though late we hope) possess? Inform us lest we should your Fate belye, And call that Death which was but Extasie, The Queen of Love (we're told) once let us see: That Goddesses from wounds could not be free; And you by this unwish'd Occasion show That they like Mortal us can Sickness know: Pitty! that Heav'n should all its Titles give, And yet not let you with them ever live. You'd lack no point that makes a Deity, If you could like it too Immortal be. And so you are; half boasts a Deathless State; Although your frailer part must yield to Fate. By every breach in that fair lodging made, Its blest Inhabitant is more displaid: In that white Snow which overspreads your skin, We trace ye whiter Soul which dwells within; Which while you through this shining Hue display Looks like a Star plac'd in the Milky way: Such the bright Bodies of the Blessed are, When they for Raiment cloath'd with Light appear, And should you visit now the Seats of Bliss, You need not wear another form but this. Never did Sickness in such pomp appear, As when it thus your Livery did wear, Disease it self look'd amiable here. So Clouds which would obscure the Sun oft gilded be, And Shades are taught to shine as bright as he. Grieve not fair Nymph, when in your Glass you trace The marring footsteps of a pale Disease. Regret not that your cheeks their Roses want, Which a few Days shall in full store replant, Which, whilst your Blood withdraws its guilty Red, Tells that you own no faults that blushes need: The Sun whose Bounty does each Spring restore What Winter from the rifled Meadows tore, Which every Morning with an early ray Paints the young Blushing Cheeks of instant Day: Whose skill (inimitable here below,) Limns those gay Clouds which form Heaven's colour'd bow, That Sun shall soon with Interest repay, All the lost Beauty Sickness snatch'd a way. Your Beams like his shall hourly now advance, And every minute their swift Growth enhance. Mean while (that you no helps of healths refuse) Accept these humble Wishes of the Muse: Which shall not of their Just Petition fail, If she (and she's a Goddess) ought prevail. May no profane Disease henceforth approach, This sacred Temple with unhallow'd touch, Or with rude sacriledge its frame debauch. May these fair Members always happy be In as full Strength and well-set Harmony, As the new Foundress of your sex could boast, Ere she by Sin her first Persecution lost: May Destiny, just to your Merits, twine, All your smooth Fortunes in a Silken Line. And that you may at Heaven late arrive, May it to you its largest Bottom give. May Heaven with still repeated Favours bless, Till it its Pow'r below its Will confess; Till wishes can no more exalt your Fate, Nor Poets fancy you more Fortunate. On the Death of Mrs. Katharine Kingscourt a Child of Excellent Parts and Piety. She did, She did—I saw her mount the Skie, And with new Whiteness paint the Galaxy. Heav'n her methought with all its Eyes did view, And yet acknowledg'd all its Eyes too few. Methought I saw in crowds blest Spirits meet, And with loud Welcomes her arrival greet; Which could they grieve, had gone with grief away To see a Soul more white, more pure than they. Earth was unworthy such a prize as this, Only a while Heaven let us share the Bliss: In vain her stay with fruitless Tears we'd woo, In vain we'd court, when that our Rival grew. Thanks, ye kind Powers! who did so long dispense, (Since you so wish'd her) with her absence thence: We now resign, to you alone we grant The sweet Monopoly of such a Saint; So pure a Saint, I scarce dare call her so, For fear to wrong her with a Name too low: Such a Seraphick brightness in her shin'd, I hardly can believe her Woman-kind. 'Twas sure some noble Being left the Sphere, Which deign'd a little to inhabit here, And can't be said to die, but disappear. Or if she Mortal was and meant to show The greater skill by being made below; Sure Heav'n preserv'd her by the fall uncurst, To tell how all the Sex were form'd at first: Never did yet so much Divinity In such a small Compendium crouded lye. By her we credit what the Learned tell, That many Angels in one point can dwell. More damned Fiends did not in Mary rest, Than lodg'd of Blessed Spirits in her Breast; Religion dawn'd so early in her mind, You'd think her Saint whilst in the Womb enshrin'd: Nay, that bright ray which did her Temples paint, Proclaim'd her clearly, while alive, a Saint. Scarce had she learnt to lisp Religion's Name, E'er she by her Example preach'd the same, And taught her Cradle-like the Pulpit to reclaim. No Action did within her Practice fall Which for th' Atonement of a Blush could call: No word of hers e'er greeted any Ear, But what a dying Saint confest might hear. Her Thoughts had scarcely ever sully'd been By the least Foot-steps of Original Sin. Her Life did still as much Devotion breath As others do at their last Gasp in Death. Hence on her Tomb of her let not be said, So long she liv'd; but thus, so long she pray'd. A Sunday-Thought in Sickness. My Pray'rs are heard, a glorious Light now shone, And (lo!) an Angel-Post comes hast'ning down: From Heav'n I see him cut the yielding Air; So swift, he seems at once both there and here; So quick, my sight in the pursuit was slow, And Thought could scarce so soon the Journey go. No angry Message in his Look appears, His Face no signs of threatning Vengeance wears. Comly his shape, of Heavenly Meen and Air, Kinder than Smiles of beauteous Virgins are. Such he was seen by the blest Maid of Old When he th' Almighty Infant's Birth foretold. A mighty Volume in one hand is born, Whose open'd Leaves the other seems to turn: Vast Annals of my Sins in Scarlet writ, But now eras'd, blot out, and cancell'd quite. Heark how the Heavenly Whisper strikes mine Ear, Mortal, behold thy Crimes all pardon'd here! Hail Sacred Envoy of th' Eternal King! Welcom as the blest Tidings thou dost bring. Welcom as Heav'n from whence thou cam'st but now, Thus low to thy great God and mine I bow, And might I here, O might I ever grow, Fix'd an unmov'd and endless Monument Of Gratitude to my Creator sent. TO THE MEMORY OF Mr. CHARLES MORWENT. A PINDARIQUE. Ignis utique quo clariùs effulsit, citiùs extinguitur, eripit se aufertque ex oculis subitò perfecta virtus: quicquid est absoluti faciliùs transfluit, &amp; optimi neutiquam diurnant. Cambden. de Phil. Syd. O celeres hominum bonorum dies. Apul. Ostendunt terris hunc tantùm fata, nec ultrà Esse sinunt. ? Virg. I. Best Friend! could my unbounded Grief but rate With due proportion thy too cruel Fate; Could I some happy Miracle bring forth, Great as my Wishes and thy greater Worth, All Helicon should soon be thine, And pay a Tribute to thy Shrine. The learned Sisters all transform'd should be, No longer nine, but one Melpomene: Each should into a Niobe relent, At once thy Mourner and thy Monument. Each should become Like the fam'd Memnon's speaking Tomb, To sing thy well-tun'd Praise; Nor should we fear their being dumb, Thou still would'st make 'em vocal with thy Rays. II. O that I could distil my vital Juice in Tears! Or waste away my Soul in sobbing Airs! Were I all Eyes, To flow in liquid Elegies: That every Limb might grieve, And dying Sorrow still retrieve; My Life should be but one long mourning day, And like moist Vapors melt in Tears away. I'd soon dissolve in one great Sigh, And upwards fly, Glad so to be exhal'd to Heav'n and thee. A Sigh which might well-nigh reverse thy death, And hope to animate thee with new Breath; Pow'rful as that which heretofore did give A Soul to well-form'd Clay, and made it live. III. Adieu, blest Soul! whose hasty Flight away Tells Heaven did ne'er display Such Happiness to bless the World with stay. Death in thy Fall betray'd her utmost spite, And shew'd her shafts most times are levell'd at the white. She saw thy blooming Ripeness time prevent; She saw, and envious grew, and straight her arrow sent, So Buds appearing e'er the Frosts are past, Nip'd by some unkind Blast, Wither in Penance for their forward haste. Thus have I seen a Morn so bright, So deck'd with all the Robes of Light, As if it scorn'd to think of Night, Which a rude Storm e'er Noon did shroud, And buried all its early Glories in a Cloud. The day in funeral Blackness mourn'd, And all to Sighs, and all to Tears it turn'd. IV. But why do we thy Death untimely deem; Or Fate blaspheme? We should thy full ripe Vertues wrong, To think thee young. Fate, when she did thy vigorous Growth behold, And all thy forward Glories told, Forgot thy tale of Years, and thought thee old. The brisk Endowments of thy Mind Scorning i'th' Bud to be confin'd, Out-ran thy Age, and left slow Time behind; Which made thee reach Maturity so soon, And at first Dawn present a full-spread Noon. So thy Perfections with thy Soul agree, Both knew no Non-age, knew no Infancy. Thus the first Patern of our Race began His Life in middle-age, at's Birth a perfect Man. V. So well thou acted'st in thy Span of Days, As calls at once for Wonder and for Praise. Thy prudent Conduct had so learnt to measure The different whiles of Toil and Leasure, No time did Action want, no Action wanted Pleasure. Thy busie Industry could Time dilate, And stretch the Thread of Fate: Thy careful Thrift could only boast the Power To lengthen Minutes, and extend an Hour. No single Sand could e'er slip by Without its Wonder, sweet as high: And every teeming Moment still brought forth A thousand Rarities of Worth. While some no other Cause for Life can give, But a dull Habitude to live: Thou scorn'dst such Laziness while here beneath, And Liv'dst that time which others only Breath. VI. Next our just Wonder does commence, How so small Room could hold such Excellence. Nature was proud when she contriv'd thy Frame, In thee she labor'd for a Name: Hence 'twas she lavish'd all her Store, As if she meant hereafter to be poor, And, like a Bankrupt, run o'th' Score. Her curious Hand here drew in Straights and joyn'd All the Perfections lodge in Humane kind; Teaching her numerous Gifts to lie Crampt in a short Epitome. So Stars contracted in a Diamond shine, And Jewels in a narrow Point confine The Riches of an Indian Mine. Thus subtle Artists can Draw Nature's larger self within a Span: A small Frame holds the World, Earth, Heav'ns and all Shrunk to the scant Dimensions of a Ball. VII. Those Parts which never in one Subject dwell, But some uncommon Excellence foretel, Like Stars did all constellate here, And met together in one Sphere. Thy Judgment, Wit and Memory conspir'd To make themselves and thee admir'd: And could thy growing Height a longer Stay have known, Thou hadst all other Glories, and thy self out-done. While some to Knowledge by Degrees arrive, Thro tedious Industry improv'd, Thine scorn'd by such pedantick Rules to thrive; But swift as that of Angels mov'd, And made us think it was intuitive. Thy pregnant Mind ne'er struggl'd in its Birth, But quick, and while it did conceive, brought forth; The gentle Throes of thy prolifick Brain Were all unstrain'd, and without Pain. Thus when Great Jove the Queen of Wisdom bare So easie and so mild his Travels were. VIII. Nor were these Fruits in a rough Soil bestown As Gemms are thick'st in rugged Quarries sown. Good Nature and good parts so shar'd thy mind, A Muse and Grace were so combin'd, 'Twas hard to guess which with most Lustre shin'd. A Genius did thy whole Comportment act, Whose charming Complaisance did so attract, As every Heart attack'd. Such a soft Air thy well-tun'd Sweetness sway'd, As told thy Soul of Harmony was made; All rude Affections that Disturbers be, That mar or disunite Society, Were Foreiners to thee. Love only in their stead took up its Rest; Nature made that thy constant Guest, And seem'd to form no other Passion for thy Breast. IX. This made thy Courteousness to all extend, And thee to the whole Universe a Friend. Those which were Strangers to thy native Soil and thee No Strangers to thy Love could be, Whose Bounds were wide as all Mortality. Thy Heart no Island was, disjoyn'd (Like thy own Nation) from all human kind; But 'twas a Continent to other Countreys fixt As firm by Love, as they by Earth annext. Thou scorn'dst the Map should thy Affection guide, Like theirs who love by dull Geography, Friends but to whom by Soil they are ally'd: Thine reacht to all beside, To every member of the world's great Family. Heav'ns Kindness only claims a Name more general, Which we the nobler call, Because 'tis common, and vouchsaf'd to all. X. Such thy Ambition of obliging was, Thou seem'dst corrupted with the very Power to please. Only to let thee gratifie, At once did bribe and pay thy Courtesie. Thy Kindness by Acceptance might be bought, It for no other Wages sought, But would its own be thought. No Suiters went unsatisfy'd away; But left thee more unsatisfy'd than they. Brave Titus! thou mightst here thy true Portraicture find, And view thy Rival in a private mind. Thou heretofore deserv'dst such Praise, When Acts of Goodness did compute thy days, Measur'd not by the Sun's, but thine own kinder Rays. Thou thoughtst each hour out of Life's Journal lost, Which could not some fresh Favor boast, And reckon'dst Bounties thy best Clepsydras. XI. Some Fools who the great Art of giving want, Deflower their Largess with too slow a Grant; Where the deluded Suitor dearly buy What hardly can defray The Expence of Importunities, Or the Suspense of torturing Delay. Here was no need of tedious Pray'rs to sue, Or thy too backward Kindness woo. It moved with no formal State, Like theirs whose Pomp does for intreaty wait: But met the swift'st Desires half way; And Wishes did well-nigh anticipate; And then as modestly withdrew, Nor for its due Reward of Thanks would stay. XII. Yet might this Goodness to the happy most accrue; Somewhat was to the miserable due, Which they might justly challenge too. Whate'er mishap did a known Heart oppress, The same did thine as wretched make; Like yielding Wax thine did th' Impressions take, And paint its Sadness in as lively Dress. Thou could'st afflictions from another Breast translate, And forein Grief impropriate; Oft-times our Sorrows thine so much have grown, They scarce were more our own; We seem'd exempt, thou suffer'dst all alone. XIII. Our small'st Misfortunes scarce could reach thy Ear, But made thee give in Alms a Tear; And when our Hearts breath'd their regret in sighs, As a just Tribute to their Miseries, Thine with their mournful Airs did symbolize. Like throngs of sighs did for its Fibres crowd, And told thy Grief from our each Grief aloud: Such is the secret Sympathy We may betwixt two neighb'ring Lutes descry, If either by unskilful hand too rudely bent Its soft Complaint in pensive murmurs vent, As if it did that Injury resent: Untoucht the other strait returns the Moan, And gives an Eccho to each Groan. From its sweet Bowels a sad Note's convey'd, Like those which to condole are made, As if its Bowels too a kind Compassion had. XIV. Nor was thy goodness bounded with so small extent, Or in such narrow Limits pent. Let Female Frailty in fond Tears distill, Who think that Moisture which they spill Can yield Relief, Or shrink the Current of anothers Grief, Who hope that Breath which they in sighs convey, Should blow Calamities away. Thine did a manlier Form express, And scorn'd to whine at an Unhappiness; Thou thought'st it still the noblest Pity to redress. So friendly Angels their Relief bestow On the unfortunate below For whom those purer minds no Passion know: Such Nature in that generous Plant is found, Whose every Breach does with a Salve abound, And wounds it self to cure another's Wound. In pity to Mankind it sheds its Juice, Glad with expence of Blood to serve their Use. First with kind Tears our Maladies bewails, And after heals; And makes those very Tears the remedy produce. XV. Nor didst thou to thy Foes less generous appear, (If there were any durst that Title wear.) They could not offer Wrongs so fast, But what were pardon'd with like haste; And by thy acts of Amnesty defac't. Had he who wish'd the Art how to forget, Discover'd its new Worth in thee, He had a double Value on it set, And justly scorn'd th' ignobler Art of Memory. No Wrongs could thy great Soul to Grief expose 'Twas plac't as much out of the reach of those, As of material Blows. No Injuries could thee provoke, Thy Softness always dampt the stroke: As Flints on Feather-beds are easiest broke. Affronts could ne'er thy cool Complexion heat, Or chafe thy temper from its setled State: But still thou stoodst unshockt by all, As if thou hadst unlearnt the Power to hate, Or, like the Dove, wert born without a Gall. XVI. Vain Stoicks who disclaim all Human Sense, And own no Passions to resent Offence, May pass it by with unconcern'd Neglect, And Vertue on those Principles erect, Where 'tis not a Perfection, but Defect. Let these themselves in a dull Patience please, Which their own Statues may possess, And they themselves when Carcasses. Thou only couldst to that high pitch arrive, To court Abuses, that thou mightst forgive: Wrongs thus in thy Esteem seem'd Courtesie, And thou the first was e'er oblig'd by Injury. XVII. Nor may we think these God-like Qualities Could stand in need of Votaries, Which heretofore had challeng'd Sacrifice. Each Assignation, each Converse Gain'd thee some new Idolaters. Thy sweet Obligingness could supple Hate, And out of it its Contrary create. Its powerful Influence made Quarrels cease, And Fewds dissolv'd into a calmer Peace. Envy resign'd her Force, and vanquish'd Spite Became thy speedy Proselyte. Malice could cherish Enmity no more; And those which were thy Foes before, Now wish'd they might adore. Cæsar may tell of Nations took, And Troops by Force subjected to his Yoke: We read as great a Conqueror in thee, Who couldst by milder ways all Hearts subdue, The nobler Conquest of the two; Thus thou whole Legions mad'st the Captives be, And like him too couldst look, and speak thy Victory. XVIII. Hence may we Calculate the Tenderness Thou didst Express To all, whom thou didst with thy Friendship bless: To think of Passion by new Mothers bore To the young Offspring of their Womb, Or that of Lovers to what they Adore, Ere Duty it become: We should too mean Ideas frame, Of that which thine might justly claim, And injure it by a degrading Name: Conceive the tender Care, Of guardian Angels to their Charge assign'd, Or think how dear To Heaven Expiring Martyrs are; These are the Emblems of thy mind, The only Types to shew how thou wast kind. XIX. On whom soe're thou didst confer this Tye 'Twas lasting as Eternity, And firm as the unbroken Chain of Destiny, Embraces would faint shadows of your Union show, Unless you could together grow. That Union which is from Alliance bred, Does not so fastly wed, Tho' it with Blood be cemented: That Link wherewith the Soul and Body's joyn'd, Which twists the double Nature in Mankind Only so close can bind. That holy Fire which Romans to their Vesta paid, Which they immortal as the Goddess made, Thy noble Flames most fitly parallel; For thine were just so pure, and just so durable. Those feigned Pairs of Faithfulness which claim So high a place in ancient Fame, Had they thy better Patern seen, They'd made their Friendship more divine And strove to mend their Characters by thine. XX. Yet had this Friendship no advantage been, Unless 'twere exercis'd within; What did thy Love to other Objects tie, The same made thy own Pow'rs agree, And reconcil'd thy self to thee. No Discord in thy Soul did rest, Save what its Harmony increast. Thy mind did with such regular Calmness move, As held resemblance with the greater Mind above. Reason there fix'd its peaceful Throne, And reign'd alone. The Will its easie Neck to Bondage gave, And to the ruling Faculty became a Slave. The Passions rais'd no Civil Wars, Nor discompos'd thee with intestine Jars: All did obey, And paid Allegiance to its rightful Sway. All threw their resty Tempers by, And gentler Figures drew, Gentle as Nature in its Infancy, As when themselves in their first Beings grew. XXI. Thy Soul within such silent Pomp did keep, As if Humanity were lull'd asleep. So gentle was thy Pilgrimage beneath, Time's unheard Feet scarce make less Noise Or the soft Journey which a Planet goes. Life seem'd all calm as its last Breath. A still Tranquillity so husht thy Breast, As if some Halcyon were its Guest, And there had built her Nest; It hardly now enjoys a greater Rest. As that smooth Sea which wears the Name of Peace Still with one even Face appears, And feels no Tides to change it from its place, No Waves to alter the fair Form it bears: As that unspotted Sky, Where Nile does want of Rain supply, Is free from Clouds, from Storms is ever free. So thy unvary'd mind was always one, And with such clear Serenity still shone, As caus'd thy little World to seem all temp'rate Zone. XXII. Let Fools their high Extraction boast, And Greatness, which no Travel, but their Mothers, cost. Let 'em extol a swelling Name, Which theirs by Will and Testament became; At best but meer Inheritance, As oft the Spoils as Gift of Chance. Let some ill-plac't Repute on Scutcheons rear As fading as the Colors which those bear; And prize a painted Field, Which Wealth as soon as Fame can yield. Thou scorn'dst at such low rates to purchase worth, Nor couldst thou owe it only to thy Birth. Thy self-born Greatness was above the Power Of Parents to entail, or Fortune to deflower. Thy Soul, which like the Sun, Heaven molded bright, Disdain'd to shine with borrow'd Light. Thus from himself th' Eternal Being grew, And from no other Cause his Grandeur drew. XXIII. Howe'er if true Nobility Rather in Souls than in the Blood does lie: If from thy better part we Measures take, And that the Standard of our Value make, Jewels and Stars become low Heraldry To blazon thee. Thy Soul was big enough to pity Kings, And lookt on Empires as poor humble things. Great as his boundless mind, Who thought himself in one wide Globe confin'd, And for another pin'd. Great as that Spirit whose large Powers rowl Thro' the vast Fabrick of this spatious Bowl, And tell the World as well as Man can boast a Soul. XXIV. Yet could not this an Haughtiness beget, Or thee above the common Level set. Pride, whose Alloy does best Endowments mar, (As things most lofty smaller still appear) With thee did no Alliance bear. Low Merits oft are by too high Esteem bely'd, Whose owners lessen while they raise their Price; Thine were above the very Guilt of Pride, Above all others, and thy own Hyperbole: In thee the wid'st Extreams were joyn'd The loftiest, and the lowliest Mind. Thus tho some part of Heav'ns vast Round, Appear but low, and seem to touch the Ground. Yet 'tis well known almost to bound the Spheres, 'Tis truly held to be above the Stars. XXV. While thy brave Mind preserv'd this noble Frame, Thou stoodst at once secure From all the Flattery and Obloquy of Fame, Its rough and gentler Breath were both to thee the same: Nor this could thee exalt, nor that depress thee lower; But thou from thy great Soul on both look'dst down Without the small concernment of a smile or frown. Heav'n less dreads that it should fir'd be By the weak flitting Sparks that upwards fly, Less the bright Goddess of the Night Fears those loud howlings that revile her Light Than thou malignant Tongues thy Worth should blast, Which was too great for Envy's Cloud to overcast. 'Twas thy brave Method to despise Contempt, And make what was the Fault the Punishment. What more Assaults could weak Detraction raise, When thou couldst Saint disgrace, And turn Reproach to Praise. So Clouds which would obscure the Sun, oft guilded be, And Shades are taught to shine as bright as he. So Diamonds, when envious Night Would shroud their Splendor, look most bright, And from its Darkness seem to borrow Light. XXVI. Had Heaven compos'd thy mortal Frame, Free from Contagion as thy Soul or Fame: Could Vertue been but Proof against Death's Arms, Th' adst stood unvanquisht by these Harms, Safe in a Circle made by thy own Charms. Fond Pleasure, whose soft Magick oft beguiles Raw unexperienc'd Souls, And with smooth Flattery cajoles, Could ne'er ensnare thee with her Wiles, Or make thee Captive to her soothing Smiles. In vain that Pimp of Vice assay'd to please, In hope to draw thee to its rude Embrace. Thy Prudence still that Syren past Without being pinion'd to the Mast: All its Attempts were ineffectual found; Heaven fenc'd thy heart with its own Mound, And forc'd the Tempter still from that forbidden Ground. XXVII. The mad Capricio's of the doating Age Could ne'er in the same Frenzy thee engage; But mov'd thee rather with a generous Rage. Gallants, who their high Breeding prize, Known only by their Gallanture and Vice, Whose Talent is to court a fashionable Sin, And act some fine Transgression with a janty Meen, May by such Methods hope the Vogue to win. Let those gay Fops who deem Their Infamies Accomplishment, Grow scandalous to get Esteem; And by Disgrace strive to be eminent. Here thou disdainst the common Road, Nor wouldst by ought be wood To wear the vain Iniquities o'th' Mode. Vice with thy Practice did so disagree, Thou scarce couldst bear it in thy Theory. Thou didst such Ignorance 'bove Knowledge prize, And here to be unskill'd, is to be wise. Such the first Founders of our Blood, While yet untempted, stood Contented only to know Good. XXVIII. Vertue alone did guide thy Actions here, Thou by no other Card thy Life didst steer: No sly decoy would serve, To make thee from its rigid Dictates swerve, Thy Love ne'er thought her worse Because thou hadst so few Competitors. Thou couldst adore her when ador'd by none Content to be her Votary alone: When 'twas proscrib'd the unkind World And to blind Cells, and Grotto's hurld, When thought the Fantom of some crazy Brain, Fit for grave Anchorets to entertain, A thin Chimæra, whom dull Gown-Men frame To gull deluded Mortals with an empty Name. XXIX. Thou own'dst no Crimes that shun'd the Light, Whose Horror might thy Blood affright, And force it to its known Retreat. While the pale Cheeks do Penance in their White, And tell that Blushes are too weak to expiate: Thy Faults might all be on thy Forehead wore And the whole World thy Confessor. Conscience within still kept Assize, To punish and deter Impieties: That inbred Judg, such strict Inspection bore, So travers'd all thy Actions ore; Th' Eternal Judge could scarce do more: Those little Escapades of Vice, Which pass the Cognizance of most I'th' Crowd of following Sins forgot and lost, Could ne're its Sentence or Arraignment miss: Thou didst prevent the young desires of ill, And them in their first Motions kill: The very thoughts in others unconfin'd And lawless as the Wind, Thou couldst to Rule and Order bind. They durst not any stamp, but that of Vertue bear, And free from stain as thy most publick Actions were. Let wild Debauches hug their darling Vice And court no other Paradise, Till want of Power Bids 'em discard the stale Amour, And when disabled strength shall force A short Divorce, Miscall that weak forbearance Abstinence, Which wise Morality and better Sence Stiles but at best a sneaking Impotence. Thine far a Nobler Pitch did fly 'Twas all free choice, nought of Necessity. Thou didst that puny Soul disdain Whose half strain Vertue only can restrain; Nor wouldst that empty Being own Which springs from Negatives alone, But truly thoughst it always Vertues Skeleton. XXX. Nor didst thou those mean Spirits more approve, Who Vertue, only for its Dowry love, Unbrib'd thou didst her sterling self espouse: Nor wouldst a better Mistress choose. Thou couldst Affection to her bare Idæa pay The first that e'er caress'd her the Platonick way. To see her in her own Attractions drest Did all thy Love arrest, Nor lack'd there new Efforts to storm thy Brest. Thy generous Loyalty Would ne'er a Mercenary be, But chose to serve her still without a Livery. Yet wast thou not of Recompense debarr'd, But countedst Honesty its own Reward; Thou didst not wish a greater Bliss t' accrue, For to be good to thee was to be happy too, That secret Triumph of thy mind, Which always thou in doing well didst find, Were Heaven enough, were there no other Heaven design'd. XXXI. What Vertues few possess but by Retail In gross could thee their Owner call; They all did in thy single Circle fall. Thou wast a living System where were wrote All those high Morals which in Books are sought. Thy Practice did more Vertues share Than heretofore the learned Porch e'er knew, Or in the Stagyrites scant Ethics grew: Devout thou wast as holy Hermits are, Which share their time 'twixt Extasie and Prayer. Modest as Infant Roses in their bloom, Which in a Blush their Lives consume, So Chast, the Dead are only more, Who lie divorc'd from Objects, and from Power. So pure, that if blest Saints could be Taught Innocence, they'd gladly learn of thee. Thy Vertues height in Heaven alone could grow Nor to ought else would for Accession owe: It only now's more perfect than it was below. XXXII. Hence, tho' at once thy Soul liv'd here and there, Yet Heaven alone its Thoughts did share; It own'd no home, but in the active Sphere. Its Motions always did to that bright Center rowl, And seem'd t' inform thee only on Parole. Look how the Needle does to its dear North incline, As wer't not fixt 'twould to that Region climb; Or mark what hidden force Bids the Flame upwards take its course, And makes it with that Swiftness rise, The pagination of the source document has been followed. As if 'twere wing'd by th' Air thro' which it flies. Such a strong Vertue did thy Inclinations bend, And made 'em still to the blest Mansions tend. That mighty Slave whom the proud Victor's Rage Shut Pris'ner in a golden Cage, Condemn'd to glorious Vassalage, Ne'er long'd for dear Enlargement more, Nor his gay Bondage with less Patience bore, Than this great Spirit brook its tedious Stay, While fetter'd here in brittle Clay, And wish'd to disengage and fly away. It vext and chaf'd, and still desir'd to be Releas'd to the sweet Freedom of Eternity. XXXIII. Nor were its Wishes long unheard, Fate soon at its desire appear'd. And strait for an Assault prepar'd. A suddain and a swift Disease First on thy Heart Life's chiefest Fort does seize, And then on all the Suburb-vitals preys: Next it corrupts thy tainted Blood, And scatters Poyson thro' its purple Flood. Sharp Aches in thick Troops it sends, And Pain, which like a Rack the Nerves extends. Anguish through every Member flies, And all those inward Gemonies Whereby frail Flesh in Torture dies. All the staid Glories of thy Face, Where sprightly Youth lay checkt with manly Grace, Are now impair'd, And quite by the rude hand of Sickness mar'd. Thy Body where due Symmetry In just proportions once did lie, Now hardly could be known, Its very Figure out of Fashion grown; And should thy Soul to its old Seat return, And Life once more adjourn, 'Twould stand amaz'd to see its alter'd Frame, And doubt (almost) whether its own Carcass were the same. XXXIV. And here thy Sickness does new matter raise Both for thy Vertue and our Praise; 'Twas here thy Picture look'd most neat, When deep'st in Shades 'twas set. Thy Vertues only thus could fairer be Advantag'd by the Foil of Misery. Thy Soul which hasten'd now to be enlarg'd, And of its grosser Load discharg'd, Began to act above its wonted rate, And gave a Prælude of its next unbody'd State. So dying Tapers near their Fall, When their own Lustre lights their Funeral, Contract their Strength into one brighter Fire, And in that Blaze triumphantly expire. So the bright Globe that rules the Skies, Tho' he guild Heav'n with a glorious Rise, Reserves his choicest Beams to grace his Set; And then he looks most great, And then in greatest Splendor dies. [XXXV.] Thou sharpest pains didst with that Courage bear, And still thy Looks so unconcern'd didst wear: Beholders seem'd more indispos'd than thee; For they were sick in Effigie. Like some well-fashion'd Arch thy Patience stood, And purchas'd Firmness from its greater Load. Those Shapes of Torture, which to view in Paint Would make another faint; Thou could'st endure in true Reality, And feel what some could hardly bear to see. Those Indians who their Kings by Torture chose, Subjecting all the Royal Issue to that Test Could ne'er thy Sway refuse, If he deserves to reign that suffers best. Had those fierce Savages thy Patience view'd, Thou'dst claim'd their Choice alone They with a Crown had paid thy Fortitude, And turn'd thy Death bed to a Throne [XXXVI.] All those Heroick Pieties, Whose Zeal to Truth made them its Sacrifice: Those nobler Scævola's, whose holy Rage Did their whole selves in cruel Flames engage, Who did amidst their Force unmov'd appear, As if those Fires but lambent were; Or they had found their Empyreum there. Might these repeat again their Days beneath, They'd seen their Fates out-acted by a natural Death, And each of them to thee resign his Wreath. In spite of Weakness and harsh Destiny, To relish Torment, and enjoy a Misery: So to caress a Doom, As make its Sufferings Delights become: So to triumph o'er Sense and thy Disease, As amongst Pains to revel in soft Ease: These wonders did thy Vertues worth enhance, And Sickness to dry Martyrdom advance. [XXXVII.] Yet could not all these Miracles stern Fate avert, Or make't withold the Dart. Only she paus'd a while with Wonder strook, A while she doubted if that Destiny was thine, And turned o'er again the dreadful Book, And hop'd she had mistook; And wish'd she might have cut another Line. But dire Necessity Soon cry'd 'twas thee, And bad her give the fatal Blow. Strait she obeys, and strait the vital Powers grow Too weak to grapple with a stronger Foe, And now the feeble Strife forgo. Life's sap'd Foundation every Moment sinks, And every Breath to lesser compass shrinks; Last panting Gasps grow weaker each Rebound, Like the faint Tremblings of a dying Sound: And doubtful Twilight hovers o'er the Light, Ready to usher in Eternal Night. [XXXVIII.] Yet here thy Courage taught thee to out-brave All the slight Horrors of the Grave: Pale Death's Arrest Ne'er shock'd thy Breast; Nor could it in the dreadfulst Figure drest. That ugly Skeleton may guilty Spirits daunt, When the dire Ghosts of Crimes departed haunt, Arm'd with bold Innocence thou couldst that Mormo dare, And on the bare-fac'd King of Terrors stare, As free from all Effects as from the Cause of Fear. Thy Soul so willing from thy Body went, As if both parted by Consent. No Murmur, no Complaining, no Delay, Only a Sigh, a Groan, and so away. Death seem'd to glide with Pleasure in, As if in this Sense too 't had lost her Sting. Like some well-acted Comedy Life swiftly past, And ended just so still and sweet at last. Thou, like its Actors, seem'dst in borrow'd Habit here beneath, And couldst, as easily As they do that, put off Mortality. Thou breathedst out thy Soul as free as common Breath, As unconcern'd as they are in a feigned Death. [XXXIX.] Go happy Soul, ascend the joyful Sky, Joyful to shine with thy bright Company: Go mount the spangled Sphere, And make it brighter by another Star: Yet stop not there, till thou advance yet higher, Till thou art swallow'd quite In the vast unexhausted Ocean of Delight: Delight which there alone in its true Essence is, Where Saints keep an eternal Carnival of Bliss: Where the Regalio's of refined Joy, Which fill, but never cloy. Where Pleasures ever growing, ever new, Immortal as thy self, and boundless too. There may'st thou learned by Compendium grow; For which in vain below We so much time, and so much pains bestow. There may'st thou all Idæa's see, All wonders which in Knowledge be In that fair beatifick mirror of the Deity. [XL.] Mean while thy Body mourns in its own Dust, And puts on Sables for its tender Trust. Tho' dead, it yet retains some untoucht Grace, Wherein we may thy Soul's fair Foot-steps trace; Which no Disease can frighten from its wonted place: E'en its Deformities do thee become, And only serve to consecrate thy Doom. Those marks of Death which did its Surface stain Now hallow, not profane. Each Spot does to a Ruby turn; What soil'd but now, would now adorn. Those Asterisks plac'd in the Margin of thy Skin Point out the nobler Soul that dwelt within: Thy lesser, like the greater World appears All over bright, all over stuck with Stars. So Indian Luxury when it would be trim, Hangs Pearls on every Limb. Thus amongst ancient Picts Nobility In Blemishes did lie; Each by his Spots more honourable grew, And from their Store a greater Value drew: Their Kings were known by th' Royal Stains they bore, And in their Skins their Ermin wore. [LXI.] Thy Blood where Death triumph'd in greatest State, Whose Purple seem'd the Badge of Tyrant-Fate, And all thy Body o'er Its ruling Colours bore: That which infected with the noxious Ill But lately help'd to kill, Whose Circulation fatal grew. And thro' each part a swifter Ruin threw. Now conscious, its own Murther would arraign, And throngs to sally out at every Vein. Each Drop a redder than its native Dye puts on, As if in its own Blushes 'twould its Guilt atone. A sacred Rubric does thy Carcass paint, And Death in every Member writes thee Saint. So Phœbus cloaths his dying Rays each Night, And blushes he can live no longer to give Light. [LXII.] Let Fools, whose dying Fame requires to have Like their own Carcasses a Grave, Let them with vain Expence adorn Some costly Urn, Which shortly, like themselves, to Dust shall turn. Here lacks no Carian Sepulchre, Which Ruin shall e'er long in its own Tomb interr. No fond Ægyptian Fabric built so high As if 'twould climb the Sky, And thence reach Immortality. Thy Vertues shall embalm thy Name, And make it lasting as the Breath of Fame. When frailer Brass Shall moulder by a quick Decrease; When brittle Marble shall decay, And to the Jaws of Time become a Prey. Thy Praise shall live, when Graves shall buried lie, Till Time it self shall die, And yield its triple Empire to Eternity. To the Memory of that worthy Gentleman, Mr. Harman Atwood. PINDARIQUE. I. No, I'll no more repine at Destiny, Now we poor common Mortals are content to die. When thee, blest Saint, we cold and breathless see, Thee, who if ought that's great and brave, Ought that is excellent might save, Hadst justly claim'd Exemption from the Grave, And cancell'd the black irreversible Decree. Thou didst alone such Worth, such Goodness share As well deserv'd to be immortal here; Deserve a Life as lasting as the Fame thou art to wear. At least, why went thy Soul without its Mate? Why did they not together undivided go? So went (we're told) the fam'd Illustrious Two. (Nor could they greater Merits shew, Altho' the best of Patriarchs that, And this the best of Prophets was) Heav'n did alive the blessed Pair translate; Alive they launch'd into Life's boundless Happiness, And never past Death's Straights and narrow Seas; Ne'er enter'd the dark gloomy Thorowfare of Fate. II. Long time had the Profession under Scandal lain, And felt a general tho' unjust Disdain, An upright Lawyer Contradiction seem'd, And was at least a Prodigy esteem'd. If one perhaps did in an Age appear, He was recorded like some Blazing Star; And Statues were erected to the wondrous Man, As heretofore to the strange honest Publican. To thee the numerous Calling all its thanks should give, To thee who couldst alone its lost Repute retrieve. Thou the vast wide extremes didst reconcile, The first, almost, e'er taught it was not to beguile. To each thou didst distribute Right so equally, Ev'n Justice might her self correct her Scales by thee. And none did now regret, Her once bewail'd Retreat, Since all enjoy'd her better Deputy. Henceforth succeeding Time shall bear in mind, And Chronicle the best of all the kind: The best e'er since the man that gave Our suffering God a Grave; (That God who living no Abode could find, Tho' he the World had made, and was to save) Embalming him, he did embalm his Memory, And make it from Corruption free: Those Odors kindly lent perfum'd the Breath of Fame, And fixt a lasting Fragrancy upon his Name; And rais'd it with his Saviour to an Immortality. III. Hence the stale musty Paradox of equal Souls, That ancient vulgar Error of the Schools, Avow'd by dull Philosophers and thinking Fool. Here might they find their feeble Arguments o'erthrown: Here might the grave Disputers find Themselves all baffl'd by a single Mind, And see one vastly larger than their own, Tho' all of theirs were mixt in one. A Soul as great as e'er vouchsaf'd to be Inhabiter in low Mortality; As e'er th' Almighty Artist labour'd to infuse, Thro' all his Mint he did the brightest chuse; With his own Image stampt it fair, And bid it ever the Divine Impression wear; And so it did, so pure, so well, We hardly could believe him of the Race that fell: So spotless still, and still so good, As if it never lodg'd in Flesh and Blood. Hence conscious too, how high, how nobly born: It never did reproach its Birth, By valuing ought of base or meaner worth, But look'd on earthly Grandeur with Contempt and Scorn. IV. Like his All-great Creator, who Can only by diffusing greater grow: He made his chiefest Glory to communicate, And chose the fairest Attribute to imitate. So kind, so generous, and so free, As if he only liv'd in Courtesie. To be unhappy did his Pity claim, Only to want it did deserve the same: Nor lack'd there other Rhetorick than Innocence and Misery. His unconfin'd unhoarded Store Was still the vast Exchequer of the poor; And whatsoe'er in pious Acts went out He did in his own Inventory put: For well the wise and prudent Banker knew His Gracious Sovereign above would all repay, And all th' expences of his Charity defray; And so he did, both Principal and Interest too, And he by holy Prodigality more wealthy grew. Such, and so universal is the Influence Which the kind bounteous Sun does here dispense: With an unwearied indefatigable Race, He travels round the World each day, And visits all Mankind, and every place, And scatters Light and Blessings all the way. Tho' he each hour new Beams expend, Yet does he not like wasting Tapers spend. Tho' he ten thousand years disburse in Light, The boundless Stock can never be exhausted quite. V. Nor was his Bounty stinted or design'd, As theirs who only partially are kind; Or give where they Return expect to find: But like his Soul, its fair Original: 'Twas all in all, And all in every part, Silent as his Devotion, open as his Heart. Brib'd with the Pleasure to oblige and gratifie, As Air and Sunshine he dispos'd his Kindness free, Yet scorn'd Requitals, and worse hated Flattery, And all obsequious Pomp of vain formality. Thus the Almighty Bounty does bestow Its Favors on our undeserving Race below; Confer'd on all its loyal Votaries; Confer'd alike on its rebellious Enemies. To it alone our All we owe, All that we are and are to be, Each Art and Science to its Liberality, And this same trifling jingling thing call'd Poetry. Yet the great Donor does no costly Gratitude require, No Charge of Sacrifice desire; Nor are w' expensive Hecatombs to raise, As heretofore, To make his Altars float with reeking Gore. A small Return the mighty Debt and Duty pays, Ev'n the cheap humble Off'ring of worthless Thanks and Praise. VI. But how, blest Saint, shall I thy numerous Vertues summ, If one or two take up this room? To what vast Bulk must the full Audit come? As that bold Hand that drew the fairest Deity, Had many naked Beauties by, And took from each a several Grace, and Air, and Line, And all in one Epitome did joyn To paint his bright Immortal in a Form Divine: So must I do to frame thy Character. I'll think whatever Men can good and lovely call, And then abridge it all, And crowd, and mix the various Idæas there; And yet at last of a just Praise despair. Whatever ancient Worthies boast, Which made themselves and Poets their Describers great, From whence old Zeal did Gods and Shrines create; Thou hadst thy self alone engrost, And all their scatter'd Glories in thy Soul did meet: And future Ages, when they eminent Vertues see, (If any after thee Dare the Pretence of Vertue own, Without the Fear of being far out-done) Shall count 'em all but Legacy, Which from the Strength of thy Example flow, And thy fair Copy in a less correct Edition show. VII. Religion over all did a just Conduct claim, No false Religion which from Custom came, Which to its Font and Country only ow'd its Name: No Issue of devout and zealous Ignorance, Or the more dull Effect of Chance; But 'twas a firm well-grounded Piety, That knew all that it did believe, and why; And for the glorious Cause durst die, And durst out-suffer ancient Martyrology. So knit and interwoven with its being so, Most thought it did not from his Duty, but his Nature flow. Exalted far above the vain small Attacks of Wit, And all that vile gay lewd Buffoons can bring, Who try by little Railleries to ruin it; And jeer't into an unreguarded poor defenceless thing. The Men of Sence who in Confederacy join, To damn Religion had they view'd but thine, They'd have confest it pure, confest it all divine, And free from all Pretences of Imposture or Design. Pow'rful enough to counter-act lewd Poets and the Stage, And Proselyte as fast as they debauch the Age; So good, it might alone a guilty condemn'd World reprieve, Should a destroying Angel stand With brandish'd Thunder in his Hand, Ready the bidden Stroke to give; Or a new Deluge threaten this and every Land. VIII. Religion once a quiet and a peaceful Name, Which all the Epithets of Gentleness did claim, Late prov'd the Source of Faction and intestine Jars: Like the Fair teeming Hebrew, she Did travel with a wrangling Progeny, And harbor'd in her Bowels Fewds and Civil Wars. Surly, uncomplaisant, and rough she grew, And of a soft and easie Mistress turn'd a Shrew. Passion and Anger went for marks of Grace, And looks deform'd and sullen sanctifyed a Face. Thou first its meek and primitive Temper didst restore, First shew'dst how men were pious heretofore: The gaul-less Dove, which otherwhere could find no Rest, Early retreated to its Ark, thy Breast, And straight the swelling Waves decreast And straight tempestuous Passions ceast, Like Winds and Storms where some fair Halcyon builds her Nest. No overheating Zeal did thee inspire, But 'twas a kindly gentle Fire, To warm, but not devour, And only did refine, and make more pure: Such is that Fire that makes thy present blest Abode The Residence and Palace of our God. And such was that bright unconsuming Flame, So mild, so harmless and so tame, Which heretofore ith' Bush to Moses came: At first the Vision did the wondring Prophet scare, But when the voice had check'd his needless Fear He bow'd and worshipp'd and confest the Deity was there. IX. Hail Saint Triumphant! hail Heav'ns happy Guest. Hail new Inhabitant amongst the blest! Methinks I see kind Spirits in convoy meet. And with loud Welcomes thy Arrival greet. Who, could they grieve, would go with Grief away To see a Soul more white, more pure than they: By them thou'rt led on high To the vast glorious Apartment of the Deity. Where circulating Pleasures make an endless Round To which scant Time or Measure sets no Bound, Perfect unmixt Delights without Alloy, And whatsoe'er does earthly Bliss annoy, Which oft does in Fruition Pall and oft'ner Cloy: Where being is no longer Life but Extasie, But one long Transport of unutterable Joy. A Joy above the boldest Flights of daring verse, And all a Muse unglorifyed can fancy or rehearse: There happy Thou From Troubles and the bustling toil of Business free, From noise and tracas of tumultuous Life below, Enjoy'st the still and calm Vacation of Eternity.</field>
