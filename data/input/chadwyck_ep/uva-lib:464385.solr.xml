      <field name="fulltext">CALEDONIAS COVENANT A PANEGYRICK TO THE WORLDE. Heauens listen, Earth beare Witnes, Time recorde My heauy Grieffe, and Speedy help affoard, My soule half sunk in sad dispaire doth faint, I scarce haue breath to sighe out my Complaint: My moistned Eyes with weeping almost blinde And parched tounge whose Cries no pittie finde Now worne with woaes and wroungs without reliefe At last giue over hope and yeeld to Griefe. Yet that the world may know my wretched Cace, And where Tales runne Trueth may at length take place, To all good Christians, members of that head Informations and Protestations.Whose Cause, and Churches priviledge I plead, And in whose presence heere I doe protest To haue no other ayme but peace and rest, Relligions puritie, the Gospels light To shine agayne through Superstitions night, I heere rip up my brest that euery Eye Not bleard with Passion, may my heart descrie, And all unpartiall Eares may rightlie ponder The load of wroungs which I lie groaning under. The Reformation.When from the dauning of the Gospels day, The sunne of Trueth (long sett) did first display His glorious beames, and gild the glowing East; The light so dazel'd Babels blindfold beast That like a roaring Lion mad hee ranne. And cast false clouds of scorne t'ecclypst againe: Yea all that worship'd it with humbled heart Of his fierce rage did finde the fierie smart, The darkned dens of Ignorancé, where sat The Monasteries. Blind Heresie and bowd to knew not what, To be discouered spewd there spite at heauen For feare there dwellars should from thenc be driven: Rome ragd to see a Corner of the worlde Where from his thron his triple Croun was hurl'd, And I was then with candle, book, and bell By Antichrist condemnd to lowest hell; The blessed martyrs that his threats withstood And seald the glorious gospell with ther blood Wishart, and others burnt by Cardinal Betcune. With heauenly courage and with constant hop Preachd Christ aboue the pardons of the pop, For which calld Hereticks, ther liues did pay: And burnd to ashes drenchd in blood, did lay The Churches firme foundation, which by time Did to a fayre and beauteous temple climbe, When God set open the eyes of Prince and peeres And made the Gospells trumpet pierce the eares Of deafned Idoll-worshippers, and call To mercy penitent beleeuers all, The mist clear'd up, the masse did vanishe quite At the faire sunshine of the Gospels light, Then ignorance and superstition fled To hell agayne where they were hathd and bred, Proud priests, that on the silly people prey'd The Cardinall. once killed all his sectators vanished. Whil the crosse staffe abou the scepter sweyd, There knauerie seen did melt away for shame And simple shepheards in there places came, That was my golden age, then loue and feare Of God throughout all Scotland did appeare, My prince a patterne of true pietie, King IAMES made the couenant and commanded all the contrye to signe it.That after ages his great zeal might see, To Gods pure worship, with a heart vpright His subjects and himselfe did fast vnite By couenant subscriv'd and sworne with God On highest payne of heaviest plague and rod, All superstition, poperie, heresies, Episcopall authoritie, Hierarchyes, Willworship and what ere was then rejected As hurtfull, or which had the church infected: With heart and hand with life estate and might Still to withstand while they could stand and fight. No prelat then presum'd before another; Nor calld him lord whom office made his brother. A Bishop and a bugge beare were all one, And meerly names there lordships were not knoune, Vntill the time great JAMES, our Salomon Changd Scotland England into ALBION. Q. Elzabeth.ELIZA dead, Sabrina Trent and Thames, Fell prostrate at the feet of royale JAMES, There peeres in pompe and state louwe homadge made There prelates of the church did stile him head: And put themselues next him that rank to holde In Parlament and State they had of olde, The gracious prince was pleasd with what hee found, Nor did hee change the least thing being cround, But for to make both one as was his ayme The vnion.Hee laboured to make them both the same, The greattest ods was in the Church indeed Which to make euen did mee much mischeeffe breed, Aspiring priests pufft up with vaine ambition, Tolde Him this Church was of a base Condition, When euery priuat preacher durst reproue The Prince Himselfe, whom God had sett aboue The reach of censure, and't would better sute The Kingdomes honor, if the King would do't To settle Bishops, who should haue the Charge Of Spirituall things, would Hee there power enlarge And authorise Them, with his Royalle ayde; Both Prince and priest should be feard and obeyd: Bishops abstained. Then first began my miserie alace! And pride did from the Church Deuotion chase, A jealous Aemulation streight way filled My newmade Bishops breasts, who all aspired To be as great as Romes great beast in pouer: And gouerne euerie state, for all wer lower. The mitre, thoughe it brought no Monarchie, Yet was an Enseigne of there Hierarchie. All publicque charges of the croune and State Meluìn and others who were banished. The first scots [illeg.] Consecrated in England took there cathes to be conforme to the Church of England, mutatis mutandis They eyther did posses or aymed at, Which made my Zealous Pastours to crie out Against those wolfes who closely went about, To slave the church to there Imperious will, Who had combind with England; to fulfill All there desires to compasse there designes: Wherfor they banishd all my best diuynes, Emprisond, silencd, whilst might daunted right, And Souueraignitie for them did fight. The neighbour world and churche did shelter giue, When persecution would nott lett them liue In peace at home, Thus clad with Royale armes, Transported from themselues, bewitchd with Charmes Of Greatnes; and that highe Triumphant state In which the Neighbour Englands Prelates sate, (Though great the disproportion was in all As from the shrub unto the Cedar tall,) My pettie priests would all be Popes at oncé And (Basans bulls) into there bulles denounce Destruction, to all such as durst withstand Th'usurped pouer of Prelates in Command, At the last comming of K. Iames into Scotland. An. 1617.The first assault they gaue was all in vaine Ther growing pride was soon repulsd againe, Though it had no intention but to bring Conformitie in Church and everie thing That England had retaynd, reforming first Those errours which Rome fostered had and nurst. My people wer mor sharpely gone to worke And had found out what euer hid did lurke Into the deapest Corners most obscure; And what could not the light and touch endure As false was cast away; The King surceast In wise foresight and would not haué it prest Vpon mee more, when hee the danger sawe Which such an innovation on could drawe, Heauen call'd him hence vnto a greater Croune And in his Chayre our Mightie CHARLES sate doune, Those Sycophants empoysoning his Eares, (While thrusting in betuix Him and His Peeres) Ubi nullus Episcopus ubi nullus Rex.A damned Maxime mad Him vnderstand No Bischop, then no King into a land: And which was worse, conspiring with the whoore Whose foule embraces wee cast off before Assisted with the Prime of Englands priests They fram'd a seruice booke, my soule detests: Which I should first receaue and make the way The scottish seruische booke. The soules of all great Brittayne to betray, For Ireland as a page must followe still And subject be vnto her conquerours will. That stood against my stomacke I confesse As't was against the treuth I did professe. God rousd my conscience and did call mee up The course of poperie in the source to stop, And call'd to mynd the couenant I hade made The couenant renevved. With him, when I from slauerie first was fred, Never to return to Rome. my soule did bleed When I reneend that oath, my teares did plead For pittie at my prince, and I besought No stranger rites might in my church be brought. But all in vaine, what ever I beggd' or pray'd I was a traytour and a rebell made, The proclamations. That durst oppose whateuer was found good By those who in the church did what they wold, All my petitions were cast back with scorne, And ere my prince had seen them, rent and torne; Great armyes raisd by sea and land, to fall At once upon mee, neither durst I call To God or man for helpe, and what I did Was treason still and misinterpreted. The strongest forts I had for my defence For my destruction arm'd, to giue offence Edenburgh and Dunbartan. And make mee guiltie, were with strangers clad, All warrelike engines for invasion made Against mee drest, yet did I not forbeare, To praye and sue to those that would not heare, When all that I could thinke was try'd invaine, And I had still my labour for my payne. Danger did threaten and at last drew neare Duns leager.Then in myne oun defenc I arm'd with feare, To saue my life, as nature doth allowe, Nor did I passe my bounds as all men knowe, Mine enemyes amazed to see mee stand Vpon my border still with sword in hand, When they could not engadge mee into blood And found that I but for my freedome stood Pacification at beruick.Of church and contrye, vnder show of peace Betrayd mee falsely with a faynd embrace: Whilst what was promisd was not truely meant. Nor durst I craue, for feare of discontent. There maine intentions were but to beguile My rashe beleeffe: and foolle mee for a while, Till they could take new breath and strength againe When I had layd doune armes: and fall amayne With all there might upon mee vnaware, For which, afresh they Parlaments prepare In England and IrelandWith monneys to suplie ther mischeefs want, And ask farre more then free consent will graunt. To neighbour princes I am pourtrayd blacke My cause and mee both hatefull for to make, Newe thunders forg'd, the King embark'd againe In priests revenge, till Scotland all be slayne And Laud be pope of Brittaine, t'was then time For mee (whoes zeall to Gods house was a crime) To looke about, and if I could prevent The threatning Tempest which was imminent. God great and iust who tries the heart and reins Entry into England. Is witnesse, if to warre my heart enclynes, Or if I meane to England harme at all: But only banishd Iustice to recall, And haue Relligion sett al Libertie, A Captiue handmaid late to Tyrannie, Tvved sawe my Teares and knowes I did not pass His streame to prey or spoyle, but that I was Constraynd in suertye to march on my way And seeke redresse, for what I took to pay: The reasons and cariadge of it. To offer no man wrounge but freindly ayde. Nor ever meant my neighbours to invade: The want of justice, breach of promise past, Relligion slau'd, and vtter ruyne last In such extreames made need a law to mee; To seeke my safetie and her libertie. My first encounter when I past the Tine What blood was spilt it was no fault of myne, And heavens are witnes I did never intend In quiet passadge England to offend, But with all loue and friendship joyntlie goe In Common cause to find the Common foe, And to remoue the wicked from the King Whose malice seekes on both a scourge to bring, For thoughe I spoke shee thought no lesse then I: But durst not shaik the Church authoritie: And rather choos'd in silence for to suffer Then have her nose and eares to be cutt off her, As many had bein seru'd by th' Highe C?mission. Neare cousine to the Spanishe Inquisition. Newcastle found no force but sawe us freynds, BalcanquellSo Durrham did, (whose Deanes vnluckie ends A prouidence prevented, and will pay His lies with there rewarde some happie day) And when command to march no further, came, In hope of hearing I obeyd the same, Till Englands Parlament should weell considder The justice of that cause that brought mee hither, And well examine if I haue done well; Or with hostilitie should mee expell. That sacred senate hauing leaue to speake, And of all state abuse the source to seeke: The L. Deputie of Irland and the Archbishop of CanterburyFound in her bosome and about the Prince Those vipers whom highe treason doth convince. Those factious firebrands that so falslie deale With God and King in church and common weale Shall of ther merite finde the earned meede; Farre better they should then tuo nations bleed. Those that haue'scapt by flight to forraine lands; A power shall reach which ouer all commands, And giue the just reward as it is due The Scottish Bishops and other corrupted Statesmen, Ther's no protection when the heauens pursue. Those monsters vnto whom I once lent birth Become my bane, a scandale to the earth; Though now at court a time they shelterd bee With guilty conscience for there wroungs to mee: A day will come I hope when they shall finde There mischeeffs merite in the highest kinde. Will CHARLES but leaue them to my Parlament Ther they shall haue deserued punishment, So shall great Brittaine prosper, and his raigne Bring to this isle the golden age agayne. But ah! my feares forbid to hope so much: The Spanyshe faction. The subtile Spanishe serpents craft is such, That all our aymes houeuer well begunne Euen in the budd are presently vndone. That wretched golde, that farre fetchd Indian dross All our attempts and good designes doth cross. Corruption is a court disease become, And takes no doctors counsaill but from Rome; Which neuer whollie cures the lame or blinde But alwayes there remaynes some dreggs behinde Which like the fire in ashes hid breaks out And of a sudden kindleth all about: Though for a time it lye as close as dead I feare that foule infection forth shall spread: Vnles it please that God by whom kings raigne To giue vs warre against both Rome and Spaine: Which wee haue now iust cause to vndertake For CHARLES his sister and his nephewes sake. Q. of Boheme. But wee must wait with prayers on our God Who'il giue us peace at home and warre abroad. Heer like the hart that panteth for the spring, My soule awaits good tidings from my King. My prayers are the weapons which I use That heaven will in his sacred breast infuse True wisedome, that his reasons eyes may sie, Through all the clouds of spyte and flatterie My upright heart, the churches sore oppression, And scan the trueth of euery mouths confession, Reward the good, rebuke the reprobate, Remeed the greevances of church and state, Maintayne the Gospell in its puritie, Remoue false Doctors, root out heresie, Lay doun good lawes, doe justice vnto all, Curb vice, without respect in great and small, That those whom God hath joyn'd, may vnder him And his, liue happye to the end of Time. This is my heartye wishe and prayer still: Which heauen will heare I hope and soone fulfill, To send mee home a song of joye to sing And pray for fayths defender, CHARLES the King.
