      <field name="fulltext">A PIL for Pork-Eaters, &amp;c. Heavens! Are we such a servile Nation grown, Beneath our Ancestors so vastly thrown, That every English scribling Tool o' late, (Base Miscreants, and Vermin of the State, Hir'd by the Mob, and licens'd now to prate) Dares thus arraign our Justice and our Laws, And make Three Villains Lives a Nation's Cause? Villains! whose Crimes to such a Pitch were flown, And blackest Guilt so ripe for Vengeance grown, That Heaven it self no longer cou'd forbear, Nor cou'd they shun their just Destruction here, Where Lenity and Clemency abounds, And rigid Laws are kept within their Mounds. Had we pack't Juries, such damn'd hellish Things, By which you decently have Murder'd Kings? What England says, cou'd hardly be withstood; Nor cou'd we clear our selves from guiltless Blood. No, no; Here were no Juries of old Bradshaw's Spawn, Who for Revenge, their Necks and Souls would pawn; But strongest Proofs, from solid Grounds were drawn; A Heap of Proofs; nay Providence concurr'd, To shew the Wretches were by Heav'n abhorr'd: A long Detail of which were needless here, They're so well known, and buzz'd in every Ear: So Evident they were, so Clear and Plain, Our Judges still untainted shall remain, And none but spiteful English Rogues complain. But England's Insolent and Proud like Hell, Whose saucie Boldness nought but Blows can quell, Dare now our Laws and Sentences canvass, And Censures on our justest Pleadings pass; Tho' many pregnant Instances declare, What's scarce allow'd for bare Presumptions here, Wou'd serve to hang a Hundred Scotsmen there. But if by Providence a Tarr is driven Upon our Coasts, and here a Villain proven, Let him be English, and the Devil to boot, He dies a white and spotless Saint no doubt: Our Magistrates and Church-men are abus'd, And we as Thieves and Murderers accus'd: For Drummond is at Madagascar still, So say your Post-Knights, credit them who will. But had we here Ten thousand Pounds laid down, For each your Squires, who swear for Half-a-Crown, Then England for its Treachery shou'd mourn, Be forc'd to fawn, and truckle in its Turn: Scots Pedlars you no longer durst upbraid, And DARIEN shou'd with Interest be repaid. For 'tis not Courage, but the Cash we want, To make Proud England her base Threats recant. May England for its Luxury be damn'd, Base Epicures with Pork and Pudding cramm'd: Let Surfeits in thy Families prevail, Till each disgorge a Soul at every Meal; And Gormandizing be thy chiefest Trade, Till all thy Sons of Luxury be dead: Of thy great Chiefs how few wou'd there remain; To Conquer you, would be no Valour then. And London, thou curs'd Sodom o' the Isle, Who drains our Wealth, and laughs at us the while; Not these Four guilty Cities o' the Plain, On which Just Heav'n did Fire and Brimstone rain, Cou'd match thy nameless Crimes, who now art grown Hell's great Original, thy self alone. And thou curs'd Villain, who dar'st thus reproach Our State, and such base lying Scandals broach: Scandals for which thy Blood must be the Price, Tho' far too mean and base a Sacrifice: Mayest thou in monumental Chains be hung, And Carbonado'd be thy sland'ring Tongue; And when thy silent Ghost shall wandring go, Abandon'd to the gloomy Shades below; May it return, and these Credentials bring, That Green and Madder did most justly swing. Damn'd be that Hackney-pen that durst traduce Great H?n, our Noblest Patriot, thus: 'Gainst this Brave Patriot thou hast belch'd thy worst, Ev'n what thy boldest Heroes never durst. Thy Country such a Patriot ne're cou'd match, Whom no Preferments, nor no Baits can catch: Whate're the Court cou'd bid, this Prince withstood, He sweats and toils to do his Country good: For what are these to such a Mind as His, Whom Heav'n hath taught what truest Honour is? Whose Country's Int'rest, now almost undone, He still pursues, regardless of His own. May Heav'n with Success Crown His brave Design, And may no English Plots His Counsels undermine; May they when hatch't, abortive still remain, That we may yet be Happy once again. Curs'd be the Day (for then we were betray'd) When first our King the English Scepter sway'd. Since when such fatal Slav'ry we have bore, As never State nor Kingdom did before: From neighbouring States we no Assistance crav'd; We scorn'd by Foreign Yokes to be enslav'd; Had Wealth at Home, Alliances Abroad; Yea of our Friendship France it self was proud; Each Scot was brave, with Noble Courage fir'd; Our Court Polite, and every where admir'd. Thus from a Nation full of Power and Fame, We're dwindl'd to a Thing, scarce worth a Name, But shall we still be so! why sure we shan't, And England for her Mischief may repent: Yea my Prophetick Stars do tell me sure, That Scotland for Her Wrongs shall find a Cure. Ungenerous England! at this savage Rate, Still to abuse a free and neighbouring State! Why are we thus so mnch despis'd and scorn'd, As if we were they Tributaries turn'd? Or is it true, what Mungrel Atwood says, That by a Chain of long Dependencies, We are born Vassals to the English Crown, And that we therefore ought to be run down? If so, then let Us tamely bear Our Wrongs, With unperforming Swords, and silent Tongues: Yea, let Us all Our Just Resentments hide, And calmly truckle to your Hellish Pride. Forbid it Heaven! let's boldly claim our Right; Let England Bully, but let Scotland Fight: And let another Bannockburn redress, Too long endur'd Affronts and Grievances: Our Country, now oppress'd, shall then produce Hero's, like Douglas, Wallace and the BRUCE, Who England's Insolencies dare chastise, When Scotland's Liberties shall be the Prize. BRUCE with scarce Twenty thousand durst oppose A Hundred thousand saucy English Foes; Who's daring General, had sworn to bring Our Prince alive to his Proud English King: He marches straight, with many a threatning Boast, And meets our Prince, but found him to his Cost. The brave enraged BRUCE struck such a Blow, As almost cleft the haughty Slave in two: Then valiant Scots with Fury did advance, And Death triumphing, sat on every Lance; While glittering Swords, like Lightning from the Sky, Made all their scatter'd Troops with Horror fly. Great was the Success of that Glorious Day, When Fifty thousand English fell a Prey To greedy Death, who glutted, now gave o're, While Scotland's Fields o'reflow'd with English Gore. Thus did our Great Forefathers purchase Fame: And dare not We, their Off-spring, do the same? No, no, (says England) this you dare not do; Ye are our Slaves, and must continue so: But if in Peace you are inclin'd to live, Upon such Terms as we think fit to give,— Well! what are these?—Here England cuts you short, And tells you, you're but Pensioners at Court; And if we have but Gold enough in Store, Check to your, King we bar your Successor. Scotland remove the Check, or you in vain Strive to be free from your Inglorious Chafn, Unless you from this cursed Gold abstain; But separate from the Rooks, if you be wise, And their alluring Baits, with Scorn despise. Let us no more be bubbl'd and abus'd, Nor with their Shamms of Union more amus'd; 'Tis nothing but a treacherous Decoy, To bring us to their Measures, then destroy The Rights and Just Pretences of our Crown, And jeer and laugh at us when they have done. To Prophecy, tho' I have no Pretence, Yet I'll adventure to Divine for once; When Swans grow Black, and Ravens shall grow White Proud England then with Scotland shall unite; Unless we purge 'em with some warlike Pills, And tame their Insolence against their Wills. Then to our Aid let's call our Forces strait, Who gave to England such Renown of late; The English were the Conquerors proclaim'd, While injur'd Scots were to Oblivion damn'd: Yet had not Orkney and our Troops been there, Who in these Victories claim such a Share; Few Trophies then to England had been brought, Nor Schellenberg nor Blenheim, so well fought. Let's then begin, dare to be Wise and Brave; Let us unite, and Heaven's Protection crave, And manage well that Little which we have: Less than that Little, which doth yet remain, May chance to bring us, what we've lost, again. Let no brib'd fawning Parasite be here, Who cheats his Country to enrich his Heir; Be each a S?n full of Generous Fire, And may his Genius every Breast inspire; A Genius past the Reach of English Gold, Great and refin'd, cast in no common Mould: Were all thy Peers, O Scotland! such as he, It were impossible to Conquer thee. But let our Chiefs all factious Broils oppose, And join together in our common Cause. Insulting England to her Cost shall know, What Brave united Scotsmen then can do, When our best Troops are at thy Borders rang'd, Then CALEDONIA's Wrongs shall be reveng'd: Our Highlanders thy City-walls shall greet, And Gillicrankies rifle Lombard-street. Then shall your City-Cuckolds keep a Pother, And in such Jargon talk to one another: So ho, Jack, Tom, Gadzooks what shall we do? The Scotch in earnest are upon us now; Zounds, Harie, there's no Help, but buckle to: We now must treat, and with the Scotch agree; For as they're Valiant, so they must be free: We must our foolish Shamms and Plots give o're, The Scotch we find, will be oppress'd no more. FINIS. ROBERT the Third, King of SCOTLAND, HIS ANSWER to a Summons sent Him by Henry the Fourth of England, to do Homage for the Crown of Scotland. During the Reign of the Royal Robert, The Second of the good Stewart; Henrie of England the feard King To Scotland sent and ask'd this thing; To spier at Robert, “Why he not made “Him Homage for his Lands braid, “For why, he ought of Heretage, “At London to do him Homage: “And that in Right of Brutus King, “Who had Ingland in governing. “Why then caused he through his Guilt, “So meikle sakeless Blood be spilt. When King Robert, wise and wight, Had heard and seen this Writ be sight; Therefore he grew full matalent To tell his Barons of his Intent, He call'd a Council to Strivling Town And there came Lords of great Renown, And at them all he ask'd of it If he should answer be his awn Wit: The Lords were all faine of that Thing, And referr'd it to their Noble King; So without Council of onie Man, To Dyte and Write the King began. This was the Effect of his Writing, All is sooth and nae Liesing. I Robert, be God's Might King of the Scots and Isles be Right, From Hight of Hills to thee Ocean Sea, Our Heretage was ever free; To thee Hary of Lancaster, Thy 'Pystle I have considered well. Duke of that Ilk, thou should be call'd, It was thy righteous Style of auld; But nae King I will call thee, For hurting of Kings Majestie; For I will take nae Heeding Of thy unrighteous Invading; For what was right (as is well knawn) Ye all defould within your awn: But we will do you understand What we declare forenent Scotland. Your inward Tale we have well seen, Baith first and last what you do mean; Therefore thou shalt an Answer have, E'en by my Self, attour the Leave; The first Point is, God Witness bear, No Blood for me be spilt in Weir, But giff it be in my Defence, Through thy usurping Violence. And whereas that thou writest thus, Since born were Sons to Old Brutus, That our Antecessors should be, Servants to Yours in ilk Degree; Thou Lyest, thereof it is well knawn, We was ay free within our awn. Albeit John Balioll made a Band, Contrair the Right of fair Scotland. That he was false we will defend With Lives and Fortunes to the End; For our Heretage was ever Free, Since Scota of Egypt tuik the Sea, Whilst ye have ever conquered been: For a Thousand Pounds of Gold Schein To Julius Cæsar Payit yee, Of Tribute, thus ye was not free; With Saxons syne ye were or'thrawn, With them twa Chiftans of your awn, And other Folks in Company, All Soldiers born in Germany, Came with sik Power in great Hast That made your Lands baith bair and waist; And slew your Gentles of Ingland At Salysbury as I understand, In Taking is the Hingand Stanes, That there were set up for their Names; In Latin is a Memorial, That Saxons had orset you all. Then Harald, the Son of Denmark King, The third Time raise o're you to Reign, And in ilk House, as is well knawn, You were defould within your awn; They occupied your Maids and Wives: In Bondage thus ye led your Lives. When this was done and all by past, The fourth Conquest approached fast; A Bastard came out of Normandy, Conquest Ingland all haillily; And yet amongst you Reigns that Blood, And mikle uther that is nae good: Gif thou trows not this true to be, The Register read and thou shalt see. Thus four Times thirld and overharld You're the great Refuse of all the Warld; Nor got thou Righteous thy self to Reigne, Thy awn Realm kenns well this Thing; At London thou Swair in Parliment, Ingland Ten Years thou should absent; Then wast thou manifestly mansworn, Or ever three Years was out worn Thou raise Treasonably for to Reigne, And slew Richard thy Native King. Forsooth the Proverb tells of this, Whilk often times true founden is: Flyte with thy Neighbour, and he will tell All the Mischiefs that thee befel. But Scotland, yet, I dare well say Was ever free unto this day, Nor never stranger weer'd our Crown Except of late a Mansworn Lown, That was Longshanks call'd Edward, Tuik on him to declare the Pairt Between the Bruce and John Balion; Then through your false illusion, Where that John Balioll had no right, And so tuik Treasonably to hauld by Right Castles and Strengths of our Country, Your Edward tuik most Cheatingly, When William Wallace, wight and wise, Right worthily rescued us Thrice; Then Valiant Bruce right racklesly First tint, syne wan us worthily; With him was Graham and the Dowglass That prov'd full well in many a Place, And Thomas Randolf wise and wight, There was not then a worthier Knight: Then thir expelled your false Barnage, And fred our Realm of all Thirlage. If you trow us not of this, Sixty Thousand you well did miss, At Bannockburn discomfist was, And your false King away did pass Throw an inborn Traytour, as was well ken'd, In Ingland free he did him send, Or else we then had tane your King Who had Ingland in governing. When an Year comen was and gane, Then Edward of Carnarven Discomfist he was at Byland, By Messengers I understand, Sir Walter Stewart then in hy, He chased him all openly 'Twixt Scarborough Castle he him chass'd, Syne to his Host return in hast; But then the Clergy of Ingland Renewed again with stalwart Hand, At Newtoun as it was well knawn, Where hastily they were or'thrawn By the good Dowglass, sooth to say, And Thomas Randolf Earle of Murray, There Thirty, Thonsand were dung to Dead, Withouten Succour or Remeid; Syne after that, Robert the Bruce Took hail State, and could reduce Northumberland all to himsell, As many Cronicles can tell. Then ye were fain from Weirs to cease, And sought by Marriage for a Peace, Begging our Prince the Bruce Davie On your Dame Jean to play a Pavie. Ye made this evident, and drew a Band Under the great Seal of Ingland, Whilk we have plainly for to shaw, The Verity if ye will knaw. All this is true, I'le testifie, And prove it on Sixty against Sixty, Or Fortie for Fortie, giff You like, Or Twentie to Twentie of ilk Kinrick, Or Nine, Aught, Seven, Four, Three, or Two Born of Ancient Blood also, Or Hand to Hand if You think meet, And so, Sir Duke, I do you Greet. FINIS. The Enlishman's Grace over his Pock-Pudding. Before Meat. Joy of my Heart, and Comfort of my Life, I love the better than my S?l or Wife: My only Prayer is, D?n my S?l and B?d, But most devoutly pray for the fair Food. 'Tis true a Wife can kiss and Warm the Skin, But thou'rt a Cordial to my all within. Briareus had an hundred Hands to fight. And Argus had as many Eves for Sight: Would Heaven as many Stomachs give to me, How freely would I give them all to thee. How meanly was I made of Dust and Clay, Base Things, which every Beggar throws away: But I've renewed myself, for I am now Intirely transubstantiate in you. How many Nations are in Kin to me? As many as Ingredients in thee. From the West-Indies doth the Sugar come, The Wine and Fruits from Spain to bless my Womb; The Flower and Eggs from our English Soil, A rare Reward for all the Farmer's Toil. The Waters and the Earth are plowed for thee: O my dear Pudding, thou'rt a H?n to me. On Cakes and Crowdy lives an hungry Scot, But O the Blessings of an English Pot, When papling, that's sweet Musick in mine Ear, But on the Table, O the charming Cheer. The Jews beg Canaan's Blessing Milk and Honey, But English Christians, Pudding, Pork and Money. D?n me, if I care who the D?l be K?g, If I get Pork and Pudding in his Reign. Lord, let us never want them when we dine, The Pudding be ours and all the Praise be thine. In Strength of Pork we shall thy Laws fulfill, No Service L?d, unless our Belly's full. After Meat. Z?ds, I have been a Warriour all my Life, In an eternal Battle with the Knife; And every Day I have the victory got, Fifty fat Bullocks have gone down my Throat. O were the Spainish Forces tender Pullets, My Mouth should Cannon be and all my Teeth be Bullets, There should be Slaughter, Blood and Wounds wi' Speed. By Jove, my Belly should take in Madrid. When of my Enemies I have got a Load, How would I bless my Belly and my God: For to besiege Plumb-pudding, or a Pye, R?e me, no such War above the Sky. The Place is strongly fortify'd by Cooks, But I'd advance, and sally thro' its works; I'd cut the Counterscarp, mount the Half-Moon, I'd rather take a Tart, than take a Town. Did not the Heaven-born Homer draw Ulysses, Cooking his Pudding and his costly Dishes; Its fitter, Faith, a Trade, than taking Troy; War wastes the Blood, but Pudding makes the Boy. Our Christmas-Terms are most devoutly spent, D?m the Monkey-Rogue invented Lent, Then we see Goose, and Custard, and the Jeally, So we mind God, because he minds our Belly. I hate the Dron-Days of Abstinence, The Rubrick sure is void of common Sense. Keep English Christians from their Beef and Boil, Is all a Popish Bite, upon my Soul; I'll eat them fairly out, and drink good Liquor, You may be sure, before the very Vicar. L?d put it in K?g G?E and W?e's Head, It would be the Glory of his Reign indeed, To lay aside these fasting scurvy Days, Then we should get good Meat, and God should get the Praise. FINIS.</field>
