      <field name="fulltext">SONNETS. I. [TO THE BLESSED TRINITY.] Svpreme Essence, beginning, vnbegun, Ay Trinall Ane, ane vndevydit Three, Eternall Word, vha victorie hes wun Ouir death, ouir hell, triumphing on the trie, Forknavlege, Wysdome, and All-seing Ee, Iehovah, Alpha and Omega, All, Lyk vnto nane, nor nane lyk vnto Thee, Vnmovt vha movis the rounds about the Ball, Contener vnconteind; is, was, and sall Be, sempiternall, mercifull, and just. Creator vncreatit, nou I call. Teich me Thy treuth, since vnto Thee I trust, Incres, confirme, and strenthen from aboue My faith, my hope, and, by the lave, my loue. II. [OF THE WORKS OF GOD.] High architectur, vondrous-vautit-rounds; Huge host of hevin in restles-rolling spheers; Firme-fixit polis whilk all the axtrie beirs; Concordant-discords, suete harmonious sounds; Boud ?odiak, circle-belting Phœbus bounds; Celestiall signis, of moneths making ?eers; Bright Titan, to the tropiks that reteirs, Quhais fyrie flammis all chaos face confounds; Just balanced ball, amidst the hevins that hings; All creaturs that Natur creat can, To serve the vse of most vnthankfull man;— Admire ?our Maker, only King of Kings. Prais him, O man! His mervels that remarks, Quhais mercyis far exceids His wondrous warks. III. [OF THE INIQUITIE OF MAN.] Iniquitie on eirth is so increst, All flesh bot feu with falset is defyld, Givin ouir of God, with gredynes beguyld; So that the puir, but pitie, ar opprest. God in his justice dou na mair digest Sky sinfull suyn with symonie defyld, Bot must revenge, thair vyces ar so vyld, And pour doun plagues of famin, suord, and pest. Aryse, O Lord, delyuer from the lave Thy faithfull flock befor that it infect. Thou sees hou Satan sharps for to dissave, If it were able, euen thyn auin elect. Sen conscience, love, and cheritie all laiks, Lord, short the season, for the chosens saiks. IV. TO M. DAUID DRUMMOND. As curious Dido Ænee did demand, To vnderstand vha wrakt his toun, and hou Him self got throu and come to Lybia land; To vhom fra hand his body he did bou: With bendit brou, and tuinkling teirs, I trou, He said, if thou, O Quene, wald knau the cace Of Troy, alace! it garis my body grou, To tell it nou, so far to our disgrace; Hou, in short space, that som tym peirles place, Before my face, in furious flammis did burne; Compeld to murne, and than to tak the chace, I ran this race, bot nevir to returne: Sa thou, lyk Dido, Maister Dauid Drummond, Hes me to ansueir, by thy sonet, summond. V. [TO THE SAME.] The hevinly furie that inspyrd my spreit, Quhen sacred beughis war wont my brouis to bind, With frostis of fashrie frozen is that heet; My garland grene is withrit with the wind. ?e knau Occasio hes no hair behind; The bravest spreits hes tryde it treu, I trou; The long forspoken proverb true I find, “No man is man,” and man is no thing nou. The cuccou flees befor the turtle dou; The pratling pyet matchis with the Musis; Pan with Apollo playis, I wot not hou; The attircops Minervas office vsis. These be the grievis that garris Montgomry gr[udge] That Mydas, not Mecenas, is our judge. VI. TO M. P. GALLOWAY. Sound, Gallovay, the trompet of the Lord; The blissit brethren sall obey thy blast; Then thunder out the thretnings of the word Aganst the wicked that auay ar cast. Pray that the faithfull in the fight stand fast. Suppose the Divill the wickeds hairts obdure, ?it perseveir, as in thy preichins past, For to discharge thy conscience and cure. Quhat justice sauld! vhat pilling of the pure! Quhat bluidy murthers ar for gold forgivin! God is not sleipand, thoght He tholde, be sure. Cry out, and He shall heir the from the heuin; And wish the king his court and counsell clenge, Or then the Lord will, in His wrath, revenge. VII. TO HIS MAJESTIE. Shir, clenge ?our cuntrie of thir cruell crymis, Adultries, witchcraftis, incests, sakeles bluid; Delay not, bot as David did betymis, ?our company of such men soon secluid. Out with the wicked;—garde ?ou with the gude; Of mercy and of judgment sey to sing. Quhen ?e suld stryk, I wald ?e vnderstude; Quhen ?e suld spair, I wish ?e were bening. Chuse godly counsel, leirne to be a king. Beir not thir burthenis longer on ?our bak. Jumpe not with justice for no kynd of thing. To just complantis gar gude attendance tak. Thir bluidy sarks cryis alwayis in ?our eiris: Prevent the plague that presently appeirs. VIII. IN PRAISE OF HIS MAJESTIE. Support me, sacred Sisters, for to sing His praise, vhilk passis the antartik pole, And fand the futsteppe of the fleing fole, And from Parnassus spyd the Pegase spring. The hundreth saxt, by lyne, vnconqueist king, Quhais knichtlie curage, kindling lyk a cole, Maks couarts quaik, and hyde thame in a hole: His brand all Brytan to obey sall bring. Come, troup of tuinis, about his temple tuyn ?our laurell leivis with palmis perfytly plet, Wpon his heid Cæsarean to sett. Immortali?e ane nobler nor the Nyne— A martiall monarch, with Minervas spreit, That Prince vhilk sall the prophesie comp[leit.] IX. IN PRAISE OF M. J. M., CHANCELLER. Of Mars, Minerva, Mercure, and the Musis, The curage, cunning, eloquence, and vain Maks maikles Maitland mirrour to remane, As instrument vhilk these for honour vsis, Quhais fourfald force with furie him infusis In battells, counsels, orisones, and brain. It neids no proofe; experience is plane; A cunning king a cunning chanceller chuisis. Quhat happines the hevins on him bestoues Hes trimlie at this trublous tyme bene tryde. Thoght worthynes of wreches be invyde, ?it wonted verteu ay the grener grouis. Then, lyk his name, the gods for armis him giv[es] Suord, pen, and wings, in croun of laurel lei[ves.] X. IN PRAIS OF THE KINGS VRANIE. Bellonas sone, of Mars the chosen chyld, Minervas wit, and Mercuris goldin tung, Apollos light, that ignorance exyld, From Jove ingendrit, and from Pallas sprung, Thy Vranie, O second Psalmist! sung, Triumphis ouer death, in register of fame; Quharfor thy trophee trimlie sall be hung With laurell grene, eterni?ing thy name. Bot euen as Phœbus shyning does ashame Diana with hir boroude beimis and blind; So vhen I preis thy praysis to proclame, Thy weghtie words maks myne appeir bot wind. ?it, worthy Prince! thou wald tak in gude pairt My will for weill; I want bot only arte. XI. [OF THE SAME.] Of Titans harp, sith thou intones the strings, Of ambrose and of nectar so thou feeds, Not only vther poets thou outsprings, Bot vhylis also thy very self excedes; Transporting thee as ravishd, vhen thou redes Thyn auin inventione, wondering at thy wit. Quhat mervell than, thoght our fordullit hedes And blunter brainis be mare amaisd at it; To sie thy ?eirs and age, vhilks thou hes ?it, Inferiour far to thy so grave ingyne; Quha ha?ard at so high a mark, and hit, In English, as this Vranie of thyne: Quharfor thy name, O Prince! eternall ringis, Quhais muse not Jove, bot grit Jehova singis. XII. [OF THE SAME.] Can goldin Titan shyning bright at morne, For light of torches, cast a gritter shau? Can thunder reird the higher for a horne? Craks cannouns louder thoght a cok suld crau? Can our waik breathis help Boreas to blau? Can candle lou give fyr a griter heet? Can quhytest suanis more quhyter mak the snau? Can virgins teirs augment the winter[s weet?] Helps pyping Pan Apollos musik sueet? Can fontans smal the ocean sea incres? No: they augment the griter not a quheet, Bot they thaim selfis appeir to grou the les: So, peirles Prince! thy cunning maks the knoune; Ours helps not thyn: we stein?ie bot our aune. XIII. [OF THE SAME.] As bright Apollo staineth euiry star With goldin rayis, vhen he begins to ryse, Quhais glorious glance ?it stoutly skaillis the sk[yis,] Quhen with a wink we wonder vhair they war; Befor his face for feir they faid so far, And vanishis auay in such a wayis, That in thair spheirs thay dar not interpryse For to appeir lyk planeits, as they ar: Or as the phœnix, with her fedrum fair, Excels all foulis in diverse hevinly heuis, Quhais natur, contrare natur, sho reneuis, As onlie but companione or compair: So, quintessenst of kings! vhen thou compyle, Thou stanis my versis with thy staitly style. XIV. TO HIS MAJESTIE, FOR HIS PENSIOUN. Help, Prince, to vhom, on vhom not I complene, Bot on, not to fals fortun, ay my fo; Quha but, not by a resone, reft me fro; Quho did, not does, ?it suld my self sustene. Of crymis, not cairs, since I haif kept me clene, I thole, not thanks thame, Sir, vho servd me so; Quha heght, not held to me, and mony mo, To help, not hurt, bot hes not byding bene: Sen will, not wit, to lait vhilk I lament, Of sight, not service, shed me from ?our grace. With, not without ?our warrand, ?it I went; In wryt, not words; the papers ar in place: Sen chance, not change, hes put me to this pane, Let richt, not reif, my pensioun bring agane. XV. [TO THE SAME.] If lose of guids, if gritest grudge or grief, If povertie, imprisonment, or pane, If for guid will ingratitude agane, If languishing in langour but relief, If det, if dolour, and to become deif, If travell tint, and labour lost in vane, Do properly to poets appertane— Of all that craft my chance is to be chief. With August, Virgill wauntit his reuard, And Ovids lote als lukles as the lave; Quhill Homer livd, his hap wes wery hard, ?it, vhen he died, sevin cities for him strave: Thoght I am not lyk one of thame in arte, I pingle thame all perfytlie in that parte. XVI. [TO THE SAME.] If I must begge, it sall be far fra hame; If I must want, it is aganis my will; I haif a stomok, thoght I hold me still, To suffer smart, bot not to suffer shame. In spyt of fortun, I shall flie with fame; Sho may my corps, bot not my curage kill: My hope is high, houbeit my hap be ill, And kittle aneugh, and clau me on the kame. Wes Bishop Betoun bot restord agane, To my ruin reserving all the rest, To recompence my prisoning and pane! The worst is ill, if this be bot the best. Is this the frute, Sir, of your first affectione, My pensioun perish vnder your protectione? XVII. [TO THE SAME.] Adeu, my King, court, cuntrey, and my kin: Adeu, suete Duke, vhose father held me deir: Adeu, companiones, Constable and Keir: Thrie treuar hairts, I trou, sall neuer tuin. If byganes to revolve I suld begin, My tragedie wald cost ?ou mony a teir To heir hou hardly I am handlit heir, Considring once the honour I wes in. Shirs, ?e haif sene me griter with his Grace, And with ?our vmquhyle Maister, to, and myne; Quha thoght the Poet somtyme worth his place, Suppose ?e sie they shot him out sensyne. Sen wryt, nor wax, nor word is not a word: I must perforce ga seik my fathers suord. XVIII. TO THE LORDS OF THE SESSION. Quhare bene ?e, brave and pregnant sprits, becum? Quik vive inventionis, ar ?e worne auay? I am assuird by simpathie that sum Wald never wish that cunning suld decay. If ony be, ?our Lordships must be thay, Whose spreits ?our weeds of verteu hes you spun; Then mak the poet pensioner, I pray, And byde be justice, as ?e haif begun. Sen I haif richt, vhy suld I be ouirrun? Incurage me, and able I can carpe: Hald evin the weyis; the victory is wun, As I confyde in King and solid Sharpe: Quhom I culd len a lift, your Lordships knauis, War they in love, as I am in the lauis. XIX. [TO THE SAME.] Alace! my Lords, hou long will ?e delay To put the poets pensione out of plie? ?on shifting sophists hes no thing to say; Their feckles flyting is not worth a flie. Mak Bishop Betone vhat they lyk to be: He must perforce be ather quik or deid. If he be deid, the mater maks for me; If he be quik, then they can cum no speid. By consequence, it can not bot succeid, For laik of forces they must tyn the feild; And for the Bishope, I defy his feid; ?ok vhen we will, I hope to gar him ?eild. So, good my Lords, I crave no more of ?ou, Bot shift me not vhill ?e haif slane my sou. XX. [TO THE SAME.] How long will ?e the poets patience prove? Shaip ?e to shift him lyk a pair of cartis? Look vp, my Lords; thair is a Lord above, Quha seis the smallest secreit of ?our hairts. He vnderstands ?our offices and ?our airts; He knauis vhat is committit to ?our cure; He recompencis, as ?e play your pairts, Once, soon or syne, ?our Lordships must be sure; For he respects no princes more then pure. Quhat evir ?e do then, hald the ballance evin; Sa to do justice, I ?ou all conjure, As ?e will merit ather hell or hevin. Deserv not de (before ?our Lordships) fames; For I may able enterni?e ?our names. XXI. [TO THE SAME.] My Lords, late lads, nou leidars of our lauis, Except ?our gouns, some hes not worth a grote. ?our colblak conscience all the cuntrey knauis; Hou can ?e live, except ?e sell ?our vote? Thoght ?e deny, thair is aneu to note How ?e for justice jouglarie hes vsit: Suppose ?e say ?e jump not in a jote, God is not blind, He will not be abusit. The tym sall come vhen ?e sall be accu[sit,] For mony hundreth ?e haif herryit heir; Quhare ?e sall be forsakin and refusit, And syn compeld at Plotcok to appeir. I hope in God at lenth, thoght it be late, To sie sum sit into [dirk hellis gate]. XXII. TO HIS ADUERSARS LAUYERS. Presume not, Prestone, Stirling is no strenth; Suppose ?e come to cleik auay my King, Beleiv me baith, ?e sall be lost at lenth; Assure ?our selfis, and think nane other thing. Byde ?e the brash, vhill I my battrie bring. For all ?our Craig, vharin ?e so confyde, Experience will play ?ou sik a spring, Sall pluk ?our pennis, and pacifie ?our pryde. I sall beseige ?ou sa on euirie syde, ?our baggage, buluarks, sall not be na buit; ?e sall not haif ane hoill ?our heids to hyde, Fra tym ?e caus my cannoun royal shuit. Haif at ?our rocks and ramparts with a rattill; Sho shuits so Sharpe, ?e dou not byde a brattill. XXIII. OF M. J. SHARPE. If gentle blude ingendrit be by baggis, Then culd I ges vho wer a gentle Jhone; If he be wysest, with the world that waggis, ?it culd I wish ?ou to a wittie one; If he be all, vha thinks his nichtbours none, Then surely I suld shau ?ou vho wer all; If he be Cæsar, vho doth so suppone, Then I conjecture vhom I Cæsar call; If he be sure, vho sueirs and sayis he sall, Then certainly I wot weill vho wer sure; If he be firme, vho neuer feirs to fall, I doubt not then vhose dayis suld lang indure; Sed quæritur, vhat lau he leivis at leist? He wald not preich; he can not be a preist. XXIV. [OF THE SAME.] A Baxters bird, a bluiter beggar borne, Ane ill heud huirsone, lyk a barkit hyde, A saulles suinger, seuintie tymes mensuorne, A peltrie pultron poysond vp with pryde, A treuthles tongue that turnes with eviry tyde, A double deillar with dissait indeud, A luiker bak vhare he wes bund to byde, A retrospicien vhom the Lord outspeud, A brybour baird that mekle baill hes breud, Ane hypocrit, ane ydill atheist als, A skurvie skybell for to be esheud, A faithles, feckles, fingerles, and fals, A Turk that tint Tranent for the Tolbuith: Quha reids this riddill he is Sharpe forsuith. XXV. TO R. HUDSONE. My best belouit brother of the band, I grein to sie the sillie smiddy smeik. This is no lyfe that I live vpaland On rau rid herring reistit in the reik, Syn I am subject somtyme to be seik, And daylie deing of my auld diseis. Eit bread, ill aill, and all things are ane eik; This barme and blaidry buists up all my bees. ?e knau ill guyding genders mony gees, And specially in poets. For example, ?e can pen out tua cuple and ?e pleis; ?ourself and I, old Scot and Robert Semple. Quhen we ar dead, that all our dayis bot daffis, Let Christan Lyndesay wryt our epitaphis. XXVI. [TO THE SAME.] With mightie maters mynd I not to mell, As copping courts, or comonwelthis, or kings, Quhais craig ?oiks fastest, let tham sey thame sell; My thoght culd nevir think vpon sik things. I wantonly wryt vnder Venus wings; In Cupids court ?e knau I haif bene kend, Quhair Muses ?it som of my sonets sings, And shall do aluayis to the worlds end. Men hes no caus my cunning to commend, That it suld merit sik a memorie; ?it ?e haif sene his Grace oft for me send, Quhen he took plesure into poesie. Quhill tyme may serve, perforce I must refrane, That pleis his Grace I come to Court agane. XXVII. [TO THE SAME.] I feid affectione vhen I sie his Grace, To look on that vhairin I most delyte; I am a li?ard, fainest of his face, And not a snaik, with poyson him to byte; Quhais shapes alyk, thoght fashions differ quyt: The one doth love, the other hateth still. Vhare some taks plesur, others tak despyte: One shap, one subject, wishis weill and ill; Euen so will men—bot no man judge [I will,]— Baith loue and loth, and only bot ane thing. I can not skan these things above my skill. Loue vhome they lyk; for me, I loue the King, Vhose Highnes laughed som tym for to look Hou I chaist Polwart from the chimney [nook.] XXVIII. [TO THE SAME.] Remembers thou in Æsope of a taill? A louing dog wes of his maister fane; To faun on him wes all his pastym haill. His courteous maister clappit him agane. By stood ane asse, a beist of blunter brane, Perceiving this, bot looking to no freet, To pleis hir maister with the counterpane, Sho clambe on him with hir foull clubbit feet. To play the messan thoght sho wes not [meit,] Sho meinit weill, I grant; hir mynd wes guid: Bot vhair sho troude hir maister suld hir [treit,] They battound hir vhill that they sau hir bluid. So stands with me, vho loues with all my [hairt] My maister best: some taks it in ill pa[irt.] XXIX. [TO THE SAME.] Bot sen I sie this proverbe to be true, “Far better hap to court, nor service good,” Fairueill, my brother Hudsone [nou to ?ou] Vho first fand out of Pegase fut the flood, And sacred hight of Parnase mytred hood; From vhence som tyme the son of [Venus] sent Tua seuerall shaftis vher he of Delphos stood, With Pennevs dochter hoping to acquent. Thy Homers style, thy Petrarks high invent, Sall vanquish death, and live eternally; Quhais boasting bou, thoght it be aluayis bent, Sall neuer hurt the sone of Memorie. Thou onlie brother of the Sisters Nyne, Shau to the King this poor complant of myne. XXX. CHRISTEN LYNDESAY TO RO. HUDSONE. Oft haive I hard, bot ofter fund it treu, That courteours kyndnes lasts bot for a vhyle. Fra once ?our turnes be sped, vhy then adeu; ?our promeist freindship passis in exyle. Bot, Robene, faith, ?e did me not beguyll; I hopit ay of ?ou as of the lave: If thou had wit, thou wald haif mony a wyle, To mak thy self be knaune for a knaive. Montgomrie, that such hope did once conceave Of thy guid-will, nou finds all is forgotten. Thoght not bot kyndnes he did at the craiv, He finds thy friendship as it rypis is rotten. The smeikie smeithis cairs not his passit trauel, Bot leivis him lingring, déing of the gravell. XXXI. TO M. J. MURRAY. Flie louer, Phœnix. Feirs thou not to fyre Invironing the aluayis-upuard ayr? Vhich thou must pas, before that thou come [thair] Vharas thy sprit so spurris thee to aspyre; To wit, aboue the planetis to impyre, Behind the compas of Apollos chayr, And tuinkling round of burning rubies rare, Quhair all the gods thy duelling do desyre. Bot duilfull doom of destinies thee dammis, Before thy blissit byding be above, The mortal from immortall to remove, To sacrifice thy self to Phœbus flammis. I prophecye, vhen so sall come to pa[sse,] We nevir sie such one come of thy [asse.] XXXII. TO M. L. RUTHUEN, DUCHES OF LENNOX. I love the lillie as the first of flours, Vhose staitly stalk so streight vp is and stay, To vhome the laive ay lowly louts and [cours,] As bund so brave a beuty to obey. Amongs thame selfis it semes as they suld [say:] “Sueet Lillie, as thou art our lamp of light, Resave our homage to thy honours ay, As kynd commands to render thee thy right. Thy blisfull beams, with beutie burnisht bright, So honours all the gardein vhair thou grouis, For suetest smell and shyning to the sight; The heuins on the sik [matchless grace bestouis,] That vho persaivis thy excellence by ours Must love the lillie as the first of flours.” XXXIII. A LADYIS LAMENTATIONE. Vhom suld I warie bot my wicked weard, Vha span my thriftles thrauard fatall threed? I wes bot skantlie entrit in this eard, Nor had offendit, vhill I felt hir feed. In hir vnhappy hands sho held my heed, And straikit bakuard wodershins my hair; Syne prophecyed, I suld aspyre and speed: Quhilk double sentence wes baith suith and sair, For I wes matchit with my match and mair; No worldly woman neuir wes so weill; I wes accountit Countes but compair, Quhill fickle Fortun whirld me from hir vheell: Rank and renoun in lytill roum sho ranged, And Lady Lucrece in a Cressede changed. XXXIV. [THE SAME.] Melpomene, my mirthles murning Muse! Wouchsaiv to help a wrechit woman weep, Vhose chanch is cassin that sho can not chuse Bot sigh, and sobbe, and soun, vhen sho suld sleep. More hevynes within my hairt I heep, Nor cative Cresside, vhair sho lipper lay. Dispair hes dround my hapeless hope so deep, My sorrie song is, oh and welauay! Euen as the oul that dar not sie the day, For feir [of foulis that then about do proull,] So am I nou, exyld from honour ay, Compaird to Cresside and the vgly oull. Fy, lothsome lyfe! Fy, death, that dou not [serve me] Bot quik and dead a bysin thow must [preserve me]. XXXV. [THE SAME.] Lord, for my missis micht I mak a mends, By putting me to penance as thou pleasd! Good God! forgive offenders that offends, And heall the hurt of sik as are diseasde; Hou soon they murne, with mercy thou [art measde] As thou hes said; and surely so it semes: Suppose my silly saull with sin be seasde, ?it the reversiones rests that it redemes. Destroy me not, that so of the estemes, My suete Redemer; let me neuer die, Bot blink on me euen with Thy blisful b[eames,] And mak ane other Magdelene of me. Forgive my gylt, sen nane bot God is gude; So with “Peccavi Pater” I conclude. XXXVI. [THE SAME.] Fane wald I speir vhat spreit doth me [inspyre.] I haif my wish, and ?it I want my will; I covet lyfe, and ?it my corps I kill; I vrne for anger, ?it I haif no yre; I flie the flammis, ?it folouis on the [fire;] I lyk my lote, and ?it my luk is ill; I ?oldin am, and ?it am stryving still; I dreid dispair, ?it hope hes heght me hyre; My bluid is brunt, and ?it my breist does bleid; I haif no hurt, and ?it my hairt hes harmes; I am ouircome, but enimie or armis: The doctours doubtis if I be quik or deid: If that I kneu of vhome I culd inquyre, Fain wold I speir vhat spreit does me inspyre. XXXVII. [THE SAME.] My plesuris past procures my present pain; My present pain expels my plesurs past; My languishing, alace! is lyk to last; My greif ay groues, my gladenes wants a grane; My bygane joyes I can not get agane, Bot, once imbarkit, I must byde the blast. I can not chuse; my kinsh is not to cast: To wish it war, my wish wald be bot vane: ?it, vhill I sey my senses to dissaive, To pleis my thoght, I think a thousand things, Quhilks to my breist bot boroude blythnes brings: Anis hope I had, thoght nou dispair I haive: A stratagem, thoght strange, to stay my sturt, By apprehensioun for to heill my hurt. XXXVIII. [THE SAME.] I wyt myne ee for vieuing of my wo; I wyt myn earis for heiring my mishap; I wyt my senses vhilks dissavit me so; I wyt acquentance that in credit crap; I wyt the trane that took me with a trap; I wyt affectione formest to the feild; I wyt misluk that suld me [so enwrap;] I wyt my ?outh that bot a promeis ?eild; I wyt my stomoch wes not stoutly ste[ild;] I wyt hir looks vhilk left me not alane; I wyt my wisdome suld haif bene my sheild; I wyt my tongue that told vhen I wes ta[ne:] Had I my counsell keepit vndeclairde, I might haif dred, bot deidly not dispairde. XXXIX. [TO HIS MAISTRES.] Bright amorous ee vhare Love in ambush [lyes]— Cleir cristal tear distilde at our depairt— Sueet secreit sigh more peircing nor a dairt— Inchanting voce, beuitcher of the wyse— Quhyt ivory hand, vhilk thrust my finger [s pryse]— I challenge ?ou, the causers of my smarte, As homiceids, and murtherers of my harte, In Resones court to suffer ane assyse. Bot, oh! I fear, ?ea rather wot I weill, To be repledgt ?e plainly will appeill To Love, whom Resone never culd comm[and:] Bot, since I can not better myn estate, ?it, vhill I live, at leist I sall regrate Ane ee, a teir, a sigh, a voce, a hand. XL. [TO THE SAME.] Thyne ee the glasse vhare I beheld my [hairt;] Myn ee the windo throu the vhilk thyn ee May see my hairt, and thair thy self espy In bloody colours hou thou painted art. Thyne ee the pyle is of a murth[erers dairt;] Myne ee the sicht thou taks thy levell by, To shute my hairt, and nevir shute aury: Myn ee thus helpis thyn ee to work my smarte. Thyn ee consumes me lyk a flamming fyre; Myn ee most lyk a flood of teirs do run. Oh! that the water, in myne ee begun, Micht quench the burning fornace of desyre! Or then the fyr els kindlit by thyn ey, The flouing teirs of sorrou micht mak dry! XLI. [TO THE SAME.] So suete a kis ?istrene fra thee I reft, In bouing doun thy body on the bed, That evin my lyfe within thy lippis I left; Sensyne from thee my spirits wald neuer shed; To folou thee it from my body fled, And left my corps als cold as ony kie. Bot vhen the danger of my death I dred, To seik my spreit I sent my harte to thee; Bot it wes so inamored with thyn ee, With thee it myndit lykuyse to remane: So thou hes keepit captive all the thrie, More glaid to byde then to returne agane. Except thy breath thare places had suppleit, Euen in thyn armes thair doutles had I deit. XLII. JAMES LAUDER. I wald se mare. I wald se mare nor ony thing I sie; I sie not ?it the thing that I desyre: Desyre it is that does content the ee; The ee it is vhilk settis the hairt in fyre. In fyre to fry, tormentit thus, I tyre; I tyre far mair, till tyme these flammis I feid: I feed affectione, spurring to aspyre Aspyre I sall, in esperance to speid; To speed I hope, thoght danger still I dreid; I dreid no thing bot ouer long delay: Delay in love is dangerous indeed; Indeid I shape the soner to assay; Assay I sall, hap ill or weill, I vou; I vou to ventur, to triumph I trou. XLIII. ISSOBELL YONG. By loving so. I trou ?our love by loving so vnsene; Vnsene siklyk I languish for ?our love: ?our love is comely, constant, chaste, and clene; And clene is myne, experience sall prove; Prove vhen ?e pleis, I mynd not to remove; Remove vho may, if Destinies decreit: Decreit is givin by Hymen high above; Aboue all bands that blissed band is sweet: Sueit is that ?ok so mutuall and meet; And meit it war we met, if that we might: We might perhaps our purpose then compleit: Compleit it quickly, Reson thinks it right. Right beiring rule, the righteous suld rejose: Rejose in God, and on His will repose. XLIV. EUFAME WEMIS. Treu fame we mis thy trumpet for to tune, To blau a blast a beuty for to blaise; A paragone vhilk poets oght to praise: Had I that science, I suld sey it sune: ?it, as I dar, my deutie sall be done With more affectione nor with formall phrais. I seme, vhill I vpon hir graces ga?e, Endymion enamord with the Mone. My Muse, let Mercure language to me len, With Pindar pennis, for to outspring the spheirs; Or Petrarks pith, surpassing all my peirs, To pingill Apelles pynsell with my pen, And not to say, as we haif said abone, Trew fame, we mis thy trumpet for to tone. XLV. JOHN JHONSONE—JANE MAXWELL. Sueit soull, perceive hou secreit I conceill, Rad to reveill that peirtly I propone. Look ony one before me loved so leill; Examene weill; oh! oh! we seet in none. Good love is gone, except my love alone, Thoght gromes can grone as they wald give the ghost; Half mangd almost, als stupefact as stone, Lyk treuth in throne, they look as they wer lost. They turne, they tost, they rave, they rage, they rost, As catives crost, vhill they ?our favour find. To bid ?ou bind thair purpose, runs the post; Bot bund they bost how . . . ?it trying tyme, the touchstone of my treuth, As resone wold, requests ?ou to haif reuth. XLVI. HIS MAISTRES NAME. Quhat pregnant sprit the letters can espy My ladyis name and surname that begins? Betuixt thame (ay) in ordour, is bot I, And only I these lovely letters tuins; Thoght rekles redars rashly ouer this rins, ?it sharper shuters ner the mark will shute. Shute on; lat sie vho first my wedfie w[ins;] For I will wed ane apple and a nute. To brek ?our brains, ?e bunglers, is no bute; The mair ?e muse, the mare ?e misse the [mark.] I count ?our cunning is not worth a cute, That cannot kyth ?our self to be a c[lark.] Or ?e this find, I feir ?e first be fane For to begin ?our A, B, C agane. XLVII. TO HIS MAISTRES MESSANE. Ha! lytill dog, in happy pairt thou crap, If thou had skill thy happynes to spy, That secreit in my ladyis armis may ly, And sleip so sueitly in hir lovely lap. Bot I, alace! in wrechednes me wrap, Becaus ouer weill my misery knou I, For that my ?outh to leirne I did apply; My ouer grit skill hes maid my oune mishap. Vhy haif I not, O God, als blunt a [braine] As he that daylie worbleth in the wyne, Or to mak faggots for his fuid is fane? Lyk as I do I suld not die and duyn: My pregnant spreit, the hurter of my harte, Lyk às it does, suld not persave my smarte. XLVIII. TO M. D. For Skelmurley. Sweet Philomene, with cheiping chyrris and charris, In hauthornes vher thou hyds thy self and hants, Beuailing thy virginitie thou wants, My harte to grone for very grief thou garris, Thy mirthles mone my melody so marris; Vhill as thy changing, chivring nots thou chants, The peircing pyks groues at thy gorge thou grants; So neir is skaith, suppose thou skantly skarris. For murning I may be thy mirthles match: As thou art banishd, so am I exyld; As thou art trumped, so am I begyld; Thou art vnweirdit, I a woful wrech; Thou art ashamed to shau thy secreit smart: My ladyis bagie beirs my bluidy hart. XLIX. [TO THE SAME.] Thoght peirlis give pryce, and diamonds be deir, Or royall rubies countit rich and rare, The MARGARIT does merit mekle mare, As jem of jeuels, paragone but peir. Wald God if it wer gettible for geir! Culd it be coft, for cost I wald not care; Both lyfe and goods, to win it, wold I [ware,] Provyding I war worthy it to weir. Nixt wald I wish my purpose broght to [pas,] That I micht tak and tame the turtle DO[U,] And set hir syne vhare that I micht sie th[rou] Ane costly cage of cleirest cristall GLAS; Vhilks with my jeuell micht I joyne, I gra[nt,] I culd not wish in world [ought] that I want. L. OF MY LADY SEYTON. M. M. O happy star, at evning and at morne, Vhais bright aspect my maistres first out [fand!] O happy credle! and O happy hand Vhich rockit hir the hour that sho wes b[orne!] O happy pape, ?e rather nectar hor[ne,] First gaiv hir suck, in siluer suedling band! O happy wombe consavit had beforne So brave a beutie, honour of our land! O happy bounds, vher dayly ?it scho duells, Vhich Inde and Egypts happynes excells! O happy bed vharin sho sall be laid! O happy babe in belly sho sall breid! Bot happyer he that hes that hap indeid, To mak both wyfe and mother of that [maid.] LI. TO THE FOR ME. Suete Nichtingale! in holene grene that han[ts,] To sport thy self, and speciall in the spring; Thy chivring chirlis, vhilks changinglie thou [chants,] Maks all the roches round about the ring; Vhilk slaiks my sorou, so to heir the sing, And lights my louing langour at the leist; ?it thoght thou sees not, sillie, saikles thing! The piercing pykis brods at thy bony breist. Euin so am I, by plesur lykuyis preist, In gritest danger vhair I most delyte: Bot since thy song, for shoring, hes not ceist, Suld feble I, for feir, my conqueis quyt? Na, na—I love the, freshest Phœnix fair! In beuty, birth, in bounty but compair. LII. [TO THE SAME.] Love lent me wings of hope and high desyre, Syn bad me flie, and feir not for ane fall. ?it tedious trauell tystit me to tyre, Vhill Curage come, and culd me couart call. As Icarvs with wanton waxit wings, Ayme at the only A per se of all; Vhilk staynis the sun, that sacred thing of things, And spuris my spreit, that to the heuins it springs, Quyt ravisht throu the region of the air, Vhair ?it my hairt in hoping ha?ard hings, At poynt to speid, or quikly to despair. ?et shrink not, hairt! as simple as thou semes, If thou be brunt, it is with beuties bemes. LIII. [TO THE SAME.] Go, Pen and Paper! publish my complantis; Waill weghtie words, because ?e cannot weep; For pitthie poemis prettilie out paintis My secreit sighis as sorouis gritest heep, Bred in my breist, ?e rather dungeon deep, As prisoners perpetually in pane, Vhilk hes the credit of my harte to keep, In martyrdome, but mercy, to remane. Anatome?e my privie passionis plane, That sho my smart by sympathie may [sie,] If they deserve to get some grace agane; Vhilk if they do not, I desyr to die. Go, sonet, soon unto my Soveran say, Redeme ?our man, or dam him but delay. LIV. [ON HIS MAISTRES.] Vhat subject, sacred Sisters, sall I sing? Vhase praise, Apollo, sal my pen proclame? Vhat nymph, Minerva, sall thy novice [name?] The bravest blossome beutie can outbring, On staitly stalk new sprouting, furth [sall spring.] Hou sall I sound the fanphar of hir fame, Vhais angels ees micht mak the sun thin[k shame,] As half eclipsed, in the heuins to hing! Bot hola, Muse! thou mints at such a ma[rk,] Vhais merit far excedes thy slender skill; ?it, if hir grace, for weill, accept gude [will,] Then war thou weil reuardit for thy wark: Bot since to mount thy maistres the commands, With hope, once ha?ard for to kis hir hands. LV. [ON THE SAME.] Hir brouis, tuo bouis of ebane ever bent; Hir amorous ees the awfull arrouis ar; The archer, Love, vho shoots so sharpe and far; My breist, the butt vhairat hir shots ar sent; My lyf, the wageour, if I win the war; My patience pleids my proces at the bar; My bluid, the long expensis I haif spent; My secrete sighis, solisters for my sute; My trinkling teirs, the presents I propyne; My constancie, hir councellours to enclyne: Bot rigour ryvis the hairt out by the root. Hope heghts me help, bot feir finds no refuge: My pairties ar my javellour and my judge. LVI. [ON THE SAME.] Excuse me, Plato, if I suld suppone That vnderneth the heuinly vauted round, Without the world, or in pairts profound By Stix inclosd, that emptie place is none. If watrie vauts of air be full echone, Then vhat contenis my teirs vhich so abound With sighis and sobbis, which to the hevins I sound, Vhen Love delytis to let me mak my mone? Suppose the solids subtilis ay restrantis, Vhich is the maist, my maister, ?e may mene; Thoght all war void, ?it culd they not contene The half, let be the haill of my complaintis. Vhair go they then? the question wald I c[rave,] Except for ruth the hevins suld thame [ressave.] LVII. [ON THE SAME.] Vha wald behold him vhom a god so grievis? Vhom he assaild, and dantond with his [dairt,] Of vhom he frei?is and inflams the hairt, Vhais shame siclyk him gritest honour givis? Vha wald behald a ?outh that nevir [leives,] In vain, to folou the object of his smarte? Behold bot me, persaiv my painfull pairt, And the archer that, but mercy, me misch[eivis.] Thair sall he sie vhat Resone then [can do] Against his bou, if once he mint bot to Compell our hairts in bondage basse to be[ir,] ?it sall he se me happiest appeir, That in my hairt the amorous heid does [lie] Vith poysond poynt, vhairof I glore [to die.] LVIII. [ON THE SAME.] Hou long sall I in languishing lament? Hou long sall I bot duyne, and dou not di[e?] Hou long sall Love, but mercy, murther me? Hou long against me sall his bou be bent? Hou long sall pane my plesur so prevent? Hou long sall weping blind my watrie ee? Hou long sall baill my bed felou ?it be? Or vhen sall I with comfort be acquent? Hou long sall hope be hindrit be mishap? Hou long ?it, Love, will thou my patience prove? Hou long sall wo in wrechitnes me wrap? Vp once, and my melancholie remove. Revenge, revert, revive, revest, reveall, My hurt, my hairt, my hope, my hap, my heall. LIX. OF THE DULEWEID. The burning sparkis of Helens angells ee, But missing any, woundit eviry wicht That come within the boushot of her sicht; Bot Love, vhose harte compassion had to see Sa many lovers, but redemption, dee, Vha war attrapit with so sueet a slicht, In murning blak he cled this beutie bricht, As funerall mark and handsen?ie to be. But all in vane, alace! I must confes; For why? a thousand lovers not the les, Thoght they persaivd that Burrio Death to bost Within [hir] eyis, and sau him vhar he sat, ?it feirles ran they, not withstanding that, To se these eyis; and syn gaiv vp the ghost. LX. [OF THE SAME.] Had I a foe that hated me to dead, For my reuenge, I wish him no more ill Bot to behold hir eyis, vhilk euer still Ar feirce against me with so sueet a feid. Hir looks belyve such horrour suld him b[reid,] His wish wold be, his cative corps to kill. Euen Plesurs self could not content his wi[ll;] Except the, Death, no thing culd him rem[eid.] The vgly looks of old Medusas eyi[s,] Compaird to hirs, ar not bot poets leyis; For hirs exceids thame in a sharper sort: The Gorgon bot transformit men in sta[nis,] Bot she inflammis and frei?is both at anis. To spul?ie hairt, that minion makes hir sp[ort.] LXI. [OF THE SAME.] Quhat suld I wish, if wishing war not va[ne?] Gold? silver? stones? or precious peirlis of I[nd?] No, no; I carie not a misers mynd; I wish no more bot to be borne agane; Provyding that I micht a man rema[ne,] And sho that bure me, euen of sik a kyn[d] That in hir birth hir persone war not py[nd,] Bot ay the plesur to exceid the pane. Then to be borne into a bonie bark, To saill the seyis, in sik tym of the ?eir Vhen hevy hartis it helthsum halds to he[ir] The mirthful mav[is] and the lovesome [larke.] In end, I wold, my voyage being maid, LXII. THE POETS APOLOGIE TO THE KIRK OF EDINBURGH. I wonder of ?our Wisdomes, that ar wyse, That baith miskennis my method and my Muse; Quhen I invey, such epithets I wse, That evin Alecto laughing at me lyis. My trumpets tone is terribler be tuyis Nor ?on couhorne, vhereof ?e me accuse; For fra the Fureis me with fyr infuse, Quhom Bautie byts, he deir that bargan byis; For if I open wp my anger anes, To plunge my pen into that stinking Styx, My tongue is lyk the lyons; vhair it liks, It brings the flesh, lyk bryrie, fra the banes: I think it scorne, besyd the skaith and sklander, To euin an ape with aufull Alexander. LXIII. THAT HE WROT NOT AGANSTE THE MADINS OF EDINBURGH. Quhat reckles rage hes armde thy tygirs tung, On sueit and simple soulis to speu thy spyte? Quhat syren suld such poysond songs haif sung? Quhat deuill such ditties devysit to indyte? Quhat madnes movd such venemous vords to [write?] Quhat hellish hands hes led thy bluidie pen? Quhat furious feynd inflamde thee so to fl[yte?] Thee—no wyse nou to numbred be with men. Quhat euer thou be, thou art a knave, [I ken,] So leudly on these lassis to haif leid; And if thou pleis, appoint hou, vhair, and vhen, And I sall mak thee, Beist! not to byde be [it,] That nather they ar sik as thou hes said, Nor I am he these rascall raylings maid. LXIV. TO HIS MAJESTIE. That he wrote no[t] against vmqull M. Jane Cuninghame. Sir, I am sorie that ?e suld suppone Me to be one in lucre to delyte, Or speu despyt against hir vho is gone: No—nevir none culd fee me so to flyte. I war to wyt, the bureit to bakbyte, Or to indyt hir families defame, Thoght Cuningham—in conscience I am quy[te,] By word or wryt. Aneugh nou for my n[ame.] I sueat for shame, besyd the blot and b[lame,] Men suld proclame it wer Montgomrie[s muse:] Fy! I refuse sik filthie these or theam, Houbeit at hame mair vncouthnes we wse. I must confes, it war a fekles fead, Quha docht do nocht bot to detract the [deid.] LXV. From London TO W. MURRAY. Belouit brother, I commend me to ?ou. Pleis ?ou, resaiv this lytil pretie ring, With all the rest of goodnes I may do ?ou, Quhan I may vaik fra service of the king. Sen for ?our saik I keepit sik a thing, I mene the pece of lether from ?our spur, If I for?et—in hemp, God! nor ?e hing!— Vncourtessie comes aluayis of a cur. Bat ?e sall find me byding lyk a bur, Quhilk lichtlie will not leiv the grip it gettis; And am right dortie to come ouir the dur, For thame that by my kyndnes no-thing settis. Thus haif I bene as ?it, and sal be so; Kynd to my freind, bot fremmit to my fo. LXVI. LADYLAND TO CAP. A. MONTEGOMERIE. My best belouit brother of the craft, God! if ?e kneu the stait that I am in! Thoght ?e be deif, I knou ?e ar not daft, Bot kynd aneugh to any of ?our kin; If ?e bot sau me, in this winter win, With old bogogers, hotching on a sped, Draiglit in dirt, vhylis wat evin to the [skin,] I trou thair suld be tears or we tua shed. Bot maist of all, that hes my bailis bred, To heir hou ?e, on that syde of the m[ure,] Birlis at the wyne, and blythlie gois to [bed;] For?etting me, pure pleuman, I am sure. So, sillie I, opprest with barmie jugg[is,] Invyis ?our state, that's pouing Bacchus [luggis.] LXVII. E?ECHIEL MONTG. ANSUEIR TO LADYLAND. Beloued brother, I haif sene ?our bill, And smyld to sie the Sonet that ?e send. I sie ?ow skornfull, thoght ?e haif no sk[ill,] Becaus to play the poet ?e pretend. Bot sen ?e craiv ?our cunning to be [kend,] Come on, companion; I becall ?our crak[s:] For all the poeme, pleuman, ?e haif pe[nd,] I am ouer sair for ?ou and other sax. To match Montgomerie, thoght a mint [thou maks,] Thou menes be me thy maich, and mair nor match; Hou beit thou brave vs, bour! behind our baks, No man invyis our weilfair, bot a wrech. Mell not with vs, vhose heads weirs l[aurel . . .] Our Muse drinks wyne, vhen thyn bot suims in suaits. If I haif shod ?ou strait, or on a vane, Gar Peter Barkley drau the naill agane. LXVIII. LADYLAND TO E?ECH. MONTG. Sir Icarus, ?our sonet I haiv sene, Nocht ignorant vhose bolt that bag come fro. ?e lent ?our name to feght against ?our frene, Till one durst neuir avou him self my fo. I mak a vou—and I heir ony mo Such campillmuts, ?e better hold ?ou still. ?e crak so crouse, I ken, becaus ?e'r tuo; Bot I am dour, and dou not want my will. Grou I campstarie, it may drau to ill; Thairfore it's good in tyme that we wer shed. My Bee's aloft, and daggit full of skill: It getts corne drink, sen Grissall toke the bed. Come on, good gossopis; let vs not discord; With Johne and George ?e must convoy my Lord. LXIX. THE OLD MAISTER To my old Maister, and his ?ong disciple; Tua bairnis of Beath, by Natur taught to tipple. The Lesbian Lad, that weirs the wodbind w[reath,] With Ceres and Cylenus, gled ?our ging. Be blyth, Kilbvrnie, with the Bairns of Be[ath;] And let Lochwinnoch Lordie lead ?our ri[ng.] Be mirrie men; feir God, and serve the K[ing;] And cair not by Dame Fortuns fead a fl[ea;] Syne, welcome hame, suete Semple, sie ?e [sing;] Gut ouer, and let the wind shute in the [sea.] I, Richie, Jane, and George are lyk to [dee;] Four crabit crippilis crackand in our crouch. Sen I am trensh-man for the other thri[e,] Let drunken Pancrage drink to me in D[utch.] Scol frie, al out, albeit that I suld brist Ih wachts, hale beir, fan hairts and nych [sum] drist. LXX. AGAINST THE GOD OF LOVE. Blind brutal Boy, that with thy bou abuses Leill leisome love by lechery and lust, Judge, jakanapis and jougler maist vnj[ust,] If in thy rageing resone thou refuises; To be thy chiftanes changers ay thou chuisis To beir thy baner, so they be robust. Fals tratur, Turk, betrayer vnder trust, Quhy maks thou makrels of the modest Muses? Art thou a god? No—bot a gok disguysit; A bluiter buskit lyk a belly blind, With wings and quaver waving with the wind; A plane playmear for vanitie devysit. Thou art a stirk, for all thy staitly stylis; And these, good geese, vhom sik a god begylis. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. I. A DESCRIPTION OF TYME. Tak tyme in tym, or tym will not be tane; Thairfor tak tent hou thou this tyme suld tak: Sho hes no hold, to hold hir by, bot ane; A toppe befor, bot beld behind hir bak. Let thou hir slippe, or slipperly grou slak, Thou gettis no grippe agane fra sho be gane. If thou wald speid, remember vhat I spak; Tak tyme in tyme, or tym will not be tane. For I haif hard in adagies of auld, That tyme dois waist and weir all things auay; Then trou the taill that treu men oft hes tauld— A turne in tyme is ay worth other tuay. Siklyk, I haif hard oft-tymis suith men say, That negligence ?it nevir furtherit nane; Als, seindle tymis luck foloues long delayis. Tak tyme in tyme, or tyme will not be tane. II. THE OPPOSITIONE OF THE COURT TO CONSCIENCE The Court and Conscience wallis not weill; These tua can nevir weill accord. Quha leivis in Court and halds him leill, Lang or that lyf mak him a lord; And Conscience sten?ies if he steill: So Court and Conscience walis not weill. The Court some qualities requyrs Quhilk Conscience can not bot accuse; And, specially, sik as aspyris Mon honest adulation wse; I dar not say, and doubly deill: Bot Court and Conscience wals not weill. First thou mon preis thy Prince to pleis, Thought contrare Conscience he commands, With Mercuris mouth, and Argos eis, And with Briarius hundreth hands; And seme vhatsoever he sayis to seill. So Court and Conscience wallis not weill. Syn evirie minioun thou man mak To gar thame think that thou art thairs, Houbeit thou be behind thair bak No furtherer of thair effairs, Bot mett thame moonshyn ay for meill. So Court and Conscience wallis not weill. To pleis men vhen thou art imployde, Give glorifluikims in thair face; Quhilks wald be cunningly convoyde, To gar thame haif the griter grace, To mak thame fonde that hes no feill. So Court and Conscience walis not weill. III. ANE INVECTIONE AGAINST FORTUN; Conteining ane Admonitione to his Friends at Court. Not Clio nor Calliope I chuse; Megera, thou must be my mirthles Muse, For to inspyre my spreit with thy despyte, And with thy fervent furie me infuse, Quhat epithets or arguments till vse, With fals and fein?ed Fortun for to flyte. Both wey my words and waill my verse to wry[te,] That curst inconstant cative till accuse, Quhais variance of all my wois I wyt. Sho is mair mobile mekle nor the mone: It keeps a course, and changis not so sone, Bot in ane ordour waxis ay and wanis; Sing sho tua notis, the one is out of tone, As B acre lau and B moll far abone: In mesur not a moment sho remanes. Sho givis by gesse; sho weyis no gold by granes. Hir doings all ar vndiscreitly done, Without respect of persons or of pains. For men of merit sho no mater maks: Bot vhen a toy intill hir heid sho taks, But ryme or reson or respect to richt, The worthiest and valiantest sho wraks, And honours out-waills for wnworthie acts; As of a kitchin knaive to mak a knicht. That witch, that warlok, that vnworthie wic[ht] Turnis ay the best men tittest on thair bakis; Syn settis vp sik as somtym war bot slycht. Quhen with a quhisk sho quhirlis about hir quheill, Rude is that rattill running with a reill, Quhill top ouer tail goes honest men atains. Then spurgald sporters they begin to speill; The cadger clims, neu cleikit from the creill; And ladds vploips to lordships all thair lains: Doun goes the bravest, brecking al their banis. Sho works hir will; God wot if it be weill. Sho stottis at strais, syn stumbillis not at stanis. How sho suld hurt or help sho neuer huiks. Luk as it lyks, sho laughis and neuer luiks, Bot wavers lyk the widdircok in wind. Sho counts not kings nor ca?ards mair nor cuiks. Reid bot hou scho hes bleckit Bocas buiks: Thairin the fall of princes sall ?e find. That bloodie bitch, that buskit belly blind Dings dounuards ay the duchtiest lyk duiks: Quha hopped highest oft tyms comes behind. I neid not nou to nominat thair names Quhom sho hes shent, and dayly shifts and shames; That longsome labour wold be ouer prolixt: ?our selfis may sie, I think, a thousand thames Quhilks poets, as hir pursevants, proclames. Hir fickle freindship is not firmely fixt: Quhair ane is nou his nichtbour may be nixt. Sho causles cul?ies, and but falt defames; Hir mirrines with missheif ay is mixt. Thairfor, my freinds vha nevir feirs to fall, Resaiv my eirnest admonition all. Quhillis ?e ar weill I wish ?ou to be war. Remember, shirs, that somtym ?e war small; And may be ?it: I will not say ?e sall; For, I confes, that war a fut too far. Houbeit ?e think my harrand something har, Quhen ?e leist wein, ?our baks may to the wall. Things byds not ay in ordour as they ar. Tak tyme in tyme, and to my taill tak tent; Let ?e it pass, perhaps, ?e may repent, And wish it war, vhen ?e may want ?our will. Had Cæsar sene the cedul that wes sent, ?e wat he had not with the wicked went, Quha war concludit causles him to kill: Bot in his bosome he put vp that bill; The vhilk at last, thoght lait, maid him repent: His vnadvertence only did him ill. Judge of ?our self by Julius, my joyes, Quhais fen?eid freinds wer worse then open foes, If that ?e stand not in a stagring stait. Think ?e that sho will thole ?ou more nor those Quha war ?our auin compan?ons, I suppose, Quhom sho gart slyde, or ?e sat on thair seat? Some got a blind, vho thoght they war not bleat. Chuse or refuse my counsel; tak ?our chose. Fairweill, my freinds, I bot with fortun fleat. IV. THE POETS COMPLAINT OF HIS NATIVITIE. Since that the Hevins are hinderers of my hap, And all the starris so strange against me stand, Quhy kild not Jove me with his thunder clap, Hou soon the midwyfe held me in hir hand? Quhy wald not Mercure with his wrethin wand Depryve me baith of senses, wit, and shape, Since that the Hevins ar hinderers of my hap? Quhy thoild my mothers bouels me to breath? Quhy wes hir belly not my bureall bed? Quhy wes not hir delyverie my death? Quhy suelt I not, so soon as we wer shed? Quhy come the Muses and my cradle cled? Quhat movit these Vestal Virgins me to wrap, Since that the Hevins ar hinderers of my hap? Quhy wes my mother blyth vhen I wes borne? Quhy heght the Weirds my weilfair to advance? Quhy wes my birth on Eister day at morne? Quhy did Apollo then appeir to dance? Quhy gaiv he me good morou with a glance? Quhy leugh he in his golden chair and lap, Since that the Hevins ar hinderers of my hap? Quhy had he me to Helicon to heive? Quhy wes I novece to the Nobles nyne? Quhy did the gods for godbarne-gift me geive Ambrosian bread and hevinly nectar wyn, To quintessence a goldin grave ingyne, Both for invention and for uttrance apt, Since that the Hevins ar hinderers of my hap? Quhy wes I nurisht with the noble Nymphs? Quhy wes I fostred for to flie with fame? For drinking of these Ladyis hallouit lymphs, Extold among y? rare men wes my name. Quhy did Apollo Poet me proclame, To cleith my heid with his grene laurell cap, Since that the Hevins ar hinderers of my hap? Quhat helpeth me, thought Maia or Minerve With hevinly fury haif my spreit infusde? Quhat do these sacred ceremonies serve, Quhilks they haif on thair auin adoptit wsde? Quhat profits me vhom fortun hes refusde, Thoght with my king in credit once I crap, Since that the Hevins ar hinderers of my hap? Quhy wes my will to vertue mair then vyce? Quhy wes I faithfull, and refusde to fane? Quhy soght I aye warme water vnder yce, Quhair wylis availls and veritie is vane? Forgive me this, and if I do it agane, Then tak me with the foxis taill a flap, Since that the Hevins are hinderers of my hap. V. THE POETS COMPLANTE AGAINST THE WNKYNDNES OF HIS COMPANIONS VHEN HE WES IN PRISONE. No wonder thoght I waill and weip, That womplit am in woes; I sigh, I sobbe, vhen I suld sleep; My spreit can not repose. My persone is in prisone pynit, And my companions so vnkind, Melancholie mischeivis my mind, That I can not rejose. So long I lookit for releif, Vhill trewlie nou I tyre; My guttis ar grippit so with grief, It eitis me vp in yre. The fremmitnes that I haif felt, For syte and sorrou garris me suelt, And maks my hairt within me melt Lyk waxe befor the fyre. Quhen men or wemen visitis me, My dolour I disguyse; By outuard sight that nane may sie Quhair inward langour lyis. Als patient as my pairt appeirs, With hevy hairt, vhen no man heirs, For baill then burst I out in teirs, Alane with cairfull cryis. All day I wot not vhat to do, I loth to sie the licht; At evin then I am trublit, to; So noysum is the nicht. Quhen Natur most requyrs to rest, With pansing so I am opprest, So mony things my mynd molest, My sleiping is bot slicht. Remembring me vhair I haif bene Both lykit and belovt, And nou sensyne vhat I haif sene, My mynd may be commovt. If any of my dolour dout, Let ilkane sey thair tym about: Perhaps vhois stomok is most stout, Its patience may be provt. I sie, and namely nou a dayis, All is not gold that gleitis; Nor to be seald that ilkane sayis; Nor water all that weitis. Sen fristed goods ar not forgivin, Quhen cuppe is full, then hold it evin; For man may meit at unsetstevin, Thoght montanis nevir meitis. Then do as ?ee wald be done to, Belouit brethren all; For, out of doubt, quhat so ?e do, Resaiv the lyk ?e sall. And with quhat mesur ?e do mett, Prepair again the lyk to gett. ?our feet ar not so sicker sett, Bot fortun ?e may fall. VI. A LATE REGRATE OF LEIRNING TO LOVE. Quhat mightie motione so my mynd mischeivis? Quhat vncouth cairs throu all my corps do creep? Quhat restles rage my resone so bereivis? Quhat maks me loth of meit, of drink, of sleep? I knou not nou vhat countenance to keep For to expell a poysone that I prove. Alace! alace! that evir I leirnd to love. A frentick fevir thrugh my flesh I feill; I feill a passione can not be exprest; I feill a byll within my bosum beill; No cataplasme can weill impesh that pest. I feill my self with seiknes so possest, A madnes maks my mirth from me remove. Alace! alace! that evir I learnd to love. My hopeles hairt, vnhappiest of hairts, Is hoild and hurt with Cupids huikit heeds, And thirlit throu with deidly poysond dairts, That inwardly within my breist it bleids. ?it fantasie my fond affection feeds To run that race but ather rest or rove. Alace! alace! that evir I leirnd to love. Nou sie I that I nevir sau afore; Nou knou I that, vhill nou, I nevir kneu; Nou sie I weill that servitude is sore: Bot vhat remeid? It is no tym to reu; Quhair Love is Lord, all libertie adeu. My baill is bred by destinies above. Alace! alace! that evir I leirnd to love. All gladnes nocht bot aggravats my grief; All mirrines my murning bot augments. Lamenting toons best lyks me for relief, My sicknes soir to sorou so consents; For cair the cairfull commounly contents; Sik harmony is best for thair behove. Alace! alace! that evir I leirnd to love. I felt, fra anis I entred in that airt, A grit delyte that leson for to leir, Quhill I become a prentise ouer expert; For, but a book, I cund it soon perqueir. My doctours wage and deuty will be deir, I grant, except I get hir jelous glove. Alace! alace! that evir I leirnd to love. VII. A COUNSELL AGANST DISPAIR IN LOVE. Drie furth the inch as thou hes done the span, My gentle hairt, and die not in dispair. I sheu the first vhen thou to love began, It wes no moues to mell with Loves lair. Thou wald not ceis till thou wes in that snair: Think of it nou as thou thoght of it than: With patience thou mayst thy self prepair To drie the inch as thou hes done the span. Quhat meins thou nou fra thou be in hir waird? Thy libertie, alace! it is to lait. Except hir grace thou hes no other gaird. Thair is no chose, for nou thou art chekmait. Thair is no draught that dou mak the debait. Thou art inclosde, for all the craft thou can. With patience persaiv thy auin estait: Drie furth the inch as thou hes done the span. The mair thou grudgis, the griter is thy grief. The mair thou sighis, the mair thou art ouirsett. The mair thou loipis, the les is thy relief. The mair thou flings, the faster is the net. The mair thou feghts, the mair thou art defett. The mair behind, the faster that thou ran. Tak patience, sen dolour peyis no dett: Drie furth the inch as thou hes done the span. ?it werie not, thoght of thy will thou want. I am assuird that shortly thou sall sie Thy Love and Lady grace vnto the grant, Sa far as may stand with hir honestie— Hir gentlenes and hir humanitie War advocats till thou thy proces wan— Provyding aluayis thou suld stedfastly Drie furth the inch as thou hes done the span. Then mak thy self als mirrie as thou may; The tyme may come thou longis for so fast. Rome wes not biggit all vpon ane day, And ?it it wes compleitit at the last. Of all thy pains account the perrils past; For vhy? sho is not come of Cresseids clan. Be glade, thairfor, and be no more agast: Drie furth the inch as thou hes done the span. O noblest nymph of Naturs nurishing! O most excellent only A per se! O fairest flour in firmnes florishing! O treuest turtle, root of constancie! O worthie wicht both wyse and womanlie! O myn but mo! shau mercy to thy man, To plesur him vho dois so patiently Drie furth the inch as he hes done the span. VIII. ECHO. To the, Echo, and thou to me agane, In the deserts among the wods and wells, Quhair destinie hes bund [the] to remane, But company within the firths and fells, Let vs complein, with wofull ?outs and ?ells, On shaft and shooter that our hairts hes slane: To the, Echo, and thou to me agane. Thy pairt to mine may justlie be compaird In mony poynts, vhilk both we may repent, Thou hes no hope, and I am clene dispaird; Thou tholis but caus, I suffer innocent; Thou does bewaill, and I do still lament; Thou murns for nocht, I shed my teirs in vane: To the, Echo, and thou to me agane. Thou pleins Narcissus, I my love also; He did the hurt, bot I am kild by myne; He fled from the, myne is my mortall fo, Without offence, and crueller nor thyne. The Weirds vs baith predestinat to pyne, Continually to others to complane: To the, Echo, and thou to me agane. Thou hyds thyself; I list not to be sene; Thou banisht art, and I am in exyle— By Juno thou, and I by Venus Quene. Thy love wes fals, and myn did me begyle; Thou hoped once, so wes I glaid a vhyle; ?it lost our tyme in love, I will not lane: To the, Echo, and thou to me agane. Thy elrish skirlis do penetrat the roks; The roches rings, and rendirs me my cryis. Our saikles plaints to pitie thame provoks, Quhill they compell our sounds to pierce the skyis. All thing bot love to plesur vs applyis, Quhais end, alace! I say is bot disdane: To the, Echo, and thou to me agane. Som thing, Echo, thou hes for to rejose, Suppose Narcissus some tyme the forsook. First he is dead, syne changed in a rose, Quhom thou nor nane hes pouer for to brook. Bot, be the contrair, evirie day I look To sie my love attraptit in a trane From me, Echo, and nevir come agane. Nou welcome, Echo, patience perforce. Anes eviry day, with murning, let vs meet. Thy love nor myne in mynds haif no remorse; We taist the sour that nevir felt the sueet. As I demand, then ansueir and repeit. Let teirs aboundant ouir our visage rane: To the, Echo, and thou to me agane. Quhat lovers, Echo, maks sik querimony? Mony. Quhat kynd of fyre doth kindle thair curage? Rage. Quhat medicine, (O Echo! knouis thou ony?) Ony? Is best to stay this Love of his passage? Age. Quhat merit thay that culd our sigh assuage? Wage. Quhat wer we first in this our love profane? Fane. Quhair is our joy? O Echo! tell agane. Gane! IX. [ADDRESS TO LOVE.] Blind Love! if euer thou made bitter sueet, Or turnd the sugar to the taist of gall, Or ?it dissolvit a frostie hairt with heet; If on thyn altar sacrifice I sall, As to the Lord of Love vho may do all, Vhois pouer maks the stoutest stomoks ?eeld, And waikest somtyme for to win the feeld; If thou can brek ane allabaster breist, Or if no sheeld be shotfrie vhare thou shoots, Let not thy lau be lichtleit, at the leist, Bot tak revenge vhen rebels thee reboots. If thou be he of vhom so mony moots, Quha maks the hardiest flintie harts to melt, And beirs thame ay about the lyk a belt; Or if thou be that archer so renound, That vhair thou mints thou missis not the mark, Bot, lyk a king, is for thy conqueis cround, To vhom all stoupis, thoght they war neuer so s[tark;] If of thy fyr be resting ?it a spark, I pray thee, nou, thy cunning for to kyth, And burne hir breist that of my baill is blyth. X. A DESCRIPTIONE OF VANE LOVERS. Nane lovis bot fools vnolvd agane, Quha tyns thair tyme and comis no speid. Mak this a maxime to remane, That Love beirs nane bot fools at feid; And they get ay a good goosheid In recompense of all thair pane. So of necessitie mon succeid, Nane lovis bot fools, vnlovd agane. ?e wot a wyse man will be war, And will not ventur but advyse. Greit fuills, for me, I think they ar, That seeks warme water vnder yce. ?it some mair wilfull ar nor wyse, That for thair lovis saik wold be slane. Buy on repentance of that pryce: Nane lovis bot fools, vnlovd agane. Thoght some we sie, in evry age, Lyk glaikit fools, gang gooked gaits, Quhair reson gets no place for rage, They love best them vhilk thame bot haits, Syne of thair folies wyts the Faits, As Destinie did thame disdane; Quhilks are bot cappit vane conceats: Nane loves bot fools, vnlovd agane. Some by ane proverbe fane wald prove, Quha skantly nevir sau the scuills, That love with resone is no love, Nor constance, vhare occasion cools. Thair they confes, lyk frantick fools, That wilfully thay will be vane. But resone what ar men bot mulis? Nane lovis bot fools, vnlovd agane. They speik not leirnd-lyk, at the leist, That rage, in steid of reson, ruisis: Vhat better ar they nor a beist, Fra tym that reson thame refuisis? Some beistlily thamselfis abusis, As constancie did them constrane; Quhilks ar bot ignorant excusis: Nane lovis bot fools, vnlovd agane. For ding a dog, and he will byte, And fan on him vha givis him fude; And can as caus requyrs acquyt, As ill with ill, and good with good. Than love nane bot vhare thou art lude, And vhar thou finds tham faynd refrane; Tak this my counsell: I conclude, Nane lovis bot fools, vnlovd agane. XI. THE WELL OF LOVE. Among the gods that sittis above, And ruleth in the skyis, That blindit boy, the god of love, All creatur espyis. Vha may withstand his stroke, I say, Quhen he list for to shute? For to reveill I minted ay; Bot yet it was no bute. Fra tym that winged god did sie That I did love disdane, He took a shaft and shot at me And peirsit evirie vane. The head so deeply in me sank, That all my body brist; Then of the well of Love I drank, To quench my burning thrist. So soon as I thairof did taist, My breist began to burne; Then to the gods of love, in haist, My visage did I turne, With trimbling teirs, vpon my knees, My pains for to deploir; Then they did open vp my ees, Quhilk long wer shut before. Quhen that my dimmit sight greu cleir, Incontinent I sau A palice stand before me neir; And thidder did I drau For to refresh my werynes, Quhilk I susteind before: Bot then my pains they did incres, And vexd me more and more. Into that place I sau repair Of nymphis mony a one; Lyk burning gold thair glistering hair Thair shulders hang vpon. Amongst thame one I sau appeir, Quhilk did excell thame all; Lyk Venus with hir smyling cheir That wan the goldin ball. Hir deasie colour, rid and vhyte, Lyk lilies on the laik; Hir glistring hair, of grit delyte, Behind hir nek did shaik. Of diamonds hir ees were maid, That in hir heid did stand; With armis long, and shulders braid, And middle small as wand. Fra I beheld hir beuty bright, I had no strenth to steir; I wes so woundit with that sight, That I micht not reteir. The gods of love reliev my pain, And caus hir for to reu! For nou the fyre of love agane Is in me kindlit neu. O happie war that man indeid, Quha micht hir love obtene! For hir my thirlit hairt does bleid; Sair vexit is my splene. Sen I haif lost my libertie, In bondage for to duell, God give hir grace to reu on me, And meit me at the well! XII. OF THE SAME WELL. To the, O Cupid! king of love, We pray, whair thou does duell, That, but respect, thou wold remove All rebells from thy well: And if to drink they haif desyre This water; then, thou turne Into the element of fyre, With baill thair breist to burne. And let thame, with Apollo, prove The fury of thy fyre; And let them haif no luk in love, Bot droun thame with desyre. Bot vnto vs that subjects ar To Love, and to his lauis, Mair mercifull I wald thou war, Nor ?it thy self thou shauis. As we do serve thy Celsitude, In hope to haif reuaird; Let thame, vhom we haif so long lude, Our service once regaird. XIII. THE COMMENDATIONE OF LOVE. I rather far be fast nor frie, Albeit I micht my mynd remove; My maistres hes a man of me, That lothis of euery thing bot love. Quhat can a man desyre, Quhat can a man requyre, Bot tym sall caus him tyre, And let it be, Except that fervent fyre Of burning love impyre? Hope heghts me sik a hyre, I rather far be fast nor frie. But love—vhat wer bot sturt or stryfe? But love—vhat kyndnes culd indure? But love—hou lothsum war our lyfe! But love—vhairof suld we be sure? But love—vhar wer delyt? But love—vhat bot despyt? But love—vhat wer perfyt? Sure suld we sie. But love—vhat war to wryt? But love—vha culd indyt? No—nothing worth a myte: I rather far be fast nor frie. Love maks men gla?ard in thair geir; Love maks a man a martial mynd; Love maks a man no fortun feir; Love changes natur contrare kynd. Love maks a couard kene; Love maks the clubbit clene; Love maks the niggard bene; That—vho bot he? Love maks a man, I mene, Mair semely to be sene; Love keeps ay curage grene: I rather far be fast nor frie. Love can not be, bot from above, Quhilk halds the hairt so quik in heit. Fy on that freik that can not love! He hes not worth a sponk of spreit. Remember ony man, In chronikle, ?e can, That ever worship wan, But love, let sie, And once that rink he ran. Sen this is treu—vhy than, I end as I began: I rather far be fast nor frie. XIV. [AGAINST LOVE.] I rather far be frie nor fast; I hope I may remove my mynd; Love is so licht, it can not last; It is smal pleasur to be pynd; Sen I haif ees tuo, What need I blindlings go, Ay fundring to and fro, Quhill clods me cast? I am not one of tho, To work my wilfull wo; I shaip not to do so: I rather far be frie nor fast. But libertie—what micht me meis? But libertic—all things me grieve. But libertie—vhat might me pleis? But libertie—I loth to leive. But libertie—alace! Hou cairfull wer my case! But libertie—my grace And joy wer past. Suppose I, for a space, War captive in a place, I reu that rekles race: I rather far be frie nor fast. Of prisone fredome brings me furth: My fredome maks contentment kyth: But fredome all things war no worth: My fredome maks me glade and blyth: My fredome maks me fain: In mirth vhair I remain, I pas the tym but pain, And vnagast. Quharas I purpose plain, From folies to refrain, Sen love hes syndrie slain: I rather far be frie nor fast. Love can not be bot very ill, That folk with fury so infects; Abusing manheid, wit, and skill, No ryme nor resone it respects, Bot ramping in a rage, Not sparing ony age Of ca?ard, king, nor page, Bot byds thair blast. Sen sik as suld be sage Ar korpit in that cage, I work not for sik wage: I rather far be frie nor fast. XV. [THE SOLSEQUIUM.] Lyk as the dum Solsequium, With cair ouercum, And sorou, vhen the sun goes out of sight, Hings doun his head, And droups as dead, And will not spread, Bot louks his leavis throu langour of the nicht, Till folish Phaeton ryse, With vhip in hand, To cleir the cristall skyis, And light the land: Birds in thair bour Luiks for that hour, And to thair prince ane glaid good-morou givis; Fra thyn, that flour List not to lour, Bot laughis on Phœbus lousing out his leivis: So fairis with me, Except I be Vhair I may se My lamp of licht, my Lady and my Love. Fra scho depairts, Ten thousand dairts, In syndrie airts, Thirlis throu my hevy hart, but rest or rove; My countenance declairs My inward grief; Good hope almaist dispairs To find relief. I die—I duyn— Play does me pyn— I loth on euiry thing I look—alace! Till Titan myne Vpon me shyne, That I revive throu favour of hir face. Fra she appeir [Into hir spheir,] Begins to cleir The dauing of my long desyrit day: Then Curage cryis On Hope to ryse, Fra he espyis My noysome nicht of absence worne auay. No wo, vhen I aualk, May me impesh; Bot, on my staitly stalk, I florish fresh. I spring—I sprout— My leivis ly out— My colour changes in ane hartsum heu. No more I lout, Bot stands vp stout, As glade of hir, for vhom I only greu. O happie day! Go not auay. Apollo! stay Thy chair from going doun into the west: Of me thou mak Thy zodiak, That I may tak My plesur, to behold vhom I love best. Thy presence me restores To lyf from d[eath;] Thy absence also shores To cut my breath. I wish, in vane, Thee to remane, Sen primum moblie sayis aluayis nay; At leist thy wane Turn soon agane. [Fareweill, with patience perforce, till day.] XVI. A REGRATE OF HARD LUCK IN LOVE. O vhat a martyrd man am I! I freat—I fry— I wreist—I wry— I wrassill with the wind; Of duill and dolour so I dry, And wot not vhy This grit invy Of Fortun nou I find; Bot at this tym hir spyt I spy: O vhat a martyrd man am I! Quhat pen or paper can expres The grit distres And hevynes, Quhilk I haif at my hairt? My comfort ay grouis les and les; My cairs incres With sik excess, I sigh, I sobbe, I smarte; So that I am compeld to cry, O vhat a martyrd man am I! With weping ees my verse I wryt, Of comfort quyt: Adeu delyt! My hairt is lyk the lead. Of all my sorou and my syte The Weirds I wyt, That span with spyt My thrauart fatall threid. God wat that barrat deir I buy: O vhat a martyrd man am I! Of ill befor I vnderstude, It had bene gude Into my cude, Bereiving me my breath, Nou to haif bene of noy denude, Quhilk boyllis my blude: Come ?it conclude My dolour, gentle Death; And lat me not in langour ly: O vhat a martyrd man am I! XVII. [ANE EXAMPLE FOR HIS LADY.] Quhen first Apollo Python sleu, Sa glorious that god he greu, Till he presumit to perseu The blindit archer boy; Quhais Turkie bou and quaver bleu, Quharin appeirit noks aneu, He bad him ?eild to him, as deu, Quha best culd thame imploy. Quod Cupid: “Shortly sall thou reu, That euer thou sik cunning kneu;” Syne to Parnassus fast he fleu, His shaft for to convoy. Thair he ane deidly dairt outdreu, At proud Apollo he it threu, Syn him a sight of Daphne sheu, Quhose beutie wroght him noy. ?it crabit Cupid, not content, Apollois anger to augment, Did nok agane incontinent, With fethers rugh, and all too rent, At Daphne slaulie doun he sent, Quhais frostie head, vhair so it went, Bedea?it evry vane. That winged archer insolent Did wound thame baith, bot different; Apollois harte to love he bent, Bot Daphnes to disdane. To lait Apollo did repent That he with Cupid wes acquent, Quha wilfullie did ay invent Hou to augment his pane. His hurt wes with the goldin heid, Quhilk inward in his hair did bleid; No medicin micht him remeid From Cupids angrie yre: Hirs with the blunted bolt of leid, Ane hevy mettall cauld and deid, Repelling love, as yce may reid, And quencher of desyre. His pain wes lyk the pyralide, A beist in birning that does breid, And in the fyry flammis dois feid, And fosters of the fyre. Cupido bare him so at feid, That in his love he come no speid: Both his persute and Daphnes dreid, To tell, my tongue suld tyre. About Penneus, did repair This noble nymph, of beuty rare; Quhais comely clothing to declare, My author does indyt. Most from the belt vp scho wes bair; Behind hir hang hir hevinly hair, Vnkamed hovring in the air, Shed from hir visage vhyt; With blinkis dulce and debonair Lyk beuties freshest florish, fair, Exemed clene from Loves lair, To work Apollo spyt. Hir countenance did move him mair, Quhen throu hir garments, heir and thair, Appeirit hir lustie limis square, As sho ran by him quyt. Quhen as he sau that Virgin flie, He folloude in a frenesie, And cryde: “O Daphne! deir to me, “Why does thou take the chace? “Go slau, and sie vha folouis thee— “Thy lover, and no enemie; “Nixt michtie Jove, into degrie, “I bruik the cheifest place; “And I sall stay my course,” quod he, “Leist thou resave some hurt from me: “Thou sees, thair is no remedie, “Bot thou must lose the race.” Sho prayd the gods hir helpers be, To saif hir pure virginitie; Quha shupe hir in a laurell trie, As he did hir embrace. Nou, lovesome lady, let vs leir Exemple of these ladyis heir; Sen Daphne boght hir love so deir, Hir fortun suld effray ?ou. Bot I haif no sik caus to feir, That obstinat ?e perseveir; On Lovis book, my self I sueir, ?our bundman, til obey ?ou. Then lyk Penelope appeir, Quha wes so constant tuenty ?eir: Quhen ?our Vlysses is not neir, Tentation may assay ?ou; ?it vary not, I ?ou requeir, And I sall stoppe Vlysses eir. Fairweill, my Love and Lady cleir; Be permanent, I pray ?ou. Finis. XVIII. NATUR PASSIS NURITURE. As Natur passis Nuriture, Of Natur all things hes a strynd; So evrie leving creature Ay covets comounly thair kynd: As buk the dae—the harte the hynd: Lyk drauis to lyk, we sie this sure; So I am aluayis of that mynd, That Natur passis Nuriture. Thoght Nuriture be of that strenth, To war the Natur vhylis a wie; ?it Natur ay prevailis at lenth, As by experience we sie; Except throu destinie it be In some; vhilk does not long indure. Vhat fortun will, may no man flie; Bot Natur passis Nuritur To prove this proverbe to be true, Difficultie, I think, is nane, By ald examplis past aneu, Quharof I mycht haif tuentie tane. Nou I will vse bot only ane, Quhilk lang within my breist I bure, And let the lave nou all alane; Hou Natur passis Nuriture. Thair wes a gentle girking gay, Of plesand plume, and fair of flicht, Quha wes so proud, vhen he wald pray, That he outsprang all halks for hight. He wes so lordly, for to light, He wald not look vpon a lure; Bot fleu, ay soaring, out of sight, As Natur passis Nuriture. The falconis folouit vhair he fleu; To fang his friendship they war fane Quharof so glorious he greu, That he thair offers did disdane; Quhilks vhen they sau they wroght in vane, The formels fair auay they fure. Ingratitude gets sik agane, As Natur passis Nuriture. This girking pearkit in a place, Quharin ouer long he did delyt; Quhill, at the last, throu love, alace! He come acquantit with a kyt, And quat his auld acquentance quyt. Of his oun kynd he took no cure: Wo worth the Weirds that had the wyt That Natur ?eildt to Nuriture! Fra once hir company he vsit, He greu so goked with that gled; Blind love his reson so abvsit, He suore that they suld neuer shed. Fra sho with fedrit flesh wes fed, Quhilk prayd befor on poddoks pure, With tym sho tystit him to tred: Thair Natur ?eildt to Nuriture. Hir meit of modeuarts and myce, He changed in partridge, and in pout. ?it Natur, nottheles, is nyce: Thair brald a bissat neir about, Quhilk vsd hir, vhen the halk fleu out, Suppose they held it long obscure. Do vhat ?e dou, thair is no doubt Bot Natur passis Nuriture. Thair companie [it] wes not quyet, Bot or they wist they wer beuryde; And that throu pearking of a pyet Besyde thame, vhilk thair palks espyde. To tell the halk, in haist sho hyde, The kyt wes pal?ard and perjure. The tersel troude not, vhill he tryde, That Natur passis Nuriture. XIX. [ADDRESS TO THE SUN.] Quhill as with vhyt and nimble hand, My maistres gathring flours doth stand, Amidst the florisht meid; Of lilies vhyt, and violets, A garland properly sho plets, To set vpon hir heid. O Sun! that shynis so bright above, If euer thou the fyre of love Hes felt, as poets fayne— If it be sik—as sik it semes, Of courtessie withdrau thy bemes, Leist thou hir colour stayne. She, if thou not hir beutie burne, Sall quyt thee with a better turne, To close hir cristall ees— A brightnes far surmounting thyne, Leist thou, thairby ashamd, suld tyne Thy credit in the skyis. XX. [EVEN DEAD BEHOLD I BREATH.] Evin dead behold I breath! My breath procures my pane; Els dolour, eftir death, Suld slaik, vhen I war slane: Bot destinies disdane So span my fatall threid, But mercy, to remane A martyr, quik and deid. O fatall deidly feid! O rigour but remorse! Since thair is no remeid, Come patience, perforce. My hairt, but rest or rove, Reuth, reson, or respect, With fortun, death, and love, Is keipit under check; That nou thair is no nek, Nor draught to mak debate, Bot let it brist or brek; For love must haif it mait. Relief, alace! is lait, Quhen I am bund to flie: I stand in strange estate; I duyn and dou not die. The Faits—the thrauard Faitis, The wicked Weirds hes wroght My state, of all estates, Vnhappiest to be thoght. Had I offendit oght, Or wroght aganst thair will, But mercy, than they moght Conclvde my corps to kill: Bot, as they haif no skill Of gude, nor ?it regard, The innocent, with ill, Ressaves the lyk reuard. ?it tyme sall try my treuth, And panefull patient pairt. Thoght love suld rage but reuth, And death with deidly dairt Suld sey to caus me smart; Nor fortuns fickill vheill— All suld not change my hairt, Quhilk is als true as steill. I am not lyk ane eill; To slippe, nor ?et to slyde. Love, fortun, death, fairueill, For I am bound to byd. XXI. [LOVE, IF THOU LIST.] Love, if thou list, I pray the let me leiv; Devoir me not, withdrau thy deidly dairt. Quhat right or resone hes thou to bereiv Me, wofull wretch, of my vnhappie hairt? Thy fyre, through yre, My bailfull bosome burnis. Quhat gloir the moir Vnto thy trophee turnis? To prove on me thy pith, Ane innocent, but ill, That ?oldin am in will, If thou thy captive kill, I dou not do thairwith. O Reson! thou regards not to be reft; Weill I persaiv thy pairt is to reprove: Quhy hes thou me alone in langour left? Delyvring me vnto this lokman Love, Vhose strenth at lenth Sall shuff the by the skaith; That I deir buy And thou be banisht baith; Quhilk sore we may repent. Fra thou be in exyle, That boy will me beguyll. O! waryit be the vhyle That euer we wer acquent! Quhen I wes lous, at libertie I lap; I leugh vhen ladyis spak to me of love; To hald me sa, alace! I had no hap, Bot purposly I wald gang pastym prove. I thoght I moght, But perrell, pas the tym; Fra hand, I fand My fethers in the lyme. Quhair I took leist regaird, And lothest wes to look, Bot seimd that I forsook, Sho had me on hir hook: O! welcome, just reuard! My pane is bot hir pastyme and hir play. As fyr I burne—lyk yce scho is als cauld: I sie, the man wha will not vhen he may, The tym sall come, he sall not vhen he wald. I sie in me This proverbe to be true; Quha wald not hald Me frie, vhilk I may reu; Bot proudly wald presume, And ha?ard to come speid. Quhen gone is all remeid, Dispair will be my deid: I sie nane other dome. XXII. [IN THROU THE WINDOES OF MYN EES.] In throu the windoes of myn ees— A perrillous and open pairt— Hes Cupid hurt my hevy hairt, Quhilk daylie duyns, bot nevir dees, Throu poyson of his deidly dairt. I bad him bot to sey ane shot; I smyld to se that suckling shute: “Boy, with thy bou do vhat thou dou,” Quod I, “I cair the not a cute.” “Fell peart,” quod Cupid, “thou appeirs;” Syn to his bou he maid a braid, And shot me soon be I had said; Quhill all my laughter turnd to teirs. “Now gesse,” quod he, “if thou be glaid; Nou laugh at Love, that pastym prove: Am I ane archer nou or nocht?” His skorne and skaith, I baid them baith, And got it sikker that I socht. Fra hand I frei?d in flamis of fyre; I brint agane als soon in yce: My dolour wes my auin devyce; Displesur wes my auin desyre. All thir by natur nou ar nyce; Bot Natur nou, I wot not how Sho meins to metamorphose me, In sik a shappe as hes no happe To further weill, nor ?it to flie. Quhen I wes frie, I micht haif fled; I culd not let this love allane: Nou, out of tym, vhen I am tane, I seik some shift that we may shed, Becaus it byts me to the bane. Bot, pruif is plane, I work in vane, It war bot mouis thairat to mint: Fra I be fast, that pairt is past; My tym and travell war baith tint. Micht I my Ariadne move, To lend hir Theseus a threed, Hir leilest lover for to leed Out of the laberinth of love; Then wer I out of dout of deed. Bot sho, alace! knauis not my cace; Hou can I then the better be? Quhill I stand au, my self to shau, The Minotaur does murdr[e me.] Go once, my longsome looks, reveill My secrete to my lady sueet; Go, sighs and teirs, for me intreet, That sho, by sympathie, may feill Pairt of the passionis of my spreet. Than, if hir grace givis pitie place, Ineugh; or, covets sho to [kill,] Let death dispetch my lyf, puir wretch! I wold not live aganst hi[r will.] XXIII. [IF FAITHFULNES SULD FRIENDSHIP FIND.] If faithfulnes suld friendship find— If patience suld purches pitie place— If resone love with bands micht bind— If service gude suld guerdond be with grace— If loving all for ane— If loving hir allane Suld recompence resave; Sen tym hes tryde my treuth, If rigour reiv not reuth, Quhat neids thou, Cupid, all thir dairts, Me to ouirthrou, that els am cum thy thrall? Thought I had had ane hundreth hairts, Long syne my lady had bereft thame all. Since that a hairtles man Mak na resistance can, Quhat worship can ?e win? To slay me ouer agane, That am alredy slane! That war baith shame and sin. To vhom suld I preis to appeill, To seik redres, if thou wold wark me wrong? It is too dangerous to deall, Or stryve with ane vhom I persave too strong. Far rather had I ?eild, Nor feght and tyn the feild. Vnequal is that match, Ane captive with a king; If euir I thoght sik thing, Forgive me wofull wretch! Quhair I haif recklest, I recant; In tyms to cum, I promise to be true. Laith wes I to begin, I grant, To love; bot nou my reklesnes I rue. Ouir rashly I rebeld, Quhill Cupid me compeld, Quhais force I find thairfor. Will he my ?ongnes ?it With mercy once remit, I trou to faill no more. XXIV. [LYK AS AGLAUROS.] Lyk as Aglauros, curious to knau Vhat Mercurie inclosit within the creell, Suppose defendit, ceist not till sho sau The serpent chyld, that Juno causit to steell, Quhilk, to hir sisters willing to reveill, Or sho wes war, evin with the word, anone Sho wes transformit in a marble stone:— Or [lyk as Psyche,] by her Mother movd Hir sleeping Cupid secreitly to sie, Resavd the lamp to look him vhom sho lovd; Quhais hevenly beautie blindt hir amorous ee, That sho for?et to close the lamp, till he In wrath auok, and fleu sho wist not vhair, And left his deing lover in dispair:— Euen so am I. O, wareit be my weird, For wondring on a deitie divyne— The idee of perfectione in this eird! Quhilk sorie sight oft gart me sigh sensyne. I sau tua sunnis in semicircle shyne, Compelling me to play Actæons pairt, And be transformd into a bloody hairt. For lurking Love, vha lang had lyne in wait, Persaving tym, he took me at a stot; Fra he beheld me broudin on the bait, He tuik a shaft, and suddently me shot; Quhais fyrie heid brint in my harte so hot, I gave a grone as I had givin the ghost; And, with a look, my liberty I lost. My qualities incontinent did change; For I, that som tyme solide wes and sage, Begouth to studie, stupefact and strange, Bereft of resone, reaving in a rage. No syrops sueet my sorou culd assuage; For cruell Cupid, to revenge his wroth, First made me love, and syn my lady loth. Lo, I, that leugh in liberty at Love, And thoght his furie bot a feckles freet, Am nou compeld that pastym for to prove, Quharof the sour, I sie, exceeds the sueet. That poysond pest perplexis so my spreet, I sitt and sighis all soliter and sad, Half mangd in mynd, almost as I war mad. Meit, drink, and sleip, and company I hait; I leive most lyk ane [eremite] allone: Bot, as the buk, vhare he is bund, mon blait, Becaus delyverance he persaifis none; So must I needs nou mak my mirthles mone, And wair my words, with weiping, all in vane, Quhair nane, bot Echo, ansueirs me agane. Hir modest looks, with majestie so mixt, Bad me be war, if I had not bene blind; Hir purpose grave, more pithie nor prolixt, Prognosticat my wrasling with the wind: ?it foolish I, vhose folie nou I find, Forcit by affectione, sau not vhat I soght; Bot negligence, alace! excuisis nocht. So long as I my secreit smart conceild, It seimd I wes a gaituard in hir grace; Bot, welauay, hou soon it wes reveild, Then I persaivit that pitie had no place. Hou soon sho kneu my languishing, allace! I gat comand hir company to quyt, And not to send hir nather word nor wryt. O sentence sharpe! too suddan and seveir; O bailfull bidding! bitter to obey; O wareit orange! willed me to weir; O wofull absence! ordande me for ay. O duilfull dume! delyvrit but delay; The worst is ill, if ?e be bot the best; I grant ?e ar weill grevous to digest. Proud ee, that looked not befor thou lap, Distill thy teirs of murning evermair. Proud hart! vhilk ha?ardt vhair thou had no [hap,] To drie thy penance patiently prepair. Cast of thy comfort; cleith thy self with [cair;] Sen thou art thrald, think thou mon thole a thr[ist:] To plesur hir thou may be blyth to brist. XXV. THE SACRIFICE OF CUPID. Hou oft throu compass of the christall skyis— Hou oft throu voyd and watrie vaults of air— Hou oft throu cluds vhair exhalations lyis— Hou oft, Cupido, vnto thyn auin repair, For sacrifice, haif I sent sighing sair, Accompanied with sharpe and bitter teirs? Hou oft haif I—thou knauis hou, vhen, and vhair— Causd my complante ascend into thy eirs? Suppose thou sees not, ?it I hope thou heirs, Or otherwyse, but dout, I suld dispair. Releiv my breist, that sik a burthen beirs, And thou sall be my maister evermair; And I sall be thy seruand, in sik sort To merit thy mantenance, if I may. My pen thy princely pussance sall report: ?ea, I sall on thyn alter, evrie day, Tua turtle dous, for ane oblatione, lay; A pair of pigeons, vhyt as ony flour; A harte of wax; a branch of myrhe; and ay The blood of sparouis thairon sprinkle and pour. ?ea, I sall, for thyn honour, evrie hour, In songs and sonets sueetly sing and say, Tuyse or atanes, “Vive, vive l'amour!” And sa my voues I promise for to pay. Triumphantly thy trophee sall I trim; Quhair I sall brave and gallant buitings bring, And wryt thairon: “Behold the spoills of him Quha, for his conqueis, may be calde a king.” My happy harte thair highest sall I hing, In signe that thou by victorie it wan; A rubie rich, within a royal ring, Quhilk first I got vhen I to love began. Als willing nou, as I ressavt it than, To thee my self, with service, I resigne. Quhat wald a maister wish mair of his man, Then till obey his thoght in evry thing? Bot, oh! as one that in a rageing ravis, Bereft of baith his resone and his rest, Compeld to cry, bot knauis not vhat he craivis, Impatient throu poysone of his pest: So do I nou, mair painfully opprest, Hope help at him, vhais help culd nevir heall, Bot, be the contrair, martyr and molest. Forgive me, Cupid, I confess I faill, To crave the thing that may me not availl; ?it, to the end I may my grief digest, Anis burne hir breist, that first begouth my baill, That sho may sey vhat sicknes me possest. XXVI. THE SECREIT PRAIS OF LOVE. As evirie object to the outuard ee, Dissaivis the sight, and semis as it is sene, Quhen not bot shap and cullour ?it we se, For no thing els is subject to the ene; As stains and trees appeiring gray and grene, Quhais quantities vpon the sight depends; Bot qualities the cunning [sense transcends.] Euen sa, vha sayis they sie me as I am— I mene—a man, suppose they sie me move, Of ignorance they do tham selfis condam. By syllogisme, this properly I prove: Quha sees, by look, my loyaltie in love— Quhat hurt in hairt, vhat hope or hap I haiv? Quhilk ressone movis the senses to consaiv. Imaginatione is the outuard ee, To spy the richt anatomie of mynd; Quhilk, by some secreit sympathie, may see The force of love vhilk can not be defynd. Quharthrou the hairt, according to his kynd, Compassionat, as it appeiris plane, Participats of plesur or of pane. Of hevins or earth, some simlitude or shape, By cunning craftismen, to the ees appeir; Bot vho is he can counterfutt the ape, Or paint a passion palpable, I speir, Quhilk enters by the organ of the eir, And bot vhen it is pithilie exprest? And ?it I grant the gritest pairt is gest. Suppose the heuins be huge for to behold, Contening all within thair compas wyde, The starris be tyme, thoght tedious, may be told; Becaus within a certan bounds they byd: The carde the earth from waters may devyde: Bot vho is he can limit love, I wene, Quhom nather carde nor compas can contene? Quhat force is this, subdeuing all and sum? Quhat force is this that maks the tygris tame? Quhat force is this that na man can ouircum? Quhat force is this, that rightlie nane can name? Quhat force is this, that careis sik a fame? A vehemency that words can not reveill, Quhilk I conclude to suffer and conceill. XXVII. [THE POETS LEGACIE.] Ressave this harte, vhois constancie wes sik, Quhill it wes quick, I wot ?e never kneu A harte more treu within a stomok stik, Till tym the prik of jelousie it sleu; Lyk as my heu, by deidly signis, furthsheu, Suppose that feu persavd my secreit smart. Lo, heir the hairt that ?e ?our self ouirthreu: Fairweill! adeu! sen death mon vs depart. Bot, lo! hou first my legacy I leiv: To God I give my spirit in heuin so hie; My poesie I leave my prince to preiv; No richt can reiv him of my rhetorie: My bains to be bot bureit vhair I die; I leiv to thee the hairt wes nevir fals, About thy hals to hing, vhare thou may sie: Let thyn to me, then, be so constant als. Remember vhair I said, once eftirnone, Or March wer done, that thou thy cheeks suld weet, And for me greet, or endit war that mone: I sie, ouer soon, my prophesie compleit. O Lady sueet, I feir we neuer meet; I feill my spreet is summond from above For to remove: nou welcome windin sheet! Death givis decreet that thou must lose thy love. This sentence som thing I persaiv too sair, To meit na mair with thee, my love, alace! God give the grace, that na vnkyndlie cair Do the dispair, nor thy gude fame deface! Give patience place—considder weill the cace; This is the race that euery man must rin, Thoght I begin, vha had no langer space.— Thee to imbrace once, God! if I micht win! Sen for thy saik, Death with his darte me shot, That I am bot a carioun of clay, Quha quhylome lay about thy snauie throt,— Nou I must rot, vha some tym stoud so stay. Quhat sall I say? This warld will auay. Anis on a day, I seimd a semely sight. Thou wants the wight that neuer said the nay: Adeu for ay! This is a lang guid nicht! XXVIII. [MELANCIIOLIE, GRIT DEPUT OF DISPAIR.] Melancholie, grit deput of Dispair, With painfull pansing comis apace, Acompanyde with Cair, Quhais artal?ie is Angvish shooting sair, Of purpose to perseu the place Vhair Plesvr maid repair. Presuming to prevaill, A muster grit they mak. Amids thair battell, bitter Bail Displayis his baner blak, Quhais colours do declair To signifie bot smart; Quharin is painted cold Dispair, Quha wrings a hop[les harte;] Quhilk armes on far so vglie ar, And ay convoyd with Dolovr and with Dvil, That Hope micht skar, if they come nar, And fray ane hairt perhaps out of his huill. For sighis and sobbis of shooting hes not ceist, Quhill they haif brasht the buluark of my bre[ist], And cryis, “Go to, the hous is win. Melancholie! cum in.” Thoght Rigovr then be rekles rash, ?it Curage bydis the brash; And then the hairt vhilk never ?eild, Of Constancie hes maid his sheild, Quharon thair shaftis and sharpest shottis, Lyk hailstanes aff ane studie stottis. ?it pairties proudlie baith pretend The victorie in end; And so the tyme, but treuis, they spe[nd,] To assaill and to defend. The rendring reid, vhilk bouis with euerie blas[t,] In stormis bot stoupis, vhen strongest treis [Ar to the ground down-cast;] Bot ?it the rok, vhilk firmer is and fast Amidst the rage of roring seas, He nevir grouis agast: The busteous blast he byds, With watring wauis and huge, Quhilk ramping ouer his rigging ryds, Bot can not caus him budge. Quhat reks then of the reid? Or of the trees vhat reks? The rok remanes a rok indeid, Quhilk nather bouis nor breks; So sall my harte, with patient parte, Remane a rok all rigour to resist, And sall not start to suffer smart For ane, quhom to obey, I count me blist. ?ea, thoght I had a hundreth thousand hairts, And euiry hairt peirc't with als mony dairts, And euirie dairt thairof also Als mony shafts and mo, And eviry shaft thairof must needs To haif als mony heeds, And euirie head als mony huikis, And evirie huik als mony fluiks, And evirie fluik in me war fast, So long as breath of lyf micht last, I suld not seme for shame to shrink, For hir, of death to drink; Quhais angels ees micht ay, I think, Revive me with a wink. XXIX. [THAT HIS HAIRT IS WOUNDIT.] The cruell pane and grevous smart, That I endure, baith day and nicht, Hes so bereft my woundit hairt, That I am lyk nane other wight. With pansing sair I am opprest, In absence of hir I love best. Sometym I buir ane hert wes frie, Quhilk nevir will be so agane; Thoght Cupid markit oft at me, He wastit monie a shot in vane: ?it Fortun broght me in that place, Quhare I might sie hir plesand face. A burning darte of hot desyre, That bearne buir aluayis at his belt, Quhairwith he set my breist on fyre, And maid my woundit hairt to melt. Fra I the force thairof did feild, I wes constraned for to ?eeld To hir, the lustiest on lyve That euer was, or euer will be; Quhais beutie does with Venus stryve, And, in the end, gettis victorie. Hir colour does exceid, als far As Phœbus does the morning star. Hir hair above hir forheid grouis, By Natur curling bright and shene; Hir brouis they are lyk bendit bouis, Hir ees lyk pearcing arroues kene; Quharuith sho hes me woundit so, I want a harte—and she hes tuo. It is a thing most evident, Quhilk Natur dois to all men give; It folouis also, consequent, No man without a harte can live. Sen ?e posses my hairt all hours, ?e bruik it weill, an len me ?ours. Then freshest Phœnix, freind and fo, Both fremmd and freindly, nou fair weill. Quhen I sall be full far the fro, My verse before thy feet sall kneill, To caus thee tak this hairt to thee, Quhilk wald no more remane with me. XXX. [THE POET COMPLENES ON LOVE AND FORTUN.] On Love and Fortun I complene, On ?ou, and on my hairt also; Bot, most of all, on my tuo ene, The gritest workers of my wo: All vhilks hes causit so my smart, That I must live without a hairt. First, to the eyis committit war, The keepers of the hairt to be, To spy and to persaiv on far The coming of the enemie: Bot they that had this watch to keep, In Beuties bosum fell on sleep. Then, fra the pairty adversar Persavit the fortres but defence, They clam the buluark, soft and fair, Quharas the hart maid residence. Bot ?it I wyt the harte be sake It ?eildt to Love without a strake. The blindit Archer als I blame, Beginner of my grevous grains; Quhilk shameles shooter thoght no shame To smyll, and shute me, baith at ains. Bot, sen he took me vnder trest, He band me bundman to the best, To wit, vnto ?our womanheid; Quhilk worst I wyt of all my woes: Quhais beutie, be it homicide, I feir it most of all my foes; Quhilk Natur set so far above The rest, vhill that it vanquisht Love. I wyt Dame Fortun, not that sho Hes set ?ou highest in degrie, Bot rather, that sho wald not do The lyk, in all respects, to me. Had our estates bene weill compaird, I had no vterlie dispaird. XXXI. [THE PERVERSITIE OF HIS INCLINATIONES THROU LOVE.] My fansie feeds vpon the sugred gall; Against my will, my weill does work my wo; My cairfull chose does chuse to keep me thrall; My frantik folie fannis vpon my fo: My lust alluirs my licorous lippis to taist The bait vharin the suttle hook is plaic't. My hungry hope doth heap my hevy hap; My syndrie sutes procuris the mair disdane; My stedfast steppis ?it slydis into the trap; My tryed treuth intanglis me in trane: I spy the snair, and will not bakuards go; My resone ?eelds, and ?it sayis na thairto. In plesand path I tred vpon the snaik; My flamming thrist I quench with venemous wyne; In daintie dish I do the poyson tak; My langour bids me rather eit nor pyne: I sau, I sett—no flour nor fruit I find; I prik my hand, ?it leavis the rose behind. XXXII. [THE POET REASONS WITH HIS MAISTRES.] ?ong tender plante! in spring tym of ?our ?eirs, Quhais fame mot floorish fresh and never faid, Clene polisht pearle! vnspottit as appeirs, On vhom my Love is, if ?e lyk it, laid; Not that I grene ?our honour to degraid, Bot rather wald ?our weilfair ay advance; ?it I must say, as sooth men oft hes said: Love maks the choyce, bot Fortun maks the cha[nce.] Quhare Weirds will work, vha may withstand thair [will?] Nane dou reduce the Destinies decreit; Bot vhat they ordane, ather gude or ill, Force is to suffer, ather sour or sueit. Quhat they determe, no sentence can retreit; Not as men wald, bot as they will, they vote. Thoght some hold fortun for a fekles freit, Luk as it lyks, I look bot for my lote. Quhair I haif chosen I culd be content, If that my luk war vhair I love to light. If I come speid, I think my tyme weill spent; And if I mis to mend it as I micht, I can reteir vhan resone thinks it richt. Thair is no match bot vhair tuo mutuall [meits;] Men mettall tryis by sey, and not by slight; For ?e mon grant, all is not gold that gleits. Some flours may shoot, suppose they haif no seed, Als trees may floorish, and bring furth feu fruit. Not that in ?ou sik doublenes I dreid, Suppose ?e seme to shift me vhen I suit. I can forbeir, if once I get rebuit; I will not bind, bot vhair I bound to byde. At syndrie marks, if that ?e shaip to shoot, ?e may shoot short, or sometym far asyde. Dreigh river marks, with hights and hidden houis, Ar perrillous, and not as they appeir; Beguyling bairnis that shoots with brissall bouis, And dou not drau thair arrouis to thair eir. Short butts ar better, vhair thair bouis may beir. Far foullis hes ay fair fethers, sum will say: Quhen ?e haif lost, it is too lait to leir: A turne in tyme is ay worth other tuay. Tak tym in tyme, vhill tyme is to be tane, Or ?e may wish, and want it vhen ?e wald: ?e get no grippe agane, if it be gane; Then, vhill ?e haif it, best is for to hald. Thoght ?e be ?ong, ?it once ?e may be ald: Tyd will not tarie; speid or it be spent. To prophesie, I dar not be so bald, Bot tyn ?e tyme—perhaps ?e may repent. Houbeit ?our beuty far on breid be blaune, I thank my God I shame not of my shap; If ?e be guid, the better is ?our auin, And he that getis ?ou hes the better hap. I wald not sik men in ?our credit crap, Quha heght ?ou fairer nor I feir ?e find; Thairfor, I wald ?e lookit or ?e lap, And waver not, lyk widdercok in wind. If ?e be constant, I sall neuer change; If ?e be fickle, I am forc't to flitt; If ?e be stedfast, I sall not be strange; If ?e be wylie, I wald leirne a wit. Ay as ?e wse ?ou, I agrie with it. Be doing on, I dout not ?e ar wyse. Baith heft and blead ar in ?our hand, as ?it; Then barlacheis or barlachois advyse. Can ?e not play at “nevie nevie nak”? A pretty play, whilk children often wse, Quhair tentles bairnis may to their tinsall tak The neiv with na thing, and the full refuse. I will not skar ?ou, sen ?e mynd to chuse, Bot put ?our hand by ha?ard in the creill; ?it men hes mater vharvpon to muse, For they must drau ane adder or ane eill. Thoght ?e be, as I mon confes ?ou, fair, I wald not wish that fra ?our friends ?e r[an.] Houbeit ?e think me to ?ou no compair, I haif the moyan, lyk ane other man. I neid not waist it that my elders wan; I hope to help it, if I had my helth. Gar ?e me gang from ?ou, whair I began, If I wald vant, I wot of griter welth. ?it I am not so covetous of kynd, Bot I prefer my plesur in a pairt; Thoght I be laich, I beir a michtie mynd; I count me rich, can I content my hairt. ?it, or I enter in ane other airt, ?our vter ansueir courteously I crave, Quhom ?e will keep, or vhom ?e will decairt: Sa fair ?e weill, vhill I the same resave. XXXIII. [THE POETS DREME.] Quhen folish Phaeton had his course outrun, And plung'd the fyrie Phlægon in the sea, And bright [Diana] had bot neu begun Vpon the grund to cast hir watrie ee; Quhat tyme the bluid vnto the hairt does flie, As sojouris sure thair capitan to keep, At that tyme Morpheus sent to summond me; Quhom I obeyde, and sa I fell asleep. Quhair, in my dreme, I sau anone appeir A naiked boy, vha bure a Turkish bou; He nokt ane arrou longer nor a speir, The heid wes gold, vhilk brint lyk ony lou. His countenance begouth ay for to grou Mair vncouthlyk, vharof I wox afrayde: Quod he, “Defend thee, gallant, if thou dou, For thou sall be no longer vnassayit.” With that he shot and hat me on the breist; The sheirand shaft soon slippit to my hairt; Syne bad me cum to ?ou, and mak requeist Quhair I suld find the salue to heall my smar[t.] Vpon my feet incontinent I start, And stagring stood, astonisht with the straik: Haiv pitie thairfor on my painfull harte, And saif the man that suffers for ?our sa[ik.] My harte wes ay at libertie till nou That I did sie ?our cumly cristall ene, Quhais luifsum looks so peirc't my body th[rou,] That, ay sen syne, ?our bondman I haif be[ne.] I pray thairfor, with sighing from my splen[e,] ?our womanheid for to be treu and k[ynd.] This paper, in my absence, sall obtene To hold me aluay present in ?our mynd. Fra I be gane, I knau thair are aneu Quha wald be glade ?our favour to pro[cure:] Be permanent, houbeit they perseu; Let not sik louns with leasings ?ou allure; Sua our twa loves for evir sall indure, Conjoynd in ane, as fyr is in the flint. Found ay ?our bigging vhair the grund is sur[e;] Sa nather tyme nor travel sall be tint. Tak heid thairto, I hairtlie ?ou exhort, And keep in mynd the counsel I ?ou give; If that perchance some ?onkiers cum athort With facund words, and preissis ?ou to prieve, Luik this my letter; it sall ?ou relieve In absence, alsueil as I war in sight. I will not stand with mo words ?ou to deiv, Bot, for this tyme, I bid ?ou haif “Guid nicht.” XXXIV. [TO HIS MAISTRES.] O cleir, most deir, give eir unto my cry. Sueit thing, bening and ?ing, of ?eiris grene, But sleuth, haiv reuth: my treuth the tym sall try. Remeid with speid, or deid I must sustene; For thoght hes wroght and broght me to dispair; Becaus no signe is shaune That ?e held me ?our aune, That I micht it haif knaune, To comfort me of cair. My hairt inwart does smart within my briest; My mynd most kynd is pynd but recompence Of ?ou, I trou, wha nou regardeth leist My wo, but ho to slo me, but offence, That am ane lam; the same ?e may persaive, For I am innocent And eik obedient. If I be permanent, Some pruif thairof I haif. ?our ee may se, in me is no deceit; ?our eir perqueir may heir my constance als. Espye if I applye ane vther geat, Or oght hes soght quhilk moght be to ?ou fals. Bot ay I stay aluay vpon ?our grace. In esperance I byd, And firmely do confyd That Fortun sall provyd For us baith tym and p[lace,] Secreit to meit, my spreit to recreat, And pleis myn eis, quhilks deis for laik of sight, And kisse with blisse; for this may mitigat My quent torment. Consent, sent it is richt, And do thairto as sho that may alone My persone saiv or spill. To grant me lyf, or kill— All lyes into ?our will, As ?e list to dispone. Restore thairfore to glore precordiall My lif from stryf or knyf of Atropus. With noy destroy my joy terrestriall, To blame ?our name with fame most odious, If ?e sall be to me without respect So strange to let me sterv, Except ?e sie me suerv; Then do as I deserv, Bot causles not correct. For that, ?e wat, may lat a man to love, And hald him cauld vha wald to ?ou obey. Be war ouir far ?e gar me not remove; Bot give me leiv, and greiv me not, I pray: For out of doubt about vs ar aneu Quha deadly hatred haith That we love other baith. God keep vs from thair skaith! Fair weill, my Lady treu. XXXV. [IN PRAIS OF HIS MAISTRES.] Quhy bene ?e, Musis, all so long On sleep this mony a day? Let not ?our harmony and song In silence thus decay. Distill by influence ?our stremis of eloquence, That, throu ?our heuinlie liquor sueit, My pen in rhetoric may fleit, For till expres The comlines Of my Maistres, With joy repleit. To kythe hir cunning, Natur wald Indeu hir with sik grace, My spreit rejosis to behald Her smyling angels face, Lyk Phœbus in the south, To skorne the rest of ?outh. Hir curling loks, lyk golden rings, About hir hevinly haffats hings, Quhilks do decore Hir body more, Quhom I adore Above all things. Hir brouis ar brent: lyk golden threeds Hir siluer shyning brees. The bony blinks my courage feeds Of hir tua christall ees, Tuinkling illuminous, With beamis amourous; Quhairin tua naikit boyis resorts, Quhais countenance good hope reports; For they appeir Vith smyling cheir, As they wald speir At me some sports. Hir comelie cheeks of vive colour, Of rid and vhyt ymixt, Ar lyk the sanguene jonet flour Into the lillie fixt. Hir mouth mellifluous, Hir breathing savorous, Hir rosie lippis most eminent, Hir teeth lyk pearle of orient, Hir halse more vhyt Nor I can wryt; With that perfyt And sapient. Hir vestall breist of ivorie, Quhairon ar fixit fast Tua tuins of clene virginitie, Lyk boullis of alabast. Out throu hir snauie skin, Maist cleirlie kythes within Hir saphir veins, lyk threids of silk, Or violets in vhytest milk. If Natur sheu Hir hevinly heu In vhyt and bleu— It wes that ilk. Hir armes ar long, hir shulders braid, Hir middill gent and small: The mold is lost, vharin wes maid This A per se of all. The gods ar in debait Concerning hir estait; Diana keeps this Margarit, Bot Hymen heghts to match hir meit: Deserve let sie Amount from thrie. Go merie she, That is so sueet. Quhat can both shoot and open loks As can the only kie? Persaiv this pithie paradox, And mark it weill in me. Quhais beutie hes me burt? Quhais beutie healls my hurt? Quhais beutie blythnes me bereivis? Quhais beutie gladnes to me givis? Quhais beutie, lo, Does me vndo? Quhais beutie, to, My spreit revivis? XXXVI. [SEN FORTUN IS MY FO.] O lovesome Lady, lamp of light! Freshest of flouris fair! Thy beutie and thy bemes bright Maks me to sigh full sair. My noy reneueth evirie nicht, And kendlis all my cair; [And so] I sigh suppose I may na mair, Sen Fortun is my fo. Sometyme I had gude confidence That plesur suld succeid, Quhill in the tyme of our absence Good fortun did me leid; But nou I find my esperance Almaist ouercome with dreid: Also I feill the fatal Nymphis threid, Sen Fortun is my fo. Is this ?our lau? ?e gods of love! Or do ?ee so consent, Into ?our counsels from above, All lovers to torment? Better it war for our behove We had not bene acquent, Nor go To love, and na way be content, Sen Fortun is our fo. I put no doubt bot ?e wald do ?our pouer me to saive, Bot tym will not consent thairto, So grit vnhap we haif; ?it be ?e sure, that ?e ar scho Quhome-to my harte I gaive, But mo. Grant me some kyndnes vhen I crave, Thoght Fortun be our fo. Let not my treuth and constancie For euer be for?et, Nor tak no plesur for to sie Me fettrit in ?our net; Bot grant me als grit libertie, As first vhen we tua mett, My jo. I greue, for it I can not gett, Sen Fortun is my fo. Alace! these golden houris ar gone, Quhen nane did vs debar; That nou sik licience haif we none— Skantlie to speik afar: ?it wicked peple will suppone We do the thing we dar, Both tuo. My curage prikis me to ryd nar, Thoght Fortun be my fo. XXXVII. [TO HIS MAISTRES.] O plesand plant, passing in pulchritude! O lillie, lude of all the Muses nyne! I laik ingyne to shau thy celsitude; A tearie fluid does blind thir ees of myne. Thyn eirs inclyne vnto my cairfull cry: Sen nane bot I hes for thy person pyne, Let me not tyn, whom thou intends to try. Tak tym in tym, for tym will not remane, Nor come agane, if that it once be lost. Sen we ar voced, whairfor suld we refrane, To suffer pain for ony bodies bost? My vexit ghost, quhilk rageing love dois roste, Is brint almost, thrugh heit of my desyr; Then quench this fyre, quhilk runneth ay the poste Out throu my cost, consuming bain and lyre. Nou if this heit descend into my levir, A fervent fevir sall soon my harte infect; Thairfor correct this humor nou or nevir, Or we dissevir, suppose we be suspect. Go to—vhat rek? and gar the bealing brek; For, fra it lek, I hald the danger done. Then speid ?ou soon, that we no tym neglect To tak effect in waning of the mone. XXXVIII. [HE REJOISES, AS DID FORMERLY THE GREEKS.] Before the Greeks durst enterpryse In armes to Troy toun to go, They set a Counsell sage and wyse, Apollos ansueir for to kno Hou they suld speid, and haif succes In that so grit a busines. Then did they send the wysest Grekis To Delphos, vhare Apollo stode; Quha, with the teiris vpon thair cheeks, And with the fyrie flammis of wod, And all such rites as wes the guyse, They made that grit god sacrifyce. Quhen they had endit thair requests, And solemnely thair service done, And drunke the vyne, and kild the beists, Apollo made them ansueir soon Hou Troy and Trojans haiv they suld, To vse them hailly as they wold. Quhilk ansueir maid thame not so glad, That thus the victors they suld be, As evin the ansuer that I had Did gritly joy and comfort me, Quhen, lo! thus spak Apollo myne: All that thou seeks, it sall be thyne. XXXIX. [HE BIDS ADEU TO HIS MAISTRES.] Adeu, O desie of delyt; Adeu, most plesand and perfyt; Adeu, and haif gude nicht: Adeu, thou lustiest on lyve; Adeu, suete thing superlatyve; Adeu, my lamp of licht! Lyk as the lyssard does indeid Leiv by the manis face, Thy beutie lykuyse suld me feid, If we had tyme and space. Adeu nou; be treu nou, Sen that we must depairt. For?et not, and set not At licht my constant hairt. Albeit my body be absent, My faithfull hairt is vigilent To do ?ou service true; Bot, vhen I hant into the place Quhair I wes wont to sie that face, My dolour does reneu. Then all my plesur is bot pane, My cairis they do incres; Vntill I sie your face agane, I live in hevynes. Sair weeping, but sleeping, The nichts I ouerdryve; Quhylis murning, vhylis turning, With thoghtis pensityve. Somtym Good Hope did me comfort, Saying, the tym suld be bot short Of absence to endure. Then Curage quickins so my spreit, Quhen I think on my lady sueet, I hald my service sure. I can not plaint of my estait, I thank the gods above; For I am first in hir consait, Quhom both I serve and love. Hir freindis ay weindis To caus hir to revok; Sho bydis, and slydis No more then does a rok. O lady, for thy constancie, A faithfull servand sall I be, Thyn honour to defend; And I sall surelie, for thy saik, As doth the turtle for her maik, Love to my lyfis end. No pene nor travell, feir nor dreid, Sall caus me to desist. Then, ay vhen ?e this letter reid, Remember hou we kist; Embracing, with lacing, With others teiris sueet. Sik blissing in kissing I quyt till we tua meit. XL. [HE BEWAILES HIS WOFULL ESTAIT.] Quha wareis all the wicked weirds, bot I? Or vha, bot I, suld curse the thrauard faits? To vhom, bot me, does destinies deny Some kynd of comfort to thair auin estaits? For vhom, bot me, doth Love in ambush ly, With hidden huiks in his beguyling baits Of sugred sueet dissaitis? Weill ward thou weep, O ouer audacious ee! Sen with a sight thou wes so soon ouersyld. I sent the forth as centinall to see; Bot with a blink dame Beutie thee begyld: Fra thou wes fast, and had no force to flie, My wofull hairt auay with thee thou wyld, Fra me to be exyld. To follou thee, Affectioun tuk the feeld; Fair-heghting Hope wes laith to byd behind: Then Curage, with a stomok stoutly steeld, Bad Will ga wave his baner with the wind. Last, Reson rais, ay shotfrie vnder sheeld; Bot Fantasie fast folloud him behind, And bleu him bravelie blind. Then lyk a neu maid mariner, in mist Quha saillis the sea but compasse, lead or carte, By change of wind wes wrong befor he wist, As prentise proud, mair peirter nor expert; Evin so did I, als ignorant, insist, As novice neu vnvsit in that art, Till I had hurt my harte. Or I wes war, I had resauit the wound, So dangerous, so deidly, and so deip, The strenth vharof gart all my stomok stou[nd]. From vein to vein I felt the canker creep, The poysound poynt had peirc't me so profou[nd,] That, welauay! I culd bot waill and weip And sigh, vhen I sould sleep. Love maid my chose, bot Fortun maid my ch[ance.] Love folloud fast, bot fen?eid Fortun fled. Love perseveird, in hope of recompance; Bot Fortun fals ay shorde that we suld shed. Love willing wes my labour to advance, Bot Fortun ay my brydall bakuard led; Quhilk all my bail hes bred. ?it not a vheet my thraldome I forthink: War I to chuse I wald not change my ch[ose.] I shaip not, for no suddan shours, to shrink, Sen peircing pyks ar kyndlie with the rose. Houbeit mishap be in my harte a hink, ?it I will on hir permanence repose, In spyte of Fortuns nose. The highest hillis mair thretnit ar with thunder; And tallest trees with tempest ofter tryde Nor hillocks small, or bramble bushis vnder: Vnworthie things ar aluay leist invyde. Quhat Natur works, we may not think it wonder; Love longer lastis the derer that we by it: This dou not be denyit. Let Weirds rin wod; let furious Faits be fearce; Let absence vrne; let Cupids arrou peirce; Let Fortun froun; let Destinies despyte; Let tratling tongues, let bablers ay bakbyte; Let enemies my haples hap reheirce— I cair not by thair malice all a myte: In Love is my delyte. XLI. [THE NIGHT IS NEIR GONE.] Hay! nou the day dauis; The jolie Cok crauis; Nou shroudis the shauis, Throu Natur anone. The thissell-cok cryis On louers vha lyis. Nou skaillis the skyis: The nicht is neir gone. The feildis ouerflouis With gouans that grouis, Quhair lilies lyk lou is, Als rid as the rone. The turtill that treu is, With nots that reneuis, Hir pairtie perseuis: The night is neir gone. Nou Hairtis with Hyndis, Conforme to thair kyndis, Hie tursis thair tyndis, On grund vhair they grone. Nou Hurchonis, with Hairis, Ay passis in pairis; Quhilk deuly declaris The night is neir gone. The sesone excellis Thrugh sueetnes that smellis; Nou Cupid compellis Our hairtis echone On Venus vha valkis, To muse on our maikis, Syn sing, for thair saikis:— The night is neir gone. All curageous knichtis Agains the day dichtis The breist plate that bright is, To feght with thair fone. The stoned steed stampis Throu curage and crampis, Syn on the land lampis: The night is neir gone. The freikis on feildis That wight wapins weildis With shyning bright shieldis [As] Titan in trone: Stiff speiris in reistis, Ouer cursoris cristis, Ar brok on thair breistis: The night is neir gone. So hard ar thair hittis, Some sueyis, some sittis, And some perforce flittis On grund vhill they grone. Syn groomis that gay is, On blonkis that brayis, With suordis assayis: The night is neir gone. XLII. [AN ADMONITIOUN TO ?OUNG LASSIS.] A bony “No,” with smyling looks agane, I wald ?e leirnd, sen they so comely ar. As touching “?es,” if ?e suld speik so plane, I might reprove ?ou to haif said so far. Noght that ?our grant, in ony wayis, micht gar Me loth the fruit that curage ocht to chuse; Bot I wald only haif ?ou seme to skar, And let me tak it, fen?eing to refuse; And warsill, as it war against ?our will, Appeiring angrie, thoght ?e haif no yre: For haif, ?e heir, is haldin half a fill. I speik not this, as trouing for to tyre: Bot, as the forger, vhen he feeds his fyre, With sparks of water maks it burne more bald; So, sueet denyall doubillis bot desyr, And quickins curage fra becomming cald. Wald ?e be made of, ?e man mak it nyce; For dainties heir ar delicat and deir, Bot plentie things ar prysde to lytill pryce; Then thought ?e hearken, let no wit ?e heir, Bot look auay, and len thame ay ?our eir: For, folou love, they say, and it will flie. Wald ?e be lovd, this lessone mon ?e leir; Flie vhylome love, and it will folou thee. XLIII. [MONTGOMERIES WELCOME TO LORD SEMPLE, ON HIS RETURNE FROM FRANCE.] Aualk, Montgomeries Muse, And sey vhat thou can say: Thy long and just excuse Maecenas taks auay; Quhais high heroique actis His name immortall maks. Then welcome hame, my lord; Suete Semple, welcome hame; Quhais vertues wan the word That formest flies with Fame; Quha-of all cuntreyis crakis, And [the immortall maks.] Thou wan the flour in France, With eviry kynd of armes, As dager, suord, and lance, In pastyme and alarmes. Thy leiving no man laks, Bot the immortall maks. Thy body, mynd, and spreit, Disposd, resolvd, and quik; Thy hairt, thy hands, thy feit, Magnanime, strong, and sik As curage all contracts: Quhilk the immortall maks. Thy meeknes into moues, And aufulnes in yre, From sik a fontan floues As springs for till aspyre. Sik frute thy travell taks, And the immortal maks. Thy cuntrie, king, and kin, Thy qualities decoird. All pairts vhair thou wes in, Thinks long for thee, my lord: So wyd thy word does waxe, That the immortall maks. Sen poets maist profound Thy praysis do proclame, My trompet, to, sall sound The famphar of thy fame, Quod he vhom siknes wraks, And the immortall maks. Then happy travell tane, Sen thou hes boght the best; Thoght pairt of gold be gane, Thy honour is increst. Men weill imployes thair paks, That thame immortall maks. XLIV. [HE PRAYIS TO HIS MAISTRES FOR PITIE.] Remember rightly, vhen ?e reid, The woe and dreid, but hope to speid, I drie into dispair. My hairt within my breist does bleid Vnto the deid, vithout remeid; I'm hurt, I wot not vhair. Alace! vhat is the caus, think I, But grace that I in langour ly? The more I drink, more I desyr: As I aspyre, the fervent fyre My cairfull corps consume. Me to torment, no tym ?e tyre, Baith bane and [lyre,] throu Cupids yre, To dead, but ony dome. I burne, I frei?e in yce also; I turne, for freindship, to my fo. In prison sen ?e hald my hairt, Releiv my smart; drau out this darte Furth of my bailfull breist. Haif pitie on my painfull parte. As by the carte men knoues the arte, Both south, north, west, and eist, ?e may persave my wounds ar grene, I say, and look bot to my ene, Quhais longsum looks my lyf beuryis. Wo to the spyis first did suppryis My hairt within ?our hald! Quhilk fast into ?our fetters lyis, In dout vhat wyse that feirfull syse Pronunce thair sentence wald. I quake for feir—my puncis lope— I shake betuixt dispair and hope. To crueltie if ?e consent, I am content, as patient, ?our plesur to fulfill; Or, pleis ?our pitie to prevent My grit torment, or I be shent, Chuse ?ou to spair or kill. I stand of death no vhitt affrayde: Command, and ?e sall be obeyde. XLV. [HE CALLIS ON DEATH TO RELIEVE HIM.] The wofull working of my woundit hairt, Quhilk danger hes neir drivin in dispair, Is sorer to sustene then is the darte Of Death, vhilk suld dissolve my cruell cair. Thrugh fortun frail; vhais vnfelicitie Hes wroght in me sik caus of sighing sair, That death suld be no lothsum thing to me. Come, gentill Death, and that with suddentie, And mak dispatch of this puir hairt of myne. Thy sterving straik with force thou let out flie, And light on me, to end my peirles pyne. Sen sho vhom I do serve will not inclyne, Nor grant me grace, my pains for to deploir, Bot will, for want of pitie sie me tyne, Come, gentle Death, and let me die thairfor. Alace! that euer sik perfyte beutie As is in ?ou, my lovesome Lady deir, Suld haif bene plac't thair, vhair as Pietie Might not most frelie in hir place appeir! Alace! that Danger, with hir deidly cheir, Such lordship had [vhair we maist treuly love!] Alace! that ever a ?oldin prisoneir Suld feill the peirles painis that I nou prove! Alace! suld I for hairtie love be hated? Or suld I find, for friendly favour, fead? Alace! suld my treu service thus be quated With hir that is the chose of womanheid? Alace! suld sho that suld, of right, remeid The deidly dolour daylie I sustene, Be merciles!—Then wish I to be deid, And so be quyt of all my cairis clene. XLVI. [DISPLEASUR, WITH HIS DEADLY DAIRT.] Displesur, with his deadly dairt So horriblie hes hurt my hairt, With sik ane heid That no remeid, Save only deid, Can cure my smart. The poysond poynt me priks, Quhilk in my stomok stiks Profound; Quhais venom rains Thrugh al my vains: No salue can mak me sound. I count not of my lyf a cute. My hairt hes biddin sik rebute, That it wald evin, God knauis in hevin, Wish to be revin [Out by the rute.] It is so crost with cair, That it may nevir mair Revive. Cum thairfor, Death, And cut my breath: I list not longer live. The Destinies my lyf despytis, And bitter baill my bouells bytis; These thrauard Thrie— Curst mot they be To martyr me!— Laughis and delyts; For they haif wroght my weird Vnhappiest on eird, And ay Continues still To work my ill, With all mishief they may. Hes hevins—hes erth—hes God—hes air, Determinat that I dispair? Hes all in ane My contrare tane? For me allane, They ar too sair. Sen thair is no remorce, My patience perforce Hes bene. Of ills, I wse The leist to chuse: I may not mend bot mene. Might my misluk look for relief, Or ?it doght I digest my grief, Then wer I wyse, It to disguyse; Bot lo, vhair lyis My maist mischief! I smore if I conceill, I wrak if I reveill, My hurt. Judge, ?e vha heirs, Quhat burthene beiris My stomok, stuft with sturt. For, from Carybdis vhill I flie, I slyde in Sylla, ?e may sie; I saill, it semes, Tuixt tua extremis, That danger demes My ship sall die. Nou, Sone, since I must smart, Thou of my age that art The staffe,— Evin Mvrray myne, Len me a lyne, To end my epitaph. XLVII. THE ELEGIE. Now, since the day of our depairt appeirs, Guid resone wald my hand to ?ou suld wr[yt] That vhilk I can not weill expres but teirs; Videlicet:—“Adeu! my Lady vhyt.” Adeu, my love, my lyking, and delyt, Till I returne; for vhilk I think so lang, That absence els does all my bouells byt: Sik gredie grippis I feell befor I gang. Resave, vhill than, a harte lyk for to mang, Quhilk freats and fryis in furious flammis of fy[re;] Keep it in gage, bot let it haif no wrang Of sik as may perhaps his place desyre. This is the summe of that vhilk I requyre: If it hes ocht offendit, let it smart; If it be true, then let it haif the hyre. Oh! wold to God ?e might behold this harte! Quharin a thousand things ?e suld advert: Thair suld ?e sie the wound vhilk ?e it g[ave;] Thair suld ?e sie the goldin deadly darte; Thair suld ?e sie, hou ?e bereft it haiv; Thair suld ?e sie ?our image by the laiv; Thair suld ?e sie ?our hevinly angels face; Thair suld ?e soon my permanence persaiv; Thair suld ?e sie ?our name haif only p[lace;] Thair suld ?e sie my languishing, alace! For our depairt: bot since ?e knou my painis, I hope, if ?e considder weill the case, And spyis the teirs vhilks ouer my visage rains, If in ?our breist sik sympathie remanis, Then sall ?e suffer som thing for my saik. Quhair constant love is aluay, it constranis, In weill or wo, coequall pairt to take; Lyk as my members all begins to quake, That of ?our duill the half I do indure, Quhilk I suppone ?e for my absence mak. Then haif no dout that ony creature Can dispossesse ?ou of my hairt, be sure, Nor ?it remove from ?ou my constant mynd. Since I am ?ours, quhom love culd not allure, Sen I wes borne, till nou that I enclynd To ?ou allone, for whom my hairt is pynd. Of lovis fyr, before, I nevir kneu, Nor ?it acquent with Cupid in this kynd; Bot look! hou soon gude fortun to me sheu ?our sueet behaviour and ?our hevinly heu, As A per se, that evir Natur wroght, Then vncouth cairs in me began aneu, Both in my spreit and in my trublit thoght: My libertie vhilk I in bondage broght, Sa that my frank and frie desyre, or than, Ane hunder places for my plesur soght, And ay sall do, whill I am leving man. Sall ?e then, efter our depairt, for?et That vhilk is ?ours, and change on na wyse can? Hou soon myn ee no sight of ?ours culd get, It weeping said:—“O deidly corps, defet! Quhair bene these lamps of light, these crista[ll ees,] Quhilks maid ws ay so mirrie vhen we mett?” Quod I agane, with sighing voce:—“Thou sees, Thoght thou for dolour vnder shadou dees. Be not abaisd, suppose thou haif no sight. Thy sun is hid, and keeps no more degre[es;] Bot, for thy sake, goes to at none, for night: That is to say—that hevinly visage bright, Quharon thou wont thy fantasie to feid, Is far fra the; vhair throu thou laikis th[y sight.”] So, lustie Lady, well of womanheid! Myne ee and I but comfort ar indeed, And do bewaill thy wofull absence ay. Regrating ?ou, my woundit hairt does bleed; And than I think, vhen I am far auay, Leist that, mein tym, blind Love suld thus a[ssay] All meins he micht, by craft or ?it ingyne, To open vp his blindit ees, that they Might clerelie see these gratious ees of thyn; And so, beholding sik a sight divyn, His mynd, to love the, shortly suld be movd; And caus me, at ane instant, for to tyne The thing quhilk I sa lang and leall haiff lovd. Be ?e not constant, vhen ?e sall be provd, Love sall ouercome ?our honest ansueirs all; That ?e sall think, to ?eild, it ?ou behovd: Love is so slie; vhais fairdit language sall Peirce and get entrie throu a stony wall. I wish ?ou, thairfor, with him to be war: His mouth is hony, bot his hairt is gall. On kitlest huiks the sliest baits they ar. If he the heght, or slielie drau the nar, Thou ansueir him:—“Go, Love, reteir the hence; For I love one vho hes my hairt so far, He merits not to tyne him, but offence.” XLVIII. THE NAVIGATIOVN. Haill! bravest burgeoun brekking to the rose, The deu of grace thy leivis mot vnclose; The stalk of treuth mot grant the nurishing; The air of faith support thy florishing; Thy noble counsell, lyk trees about thy grace, Mot plantit be, ilk ane into his place; Quhais ruiting sure and toppis reaching he Mot brek the storme, befor it come to the. They of thy bluid mot grou about thy bordour, To hold thy hedge into ane perfyt ordour, As fragrant flouris of ane helthsome smell, All venemous beistis from the to expell. The preachers treu mot ay thy gardners b[e] To clense thy root from weeds of heresie. Thy gardene wall mak the Neu Testament; So sall thou grou without impediment; All lands about sall feir thy Excellence, And come fra far to do thee reverence: As I myself and all the rest ?e se From Turkie, Egypt, and from Arabie. As for my self, I am ane German borne, Quha ay this fasion, vhilk ?e se, hes worne; Quhilk lenth of tym culd nevir caus me change, Thoght I haiv bene in mony cuntrey strange; Thrugh all Europe, Afrik, and Asia, And throu the neu fund out America. All thair conditiouns I do vnderstand, Baith of the peple, and also of the land; Quhais trim attyre wer tedious to tell: Something ?our grace sall shortly sie ?our sell: In contrair clething, ?our Excellence sall ke[n] The Turk, the More, and the Egyptien. Nou sall I shau vnto ?our Majestie Hou they and I fell first in company. Constantinopil, sometym of Christendome, Pertening to ane Empreour of Rome, Quho, as we reid, wes callit Constantyn: Eftir his name he callit the citie syn, Becaus he lovit it best of tounis all. Euen thair he sat into his tribunall, As in the Metropolitan of Grece; Quhilk his successours bruikit lang in peace, Till tym that they, throu thair iniquitie, Were givin ouer vnto the enemie, As for ane prey, al hail to be devoird. Thair ?ong men slayn, thair virgins war deflorde; Thair tender babis, ?it on the nurish knee, Tane by the feet and cast into the see. Let vther lands a mirrour of this mak, And, by thair nichtbours, example let thame tak. I will not judge vhairfor that God so did, Becaus his secreits ar to all men hid: Bot weill I wot the Lord did so permit; For vhy? the Turk does bruik this citie ?it, And much of Grece he hes into his hands. Bot for to tell ?ou hou the citie stands Hard by the syde of the auld Pontus sea, Fornent it lyis the land of Natalie. Quha in these pairtis pleisis for to hant, The Turkis pasport neids not for to want; Sa I myself, as ane among the laiv, Requyrit ane, vhilk he me glaidly gaiv, That I micht come and sie this noble toun, Quharof befor I hard so grit renoun. Quhilk vhen I come, my fortun wes to be Ludgit perchance with this same companie; Soupit togither; in ane chalmer lay, Crackand ouer heid, whill it wes neir hand [day.] I speird at thame vhair that they last com[e fra,] And eftirward, vhair they myndit to ga. “We duell,” say they, “vnder the star Antart[ic:] Nou wald we sie the Vrses and Pole Arti[c.] We shaip to saill neir the Septentrion, Touards the North, and helthsome regione Nou callit Scotland, as we haif hard repor[t] Of wandring fame, vhilk fleeth ay athort. Quhair presently beginneth for to ring So sapient a ?ing and godly King, A Salomon for richt and judgiment: In eviry langage he is eloquent. All lands about do beir of him record, He is the chosen vessell of the Lord. To sie this King nou glaidly wald we go; And, if ?e pleis to tak ane pairt also, ?e ar bothe welcome, and richt necessar, Vnto his Grace our comming to declair; Far ?e haif travellit throu mony lands, And eviry language also vnderstands.”— “Content,” quod I; and so we wer agreit: Fraughtit our ship, and syne our anker weyde. Phœbus nou rysing, with his laughing grace Smylit on Neptuns still and calmit face. Vp uent our saillis, tauntit to the huins; The trumpets soundit tuentie mirrie tuins. Vp went our boyis to the toppis abone, And ouer the bordour shook our topsaill soon. Some went before for to shaik out the blind. Wp went our bonnets; our missens vp behind. Some, to the gueit fattis for to bedeu the saills, Bothe foir and eft, our taikle drauis and haillis. Our bottismen our geir perfytlie neits. Fair wes the wind, and roum betuene tua sheits. Maisters and pilots, cunning in that arte, Went to the compas for to prik the carte, For to persaiv the dangers vhair they lay: We passingers went to the chesse to play; For in that airt we nothing vnderstude, Thairfor we did thame nather ill nor good. Our ship wes clene and saillit very fast. Of Hellespont or we the straits had past, We struik at Cestus, and at Abydon; Quhair passing ships are rypit, euery one, To sie if they haif goods that ar forbiddin; So from thair presence ?e may haif no thing hiddin; For these tua Castells ar the only kees Of all Turkie, and do divyde the sees— Pontus Euxinus from the Mediterran. On Asia syd, appeiris ?it most plane The walis of the old and famous Troy, Quhilks long ago the Greekis did destroy. The poets wryts that in that place also Leander died, suimming to Hero. Sik Pleonasmus figurs I refuse: I shape a shorter syncopa till vse. And, to my purpose quicklie for to cum, We entred nixt in Mediterraneum. Vnto the Rhods we saild the redy way; Quhilk wes shortsyne of Christendome, they say. To Creta nixt our course directit we, Quhair that they mak this noble Malmesie. Betuixt the Malt and Cicill lay our rout. The wind come skant: we docht not double [out.] Fra that we sau thair micht no better be, We plungit vp the coast of Calabrie. Our Maister soon his lyttil vhissell cheir[d;] His mariners incontinent compeird; And eviry man did by his taikling stand, To haill and drau, as he gaiv them command. “To saill vp Sigeum, mates, we ar assuir[d;] Thairfor tak on ?our babert luif abuird. Out with ?our boulings. The wind is south south west. Wp with ?our sheats, and haill them to the bes[t.] Come no lauer, bot luif a lytill we; For ?on is Sicill with his headis thrie; Quhais shape, ?e sie, is lyk to Cerberus; And, for to deall with, no les dangerous. ?on is Mount Ætna whair the fyre comis out; ?on is Charybdis that vhirlis ay about; And ?on is Sylla, on the other shore, Resisting Neptun, making him to rore. Steir studdie, mate, fra ?e ?our self hes sene thame: Thair is bot dead, or we mon throu betuene thame.” Fra that we come this gredy gulph within, We micht not heir ane other for the din. On baburd syde, the vhirling of the sand; On steirbuird syd, the roks lay off the land. Betuixt the tua we tuik sik taill?eweis, At hank and buick we skippit syndrie seis. As ane is done, another neu begins. Quhill we war past our hair stude widdershins. God saifd our ship, and ruled our noble ruther, And helpt vs throu, as he hes mony vther. Fra we wer past, I wot if we were fane. We will not grene to gang that gait agane. We entrit next in the Tyrrhenum sea, And sailit to tua ylis in Italie— Sardinia, not far from Corsica. We wat ane anchor evin betuixt they tua. We weyde fra thyn, and peyde our anchor custum, And entrit nixt into the sea Liguscum, By Minork and Majork, in the Mediterran; And so alongis all the coast of Spane. Gebraltars straits, at length, syn passit we, And entred in the wyd and ocean sea; Quhais moving maks, as writis Plutarc[hus,] Into the mone ane face appeir to vs. I will not dippe into Astronomie, For feir I fall, in cace I clim so hie: It is the arte that I did nevir leirne. Belyve we left all Aragon asterne. Be we had saillit four and tuentie hours, The lift begouth for to ouercast with shours. The cludis blak ouerquhelmit all the skyis. Neptunus ryders begouth also to ryis; The bouand dolphin, tumbland lik a vhele: Quharby our maister vnderstude right wei[ll] That Eolus wes kindling vp in yre. The heuins all vox rid as ony fyre. The cludis rave in shours of grit hailstanis. Doun, with a clappe, come all our saillis at an[is.] From the northeist thair come an vgly blas[t.] Maid vp our takill, and ouer buird went our [mast.] The storme increst, four dayis, mair and ma[ir;] Our maister also begouth for to dispair; Quhill the fifth day, that it began to cleir: Then, as we micht, we mendit vp our ge[ir;] Quharof the leist pairt wes remanit haill; ?it at the last we come to Portingaill. Glaid wes our fellouis, fra that they sau the sho[re,] And bettir hairted nor they wer before. They tuik some curage, and begouth to crak. First, the Egyptian, he began and spak: “Wes it not heir vhair Pharaos dochter landit, First of the Scots, as we do vnderstand it?” The Turk alledgit Gathelus wes a Greke. So everie man did his opinione speke. ?it baith thair menings wes, I vnderstude, ?our grace wes cumming of thair ancient blude: Quhilk wes the caus that they so willinglie Had cum so far, to se ?our Majestie. Thus cracking on, we did the way ouerdryve, Quhill we, at lenth, in Ireland did aryve; Quhilk wes begun, they said, be thair forbears. Some held thame treu, and others held them lears; Some wald say ?ea, and others some said nay. With Pro and Contra, so shortnit we the way. Of Osshane syne we passit soon the yle, In Jarsay and Grinisay, within a pretie vhyle, Alongst Ingland, within the Yle of Wight; In at the Nedles our pilot tuke vs right; Furth at Sanct Ilands; and entrit in pace Then to the Douns, vhair that we raid a space. Fra they persaivd the hillis hgih of calk, One to another they begouth to talk: “Thir ar the hillis, surely we suppone, Quharthrou this land is callit Albion.” They daskand farther:—What if the Quene war de[id?] Quha suld be nixt, or to the croun succeid? They follouit furth this argument so far; Syndrie wes sibbe, bot ay ?our Grace wes nar. “Quha wat,” quod they, “bot his Grace may prete[nd?] The thing is ?it far of that God may send. Becaus heirin we na thing vnderstand, We will not ha?ard for to go a land, Leist they perchance micht find some falt in [vs;] As Inglishmen ar very captious. We weyd from thyn, and wald no langer b[yde,] Bot saild alongst the Inglish haill cost sy[de;] The vhilk to vs appeired very fair, Thoght notwithstanding all wes ind and bair; ?et fertill baith for bestiall and corne, Houbeit, or than, that all wes win and shorn[e.] Quharas no rare thing in our way we fand, Quhill we aryvit hard heir at the hand; Quhar that we sau, evin standing in the see, The strongest craig, we thoght, in Christentie; Baith high and stay, when we wer to it come; Thair wes no way vharby it might be clum: And als it stude tua mylis of from the land. Euen thair perchance ane fisher boat we fa[nd;] We speirit at them vhat kind of craig it w[es:] They ansueird vs, that it wes cald The Basse. They sheu us als, vha wes thairof the lord; And hou that men went vp it in a corde; And als, hou tua might keep it weil aneugh. We said na mair, bot come our way, and leugh. “?e sall,” quod they, “sie mony stranger thing, If that ?e chance to trauell with our King.” Then we come sailing to the Porte of Leith. To come right in we thoght it very eith; For other shippis, ather sax or sevin, Had come befor ws thair, in to the hevin. Becaus that we wer nevir thair afore, We tuke the ludging nerest to the shore. I haif bene far, bot ?it in all my lyfe I neuer sau a mirrier hartsum wyfe: “Be blyth,” quod sho, “for ?e sall se our King; God blisse his Grace, and mak him long to ring!” Becaus she saw that it wes groune lait, Sho gart hir boyis come with vs all the gait; Quho broght vs heir, vnto ?our Highnes ?ett, Quharas the court with torches all wes sett, To shau the way vnto ?our Graces hall, That, eftir supper, we might sie the ball. My fellouis comes nou:—I mon mak auay. God blisse ?our Grace! I haif no more to say. XLIX. A CARTELL OF THE THRE VENTROUS KNICHTS. As Ydilnes is mother of all vyce, And Sluggishnes the very sone of shame, So Honour is that only pearle of pryce That leivis to men ane everlasting name, Quhen they ar dead, to live agane by fame, Quharof the gredy Curage evir gloirs. Quhilk wes the caus, we come so far from ha[me,] To knau this Court, vhilk all the world de[coirs;] Quhilk for to sie, we saild by syndry shoirs, And past the perillous gredy gulfe of Perse, And levir sees that syndry shippis devoirs; Quhare is no fish, bot monsters fell and feir[se;] Quhais vgly shappis wer tyrsum to reherse; And mairatour, we come not to that end, To wery ?ou, and wast the day in verse, Quhilk otheruyse we purpose for to spend; As pairtly by our clething may be kend, And vncouth armes, that errant knichts we [ar,] Of forrein lands, vhom Fortun heir hes send, To find thy grace, vhom we haif soght so [far.] Than grant thou vs, befor that we come n[ar,] Thy saiv sure conduct, that we may be frie To prove thy knights. We dout not bot they d[ar,] In play or ernest, be bold to brek a tre. And so, I trou, dar ony of ?on thrie: Bot they are not come heir for sik a thing; Bot rather, for thair Ladyes sake, to se Quha fairest runis, and oftest taks the ring. Go to than, shirs, and let vs streik a sting. Cast crosse or pyle, vha sall begin the play; And let the luifsume Ladyis and the King Decerne, as judges, vha dois best, this day. So, for my pairt, I haif no more to say. God speid ?ou weill, and keip the timber haill! Wait on ?our fortun, vhill sho say ?ou nay. I wish ?ou weill, if Fortun may availl. L. SANG ON THE LADY MARGARET MONTGOMERIE. Luiffaris, leif of to loif so hie ?our ladyes; and thame styell no mair, But peir, the erthlie A per se, And flour of feminine maist fair: Sen thair is ane without compair, Sic tytillis in ?our sanges deleit; And prays the pereles [perle] preclair, Montgomrie, maikles Margareit.

Pigmaleon, that ane portratour, Be painting craft, did sa decoir, Himself thairwith in paramour Fell suddanlie, and smert thairfoir;— Wer he alyve, he wald deploir His folie, and his love forleit, This fairer patrone to adoir Of maidis the maikles Margareit. Or had this nymphe bene in these dayis Quhen Paris judgit in Helicon, Venus had not obtenit sic prayis: Scho, and the goddessis ilk one, Wald have preferrit this paragon, As marrowit, but matche, most meit The goldin ball to bruik alone; Merveling in this Margareit. Quhose nobill birth, and royall bluid, Hir better nature dois exeid.

      <field name="fulltext">DEVOTIONAL POEMS. I. THE FIRST PSALME. Weill is the man, ?ea blissed than, By grace that can Esheu ill counsell and the godles gait; That stands not in The way of sin, Nor does begin To sitt with mockers in the scornefull sait; Bot in Jehovahis lau Delyts aricht, And studies it to knaw, Both day and nicht; For he sall be Lyk to the trie Quhilk plantit by the running river grouis; Quhilk frute does beir In tym of ?eir; Quhais leaf sall never fade nor rute sall louis. His actionis all Ay prosper sall, Quhilk sall not fall To godles men bot as the chaffe or sand, Quhilk day by day Winds dryvis away, Thairfor I say The wicked in the judgment sall not stand; Nor sinners ryse na mair, Vhom God disdanes, In the assembly vhair The just remanes. For why? the Lord Doth beir record; He knauis the richteous conversation ay, And godles gaits, Quhilk he so haitis, Sall doutles perish and decay aluay. II. THE SECONDE PSALME. To the Tone of—“In throu the,” &amp;c. Quhy doth the Heathin rage and rampe, And peple murmur all in vane? The kings on earth ar bandit plane, And princes ar conjoinit in campe, Aganst the Lord and Chryst ilk ane. “Come let our hands Brek all thair bands,” Say they, “and cast from vs thair ?oks.” Bot he sall evin That duells in hevin Laugh thame to scorne, lyk mocking stoks. [In] wraith then sall he speik thame till, And vex thame in his anger sore, And say—“I set my King with glore On Sion Mount, my holy hill.” I will declair his will thairfoir; That is, that he Hes said to me, “Thou art my Sone beloved ay, From vhome my Love Sall not remove; I haif begotten thee this day. Ask thou of me, and thou sall haive The Heathin to enherit haill, And all the earth thou sall not faill For thy possessioun to resaive. Thy princely scepter sall prevaill; For they sall feill It made of steill, To render thame thair just reuaird; Quhairvith thou sall Evin bruis thame all In peces, lyk a potters shaird.” Be wyse, thairfor, ?e kingis, and heir. ?e judges of the earth, I say, Be leirned and instructit ay. Rejoyce and serve the Lord in feir, And kisse the Sone and him obey; Leist, vhen his yre Sall burne as fyre, ?e perish in the way and fall. And sik as trust In God most just Sall happy be and blissed all. III. THE POETS DREME. God give me grace for to begin My spousing garment for to spin, And to be one till enter in With the brydgrome in blisse; And sleep na mair in sleuth and sin, Bot rather ryse and richtly rin That hevinly wedfie for to win Vhilk he prepairs for his. The way is strait, the nomber small; Therfor we may not entir all: ?it he hes said that sik men sall Vhais faith brings furth gude frute. My [saull,] then, fash not for a fall; Contineu knocking; clim and call: Thair is no winning ouer the wall Fra ains the dur be shute. Tak tym in tyme, or tym be tint, To stryve with sin, and nevir stint; And vhar thou may not, mak a mint, Sa that thy faith be fast. As raynie dropis do peirce the flint Throu falling oft, and not throu dint; Of hope if thou hold fast the hint, Thou sall prevaill at last. Presume not, nor dispair to speid. To lyf that leddir sall the leid, Quhilk stude at godly Jacobs heid Quhen he to dream wes drevin; Quhairby the angels come and ?eid From hevin to earth, as thou may reid: That is the only way indeid To help the vp to hevin. Assure thy self, it is the sam Vharby the godly fathers clam, Vha war the heires of Abraham, Beloved of the Lord. If thou beleive into that Lamb Vha said, “I am evin that I am,” The Deuill dou nevir the condam; Thy warand is the word. When he wes rent vpon the rude, He boght belevers with his blude; I mene the godly men and gude Quha keepit his commands, And by instinction vnderstude, Thair saulls resaued his flesh for fude. Then clim by Chryst, for, I conclude, Thy help lyes in his hands. IV. A GODLY PRAYER. Peccavi Pater, miserere mei: I am not worthy to be cald thy chylde, Vho stubburnely haif lookt so long astray, Not lyk thy sone, bot lyk the prodigue wyld. My sillie saull with sin is so defyld, That Satan seeks to catch it as his pray. God grant me grace that he may be begyld: Peccavi Pater, miserere mei. I am abashd how I dar be sa bald Befor thy godly presence to appeir, Or ha?ard anes the hevins to behald, Vha am vnworthy that the earth suld beir. ?it damne me noght vhom thou hes boght so deir; Sed salvum me fac, dulcis Fili Dei, For out of Luk this leson nou I leir, Peccavi Pater, miserere mei. If thou, O Lord, with rigour woldst revenge, Vhat flesh befor the faultles suld be fund? Or vho is he vhois conscience can him clenge, Bot by his birth to Satan he is bund? ?it, of thy grace, thou took auay that grund, And sent thy Sone our penalty to pay, To saiv us from that hiddious hellish hund. Peccavi Pater, miserere mei. I hope for mercy, thoght my sinnes be huge: I grant my gylt, and grones to thee for grace. Thoght I suld flie, vhair sall I find refuge? In hevin, O Lord? thair is thy duelling place. The erth, thy futstule; ?ea in helis, alace! Doun with the dead; bot all must the obey. Thairfor I cry, vhill I haif tyme and space, Peccavi Pater, miserere mei. O gratious God, my gyltines forgive, In sinners death since thou does not delyte, Bot rather that they suld convert and live, As witnessis thy sacred holy wryte. I pray the, then, thy promise to perfyte In me; and I sall with the Psalmist say To pen thy prais, and wondrous works indyte: Peccavi Pater, miserere mei. Suppose I slyde, let me not sleep in sleuth, In stinking sty with Satans sinfull swyn; Bot make my tongue the trompet of thy treuth, And lend my verse sik wings as ar divyne. Sen thou hes grantit me so good ingyn To loif the, Lord, in gallant style and gay, Let me no moir so trim a talent tyne: Peccavi Pater, miserere mei. Thy Spirit, my spirit to speik, with speed, inspyre. Help, Holy Ghost! and be Montgomeries Muse; Flie doun on me in forked tongues of fyre, As thou did, on thy oune Apostills, vse; And with thy fyre me fervently infuse To laud the, Lord, and longer not delay. My former folish fictiouns I refuse: Peccavi Pater, miserere mei. Stoup, stubborne stomock, that hes bene so stout; Stoup, filthie flesh, and carioun of clay; Stoup, hardint hairt, befor the Lord, and lout Stoup, stoup in tyme, defer not day by day. Thou knouis not weill vhen thou man pass away; The Tempter, als, is bissie to betrey. Confes thy sinnes, and shame not for to say, Peccavi Pater, miserere mei. To grit Jehovah let all glore be gevin, Vha shupe my saul to his similitude; And to his Sone, vhom he sent doun from hevin, Vhen I wes lost, to buy me with his blude; And to the Holy Ghost, my gyder gude, Vho must confirme my faith to tak no fray. In me cor mundum crea—I conclude: Peccavi Pater, miserere mei. V. A WALKNING FROM SIN. Think on the end and thou sall seindle sin. Since vnadwysment wraks or thou be war, To call for grace betyms at God begin, Befor thou folou on the flesh too far. Throu vnadvertance, oh! hou mony ar Involvit so vhill out they can not win? Wald thou be clene? touch nather pick nor tar: Think on the end and thou sall seindle sin. As trees hes leafis, then florishis, syn fruit; So thou hes thoghts, syn words, and actions last. Thus, grie by grie, sin taks in the sik rute, Infecting saull and body baith so fast, To stay repentance till the tyme be past. Then turne in tym and not so rekles rin, Or thou thy self in condemnation cast. Think on the end and thou sall seindle sin. Or thou be sommound by vncerten death, Count with thy conscience; knau if it be cle[ne.] Defer not to the latter blast of breath, Sen lait repentance seindle sure is sene. Then thrau the wand in tyme vhill it is grene; Sen tym is precious tak it or ?e tuin. Sen thou began, look bak vhat thou hes bene: Think on the end and thou sall seindle sin. Sen death is debt, prepair thee for to pay; Thou knauis not vhen thy Creditour will crave. Remember death, and on that dreidfull day Quhen as thy saull hir sentence sall resave, Of endles pain or endles joy to haive, The goatis ar many, thoght the lambis be thin: Seek thy salvation; be not Satans slaive; Think on the end and thou sall seindle sin. Seik, knok, and ask in Faith, with Hope and Love, And thou sall find, and enter, and obtene. Obey his blissed bidding from above; So thou sall purchess proffeit, to, betuene. Inclyne thyn eiris, and open wp thy ene To heir and sie; and comfort all thy kin. Do good; repent; in tym to come abstene: Think on the end and thou sall seindle sin. Thoght Natur force thee to commit offence, ?it it is divelish daylie to delyte Or perseveir in, onder this pretence, That Chryst sall be compeld to mak the quyte: As some will say, “Sen flesh is imperfyte, God mon forgive, or think his court bot thin.” These words ar vain—but warrand of the wryt: Think on the end and thou sall seindle sin. VI. A LESONE HOU TO LEIRNE TO DIE. Be war, be war, leist it be war; The dreidfull day drauis to the duris. Exame ?our selfis; sie vhat ?e ar, And spy hou Death comis at the spurris; Whais sharpe seveirest summond sayis: Without contineuing of dayis. He keepis no dyet, day, nor table; Bot vhen he calis thou mon compeir; Euen vhen thou art vnmetest, able. Then fruitles faith is fraught with feir; That message so thy mynd dismayis: Without contineuing of dayis. Quhen all thy sensis the forsaikis, And thou persaivis no dome bot dead, Then courage lyk a couart quaikis; Vane hope dar not hold vp his head; Thy sinfull saull astonisht stayis, Bot no contineuing of dayis. Fra conscience brings furth his books, Into thy stomok is a stryfe. It is no laughter, vhen thou looks Vpon the legend of thy lyfe; Vharin ar writtin all thy wayis, Without contineuing of dayis. That register may mak thee rad, Reveiling both thy good and evill. Thy saull sall sie, to mak hir sad, Hir vgly enemie the Divill; Quhilk all that lybel to hir layis, Without contineuing of dayis. Fra sho haif ga?ed in that glasse, Sho hes a gesse vhair sho suld gang. Be sho provydit, or sho passe— It's weill; if not—all will be wrang. To lait for pardon then sho prayis, Quhen no contineuing of dayis. A bitter battell sall sho byde Betuixt quick hope and dead dispair, Quhen sho sall trimble to be tryde, Remembring on long Euermair; Quhair peirles pain or plesur ay is Without contineuing of dayis. Thoght, word, and deid, all sall be weyde, Befor thy lingring lyf disluge. Vhat ferly, freind, thoght thou be fleyd To go befor so grit a Judge, Vhais feirfull face the wicked frayis, Without contineuing of dayis? Thy beutie, riches, wit, and strenth, Quhilk God thee, to his glory, gaive, Sall caus the cry, Alace! at lenth, Quhen he thy checker compt sall craive; Vho will allou the no delayis, Nor ?it contineuing of dayis. Thair thou, that in this warld wes wont To griev thy God without regaird, Sall be compeld to give account, And as thou thoght resave rewaird Of him vho presently repayis, Without contineuing of dayis. Then prayers, almesdeids, and tearis, Vhilks ?it to skorne ?ee skantly skar, Sall mair availl than jaks and spearis, For to debait thee at that bar Quhair nane rebelis, bot all obeyis, Without contineuing of dayis. Quhen Justice halds the ballance evin, Sho mettis no inshis with the ell. The hevy saulis ar had to hevin; The light, alace, ar hoyde to hell, Quhair Bel?ebub in burning brayis In wter darknes vhair no day is. Quhat wald thou give, if God wold grant Thee longer licience for to leive? Wald thou not sueir to be a sant, And all thy goods for God's saik give; ?ea, and instruct all sik as strayis Without contineuing of dayis? Quhy art thou miserable, O Man? Quhy pretermits thou tyme and place? Quhy art thou ydler nou nor than? Quhy speids thou not vhill thou hes space? Quhy tyins thou tyme, that the betrayis? Quhy dreeds thou not these duilfull dayis? ?it, hear vhill Chryst knokis at thy hairt, And open it to let him in: Or thou sall abill efteruard Crave entrie vhair thou sall not win; As the fyve folish virgins playis: Then with the wyse redeme thy dayis. VII. [AWAY! VANE WORLD.] To the Toon of—“Sall I let hir go,” &amp;c. Auay! vane world, bewitcher of my hairt! My sorouis shauis my sins maks me to smart; ?it will I not dispair, Bot to my God repair: He has mercy ay, Thairfor will I pray: He hes mercy ay, and lovis me, Thoght by his humbling hand he provis m[e.] Auay, auay! too long thou hes me snaird; I will not tyne more tyme: I am prepaird Thy subtill slychts to flie, Vhilks hes allured me. Tho they sueitly smyle, Smoothly they begyle: Tho they sueitly smyle, I feir thame. I find thame fals; I will forbeir thame. Once more, auay! shauis loth the world to le[ave:] Bids oft adeu with it that holds me slave. Loth am I to forgo This sueet alluring fo: Sen thy wayis ar vane, Sall I the retane? Sen thy wayis ar vane, I quyt thee; Thy plesuris sall no more delyt me. A thousand tymis auay!—Oh! stay no more. Sueit Chryst, conduct, leist subtile sin devore. Without thy helping hand No man hes strenth to stand. Tho I oft intend All my wayis to mend— Tho I oft intend, strength fails ay: The sair assaults of sin prevailis ay. Quhat sal I say? ar all my plesurs past? Sall worldly lustis nou tak thair leiv at last? ?ea, Chryst, these earthly toyes Sall turne in hevinly joyes. Let the world be gone; I'l love Chryst allone. Let the world be gone—I cair not: Chryst is my love alone—I feir not. VIII. [COME, MY CHILDRENE DERE, DRAU NEIR ME.] Come, my Childrene dere, drau neir me, To my Love vhen that I sing; Mak ?our ears and hairts to heir me, For it is no eirthly thing, Bot a love Far above Other loves all, I say, Vhich is sure To indure Vhen as all things sall decay. O my Lord and Love most loyal, Vhat a prais does thou deserve! Thoght thou be a Prince most Royal, With thy Angels thee to serve, ?it a pure Creature Thou hes lovit al thy lyfe; Thou didst chuis The refuis Of the world to be thy wyfe. Whill I did behold the favor Of his countenance so fair— Whill I smellit the sueet savor Of his garments rich and rair— “Oh!” I said, “If I had, To my Love, ?on Prince of Glore! For my chose Wold I lose Other loves I lovd befor.” Vhill I did these words besyd me, With a secreit sigh, confes, Lo! my Lord and Love espyd me, And dreu neir me vhair I wes; Then a ring Did he thring On my finger, that wes fyne:— “Tak,” quod he, “This to the, For a pledge that I am thyne. Nou thou hes that thou desyrit— Me to be thy Lord and Love— All the thing that thou requyrit, To the heir, I do approve: ?it agane, For my pane, Only this I crave of thee; For my pairt, Keep thy hairt As a virgin chast to me.” IX. HIS MORNING MUSE. [NON TARDES CONVERTI AD DEUM.] Let dread of pain for sin in aftertime, Let shame to see thy self ensnared so, Let grief conceived for foul accursed crime, Let hate of sin, the worker of thy wo, With dread, with shame, with grief, with hate, enforce To dew thy cheeks with tears to deep remorse. So hate of sin shall make God's love to grow; So grief shall harbour hope within thine heart; So dread shall caus the flood of joy to flow; So shame shall send sweet solace to thy smart: So love, so hope, so joy, so solace sweet Shall make my soul in heavenly bliss to fleet. Wo, where no hate doth no such love allure! Wo, where such grief makes no such hope proceed! Wo, where such dread doth not such joy procure! Wo, where such shame doth not such solace breed! Wo, where no hate, no grief, no dread, no shame No love, no hope, no joy, no solace frame! X. PSALME XXXVI. DECLINA A MALO, ET FAC BONUM. Leave sin, ere sin leave thee; do good, And both without delay; Less fit he will to morrow be, Who is not fit to day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE MINDES MELODIE. PSALME I. Blest is the man, ?ea, happie than, By grace that can Eschew ill counsell and the godles gates; And walkes not in The way of sin, Nor doth begin To sit with mockers in the scornful sates; Bot in Iehovaes law Delites aright, And studies it to knaw Both day and night. That man shall bee Like to the tree Fast planted by the running river growes; That frute doth beare, In tyme of ?eare; Whose leafe shall neuer fade, nor rute vnlouse. His actions all Ay prosper shall: Which shall not fall The godles men; bot as the calfe or sand, That, day by day, Winde driuth away: Therefore, I say, The wicked in the judgement shall not stand; Nor sinners rise na mair, Whom God disdaines, In the assemblie where The just remaines. For why? the Lord, Who bearth record, Doth know the righteous conuersations ay; And godles gates, Which he so hates, Shall quite die, perish, and doubtlesse decay. PSALME IIII. To thee I call, In my great thrall And troubles all: Hear me, O Lord, my God of righteousnesse. Of mercie free, Thou hast set mee At libertie. Haue mercie, Lord, and rid me from distresse. O men of mortall name, How long will ?ee My glorie turne to shame, With vanitie? O sonnes of men, Why doe ?e then Seeke after lies, with the vngodly ghuest? The Lord aboue Doth surelie loue The godlie man, and heareth my request. In aw therefore, Giue God the glore, And sinne no more, With quyet mynde examine well ?our heart. ?our sweete incense Of innocence With confidence Bring to the Lord: ?our selves to him conuert. The worldlie wretch, all day, Doth neuer cease For well and wealth to pray, This life to ease. Bot thou, thy grace And louing face, With brightfull beames, make on vs, Lord, to shine. Graunt vs thy light And fauour bright. We pray the, Lord, thine eare to vs incline. With heart and voice I will rejoice; And make my choise Of this thy grace, before all worldlie care. This treasure grit Doth me delite With joy perfite, More than the wretch for al his goods and gear; As granes and grapes so gay, In tyme of ?eare, That filles his heart, I say, With joyfull cheare. In rest and peace I find release; And wil ly down, and sleepe with sound repose: For thou, my guarde, And sure rewarde, My help, my hope, doest keep me from my foes. PSALME VI. Lord, I requyre, That, in thine yre Fuming as fyre, Thou me no wayes rebuke, nor ?et reject. Though I doe swerue, And so deserue That I should sterue, In mercie, Lord, I pray thee ?et correct. For griefe and anguish hes Me so opprest, That in my weary bones I find no rest. My soule and mynde Are so sore pynde, That it I can expresse in no degree. O Lord, I say, How long delay Wilt thou, to cure my woe and miserie? Let thy sweete face And wonted grace, In tyme and space Returne, to free my soule from all her paine: Not for no thing That she can bring, That is condigne; Bot for thy mercie freely made her gaine. For why? amongst the dead Who shall thee praise? Shall dust and asse in earth Thy glorie blaise? My plaintes trewlie So grieuous be, That I am like to swerue, I am so faint. All night I greet; My couch I weet With trickling tears, gusht out with my complaint. Mine eyes dim bee, And will not see My sinne trewlie; And griefe hes so possest my heauie heart, For feare of those That be my foes, And would rejoise To see my wreak, and would my soule subuert. Bot now—away, all ?e That wicked be! For the Lord he hath heard My plaint and crie; And not onelie He hath heard me, Bot granted my request and whole desyre, And shall my foes In tyme disclose, And them confound with shame in his hote yre. PSALME VIII. Iehova, Lord, Who can record, In writ or word, Thy name so great on earth and euerie where? Which thou hast plaist, As pleasde thee best, And worthiest, Aboue the heauens and christall cleared aire. Thou makes thy laude and praise, Thy strength and might, From breath of babes to rise, Both day and night. In suckling anes Thy grace remaines For to be seene, and beautie excellent; The mouth to close Of godlesse foes, That readie are to slay the innocent. When I behold The high heauens mould, That doth vnfold Thy wondrous works by thy owne fingers wrought; The moone so bright, And starrie light, That shines by night, With gleaming fires, all formed out of noght; What thing is mortal wight, Then do I say, Of whome thou, Lord of might, Are myndfull ay? The sonne of man, What is he than, Whom thou by grace doest choose and beautifie? ?et little lesse, I must confesse, Thou hast him made, than angels, in degree; And thou his name And glorious frame Exalts with fame, And crownes his head with royall Majestie; And, as a King, Him sets, to raigne Ouer euerie thing, That life, breath, forme, and shape, hath taine of thee; As sheepe, oxe, horse, and beast That feeds on land; ?ea, all such things are preast At his command; The fishe that swym With out-spred fin, And fowls, each one, that haunt into the aire: Iehova, Lord, Who can record Thy name, so great on earth and euery wher? PSALME XV. O Lord, who shall Thy tent indwall Celestiall? Who shall abide within thine holie hill? That walks in light, And doth that's right, With all his might; His brother's name doth not reproach and spill; Nor ?et can heare his fame, In any sort, To be imparde with blame Or false report: That doth abstaine From euerie meane And wrongful way to work his neighbour wo; And in whose sight The wicked wight, That God despytes, despyted is also: Bot such as loue The Lord aboue, He doth approue, And honours them with loue and reuerence: That band doth make, And will not breake, For loose nor lacke That may ensue, nor any such pretence; Nor ?et doth put his coyne To vsurie; Nor the just cause purloyne, Through bryberie. Who means, right so, These thinges to do, And steadfastlie doth keepe the perfite way; As Syon Hill He shall stand still, And neuer moue, nor perishe, or decay. PSALME XIX. The firmament, And heauens out-stent, So excellent, Thy handywork and glorious praise proclaim: Each day to day Succeeding ay In their array, And night to night, by course, doe preache the same. No sound of breath nor speach Of men haue they, ?et eueriewhere they preache Thy praise, I say. Their lyne goeth out The earth about: Their voice is heard throughout the world so wide. There he a throne Set for the sunne, And paylion plight, his mansion to abide; Who, like a groome Of great renoume, Right braue doth come From chamber straight, with comlie countenance; Or, like a knight In pleasant plight, Doth haste with might To runne the race, his honor to aduance. His rysing and his race, It doth appeare Euen from the out-most space Of heauens spheare. Then hes he taine His course againe, Through a?urde sky, by reuolution right. Nothing can be Hid from the eye And burning beames of that great lampe of light. God's word is cleare; His law sinceere, And most enteere, The sinfull soule to him for to conuert: His precepts pure, Both firme and sure, And can allure, And make right wise the sober simple heart. Thy ways and statutes all Are righteousnesse, Which glad the soules in thrall, With joyfulnesse: They giue cleare light To our blinde sight. Thy feare is pure, and euer permanent: Thou cannot rew: Thy judgments trew And righteous are, O Lord Omnipotent. Much gold of price, Refyned twyce, ?ea, more than thryce, Is not in worth with them for to be valude: The honie white, Pure and perfite, Mouing delite, Is not so sweete, nor so much to be craued. They make thy seruants wise And circumspect; And, what to enterprise, They him direct. In keeping them, Great is the gaine, And rich rewarde, for such lade vp for euer. Bot who can count Sinnes that surmount? From secreet sins, good Lord, my soule deliuer. O Lord, vouchsaue, I humblie craue, Me for to saue, And cleanse my hart from proud presumptuous sin: Then shall I bee From sinnes set free, That troubles mee. Preserue me, Lord, that I walke not therein; And let them not preuaile, Me to possesse: Then I will, without faile, Loue righteousnesse. Accept my plaint, Which I present Before thy sight, with humble hart and voice. My strength and stay Thou art for ay, And Sauiour sweete, in whom I do rejoyce. PSALME XXIII. The Lord most hie, I know, will be An heyrde to me: I can not long haue stresse, nor stand in neede. He makes my leare In feelds so fare, That without care I doe repose, and at my pleasure feede. He sweetlie me conuoyes To pleasant springes, Where nothing me annoyes, But pleasure bringes. He giues my minde Peace in such kinde, That feare of foes nor force can not me reaue. By him I am lead In perfite tread; And, for his name, he will me neuer leaue. Though I should stay, Euen day by day, In deadlie way, ?et would I be assurde, and fear no ill; For why? thy grace, In euerie place, Doth me imbrace; Thy rod and shiphirds-crook comforts me still. In despyte of my foe, My table growes. Thou balmes my head with ioy: My cuppe ouerflowes: Kindnesse and grace, Mercie and peace, Shall follow me, for all my wretched dayes; Then endles joy Shall me conuoy To heauen, where I with thee shall be alwaies. PSALME XLIII. O Lord of grace, Iudge thou my cace: From thy high place, My cause reuenge against my deadlie foes. From wicked traine Of fraudfull men That thee misken, Saue me, O Lord, for I in thee rejoise. Thou art my God and aide, My strength and stay; Why go I then dismaide In this array? Why shouldst thou mee Reject from thee, As pray to those that seeke my soul to spill? Send out thy light, Thy treuth, and right; And guide my wayes vnto thy holie hill: Then will I to Thine altar goe, Not fearing foe, With harp in hand, to sing thy praise for euer. My God so deare, My joy and cheare, Who doest me heare, With readie help do now my soule deliuer. My soule, why doest thou freate Thus in my breast, With grudging griefe ouer-set, Not taking rest? In God most just Set all thy trust; And call on him with all thy stresse and greefe. I will alwayes Him laude and praise: He is my God, my helpe, my whole releefe. PSALME LVII. Have reuth on me— Haue reuth on me, O Lord, from hie, Haue mercy, Lord: in thee my soule doth trust: Vntill at last This stormie blast Be ouer-past, In shadow of thy winges my hope shall rest. On God most high I call, My heart's delyte; Who will his promise all To me perfite. From heauen's throne, He will send downe, And saue me from the sharp rebuke and shame Of cruell foes That me inclose: His mercie sure shall keepe me from al blame. I lie beset With lyons net; And men are met, In fyrie rage, my seelie soule to catch; Whose teeth, I weene, Like arrowes keene Are to be seene; Their tongues like swordes, some mischeef for to hatch. Exalt thy selfe, therefore, The heauens aboue: On earth shew forth thy glore, And power proue. A snare is made, And grins are laide, My steps to trap, my fate to fold withall. I am opprest: A ditche is drest For me—bot, loe! my foes therein doe fall. My heart is bent, And permanent, With full intent To praise the Lord, and to extoll his name. “My tongue,” alway “Awake,” I say, By breake of day: “My harpe, in haste, and viole, doe the same.” I will thee praise among The people all: As God and Lord most strong Thee praise I shall. Thy mercies grit, And treuth perfite Doe reache vnto the heauens and cloudie sky: Exalt, therefore, Thy name and glore Aboue the clouds and limites of the day. PSALME XCI. Who doth confyde, And so abyde, All tyme and tyde, In secreete and in shade of the Most High, He may well say, “God is my stay And strength alway— My faith, my hope, in whom my trust doth lie.” He shall thee keepe and fence From hunter's snare, From cruell pestilence, And all such feare; And shall the hide On euerie side, In shadow safe and couert of his winges: His treuth, most sure Ay to indure, Thy sheeld shal be, against all noysome things. Thou shalt not care For any feare, By night or eare; Or, noone-day bright, for the swift fleing dart: No fearefull pest That may molest By night shall rest On thee; nor plague by day that falles athwart. Although a thousand men, Before thine eye— Yea, more than thousands ten, Should fall hard by; None ill at all Shall thee befall; No dangerous death, nor dread shall come thee neare: Bot wicked anes, That God disdaines, He will rewarde; as thou shalt see most clear. Be not affraide, Sence thou hast said, “God is mine aide,” And the Most High hast set for thy refuge. No harme nor hurt Within thy court Shall doe thee sturt; No skaith shall come within thy tent to ludge: For he his angels bright Hath geuen command, To keep thee, day and night, On euerie hand; And, by their arme, To saue from harme, And stay thy steps from stumbling at a stone. Thou shalt down-tread The dragon's head— The lyons fearce—the aspes—their ?ong, each one; Because the Lord, Of his accord, Hath said the word:— “I will him saue and send deliuerance. He doth adore, And loue my glore; I will therefore Him,” saith the Lord, “to honor high aduance. When he shall on me call In tyme of neede, I will from dangers all Rid him with speede; And him defend And succour send, In troubles all; and then him glorifie I will alwayes Prolong his dayes; And he, doubtlesse, my sauing health shall see.” PSALME CI. Now will I sing To thee, O King, Aboue all thing, Of mercie mixt with judgement righteous. In perfite way, I will me stay; Awaiting ay Vntill thou come, my God most gratious. In mynde and heart vpright, I will begin To walke before thy sight, My house within. No wickednesse Shall me possesse. The sinner's worke I hate with all disdaine. Nor ill at all Shall with me dwall; Mine heart, mine hand, from such I will refrain. Thou froward heart, That workes me smart, From me depart; Go take thy leaue; for I no ill will know. Such as defame, With slanderous blame, Their neighbour's name, I will destroy, and them no mercie show. The proud presumptuous ghuest, With loftie looke, And hautie minde possest, I can not brooke. Myne heart, myne eye, Shall euer be Vpon the just and faithfull of the land. They shall abyde All tyme and tyde Within thy court, to serue at thy command: The man, I say, That doth not stray From the right way, I will aduance, in honour to excell. The guilefull man, That no good can, Bot lie and faine, Out of mine house with speed I will expell. I will cut out, by tyme, Out of the land, All the rebellious trayne And godlesse band. And I doe meane For to maintaine God's holie house, and sacred cittie, free; That wicked men May not remaine Within his gates, for their iniquitie. PSALME CXVII. O nations all, Both great and small, With Israell, Vnto the Lorde, sing laude and lasting praise: Exalt his name, And glorious fame Alwhere proclame; For why? his grace and glore abides alwaies: He doth his tender loue To vs extend; As well, each day, we proue: It hath no end. This mightie Lord, In worke and word, Is constant, sure; his treuth cannot decay. Giue him, therefore, All laude and glore, Who doth on vs his loue and grace display. PSALME CXXI. When I behold These montanes cold, Can I be bold To take my journey through this wildernesse, Wherein doth stand, On eyther hand, A bloudie band, To cut me off with cruell craftinesse? Heere, subtle Sathan's slight Doth me assaill: Ther, his proud worldly might Thinks to preuaill. In euerie place, With pleasant face, The snares of sinne besets me round about; With poysone sweete To slay the spirite, Conspyred all, to take my life, no doubt. But God is hee Will succour mee, And let me see His sauing health ay readie at command: Euen Iehova, That creat al, Both great and smal, In heauen and aire, and in the sea and land. Freat not, my fearefull heart, My breast within: This God will take thy part, Thy course to rin. He will thee guyde; Thou shalt not slyde; Thy feet shall steadfast stand in the right way: He will thee keepe; He will not sleepe, Nor suffer foes to catch thee as a pray. The Lord doth keepe Israel his sheepe, And will not sleepe. Beneath his shadow thou shalt saiflie ly. Right sure and firme, With his right arme, Saue the from harme He shall; and all thy fearefull foes defy. The day, hote sunnes offence Shall not thee greeue; Nor cold moones influence, By night, the moue. God, of his grace, From his high place, Shall saue thee from all ill: in euerie way Thou goes about, Both in and out, He shall the blesse and prosper, now and ay. PSALME CXXV. As Sion Hill, That's firme and still, And neuer will Nor can remoue, through danger of decay, So that man shall, Lord, with thee dwall, Fearing no fall, Who trustes in thee; and shall indure for ay. Like mountaines round about Ierusalem, Iehova so, no doubt, Shall couer him. The rod and ?ocke Of God's owne flocke Shall not ay rest vpon the godlie race; Lest they, through griefe, Without releefe, The wandring waies of wicked men imbrace. O Lord, our God, Remoue thy rod! Make not abode From such as feare thy name with perfite hart, And walke vpright, Before thy sight, In thy trew light: Thy grace, their guyde, let not from them depart. Bot such as slide abacke In crooked wayes, The Lord shall ouertake, With sudden frayes: Their lot and part Shall be, in smart, With sinfull men, that perishe in thy rage. With Israell, Thy peace let dwell, O blessed Lord! to last from age to age. PSALME CXXVIII. O blest is hee That feareth thee, O Lord, most hie, And doth obserue thy constant will and way! O well to him That hath begun This course to run! His labour shall him pleasant frute repay. To his great joyes encrease, In reuthfull neede, Iehova will him dresse, His life to feede. His wife shall bee Like to the tree That growes full gay, fast by his houses side: His children fair, Like olyues rare, His table shall decore, both tyme and tyde. Such man's successe And happinesse Shall still increase, As feares thee, O Lord most righteous: Thou will not misse Right so to blesse Both him and his, With riches rare, and pleasure plenteous. From Sion's holie Hill, Thou shalt see then, To stand, and flourish still, Ierusalem. Thy race and seede Shall budde and breed, Before thine eyes, in happie state and store. With Israell And Iuda, shall Thy peace, O Lord, abyde for euer more. THE SONG OF SIMEON. S. Luke, 2. verse 25. Since that mine eye, Before I die, O Lord doth see Thine holie one—our hope and onelie stay— Whom thou hast send, In latter end, For to extend Thy mercies great, that doe endure for ay; Then let thy seruant, Lord, Depart in peace; And me, of thine accord, Send to my place; As thou hast said, And promise made, That can not faile nor fall in vaine away: For I rejoyce, In heart and voyce, That I haue seene thy sauing health this day; Whom thou, a light, Hast set, full bright, Before the sight Of Gentiles far, and people round about; And sendst with grace, Sinne to deface, And glorious peace For to proclame, the earth and world throughout; And, as thy prophetes told, A signe to bee, For nations to behold With faithfull eye; In speciall Thine Israel To rid from thral, and saue them by his might; That he, their glore, For euer more On Sion Hill may shine in beautie bright. GLORIA PATRI. O King of Kings, In heauen that rings Aboue all things, Thy people chosen of thine onelie grace, To raigne with thee Eternallie, Them sanctifie, Into thy sweete and euerlasting peace. Laude to the Trinitie, On which we call! Our God, in persons three, Surmounting all. Fountaine profound! All praise redound To thee, O Father, with thy Son most sweete! That Prince of glore Did vs restore; Likewise all praise be to the Holie Spirite! Gloria in excelsis Deo. Amen.</field>

Blind boy! thou dois so beir My fortoun in ballance, I flow from houp to feir, From feir till esperance: Now thair, now heir, Now peace, now weir, Chainging my cheir, As chaingis ay my chance.
