      <field name="fulltext">V. Elegiacs. By ARTHUR J. MUNBY, M. A., Trin. Coll., Cambridge. ONE OF THE SIX RECOMMENDED FOR PUBLICATION BY THE JUDGES AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE COMPETITION. Once in a hundred years, when the ebb of creation has fallen Quite from our arid sands into its ocean afar, When every loathsome thing, long hid by the merciful waters, Warm in the stagnant pools, flounders and wallows at ease; Sudden the tide sets in, and the irresistible billows Roll at a single bound up to the headlands again. Once in a hundred years, when the seed of the bigot and worldling Crawl o'er our fragrant earth, taking its beauties in vain, Seeing the worst is come, the God and Father of all men Out of his heaven of love—lest we forget him and die— Sends us a soul of his own, whom all men claim for a brother, Saying, “This is a Man, this is a Poet indeed!” So, on a day like this, when the roar of our century slumber'd Still in its vaulted abyss, mute as the dulness above, When on their baseless thrones, forgetting the Lord who had made them, Kings of the earth sat as gods, binding the people at will, He whom we love was born—was born to the life of a poor man, Cursed with the anguish of song, blest with its beauty alone. Not in some grand old gorge in the heart of the musical Highlands, Fill'd with the torrent's spray, wild with the wailing of winds,— Not by the western isles, where the galloping surge of the ocean, Rich with a thousand wrecks, lashes the land of the Gael; But on the banks of Doon, where the voiceless waters of Ayrshire Moved through a silent vale, trod by no singers of old; There was he born: and he came like a knight to the bride of his bosom, Blessing with exquisite words her who had tarried for him. Oh for a heart of fire, for a voice of the marvellous Hebrews, Moulding their ancient tongue into the grace of a psalm; Singing of Abraham old and Sarah the mother of nations Dwelling in tented peace, walking with God in the way! So would we sing of that home in the pastoral valleys of Scotland, Where from a cradle of reeds he, the immortal, arose; So would we sing too of him, the earnest labouring father, Who by the Bridge of Doon built him a cottage of clay; Priest in his house and king, who pray'd to the God of his fathers, Breathing instinctive love e'en through a puritan creed; Who in the barren fields, with Poverty stalking behind him, Turn'd on the foe like a man, wrestled and suffer'd and fell— Yet by his ingle at night, with his wife and children about him, Order'd his household well, teaching them lessons of hope; Teaching them lessons of joy, for his soul was steadfast within him, Strong in its antique faith, calm with impregnable peace. Such was the home of Burns; so simple and tenderly serious Came the sweet Spirit of Song over the life of her child: Silently came she at first, with the breath of her healthiest breezes Bracing his boyish limbs, making him apt to enjoy; Then would she lead him forth, and over the hills, as he wander'd, Show'd him her glorious noons, show'd him her treasures of eve, Show'd him at length her haunts, the woods of her pleasant seclusion, Woods by the waterside, shadow'd and stilly and cool: There, among innocent birds, and creatures that sport in the green sward, Taught him the wonder of life, taught him to pity and save; Taught him to cling to and love with a boundless passionate ardour All that is lovely on earth—Freedom, and Nature, and Man. Think of him thus for awhile, as he follow'd his plough on the uplands, Driving the furrow aside only to shelter a worm; Think of him striding abroad, with his hand in the bag of the sower, Lavishly shedding the grain over the breast of the glebe, But with his heart elsewhere—careering aloft with the skylark, Or with the startled hare hurrying into the fern: Think of him too that day in the harvest-field with the reapers, Binding the corn as it fell under the sweep of the blade; Not by himself he wrought, for a blooming barefooted maiden Bent at his side, and still mingled her shadow with his: So at the last he woke, with the thrilling touch of a woman, And from her artless eyes caught the clear lightning of song. Many a time thenceforth did he learn from the liberal Muses Rhythmical thoughts most sweet, which in their rustic array Blush'd with a brighter grace, as the frosted gold of the wine-cup Heightens the polish within, deepens the glow of the wine: Many a lay did he glean from his hours of want and oppression— Lays that were stolen and sung oft by the fire at eve, Lays that he frugally hid, or scatter'd in childish abundance, Ignorant still of his wealth, careless of honour and greed. But when the days were come, the time of his fated appearing, When to the world he gave all that a poet can bring— Days of immortal woe! Ah why should we set them to music, Since they are writ in our hearts, since we can never forget? Can we forget how he flash'd like a sunbeam into the city, Dazing its quiet hordes, startling its elegant few? How through the gamut of Life he swept with the ease of a singer, Ringing each note to the full, clear as a bugle in war? How, when the crowd rush'd in, and the gay and the wealthy adored him, He in the midst sat firm, lost not an inch of himself; Rising at length unharm'd, like Excalibur out of the waters, Which on its shining blade left but a glitter of dew: How, when he ask'd but to live, and to live for the glory of Scotland, She to his delicate soul gave but the work of a drudge; Lashing her Ariel down, till instead of the elves of the moonlight, Fiends of the moonless dark rose to his presence at will: How, when the man who had pass'd unscathed through the fury of favour, Wrestling with passion and self, slipt in his blindness awhile, They who had trampled his pearls swift turn'd on the giver to rend him; Till, being weary of life, weak with a noble decay, He at the foot of his fame, of the “upright pillar” of Honour, Wrapt in his mantle of pride, fell, like a hero, alone:— Oh, it is written at large in the book of a nation's repentance— All that she gain'd from him, all that he suffer'd through her; And, in the gloom of her grief, the errors and sins of her darling Seem but as motes in the sun, mists on the ocean of love. Tell me, then, why do we weep for Burns, the beloved of nations? Why through a hundred years still do we love him so well? Why are we gather'd to-day in the aisles of this mighty cathedral, Not for its floral shrines, not for its wonders of art, Not for its saints and kings, nor the magic of beauty around us; But to delight in him, telling his praises aloud?— Hush! 'tis a mystic hour, for the soul of the mighty departed Fills the unconscious air, broods with its blessing above: Well may we ask of our hearts, and well may they fervently answer, Now in this moment of awe, why they have held him so dear! Is it because he was great—of a large majestical presence, Keen with observant eyes, bright with a wavering smile? Is it because he was poor, the son of illiterate peasants, And from the clods of clay sprang to his fame at a bound? Others have done so as well—have swung through the arc of ambition, And at the height of its curve leapt into glory at once: Is it because he was wrong'd—was shunn'd by the men who had sought him, Taunted with guilt not his own, left, when he totter'd, to fall? Others have been so as well—yea, have writhed when some squatted obscene thing Over their fair white robes spirted its venom and fled: Is it because he was blest with the heart and the tongue of a freeman, Daring to feel, and more, daring to utter and do? Others have been so as well—full many a treasured apostle Lies in our sacred soil, speaks to us still from the grave: Is it because he was cursed with the ban of a traitorous priesthood, Who on the throne of God rear'd the Colossus of hell? Others have been so, alas!—from the inaccessible Shakespeare Down to the bards who sing under his shadow to us: Or is it this, that he came like a crown'd unfetter'd Prometheus, Kindling all thoughts of his time into the fire of song? Truly he did it;—but yet, through the length and the breadth of our island, Others have done it as well—others are doing it now. No—there is something more than the mournful romance of his rising, More than his patriot's heart, more than his music of love; Deeper than all, there lies one sweet irrepressible instinct Which through a hundred years makes that we cling to him still:— 'Tis, that he just was A Man—a man in the midst of his brethren, Human in all his ways—human, and yet how divine! He was a man like us—a saint by turns and a sinner, Striving with horrors within, yearning for light from above: Yea, and the Light has come, and the faults are forgiven for ever, Lost in the blaze of Love, drown'd in the welcome of Home! Therefore, because his heart lies open and quivering before us, Shaken with pangs of grief, vivid with thrills of delight, Therefore, we love him so well,—for his weakness as well as his wonder,— Not that he struggled alone, but that he struggled and fell; So that, as brothers and friends, we can bask in the sun of his genius, Prizing its rosy warmth more than its splendour of noon:— Therefore, though evil and few were the days of the years of his sojourn— Though not his true brave soul, neither his noble desires, Neither his poignant wit, and his wondrous Aurora of fancies, Neither his genial heart, mellow and ripe to the core; Though none of these could avail to lengthen the path of his sunset— He is immortal still, safe in his Eden afar: Safe in the breasts of his kind, for where freemen are gather'd together There shall his name be known, there shall his spirit appear— Moving in eloquent flame from the depths of Canadian forests Down to the tropic floods, over the isles of the sea, Over the southern main to the grand Australian empire, Thence by those scented shores round into freedom again; But, in his own dear land, never flickering once for an instant— Still on a stalwart race steadily shining and fair; Shining on heather and hill, from the snow—cover'd shores of the Orkneys Down over baffled Tweed into the Marches of old— Down by the fatted farms and the populous cities of England, Down where the western cliffs throb to the shock of the wave. So shall the peasant-bard, the first-born son of the people, Come to his own once more, sing to his fellows again: Till from the young men's lips and the tuneable throats of the maidens Ever the soul of Burns passes in music away.</field>
