      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. TO THE MEMORY OF HIS MUCH BELOVED AND LAMENTED FRIEND, JAMES CURRIE, M. D. THE FOLLOWING POEMS, AS A LAST TRIBUTE TO HIS VIRTUES, ARE INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR. VERSES ADDRESSED TO HECTOR MACNEILL, ESQ. AUTHOR OF WILL AN' JEAN. The following Verses possess such merit, and are so fine a tribute to the memory of a deceased and favourite Scottish Poet, that, rather than withhold them from the lovers of genuine poetry, the Author thus subjects himself to the imputation of vanity in publishing the elegant, though unmerited, compliment they contain. ‘The daisy flower may blaw unseen On mountain tap—in valley green! The rose alane, in native sheen, Its head may raise! Nae musing bardie now, I ween, To sing their praise! ‘Nae pensive minstrel wight we see Gang saunt'ring o'er the claver lee! The fireflaughts dartin' frae his ee The wilds amang! Wha native freaks wi' native glee Sae sweetly sang! ‘His was the gift, wi' magic power, To catch the thought in happy hour; To busk his verse wi'ilka flower O'fancy sweet! An' paint the birk or brushwood bower, Whar lovers meet! ‘But now he fills his silent ha’! My sweetest minstrel's fled awa!— Yet shall his weel-worn laurels blaw Through future days, Till weary time in flenders a' The warld lays!’ Such was the dowie plaint o'wae Which Scotia made by bank an' brae, Whan Burns—(puir Burns!) was ta'en away, And laid at rest!— (Green grow the grass!—light lie the clay Upon his breast!) But now she draps the waefu' tale, And notes o'transport fill the gale; Nae langer down the silent vale She lanely mourns, And to her cheek, ance lily pale, The rose returns! The streaks o'joy glint in her face, Thy steps, Macneill, sweet bard! to trace; To mark wi' nature's peerless grace Thy blossoms blaw! Happy to see thee fill the place O'him awa! How sairlie does her bosom beat At puir misfortune's wretched state! While tracing Will through poortith great And prospects drear! And at thy Jeanie's hapless fate She draps a tear! Then mark, sweet minstrel o'the day! Thy Scotia's sons an' maidens gay; Her deep wild glens; her mountains grey, Wi' misty head; And eke her ilka sunny brae Wi' flow'rs o'erspread! What time alane thou may'st retire, May these thy fairy thoughts inspire, And set thy manly saul on fire In Scotia's praise; And mak thee strike thy native lyre To saftest lays! To wake the pangs Despair maun dree, Whan driven houseless o'er the lee; To strike the strings o'Sympathie. Whan griefs combine; To start the tear in Pity's ee? The task be thine. Edinburgh, October 11. 1799. Richard Gall. THE HARP, A LEGENDARY TALE. IN TWO PARTS. Smeirg a loisgeadh a thiompan ria. PART I. Still'd is the tempest's blust'ring roar; Hoarse dash the billows of the sea;— But who on Kilda's dismal shore Cries—“Have I burnt my Harp for thee!” 'Tis Col, wild raving to the gale, That howls o'er heath, and blasted lea; Still as he eyes the lessening sail, Cries—“Have I burnt my Harp for thee!”— —Bright was thy fame in Bara's isle, Sweet bard! where many a rival sung; Oft hadst thou waked the tear and smile, As soft thy Harp melodious rung: Oft hadst thou touched the female heart, (To love, I ween! and pity true) Till Mora came to hear thy art;— Mora, with eye of softening blue. The maid he prized above the throng, That pressed to hear his raptured strain;— The maid, who melted at the song, But trifled with a lover's pain: Long had he borne the treach'rous smile, That cherished hope, and left despair; The promised bliss, which female guile As oft dispersed in empty air; Till shunned by every constant maid; Condemned by friends; by kindred prest; Deceitful thus, in smiles arrayed, Mora the sorrowing youth addrest: “Too long, O Col! in plaintive moan Thou'st strung thy Harp to strains divine;— Add but two strings of varied tone, This heart, this yielding heart, is thine.” Two strings the youth, with anxious care, Half doubtful, to his Harp applies; And oft, in vain, he turns each air, And oft each varying note he tries; At length (unrivalled in his art!) With new-born sounds the valley rings;— Col claims his Mora's promised heart, As deep he strikes the varied strings! Three moons, three honied moons, are past Since Col, enraptured, laughed at care: And oft the tuneful Harp he blest, That won a nymph so good and fair: Till mindful of those tender ties, That fashion's sons would blush to name; With softened voice, and melting sighs, He thus accosts his peerless dame: “Three months, dear partner of my bliss! Three fleeting months have shed their charms, Since first I snatched the bridal kiss, And clasped perfection to my arms: “Yet happiness, however true, Must fade, if selfish and confined;— Your friends now claim affections due; The kindred transports of the mind! “Each parent mourns our cold delay; They think of Mora with a tear: The gale invites—at early day To Cana's sea-beat shore we steer.” The morn blushed fair; mild blew the gale; The lark to heaven light warbling springs; Col smiles with love, spreads quick the sail, And sweeps with ravished heart the strings! But ah! how short the transient gleams, That light with joy the human breast!— The tempest raves, and wildly screams Each frighted sea-fowl to her nest. High rage the billows of the deep, That lately rolled serenely mild, And dashed near Kilda's awful steep; Col clasps his love with horror wild. For cold's the form, o'er which he hung With raptured eye the morn before; And mute and tuneless is the tongue, That charmed so late on Bara's shore; And pale and lifeless is the cheek, That glowed so late with rosy hue; The eye, that melting joys could speak, Is closed!—the eye of soft'ning blue. Hard with the furious surge he strove, His love and fav'rite Harp to save; Till deep in Crona's sea-worn cove, He bears them safe from storm and wave. But cove, nor love's assiduous care Could ebbing life's warm tide restore!— Pale, wet, and speechless lay the fair On Kilda's bleak and stormy shore. Oft, oft her breathless lips of clay With frantic cries he fondly prest; And while a senseless corse she lay, He strained her madly to his breast.— But who can paint with pencil true The scene, when sighs first struggling stole (Which thus by magic love he drew) Deep lab'ring from her fluttering soul! “She breathes!—she lives!” the minstrel cried, “Life has not fled this beauteous form!— Protecting heaven, some aid provide!— Shield—shield my trembler from the storm! “No roof its friendly smoke displays!— No storm-scaped faggot, turf, nor tree— No shrub to yield one kindly blaze, And warm my love to life and me! “Dark grows the night!—and cold and sharp Beat wind, and hail, and drenching rain! Nought else remains—I'll burn my Harp!” He cries, and breaks his Harp in twain. “For thee, O Mora! oft it rung, To guard thee from each rival's art; And now, though broken and unstrung, It guards from death thy constant heart.” Bright flamed the fragments as he spoke; One parting sigh his Harp he gave: The storm-drenched faggots blaze through smoke, And snatch his Mora from the grave. PART II. Now heedless raved the stormy night, For instant terror frowned no more, And cheerful blazed the spreading light Round Kilda's dark and dismal shore; And cheerful smiled the grateful pair, And talked of death and dangers past,— When loud the voice of wild despair Came rushing on the midnight blast. Chill horror seized each lover's heart.— “Ah me! what dismal sounds draw near!— Defend us, heaven!” with sudden start Cried Mora, thrilled with frantic fear. One hand supports his trembling wife, The other grasps his trusty glave; “My Harp,” he cries, “has given thee life, And this, that precious life shall save!” “No danger comes,” deep sighed a form, As near the cave it shiv'ring stood; “A stranger, shipwrecked by the storm, Implores the gen'rous and the good; “No danger comes—ah me! forlorn! A wretch by woes and tempests tost!— From love, from friends, and kindred torn, And dashed on Kilda's frightful coast! “Restless with grief, at op'ning day For Lewis' isle I spread the sail; Sweet rose the lark with cheerful lay, And sweetly blew the flatt'ring gale! “Ah fate relentless! thus to cheat With baneful lure and treach'rous smile!— Were human suff'rings not complete Till wrecked on Kilda's desert isle! “Lured by the light that gleams afar, With fainting steps these cliffs I prest:— O! may it prove a polar star, And guide to pity's shelt'ring breast!” Quick from his grasp the falchion flies, As Col each opening arm extends; “Approach, ill fated youth!” he cries, “Here—here are none but suff'ring friends! “Like thee, we hailed the matin song, The flatt'ring gale, and faithless tide!— How sweet! by zephyrs borne along, My Harp and Mora by my side! “Why starts the youth?—approach—draw near. Behold the wreck of storm and wave.— 'Tis all that's left—my Harp so dear I burned, that fair one's life to save!” First pale, then crimson grew his cheek, And sorely shook his manly frame! His fault'ring tongue refused to speak, Save to repeat his Mora's name— A name, which oft had charmed his ear, And e'en from childhood grew more sweet; A name, which love had rendered dear, And sorrow taught him to repeat! Long had he nursed the kindling flame, Long, long possessed her virgin heart; But party feuds and discord came, And forced the tend'rest pair to part. Torn hapless thus from all he loved, The wretched wand'rer left his home; From isle to isle incessant roved;— His only wish—to idly roam! Oft had he braved the tempest's war, Unaided in his slender bark; Oft lonely steered by some faint star, That glimmered through th' involving dark; Oft, oft uncertain whither driven, Or near some rock, or breaker borne; He'd quit his helm to guiding heaven, And sigh his cheerless lot till morn! Oft had the wild heath been his bed, On some lone hill, or craggy steep; While light'nings flashed around his head, And eagles screamed his woes asleep. Thus passed his wand'ring life away, “A wretch by woes and tempests tost,” Till fortune, in her changeful play, Wrecked him on Kilda's fatal coast. Ah! little thought he, while he strove 'Gainst whelming wave and rocky shore, Yon light would guide him to his love, For whom these ceaseless ills he bore! “Why starts the youth!—approach—draw near; Behold the wreck of storm and wave!— 'Tis all that's left!—my Harp so dear I burned, that fair one's life to save!” A glance from Mora's speaking eye Half calmed the fond youth's labouring breast. The tale goes round—the bleak winds sigh, And Col mistrustless sinks to rest. Ah! how could cold distrust possess A breast so gen'rous, kind, and true! A heart still melting to distress, To love—false fair one! and to—you. The morn arose with aspect drear, The waves still dash with sullen roar.— Col starts from rest—no Mora's near, The treach'rous pair are far from shore! From Kilda's cliff that towers on high, He spies the white sail far at sea; And, while the big tear fills each eye, Cries, “Have I burned my Harp for thee!” DONALD AND FLORA, A BALLAD, ON THE DEATH OF A FRIEND KILLED AT THE BATTLE OF SARATOGA. 1778. When many hearts were gay, Careless of aught but play, Poor Flora slipt away Sadd'ning to Mora A retreat so named by the lovers.. Loose flowed her golden hair, Quick heaved her bosom bare, As thus to the troubled air She vented her sorrow: Loud howls the stormy west, Cold, cold is winter's blast:— Haste then, O Donald, haste! Haste to thy Flora! Twice twelve long months are o'er Since on a foreign shore You promised to fight no more, But meet me in Mora. “Where now is Donald dear?” Maids cry with taunting sneer; “Say, is he still sincere To his loved Flora?” Parents upbraid my moan; Each heart is turned to stone;— Ah Flora! thou'rt now alone, Friendless in Mora! Come then, O come away! Donald, no longer stay!— Where can my rover stray From his loved Flora? Ah, sure he ne'er could be False to his vows and me!— Oh heav'ns! is not yonder he Bounding o'er Mora! “Never, O wretched fair,” Sighed the sad messenger, “Never shall Donald mair Meet his loved Flora! Cold as yon mountain snow Donald thy love lies low! He sent me to sooth thy woe, Weeping in Mora. “Well fought our valiant slain On Saratoga's plain; Thrice fled the hostile train From British glory. But ah! though our foes did flee, Sad was each victory. Youth, love, and loyalty, Fell far from Mora! “Here take this love-wrought plaid,” Donald expiring said, “Give it to yon dear maid Drooping in Mora. Tell her, O Allan, tell! Donald thus bravely fell, And that in his last farewell He thought on his Flora. Mute stood the trembling fair, Speechless with wild despair, Then striking her bosom bare, Sighed out “poor Flora! Ah Donald!—ah well-a-day!” Was all the fond heart could say. At length the sound died away Feebly on Mora. TO MRS PLEYDELL. WITH A POT OF HONEY, During the ferment occasioned by the Popish Bill of Toleration, 1779 This bill, so harmless, and indeed so laudable in its principles, occasioned, however, through fanaticism and intolerance, the burning of the Popish chapel in Edinburgh, and the dreadful conflagration in London.. Removed, thank God! from fierce contentions; Unknown to parties or Conventions; Alike averse to rage and folly, And foe to gloomy melancholy; Amid confusion, war, and zeal, Accept these lines from bard Macneill. When morning comes, my breakfast down, Composed and wrapped in flannel gown, Till Andrew The hair-dresser. comes my brains to muddy, I dedicate some hours to study.— Behold me then, in elbow chair, Turn o'er a leaf with serious air; Or seized with strong poetic fit, Compose some precious scrap of wit:— Fired by the muse's melting strain, I rise—sit down—get up again; When 'midst my raptures, frisks, and capers, Bounce! in comes Christy The maid-servant. with—the papers. With some regret I drop the quill.— Well!—what's the news?—the Popish Bill. Is Keppel tried?—a dull essay From fierce I. A. A nonjuring clergyman and a Roman priest. These two gentlemen kept up for some months a daily warfare in the public prints, which, together with advertisements of protestant associations, and pamphlets for and against popery, generally occupied nearly two-thirds of the newspapers. to sly John Hay A nonjuring clergyman and a Roman priest. These two gentlemen kept up for some months a daily warfare in the public prints, which, together with advertisements of protestant associations, and pamphlets for and against popery, generally occupied nearly two-thirds of the newspapers.; Has d'Estaing sailed?—“To show the better What papists are, this day a letter, Just from the press, which well explains What hellish laws that sect maintains!” Where's Byron?—“Murders!—popish tricks; No faith!—no faith with heretics!” Ashamed;—provoked in every page, I curse the papers in a rage; Start up and ring with all my might; —Here!—take this nonsense from my sight! Scarce have I banished raving faction, Till in bolts J?y A keen politician. in distraction. “All—all is lost!—d'Estaing's gone forth! God curse that headstrong blockhead North! No scheme succeeds—we've no invention!— This nation's ruined past redemption! Our fleets are beat!—our trade is gone— We'll be invaded ten to one— Ecod! the French may come to-morrow— It won't cause universal sorrow.— They've many friends in this wise nation— The Popish bill of toleration.”— Stop, Doctor!—stop!—“Why should I stop, pray!” I'm really sick of bill of popery— “The deuce you are!—your reasons?—eh!”— Some other time—some other day. Thus, doubly teased 'twixt saint and sinner, An invitation comes to dinner: To dress I run—thank heaven! I cry, Some pious hearts are often dry; A cheerful glass may work a wonder; May still, perhaps, this papal thunder.— O! grant us, Bacchus, wine that's strong! Raise! Orpheus, raise the blithesome song! Let Pleydell come, serenely gay! And social mirth shall crown the day. Flushed with fond hope, away I haste— (Alas! why must I tell the rest!) In spite of dishes, nice and rare, In spite of wit—for you were there; In spite of ale, punch, port, and sherry; Though S?n sang, we ne'er were merry. Ask you the cause? 'twas indigestion, From one cursed sauce each dish was drest in; For while we ate and drank our fill, Still in our stomachs stuck the—bill. Ere since this feast, or popish revel, I've been a poor tormented devil! Where'er I popt my list'ning head; Whate'er I heard; whate'er I read; From morn to night, from day to day, The constant theme was—Popery. 'Tis now, methinks, five weeks at least, Since first I sought some tranquil feast; Where wholesome food and converse kind Might please the stomach, cheer the mind; Make folks good-humoured, frank, and civil, And banish popery to—the devil! I sought, I say; nay racked my brain, To find this feast, but all in vain; When t'other morn, in 'elbow chair, Untied my shoes, uncombed my hair, Two hours from bed, and breakfast o'er, Rap! went the knocker at the door. Upstarted Christy from the wheel— “Is this the house o'Squire Macneill?” “Yes—what is that?”—“A can, my queen, Just come to Leith frae Aberdeen; The freight's a shilling—carriage twa— The weight I'm sure is far frae sma'— I wonder what the sorrow's in't? It maun be leed, or stane o'flint! The deil be on't! its hurt my heed, It's surely filled wi' stanes or leed!” The chattering rogue received his money, The stones and lead turned out good—Honey; Pure, rich, and sparkling as you see; The product of th' industrious bee: A balmy gift from shrub and flower! The fruits of many a toilsome hour. Struck with the prospect of my treasure, I felt, methought, unusual pleasure: A sudden charm; a joy refined Shed peace and comfort o'er the mind Each sound of Popery died away, And thus I said—or meant to say— In past'ral days, when wants were few, When love beat strong and friendship true, Our fathers, nurtured in content, A calm unruffled lifetime spent Mid herds and flocks (their only care), A feast like this was oft their fare. Here, by the streamlet's bubbling side, Unknown to controversial pride, The oaten pipe and rural lay Chaced spleen and ranc'rous hate away.— Unskilled in schoolmen's mystic dance, Untrained in dark Intolerance, No zealous phrensy fired the breast; No fears fantastic broke their rest; By nature taught, they still pursued What whispering conscience said was good; Nor could their social minds approve Of aught that severed peace and love! Harassed with zeal, and frantic passion, And for the times—quite out of fashion; I can't help sighing for repose, Envying the life our fathers chose. At morn and eve whene'er I spy My warning can with placid eye, In midst of fierce religious splutter, I spread, with smiles, my bread and butter; Draw near my feast of sparkling brown, Lay thick the charm, then—gulp it down; Experience joys serenely still, Nor pass one thought on—Popish Bill. Take then, dear Pleydell! take this treasure, The source of soothing peace and pleasure; When dark and dismal qualms attack you, Or fears of popish priests distract you, Observe the rule I herewith give you, And take my word it will relieve you. When Sol through curtains darts his head, And wakes sweet Aggy Two young ladies, who at the time resided with Mrs Pleydell. still in bed, Or Vesper mild through whispering groves Lures Mary Two young ladies, who at the time resided with Mrs Pleydell. to the haunts she loves; When cups are ranged, and muffins hot, And green or congo in the pot; Instead of popery's dismal gloom, Pour out a dish of rich perfume: Dismiss your fears—be frank—be funny— Produce with smiles your—Can of Honey. Glance o'er these lines ('twill be an honour Conferred upon the happy donor); Excuse whate'er you thing is said ill;— In short, be—just blithe Mrs Pleydell. TO ELIZA ON HER MARRIAGE. You're now, Eliza, fixed for life; In other words, you're now—a wife; And let me whisper in your ear, A wife, though fixed, has cause to fear; For much she risks, and much she loses, If an improper road she chooses. Yet think not that I mean to fright you, My plan, au contraire's to delight you; To draw the lines where comfort reaches; Where folly flies; where prudence teaches. In short, Eliza, to prevent you From nameless ills that may torment you: And ere bright Hymen's torch burns faintly, From nuptial glare conduct you gently, Where (cured of wounds from Cupid's quiver) A milder lustre beams for ever! First, then, Eliza, change your carriage, Courtship's a different thing from marriage; And much I fear (by passion blinded) This change at first is seldom minded. The miss who feasts on rich romances, And love-sick sonnets, wisely fancies That all the end of ardent wooing Is constant billing, constant cooing. The nymph again, whom caution teaches To doubt the truth of rapturous speeches, She whom experience oft has schooled, And shewn how husbands may be—ruled, Laughs at the whims of fond sixteen, And thinks that wedlock stamps—a queen. Now I (though ne'er, alas! contracted) Consider both as half distracted; And will predict that endless strife Must be the lot of either wife. Not that I would infer from hence That men of feeling, worth, or sense, Could ever try to wound or pain A tender breast with cold disdain; Or e'er descend to storm and battle At fondly-foolish female prattle. Yet if fond madam, without reason, Will fret and fume, and utter treason, Plaguing her plain, unpuffing spouse, About his former oaths and vows, And tender sighs, and soft expressions, With various comments and digressions, I will not swear that mere connexion Will guard the husband's warm affection; And when affection cools, they say The husband's apt to—go astray. Maids, praised and flattered all their lives, Expect as much when they are wives; And think, when husbands cease palavering, That love (sweet souls!) is surely wavering: Then hey! for pets, and cold distrust, Doubt's sullen brow, and dreams accurst.— The game goes on, ma'am's in the dumps, And jealousy at last is trumps. For thee, fair flower! of softest dye, That caught so late each vagrant eye, Still breathing sweets, still blooming gay, Beauteous in winter as in May: For thee this truth the muse has penned, The muse—but more thy anxious friend: ‘Woman's bright charms were given to lure us, They catch, 'tis true; but can't secure us.’ Sage Solomon, who paints with beauty A virtuous woman's worth and duty, Compares her to a ship of trade, That brings from far her daily bread She is like the merchant ships, she bringeth her food from afar. Prov. xxxi. v. 14... This may be true; but as for me, I'll draw a plainer simile, And call a virtuous wife a gem, Which for its worth we ne'er contemn, Though soon its water, size, and hue, Grow quite familiar to the view. What then ensues? Why, faith, I'll tell ye; We think of nothing but—the value. Yet take this gem and lay it by From the possessor's careless eye, Conceal its lustre, dazzling bright, From beaming hourly on his sight, I'll take you any bet, at pleasure, Whene'er he views this tempting treasure, With eager bliss and sparkling eyes He'll mark each new-born charm arise, And with the joy of first possession, Admire and rave, sans intermission! If women, therefore, would be wise, Instead of murmurs, tears, and sighs, And sullen moods, and scolding frays, When lovie's absent for some days, Let every female art conspire To drive him from the parlour fire. Of all the plagues in wedded life, To teaze or to torment a wife, There's none more likely to increase The bane of matrimonial peace, Than the tame husband always by With prying and suspicious eye. Mark, then, when ? goes to town, Smile thou, when other wives would frown; He only goes (nay, don't be angry) To take a walk to make him hungry; To taste awhile, unknown to care, A change of exercise and air; Observe the pert, the bold, the witty— How diff'rent from his own sweet Betty! Return impatient to his home, No husband, but a fond bridegroom. Lastly, Eliza, let me say, That wives should rather yield than sway; To thwart a husband's fixed opinion Is not the way to gain dominion, For kisses order, tears reprove Leurs ordres sont des caresses, leurs menaces sont des pleurs. Rousseau., And teach us reverence, fear, and love!— O! born to sooth and guide the heart With native softness, void of art! Thou, whom nor pride nor fashion sways, Unchanged by flattery's giddy praise; And thou, to whom a trem'lous youth First spoke the tale of love and truth, Blending with passion's fond alarms The bright'ning beam of virtue's charms— Ah! lend not now a careless ear!— Yet, yet attend to truth sincere! These lines at least with smiles receive, The last, perhaps, thy bard shall give. While pleasure spreads her gawdy train, To lure the trifling and the vain; While fashion kills the tedious day With shopping, concert, cards, and play; While female love and youth's fair charms Shrink from pure passion's ardent arms, And cling to splendour's fancied bliss, With withering age and wretchedness, Be thine, Eliza, more refined, The pleasures of the virtuous mind! Be thine the transports of the heart, Which love and goodness still impart; The tender glance, the tranquil smile, A husband's sorrows to beguile; The blush of joy, divinely meek, That paints a mother's glowing cheek; The balm that friendship still bestows; The tear that drops for human woes!— These, these, Eliza! light the way, And cheer when other charms decay; Conduct through care and worldly gloom, And whisper joys—beyond the tomb. TO MIRA, WITH A BOTTLE OF IRISH USQUEBAUGH. Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus. In spite of all that poets tell us, (For poets are but lying fellows) Of Cupid's flames, and Cupid's darts, And all his soft bewitching arts, That teach the stubborn heart to move, And tune the rudest speech to love, I cannot say (with all respect For powerful Love) I recollect One single instance—on my honour! Where prudence, with love's pangs upon her, Or sprightly humour, wit, or sense, Far less the flow of eloquence, Adorned the swain, whose heart and liver Throbbed with the darts from Cupid's quiver. For me (should love-sick qualms attack us), I've much more faith in honest Bacchus, And can't help thinking master Cupid Oft makes us mad; but oftner stupid: At least, if one may judge from action, And looks that border on distraction, The man who really feels love's passion, Acts, speaks, and reasons—out of fashion. ‘This may be true,’ I hear you cry, ‘Yet bards, you say, can sometimes lie; And since you choose the present time To vent 'gainst love your spleen, in rhime, Produce some proofs, or cease to rail.’— With all my heart!—I'll tell a tale. When sprightly Daphne went a maying, And all the loves and graces playing Around her beauteous face were seen To deck the bloom of fair nineteen, Young Strephon met her on the green. Struck with her charms—to speak afraid, By love enthralled, by love dismayed— The senseless Strephon (keep from laughter!) Had not the power to follow after; But gazed, and gaped, with transports swelling, Nor asked her name, nor marked her dwelling. Six months, six torturing months and more, Did Strephon loud his loss deplore; And often rang'd the fields, in vain, To find the lovely maid again; And often cursed his fluttering folly, And often groaned with melancholy; When Love and Fun one night agree, The youthful pair should meet at—tea. Soon as our love-struck swain had entered The dazzling spot where beauties centred, And caught his Daphne's well known charms, He lost the power of legs and arms. That foot, which Downie A dancing master. taught with pride, Graceful to bow, smoothly to slide, Now aukward strikes his falling cane, Which, trying to obtain again, His luckless skull salutes a chair;— The ladies scream—the ladies stare! Abashed—confused, he drops his hat, Then broiling on his chair he sat. Behold now Strephon in his place, With ‘blushing honours’ on his face; The tea's to hand;—he cannot fail To tread on harmless Tabby's tail: To ease her pain, puss squalls and kicks, And in his leg her talons sticks; And tears the hose, and eke the skin, Till streams run down poor Strephon's shin: Stung with his smart, I do assure ye, He roared and capered like a fury; And in his gambols (dire mishap!) Dropt cup and tea in Daphne's lap. You loath the sot with liquor muddy, Eyes all inflamed, and face all ruddy; Yet never once conclude with me That Strephon was as drunk as he; The man who speaks things out of season, Or acts as if bereft of reason, I must consider just as bad As he who's drunk, or he who's mad. ‘Pray, sir, a truce with moralizing, And answer this without disguising: Did Strephon e'er his flame discover?’ No—never while a true-true lover. In vain each night he frames with art Some speech to melt his Daphne's heart; Whene'er he tries to ope his lips, Away! each soft idea skips, And leaves him nought but hems and haws, And stammerings to fill up each pause; And blushes, groans, and palpitation— (A pretty kind of conversation!) ‘Was nothing then devised to win her?’ Nothing, till one blest day at dinner.— ‘At dinner, say you—how—when—where?’— How keenly curious women are! I would be brief—I hate great talkers— You're so particular!—well!—at Walker's A noted tavern in Edinburgh.. One morning, Strephon's asked to dine, To meet at four, to part at nine: The party choice!—for reasons shown him He went, and drank his magnum bonum A bottle of claret, containing two English quarts.. Behold him now, a jovial boy! No fluttering fears!—no trembling joy! And, all his groans and blushes over, He tries once more to play the lover. Struck with amaze, sweet Daphne hears New accents reach her ravished ears: ‘And, fairest of thy sex!’ he cries, (While passion sparkles in his eyes) ‘O source of every chaste delight! My thought by day; my dream by night; My every hope; my every care; My joy; my comfort; my—despair: Ah! wherefore should I still conceal ‘What all can feign, but few can feel Cartwright.!’ Since first these heavenly charms were seen By luckless Strephon on the green; Since first with smiles and spirits gay You hailed the merry morn of May, What fluttering hopes have fired my brain! What fears of torture, doubts of pain! What pangs, what sorrows, ne'er to find By speech, or look, my Daphne kind, But cold and senseless to my anguish, Still left a wretch to droop and languish!’ ‘My God!’ the wondering fair replies (While tears of rapture fill her eyes), ‘How, how could Daphne ever know Her Strephon's love; her Strephon's woe! Till this soft tale, so sweetly sung! I never heard your tuneful tongue; Till this fond hour, I never found These eyes but downcast on the ground;— You still were silent, absent, cool:— I took you, Strephon, for—a fool.’ Now, Mira, that my tale is ended, I hope I've proved what I intended, Namely, that, without generous wine, A youth may sigh, and groan, and whine, But never talk in strains divine. For what is love, or what is beauty, If lovers' tongues can't do their duty? Or what are flames, or inclination, Without the fire of inspiration?— All, all must end in strange confusion, Without the gift of elocution. For me, who never had much brass, I find vast courage in a glass; And now that blushing's out of fashion, Or drink I must, or breathe no passion. And sure, if strains like mine have charmed one When half-seas o'er, there's no great harm done. And yet last night, when first we met, You frowned and fretted in a pet, Withdrew your hand, with face averted, And thrice for me your chair deserted; But, warmed by wine, I well remember, Unchilled by looks, cold as December, I prattled wit from jovial quaffing, Till quite o'ercome, at length, with laughing, You pardon sealed; and, generous-hearted, Gave me your hand before we parted; Nay, once delighted, almost swore I ne'er talked half so well before. Charmed with the good effects of wine, I next day hurried to Gavine A famous distiller of liqueurs, near Edinburgh., And straightway bought (ne merveille pas!) A bottle of his Usquebaugh. Which now I send you, with this rule, That when I'm silent, like a fool, Or stupid grow, or lose my temper, For God's sake! fill me up a bumper! Till head, and heart, and tongue improve, And make me say whate'er you love! O could its virtues but inspire This breast with true poetic fire, To sing, in numbers strong and clear, Thy friendship, ardent, and sincere; Thy humour, sprightly, social, free, Thy temper's blest serenity! O! could its virtues but impart The language of thy feeling heart, To paint in accents sweetly mild The duties of a tender child! And every art and virtue rare That sooths an aged father's care; In faith! dear Mira, to be plain, (Though much I dread your cold disdain) In spite of all you'd think or say, I'd drink till tipsy every day. THE WEE THING; OR, MARY OF CASTLE-CARY. A BALLAD. ‘Saw ye my wee thing? Saw ye mine ain thing? Saw ye my true love down on yon lea? Crossed she the meadow yestreen at the gloaming? Sought she the burnie whar flowers the haw tree? Her hair it is lint-white; her skin it is milk-white; Dark is the blue o'her saft rolling ee; Red, red her ripe lips! And sweeter than roses: Whar could my wee thing wander frae me?’ ‘I saw nae your wee thing, I saw nae your ain thing, Nor saw I your true love down by yon lea; But I met my bonny thing late in the gloaming, Down by the burnie whar flowers the haw tree. ‘Her hair it was lint-white; her skin it was milk-white; Dark was the blue o'her saft rolling ee; Red ware her ripe lips, and sweeter than roses:— Sweet ware the kisses that she gae to me!’ ‘It was nae my wee thing, it was nae my ain thing, It was nae my true love ye met by the tree: Proud is her leel heart! modest her nature! She never looed ony, till ance she looed me. ‘Her name it is Mary; she's frae Castle-Cary: Aft has she sat, when a bairn, on my knee:— Fair as your face is, war't fifty times fairer, Young bragger, she ne'er would gie kisses to thee!’ ‘It was then your Mary; she's frae Castle-Cary; It was then your true love I met by the tree; Proud as her heart is, and modest her nature, Sweet ware the kisses that she gae to me.’ Sair gloomed his dark brow, blood-red his cheek grew, Wild flashed the fire frae his red rolling ee!— ‘Ye's rue sair this morning, your boasts and your scorning: Defend ye, fause traitor! fu' loudly ye lie.’ ‘Awa wi' beguiling,’ cried the youth, smiling.— Aff went the bonnet; the lint-white locks flee; The belted plaid fa'ing, her white bosom shawing, Fair stood the loved maid wi' the dark rolling ee! ‘Is it my wee thing! is it mine ain thing! Is it my true love here that I see!’ ‘O Jamie, forgie me; your heart's constant to me; I'll never mair wander, dear laddie, frae thee!’ THE WHIP, OR, A TOUCH AT THE TIMES. SENT TO MISS D. OF LINSTED, WITH A WHIP MADE OF A RHINOCEROS'S SKIN. 1784. Quæ fuerant vitia mores sunt. Seneca. Ere modest virtue lost her way Among the dissolute and gay, Few modes were used for travel; Unknown to whip, or spur, or boot, Each hardy Briton trudged on foot, Through mud, bog, dust, and gravel. 'Twas then the fair, as story tells, (Ah! how unlike our modern belles!) Knew neither coach nor saddle; No female Phaetonians then Surpassed the boldest of our men In gesture, look, and straddle. But formed by nature's artless hand, Blushes, 'tis said, at her command, Oft stole o'er beauty's features: No wife then scorned domestic sweets; No daughter Jehu! scoured the streets; Good lord! what simple creatures! Emerged at length from gothic rules, Our fair ones, trained in happier schools, For blushes, now give fashion; Each modest virtue thrown aside, Behold! like men, erect, astride! They drive!—they whip!—they dash on! O! may the glorious day arrive, When each bold lass her nag shall drive O'er hedges, gates, and ditches! Despise the housewife's hateful lot, And change the useless petticoat For boots and buckskin breeches! Yet heterogeneous as they are, Half man—half woman—half centaur, Some grave folks dread infection: See! virtue, trembling, flies the land! Alas! 'gainst furious four in hand, No common whip's protection! Struck with the thought, I reasoned long,— ‘Eliza, poor thing's, far from strong, And yet she loves a canter; Some fierce virago, high in blood, May lay her sprawling in the mud, Or in a hedge-row plant her! ‘What then remains the weak to shield? Must freedom thus her charter yield?— Has beauty no defender? —Alas! no bosom swells with rage!— There's nought in this bold dashing age, But flogging to befriend her! ‘Since lashing's then the ton, the tip, And victory now turns on the Whip, The toughest whip should win; And as we know in each hard bout, The ‘toughest hide holds longest out,‘ I'll find—a whip of skin.’ Pleased with the fancy, swift I sped, Mad with the project in my head, I ranged half India o'er; But hides well beat, are seldom tough: At last a bit of precious stuff I found on Afric's shore. There, by his streams and tangling groves, The huge Rhinoceros careless roves, Though growls each savage nigh: Undaunted, armed with horn and hide, To ball and dart he turns his side, Unheeded as they fly. But what's the armed, the bold, the strong! (Again we moralize our song,) If treachery aims the blow! Ev'n Samson fell by female wit, And see! in subtle treachery's pit The mighty beast lies low. Thus fall'n by cunning's sneaking plot, With joy they strip his horny coat; ('Twas wond'rous to behold!) ‘By heavens!’ I cried, ‘at length I've found A skin that's proof 'gainst mortal wound! 'Tis worth its weight in gold!’ Torn from the side it lately graced, A slice I cut with eager haste; A tough, tenacious slip! And, hurrying home to British land, Gave it to Kelly, in the Strand Whip-maker to the Prince of Wales., Who formed it to a WHIP. Thus armed, with virtue on your side, Unconquered reign, undaunted ride, Nor fear e'en Lade Sir John Lade and Lady Archer, two of the most celebrated phaeton drivers in England. or Archer Sir John Lade and Lady Archer, two of the most celebrated phaeton drivers in England.. Some dame indeed may whoop and crack, But let Rhinoceros touch her back, It will both blue and starch her. O, could its virtues but repair The lungs of thy half-winded mare, How great would be thy glory! From Linsted town thy fame would trot, E'en to the house of Johnny Grot, In many a marv'lous story. Then should we hear in clam'rous boast, How one young fair one ruled the roast, As Pitt now rules the nation; Made female jockies bounce and skip, And by the power of one famed Whip, Flogged vice from freedom's station! But since, alas! no cure we know, Since Phill Eliza's mare. must puff, or you move slow, Mark well a friend's direction: Hold fast the reins of female pride, Whip ev'ry coxcomb from your side, To listen is—infection. Yet should the man of worth possest, Fair candour glowing at his breast, Confess thy pow'r of charms; List to his tale, be frank, be kind, Unfashioned blush to love refined, And whip—into his arms! TO MISS JEAN AND MISS ISABELLA MONRO, WITH TWO BOTTLES OF THE OTTA OF ROSES. Tost rudely round this whirling sphere, Estranged from all he valued dear; Shut out from beauty's bright'ning ray; The social night, the tranquil day; Involved in tumult's wild uproar, And dropt on India's burning shore; Behold a woe-worn wand'rer roam, Far from his friends and native home! ‘Thus 'scaped from storm and battle's rage Alluding to the last naval engagement between Sir Edward Hughes and M. Suffrein in the East Indies, during which the Author was on board his Majesty's ship the Gibraltar., Shall I,’ he cried, ‘new ills engage! Shall I, by wayward fortune crossed, Droop sorrowing on a foreign coast; And whelmed at last in hopeless gloom, Sink unlamented to the tomb!’ ‘Perish the thought!’ a seraph cries, (A seraph wafted from the skies See the Author's Address to the Scottish Muse..) ‘Perish the thought! a softer ray Yet comes to guide thy wildered way. What though rude mirth and tempest's roar, And fortune frowning locks her store; What though no converse reigns refined, And loved Miranda's left behind; A brighter morn will yet appear To chace the gloom and gild the year; A milder dawn o'erspread the grove, A warmer theme attune to love; When freedom's sun bright o'er the main Illumes fair Albion's cliffs again; And glittering high on mountain hoar, Proclaims afar loved Scotia's shore; Where friendship waits in smiles arrayed, To bind the wounds that fate has made; And sympathy, with melting eye, To catch the tale, and heave the sigh; And mild oblivion, kind to cast Her dark'ning shade o'er suff'rings past. ‘Meanwhile,’ she said, ‘this gift receive, And henceforth, wand'rer, cease to grieve; For know, in this a virtue rare, (A passport likewise to the fair.) Can cheer dejection's languid gloom, And rich, to beauty yield perfume! Guard then this treasure, and when fate Conducts thee safe, or soon, or late, Where Forth's meanderings gently glide Through fields that wave their cultured pride, There, while again thou wander'st o'er Each dear loved spot, oft trod before; Or from Strevlina's height serene Survey'st around the pictured scene; Or view'st sublime her castled towers From A?'s sheltering bowers; Where social mirth wan care beguiles, 'Midst female virtues, female smiles; While hope's fond joys past sorrows heal, Let breasts like thine fresh ardour feel, To mark each virtue as it springs, And as the muse impassioned sings, On maids of worth this gift bestow, A?; a?; a Monro.’ Charmed with this tale, with sighs I prest The welcome treasure to my breast; ‘Here dwell,’ I cried, ‘till fate once more Conducts me safe to Scotia's shore! Till free from tumult's madd'ning strife, Once more I taste a poet's life; And female smiles to soothe and cheer, And love to cheat the lingering year: Here rest,’ I cried, ‘till heaven bestows Your ?'s, your ?'s, your Monro's!’ The seraph smiled, and instant flew! The canvas spread, Eolus blew! From India's shores and burning skies, O'er waves the Gibraltar flies. Blow, blow, ye breezes! oft I said, While seas the ling'ring voyage delayed; Blow, blow, ye breezes! oft I cried, While sleep her balmy rest denied: Yet, midst my watchings, cares, and rest, Still clasped the treasure to my breast! Relieved from cares that lately spread A tempest round a wand'rer's head, Arrived at length, where tumults cease, And all within is hope and peace, The warning seraph whispers low, ‘Remember Worth, and each Monro!’ Go! partner of my throbbing heart! To gentler breasts thy balm impart! Go!—to yon social bowers repair, Far softer forms thy sweets shall share! Go! and while odours from thee break Round Jane or Bella's snowy neck, Tell them from me, no sweets refined Can match the tender female mind; Nor Persia's rose The otta is made from the roses of Persia., that blooms so fair, With virtue's charms can e'er compare; No! nor rich Ceylon's spicy gales, Nor famed Arabia's scented vales, A balm so grateful can diffuse, To wake and animate the muse, As that which shook from friendship's wing, Attunes the lyre's according string, And prompts e'en bards like me to sing! GRANDEUR: AN ODE. Sæpius ventis agitatur ingens Pinus; et celsæ graviore casu Decidunt turres, feriuntque summos Fulmina montes. Hor. How varied lies the chequered scene!— Dunmait capt with snow; While humbler smiles, in vernal green, The sun-clad vale below: Gay spring her cheering task performs, Regardless of the wintry storms That sweep proud Ochil's lofty side; And, sheltered from the mountain gale, Secure, smooth glides the winding sail Down Forth's meandering tide. Alas! how like the chequered state Of man's contrasted lot! The storms that whirl round Grandeur's gate; The peasant's sheltered cot; Disdainful pride, with wintry brow; Rough labour, jocund at his plough, Still cheered by health's unclouded beam; While, safe from luxury's whelming tide, Peace, hope, and resignation, glide Down life's untroubled stream. To meditation's musing mind Still moral pictures rise: Ambition, dashed by fortune's wind, When tow'ring to the skies; Exalted beauty, doomed to move In climes unwarmed by genial love, Tost by the storms of sordid strife!— While nurtured in some vale obscure, The humbler fair one blooms secure The mistress and the wife! But late, in strength and beauty's prime, The tow'ring Plane arose; Proud, o'er Strevlina's height sublime It waved its mantling boughs! What time mild evening gilds her star, The trav'ller spied it from afar, And, raptured, wondered where it grew;— Fond fancy placed its magic height Mid regions streaked with golden light Through Heaven's ethereal blue!— Embosomed in the bank below, That courts the southern breeze, The humbler Hawthorn's doomed to blow Mid kindred shrubs and trees! Obscure, its balmy sweets diffuse, Unmarked, save by the moral muse, That nightly breathes the rich perfume!— Ah! what is Grandeur's splendid show!— Ambition, mark!—the Plane laid low The cutting down of this beautiful tree (a circumstance that gave general dissatisfaction) occasioned the present ode.! The Hawthorn left to bloom. MAY-DAY; OR, THE DISCOVERY. A PASTORAL. IN THE MANNER OF CUNNINGHAM. See! rob'd in new beauties, young May cheers the lawn! Ye virgins! how charming her air! Haste! cull her fresh flow'rets dew-dropping at dawn, And chaplets entwine for your hair! Yes! weave the gay garland! each moment improve! Youth's pleasures, like Spring, fleet away! Life has its soft season—that season is Love. —Ah! taste its fond joys while 'tis May. But lately I winded yon mountain's green side;— How blessed! for a fair one was by; I marked, as she welcomed the Spring's opening pride, The rapture that beamed in her eye: Her fav'rite young lambkins ran bleating around, (Their fleeces were whiter than snow!) The cliffs, crowned with oakwood, returned the soft sound; The still lake gleamed placid below. ‘How happy,’ she cried, ‘in some sheltered retreat, With lambkins and flocks bleating nigh; In my straw-covered cottage, though humble, yet neat, I could live—and contented would die! This oak-waving mountain would ward winter's blast; Yon lake teach complaint to be still; Health, mirth, peace, and temperance, crown the repast, And freedom—bound light o'er the hill!’ A glance that escaped the dear maid at the time, Half whispered a wish was untold;— ‘And would my fair shepherdess deem it a crime If Edwin were guard to the fold?’ ‘I told my soft wishes Cunningham's Content.,’ she sweetly replied, (Ye virgins! her voice was divine!) ‘I've rich ones rejected, and great ones denied, But take me, fond shepherd!—I'm thine.’ Her look was so artless! her accent so mild! Her candour so sweetly expressed! I gazed on her beauties as blushing she smiled, And clasped the loved maid to my breast! The primrose in clusters breathed fragrance around, And witnessed the vows that were given; The lark, that sat listening, soar'd swift from the ground, And warbled the contract in—heaven! Yon cottage, where woodbines so fondly entwine, We've chose for our humble retreat, Where Teath's soften'd murmurs raise musings divine, 'Tis there my love's lambkins shall bleat! There friendship shall lure modest worth to our door, And shelter from care's wintry blast; Content, decked in smiles, spread her pastoral store, And my fairest prepare the repast!— Thus fixed, what imports it, ye great ones and vain, Though splendour withholds her false gleam, If pleased with our little, and strangers to pain, Life glides placid by like yon stream? While Health, heavenly goddess! smiles buxom and gay, Shall we murmur that wealth comes not nigh? When thy charms, Independence! thus prompt the free lay, And the muse, lark-like, soars to the sky! AN ELEGY On the sudden death of a beautiful young boy, in Jamaica, attended by the singular occurrence of a nightingale perching on the tree under which he was interred, and singing sweetly during the funeral service. WRITTEN IN JAMAICA IN 1788. Relentless Death!—ah! why so soon Cut down the flow'ret fair to view! Pale gleamed the light of yonder moon, When pest'lence shed her deadly dew He died of a putrid sore throat, occasioned by unwholesome night damps.! The morn arose serene and clear, The sun refulgent glowed at noon; But nought the drooping flower could cheer.— Ah! wherefore drooped the flower so soon! By yonder tree (his fav'rite shade, Where late he joyed with sports and play) They dig his grave; there, lowly laid, Sleep's Campbell's silent senseless clay! Ah! what avails the tear and sigh That close, loved boy! thy funeral gloom! The doleful dirge, and frantic cry Of Afric's mourners round thy tomb In Jamaica it is customary, on the death of a white person, for all the domestic negroes to attend the funeral. If the deceased has been a particular favourite, it is usual for the female slaves to raise, after the interment, a funeral song or dirge, over the grave. This consists of loud and dismal lamentations, chiefly expressive of the good qualities of the deceased; such as, ‘O my good massa!’ ‘O my dear massa!’ accompanied with clapping of hands, and violent gesticulations of sorrow.! Ah! what avails!—But cease the strain; Ye weeping parents, dry the tear. See! Philomela joins the train, And chants a requiem o'er his bier. Sweetly she warbles, perched on high, Far from her mate, and haunts of even; She comes, an herald from the sky, To greet the cherub soul to heaven! Yet here, should pensive pilgrim stray At soft'ning eve, or fervent noon, Here may he heave the sigh, and say, ‘Ah, wherefore droop'd the flower so soon!’ EPITAPH. SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JAMES GRAHAM, ESQ. LATE OF THE PARISH OF WESTMORELAND, JAMAICA. IN TESTIMONY OF AFFECTION, AND AS A TRIBUTE TO THE VIRTUES OF THE BEST OF MEN, AND THE KINDEST OF BROTHERS, THIS MAUSOLEUM IS ERECTED BY JOHN GRAHAM, OF THREE-MILE RIVER, JAMAICA. ANNO. 1798. Accept, loved shade! of him whose breathless clay No sigh returns to aught that grief can say; Accept, loved shade! this monument of woe; The last sad gift thy friend can now bestow!— For him, alas! 'tis left to raise the tomb; Steal from the crowd, and court sepulchral gloom; Clasp to his heart thy cold untimely urn This amiable, honourable, and accomplished man, was unfortunately killed in the mistaken defence of a character which no calumny could have injured; and by a ruffian whose slander no man of worth ought to have regarded., And weep thy virtues—never to return! Nor can the muse (that muse thou lov'dst to hear) Repress the sigh, or check the starting tear; From Britain's shore;—across the Atlantic wave, She comes, to vent her sorrows at thy grave; With trembling hand inscribe thy funeral stone, And with a brother's woes record her own. ON THE DEATH OF LIEUT. GEN. SIR RALPH ABERCROMBY, Killed at the Battle of Alexandria, in Egypt, 21st March, 1801. From carnaged fields bedrenched with gore, How long must Pity shrink with pain; Turn, shuddering pale, from shore to shore, And weep her patriot heroes slain! Touched at her tears that streaming flow, (Just tribute to the good and brave) Britannia, wrapt in sable woe, Bends o'er her Abercromby's grave. ‘And could not age,’ she sorrowing cries, ‘From blood protect thy final doom! Gild thy last eve with milder skies, And lay thee gently in the tomb?’ Rocked in the cradle of alarms, Nursed in the school where glory's won, Rejoicing in the din of arms, Soon Valour hailed her darling son: Foresaw the bright, the guiding beam That led to honour's splendid goal; Saw, flashed round Pompey's Pillar, gleam The parting light'nings of his soul! Yet, in the warrior's dauntless breast, Fond hope with mellowing pencil drew; Pourtrayed the scene, when laurel'd rest, In peace, enjoys the fav'rite few! Vain dream!—with war's indignant frown Fame twined the cypress with the bay;— ‘Be this,’ she cried, ‘the laurel crown To deck my hero's parting day! Sunk in the shade of still repose, Unhonoured drop the valiant, dead;— Bright as his day shall beam the close— He dies in glory's patriot bed!’ ‘He lives!’ Britannia warm replies, As high the trophied urn she rears; ‘He lives in Virtue's bursting sighs, His Country's praise!—his Country's tears!’ ON THE DEATH OF DR DAVID DOIG, MASTER OF THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL, STIRLING. In furnishing materials for the last edition, the Author incautiously gave some lines, hastily composed for insertion in the Edinburgh Newspapers, on the death of his venerable friend Dr Doig. A wish to rectify this mistake, and at the same time to leave some memorial of so good a man, and so eminent a scholar, induced him to substitute, what he flatters himself will be found, at least, less exceptionable in composition, and more characteristic of the person commemorated. The shades of dim twilight descend on the plain; The pale moon gleams faint on the grave; The voice of affliction tunes friendship's sad strain, Re-echoed thus back from the cave.— ‘Vain mortals! whom Learning and Genius elate; Enthusiasts! who pant for a name! Yon village bell, tolled by the mandate of fate, Proclaims—what avails lettered fame! He's gone! to whom learning (though humble his lot) Fond, smiling, unlocked all her store; Called genius to brighten the ardour of thought, And light paths untrodden before This ingenious and profound scholar, during a long and laborious life, dedicated the spare hours of professional duties to the study of ancient philology, history, and metaphysics, which, from the uncommon extent of his talents and erudition, have derived considerable elucidation. For the sake of the learned world, it were much to be wished, that these curious and valuable MSS. now in the possession of his relatives, were secured from accident, and presented to the public.—The London booksellers would find their account in it.. He's gone! round whose temples the muses of Rome Entwined their loved garlands of old; He's gone! to whose mem'ry, inscribed on his tomb, They warbled the truths which he told Alluding to the elegant Latin Epitaph, hereto subjoined.. Alas! ye fond muses! where now dwell your strain! To these haunts will ye never return?— Mute! save when Remembrance, with all her dark train, And Friendship thus wail o'er the urn! Yet, yet shall the strain (if such strains shall survive The sunshine of life's fleeting ray) Record what, if drooping, perchance may revive The minstrel of some future day; Yet, yet shall the strain, if such strains can afford A solace to soothe virtue's moan; Transmit, what indignant, the muse shall record For meek, modest Virtue alone! Shall tell lowly fortune, and bards yet unborn, How Genius bloomed rich in the shade; Unsun'd, flower'd neglected, through thicket and thorn, And wafted her sweets round the glade: Uncheered, unrewarded, by fortune or fame, Fourscore smiling springs hailed the bloom;— Nipt at length, cold neglect felt remorse, tinged with shame, And sculptured the cause on the tomb As a testimony of Dr Doig's literary talents, and as a mark of attention to the dead, the Magistrates of Stirling directed that his own Epitaph, written in Latin verse, should be inscribed on his tombstone. The Epitaph, as originally composed by Dr Doig, comprehends the eight last lines that follow. MORTALES HIC POSITÆ SUNT EXUVIÆ DAVIDIS DOIG, LL.D. SS.R. et A.S. EDIN.

PROLOGUE: Written at the request of the Managers of the Public Kitchen at Edinburgh, for the Benefit of the Poor, 1801. When discord first, with hate infuriate, hurled Their baneful influence o'er a suff'ring world; Broke the firm bands of kindred joys asunder, And left in want the wretch to weep, and—wonder; Thrilled with despair;—unfriended, and oppressed, With hagard eye, pale Poverty, distressed, Roamed the lone wild, a wretched life to save, And, shivering, sunk in famine's darkening cave!— There, sad, she pined, and wailed her hopeles moan, Earth her damp pillow! and her bed—cold stone! Till Charity (from Heaven's fair lineage sprung, Nymph of the melting heart and soothing tongue) Swift from yon starry vault's ethereal blue, To want's dark cell with pitying ardour flew! Cheered with celestial rays that chased the gloom, The fainting mourner waked—as from the tomb; Saw the sweet harbinger of joy again Steal on soft tip-toe to the bed of pain; O'er the cold breast her mantling vestments spread; Wipe the damp brow, and raise the drooping head; Pour the rich cordial, trickling to the heart; Brace the lax fibre, and new strength impart; Kindle fond hope; and, beck'ning with a smile, Lure, while she flew to Britain's fostering isle! To Britain's isle! where, cherished by her care, The poor, if virtuous, never know despair: Warmed by her beams, each bosom learns to glow, And throb, and feel—the sympathy of woe! From ocean's gen'rous sons (in fame enrolled) To Scotia's mountains, and her patriots bold;— Alike her magic power o'er land and wave: —The flame of pity ever warms the brave! Oh! could its light but harmonize the breast, And guide again the jarring world to rest! Spread with mild radiance far from shore to shore, Till friendship binds, and discord's heard no more! Till candour starts at reason's temperate call, And mercy wafts humanity—to all! This night, where Charity's celestial flame Gilds with mild lustre Scotia's annalled fame; Beams in each conscious eye, and, heavenly meek, Glows in soft blushes on each fair one's cheek; This night! indeed, would mock the flowers of rhime, And stamp an era for recording time! Enough for us, who claim no higher care Than aid the wretched, and repel despair; To light the lamp in Poverty's dark cell, And lend new strength to those who—struggle well; —Enough for us! expiring worth to save, And cheer the path of virtue to the grave! JACK AND NANCY, A SEA SONG. Air—Bonny Lass, will you lie in a Barrack. O! say, lovely Nan! can you lie in a hammock? When the mountain-waves rage, can you swing in a hammock? As the winds roar aloft, and rude billows dash o'er us, Can my Nancy sleep soundly amid the wild chorus? O yes! my dear Jack! I can lie in a hammock, When the mountain-waves rage, can sleep sound in a hammock: Rude billows will rock me, when love smiles to cheer me, If thy slumber's sweet, Jack, no dangers can fear me! But say, if, at night, the sad cry comes for wearing; The breakers a-head, and the boatswain loud swearing; When the main-yard dips deep, and white billows break o'er us; Will my Nancy not shrink then amid the dread chorus? O no! my loved lad! when such dangers are near me, My Jack's kindly whispers will sooth me—will cheer me, A kiss snatched in secret, amid the dread horror, Will hush the rude chorus, and still every terror. But say, my sweet Nan! when the tempest's all smashing! The top-sails all split, and the top-masts down crashing! When all hands spring aloft, and no lover to cheer her, Will my Nancy not shrink when such dangers are near her? Ah no! my loved Jack! while the tempest's loud bawling, The top-sails all split, and the top-masts down falling, In watching your dangers, my own will pass over!— In prayers for your safety no fears I'll discover! But O! my loved Nan! when the ship is done clearing, The matches all lighted; the French foe fast nearing, Can you stand to your gun, while pale death drops around you? —'Tis then! my sweet Nancy! new fears will confound you! No! No! my dear Jack! to these fears love's a stranger! When you fight by my side, I'll defy every danger; On your fate my fond eye will be fixed while you're near me; If you fall! Nancy dies!—if you live, love will cheer me! Come! come then, sweet lass! let us swing in a hammock! While the mountain-seas dash round, sleep sound in a hammock! With love such as thine, who would dread war or weather?— While we live, we shall love; when we fall—fall together! This verse (in singing) to be repeated by both at the same time, with the slight alteration of substituting lad for lass by the female singer. THE PLEASURES OF AMBITION: OR, UNE REVERIE A LA CORSE, 1804. ON AN IMPERIAL CORONATION. Hæret lateri lethalis arundo. Virg. The four winds roar round Europe's shore, Deep growled the threat'ning thunder! As from the mud, besmeared with blood, Up towered a thing of wonder!— Its head was black, its face was chalk, Each eye, though sunk, was gleaming; Its sleepless brain, with racking pain, Knew neither rest nor dreaming! In its right hand it waved a brand Of scorching brimstone blazing! The dismal glare made myriads stare, But all were sad, while gazing! Its left hand prest (by way of rest) On scattered crowns and sceptres; Close at its back, in horrid clack, Grinned fiends, or guilt's inspectors. ‘Avaunt!’ it cried, ‘ye sons of pride! Ye grumblers! dread displeasure! My height, ye see—crouch!—bend the knee! Nor dare that height to measure! Kings,—kiss the rod!—I move a god! A god of self-creation: Should one rebel, by heaven and hell! I'll send him to damnation: If one but speaks, in death he squeaks! 'Tis meet you all were civil! If one complains, bound fast in chains, I'll send him to the devil.— What!—doubt my power!—behold the tower Of human height and splendour! Popes, late our foe, now kiss my toe, And tremble at my grandeur.— Shall then my sway not clear the way For unprescribed possession? Shall not my nod secure the road To plunder and oppression? Shall reptiles dare, enleagued, to war And meditate correction; Or dream to curb what may disturb Their safety or protection? A pigmy state, with gold elate, Pretends to check dominion! A Russian bear attempts in air To soar on eagle pinion! A Swedish owl presumes to growl, And form a northern faction! A Turkish mute dares to dispute My title and subjection!— But soon I'll crush Turk, Swede, and Rush, With all their schemes nefarious! As for John Bull—when reason's cool, I think each plan precarious. Yet John loves beef; his dread and grief Is want of constant stuffing; Should famine come, Defection's hum Would soon drown naval puffing!— Oh! for the day, when want's dismay Would damp this purse-proud nation! Then should kind gales, with flowing sails, Waft us to rich sensations!— My sallad boys would taste new joys! Each raptured sound would tell us, That what half-feasts these grumbling beasts, Would stuff my poor starved fellows!— Curse on the spot, where hardy Scot Through perils scorns dejection! Each home-loved rill, and heath-crowned hill, Bind fast his warm affection:— Nor famine's gloom, nor war's death-doom, Can damp his dauntless valour: A vet'ran Scot Abercromby. spoiled Egypt's plot! Ah! pangs!—that was a nailer! What's at my back!—ye hell-hound pack, Avaunt! and cease tormenting!— I know it all!—ye can't appal! I see black storms fermenting; And though I fear yon Russian bear May yet breed some disaster, And oft times think this northern link Will prove a blistering plaster,— Yet, while I eye deep Prussia sly, And cautious watch Batavi, Prepared for blows, I'll make these foes Ere long, cry out—peccavi.— Expences flow!—my treasury's low! (No plunder makes me richer!) I dread a drain!—no longer Spain! Ah! morbleu!—there's a twitcher!— But up! proud heart—why do I start?— Hence, phantoms, and chimeras! Brains racked like mine should ne'er divine When plagues and storms are near us. Since crimes have shed, on this crowned head, Such undreamt power and splendour, To crimes I turn!—let kingdoms burn, And scorch up to a cinder! Through blood I wade! (my thriving trade) By this I've gained dominion. Should Fate rebel, secured in hell, I've one firm bond of union! Old Nick and I have learnt to vie, Which should excel the other; Old Nick and me can't disagree, He owns me for his brother. By him I rose, and crushed my foes; From him I learnt each lesson; When all hope's flown, firm on his throne, I'm sure of joint possession.— Up then, proud heart!—no more I start: To valour pride is given! Better in hell (as poets tell) To reign, than serve in heaven!’ Down sunk the sprite to dismal night! Deep roared each blast and billow! He sunk opprest, to find some rest, But sleep still fled his pillow!— Learn hence, ye great! mid pomp and state, What lawless power embitters, Not all that's high can peace supply; Not all is gold that glitters! THE LINKS O'FORTH: OR, A PARTING PEEP AT THE CARSE O'STIRLING. He woo'd the muse, and sung the pensive strain; He loved meek solitude, and softened gloom;— STERLING'S CAMBUSCAN, V. 304. [Yes! I've perused, with new, increased delight] The following elegant Lines were sent to the Author by the ingenious Writer of the Hindoo Rajah, Modern Philosophers, &amp;c. on reading the Links o'Forth, in Manuscript. Yes! I've perused, with new, increased delight Have reperused, each simply flowing line: Traced the known landscape bursting on the sight, With all its varied hues and haunts divine! Still (by the muse's faithful hand pourtrayed) Each long-lost beauty meets my raptured eye; Youth's former visions rise in every glade, While tears delicious mix with memory's sigh. Say then, my friend, can feelings warm as these Perform the critic's cold fastidious part; Mark what perchance the pedant might displease, When nature's nameless charms attack the heart! For me, I boast nor critic lore nor skill, Nor classic laws for measured numbers know; Enough, to feel the bosom's raptured thrill, The tear that starts—the heart's spontaneous glow! These! these the muse's magic power attest! These! these the poet's excellence proclaim; And these, while truth and nature warm the breast, Shall deck Forth's artless bard with wreaths of fame. Eliza Hamilton. THE LINKS O'FORTH. Ah! winding Forth!—smooth wandering tide! O'Strevlin's peerless plain the pride; How pleased alang thy verdant side, Whar floweries spring, The muse her untaught numbers tried, And learnt to sing! Whan ardent youth, wi' boiling blood, Ilk trace o'glowing passion loo'd. How aft aside thy silver flood, Unseen, alane, The bard, enrapt in pensive mood, Has poured the strain! To beauteous Laura, aft and lang, His artless lyre he trembling strang; Close to his beating heart it hang, While glen, and grove, And craig, and echoing valley, rang Wi' fervent love.— Poor, fond enthusiast! whither stray? By wimpling burn, or broomy brae? Wasting, I ween, the live-lang day In am'rous rhime; The hour will come, thou'lt sigh, and say, What loss o'time! Yet, wherefore shou'd nae youth engage In pleasures suited to its age? To catch the tids o'life is sage, Some joys to save: Wha kens the fights he's doomed to wage This side the grave! To sport on fancy's flowery brink, And beek a wee in love's warm blink, Is wiser far, I'm sure, than think O'distant harm, Whan eild and cauld indiff'rence shrink Frae pleasure's charm. Then strike, sweet muse! the trembling lyre, Ance mair do thou the song inspire;— Ah! check nae yet the glowing fire, Though health divine, And youth, and pleasure's fond desire, Fast, fast decline! Attune the lay! when nature's charm First seized his bosom, fluttering warm; Ere care yet came, wi' dread alarm, Or friendship's guile; Or fortune, wi' uplifted arm, And treach'rous smile.

Round ‘Carun's stream,’ o'classic name, Whar Fingal fought, and ay ow'rcame Vide the war of Caros, and the beautiful poem Comala.; Whar Ossian wak'd, wi' kindling flame, His heaven-taught lays, And sang his Oscar's deathless fame At Dunipáce Vide the war of Caros, and the beautiful poem Comala.! —Names, gratefu' to the patriot's ear! Which Scotia's sons delight to hear!— Names, that the brave will lang revere Wi' valour's sigh! —Dear to the Muse!—but doubly dear To Liberty!’— Thus, (blind to prudence' warning light) Aft sighed and sang the pensive wight!— Reckless, alas! o'fortune's blight, Or warldly blame, He'd muse, and dream, till dark midnight, Then daunder hame!— Ye flowering plains and winding stream! Ye stately towers! whar morn's first beam Mild glittering glints wi' gowden gleam! Yours was the crime: Ye first enticed his youth to dream In thriftless rhime! Ye first unlocked the secret door That led to Nature's varied store; And taught him early to adore Her tempting smile, Whether on India's pictured shore Or Britain's isle.— Ye classic fields, whar valour bled! Whar patriots fell, but never fled! Ye plains, wi' smiling plenty clad, A lang adieu! A dark'ning cloud, wi' ills ow'rspread, Obscures the view! A warning voice, sad owre the main Cries, ‘haste ye!—haste!—break aff the strain:— Strevlina's towers and peerless plain Ye'll ne'er review!’— Dear haunts o'youth, and love's saft pain, A last adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. SCOTLAND'S SCAITH; OR, THE HISTORY OF WILL AND JEAN: OWRE TRUE A TALE! So shall thy poverty come, as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man. —Prov. TO DAVID DOIG, LL. D. F.S.S.A. MASTER OF THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL, STIRLING. PART I. Wha was ance like Willie Gairlace, Wha in neighbouring town or farm? Beauty's bloom shone in his fair face, Deadly strength was in his arm! Wha wi' Will could rin or wrastle? Throw the sledge, or toss the bar? Hap what would, he stood a castle, Or for safety, or for war: Warm his heart, and mild as manfu', With the bauld he bauld could be; But to friends wha had their handfu', Purse and service aye ware free. Whan he first saw Jeanie Miller, Wha wi' Jeanie could compare?— Thousands had mair braws and siller, But ware ony half sae fair? Saft her smile raise like May morning, Glinting o'er Demait's One of the Ochil hills, near Stirling. Dun-ma-chit (Gaelic), the hill of the good prospect. It is pronounced Demyit. brow: Sweet! wi' opening charms adorning Strevlin's The ancient name of Stirling. lovely plains below! Kind and gentle was her nature; At ilk place she bore the bell;— Sic a bloom, and shape, and stature! But her look nae tongue can tell! Such was Jean, whan Will first mawing, Spied her on a thraward beast; Flew like fire, and just whan fa'ing Kept her on his manly breast. Light he bore her, pale as ashes, Cross the meadow, fragrant, green! Placed her on the new-mawn rashes, Watching sad her opening een. Such was Will, whan poor Jean fainting Drapt into a lover's arms; Wakened to his saft lamenting; Sighed, and blushed a thousand charms. Soon they loo'd, and soon were buckled; Nane took time to think and rue.— Youth and worth and beauty cuppled; Love had never less to do. Three short years flew by fu' canty, Jean and Will thought them but ane; Ilka day brought joy and plenty, Ilka year a dainty wean; Will wrought sair, but aye with pleasure; Jean, the hale day, spun and sang; Will and weans, her constant treasure, Blest with them, nae day seemed lang; Trig her house, and oh! to busk aye Ilk sweet bairn was a' her pride!— But at this time news and whisky Sprang nae up at ilk road-side. Luckless was the hour when Willie, Hame returning frae the fair, O'er-took Tam, a neighbour billie, Sax miles frae their hame and mair; Simmer's heat had lost its fury; Calmly smiled the sober e'en; Lasses on the bleachfield hurry Skelping barefoot o'er the green; Labour rang with laugh and clatter, Canty hairst was just begun, And on mountain, tree, and water, Glinted saft the setting sun. Will and Tam, with hearts a'lowping, Marked the hale, but could nae bide; Far frae hame, nae time for stopping, Baith wished for their ain fire-side: On they travelled, warm and drouthy, Cracking o'er the news in town; The mair they cracked, the mair ilk youthy Prayed for drink to wash news down. Fortune, wha but seldom listens To poor merit's modest prayer, And on fools heaps needless blessins, Harkened to our drouthy pair; In a howm, whase bonnie burnie Whimperin rowed its crystal flood, Near the road, whar trav'lers turn aye, Neat and bield a cot-house stood; White the wa's, wi' roof new theekit, Window broads just painted red; Lown 'mang trees and braes it reekit, Haflins seen and haflins hid; Up the gavel-end thick spreading. Crap the clasping ivy green, Back owre, firs the high craigs cleading, Raised a'round a cozey screen; Down below, a flowery meadow Joined the burnie's rambling line;— Here it was, that Howe, the widow, This same day set up her sign. Brattling down the brae, and near its Bottom, Will first marv'ling sees ‘Porter, Ale, and British Spirits,’ Painted bright between twa trees. ‘Godsake! Tam, here's walth for drinking;— (Wha can this new comer be?’) ‘Hoot! quo Tam, there's drouth in thinking— Let's in, Will, and syne we'll see.’ Nae mair time they took to speak or Think of ought but reaming jugs; Till three times in humming liquor Ilk lad deeply laid his lugs. Slockened now, refreshed and talking, In cam Meg (weel skilled to please) ‘Sirs! ye're surely tired wi' walking;— Ye maun taste my bread and cheese.’ ‘Thanks, quo Will;—I canna tarry, Pick mirk night is setting in, Jean, poor thing's! her lane, and eery— I maun to the road and rin.’ ‘Hoot! quo' Tam, what's a'the hurry! Hame's now scarce a mile o'gate— Come! sit down—Jean winna wearie: Lord! I'm sure it's no sae late!’ Will, o'ercome with Tam's oration, Baith fell to, and ate their fill— ‘Tam,’ quo' Will, ‘in meer discretion, We maun hae the widow's gill.’ After ae gill cam anither— Meg sat cracking 'tween them twa, Bang! cam in Mat Smith and's brither, Geordie Brown and Sandie Shaw. Neighbours wha ne'er thought to meet here, Now sat down wi' double glee, Ilka gill grew sweet and sweeter!— Will got hame 'tween twa and three. Jean, poor thing! had lang been greetin; Will, next morning, blamed Tam Lowes, But ere lang, a weekly meetin Was set up at Maggie Howe's. END OF THE FIRST PART. PART II. Maist things hae a sma' beginning, But wha kens how things will end? Weekly clubs are nae great sinning, If folk hae enough to spend. But nae man o'sober thinking E'er will say that things can thrive, If there's spent in weekly drinking What keeps wife and weans alive. Drink maun aye hae conversation, Ilka social soul allows; But, in this reforming nation, Wha can speak without the news? News, first meant for state physicians, Deeply skilled in courtly drugs; Now, whan a'are politicians, Just to set folks by the lugs.— Maggie's club, wha could get nae light On some things that should be clear, Found ere lang the fault, and ae night Clubbed, and got the Gazetteer The Edinburgh Gazetteer, a violent opposition paper, published in 1793–4.. Twice a week to Maggie's cot-house, Swift! by post the papers fled! Thoughts spring up like plants in hot-house, Every time the news are read. Ilk ane's wiser than anither,— ‘Things are no ga'en right,’ quo' Tam, ‘Let us aftener meet thegither; Twice a week's no worth a d?n.’ See them now in grave convention, To mak a'things ‘square and even;’ Or at least wi' firm intention To drink sax nights out o'seven. Mid this sitting up and drinking, Gathering a'the news that fell; Will, wha was nae yet past thinking, Had some battles wi' himsell. On ae hand, drink's deadly poison Bare ilk firm resolve awa; On the ither, Jean's condition Rave his very heart in twa. Weel he saw her smothered sorrow! Weel he saw her bleaching cheek! Marked the smile she strave to borrow, When, poor thing, she could nae speak! Jean, at first, took little heed o' Weekly clubs mang three or four, Thought, kind soul! that Will had need o' Heartsome hours whan wark was owre. But whan now that nightly meetings Sat and drank frae sax till twa; Whan she faund that hard-earned gettings Now on drink ware thrown awa; Saw her Will, wha ance sae cheerie Raise ilk morning wi' the lark, Now grown mauchless, dowf and sweer aye To look near his farm or wark; Saw him tyne his manly spirit, Healthy bloom, and sprightly ee; And o'love and hame grown wearit, Nightly frae his family flee;— Wha could blame her heart's complaining? Wha condemn her sorrows meek? Or the tears that now ilk e'ening Bleached her lately crimsoned cheek!— Will, wha lang had rued and swithered, (Aye ashamed o'past disgrace) Marked the roses as they withered Fast on Jeanie's lovely face! Marked,—and felt wi' inward racking, A'the wyte lay wi' himsel,— Swore next night he'd mak a breaking,— D?d the club and news to hell! But, alas! whan habit's rooted, Few hae pith the root to pu'; Will's resolves were aye nonsuited, Promised aye, but aye got fou; Aye at first at the convening Moralized on what was right,— Yet o'er clavers entertaining Dozed and drank till brade day-light. Things at length draw near an ending; Cash runs out; Jean, quite unhappy, Sees that Will is now past mending, Tynes a'heart, and taks a—drappy The author cannot refrain from seizing the last opportunity he may ever have, to caution his female readers against the vice, here intentionally introduced. Women are not sufficiently aware of the danger annexed to the smallest indulgence in spirituous liquors. A delicate frame, or a susceptible mind, experiencing a temporary relief from a pernicious stimulus, has recourse to it at a time when the best cordials are fortitude and resignation. Hence the deplorable habit of dram-drinking—a habit the most disgusting! —the most degrading to the female character!! Ilka drink deserves a posey; Port maks men rude, claret civil; Beer maks Britons stout and rosy, Whisky maks ilk wife—a devil. Jean, wha lately bore affliction Wi' sae meek and mild an air, Schooled by whisky, learns new tricks soon, Flytes, and storms, and rugs Will's hair. Jean, sae late the tenderest mither, Fond of ilk dear dauted wean! Now, heart-hardened a'thegither, Skelps them round frae morn till e'en. Jean, wha vogie, loo'd to busk aye In her hame-spun, thrifty wark; Now sells a'her braws for whisky, To her last gown, coat, and sark! Robin Burns, in mony a ditty, Loudly sings in whisky's praise; Sweet his sang!—the mair's the pity E'er on it he wared sic lays. Of a'the ills poor Caledonia E'er yet pree'd, or e'er will taste, Brewed in hell's black Pandemonia, Whisky's ill will scaith her maist!— ‘Wha was ance like Willie Gairlace! Wha in neighbouring town or farm? Beauty's bloom shone in his fair face, Deadly strength was in his arm! ‘Whan he first saw Jeanie Miller, Wha wi' Jeanie could compare? Thousands had mair braws and siller, But were ony half sae fair?’ See them now—how changed wi' drinking! A'their youthfu' beauty gane!— Davered, doited, daized and blinking, Worn to perfect skin and bane! In the cauld month o'November, (Claise, and cash, and credit out) Cowring o'er a dying ember, Wi' ilk face as white's a clout; Bond and bill, and debts a'stopped, Ilka sheaf selt on the bent; Cattle beds, and blankets rouped, Now to pay the laird his rent; No another night to lodge here! No a friend their cause to plead! He ta'en on to be a sodger, She, wi' weans, to beg her bread! ‘O’ a'the ills poor Caledonia E'er yet pree'd, or e'er will taste, Brewed in hell's black Pandemonia, Whisky's ill will scaith her maist!! THE WAES O'WAR: OR, THE UPSHOT OF THE HISTORY OF WILL AND JEAN. IN FOUR PARTS. ? Felices ter et amplius Quos adversa docet Sors sapientiam. Boeth. Thrice happy pair, Wha wit frae luckless Fortune lear! PART I. Oh! that folk wad weel consider What it is to tyne a—name, What this warld is a'thegither, If bereft of honest fame! Poortith ne'er can bring dishonour; Hardships ne'er breed sorrow's smart, If bright conscience taks upon her To shed sunshine round the heart: But wi' a'that wealth can borrow, Guilty shame will aye look down; What maun then shame, want, and sorrow, Wandering sad frae town to town! Jeanie Miller, ance sae cheerie! Ance sae happy, good, and fair, Left by Will, next morning drearie, Taks the road o'black despair! Cauld the blast!—the day was sleeting; Pouch and purse without a plack! In ilk hand a bairnie greeting, And the third tied on her back. Wan her face! and lean and hagard! Ance sae sonsy! ance sae sweet! What a change!—unhoused and beggared, Starving, without claise or meat! Far frae ilk kent spot she wandered, Skulking like a guilty thief; Here and there, uncertain, daundered, Stupified wi' shame and grief: But soon shame for bygane errors Fled owre fast for ee to trace, When grim death, wi' a'his terrors, Cam o'er ilk sweet bairnie's face! Spent wi' toil, and cauld and hunger, Baith down drapt! and down Jean sat! ‘Daised and doited’ now nae langer; Thought—and felt—and bursting grat. Gloaming fast wi' mirky shadow Crap o'er distant hill and plain; Darkened wood, and glen, and meadow, Adding fearfu' thoughts to pain! Round and round, in wild distraction, Jeanie turned her tearfu' ee! Round and round for some protection!— Face nor house she could na see! Dark, and darker grew the night aye; Loud and sair the cauld winds thud! Jean now spied a sma bit lightie Blinking through a distant wood: Up wi' frantic haste she started; Cauld, nor fear, she felt nae mair; Hope, for ae bright moment, darted Through the gloom of dark despair! Fast o'er fallowed lea she brattled; Deep she wade through bog and burn; Sair wi' steep and craig she battled, Till she reached the hoped sojourn. Proud, 'mang scenes of simple nature, Stately auld, a mansion stood On a bank, whase sylvan feature Smiled out-o'er the roaring flood: Summer here, in varied beauty Late her flowery mantle spread, Where auld chesnut, ake, and yew-tree, Mingling, lent their friendly shade: Blasted now, wi' winter's ravage; A'their gaudy livery cast; Wood and glen, in wailings savage, Howl and murmur to the blast! Darkness stalked wi' fancy's terror;— Mountains moved, and castle rocked! Jean, half dead wi' toil and horror, Reached the door, and loudly knocked. ‘Wha this rudely wakes the sleeping?’ Cried a voice wi' angry grane; ‘Help! oh help!’ quo Jeanie, weeping, ‘Help my infants, or they're gane! ‘Nipt wi' cauld!—wi' hunger fainting! Baith lie speechless on the lea! Help!’ quo Jeanie, loud lamenting, ‘Help my lammies! or they'll die!’ ‘Wha this travels cauld and hungry, Wi' young bairns sae late at e'en? Beggars!’ cried the voice, mair angry, ‘Beggars! wi' their brats, I ween.’ ‘Beggars now, alas! wha lately Helpt the beggar and the poor!’ ‘Fye! gudeman! cried ane discreetly, ‘Taunt nae poortith at our door. ‘Sic a night, and tale thegither, Plead for mair than anger's din:— Rise, Jock!’ cried the pitying mither, ‘Rise! and let the wretched in.’ ‘Beggars now, alas! wha lately Helpt the beggar and the poor!’ ‘Enter!’ quo' the youth fu' sweetly, While up flew the open door. ‘Beggar, or what else, sad mourner! Enter without fear or dread; Here, thank God! there's aye a corner To defend the houseless head! ‘For your bairnies cease repining; If in life, ye'll see them soon.’— Aff he flew; and brightly shining Through the dark clouds brak the moon. PART II. Here, for ae night's kind protection, Leave we Jean and weans a while; Tracing Will in ilk direction, Far frae Britain's fostering isle! Far frae scenes o'saftening pleasure, Love's delights and beauty's charms! Far frae friends and social leisure,— Plunged in murdering War's alarms! Is it nature, vice, or folly, Or ambition's feverish brain, That so oft wi' melancholy Turns, sweet Peace! thy joys to pain! Strips thee of thy robes of ermin, (Emblems of thy spotless life) And in War's grim look alarming, Arms thee with the murd'rer's knife! A'thy gentle mind upharrows! Hate, revenge, and rage uprears! And for hope and joy—(twin marrows), Leaves the mourner drowned in tears! Willie Gairlace, without siller, Credit, claise, or ought beside, Leaves his ance-loved Jeanie Miller, And sweet bairns, to warld wide! Leaves his native cozy dwelling, Sheltered haughs, and birken braes; Greenswaird hows, and dainty mealing, Ance his profit, pride and praise! Deckt wi' scarlet, sword, and musket, Drunk wi' dreams as fause as vain; Fleeched and flattered, roosed and buskit, Wow! but Will was wond'rous fain! Rattling, roaring, swearing, drinking; How could thought her station keep? Drams and drumming (faes to thinking) Dozed reflection fast asleep. But in midst of toils and dangers, Wi' the cauld ground for his bed, Compassed round with faes and strangers, Soon Will's dreams o'fancy fled. Led to battle's blood-dy'd banners, Waving to the widow's moan! Will saw glory's boasted honours End in life's expiring groan! Round Valenciennes' strong waa'd city, Thick o'er Dunkirk's fatal plain, Will (tho' dauntless) saw wi' pity Britain's valiant sons lie slain! Fired by freedom's burning fever, Gallia struck death's slaughtering knell; Frae the Scheld to Rhine's deep river, Britons fought—but Britons fell! Fell unaided! though cemented By the faith of friendship's laws; Fell unpity'd—unlamented! Bleeding in a thankless cause Alluding to the conduct of the Dutch.! In the thrang of comrades deeing, Fighting foremost o'them a'; Swift! fate's winged ball cam fleeing, And took Willie's leg awa: Thrice frae aff the ground he started, Thrice to stand he strave in vain; Thrice, as fainting strength departed, Sighed—and sank 'mang hundreds slain.— On a cart wi' comrades bluiding, Stiff wi' gore, and cauld as clay; Without cover, bed or bedding, Five lang nights Will Gairlace lay! In a sick-house, damp and narrow, (Left behint wi' mony mair) See Will next, in pain and sorrow, Wasting on a bed of care. Wounds, and pain, and burning fever, Doctors cured wi' healing art;— Cured! alas!—but never! never! Cooled the fever at his heart! For when a'were sound and sleeping, Still and on, baith ear and late, Will in briny grief lay steeping, Mourning o'er his hapless fate! A'his gowden prospects vanished! A'his dreams o'warlike fame!— A'his glittering phantoms banished! Will could think o'nought but—hame! Think o'nought but rural quiet, Rural labour! rural ploys! Far frae carnage, blood, and riot, War, and a'its murd'ring joys. PART III. Back to Britain's fertile garden Will's returned (exchanged for faes), Wi' ae leg, and no ae farden, Friend, or credit, meat, or claise. Lang through county, burgh, and city, Crippling on a wooden leg, Gathering alms frae melting pity; See! poor Gairlace forced to beg! Placed at length on Chelsea's bounty, Now to langer beg thinks shame, Dreams ance mair o'smiling plenty;— Dreams o'former joys, and hame! Hame! and a'its fond attractions Fast to Will's warm bosom flee; While the thoughts o'dear connexions Swell his heart, and blind his ee.— “Monster! wha could leave neglected Three sma' infants and a wife, Naked—starving—unprotected!— Them, too, dearer ance than life! “Villain! wha wi' graceless folly Ruined her he ought to save!— Changed her joys to melancholy, Beggary, and,—perhaps, a grave!” Starting!—wi' remorse distracted,— Crushed wi' grief's increasing load, Up he banged; and, sair afflicted, Sad and silent took the road! Sometimes briskly, sometimes flaggin, Sometimes helpit, Will got forth; On a cart, or in a waggon, Hirpling ay towards the north. Tired ae e'ening, stepping hooly, Pondering on his thraward fate, In the bonny month o'July, Willie, heedless, tint his gate. Saft the southlan breeze was blawing, Sweetly sughed the green ake wood! Loud the din o'streams fast fa'ing, Strak the ear wi' thundering thud; Ewes and lambs on braes ran bleeting; Linties chirped on ilka tree; Frae the wast, the sun, near setting, Flamed on Roslin's towers Roslin Castle. sae hie! Roslin's towers! and braes sae bonny! Craigs and water, woods and glen! Roslin's banks! unpeered by ony, Save the muses' Hawthornden The ancient seat of the celebrated poet William Drummond, who flourished in 1585.! Ilka sound and charm delighting; Will (tho' hardly fit to gang) Wandered on through scenes inviting, List'ning to the mavis' sang. Faint at length, the day fast closing, On a fragrant strawberry steep, Esk's sweet stream to rest composing, Wearied nature drapt asleep. “Soldier, rise!—the dews o'e'ening Gathering fa', wi' deadly scaith!— Wounded soldier! if complaining, Sleep nae here and catch your death. “Traveller, waken!—night advancing Cleads wi' grey the neighbouring hill! Lambs nae mair on knows are dancing— A'the woods are mute and still!” “What hae I,” cried Willie, waking, “What hae I frae night to dree?— Morn, through clouds in splendour breaking, Lights nae bright'ning hope to me! “House, nor hame, nor farm, nor stedding! Wife nor bairns hae I to see! House, nor hame! nor bed, nor bedding— What hae I frae night to dree?” “Sair, alas! and sad and many Are the ills poor mortals share!— Yet, tho' hame nor bed ye hae nae, Yield nae, soldier, to despair! “What's this life, sae wae and wearie, If Hope's bright'ning beams should fail!— See!—tho' night comes dark and eerie, Yon sma' cot-light cheers the dale! “There, tho' wealth and waste ne'er riot, Humbler joys their comforts shed, Labour—health—content and quiet! Mourner! there ye'll find a bed. “Wife! 'tis true, wi' bairnies smiling, There, alas! ye needna seek— Yet there bairns, ilk wae beguiling, Paint wi' smiles a mother's cheek! “A'her earthly pride and pleasure Left to cheer her widowed lot! A'her warldly wealth and treasure To adorn her lanely cot! “Cheer, then, soldier! 'midst affliction Bright'ning joys will aften shine; Virtue aye claims Heaven's protection— Trust to Providence divine!” PART IV. Sweet as Rosebank's Rosebank, near Roslin; the author's place of nativity. woods and river Cool whan simmer's sunbeams dart, Came ilk word, and cooled the fever That lang burned at Willie's heart. Silent stept he on, foor fallow! Listening to his guide before, O'er green know, and flowery hallow, Till they reached the cot-house door. Laigh it was; yet sweet, tho' humble! Deckt wi' honeysuckle round; Clear below, Esk's waters rumble, Deep glens murmuring back the sound. Melville's towers Melville Castle, the seat of the Right Honourable Henry Dundas., sae white and stately, Dim by gloamin glint to view; Through Lasswade's dark woods keek sweetly Skies sae red, and lift sae blue! Entering now, in transport mingle Mother fond, and happy wean, Smiling round a canty ingle, Bleazing on a clean hearth-stane. “Soldier, welcome!—come, be cheery!— Here ye'se rest, and tak your bed— Faint,—waes me! ye seem, and weary, Pale's your cheek, sae lately red!” “Changed I am,” sighed Willie till her; “Changed, nae doubt, as changed can be! Yet, alas! does Jeanie Miller Nought o'Willie Gairlace see!” Hae ye markt the dews o'morning Glittering in the sunny ray, Quickly fa', when, without warning, Rough blasts came, and shook the spray? Hae ye seen the bird fast fleeing Drap, whan pierced by death mair fleet? Then, see Jean, wi' colour deeing, Senseless drap at Willie's feet! After three lang years affliction, (A'their waes now hushed to rest,) Jean ance mair, in fond affection, Clasps her Willie to her breast. Tells him a'her sad—sad sufferings! How she wandered, starving, poor, Gleaning pity's scanty offerings Wi' three bairns frae door to door! How she served—and toiled—and fevered, Lost her health, and syne her bread; How that grief, whan scarce recovered, Took her brain, and turned her head! How she wandered round the county Many a live-lang night her lane! Till at last an angel's bounty Brought her senses back again: Gae her meat,—and claise,—and siller; Gae her bairnies wark and lear; Lastly, gae this cot-house till her, Wi' four sterling pounds a-year! Willie, harkening, wiped his een aye; “Oh! what sins hae I to rue! But say, wha's this angel, Jeanie?” “Wha,” quo Jeanie, “but Buccleugh The Duchess of Buccleugh; the unwearied patroness and supporter of the afflicted and the poor.!” Here, supported, cheered, and cherished, Nine blest months, I've lived, and mair; Seen these infants clad and nourished; Dried my tears; and tint despair; Sometimes serving, sometimes spinning, Light the lanesome hours gae round; Lightly, too, ilk quarter rinning Brings yon angel's helping pound! “Eight pounds mair,” cried Willie, fondly, “Eight pounds mair will do nae harm! And, O Jean! gin friends were kindly, Twall pounds soon might stock a farm. “There, ance mair, to thrive by plewin, Freed frae a'that peace destroys, Idle waste and druken ruin! War, and a'its murdering joys!” Thrice he kissed his lang-lost treasure! Thrice ilk bairn; but cou'dna speak: Tears of love, and hope, and pleasure Streamed in silence down his cheek! To C. L. Esq.

TO THE MEMBERS OF THE SOBER SOCIETY; SENT WITH AN ENGRAVING This engraving had been at some period thrown off for the use of a literary society in London, likewise called the Sober Society. The representation was a female figure, with the finger of one hand pointing to the moon (horned) and six stars overhead; and the finger of the other hand pointing to the ground, with this motto —Virtus tandem Vigebat.. Dear sober emptyers o'the glass! Behold your goddess—wife, or lass, De'il hae me gin I ken; But weel I wat, gin a'be true, That here she speaks, ye select few Are unco kind o'men! To me (as frankly in a crack The ither night the jillet spak Right cheery owre a glass,) Though hid frae unpoetic brain, These hieroglyphics speak as plain As e'er did Balaam's ass. Ilk sober brither sure has seen The moon and seven stars at e'en Glittering in spangled heaven; What mean then sax?—the meaning's clear.— Through a'your meetings in the year Ye're fou sax times in seven. Na, mair—by yonder horned moon, Its clear ye're a'horn-mad as soon As clocks Beate six One of the rules of the Sober Club was, that the bill should be called for and paid at eleven o'clock; after which hour every one might do as he inclined; i. e. retire, or remain as long as he chose; and as this last liberty was generally productive of sober happiness, it was called the Beate.; Sweet! sweet the sounding warning comes! And, sitting down on stubborn bums, Ye a'turn—lunatics. O! then, 'tis said, in canty croon, A writer chiel ca'd Livingston, Wi' crack and snuff grows cheery; And dealing round strong punch and joke, Good-humoured mad, near twa o'clock Turns a'things tapsilteery! Here wad I stap, nor langer keek Into thae soberings ilka week, And hide what I'm no able; But yon d?d fingers—up and down, Proclaim whan some are in the moon, Some lie aneth the table. In these blessed French perverted days These lines were written during the commencement of Robespierre's reign of justice, virtue, and humanity., Whan virtue's blamed, and vice gets praise, And folk wi' words are sae bit, Nae wonder sober stands for fou, And drinkers roar out, while they spew, ‘Virtus tandem Vigebat.’ THE ROSE O'KIRTLE. A BALLAD. In Roslin's bowers bloom fragrant flowers, On Yarrow's banks they're mony; Whar Kirtle A small, beautiful stream, in Annandale. flows ance stately rose The sweetest flower o'ony! I've travelled east, I've travelled west, I've been 'mang groves o'myrtle; Tho' flowers bloomed fair, nane could compare Wi' the sweet Rose o'Kirtle. In secret glade it raised its head, And fair its leaves spread blooming! And as they spread, they fragrance shed A'Kirtle's banks perfuming! Lured by its fame, the young anes came, (Some came frae west the Shannon) And ilk ane swore, nae flower before Bloomed like the rose o'Annan.— But wise anes knew a death-worm grew Deep at its roots consuming; And while they sighed, they mournfu' cried, ‘The rose will fade that's blooming!’ 'Twas then Fate said, ‘frae native glade We'll pu' the pride o'Kirtle; In warmer bower we'll plant the flower, And skreen it round wi' myrtle.’ Sae, Fate updrew the flower, and flew Where Mersey's The river that runs past Liverpool. stream rows flowing; There, skreened frae harm, they plant it warm, For there Love's beams were glowing! Fair, fair it spread! and gratefu' shed Its healing balms, sweet smelling! And as they flew, Affliction knew Blest Health was near his dwelling. Oh! had ye been where I hae seen This rose 'mang myrtles blooming, Ye wad hae sworn nae canker worm Was fast its roots consuming:— But, welladay! looks will betray! And Death love's joys will sever!— Ere midnight hour, Death nipt the flower!— Its sweets are—gone for ever! Ye, wha can smile at Life's fause guile, While Health's warm sun shines beamy, Learn, that the flower o'Mersey's bower Was Lucy's peerless Jeamie; And ye wha mourn at Currie's urn Dr James Currie, late of Liverpool., Or weep by Mersey's river, Learn, that the rose that virtue blows, Though dead, will—bloom for ever! SONGS. THE LAMMIE. Air—Name unknown. ‘Whar hae ye been a'day, my boy Tammy? Whar hae ye been a'day, my boy Tammy?’ ‘I've been by burn and flowery brae, Meadow green, and mountain grey, Courting o'this young thing, Just come frae her mammy.’ ‘And whar gat ye that young thing, My boy Tammy?’ ‘I gat her down in yonder how, Smiling on a broomy know, Herding ae wee lamb and ewe For her poor mammy.’ ‘What said ye to the bonie bairn, My boy Tammy?’ ‘I praised her een, sae lovely blue, Her dimpled cheek, and cherry mou;— I pree'd it aft as ye may true!— She said, she'd tell her mammy. I held her to my beating heart, My young, my smiling lammie! ‘I hae a house, it cost me dear, I've walth o'plenishen and geer; Ye'se get it a'war't ten times mair, Gin ye will leave your mammy.’ The smile gade aff her bonie face— ‘I maun nae leave my mammy; She's gi'en me meat, she's gi'en me claise, She's been my comfort a'my days:— My father's death brought mony waes!— I canna leave my mammy.’ ‘We'll tak her hame and mak her fain, My ain kind-hearted lammie! We'll gie her meat, we'll gie her claise, We'll be her comfort a'her days.’ The wee thing gie's her hand, and says,— ‘There! gang, and ask my mammy.’ ‘Has she been to kirk wi' thee, My boy Tammy?’ ‘She has been to kirk wi' me, And the tear was in her ee,— But O! she's but a young thing Just come frae her mammy.’ I LOO'D NE'ER A LADDIE BUT ANE. Air—My lodging is on the cold ground. I loo'd ne'er a laddie but ane, He loo'd ne'er a lassie but me; He's willing to mak me his ain, And his ain I am willing to be. He has coft me a rocklay o'blue, And a pair o'mittens o'green; The price was a kiss o'my mou', And I paid him the debt yestreen. Let ithers brag weel o'their gear, Their land, and their lordly degree; I carena for ought but my dear, For he's ilka thing lordlie to me; His words are sae sugared, sae sweet! His sense drives ilk fear far awa! I listen—poor fool! and I greet, Yet O! sweet are the tears as they fa'! ‘Dear lassie,’ he cries wi' a jeer, ‘Ne'er heed what the auld anes will say; Though we've little to brag o'—ne'er fear, What's gowd to a heart that is wae? Our laird has baith honours and wealth, Yet see how he's dwining wi' care; Now we, tho' we've naithing but health, Are canty and leil evermair. ‘O Marion! the heart that is true Has something mair costly than gear, Ilk e'en it has naithing to rue; Ilk morn it has naithing to fear. Ye warldlings! gae, hoard up your store, And tremble for fear ought ye tyne: Guard your treasures wi' lock, bar, and door, While here in my arms I lock mine!’ He ends wi' a kiss and a smile— Waes me! can I tak it amiss? My laddie's unpractised in guile, He's free ay to daut and to kiss! Ye lassies, wha loo to torment Your wooers wi' fause scorn and strife, Play your pranks—I hae gi'en my consent, And this night I am Jamie's for life. O TELL ME HOW FOR TO WOO. Air—Bonny Dundee. Oh! tell me, bonie young lassie! Oh tell me how for to woo! Oh tell me, bonie sweet lassie! Oh tell me how for to woo! Say, maun I roose your cheeks like the morning? Lips like the roses fresh moistened wi' dew! Say, I maun I roose your een's pawkie scorning?— Oh! tell me how for to woo! Far hae I wandered to see the dear lassie! Far hae I ventured across the saut sea! Far hae I travelled owre moorland and mountain, Houseless, and weary, sleep'd cauld on the lea! Ne'er hae I tried yet to mak luve to onie; For ne'er loo'd I onie till ance I loo'd you; Now we're alane in the green-wood sae bonie, —Oh! tell me how for to woo!’ ‘What care I for your wand'ring, young laddie? What care I for your crossing the sea? It was na for naithing ye left poor young Peggy;— It was for my tocher ye cam to court me;— Say, hae ye gowd to busk me aye gawdie? Ribbans, and perlins, and breast-knots enew? A house that is canty, wi' walth in't, my laddie? Without this ye never need try for to woo.’ ‘I hae na gowd to busk ye aye gawdie; I canna buy ribbans and perlins enew; I've naithing to brag o'house, or o'plenty! I've little to gie but a heart that is true.— I cam na for tocher—I ne'er heard o'onie; I never loo'd Peggy, nor e'er brak my vow.— I've wandered, poor fool! for a face fause as bonie! —I little thought this was the way for to woo!’ ‘Our laird has fine houses, and guineas in gowpins; He's youthfu', he's blooming, and comely to see! The leddies are a'ga'en wood for the wooer, And yet, ilka e'ening, he leaves them for me!— O! saft in the gloaming his luve he discloses! And saftly yestreen, as I milked my cow, He swore that my breath it was sweeter than roses, And a'the gait hame he did naithing but woo.’ ‘Ah, Jenny! the young laird may brag o'his siller, His houses, his lands, and his lordly degree; His speeches for true luve may drap sweet as honey, But, trust me, dear Jenny! he ne'er loed like me.— The wooing o'gentry are fine words o'fashion; The faster they fa' as the heart is least true!— The dumb look o'luve's aft the best proof o'passion; —The heart that feels maist is the least fit to woo!’ ‘Hae na ye roosed my cheeks like the morning! Hae na ye roosed my cherry-red mou! Hae na ye come owre sea, moor, and mountain, What mair, Johnie, need ye to woo? Far hae ye wandered, I ken, my dear laddie! Now, that ye've found me, there's nae cause to rue; Wi' health we'll hae plenty—I'll never gang gawdie,— I ne'er wished for mair than a heart that is true.’ She hid her fair face in her true lover's bosom; The saft tear o'transport filled ilk lover's ee; The burnie ran sweet by their side as they sabbit, And sweet sang the mavis aboon on the tree.— He clasped her, he pressed her, and ca'd her his hinny, And aften he tasted her hinny-sweet mou; And aye 'tween ilk kiss she sighed to her Johnie— ‘Oh! laddie! weel can ye woo!’ TAK TENT, AND BE WARY ‘Hech! lass, but ye're canty and vogie! Wow! but your een look pauky and roguie! What war ye doing, Kate, down in yon bogie, Up in the morning sae airy and grey?’ ‘I've been wi' somebody!—what need ye to speer? I've been wi' young Jamie!—I've been wi' my dear! —God save me! my mither will miss me, I fear!— D'ye ken, lass! he's courting me a'the lang day!’ ‘O Kate, tak tent, and be wary! Jamie's a sad ane!—he never will marry; Think o'poor Tibby;—he's left her to carry Black burning shame till the day that she'll die!’ ‘I carena for Tibby—a glaiket young quean! Her gaits wi' the fallows we a'ken lang syne!— The heart o' my laddie, I never can tyne! He promised to marry me down on yon lea! ‘O no! I need na be wary!— Yes! yes! he means for to marry! Wi' mony sweet kisses he ca'd me his deary, And swore he wad tak me afore Beltan day.’ ‘O Kate! Kate! he'll deceive ye! (The de'el tak the chiel! he does naithing but grieve me!) He's fou o'deceit!—gin ye like to believe me, The fause loon last night tald the same tale to me.’ ‘Dear Jean! but ye're unco camstary! Ye'll ne'er let a bodie trou ever they'll marry!— Ye've now gi'en me something that's no light to carry, 'Twill lie at my heart till the day that I die!’ She gaed awa sighing! she gaed awa wae; Her mither flet sair for her byding away! She sat down to spin!—ne'er a word could she say, But drew out a thread wi' the tear in her ee. ‘O yes!—it's time to be wary! Jamie's a sad ane!—he ne'er means to marry! He may rise in the morning, and wait till he's wearie! He's no see my face for this year and a day!’ She raise wi' the lavroc; she milked her cow; Sat down by her leglin, and 'gan for to rue:— Young Jamie cam by—her heart lap to her mou! And she trou'd ilka word that the fause loon did say! —Hech! sirs! how lasses will vary! Sometimes they're doubtfu'—'tis then they are wary; But whan luve comes louping, they ay think we'll marry, And trust, like poor Kate, to what fause loons will say. MALLY AIKEN. AN OLD SONG REVIVED. Air—Gaelic. ‘O listen! listen, and I'll tell ye This verse is all the author ever heard of the original.— The meaning of the Gaelic chorus is, O Mally Aiken, thou art my love. How this fair maid's played her part:— First she vowed and promised to me, Now she strives to break my heart!’ Eirin O! Mally Aiken, Eirin O s'dhu ma roon. I coft you silken garters, Mally, And sleeve-knots for your tartan gown; I coft you a green necklace, Mally, To busk you whan you gade to town: You gae me kisses sweet as hinny! You gae me words mair sweeet than true; You swore you loo'd me best o'ony; —Ah! why than, Mally, break your vow! Eirin O! Mally Aiken, Eirin O s'dhu ma roon. Yon auld man came wi' wyles sae bonie, He bragged o'land and walth o'gear; He promised braws mair fine than Johnie To busk ye for the kirk and fair; He gae up tocher to your daddy;— Your mother sighed and thought o'me; But Mally wished to be a lady, And changed true luve for—high degree! Eirin O! Mally Aiken, Eirin O s'dhu ma roon. He's ta'en you hame; he's made you gawdie, He's busked you for the kirk and fair; But you had better ta'en your laddie, For happiness you'll ne'er see mair! You may gang to kirk and fair, my Mally; Your face and braws catch ilka ee,— But happiness you'll ne'er see, Mally, For breaking o'your vows to me! Eirin O! Mally Aiken, Eirin O s'dhu ma roon. TO GET A MAN. This warld is a lottery, as ilk ane may ken; There are prizes for women as weel as for men: But as far as my faither and mither can see, Though the're prizes for some, there are aye blanks for me! Though black, I am comely; my een's like a slae! Odd! I'm sure they're far better than een that are grey? Yet the lads they court Katey as fast as they can, While my father aye tells me—I'll ne'er get a man. I'm held down wi' wark frae morning till e'en, May claise ay unsnod, and my face seldom clean! How the sorrow! on me can our lads ever look, Whan I gang aye sae thief-like, as black as the crook For fairs and for preachings I hae but ae gown! (Lord! I wish I was busked like our queans in the town!) Yet whane'er I stay late—how my father he'll ban, Wi' a—‘Divil confound ye! ye'll ne'er get a man!’ My mither ay thinks I'm to sit still and spin: Whan the sogers gae by, war I felled, I maun rin; Then she roars, and she flytes (though the sam's done by Kate) Wi' a—‘Sorrow be on ye! ye'll gang a grey gate!’ I fain wad hae Jamie—but then he loos Jean; And I'd e'en tak lean Patie, tho' just skin and bane; But my faither and mither tauld baith him and Dan, That I'm three years owre young yet to hae a gudeman! A usage sae barb'rous! nae mortal can bear! —Odd! they'll drive me to madness wi' perfect despair! If I canna get Jamie, nor yet Dan nor Pate, Faith! I'll e'en tak the first chiel that comes in my gate. Gle'yd Sawnie, the haivrel, he met me yestreen, He roosed first my black hair, and syne my black een! While he dawted and kissed, though I ken he's a fool, Lord! I thought that my heart wad hae loupt out o'hool. Quo he, ‘Bonny Maggy, gin ye war mine ain, I hae house and plenty, for wife and for wean, And whan my auld daddy staps aff to the grave, Faith! we'll then had our head up as high as the lave.’ I dinna like Sawnie—he's blind o'an ee; But then he's the first's talked o'marriage to me; And whan folk are ill used they maun do what they can, Sae I'll mak them a'liars, and tak a gudeman. LASSIE WI' THE GOWDEN HAIR. Air—Gaelic. ‘Lassie wi' the gowden hair, Silken snood, and face sae fair; Lassie wi' the yellow hair, Think nae to deceive me! Lassie wi' the gowden hair, Flattering smile, and face sae fair; Fare ye weel! for never mair Johnie will believe ye! O no! Mary bawn, Mary bawn, Mary bawn Bawn (Gaelic), fair, white, generally applied to the hair., O no! Mary bawn, ye'll nae mair deceive me! Smiling, twice ye made me troo, Twice—(poor fool!) I turned to woo; Twice, fause maid! ye brak your vow, Now I've sworn to leave ye! Twice, fause maid! ye brak your vow, Twice, poor fool! I've learned to rue!— Come ye yet to mak me troo? Thrice ye'll ne'er deceive me! No! no! Mary bawn, Mary bawn, Mary bawn! O no! Mary bawn! thrice ye'll ne'er deceive me.’ Mary saw him turn to part; Deep his words sank in her heart; Soon the tears began to start— ‘Johnie, will ye leave me!’ Soon the tears began to start, Grit and gritter grew his heart!— ‘Yet ae word befort we part, Luve cou'd ne'er deceive ye! O no! Johnie dow, Johnie dow, Johnie dow Dow (Gaelic), black, generally applied to the hair., O no! Johnie dow—luve cou'd ne'er deceive ye.’ Johnie took a parting keek, Saw the tears hap owre her cheek! Pale she stood, but coudna speak!— Mary's cured o'smiling. Johnie, took anither keek— ‘Beauty's rose has left her cheek!— Pale she stands, and canna speak. This is nae beguiling. O no! Mary bawn, Mary bawn, dear Mary bawn, No, no! Mary bawn—Luve has nae beguiling. JEANIE'S BLACK EE; OR, THA MI'N AM CHODAL, 'SNA DUISGIBH MI. Air—Cauld frosty morning. The sun raise sae rosy, the grey hills adorning! Light sprang the lavroc and mounted sae hie; When true to the tryst o'blythe May's dewy morning My Jeanie cam linking out owre the green lea. To mark her impatience, I crap 'mang the brakens, Aft, aft to the kent gate she turned her black ee; Then lying down dowylie, sighed by the willow tree, ‘Ha me mohátel na dousku me I am asleep, do not waken me. The Gaelic chorus is pronounced according to the present orthography.. Saft through the green birks I sta' to my jewel, Streik'd on spring's carpet aneath the saugh tree! ‘Think na, dear lassie, thy Willie's been cruel,’— ‘Ha me mohátel na dousku me.’ ‘Wi' luve's warm sensations I've marked your impatience, Lang hid 'mang the brakens I watched your black ee.— You're no sleeping, pawkie Jean! open thae lovely een!’— ‘Ha me mohátel na dousku me.’ ‘Bright is the whin's bloom ilk green know adorning! Sweet is the primrose bespangled wi' dew! Yonder comes Peggy to welcome May morning! Dark wave her haffet locks owre her white brow! O! light! light she's dancing keen on the smooth gowany green, Barefit, and kilted half up to the knee! While Jeanie is sleeping still, I'll rin and sport my fill,’— ‘I was asleep, and ye've wakened me!’ ‘I'll rin and whirl her round; Jeanie is sleeping sound; Kiss her, and clasp her fast; nae ane can see! Sweet! sweet's her hinny mou!’—‘Will, I'm no sleeping now, I was asleep, but ye wakened me.’ Laughing, till like to drap, swith to my Jean I lap, Kissed her ripe roses, and blest her black ee! And ay since, whane'er we meet, sing, for the sound is sweet, ‘Ha me mohátel na dousku me.’ THE PLAID AMANG THE HETHER. Air—Old Highland Laddie. The wind blew hie owre muir and lea, And dark and stormy grew the weather; The rain rained sair; nae shelter near, But my luve's plaid amang the hether: O my bonie Highland lad! My winsome, weel-far'd, Highland laddie! Wha wad mind the wind and weit Sae weel row'd in his tartan plaidie? Close to his breast he held me fast; Sae cozy, warm, we lay thegither! Nae simmer heat was half sae sweet As my luve's plaid amang the hether! O my bonie, &amp;c. Mid wind and rain he tald his tale; My lightsome heart grew like a feather; It lap sae quick I coudna speak, But silent sighed amang the hether! O my bonie, &amp;c. The storm blew past; we kissed in haste; I hameward ran, and tald my mither; She gloomed at first, but soon confessed The bowls rowed right amang the hether! O my bonie, &amp;c. Now Hymen's beam gilds bank and stream Whar Will and I fresh flowers will gather; Nae storms I fear, I've got my dear Kind-hearted lad amang the hether! O my bonie Highland lad! My winsome, weel-far'd, Highland laddie! Should storms appear, my Will's ay near To row me in his tartan plaidie. COME UNDER MY PLAIDY; OR, MODERN MARRIAGE DELINEATED. Air—Johnie Macgill. ‘Come under my plaidy, the night's gau'n to fa'; Come in frae the cauld blast, the drift and the snaw; Come under my plaidy, and sit down beside me; There's room in't, dear lassie! believe me, for twa. Come under my plaidy, and sit down beside me, I'll hap ye frae every cauld blast that can blaw: O come under my plaidy, and sit down beside me, There's room in't, dear lassie! believe me, for twa.’ ‘Gae 'wa wi' your plaidy! auld Donald, gae 'wa, I fear na the cauld blast, the drift nor the snaw; Gae 'wa wi' your plaidy! I'll no sit beside ye; Ye may be my gutcher:—auld Donald, gae wa'. I'm gau'n to meet Johnie, he's young and he's bonie; He's been at Meg's bridal, sae trig and sae braw! O nane dances sae lightly! sae gracefu'! sae tightly! His cheek's like the new rose, his brow's like the snaw!’ ‘Dear Marion, let that flee stick fast to the wa', Your Jock's but a gowk, and has naithing ava; The hale o' his pack he has now on his back, He's thretty, and I am but threescore and twa. Be frank now and kindly; I'll busk you aye finely; To kirk or to market they'll few gang sae braw; A bein house to bide in, a chaise for to ride in, And flunkies to tend ye as aft as ye ca.’ ‘My father's ay tauld me, my mither and a', Ye'd make a gude husband, and keep me ay braw; It's true I loo Johnie, he's gude and he's bonie, But, waes me! ye ken he has naething ava! I hae little tocher; you've made a gude offer; I'm now mair than twenty; my time is but sma'! Sae gi' me your plaidy, I'll creep in beside ye, I thought ye'd been aulder than threescore and twa.’ She crap in ayont him, aside the stane wa', Whar Johnie was list'ning, and heard her tell a'; The day was appointed!—his proud heart it dunted, And strack 'gainst his side as if bursting in twa. He wandered hame weary, the night it was dreary! And thowless, he tint his gate deep 'mang the snaw; The howlet was screamin', while Johnie cried ‘Women Wa'd marry Auld Nick, if he'd keep them ay braw.’ O the deel's in the lasses! they gang now sae braw, They'll lie down wi' auld men o' fourscore and twa; The hale o'their marriage is gowd and a carriage; Plain luve is the cauldest blast now that can blaw! VALOUR SHIELDS THE BRAVE. Written during the prospect of an immediate invasion. The song represents the parting between a husband and wife on the first signal of the enemy's approach. Air—An old Gaelic tune. J. Hark!—hark! the sound of battle! Warning thrice, the cannons rattle!— Fast o'er plain and mountain brattle Scotia's thousands brave! A. Never!—never mair to tell When freedom fought!—where valour fell! Nor return! till death's sad knell Toll warriors to the grave! J. Awa wi' fear!—stop that tear! Freedom's cause to freemen's dear! Valour, Annie!—valour! valour! True valour shields the brave! A. What shields the helpless? Johnnie, Wha guards a wife like Annie? Trembling here, wi' infants bonnie! Sever'd frae the brave! Wha smiles to banish fear? Wha remains to stop the tear? J. Faithful love, and heaven's kind care, My Annie's peace will save! Then banish dread!—tear ne'er shed! Gallia's chains for slaves are made!— Britons, Annie!—Britons! Britons! Free Britons scorn the slave! A. Gang—gang! then, dearest Johnnie! Slavery's ill's the warst o'ony!— Heaven and virtue guard your Annie!— God direct the brave!— This warm kiss before you start! Place this token near your heart!— Friendship now and peace maun part, Dear freedom's cause to save! J. Then banish dread!—tear ne'er shed! If freedom fa's, love's joys drap dead! Freedom, Annie! Freedom! freedom! Blest freedom! or—the Grave! IV Wi' trembling hand, and heart sair knockin, Round his neck she tied love's token; Sighed, and cried, in words half spoken, Heaven shield the brave! The trumpet blew! the warrior flew; Met Scotia's freemen, dauntless, true! Firm their step! ranks red and blue, Cried, Victory, or the Grave! Then, Tyrant, dread! to conquest led Bands in freedom's armour clad!— Freedom! Tyrant!—Freedom! Freedom! Blest Freedom! shield the brave! THE AULD WIFE'S LAMENT—1804. Air—A rock, and a wee pickle tow. This warld o'ours has been lang in a low!— I wonder wha bred the beginning o't? God send us a rock, and a wee pickle tow! And let us again to the spinning o't! Our spinning, God help us! is no ganging right; Our men they're for fighting; our women tak fright; We're vap'ring a'day; and we're blind-fou at night: —But wha yet has heard o'the winning o't? They crack o'our trade; and they crack o'our walth; They brag o'our mills that are spinning o't; But, spite o'our boasting, and spite o'our pelf, Good faith! I hear few that are winning o't. Our wabsters are breaking, our looms they stand still! Our lads are doing little but tending the drill!— I doubt if e'en lairds now their pouches can fill— —Oh, hon! for the wearie beginning o't! They're plenty, nae doubt, wha can had their head heigh, And ay wad be thought to be winning o't; We're a'ganging fine; but we ay keep abeigh, When folk wad keek in at the spinning o't. Our houses are glittering; our lasses gang bra'! Our tables are costly—our pride's warst o'a'! But gin we gae on, we shall soon get a fa'! And then we'll hear nought but the tyning o't! Oh—oh! for the time when we sat at our wheel, And ilka ane sang to the spinning o't! A canty fire-side, and a cap o'good ale, Gaed ay sweetly down wi' the winning o't!— We're strutting!—we're blawing! morn, e'ening, and noon; We're wishing to see our French friends unco soon! But gif Bonaparte gangs on as he's done, We'll neither see end nor beginning o't! Yet think na, my lads, ye are yet to lye by!— Its ay right to try a beginning o't; Whan folk are sair put, they maun e'en ‘ride and tie;’ Its better than gi' up the spinning o't: Then up wi' your muskets, and up wi' your might! And up wi' your signals and fires on ilk height! If ance we get steddy, we yet may get right, And, ablins, ere lang prie the winning o't! THERE'S NOUGHT I SEE, TO FEAR NOW. Air—The king sits in Dumfermlin town. Our good king sits in Windsor tower, The sun-beams glint sae cheerfu'! A birdie sang in yonder bower, And O! but is sang fearfu'! Tell me, my bird, my mourning bird, What is't you sing so drearie? I sing o'danger, fire, and sword, Fell faes are coming near ye! The king stept on his terraced height, His heart was bauld and cheerie; “I fear no foe, by day or night, While Britain's sons are near me!” The bird ay sang upon the thorn, And ay its sang was fearfu'; Good king! your ships maun sail the morn, For England's faes are near you. The king looked frae his castle hie! His look was blythe and airy! “There's not a foe dares face the sea! Brave England's tars are there ay.” The birdie sang ay on the thorn, But now its sang grew cheerfu', Good king! we'll laugh your faes to scorn; There's nought I see to fear now! The birdie flew on blythesome wing, And O! but it sang rarely; And ay it sang, “God bless our King! Bauld Britons luve him dearly.” It flew o'er hill, it flew o'er lea, It sang o'er moor and hether, Till it came to the north countrie, Whar a'sang blythe thegither. They sang o'fame and martial might, (The pride o'Scottish story) The sang o'Edward's wars and flight, And Bruce's radiant glory! They laughed at Gallia's threat'ning ills— (Their shield was Patriot-honour;) They rushed down Freedom's heath-flowered hills, And, rattling, joined her banner! THE SCOTTISH MUSE. JAMAICA, 1798. Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song, That old and antique song we heard last night: Methought it did relieve my passion much; More than light airs, and recollected terms Of these more brisk and giddy-paced times.— Shakespeare. O welcome, simply soothing treasure! In midst o'pain my lanely pleasure! Tutored by thee, and whispering leisure, I quit the thrang, And, wrapt in blessed retirement, measure Thy varied sang! Kind, leil companion! without thee, Ah, welladay! what should I be The author's complaints were such, that, unable either to read or to write above a few minutes without distress, his only amusement was to compose by the help of memory alone. It may, perhaps, be worth mentioning, that Will and Jean, the Waes o'War, the Links o'Forth, and the present poem, were all composed by memory, previously to the commitment of a single line to paper.! Whan jeered by fools wha canna see My inward pain, Aneath thy sheltering wing I flee, And mak my mane. There seated, smiling by my side, For hours thegither wilt thou bide, Chanting auld tales o'martial pride, And luve's sweet smart! Till glowing warm thy numbers glide Streight to the heart. 'Tis then, wi' powerfu' plastic hand Thou wavest thy magic-working wand; And stirring up ideas grand That fire the brain, Aff whirlst me swift to fairy land 'Mang Fancy's train.— Scar'd by disease whan balmy rest Flees trembling frae her downy nest; Starting frae horror's dreams opprest, I see thee come Wi' radiance mild that cheers the breast, And lights the gloom! Heart'ning thou com'st, wi' modest grace, Hope, luve, and pity, in thy face, And gliding up wi' silent pace My plaints to hear, Whisper'st in turn thae soothing lays Saft in my ear. ‘Ill-fated wand'rer! doomed to mane! Wan suff'rer bleached wi' care and pain! How changed, alas! since vogie vain, Wi' spirits light, Ye hailed me first in untaught strain On Strevlin's height! ‘—Ah me! how stark! how blithe! how bauld Ye brattled then through wind and cauld! Reckless, by stream, by firth and fauld Ye held your way; By passion ruled; by love enthralled, Ye poured the lay. ‘'Twas then, entranced in am'rous sang, I marked you midst the rural thrang; Ardent and keen, the hail day lang Wi' Nature ta'en, Slip frae the crowd, and mix amang Her simple train. ‘'Twas then I saw (alas! owre clear!) Your future thriftless, lost career! And while some blamed, wi' boding fear, The tunefu' art, Your moral pride and truth sincere Aye wan my heart. ‘He ne'er can lout, I musing said, To ply the fleeching, fawning trade; Nor bend the knee, nor bow the head To walth or power! But backward turn, wi' scornfu' speed, Frae flatt'ry's door. ‘He'll never learn his bark to steer 'Mid passion's sudden, wild career; Nor try at times to tack or veer To int'rest's gale, But hoist the sheet, unawed by fear, Tho' storms prevail. ‘Owre proud to ask;—owre bauld to yield!

But than—waes me! there comes a time O'dool and care! ‘There comes a time!—or soon, or late, O'serious thought and sad debate; Whan blighted hope and adverse fate Owrespread their gloom, And mirk despair, in waefu' state, Foresees the doom! ‘—And maun he fa'!

Year after year hope's phantoms fly; Year after year life's pleasures die; To-day we smile; to-morrow sigh;— In vain we moan! Yet still I mourn, and, moaning, cry, “My Currie's gone!” He's gone!—but yet, tho' lost, the blaze That waked sae late admiring praise, Its parting beam's reflected rays In colours rise, Bright as warm summer's sun displays In evening' skies! And these will last, and saft diffuse Their charms to sooth the Scottish Muse; And while she sheds affection's dews At Friendship's shrine, A heaven-shot gleam in bright'ning hues Through clouds will shine.</field>
