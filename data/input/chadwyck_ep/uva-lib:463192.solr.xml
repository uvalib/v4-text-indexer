      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, IOHN Archbishop of Canterburie, Primat and Metropolitane of England, A. F. wisheth abundant increase of all heauenly and spirituall blessings. The fyrst Eclog of Virgill, intituled: Tityrus. The Argument. Melibey a Shepherd, and familiar freend of Tityrus, (in the person of all the Mantuans) being forced to forsake his lands and possessions in Mantua, tooke his flight through a peece of ground, where he found Tityrus, and heard him vnder a beech tree pleasantly piping a song of his sweete hart Amaryll, and therevpon spake vnto him, saying. O Tityrus, &amp;c. Nowe you must suppose that Melibey had on a Shepherds cote, which he had priuilie gotten away to disguise himselfe in flight, draging after him a sillye Gote, with his one hand, and holding his shepherds staffe in the other, hauing also vpon his necke and shoulders, a little fardle or trusse, and so droue his flocke of Gotes before him. The speakers are Melibey and Tityrus: Melibey representing a Citizen or townseman of Mantua, and Tityrus the person of Uirgill. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text. Major characters' names have been abbreviated as follows: For Me. read Melibey; For Ti. read Tityrus. Melibey. O Tityrus thou lieng vnder shade of spreading beech, Doost play a countrie song vpon a slender oten pipe, We do forsake our countrie bounds, &amp; medowes sweet [which be] We doo forsake our natiue soile, thou Tityr slug in shade Doost teach the woods to sound so shrill, thy loue faire Amaryll. Ti. O Melibey [our] god hath wrought this quietnesse for vs, For he shall euer be my god, his altars oftentimes A tender lambe out of my folds shall colour and imbrue, He suffered my sheepe to stray [and feed] as thou doost see, And eeke my selfe on countrie pipe to play what songs I would. Me. I doo not grudge at this thy good, but rather woonder I, That troubles so exceeding great, feelds ouer euery where Yet see my selfe a sickly man, doo driue my gotes aloofe, O Tityrus this gote also scarse doo I leade or guide: For but a while ago euen heere, among the hazels thicke, Foorth hauing brought with mickle paine, hir twins [a he and shee] My hope of flocke, vpon a flint bare shee [alacke] them left, I doo remember well the okes, from heauen which were toucht, Foretold vs [many a time] and oft, of this foule euill lucke, If that our mind vntoward [stand starke foolish] had not beene, Oftimes the crow from hollow holme foretold vnhappy newes, But yet what god this is giue vs O Tityr t'vnderstand. Tit. O Melibey I foolish man, thought that the citie, which They do call Rome, was like to this of ours, whereto full oft We shepheards vse to driue the ten-der weanlings of our sheepe, I know also that puppies yoong are like their bitch [or dam] And kids to gotes, so great with small I vsed to compare. But this did lift hir head so high among all other townes, As cipres trees are woont among the oziers apt to bend. Mel. And what so great occasion was, to thee of seeing Rome? Tit. Euen libertie which late did looke vpon me slouenlike, But fairer now my beard is falne, with pouling it away. Yet libertie hath lookt on me, and after long is come, Euen after Amaryllis hath and Galath left vs quite, For (I will now confesse the truth) whiles Galath did possesse me, Ne hope was there of liberty, ne care of cattell mine, Though many a sacrifice did go out of my sheepcotes then, And good fat cheeses prest and made for that vnthankfull towne, Yet neuer full of mony came my right hand backward home. Mel. O Amaryll I woondred why thou sad on gods wouldst call, For whom thou suffer wouldst thy frute vpon their tree to hang, From hence was Tityrus away, O Tityrus the pines, The water-springs and these same groues did call thee by thy name. Tit. What should I do? bicause I may not out of seruice go, Nor any where [but here in Rome] such present gods to know? O Melibey here I haue seene [Cæsar] that proper youth, For whom our altars yerely smoke twise six daies euery month, He first gaue answer here to me then humbly making sute, O youths your oxen feed as erst, your buls put vnder yoke. Mel. O luckie old man therfore thy lands shal whole remain to thee, And large enough, albeit that bare stones and fennie flouds Do ouerlay the pastures all with muddy rush and sedge, Unwoonted feeding shall not taint thy cattell great with yoong, Nor ill disease of neighbours beasts, shall do hurt vnto thine, O luckie old man thou oft shalt take the fresh and shadie cold, Euen here among the riuers knowne and holy water springs, On this side shall thy sense or hedge next by thy neighbours bounds, Thy hedge of willow trees whose floure are eat of Hybla bees, Shall oft with gentle sound of them persuade thee fall asleepe, On th' other side the treelopper from vnder mountaine high Shall chaunt and sing with voice alowd [persing the aiery skie] Yet in the meane time ringdoues hoarse, thy care [and great delight] Ne turtle doue shall ceasse to moorne from loftie tree of elme. Tit. Therfore the stags so light [of foot like birds] shal feed in th' aire, The seas shall faile, and fishes leaue all bare vpon the shore, The Parthian pilgrime first shall drinke of Arax riuer cleere, Or one of Germanie shall drinke of Tigris flowing streames, (The bounds of both gone round about) [and passed far and neere] Before his face and countenance shall slip out of my brest. Mel. But we will hense depart some to the thirstie Africans, Part of vs into Scithia [by trauelling] will come, And to Oaxis rough of Creet [a riuer passing swift] And to the Brittans parted from the vniuersall world. Lo on a day I beholding of my natiue countrie bounds, Long time hereafter seeing too some summers ouerpast, The couering of my cottage poore all made and thatcht with turfe, [Which cottage was] my kingdome, shall I woonder at the same? Shall wicked soldiors haue and hold these fallow fields so trimd? And strangers reape this crop of mine; alacke behold whereto Discord hath brought [and drawne by force] our wofull citizens; See now for whome our fields we haue [with seed in seedtime] sowne, O Melibey now pearetress graft, and vines in order set, And go my gotes, erst happie beasts, to places go vnknowne, I being laid along vpon a vallie fresh and greene Hereafter shall not see you hang vpon the bushie banks, I will not sing songs any more, nor you my little gotes, Shall neuer crop the blooming shrub, and bitter willow trees I feeding you [or all the while that I prouide you food.] Tit. Howbeit here thou maist thee rest with me this [present] night, Upon greene leaues [in grassie ground] ripe apples [some] we haue, Soft chestnuts, and of creame and curds [for cheese] we haue good store, And now the highest tops of farms far off do cast a smoke, And greater shadowes [than before] from mountains high do fall. The second Eclog of Virgill, intituled, Corydon. The Argument. Corydon a shepheard vnreasonably in loue with a passing faire youth named Alexis, and seeking him vp and downe in waylesse woods and places void of passage, rehearseth all things which might or could obtaine loue and liking; wherewithall when he saw he could doo no good, nor any whit preuaile, at length he falleth to persuasion, giuing counsell and aduise to keepe a measure in loue, least it grow into foolish outrage. By Alexis is ment a youth named Alexander, and by Corydon is vnderstood Virgill. The shepherd Corydon loued sore Alexis faire [that youth] His lords delight, and yet he had not that which he did hope, He [came] full oft the beeches thicke vnto with shadie tops, There all alone he cast vnto the mounteins and the woods These words rude and disordered [with labour spent in vaine,] O cruell Alex for my songs thou doost not care [a straw] Of vs thou doost no pitie take, yea more, thou mak'st me die, How do the cattell also take the shadowes and the coole, Now doo the thornie thickets hide the lizzards greene also, And Thestylis [that woman] stamps wilde thyme and garlike too, Strong smelling herbs, for mowers [meat] wearied in scortching sunne. But yet the groues doo sound againe with grashops hoarse and mee, Whilest I go all about to seeke the treddings of thy feet, In hot and burning sunne [alacke:] had it not better beene T'auoid the heauie anger and the proud disdaine and spite Of Amaryll [that wench?] and had it not far better beene T'abide Menalca, blacke though he and [louely] white were she? O faire welfauoured youth, trust not too much thy gallant hew White priuet [flowers] fall [to the ground] blacke violets gathered vp, O Alex I am scornd of thee, ne ask'st thou what I am, How rich in cattell white as snow, how greatly stord with milke, A thousand lambs of mine doo stray vpon Sicilia hilles, New milke in summer failes me not, ne yet in winter [time] I sing [the songs] that Amphron Dircey was woont [to sing] Upon the hyll of Aracynth butting vpon the shore, If any time he cald his heard [and cattell him about:] Ne am I so ill fauoured, I saw my selfe of late Standing on shore, when as the sea stood calme and still from winds, I will not feare Daphnis [that man] thou being iudge [betweene] If so be that my counterfet doo neuer me deceiue, O that thou wouldest dwell with me in sluttish countrie soile, In cottages both low and small, and sticke the stags with darts, And driue the flocke of kids to mallows and to rushes greene, Thou shalt resemble Pan in sing-ing in the woods with me, Pan first deuised to ioyne with wax, pipes many a one together, Pan cares for sheepe and [shepheards too] of sheepe [which] maisters [be,] Ne let it thee repent with pipe thy little lip t'haue worne, What thing did not Amyntas doo that he this same might know? A pipe made vp of seuen reeds, and diuerse all in sound, I haue, which Damet once bestowd vpon me for a gift, And dieng said, This pipe hath thee, next owner of the same. Thus said Dameta, howbeit Amyntas [busie] foole, Did enuie me therefore. Beside two little gotes were found Of me in vallie dangerous, their skins with speckled white, Two teats of sheepe they drie adaie [with sucking,] which I keepe For thee: [yet] Thestylis desirde me long ago that she Might haue them hense, and so she will, because thou scornst our gifts, O faire well fauoured youth come heere, behold the nymphs doo bring Lillies for thee by baskets full, white Nais [the nymph also] Cropping for thee pale violets, and poppie floures likewise Dooth ioine the floure delice and floure of fennell sauouring well, And making [garlands] also of sweet Casia, and other Most sweet and pleasant hearbs, she decks blacke violets soft [of leafe] With yellow floures of marigold [which followeth the sunne.] My selfe will gather peaches gray, with tender cotton [cotes] And chestnuts too, which Amaryll [my sweet hart] loued well, And I will put plums [vnto these] plums red and soft as wax, And honor also to this plum [or apple] shall be [doone] And you O baytrees I will crop, and hirtle berrie trees, So set and placed for bicause sweet sauours you doo mingle. O Corydon thou art a clowne, Alex regards no gifts, Ne if by gifts thou striue and straine, may Iol giue thee place. Alacke what might I [doo] vnto my selfe poore sillie man? Lost and vndone; I haue let in southwinds among the floures, And bores into the watrie springs [my pleasures I haue spoild.] Ah mad-head; from whom fliest thou? the gods haue dwelt in woods, And Paris too king Dardans sonne. What castles, forts and townes Pallas hath built, in them let hir inhabit [keepe and dwell] Aboue all other places let the woods content vs best. The sterne and lowring lion she dooth follow [in chase] the woolfe, The woolfe dooth follow [in chase] the gote, the wanton gote likewise Doth couet after cythisus that blooming shrub [for life] And O Alexis after thee poore Corydon doth hunt, Their owne [peculiar] pleasure drawes [and conquers] euery men. Behold the bullocks home doo beare their plowes hangd on the yoke, The sunne also in going downe th' increasing shades doth double, Yet loue torments me still, what mea-sure can there be for loue? Ah Corydon ah Corydon what madnesse hath thee caught? Thou hast a vine halfe cut and lopt [growing] vpon an elme All full of leaues; Why doost thou not yet rather now at last Settle thy selfe some thing to make, which needfull is to vse, [Some wicker worke] of iuie rods, or else of rushes soft? Thou shalt find out another if this Alex thee disdaine. The third Eclog of Virgill, intituled: Palæmon.Speakers' names in this text have been abbreviated. Major speakers' names are abbreviated as follows: For Me. read Menalcas; For Da. read Dametas. The Argument. The third eclog, with the fourth and fift following are for the most part taken out of Theocritus, and concerneth Dametas and Menalcas two shepheards very cunning in song and pipe. First therefore these two being at ods one with another, and striuing for excellencie, fall to reprochfull speeches and euill words: afterward their skill commeth in triall vpon wagers laid to and fro, both of them keeping course, number, and time. Last of all, when they haue shewed what they can, Palæmon sits in seat as iudge of the matter, and giuing equall praise vnto them both, as wel matched, he knitteth vp this eclog, with a warning not onely to these shepheards, but to all others to beware of loue, and to auoid it as much as may be. The speakers are Menalcas and Dametas, challenger and defendant, the iudge of the match is Palæmon. Menalcas. O Damet, tell, whose beasts be these, are they Melibs or no? Da. Not his, but Ægons, Ægon gaue them me of late [to keepe.] Me. O sheepe alwaies vnluckie beasts, while he [Ægon I meane] Doth loue and cherish Nerea, and feareth least that she Should more esteeme of me than him. This Damet, who indeed Is shepheard to another man, milks sheepe twise in an houre, And so from sheepe their iuice, from lambs their milke is drawne away. Da. O Menalc yet remember that these faults are to be laid Unto mens charge more sparingly: we also know who had [To do with thee] thine eies then loo-king wantonly awrie, And in what chapell too, but yet the gentle nymps did laugh. Me. Then I beleeue [when as they saw] me cut the wood or groue Of Micon, and his newgrowne vines with naughtie [hedging] bill. Da. Or else the nymphs [did laugh] euen here hard by their beeches old When thou didst breake the bow and shafts of Daphnis, which when as Thou froward Menalc sawest giuen the youth, thou diddest grudge, And if thou hadst not hurt him too some way thou wouldst haue dide. Me. What shal the lords [or owners] do when theeues dare [play such pranks] O naughtie fellow, saw not I thee take in snares [by stelth] A gote of Damons [at what time] the bandog barked much, And when I cald aloud to thee, Ho whether trudgeth he? O Tityr gather vp thy beasts: thou lurkedst in the sedge. Da. Should not that fellow Damon o-uercome of me in play, Haue giuen me the gote, the which my pipe deseru'd with songs? And if thou canst not tell [so much] that gote is [cleere] mine owne, And Damon so confest himselfe; but said he could not giue it. Me. Didst thou in singing [conquer] him, or hadst at any time, Whistle or pipe ioind close with wax, and woonted wast not thou, Unskilfull [foole] in common waies to lauish sillie songs Upon a pipe all out of tune [making an irkesome noise?] Da. Wilt thou therfore betweene vs twaine, that we by trial prooue By turnes what both of vs can do; this cow (least thou perhaps Shouldst it refuse, coms twise a day vnto the milking pale, And with hir vdders nourisheth and feeds two calues at once) This cow Ile lay: now tell me for what wager thou wouldst striue? Me. Of this my flocke I dare not I lay any thing with thee. For I a father and a curst stepmother haue at home, They both do count twise in a day the cattell [euery chone] And one of them doth tell the kids: howbeit I will lay That which to be much greater thou thy selfe shalt [now] confesse, (Bicause it is thy pleasure to be mad) [that is to say] These drinking pots of beech which are the grauen workmanship Of excellent Alcymedon, vpon which pots being made With easie [cutting] grauing toole, a limber winding vine Doth cloth and decke the berries growne and spreaded here and there With whitish iuie leaues; and in the middle of these pots Two images [are grauen] Co-non one and who the other? Euen he that with his rod set foorth to nations all the world, What times the reaper and the croo-ked plowman [too] should haue Unto those pots I haue not yet [so much] as laid my lips, But do preserue and keepe them [in a corner] hidden close. Da. The same Alcymedon hath made two pots also for vs, And compassed about the eares with tender beare claw [leaues] And hath set Orphey in the midst, and following him the woods, Unto those pots I haue not yet [so much as] laid my lips, But do preserue and keepe them [in a corner] hidden close. If thou wouldst looke vpon my cow, ther's naught my pots to praise. Men. Thou shalt not scape to day, Ile come whersoeuer thou wilt call, And I will bring to passe that thou hereafter with thy voice Shalt not prouoke [or challenge a-ny man [as thou hast me] And let Palæmon only heare these songs, lo where he coms. Da. Go to then, if thou hast [or canst sing any thing at all,] In me there shall be no delay, ne will I shrinke or start Aside for any man [not I] Palæmon neighbour mine, Only lay vp in iudgement deepe this strife, the thing's not small. Pal. Say then [and sing] sith we are sat vpon the grasse so soft, Now euery field and euery tree beginneth frute to beare, Now woods beare leaues, and now the yeare is in his brauest hew, Begin Dameta, Menalc thou shalt follow afterwards, By turns you both shall sing, the nymphs loue songs that go by turnes. Da. O muses, at god Iupiter let our beginning be, All things are full replenished with great god Iupiter, He loueth and preserues the earth, he careth for my songs. Me. And god Apollo loueth me, for whom I alwaies haue His gifts, bay [boughs] and lillies red, both which do sweetly smell. Da. The wanton wench Galath both cast an apple oft at me, And runs vnto the willowes, and would first full faine be seene. Me. But my loue sweet Amyntas coms to me of his owne will, So that Diana is not now more knowne vnto our dogs. Da. Gifts gotten are for Venus mine, for I haue markt the place, Wherein the doues of th'aire haue ga-thred [stuffe to build their neasts.] Me. I haue sent to my youth ten yel-low apples like to gold, (As many as I could) puld from a tree in woods [so wild,] Ten other apples vnto him to morrow I will send. Da. O what [sweet words] how oft also spake Galath vnto vs? O winds beare you some part of them to th' eares of gods [aboue.] Me. O my Amynt what profits it, that thou in hart and mind Doost not despise and set me light, if I the nets do keepe, While thou doost follow [huntmanlike in chase the brislie] bore? Da. O Iöl send me Phyllis, for now is my byrth day come, Wherein Ile sacrifice for corne, and come [Iöl] thy selfe. Me. Phyllis I loue afore all else, for she wept at my going, And said farewell faire youth, a long time Iöl O farewell. Da. The woolfe a sad and heauie thing is vnto cattell stald, And showrs of raine [a heauie thing] to frutes [in season] ripe, And winds to trees, and vnto vs the wrath of Amaryll. Me. The moistning raine is sweet to fields when they be [newlie] sowne, The shoots of vines are sweet to kids [from sucking] put away, So is the limber willow tree to cattell great with yoong, [But sweet and pleasant] vnto me Amyntas is alone. Da. Pollio dooth loue our song, although it be a countrie one, [And therefore] O Pierides, [you muses] feed a cow For Pollio your reader, and to sacrifice it him. Me. Pollio himselfe dooth also make songs that be new and strange, O feed a bull for Pollio, which with his horns can butt, And with his feet can fling and scat-ter all about the sand. Da. O Pollio who so loueth thee, let that man thither come, Whether he doth reioice that thou thy selfe art also come, Let honie flow, and thornie bush beare deintie grapes for him. Me. O Meni who so hates not Baue, let that man loue thy songs, And let him couple foxes too, and milch the male-kind gotes. Da. O prettie boies which gather floures and strawberries also, Creeping or growing on the ground, hence get you fast away, For in the grasse doth lurke a snake [whose poison is full] cold. Me. O sheepe forbeare and spare to go too forwards on the way, It is not good to trust the bankes: [for why] the ram himselfe Dooth drie his flesh [bicause he fell into the water wet.] Da. O Tityr driue thy little gotes from [treading neere] the streame, My selfe when time shall serue will wash them all in running spring. Me. O you my lads take vp the sheepe and put them in the fold, [For] if the heat shall ouertake their milke as late it did, In vaine we shal with palms of hands presse oft and wring their teat. Da. Alacke how leane a bull haue I in pasture fat and ranke, The selfe same loue is deadlie dole to sheepe and sheapheard too. Me. Loue truly is no cause in mine, scarce cleaues their flesh to bones, I wot not I what [euell] ey dooth witch my tender lambs? Da. O Menalc tell me in what ground, a space of heauen appeeres. Three elues, no more, and thou shalt be Apollo great to mee. Me. O Damet tell me in what ground those flours doo spring and grow, Wherein are written names of kings, and Phyllis take alone. Pal. It is not in vs for to end betweene you strifes so great, Both thou Menalc [by due desert] art worthy of the cow, And this Dameta too, and whosoeuer else beesids, Shall feare sweet loue, or prooue and trie the same bitter to be, Now youths shut vp the sluses close, the medes haue droonke enough. The fourth Eclog of Virgill intituled Pollio, or the birth day of Soloninus. The Argument. Asinius Pollio, an excellent orator and captaine of the Germane host vnder Augustus, after his taking of the citie Salonæ in Dalmatia, hauing triumphed, he was aduanced to the office of a consull. Not long after this, he begat a sonne, whom he named Salonius, in memorie of the citie Salonæ, which he had conquered and taken. For this yoong babes sake newly borne, as also (and that principallie) to please the father, who was in great fauour, and might doo much with Augustus, Virgill (whom Pollio greatly esteemed, releeued and maintained) in this eclog describeth the birth day of the said Salonius. Wherein this is to bee marked, that such thinges as the prophetesse Sybilla of Cuma foretold of the comming and birth of Christ (as Lactantius, Eusebus, &amp; Augustine doo testifie) the poet vtterly ignorant of that diuinitie, applieth to the happinesse of Augustus his gouernment, and also to the child Salonine. And because this eclog, as likewise two more, are of somwhat a loftier stile than beseemeth the argument of a pastorall deuise, the poet beginneth very modestly with an honest confession or preface, as followeth. In this eclog the poet speaketh alone. O muses of Sicilia ile let's greater matters sing, Shrubs [groues] and bushes lowe delight and please not euery man, If we doo sing of woods, the woods be worthy of a consull, Now is the last age come whereof Sibyllas verse foretold, And now the virgin come againe, and saturnes kingdome come, Now is [a sonne] an ofspring new sent downe from heauen high, O chast Lucina fauour thou the boy that's now in birth, By whom the yron nation first shall cease and haue an end, And ouer all the world this golden age shall rise [and spring] O Pollio truly of this age the beauties and the hew, Shall [then] begin [when] thou art con-sull and the moneths great Shall [then] begin [forward to go and orderly] proceed, I my marke or notes of our offense doo yet remaine, The same made void deliuer shall, the earth from endlesse feare Thou being guide and gouernor he [Cæsar I doo meane] Shall take his life of gods [aboue] and also he shall see Most noble states with heauenly gods mingled [in companie,] Aad he likewise himselfe shalbe of them beheld and seene, And shall with fathers vertues rule the world in quiet set: O child the ground shall yeeld to thee hir first fruits, little gifts, No dressing [thereupon bestowd] in places euery where, Euen yuie spreding of itselfe with [gentle] lady flowre, And beanes of Æygipt mingled with that plesant beatefoot herbe, The little gotes themselues shall beare home to their [maisters house] Their dugs stuft full of milke, the herds [of cattell] shall not feare The lions great aud terrible, the very cradle too [Wherein the infant lies] shall yeeld faire louelie floure to thee, The serpent perrish shall and dy, the herbe of poison too [Which is] deceptfull, it shall die [and withering fall away] And deintie grapes of Syria shall very common grow, But herewithall when as thou shalt the fame and praises read Of noble men, and therewithall thy fathers acts and deeds, And shall perceiue and vnderstand what [heauenlie] vertue is, Then shall the feeld wax yellowish by little and by little, With soft and tender eares of corne, and ruddie grapes shall hang On thorne vntrimd [and wilde] hard okes shall sweat honny like deaw: But yet of old deceipt and guile a few marks shall remaine, Which may commaund to try the sea with ships, and compasse townes With walles, and cut in furrowes deepe into the ground [with plow] Another Typhis then shall liue, another Argus too, Which may conuey and carry cho-sen men of noble race, Then also other warres shalbe, and once againe to Troy, Achilles great and valiant shalbe [set out] and sent, Then hereupon soone after that thy [yeares] and settled age, Hath made thee be a matt, the mer-chant he shall leaue the sea, The ship of pine tree shall not change hir merchandize [and wares,] All kind of ground all kind of things shall [carrie yeeld and] beare, The earth shall bide no rake, the vine no hedgebill shall abide, The plowman now shall loose the yokes from strong and sturdy buls, The wooll shall learne to counterfeit colours of diuers kinds, But in the medowes shall the ram his woollen fleeses change, Now into purple sweetly red, now yellow saffron hew: A colour bright and flaming red shall of it owne accord Cloth [and adorne] the lambs feeding a fee-ding in the [pasture] field. The fatall ladies all agree-ing in the stedfast law And mightie power of destinie said to their spindels [thus,] Run on such seasons [golden times and happie ages still] O deere ofspring and child of gods, O great increase of Ioue, Great honours vndertake, the time [ordaind] will shortly be, Behold the world now staggering with burthen crooked bent, The land, the coasts of sea, the heauen profound and passing high, Behold how all things ioy at this same [golden] time to come. O that the last part of my life might last so long to me, My breath also, as might suffice to tell thine acts and deeds, Not Orph of Thrace should passe me then in [sweet melodious] songs, Nor Linus neither, though the mother of the one were by, And th' others father present too, Calliope the muse Is Orpheus mother, and of Line Apollo [father] faire. Though Pan should striue with me [in song] Arcadia being iudge, Euen Pan would say hee's ouercome, Arcadia being iudge, O little boie begin to know thy mother by thy laughing, Ten months brought vnto mother thine both long and tedious toiles, O little boy begin [to know thy mother by thy laughing] At whom thy parents laughed not [when thou wast but a babe] Ne god thought worthie of his boord, ne goddesse of hir bed. The fift Eclog intituled: Daphnis.Speakers' names in this text have been abbreviated. They are as follows: For Me. read Menalcas; For Mo. read Mopsus. The Argument. Two shepheards, both freends, and the one elder, the other yonger, are presented vnto vs in this eclog singing avy, or in course and turnes, wherevpon the poet taketh occasion to write an epitaph or funerall verse, which doth wholy comprise an allegoricall meaning, and is to be vnderstood either of Iulius Cæsar a little before the making hereof slaine in the parliament house, or of his cousine Quintilius (as Seruius supposeth) whose death he lam?ted vnmesurably: of which matter ther is a gall?t verse in the first book of Horace his Odes. Some imagine that these things are meant of his brother Flaccus, whose vntimely death he bemoneth vnder the name of Daphnis. Notwithstanding all this, be as be may, the whole argument and drift of the epitaph dooth sufficient shew that all these thinges are to be vnderstood of Cæsar. The speakers are Menalcas and Mopsus, the second giuing place to the first as to his elder, and yet both well acquainted and friends. Menalcas. O Mops because together we are met, both being good, Thou for to whistle on thy pipe, and I light songs to sing, Why do we not sit downe toge-ther here among the elms, Mingled with hazels; [by their shade to saue vs from the sun.] Mo. O Menalc thou mine elder art, and therefore meet it is That I obey thee, whether we do go into the shades Uncerteine, when the westerne winds do moue [and blow] Or rather go into a caue, behold the vinetree wild How it hath ouerspread the caue with branches [growing] thin. Me. Let Amynt all alone striue with thee in [these] hils of ours, Mo. What if the same [Amynt] should striue to conquer Phebe in singing? Me. Begin thou first ô Mops to sing if thou haue any loue Of Phyllis, or haue Alcons praise, or Codrus [angrie] bralles, Begin, for Tityr he will keepe [and tend] thy feeding kids. Mo. Nay rather I will trie to sing the songs, which lately I Wrote on the greene barke of a beech, and singing tunably, Hauing noted them by course; bid Amynt striue [sing] after me. Me. As much as limber willow tree giues place to oliue pale, As much as spike low [by the ground] giues place to rosiers red: So much (in our opinion) giues Amynt place to thee, But sirra ceasse [more words to say] she are come to the caue. Mop. The nymphs did mourne and moue Daphnis by cruell death y'slaine, O hazell trees and riuers too, the nymphs you witnesse bee, When as his mother did imbrace his sonnes most wofull corps, She cald the gods [most cruell] and the stars she cruell cald; O Daphnis shepheards none did driue their bullocks [grazd and] fed Unto the riuers coole in those daies, no fourefooted beast Did tast the watersprings, ne toucht one blade or leafe of grasse; O Daphnis all the mounteins wild and woods report and say That euen the Lions of Africa lamented at thy death. Daphnis deuised first to ioine together in a coch, The tigres of Armenia, and Daphnis [first deuisd] To wind and bind the limber speares about with softish leaues. As to the trees the vine is [all] the honour and the praise, As to the vine the grapes, as to the flocke the [sturdie] buls, As to the fat [and rankest] fields the [ripened] standing corne; So thou to thine the honor art now after thou art dead. Pales hir selfe hath left the field, Apollo too hath left them, Unluckie tares and barren otes beare sway in plowed lands, Wherein we oftentimes cast bar-lie [seed corne] great and large, In steed of violets soft and lil-lies red rise vp [and grow] Thistle and shrub [beset about] with sharpe and pricking thorns. O shepherds scatter you the ground with leaues, and shadowes bring To and vpon the water springs [make groues about the same] Daphnis commands such things be done for him [vnto his praise;] And make a toome, and on the toome this verse [of memory] set: Daphnis I am, knowne in the woods from hence vnto the stars, Of cattell faire a keeper, yet fairer [than they] my selfe. Me. O heauenly poet this thy song is euen such to vs, As to the weary quiet sleepe, vpon the grasse [so greene] As in a heat and drought to quench ones thirst with springing streames Of water sweet, thou doost not on-ly match thy maister iumpe In piping, but in singing too. O Mops thou luckie youth, Thou shalt be now the next to him [the second man I meane] Howbeit we will sing our songs in some sort [as we may] By course againe to thee, and will lift vp vnto the stars Daphnis thy deere, Daphnis we will lift vp vnto the stars: Daphnis [made very much of vs, and] likewise loued vs. Mop. Can any thing more deerer be to vs than such a gift? The youth himselfe [euen Dapnis sweet] was woorthy to be soong, And Stimicon a while ago did praise these songs to vs. Me. White Daphnis woondreth at the light vnwoonted of Olympus, And vnderfoot doth see the clouds and stars that shine beneath, And therefore pleasure doth possesse the glad and ioyfull woods, And other countrie grounds beside, and Pan and shepheards too, And those same gyrles the Dryades [which keepe among the okes.] The woolfe deuiseth not ne thinks on snares for sillie beasts, Ne trains and nets deuise deceit for [stags and running] harts, Good Daphnis loueth quietnesse [he loueth rest and peace:] The hils vnshorne lift vp for ioy their voices to the stars, The rocks themselues, the very groues [for ioy] sound out their songs, A god is Daphnis [doubtlesse] he O Menalc is a god. O Daphnis O be good and kind and gratious vnto thine; Behold foure altars, two for thee O Daphnis, and for Phebe Two other altars. I will dresse and readie make for thee Yerely two pots both foming [full] of new milke [to the brim,] And two kans full of good fat oile; and being merry I Will make thee bankets first of all, with much wine [thervnto,] Before the fire if it be cold, if hot then in the shade, And I will poure out quaffing cups of malmsey wines [which are] New [strange and passing pleasant drinks] like ippocrasse in tast. Damet and Ægon he of Creet shall sing songs vnto me, Alphesibey shall counterfeit the dansing satyrs too; These [duties] euer shalbe done to thee [for honors sake:] And when we shall restore and pay the nymphs our woonted vowes, And when we shall deuoutly view and go about the feelds, Whiles bore shall loue the tops of hils, or fish the riuers [streames] Whiles bees shall feed of thyme and grashoppers of [heauenly] deaw, Thy honor, name, and praises shall for euermore remaine: To thee shall husbandmen [and all that dwell in countrie soile] Make vowes, as vnto Bacchus and to Ceres [they do vse] And thou shalt charge them with their vowes [in binding them to pay.] Mop. What gifts, what gifts for such a song shall I bestow on thee? For neither doth the blast of sow-therne wind when as it coms, Nor watershores and banks [bedasht] and beaten with the flouds, Nor streames which downward run among the vallies full of stones, So much delight and please me [as the song which thou hast soong.] Me. We will bestow vpon thee first this brittle pipe; this pipe Taught vs, the shepheard Corydon did loue Alexis faire, The same taught vs, whose beasts be these, are they Melibs or no? Mo. But Menalc take thou here my shep-heards staffe, which Antigen When oft he vrgde the same of me, yet had it not away, (And yet at that time Antigen was worthie to be loued) My trim faire staffe with euen knots and [shepheards] hooke of brasse. The sixt Eclog conteineth a sonnet or song of Silenus, by whom is meant the poet Virgill himselfe. The Argument. As elsewhere before, so here also the poet confesseth that hee swarueth from the simplicitie and plainenesse of Theocritus, whome in very many things he followeth, adding a certaine excuse of his owne dooings and times, wherein the plainenesse of Theocritus could not euery wher be shewed, no though he did neuer so temper his stile and frame his phrase, as of high matters, as much as might be possible, not to speake otherwise than in certaine rurall and pastorall allegories. Touching the argument it selfe, you must note, that as in the fourth eclog the poet aduanced Pollio and his sonne: so in this eclog writing to Varus he promiseth to declare his praises: and because he was an Epicure (as Seruius saith) therefore it is thought that in this eclog the sect of Epicures is expressed. For as they placed the souereigne or cheefest good in voluptuousnesse and pleasure, which is principally occupied in tasting and feeling: so the poet bringeth in Silenus drunke and drowzie, the Satyrs lecherous and wanton, vnto whome he ioyneth a faire nymph, ladie of this eclog. So that in Silenus we haue the portraiture of drunkennesse &amp; drowzinesse, and in the others the representation of Venerie and fleshlie pleasures. The remnant concerning the originals of all things, as also of the beginning of the world are borrowed &amp; fetcht from the opinion of Epicure which he receiued and tooke of Democritus. The onely speaker in this eclog is the poet himselfe. Our muse Thalia first of all vouchsafed hath to play In verse of Siracuse and hath not blusht to dwell in woods: When as I sang of kings and wars, Apollo pluckt mine eare, And warned me, O Tityrus a shepheard it behooues To feed his fattie sheepe, and sing a base and homely song. O Vare now will I exercise and play a countrie tune, Upon a slender [pipe of] reed, for thou shalt haue enow To tell thy praises, and to make [bookes of] thy battels [fought] I do not sing vnbidden things: but yet if any bee, If any be taken with loue, these base songs let him read, O Vare our shrubs shall sing of thee, and so shall euery wood, Ne shall there any booke more pleasing be to mighty Phebe, Than is the same which written hath it selfe the name of Vare. O muses you of hier mount proceed; Chrome and Mnasil The boies saw Silen lie asleepe in caue, his veins puft vp With [swilling] wine but yesterday, as alwaies he is woont, His garlands only fallen from his head did lie far off, And neere him hoong a mightie kan with eare [or handle] worne, These boies setting on Silen cast vpon him binding bands, Made of the very garlands, for old Silen oftentimes Had both these boies beguiled with [vaine] hope of [promis'd] song, Ægle the fair'st of waternymphs hir selfe companion ioind, And commeth in the nicke [to helpe and succour] them afraid. Ægle she paints old Silens browes, and temples of his head, With bloudie [colour] mulberries, he being now awake, And laughing at the subtill iest said [to them] To what end Knit you these knots and bands; O boies loose me, it is ynough That I could haue beene seene of you [being seene but when I list:] Know songs of me now what you will, songs to you [I will sing] [But] to this Ægle shalbe [giuen] another [due] reward: And herewithall old Silen doth begin himselfe to sing. Now truly then thou mightst behold the Fauns and beasts so wild, To play and skip, to leape and danse in number and in time, Stiffe okes also full oft to moue [and shake] their tops aloft, Parnassus hill doth not so much delight and ioy in Phebe, Nor Rhodope and Ismarus [two hils which be in Thrace] Do not so greatly muse and mar-uell at the [songs] of Orph, As all the world reioiseth [whiles old] Silen is a singing. For he did sing how seeds [and first beginnings] of the earth, Of aire and sea and fire so cleere, were made and wrought together, All in a great and emptie space; and how that euery thing [Tooke their] beginnings from these first [foure elements also,] And how the weake and tender globe of all the world [so round] Grew fast and strong in euery part; then how the earth began To harden, and to separat god Nereus from the sea, Also to take the shapes of things, by little and by little, And how the earth amazd did muse at the new sun to shine, And shewrs of raine fall downe from clouds remou'd [or drawne aloft] When as the woods began to rise, and cattell but a few Went straieng ouer hils vnknowne: [then Silen] after this Doth shew of stones by Pyrrha cast, and Saturns kingdome too, And herevpon [he shews] of men the generation, and The first beginnings of all things; the birds of Caucas hill, The theft of Prometh, vnto these he ioins [the tale of Hyle,] As in what sea the mariners cald Hyla left behind, That all the shore [with eccho lowd] did Hyla Hyla sound. And Silen also with the loue of heifer white as snow Doth comfort Pasiph, happie she if buls had neuer beene, Alacke [Pasiph] vnhappy wench, what madnesse thee hath caught? King Pretus daughter fild the fields with mowings like to kine, And yet none of them followed such filthy lusts of beasts, Although [some one of them] had feard the plow vpon hir necke, And often sought in forhed smooth for horns [and yet had none.] Alacke Pasiph vnhappy wench thou wandrest now on hils, That bull [whose] side is vndershord with lillies red doth chew Pale hearbs vnder a blackish holme [blacke in respect of shade:] Or else some cow he followeth in some great flocke or heard. O you the nymphs of Dicte mount, and you the nymphs of woods, Close in the vplands of your woods, if any where perhaps The straieng steps of this same bull vpon the way should beare Themselues vnto your eyes [if them it be your chanse to see.] Some kine will peraduenture bring him vnto Gortyn stals, Delighted with the grasse so greene, or following of the heard. Then Silen sings how Atalant that wench did woonder at The apples of Hesperides, and compasseth about The sisters of [fond] Phaeton with mosse of bitter barke, And lifts them vp out of the ground turnd into alntrees tall. Then sings he how one of the si-sters brought to Æon hils, [The poet] Gallus wandering to Permessus running streames, And how all Phebus company rose vp vnto the man, How Line the shepheard hauing [then] his hairs bedeckt with flours, And bitter smalage said to him these words in heauenly song: The muses giue thee these same pipes (lo take them) which said pipes They gaue a good while since vnto th' old man of Ascra towne, Wherewith he was accustomed by singing to bring downe Stiffe ashtrees from the mounteins: let the first beginning too Of Griney wood be told of thee, that there may be no woods Whereof Apollo more might vaunt and boast [so much as this.] What should I speake rather of Scil-la the king Nisus daughter, Or [of that Scilla] whom report hath followed [saieng that] She hauing hir white priuie parts beset with barking monsters, Tormented Dulichs ships, and rent with cur-dogs of the sea The fearfull seamen [out alas] in gulfe profound and deepe, Or how he told vs of the lims of Terey, which were turnd [Into a bird] what deinty meats, what gifts [faire] Philomel Made redy for him, and what course he tooke to wildernesse, And with what wings [vnlucky man] he fled ouer his house. Silen doth sing of euery thing, which blessed Eurot heard Apollo sometime exercise, and bade the baytrees by To learne [those songs] the vallies low being beaten with the sound Do beare it vp vnto the stars, vntill he had [the boies] Put vp the sheepe into the folds, and tell their number too; And [then] the euening star came foorth against the will of heauen. The seuenth Eclog: intituled Melibeus.Speakers' names in this text have been abbreviated. They are as follows: For Me. read Melibey; For Co. read Corydon; For Th. read Thyris. The Argument. This eclog seemeth wholy taken out of Theocritus, conteining neuerthelesse some things, which by an allegorie might be drawne to the poets purpose. For as Seruius saith, some by Daphnis doo vnderstand Augustus, and not amisse: for he was also supposed to be Apollo or Apollos sonne. By Corydon is meant Virgill, who gat the prayse and prise of his aduersarie Thyrsis. So that in the beginning of this eclog, Melibeus a shepheard (or rather a neatheard, as his name importeth) dooth say that in seeking his cattell, hee fortuned vpon Daphnis, who tarried for him to go and heare a match of piping and plaieng tried betweene Corydon and Thyrsis, promising Melibey that his beasts shall come safelie thither. Some thinke that by Thyrsis is meant some aduersarie of Virgils, encountring with him about excellencie: but others iudge it to be simply taken, and according to the letter: for first of all the poet himselfe speaketh in the person of Melibey. Neuerthelesse, if there were no allegorie herein, howe should wee vnderstand Daphnis his walking by the riuer Mincius, neere the citie Mantua, hee being one of Sicilie. Howbeit take it thus, that by Melibey is meant some citizen or townsman of Mantua, and brought in heere this eclog seeking a stray gote; which citizen had not as yet receiued his lands, to whom notwithstanding Daphnis, that is to say Augustus had promised the full restitution and repossession of the same. The speakers in this eclog, are Melibey, Corydon, and Thyrsis Melibeus. Daphnis by [good] hap sat [him] downe vnder a whizzing holme, And Corydon with Thyrsis droue their flocks all to one [place,] Thyrsis his sheepe, &amp; Corydon his gotes [well] stuft with milke, Both flourishing in age [I meane both in their youthfull yeares] Arcadians both, and equall [youths] to pipe [to play] and sing, And redie [both] to answer [such as challeng'd them therein,] Whiles I do fense my tender trees of myrtle from the cold, The gote himselfe of all the flocke the husband and the man, Came hither straieng downe, and I looke Daphnis full vpon [To helpe me] and when he againe did see me, quicke he spake; Come hither Melibey thy gote is safe, so are thy kids: And if thou canst stay any whit [then] rest thee in the shade, The bullocks they will hither come ouer the meads to drinke, Here Mincius greene hath hid the banks with weake and tender reeds. What should I do? I neither had [the wench] Alcippe by, Nor Phyllis, who might haue shut vp at home [in house] my lambs Put from their milk [weand from their dams] &amp; Corydon had [in hand] A great contention [and a match to trie] with Thyrsis [then:] Yet did I lesse regard mine ear-nest businesse than their play, Therefore they both began to striue with songs avy [by course:] The muses would haue them record [their musicke] both by turns. These Corydon in order, and those Thyrsis did rehearse. Co. O nymphs [named] Libethrides, our loue, grant vnto me Such songs as to my Codrus [you vouchsaft to giue and graunt,] He makes the very next [and like] to Phebus verses [fine] Or if we cannot all make such] then shall our whistle shrill [Our pipe whereon we play] be hangd here on this holy pine. Th. O shepheards you of Arcadie, with iuie decke your port, That Codrus guts may bursten be, for very spite and enuy, Or if he shall [this poet praise too much] beyond our liking, Then compasse you my browes about with [flours of] ladies gloues, Least euill toong should do me hurt, which shall a poet be. Cor. O thou [Diana] Delia [calld] Micon the little youth Doth giue to thee the head of this [same stiffe and] bristlie bore, And branched horns of long liu'd stag if this may be mine owne. Thou shalt stand whole of marble smooth, being braste about the legs With buskins [braue] of purple hew [or colour plesant red.] Th. O Priap thou, it is enough for thee to looke [and haue Of vs] a boll of milke, and yeare by yeare these [baked] cakes, [Bicause] thou art the keeper of a poore [and simple] garden: We haue thee now of marble made, according to the time, But if so bee that bringing foorth of yoong ones doo increase And fill our flocke [with store] then be thou [Priap] all of gold. Cor. O Galath [milke white] nimph &amp; daugh-ter vnto Nereus too More sweet and sauourie to me than hony of Hibla hill More white than swans, more faire [and fine] than iuy [berries] white, So soone as being fed the bulls shall home returne to stalls. Then come thou too, if any care of Coridon possesse thee. Th. Nay rather let me seeme to thee more bitter than the herbs That spring vp in Sardinia soile, more rough [and woorse to handle] Than is [the shrub calld] butchers broome, more vile [&amp; lesse esteemd] Than weeds cast vp [to shore by sea] if that this [present] day, Be not alredy longer than a whole yeare vnto me: O bullockes fed enough, go home, if you haue any shame. Cor. O mossie springs and thou O grasse most soft to sleepe vpon, And thou greene wilding tree which with a shadow thin doth hide you, Keepe off from cattell summer heate, now scortching summer coms, And buds swell now in branches ranke [of vine to bring foorth grapes.] Th. Heere is a herth &amp; gummy wood, heer's fire good store alwaies, The posts are blacke with daily soote: heere we as much doo care For northerne winde, as doth the woolfe [take care] for count of sheepe, O streaming flouds and riuers care for [washing of] their banks. Cor. The iunipers stand [full of frute] the chestnuts heary rough, And vnder trees their scatred frute all sorts lie euery where, Now all things laugh: but if Alex-is faire should from these hills Depart and go, then shouldst thou see the riuers dried vp. Th. The field is dry [&amp; parcht with heat,] the grasse a thirst is dieng, Through fault of aire [corrupt] and Bachus he doth pine and grudge The hills his branches bearing grapes: greene euery wood shall grow, At comming of our Phillis, and sweet wholsome aire good store Shall then come downe with merry shoures [of comfortable raine.] Cor. The Poplar is best pleasing tree to Alcide [Hercules] The Uine to Bacchus, vnto faire Venus the myrtle tree, The baytree vnto Phebus, and Phillis dooth loue the hazels; Whiles Phillis loues them, neither shall the mirtle nor the bay Of Phebus passe the hazell tree [in estimation.] Th. In woods the ash is fairest tree, in gar-dens [sweete] the pine, In riuers [cleere] the poplar tree, in mounteines high the firr, But Lycida faire [youth] if thou wouldst oftentimes me see, The ash in woods, the pine in gar-dens shall giue place to thee. Me. I well remember these same songs [soong Corydon &amp; Thyrse] And Thirses being ouermatcht did striue but all in vaine: Since that time Corydon thou art calld noble Corydon. The eight Eclog intituled Pharmaceutria.Speakers' names in this text have been abbreviated. They are as follows: For Da. read Damon; For Alp. read Alphesibey. The Argument. The eclog being intituled Pharmaceutria or Daphnis, contriueth the rehersall of two shepheards, namely Damon and Alphesibey, the one bewailing the disdainefull loue of Nisa, who had married one Mopsus; the other calleth Daphnis home againe from the city to the country, where his wife abode and dwelt; and this is done by sorcerie or witchcraft, wherof this eclog is framed Pharmaceutria. Now because sorcerie or magicall art did alwaies offend the Romans, and that they could in no wise way with it, and was therfore flatly forbidden to be vsed; the poet therfore followeth a fine fansie of his owne, desiring heere of the muses a charme of Alphesibey, as if himselfe had beene vtterly ignorant of such practises. Touching the person of Alphesibey, beeing a shepherd, you must note that it is allegoricall, &amp; offereth vs this sense or meaning, euen the poets seeking of Agustus his fauour for the recouerie and hauing againe of his lands and cattell. As for Damon it seemeth he is the same man whom Dametas bragd he had ouer come; and Alphesibey to be him whom it it is said in the eclog called Daphnis in these words, Alphesibey shall counterfet the dansing satyrs too. Now for the kind of poetrie heere vsed, it is altogether mixt: for the poet himselfe speaketh, and so doo the persons by him presented vnto vs in this eclog. The poets speech is wholy directed to Augustus, whose fauor he seeketh euen at the very entrance. To Augustus, the complaint of a louer, and Pharmaceutria: the speakers Damon and Alphesibey Of shepherds [two] Damon [by name] and eeke Alphesibey [Now] wil we sing a song, at whom contending [t'one with t'other] The heifers yoong [much meruelled, forgetting grasse [to eat:] At which [two shepherds] songs also; the Lynces [were] amazd, And riuers being chang'd and turnd did stay their course [stood still.] Of Damon and Alphesibey now will we shew the songs, O thou Augustus whether thou passe ouer now the rocks Of great Timauus [floud] or sailst and gatherest [neere] the coast, Of sea Illicran, [named now Sclauonian,] to that day Shalbe as neuer any was, when lawfull it may bee For me to shew thine acts and deeds; lo then the day shalbe When lawfull it shalbe for me to beare all round about The world thy songs, thy verses which alone are worthy of The buskins [braue] of Sophocles [I meane his stately stile.] The first beginning [of these songs] which taken is at thee, Shall end at thee, receiue the songs beegun at thine owne bidding, And let this iuy creepe about the temples of thine head, Among the conquering [leaues of] bay which doo betoken triumph. The shadow cold of night had scarse from heauen high departed, When as the dew on tender grasse best pleasing is to beasts, Damon himselfe leaning against a long round oliue tree, Began in maner thus [to sing a song of guilefull loue.] Da. O lucifer [bright morning star] arise and comming now Before the comfortable day, draw on and set it forward, Whiles I beguilde with loue vnkind of Nisa she my wife Complaine, and dieng call vpon the gods in my last houre, Although I nothing prou?ted by witnesse theirs to me O pipe begin Menalian songs, begin with me to sing. Mount Menalus hath euermore a shrill and whizzing wood, And speaking pinetrees, euermore it heareth shepherds loues, Yea Pan, who was the very first that would not suffer reeds to be vnskilfull [but of them did make most cunning pipes:] O Pipe begin Menalian songs, begin with me to sing. Nisa that wench is giuen away to Mops [a fowle faste man] What should we not [poore] louers hope [or rather feare] will bee, Now griffins shalbe ioynd [in loue] with horses, and in times And ages following fearefull deers shall come with dogs to drinke: O Mopsus cut new gummy sticks, now thou doost wed a wife, And maried man cast nuts abrode; the euening star hath left. [The mountaine] Oeta for thy sake, [thy wished night is come:] O pipe begin Menalian songs, begin with me to sing. O Nisa coupled to a man [worthy of such a wife] Whilst thou despisest all but him, and whiles my pipe in hate [And foule disfauour] is with thee, and whiles my silly gotes, Mine eybrews hearie rough [beeside] my beard growne in length, [Are almost irksome vnto thee;] Ne doost thou yet beleeue That any god regards or cares for things of mortall men: O Pipe begin Menalian songs, begin with me to sing. I haue thee seene a little one [and] gathering frute bedewd Within our gardens hedgd about, thy mother then with thee, I was your guide, and [of mine age] the second yeere to eleuen, [My thirteenth yeere] had then begun, and I could reach and touch The brittle boughs, vpon the ground [as on my feet I stood;] So soone as I [thy face] had seene, oh how I was vndoone; Oh how ill error [raging loue] hath carried me away; O Pipe begin Menalian songs, begin with me to sing. Now doo I know [by triall true] what [cruell] thing loue is, The hill Ismar or Rhodope, th' vnciuill garamants, Are furthest [proofe of all the world, in Afrike which doo dwell] Breed and bring foorth that boy among the hard and stonie rocks, [A boy] not of our kind and bloud [but of another nature:] O Pipe begin Menalian songs, begin with me to sing. Curst loue and cruell taught a mo-ther [she Medea cald] All to defile her hands with bloud of her owne naturall sonne; Thou also cruell mother wast: but heere a question growes,] Whether the mother or the naugh-tie boy more cruell were? That naughtie boy he cruell was, so cruell mother thou: O Pipe begin Menalian songs, begin with me to sing. Now let the woolfe of one accord depart and void from sheepe, Now let hard okes beare apples [faire of yellow hew] like gold, Let alnetree bloome and flourish with narcisse or daffodily, Let shrubs [and bushes] at their barks sweat gummy amber out, Let owles contend and striue in song with swans [Apollos birds] Let Tytyrus be Orpheus now, yea Orpheus in the woods, And [braue] Arion [musicks pearle] among the dolphins too: O pipe begin Menalian songs, begin with me to sing. Let all things be the midst of sea [as therewith ouerflowne] O woods farwell and liue [for] I will hedlong downe be throwne Into the water from the view of mounteine high in th' aire; O Nisa take and haue this gift, the last of me now dieng: O pipe leaue of Menalian songs now ceasse and leaue them off. These songs soong Damon, O Pie-rides you muses shew What answered Alphesibey? we cannot all [do] all. Alp Bring water foorth, and bind with fillets soft these altars round Burne veruine fat and full of iuice, and frankincense the best, That I may try to turne away the right wits of my husband With sacrifices magicall [of witchcraft] and inchantment; Nothing is wanting now but charms [which woonders great do worke] O you my charms bring Daphnis from the town, bring Daphnis home. Charms able are from heauen high to fetch the moone adowne, With charms did Circe turne and change Vlisses fellowes [shapes] With charming is the snake so cold in medowes burst to peeces: O you my charms bring Daphnis from the town, bring Daphnis home. I twist for thee euen first of all these threeds [in number] three, In colour threefold differing, and thrise about these altars I draw thy liuely counterfet: God ioies in number od: O you my charms bring Daphnis from the town, bring Daphnis home. O Amaryll knit in three knots those [twisted] colours three, O Amaryll knit by and by, and say I knit the knots Of Venus [to procure and cause kindnesse and loue againe:] O you my charms bring Daphnis from the town, bring Daphnis home. As this same durt doth harden, and this same wax doth soften, With one and selfe same [heat of] fire, so Daphnis with our loue; Cast meale abrode, and brittle baies with brimstone set on fire, That naughty Daphnis burneth me, on him this bay I'le burne: O you my charms bring Daphnis from the town, bring Daphnis home. Let such loue hold [and full possesse] Daphnis, as when a cow Lustie and yoong being wearie made with seeking of a bull, Through woods and groues [now vp now downe, at last] doth lie along Upon the grasse so greene hard by a spring of water [cleere] Undone [and cast away with loue] ne doth remember [once] Thense to depart, and go away from late [and darksome] night, Let such loue haue Daphnis in hold, ne care in me to heale him. O you my charms bring Daphnis fr? the towne, bring Daphnis home. That faithlesse Daphnis left me once these garments [from his backe,] Which might be pledges deere of him [and tokens of remembrance,] Which pledges I betake to thee O earth now at mine entrance [Into my house,] these pledges shall [bring] Daphnis [backe to me:] O you my charms bring Daphnis from the town, bring Daphnis home One Meris he gaue me these hearbs, and these same poisons too, Which gathered were in Pontus [sea] for me [and my behoofe] Great plenty of them grow in Pont. I oftentimes haue seene Meris become a woolfe with these, and hide himselfe in woods, To raise vp souls out of their graues full many a time and oft, And I haue seene Meris remoue and carrie corne new sowne From one field to another, [and all by these hearbs effect:] O you my charms bring Daphnis fr? the towne, bring Daphnis home. O Amaryll bring ashes out, and cast them ouer head Into the flowing riuer, I will Daphnis set vpon With these same ashes, nothing he doth care for gods ne charms, O you my charms bring Daphnis fr? the towne, bring Daphnis home. Behold and see the ashes haue caught hold vpon the altars, With trembling flames of owne accord, while I prolong the time To carry them; good lucke may't be, I know not what it is, And Hylax now our bandog-barks, euen at the entry doore, May we beleeue [Daphnis is come?] or else that such as loue, Doo faine but dreams vnto themselues [things neither so nor so:] Cease O my charms, Daphnis is come out of the towne, now cease. The ninth Eclog: intituled Meris.Speakers' names in this text have been abbreviated. They are as follows: For Me. read Meris; For Ly. read Lycidas. The Argument. This eclog is not wholy taken out of Theocritus, but some places therof, according as the poet made choise of matter to serue his turne. The sum of this eclog is this. Virgill after hee had bin well nigh slain by Arius a captaine ouer a hundred soldiors, returning to Rome, gaue charge to his bailifs or seruants to see his lands safely kept, and for the present time to be dutifull and obedient to the said Arius. Now Meris one of Uirgils seruants, in maner of a shepheard, carrieth kids on his necke to the citie Mantua for a present to Arius therby t'asswage the anger and discontentment of his mind, if he would vouchsafe to like well of so simple a gift. Meris being vpon his way, and his burden on his backe, another shepheard named Lycidas ouertaking him, asketh whether hee is going? To whom Meris making no direct answer, but full of inward greefe falleth into a lamentable complaing of his present miseries. Whervpon occasion is offered both to the one and the other of singing sundry sorts of songs and deuises, as came into their heads by means of this their meeting &amp; communication. The speakers are Lycidas and Meris. Lycidas. O Meris whither [tread] thy feet? the way that leads to towne? Me. O Lycid we aliue are come [to this vnhappy time] (Which we did neuer fear or doubt) that euen a stranger [meere] [Made] owner of our little land, may say These [goods] are mine, Depart, be gone you dwellers old. Now we quite ouercome And sad do send that owner [who possesseth all our grounds] These kids [as gift] which would to God may turne him to no good, Sith lucke and lot turns vpside downe, all things [that worldly be.] Ly. Truly I heare [reported that] your friend Menalcas saued By verses [which this man hath made, his lands and liuings] all [Lieng and being there] whereas the mountains do begin To shrinke and to remoue themselues, and downward bow their tops With soft [and easie] banke [to clime] as far as Mincius riuer, And broken tops of beeches old [now very much decaid.] Me. O Lycid thus thou heardst, and so the fame and rumor was, But yet our verses do so much preuaile among the wars, As doues of Chaon (do men say) when as the eagle coms. And if so be the lefthand crow had warned me before From hollow holme to [put away] new strifes and cut them off, By any kind of means; ne this thy Meris should haue liued, Nor Menalc neither [I and he had both of vs beene slaine.] Ly. Alacke, and can so foule a deed befall to any man? Alacke Menalc, and should thy ioies [thy verses sweet and fine] Haue welnigh with thy selfe from vs beene snatcht perforce away? Who then should sing of nymphs? who th? should spred the ground with flours? Or who should couer watersprings w? shade [of trees so] green? Or [who should sing the verses] which I stole of late from thee Holding my peace, when as thou went'st to Amaryll our ioy? O Tityr feed my gotes till I come backe, my way is short, And being fed, driue them to drinke, and Tityr in their driuing Take heed to meet the maistergote, he striketh with his horns. Me. Nay then who should these sonnets sing, which Menalc he himself Did sing to Vare, not perfect yet, O Vare the singing swans Thy name shall beare aloft to stars [conditionally] so that Our [citie] Mantua may remaine for vs [therein to dwell:] Our Mantua too too neere alacke, to wretched Cremon towne. Ly. O Mere begin [to sing] if thou haue any [song in store] So let thy swarms of bees auoid the yewghs of Cirnos Ile. So let thy kine with cithyse fed their vdders stuffe [with milke:] And the Pierides also haue me a poet made, I likewise verses haue and songs, and shepherds say also That I a poet am, but yet I doo them not beleeue, For neither seeme I songs to sing worthie of Vare or Cinna, But all among the swans shrill to gaggle like a goose. Me. I doo the same in very deede [prepare my selfe to sing] And with my selfe holding my peace I thinke vpon [a song] If I, O Lycid, able were to call it vnto mind, It is a song none of the ba-sest [but the very best.] O Galath hither come, for what pastime is in the waters? Here is the purple flouring spring, here doth the ground affoord Flours sundrie sorts all round about the riuers [which do grow] The poplar white here ouerhangs the caue, and bending vines Do shadie places weaue and wind [with spreading of their branches:] Come hither Galath, let the flouds outragious smite the shores. Ly. What [saist thou of those songs] which I heard thee singing alone Upon an euening faire and bright? the tune I do remember, If that I knew the words [the note I haue but not the dittie.] Me. O Daphnis why beholdest thou th' old risings of the signs? Lo Cæsar, Dioneus star is come abrode [and shines,] The star wherby all seeds would ioy in [bringing foorth of] frute, Whereby also the grapes would draw a colour vnto them, On hils [which] warme and open [lie against the shining sunne:] O Daphnis graft thou peartrees now, thine heirs shall crop the frute, Age taketh all things quite away, yea mind and memorie too. I [well] remember when I was a boy, full oft I made Long sunnie daies with singing [then whole daies I spent in songs,] Now are so many songs forgot, and Meris voice doth faile him, The woolues spide Meris first [and so they tooke away my speech:] But yet these songs shall Menalc oft ynough rehearse to thee. Ly. O Meris in excusing thee, thou doost prolong our loues, Now euery sea being still and calme doth hold his peace for thee, And (see) all blasts of windie noise are falne [and quite alaid] Our midway this [to Mantua] is from this place where we be, For why the toome of Bianor [the builder of that citie] Begins t'appeare. O Meris here let vs twaine sing [and pipe] Euen here where husbandmen do lop and cut down boughs so thicke, Heere lay thou downe thy kids [awhile] yet shall we [time enough] Come to the citie [Mantua] or if so be we doubt Least that the night should gather raine before [we thether reach,] Let vs go sluging thorough quite, the way wil hurt vs lesse. And that we may go singing, I will ease thee of this lode. Me O youth leaue off &amp; cease [to moue] more matters at this time] And let vs doo that businesse first which stands vs now in hand, Then may we better sing when as Menalc himselfe is come. The tenth and last Eclog of the mad loue of Cornelius Gallus. The Argument. In this last eclog the poet aduaunceth the loue of Gallus, but yet so, as that he swarueth not from the persons and comparisons of shepheards. Touching the argument, it is all in maner taken out of Thirsis, that is, the first Idyll of of Theocritus, who handleth the like matter in all points in his Daphnis. How this Gallus was an excellent poet, and so familiar with Cæsar, and likewise so fauoured of him, that he gaue and bestowed vpon him the gouernment of Ægypt. Howbeit afterwards growing in suspicion of c?spiracie or treason against Cæsar, he was slaine at his commandement. Uirgill did so deerely loue this Gallus, that in praise of him he spent wel nigh all the end of the fourth booke of his Georgikes, which place the poet (Augustus Cæsar so charging him to doo) if we may beleeue the supposall of Seruius, after Gallus was put death, changed into the fable or talke of Aristus. In this eclog the poet Virgill himselfe is the onely speaker. O Arethus [thou nimphe] grant me this labour last [of mine,] Uerses a few are to be said of Gallus my [good freend,] But which [said] verses let Lico-ris read hir selfe [also,] Uerses [and songs] are to be said; who would denie to Gall Uerses? nay then who would not write verses vnto his praise?] [O Arethuse] begin [to sing.] So bitter Doris she, Let hir not mix with thee hir streames, when thou shalt eb and flow Under the flouds of sicill sea. [now] let vs chant and sing The carefull loues of Gall, whiles that the litle flat nozde gotes Shall crop and nip the tender twigs: we sing not to the deafe, The woods doo answere euery thing [with sound of eccho shrill,] O wenches you the Naiades, what woods, what groues held you? [Where were you] when as Gall did pe-rish by disdainfull loue? For neither any tops of [high] Parnassus hill, nor yet Of Pindus [mount] made any stay [ne caused you to tarry,] Nor Aganippe [spring which is with] in Aonia [land] [Could make you stay,] yea euen the bayes beewaild &amp; mon'd my Gall, So did the shrubs and bushes lowe, so did the Menal mount, Which beareth pinetrees, so likewise the very rocks and stones Of Licey [mounteine] cold bewaile [and lamentably moorne] For Gallus being vnderneath a solitarie rocke, And round about him stand the sheepe ne shames at them of vs, Nor let it shame thee poet great of cattell and of sheepe, For faire Adonis fed [and gra-sed] sheepe by riuers [side,] And shepheads too with swine herds slow came [to the poet Gall,] Menalcas also wringing wet with [gathering] winter akorns, All [these] after Gall from whense this loue [extreame of his should be.] Apollo came himselfe and said, what Gallus art thou mad? Lycoris all thy care and ioy doth follow another man, Through [frost and] snow and dredfull campe [or tents of soldiers stout.] Syluanus too with countrie pompe and honor on his head, [A garland made of flours and leaues] came also vnto Gall, Shaking his flouring feruls and his lilles [faire and] great. God Pan of Arcadie he came, whom we saw [coloured] red With bloudie berries of ebull tree, and also vermilion, And [Pan] said vnto Gall, what mea-sure [or what end] shalbe [Of this thy sadnes?] loue regards ne cares for such [behauiors,] Neither is cruell loue content or satisfide with teares, Nor grasse with riuers [watring them,] nor bees with cytise [flours] Nor little shee gooes with the leaues [and tender sprigs of trees:] But he pensife and sad dooth say, o you Arcadians [all,] Who are alone the cunning men to sing [my wretched case] O then how soft [and all at ease] my bone should take their rest, If that your pipe hereafter shall report these loues of mine: And would to god I had beene one of you, and eeke had beene Either the keeper of your flocks, or dresser of [your vines,] Or gatherer of your grapes full ripe, then truly whether shee, Phillis, had beene my [louer deere,] or Amint [my delight] Or any other raging loue (what then, if Amint bee Both blacke [and swart] so violets and vaccins too are blacke:) Yet Amint he should lie with me among the willow trees. Under the limber bending vines [neere Mantua which doo grow:] Phillis should gather garland floures, and Amint he should sing. Heere o Lycoris [louer mine] are water springs so coole, And heere be medows soft [with grasse,] heere also is a wood, Heere would I wasted be with age, [and spend my life] with thee, New raging loue keeps me in armes of hard [and warlike] Mars, Among the midst of weapons, and of foes against vs [bent.] Alacke Lycoris thou art far away from country thine, And all alone without me thou hard [wench] doost see the snow Of Alpine [hills] and [feel'st] the cold-nesse of the [riuer] Rhene, (Ne could I credit or beleeue a thing so great and strange) Alacke Lycoris [o beware] least coldnesse doo the hurt, Alacke Licoris least sharpe yse doo cut thy tender feete. I will be gone and exercise, [or play] vpon the pipe Of the sicilian shepherd, [who had Theocrit to name,] Songs made by me in Calcid verse, [in old Zuphorions verse, A poet borne in a Chalcis towne within the ile of Greece.] It is decreed and purposed of me to suffer rather [This miserie] in woods amoong the dens of beastes so wilde, And graue in tender trees my bones; these trees shall spring and grow, And you my [raging] loues [with them] shall likewise spring and grow. In the meane time about the mount of Menal I will walke, Mingled [and well accompanied] with nimphs [which there doo keepe] Or I will hunt the bores so wilde, no cold shall me forbid. [Ne let or hinder me] to com-passe round about with dogs The woods vpon Parthenius hill. I seeme now to my selfe To go through rocks and sounding woods, it is my pleasure too. Out of a Parthian [bowe, at th' ends which tipped is with] horne To shoot Cydonian arrows [swift,] as if so be this were The medcine of our raging loue; or else [that Cupid hee] That god may learne in mens mishaps [ah] gentle to become, Those [nimphs] the Hamadryades [which liue and die with trees, And cheefly with the okes] doo no-thing please me now againe, No not my songs themselues: o woods remoue you hense againe, Our labours cannot change ne turne [Cupid] that god [of loue,] No not if Hebeus floud we should drinke vp amidst the cold, Or go and suffer scythian snows of watrie winter season, Nor if we should [in feeding] shift the sheepe of Æthiops [blacke] Under the star of Cancer; when the barke in elmetree high Dieng [with scortching heat of sun] doth dry and parch away. Loue ouercommeth euery thing, and let vs yeeld to loue. O [ladies] you Pierides, it shalbe [now] enough That [I] your poet [Virgill] haue these [foresaid sonnete] soong, Whiles he sits still, and [also] makes a little mawnd or basket Of slender twigs [or ozier rods O you] Pierides These songs you most shall make to Gall; to Gall, the loue of whome Growes euery houre so much in me, as in the spring time fresh The alnetree greene shoots vp itselfe [in tallnesse and in hight. But let vs rise, the shade is woont to singers to be hurtfull, The shadow of the iuniper is noisome, and to frute The shadowes also do much harme: O you my little gotes Full fed go home, the euening comes, my little gotes go home.

      <field name="fulltext">The Georgiks Of Publius Virgilius Maro: Otherwise called his Italian Husbandrie, TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, IOHN Archbishop of Canterburie, Primat and Metropolitane of England, A. F. wisheth abundant increase of all heauenly and spirituall blessings. The first Booke of Virgil his Georgiks, otherwise called his Rurals or Husbandrie, Made for the climat of Italie specially, &amp;c. The argument of Modestinus a lawyer vpon the first Booke. The poet Virgil [in this first booke of his Georgiks heere] Hath plainly taught what thing c? make the corne feelds ranke and lustie, [Or corne delightsome, whose increase makes th' owners merry men] What stars [what seasons] th' husbandman should duly marke and keepe, How he should cut vp casie moold with plough, and how his seeds Are to be throwne into the ground: [and he hath plainly taught] The tilling and good husbanding of places [fit therefore,] And haruests to be made [restord] with great increase and gaine. The first Booke of the Georgiks, written to Mecenas, a nobleman. Learned, and in great fauour with Augustus Cæsar: Vnto this Mecenas was Virgil and Horace much Beholden, not only for the familiaritie which he vouch- Safed them, but also for the manifold good courtesies And benefites wherewith he releeued them, &amp;c. O my Mecenas, ile begin heereafter to declare, What thing may make corne-ground to be [in yeelding] fat and ranke And vnder what stars [influence] it were conuenient [meete] To turne [with plow] the land, and ioine the vines to trees of elme, And what regard were to be had of oxen, and what care Of cattell, and how great a proofe in [thriftie] sparing bees. O you the cleerest lights [that he] of all the world [so round,] Bacchus and Ceres nourishing, which leade about the yeare Falling from heauen, [which is the cause of seasons in their course,] Sith that the earth by your [good] gifts hath changed Chaon akorns For bread-corne ranke and ripe [to reape,] and mingled hath [also] Achelo pots with grapes, found out [water I meane with wine,] And O you Fawnes [of Woods, the Gods, and Cattell-keepers too,] You present Gods of Husband-men, you Fawns, and Driads, you [The Nymphs of Trees, &amp; chiefly Okes,] set hither-ward your foote, Your gifts [bestowd] I sing abroade: And thou ô Neptune God, Of whome the earth smitten with great three-fold mace brought foorth The first fierce snorting Horsse that was: And ô [Aristey] thou The louing friend of wods, for whom three hundred snow-white heifers Do crop the bushie places ranke [with iuice] of Cea ile. O Pan of Tege [Citie,] though thy welcall mountaines be A care to thee, thou leauing quite the wood where thou wast borne, And keeper of the Sheepe vpon Lycean loftie hils, Assist me: and Minerua th' inuenter of th' Oliue tree, And ô thou youth [Triptolemus] of crooked Plow deuiser: And ô Syluanus setting of the tender Cypres tree, [Springing] out of the roote [assist and present be with me.] O all you Gods and Goddesses, in whome there is a care To keepe and saue the fallow feelds, and nourish with some seede [Of natures secret force] the corne new [sowne] and which send downe Fr? heauen large large showrs of rain vp? the land w? seed-corne sowne. And thou ô Cæsar, whome it is vncertaine what assemblies Of Gods shall haue thee them among, or that thou wouldst vuchsafe To visite cities, and likewise of countries take the charge, And [so] most [part of all the] world should take and knowledge thee Of fruits the author, and of stormes [the ruler] strong to be: Or compassing about thy head with mothers myrtle leaues, Shouldst come [to be] of seas most huge the God, and sea-men [so] Might worship all alone thy maiestie most excellent. The vtmost iland Thule should thee serue, and Thetis boy Thee for to be her sonne in law with [gift of] waters all. But mayst thou not much rather ioyne thy selfe a new bright star, Betweene [the signes] Erigone, and Chelies following next? Now scortching Scorpius draweth in his armes [or crooked clooches] And leaueth roome enough in heauen for thee, and some to spare, Whatsoeuer (Cæsar) thou shalt be for let not [hel-hounds] hope For thee to be a king to them; ne let so curst a wish Of reigning happen vnto thee: though Greece [deuising lies] Doth maruell at the Elysian feelds, [places of ioy belowe,] Nor yet Proserpina [though she] desired was and praid, Doth care to follow [vp to heauen] her mother Ceres steps, Graunt me an easie course, and vnto my beginnings nod, And pitying the poore countrie folks, vnskilfull of the way [To practise works of husbandrie,] set in thy foote with me, And now enure thy selfe to be by rowes called vpon. In spring time now when as the cold [snowe] water melted is Upon the hoarie [frostie] hilles, and rotten clod of earth With westerne wind doth thawe it selfe, euen then let oxe begin For me to groane at plow borne downe-ward [deep in ground to cut,] And plowshare worne with furrowes [drawne] brightly begin to shine, That eared land for seed contents at least the wisht desires Of husbandmen [most] couetous, which twise hath felt the sunne, And twise the cold, [which kind of ground we fallow feelds do call,] Th' unmeasurable haruests breake his barnes [being ouerfull.] But let our care be first yer we cut th' eeuen and plaine feeld Unknowne [to vs for lack of proofe] with iron [culters knife] To learne the windes, and of the heauen the diuers influence, And countries proper tilth by kind, and qualities of places; And what each seuerall soyle should beare, and what it should refuse, Heere corne, there grapes come vp [and do] more plentifully [grow.] Yong trees else-where, &amp; grasse &amp; bud spring vp [aboue the ground.] And seest thou not how Timolus Mount, sends sauourie saffron out? How India yeeldeth iuory, how nice and tender Sabeis Affoord good frankincense? but yet the naked Chalibeis Send iron [and steele] and Pontus ile [doth plentifully yeeld] Good medicines made of beauers stones, most strong and full of force. Epirus ile [doth yeeld] the palme and floure of Elis mares, [Best breeders of great horsses which in running woon the game] Nature hath set immediatly to places euery one. These lawes and euerlasting leagues, when as, and at what time Deucalion cast behind him stones into the emptie world; Whereof sprang men, an offspring hard. Wherefore go to, and let Strong ox turne vp ranke ground foorthwith, in first months of the yeare, And dustie summer breake the clods lieng [vnoccupide And naught for vse vnles prepard] with seasonable sun. But if the soile vnfrutefull is, it shall sufficient be To let it lie vnlaboured, vntill the north star [rise] With little furrowes [once with plow in slender maner made] There, least the weeds should hurt the corne [in rising growing ranke] Heere, least the little raine should fall the barren sandie soile, Thou one and selfe same man shalt suf-fer feelds but newly reapt To cease [and lie vnv'sd] by course each second yeare that coms, And slouthfull [fruteles] ground wax hard with mooldie dung &amp; durt, Or thou shalt there sowe yellow corne, the time of yeare being chang'd Whence erst thou tookest plentifull [increase of] bull imoong, [As beanes &amp; pease] with shaking cod; or [whence thou gatheredst erst] Thy crop of vitches thin and small, of lupins sad also, [Hauing] but fraile and brittle stalks, and store of sounding straw, For hempe or flaxseed burns the feeld, the seed of otes doth burne, And poppie tempered thoroughly with most forgetfull steepe, Doth drie and burne [the ground as do the named seeds afore] But yet each second yeare by turns, an easie labour 'tis Seed corne to sowe [as wheat and rie] only be not ashamed To season well and thoroughly with doong both fat and ranke Thy leane and hungrie soile; nor yet to cast foule filthie durt All ouer barren fruteles feelds. So likewise shall the fallowes Rest and remaine [vnoccupide] their kind of seed being changd, No thanks is due vnto the ground, whiles it doth lie vntild, It hath beene good and profitable oft times to set on fire The barren feelds, and stubble light with crackling flames to burne, Either bicause the grounds thereby do [inwardly] receiue A secret force and [more than that] a fattning nourishment, Or else bicause each ill default is tride thereout by fire, And so thunprofitable moi-sture sweateth out of it: Or that the heate doth looze [and o-pen make] the many waies And breathing places blind [vnseene] there where the iuice should come Into the new [sproong] blades; or that it hardens fast and binds [Or closeth vp] the gaping veins [or holes within the ground] Least little showrs or fearcer force of swift hot drawing sun, Or persing cold of northerne wind should burne and blast [the same.] He which with harrow breaks the clods vnseruiceable yet, And draggeth hurdels made of wic-ker rods and bending sticks, Doth helpe the fallows very much, ne looketh yellow Ceres Upon him vainely [to no end] from heauen [that is so] hie, And him which breakes againe with plow turnd ouerthwart the ridges [Of furrows such] as he cast vp before in champion ground [Or leueld land eeuen and plaine] with plowshare erst cut vp, And often laboureth his land, and ouerrules his feelds. O husbandmen wish summers wet, and winters faire [to haue] Corne is delighted much [and great-ly ioyes] in winters dust, The field is glad and ioies therein, and Misia countrie soile, Uaunts not it selfe ne brings in a-ny tillage [toile] so much: And Gargara mountains maruell not so much at haruest theirs, [No husbandry makes ground more frutefull than a winter drie.] What should I say of him which ha-uing cast his seed [and sowne] Doth follow [with] his fallow field [and trim it] out of hand, And spreads abrode the lumps of sand but badly fat [or leane] And after brings vnto his seed [or ground alredie sowne] A streame of waters following [or draining therevnto] And when the field being scorcht and burnt is hot and very drie, The blade [then] dieng, lo [how] he doth fetch from lofty brow Of steepe and cliftie passages [cleere] water [gliding downe:] The same [so] falling mooues and makes a hoarse and murmuring noise By and among the smoothed stones, and with his drains or streams Doth moisten and giue liquor to the corne fields drie with thirst. What [should I say of him] who least the stalke should lie along With ears of corne growne big and large, doth eat away [by beasts] The ranknes of the corne in ten-der blade [when vp it shoots] And when the blade is equall with the furrowes [and no higher.] And what [should I report of him] which voids and takes away With soking sand the water [flouds] gathered as in a fen Especially, if so be that the floud [which fell by raine] Abounding ouerflow his banks in months that doubtfull be, Possessing places all abrode with mud quite ouerlaid, Whereby the hollow ditches sweat with lukewarme [wetting] raine. And albeit these things be worke of oxen and of men Trained and tride in turning vp the ground [with helpe of plough] Yet doth the naughty goose, nor yet the cranes of Strymon lake, Nor intyba with bitter tang-led roots annoy or hurt: The shadow hurteth not, [but fa-ther Iupiter] himselfe Would not the way of tilling [land] should easie be [but hard] And he himselfe stird field vp first [and laboured the land] Whetting the harts of mortall men with cares, ne suffred he His realms [and people] stiffe to be with noisome drowsinesse. No husbandmen did dresse the ground before god Iupiter, Ne lawfull was it for to marke or part the field with bounds, But [men] in common liuing sought: the earth it selfe also Did freely beare all things, no bo-die willing [bidding] it. He [Iupiter] gaue serpents blacke their venem [vile] And he commanded woolues also to rauen and to spoile, The sea by sailing to be stird, and he smit downe from leaues [Of trees sweet] honie and [from vse of men] put fire away: And he held in [or bounded vp] wine running euery where In riuers [for this end] that vse and exercise might wring, And by deuising beat out arts by little and by little, [And occupations diuers sorts] and might in furrowes seeke For blades of corne, and smite out fire hidden in veins of flint. Then first felt flouds the alnetree wood made hollow [botes and ships] Then gaue the mariner to stars their numbers and their names, The Pleiads, Heiads, and the star of Lycaon so cleere, Then was deuisd wild beasts to take with snares, and to deceiue [Poore sillie birds] with lime, and to compasse great parks with dogs. Now one with slingnet beats vpon the riuer brode and large, Reaching vnto the very depth, another puls and drawes Out of the water [fishing] lines [all moist and wringing] wet, Then was [found out] of iron the stif-nesse, and plate of shrill saw, For men at first did cut their wood, easie to cleaue, with wedges; Then diuerse occupations and trades came vp in vse, For ceaslesse labour maistreth and ouercoms all things, And so doth preasing pouertie and need in cases hard. Ceres first taught and trained men with iron [tools] to turne [And plow] the ground, euen then when a-korns and the frutes of trees Did faile in holy wood, and when Dodona food denide: And by and by mishap was sent [and casualtie] to corne [Namely] that blasting mischeefous should eat the stems and stalks, And idle [frutelesse] thistles should grow stiffe and rough in fields: The corne decaies and dies, great store of sharpe and pricking weeds, As burs &amp; brambles come in place, and naughtie darnell with The barren otes beare sway among the goodly plowed lands. And sure, vnlesse thou wilt apply and follow well thy ground With harrowing it continually, and fray away the birds With [some deuised] noise, and cut or plash away with bill The shadie boughs of sunlesse soile, and wilt both call and cry [To god aboue] by praier for raine: alacke thou shalt behold [But] all in vaine huge heaps of [corne belonging to] another And shalt asswage thy hunger with the shaken oke in woods. Now must I also shew what tools hard husbandmen should haue, Without all which the haruest corne could not be sowne nor rise: A plowshare first with weighty oke [or wood] of crooked plow, And waines of mother Eleusine [Ceres of Eleusis] Going on wheeles [but] slowly, flails, and sleds with harrowes of Uneuen weight, and furthermore the simple furniture Of Celeus [king of Eleusis] with rods of wicker wrought, And hardles made of bending wood, and Bacchus secret fan All which thou being mindfull of, shalt lay vp [or lay by] Prouided long before [thou need] if that the worthy praise And glory of gods [blessed] earth remaine or bide in thee. Immediatly whiles elme is yoong, 'tis tamed in the woods, And by maine strength [it being] bowd, a plowtaile it is made, And takes the shape and fashion of the crooked plow also: A plowbeame eight foot long from th' end, two ears or handles [fit] [With] culters double backt are hand-some made and fit hereto: The light [wood of the] Tilie tree is cut downe for a yoke So is the beechtree hie and tall: the plow handle also, The which should turne the cart behind [in following of the plow] And let the smoke trie well the wood hangd vp in chimney drie. I could thee many lessons tell of old and aged men, But that thou doost refuse and shrug to know [such] slender cares. The ground must first be plaine and leuell laid with roller great, And to be turnd with hand, and with fast chalke firme to be made, Least weeds should grow, or ouercome with dust the same should gape: Then diuers plages [or vermine vile] deceiue [the husbandman] The little mouse hath plast his house oft vnderneath the ground, And made his barns [or garners there] or else the moldwarps blind Haue digd them couches there to lodge, and in the hollow holes The tode is found, and many mon-sters more the earth brings foorth, The weuell [a deuouring worme] destroies huge heapes of corne, So doth the pismere fearing much hir needy helplesse age. Behold and see likewise when as the tall and long nut tree, [Or almon] shall shoot out hir flours and blossoms in the woods, And shall hir smelling branches bow; if [then] the frutes abound, Corne in like measure follow will, and threshing [worke] great [store] Will come with great [and feruent] heat [by labour or by time] But if the shadow do abound by ranknesse of the leaues, The barne floore shall both bruse and beat the straw of hungrie husks. I many men haue seene t'amend and help their seed [in] sowing, As first with saltishpeter and blacke dregs of oile to wet it, That greater grains might be conteind in the deceitfull husks, And might be moist, being hastened vnto a fire but small. I haue seene seeds both chosen long, and with much labour tride, Grow out of kind neuerthelesse: but that mans will and wit Did yearely choose the largest [seed] and gather it by hand: So [haue I seene] all things by dest-nie fall into the woorst, And fallen downe still backward driuen, none otherwise than he Which hard and skant doth forward driue his bote with rowing [much] Against the streame, if he perhaps let go and ease his arms, [And slacker hold doth take of ores by means his strength decaies] And so the channell in the floud descending with a fall, Doth catch and carry him away hedlong into the deepe. Beside all this, the very stars of Arcture north trulie, And eke the daies of Hedi, with the bright and glistering snake, Must marked be no lesse [of vs which plow and till the ground] Than seas of Pontus, or the swal-lowing gulfe of Abyd towne Of oisters hauing store, are tride of such as carried be Through windie waues into the land where they were bred and borne. [The signe of Libra must likewise obserued be and markt] Bicause when Libra shall make euen th' hours of day and night, And now hath parted in the world to light and shade, [And made the day and night to be of iust and equall length] Then O good husbands exercise and set your ox to worke: Sow barlie in your feelds vntill the latter raine [that fals] Of winter time vnseasonable: now also is the time To hide in th' earth your seed of hempe, and Ceres poppie white, [Poppie of Ceres or of corne, bicause it growes with corne] And painfully to plie the plow, a few daies now together, Whiles that you may, the ground being drie, &amp; clouds hang [in th' aire] Seed time for beans in spring of yeare [is fit] and then also Do rotten furrowes thee, O thou three leau'd Medica, And then for Millet or for Hirst coms yearly care and paine, When Taurus white with golden horns doth open you the yeare And Caius mouing goeth downe with [Argus] offward starre, With [Sirus] star malicious [and noisome vnto men.] But if thou wilt labour thy land for haruest wheat [and rie] And graine both big and strong, and shakt stand vpon corne alone [And carest for none other crop] then let th' Atlantides [Those seuen] easterne [stars] be set and hidden from thee quite, And let the Gnosian star of the bright shining crowne like fire [Giuen to Ariadne] go backe from the sunnie beames] Before thou cast in furrowes long thy seedcorne due to thee, And likewise yer thou makest hast to trust th' unwilling earth With hope of yeare [increase of corne in haruest to be rept.] Many before the going downe of Maia haue begun, But them hath wheat long looked for beguild with vaine otes [wild.] Now if thou wilt sow vitches and fasels pulse little woorth, Ne wilt despise the care of len-tils of Pelusian soile, [A mouth or hauen of Nilus floud] Bootes going downe Shall giue to thee vndoubted signs [when thou shalt sow thy ground.] Begin therefore thy sowing time, and still hold on the same, Till hory frosts be halfe gone [and the spring time forward come.] [To th' end] therefore [we may discerne the seasons of the yeare] The golden sun doth rule the world measurd in certeine parts, By stars [or signs in number] twelue. Fiue zones do hold the heauen, One of the which is alwaies red with brightly shining sunne And euer scortching with the fire [aboue and next it selfe] About the which are drawne two o-ther furthest off [in place] At the right side and at the left [namely the south and north] Growne hard with yse so gray, &amp; raine [in clouds most thick and] blacke Betweene these and the middle [zone] two other [zones] there be Granted to miserable men by gift of gods [aboue] And through them both a way is cut, whereby the thwarted course And order of the signs [or stars] might turne [and moue] it selfe. Euen as the world [or globe of heauen] at Scythia riseth hie And at the tops of Riphey hils [which northerly do lie] So is it pressed downward with a fall at Lybia south: This mounteine [north in Scythia] is alwaies hie to vs, [Aboue our heads] but th' other mount that is [in Lybia south] Under our feet blacke Styx beholds and feends infernall sees. The [dragon or the] serpent huge with winding bowts and rounds Slides downe and fals in maner of a riuer or a floud [At northpole] hereby and about the two [bears] Artos [nam'd] Fearing with water of the main swift sea for to be wet: There [at the south pole] as men say, the dead time of the night Is alwaies still [and void of noise] the darknesse likewise is [Exceeding thicke] with very night it selfe all ouerspread: Or else the morning doth returne from vs [to th' Antipods] And bringeth backe againe [from them to vs] the [lightsome] day And when the sun vprising first hath breathd vpon vs [heere] There Uesper or th' euening doth kindle lateward lights. We herevpon can learne before [all] wethers [faire or fowle,] The heauen being doubtfull and we can foretell the daies Of [reaping in the] haruest time, and seasons [too] of sowing, And when it is conuenient to stir or force with ores Th' untrustie sea, and to bring downe or launch ships readie rig'd, And t'ouerthrow [or to cut vp] in woods the timely pine: Ne do we marke in vaine the ri-sings and the fals of signs, And [how] the yeare is [parted] euen in sundry seasons foure. If any time the raine tha'ts cold keeps husbandmen [at home] It's granted him [for] to dispatch, and to do many things, Which were with riddance to be done the wether being faire, The plowman whets the edge so hard of blunted culter knife, He maketh hollow botes of trees [or woodden bolls and traies] Or prints a marke vpon his beasts, or counts his heaps of graine; Others do sharpen stakes, and dou-ble horned forks [likewise] And redie make for limber vine bindings of Amerie. One while let wicker maunds or bas-kets [paniers] easly made, Be wrought and wouen with ozier rods in Bubi towne [which grow:] Another while drie at the fire your corne, and with a stone Breake it [and being throughly dride then grind it in a mill.] For surely both the law of God and man likewise doth suffer T'exercise and do some things yea euen on holidaies; No [maner of] religion hath forbidden downe to bring [Into the fields to water them] riuer or running streams, To make a fense or plat a hedge about the growing corne, To practise snares for birds, and thorns or brambles for to burne, To plunge or wash in wholsome wa-ter flocks of bleating sheepe, Oft times the driuer lodes the sides [and backe] of asse so slow, Either with oyle or apples cheape, and he returning home Brings from the towne a grindstone, or a lumpe of blackish pitch. The moone hirselfe hath giuen [to men] some luckie daies of worke, In diuerse order: [wherefore] flie and shift the first [moone] off, Pale [hell cald] Orcus and likewise [th' infernall furies too Named] Eumenides were bred and borne at that same time: And then the earth brought foorth with birth and trauell most accurst Ceus, Iapetus and cruell Tiphei [giants great] And brethren sworne and all conspird to rent in peeces heauen: Thrise did they trie and giue assay vpon mount Pelius, To lay the mountaine Ossa and forsooth on Ossa mounnt To roll the hill Olympus full of trees bedeckt with leaues. Thrise father [Iupiter] with light-nings and with thunderbolts Cast downe those hils pilde on a heape [and floong them flat to ground.] The seuenth [moone] next to the tenth is luckie and fortunat. [Or as some say the seuenteenth] and then it's very good To set [yoong] vines, and oxen be-ing taken [them] to tame, And yarne to put vnto the web [or weauers loome for cloth.] The ninth [moone] better is for flight [or running fast away] And contrary to thefts [because it maketh theeues be caught.] Things many offred haue themselues much better [to be doone] In coldish night, or when Eo-us [earlie morning star] Bedews the ground with sun new vp [or scarsly being risen] By night the stubble light, at night drie meads shall best be mowne, The moisture fresh and coole of night doth not decay or faile: And some [good husbands] watch all night, and with sharpe knife do cut In fashion like an eare of wheat drie sticks for lateward fires, [Or seruing fit for candle light] at night in winter time: His wife also refreshing hir long labour with a song, In the meane time runs through hir web with whurling shuttle [swift] Or else she boils with fire the li-quor of sweet must [new wine] And skums away with leaues the run-ning ouer of the bra- sen kettle lukewarme [on the fire seething a gentle pase] But corne [with ripenesse] red in midst of heat is best cut downe. The threshing floore also beats out the grains [alredy] dride In midst of heat [th' easlier out of their husks to fall] Plow naked then, sow naked [for] the winter slothfull is Unto the countriman: oft times [good] husbandmen enioy [Their] gotten [goods] in [time of] cold, and being merie men They make good cheere among themselues [for] gluttonous winter doth Entise [thereto] and cares consumes: euen as the mariners When as their ships [with merchandize] full fraught haue toucht the port, [Or bruzd and crusht with tempests haue arriued in the hauen,] Being ioyfull put vpon their poops garlands [of victorie.] Howbeit now it's time to shake off akorns from th' oketree Berries of baies, and oliues, and [the frutes] of bloudie myrts. Then [time] to set [your] snares for cranes, and nets for harts [or stags] To follow long-eard hares, to strike and sticke the fallow deere, And hempen strings of Spanish sling are twisted they [and vs'de] When snow lies deepe, &amp; when as flouds thrust [forward flakes of] yse, [That is, when yse doth flote and swim aloft on waters rough.] What should I speake of haruest storms, and tempests of the stars, And [of that time] when as the day is short, and gentle heat, Which must be watcht of men, or when the rainie springtime fals, When as the haruest in the eare is rough become in fields, And corne with milkie iuice fulfild doth swell in greenish stalke, Oft haue I seene the battels all of winds to run together, When as the husbandman should bring a reaper to the yel- low fields [in haruest when the winds annoy the ripened corne] And when from brittle stem he should his barley pull or cut: Which [battels of the winds] could teare the corne being full and big Quite from the very roots [the same] being tossed vp aloft: So [haue I seene when] winter [storme] did beare away the light Straw and the stubble flieng with a whirlewind blacke [and cloudie,] From heauen oft times hath falne and come vnmeasurable raine, And clouds together gathered do hurle in rounded heaps Fowle tempests mixt and tempered with blacke and mistie shoures. The highest aire doth tumble downe, and wets with mighty raine The seedcorne ranke, and labours great of oxen [at the plow] Ditches are filled vp, and hol-low flouds increase with noise: The sea also doth rage and boile with blustring storms and waues. The father of tempests himselfe doth mainly moue and raise With his right hand bright lightenings at midnight, by which force The greatest [part of all the] earth doth tremble, beasts so wild Do run away, and lowly feare hath daunted hearts of men Through nations [far and neere:] for he with flaming thunderbolt Throwes downe mount Athon, Rhodope, or else hie Ceraun hils, The southerne winds double themselues, so doth the thickest raine, Now with the mightie wind the woods and seashores make a noise. Thou fearing this marke well the months of heauen and the stars, And whether Saturns star so cold betakes it selfe [or goes,] And in what circles of the heauen Cyllenius star doth wander. First [and before all other things] worship the gods aboue, And offer thou againe to Ce-res great hir yerely sa- crifices, hauing wrought among thy rankish bladed corne, Euen at the fall or going out of winters latter end, And spring time faire now [being come] then lambs are fat, and wines Are passing pleasant, then are sleeps delightsome too and sweet, And shadowes thicke on hils. Let all thy countrie youth adore And worship Ceres, vnto whom temper and mingle thou Honie with milke and daintie wine [or wine not hard in tast] And let a sacrifice [that is, a hog, a sheepe, or cow] Fat and well liking go about the new corne [on the ground] Which [sacrifice] let all the rowt with their companions too Follow reioising, and with out-cries let them call into Their houses [ladie] Ceres [or the corne into their barns:] Ne let there any bodie put sickle to ripened corne, Before his head being compast round with writhen [garland] oke, He giue disordred danses, and sing songs to Ceres [praise] But that we might by certeine signs these matters vnderstand, Heat, raine, and winds inforcing cold, the father [Iupiter] Appointed hath what thing ech month-ly moone should tell vs of, Under what signe the southerne winds should fall [and blowing cease:] Which husbandmen perceiuing oft might keepe their heards of neat Nerer vnto their houels, or the neerer to their stals, Immediatly the winds ari-sing, or the waues of sea Being tost begin to swell, and noise of dried leaues on trees [Begin for] to be heard vpon the mounteins hie, or shores Of seas sounding far off. [Begin] troubled to be right sore, And murmuring noise of woods [begin] to grow yet more and more, The water of the sea doth bad-ly stay or spare it selfe From crooked keels of ships euen then, when as the [water foules Cald] diuers swiftly flie out of the middle of the sea, And carrie to the shore their noise [and crieng flie to shore.] And when the seamews play vpon the drie land [or the sand] And when the bittour doth forsake and leaue the well knowne fens, And flies aboue the clouds so hie [of tempests these are signs] Thou likewise oftentimes shalt see stars headlong fall from heauen, The wind them forward driuing, and long strakes of flaming fire To be come white behind thy backe with shadowes of the night: Light chaffe also and leaues [from trees] falne downe to flie about Or fethers swimming on the water top to play together. But when it lightens from the part of boisterous northerne wind, And when the house of Easterne wind, and westerne wind doth thunder, [All] countrie grounds do swim [in wet] their ditches being full, And euery mariner on sea doth gather vp his sailes Wet with the raine [that fell.] Raine to the wise did neuer hurt, [Raine neuer hath done harme to them that would forewarned be] [For] cranes flieng aloft in th' aire, or cranes skie coloured Haue shund a shoure comming or rising vp in vallies low: Or else a cow looking to heauen hath often taken aire In at hir nosetrils open wide, or else the chatting swallow [Or flickering round about a lake or pond hath often flowne; And frogs haue soong their old complaint or note in [slimie] mud, The ant or pismere fretting out a narrow way or passage, Hath often carried out hir egs from secret closet [hole] The [raine] bow big hath droonke [and sok't vp stuffe enough for raine] And eke an armie huge of crowes departing from their food, By great troups with their wings so thick haue made a flickering noise. Thou maist behold the fouls of sea, and those that [keepe in holes Or seeke in holes for meat] about the meads of Asia land, Within the standing waters [or the fens] of Caister [floud] To dash or poure vpon their shoul-ders, pinions, or their wings Large dews [or watery sprinklings] and sometime ducke their head Against the sea, and other whiles to run into the streame, And with desire to make a shew of washing all in vaine. Then cals the ceaslesse dew for raine with full voice [open throte] And ietteth by himselfe alone vpon the drie sand [shore] And his complaining head he diues in waters comming neere. And surely wenches toosing wooll [or spinning flax] by night Haue not beene ignorant of raine [but knowne before it came] When as they saw their oile to spar-kle in hot burning shell And rotten mushroms [as it were] t'arise and grow withall. No lesse maist thou foresee and know by raine and certaine signs, Trim sunnie daies and open we-ther, lightsome faire and cleere: For then it seemes no blunt aspect or sight is in the stars, Nor yet the moone beholden to hir brothers beams to rise, Nor slender fleeses thin of wooll [as thistle downe and such] By th' aire for to be carried. Th' halcyons [birds] belou'd Of Thetis [and cald kings fishers] their feathers open not Upon the shore in lukewarme sun: and the vncleanly swine Remember not to turne and tosse with wide and open mouth Bundels of straw [trusses vnbound and loose by mouth of swine] But dews fall more in vallies low, and lie vpon the feelds: The owle likewise marking the fall or setting of the sun His euening songs he vseth not from highest top of house, And Nisus [of Megera king and turned to a falcon] Capers aloft in skie so cleere, and Scylla [Nisus daughter Changed into a larke] doth smart for [his faire] purple haire, Which way soeuer flieng [from hir father] light and swift She cutteth with hir wings the aire, lo Nisus cruell fo Doth follow fast with great [adoo and] flickering noise of wings, [And looke] which way as Nisus bears himselfe vp in the skie, She shifting him so swift cuts with hir wings th' aire by and by. Then crowes do double twise or thrise out of [their] strained throte Cleere cals [or noises shrill] and glad in nestling places hie Do make a chattering oft betweene themselues among the leaues, With what sweetnesse I cannot tell contrary to their want: It doth delight them when the raine is ouerpast and gone. To looke vnto their little brood, and see their nests so sweet. I do not thinke that in them is wit heauenly from God, Or greater wisdome [and more skill] of things than nature would [I thinke not that their wit is more diuine than mens, nor that Their insight of things greater is than fate or natures saw.] But when the tempest and the wet of variable aire Haue changed their waies [be gone] and that moist [wether] Iupiter Doth thicken with the southerne winds those things that late were thin, And maketh loose or thin those things that earst were close and thicke, Then are their qualities of mind turned [as times doth change] [Then creatures reasonlesse are turnd in sundrie sorts of minds] And now their brests [or harts] conceiue affections other [wise] And other [wise] whiles winds did chase and driue away the clouds. Hereof [doth come] those songs and tunes of birds [abrode] in feelds, And cheerefull beasts, and also crowes reioising in their throte. But if thou wilt behold and looke vpon the sun so swift, And moons succeeding orderly, the houre or morrow next Shall neuer thee deceiue, ne shalt thou taken be with snares Of euening cleere or night so faire [and yet the next day fowle.] If when the moone doth gather first hir light returning backe, [That is, if when the moone is changd and in hir quarter first] She hold in duskish horne blacke aire, [lo then] raine very great Shalbe prepard for husbandmen [on land] and for the sea, But if she ouercast vpon hir face a virgins rednesse [Or blushing maidenlike] it will be wind: the golden moone Phebe is red alwaies with wind. But if she shall go cleere And [shining] bright through heauen, and not with blun-ted hornes [but sharpe] In hir fourth rising (for that quar-ter is the surest signe Of wether faire) then sure with all that whole day and [the rest] Which shall proceed and spring from it, vntill the month be out, Shall want both raine &amp; winds, and sea-men sau'd [from being drownd] Shall pay their vowes vpon the shore to Glaucus [god of sea] To Panope [a seanymph] and to Melicert Inous [A god of sea and sonne vnto the whitish goddesse Ino.] The son also shall tokens giue both rising, and likewise When he shall hide himselfe in wa-ters [at his setting too] Undoubted signs follow the sun: those things which he doth shew At mornings and which [he doth shew at night] at stars arising. When he [the sun] shall staine with spots his easterne rising vp, And hidden in a cloud shall shine with halfe his compasse round, Let raine suspected be to thee; for south vnlucky wind To trees and corne and cattell for-ceth [raine] from aire aloft. But when as sunbeames diuers [and discoloured] shall breake Themselues among thicke clouds a little while before day light; Or when Aurora [goddesse of the morning] leauing she The saffron coloured bed of Ti-tonus [hir husband deere] Ariseth pale: alacke the ten-der leaues and boughs of vines Defend the grapes but badly then [the boughs and leaues of vines Defend not then the grapes so soft, in clusters hanging ripe] So much haile ratling horribly doth leape on houses tops. It shall thee profit much also for to remember this, When he [the sun] shall set, the heauen [by him] being measured out [Hauing run ouer his hemisphere, or halfe the world by course] For colours diuers oft we see to wander in his face: Gray doth betoken raine, and fie-ry red shews easterne winds, But if the spots with shining fi-rie rednesse shall begin Mingled to be, then shalt thou see [all] places to be hot With wind and rainie storms at once [together rushing downe,] Let no man monish or aduise me in that night to go Unto the sea, nor pull vp loose the gable rope from ground, But if the circle of the sun be bright and lightsome, when He shall bring home the day, and hide the same being brought home. [If at his rising he be bright and at his setting too] Then all in vaine thou shalt be skard and fraid with stormy wether; And thou shalt see the woods with cleere northwinds for to be shaken. In breefe the sun shall giue thee signs what lateward Uesper brings, From whense the wind may driue faire clouds, &amp; what moist south may cause. Who dares say that the sun is false? the same [sun] also warns [Us] oftentimes [of] blind vprores and busie stirs at hand, And [deepe] deceipt, and hidden wars [dissembled] for to swell: He [euen the sun] did pittie Rome, Cæsar then being slaine, When as he couered his bright head with darksome duskishnesse, [Put on a mourning hood of blacke for greefe of Cæsars death] Those wicked worldlings [in whose daies so good a prince was kild] Haue feard an euerlasting night; and at that time also The earth and waters of the sea, and filthie howling curs, And [colping rauens] restlesse birds [vntimely] tokens gaue, How oft haue we seene Ætna [hill] flashing from out of bro- ken fornaces to burne amaine as far as Cyclops fields, And roll or tumble bals of fire, and stones consumde [to ashes:] Germania heard the sound of rat-ling arms all ouer heauen, The alps [mountains twixt Italie and France exceeding hie] Trembled [and shooke with quiuerings and sore] vnwoonted quakes. A mightie voice was also heard of people [euery where] Quite through the silent woods, repre-sentations pale also In manner maruellous were seene a while before darknight, And beasts spake words not to be spoke [or beasts did speake a thing Not to be told] riuers stand still grounds open wide and gape: The iuory [images] also pensiue and very sad Weepe in the temples, and the bra-sen [idols] sweat [for greefe.] Eridanus the king of flouds [in Italie well knowne] Wasted the woods winding the same about with raging rounds, And bore away beasts with their stalls cleane ouer all the feelds. Ne ceassed at the selfe same time the strings or little veines [Of boweld beasts] thretfull t'appeare in entrails sad [to see] Ne ceassed bloud from springs to flow, and townes high [built] to ring, And sound by night with howling wolues: more lightenings neuer fell At any time, the skie or we-ther being passing cleere; Nor dreadfull blazing stars so oft as then did sorely burne. Therefore [the feelds of Thessalie] [named] Philippie saw The Romane armies yet againe among themselues to fight, And skirmish all with equall we-pons? [as with persing darts Or iauelins, of the Romans old th' inuading furniture] Ne was it of the gods vnwor-thie [thought] that Emathie [Or Macedonie] and the feelds so large of Hyemus [hill] Should twise wax fat with [Roman bloud], our bloud [in battell shed] And know you this, the time will come when as the husbandman Haing turnd vp the ground with croo-ked plow in those same quarters, Shall find darts eaten [sore and gnawne] with rough and rugged rust, Or with his heauie harrow he shall emptie helmets hit And at the bones so great in graues digd vp [found out, or hurt] He shall much maruell [seeing them so big, and ours so small.] O natiue countrie gods now dei-fide and made eternall, And thou O Romulus and thou [his] mother Vesta, which Doost saue and keepe the Tuscan [floud] Tiber: and doost preserue The Romane palaces; forbid not [hinder not] at least This youth to succour and vphold the world turnd vpside downe. We now a long time with our bloud haue satisfied and paid Enough for the [fowle] periurie of Troy Laomedont, [Of Troy whereof Laomedon for sworne was sometime king] O Cæsar, O the royall court of heauen beare vs grudge. This many a day for thee, and doth complaine [and plainly say] That thou regardest triumphs and victorious shewes of men, Sith lawfull and vnlawfull [both] are turnd [and thought all one] So many warrs through out the world, so many sorts of sins, No honor worthie of the plow [the plow in no account] The fallows they be fowle [vntrimd] the husbandmen [from plow] Being lead or drawne away perforce [to bloudie ciuill warrs] And crooked syths or sickles in-to swords so stif be forged. On this side stirs Euphrates war, and Germanie on that, The neighbour towns beare armes among themselues, lawes being broken, Most wicked Mars doth tyrannize and rage in all the world; As when foure horsses in a coch haue floong themselues from bar, And gaue themselues into the race, the cochman pulling in The stayes or holds in vaine, is ca-ried quite away with horsse, Ne doth the coch giue eare or heare the rains [but set them light.] The second booke of Virgils Georgiks written to Mecenas, &amp;c. The argument of Modestinus a lawyer vpon the second booke of Virgils Georgiks or husbandrie for Italie. He [namely Virgil hitherto hath soong [or shewed in verse] The tillage of the fallow feelds, and also stars of heauen, [Now heere in this his second booke] he sings [or speaketh of] Uines bearing leaues and branches too, and hills all greene with trees, And vines appointed, ordred, set in places [fit to grow] And gifts of Liey [Bacchus] wines banish rare and greefe] And so in order sappie boughs of oliues and frutetrees [Or oliue boughs chosen out of a rowe of frutefull trees, Or boughs of frutes of oliue tree in faire and comely sort.] Thus for the husbanding of fal-low feelds, and stars of heauen, Now thee O Bacchus will I sing, and with thee trees in woods, And frute of oliues growing slowe O father [Bacchus thou Lenæus [named so of wine-presses which thou mainteinst] Come hither: all things heere are full replenisht with thy gifts, The feelds well stord and chargd with har-uest vinetree boughs and leaues, Doth flourish for thy sake, the vin-tage fomes with filled lips; Come hither father O Lenæus and dip in with me Thy naked legs in sweet new wine, thy buskins pulled off. In primis trees already growne [in making trees to grow] Nature is diuerse: for some [trees] come vp themselues [alone] Euen of their owne accord, no man compelling them [thereto] And they [possesse and] hold at large the feelds and crooked streames [Or water banks:] as namely the soft willow, bending broome, Poplar and horie osier sets, with leaue of greenish graie: Some [other] sort of trees also rise vp out of the seed, As chestnuts tall and Esculus which beareth leaues for Ioue, The greatest trees in all the woods [or growing most in woods] And okes accounted oracles of and amongst the Greekes. A very thicke wood springeth vp of others from the root As cherrie trees and elms and baies of Parnasse hill [for Phæbe] [Which] being litle [or but yoong] doth cast [or list it selfe] Up vnder shadow great of mo-ther [namely beggers baies] Nature gaue first these meanes of trees [to make them spring &amp; sprowt.] All sortes of woods and shrubs likewise, and hollow groues also, Doe greenely grow with these [same means of natures owne prouiding.] Some other [means] also there be which [proofe or] vse it selfe Hath found by way [of reasons rule.] This man from tender body Of mothers [elder trees] cutting [some plants or imps hath laid Or put them into furrows [fit, but yet] another man Hath buried in the ground the stocks or truncks [with roots and all,] And trunchions cleft in peeces foure, and stakes of sharpened oke. Some other woods doo looke [to haue] the strained bendings of The vine, and quicksets in or with their owne [or natiue] soile; Some other need no root at all. The lopper of the tree He bearing home [a twig or impe from] highest top of tree, Doubts not to put it in the ground. Moreouer th' oliue root Is thrust [vp also in the growth] euen out of wood so drie, The stocks or truncks being cut: a thing most woonderfull to tell. And oftentimes we see the boughs of one tree turne into [The nature] of another with-out perill [hurt or losse] The peare tree changed for to beare apples grafted thereon, And stonie cornells to wax red with damsens or with plums. Wherfore go to O husbandmen and learne the proper dressing [Of trees] in genrall [or each one in his especiall kind] And so often [or make pleasant] their wild frutes by skilfull trimming, Ne let your grounds lie idle [waste.] Yet doth [a man] delight To plant [mount] Ismarus with Bacchus [vinetrees vowd to him] And for to cloath great Taburne [hill] with frutefull] oliue trees. And thou O my Mecenas [thou most worthie gentleman] My honor, and by thy desert most part of our renowme, Assist me, aid me, and run through together [now] with me This labour new begun, and flieng giue the wide sea sailes [Thou flieng, making hast with me, giue this my worke good speed] (I wish not to conteine all things within these verses mine, Not if to me a hundred toongs, and mouths a hundred were, An iron voice) and gather vp the waues of the first shore In th' hands of th' earth [euen now at my] beginning enter thou Into this great discourse of trees with me, wherin we will Not treat of euery thing at large, but touch them all in breefe. I will not hold thee heere with fai-ned verses, ne [keepe thee] With doubtfull words, nor with begin-nings large [and full of length] [Those things] which of their owne accord lift vp themselues [&amp; spring] Into the aire of light [or light-some aire] arise and grow Indeed vnfrutefull; neretheles they are both ranke and strong, Bicause [the force of] nature is within the soile or ground: Howbeit if that any man doo these same also graft, Or being changed put them in to diches digd [or made] They will cast off their nature wilde, and so with trimming oft Will follow nothing slowe vnto what practise thou canst call them. The barren [tree] also which goes and growes from roots below Will doo the same, if it be drest in void [and sunnie] feeldes. Sometimes high leaues and branches of the mother [or old tree] Doo ouer shadow and beereaue the growing [plant] of fruite, And bearing mares it vtterly. For why, a tree that hath Heau'd vp it selfe [and risen] out of seeds cast [in the ground] Coms slowly vp to make a shade for lateward Nephues [sake] [It will be long yer they beare frute, and longer time before [There come from them large spreding boughs wherewith to make a shade.] And apples grow quite out of kind, forgetting former iuce, And grapes [or vines] a prey doo beare for birds euen clusters fowle Know therefore that vpon all [trees] labour must be bestowd, And all trees to be brought into a trench, and to be tam'd, [Or trimd] with great reward [or gaine to him that takes the pains.] But oliue trees content [vs] best with [their owne proper] stocks, Uines with their former stocke [well prund the better grapes to beare] Mirtles of Paphos ile, [or giuen to Venus Paphian queene] Out of the verie maine stocke grow, and hazell trees so hard, [Or hardles and soone broken grow] of plants or tendersets. The mightie ash, and shadie tree of Hercles garland [greene] [The poplar tree] and father Cha-on [Ioue] his wallnut trees, The palme [or date tree] high [all these] spring vp of plants or sets: So doth the fir tree, which shall see the falls of wauing seas. But yet the rugged wilding [or the crab stocke rough] is grafted With th' impe or plant of nut tree, and the barren planetree [stocks] Haue carried apple trees much woorth, [profitable and good] And chestnuts [stocks] haue borne the grafts of] beech; and ashen [stocke] Hat horie waxt with blossome white of peare tree [planted on] And swine haue also crasht and bro-ken akorns vnder elmes. Ne is there but one fashion or one way alone to graft And to inoculat or set yoong imps into the stocke, For in what part the budds thrust out themselues amidst the barke, And breake the thin and tender rinde [in place where it appears] There is a little narow hole made [like vnto an ey] Euen in the very knot, into this hole they [put] the impe [Cut] from another tree, and close it vp within the same And teach it to begin to grow with [th' inward] rind so moist: Or else the knotles trunks are cut againe, and way with wedges Is deeply clift into the maine stocke, and then afterwards The frutefull sets are put therein; and long time [being past] A mightie tree hath sproong thereout to heauen with frutefull branches And wondreth at her new greene leaues, and frutes none of hir owne. Beside all this, there is not one [but diuers] kind [of grafting] Upon strong elms nor willow [stocks] nor Lotus nor vpon The cypresses of Ida [hill:] ne doo fat oliue berries Grow all alike, or after one and selfe same sort [on trees] The codlike oliues, with the long and rounded oliues, and The fleshie oliue [full of meat] with bitter berrie, and [All frutes or] apples, and the woods of king Alcinous, [The king of the Pheacians, they grow not all alike] Ne is there one and selfe same impe for Crustume peares, and eeke For Syrian peares, and [peares so] great [which wardens we doo call] Not one and selfe same vintager hangs on our [Italian] trees, [The grapes] which Lesbian [vintager] doth crop from Methym vine, The Thasian vines, the vine tree white of Mareotides, These able are for rankish soile, those fit for leaner ground: And Psythian vines more profita-ble be for raisons [sweet] Lageos grape subtill and thin will trie, the [tasters] feet, And tie his toong in time [the iuce so persing is and strong] And there be purple coloured grapes and sooner ripe than others, And grapes of Rhetia vine, of thee in what verse shall I speake? Contend not then with cellars [full] of Falerne [plesant] wines. There be likewise Aminian vines, wines very strong [they yeeld] Unto with vines mount Tmolus doth [most reuerently] arise And king Phaneus his owne selfe [with all his wines of cheife.] There is a litle whitish grape, wherwith none will contend Either to yeeld so much [of iuce] or last so many years. And O thou grape of Rhodos [ile] receiued of the gods In second seruice [all among their dishes banketting] I may not ouerpasse thee; nor O thee Bumasthe [vine] With clusters of thy grapes big blowne, puft vp and fully swolne But it is to no purpose [here to shew] how many sorts [Of vines or wines] there he, nor what the names of them might be. There is a number of them, but it makes not any matter In number to conteine them: which he that [so faine] would know, The selfe same fellow [faine] would learne how many sands [on shore] Of Lybian sea are tost and turnd with [puffing] westerne wind: Or else to know how many waues of the Ionian sea Doo come to shore when violent ea-sterne wind doth follow ships, Ne truly can all grounds [bring forth and] beare all [kind of] things; The willows grow in riuers, and in fens full thicke grow alns The barren ash on stonie hills, and shores are passing glad Of places set with mirtle trees: and to be short [the vine] Bacchus doth loue well open hills [open against the sun] Ewgh trees [doo loue] the northerne wind and wether that is cold. Behold the world like to a ball [the earth in compasse round] Tamed by the husbandmen which dwell in furthest parts thereof, And eeke th' Arabians easterne hou-ses, and the painted [folks Of Scythia calld] Geloni and thou shalt perceiue and see That natiue soiles diuided be [and sorted] vnto trees. For India only and alone doth beare blacke Hebenum, And twigs of frankincense [belong] to the Sabeis alone, Wherto should I rehearse to thee balme sweating out of wood Most sweet in smells? and berries of [the shrub] Achantus al- Waies bearing [greenish] leaues? wherto should I rehearse likewise] Th' Aethiopian woods growne horie gray with [cotton] soft [or] wooll, And how the [people] Seres doo both combe and card away Fine fleeces from the leaues [fine stuffe whereof our silke is made] Or what thicke woods the neerer Inde vnto the Ocean sea, A coast [or portion] of the world hense furthest off doth beare, Where arows none could ouer come by casting [out of bowe] The aire most hie with trees [whose tops no shaft could flie vnto,] And sure that people is not slowe with quiuers caught [to shoot.] The countrie Media beareth sowre and sharpish iuces, and A taste vntoothsome blunt and dull of wholsome cytron pome, Than which no readier [remedie] more present come [to hand] If cruell stepdames poisoned haue the pots at any time, And mingled herbs and witching words [or hurtfull charms withall] And this [pome citron] doth [expell and] driue out of the lims And members [of infected folks] vile venem blacke [like cole:] The tree it selfe is great, and is in fashion like the bay, And if it did not cast farre off another kind of smell It were a bay, the leaues not fal-ling off with any windes: The floure thereof is passing fast. The Medians nourish life, [Or vse it for a comfort when they swoone or chance to faint] And stinking breaths doo helpe, and heale old broken winded men. But yet the Medians woods, a ground [or countrie] verie rich, Nor Ganges faire [of India land a riuer great of name] Nor Hermus [streame in Meonie] troubled with gold [en sands] May not contend or striue in prai-ses [due to] Italie. Not Bactra [soile in Scythia] nor yet the Indies [twaine] And all Panchaia fat with sands which frankincense doo beare, Bulls breathing at their nosetrils fire haue not allowd these places, Nor with the teeth of Hydra huge [fowle adders teeth] them fowne, Ne haue the feeld of corne growne rough [or hideous to behold] With helmets thicke and speares of men [in armor fitt to fight] But frutes abundant, and of Bac-chus [wine] the Massike iuce [Or liquor of Campania hill] haue filled Italie: The oliue trees and lustie herds of cattell do possesse it. From hense the tall and warlike horsse betakes him to the feeld, And O Clitumnus [riuer cleere] white flocks [of cattell fat] The bull, the greatest sacrifice [in triumphs made to Ioue] Well washed and clensd through with thy sacred [holie water] Haue often brought from hense vnto the temples of the gods The Roman triumphs: heere the spring continuall is, and heere Is summer time in others months [when winter is elswhere] The cattell twise are great with yoong, the tree is twise [a yeere] For apples [and for other frutes] profitable [and good.] But tigers swift [or rauenous and raging mad] from hense Are far away; so be the cru-ell seed [or whelps] of lions, Nor Aconites doo not deceiue the sillie gatherers, Nor skaled snake doth force vpon the ground great rounds or rings, Ne gathers vp himselfe in com-passe with so great a length [As other where, in Affrica in Aegypt, and] such like.] Ioine [thereunto] so many ci-ties rare and excellent, And labour too of workes [that is of handicrafts and trades] So many townes heapt vp with hand of rough and broken stones, And floods or riuers vnder flow-eng th' old and ancient walls Why should I reckon vp the sea [surnamed Adrian] Which washeth [Italie] aboue, [eastward to Uenice] or [The sea surnamed Tyrrhen] which doth wet the same beelow, [Westward to Anne? Italie betweene two seas doth lie] Or [should I recon] lakes so great? O Larius greatest [lake] And thee Benacus rising vp with flouds and sea-like rage? Or should I hauens heere recount, or closures, [stops and letts] Ioyned and set to Lucrine lake by Iulius Cæsar drift?] Or [tell how] that the sea became displeasd and moued sore [Bicause his current was cut short] with noise and rorings great, [Euen there] where Iulian streams sound far with sea powrd in againe, And where the flowing Tyrrhen sea is let into' Auerne streicts. This selfe same [Italie] doth shew [faire] draines of siluer, and In vains [of th' earth] meatals of brasse, and floweth much with gold. This [Italie] aduanced hath an egar kind of men The Marses and the Sabell youths; and the Ligurians Accustomed to wickednes [enur'd to labour hard] The Volces also bearing darts [or sppuds in shape like spits] The Decies, Maries, and the great Camillies [gentlemen] The Scipios hardie [stowt] in warre, and the most mightie Cæsar, Who being conqueror euen now in Asias furthest coasts, Doost turne away th' unwarlike Inde from territors of Rome O Saturns land [our Italie] great mother thou of fruites, Great [mother thou] of men, all haile: [Salue, well maist thou fare,] I enter for thy sake on things of old and ancient praise, And of good skill, being bold t'vnshut or open holie springs, [Or founteins of the Muses, or of sacred things the secrets,] And through the townes of Rome I sing th' Ascrean [poets] verse. Now place [is fit] for qualities of fallows [to be showne] What strength in euery one there is what colour [they they be of] And what their [proper] nature is in bringing forth of things. In primis hard and barren grounds, and naughtie hillocks too, Where clay is thin and weake, [and in] the bushie [thornie] fields, Where [many] grauell stones [be thwackt] take pleasure and delight, [Reioise] in woods of long liu'd O-liue tree by Pallas [found] The wild or bastard Oliue tree rising most plentifull In selfe same coast [for tract of land] a token is hereof: So are the feelds scattered and spred with [o-liue] beries wild. But ground thats fat and also ranke with iuce or moisture sweet, And feelds well stored with greene grasse, and fruitfull with increase, (Such as we woonted are to see in mounteins hollow dales) Hither [to them] are streams draind downe from hie &amp; steepie rocks, And they draw prosperous mud with them [into the vallies low.] A feeld also which lies aloft against the southerne wind, And which doth feede and cherish ferne, enuide of crooked plow; This [feeld] sometimes shall giue to thee sufficiently strong vines, And flowing with much wine: this [feeld] is frutefull of the grape And of the liquor [in the grape] such as we offer in Brode drinking bols and gold [of gold or golden drinking cups] When Tyrhen [piper] fat hath blowne his yuorie pipe by th' altar, And when we do present the smo-king bowels in brode platters. But if so be thy mind be more to take a charge to keepe [Some] heards of beasts and calues, or else the yoonglings of the sheepe Or little gotes burning thy sets of vines or other trees, [Bicause what thing soeuer they do bite it dries and dies] Then get thee vnto vplands [and to grounds] a great way hense Of Tarent [towne in Italie] exceeding plentifull; Or such a feeld as Mantua infortunat hath lost: [A feeld] feeding in grassie floud or riuer snow white swans; Cleere running water springs, for sheepe nor pastures [there] do want, And where the coldish dew restores so much in shortest night, As heards of beasts will crop and eat in longest [summers] day. Earth almost blacke and fat [withall] vnder the plow prest in, Whose moold also is rotten (for we follow this in plowing) Is best for corne: thou shalt not see more wains depart [or go] From any feeld [or champion ground] home with their oxen slow. Or else [that land is good for graine] from whense the [husbandman Or] plowman being angry [with the barren trees there growing] Hath carried quite away the woods, and vtterly destroid The idle groues [vnthriftie and vnfrutefull] many yeares: And he hath turned vp and wa-sted by the lowest roots The houses old of birds, the same haue fled aloft [in th' aire] Their nests being left. But land vntild, or barren ground and leane Hath had good liking [or hath loo-ked horie white] a while After the plow hath beene thrust in [and driuen thereinto] For truly hungry grauell ground of vpland country soile Doth scarse afford low Casia [flours] and dew vnto the bee. The rough [and hollow] Tophie [stone] the chalkie [soile likewise] Eaten with [vermins] Chelidres blacke [skind, are such vile things As diuers writers] do deny that any other feelds Beare food as well for serpents as yeeld crooked holes to them. That [ground] which breatheth out a va-por thin [or little mist] And [reeking] smokes soone vanishing, and drinketh moisture vp, And of it selfe doth giue againe [or waxeth wet and moist] And which doth alwaies cloth it selfe with greene grasse of it owne, Ne hurts the yron [of the plow] with scabbednesse and with Salt rustinesse [for rust and yron is as it were the scab] That ground hath wrapt &amp; wrought in it elmetrees with pleasant vines, The same is frutefull of the o-liue tree, and thou shalt trie By tilling it [how] kindly both for castell, and [withall] [How] patient of the culture knife or crooked shares [it is.] Rich Capüa [countrie] ploweth such [a soile] so doth the coast Neere neighbor to Ueseuus hill, and so doth Clanius [streame] Iniurious too Acerre void [of people there to dwell.] Now will I tell thee how thou maist know euery kind of ground. If thou doost seeke to vnderstand if it be thin, or else Aboue and out of measure thicke: because the one doth loue And fauour corne, th' other Bac-chus [vine trees yeelding wine] The thickest fauours Ceres more, each thinnest likes Lycus, First and afore [all other thinges] thou oft shalt take the place In [both thine] eies [thou shalt suruey or view it ouer all] And shalt command a pit to be digd deepe in firmest ground, And shalt put in the mould againe, and with thy feet shalt plane Or euen make [and tread] the sands] which vppermost [do lie] If sands shall want to fill it vp, then is the soile but] thin, And fitter yeeld it is for beasts and nourishable vines. But if they shall denie [and say] they cannot go againe Into their places, and the di-ches filled vp againe There shall remaine earth ouerplus [then sure] the soile is thicke, [There] looke for lingring clods [for clods requiring labour long.] In ridges grosse cut vp or plow this ground with oxen strong. But saltish soile and that which is auouched [to be] bitter Unfrutefull is for corne; the same by plowing doth not wax The milder [or the handsommer] nor doth preserue and saue A stocke for Bacchus [for the vine] nor other frutes their names. That soile shall giue [thee] such a signe, and [therefore] take them downe From smokie house tops baskets of thicke wicker, and likewise The cullinders or strayners of the presses [crushing grapes.] Here let that naughtie soile and wa-ters sweet from out of springs Be troden brimfull: then know this, the water euery whit Will struggle or gush out, the big-ger drops will go betweene Or through the wickers. But the tast [so] plaine and manifest [Of soile] will make or giue a shew [what qualitie it hath:] The bitternesse [thereof] also shall writh the triers mouths Displeasd with seeking it; [and shall with bitter smacke thereof Uncomfortable make the lookes of people tasting it.] What ground also is battable [or fat and lustie soile] By this means to be short we learne: it neuer crumbs away Being tost and turned much with hands [much handled moolders not] But waxeth clammy [and doth cleaue] with handling to the fingers In maner of [or like to] pitch. Wet ground doth feed much grasse, And is more ranke than needs or ought; fie, let not the same be Too frutefull or too battable for me [to serue my turne,] Ne let it shew [or want] it selfe [too free] or ouerstrong In first appearing-ears of corne [or comming vp in blade.] [Ground] which is heauie, and [the ground] that's light bewraies it selfe Being silent, by the very weight: an easie thing it is To learne a forehand [or foretell] the blacke [earth] by the eye, And what soeuer colour is [thereon.] But to search out The cold most mischeefous, it is a matter very hard: Only the pitch-trees and the noi-some Ewghtrees, or sometimes The iuies blacke shew openly the tokens of the cold [What ground is cold: and thus far of the qualities of grounds.] These [former] things considered, remember thou to season [With heat and cold] the moold, and in-to diches [for] to cut Great hils, and [for] to shew vnto the northerne wind the clods Of earth turnd vpward, long before thou dig or put in ditch The pleasant kind of vine. The fal-low fields are best, the mould [Thereof] being rotten: this do winds and cold hore frosts procure, And deliuer sturdie stirring fur-longe [acres] made to fall. But if that any watchfulnesse hath not escap't some men, They seeke a likely place wherein the planting first for trees May be prouided, and whereto the same growne vp in order May be remooued by and by; least that the sets being shifted Upon the sudden should not know their dam or mother soile. Moreouer [skilfull graffers] print or make vpon the barke Of tree to be displast, the coast or quarter of the heauen, How euery [tree] should stand, and on what side it should abide The southerne heats, and which should turne his backe against the north: Let [grafters] as they tooke it vp, so set it new againe, Sith it is much in tender [years] to grow into a custome. First secke if it be best on hils or planes to plant thy vines, If thou shalt measure feelds of fat and lustie champion grounds, [Then] set them thicke, in thicker yeeld the vine is not the slower, [It answereth the nature of the soile where it is set.] But if [thou measure] vpland ground with hillocks [therevpon] And mounteins steepe and clambering; take heed and see to order, [That in due order they be set] nor otherwise should all And euery way [or row of trees] in quadrant maner set [Foure square like to a quadrangle] the trees being placed so With passage ouerthwart cut out [or made betweene each row:] As when an armie long hath oft inlargd in battell maine Their bands, and in the open feeld a warlike troupe hath stood, The hosts directed be [the campe is pitcht] and all the ground Quakes all abrode with brasen wea-pons fighting face to face, [Shine all abrode with glistering ar-mor made of copper, brasse] Ne meddle not as yet with dread-full skirmishes, but doubt- full Mars [or war vncerteine] wan-ders in the midst of arms. Let all [your] plants be measured by euen counts of rows, Not that the sight [thereof] alone might feed vaine [idle] minds, But for bicause th' earth otherwise will not giue equall force [Or nourishment] vnto all trees, ne will their boughs be able To spread and stretch themselues vnto a void and empty place. Thou maist perhaps demaund what depths in diches there should be? I may be bold in furrow small to plant or set a vine: But deeper and within the ground a tree is fastned downe, The Escul first which reacheth with his roots as far as hell, As with hir top to airie skies: therefore not winters [cold] Not wind nor raine do plucke it vp, vnstird it doth remaine, And conquereth or ouercoms by lasting many yeares, Rolling [before it and outgrowing] many an age of men. She middlemost bears vp the sha-dow great [of branches big] Ne plant thou hazels among vines, ne take the highest twigs, Nor breake away from tree the lof-tiest shouts or sprigs of all. The loue of th' earth it is so great [that nearer things do grow The frutefuller they be,] nor do thou any hurt vnto The grafts with blunted yron toole, ne plant thou stocks so wild Of oliue tree [among the vines and other trees of frute.] For fire doth happen oftentimes when shepheards heedlesse [be] Which hidden first vnder the fat barke [of the oliue tree] Doth stealingly catch hold vpon the trunke or stocke [thereof] And scaping out into the leaues aloft, hath giuen a great And mightie noise vp to the aire: from thense it followes on [Preuailing or] a conqueror through boughs, and rules [the rost] Through highest tops of trees, and wraps the whole wood in his flames, And being thicke with pitchie soot, flings vp into the aire A blackish cloud [of smoke] espe-cially if that a storme From [northerne] pole [or ouerhead] hath lien vpon the woods, And blowing blasts doth wind the flames [in roundels like a ring.] Where or when as this coms to passe th' oliues are not able To spring againe out of the stocke, and being cut cannot Restored be [or rise afresh] in low ground [as before] And so th' vnfrutefull oliue wild [or bastard oliue tree] Dooth ouergrow with bitter leaues [the right ones being kild.] Nor let not any maister of experience so wise Persuade thee for to stir the stiffe soile, when the northwind blowes; Then winter shuts and closeth vp with frost the countrie ground, Ne suffereth the root growne whole to fasten in the moold, [After] the seed [is] cast [abrode, or sowne in the same.] Best planting is for vinetrees in the ruddie time of spring, When whitish bird [the storke is come] hated of adders long, Or else a while before the first cold dews of haruest [come] When as the sun so swift [or draw-ing waterish vapors vp] Hath not as yet toucht winter with his horsses [is not entred Into the line or signes of heauen, which bring in winter season] And when hot summer now is past. The spring is passing good For leaues [of trees] the spring is pas-sing kindly for the woods, And in the spring [all] grounds do well and couet breeding seeds, Bicause th' almightie father [Ioue, or comfortable aire] Dooth then come downe into the lap or bosome of his wife Glad [Iuno, or the cheerefull earth] with frutefull showres of raine: And he great [Ioue] being ioyned with his body great to th' earth] Doth nourish all the yoong [increase and broode of euery thing.] Then wailesse twigs [in woods] doo ring or sound with singing birds, And cattell then on certaine daies ingender with their kind, The nourishable field brings foorth, and fallowes slacke their laps [Or open their close passages] to lukewarme westerne winds, Soft iuice or moisture ther's enough remayning for all things, And grasse plots dare commit themselues in trust to new sun [shines:] Ne doth the vine tree branch or leafe feare rising southerne winds, Or driuen showres of raine from heauen with big north blustring blasts; But thrusteth out the buds, and all the leaues it yeeldeth out, I might suppose none other daies [or suns than these] t'haue shone In first beginning of th' increa-sing world, or to haue had Another course: that which was then was springtime, then the great Huge world kept holy day the spring; and then the easterne winds Did spare their winters blasts, when first beasts drew [or saw] the light, And th' yron ofspring [age] of men lift vp or heau'd the head Out of the fallowes [stonie] hard: wild beasts were put in woods, And stars in heauen; neither could things tender and but young Abide this labour, if so great a quietnesse went not Twixt cold and hot, and that the calm-nesse of the gentle aire Did not receiue and interteine the earth [from hurts and harms.] That which remains [is to be markt] what imps soeuer thou Shalt plant or set, spread thou the same with the fat doong [of beasts] And mindfull [of thy worke] them hide and couer much with moold, And burie or put in [with] vines into the selfe same trench] Some soking grauell stones, or else foule slimie shels [of fish] For water will betweene them fall, and airie breathings thin Will downward go or sinke therein; and so the sets or imps Will lift vp courage [or take hart:] now [men] are [redie] found Who should with stones and with the weight of [broken] shards great [store] Upon it, force it downe: this is a safegard or defense Against the raine pourd out [of clouds:] this is [a good defense] When dogstar bringing heat doth cleaue the gaping grounds with drought The plants being placed orderly to resteth downe to draw Earth oftentimes vnto [their] heads, and [therevpon] to cast Or hit the pickforks hard [with yron to breake the lumps of earth] Or till and t'occupie the ground vnder the plow thrust in, And guide the strugling oxen iust betweene the vinetree plots, Then [afterwards] to fit [thereto] smooth canes and poles of byrch Peeld or vnbarkt, and ashen stakes, and also two hornd forks. By strength whereof the [vines] may vse [or practise] vp to clime, And to despise the winds, and trace or follow woodden spars Through tops of elms [upon which spars the vine might shoot &amp; spread] And whiles y? first age grows w? new leaues [whiles the vines be yong] [Then] must you spare the tender twigs: &amp; whiles the rankish branch Doth raise it selfe aloft to heauen, shot vp through aire so cleare With raines or bridle loose: the edge of hedgebill may not yet Be tride or vsde, but branches to be cropt with crooked hands [Or fingers bowed like a hooke] and to be gathered in The very midst [not by ad-uenture but by speciall choise.] Then afterwards when as the boughs hauing imbrast and wrapd With stronger sprigs the trees of Line, shall ranklie flourish out, Then plucke away hir leaves, and pare away hir arms [or boughs] They feare before [they spring] the knife of yron: to be short Then practise thou hard gouernment, and branches shooting out Restraine, keepe vnder bridle them [with vse of grafting knife.] Moreouer hedges must be made and wouen in and out, And cattell of all kinds within the same are to be kept, Especially whiles that the [vine] leaues tender be and yoong, And ignorant [vnexercisd] of inconueniences, [As winds and haile, bitings of beasts, breakings, and other like] The which vineleaues wild buffes and per-secuting gotes also Annoy and hurt; beside th' vngentle winter [season sharpe] And sun [in summer] vehement. Sheepe feed [vpon the vines] And so doo greedie heifers too: the cold growne hard together With hory frost, or extreame heat lieng on thirstie rocks, Haue not done so much hurt [to vines] as those same flocks haue done, And as the venim of their teeth so hard, and as the skar Markt in the bitten stocke [which is the very spoile thereof.] The gote is kild on altars all to Bacchus, for this fault, And ancient plaies which enter on the scaffold or the stage, And also the Athenians about their bigger towns And meetings of the common waies haue set downe a reward, [Namely a gote] and merry they among their quaffing cups Haue danst in medowes soft among their bottels sokt [with wine.] Th' Ausonian [or Italian] hus-band men, a nation sent From Troy, make sport with homely rimes and laughter lowd vnstaid, They take ilfauourd vizards made of hollow barks of trees, And call vpon thee Bacchus with their merrie songs and tunes And hang vp little [counterfets] soft faces [made of clay] Upon a tall pineapple tree. Then herevpon [when as The sacrifices ended be] the vineyard all doth spring And flourisheth with great increase: the hollow vallies and The mountains tall are filled full [of vines and places all] Which way soeuer god hath turnd his honourable head. Wherefore to Bacchus we will sing his praise and glory duly In natiue countrie songs [and tunes all in the Latine toong] And sacrificing vessels we will bring, and holy cakes: A gote also lead by the horne for sacrifice shall stand At thalter, and will rost his bow-els fat on hazell spits. Moreouer that same toile in trimming vines is otherwise, Upon the which enough of pains is neuer [ill] bestowd: For euery soile must euery yeare be plowd three times or foure, And clods must alwaies broken be with pickforks turnd therein; And euery groue or wood must be disburthend of his boughs, Labour returns to husbandmen in compasse driuen round, As is the yeares rold in it selfe by traces of it owne: [First spring, then summer, haruest, win-ter last; then spring againe. And now when as the vine at last hath cast his lateward leaues, And cold northwind hath beaten off the beautie from the woods; Euen then doth sturdie countriman reach out his du regard Unto the yeare next comming; and doth persecute or proine With crooked tooth of Saturne [with a hooked graffing knife] The vinetree let alone awhile, by shredding of the same, And fashions it or makes it trim by cutting [off the wast.] First dig the ground, first burne the twigs conueid and borne away, And first beare home into thy house the [vinetree] props or stakes, Gather thy grapes or vintage last: the shadow [of the leaues] [Inuadeth] commeth forceably on vines twise in the yeare, And weeds do hide or couer twise the yoong or tender sets With brambles thicke: [each toyle is great] both labours hard &amp; sore. Commend and praise large countrie grounds, plow little land [for crop] Moreouer sharpish twigs or rods of Ruscum [that same shrub.] Is lopt or cut throughout the woods, and reeds on riuers sides, And care of willow plots vnset keepes husbandmen at worke. Now vines are bound [to poles] and trees lay graffing knife aside, [And will be proind no more] now saplesse [lustlesse] vintager, Dooth praise in song his outmost rowes of vinetrees downe at last. But yet the soile must tempered be, and stird must be the dust, And Iupiter [the wether] is of ripe grapes to be feared. Contrariwise no trimming is on oliue trees [bestowd] Ne looke they for vs [or wish to haue] the crooked grafting knife, Nor weeding hookes hauing sure hold when once they sticke in ground And can abide the wether [or the wind] the earth it selfe When it is opened with a croo-ked toole [mattocke or spade] Moisture it giues sufficient to tender planted imps, And when [the same is tild] with plow, great store of corne [it yeelds] Nourish herewith the peaceable and fattish oliue tree, And apple [trees] also so soone as they haue felt their stocks Able ynough and haue their strength; they suddenly shoot vp By their owne force vnto the stars, not needing [once] our helpe. No lesse doth all the groue wax great with frute in the meane while, And birds abidings all vntrimd are red with bloudie berries; The Cythise shrub shall lopped be for cattell, and the wood So hie affoordeth gummie sticks or chips [in sted of candels] [Wherwith] night fiers are fed and kept, and cast out glittering lights; And men doo doubt to set those trees, and care on them bestow. What should I follow greater things? the willowes and lowe broome Giue largely either vnto beasts greene leaues, or shades to shepherds, And hedges, vnto planted plots, and meat [to bees for] honie. It doth also delight to looke vpon Cytorus hill Abounding all with box and woods of Narice pitchtrees [too] And eeke to see the feelds be hol-den neither to the rakes Or harrowes of the husbandmen, nor anie care of theirs. The barren woods themselues on Cau-case [loftie mounteine] top, Which violent east wind breake and shake, doo daily render frute, Some this, some that; and they dod yeeld most profitable timber. Pinetrees for ships, reders and cy-pres trees for dwelling houses. Hense [out of these] haue husbandmen framed by torners tools Spokes for their wheels, &amp; eeke from hense [haue] couerings for their carts, And ther haue put bowd bottoms. [crooked keels] in botes or ships. With oziers are the willowes full: with leaues doo elms [abound] But mirtle with strong speares or poles, and Cornell good for warre, Ewghs wrought and wrested be into Ithyrian [shooting] bowes; The tilces smooth or box tree wood with torners toole soone shauen. Take fashion, and are hollow made with sharpened iron toole. Moreouer th' alnetree light being sent from Padus [riuer] banke Doth flote or swim on wauing streames; and bees doo also hide Their swarms in th' hollow barkes and bel-lie of the rotten holme. What other thing as well worthie to be rehearst and told Haue Bacchus gifts [the vinetrees] borne? Bacchus [or wine] hath giuen Occasion of offense and blame, he tamed hath with death The Centaurs droonken mad, Rhetus, Pholus, and Hyleus Threatning the Lapiths with a mightie wineball [in his hand.] O too too happie husbandmen if they their goods could know To whome the earth most iust dooth yeeld farr off from discords arms Out of the ground on easie life [or vittels lightly got:] Though loftie house with stately doors spews out of euery roome. A streame most huge [or prease] of folks them greeting in the morning, Ne gape they greedie after posts in diuerse order deckt, With arched roofe [or seeling] faire, and garments guilefully Wouen with gold, and Ephyre-an [or Corinthian] place; Neither is white wooll stained with Assirian purple die, Nor vse of clarified oile with Casie is corrupt; But careles quietnes, and life vnskilfull to deceiue, Wealthie and rich in sundrie goods, and ease in plow lands large, Caues, liuely [running] lakes, and coldish Tempe shades, The bellowing or moouing noise of open, pleasant steeps In shadowes vnderneath a tree, hills, and dens of wild beasts, Are not away or wanting there [among the countrie folks] Youth bearing or abiding worke, and so vs'de to little charge, The sacrifices of the gods, and holie fathers too, And iustice parting from the earth hath made hir last [abode] Or set hir footsteps last of all among those [countrie folks;] But let the Muses sweet aboue all things, with mightie loue Of whome I smitten [wounded] doo their sacrifices beare, [Let them I say] take and possesse me principally [first] And let them shew the wayes of heauen and stars likewise to me, Th' eclipses diuerse of the sun and labours of the moone, Whereof comes quaking in the earth, by what force hie seas swell, Their bounds being broken, and returne within themselues againe, Thy winter suns should make such haste to dip or wash themselues In Ocean sea, or what delay should let slowe [winter] nights. But if cold bloud about the hart shall hinder me, that I May not come neere these parts of na-ture [them to vnderstand] Let countrie soile and watering streams please me in vallies low, Let men loue riuers, yea and woods clown like. O what can set Or place me where be [pleasant] feelds and Sperohius [riuer runs]. And Taiget [hills] hawnted with Bac-chus ghests the Lacen maids! O who can set me in the val-lies coole of Hemus mount, And couer me with shadows great of branches [full of leaues.] Happie is he that could of things the causes vnderstand, And hath cast vnder feet all feare, and destnie not intreatable, And noise of greedie Acheron [that floud or feend of hell.] Happie likewise is he which dooth acknowledge countrie gods, Pan [god of shepheards] and Sylua-nus old [the god of woods] The nymphs neere sisters [goddesses of hills and waters all:] Not office or authoritie of people [giuing it] Nor purple robe of kings hath stird or moou'd the countriman, And disagrement vexing bre-thren faithles and vntrustie, Nor Danish people comming downe from Istrian streams conspirde [Or people dwelling neere the same] nor Romanish affairs And realms about to perish quite [haue not diseased him,] Ne hath he sorrowd pittieng the helples, or repinde And grudged at him that hath enough [but kept him in a meane] He gathered hath the frutes which boughes haue borne of own accord, Which countrie grounds themselues well wil-ling [not constraind haue borne] Ne hath he seene [hard] yron lawes, nor pleadinges at the bar Unsober mad and quarellous, nor courts or offices Where peoples euidences are recorded and inrolld. Some men doo force the blind [and vn-seene] seas [with sails &amp;] ores, And rush int'armor, they doo pearse [or prease] into the courts And palace gates of kings [thereby to purchase some aduancement:] One forceth and assalteth towns with vtter ouerthrowes, And miserable houshold gods that he might drinke in pearle, And sleepe in Sarran purple clothes: another hoords vp goods And grouelling lies vpon his gold hid in a digged hole: This [man] amazed is made to muse at th' oratorie pulpit, Clapping of hands hath rauisht that man gaping [after praise] (For it is doubted by the throngs of people and of fathers.) [Others] all dropping wet with bloud of brethren doo reioise, And change their houses and abodes so sweet for banishment, And seeke a countrie lieng vn-derneath another sun. The husbandman hath turnd two waies the ground with crooked plow, His labour of the yeare by this, releeueth and mainteins By this his natiue soile and lit-tle nephues [kinred poore,] By this his herds of oxen and his well deseruing bullocks [Are kept] ne is there any rest, but that the yeare abounds Either with frutes of trees, or brood of beasts, or handfull gripes Of corne straw, and dooth burthen the plowd furrows with increase [Or crop], and ouercoms the barns [that they can hold no more] [When] winter coms, the Cicyo-nian berrie [oliues thense] Is prest and drest in oliue mills, and swine come lustie home [Fat fed] with akorns, and the woods doo yeeld their wildings [crabs,] And haruest layes downe [storeth vp thincrease of] diuerse frutes, And vintage milde [or pleasant grape] is made full ripe aloft On stonie [hills or rockie bancks] wide open to the sun. In the meane time sweet babes about [their mothers] dugs doo hang, And honest house keepes honestie [chast huswife, houshold chaste] Kine downward stretch their milkful vd-ders, and fat kids doo fight Or wrestle twixt themselues with [bowd] hornes butting against horns. He [namely the good husbandman] keeps often holidayes, And groueling laid vpon the grasse, where fire is in the midst, And [whereas] his companions crowne a great wineboll about, O Lene [Bacchus] sacrifi-cing he doth call on thee, And sets the maisters of the beasts [or cheefest shepherds] games Or pastimes of the arrow swift in elme [to hit the marke,] And they their bodies very hart [with sun with raine and wind] Strip naked [bare, and out of cloths] for countrie wrestling game, [They strip their bodies hard &amp; tongs with wrestling countrie games.] The old Sabine people honoured and lou'd this life long since, This [life did] Ramus [loue, so did] his brother [Romulus] [The countrie] strong Hetruria, marke ye, increased so, And Rome was made [and so became] the fairest thing of things, Which rounded hath as with one wall seuen hills vnto it selfe, And golden Saturne lead this [countrie] life vpon the earth Before the scepter [gouernement] of the Dictæan king, [Yet Iupiter tooke rule of Creet, and put his father downe,] Before bad people banketted with bullocks staine [to eat.] Men had not yet heard trumpets blowne; nor yet swords layd vpon Hard anuils [stithies] make a noise [while smiths did hammer them.] But we haue rid with spaces [large] plaine ground nigh measureles, And now it's time t'vnlose the smo-king necks of sweating horsses. The third booke of Virgils Georgiks written to a right honourable personage of Italie, as before. The argument of Modestinus a lawyer vpon the third booke of Uirgils Georgiks seruing Italie, and dediated to the aforenamed Mecenas. The poet hath declard and shewd all things in verse diuine, And thee O Pales [goddesse of all medes and pasture grounds] And thee [Apollo likewise] of all shepheards [being god] Well worthie to be counted of [and praisd] throughout the world, And carefull keeping [tending] of cattell and pasture land Lustie and [pleasant] full of grasse; and in what places herds [of bigger beasts] should dwell [abide] and lambs should stalled be. O Pales great [of pasture grounds the goddesse] we also Will sing [or praise] thee, and thee too O shepheard high renowmd From Amphryse floud, and you O woods, and Licey lakes or streams, The resdue of my verses which had held [kept occupide] Minds void [of care] are common all and noised now abrode: [For] who knows not Hurystheus [that] hard [and cruell king] Or th' altars of Busiris dis-commended [tyrant fearce?] To whom hath not beene told [the tale of] Hylas [Hercles] boy, And th' iland of Latona, and the wench Hippodame, And Pelops [Tantals sonne] so stowt on horsse-backe] famous for His iuory shoulders [when his owne was eaten quite away.] A trace or way must tried be, wherby I may lift vp My selfe aloft from ground [beelow] and [like] a conqueror Flie oft before mens faces [to be seene and talked of.] I will bring downe from [Helicon or] th' hill of Aonian Formost with me (if life may last) the muses to my countrie. O Mantua first to thee will I bring Idumean palms [Or giue to thee victorious praise] and I will place [or build] A church of marble in the gree-nish feelds neere to the water Where mightie Mincius [riuer] runs or straies with windings slowe, And doth foreclose or fense the banks with yoong and tender reeds: In midst for me shall Cæsar be, and shall possesse the church, I conqueror [hauing my wish] and being seene of him In Tyrian purple robe will driue vnto the riuer streames A hundred chariots hauing foure yokt horsses [them to draw,] And let all Grecia leuing Al-pheus [riuer] and the rooads Of Molorch [in Arcadia land] trie maisteries with me In running and raw banging bats [or bastinardos tipt With raw hide lether and wrought full of plummets [studs] of lead. I [Maro Virgill] being deckt about the head with leaues Of shorne or cropped oliue tree, will bring and offer gifts: It doth delight me now to lead great traines in solemne shews Unto the temples of the gods, and to see bullocks slaine, Or how curtens theatricall or pagents on the stage Doo go asside [from former place] their frontiers being turnd, And how the Brittons [English now] wouen [in tapstrie worke] Beare purple hanging vp. I will make in the entrie doores Of gold and sound [meere] iuory or tooth of th' oliphant The skirmish of the Gangards [those folke by Ganges floud] And th' arms of Suirine conqueror [Augustus Cæsars warrs] And heere [ile make the riuer] Nile with battell broils abounding And greatly flowing: pillers too raisd of the brasse of ships Wherwith their noses strengthned be against all storms on sea And [people neere] Nyphates [floud] chased and put to foile, And Parthian [hoast] trusting in flight and shafts turnd [full at foes,] Moreouer two victorious shewes taken by [Cesars] hand From diuerse enimies [of his] and nations on each shore [Both east and west of Ocean sea] in triumph lead away: Yea [grauen] stones of Paros ile [white marble there] shall stand, Breathing representations, or liuely images; The offspring of Assaracus (of whose stocke Cæsar came] The names of that same nation too from Iupiter descended, A Troian was their father, and of Troy was Cynthuis founder. Unhappie enuie [sore] shall feare the furies [feends below] And Cocyte rigorous riuers too, and Ixions writhren snakes, And the mayne wheels [of Sisiphus] and stone not conquerable. O my Mecenas let vs in the meane time follow woods Of Dryades [goddesses of trees, and parks [of beastes] toucht, Thy biddinges or commandements are not light [in account] Our mind begins no loftie thing without [consent of] thee. Lo, go to, breake off slowe delaies, Cytheron [forrests] calls With mightie noise, so dooth the dogs of Taiget hill also, And [eeke the citie] Epidaure the tamer of [great] horsses, The voice of them redoubled ringes with eccho of the woods: Howbeit I will girded be [or readilie prepard] Streight waies to tell the battels hot of Cæsar, and to beare Or carrie by report his name, throughout so many years As Cæsar is far off from the first birth of Tithon [old] If anie body wondering at the [notable] rewards Of victorie olympiacall [so nam'd of Olympia fields] Dooth horsses feed; or who so [keeps] strong bullocks for the plow, Then let him choose [them] cheefly [by] the bodies of their dams. The fashion of a beetle browd or sterne cow is the best, Whose head is fowly big, whose necke is very great withall, And from whose chin a dewlap or a crop hangs to hir shanks; Againe, in whose long sides there is no measure or proportion, That hath all parts both great and large, yea euen hir very foot, [Whose] eares are hearie rough vnder hir crooked [writhen] hornes: Nor let [a cow] marked with specks and white, me discontent, Or one refusing yoke [to beare] and sometimes shrewd with horne, And neere in vissage to a bull, in growth hie all in all, Which going sweeps hir fellowes trea-dinges with hir tayle below. Th' age t'abide Lucina, and to suffer Hymens due, [By Lucine I meane caluing, and by Hymen bulling time] This age dooth end before ten yeeres, and after foure begins, The rest of [th' age] vnable is for brood and bringing foorth, Not strong for plow: in the meane time [betwixt foure years and ten] Whiles lustie youth remaines in heards of cattell [cows or mares] Let loose your horsses, put your beasts to Venus [breeding] first, and store [your selfe] with gendring still one yoongling with another; [For] euery best and first day of [our] age dooth slip away From miserable mortall men, diseases follow after, And sad old age, and labour too, th' ungentlenes of hard [Or cruell] death dooth take away the life [of man and beasts.] There shalbe [breeding mares and kine] alwaies [vpon thy ground] Whose bodies thou hadst rather to be changed [for the best] And euermore repare them [or renew them that decay.] Preuent or ouertake [that fault] and sort or choose out yeerly Yoong cattell for thy heards [increase] least afterwards thou maist seeke vp againe [such breeders as thou] missed [hast] and lost. The selfe same choise there is likewise in horsses [to be made] Bestow thou from their tender years [or lims] especiall paines [Upon those horsses] which thou meanst [intendest] presently For hope of kinde to put to mare [to couer and ingender.] The fole or colt of gallant beast [which coms of a good kind] Dooth by and by [when he is fold] tread hie [or goe vpright] In fields or medows, and laies downe [to rest] his softly legs, And dares go iornies first of all, and threatning riuers trie, And put himselfe to seas vnknowne; ne feares he noises vaine; His necke vpright, a fine made head, short beilie and fat backe, His brest courragious dooth abound with brawns or lumps of flesh: Bright bay and dapple gray the fai-rest horsses be and best, Woorst colour is in [horsses] white, or branlie [horsse like box.] Moreouer [horsse of gallant kind] knows not ne will stand still In one and selfe same place, if war-like armor make a noise He wags his ears and stirs or shakes his lims [with life and spirit] And keeping downe the fire [or heat] which gathered is within Doth roll or void it at his nose-trils [blowing all amaine] His mane is thicke, and cast vpon his right shoulder [there] lies, A double spine or large backe bone is drawne alongst his loines, The ground he maketh hollow [where he treads he casts vp earth] His hoofe with horne sound all about dooth greatly make a noise: Such one was Cyllarus [that horsse tam'd with the rains and bit Of Pollux Amycleus,, and [such horsses] as of which The Grecian poets made report, horsses of [mightie Mars Yokt [linked, coupled] two by two, and coch of great Achilles. Swift Saturne at the comming of his wife was such a one, And flang his maine on horsses necke [wherin he turnd himselfe] And taking heels filld Pelion hills with wihhies shrill [of his.] Hide thou [from vse of mare such gal-lant horsse as] this same is, When he decaies or falles away, or greeued is with sicknesse, Or lazie now or labourlesse with yeeres ne spare his age Il fauourd [or beare with his age not fowle il fauoured.] The elder horsse is cold for Venus [lustfull fleshly worke,] And lingers labour much mislik'te and lost [in riding mares;] And if at anie time he comes to skirmishes [or running] He rageth and takes on in vaine: euen as a mightie fier Is fearce a while withouten force: and therefore thou shalt marke Especially his courage and his age and thereupon Some other skills or vses, and their parents brood [also] [What kinde of colts the horsse and mare (that bred these) were before] What greefe there is in ech of them foiled and ouercome, What glorie of the victorie [or getting of the game.] Doost thou not see when coches [drawne with horsses] taken haue The feeld at once in headlong race [or running all for life.] And rush amaine let loose from rails [or lists where they stood tide] When hope of youths is raised vp [and bent to win the game] And panting feare [to loose it] draws [or sucks] their ioyfull harts? They prease on forward with their [lash-ing] whip of writhen [cord] And leaning forward giue the raines or bridels [to the horsses:] The axelltree all fierie hot, doth flie with farre amaine Now downe below now vp aloft through void and emptie aire, They seeme for to be carried and t'arise into the skie, Ne is there any lingering nor resting [by the way:] But [then] a cloud or storme of yel-low sand is hoised vp, [The horsse] wax wet with froth and fome, and with the blowing of The [horsses] following [next to them in teeme or course of chase,] Their loue of praises is so great, and victories care so great. Ericthonie durst first of all ioyne coch and horsses foure, And sit full fast on snatching wheeles [like to] a conqueror, The Lapiths of Peletronie [a towne in Thessalie.] Set on [horsses] backe gaue them bridels and running in the ring, And taught the horsseman vnder arms [or hauing harnesse on] To praunse vpon the ground and his proud pases for to round. Each labour equall is [each tricke indifferently is taught,] Namely, to praunse and roundly tread, to amble and to trot: And horsmaisters seeke all alike a horsse yoong, hot, and quicke, Althouge he chased hath in flight his foes put oft [to foile] And make report or vaunt Epire his countrie soile to be, And Mycen strong, and fetch his stocke from Neptunes race it selfe. These [matters] well considered, th' horsmasters earnest be Before the time [of mareroiling] and all their care bestow To stuffe or fill with fatnesse thick [that horse] which they haue chosen, And nam'd to be the husband to the beast [or breeding mare] And they cut growing grasse for him, and giue him riuer water, And corne or graine, least that he should not able be to serue Sufficiently the pleasant la-bour [of ingendring yoong,] And [least] the weakling foles or colts should beare in open shew The leannesse of their parents [horse and mare of whom they came.] [Th' horssmasters also slender make and lanke with leannesse thin, Being willing [so to do] the [breed-ing] cattell [or the mares,] And when the sport alredy knowne doth stir vp couplings first, They do deny them leaues [so greene] and driue them from the springs, And shake or mooue them often times with running [vp and downe] And tire or weary them likewise with [labouring in] the sun: [Then] when the threshing floore doth grone greatly or greeuously With corne bethwackt and threshed out, and when as th' empty chaffe Is cast against the westerne wind, rising with pleasant blast, This do horssmasters least by too much ranknesse, duller vse Might be in breeding fallow feeld, and fill with slimie stuffe Th' unseruiceable furrowes. But that thirsting it may take Venus the seed of breeding yoong, and inwardly lay vp The same [within hir very wombe or due conceiuing place.] Againe, the care of horsses doth begin to fall or faile, And care of mares to come in place: when [therefore] mares do stray Being big with yoong, their mouths run out, let none [then] suffer them To draw the yoke in heauie carts, nor t'ouercome the way With leaping, and to passe through pa-stures with a speedy pase [Or crop the grasse of medow grounds in going swiftly by] And for to swim in catching streames [streams carrieng things away] But let [horssmasters] feed them in void parks or empty feelds, And neere vnto full riuers where mosse is, and also where The banke is very greene with grasse, and caues may couer them, And rockie shades may ouerreach [and keepe them from the sun.] A flieng vermin haunteth much about the woods or groues Of Siler [riuer] and about Alburne [that port or hauen] Greene growne with holms; which [vermins] name in Latine is Asilus, The Greekes haue turnd it [in their toong] by calling of it Oestrus, Sharpe stinging, buzzing hatefully and too vnpleasantly, Of whom the cattell all afraid, run here and there the woods Th' aire being beaten with their mo-wing rageth furiously, So do the woods, so doth the banke of drie Tanagrus [brooke] Iuno hauing deuisd a plage for Inachs heifer, she Did practise on a time hir wrath and anger horrible With this same monster. Thou shalt driue from cattell big with yoong This vermin, and shalt feed thy heards at sunrising betimes, Or when the stars draw on the night [at euening not too late:] For in the midday heats this flie most eagarly doth sting. All care is put quite ouer [from the cowes] vnto the calues, After the time of bringing foorth, and [owners then of beasts] Doo by and by set marks on them, and of their kind the names, And which they rather had to ride the cow for hauing cattell, Or sand for holy altars, or to cut and plow the ground, And vpside downe to turne the feeld all rough with broken clods: The other [yoonger] beasts are fed vpon the grasse so greene, Embolden now thy bullocks, those which thou wilt fashion to Th' exercise and occu-pation of good husbandry, And enter thou the way of ta-ming them, whiles that the na- tures of the yoonglings gentle be, and trainable their age: And first bind thou about their necks slacke collars of small twigs, Then afterwards when as they shall accustome and enure Their necks at liberty and free to seruice and to toile, Ioine equall matches fitted by the very [necke] collars, And then compell the bullocks to keepe pase or go together, And let the void or emptie wheels be drawne oft now of them Alongst the ground, and let them marke their feet on top of dust [Let them learne lightly for to tread.] Then beechen apple tree Forcing it selfe and labouring vnder a mighty waight, Let it creake afterwards, and let the brasen wainbeame [strong] Draw both the wheels together ioind. In the meane time thou shalt Plucke vp or gather for thy yoong-ling cattell yet vntamde, Not only grasse nor willow leaues sparing and very small, And fennie seaweed [called Reeke of some] but also corne Sowne by the hand; ne shall thy bree-ding kine fill vp the pales Snowwhite [with milke] according to the maner of our fathers, [As they were woont in our forefa-thers time full oft to doo.] Thou shalt not milk the dams [the kine accompanied with their calues] But they shall spend their vdders whole vpon their yoonglings sweet. But if there be in thee a mind, or a desire to wars, Troops [of horssmen] fierce, or to outflow and ouerrun With wheeles th' Alphean streams of Pi-sa [that renowned towne.] And oft to driue [swift] flieng co-ches in the game of Ioue, Th' exercise or labour first of horsse is for to see The courages and armor of stout warriors, and t'abide The crooked trumpets, and to beare the groning wheele in draught, And eke to heare in stable brasen bridles making noise: Then after to reioise [and take a pleasure] more and more In flattring prayses of his mai-ster, and to loue the sound Of clapped necke [with palme of hand] and let the colt heare these [Forenamed noises] presently so soone as he is weind At first from teat or dug of dam, and let him giue [or vse] His mouth to halters soft in steed [of snaffle or of bit] Being but weake and fearefull too, and ignorant of his age, [Unskilfull how to liue, wherein old horsses trained be.] But when his fourth age, [or fourth yeare] approched is and come, Three being past, let him begin streightwaies to tread the ring, And make a trampling noise with trea-dings comely [downe by art] And let him bow by course the ben-dings of his legs [his ioints] And let him be like labouring [horsse] then let him chafe the aire With runnings [or prouoke the winds too weake with him to run] And flieng through th' open plaine feelds, as freed of his rains, Let him skarse set his feet vpon th' vpmost of the sand. As northerne wind when being thicke hath laid [on sea and land] From Hyperborean [northerne] coasts, and driueth diuers waies The Scythian winter storms and drie [or rainlesse] clouds also, Then [whiles] the corne is growne [full] hie, and swimming feelds doo quake With gentle smooth and euen winds; &amp; highest tops of woods Do giue a sound or make a noise; and waues or flouds from far Force to the shores: that [wind] doth flie, sweeping both land and sea At once in chase. This [horsse compard to northerne wind so swift] Shall sweat at bounded races and great spaces of the field Of Eleus, and shall cast out froth bloody at his mouth; And he shall better beare and draw [French] Belgic coches with His gentle soft or tender necke: then suffer thou at last, Thy horsses being tamed now, their bodies great to grow With prouender [or horssebread] thicke and grosse [wherein is tacke] For yer their taming they will take vp courage great and stout, And being catcht, they wil refuse t'abide the winding whips, Or to obay [or take in mouth] hard bits [like teeth of woolues:] But any diligence or skill set-tels not their strength more Than for to turne or put away Venus [the worke of flesh] And pricks or stings of [Cupid] loueblind [hidden and vnseen] Whether the profit or the vse of oxen or of horsse More pleasurable is or seruiceable to a man. And therefore [cattell masters, gra-siers] they do put apart The buls far off in pasture grounds alone behind a hill Iust opposit or full against [from sight of any cow,] And eke beyond brode riuers; or they keepe [their buls] shut vp [In stals] at racke and manger full: for why the female [cow] By little and by little gets away the strength [of bull] And burns or sets him all on fire with seing hir, ne doth She suffer him to thinke of woods, nor yet of grasse; but she Doth eg and tempt with sweetish baits oft times the [buls so] proud Louing [the kine] betweene themselues mastries to trie with horns. The faire yoong cow [or heifer] is fed in the wood so great, They keeping course [smiting avy] with violence very much Mingle their skirmishes with many wounds and often hurts, Blacke blood doth wash their bodies, and their horns being turnd ful butt With rorings huge are thrust into the [fierce] not withstanding [buls] The woods and great Olympus hill ring eccho with the noise. Ne is't the maner vp to stall together fighting [buls] But th' one quite ouercome departs, and banisht [leads his life] In coasts vnknowne far off bewailing much his great disgrace, And blowes or wounds of conqueror [or bull that ouercame.] Then looking at the loues which he vnreuenged hath lost, And at the stals [whereout] he went, the realms of his forefathers, Therefore he practiseth his force with all care and regard, And lodging all night long he lies among hard stones [twixt rocks] Upon a couch vnmade [vnspread] being fed with rough greene leaues, And sheere grasse sharpe or sedge, and tries himselfe and learns likewise Angrie to be with his owne horns, striking at stocke of tree, And chafes or challenges the winds with strokes, and proffers play At fighting in the sand dispearst and scattered [with his heeles.] Then after strength recouered and force receiu'd afresh, He maketh signs or raiseth vp his standard [captaine like] And headlong carried is against his [old] forgetfull fo: Euen as a waue when it begins to wax or become white In midst of sea drawes hollownesse alongst out of the deepe, And after being rold to land, it rores amaine through rocks, Ne fals it lesser than a hill; but water nethermost Doth boile with whirlepools [rage with gulfes or swallowes turning round, And from below flings vp aloft blacke sand [mingled with earth.] Truly all kind of people and wild beasts, seafish, tamde beasts, And painted [fairly coloured] birds rush in this rage and fire, One selfe same loue in all. The she lion straid not in fields At any other time [than when in loue] the crueller Hauing forgotten hir [yoong] whelps, nor yet the shapelesse beares Hauing giuen at none other time in places euery where So many carcases [to ground] and slaughter through the woods: Then cruell is the bore so wild, then is the tyger woorst, And badly out alas, doth a-ny trauell then alone In feelds of Lybia land [full ill alacke men trauell then In desert feelds of wildernesse of Affrike hot and dry.] Doost thou not see that trembling doth possesse and ouersway The bodies whole of horsses, if but only smell [of mares] Hath brought them airs well known [to them in rank mareroiling time] [And seest thou not] that neither bit and bridle [vsd] of men Nor cruell yerkings, no nor rocks, nor hollow hils or banks, Nor riuers cast betweene [or laid against] do stop or stay [Horsses from mares.] Nor riuers rol-ling hils, or mounteins [tall] Caught vp, [and carried away] with water [of the streame.] The Sabine hog himselfe doth rush and set his teeth on edge, And deeply forward with his foot digs vp the ground and rubs His ribs against or at a tree, and hardeneth his shoulders Against his wounds on this side and on that side [being hurt.] What did a yoong man, in whose bones hard loue [in enterprise] Dooth stir and turne a great fyre vp: truly he swimmeth late In blind night time through streights [of seas] troubled with broken stormes On whom the gate so huge of heauen doth thunder, and the seas, Driuen and dasht vpon the rocks, against him cry amaine, Nor mournfull parents could call home, nor virgin like to dye A cruell death [if parents did withstand hir in hir will] Why [should I tell] what skirmishes the spotted Lynces of [God] Bacchus giue, and cruell kind of woolues and eke of dogs? What skirmishes also th' unwarlike stags or harts [do make.] Marke this, that raging loue of mares is notablest of all, And Venus gaue them such a mind [nature or qualitie] At that time when the coches which foure yoked horsses [nam'd] Potniades [of Potnia that citie] had consum'd And with their chaps deuourd the lims of Glauc [their bringer vp.] Loue leads them ouer Gargar hils, and Ascan roring floud, They passe quite ouer mounteins and swim ouer streams, Immediatly when fire is vn-derput and giuen vnto Their greedie marrow [inward Iust:] in spring time more, bicause In spring time heat coms to the bones: they stand all on hie rocks [Or banks] hauing their faces turnd toward the westerne wind, And inwardly receiue and take light aire [or gentle blasts] And [war] bigbellide with the wind, without all wedlocke helpe, [Without the breeding seed of a-ny horsse] strange to be told. They gallop ouer rocks and hils, and vallies pressed low, Not O thou easterne wind to thine arising, nor the suns, But to the north and northwest wind, or [thither] whense the south Most blacke doth rise, and maketh sad the heauen with rainie cold. At length the lingring poison [or the clammie matter] which The shepheards call by a true name Hyppomanes Horsrage, Drops down from hense [this madding loue] euen from the secret parts Horsrage, horsse madnesse, which oft times bad stepdames gathered haue And taken vp, and mingled hearbs and hurtfull charms therewith. But time in the meane season flits, flits irrecouerable, Whiles we being taken [all] in loue, are carried round about Particular things: this is enough for beasts of bigger growth. Another peece of care remains to beat our wits about, Wooll bearing flocks [sheepe bearing fleese] and rough haire gotes also. From hense coms worke, from hense O strong and sturdy husbandmen Hope [after] praise: ne doubt I [or, ne doubtfull am of mind] How great a thing it is t'aduance or hoist aloft with words These matters, and to giue vnto small things this honour [due,] But sweet or pleasant loue doth catch, and carry me away Through deserts hie of Parnasse hill, it doth delight me much To passe the mounteine tops [that way] where as no beaten path Of former fellowes [poets old] is toward turnd [or leads] Unto Castalia [springs] with soft or easie rising banke. O venerable Pales [thou goddesse of prouender] Now must I sound with mightie voice [smal things in verses great,] Beginning here I charge your sheepe to crop or feed on hay In easie sheepcotes [temperat] paued, or flat and plaine, Till summer season full of leaues be brought againe anon, And t'vnderstrew or spread the bare ground with much straw, and with Handfuls of ferne, least coldish ice [or frost and cold] should hurt The tender cattell, and should bring the scab and filthie gowte. Then after passing hense I charge to serue sufficiently Your gotes with tree sprigs bearing leaues, and water fresh to giue, And for to set your sheepcotes full against the winter sun From winds; [the winter sun before, and northerne winds behind] And turnd vnto the middle day [or to that very place Where doe at noonetide see the sun, which is indeed full south.] Then when cold Aquarie doth fall [in Ianuary month, Or thereabouts, as at the midst of March] and brings in dew At latter ending of the yeare [when springtime doth begin] These cattell [namely gotes] also preserued are to be And safely kept of vs with no care ligh-ter [than are sheepe.] Ne is their vse and profit lesse, although Milesian fleeses, [Or sheepe of Milet countrie] staind or dide in Tyrian reds Are changed for a great [hie price or for some other wares.] Thicker the yoonglings [breed] from hense, from hense [I meane from gotes] Abundance of large milke [of both much more then coms of sheepe] And how much more the milking pale shall fome from dug drawne drie, So much the more their dugs shall yeeld, their niples being prest: Neuerthelesse in the meane time heardsmen shall sheere or poll The beards of gotes Cinyphian [by Cinyps towne or floud Bred and brought vp] their hory chins, and briffely growing haires For vse of teats and couerings for wofull mariners, Gotes truly feed in woods, vpon Lycean [mounteine] tops, On bushes rough, and thorns that loue [to grow in] places hie, And mindfull they come to their homes, and bring their yoonglings [too] And skarsly step the threshold ouer with big dugs [full of milke.] Therefore thou shalt remoue [and turne or put away from them] With all thy care and diligence the frost and snowish winds; The lesse regard that mens necessitie hath vnto them: And gladly thou shalt beare them meat, and twigs of trees for food, Ne shalt shut vp thy haybarns all the midst of winter time: But when as pleasant summer [coms] thou shalt send both the flocks [Of gotes and sheepe] into the woods, and into pasture grounds, The westerne winds calling [or bid-ding thee and them do so.] Let vs crop the cold country grounds at Lucifers first star, [By morning star, and euening star, before and after sun,] Whiles morning time is fresh and gay, and grasse is hory gray, And dew most pleasant vnto beasts is on the tender hearbs. Then when the fourth houre [after sun is risen] gather shall The drought of heauen [thirst of aire] and chirping grashoppers Shall riue or rent the groues of trees with singing: then bid thou Thy flocks go drinke at wels, or else at standing waters deepe, Or waters running out of pipes [spouts made of wood] of holme; [And bid thy flocks] seeke out the dale or vallie full of shade In midst of sommer, if somwhere the oke tree huge of Ioue, Doo reach and spred from ancient trunke or stocke his mighty boughs, Or if somwhere the wood so blacke [and darke] with holy shade Lies neere vnto the holmtrees thicke: and giue them then againe Thin water, and feed them againe at setting of the sun, When coldish [Uesper] euening star asswageth [heat of] aire, And dewish moone doth new refresh the woods and shores of seas Do sound againe the Halcyon, bird [or singing kings fisher] And so do bushes [sound againe] the singing thistle finch. What should I further wade in verse for thee [to vnderstand] The shepheards; what the pasture grounds of [Affrike] Lybia land And cottages dwelt in [of them] with thin and slender roofes. The cattell [there] is fed oft times by day and eke by night, And all the month in order and goes into deserts large Without all inning [housing, fense, shroud, houell, or such like,] So much there of the feeld lies [void of corne and serues for grasse.] T' Affrike heardsman driueth all [the goods he hath] with him, Both house and houshold trinkets, tools, and Amyclean cur, Nam'd Candie quiuer, not vnlike a Roman [soldiour] stout In arms for countries cause [in warlike furniture] when he Taketh his way vnder a lode vneasie [heauie arms] And stands against his enemie yer looking for: the campe Being pitcht and placed in the host [amongst the armed men.] But not [so as in Affrica where beasts be harbourlesse, In that part of the world] wherein the Scythian people be, And water of Meotis fen, and troubled Ister floud Rolling his yellowish sands; and where the mounteine Rhodope Goes backe being stretcht out along vnder the mid northpole. There [heardsmen] keepe their heards shut vp in stables or in stals, Neither doo any hearbs appeare in field, or leaues on tree, But fashionlesse, ilfauoured, vnhandsome lies the land With heaps of snow and with deepe frosts [in places all] abrode, And riseth seuen faddoms hie: there winter alwaies [lasts] And westerne winds are blowing e-uermore cold [wether] there; Yea there the sun doth neuer driue away the shadowes pale, Nor when being borne or carried vpon his horsses [backs] He mounts vp to the loftie skie [ariseth in the east,] Nor when he washeth or dooth wet his hedlong running coch In the red sea of th' Ocean swift [goes downward in the west:] The sudden crafts or flakes of [yce] do grow together hard In running streame; and now the water runneth on his backe Wheeles wrought about with yron worke. That [water] at the first Was harborous to brode wide ships, now harborous to wains: And brasen [tooles] doo commonly in sunder start and rent, And garments put [vpon the barke] become stiffe [with the frost] And they [the people] hew with hat-chets watrish wines, and whole Diches haue turnd [themselues] into sound and substantiall yce, And ragged ysicle hath become hard on their beards vncombd. In the meane time it snowes all o-uer th' aire or skie no les, Cattell doo perish and the bo-dies huge of oxen stand Compast about with frosts, and stags in herds thicke and threefold Are stiffe with heapes [of snow] new [falln, or heapes both rare &amp; strange] And skarse stand out therof with th' high-est tops of all their horns. The Scythians doo not chase or hunt these fearfull stags or harts With putting dogs or hounds to them, nor yet with any nets, Or with the feare of arrow red: but hard at hand them kill With weapon sharpe, thrusting before them with their brest in vaine The mounteine full against them set [the mounteine huge of snow] And staie them braieng greeuously; and so glad [merrie] men They carrie them away with a great shout or mightie crie. [The Scythians] take their careles rest vnder the ground so deepe In digged caues or dens, and haue rolld to their chimnie harths Okes [or the trunks of trees] toge-ther laid [logs in a pile,] And they haue giuen to the fier [or set on fire] whole elms; Heere doo they passe or driue away the night in sport and plaie, And merrie men they counterfet their vinetree quaffing cups, [They make them wines by art in steed of that which grapes doo yeeld] With leuen and sowre seruice be-ries [crusht and pressed out] A kind of men vnbridled, [wilde] subiect [or which abide] Under Septentrio [or Charles waine, seuen stars trianglifide] [Cold] Hyperborean [northerne blastes] and such [a people] is Beaten with th' east Riphean winds [winds from Riphean hills:] Their bodies couered be with haire like brussels hard of beasts, [Of sheeps rough wooll] russet or li-on tawnie [coloured.] If yarne for cloth be vnto thee a care, first thornie thickets And burrs and brambles must away; shun pasture grounds too ranke, [Or flie thou and auoid such food as maketh beastes too fat] And choose or cull out presently [as quickly as thou canst] The whitish flocks with softish wooll: but driue away the ram (Though he be white) whose doong alone is blacke vnder the moist Roufe of his mouth, least with his blac-kish spots he should make dim Duskish and darke the fleeses of the growing [lambs,] and eke Looke round about in feeld full [fraught with flocks] another ram. O Luna, Pan of Arcadie the God deceiued thee (If so be that it be a thing well worthie to beleeue) With [such] a gift of snow white wooll [a ram with fleese snow white] Calling thee into loftie woods; ne didst thou skorne him calling. But he to whome the loue of [ha-uing] nilke [is a regard] Let him beare in his hand vnto the sheepcotes Cythise [shrub] And Lotos [leaues] full oft, and sal-ted herbs or weeds [likewise] Hereby they loue water the more, and stretch their dugs the more, [By this means doo they drinke the more, and doo yeeld milke the more] And giue a secret smacke or taste of saltnes in their milke. Many keepe off or driue away the full growne kids from dams, [Doo waine them] and make fast the foreparts of their lips with strings Wrought full of yron nailes [to pricke the teat and so be waind.] Many doo presse at night that which they milke at rising sun And hours by day [before noonetide] and carrie out in baskets Yer day that which [they milkt] by the darke night and setting sun, The shepheard goes to villages and townes [to sell the same:] Or else they touch and season it with sparing [thriftie] salt, And lay it vp in store for win-ter [when as milke is skant,] Ne may the care of dogs be last [or least regard] to thee, But feede together like fat whelps of Sparta [countrie] and The fearce Molosson [countrie] cur, with whey [to make them] fat: And thou shalt neuer feare, they being keepers [of thy beasts] The night theefe in thy folds or stalls, and runnings in of wolues, Or discontented [Spaniards] Iberians at thy backe. Thou also oftentimes shalt driue in chase fearfull wilde asses, The hare with hounds, and thou shalt hunt the fallow deere with dogs, And chasing wild bores driuen from their wallowing puddels [fowle,] Thou shalt them rowse with barking [of thy hounds] and shalt compell And force with yolping noise [of them] vnto thy trapping nets Ouer the mounteins hie a huge and mightie stag or bucke. Learne thou to kindle in thy stalls [places to keepe thy beasts] Sweet smelling Cedar wood, and driue away the noisome serpents Chelydri with the smokie smell of Galbanum [that gum:] Either the viper dangerous and euill to be taught Lurkes oft in stables [full of doong] vnstird [and seldome clensd] And being fraid auoids the heauen [or shuns the light so cleere:] Or else the adder woonted and accustomed to go Into the couert [of the shade] a cruell place of oxen, [And woont also] to sprincke hir strong poison vpon cattell, Dooth sit abrood vpon the ground [dooth couch vnto the earth.] Thou shepheard [or thou husbandman by fortune finding such] Take stones in hand, catch cudgils [clubs] and throw or strike [the same] Lifting aloft his angry threates and hissing necke all swolne, Euen now when he by skipping thense hath hid his fearfell head Deepe [in some hole] and when his mid-dle winding and the rownds Of his tailes and are loosd, and the last ring or circle drawes Slow windinges [when his head is hid, and middle parts are loose From hindmost parts and stretching out his body, seeming dead.] That snake also [Chelydrus] hurtfull in Calabrian woods Folding his skalie backe toge-ther with brest lifted vp, And spotted all the bellie long with specks great and large, Which [worne] whiles any streams are bro-ken out of running springs, And whiles grounds moistoned be in spring-time wet and waterish With raine southerne winds, dooth hunt the standing waters, and Dwelling or keeping on banckesides, this serpent [mischeefous] Dooth fill his fowle blacke gorge with fish, &amp; speaking [croking] frogs, After the fen is drawne out drie, and ground with heat doo gape, He leapes out on drie land, and wrething round his flaming eyes Tyranniseth, or practiseth great crueltie in feelds, Eger with drowght and fraid with heat. It may not please me then To take sweet sleeps in open aire, nor on my backe to ly Upon the grasse in woods; when he is new become againe Hauing cast off his skin, and trick-sie trim with youth afresh Is rolled hie or turnd against the sun, and wags himselfe Or glistereth with a three edged toong in his [malicious] mouth, Leauing at home in house his yoong-ling [serpents] or his egs. I will thee teach the causes and the tokens of diseases. The filthie scab dooth cumber sheepe, when cold and mistie raine Hath setled and sunke deepe into the quicke, [life parts and bones] And quaking winter with gray frosts, or sweat vnwasht away Dooth cleaue vnto them being shorne; and when sharp pricking thorns Haue rent or torne their bodies. Now therfore doo sheepmasters Wash well and throughly all their beasts in [running] riuers sweet; The ram also with fattie fleese, or moist and greasie wooll Is diued often in the gulfe, and being let alone [Or put into the streame] he down-ward swims with merie tide, Or else [men] doo annoint and rub their bodies polld and shorne With smarting dregs of oile, and they doo mingle therwithall The spume of argent, sulphur quicke, [or brimstone naturall] And pitch of trees on Ida hill, and fattish wax with grease, And Scilla [onion of the sea] and heauie Hellebore, And blacke Bitumen [lime of Iu-da lake or Syrian earth,] But yet there is not any lucke of labours present more, [No medcine of more redie helpe] than if so be a man Could cut and lance or open with a knife the very mouth Or vpmost part of rotten sore: the sicknes and disease Or the corruption nourisht is, and liues by hiding it, Whiles that the shepherd dooth deny to put to helping hands Unto the wounds, or sitteth still beseeching gods [aboue] All things the better [to befall]. Moreouer when as paine being falln into the very bones [or marow closd within] Of bleating sheepe outragious is, and when a feuer drie [On lingering consumption] dooth cut away the lims, It hath bene profitable to auert or turne away The kindled heats, and for to strike a veine stuft full of bloud Betweene the lowest hoofes [or sole and bottome] of the foot, In maner as Bisalts [people in Macedonie] And Gelons [people] fearce [in warrs] accustomd are [to doo] When he doth flie to Rhodope [a hill in Thracia land] And wildernesses of the Ghets [a people bordering there] And drinketh milke thickned with bloud of horsses [or of mares.] Auoid or take away with knife [or burning yron] the fault [Or sicknes of that sheepe] which thou shalt see oft far behind, Or [oftentimes] to goe into the gentle [pleasant] shade, Or slowly cropping th' upmost [parts or tops of] grasse or weeds, And hindermost or very last to follow [all the droue,] And to giue place alone vnto the lateward [comming] night, [Auoid I say the fault] before infection horrible May creepe quite through or ouer all th' unwarie multitude [Or flocke of sheepe not hauing wit to shun so shrewd a plage] Ne doth a whirle winde forcing win-ter [storms or shours of haile] In sea [or plaine fields] rush or fall so oft as many plages Of beastes; ne doo diseases take their bodies seuerall, But all [the cattell] suddenly summering [in shadie places,] Yea th' hope [of flocke] and flocke at once [the yoong and old for brood] And all the kind or sort of them euen from the very first. If any man [had] then [behold] the mounteins [aierie Alps Diuiding Italie from France and Germanie likewise.] And Norike castels [built] on lit-tle hislocks, or the fields Of Timaue [floud] in Iapis [of Venice being part] And now also so long after should see the realms [or grounds] Of shepheards made a wildernes, or vtterly forsaken, And vp landes far and wide lie void: let that man vnderstand [What I haue said before of beasts, all sicke at once, not some.] A miserable tempest [or plage] sometimes arose Heere [in this land] by sicknes or infection of the aire, And burned [during] all the heat of haruest [burned sore With feruent fits of feuers hot like heat of haruest time] And gaue to death all kind of beasts and cattell tame and wild, Corrupted ponds or lakes and poi-sond pastures with the rot: Ne was the way of death all one [alike or naturall] But when the fierie thirstines being forste to all the veins had drawne away [or made to shrinke] their miserable lims, A thin superfluous water did abound againe, and did Draw all their bones togither falln by little and by little With their disease: a sacrifice standing at th' altar oft In th' honor of the gods among or in the midst of people, Whiles that the woollen miter with a snow white fillet [or a ribben] compassed or hembd about, hath fallen downe Faintfull and like to die among the leasurable preestes: Or if the sacrificer had slaine with a knife some [beast] Before [it fell downe fainting] nor that th' altars burnd therwith The bowels being laid theron: ne can the prophet giue Or make his answeres being askt his counsell and aduise; And kniues thrust in are skarsly staind and coloured with the bloud, And vpmost stand is duskish made with matter leane and thin. Hereby calues and yoong bullocks die in ranke grasse euery where And yeeld their sweet liues vnto stalls full [of conuenient food] Hereof coms madnes vnto fawn-ing dogs, the breathing cough Dooth shake sicke swine and strangles them with fowle fat chops [big blowne] The conquerous horsse vnluckie and vnmindfull of his gaines And of his grasse falls [faintingly] and water springes refuseth, And strikes the ground oft with his foot, his eares are hanged downe, Sweat doubtfull [vpon cause vnknowne] is there, and the same [sweat] In horsses truly like to die is cold, their skin is drie, And being hard withall resistes the handler in the touching: These signes they giue in the first dayes before their end and death. But if the sicknes hath begun to be more raw and sore, In processe or continuance, then firie be their eies, Their breathing combersome is fetcht, sometimes with groning deepe, And straine their inward bowels with much yexing [or long sobbing] Blacke bloud out of their nosetrils goes, their rugged toong also Doth put to paine their chaps shut close [not able to be open.] It hath beene good and profitable to poure in at their mouth With horne put thereinto the wine of [Bacchus] Lenæus; That [helpe to] health one and alone was seene in dieng horsse: And by and by againe the selfe same wine was to their death, And being much amended with their madnesse [which doth seeme T'affoord them strength and lustinesse, but lasts a little while] They burned [more in frantike fits] and rent with their bare teeth Their tatterd lims all torne, a while before their greeuous death. The gods graunt good men better [lucke] and giue our foes that rage; And lo the ox vnder hard plow smoking [with sweat] fals downe, And vomits at the mouth his blood mingled with froth or fome, And casteth vp his latter grones or gasps [and then he dies:] The plowman he goes sad away, vnyoking th' other ox Greeuing or sorrowing at his bro-thers death, and leaues the plow Sticke fast in the midst of his worke; not shadows of the woods, Not pleasant grasse can moue his mind, not riuer cleerer than Amber, which being rold by rocks [or streaming thorow stones] Romes to the feeld: but yet his sides below at nether parts Are loosed [or be faint] and dul-nesse or else giddinesse Oppresseth his ill sighted eies, his necke and head also Doth waue vnto the ground with stoo-ping weight [down right yborn] What good doth labour [taking paine] what doth well doing helpe? What helps it to haue turned vp the ground with plough? But how [coms it to passe?] for why, the Massike gifts of Bacchus, [Wines comming of the grapes which grow on Massike mountein hie] Haue not annoid ne hurt [those beasts] nor meat stord vp [oft eaten,] For they are fed with leaues of trees, and food of simple hearbs, Their drinks are running waters cleere, and riuers exercisd With flowing, ne doth carefulnesse breake off their wholesome sleeps. Folke say that oxen are desird or sought in those same coasts For Iunos sacrifices at none other time [than when They perish all: and folke do say] that coches driuen be Unto the [gods] hie treasuries with buffs vnequall matcht. Therefore do plowmen painfully breake vp or cleaue the ground With mattocks, rakes or harrowes; and dig deepe or burie with Their very nailes [or fingers ends] the corne [that serues for food] And drag quite ouer mountains hie their creeking carts or wains With stretched necke. The woolfe doth not watch [to lay] snares about The sheepfolds, neither walks by night before the flocks of sheepe: A care more eager tameth him. The fearfull fallow deere And coursing bucks do wander then, and go among the hounds, And all about mens houses the waues wash the brood of sea Unmeasurable big, and all the kind of swimming fishes On furthest [part of all the] shore like shipwracke carcases. Unwoonted seacalues flit vnto the riuers or the flouds, The viper also vainly fenst in crooked lurking holes Dooth perish: so doo watersnakes or adders all amazd With skales vpstanding. Th' aire is not vpright and iust to birds, So that they headlong leaue their life vnder a loftie cloud. Moreouer, neither dooth it skill, their meat now to be changed, Meanes medcinable now doo hurt, maisters [phisicians] Haue ceast [or giuen ouer th' art of phisicke, or be dead] Chyron Phillyrides, and A-mythaon Melampus, [Two famous old phisicians haue ceast to be, are dead.] [The hellish hag] Tisiphone pale [faced] plaies the tyrant And being sent from Stygian darck-nes [or the diuels lake] Into the light abrode doth driue sicknes and feare before hir, And rising vp she daily lifts aloft hir greedie head, Riuers and bankes being drie: and hills which vpward lie [to heauen] [Or mounteins hie] doo make a noise with bleating of the sheepe, And often bellowinges or the mow-inges [both of ox and cow] And now she makes a slaughter great by companies or troupes, And heapeth vp within the stalls the carrions falln downe dead With fowle consuming filthie rot, vntill men learne [the meanes] To couer or to burie them within the ground, and eke To hide them ouer head and eares in ditches or in pits. For in their hides there was no vse [or profit to be found] Nor any body able is to clense their bowels [flesh] With water, [boile it in a pot and porridge make therewith,] Or t'ouercome it with the fire, [make rostmeat of the same:] Nor yet to sheere their fleeses ea-ten through with their disease And running matter, neither can atteine vnto or get A rotten web of cloth [of such vnseruiceable wooll.] Moreouer if that any had made proofe or tride therewith To make him hated garments, wheales and burning blisters too, And nastie sweat did follow [and consume] his stinking lims, Yea and Saint Ant'nies curssed fire [a plagie running sore] Did eat in no long lingering time the ioynts togither shrunke. The 4. booke of Virgils Georgiks, dedicated to Mecenas a right honorable gentleman, &amp;c. The argument of Modestinus a lawyer or counseller in the law, vpon the fourth and last booke of Virgils Georgiks or husbandrie, principally seruing Italie, &amp;c. The poet shows [in this fourth booke] eftsoons [or full at large] The kingdoms [hiues] of hony, ai-rie [gathered in the aire] And bees of Hybla [citie in Sicilia, and he shews] The waxen houses of [their] hiues [their honicombs] and what Flours elsewhere [grow] and also what bee swarms are to be got Or gathered together, and moist dropping honicombs, [Gods] heauenly gifts [made of the dew of heauen, &amp; iuice of flours. O [my] Mecenas now will I dispatch forthwith [to shew] The heauenly gifts or benefits of airie honie [sweet] Looke on this peece [of worke] likewise [as thou hast on the rest] I will declare to thee the sights or shews most wonderfull Of things but light [namely of bees] and their couragious guides, The maners, vsage and the drifts of all that [thriftie] kind, Their people and their skirmishes in order [duly all:] My labour is a little thing [a toy] but yet my praise Or glory is not little, if the gods vngratious [shrewd, Veiauis, Auerruncus, and Robigus with the rest] Do suffer any [such assay] and if Apollo be- ing cald vpon do heare me [and set forward this my worke.] In primis for the bees a seat or standing must be got, Whereto no passage for the winds may be (for why the winds Do hinder them to carrie home their meat vnto their house) Nor where the sheepe and skittish gotes [the lambs &amp; wanton kids] May often leape vpon the flours, or straieng cow in field May strike away the dew, and weare or wast the rising hearbs, Let painted lizzards [speckled newts] hauing foule filthie backs Be far from their fat stals [full hiues] and eke the Meropes And other birds, as Progne [the swallow] markt on the brest With bloodie hands: for they do wast and spoile all things abrode, And carrie in their mouth the fli-eng [bees] a pleasant meat To their vngentle [rauening] nests [their yoong to feed therewith.] But springs so cleere and standing waters growing greene with mosse, A little riuer also run-ing by or through the grasse, Must be neere to [their hiues] the palme or date tree, and the huge Wilde oliue tree must ouer shade th' entrance [of their hiues,] That when the new king bees shall lead out in their due spring time The first swarms, and the yoong ones being sent abrode [let out] Shall plaie and dallie with their ho-nie combs, the bancke neere by Might then entise to go away from th' heat [into the shade,] And that the tree full in their way might keepe and interteine Them in their branching harborows [or bowghs full of greene leaues:] Or if the water shall stand still, or if the same shall flow, Cast willowes ouerthwart [a crosse] and big stones [therewithall,] Into the midst [of all the wet] that there the bees may rest As vpon bridges [placed] thicke together [or oft times] And may spread all abrode their winges against the summer sun, If that perhaps the violent ea-sterne wind shall scatter them Lingering [abrode,] and them shall drowne in Neptune [waters wet] Let Casia greene [those pleasant flours] and th' herbe calld Sauorie Smelling most strong farre off [abrode] and store of Thymbra strong Of sent; let them and this grow vp and flourish th' hiues about, And let the banckes of violets drinke the moistening water springes; But let thy very hiues themselues, whether the same be sowde And made of hollow barkes, or wo-uen with bent ozier rods, Let them haue narrow entrances: for winter with the cold, Dooth thicken and make honie hard, as heat [in summer time] Dooth soften and dissolue the same all molten and made thin. Each violence and force is to be feard alike of bees, Ne doo the bees in vaine besmeare and ouerdawb with wax Most painfully who shall doo best, the little breathing holes Within their hiues; and fill or stop the gaps the clifts or rifts: With Fucus [that same reddish herb] and with [the leaues of] flours, And they doo saue the glue [or gum] gathered [of flours and herbs] To these same seruices and vse [which glue] more clammie is Than birdlime, and the pitch of I-da [hill in] Phrigia [sand] Bees also haue beene often to dig them houses in Or vnderneath the ground (if the report hereof be true) In holes digd open; and [they haue beene found] in pumish stones All inward hollow, and within the truncke of eaten tree Howbeit dawbe thou and annoint their lodgings full of clifts [Their hiues] with [ox doong or with] mud [laid] smoothly [thereupon] keeping them warme all round about, and cast vpon the same Thin leaues [leaues thinly strewd, to keepe the mud or cow doong moist] Ne suffer thou the yewghtree grow to neere vnto their houses, Ne burne thou on a hearth red sea-crabs or red creuises, Ne trust thou fennice waters deepe [nor let thy bees be] where The smell of durt is noisome [strong,] or where the hollow rocks With beating force [of waters] may resound and make a noise, And where the likenes of the voice offended dooth rebound. That which remaineth [is] that when the golden sun hath chaste The winter being driuen away quite vnderneath the earth, And hath vnshut or opened heauen with summers [pleasant] light They passe through vplandes presently, and through woods they flie, And they doo gather, reape or sucke the purple coloured flours, And light [of body] they doo slip or taste the vpmost streames, And being lustie hereupon, with what delight I know not, They nourish and mainteine their brood, their nests or hiues also, And hereupon they fashion out fresh or new wax by skill, And make fast honie. Furthermore, when thou shalt see on hie, A swarme let foorth or got abroad out of their [hiues or] rages, Up to the stars of heauen [in th' aire] to swim [with ores of winges] All summer cleere, and woonder shalt a darke clowd drawne to be With windes, marke thou that alwaies then [bees] seeke sweet waters, &amp; Harbroughs of greenish leaues [abodes among the boughs of trees.] Hereto [to this end] sprinckle thou iuces [which] bidden [be] Bruzde Melilot and common grasse of Cerinth [or the leaues But little woorth of honniesuck-els growing in the hedge] And make a ringing [noise of ba-sons] and shake all about The rattels of [Cybele] mo-ther of the gods aboue. The bees will settle all at once vpon their sprinckled seats; And of their owne accord will hide [or get] themselues within Their inmost clossets [inward rooms] according to their vse. But if they shall go foorth to fight (for discord creepeth oft Betweene two kinges with great ado) [much stirre,] thou maist fore-know Immediatly the peoples minds and trembling hartes in warre, Long time [before they pitch the feeld.] For that same warlike noise Of brasen trumpet hoarse in sound doth checke the [bees.] behinde Abiding [in their hiues] and then a voice resembling [like] The broken sounds of trumpets is heard [all among the bees.] Then fearefull they together go, and meet among themselues They glister, with their winges and shar-pen with their snowes their stings, And fit their arms [to fight] and mingled are about their king Thicke [thronging] and they go vnto their courts or seats of iudgment, And call [or challenge] out their fo with great and mightie cries. Therefore when they haue got a faire and cleere spring time, and [haue] Obteined and got feelds large and wide, they rush out of the gates And are in skirmish: then a sound is made in th' aire aloft; And being mixt they gathered be into a great round heape, And fall downe headlong; haile [fals] not so thicke out of the skie, Nor so great store of akorns rain-eth downe from shaken oke. [The king bees] through the midst of th' ar-mies [flie] with gallant wings, [With wings like ensigns or like stan-dards in the campe displaid] And they turne oft or exercise within their narrow brests Great courages; with standing hard, [or minding not at all] To yeeld, vntill the heauie con-queror compelled hath These or else those to giue their backs turnd [to their foes] by flight, These stirrings vp of courages, these skirmishes so great, Shall cease prest downe with throwing on them but a little dust, [For they will thinke that haile or raine doth fall out of a cloud.] But after thou hast called home from battell both the guides [The kings or capteins] put to death him which shall seeme the woorser, Least he a spend all might do hurt: and suffer thou the better [To liue] that he may rule in court or palace void [of fo.] Th' one [of the kings, the best of two] shalbe bright burning red, With shining speckles like to gold (for kinds of kings are twaine) The better [king] is notable in face [or markt for making] And passing gay with shining skales [well known by glistering specks,] Th' other [king] illfauoured is, and rough with idlenesse, And vnpraiseworthy drags his large brode belly all along. As there are of the kings [of bees] two makings, fashions, forms, So of the people [common bees] there are two bodies [shapes.] For why some [bees] are [owglie] foule, illfauoured and rough: As when a thirstie traueller coms out of the deepe dust, And spitteth with his mouth so drie vpon the [dustie] ground Some other bees do shine and gli-ster with a brightnesse cleere, Shining like gold [and haue] their bo-dies dasht with euen drops, [Marked with spots of equall size] this is the better brood: From hense in due time of the yeare, or at a certeine season, They shall presse out sweet honie, nor so much pleasant and sweet As clarifide or cleere from dregs, and like [t'amend or] tame Th' hard tast of Bacchus [or of wine, of sharpe wine making sweet.] But when the swarms do flie astray, and in the aire do play, And care not for their honicombs, and leaue their houses cold; Thou shalt withdraw or stay their wa-uering minds from vain pastime. To stay their play is no great toile. Take from the kings their wings, And none of them will beare them bold to go a iornie hie, [To flie aloft in th' aire] or pull the standard from the campe [To go abrode on skirmishing] their kings abiding home. Let gardens breathing out or smel-ling sweet with saffrone flours Entise bees to them, and let the keeper of theeues and birds With willow [wand like] reaping hooke [let him which is] the gard Of Priap borne in Hellespont saue gardens from annoy. [The husbandman] himselfe from lof-tie mounteins bringing thime And pinetree leaues, and he to whom such things are in regard, Let him plant largely round about the houses of the bees [Sweet thime and pinetrees] let him fret or weare away his hand With labouring hard, and let him fast-en frutefull sets in ground, And water them with friendly shores [the better for to grow.] And truly but that I would now draw downe or strike my sailes, A little while before the last end of my toils and pains, And that I would make hast to put my prore into the land: I would perhaps declare what care of husbanding the ground Might beautifie ranke gardens and the rosetrees of [the towne] Pestus [in Calabrie] which bea-reth roses twise a yeare: And how [the hearbe] Intyba should ioine with riuers [moisture] droonk And greenish banks with Apium, and how the Cucumber Writhen among the weeds or hearbs should grow into a bellie, [To haue a bellie:] neither would I haue had held my peace And said nothing of Narcisse [floure] but slowiy bearing leaues; And twigs of Acanth bowd and bent, and iuie pale or white, And myrtle trees louing sea shores [neere to the which they grow.] For I remember I haue seene vnder the loftie towrs Of [Tarent towne] Oebalia cald, where blacke Galesus [floud] Doth wet and water tilled lands, growne yellow [with ripe corne.] An old Corician fellow [of the towne Coricus cald] To whom a few acres of land forsaken [did befall] That soile was neither frutefull for cattell, nor fit for sheepe, Nor seruiceable vnto Bac-chus [for vines bearing grapes]: And yet he planting painfully among the thorns and bushes, Hearbs thinly here and there, with white lillies [set] round about, And Ueraine too with poppie fit for food [or sparely eaten:] This man in mind did match the welth of kings [was thought as rich,] And comming home within late night he furnished his table With meats vnbought: in spring time he did gather roses, and In haruest time apples and frutes: so that when winter sad Did now burst stones with frost and cold, and brideled [staid] with yce The course of waters: then did he part off or cut away Fresh leaues of new sproong Acanth, he rebuking oftentimes The lateward summer, and the loi-tring westerne winds also. Therefore the same [old man was woont] t'abound with breeding bees, With many a swarme likewise, and out of crushed honicombs To gather foming honie, and to him the Tilie tree And pinetree was most plentifull: and with how many frutes Each frutefull tree had clothed it selfe in floure and blossome fresh, So many ripe frutes did that man possesse in haruest time. He also did remoue and set asunder lateward elms [Elms slowly growing] in good sort by leuell and by line. [Elms ranke by ranke or row by row, in order iust and right,] And pearetrees hard, and slo trees bea-ring damsons now [not sloes,] The planetree also giuing shade to folks drinking [therevnder,] But I bard [from the like] by mine vnequall length [of life Or space of time far od to his] do ouerpasse these things, And leaue the same to be rehearst by other men hereafter. Now go to then, I will dispatch [or tell] the qualities Or nature which god Iupeter hath giuen vnto bees, For which reward they following the tinckling sound of the Curetes [folke of Candie land] and ratling basons noise, Haue worshipped the god of heauen in the Dictean caue. The bees alone haue their yoong ones bred common of them all, The houses of their cities they as partners haue and hold, And often lead their liues vnder great lawes and gouernment; They only know their countrie and their certeine dwelling houses, And being mindfull of the win-ter comming they take paines And fall to worke in sommer time; and they lay vp in store Their gettings for the common vse and profit of them all. For some do watch and toile for liuing, and are occupide In feelds vpon a bargaine or a league betweene them made: Some other lay within the bounds or fenses of their houses The iuice of Narcisse, and the clam-mie gum from barke of tree, The first foundation of their ho-nicombs: and afterwards They hang or fasten therevpon wax sticking hard thereto. Some other bring abrode the yoong ones now at perfect growth, The hope of all the flocke [or swarms:] others do thicken the Finest and purest honie, and stretch out the little holes Of their sweet honicombs with ho-ny liquid passing cleere. Others there be vnto whose lot warding at gates befals, And they by turns do watch the raine and tempests of the wether; Or else they take the burthens of the bees then comming home, Or else with armie redie made, they driue away from hiues The drones, a lazie beast: their worke is hot [well plide] and their Sweet sauouring honie giues a smell or casts a sent with thime. And as when the Cyclopes [folke some times of Sicilie] Make vp in hast [Ioues] thunderbolt of softened yron lumps, Some take in wind and let it out againe of bulhide bellowes, Some others dig or quench the his-sing mettals in the water, Ætna doth grone with stilthies set or placed therevpon, They all among themselues lift vp their armes with mighty force In order, and do turne th' yron with pinsers holding fast: None otherwise (if that I may compare small things with great) Doth loue bred in them [loue] of ha-uing honie greatly charge The bees [about] Cecropia [towne] and euery one of them With his owne office. And the towns [or hiues] are a regard Or care vnto the greater growne, to fense their honicombs, To make them houses Dedalan [most cunningly deuisd.] The yoonger bees do get them home weary much within night, Full in the legs of thyme, and they feed euery where vpon [The flours or leaues of] shrubs, and willows greene and gray, And vpon Casia, Safron red, and on ranke Tilie tree, And duskish coloured hyacinthe [of mingled blacke and red.] One rest from worke is vnto all, one labour vnto all, [They all do go to worke at once, and all leaue off at once,] They rush out at the gates in the morning, no wher's delay, Again, when Uesper [th' euening star] hath warnde them at the last Out of the feelds from feeding to depart, then go they home, Then cherish they their bodies, then a noise is made, then they hum Or buz about the bounds, or th' en-trances of all their hiues. Then afterwards when they haue laid themselues at rest in bed, Ther's silence far within the night, and euery bees owne sleepe Possesseth all their weary lims, ne go they far abrode From their abodes, a shoure of raine hanging and like to fall, Or trust vnto the skie at com-ming neere of th' easterne winds, But watered be safe all abouts vnder their citie wals, And do aduenture little walks abrode, and oft take vp Small stones [wherwith they might be born against the force of winds] As wauering botes take grauell in a rough tide tossing them: Herewith they beare them leuell through the void and cloudie aire, Thou wonder wilt this custome to haue pleased bees so much, That they toke not a lewd delight in th' act of breeding yoong, Nor being sluggish let their bo-dies loose to Venus lust, Nor bring foorth yong with pangs and fits; but they do gather vp Their yoong ones with their mouth out of sweet herbs, sweet flours and They make substantially their king and Quirits [courtiers] small, They do reforme their palaces, their waxen realms they stablish, They oft in straieng haue rubd out or worne away their wings Against hard rocks, and willingly haue giuen vp the ghost, [And died] vnderneath their lode: so great a loue of flours So great a pride and praise of making honie [is in them.] Therefore although a space of life but short them interteins (For not more then a seuenth sum-mer it is sayd they liue) Yet neuer dieng doth their race and progenie remaine, The fortune of their house abides and standeth many yeres, And grandfathers of grandfathers are numbred [them among.] Moreouer Ægypt and great Li-dia land, nor people of The Parthians or Hidaspes floud in Media doo not all So much preserue and reuerence their king [as bees do theirs.] The king in safety and good health, one mind is in them all But being lost, they breake their faith, and pull asunder quite The honie hoorded vp in hiues, and loosed, haue [vnbound] Or broken all the frames or wat-tels of their honicombs, [The king bee] he is keeper of the works, at him they wonder, They all stand round about him with a buzzing thicke [or they Stand thicke about him humming] and a great sort met together Gard him, and often lift him vp, and beare him on their shoulders: Their bodies they throw oft into the wars, and do desire A fayre and glorious death by wounds [susteined for his sake.] Some folke by these [aforesaid] signs, and following these examples, Haue said there is a portion of a godlike mind or nature And heauenly spirit [or airie breath and life] in bees [to rest,] For they haue sayd that god doth go through countries al and lands, And tracts or coasts of sea, and th' aire or heauen hie and deepe, That beasts and cattell, men and all the kind of beasts so wild And euery one of them being bred to fetch their breathings thin [Their slender little liues] from hense [from god that's all in all.] Know this [also that they haue said] all things againe to be Restored hither afterwards [ended to be in god] And euery thing resolued [or parted asunder by The separation of the soule and body in a moment] To be surrendred vp againe; nor place to be for death, But all aliue to flie into the number of the stars, And so t'approch and clamber vp into the loftie heauen. If thou wilt empty and vnstop at some conuenient time Their stately seat of treasures, and preserued honie there; First warme thou in thy mouth some draughts of water spurted on, And hold before thee in thy hand smokes following one another: [Before thou take the honie out, spurt water with thy mouth Upon the hiues, that fearing raine they may keepe all within; Then afterwards put smoke to them, till some be chokt and dead, Then maist thou take the honie out, and when the same is gone The swarms may not be suffred to liue all in the hiue, For in the winter they will die and starue for lacke of meat. They gather twise within the yeare [in spring and haruest time] Their great increase and heauie lodes of honie, and they haue Two times of reaping it, that is immediatly when as Taigete Pleias [one of the seuen stars cald Pleiades] Doth show hir faire and honest face vnto the land, and when She hath pusht backe with foot the skor-ned waues of Ocean sea: Or when the same Taigete shun-ning Piscis waterish star, Is gone downe somewhat sad from heauen into wet winters shores. In bees is anger out of woont, and being hurt they spit Out venim at their biting mouths, and leaue blind stings behind Fast sticking in the veins, and in their wounds they put their liues, [For take away their stings, and then their death oft times insues.] But if thou shalt suspect and feare a winter hard and long, And so wilt spare for time to come, and wilt haue pitie of The bruzed harts or courages and broken state [of bees:] What man would doubt then to perfume [&amp; smoke their hiues] w? thime Or else to cut and pare away the void superfluous wax. For oft the newt vnknowne or vn-perceiued eats away The honycombs: and bees are made, or neasts are heaped vp For moths which flie away from light, the drone or waspe also Partaker of no worke, and sitt-ing still at others meat, [Sitting still idle and scotfree, deuouring others food] Or else the stinging hornet hath thrust in himselfe [among The bees] with weapons far vnlike [the weapons of the bees:] Or else a shrewd curst kind of moth, or else the spider fowle, Hated of Pallas, hath hoong vp hir slacke nets at the doors. How much the more the bees shalbe th' emptier, so much they More eagerly will busie be t'amend and to restore The ruins and the losse of their own kind decaid and spent, And will fill vp their hatches [their storehouses or their hiues] And weane or make their [garners] barnes [or honicombs] with flours. If so be that their bodies shall languish and pine away With sicknes sad (because indeede their life but short hath brought Our chances and misfortunes vnto bees) which thing thou maist Perceiue and know by certaine signes and tokens void of doubt: Another colour presently is in them being sicke, Il fauoured leannesse dooth signifie their face and countenance, Then beare they foorth out of their house [or hiues] the bodies of [The bees] which backe both light and life, &amp; moorning burialls make, Or being cloong or clustered together by the feet They hang at th' entringes of the hiue [they hang at th' entrings in Tangled and wrapt about the feet] or else they all abide Loitering within their houses shut, and idle doo become With famishment, and sluggish too with cold procurd and caught, Then is their sound heard heauier and trailingly they hum: Euen as sometimes the cold southwind dooth blow among the woods, And as the troubled sea dooth make a noise with surging waues, And as a fier fearce dooth burne with hollow sound within Shut fornaces or ouens close: here [or in such a case] I will perswade and counsell thee to burne or set on fire The smells [or gums] of Galbanum; and I will counsell thee Emboldening of thine owne accord the wearie bees, and eeke Calling them vnto meats acquainted and well knowne to them, To bring [into their hiues for them] honie in pipes of reeds; It will be profitable eeke to mingle thereunto The bruzd and beaten smell of gall, and roses dride [in sun] Or else new wines boild with much fier [or sod to the third part] Or raison bunches of [the grapes which grow on] Psythian vine, And thime Cecropian, and likewise strong smelling Centaurie. There is also in medow grounds a floure, vnto the which Old husbandmen haue giuen the name Amellum [commonly] An herbe full easie [to be found] of them that seeke [the same,] For it dooth raise a mightie wood [it giueth vp great store Of leaues and stalkes out of one root] out of one greenish turfe, [The floure] it selfe is coloured like gold, but purple hew Of violet blacke dooth somwhat dus-kishly shine in the leaues, Which being very many, are spred round about [the floure] Th' altars of the gods are deckt and garnisht oftentimes With wreaths or garlands knit [or tide together with a threed] The taste thereof is sharpe in mouth: shepherdes doo gather it In vallies mowne [not wooddie] neere vnto the crooked streames Of Mella floud in Gallia. Boile thou in sauorie wine The roots hereof, and set the same as meat [vnto the bees] Euen at the doores of [all] their hiues, in wicker baskets full. But if so be that all the brood shall faile some bodie on The sudden, neither shall he haue [some left] whereof the stocke Of a new race might be calld backe [and kept from cleene decay:] It's time to open and declare th' inuentions and deuises Of Aristey th' Arcadian ma-ster woorth remembring [there,] And by what meanes fowle bloud [vncleane] hath often brought foorth bees In bullocks lately slaine: I will dispatch and quickly shew The whole report from farre, rehear-sing it from first beginning. For [all] the country from that part] wherein the wealthie people Of Canop Pelley [towne] doo dwell hard by the riuer Nile Watering [all Aegipt] with his streames let out [into the land] And carried is about his grounds in painted gallefoistes, And where [the riuer Nile] dooth force the bordering places of [The countrie] Persis armd with bowes and arrowes in their quiuers, And where it maketh frutefull Ae-gypt greene with his blacke sand, And falling with a streame it run-neth diuers waies into Seuen sundrie mouths or entringes in, the riuer being borne Or carried downe perforce by wa-ters [stained] coloured blacke: All that same land dooth lay their health in this same art and trade. A little roome and hired for the turne is chosen first, This doo they close and stop with tiles of narrow ridged house, [Roofe tiles that couer house tops] and with streict and narrow walles, They make thereto foure windowes with the light let in a slope [Not full outright] from all the foure windes [east weast north &amp; south.] Then is a bullocke bowing hornes in forehead two yeares old Sought for his nosetrils twaine and eeke the breathing of his mouth Is stopt, he strugling very much, and killd with blowes and banges His fleshly partes all bruzd and champt are loose and slacke within His skin or hide [in euery place remaining] whole and sound: And so they leaue him lieng in the closet [or shut place] And vnderneath his ribs they lay bowes broken from the tree, And Thime, and Casia fresh and greene [or newly gathered] This feat is doone the westerne windes first driuing water streames, [In the beginning of the spring] yer medow grounds be red With colours fresh, and yer the chattering swallow hangeth vp Hir nest vpon the rafters of the house. In the meane time His moisture being made luke warme within his tender bones Becommeth hot and fries, then beastes to be beheld and seene Are mingled in strange sorts, they lacking at the first their feet, And flickering with their winges anon, and take in more and more Thin aire [they gather life] vntill at last they haue all broke [Out of their hide:] euen like a shoure of [violent] raine powrd out Of summer cloudes, or like to shaftes, the bowstring driuing them, If that the Parthians light of foot at any time doo enter The first conflicts and skirmishes [or giue the first onset.] O muses you tell me what god, what god hath beaten out This art, this running trade for vs, from whense hath this same new Practise or triall [made] of men caught entrance [tooke beginning,] The shepheard Aristey forsaking and auoiding quite Penneian Tempe [paradise in Thessalie, about Which pleasant places run the streames of Peney christall floud] He, when his bees were lost with slaknes and with famishment (As the report dooth go) stood sad and pensife at the head Of this same holie riuer, where it hath the highest rise, [By Pindus hill where he dooth take his first rise or beginning,] Complaining much, and talking to his mother in this speech. O mother mine Cyrene, which doost dwell in and possessest The bottoms deepe of this same gulfe, to what end hast thou bred And borne me hated of the fates and heauenly destinies? [I comming] of the high and noble linage of the gods? (If that Apollo Thimbrey be my father as thou saist And bearest me in hand:) whither, or to what place is thy Loue towardes vs driuen from thee? why didst thou bid me hope For heauen? [to be receiu'd into the number of the gods?] Lo I forsake and leaue, thou being mother vnto me, This present pompe and honour of mens mortall life, the which My skilfull [and my painfull] keeping of frutes and of beastes Had skarsly beaten out for me [prouided for my sake] Proouing and trieng euery thing. But go to if so great An yrksomnes or wearinesse of my renowne hath caught thee [Then] root and pull thou vp with hand the frutefull woods, and bring Into the stalls [for cattell, or into the roomes of store] Mischeefous sier; and kill the corne ripe [redie to be rept] Burne vp yoong plantes new growne, and thrust thy strong two edged knife Or twibill in among my vines [spoile all thinges that I haue.] But [she] his mother did perceiue [and heare a mornefull] sound Under [the channel or] the bed chamber of the deepe floud, The nymphs about hir they did card or toose Milesian fleeses [Wooll of Miletus citie] and stained or died in A deepe and soking colour [like to] glasse, [or died in A colour Saturan like glasse, in Saturum a towne Or citie in Calabria a part of Italie] The nymphs I say, Drymo by name, Pantho and Ligea, And Phyllodoce with their gay and gallant goldilockes Spred all about their necks so white, the nymphs Nyseæ, and Spio, Thalia, Cidipe, and Cymodoce too, And yellow haird Lycoris, th' one a virgin, th' other none. Then hauing tride and felt the first labours of Lucin [or The panges of bearing child, where of Lucina hath the rule,] The nymphs Clio, and Beroe hir sister, and the two Oceanitides [or daugh-ters of Oceanus] Both girt about or clothd in gold and spotted skins [of Hinds] The nymphs Ephire and Asia, Opis and Deiopeia, And Arethusa swift with hir arrows put vp at last: Among which nymphs Clymene told the vaine and needles eare Of Vulcan [for his Venus] and the craftie slights of Mars, And pleasant thefts or stolne delights [twixt bawdie Mars and hir.] And she [Clymene] reckoned vp the thicke [and threefold] loues Of all the gods from Chaos [or from the worlds first beginning, When all thinges were a shapeles lumpe] with which discourse or verse Whiles they being caught with ioy do twist and roll down yarne so soft Upon their spindles, then afresh the lamentation of [The foresaid] Aristeus droue into his mothers cares, And all the nymphes amazed were vpon their glassie seats. But Arethusa she foreseeing thinges before the rest, Did lift hir yellow head aboue the water vppermost, And farr off [thus she spake and sayd:] O Cyren sister mine, Not all in vaine abasht at so a great and groning noise, [Sith Aristey himselfe full sad, thy greatest care to thee Stands weeping at the waters side of Peney [floud] thy father [And his grandfather] and dooth call the cruell [curst] by name. Hereat [Cyrene] mother [of the foresayd Aristey] Smitten in mind with fearfulnes vnwoonted, rare, and strange, Saith [thus to Arethuse,] Go to, bring, bring him vnto vs, It's lawfull for the man to touch the thresholds of the gods [To enter into their abodes] and there withall she bids The riuers deepe to passe away [and to depart from thense] Where [Aristey] the yoongman should set in his foot [and steps.] Then did the water of the floud stand round about the man Bowd crooked in the fashion of a mounteine [steepe] or hill, And interteind or tooke him in his [chanell] bosome huge, And put him vnderneath the streame. And now he went [this way] Much woondering at his mothers house and at hir waterie realms, And at the lakes shut vp in caues, and at the sounding woods, And being made abashed with the mightie moouing of The waters, he beheld all riuers falling vnderneath The great [large] earth and seuered assunder in their places: The riuer Phasis, Lycus floud, from whense Eniphey deepe Breakes out and shews his head at first. [And Aristeus saw] From what place father Tiberine [th' old riuer Tiber flowes] From whense the streames of Amiene riuer doo proceed, And Hypanis making a sound or noise among the stones, And Caiycus which currently dooth run by Mysia land, And eke Erydanus [that floud] golden on both his hornes, And with a bulls face [hauing two bancksides much like two horns, Golden or rich, because thereon great store of cattell feed, Or rather towns and cities stand: bull fast, because it rores Or counterfets a bull in voice, with rough streames in their course:] Than which Erydanus none other riuer flows or runs More violent into the sea of [skie or] purple hewe Through fallow grounds [ranke medowes, by the toile of husbandrie.] After that Aristey] was come within the roofe of the Bed chamber [of Cyrene] hang-ing all with pumish stone, And that she knew the vaine and needles weeping of hir sonne, Hir sisters naturall in or-der giue or serue his handes With faire spring water, and they bring towels with nap shorne off [The floow or roughnes shorne away for feare to hurt his handes,] Some furnisht and doo lode the boord or tables all with meat, And set on pots brimfull afresh: th' altars they grow great And are incenst or set on fier with Panchay [country wood.] And mother Cyren spake and sayd; Take thou these quaffing cups [Full] of Meonian Bacchus [or wine made in Lydia land,] And let vs offer sacrifice to god Oceanus. And herewithall Cyrene prayes to god Oceanus The father of all thinges and to the sisters nymphs also, A hundred which keepe woodes, and eeke a hundred which keep flouds: Thrise powred she and all bewasht the burning Vesta [fire Or sacrifice] with pure sweet wine: and therewithall the flame Being cast vpwardes shined thrise to the top of the house: With which good token [luckie signe, that hir oblation was Receiued of the gods, whose grace was present in that place] She boldening hir mind dooth thus begin [to tell hir tale.] One Proteus a prophet of the sea, is in the gulfe Carpathian [of Carpathos ile confronting Aegipt land] Of Neptuns [realme a portion] which Proteus measures out Or ouerswims the sea so huge [borne] vpon fishes [backes] And in a coch or waggon of two footed horsses yookt: This Proteus now is gone to see the ports of Aencathie, [Th' hauens of Thessalia, and Pallene likewise His natiue countrie, him doo we thy nymphs adore and worship, And so dooth aged Nereus too [the god of th' Ocean seas:] For why, that prophet knowes all thinges: which be, haue bene, &amp; may Prolonged be to come hereafter, or eftsoones, anon, For truly it hath so seemd good to Neptuns grace, whose huge Or monstrous cattell and ill fauoured sea calues he doth feed Under the gulfe. This prophet O my sonne is to be caught [And cast] of thee in bonds before [thou aske him any thing] That he may tell thee redily all causes of diseases, And that he may make prosperous the falling out of thinges: For without force [doone vnto him] he will giue no precepts, [No rules of reason] neither maist him bend or moue by praieng: And therefore lay hard violence vpon him being caught, Constraine and tie him hard with bondes, his vaine deceipts &amp; guiles Shall broken be and void become: by this meanes at the last I mine owne selfe will lead thee in vnto the secret walkes Of th' old man then, when as the sun hath kindled middle heates: [At noonetide] when as hearbes be drie and thirstie, also when The shadow is more welcome and delightfull vnto beastes: Whereto [I meane those secret walkes] th' old man himselfe alone Tired and wearie with the waues withdrawes and takes himselfe, That thou maist easily come vpon him being fast asleepe. But when thou shalt hold and possesse him caught by handes and bonds, Then diuerse shews and likenesses and faces of wild beasts Shall thee beguile: for suddenly he will become a hog Rough brisled, and a tiger blacke, a dragon full of skales, And also a she lion with a darkish yellow necke: Or else he will giue out a shrill and crackling noise of fire, And so will scape out of his bondes, or being slipt aside He will go quite away from thee, into the waters thin. But how much more he shall disguise and change himselfe into All likenesses, so much the more my sonne tie hard his bonds To hold him fast, vntill he shall be such a one [in shape] His body being changed, as thou sawst him [at the first] When as he closd and couered his eyes with sleepe begun: [At thy first comming vpon him when he began to sleepe.] This spake Cyrene, and withall she dasht or cast abrode A sauour of Ambrosia pure [an euerlasting iuce] Wherewith he did annoint and soke the body of hir sonne All ouer, and the sweetish aire or wind [full of the sent] Blew vnto him, this haire therwith being combd and neatly drest: And so an able liuelinesse, or liuely ablenesse Entred and came into his lims. A mightie hole or caue There is in the side of an hill eaten and worne away, Whereto much water driuen is with wind, which water cuts Or parts it selfe in windinges or in turninges beaten backe, [At creekes reflowing, past the which the water cannot go] Which water sometime was a standing or a rode most safe For seamen caught and ouerreacht [in fowle and stormie weather:] Within this [caue] doth Proteus hide himselfe, a stop or let Of a most huge and mightie stone [lieng at mouth thereof.] The nymph [Cyrene] placeth heere the yoong man Aristey Within the lurking hole he be-ing turned from the light, [Standing aside from the caues mouth whereat the light came in,] And she went backe againe farre off darkned with mistie clouds. The [dog star] Sirius extreame hot [and fierie of influence] Did shine like fier in the skie, scortching the thirstie Inds, [A people hot and drie by meanes they are so neere the sun.] The fierie sun likewise had swallowed vp halfe of the world, [Had gone halfe of his daily course, midday was ouerpast] Herbes withered and were drie, the beames [of sun] did boile and seeth The hollow riuers made luke warme euen to the very mud, Their mouthes being drie [and destitute of water to the brims.] And when as Proteus went away out of the flouds, going Unto his woonted caues: the wa-terish nation [fishes] of The sea so huge leaping and skip-ping sprinckled far about Him bitter dew [sea water which is bitter in the taste:] And sundry sea calues lay themselues along vpon the shore A sleepe, [For as they vse the sea, so doo they haunt the land] Then [Proteus he] himselfe sat downe full in the midst [of his [Great troopes of fishes] on a recke, and reckons them by number: Euen as the keeper of a herd sometime dooth count [his beastes] Upon the hills, when th' euening star dooth bring the bullocks home Unto the house from feeding, and when lambs being heard of wolues Doo whet or set their teeth on edge with bleatinges [that they make.] Of [taking] which [sayd Proteus] because there was so fit Occasion and easie leaue offred to Aristey, He scarsly suffred th' old man to refresh his weary lims, [Or lay them downe to take some rest] but rusht vpon him with A great outcrie, and holds him fast with manicles [or bonds Bound fast about his arms and hands] he lieng all along. So [Proteus] not vnmindfull then of his deceiptfull art, On th' other side dooth counterfet, disguise and change himselfe Into all woonderments of thinges [maruelous likenesses] As into fire, dredfull wilde beastes: and riuer running cleere. But when into sight or subtiltie obteind and found him flight, [When he could scape by no deceipt] and being ouercome He came vnto himselfe againe [or tooke his owne right shape] And at the last he spake with the mouth of a very man, And said, O bloudiest of all youth, for who commanded thee To come vnto our dwelling house? or what doost thou fetch hense? But he said; O thou Proteus, thou knowest thy selfe, thou knowest, Ne is it [granted] t'any man t'outreach thee by deceipt: But cease thou and forbeare to will [or to be willing to Beguile me with thy flights, or yet to know why I am come] We hauing followed and obeied the gods commandements Are come vnto this place t'inquire and aske of th' oracles For thinges miscarried and lost. Then hauing sayd so much, The prophet [Proteus] at these wordes [of Aristey] at last With great inforcement rolld his fla-ming eyes with greiesh sight And girning discontentedly, thus opened he his mouth In oracles [he thus began the speeches of the gods.] The wraths of no [base] god but high torments and vexeth thee, Thou purgest and doost wash away fowle faults and great misdeedes. Orphey a miserable man dooth raise vp these same pains. And punishmentes for thee (but that the destinies doo withstand) In no sort after thy desert [which hast deserued more] And he dooth rage most greeuously for his wife caught away, Whiles he indeede all headlong fled away from thee through flouds, The yoong wife [but a wench in years] being neere vnto hir death, Saw not among the weeds high growne [euen full] before hir feet, [When she lookt backwards vpon thee] an adder measurelesse Keeping the water banks [that none should come vnto the shore:] So that the company of [nymphs cald] Driads of like age [With Orpheis wife] did fill the high-est mounteins with their crie, The Rhodopean hils did weepe, and high Pangean tops, And Mars his countrie [in posses-sion now] of Rhesus [king,] The Gets [a people and the floud cald] Hebrus, and also Orithia Actias [an Athenien nymph was she: All these bewaild Eurydice the wife of Orpheus,] He then asswaging eager loue [his loue tormenting full] With hollow lute or citerne [made first of a tortoise shell:] O sweet wife he did sing of thee, of thee on shore alone, Of thee at day [light] comming, and of thee at day departing, This Orpheus entred [first] into the mouths Tenarian, [The gaping holes of Tenarus, a brow of land that iuts Into or ouerhangs the sea, and leadeth downe to hell] The doors [or dongeons deepe] of Dis [or Pluto god of feends] And so into a wood all darke with fearefull blacknesse, and Then went he to the spirits and ghosts, and to the dreadfull king, And so to harts that know not to wax gentle at mens praiers. But yet the slender shadows [ghosts] being mou'd with Orpheis song, Did go out of the lowermost seats of Erebus [or hell] So did the likenesses of folks lacking the light [of life, In count as many] as many thousand of birds do hide Themselues in woods, when th' euening or a wet and winters shoure Doth driue them from the hils. These [ghosts] are mothers, women wiues, And husbands, and the bodies of couragious noble men Dischargd of life, and boies also, and wenches neuer wedded, And yoong men put in kindled fires, before their parents faces: All which the blacke and durty mud, and foule ill fauoured reeds Of Cocit riuer, and the fen not to be ouerflowne, [Louelesse or vnbeloued] for his water flow and dull, Dooth bind and tie in round about, and Stix [that hellish] lake Pourd nine times in, or through nine rounds or circles holdeth in. Moreouer, the hellish houses were astonnied, and so were The lowest [deepest] Tartar [dark dongeons] of ougly death: So were the [feends] Eumenides, hauing their haire be wrapt And tangled all with blewish snakes; and gaping Cerberus [The cur of hell] kept his three mouths from yolping, and the wheele Of Ixion turning round [stird not] but stood still with the wind. Now Orphey pulling backe his foot [out of th' infernall realme] Had scaped all misfortunes, and Eurydice [his wife] Was giuen to him againe; she came abrode in th' open aire Following hir husband close behind (for why Proserpina The queene of hell and hellish hags had giuen out this law) When as a sudden sottishnesse or follie had surprizd And caught th' unwary louer fast; a sottishnesse indeed To be forgiuen and pardoned, if spirits knew to forgiue. He stood still loitered] and alacke vnmindfull man was he, And being ouercome in mind he looked backe vpon Eurydice now [knowne] his [wife] somewhat before full light, [So soone as he was come within the glymps of any light] There all his [former] labour was quite ouerthrowne and lost, The couenants of th' unmercifull tyrant [foule Pluto] burst, A cracking noise or broken crie [of voices altogether] Was heard three times fr? th' Auerne flouds [infernal standing waters] For now the feends reioised at Eurydices returne, That they might heare old Orphey twang and sing vnto his lute. Then she [perceiuing that she was going to hell againe Cride out and] said; O Orphey, who hath cast me wretch away? Who hath vndone thee sillie man? what madnesse, ah! so great? Lo cruell destnies call me backe againe, and sleepe [of death] Doth hide my swimming [dazeling] eies: and Orphey now farewell, For I being compast with a great night [or a darknesse thicke] Am borne away; and reaching out to thee, alacke not thine, [No more thy wife] my feeble hands, said she: and therewithall Eurydice did passe away and vanish out of sight Upon the sudden into th' aire, as thin and slender smoke Mingled [with wind] doth flit away [and scatter] diuers waies: Ne saw she Orphey afterwards oft catching at hir ghost In vaine [or to no purpose] and right willing to say much: Ne did the ferriman of hell [Charon of Orcus floud] Suffer this Orphey any more t'ouerpasse the lake Laid full against [or iust betweene the liuing and the dead.] What should he do? and whither should he beare himselfe on foot? His wife being taken twise away: with what lamenting should He moue the feends? or with what voice [should he intreat] the gods? She truly swam now cold [and wan] in Stygian ferribote. [Writers] auouch and say that he mourned full seuen months In order [without rest] vnder a loftie rocke in th' aire, Next to the water of the floud Strymon, forsaken [quite Of people, by the means of fens which often drowne the land; And they report] that he disclosd and vttered all these things Under the cold and frosen caues, delighting with his song The tigers [beasts vntamable] and making okes to moue. [So wayled Orphey] as the dole-full [mourning] nightingale Under the shadow of a pop-pler tree lamenteth much Hir yoong ones lost, whom plowman hard [of hart] obseruing and Watching, drew forth out of their neasts vnfledgd and fetherlesse: But she [the dam] doth waile all night, and sitting on the bough [From whense the neast was had] she doth renew hir note afresh, And fils the places all abrode with hir mourning complaints: No Venus [lust] no Hymeneis [new marriages] haue moou'd Hir mind [the nightingals,] nor his, [Orpheis] who all alone Did wander round about the [nor-therne] Hyperborean yse [Or toasts hard frozen with the cold, and full of ysie flakes] And Tanais floud all snowish [or all ouerlaid with snow] And grounds at no time void of frosts vpon Riphean hils, Lamenting his Euridice taken by force away, And for the gifts of Dis made void [alacke by looking backe] With which said gift [to wit a wife] the mothers [women] of The Cicones [of Thracia a people] being skornd And much despisd [of Orphey] they did drag and scatter him, Being as then a youth torne all to peeces, ouer the Wild feelds among the sacrifi-ces of the gods, and the Night ceremonies [holy rites] of Bacchus, at what time The floud Hebrus Oeagrius carrieng this Orpheis head Pluckt from his whitish marble necke, did roll and tumble it In the midst of the gulfe: his voice and toong both cold and wan Did call Eurydice, alacke Eurydice poore wretch, Hir sillie soule flitting away: the banks did sound againe, [Did beat backe with a great rebound the name] Eurydice All ouer Hebrus floud [where Or-pheis head did swim aflote.] These words spake Proteus, and therewith he did betake himselfe Into the deepe sea with a fling; and where he did be take Himselfe, there turnd he round the foming water vnder the Crowne of his head [or vnderneath the winding of the streame.] But so did not Cyrene, for she of hir owne accord Spake vnto fearefull [Aristey,] O thou my sonne [said she] It's lawfull for to put away sad cares out of thy mind: She [of whom Protey spake] is all the cause of sicknesses: The nymphs also, with whom she prac-tisd danses in hie woods, Haue sent destruction herevpon among bees; thou therefore An humble sutor crauing peace [a poore petitioner] Reach out thy presents and thy gifts [or offer sacrifice] And worship thou the gentle Napes [the nymphs of flours and plants] For they will giue good leaue vnto thy wishes and desires, [Grant thy requests] and will asswage and qualifie their wrath. But I will tell thee first what should or ought to be the maner Or fashion of beseeching and praieng to them in order. Choose out aside foure speciall ox-en [bullocks of the] best, Of body peerelesse [excellent] and as many yoong kine With necke vntoucht [of yoke] which now do feed [are fed] for thee Upon the tops of Licey mount greene [growne and full of grasse:] Reare vp also and place thou foure altars for those same beasts Neere to the shrined temples of the goddesses, and then Let foorth the sanctified blood out of their throtes, and leaue The bodies of the bullocks in the wood full of greene leaues, And after when the ninth morning shall shew hir risings vp, Thou shalt send vnto Orpheus some ghostly sacrifice, [Namely] forgetfull poppie [which doth cause forgetfulnesse] And thou shalt kill a blacke sheepe, and shalt go to see the wood, And shalt worship Euridice appeasd with a slaine cow. [There was] no lingring or delay, but Aristey forth with Goes to dispatch his mothers heasts and hir commandements: He commeth to the shrined tem-ples, and he reareth vp Th' altars shewne and told him [of his mother as before:] He brings foure speciall oxen all of bodie excellent, And as many yoong kine with necke vntoucht [of any yoke] Then after, when the ninth morning had brought hir risings vp [The ninth day following being come] Aristey sent vnto Orphey a ghostly sacrifice, and went and saw the wood. Here Aristey [and they with him] behold a sudden monster [Bred suddenly] and woonderfull to be declard and told. Bees for to buz and make a noise within and all about The kines and oxens bowels, which were molten [putrifide, Corrupt and rotten ouer all their bellie or their banch] And with a heat to flie out of their broken ribs or sides, And mightie clouds [or swarms of bees] together to be drawne, And presently to meete in heapes, and flocke on top of trees, And to let fall from bending boughes a cluster [of yoong bees.] I [Virgill] did declare in verse these thinges concerning the Good husbanding of fallow feelds, of cattell also, and Concerning trees, whiles Cæsar great smites downe with thunderbolts In battell [all his enimies] by deepe Euphrates floud, And being conquerour he dooth giue out lawes through people all Willing [t'obey him,] and prepares his way t' Olympus [hill, He longeth and he lusteth for the path to paradise] Parthenope [now Naples] sweete did nourse and foster me, At that same time [of Cæsars wars] me Virgill flourishing In exercises honourles of quiet rest and ease, [How honourles? euen in regard of Cæsars warlike praise.] [I am the man] which plaid [or writ in toiesh plaieng sort] The verses of playne shepheards and [eeke I am very he] Which [hauing] hardie [beene] and bold, in my yoong age haue soong Of thee O Tityr [lieng] vnder shade of spreading beech.
