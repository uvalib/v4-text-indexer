      <field name="fulltext">RHYMES. THE BLIND BOY'S PRANKS. [“The following beautiful Stanzas are by a correspondent, who subscribes himself ‘A Serf,’ and declares that he has to weave fourteen hours out of the four-and-twenty. We trust his daily toil will soon be abridged, that he may have more leisure to devote to an art in which he shows so much natural genius and cultivated taste.”—Aberdeen Herald, Feb. 1841.] “I'll tell some ither time, quo'he, How we love an' laugh in the north countrie.” Legend. Men grew sae cauld, maids sae unkind, Love kentna whaur to stay. Wi' fient an arrow, bow, or string,— Wi' droopin' heart an' drizzled wing, He faught his lanely way. “Is there nae mair, in Garioch fair, Ae spotless hame for me? Hae politics, an' corn, an' kye, Ilk bosom stappit? Fie, O fie! I'll swithe me o'er the sea.” He launched a leaf o' jessamine, On whilk he daured to swim, An' pillowed his head on a wee rosebud, Syne laithfu', lanely, Love 'gan scud Down Ury's The Ury, a small stream, at the junction of which with the Don stands Inver Ury.waefu' stream. The birds sang bonnie as Love drew near, But dowie when he gaed by; Till lull'd wi' the sough o' monie a sang, He sleepit fu' soun' and sailed alang 'Neath Heav'n's gowden sky! 'Twas just whaur creeping Ury greets Its mountain cousin Don, There wandered forth a weelfaur'd deme, Wha listless gazed on the bonnie stream, As it flirted an' played with a sunny beam That flickered its bosom upon. Love happit his head, I trow, that time, The jessamine bark drew nigh, The lassie espied the wee rosebud, An' aye her heart gae thud for thud, An' quiet it wadna lie. “O gin I but had yon wearie wee flower That floats on the Ury sae fair!” She lootit her hand for the silly rose-leaf, But little wist she o' the pawkie thief, That was lurkin' an' laughin' there! Love glower'd when he saw her bonnie dark e'e, An' swore by Heaven's grace He ne'er had seen, nor thought to see, Since e'er he left the Paphian lea, “Paphos, a very ancient city of Cyprus. It was celebrated for its beautiful temple of Venus, built on the spot where she landed when she rose from the sea. There were one hundred altars in her temple, which smoked daily, with a profusion of frankincense, and though exposed to the open air, they were never wetted by rain. Annual festivals were held here in honour of the goddess, and her oracle, which was connected with the temple, acquired for it considerable reputation.” [So here it was that this same little urchin Cupid, imbibed a taste for bow-bending; and getting thereat so expert, and withal so troublesome, it was resolved by certain infirm gods and ugly goddesses to do for him. One night then, when Venus his mother was invisible (Adonis had been skulking in a wood close by) the aforementioned divinities laid hands on master Mischief—“skelpit”him rarely—ordered father Time to clip the little rascal's wings, and lay him down somewhere about the Gairoch. Here he wandered so long and wept so sorely, that his “blear'd een” obtained for him the name of the “Blind Boy.”] Sae lovely a dwallin' place! Syne, first of a', in her blythesome breast He built a bower, I ween; An' what did the waefu' devilick neist? But kindled a gleam like the rosy east, That sparkled frae baith her een. An' then beneath ilk high e'e bree He placed a quiver there; His bow? What but her shinin' brow? An' O sic deadly strings he drew Frae out her silken hair. Guid be our guard! sic deeds waur deen, Roun' a' our countrie then; An' monie a hangin' lug was seen 'Mang farmers fat, an' lawyers lean, An' herds o' common men! THE BLIND BOY'S PRANKS. No. II. Love roam'd awa frae Uryside, Wi' bow an' barbet keen, Nor car'd a gowan whaur he gaed; “Auld Scotland's mine, howe, heath, and glade, And I'll trock that wi' nane. “Yon Ury damsel's diamond e'e, I've left it evermair; She gied her heart unkent to me; Now prees what wedded wichts maun pree, When I'm unpriested there. “That time by Ury's glowing stream, In sunny hour we met; A lichter beild, a kinder hame Than in the breast o' that fair dame, I'll never, never get. “I kenn'd her meet wi' kindly say, A lov'd, a lowly name; The heartless ruled poor Jean—an' they Hae doom'd a loveless bride, for aye To busk a loveless hame. “I'll seek bauld Benachie's proud pow, Grey king of common hills! And try hoo bodies' hearts may lowe Beneath thy shadeless, shaggy brow, Whaur dance a hundred rills.” Now trampin' bits, now fleein' miles, Frae aff the common road, To keek at cadgers loupin' stiles, Wha try the virtue an' the wiles Of maidens lichtly shod. He passed Pittodrie's haunted wood, Among the many pretty legends and stories that affix to almost every hill and water, wood and howe of the Garioch, the following is often heard: —Upon a time far, far gone by, a Caledonian demon took a fancy, to amuse himself awhile in the neighbourhood of Benachie—a portion of our world he had scarcely looked upon since the bloody game of Harlaw. To put matters astirring again in his own way, he took a stroll into the woods of Pittodrie. There let him walk, while we take a hasty look at those upon whom he is said to have recommenced his dark doings. The boasted beauty of five parishes was the “Maiden of Drumdurno.” A farmer's only daughter she—a cantie, clever, hame-bred Scotch lassie. Three notions, in particular, appear to have held uppermost keeping in her bonnie brow—to wit, that her father had the sharpest outlook, Benachie the highest tap, and her ain Jamie, the kindest heart in the whole world. Aware (and why not?) of her own personal loveliness, she wisely made all within as fair and fitting. She lived a creature full of soul—her breast the tenement of love and happiness—gaiety and tenderness hovered in her eye, like watchful spirits, ready to minister—waiting, as it were, just to see what was wanted—a laugh or a tear. Many, many had wooed—one, at last, had won her. The unsuccessful went, each according to his way, in these cases—some sighing, some drawing comfort from a new purpose, some from an old pipe—all, however, wishing happy days to the betrothed “Maiden of Drumdurno.” One alone—one fed the hope of vengeance—one grim, horse-shoe-hearted rascal of a smith. Parish smith and precentor, too, he was. This rejected ruffian watched that night in Pittodrie woods, in thought that “Jamie” would, as usual, in leaving Drumdurno, pass that way. “Oh, that my eternal destruction could plague their earthly peace,” cried he, “how soon and sure the bargain would be mine!”“Capital wish!” cried the seducer of Eve, “I'll do the thing for you on your own conditions.” Perpetual vassalage on the part of the “red wud” smith— written desolation to the luckless lovers of Drumdurno, was compact and settlement that night, in the black woods of Pittodrie. —The bonniest and the blythest lass within sight of Benachie was drifting up the bridal baking—and the bridal and the bannocks “baith her ain.” “It sets ye weel to work, lass, gin ye had onie mair speed at it.” This compound of taunt and compliment was uttered by a stranger, who had been hanging on about the kitchen, the last hour or so—a queer, rollicking, funny, lump of a “roader,” and, by his own story, in search of work. “I kenna whether it sets me or no,” quoth the maiden, “but I think nane could grudge wi' my speed.” It is clear by this, that the complimentary portion of the stranger's remark had found its way. Alas! the pitiable truth! Alas! for humanity! When it would be flattered, the poison is more surely imparted beneath the roughest coverture. In faulting that which is blameless, the flatterer assumes the hue and weight of honesty, and works securely there. The jest and banter was exchanged, with mingled glee and earnestness, till at length the lass, all thoughtlessly, was inveigled into the fatal wager. The terms of that fearful agreement are stated at varied points of the horrible. The most temperate reciters insist that HE undertook to “lay” a road from bottom to top of Benachie ere she baked up her firlot of meal. The forfeiture hazarded on his part is not on record. Most likely the light-hearted, happy bride regarded the whole as one of the merry jokes that rang from that merry old man, and heeded not exacting conditions in a matter she conceived to be impossible. Her part of the pledge, however, was, “that she became his own if the road is laid ere the meal be baken.” —Now, now, the last bannock is on the girdle, but for the past hour her mind was filling, in the gush of that tearful sweetness that pours o'er the heart of a willing bride, so the hill, the road, the wager, old man and all—all were forgotten—all overshaded that shared of earth—but one—one only, one darling thought. The hour of tryst was near. The lowering, gloomy-like fall of the night dismayed her, and she looked wistfully at the cloud settling on the hill. “Its nae that, nor mony siclike 'll gar him bide frae me; but I'm wae to see him weet. God of my heart,” she cried, “what's yon I see!” —The road is to be seen to this day. She fled towards the woods of Pittodrie, pursued. The prayer she could not utter was answered. With the last bound the demon grasped a stone. Such the transformed bride. So she stands there even now. And quick the pace, and quick the pulse, Wha wanders there alane, Atween Pittodrie's drearie wood An' the dowie “maiden's stane.” Whaur devils dwalt langsyne; He heard the Ury's timid flood, An' Gadie's heigh an' hurrit scud, In playfu' sweetness twine. An' there he saw (for Love has een, Tho' whiles nae gleg at seein') He saw an' kenn'd a kind auld frien', Wha wander'd ghaistlike an' alane, Forsaken, shunn'd, an' deein'. Her looks ance gay as gleams o' gowd Upon a silvery sea; Now dark an' dowie as the cloud That creeps awthart yon leafless wood, In cauld December's e'e. Hear ye the heartsick soun's that fa' Frae lips that bless nae mair? Like beildless birdies when they ca' Frae wet, wee wing the batted snaw, Her sang soughs o' despair. SONG OF THE FORSAKEN. My cheek is faded sair, love, An' lichtless fa's my e'e; My breast a' lane and bare, love, Has aye a beild for thee. My breast, though lane and bare, The hame o' cauld despair, Yet ye've a dwallin' there, A' darksome though it be. Yon guarded roses glowin', Its wha daur min't to pu'? But aye the wee bit gowan Ilk reckless hand may strew. An' aye the wee, wee gowan, Unsheltered, lanely growin', Unkent, uncared its ruin, Sae marklessly it grew. An' am I left to rue, then, Wha ne'er kent Love but thee; An' gae a love as true, then, As woman's heart can gie; But can ye cauldly view, A bosom burstin' fu'? An' hae ye broken noo, The heart ye sought frae me? THE BLIND BOY'S PRANKS. No. III. By the lowe o' a lawyer's ingle bricht, Wi' gruesome looks an' dark, The Deil sat pickin' his thum's ae nicht Frae evendoun want o' wark. At length in the learn'd lug to hark He cannilie screw'd him roun', Syne claw'd his elbow an' leuch to mark The lang-leaft buik brocht doun. Wi' outshot een, o'er leaf an' line, Sae keenly did they leuk, An' oh! there was ae waefu' sign Within that wearie buik, Whan Hornie gae his mou a cruik An' whisper'd, “Look ye, here's A crafter A crofter is one who holds a four or five acre piece of land, and house.carl upon our hook Ahint these twa ‘ha'f years.’ “Gae harry him, man, an' gar him dee, The lave is your's an' mine; His daisy dochter's scornfu' e'e Will blink less saucy syne. In beinless wa's just lat her pine, Sic lanesome hardships pree; An' here's my loof the haughty quean Will fa' afore she flee.” Love heard, an' scunnert wi' the plot Swore grey the very moon, That he would hae the lawyer shot, An' gar the deevil droun. He flaft his wing o'er brae, an' boun' O'er field and forest wide; In lawly biggin lichted doun An' knelt by Annie's side. O, whaur is love maist lovely seen? In timorous glances stealing— Half-hid, half-own'd in diamond e'en The soul-fraught look revealing? No; see it there—a daughter kneeling A father's sickbed near, With uprais'd heart to heaven appealing, That—that's the look for angel's wear! Annie, sic look was thine that nicht, Yon waesome watchfu' hour; The man o' buiks thow'd at the sicht— He tint a' pith an' pow'r. Auld Hornie then forthwith 'gan scour By heicht an' howe—an' then At Cardin's brig Cardin's brig over the Gadie, to the west of Logie, Elphinstone.he tumbl't o'er An' never raise again. The lanefu' lawyer held his breath, An' word micht utter nane; But lookit aye—grew aye mair laith To blaud her bonnie een. Love threw a shaft, sae sure an' keen, It trembled in his heart; An' micht I deem, altho' a stane Had dwallin' in the part. Syne, slow an' dowie, wending hame, Wi' cares unkent afore, His heart a' sinkin' doun wi' shame— Wi' new love gushin' o'er. By buik or bond he held nae store, For bound eneuch was he; Nor could he read aucht ither lore Than beam'd in yon bricht e'e. A saftness hangs on ilka word; A wish on ilka hour; A sang is soucht fra' every bird, A sich frae every flower. Now briefs forsaken, rot an' sour— A sonnet rules a summons; E'en Blackstone's weighty wit maun cour To far mair weighty woman's. LINES OCCASIONED BY THE SUDDEN DEATH OF COUNT JOHN LESLIE OF BALQUHAIN AND FETTERNEIR. August, 1844. Beloved by all—cut off in the dawn of manhood—he was borne to the grave by a weeping tenantry. Oh, why? but God alone knows why— Do churls cling aye to earth; While the brave and the just, and the generous die, The hour that owns their worth? Alas! and woe!—so sad—so true, The blink that's brightest—briefest too. 'T was a dolefu' dawn yon morning saw On the turrets of brown Balquhain; When the Leslie lay on red Harlaw “Wi' his six good sons a' slain.” In 1411, Donald of the Isles marched towards Aberdeen, the inhabitants of which were in dreadful alarm at the near approach of this marauder and his fierce hordes: but their fears were allayed by the speedy appearance of a well-equipped army, commanded by the Earl of Mar, who bore a high military character, assisted by many brave knights and gentlemen in Angus and the Mearns. Advancing from Aberdeen, Mar marched by Inverury, and descried the Highlanders stationed at the village of Harlaw, on the water of Ury near its junction with the Don. Mar soon saw that he had to contend with tremendous odds, but although his forces were, it is said, as one to ten to that opposed to him, he resolved, from the confidence he had in his steel-clad knights, to risk a battle. Having placed a small but select body of knights and men-at-arms in front, under the command of the constable of Dundee and the sheriff of Angus, the Earl drew up the main strength of his army in the rear, including the Murrays, the Straitons, the Maules, the Irvings, the Lesleys, the Lovels, the Stirlings, headed by their respective chiefs. The Earl then placed himself at the head of this body. At the head of the Islesmen and Highlanders was the Lord of the Isles, subordinate to whom were Mackintosh and Maclean and other Highland chiefs, all bearing the most deadly hatred to their Saxon foes. On a signal being given, the Highlanders and Islesmen, setting up those terrific shouts and yells which they were accustomed to raise on entering into battle, rushed forward upon their opponents: but they were received with great firmness and bravery by the knights, who, with their spears levelled, and battle-axes raised, cut down many of their impetuous but badly armed adversaries. After the Lowlanders had recovered themselves from the shock which the furious onset of the High-landers had produced, Sir James Scrymgeour, at the head of the knights and bannerets who fought under him, cut his way through the thick columns of the Islesmen, carrying death everywhere around him: but the slaughter of hundreds by this brave party did not intimidate the Highlanders, who kept pouring in by thousands to supply the place of those who had fallen. Surrounded on all sides, no alternative remained for Sir James and his valorous companions but victory or death, and the latter was their lot. The constable of Dundee was amongst the first who suffered, and his fall so encouraged the Highlanders, that seizing and stabbing the horses, they thus unhorsed their riders, whom they despatched with their daggers. In the mean time the Earl of Mar, who had penetrated with his main army into the very heart of the enemy, kept up the unequal contest with great bravery, and, although he lost during the action almost the whole of his army, he continued the fatal struggle with a handful of men till nightfall. The disastrous result of this battle was one of the greatest misfortunes which had ever happened to the numerous respectable families in Angus and the Mearns. Many of these families lost not only their head, but every male in the house. Andrew Lesley, third Laird of Balquhain, is said to have fallen, with six of his sons (the Laurus Lesleana says eleven, and that he himself fell some years after in a battle at Brakoe, killed by the sheriff of Angus, 1420.) Isabel Mortimer, his wife, founded a chaplainry in the Chapel of Garioch, and built a cross called Leslie's Cross, to their memory. Besides Sir James Scrymgeour, Sir Alexander Ogilvy, the sheriff of Angus, with his eldest son George Ogilvy, Sir Thomas Murray, Sir Robert Maule of Panmure, Sir Alexander Irving of Drum, Sir William Abernethy of Salton, Sir Alexander Straiton of Lauriston, James Lovel, and Alexander Stirling, and Sir Robert Davidson, provost of Aberdeen, with five hundred men-at-arms, including the principal gentry of Buchan, and the greater part of the burgesses of Aberdeen who followed their provost, were among the slain. The Highlanders left nine hundred men dead on the field of battle, including the chiefs, Maclean and Mackintosh. This memorable battle was fought on the eve of the feast of St. James the Apostle, the 24th day of July, in the year 1411, “and from the ferocity with which it was contested, and the dismal spectacle of civil war and bloodshed exhibited to the country, it appears to have made a deep impression on the national mind. It fixed itself in the music and poetry of Scotland; a march, called ‘the Battle of Harlaw,’ continued to be a popular air down to the time of Drummond of Hawthornden, and a spirited ballad, on the same event, is still repeated in our age, describing the meeting of the armies, and the deaths of the chiefs, in no ignoble strain.” Mar and the few brave companions in arms who survived the battle, were so exhausted with fatigue and the wounds they received, that they were obliged to pass the night on the field of battle, where they expected a renewal of the attack next morning; but when morning dawned, they found that the Lord of the Isles had retreated, during the night, by Inverury and the hill of Benachie. To pursue him was impossible, and he was therefore allowed to retire, without molestation, and to recruit his exhausted strength. The site of the battle is thus described in the manuscript Geographical Description of Scotland collected by Macfarlane, and preserved in the Advocates' Library [Vol. i. p. 7.]: “Through this parish (the Chapel of Garioch, formerly called Capella Beatæ Mariæ Virginis de Garryoch) runs the king's highway from Aberdeen to Inverness, and from Aberdeen to the high country. A large mile to the east of the church lies the field of an ancient battle called the battle of Harlaw, from a country town of that name hard by. This town, and the field of battle, which lies along the king's highway upon a moor, extending a short mile from south-east to north-west, stands on the northeast side of the water of Urie, and a small distance therefrom. To the west of the field of battle, about half a mile, is a farmer's house called Legget's Den, hard by, in which is a tomb, built in the form of a malt-steep, of four large stones, covered with a broad stone above, where, as the country people report, Donald of the Isles lies buried, being slain in the battle, and therefore they call it commonly Donald's Tomb.” This is an evident mistake, as it is well known that Donald was not slain. Mr. Tytler conjectures with much probability that the tomb alluded may be that of the chief of Maclean or Mackintosh, and he refers, in support of this opinion, to Macfarlane's Genealogical Collections, in which an account is given of the family of Maclean, and from which it appears that Lauchlan Lubanich had, by Macdonald's daughter, a son, called Eachin Rusidh ni Cath, or Hector Rufus Bellicosus, who commanded as lieutenantgeneral under the Earl of Ross at the battle of Harlaw, when he and Irving of Drum, seeking out one another by their armorial bearings on their shields, met and killed each other. This Hector was married to a daughter of the Earl of Douglas. But nane less leal the sigh and the tear, And the waesome hearts 'round Fetterneir. Don's waters deftly wandered on, Sae wantonly and sae clear; And dazzling danced beneath the sun That gleam'd o'er Fetterneir.

But away and away—he bodes a bier, For the woods look fay 'round Fetternier. Fetterneir, once a summer seat of the bishops of Aberdeen. Wallace is said to have slept there one night; hence part of it is called Wallace's Tower. At the Reformation this manor was given to the Lesleys of Balquhain (pronounced Balwine), for their assistance to the Earl of Huntly in protecting the Cathedral of Aberdeen from the fury of the Reformers. It is the burial-place of the Lesleys. The family of the Lesleys is five hundred and eighty years' standing; Sir George, the founder, having got the lands of Balquhain from King David the Second in 1340. There had been four counts of this family, the last now living (1650) at the Emperor's court. The first of these counts was Walter, youngest son to John, tenth laird of Balquhain, by his third wife, who having, in A.D. 1634, killed Count Wallenstein, the Emperor's general, was made a colonel of the Guards, created Count Lesley, Field Marshal, Privy Councillor, Governor of Sclavonia, and by Leopold the First sent ambassador to Constantinople, having just before been made Knight of the Golden Fleece. He died in 1667, at Vienna. About half a mile to the south-east of the church is to be seen the old ruinous Castle of Balquhain. In it Queen Mary spent a day on her journey to the north, which terminated in the battle of the Corrichie. The only remains of the building are a few shattered fragments of the court or quadrangle of which it at one time consisted, and the noble square tower or keep, which was erected about the year 1530 to replace the more ancient castle, which had been burned down in a memorable feud with the Forbeses in the year 1526.

The nobler Spider It was at Inverury, after losing seven battles against the English, that Robert Bruce, lying ill in his bed, marked a spider, which was endeavouring to mount to the ceiling, fall down seven times, but on the eighth attempt succeed. The Scotch and English army were just preparing for battle, when Bruce, inspired by this omen, rose, and heading his dispirited troops, after a desperate struggle succeeded in routing the enemy, and laid the foundation of a series of successes against the usurping invader, which secured the glory and independence of the kingdom of Scotland. The welcome he received at Inverury, in his dark hour of distress, induced him to bestow on it the privileges of a royal burgh. Nor is this the only time that the spider has influenced the destiny of kingdoms.

In all things near, or sight or sounds, Sepulchral rottenness abounds; Yet he, the sovereign filth, will prate, In stilted terms, of Church and State, As things that he would mould anew— Could all but his brute self subdue.

Oh, may all The self-twined lash unbroken fall, Nor hold until our land is free'd Of craven, crouching slugs, that breed In fetid holes, and, day by day, Yawn their unliving life away! But die they will not, cannot—why? They live not—therefore, cannot die. In soul's dark deadness dead are they, Entomb'd in thick corkswollen clay.

THE MANIAC MOTHER'S DREAM. When sunlight leaves the lea, And songless birds would rest, When sleeping dews there be Upon the gowan's breast— Who, like the dark'ning west, That lone one? Who is she? 'Tis Sorrow's fated guest, And this her revelry:— Through crumbling tombs, o'er boneless graves, The wrathful wind in that hour that raves, Shall, mingling, mingling, moan and sigh, To the maniac mother's lullaby; While cow'ring 'neath the ruined wall Of Elgin's dark Cathedral. This Venerable and magnificent relic of cathedral grandeur is situated in Elgin, Morayshire, on the banks of the river Lossie. It was built early in the thirteenth century. About a hundred and fifty years after the foundation, it was entirely burned down by the ruffian son of a Scottish king. the creature— a common destroyer—lives yet in hateful record, as “The Wolf of Badenoch.” “The cathedral is surrounded by a burying-ground, one of the largest churchyards, perhaps, in Great Britain. In it are interred the remains of many distinguished persons, including several of the kings of Scotland. The churchyard is enclosed by a stone wall. What with the number of graves, the beauty and variety of the sculptured memorials of departed worth and greatness, and the grandeur of the dilapidated cathedral—a building which is, indeed, pre-eminently magnificent, even in ruins—the scene is calculated to make a strong impression on the spectator.” It is not all of its early grandeur, nor of its later desolation, its splendour nor its ruin—not all the historian has told or antiquarian minuted—will impart an interest to the spot, like what it derives now from a maniac—an outcast mother and her orphan boy. It fell out thus:—In 1745, Marjory Gillan, a young woman, resided in Elgin—she was well connected and good-looking—was privately married to a young man who had enlisted in a regiment then quartered in the town—she went abroad with her husband, followed by the bitter reproach of her relatives and friends, who considered the step she had taken a discredit and an affront to all connected. In the same spirit of unrelenting harshness was she received on her return, which occurred about two years from the time she left. It was rumoured that her husband had used her ill, had left her behind, and was killed in battle. The forlorn one now sought her homeless native place, unsettled in mind, and carrying a baby in her arms. “The reception she met with, and the wild fancies of a wandering mind, induced her to take a strange step. Amidst the crumbling ruins of the cathedral, there is one chamber still entire; a small, cellar-like room, about five feet square, with scarcely any light, and which is said, in ancient times, to have been the sacristy, or place for keeping the vessels used in the offices of religion. Here the poor outcast took up her abode, rendered insensible, by her obscured reason, to the nocturanl horrors of a place which, in a better state of mind, she would have dreaded to approach after dusk. There was in this room an ancient sculptured font, which she used as a bed to her infant; other furniture she had none. When it was known that she had gone to reside in this dismal place, the people felt as if it were an imputation against their Christian feelings. She and her babe were repeatedly carried, by some one or other of them, to their houses, but she always made her way back to the sacristy. At length, finding her determined to live there, they contented themselves with giving her food and alms, and for several years she wandered about with her boy, under the appellation of ‘Daft May Gilzean’ The z in this name is not pronounced.—a harmless creature, that wept and sang by turns. Her lover or husband was no more heard of in the country, although he had several relations living in the neighbourhood, with whom he might have been expected to correspond, if he had remained in life. Andrew Anderson, the son of May Gilzean, grew up in all the raggedness and misery which might be expected under such circumstances to fall to his lot. It is questionable if he ever knew the comforts of a bed, or of a cooked meal of any kind, till his boyhood was far advanced. The one solacement of his forlorn existence was the affection which his mother always continued to feel for him.” Chambers' Edinburgh Journal, No. 385.Daft May dies—Andrew Anderson, her ragged and bewildered boy, is forced, by ungracious treatment from an uncle with whom he dwelt, to cast himself upon the world. Fortunately he had obtained some education gratuitously in his native place. With this, his only wealth, “he made his way to Leith, and thence to London, where he was taken into the workshop of a tailor, who, finding that he wrote neatly and had a knowledge of accounts, began, after some time, to employ him as a clerk. He was one day commissioned to take home a suit of clothes to a military gentleman, and to grant a discharge for the account. This gentleman was himself a Scotsman, and bore a commission in a regiment about to proceed to the East Indies. He was, like all Scotsmen at a distance from home, interested in hearing his native tongue spoken, by however humble a person. When, in addition to this, he observed the pleasing countenance and manners of the youth, and found that the discharge appended by him to the account was in a good regular hand, he entered into conversation, asked whence he came, what were his prospects, and other such questions, and finally inquired if he would like to go abroad as a soldier and officer's servant. Anderson required little persuasion to induce him to enter into the stranger's views. He enlisted as a private, and immediately after set sail with the regiment, in the capacity of drummer, acting at the same time, according to previous agreement, as the valet or servant of his patron.” A singularly marked Providence guided the footsteps of “Daft May's loonie,” and, after an absence of sixty years, he returned to the place of his nativity the renowned and wealthy Lieutenant-General Anderson of the East India Company's Service. He “founded and endowed, within the burgh of Elgin, an hospital for the maintenance of indigent men and women not under fifty years of age; also a school of industry for the maintenance and education of male and female children of the labouring classes, whose parents are unable to maintain and educate them, and for putting out the said children, when fit to be so, as apprentices to some trade or occupation, or employing them in such a manner as may enable them to earn a livelihood by their lawful industry, and make them useful members of society.” As o'er her burning brow She laves yon holy spring, And down her cheek of snow The big tear mingling— Would some mild spirit bring The heart-wrung living gem, And place it sparkling In sorrow's diadem! Well might the sallow goddess wear In her cold coronal that tear! The tear of tears is hers, all shed On sireless son's unsheltered head. When misery's guideless gush is o'er, And drowning reason speaks no more; When broken, withered, one by one, All, all earth-bounded wish is gone; When woe is wearied, nor can tell On the scaithed breast another knell; Oh! mother's heart, up-welling there Affection wrestles with despair, And measureless that burning flow, A mother's heart alone may know. “Bairnie, mine, be hush'd to me, An' I'll tell you a dream that I dreamt o' thee, As we lay in the lythe o' yon bare graif-stane— Oh, me! 't was an unco dream yestreen; Yon gruesome spirit that haunts our hame, Wi' ither eldrich goblins came; They pu'd my heart, and they dimm'd my e'e, Till my baby bairn I cou'dna see: But aye I heard your waesome cry, As they bore me o'er yon dreamy sky; And weel, frae the height o' my heavenly ha', On sorrowin' earth my bairn I saw; I saw you conjured—kent your greet, As you crouch'd and cower'd at the carlin's feet; Ilk tear that sped frae your sleepless e'e Were draps like the livin' bleed frae me, Till toil'd, and torn, and wan, and wae, Ye wandered far frae your heather brae; The shrifted souls that dwelt wi' me, Looked wistfu' o'er your destiny; And oh! to me their holy sang In changefu' sweetness swelled alang; And aye their godward melody Breathed watchfu' benisons on thee. I saw the warl' gang rowin by, And you beneath its kindest sky; I marked the hue o' crimson weir, Bedeck the breast o' my bairnie dear; Till the highest head in yon jewelled land, Bent to the beck o' my Andrew's hand. Ae time the warld came rowin' by, We missed ye in yon lo'esome sky, But tracked your keel across the main, To your hameless Highland braes again, And bonnie was the bough and fair Your brave hand brought and planted there! Braid, braid its branch o' fadeless green, Wi' streaks o' sunny light between, As, laughing frae their yellow sky, They kissed the leaves that loot them by. There smiling Plenty safely laid In Mercy's lap her gowden head; The fiercest winter winds that rair, Could never fauld a sna'-wreath there; E'en misery's cauld and witherin' e'e Fell feckless o'er your stately tree. The stricken deer weel there might rest, And lap the bleed frae its dapple breast; The wingless doo would leap and splash A' drippin' frae the hunter's flash, Safe shelter'd in yon shady fa', To croon its little heart awa'; And wee, wee birdies, nane could name, Came flutterin' there, and found a hame; E'en rooks and ravens, tired o' bleed, Sought shelter there in time o' need. But, oh! that wind, its harrying scream Reive through the rest o' my bonnie dream.” OLD FATHER FROST AND HIS FAMILY. “Old Father Frost” was the result of a sportive contest in rhyming between the author and Mr. Adam, whose verses are subjoined, as well for their native prettiness as their giving interest and character to the whole. Old Father Frost hath children twain, Begotten 'twixt him and his Lady rain: Though he is harsh, yet mild is she, And this is seen in their family. Old Father Frost and his family! Yes, Father Frost is a hard old churl, On his upper lip there's a bitter curl; And his black ill-favoured visage throws A sombre shade o'er his pale blue nose. Old Father Frost and his family! When the summer heat hath passed away, And gentle Rain gives up her sway, Old Father Frost, with his iron hand, Seizes and binds each northern land. Old Father Frost and his family! And hard it were for the creatures of earth, Were it not that Lady Rain gives birth To her chaste and kindly daughter, Snow, Who throws her mantle o'er all below. Old Father Frost and his family! For stern is the fiat of Father Frost, He chains the waters though tempest-toss't; And he freezes up the very ground Till it yields a ringing metal sound. Old Father Frost and his family! But like the Paynim maid in the minstrel tale, Who released the knight from her father's jail, Sweet sister Snow sets prisoners free, And mitigates Frost's severity. Old Father Frost and his family! Not so kind by half is brother Hail, Who rattles about in his coat of mail, And bends and shatters both shrub and flower, In the wanton display of his father's power. Old Father Frost and his family! But Frost, and Rain, and Hail, and Snow, Come at your time when you come below; And we'll welcome you all with a cheerful smile, And drink and laugh and sing the while. Old Father Frost and his family! Grim father Frost, he had children twain, The cloud-born daughters of Lady Rain; The elder, a coquettish pattering thing, Would woo you in winter, and pelt you in spring; At times you might scarce feel her feathery fall, Anon she will beard you with icicle ball; When the warrings of heaven roll higher and higher, She, coward-like, flees from the conflict of fire— Yet heightens the havoc, for her feeble power, Tho' scaithless the oak, how it fells the frail flower! And the bud of the berry, the bloom of the bean, Are founder'd to earth by the merciless quean; E'en the stout stems of summer full often must quail To this rattling, brattling, head-breaking hail. I'll not say a word of how rudely she breaks On the dream of the garret-doomed maid, and awakes A thousand regrets in the marrowless lass, And cruelly mimics the “touch on the glass,” With her cold little pearls, that dance, bound, and play, Like our ain bonnie bairns on Candlemas day. You know her meek sister? Oh, soft is the fall Of her fairy footsteps on hut and on hall! To hide the old father's bleak doings below, In pity she cometh, the minist'ring snow. With her mantle she covers the shelterless trees, As they groan to the howl of the Borean breeze; And baffles the search of the subtle wind, Guarding each crevice lest it should find Its moaning way to the fireless fold Of the trembling young and the weeping old. When through her white bosom the daisy appears, She greets the fair stranger with motherly tears! And they mingle so sweet with the golden ray Of the struggling beam that chides her away. But where's the last speck of her brightness seen, Mid the bursting spring and its saucy green? In the coldest side of yon lone churchyard, Neglected graves she loveth to ward; But not where gorgeous marble pleads, And frequent foot of mourner treads; But down by the stranger's noteless lair, Where sighs are few and footsteps rare, She loveth, she loveth to linger there! O'er hearts forgotten that sleep below, There is none to weep but the friendly snow. AUTUMN WINDS. Air—“Bonnie House o' Airly.” Oh, ye waesome winds, hoo your mourning grieves, Hoo your sighing an' moaning fear me! As ye toss an' tear the trembling leaves That ye cherished when he was near me. I've kent ye woo them—I've heard ye woo, As saftly as woman's lane sighing; When ye slyly kissed the cozie dew Frae their faulded bosoms lying. Now nightly athwart the naked plain, Ye are whirling the saucy snaw in; Ye've changed the dew to the pelting rain, Till your poor droukit leaves are fa'in. Hae ye fausely strayed 'mang misty groves, Wi' ice-wreathed maidens to marrow? Oh, they've come an' slain your bonnie summer loves, An' driven ye daft wi' sorrow! But my love is true, ye winds that blaw, And your fauseness maunna fear me; His kind heart never will flit nor fa', Nor own anither dearie. There's ae green branch on yon blighted tree, An' the lave a' darkly dwining; There's ae bricht e'e looks love to me, Like the weird licht o'er me shining. Yet oh, ye winds, hoo your wailing grieves! Hoo your sighing an' moaning fear me! As ye toss an' tear the dowie grey leaves That waur green, green, when he was near me. OH, MARY! WHEN YOU THINK OF ME. [For a period of seventeen years I was employed in a great weaving factory in Aberdeen. It contained upwards of three hundred looms, worked by as many male and female weavers. 'Twas a sad place, indeed, and many a curiosity sort of man and woman entered that blue gate. Amongst the rest, that little, sly fellow Cupid would steal past “Willie the porter” (who never dreamed of such a being)—steal in amongst us, and make a very harvest of it. Upon the remembrance of one of his rather graver doings the song of “Mary” is composed. One of our shopmates, a virtuous young woman, fairly, though unconsciously, carried away the whole bulk and value of a poor weaver's heart. He became restless and miserable, but could never muster spirit to speak his flame. “He never told his love”—yes, he told it to me. At his request, I told it to Mary, and she laughed. Five weeks passed away, and I saw him to the churchyard. For many days ere he died, Mary watched by his bedside, a sorrowful woman, indeed. Never did widow's tears fall more burningly. It is twenty years since then. She is now a wife and a mother; but the remembrance of that, their last meeting, still haunts her sensitive nature, as if she had done a deed of blood.] Oh, Mary! when you think of me, Let pity hae its share, love; Tho' others mock my misery, Do you in mercy spare, love My heart, oh, Mary! own'd but thee, And sought for thine so fervently; The saddest tear e'er wet my e'e, Ye ken wha brocht it there, love. Oh, lookna wi' that witching look, That wiled my peace awa', love! An' dinna let me hear you sigh, It tears my heart in twa, love! Resume the frown ye wont to wear, Nor shed the unavailing tear, The hour of doom is drawing near, An' welcome be its ca', love! How could ye hide a thought sae kind, Beneath sae cauld a brow, love? The broken heart it winna bind Wi' gowden bandage now, love. No, Mary! mark yon reckless shower! It hung aloof in scorching hour, An' helps nae now the feckless flower That sinks beneath its flow, love. I'VE SOUGHT IN LANDS AYONT THE SEA. Written at Stocks, near Tring, 1841.

Come o'er the waters, dinna fear, The lav'rock lilts as lo'esome here, An' mony a sweet, around, above, Shall welcome o'er my Jessie, love. My hame wi' halesome gear is fu', My heart wi' loweing love for you; Oh, haste, my Jessie, come an' see The hame—the heart that waits for thee: But mind ye, lass, the fleetfu' hours, They wait nae—spare nae fouk nor flowers, An' sair are fouk and flowers to blame, Wha wishfu', wastefu' wait for them. Oh, bide nae lang in swither, then, Since flowers an' fouk may wither, then; But come, as lang's I hae to gie A hame—a heart to welcome thee! I WOULDNA—OH!

I couldna look On that sweet face again; I daurna trust my simple heart, Now it's ance mair my ain. I wouldna thole what I hae thol'd Sic dule I wouldna dree, For a' that love could now unfold Frae woman's witchfu' e'e. I've mourn'd until the waesome moon Has sunk ahint the hill, An' seen ilk sparkling licht aboon Creep o'er me, mournin' still. I've thocht my very mither's hame Was hameless-like to me; Nor could I think this warld the same That I was wont to see. But years o' mingled care hae past, Wi' blinks o' joy between; An' yon heart-hoarded form at last Forsakes my doited een. Sae cauld and dark my bosom now, Sic hopes lie buried there! That sepulchre whaur love's saft lowe May never kindle mair. I couldna trust this foolish heart When it's ance mair my ain; I couldna—oh! I daurna look On Mary's face again! JEANIE'S GRAVE. I saw my true Love first on the banks of queenly Tay, Nor did I deem it yielding my trembling heart away; I feasted on her deep dark eye, and loved it more and more, For, oh! I thought I ne'er had seen a look so kind before! I heard my true Love sing, and she taught me many a strain, But a voice so sweet, oh! never shall my cold ear hear again, In all our friendless wanderings, in homeless penury, Her gentle song and jetty eye were all unchanged to me. I saw my true Love fade—I heard her latest sigh— I wept no frivolous weeping when I closed her lightless eye; Far from her native Tay she sleeps, and other waters lave The markless spot where Ury creeps around my Jeanie's grave. Move noiseless, gentle Ury! around my Jeanie's bed, And I'll love thee, gentle Ury! where'er my footsteps tread; For sooner shall thy fairy wave return from yonder sea, Than I forget yon lowly grave, and all it hides from me. Three mountain streamlets brawl separately down their break-neck journey, and tumble in peace together at the woods at Newton, near Old Rayne. This quiet confluence is the Ury. Like worn-out racers, these boisterous burns take breath, gliding along in harmonious languor some three or four miles, when the peaceful Ury is, as it were, cut through by the Gadie, a desperately crabbed-looking rivulet, raging and rumbling from Benachie. From this last annoyance, Ury moves onward in noiseless sweetness, winding and winding, as if aware of its own brief course, and all unwilling to leave the braes that hap the heroes of Harlaw. By-and-by, it creeps mournfully past the sequestered graveyard of Inverury, kisses the “Bass,” and is swallowed up in the blue waters of the Don; its whole extent being only ten miles. Close by the graveyard stands the Bass of Inverury—a conical-shaped hill, thickly studded with trees. The gloomy legends told of its origin and subsequent uses, would make one readily own its fitting neighbourhood to a place of skulls. One will tell you that, once upon a time, the plague came upon Scotland, and Inverury had its share; that a deserted house stood then on the banks of the Ury—thither was carried the infected till the number of patients outran the skill and resources of their friends, who assembled to deliberate on “ways and means.” It was then settled upon, that, to shorten present suffering, and to secure future safety, the best way was to bury them forthwith, house and all. It was done then. Hence the “Bass.”“Some maintain that the Bass has been used for judicial purposes. By others it is supposed to be of a sepulchral character, and to contain the remains of Eth or Aoth, a Pictish king, who was killed a year after his accession in A.D. 88I. The old rhyme of Thomas the Rhymer, ‘When Dee and Don shall run in one, And Tweed shall run in Tay, The bonnie water of Ury Shall bear the Bass away,’ is in every one's mouth in this district.” At Newton are some remarkable lofty stones (monoliths). The Antiquarian Society have had casts made of the inscriptions and figures on them, but they have hitherto defied the attempts of the learned to decipher them. THEY SPEAK O' WYLES. Air—“Gin a bodie meet a bodie.” They speak o' wyles in woman's smiles, An' ruin in her e'e— I ken they bring a pang at whiles That's unco sair to dree; But mind ye this, the half-taen kiss, The first fond fa'in' tear, Is, Heaven kens, fu' sweet amends An' tints o' heaven here. When twa leal hearts in fondness meet, Life's tempests howl in vain— The very tears o' love are sweet, When paid with tears again. Shall sapless prudence shake its pow, Shall cauldrife caution fear? Oh, dinna, dinna droun the lowe That lichts a heaven here! What tho' we're ca'd a wee before The stale “three score an' ten;” When “Joy” keeks kindly at your door, Aye bid her welcome ben. About yon blissfu' bowers above Let doubtfu' mortals speir, Sae weel ken we that “Heaven is love” Since love makes heaven here. THE LAST TRYST. This nicht ye'll cross the bosky glen, Ance mair, oh, would ye meet me then? I'll seem as bygane bliss an' pain Were a' forgot. I winna weep to weary thee, Nor seek the love ye canna gie;— Whaur first we met, oh, let that be The parting spot! The hour jist when the faithless licht O' yon pale star forsakes the nicht; I wouldna pain ye wi' the blicht Ye've brought to me. Nor would I that yon proud cauld ray Should mock me wi' its scornfu' play;— The sunken een and tresses gray Ye maunna see. Wi' sindered hearts few words will sair, An' brain-dried grief nae tears can spare; These bluidless lips shall never mair Name thine or thee. At murky nicht, oh, meet me then! Restore my plighted troth again; Your bonnie bride shall never ken Your wrangs to me. ONE OF THE HEART'S STRUGGLES. Air—“Willie was a wanton wag.” “Oh! let me gang, ye dinna ken How sair my mither flate yestreen— An', mournin' o'er and o'er again, Speir'd whaur I gaed sae late at e'en. An' aye I saw her dicht her een— My very heart maist brak to see 't— I'd byde a flyte though e'er sae keen, But canna, canna thole her greet.” “Oh! blessin's guard my lassie's brow, And fend her couthie heart frae care; Her lowein' breast o' love sae fu'— How can I grudge a mither's share? The hinnysuckle's no sae fair, In gloamin's dewy pearl weet, As my love's e'e when tremblin' there The tear that owns a mither's greet. “A heart a' warmed to mither's love— Oh! that's the heart whaur I wad be; An' when a mither's lips reprove, Oh! gie me then the glist'nin' e'e. For feckless fa's that look on me, Howe'er sae feigned in cunnin's sweet— And loveless—luckless—is the e'e That, tearless, kens a mither greet.” YE DINNA KEN YON BOWER. Air—“Jenny Nettles.” Ye dinna ken yon bower, Frae the glow'rin warl' hidden, Ye maunna ken yon bower Bonnie in the gloamin'. Nae woodbine sheds a fragrance there, Nae rose, nae daffodillie fair; But, oh! yon flow'r beyond compare That blossoms in the gloamin'. There's little licht in yon bower, Day and darkness elbow ither, That's the licht in yon bower, Bonnie in the gloamin'. Awa' ye sun, wi' lavish licht, And bid brown Benachie guid nicht; To me a star mair dearly bricht Aye glimmers in the gloamin'. There's nae a sound in yon bower Merl's sough nor mavis singin'; Whispers saft in yon bower, Mingle in the gloamin'. What though drowsie lav'rocks rest, Cow'rin' in their sangless nest? When, oh! the voice that I like best Cheers me in the gloamin'. There's artless truth in yon bower, Sweeter than the scented blossom; Bindin' hearts in yon bower, Glowin' in the gloamin'. The freshness o' the upland lea, The fragrance o' the blossom'd pea, A' mingle in her breath to me, Sichin' in the gloamin'. CONCLUDING CHORUS. Then haud awa' frae yon bower, Cauldrife breast or loveless bosom; True love dwells in yon bower, Gladdest in the gloamin'. BONNIE MAY. NOTE TO A FRIEND, WITH THE ACCOMPANYING VERSES. The muse made a short and surly “drop in” yesterday morning,—quite unsexed as to apparel—great-coat buttoned over Taglioni, superinvolved by a Kilmarnock cravat. Several apologies for absence of late, bad cold, &amp;c., &amp;c. Asked, with rueful solemnity, whether I had heard anything of May. Hinted at certain scandals current in the “twelve signs,” bearing unfavourably on the repute of our darling month. In short, that she had made off and away with that bloodless old fool, January. Poor thing; how she wailed—her May, her May! Well, I picked up so many tears from a fold of the Kilmarnock, strung them on so many sighs, and here they are to the tune of “The year that's awa'.” Air—“The year that's awa.” Oh, whar hae ye gane, bonnie May, Hae ye left us for ever an' aye? Your daft brither, June, brak in wi' a stoun', Maist frichtit our birdies away, Oh, May! An' faint a bit liltie hae they. Our gowans droop wither'd an' grey, Our bairnies creep sullen an' blae; Through blifferts o' caul' they yaumer an' yaul, An' want ye to warm them, May, Oh, May! Our dear, duddie bairnies, May. The whir o' the witherin' wind Drives madly o'er burn an' brae; The tremblin' breird fa's sadden an' sear'd, An' kens nae the nicht frae the day, Oh, May! An' hae ye forsaken us, May? Our crafters look crabbit an' fey, Our wee bits o' bushes decay; They crouch in the yard, cauld blabs on ilk beard, An' greet to the mornin' grey, Oh, May! They miss the lythe licht o' their May. I've nae mair to sing or to say, But come, gin you're comin', sweet May, Ere Martinmas drear set the Factor asteer, An' then there's the deevil to pay, Oh, May! Our stools an' our tubbies away! LINES WRITTEN AT RAVENSCRAIG, A RUIN ON THE BANKS OF UGIE, NEAR PETERHEAD, ABERDEENSHIRE. “A building—such a one As age to age might add for uses vile, A windowless, deformed, and dreary pile.” Shelley. Yon's Ravenscraig, wi' riven ha', A thousand winters shook its wa'— Tired Time let scythe an' san'glass fa', To breathe awhile at Ugie. For here, by brake, by burn an' lea, Fair Nature freaks sae changefullie! Now lauchin' daft, syne greets to see Yon grim, grey towers at Ugie. An' wha can mark yon dungeon dour, Unmindfu' o' the waesome hour, When man o'er man, wi' fiendish power, Made sick the trembling Ugie. Bring ivy wi' its peaceful green, Gae hide ilk hoar, unhallow'd stane; They maunna bloat yon bonnie een That watch the gushin' Ugie.

Inverury, March 1st, 1844. SIR,—In your paper, the other week, I read of a woman, Cameron, Overgate, Dundee, found dead—her child, a boy of seven years, sleeping beside her. She expired unknown to any—she and her little son lying on a shakedown in a wretched hovel—not a morsel of food, but every mark of starvation, cold and hunger. Now, sir, having myself tasted the bitter cup—having seen death at work in this same hideous form—the above tragedy affected me very much. I do not think ill of mankind, but the contrary. I would not reflect on the goodwill of those who undertake, and whose duty it then is, to watch the abodes of misery. Reproach may not apply to the will of parties so placed; but what could the mildest say of that blameable and fatal ignorance that thus defeats the very best ends of mercy—leaving a human creature to struggle with death in its most revolting attitude—then mock the whole with a sort of posthumous wail? I sincerely believe that there was not one in Dundee that night—whether on hardest pallet or softest down—but would have started in the dark hour, ministered to yon perishing woman, soothed the little trembler at her cold breast, and been happy. But who knew of it? Why, everybody, next day, when the white coffin In Dundee, it lately was the case, if not still, that paupers' coffins were not allowed to be blackened. is seen borne along by a troop of pale-faced existences, whose present suffering is nowise smoothed by the prospect offered in their then dowie occupation, and the fate that may be their own one cold dark night ere long. Starvation to death is not uncommon amongst us; yet we are in the nineteenth century—the pearl age of benevolent societies, charity-schools, and “useful knowledge.” Would benevolence be perverted, charity made colder, or the knowledge useless, that made us timeously acquainted with catastrophes like these? In Aberdeen, the other week, an aged man was found dead in his garret, with every appearance of want and wretchedness. How came it to be known? Did the elder of the district discover it while on his round of Christian inquiry? Did some benevolent ruler in a benevolent society miss his poor old neighbour? Weeks and weeks his tottering footsteps had not been seen on the pavement, or heard in his naked abode. He is dead—starved dead—and the stench of his half-consumed body first gives notices that, “however man may act by man, Death is at his post.” Oh, that some kind-hearted creature, with a turn for statistical computation, would lend me a hand! It might be made clear, I think, that in a population of sixty thousand, one hundred could be spared (by regular changes) to hunt Misery to its very heels, and scare it, at least, from its more hideous feasts. Say that districts are divided into wards, each ward having its appointed inspector, whose duty it should be to observe earnestly, and report faithfully, all concerning the povery-stricken residents in his charge. That the “Murder of Neglect” is perpetrated in this land is one terrible fact, and it is as true, though, alas! not so terrifying, that he who is ignorant of it, or, knowing it, feels it only as an incident per course, bestowing upon it a fushionless shrug, and a “woe's me,”—that man has blood upon his head! We are the children of one Father, travelling together on the broad and brief way to eternity. Alas! for such unequal equipment—seeing we must at last pull up at the one same stage! You will forgive me all this preaching, but my soul is in it, and last night I composed the following lines bearing that way. If you think these, or any sentiments here expressed, would, if made public, in any way move an additional feeling in favour of the “Overgate Orphan,” I would be proud and happy. 'Tis the lone wail of woman, a mother's last woe, And tearless the eye when the soul weepeth so— Nor fuel nor food in yon widowless lair, The sleeping is watched by the dying one there. “Oh, wauken nae, wauken nae, my dowie dear! My dead look would wither your wee heart wi' fear; Sleep on till yon cauld moon is set in the sea, Gin mornin', hoo cauld will your wauk'nin' be! “Ye creep to a breast, Jamie, cauld as the snaw, Ye hang roun' a heart, Jamie, sinkin' awa'; I'm laith, laith to leave ye, though fain would I dee Gin Heaven would lat my lost laddie wi' me!” Awaken, lone trembler, the moon has no light, And the grey glint of morning drives back the fell night; Her last look is fixing in yon frozen tear— Awaken, lone trembler, thy home is not here! The death-grasp awoke him—the struggle is o'er, He moans to the ear that will listen no more: “You're caulder than me, mither, cauld though I be, And that look is nae like your ain look to me. “I dreamt how my father came back frae the deid, An' waesome an' eerie the looks that he gied; He wyled ye awa' till ye sindered frae me— Oh, hap me, my mither, I'm cauld—like to dee!” The creaking white coffin is hurried away, The mourners all motley, and shrivelled and gray; Each meagre one muttering it over yon bier— “So colder my home is—oh, God! it were here!” YTHANSIDE. I had ae nicht, and only ane, On flow'ry Ythanside, An' kith or kindred I hae nane That dwall by Ythanside; Yet midnicht dream and morning vow At hame they winna bide, But pu', and pu' my willing heart Awa' to Ythanside. What gars ilk restless, wand'ring wish Seek aye to Ythanside, An' hover round yon fairy bush That spreads o'er Ythanside? I think I see its pawkie boughs, Whaur lovers weel might hide; An' oh! what heart could safely sit Yon nicht at Ythanside? Could I return and own the scaith I thole frae Ythanside, Would her mild e'e bend lythe on me Ance mair on Ythanside? Or, would she crush my lowly love Beneath a brow o' pride? I daurna claim, and maunna blame, Her heart on Ythanside. I'll rue yon high and heathy seat In the woods of Essilmont, there is a most romantic looking pinnacle overhanging the water Ythan. Nature has scooped in it a beautiful little gallery. There the late Miss Gordon, of Essilmont (an old castle, the seat of the Cheynes of Essilmont, was daily soon surrounded by the children of the neighbouring peasantry, teaching them all things needful to their situation in life—their duty to God and the world. Ythan rises in Forgue, out of Fondland Hill, from two springs; is about 15 miles long, without reckoning its windings; and has six ferry boats; is deep and black, and hence dangerous, Yet it abounds with pearls, which, were they waited for till they became ripe, would turn to good account. Hence one of our poets (Hawthornden, in an epitaph on a nobleman buried here), addressing himself to his river in a melancholy strain, hath said— “Ythan ! thy pearly coronet let fall.” The top-pearl in the crown of Scotland, is reported to have been found in Kelly, a little brook that falls into Ythan in Methlick parish. Sir Thomas Menzies of Cults having procured it—for beauty and bigness, the best at any time found in Scotland, —and having found, by the judgement of the best jewellers in Edinburgh, that it was most precious, and of a very high value, went up to London and gifted it to the king, —this was in the year 1620,—who, in retribution, gave him 12 or 14 chalders of victual about Dumferline, and the custom of merchant-goods in Aberdeen during his life. In the reign of King Charles I., the trade was considered of sufficient moment to be worthy the attention of the Parliament. The pearls of Scotland long shared with those of Bohemia the reputation of being the best found in Europe, though they were held to be very far inferior to those found in the East. —[Description of the Diocese of Aberdeen, and notes to it; presented to the Spalding Club by the Earl of Aberdeen.] That hangs o'er Ythanside; I'll rue the mill whaur burnies meet; I'll rue ye, Ythanside. An' you, ye Moon, wi' luckless licht, Pour'd a' your gowden tide O'er sic a brow!—sic een, yon nicht!— Oh, weary Ythanside! A CHIEFTAIN UNKNOWN TO THE QUEEN. 1843. Auld Scotland cried “Welcome your Queen!” Ilk glen echoed “Welcome your Queen!” While turret and tower to mountain and moor, Cried “Wauken and welcome our Queen!” Syne, oh! sic deray was exprest, As Scotland for lang hadna seen; When bodies cam bickerin' a' clad in their best— To beck to their bonnie young Queen. When a' kinds o' colours cam south, An' scarlet Scarlet is the town's livery. frae sly Aberdeen: Ilk flutterin' heart flitted up to the mouth, A' pantin' to peep at our Queen. There were Earls on that glittering strand, Wi' diamond Dame mony ane; An' weel might it seem that the happiest land Was trod by the happiest Queen. Then mony a chieftain's heart Beat high 'neath its proud tartan screen; But one sullen chief stood afar and apart, Nor wrecked he the smile o' a Queen. “Wha's he winna blink on our Queen, Wi' his haffets sae lyart and lean?” O ho! it is Want, wi' his gathering gaunt, An' his million of mourners unseen. Proud Scotland cried “Hide them; oh, hide! The Paisley weavers formed a portion in the retinue of this sulky chief. At the very time Scotland, with its best foot foremost, was prancing before its beloved Sovereign, the street orange-sellers of Edinburgh were ordered “to bed” till the Queen left, by the same sage authorities that were snoring when the Queen came. So—so—behind the fairest painting you will find mere canvas— aye, canvas! An' lat nae them licht on her een; Wi' their bairnies bare, it would sorrow her sair; For a mither's heart moves in our Queen.” THE DRUNKARD'S DREAM. “Who hath woe? Who hath sorrows? They that tarry long at the wine.” Proverbs xxiii, 29, 30. Oh, tempt me not to the drunkard's draught, With its soul-consuming gleam! Oh, hide me from the woes that waft Around the drunkard's dream! When night in holy silence brings The God-willed hour of sleep, Then, then the red-eyed revel swings Its bowl of poison deep! When morning waves its golden hair, And smiles o'er hill and lea, One sick'ning ray is doomed to glare On yon rude revelry! The rocket's flary moment sped, Sinks black'ning back to earth; Yet darker—deeper sinks his head Who shares the drunkard's mirth! Know ye the sleep the drunkard knows? That sleep, oh, who may tell? Or who can speak the fiendful throes Of his self-heated hell? The soul all reft of heav'nly mark— Defaced God's image there— Rolls down and down yon abyss dark, Thy howling home, Despair! Or bedded his head on broken hearts, Where slimy reptiles creep; And the ball-less eye of Death still darts Black fire on the drunkard's sleep! And lo! their coffin'd bosoms rife, That bled in his ruin wild! The cold, cold lips of his shrouded wife, Press lips of his shrouded child! So fast—so deep the hold they kept! Hark! that unhallow'd scream; Guard us, oh God! from the drunkard's sleep— From the drunkard's demon-dream! CAN YE FORGET? “My sight Is dim to see that charactered in vain On this unfeeling leaf, which burns the brain And eats into it, blotting all things fair And wise and good, which time had written there.” Shelley. Can ye forget yon sunny day Whan sparkling Ury murmured by? Whaur birdies in their blythest way Poured April sangs athwart the sky? How little, little then kent I Sae fause the lip that prest to mine; Oh! wha could think yon fever'd sigh Cam frae a breast sae cauld as thine? But weel mind I as o'er my head A wee, wee lanesome birdie sang; Sae waesome did its music plead, I scarce could hide the tear it brang. My heart maist frae my bosom sprang, Syne trembling sank wi' bodefu' knell, For, oh! I feared that I ere lang Micht maen in siclike lonely wail. Sinsyne I've kent cauld gloamin' come, Whan blae and wae the Ury ran; Whan cow'rin' birds a' nestled dumb, An' cheerless nicht lower'd o'er the lawn. Sic time my bursting bosom faun' The slack'ning gush that nane micht see; And aye the licht's unlo'esome dawn Brang life an' love to a' but me! I had nae hinnied words to woo, Nae gainfu' gifts had I to spare; But, oh! I had a heart sae true, That nocht could shift, that nane should share. Ae trembling wish alane lived there— Ae hope that held the witless way; That hope is gane, an' evermair Left darkness owre life's dowie day. THE LASS O' KINTORE. Air—“Oh, as I was kiss'd yestreen!” At hame or afield I am cheerless an' lone, I'm dull on the Ury and droop by the Don; Their murmur is noisy an' fashious to hear, An' the lay o' the lintie fa's deid on my ear. I hide frae the moon, and whaur naebody sees, I greet to the burnie an' sich to the breeze; Tho' I sich till I'm silly, an' greet till I dee, Kintore is the spot in this world for me. But the lass o' Kintore, oh, the lass o' Kintore! Be warned awa' frae the lass o' Kintore; There's a love-luring look that I ne'er kent afore, Steals cannily hame to the heart at Kintore. They bid me forget her—oh! how can it be? In kindness or scorn she's ever wi' me; I feel her fell frown in the lift's frosty blue, An' I weel ken her smile in the lily's saft hue. I try to forget her, but canna forget— I 've liket her lang, an' I aye like her yet; My poor heart may wither—may waste to its core, But forget her? oh, never! the lass o' Kintore! Oh, the woods o' Kintore! the holmes o' Kintore! The love-lichtin' e'e that I ken at Kintore; I'll wander afar, an' I'll never look more On the dark glance o' Peggy or bonnie Kintore! DID THEY MEET AGAIN? Awa' ye weary licht, Nae moon nor starnie bricht; Oh! for thy midwatch nicht An' rayless hour; Whan I may gang alane, Unmarked by mortal een, An' meet my bosom queen In her murky bower. I ken she's waitin' there— She's faithfu' as she's fair— I'll twine her raven hair Roun' her snawie brow; An' vow by earth an' sea, Hoo dear she's been to me, An' thou lone Benachie Maun hear that vow. We loved—alas!—sae leal! But this sad nicht maun seal The lang—the last fareweel 'Tween her an'me. Whaure'er my fate may guide, Or weel or wae betide, I'll mind wha dwalls beside Dark Benachie. WHAUR DOES THE BLYTHE BEE SIP? Whaur does the blythe bee sip Whan it laves in the lo'esome honey? It may lave itsel' In the bricht blue bell, But I ken a lip Whaur nane daur sip— Whaur sweets are true as monie. There are wyles in yon peerless mou' Whan her sang in the heart rings bonnie, An' I daurna think O' the witchfu' blink Frae an e'e as blest As the draps that rest On the gowan's breast sae cannie. I may sigh whan my heart is sair, I may rue unkent to onie; But, oh come again Wi' yer 'wilderin' strain An' the balmy lip Whaur angels wad sip Whan sarv'd o' their heaven's honey! LINES ADDRESSED TO MISS MARY FORBES ROBERTSON ON HER LEAVING FOR SCOTLAND AFTER A VISIT TO FRIENDS IN LONDON, NOV., 1846. We could wish you still among us, For we loved you as our own; You were more and more beloved As you more and more were known. But artless thou, and young, Mary, Unmeet for crime and care— In thy home of sweet simplicity We bless thee, Mary, there! Were worldly wealth thy lot, Mary, They'd woo for that alone— The more thou lovely art, Mary, All earlier thou undone. Here wit, and wealth, and loveliness Are but a triple snare; A sweeter, safer home is thine, We bless thee, Mary, there! Ye hear not now the 'wildering sounds That fill the sickened ear; But, oh, ye ken a hundred hills A hundred times mair dear! There's lytheness in our Hieland howes, Where heart with heart can share; Oh dinna mourn, Mary lass, Sic blessings wait you there! THE LASS WI' THE WANDERIN' E'E. “Oh! wha that sang yon sang to me, That I can ne'er forget? What is't that aucht yon lo'esome e'e? Sae weel's I see it yet! An' cam she frae the far, far east, The lass wi' the wanderin' e'e; The heart lay tremblin' in my breast To the sang she sung to me! “Haud doun sic hope ye fond, fond man, For loveless is her strain; She feasts on hearts aroun' her fa'in, Yet scaithless keeps her ain. She laughs to ken the bleed-drap fa', An' gladdens at ilka woun'; Oh, turn your wishfu' heart awa', There's wae in yon sweet soun'! “I maunna mind what may betide— Oh! send that maid to me, An' place her near this beating side, Sae like to gar me dee; For I would feast on her fair look An' lavish on her sang;— Her dark e'e is a holy book In whilk I read nae wrang.” MY HEATHER LAND. Air—“The Highland Watch.” My heather land, my heather land! My dearest pray'r be thine; Altho' upon thy hapless heath, There breathes nae friend o' mine. The lanely few that Heaven has spar'd Fend on a foreign strand; And I maun wait to weep wi' thee, My hameless heather land! My heather land, my heather land! Though fairer lands there be, Thy gow'nie braes in early days, Were gowden ways to me. Maun life's poor boon gae dark'ning doun, Nor die whaur it had dawn'd, But claught a grave ayont the wave? Alas! my heather land! My heather land, my heather land! Though chilling Winter pours His freezing breath roun' fireless hearth, Whaur breadless misery cow'rs; Yet breaks the light that soon shall blight The godless reivin' hand— Whan wither'd tyranny shall reel Frae our rous'd heather land! MY HAMELESS HA'. Oh! how can I be cheerie in this hameless ha'? The very sun glints eerie on the gilded wa'; An' aye the nicht sae drearie, Ere the dowie morn daw, Whan I canna win to see you My Jamie ava. Tho' monie miles between us, an' far, far frae me, The bush that wont to screen us frae the cauld warl's e'e, Its leaves may waste and wither, But its branches winna fa'; An' hearts may haud thegither, Tho' frien's drap awa'. Ye promis'd to speak o' me to the lanesome moon, An' weird kind wishes to me, in the lark's saft soun'; I doat upon that moon, Till my very heart fills fu'; An' aye yon birdie's tune Gars me greet for you. Then how can I be cheerie in the stranger's ha'? A gowden prison drearie, my luckless fa'! 'Tween leavin' o' you Jamie, An' ills that sorrow me, I'm wearie o' the warl' An' carena though I dee. TO MY SON WILLIE The ae dark spot in this loveless world, That spot maun ever be, Willie, Whaur she sat an' dauted your bonnie brown hair, An' lithely looket to me, Willie; An' oh! my heart owned a' the power Of your mither's gifted e'e, Willie. There's now nae blink at our slacken'd hearth, Nor kindred breathing there, Willie; But cauld and still our hame of Death, Wi' its darkness evermair, Willie; For she wha lived in our love, is cauld, An' her grave the stranger's lair, Willie. The sleepless nicht, the dowie dawn, A' stormy though it be, Willie, Ye'll buckle ye in your weet wee plaid, An' wander awa wi' me, Willie; Your lanesome sister little kens, Sic tidings we hae to gie, Willie. The promised day, the trysted hour, She'll strain her watchfu' e'e, Willie; Seeking that mither's look of love, She never again maun see, Willie; Kiss ye the tear frae her whitening cheek, An' speak awhile for me, Willie. Look kindly, kindly when ye meet, But speak nae of the dead, Willie; An' when your heart would gar you greet, Aye turn awa' your head, Willie; That waesome look ye look to me Would gar her young heart bleed, Willie. Whane'er she names a mither's name, An' sairly presseth thee, Willie, Oh! tell her of a happy hame Far, far o'er earth an' sea, Willie; An' ane that waits to welcome them, Her hameless bairns, an' me, Willie. TO MY SON WILLIE IN THE INFIRMARY “I shall just mention another incident, though, in point of order, it should have been told before. After many months of hopeless wanderings, my family and I at length found a settled home at Inverury. Comparative rest and warmth succeeding to watchful misery, we were, one and all, afflicted with dishealth. Willie, especially, suffered long, and at last had to be conveyed to the Aberdeen infirmary. There he had to undergo a serious operation. I knew his timid nature, and went thither to sustain and comfort him through that severe trial. The operation took place a day earlier than that mentioned to me, so it was over ere I arrived. I found him asleep in his little chamber, and the feelings of that moment are partially embodied in the following lines:—” “Hospital charities for devastated homes! Faugh! Give me my wages; have I not laboured?” Wake ye, sleep ye, my hapless boy, In this homeless house of care? Lack ye the warmth of a mother's eye On thy cauldrife lonely lair? Dost thou clasp in thy dream a brother's hand, Yet waken thee all alone? Thy deep dark eye, does it open unblest? Nor father?—nor sister? None! Thy father's board is too narrow, my child, For ills like thine to be there; The comfortless hearth of thy parent is cold, And his light but the light of despair. Has God disown'd them, the children of toil? Is the promise of Heaven no more? Shall Industry weep?—shall the pamper'd suppress The sweat-earned bread of the poor? Alas! and the wind as it blew and blew On the famished and houseless then, Has blighted the bud of my heart's best hope, And it never may blossom again. 'Twas so. In my very, very heart, I found it. Who are they that beat about in the substanceless regions of fancy for material to move a tear? Who but the silken bandaged sons of comfort?—ink-bleeders whose sorrows are stereotyped—they who see life only through the hazy medium of theory, and do at farthest obtain but a mellow blink of those sickening realities that settle around the poor man's hearth. DREAMINGS OF THE BEREAVED. The morning breaks bonnie o'er mountain an' stream, An' troubles the hallowed breath o' my dream! The gowd light of morning is sweet to the e'e, But, ghost-gathering midnight, thou'rt dearer to me. The dull common world then sinks from my sight, An' fairer creations arise to the night; When drowsy oppression has sleep-sealed my e'e, Then bright are the visions awaken'd to me! Oh! come, spirit mother, discourse of the hours, My young bosom beat all its beating to yours, When heart-woven wishes in soft counsel fell, On ears—how unheedful prov'd sorrow might tell! That deathless affection—nae trial could break, When a' else forsook me ye wouldna forsake, Then come, oh! my mother, come often to me, An' soon an' for ever I'll come unto thee! An' thou shrouded loveliness! soul-winning Jean, How cold was thy hand on my bosom yestreen! 'Twas kind—for the lowe that your e'e kindled there, Will burn aye, an' burn, till that breast beat nae mair, Our bairnies sleep round me, oh! bless ye their sleep, Your ain dark-e'ed Willie will wauken an' weep; But blythe in his weepin' he'll tell me how you, His heaven-hamed mammie, was “dautin' his brow.” Tho' dark be our dwallin'—our happin' tho' bare, An' night closes round us in cauldness an' care; Affection will warn us—an' bright are the beams That halo our hame in yon dear land of dreams. Then weel may I welcome the night's deathy reign, Wi' souls of the dearest I mingle me then, The gowd light of morning is lightless to me, But, oh, for the night wi' its ghost revelrie! THE MITHERLESS BAIRN. When a' ither bairnies are hushed to their hame, By aunty, or cousin, or frecky grand-dame; Wha stan's last an' lanely, an' naebody carin'? 'Tis the puir doited loonie—the mitherless bairn! The mitherless bairn gangs till his lane bed, Nane covers his cauld back, or haps his bare head; His wee In hardy Scotland, it is not always a sure sign of poverty in its sons and daughters that they are to be seen tripping it bare-footed from April till Christmas. It is choice; but when necessity carries the matter a little farther into the winter, the feet break up in gashes, or “hacks;” hence hackit heelies.hackit heelies are hard as the airn, An litheless the lair o' the mitherless bairn! Aneath his cauld brow, siccan dreams tremble there, O' hands that wont kindly to kame his dark hair! But mornin' brings clutches, a' reckless an' stern, That lo'e nae the locks o' the mitherless bairn! Yon sister, that sang o'er his saftly-rocked bed, Now rests in the mools whaur her mammie is laid; The father toils sair their wee bannock to earn, An' kens nae the wrangs o' his mitherless bairn! Her spirit, that pass'd in yon hour o' his birth, Still watches his wearisome wand'rings on earth, Recording in heaven the blessings they earn, Wha couthilie deal wi' the mitherless bairn! Oh! speak him nae harshly—he trembles the while— He bends to your bidding, and blesses your smile! In their dark hour o' anguish, the heartless shall learn That God deals the blow for the mitherless bairn! THE WEDDED WATERS. Air—“Kind Robin lo'es me.” Gadie wi' its waters fleet, Ury wi' its murmur sweet, They hae trysted aye to meet Among the woods o' Logie. Like bride an' bridegroom happy they, Wooing smiles frae bank an' brae, Their wedded waters wind an' play Round leafy bowers at Logie. O'er brashy linn, o'er meadow fine, They never sinder, never tyne, An' oh! I thought sic meetings mine, Yon happy hours at Logie! But Fortune's cauld an' changefu' e'e, Gloomed bitterly on mine an' me, I looket syne, but cou'dna see My sworn love at Logie. Now lowly, lanely, I may rue The guilefu' look, the guilefu' vow, That fled as flees the feckless dew Frae withered leaves at Logie. But Gadie wi' its torrents keen It is on this stream, which, rising in the parish of Clatt, after a course of some miles, runs into the Ury, the following beautiful song was long ago written, and is well known to all the country:— “I wish I were whar Gadie rins, 'Mang fragrant heath and yellow whins, Or brawlin' doun the boskie lins, At the back o' Bein-na-chie! Ance mair to hear the wild birds' saing; To wander birks and braes amang, Wi' frien's an' fav'rites left so lang At the back o'Bein-na-chie. How mony a day in blythe spring time, How mony a day in simmer's prime, I've saunterin' whiled awa' the time, On the heights o' Bein-na-chie! Ah! fortune's flowers wi' thorns grow rife, And walth is won wi' toil and strife; Ae day gie me o' youthfu' life At the back o' Bein-na-chie. Ah! Mary, there on ilka night, When baith our hearts were young an' light, We've wander'd by the clear moonlight, Wi' speech baith fond and free. Oh! ance, ance mair, whar Gadie rins, Whar Gadie rins! whar Gadie rins, Oh! might I die whar Gadie rins, At the back o' Bein-na-chie!”, An' Ury wi' its braes sae green, They a' can tell how true I've been To my lost love in Logie. “OH, THAT MY LOVE WAS SO EASILY WON!” The burden line of a very old song, of which the two following lines are from the wearied lover, who says— “I'll buy an auld horse, and I'll hire an auld man, And hurl ye back to Northumberlan'.” “Oh that my love was so easily won!” Whaur nae love word was spoken; Unsought—unwoo'd, my heart had flown— I canna hide, I daurna own How that poor heart is broken. “Oh that my love was so easily won!” The gay an' the gallant hae woo'd me; But he—oh, he never sought to share The envied smile, yet mair an' mair Yon wordless look subdued me. “Oh, that my Love was so easily won!” Oh, that my life would restore him! He lightlied the love of our pridefu' clan— My dreams are fu' o' yon friendless man, But the wrath o' my kindred hangs o'er him. “Oh, that my Love was so easily won!” My kin will ye never forgie me? I've gi'en my heart to a hameless man, But I'll wander far frae this friendless lan', An' it never mair shall see me. A WISH. O Peggy waur your heart as free, As free as it is rare; I'd be a saint to worship thee, And build an altar there. Or could I wyle that heart awa, An' haud it aye my ain; Within this bosom's benmost ha', Never to flit again. I saw yon gleam o' sunny licht Spread o'er your gladsome brow, An' o', love lurks wi' fatal micht Aroun' your comely mow. Yet frae the brichtness o' that brow, There fa's nae licht for me; An' O! its sair to doat, I trow, On lips we daur'na pree. Ye bid me sing, an' fain would I Do a' ye bid me do; But aye my tremblin' lips deny— My tremblin' heart fills fou. But aft I'll sing the sang ye lo'e When your nae bye to hear, An' ilka soun' that pleasur'd you I'll welcome wi' a tear. SECOND LOVE. “The breast that has felt love justly shrinks from the idea of its total extinction as from annihilation itself.” Oh, say not Love will never Breathe in that breast again! That where he bled must ever All pleasureless remain. Shall tempest-riven blossom, When fair leaves fall away, In coldness close its bosom 'Gainst beams of milder day? Oh never, nay! It blooms where'er it may. Though ruthless tempest tear— Though biting frosts subdue, And leave no tendril where Love's pretty flow'rets grew; The soil all ravaged so Will nurture more and more, And stately roses blow Where daisies droop'd before; Then why, oh! why Should sweet love ever die? ADDRESS TO THE DON. Don rises in Strathdon and receives (besides other small rivers) Nochty, from Invernochty; Bucket, from Glenbucket; and Ury from Inverury parishes. It falls into the sea at Old Aberdeen, where it has a fair bridge of one arch, built four ages ago, about A.D. 1320, by King Robert Bruce, while this see was vacant by the flight of Bishop Cheyne—the bridge of Balgownie, celebrated by Lord Byron's reminiscences. The length of the river Don from above the kirk of Alford is twenty miles, and twenty-four miles from the said kirk to the bridge of Balgownie where Don discharges his streams in the German Ocean close by Old Aberdeen. The mountain Benachie, rising with seven tops, on the south is precipitous and rocky, and is a sea mark. The river Ury rising in a low hill, not far from the Castle of Gartly, passing through a sterile valley, whence it struggles through the narrows of the hills, coming down upon the plain which it divides unequally, with its twisting channel, falls into the Don at the little town of Inverury. At the foot and along the whole length of Benachie, the small stream of the Gadi falls into the Ury a little above the same town.—[Robert Gordon, of Straloch—Description of Sheriffdoms of Aberdeen and Banff, 1654.] “Will it fair up do you think?” “Aye will 't yet.” Gossip. “The deil and Don came down that day, Wi' a' their Highland fury; An' vowed to “bear the Bass away,” Frae bonnie tremblin' Ury.” Dark Don, thy water's rude repulsive scowl And frothy margin, all too well bespeak The upland ravages, the conflict bleak Of mountain winter; and the maddened howl Of bruiting elements, distraught and foul, Have ruffled thy fair course and chok'd thy braes. Love flies affrightened at thy swollen look; h e laverock may not hear its own sweet lays O'er thy fierce chafings, and the timid brook Sinks trembling amid thy surfy maze, Thou cold remembrancer of wilder human ways! So soiled the social tide by some curst deed Of ancient ruffian or fool—so ages read To weeping worlds of hearts that bled, Of patriots and sages that have died Ere that broad stream was half repurified. Roll thy dark waters, Don—we yet shall see On thy bright bosom the fair symmetry Of vaulted heaven, when the shrill lark pours Voluptuous melody to listening flowers, And all of man, of earth, and air shall feel What hate and darkness hurteth, love and light can heal! For who so dull that may not now behold Yon cloud-repelling light, yon moral ray Piercing the night-born mist, the murky fold, That erst obscured the intellectual day? God breathes again in man—those melt, for aye, Preparing, purifying to the sacred birth Of virtues hitherto undared on earth. WHISPER LOW. Slowly, slowly the cauld moon creeps Wi' a licht unlo'esome to see; It dwalls on the window whaur my love sleeps, An' she winna wauken to me. Wearie, wearie the hours, and slow, Wauken, my lovie, an' whisper low! There's nae ae sang in heaven's hicht, Nor on the green earth doun, Like soun's that kind love kens at nicht, When whispers hap the soun'; Hearin'—fearin'—sichin' so— Whisper, my bonnie lovie, whisper low! They lack nae licht wha weel can speak In love's ain wordless wile; Her ee-bree creepin' on my cheek Betrays her pawkie smile; Happy—happy—silent so— Breathin'—bonnie lovie, whisper low! Was yon a waft o' her wee white han', Wi' a warnin' “wheesht” to me? Or was it a gleam o' that fause moon fa'in' On my puir misguided e'e? Wearie—wearie—wearie O— Wauken, my lovie, an' whisper low! GLAMOURIE; OR, MESMERISM AS WE HAVE IT AT INVERURY. Air—“Aiken Drum.” A carlie cam' to our toun, An' bade our drumster rair an' soun', Till a' the fouk ran rinnin' doun T' see fat they could see. Fat think ye o' the carlie, The glowrin' fykin' carlie, The fell auld-fashion'd carlie, Wi' a' his glamourie? Some cam' wi' faith, some cam' wi' fear, An' monie cam' frae far an' near, Wi' nae a few that cam' to sneer, An' oh, they lookit slee! An' bureght roun' the carlie, An' wonnert at the carlie, An' cried “Fa are ye carlie? An' fat a' can ye dee?” He took my auntie by the thumb, An' grippet aye my auntie's thumb, An' aye he squeez'd my auntie's thumb, An' glowr'd intill her e'e. Out fie the fu'some carlie!

His Meggy's heart it flew an' lap, For weel I wot kent she. But aye the rubbin' carlie, He blew an' blastit sairly, Till legs an' armies fairly Stood stark like ony tree! Ye Debtors deft,—ye Cravers keen, A story was current at Inverury that a creditor (craver) had been mesmerized, and left asleep by his “debtor deft.” Ye Lovers, too, wha roam alane, Ne'er look ower lang in ither's een, In case o' what might be! For gin ye meet a carlie, A keekin' cunnin' carlie, Ye yet may rue richt sairly The glamour o' his e'e. SCHOOL OF INDUSTRY. [A School of Industry exists in the city of Aberdeen, in which destitute orphans, and the children of poverty-stricken parents, are gathered together from the haunts of misery and vice, and put in the way of earning an honest livelihood. Here let curiosity, if not kindness, plead for one visit. If they will not heed yon grim old house, and the helpless outcasts there, then are we not accountable in whole for the impiety of wishing that this luckless school had, even at the risk of indwelling cormorants, some share in the beef and boilings attached to other nests. But, alas! no droppings here. Here the cook—honest woman!—may lick her fingers as innocently as if she licked a milestone. Nothing in that meagre building to attract an itchy palm—no elegance therein to reward the soft eye of taste(?)—nor atone for prunella spoiled; so, hapily, neither come. Yet, oh! there is something there will one day speak in words of fire; and when that voice goes forth, happy are they and blessed who have looked in sorrowing kindness on yon shreds of bruised humanity! “There is hope in heaven—on earth despair.” One thinks it is written on the door, and speaking through each window—so chilly and forlorn looks our School of Industry! Yet those cold grey granite walls hold an hundred almost sinless hearts in safety. These, but the other day, were gathered from your lanes and entries—from perdition to peace. There they are—look on them; a fountain amidst a desert of souls—a redemption on earth—the rescued—the snatchings from the kingdom of darkness. Yet; there is a treasure therein will yet speak salvation to the godly minds that placed it there. Ye that care but for the hour that passes, look to your safety—ye heedlessly happy! Know ye not that, in turning the human impulses from a wrong to a right direction, ye are adding to your other sweets the sweet of security; and, by lessening the number of thieves, ye may eat your crowning custard in calmness, and lessen the chances of losing your dear “three courses.” Go to yon grim residence of forsaken humanity; look carefully at these sharplike little fellows, and think of your own safety. They came not to your world unbidden, and they will live. Look at them again—fine, rude, raw material there, ready to be manufactured for better, for worse. Think of the thing in an economical posture. In these hundred boys, as they are being trained, you have an equivalent for a thousand patent locks, forty policemen, four goals, two transports, and one hangman. Look on these lads again—then turn to that little box, if you have a sigh and a sixpence about you—God bless you, leave the sixpence at any rate! There comes the monitor, leading in two ragged little strangers—brothers they seem. That look of the elder boy searcher for one's heart, and should find it too, as his lustrous blue eye fills over his only “kin”—his little brother—already gladdening under the strange comfort of shelter. You gave the sixpence? Well, is the monitor's song please you, give the sigh, too, and “Haste ye back.” THE MONITOR'S SONG Air—“Prince Charlie's farewell to Skye.” Come Brither bairnies, wan and worn, And hide ye here frae cauld and scorn; The blast that tears your weary morn May fan your warmer day, boys. We work and wish, and sich and sing, And bless the couthie hearts that bring Ae smile to soothe our surly spring; We'll a' be men when we may, boys! Your Mither sank before the lave— Your Father, Sister, sought a grave; And ye wee bodies, were left to crave A warl's cauldrife care, boys! But now ye'll work, and hope, and sing, Nor needfu' fear how fate may fling; The Honey may come ahint the Sting, And Heaven will send your share, boys! Oh! were the heartless here to see The wrestling tear that fills your e'e, Your wee, wee Brith'rie, daft wi' glee, Wi' breast and armies bare, boys! But aft unkent we greet and sing, And ply the warp and netting string; Oh! wha would slight that holy thing, An orphan's trembling prayer, boys? A hundred hearts are heaving here, That loup to gladness, grief, and fear; And weel bless they the lips that speir How orphans fend and fare, boys! Oh! blithely work and blithely sing— There's nane can tell what Time may bring, Sae freckl'd the feathers that mark his wing, So changefu' evermair, boys! THE STRICKEN BRANCH. [Whoever he is whose destiny leads him from “the spot where he was born,” let him prepare for many queer things, even in our own enlightened land. Is he a journeyman weaver? shoemaker? tailor? Then just let him try to set up doing for himself in a small country town. If he does not “catch it” then from the brotherhood (brotherhood?), he is one in whom Providence assuredly takes a special interest. In every small community there is a vehement working of the Keep-out system, which is only changed for the Keep-down. A stranger is never welcome beyond the rule of “buy and come again.” The “Income” is a denounced animal. To wrong him in name and property is all for the common weal. The following is reluctantly inserted to show how far human Ingratitude may be carried—reluctantly, because these verses seem to bear on some vagrant misfortune of the writer, and to reflect on the Sympathy, Justice, and Liberality of our enlightened, Free-trade-loving, Universal-brotherhood-advocating, fellow Burgher, Bailie Thinclaith.] 'Twas a cauld cauld nicht, and a bauld bauld nicht, When the mad wind scoured the plain; An' monie bonnie bush lay streiket and bare, Drown'd deid in the pelting rain. The lilac fell a' broken and bent, Wi' the leafless woodbine torn and rent; And aye as the storm would swither and swell, Anither bush brak'—anither bush fell. A Nettle stood strong in his native mud, Rank King o'er his native bog; He withered aye in the clear daylight, But he fattened aye in the fog. He stung every flow'ret,—cursed every sweet: He spared nae the Docken that happit his feet; For this was the song that the auld Nettle sung, “Darkness and dung, Beetles, darkness and dung!” [And the black Beetles chorus it, “Darkness and dung!”] In that cauld lang nicht, in that dark lang nicht, When the wild winds scoured the plain, An unkent Branch of an unkent tree Was tossed near the Nettle's domain. An' the weary—weed-like—withering thing, Lay low at the lair of that Nettle king; Where nane might dare a byding place, But that King and his kindred Hemlock race. The bonniest half o' that Branch sank deid, An' its wee, wee bud unseen; The ither took root an' reared its heid, Wi' its twa three Twigs alane. Heaven, pitying, held the wild wind fast, An' the Stricken Branch out-lived the blast; The kindly Sunbeam settled there, The branches braid'ning mair and mair; And monie bonnie bird wi' willing wing, Had welcome there to nestle and sing. But, oh! how the Nettle grew grim and dark, An' fumed in the shadow beneath: How he bullied his legion of Beetles black! An' his Hemlock dews of death! The Beetles sought sair for a fallen leaf,— But the hundred eyes of the Hemlock Chief Could reach no farther than just to see The deep, deep green of the Stranger Tree. THE FISHERMEN. [To record a sympathy in the well-earned gratitude owned by all to Lieutenant Dooley and his brave crew, is the best apology at hand for taking this long hold of the “Herald.” I don't know Lieutenant Dooley, nor any other lieutenant, but I know there is more good in saving one fisherman than in sinking seven ships—barring the glory thereof. “Weel may the boatie row, And better may she speed.” We had the gratification, on Thursday afternoon, of witnessing one of the most affecting scenes that a person could have much chance of encountering in the course of a long life. It was no less than the meeting of fifty-three fishermen, whose lives had for a time been despaired of by their rejoicing relatives. It was a scene that no philanthropist should have lost, and one that none who witnessed it will be ready to forget. About four o'clock on the morning of New-year's day, the boats belonging to this port put out to sea, trusting to the appearance of the weather. A part remained inshore, while nine of them made for the deep-water fishing. About six o'clock the moon set in a thick lowering bank in the north-west. The portentous omen was read aright by the fishermen, who, putting “up helm,” rowed with might and main for the shore. The boats near the coast succeeded in reaching it; but the others were taken by the hurricane eight miles from land, and although they struggled on with stout hearts and willing hands, the wind, waves, and blinding snow were all against them, and, instead of making any headway, they drifted before the tempest. The wives and children, fathers and mothers of the missing fishermen, looked upon themselves as bereaved of their only earthly support, and the objects of their fondest affection. Of some families there were three, of others four, amissing; and the greater part were more or less connected with one another. To almost every house the touching language of the prophet might have been applied—“There was a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted, because they were not.” Through Monday night and Tuesday, this dreadful suspense continued; and eagerly was the post of Wednesday morning waited for, as the ultimatum that should extinguish the little remnant of hope that was clung to by the unhappy community, or bring the anxiously prayed for news of the safety of their friends. The preservation of all was scarcely to be looked for, but their fondest hopes were more than realized. Intelligence came that all were safe; and when the glad tidings were carried to Footdee, The fishing station. the sudden revulsion from the extremity of sorrow to that of joy was evinced by the warmest transports, after a thousand fashions. Some poured forth warm, heartfelt thanks, some weeped, some danced, some sang; but one feeling animated all—the deepest, purest, and most intense joy that can fall upon the heart of man. The fishermen, after struggling for hours against the tempest, lost all hope of outliving it. Their boats were fast filling with water, and becoming entirely unmanageable; and, even had there been any possibility of working them, the poor men, with a few exceptions, were unable to stir themselves; they had become completely exhausted, and so benumbed with the piercing cold, as to be incapable of handling their oars. Death, in two forms, was staring them in the face, certain in the one or other. There was help at hand, however, when least expected. The Greyhound cutter on this station, commanded by Lieutenant Dooley, while running before the wind, came in sight of the boats about eleven o'clock, off Findonness, and bore up to them. The greatest difficulty existed in taking the men from their frail crafts. Some of them were old and feeble, and in such a state, from wet and exposure, that made it necesary, as seamen say, to “parbuncle” them; while the storm had risen to such a height that the mainsail of the cutter was carried away, and her work of mercy in some measure retarded. A try-sail was, however, soon hoisted in its place, and after an hour or two, the whole of the poor men were stowed away in warm berths or dry clothing, and all their wants most kindly attended to by the warm-hearted commander and his gallant crew. Nor did their endeavours cease with the preservation of the lives of the fishermen; every attempt was made to save their property likewise. The boats were all made fast astern by a five-inch hawser, but the increasing storm dashed them one by one against another, stove them in, and soon rendered it necessary to set them adrift. The cutter then made for the Firth of Forth, and the whole of the fishermen were landed at Leither. At four o'clock on Thursday afternoon, the whole of the fishermen reached their homes, when the scene was the most touching that could be imagined. About six or seven hundred in all were present—young and old—men, women, and children.—Aberdeen Herald.] LINES SUGGESTED BY THE ABOVE DISASTER. 'Twas the blythe New Year, when the hearts are mov'd Like fairy wind harp ringing, To the breathing smile of friend belov'd, In whisper dear—in noisy cheer— Nae fash, nae fear—the good New Year Sets the good old world a-singing. But, oh! it is dark in the fisherman's cot, With the lively and lovely there; Tho' the cold, cold wind, with its icy throat, Falls fiercely—yet one hears it not, Thro' sob, and sigh, and prayer. So that should be—when the terrible sea Speaks woe to the trembling earth— Hope wing'd away with the closing day, Now cold despair wraps all things there, And scowls o'er the fisherman's hearth. Man dies but once—oh! say it not! He lives again to die, Whom the surly, surly sea has taught The hope-dissolving sigh; When the stubborn arm that strains for life Falls feebly on the oar; When the loved last look of child and wife Swims wildly o'er the settling strife, Oh, Death! what canst thou more? LINES TO MISS LUCY LAWRENCE OTTLEY. Written at Naish, July, 1841. You may not love the lay Unhallow'd by a tear, And she that's far away Claims all that I can spare; But when I let her ken, How ye have pleasured me, She winna grudge it then Ae parting tear to thee. When other hours recall The joys that I ha'e seen In England's happy hall, On England's flowery green, When my own native lark Floats o'er my native lea, What can I then but mark Its kindred melody? For never yet mair sweet, Has lark or mavis sung; And, oh! that face to meet That saftly witching tongue! My lastening heart will prize Your sang o' sweetness mair Than carols frae the skies, Wi' a' its gladness there. My lowland lassie sings Far sweeter than the rest; And a' her leal heart rings In sangs that I love best. Sae whan her soul-filled strain Fa's trembling on my ear, Oh! but I'll mind them then,— The sangs you sang me here. When o'er thy violet brow, And on thy changing cheek, And 'neath that breast of snow, A thousand throbbings speak. Oh, may the favoured ane Thy fair perfections see! And love with love alane Befitting heaven and thee. KNOCKESPOCK'S LADY. [An ancestor of JAMES ADAM GORDON, Esq., the present Laird of Knockespock, about a century and a half ago, in a second marriage had taken to wife the lovely Jean Leith of Harthill. His affectionate lady watched the chamber of her sick husband by day and by night, and would not divide her care with any one. Worn out and wasted from continual attendance on him, she fell into a sleep, and was awakened only by the smoke and flames of their burning mansion; the menials had fled—the doom of the dying laird and his lady seemed fixed. In her heroic affection she bore her husband from the burning house, laid him in a sheltered spot, and forced her way back to the tottering stair, through the very flames, for “plaids to wrap him in.”] Ae wastefu' howl o'er earth an' sea, Nae gleam o' heaven's licht Might mark the bounds o' Benachie That black and starless nicht. Siclike the nicht, siclike the hour, Siclike the wae they ken, Wha watch till those lov'd eyes shall close That ne'er may ope again. As gin to tak' the last lang look, He raised a lichtless e'e; Now list, oh, thou, his lady wife, Knockespock speaks to thee! “Sit doun, my Jeanie Gordoun love, Sit doun an' haud my head; There's sic a lowe beneath my brow Maun soon, soon be my dead. “Aye whaur ye find the stoun, oh, Jean! Press tae your kindly hand; I wadna gi'e ae breath o' thee For a' else on my land. Your couthie word dreeps medicine, Your very touch can heal; An', oh, your e'e does mair for me Than a' our doctor's skill!” She leant athwart his burnin' brow, Her tears lap lichtly doun; Beneath her saft, saft, dautin' hand Knockespock sleepit soun'. For woman's watch is holiness— In woman's heart, sae rare, When a' the warld is cauld an' dark, There's licht an' litheness there! What's yon that tints the deep dark brae, An' flickers on the green? It's nae the ray o' morning grey, Nor yet the bonnie meen! Drumminor's bloody Ha' is bright, Kildrummie's sna' tower clear, An' Noth's black Tap ca's back the licht To gowden Dunnideer. Yon gleed o'er fast and fiercely glows, For licht o' livin' star, An' lo! it marks wi' giant brows, The murky woods o' Mar. The drowsy deer is fain to flee, Beyond Black Arthur's hicht; An' birdies lift a timorous e'e, To yon ill-bodin' licht. Whaur Bogie flows, and Huntly shows On high its lettered wa's; An' westward far on Cabrach's breast, The ruddy glimmerin' fa's. Whaur monie a Forbes and Gordoun sleeps, On Tillyangus deein'; An' Mar's road sweeps, 'mid their cairn's grey heaps, The fiery flakes are fleein'. An' aye the flare that reddens there, Knockespock weel may rue; Nor Gadie's stream can dit the gleam That wraps his dwallin' noo. Yet woman's love, Oh, woman's love! The wide unmeasured sea Is nae so deep as woman's love, As her sweet sympathy! Upon the wet an' windy sward She wadna lat him down, But wiled an' wiled the lithest beild Wi' breckans happet roun'. Knockespock's cauld, he's deadly cauld— Whaur has his lady gane! How has she left him trembling there, A' trembling there alane? An' has she gane for feckless gowd, To tempt yon fearfu' lowe? Or is her fair mind, wreck'd an' wrang, Forgane its guidance now? She fearless speels the reekin' tow'r, Tho' red, red is the wa', An' braves the deaf'nin' din an' stour, Whaur cracklin' rafters fa'. It is na gowd, nor gallant robes, Gars Jeanie Gordoun rin; But she has wiled the saftest plaids To wrap her leal lord in. For woman's heart is tenderness, Yet woman weel may dare The deftest deed, an' tremble nane, Gin true love be her care. “The lowe has scaith'd your locks, my Jean, An' scorch'd your bonnie brow; The graceless flame consumes our hame— What thinks my lady now?” “My locks will grow again, my love, My broken brow will men', Your kindly breast's the lealest hame That I can ever ken; “But, Oh, that waesome look o' thine, Knockespock, I wad gi'e The livin' heart frae out my breast For aught to pleasure thee!” Weel, woman's heart! ay, woman's heart! There grows a something there, The sweetest flower on bank or bower Maun nane wi' that compare. THE HOMES OF MISERY. Air.—Miller of Dee. While we laugh and sing in this happy ring, With a bright and brotherly glee, May we never forget that the sun may set On the homes of misery. Chorus—Then aye as we sing may we closer cling In our bright and brotherly glee; But never forget that the sun hath set On the homes of misery. For oh, it may be that the chill night's wind Sweeps round some fireless hearth, Freezing the heart of the homeless ones, With never a friend on earth. Then aye as we sing, &amp;c. Man was not made for this world alone,— The world was lent to man; 'Tis a debt we own to heaven, you know; Then pay it as well as you can. Then aye as we sing, &amp;c. Now winter rides mad in his carriage of snow, With his rain and pelting hail: May it never be said that hunger and woe Held a bidding in bonnie Dean Vale. Then aye as we sing, &amp;c. JUSTICE—A REVERIE. Ance wild in woods wi' brither brute, Man hunted day by day; An' reive, wi' fell and fierce dispute, The wolf's half-worried prey. Then roughest niggers ruled the fray, Fouk awn'd nae ither micht; An' Justice daur'd nocht word to say, But noo an' than “Guid nicht!” An' sleepit syne. Bauld man grew bigger and got breeks, An' haul'd their huts thegither; Syne cultivated kail an' leeks, An' ate nae ane anither. The heart leant brither-like to brither— Love ruled wi' little fyke; An' lasses, lauchin', tauld their mither That they “be't do the like.” An' buckled syne. Aye, lighter aye—ilk glimmer threw A brichter gleam lay on it; Frae holes to huts, huts houses grew, Man shaved an' wore a bonnet! The gudewife wi' sic power enthronat An' bairnie on her knee; Whilk she could either scaul or scone it, Just as the case micht be. An' daut it syne. Ane hunder years, an' mair than that, Had drousy Justice snor'd; Till fouk in very peace grew fat, In very easedom smor'd; At last an' lang, wi' ae accord, Upon a summer night, They loudly on the lady roar'd, Wha wauken'd in a fright, An' wonnert syne. The dozen'd goddess e'ed the fouk, An' fairlied at their fury; Glour'd wi' a face as braid's our clock At bonnie Inverury. “What would ye noo, ye sons o' muck— Wha reive me o' my sleepin'? May ha'f the warl's unholy luck Fast haud ye in its keepin; An' rot ye syne!” A stark auld man, toom, dour an' thin, Stood talesman by the “rote',” His banes stared 'neath his withered skin, An' time had bared his coat. “Our kirk,” quoth he, “endures a spot Upon her fair repute, An' water winna wash the blot, Nor Gospel wring it out. It's sickar syne. Our fa'en guides hae racht an' wrung An' pouch'd the slave-won plack; In very kernal conscience flung, An' wail'd, ‘Fie! send it back!’ We'll gie on earth our wealth—our wrack, We'll gar our bairns gang duddy; Ere we connive wi' heathen Black, God send ilk wight a wuddy! An' hang 'im syne.” Now merry Justice held her sides To keep her ribs frae rackin'; She leuch until her e'en ran tides, Her very saul was shakin'. Sae funny were the thoughts that wauken To hear the duddy crew— “What slave” quo' she, “tholes ha'f sic whackin' As whacks dealt down on you, Aye silent syne? “O seek nae mair for siller's birth, Aye pouch—but binna speerin'; There's nae a bodle tracks the earth That has na brought a tear in— Think ye yon holy house ye're rearin' Will spotless pennies pay it? When some are sawin'—some are shearin'— Some are makin' hay yet To sell it syne!” SOMETHING ABOUT DIMPLES: THEIR USE AND ORIGIN. Your Helen's eye it speaketh yet— Maybe with half its former sheen, And that same cheek where roses met May lack the brightness that hath been. Time, onward in his withering stride, Will dim the eye, will sear the skin; But yon kirk-yard alone can hide That dimple on your Helen's chin. But guess ye how her dimple's made? I'll tell, for that full well I know— A naughty little angel stray'd, To have a frolic here below:— The infant Helen cradled lay, All fair as aught of earth might be; Heaven's tiny truant pass'd that way To see—whatever he could see. “My eye! what have we here?” he cries— “Can earth claim all this pretty elf? Or is it one hath left the skies, To go a roaming like myself?” He touched the eyebrow—touched the cheek— He vowed she was of mortal kin; Kissing the lips, o'er young to speak, He delved yon dimple with his chin. These fairy honey cups at first Were formed for folks beneath the sky, Till, mad beyond all mortal thirst,— Some jolly angels drained them dry. Dear woman—mindful aye enough— Found smirks and sighs, and sulks and tears, The very, very kind of stuff To lull her domineering dears. Man eats as he had never err'd— He drinks as he had never eaten Yon deadly fruit; nor wisely cared What thorny way it lured his feet in. He, mildly thankful, happy man— The cup is his—the power is given To make the most that e'er he can, Of all the cast by bits of heaven. CHANTS FOR CHURLS. Ken ye carls howkin' out, Wha darena howk within, Holy wark gies your sark, Yer siller, an' yer sheen. Gae mak' a fyke to feed the kirk, Although ye starve yer kin, An' ye'll be lauchin' lairdies yet, Youplin in yer yardies yet, Heich ayont the moon. We've kirks in ilka corner, An' wow but we can preach; Timmer tap, little sap, Onything for bread. Their sermons in the draw well, Drink till ye stretch. We're clean sairt sookin' at it, The deil's dazed lookin' at it: Daud him on the head. Sawtan said to Sin, “Bairn, Whither shall we flee, Wi' your pit, an' my net, An' a' our little deils? Sic musterin' o' ministers, They'll droon us in the sea; Wi' their auld taurds whippin' at us, New brooms sweepin' at us: Hunted to the heels.” “Sit siccar on yer seat, Sawtan, Binna feart o' wark; In but or ben, heicht or glen, Ye'll get a deevil nurst; For priests hae crusht the crousie out, They're fechtin' in the dark, An' gouks a' tearin' ither, Shorin' ither, shearin' ither, Bannin' like to burst. “While the black breed's breedin' aye, Like weel corned beasts, Out or in sic a din, Moderate or high, I'll big a house wi' beadles yet, An' thack it wi' orra priests; For they're aye blythe bodies to me, Aye make roadies to me, Unco few gae by.” FAREWELL TO LONDON. I'm sick o' this Babel, sae heartless an' cauld, It's din winna suit wi' my nature ava'— We canna graff branches when wither'd an' auld— It's time, gentle friends, I were toddling awa'. I fain would be hame, I would fain be alane, In my cottar-house, tramping my treddles again. I'm no made for mingling in fashion's gay thrang, I'm oot o' my element acting the part, Far better I lo'e to be crooning a sang By the blythe chimley-cheek wi' the friends o' my heart; Whiles blawing a cloud, and whiles blawing a note, As my cutty or flute comes first in my thought. I'll no be a lion for ermined rank, I winna be trotted or roar any more; I scorn Mr. Pelf as he rolls to his bank— The weaver is sterling and proud at the core. My thoughts are my ain, I can beck not nor boo, Duke Supple may cringe, but the weaver is true. I ne'er see the sun in this dull foggy toon, Though I whiles get a glimpse o' the calm leddy meen— Bless, bless her sweet face, blinking couthily doon On my ain canny, ain bonnie, dear Aberdeen! O when shall I greet thee, again shall I see Thy soft light reflected in clear-flowing Dee? Farewell to thee, Caudle, an' weel may ye thrive, Who raised me to fame with a dash o' thy pen; A better mate to thee when next thou shalt wive— A blessing be aye on thy but an' thy ben. Frae auld Aristarchus to Jeffrey the 'cute, Come show me the critic can stand in thy boot! Success to thee, Caudle! success to the crew Round Punch's guffawing but sovereign board, Determined that all shall have fairly their due— Now raising a weaver—now roasting a lord— Now snubbing a Jenkins—now higher they go, To clatter a steenie at Albert's chapeau. And farewell, Knockespock, my patron and chief— Maccenas, Glencairn, and father to me! My heart-string may crack, but I'll nae get relief Till the tears fa' in showers on the banks o' the Dee. What pillow sae saft that can lull to repose As the green velvet banks where my dear river flows? Then hyhe o'er the water, for now I'm awa' To breathe caller air by my Ury again; Though Jeanie nae langer can answer my ca', I pant for my hame, I am weary and fain. Come, rouse ye, my merry men, bind ye the sail, An' let us awa on the wings o' the gale!</field>
