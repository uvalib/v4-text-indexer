      <field name="fulltext">ADDRESS TO A VIRGINIAN CREEPER; OR THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY FROM ASSOCIATIONS WITH VISIBLE OBJECTS. Paradise, and groves Elysian. Fortunate fields—like those of old Sought in the Atlantic main, why should they be A history only of departed things, Or a mere fiction of what never was?— For the discerning intellect of man, When wedded to this goodly universe In love and holy passion, shall find these A simple product of the common day. Wordsworth's Excursion. 1 Fair plant, I see thee with a yearning spirit, For thou remind'st me of another place;— And this spot, though it cannot boast a merit Beyond retirement's unobtrusive grace, From thy pervading influence doth inherit One feature, whence the curious mind may trace A likeness 'twixt it, and a scene elysian, See the description of the Author's residence in the North of England, in the third book of “Desultory Thoughts in London;” particularly that part of it where the parasitical plants are mentioned with which it was embowered., Such as might bless some favoured poet's vision! 2 As mind of plastic mould we often view, Of swift mobility of temperament, In opposite extremes its course pursue!— Yet in this giddy whirl of sentiment (Fine as the film, whose being the dropped dew Alone revealed, its surface which besprent) A vestige dwells, unseen of human eye Inly betraying its identity. 3 In such mind, absent friends, and absent things, Having forgotten, as a hue, a scent, A sound, may touch upon those finer strings Which call these objects from their banishment; So thou, fair plant, when towards thee mine eye flings Its sudden glance (thought all things else prevent Feelings, whence this scene might the past restore) Canst call up visions dear to me of yore. 4 Oh, never say to him who has a heart;— Oh, never say to him who has a sense, Imagination, of the joys which dart, From unseen source, beneath thy influence;— Oh, never say to him who has the art To waken that deep feeling and intense, Whence is with curious speculation viewed Similitude in dissimilitude;— 5 Oh, never say to these, that there can be, In this wide world, one vacant dwelling place: A place, which he, who is with phantasy Endowed, may not with richest treasures grace!— Say not to him, who has of poesy The lofty gift, that he's bereft of space For soaring thought, since his allotted home, Monotonous, forbids his eyes to roam. 6 No! In the eye that sees, the heart that feels, And in th' imagination which controuls All forms, that is there which profusion steals From what were penury to meagre souls!— And add to this, that contrast See motto (from Rosseau's Confessions) to “Desultory Thoughts in London,” and stanza 39, p. 62, of the Poem on the Language and Subjects most fit for Poetry. oft reveals A source of inspiration, and unrolls Oft through the sense which a drear blank surrounds, Glories which pass reality's scant bounds. 7 This is a sensuous age! We scarce can tell Whether most pitiful it is, and poor, When wood, rocks, lakes, and mountains weave a spell The heart to melt, the fancy to allure, With blank indifference on the whole to dwell:— Or not to know, that, when high thoughts obscure Man's lower impulses, he well may scorn The circumscribing sway of forms earth-born. 8 As there no time is, so there is no place, For him uplifted by imagination!— He soars o'er all the little bounds of space:— And his own world is of his own creation!— 'Tis poor to think, the noble mind to raise, That need should be of objects of sensation:— 'Tis poor to think, that, e'en the prison's gloom, Must be his mind's, since 'tis his body's tomb. 9 I thank thee, beauteous plant, because that thou Remindest me of far more gorgeous scene! A residence which the Author possessed near the Lake of Winandermere: for a description of which see “Desultory Thoughts in London,” third book, p. 129, stanza 23, beginning “I had a cottage in a paradise.” His dwelling on this spot was overgrown with the plant here celebrated.— But far, far more for this, my grateful vow To thee I raise,—(when, as from freshest green, To delicate vermeil, and to crimson, now, I see thee changing)—since the thought serene,— (Inspired by thee, familiar to my glance), Comes o'er my spirit, as with rapturous trance, 10 That thou a link art of a mighty chain!— A living presence art, a fiery tress, To the leaves of the Virginia Creeper may be well applied the lines of Mr. Coleridge— “The hanging woods which, touched by autumn, seem As they were blossoming hues of fire and gold,” as in the decline of the year, they are of the richest crimson, orange, and yellow. Conspicuous to my sight, and dost a train Of fair experience outwardly express!— E'en as I still my former self retain! Although I inly feel, that, not the less, In some things I am changed, thou, like a thread Of fairy woof, dost past to present wed!— 11 As in long voyage on the perilous ocean, Though not a trace on any side be seen Of land, though all around the feared commotion Of winds, waves, clouds, and darkening mists, between The eye, and the mind's hope, perplex all notion; Yet still the little loadstone, with serene, And superintendant constancy, doth keep Its delicate guidance o'er the yawning deep. 12 So in the tempest of life's blackest hours, Forms such as we have seen in happiest days, Not by association's mystic powers, Consolatory feelings only raise, But oft from thence (mild as the scent of flowers When on their dewy buds fall morn's first rays) An intertwining with the days gone by Pledges assurance of futurity. 13 These so recurring forms, from time to time, From place to place, thus opportunely met,— Like beacons to the mariner;—in clime Distant and perilous, like land-marks set;— So, with a sense of what is real, chime With all those yearnings which would not forget The past, that each of them appears to be Propitious herald of futurity. 14 Who has not felt in mental wretchedness;— Or when portentously disease has wrought O'er all the being with so rude a stress, That it has almost choked the stream of thought,— Who, when some big calamity did press On life's progressiveness, till it has brought A sudden check to purpose;—that a toy, Raised from the past, could blackest spells destroy? 15 Once by a conflict of deep suffering wrung, As by St. Patrick's Ulswater. In the vale at the head of Ulswater, there is a well which was formerly dedicated to St. Patrick, whence, the Author believes, this vale is called Patterdale, a corruption of Patrick's dale.— Cumberland, the Poet, styles Ulswater “Imperial Lake of Patrick's dale.” awful lake I strayed;— (E'en as the fatal robe Alcides flung Around his form which poison did pervade, So closely to his mighty members clung That he to rend it off vain efforts made; Thus was the pest of agony to me, And so invincible its agency). 16 Once in such mood—the crisis of despair— I, from the chafing wave, a pebble chose;— Exclaiming, “this I will preserve with care!— “Since” (though the thought in me then strongly rose That no alleviation whatsoe'er Could ever balm my agonizing throes) “Should I look on it in a future grief, This grief surmounted, it might bring relief.” 17 This very thought seemed then like prophecy!— Who that has dared in deepest of despair To act the part of hope,—who that, with eye Internal, o'er a bridgeless gulph could rear An edifice fantastic!—who, when dry, Dead to the world, pledged, in that moment drear, Himself to another in some fateful deed, Whose doing seemed all credence to exceed;— 18 Such, and no other, can my meaning guess! 'Tis in the pathless ether beacons rearing! Giving a when, and where, to nothingness; Through unessential vacancy careering; 'Tis bodying with the tongue's audaciousness What minds forswear unhoping and unfearing; 'Tis trying in the midst of inanition To affect to will, when there is no volition. 19 It is in short—(can any words imply The dim and dark suggestion)—'tis a deed Whence we impersonate defyingly Purposeless purposes; and since no heed Of life we take, and deem it all a lie; We stake the future,—(though to us indeed There be no future)—our entire fate stake, As we for chess-men did our fellows take. 20 A promise, in despair, seems hope's best theme; Our inner will reality alone Retains;—like stepping stones across a stream, So seem the acts by which we clench our own With other's fates; the world a grave doth seem And we like spectres of oblivion; We wander up and down, as if we were Shrunk to one thought of passionless despair. 21 I could, as then I thought, never know more Of dim, foreboding, and foreclosing pain, Than then I knew: yet were this anguish o'er, And I should thus be visited again, This little stone,—though hope's diminish'd lore— To this were circumscribed—would breathe this strain— “Despair, when first thou knewest this, was with thee! “Thou hast since hoped. What has been, still may be! 22 This looking forward, then the little all Of hope that I had left, this dim and drear Presentiment, that something might befall; And that futurity of all but fear Was not quite barren—if I such may call Comfort—my only comfort did appear.— Yet has that stone in after days of scath Suggested many a haunting of meek faith. 23 So the elected Joshua, chapter the fourth. Israelites of old, By God commanded, when they reached thy shore, O'erflowing Jordan, each one as we are told, Stones of memorial on their shoulders bore. These were to be, as future ages rolled, To distant generations evermore A sign, whence they the hallowed spot might mark, Where Jordan's waves retreated from the ark. 24 Thus, as a symbol of past gone despair O'ercome, in present sorrow may avail; Or to the mind suggestions may repair Of wisdom thence, when carnal joys assail:— So may a symbol of past joy declare Tidings of hope, when hope's resources fail; So by a symbol of past pleasure fled, May we in pleasure be admonished. 25 But this is foreign to my theme! The thought Inspiring it was of that feeling dim Which every soul possesses, when by aught It is impressed, which seems as 'twere to trim The lamp of life afresh, since it hath caught (As from the live coal which the Seraphim On th' altar placed, Isaiah caught his function) From its discovery a vital unction. 26 Whence is it that the meanest forms we hallow, Of utensils, for daily life designed?— Whence is it that all men, save those who wallow In sensual brutishness, and unrefined Grovelling indulgences, in a dim halo Of sacred radiance see those shapes enshrined Which speak of other days, and friends long dead?— Whence, but from feeling, is such reverence fed, 27 That they the present with the past connect?— So much these instincts in some hearts preside, That forms which cannot by their aid be decked, Whate'er their worth, whate'er their costly pride, From them can challenge nothing but neglect: Yet, on the other hand, have they descried The meanest utensil a parent used, With what intense delight is it perused!— 28 Some see in forms little to challenge praise, Save as they're mute interpreters of love: Thence many, without doubt, may wildly raise A superstitious structure, which would prove Fatal to nobler aims: since where their gaze Was thus allured, they never would remove Their thoughts to abstract themes:—such influences, Changed Christ's pure laws to It need be scarcely here said, that in these lines we refer to the Roman Catholic rites; in which, by means of pictures, statues, censers, perfumes, music, and architectural ornament, there is an attempt made as it were to excite the feelings through the iustrumentality of sensuous symbols—in which, truths the most abs'ract, are, as it were, embodied, and the very mysteries of religion typified by means of physical hieroglyphics.—This religion certainly tends to the consecration of sensible objects, but to secure this end, does it not lower the sublimity of immaterial ones?purveyors for the senses. 29 But still subordinate to nobler things, Just in proportion will such instinct dwell In souls, as they possess that power which flings O'er lifeless forms a consecrating spell!— Without the fire, which, from such instinct springs, Like seedless husk, and unallotted shell Were all life's objects! What were scents, forms, hues, Did moral feeling not her aid infuse? 30 The more, in all respects, mere form is merged In moral feeling, more is spiritualized The sentiment with which mute shapes are charged, Less are they likely to be idolized By physical attachment, more enlarged Will they from “th' entire point” Love is not love, When it is mingled with regards that stand Aloof from th'entire point. Shakspeare. be enfranchised: The more we love form's accidents, the less On their base bullion shall we lay a stress. 31 We say the finest soul (but mind we say This only when nought else doth interfere Of higher pressure) will the most array Mute forms with an ideal atmosphere, Which gives them to the heart a moral sway!— There are we know of stoic mood severe, Who superstitious such devotion deem!— The muse is not for them whate'er her theme! 32 This is a natural instinct. Homer read Or Virgil; how do they with care describe The helmet, shield, or trappings of the steed Belonging to the chief of each bold tribe? With what strong eloquence did Ajax plead, What elocution did the chiefs imbibe,— Convened to award the arms,—from that fine strain, Whence Ithacus, Pelides' arms did gain! The Author is quite aware that the orations in Ovid to which he refers are fictitious, but they have in them all that is necessary to poetical truth, as nothing is expressed in them which might not have flowed from the lips of the characters to whom they are imputed. 33 Is there a goblet, or a tripod named, Is there a belt, a dart, or quiver sung, Nor him by whom 'twas given, first proclaimed? Rather such sanctity in those times clung To these mute symbols, and so much inflamed Were their rude honest hearts when records rung In old traditionary tales of these;— Their bards immortalized their blazonries. 34 Achilles' shield, who does not recollect?

He threw them from him in a fit of insanity. Zerbino found them, and hung them, as a trophy, on the branches of a tree. Mandricardo seized them, and while wearing them was slain by Rogero. Orlando, till, love's wretched thrall, His sense forsook him; and which did in vain Defend the Paynim by Rogero slain. 35 Ah, who would wish to be the man that could— To modernize his ancestral demesne, To introduce that gorgeous brotherhood Of trees, lawn, water, in his household scene Which modern taste demands,—where erst there stood An ancient vista, venerable skreen To his forefather's mansion,—level all, Oak, ash, and elm, and triumph in their fall? 36 'Tis fitting to consult what is good taste When you original creator are Of household scenery: then may well be placed Forms in the abstract which are deemed most fair, But woe to him be, whose abode is graced With aught that brings imagination there, Fraught with the feeling of the mighty past, And mightier dead;—and who has this displaced? 37 Not all the ideal charms of Arcady, Not Tempe's vale, nor fam'd Sicilian bowers, Though by a wish they all could thither hie, Could e'er atone for outrage to those powers Of ancient feeling, and sublimity, Which he hath chased away! Exotic flowers Never can captivate that awful spirit Which did his thick tressed ivy bowers inherit. 38 Oh, whither hast thou led me, beauteous plant?— Yet lead me where thou wilt, I will go on!— My bounding heart receives, with grateful pant, The smallest touch of inspiration, From forms, e'en animation though they want!— Though still more warmly it perhaps might own A higher influence: I've elsewhere decreed, “ See “Desultory Thoughts in London,” opening of third book.Be the muse followed wheresoe'er she lead!” 39 And still I say it. Gorgeous plant and fair, My theme began with pointing out thy praise, Not only for thy beauty which so rare Is, that it well a grateful song might raise; But, for the power thou hast,—on charms that were By me enjoyed,—again to make me gaze. And then, I liken'd thee in this my theme, In See stanza 13 of this poem. a dark path, to still recurring gleam. 40 I said, how sweet it is “from time to time,” Amid th' oblivious gulph that us surrounds, To see past forms reviving: when sublime In joy we are, how those of grief redound To our monition; and when being's prime Is whelmed in woe, from woes which have been crowned In their surcease, with comfort, to extract Hope, which the present woe might counteract. 41 I have proceeded to commemorate That lovely reconciling principle Which doth impart to forms inanimate A moral character,—that curious skill Which objects or from age doth consecrate, Or from the fact that they are symbols still Of hoar antiquity, and friends lov'd well!— Now, to this added, of them will I tell 42 How much more lov'd are they when they combine Thoughts of the past, or of great deeds of old, Or of departed friends, and also shrine Our youthful recollections in their cold, And hallowed blazonries? Who would not pine To see some heir-loom, which of past times told— Since of unwieldy size, or cumb'rous, 'twere,— Changed for some modern gew-gaw's tinsel glare? 43 Who does not recollect the glad exclaim Je donnerai de ces souvenirs un seul exemple, qui pourra faire juger de leur force, et de leur verite. Le premier jour que nous allames aux Charmettes, Maman 'etoit en chaise a porteurs, et je la suivois a pied. Le chemin monte; elle etoit assez pesante, et craignant de trop fatiguer sesporteurs, elle voulut descendre a peu pres a moitie chemin, pour faire le reste a pied. En marchant, elle vit quelque chose de bleu dans la haie, &amp; me dit, “voila de la pervenche encore en fleur.” Je n'avois jamais vu de la pervenche; je ne me baissai pas pour l' examiner: et j'ai la vue trop courte pour distinguer a terre les plantes de ma hauteur. Je jettois seulement en passant un coup d'oeil sur celle la, et pres de trente ans se sont passes sans que j'aie revu de la pervenche, ou que j'y aie fait attention. En 1764 etant a Cressier avec mon ami M. du Peyron, nous montions une petite montagne, au sommet de laquelle il y a un joli salon qu' il appelle avec raison Belle-vue Je commencois alors d'herboriser un peu. En montant, et regardant parmi les buissons, je pousse un cri de joie “ah, voila de la pervenche!” Et c'en etoit en effet. Du Peyron s'appercut du transport, mais il en ignorait la cause; ill'apprendra, je l'espere, lors qu'un jour il lira ceci.

And there my constant love was ever fixed. Thither when twilight its soft haze distils Would my thoughts fly, when with the distance mix'd Some little eminence my bosom thrills! Yes, when, from Barnwell, then my home, betwixt Th' horizon, and the nearer plain, I kenn'd Those fir-clad Gog and Magog hills.heights, heights loftier far ascend 51 Before my vision! Thus one little point Of similarity betwixt a scene We now inhabit, and a scene disjoint By many a tedious league, will with such keen, And efficacious agency, anoint The inward eye, that forms which intervene Will fade away, and from one small source thence, Pageants will rise of vast magnificence! 52 Whence is it that I—more than e'en I may Account for from their own intrinsic worth— Love birds and gardens, though in each the play Of nature's gladdening hand hath called to birth The beautiful and graceful? When a day Had more importance, than—in the drear dearth Of middle life—that which long years possess, I lov'd them!—Thence my present tenderness! 53 Can I a flower behold, nor call to mind How in my youthful garden plot I loved The self-same flower? How first its seed consigned To earth? and what an exstacy I proved When from the ground, in which it was enshrined, 'Twas at first visible? Scarce could be moved A mother's bosom more, when she surveyed Her darling's growth, than I, when aught betrayed 54 In this plant's progress to maturity Another stage! than did mine eyes devour Its coyly swelling buds, and—ecstacy Beyond all this!—its first consummate flower!— Scarce could a mother see with gladder eye Of puny nursling the recovered power After long ailing, then in drouthy tide, Drinking the shower, its glossy leaves I spied. 55 So with my little cagelings!

Who has no skill, from its most exquisite Display of loveliness, t' unseal the tomb Of many years departed? Who, if sight Be charmed, dreams not, that in its soft perfume There is a spiritual incense, which imparts Melodious sweetness to poetic hearts? 59 Yes, to a soul rich in imagination, Th' appliances to each particular sense Are intertwined in such rich combination, That each evolves the other's influence!— Thus hues well blended waken the sensation Derived from melody;—and sounds intense, And sweet, bring portraitures to gifted eyes! Thus strike one sense, and all will harmonize! 60 Thus delicate perfumes will steal within The very soul, and be like music there!— E'en lower senses, taste, and touch begin, By such a process, to acquire a rare, And unknown comprehensiveness!

The simplest meal where milk doth 'suage the thirst, And eggs, and herbs, the appetite, with art May be arranged so—witness many a theme— As fitly to adorn the poet's dream. 63 I ask of him, who has of Milton's hair That well sung See Foliage, by Leigh Hunt, pages 131, 132, 133. lock; I ask of every one, Who of that mulberry tree obtained a share Which has been hallowed to Fame's eldest son; I ask of every pilgrim, who would spare His last, last mite, some relic to have won; I challenge these, to prove, in human hearts, How deep the feeling is, which love imparts 64 T' inanimate objects when they're consecrate By holy recollections! when their forms, With ready instinct, we associate With fame that lifts us, or with love that warms: This is a fickle age, and soon, or late, We shall feel shame for these pestiferous swarms Of theories, which would, with vain pretence, Bring desecration to the things of sense! 65 My song is ended!

STANZAS ON THE DIFFICULTY WITH WHICH, IN YOUTH, WE BRING HOME TO OUR HABITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS, THE IDEA OF DEATH. We were, fair Queen, Two lads, that thought there was no more behind, But such a day to-morrow as to-day, And to be boy eternal. The Winter's Tale, act 1. scene 2. “Not childhood alone, but the young man till thirty, never feels practically that he is mortal. He knows it indeed, and if need were, he could preach a homily on the fragility of life; but he brings it not home to himself, any more than in a hot June, we can appropriate to our imagination the freezing days of December.”—Elia, Essays which have appeared under that signature in the London Magazine—New Year's Eve, p. 65. 1 I've heard it said, and true is the remark, That till thrice ten years o'er our beings steal, We think we are immortal: that the spark Within us, not like flash from smitten steel Which instantaneous darkness doth conceal, Is inextinguishable: yes, 'tis true, Till we experimentally do feel, By some home thrust, how easy to subdue Life, it eternal seems to our fallacious view. 2 I say not, should you ask a man though he Have not attained the age of thrice ten years, Whether he deem that he immortal be, That, with a rash “yes,” he should shock your ears, Nay, I deny not, that, a man who bears The stamp of intellect, though he have lived But lustres two twice told, may e'en draw tears By edifying homily, achieved To prove the human frame was ne'er from death reprieved. 3 There is an outline in our life's first stage, Certain familiar forms, familiar friends, And certain land-marks of our pilgrimage, To each of these our earliest instinct tends: And I aver till death rapacious rends These pillars of our being, till we learn To feel that sense of fluctuation blends With all towards which in childhood we did yearn, To recognize our mutability we spurn. 4 So long as these “familiar faces” last, So long as in our childhood's home we dwell, So long as of two generations past, Grandsire, and sire, the honoured beacons, tell, Of outposts to our being's citadel, That should, according to the likeliest chance, Lapsing themselves, our latest lapse foretel, So long at death we cast incredulous glance, Or dream of it as of an insubstantial trance. 5 Besides there is a time, in early youth, When in ourselves we wholly live, when we Ascribe pre-eminence of actual truth, Pre-eminently give reality To our own sphere of life—until we see Things change around us, till our friends fall down Plucked by the hand of death, as from a tree The leaves of autumn, till we make our own The experience of the past from losses we have known; 6 We think that all, save that which we behold, Unreal is:—our ancestors, when they To us are mentioned, as a tale that's told, Pass through our memories.—With a proud survey, We think the point in which we live alway Will be the actual present.—Time doth tell A different lesson; mouldering into clay Friend after friend we see, and every knell Some past illusion scares, some future hope doth quell. 7 We say not, that herein there may not be Many exceptions. 'Tis the general rule Which here we do record. Mortality So early may have trained us in his school, So soon, or ere life's salient spark did cool, Our parents, from our grasp, may have been torn, So soon we have been “ But now, they rise again With twenty mortal murders on their crowns, And push us from our stools. Macbeih, act 3d, scene 4th.pushed” as “from the stool” Of life's brief empire, that bereft, forlorn, Life, ere our life matured, may of its hope be shorn. 8 Religion too, by providential voice, May have, so early, trained us in her lore:— Truth may, so soon, have shewn the wiser choice Which the devoted Mary made of yore;— Have drawn us, spite of all earth had in store, “To th' better cause,” that we, quite exorcised, May, from our earliest years, have given o'er All mortal strife, and nothing else have prized Save that “pearl” for which all is cheaply sacrificed. 9 But, in the common way, we seldom think Of death, till death not only hath mowed down Our dearest friends; but till our hopes too shrink, Torn from us, as hereditary crown From abdicated King; till fortune frown, And snap life's tenderest thread, we cast a glance, Of change unapprehensive, up and down, And quite absorbed in insubstantial trance, Think to behold, in life, an unchanged countenance. 10 We seldom think of death till thirty years Have somewhat cooled our blood, and quenched our thirst, And hunger, for that bliss, which no one fears To miss, and which when life's gay prospects first Open upon us, on our gaze doth burst In shapes so Proteus like. But from that time This thought with every form is interspersed, Like note of discord, or imperfect rhyme, Spoiling harmonious sounds, or poesy's sweet chime. 11 'Till life's first scenes have undergone a change, 'Till of old objects it have once been cleared, And others have arisen in that range Of observation, 'specially endeared To earliest sympathies; till the all-feared, And silent despot, Death, have taken aim Against some bulwarks of our hearts which reared, Like Babel's tower, their venerated frame, Beneath whose shade we thought that danger never came; 12 'Till old things vanish, and till new ones rise, 'Till in our childhood's home we look in vain For the kind greeting of those well-known eyes Which did of our's the firstling glances chain; 'Till we have quitted childhood's sheltered plain, And gained the summit of maturity, 'Till that horizon fate did first ordain To bound our sight, doth sink away, and die, And new ones, at each stage, rise to our mental eye; 13 'Till these things be, the sense of permanence Dwells with our being, and though we, if asked If we immortal were, with eloquence Might prove our own mortality; yet masked— So long as in the morn-beam we have basked Of earlier life,—so much is death's grim face, Oh, 'tis a blest time wheu we hold beneath The heart, such lavish hoards of joy sincere, They e'en with sweetness pall 'till pungent made by fear. See Desultory Thoughts in London, and other Poems, p. 237, stan. 30.That, o'erinformed with happiness, o'ertasked With taste of bliss, it yields a pungent grace, A savour of sweet fear his antic feats to trace. 14 We see him then but as in masquerade, He comes but as the wizard of life's tale, But different far the case is when displayed, Before our vision are his banners pale; When near the dwelling of our youth, the gale Which passes by, is tainted with his breath; Then his imaginary trophies fail, And we no longer list with indrawn breath, Or hear with pleasing awe the chronicles of death. 15 That which before excited, now appals; That which before did stimulate, doth quell; That which before did thrill, not dully falls On us, with leaden weight, like palsying spell!— Life, thou hast lost, that, without which, the cell Of fancy, no more teems with magic charms, Sense of security! and those know well Who this experience gain of death's alarms, All is then lost except Religion ope her arms. 16 Yes, there's a tide in life, in hope's fresh hues When all is bathed; a time when we not yet Have shaken hands with fear: when joy endues, And bold aspiring promises (the debt Not being yet drawn out, which, soon or late, Will stare us in the face we have to pay To pain, to sin, and man's degraded state) The splendid future; and while on our way Illusion still doth chaunt her necromantic lay. 17 That time soon closes! And, ah! woe to him, When it has closed, who's not so wisely sown, That he may sing no spiritual harvest hymn; Nor with such foresight planted as to own Interest in heaven's own garner; never known Blighted to be or barren, from the store Filled of celestial seed. East winds have blown In vain, and mildew sought its bane to pour On that celestial hoard, sound even to the core. 18 We do not say, when on the term we fix Of thirty years, for death's dire revelation, When we contend that it doth never mix With all our thoughts till on the middle station Of life we gain prospective elevation More distant objects to descry than those Familiar ones, which moulded young sensation, That many chances may not interpose, That mood to antedate which from death's knowledge flows. 19 A parent, brother, sister, or a friend, Tenderly loved, snatched from us in the bloom Of life, perchance sooner the veil may rend, Which hides from youthful eyes the yawning tomb. But yet though this should chance, it is our doom So full of joy, so full of hope to be, Mainly in life's first stages, that though gloom Be in the outline of our destiny It leaves our untouched spirits unimpaired and free, 20 Like water lapsing o'er a glossy woof With unctuous juice impregnate. Whensoe'er This sense brought home of death, this heartfelt proof Of our mortality becomes our share, If we have not religion, deep despair Will seize upon our spirits, but if we Possess that blessed gift, joy shall they wear, As fades all life's substantiality, Th' unreal earth is lost in heaven's reality. STANZAS INTENDED AS A REPLY TO, AND A COMMENT ON, THE FOLLOWING LINES. OH would I not, the pulse of love to waken E'en in a being by the world rejected, Stoop to compliances the least connected With aught could flatter self? Ah, was not this What of himself, when he himself depicted, Frankly confessed the paradox-loving Swiss “To meet a second self is the sublime of bliss?” Ah, was not this my wish? My hope supreme? Cannot a being, or in earth, or heaven, Be met with,—from the stigma of a dream,— To rescue him, who has with much toil, striven For such communion? Like a spirit driven From comprehension by connatural things I, from the extremest ardour, ever given To man, for human sympathy, my wings Now flag, and glad would be to drink lethean springs. See Nugœ Canora, Stanzas by C. Lloyd, part of 8th and 9th stanza. There are two ways in which we feel the home-thrusts of Religion, and they are diametrically opposite. The one from a cold-blooded indifference to the world; and the other from loving pleasure to such a degree, that no earthly pleasure can satisfy that love. The ascetic are generally composed either of the insensible, or those who have an excess of sensibility; of those for whom the world has no attractions, or those whom it attracts more than it can gratify. 1 Whenever I have turned to meaner themes, From thee Religion, so much more as I Have been enabled by warm-glowing gleams To give resplendence to their imagery, So much the more, of infidelity A sense has risen, in my conscious breast, Towards that, which I know well is worthily Alone, on the well govern'd mind impress'd, Towards that, whose joys alone no after stings molest. 2 Celestial Spirit which erewhile didst deign Our elder Milton's hallowed prayer to hear, Do thou inspire my tributary strain, Breathe thou through every word that sense severe Of Truth; and if aught eloquent appear, Let it to every one be manifest, That it flows from that empyrean clear, Where thou beside God's throne, a heavenly guest, With vision beatific evermore art blessed! 3 Long, long enough, have I on love enlarged, Wasting on idle theme my idle prime;— Not that I mean with folly may be charged Whate'er is not devotional in rhyme. But grant, that, from them shall result no crime, Yet human loves are vain, and end in air. Whereas that love which mounts on wings sublime Towards heaven, as everlastingly is fair, As sources whence it rose imperishable are. 4 The natural impulse, of each natural mind, Enough doth souls to natural passions move: We little need persuasives, whence inclined The human heart may be to human love. But does experience, towards religion, prove This natural bias, in the human heart? Rather doth not each stress tend to remove,— Each impulse both of nature and of art,— This noblest of all themes from man's immortal part? 5 'Twixt other attributes which man doth share This is the difference, and religious lore, That ere on its first rudiments he dare To cast an eye, e'en to its inmost core The heart must be renewed; no soul can soar To its most simple rules, till, on the wings Of the most holy Dove, it learn t'explore Truths, which, to those are, round whom this world clings, In heaven's own archives kept, unutterable things! 6 Father who gav'st me talents, 'tis my prayer, Since all unfit for bustling scenes I be, Since sequestration from those places, where Mankind, to grave affairs, most actively Is called, best suits my pensive tendency:— Do thou my humble aspiration bless, To bring a contribution tremblingly To that pure stock of truth, whose perfectness Best stays man's tottering steps through life's bleak wilderness. 7 Father! I ask, or in thy vineyard deign To let me be a labourer; to be But “in thy house” “a door-keeper!”—no strain Of mine shall then flow discontentedly. Oh deign to make me something; deign on me To shed th' anointing oil, that I may sing Loudly thy praises!—Or, if thy decree Claimant unfit deem me to touch the string Of thy most hallowed harp, hear my petitioning,— 8 I then implore that thou would'st fashion so My natural talents, that, with them, I may Become a labourer while here below, To lessen human sorrows!—Oh, I pray That I may be a something!—May the day, E'en of my pilgrimage, or ere it wane Behold a monument, whence men may say, “He, in his day, did his day's work!” Oh deign My lot to rescue from “unprofitable” stain! 9 Yet, if thy will be such, that neither I,— Or for “another and a better world,”— Must throw my mite in of utility;— Or e'en, in this, must see the flag unfurl'd Of active use;—if I must thus be hurl'd,— To keep me humble, from each high career, Whence man is hailed with blessings;—if I'm whirled Thus, from distinction's gratifying sphere:— Still moisten my pale cheek with gratitude's meek tear!— 10 Yes, let me never, never turn from thee!— Whether I be an instrument of use: Or whether I am bound to bend the knee In nothingness;—whether I can produce Aught of effect; or whether, thou, t'unloose, To unloose utterly, the mortal strings, Which bind me to this world, see'st fit, with noose, Hard as the gordian knot, to cramp my wings, And stamp me while I live, vilest of vilest things! 11 Yes, be thou “with me in the way I go!” Whether or poverty or wealth thou send;— Be thou my all in all! Be thee to know,— My heart's best treasure—as my soul's best friend! To touch unworthily, do thou forefend, With an unhallowed hand, that ark of thine!— What, what am I? Though in the dust I bend, Let me rejoice, that while I lowly pine, Thousands of purer souls in thy white raiment shine! 12 I've elsewhere said, “cannot in earth, or heaven, Being be found, from stigma of a dream To rescue him who hath with much toil striven For human sympathy?” Such the extreme Of folly, to expect, from turbid stream, To draw transparent waters, as to try In what is finite, what we still must deem Imperfect, stamped with mutability, There realized to find perfectibility! 13 No, no! There is but One, God is that one, Who all the soul's deep wants can satisfy; No, no! There is but One, that Being alone Who made the heart, who thoroughly can spy Its labyrinthine windings. We may try To find another self as well, may seek As soon to double our identity As hope on earth the blessing to bespeak Of perfect love in man, so faulty and so weak! 14 As it might easily be made appear A perfect sameness in the inner frame Of the mind's structure, in two beings here Would argue that their persons were the same— Though biform, two such beings would but claim Common identity. Therefore, I say, At such a consentaneousness to aim, Is, but in other words, to be the prey Of wishes fond as those which did Narcissus sway. 15 It is, in short, to wish a second self, Yet not a second self to find: it is The wish to find another, whom some elf, Versed in fantastic metamorphosis, Hath made so like us, that in him we miss Nought save entire identity. How fond Is it on such a dream to found our bliss! He who the finite ne'er can go beyond, Seeks happiness in vain, enthralled in error's bond! 16 To make this clear. If we but once allow (As most in present times admit) there dwells 'Twixt such and such a temperament (though how Causation here doth operate quite repels Man's finite guest) yet if the fact compels Our credence, that a given cast of mind, A given symmetry of form foretels, Then must we grant, that, if two forms enshrined Twokindred souls, they were to kindred forms assigned. 17 Now since two bodies never were the same, To seek two minds alike, vain is the quest: Alleviation is what we should claim, A soothing of the ills which life molest From human sympathy; but he whose breast Is fired with notion that he may discern Being through whom he may be wholly blest, Seeking for that which cannot be, will earn Nought but conviction sad how idly he did yearn. 18 Besides—but that 'tis foreign to our theme— It were not difficult the fact to prove That those most sympathy enjoy, whose stream Of thought, like twy-born founts, diversely move. We, those that are our opposites, most love; Where we're deficient, those who most abound; Those who're deficient where we soar above The common standard; if with candour crowned, And mutual comprehensiveness such tie be found. 19 In such a case a mutual aid is given;— One moral being of two counterparts Is formed; and thus each brings a leaven Whence each to t'other's scantiness imparts. But e'en in this, best tie of human hearts, Those imperfections which are still the bane Of all that is of man, with poisonous arts, Will interfere: no plant of earthly strain Did e'er yet grow mature, unblemished with a stain. 20 No, he who made the heart, can only know Its wants; he only who is infinite Can e'er appease th' unutterable throe, With which the soul doth pant for pure delight: He who while he doth perfectly requite That individual wish, can do as much, As for that individual, by his might, For every one whose heart doth own the touch Of grace, which leads it still from heaven its all to snatch. 21 Though man be finite, still his wishes are Indefinite, if not infinite: tell me then, Is there not an insuperable bar, 'Twixt finite beings rendering back again T' each other all they wish? As we are men We're with pure reason gifted. This doth tend To th' infinite. However we may strain All possibilities, when man doth blend With man, an aching void that union will attend. 22 No accidents of chance can hinder this; No possibilities of fate evade; Cease then the vain complaint of scanty bliss Attending human sympathy! By aid Of true philosophy is soon displayed Its impotence to satisfy the soul Athirst for living waters, Disarrayed Be man then of the captivating dole, Falsely to him ascribed, man's comfort to controul! 23 If thou have sensibility, a heart Impatient of th' imperfect joys of earth; If thou have vainly sought to play thy part, For blessings deemed here of most reverend worth; And if, like bubbles, thou have found their birth But harbinger'd their doom; how soon the stream Exhausted, which from this world gushes forth; If thou have found that joys from earth which teem, When once their taste is o'er, are joys but in a dream. 24 Remember still there's a resource for thee: If thou'rt a mystery to thyself, to all; Still to thy God thou art no mystery:— Yes, He, without whose care there doth not fall A sparrow to the ground, however small; Howe'er profound, how utterless soe'er Thy griefs, if thou on him with faith wilt call, Can bring a sure relief to thy despair; And raise elysian blooms where all seemed bleak and bare. 25 There cannot be a mood of mind so dim, So evanescent, imperceptible, But it is clear as noon of day to him; He sees thy rising cares or ere they fill Thine eyes with tears; and if with passive will Thou at his foot-stool meekly wilt fall down The tumult of thy anguish he will still, And all the contrite tears thy cheek which drown Will add a living gem to faith's immortal crown. 26 So far with tolerance th' instinct do I see Which leads the spirit with devotion fond, To seek in youth for perfect sympathy In other human hearts, that few this bond Who have not sought, few who have never conned With weak idolatry, a human face, And found how vain were human loves; beyond Were everled to go: triumphs of grace Are oftenest gained by souls driven from love's earthly race. 27 The principle of love must be implanted, Or e'en divine love ne'er will take its root: Small hope for those who're of this instinct scanted: Small hope for those involved in low pursuit Of interest or ambition! Who with brute, And earthward gaze see nought beyond themselves: But hope, ye mourners, who with anguish mute, See each foundation, like a train of elves, Vanish, which human skill unprofitably delves. 28 As to Religion's cause, one well might hope, Rather to gain th' idolater, than one Who loves in atheistic gloom to mope:— So may we rather hope he may be won To love his God, him whom the fervid sun Of love hath fevered, whose still earnest eye Some outward idol still is fixed upon, Than him in self-involved captivity, Who thinks he's free since self doth doom his slavery. 29 Passion, love, adoration! Fine the links That in progressive process join these three, Cursed is that soul, which gifted, basely sinks From last of these to that first named! So he, Who is so wise, if he defeated be In passion, and in love, to raise his thought In adoration, from th' idolatry Of passion, and of love, will soon be taught That superhuman bliss is by the latter brought. 30 “There is a bliss the eye hath never seen, “There is a bliss the ear hath never heard, “Nor hath it ever comprehended been:— “And though on man's heart 'tis sometimes conferred,” Never except on him whose heart is stirred With spiritual communion: he who drinks Of that immortal fount, to him preferred Is that pure peace, which while it deeply sinks Into our heart of hearts, speech from its utterance shrinks. 31 Oh God, give me, and I will never crave An earthly joy, that peace which passeth words; That peace whose smile can hover o'er the grave, That peace whose inner wealth can shame all hoards Of bliss terrestrial; that peace which affords Pity to other's sorrow; and which feels, E'en while it braves the edge of hostile swords, And binds all human wounds, and while it kneels E'en by the bed of death, a blessedness which heals. 32 Yes, I rejoice in spirit, when I think On this tried panacea: 'tis a balm Which to the depth of deepest wounds may sink, Which the most troubled soul may quickly calm. Ask it of God then, ask it! 'Tis an alm He freely doth vouchsafe: but oh, how rare The privilege to sing a grateful psalm For its bequest, save by those, who, in prayer, Bankrupt in earthly hope, turn heavenward in despair!— 33 Yes, could I wish for others or myself; It were, that, pierced the veil 'twixt thee and me, My God, I, sacrificing earthly pelf, Might view, as the supreme reality, Thee, and the world of spirits. Who that's free Would wish to be imprison'd? Who that could Carry his thoughts to all eternity, In glad progression, forward, would be mewed In seventy years brief space of ailing flesh and blood? 34 But how shall this be gained? By fervent prayer— “In season, out of season, in prayer” “be “Instant,” th' Apostle saith. First station there— In yon bright mansion of eternity, Thy heart's chief loves, and thou wilt quickly see, With spiritual eye, far clearer than on earth, To the natural eye—with more reality— Than to that eye those forms which here have birth, Objects surpassing man's weak powers to body forth! 35 I talk not of ecstatic vision!—no:— Nor of conversion instantaneous speak: Few, few gain such immunity below, From thrall of flesh and blood, save him whose cheek Contrition oft hath dewed with tear-drops meek: 'Tis a slow process in most hearts, to wean Them so from this world's coil, that on them break, With all the freshness of a real scene, Those glories hid behind mortality's dim skreen. 36 Be humble,—be resigned,—be penitent:— Be God's thy will:—the spirit of prayer be thine; The spirit of love: be with each chance content That seems to fall out in th' appointed line Of Providence. Let not thy soul repine, Nor yield it e'er to fruitless retrospect. Save when thou feel'st admonished from the shrine Of awful conscience, that, by some neglect Of thine, thou pay'st the fine for God's will by thee checked. 37 In God thou liv'st, thou mov'st, thy being hast; Bring this truth home to constant consciousness; About thy bed, about thy path, is placed The angel of his presence. Dost thou press Thy bed down-lying; rising, doth the stress Of the day's duties crowd upon thy thought; Still ever in adoring awfulness Be, to thy spirit, the reflection brought, That wheresoe'er thou art, is with his presence fraught. LINES WRITTEN FEB. 6, 1822, ON THE DEATH OF MARY LLOYD, MOTHER OF THE AUTHOR. My dearest Mother, could a lay of mine Rescue thy memory from oblivion's gloom, How gladly would my efforts try to build Th' imperishable verse; for thou wert one Deserving well the love of those that knew thee. Pious thou wert, sincere, and elevate Above all vulgar thought: thy heart, the seat Of every finer sensibility, Was not for this world's ways. How well do I Remember, when I yet was but a boy, And only knew of death by name: ne'er yet Had felt the nearest interests of my heart Rent by its cold inexorable hand; How well do I still recollect the beam That brightened in thine eye, and o'er thy face Spread like a glory, when some lovely scene Of nature called on thee to gaze; or when In book which thou perusedst thou did meet With sympathetic sentiment, from strain Lofty, impassioned, generous, or devout. How well do I remember when on eve Of summer, thou didst sit, and watch the sun's Last radiance, watch the simple landscape seen From nether windows of thy then abode, With houses otherwise encompassed, how Do I remember what serenity, Bespeaking solemn and unearthly thoughts, Brooded on all thy person! How thou lookedst Still I recall to mind, and too recall How oft such hour by some appropriate strain From the Seasons' bard, and him of flight more lofty, The Poet who did tune his sacred harp To tell of man's first innocence, his fall, And restoration,—how such hour was filled By some appropriate strain from these with taste Selected;—thy enunciation graced Each apt quotation: for thy countenance, Each gesture, tone of voice, an earnest gave, Thou lentest more of feeling to the strain By thee recited, than thou drew'st from thence. Thou wert meet Priestess for an hour like this! Thine was a breast tuned to each holier thought! Thine was a voice which e'en an angel might Have made its organ, in discourse with man Rendering thee his interpretress! so free From aught of vulgar, sordid, mean, or low, Were all thy feelings, that not only thou Didst never to a mood which these inspire Give utterance, but also in thy breast Instinct connatural to such impulses Could not be found! Thou hadst a fiery spirit, But yet of fire celestial! and the flame Thou inly nursedst, like a vestal light Diffused its radiance round thy daily path, Shone in thy countenance, purified thy words From all alloy terrestrial: (never thought By this world's dross adulterate dimmed their brightness) Pure was thy love as that which we conceive Souls disembodied feel for spirits purged From all material sediment. Thou art gone! The scene in which thou movedst now is filled By other objects. No more doth thy keen, And searching spirit, o'er the haunts preside, Where to thy friends thy form was once familiar! Thus do the generations pass away! And nought is left of those we most did love, Most cherished, and most reverenced, those who most Endeared to us our span of life below, But their remembrance living in our hearts. So will it ere long fare with him who now Indites this frail memorial. Ah, were life, So brittle are its best of gifts, worth having, Were there not hope that every struggle here Will yet be recognized! Each tear we shed Of sorrow, or contrition, yet recalled, And with a crown rewarded! There's a voice Which tells us that supreme reality Is not in things of sense! They who have felt Their spirits lifted by the power of prayer, These, these can tell that power doth with it bring Secret assurance of its genuine worth! What causes us when we are told of those Whose robes are whitened in their Saviour's blood, Of those who have as conquerors come forth From many tribulations, what doth cause That secret earnestness the spirit feels To be of that blest number? Why, if things Of sense were doomed to be our chiefest good, Do things of sense ne'er satisfy the soul, Do things of sense ne'er satisfy the soul, And vaguest promises of Gospel joy, Bring greater confirmation to the spirit Wrestling with passions, and with tempting baits Of speciousest allurement, than all things The world can give? Why do we find our life, Then when we lose it, most? Or whence arise The stubborn facts, that having sacrificed The bulkiest treasures of this bustling world, For things not only here invisible, But also oft but half imagined, we Feel a deep calm that tells us we are wise? It is that there is truth in virtue's hopes! Let a man have not only all this world Can give externally, but let him too Have all internal powers adapted best To most voluptuous pleasures of existence, Still will his joys, like motes before the eye On a warm summer's day, suddenly vanish; Fall from him like the dim imaginings Of half-remembered dreams, and like a corse, Cold and inanimate,—and worse than this,— E'en like a culprit caught in act of guilt, Appalled, surprised, convicted, smote with shame, Leave him a statue of mute wonderment! Do virtue's promises deceive us thus?— Do they forsake us when we want them most? Do they fly from us, like unfaithful friends From a sick comrade, or from death-bed scene? When we most want reality, are they Not then most real found? They may indeed By turbulent pleasures of this bustling world Be scared away: but not like parasites, They best bested us when we need them most! Like worldly men, the pleasures of this world Add confluence but to confluence! But the joys Derived from virtue live in solitude: Comfort e'en indigence, where lack of friends Is most regretted, there they most repair, O'er pain they triumph, and defy e'en death! My Mother, thou hadst well these truths discerned! Though blest with sense, and polished manners, thou E'en in the flower of youth didst wisely turn From all the proffered flatteries of life, And seeking that within, which other's seek Without, thou addedst to the Confessors By whom the ways of truth are justified! Thine own example furnishing best proof That e'en in sickness (for thou sufferedst much From this the greatest enemy to joy, Save that which doth assail the sons of guilt) That e'en in sickness, there may be discovered A never-failing balm. Though there in thee Was found that sensibility which oft Exaggerates life's joys, in thee it brought Its own redress. For while it haply raised The smothered sigh for more than common bliss, That delicacy hence thy soul imbibed, Forbade all earthly bliss to satisfy Its most importunate cravings.— My weak art Is all inadequate to draw thee forth From death's oblivious gloom; thee to pourtray As thou wert seen, and known, and felt to be. But never, never can my heart forget The influence of thy presence! I am proud Now to reflect I was with mother blest, Who although she was with humility Clad as a daily garb, never betrayed, In thought, or word, or action, any impulse Not fittted for the universe to witness. Thou wert by nature eminently blessed With powers of nice discrimination. Thou Couldst see at once through veil the most opaque Hypocrisy assumed. Thou wert not soon Duped by professions. Flattery thou didst hate. To thee the best of flatteries was to be Unflattering; thy best homage, sympathy. Thy sense of nice propriety extended From things to persons. Thou didst always call Forth others latent powers: didst evermore Thyself forget in company with others. The rites of hospitality thou ne'er Neglectedst: to thy table, to thy roof, None came unwelcome, whatsoe'er the hour,— Thy mood,—thy pressures of anxiety,— And I have heard it said by Him who best Knew thy life's tenor, that he never saw thee, Save with a smile of kindly courteous welcome, Greet e'en the guest the most inopportune: And best of introductions to thy notice, Was it to feel that notice might give joy,— Do good,—at least some sorrow mitigate! Not like the worldling who doth ever seek The flux of company, thou chiefly turnedst Thy kind attention where it most could find A heart whose desolation it might gladden. In thee a perfectly decorous bearing Was not, like garb of state, put on alone For festal days; an emanation 'twas From a still cleaving sense most exquisite, Most unremitting, of propriety. And those who saw thee might perhaps at first, More than by love, be, by respect, impressed: Provided that, if they discriminate powers Possessed, they had not soon discovered thou Beneath this veil of nice propriety Conceal'dst a heart where tenderest feelings dwelt: 'Twas not because she felt not, 'twas because Her feelings were too lofty for this world, It was because that she, to those she loved Could give perchance more than they could return, And that a secret intimating instinct This truth suggested, perhaps not self-confessed From her abundant lowliness of heart, 'Twas hence the panoply of circumspection Did so conspicuously guard her life, That to the superficial she might seem Reserved, unbending, rigid, and austere!— But no, let those who as a mother saw thee When thou hadst babes that asked a mother's care, Let those who saw thee when the poor did plead, Let those who saw thee when an o'ercharged heart Gave to the tongue the utterance it needed, To pour its secret sorrows to thy ears,— Let these say how thou feltest! Though thyself Not only wert from every stain exempt, But that not e'en the most pestiferous breath Of most deliberate malevolence Could ever in thy conduct find a flaw, Yet thou wert ever ready to discern Some palliative for frailties of mankind. In thee the fallen, not a censurer Found, but a sorrowing, sympathetic friend! Grief, came she even in the garb of vice, To thee was sacred; and if charity May indeed cover multitude of sins, What may not then be said of it when borne— (Not as antagonist weight so to eke out Our own slack worthiness)—by one like thee, Exempted from all need (as men wear masks) With one compensatory grace to hide A thousand failings? No, in thee it was A fresh, gratuitous, and healthful spring Like that of living waters: not squeezed out, A most equivocal distilment, drawn, (By process as elaborate as those Of antique chemistry) from neighbouring vices! Thine was no maudling, whimpering charity! It was the charity of one whose breast, Rich in its own creations, owed to these A consciousness of all man's heart can feel; In that warm bosom there did dwell enshrined A human microcosm, which reflected All the mind's accidents; and though in her Each impulse not consistent with true worth, If it had e'er had birth, had been repressed, This opulence of nature, this rich gift Of human intuitions, qualified— (As mariners assisted by a compass May unknown seas explore)—her to extend E'en to the obscurest regions of the mind, To all those passions which command our tears, To all those impulses which would be voiceless Had they not correspondent sighs and groans, A quick discernment, and a sympathy Which almost did anticipate the prayer Labouring for utterance in an aching heart Desirous of her aid, to speak ashamed! STANZAS Written the 7th and 10th of February, ON THE DEATH OF MARY BRAITHWAITE, THE THIRD SISTER OF THE AUTHOR. 1 If innocence, and saint-like truth Persisted in from earliest youth, If passiveness so sweet, In her so patient was, it might, If praise it sought, that praise excite Which active virtues meet. 2 If all that marks the christian here, The soul devout, the ready tear, For every child of woe; If these, dear Mary, might require The votive lay, well from my lyre The elegy may flow. 3 The tender grace in thee enshrined, Thy patient gentleness of mind, Thy saint-like purity, Perfect exemption from each thought Of ill in others; thy untaught, And deep humility; 4 Thy tender care, in deed and word, That wrong should never be incurred From thee by any one: Thy habit all things to refer To the Almighty Arbiter, And Him to serve alone: 5 To those that knew thee, these might well Inspire the wish like thee t'excel In every christian grace: Thou liv'st in each of these enshrined; Each gains new strength, thee called to mind, To run the christian race. 6 Oh, what a fool were such as thou, Did no dread Being hear the vow Which those like thee profess, To die to every human hope, And give to no fond wish a scope, Save those which heaven may bless. 7 No wish hadst thou, but such as sprung From heaven! To its blest mansions clung All hopes which thee did rule: If vain those hopes, like hopes beneath, Then thou of every child of Eve Wert most indeed a fool! 8 But since in the dread human plan, No other instinct's given to man With purpose to confound, No end that cheers its appetence:— We may, with faith, infer from hence, Thou soughtedst, and hast found. 9 Say is it not a startling fact, Thousands are drawn the part to act Of dying, so to live! Or we must deem our life a lie, Or in such fact as this we spy A pledge that heaven will give. 10 From Heaven, a pledge, immortal life To give to those who to the strife Of duty nobly press: For as in other instincts, we, An end, by intuition, see, So faith can own no less. 11 But little, little can the world, Little those sons of men who're hurled In passion's ceaseless maze: Tell what the conflict is to those Who feel the food from heaven that flows Alone their want allays. 12 Oh, say ye, who have once drunk deep Of living waters; who must reap Immortally, or die, From sensuous joys how many fasts, How much toil your's long as life lasts, And inward agony! 13 How many tears ye shed alone! How many a sign ye heave unknown Which no one seems to hear! How many longings that your breast Might be like others, blessing, blest, Unfolded to no ear! 14 How many times, when nigh to faint, Ye fain would have the hard restraint, The austere interdict, Which severs you from things of sense, Repealed; and mockings which from hence Men of the world inflict. 15 How many times, when ye're gainsaid, When ye are scoffed, when all upbraid, Ye live in solitude! A solitude which few can tell; A solitude which those know well Whom heaven hath here renewed! 16 But bear ye up courageously! A day will come, a time will be When you in your turn shall, That you've been willing to be poor On earth, heaven's interest to secure, Triumphantly recall. 17 Not that we mean that what is done, So that thereby a prize be won, Can ever win that prize! No! we to all of self must die, Or ere supreme reality Is opened to our eyes. 18 We speak of consequence, not cause, Heaven comes from faith in heavenly laws, But comes alone to those Who, by a heavenly instinct led, Feel bound, though living, to be dead, To all the world bestows! 19 These drawn by love, and deemed as fools, Expedience calculating rules Will loyally disdain. They know that God doth love that mind, Acting in passive meekness, blind, Which love's pure laws constrain. 20 Oh Mary, thou, by such as these, Might'st well amid degenerate days Be as a pattern held! Thou said'st not much; professedst less; But thy whole life did best express What aim that life impelled! 21 In scenes domestic thou wert seen To most advantage: there serene Thy virtues knew no cloud: Not like our modern matrons, thou, With theories primed; in all the shew Of education proud! 22 Thou sattest like the brooding hen, Thy little ones round thee! No ken From thee did ever roam, Like as from those of baffled aim In prouder flatteries, to claim Divinity at home! 23 Love was thy ruling principle; Love that has neither wish, nor will, Save those which end in love: As others' praise thou ne'er hadst sought, Their praise or blame ne'er caused thy thought From love's calm sphere to rove. 24 Thou little wishedst child of thine In vain accomplishments to shine, Nor yet, with cynic tongue, Sought'st thou to check its growth, if chance Some genial exuberance In nature's order sprung. 25 All affectation thou didst hate: To be, not to appear: to wait In patience for the hour, Was thine, when thou, by choice of mood, Of time, and place, couldst call up good, Clothed from above with power! 26 Thou mov'dst in patience, and wert still In mind; seeking to work the will Of Him who rules above: Of Him who, to his little ones, Gives to repress earth's mightiest sons, With energy of love! 27 Yes; thou, in thy humility, Thy gentleness, simplicity, Might'st be an instance quoted, That God, the worldly to confound, Than strength more signally hath crowned, Weakness to him devoted. 28 By weakness here none can suspect Is meant deficient intellect; That lowliness we mean Which dare not move in its own will; That finds its strength in being still: In anguish is serene. 29 Though tender thou, and delicate, And, in thy youth, on thee did wait, To fallen flesh and blood, Those comforts which are most endeared; As one that all defilement feared, These were by thee withstood! 30 Why, if to render man the sport Of fate, is he thus taught to court E'en voluntary pain? Why see we not each brutish tribe The strange obliquity imbibe? From appetites refrain? 31 'Twould be as easy so to make Instinctively e'en brutes forsake That which they most desired, If this were but a play in Him Who rules the universal scheme, And for no end required. 32 By instinct thwarting instinct, so Brutes might the like confusion know As that of tongues in Babel, Were it, as sophists oft have written Men are with love of penance smitten, To be their Maker's fable. 33 Yes, if entire perplexity, And one grand universal lie Were that which heaven devised, Thus it might be! But no, 'tis proved That man by heaven is chiefly lov'd, Since man's alone “chastised.” 34 Yes, man—and man alone is left! The noblest of all creatures 'reft Alone, of powers to reap A satisfaction full, entire, From what as creatures men desire, To sleep, to feed,—and weep! 35 Man is the sole discordant thing; In man alone there jars a string Of endless discontent: He is, 'till influence from above Tune him to harmony of love, Like shattered instrument. 36 What, Mary, though thou'st early paid The debt to nature! All is said Which need our care engage, When 'tis pronounced, “thy task is done, And well!” and thou hast fairly won, By spotless But wisdom is the grey hair unto men, and an unspotted life old age.—Wisdom of Solomon, chap. 4, v. 9. life, old age! STANZAS TO ENNUI. Written February 13, 1823. Vous m'avez dit souvent, quand je me plaignois de l'ennui, qu'il etoit le malheur des gens heureux. Letters of Madame de Deffand to Lord Orford, vol. 3, p. 294. 1 Thou soul destroying fiend, I've heard It, by philosophers averred, That thou alone dost come, To visit with thy pale unrest The chambers of the human breast, Where too much happiness hath fixed its home. 2 I grant that thou dost chiefly reign O'er men, exempted from the train Of life's external woes; But hence 'twill never be allowed, By me, thy influence is bestowed Where with joys plethora the mind o'erflows. 3 Thou art, if I correctly can Read thy prognostic in each man Who by thy plague is cursed, The child of sensibility, Begot on cynic apathy, And art by selfish introversion nursed. 4 Too well I know thy gnawing power; Too long, have hour succeeding hour, Felt in my heart thy pest, Which roving yet unsatisfied, Languid, feels evermore denied, In every exigence, refreshing rest. 5 A ceaseless restlessness doth goad The wretch devoted to the load With which thou dost oppress The abject soul: which all things willeth, Yet nothing it can meet with stilleth Its keen, and yet fastidious, eagerness. 6 As wretch who tosseth on a bed, Where burning fever doth impede All postures ease to yield; So thou like Tantalus athirst With deepest impotence art cursed To grasp at that by which thou might'st be healed. 7 Thou turnest to the azure sky, And with a scrutinizing eye Dost ask of every birth Of nature, wont to fill with tears Thine eyes, what withers now and seres, The splendid firmament, the gorgeous earth. 8 'Tis passion is thy element, Its want, the secret, inly pent, Which conjures up thy hell:— Thy deep and deadly virulence Is only neutralised from hence:— Save in impassioned hearts didst thou e'er dwell? 9 Another and more venial cause Whence all the power in thee that gnaws Our vitals, and devours, Is it where those of active mind, To small circumference confined, Have scant external aims to vast internal powers. 10 Those who require love's genial heat To cause their pulse with health to beat, By dire fatality, These, these will be the reprobates On whom thy retribution waits, For every hour of past felicity. 11 It is a fact: we know not why A fact, but most assuredly One that experience proves, Where sensibility doth 'bide (To passion, that, we mean, allied) Seldom benevolence doth fix her loves. 12 Of human panaceas found, To mitigate thy festering wound, Benevolent desires Since teaching us, like genial elves In other's cause to lose ourselves, Most certainly appease its wasting fires. 13 We may be gentle, may be soft, May sensitively shrink as oft As we of sorrow hear, Yet not this sentimental trait, One moment from th' imperious sway Will exorcise our hearts of selfish fear. 14 'Tis from benevolence alone, Not sensibility, whence won Is ennui's disenthralment. Her soft conception of distress Is oft allied to helplessness, And shrinks from duty's uniform instalment. 15 But yet on t'other hand we may Affirm that those who bear the sway Meekly of passive woe, Who dare not move until they're led By him by whom the raven's fed, An insight most profound in duty's mysteries know. 16 Those who, by doing, always can Fill wisely up the little span Of life, to men assigned, These, as they ne'er can, the condition Know, of entire self-inanition, With its deep conflict ne'er can be refined. 17 Passion is man's sublimity By nature! Passion's mastery Religion's highest boast! But how that mind must be baptised, Till 'tis so fully exorcised, That all of grace is gained, since all of flesh is lost. 18 But waive we this.—When with a sigh We thought of thee, no homily Was in our breast arranged; We fain would paint thee as thou art, And try, since thou'lt not draw thy dart, By analyzing thee, to be avenged. 19 As 'tis a sane arbitrement, With vassal talents, which prevent All conflicts in sensation, That best thy influence evade;— So to thy pest all lends an aid When the sick will depends on stimulation. 20 When to the influence of thy curse We yield, thou of caprice art nurse, And all fastidiousness:— When we bend humbly 'neath the scourge Thou dost inexorably urge, Thy handmaid Patience comes at length to bless. 21 If borne with, (thou who most dost love Self-centred spirit to reprove) Of self-annihilation Thou art the teacher! If we nurse, By luxury, thy insidious curse, We forfeit finally, from thee, salvation. 22 Oh, when in youth, in all we see There's freshness, life, and novelty, And passion's conscience sleeps, Oh, what enlargement then we feel! Then no remorse with muttered spell Pursues our steps, and o'er our shoulder peeps! 23 Of every state by thee assailed, None are there, o'er which thou'st prevailed, Like thine, Satiety! Thence, Ennui, are the bloated slaves, Thence, as the Vampires spring from graves, All that vast train of minions waits on thee! 24 'Tis better far to wish in vain, Than not to have a wish t'unchain The fetters of the soul: 'Tis better far to feel a want, Than not to have a breath, a pant, Severing the stagnant clouds that round thee roll! 25 Of every state, the worst! in which No expectation doth enrich Monotony's blank mood! I'd rather writhe in pangs, than bear, Satiety's plethoric heir, A wishless state, o'ergorged with plenitude! 26 Oh Love! Thou art the sovereign good To man! We mean not here t'allude, By love, to amorous wiles, We mean by love, that plastic will, By which a human being still With other's interest his own beguiles. 27 Oh never freeze my heart, ye powers, That rule man's destiny! No flowers Can e'er his path adorn, Who with a cold self-centred heart, Ne'er lendeth out the smallest part Of that whence personal happiness is born. 28 Ne'er let my tears for others' woe Spontaneously cease to flow! Invoking charity, No cold exemption do I claim From ills that quench the vital flame, And Ennui's strongest spells do I defy! THE END.</field>
