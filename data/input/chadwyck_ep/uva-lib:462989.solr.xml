God the great geuer, of vertue and grace, Hath planted man here, but for a space: To liue and to learne, by his vocation, To serue God and man, by their ordination. To bye and to sel, accordyng to truth, Whether it be in age or in youth: Some for to trauayle, or to labour with tooles, And some al their lyfe, to studye in scooles. Some by diuinitie doeth honour attayne, To be chief of the clergye, in learnyng to raigne: And some to the law, as grace doeth them call, And some to good sciences, as most vnto fall. As I haue my chaunce now, a Marchaunt to bee, To al the whole world, to bond men and free: To credit or lend, from this day to that, To tale and retale, for money pit pat. To heare now my name, you wyl be glad, And that shal you know, both mery and sad: My name is truely, Diues Pragmaticus, A man rich and busy, with thynges Mundus. For stone, pearle, or gold, and al kyndes of ware, None vpon earth, with me can cumpare: Myne occupyeng is, by sea and by land, As you shall hereafter well vnderstand.

But false weightes and measures be execrable, And to the occupyers most dampnable: Also Usury and Simonie, be thynges as yll, And al that the people doeth powle and pyll. And as I haue heard tell by predication, That extorcion is as great abhomination: As all men doe know, as well as doe I, Whight from blacke, to lyue or to dy. Wherefore good reader, marke well in mynd, Who hath of me neede, as foloweth in kynd: And I neede of them, money to catch, Now come who that wyll, I haue to dispatch.

Thus to conclude, no further to clyme, With this mery Iest, and poore simple Ryme: For Seruauntes and Chyldren, to passe with the tyme, At conuenient leysure, no hurt it wyll be. Honest myrth in measure, is a pleasaunt thyng, To wryte and to rede well, be gyftes of learnyng: Remember this well, all you that be young, Exercise vertue, and rule well your toung. FINIS. (?)
