      <field name="fulltext">KENNETH AND FENELLA. A Legendary Tale. I In her strong Tow'r, in gloomy state, Rolling her dark eyes over Mearn, As far as sight its bounds discern, High-born Fenella, musing sat, II Lord Angus' Daughter: But that way, Not willingly, would Memory go, Since dreadful scenes of guilt and woe Forbad it, thitherward, to stray. III A Brother's murderâfell and foul! A Son who died by Justice' stroke; Firm as she was, her courage broke, And waken'd anguish in her soul! IV Widow'd and childless!âall her race, So pow'rful late, dispers'd or lost!â Thro' her torn heart, a fearful host Of images, each other chase. V Fair she had been, in beauty's prime; Still lofty were her port and look; But stormy passions often shook, And faded her, before her time. VI Scar'd by her glance, at distance stand, Trembling and mute, her menial Train, Observant, watch; and strive to gain Some respite from austere command. VII Of high endowment was her Mind, Practis'd in new and ancient lore; Daring, and desp'rate to explore Arts, all unfit for womankind. VIII Before her, open, lay a Book, On which, from time to time, her eye, With anxious curiosity, Cast an enquiring, ardent look. IX Sudden a ray of pleasure play'd About her features; like the light That glimmers through the gloom of night, And decorates its awful shade. X âCall the old Harper!ââat her word He's promptly call'd, and prompt appears. âMelvin!âmy Night of Sorrow wears âA milder hue:âRevenge deferr'd, XI âToo long! hath kept Fenella down: âBut now approaches fast the hour, âWhen those who wrong'd me shall devour âThe miseries that I have known. XII âThou hast thy lesson?âSoon shall come âThe moment, what I taught, to shewâ âBe to thy oath and duty true, âAnd peaceful, prosp'rous here, thy home!ââ XIII âLady! my fealty I know, âAnd plighted oath.âââ'Tis well!âretire!â She shut her Book, with eye on fire, And clear'd the cloud upon her brow. XIV Ah! Lady!âcast that Book away!â But half the truth its false Page tells: These wickedâthese enticing spells But win thy credence, to betray!â XV âGo!ââto her Vassal Train she said, âAnd bid them, quick, the Feast prepare: âLet every thing that's rich and rare, âUpon the sumptÃ¹ous board be spread! XVI âGorgeous!âBid all my Vassals wait, âAnd all my valiant Knights attend, âFor I expect a Royal Friend, âWho witness should, my highest state; XVII âWho witness shall, the joyful pride âMy Heart will feel, to greet him here. âO!ânever came a Guest so dear! âAs he shall feel, since Crath'link died. XVIII âAnd bid the Warder ope the Gate, âAnd raise the Bridge!âmy eager love âWould not a moment's hindrance prove, âNor make him, for a moment, wait. XIX âMy Velvet, Bracelets, Brooches bring! âMy Tire of Pearls, and Chains of Gold! âThink not my Charms feeble and old, âSince they can lure a mighty King!â XX In all her pomp and pride array'd, She hasted to her highest Tow'r, From whence her eager eyes devour The Country far and wide display'd. XXI To Hill she looked, and verdant Vale, To barren Heath and shady Wood; Look'd to the Rocks, and Carron's Flood; Till, rising on the distant gale, XXII Is heard the Hunter's cheering horn, And hallooings, and the Stag-Hounds' cry; Now faint, now full, now low, now high, As on the varying breezes borne. XXIII Upon the list'ning ear they gain, Till, from the Forest, dark and deep, And down the sunny Mountain's steep, They burst upon the neighb'ring Plain. XXIV Yet still the Roebuck far behind Leaves his Pursuers; swiftly flies To rocky wilds;âand fresh the cries Of Dogs and Hunters swell the wind. XXV More distant now they scour the glade, And, lessen'd to the eye, pursue, Till faint and fainter to the view, They sink into the silent shade. XXVI âThus cheated!ââvex'd Fenella cried;â âHow can my wonted tokens fail? âStill shall my labours nought avail, âAnd ev'ry art, in vain! be tried? XXVII âNew spells be sought:ââScarce had she spoke, When o'er the left-hand Mountain's brow, Some scatter'd Horsemen, moving slow, One, after one, appearing, broke. XXVIII As they descended to the Plain, Conspicuous, far above the rest, With loftier mien, and richer vest, A Warrior led the Vassal Train:â XXIX His Steed appear'd of gen'rous blood; But moving on, with limping pace, As harm'd in the impetÃ¹ous Chace, His mettle high, by pain subdu'd:â XXX 'Twas Royal Kenneth, dear to Fame; Nor ever, Scotland, hast thou known A braver Monarch on thy Throne, Nor one to worth, of higher claim. XXXI While following the nimble Roe, Which through the tangled Covert fled, A scatter'd thorn had lam'd his Steed, And made him, loth, the Chace forego. XXXII Fenella's Turrets, tow'ring high, Fit shelter for himself and Train, He saw, at distance, o'er the Plain, And saw them with delighted eye. XXXIII âGo to yon Castle-Gate!â he cries, To an attendant Knight, âand say âI mean to rest me on my way, âAnd taste its Hospitalities. XXXIV âAnd thou, my Page, to find my Son, âThrough wood, and glen, and mountain, hie! âCharge him, and all his Company, âTo join me, when the Chace is done.â XXXV But ere the Knight the bell could ring, An Herald, bravely suited, came, Entreating, from the noble Dame, To be presented to the King. XXXVI Arriv'dâand rev'rence duly paid, His Lady's message he address'd, Which pray'd his Majesty would rest And taste the cheer her duty made. XXXVII Onward they rodeâFenella hied, With full attendance, shew and state, To meet him at her Castle-Gate, With humble look, but inward pride. XXXVIII She would have kiss'd his royal hand, While bending low; but quickly rais'd, He kiss'd her cheek; and much he prais'd Her loyalty, and manners bland, XXXIX Her gallant Train, and stately Tow'rs, And noble mien; and gaily saidâ âLady, thy Guest has fairly sped, âTo seek refreshment in these bow'rs. XL â'Tis hard to say what pleases best.â âYes,âfairer is my Hostess found âThan all beside!âââAm I not bound,â Quick, she replied, âfor such a Guest, XLI âTo strain my means, and ope my heart? âAnd what those means may not supplyâ âTo compensate with courtesy? âMy King shall know, before we part, XLII âThe measure of his Servant's love:â âHow memorable!âhow blest the fate, âThat led him to Fenella's Gate, Kenneth, or much she errs, shall prove!â XLIII Flourish the trumpets;âevery bell Rings merrily;âthe Sewers ply Their utmost skill;âand merrily, Shoutings and songs the triumph tell.â XLIV Led by the King, the Lady came, And high and haughty was her port: Kenneth had never in his Court, So stately or superb a Dame. XLV Seated beside her Royal Guest, Her eyes she cast throughout the Hall, Dealing out courtesies to all; And oft she pledg'd him at the Feast. XLVI Their mingled Train, in ranks below, At the full Board, profusely fed, And quaff'd, and gib'd, as fancy led, With vacant heart and cheerful brow. XLVII âWould that Prince Malcolm, too, were here!â With lifted eye, Fenella said:â âI had a Son!âbut he is laid âCold in the Tomb!âMy King! what cheer? XLVIII âLet not the passing Shade of Grief, âThat rises in a Mother's breast, âBy Mem'ry goaded, mar the Feast! âIn gayer thoughts be found relief. XLIX âHarper!âa jovial Song begin!â A jovial Air the Harper sung: His praise resounds from ev'ry Tongue; And rises fresh, the mingled din L Of clatt'ring dishes, laughter loud, And hearty pledge, and vaunting brave; When, at a look Fenella gave, There seem'd to rise a sudden Cloud! LI The Lights grew dim! the Sponge, on flame, Burn'd purple in the Peacock's beak: His radiant tail and emerald neck, Gloomy, and indistinct became. LII The silken Banners round the head Of the wild Boar, a rustling make, As if their shafts a tempest shake, And, suddenly, are prostrate laid! LIII The Falcons scream!âthe Blood-Hound bays, With mane erect!âstrange Sounds are heard; Gaunt Shadows, flitting fast, appear'd; And Terror star'd on ev'ry face. LIV âLady!âwhat mean these Omens foul? âWhy is the lustre of the Feast âObscur'd before thy Royal Guest? âWhat purpose labours in thy Soul?â LV Fenella rose, without reply; The dark frown wander'd o'er her brow; Then nodding to the HarperââNow!â She turn'd, and said, with scowling eyeâ LVI âListen!ââFull Chords the Harper rung; His fingers fearful prelude made; Wildly he shook his hoary head, And thus, enthusiastic! sung:â LVII âThough long delay'd the destin'd Doom, âFor noble Blood unjustly shed, âUpon the hated Murd'rer's head âThe fatal Hour shall surely come! LVIII âWhere is the Chief? The Hero where? âWhose stately Presence grac'd this Hall? âWhat was his fate?âHow did he fall? âIn battled Ranks? In Combat fair? LIX âNo!âOn Lochaber's Sylvan Plain, âWhile warm and careless in the Chace, âWas seiz'd the bravest of his Race, âAnd lost his life at Dunsinane. LX âTears but too long have wail'd his Doom: âBlood calls for Blood!âthe pangs of Grief âShall never, never! know relief, âTill sinks his Murd'rer in the Tomb. LXI âListen! whose Conscience tells a tale, âResponsive to my warning Lay! âListen!âthen let that Conscience say, âIf tardy Vengeance, now, can fail!â LXII Up starts the King!ââFenella! speak! âWhat would this Harper's Song of Woe? âWhy does thy colour come, and go?â âWhat means thine eye? what means thy cheek?â LXIII âWhat means my cheek?âCan Kenneth ask!â Scoffing, Fenella made reply; âTo read the language in mine eye, âIs it for him so hard a task!â LXIV No more she said, but turn'd her round And wav'd her hand:âharsh discords rung; The curtain cross the wide Hall hung, Rose, heavy, at the horrid sound: LXV âLook!ââto the awe-struck King she cried, âBehind the tapestry appears âA glitt'ring row of threat'ning Spears, âBorne by grim Warriors, side by side: LXVI âAdvance!ââObedient to her word, Towards the Monarch, fierce they strode, Who, though surpris'd, collected stood, And wav'd on high, his trusty Sword. LXVII His faithful Servants, from the Hall, Ere they could seize their arms, and bring Defence and Rescue to their King, Were dragg'd to death, or bitter thrall. LXVIII âThy purpose, now, I ken too well!â He, sternly, to Fenella said:â âThy King, thy Guest, by guile betray'd! âThy Son for Murder, justly fell! LXIX âFor Cruthnet, murder'd by his hand!â Fierce, she replied;ââDost thou not know, âFor my Revenge he aim'd the blow, And pierc'd his Heart at my command? LXX âAnd shall the Soul whose fury wild, âEncourag'd Crath'link's vieful mood, âTo shed my only Brother's Blood, âFail to avenge my only Child! LXXI âStrike!âand strike home!ââTh'assassin Band Shook their sharp Spears, and gather'd round; But their bold Leader sudden found His Death, from Kenneth's mighty Hand. LXXII âFury! alike in Soul and Face, âNot unreveng'd thy King shall fall! âNor shall his Blood the festive Hall, âAnd festive Board, alone, disgrace!â LXXIII With savage speed, another Foe Urges his Spear at Kenneth's Side; But quickly flows the sanguine tide, From his own breast, who aim'd the blow. LXXIV The falling Ruffian's Spear he caught, And springing on th'abandon'd Board, Arm'd doubly with the Spear and Sword, He, thence, with more advantage fought. LXXV Another, and another, fall, Struck dead by his resistless Hand! His thund'ring Voiceâhis Eyeâcommand Terror and awe throughout the Hall,â LXXVI As, like another Mars, he stood, Fearless and fierce!âo'erturn'd around, The Gobletsâmix'd upon the ground The ruddy Wine, with streams of Blood. LXXVII Like Dogs at bay, who feel and fear The Royal Tyger's kindled rage, At wary distance, war they wage, And dart, in vain, the baffled Spear. LXXVIII âDastards!ââenrag'd Fenella cries,â âIs this your Valour?âThus your Lord âDo ye revenge!ââRous'd at the word, The place of Courage, Shame supplies. LXXIX One Villain aim'd a stunning Blow; As Kenneth reel'd, Fenella dire, With flashing Eye, and Soul on fire, Wrested a Spear, and laid him low. LXXX âBasely I fall!ââthe Monarch said, His Life-blood gushing from the Heart; Well has thy Treason play'd its part, âAnd heap'd dishonour on my Head. LXXXI âBut, short thy Triumph!âMalcolm soon, âShall sure, and dreadful Vengeance take!â He spoke and sunk.ââAnd let him wake âDeath and his Hell-hounds!ânow, my Son LXXXII âIn his untimely Grave shall rest! âHis Death reveng'd!âhis angry Ghost âAppeas'd, for Life and Honour lost, âBy this firm Hand, that gor'd thy Breast.â LXXXIII Scarce had she spoke, when sudden din Of clashing Armour reach'd her ear; And Sounds confus'd, and cries of Fear, Grow loud!âA Warrior hurries in, LXXXIV Bleeding and panting!ââAll is lost! âFly! Lady, fly!âno time for doubt! âFierce Malcolm comes, and hopeless Rout, âAnd Death, are on thy Castle's Host!â LXXXV âFenella fly!âYesâfly she must! âBut to return with Vengeance dread, âOn daring Malcolm's haughty head, âAnd lay the Stripling in the dust!â LXXXVI Frantic she spoke: her swelling Heart Indignant Scorn and Passions dire, Convuls'd; and burnt her Cheek with Ire, While Terrors from her Eye-Balls dart! LXXXVII Her Feet through secret portals hie, Spurning the very ground they trod: Fearless she seem'd of Man, or God, While forc'd, reluctantly, to fly!â LXXXVIII In rushes Malcolm:âLoud he criesâ âRescue my Father!ââbut too late To save him from a cruel fate; For while he speaks, his Father dies. LXXXIX The Prince, as struck by Light'ning, stood! For Kenneth stretch'd before him lay, Ghastly with wounds, and block'd the way, With Benches, Corses, Cates, and Blood! XC At such a Spectacle!âhis Tongue Refuses speech; his Art'ries beat; His Eyes were fix'd, and fix'd his Feet, As o'er his murder'd Sire he hung. XCI But starting from his torpor soon, Wild, he exclaimsââThe Fiend pursue! âLoose her own Blood-Hound, fleet and true! âMake his own Keeper urge him on! XCII âLift up the Royal Corse with care! âSee a fit Bier be quickly made, âThat to Icolmkil's sacred Shade, âThe sacred Relics I may bear. XCIII âSoon as the fell Fenella's found, âWithin her Castle's bloody Hall, âLet her endure a bitter thrall, âWhile Piles of Wood are heap'd around! XCIV âThen set this hated Hold on fire! âRemember! 'tis my firm Command, âThe Murd'ress find no helping Hand! âThere let her suffer!âthere expire!â XCV Prompt they depart: at dawn of day, The Body on the Bier is laid: With measur'd Step, and Music sad, The slow Procession takes its way. XCVI To far Icolmkil's lonely Isle The way it takes, where solemn Rite, 'Mid the illumin'd gloom of Night, Shall rest within the hallow'd Pile, XCVII All that remains of Scotland's King, So potent!âso rever'd of late! His Virtues and untimely Fate, Responsive Dirges, meetly, sing. XCVIII Meanwhile, the Blood-Hound eager sped, Urg'd by his Keeper's cheering tone, Scenting the path, though wild and lone, Through which his fiercer Mistress fled. XCIX He howl'd at times, and snuff'd the air, As near, and nearer still, he drew To a dark Cavern, where the Yew, And Holly, 'mid vast crags appear. C From rock to rock, stupendous height! An arching Bridge was lightly thrown O'er the dread chasm!âbut to look down, Confus'd the brain and dimm'd the sight. CI The dashing Waves, o'er fragments bare, Foam'd, bellowing, at the Cavern's mouth! A rugged Mound, of form uncouth, Seem'd to deny all access there. CII Yet there the Blood-Hound fiercer bay'd, Till on the very Billows' brink, The Scent he lost. But do not think For this, the keen Pursuers stay'd: CIII Over the steep and slipp'ry Mound They climb; explore the dank recess; Through gloom and splashing water press, And in its depths, Fenella found. CIV Yet, like the Leopard in her lair, Boiling with dauntless rage and pride, She, still, their menaces defied, And gather'd Courage from Despair. CV With Dagger arm'd, she firmly stood, And on the first that forward prest, Sprang furiously, and in his Breast, Bath'd deep its shining point in Blood. CVI âWorthy of Warriors, well,â she cried, âIs such Pursuit!âand such a War! âBut what Fenella's Arm can dare, âLearn, to abate your Vassal Pride!â CVII Of vast dimensions seem'd her Form, Seen indistinct; and lofty rose, Like fabled Fury to her Foes, That threatens in the howling Storm. CVIII They pause, appall'd!âbut Manhood, Shame, And sense of Follyâall conspire, To steel their Hearts, and rouse their Fire, And vindicate their Honour's claim. CIX O'erpow'r'd she falls:âbut Force, or Fear, Fenella's Courage cannot move. Captive, and bound, she cannot prove The Pangs that weaker Bosoms tear. CX âDastards!ââwith more than human cry, She thunders!ââfollow the command âOf him who basely arms your Hand âAgainst a Woman!âI defy CXI âYour Manacles!ânor can his Pow'r, âOr yours, recal the Moments fled! âNor raise, again, the silent Dead, âNor Kenneth's forfeit, Life, restore! CXII âBy me he fell!âexalted thought!â âHe fell by me!âExhaust your Rage!â âYour useless vengeance to assuage, âBe all your tort'ring Engines brought! CXIII âI scorn them all!ââNor from that hour, Could taunts or sufferings move her Tongue: She would not do her Spirit wrong, By wasting Words devoid of Pow'r. CXIV Borne to her Castle: In the Hall, Beside the slain Assassins plac'd, Firmly the Spectacle she fac'd, Nor seem'd its Horrors to appal. CXV Seem'd not; but Conscience 'midst Despair, Might, by God's Mercy! still aspire, And plead, amidst the blaze of fire, That soon consum'd her Body there. CXVI Such Scenes of old, through Plain and Wood, Of savage Spoil and ruthless Hate, Ravag'd, O! Kincardine! thy State, And stain'd thy festive Halls with Blood! CXVII Still, o'er Balbigno's cultur'd land, So fruitful now, of peaceful Bow'rs; The Ruins of Fenella's Tow'rs, Though shorn of all their Terrors, stand. CXVIII Nor Lauri'ston's strong Fortress rose, Nor Murphy's, with inferior pride; Nor Mather's Castles, far and wide, Envied, and dreaded by their Foes. CXIX Too oft, from these, the Bugle-Horn Sounded the Notes of Waste and Fear; And Bale-Fires shew'd the Peril near, Of Rapine, Rage, or Rancour born. CXX Majestic on its lofty Rock, Dunotter's Castle, awful! frown'd; The Guardian of the Country round, Nor daunted at the Battle's Shock. CXXI Vast and impregnable it stood, 'Midst frequent change and various chance; And mock'd the hostile Clans' advance, And heard, unmov'd, the raging Flood. CXXII Ev'n Kings, when foreign Foes were near, Or rebel Nobles shew'd their Hate, Their Sceptre, Crown, and Robes of State, Deposited, securely, here. CXXIII Forsaken!âsilent!ânow it lours; Save when the frighted Sea-Mew's cry, Wailing, proclaims the Tempest nigh, That rushes through its roofless Tow'rs. CXXIV Yet, still, pre-eminent in state, They struggle with the shock of Time, And shew how mighty in his prime, This Monarch of the Mountain sat. CXXV Long shall the Bridge of Gannochie, High-pois'd in air!âto whose dark Cave Fenella fled, the Tempest brave, And charm the wond'ring Trav'ller's eye. CXXVI Yet moreâfar moreâif moral sense Of Comfort, spread with lib'ral Hand; Of Plenty, smiling through the Land; Of wide and wise Benevolence: CXXVII If sense of these can touch his Heart, Far more the Traveller shall feel, The cultur'd Country's gen'ral Weal, Than all the grand Remains of Art! CXXVIII The Eagle's Eyrie, 'midst the wild, On some high cliff, impervious hung, Surprises!âBut the callow Young We cherish, of the Turtle mild. CXXIX Now undisturb'd by Civil War, The Cattle o'er thy Mountains roam; And Shepherds seek their humble Home, And eat their morsel, free from care,â CXXX Or climbing up the rugged Brow, To overlook their scatter'd Sheep, Repose upon the ruin'd Keep, Nor dread the Dungeon, deep below,â CXXXI Where lawless Clans, who liv'd by War, And fed on Plunder, hostile stood, Like Tygers thirsting, fierce, for blood, And thousands fell in feudal jar; CXXXII There, both Arbuthnots drew their Breath, So dear to Virtue, and the Muse! Monboddo's Talents there diffuse New riches o'er the mossy heath. CXXXIII See Gardenstone's unsparing Hand, The neat and busy Village raise: Through num'rous Looms the Shuttle plays, And Commerce thrives at his command. CXXXIV See Fettercairn, so barren late! Through Gordon's, Scott's, and Ramsay's care, Her Groves and Fields exhibit fair, And wonder at her alter'd state. CXXXV Hail! Barclayâdear to Man and God! Whose gen'rous, and enlighten'd Mind, Plans of Improvement first design'd, And Blessings left where'er he trod. CXXXVI O! Scotland!âLand of ev'ry scene That moves the heart or charms the eye; Long may thy gallant Sons apply Their Patriotism and Senses keen, CXXXVII To spread the Curtain deep, of Woods Over thy mountains!âdeck thy plains With Harvest full of golden grains, And draw Abundance from thy floods! CXXXVIII Long may thy Daughters' native Grace, Their cultur'd Minds, and Bosoms warm, And steady Virtue, know to charm And dignify thy future Race! CXXXIX United, still, with England's fate, And fighting, nobly! side by side, Still may ye humble Gallia's Pride, And still exalt Britannia's State! CXL Of equal Valour, equal Worth, May ye sustain a suff'ring World, Till from his Throne the Tyrant's hurl'd, That awes and desolates the Earth! CXLI Then from the Thames, and silver stream Of graceful Tweedâthe Trump of Fame, Shall, far and wide, your Pow'r proclaim, Of the whole Worldâthe Prop and Theme!</field>
