      <field name="fulltext">????? ?????? ???? ?? ???? ????? ???? ?????? ???? ???? ????? ????????, ??? ?? ???? ???? ????? ???? ??? ????? ???????? ?????????. —Lucian, Veræ Historiæ, lib. i. “Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy.”—Hamlet. KING POPPY NOTE. Throughout this book, the rubric running by the margin is to the text as a catalogue to a gallery of pictures. For when some painter has embodied in the images of a man and woman his conceptions of strength and beauty, then says the catalogue, ‘This is Mars, and that Venus;’ adding, perhaps, that the divinities so named are there represented in the persons of the King of France and the Queen of Navarre. As much, and indeed much more, is said by the picture itself. But the picture says it in one language, and the catalogue in another: and of those who interrogate the picture, some, it may be, would miss the answer to their question, did they not read it in the language of the catalogue. Yet neither can the catalogue tell them all they ask. PROLOGUE. LEGEND. Parent of unremember'd multitudes, Cui numen ademptum Oblivious Earth, whose immemorial youth, (Old Age's elder, and of burial born) Gone with the red leaf, with the green returns! Full many, mortals and immortals both, Coming and going hast thou seen, O Earth, That, gone, return not; and to thee no more As once they came shall come, with gifts divine Thy woods and streams and vales and hill-tops haunting, Those vanisht guests, the gods of other stars. There is a legend, the low-breathing wind When men were few upon the earth, they gave a glowing faith to many gods; but presently waxing many, they began to grudge cold credit even to the few gods left. Who then, departing, bore Faith back with them to Heaven: and men, missing Faith, invented Knowledge. All that Knowledge knew how to invent was doubt of everything by men invented. So that men's inventions endure but for a season; and, as they come, they go. Not so the leaves and blossoms that, going, come again. Whereby the divine beauty of the earth renews itself, and is forever. For the gifts of the gods outlast men's faith in the heavenly givers of them. And they, before they left it, clothed Earth's naked earthliness with starry flowers that, turning filth to fragrance, are sweeter than the flowerless stars. In Spring-time whispers to the trees and flowers, That some good gift on every flower and tree A guardian god or goddess once bestow'd. Pan made the reed melodious: Artemis With mystic influence fill'd the moonfern: Zeus The cypress, Cybelè the pine, endow'd With solemn grace: blithe Dionysus pour'd The strength of his indomitable mirth Into the sweet orbs of the cluster'd vine: Ethereal azure from Athenè's eyes] The dim veins of the violet imbued With pensive beauty: Cythereia's kiss Crimson'd the balmy bosom of the rose: Leaf of unfading lustre Phœbus gave To the green laurel: washt in Herè's milk, White shone the immaculate lily: and the ripe corn Demeter robed in Oriental gold. God-gifted thus, the rich earth's dusky breast Gleam'd, with innumerable hues adorn'd, As heaven's gay bow. But of all flowers that throng'd Here beginneth the Legend of the Poppy, which sheweth the true cause of the Rape of Proserpine. That undeserted garden of the gods The fairest deck'd Demeter's maiden child, In Enna blooming for Persephonè. Her, for the sake of her sweet dower, the lord Of barren Orcus in forced nuptials bore, A ravisht bride, to his abysmal home. But frustrate was the boisterous theft of Dis, To whose inhospitable realms transferr'd Her floral treasures perish'd—all save one, Of whose flowers only one remained alive in the Land of Death. And that one the least beautiful of all. A plain wild Poppy it was, of common kind, With cup faint-scented, and as pale in hue As the white bosom where it slept unseen When he in haste from Enna's bowery meads, And her scared maidens, snatch'd her. This shut flower In its delicious sanctuary escaped The suffocating pestilence that broods For ever above the Acherontian Fen, Fatal to mortals; and beneath her zone The virgin found, when she disrobed herself, Its snowy-petall'd blossom. 'Twas the last Of all things lovely in her life on earth The touch of Death had turn'd not into dust, And she would fain have saved it. But she knew That long unhurt in Death's morose domain It might not linger, nor returning pass The Stygian Ferry with Death's toll unpaid. Obscure and wavering, as the windy pines She consulteth Morpheus how she may best preserve its life. A midnight storm's convulsive glare reveals Thro' lurid gaps, along the halls of Hell Plutonian Princes bow'd their vassal heads In homage to Persephonè. With these Was one of softer aspect than the rest, Who, in the semblance of a sleeping child, On bat's wing borne came wafted from afar. Caressingly his little shoulder propp'd His pillow'd brow, with sallow hops encircled, And silent as the falling of the snow His flight he wing'd. To him her vext desire To save this living object of her love The goddess of the loved who live no more Confided. “Queen,” the Son of Hypnos said, “Eternal slumber hides from life's unrest, And death's undoing, those my wings enfold In sable silence.” “Tush!” the goddess cried, But dissatisfied with all his counsels; “Eternity of slumber, is that all Thou hast to offer one not yet awake? Keep for the weary thine unvalued boon, Or store it where, in mockery of them both, Delusive sculpture mimics life and death, Possessing neither.” Morpheus murmur'd, “Sleep Thou wilt not, and no other gift have I. But Lethè, the blind sister of my sire, Could give thy favourite Forgetfulness.” “For him,” she said, “'tis happiness preserved, Not happiness forgotten, that I crave. How shall I help, where hide, him? Whom invoke For his protection?” “Me!” a merry voice And giveth ear to the voice of Phantasos, the Founder of Romantic Art, Responded, sweet and sudden as the note Of an exultant skylark. Locks of light With blossoms girt, and dripping splendid dews, Flow'd from the radiant forehead of the boy, If boy it were, whose penetrative eyes Glow'd on Demeter's Daughter. Their regard Redden'd her white cheek, that beneath it burn'd Bright as the faded fire a breath revives In hueless ashes, as she answer'd, “Thou! Who art thou? Ganymede, or Love?” He smiled Mysteriously; and, answering in his stead, “Beware of him!” the God of Slumber sigh'd, “It is my madcap brother, Phantasos, Whose doings are an abomination to his brother, the Guardian of Classic Repose. The fairest of our kindred, and most false. Too calm for his quick essence, and too cold, Our classic clime; nor even to Hermes known That wild exuberant region of Romance His footstep, follow'd by the future, roams.” The Apparition, lightly turning, laugh'd, “Disloyal brother! Is it thus forsooth Of me thou speakest when awake? Go, sleep, Ungrateful one, and with a glad remorse Acknowledge my beneficence! The lean And hungry nights that in thy void abode Devour each other, for thy sake, I feed On fairer hours than all that dancing strew Roses and lilies round Aurora's car.” “Ay,” mutter'd Morpheus, “for thou paintest time Hence between the Classic and the Romantic, endless controversy. With truthless promise, and thy lies persuade Even darkness to mistake itself for light. Rashly I gave thee ill-requited leave To haunt my quiet kingdom. Fool'd by thee, Slumber is now the slave of thy deceits, And waking but a memory of lost joy.” Then to Persephonè once more, “Beware, 'Tis Phantasos!” he murmur'd sighingly. “Sole author he of those dumb dramas play'd In the fantastic theatres of Thought By puppet actors. For this God of Whims Within him hath what, otherwise employ'd, Might make him dangerous. His absurd designs Surpass the bound and order of the world, And ever doth he vaunt his power to build A world all boundless in a box of bone, Itself no bigger than a human skull.” Her drowsy monitor the goddess heard Unheedful, and to Phantasos appeal'd, Proserpine confides in Phantasos. “Fair stranger, if to thee such power belongs, O save this menaced remnant of the life That once was mine among the flowers of earth! For dear its little blossom is to me, As the lone babe that on her bosom smiles To a forsaken mother.” O'er her stoop'd The sleepless brother of the God of Sleep, With vans that heaved impatient to depart. “Child of Demeter, to my care confide This sleeping mortal!” he exclaim'd. “And thou, Mekon, the darling of Persephonè, Thine, for her sake, shall be a throne sublime, With endless rule above a boundless realm.” “Boundless!” she cried. “If such a realm there be, What is the unknown name of it?” He snatch'd By whom the Poppy is borne away The Poppy from her hesitating hand, Waved it in sportive scorn above the brows Of Morpheus, who was sleep-bound on the wing, And fled away, aërial kisses wafting From lips that, as he left her, whisper'd “Dream!” Deep in a wondrous world where heaven and earth Into Dreamland, Are mingled—where the living and the dead, United, from their mystic union bear Transcendent beings far as stars removed From all that lives and dies—a wondrous world Where yesterday, to-morrow, and to-day Are one day and the same—the Poppy breathed Enchanted air. And thro' its timeless noon, Continually o'er the fields of sleep Coming and going, as he came and went, Weird Phantasos, one finger at his lip, Husht commune with the white-robed dreamer held. But all he said was in a language lost, And taught the language of that land: Or learn'd not, by the wakeful and the wise. It was the language to midsummer woods In whispers utter'd by the evening wind; The language warbled in their roundelays By jubilant rivulets; and the nodding wheat And sighing barley in low undertones Its wordless tongue to one another lisp, Stirr'd by the gossip bee's incredible tidings Of deeds the Poppy in his dreams hath done. And still the Poppy dreams; and, dreaming still, A land of many wonders An empire wider than the world beholds, Where nothing fails or fades. To longing eyes The absent there return, nor even know That they have been away. There, all alert As the task'd Genius of Arabian tales, Desire achieves impossibilities, Laughing, “That, only? See how soon 'tis done!” There, wishes whisper, “We have waited long To run thine errands. Whither shall we hie? What shall we fetch thee?” There, the crookèd path Lies straight; and, self-untwined, the tangled skein Falls smooth and even. The tired traveller fares Fleet over that immeasurable land All in a moment, stirring not a foot; While the chain'd culprit on the donjon stone In fancied innocence and freedom smiles, Deaf to the headsman's footfall at the door. For there the Realm of Consolation teems With miracles of mercy, by whose aid Misery to a dream the truth converts, The dream to a reality. And there Wherein the Poppy beholdeth his future kingdom. A whisper'd message hath the Poppy heard, “Behold a kingdom that awaits a king! But who is he that can possess it? Men Not long can live in it. The gods above, That live for ever, know it not. To them No need of consolation ever comes. And thou, who should'st the monarch of it be, Dost lack the regal robe, the kingly crown.” “Ay, but the kingly heart I lack not,” laughs The ambitious dreamer, “nor the regal will!” And all the while along the fields of sleep Phantasos comes and goes; and all the while The Poppy hears a husht voice, murmuring Words to the wakeful and the wise unknown. 'Twas night, deep night. The sevenfold heavens were thick The Visible Universe is a system and order of government, whereof the Sun is lord and ruler. But in system and order Absolute Liberty hath no place. This Universe existeth only by obedience to the laws that maintain its existence. Yet neither is any law absolutely true. Therefore is it in the negation of all things that Absolute Liberty seeketh Absolute Truth. To the light that rebel saith “Thou liest!” and to every fact “Thou art a fraud!” And because, for this reason, Absolute Liberty is everywhere repressed, its fierce destructive spirit would fain find in the delirium of intoxication a momentary escape from the tormenting consciousness of an eternal and universal restraint. But there it findeth only Madness; and, allied with Madness, it haunteth the Realm of Reality. There man's place is fixed. But his faith in its foundations is troubled by the influence of that turbulent Spirit; and a fear hath fallen on him from the ever-recurrent echoes of a voice wailing through the Visible Universe, “All is illusion!” Man, therefore, doth also aspire to the attainment of a world wherein Truth and Liberty are absolute. Every path to such a world the gods, its jealous guardians, have beset with snares; and in the grape man findeth only a false guide, gained over to their cause. When the foot of the climbing mortal is on the last step of their divine sanctuary, this false guide throweth off the flattering mask, and leaveth the dupe of its flatteries grovelling on the ground. With throbbing stars; and thro' them, seeking rest, Wander'd a restless and extravagant Spirit. Horsed on a comet's hurricane of fire, He pass'd the trembling Pleiads, and aflame His meteoric locks behind him stream'd Between the Lyre and Crown. “Dull Earth,” he moan'd, “Of thee I craved but freedom and repose; Yet ever hast thou mock'd me with the choice, Expulsion or imprisonment! And thou, Bright foe whose hate where'er I fly pursues, Tormenting and intolerable Sun, Is there from thee no refuge? Once I dwelt Safe, as I deem'd, within the grape's dim orb; But happiness on earth is never safe, And I was only happy. Who betray'd The asylum of my mystery? Men strove To wring that mystery from the garrulous grape, But the Sun fears me; and, lest all I know To all be known, the grape with fire he fill'd, Kindling confusion in his brain who blabs The secret whisper'd to the grape by me. Me, whom the world proscribes because it dreads My mockery of its miserable dupes!” Thus raved, in his rebellious wretchedness, Then doth the fierce Spirit whose whisper is madness, and whose motion is revolt, fly, a baffled proscript, from the Actual World that fears and rejects it. Passing beyond the bounds of Space and Time, which circumscribe the sphere of that world's influence, it enters the illimitable region of dreams, and wins from the charitable power of Phantasos admittance to an Ideal World where unrestricted truth is found in unrestricted fancy. There, Passion passes into Poësy: and, because the Absolute Law of that world is Absolute Liberty, there at last doth the rebel become the ruler, And, blind with passion, beat the eternal walls Of the unshaken Universe in vain, That rack'd fiend, Phrenoleptos. No escape Did his immense and sombre prison-house Vouchsafe the frenzied Spirit, and everywhere He sought what nowhere could he find; till, far Beyond the confines of Locality, Roaming the realms of Phantasos, he spied The snowy-vested flutter-headed flower That deem'd itself their monarch. “Ha!” quoth he, “Not big with gossip as the grape art thou, Pale visionary! and secure methinks In thy white bosom will my secret sleep.” Then stole the world's tired exile, unrebuked, Within the sweet heart of the Poppy's dreams. But there the power of Phantasos transform'd His turbulent passion's unappeasable cry Into that sacerdotal oracle Of Consolation's Realm, its listeners call The “Voice of Poësy. ”To them that voice Is murmuring still the secret of the world. And “Me,” it sighs, “the world doth still proscribe, Knowing that I am Freedom, which it fears; And men mistrust me still, for I reveal What they deny, refute what they affirm; And still my law is not as theirs, and still They deem me lawless, who have here regain'd My lost legitimate liberty. Beware, Poor slaves of Reason, who run after Truth! Wake her not. She is dreaming. Once awaked, Truth will be folly. Trouble not her dreams!” By all her flowery island lawns, and all Here doth a little legend that is new grow out of a great one that is old, as the fernfrond from the hollow oak. The nymph-loved hollows of Sicilian hills, Demeter sought Persephonè. She found 'Twixt lilied Cyane's low banks afloat The maiden's veil, but of the maiden's fate No further trace; and from her cry forlorn The river-nymph fled sighing to the sea. Seaward the goddess follow'd, swift of foot, And o'er the dark wind-furrow'd waters, clear As shines the white wing of a glancing gull, The flash of her unwetted sandal flew From shore to shore. Yet, round the orbèd earth The Quest of Ceres. All regions searching, news of her lost child Nowhere to guide her did Demeter get From gods or mortals. For the Son of Ops Had husht with gifts his kindred deities, And clamorous ignorance here, dumb terror there, Guarded his secret on the lips of men. Back to her Syracusan bowers she came, A wandering desolation in whose path Cornfield, and olive grove, and vineyard shed Their blighted fruits, and perish'd. Habit's ghost, Whose ways are backward to a goal that's gone, Hope's place assumed, and round the loved resorts Of a departed presence still renew'd The search by Hope abandon'd. Roaming thus That dale to Alpheus dear, she reach'd the fount Within whose chilly depths a home secure Chaste Artemis to Arethusa gave. There all day long beside the spring she stood, Grey, gaunt, and silent as its grotto'd rock, In a dumb trance. But when the sun was sunk Her anguish overflow'd. The mighty frame, Ravaged and wasted by a grief divine, Quick-rushing storms of sudden pangs convulsed; And, wide outstretching from her childless breast Arms like the lean boughs of a blasted oak, She cried aloud. The eagle, whose lone sleep No thunder rouses, from his sky-girt crag Responsive scream'd; the hooting sprites that haunt Deep mountain glens, a distant host, replied; And night's innumerable solitudes Shouted to one another in the dark. “Persephonè!” she call'd. “Persephonè,” The woods re-echo'd, and the long ravine. That many-voiced lament the sobbing fount Carried down earth's cold veins to it sea-source; Where round their urns, tired travellers from afar, Grey river-gods repose, and Tritons stall Their fin-tail'd steeds in azure caverns. There Arethusa makes known to Ceres the Rape of Proserpine. 'Twas heard by Arethusa. Naiad she, And Nereid both; to whom the hoary king Of all the waters of the world confides His brother's secrets and his own. For they Between them rule the deeps, Poseidon those Of Ocean, Pluto all that Orcus hides. Moved by Demeter's woe, the pitying nymph On her pure spring's oracular ripple arose, And all the wrong by Pluto done reveal'd, The infernal nuptials, and the ravisht bride. Then swift, with footsteps fierce as driving storms, The Daughter of Saturn, to whom her father gave the abundance of the earth, and her mother Vestæ its procreative fire, follows her vanished offspring underground; and the abodes of Death are invaded by the presence of a life-giving Power. To her dread goal the indignant goddess strode The mountain tops night-laden. From her frown The frighten'd dawn shrank, and beneath her foot The fixt earth shudder'd, as in wrath she reach'd That cavernous peak whose formidable crest, Flashing and thundering, reverberates The roar and glare of her Cyclopian Hearth. For 'mid the smoking snows of Etna burn For ever, fuell'd by a Titan's pain, Unquenchable fires; and the deep-throated gates Of vaults that plunge to the infernal gods There on their groaning hinges gape and rock, Shaken by sulphurous tempests. Her broad brows With blades of shaggy gold and blossoms blue The glowing goddess crown'd. A giant branch Torn from the sinews of a resinous pine She kindled, and in clanking harness yoked Fast to her brazen car its dragon team. Thus fiercely charioted, her strong right hand Above her waving that huge torch, the while Loud in her left she shook the rattling reins, Along the lampless chasms of nether night, (Wild homes of hurricanes subterranean) Crown'd with red corn she went, and robed in gems Of Autumn, gleaming thro' a dayless world. Between the silent realms of Sleep and Death, In the depths of Dreamland Demeter's dragon car for guidance paused At Dreamland's cloudy portals, whose husht valves At her approach roll'd open from within; And thro' those yawning gates, all ears and eyes, The blades and blossoms, garlanding the brows Of the great sunburnt goddess, peep'd alert. Deep in an evening-lighted land, that sloped By many an undulous declivity Of purple fold and emerald dimple, down From summits girt with golden clouds asleep In still abysms of azure air, to shores Of citied promontories crown'd with towers And gleaming ramparts acropolitan Mirror'd in luminous waters, all alone Upon a radiant eminence reclined The kingly Poppy. Of larger growth he look'd The Poppy reposes, Than his Sicilian kindred; sweeter light Than streams from earthly suns illumined all His snowy vesture; and above him stoop'd Weird Phantasos, whose procreant sorceries Fill'd, and then emptied, and then fill'd again With visionary images of life That fervid stillness. Of the god's breath born, Where Creative Fancy revels Up the high downs with spear and pennon sprang Resplendent armies; thick the bays beneath With masts in thousands bristled; and o'er the plank'd Wet wharfage merchants, mariners, and slaves Came swarming fast. Yet silent as the march In silence Of sculpture round some monumental frieze, The busy visions teem'd. Thro' column'd streets Went festal crowds that, to the temples trooping, Clash'd cymbals from whose kiss there came no sound; And, thridding sacred groves, the choral dance With rhythmic footstep heaved to flutes unheard. Anon, life's mimic pageant disappear'd, And solitude: all its creations being in itself and for itself alone. And o'er the re-establisht solitude Down-gazing, in the shadow of himself, Upon a peak in heaven a dusky god Sat sombre. One big star above him burn'd, And in the land below to worship him Was neither man nor beast. Creating thus And thus dissolving worlds at every breath, To charm the darling of Persephonè, Phantasos hover'd o'er the halcyon couch Of the deep-dreaming Poppy. And there, enwrapt By wonders, with a god to wait on him, But lost to earth and earth's realities, Lost to his native fields and natural life, Again the cornflowers and the corn beheld By the children of the Actual World the pupil of Phantasos is regarded as the slave of pernicious illusions; and the Corn would fain reclaim the Poppy. Their changed companion of the days of old. Sadly they hail'd him from afar. “Return, Stray'd child of Nature! To thy natural world Return, ere yet irrevocably lost In those vainglorious visions that beget The passion of the impossible!” they cried. And while the dragon chariot roll'd away Darkling, and Dreamland's gates behind it closed, Still linger'd the importunate appeal. “Hark, 'tis thy mother's children call thee! Home With us, thy kindred, hers and ours again!” No echo answer'd it. But as where'er, Incongruously with the dawn's rebuke, Thro' some shut house of revel a wakeful ray Whose faith in the sufficiency of the ideal life is shaken by sudden contact with realities, and the unexpected disapproval of those to whom reality is the only known measure of truth. Of daylight wanders, all the flaring lamps Burn sallow, and the panting dance appears Defaced and haggard, so thro' Dreamland went The horror of a disconcerting change; A troubled consciousness of something miss'd, A doubt of what remain'd. And from that hour The kingdom of the Poppy was confused. The Batwing'd God came flitting thro' the halls Morpheus explains to Proserpine how mortals are impelled, by the necessity of their nature, towards the realization of ideas; and how, if thwarted in that impulse, they pine for enjoyments unpossessed, in the midst of possessions unenjoyed. Of Hades. He approach'd Persephonè, And said, “Fair Queen, I warn'd thee!” “But what fails His measureless felicity?” she ask'd. “Hath he not all I wish'd him, the repose The glory, and the gladness of a god?” “Ay,” said the Son of Hypnos, “these he hath, But in dreams only; and a mortal, he. Hence this disorder. Heavy as despair Reality on mortal nature weighs. Amid the beauties and beatitudes Of his unreal kingdom, he recalls His waking life, his little rural home, The narrow field where he was born, the air He breathed on earth in common with his kind; And thus remembrance ruins his content, Marring its grace with incongruities.” Again she question'd him. “Since when the change?” And Morpheus answer'd, “When to these dark realms Thy mother came, her brows were garlanded With corn and cornflowers from the furrow'd glebe Whose harvests her Trinacrian barns enrich. By the dim borders where with thine and mine My brother's kingdom marches, halt she made, Uncertain, craving guidance at the gates Of Dreamland's citadel. For Phantasos To the unseen world the dead go by many ways, but they return by none; and from them there is no report of it. For the living all ways to it lie through the realm of Phantasos, whose ways are never the same. Among the guides he appoints for the conduct of travellers entering his dominion in search of it, are Faith, Hope, Fear, and Curiosity. Each guide conducts the seeker by a different road; each road takes him in a different direction; and which is the right one, who can say? For the geography of that world is written only by those who have never reached it. At those husht gates hath minions on the watch To proffer lone wayfarers phatom charts Of whatsoever lands unseen they seek; And wingèd visions that flit on before, Illumining the vast and shadowy void With beacon lights, he lends them. Dreamland oped At her approach, disclosing Mekon's realm, And all its wonders. There, when him once more Amazed they met, the corn and cornflowers hail'd Their old companion. O'er the fair deceits Of Phantasos a breath their presence breathed Of natural life, that from those golden lies The glory for a moment chased away. They gone, the old illusion reassumed The power to charm, but from its charm was pass'd The power to satisfy; and, unappeased, The dreamer pines to realize his dream; For now the pure impersonal delight First felt in dreaming it, he feels no more.” “Alas,” the Queen of Hades cried, “undone Is Mekon's realm! From torment what can save The self-tormented?” “Let the ingrate go, Nor Fate,” said Morpheus, “thwart! If wise she be, I know not, but I know that she is strong, And weak thy favourite. What, if his return To Earth she wills? When thine her will forbade, Did not the tasting of a single seed Of that Elysian fruit, she snared thee with, Suffice her froward purpose to defeat The fiat wrung from Zeus?” “To earth, alas,” The goddess answer'd, “who of mortal source From Death's dominion can return alive?” “From Death's dominion,” Morpheus murmur'd, “none. But Death o'er Dreamland hath no empery. There, Where Heaven, and Earth, and Hell, in one confused Mad welter of wild incongruities Are intermutual, and nothing true, All things are possible.” Persephonè Was troubled. “Summon Phantasos!” she sigh'd. But he, whose succourable power responds To sighs and wishes swifter than swift speech With thought keeps pace, ere Morpheus could reply, Was bending o'er her, radiant as a star. “Mourn not!” he said. “If for his Mother Earth Phantasos hath found his messenger. The Earth-born pines, from her maternal breast It skills not to withhold him. But this change, By me foreseen, my purpose favours. Long On earth an earthly messenger I sought, None finding worthy of my vast design. Now, all that fail'd me in this flower is found; A mortal fitted to receive, preserve, And with a boundless prodigality Impart to mortals, an immortal gift. On Mekon is my mystic mandate laid, And his henceforth the mission to reveal The Realm of Consolation to a race Else irremediably miserable. For him lament not! To his parent soil My wing shall waft him, there to roam or rest Till, from a world of subjugated woes And pacified repinings, he hath won The goodly kingdom he aspires to rule.” No answer biding, sudden as he came The fitful god departed. And anon The Poppy reappear'd upon the earth. The Poppy rejoins his earthly kindred. But in the crowd around him he is alone; his vast ambition unappeased, his goodly gifts unrecognized Dwelling unnoticed amongst those who, though closest to him, are furthest from the knowledge of what he is, he doth yet know himself to be a king. But only by the aid of that potent discontent which is the special attribute of Humanity, can he hope to gain possession of his kingdom. One morn he woke, and wondering found himself Back in his native field, a common flower. “O is it I,” he mused, “whose flimsy coat The wind thus flutters? mine, this heavy head, And cringing neck, that hang beneath the weight Of worlds unrealized? Within me pent, Is glowing unemploy'd a power divine To gladden others. But the blissful gods, Not having aught to wish for, scorn my gift, Wish-granting dreams. The flowers (my kin no more!) Are self-sufficing as the gods themselves; Beauty they lack not, and 'tis all they need. The birds from heaven, the beasts from earth, demand No gift but what from heaven and earth they get. But man? Insatiable mortal, made Conscious of immortality, in thee Methinks I see my promised kingdom! Men, My future subjects! I have watch'd you pass, Despondent, confident, by hope impell'd, By fear pursued, the sport of all desires, All wants, all whims, all passions; and, reveal'd In every look of your importunate eyes, I recognized a pilgrim to my realm. Yet all unheeded still you pass me by, And meanwhile, being without the insignia of sovereignty, his kinghood is unrecognized by his destined subjects. For 'tis appearances, and these alone, That men confide in. O for robe and crown! Mankind would in my kingdom then believe, Seeing in me the semblance of a king.” Poor crownless monarch of a realm denied, Lowly he lived among the crowded corn An inconspicuous life, or drooping roam'd By many a dusty roadside unremark'd. But when the wishful hour of sunset came, Along the solitary fields he sigh'd, “O thou who wast before the worlds began, He appealeth for aid to that invisible but present source of power, whence have issued all the visible manifestations of it. For this all-pervading potency feedeth the fountains of the sun with fire, and the veins of the earth with life, and thereby even the souls of men with thought. There cometh, in answer to the prayer of the Poppy, a whisper out of the West upon the wings of the Evening Wind. Thou, whose primordial potency uprear'd The vast pavilions of the universe, And call'd the stars from firmamental deeps Sun-breeding glory-bearing source of all, Infinite Æther, hear me, and give help!” Obedient to the Power he had invoked, Fine tremours search'd the lull'd air's breathless orb, And loosed from sleep the lightest wind of those That, moth-like, o'er rose-petall'd paths pursue With frolic wing their desultory flight. Over the smooth translucent pools impell'd, A roughening darkness tremulously ran; The wheatfields waved; and a sweet voice enquired, “Of me what wilt thou?” “Regal robe and crown!” The Poppy answer'd, “for a king am I.” “Fool,” sigh'd Favonius, “fond ambitious fool! The crown, a golden prison, incarcerates care In brows beneath it pent, and heavily hangs The blood-stain'd purple robe of royal power About the loaded shoulders it adorns. Such burdens, little one, thou couldst not bear.” “Ill thou divinest,” the proud suppliant said, The Poppy urgeth his claim to the crown. “What force immeasurable in me resides. Fear not to aid me!” “Be it as thou wilt!” Reproachfully that sighing voice replied. “The stern Fates punish the presumptuous He is warned by Favonius of the perilous character of the gifts he craves. But in vain. By granting their desires. Not mine the gifts Thou cravest. All my gifts are gifts of peace. The foresight of the gods hath fixt the crown Upon the inaccessible pinnacles Of mighty mountains, and the purple plunged Deep underneath unfathomable seas. He that can bring thee what thy pride hath craved Is the dread Storm-Wind that disturbs the deeps, And smites the summits. Him I will invoke. And Favonius invoketh the Storm Kings. Prepare thee to receive him when he comes! His voice is terrible, and his embrace Crushes what it caresses. Thou art warn'd.” Then, on his light wing soaring, the sweet Son Of starry Night and starless Erebus Glided along the Ocean's azure floor, And roused the Petrel sleeping on the wave. “Bird of the Storm, awake!” he cried, “thine hour Approaches. Where is Khamsin?” “Far away, The dry wind of the great desert. Him the Arabs call Khamsin; that is to say, the Fifty fold. For he cometh before, and he followeth after the Spring Equinox; and the period of his power waxeth till the Sun hath entered into Ares, and waneth when the Sun hath left the Ram; and two score and ten are the days thereof. And by the sand that he driveth eastward Sahara is enlarged, and Ægypt menaced. Hid,” said the Storm-Bird, “in the Nubian waste.” “Go seek him, bird, and bid him hither bring The emblems of imperial power!” “For whom?” “A mortal.” “Khamsin to a mortal's call No response deigns. His march hath overwhelm'd Memphis and Thebes, and to the Pyramids Close have his tawny cohorts laid their siege: For all the Orient he hath sworn to give To his beloved Sahara. Not to serve The ambition of a mortal, Khamsin roams Ægypt, and Æthiopia, and the lone Arabian desert, and the Libyan wilds.” “Call, then, Sirocco!” “He is sleeping still,” Sirocco sleepeth in the soft chambers of the South; and when he waketh the deathbell tolls The Petrel answer'd, “where he loves to rest In a white sea-girt city of the South Under a purple promontory. There, Above his sallow couch a reeky cloud Its poison-dropping canopy suspends; And in his husht embrace, by slaughterous feast To leaden slumber lull'd, about him clings His pale bride, Pestilence. Awake them not!” “Canst thou not bear a message to Simoom?” Simoom hath! reared his palaces above the tombs of Persian kings. At his approach the lion hideth in his lair, and the camel croucheth, and the camel-driver commendeth his soul unto Allah. “Simoom at sunset in Persepolis High revel holds, and round his blood-red throne The lions tremble. But beyond the realms Of Persia and of Araby his power Prevails not, nor beyond the waves my wing; Therefore to him no messenger am I.” “How fares Harmattan?” “On the scorch'd sea-shores Harmattan haunteth the shores of Guinea. He is dry and cold; and wherever he passeth, the grass of the field and the leaf of the forest are whitened, as by a leprosy, beneath the dust of his chariot wheels, But east and west, and north and south, in calm or storm, as his humour changeth, Monsoon roameth the vast waters of the Indian Ocean. Beneath the palms of Malabar a dusky Peri rocked his giant cradle, and on the rosy shores of Coromandel shining clouds have spread the couch of his repose. Ever, when the Sun is in the southern heaven, Monsoon marcheth north and east; and when the Sun is in the northern heaven, he hasteneth south and west. For of him to the feet of Himalay, laden with Ocean-plunder from the rifled treasuries of Ormuz and the isles that are rich in spice. He builds in Guinea travelling towers of dust To assail the Sun, his ancient enemy. Shrouded and sudden as a glaring ghost, Harmattan pass'd me, and I saw no more.” “Monsoon is in this season idle. Say, Hast thou not met him on the road to Ind?” The Petrel panted, shiver'd, and replied, “The sun had bared the brows of Himalay, And from Thibet's parch'd plain the tepid air Rose higher than hath ever soar'd the roc. Then, by the Void allured, Monsoon arose. In deluge from the rainy deep he rush'd Exultant, and beneath his dripping wing All Hindustan was darken'd, till he reach'd The Realm of the Five Rivers. Thence, sublime Along the lonely Asian glaciers, borne On sable clouds, whose swollen darkness flew, Scourged white by whips of fire, he pass'd away To his Uranian halls. And there he waits To speed the downfall of the avalanche.” “What of Typhoon?” The Petrel rose and scream'd, “Look yonder at Orion, and beware! Typhoon is coming. Way for King Typhoon!” Then, lashing with her sharp wing the white crests Of the roused waves, the Prophetess of Storm The coming of King Typhoon. Who cometh with robe and crown from the sultry seas of Cathay; Fled fast before the coming of her lord. Over the rocking seas and ravaged lands, In fulgent state, with trump sonorous, march'd Typhoon's insulting majesty. The tops Of tallest forests underneath him crouch'd, And crack'd, and trembled like the grass o' the field. Aloft he brandish'd in his livid grasp The streaming rags of the rent thunder-clouds, And shrill he sang, “Both robe and crown I bring! And, having the symbols of power, The crown of terror, and the robe of wrath, A spoil'd world's gold and purple! But for whom? Where is the giant destin'd to support This weight of glory?” A faint infant voice Lisp'd eager, “He is here, and I am he!” Low stoop'd Typhoon, and search'd long while the ground. “Thou! Who art thou, pert pygmy?” “One that claims For what is strongest upon earth—Desire, The robe and crown,” that lisping voice replied, And loud and long the savage Storm-King laugh'd. Despiseth the power of him that hath them not. “Wretched enough is Royalty,” he growl'd, “But 'tis not yet ridiculous. Empty pate, Take that for thine ambition!” And he flung The Poppy upon the flint. But its small root, Fast as an anchor fixt, the shock withstood Of him who shatters in his boisterous sport Great Carthaginian triremes, and the tall Phœnician galleys, as a wassailer strews With broken cups and wine-flasks the drench'd floor Of his disorder'd palace. “Saucy weed!” Mutter'd Typhoon, “who granted thee the strength Thy miserable aspect so belies?” “'Tis Phantasos,” the Poppy said. “Behold! Nevertheless the Poppy, reasserting his claim to the crown, doth justify the same, undaunted by the wrath of Typhoon; Not empty, as thou deemest, is my head. Seest thou these lucid beads—in each, a world Of beauty, sweetness, and sublimity? These are my treasures. And as they in me Are living now, so ages hence in them Shall I be living. Thou dost boast of realms Made deserts by the desolating breath Of thy dread nostril; but not all thy power He being, Can overthrow the kingdom I command. Down from the rockt mast's windy rigging hurl by right divine, Lord Paramount of the Kingdom of Consolation. The sleeping seaman to his ocean grave, And in the fearful moment of his fall He will have deem'd that him some wing divine Is bearing to the bosom of the gods. I call back smiles to the sad lips of her Whom thou hast widow'd in the midnight storm. Mine is in all the world the sole domain Death cannot enter. Kings my subjects be, And in my lap they cast their cares away. I gather up the fallen leaves of life, And in a moment make them green again. I breathe upon the worn-out hours of time, And round the paths of unarisen suns My breath sustains their renovated flight.” But Material, jealous of Ideal Force, would banish to Heaven the dreams of Earth; Resentfully the sullen answer hiss'd: “If such thy power, if such indeed thy gifts, Rashly hast thou reveal'd them. Canst thou deem That I, the wandering soul of him who slew Osiris, I whose dauntless pride hath toss'd, Untamed by anguish, unsubdued by fire, On Etna's burning bed, will leave to men The meek enjoyment of what far transcends The bliss I grudge the gods? Thy vanity Hath doom'd thee to destruction!” At the word, And the Poppy is wounded and taken captive. The Titan Storm-King, terrible Typhoon, Sprang with a shout on that pale King of Dreams, And strangled him, and twisted off his head, And with the trophy thro' the starr'd abyss Soar'd up into the solitudes of space, Beyond the watch-fires of the Universe. There, thro' the lone translucent void, Typhoon Scatter'd the silver seeds of golden dreams. Where'er they fell, from flowers to stars they turn'd, And in that pure ethereal field put forth A multitude of pallid radiances, By wondering mortals call'd “The Milky Way.” But one of them, one seedling of a dream, That in its little germ perchance contain'd Aided by Favonius, and carried like Anchises by his offspring, he escapeth from his captor, bearing with him the saved secret of his power. Undream'd-of dreamlands, on the way was lost Twixt earth and heaven. Favonius all this while, Rockt as a cradled infant in the robe Of the rough Storm-King, watch'd the whirling seeds. But he, the patron of the hopes of earth, Pitied their floral prophet's desperate plight, And from the turgid mantle of Typhoon Caught in his fragrant bosom, as it fell, This wandering grain. There was a rocky isle Which, with good counsel to the discomfited aspirant, Favonius conceals among the rocks of an uninhabited island; Where no man dwelt, and whither nothing came But winds, and birds, and the storm-billow'd waves Of a wild sea. Favonius, hovering here, Whisper'd, “Last germ of an ideal world Rejected by the mighty, wait in hope Thy promised hour! The gifts thou didst demand I could not give thee. But I give thee now A gift the punctual Destinies deny To sceptred kings—illimitable time! From wistful slumber, oft as spring returns, My breath shall wake thee to a life renew'd; And thou, survivor of a thousand storms, Shalt greet a thousand summers with the smile Of an invincibly re-orient bloom. Never, child, never will the hands that grasp The globe and sceptre yield thee crown or robe! The gold is for the great, for the supreme The purple. Neither Pomp nor Glory grant To thee their emblems. But the little hand Of Childhood opens lightly, and its gifts Are tendernesses that are given ungrudged. Seek, then, poor child, from other children seek What Childhood gives—its rosy-mantled mirth, Its diadem of innocent delight, Such robe and crown as never king yet wore!” And lightly, softly, as her sleeping babe Safe to its shelter'd cot a mother bears, Earthward that orphan seed Favonius wafted, And laid it in the crevice of a crag. Tenaciously the grateful crag's stout heart And there, sown by a fleeting hope in a barren soil, the rescued germ of worlds unborn puts forth a dubious blossom. Conceal'd the rescued treasure; and anon To the thin root that from it crept and craved, Feeling about for nurture and support, Three gifts vouchsafed—(the crag's own attributes) Loftiness, loneliness, and steadfastness. So still the Poppy dream'd; and still his dreams Were of an empire wider than the world, A royal mantle, and a kingly crown. And still the ages came, the ages went; But him they brought no grander gifts than those The guardian rock had given him. All alone, With neither robe nor crown nor kingdom, he, Of that I shall have also cause to speak.—Horatio. Dreaming of kingdom crown and robe to come, Awaited the fulfilment of his dream. I. THE COURT. Now, once upon a time there was a king. Supplies a missing chapter of the Almanac de Gotha, King of a country once upon a time Call'd Diadummiania, was he. His kingdom's capital was Diadum, And Diadummianus was his name. This simple statement—“Once upon a time And describes a land undreamed of in Geography: There was a king, et cætera”—may appear Somewhat indefinite to all whose minds Have by Geography been prejudiced, Or warp'd by History; for such folks persist In always asking (just like children) where, And when, and how things happen'd. To appease Which is an exact science; as is proved by the well-known fact that, when a geographer has disappeared without leaving his dress, and it is nearly certain that he has met with some fatal disaster. Geography, at great expense, equips an expedition to make quite certain of it. For such is the exactitude of this science, that it takes no account of the mere probability of disaster, however great; whilst, on the other hand, it has furnished us with accurate knowledge of the actual occurrence of a vast number of extraordinary disasters, which, but for geographic research, might never have occurred. Their puerile curiosity, the world Acknowledged by Geography contains Those places only that a man may reach By sea or land, incurring as he goes The risk of being sea-sick, ship-wreck'd, drown'd, Robb'd by inn-keeping rogues along the road, Or search'd upon the frontier by police. Neither by land, however, nor by sea Need travellers any sort of risk incur In reaching Diadummiania, And therefore it is mention'd on no map. Yet where else could have happen'd all the things About to be related in this book? Certainly not in England. Anywhere Except in Diadummiania They would have been impossible. 'Tis true That Diadummiania as yet Is unacknowledged by Geography; But this, tho' true, proves nothing. The north pole Geography acknowledges with pride; And yet, instead of it, discoverers find Only the frozen carcasses of those By whom 'twas not discover'd. True it is, Moreover, that to none of the events In this authentic chronicle set forth Hath History any notice yet vouchsafed. But what of that? Geographers at least, Thus, the labours of Geographers promote the knowing of the previously known. Even when they find not what they seek, succeed In sometimes finding what they have not sought; And then, by merely finding it, they prove That what they happen to have found, exists. But what Historians seek exists no more, Whereas those of Historians tend to the unknowing of the previously Known: the oldest historical fact being always soluble by the newest historical theory. And what they find is but a record left Of something which, for aught that record proves, May never have existed. Scripta manent! Ay, and the Ministerial Journalist, Whose scripture daily decks our morning meal, To coming ages glowingly presents Pictures of how this favour'd realm of ours Its present gifted government preserves From every possible peril, and endows With countless blessings coveted in vain By all the other nations of the world. What past was ever such a present? Turn The first page of the Opposition Print, And all those glowing pictures melt in gloom. If History's prime architect, blind Chance, Of these two scriptures should select the first For the instruction of the babes unborn, Posterity will certainly affirm That in the west of Europe, at the close Of that enlighten'd century, the nineteenth, There bloom'd a better'd Arcady. But ah, The second scripture may the first survive, And then, in after ages, by mistake Folks will confound Great Britain with Byzant. The scripture stays, the truth escapes—perchance Authorities consulted by the Diadummianian historian. In flying words; and men the meaning miss Of ‘Scripta manent, verba volant.’ Words, Fugitive migratory words, there be, That birdlike hover in the air, and fleet By ways invisible from land to land. In every language they have left behind Their lingering echoes. Native air they breathe In every clime, and every folk believes It was the first to hear them. Round the world, Safe over shipless seas, untrodden wastes, And mountain tops impassable, they pass. Their passage none can stop, none stay their flight, Their antiquity and popularity. Nor set the uncertain course of it. But, fraught With intimations from afar, in flocks Or singly, here and there they settle down Unbidden; and where rural homes abound They build, and brood, and, singing, fill men's hearts With wonder, and men's memories with song. That song in written speech no more abides Than the lark's music, or the nightingale's, And Science scorns it. But the untutor'd folk, Whose bookless lore was old ere hers began, List to it, love it, learn it, and transmit Traditions of its truth from age to age. 'Tis they whose witness warrants our belief That once upon a time there was a king, And Diadummianus was his name. His was a goodly kingdom. Safe asleep A United Kingdom. There in its birthplace Monarchy reposed. No otherwhere, nor ever since that once, Hath such a kingdom been. Time's restless waves The wandering cradle of the nations waft Hither and thither; and to every shore That gives it shelter that toss'd bark bequeathes A handful of invaders. In the blood Of its inhabitants these bandits soak The soil that gives them hospitality; And, when no drop of native blood remains, They patriotically shed their own For what they call their native land, a realm Foreign itself, by foreigners possess'd. But hoary Monarchy's dim childhood slept In Diadummiania secure Where it was born: and to the king the land, As to the babe its mother's breast, belong'd; He to the land, as its indigenous hills And immemorial forests. Now, the throne Acta Diadummiania. Of Diadummiania had pass'd Age after age from princely sire to son In male succession, till this tale begins; When, after many a year of hope deferr'd Her Majesty the Queen was brought to bed. The public duty tardily perform'd On that occasion was her life's last act. Death of the Queen Consort. But on the day before she left this world Her Majesty most graciously vouchsafed To introduce to it (with due regard To all court rules for royal births and deaths) A little princess: who, as soon as born, And birth of the Princess Diadema. Was christen'd Diadema. When the King Heard that his Heir Apparent was a girl, His royal mind was mightily perplex'd. Which gives rise to a dynastic difficulty. Never before had such a case occurr'd, And no provision for it could be found In any of the statutes of the realm. The Court Physician fell into disgrace Disgrace of the Court Physician. In consequence of this untoward event; For which all felt that someone was to blame, And if not he, then who? He had deliver'd The Queen in her own presence, and of a child Whose sex was contrary to precedent! The funds went down: the oracles went wild: Disturbed state of public opinion, The weathercocks went every way about And back again, for they no longer knew Which way to turn. These minatory signs Alarm'd the Government: and, with concern, The Minister of Public Safety learn'd From the Inspector General of Police That lately in the streets of Diadum The sanguinary and seditious cry Of Cherry Ripe had more than once been heard. And increasing popular excitement. That was the revolutionary song, The Diadummianian Marseillaise. Whenever it was heard about the streets You might be sure that things were getting hot. A Deputation, led by the Lord Mayor, Deputation to the King. Proceeded to the Palace; where, the King, Acting upon his ministers' advice, Was graciously, with much displeasure, pleased To give it audience. The Lord Mayor, in terms Respectfully but firmly out of place, Address'd his Majesty; referring first To cases teeming with embarrassments Of various kinds which, having all occurr'd In previous reigns, might happily have served As precedents for this particular case, Had they in aught resembled it. He next Express'd a hope, unflatteringly faint, That still, henceforth as heretofore, the Crown Of Diadummiania might be With undiminish'd dignity maintain'd; And nothing ever suffer'd to deprive With Petition of Rights. Its loyal subjects of their right to pay For trying, every now and then, new kinds Of gunnery against new kinds of scarps And counterscarps, on territories own'd By foreign princes: thus promoting peace, Which States would have no opportunity Of making, if they never went to war. These patriotic duties of the Crown Concern'd the People; who, altho' it paid For their performance, had some cause to fear That, if the Crown were clothed in petticoats, Its feminine possessor might not feel The proper manly pride in them display'd By those great princes who, before her birth, (Which so unconstitutionally changed The Constitution's sex) had grandly worn The cock'd hat, leather breeches, and jack boots Of Diadummianian Majesty. The People's claim to its full money's worth Speech by the Lord Mayor. Of national discomfort and renown Was with appropriate amplitude set forth By Diadum's chief magistrate: who thus Concluded his remarkable address— “Sire, of all subjects, to your subjects all, Taxation is the dearest, and indeed 'Tis growing annually dearer still. For hitherto the right of being tax'd To none except convicted criminals, Paupers, and lunatics hath been denied.” He ceased: and, but for that impetuous rush Attitude of the Municipal Body. Of quite ungovernable self-restraint The Royal Presence commonly call'd forth In those admitted to it, loud applause From all his fellow-worthies would have hail'd His eloquent oration's welcome close. Since courtly etiquette, however, check'd Their rising cheers, the Aldermen remain'd Emphatically mute, with lips compress'd, And looks down bent, whilst one of them began To scratch his ear, and tight in puckers shut The corresponding eye; implying thus The feeling of the City, that affairs Were ticklish, and the civic outlook dark. The King, alarmed. Across the King's distracted fancy came A horrible suspicion there might be Some meaning latent in the Lord Mayor's speech; And to the Chancellor, in great alarm, He whisper'd, “What the Dickens does he mean?” Consults the Chancellor. The Chancellor evasively replied, “Ah, what a lord mayor means must be confess'd One of the greatest mysteries! But Sire Excuse me. I was thinking, and I think The Chancellor has an idea. That I have an idea.” “Never mind! We trust you none the less,” the King replied. “If you could understand a word he said, Answer him! But be short! And pray, my Lord, Be careful not to compromise the Crown!” The Chancellor was never at a loss He takes an advanced step To answer anyone. With grace severe, Forward he stepp'd: and everybody felt The Government by that judicious step Had strengthen'd its position. Forth he drew, And thrice sedately tapp'd, the jewell'd box Wherein he carried his pulvilio. This made a deep impression. The belief Had long been prevalent in Diadum That the Lord Chancellor was capable Of anything, when driven to a pinch. “Sire,” said His Excellency, “we propose And puts forward his financial policy. To meet the dangerous contingency His Worship has sagaciously foreseen, By levying all the taxes in advance.” That was the great Lord Chancellor's idea, And it was then a novel one. Meanwhile, The Lord Mayor at an open window stood; The Lord Mayor's pocket-handkerchief In order, if occasion should arise For such a public duty, to step out Into the balcony, and thence harangue The populace below it. The Lord Mayor Was puzzled by the Chancellor's idea. He knew not whether it conceal'd a trap, Or granted a concession. Oft before In similar positions he had found, When doubting what to say, or how behave, That by the simple blowing of his nose He both gain'd time and also clear'd his head. So from his pocket thoughtfully he pull'd His pocket-handkerchief. A little breeze, That round the open window chanced to blow, Flutter'd the handkerchief; and this produced Responsive flutterings in the crowd beneath. His Worship felt the moment had arrived. Into the balcony he stepp'd, and there To the expectant multitude he waved His pocket-handkerchief. Whereat the mouths Of all the multitude with one accord Is used with the happiest effect. Began to cry aloud, “Long live the King!” It was the merest chance they did not cry, “Long live the Revolution!” or begin Singing in chorus that seditious song Of Cherry Ripe! But for their loyal cheer There was a cause, a reasonable cause, A theory of colours not anticipated by Newton. Credecolori! Altho', no doubt, an accidental one. For different colours act upon a crowd In different ways. Above it boldly wave A red flag, and forthwith it is The Mob, A white one, and as quickly it becomes “The King's Devoted People.” Had the hue Of the municipal signal, then display'd, Unluckily been red instead of white, Everything might have instantly gone wrong, And everybody been dissatisfied. But luckily 'twas white instead of red, So everything went well, and everyone Was satisfied. Except, perhaps, the King; Who seem'd not altogether pleased to see His subjects so concern'd about a crown Which, after all, was his crown and not theirs. Proud of his pocket-handkerchief's effect A State relic, carefully preserved in the Diadummianian Arsenal. Upon the public mind, and quite convinced That in his pocket he was carrying His country's future fortunes, the Lord Mayor Took from a Page, who follow'd in his train, A crimson velvet cushion, only used On great occasions, when it served to bear The keys of Diadummianian towns, Presented, with a patriotic speech, By their municipal authorities To the besieging enemy. Therewith The cradle of the Princess he approach'd, Knelt on one knee, and from a ribbon'd scroll Read to Her Royal Highness this address— “Moost myghty Pryncesse! Congratulatory address to the Crown Princess We, ye burghesses And cyte counceyllors of Diadum, Desyre on thys occasyon to professe More pleasyr than can possybly be felte That yow have condescendyd to be borne. We dutyfully hoped yow wold have deygned, Moost myghty Pryncesse, to be borne a prynce. But, fylled with pyous &amp; unbounded feythe In ye mystakes of Prouydence, our hertes Welcom Your Royal Hyhenes with a joye More easely descrybed than understood.” The little Princess to these loyal words Strange behaviour of Her Royal Highness. Listen'd, whilst sucking, with serene assent, In her sweet, warm, wet rosebud of a mouth A Gingerbread Gilt Captain of Dragoons. This military sweetmeat was a gift Presented to her by his Majesty To please the Army. The Lord Chancellor, A military officer loses his head at a critical moment. However, whose all-watchful eye was fixt Upon the Princess and the gay Dragoon, With secret agitation now perceived That brilliant, but too favour'd, officer Had lost his head. At once, with timely tact, Presence of mind displayed by the Lord Chancellor. The wary minister stepp'd in between The cradle and court-circle. “My Lord Mayor, Her Royal Highness has received,” said he, “With the appreciation it deserves Your loyal and appropriate address.” These words politely signified, “Be off! Dismissal of the Deputation. The ceremony's over.” For a time Appearances were saved by this device, And without comment the bad omen pass'd. But later on (for after the event Predicted by them all prognostics thus Excite attention) when the next sham fights A failure proved, the Opposition Press Opinions of the press. Noticed the fact, and bitterly remark'd, “If our ideal military type Has lost his head, what have we to expect From all our actual military heads?” Prosecution for libel. The Chancellor submitted to the King A note requesting leave to prosecute The writers of those libellous words, “design'd Unpatriotically to impair The State's external safety,” he observed, “By casting doubts on the efficiency Of Diadummiania's martial power.” Whereon His Majesty thus minuted: The King maintains the efficiency of the Army. “Fiat. The nation should be reassured. Our gallant army may with confidence Be counted on to beat whatever force Is weaker or less skilful than its own; And more than this no army can achieve. As for our Generals, we know them fit To frighten anyone. They frighten us.” So ended that most memorable day. But, when the Deputation was dismiss'd, A Privy Counsellor not in the Privy Council. His Majesty in secret sought advice From one whose influence o'er the royal mind, Being a backstairs influence, had it been To his unconscious Cabinet betray'd, Would, as he knew, most probably have caused A ministerial crisis. For the King On all important matters, ever since His prosperous accession to the throne, Had privately consulted his old nurse, Dame Rhoda. Long past active service now, And placed upon the Pension List, she still Her rank and title at the Court retain'd, Official ranks, civil, military, and trophophoric. As Grand Hereditary Head Nurse: rank That, by its code, the Official Hierarchy Of Diadummiania recognized As full equivalent, in Civil Grade, To that of a Lieutenant-General In military dignity, or else To the position on the Navy List Of a Vice-Admiral. The Titular Head Of the State's Lactary Department, she; Chief Marshal of the Mammelary Corps Of Body Guards about the Royal Babes Of Diadummianian Dynasties. And, tho' no more her matron bosom flow'd With alimental founts for infant lips, Yet still for comfort, as a babe for milk, There's no offence, my lord. Horatio. To her the old King in his troubles turn'd. II. THE DAME. As wrinkled and as full of oracles An old Portrait. As one of wise Dodona's wither'd leaves, Was old Dame Rhoda. Dear her homely talk To high and low, and long her homely form To every Diadummianian hearth Had been familiar as a household saint's. A little shrunken body, pucker'd, creased, And blanch'd from top to toe beneath the weight Of whitening years, but animated still By a brisk birdlike spirit, nose sharp-beak'd, And eye that twinkled as a spark the dew Hangs in some cobwebb'd hollow of a gnarl'd And rifted thorn, were hers. High snowy ruff, High peakèd hat, high shoe with scarlet heel, High scarlet-broider'd stomacher, she wore, And gaily-quilted petticoat. The staff Crutch-handled, 'twas her wont to lean on, seem'd Rather to guide and grace than to support Her nimble footsteps. A divining rod Perchance it was; for no suspicious hole Or corner did its ferule leave unprobed, No stone unturn'd that hid a sullen toad, Or clod that covert to a shrew mouse gave: And smartly, as she stept, it struck the ground With a precise authoritative tap, As tho' it were Dame Wisdom's pursuivant. Her birth and birthplace were forgotten things, But things forgotten she remember'd well; And (like a stream that, chattering blithe and brisk By cottage doors, hath in it all the while Mysterious sounds, the reminiscences Of mountain lands) her talk, tho' trivial, teem'd With startling tones and accents that belong'd To the lost language of a far-off time. Full many a tale beneath the harvest moon History is dated, for it begins and ends. But Tradition is eternal; and any date, however ancient, would rejuvenate eternity. The idea of eternity embodies itself only in types: and the eternal type of Tradition isan embodiment of the faith of Childhood in the form of Old Age. In its grotesqueness is its comeliness; and to it superstitions and myths are as becoming as wrinkles and grey hairs to an old woman. Home with their sheaves the merry gleaners brought, Full many a song the houseless herdsmen sung At midnight sitting by their mountain fires, Of old Dame Rhoda and the days of old. And agèd gossips, when December's dim Short days were shutting, and the ingle glow'd (While round it, husht to hear their whisper'd talk, The young ones gather'd) could a time recall When they themselves had in their childhood heard How once, on some such other winter's eve, At that same hour Dame Rhoda pusht the latch, And enter'd in, and by the hearth sat down, And forthwith to the house familiar seem'd As those that were beneath its rooftree born. For well the family chronicle she knew Of all their lives, and all the lives of those Without whose lives their own had never been: And fuller than a tombstone of good words About the dead was her discourse. Nor stored With portraits only was it, that surpass'd All masterpieces of the limner's art In rare resemblance to the buried kin Of John and Joan, whose features still survived In Jack and Gill, but it abounded too In tales, as tho' by an eye-witness told, Of things to none but an eye-witness known, That happen'd when the hoary world was young, And still a daily wonder to itself. She knew, and she could tell, the maiden name Reminiscences of an old traveller. Of Adam's wife before he married Eve; The deeds by Lilith's demon children done; The site of cities built before the flood By Tubal Cain; and where the forests grew His sons hew'd down to fuel his first forge; The talk that went about the streets of Thebes When Pharaoh's daughter with a babe appear'd, And said she found it in the bulrush beds; The whispers that were heard in Memphian halls When Rhampsinitus chose for son-in-law The wily robber with the dead man's hand; And what it was set laughing all the leaves Of sacred Lebanon, as Sheba's Queen Athwart a treacherous floor of glass, that show'd Her secret charms, with unsuspecting steps The throne of wizard Solomon approach'd. And when the Dame had told them all these things, With many more they never else had known, She pass'd upon her way—as they supposed, To the King's palace. Wondrous old even then Did folks then old believe her. Wondrous old Some deem'd her born. But all the land about A legend lived, that in the old old days A buxom youth was hers, and that the Dame Was still a damsel when she oped the door To disimprison'd Peter, as behoved A handmaid in the household of Saint Mark. Vide Acta Apostolorum. Howe'er that be, no damsel was she now. Learnèd she was, tho', in all lore occult; Lost sciences. Could find a coffin in a candlewick, Gifts in the white spots upon finger-nails, Troubles beneath salt-cellars overturn'd, And funerals in the flags of sable smut That sometimes deck'd the royal kitchen-grates. Far future fates, moreover, could she tell From tea-leaves, coffee-grouts, and playingcards, So wonderfully that the good old King Revered her more than his Lord Chancellor, And in her presence felt himself a child. The King had hung his crown upon a peg, Monarchy is happiest and most at ease when, apart from its externals, it is cherished by Tradition. His head in silken nightcap swathed, his feet In slippers thrust, his vest unbutton'd, fill'd His pipe, and closely drawn his elbow-chair Into the chimney corner. There, well pleased, He sniffd the scent of Mocha beans fresh bruised For fragrant brewage in a magic urn Before him by the sorceress set. Meanwhile She, bending o'er it, plied her sable spells. Three times the black decoction rose and sank, Dame Rhoda consults the omens. Heaving and sighing like a human heart By some unquiet secret vext. The crone Perused its mystic spasms, her cavern'd eyes Gleaming encircled by the ebon hoops Of sprawling spectales that bridged with black Her bony nose. Thro' aromatic mists Of thickening steam a great grey owl she look'd, That, wrapt in vague and moony vapour, peers, Watching a mouse. Her crookèd left hand clutch'd A pack of cards, and in her right she held A slanted mirror. As the charm increased, Her image into that of a huge bird With hornèd head, hook'd beak, and saucer eyes, Was slowly changing, when the magic glass Suddenly from her palsied claw she dropp'd Into the black and scalding sediment, That, scatter'd by it, splash'd the old King's cheek. Tradition is shocked, and the repose of Monarchy disturbed. “She gives away the crown!” Dame Rhoda croak'd. “She!” querulously cried the wincing King, “Who's she?” “Thy daughter,” groan'd the Dame. “Pooh, pooh! Never,” he mutter'd, “child of mine could be Such a born stup . .”— But here he check'd himself The King's inadvertence endangers the dynasty. Abruptly, shaken by an aguish fear. For he remember'd, only just in time, An ancient prophecy, that if the word He was about to utter were applied By one of the Blood Royal to the name Of any member of the Royal House, A dreadful secret of the dynasty Would be divulged. The Dame, rebukeful, raised A warning finger. “Son,” she whisper'd, “hush!” And for a while in shuddering silence each The other eyed. Then, slowly reassured, Up from the floor his fallen pipe she pick'd, And, having lighted its replenisht bowl, Bade him be still and listen. He obey'd, The answer of the Oracle. And thus her vision strange the seeress told: Dame Rhoda's Vision. “At first my sight was troubled, like my soul, Infancy and the Infinite. And all was dim. From heaven's four corners came Mists upon mists, that round each other roll'd Into a vapour glowing like a rose. Deep in the flusht heart of this fervid cloud “Something began to throb; and the cloud's self Was silently unclaspt, as when a bud Is breathed on by the Spirit of the Spring, And turns into a blossom. Fold by fold, Like roseleaves, all those rosy vapours oped, And in the mellow midmost of them all I saw our little princess—rosy too, And looking like the babe of that rose bud. Then for awhile the child seem'd all confused, The Gates of Birth are closed behind the New Born. And rubb'd her wondering eyes, like those new-waked Who cannot yet imagine where they are, Nor even recollect where they have been. Before her and around, bare pathless space Unfolding the monotonous expanse Of its immeasurable uncertainty, So frighten'd her that, if she could, methought The little creature would have crept again Into the vaporous rose whence she was come. But it had vanish'd, as a flower o'erblown “Whose loosened petals on the wind depart Unnoticed, and her refuge was no more. So timorously round her gazed the child. What Childhood carries with it. And all her timorous gazes as they fell Turn'd into falling stars, and every star Call'd to her, ‘Take me with thee!’ Stooping down She gathered up those stars, and one by one She put them in her bosom. Thence they shed A soft and tender light to guide her steps Along the pathless space. And more and more, As step by step her little star-led feet Moved onward, other voices I could hear Still calling to her, ‘Take us with thee, too!’ One of them call'd her from her fluttering curls, And when she raised her hand to them 'twas touch'd The universal messenger. By something fresh and cold that faintly sigh'd, ‘I am the wind. 'Tis from the earth I come, And it is there that thou art going. There They all are hoping, waiting, for thee now. “‘And me they sent to seek thee. Once my home When will the wind cease from sighing or the heart from wishing? Was in their hearts, but there no room I found To breathe in. For the sighing of my breath Gives voice to all the wishes in the world, And I am always sighing. Were I free, I would go hither, thither, every where, Forever. But I cannot leave the earth Where I was born, and have so much to do.’ And the child listen'd to the suppliant wind, The Earth and the Moon. And let him lead her. When at last they came Nearer to earth, she gazed beneath and saw What seem'd to be a star that could not shine, Like a blind eye that in its orbit rolls Darkly, reflecting nothing. And the child “Why so dark, sad Earth?” Pitied that poor blind star, and would have thrown One of her own sweet stars to brighten it. But pale with fear her own star turn'd, and said, ‘Condemn me not to dwell in yonder world! “And why so pale, sad Moon?” Let me rest here. Rather than live on earth “‘Fain would I hide me in the deeps of night, The night, that is ever between them, makes the Moon so pale and the Earth so dark, when they gaze upon each other. Contented to be nothing but a moon. But I will wait for thee in heaven, and watch Till thou returnest. For return thou wilt, Unhappy child! Earth is not all so sweet.’ Then the child sigh'd. And as she wander'd on And life goes on—wishing for the moon, and leaving behind it what it wishes. She left the moon behind her. And the moon Lingered in heaven, and waited for her, pale, Pensive, and patient. And the child went on. ‘Welcome at last, long waited! Is it thou? Heralds and harbingers. Come, then, with us! and we will show thee all,’ A tremulous choir of twittering voices cried. The swallows they, that far across the sea Had flown to find her. And upon their wings, Together with the Spring, they carried her. So o'er the sea-waves, o'er the mountain-tops, The maiden pass'd: and, coming from afar, The Spring came with her, and the Spring and she Seem'd one. The wind went softly on before; “And, as she follow'd, all the Ocean waves Whisper'd, ‘Child, take us with thee!’ All the woods Childhood and Nature. And mountains murmur'd, ‘Take us with thee, child!’ The lakes, the rivers, and the rivulets, The vales, and dells, and lawns, and meadows sigh'd, ‘Where'er thou goest, leave us not behind!’ And everything that thus appeal'd to her The Macrocosm in the Microcosm. Made itself small, that she might carry it. The sea condensed itself into a pearl, The mountains became precious stones, the woods In one green acorn countless oaks enclosed, The meadows dwindled to a tuft of moss, And all the lakes and rivers were distill'd Into a silver dewdrop, that the child Might bear them in her bosom. But her steps Terrestrial influences, of which it is unconscious, take possession of Childhood; insensibly transforming it to Maidenhood. No sooner touch'd the earth than from its pores Came voices muttering, ‘Lo, at last, 'tis she, Our promised Queen! Fast hold her!’ And forthwith “A something made of multitudes of things, Shapeless, voluminous, invincible, As with a hundred thousand hands and arms Embracing, drew her slowly softly down Into the earth's deep bosom. Hidden there, The Sleeping Beauty. She fell asleep. Above her buried head The little birds sang busy in the sun, And grass and daisies sprouted. Day and night Along their wonted undiscerning ways Went after one another round the world, And knew not she was sleeping underneath. But in her bosom safe the child still held The treasures she had gather'd as she came: The pearl, the tuft of moss, the precious stones, The acorn, and the drop of silver dew, That were wide plains, impenetrable woods, Rivers, and mountains, and the mighty sea. There, while she slept, a watchful Dragon crouch'd, And the Guardian Dragon. And with his body block'd the cavern's mouth. “But thro' the earth above the fine white roots Of flowers innumerable came creeping in, And found her sleeping, and were fill'd with joy. The dragon said to these discoverers, ‘Say nothing! If men found our treasure out, It would not long be ours.’ The little roots Laugh'd, ‘Men? They know not even how we came here, And what we say they cannot understand.’ But the wise Dragon answer'd, ‘That may be, Yet still I do not trust them.’ Then he breathed On all the roots, and every one of them Became immediately as dumb as death. Nevertheless the Dragon's jealous care Beauty will out. Could not prevent those roots from being bathed Silently in the sweet child's sleeping breath, Which they transmitted to the flowers above; And from the lips of the delighted flowers The fragrance of it wander'd through the world. “Nor any better could that Dragon sage Hinder the sources of the salient springs From listening. And those sources overheard All that the child was murmuring in her dreams, And carried it away, and babbled it About the hills and dales from land to land. Seeing the child so fair, the Dragon said, While Beauty sleeps and dreams, in the self-unconsciousness of Childhood, marvellous treasures for her adornment when she wakes are secretly accumulated and prepared by the wonder-working Power that protects her slumbers. ‘She will not sleep forever, and ere she wake From all things precious must her future crown By me be wrought.’ Then for a whole year long He suck'd the red volcanoes. Fill'd with flame, At that year's end he cut a glittering tooth. It was a garnet. ‘This tooth's hue,’ said he, ‘Hath too much smoke in it.’ So he inhaled Still for a live-long year those fervid ores Whose subterranean incandescence burns Smokeless. His next tooth was an almondine. The growing of the Dragon's teeth. ‘Already better, but too sombre still!’ He mutter'd. And for yet another year “Nothing but molten gold the Dragon drank, Save when at times, to cool his scorching throat, He sipp'd the morning and the evening dew. And so he got himself another tooth, A ruby. ‘'Twas the dew,’ he said, ‘methinks, That brighten'd this, and too much molten gold Is good for nobody. My throat is dry.’ Then in twelve gulps, that lasted each a month, The sea he swallow'd, and a fourth tooth cut. That fourth tooth was a beryl rare in hue, Aqua Marina was the name of it, And pale sea-green its colour. ‘Not so bad!’ The Dragon sigh'd, ‘But I am sea-sick now, And need a mild milk diet.’ So by night Milk in the cold light of the moon he lapp'd, And after the fifth twelvemonth he produced A fifth tooth. 'Twas an opal. Better pleased, To make adiadem for the King's Daughter, all the years of Childhood and all the influences of Nature contribute crown jewels. And the last seems ever the best. ‘Wisdom,’ he cried aloud ‘is wean'd at last! “‘One cannot live forever upon drink. Time to try these five teeth on solid food!’ And he devour'd the greenness of the earth, And got another tooth, an emerald. Then, having all devour'd, the Dragon mused, ‘Now I have nothing left to live upon But air.’ And upon air, a seventh year, full He feasted, swallowing the azure sky. His seventh tooth was a turkis; and his eighth A sapphire, by the ethereal firmament (His eighth year's nurture) colour'd. ‘One finds out By trying,’ said the Dragon, ‘many things!’ And with a flourish of his tail he flapp'd The sparkling stars down out of heaven, and laugh'd, ‘I know not yet if they will make fine teeth, But certainly these stars are good to crunch.’ Seven other teeth the stars contributed, And they were crystals, yellow, rose, and white. In its glowing consummation. ‘One trial more,’ he cried, ‘and I have done! “‘The child for fifteen years hath been asleep. The sixteenth year she will awake; and then Her crown must be completed. Let me think! The green world I have eaten bare, the sea I have drunk dry, earth's fire is finish'd up, The sky I have devour'd, the firmament, And all the stars of heaven. What's left? The sun!’ And on the sun the Dragon flung himself Hungry and fierce; and gnaw'd its burning disc So deep that he himself at last took fire, And burn'd, and burn'd, until he burn'd away The crown consumes its creator, and the Dragon's teeth are shed. Into a heap of cinders. Much too much Did he in his exorbitance attempt, And the sun slew him. But his claws had torn And ravaged it, and on its glorious orb Black spots, the traces of his teeth, remain'd. Then, when the Dragon was consumed, the child The wealth unconsciously acquired by the King's Daughter during her sleep, Awoke, and from that cavern she came forth, “Wherein she had been sleeping sixteen years. Her footstep o'er the Dragon-cinders tripp'd And stumbled, striking on the monster's jaw, So steep'd in molten gold, it had become Golden itself—a constellated crown That gleam'd with sixteen jewels. The sixteenth Was from the sun, and brightest of them all, Being a diamond.” Here, Dame Rhoda groan'd. “The child,” she said, “upon her little lap Had laid the Dragon's gift, whereon she gazed With looks of sorrowful perplexity, As though the glare of it distress'd her eyes, The weight of it her knees. Her listless hands, Around it lingering, not one effort made To lift it to her head. I would have call'd, And told her how to wear it, but alas, I could not. All at once I was aware She consciously gives away, as soon as she awakes. Of one who, clothed in white, with hooded brows, And arms in eager supplication stretch'd, “Stood near, and whisper'd to her. What was said I heard not, for whene'er I strove to scan The stranger's features down mine eyelids droop'd, And all grew dim. The last thing I beheld Was that the child her slighted crown had set On that white-hooded head. Beholding this, To whom? I cried aloud. The sound of mine own voice Awaked me. Swift the vision fled away, And from my hand the magic mirror fell.” Long had the Dame ceased speaking to the King, The King discusses the Oracle. And still the old King spake not, lost in thought. At last he lifted up his face, and said, “All these strange things are neither here nor there. The coffee-marks know, doubtless, what they mean, But the witch catch me if I understand!” “Son,” said Dame Rhoda, “it is clear as day.” But “Clear as day!” the old King grumbled, “Dame I in a dragon can see nothing clear Unless I see him on a signboard. Then 'Tis clear as day that beer and bread and cheese, With hay and straw to boot can be obtain'd By paying for them.” “Hush!” Dame Rhoda cried. And is indoctrinated by Dame Rhoda in the principles of Draconian Philosophy. “Be careful! Speak not disrespectfully Of dragons. Theirs is a mysterious race, And older is their pedigree than thine. This dragon was a dragon of good birth, And well he loved thy daughter.” “That is true,” The King mused, “and his pardon I beseech. 'Twas a good dragon. Well my child he watch'd For sixteen years, and made her a fair crown That cost him many a toothache. Heaven forbid That I should doubt all kinds of miracles Come naturally to a dragon born, For else, indeed, what good were to be got By being born a dragon? But alas, Why did the dragon burn himself to death? Had he but lived, he might have saved the child From parting with his gift before she knew The incalculable value of it. Zounds! Who was the whispering, wheedling, white-coat knave That from our daughter coax'd her crown away?” “Ah, son,” sigh'd Rhoda, “if I did but know! A doubtful character. 'Tis this that troubles me. The face was hid, The head white-hooded. I beheld no more.” “Could'st thou not from the feathers tell the bird? The King said. “Some outlandish popinjay, Most likely! Did'st thou in his aspect note No mark whereby to know the man again If thou should'st meet him?” Rhoda shook her head. “The stranger was no man,” she groan'd. “No man?” The King gasp'd. “Ah, I never thought of that! Let me reflect. No man, no son-in-law; No son-in-law, no new alliance gain'd; No heirs, no anything! What sort of age?” “Even younger than our dear one to my sight, But to my thought much older,” she replied. “It was a Russian Princess!” said the King. Whose conduct gives rise to various conjectures. “No,” said the Dame, “'twas nothing of the kind.” “White-hooded?” he went on. “It must have been An Abbess, then. Provision shall be made, In case of a minority, to guard The Crown against encroachment by the Church.” Dame Rhoda wrung her apron to a rope Between her skinny hands, and clutch'd it tight. “It was no Abess,” she exclaim'd. “Alas, It was not even a woman!” “Then,” cried he, “Why did'st thou say it was no man?” “Because No man it was,” she sigh'd. “The nondescript Was neither man nor woman.” From his pipe The King shook out the ashes, slowly rose, Paced the floor silent, hands behind him claspt, Head bent, and brows in deep reflection knit, Then, coming to a sudden halt, he said, “Dame, if thou hadst but told me this before, I could have guess'd it sooner—clear as day! It was a Knight of Malta! I'll forbid Comments, in the Imperative Mood, on irregular declensions of the Epicene Gender. Knights of that Order access to our realm, And nobody shall be allow'd to wear A Maltese cross at our Court Balls. A law Forthwith I'll make, and such a law! . . . . But 'faith, The worst of legislation, as I've found, Is that no sooner one good law is made The practical difficulties of legislation examined Than half-a-dozen others are required To undo all the mischief it has done. Until at last a law is like a door Provided with so many bolts and bars That the thief finds it far less difficult To get in by the window. That you'll see, If this intriguer be, as you suppose, Neither a man nor woman. Such a case No law has yet foreseen. A law express To meet it must immediately be made, Prohibiting attempts upon the Crown To everybody and to nobody. And that's a law that's something like a law, Or else I know not what a law is like, Who have been signing laws my whole life long! Ah, Rhoda, Rhoda, not even conjuring In reference to the administrative functions of the Crown. Is harder than the art of government! And, dear, O dear, what cleverness it needs To keep the country tolerably safe From all the clever folks in it! Dame, Dame! When I reflect that yon poor cradled babe Will some day have to govern, and I gone, That hers 'twill be to suffer in my stead The thousand headaches that crown'd heads endure, Sit without snoring at the Council Board, Sign laws that nobody can understand, And listen without yawning in his face To my long-winded Lord High Chancellor, I almost wish that they may have their will And do their worst those coffee-marks of thine, Requiescat! Letting the child sleep crownless, careless, saved From the sad toilful trouble of it all, Somewhere among the flowers, far far away!” While thus in wandering babble, vague, grotesque, Seen in its true aspect, the relation between Tradition and Monarchy is beautiful. And inconsecutive as changeful dreams, The old King half-soliloquized aloud, Dame Rhoda's face beam'd fervid, beautiful With a strange beauty not of flesh and blood. It was the mystic beauty that is born Of motherhood. Age leaves it undeform'd, Allurement to uncomeliness it gives, Bathes in enchanting light the homeliest head When o'er her babe the happy mother bends, Revives in fresh virginities of joy After time's wearying years have done their worst, Brightens the dim eye, sweetens the sour'd lip, And blooms unwither'd in the care-worn cheek When tremulous eld with blushing pride receives, Childlike itself, the grown-up child's embrace. At last she murmur'd, “What would Pilgram say?” Dame Rhoda makes a suggestion. The King's face brighten'd. “Pilgram? Ah, well thought!” He answer'd. “And methinks that here again, Dear Rhoda, from his visit to the Court Of that wild Cousin of ours, Cophetua, The Master was this evening to return. Ye two are my good angels. It is thou That warnest, he that guideth.” From its peg Forthwith his crown he hastily unhook'd With eager hand, and, as he grasp'd it, groan'd, “A Knight of Malta! after all the pains That Her Late Majesty, our sainted spouse, Took to prolong the dynasty! Farewell!” Softly the door behind the old King closed, On which the King acts. Scarce heeded by Dame Rhoda, who had turn'd To rearrange her conjuring cards; and soon Along the silence of the floors beyond The last sound of his slipper'd footstep ceased, Why, what a King is this!— Horatio. While, still perusing kings and queens and knaves, The sorceress mutter'd, “Diamonds or Hearts?” III. THE MASTER. To all the Court of Diadum well known A biographical puzzle. Was Master Pilgram, tho' by none known well. Most unobtrusive, yet a busy cause Of garrulous conjecture, both the man Himself, and his relations with the King. A man of inconspicuous aspect—garb No rank denoting, face and form no age Distinctly mark'd, nor aught exceptional About him, save perchance a mirthful eye, Unnoticeably watchful of mankind. But they who felt that eye upon them, found A lurking mystery in its merriment, A something cavernous and full of depths Wherein men's thoughts might wander and be lost. Was he of foreign birth, or native born? For both he seem'd, and yet not either quite. Had he another name, another home, Acknowledged only in some other land? Or was it here at home that his true name, From other lands returning, he avow'd? For neither here nor elsewhere stay'd he long, Yet, after his departure, never here Of his arrival elsewhere news was heard. Free from all ceremonial to the Court He came as one that uninvited comes, Secure of welcome, to a kinsman's hearth; And rather as an inmate than a guest He went, unbidden. Whither? No one knew, Nor whence he came. An unsolved problem he, Like Gaspar Hauser, or the Iron Mask: For all the Nestors or the Court averr'd That there they knew him when they still were boys, Before His Majesty the present King Succeeded to the sceptre of his sire. And, tho' nigh threescore years must have elapsed Since Pilgram, now the son's familiar friend, Was then the father's, yet they all agreed That no whit older now than then he seem'd, Who neither then nor now seemed old or young. And in those days he made the little Prince The Wooden Horse of Diadum, A pretty horse; a hobby-horse of wood, But cleverer far than any common horse Of flesh and blood. This horse could gallop, trot, Pace, amble, canter, jump, and make the volt, The demivolt, the virevolt, the passade And repassade, the repollon, courbette, And falcade. And not only all these tricks The wooden horse could perfectly perform, But he perform'd them to appropriate strains Of pleasing military music, play'd In his own belly. Later, when the crown Of his departed sire the Prince assumed, His first act was to publish a decree Proclaiming that the tune of Old King Cole, To which his hobby gallop'd, was henceforth The royal anthem. He at the same time Forbade that revolutionary air Of Cherry Ripe. This wise precaution saved The country from incalculable ills. But Diadummiania's Wooden Horse, Its chief exploit as beneficent as that of the Wooden Horse of Troy was the reverse. Unlike its treacherous Trojan prototype, Rescued, instead of ruining, the walls That lodged it. For one night, when Diadum Was fast asleep, a sudden chime of bells Rang curfew from the belly of the Horse, And roused the sleepers just in time to see That portion of the palace was on fire, Wherein His Royal Highness the Crown Prince, And all his gentlemen in waiting, slept. The Master of the Ceremonies then A great Court Ceremony. Immediately got printed, and sent round, The proper invitation-cards to all The Privy Councillors and Chamberlains, The foreign Envoys and Ambassadors, And those distinguish'd strangers who had been Presented at the Court of Diadum, To attend the Conflagration. Gentlemen Without their collars—undress uniform Ladies without their trains—demi-toilette. All who received His Majesty's commands Order of Official Precedence. To be in waiting at the Burning-Down Were to be saved in order of Court Rank: The Diplomatic Body first, and then The Hereditary Mistress of the Robes And the Grand Marshal; after these, in turn, The Privy Councillors and Chamberlains, Each Chamberlain according to the date Of his appointment, and the rules prescribed For such Court ceremonies by the code Of Diadummianian Etiquette. The Royal Family and all the Court, Disappearance of the Wooden Horse. Thanks to the Wooden Horse, were thus preserved, But the poor Wooden Horse himself was burnt. He to his fate with dignity succumb'd; And 'twas a touching spectacle to see That noble animal performing all His volts and demivolts and repollons Among the roaring flames, wherein at last He perish'd to the tune of Old King Cole. In Diadum, however, a belief The surviving legend. Prevail'd that nothing did, or could, destroy Pilgram's imperishable palfrey. Folks There were, who deem'd this horse would reappear, As it had disappear'd, in some strange way When least expected; just as boors in France Believe the first Napoleon still alive, And in a British dungeon. Not a few Had grandmothers accustom'd to relate That they were girls the night of that great fire, And that they well remember'd having seen Distinctly thro' its flame and smoke the form Of Master Pilgram. He was sauntering slow Along the bright edge of a burning beam, And whistling Old King Cole. The palfrey neigh'd, And, trotting to him, nosed his pocket. He A lump of sugar from that pocket drew, Gave it the nag, its neck and nose caress'd, Lengthen'd the stirrup-leathers (for this steed Stood always ready-saddled in its stall) And mounted leisurely, with graceful bows Saluting the assembled crowds below. Then, as the last red rafter tumbled in, Both horse and rider rose up into heaven, Majestic, musical, magnificent, Among the rising sparks, and reach'd the stars. This story is improbable. There is no mention of the alleged circumstances in Dr. Kepler's Report of 1613 to the Diet of Ratisbon. Kepler's silence about them is most significant; for it is unlikely that any serious disturbance of the Zodiac should have escaped the notice of an astronomer who may be said to have passed his life among the stars. Consult the Kepler MSS. in the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg. It will also be observed that the extraordinary distance here attributed to the motions of Master Pilgram's body is represented as having greatly increased their general attractiveness. This would seem to be incompatible with the law established by Newton, that the attractive property of bodies is diminished in proportion to the squares of their distances. The event, however, might have happened before Newton's time, and consequently previous to the establishment of that law. There still distinguishable for a while Was Master Pilgram. Up the Zodiac He canter'd at his customary pace, Chatted with Sagittarius on the road, And then alighted at the Golden Ram, A well-known tavern on the Milky Way, Whose barmaid was Astræa. Forth she came, A fresh-brew'd foaming flagon in her hand, To welcome Master Pilgram. But meanwhile Leda's twin boys, incorrigible brats Brimful of mischief, playing on the path, Let off a comet. That celestial squib Frighten'd the Wooden Horse, and fast away He gallop'd down the Ecliptic. Pilgram tried To catch him by the tail, but in mistake It was the comet's tail he caught, and swift Both Pilgram and the comet disappear'd. Since then, for many and many a year, no more Of Pilgram or his palfry had been seen In Diadummiania. Men said, “What wonder? Nobody, once gone so far, Comes back so soon. Such journeys are not made In four-and-twenty hours.” As time went by, However, when the sexton's spade had stopp'd Growth of Scepticism. The mouth of each eye-witness with a pinch Of graveyard dust, the occurrence of these facts Some persons openly denied. But then, They were not present when the facts occurr'd, And that makes a great difference. Prudent folks, Recognized imprudence of disturbing established beliefs. Content with the innocuous privilege Of private doubt, due public deference paid To the tradition of the Flying Horse; Knowing that they no truer story knew, To substitute for its surmised untruth, And feeling that society itself Is but a well-dress'd fiction. Science sought First attempts at a scientific treatment of the subject-matter of traditional belief. To reconcile the rumour'd miracle With natural causes, by explaining how Mere heat might naturally move the springs Of an automaton, mere natural smoke Assume the semblance of a horse in heaven. But, getting not a “Thank-you” for attempts Final attitude of Science. At thus reducing everything to smoke, Science herself, on second thoughts, dismiss'd The smoke-hypothesis, with all the rest, As quite unscientific. This confirm'd Its effect upon the general body of opinion; to which it leaves no alternative between unreserved denial of the recorded phenomena, and unreserved acquiescence in the original explanation of them. The popular belief in the event As a true miracle; since Science fail'd To prove it possible by any means That were not obviously miraculous. The wisest Diadummianians held That in a certain sense the tale was true, Tho' in a certain other sense 'twas false. Belief and Scepticism reconciled by the Historical Method. The facts alleged were unbelievable, But what of that? Those facts had been believed, Were still believed, by multitudes of men Whom there was every reason to believe Sincere believers in their own belief. That this belief existed was a fact, Proving the facts believed to have at least Believable existence—not indeed In Natural History, that rejected them As neither natural nor historical, But in the History of the Human Mind, That recognised them and explain'd them all As well-attested actual results Of the mind's human character. Dislike Of negative bare ignorance sufficed To endear the story to the common crowd; The ethical and æsthetical sides of the question. And thoughtful minds found much in it to praise. The tale was pretty, elevating too; For to the stars it lifted up men's hearts, And show'd them there bright images, beyond Disaster and destruction here on earth. Thus, Philosophical Sagacity With popular Simplicity combined To keep the story of the Flying Horse Respected, save by those who were themselves Persons of no respectability. But of its most convinced believers each Believed it in a somewhat different way; And thus, not only did as many tales Variations, Concerning Master Pilgram go about In Diadummiania as mouths There were to tell them, or as ears to hear, But also of the meaning of those tales, Their cause and character and origin, There were as many theories afoot As fashions in Philosophy there be. Such was the man, and such the counsellor, The King consults Master Pilgram. King Diadummianus, when he left Dame Rhoda, sought, and in his chamber found. The Master, with a pencil in one hand, A palette in the other, musing stood Before a canvas he had vaguely stain'd With streaks and spots of colour that composed No picture—or, if any, such alone As those that sometimes on a winter night Among the husht hearth's embers half abuse A sick man's fancy ere he falls asleep. But when the King (save by his own remarks Uninterrupted) reach'd his story's end, Prodigious was his wonder to behold On Pilgram's canvas all the tale portray'd, An unfinished picture, He had been pouring into Pilgram's ear. Those streaks and spots, by unperceived degrees, Were grown beneath the Master's hovering hand Into a picture of Dame Rhoda's dream. Calm in her guarded cavern slept the child, The sleepless Dragon by the sleeper crouch'd, And glorious in the darkness glow'd the crown. Anon, the pencil o'er the picture swept, And all its outlines, fading fast, relapsed Into mere unintelligible tints. “Stay!” cried the King. “Ah, why so soon dissolved Thy picture, like the vision it recall'd, Just at the moment when they both began To awaken curiosity?” “Because,” The Master answer'd, “both were prophecies Of perils that perchance may ne'er assume Distincter aspect.” Then did he unfold Pilgram confides his project to the King. A plan by his ingenious wits devised To counteract those perils. Hugely pleased, The King together rubb'd his palms and cried, “Çaira!” When, moreover, the next day His Council was engaged in drafting laws Strange be haviour of His Majesty. On lunacy, the King continued still Rubbing his hands, and chuckling to himself “Çaira!” As they left the Council Board, The Ministers of one another ask'd, “What was the matter with His Majesty? The King to-day was quite unlike himself; Can there be something in his mind? From whom Could he have caught that odd outlandish oath, Çaira?” “From a lunatic, no doubt!” The Chancellor said grimly. Those two words, A curious philological detail. Çaira (which were gibberish, in fact, Invented by the King in such a mood As makes fond mothers mumble to their babes All kinds of merry nonsense) by and by The round of Custom ran till they became A popular expression. First of all, Like other fooleries, they had their vogue In upper circles, and were Shibboleths Of fashionable intercourse awhile; But after the Fine World had worn them out, The Common People used them, to imply A foolish sort of self-complacency. This is the unsuspected origin Of that famed phrase, Çaira: and it shows That revolution-mongers, even in France, Talk nonsense sometimes without knowing it. 'Twas in the full-grown blossom of the year, The King's excursion And day was dawning over Diadum, When forth the King with Master Pilgram stole. Unwitness'd thro' the silent town they went, And past its seaward suburbs, till they reach'd A grassy path by bramble roses paved Off the beaten track. With fallen petals. It was known to none Save Pilgram, and its first discoverer rash; A little rillet of hill-water sweet That down it with a child's impatience ran To taste the bitter salt of the great sea. Here, under hiding boughs, by hedges green, Till grass and moss and flower gave way to sand And shell and shingle, the companions pass'd Out on the sudden beach of a small bay That from the overhanging cliffs above His Majesty goes a-fishing. Look'd inaccessible. There, Pilgram loosed The rope that tether'd to a tiny creek A slender pinnace. Quick the King and he Into the pinnace stept, and push'd from shore. Safely her course their little vessel held Across a treacherous sea thick sown with reefs In troubled waters. And sunken rocks. From the high downs above Shepherds this embarcation wondering watch'd. Never before had fisher moor'd his skiff In that lone bay, nor ever pilot steer'd His bark unbroken o'er those sunken rocks, Whither the pinnace speeded fast. For there A shoreless, steep, surf-beaten island rose, About whose barren crags and perilous creek No living thing found shelter, tho' it stood Scarce farther from the mainland than perchance Nearness of the Unknown. A bolt might reach when thro' barbarian seas The Balearic pirate chased some bark For Carthage bound. And on the seaman's chart That unapproachable island's evil name Was Isle Forever more-be-lost-to-sight. The shepherds recognized His Majesty What was said of the King's sport by those who looked down on it. And Master Pilgram. And they shook their heads, Saying, “A fisherman's a fisherman, A fish a fish. A king should be a king. The fisherman, to gain his livelihood, Must daily go to sea and risk his life. The king, who hath no livelihood to gain, Can daily stay at home without a risk, And comfortably dine upon the fish The fisherman hath risk'd his life to catch. But no! Great folks, not satisfied forsooth To eat, when they can have it without pains, The meat that poor folks take such pains to get, Must needs, because there is no need at all, Make show with rod and line or dog and gun Of catching it and killing it themselves. And all that needless trouble they call sport.” Thus to each other did those shepherds speak, As sages do, whenever sages deign To speak of follies that are not their own. But back at moonrise Pilgram and the King Came safely, bringing with them, still alive, The King has something to show for his trouble. A monstrous lobster that His Majesty Had deign'd to catch. Within the palace-porch The two friends parted, and the King regain'd The Royal Nursery. Its Baby Queen Was sleeping. By her side Dame Rhoda watch'd Father and child.— The grey-hair'd father to the cradle crept Softly, and bent above it. When he rose, A trembling gem of purest water gleam'd Upon the forehead of the child. Anon The monarch at the moonlit casement stood, Musing. Between the palace and the sea The royal city adown the hillside humm'd With human mutterings multitudinous, And twinkled with innumerable lamps. Beyond it, like a battlement, uprose The dark broad sea; and the large moon let down Over that battlement a ladder of light For wishes to climb heavenward, or perchance For earthward-faring angels to descend. “Pilgram,” the old man murmur'd as he mused, Good night, sweet Prince!— Horatio. “I would that I might sleep and dream unwaked Till dawns the destin'd hour of thy return!” IV. THE ISLAND. Pilgram upon the morrow from the Court Pilgram in partibus. Departed, and with him July; nor back, Until July was come again, came he. But all the months between, while far away They deem'd him, close at hand the Master dwelt In that wild island to whose shore morose His sorcery safe across the perilous straits Had piloted the King. There, all unseen, Builders from afar. A troop he landed of white-turban'd folk With dusky faces; cunning artisans, Masons and carpenters, expert as those Who came on floats to Joppa from afar, And builded Bathshua's mysterious son A house of glory for his sacred feasts, His solemn sabbaths, and his glad new moons. At midnight underneath a moonless sky The better side. These strangers, led by Pilgram, disembark'd Where, in a hidden bight, the savage coast Changed, as a Sea-Hag in her secret cave To a young Siren changes, and disclosed, Voluptuously loose from all restraint, Soft undulating slopes and dimpled nests Of naked loveliness. For, like the moon, That never yet to mortal eyes reveal'd That unimaginable hemisphere She turns from earth, the self-secluding isle, Seen from the mainland, not a glimpse vouchsafed Of its evasive witcheries. But here, Wall'd from the rancorous North and warping East By spacious solitudes of mountain snow, One glowing inlet to the warm South-West Lay open, husht in whose luxuriant lap A land of unsuspected beauty smiled. A virgin soil. Thick-heap'd about it gleaming gorges hung Purpureal woods, that droop'd beneath their load Of leafage by a windless heaven unheaved, And loose from branch to branch along them roam'd The labyrinthine rose. Its meadowy dales A thousand fragrant suspirations fill'd With incense breathing from the blossom-dust Dropt by a thousand summers in a soil Of germinating spices. The light down Of feathery seeds, the flash of insect wings, The thin ethereal shapes of hovering shade That over luminous uplands track'd the course Of clouds and great wild birds, were all day long Sole travellers of the indolent solitude: And not a sound its fervid stillness search'd Save the low murmuring bee's long mellow hum, Or, phantom-echo'd from afar, the shout Of waters falling into shadowy glens. Light task it was in this delicious land, The beginning of a Ballad. Where Nature laughing led the steps of Art, For Master Pilgram's well-equipp'd adepts (Shaping to their fantastical design The tassel'd precipices from whose tops Long trailers of rich-hued convolvolus stream'd, Enwoven with twining bryony) to uprear A fabric fair as any elfin bower That hides some happy secret from the world. Fair as an elfin bower they built it high Among the lonely hills, and hard to find As that sleep-haunted palace, overgrown With bramble-blooms; where, lull'd (so legends tell) In slumber pure, a maiden princess dreams Of promised happiness, nor, dreaming, knows That dreams of promised happiness, alas, Are happier far than happiness itself. A coil of glittering cliffs, that seaward shone In the clear azure ripple of a still bay Reflected, branching inland brokenly, And there asunder scoop'd by the prone stress Of a precipitous stream, on either side The river'd glen, like giant gateways, rear'd Steep crags abrupt that, slanting as they rose Towards each other, strove to reunite, And almost touch'd at the top. Here Pilgram camp'd The Imagination creates not. It does but transform the materials furnished by Nature for the manifestation of its force; imparting to them new aspects, a new significance, and new relation to the human world. About the brambly boulders of the gorge, Skirting its torrent's stony tract, his troops Of wizard craftsmen. Here their water-wheels, Shrouded in veils of rainbow'd mist, revolved Laborious, here their forges flamed, and here Their ladder'd scaffolds swarm'd, as high in heaven, From the rough mountain ridge hewn mountainous, A towery pile these mystic masons wrought: A pile whose glimmering battlements appear'd Half cloud, half crag; and, tho' but freshly built All indistinguishable from the grey Old parent rock's self, cloth'd in the wan hues Of distance, and the mystery of the hills; Like some ancestral portrait of a child With infant features in a garb antique. For now the old time was young; and, as in bud White tho' unwither'd is the hawthorn's head, So here did youth and age one aspect wear, Blent in the hoary blossom of the past. Gardens and bowers between the winding walls Of that aërial labyrinth hidden, or hung On terraced platforms purpling golden heights, They planted; and the wandering water-springs And courses channell'd into shadowy wells. Reachless upon the seaward side of them Were both the palace and the crags it crown'd; But inland, down by wooded slopes unseen, The dim meanderings of a sylvan path Led softly from the summit to the glen. A twelve month's task this wondrous work had been To Pilgram's ministrant adepts; and now The productions of Phantasos would remain unknown and profitless, were he not Craftsman as well as Seer, and in both capacities master of all arts. But the service of the higher faculties employed by him in the roughshaping of his work is not required for the finishing touches which render that work accessible to those for whose benefit it is destined; these last being mainly mechanical. The pile was perfect, and they all were gone, By night embarking, back to their own lands. Yet still, alone, he linger'd in the isle, Still roam'd, companionless, from room to room The wild fantastic palace he had built, And haunted still its blossomy terraces, Returning ever to what seem'd the mouth Of some huge well-shaft in the central court. A monstrous cavity it was, that gaped Into a gulf of gloom unfathomable, Girt by a marble parapet, beneath A penthouse roof with signs zodiacal Emblazon'd, on twelve porphyry columns propp'd, Each column carven rough with shapes grotesque Of beast, and bird, and blossom. Here longwhile Was Pilgram busied, with ingenious hand Adjusting pulleys, winches, levers, wheels, And cordage. Would ye know the reason why? Come, then, whoever fears not to pursue, Where'er they lead, the footsteps of a guide Whose ways are variable as the winds, And never long upon the beaten track! Come to the sleeping-chamber of the King By Pilgram loved! A King whose countenance, The last of the Ballad Kings. Discourse, and conduct, all alike inspire Complete conviction that his honest throne He never could have owed to any cause Less irreproachable than being born The only heir to it. But haste! for Time, That unreturning traveller, hurries on, Soon leaving far behind him out of reach Old kings, old kingdoms, and old kingliness. King Diadummianus is the last Of all his dynasty, and nevermore May modern verse his royal rest invade. It was the hour when, nodding on his watch, The King's dream. The startled sentinel hears the vigilant cry That shamed repentant Peter. Night wax'd pale, And still the monarch slept. Yet slept he not Ungarmented on his accustom'd couch, But full-dress'd, sitting in the regal chair Where sleep had slid upon him. Round about, The candles, to their silver sockets sunk, With sooty wicks untrimm'd, and long white beards Of wandering wax, burn'd wan. The old King dream'd That he was going to a Gala Ball, Given by His Majesty King Solomon To meet the Queen of Sheba and the Kings Of Garamant and Nasamonia. He had bespoken for this great event A new court-suit, and it surprised him much To find that monstrous lobster, he had caught And supp'd upon twelve months ago, was turn'd Into his tailor. The smooth garden-sward This creature with its nippers snipp'd like cloth. The coat is cut according to the cloth. “Ho, thou crustaceous rascal!” roar'd the King, “Who bade thee spoil our palace-lawn, to make A court-suit fitter for field mice and moles Than monarchs? Would'st thou ruin utterly Our credit with our cousin Solomon? That Prince of Jews, were we so ill endorsed, A disputed endorsement. Would certainly dishonour us, and we (Dread thought!) might have no friend in Jewry left.” “Fear nothing, Sire!” The lobster-tailor laugh'd. “This stuff is velvet-smooth, of finest nap, True Elbœuf texture, all pure bottle-green. Deign, Sire, to stretch apart thy royal legs, That I may measure to a nicety The sinus of the crural angle. Thanks! Alas, since that mischance which brought to shame His Rhodian Royal Highness—my revered Old client, the Colossus, whose court-tights Crack'd at an angle of four-score degrees And ten—one cannot be too careful. Hic Rhodus, hic salta!” With malignant smile, As thus he spake, the mocking monster slid Insidiously, between the royal legs, His back perfidious and impervious, horsed The dish runs away with the spoon. The monarch on it, and full-speed began A backward march down hill precipitous To where the plunging billow bruised the beach. What might have happen'd to His Majesty Not even he who tells this tale can guess, If old Dame Rhoda, who was looking out From Pilgram's casement, had not chanced to spy Her Sovereign's peril. Pilgram's inkstand stood, A quiver full of pens, upon his desk. Pens, penknife, inkstand, all, Dame Rhoda seized, And hurl'd them at that treacherous lobster's head. No sooner did the inkstand find itself Launch'd into space (its natural element) An inkstand takes flight, Than it became a great black crow. The pens Spread out their feather'd crow-quills, and were wings. The pointed penknife was the bird's keen beak; Wherewith it dealt the lobster such a stab As slew that monster indigestible; Who, muttering “Malediction! Mayonaise! And Tartar Sauce!” expired. “Quick!” croak'd the crow, And carries away the Monarchy: “Sire, art thou ready? There's no time to lose.” Forthwith, upon the sable bird astride, The King beheld his Kingdom fade, and heard The crow-quills round him talking to themselves. “What will become of us?” they ask'd. “No good,” Which, after being made the subject of animated debate, Replied the penknife. “You inquisitive quills, Forever asking questions, why such haste To get you know not where? Of this be sure! When steel and pen are into contact come, Things must return to what they were before By a short cut. And it is thus alone The King can to his Kingdom be restored.” “Pooh!” said a pen, “the King must first consent To be a piece of paper.” “Small the chance Of such consent!” the penknife cried. “Pert pen, What king would ever of his own accord Become a charter?” “That's prejudice,” The pen retorted. “I know how to slip A little sentence in, that shall reduce The whole to nothing.” “What will it contain?” Enquired the penknife. And the pen replied, “A simple formula. The Royal Oath. His Majesty anon must condescend To swear it by the father of his sires, The founder of his dynasty, whose name Is known to none, not even to himself: But I, who may not tell it, know that name Is graved on his ancestral sepulchre.” “Caw!” said the swarthy fowl, and swifter flapp'd With her funereal pinion the void air, “We seek that sepulchre.” This dreadful talk Of charters, and the sepulchres of kings, And royal oaths, deplorably confused His Diadummianian Majesty; Who, in the increasing jumble of his dream (A monarch's nightmare), vaguely felt himself Assumes a constitutional character. Changed by degrees into a plain white sheet Of paper. On that sheet of paper white The pen, that knew it, wrote the history Of all his race from the remotest time; And then, to illustrate those annals, drew The mausoleum of his ancestor, Capricius the Magnificent. But there, An incomplete historical record. By some misgiving seized (some sense perchance Of secret fear by that great name inspired, Even when 'twas only copied from a tomb) The pen, till then so overweening, slipp'd, And down fell an obliterating blot. This slur upon his sepulchre displeased The great dead Sovereign, who indignant rose, And shook the doorjambs of his tomb. Up sprang The startled dreamer, shuddering, and beheld, Not the entomb'd forefather of his race, But Pilgram, who, with torch in hand, exclaim'd, The Author of this Drama appears upon the stage. “Sire, art thou ready? There's no time to lose.” “Why, that's what said thine inkstand,” gasp'd the King, Still half awake, “and then became a crow.” “Sire, from an inkstand,” Master Pilgram sigh'd, “Expect no reasonable speech. But come, For all is finisht!” “Ah,” the King replied, “True to the destin'd hour dost thou return, And is warmly welcomed. Nor ever hast thou fail'd thy promised word, But O the long, long time without a sign! Not that for even a moment of it all Have I once doubted thee! To doubt thy truth, Thy love, thy power, thy deep beneficence, That would be death—the death of all things dear, And fair, and sweet, the death of life's best life! Lead on, then, trusted Master! Led by thee My guide I know, nor fear the unknown path.” The Master stoop'd. A lingering hand he laid Upon the old King's shoulder, father-like, And answer'd, (it was all he answer'd him) “Even so, dear child!” What was it, then, the bond Pilgram is discovered to be an old acquaintance. That thus to one another bound these two As child to father—this old homely King, So hoary-headed yet so young at heart, Nor all unwise in his simplicity, And that mysterious guardian of the hopes Of all his house? It was the bond, vouchsafed To every unsophisticated soul, Of human intercourse with one humane Tho' wonder-working god, who in disguise After the cteparture of the gods (vide Legend) one remained: and still he haunts this earth, though in disguise. Rather than relinquish the amusement of intercourse with mankind, this capricious Deity hath accommodated his character to the conditions of every religion. His fellow Deities called him Phantasos: Dame Rhoda christened him Pilgram; he hath many another name. For he travels through the ages, taking here and there the name of this man or of that, as princes take the names of their subjects when they go abroad. And, although by his works only shall you know him, yet he leaveth to others the glory or the shame of them. He it is who taught the Sirens the songs they sang to Ulysses, and made Mercutio acquainted with Queen Mab. Led by him, Alexander invaded the East, and Columbus discovered the West. He was the first Free Mason, the architect of Solomon's Temple, and hath left the trace of his handiwork among the shrines of Christendom, and the minarets of Islam. The Playhouse was once his favourite resort. Now he is oftener to be found in the Madhouse. Sometimes graceful, sometimes grotesque, at one while sublime, at another absurd, his form is never twice the same. Many are mystified by his antics, and exasperated by his whims. But to all who recognise its divinity, his presence imparts freedom and joy. Still haunts this earth, and still with men consorts; Perplexing those that recognise him not, But helping all who in his power confide. A god whose patient goodness unfatigued Forsakes not even frivolity: a god Whose presence gives a charm to things grotesque, A grace to things ungainly, and imparts To common things a mystery from afar, To things mysterious a familiar tone That turns even terror to delight: a god Whose unacknowledged influence all creeds Have cause to cherish, for his smile makes fair The rudest fanes, and sweet the harshest faiths, And tender the austerest rites, and glad The gloomiest mythologies of man, Whose mind mistrusts the little that he knows, And fears the much he knows not. Thou thyself, Brother or Sister, hast thou never felt, In doubt, discouragement, and lassitude, Thy spirit guided by a hidden hand Far from the close yet unfamiliar crowd To lonely places sweet as home regain'd After long homesick exile,—wild sea shores, Deep forest glens, or visionary hills? There, to the vocal silence listening rapt, Hast thou not heard a voice that with thy soul Spake clearly, and gone comforted away? 'Tis Pilgram's hand that drew thee: Pilgram's voice That hail'd thee: Pilgram's presence that reveal'd In those rare moments memorable proofs Of the mistrusted immortality Of his own godhood. It is Pilgram's self That, when thy hope is low, thy heart oppress'd, And on it heavily weighs this weary world, Doth loosen life's intolerable load, And lift thee as a father his sick child. The King his guide had follow'd, and they stood Pilgram's lodging in the palace of Diadum, and its furniture, Within the Master's chamber. Cramm'd it was With quaint contrivances of curious art: Porcelain pagodas, on whose mimic shrines A puppet Bonze burn'd incense: tuneful clocks Cluster'd with orbs that, turning, told the time: Chess-boards whose ivory-carven chivalry Battled unbidden, fierce as Norman Knights: Small silver bells, set ringing in a row By sparks of fluid fire: fantastic founts That, spouting perfumes, spun and poised a swarm Of tiny balls, like Indian jugglers: birds With jewell'd bosoms and mechanic wings, That soar'd like larks and sang like nightingales: And companies of dancing dolls, that duck'd And curtsied quite as cleverly as lords And ladies who have pass'd their lives at Court. A trapdoor, touch'd by Pilgram in the floor, Falling, reveal'd steep flinty stairs that curl'd The secret path, and wonders by the way. Down to a subterranean gallery, dark And still as the sepulchral chrysalis Whence the tranced worm emerges a wing'd moth. Below the base of the laborious sea And through the secret stithies and ribb'd cells Where Nature's hidden toil strange treasure stores Up from this low world's many-footed life That undiscoverable gallery led To light ethereal and a land divine. Along its darkness, guided by the glare Of Pilgram's smoky torch, the King and he Reach'd a vast cavern, crystal-crusted all By hands not human, when the dædal orb Of earth was still unfinisht. All around, Into the rocky walls fast riveted, Or hanging from the hollow cupola, Branch'd clusters of colossal cressets. These The Master kindled; and forthwith to light Leapt all the splendid crystals of the cave, In flashing jets of jewel-colour'd flame; Emerald, ruby, sapphire, diamond, each Swift response to the other's signal fires In rival hues returning. The King gazed With dazzled eyes on that wild revelry Of radiances, and Pilgram murmur'd, “Yes! Pilgram explains things in his own way, These are the frozen tears of Earth's remorse For a too-late repented wrong. They glow Responsive only to a god's regard; But from the gaze of that offended god Earth hides them, knowing that he still resents Her blind rejection of his mother's prayer. She was great Saturn's daughter, and her name Latona. Flying from her serpent-foe, The pregnant goddess in her pangs appeal'd To Earth for refuge, but appeal'd in vain. Delos, the gift of Ocean, not of Earth, Was the god's birthplace, Zeus his sire, and him Men call'd Apollo. Friends were we: and here Which is the round about On earth he, too, in human garb disguised, The homes of men once haunted, shepherding way of a story-teller. Herds for Admetus in the days of old. Earth for the loss of him these tears hath wept, Rubies, and emeralds, and diamonds; And 'tis to lure him back she turns to heaven Those starry eyes of hers that men call flowers, With looks that kindle in the rose, and droop Dim with love-languors in the violet. But he forgives not, and her tears she hides: Down from the roses in her bosom drop Rubies, and from the lilies diamonds, down Drop sapphires from the violets, and from all Her other eyes, whose leafèd lids young Spring, Sighing, breathes open, the green emeralds come.” Thus murmur'd Pilgram; and the sea, that roll'd Its restless waters o'er that cavern's roof, Mingled low moanings with his murmur'd words. “Pilgram,” the King said timidly, “I know And the King understands That I shall never, never understand The things thou speakest of. To thee, indeed, them in his way; Are all things known, and I am ignorant. But yet to hear thee is my happiness; And I believe thee, tho' I know full well Apollo, whom thou bid'st me deem thy friend, Is but a statue which the gardeners place In gardens to look pretty. What of that? I know not even how the sun contrives To keep itself in heaven without a nail To hang on. But I love to feel its rays; Which is short and easy; And, if I could, I would not hear explain'd The secret of its radiance and its warmth. It is so pleasant and so full of peace To feel, as I do when I have thee near, Perfectly happy, with a happiness Inexplicably natural, and free From every care to know the reason why.” Pilgram smiled silently, and sign'd the King To follow. The two friends their march resumed. The gallery ended in the mason'd base Of a deep well-shaft, that was waterless. Here hung a bucket, balanced on a cord. This, Master Pilgram enter'd; placed the King Beside him; press'd a spring; and up they rose From darkness into twilight, and still up From twilight into daylight, till at last Out of that cavern in the central court They enter the Happy Island, Of Pilgram's island-palace they emerged, And from its flowery terraces beheld The azure-bosom'd paradise beneath. “O Pilgram, Pilgram!” cried the glad old King, Half laughing and half weeping, “and 'tis here That she will dwell? Shut from the unkind world, Fresh as to-morrow in a lover's dream, Safer than Summer in the buds unborn! And this enchanting realm I owe to thee!” Here utterance fail'd him, and with humid eyes And are glad. And open mouth, like a delighted child, He gazed around him, then on Pilgram's breast Sank with a sudden inarticulate sob, The grateful outburst of a joy surcharged. And Master Pilgram, silent also, seem'd Contented with no richer recompense To what issue will this come?— Horatio. For all his twelvemonth's toil, than to behold The childlike gladness of this grey old man. V. THE PRINCIPLE. His sullen island's unapproachable Pilgram's Policy. Lone Eden, the wild palace he had built Among its sea-girt bowers, the secret way Known to him only and the grateful King; All these were part and parcel of the plan Devised by Master Pilgram to avert The fates foreshadow'd in Dame Rhoda's dream, And save the Princess from the prophecy. Unless, indeed, the prophecy had been, To serve his purpose, by himself inspired; As Opposition Orators predict Public catastrophes their private plots Are moving heaven and earth to bring about. But Pilgram's crafty scheme to save the Crown From coming perils, by removing thus Its infant heiress from her royal home, Had naught in common with the passive faith Of fugitive princes. They from safe retreats Serenely watch the growth from bad to worse Of ills that trouble their relinquisht realms; Hoping that multitudinous mistake, The Revolution, in some final fit Of folly may recall them to their thrones. Pilgram, however, a distinction drew Between a mousetrap and a monarchy. A mouse can get with ease into the trap That's baited for him by his greediness; But a hard matter for the mouse it is, Once in it, to get out. Just otherwise, A king can from his kingdom get away, If ill at ease there; but, once out of it, Full hard he finds it to get in again. That fact in natural history was well known To Master Pilgram: and to counteract Its indicated danger, he employ'd A waxen puppet wonderfully made, And by its author call'd ‘The Principle.’ The Principle of it. This puppet was a masterpiece of art, Deceptively resembling to a hair The Princess Diadema. No mere daub'd And undeceiving mimicry of life, Such as the bouncing showman's brazen trump Bids gaping crowds about his booth admire; But free from all defects of flesh and blood, A faultless fiction that improved on truth. Obedient to innumerable wheels And pulleys in its little bust contain'd, The Puppet Princess breathed and moved about With such a natural grace, it rather seem'd The ideal than the copy of that correct Assemblage of complete accomplishments, A well-brought-up young lady. Safe henceforth The secret of the living Princess slept In her well-made well-managed counterpart, On one condition—Courtly Etiquette. This at a salutary distance keeps The curious crowd. And all in unison With Courtly Etiquette was every line And movement of the delicate machine By Pilgram call'd ‘The Principle.’ “For, Sire, The preservation of the State,” said he, Which is both Conservative “Depends upon the principle imposed By state-craft on the popular belief. Keep that unquestion'd, and the Crown is safe.” And, knowing that in all Progressive States Principles must from time to time be changed, Or rather say developed, he had made And Progressive Provision for each morphologic phase Of his elastic doll's expanding form. For its fine clockwork, when adroitly set, Could to the size and shape of it impart The appropriate appearances of growth; From tenderest infancy to that sweet age More tender still, that brings the blushing dawn Of conscious beauty to the maiden's cheek. This done, 'twas only needed to supply The necessary quantity of heads To suit the growing torse; and when the scale Was properly adjusted, and the wheels Wound up, the Pseudo-Princess would assume Whatever age her maker pleased, from Six To Sixteen. Neatly number'd One, Two, Three, Et cætera, this Puppet of the State Was furnish'd, like a scientific code, With numerous headings. And the King's delight It contributes to the felicity of the monarchy. Was in those waxen mirrors to admire His daughter's future face—now pursed and arch With playful childhood's mock importance, now A pensive maiden's with mysterious airs, Demure as May's first bashful rose—while she, The little living Princess, all the while Lay looking at him with the wistful eyes Wherethro' astonisht Infancy beholds Its unaccustom'd earthly home, and smiles On all alike, indifferently pleased And puzzled by a poodle or a judge. So Master Pilgram, in his private hours, To please the monarch made that puppet fair Change face more often than the fitful moon. When in her seeming sixteenth summer moved The mimic maiden, with paternal pride The old King made his most majestic bow, But between Public Principle Sedately turning touch'd with courtly kiss The waxen fingers, and in measured speech His model heiress gallantly address'd; Then, chuckling, o'er the cradle stoop'd, and cried, “Come! See thy pretty self as thou shalt be, My little Queen!” But when the child stretch'd out Her tiny hands, and crow'd towards the form Of her own future, all the father's heart Was fill'd with fear. He caught her in his arms, And murmur'd o'er her treasured head, “No! no! And Private Affection, Stay as thou art! For ever as thou art, The darling of mine undetected joy! Never become a coroneted doll, With studied mien from hour to hour made up: One set of graces for the Promenade, Another for the Banquet-hall prepared, These serious looks for the Te Deum learn'd, And those becoming simpers for the ball!” Such outbursts of a passion fresh and strong, And unfamiliar to that monarch old As her first love to some bewilder'd maid, Left him abasht; and with embarrass'd smile The King's mind is sometimes distracted. He said to Pilgram, “He that talks with babes Must needs talk nonsense. Doth the Council wait?” With due publicity The Principle Popularity of the Principle Day after day, at regulated times, Held by Dame Rhoda in a coach and six, Was promenaded all about the town. Later, the little puppet as it pass'd Saluted gracefully with head and hand Its loyal folk; who found the Princess grown, And said, “How well Her Royal Highness looks! So like already to the Queen deceased!” The affair, however, was more difficult When her sixth year the Princess had attain'd. For then the establish'd custom of the Court Prescribed that all the children of like age, If born with more than thirty quarterings, Should be invited upon certain days To play with the Crown Princess. In the name Secured by reform of the Ancien Régime. Of Progress (that progressively deprives Some one of something previously enjoy'd) This custom Pilgram prudently suppress'd. 'Tis easy to deceive diplomatists, For they, indeed, are train'd to be deceived; And what would be the use to some of them Of their finessing, if it did not dupe The deep credulity of all the rest? But children have a sense intuitive Of what is natural and what is not, And quicker do they recognize a doll Than train'd diplomatists a man. Meanwhile, Since Diadema's childhood first assumed Serene dominion o'er its island realm, The world was ten years older, and thereby Entitled to be ten times wiser too. The King convoked his Council, and announced The King proposes to establish a Board of Control. The time, in his opinion, had arrived To satisfy the public interest felt In his child's education. “With concern We hear it rumour'd,” said His Majesty, “That there be certain persons who presume To doubt the wisdom of Our Government. 'Tis time to stop this scandal in the State, And, gentlemen, I call for The Control.” As when in some thick-crowded theatre Alarm of his Ministers at this innovation. A sudden voice calls “Fire!” or as a flock Of sparrows startled by the sportsman's gun When they are feeding on a field of wheat, So, at that ominous word (interpreted By each one as a menace to himself) The ministers, upstarting, stared around In all directions. For their only thoughts Not put to flight were thoughts of flight itself. The first one to recall his scatter'd wits Was the Lord Chancellor, whose cleverness Was never long at fault. And he explain'd, “Your Majesty's advisers, to a man, With uncontrollable emotion rise, Responsive to the call for The Control!” The King was toucht. “With pleasure,” he resumed, He explains his principle about the value of principles, “We recognize this unanimity. For principles, when properly laid down, Are like triumphal arches—lofty, large, Solid, and monumental. That's enough. They stand apart, with space to show them off, And, tho' they lead to nothing, they look well. Practical life about its business goes, Passing upon the right side or the left, But always on one side of them, no doubt. Their value is, however, none the less; For in them, as it passes, it admires And his idea about ideas. The symbol of a satisfied idea, Of which idea, if it did not see That satisfying symbol, it would have No satisfactory idea at all. Control, then, is the principle whereon Our educational policy we base, And its best symbol is Publicity. Our dear child's education must henceforth Be publicly conducted.” Reassured About the application and effect Of that uncomfortable word Control, The Ministers breathed freely, and forthwith Drew up the following regulations. “First. Orders in Council. A Board, to be appointed and composed As hereinafter mention'd, will direct The intellectual accomplishments Of the Crown Princess, Diadema. Once Every eight days, a teacher, by the Board Selected for that purpose, will read out In public, and Her Royal Highness write, The weekly lesson previously approved By a Committee of the Board. The date Of every lesson will be notified Beforehand in the Court Gazette, and seats Provided for the Public and the Press. Second. Eight days before the day prescribed, The officiating teacher will transmit A copy of his lecture to the Board. The paper for this purpose must be stamp'd.” [The stamp was a proviso introduced By the Financial Secretary.] “Third. All deviation by the lecturer In his delivery from the written text Is punishable with imprisonment For six months, or a fine proportional.” [That clause was drafted by the Ministers Of Justice and Instruction. But the fine Was due to their Financial Colleague.] “Fourth. The paper by Her Royal Highness penn'd, As soon as finisht, shall be handed round By two Court Pages, for the public eye To examine and admire. And if one fault Can be detected in it, the next day The two Court Pages shall be soundly whipp'd In public. Pereat puer regius, Fiat Justitia!” These rules received Successful inauguration of the new system. The unanimous approval of the Press, And the first trial of them answer'd well. The Court was cramm'd. The public interest Evinced in the new system was immense; Nor is it possible to say how long It might have lasted if it had survived The system's novelty. An accident Unexpected miscarriage of it; Happen'd, however. One unlucky day The manuscript of the Crown Princess proved, When handed round, to be no counterpart Of the Professor's eloquent discourse About the government of that wise Prince, Peter the Great. For what the Princess wrote Was a long treatise upon Alcohol. The two Court Pages were severely whipp'd In public afterwards; and this mistake Was the sole evidence of carelessness Detected in the Royal Pupil's tasks. But then, what clever carelessness it was! What covert irony! The Ambassador Which gives rise to a Russian Question. Of Muscovy immediately applied To have his passports sent him. The Gazette Announced next morning the indefinite Postponement of the customary course Of weekly lectures, and that afternoon 'Twas rumour'd that the Princess was unwell. Three days the Court Physician stay'd at home, Course adopted by the Court Physician, and remarkable cures effected by it. And kept his carriage station'd at his door, Daily expecting orders to attend Her Royal Highness. But they never came. The fourth day, when he ventured out, he found His other patients had meanwhile got well Without his aid, and he at once resolved Not to neglect again their humble claims Upon his valuable care and skill. Days pass'd. The Princess from the Promenade Was miss'd. The King appear'd pre-occupied. Some boors, who at a tavern late one night Strange story set about by some common people. Had been carousing, afterwards declared That, as they pass'd the palace, strolling home, A light from Master Pilgram's casement lured Their curiosity; and one of them, Upon his comrades' shoulders climbing, peep'd In at the casement. There (so ran their tale) He saw, and told his fellows, who in turn Climb'd up, and peep'd, and also saw (Good Heavens!) The Princess sitting—not as it behoves Princesses to sit always, looking straight Before them—but, regardless of all rules Both of decorum and anatomy, As if her neck were broken, with her head Turn'd round, and looking down behind her back. Still stranger! She had taken off one arm, Her right arm, which was screw'd into a vice; And Master Pilgram, with his sleeves tuckt up, Was filing it, and putting a small wheel Into the elbow, just as quietly As you might sew a button on your shirt. Strangest of all! the King was standing by, Yet did not seem to care a button, he That call'd himself the father of his child, While that mysterious Master of Black Arts Was massacring the Royal Innocent. This story was too strange to be believed; And Common Sense, rejecting it, affirm'd Triumph of Common Sense. That, since the Princess had been out of health, Pilgram, perchance, had bled her in the arm; But that to bleed it more conveniently He first took off her arm, was clearly false. A barber might as well take off men's heads To comb and brush them. Clearly, too, the absurd Position, to the Princess by those clowns Attributed, was incompatible With the anatomy of vertebrates, And that respect all royal skeletons Owe more particularly to themselves. Thus, Common Sense prevail'd. And thus may all Things to be thankfully acknowledged. Whose privilege it is to dig the mine Of mortal truths for which posterity Will prize this book, perceive how Providence Hath made it difficult to long mislead Public Opinion. Justice in the end Prevails—when, having placed beyond the reach Of restitution his ill-gotten gains, A rogue is in his hundredth robbery Detected, laid up by the heels at last, And made to mend his manners. In the end Peace triumphs—as it triumph'd in that famed Westphalian Treaty over thirty years Of bloodshed, after every one was kill'd, And every province ravaged. Even so Doth Common Sense prevail (as Peace o'er War, Justice o'er Knavery) when every fop Hath been applauded, every fool believed. And this is a great comfort. But the cause Of that unfortunate mistake which cost The Muscovite Ambassador's recall Was, notwithstanding its simplicity, One of the many things that would have been But for this book for ever unexplain'd. The seat of the intelligence in man Simple solution of a physiological problem. Not even the most intelligent research Can quite intelligibly fix. But, lodged Distributively, the intelligence Of Pilgram's puppet dwelt in polisht groups Of brazen cylinders, the Master changed Daily to suit the subject as required. The King, in Pilgram's absence, had one day With his own hand arranged the Cylinders Of Public Education; and, unused To manage such a delicate machine, Their order inadvertently transposed. The puppet this confusion reproduced With a mechanical fidelity, And hence the Russian Question. But beware, A State Secret. All ye at whose disposal we have placed This confidential statement. Bear in mind That a State secret is a serious thing, And never to be treated as a joke. Altho' indeed, if treated seriously, A joke may sometimes be more dangerous Than all the serious secrets of the State. After the accident recorded here, The Principle is again put into operation. Nothing again occurr'd to interrupt The course of studies publicly resumed By the Crown Princess. Years went by. The time For Court Balls and Court Concerts came at last, And then it was that Pilgram's art achieved The triumph of mechanic etiquette. A telephonic apparatus, placed In contact with the Puppet Princess, ran Below the palace floors to where, unseen, The Master's touch upon the keys controll'd Her conversation. 'Twas consider'd good. “The Princess speaks not much, but she speaks well,” The Court remark'd. “Her Royal Highness seems Subject,” said one, “to absences of mind.” “Ay, but how charming are they! And how well And wittily they prove banalities Repugnant to her nature! ”said the rest. “The other day, when she had deign'd to ask With surprising results. The Foreign Envoy who arrived last week That customary question of the Court, Is it the first time, Sir, that you have been In Diadummiania?—and he Said, Yes, your Royal Highness, the first time, The Princess, with a thoughtful pause, replied, Then you must find things here a good deal changed. But for the tact of the diplomatist Diplomatic tact. To whom this observation was address'd, It might have complicated matters much Between his Court and that of Diadum. But he, in silence, had profoundly bow'd. Profound ability! That bow might mean, If render'd into speech, a thousand things Tremendously significant and yet Conveniently correct: a compromise Between denial and assent, a kind Of courteous reservation of the right Of contradiction at some future time, That cleverly evaded the parade Of an offensive incredulity: Or, construed otherwise, it might imply A stinging epigram, a repartee Unutterably bitter, tho' withal In its expression perfectly polite. The Envoy, for the tact he had display'd On this occasion, by return of post Her speech is nothing, yet the unshaped use of it doth move the hearers to collection.— Horatio. Received the sky-blue ribbon and grand cross Of Knight Commander of the Uncatchable Carp. The blazon of that Order was a fish Between a fish-hook and a frying-pan Passant, the motto of it Point de zèle. VI. THE KING. Tis noon and May. About the happy lawns Diadumntianus, reared in the lap of Dame Rhoda (Tradition) and led by the counsels of Phantasos (Imagination), who, to befriend him, has assumed a form familiar to Tradition (Master Pilgram), passes, under their protecting influence, into the young company of his child. Diadema (Poetry still in its infancy). and is there associated with the sports of her childhood. Sweet airs are breathing. Sunny showers have wash'd The morning white, and deck'd the gleaming buds With drops and sparks. There's gladness in the grass, And a light fluttering music thro' the leaves, Where amorous birds their busy loves begin. The Audience is dismiss'd, the Cabinet Dispersed, the realm for four-and-twenty hours Govern'd till further orders, and the King Into his library retired. This means The Royal Mind, immersed in private depths Of public business, must not be disturb'd. The archives he peruses are inscribed To his equipment for the part played by him in those sports all lands contribute some sweet gift. “Foreign Affairs.” One shelf is labell'd “Spain,” And from the Realms of Ferdinand he fills His pockets with Iberian pastes. The next Is labell'd “France.” The Court of Pharamond Contributes crystal wands of lucid balm, The honey of a hundred barleyfields Congeal'd to amber. Candied fruits from Fez, And rare rose-colour'd sweetmeats from Stamboul, Complete these confidential files. The old man, Like burglar booty-laden, looks around, Listens suspicious, then with trembling hand Touches the panel-portal's secret spring, And down the hollow darkness disappears. Go, triple type of noble weakness! Go In himself he combines the three highest dignities of human life: Royalty, Paternity, and Old Age. There is something paternal in the dignity of a king, something royal in that of a father. Yet in each of these two cases the dignity involves a weakness because it depends upon the recognition of it by its dependents; while in the third case it is so weak that it derives support from the united weaknesses of the other two: the most dignified type of Old Age being both paternal and royal. Thy darkling ways, King, Father, and Old Man! In thee the Kingdoms of the hoary Past And infant Future for awhile unite Their subject sweetnesses and sanctities Beneath a present sovereignty. Death's self But seldom dares the double stroke that smites The twofold childhood of a father's joy. Go! and with thee, shall loveliness be gone From that self-murdering miserable world Whence thou art passing, when it loves no more Its kings and its forefathers. Leave it thou, Unenvied, unimagined, unrebuked, Its poor mechanical contrivances For substituting companies for kings A kingless and godless community, the To Kalon of the newest Solons. And rules for rulers! It will be at best Nothing but a negation of whate'er It is no longer. But to thee, old King, Never shall that unknowing world be known, And Phantasos protects thee from the approach Of its irreverent wretchedness. Go by! The blest asylum of the bygone find, And be forgotten while the world forgets Its own forgetfulness, thou rescued type Of triple weakness, triple dignity, And triple worth, King, Father, and Old Man! Past is the gallery, and the cistern gain'd. Safe in his buoyant bulwark sits the King, And rises slowly. Slowly darkness sinks Beneath him, and above him dawns sweet day. A rosebud falls upon the old man's face, Rose buds and snowdrops Another rosebud, and another still, A pelting rain of roses, and at last A little rosy face thro' rippled curls Peeps laughing down. O happy, happy Sire! Thrice happy King! Where now be all thy plumed And armèd guards? thy long-robed retinue Of solemn councillors? thy stately cares? What smooths the inveterate wrinkle from thy brow, And beckons back thy boyhood from the past? When little arms about thy bended neck United. So rudely yet so tenderly were flung, Instead of stepping down with tread sedate And mien majestic as becomes a king, Didst thou not reel with tottering ecstasy, And roll thee laughing in the glad green grass? And now thy crown upon the apple bough Is hanging, and thy royal robe is doff'd, And thou art running thro' the rosy bowers After a little snowy frock that flits And flutters like a butterfly on before. Here dwelt the child. And round her innocent life Love from the loom of the interfluent years Wove tender veils between her and the world. Day after day the sun out of the sea Rose up to light her, and the good old King Day after day rose up out of the well To love her. Daily light and love return'd, And with them brought her father and the sun. One day the grateful King to Pilgram said, “My life is twofold. On the other side, Out of this happy isle, when I behold That painted puppet, to myself I say, “This puppet is perfection, and 'tis thus My little Diadema might have been.” But, speaking of the puppet, we must oil The King desires to give greater pliancy to the Principle he has adopted. The curtsying contrivances. Last night The springs went stiffly when the Princess danced Her minuet with the Prince of Padua, And it was noticed. The machinery Of the piano-playing still works well. Musical boxes cannot beat it. All In the absence of the Ideal, the highest reality is attributed to the Fictitious, and a Puppet mistaken for a Principle. The scientifically-musical Critics assert such virtuosity Of execution never yet was known Since first princesses on pianos deign'd To play with their own fingers. Some days since, A musical tour de force. An accident, that might have turn'd out ill, Confirm'd this good opinion. When I placed Her Royal Highness on the music-stool, I quite forgot to place the stool itself Where in relation to the instrument I was to place it. And the puppet's hands, Being a little too much to the right, Instead of playing, as they should have play'd, The score thro' in C Major, play'd it all Just one tone higher. As for me myself, I never even noticed it. Next day Method, uninformed by Imagination, attains its highest perfection when it substitutes art for insight, science for art, and terminology for science. I learn'd, however, from an article That nearly fill'd the Musical Gazette, With what consummate science all at once My daughter that concerto had transposed From the Ionic (without one mistake) Into the Hypomyxolydian Tone, By substituting for the Major Seventh And Third, the Minor Third and Seventh. Forthwith, One of the critics having tried to prove That 'twas in fact the Hypodoric Tone, And not the Hypomyxolydian one, The Princess had employ'd, between them all Broke out a fiercely vehement dispute, As full of unpronounceable Greek words As of invectives—nete, and paranete, And lichanos, and hypatè, and the names Of only those musicians who are dead, Or would be dead if they had lived at all, Terpander, Guido of Arezzo, even Pythagoras, whom no one ever knew. What a bewildering machinery In this process Criticism has the last word. These critics have devised for grinding out The grist of things with such a clatter and whirl Of terrifying terms, that only they Can tell the meaning of the din they make! Some men there be who do not fear a wolf, But take him soon as ‘Look you’ by the throat If they should meet one in a mountain pass, Yet are they disconcerted by the sound Inside a windmill, while the miller moves Undaunted, tho' a coward he may be, Thro' all the hubbub of its cogs and bolts As quietly as an official clerk Would docket a death warrant, or endorse A declaration of immediate war. Just so the critics in their mill.” “Just so!” The Master echo'd, and the King went on, “Two selves within me for dominion strive, Dualism Making me theirs by turns. And one of them Is not the King, nor like him. Nay, the King He from the King's own breast, if that could be, Would banish. In this island of delights] The King is both his subject and his slave; For, with the cares, the compensating charms That dwell in kingly circumstance are dead, And Diadum in Diadema dies At his unkingly bidding. Back once more Across yon narrow straits in mine own hall, The King resumes his sway. But there at times So perfect seems that puppet, I myself Am half persuaded to believe all true Its mimic graces, and proclaim a doll The heiress of my kingdom and my crown. Here, all is changed within me. Here, I dread My distant self that ominously frowns On these enjoyments, beckoning from mine arms The treasured life made mine by their embrace. O Pilgram, can she ever face that Court? I tremble but to think of it, and feel A thousand nameless fears, tho' well I know The child hath gifts no teaching gives. Her gift Of song, for instance, above all her song! How sweet to hear her singing! Seems it not Inspiration without art. A language of her own that must be sung, Else it would have no meaning, tho' it means Everything when she sings it? She herself, What is she, when she sings? My child, or born Among the light-springs of some throbbing star, And wafted hither only for awhile On wings whose flight anon may bear her hence? Where is it, what she sings of? Hard to guess! But when she sings, athwart my spirit comes A something felt like nothing felt before, A something found like all things miss'd till then, A memory of what hath never been, A hope of what I know can never be!” Scarce had the King this strange avowal made, Before he felt ashamed of it, and sigh'd, “See what such fancies come to! Follow them, And farewell common sense! I'll not deny, Good Master Pilgram, that I sometimes doubt If it be proper for a Princess, born Sole heiress of a reputable throne, To sing as naturally as a bird That never has been taught to sing at all, But grows up wild among the leaves. At least, Art without inspiration. I wish that she would sometimes sing real airs That every one knows when and where to praise; Airs that, when sung, make every listener fear And tremble for the voice, as for a bold And rash rope-dancer who might break his neck, And whom you naturally must applaud With infinite relief when, at the last, He by three pirouettes his perch regains. Ay, those are real emotions, every one Is capable of feeling! But alas, When Diadema sings you feel them not. You listen without fear, you even forget All, as you listen, but to listen still To her wild music. And full sure am I, Could we discover whence such music comes, 'Twould be forbidden by mine own police. How, after listening to it, can one sign, Practical politics. With due consideration of details, Decrees forbidding citizens to place Unfasten'd flower-pots upon window-sills? How can one ponder with impartial mind The question whether Whigs will do more harm Than Tories? Tories revolutionize The Monarchy more rapidly than Whigs? The other day, when at the Council Board My Minister of Justice read me out A long report of his on Law Reform, Mysteriously within myself I heard A mocking echo of those melodies The child sings to the sea-wind and the sea. And suddenly I cried, ‘O sing once more An awkward mistake. The ninety-seventh paragraph sublime Of that seraphic and enchanting Code Of Criminal Procedure!’ By good luck, Looking at my Lord Chancellor's state wig, I saw its curls were standing stiff on end With horror, and the sight of them recall'd My wits to the realities of life. But such distractions must not be again: For I detected, as the Board dispersed In some confusion, an exchange of looks And whisperings between my Ministers, That augur'd mischief—‘Circumstance foreseen, And by the nineteenth clause provided for’— ‘Family Statute’—‘Salique law’—‘clear case’— ‘The Younger Branch’—‘Mentalderangement’—‘State In danger’—‘Regency!’ Ha, ‘Regency’? I'll regency the rascals! ‘Case foreseen’? ‘Mental derangement’? I'll derange their plots Foreseen, or unforeseen! I'll . . . . . .” Piercing sweet Diadema's Song. Above the angry old King's hoary head, Soar'd, bird-like, from the sea-girt balcony A voice that waked the sleeping isle with song Seductive as Calypso's. And therewith, To which the universe responds. Woo'd by its witchcraft, out of glens remote And neighbouring bowers, from the ethereal hills And headlong streams, responsive strains arose; Innumerable melodies, that turn'd All secret throbbings of the palpitant heart Of Silence into raptures audible, As thoughts to sounds are turn'd along the strings Of a thrill'd harp. It was the manifold cry Of Being, yet unbodied, claiming birth, And challenging quick response, ay or nay, From all things in the universe. Appeals, Blithe and imperious, answer'd from afar By fluttering notes of welcome faint with fear, The music of it is to the soul what movement is to the sea: A happy fear, and full of timorous joy! Lost in such music's tempest of delight, Sea-like the soul flows ignorantly forth With all her forces, and from all her deeps, Not knowing whither. Wave on wave, and thought A liberation of forces. On thought, arise and mingle and roll on In ever vaster, more voluminous throngs. They question one another whence they come, And what they be. “Art thou Eternity? I am Desire.” “I Beauty.” “I am Love.” “Let us be one!” Embracing, they unite: And then, surcharged, the sobbing billow bursts, Rebuilds itself, and is again dissolved, And again built and broken. “Whence art thou? “From the far depths. And thou?” “From the far heights.” “Thy name?” “I am Sublimity. And thine?” “Poësy. To the heavens and their high stars Uplift me, brother, on thy breast aloft!” Still'd to a sigh is that melodious storm. Soft calm succeeds. A silent transport thrills The birth of Genius. The sea of thoughts. Sublimity and Depth Have been united, and from their embrace A god is being born. The lyric winds Breathe low, the halcyon broods upon the wave, And o'er the slow-subsiding tumult flits A tremulous aw'd gladness, whispering “Hush!” All this, but in a language of its own That into ours is untranslatable, The sorceries of that wild song reveal'd To those who heard it. Pilgram, arms outstretch'd, Eyes that kindle. Eyes flashing, feet scarce touching earth, and all His godhood quivering in him, recognized And hail'd the accents of his native heaven: But the old King, his elbows on his knees Eyes that weep Based, and his stooping head between his hands, Sat huddled upon the low wall of the well That separated and yet form'd the link Between those lives so closely each to each By love united, tho' so all unlike, So different yet so indivisible, His own and Diadema's. In himself He knew not what was passing. But his heart Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?— Horatio. Answer'd the child's bewildering melodies In the mute language it best understood, A language whose soft syllables are tears. VII. THE PRINCESS. The new-born babe upon its mother's breast An Idyll. Lacks nothing. But the loss of life begins At life's beginning, in the guise of growth; And every gain, the tributary years Bring with them to enrich it, fills the room Of something lost. The blossom wants a grace That vanish'd with the bud; when comes the fruit The flower is gone; and ah, which most prevail, The gains or losses of the neutral time 'Twixt bud and blossom, when nor boy nor girl Are either man or woman, or any more That perfect sexless creature so complete In its own perishable charm, a child? The lingering gentleness of childhood hides The departure of Childhood Its soon-dishonour'd presence in the heart Of boisterous boyhood, when the little hand, Within whose clasping fingers it was fain To insinuate a perpetual caress, Turns to a fist that combatively grasps Leaves a difference between boyhood A flower-stem like the pommel of a sword: And, while the force of a disfiguring growth Converts what was erewhile a butterfly Into a chrysalis that disavows The ashamed remembrance of its own lost wings, The growing boy's embarrass'd consciousness Of those propensities that are the cause Why every garden hath a garden wall Creates within his predatory breast A stealthy greed of the forbidden fruit, Ere yet the fruit itself hath power to tempt. And girlhood. Not so the crescent maiden. Husht she moves About a world where all familiar things, As in a dream, have furtively assumed A strange and undivined significance, Half wooing and half warning her. She feels Her hesitating steps held back from harm, Haunted, and over-hover'd, and pursued By a protecting phantom. But to feel Protected is, perchance, to be aware That there is peril somewhere. With shy guess That shuns the revelation it invokes, To Modesty, her mystic guardian new, Et præsidium et dulce decus. The woman-instinct in the maiden-child Confidingly for secret guidance turns. She knows not why the watch is set, nor whence The danger it mysteriously denotes: But what she carelessly enjoy'd before As common treasures, coveted by none Since shared with all, must needs, if menaced, be More precious to her; and, if watch'd, less safe. The Eden of her Infancy remains On all sides round her, innocent and fair: But thro' its roses, and its revelling leaves, She sees at intervals the boundary walls, Suspects the existence of a world beyond, And feels the limits of security. What startles her What brings the sudden blush, Æstuat in corde pudor. The sudden sigh? Hath some wild bird, that bears In his blown plumage the bewildering breath Of freedom, or the blush of feathers stain'd Red by strange fruits, alighted for awhile Upon the battlements of Paradise? Or where unlifted branches hide the dim Husht gateway, hath she heard some venturous key Trying its never-yet-attempted locks? No! 'Twas the nightingale's first evening note That trembled from the uninvaded bowers. And yet what wonder that the maiden starts? The moonborn music of the nightingale Hath in it ever something from afar. But Diadema with the growing years The Childhood of Poësy, Outgrew not infancy. It grew with her, And, mingling with her maiden beauty, clung As clings the calyx where the flower unfolds. Nothing had changed around her. In herself Nothing, begun and ended, mark'd the bound Of that blest kingdom we, who measure it By our remembrance only, left too soon To learn its limits. Thither we return Long afterward, full weary of the world Since traversed, and yet know it not again. Like those Phœnician voyagers we are, Who, voyaging in search of lands unknown, Sail'd round the globe, and reach'd at last a land They knew not. 'Twas the land they first had left, And the poësy of Childhood, Sailing in search of other lands beyond. So we, who call that fair land Poësy, Which is forgotten Childhood reattain'd. But slowly, softly, imperceptibly, Into pure poësy pure childhood pass'd From hour to hour thro' Diadema's days; United in Diadema. As round the southward traveller melts unmark'd The Italian into the Sicilian sky, Or as the Ganges on its bosom bears The Brahmin floating to his sacred goal, Seaward and heavenward on the selfsame wave. “She changes not,” said Rhoda to the King, “But with an annually differing charm Remains herself. I understand at last The meaning of the dragon in my dream. Sleeping, from grace to grace her childhood grows, Without an effort. The bright years of it Are gems from earth, and sea, and sky distill'd, Each in its turn more lovely than the last, And she, the crescent diadem that links With golden interfusion gem to gem.” Not lonesome in her solitary isle, The childs world, Albeit alone, did Diadema dwell. Pilgram, her father, and Dame Rhoda came And went miraculously. 'Twas not strange. Wherein miracles are matters of course. So did the blossoms. So did everything. What had been always, always still would be, For why should it be otherwise? The sun Into the sea went naturally down, But not more naturally than the King Went down into the well. They both came back, And that was all she knew, or cared to know. She never would have thought of digging holes Into the earth, and searching them to find What happen'd to the flowerets underground; Nor thought of plunging in the sea to seek The sun beneath it. Why, then, should she think Of asking explanations from the well? It was her father's way of going down At nightfall, as the sun's way was the sea. And morning after morning, when the sun Had high enough in heaven at noontide climb'd To peep into the well, the old King rose. The sun rose first, the King rose afterwards: He rested with her all the glad day long: At night she fell asleep, and he was gone: So was the sun. The sun was first to go, Since first to come. The sun would come again To-morrow, as the sun came yesterday, Bringing the old King back. Who doubts the sun? Her father and the sun had never fail'd. What joy it was to welcome his return! He look'd so comely, rising up his well Out of his dusky dwelling underneath, His golden crown upon his silver locks, His sceptre in his hand, his royal robe Upon his shoulders! With maternal care, And infinite precaution and advice, The little maiden help'd him to descend Out of his oaken bucket. Half his life Pass'd in the bottom of a well, explain'd His ignorance about all sorts of things It was her pride to teach him. How, indeed, Would fathers ever know, or ever see, The things that are important to be known And noticed in this wondrous world, if left Uneducated by their children? “Come! Diadema imparts to her father Here is a bird's nest, with four tiny birds, And each of them was only yesterday A smooth round speckled pebble. Upon the shore News of great importance; Are little pebbles too, that birds would be Had they the chance; but these the sea scrapes back, And turns them into fishes. Hast thou heard The story of the Butterflies? Not yet? Then listen, Father! Yesterday, there hung On yonder branch a cluster of green nuts. Green nuts they look'd, but nuts they were not. Each She being in possession of private information about passing events, A case was, full of woven fineries, Rare tissues by the cunning Spider spun As only she knows how. The Butterflies Had found this out. And so by night they came, And, while the Spider slept, they oped and search'd Her treasure-cases. There were robes of rose, And robes of blue, and there were yellow robes, Broider'd and beautiful with sparks and spots. These to the Butterflies the Spider gave, But only on condition that they go And fetch her all the colours she requires For her fine spinning. For those colours come From far away. The blue is from the sky, he yellow from the sun, the purple tints Are from the sea and mountains, and the red From evening's crimson clouds. The Butterflies Go flying all about the flowers, for there They often find the colours that she wants, And then they go no further. When the robes That all the Summer they have worn are soil'd, Ashamed to wear them, to the moon they go, And there they get their wing-robes washt pure white Before the Springtime. Then the Spider weaves Fresh colours in. But in the Winter-tide, When their moon-whiten'd wings they have put by For Spring's return, a cold wind often blows, So sharp that down it shakes and scatters them Thick on the ground. That grieves the Butterflies: And, if you touch or take them in your hand, The white wings, disappearing, leave behind Only warm tears the Butterflies have wept Because they cannot wear their wings again.” “Whence dost thou know all this?” the old King sigh'd. In which the King is deeply interested; but which, having escaped the vigilant notice of his Lord Chancellor, would otherwise have remained unknown to His Majesty. “'Tis Pilgram that hath told me,” said the child, “And he knows everything. Dame Rhoda, too! 'Twas she that tole me all about the girl Who wept because she was to wed a Frog, And yet the Frog was all the while a Prince. I would not mind so much had I to wed A little bright-eyed big-mouth'd Frog. We three In Frogland, at the bottom of a well, Would live together, thou, and he, and I. The Rain-drops tell the Frogs so many things, When they, to see their cousins, have come down! Their cousins are the common Water-drops That here together dwell in pools and ponds. They say it is Earth's fault, and punishment, That Heaven is still so far away from Earth. I know not what the fault was; but I know Heaven, for Earth's sake, hath wept so many tears That all the ponds, and even all the sea, Are fill'd quite full. But this could not be help'd, For tears must still fall somewhere. The kind Heaven Thinks, ‘Since the Water is not as the Earth, But almost, as it were, a child of mine, It cannot be forbid to go and see The Water sometimes.’ So when Heaven comes down To see the Water, if the day be fine, The Water, for Heaven's welcoming, invites Earth's woods and mountains. There, they all have leave To stand head-downwards, and to dance about Blithe with the little ripples, if a breeze Sets the dance going. That reposes them. Out of the water, they must always stand Head-upwards, and stay always in one place. Thou good old Father, I could talk with thee For ever about all things! For, indeed, No one knows how to listen half so well As thou dost.” That was true. The glad old King Knew how to listen. And in every tale He is strongly affected by this intelligence. His little teacher told him he believed. Nothing had ever seem'd to him so wise, So fascinating, or so full of truth, As Diadema's stories. Years, that left Less infantine his fair instructress, found His faith in her more childlike. Blossom-girt, The departure of the swadlows. About the casement of the craggy tower Wherein she dwelt, a marble balcony Had Pilgram built, with golden balustrade. Here every morning old Dame Rhoda brought Her spinning-wheel, and many a ballad sung Or story told, while Diadema watch'd The wide sea, listening dreamily. One day, “The swallows are departing!” said the child. “And thou, too, wilt be going hence ere long,” The Dame replied. “Go hence?” the child ask'd. “Where?” “To thine own Kingdom.” “Is not this mine own? What is that other Kingdom?” And the Dame Answer'd, “It is a land thou wilt be call'd To govern in thy father's stead, for he Is growing old and tired.” The child looked sad. “My father tired?” she said. “I saw not that. What is he tired of? Here shall he remain When next he comes, and I will sing him songs The honey-bees have taught me; songs that bring Sleep from the sighing hearts of Summer woods, Like a tame bird.” The old Dame shook her head. “The crown,” she said, “makes this impossible.” Gaily the child replied, “That cannot be, For is it not his own crown, all his own, To do with as he pleases?” “Nay, not so,” Dame Rhoda sigh'd. “The crown, child, is not his. He is the crown's. For to his crown a king Belongs, as doth a father to his child. Children and crowns are the great gifts of God, And cannot be got rid of. King and Sire, To thee, his child, one half thy father's heart Belongs, and to his kingly crown the rest.” The Princess mused; then said, with moisten'd eyes, “Only one half? And I must share him, then, With others? He whom others call their king, And I my father! Can a heart's two halves Make up one whole if each loves something else? Nay, were it mine, I would not wear that crown!” “Yet must thou wear it,” said the Dame, “ere long. And thou, I trust, wilt wear it many a year, And suffer it with queenly patientness.” But Diadema suddenly exclaim'd, Dame Rhoda instructs Diadema in the duties of the crown. “What, if I gave my crown away?” “Thy crown Thou canst not give away,” the Dame replied, “For there is none to give it to; and they That were not born to wear it, know not how.” The little Princess hung her head. The thought Premonitions Of that inevitable crown return'd Continually afterwards to vex Her joy in all the present with the fear Of an unwelcome future: and full oft “Oh, is there no one that will rescue me And all I love from it?” she sigh'd unheard. And still the Summers came and went, and still Of the departure of childhood, The Winters: and the flowers fell, and the frosts: But flower and frost, Summer and Winter-tide, Came not and went not as of old, like friends Who, going, know that when they come again They shall find nothing alter'd. In the child Chaste mysteries were passing. Day by day The sunward season of the virgin year Transforms itself, and wonders at the change: Each morrow some surprising charm reveals And the coming of womanhood. In secret places, by the timid time Demurely welcomed with suggestive sighs: At dawn, from dells and hollows, bare before, New buds are peeping: and along the husht Rich heavens, at eve, a rosy softness falls, Preluding the approach of mellower hours. So, daily, as her deepening maidenhood Her little body with new beauties deck'd, Did Diadema, flower-like, turn them all Into new blushes that were prophecies. And fifteen times, since first her bowery realms Their maiden monarch ruled, the fourfold year Had turn'd the green leaf golden. Fifteen times The moonborn months had brought the snows, and brought The snowdrops, and those flowers of frailer bud That blossom in the front of May, and fall Ere June is over. Fifteen jewels fair Dame Rhoda counted in the crown of gems Wrought by the unsleeping dragon of her dream: And now no more thro' Diadema's isle It draws near the season.— Horatio. The primrose lit the pathways of the Spring, But Summer and the rose were everywhere. VIII THE SHEPHERD. The late moon, captured by the coming dawn, Yearning. Below the sea's edge linger'd. 'Twas a night Of Summer in mid-solstice, when the dark Is starriest, and soon dies. Dame Rhoda slept. But Diadema, risen from restless dreams, Was leaning o'er her golden balcony, And listening to the solitary sound Of waves that, hid in whisperous shadows, heaved With a soft yearning murmur. Not for joy, As heretofore her happy wont had been, But for the solace of a new-born sense Of nameless sadness, she began to sing. And all along the lone night wandering went The wistful music of the song she sang, Where there was none to hear it. None to hear? What genuine song was ever sung unheard, Tho' sung not in the hearing of the world? Athwart night's trembling silence, clear and sweet, Song answers song: which echo can only mimic. Another voice, responsive to her own, In song came floating, as athwart dark meers The swimming stag at midnight seeks his mate. At first she doubted if a voice it were, Or but of hers a mocking echo borne Upon the light wind from the lifted shell Of some wild sea-sprite. Wonderingly, she stopp'd Her singing, listen'd, and then sang again, And again stopp'd, and listen'd. But the voice Still, from the distance, thro' the silence sang. Maiden, it sang, a boy's heart sent me hither To answer thine, whose voice hath spoken to it. Come! Let us wander, he, thou, I, together The wide world thro'! For short is Song's way thro' it From heart to heart: and, that way, soul meets soul, Safe tho' between them all the wide world roll! Thus, deep in darkness and in distance hid, A spirit sang responsive to the song Of her own spirit, and her soul had found A soul whose language was the same as hers. She was a king's child, in a palace born, The Shepherd, By a god guarded. But beyond the crags Her steps had never climb'd, and narrow sea, Another child, whose heart to hers attain'd Its destin'd way, among the mountains dwelt. A shepherd boy, he roam'd his native hills, The unguarded guardian of their wandering tribes Of hardy goats: not kingborn, nor himself Of kinglier circumstance, or higher state, Than Hebron's Harper when he shepherded His father's flocks, beyond the camps of Saul. Born of the People and the Mountains: born Where strength is strongest, patience patientest, (Far from the sordid cities that entomb That turbulent and miserable crowd Whose meanness mocks the honest name it takes, And, being but the Populace, presumes To call itself the People) lofty life He lack'd not, tho' of lowly birth. But ah! This lord of the lone eagle-haunted heights Was Diadummiania's peasant, she And the Princess. Its princess; and the inexorable code Of Diadummianian law forbade A shepherd's son, of peasant birth, to love The daughter of a king, or a king's daughter And princess born, to give her princely heart To a born peasant. Love and Circumstance Were rivals ever since the world began: And, neither to the other yielding, each Scourges and racks the wretch who disobeys Its despot rule. But Song hath softer laws, And Dream a larger freedom. Dream, then, still A Pastoral. Of love, young Shepherd, and of love sing on, Till, singing, dreaming ever, thou thyself, And she, thy sung-and-dream'd-of love, released From perishable circumstance, become An everlasting dream, a deathless song! The Mountains have their dreams, the People theirs And both are patient dreamers. Songs have they, Moreover, immemorial as themselves, Taught by the mountains to the mountaineer: Lays, never lost, whose legendary strains Are gifts the People from its fathers got, And, unforgetting, to its children gives: Remember'd records of a lyric race, In whose remote descent the People's sons As lofty and as old a lineage claim As those fair kings the People's childlike faith Confirms for ever upon thrones renown'd; For, prince and peasant, each is Song's own child, And equal-born all Song's own children be. What was it that, in song, drew forth the heart Of the young Shepherd, filling the warm spheres Of starry darkness with its wild appeals And passionate welcomes? 'Twas a promise hail'd The Star of Promise. With doubtful wonder, but undoubting faith, In the bright upspring of a prophet star To Kepler, to Copernicus, unknown, Unguess'd by Galileo, unreveal'd To wondering Tycho when he saw the light In Cassiopeia that is seen no more: But hail'd by Gaspar, Melchior, Balthazar, The Star of Promise: star whose lustre led The prescient footsteps of the Shepherd Kings To Bethlem, bearing for a babe divine The mystic tribute of the Morning Land. A star, and not a star: a light from heaven Hail'd by the heart alone; and by the heart That hails it haply half misunderstood, Yet not in vain all trusted. Mary's Babe The adoring Magians deem'd of royal birth, Mistaking His true kingdom. But in Him The promise of a blessing long invoked They trusted, and in trusting it were blest. So sang the Shepherd to the nameless star That on his soul was rising: so his heart Follow'd its gracious guidance, bearing gifts From boyhood's golden orient. And a voice Symphony. That shed forth music as a star sheds light Answer'd the singing of his heart with song. A maiden's soul, it sang, hath sent me hither, Shepherd, to find in thine the mate 'twas needing. Come! Let us wander, she, thou, I, together The wide world thro'. For safe where Song is leading, Wide tho' the world that holds them far apart, Soul beckons soul, and heart goes forth to heart. Night after night the same appeal, the same Adagio. Unfailing response! Night by night in song They communed with each other from afar, The Shepherd and the Princess. Night by night Their songs consorted, and their spirits touch'd. And, daily, all day long the mingled hope And memory of the last time, and the next, Of those melodious midnight communings Linger'd within them like an elfin light, And hover'd round them like an elfin call, And put a charm about them, circling them With close enchantment, like the fluttering sphere Of fire around some wizard altar traced. And he became as those on whose changed life A fairy's choice hath thrown its spell: to whom Their home and kindred, their diurnal ways, And all familiar things thenceforth appear Distant, and strange, and foreign to the sense Of their own nearness to an unseen power That speaks in silence, glows in darkness, breathes On sleeping lids, and burns upon shut lips. For wheresoe'er they gaze, there shines a star; Allegro. And wheresoe'er they move, there sounds a song: A star unseen, a song unheard, by all But they, in whose thrill'd ear for ever rings The fairy music, and in whose wild eyes Reflected gleam the lights of fairyland. So strong the charm is on the life it lures, And, luring, loosens from all else on earth, That with its spell, if broken, breaks the heart Of him whose being it hath once possess'd. For never can the disenchanted wretch Resume his former life's forsaken aims, And, aimless left, he pines away, and dies. Nor less, the lonely maiden of the isle Andante. That night's enrapturing revelation fill'd With incommunicable consciousness Of a new sense, for ever set apart. Secluded, consecrated, and reserved For service to a strange felicity. And she became as some young priestess, vow'd From childhood to cold Vesta's fane, whose deep And dreaming eyes have drawn from heaven a god To kiss them, when by night ambrosial arms Have clasp'd her sleeping, and she wakes aware Of a divine inexplicable bliss, That came i' the dark, and went, to morn bequeathing Mysterious promise of its blest return: For all around her, from that moment, wears A meaning aspect, mindful of the joy Her seal'd lips whisper not to her husht heart: Within the shrine a warmer glory broods, Fine transports tremble thro' the sacred grove, The lustral water flames like fire, the air Heaves with intenser breathings. Day by day, And night by night, since that first night's surprise Dissolved the distance fate between them set, So fared it with these two, whose days were dreams, As all their nights were songs. And more than this, No knowledge of love's need in others taught Their innocence to crave. What fate denied They miss'd not. Song and dream to them were all. Two souls in song, two songs in one song blent, Rhapsodists. Far from each other, far from all the haunts Of human intercourse, the Herdsman's Son And the King's Daughter dwelt. On either side A kingdom, Boyhood's here, there Maidenhood's: And on each kingdom's solitary throne A child: and all between them the deep sea, And the strong hills: and yet those kingdoms touch'd. Themselves they knew not, and they knew still less Each other, save in song: nor ever met, Save in the mystic world song made for them. But Pastoral Innocence, a shepherd boy, And Maiden Majesty, a monarch's child, Born of an age no chronicle records, Across a land no traveller hath mapp'd, Met in a song undated and unnamed: And there, its bridal melodies begot Birth of Ballad Poetry. Songs upon songs that live from land to land, From age to age, retaining in their tone, Tho' far away from their forgotten source, The sweetness, the simplicity, the strength Of the True People's love for its True Kings, And theirs for their True People. For of old True Kings there were, and a True People too, Ere twixt the People and its Kings arose A Third Authority, displacing both By forces stolen from the strength of each. Those songs belong to all men, and to none. They are the wanderers of the air we breathe; Whose birdlike notes, untaught, unteachable, Woo us, we know not whither; come to us, We know not whence; move us, we know not why. In vain we wonder who the singers were That sung them first. The world's first singers found Such songs already hovering here and there Above them. Long before old Homer's birth, And older far than he, the Iliad lived. For ever, when the hoary-headed King Song bears to after ages Heard his child singing her wild song, to him That song was like an epicedion Pour'd from the burst heart of a dying swan, That down the interminable stream of time, Buried in its melodious bosom, bore Him dead, and all the days he loved, to days He knew not. Like a dream his life appear'd. And as men, dreaming, sometimes know they dream, And fear to wake because their dream is fair, So he. His thoughts, his feelings, his beliefs, All the conditions that to consciousness Give character, seem'd creatures of that song, Which, floating, bore them with it far away To other ages and a world not his. A barren world! bitterly destitute Of those delights that o'er the happy isle Where he, Dame Rhoda, Pilgram, and the child Together dwelt, spontaneously diffused An effortless felicity creating What after ages call the Age of Gold. A dream of the Golden Age. O Age of Gold! Age that hath never been, Nor ever shall be, yet for ever art! O Golden age to every age once given, For all the ages have their Golden Age, Dear age of lost delights, sad memory seeks Vainly in ages past, thou smilest still, Safe in the happy heart that seeks thee not, Because it knows not yet that thou art gone. Stay, illusion!— Horatio. There, and there only, is the Age of Gold! IX. THE POPPY. And wilt thou leave us? Leave thine island home, What the Poppy said to the Princess. Thy happy bowers, ere from their boughs be fled The green leaf and the bird? These come and go, But thou, once gone, wilt never come again. The springtide of the world is once a year, But once a life the springtide of the heart; And when it goes 'tis gone for evermore. Strangers will greet thee in the guise of friends. But trust them not! The blossoms of thy life, When they have pluck'd them from thee, they will place All faded twixt the leaves of bitter books, To mark some haply-else-forgotten page In the hard chronicle of lives not thine. And thou wilt mourn, “I gave myself away To many. One had this, another that. Nothing, for all I gave them, gave they me!” King's Daughter, thou art still thine own. Still thine Is all thou art. It will be thine no more, When thou art theirs. For thou canst separate A drop of dew into a hundred drops, Each subsequent droplet perfect as the first: But not so canst thou subdivide thyself. Amongst them, soon as thou art theirs, will they Thy perfect self distribute. And for this, Fain would they buy thee with a golden crown, But keep thyself, and give that crown to me! Give it to me, and I will hide it deep Where few shall find it, and those few be souls Worthy to wear its guarded glory! Night, Deep night at noonday, will I round it weave, So that to see it men must shut their eyes. Give me thy crown, King's Daughter! Nightly thus, What Dame Rhoda saw in her vision. Wan in the moonlight, like a wistful ghost, With gestures passionately suppliant, The pleading Poppy to the Princess spake. 'Twas Phantasos that to this lonesome isle Had lured Favonius, from Typhoon's red lash Its rescued victim bearing: here he rear'd The regal pile whose rocky courts conceal'd A kingdom's maiden heiress: here for those Who, coming when the time appointed came, For his pale votary's investiture, Should bring the crown, and weave the robe, he wrought Predestined ways: and here the heedful god High pageant had for this event prepared, Whereto his prescience shaped the unconscious course Of antecedent circumstance. These things The Poppy knew not. But, of things unknown Still dreaming ever, in prophetic dreams The approaching influence of his promised hour That prophet dreamer felt. The desert crag, His hard and solitary home, was turn'd Into a palace: in its barren breast Now beat a living heart, a child's, a queen's: The rocky ledge, so long his lonesome lair, Was now a gold-girt balcony, embower'd In blossoms of all hues: and over these, When she among them in the moonlight sat, He, stooping, touch'd the maiden's pensive cheek With his pale lips, and whisper'd in her ear, And breathed thro' all her thoughts. To vex the hope Within him hidden, unvictorious Eternal desire, the condition of eternal life. Had striven the innumerable years. For every Spring that hail'd a promise born, A promise perisht every Winter mourn'd. Yet year by year unbaffled, year by year Still faithful to the secret of his strength, He gazed around him, and around him saw Nothing but solitude: the sun and moon, The steadfast stars, the everlasting hills, The everchanging clouds, and wandering waves. When o'er the sea, with frolic footstep light, The sweet Spring Wind, returning, sang, “Behold, Back am I come with far-off-gather'd gifts, New hopes I bring thee, and another year, Believe, endeavour, and begin once more!” May after May, he shudderingly oped Aspiration. The downy casket in whose depths lay hid A year's desire, and brought his treasure forth, And spread it in the sun, and braved the chance Of blighting chills and scorching heats, and fought And wrestled for the rapture of success. And January after January Found the frail athlete stricken, overthrown, And prostrate, but with an unvanquisht will Waiting the moment to begin again. His crag was a king's castle: and he, too, Transformation. Dreaming of kingliness, had dream'd himself Into a king; tenacious of his rights, Resolute, royal-hearted, lofty, strong, Far-seeing, patient, vigilant, tho' still Nor gold nor purple his, nor robe nor crown. As ductile as the bee-made yellow wax Induration. The yellow gold is, by the craftsman curved Into that glittering circlet: and more soft In substance than the flesh of new-born babes The little Tyrian fish, whose lustrous blood Brightens the wool that leaves Tarentum's looms Or Sidon's vats to deck the pomp of kings: But hard they make, and all inflexible, The soul that claims the purple and the gold. The Poppy had his dream. To him that dream Was Space, that dream was Time. He reckon'd not Concentration. The ages. He beheld the sea immense, And knew it bounded. In himself he felt The immensity of unfulfill'd desire, And knew it boundless. Neither small nor great The world to him, nor long nor short the time. A dream hath no beginning and no end. One day, a sound of voices, and a noise Pilgram, while building the Island Palace, discovers the Poppy clinging to the rock; and is recognised by the Dreamflower as Phantasos. Of hammers. The bare rock's bruised granite shriek'd Beneath the grinding crowbar: and a shade, Cast from the sudden image of a man, Fell o'er the dreaming flower. Above it stood The form of one who, meditating, lean'd Upon his staff, that was a measuring rod. The Poppy trembled, for he recognized The presence of a god. Within him woke Memories that long had slumber'd, and he call'd, “Phantasos! Phantasos!” In feign'd surprise, Dissembling his design, the god replied, “Ha, dost thou know me, Mekon? Prithee say, Pale keeper of the secret of the past, What dost thou here, where never man hath been? I am the Herald of Humanity. 'Twill follow me anon: and then begins The good old comedy my touching up Makes always new, with transformation-scenes Fantastical, and fooleries perform'd By Youth and Age, with Common Sense for clown. Long while it is since I myself have heard The name whereby my fellow-gods once hail'd, And thou again dost hail me. To this crag What god hath chain'd thee? No Prometheus thou, Poor little nursling of Persephonè!” “Persephonè!” the startled Poppy sigh'd, To whom the Dreamer appeals for restoration to the lost happiness of his former state: wherein the contemplation of his own conceptions was a delight unimpaired by any desire to release those conceptions in the effect produced by them on others. But this prayer is rejected by the god, who repudiates the authorship of the change attributed to his influence. The Poppy then invokes the aid of Phantasos towards the attainment of his desires. “Persephonè! Ah, tell me, Phantasos, May I no more behold her? Bear me back To that lost kingdom whence, I know not how, Nor why, nor when, I wander'd up to earth! Was it thy whisper, or some other voice, Beguil'd to its betrayal my desire?” But the god answer'd, “Dreamer, ne'er have I Beguiled thee, or betray'd. Within thyself Deep sunken lies the kingdom thou hast lost, And in thyself the kingdom thou would'st gain. Thee from the world around thee I released. The world thou seekest is within thee. Fool, Seek it no more where thou shalt find it not!” “Mock me not!” sigh'd the Poppy. “What I want I have not. All that in myself I find Is but the promise of it. Give me thou, What thou alone of all the gods canst give, Promise fulfill'd! Give me my robe and crown!” “Who promised thee,” said Phantasos, “the robe And crownthou cravest?” And the Dream-flower sigh'd, “Favonius.” “Fool, to trust him!” said the god. The god, after deriding the inordinate ambition of this frail creature “A promise is a word, a word a breath, And a breath nothing!” “Nay,” the Poppy laugh'd, “I trust Necessity. For crown and robe I need not more than robe and crown need me. Who else can wear them as their worth deseryes?” “O strength in weakness!” Phantasos exclaim'd. “Thine is life's secret. Ever as thou art Stay, little one! Dream on for evermore, And be thyself a sempiternal joy Dream'd by the sleeping earth! But crave not thou Gifts that are curses. What are robe and crown To thee, King Lackland?” “Listen!” said the Flower, “Nor in thy thoughts degrade me, King of Thought! (an ambition which the Poppy defends and justifies). For him that feels and knows himself a king There is a kingdom, wheresoe'er it be. And were his kingdom in the deep sea sunk, It would arise, its monarch to receive, Or were his kingdom hung between the horns Of the high moon, and frozen fast to them, It would descend, his summons to obey, Soon as to rule it, crown'd and robed, he came. I know not where for me my kingdom waits, But that for me 'tis waiting well I know.” Silent above the Poppy Pilgram bent. Is constrained toadmire a 'faith so strong, in a frame so slight. There was a glory on his gracious brows, A fire in his unfathomable eyes. At last he lifted up his face, and raised Enraptured hands to heaven, and laugh'd, “Dull lords Of my renounced Olympus! you that rest In unsurprised serenity, look down And blush that you should ever have despair'd Of this brisk world! Thrice blessèd be the day When I remain'd behind you! For where else And, contemplating the incongruities of mortal life, in all its forms, Imagination assumes the character of Humour. Such creatures for my subjects could I find? Even in this little flower what force of will! And in the innumerable wills that throng The cramm'd earth's ever-teeming thoroughfares What force of folly! Dear, thou motley world, Dear to my doting heart, from mouse to man, Are all thy passionate progeny, who bait, With their own treacherous imaginings The empty traps that life to catch them sets! Never, wild children of the wilful earth, Will I desert you! Never shall you lack Mine unsuspected presence! Tho' disguised I go among you, under every mask, In every garb, in every age of time, And every realm that, roll'd thro' day and night, This wheeling orb spins round its frozen poles, Season your admiration for a while.— Horatio. Antics and merryandrews all of you, I claim you for mine own, and I am yours!” X. THE CROWN. No vapour veil'd the crimson-bosom'd West, The Eve of Saint Stephanos. Nor any cloudlet prematurely closed The last bright moment of the long bright day. But, lingering not to flush grey after-hours With faded fires, the glory at its best And brightest vanish'd; leaving the calm void Quietly colourless, as life's smooth face Of sober circumstance when love withdraws The glow that quicken'd it. 'Tis then, dim age Comes unresisted, overshadowing earth, Re-opening heaven, and o'er the lone repose Of its own darkness sheds a tender gleam Of cold tranquillity. Even so, forthwith The sudden night, with all her stars distinct, And her pure moonlight's spacious plenitude Of pallid splendour, wrapt the world, serene And luminous as the slumber of a god. Beyond the dreaded morrow of that night The Crown Princess is left alone with the Crown. Lurk'd throngs of unfamiliar faces, strange New paths untrodden, and days that nevermore In Diadema's island home should find Their dawning welcomed by the heart of a child. The King, her father, leaving her, had left His crown behind him, with a tremulous hand Pointed towards it, waved above her head A voiceless benison, and, murmuring “To-morrow!” sorrowfully stolen away, With that least sorrowful of all farewells. The suddenly before her Pilgram stood. Pilgram de coroná. His face was solemn as the face of Fate, And his voice stern and serious as the voice Of sad Experience. “Maiden,” said the god, “Yon crown will find its royal resting-place Upon thy brows to-morrow. Mark it well! It is a traveller that is never tired. The path it travels is above the heads Of princes. Every footstep is a king. When he that wore it last is dead, time turns His body to a sceptred statue. Fixt Forever on the road that statue rests So far as the dead king's last footstep reach'd; And there its monumental image points The progress of the nations, whose long march Is measured by those statues that were kings. The People occupies the plain of the world: Kings occupy its summits. Multiform As well as multitudinous, and made Of metamorphoses, the People is: From hour to hour 'tis other than it was: Youth imperceptibly effaces age: In a few years the People hath replaced The People, without violence, without Apparent movement: never may one say On this day, or on that, the People died, At one time, or another, it was born: Living and dying simultaneously, Its life is pass'd in dying, and it dies In giving birth unto itself: the grave Its birth-bed is: its cradle is a bier. Kings arrive singly, and one after one: Kings have successors: to the People time Grants but contemporaries: 'tis a crowd: Few of that crowd their own forefathers know But all know the forefathers of their Kings. It is because the People's memory Of its begetters is a memory merged In crown'd paternities of princely lines, That Kings the fathers of their People be. This law reverses nature's common rule: It finds the fathers by the children made. The Crown is sexless: those it rests upon Are neither male nor female: each is more Than man or woman: all of them are Kings. The People is the foliage of mankind: Its life the branches clothes, and its decay The soil enriches: blown by every wind, The People fluctuates, perishes, revives. Kings are the trunks. The tree is chronicled Not by its foliage: as the trunk, the tree: So many rings are reckon'd to the trunk, And to the tree as many years. To prove Its own antiquity the People counts The number of its Kings. From sire to son All Kings are brothers: and the youngest born Hath elder brothers that are centuries old. On summits only crowns repose; and each To all that is beneath it—all that serves For its support-significance imparts: The blossom crowns the summit of the stem, The snow the summit of the mountain crowns, The King the summit of the nation. Man Would be deprived of grandeur if his life Had nothing grand whereon to place a crown. And nothing grander will it ever have Than a grand King.” Thus spake the solemn god, The god's speech is, for the first time, unintelligible to the child. But at his summons interpreters arrive. Oracular. But his mysterious speech The maiden understood not. Then he touch'd Her brow, and breathed on it, and it became Throng'd with strange inmates. All her little head Humm'd like a mighty house made murmurous By a panic-stricken crowd. Doors oped and shut, Swift footsteps sped down passages and stairs, And eager hands flung wide the windows all. Parts of herself they seem'd that some bad news Had disconcerted, and in haste they sought Escape at every issue. Left behind, She felt them pass, and saw, or seem'd to see, Their fleeting forms, and heard, or seem'd to hear, Their plaintive calls, but chill'd to the heart's core By the cold seizure of a tyrannous trance Stood slack and dumb. And round her all the while, Rising and falling, sometimes in a storm Of lamentation and admonishment, Sometimes low lulling to a tremulous hush All but the lone appeal of one thin voice That thrill'd her thought with poignant music, made By mute vibrations on spiritual chords Intenser than all audible sound, they sang— King's Daughter, King's Daughter, beware Song without sound. Of the world where thou goest! For there Not a pleasure there is but it turns to a pain, Nor a sweetness that hides not a snare. Child whom we chose for our Queen, have we clung to thee Closer than childhood, yet clasp'd thee in vain? Dear and long due is the debt thou dost owe us! Wealth we have flung to thee, sciences sung to thee, Mingling with all that is purest in heaven All that is fairest on earth, we have given Gift upon gift to thee. Safe they belong to thee. Give them not thou to the hands that would stain, Desecrate, shatter, and thanklessly throw us Our gifts back again! To follow thee, I scaled thy sea-girt tower, Solo Allegro. The Sweetness of a flower in the soul of a child. And craggy bower. To follow thee was all my life's emprize. To follow thee, I braved the storm-blast's power, The lightning's lash, tho' but a feeble flower, Rootbound, and rock'd by Summer's faintest sighs. 'Twas love upheld, and help'd me, hour by hour, To rise and rise. To follow thee, I climb'd the gateless wall, And leapt the bridgeless moat. To follow thee, Secure where even the wild goat fears to fall, I clung, and swung, and camp'd my blithe buds all On rocks that house not even a hermit bee. One happy morn, in at thy lattice peeping, I found thee sleeping, And tapp'd, and tapp'd, till thou in shy amazement Didst wake, and listen, and fling wide the casement, And lo! I faced thee, Trembling all over, faint with having found thee! Thou didst lean o'er me, and mine arms went round thee, And I embraced thee! Clapping thy hands for gladness, thou did'st cry “What, is it thou? Madcap, how could'st thou dare to climb so high? Look down below! Think, hadst thou fallen?” “Many a fall had I,” Laughing, I answer'd, and made haste to show Where down the high crag's slippery pedestal My blossoms, trembling over an abyss, Dropp'd bloom on bloom. “And thus do blossoms fall,” I laughed, “like kiss on kiss!” Then didst thou understand me: and the whole Of my heart's secret, filling all thy frame, Thro' thy soft eyes slid into thy sweet soul, Where mine own soul a thought of thine became. Deep in thine eyes that thought may still be seen, Tho' by thyself it be unnoticed quite, Nor canst thou utter it. Let others guess! Some call me Grace, some call me Charm. I ween Blest will he be who one day wins the right To know me by my true name, Tenderness! King's Daughter, King's Daughter, beware Choral. Of the world where thou goest! For there Other gifts other givers will give thee, and fine Tho' each gift, in its core is a care. We are kings, and our kingdoms were tax'd for thy treasure: Of our sunbeams we built thee a palace of pleasure: With our moonbeams we lit thee a shrine: And the songs of the birds, and the sweets of the flowers, Sung and breathed in beatified worlds that are ours, Never counting the cost, never stinting the measure, We bestow'd on a world that was thine. I have no name. For they that know me best Solo Penseroso. The sadness of happy things. Know how to name me not. The nightingale Sings me when Summer nights are silentest, And the stars tremble, listening to her tale. Soft Melancholy's sweetest child am I, Sweeter than joy. I hover between song And silence. There is smiling in my sigh, And sighing in my smile. A thought among Thy thoughts, I wander, as a wind thro' flowers, And only by their tremors canst thou tell My secret influence on thy silent hours. Yet dost thou know me, child, and know me well. King's Daughter, King's Daughter, beware Choral. Of the world where thou goest! For there Is all mirth a mirage, ever mocking the drouth Of a desert deceitfully fair. In thy soul was the storehouse we sought For our gifts, gather'd out of the East And the West and the North and the South: And a gladness we breathed in thy breast, And a music we gave to thy mouth, And to each of thy gazes a star. Not a gift that we gave, but hath brought From the kingdoms whereof we are kings To thy spirit a loveliness, wrought Thro' the loom of its rich reveries Into feeling, and fancy, and thought. For the charm interwoven with these Hath the spell of all glamours that are In the magic whose mystery clings To the azure of summits and seas In the deeps of the distance afar; To the sound of low-murmuring trees, Lyric birds, and melodious springs; To the throb in the rose; To the violet's breath on the breeze: To the freshness that floats from Morn's opaline car; To the glory that burdens Noon's opulent wings; To the world of red wonders whose wizardry glows Thro' the glimmering gates of the sunset ajar; And the twilight's repose. Child, we are kings of all beautiful things, And thy heart was the home that we chose! Fainter upon the incorporeal sense Of her stretch'd spirit, from receding spheres, The voices fell. Immoveable and mute Stood Diadema, with white features fixt Fast as the dead leaves on a frozen pool, Arms outthrust, hands uplifted, lips and eyes Wide open. Rhoda at the King's approach Had left her: at the coming of the god The King departed: and the god himself, Sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.— Horatio. Soon as his finger on her forehead laid The troublous spell of its entrancing touch, Had suddenly vanisht into viewless air. XI. THE CORONATION. Alone, as she had never been before, Her mood will needs be pitied.— Horatio. Alone and conscious of her loneliness, And by that consciousness from head to foot Fill'd with a freezing fear, the maiden stood. Pilgram was gone, and gone her father: gone Her childhood's old glad careless confidence In life's untested welcomes: gone the time When round her, like a rich land's prodigal soil In a soft clime, the world with promise teem'd; When all things said “Thou may'st!” and none “Thou must!” When every song-bird caroll'd, “Life is love, And love is joy!” when all the hopeful air Was glowing with benignant prophecies, And every leaf and blossom laugh'd, “Rejoice!” When even tears were sweet as summer rains, And melancholy's sorrowfullest mood Only a kind of shadowy happiness. All these were gone: and, taking to itself Usurp'd possession of their empty place, The wiles wherewith Nature wheedles Youth to do her will. Her crown remain'd. The loveliness of youth, Itself so loving, yearns to be beloved Ere yet it finds the loved one, and youth's dreams Are all dim-throng'd with amorous presences That smile and beckon. But, while fervid steps Their smiles pursue, Fate's labyrinth unperceived Round the lured victim, coiling, shuts. And then, When happiness hath grown a habit, hope A faith, and love the element of both, Out of the heart of the maze her oracle speaks The Inevitable No; that, whether breathed Prohibition is coeval with Paradise; where all said “Yes” till Prohibition spoke. The voice of it followed man's footsteps into the wilderness, which then became his world: a world filled with the terrors of that voice. But of its many mandates one only is inevitable. All prohibitions upon Sin man has evaded. The prohibition upon Happiness he cannot evade. This is the Inevitable No; which transfers Freedom, with all its felicities, from the realm of Reality to that of the Ideal. Light as the whispers of a sleeping child, Or loud as thunder peal'd, all promise turns To prohibition, puckers to a frown Earth's smile, strikes sunless the bright vault of heaven, And famine-smites the fruitful tracts of time. The loved one's coming tears, not kisses, greet; And the poor heart's forbidden welcome faints Unutter'd upon lips that wail “Farewell!” Voices that laugh'd, “Rejoice!” exclaim, “Renounce!” Along the desert air, where no bird sings, A pining wind laments, “Life is not love, But duty, and love is not joy, but pain!” And all things say, “Thou must!” and none, “Thou may'st!” Change comes with age: but it is we that change, And not the world's conditions. Our desires Dwindle: our will deliberately shifts Its chosen mark, exerting none the less Its liberty of choice: the shorten'd aim Requites the slacken'd effort: from without No enigmatic mandate disallows Their free selection of the mark itself To faculties retaining all their force: And the slow years along the downward slope Of compensated loss so softly lead Life's gradual descent that, looking back, Never at any time can age recall The date of youth's departure. But this change Comes otherwise, comes wholly unprepared, Suddenly in the heyday of youth's heats, When every pulse is fullest, every nerve Most sensitive to pleasure and to pain. It comes with the intolerable shock Of the soul's first discovery of Fate's strength And her own impotence: leaves all within Unchanged, unweaken'd, and unreconciled To the drear change of all without—the same Wild energy of will, the same strong need Of life and love, the same capacity To feel, the same simplicity of faith In pre-establisht harmonies between Feeling and fact; but all at once no more The same fair, welcoming, wide-open world Of high and happy possibilities Awaiting their possession. Chill eclipse Descends on all. The reassuring smile Of a benignant Providence departs, And, in its stead, hangs everywhere the frown Of some grim barbarous Demon Power that wills And loves not, claiming for its dismal rites The victim and the sacrifice. Even then, Born brave, and nurtur'd upon nobleness, The young heart (still too young to guess the worst That Fate intends it), like a king dethroned, Whose kingliness, even when unkingdom'd, clothes Calamity itself with grace august, Would fain devote its proud sublimities Of feeling to the adornment of despair; Feasting its famine upon sacrifice, Slaking its fervid thirst of joys forbid On torrents of inebriating tears, Converting desolation to a dower, Pain to an appanage, and wringing thus The rapture of a high enthusiasm Even from the cold grey helplessness of grief. In vain! The Inevitable No denies To unhappiness no less than happiness The luxury of passion: and again Out of the heart of the maze the oracle speaks: “Not all at once, impulsive Child of Earth, Nor once for all, thy sacrifice shall be! But thou shalt mortify and mutilate Thyself, piecemeal, on altars many and mean, Little by little, to the end of life. And when the equivalence of littleness In suffering and enjoyment, good and ill, Hath re-establisht life's lost harmonies Of fact and feeling in a lower tone, When the subservient spirit no longer craves Aught that the common and convenient course Of circumstance denies it, death shall loose With sudden hand a bond grown tolerable, Remove a burden lighten'd by long use, And to the crippled pinions, that have lost Their power to soar, set wide the narrow cage Which shelter'd Custom's creature from the vague, Wild, fearful, unfamiliar Infinite.” To Diadema in that frozen trance In captivity. Fate's Oracle had spoken its first word; And round her crown's hard hollow circlet, husht With horror, died away in a dumb void The faint unanswer'd voices of the past. But, thro' the silence of all others, sweet As Eden's nightingale when still the rose The old song. Was thornless, one dear solitary voice Of tenderest tone sang to her from afar, Singing of love, and love's infinitudes Of feeling. To a world of finite fact Fetter'd, she heard it as a captive hears Thro' prison grates, in some far foreign land, A voice that calls him in his native tongue, And at the extreme tether of his chain Falls in vain effort to escape. A few Short footsteps reach'd the limit of her power To follow the sweet summons of that song. Her crown still held in her unconscious hands, Out thro' her chamber's unshut casement, drawn As one that walks in dreams, she stagger'd. There, Down in its rose-girt balcony she sank Along her purple-pillow'd ivory couch, Letting her crown into her listless lap Sink unregarded also. Low, between The moonlit blossoms of the balustrade, Her drooping cheek on her clasp'd hands she lean'd, And listen'd, sick at heart. A little breeze Began to make a sighing trouble among Those moonlit blossoms. Ever and anon Fell o'er her, here a blossom, there a leaf; And with the leaves and blossoms, as they fell, Her tears fell too, thawing her frozen trance. The distant voice sang on. But with its song A singer far away, and a whisperer near at hand: Another and a nearer voice, that breathed Close at her ear importunate, interfused Mysterious tones. It was the Poppy's voice, Appealing to her for the crown he craved. “Maiden,” it whisper'd, “give thy crown to me, With all its cares, and I will give thee love, With all its joys!” And, as she listen'd, her heart Swell'd fuller, and beat faster, and she felt The lightening and the loosening of a load Of ponderous impossibilities. The whisper of the Poppy, with its word Whose Combined influence affects the emancipation of the Captive Princess Of mystic promise, penetrating all The music of Love's passionate psalm, became More potent upon her spirit than the power Of Fate's imperative oracle. A soul Secure of happiness, in some high sphere Of unassail'd serenity, she heard Faint echoes of the Inevitable No Falling far down a dim escaped abyss Of evitable and evaded doom That gaped beneath her, and their menace seem'd Abortive as a dying beldam's curse. Between her and the singer of the song And the union of two lovers. Whose music mingled with the lulling spells Breathed by the Poppy, all distance disappear'd, All separation ceased. The song itself, Assuming personality, became One with the singer, and the singer and she One with each other; in whose oneness lived, Reciprocally realized, the full Felicitous actuality of all The song but sang of—strength and tenderness, Passion and purity, beyond the reach Of ruinous time and rancorous circumstance, In a transcendent everlasting dream Of love united. From the maiden's lap Coronation of King Poppy. Down slid the crown the Poppy craved, and bruised His goblin brow. Thence issued troops of dreams, Whose giant power its weight uplifted, set Its heavy splendours on his florid crest, And with miraculous transmutation turn'd Its dwindling golden hoop, and the small head Beneath it, to a tawny capsule hard, Encircled by the semblance of what they Who are themselves but semblances of power Wear for the symbol of it. From this hard And tawny capsule leapt two lucid beads That fell into the maiden's eyes. Her lids Droop'd slowly, closing o'er them, and she slept. Slept, and still sleeps: a maiden princess sleeping For ever in a palace by the sea! Over the sleeping maiden lightly stoop'd His kingdom's first visitant. King Poppy. Both her lidded eyes he kiss'd, And whisper'd to her, “King's Daughter, enter in! Enter the happy realm whereof thy hand Hath crown'd me monarch! Here thy home behold! Here shalt thou dwell forever beautiful, Forever blest; and here forever thine Those gifts shall be, the god who gave them hid Deep in the innocent heart my power preserves Stainless, and still unbroken: radiant forms, The fields of Fancy roaming, crown'd with flowers From faëry gardens gloriously adorn'd By all the summers of the Golden Age; Sweet thoughts that wander, sinless as the streams That water'd Paradise, thro' worlds as fair And far away as Paradise itself; Bright tendernesses ever flowing from Unfathomable founts of sympathy; Beauty that time hath blemish'd not, and love That life hath not dishonour'd. Safe and pure As dwells the starry essence of the dew Shut in the unsullied bosom of a rose, Sleep, maiden, sleep! To thee shall woeful eyes And weary hearts for consolation turn, When slumber locks eyelashes tired with tears On cheeks still wet with weeping, and sad souls Are guided blindfold to the Land of Dreams. Here, as, imploring refuge from the world, My realm and thine their weary steps approach, Do thou life's wayworn travellers welcome home, And lead them to the regions of their rest!” The Shepherd, on a moonlit peak, his song The lost song. Unanswer'd, and his soul in wild suspense, Stood waiting for a voice that ne'er till then Had fail'd to answer, in a thousand tones Of infinitely varied tenderness For ever new, the selfsame question fond, With the same fond assurance, “I am thou!” The soul's pursuits, whether in life or art, are preceded by an ideal possession of the object pursued. For to the soul pure perception is in the nature of undisturbed possession: nor can she seek what she does not miss, or miss what she has not known. But this state of the soul is simply receptive; and the conditions of her physical tenement render it necessarily transient. The cessation of it is followed by a state of unrest; wherein the sense of missed possession begets the need of attainment, and therewith passion, the agent of that need. The first is a state of passive enjoyment; the second, one of painful activity. Attainment, however, extinguishes passion in the possession of the object attained; and in relation to that object the soul again finds rest: what the faculties employed by her present as an act of acquisition, being to the soul herself an act of recovery. Perception, preceding desire; desire, compelling attainment; and attainment, restoring perception; these three states comprise the history of what his work is to the artist, his love to the lover, his system to the philosopher: in so far, at least, as the Imaginative Power is concerned with the development, in the individual, of art, philosophy, or love. Strange and uncommon seems to each in turn His own first portion of life's common pain: But cruellest is the pang of the surprise When what hath been a long-familiar sense Of undefinable felicity, Whose beatific influence erewhile In some young heart made hovering music heard, And, soft as sunny haze at morning, mantled That one poor heart's whole habitable world In fervid veils that all harsh features hid, And all dark hollows fill'd with golden cloud, A single miserable moment turns Into a definite and acute despair, Crying aloud, “My name is Love! Secure Within thy spirit's penetralian shrine I lurk'd unchallenged, till at last I learn'd Its inmost secrets. Thou, who all the while Didst neither know thyself, nor them, nor me, By every other name that is not mine Hast call'd me; and in many a borrow'd form Upon thy heart I, unforbidden, fed Till I gain'd strength to break it. Know me now, For what I am! Love, stronger than before, Being full-grown, craving more nourishment. I hunger. I am starving. I am wild. My power is pitiless, my need immense, And thou art at my mercy. Give me food Give me thy heart to gnaw, thy life to rend And ravage! In return, one gift have I Still left to give thee, tho' all else be gone, The dreadful gift of Knowledge-known-too-late! Thou shalt not ever hear her voice again, And thou dost love her. Thou shalt never hold Her hand in thine, nor press thy lips to hers, And thou dost love her. Never shalt thou gaze Upon her face, save in a hopeless dream, And thou dost love her. Thou hast loved her long, And didst not know it. Thou hast lost her now, And, knowing thou hast lost her, knowest too How dearly thou didst love her, and dost love!” This was the only voice the Shepherd heard. It came to him from his own frighten'd heart, Startling and terrible, as at dead of night, When feasted revellers rest, and streets are still, Thro' some soft slumbering city that hath been Betray'd while it caroused, a trumpet sounds, Blown by the invader, and a wild voice cries, “Awake! The foe is in the citadel, The gods are stolen away, and all is lost!” And he awoke out of his broken dream Of undefended happiness, and sat Forlorn among the ruins of it, and felt That something, which till then had been the soul Of all things else, was gone; and nothing else The loss of it had left alive in him But a blind, voiceless, desolate desire Far from his undone self to fly away; Athwart the world's indifferent darkness chasing Evasive echoes of a silenced song Whose distant singer's inmost soul to his Had all its secrets in that song outpour'd. His little but upon the upland lawns The passionate Pilgrim. He left, and all his flocks and herds forsook. His loins he girt, and from the stony ridge Rush'd, like a mountain cataract sudden rains Have swollen, upon the valleys with a cry. Flying, his pastoral pipe he flung away, For broken was the music of his life, And flung away his shepherd crook, for all His shepherdings were ended. Flint and briar Obstacles oppose his pilgrimage, and perils beset it: Stay'd not his flight, nor the dividing sea. Into its moaning deeps he plunged, and swam Dauntless as young Leander, tho' for him No torch was kindled, and no Hero watch'd. Strong was the violent strait that roll'd between The mainland and the islet crags whence safe The song he miss'd had found erewhile its way. But to him, seeking thro' the waters wild That lost song's hidden birthplace, way was none Safe from the hundred thousand hands of Death, That snatch'd, and clutch'd, and slipp'd, and snatch'd again. Headlong at last upon a savage beach The breaker hurl'd him senseless, but anon Suck'd back, and toss'd from roaring ridge to ridge Of smoky surf, till in its strenuous lap But chance, favouring the vague direction of his efforts, brings him close to the goal when he is least conscious of having approached it. The tide-wave's southward-streaming current caught, And roll'd him round the rocky isle, and laid His body, bleeding, bruised, but breathing still, In a soft bay beneath the summer moon. There, blowing over myrtle bowers, sweet airs Breathed on his swoon, and waked it. He arose The stupor which follows protracted and seemingly abortive struggle is a period of unperceived refreshment: and, reviving from it, he at last sees clear before him the requital of all his paios, in the living embodiment of a never-relinquished ideal. and the perfect beauty of its form. As one that, having perish'd on the rack, Revives in Paradise. Around him bloom'd The Eden of his dreams, and o'er him smiled The heaven of all his hopes. A giant crag, Cleft from the rocky root of it in twain, Loom'd imminent above him. One huge peak (The highest but least inaccessible) Rough with wild shrubs and pendulous parasites, Held, poised in heaven, upon its aëry top The large round moon. The other and lesser limb Of that deep-riven rampart, from its base Low-branching, pedestall'd a shadowy pile Of masonry fantastically heap'd In terrace upon terrace superposed. Wall overtopping wall, and dome from dome Emergent in a maze of pinnacles, All unapproachable. From whose dim midst Uprose a single supereminent tower; And, in the highest story of it set, A spacious lamp-lit window, balconied Broad at the vase with golden balustrade O'er-clamber'd by the revelling rose, shone bright. The glory, from that window pouring, paused Upon the rose-girt balcony, and wove A reverential aureole round about One image—hers, the lady of the isle, In her lone loveliness. The Shepherd's star Stay'd there, above the recompensing shrine Of his wild pilgrimage: for there at last Song's tenderest importunities were blest With all the gladness of a granted prayer, And love's most passionate prophecies fulfill'd. His limbs were sore and shaken, soak'd and torn His garments, but no pain nor weariness Survived that vision. Deep beatitude Bathed his delighted spirit, and a new sense Of life, from suffering suddenly released, Flutter'd blithe wings within him like a bird. With faculties quickened by confidence in the perception of an attainable end, he again aspires. With nimble foot and dexterous hand he climb'd The higher cliff, whose tangled thickets creak'd And crackled where from branch to branch he swung Swift as a stormy wind: beneath his foot The mountain's stony litter, loosen'd, sprang, And down its craggy channels roaring roll'd Into unseen abysses: snaky roots, Tugg'd by his snatching hand, within its grasp Snapp'd: but safe onward sped the mountaineer; Such salient springs of lightness in his heart, Uplifting and upholding him, impell'd His passionate course. The overwhelming Pan, Whose hidden presence fill'd those shaggy heights With sudden horrors and bewilderments, Dismay'd him not; nor could earth's sullen power Subordinate to its down-dragging stress The ascendant spirit that etherealized His earthly frame, wherein the fire of life Burn'd with a self-consuming brightness, fann'd To finer fervours by the breath of love. At last, with nought between him and the moon And, reaching the highest point of possible achievement. finds Save the dark-purple ether's breathing dome, He stood elate. Thence, gazing, he beheld Close underneath him, nor beyond his reach More than a few short arm-lengths—lone, as dwells The little glow-worm in its own soft gleam Enhalo'd,—on a lamp-lit ivory couch Gem-crusted, purple-cushion'd, girt about By a broad golden balcony, and embower'd Among rose-blossoms (she, a rose in bud) —Among profuse rose-blossoms and among Husht leaves embower'd, where all around her throbb'd Night's palpitant purities and poesies Of starlight, stillness, darkness, solitude, And summer (a poem of purity herself) —The maiden Princess sleeping. Snowy white Shone her soft throat and lucid shoulder bare, And snowy white, from breast to ankle fine, In wavy slopes her sweeping vesture flow'd Along her faultless form. One sweet small foot From the plain fold that hid its fellow peep'd In jewell'd slipper, sparkling to the moon: One slender hand above her fallen crown Hover'd, a drooping flower: the other propp'd Her pale cheek, pillow'd on its rosy palm. Above the purple-cushion'd couch, and close To the still maiden's tender ear, pale-lipp'd, With writhing neck, in thin green garment clad, Like a wan goblin bent beneath the weight Of Elfland's gifts (his unawakening hand Upon the pillow of its darling child Must lay in haste ere morn's return) low crouch'd A great white poppy; and from its luminous core, As from the unseen flame of a wizard lamp, Veil'd splendours all her slumbrous face suffused. Her vagrant tresses, from the braided pearl That bound them, loosen'd by low-breathing airs, Wander'd in floating ripples upon the wave That heaved her virgin bosom. The starr'd heavens, Fill'd with unfathomable mystery, hung Above her and about her, glimmering, Trembling, and whispering, as tho' their winds Were lull'd, their depths of lustrous darkness all With odours laden, and their mazy stars In myriads kindled, but to minister To the secluded charm of her repose. He, too, sole human witness of a sight So wildly dream'd of and so dearly won, Hung o'er her, almost touch'd her—and yet knew That still 'twixt him and her was an abyss! O'er that abyss, the one last hindrance left He attains; and, in the attainment, perishes; Between love's indefatigable course And its complete attainment, an abyss So narrow, yet to foot of mortal man Impassable as is the little grave Whose gap uncross'd keeps Earth and Heaven apart, The Shepherd stretch'd imploring arms, embraced The bounteous vision, from his mountain ledge Leapt desperately down; and at her feet, Whose loveliness his life had from afar Divined and sought, death laid him lovingly; But perishing, is saved. Suffering his wounded head to sink and rest On her sweet bosom, folding round her close His dying arms, and in libation pouring (To consecrate their bridal bower) the blood Of the brave heart whose strong life's passionate stream, No longer pent, to its dear Naïad bore The last fond tribute of adoring love. Red gems it added to her royal crown, And the pale Poppy guarding that great prize It dyed deep crimson. So the Poppy gain'd The investiture of King Poppy. The kingly symbols he had coveted, A purple mantle, and a golden crown. But Sorrow gave him one, and Death the other. Over the dying boy King Poppy bent, His Kingdom's second visitant. Beneath his closing eyelids softly dropp'd Two lucid beads, and whisper'd, “Enter in, Poor shepherd boy who loved a monarch's child! Enter the blissful realm whereof thy blood Hath robed me king, and here in safety dwell, Forever loving, and forever loved! Here shall thy life be great and glorious, thou Who wast on earth poor, nameless, and obscure! Hither, my happy kingdom to adorn, O herdsman's son, bear with thee unimpair'd The single treasure of thy true young heart! That love elsewhere impossible, elsewhere Hopeless, shall here be hail'd the only love Perfectly possible, the only one Perfectly true, the only one that lasts Fervid and fresh forever. King henceforth Thou art, and bravely kingdom'd; for no less Than kings are all my subjects, and to thee The first and fairest of mine own wide realms Is given in kingly guerdon. Here shall come, Thy royal kinship claiming, the scorn'd souls Of poets who, like thee, have nought but love To give away, and give it all ungrudged Tho' unrequited—save when life is o'er. Young Shepherd King, thy maiden bride embrace! Thy shepherd boy, young Maiden Queen, console! Reign happy, reign together, sovereigns both Of Dreamland's youngest province! People it With lovelinesses rescued from a world That loves not, solacing its paths with song Elsewhere unheard! Call hither from afar The loving, and the lonely, and the lost, He was a goodly King.— Horatio. And lead them to the regions of their rest!” XII. THE CONSTITUTION. Reckon'd events to the unreckon'd end This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.— Horatio. Fate urges, foiling forethought. When the day Prophetic hopes or prescient fears foretold Is come at last, it finds us unprepared, Or else in all our preparations wrong. Vainly upon the Present's private stage The action of the Future is rehearsed: Soon as the prompter's final call-bell sounds, And the great curtain rises, ten to one That all the players have forgot their parts. Mylady's pincushion, tho' planted thick With pins of all sorts daily, pinless proves Just when the important ball-dress is put on, And Mylord's coach kept waiting at the door. You hear your regiments are undermann'd, Only the morning after war's declared: Not till the men are well upon their march, You learn your soldiers have not shoes enough. Battles are never won, but always lost, By something, all things turn on, turning out So as to overturn the best design Turn'd over by the wisest heads before. All premature, the long-expected comes. Scarce plann'd, your public charter is proclaim'd, And ere the first word's writ the last is read. The night when royally King Poppy assumed Public Expectation Serene possession of his promised realm Was follow'd by a memorable morn. To greet that morn the streets of Diadum Were gay with flowers, the roofs with flags, and blithe With pealing joybells all the belfries clang'd; While round the palace flocks of loyal folk Were struggling with each other for a sight Of something which not one of them could see. For it had been officially made known That the Crown Princess would this morn attain Her full majority. Confused reports, Moreover, had been current, that the King Would probably soon after abdicate In favour of his daughter—might, indeed, Some hinted, take occasion of the day Her Royal Highness came of age, to announce This long-surmised intention. But the hour Disappointed. When the Crown Princess ought to have appear'd Upon a balcony was pass'd, and still Of her approach no bellowing batteries gave The appointed signal to the drums and fifes Ready since dawn to strike up “Old King Cole.” The gunners, tired, beside their linstocks stood. Their matches had been lighted long ago, And every one of them was half burnt out. Noticing this, the General in Command, With his unfailing practical good sense, Sent to the arsenal for fresh supplies Of matches. But by singular ill luck Deficiency in the military stores. The country had been several years at peace; And the last batch of matches, made in haste When the last war was over, had been all Used up in fireworks to commemorate The seventieth anniversary of the day The King recover'd from the chicken-pox. The Aide-de-camp, however, who was charged On this occasion with the delicate task Of fetching matches from an arsenal Completely matchless, recognized how much The national artillery would lose In public estimation if it fail'd To make a noise. So, clapping spur forthwith Brilliant exploit of a young officer. Into his charger, off he rode full speed Till, round the corner, in the nick of time He reach'd the next apothecary's shop, And a forced requisition of pastilles Made on the premises. For these he paid By drafts upon the Extraordinary Fund For “Measures To-Be-Taken-When-Too-Late.” That Chapter of the Budget was, he knew, Better provided for than all the rest— Thanks to the forethought and experience Of the War Minister. The Aide-de-camp, Merit rewarded In consequence of this exploit, received The Order of “The Jumping Cow and Moon,” By means of which he jump'd above the heads To the detriment of Seniority. Of fifteen senior officers. Fourteen Were married, and the fifteenth officer Had sixteen children. The dragoon was seen Returning from the apothecary's shop With headlong haste, his horse in a white sweat: 'Twas also noticed that he lost no time In handing to the Chief Staff Officer A packet, which that officer received With the unmoved composure that betrays A deep anxiety. But all surmise The apparition comes.— Horatio. About the inaction of the troops was stopp'd By the appearance of a personage Not mention'd in the programme. Suddenly The Master of the Royal Printing House Arrived, preceded by the Fire Brigade With ladders, and the Engineers with pots And brushes: who placarded all the walls And posts, for miles and miles, with spacious sheets Of paper, printed in colossal type. And at the head of each huge poster, black In a vast blank, as in its desert stands The giant Sphinx, stood one enormous word. That word was— CONSTITUTION! A new publication, which becomes a popular periodical. Under it Follow'd, low down, in lesser capitals “We Diadummianus”—(These two words In every royal proclamation came Invariably first. The public eye Noticed, however, with surprise that here The next two of the sentence that began “We Diadummianus” were “The Last.”) The proclamation then continued thus, “Considering”— 'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.— Horatio. But everybody now, Without consideration, knows by heart The general principles and special points Consider'd at considerable length In that great document; whose text contain'd Numerous guarantees, proclaim'd in terms By numerous Modern States adopted since These hands are not more like.— Horatio. Verbatim. Everything was guaranteed, Except the guaranteeing guarantee Of all the guarantees that constitute A Model Constitution. Still life.When the King, With heavy heart and hesitating step, To fetch his daughter back to Diadum That morning sought her island bower, he found The maiden sleeping. On her bosom glow'd A scarlet poppy, like the signet set Upon a princely secret. Robed in white, Smiling asleep she lay; and from her soft Half-open lips melodious murmurings Floated, as from the petals of a flower That in its happy bosom hides the bee. The porphyry table, on whose coverlet (rich With silver brede enwrought) his hand had left The unloved crown that was to have been hers, Some magic of the midnight hours had turn'd Into what seem'd a rose-red marble tomb; About the base, in milk-white groups emboss'd, The progress of a pastoral idyll wound, And as it went its simple love-tale told In silence to the silent solitude; Upon the top, supine (a life-like form, But in the stillness of its sculptured grace Fairer than life, and on its marble lips The perdurable sweetness of a smile Sweeter than young Endymion's slumbering In the embrace of the enamour'd moon) Reposed the image of a shepherd boy, Whose face was to the maiden tenderly Turn'd, as her own to him. Beside the couch Dame Rhoda sat; and in her wither'd hands One little hand she held, whose fingers fine The dreaming child had curl'd confidingly Within her nursing clasp, as if to say, “Wake me not! I am happy. All is well.” Dispersion and migration of Ballad Song, which preserves the dreams of Childhood in the traditional utterances of Eld. Into her listening ear the child's warm lips Were murmuring stories of her own sweet dreams; And what they murmur'd the old woman sang Low to herself, and singing half asleep; For to herself the rhythmic monotone Of her own voice, repeating chronicles Of dreamland, was a lullaby. But light The breeze that fann'd the flowery casement caught That low lone strain, and in its bosom bore The burden of it, with strange sea-sounds blent, Over the broad blue waters far away To distant lands: where here and there, in husht And lonely places, others listening heard, And in their own tongue sang it o'er again; Even as the imitative woods repeat From leaf to leaf in language of their own The murmur'd message of the wandering wind, Come whence it may. The old woman warningly A finger lifted to her lips. The old man, Without a word, upon the other side Of the child's couch sat down, and 'twixt his own He took her other hand, and his bent head Sank low and lower till his white beard brush'd His quiet knees. Nothing he understood Of what had happen'd or was happening there; But now and then along his wrinkled cheek A big tear roll'd. Meanwhile, in Diadum A sealed compact, well ratified by law and heraldry.— Horatio. The Cabinet was waiting for the King, When Pilgram suddenly arrived—alone. But to the Ministers he brought an Act Of Abdication, by His Majesty Written and sign'd that morning. 'Twas, in truth, A document they secretly had long Been hoping for: but on receiving it They all express'd their sorrowful surprise And deep regret. A message, Pilgram said, Too confidential for delivery Except by word of mouth, he had been charged To lose no time in giving them. The King, He then informed them, was departed—bound On a long journey to a distant land, Whence distant, too, the date of his return, And doubtful. Probably not one of them Would ever see His Majesty again. The Princess had been dead nigh sixteen years, She having died the year that she was born. The King in this calamity had foreseen The extinction of his dynasty, but still Deem'd that it was his duty to preserve The monarchy if possible. Profound Attention to the Genius of the Age Had led His Majesty to recognize That, soon or late, the symbol of a faith Is all that can remain of it; and men Are mostly to the symbol more attach'd Than to whate'er the symbol represents. So have I heard, and do in part believe it.— Horatio. But simply as a symbol to exist, Some image, even if made of wood or stone, Was more effectual than a human heart Whose personal palpitations might disturb The impersonal passivity that best Befits a symbol. Being well aware Of what the circumstances of the State Seem'd to require, the venerable King (Who felt the infirmities of age increased By sorrow for his child's untimely death) Had charged him, Master Pilgram, to construct A Government Machine, expressly made And fitted with the necessary gear For carrying on the business of the realm With regularity. Now, this machine, The greatest invention of the age. Said Pilgram, was a puppet, that imposed So perfectly on public confidence Its representative contrivances, That it had long successfully replaced Her Royal Highness, the dead Princess. They Themselves had seen it, and conversed with it, And they could testify to its success In meeting the requirements of the age. “This puppet,” he continued, moving not A muscle at his auditors' surprise, “This puppet by the public is supposed To be the real Princess: and, indeed, The puppet is extremely popular. Living princesses sometimes go astray. The Puppet-Princess never will contract A misalliance; nor, if rightly work'd, Act counter to whatever rules are framed For its procedure. It is warranted Complete in all its necessary parts; And, should its clockworks ever need repair, (For even the best-made puppets now and then Get out of order) they are so contrived As to be mended, modified, or even In case of need completely recomposed From any sort of cheap material, By the most clumsy workman. It will be Prudent, however, to keep these details A secret. Leave the People's honest faith In salutary error undisturb'd. Never reveal the unreality Of puppets that are popular. Meanwhile, Your Excellencies will not find it hard To govern in the room, retaining still (If my advice you take) the form august, Of a Departed Royalty. The shades And echoes of Departed Royalty Lend solemn influence to the hollow forms They haunt for ages. Be upon your guard! The People, an incorrigible dunce, Is quick to feel, tho' slow to understand; And, in its awkward fits of sentiment, Stupid enough, and strong enough, alas, So shall you hear of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, and in this upshot purposes mistook.— Horatio. The blockhead is, to break the best contrived Mechanical arrangements for its good. It is on such occasions that the want Of a true king may possibly be felt. But then, they do not happen every day; And nobody must in this world expect Perfection. For perfection you will find My puppet is a perfect substitute.” The Ministers, when their astonishment, Pilgram declines a seat in the Cabinet. On learning how they had themselves been duped, Sufficiently subsided to allow Of calm reflection, saw that Pilgram's plan Had much to recommend it. They express'd With cordiality their confidence In his abilities, and offer'd him A place in the new Cabinet. But this His modesty forbade him to accept, He told them; adding, “One small favour grant, But obtains for Liberty a place in the Constitution. And I shall be contented. Prove yourselves Enlighten'd liberal statesmen, and proclaim Liberty, as a fundamental part Of the new Constitution!” Much amazed, Their duty was, they said, imperative To punish all presumptuous attempts At taking any sort of liberty With the new Constitution: and they ask'd What, in the name of Common Sense, he meant? He answer'd, with a deprecating smile, “Your Excellencies are about to start A Government exclusively maintain'd Upon appearances, and what appears Most liberal, looks best. But, after all, The little that I ask means nothing much. Liberty is a word in common use: I have a fancy for the sound of it. Oblige me on this point!” Then to himself, “By Jupiter, ”he mutter'd, “an escape! I very nearly had allow'd the door Of the new Constitution to be shut Unceremoniously in mine own face, By stupidly forgetting to insert Something fantastic into it.” The news Popular rejoicings. Forthwith was circulated everywhere Of the King's abdication, and the Chart Accepted in advance by the new Queen, Proclaiming that henceforth the principle Of Diadummianian Government Would be entirely Representative. The populace hurrah'd, the joy-bells rang, The cannon bang'd and blazed, and all the realm Was thrown into a rapture of delight. Pilgram, meanwhile, behind closed doors unveil'd The Pseudo-Sovereign, gave the Ministers What is the issue of the business there?— Horatio. A few short simple lessons in the trick Of the State Mechanism, and explain'd Its structure. This was all that they required; For they were most intelligent, and seized Upon the principle of the machine Instinctively. Another little wheel He then inserted. This new wheel henceforth It would be necessary to wind up Once every year. 'Twas call'd “The-Queen's-Speech-Wheel.” Thus was accomplish'd, without one blow struck Or drop of blood shed, in the favour'd Realm Of Diadummiania, that great And glorious Revolution which so far Surpass'd all other wonderful events In wonder that, tho' many of course have tried, And some profess'd, not any one has been Able to understand it ever since. The best historians seriously aver It was the work of Spirits. And they call Those Spirits, one, the Spirit of the Age, The other one, the Spirit of Progress. Still, As nobody knows what those Spirits are, This explanation leaves it unexplain'd. Pilgram from Diadum, before the sun Had set upon that memorable day, Departed. He was never seen again, That is most certain.— Horatio. And is forgotten. But his work remains. It has since then been imitated much. EPILOGUE. TRANSFIGURATION. Pilgram, when he had shaken hands with all Exit Pilgram. The members of the Puppet Government, And wish'd them good success, regain'd the isle, Where sleeping, and for evermore asleep, Safe guarded by King Poppy, he had left The Princess, and her father, and the dame. His workshop in the palace of the King He emptied, first, of all its wizard toys; And all the marvellous machinery That to those creatures of his fancy once Gave living motion, in a broken heap He buried, that hereafter none might guess The secret of his craft. With steps that sped Flashing on their invisible course, and fleet As the untrack'd, unutterable thoughts That burn and vanish thro' the dazzled brain Of some bewilder'd poet, from the wreck His hand had made of all its handiwork In Diadum, the radiant wanderer pass'd Back to the island bower his spells had built, For the asylum of the souls he loved. The secret path to it he then destroy'd, Since those 'twas made for needed it no more. Nor ever again shall foot of mortal man That pathway tread; whence under sea and land, No longer now as mortal man disguised, But in his full effulgence, Phantasos Enter Phantasos. Return'd to visit Diadema's dreams. And when the god to her still chamber came, The Sleeping Palace. No sound was in it save the crone's low chaunt, With, ever and anon, a fitful note Wailing from some stray'd fly's small phantom horn; Nor any motion but the maiden's breath That, undulating her calm slumber, sway'd (There in its snowy cradle sleeping too) The crimson-petall'd Poppy upon her breast. On one side of his daughter's ivory couch The Old King sat, and on the other side Sat the Old Dame, both sleeping; and between Those sleepers, as between two hoary rocks That overhang it sleeps a little tarn So still and pure that all the lights of heaven In its pure stillness smile, the maiden slept. Harmonious with these three husht images Of perfect peace, the lucid effigy Of the dead Shepherd Boy, who perish'd there For love of the King's Daughter, seem'd to breathe Warm life as, streaming from the fervent west, The rich Hesperian hues of sunset flush'd Its pale marmorean beauty. Sleep and Death Smiled the same smile. Their secret was the same. Phantasos, round him gazing, sigh'd, “Behold The legacy of Phantasos. All my redeeming providence could save From life's perpetual suicide! A few Imperishable forms of perisht faiths In its fantastical divinity; A few illusions that, unlost, endure, As types of its endurance, in the fond Tradition of an immemorial time That was not, save as in such types it is Forever, ever seeming to have been; When Majesty was childlike, Childhood still God-guarded, and itself the guardian god Of age, in old days that were young ones; earth A dreamland; miracles, familiar facts; Speech, song; faith, truth; and truth, a fairy tale!” About the sleeping forms he gazed upon The glimmering air grew darker. Fast outside The sunset deepen'd. All in a dim glow Was fading. O'er his countenance divine, Contemplating his own achievement, stole The solemn shadow of a power put forth, And past away from its creative source Forever into that which it creates. He mused, “My work is done. But will they last, The gifts I leave behind me, ere again Back to my wanderings thro' the world I go? Be that the care of Mekon! In his guard Confided to the care of Mekon I leave them, who knows how to keep my gifts. Here, in each silent image, sleeps a fount Of fancy-fertilizing song, that waits For its discoverer only. And anon, For transmission and distribution. When there shall be not even one small isle Unsearch'd in Ocean's solitary lap; When there shall be no longer any kings Whose beards have whiten'd on ancestral thrones; No longer any shepherds whose young hearts Heave with the aspirations that uplift The lid this heavy world shuts down on all Else like to trouble its dull dreamless sloth; No longer in mysterious bowers (redeem'd From Beauty's common curse, self-consciousness) Maidens with mystic crowns to give away, Nor any mystery left in maid or crown; That song shall keep men dreaming of them, taught Unalter'd by traditionary Eld To wondering Childhood: or, when Childhood's voice Is still'd, and autumn's waning suns scarce warm The later lonesome days, in alter'd tones (Not glad, and confident, and effortless, But burden'd with the weight of tears, like winds Rain-laden, tho' still sweet, still solacing, Because they breathe from happier climates) sung By lips grown pale beneath hope's faithless kiss To hearts too soon, too often, and too late By love set beating: and from age to age, As in its last descendants live, tho' changed, The ancestral features of a high-born race, Lays, that without it had not been, shall still, Even tho' unconscious of their ancestry, Renew the living echoes of that song. Mekon,” the god exclaim'd, “awake! arise! 'Tis Phantasos that calls thee.” And the flower Enter King Poppy. Rose slowly, slowly, on its slender stem, Whose root had reach'd into the maiden's heart. Between the crimson petals, that unclosed Above it with a husht enraptured thrill, Peep'd a small face, beaming beatitude. Crown'd was the forehead with a golden crown, Soft the flusht cheek with slumber's softest bloom Tender, and still, and starry the deep eyes, As spheres of summer midnight, and the lips Sweet with the smiles of satisfying dreams. “Phantasos, I have heard thee, and am here! What wilt thou?” But in silent ecstasy The god, on that crown'd flower-face gazing, felt What never god had felt before, the trance Of adoration. “Wild enchantresses, Whose thaumaturgic revels oft,” he cried, “Thro' Thessaly's witch woods of old I led, Not all the stars your midnight rites enslaved, Nor all your metamorphic philtres brew'd From herbs moon-soak'd on Hecate's altars—no, Nor Circe's sorceries, nor Medea's spells, Have ever such transfiguration wrought! Rejoice, Persephonè, whose favourite here Hath found his kingdom, and his throne assumed! And thou, King Poppy, robed and crown'd at last, Preserve still pure, and still benign dispense, The riches of thy visionary realm! So, when all other kings are kingdomless, Shalt thou still flourish, and to thee the Sons Of Brutus even shall bow down their heads, Hailing thy presence, honouring thy power, Exit Phantasos. And blessing thy beneficence. Farewell!” He hath them now, the purple and the gold, The dominions of King Poppy. Hath all he dream'd of, all his heart's desire! And what the great all-giving gods denied, Two dreaming children gave him. For that gift To children and to dreamers kind is he. But in his kingdom all are dreamers, all Are children; even the busy, even the old. There, where the kingly diadem glows and galls, There, where the hot blood leaps, and beats, and burns, There, in the teeming brain, the burden'd brow, The throbbing veins, the quick unquiet heart, He wields his sceptre, and asserts his power. But have you met him by the wayside bank, Reposing, where the russet wheatfield waves, Among the cornflowers and the vagrant vetch? Or have you seen him where the stubble stands Bristling with spikes the clodded marl, else bare, And the quail couches and the rear-mice flit In the hard furrow, and the lark's nest lurks? Why, earthward bow'd, so heavy hangs his head? His preoccupations. O brave King Poppy, kingly cares hast thou, For kingly cares all kingly power begets! And art thou musing on the multitudes Of weary and yet still impatient souls His subjects. That be thy subjects? Sighest thou to thyself, “How can I ever satisfy them all? Immeasurable are their wants, and yet More even than they want do they desire, And all that they desire, of me they crave!” His powers and his gifts. But thou, King Poppy, thou, and thou alone, For all men canst do all things, and to each Thy gifts are given with an abundant hand. Great rectifier of the wrongs o' the world, Lord of the rock, the spindle, and the shears, Subservient to whose mute command the Three Grey Sisters spin life's faded threads afresh. Or from its tangled skein the knots untie! Prophet of triumph, who for those that fail Dost find unfailing solace in defeat! Brightener and beautifier of dark hours, Who to the fallen and forsaken art Faithful, and to the unloved loving still! Even when the Spectre of To-morrow peers In at the casement, o'er the sleeper stoops, And mutters, “Rouse thee, wretch! arise! go forth! Begin again to suffer and to toil!” Departing with a whisper'd benison, thou Dost leave behind thee one last golden gift. “Take this, poor soul, and keep it! Thine it is,” Thou whisperest. “Show it not, nor speak of it, 'Tis for thee only. It is all that's left Still living of thy last delightful dream, —A lingering memory of it that will last To sweeten the sad time till I return.” O mightiest of monarchs, and most mild, Whose kingdom is the fairest upon earth, The fairest, and the freest! Reign for ever, Fate's master, yet man's ministering friend! Guide of stray'd Love's lone footsteps to the goal That, lost on earth, is in thy realm recover'd! Feaster of famisht hearts, rebuilder bright Of ruin'd fortunes, pain's victorious foe, Grief's comforter, Joy's guardian, good King Poppy! THE END.</field>
