THE MIDSUMMER CUSHION OR COTTAGE POEMS “How can such sweet &amp; lovely hours “Be reckoned but with herbs &amp; flowers” Marvel To the Right Honourable Lord Viscount Milton TO THE RURAL MUSE TO THE RURAL MUSE “Smile on my verse &amp; look the world to love” [A. Hill] Muse of the fields oft have I said farewell To thee my boon companion loved so long &amp; hung thy sweet harp in the bushy dell For abler hands to wake an abler song Much did I fear mine homage did thee wrong Yet loath to leave as oft I turned again &amp; to its wires mine idle hands would cling Torturing it into song—it may be vain Yet still I try ere fancy droops her wing &amp; hopless silence comes to numb its every string Muse of the pasture brooks on thy calm sea Of poesy Ive saild &amp; tho the will To speed were greater than my prowess be Ive ventured with much fear of usuage ill Yet more of joy—tho timid be my skill As not to dare the depths of mightier streams Yet rocks abide in shallow ways &amp; I Have much of fear to mingle with my dreams Yet lovely muse I still believe thee bye &amp; think I see thee smile &amp; so forget I sigh Muse of the cottage hearth oft did I tell My hopes to thee nor feared to plead in vain But felt around my heart thy witching spell That bade me as thy worshiper remain I did &amp; worship on—O once again Smile on my offerings &amp; so keep them green Bedeck my fancies like the clouds of heaven Mingling all hues which thou from heaven dost glean To me a portion of thy power be given If theme so mean as mine may merit aught of heaven For thee in youth I culled the simple flower That on thy bosom gained a sweeter hue &amp; took thy hand along lifes sunny hour Meeting the sweetest joys that ever grew More friends were needless &amp; my foes were few Tho freedom then be deemed as rudeness now &amp; what once won thy praise now meet disdain Yet the last wreath I braided for thy brow Thy smiles did so commend it made me vain To weave another one &amp; hope for praise again With thee the spirit of departed years Wakes that sweet voice that time hath rendered dumb &amp; freshens like to spring—loves hopes &amp; fears That in my bosom found an early home Wooing the heart to extacy—I come To thee when sick of care of joy bereft Seeking the pleasures that are found in bloom &amp; happy hopes that time hath only left Around the haunts where thou didst erst sojourn Then smile sweet cherubim &amp; welcome my return With thee the raptures of lifes early day Appear &amp; all that pleased me when a boy Tho pains &amp; cares have torn the best away &amp; winters crept between us to destroy Do thou commend the reccompence is joy The tempest of the heart shall soon be calm Tho sterner truth against my dreams rebel Hope feels success &amp; all my spirits warm To strike with happier mood my simple shell &amp; seize thy mantles hem O say not fare thee well Still sweet enchantress youths stray feelings move That from thy presence their existance took The innoscent idolatry &amp; love Paying thee worship in each secret nook That fancied friends in tree &amp; flower &amp; brook Shaped clouds to angels &amp; beheld them smile &amp; heard commending tongues in every wind Lifes grosser fancies did these dreams defile Yet not entirely root them from the mind I think I hear them still &amp; often look behind Aye I have heard thee in the summer wind As if commending what I sung to thee Aye I have seen thee on a cloud reclined Kindling my fancies into poesy I saw thee smile &amp; took the praise to me In beautys past all beautys thou wert drest I thought the very clouds around thee knelt I saw the sun to linger in the west Paying thee worship &amp; as eve did melt In dews they seemd thy tears for sorrows I had felt Sweeter than flowers on beautys bosom hung Sweeter than dreams of happiness above Sweeter than themes by lips of beauty sung Are the young fancies of a poets love When round his thoughts thy trancing visions move In floating melody no notes may sound The world is all forgot &amp; past his care While on thine harp thy fingers lightly bound As winning him its melody to share &amp; heaven itself with him where is it then but there Een now my heart leaps out from grief &amp; all The gloom thrown round by cares oershading wing Een now those sunny visions to recall Like to a bird I loose dull earth &amp; sing Lifes tempests swoons to calms on every string &amp; sweet enchantress if I do but dream If earthly visions have been only mine My weakness in thy service wooes esteem &amp; pleads my truth as almost worthy thine Surely true worship makes the meanest theme divine &amp; still warm courage calming many a fear Heartens my hand once more thine harp to try To join the anthem of the minstrel year For summers music in thy praise is high The very winds about thy mantle sigh Love melodies thy minstrel bards to be Insects &amp; birds exerting all their skill Float in continued song for mastery While in thy haunts loud leaps the little rill To kiss thy mantles hem &amp; how can I be still There still I see thee fold thy mantle grey To trace the dewy lawn at morn &amp; night &amp; there I see thee in the sunny day Withdraw thy veil &amp; shine confest in light Burning my fancies with a wild delight To win a portion of thy blushing fame Tho haughty fancies treat thy powers as small &amp; fashions thy simplicitys disclaim Should but a portion of thy mantle fall Oer him who wooes thy love tis reccompence for all Not with the mighty to thy shrine I come In anxious sighs or self applauding mirth On mount parnassus as thine heir to roam I dare not credit that immortal birth But mingling with the lesser ones on earth Like as the little lark from off its nest Beside the mossy hill awakes in glee To seek the mornings throne a merry guest So do I seek thy shrine if that may be To win by new attempts another smile from thee If without thee neath clouds &amp; storms &amp; winds Ive roamed the wood &amp; field &amp; meadow lea &amp; found no flowers but what the vulgar find Nor met one breath of living poesy Among such charms where inspirations be The fault is mine &amp; I must bear the lot Of missing praise to merit thy disdain To feel each idle plea tho urged forgot I can but sigh—tho foolish to complain Oer hopes so fair begun to find them end so vain Then will it prove presumption thus to dare To add fresh failings to each faulty song Urging thy blessing on an idle prayer To sanction silly themes it will be wrong For one so lowly to be heard so long Yet sweet enchantress yet a little while Forgo impatience &amp; from frowns refrain The strong are not debarred thy cheering smile Why should the weak who need them most complain Alone in solitude soliciting in vain But if my efforts on thine harp prove true Which bashful youth at first so feared to try If aught of nature be in sounds I drew From hopes young dreams &amp; doubts uncertainty To these late offerings not without their sigh Then on thine alter shall these themes be laid &amp; past the deeds of graven brass remain Filling a space in time that shall not fade &amp; if it be not so—await disdain Till dust shall feel no sting nor know it toiled in vain PLEASURES OF SPRING How beautiful the spring resumes its reign Breathing her visions oer the earth again The veriest clown that hath a pulse to move Looks on her smiling face &amp; falls in love He plucks the wild flowers scattered from her hand &amp; feels warm rapture round his heart expand Joys of the soul which nature prompts to seek The all of poesy but its power to speak Each bush &amp; tree &amp; sprouting weed is seen Remembering spring &amp; darkening into green The hedgrow thorn unseals its tender shoots &amp; arum leaves sprout green about their roots The ash tree swells its buds as black as jet Whose pale green keys are not unfolded yet The sallow glistens in its gay palm blooms Studded with golden dust where earliest come The solitary wild bees that survive Their trance &amp; keep their feeble songs alive The rifted elm from cloathing spring recieves Its hoplike pale forerunners of the leaves &amp; tasselled catkins on the hazels cling The woodmans genial prophecys of spring There is a calm divinity of joy Breaths rapture round oer every ones employ The Poet feels it neath some forward bush The first in leaf to hide the singing thrush Where cutting open with heart beating speed Some book just purchased which he loves to read Some brother poets new engaging song Which warm anticipation sought so long The Lover feels it in some secret place Shut out from all but one endearing face The idol of his heart that peerless maid Who walks a goddess in the secret shade Whose fairey form replete with every charm Thrills to his heart while hanging on his arm Listing with downward smiles some tender tale Or sudden song of early nightingale Bewitching woman what a boon of bliss Hangs round thy lovliness in spots like this When woman speaks mans heart delighted hears Chaste conversations coupled with meek fears Her innoscence from wrong her heart defends Her smiles would change een savages to friends In earthly charms she rivals heaven above For what were angels without womans love The Hind too feels the happiness of spring Chopping the wattling hedge while linnets sing Around his labour all the live long day &amp; flowers spring up the chronicles of may The Boy too breaths it from the common air While hurrying onward to the distant fair In such glad haste as scarce can give him time In neighbouring bush for peeping nest to climb Or cowslip bunch that meets his eager view About the meadows which he journeys through &amp; Shepherd Boy as soon as eer he finds The brook untroubled with the winter winds Trims up his pole &amp; hunts in april storms The cowdung hillocks on the moor for worms Scarce giving patience leave his hooks to trim Ere in he throws it from the weedy brim Bent oer the leaning willow hour by hour His chair for rest &amp; house to shun a shower The Husbandman to see each freshening sight Feels his heart warm &amp; flutter with delight &amp; cheerful mid the lengthening days turmoils Mingles full many a ballad with his toils Those rude old themes his fathers sung with pride Lost &amp; half buried to the world beside That wed a few fond hearts &amp; linger on Like sweet old poets when their fame is gone Each feels the bliss on toil or leisure fall Bestowed by spring who offers it to all Each flower again smiles th[r]o' its veil of dew Like lovely abscent faces seen anew Rich with the same perfumes &amp; luscious smiles They wake again our leisure to beguile Like an old tale of pleasure told again After long years of desolating pain No fashions change them smell &amp; hue the same With memory old acquaintances proclaim To manhoods withered root of faded joy As when they met us while it bloomed a boy Primroses among thorns now find their home Like timid beautys shunning all that come &amp; lilys of the valley weeping dew Live in their lonliness the season through Save when a lovesick breeze with amourous sigh Lifts their green veils to kiss them passing bye The bark of trees puts gayer liveries on &amp; varied hues thro woodland thickets run The black thorn deepens in a darker stain &amp; brighter freckles hazle shoots regain The woodland rose [in] bright aray is seen Whose bark recieves like leaves a vivid green &amp; foulroyce twigs as red as stockdoves claws Shines in the woods to gain the bards applause While the old oaks rude bulks in vigour warms &amp; mealy powder cloaths his rifted arms In spots like these the shepherd loves to fling His careless limbs neath the young leaves of spring To muse upon some wild brooks hasty streams &amp; idly revel over waking dreams Or stretched in carless mood upon his back To view the blue sky &amp; its sweeping rack Lifting his fancies to each passing cloud &amp; shaping every one that journeys proud Oer its mysterious way to forms &amp; things That fancys visions to his memory brings Some like to rocks gleam on his wondering eye Mid shoreless seas &amp; some go swifter bye Like ships that onward other worlds pursue Oer bounding billows of a different hue Soft as the paper ships he used to make &amp; float in boyhood on each summer lake Some white like pallaces of marble seem The towers of heaven scaled in many a dream &amp; which to waking fancies grandly shine The abodes of one whom instinct owns divine Some like to mountains shadow high &amp; some Like the dear vales that nestle round his home With cots &amp; groves &amp; fountains streaming bye Spreading long edens to the musing eye &amp; thus he dreams away his idle hours Stretched mid the totter grass &amp; nodding flowers &amp; wishing often on his mossy bed For the larks wings that whistles oer his head To realize his glowing dreams &amp; flye To the soft bosom of that sunny sky To trace the seeming vales &amp; mountains there Which hopeless height personifys so fair For in the raptures of his warm delight Mans reason keeps its wisdom out of sight Leaving the sweets of fancy running wild &amp; half remains as he hath been a child By springs warm winds &amp; gleaming smiles awoke The noisey frogs in flaggy marshes croak Of frost bound prisons fled &amp; freedom won &amp; by each bauk that freshens in the sun The snake curls up asleep or crooks along Frighting the schoolboy from his sports &amp; song Who peeps for nests in the half feathered hedge Or picks the pootys from the rustling sedge The prophets of the spring dart down the brook &amp; scarcely gives the shepherd time to look In glad suspence he smiles &amp; guesses on If twas a swallow or his dream of one Untill the bird as to convince the swain Shortens his speed &amp; circles round again Oer fallow fields &amp; moores of russet hue Pewets again their restless flights renew &amp; swoop around with harsh &amp; shrilly cry Oer swains at plough &amp; shepherds wandering bye The schoolboy hears them with a mixed delight Of hopes &amp; pleasures &amp; at morn &amp; night Spends many a leisure hour the meadows guest In fruitless searches for their hidden nest The gay woodpecker with its glossy wing Green as the plumage of returning spring Bores at decaying trees with wakening joys &amp; gives spring welcome with its jarring noise Till startled by the noise of passing clowns Then off it bounces in its ups and downs The Landrail now resumes its haunts again Whom herdboys listen &amp; pursue in vain Its craiking noise how often when a child Ive heard &amp; followed with delusions wild Wading knee deep the downy grass among Startling grasshoppers from their idle song How have I tracked the close &amp; meadow ground Listening &amp; following the deluding sound That onward still its craiking note renewed Nor nearer seemed than when I first pursued Hunt where I would or listen as I might Twas here &amp; there &amp; ever out of sight A very spirit to my wandering thought Heard on but never to be seen or caught So wearied with the chase I turned away &amp; sought new pleasure in my former play Believing it some fairey left by night To wander blinded by the sunny light The partridge mid the wheat that snugly shields His russet plumage gladdens in the fields &amp; home bound hinds at sunsets dewy fall Hears once again its well known evening call Tho these as simple trifles merely seem To those whose souls are dead to every dream That waking spring throws round them—there are some Within whose bosom nature find a home That deem them sweetest themes because they bring The untutored music of returning spring Springs joys are universal &amp; they fall From an unsparing bounty blessing all The meanest thing that lives to crawl or flye Has equal claims in her impartial eye Obscure &amp; mean as they may seem to some She always finds a pathway to their home Een the coy hare blest with her cheering smile Slinks from its buried solitudes awhile From woodland lares all winters wants could find Where brown sedge whistled to the res[t]less wind To clover leas &amp; there it squats to play In timid raptures dewy hours away Till dangers shadows haunt its nimble eye &amp; startling netherd boy goes whooping bye Then off it scampers mid the shielding grain Till all is still &amp; out it skips again &amp; the wild rabbit less reserved &amp; coy Squats on the heaths thyme hills in nibbling joy &amp; crafty fox the blackthorn holts among Plays round its den like kittens with her young March brought a little flower spring loves to wear The brightest jewel in her shining hair That like the daisey wears a lowly head &amp; scarcely peers above its grassy bed &amp; mingling in their blooms they shine afar An earthly sky of gold &amp; silver stars Like them its open look smiles thro the day &amp; shuts at eve like pleasure tired of play In botany it claims an humble shrine &amp; wears the name of “lesser celadine” But by another name the shepherd swain Marks it on young springs dewy paths again With village boys he calls it buttercup Yet not the one with which the faireys sup That holds at night the nectar drops of dew To cheer their mirth the feasting season thro Which proudly leaves the grass to meet the sun &amp; waits till summer hath its reign begun With head less haughty this is taught to shine Of looks bewitching &amp; of hues divine It early comes &amp; glads the shepherds eye Like a bright star spring-tempted from the sky Reflecting on its leaves the suns bright rays That sets its pointed glories in a blaze So bright that childerns fancies it decieves Who think that sunshine settles in its leaves &amp; playful hold it neath each others chins To see it stain with gold their lily skin &amp; he who seems to win the brightest spot Feels future wealth &amp; fortune as his lot Ah happy childhood with that sunny brow No wealth can match what nature gives thee now &amp; like these blossoms of the golden bloom Thy spring must fade tho summers wealth may come From every village groups of merry boys Throng field &amp; meadow seeking after joys &amp; many a littered flower &amp; broken bough Wear the rude marks of their intrusions now &amp; moss &amp; feathers scattered here &amp; there With birds left mourning oer their sad despair Bespeak their young intrusions every day &amp; show the ravage of their tyrant play With eager speed to woodland shades they rush &amp; peep around the pastures stumpy bush Pushing the boughs aside with eager haste &amp; climbing bushes that consceal a nest Tho thorns full oft their little deeds chastise &amp; prick their fingers ere they gain the prize The deepest wound costs but a tear or sigh &amp; new found nests soon warm such sorrows dry Thus on they sport till liberty expires &amp; school again each runaway requires To con his thumb soiled book with many a sigh Oft turning to the door an anxious eye Where sunbeams flicker thro' upon the walls &amp; sparrows chirp with freedoms welcome calls Pictureing restraint more irksome to the mind &amp; heightening pleasures which they left behind Noisey marauders of the plashy green Now spitefull geese with their young broods are seen Nibbling the morning grass bejemmed with dew As yellow as the flowers they wander through Or rippling oer the pond in twittering glee Chasing each waterflye or crossing bee While their protectors watch with wary eye Each fancied enemy that passes bye Hissing &amp; gabbling frightning far away The meddling childern as they pass to play Een dogs will loose their independant pride &amp; drop their tails &amp; fearing turn aside Now walks the man of taste among the woods &amp; fields—&amp; where small runnels rill their floods Loud laughing on their errands watering flowers &amp; down the narrow lanes he walks for hours All carpeted anew with young silk grass So soft that birds hear not the feet that pass Close by their nests—he peeps the leaves among &amp; marks with rapture how they brood their young Then drops beneath the bushes to peruse A pocket poet of some favoured muse Then plucks a primrose from its leafey bed To place between the pages which he read Instead of doubling down to mark the place &amp; lye a relic in times withered space Reminding him as seasons take to wing What joys he felt on such a spot in spring With such sweet essence of earths fading fruits His soul is chronicled above the brutes Such fine ideas that makes life sublime &amp; gains a look in heaven before its time For heaven is happiness &amp; he enjoys That happy dream whoso his mind employs He has his favourite bush &amp; favourite tree &amp; nooks on commons where he loves to be He makes his favourite bank a summer seat &amp; posts &amp; stones he'll leave his path to greet Where time with mossy prophecys presage They are her favoured patriarchs for age The stick he leans on was a favourite shoot That ten years back was severed from the root Of some prized relic or boy favoured tree &amp; keeps it still his daily friend to be With such a waste of happiness he meets As like a bee he strays collecting sweets &amp; gleans right covetous &amp; never tires But thro the dayspring saunters &amp; admires &amp; when the night comes on his fancies wear A wish to lodge with birds &amp; still be there How beautiful the wind awakes &amp; flings Disordered graces oer the face of things Stirring the shorter grass in twittering gleams Like rippling shadows over shallow streams &amp; waving that which grows more rank &amp; high In deepening waves of darker majesty A green &amp; living sea in life arayed Wave rolling over wave shade chasing shade In every different grade of stirring hue More swifter then the swallow can pursue Who journeys low &amp; rapid oer the lea &amp; seemly swims along the summer sea The brushing billows rush oer passing feet As waves are broken oer the rocks they meet The woods too round the landscape roll a sea Of varied hues &amp; wild imensity Heaving fantastic on the wandering eye Hugh swelling billows to the smiling sky Here oft the poet wanders &amp; employs His leisure midst this wilderness of joys Seeking the spots his heart the most approves &amp; wild grown pastures which he dearly loves The common furze clad heath all wild where sheep Paddle their thousand tracks &amp; rabbits leap Playfully battering every little hill Thrown up by moles that burrow at their will Where tracks of waggons map the vagrant sward That claims no fence or ownerships regard Yet nature cloaths it oer with tastefull care In garments which the may is proud to wear Furze never out of blossom &amp; the broom That rivals sunshine with their golden bloom Where mossy brooks their shallow floods distill Forceing their way &amp; wandering at their will Here thoughts run wild by starts in various moods Now eddying as the runnel thro the woods Dallying with pleasant things as it with leaves Then starts &amp; wider space its glow recieves Like cataracts led with hurried eager ire As almost kindles water into fire His thoughts rush out with joys unfelt before &amp; maddening raptures make his soul run oer With its divine consceptions till they rise Forgetting earth &amp; mix with paradise Now long &amp; green grows every laughing day Till clouds seem weary with their length of way &amp; when the evening in her leisure comes Night threats no terrors in its winter glooms That prompted dismal tales round sooty hearth &amp; midnight murders left small room for mirth Revealed by many a horrid screaming ghost As heard by travellers upon wild heaths lost Or seen in ancient rooms by folks abed To draw the curtains with quick hand tho dead &amp; walk the stair case with unearthly tread Makeing each listners very flesh to creep &amp; men &amp; childern even dread to sleep Night throws the mantle bye she wildly wore &amp; winter like a wizard reigns no more Borrowing the voices of the bursting wind To howl its dreads on the benighted hind Who heard in tempests ringing oer his head Ten thousand yells to stop him as he fled These all have fled their sabbath glooms to keep Till desolate winter startles them from sleep In spellbound caves &amp; charnel vaults they hide Where bats are bred &amp; dreadful dreams abide Eve cometh now with her attendant moon As pleasant as a cloudy day in June &amp; daylight ever stays the whole night long To list the nightingales unsleeping song &amp; night grim tyrant in fears dread parade Is now a bankrupt broken in his trade The winds play harmless in the fledging bowers Soft as the motion of the shaken flowers Disturbing not the young moths easy flight That steals to kiss the sleeping flowers at night The clouds in beautious order thro the sky Veil &amp; not hide the moonlight passing bye Mantled in beautious forms that seem to be The travelling spirits of eternity The husbandman released from toiling day Muses in pleasure on his homeward way Oft gazing on the pale moons peaceful face &amp; pictures there a quiet resting place Deeming it heaven or somthing near akin To what all wishes are so warm to win When dark hereafter takes him as her guest He deems that place a sabbath land of rest Thinking his soul shall gather wing &amp; flye To that pale eden on the soft blue sky The lingering milkmaid now tho far from town Loiters along &amp; sets her buckets down Nor starts at sounds that meet her listening ear For happy hope takes place of every fear &amp; paints her love in every object round &amp; fancy hears his voice in every sound The boy neer mends his pace but soodles on Blessing the moonlight when the day is gone &amp; even dares to pause amid the shade Of the old ruined castle undismayed To mark the change—that some few weeks ago Hid its blank walls in draperys of snow Marking in joy on its once naked tower Snub elders greening &amp; full many a flower Of Bloodwalls glowing with rich tawney streaks Blushing in beauty from the gaping creeks Swathy yet lovely by each zepher fanned As the soft cheek of maidens summer tanned Wreaths nature loves round ruins brows to bind From seeds took thither by the birds &amp; wind He views those garlands &amp; seems struck the while That things so abject should be seen to smile Oft turning to the moon a wondering eye That seems to journey with him thro' the sky Moves as he moves &amp; stops as glad the while To wait his leisure while he climbs a stile He walks it walks &amp; keeps his every pace Runs when he runs &amp; glories in the race He trys his utmost speed to leave behind His shining friend &amp; thinks he beats the wind For swiftness as he pants &amp; hurries on Inly exulting that the race is won But spite of every vale &amp; weary hill He passed &amp; clomb so swift it followed still &amp; while he hums oer each old tune he loves Do as he will it moveth as he moves Swift as his thoughts his speed is all in vain He turns to look &amp; there it is again Plump opposite him gleaming pale &amp; wan As near as when his eager race began He thinks on the long ways he left behind &amp; vain wild notions fill his puzzled mind The gossip tales that winter did supply Urge their faint shadows on his gazing eye &amp; the pale shades that cloud the moon so wan His artless fancys fashions to a man Oft has he heard at night when toil was done Rude tales of jiants dwelling in the moon &amp; this as one of those his mind supplies That takes his nightly journeys thro the skies So here he stops nor urges speed again Deeming a race with jiants doubly vain Now many an eve in simple moods of praise The Hind right thankful for the lengthening days Will oer his Bible in rich musings lean Thats wrapt in baize to keep the covers clean Noteing with joy as on he reads to see The truth &amp; power of sacred poesy Those texts of spring he gets by heart to tell His fellows which describe the time so well As “now the time of singing birds is come” &amp; “lilys among thorns do make their home” “The winters past the rain is oer &amp; gone” These are the texts that lead his raptures on “The vine shoots forth &amp; yields a goodly smell” He finds no book that tells the time so well &amp; ere he goes to bed in humble ways He breaths a prayer &amp; fervently he prays For blessings on his family around That in the sooty corner sit profound Begging alike to bear the worst when sent All breathe amen &amp; go to bed content Prayers are the wings by which the soul doth flye To gather blessings from the bountious sky &amp; they are blest whose days thus calmly wear Each met in hope &amp; finished in a prayer TALES VALENTINE EVE Young girls grow eager as the day retires &amp; smile &amp; whisper round their cottage fires Listning for noises in the dusky street For tinkling latches &amp; for passing feet The prophecys of coming joys to hark Of wandering lovers stealing thro' the dark Dropping their valentines at beautys door With hearts &amp; darts &amp; love knots littered oer “Aye” said a gossip by a neighbours hearth While the young girls popt up in tittering mirth To hear the door creek with heart jumping signs &amp; footsteps hastening bye &amp; valentines Drop rustling on the floor—“aye aye” she said (As they kept back &amp; smiled oer what they read) Your fine love letters might be worth your smiles If 'stead of coming from some creeping giles Rich lovers sent them as it once befell To one young maiden I remember well Tho Madam Meers now lives at oakley hall With coach &amp; four &amp; footmen at her call Her father was none else than farmer Ling &amp; she plain Kate before she wore a ring Tho I began about the valentine The starting subject I'll awhile resign But hear with patience &amp; ye'll quickly learn For I'll haste on &amp; take it up in turn When the poor irish from their country rove &amp; like scotch cattle throng the road in droves To seek the profits which the harvest brings At that same season to old farmer Lings A stranger came but not of foreign blood He spoke plain english &amp; his looks was good &amp; hired himself for toil the season thro At any jobs the harvest had to do &amp; tho he seemed as merry as the clowns He neer was noisey like such vulgar lowns &amp; when he heard them urge a vulgar joke At passing maids he neither laughd nor spoke But while he saw the blush their rudeness made His manners seemed their freedom to upbraid For he'd turn round a moment from his toil &amp; say “good morning” &amp; would kindly smile Tho dressed like them in jacket russet brown His ways betrayed him better than a clown &amp; many a guess from rumours whispers fell &amp; gossips daily had new tales to tell Some said he once had been a wealthy man &amp; from a bankrupts painful ruin ran Others with far worse causes marked his flight &amp; taxed him with a forgers name out right &amp; tho he heard such whispers passing bye He'd laugh but never stop to question why Nor seemed offended think whatere he would But always seemed to be in merry mood Bad as folks thought him I was well aware That he by one at least was welcome there Who always mid their noisey idle prate Would silent stand &amp; that was rosey Kate She seemed bewitched with his good mannered ways &amp; never spoke about him but to praise She was the youngest daughter fair &amp; gay As flowers that open in the dews of May Loves heart neer trembled at a sweeter face When health &amp; beauty courted its embrace Nor lived a merrier girl beneath the sun For romp &amp; play when labours work was done Wild as a Doe that overleapt the park She'd laugh &amp; play oer evenings games till dark All noise &amp; stir like an ill sitting hen But shoy &amp; timid in the sight of men Her friends neer dreamed of what all else might see His ways was plain as the “cross row” to me When ere he caught her in her dissabille Washing or aught—she ran as lovers will Up stairs as quickly as she could from sight To seek her glass &amp; put her garments right Anxious to meet him in her best attire As he the more might love her &amp; admire &amp; once at eve as we the cows did wait He leaned beside her on the stackyard gate &amp; smiled &amp; whispered as she stooped adown To pull some burdocks from her sweeping gown “Mary theres one whose thoughts when your away “Always cling with you full as close as they “Who hopes yet fears his growing love to name “Lest you should throw it from you just the same” She coloured like the fire &amp; turned aside But I saw quickly what her heart would hide &amp; up &amp; told her when she milked at night That be the harvest stranger who he might A winning tongue neaths toils disguise was hid That knew more manners then our farmers did She laughd &amp; said “aye so you love him then But as for her shed no regard for men” Tho such denials kept the secret worse I took no heed but sanctioned her discourse &amp; when she dressed to walk on harvest eves Spending an hour to glean among the sheaves Things were to others eyes full often seen That she'd more errands than the one to glean She always follow'd in the strangers toil Who oft would stop to wet his hook &amp; smile &amp; loose when none percieved from out his hand Some wheat ears now &amp; then upon the land &amp; oft when running from a sudden shower Or leaving off to take their beavering hour He always from the rest would linger last To leave a smile &amp; greet her as he past All that had any sense to use their eyes Might easy guess beneath the thin disguise Like to the burr about the moon at night It seems to covert but still leaves it light &amp; sure enough he was a handsome swain One any maiden had been proud to gain Een I have often envied Kittys place &amp; felt the heartache at his smiling face For when I passed him he would always smile &amp; often took my milk pail oer a stile Jeering us both of sweethearts in our play Tho nothing but in good behaviours way He said to me—yet without shame I say't I thought myself as fine a wench as Kate Dark as the strangers mystery were his ways Here wandered round the field on sabbath days &amp; left to vulgar minds the noisey town Nor made a partner of a fellow clown Traceing the wood tracks overgrown with moss Or with heath rabbits winding thro the goss &amp; oft neath black thorn shadows by the brook Was seen by shepherds musing oer a book &amp; in his button holes was always seen Wildflowers—that in his rambles he would glean Folks often marvelled at each seeming whim What we thought weeds seemd best of flowers with him The ragged robbin by the runnel brinks Seemed in his eye much finer flowers then pinks &amp; tall wild woad that lifts its spirey tops By stone pits—nay een briony &amp; hops He would from hedges in a poesy bind &amp; leave the woodbine &amp; the rose behind All wondered at his ways &amp; some believed The man was crazed but rumour gets decieved When busy harvest to its end had come &amp; childern ran to hollow “harvest home” Bawling half hidden neath each green ash bough For cross plumb skittles out of fashion now Kate was the queen upon that merry night &amp; rode upon the waggon drest in white The stranger oft looked up to see her stand &amp; smiling called her “queen of fairey land” That harvest supper we had morts of fun &amp; Farmer Sparks was there a neighbours son He was her fathers choice who dreamed of gain &amp; talked of marriage as he would of grain He vainly tryed young Kittys smiles to share &amp; next her without bidding took his chair Full oft with gracious simperings looking up To drink to Kitty oer the silver cup While she but with a careless look replied Or turned like one that would not heed aside But if the stranger gazed above his horn She smiled as lovely as a mayday morn Soon as the racket &amp; the fun began Young Farmer Sparks up from the table ran To act the crane &amp; poked the room about Breaking the pipes &amp; putting candles out While wenches squealed &amp; old dames fainted pale Quickly recovering with an horn of ale The stranger seemed to shun the rude uproar &amp; Kate slove with him to the kitchen door I sat on thorns the live long night about For fear their ways would blab the secret out &amp; had aught met the fathers jealous sight Farewell to fun &amp; frolic for the night But all went right &amp; naught was seen or done To spoil the acting or to damp the fun The old man smoked his pipe &amp; drank his ale &amp; laughed most hearty at each sport &amp; tale On the next day for Kate a gloomy day The harvest labourers took their parting pay &amp; the young stranger with a downcast eye Turned round to Kate &amp; bade us both “good bye” Soon as he went she ran with eager feet Up stairs to see him vanish down the street I heard the creeking casement open thrown &amp; knew full well what she neer cared to own For her swelled eyes their secrets badly kept When she came down they told me she had wept Twas harmless sorrows did her bosom move &amp; theres no sin nor shame to weep for love Sometimes she seemed as sad &amp; sometimes gay But never more appeared so fond of play Lone pastimes now did leisure hours engage Dull as a tamed bird wonted to the cage She seemed to be while time unheeding went Nor left a hope to ease her discontent At length the postman with his wind pluft cheek That brought the news &amp; letters once a week Some mornings after valentine was bye Came in &amp; gan his parcel to untie Her sisters bustled up &amp; smiling thought That he some lovers valentines had brought But hopes with them was quickly out of date Soon as they found the letter was for Kate Poor wench her colour came &amp; went away Now red as crimson then as pale as may The old man thought it farmer Sparkes's son That sent the thing &amp; felt his wishes won Laying his pipe down he began to joke &amp; clapt her on the shoulder as he spoke Have at him wench thats all I have to tell &amp; bonny Kate will sell her beauty well For he's got money wench as well as love To make your ring sit easy as a glove But when he found the postmark &amp; the seal Did different notions to his own reveal He let the mystery undisturbed remain &amp; turned his chair &amp; took his pipe again Her sisters bit their lips in silent spite &amp; could not keep their envye out of sight To think that bonny Kate above them all Who never in her life had seen a ball Nor spent an hour to curl her parted hair Nor of her beauty seemed to have one care That romped about in play &amp; joined in toil While they would sit &amp; not a finger soil Should be thus noticed—but they urged a doubt &amp; muttered some low bred ingenious lout Had sent the thing &amp; said with louder voice “Be who he will he wears a vulgar choice” &amp; tho they might clowns valentines condemn Een they were welcome when they came to them For Sawney Sparks &amp; each young farmer guest Was little better then a clown at best Be who he might it made their bosoms ache &amp; worse when time unriddled their mistake Kate had no pride about her she was free As any maiden in the world could be &amp; while her sisters dressed in muslin gowns &amp; scorned on holidays to talk with clowns She seemed to wear no better dress then I Yet won a look from every passer bye &amp; some that passed would mutter praises loud “Theres a sweet face” which never made her proud She made all equals—used een beggars well &amp; all of Kate had some kind things to tell When summer eves the first come swallows meet As Kate &amp; I were looking down the street These little summer visitors to view Marking how lowley &amp; how swift they flew We heard the bustle of a coach &amp; four Race the lane dust &amp; hurry towards the door The yard dog never barked nor made a fuss But dropt his tail &amp; stopt to gaze with us Een the old geese were silent at the sight &amp; in amazement half forgot their spite The noisey childern in the street at play Picked up their tops &amp; taws &amp; sneaked away &amp; Kate half startled sneaked &amp; hurried in While wonder heaved her bosom to her chin &amp; well it might for twas the very same Man that at harvest as a reaper came The same that sent her at the valentine The clever letter that was wrote so fine Old women that had muttered round the town &amp; called the stranger by worse names than clown Peeped out &amp; dropped their courtseys to the coach &amp; mixed in groups to question its approach Fine as he was soon as he came in view I knew his face &amp; so did Kitty too Who overcame turned white as was the wall &amp; almost fainted but he stopt the fall &amp; kept her in his arms with fondling pain Till the fresh rose came to her face again Her father gaped &amp; wondered at the throng &amp; bowed &amp; chattered wether right or wrong Guessing that love was what the stranger meant The coach was plenty to buy his consent &amp; thinking Kate had made her fortune now He bustled up &amp; gan to scrape &amp; bow &amp; bade Kate welcome in her noble guest With wine &amp; ale the oldest &amp; the best But he was not to be by flattery fed He only smiled &amp; never turned his head I want no formal welcomes keep your place Old man he said—but why that blushing face My bonny Kate I left thee fond &amp; true &amp; wish to find thee as I used to do Smiling &amp; free as on each harvest morn When I as labourer reaped thy fathers corn I travelled in disguise alone to find The native undisguise of womans mind They're easy coyed to take a golden bait &amp; love in mockery—but my bonny Kate I found in thee a heart I wished to prove Who ignorant of wealth was caught by love Then shrink not if thy heart is still sincere Nor blush nor startle with confounding fear To see thy mother at this finery awed &amp; father bow &amp; christen me “my lord” No honours &amp; no titled names are mine But all I have plain love &amp; wealth is thine Tho I have grown above thy fathers toil In reaping corn &amp; ploughing up the soil Yet that fond love my Kitty showed to me Was neer a moment from my memory Thy beauty would bewitch a world with love &amp; Ive returned thy worth &amp; vows to prove Ive came as promised for thee many a mile Then bid me welcome with thy usual smile Reach not sweet Kate the silver cup for me But bring the horn toil often drank to thee &amp; thus he said but how can words of mine Relate a speech that he told oer so fine However there they sat the night about &amp; drank the old brown pitcher nearly out Kate often smiled but yet was still &amp; shoy &amp; the old man got down right drunk for joy Who often reached across his elbow chair To gain the whisper of his daughters ear Muttering when ere the stranger turned his head His urgent wishes in her looks to wed Fingers in vain were shook to keep him still He een got wilder in his headstrong will “—A good receipt neer makes a bargain wrong “So Kate says he burn nothing with your tongue” &amp; drank her health anew—the strangers eye Looked smiling at him but made no reply When morning came Kate gave her hearts consent The coach was ordered &amp; to church they went Before the sun the old man bustled up &amp; gave his blessing oer the silver cup At the glad closing of that happy day The stranger drove his blooming bride away She left her presents for the cake &amp; tea Leaving old gossips in the highest glee While he with gifts the ringers did regale Who rung his praises both with bells &amp; ale &amp; tho she promised me a handsome gown When eer she married be he gent or clown No wonder that her memorys were away I quite excused her breaking it that day He was no lord tho he was full as great A country squire with a vast estate In the most trifling things she had her ends &amp; ere she'd gone a twelvemonth from her friends She wished once more to see us all again &amp; as indulgence to her lonely pain They in their coach &amp; four came shining down To rent a dwelling near her native town &amp; Oakley hall that tops old cromwells hill He took to please &amp; occupys it still A fine old place with ivy round the porch That long had stood as empty as a church Folks say it is a Cromwells castle been &amp; in the walls still cannon holes are seen There they in happiness &amp; luxury live &amp; share the all lifes pleasure has to give Sometimes they visit at their own estate &amp; yearly drive to London with the great Whenever I have errands from the town To seek the hall she gives me many a crown Making me welcome in plain friendly ways &amp; often laughs about our younger days “Hark thats the clock well I must up &amp; roam My man no doubt sits waiting me at home Wholl scold &amp; say by sitting here till nine That Im an old fool keeping Valentine So good night all” &amp; hastening from her seat She sought her clogs &amp; clocked adown the street The girls were glad twas done—&amp; in her place The happy cat leapt up &amp; cleaned her face While crickets that had been unheard so long Seemed as she stopt to start a merrier song GOING TO THE FAIR Gay rose the morn fulfilling many a prayer Of anxious maids—the day was Topal Fair The month was may the meadows they were green &amp; full of flowers tho paths were far from clean Moistened by showers that frequent tho not long Fell &amp; were done ere linnets could their song That now by crowds in every thicket sung &amp; from the mill dam up the Heron sprung In every field larks twittered oer the grain As happy twas the fair so thought the swain Who hastened oer his labour to get free By times the pleasures of the fair to see The very air breathed joy &amp; all the May To such appeared in joyouance with the day As if the fair had put their pleasures on Thus merry minds shape raptures from their own In ivy bowers woodpiegons sat to coo &amp; smooth voiced cuckoos muttered as they flew Free smiled the daisey from dull nights embrace Flushed with his dewy kisses on its face The sun was peeping oer the spreading rows Of dark green elms alive with busy crows &amp; round the Lodge that darkened neath their shade Loud was the strife that pigs &amp; poultry made A farmhouse now tho once a moated hall As loud too farmer Thriftys morning call “Come up boys up” re-echoed thro the Lodge Where last to bed &amp; first to rise was Hodge Who heard the unwelcome shout mid yawns &amp; sighs &amp; spent some minutes to unclose his eyes Yet up he must to fetch his horses now They needed corn &amp; waiting lay the plough &amp; morning toil must needs be finished soon As all had leave to join the fair at noon So up Hodge got &amp; soodled down the lane Hirpling like one whose joints was stiff with pain Tho urged by many a call till out of sight To mend his pace &amp; not be out till night &amp; Simon foremost of the servant clan Who next the master ruled as master man Was more than anxious to perform his part Who stript already stopt his song to start As love &amp; hope with mingling fear &amp; glee Burnt every thought with madness to be free Mary a maid whose fame was in her face Who lived his partner in his last years place &amp; now tho distant from him many a mile Her former fondness cheered his present toil For she had vowed last martinmass when they For their new places parted wide away That come what would—on the returning Fair She'd come to see her friends &amp; meet him there So Simons hopes who painted her as come Burnt till they grew all rebels to their home Forcing his heart on fancys wings to wend In thought already at its journeys end His mind all night on thoughts with dull delay Its parting waited wide awake for day &amp; now the day had come he waited on To end his mornings labour &amp; begone While mingling hopes unsatisfied desires With their warm gushes &amp; blood boiling fires Scarce gave him time—so anxious to pursue Even to think of what he had to do By kindness he had bought in seasons past The love of Mary which he hoped would last Who young &amp; blushing was &amp; sweet to see Yet not like gaudy roses on the tree For beauty blazed not in her face yet there A twilight splendour owned her more then fair Illumned by many a mellancholly smile That taste while gazing might believe the while The pastoral muse did in her beauty shine Such as might warm far better songs than mine The voice of woods &amp; streams was in her looks &amp; wise she seemed tho ignorant of books Her hair was swarthy brown &amp; soft of hue As the sweet gloom that falls with evens dew That on her fine white forhead did divide In the triumphant negligence of pride Her eyes were dark but they wore lights to shine That love adores &amp; poets call divine &amp; her cheeks summer blooms wore hues the while Of loves soft innoscence without its guile &amp; on the pouting of her amorous lip Where love delicious nectar longed to sip Beauty sat throned in that bewitching spell That love adores &amp; language cannot tell Where charms triumphant made each gazer pay Heartaches for looking ere he turned away &amp; so did Simons but the smiles that cured Paid more then double for the pain endured For in loves views to win her kind regard He milked—&amp; every sunday swept the yard That she might on her errands safely go Nor soil the gloss jet of her sunday shoe &amp; from the stack a faggot every night He threw his Marys morning fire to light Nay did all toils her sundays had to do When she had on a garment that was new &amp; feared with thorns to tear or dirt to soil While love was all the payment for his toil By all these deeds he strove his love to show Nor was she backward what they meant to know &amp; tho she shrieked to shun a stolen kiss A chance to meet his smile she'd never miss &amp; oft for syllabubs for cream she crept When mistress gossiped &amp; the master slept &amp; slove the cellar key from off the nail Above her masters chair to steal him ale While in those favoured hours most like to speed Simon had sued &amp; Mary had agreed Live where they might or fair or foul the weather Theyd meet this morning at the fair together Altho six lingering months since then had now Spread in between warm love to cool that vow Altho six lingering miles with dreary view Stretched loves frail chain—still he believed her true At length came Hodge with trouble in his speed For when with quicker pace he did proceed Bad news was sure the herald of his tale To say a portion of his job did fail &amp; now he stopt his song ere nigh to bawl Of gaps new broke &amp; horses vanished all For he seemed joyed to find them all astray Wishing no doubt theyd neer be found that day A truce from plough to rest each weary limb Was more then fairs or holidays to him Simon in silence like a statue stood Dire dissapointment curdled up his blood His hopes &amp; holiday all seemed as done While farmer Thrifty bade them search till noon Sending out heralds famed for swifter speed Than Hodge grown needless in the time of need When soon the horses all were found but one &amp; Dobbin oftenest to transgress was gone Dobbin a horse well known for miles around In every village &amp; in every pound Altho so tame at toil that boys might guide &amp; childern walk uninjured by his side When loose from geers he roved as freedoms mate Hed find all gaps &amp; open every gate &amp; if aught sweet beyond his pasture grew No fence so thick but he would blunder thro' His youth from gipseys did these tricks recieve With them he toiled &amp; worked his wits to live Bare roads he traced all day with nought to bite Then stole with them to stacks to feed at night Tho now a better life was Dobbins lot Well fed &amp; fat youths tricks he neer forgot Still gaps were broke &amp; Dobbin bore the blame Still stacks were pulled &amp; Dobbin felt no shame If fifty partners in his pasture lay Dobbin was safe to lead them all astray &amp; yet a better horse all did alow Was never yoked to waggon or to plough Old farmer thrifty now with vengance ripe Cursed &amp; laid down half smoaked his morning pipe Vowing old Dobbins tricks would loose his crop Of corn if thus whole days they forced to stop The harrow—&amp; then threw his hands behind him “If hes above ground curse him we will find him” &amp; Simon as the safest to succeed Was posted off &amp; tho to urge his speed A flaggon of the best ere he did start Was drawn that burnt like brandy round his heart But nothing cheered it for his hopes was crost &amp; chance of meeting Mary seemed as lost Yet he brushed onward on his doubtful rout With best leg foremost to find Dobbin out Muttering his threats in angers blustering tones How he would thrash the wanderers lazy bones Whittling a monstrous cudgel while he spoke Proving therebye he did not mean to joke Alas for Dobbin sore will be his back If Simon finds him &amp; he marks his track For faithless dews his blundering steps betrayed Oer close &amp; field in crooked marks displayed But the kind sun that smiles on all below Was Dobbins friend tho Simon was his foe Drying the tell tale dew from off the grass Leaving the ploughman to proceed by guess Who asked of almost every one he met Searched in each pound &amp; neer the wiser yet Measuring his shadow every now &amp; then To guess the hour then hurried on agen While Marys smiles &amp; promise &amp; the fair Rose oer all hopes &amp; drove them to despair Search where he might enquire of whom he would Dobbin was missing as if lost for good For he was reckoned cunning &amp; at least Had more of reason then a common beast Seeking such secret spots from summer skys As if he hid from toil as well as flies This Simon knew &amp; searched in every spot Where he might hide but yet had hidden not So on he searched &amp; cursed &amp; searched again Muttering the while his threatning oaths in vain Laying to Dobbins tramp in reckless strife The loss of love &amp; happiness for life While short his shadow grew &amp; shifted on Untill it tokened half the day was gone &amp; what was worse the hour when at the gate Mary for Simons coming was to wait When he had told her last &amp; vowed as how That spot should sink ere he would break his vow That vow was broke—at least the time expired When Mary was to wait as love desired &amp; wait she did for half the morning there Where two paths met the high road to the fair She left her fathers cot before the time To make her lover wait appeared a crime “Decietful man” doubt burnt hopes taper dim She sighed &amp; muttered “I may wait for him” “Here I may stand in doubt the morning long “Altho he knows he never thinks it wrong “Last night I came six weary miles in vain “Cheered with the thoughts of seeing him again “My mothers love could ill my absence spare “But without Simon I was restless there” So sighed the maid as oer the stile she bent &amp; sighed &amp; onward to the fair she went While every noise that floated in the wind Would make her pause &amp; turn a look behind For Simons haloo she would list &amp; look Loitering &amp; musing to be overtook Altho still cheated—down each narrow lane At every turn she'd stop &amp; wait again Till tired with hopes excuses for delay The rosebud in her bosom dyed away Which there was placed new graces to reveal Or more for Simons tempted hands to steal But Simon came not &amp; the withered rose Was the first omen sorrows to disclose Stung with the void of abscence to the fair Hopes curdled all to malice—&amp; when there To loose her thoughts she struggled to be gay Passing in freakish whims the merry day Mocking gay feelings that had small akin To the perplexitys that lurked within Changing her nature &amp; in freedoms ways Smiled as if courting amorous eyes to gaze Taking with willing hand in merry cue The glass to kiss from every youth she knew Each proffered fairing too was freely taen She cracked the nutts &amp; threw the shells again Resolved to change her old love for a new &amp; leave off Simon deemed no longer true Yet half unconsious of the looks she raised She blushed &amp; seemed to wonder why they praised While Footman Tim in his gilt gaudy suit Tapping with pride his cane upon his boot Grown bold with ale nipt up in smirking glee &amp; rudely made her welcome to his knee Soon from his silken purse his cash was flung &amp; crown by crown upon the table rung For every groat &amp; een a penny paid This purse &amp; all this silver was displayed The while he sat he'd chink his cash about To let folk know his pockets wa'n't without Tween thumb &amp; finger oft he swung his cane In haughty grace then sipt his glass again Still leaving dregs at bottom to throw down To show how fashion acted from a clown &amp; more in Marys presence to display A careless waste as heeding not the pay Full oft unbidden out his watch was taen To show the hour but more to show the chain &amp; off his gloves were pulled his nails to bite With vain excuse to show his hands were white While open flew his waistcoat at the chin Crimpt frills displaying &amp; a golden pin To raise his consequence in vulgar eyes &amp; win the girls to think a blank a prize Mary seemed hurt yet suffered to be held Bearing the seat with patience while compelled &amp; Simon now with weary feet &amp; mind Pursuing Dobbin whom he could not find Gave up the hunt his master heard the tale &amp; swore yet paid him with a horn of ale Saying as morn was bye he well could spare Them all—so all made ready for the fair His Ash plant Simon in his hand had got Yet paused in doubt half willing &amp; half not Beside the door with kerchief smoothening down The ruffled nap upon his beavers crown Then starting off then still foreboding doubt Dark fears strong impulse made him pause about Sweet was the day &amp; sunny gleamed the weather While sheep loud bleating called their lambs together “Craik” went the Landrail in the wind waved grain Whom idle schoolboys hearing chased in vain In Simons mind the noise bespoke his fate He thought it muttered he was all too “late” “Chewsit” the Pewit screamed in swopping wews “Chuse it” said Simon I know whom to chuse Thus neer a bird could sing but Simons cares Shaped it to somthing of his own affairs &amp; while he whiped the moisture from his brow Fear chilled his spirit with his broken vow &amp; soon must love like lifes deciet decide How nearly joys &amp; sorrows are allied The day was swiftly wasting with the wear &amp; some few girls were coming from the fair Who left gay mirth &amp; all his noisey crew Not without sighs their evening jobs to do &amp; he when met got many a laughing look Full loud their fears were urged to cross the brook Knocking their pattens when no dirt was near &amp; finding danger where no danger were Signals to urge the aid of Simons hand But such he could or would not understand He hurried by them all &amp; would not stay To ask a question or salute the day Tho screams &amp; shouts alternate rung behind Raising their wanton ecchoes on the wind He never once turned oer his arm to see If they got oer or in the brook not he His thoughts already at their journeys end Left him no time on trifles to attend With patten rings the path was thickly cut Where fancy painted Marys nimble foot In many a printing mark as on before Which burnt his thoughts &amp; hastened him the more At length the noisey fair assailed his ear Great grew his hope but greater grew his fear &amp; as he crushed among the crowds when there His eyes dare scarcely wander oer the fair Lest he—for fear was busy to alarm Should see his Mary on anothers arm &amp; as his spirits worn in feeble guise Needed the boldness barley stout supplies He sought the ale house where by fear repelled He scarce dare credit what his eyes beheld When in a corner full of outward glee He saw his Mary on anothers knee He turned away nor would his looks repeat She turned as white as death but kept her seat For well she thought his carelessness foretold He for a new love had forsook the old While he with far more cause for dark distrust Thought all was over &amp; his actions just &amp; tho he could not stifle without pain His love he thought it useless to explain So sat in silence as if none the while Was worth the notice of a word or smile Yet as poor captives oft in hopeless plight Look thro their bars on liberty &amp; light So did his eyes beneath his beavers brim Steal looks on Mary half unknown to him While lifting up when not athirst the quart To drown the sigh fast swelling from his heart &amp; Mary smiling struggled to be gay Tho dissapointment turned her cheek to clay &amp; eat like cankers every rose away The deepest sorrow hath no tongue but steals Signs from the heart betraying what it feels Sighs come at deeper eloquence than speech &amp; tears touch chords that language cannot reach —While footman Tim was busy with his tale &amp; toasting Mary oer each draught of ale Simon as able to behold no more Emptied his quart &amp; hurried to the door To seek amusement in the noise &amp; rout Within the fair &amp; keep old memorys out But all were blanks &amp; every wish was vain &amp; search for peace still added more to pain The showmans shouts which wonder yearly brings The huge hung pictures of outlandish things Where grinning tigers wavered in the wind Raising more wonders than they hid behind The merry fool that would his speeches make Till at the sport old womens sides would ache These without pleasure now he sauntered bye &amp; only turned a careless ear or eye &amp; weary with the frolic &amp; the fun He sauntered homeward ere the fair was done While as in melancholly mood he went In mutterings loud he gave his sorrows vent ‘Is it for this’ he said &amp; turned behind As if mistrustful of the listening wind ‘Is it for this I watched till church was oer Her hens &amp; scoldings from the parson bore Hunting the eggs all churchtime thro the day That none should scold her cause they laid away Is it for this my credit all at stake &amp; even life I ventured for her sake When in the orchard while she milked her cows I stole &amp; clambered to the topmost boughs To reach the reddest apple plumb or pear For no more payment than a smile could spare Smiles feed young love to madness &amp; beguiles So Ive rued sorely since I lived on smiles In this same close which brings up happier hours On sundays when we brushed these selfsame flowers When glossy slippers did her feet bedeck I took my kerchief even from my neck To whipe off lingering drops of bygone showers Or maybe tears from crushed &amp; broken flowers &amp; dust that would their glossy hues oercast Powdered from kingcups shaken as we past But whats the use to bring up things gone bye My best I did &amp; the worst served am I’ Here Simon stopt for loud upon his ear Stole merry voices fast approaching near From many laughing home returning groups Not sad like Simon under broken hopes But wild with joy glad frolicked many a lass On ploughmans arms light skipping thro the grass Old men &amp; women too with ale inspired Felt young again &amp; laughed till they were tired While childern stooped &amp; shouted by their sides To see their shadows take such antique strides As mocking the old dames who danced &amp; sung With aprons spread as nimble as the young Simon right anxious for the nights disguise Hurried along to hide from meddling eyes While low the sun in evenings mellow light Behind the meadow bridges sunk from sight Yet as if loath to leave the merry crew Peeped thro the arches in a last adieu Simon tho filled with thoughts reflecting pain Could not but turn to see it peep again Remembering at the sight in happier days How Mary stood that self same thing to praise What sorrowful delights such dreams bequeath What golden feelings clad in memorys wreath Past reccolections in our bosoms move That once were hopes attendants upon love &amp; Simon een in sorrow felt a joy From memorys past that nothing could destroy But such are reveries that will not last They come like thoughts &amp; ere we muse are past Hopes change like summer clouds from shape to shape Setting the restless fancies all agape &amp; painting joys as beautiful &amp; fair Till all disolves into the common air So Simon proved it as he onward sped Who soon as home went supperless to bed &amp; tho at toil next day he bawled &amp; sung Twas but to smother how his heart was wrung His mind still laboured over past affairs &amp; strove in vain to get the start of cares While hope proposed a medicine for pain Making it up to see her once again Resolving if next sunday should be fine To look oer all &amp; ere he would resign Loves all hed go &amp; clear himself from wrong &amp; tell what kept him from the fair so long For he believed &amp; did his follys scoff That Mary fancied he had left her off &amp; at the fair in hurt loves jealous whim To be revenged took up with Footman Tim Thus Simon thought &amp; often stopt his song To curse lost Dobbin that had caused the wrong Soon Sunday came &amp; to make worse the matter Rain drops from off the eves did quickly patter He heard it while abed for sorrow aches Around the heart &amp; haunts it while it wakes Sad sad he listened to the pattering sound While every plash left hope a deeper wound Ere the gray cock nights watchman did supprise Nights startled sleep &amp; bid the sun to rise &amp; up he got &amp; with an anxious eye From out the window looked upon the sky That darkly glowered as if it meant to last Raining away so thickly &amp; so fast That every drop made bubbles as they fell In the mossed duckpond &amp; uncovered well While brimming ruts did headlong journeys go As if like springs they ever meant to flow Vain hope what is it as its sun declines A balm on which the sick heart feeds &amp; pines &amp; many a heart from whence its rapture came Is nothing now but memory &amp; a name Victims of love that cheated them too long Sunk to the burthen of a mournful song But Simon tho perplext felt not that smart So deep that endeth in a broken heart Of ruder mould was he &amp; ruder form That like the oak grows stubborn in a storm Not like the weaker sort that bend &amp; sigh &amp; at a frown cling to despair &amp; die The rain it ceased at noon the sky looked thro The breaking clouds in many a patch of blue As breaks the thick ice in a sudden thaw Showing the bottom of the brook below When Simon instantly from off the nail His bran new beaver reached &amp; without fail Brushed oer the plashy fields &amp; dripping stiles Careless of shortening day &amp; lengthening miles For Marys smiles would be to him as light &amp; make een sunshine of the darkest night &amp; so they ought for ere he reached the place The sun sunk low &amp; bade good night apace &amp; while the spire peeped oer the woodland bough He stopt to whipe the moisture from his brow Asking a shepherd where the farm might be About the town where Mary lived—&amp; he Scarce raised him on his elbow from his lare &amp; holding out his sheephook halooed “there” When on his greedy ear her well known voice Ecchoed amain &amp; made his heart rejoice As in a milking nook she called her cows When on he sped &amp; hid among the boughs Of black thorn growing in disorder near The sad revealings of her mind to hear For grief in solitude will tell tho vain Its sorrows to itself to ease the pain That stifling silence round the heart inurned Simon thus much by self experience learned So down he dropt amid the thickets shade To list unseen the unsuspecting maid Staining his garments with the bruising grass For he thought little of his sunday dress Nor was his expectation long decieved Her sighs soon told him how her heart was grieved &amp; while the brook in mingling mutterings ran She milked &amp; thus her sad complaint began ‘Fye Simon fye to seem to love so true ‘Your heedless follys know not what they do ‘My hearts nigh broken with his broken vow ‘I feel so sad I scarce can milk my cow ‘Yet none will free me from my sunday toil ‘So I must milk &amp; sunday gowns must spoil ‘&amp; spoil they may—I feel in loves despair ‘Few are the number I shall live to wear ‘Simons unkindness made all pleasures vain ‘&amp; left me wounds that cannot heal again ‘Ungrateful man to do as he hath done ‘To take my pails that I the dirt might shun ‘&amp; lay fresh stones when eer the brook was high ‘That I might cross in safety &amp; be dry ‘Then all at once to fling me from his mind ‘Nor een on memory turn a look behind ‘Around me as he did like Ivy cling ‘&amp; then to spurn me like a poison thing ‘Dear what a terror of suspence Im in ‘My heart een heaves my bosom to my chin ‘&amp; swelled with troubles that I could not see ‘Unpins my kerchief as it would be free ‘But sad to think of that can never be ‘I felt no joy in fussy Footman Tim ‘Twas downright malice made me notice him ‘&amp; vain I tryed to yield &amp; he to win ‘For love &amp; malice claim but small akin ‘False Simon first my foolish heart beguiled ‘&amp; to none else will it be reconsiled ‘Would I could pluck his memory from my mind ‘Just as a dewdrop trembles from the wind ‘O dear I cannot for my heart must own ‘The pain it feeleth to be left alone ‘To weep unseen &amp; all unheard to sigh ‘Left all to silent loneliness am I ‘Save that the Robin every time I come ‘Peepeth &amp; makes me welcome to his home ‘Leaving in neighbouring bush its mossy nest ‘To visit &amp; invite me for its guest ‘Perk nimble thing were I but half as free ‘&amp; half as happy I might sing with thee ‘Thy love proves true but mine was false &amp; bad ‘&amp; that which makes thee happy makes me sad ‘—Well foolish griefs are follys many say ‘&amp; longs the night that never looks for day ‘Well if the roads are bad &amp; love unkind ‘Ive got my pattens still so never mind ‘Thank heaven Im neither blind or lame to need ‘A arm to lean on or a guide to lead ‘Yet will my heart be sad’ so said her sighs As she turned up her apron to her eyes Simon heard all &amp; from his hiding place Rushed out &amp; caught her in his hearts embrace Cheered was his soul forgetting former toil Glad as the hope that meets a lovers smile Warmth did away the bashfulness of love Leaving no pause to fear she might reprove Alarm in her denials put to strife &amp; waked past pleasures into sudden life Lost in his arms loves reverie beguiles &amp; kisses dry her sorrows into smiles Till burning joy that speech to each denied Did into reasons cooler light subside Then Simon up &amp; told her all &amp; how Misfortunes fell &amp; made him break his vow &amp; laid it all to Dobbin who at large Unfound remained as heedless of the charge He told what kept him from the fair so long She heard with joy yet grieved she judged so wrong &amp; from that night both pledged eternal love Leaving the rest to him who rules above &amp; Simon when they parted in delight Could not help singing tho twas sunday night &amp; sung so loud too on his homeward way That birds awoke &amp; thought it must be day &amp; day it was before he reached the farm Where gaping wonder with enquirey warm On tiptoe stood to question his delay Where he had been &amp; why he chose to stay But silence whom no bribe can force to speak Kept close her lips &amp; left them still to seek Time went on smooth &amp; gaily with him now &amp; glad as larks that sung him to his plough He toiled &amp; sung &amp; labour seemed as nought While Marys smiles had share of every thought Save now &amp; then as oer his memory crost The thought of Dobbin whom all reckoned lost &amp; many a week went bye &amp; grew agen To two whole months of mystery &amp; then With ribs nigh bare &amp; shoulders gauled &amp; sore One morn they found him at the stable door Waiting as not forgot the accustomed corn Which he was wont to share of every morn Hodge spied him first &amp; with a joyous shout Cried “heres old dobbin”—when from breakfast out Came all &amp; joy in every face did burn Pleased as are mothers when their sons return One clapped his sides one did his memory bless While Dobbins looks bespoke his hearts distress Low hung his lip nor in his former way Did he give signs of frolic or of play Yet when his name was called with freshened will He prickt his ears as if he knew it still The Farmer cursed the thieves he hoped to track &amp; clapped old Dobbin as right welcome back &amp; gave him extra corn &amp; extra rest Till he grew fat &amp; frolic as the best When he his former fame revived again For breaking gaps &amp; getting in the grain &amp; oft in after years with memorys mirth Simon raised laughter round his cottage hearth With tales of Dobbins strange eventful life When happy Mary had become his wife Who often laughed while in his elbow chair He told the cause that kept him from the fair &amp; all the pains then felt now banished hence Since Marys love had made them reccompence Nay kisses now he claimed back debts to pay &amp; thus the winters evening wore away Blessed each with each like birds in summer weather Light was the chain that joined their hearts together ADVENTURES OF A GRASSHOPPER A grasshopper idle the whole summer long Played about the tall grass with unthinking delight &amp; spent the whole day with his hopping &amp; song &amp; sipp'd of the dew for his supper at night Thus night brought him food &amp; the red rising sun Awoke him fresh fed to his singing agen &amp; thus he went on with his frolic &amp; fun Till winter winds whistled &amp; where was he then The plain wore no longer the hue of his wing All withered &amp; brown as a desert could be In vain he looked round for the shelter of spring While the longest green sprig scarcely reached to his knee The rime feathered night fell as white as a sheet &amp; dewdrops were frozen before they could fall The shy creeping sun too denied him his heat Thus the poor silly soul was deserted of all The ant had forewarned him of what he would be When he laughed at his toil on the parched summer plain He now saw the folly he then could not see But advice taen too late is but labour in vain If he wished to work now there was nothing to find The winter told plain twas too late in the day In vain he looked round in the snow &amp; the wind Unable to toil &amp; too saddened for play He looked back &amp; sighed on his singing &amp; racket &amp; employed the last hope he had left him to beg So he sought in the woods withered leaves for a jacket Of a rushe he made crutches &amp; limped of a leg The winds whistled round him while seeking for pity Oer the white crimping snows he went limping along Sighing sad at each cottage his sorrowful ditty But a song out of season is povertys song The first hut he came too belonged to a mouse Beneath a warm bank at the foot of a tree While dead rush &amp; grass nodded over her house &amp; made it as snug as a dwelling could be He told his sad tale &amp; the mouse as in fear Bade him work for a living &amp; shrank from his sight For she at that moment was nibbling an ear Of barley she stole from a barn over night He left her &amp; journeyed half hopeless &amp; chill &amp; met with a beetle that bustled away To a crack called his home in a sun slanting hill &amp; he'd scarce stop to hear what the beggar would say Though he held neath his arm a hugh crumble of bread Which a shepherd boy dropped on his cold dinner seat &amp; well might he haste when from danger he fled For his dog had nigh crushed him to death with his feet At the hut of an ear wig he next made a call Who crept from the cold in a down headed thistle That nodded &amp; minutely threatened to fall While winnowing by it the tempest did whistle The beggars loud rappings soon scared her from sleep &amp; her bosom for safety did terribly quake For she thought it the treading down rustle of sheep But slept undisturbed when she found the mistake Hot summers sweet minstrel the large bumble bee The one that wears clothing of tawney &amp; brown Who early in springs kindled suns we may see Booming round peeping blossoms &amp; bowing them down Our beggar tho hopeless resolved to try all &amp; came to his hut in an old rotten oak The bee thought it spring &amp; was glad at the call But frowned a denial as soon as he woke He then sought a Ladycows cottage of moss As old summer friends with as little success &amp; told his misfortunes to live by the loss She pitied but pitys no food for distress A chrysalis dwelt on the back of dead leaves In a palace of silk &amp; it gladdened his heart But wealth rarely sleeps without dreaming of thieves So she kept her door bolted &amp; bade him depart In a long hollow keck by the side of the road As tall as in summer tho withered &amp; old A long legged shepherd had taen his abode &amp; made a good shift to keep out of the cold Our beggar knocked hard at his door passing bye &amp; begged for a morsel &amp; told his despair The tennant looked out of his hole with a sigh &amp; pitied his fate—but had nothing to spare He then shunned the road &amp; went up by a hedge Where some Gnats had collected to dance in the sun &amp; the day smiled so warm neath the bushes &amp; sedge That hopes had nigh whispered the summer begun His heart even jumped at the sight of their play But ere his sad steps to their revels had come A cloud hid the sun that made night at noon day &amp; each gnat soon was missing away to his home Over hill-spotted pasture &amp; wild rushy lea A poor houseless vagabond doomed for all weathers He wandered where none was left wretched but he While the white flakey snow flew about him like feathers In vain he sought shelter &amp; down in the vale By the brook to an old hollow willow did roam &amp; there een a foot foundered slow creeping snail Had crept in before him &amp; made it her home Her door was glued up from the frost &amp; the snow As a bee in its hive she was warm in her shell &amp; the storm it might drift &amp; the wind it might blow She was safe &amp; could dream about spring in her cell He knocked &amp; begged hard een to creep in the porch If she'd no room for two in her parlour to spare But as dead as a dormouse asleep in a church All was silent &amp; still as no tennant was there Thus pleading &amp; praying &amp; all to no good Telling vainly a story of troubles &amp; wants He bethought of an old snubby oak by a wood Where flourished in summer a city of ants &amp; though they reproved him for singing &amp; play &amp; told him that winter would bring its reward He knew they were rich &amp; he hoped on his way That pitys kind ear would his sorrows regard From people so rich trifles could not be missed So he thought ere his hopes to their finish had come Though as to their giving he could not insist Yet he might from such plenty be sure of a crumb Thus he dreamed on his journey but guess his supprise When come to the place where such bustle had been A high wooden wall hid it all from his eyes &amp; an ant round about it was not to be seen Their doors were shut up till the summer returned Nor would one have come had he stood for a day Again in despair with his wants he sojourned &amp; sighed lone &amp; sad on his sorrowful way He limped on his crutches in sorrow &amp; pain With neer a hope left to indulge his distress While snows spread a carpet all over the plain &amp; hiding his path made him travel by guess He roamed through the wood where he'd fain made a stop But hunger so painful still urged him away For the oak tho it rocked like a cradle atop Was as still at its root as a midsummer day Where the leaves that the wind wirligigs to the ground &amp; feathers pruned off from the crows sooty wing Lie mid the green moss that is blooming around Undisturbed till the bird builds its nest in the spring The night came apace &amp; the clouds sailing bye Wore the copper flushed tints of the cold setting sun &amp; crows to their rime feathered forests did flye &amp; owls round about had their whoopings begun He hopped through rough hedges &amp; rude creaking wickets Till a shepherds lodgehouse in the fields met his eye Where he heard with surprise the glad chirping of crickets &amp; hoped his companions &amp; summer was nigh He paused with delight oer the chitter &amp; mirth &amp; tried to stare in thro a crack in the door While a cat half asleep on the warm cottage hearth Dreamed a mouse made the rustle &amp; bounced on the floor Our beggar half frighted to death at the sight Hopped off &amp; retreated as fast as he could Better pleased to tramp on in the star studded night Than hazard such danger for shelter &amp; food In passing a barn he a dwelling espied Where silk hangings hung round the room like a hall In a crack of the wall—once again he applied &amp; who but a spider should come at the call The Grasshopper said he was weary &amp; lost &amp; the spider gave welcome with cunning disguise Altho a hugh jiant in size to his host Our beggars heart trembled in terrors surprise When he set down before him dried wings of a fly &amp; fear made him ready to sink thro his seat For hunger found nothing its wants to supply &amp; fear had him ready to sink thro his seat Then to bed he went quaking &amp; faith well he might Where murdered things lay round the room in a heap Too true did he dream oer his dangers that night For the spider watched chances &amp; killed him asleep In the morning a cock robin hopped from his perch &amp; fluttered about by the side of the wall Where the murdering spider peeped out on the lurch &amp; thought a new beggar was going to call The Robin soon found what the spider was at &amp; killed him &amp; bore the dead beggar away But wether to bury or eat him or what Is a secret he never would tell to this day Thus idleness ever on sorrows attend &amp; often shakes hands with repentance too late Till forced to take up with a foe as a friend Then death &amp; destruction is certain as fate Had he taen the advice of the hardworking ant He had shunned the sad snares of bad company then &amp; dwelt with his brothers &amp; sisters from want &amp; lived to see summer &amp; singing again Now Anna my child to this story of truth Pay attention &amp; learn as thy reason comes on To value that sweetest of seasons thy youth Nor live to repent of its loss when its gone Shun the idle that spend all their childhood in play &amp; pass them to school without care or regret Where thy books they will show thee that this is the way To shun the sad fate which the Grasshopper met THE BIRDS &amp; ST VALENTINE Some two or three weeks before valentine day At a time when Sir Winter grew kind &amp; in play Shook hands with Miss Flora he wooed her to spare A few pretty snowdrops to stick in his hair Intending for truth as he said to resign His throne to Miss Spring &amp; her priest Valentine Which trifle he asked for before he set forth To remind him of all when he got in the north &amp; this is the reason that snowdrops appear Mid the cold of the winter so soon in the year Flora gladly complied &amp; the instant she heard Flew away with the news to each bachelor bird Who in raptures half moved on loves errands to start Their songs muttered over to get them by heart Nay the Mavis at once sung aloud in their glee &amp; looked for a spot where loves dwelling should be &amp; ever since then both in garden &amp; grove The Mavis tunes first a short ditty to love— While all the young gentlemen birds that were near Fell to trimming their jackets anew for the year One &amp; all they determined to seek for a mate &amp; thought it a folly for seasons to wait So even agreed before valentine day To join hearts in love but the ladies said nay Yet each one consented at once to resign Her heart unto Hymen on St Valentine While winter who only pretended to go Lapt himself out of sight in some hillocks of snow That behind all the rest neath the wood hedges lay So close that the sun could not drive them away Yet the gentlemen birds on their love errands flew Thinking all flora told them was nothing but true Till out winter came &amp; his frowns in a trice Turned the lady birds hearts all as hardened as ice In vain might the gentles in love sue &amp; plead They heard but not once did they notice or heed From winter they crept who in tyranny proud Yoked his horses of storms to his coach of a cloud For on Valentines morn he was raving so high Lady Spring for the life of her dare not come nigh While Floras gay feet where so numbed with the snow That she could not put on her best slippers to go Then spring she fell ill &amp; her health to regain On a sunbeam rode back to her south once again &amp; as both were the bridemaids their teazing delay Made the lady birds put off their weddings till may Some sighed their excuses &amp; feared to catch cold &amp; the redcap in mantle all bordered with gold Sore feared that the weather would spoil her fine cloaths &amp; nought but complaints through the forrest arose So St Valentine came on his journey alone In the coach of the morn for he'd none of his own &amp; put on his cassock &amp; band &amp; went in To the temple of Hymen the rights to begin Where the Mavis Thrush waited along with his bride Nor in the whole place was a lady beside The gentlemen they came alone to the saint &amp; instead of being married each made a complaint Of Sir Winter whose folly had caused the delay &amp; forced love to put off the wedding till May So the priest shook his head &amp; undrest to be gone As he had no day for his leisure but one &amp; when the May came with Miss Flora &amp; Spring They had nought but old cares &amp; new sorrows to sing For some of the lady birds ceased to be kind To their old loves &amp; changed for newcomers their mind &amp; some had resolved to keep single that year Untill St Valentine with the next should appear Then the birds sung their sorrows the whole summer long &amp; the Robin first mixed up his ills with his song He sung of his griefs—how in love hed been crost &amp; gave up his heart as eternally lost Twas burnt to a coal as sly Cupid let fall A spark that scorched through both the feathers &amp; all To cure it time tried but neer found out the way So the mark on his bosom he wears to this day &amp; when birds are all silent &amp; not a leaf seen On the trees but the ivy &amp; holly so green In frost &amp; in snow little Robin will sing To put off the sorrow that ruffles his wing &amp; that is the cause in our gardens we hear The Robins sweet note in the close of the year The Wagtail too mourned in his doubtlet of gray As if powdered with rime on a dull winters day He twittered of love—how he courted a fair Who altered her mind &amp; so made him despair In a stone pit he chose her a place for a nest But she like a wanton but made it a jest Though he dabbled in brooks to convince her how kind He would feed her with worms which he laboured to find Till he een got the ague still nought could prevail So ever since then he's been wagging his tail In the white thorn the linnet bides lonely to sing How his lady love shunned his embraces in spring Though he found out a bush that the sun had half drest With leaves quite sufficient to shelter their nest &amp; yet she forsook him no more to be seen So that is the reason he dresses in green Then aloud in his grief sings the gay speckled Thrush That changes his music on every bush— “My love she has left me to sorrow &amp; mourn “Yet I hope in my heart she'll repent &amp; return” So he tries at all notes her approval to meet &amp; that is the reason he singeth so sweet &amp; as sweet sang the Bulfinch although he confest That the anguish he felt was more deep then the rest &amp; they all marvelled much how he'd spirits to sing When to show them his anguish he held up his wing From his throat to his tail not a feather was found But what had been stained red as blood from the wound &amp; sad chirped the Sparrow of joys fled &amp; gone Of his love being lost he so doated upon So he vowed constant silence for that very thing &amp; this is the reason why Sparrows dont sing Then next came the Rook &amp; the sorrowful crow To tell birds the cause why in mourning they go Ever since their old loves their embraces forsook &amp; all seemed to pity the Crow &amp; the Rook The Jay he affected to hide his despair &amp; rather than mourn he had spirits to wear A coat of all colours yet in it some blue Denoted his passion though crossed was too true So now in lone woods he will hide him all day &amp; aloud he scolds all that intrude in his way The Magpie declared it should never be said That he mourned for a lover though fifty had fled Yet his heart all the while was so burnt &amp; distrest That it turned all the feathers coal black on his breast The birds they all marvelled but still he denied &amp; wore a black cap his deep blushes to hide So that is the reason himself &amp; his kin Wear hoods with the lappets quite under the chin Then last came the Owl grieving loud as he flew Saying how his false lover had bade him adieu &amp; though he knew not where to find her or follow Yet round their old haunts he would still whoop &amp; halloo For no sleep could he get in his sorrowful plight So that is the reason Owls halloo at night &amp; here ends the song of each woe stricken bird Now was a more pitiful story eer heard The rest was all coupled &amp; happy &amp; they Sung the old merry songs which they sung at this day &amp; good little boys when this tale they read oer Will neer have the hearts to hurt birds any more &amp; add to the griefs they already have sung By robbing their nests of their eggs &amp; their young But feel for their sufferings &amp; pity their pain Nor give them new cause of their lot to complain POEMS SUMMER IMAGES Now swathy summer by rude health embrowned Prescedence takes of rosey fingered spring &amp; laughing joy with wild flowers pranked &amp; crowned A wild &amp; giddy thing With health robust from every care unbound Comes on the zephers wing &amp; cheers the toiling clown Happy as holiday enjoying face Loud tongued &amp; “merry as a marriage bell” Thy lightsome step sheds joy in every place &amp; where the troubled dwell Thy witching charms weans them of half their cares &amp; from thy sunny spell They greet joy unawares Then with thy sultry locks all loose &amp; rude &amp; mantle laced with gems of garish light Come as of wont—for I would fain intrude &amp; in the worlds despight Share the rude mirth that thine own heart beguiles If haply so I might Win pleasure from thy smiles. Me not the noise of brawling pleasures cheer In nightly revels or in city streets But joys which sooth &amp; not distract mine ear That one at leisure meets In the green woods &amp; meadows summer shorn Or fields where beeflye greets Ones ear with mellow horn Where green swathed grasshopper on treble pipe Singeth &amp; danceth in mad hearted pranks &amp; bees go courting every flower thats ripe On baulks &amp; sunny banks &amp; droning dragon flye on rude bassoon Striveth to give god thanks In no discordant tune Where speckled thrush by self delight embued Singeth unto himself for joys amends &amp; drinks the honey dew of solitude Where happiness attends With inbred joy untill his heart oerflows Of which the worlds rude friends Naught heeding nothing knows Where the gay river laughing as it goes Plashes with easy wave its flaggy sides &amp; to the calm of heart in calmness shows What pleasure there abides To trace its sedgey banks from trouble free Spots solitude provides To muse &amp; happy be Or ruminating neath some pleasant bush On sweet silk grasses stretch me at mine ease Where I can pillow on the yielding rush &amp; acting as I please Drop into pleasant dreams or musing lie Mark the wind shaken trees &amp; cloud betravelled skye There think me how some barter joy for care &amp; waste lifes summer health in riot rude Of nature nor of natures sweets aware Where passions vain intrude These by calm musings softened are &amp; still &amp; the hearts better mood Feels sick of doing ill Here I can live &amp; at my leisure seek Joys far from cold restraints—not fearing pride Free as the winds that breath upon my cheek Rude health so long denied Where poor integrity can sit at ease &amp; list self satisfied The song of honey bees &amp; green lane traverse heedless where it goes Nought guessing till some sudden turn espies Rude battered fingerpost that stooping shows Where the snug mystery lies &amp; then a mossy spire with ivy crown Clears up the short supprise &amp; shows a peeping town &amp; see the wild flowers in their summer morn Of beauty feeding on joys luscious hours The gay convolvulus wreathing round the thorn Agape for honey showers &amp; slender kingcup burnished with the dew Of mornings early hours Like gold yminted new &amp; mark by rustic bridge oer shallow stream Cow tending boy to toil unreconsiled Absorbed as in some vagrant summer dream &amp; now in gestures wild Starts dancing to his shadow on the wall Feeling self gratified Nor fearing human thrall Then thread the sunny valley laced with streams Or forrests rude &amp; the oer shadowed brims Of simple ponds where idle shepherd dreams &amp; streaks his listless limbs Or trace hay scented meadows smooth &amp; long Where joys wild impulse swims In one continued song I love at early morn from new mown swath To see the startled frog his rout pursue &amp; mark while leaping oer the dripping path His bright sides scatter dew &amp; early lark that from its bustle flyes— To hail his mattin new &amp; watch him to the skyes &amp; note on hedgerow baulks in moisture sprent The jetty snail creep from the mossy thorn In earnest heed &amp; tremulous intent Frail brother of the morn That from the tiney bents &amp; misted leaves Withdraws his timid horn &amp; fearful vision weaves &amp; swallows heed on smoke tanned chimney top As wont be first unsealing mornings eye Ere yet the bee hath gleaned one wayward drop Of honey on his thigh &amp; see him seek morns airy couch to sing Untill the golden sky Besprents his russet wing &amp; sawning boy by tanning corn espy With clapping noise to startle birds away &amp; hear him brawl to every passer bye To know the hour of day &amp; see the uncradeled breeze refreshed &amp; strong With waking blossoms play &amp; breath eolian song I love the south west wind or low or loud &amp; not the less when sudden drops of rain Moistens my palid cheek from ebon cloud Threatening soft showers again That over lands new ploughed &amp; meadow grounds Summers sweet breath unchains &amp; wakes harmonious sounds Rich music breathes in summers every sound &amp; in her harmony of varied greens Woods meadows hedgrows cornfields all around Much beauty intervenes Filling with harmony the ear &amp; eye While oer the mingling scenes Far spreads the laughing sky &amp; wind enarmoured aspin mark the leaves Turn up their silver lining to the sun &amp; list the brustling noise that oft decieves &amp; makes the sheepboy run The sound so mimics fast approaching showers He thinks the rain begun &amp; hastes to sheltering bowers &amp; mark the evening curdle dank &amp; grey Changing her watchet hue for sombre weed &amp; moping owl to close the lids of day On drowsy wing proceed While chickering crickets tremulous &amp; long Lights farewell inly heed &amp; gives it parting song While pranking bat its flighty circlet makes &amp; gloworm burnisheth its lamp anew Oer meadows dew besprent—&amp; beetle wakes Enquires ever new Teazing each passing ear with murmurs vain As wonting to pursue His homeward path again &amp; catch the melody of distant bells That on the wind with pleasing hum rebounds By fitful starts—then musically swells Oer the dim stilly grounds While on the meadow bridge the pausing boy Listens the mellow sounds &amp; hums in vacant joy &amp; now the homebound hedger bundles up His evening faggot &amp; with every stride His leathern dublet leaves a rustling sound Till silly sheep beside His path start tremulous &amp; once again Look back dissatisfied Then scour the dewy plain &amp; greet the soothing calm that smoothly stills Oer the hearts every sense its opiate dews In meek eyed moods &amp; ever balmy trills That softens &amp; subdues With gentle quiets bland &amp; sober train Which dreamy eve renews In many a mellow strain I love to walk the fields they are to me A legacy no evil can destroy They like a spell set every rapture free That cheered me when a boy Play pastime all times blotting pen consceals Come like a new born joy To greet me in the fields For natures objects ever harmonize With emelous taste that vulgar deed anoys It loves in quiet moods to sympathise &amp; meet vibrating joys Oer natures pleasing things—nor slighting deems Pastime the muse employs As vain obtrusive themes HELPSTONE STATUTE OR THE RECRUITING PARTY Unclouded rose the morning sun Though autumns pleasant weather In promise of some glorious fun When all were got together There wa'n't a road led to the town But ye'd see clowns by dozens For masters some &amp; some for sport &amp; some to see their couzins &amp; skipping girls as sweet &amp; fair As smiles &amp; dress could make 'em With pattens in their sweethearts care Who thought it pride to take 'em They graceful lifted up their gowns To show a taper ancle Which made the hearts of following clowns With beautys visions rankle In gladdened speed awoke the morn With holiday caresses Young laughing clowns with beards new shorn &amp; girls in sunday dresses &amp; childern peeping in the street For sisters &amp; for brothers &amp; maids their coming swains to meet &amp; anxious watching mothers Horses &amp; gigs went whisking bye With farming gent &amp; lady Although twas autumns cloudy sky Joys blossomed as at may day &amp; soldiers gan their drums to rap When near the town advancing Which set like majic every chap To capering &amp; to dancing Ah Helpstone thou art droning dull Till statutes yearly find thee &amp; then thourt mad as any bull &amp; care is cast behind thee Each house where lorn the year about Signs creak to wind &amp; weather Relieved by thee &amp; balmy stout Draw scores of lads together Thy fame with vigour yearly blooms Round all the neighbouring towns Renowned for cakes well stored with plums &amp; fun that pleases clowns For civil Wills &amp; winking jades &amp; E-O tables turning Where gamesters oft are beggars made &amp; mirth is changed to mourning There merry Punch displays his pranks In squeaking jokes &amp; blunders &amp; there the pale faced mountebanks Spout loud their tale of wonders Of balsams that will blooms secure In fading belles &amp; madams &amp; for the aged lives ensure As long as father Adams The place now thronged with young &amp; old For labour had its leisure While every face its errand told As seeking mirth &amp; pleasure Sweet beauty now displayed its blooms Red cheeks &amp; lily bosoms Mirth buzzed like wild bees merry hum Round fields of clover blossoms With sweethearts hanging on their arms In blushes softly blooming Each maiden smiled in witching charms Just blossoming to woman &amp; red coat gentry soon in style For liquor 'gan a calling &amp; where their winks could meet a smile Set maids in corners squalling &amp; loose laced sergant Macaroon A hogshead sort of dandy With visage like a harvest moon &amp; nose as burnt as brandy He strutted round the room with ale &amp; drank to tittering wenches Making clowns stare at valours tale Of storming towers &amp; trenches He jested oer the battles strife As play when theyd been school to't &amp; swore that to a soldiers life King Williams were a fool to't He bragged about their mints of cash &amp; swaggered &amp; insisted Till boys that scarcely reached his sash Bawled teazing to be listed Some listened &amp; believed it true &amp; some disposed to quarrel Swore he of valour never knew A gunshot from the barrel But he bragged on &amp; spent his crowns &amp; tossed off foaming glasses A very heroe with the clowns &amp; cupid with the lasses The alehouse soon was in a rout &amp; all was helter skelter &amp; Molly Meek came puffing out She said twas fit to melt her The truth on't was that Coporal Sly Had won her with his feather &amp; secret whispered by &amp; by To trample out together A sweetheart she to Booby Briggs Who soons he cleared the trick up Cursed all the redcoats rougish rigs &amp; rumptions 'gan kick up They cocked their consequential caps &amp; sneering filled their glasses Saying theyd make lords of straw yard chaps &amp; ladies of the lasses But Boobys heart was bad for fight He could but rave &amp; rattle &amp; when hed broke the peace his spite Most cooly shunned the battle The row got high boards gan to fall Where stood the pipes &amp; cans on &amp; alewife swore revenge on all She eer could lay her hands on &amp; in she bounced with face as red As if twas daubed with riddle &amp; first gan thump the fiddlers head O fun protect the fiddle The scrapers fist was soon for blows Ales courage rarely failed him &amp; wo'd been to her brandy nose If lasses hadnt quailed him He loved the wenches monstrous well &amp; never wished to teaze 'em But gloried in his fiddling skill That had the power to pleaze 'em &amp; when hed found his trampled hat Mid broken pipes &amp; glasses With vengance half appeased he sat &amp; struck up “Bonny Lasses” She soon broke up the fighting rout By soldier lads assisted &amp; sharply played the sticks about The rebels that resisted She boldly shoved &amp; showed the door In spite of oaths &amp; cavil Some cursed—&amp; staggered while they swore &amp; wished her to the devil But broken pots &amp; broken pipes All that were slain in battle Made her for vengance fury-ripe &amp; loud her tongue did rattle Till brawlings loud for quarts of ale &amp; sound of money chinking Did bye &amp; bye her vengance quail &amp; peace was signed by drinking The Statute now was all in mobs Each maiden interposes Swooning with heartbursting sobs Oer sweethearts bloody noses Een boys bethought em men that day As highs ones knee &amp; hardly &amp; stript &amp; bruised amid the fray &amp; acted most blackguardly At length with bruizing softened down Those not so full of mettle Got weary trying for renown &amp; battle gan to settle &amp; soon the aid of pipe &amp; pot Made up for hits &amp; misses In corners some with sweethearts got To cure black eyes with kisses &amp; Coporal Sly had played his rigs &amp; Moll had proved his jesting Who sneaked agen to Booby Briggs Her innoscence protesting No maid could simper more demure &amp; keep such meek parade up Poor Booby thought it true besure &amp; matters soon were made up To put a Soldiers heart in thrall He thought her mighty clever &amp; then prize Booby after all He loved her more then ever &amp; while his purse had sixpence int With kindnesses he paid [her] &amp; gifts almost without a stint Of nuts &amp; cakes he made her The Soldiers now began to drum &amp; gaping stood the ninneys To see the sergant neath his thumb Hold out the tempting guineas &amp; rustics tempted at the sight Their parents tears were scorning &amp; ranting oer their quarts till night Left sorrow for the morning Some ere the daylight wore away Went home with lovers happy &amp; others still inclined to stay Sat ranting oer their nappy Some drunk &amp; weary sunk to rest On leaning chairs reposing &amp; others lay more hap'ly blest On sweethearts bosoms dozing Soul stirring ale thy laurelled brow Blooms an immortal fairly Or long as England yokes a plough &amp; summers ripen barley &amp; curse the wretch who craving chink Thy fame with drugs defaces I wish him hell denied of drink Who thus thy worth debases Thus passed the day &amp; weary night Found some with empty purses &amp; some that scaped with hasty flight From battles blows &amp; curses &amp; some with headaches shoots severe Felt the last tankards drainings While maidens wept with secret fear Uncurable complainings OUR OWN FIRESIDE Our firesides easy chair Is there any place beside Can such pleasant cheer prepare As our own fireside Tho humble be the fare That wants daily toils provide Daintys pomp can neer compare With the joy want meeteth there By his own fireside He may wish a better lot With his own dissatisfied Yet he'll never find a spot Like his own fireside With his little ones at play &amp;

hope They who with his wants abide Who from sorrows neer elope Are the little honest group By his own fireside They who love him till he dies Who through troubles have been tried They who weep deaths closing eyes When all are cold beside Can such honest hearts abound In this worlds deciet &amp; pride O its all enjoyed &amp; found In that little circle round Our own fireside The wanderer may have friends That for present needs provide Yet they make but small amends For his own fireside They whove been the longest kind They who first his wants supplied They who bare him most in mind Are the friends he left behind Round his own fireside He may after fortune stray &amp; with providence his guide Meet with comforts as he may By a strange fireside The kindest favours shown Are by stranger tongues applied Home lives not in the tone &amp; he feels himself alone From his own fireside He may ride a horse to death He may speed with time &amp; tide He shall find no spot on earth Like his own fireside Tho a cold stone were his seat Yet to kindred closely tied Where his wife &amp; childern meet O theres neer a spot so sweet As his own fireside Man tho honest may be poor &amp; may feel an honest pride While he counts his troubles oer By his own fireside Wealth may very easy fall From his fortune &amp; his pride Yet he's not the worst of all While he owns a place to call His own fireside Though the soldier in the war Courteth honour as a bride Doth he never turn from far To his own fireside Yes he often feels the pain Though he strives the sigh to hide While he wishes when in vain For the rest &amp; peace again Of his own fireside The sailor tossed in storms Tho all fears he doth deride Loves that snug spot free from harms By his own fireside &amp; imprisoned on the sea By every peril tried O he'd give his all to be In that port at anchor free By his own fireside I have oft been plentys guest Where forms welcome did abide &amp; my heart was ill at rest From my own fireside Tho but poor my homely fare Yet I felt I'd all beside &amp; the welcome I should share From the little circle there Round my own fireside In this chimneys sooty nook I with pleasure can abide Tho the walls are dyed in smoke Tis my own fireside Wealth may boast its splendid hall Carpet floor &amp;

towers But speeds with soft &amp; gentle flight Among these valley flowers Theres music in the waking woods Theres glory in the air Birds in their merry summer moods Now rant &amp; revel there Joy wakes &amp; wantons all around Love laughs in every call Music in many hearts abounds &amp; poesy breaths in all The merry newcome Nightingale Woos nights dull hours along Till daylight at the sound turns pale &amp; hastes to share the song A waste of sunny flowers is seen &amp; insence fills the air No sunless place is found too mean Springs blushing gems to wear The horse blob by the water mill Blooms in the foaming dam &amp; pilewort blazes round the hill Beside the sleeping lamb Spring is the happy breathing time For young loves stolen joys Spring is the poets luscious prime He revels in the noise Of waking insects humming round Of birds upon the wing &amp; all the gushing soul of sound That echoes of the spring For in their joys his own are met Tho tears stand in his eye In their gay mirth he half forgets He eer knew how to sigh He feeds on springs precarious boon A being of her race Where light &amp; shade &amp; shower &amp; sun Are ever changing place To day he buds &amp; glows to meet To morrows promised shower When crushed by cares intruding feet He fades a broken flower His hopes they change like summer clouds &amp; fairy phantasies His pleasures wrapt in gayer shrouds Are sorrows in disguise The sweetest smiles his heart can find Possess their tears as well &amp; highest pleasures leave behind Their heartache &amp; farewell His are the fading “joys of grief” Care grows his favoured guest &amp; sorrow gives his heart relief Because it knows him best The sweetest flower on pleasures path Will bloom on sorrows grave &amp; earthly love &amp; earthly mirth Their share of grief shall have &amp; poesy owns a haunted mind A thirst enduring flame Burning the soul to leave behind The memory of a name Though life he deemed as sweetly sold For toil so ill repaid The marble epitaph how cold Although with gold inlaid While the rude clown of thoughtless clay In feelings unrefined Lives out lifes cloudless holiday With nothing on his mind Then sound as ever king hath slept On earths green lap he lies While beautys tear so sweetly wept &amp; friendships warmest sighs Are left upon his lowly grave &amp; live his only fame While frowning envy never gave One insult to his name Yet who would from their cares be free For such unconsious bliss A living blank in life to be Pains sympathy to miss To meet enthusiastic May As but dull winters hours &amp; primrose pale &amp; daisy gay As white &amp; yellow flowers &amp; not as friends in our esteem To cheer dull lifes sojourn Let me throughout its cheating dream Much rather feel &amp; mourn The bliss or grief tho past controul That with extremes inflame Blood rushing feelings through the soul Not uttered in a name Where no words live to free the mind Of hidden hopes or fears The only utterance they can find Are gushing smiles &amp; tears Yet woo I not that burning flame Enkindling ecstasy Blazing in dreams to win a name From fames eternity Fames yearning breath breeds not my sigh Nor eats my heart away Burning lifes every channel dry To triumph oer decay Yet with the minstrelsy on earth I too would love the lyre For heaven neer gave the meanest birth To quench that holy fire It owns the muses sweetest smiles &amp; scatters life around Grief sick with hopes heart broken toils Glows happy at the sound The lyre is pleasures blest abode &amp; round it angels throng The lyre it is the voice of God The prophets spoke in song &amp; as the sun this day brings forth Creations every hour Cares wreath warms at the muses mirth &amp; blushes into flower ON SEEING A SKULL ON COWPER GREEN One morn I wandered forth neath spirits high Those moods that mornings peering breath instills &amp; like my shade my mind in ecstasy Stretched like a jiant oer the pasture hills I mused on reasoning mans exalted sway Oer the brute world—pride made my feelings brave Creations lord to me he seemed that day I felt as if all nature was his slave But times glass soon did mock my visioned might I saw &amp; shrunk an insect at the sight For as I wandered by a quarrys side Where an old hoary weatherbeaten swain Was delving sand—in lifes rude troubles tried An humble pittance natures boon to gain He stopt his toil &amp; with a feeble hand Pointed to where a human skull lay bare &amp; mingled with the refuse of the land Fallen from life &amp; pride to moulder there I looked upon the relic with deep awe While silence seemed to question what I saw What wert thou upon earth perhaps a king For such the relics of earths best renown Thou pompous shadow thou proud trifling thing Bare is the brow that triumphed neath a crown By rank forsaken stript of prides attire Deaths sad reality fate only claims All else like shadows bidden to expire Time keeps the wreck to mock at earthly fames To show vain glory in its golden birth Of what poor value it is held by death Wert thou a tyrant that disdained though clay The laws of God &amp; man &amp; with vain power For earths vain glories threw the heavens away How art thou fallen at this lonely hour Thy vengance that did like the thunder sear Ordaining hosts of murders at a breath Hath vanished &amp; the slave forgot his fear Beneath the banner of that tyrant death Even the little ant now undismayed Creeps oer thy skull &amp; feeleth not afraid A warrior thou who sped in victorys ways As overbearing as a mighty wind Ah little thought thy pride that victorys praise So soon would leave her heroes fame behind From war &amp; all its havoc long deterred Thy courage withering in its mad career Bowed before death tame as a broken sword &amp; ah how silent doth it harbour here Its fame all sunk to nothingness away As showers by night was[h] out the steps of day Wert thou a lover ah what else so warm As lovers thoughts that lead the heart to bliss How sad the change in deaths oertaken storm Cold wrecked &amp; stranded in a place like this Love that will nestle neath the eagles wing &amp; find a dwelling in the lions den Hath long forsaken thee thou lonely thing Of mystery &amp; knows thee not agen Warm hopes gay thoughts rapt joys &amp; fond desires Have lost their home death put out all their fires Wert thou a poet who in fancys dream Saw immortality throw by her veil &amp; all thy labours in fames temple gleam In the proud glory of an aftertale If so how cheated thy ambition died How vain the hopes the muses visions gave Death with eternity scarce took one stride Ere thou wert left forgotten in the grave Chilled all thy powers with thoughts oerflowing full &amp; nought left extant but this empty skull Wert thou of poor descent &amp; like to me A toiling worm to earn lifes daily bread If so death made thee rich as well as free &amp; left thee equal with the noblest dead Emperors &amp; kings no more by flattery fed Poor as thou art their condescension spares Even to thee a portion of their bed &amp; thines as soft a pillow now as theirs &amp; who could grudge the mightys guest to be Where kings grow kind &amp; share their pomp with thee In vain I question nought will answer me Of what thou wert yet know I that thou art A faithful portrait of what life shall be Thus much thy mystic vision doth impart King Tyrant Warrior Lover Bard &amp; all Shall into nothing every name resign &amp; fames proud scroll at last shall be the pall To hide them as oblivion hideth thine While virtues deeds shall longest live &amp; be A wreath to girdle vast eternity PURSUITS AFTER HAPPINESS Some climb ambitions hill with many toils &amp; follow hope at length to hopless be Some seek for quiet in contentions broils &amp; suffer shipwreck that go not to sea Some seeming warned a new consciet betrays To worship phantoms who reward in pain Vain follys fancys running divers ways Seeking for somthing which they neer attain Where truth meets foes &amp; honesty no friends Where good intents are ever ill repaid Where highest merit earneth worst amends &amp; closest friendships soonest are betrayed Where bribes &amp; lies to honours place aspires The props wereby ambition stays its fall If to shun aught of these thy heart desires Shun vain ambitions &amp; so shun them all Pride thus aye seeketh &amp; so findeth not Wearing vain flatterys phrases all threadbare While the poor shepherd swain in lowley cot Finds without seeking &amp; has joys to spare The ploughman blythe that whistles toil away &amp; oer the russet land aye speeds his plough On pleasures lap fares sumptious every day With laughing Maud who milks the brinded cow To seek where pleasaunce in her mirth carouses As from ambition to flee far away &amp; join where buxsome health wild mirth espouses &amp; all rejoiceth at the holiday To laugh with shepherd Ralph &amp; milking Molly Who on the haycocks fare so merrily Who in gray russet taunt at melancholly &amp; always laughing find no room to sigh Where trees &amp; hedges &amp; astonished bushes Are filled with music as if music grew From happy blackbirds &amp; delighted thrushes Who daub their nests &amp; love in happy cue Where little blackcaps in their early song Do calm the march winds with their merry throats &amp; cuckoo singeth blythe ere it be long A full toned anthem with two simple notes There trim a little garden at ones leisure To watch the flowers to bud &amp; so to bloom To reap from present labour added pleasure &amp; have an hour for talk when friends do come Hoeing up weeds that bed &amp; path deforms &amp; smoothing grassplots with a roll &amp; scythe While tiney Robin poppeth down for worms Then strokes his little bill &amp; singeth blythe Spending an hour with quiet now &amp; then By flood washed river &amp; sedge flounced pool Musing like hermit from the haunts of men Indulging idless like a child from school To find on leaning tree an easy chair Where one can sit &amp; bid the minutes pass &amp; mark the dodging float sink speedy there Then land the large bream bouncing on the grass Or seek out spots where nature doth disport In curious phantasy her whims to please Where the minds eye may shape a princely court Without its cares from intertwining trees Or muse in grottos by rock hidden spring Where fairey folk from summers noon retires There feel the place a throne oneself a king With nought to govern but ones own desires Safe are such antidotes such means supply For what decayed ambition aye endures &amp; hearts grown sick of show may meet therebye Coy pleasures long pursued &amp; speedy cures Tis but vain fashions tinsel gauds to shun &amp; speed where health &amp; happiness employs The simple swain to labour in the sun Tending his toils therebye to share his joys So would I live like such so pass away When winter comes like any other flye Sinking to sleep forgetting it were day In pleasant nook with natures kind to lye Who for their monuments plant flowers not stones Whose epitaphs the little birds doth sing Whose graves are not dull heaps of charnel bones But shrines where seasons memorys offerings bring MAYING OR LOVE &amp; FLOWERS Upon a day a merry day When summer in her best Like Sunday belles prepares for play &amp; joins each merry guest A maid as wild as is the bird That never knew a cage Went out her parents kine to herd &amp; Jockey as her page Would need go join her merry toils A silly shepherd he &amp; little thought the aching broils That in his heart would be For he as yet knew nought of love &amp; nought of love knew she Yet without learning love can move The wildest to agree He gathered flowers a pleasing task To crown her queen of may But dare not give nor would she ask So threw them all away Then from her path she turned aside &amp; took a double pain To gather others far &amp; wide &amp; so he sighed again The wind enarmoured of the maid Around her drapery swims &amp; moulds in luscious masquerade Her lovely shape &amp; limbs Smiths “Venus stealing Cupids bow” In marble hides as fine But hers was life &amp; soul—whose glow Makes meaner things divine In sooth she was a lovely toy A worship moving thing As ever brought the season joy Or beautified the spring So sweet a thing no heart might hurt Gay as a butterflye Though Cupid chased twas half in sport He meant not to destroy When speaking—words with breathing grace Her sweet lips seemly wooed Pausing to leave so sweet a place Ere they could part for good Those lips that pouted from her face As a rosey bursts the bud Which June so eager to embrace Tempts from beneath its hood Her eyes like suns did seem to light The beautys of her face Streaming up her forhead white &amp; cheeks of rosey grace Her bosom swelled to pillows large Till her so taper waist Scarce able seemed to bear the charge Of each lawn bursting breast A very flower how did she shine Her beautys all displaying In sooth this modern Proserpine Might set the angels maying As like a fairy mid the flowers She flew to this—now that— &amp; some she braided in her hair Some wreathed within her hat Then off she skipt in bowers to hide By Cupid led I ween Putting her bosoms lawn aside To place some thyme atween The shepherd saw her skin so white Two twin suns newly risen Though love had chained him there till night Who would have shunned the prison Then off again she skipt &amp; flew With foot so light &amp; little That Cinderellas fairy shoe Had fit her to a tittle The shepherds heart like blazing coal Beat as 'twould leave the socket He sighed but thought it silly fool The watch within his pocket &amp; then he tried a song to sing But sighs arose &amp; dropt it He thought the winds poor silly thing Blew in his face &amp; stopt it &amp; then he tried to sing again But sighs again did flutter Around his heart—&amp; ‘what a pain’ Was all that he could utter ‘Fair flower’ said he ‘Whose that’ quoth she &amp; tied her flowers together Then sought for more ‘ah woe is me’ He said or sighed it rather Then grasped her arm that soft &amp; white Like to a pillow dinted &amp; blushing red as at a bite His fingers there were printed &amp; ah he sighed to mark the sight That unmeant rudeness hinted And Daphne like she blushed &amp; flew Tho but to vex his pain And soon to see if hed pursue She turned to smile again And like a bird with injured wing That flutters but not flies She waited for the sheepish thing To catch her by surprise But bold in love grow silly sheep &amp; so right bold grew he He ran she fled &amp; at bo-peep She met him round a tree A thorn enarmoured like the swain Caught at her lily arm &amp; then good faith to ease her pain Love had a double charm She sighed he wished it well I wis The place was sadly swollen And then he took a willing kiss And made believe twas stolen Then made another make believe Till thefts grew past concealing For when love once begins to thieve Their grows no end to stealing They played &amp; toyed till down the skies The sun had taken flight And still a sun was in her eyes To keep away the night And there he talked of love so well Or else he talked so ill That soon the priest was sought to tell The story better still THOUGHTS IN A CHURCHYARD Ah happy spot how still it seems Where crowds of buried memorys sleep How quiet nature oer them dreams Tis but our troubled thoughts that weep Lifes book shuts here its page is lost With them &amp; all its busy claims The poor are from its memory crost The rich have nothing but their names There rest the weary from their toil There lye the troubled free from care Who through the strife of lifes turmoil Sought rest &amp; only found it there With none to fear his scornful brow There sleep the master &amp; the slave &amp; heedless of all titles now Repose the honoured &amp; the brave There rest the miser &amp; the heir Both careless who their wealth shall reap Een love found cures for heartaches there &amp; none enjoys a sounder sleep The fair one far from follys freaks As quiet as her neighbour seems Unconsious now of rosey cheeks &amp; neer a rival in her dreams Strangers alike to joy &amp; strife Heedless of all its past affairs Theyre blotted from the list of life And absent from its teasing cares Grief joy hope fear &amp; all their crew That haunt the memorys living mind Ceased where they could no more pursue &amp; left a painless blank behind Lifes ignis fatus light is gone No more to lead their hopes astray Cares poisoned cup is drained &amp; done &amp; all its follys far away The bills made out the reckoning paid The book is crossed the business done On them the last demand is made &amp; deaths long happy sleep is won THE VANITYS OF LIFE “Vanitys of vanitys all is vanity” Solomon What are lifes joys &amp; gains What pleasures crowd its ways That man should take such pains To seek them all his days Sift this untoward strife On which thy mind is bent See if this chaff of life Is worth the trouble spent Is pride thy hearts desire Is power thy climbing aim Is love thy follys fire Is wealth thy restless game Pride power love wealth &amp; all Times touchstone shall destroy &amp; like base coin prove all Vain substitutes for joy Dost think that pride exalts Thyself in others eyes &amp; hides thy follys faults Which reason will despise Dost strut &amp; turn &amp; stride Like walking weathercocks The shadow by thy side Becomes thy ape &amp; mocks Dost think that powers disguise Can make thee mighty seem It may in follys eyes But not in worths esteem When all that thou canst ask &amp; all that she can give Is but a paltry mask Which tyrants wear &amp; live Go let thy fancys range &amp; ramble where they may View power in every change &amp; what is its display —The country magistrate The meanest shade in power To rulers of the state The meteors of an hour— View all &amp; mark the end Of every proud extreme Where flattery turns a friend &amp; counterfiets esteem Where worth is aped in show That doth her name purloin Like toys of golden glow Thats sold for copper coin Ambitions haughty nod With fancys may decieve Nay tell thee thourt a God &amp; wilt thou such believe —Go bid the seas be dry Go hold earth like a ball Or throw thy fancys bye For God can do it all Dost thou possess the dower Of laws to spare or kill Call it not heavenly power When but a tyrants will Know what a God will do &amp; know thyself a fool Nor tyrant like pursue Where he alone should rule O put away thy pride Or be ashamed of power That cannot turn aside The breeze that waves a flower Or bid the clouds be still Though shadows they can brave Thy poor power mocking will Then make not man a slave Dost think when wealth is won Thy heart has its desire Hold ice up to the sun &amp; wax before the fire Nor triumph oer the reign Which they so soon resign In this worlds ways they gain Insurance safe as thine Dost think lifes peace secure In houses &amp; in land Go read the fairey lure To twist a chord of sand Lodge stones upon the sky Hold water in a sieve Nor give such tales the lie &amp; still thine own believe Whoso with riches deals &amp; thinks peace bought &amp; sold Will find them slippery eels That slide the firmest [h]old Though sweet as sleep with health Thy lulling luck may be Pride may oerstride thy wealth &amp; check prosperity Dost think that beautys power Lifes sweetest pleasure gives Go pluck the summer flower &amp; see how long it lives Behold the rays glide on Along the summer plain Ere thou canst say “theyre gone” &amp; measure beautys reign Look on the brightest eye Nor teach it to be proud But view the clearest sky &amp; thou shalt find a cloud Nor call each face ye meet An angels cause its fair But look beneath your feet &amp; think of what they are Who thinks that love doth live In beautys tempting show Shall find his hopes ungive &amp; melt in reasons thaw Who thinks that pleasure lies In every fairey bower Shall oft to his suprise Find poison in the flower Dost lawless pleasures grasp Judge not thou dealst in joy Its flowers but hide the asp Thy revels to destroy Who trusts an harlots smiles &amp; by her wiles are led Plays with a sword the while Hung dropping oer his head Dost doubt my warning song Then doubt the sun gives light Doubt truth to teach thee wrong &amp; wrong alone as right &amp; live as lives the knave Intrigues decieving guest Be tyrant or be slave As suits thy ends the best Or pause amid thy toils For visions won &amp; lost &amp; count the fancied spoils If ere they quit the cost &amp; if they still possess Thy mind as worthy things Plat straws with bedlam Bess &amp; call them diamond rings Thy follys past advice Thy hearts already won Thy falls above all price So go &amp; be undone For all who thus prefer The seeming great for small Shall make wine vinegar &amp; sweetest honey gall Wouldst heed the truths I sing To profit wherewithall Clip follys wanton wing &amp; keep her within call Ive little else to give What thou canst easy try The lesson how to live Is but to learn to die CHILDHOOD The past it is a majic word Too beautiful to last It looks back like a lovely face Who can forget the past Theres music in its childhood Thats known in every tongue Like the music of the wildwood All chorus to the song The happy dream the joyous play The life without a sigh The beauty thoughts can neer pourtray In those four letters lye The painters beauty breathing arts The poets speaking pens Can neer call back a thousand part Of what that word contains &amp; fancy at its sweetest hour What eer may come to pass Shall find that majic thrill no more Time broke it like his glass The sweetest joy the fairest face The treasure most preferred Have left the honours of their place Locked in that silent word When we look back on what we were &amp; feel what we are now A fading leaf is not so drear Upon a broken bough A winter seat without a fire A cold world without friends Doth not such chilly glooms impart As that one word portends Like withered wreaths in banquet halls When all the rout is past Like sunshine that on ruins falls Our pleasures are at last The joy is fled the love is cold &amp; beautys splendour too Our first believings all are old &amp; faith itself untrue When beauty met loves budding spring In artless witcherys It were not then an earthly thing But an angel in disguise Where are they now of youths esteems All shadows past away Flowers blooming but in summer dreams &amp; thoughts of yesterday Our childhood soon a trifle gets Yet like a broken toy Grown out of date it reccolects Our memorys into joy The simple catalogue of things That reason would despise Starts in the heart a thousand springs Of half forgotten joys When we review that place of prime That childhoods joys endow That seemed more green in winter time Than summer grass does now Where oft the task of skill was put For other boys to match To run along the churchyard wall Or balls to cuck &amp; catch How oft we clomb the porch to cut Our names upon the leads Though fame nor anything akin Was never in our heads Where hands &amp; feet were rudely drawn &amp; names we could not spell &amp; thought no artist in the world Could ever do as well We twirled our tops that spun so well They scarce could tumble down &amp; thought they twirled as well again When riddled on the crown &amp; bee-spell marbles bound to win As by a potent charm Was often wetted in the mouth To show the dotted swarm We pelted at the weathercock &amp; he who pelted oer Was reckoned as a mighty man &amp; even somthing more We leapt accross “cat gallows sticks” &amp; mighty proud was he Who overshot the famous nicks That reached above his knee &amp; then each others tasks we did &amp; great ambition grew We ran so swift so strong we leaped We almost thought we flew We ran across the broken brig Whose wooden rail was lost &amp; loud the victors feat was hailed Who dared the danger most &amp; hopskotch too a spur to joy We thought the task divine To hop &amp; kick the stone right out &amp; never touch a line &amp; then we walked on mighty stilts Scarce seven inches high Yet on we stalked &amp; thought ourselves Already at the sky Our pride to reason would not shrink In these exalted hours A jiants was a pigmy link To statures such as ours We even fancied we could flye &amp; fancy then was true So with the clouds upon the sky In dreams at night we flew We shot our arrows from our bows Like any archers proud &amp; thought when lost they went so high To lodge upon a cloud &amp; these seemed feats that none before Ourselves could eer attain &amp; Wellington with all his feats Felt never half so vain &amp; oft we urged the barking dog For mischief was our glee To chace the cat up weed green walls &amp; mossy apple tree When her tail stood like a bottle brush With fear—we laughed again Like tyrants we could purchase mirth &amp; neer alow for pain &amp; then our playpots sought &amp; won For uses &amp; for show That Wedgewoods self with all his skill Might guess in vain to know &amp; pallaces of stone &amp; stick In which we could not creep Which Nash himself neer made so quick &amp; never half so cheap Our fancys made us great &amp; rich No bounds our wealth could fix A stool drawn round the room was soon A splendid coach &amp; six The majic of our minds was great &amp; even pebbles they Soon as we chose to call them gold Grew guineas in our play &amp; carriages of oyster shells Though filled with nought but stones Grew instant ministers of state While clay kings filled their thrones Like Cinderellas fairey queen Joy would our wants bewitch If wealth was sought the dust &amp; stones Turned wealth &amp; made us rich The mallow seed became a cheese The henbanes loaves of bread A burdock leaf our table cloth On a table stone was spread The bindweed flower that climbs the hedge Made us a drinking glass &amp; there we spread our merry feast Upon the summer grass A henbane root could scarcely grow A mallow shake its seeds The insects that might feed thereon Found famine in the weeds But like the pomp of princely taste That humbler life anoys We thought not of our neighbours wants While we were wasting joys We often tried to force the snail To leave his harvest horn By singing that the beggarman Was coming for his corn We thought we forced the lady cow To tell the time of day Twas one oclock &amp; two oclock &amp; then she flew away We bawled to beetles as they ran That their childern were all gone Their houses down &amp; door key hid Beneath the golden stone They seemed to haste as fast again While we shouted as they past With mirth half mad to think our tale Had urged their speed so fast The stonecrop that on ruins comes &amp; hangs like golden balls How oft to reach its shining blooms We scaled the mossy walls &amp; weeds—we gathered weeds as well Of all that bore a flower &amp; tied our little poseys up Beneath the eldern bower Our little gardens there we made Of blossoms all arow &amp; though they had no roots at all We hoped to see them grow &amp; in the cart rutt after showers Of sudden summer rain We filled our tiney waterpots &amp; cherished them in vain We pulled the moss from apple trees &amp; gathered bits of straws When weary twirling of our tops &amp; shooting of our taws We made birds nests &amp; thought that birds Would like them ready made &amp; went full twenty times a day To see if eggs were laid The long &amp; swaily willow row Where we for whips would climb How sweet their shadows used to grow In merry harvest time We pulled boughs down &amp; made a swee Snug hid from toil &amp; sun &amp; up we tossed right merrily Till weary with the fun On summer eves with wild delight We bawled the bat to spy Who in the “I spy” dusky light Shrieked loud &amp; flickered bye &amp; up we tossed our shuttlecocks &amp; tried to hit the moon &amp; wondered bats should flye so long &amp; they come down so soon We sought for nutts in secret nook We thought none else could find &amp; listened to the laughing brook &amp; mocked the singing wind We gathered acorns ripe &amp; brown That hung too high to pull Which friendly winds would shake adown Till all had pockets full Then loading home at days decline Each sought his corner stool Then went to bed till morning came &amp; crept again to school Yet there by pleasure unforsook In natures happy moods The cuts in Fennings Spelling book Made up for fields &amp; woods Each noise that breathed around us then Was majic all &amp; song Where ever pastime found us then Joy never led us wrong The wild bees in the blossom hung The coy birds startled call To find its home in danger—there Was music in them all &amp; oer the first Bumbarrels nest We wondered at the spell That birds who served no prenticeship Could build their nests so well &amp; finding linnets moss was green &amp; finches chusing grey &amp; every finches nest alike Our wits was all away Then blackbirds lining theirs with grass &amp; thrushes theirs with dung So for our lives we could not tell From whence the wisdom sprung We marvelled much how little birds Should ever be so wise &amp; so we guessed some angel came To teach them from the skys In winter too we traced the fields &amp; still felt summer joys We sought our hips &amp; felt no cold Cold never came to boys The sloes appeared as choice as plumbs When bitten by the frost &amp; crabs grew honey in the mouth When apple time was past We rolled in sunshine lumps of snow &amp; called them mighty men &amp; tired of pelting Bouneparte We ran to slide agen &amp; ponds for glibbest ice we sought With shouting &amp; delight &amp; tasks of spelling all were left To get by heart at night &amp; when it came—&amp; round the fire We sat—what joy was there The kitten dancing round the cork That dangled from a chair While we our scraps of paper burnt To watch the flitting sparks &amp; Collect books were often torn For parsons &amp; for clerks Nought seemed too hard for us to do But the sums upon our slates Nought seemed too hard for us to win But the masters chair of state The “Town of Troy” we tried &amp; made When our sums we could not try While we envied een the sparrows wings From our prison house to flye When twelve oclock was counted out The joy &amp; strife began The shut of books the hearty shout As out of doors we ran Sunshine &amp; showers who could withstand Our food &amp; rapture they We took our dinners in our hands To loose no time in play The morn when first [we] went to school Who can forget the morn When the birchwhip lay upon the clock &amp; our hornbook it was torn We tore the little pictures out Less fond of books than play &amp; only took one letter home &amp; that the letter “A” I love in childhoods little book To read its lessons through &amp; oer each pictured page to look Because they read so true &amp; there my heart creates anew Love for each trifling thing —Who can disdain the meanest weed That shows its face at spring The daisey looks up in my face As long ago it smiled It knows no change but keeps its place &amp; takes me for a child The Chaffinch in the hedge row thorn Cries “pink pink pink” to hear My footsteps in the early morn As though a boy was near I seek no more the finches nest Nor stoop for daisey flowers I grow a stranger to myself In these delightful hours Yet when I hear the voice of spring I can but call to mind The pleasures which they used to bring The joys I used to find The firetail on the orchard wall Keeps at its startled cry Of “tweet tut tut” nor sees the morn Of boyhoods mischief bye It knows no change of changing time By sickness never stung It feeds on hopes eternal prime Around its brooded young Ponds where we played at “Duck &amp; Drake” Where the ash with ivy grew Where we robbed the Owl of all her eggs &amp; mocked her as she flew The broad tree in the spinney hedge Neath which the gipseys lay Where we our fine oak apples got On the twenty ninth of may These all remain as then they were &amp; are not changed a day &amp; the Ivys crowns as near to green As mine is to the grey It shades the pond oer hangs the stile &amp; the oak is in the glen But the paths of joy are so worn out I cant find one agen The merry wind still sings the song As if no change had been The birds build nests the summer long The trees look full as green As eer they did in childhoods joy Though that hath long been bye When I a happy roving boy In the fields had used to lye To tend the restless roving sheep Or lead the quiet cow Toils that seemed more than slavery then How more then freedom now Could we but feel as then we did When joy too fond to flye Would flutter round as soon as bid &amp; drive all troubles bye But rainbows on an april cloud &amp; blossoms pluckt in may &amp; painted eves that summer brings Fade not so fast away Tho grass is green though flowers are gay &amp; every where they be What are the leaves on branches hung Unto the withered tree Lifes happiest gifts &amp; what are they Pearls by the morning strung Which ere the noon are swept away— Short as a cuckoos song A nightingales the summer is Can pleasure make us proud To think when swallows fly away They leave her in her shroud Youth revels at his rising hour With more than summer joys &amp; rapture holds the fairey flower Which reason soon destroys O sweet the bliss which fancy feigns To hide the eyes of truth &amp; beautious still the charm remains Of faces loved in youth &amp; spring returns the blooming year Just as it used to be &amp; joys in youthful smiles appear To mock the change in me Each sight leaves memory ill at ease &amp; stirs an aching bosom To think that seasons sweet as these With me are out of blossom The fairest summer sinks in shade The sweetest blossom dies &amp; age finds every beauty fade That youth esteemed a prize The play breaks up the blossom fades &amp; childhood dissapears For higher dooms ambition aims &amp; care grows into years But time we often blame him wrong That rude destroying time &amp; follow him with sorrows song When he hath done no crime Our joys in youth are often sold In follys thoughtless fray &amp; many feel their hearts grow old Before their heads are grey The past—there lyes in that one word Joys more than wealth can crown Nor could a million call them back Though muses wrote them down The sweetest joys imagined yet The beautys that surpast All life or fancy ever met Are there among the past TO A POET Poet of mighty power I fain Would court the muse that honoured thee &amp; like Elishas spirit gain A part of thy intensity &amp; share the mantle which she flung Around thee when thy lyre was strung Though factions scorn at first did shun With coldness thy inspired song Though clouds of malice passed thy sun They could not hide it long Its brightness soon exaled away Dank night &amp; gained eternal day The critics wrath did darkly frown Upon thy muses mighty lay But blasts that break the blossom down Do only stir the bay &amp; thine shall flourish green &amp; long With the eternity of song Thy genius saw in quiet mood Gilt fashions follys pass thee bye &amp; like the monarch of the wood Towered oer it to the sky Where thou couldst sing of other spheres &amp; feel the fame of future years Though bitter sneers &amp; stinging scorns Did throng the muses dangerous way Thy powers were past such little thorns They gave thee no dismay The scoffers insult passed thee bye Thou smiled &amp; made him no reply Envy will gnaw its heart away To see thy genius gather root &amp; as its flowers their sweets display Scorns malice shall be mute Hornets that summer warmed to flye Shall at the death of summer die Though friendly praise hath but its hour &amp; little praise with thee hath been The bay may loose its summer flower But still its leaves are green &amp; thine whose buds are on the shoot Shall only fade to change to fruit Fame lives not in the breath of words In public praises hue &amp; cry The music of those summer birds Are silent in a winter sky When thine shall live &amp; flourish on Oer wrecks where crowds of fames are gone The ivy shuns the city wall Where busy clamorous crowds intrude &amp; climbs the desolated hall In silent solitude The time worn arch the fallen dome Are roots for its eternal home The bard his glory neer recieves Where summers common flowers are seen But winter finds it when she leaves The laurel only green &amp; time from that eternal tree Shall weave a wreath to honour thee A sunny wreath for poets meet From helicons immortal soil Where sacred time with pilgrim feet Walks forth to worship not to spoil A wreath which fame creates &amp; bears &amp; deathless genius only heirs Nought but thy ashes shall expire Thy genius at thy obsequies Shall kindle up its living fire &amp; light the muses skies Aye it shall rise &amp; shine &amp; be A sun in songs posterity AUTUMN Siren of sullen moods &amp; fading hues Yet haply not incapable of joy Sweet autumn I thee hail With welcome all unfeignd &amp; oft as morning from her lattice peeps To beckon up the sun I seek with thee To drink the dewy breath Of fields left fragrant then To solitudes where no frequented paths But what thine own feet makes betray thy home Stealing obtrusive there To meditate thine end By overshadowed ponds in woody nooks With ramping sallows lined &amp; crowding sedge Who woo the winds to play &amp; with them dance for joy &amp; meadow pools torn wide by lawless floods Where water lilies spread their oily leaves On which as wont the flye Oft battons in the sun Where leans the mossy willow half way oer On which the shepherd crawls astride to throw His angle clear of weeds That crowd the waters brim Or crispy hills &amp; hollows scant of sward Where step by step the patient lonely boy Hath cut rude flights of stairs To climb their steepy sides Then tracking at their feet grown hoarse with noise The crawling brook that ekes its weary speed &amp; struggles through the weeds With faint &amp; sullen brawls These haunts long favoured but the more as now With thee thus wandering moralizing on Stealing glad thoughts from grief &amp; happy though I sigh Sweet vision with the wild dishevelled hair &amp; raiments shadowy of each winds embrace Fain would I win thine harp To one accordant theme Now not inaptly craved communing thus Beneath the curdled arms of this stunt oak We'll pillow on the grass &amp; fondly ruminate Oer the disordered scenes of woods &amp; fields Ploughed lands thin travelled with half hungry sheep Pastures tracked deep with cows Where small birds seek for seeds Marking the cow boy that so merry trills His frequent unpremeditated song Wooing the winds to pause Till echo brawls again As on with plashy step &amp; clouted shoon He roves half indolent &amp; self employed To rob the little birds Of hips &amp; pendant awes &amp; sloes dim covered as with dewey veils &amp; rambling bramble berries pulp &amp; sweet Arching their prickly trails Half oer the narrow lane &amp; mark the hedger front with stubborn face The dank blea wind that whistles thinly bye His leathern garb thorn proof &amp; cheeks red hot with toil Wild sorceress me thy restless mood delights More than the stir of summers crowded scenes Where jostled in the din Joy pauled mine ear with song Heart sickening for the silence that is thine Not broken inharmoniously as now That lone &amp; vagrant bee Booms faint with weary chime &amp; filtering winds thin winnowing through the woods In tremelous noise that bids at every breath Some sickly cankered leaf Let go its hold &amp; die &amp; now the bickering storm with sudden start In flirting fits of anger carpeth loud Thee urging to thine end Sore wept by troubled skyes &amp; yet sublime in grief thy thoughts delight To show me visions of most gorgeous dyes Haply forgetting now They but prepare thy shroud Thy pencil dashing its excess of shades Improvident of waste till every bough Burns with thy mellow touch Disorderly divine Soon must I view thee as a pleasant dream Droop faintly &amp; so sicken for thine end As sad the winds sink low In dirges for their queen While in the moment of their weary pause To cheer thy bankrupt pomp the willing lark Starts from his shielding clod Snatching sweet scraps of song Thy life is waning now &amp; silence tries To mourn but meets no sympathy in sounds As stooping low she bends Forming with leaves thy grave To sleep inglorious there mid tangled woods Till parch lipped summer pines in draught away Then from thine ivied trance Awake to glories new ST MARTINS EVE Now that the year grows wearisome with age &amp; days grow short &amp; nights excessive long No outdoor sports the village hinds engage Still is the meadow romp &amp; harvest song That wont to echo from each merry throng At dinner hours beneath hugh spreading tree Rude winds hath done the landscape mickle wrong That nature in her mirth did ill foresee Who clingeth now to hope like shipwrecked folks at sea The woods are desolate of song—the sky Is all forsaken of its joyous crowd Martin &amp; swallow there no longer flye —Hugh seeming rocks &amp; deserts now enshroud The sky for aye with shadow shaping cloud None there of all those busy tribes remain No song is heard save one that wails aloud From the all lone &amp; melancholly crane Who like a traveller lost the right road seeks in vain The childern hastening in from threatening rain No longer round the fields for wild fruit run But at their homes from morn till night remain &amp; wish in vain to see the welcome sun Winters imprisonment is all begun Yet when the wind grows troubleous &amp; high Pining for freedom like a lovesick nun Around the gardens little bounds they flye Beneath the roaring trees fallen apples to espye But spite of all the melancholly moods That out of doors poor pleasures heart alarms Flood bellowing rivers &amp; wind roaring woods The fireside evening owns increasing charms What with the tale &amp; eldern wine that warms In purple bubbles by the blazing fire Of simple cots &amp; rude old fashioned farms They feel as blest as joys can well desire &amp; midnight often joins before the guests retire &amp; such a group on good St Martins eve Was met together upon pleasure bent Where tales &amp; fun did cares so well decieve That the old cottage rung with merriment &amp; even the very rafters groaned &amp; bent Not so much it would seem from tempests din That roared without in roaring discontent As from the merry noise &amp; laugh within That seemed as summers sports had never absent bin Beside the fire large apples lay to roast &amp; in a hugh brown pitcher creaming ale Was warming seasoned with a nutmeg toast The merry group of gossips to regale Around her feet the glad cat curled her tail Listening the crickets song with half shut eyes While in the chimney top loud roared the gale Its blustering howl of outdoor symphonies That round the cottage hearth bade happier moods arise &amp; circling round the fire the merry folks Brought up all sports their memory could devise Playing upon each other merry jokes &amp; now one shuts his hands &amp; archly cries Come open wide your mouth &amp; shut your eyes &amp; see what gifts are sent you—foolish thing He doth as he is bid &amp; quickly rise The peals of laughter when they up &amp; fling The ashes in while he goes spitting from the ring &amp; the old dame tho not in laughing luck For that same night at one fell sweeping stroke Mischieving cat that at a mouse had struck Upon the shelf her best blue china broke Yet spite of fate so funny was the joke She laughed untill her very sides did shake &amp; some so tittled were they could not smoke Laying down their pipes lest they their pipe should break &amp; laughed &amp; laughed again untill their ribs did ache Then deftly one with cunning in his eyes With out stretched hand walks backward in the dark Encouraged to the feet with proffered prize If so he right can touch pretended mark Made on the wall—&amp; happy as a lark He chuckles oer success by hopes prepared While one with open mouth like greedy shark Slives in the place &amp; bites his finger hard He bawls for freedom loud &amp; shames his whole reward Then came more games of wonderment &amp; fun Which set poor Hodges wisdom all aghast Who sought three knives to hide them one by one While one no conjuror to reveal the past Blindfold would tell him where he hid the last Hodge hiding two did for the third enquire All tittered round &amp; bade him hold it fast But ah he shook it from his hands in ire For while he hid the two they warmed it in the fire Then to appease him with his burning hand They bade him hide himself &amp; they would tell The very way in which he chose to stand Hodge thought the matter most impossible &amp; on his knees behind the mash tub fell &amp; muttering said I'll beat em now or never Crying out “how stand I” just to prove the spell They answered “like a fool” &amp; thing so clever Raised laughter against Hodge more long &amp; loud than ever Nor can the aged in such boisterous glee Escape the tricks for laugh &amp; jest designed The old dame takes the bellows on her knee &amp; puffs in vain to tricks of rougery blind Nor heeds the urgin who lets out the wind With crafty finger &amp; with cunning skill That for her life the cause she cannot find Untill the group unable to be still Laughs out &amp; dame though tricked smiles too against her will Yet mid this strife of joy—on corner stool One sits all silent doomed to worst of fate Who made one slip in love &amp; played the fool &amp; since condemned to live without a mate No youth again courts once beguiled Kate Tho hopes of sweethearts yet perplex her head &amp; charms to try by gipseys told of late Beneath her pillow lays an onion red To dream on this same night with whom she is to wed &amp; hopes that like to sunshine warming falls Being all the solace to her withering mind When they for dancing rise old young &amp; all She in her corner musing sits behind Her palid cheek upon her hand reclined Nursing rude melancholly like a child Who sighs its silence to the sobbing wind That in the chimney roars with fury wild While every other heart to joy is reconsiled One thumps the warming pan with merry glee That bright as is a mirror decks the cot Another droning as an humble bee Plays on the muffled comb till piping hot With over strained exertion—yet the lot Is such an happy one that still he plays Fatigue &amp; all its countless ills forgot All that he wants he wins—for rapture pays To his unwearied skill right earnest words of praise Ah happy hearts how happy cant be told To fancy music in such clamorous noise Like those converting all they touched to gold These all they hearken to convert to joys Thrice happy hearts—old men as wild as boys Feel nought of age creep oer their extacys —Old women whom no cares of life destroys Dance with the girls—true did the bard surmise “Where ignorance is bliss tis folly to be wise[”] When weary of the dance one reads a tale Tho puzzled oft to spell a lengthy word Storys though often read yet never stale But gaining interest every time theyre heard With morts of wonderment that neer occurred Yet simple souls their faith it knows no stint Things least to be believed are most preferred All counterfiets as from truths sacred mint Are readily believed if once put down in print Bluebeard &amp; all his murders dread parade Are listened to &amp; mourned for &amp; the tear Drops from the blue eye of the listening maid Warm as it fell upon her lovers bier None in the circle doubt of what they hear It were a sin to doubt oer tales so true So say the old whose wisdom all revere &amp; unto whom such reverence may be due For honest good intents praise that belongs to few &amp; Tib a Tinkers daughter is the tale That doth by wonder their rude hearts engage Oer young &amp; old its witchcraft scenes prevail In the rude legend of her pilgrimage How she in servitude did erst engage To live with an old hag of dreadful fame Who often fell in freaks of wonderous rage &amp; played with Tib full many a bitter game Till een the childern round cried out for very shame They read how once to thrash her into chaff The fearful witch tied Tibby in a sack &amp; hied her to the wood to seek a staff That might be strong enough her bones to whack But lucky Tib escaped ere she came back &amp; tied up dog &amp; cat her doom to share &amp; pots &amp; pans—&amp; loud the howl &amp; crack That rose when the old witch with inky hair Began the sack to thrash with no intent to spare &amp; when she found her unrevenged mistake Her rage more fearful grew but all in vain For fear no more caused Tibbys heart to ache She far away from the old hags domain Ran hartsomely a better place to gain &amp; here the younkers tongues grew wonder glib With gladness &amp; the reader stopt again Declaring all too true to be a fib &amp; urged full glasses round to drink success to Tib &amp; when her sorrows &amp; her pilgrimage The plot of most new novels &amp; old tales Grew to a close her beauty did presage Luck in the wind—&amp; fortune spread her sails In favouring bounty to Tibs summer gales All praised her beauty &amp; the lucky day At length its rosey smiling face unveils When Tib of course became a lady gay &amp; loud the listeners laughed while childern turned to play Anon the clock counts twelve &amp; mid their joys The startled blackbird smooths its feathers down That in its cage grew weary of their noise —The merry maiden &amp; the noisey clown Prepare for home &amp; down the straggling town To seek their cottages they tittering go Heartened with sports &amp; stout ale berry brown Beside their dames like chanticleer they crow While every lanthorn flings long gleams along the snow TO ? ON MAY MORNING Lady tis thy desire to move Far from the worlds ungentle throng Lady tis thy delight to love The muses &amp; the suns of song Nor taste alone is thine to praise For thou canst touch the minstrel wire &amp; while thourt praising others lays Wake notes that any may admire Forgive if I in friendships way Do offer thee a wreath of May I greet thee with no gaudy flowers For thou art not to fashions prone But rather lovest the woodland bowers Where natures beautys charm alone The Passion flower &amp; Ceres fine By wealth &amp; pride are reared alone Yet flowers more sweet nor less divine Springs humbler fields &amp; forests own To every hand &amp; bosom given And nourished by the dews of heaven The little violets bloom I weave In wreaths Im fain that thou shouldst prize Although it comes at winters eve &amp; often in the tempest dies The Primrose too a doubtful dream Of what precarious spring would be Yet would I not the type should seem Aught fancy feigns resembling thee &amp; thus belie thy gentle heart Where worldly coldness hath no part Here too are boughs of opening May And Lillies of the valley fair Yet not with idle praise to say Theyre types of what are sweet &amp; fair I cropt one from the pasture hedge The others from the forrest dell &amp; thou hast given the muses pledge Such scenes delight thy bosom well Tis not thy person wakes my lays Thy heart alone I mean to praise Forgive me though I flatter not Youths beauties it were thine to wear Hath been by riper years forgot Though thou hast had a happy share &amp; I might praise full many a grace That lives &amp; lingers yet behind But they like flowers shall change their place Not so the beauties of the mind So I have Ivy placed between To prove that worth is ever green The little blue Forget me not Comes too on friendships gentle plea Springs messenger in every spot Smiling on all remember me But gaudy Tulips find no place In garlands friendship would bestow Yet here the cowslip shows its face Prized for its sweetness more than show Emblems to pride &amp; pomp inclined Would but offend a modest mind I would not on Mays garland fling The Laurel to the muse &amp; thee For fashions praise—a common thing Hath made of that once sacred tree &amp; trust me many laurels wear That never grew on parnass hill Yet dare &amp; speed tis thine to heir The muses laurels if ye will Let flattery think her wreaths divine Merit by its own worth will shine O when I view the glorious host Of poets to my country born Though sorrow was the lot of most &amp; many shared the sneers of scorn That now by time &amp; talent tried Give life to fames eternal sun O when I mark the glorious pride That England from her bards hath won Een I the meanest of the throng Warm into extacy &amp; song The highest gifts each kingdom claims Are minstrels on the muses throne &amp; bards whove won the richest fames Tis Englands noblest pride to own Shakspears &amp; Miltons they that heir The fames immortal oer decay &amp; Scotts &amp; Byrons born to wear The honours of a later day That joins to present past renown &amp; sings eternity to crown These from proud laurels never won Their fames &amp; honours more divine They like the grand eternal sun Confer their glories where they shine The Laurel were a common bough Had it not decked the poets crown &amp; even weeds so common now Placed there would augur like renown Bloom satellites in glorys way Proud as the Laurel &amp; the Bay Lady &amp; thou hast chosen well To give the muses thy regard There taste from pleasure bears the bell There feeling finds its own reward Tho genius often while it makes Lifes millions happy with her songs For sorrows cup her portion takes &amp; struggles under bitterest wrongs To cares of life &amp; song unknown The poets fame be thine alone ON A CHILD KILLED BY LIGHTNING As fearless as a cherubs rest Now safe above the cloud A babe lay on its mothers breast When thunders roared aloud It started not to hear the crash But held its little hand Up at the lightnings fearful flash To catch the burning brand The tender mother held her breath In more than grief awhile To think the thing that brought its death Should cause her babe to smile Ay it did smile a heavenly smile To see the lightning play Well might she shriek when it turned pale &amp; yet it smiled in clay O woman the dread storm was given To be to each a friend It took thy infant pure to heaven Left thee impure to mend Thus providence will oft appear From Gods own mouth to preach Ah would we were as prone to hear As mercy is to teach THE AUTUMN ROBIN Sweet little bird in russet coat The livery of the closing year I love thy lonely plaintive note &amp; tiney whispering song to hear While on the stile or garden seat I sit to watch the falling leaves The songs thy little joys repeat My lonliness relieves &amp; many are the lonely minds That hear &amp; welcome thee anew Not taste alone but humble hinds Delight to praise &amp; love thee too The veriest clown biside his cart Turns from his song with many a smile To see thee from the hedgerow start To sing upon the stile The shepherd on the fallen tree Drops down to listen to thy lay &amp; chides his dog beside his knee Who barks &amp; frightens thee away The hedger pauses ere he knocks The stake down in the meadow gap —The boy who every songster mocks Forbears the gate to clap When in the hedge that hides the post Thy ruddy bosom he surveys Pleased with thy song in pleasure lost He pausing mutters scraps of praise The maiden marks at days decline Thee in the yard on broken plough &amp; stops her song to listen thine While milking brinded cow Thy simple faith in mans esteem From every heart hath favours won Dangers to thee no dangers seem Thou seemest to court them more than shun The clown in winter takes his gun The barn door flocking birds to slay Yet shouldst thou in the danger run He turns the tube away The gipsey boy who seeks in glee Blackberrys for a dainty meal Laughs loud on first beholding thee When called so near his presence steal He surely thinks thou knew the call &amp; though his hunger ill can spare The fruit he will not pluck them all But leaves some to thy share Upon the ditchers spade thoult hop For grubs &amp; wreathing worms to search Where woodmen in the forrests chop Thoult fearless on their faggots perch Nay by the gipseys camp I stop &amp; mark thee perch a moment there To prune thy wing awhile then drop The littered crumbs to share Domestic bird thy pleasant face Doth well thy common suit commend To meet thee in a stranger place Is meeting with an ancient friend I track the thickets glooms around &amp; there as loath to leave agen Thou comest as if thou knew the sound &amp; loved the sight of men The lonliest woods that man can trace To thee a pleasant dwelling gives In every town &amp; crowded place The sweet domestic Robin lives Go where we will in every spot Thy little welcome mates appear &amp; like the daiseys common lot Thourt met with every where The swallow in the chimney tier The tittering martin in the eaves With half of love &amp; half of fear Their mortared dwelling shyly weaves The sparrows in the thatch will shield Yet they as well as eer they can Contrive with doubtful faith to build Beyond the reach of man But thourt less timid than the wren Domestic &amp; confiding bird &amp; spots the nearest haunts of men Are oftenest for thy home preferred In garden walls thoult build so low Close where the bunch of fennel stands That een a child just learned to go May reach with tiney hands Sweet favoured bird thy under notes In summers music grows unknown The consert from a thousand throats Leaves thee as if to pipe alone No listening ear the shepheard lends The simple ploughman marks thee not &amp; then by all thy autumn friends Thourt missing &amp; forgot The far famed nightingale that heirs Cold public praise from every tongue The popular voice of music heirs &amp; injures much thy under song Yet then my walks thy theme salutes &amp; finds their autumn favoured guest Gay piping on the hazel roots Above thy mossy nest Tis wrong that thou shouldst be despised When these gay fickle birds appear They sing when summers flowers are prized Thou at the dull &amp; dying year Well let the heedless &amp; the gay Bepraise the voice of louder lays The joy thou stealest from sorrows day Is more to thee than praise &amp; could my notes win aught from thine My words but imitate thy lay Time would not then his charge resign Nor throw the meanest verse away But ever at this mellow time He should thy autumn praise prolong So would they share the happy prime Of thy eternal song ON THE MEMORY OF THE HONOURABLE LADY ? Lifes current journeyed smooth with thee &amp; travelled to eternity Calm &amp; untroubled as it ran When thy unruffled course began Wealth lulled thee on her golden breast But power neer stained thy princely rest Titles were thine &amp; not the pride That is with shadows dignified Thou knew how vain such things to trust &amp; felt earths honours were but dust While vain ambition joined the crowd While folly still pursued the proud &amp; pride blazed oer a titled name Thy meekness sought a better fame Unpleased with pomp unused to shine These own no claims to trumpet thine Patron to one—to all a friend Beloved &amp; honoured to thy end Not in the mockery flattery vents The marble tales of monuments Nor in the verse that only tells How much thy worth the theme excells But in the hearts of those that knew The blameless course thou didst pursue In prayers that want to heaven would send For even want could call thee friend Though fortune wrapt thy heart from care Yet pity found a dwelling there That thought oer troubles not its own &amp; felt for sorrows never known These are the farewells following thee To worths well won eternity &amp; thus thy memory lingers on Like sun beams when the day is gone They praised thee once with truths free will &amp; love to turn &amp; bless thee still Let pride to tinsel follys throng &amp; shine in flatterys birthday song Both are at best in their display The insects of a summers day While thine in many a heart shall live Till memory hath a thought to give Truth speaks thy fame &amp; while it mourns Thy end its gratitude returns Then rest while foes if foes can be Turn from thy cherished memory Envying when they cannot blame The blessing of an honest fame &amp; folly sighs at lifes decline For half the love that dwells with thine THE QUIET MIND Though [low] my lot my wish is won My hopes are few &amp; staid All I thought life would do is done The last request is made If I have foes no foes I fear To fate I live resigned I have a friend I value here &amp; thats a quiet mind I wish not it was mine to wear Flushed honours sunny crown I wish not I were fortunes heir She frowns &amp; let her frown I have no taste for pomp &amp; strife Which others love to find I only wish the bliss of life A poor &amp; quiet mind The trumpets taunt in battle field The great mans pedigree What peace can all their honours yield &amp; what are they to me Though praise &amp; pomp to eke the strife Rave like a mighty wind What are they to the calm of life A still &amp; quiet mind I mourn not that my lot is low I wish no higher state I sigh not that fate made me so Nor teaze her to be great I am content for well I see What all at last shall find That lifes worst lot the best shall be &amp; thats a quiet mind I see the great pass heedless bye &amp; pride above me tower It costs me not a single sigh For either wealth or power They are but men &amp; I'm a man Of quite as great a kind Proud too that life gives all she can A calm &amp; quiet mind I never mocked at beautys shrine To stain her lips with lyes No knighthoods fame or luck was mine To win loves richest prize &amp; yet I found in russet weed What all will wish to find True love &amp; comforts prize indeed A glad &amp; quiet mind &amp; come what will of cares or woe As some must come to all I'll wish not that they were not so Nor mourn that they befall If tears for sorrows start at will Theyre comforts in their kind &amp; I am blest if with me still Remains a quiet mind When friends depart as part they must &amp; loves true joys decay That leave us like the summers dust The wirlwind puffs away While lifes allotted time I brave Though left the last behind A prop &amp; friend I still shall have If Ive a quiet mind SHADOWS OF TASTE Taste with as many hues doth hearts engage As leaves &amp; flowers do upon natures page Not mind alone the instinctive mood declares But birds &amp; flowers &amp; insects are its heirs Taste is their joyous heritage &amp; they All choose for joy in a peculiar way Birds own it in the various spots they chuse Some live content in low grass gemmed with dews The yellowhammer like a tasteful guest Neath picturesque green molehills makes a nest Where oft the shepherd with unlearned ken Finds strange eggs scribbled as with ink &amp; pen He looks with wonder on the learned marks &amp; calls them in his memory writing larks Birds bolder winged on bushes love to be While some choose cradles on the highest tree There rocked by winds they feel no moods of fear But joy their birthright lives for ever near &amp; the bold eagle which mans fear enshrouds Would could he lodge it house upon the clouds While little wrens mistrusting none that come In each low hovel meet a sheltered home Flowers in the wisdom of creative choice Seem blest with feeling &amp; a silent voice Some on the barren roads delight to bloom &amp; others haunt the melancholly tomb Where death the blight of all finds summers hours Too kind to miss him with her host of flowers Some flourish in the sun &amp; some the shade Who almost in his morning smiles would fade These in leaf darkened woods right timid stray &amp; in its green night smile their lives away Others in water live &amp; scarcely seem To peep their little flowers above the stream While water lilies in their glories come &amp; spread green isles of beauty round their home All share the summers glory &amp; its good &amp; taste of joy in each peculiar mood Insects of varied taste in rapture share The heyday luxuries which she comes to heir In wild disorder various routs they run In water earth still shade &amp; busy sun &amp; in the crowd of green earths busy claims They een grow nameless mid their many names &amp; man that noble insect restless man Whose thoughts scale heaven in its mighty span Pours forth his living soul in many a shade &amp; taste runs riot in her every grade While the low herd mere savages subdued With nought of feeling or of taste imbued Pass over sweetest scenes a carless eye As blank as midnight in its deepest dye From these &amp; different far in rich degrees Minds spring as various as the leaves of trees To follow taste &amp; all her sweets explore &amp; Edens make where deserts spread before In poesys spells some all their raptures find &amp; revel in the melodies of mind There nature oer the soul her beauty flings In all the sweets &amp; essences of things A face of beauty in a city crowd Met—passed—&amp; vanished like a summer cloud In poesys vision more refined &amp; fair Taste reads oerjoyed &amp; greets her image there Dashes of sunshine &amp; a page of may Live there a whole life long one summers day A blossom in its witchery of bloom There gathered dwells in beauty &amp; perfume The singing bird the brook that laughs along There ceasless sing &amp; never thirsts for song A pleasing image to its page conferred In living character &amp; breathing word Becomes a landscape heard &amp; felt &amp; seen Sunshine &amp; shade one harmonizing green Where meads &amp; brooks &amp; forrests basking lie Lasting as truth &amp; the eternal sky Thus truth to nature as the true sublime Stands a mount atlas overpeering time Styles may with fashions vary—tawdry chaste Have had their votaries which each fancied taste From Donns old homely gold whose broken feet Jostles the readers patience from its seat To Popes smooth ryhmes that regularly play In musics stated periods all the way That starts &amp; closes starts again &amp; times Its tuning gammut true as minster chimes From these old fashions stranger metres flow Half prose half verse that stagger as they go One line starts smooth &amp; then for room perplext Elbows along &amp; knocks against the next &amp; half its neighbour where a pause marks time There the clause ends what follows is for ryhme Yet truth to nature will in all remain As grass in winter glorifies the plain &amp; over fashions foils rise proud &amp; high As lights bright fountain in a cloudy sky The man of sience in discoverys moods Roams oer the furze clad heath leaf buried woods &amp; by the simple brook in rapture finds Treasures that wake the laugh of vulgar hinds Who see no further in his dark employs Then village childern seeking after toys Their clownish hearts &amp; ever heedless eyes Find nought in nature they as wealth can prize With them self interest &amp; the thoughts of gain Are natures beautys all beside are vain But he the man of science &amp; of taste Sees wealth far richer in the worthless waste Where bits of lichen &amp; a sprig of moss Will all the raptures of his mind engross &amp; bright winged insects on the flowers of may Shine pearls too wealthy to be cast away His joys run riot mid each juicy blade Of grass where insects revel in the shade &amp; minds of different moods will oft condemn His taste as cruel such the deeds to them While he unconsious gibbets butterflyes &amp; strangles beetles all to make us wise Tastes rainbow visions own unnumbered hues &amp; every shade its sense of taste pursues The heedless mind may laugh the clown may stare They own no soul to look for pleasure there Their grosser feelings in a coarser dress Mock at the wisdom which they cant possess Some in recordless rapture love to breath Natures wild Eden wood &amp; field &amp; heath In common blades of grass his thoughts will raise A world of beauty to admire &amp; praise Untill his heart oerflows with swarms of thought To that great being who raised life from nought The common weed adds graces to his mind &amp; gleams in beautys few beside may find Associations sweet each object breeds &amp; fine ideas upon fancy feeds He loves not flowers because they shed perfumes Or butterflyes alone for painted plumes Or birds for singing although sweet it be But he doth love the wild &amp; meadow lea There hath the flower its dwelling place &amp; there The butterflye goes dancing through the air He loves each desolate neglected spot That seems in labours hurry left forgot The warped &amp; punished trunk of stunted oak Freed from its bonds but by the thunder stroke As crampt by straggling ribs of ivy sere There the glad bird makes home for half the year But take these several beings from their homes Each beautious thing a withered thought becomes Association fades &amp; like a dream They are but shadows of the things they seem Torn from their homes &amp; happiness they stand The poor dull captives of a foreign land Some spruce &amp; delicate ideas feed With them disorder is an ugly weed &amp; wood &amp; heath a wilderness of thorns Which gardeners shears nor fashions nor adorns No spots give pleasure so forlorn &amp; bare But gravel walks would work rich wonders there With such wild natures beautys run to waste &amp; arts strong impulse mars the truth of taste Such are the various moods that taste displays Surrounding wisdom in concentring rays Where threads of light from one bright focus run As days proud halo circles round the sun STANZAS ON A CHILD Times tide how swift its current flows &amp; mixed in every wave That on its farewell errand goes What pleasures find a grave The happiest day that ever is Is like a mourner gay For where lives one that cannot miss Some pleasure taen away Theres not a hid or secret rout That hope can take to joy But grief in time will find it out &amp; every hope destroy No no our sorrows grow extreme Our griefs are often vain When we in hopeless anguish seem A hope doth yet remain A few clouds gathered &amp; were oer A few cares troubled &amp; were bye &amp; now thourt on a happier shore To breath a milder sky Thy pains are oer then why engross The heart with thoughts of pain When all we vainly count as loss Proves thy eternal gain Death like a friend did come to thee As loath to make thee weep Thou knew him not thine enemy &amp; sunk as if to sleep So short thy life thy morning sun Seemed but to rise in vain Yet when it set—thy spirit won A joy unknown to pain &amp; thou art blest &amp; happy now Aye more thou little child Than even when thy sunny brow Saw summer flowers &amp; smiled For thou art in a golden sky Mid everlasting blooms Where suns neer set hopes never die &amp; trouble never comes A braided wreath—a golden crown Paint exits such as thine But vain to write such baubles down Where memory grows divine For low is fancys earthly eye That heavenly light asumes To think that mortal pagentry Immortal life illumes Crowns pearls &amp; all though splendid now With empty pride &amp; show Twere vain to think an angels brow Wears aught from pomps below No matter hopes are recconsiled Thy little heads at rest Deaths angel read thy name &amp; smiled To find thee with the blest TO THE MEMORY OF AN ADMIRAL Departed shade of lofty birth Though proud &amp; high thy pedigree Thou wert the poor mans friend on earth For thou wert one to me &amp; shall no tender chord be strung No plaintive strain to honour thee &amp; shall no honest lay be sung To grace thy memory Though humble be the power I claim Though mean &amp; poor my dittys be I care not though the muse I shame To show my love to thee The mourning that thy bier bedewed The feeling that attends the brave The “still small voice” of gratitude Were all that blest thy grave When great men die their deeds of fame Around their scutcheoned hearse are hung &amp; thou wert great in birth &amp; name Yet not a lyre was strung When heroes vanish honours breath Bids fame their loud sung deeds reward A heroe thou yet at thy death Not een a dirge was heard When good men go the muses skill Wreaths memorys musings round the spot &amp; thou wert good though all were still As if they knew thee not &amp; this poor theme that fain would bloom Around the memory of the brave Is all that wreaths a warriors tomb &amp; shrouds a good mans grave &amp; worth shall live when themes decay Far brighter themes than mine When earthly splendours pass away The good mans deeds shall shine DEATH Why should mans high aspiring mind Burn in him with so proud a breath When all his haughty views can find In this world yields to death The fair the brave the vain the wise The rich the poor &amp; great &amp; small Are each but worms anatomys To strew his quiet hall Power may make many earthly gods Where gold &amp; briberys guilt prevails But deaths unwelcome honest odds Kicks oer the unequal scales The flattered great may clamours raise Of power &amp; their own weakness hide But death shall find unlooked for ways To end the farce of pride An arrow hurtled eer so high From een a jiants sinewy strength In times untraced eternity Goes but a pigmy length Nay whirring from the tortured string With all its pomp of hurried flight Tis by the skylarks little wing Out measured in its height Just so mans boasted strength &amp; power Shall fade before deaths lightest stroke Laid lower than the meanest flower Whose pride oertopt the oak &amp; he who like a blighting blast Dispeopled worlds with wars alarms Shall be himself destroyed at last By poor despised worms Tyrants in vain their powers secure &amp; awe slaves murmurs with a frown But unawed death at last is sure To rap the babels down A stone thrown upward to the sky Will quickly meet the ground agen So men gods of earths vanity Shall drop at last to men &amp; power &amp; pomp their all resign Blood purchased thrones &amp; banquet halls Fate waits to sack ambitions shrine As bare as prison walls Where the poor suffering wretch bows down To laws a lawless power hath past &amp; pride &amp; power &amp; king &amp; clown Shall be deaths slaves at last Time the prime minister of death Theres nought can bribe his honest will He stops the richest tyrants breath &amp; lays his mischief still Each wicked scheme for power all stops With grandeurs false &amp; mock display As eves shades from high mountain tops Fade with the rest away Death levels all things in his march Nought can resist his mighty strength The pallace proud triumphal arch Shall mete their shadows length The rich the poor one common bed Shall find in the unhonoured grave Where weeds shall crown alike the head Of tyrant &amp; of slave FAREWELL TO LOVE Love &amp; thy vain employs away From this too oft deluded breast No longer will I court thy stay To be my bosoms teazing guest Thou treacherous medicine reckoned pure Thou quackery of the harrassed heart That kills what thou pretendst to cure Life mountebank thou art With nostrum vain of boasted powers That taen a worse disorder breeds An asp hid in a group of flowers That kills &amp; slays when none percieves Thou mock truce to the troubled mind Leading it on in sorrows way Freedom that leaves us more confined I bid thee hence away Dost taunt &amp; deem my power beyond The resolution reason gave Tut—falsity hath snapt each bond That made me once thy quiet slave &amp; made thy snares a spiders threads Which een my breath can break in twain Nor will I be like Sampson led To trust thy wiles again I took thee as my staff to guide Me on the road I did pursue &amp; when my weakness most relied Upon its strength it broke in two I took thee as my friendly host That council might in dangers show But when I needed thee the most I found thou wert my foe So go thou folly painted toy Thou plaything all display I will at least outbrave the boy &amp; throw such idle toys away Thou dream for follys idle hour Which I have found a dream indeed Thou distant seeming showey flower That proves when near a weed Go trump thy mystic lotterys Elsewere—veiled neath deceptions blot Holding out every draw a prize Where worthless blanks are only got &amp; flourish with thy patron dame Yclipt a goddess &amp; her boy That fills the world with empty fame &amp; lives in painted joy Tempt me no more with rosey cheeks Nor daze my reason with bright eyes Im wearied with thy painted freaks &amp; sicken at such vanitys Be roseys fine as eer they will They with the meanest fade &amp; dye &amp; eyes though thronged with darts to kill Are doomed to like mortality Feed the young bard that madly sips His nectar draughts from follys flowers Bright eyes fair cheeks &amp; ruby lips Till muses melt to honey showers Lure him to thrum thy empty lays While flattery listens to the chimes Till words themselves grow sick with praise &amp; stops for want of ryhmes Let such be still thy paramours &amp; chaunt loves old &amp; idle tune Robbing the spring of all her flowers &amp; heaven of its stars &amp; moon To guild with dazzling similies Blind follys vain &amp; empty lay Im sobered from such phantacys So get thee hence away Nor bid me sigh for mine own cost Nor count it loss for mine anoy Nor say my stubbornness hath lost A paradise of dainty joy I'll not believe thee till I know That sober reason turns an ape Or acts the harlequin to show That cares in every shape Heart aching sighs &amp; grief wrung tears Shame blushes at betrayed distress Dissembled smiles &amp; jealous fears Are nought but real happiness Then will I mourn what now I brave &amp; suffer Celias quirks to be Like a poor fate bewildered slave The rulers of my destiny I'll weep &amp; sigh when eer she wills To frown—&amp; when she deigns to smile It shall be cure for all my ills &amp; foolish still I'll laugh the while But till that comes I'll bless the rules Experience taught &amp; deem it wise To hold thee as the game of fools &amp; all thy tricks despise THE VILLAGE DOCTRESS “Bold to prescribe &amp; busy to apply” Garth The Hut that stands in unpretending pride With mossy thatch the meanest in the street &amp; smoke stained chimney far afield descried Where swallows come springs dewy morn to meet &amp; in its shelter find a snug retreat Plain shed yet they that in its shelter dwell A portion of lifes joys neer fail to meet Though [cares] full thick &amp; often round them fell Full pleasant are the tales their chronicles can tell Calm industry though scantily supplied Toils with content &amp; smiles at idle fears Warm providence their deity &amp; guide Trims hopes sweet bark to stem the sea of years That life spreads onward—beautiful appears The seeming smiles of comforts painted sky Though neer attained faith still witholds its tears &amp; cheers them onward with unwearied eye Still hoping better luck when e'er the worst is bye Here dwells the village doctress one that owns The praise of half the village for her powers In curing every ill save broken bones With famous drinks &amp; ointments made of flowers Sought for &amp; gathered in propitious hours When the fast waxing moon with thrifty speed Outgrows her slender horns &amp; dewy showers Quickens the earth &amp; fattens every weed &amp; thus her skill for cures grows marvelous indeed Charms for the ague wrapt with mystic care From the too curious eye of prying wight That shivering patients in their bosoms wear For many a hopeful day &amp; restless night Untill at last with wondersome delight They miss the shivering fit &amp; pleased confess The wonder working charm hath acted right &amp; grant her mickle fame for such success &amp; think her deeply skilled &amp; who can fancy less Thus famed she is for miles the village round Though not the noisey travelled far &amp; near That water doctors gain from ways profound Who sound without detection shaming fear Quackerys loud trump in superstitions ear She is contented with an humble claim &amp; thus her modest worth to all is dear Strange is it thus to think that dainty fame Should stoop at humble cots to notice such a dame Culpeppers Herbal dark star reading wight She as an helpmate to her skill possest &amp; Westleys Phisic which all dames delight To read who fancy simple things the best There in a corner cupboard she possest Locked up for safetys sake as wisdom rare From meddling child with mischief in its breast Who as she turned her back might climb a chair &amp; pull the shelf books down a picture out to tear Yet from the doctors stars she nought could learn Puzzles indeed one easy might suppose For wiser heads then grannys to discern Yet fain their mighty mysterys to disclose She often placed her glasses on her nose To pore in study deep &amp; earnest heed Letting a hole grow bigger in her clothes Neglecting toil his dark consciets to read &amp; when she'd racked her brains she rose sore vexed indeed Yet though so ignorant in signs &amp; lures That skill of conjuring quack so well commends She with poor people did such morts of cures That in their eyes &amp; such like partial friends Phisic seemed oozing from her finger ends They nothing know of learnings pomp not they That makes so great a mystery—she attends Prescribes &amp; plasters—all for little pay Thus fame &amp; patients too increase with every day Each broken teacup she preserves with care &amp; morts of things that on her shelf abound Bottles that do their former uses wear “Daffeys” &amp; “Godfreys Cordial” labeled round Employed for drugs &amp; uses less renowned To hold unlabeled water for the eye &amp; oyster shells picked off the fallow ground To hold the salve which woodmen come to buy As oft their dangerous toils are needing fresh supply &amp; oft to hunt her herbs she hies abroad Where she would meet birdnesting boys at play Strewing the mossy nests about the road &amp; bearing in their hats the eggs away She'd preach like parson oer their sinful play &amp; if they laughed her pitying plaints to hear She'd shake her stick &amp; threaten sore dismay To make their rebel deeds grow kind in fear For she in pitys cause was advocate severe She had a tender heart as eer could be &amp; for live things aye she'd a love for all She would not let the childern kill a bee With beating hats beside her cottage wall &amp; if a spider in her cot did crawl She'd take her brush &amp; sweep it to the door &amp; een when beetles neath her foot did fall As bustling oer the footpath or the floor It cost her many a sigh &amp; grieved her heart full sore That whasp that in her window light trepanned Buzzes for pitys sake nor calls in vain She instant wraps her apron round her hand &amp; guides the adventurer to the broken pane To greet its freedom &amp; its friends again Nor living thing that ever flies or crawls Hath reason of her malice to complain Save felon mouse that mercys boon forestalls &amp; in the baited trap for nightly plunder falls The herbs most famous in her skills esteem Were such as herbal books the most commend Herbs that in common eyes do only seem As common weeds unskilled to comprehend The virtues wisdom in their praise has penned &amp; but for her &amp; such as her they'd grow Their little lives away without a friend One passing glance of notice to bestow As when they come in bloom or out of bloom they go Famed earthern tongue that sprouts on april baulks &amp; Mallows horseshoe leaves by every wall &amp; inner bark scraped from young eldern stalks Of these she makes an ointment fit for all Green wounds that eer to poor mans lot befall &amp; wormwood tufts that thrive in many a town &amp; stinking seeding burdock spreading tall That plagues the maiden in her sunday gown These in her matchless skill grew weeds of high renown &amp; self heal flowering in a russet husk &amp; scurvy grass that pursy grannys prize With dwarf heath mallows smelling faint of musk Bogbean too shining in its mozzly dyes Brooklime that on the shallow water lies With famous eyebrights slightly penciled flowers Infallable for weak short sighted eyes These strange to schoolboys in flower seeking hours Who think them worthless all to her own mighty powers Tormentil also with its yellow bloom Thriving on wild uncultivated land &amp; creeping five leaved grass that maketh room In every spot its tendrills to expand These would she gather with right careful hand &amp; hang them up to dry in many a row For drinks &amp; teas &amp; uses rightly scanned &amp; more she sought whose fames I must forego Or my unlearned ryhmes will bulky herbals grow In sooth she is an all accomplished dame Not learned in herbs alone but all compact In useful skill not taking note of fame She turns her hand to every thing in fact &amp; though some errors now &amp; then detract Some little from the much she seems to know Her knowledge doth full many brains distract That of her thrift &amp; fame right jealous grow &amp; struggles all how vain in the same steps to go Bees much her head to study did invite &amp; with her musing hours doth well agree It bringeth all both profit &amp; delight To study knowledge of the honey bee &amp; she by certain signs few else could see Knew when they were in liklihood to swarm From certain sounds that in the hive would be For even to such signs she could conform As if those sounds were words &amp; language uniform When round the hives in May they thickening flye She seeks her new made hives to dress them well With balm &amp; hairy fennel scented high That grow in monstrous bunches by the well Mysterious problems of some learned spell To make them in their new abode remain &amp; warming pan half loud as village bell She rings their roving ears to entertain As though they loved the sound nor rings she oft in vain &amp; when they swarm on plumb or eldern tree She'll take them in the hive with naked hand Not frit to bear the sting of rebel bee Harmless as flies as if by choice trepanned Or by her spells subjected to command They spin about her ears on harmless wing &amp; though she close about their hives will stand For hours on sabbath mornings in the spring To watch them at their toil none ever shows his sting Yet she did reverence to the sunday pay &amp; set her brush &amp; mop behind the door &amp; all her dirty things &amp; wheel away Putting her house to rights the day before Of labour she would dare to do no more When sunday came—yet shes so passing clean Folks vow they een could eat upon the floor Which not one time in ten was ever seen Unswept or grit the while to fill the bricks atween She neer missed going to church or foul or fair Loath as she is her good red cloak to spoil She seeks her ancient prayerbook wrapt with care In cotton covers lest her hands should soil The gilded back full loath is she to spoil A book of which her parents took such heed For it hath grown in memorys sacred soil An old esteem from sire to son decreed &amp; to ill use such book were sacrilidge indeed &amp; if she failed to hear the chiming bell As much her hearing failed her—at the door She'll watch some neighbour her mishap to tell &amp; sigh &amp; undergo temptations sore Thinking that God will heed her prayers no more Thus to neglect her duty—yet the while She'll read the prayers &amp; good church lessons oer Or “Bunyans Pilgrim” errors to beguile &amp; thus oer godly books her fears will recconsile Two jobs there are which she feels bound to do What ever rest the sabbath may require &amp; on a working day she'll cease to sew &amp; close her book how eer she may admire The passage she is reading or desire To finish—she must turn the leaf adown &amp; pull her glasses off to stir the fire &amp; turn her hour glass up in case of brown Worm eat by heedless age &amp; praised by many a clown In wicker cage placed in the lilac bush That hides the cottage door with flowers in may Loud sings &amp; long hath sung a merry thrush Hung constant there to share the sunny day Strangers oft turn to listen to the lay &amp; village boys full often &amp; full long Forgo their errands by that spot to play While bawling mothers scold that thrushes song &amp; with unfeeling ears the powers of music wrong A magpie too as tame as dunghill cock Strays where it will &amp; where it lists will flye &amp; every human voice it hears will mock Sing whistle talk &amp; mimic laugh &amp; cry &amp; should some merry maid go dancing bye Like wicked clown it will her worth defame Holes in her stocking heels soon meets his eye &amp; fast he follows while she runs in shame Calling her naughty names my ryhmes are loath to name &amp; she has bantum fowls few else will prize Muffled with feathers to the very toe Scarce bigger than a partridge in their size To whom a dish of corn she'll daily throw &amp; proud the cock will stretch his wings &amp; crow Beside his dames—though sparrows on the tree That overhang the well will let him know They think their little selves as good as he &amp; peck the corn with him &amp; see no fear to flee &amp; more of curious things to note &amp; heed The tasteful eye about her cot may see That would be deemed right curious all indeed Had Dr Solomon or such as he Been born the tennant of her cot to be Yet she as worthy honours neer procures From colledge grants diploma or degree While some thats gained them shameful sight endures To see their drugs less prized &amp; notified for cures &amp; when she dies no doubt fames latent spark Will light up epitaph her powers to tell &amp; warm the muse of worthy parish clerk To chime a stanza while he chimes the bell &amp; unto all the world her praises tell If all the world would read her humble stone For twere a burning shame &amp; sin as well That one who hath such cures &amp; wonders shown Should leave the world for aye &amp; be for aye unknown STANZAS [Though lifes rude floods with sudden roar] Though lifes rude floods with sudden roar Drifts me on seas without a shore While Gods my hope &amp; anchor I Can find a quiet place to lie Mans heart may ache mans spirit fear But thou my God when thou art near I doubted once—I know it now Thy smiles can cheer the saddest brow Anoyed by envys bitter gibes Beset with troubles evil tribes I called on God he heard the call &amp; proved a friendship all in all THE ANNIVERSARY TO A FLOWER OF THE DESERT March wakened in wildness Or musing in glee Thy tempest or sunshine Is welcome to me I found on thy bosom A treasure of spring A fairer &amp; dearer Than summer could bring Ere the throstle had ventured A song to the morn Or the blackbird to build him A nest in the thorn On the wild hills of walkerd All withered &amp; bare Had Eden existed I had thought it was there Hope long had been blighted Love lingered in chains Faith long had been plighted To scorn &amp; disdains The road it was weary That led me along With no thought to cheer me But the sorrows of song I looked to the east twas A sunrise in shrouds I looked to the west there Was nothing but clouds In aching &amp; sorrow Hope lost her employ She had grief for the morrow But no day for joy Here a sun burst a cloud where I looked for a shower Here a spot that seemed desert Discovered a flower Endowed in youths glory Both blossom &amp; stem Was the model of beauty &amp; I worshiped the gem For my heart it was neuter To form &amp; disguise Nor like a freebooter I looked on the prize But with heart that felt friendless &amp; wanted a friend On a way that seemed endless &amp; now met an end I loved it &amp; proved it &amp; down to this hour I neer saw the beauty I found in that flower Summer lived in its blossom Though winter was bye Joy laughed in its bosom Though sorrow was nigh A pallace without it A prison would be &amp; the cottage that owned it Was a pallace to me My heart it was weary I sued as a guest Love was all that could cheer me &amp; there I had rest Twas the hope most bewitching That beauty inspired Twas the joy most enriching That fancy admired Twas the bloom of lifes fancys To garland my brow &amp; though sick of romances Tis my bosoms home now A MORNING WALK Ah sure it is a lovely day As ever summers glory yields &amp; I will put my books away &amp; wander in the fields Just risen is the red round sun Cocks from the roost doth loudly bawl &amp; house bee busily begun Hums round the mortered wall &amp; while I take my staff to start Birds sing among the eldern leaves &amp; fighting sparrows glad at heart Chirp in the cottage eaves Nor can I help but turn &amp; view Ere yet I close the creaking door The sunbeams eager peeping through Upon the sanded floor The twilight streaks of lightsome grey Hath from the eastern summit gone &amp; clouds cloathed in the pride of day Put golden liverys on The creeping sun large round &amp; red Yet higher hastens up &amp; higher Till blazing oer its cloudy bed It shines a ball of fire Cows now their morning meals pursue The carthorse to its labour's sped &amp; sheep shake off the nightly dew Just risen from their bed Tha maids are out &amp; many a smile Are left them by the passing swain Who as they lightly skip the stile Will turn &amp; smile again All nightly things are on the rout By daylights burning smiles betrayed &amp; gnats retreating from the sun Fly dancing to the shade The snail is stealing from the light Where grass a welcome shelter weaves &amp; white moths shrink in cool delight Behind the bowering leaves The hares their fearful morsels eat Till by a snufling dog descried Then hastening to their snug retreat They waited eventide The rabbit bustled out of sight Nor longer cropt each thymy hill But seeks his den where gloomy night Is kept imprisoned still The walks that sweetest pleasure yields When things appear so fresh &amp; fair Are when we wander round the fields To breath the morning air The fields like spring seem young &amp; gay The dewy trees &amp; painted sky &amp; larks as sweetly as in May Still whistle as they fly The woods that oft my steps recieves I cannot search for resting bowers For when I touch the sleepy leaves Dews patter down in showers But I can range the green &amp; share The charms the pasture scene displays Crooking down sheep tracks here &amp; there That lead a thousand ways Bowing dewdropping by the stream The flowers glow lively on the sight Awaking from nights summer dream As conscious of delight Nor could I crop them in such hours Without regret that I'd destroyed A joy in my companion flowers As sweet as I enjoyed The stinking finweeds blushing bloom Their pea like flowers appear so fair That bees will to their bosoms come &amp; hope for honey there For bumble bees ere flowers are dry Will wake &amp; brush the trembling dew &amp; drone as mellancholy bye When dreams are proved untrue While waving rushbeds winding through I idly swing my staff about To free their tasseled tops from dew The leveret startles out &amp; now the lark starts from its nest But not to sing—on thistle nigh It perks in fear &amp; prunes its breast Till I have journeyed bye The resting cow just turns its head To stare then chews its cud again The colt more timid leaves its bed &amp; shakes its shaggy main The shoy sheep flye &amp; faster still The wet grass smoaking neath their flight When shepherds urged their whistles shrill &amp; dogs appear in sight Still there is joy that will not cease Calm hovering oer the face of things That sweet tranquility &amp; peace That morning ever brings The shadows by the sun portrayed Lye basking in the golden light Een little hillocks stretch their shade As if they loved the sight The brook seemed purling sweeter bye As freshened from the cooling light &amp; on its breast the morning sky Smiles beautiful &amp; bright The pools still depth as night was bye Warmed as to life in curling rings Stirred by the touch of water flye Or zephers gentle wings &amp; cows did on its margin lie As blest as morn would never cease &amp; knapping horse grazed slowly bye That added to its peace No flies disturbed the herding boys Save flies the summer water breeds That harmless shared the morning joys &amp; hummed among the weeds Birds fluttered round the waters brink Then perched their dabbled wings to dry &amp; swallows often stooped to drink &amp; twittered gladly bye &amp; on the brook banks rushy ridge Larks sat the morning sun to share &amp; doves where ivy hides the bridge Sing soothing dittys there The leaves of ash &amp; elms &amp; willows That skirt the pastures wildered way Heaved to the breeze in gentle billows Of mingled green &amp; grey —The birds the breeze—the milkers call The brook that in the sun did glisten Told morns delight that smiled on all As one that loves to listen O who can shun the lovely morning The calms the crowds of beautious things O wheres the soul that treats with scorning The beauty morning brings With dewdrops braided round her hair &amp; opening flowers her breast adorning O wheres the soul that cannot share The lovliness of morning By hedgerow side &amp; field &amp; brook I love to be its partner still To turn each leaf of natures book Where all may read as will &amp; he who loves it not destroys His quiet &amp; makes life a slave His soul is dead to loves &amp; joys His own heart is their grave The very boys appear to share The joy of mornings lovely hours In rapture running here &amp; there To stick their hats with flowers Some loll them by a resting stile To listen pleasing things around Dove lark &amp; bee &amp; try the while To imitate the sound The shepherd muses oer his hook &amp; quiet as the morning seems Or reads some wild mysterious book On “fortunes moles &amp; dreams” While by his side as blest as he His dog in peaceful slumber lies Unwakened as he used to be To watch the teazing flies Rapt in delight I long have stood Gazing on scenes that seem to smile &amp; now to view far field &amp; wood I climb this battered stile There sails the puddock still &amp; proud Assailed at first by swopping crows But soon it meets the morning cloud &amp; scorns such humble foes The mist that round the distance bent By woodland side &amp; slopeing hill Fled as each minute came &amp; went More far &amp; further still &amp; the blue tinge which night renewed Round the horisons fairey way More faster than the eye pursued Shrank unpercieved away By leaning trees beneath the swail For pleasing things I love to look Or loll oer oak brigs guarding rail That strideth oer the brook To mark above the willow row The painted windmills peeping sails Seeming in its journey slow Pleased with the easy gentle gales &amp; oft I sit me on the ground Musing upon a neighbouring flower Or watch the church clocks humming sound To count the passing hour Or mark the brook its journey take In gentle curves round many a weed Or hear the soft wind first awake Among the rustling reed TO P???? Fair was thy bloom when first I met Thy summers maiden blossom &amp; thou art fair &amp; lovely yet &amp; dearer to my bosom O thou wast once a wildling flower All garden flowers excelling &amp; still I bless the happy hour That led me to thy dwelling Though nursed by field &amp; brook &amp; wood &amp; wild in every feature Spring neer unsealed a fairer bud Nor formed a blossom sweeter &amp; of all flowers the spring has met &amp; it has met with many Thou art to me the fairest yet &amp; lovliest of any Though ripening summers round thee bring Buds to thy swelling bosom That wait the cheering smiles of spring To ripen into blossom These buds shall added blessings be To make our love sincerer For as their flowers resemble thee Theyll make thy memory dearer &amp; though thy bloom shall pass away By winter overtaken Thoughts of the past will charms display &amp; many joys awaken When time shall every sweet remove &amp; blight thee on my bosom Let beauty fade—to me &amp; love Thoult neer be out of blossom EMMONSALES HEATH In thy wild garb of other times I find thee lingering still Furze oer each lazy summit climbs At natures easy will Grasses that never knew a scythe Waves all the summer long &amp; wild weed blossoms waken blythe That ploughshares never wrong Stern industry with stubborn pride &amp; wants unsatisfied Still leaves untouched thy maiden soil In its unsullied pride The birds still find their summer shade To build their nests agen &amp; the poor hare its rushy glade To hide from savage men Nature its family protects In thy security &amp; blooms that love what man neglects Find peaceful homes in thee The wild rose scents thy summer air &amp; woodbines weave in bowers To glad the swain sojourning there &amp; maidens gathering flowers Creations steps ones wandering meets Untouched by those of man Things seem the same in such retreats As when the world began Furze ling &amp; brake all mingling free &amp; grass forever green All seem the same old things to be As they have ever been The brook oer such neglected ground Ones weariness to sooth Still wildly threads its lawless bounds &amp; chafes the pebble smooth Crooked &amp; rude as when at first Its waters learned to stray &amp; from their mossy fountain birst It washed itself a way O who can pass such lovely spots Without a wish to stray &amp; leave lifes cares a while forgot To muse an hour away Ive often met with places rude Nor failed their sweet to share But passed an hour with solitude &amp; left my blessing there He that can meet the morning wind &amp; oer such places roam Nor leave a lingering wish behind To make their peace his home His heart is dead to quiet hours No love his mind employs Poesy with him neer shares its flowers Nor solitude its joys O there are spots amid thy bowers Which nature loves to find Where spring drops round her earliest flowers Uncheckt by winters wind Where cowslips wake the childs supprise Sweet peeping ere their time Ere april spreads her dappled skyes Mid mornings powdered rime Ive stretched my boyish walks to thee When maydays paths were dry When leaves had nearly hid each tree &amp; grass greened ancle high &amp; mused the sunny hours away &amp; thought of little things That childern mutter oer their play When fancy trys its wings Joy nursed me in her happy moods &amp; all lifes little crowd That haunt the waters fields &amp; woods Would sing their joys aloud I thought how kind that mighty power Must in his splendour be Who spread around my boyish hour Such gleams of harmony Who did with joyous rapture fill The low as well as high &amp; made the pismires round the hill Seem full as blest as I Hopes sun is seen of every eye The haloo that it gives In natures wide &amp; common sky Cheers every thing that lives HYMN TO SPRING Thou virgin bliss the seasons bring Thou yet beloved in vain I long to hail thee gentle spring &amp; meet thy face again That rose bud cheek that [sun] lit eye Those locks of fairest hue Which zephers wave each minute bye &amp; show thy smiles anew O how I wait thy reign begun To gladden earth &amp; skys When threatened with a warmer sun The sullen winter flies When songs are sung from every tree When bushes bud to bowers When plains a carpet spread for thee &amp; strew thy way with flowers Ah I do long that day to see When neer a fountain side I loiter hours away with thee With beauty gratified To look upon those eyes of blue Whose light is of the sky &amp; that unearthly face to view Which love might deify I long to press that glowing breast Whose softness might suffice A pillow for an angels rest &amp; still be paradise &amp; o I wait those smiles to see To me to nature given Smiles stolen from joys eternity When mortals taste of heaven O urge the surley winter bye Nor let him longer live Whose suns creep shyly down the sky &amp; grudge the light they give O bring thy suns &amp; brighter days Which lover like delight To hasten on their morning ways &amp; loath retire at night O hasten on thou lovely spring Bid winter frown in vain Thy mantle oer thy shoulders fling &amp; choose an early reign Thy herald flower in many a place The daisey joins with me While chill winds nip his crimpled face He smiles in hopes of thee Then come &amp; while my heart is warm To sing thy pleasures new Led onward by thy lovely arm I'll high me through the dew Or meet thy noondays sober wind Thy rearing flowers to see &amp; weave a wreath of those I find To nature &amp; to thee VALENTINE TO MARY This visionary theme is thine From one who loves thee still Tis writ to thee a Valentine But call it what you will No more as wont thy beaming eye To violets I compare Nor talk about the lilys dye To tell thee thou art fair The time is past when hopes sweet will First linked thy name with mine &amp; the fond muse with simple skill Chose thee its Valentine Though some may yet their powers employ To wreath with flowers thy brow With me thy loves a withered joy With hope thourt nothing now The all that youths fond spring esteems Its blossoms pluckt in May Are gone like flowers in summer dreams &amp; thoughts of yesterday The heavenly dreams of early love Youths spell has broken there &amp; left the aching heart to prove That earth owns nought so fair Spring flowers were fitting hopes young songs To grace loves earliest vow But withered ones that autumn wrongs Are emblems meetest now Their perished blooms that once were green Hopes faded tale can tell Of shadows were a sun hath been &amp; suits its memory well Then why should I on such a day Address a song to thee When withered hope hath died away &amp; love no more can be When blinded fate that still destroys Hath rendered all as vain &amp; parted from the bosom joys Twill never meet again The substance of our joys hath been Their flowers have faded long But memory keeps the shadow green &amp; wakes this idle song Then let esteem a welcome prove That can t its place resign &amp; friendship take the place of love To send a valentine VERSES [Tho winter comes dreary] Tho winter comes dreary In frost &amp; in snow A sun shall come cheery &amp; bid them all go The spring it shall greet with Its songs &amp; its showers The summer shall meet with Its dancing &amp; flowers But alas for the lover Thats loved not again No art can discover A cure for the pain Full dark is the token Of pleasures adieu The heart that is broken No hopes can renew The star falls in darkness To be no more seen &amp; leaves a blank markless Where splendour hath been On the shore speedy dying Noughts seen of the wave So the heart for love dying Sinks into the grave THE HOLIDAY WALK Come Eliza &amp; Anna lay bye top &amp; ball &amp; Freddy boy throw away cart &amp; toys all Look about for your hats &amp; dispence with your play We'll seek for the fields &amp; be happy to day Do but hark at the shouts of the boys by the school As noisey &amp; merry as geese in a pool While the master himself is so sick of his thrall That he laughs like the merriest child of them all While they race with their shadows he joins in the fray &amp; leaps oer the “cat gallows” nimble as they As glad to get out of his school in the sun As a captive would be from his prison to run The morning invites us to walk come along Tis so sweet that the sparrow een tries at a song The dews are all gone save amid the dark glooms Neath the woods crowded leaves were the sun never comes Nor need we regret that the dews linger there For brambles defye us to come if we dare &amp; doubtless each poor little bird in the end Is glad to consider the bramble its friend For girls even often its dwelling destroys &amp; boys are so cruel birds cannot like boys So we'll be contented to roam far away Through bean fields in blossom &amp; closes of hay Do but look at those ducks how delighted they seem All plashing &amp; cleaning themselves in the stream &amp; the swallow that loves in black chimneys to sing Will scarcely dart oer without washing his wing Now were out of the town see the fields how they smile So sweet that the boy climbs astride on the stile To gaze round about him as much as to say I should like to go where it pleased me to day But poor little fellow he wishes in spite Of his toil—for his sheep they want tending till night Look here as we come in this cool narrow lane How close martins pass us &amp; pass us again Darting on by the side of the hedges they go As swift as an arrow shot out of a bow The dust is all past which we met in the street &amp; the grass like a carpet spreads under our feet See theres a fine Butterflye sits on that leaf Aye you may go creeping as still as a thief It can hear you &amp; see you—see there up it flies With wings like the rain bow youve seen in the skies Yes yes you may run there it crosses the stream As far out of reach as a joy in a dream Aye now it delights ye to look at the sky Those are hawks sailing proud as the clouds &amp; as high See there ones at rest hanging still even now As fixed in the air as a bird on a bough These are sweet sights in sooth but the milking maid sees The sky every morning wear sweeter than these When she hies to her cows while the sun large &amp; round Starts up like a table of fire from the ground &amp; she sees it so often she gives it no praise Though some never saw it not once all their days This morning I marked in what splendour he rose Like a king of the east ere his journey he goes His bed in the skys any fancy might trace With a curtain of scarlet half hiding his face Then as he rose up to his throne for a seat It changed to a carpet of gold at his feet Then as a majicians wand touched it there came A dye oer the east of all hues ye can name A dappled profusion of gold blue &amp; red Like pavements of rubies where angels may tread A shadow een now of its splendour remains Like an old ruined tapestry all blotches &amp; stains Giving lessons of grandeur &amp; earthly parade To think even heaven hath glories that fade Nay sigh not at all you shall see bye &amp; bye The sun rise as oft as the milkmaid &amp; I Stop theres a whasps nest what a bustle &amp; hum Like legions of armies where danger is come There they rush one by one in their jackets of yellow Not one offers fight but he's backed by his fellow So come on nor reach at that rose on the bower We'll hazard no wounds for the sake of a flower Heres the snail with his fine painted shell at his back &amp; theres one without in his jacket of black The paths even covered with insects—each sort Flock by crowds in the smiles of the morning to sport Theres the cricket in brown &amp; his couzin in green The Grasshopper dancing &amp; oer them is seen The lady bird dressed like a hunter in red Creeping out from the blossoms with whom she went bed So good little girls now disturb not their play &amp; you Freddy stop till they hop far away For to kill them in sport as a many folks will &amp; call it a pastime tis cruel &amp; ill As their lives are as sweet of enjoyment as ours &amp; they doat like yourselves upon sunshine &amp; flowers See yonders some boys all at swee in the cool On the wood riding gate playing truant from school How gladly they seek the fields freedom to play To swee creaking gates &amp; to roll in the hay Mocking loud the wood ecchoes that answer again In musical haloos so soft &amp; so plain That they no longer dread them as jiants or elves But think them all boys fond of sport as themselves &amp; they shout in their pastimes to coax them away From the woods gloomy arbours to join in their play Now loves ye are weary I see by your walk Well well heres a sweet cock of hay on the baulk An ash hung with ivy too leans from the stile So sit you down here &amp; we'll rest us awhile But not on that molehill for see what a mass Of pismires are nimbling about in the grass If you had crumbs to throw them theyed haul them away &amp; never seem weary the whole summers day &amp; if you sit on them as small as they are Theyll sting you &amp; teaze you so prythee beware Do but look how the fields slope away from our eyes Till the trees in the distance seem clouds in the skyes A map spreads about us in greens of all stains Dark woods paler meadows &amp; fields varied grains &amp; look oer the gap of yon hedge &amp; behold Yon turnip lands seeming as littered with gold Tis the charlock in blossom a troublesome weed Yet a beautiful sight in the distance indeed They are nought for a nosegay yet still in fine weather You see what a show they make growing together Aye yonder are steeples that catch on the eye Like jiants of stone stretching up the blue sky &amp; windmills are sweeping their sails up &amp; down &amp; cottages peeping all sunny &amp; brown See the cows grazing yonder &amp; less quiet sheep Some at feed &amp; some chewing their cuds till they sleep Thus the prospect in varied profusions abound &amp; spreadeth a beautiful picture around Though there shines no old ruins for artists to prize Nor mountains to thrust up their heads to the skyes Yet as like Dewints pictures as nature can be For nature owns no sweeter painter than he Nay dont be alarmed &amp; start up from the hay Thats nought but a little mouse running away &amp; now she finds out we're not foes to destroy Do but hear in the grass how she chitters for joy No doubt in the beans nigh at hand may sojourn Her childern awaiting her mothers return See there where the willow bends over the brook At our feet like an old shepherd over his crook Neath its boughs Gnats &amp; midges are still at their play Like ball rooms of faireys all dancing away Aye there in rich dress goes the great dragon flye Like another proud thing buzzing scornfully bye He scarce turns his head on their dancing &amp; glee &amp; theyre full as carless of notice as he O dont you my Anna be cruel &amp; vain The smallest of things are not strangers to pain That long legged shepherd youve caught let him go For he knows naught at all what you threaten no no Though you tell him you'll kill both his son &amp; his daughter If he will not afford you a small drop of water Your threats &amp; your language he cant understand Though he sheds tears for freedom while shut in your hand &amp; heres little Freddy crying “click clocking clay” Poh—Lady birds know not the time of the day Of “one oclock two oclock” no such a thing So give it its freedom &amp; let it take wing Well now if your rested we'll wander again Here the path strides the brook over closes of grain So who's first to venture—come never see fear Though the plank bends beneath us [no] danger is near Well if you are fearful we'll turn back &amp; go Where stepping stones ford oer a shallow below Dangers seldom my childern so near as we think &amp; often seems far when we stand on the brink As the runlet in shallows bawls loud &amp; in deeps Decietfully sinks into silence &amp; sleeps Do but try how delicious those bean blossoms smell No flower in the garden delights me so well Perfuming the nest of the Partridge that lies Basking safe in the shadows their forrest supplies &amp; the hare heres a beaten path tracks her retreat Feels timidly safe in her corn covered seat On this mown baulk no doubt she oft ventures to play When a grasshoppers rustle might fright her away How sweet &amp; how happy such places appear Well indeed may you wish that our cottage was here With the wild bees for neighbours the whole summer long &amp; the Lark ever near us a piping his song With the beans in full blossom close up to our door &amp; cows in the distance at feed on the moor &amp; grasshoppers singing wherere we might roam &amp; partridges calling at night by our home Where we might sit at eve in our parlour &amp; see The rabbit bob out from that old hollow tree &amp; hear from yon thicket so gloomy &amp; deep The sweet little nightingale sing us to sleep Which we heard tother night—dont you reccolect now When I clomb the wood stile to get each one a bough How one sung “jug jug” &amp; you all sung amain “Jug jug” &amp; laughed loud as it answered again Aye aye I knew well such a beautiful song Would not be so quickly forgot come along For the day gets so hot you may well wish again To meet with the coolness we left in the lane Do but [look] at our shadows what strangers weve got Those jiants that came with us first from our cot Stalking on stride for stride in a pomp stirring mood Nigh as tall as the oaks that lay peeled by the wood Whose long legs might cross a brook ever so wide &amp; leap oer a hedge nay a house at a stride Theyve left us &amp; shrunk from our sight by degrees To childern &amp; dwarfs scarce as high as our knees That as we go on shrink so close to our feet As if they were glad to get out of the heat Come here is the foot path that leads to the town Dont stop tis so hot loves we cannot sit down O I see what delights ye—aye climb on the stile &amp; look round about as ye wish for awhile Those things that go sweeing away to the wind Though the willows scarce move that are growing behind Are the sails of the Mill—&amp; indeed as you say They follow each other like things in their play Now dropping then rising their wearisome round &amp; seem where you stand to spring out of the ground Yon shepherd boy doubtless thinks so as he lies Lolling oer the gate gazing in happy supprise See now they move slower the winds nearly still &amp; there comes the miller—look—out of his mill To peep at the weather with meal powderd oer More white then the dog rose in bloom by the door See there goes the mower a sweeping away &amp; yon folks in the nook see are stacking of hay Some loading some forking the grounds are alive With their labour as busy as bees in a hive Theres no one seems idle but this little boy Who runs after butterflyes bawling for joy &amp; now he has run like a fox in the wheat If the farmer came bye he would surely get beat The partridge whirs up frit away from her nest &amp; the hare with the morning dew yet on her breast Jumps away from his hustle &amp; bustle &amp; noise Which he makes in the midst of his rapture &amp; joys Now singing &amp; tearing up weeds of all sorts Showy corn poppys shining like foxhunters coats &amp; bluecaps &amp; cockleflowers no matter what To make a gay garland to stick in his hat &amp; now he struts out what a gesture he wears As proud of his colours as soldiers of theirs &amp; why may he not be as vain as the rest Of proud folk were the proudest are baubles at best —Yes summer indeed bringeth pleasure to all That colt feels its freedom now loosed from its stall &amp; even this wearisome wayfaring ass Can find on the common his bunches of grass While round the warped camp neath yon bushes &amp; trees The gipseys lie basking themselves at their ease &amp; the gipsey boys shaking their rags to the sun Are head over ears in their frolic &amp; fun Chasing barefoot along with their dogs by their side Barking loud as the rabbits bob by them to hide See there sit the swath summer lovers at play Neath the shade of those broad spreading maples all day Those brown tawney lasses with lips like a cherry &amp; hair full as dark as the autumn blackberry The mole hillocks make them soft cushions for love &amp; the hedges in harbours hang blooming above As blest as the rich who on sofas reposes They toy neath the shades of wild woodbines &amp; roses —Now look at the sky it grows muddy with showers &amp; black snails are creeping about in the flowers The daisey too look tis a good weather glass It seems even now half asleep in the grass &amp; other flowers too like the sun on the wane Are shutting their eyes &amp; seem dreaming of rain While that shepherd boy yonder is startled from sleep Peeping up at the sky as he bawls to his sheep No doubt he is seeking his hut by the hedge All wattled with willows &amp; covered with sedge To lie on his bed of cut brakes &amp; be dry While the threatened approach of the storm lessens bye Now I see you are glad to get sight of the town See theres the old spire &amp; below it look down Our cottage is peeping aye now you see't plain As if it was happy to find us again &amp; happy am I we're so nigh to the door So run in &amp; take to your play as before Or rest in your chairs from the toils of the day By the oak bough that blooms in the chimney so gay See there waining sunbeams they twitter &amp; fall Through the diamond paned window to dance on the wall The pictures seem smiling its glitter to court &amp; up jumps the kitten to join in the sport Aye well may you say you are glad weve got home For sweeter it seemeth the farther we roam So now we'll sit down &amp; enjoy at our ease The rest leisure gives us &amp; do as we please Take your toys or read lessons &amp; chatter between Of the walk we have had &amp; the things we have seen &amp; while you are pleasing or resting yourselves I'll reach down a poet I love from the shelves My Thompson or Cowper like flowers in their prime That set not in closets to study &amp; ryhme But roamed out of doors for their verses that yield A freshness like that which we left in the field That sing both at once to the ear &amp; the eye &amp; breath of the air &amp; the grass &amp; the sky A music so sweet while we're hid from the rain That we even seem taking our rambles again MARY LEE I have traced the valleys fair In may mornings dewy air My bonny Mary Lee Wilt thou deign the wreath to wear Gathered all for thee They are not flowers of pride For they graced the dingle side Yet they grew in heavens smile My gentle Mary Lee Can they fear thy frowns the while Though offered all by me Heres the lily of the vale That perfumed the morning gale My fairey Mary Lee All so spotless &amp; so pale Like thine own purity &amp; might I make it known Tis an emblem of my own Love—if I dare so name My esteem for thee Surely flowers can bear no blame My bonny Mary Lee Heres the violets modest blue That neath awthorns hides from view My gentle Mary Lee Would show whose heart is true While it thinks of thee Though they chuse each lowly spot The sun disdains them not I m as lowly too indeed My charming Mary Lee So Ive brought these flowers to plead &amp; win a smile from thee Heres a wild rose just in bud Springs beauty in its hood My bonny Mary Lee Tis the first in all the wood I could find for thee Though a blush is scarcely seen Yet it hides its worth within Like my love for Ive no power My angel Mary Lee To speak unless the flower Can plead excuse for me Though they deck no princely halls In bouquets for glittering balls My gentle Mary Lee Richer hues than painted walls Might make them dear to thee For the blue &amp; laughing sky Spreads a grander canopy Than all wealths golden skill My charming Mary Lee Love would make them dearer still That offers them to thee My wreath of flowers are few Yet no fairer drank the dew My bonny Mary Lee &amp; may seem as trifles too Yet not I hope to thee Some may boast a richer prize Under pride &amp; wealths disguise None a fonder offering bore Then mine to thee &amp; can true love wish for more Surely not Mary Lee THE COTTAGER True as the church clock hand the hour pursues He plods about his toils &amp; reads the news &amp; at the blacksmiths shop his hour will stand To talk of “Lunun” as a foreign land For from his cottage door in peace or strife He neer went fifty miles in all his life His knowledge with old notions still combined Is twenty years behind the march of mind He views new knowledge with suspicious eyes &amp; thinks it blasphemy to be so wise Oer steams almighty tales he wondering looks As witchcraft gleaned from old blackletter books Life gave him comfort but denied him wealth He toils in quiet &amp; enjoys his health He smokes a pipe at night &amp; drinks his beer &amp; runs no scores on tavern screens to clear He goes to market all the year about &amp; keeps one hour &amp; never stays it out Een at St Thomas tide old Rovers bark Hails dapples trot an hour before its dark He is a simple worded plain old man Whose good intents take errors in their plan Oft sentimental &amp; with saddend vein He looks on trifles &amp; bemoans their pain &amp; thinks the angler mad &amp; loudly storms With emphasis of speech oer murdered worms &amp; hunters cruel—pleading with sad care Pitys petition for the fox &amp; hare Yet feels self satisfaction in his woes For wars crushed myriads of his slaughterd foes He is right scrupelous in one pretext &amp; wholesale errors swallows in the next He deems it sin to sing yet not to say A song a mighty difference in his way &amp; many a moving tale in antique ryhmes He has for christmass &amp; such merry times When Chevy chase his masterpiece of song Is said so earnest none can think it long Twas the old Vicars way who should be right For the late Vicar was his hearts delight &amp; while at church he often shakes his head To think what sermons the old vicar made Downright orthodox that all the land Who had their ears to hear might understand But now such mighty learning meets his ears He thinks it greek or latin which he hears Yet church recieves him every sabbath day &amp; rain or snow he never keeps away All words of reverence still his heart reveres Low bows his head when Jesus meets his ears &amp; still he thinks it blasphemy as well Such names without a capital to spell In an old corner cupboard by the wall His books are laid—though good in number small His bible first in place—from worth &amp; age Whose grandsires name adorns the title page &amp; blank leaves once now filled with kindred claims Display a worlds epitome of names Parents &amp; childern &amp; grandchildern all Memorys affections in the lists recall &amp; Prayer book next much worn though strongly bound Proves him a churchman orthodox &amp; sound The “Pilgrims Progress” too &amp; “Death of Abel” Are seldom missing from his reading table &amp; prime old Tusser in his homely trim The first of bards in all the world with him &amp; only poet which his leisure knows —Verse deals in fancy so he sticks to prose These are the books he reads &amp; reads again &amp; weekly hunts the almanacks for rain Here &amp; no further learnings channels ran Still neighbours prize him as the learned man His cottage is a humble place of rest With one spare room to welcome every guest &amp; that tall poplar pointing to the sky His own hand planted when an idle boy It shades his chimney while the singing wind Hums songs of shelter to his happy mind Within his cot the “largest ears of corn” He ever found his picture frames adorn Brave Granbys head De Grasses grand defeat He rubs his hands &amp; tells how Rodney beat &amp; from the rafters upon strings depend Beanstalks beset with pods from end to end Whose numbers without counting may be seen Wrote on the Almanack behind the screen Around the corner upon worsted strung Pootys in wreaths above the cupboards hung Memory at trifling incidents awakes &amp; there he keeps them for his childerns sakes Who when as boys searched every sedgey lane Traced every wood &amp; shattered cloaths again Roaming about on raptures easy wing To hunt those very pooty shells in spring &amp; thus he lives too happy to be poor While strife neer pauses at so mean a door Low in the sheltered valley stands his cot He hears the mountain storm—&amp; feels it not Winter &amp; spring toil ceasing ere tis dark Rests with the lamb &amp; rises with the lark Content is helpmate to the days employ &amp; care neer comes to steal a single joy Time scarcely noticed turns his hair to grey Yet leaves him happy as a child at play NATURES MELODYS THE MUSIC OF THE STORM All nature owns in glory The Lord &amp; power of all With everlasting story &amp; never ceasing call The great “I am” emblazoned Is seen of every eye On natures humblest blossom On thunders grandest sky Man nature all upbraids him Who stands in terror bye She lauds the God that made him Her sounds are “glorify” Hark how the tempest sounding Wings music through the air &amp; clouds like whales are bounding To own his presence there The sun whose splendid glory Shamed darkness into flight &amp; told morns noble story From whence he borrowed light &amp; now in gloomy splendours God bids the tempests lour How meekly he surrenders To a superior power All natures shining splendour Withdraws her light awhile Right willing to surrender Her light till God shall smile The earth the sky the ocean Sun moon &amp; stars &amp; all Pay natures grand devotion &amp; own their makers call The woods are like a[n] ocean All moving at his breath Praise spreads the wild commotion Around above beneath The mighty oak is bending In worship to his power &amp; in submission blending Soft trembles every flower Morns sky in dappled livery A sea of happy isles Heard thunders noble reverie &amp; now no longer smiles The sky has lost its glory The clouds their hues resign &amp; storms in splendid story Owns god is all divine Hark how the tempest groaning Extolls his majesty &amp; echo gladly owning In worship makes reply More proud &amp; yet more proudly The tempest dares along More loud &amp; yet more loudly The thunder wakes his song A song of mighty praises To him who reigns alone Whose power all nature raises In unison as one The mountains burning crater The valleys crowded sod The forrests leafy nature Are all the voice of God Man hears &amp; heedeth nothing Man sees &amp; turns aside His thoughts such interests loathing Are bound to scorn &amp; pride All else of Gods adornings Great small &amp; weak &amp; strong Attend to natures warnings &amp; thousands greet her song THE CALM Beneath my feet the very dust Up with the wirlwinds summonds flies To tell the doubting &amp; the just That even dust shall greet the skys Beside my path the flowers &amp; grass In trembling joy their praises pay Yet unobserving man goes bye Nor gleans a lesson in his way Though nature breaths in quiet moods &amp; wooes the heart in gentle ways A sterner power with time intrudes Shall waken all to fear &amp; praise When death shall rise on every eye &amp; blend his voice with every call When all but natures debt shall die &amp; man the debtor pay for all That day shall come &amp; mighty storms Each year its coming typifyes Yet what are thunders dread alarms To that shall bid the dead to rise The wind the water fire &amp; all As actors in that dreadful play Make ready in their parts to fall Rehearsing portions every day Yet man ordained in every scene To act the first &amp; chiefest part Neglects to feel the part he's in Nor gets a single page by heart Although the stage be worlds destroyed The curtains torn unpillared skyes The actor man by God employed To do his part of smiles or sighs Life everlastingly enjoyed Or pains unceasing sacrifice —&amp; I by idle things employed Dread what the finale typifyes THE SUMMER SHOWER I love it well oercanopied in leaves Of crowding woods to spend a quiet hour &amp; where the woodbine weaves To list the summer shower Brought by the south west wind that balm &amp; bland Breaths luscious coolness loved &amp; felt by all While on the uplifted hand The rain drops gently fall Now quickening on &amp; on the pattering woods Recieves the coming shower birds trim their wings &amp; in a joyful mood The little woodchat sings &amp; blackbird squatting on her mortared nest Safe hid in ivy &amp; the pathless wood Pruneth her sooty breast &amp; warms her downy brood &amp; little Pettichap like hurrying mouse Keeps nimbling near my arbour round &amp; round Aye theres her oven house Built nearly on the ground Of woodbents withered straws &amp; moss &amp; leaves &amp; lined with downy feathers saftys joy Dwells with the home she weaves Nor fears the pilfering boy The busy falling rain increases now &amp; sopping leaves their dripping moisture pour &amp; from each loaded bough Fast falls the double shower Weed climbing hedges banks &amp; meeds unmown Where rushy fringed brooklet easy curls Look joyous while the rain Strings their green suit[with] pearls While from the crouching corn the weeding troop Run hastily &amp; huddling in a ring Where the old willows stoop Their ancient ballads sing &amp; gabble over wonders ceasless tale Till from the southwest sky showers thicker come Humming along the vale &amp; bids them hasten home With laughing skip they stride the hasty brook That mutters through the weeds untill it gains A clear &amp; quiet nook To greet the dimpling rain &amp; on they drabble all in mirth not mute Leaving their footmarks on the elting soil Where print of sprawling foot Stirs up a tittering smile On beautys lips who slipping mid the crowd Blushes to have her anckle seen so high Yet inly feeleth proud That none a fault can spy Yet rudely followed by the meddling clown Who passes vulgar gibes—the bashful maid Lets go her folded gown &amp; pauses half afraid To climb the stile before him till the dame To quarrel half provoked assails the knave &amp; laughs him into shame &amp; makes him well behave Birdnesting boys oertaken in the rain Beneath the ivied maple bustling run &amp; wait in anxious pain Impatient for the sun &amp; sigh for home yet at the pasture gate The molehill tossing bull with straining eye Seemeth their steps to wait Nor dare they pass him bye Till wearied out high over hedge they scrawl To shun the road &amp; through the wet grass roam Till wet &amp; draggled all They fear to venture home The plough team wet &amp; dripping plashes home &amp; on the horse the ploughboy lolls along Yet from the wet grounds come The loud &amp; merry song Now neath the leafy arch of dripping bough That loaded trees form oer the narrow lane The horse released from plough Naps the moist grass again Around their blanket camps the gipseys still Heedless of showers while black thorns shelter round Jump oer the pasture hills In many an idle bound From dark green clumps among the dripping grain The lark with sudden impulse starts &amp; sings &amp; mid the smoaking rain Quivers her russet wings A joy inspiring calmness all around Breaths a refreshing sense of strengthening power Like that which toil hath found In sundays leisure hour When spirits all relaxed heartsick of toil Seeks out the pleasant woods &amp; shadowy dells &amp; where the fountain boils Lye listening distant bells Amid the yellow furze the rabbits bed Labour hath hid his tools &amp; oer the heath Hies to the milking shed That stands the oak beneath &amp; there he wiles the pleasant shower away Filling his mind with store of happy things Rich crops of corn &amp; hay &amp; all that plenty brings The crampt horison now leans on the ground Quiet &amp; cool &amp; labours hard employ Ceases while all around Falls a refreshing joy TO CONTENT Cheerful content thy home be mine Do not my suit disdain They who prefer the worlds to thine Shall find it false &amp; vain From broken hopes &amp; storms I fly To hide me in thy peaceful sky The flatterers meet with smiles The cunning find their friends Whoso without makes pilgrimage Shall meet but small amends As childern they who in the sun Seek flowers in winter &amp; find none Some cringe to menial slaves Some worship haughty power Some bend the knee to knaves The price of earthly dower Which they who were not taught to pay May see &amp; empty turn away Earths pleasure is to flatter Lifes love is but to hate To praise what they in heart abuse Alas in church &amp; state &amp; whoso makes not this their game Shall keep their wants &amp; shun the shame Thus flattery findeth friends In every grade &amp; state Thus telling truth offends The lowly &amp; the great Yet truth at last shall bloom &amp; rise When flatterys folly fades &amp; dies Prides pomps are shadows all Mere wealth is honours toys Whose merits oft are small Whose praise but empty noise Rainbows upon the skys of May Fade soon but scarce so soon as they Then sweet content thy home be mine If sorrows should pursue Thoult shake them from those smiles of thine As morning does the dew &amp; as thoughts broken hopes decay My heart shall struggle &amp; be gay As hopes from earth shall dissapear With thee I'll not despair For thou canst look at heaven &amp; hear The vagrant calling there &amp; see her smile &amp; sweetly see The loss she met was gain to me LOVE &amp; MEMORY Thou art gone the dark journey That leaves no returning Tis fruitless to mourn thee But who can help mourning To think of the life That did laugh on thy brow In the beautiful past Left so desolate now When youth seemed immortal So sweet did it weave Heavens haloo around thee Earths hopes to decieve Thou fairest &amp; dearest Where many were fair To my heart thou art nearest Though this name is but there The nearer the fountain More pure the stream flows &amp; sweeter to fancy The bud of the rose &amp; now thourt in heaven More pure is the birth Of thoughts that wake of thee Than ought upon earth As a bud green in spring As a rose blown in June Thy beauty looked out &amp; departed as soon Heaven saw thee too fair For earths tennants of clay &amp; ere age did thee wrong Thou wert summoned away I know thou art happy Why in grief need I be Yet I am &amp; the more so To feel its for thee For thy presence possest As thy abscence destroyed The most that I loved &amp; the all I enjoyed So I try to seek pleasure But vainly I try Now joys cup is drained &amp; hopes fountain is dry I mix with the living Yet what do I see Only more cause for sorrow In loosing of thee The year has its winter As well as its May So the sweetest must leave us &amp; the fairest decay Suns leave us to night &amp; their light none may borrow So joy retreats from us Overtaken by sorrow The sun greets the spring &amp; the blossom the bee The grass the blea hill &amp; the leaf the bare tree But suns nor yet seasons As sweet as they be Shall ever more greet me With tidings of thee The voice of the cuckoo Is merry at noon &amp; the song of the nightingale Gladdens the moon But the gayest to day May be saddest to morrow &amp; the loudest in joy Sink the deepest in sorrow For the lovely in death &amp; the fairest must die Fall once &amp; for ever Like stars from the sky So in vain do I mourn thee I know its in vain Who would wish thee from joy To earths troubles again Yet thy love shed upon me Life more then mine own &amp; now thou art from me My being is gone Words know not my grief Thus without thee to dwell Yet in one I felt all When life bade thee farewell THE FALLEN ELM Old elm that murmured in our chimney top The sweetest anthem autumn ever made &amp; into mellow whispering calms would drop When showers fell on thy many coloured shade &amp; when dark tempests mimic thunder made While darkness came as it would strangle light With the black tempest of a winter night That rocked thee like a cradle to thy root How did I love to hear the winds upbraid Thy strength without—while all within was mute It seasoned comfort to our hearts desire We felt thy kind protection like a friend &amp; edged our chairs up closer to the fire Enjoying comforts that was never penned Old favourite tree thoust seen times changes lower Though change till now did never injure thee For time beheld thee as her sacred dower &amp; nature claimed thee her domestic tree Storms came &amp; shook thee many a weary hour Yet stedfast to thy home thy roots hath been Summers of thirst parched round thy homely bower Till earth grew iron—still thy leaves was green The childern sought thee in thy summer shade &amp; made their play house rings of sticks &amp; stone The mavis sang &amp; felt himself alone While in thy leaves his early nest was made &amp; I did feel his happiness mine own Nought heeding that our friendship was betrayed Friend not inanimate—though stocks &amp; stones There are &amp; many formed of flesh &amp; bones Thou owned a language by which hearts are stirred Deeper then by a feeling cloathed in words &amp; speakest now whats known of every tongue Language of pity &amp; the force of wrong What cant assumes what hypocrites will dare Speaks home to truth &amp; shows it what they are I see a picture which thy fate displays &amp; learn a lesson from thy destiny Self interest saw thee stand in freedoms ways So thy old shadow must a tyrant be Thoust heard the knave abusing those in power Bawl freedom loud &amp; then opress the free Thoust sheltered hypocrites in many a shower That when in power would never shelter thee Thoust heard the knave supply his canting powers With wrongs illusions when he wanted friends That bawled for shelter when he lived in showers &amp; when clouds vanished made thy shade amends With axe at root he felled thee to the ground &amp; barked of freedom—O I hate the sound Time hears its visions speak &amp; age sublime Had made thee a deciple unto time —It grows the cant term of enslaving tools To wrong another by the name of right It grows the liscence of oerbearing fools To cheat plain honesty by force of might Thus came enclosure—ruin was its guide But freedoms clapping hands enjoyed the sight Though comforts cottage soon was thrust aside &amp; workhouse prisons raised upon the scite Een natures dwellings far away from men The common heath became the spoilers prey The rabbit had not where to make his den &amp; labours only cow was drove away No matter—wrong was right &amp; right was wrong &amp; freedoms bawl was sanction to the song —Such was thy ruin music making elm The rights of freedom was to injure thine As thou wert served so would they overwhelm In freedoms name the little that is mine &amp; there are knaves that brawl for better laws &amp; cant of tyranny in stronger powers Who glut their vile unsatiated maws &amp; freedoms birthright from the weak devours THE OLD SHEPHERD Tis pleasant to bear reccolections in mind Of joys that time hurrys away To look back on smiles that have past like the wind &amp; compare them with frowns of to day Twas the joy of old Robin forsooth Oer the past with fond pleasure to dwell To recount the fond loves of his joys &amp; his youth &amp; days of lost pleasures to tell “Tis now many years” like a child he would say “Since I joined in the sports of the green Since I tied up the flowers for the garlands of may &amp; danced with the holiday queen Reccolections look backward in sorrowful pride Reccolections look forward in tears To the past when my happiness withered &amp; died &amp; the present dull desolate years” “I love to be counting while sitting alone With many a heart aching sigh How many a season has rapidly flown &amp; springs with their summers gone bye Since Susan the pride of the village was deemed To whom youths affections I gave Whom I led to the church &amp; beloved &amp; esteemed &amp; followed in grief to the grave Lifes changes for many hours musings supply How the past &amp; the present appear To mark how a few passing years hurry bye When nothing is left as it where The youth that with me to mans summer did bloom Have dwindled away to old men &amp; maidens like flowers of the spring have made room For many new blossoms since then I have lived to see all but lifes sorrows pass bye Leaving changes &amp; pains &amp; decay Where nought is the same but the wide spreading sky &amp; the sun that awakens the day The green where I tended my sheep when a boy Has yielded its pride to the plough &amp; the shades where my infancy revelled in joy The axe has left desolate now Yet a bush lingers still that invites me to stop What heart can such whimsies withstand Where Susan once saw a birds nest in its top &amp; I reached her the eggs with my hand &amp; so long since the day I remember it well It has stretched to a sizable tree &amp; the birds yearly come in its branches to dwell As far from a jiant as me On a favourite spot by the side of a brook When Susan was just in her prime A ripe bunch of nutts from her apron she took &amp; planted them close by my side It has grown up with years &amp; on many a bough Groweth nutts like its parent agen Where shepherds no doubt have oft sought them ere now To please other susans since then The joys that I knew when my youth was in prime Like a dream thats half ended is oer &amp; the faces I knew in that changable time Are seen with the living no more I have lived to see friends that I loved pass away With the pleasures their company gave I have lived to see love with my susan decay &amp; the grass growing green on her grave Poor Rover the mate of my youths summer day That came to my whistle with pride That shared the first years of my labour &amp; play Grew old in my friendship &amp; died &amp; this old friend that now lyeth down by my feet Looks as old as his master to be Yet when the past scenes of my life I repeat He even seems a new comer to me Thus oft oer his staff the old shepherd would bend Recounting in sorrowful pride The things of his youth while some young shepherd friend Stood to listen the tales by his side— The pleasures of youth when too late we esteem When its follys no longer engage When the beautiful past like a midsummer dream Looks green through the winter of age NAPOLEON The heroes of the present &amp; the past Were puny vague &amp; nothingness to thee Thou grasped a span almighty to the last &amp; strained for glory when thy die was cast That little island on the mighty sea Was but a dust spot in a lake thy mind Swept space as shoreless as eternity Thy jiant powers outstript this gaudy age Of heroes &amp; as looking at the sun Gazing upon thy greatness made them blind To merits that had adoration won In olden times—for leaving kings behind The world was but a comma on thy page Of victorys—&amp; fame a crowded mind That found no room such greatness to presage Thy prophets now are a superior kind To friends or enemies—for natures eye Sweeps over space great shadows to reclaim &amp; time—thy fate thy monument &amp; fame Links thee with names that cannot fade or die SPORT IN THE MEADOWS Maytime is to the meadows coming in &amp; cowslap peeps have gotten eer so big &amp; water blobs &amp; all their golden kin Crowd round the shallows by the striding brig Daisys &amp; buttercups &amp; lady smocks Are all abouten shining here &amp; there Nodding about their gold &amp; yellow locks Like morts of folken flocking at a fair The sheep &amp; cows are crowding for a share &amp; snatch the blossoms in such eager haste That basket bearing childern running there Do think within their hearts theyll get them all &amp; hoot &amp; drive them from their gracless waste As though there wa'n't a cowslap peep to spare —For they want some for tea &amp; some for wine &amp; some to maken up a cuckaball To throw accross the garlands silken line That reaches oer the street from wall to wall —Good gracious me how merrily they fare One sees a fairer cowslap then the rest &amp; off they shout—the foremost bidding fair To get the prize—&amp; earnest half &amp; jest The next one pops her down—&amp; from her hand Her basket falls &amp; out her cowslaps all Tumble &amp; litter there—the merry band In laughing friendship round about her fall To helpen gather up the littered flowers That she no loss may mourn—&amp; now the wind In frolic mood among the merry hours Wakens with sudden start &amp; tosses off Some untied bonnet on its dancing wings Away they follow with a scream &amp; laugh &amp; aye the youngest ever lags behind Till on the deep lakes very brink it hings They shout &amp; catch it &amp; then off they start To chase for cowslaps merry as before &amp; each one seems so anxious at the heart As they would even get them all &amp; more One climbs a molehill for a bunch of may One stands on tiptoe for a linnets nest &amp; pricks her hand &amp; throws her flowers away &amp; runs for plantin leaves to have it drest So do they run abouten all the day &amp; teaze the grass hid larks from getting rest —Scarce give they time in their unruly haste To tie a shoestring that the grass unties &amp; thus they run the meadows bloom to waste Till even comes &amp; dulls their phantasys When one finds losses out to stifle smiles Of silken bonnet strings—&amp; uthers sigh Oer garments renten clambering over stiles Yet in the morning fresh afield they hie Bidding the last days troubles all good bye When red pied cow again their coming hears &amp; ere they clap the gate she tosses up Her head &amp; hastens from the sport she fears The old yoe calls her lamb nor cares to stoop To crop a cowslap in their company Thus merrily the little noisey troop Along the grass as rude marauders hie For ever noisey &amp; forever gay While keeping in the meadows holiday WILD BEES These childern of the sun which summer brings As pastoral minstrels in her merry train Pipe rustic ballads upon busy wings &amp; glad the cotters quiet toils again The white nosed bee that bores its little hole In mortared walls &amp; pipes its symphonies &amp; never absent couzin black as cole That indian like bepaints its little thighs With white &amp; red bedight for holiday Right earlily a morn do pipe &amp; play &amp; with their legs stroke slumber from their eyes &amp; aye so fond they of their singing seem That in their holes a bed at close of day They still keep piping in their honey dreams &amp; larger ones that thrum on ruder pipe Round the sweet smelling closen &amp; rich woods Where tawney white &amp; red flushed clover buds Shine bonnily &amp; beanfields blossom ripe Shed dainty perfumes &amp; give honey food To these sweet poets of the summer field Me much delighting as I stroll along The narrow path that hay laid meadow yields Catching the windings of their wandering song The black &amp; yellow bumble first on wing To buzz among the sallows early flowers Hiding its nest in holes from fickle spring Who stints his rambles with her frequent showers &amp; one that may for wiser piper pass In livery dress half sables &amp; half red Who laps a moss ball in the meadow grass &amp; hurds her stores when april showers have fled &amp; russet commoner who knows the face Of every blossom that the meadows brings Starting the traveller to a quicker pace By threatening round his head in many rings These sweeten summer in their happy glee By giving for her honey melodie THE NIGHTINGALES NEST Up this green woodland ride lets softly rove &amp; list the nightingale—she dwelleth here Hush let the wood gate softly clap—for fear The noise might drive her from her home of love For here Ive heard her many a merry year At morn &amp; eve nay all the live long day As though she lived on song—this very spot Just where that old mans beard all wildly trails Rude arbours oer the rode &amp; stops the way &amp; where that child its blue bell flowers hath got Laughing &amp; creeping through the mossy rails There have I hunted like a very boy Creeping on hands &amp; knees through matted thorns To find her nest &amp; see her feed her young &amp; vainly did I many hours employ All seemed as hidden as a thought unborn &amp; where these crimping fern leaves ramp among The hazels underboughs—Ive nestled down &amp; watched her while she sung—&amp; her renown Hath made me marvel that so famed a bird Should have no better dress then russet brown Her wings would tremble in her extacy &amp; feathers stand on end as 'twere with joy &amp; mouth wide open to release her heart Of its out sobbing songs—the happiest part Of summers fame she shared—for so to me Did happy fancies shapen her employ But if I touched a bush or scarcely stirred All in a moment stopt—I watched in vain The timid bird had left the hazel bush &amp; at a distance hid to sing again Lost in a wilderness of listening leaves Rich extacy would pour its luscious strain Till envy spurred the emulating thrush To start less wild &amp; scarce inferior songs For cares with him for half the year remain To damp the ardour of his speckled breast While nightingales to summers life belongs &amp; naked trees &amp; winters nipping wrongs Are strangers to her music &amp; her rest Her joys are evergreen her world is wide —Hark there she is as usual lets be hush For in this black thorn clump if rightly guest Her curious house is hidden—part aside These hazel branches in a gentle way &amp; stoop right cautious neath the rustling boughs For we will have another search to day &amp; hunt this fern strown thorn clump round &amp; round &amp; where this seeded woodgrass idly bows We'll wade right through it is a likely nook In such like spots &amp; often on the ground Theyll build where rude boys never think to look Aye as I live her secret nest is here Upon this white thorn stulp—I've searched about For hours in vain—there put that bramble bye Nay trample on its branches &amp; get near —How subtle is the bird she started out &amp; raised a plaintive note of danger nigh Ere we were past the brambles &amp; now near Her nest she sudden stops—as choaking fear That might betray her home—so even now We'll leave it as we found it—safetys guard Of pathless solitudes shall keep it still See there shes sitting on the old oak bough Mute in her fears—our presence doth retard Her joys &amp; doubt turns every rapture chill Sing on sweet bird may no worse hap befall Thy visions then the fear that now decieves We will not plunder music of its dower Nor turn this spot of happiness to thrall For melody seems hid in every flower That blossoms near thy home—these harebells all Seems bowing with the beautiful in song &amp; gaping cuckoo with its spotted leaves Seems blushing of the singing it has heard How curious is the nest no other bird Uses such loose materials or weaves Their dwellings in such spots—dead oaken leaves Are placed without &amp; velvet moss within &amp; little scraps or grass—&amp; scant &amp; spare Of what seems scarce materials down &amp; hair For from mans haunts she seemeth nought to win Yet nature is the builder &amp; contrives Homes for her childerns comfort even here Where solitudes deciples spend their lives Unseen save when a wanderer passes near That loves such pleasant places—Deep adown The nest is made an hermits mossy cell Snug lies her curious eggs in number five Of deadened green or rather olive brown &amp; the old prickly thorn bush guards them well &amp; here we'll leave them still unknown to wrong As the old woodlands legacy of song VASCO NUNEZ ON HIS ENEMIES AFTER READING WASHINGTON IRVINGS LIVES OF THE EARLY NAVIGATORS A cloud is cast about me &amp; the spell Of evil tongues gloom round me like a hell &amp; shall their falshoods triumph &amp; shall I See fames sun wither in its summer sky If so so be it—the eternal doom of wrath &amp; vengance on my side shall come &amp; for the truths compared to lies though few Fate give them credit—hell should have its due &amp; for their lies in numberless array That eat the heart hopes of my fame away Time curse them with the curses of thy powers Till pains eternitys grow out of hours &amp; hell itself in anguish so untried Cries out time spare them—hell is satisfied Yet spare their memories like a thunder sky Wrap them in living flames &amp; never let them die INSECTS Thou tiney loiterer on the barleys beard &amp; happy unit of a numerous herd Of playfellows the laughing summer brings Mocking the sunshine in their glittering wings How merrily they creep &amp; run &amp; flye No kin they bear to labours drudgery Smoothing the velvet of the pale hedge rose &amp; where they flye for dinner no one knows The dewdrops feed them not—they love the shine Of noon whose sun may bring them golden wine All day theyre playing in their sunday dress Till night goes sleep &amp; they can do no less Then in the heath bells silken hood they flie &amp; like to princes in their slumber lie From coming night &amp; dropping dews &amp; all In silken beds &amp; roomy painted hall So happily they spend their summer day Now in the cornfields now the new mown hay One almost fancys that such happy things In coloured hoods &amp; richly burnished wings Are fairy folk in splendid masquerade Disguised through fear of mortal folk affraid Keeping their merry pranks a mystery still Lest glaring day should do their secrets ill OLD FEELINGS It did delight me—&amp; delights me still To make a summer seat upon a hill Shielded from sun &amp; wind by little bush To list the song &amp; not to start the thrush Then rested down a pleasant path to roam Through fields where peace is never found from home &amp; woods where woodbines dangle in the boughs Daring the boys to reach them tending cows Who often aided by a treacherous stile Climb &amp; destroy them in their idle toil Dragging them down &amp; spoiling hedgrow bowers Singing more loud when they possess the flowers &amp; roads where clover bottles swarm full blown Both red &amp; white as thick as they were sown Round which the bees go buzzing with delight Following rich joy thats never out of sight Then mark a clump of sheep &amp; bye &amp; bye A brindled cow among the rushes lie Now fresh ploughed lands seen through the gappy lane Where peeps the spire that beckons home again While oer the wooden brig that sturts supprise A footstep hastens &amp; a morehen flies &amp; then a tripping maiden skips the stiles Who speaks in blushes &amp; represses smiles So sweet—one turns half round to look agen To see if she be handsome fair or plain &amp; if she be a woman in her mind She must be fair—&amp; though a savage kind &amp; thus we turn to praise—who questions why Ask thine own heart when beauty passes bye BUSHY CLOSE There is a thicket of familiar face A little thicket green on summers morn Soon as the largest—tis a quiet place Thick set with foulroyce privet &amp; blackthorn So thickly set that birdboys cannot trace Its mysterys or climb its little trees Unless they creep upon their hands &amp; knees As I have crept full many hours away To hunt for nests &amp; wood flowers—for in these My boyish heart was living—woods &amp; vales Made up my being—all the live long May When leisure left me did I list the tales Of shepherds &amp; go nesting far away &amp; in this little spot the nightingales Did sing so many all the night &amp; day I thought that all did to this thicket come &amp; on through mossy roots so eager on I crept—the fox rushed up &amp; left his lair The first time danger seemed so near his home But as for nightingales there seemed not one All stopt their song as if no bird was there &amp; when I left my teazing search as vain They teazed me with their singing all again &amp; for the sake of feelings witnessed then I often in the summer morning fare To see that little “bushy close” agen &amp; walk its little riding full of sloughs &amp; elting footmarks of the pastoral cows Who through the hedges broken gaps intrude &amp; in the woodlands browze in happy mood Seeming as they themselves loved melody &amp; the sweet woodland shadows well as me So in these spots that memory makes divine I dream of happiness &amp; call it mine THE MOORHENS NEST O poesys power thou overpowering sweet That renders hearts that love thee all unmeet For this rude world its trouble &amp; its care Loading the heart with joys it cannot bear That warms &amp; chills &amp; burns &amp; bursts at last Oer broken hopes &amp; troubles never past I pay thee worship at a rustic shrine &amp; dream oer joys I still imagine mine I pick up flowers &amp; pebbles &amp; by thee As gems &amp; jewels they appear to me I pick out pictures round the fields that lie In my minds heart like things that cannot die Like picking hopes &amp; making friends with all Yet glass will often bear a harder fall As bursting bottles loose the precious wine Hopes casket breaks &amp; I the gems resign Pain shadows on till feelings self decays &amp; all such pleasures leave me is their praise &amp; thus each fairy vision melts away Like evening landscapes from the face of day Till hope returns with aprils dewy reign &amp; then I start &amp; seek for joys again &amp; pick her fragments up to hurd anew Like fancy-riches pleasure loves to view &amp; these associations of the past Like summer pictures in a winter blast Renews my heart to feelings as the rain Falls on the earth &amp; bids it thrive again Then een the fallow fields appear so fair The very weeds make sweetest gardens there &amp; summer there puts garments on so gay I hate the plough that comes to dissaray Her holiday delights—&amp; labours toil Seems vulgar curses on the sunny soil &amp; man the only object that distrains Earths garden into deserts for his gains Leave him his schemes of gain—tis wealth to me Wild heaths to trace—&amp; note their broken tree Which lightening shivered—&amp; which nature tries To keep alive for poesy to prize Upon whose mossy roots my leisure sits To hear the birds pipe oer their amorous fits Though less beloved for singing then the taste They have to choose such homes upon the waste Rich architects—&amp; then the spots to see How picturesque their dwellings make them be The wild romances of the poets mind No sweeter pictures for their tales can find &amp; so I glad my heart &amp; rove along Now finding nests—then listening to a song Then drinking fragrance whose perfuming cheats Tinges lifes sours &amp; bitters into sweets That heart stirred fragrance when the summers rain Lays the road dust &amp; sprouts the grass again Filling the cracks up on the beaten paths &amp; breathing insence from the mowers swaths Insence the bards &amp; prophets of old days Met in the wilderness to glad their praise &amp; in these summer walks I seem to feel These bible pictures in their essence steal Around me—&amp; the ancientness of joy Breath from the woods till pleasures even cloy Yet holy breathing manna seemly falls With angel answers if a trouble calls &amp; then I walk &amp; swing my stick for joy &amp; catch at little pictures passing bye A gate whose posts are two old dotterel trees A close with molehills sprinkled oer its leas A little footbrig with its crossing rail A wood gap stopt with ivy wreathing pale A crooked stile each path crossed spinny owns A brooklet forded by its stepping stones A wood bank mined with rabbit holes—&amp; then An old oak leaning oer a badgers den Whose cave mouth enters neath the twisted charms Of its old roots &amp; keeps it safe from harms Pickaxes spades &amp; all its strength confounds When hunted foxes hide from chasing hounds —Then comes the meadows where I love to see A floodwashed bank support an aged tree Whose roots are bare—yet some with foothold good Crankle &amp; spread &amp; strike beneath the flood Yet still its leans as safer hold to win On tother side &amp; seems as tumbling in While every summer finds it green &amp; gay &amp; winter leaves it safe as did the may Nor does the morehen find its safety vain For on its roots their last years homes remain &amp; once again a couple from the brood Seek their old birth place &amp; in safetys mood Lodge there their flags &amp; lay—though danger comes It dares &amp; tries &amp; cannot reach their homes &amp; so they hatch their eggs &amp; sweetly dream On their shelfed nests that bridge the gulphy stream &amp; soon the sutty brood from fear elopes Where bulrush forrests give them sweeter hopes Their hanging nest that aids their wishes well Each leaves for water as it leaves the shell &amp; dive &amp; dare &amp; every gambol trie Till they themselves to other scenes can fly PEWITS NEST Accross the fallow clods at early morn I took a random track where scant &amp; spare The grass &amp; nibbled leaves all closely shorn Leaves a burnt flat all bleaching brown &amp; bare Where hungry sheep in freedom range forlorn &amp; neath the leaning willow &amp; odd thorn &amp; molehill large that vagrant shade supplies They batter round to shun the teazing flies Trampling smooth places hard as cottage floors Where the time-killing lonly shepherd boys Whose summer homes are ever out of doors Their chockholes form &amp; chalk their marble ring &amp; make their clay taws at the bubbling spring &amp; in their rangling sport &amp; gambling joys They straine their clocklike shadows—when it cloys To guess the hour that slowly runs away &amp; shorten sultry turmoil with their play Here did I roam while veering overhead The Pewet whirred in many whewing rings &amp; “chewsit” screamed &amp; clapped her flapping wings To hunt her nest my rambling steps was led Oer the broad baulk beset with little hills By moles long formed &amp; pismires tennanted As likely spots—but still I searched in vain When all at once the noisey birds were still &amp; on the lands a furrowed ridge between Chance found four eggs of dingy dirty green Deep blotched with plashy spots of jockolate stain Their small ends inward turned as ever found As though some curious hand had laid them round Yet lying on the ground with nought at all Of soft grass withered twitch &amp; bleached weed To keep them from the rain storms frequent fall &amp; here she broods on her unsavory bed When bye &amp; bye with little care &amp; heed Her young with each a shell upon its head Run after their wild parents restless cry &amp; from their own fears tiney shadows run Neath clods &amp; stones to cringe &amp; snugly lie Hid from all sight but the all seeing sun Till never ceasing danger seemeth bye THE YELLOW WAGTAILS NEST Upon an edding in a quiet nook We double down choice places in a book &amp; this I noted as a pleasant scene Hemmed in all round with barleys juicey green While in its clover grass at holiday A broken plough as leisures partner lay A pleasant bench among the grass &amp; flowers For merry weeders in their dinner hours From fallow fields released &amp; hot turmoil It nestled like a thought forgot by toil &amp; seemed so picturesque a place for rest I een dropt down to be a minutes guest &amp; as I bent me for a flower to stoop A little bird cheeped loud &amp; fluttered up The grasses tottered with their husky seeds That ramped beside the plough with ranker weeds I looked—&amp; there a snug nest deep &amp; dry Of roots &amp; twitches entertained my eye &amp; six eggs sprinkled oer with spots of grey Lay snug as comforts wishes ever lay The yellow wagtail fixed its dwelling there Sheltered from rainfalls by the shelving share That leaned above it like a sheltering roof From rain &amp; wind &amp; tempest comfort proof Such safety-places little birds will find Far from the cares &amp; help of human kind For nature is their kind protector still To chuse their dwellings furthest off from ill So thought I—sitting on that broken plough While evenings sunshine gleamed upon my brow So soft so sweet—&amp; I so happy then Felt life still eden from the haunts of men &amp; in the brook-pond waters spread below Where misty willows wavered too &amp; fro The setting sun shed such a golden hue I almost felt the poets fables true &amp; fashioned in my minds creating eye Dryads &amp; nymphs like beautys dreams go bye From the rich arbours of the distant wood To taste the spring &amp; try its golden flood Thus pleasures to the fancy often shine Truest when false when fables most divine &amp; though each sweet consception soon decays We feel such pleasures after many days TO ???? ON NEWYEARS DAY A new years welcome lovely maid Awakes the poets song Be not of moral truths afraid Nor deem the lesson wrong Though newyears still their welcomes bring &amp; hails thy blooming hour &amp; on the green lap of the spring Leaves thee its fairest flower The withered year had youth &amp; pride As thy unclouded joy But the today though deified To morrow shall destroy &amp; sweet as is thy lovely bloom Of mingled white &amp; red A days in waiting yet to come Shall find that beauty fled Bind not thy heart to things so frail A worshipher of pride Let choice of better things prevail &amp; meaner ones deride As fair as is that lovely bloom Thy witching youth puts on A frowning year is yet to come Shall find its blossom gone The withered year saw many flowers As fair as thou art seen That now are lost to suns &amp; showers With blossoms that have been Then live from pride &amp; folly free &amp; wear an angels bosom &amp; when the last new year shall be Live an unfading blossom ON SEEING A BEAUTIFUL STATUE Thou lovely shade of heavenly birth Aught else thou cannot be The copy of the loves on earth Were never types of thee Where is the face can looks impart So heavenly born as thine Rude nature tamed with studied art Owns nothing so divine Thou type of beautys reigning flower To form thee thus was given A soul that spurned at earthly power &amp; grasped the fire of heaven Of faded Greece the Goddess still Formed from eternity T'were hard to deem it heathen-ill To worship such as thee For love might yet with bended knee Urge its promethian prayer &amp; worship in its extacy The soul thought kindles there Beautys the type of heaven above Where sinless praise is given Nor is it vain for earth to love Aught that resembles heaven THE FLITTING Ive left mine own old home of homes Green fields &amp; every pleasant place The summer like a stranger comes I pause &amp; hardly know her face I miss the hazels happy green The bluebells quiet hanging blooms Where envys sneer was never seen Where staring malice never comes I miss the heath its yellow furze Molehills &amp; rabbit tracts that lead Through beesom ling &amp; teazle burrs That spread a wilderness indeed The woodland oaks &amp; all below That their white powdered branches shield The mossy paths—the very crow Croaks music in my native field I sit me in my corner chair That seems to feel itself from home &amp; hear bird-music here &amp; there From awthorn hedge &amp; orchard come I hear but all is strange &amp; new —I sat on my old bench in June The sailing puddocks shrill “peelew” Oer royce wood seemed a sweeter tune I walk adown the narrow lane The nightingale is singing now But like to me she seems at loss For royce wood &amp; its shielding bough I lean upon the window sill The trees &amp; summer happy seem Green sunny green they shine—but still My heart goes far away to dream Of happiness &amp; thoughts arise With home bred pictures many a one Green lanes that shut out burning skies &amp; old crooked stiles to rest upon Above them hangs the maple tree Below grass swells a velvet hill &amp; little footpaths sweet to see Goes seeking sweeter places still With bye &amp; bye a brook to cross Oer which a little arch is thrown No brook is here I feel the loss From home &amp; friends &amp; all alone —The stone pit with its shelvy sides Seemed hanging rocks in my esteem I miss the prospect far &amp; wide From Langley bush &amp; so I seem Alone &amp; in a stranger scene Far far from spots my heart esteems The closen with their ancient green Heaths woods &amp; pastures sunny streams The awthorns here were hung with may But still they seem in deader green The sun een seems to loose its way Nor knows the quarter it is in I dwell on trifles like a child I feel as ill becomes a man &amp; still my thoughts like weedlings wild Grow up to blossom where they can They turn to places known so long &amp; feel that joy was dwelling there So home fed pleasures fill the song That has no present joys to heir I read in books for happiness But books are like the sea to joy They change—as well give age the glass To hunt its visage when a boy For books they follow fashions new &amp; throw all old esteems away In crowded streets flowers never grew But many there hath died away Some sing the pomps of chivalry As legends of the ancient time Where gold &amp; pearls &amp; mystery Are shadows painted for sublime But passions of sublimity Belong to plain &amp; simpler things &amp; David underneath a tree Sought when a shepherd Salems springs Where moss did into cushions spring Forming a seat of velvet hue A small unnoticed trifling thing To all but heavens hailing dew &amp; Davids crown hath passed away Yet poesy breaths his shepherd skill His palace lost—&amp; to this day The little moss is blooming still Strange scenes mere shadows are to me Vague unpersonifying things I love with my old home to be By quiet woods &amp; gravel springs Where little pebbles wear as smooth As hermits beads by gentle floods Whose noises doth my spirits sooth &amp; warms them into singing moods Here every tree is strange to me All foreign things where eer I go Theres none where boyhood made a swee Or clambered up to rob a crow No hollow tree or woodland bower Well known when joy was beating high Where beauty ran to shun a shower &amp; love took pains to keep her dry &amp; laid the shoaf upon the ground To keep her from the dripping grass &amp; ran for stowks &amp; set them round Till scarce a drop of rain could pass Through—where the maidens they reclined &amp; sung sweet ballads now forgot Which brought sweet memorys to the mind But here no memory knows them not There have I sat by many a tree &amp; leaned oer many a rural stile &amp; conned my thoughts as joys to me Nought heeding who might frown or smile Twas natures beauty that inspired My heart with raptures not its own &amp; shes a fame that never tires How could I feel myself alone No—pasture molehills used to lie &amp; talk to me of sunny days &amp; then the glad sheep resting bye All still in ruminating praise Of summer &amp; the pleasant place &amp; every weed &amp; blossom too Was looking upward in my face With friendship welcome “how do ye do” All tennants of an ancient place &amp; heirs of noble heritage Coeval they with adams race &amp; blest with more substantial age For when the world first saw the sun There little flowers beheld him too &amp; when his love for earth begun They were the first his smiles to woo There little lambtoe bunches springs In red tinged &amp; begolden dye For ever &amp; like china kings They come but never seem to die There may-blooms with its little threads Still comes upon the thorny bowers &amp; neer forgets those pinky threads Like fairy pins amid the flowers &amp; still they bloom as on the day They first crowned wilderness &amp; rock When abel haply crowned with may The firstlings of his little flock &amp; Eve might from the matted thorn To deck her lone &amp; lovely brow Reach that same rose the heedless scorn Misnames as the dog rosey now Give me no highflown fangled things No haughty pomp in marching chime Where muses play on golden strings &amp; splendour passes for sublime Where citys stretch as far as fame &amp; fancys straining eye can go &amp; piled untill the sky for shame Is stooping far away below I love the verse that mild &amp; bland Breaths of green fields &amp; open sky I love the muse that in her hand Bears wreaths of native poesy Who walks nor skips the pasture brook In scorn—but by the drinking horse Leans oer its little brig to look How far the sallows lean accross &amp; feels a rapture in her breast Upon their root-fringed grains to mark A hermit morehens sedgy nest Just like a naiads summer bark She counts the eggs she cannot reach Admires the spot &amp; loves it well &amp; yearns so natures lessons teach Amid such neighbourhoods to dwell I love the muse who sits her down Upon the molehills little lap Who feels no fear to stain her gown &amp; pauses by the hedgrow gap Not with that affectation praise Of song to sing &amp; never see A field flower grow in all her days Or een a forests aged tree Een here my simple feelings nurse A love for every simple weed &amp; een this little “shepherds purse” Grieves me to cut it up—Indeed I feel at times a love &amp; joy For every weed &amp; every thing A feeling kindred from a boy A feeling brought with every spring &amp; why—this “shepherds purse” that grows In this strange spot—In days gone bye Grew in the little garden rows Of my old home now left—And I Feel what I never felt before This weed an ancient neighbour here &amp; though I own the spot no more Its every trifle makes it dear The Ivy at the parlour end The woodbine at the garden gate Are all &amp; each affections friend That rendered parting desolate But times will change &amp; friends must part &amp; nature still can make amends Their memory lingers round the heart Like life whose essence is its friends Time looks on pomp with careless moods Or killing apathys disdain —So where old marble citys stood Poor persecuted weeds remain She feels a love for little things That very few can feel beside &amp; still the grass eternal springs Where castles stood &amp; grandeur died THE SUMMER GONE The summer she is gone her book is shut That did my idle leisure so engage Her pictures were so many—some I put On memorys scroll—Of some I turned the page Adown for pleasures after heritage But I have stayed too long—&amp; she is gone Decay her stormy strife begins to wage Scenes flit &amp; change &amp; new scenes hurry on Till winters hungry maw shall gorge them every one The cleanly maiden down the village streets In pattens clicks oer causways never dry While eves drop on her cap—&amp; oft she meets The laughing urchin with mischevious eye Who tryes to plash her as she hurrys bye The swains afield right early seek their ploughs &amp; to the maids right vulgar speech applies Yet gentler shepherd pleads &amp; she alows His proffered aid to help her over sloughs The hedger soaked with the dull weather chops On at his toils which scarcely keep him warm At every stroke he takes—large swarms of drops Patter about him like an april storm The sticking dame with cloak upon her arm To guard against the storm—walks the wet leas Of willow groves—or hedges round the farms Picking up aught her splashy wandering sees Een withered kecks—&amp; sticks winds shake from off the trees Boys often clamber up a sweeing tree To see the scarlet hunter hurry bye &amp; fain would in their merry uproar be But sullen labour hath its tethering tie Crows swop around &amp; some on bushes nigh Watch for a chance when eer he turns away To settle down their hunger to supply From morn to eve bird scaring claims his stay Save now &amp; then an hour which leisure steals for play Gaunt greyhounds now the coursers sports impart With long legs stretched on tiptoe for the chace &amp; short loose ear &amp; eye upon the start swift as the winds their motions they unlace When bobs the hare up from her hiding place Who in its furry coat of fallow stain Squats on the lands or with a dodging pace Trys its old coverts of wood grass to gain &amp; oft by cunning ways makes all their speed in vain The pigeon with its breast of many hues That spangles to the sun—turns round &amp; round About his timid paramour &amp; coos Upon the cottage ridge—while oer them wews The puddock &amp; below the clocking hen Calls loud her chickens out of dangers way That skulk &amp; scuttle neath her wings agen Nor peeps again till dangers far away &amp; one bye one they peep &amp; hardly dare to stray So summer went &amp; so the autumn goes Hedge orchard wood to red &amp; yellow turn The lark becrowding field a desert grows The brooks that sung do nothing else but mourn For company—there long necked cranes sojourn Unstartled by the groups that summer gave When reapers shepherds all with thirst did burn &amp; thronged its stream—aye life need little crave For such will winter be in the unnoticed grave THE PROGRESS OF RYHME O soul enchanting poesy Thoust long been all the world with me When poor [thy] presence grows my wealth When sick thy visions gives me health When sad thy sunny smile is joy &amp; was from een a tiney boy When trouble was &amp; toiling care Seemed almost more than I could bear While threshing in the dusty barn Or squashing in the ditch to earn A pittance that would scarce alow One joy to smooth my sweating brow Where drop by drop would chace &amp; fall —Thy presence triumphed over all The vulgar they might frown &amp; sneer Insult was mean but never near Twas poesys self that stopt the sigh &amp; malice met with no reply So was it in my earlier day When sheep to corn had strayed away Or horses closen gaps had broke Ere suns had peeped or I awoke My masters frowns might force the tear But poesy came to check &amp; cheer It glistened in my shamed eye But ere it fell the swoof was bye I thought of luck in future days When even he might find a praise I looked on poesy like a friend To cheer me till my life should end Twas like a parents first regard &amp; love when beautys voice was heard Twas joy twas hope &amp; maybe fear But still twas rapture everywhere My heart were ice unmoved to dwell Nor care for one I loved so well Through rough &amp; smooth through good &amp; ill That led me &amp; attends me still It was an early joy to me That joy was love &amp; poesy &amp; but for thee my idle lay Had neer been urged in early day The Harp imagination strung Had neer been dreamed of—but among The flowers in summers fields of joy I'd lain an idle rustic boy No hope to think of fear or care &amp; even love a stranger there But poesy that vision flung Around me as I hummed or sung I glowered on beauty passing bye Yet hardly turned my sheepish eye I worshiped yet could hardly dare To show I knew the goddess there Lest my presumptious stare should gain But frowns ill humour &amp; disdain My first ambition was its praise My struggles aye in early days Had I by vulgar boldness torn That hope when it was newly born By rudeness gibes &amp; vulgar tongue The curse of the unfeeling throng Their scorn had frowned upon the lay &amp; hope &amp; song had dyed away &amp; I with nothing to attone Had felt myself indeed alone But promises of days to come The very fields would seem to hum Those burning days when I should dare To sing aloud my worship there When beautys self might turn its eye Of praise—what could I do but try Twas winter then—but summers shone From heaven when I was all alone &amp; summer came &amp; every weed Of great or little had its meed Without its leaves there wa'n't a bower Nor one poor weed without its flower Twas love &amp; pleasure all along I felt that I'd a right to song &amp; sung—but in a timid strain Of fondness for my native plain For everything I felt a love The weeds below the birds above &amp; weeds that bloomed in summers hours I thought they should be reckoned flowers They made a garden free for all &amp; so I loved them great &amp; small &amp; sung of some that pleased my eye Nor could I pass the thistle bye But paused &amp; thought it could not be A weed in natures poesy No matter for protecting wall No matter though they chance to fall Where sheep &amp; cows &amp; oxen lie The kindly rain when they're adry Falls on them with as plenteous showers As when it waters garden flowers They look up with a blushing eye Upon a tender watching sky &amp; still enjoy the kindling smile Of sunshine though they live with toil As garden flowers with all their care For natures love is even there &amp; so it cheered me while I lay Among their beautiful array To think that I in humble dress Might have a right to happiness &amp; sing as well as greater men &amp; then I strung the lyre agen &amp; heartened up oer toil &amp; fear &amp; lived with rapture everywhere Till dayshine to my themes did come Just as a blossom bursts to bloom &amp; finds itself in thorny ways So did my musings meet with praise &amp; though no garden care had I My heart had love for poesy A simple love a wild esteem As heartfelt as the linnets dream That mutters in its sleep at night Some notes from extacys delight Thus did I dream oer joys &amp; lie Muttering dream-songs of poesy —The night dislimned &amp; waking day Shook from wood leaves the drops away Hope came—storms calmed—&amp; hue &amp; cry With her false pictures herded bye With tales of help when help was not Of friends who urged to write or blot Whose taste were such that mine were shame Had they not helped it into fame Poh—let the idle rumour ill Their vanity is never still My harp though simple was my own When I was in the fields alone With none to help &amp; none to hear To bid me either hope or fear The bird &amp; bee its chords would sound The air hummed melodys around I cought with eager ear the strain &amp; sung the music oer again Or love or instinct flowing strong Fields were the essence of the song &amp; fields &amp; woods are still as mine Real teachers that are all divine So if my song be weak or tame Tis I not they who bear the blame But hope &amp; cheer through good &amp; ill They are my aids to worship still Still growing on a gentle tide Nor foes could mar or friends could guide Like pasture brooks through sun &amp; shade Crooked as channels chance hath made It rambles as it loves to stray &amp; hope &amp; feeling leads the way —Aye birds no matter what the tune Or “croak” or “tweet”—twas natures boon That brought them joy—&amp; music flung Its spell oer every mattin sung &amp; een the sparrows chirp to me Was song in its felicity When grief hung oer me like a cloud Till hope seemed even in her shroud I whispered poesys spells till they Gleamed round me like a summers day When tempests oer my labour sung My soul to its responses rung &amp; joined the chorus till the storm Fell all unheeded void of harm &amp; each old leaning shielding tree Where princely palaces to me Where I would sit me down &amp; chime My unheard rhapsodies to ryhme All I beheld of grand—with time Grew up to beautifuls sublime The arching groves of ancient Limes That into roofs like churches climb Grain intertwisting into grain That stops the sun &amp; stops the rain &amp; spreads a gloom that never smiles Like ancient halls &amp; minster aisles While all without a beautious screen Of summers luscious leaves is seen While heard that everlasting hum Of insects haunting where they bloom As though twas natures very place Of worship where her mighty race Of insect life &amp; spirits too In summer time were wont to go Both insects &amp; the breath of flowers To sing their makers mighty powers Ive thought so as I used to rove Through burghley park that darksome grove Of Limes where twilight lingered grey Like evening in the midst of day &amp; felt without a single skill That instinct that would not be still To think of song sublime beneath That heaved my bosom like my breath That burned &amp; chilled &amp; went &amp; came Without or uttering or a name Untill the vision waked with time &amp; left me itching after ryhme Where little pictures idly tells Of natures powers &amp; natures spells I felt &amp; shunned the idle vein Laid down the pen &amp; toiled again But spite of all through good &amp; ill It was &amp; is my worship still No matter how the world approved Twas nature listened—I that loved No matter how the lyre was strung From my own heart the music sprung The cowboy with his oaten straw Although he hardly heard or saw No more of music than he made Twas sweet—&amp; when I pluckt the blade Of grass upon the woodland hill To mock the birds with artless skill No music in the world beside Seemed half so sweet—till mine was tried So my boy-worship poesy Made een the muses pleased with me Untill I even danced for joy A happy &amp; a lonely boy Each object to my ear &amp; eye Made paradise of poesy I heard the blackbird in the dell Sing sweet could I but sing as well I thought untill the bird in glee Seemed pleased &amp; paused to answer me —&amp; nightingales O I have stood Beside the pingle &amp; the wood &amp; oer the old oak railing hung To listen every note they sung &amp; left boys making taws of clay To muse &amp; listen half the day The more I listened &amp; the more Each note seemed sweeter then before &amp; aye so different was the strain She'd scarce repeat the note again —“Chew-chew chew-chew” &amp; higher still “Cheer-cheer cheer-cheer” more loud &amp; shrill “Cheer-up cheer-up cheer-up”—&amp; dropt Low “Tweet tweet jug jug jug” &amp; stopt One moment just to drink the sound Her music made &amp; then a round Of stranger witching notes was heard As if it was a stranger bird “Wew-wew wew-wew chur-chur chur-chur “Woo-it woo-it”—could this be her “Tee-rew tee-rew tee-rew tee-rew “Chew-rit chew-rit”—&amp; ever new “Will-will will-will grig-grig grig-grig” The boy stopt sudden on the brig To hear the “tweet tweet tweet” so shrill The “jug jug jug” &amp; all was still A minute—when a wilder strain Made boys &amp; woods to pause again Words were not left to hum the spell Could they be birds that sung so well— I thought &amp; may be more then I That musics self had left the sky To cheer me with its majic strain &amp; then I hummed the words again Till fancy pictured standing bye My hearts companion poesy No friends had I to guide or aid The struggles young ambition made In silent shame the harp was tried &amp; raptures guess the tune applied Yet oer the songs my parents sung My ear in silent musings hung Their kindness wishes did regard They sung &amp; joy was my reward All else was but a proud decree The right of bards &amp; nought to me A title that I dare not claim &amp; hid it like a private shame I whispered aye &amp; felt a fear To speak aloud though none was near I dreaded laughter more then blame &amp; dare not sing aloud for shame So all unheeded lone &amp; free I felt it happiness to be Unknown obscure &amp; like a tree In woodland peace &amp; privacy No not a friend on earth had I But my own kin &amp; poesy Nor wealth—&amp; yet I felt indeed As rich as anybody need To be—for health &amp; hope &amp; joy Was mine although a lonely boy &amp; what I felt—as now I sing Made friends of all &amp; everything Save man the vulgar &amp; the low The polished t'was not mine to know Who paid me in my after days &amp; gave me even more than praise Twas then I found that friends indeed Where needed when I'd less to need —The pea that independant springs— When in its blossom hails &amp; clings To every help that lingers bye &amp; I when classed with poesy Who stood unbrunt the heaviest shower Felt feeble as that very flower &amp; helpless all—but beautys smile Is harvest for the hardest toil Whose smiles I little thought to win With ragged coat &amp; downy chin A clownish silent haynish boy Who even felt ashamed of joy So dirty ragged &amp; so low With nought to reccomend or show That I was worthy een a smile —Had I but felt amid my toil That I in days to come should be A little light in minstrelsy &amp; in the blush of after days Win beautys smile &amp; beautys praise My heart with lonely fancy warm Had even bursted with the charm &amp; Mary thou whose very name I loved—whose look was even fame From those delicious eyes of blue In smiles &amp; rapture ever new Thy timid step thy fairy form Thy face with blushes ever warm When praise my schoolboy heart did move I saw thy blush &amp; thought it love &amp; all ambitious thee to please My heart was ever ill at ease I saw thy beauty grow with days &amp; tried song-pictures in thy praise &amp; all of fair or beautiful Where thine akin—nor could I pull The blossoms that I thought divine Lest I should injure aught of thine So where they grew I let them be &amp; though I dare not look to thee Of love—to them I talked aloud &amp; grew ambitious from the crowd With hopes that I should one day be Beloved Mary een by thee But I mistook in early day The world—&amp; so our hopes decay Yet that same cheer in after toils Was poesy—&amp; still she smiles As sweet as blossoms to the tree &amp; hope love joy are poesy THE ENTHUSIAST A DAY DREAM IN SUMMER “Daydreams of summers gone[”] White Wearied with his lonely walk Hermit like with none to talk &amp; cloyed with often seen delight His spirits sickened at the sight Of lifes realitys &amp; things That spread around his wanderings Of wood &amp; heath in brambles clad That seemed like him in silence sad The lone enthusiast weary worn Sought shelter from the heats of morn &amp; in a cool nook by the stream Beside the bridge wall dreamed a dream &amp; instant from his half closed eye Reality seemed fading bye Dull fields &amp; woods that round him lay Like curtains to his dreaming play All slided by &amp; on his sight New scenes appeared in fairy light The skys lit up a fairer sun The birds a cheery song begun &amp; flowers bloomed fair &amp; wildly round As ever grew on dreaming ground &amp; mid the sweet enchanting view Created every minute new He swooned at once from care &amp; strife Into the poesy of life A stranger to the thoughts of men He felt his boyish limbs again Revelling in all the glee Of lifes first fairy infancy Chasing by the rippling spring Dragon flyes of purple wing Or setting mushroom-tops afloat Mimmicing the sailing boat Or vainly trying by supprise To catch the settling butterflyes &amp; oft with rapture driving on Where many partner boys had gone Wading through the rustling wheat Red &amp; purple flowers to meet To weave &amp; trim a wild cockade &amp; play the soldiers gay parade Then searched the ivy haunted dell To seek the pootys painted shell &amp; scaled the trees with burning breast Mid scolding crows to rob their nest Heart bursting with unshackled joys The only heritage of boys That from the haunts of manhood flye Like song birds from a winter sky &amp; now tore through the clinging thorns Seeking kecks for bugle horns Thus with the schoolboys heart again He chased &amp; halooed oer the plain Till the old church clock counted one &amp; told us freedoms hour was gone In its dull humming drowsy way It called us from our sports &amp; play How different did the sound appear To that which brought the evening near That lovely humming happy strain That brought them liberty again —The desk the books were all the same Marked with each well known little name &amp; many a cover blotched &amp; blurred With shapless forms of beast &amp; bird &amp; the old master white with years Sat there to waken boyish fears While the tough scepter of his sway That awed to silence all the day The peeled wand acting to his will Hung oer the smoak stained chimney still —The church yard still its trees possest &amp; jackdaws sought their ancient nest In whose old trunks they did acquire Homes safe as in the mossy spire The school they shadowed as before With its white dial oer the door &amp; bees hummed round in summers pride In its time-crevised walls to hide The gravestones childhood eager reads Peeped oer the rudely clambering weeds Where cherubs gilt [that] represent The slumbers of the innoscent Smiled glittering to the slanting sun As if deaths peace with heaven was won All all was blest &amp; peace &amp; plays Brought back the enthusiasts fairy days &amp; leaving childhood unpercieved Scenes sweeter still his dream relieved Lifes calmest spot that lingers green Manhood &amp; infancy between When youths warm feelings have their birth Creating angels upon earth &amp; fancying woman born for joy With nought to wither &amp; destroy That picture of past youths delight Was swimming now before his sight &amp; loves soft thrills of pleasant pain Was whispering its deciets again &amp; Mary pride of pleasures gone Was at his side to lead him on &amp; on they went through field &amp; lane Haunts of their loves to trace again Clung to his arm she skipt along With the same music on her tongue The self-same voice as soft &amp; dear As that which met his youthful ear The sunny look the witching grace Still blushed upon her angel face As though one moments harmless stay Had never stole a charm away That self-same bloom &amp; in her eye That blue of thirteen summers bye She took his hand to climb the stiles &amp; looked as wont her winning smiles &amp; as he met her looks divine More tender did their blushes shine Her small hand pressed within his own Thrilled pleasures life hath never known His heart beat as it once had done &amp; felt as love had just begun As they'd neer told their minds before Or parted long to meet no more The pleasant spots where they had met All shone as nought had faded yet The sun was setting oer the hill The thorn bush it was blooming still As it was blooming on the day When last he reached her boughs of may &amp; pleased he clumb the thorny grain To crop its firstling buds again &amp; claimed in eager extacys Loves favours as he reached the prize Marking her hearts uneasy rest The while he placed them on her breast &amp; felt warm loves oerbounding thrill That it could beat so tender still &amp; all her artless winning ways Where with her as of other days Her fears such fondness to reveal Her wishes struggling to consceal Her cheeks loves same warm blushes burned &amp; smiled when he its warmth returned O he did feel as he had done When Marys bosom first was won &amp; gazed upon her eyes of blue &amp; blest her tenderly &amp; true As she sat by his side to rest Feeling as then that he was blest The talk the whisper met his ears The same sweet tales of other years That as they sat or mused along Melted like music from her tongue Objects of summer all the same Where nigh her gentle praise to claim The lark was rising from his nest To sing the setting sun to rest &amp; her fair hand was oer her eyes To see her favourite in the skies &amp; oft his look was turned to see If love still felt that melody &amp; blooming flowers were at her feet Her bending lovely looks to meet The blooms of spring &amp; summer days Lingering as to wait her praise &amp; though she showed him weeds the while He praised &amp; loved them for a smile The cuckoo sung in soft delight Its ditty to departing light &amp; murmuring childern far away Mockt the music in their play &amp; in the ivied tree the dove Breathed its soothing song to love &amp; as her praise she did renew He smiled and hoped her heart as true She blushed away in maiden pride Then nestled closer to his side He loved to watch her wistful look Following white moths down the brook &amp; thrilled to mark her beaming eyes Brightening in pleasure &amp; supprise To meet the wild mysterious things That evenings soothing presence brings &amp; stepping [on] with gentle feet She strove to shun the larks retreat &amp; as he near the bushes prest &amp; scared the linnet from its nest Fond chidings from her bosom fell Then blessed the bird &amp; wished it well His heart was into rapture stirred His very soul was with the bird He felt that blessing by her side As only to himself applied Tis womans love makes earth divine &amp; life its rudest cares resign &amp; in his raptures gushing whim He told her it was meant for him She neer denied but looked the will To own as though she blest him still Yet he had fearful thoughts in view Joy seemed too happy to be true He doubted if twas Mary bye Yet could not feel the reason why He loitered by her as in pain &amp; longed to hear her voice again &amp; called her by her witching name She answered—twas the very same &amp; looked as if she knew his fears Smiling to cheer him through her tears &amp; whispering in a tender sigh “Tis youth &amp; Mary standing bye” His heart revived yet in its mirth Felt fears that they were not of earth That all were shadows of the mind Picturing the joys it wished to find Yet he did feel as like a child &amp; sighed in fondness till she smiled Vowing they neer would part no more &amp; act so foolish as before She nestled closer by his side &amp; vowed “we never will” &amp; sighed He grasped her hand it seemed to thrill &amp; whispered “no we never will” &amp; thought in raptures mad extream To hold her though it proved a dream &amp; instant as that thought begun Her presence seemed his love to shun &amp; deaf to all he had to say Quick turned her [tender] face away When her small waist he strove to clasp She shrunk like water from his grasp He woke—all lonely as before He sat beside the rilling streams &amp; felt that aching joy once more Akin to thought &amp; pleasant dreams THE YELLOWHAMMERS NEST Just by the wooden brig a bird flew up Frit by the cowboy as he scrambled down To reach the misty dewberry—let us stoop &amp; seek its nest—the brook we need not dread Tis scarcely deep enough a bee to drown So it sings harmless oer its pebbly bed —Aye here it is stuck close beside the bank Beneath the bunch of grass that spindles rank Its husk seeds tall &amp; high—tis rudely planned Of bleached stubbles &amp; the withered fare That last years harvest left upon the land Lined thinly with the horses sable hair —Five eggs pen-scribbled over lilac shells Resembling writing scrawls which fancy reads As natures poesy &amp; pastoral spells They are the yellowhammers &amp; she dwells A poet-like—where brooks &amp; flowery weeds As sweet as Castaly to fancy seems &amp; that old molehill like as parnass hill On which her partner haply sits &amp; dreams Oer all his joy of song—so leave it still A happy home of sunshine flowers &amp; streams Yet in the sweetest places cometh ill A noisome weed that burthens every soil For snakes are known with chill &amp; deadly coil To watch such nests &amp; seize the helpless young &amp; like as though the plague became a guest Leaving a housless home a ruined nest &amp; mournful hath the little warblers sung When such like woes hath rent its little breast THE PETTICHAPS NEST Well in my many walks I rarely found A place less likely for a bird to form Its nest close by the rut gulled waggon road &amp; on the almost bare foot-trodden ground With scarce a clump of grass to keep it warm &amp; not a thistle spreads its spears abroad Or prickly bush to shield it from harms way &amp; yet so snugly made that none may spy It out save accident—&amp; you &amp; I Had surely passed it on our walk to day Had chance not led us by it—nay e'en now Had not the old bird heard us trampling bye &amp; fluttered out—we had not seen it lie Brown as the roadway side—small bits of hay Pluckt from the old propt-haystacks pleachy brow &amp; withered leaves make up its outward walls That from the snub-oak dotterel yearly falls &amp; in the old hedge bottom rot away Built like a oven with a little hole Hard to discover—that snug entrance wins Scarcely admitting e'en two fingers in &amp; lined with feathers warm as silken stole &amp; soft as seats of down for painless ease &amp; full of eggs scarce bigger e'en then peas Heres one most delicate with spots as small As dust—&amp; of a faint &amp; pinky red —We'll let them be &amp; safety guard them well For fears rude paths around are thickly spread &amp; they are left to many dangers ways When green grass hoppers jump might break the shells While lowing oxen pass them morn &amp; night &amp; restless sheep around them hourly stray &amp; no grass springs but hungry horses bite That trample past them twenty times a day Yet like a miracle in safetys lap They still abide unhurt &amp; out of sight —Stop heres the bird that woodman at the gap Hath put it from the hedge—tis olive green Well I declare it is the pettichaps Not bigger than the wren &amp; seldom seen Ive often found their nests in chances way When I in pathless woods did idly roam But never did I dream untill to day A spot like this would be her chosen home THE WILD BULL Upon the common in a motely plight Horses &amp; cows claim equal common right Who in their freedom learn mischiveous ways &amp; driveth boys who thither nesting strays &amp; schoolboys leave their path in vain to find A nest—when quickly on the threatening wind The noisey bull lets terror out of doors To chase intruders from the cowslap moores &amp; though a thousand blooms where he runs on He dare not in his terror stoop for one &amp; when they see the urchins run away Will toss the ground like savages at play The schoolboy runs &amp; whines &amp; pants for breath Like fear heart bursting from the chase of death &amp; though the hedge he tears for safetys lap While the bull roars on t'other side the gap He sees a nest but dare not stop to see If eggs or birds within the dwelling be —E'en skewish poneys show their teeth &amp; kick If leisure stirs a hand or bears a stick &amp; at the pointed fingure scream &amp; run Till mischiefs self the danger's forced to shun &amp; birds are all that whistle where they come The[y] bite the bush but never hurt their home &amp; if a larks nest happens where they stray They'll snuff't—&amp; sturt—&amp; turn another way So birds are all that make such neighbours friends &amp; for such faith snug safety makes amends There on a dotterel oak from year to year The magpie builds her dwelling void of fear Which danger guards around—&amp; daring boys Are seldom found to mar her quiet joys For though tis easy clomb &amp; far from high Here many a year she trains her broods to flye &amp; there upon the awthorn easy seen The linnet builds in plumage half as green Yet safe she lives as in a pathless wood &amp; lays her eggs &amp; rears her little brood Till from the nest they flye—at ease reclined On some projecting branches while the wind Fans by the feathers of each downy breast As soft as slumbers whispers into rest While the hoarse bull lord of the pasture reigns &amp; lives like terror on the rushy plains &amp; there as soon as pleasure seeking boys Hear the hoarse noise they startle from their joys Drop down the rushes which they pulled to tie The cowslip bunsh &amp; leave the nest to flye For safer scenes where they at peace can find Their nests &amp; flowers &amp; leave their fears behind Reading made easy such life pictures own That still delight from pleasures they have known I read such little books at leisures will &amp; joy though broken feels the picture still I still look oer the cuts of boys at play Among old hugh tree trunks or meadow hay &amp; read me of bird nesters bursting full Of terror running from a roaring bull &amp; feel delight as boys with joy can be To see him safety-pictured on a tree Upon whose top he hides—while at its foot The bulls bent head tears at each stubborn root &amp; then to read the reading just to see How safety led the climber from the tree &amp; how the bull rage-weary went away &amp; left his prisoner pining after play Who crept from grain to grain—&amp; ventured down &amp; ran like lightening to the very town &amp; told on corner stool his dangers oer &amp; heard his parents cautions—never more To hurt young birds or venture in the way Of firey bulls but stay at home to play &amp; in my stolen walks on after years The wild bulls dangers murmured in my ears &amp; now I feel by safetys side a joy From memorys fears—delightful as a boy THE SKY LARK The rolls &amp; harrows lie at rest beside The battered road &amp; spreading far &amp; wide Above the russet clods the corn is seen Sprouting its spirey points of tender green Where squats the hare to terrors wide awake Like some brown clod the harrows failed to break While neath the warm hedge boys stray far from home To crop the early blossoms as they come Where buttercups will make them eager run Opening their golden caskets to the sun To see who shall be first to pluck the prize &amp; from their hurry up the skylark flies &amp; oer her half formed nest with happy wings Winnows the air—till in the clouds she sings Then hangs a dust spot in the sunny skies &amp; drops &amp; drops till in her nest she lies Where boys unheeding past—neer dreaming then That birds which flew so high—would drop agen To nests upon the ground where any thing May come at to destroy had they the wing Like such a bird themselves would be too proud &amp; build on nothing but a passing cloud As free from danger as the heavens are free From pain &amp; toil—there would they build &amp; be &amp; sail about the world to scenes unheard Of &amp; unseen—O where they but a bird So think they while they listen to its song &amp; smile &amp; fancy &amp; so pass along While its low nest moist with the dews of morn Lye safely with the leveret in the corn THE EVENING STAR How blest Ive felt on summer eves When resting on a stile Half hid in hazels moistening leaves So weary after toil &amp; gazing on the evening star That shed its ruddy light Like joys which somthing came to mar Retreating out of sight Oer the wood corners somber brown The lamp of dewy eve No sooner up then sloping down Seemed always taking leave Yet tis a lovely sight to see &amp; beautiful the time It shines in heavens canophy As evenings gentle prime Akin to images &amp; things That glad the quiet mind A calmness oer the heart it flings That poets love to find It shines oer sheep within the fold Oer shepherds whistling home The plough lies in the fallow mould The horse is free to roam Tis welcome to the weary breast It sweetens lifes employ It sees the labourer to his rest The lover to his joy The wanderer seeks his easy chair The light is in his cot His evening star is shining there &amp; troubles are forgot It looks on many a happy place Where lovers steal to meet It gilds the milkmaids ruddy face While on her rustic seat Upon the old tree in the glen That by the hovel lay The shepherd he had set the pen &amp; whistled on his way It shines oer many a whispered pledge By fondness told again In cowsheds by the woodland hedge Neath awthorns by the lane It brings the balm to summer nights Like insense from afar &amp; every musing mind delights To see the evening star THE ETERNITY OF NATURE Leaves from eternity are simple things To the worlds gaze whereto a spirit clings Sublime &amp; lasting—trampled underfoot The daisy lives &amp; strikes its little root Into the lap of time—centurys may come &amp; pass away into the silent tomb &amp; still the child hid in the womb of time Shall smile &amp; pluck them when this simple rhyme Shall be forgotten like a churchyard stone Or lingering lie unnoticed &amp; alone When eighteen hundred years our common date Grows many thousands in their marching state Aye still the child with pleasure in his eye Shall cry the daisy a familiar cry &amp; run to pluck it—in the self same state As when time found it in his infant date &amp; like a child himself when all was new Wonder might smile &amp; make him notice too —Its little golden bosom frilled with snow Might win een eve to stoop adown &amp; show Her partner Adam in the silky grass This little gem that smiled where pleasure was &amp; loving eve from eden followed ill &amp; bloomed with sorrow &amp; lives smiling still As once in eden under heavens breath So now on blighted earth &amp; on the lap of death It smiles for ever—Cowslaps golden blooms That in the closen &amp; the meadow comes Shall come when kings &amp; empires fade &amp; die &amp; in the meadows as times partners lie As fresh two thousand years to come as now With those five crimson spots upon its brow &amp; little brooks that hum a simple lay In green unnoticed spots from praise away Shall sing—when poets in times darkness hid Shall lie like memory in a pyramid Forgetting yet not all forgot though lost Like a threads end in ravelled windings crost &amp; the small humble bee shall hum as long As nightingales for time protects the song &amp; nature is their soul to whom all clings Of fair or beautiful in lasting things The little robin in the quiet glen Hidden from fame &amp; all the sons of men Sings unto time a pastoral &amp; gives A music that lives on &amp; ever lives Both spring &amp; autumn years rich bloom &amp; fade Longer then songs that poets ever made &amp; think ye these times play things pass proud skill Time loves them like a child &amp; ever will &amp; so I worship them in bushy spots &amp; sing with them when all else notice not &amp; feel the music of their mirth agree With that sooth quiet that bestirreth me &amp; if I touch aright that quiet tone That soothing truth that shadows from their own Then many a year shall grow in after days &amp; still find hearts to love my quiet lays Yet cheering mirth with thoughts sung not for fame But for the joy that with their utterance came That inward breath of rapture urged not loud —Birds singing lone flye silent past a crowd —So in these pastoral spots which childish time Makes dear to me I wander out &amp; ryhme What time the dewy mornings infancy Hangs on each blade of grass &amp; every tree &amp; sprents the red thighs of the bumble bee Who 'gins by times unwearied minstrelsy Who breakfasts dines &amp; most divinely sups With every flower save golden buttercups On their proud bosoms he will never go But passes bye with scarcely “how do ye do” So in their showy gaudy shining cells May be the summers honey never dwells —Her ways are mysterys all yet endless youth Lives in them all unchangable as truth With the odd number five strange natures laws Plays many freaks nor once mistakes the cause &amp; in the cowslap peeps this very day Five spots appear which time neer wears away Nor once mistakes the counting—look within Each peep &amp; five nor more nor less is seen &amp; trailing bindweed with its pinky cup Five lines of paler hue goes streaking up &amp; birds a many keep the rule alive &amp; lay five eggs nor more nor less then five &amp; flowers how many own that mystic power With five leaves ever making up the flower The five leaved grass trailing its golden cups Of flowers—five leaves make all for which I stoop &amp; briony in the hedge that now adorns The tree to which it clings &amp; now the thorns Own five star pointed leaves of dingy white Count which I will all make the number right &amp; spreading goosegrass trailing all abroad In leaves of silver green about the road Five leaves make every blossom all along I stoop for many none are counted wrong Tis natures wonder &amp; her makers will Who bade earth be &amp; order owns him still As that superior power who keeps the key Of wisdom power &amp; might through all eternity THE ROBINS NEST Come luscious spring come with thy mossy roots Thy weed strown banks—young grass—&amp; tender shoots Of woods new plashed sweet smells of opening blooms Sweet sunny mornings &amp; right glorious dooms Of happiness—to seek &amp; harbour in Far from the ruder worlds inglorious din Who see no glory but in sordid pelf &amp; nought of greatness but its little self Scorning the splendid gift that nature gives Where natures glory ever breaths &amp; lives Seated in crimping ferns uncurling now In russet fringes ere in leaves they bow &amp; moss as green as silk—there let me be By the grey powdered trunk of old oak tree Buried in green delights to which the heart Clings with delight &amp; beats as loath to part The birds unbid come round about to give Their music to my pleasures—wild flowers live About as if for me—they smile &amp; bloom Like uninvited guests that love to come Their wild fragrant offerings all to bring Paying me kindness like a throned king Lost in such extacys in this old spot I feel that rapture which the world hath not That joy like health that flushes in my face Amid the brambles of this ancient place Shut out from all but that superior power That guards &amp; glads &amp; cheers me every hour That wraps me like a mantle from the storm Of care &amp; bids the cold[est] hope be warm That speaks in spots where all things silent be In words not heard but felt—each ancient tree With lickens deckt—times hoary pedigree Becomes a monitor to teach &amp; bless &amp; rid me of the evils cares possess &amp; bids me look above the trivial things To which prides mecenary spirit clings The pomps the wealth &amp; artificial toys That men call wealth beleagued with strife &amp; noise To seek the silence of their ancient reign &amp; be my self in memory once again To trace the path of briar entangled holt Or bushy closen where the wanton colt Crops the young juicey leaves from off the hedge In this old wood where birds their passions pledge &amp; court &amp; build &amp; sing their under song In joys own cue that to their hearts belong Having no wish or want unreconsiled But spell bound to their homes within the wild Where old neglect lives patron &amp; befriends Their homes with safetys wildness—where nought lends A hand to injure—root up or disturb The things of this old place—there is no curb Of interest industry or slavish gain To war with nature so the weeds remain &amp; wear an ancient passion that arrays Ones feelings with the shadows of old days The rest of peace the sacredness of mind In such deep solitudes we seek &amp; find Where moss grows old &amp; keeps an evergreen &amp; footmarks seem like miracles when seen So little meddling toil doth trouble here The very weeds as patriarchs appear &amp; if a plant ones curious eyes delight In this old ancient solitude we might Come ten years hence of trouble dreaming ill &amp; find them like old tennants peaceful still Here the wood robin rustling on the leaves With fluttering step each visitor recieves Yet from his ancient home he seldom stirs In heart content on these dead teazle burs He sits [&amp;] trembles oer his under notes So rich—joy almost choaks his little throat With extacy &amp; from his own heart flows That joy himself &amp; partner only knows He seems to have small fear but hops &amp; comes Close to ones feet as if he looked for crumbs &amp; when the woodman strinkles some around He leaves the twig &amp; hops upon the ground &amp; feeds untill his little daintys cloy Then claps his little wings &amp; sings for joy &amp; when in woodland solitudes I wend I always hail him as my hermit friend &amp; naturally enough whenere they come Before me search my pockets for a crumb At which he turns his eye &amp; seems to stand As if expecting somthing from my hand &amp; thus these feathered heirs of solitude Remain the tennants of this quiet wood &amp; live in melody &amp; make their home &amp; never seem to have a wish to roam Beside this ash stulp where in years gone bye The thrush had built &amp; taught her young to flye Where still the nest half filled with leaves remains With moss still green amid the twisting grains Here on the ground &amp; sheltered at its foot The nest is hid close at its mossy root Composed of moss &amp; grass &amp; lined with hair &amp; five brun-coloured eggs snug sheltered there &amp; bye &amp; bye a happy brood will be The tennants of this woodland privacy THE EVERGREEN ROSE Delightful flower tis seldom mine Such lasting smiles to win To see thee through the window shine Each morning looking in &amp; laughing at the window pane Right merry at all hours No matter wether wind or rain Thourt never lost to flowers Autumn takes summer leaves away &amp; strips them like a thief But shake thy green locks as he may He cannot steal a leaf As glossy as the ivys blooms That round the oak is seen No matter how the weather comes Thou'rt still an evergreen Birds scarce believe their eyes to meet A rose tree still in bloom The wren he cocks his tail to see't &amp; whistles when he comes The Robin with his nimble eye Looks sidling on the flower &amp; sings home bits of melody &amp; warms the winter hours Then need I dread the winter more Or think my dwelling drear With evergreens agen the door &amp; roseys all the year THE SHEPHERDS LODGE There are unnoticed spots of earth That the world but seldom sees That know the sweetest joys &amp; mirth —The poets reveries Are shadows to the sunny rays That visits their untroubled days In hidden spots surrounded close With hedges woods &amp; upland swells There snug in solitudes repose A cottage circle dwells The world has never seen before The pathway to that happy door When merry children rich in joy Play summers longest sunshine down As fearless in their minds employ As dwellers in a crowded town Though stranger faces scarce appear At their lone dwelling once a year &amp; but for some few straggling flowers Some roseys nailed against the wall Strangers might pass in silent hours Close bye &amp; never dream at all That human life was living near So hidden doth the place appear The chamber windows huddled up With vine leaves scarce let daylight in A tall man he must double stoop Ere he the door can enter in The eaves so low when sparrows dare To build—boys reach them with a chair A little dyke runs by the door With ozier bushes by the side The winter waters hasty roar Makes little places deep &amp; wide That when the brook has done its song Hold water all the summer long The little wooden brig would make A strangers courage feel at loss That seeming ever on the shake Bends double when they walk accross But custom makes it safetys way &amp; crosses scores of times a day The place is such a lonely place Hid in the seasons circling years They look upon a strangers face As citys when a king appears &amp; nothing human passes bye But they his very foot can spy Which gives them thinkings for the week To wonder who had gone that way The very gates unfrequent creak Calls up the childern from their play To see whats coming—yet tis plain Noughts coming—so they play again The pathway by a stranger guest By accident may lead him bye Like startling groundlark from its nest Where nest could scarce be thought to lie Noises he hears &amp; then he feels The trees some human home consceals The lonely hedges hips &amp; awes They search for on a sabbath day No wishes their attention draws For company—they never stray To neighbouring town—&amp; some there are That never saw a feast or fair It is a shepherds cot &amp; he Has hardly seen a market town But so much used to bush &amp; tree Not grows but he has noted down Around that spot he loves to range &amp; never feels a wish to change He notes the seasons year by year Clouds birds &amp; flowers to ear &amp; eye Are almanacks that tell him clear When change of weather cometh nigh When some by almanacks have guest He smiles &amp; thinks his own the best Upon the lands the pimpernell With crimson rim &amp; golden eye Smiles in his look &amp; shows him well Showers yet are absent from the sky That little sky that like a dome Surrounds his hedgrow fields &amp; home Oft in his rounds he'll hasten home His little hay to cover down Though skys ne'er token rain to come With white rack moving up &amp; down Yet in the willow fringed vale Pipes “wet my foot” the lonely quail Right full upon the southwest gale He hears the tempests murmurs come Long ere the village in the vale Thinks danger is so near its home Long use foretells its coming near Ere distant thunder meets his ear The southwest often gathers up A troop of clouds upon his eye Till distant woods appear to stoop Beneath the burthen of the sky &amp; sure as clouds approach that way He prophecys a rainy day To books unknown he never knows What they to thinking minds supply &amp; yet his simple knowledge shows Much wiser men may profit bye A calm content that never strays From providence in all his days That never errs in sense of right Though simple reasons mark his ways He never rambles out of sight From what he deems his makers praise Though all the sermons which he hears Are his own thoughts &amp; humble fears The poets page he never knew Though Thompsons eye could hardly scan The seasons with such truth or view Their features closer as they ran Familiar from his earliest day He tracked the year from may to may Some few old books in dissaray— Though he is not the man to scoff Good books—about the cottage lay A Bunyan with the covers off A Crusoe wanting some few leaves That wonder for the winter eves &amp; one might marvel half a day To see a book in such a spot &amp; wonder how they found the way In places which the world knows not &amp; careful in a cupboard lay The Bible for the Sabbath day The poets sing of joy but he With lifes right simple feelings strung Feels joy in its rich melody A page of happiness unsung So sweet could kings see through their cares How shepherds live they'd wish it theres THE PRIMROSE BANK Tis spring day roams with flowers Down every little lane &amp; the night is hardly night But a round of happy hours Yes nights are happy nights The sky is full of stars Like worlds in peace they lye Enjoying one delight The dew is on the thorn &amp; the primrose underneath Just agen the mossy root Is smiling to the morn With its little brunny eye &amp; its yellow rim so pale &amp; its crimp &amp; curdled leaf Who can pass its beautys bye Without a look of love When we tread the little path That skirts the woodland side Who can pass—nor look above To him who blesses earth With these messengers of spring &amp; decorates the fields For our happiness &amp; mirth I cannot for I go In my fancy once again In the woods &amp; little holts Where the primrose used to grow The wood bank seemed so fair &amp; the hedgrow in the lane Seemed so sweet that scores of times Have I wished my cottage there &amp; felt that lovely mood As a birthright God had given To muse in the green woods &amp; meet the smiles of heaven &amp; though no culture comes To the places where they grow Every spring finds more &amp; more Till the woods all yellow blooms The woodmans guessing way Oft tramples many down But theres not a blossom missing When he comes another day The woods have happy guests &amp; the birds sing twice as loud When they [see] such crowds of blossoms Underneath their little nests As beautys for the spring Their maker sends them forth That man may have his mirth &amp; nature laugh &amp; sing For when roaming where they flower They seemed to make woods happy &amp; amid the green light round them I've spent many a happy hour But since I used to stray In their hazel haunts for joy The world has found the happy spots &amp; took the charm away It has tracked the pleasant springs Like armys on their march Till dearest spots that used to be Are nought but common things Save that their sights employ Balm gales &amp; sunny blooms The mind in shaping heavens As one continued joy THE WOODS I love to roam the woods Oft patted by the boughs That meet from either side &amp; form an arch of leaves Till hidden as it where from all the world I stand &amp; muse upon the pleasant scene I seem to be myself The only one that treads The earth at such a time So vacant is the mass That spreads around me one hugh sea of leaves &amp; intertwining grains of thickest shades No human eye is visible No human sound attracts The ear—but musing solitude One unembodied thought Thinks the heart into stillness as the world Was left behind for somthing green &amp; new &amp; lonely—&amp; Ive thought In such a spot to build An hermitage or hut With books &amp; leisure left How sweet t'would be but then again I've turned to my old home &amp; felt it vain Yet sure a hut close thatched Chafed by oerleaning boughs In such a place when night Dark on the crowd of trees Found us locked in beside a blazing fire Might give us happiness &amp; pleasing fears Fear books can give us When we read strange tales Of dwellers in the depths Of earths untrodden shades Where woods surround lone huts impassable &amp; nought lives near them but the hope of heaven FEARS Beside the little fire at night I think of dismal things Of lonely spots where pale affright Hides neath nights sooty wings Where nothing bides at such a time But what the fancy finds in ryhme Save some oertaken traveller That night hath led astray Who listens to all sounds that stir Lest thieves should cross his way So lone his lot I feel it joy That other houses are so nigh I think upon the pleasant spots I met beneath the sun &amp; feel how lone the scene has got Now mellow day is done Where nothing but the sheep &amp; cow Lyes resting in their darkness now I feel lone thoughts untill I feel The force of home delights Where snuggest safety doth consceal Our homes on lonely nights Yet outside noises oft will start A fear of somthing in the heart Of listening robbers lurking nigh While darkness in the window throws A blackness on the musing eye A dismal vacancy that grows &amp; would grow to a mighty fear Where not another cottage near The watch dog he is barking nigh Right pleasant notes in safetys ear &amp; smiling upon vacancy The cottage windows blazes near So thus fears fancys I employ &amp; from its pictures gather joy FANCYS I sit &amp; think of distant hills Of fair famed places strange &amp; fair &amp; pleasant moods my fancy fills &amp; wishes for a journey there I picture mountain scenes that lye Above the sunsets painted brow Near neighbours to the painted sky So high grass hardly dares to grow Yet mid the rocks &amp; danger spots I picture many a little nest Where human dwellers live forgot The undisturbing eagles nest I think what sights they daily share Whose windows over look the rocks Whose very thresholds higher are Then highest steeples weathercocks Where clouds like mists below them give Rain to the valleys dropping round &amp; thunders war &amp; yet they live So high as not to hear the sound I read of dwellings such as these Hung in the mountain steeps so high That birds who cross the deepest seas Find not the courage there to flye I read untill I fancy care That bramble in the ways of men Like birds dares not to venture there &amp; then I wish to start again To climb the mountain sides &amp; mark Those little plots of dwelling ground &amp; feel like faith in noahs ark More safe with danger all around To trace the woods that hang in air &amp; oaks their dark bold foliage throw Where weeds if weeds were only there Would seem in dangers way to grow I long to climb the toppling blocks Of stone like castles rising high Where shepherds with their daring flocks Find paths &amp; feel no danger bye I long to reach their cloudy tops &amp; fancy what a many fears Would make my daring rambles stop Till terror tinkles in my ears Yet fancy climbs by rocks deterred Less difficult their shadows grow &amp; where no footing seemed for birds Trees will from out the fissures grow So up I climb—a branch assists Me like a staff up steeper ways &amp; still the tops are hid in mist &amp; so my foolish fancy strays Untill she feels a fairy view Spread to the days unbounded smiles Mountains &amp; vales &amp; citys new A circle of a thousand miles Yet up &amp; up &amp; higher still The circling landscapes stretch away Above the clouds—my pliant will Seems mounting to a brighter day While underneath my feet I leave The fallen clouds &amp; lowly wind &amp; still my fancys so decieve The world itself is left behind Till like the sun I seem to see The world at once—&amp; so I long With travels pleasant groups to be To trace the land of prose &amp; song With mountain shepherds once to try Those heights that fancy paints so fine &amp; tread where mountains touch the sky &amp; look where danger grows divine From rocky heights &amp; glorious hills Dashed with days shades of every hue Till all the heart with rapture fills &amp; grows a jiant at the view I feel a stretch of rapture caught Above the reach of care &amp; pain Till fancy wearys with the thought &amp; meets the common earth again THE SKY LARK LEAVING HER NEST Right happy bird so full of mirth Mounting &amp; mounting still more high To meet morns sunshine in the sky Ere yet it smiles on earth How often I delight to stand Listening a minutes length away Where summer spreads her green array By wheat or barley land To see thee with a sudden start The green &amp; placid herbage leave &amp; in mid air a vision weave For joys delighted heart Shedding to heaven a vagrant mirth When silence husheth other themes &amp; woods in their dark splendour dreams Like heaviness on earth My mind enjoys the happy sight To watch thee to the clear blue sky &amp; when I downward turn my eye Earth glows with lonely light Then nearer comes thy happy sounds &amp; downward drops thy little wing &amp; now the valleys hear thee sing &amp; all the dewy grounds Gleam into joy now from the eye Thourt dropping sudden as a stone &amp; now thourt in the wheat alone &amp; still the circle of the sky &amp; abscent like a pleasure gone Though many come within the way Thy little song to peeping day Is still remembered on For who that crosses fields of corn Where sky larks start to meet the day But feels more pleasure on his way Upon a summers morn Tis one of those heart cheering sights In green earths rural chronicles That upon every memory dwells Among home fed delights THE LANDRAIL How sweet &amp; pleasant grows the way Through summer time again While landrails call from day to day Amid the grass &amp; grain We hear it in the weeding time When knee deep waves the corn We hear it in the summers prime Through meadows night &amp; morn &amp; now I hear it in the grass That grows as sweet again &amp; let a minutes notice pass &amp; now tis in the grain Tis like a fancy everywhere A sort of living doubt We know tis somthing but it ne'er Will blab the secret out If heard in close or meadow plots It flies if we pursue But follows if we notice not The close &amp; meadow through Boys know the note of many a bird In their birdnesting rounds But when the landrails noise is heard They wonder at the sounds They look in every tuft of grass Thats in their rambles met They peep in every bush they pass &amp; none the wiser yet &amp; still they hear the craiking sound &amp; still they wonder why It surely can t be under ground Nor is it in the sky &amp; yet tis heard in every vale An undiscovered song &amp; makes a pleasant wonder tale For all the summer long The shepherd whistles through his hands &amp; starts with many a whoop His busy dog accross the lands In hopes to fright it up Tis still a minutes length or more Till dogs are off &amp; gone Then sings &amp; louder then before But keeps the secret on Yet accident will often meet The nest within its way &amp; weeders when they weed the wheat Discover where they lay &amp; mowers on the meadow lea Chance on their noisey guest &amp; wonder what the bird can be That lays without a nest In simple holes that birds will rake When dusting in the ground They drop their eggs of curious make Deep blotched &amp; nearly round A mystery still to men &amp; boys Who knows not where they lay &amp; guess it but a summer noise Among the meadow hay THE MEADOW GRASS Delicious is a leisure hour Among the sweet green fields to be So sweet indeed I have no power To tell the joys I feel &amp; see See here the meadows how they lie So sunny level &amp; so green The grass is waving ancle high A sweeter rest was never seen I look around &amp; drop me down &amp; feel delight to be alone Cares hardly dare to show a frown While mays sweet leisure is my own Joy half a stranger comes to me &amp; gives me thoughts to profit bye I think how happy worlds must be That dwell above that peaceful sky That happy sky with here &amp; there A little cloud that would express By the slow motions that they wear They live with peace &amp; quietness I think so as I see them glide Thoughts earthly tumults can t destroy So calm so soft so smooth they ride Im sure their errands must be joy The sky is all serene &amp; mild The sun is gleaming far away So sweet so rich—the very child Would feel its maker brought the may For heavens ways are pleasant ways Of silent quietness &amp; peace &amp; he who musing hither strays Finds all in such a scene as this Where no strife comes but in the songs Of birds half frantic in their glee Hid from the rude worlds many wrongs How can they else but happy be In places where the summer seems Entirely out of troubles way Where joy oer out door leisure dreams As if twas sunday every day For nature here in self delight Bestows her richest gifts—the green Luxuriance all around—the light Seems more then any common scene— &amp; yet appears no looker on Left to herself &amp; solitude I seem myself the only one Intruding on her happy mood Intruding as of wont to meet That joyousness she throws around To feel the grass beneath my feet Heart cheered to hear its brushing sound Pit patting at ones legs to feel Their seeded heads then bounce away Theres somthing more then joy to steal A walk oer meadows in the may A noise now comes on joys repose That mays right welcome visit brings Up from the bush the blackbird goes The fanned leaves dance beneath his wings &amp; up with yet a louder noise Woodpiegons flusker—roadway cows Brouze there—&amp; soon the herdboy shows His head amid the shaking boughs Theres somthing more to fill the mind Then words can paint to ears &amp; eyes A calmness quiet loves to find In these green summer reveries A freshness giving youth to age A health to pain &amp; troubles drear The world has nought but wars to wage Peace comes &amp; makes her dwelling here I feel so calm I seem to find A world I never felt before &amp; heaven fills my clouded mind As though it would be dull no more An endless sunshine glows around A meadow like a waveless sea Glows green in many a level ground A very paradise to me Tis sweeter than the sweetest book That ever met the poets eye To read in this delightful nook The scenes that round about me lie &amp; yet they are but common things Green hedges bowering oer the grass &amp; one old tree that stoops &amp; flings Its boughs oer water smooth as glass &amp; on a ledge of gravel crags Those golden blooms so nobly towers Though but the yellow water flags Theyre fine enough for garden flowers &amp; over head the breadth of sky Goes spreading gladness everywhere Yet oer this meadow grass to lie No where so happy seems as here THE WOODPIEGONS NEST Roaming the little path neath dotterel trees Of some old hedge or spinney side I've oft Been startled [pleasantly] from musing ways By frighted dove that suddenly aloft Sprung through the many boughs with cluttering noise Till free from such restraints above the head They smacked their clapping wings for very joys &amp; in a curious mood I've oft been led To climb the twig surrounded trunk &amp; there On some few bits of sticks two white eggs lie As left by accident—all lorn &amp; bare Almost without a nest yet bye &amp; bye Two birds in golden down will leave the shells &amp; hiss &amp; snap at wind blown leaves that shake Around their home where green seclusion dwells Till fledged &amp; then the young adventurers take The old ones timid flights from oak to oak Listening the pleasant sutherings of the shade Nor startled by the woodmans hollow stroke Till autumns pleasant visions pine &amp; fade Then they in bolder crowds will sweep &amp; flye &amp; brave the desert of a winter sky THE RAVENS NEST Upon the collar of an hugh old oak Year after year boys mark a curious nest Of twigs made up a faggot near in size &amp; boys to reach it try all sorts of schemes But not a twig to reach with hand or foot Sprouts from the pillared trunk &amp; as to try To swarm the massy bulk tis all in vain They scarce one effort make to hitch them up But down they sluther soon as ere they try So long hath been their dwelling there—old men When passing bye will laugh &amp; tell the ways They had when boys to climb that very tree &amp; as it so would seem that very nest That ne'er was missing from that selfsame spot A single year in all their memorys &amp; they will say that the two birds are now The very birds that owned the dwelling then Some think it strange yet certaintys at loss &amp; cannot contradict it so they pass as old birds living the woods patriarchs Old as the oldest men so famed &amp; known That even men will thirst into the fame Of boys [&amp;] get at schemes that now &amp; then May captivate a young one from the tree With iron clamms &amp; bands adventuring up The mealy trunk or else by waggon ropes Slung over the hugh grains &amp; so drawn up By those at bottom one assends secure With foot rope stirruped—still a perrilous way So perrilous that one &amp; only one In memorys of the oldest men was known To wear his boldness to intentions end &amp; reach the ravens nest—&amp; thence acchieved A theme that wonder treasured for supprise By every cottage hea[r]th the village through Nor yet forgot though other darers come With daring times that scale the steeples top &amp; tye their kerchiefs to the weather cock As trophys that the dangerous deed was done Yet even now in these adventureous days Not one is bold enough to dare the way Up the old monstrous oak where every spring Finds the two ancient birds at their old task Repairing the hugh nest—where still they live Through changes winds &amp; storms &amp; are secure &amp; like a landmark in the chronicles Of village memorys treasured up yet lives The hugh old oak that wears the ravens nest ON VISITING A FAVOURITE PLACE There is a breath—indeed there is Of eden left—I feel it now Of somthing more then earthly bliss That falls &amp; cheers my sullen brow I gaze about upon the trees I view the sweep of distant hills More high then sources such as these Comes joy that in my heart distills I view the sky—away despair There falls the joy tis only there Health greets me for I hear her voice Hope—peace are comrades once again Joy stoops for flowers that say rejoice &amp; shall such friendships cheer in vain When last I roamed these bleachy swells Of hills &amp; hollows all was here Oer which the heart in rapture dwells Peace love &amp; quiet everywhere &amp; nought is changed since last I came Then can I help but be the same With verses dancing on my tongue The raptures of a heart at ease A fondness &amp; a taste for song &amp; love for places such as these A mind oerflowing with excess Of joys that spring from solitude That sees all nature spring to bless The heart away from noises rude So did its sunshine warm my brow &amp; sure it gleams as lovely now Tis full as still the grazing kine Make but sweet music in their noise The sweetest flowers it owns are mine Free gifts &amp; so are all its joys The trees their friendly arms extend &amp; bid me welcome to their shade The old molehills their welcomes lend As if for rest on purpose made The little pismires only care To mark me an intruder there Am I athirst a little brook Down the corn crowded hollow runs That guggling hides in many a nook Cool draughts from summers sultry suns Although it wants the spreading shade That once oerhung its little pool The bramble here &amp; there hath made A bower accross to keep it cool &amp; cool it runs &amp; clear as wine Where toil in harvest loves to dine In every place in every land Bird beast &amp; all are well supplied They greet it from their makers hand Are happy &amp; are satisfied &amp; shall that masterpiece of mind Man in his makers image live The only thing of earthly kind Doubt him who owneth all to give No God forgive it cannot be Content be all I ask from thee When last I paid a visit here The book I brought for leisures way Was useless for a volume dear In crowds of pictures round me lay The woods the heath the distant field In strips of green &amp; russet dye Did such delicious pleasure yield I shut &amp; put the volume bye The book at home was sweet indeed But there I felt I could not read I felt from all the world away But old affections &amp; esteems While on the short brown sward I lay &amp; joys as somthing more then dreams I viewed the trees &amp; bushes near &amp; distance till it grew to grey A power divine seemed everywhere &amp; joys own rapture where I lay The furzeclumps in their golden flowers Made edens in these golden hours &amp; more they made me feel a sense Of lovliness that dwells above Earth thoughts—when on lifes voyage hence We go to that eternal love That trys to make us happy here By spreading beautys where we roam To cheat us out of earthly fear Till doubts frail pinnace harbours home &amp; pains frail life &amp; cloudy sky Like morning when she opes her eye From night &amp; darkness into day When all its cares &amp; pains are bye &amp; doubt throws all its foils away &amp; meets with joys reality Such scenes will make the mind divine Earth grows a prophet to the eye In such a mood Gods love be mine It were a pleasant thing to die &amp; when our thoughts that aid forgoes O God how dull the journey grows Tis care &amp; dullness all the year Tis sunless in the summer sun Tis cold &amp; cheerless everywhere &amp; o how dark when day is done But hope &amp; joy of such a friend Our poverty becomes a wealth A wealth too rich for life to spend &amp; pain it even turns to health From ills &amp; pains &amp; troubles free How rich that rising sun will be ON SEEING SOME MOSS IN FLOWER EARLY IN SPRING Wood walks are pleasant every day Where thought so full of talk Through autumn brown &amp; winter grey Meets pleasure in the walk O natures pleasant moods &amp; dreams In every journey lies Gladding my heart with simple themes &amp; cheers &amp; gratifyes Though poesys woods &amp; vales &amp; streams Grow up within the mind Like beauty seen in pleasant dreams We no where else can find Yet common things no matter what Which nature dignifyes If happiness be in their lot They gratifye our eyes Some value things for being new Yet nature keeps the old She watches oer the humblest too In blessings manifold The common things of every day However mean or small The heedless eye may throw away But she esteems them all The common things in every place Display their sweets abroad The daisey shows a happy face On every common road When winters past &amp; snows are gone It is the first to bring A merry happy hastener on The coming of the spring &amp; violets—many sorts are known But the sweetest yet that grows Is that which every hedgrow owns &amp; every body knows This moss upon the sallow roots Of this secluded spot Finds seasons that its station suits &amp; blossoms unforgot This common moss so hid from view To heedless crowd unknown By nature made as happy too Finds seasons of its own It peeps among the fallen leaves On every stoven grows Sufficient sun its shade recieves &amp; so it buds &amp; blows Thus common things in every place Their pleasing lessons give They teach my heart lifes good to trace &amp; learn me how to live They feed my heart with one consent That humble hope &amp; fear That quiet peace &amp; calm content Are blessings every where WALKS IN THE WOODS O I do love to force away Through woods where lone the woodman goes Through all the matted shades to stray The brambles tearing at my cloaths &amp; it may tear I love the noise &amp; hug the solitary joys The woodman he from top to toe In leathern doublet brushes on He cares not where his rambles go Thorns briars he beats them every one Their utmost spite his armour foils Unhurt he dares his daily toils Knee deep in fern he daily stoops &amp; loud his bill or hatchet chops As snug he trims the faggots up Or gaps in mossy hedges stops While echo chops as he hath done As if she counted every one Through thickest shades I love to go Where stovens foiled to get above Cramp crook &amp; form so thick below Fantastic arbours—O I love To sit me there till fancy weaves Rich joys beneath a world of leaves Its moss stump grows the easiest chair Agen its grains my back reclines &amp; woodbines twisted fragrance there In many a yellow cluster shines The lonesome bees that hither stray Seem travellers that loose their way The speedy awthorn first of all To show the spring its tender green Here in the way—where branches fall Thornless &amp; smooth is vulgar seen Yet in its roots of safety sure The rabbit burrow lies secure A quiet comes accross the mind With every ruffled thought subdued When fields &amp; light are left behind &amp; twilight leadeth through the wood Parting the branches as we go We sometimes [meet] a path below A little path that shadows plain That other feet hath gone before Yet through such boughs it creeps again As if no feet could find it more Yet trodden on till nearly bare It shows that feet oft trample there Where stickers stroll from day to day &amp; gather loads of rotten wood &amp; poachers left in safety stray When midnight wears its darkest mood When badgers howl &amp; foxes bark Then plops the gun—the thicket dark Seems frighted at unwonted sounds That echo scarcely dares again To call but mutters slowly round What day would answer loud &amp; plain She seems in fear &amp; dread to lie When by their dens the badgers cry But day has nought to do with fears The green light every sound enjoys Boys on the woodside gate she hears &amp; echo shouts as well as boys They tumble down &amp; laugh amain &amp; wonder who can laugh again I brush along—the rustling sound Makes jay birds scream &amp; swop away A warning to the birds around That danger rustles in the way The blackbird answers but the rest Start silent from each mossy nest So many—up one starts agen A blackbird with its spotted breast From hazels oer a badgers den Heres five warm eggs within the nest With spots of brown &amp; bluish gray No boys will find them out to day Where open spots can meet the sky Sweet resting places seldom found Wild strawberrys entertain the eye With crimson berrys shining round Uncropt unlooked for &amp; unknown So birds have gardens of their own Hid round with taper ashen poles Where deep in earth the stoven shoots There grunting badgers burrow holes &amp; bare the twisted mossy roots In the fresh moulds are plainly seen Footmarks when daylight hurried in A noise in oaks above the head Keeps tapping on from day to day Woodpeckers nests are nearly made &amp; patient carpenters are they In hardest oaks their whimbles go &amp; dust like sawdust lies below Where ashen stovens taper grow The squirrels nest upon the top Is seen—&amp; if one shakes below From branch to branch they out &amp; hop &amp; up the oak trunks mealy white They're in a moment out of sight Those sweet excesses oft will start When happy feelings cross the mind That fill with calmness all the heart When all around one boughs are twined When nought but green leaves fill the eye When brushing ash &amp; hazel bye Cornel &amp; thorn &amp; spindle tree &amp; hazel with the nuts in bud &amp; crab &amp; lime that well agree To make a host of underwood It doth ones spirits good to go Through beds of fern that fan below The rustle that the branches make While giving way to let me through The leaves that for a moment shake As out a blackbird hasty flew O there is stillness in the noise That brings to quiet many joys Yes as the bouncing branches start &amp; backward hurry to their place A rapture rushes at the heart A joy comes flushing in the face I feel so glad I can t explain My joy &amp; on I rush again &amp; now I meet a stoven full Of clinging woodbines all in flower They look so rich &amp; beautiful Though loath to spoil so sweet a bower My fingers hitch to pull them down To take a handful to the town So then I mix their showy blooms With many pleasant looking things &amp; fern leaves in my poesy comes &amp; then so beautifully clings The heart leaved briony round the tree It too must in a poesy be Enchanters nightshade some few sprigs So sweet a spot it blossoms in &amp; within reach the leafiest twigs Of oak—if such my reach can win &amp; still unwilling to give oer I stoop till I can hold no more Then by the sun I homeward stray &amp; then the woodman at his toil I hear him chop &amp; guess the way Who when I reach the side will smile &amp; wonder why a man should roam &amp; take such childish trifles home SABBATH BELLS Ive often on a sabbath day Where pastoral quiet dwells Lay down among the new mown hay To listen distant bells That beautifully flung the sound Upon the quiet wind While beans in blossom breathed around A fragrance oer the mind A fragrance &amp; a joy beside That never wears away The very air seems deified Upon a sabbath day So beautiful the flitting wrack Slow pausing from the eye Earths music seemed to call them back Calm settled in the sky &amp; I have listened till I felt A feeling not in words A love that rudest moods would melt When those sweet sounds was heard A melancholly joy at rest A pleasurable pain A love a rapture of the breast That nothing will explain A dream of beauty that displays Ima[g]inary joys That all the world in all its ways Finds not to realize All idly stretched upon the hay The wind-flirt fanning bye How soft how sweetly swept away The music of the sky The ear it lost &amp; caught the sound Swelled beautifully on A fitful melody around Of sweetness heard &amp; gone I felt such thoughts I yearned to sing The humming airs delight That seemed to move the swallows wing Into a wilder flight The butterflye in wings of brown Would find me where I lay Fluttering &amp; bobbing up &amp; down &amp; settling on the hay The waving blossoms seemed to throw Their fragrance to the sound While up &amp; down &amp; loud &amp; low The bells were ringing round A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET IN NOVEMBER Behind the distant spire the sun Sinks beautiful—&amp; rolled In smoky folds cloud-mountains run All edged with peaks of gold &amp; now an orange splendour comes &amp; looses all the blue Again a grove of roses bloom &amp; splendid is the view Now crimson lines awhile remain &amp; cut new mountains high They leave us when we look again &amp; all is like the sky Yes that red bar that stretched for miles &amp; through such splendid crowds Of hills is gone like favours smiles &amp; turned to common clouds RYHMES IN THE MEADOWS To day with summer out of doors Ive had some happy rounds In trailing up the meadow banks &amp; oer the meadow grounds Theres pastoral pleasures out of books Well suiting every taste Tis met in labours merry looks We feel it in his haste When swinging on the meadow path Down to the meadow hay The beans in blossom hemmed him in &amp; patted all the way His flaggon basket on a stick Accross his shoulder hung &amp; the hugh bottle doubtless urged The merry tune he sung Still brushing on the narrow way That to the meadow led The sky lark fluttered from his feet &amp; whistled oer his head Delightful was the meadow scene Its summer toils begun Brought half the village in the hay Loud laughing in the sun The merry water rippled Aye a merry pace it ran Till the bullrush reeled &amp; staggered Like any drunken man Aye the water laughed &amp; travelled &amp; the bulrush danced away &amp; the lark sung pastoral ballads Oer the folks among the hay The sunshine danced &amp; glittered Like a blaze the wrinkles shone Oer &amp; oer the swallow twittered Took a sup &amp; hurried on The standing pools were covered With a sort of hairy moss &amp; the little nodding wagtail Printed many paths accross The hay all oer the meadows lay In shocks &amp; some in swaths Smelling sweeter far than blossoms there All about the little paths The burnets tawny knopples Like little honey combs Bees seeking honey dinners With many passing hums Would come &amp; set them bowing &amp; their sweets would so detain They'd hurry as if going on &amp; turn &amp; try again Aye summer in that happy place Did so their flight detain Full twenty times in little space They'd stop &amp; start again The weeds beside the hedge[s] danced Like lots of drunken men Then rested till a breeze ran bye &amp; off they went agen The meadowsweet in darksome green Shone in the merry light Till winds turned up their lappet leaves &amp; then they changed to white So turns the maidens face to hear The mellancholy song That comes with full as sad a tune From old dames merry tongue She cannot bear to see the men Where men had done the wrong Laugh out at grief—&amp; turns away In trouble from the song She thinks tears in her happy eyes &amp; there her sorrow keeps Smiles on her lips her thoughts disguise She never owns she weeps With an awthorn bush above them &amp; the short sward underfoot They sit them down at dinner time On the green bank at its root Near the lake where water lilies White &amp; yellow are in bloom &amp; the maiden from the hurry oft In the burning weather comes To sip from out her hands &amp; hide Her modestys disguise Unowning she dislikes to kneel Before so many eyes She hears [the] buzzing dragon flye &amp; startles from the place &amp; soon the joke of laughing men Burns red upon her face They say she fears the proffered ale Should turn her beauty brown &amp; there is one say what he will That never meets a frown She sometimes sips to drink a health She keeps within her mind All think her silence pride—but one Says nought &amp; thinks her kind &amp; so she is—when evil eyes Are turned another way She from her bosom steals the fruit There hurded half the day &amp; he as fearful turns unseen &amp; eats the gift by stealth &amp; when the beavering comes again He thinks her double health The mower sees the sun get up With visage roozy red &amp; then the laughing hay folks come &amp; sing him down to bed &amp; there they leave a measured track With every swath cut down &amp; soon the hot &amp; thirsty sun Turns mornings green to brown Till wearied with the haste at last He hides beneath a shower They wait awhile to see his face &amp; sweeten toil an hour &amp; so they sit beneath the shocks Singing pastoral songs &amp; tales &amp; when the rain had wet the hay It sweetened all the vales PASTORAL POESY True poesy is not in words But images that thoughts express By which the simplest hearts are stirred To elevated happiness Mere books would be but useless things Where none had taste or mind to read Like unknown lands where beauty springs &amp; none are there to heed But poesy is a language meet &amp; fields are every ones employ The wild flower neath the shepherds feet Looks up &amp; gives him joy A language that is ever green That feelings unto all impart As awthorn blossoms soon as seen Give may to every heart The pictures that our summer minds In summers dwellings meet The fancys that the shepherd finds To make his leisure sweet The dustmills that the cowboy delves In banks for dust to run Creates a summer in ourselves He does as we have done An image to the mind is brought Where happiness enjoys An easy thoughtlessness of thought &amp; meets excess of joys The world is in that little spot With him—&amp; all beside Is nothing all a life forgot In feelings satisfied &amp; such is poesy its power May varied lights employ Yet to all mind it gives the dower Of self creating joy &amp; wether it be hill or moor I feel where e'er I go A silence that discourses more Then any tongue can do Unruffled quietness hath made A peace in every place &amp; woods are resting in their shade Of social lonliness The storm from which the shepherd turns To pull his beaver down While he upon the heath sojourns Which autumn bleaches brown Is music aye &amp; more indeed To those of musing mind Who through the yellow woods proceed &amp; listen to the wind The poet in his fitful glee &amp; fancys many moods Meets it as some strange melody &amp; poem of the woods It sings &amp; whistles in his mind &amp; then it talks aloud While by some leaning tree reclined He shuns a coming cloud That sails its bulk against the sun A mountain in the light He heeds not for the storm begun But dallys with delight &amp; now a harp that flings around The music of the wind The poet often hears the sound When beauty fills the mind The morn with safforn strips &amp; grey Or blushing to the view Like summer fields when run away In weeds of crimson hue Will simple shepherds' hearts imbue With natures poesy Who inly fancy while they view How grand must heaven be With every musing mind she steals Attendance on their way The simplest thing her heart reveals Is seldom thrown away The old man full of leisure hours Sits cutting at his door Rude fancy sticks to tye his flowers —They're sticks &amp; nothing more With many passing by his door But pleasure has its bent With him 'tis happiness &amp; more Heart satisfied content Those box edged borders that impart Their fragrance near his door Hath been the comfort of his heart For sixty years &amp; more That mossy thatch above his head In winters drifting showers To him &amp; his old partner made A music many hours It patted to their hearts a joy That humble comfort made A little fire to keep them dry &amp; shelter over head &amp; such no matter what they call Each all are nothing less Then poesys power that gives to all A cheerful blessedness So would I my own mind employ &amp; my own heart impress That poesy's self's a dwelling joy Of humble quietness So would I for the biding joy That to such thoughts belong That I lifes errand may employ As harmless as a song BALLADS &amp; SONGS THE SHEPHERDS SONG Mary now let us love employ Among the happy smiles of may &amp; let us bind the wings of joy &amp; keep him captive for a day Nature in love doth now disclose Her flowers in full ripe smiles to thee Twill be too late to seek the rose When autumn leaves have left the tree So let us wreath joys brows to day To morrow he may speed away While on this meadow bank we sit Mark thou the sights that might thee move How that the winds in amorous fit Woo things inanimate to love The bulrush bows in graceful art To kiss the rivers lesser weeds &amp; flags in many a merry start Rustling whisper to the reeds Shall things inanimate agree To love unmoving thee &amp; me See yonder skylark from the corn Rises to sing his wedding lay For he was wed at early morn &amp; twilight gave the bride away The church above the trees doth climb Love promise &amp; we'll soon be there Tis best to borrow haste from time If time has present joys to spare Nor leave loves lot unto the morrow Who oft pays backward debts in sorrow THE MOTHERS ADVICE Come come my boy Robin be wise lad &amp; value An old womans counsil that wishes ye well Neer play with your watch chain nor stand ‘shill I shall I’ Make your mind up at once boy &amp; win Kitty Fell Neer let the abscence of beauty prevent ye That birdlime that catches at charm-smitten men Shes horses &amp; cows boy &amp; money in plenty To make a face tempting at three score &amp; ten Aye cows on the pasture &amp; sheep at the fold &amp; horses to yoke at the waggon or plough &amp; land that would even grow guineas of gold &amp; better the crow never flies over now Her yards never empty of poultry &amp; swine Of the flitch &amp; the ham boy her walls never bare —When the grist bag is torn—theres the bottom of twine &amp; the best of all beauty is much &amp; to spare What pucker your brow boy &amp; will ye be scorning A mothers good counscil—well take ye a wife As fine as ye please but hear this as a warning That love without money brings winter for life Fine wenches I know in the springs sunny weathers Look sweet as the glad singing linnets in spring But birds are not valued for fine painted feathers The sweet singing larks wears a plain russet wing What still are ye silent O fie on ye Robin To scoff at a mother that wishes ye well Where I in your place I would saddle old dobbin &amp; not loose a moment to win Kitty Fell But thourt won by show &amp; its no use advising Yet Robin beware how things glitter &amp; shine An old fashioned guinea is more worth the prizing Than a new minted penny though ever so fine Those fine dressy dames though so gay &amp; bewitching That show their fine hues as a peacock his tail Are just as much use in a cottagers kitchen As plumbs in a piecrust &amp; sugar in ale So take your own trundle—I'll sit &amp; content me To think that Ive told ye the best in my power &amp; do as ye please since theres nought to prevent ye But mind that ye dont pluck a weed for a flower Theres many a fop taen by dazzel &amp; dressing That turns up his nose at a girl getting old Still the proverb is true that might learn ye a lesson Always creep neath an old hedge to get from the cold The pie trusts her dwelling on trees high &amp; airy Just as week chances &amp; storms may agree But larks Robin heark ye right cautious &amp; wary Ensure a snug home at the root of the tree WOMAN They may boast as they will over pleasures repast Tracing bliss to false sources in idle employ Yet still they acknowledge that woman at last Is the fount from whence flows the worlds essence of joy They may boast about flowers of the summers perfume But when alls said &amp; done can a blossom compare To the cheeks of a lovely young maiden in bloom O where is the rose found so luscious as there They may talk about pleasure in lifes solitude But when alls said &amp; done &amp; its silence is tried They will soon wish again in the world to intrude Where the heart aching charms of a woman abide They may sing about wine &amp; applaud in their glee The glass that a moment of trouble beguiles But folly reflecting soon wishes to be In the sunlight of joy where a sweet woman smiles Every pleasure on earth let them laud to the skies While under gay bacchus's idle controul They shall all find in reason that woman supplies The relish &amp; savour that sweeten the whole Beauty dwells in the fragrance &amp; colour of flowers Beauty sparkles in wine &amp; the pomp of the hall But love in a desert will challange his powers —There the beauty of woman surpasses them all SONG [O the voice of womans love] O the voice of womans love What a bosom stirring word Was a sweeter ever uttered Was a dearer ever heard Than womans love How it melts upon the ear How it nourishes the heart Cold ah cold must his appear Who hath never shared a part Of womans love Tis pleasure to the mourner Tis freedom to the thrall The pilgrimage of many &amp; the resting place of all Is womans love Tis the gem of beautys birth It competes with joys above What were angels upon earth If without a womans love A womans love FIRST LOVES RECOLLECTIONS First love will with the heart remain When all its hopes are bye As frail rose blossoms still retain Their fragrance till they die &amp; joys first dreams will haunt the mind With shades from whence they sprung As summer leaves the stems behind On which springs blossoms hung Mary I dare not call thee dear Ive lost that right so long Yet once again I vex thine ear With memorys idle song Had time &amp; change not blotted out The love of former days Thou wert the last that I should doubt Of pleasing with my praise When honied tokens from each tongue Told with what truth we loved How rapturous to thy lips I clung Whilst nought but smiles reproved But now methinks if one kind word Were whispered in thine ear Thoudst startle like an untamed bird &amp; blush with wilder fear How loath to part how fond to meet Had we too used to be At sunset with what eager feet I hastened on to thee Scarce nine days passed ere we met In spring nay wintry weather Now nine years suns have risen &amp; set Nor found us once together Thy face was so familiar grown Thyself so often bye A moments memory when alone Would bring thee to mine eye But now my very dreams forget That witching look to trace Though there thy beauty lingers yet It wears a stranger face I felt a pride to name thy name But now that pride hath flown My words een seem to blush for shame That own I love thee on I felt I then thy heart did share Nor urged a binding vow But much I doubt if thou couldst spare One word of kindness now &amp; what is now my name to thee Though once nought seemed so dear Perhaps a jest in hours of glee To please some idle ear &amp; yet like counterfeits with me Impressions linger on Though all the gilded finery That passed for truth is gone Ere the world smiled upon my lays A sweeter meed was mine Thy blushing look of ready praise Was raised at every line But now methinks thy fervent love Is changed to scorn severe &amp; songs that other hearts approve Seem discord to thine ear When last thy gentle cheek I prest &amp; heard thee feign adieu I little thought that seeming jest Would prove a word so true A fate like this hath oft befell Een loftier hopes than ours Spring bids full many buds to swell That neer can grow to flowers BALLAD [There is a tender flower] There is a tender flower Yet found in every clime That decks the rudest bower Nor stays for place or time In caves or desert sands Unblest with sun or shower Wherever life expands Is found this tender flower Where storms with keenest breath Bid stronger flowers decay— Where suns een shun its birth It is content to stay In sunshine &amp; in gloom As if 'twere sorrows dower In griefs lap it will bloom Or die a lovely flower Within lifes wilderness This fond &amp; tender flower Doth every bosom bless &amp; garlands sorrows bower Rude falsehood may despise Its bloom when in its power &amp; idle themes devise To mock this injured flower Yet truth hath long agreed To call it first of flowers Though treated like a weed Too oft in follys bowers On earth it loves to dwell Though blest with heavenly power &amp; sure I need not tell That loves the lauded flower THE MAID OF THE HALL Of all the fine lasses Ive led down the dance Ive neer seen her equal at all If ye search all the towns between London &amp; France Theres none like the maid of the Hall Deckd out like a lady above all the rest She looked like the queen of the ball &amp; all the young ploughmen that saw her confest Twas a beauty that came from the Hall Her feet stept so graceful so airy &amp; gay &amp; so true to the fiddle did fall To see but her dancing twould win ye to say Theres none like the maid of the Hall Her speech is so proper so fine &amp; polite Not a word in her talk she'll miscall The clowns all concieted who saw her that night Twas the Lady herself from the Hall I feign would have begged her my sweetheart to be But I feared that my chance would be small So many agreed in opinion with me That the finest lass came from the Hall She shewed such good humour &amp; prattled so free We fancied she loved but us all We knew not behaviour from courtship not we Which distinguished the maid of the Hall I once thought on paper my suit to appeal &amp; to send her a letter withall But ignorance then would my meaness reveal &amp; disgrace the fair maid of the Hall I once thought of telling my passion outright But then if a word I'd let fall So vulgar it would have been sport for the night &amp; ashamed the fair maid of the Hall &amp; as I do love her &amp; win her I can t I'll entice her with nothing at all As to come at her love all beside it I want Heres adieu to the maid of the Hall BALLAD [I dreamt not what it was to woo] I dreamt not what it was to woo &amp; felt my heart secure Till Robin dropt a word or two Last evening on the moor Though with no flattering words the while His suit he urged to move Fond ways informed me with a smile How sweet it was to love He left the path to let me pass The dropping dews to shun &amp; walked himself among the grass I deemed it kindly done &amp; when his hand was held to me As oer each stile we went I deemed it rude to say him nay &amp; manners to consent He saw me to the town &amp; then He sighed but kissed me not &amp; whispered ‘we shall meet agen’ But did'n't say for what Yet on my breast his cheek had lain &amp; though it gently press'd It bruised my heart &amp; left a pain That robs it of its rest BALLAD [Where is the heart thou once hast won] Where is the heart thou once hast won Can cease to care about thee Where is the eye thou'st smiled upon Can look for joy without thee Lorn is the lot one heart hath met Thats lost to thy caressing Cold is the hope that loves thee yet Now thou art past possessing Fare thee well We met we loved weve met the last The farewell word is spoken O Mary canst thou feel the past &amp; keep thy heart unbroken To think how warm we loved &amp; how Those hopes should blossom never To think how we are parted now &amp; parted oh for ever Fare thee well Thou wert the first my heart to win Thou art the last to wear it &amp; though another claims akin Thou must be one to share it Oh had we known when hopes were sweet That hopes would once be thwarted That we should part no more to meet How sadly we had parted Fare thee well THE MILKMAID Three seasons have gone—sin' my shepherd did leave me To go for a soldier in wars far away His red coat became him—he'll never decieve me Yet I grieved &amp; this puts me in mind of the day The cow pasture buttercups paved it with gold The hedges about it were smothered in may &amp; the sheep by a stranger let out of the fold Seemed to sorrow like me for his going away Beside this old thorn I remember't as well As though it was milking time but yesterday His old dog that with a new master did dwell Saw his red coat &amp; feather &amp; hurried away He called him by name &amp; he came at his call For he knew his voice well but in terror &amp; fear He stared at his red coat &amp; feather &amp; all &amp; dropt on his haunches &amp; wouldnt come near Though the sound of his voice made him prick up his ear He could not believe him in such a disguise My old dogs forgot me he said—&amp; the tear Of regret though a soldier I saw in his eyes I took it for granted &amp; why disbelieve him Twas me that occasioned a moment of pain Though he doubted my soldier I'll never decieve him If they keep him for life I shall know him again &amp; three years have gone sin' this thorn was in blossom I never pass bye but I think on the day By the side of a hill stood a cowslap in blossom I cropt it—&amp; he got a branch of the may &amp; when we had talked the last moment to parting My heart while I think ont half doubtfully burns He held it to me &amp; he said just a starting Jane take this &amp; keep it till Jemmy returns I sighed—but he laughed &amp; said dont be fainthearted Twas only to hide deeper trouble from me For he lingered I thought that we couldnt have parted &amp; turned to look back far as eer we could see A keepsake so odd could he mean to abuse me &amp; give me the thorn that his slight I might see Tis foolish to think ont—he'll never ill use me For he rubbed off the pricks ere he gave it to me THE MILKING HOUR The sun had grown on lessening day A table large &amp; round &amp; in the distant vapours grey Seemed leaning on the ground When Mary like a lingering flower Did tenderly agree To stay beyond her milking hour &amp; talk awhile with me We wandered till the distant town Had silenced nearly dumb &amp; lessened on the quiet ear Small as a beetles hum She turned her buckets upside &amp; down &amp; made us each a seat &amp; there we talked the evening brown Beneath the rustling wheat &amp; while she milked her breathing cows I sat beside the streams In musing oer our evening joys Like one in pleasant dreams The bats &amp; owls to meet the night From hollow trees had gone &amp; een the flowers had shut for sleep &amp; still she lingered on We mused in rapture side by side Our wishes seemed as one We talked of times retreating tide &amp; sighed to find it gone &amp; we had sighed more deeply still Oer all our pleasures past If we had known what now we know That we had met the last SONG [Come give us the health to the dearest on earth] Come give us the health to the dearest on earth To the fairest the first &amp; the best The comfort of joy &amp; the sunlight of mirth From the south &amp; the east to the west Then heres to the suns that illumine the earth To the flowers that in winter are blooming To the gems that are found above purchase &amp; worth The love &amp; the beauty of woman Then give us the health to the dearest on earth To the gem of all climates &amp; soils To the heart stirring pulse that enlivens our mirth &amp; the comfort that sweetens our toils Then heres to the flowers in the desert of care That in calms &amp; in tempests are blooming &amp; heres to the angels of earth—so they are The love &amp; the beauty of woman The charm that gives sweetness to wine &amp; to mirth &amp; the balm of our anguish &amp; thrall The welcome &amp; wealth of the cottagers hearth &amp; the gem of both palace &amp; hall What ist but our health to the dearest on earth To the flowers that in winter are blooming The eden where joy is indebted for birth The love &amp; the beauty of woman Then heres to the health of the dearest on earth &amp; the treasures of cottage &amp; hall Then heres to our very existance &amp; birth Life without them were nothing at all Theyre the joy of our sorrow the rest of our pain Theyre the flowers that in deserts are blooming Then fill up the glass &amp; we'll give it again To the love &amp; the beauty of woman LOVE Love though it is not chill &amp; cold But burning like eternal fire It is not of approaches bold Which gay dramatic tastes admire O timid love more fond then free In dareing song is ill pourtrayed Where as in war the devotee By valour wins each captive maid Where hearts are prest to hearts in glee As they could tell each others minds Where ruby lips are kissed as free As flowers are by the summer winds —No gentle love that timid dream Whose hopes &amp; fears at foil &amp; play Work like a skiff against the stream Where it loves most finds least to say It lives in blushes &amp; in sighs In hopes for which no words are found Thoughts dare not look but in the eyes The tongue is left without a sound The pert &amp; forward things that dare Their whispers in each others ear Feel no more then their shadows there Mere things of form with nought of fear True passion that so burns within Is timid as the doves disguise Tis for the murder aiming hawk To dart at every bird that flies True love it is no daring bird But like the little timid wren That in the new leaved thorns of spring Shrinks further from the sight of men The idol of its musing mind The worship of its lonely hour Love wooes her in the summer wind It tells her name to every flower But in her sight no open word Escapes Loves passion to declare The sighs by beautys majic stirred Are all that speak its passion there BALLAD [The spring returns the pewet screams] The spring returns the pewet screams Loud welcomes to the dawning Though harsh &amp; ill as now it seems Twas music last may morning The grass so green—the daisy gay Wakes no joy in my bosom Although the garland last mayday Wore not a finer blossom For by this bridge my Mary sat &amp; praised the screaming plover As first to hail the day—when I Confessed myself her lover &amp; at that moment stooping down I pluckt a daisy blossom Which smilingly she called her own May garland for her bosom &amp; in her breast she hid it there As true loves happy omen Gold had not claimed a safer care I thought loves name was woman I claimed a kiss she laughed away I sweetly sold the blossom I thought myself a king that day My throne was beautys bosom &amp; little thought an evil hour Was bringing clouds around me &amp; least of all that little flower Would turn a thorn to wound me— She showed me after many days Though withered—how she prized it &amp; then she leaned to wealthy praise &amp; my poor love despised it Aloud the whirring pewet screams The daisy blooms as gaily But where is Mary—absence seems To ask that question daily No where on earth where joy can be To glad me with her pleasure Another name she owns—to me She is as stolen treasure When lovers part—the longest mile Leaves hope of some returning Though mines close bye—no hope the while Within my heart is burning One hour would bring me to her door Yet sad &amp; lonely hearted If seas between us both should roar We were not further parted Though I could reach her with my hand Ere suns the earth goes under Her heart from mine—the sea &amp; land Are not more far asunder The wind &amp; clouds now here now there Hold not such strange dominion As womans cold perverted will &amp; soon estranged opinion THE OLD MANS SONG Youth has no fear of ill by no cloudy days anoyed But the old mans all hath fled &amp; his hopes have met their doom The bud hath burst to bloom &amp; the flower been long destroyed The root too is withered &amp; no more can look for bloom So I have said my say &amp; I have had my day &amp; sorrow like a young storm creeps dark upon my brow Hopes like to summer winds they have all blown away &amp; the worlds sunny side is turned over with me now &amp; left me like a lame bird upon a withered bough I look upon the past tis as black as winter days But the worst it is not over there is blacker days to come O would I had but know[n] of the wide worlds many ways But futurity is blind so I een must share my doom Joy once reflected brightly of prospects overcast But now like a looking glass thats turned to the wall Life is nothing but a blank &amp; the sunny shining past Is overspread with glooms that doth every hope enthrall While troubles daily thicken in the wind ere they fall Life smiled upon me once as the sun upon the rose My heart so free &amp; open guessed every face a friend Though the sweetest flower must fade &amp; the sweetest season close Yet I never gave it thought that my happiness would end Till the warmest seeming friends grew the coldest at the close As the sun from lonely night hides its haughty shining face Yet I could not think them gone for they turned not open foes While memory fondly mused former favours to retrace &amp; I turned but only found that my shadow kept its place &amp; this is nought but common life what every body finds As well as I or mores the luck of those that better speed I'll mete my lot to bear with the lot of kindred minds &amp; grudge not those who say they for sorrow have no need Why should I when I know that it will not aid a nay For summer is the season even then the little flye Finds friends enew indeed both for leisure &amp; for play But on the winter window why they crawl alone to die Such is life &amp; such am I a wounded &amp; a winter stricken flie SALLY GREEN I cannot bethink me the matter Of the anguish thats got in my breast Where my heart like a bird pitter patter Will not let me get any rest Ive neer drank no ale to be teazing My head—yet right sick have I been &amp; my ills have been daily increasing Ever since I first saw Sally Green Folks talk about one little cupid As how a heart robber is he But to think he stole mine why its stupid When he can t reach so high as my knee No no Im aware of whose got it Yet the robber no robber has been We cannot steal gifts—so odd rot it How can I go blame Sally Green &amp; to call her a thief would be loathing For beauty like hers cannot steal 'Sides she might have a score hearts for nothing Their praises folks cannot consceal They stare in her face for her beauty But she neer looks to know what they mean If they think to have that as their booty They already mistake Sally Green She smiled at me over her shoulder Though I'd never danced with her before —Had the king ha' been there to behold her He'd never forgot her no more She looked so delightful &amp; blooming No pack of cards own such a queen Good dear if the king had been coming He'd ha' thought her his own Sally Green The parson in last sundays sermon Often turned a hard look in my face Though Im sure I did nought there was harm in Nor slept een a wink in my place —I know that while prayers are a reading No other guess things should be seen &amp; though he my thoughts was a heeding Pray who could forget Sally Green I reached her a rose yester morning The best I could find on the tree &amp; to hurt her Im sure I'd be scorning Who neer thought a thing to hurt me So I rubbed off the thorns from the blossom &amp; I sighed though it could not be seen When I offered the gift for her bosom As the best I could give Sally Green I set up the dance at the shearing &amp; I quaked like a bird in the snow Though the people all said in my hearing They were melting like ice in a thaw But just like a blossom at mayday There sat betwixt me &amp; the screen —Good dear need I tell ye the lady Did ye know how I love Sally Green Ive been six years in service come may day &amp; but six weeks in love overseen For in truth though I thought her a lady Folks call her a child of sixteen But let them be laughing &amp; humming Folks often say more then they mean For believe me I neer saw a woman So charming as young Sally Green I loved her too dearly to linger Though they talked of such out o way things &amp; ashamed to examine her finger I made a guess start for the ring Says the Goldsmith says he Mr Ploughman Now seek out the size that ye mean Gosh—I sighd I could hardly tell how mun But the smallest will fit Sally Green The man laughing loud when I said so Bore me down that I pickt it too small But if dame Tibbs had been at my elbow She'd have seen he knew nothing at all —Aye—she'd one Mr Goldsmith to pleaze ye The big finger size that ye mean But she saw one get two in it easy &amp; that was my sweet Sally Green So I brought her the ring at a venture &amp; I shall go see bye &amp; bye But I dont wish that fools should torment her &amp; I know she is timid &amp; shy Like a rosebud that blushes in may so &amp; seems half afraid to be seen I know who she loves—&amp; wont say so So why need I plague Sally Green When I meet her at milking o mornings &amp; offer her help over stiles I never meet none of her scornings For she pays me in blushes &amp; smiles Though she seems always willing to linger She colours wheneer we are seen Yet when the ring graces her finger She'll soon forget shoy Sally Green But I know when the parson comes near her She'll wish his big book on the shelf &amp; be ready to faint—but I'll cheer her &amp; speak both for her &amp; myself For I know that she'll stick to her duty Though a bible vow never had been &amp; if truth as folks tell ye be beauty Ive no cause to doubt Sally Green BALLAD—THE BACKWARD SPRING The day waxes warmer The winters far gone Then come out my charmer &amp; bring summer on Thy beauty is gleaming So sweet where ye be Tis summer &amp; sunshine To be only with thee Tardy spring came so loathing I thought that the spring Had took winters cloathing But no such a thing For the snow neath the hedges Hath packt up &amp; gone &amp; mays little pledges For summer comes on The flowers on the awthorn —Oak balls on the tree &amp; the blackbird is building Loves pallace in glee Then come out my charmer &amp; lead summer on Where e'er thou art smiling Care &amp; winter are gone —Even snows neath thy feet I could fancy to be A carpet of daiseys —The rime on the tree Would bloom in thy smiling &amp; quickly appear Like blossoms beguiling The prime of the year The ice on the water O I could agree That winter had changed to A pallace for thee Turning pools into mirrors &amp; silence to glee Reflecting the image Of rapture in thee Then come forth my charmer Thy presence can charm Into summer the winter To sunshine the storm I can think how delightful The prospect would be In summer or winter That blest me with thee But the place of thy absence All language is lost I cannot imagine What pain it would cost Though without thee I feel Where a desert would be &amp; all in thy presence Grows eden with me NUTTING Right rosey gleamed the autumn morn Right golden shone the autumn sun The mowers swept the bleached corn While long their early shades did run The leaves were burnt to many hues The hazel nuts were ripe &amp; brown My Marys kindness could but chuse To pluck them when I bore them down The shells her auburn hair did show A zemblance faint yet beautiful She smiled to hear me tell her so Till I forgot the nuts to pull I looked up on ash &amp; thorn For nuts—my wits was all astray She laughed so rich that autumn morn All all but love was wide away &amp; soon the day was on its wane Ere joy had thought one hour away Who could but wish them back again When love was so inclined to stay She started at each little sound The branches made—yet would her eye Regret the gloom encroaching round That told her night was in the sky I helped her through the hedge row gap &amp; thought the very thorns unkind As not to part—while in her lap She sought the ripest bunch to find Then on a hill beneath a tree We leamed her nuts—as lover spells She often threw the nuts at me &amp; blushed to see me hurd the shell Love tokens for an after day Passports a blushing kiss to claim Soon went that autumn eve away &amp; never more its fellow came The west was in a glorious trim Of colours mixed in endless thrall &amp; on the dark woods distant rim The sun hung like a golden ball Right luscious was those nutting bowers Impulses sweet for many a day Joy never smiled on sweeter hours Or sighed oer sweeter passed away Twas Marys smiles &amp; sweet replies That gave the sky so sweet a stain So bright I never saw him rise Nor ever set so sweet again THE GIPSEY SONG The Gipseys life is a merry life &amp; happy boys we be We pay no rent nor tax to none &amp; live untythed &amp; free None cares for us for none care we &amp; where we list we roam &amp; merry boys we gipseys be Though the wild woods are our home &amp; come what will brings no dismay We're with few cares perplext For if to days a swaily day We meet with luck the next &amp; thus we sing &amp; kiss our mates While our chorus still shall be Bad luck to tyrant majistrates &amp; the gipseys dwelling free To mend old pans &amp; bottom chairs Around the towns we tramp When a day or two our purse repairs &amp; plenty fills our camp &amp; our songs we sing &amp; our fiddles sound Their catgut harmony While echo fills the woods around With gipsey liberty The green grass is our softest bed The sun our clock we call The nightly sky hangs over head Our curtains house &amp; all Though housless while the wild winds blow Our joys are uncontrouled We barefoot dance through winters snow When others die with cold Our maidens they are fond &amp; free &amp; lasting are their charms Brown as the berry on the tree No suns their beauty harms Their beautys are no garden blooms That fade before they flower Unsheltered where the tempest comes They smile in sun &amp; shower &amp; they are wild as the woodland hare That feeds on the evening lea &amp; what care we for ladys fair Since ours are fond &amp; free False hearts hide in a lily skin But ours are coarse &amp; fond No parsons fetters link us in Our hearts a stronger bond Though the wild woods are our house &amp; home Tis a home of liberty Free as the summer clouds we roam &amp; merry boys we be We dance &amp; sing the year along &amp; loud our fiddles play &amp; no day goes without a song With us all months are may The hare that haunts the fallow grounds &amp; round the common feeds The fox that tracks the woodland bounds &amp; in the thicket breeds These are the neighbours were we dwell &amp; all the guests we see That share &amp; love the quiet well Of gipsey liberty The elements have grown our friends &amp; leave our huts alone The thunder bolt that rocks &amp; rends The cotters house of stone Flys harmless by our blanket roofs Where the winds may burst &amp; blow For our camps though thin are tempest proof &amp; buffet rain &amp; snow May the lot we've met our lives befall &amp; nothing worse attend So heres success to gipseys all &amp; every gipsey friend &amp; while the ass that bears our camp Can find a common free Around old Englands heaths we'll tramp In gipsey liberty PEGGY BAND O it was a lorn &amp; a dismal night &amp; the storm beat loud &amp; high Nor a friendly light to guide me right Was there shining in the sky When a lonely hut my wanderings met Lost in a foreign land &amp; I found the dearest friend as yet In my lovely Peggy Band “O father heres a soldier lad “&amp; weary he seems to be” “Then welcome him in” the old man said— &amp; she gave her seat to me The fire she trimmed &amp; my cloaths she dried With her own sweet lily hand &amp; oer the soldiers lot she sighed While I blest my Peggy Band When I told the tale of my wandering years &amp; the nights unknown to sleep She made excuse to hide her tears &amp; she stole away to weep A pilgrims blessing I seemed to share As saints of the holy land &amp; I thought her a guardian angel there Though he called her his Peggy Band The night it passed &amp; the hour to part With the morning winged away &amp; I felt an anguish at my heart That vainly bade to stay I thanked the old man for all he did &amp; I took his daughters hand But my heart was full &amp; I could not bid Farewell to my Peggy Band A blessing on that friendly cot Where the soldier found repose &amp; a blessing be her constant lot Who soothed the strangers woes I turned a last look on the door As she held it in her hand &amp; my heart ached sore as I crossed the moor To leave my Peggy Band To the weary ways that I have gone Full many friends befell &amp; Ive met with maidens many a one To use the soldier well But of all the maids I ever met At home or in foreign land Ive never seen the equal yet Of my charming Peggy Band BALLAD [The morning hour the sun beguiles] The morning hour the sun beguiles With glorys brightly blooming The flower &amp; summer meet in smiles &amp; so Ive met with woman But suns must set with dewy eve &amp; leave the scene deserted &amp; flowers must with the summer leave So I &amp; Mary parted O Mary I did meet thy smile When passion was discreetest &amp; thou didst win my heart the while When woman seemed the sweetest When joys were felt that cannot speak &amp; memory cannot smother When loves first beauty flushed thy cheek More sweet then any other Those eyes that then my passion blest That burned in loves expression That bosom where I then could rest &amp; now have no possession These waken still in memory Sad ceasless thoughts about thee That say how blest Ive been with thee &amp; how I am without thee SONG [Come push round the glass tis a god in disguise] Come push round the glass tis a god in disguise For riches &amp; joy at its bright bottom lies What mind is more healthy then his thats at rest &amp; he that drinks deepest is first to be blest Though cant may assail us we'll sit at our ease As her preaching &amp; practice so seldom agrees She loves what she rails at &amp; soaks in disguise &amp; sins more then we do in forging up lies So push round the glass let us live while we may While joys wings are wetted he can t flye away The prude he may rail &amp; the vile hypocrite But a cloak both must have for to make their black white Good wine needs no bush &amp; day light no pall Nor a plain honest face need not turn to the wall So shame not the glass to abuse what we need But drink &amp; be merry let that be our creed Then push round the glass &amp; to honour the feast If we must have a lecture let bacchus be priest See his wig of vine leaves &amp; his cheeks how they glow The maxim he gives it behoves us to know “To do unto others as we'd be done to” Thats the soul of religion &amp; all we need do So let cant assail us none cares for her creed The more she's against us the more we shall speed BALLAD [Fair maiden when my love began] Fair maiden when my love began Ere thou thy beauty knew I fearless owned my passion then Nor met reproof from you But now perfection wakes thy charms &amp; strangers turn to praise Thy pride my faint grown heart alarms &amp; I scarce dare to gaze Those lips to which mine own did grow In loves glad infancy With ruby ripeness now doth glow As gems too rich for me The full blown rose thy cheeks doth wear Those lilys on thy brow Forget whose kiss their buds did wear &amp; bloom above me now Those eyes whose first sweet timid light Did my young hopes inspire Like midday suns in splendour bright Now burn me with their fire Nor can I weep what I bemoan As great as are my fears Too burning is my passion grown To e'er be quenched by tears BALLAD [If love be such a wilderness] If love be such a wilderness So full of ills &amp; pains &amp; fate Where to pass through is sure distress As wailing doleful drones relate Why should I to such dangers grow While there are safer roads to go But well I wot the pains &amp; ills That sighing lovers do reveal Are fashioned most by their own wills &amp; as they fancy so they feel If they must mourn 'cause one says “no” Themselves alone do will it so A maidens frown is not my fate My heart for hers I'll freely give But if for love she offers hate I'll keep my own &amp; rather live Fool should I be to pain endure Which frowns can make &amp; smiles can cure If I ask one that answers “no” Am I to end my hopes therebye She cannot make all wills think so Then prythee tell me why should I If she says “no” the next I wis When met as ready may say “yes” Let lovers fancy what they list I'll but admire it for its joys Nor sigh &amp; grieve as beauty wist Like restless childern after toys For why should I in trouble run Which I by heeding not may shun That love which youth sets out to seek As eager as the brook doth run Is not sown on a painted cheek Where at fools tamper &amp; are won But wisdom speeds till these be past &amp; finds it in the heart at last BALLAD [O would I were the little bird] O would I were the little bird To love without a fear I'd up &amp; tell my love a tale Might win an angels ear I'd up &amp; tell a tale of truth A tale of trouble too How I do love—how fain to tell For that I dare not do O would I were the golden cage &amp; she the little dove To wear her on my breast for aye A bosom load of love My heart alone her pearch should be Whereon to nest &amp; woo There love my fill &amp; own it all For that I dare not do O would I were the little flower The flower she favours best I'd waste my fragrance all for love Upon her bonny breast I'd press with joy my snowy bed &amp; kiss my pillow too &amp; love till death &amp; say I would But that I dare not do O would I were but any thing Then the poor thing I be A bird or flower or een a flye Less fear it owns then me Twill try both lip &amp; bosom where My hopes dare never go &amp; sing where I must silent mourn For what I dare not do BALLAD [The roseys red the roseys white] The roseys red the roseys white The rosey blooms in sunny light But ah it clouds the hearts delight To muse upon its history It tells aye many a woeful tale Of hearts made cold of cheeks made pale Of loves sad sigh of widows wail In days of strife &amp; chivalry &amp; freedom may it aye prevail That strife no more may be The roseys red the roseys white The roseys pleasant to the sight Now both their hues in one unite To crown the brows of loyalty Strife took the white rose for its crest But concord placed it in her vest Where it blushed red upon her breast To join the rose of liberty &amp; while it blooms as freedoms guest There let it ever be THE HOMELESS EMIGRANTS SONG O false love is a bitter thing &amp; song alone may break the spell But silence numbs at my harp string My woes nor song nor words may tell Tears they will flow for many wrongs While mine with hopeless winter freeze &amp; sighs &amp; tears fill many songs But mine must mourn for more than these Of friends I neer must see again That now perchance the grass grows oer Of joys whose memorys worse then pain To think of &amp; to see no more Of loves for which mine own must ach The more to think it aches in vain Yet more then this it takes to break My heart for which no words remain Tis worse then sickness worse then fears Then palid looks &amp; hollow eyes Tis made of thoughts no bosom hears That wring the sick heart till it dies Some sigh of wounds from Cupids bow From deeper wounds my troubles spring Alas a heart half broken now Hath left but little power to sing Tis not of love I would disclose My troubles flow from deeper streams Tis my poor country sunk in woes All else were vain &amp; idle themes No muse leads me through fancys tales Like one to whom her powers belong A homeless lot my heart bewails &amp; truths the sorrow of the song SONG [Sweet the pleasures I do find] Sweet the pleasures I do find Lovely Jessey near thee When every green with flowers is lined &amp; linnets sing to cheer thee Then my love so fair so kind Tis heaven while I'm near thee—Jessey Heaven while Im near thee Though tis not the charms of spring Can add a charm to cheer me When every pleasures took to wing &amp; left the pasture dreary When every birds forgot to sing Tis heaven to be near thee—Jessey Heaven to be near thee Left to winters frost &amp; snow When storms descend severly Left with birds to pick the slow &amp; left with thee to cheer me Still while lifes red tide shall flow Heaven would be near thee—Jessey Heaven would be near thee Banished to some barren isle Where famine scowled severely Jessey blest with thee the while Till life was left to cheer me Still on fate &amp; thee I'd smile For heaven would be near thee—Jessey Heaven would be near thee THE SHEPHERDS LAMENT Ah faithless love I've met thy scorning &amp; lain awake from night till morning Sin' Robins ye agree'd to be &amp;

ever sin' ye left your Granny To seek your service haughty Nanny Have I been fooled to think ye mine I little thought ye'd look above me When ye were young &amp; used to love me &amp; innoscent as aught could be As any lamb beside its mother When ye would run &amp;

ditcher Or beggar that makes his own horn To join us oer bottle or pitcher Foaming oer with the essence of corn We care not with whom we get tipsey Or where with brown stout we regale We'll weather the storm with a gipsey If he be a lover of ale We'll weather the toughest storm weary Although we get wet to the skin If the outside our cottage looks dreary We're warm &amp; right happy within We'll sit till the bushes are dropping Like the spout of a watering pan For till the drams drank theres no stopping We'll keep up the ring to a man We'll sit till dame nature is feeling The breath of our stingo so warm &amp; bushes &amp; trees begin reeling In our eyes like to ships in a storm We'll sit from three hours before seven When larks wake the morning to dance Till nights sutty brood of eleven When witches ride over to france We'll sit it in spite of the weather Till we tumble our length on the plain When the morning shall find us together To play the game over again THE OFFER A BALLAD With my hair down my back &amp;

ten be my last travels numbered Three score &amp; ten is the length I desire Then with few pains &amp; few struggles encumbered Small would the blow be that death would require Deaths labours light when by age life is wounded &amp;

fare thee well Nor think ye'll have to tell Of wounded hearts from me Locked up in your hearts cell Mine still at home doth dwell In its first liberty Bees sip not at one flower Spring comes not with one shower Nor shines the sun alone Upon one favoured hour But with unstinted power Makes every day his own &amp;

take my rest &amp; love as she loves me BALLAD [O sigh no more love sigh no more] O sigh no more love sigh no more Nor pine for earthly treasure Who fears a shipwreck on the shore Or meets despair with pleasure Let not our wants our troubles prove Although tis winter weather Nor singly strive with what our love Can better brave together Thy love is proved thy worth is such It cannot fail to bless me If I loose thee I can't be rich Nor poor if I possess thee THE INCONSTANT SHEPHERD OR SORROWS MELODIE A maid was wooed by a haughty swain &amp; she was fair &amp; gay As ever song did sing or feign in groves of arcadie &amp; she was won though he was proud &amp; jealous was his heart His temper worked her mickle woe her beauty stood no part The eye that gazed upon her face his anger would bewray &amp; where was eye that met with such could care to turn away Smiles though of gentle kind would his stormy temper bare &amp; ere since smiles were born what heart could frown on one so fair Sad jealousy thy potion runs like fever through the veins When the drained cup falls down &amp; turns each fragment into pains Its thoughts are worse than hellebore &amp; poison berries are &amp; nought but foulest weeds themselves can thrive &amp; harbour there So she was wronged &amp; pined forlorn all through such cruelty Then on his pipe for swains can play thus sad repented he In a bower he made for her when love first grew too young to wrong &amp; now morn hung the leaves with dew as if to weep the song “O woe is me &amp; welladay how could my reason freeze So far on follys ice to stray to harbour jealousies Its bitter stream takes hold of hell on sorrows frenzy bound Nor on its shore one joy appears—all is a desert round Dark was the thoughts I bore to her whose beauty they dislimnd White was the bosom which they wronged &amp; bright the eyes they dimmed Fair was her face &amp; sweet those lips where rubys did prevail &amp; evil was those thoughts of mine that turned them both so pale &amp; her fond heart so white &amp; pure that glistened in her eye O had I known but half its worth I had not let it die I thought her artless ways were rude &amp; tryed revenge to take &amp; wronged her heart with idle gibes till it were like to break But as the ivy clasps the wall &amp; woodbine twines the tree The more I wronged the more her heart did cleave &amp; cling to me &amp; all my evil ways could do &amp; deep the wounds they made The stubborn root would loose no hold though the branches still decayed Shrinking away as shadows do decaying in decay &amp; wasting as the snow doth waste that weeps itself away For beauty ever was I wis always of gentle kind &amp; the slightest wound inflicted there must leave a scare behind So she faded on &amp; loved me still &amp; still forbore to mourn Though I made my heart seem ice her own could not forget to burn Till I sought new loves &amp; then too true to bear inconstancy It broke in deaths kind arms to rest &amp; left its pains with me For then I proved her all too true a double death to me” Then he laid down his troubled lute as weary to complain But little birds would not be still they mourned to hear the strain &amp; when he tried some merry tune soon went his fingers wrong Marring the tune as if his heart would know no other song OCEAN GLORIES —TUNE “OLD BENBOW” A BEAUTIFUL MELODIE Come all you seamen bold who have fought side to side Come gallant fellows all lend an ear Tis of an admirals fame Brave Grenville called by name How he fought on the main scorning fear till he died &amp; won a naveys fame you shall hear The first of seven ships was his own for to meet The Spaniards line of sail fifty five &amp; spite of shot &amp; ball He sailed amidst them all &amp; there his ship revenge kept at bay their whole fleet Till scarce a gallant heart beat alive Come gallant boys he cried I will lead—who will fight Lives there a soul on board that would run &amp; out their courage burst Each tried which should be first Where hell had een turned tail in despair at the sight Each rushed on glorys throne to his gun The Spanish thunder burst on their ship all around &amp; courage felt a shock so severe But like a rising sun The gloom was oer &amp; gone When Grenvilles cheer was heard English tars keep your ground I lead you on to fight not to fear Their masters brave commands they did back all along &amp; the bravest nailed the flag to the mast Brave brothers he did cry We'll fight on till we die To him the cannons noise was a song was a song &amp; thus they stood it on to the last Bold Grenville met a shot &amp; was brought to the ground &amp; courage for a while forced to bow They dressed his wounded head &amp; sorrow quickly fled When they the laurel saw springing up from the wound &amp; glory weaving wreaths for his brow For still he lived &amp; cried fight it on we will buy A victory our foes cannot reap Lay me in glorys bed On the quarter deck he said That I may face my foes &amp; command till I die &amp; then in honours grave I will sleep A tallisman to all was his sun ere it set &amp; glory they pursued to the grave They fought it on &amp; stood Till their decks were washed in blood &amp; when their shot was spent they must yield &amp; they met A fame which battles won never gave NELSON &amp; THE NILE Great Nelsons glory near the nile Set fames bright scroll on fire &amp; raised a flame in englands isle That never shall expire His empire was the ocean-world The heart of war his throne Where ever Englands flag unfurled He riegned &amp; ruled alone Wherever he wars vengance hurled There victory was his own With heart of fire that burnt the mind &amp; found its peace in strife With thoughts that did outspeed the wind &amp; met from terror life Upon the sea his element In danger he grew strong To battle as a feast he went Its thunder loud &amp; long Was music &amp; his hearts assent Beat welcome to the song The stubborn storms whose fury rends Full many a gallant mast His valour won them into friends They worshiped as he passed He led his fleet along the sea The flying foe to hail His daring filled with merry glee The spirit of the gale Who deemed him neptunes self to be &amp; spread his every sail Yet long he sought till fortunes day The first of august came When Nelson bore into the bay That deified his name But day when dared &amp; year when won My pen need not defile For victory wrote it while the sun Did hold his light &amp; smile To see how Nelson fought &amp; won The battle of the Nile The taunting foe of safety vain Their anchors cast aground Untill the mighty of the main Like a tempest gathered round &amp; they that did the world deride Now trembled at his name While rocks &amp; shores &amp; seas defied &amp; danger dared his fame To all in thunder he replied &amp; terror shrunk in shame Full soon their colours &amp; their fleet Did ruins throne bedeck Till weary ocean at his feet Seemed sinking with the wreck Their pompous ships were hurled on high &amp; on their wings of flame Told to the wondering blushing sky His glory &amp; their shame While mars in ecchoes made reply &amp; marvelled at his name The elements supprised &amp; won To view so grand a fight Drew nights black curtains from the sun Who smiled upon the sight The sea forgot its waves &amp; lay Quite still the sight to see &amp; neptune from his caves that day Looked out amazedly &amp; threw his coral crown away For Nelson ruled the sea MAY QUEEN A BALLAD Go leave your loves unsung ye swains For she that rivals all the rest Hath won the wreath of may So throw your pipes upon the plains For nature knows the fairest maid &amp; chuses Sally Grey Go wear your silks ye lady birds In russet far above you shines The lady of the May Your dresses make you what you are They cannot make you half so fair As beautys Sally Grey Go paint with artificial blooms Your cheeks from natures grace removed A rose is queen of may &amp; can ye think your mock perfumes Make ye so sweet &amp; so beloved No—look at Sally Grey Sweet as the dews unto the night As sunshine to the summer morn A lady of the may As secresy to loves delight Owns smiles more dearer far to one Who doats on Sally Grey EXPECTATION A BALLAD Tis saturday night &amp; my shepherd will come With a hollow &amp; whistle for me Be clear o ye skyes take your storm burtherns home Let no rain drench our favourite tree For I fear by the things that are hopping about Theres a sign of a storm coming on The Frog looks as black as the Toad that creeps out From under its hiding stone The cat with her tail runneth round till she reels &amp; the pigs race with mouthfulls of hay I sigh at the sight—&amp; felt sick over meals For Im lone when my shepherds away When dogs eat the grass it is sure to be rain &amp; our dogs in the orchard—een now The swallows flye lowe &amp; my heart is in pain While the flyes even maddened the cow The piegons have moped on the cote the day long &amp; the hens went to bed before noon The blackbirds long still din the woods with their song &amp; they look upon showers as a boon While they keep their nest dry in the wet hazel bush &amp; moisten their black sutty wing Did they know but my sorrows they'd quickly be hush Birds to make lovers happy should sing &amp; Ive often leaned oer the crofts mossy gate To listen birds singing at night When I for the surefooted Rover did wait &amp; rich was my bosoms delight &amp; sweet had it been now Im waiting anew Till the black snail is out from the grain But the souths ruddy clouds they have turned black &amp; blue &amp; the blackbirds are singing for rain The Thrush “wivy wit wivy wit” tother night Sung aloud in the old sallow bush &amp; I called him a pert little urchin outright To sing “heavy wet”—And the Thrush Changed his note in a moment to “cheer up” &amp; “cheer” &amp; the clouds crept away from the sun Till my shepherd he came &amp; when Thrushes I hear My heart with the music is won But the blackbird is rude &amp; insulting &amp; now The more the clouds blacken the sky The louder he sings from the green hazel bough But he may be sad bye &amp; bye For the cowboy is stooping beneath the oak tree Whose branches hang down to the ground &amp; beating his stick on the bushes to see If a bird startles out from the sound So silence is safety &amp; bird have a care Or your song will your dwelling betray For yesterday morning I saw your nest there But sung not to fright ye away &amp; now the boys near you—well done cunning bird You have ceased &amp; popt out tother side Your nest it is safe not a leaf has he stirred &amp; I have my shepherd descried LOVE OF THE FIELDS The shepherd bends musing beneath the green thorn &amp; his shag dog as black as a coal Wet with chasing the rabbits about in the corn Lies to watch them bob out of the hole In the bank—&amp; to make up the picture of morn The mare stands a knapping the foal &amp; when these delicious enchantments I see O I think what a life must the glad shepherds be Then he'll sawn by the brook where the dewberrys shoot That for all the world look as the morn Had breathed as it past—&amp; the old willow root Makes his foothold a step—&amp; the thorn Grows a staff—while he reaches a maiden the fruit Whom beauty &amp; blushes adorn &amp; when such delicious green pictures I see O who can help wishing their tennant to be Then the woodman he goes with his hatchet &amp; bill A singing old songs as he goes &amp; the wood gate it claps as twould never be still Till echo affrightens the crows In the oaks—&amp; the rabbit pops off from the hill As hid in green bushes he goes Brushing through the green ferns by the hugh spreading tree O I think what a joy must the forresters be By the old spinney gate in the green narrow lane The gipsey sits under his camp Where the woodbines are all in full blossom again &amp; the ass stands the thistle to champ On the hill—while the camp is so hid from the rain &amp; the grass is so free from the damp &amp; through the green leaves the sun gleams so divine O I cannot help wishing his pleasures were mine The shepherd enjoys all the riches of may &amp; labour grows pleasure by stealth The woodman abides in the old forest grey Amidst the green temple of health In the swale—while the gipsey he builds in a day A house without trouble or wealth &amp; when these delicious green pictures I see O I wish the fields out-of-door tennant to be To make a cot een of a hugh hollow tree Where the badger hath burrowed a den Or warp a rude camp on the molehilly lea Where the sheep bleat away from the pen On the fallows—or else in the green forest be Where the fox seeketh safety agen O I think though the world has grown old in its care I should meet with the garden of paradise there THE BOUNTY OF PROVIDENCE I think I'm as rich as a man need to be Though money nor land fortune ever left me Yet Ive that which belongs as a free common right To us all—&amp; it giveth my bosom delight To see the sun smile on my cottage &amp; bring Daily splendour as rich as he leaves with the king —Overshadowed with care I can go to the door &amp; see the sun smile till the cloud passes oer Nor land nor yet living belongs unto me Yet I can go out in the meadows &amp; see The healthy green grass—&amp; behold the shower fall As the wealth of that being that blesses us all &amp; he that feels this who can say he is poor For fortunes the birthright of joy—nothing more &amp; he that feels thus takes the wealth from the soil For the mizer owns nought but the trouble &amp; toil My power it is nothing my riches is small Yet my mind is as free as the richest of all &amp; my will to do good is as great as the best For nature she teaches this lesson at least As she looks upon me so to look upon all With a joy that would no creatures blessings forestall For the sun so exalted in glory &amp; high Bids the ant be as welcome to greet him as I Having little I'll be with that little content &amp; take fortunes gifts in the way that she meant To look at my lot as the best that could be From the troubles &amp; toil of ambition all free With an old pocket legend wearing gold to the end “He never is poor that keeps god for his friend” I look on the skies &amp; think so—for they fall One vast hope &amp; blessing alike over all DECAY A BALLAD O poesy is on the wane For fancys visions all unfitting I hardly know her face again Nature herself seems on the flitting The fields grow old &amp; common things The grass the sky the winds a blowing &amp; spots where still a beauty clings Are sighing “going all a going” O poesy is on the wane I hardly know her face again The bank with brambles overspread &amp; little molehills round about it Was more to me then laurel shades With paths &amp; gravel finely clouted &amp; streaking here &amp; streaking there Through shaven grass &amp; many a border With rutty lanes had no compare &amp; heaths were in a richer order But poesy is in its wane I hardly know her face again I sat with love by pasture streams Aye beautys self was sitting bye Till fields did more then edens seem Nor could I tell the reason why I often drank when not a dry To pledge her health in draughts divine Smiles made it nectar from the sky Love turned een water into wine O poesy is on the wane I cannot find her face again The sun those mornings used to find When clouds were other-country-mountains &amp; heaven looked upon the mind With groves &amp; rocks &amp; mottled fountains These heavens are gone—the mountains grey Turned mist—the sun a homeless ranger Pursuing on a naked way Unnoticed like a very stranger O poesy is on its wane Nor love nor joy is mine again Loves sun went down without a frown For very joy it used to grieve us I often think that west is gone Ah cruel time to undecieve us The stream it is a naked stream Where we on sundays used to ramble The sky hangs oer a broken dream The brambles dwindled to a bramble O poesy is on its wane I cannot find her haunts again Mere withered stalks &amp; fading trees &amp; pastures spread with hills &amp; rushes Are all my fading vision sees Gone gone is raptures flooding gushes When mushrooms they were fairy bowers Their marble pillars overswelling &amp; danger paused to pluck the flowers That in their swarthy rings were dwelling But poesys spells are on the wane Nor joy nor fear is mine again Aye poesy hath passed away &amp; fancys visions undecieve us The night hath taen the place of day &amp; why should passing shadows grieve us I thought the flowers upon the hills Where flowers from Adams open gardens &amp; I have had my summer thrills &amp; I have had my hearts rewardings So poesy is on its wane I hardly know her face again &amp; friendship it hath burned away Just like a very ember cooling A make believe on april day That sent the simple heart a fooling Mere jesting in an earnest way Decieving on &amp; still decieving &amp; hope is but a fancy play &amp; joy the art of true believing For poesy is on the wane O could I feel her faith again HOME HAPPINESS BALLAD Like a thing of the desert alone in its glee I make a small home seem an empire to me Like a bird in the forest whose home is its nest My home is my all &amp; the centre of rest Let ambition stride over the world at a stride Let the restless go rolling away with the tide I look on lifes pleasures as follys at best &amp; like sunset feel calm when Im going to rest I sit by the fire in the dark winters night While the cat cleans her face with her foot in delight &amp; the winds all acold with rude clatter &amp; din Shake the windows like robbers who want to come in Or else from the cold to be hid &amp; away Where the fire it burns bright &amp; my childerns at play Making houses of cards or a coach of a chair While I sit enjoying their happiness there I walk round the orchard on sweet summer eves &amp; rub the perfume from the black currant leaves Which like the geranium when touched leaves a smell That ladslove &amp; sweet briar can hardly excell &amp; watch the things grow all begemed with the shower That glitter like pearls in a sunshiny hour &amp; hear the pert robin just startle a tune To cheer the lone hedger when labour is done Joys come like the grass in the field springing there Without the mere toil of attention or care They come of them selves like a star in the sky &amp; the brighter they shine when the cloud passes bye I wish but for little &amp; find it all there Where peace gives its faith to the home of the hare Who otherwise would in her fears run away From the shade of the flower &amp; the breeze of the day O the out of door blessings of leisure for me Health riches &amp; joy—O it owns them all three There peace comes to me I have faith in her smile Shes my playmate in leisure my comfort in toil There the short pasture grass hides the lark on its nest Though scarcely so high as the grasshoppers breast &amp; there its moss ball hides the wild honey bee &amp; there joy in plenty grows riches for me Far away from the world its delusions &amp; snares Where words are but breath &amp; its breathings but cares Where troubles sown thick as the dews of the morn Can scarce set a foot without meeting a thorn There are some views the world as a light cuckaball There are some looks on citys like stones in a wall Nothing bigger—but these are ambition his heirs For which I have neither the courage or cares So I sit on my bench or enjoy in the shade My toil as a pleasure while using the spade While fancy is free in her pleasure to stray Making voyages round the whole world in a day To gather home comforts where cares never grew Like manna the heavens rain down with the dew Till I see the tired hedger bend wearily bye Then like a tired bird to my corner I flye THE MAIDENS COMPLAINT A BALLAD My partners jeer me all the May &amp; call me proud &amp; high &amp; court her not the boobys say Or bid your heart good bye &amp; all because a silly swain Left home &amp; went to sea &amp; wrote accross the pathless main To throw the cause at me He never came my heart to woo &amp; prythee what could Peggy do He walked on sundays by my side &amp; talked of fields &amp; flowers I spoke again &amp; then he sighed &amp; so he did for hours He'd praise the kerchief on my breast The ribbons on my hat But from such ways who ever guest That there was aught in that He never strove my love to woo I looked—what else could Peggy do &amp; then he'd turn his head away To get at hedgrow flowers &amp; wade for king cups in the hay &amp; so he did for hours But neer so much as gave me one Or ask for one from me Can love make language in a stone Or find a speaking tree I had not been a stone to woo What else could cruel Peggy do THE CELLAR DOOR A BALLAD By the old tavern door on the causway there lay A hogshead of stingo just rolled from a dray &amp; there stood the blacksmith awaiting a drop As dry as the cinders that lay in his shop &amp; there stood the cobler as dry as a bun Almost crackt like a bucket when left in the sun He'd wetted his knife upon pendil &amp; hone Till he'd not got a spittle to moisten the stone So ere he could work though he'd lost the whole day He must wait the new broach &amp; bemoisten his clay The cellar was empty each barrel was drained To its dregs—&amp; Sir John like a rebel remained In the street—for removal too powerful &amp; large For two or three topers to take into charge Odds zooks said a gipsey with bellows to mend Had I strength I would just be for helping a friend To walk on his legs but a child in the street Had as much power as he to put John on his feet Then up came the blacksmith Sir Barley said he I should just like to storm your old tower for a spree &amp; my strength for your strength &amp; bar your renown I'd soon try your spirit by cracking your crown &amp; the cobler he tuckt up his apron &amp; spit In his hands for a burster but devil a bit Would he move—so as yet they made nothing of land For there lay the knight like a whale in the sand Says the tinker if I could but drink of his veins I should just be as strong &amp; as stubborn again Push along said the toper the cellars adry Theres nothing to moisten the mouth of a flye Says the host we shall burn out with thirst hes so big Theres a cag of small swipes half as sour as a wig In such like extreams why extreams will come pat So lets e'en go &amp; wet all our whistles with that Says the gipsey may I never bottom a chair If I drink of small swipes while Sir Johns lying there &amp; the blacksmith he threw off his apron &amp; swore Small swipes should bemoisten his gullet no more Let it out on the floor for the dry cock-a-roach &amp; he held up his hammer with threatens to broach Sir John in his castle without leave or law &amp; suck out his blood with a reed or a straw Ere he'd soak at the swipes—&amp; he turned him to start Till the host for high treason came down a full quart Just then passed the dandy &amp; turned up his nose They'd fain had him shoved but he looked at his cloaths &amp; nipt his nose closer &amp; twirled his stick round &amp; simpered tis nuisance to lie on the ground But bacchus he laughed from the old tavern sign Saying go on thou shadow &amp; let the sun shine Then again they all tried &amp; the tinker he swore That the hogshead had grown twice as heavy or more Nay nay said the toper &amp; reeled as he spoke We're all getting weak thats the end of the joke The ploughman came up &amp; cut short his old tune Hallooed “woi” to his horses &amp; though it was june Said he'd help them an hour ere he'd keep them adry “Well done” said the blacksmith with hopes running high “He moved &amp; by jingos success to the plough Aye aye said the cobler we'll conquor him now The hogshead rolled forward the toper fell back &amp; the host laughed aloud as his sides they would crack To see the old tinkers toil make such a gap In his coat as to rend it from collar to flap But the tinker he grunted &amp; cried “fiddle dee” This garment hath been an old tennant with me &amp; a needle &amp; thread with a little good skill When Ive leisure will make it stand more weathers still Then crack went his trunks from the hip to the knee With his thrusting—no matter for nothing cared he So long as Sir John rolled along to the door He's a chip of our block said the blacksmith &amp; swore &amp; as sure as I live to drive nails in a shoe He shall have at my cost a full pitcher or two &amp; the toper he hiccuped which hindered an oath So long as he'd credit he'd pitcher them both But the host stopt to hint when he'd ordered the dray Sir Barleycorns order was purchase &amp; pay &amp; now the old knight is imprisoned &amp; taen To waste in the tavern mans cellar again &amp; now said the blacksmith let forfeits come first For the insult swipes offered or his hoops I will burst Here it is my old heartys—then drink your thirst full Said the host for the stingo is worth a strong pull Never fear for your legs if theyre broken to day Winds only blow straws dust &amp; feathers away But the cask that is full like a jiant he lies &amp; jiants alone can his spirits capsize If he lies in the path though a kings coming bye John Barleycorns mighty &amp; there will he lye Then the toper sat down with a hiccup &amp; felt If he'd still an odd coin in his pocket to melt &amp; he made a wry face for his pocket was bare —But he laughed &amp; danced up “what old boy are you there” When he felt that a stiver had got to his knee Through a hole in his fob &amp; right happy was he Says the tinker Ive brawled till no breath I have got &amp; not met with twopence to purchase a pot Says the toper Ive powder to charge a long gun &amp; a stiver Ive found when I thought I'd got none So by helping a thirsty old friend in his need Is my duty—take heart thou art welcome indeed Then the smith with his tools in Sir John made a breach &amp; the toper he hiccuped &amp; ended his speech &amp; pulled at the quart till the snob he declared When he went to drink next that the bottom was bared No matter for that said the toper &amp; grinned I had but a soak &amp; neer rested for wind Thats law said the smith with a look rather vexed But the quart was a forfeit so pay for the next Then they talked of their skill &amp; their labour till noon When the sober mans toil was exactly half done &amp; there the plough lay—people hardly could pass &amp; the horses let loose pinsoned up the short grass &amp; browsed on the bottle of flags lying there By the gipseys old budget for mending a chair The millers horse tyed to the old smithy door Stood stamping his feet by the flies bitten sore Awaiting the smith as he wanted a shoe &amp; he stampt till another fell off &amp; made two Till the miller expecting that all would get loose Went to seek him &amp; cursed him outright for a goose But he dipt his dry beak in the mug once or twice &amp; forgot all his passion &amp; toils in a trice &amp; the fly bitten horse at the old smithy post Might stamp till his shoes &amp; his legs they were lost He sung his old songs &amp; forgot his old mill Blow winds high or low she might rest at her will &amp; the cobbler in spite of his bustle for pelf Left the shop all the day to take care of itself &amp; the toper who carried his house on his head No wife to be teazing no barns to be fed Would sit out the week or the month or the year Or a lifetime so long as he'd credit or beer The ploughman he talked of his skill as divine How he could plough thurrows as straight as a line &amp; the blacksmith he swore had he but the command He could shoe the kings hunter the best in the land &amp; the cobbler declared was his skill but once seen He should soon get an order for shoes from the queen But the tinker he swore he could beat them all three For gi me a pair of old bellows says he &amp; I'll make them roar out like the wind in a storm &amp; make them blow fire out of coals hardly warm The toper said nothing but wished the quart full &amp; swore he could toss it all off at a pull Ha' done said the tinker but wit was away When the bet was to bind him he'd nothing to pay &amp; thus in the face of lifes sun &amp; shower weather They drank bragged &amp; sung &amp; got merry together The sun it went down—the last gleam from his brow Flung a smile of repose on the holiday plough The glooms they approached &amp; the dews like a rain Fell thick &amp; hung pearls on the old sorrel mane Of the horse that the miller had brought to be shod &amp; the morning awoke saw a sight rather odd For a bit of the halter still hung at the door Bit through by the horse now at feed on the moor &amp; the old tinkers budget lay still in the weather While all kept on singing &amp; drinking together REMEMBRANCES Summer pleasures they are gone like to visions every one &amp; the cloudy days of autumn &amp; of winter cometh on I tried to call them back but unbidden they are gone Far away from heart &amp; eye &amp; for ever far away Dear heart &amp; can it be that such raptures meet decay I thought them all eternal when by Langley bush I lay I thought them joys eternal when I used to shout &amp; play On its bank at “clink &amp; bandy” “chock” &amp; “taw” &amp; ducking stone Where silence sitteth now on the wild heath as her own Like a ruin of the past all alone When I used to lie &amp; sing by old eastwells boiling spring When I used to tie the willow boughs together for a “swing” &amp; fish with crooked pins &amp; thread &amp; never catch a thing With heart just like a feather—now as heavy as a stone When beneath old lea close oak I the bottom branches broke To make our harvest cart like so many working folk &amp; then to cut a straw at the brook to have a soak O I never dreamed of parting or that trouble had a sting Or that pleasures like a flock of birds would ever take to wing Leaving nothing but a little naked spring When jumping time away on old crossberry way &amp; eating awes like sugar plumbs ere they had lost the may &amp; skipping like a leveret before the peep of day On the rolly polly up &amp; downs of pleasant swordy well When in round oaks narrow lane as the south got black again We sought the hollow ash that was shelter from the rain With our pockets full of peas we had stolen from the grain How delicious was the dinner time on such a showry day O words are poor receipts for what time hath stole away The ancient pulpit trees &amp; the play When for school oer “little field” with its brook &amp; wooden brig Where I swaggered like a man though I was not half so big While I held my little plough though twas but a willow twig &amp; drove my team along made of nothing but a name “Gee hep” &amp; “hoit” &amp; “woi”—O I never call to mind These pleasant names of places but I leave a sigh behind When I see the little mouldywharps hang sweeing to the wind On the only aged willow that in all the field remains &amp; nature hides her face where theyre sweeing in their chains &amp; in a silent murmuring complains Here was commons for their hills where they seek for freedom still Though every commons gone &amp; though traps are set to kill The little homeless miners—O it turns my bosom chill When I think of old “sneap green” puddocks nook &amp; hilly snow Where bramble bushes grew &amp; the daisy gemmed in dew &amp; the hills of silken grass like to cushions to the view Where we threw the pissmire crumbs when we'd nothing else to do All leveled like a desert by the never weary plough All vanished like the sun where that cloud is passing now &amp; settled here for ever on its brow O I never thought that joys would run away from boys Or that boys would change their minds &amp; forsake such summer joys But alack I never dreamed that the world had other toys To petrify first feelings like the fable into stone Till I found the pleasure past &amp; a winter come at last Then the fields were sudden bare &amp; the sky got overcast &amp; boyhoods pleasing haunts like a blossom in the blast Was shrivelled to a withered weed &amp; trampled down &amp; done Till vanished was the morning spring &amp; set that summer sun &amp; winter fought her battle strife &amp; won By Langley bush I roam but the bush hath left its hill On cowper green I stray tis a desert strange &amp; chill &amp; spreading lea close oak ere decay had penned its will To the axe of the spoiler &amp; self interest fell a prey &amp; crossberry way &amp; old round oaks narrow lane With its hollow trees like pulpits I shall never see again Inclosure like a Buonaparte let not a thing remain It levelled every bush &amp; tree &amp; levelled every hill &amp; hung the moles for traitors—though the brook is running still It runs a nake[d] brook cold &amp; chill O had I known as then joy had left the paths of men I had watched her night &amp; day be sure &amp; never slept agen &amp; when she turned to [go] O I'd caught her mantle then &amp; wooed her like a lover by my lonely side to stay Aye knelt &amp; worshiped on as love in beautys bower &amp; clung upon her smiles as a bee upon a flower &amp; gave her heart my poesys all cropt in a sunny hour As keepsakes &amp; pledges all to never fade away But love never heeded to treasure up the may So it went the common road with decay A WORLD FOR LOVE O this world is all too rude for thee with much ado &amp; care O this world is but a rude world &amp; hurts a thing so fair Was there a nook in which the world had never been to sere That world would prove a paradise when thou &amp; love was near &amp; there to pluck the blackberry &amp; there to reach the sloe How joyously &amp; quietly would love thy partner go Then rest when weary on a bank where not a grassy blade Had ere been bent by troubles feet &amp; love thy pillow made For summer would be evergreen though sloes was in their prime &amp; winter smile his frowns to spring in beautys happy clime &amp; months would come &amp; months would go &amp; all in sunny moods &amp; every thing inspired by thee grow beautifully good &amp; there to seek a cot unknown to any care &amp; pain &amp; there to shut the door alone on singing wind &amp; rain Far far away from all the world more rude then rain or wind &amp; who could wish a sweeter home or better place to find Then thus to live &amp; love with thee thou beautiful delight Then thus to love &amp; live with thee the summer day &amp; night &amp; earth itself where thou had rest would surely smile to see Herself grow eden once again possest of love &amp; thee GOD BLESS THEE Thou lovely one thy witching face Doth win the heedless passer bye To marvel what a winning grace Hath woman in her majesty God bless thee Hearts mutter in warm youths excess &amp; with fond praise caress thee When beauty smiles can praise do less Then wish all good to bless thee Thou lovely one thy claim to good Is coeternal with the sky &amp; heaven is of thy sisterhood It shineth in thy timid eye Thy love &amp; faith an heaven hath made God bless thee Mens worship need not be affraid Though as angels they caress thee For thourt an angel ready made They cannot help but bless thee Praise cometh from thy tongue to me Music &amp; love &amp; every thing &amp; in thy faith that heaven I see That gives delight to suffering &amp; turns aside the thorns of care God bless thee In joy &amp; hope &amp; dark despair My praises did caress thee &amp; even in death I'll love thee there &amp; everlasting bless thee THE SHEPHERD When the bloom on the black thorn shines white in the sun &amp; the rook begins building her nest When the lambs round the molehillocks gambol &amp; run Then the shepherds glad toil is the best From the dust of the barn where the cobwebs in ropes Hang down from the roof &amp; the wall &amp; the thresher alone oer his dull labour mopes While the barndoor fowl cackle &amp; squall The shepherd while Dolly sits milking her cow Stands telling love tales &amp; the like Or takes a few rounds with his partner at plough &amp; then he leaps over the dyke &amp; hies him away to his sheep in the close Where the blackcap sings loud in his ear &amp; thus with his labour &amp; pleasant discourse He enjoys the new smiles of the year In the morning he lets out his sheep from the pen While the wood piegon cooes in the tree &amp; drives them away to the green springing glen Where the pewet sweeps over the lea &amp; there he roams round till the shut of the sun &amp; sees the bird building its nest &amp; when his half play &amp; half labour is done He whistles away to his rest While his dog snufts the path with a eager delight Oft starting the rabit &amp; hare Who venture the new sprouting grasses to bite As far from the wood as they dare &amp; first at the cottage he scrats at the door To tell that his master is come &amp; there the glad shepherd drops down in his chair &amp; tells his day stories at home Or takes up a book full of stories &amp; songs Reading such as his fancies admire While his childern ride cock horse on poker &amp; tongues &amp; his dog licks his feet at the fire Often musing awhile oer the comforts he feels Then to bed untill morning again When his dog is heard barking aloud at his heels As he whistles away to the plain SUMMER BALLAD Poesy now in summer stoops Full fifty times a day The green turns gold with buttercups The hedges white with may The ballad singing larks now troop By dozens from the hay &amp; dozens down as soon as up Leaves one the time to play But sweeter ballads fill the vale When maidens meet the morn &amp; the red cow stands oer the pail Beneath the squatty thorn Where sheep come up &amp; rub their heads &amp; cows lie down to chew Their cuds beneath the battered shade When grass is wet with dew The magpies nest is on the top She cannot sing—but shows Mays hurry while the maiden stops &amp; chatters till she goes The mays field ballads much would need If song was all its lot &amp; all its bustle rude indeed If beauty owned it not Morn sprinkles treasures in her way Green health in every place &amp; I thought verses half the day To pass so sweet a face Dress sets not off her face so well As it sets off her dress Love easy knows where beauty dwells If fancy bids it guess She might have sweethearts half a score &amp; that in half a year But she has one &amp; wants no more &amp; blushes when he's near From idle words she turns away &amp; frowns will fools reprove But kindness she with kindness pays Till almost ta'en for love No broaches on her breast she wears Pind down with golden pins She gives herself no foolish airs Nor feels the praise she wins Though fancy many a flounce prefers When may day comes about Pride has but small to do with her Thats rich enough without She loves on sunday noons to go Among the birds in may Where buntings “pink” “pink” [“]pink” as though They followed all the way She dances round &amp; skips the stile Rich in her sunday dress &amp; meets from every face a smile The type of happiness &amp; so delightful grows the walk With loves familiar ear Joy almost may in ballads talk When beauty listens near &amp; soon as she has past the farm &amp; eyes are out of sight She takes the waiting shepherds arm &amp; dallys with delight She loves to spend an hour or so With neighbours &amp; to see How pinks &amp; cloves &amp; lilys grow Which goody shows so free Beds edged with daisys red &amp; white &amp; thrift &amp; london pride Appears to her so fine a sight That nowhere owns beside Few are the flowers her taste prefers Yet looking up &amp; down She nips a leaf of lavender To put within her gown She loves a flower her gown to grace But asks not—&amp; recieves A nosegay sweet—for beautys face In welcomes favour lives The young their silent gifts bestow That somthing more would tell &amp; old folks happy are to show They ever wish it well She loves the garden bench at eve &amp; takes her sewing there &amp; gets by heart the last new song A present from the fair She has a love for many things But will not own to one &amp; he who sees her home at spring Is kept a secret on She loves the oak upon the green In may with apples hung For there she sits &amp; sings unseen The songs her mother sung She loves the thrush that comes to sing Upon the hedgerow bough &amp; curly coated lambs of spring That race up to the cow The shepherd dog in shaggy suit In e'er such haste will stand &amp; though the old yoe stamps her foot Awaits the patting hand The wouldbe sweetheart often drops Love welcomes in her way &amp; she her ballad only stops To pass the time of day While some would compliment her health &amp; win esteem unseen Beauty unconscious of its wealth Knows not the maid they mean She loves the green that herds the cow &amp; gives her labour joy Where she plays crookhorn even now As wild as any boy The sweetest blessings life provides Her village peace bestows Though some few towns where kin resides Is all the world she knows &amp; I could go when morning pays Green welcome to her song &amp; I could stay when evening stays Nor think her longest long &amp; lie upon the grass &amp; think &amp; in the rushes make With her sweet looks for pen &amp; ink Green ballads for her sake SONNETS SWORDY WELL Ive loved thee Swordy well &amp; love thee still Long was I with thee tenting sheep &amp; cow In boyhood ramping up each steepy hill To play at ‘roly poly’ down—&amp; now A man I trifle oer thee cares to kill Haunting thy mossy steeps to botanize &amp; hunt the orchis tribes where natures skill Doth like my thoughts run into phantasys Spider &amp; Bee all mimicking at will Displaying powers that fools the proudly wise Showing the wonders of great natures plan In trifles insignificant &amp; small Puzzling the power of that great trifle man Who finds no reason to be proud at all SUMMER MOODS I love at eventide to walk alone Down narrow lanes oerhung with dewy thorn Where from the long grass underneath—the snail Jet black creeps out &amp; sprouts his timid horn I love to muse oer meadows newly mown Where withering grass perfumes the sultry air Where bees search round with sad &amp; weary drone In vain for flowers that bloomed but newly there While in the juicey corn the hidden quail Cries ‘wet my foot’ &amp; hid as thoughts unborn The fairylike &amp; seldom-seen land rail Utters ‘craik craik’ like voices underground Right glad to meet the evenings dewy veil &amp; see the light fade into glooms around SUMMER EVENING The frog half fearful jumps accross the path &amp; little mouse that leaves its hole at eve Nimbles with timid dread beneath the swath My rustling steps awhile their joys decieve Till past—&amp; then the cricket sings more strong &amp; grasshoppers in merry moods still wear The short night weary with its fretting song Up from behind the molehill jumps the hare Cheat of its chosen bed—&amp; from the bank The yellowhammer flutters in short fears From off its nest hid in the grasses rank &amp; drops again when no more noise it hears Thus natures human link &amp; endless thrall Proud man still seems the enemy of all THE VILLAGE BOY Free from the cottage corner see how wild The village boy along the pasture hies With every smell &amp; sound &amp; sight beguiled That round the prospect meets his wondering eyes Now stooping eager for the cowslip peeps As though he'd get them all—now tired of these Accross the flaggy brook he eager leaps For some new flower his happy rapture sees Now tearing mid the bushes on his knees Or woodland banks for bluebell flowers he creeps &amp; now while looking up among the trees He spies a nest &amp; down he throws his flowers &amp; up he climbs with new fed extacies The happiest object in the summer hours EVENING SCHOOLBOYS Harken that happy shout—the schoolhouse door Is open thrown &amp; out the younkers teem Some run to leapfrog on the rushy moor &amp; others dabble in the shallow stream Catching young fish &amp; turning pebbles oer For muscle clams—Look in that mellow gleam Where the retiring sun that rests the while Streams through the broken hedge—How happy seem Those schoolboy friendships leaning oer the stile Both reading in one book—anon a dream Rich with new joys doth their young hearts beguile &amp; the books pocketed most hastily Ah happy boys well may ye turn &amp; smile When joys are yours that never cost a sigh THE DEITY Omnipotent &amp; mighty known unknown The world whose footstool is the heaven whose throne Whose is it spreads this glory all around Star studded skies &amp; flower bewildered ground Who is it speaks these wonders &amp; they be Who is it all omnipotent but thee Thou breathed upon the sun thy powers desire &amp; instant kindled his eternal fire Thou badest the unpillared skies their arch expand Thy breath is underneath them &amp; they stand Thou badest the seas in tides to rise &amp; fall &amp; earth to swell triumphant over all Thy mercey coeternal with thy skill Saw all was good &amp; bids it flourish still SUNDAY EVENING Religion never more calm beauty wears Than when each cottage joins in sunday prayers The poor man in his ignorance of ill His Bible reads with unpretending skill Unused to argue strange conflicting creeds He puts plain comments to the page he reads Though venturing not in warm enthusiasts ways To offer his own ignorance for praise He in his Prayer books beautious homilies His simple reverence to his God reveals &amp; while his listening childern clasp his knees A parents blessing from his bosom steals Prayers are the wings on which the soul doth fly To gather blessings from a bounteous sky ON A SKULL Lifes monitor &amp; fear inspiring friend Picture of our frail origin &amp; end Is thine deaths quiet sleep—tis horrible With worms &amp; dust &amp; coffined bones to dwell Dost lie in fear of waking wrapt around In deaths dark sealed impenetrable cloud Dost ever dream &amp; speak without a sound Twould make deaths self to shudder in his shroud Thy shadows hangeth like a gloomy pall With more or less of terror over all Life looking on this glass of time doth freeze With fear at its own image which its sees To think the living head with thoughts so full Is but the flattered portrait of a skull SEDGE BIRDS NEST Fixed in a white thorn bush its summer guest So low een grass oertopt its tallest twig A sedge bird built its little benty nest Close by the meadow pool &amp; wooden brig Where schoolboys every morn &amp; eve did pass In robbing birds &amp; cunning deeply skilled Searching each bush &amp; taller clump of grass Where ere was liklihood of bird to build Yet did she hide her habitation long &amp; keep her little brood from dangers eye Hidden as secret as a crickets song Till they well fledged oer widest pools could flye Proving that providence is often bye To guard the simplest of her charge from wrong THE SHEPHERDS TREE Hugh Elm thy rifted trunk all notched &amp; scarred Like to a warriors destiny I love To stretch me often on such shadowd sward &amp; hear the laugh of summer leaves above Or on thy buttressed roots to sit &amp; lean In carless attitude—&amp; there reflect On times &amp; deeds &amp; darings that have been Old cast aways now swallowed in neglect While thou art towering in thy strength of heart Stirring the soul to vain imaginings In which lifes sordid being hath no part The wind of that eternal ditty sings Humming of future things that burns the mind To leave some fragment of itself behind AN IDLE HOUR Sauntering at ease I often love to lean Oer old bridge walls &amp; mark the flood below Whose ripples through the weeds of oily green Like happy travellers mutter as they go &amp; mark the sunshine dancing on the arch Time keeping to the merry waves beneath &amp; on the banks see drooping blossoms parch Thirsting for water in the days hot breath Right glad of mud drops plashed upon their leaves By cattle plunging from the steepy brink While water flowers more than their share recieve &amp; revel to their very cups in drink Just like the world some strive &amp; fare but ill While others riot &amp; have plenty still THE SHEPHERD BOY Pleased in his lonliness he often lies Telling glad stories to his dog—&amp; een His very shadow that the loss supplies Of living company. Full oft he'll lean By pebbled brooks &amp; dream with happy eyes Upon the fairey pictures spread below Thinking the shadowed prospect real skies &amp; happy heavens where his kindred go Oft we may track his haunts where he hath been To spend the leisure which his toils bestow By ‘nine peg morris’ nicked upon the green Or flower stuck gardens never meant to grow Or figures cut on trees his skill to show Where he a prisoner from a shower hath been LORD BYRON A splendid sun hath set when shall our eyes Behold a morn so beautiful arise As that which gave his mighty genius birth &amp; all eclipsed the lesser lights on earth His first young burst of twilight did declare Beyond that haze a sun was rising there As when the morn to usher in the day Speeds from the east in sober garb of grey At first till warming into wild delight She casts her mantle off &amp; shines in light The labours of small minds an age may dream &amp; be but shadows on times running stream While genius in an hour makes what shall be The next a portion of eternity ON SEEING THE BUST OF THE PRINCESS VICTORIA BY BEHNES Sweet opening vision of a royal line How many hopes &amp; anxious thoughts arise That time must in her mysterys define How many pleasing fancies fill our eyes While musing thus &amp; gazing upon thine That open look the artist sweetly caught Turned upward as to view the beaming sky In all that rich young vacancy of thought That makes man envy early infancy Sweetly concieved &amp; exquisitly wrought The statue even childhoods joy imparts &amp; sculptures genius makes a proud display Life almost from the chilly marble starts &amp; beauty breaths reality in clay EVENING PASTIME Musing beside the crackling fire at night While singing kettle merrily prepares Womans solacing beverage I delight To read a pleasant volume where the cares Of life are sweetened by the muses voice— Thompson or Cowper or the Bard that bears Lifes humblest name though natures favoured choice Her pastoral Bloomfield—&amp; as evening wears Weary with reading list the little tales Of laughing childern who edge up their chairs To tell the past days sport which never fails To cheer the spirits—while my fancy shares Their artless talk mans sturdy reason fails &amp; memorys joy grows young again with theirs NATURE How many pages of sweet natures book Hath poesy doubled down as favoured things Such as the wood leaves in disorder shook By startled stockdoves hasty clapping wings Or green woodpecker that soft tapping clings To grey oak trunks till scared by passing clowns It bounces forth in airy ups &amp; downs To seek fresh solitudes the circling rings The idle puddock makes around the towns Watching young chickens by each cottage pen &amp; such are each days party coloured skies &amp; such the landscapes charms oer field &amp; fen That meet the poets never weary eyes &amp; are too many to be told agen THE WREN Why is the cuckoos melody preferred &amp; nightingales rich song so fondly praised In poets ryhmes Is there no other bird Of natures minstrelsy that oft hath raised Ones heart to extacy &amp; mirth as well I judge not how anothers taste is caught With mine theres other birds that bear the bell Whose song hath crowds of happy memories brought Such the wood Robin singing in the dell &amp; little Wren that many a time hath sought Shelter from showers in huts where I did dwell In early spring the tennant of the plain Tenting my sheep &amp; still they come to tell The happy stories of the past again A SPRING MORNING Spring cometh in with all her hues &amp; smells In freshness breathing over hills &amp; dells Oer woods where May her gorgeous drapery flings &amp; meads washed fragrant with their laughing springs Fresh as new opened flowers untouched &amp; free From the bold rifling of the amorous bee The happy time of singing birds is come &amp; loves lone pilgrimage now finds a home Among the mossy oaks now coos the dove &amp; the hoarse crow finds softer notes for love The foxes play around their dens &amp; bark In joys excess mid woodland shadows dark &amp; flowers join lips below &amp; leaves above &amp; every sound that meets the ear is love TO A FRIEND—IN ILLNESS In friendships gentle name that claims akin With poesys warmth its feelings to explain Lady my feeble pen would fainly win The welcome praises from thy lips again Although the Muse shrinks from my hand the while That with weak hold would yet her stay detain Mingling sad tears with every withering smile Dreaming of pleasures past &amp; present pain— Telling my sick heart that its hopes are vain Wishing for health it neer may know again Well I can better bear my sinking lot Knowing that when my life shall cease to be My very faults though known shall be forgot &amp; my poor memory find a friend in thee SPRING Now that the spring the quickening earth espouses &amp; natures feathered folk keep holiday Each with sweet song in bush &amp; tree carouses Who would not from dull citys flee away From smoke enveloped streets &amp; gloomy houses To fields where forth healths merry maidens fare To milk their red cows &amp; when that be done To spend in sport the time they have to spare Pressing the gold locks of the enarmoured sun On pleasant banks with young love toying there &amp; whoso wisheth for a blest estate That in the golden mean would fear no fall Need neither wish to be or rich or great While a poor milk maid lives enjoying all AUTUMN Me it delights in mellow autumn tide To mark the pleasaunce that mine eye surrounds The forest trees like coloured posies pied The uplands mealy grey &amp; russet grounds Seeking for joy where joyance most abounds Not found I ween in courts &amp; halls of pride Where folly feeds on flatterys sights &amp; sounds &amp; with sick heart but seemeth to be merry True pleasaunce is with humble food supplied Like shepherd swain who plucks the bramble berry With savoury appetite from hedgerow briars Then drops content by molehills sunny side Proving therebye low joys &amp; small desires Are easiest fed &amp; soonest satisfied TO A YOUNG LADY Maiden the blooms of happiness surround thee The worlds bright side like thy young visions fair Gay &amp; unclouded smile in raptures round thee With joys unconscious of encroaching care The poesy of life hath sweetly found thee Ah would thy sunshine had no clouds to share &amp; the young flowers with which her joys have crowned thee Would they were dreams as lasting as theyre fair But nature maiden hath its winter—care Or more or less in ambush waits to wound thee Then cheat thy gentle heart with no frail token From witching hope—far better joys pursue I know her closest bonds are easy broken &amp; feel the picture I have drawn too true CROWLAND ABBEY In sooth it seems right awful &amp; sublime To gaze by moonlight on the shattered pile Of this old abbey struggling still with time The grey owl hooting from its rents the while &amp; tottering stones as wakened by the sound Crumbling from arch &amp; battlement around— Urging dread echoes from the gloomy aisle To sink more silent still—The very ground In desolations garment doth appear— The lapse of age &amp; mystery profound— We gaze on wrecks of ornamented stones On tombs whose sculptures half erased appear &amp; rank weeds battening over human bones Till even ones very shadow seems to feel a fear A PLEASANT PLACE Now summer cometh I with staff in hand Will hie me to the sabbath of her joys— To heathy spots &amp; the unbroken land Of woodland heritage unknown to noise &amp; toil—save many a playful band Of dancing insects that well understand The sweets of life &amp; with attuned voice Sing in sweet concert to the pleasant may There by a little bush I'll listening rest To hear the nightingale a lovers lay Chaunt by his mate who builds her carless nest Of oaken leaves on thorn stumps mossed &amp; grey Feeling with them I too am truly blest By making sabbaths of each common day VANITY OF FAME What boots the toil to follow common fame With youths wild visions of anxiety &amp; waste a life to win a feeble claim Upon her page which she so soon turns bye To make new votaries room who share the same Rewards—&amp; with her faded memories lie Neighbours to shadows—tis a sorry game To play in earnest with—to think ones name Buoyant with visions of eternity &amp; as familiar now in the worlds ear As flowers &amp; sunshine to the summers eye Shall be forgot with other things that were &amp; like old words grown out of use thrown by In the confused lap of still obscurity MEMORY I would not that my being all should die &amp; pass away with every common lot I would not that my humble dust should lie In quite a strange &amp; unfrequented spot By all unheeded &amp; by all forgot With nothing save the heedless winds to sigh &amp; nothing but the dewy morn to weep About my grave far hid from the worlds eye I feign would have some friend to wander nigh &amp; find a path to where my ashes sleep Not the cold heart that merely passes bye To read who lieth there but such that keep Past memories warm with deeds of other years &amp; pay to friendship some few friendly tears DEATH OF BEAUTY Now thou art gone the fairey rose is fled That erst gay fancys garden did adorn Thou wert the dew on which their folly fed The sun by which they glittered in the morn Now thou art gone their pride is withered The dress of common weeds their youth bewray Now vanity neglects them in her play Thou wert the very index of their praise Their borrowed bloom all kindled from thy rays Like dancing insects that the sun alures They little heeded it was gained from thee Vain joys what are they now their suns away What but poor shadows that blank night obscures As the grave hideth &amp; dishonours thee FAME Whats future fame a melody loud playing In crowds where one is wanting whose esteeming Would love to hear it best—a sun displaying A solitary glory whose bright beaming Smiles upon withered flowers &amp; lone delaying Lingers behind its world—a crown vain gleaming Around a shade whose substance death hath banished A living dream oer which hope once was dreaming A busy echoe on each lip delaying When he that woke it into life is vanished A picture that from all eyes praise is stealing A statue towering over glorys game That cannot feel while he that was all feeling Is past &amp; gone &amp; nothing but a name TO THE MEMORY OF BLOOMFIELD Some feed on living fame with consious pride &amp; in that gay ship popularity They stem with painted oars the hollow tide Proud of the buzz which flatterys aids supply Joined with to days sun gilded butterfly The breed of fashion haughtily they ride As though her breath were immortality Which is but bladder puffs of common air Or water bubbles that are blown to die Let not their fancys think tis muses fare While feeding on the publics gross supply Times wave rolls on—mortality must share A mortals fate &amp; many a fame shall lie A dead wreck on the shore of dark posterity Sweet unassuming minstrel not to thee The dazzling fashions of the day belong Natures wild pictures field &amp; cloud &amp; tree &amp; quiet brooks far distant from the throng In murmurs tender as the toiling bee Make the sweet music of thy gentle song Well nature owns thee let the crowd pass by The tide of fashion is a stream too strong For pastoral brooks that gently flow &amp; sing But nature is their source &amp; earth &amp; sky Their annual offerings to her current bring Thy gentle muse &amp; memory need no sigh For thine shall murmur on to many a spring When their proud streams are summer bur[n]t &amp; dry The shepherd musing oer his summer dreams The mayday wild flowers in the meadow grass The sunshine sparkling in the valley streams The singing ploughman &amp; hay making lass— These live the summer of thy rural themes Thy green memorials these &amp; they surpass The cobweb praise of fashion—every may Shall find a native “Giles” beside his plough Joining the skylarks song at early day &amp; summer rustling in the ripening corn Shall meet thy rustic loves as sweet as now Offering to Marys lips the “brimming horn” &amp; seasons round thy humble grave shall be Fond lingering pilgrims to remember thee BEAUTY Daughters of england where has nature given Creatures like you so delicately formed Ye earthly types of beauty in its heaven With tender thoughts &amp; blushes ever warmed Where is the heart with apathy so blessed That womans beauty failed to lead astray Where is the eye can for a moment rest On beautys face &amp; calmly turn away O lovely woman muse of many themes The sweet reality of fancys dreams Where is the soul that never lost its rest Nor felt the thrilling aching &amp; the strife From stolen glances on a heaving breast As white as marble statues warmed with life THE MARCH NIGHTINGALE Now sallow catkins once all downy white Turn like the sunshine into golden light The rocking clown leans oer the spinny rail In admiration at the sunny sight The while the Blackcap doth his ears assail With such a rich &amp; such an early song He stops his own &amp; thinks the nightingale Hath of her monthly reckoning counted wrong “Sweet jug jug jug” comes loud upon his ear Those sounds that unto may by right belong Yet on the awthorn scarce a leaf appears How can it be—spell struck the wondering boy Listens again—again the sound he hears &amp; mocks it in his song for very joy THE THRUSHES NEST Within a thick &amp; spreading awthorn bush That overhung a molehill large &amp; round I heard from morn to morn a merry thrush Sing hymns to sunrise while I drank the sound With joy &amp; often an intruding guest I watched her secret toils from day to day How true she warped the moss to form her nest &amp; modelled it within with wood &amp; clay &amp; bye &amp; bye like heathbells gilt with dew There lay her shining eggs as bright as flowers Ink spotted over shells of greeny blue &amp; there I witnessed in the sunny hours A brood of natures minstrels chirp &amp; flye Glad as that sunshine &amp; the laughing sky THE SYCAMORE In massy foliage &amp; a sunny green The splendid sycamore adorns the spring Adding rich beauty to the varied scene That natures breathing arts alone can bring Hark how the insects hum around &amp; sing Like happy ariels hid from heedless view &amp; merry bees that feed with eager wing On the broad leaves glazed oer with honey dew The fairey sunshine gently flickers through Upon the grass &amp; buttercups below &amp; in its foliage winds their sport renew Waving romantic shadows too &amp; fro That oer the mind in sweet disorder flings A flitting dream of beauties fading things THE CRABTREE Spring comes anew &amp; brings each little pledge That still as wont my childish heart decieves I stoop again for violets in the hedge Among the Ivy &amp; old withered leaves &amp; often mark amid the clumps of sedge The pooty shells I gathered when a boy But cares have claimed me many an evil day &amp; chilled the relish which I had for joy Yet when crab blossoms blush among the may As wont in years gone bye I scramble now Up mid the brambles for my old esteems Filling my hands with many a blooming bough Till the heart stirring past as present seems Save the bright sunshine of those fairey dreams WINTER Old January clad in crispy rime Comes trampling on &amp; often makes a stand The hasty snowstorm neer disturbs his time He mends no pace but beats his dithering hand &amp; Febuery like a timid maid Smiling &amp; sorrowing follows in his train Huddled in cloak of mirey roads affraid She hastens on to greet her home again Then march the prophetess by storms inspired Gazes in rapture on the troubled sky &amp; then in headlong fury madly fired She bids the hail storm boil &amp; hurry bye Yet neath the blackest cloud a sunbeam flings Its cheering promise of returning springs THE BEANS IN BLOSSOM The southwest wind how pleasant in the face It breaths while sauntering in a musing pace I roam these new ploughd fields &amp; by the side Of this old wood where happy birds abide &amp; the rich blackbird through his golden bill Utters wild music when the rest are still Now luscious comes the scent of blossomed beans That oer the path in rich disorder leans Mid which the bees in busy songs &amp; toils Load home luxuriantly their yellow spoils The herd cows toss the mole hills in their play &amp; often stand the strangers steps at bay Mid clover blossoms red &amp; tawney white Strong scented with the summers warm delight BOYS AT PLAY The shepherd boys play by the shaded stile While sunshine gleams with warm &amp; idle smile Or hide neath hedges where the linnets sing &amp; leaves spread curtains round the bubbling spring While winds with idle dalliance wave the woods &amp; toy with nature in her youthful moods Fanning the feathers on the linnets breast &amp; happy maid in lightsome garments drest Sweeping her gown in many an armorous shade As if enarmoured of the form displayed Upon the southwest wind the boiling showers Bring sweet arivance of all sorts of flowers Enjoying like the laughing boys at play Sabbaths of sunshines outdoor holiday THE SHEPHERDS FIRE On the rude heath yclad in furze &amp; ling &amp; oddling thorn that thick &amp; prickly grows Shielding the shepherd when the rude wind blows &amp; boys that sit right merry in a ring Round fires upon a molehill toasting sloes &amp; crabs that froth &amp; frizzle on the coals Loud is the gabble &amp; the laughter loud The rabbits scarce dare peep from out their holes Unwont to mix with such a noisey crowd Some run to eke the fire—while many a cloud Of smoke curls up some on their haunches squat With mouth for bellows puffing till it flares Or if that fail one fans his napless hat &amp; when the feast is done they squabble for their shares NOVEMBER Sybil of months &amp; worshipper of winds I love thee rude &amp; boisterous as thou art &amp; scraps of joy my wandering ever finds Mid thy uproarious madness—when the start Of sudden tempests stir the forrest leaves Into hoarse fury till the shower set free Still the hugh swells &amp; ebb the mighty heaves That swing the forrest like a troubled sea I love the wizard noise &amp; rave in turn Half vacant thoughts &amp; self imagined rhymes Then hide me from the shower a short sojourn Neath ivied oak &amp; mutter to the winds Wishing their melody belonged to me That I might breath a living song to thee OLD POESY Sweet is the poesy of the olden time In the unsullied infancy of rhyme When nature reigned omnipotent to teach &amp; truth &amp; feeling owned the powers of speech Rich is the music of each early theme &amp; sweet as sunshine in a summer dream Giving to stocks &amp; stones in raptures strife A soul of utterance &amp; a tongue of life Sweet wild flower images in disarray Which art &amp; fashion fling as weeds away To sport with shadows of inferior kind Mere magic lanthorns of the shifting mind Automatons of wonder working powers Shadows for life &amp; artificial flowers To turn from music of this modern art To fames old pages that real life impart We seem as startled from unnatural dreams To hear the summer voice of woods &amp; streams &amp; feel the sunny air right green &amp; young Breath music round as though a syren sung &amp; greet as arts vain painted scenes are bye The soul stirred impulse of a living sky As in long draughts of summers parched hours Falls the refreshment of great rains &amp; showers The birds resume their song the leaves their green &amp; brooks as long dry as the land hath been Brimful of the skys bounty gladly go Seeming to sing &amp; wonder why they flow TO DEWINT Dewint I would not flatter nor would I Pretend to critic skill in this thine art Yet in thy landscapes I can well descry Thy breathing hues as natures counterpart No painted freaks—no wild romantic sky No rocks nor mountains as the rich sublime Hath made thee famous but the sunny truth Of nature that doth mark thee for all time Found on our level pastures spots forsooth Where common skill sees nothing deemed divine Yet here a worshipper was found in thee Where thy young pencil worked such rich surprise That rushy flats befringed with willow tree Rival'd the beauties of italian skies A LIVING PICTURE Her hair was swarthy brown &amp; soft of hue As the sweet gloom that falls with evens dew That on her fine white forhead did divide In the triumphant negligence of pride Her eyes were dark but they wore lights to shine That love adores &amp; poets call divine &amp; her cheeks summer blooms wore hues the while Of loves soft innosence without its guile &amp; on the pouting of her amorous lip Where love delicious nectar longed to sip Beauty sat throned in that bewitching spell That love adores &amp; language cannot tell Where charms triumphant made each gazer pay Heartaches for looking—ere he turned away POESY A MAYING Now comes the bonny May dancing &amp; skipping Across the stepping stones of meadow streams Bearing no kin to april showers a weeping But constant sunshine as her servant seems Her heart is up—her sweetness all a maying Streams in her face like gems on beautys breast The swains are sighing all &amp; well adaying Love sick &amp; gazing on their lovely guest The sunday paths to pleasant places leading Are graced by couples linking arm in arm Sweet smiles enjoying or some book a reading Where love &amp; beauty are the constant charm For while the bonny May is dancing bye Beauty delights the ear &amp; beauty fills the eye The birds they sing &amp; build &amp; nature scorns On Mays young festival to keep a widow There childern too have pleasures all their own A plucking ladysmocks along the meadow The little brook sings loud among the pebbles So very loud that waterflowers which lie Where many a silver curdle boils &amp; dribbles Dance too with joy as it goes singing bye Among the pasture molehills maidens stoop To pluck the luscious majoram for their bosoms The greenswards smothered oer with buttercups &amp; white thorns they are breaking down with blossoms Tis natures livery for the bonny May Who keeps her court &amp; all have holiday Princess of months—so natures choice ordains &amp; lady of the summer still she reigns In spite of aprils youth who charms in tears &amp; rosey June who wins with blushing face July sweet shepherdess who wreaths the shears Of shepherds with her flowers of winning grace &amp; suntanned august with her swarthy charms The beautiful &amp; rich—&amp; pastoral gay September with her pomp of fields &amp; farms &amp; wild novembers sybilline array In spite of beautys calender the year Garlands with beautys prize the bonny May Where'er she goes fair nature hath no peer &amp; months do loose their queen when shes away Up like a princess starts the merry morning In draperies of many coloured cloud &amp; skylarks minstrels of the early dawning Pipe forth their hearty anthems long &amp; loud The bright enarmoured sunshine goes a maying &amp; every flower his laughing eye beguiles &amp; on the milkmaids rosey face a playing Pays court to beauty in his softest smiles For mays divinity of joy begun Adds life &amp; lustre to the golden sun &amp; all of life beneath its glory straying Is by mays beauty into worship won Till golden eve ennobles all the west &amp; day goes blushing like a bride to rest TO CHARLES LAMB Friend Lamb thou chusest well to love the lore Of our old bygone bards whose racey page Rich mellowing Time made sweeter then before The blossom left for the long garnered store Of fruitage now right luscious in its age Although to fashions taste—what more Can be expected from the popular rage For tinsels gauds that are to gold preferred Me much it grieved as I did erst presage Vain fashions foils had every heart deterred From the warm homely phrase of other days Untill thy muses auncient voice I heard &amp; now right fain yet fearing honest bard I pause to greet thee with so poor a praise BOSTON CHURCH Majestic pile thy rich &amp; splendid tower Oerlooks the ocean with aspiring pride Dareing the insults rude of wind &amp; shower &amp; greeting time with presence dignified Firm as a rock yet seems thy massy power Though thou hast seen prides mightiest thrust aside &amp; ages crumble at thy feet in dust &amp; the proud sea claim as her rightful dower Wrecks of its thousand ships to hold in trust As dark oblivions harvests of the storm Yet waves may lash &amp; the loud hurricane Threaten thy cloud crowned dwelling—&amp; deform The sky in glooms around thee—all is vain Empires may pass away but thoult remain Smiling in sunshine as the storm frowns bye Whose dreadful rage seemed to thy quiet thrall As small birds twitterings that beneath thee flye Winds call aloud &amp; they may louder call For deaf to dangers voice sublime &amp; grand Thou towerest in thy old majesty oer all Tempests that break the tall mast like a wand Howl their rage weary round thee &amp; no more Impression makes than summer winds that bow The little trembling weeds upon thy wall Lightenings have seared their centurys round thy brow &amp; left no footmarks—so in shadows hoar Time decks &amp; spares thee till that doom is hurled That sears the ocean dry &amp; wrecks the world ISAAC WALTON Some blame thee honest Isaac—aye &amp; deem Thy pastime cruel by the silent stream Of the unwooded Lea—but he that warms In eloquence of grief oer suffering worms Throws by his mourning quill &amp; hunts the hare Whole hours to death yet feels no sorrow there Yet this mock sentimental man of moods On every pastime but his own intrudes Not so with thee thou man of angel mind That like thy master gentle was &amp; kind Fit emblem of the prime apostles days &amp; worthy even of the scripture praise &amp; men of Gods own heart must surely be Such honest soul that most resemble thee NUTTING The sun had stooped his westward clouds to win Like weary traveller seeking for an Inn When from the hazelly wood we glad descried The ivied gateway by the pasture side Long had we sought for nutts amid the shade Where silence fled the rustle that we made When torn by briars &amp; brushed by sedges rank We left the wood &amp; on the velvet bank Of short sward pasture ground we sat us down To shell our nutts before we reached the town The near hand stubble field with mellow glower Showed the dimmed blaze of poppys still in flower &amp; sweet the molehills smelt we sat upon &amp; now the thymes in bloom but where is pleasure gone THE WOODMAN Now evening comes &amp; from the new laid hedge The woodman rustles in his leathern guise Hiding in dyke ylined with brustling sedge His bill &amp; mittins from thefts meddling eyes &amp; in his wallets storeing many a pledge Of flowers &amp; boughs from early sprouting trees &amp; painted pootys from the ivied hedge About its mossy roots—his boys to please Who wait with merry joy his coming home Anticipating presents such as these Gained far afield where they nor night nor morn Find no school leisure long enough to go Where flowers but rarely from their stalks are torn &amp; birds scarce loose a nest the season through SHADOWS The fairest summer hath its sudden showers The clearest sky is never without clouds &amp; in the painted meadows host of flowers Some lurking weed in poisonous death enshrouds Sweet days that upon golden sunshine springs A gloomy night in mourning waits to stain The honey bees are girt with sharpest stings &amp; sweetest joys oft breed severest pains While like to autumns storms sudden &amp; brief Mirths parted lips oft close in silent grief Amid this checkered lifes dissasterous state Where hope lives green amid the desolate As nature in her happy livery waves Oer ancient ruins pallaces &amp; graves MORNING PLEASURES The dewy virtues of the early morn Breaths rich of health &amp; leads the mind to joy While like a thrilling pleasure newly born Each little hamlet wakes its shouting boy Right earlily to wander out afield &amp; brush the dewdrops from the bending corn To see what nests the hedgerow thorns may shield Or gather cuckoos from the neighbouring lawn Where mid the dark Dog mercury that abounds Round each mossed stump the woodlark hides her nest &amp; delicate bluebell that her home surrounds Bows its soft fragrance oer her spotted breast Till from the boys rude steps she startled flies Who turns the weeds away &amp; vainly seeks the prize HONESTY There is a valued though a stubborn weed That blooms but seldom &amp; thats found but rare In sunless places where it cannot seed Would earth for truths sake had more room to spare Cant hates it—hypocrites condemn it—&amp; the herd Seeking self interest frown &amp; pass it bye Tis trampled on—tis bantered—&amp; deterred Tis scoffed—&amp; mocked at—yet it doth not die But like a diamond for a century lost Buried in darkness &amp; obscurity When found again it looses not in cost But keeps its value &amp; its purity By time unsullied—still the prince of gems &amp; first of jewels in all diadems The rich man claims it—but he often buys Its substitute that is not what it seems While poverty enobled in disguise Its simple bloom oft worships &amp; esteems Knaves boast possesion—but they forge its name Mobs laud &amp; praise it—but with them tis noise Or the mere passport for some hidden game Beneath whose garb self interest lurks &amp; lies Tis by the good man only deemed a prize Too valued to be scoffed at or opprest Tis ever more respected by the wise Though thousands treat it as a common jest &amp; that thou mayest not slight so grand a dower Tis honesty go thou &amp; wear the flower HAYMAKING Tis haytime &amp; the red complexioned sun Was scarcely up ere blackbirds had begun Along the meadow hedges here &amp; there To sing loud songs to the sweet smelling air Where breath of flowers &amp; grass &amp; happy cow Fling oer ones senses streams of fragrance now While in some pleasant nook the swain &amp; maid Lean oer their rakes &amp; loiter in the shade Or bend a minute oer the bridge &amp; throw Crumbs in their leisure to the fish below —Hark at that happy shout—&amp; song between Tis pleasures birthday in her meadow scene What joy seems half so rich from pleasure won As the loud laugh of maidens in the sun SLANDER There is a viper that doth hide its head In the recesses of the human heart There is a serpent that doth make its bed On manhoods prime &amp; Gods own counterpart It feeds upon the honours of the great It mars the reputation of the just It eats its being into worths estate &amp; levels all distinctions in the dust Goodness is smitten by its bitter gibes Greatness is wounded by the slime it breeds It lives the worst of all its evil tribes For poisonous actions &amp; for damning deeds Nay slanders keener then a serpents breath It poisons deeper &amp; it brings not death It feeds on falshood &amp; on clamour lives &amp; truth like sunshine waters in its eyes It cannot bear the searching light she gives But in her splendour—struggles—wreaths—&amp; lies A crushed &amp; wounded worm that vainly turns All ways for rest &amp; ease &amp; findeth none Of its own venom breath it wastes &amp; burns Away—like putrid waters to the sun —Its stains as footmarks in a frosty morn Left on the bruising grass by early swain Truths Spring soon comes &amp; laughs them all to scorn Stains dissapear &amp; grass is green again So hearts that feed the falshood slander frames Are all that wear at last the venom of its fames STEPPING STONES The stepping stones that stride the meadow streams Look picturesque amid springs golden gleams Where steps the traveller with a warey pace &amp; boy with laughing leisure in his face Sits on the midmost stone in very whim To catch the struttles that beneath him swim While those accross the hollow lakes are bare &amp; winter floods no more rave dangers there But mid the scum left where it roared &amp; fell The schoolboy hunts to find the pooty shell Yet there the boisterous geese with golden broods Hiss fierce &amp; daring in their summer moods The boys pull off their hats while passing bye In vain to fright—themselves being forced to fly THE GARDEN BENCH I sit to see the landscape fade away In musing shadows with departing day Leaving the shepherds storys half untold While weary flocks go bleating to the fold &amp; midges dancing in the evening sun Bids labour welcome that its toil is done A wonted quiet oer the bosom steals Which calm seclusive quiet ever feels Glad as the hope that meets a lovers smile Or sweet as labour resting from its toil &amp; sweet it is some pleasant tale to weave Neath the swart twilight of a summers eve Of some sweet being that in thought doth move An angels beauty with a womans love PLEASANT PLACES Old stone pits with veined ivy overhung Wild crooked brooks oer which was rudely flung A rail &amp; plank that bends beneath the tread Old narrow lanes where trees meet overhead Path stiles on which a steeple we espy Peeping &amp; stretching in the distant sky &amp; heaths oerspread with furze blooms sunny shine Where wonder pauses to exclaim “divine” Old ponds dim shadowed with a broken tree These are the picturesque of taste to me While painting winds to make compleat the scene In rich confusion mingles every green Waving the sketchy pencil in their hands Shading the living scenes to fairey lands THE HAIL STORM IN JUNE 1831 Darkness came oer like chaos—&amp; the sun As startled with the terror seemed to run With quickened dread behind the beetling cloud The old wood sung like nature in her shroud &amp; each old rifted oak trees mossy arm Seemed shrinking from the presence of the storm &amp; as it nearer came they shook beyond Their former fears—as if to burst the bond Of earth that bound them to that ancient place Where danger seemed to threaten all their race Who had withstood all tempests since their birth Yet now seemed bowing to the very earth Like reeds they bent like drunken men they reeled Till man from shelter ran &amp; sought the open field ETERNITY OF TIME Eternal grand eternity of time Where things of greatest standing grow sublime Less from long fames &amp; universal praise Then wearing as the “ancients of old days” The word once speaking seems but half the way To reach that night leap of eternal day The Milton centurys each a mighty boast The shakspear eras—worlds without their host Engraved up[on] the adamant of fame By pens of steal in characters of flame To whom the forrest oaks eternal stay Are but as points &amp; commas in their way These less then nothings are to ruins doom When suns grow dark &amp; earth a vast &amp; lonely tomb THE POESY OF FLOWERS What would the rosey be but as the rose A merely sweet undignifying flower But cloathed by womans dignifying grace It looks upon us with a living power Then quickly every blush from beauty glows As mirrors—there reflecting beautys face Her lips &amp; luscious cheeks shine in its leaves &amp; in the lily—there her bosom heaves Flowers thus personify the hearts delight &amp; beauty gives us rapture in their sight Flowers merely flowers—would seem but cold esteems With heart-associations &amp; love-dreams But mixed like life with mind—where ere we roam They link like houshold feelings with our home THE FAIREY RINGS Here in the greensward &amp; the old molehills Where ploughshares never come to hurt the things Antiquity hath charge of—fear instills Her footsteps—&amp; the ancient fairey rings Shine black &amp; fresh &amp; round—the gipseys fire Left yesternight scarce leaves more proof behind Of midnight sports when they from day retire As in these rings my fancy seems to find Of fairey revels—&amp; I stoop to see Their little footmarks in each circling stain &amp; think I hear them in their summer glee Wishing for night that they may dance again Till shepherds tales told neath the leaning tree While shunning showers seem bible truths to me Aye almost scripture truths my poorer mind Grows into worship of these mysterys While fancys doth her ancient scrolls unbind That time hath hid in countless centurys &amp; when the mornings mist doth leave behind The fuzball round &amp; mushroom white as snow They strike me—in romantic moods enshrined As shadows of things modeled long ago Halls palaces &amp; marble columned domes &amp; modern shades of faireys ancient homes Erected in these rings &amp; pastures still For midnight balls &amp; revelry—&amp; then Left like the ruins of all ancient skill To wake the wonder of more common men THE MORNING WIND Theres more then music in this early wind Awaking like a bird refreshed from sleep &amp; joy what Adam might in eden find When he with angels did communion keep It breaths all balm &amp; insence from the sky Blessing the husbandman with freshening powers Joys manna from its wings doth fall &amp; lie Harvests for early wakers with the flowers The very grass with joys devotion moves Cowslaps in adoration &amp; delight This way &amp; that bow to the breath they love Of the young winds that with their dewpearls play Till smoaking chimneys sicken the young light &amp; feelings fairey visions fade away HARES AT PLAY The birds are gone to bed the cows are still &amp; sheep lie panting on each old molehill &amp; underneath the willows grey-green bough Like toil a resting—lies the fallow plough The timid hares throw daylight fears away On the lane road to dust &amp; dance &amp; play Then dabble in the grain by nought deterred To lick the dew fall from the barleys beard Then out they sturt again &amp; round the hill Like happy thoughts—dance—squat—&amp; loiter still Till milking maidens in the early morn Gingle their yokes &amp; sturt them in the corn Through well known beaten paths each nimbling hare Sturts quick as fear—&amp; seeks its hidden lair THE FLOOD On Lolham Brigs in wild &amp; lonely mood Ive seen the winter floods their gambols play Through each old arch that trembled while I stood Bent oer its wall to watch the dashing spray As their old stations would be washed away Crash came the ice against the jambs &amp; then A shudder jarred the arches—yet once more It breasted raving waves &amp; stood agen To wait the shock as stubborn as before —White foam brown crested with the russet soil As washed from new ploughed lands—would dart beneath Then round &amp; round a thousand eddies boil On tother side—then pause as if for breath One minute—&amp; ingulphed—like life in death Whose wrecky stains dart on the floods away More swift then shadows in a stormy day Things trail &amp; turn &amp; steady—all in vain The engulphing arches shoot them quickly through The feather dances flutters &amp; again Darts through the deepest dangers still afloat Seeming as faireys whisked it from the view &amp; danced it oer the waves as pleasures boat Light hearted as a merry thought in may— Trays—uptorn bushes—fence demolished rails Loaded with weeds in sluggish motion stray Like water monsters lost each winds &amp; trails Till near the arches—then as in affright It plunges—reels—&amp; shudders out of sight Waves trough—rebound—&amp; fury boil again Like plunging monsters rising underneath Who at the top curl up a shaggy main A moment catching at a surer breath Then plunging headlong down &amp; down—&amp; on Each following boil the shadow of the last &amp; other monsters rise when those are gone Crest their fringed waves—plunge onward &amp; are past —The chill air comes around me ocean blea From bank to bank the water strife is spread Strange birds like snow spots oer the huzzing sea Hang where the wild duck hurried past &amp; fled —On roars the flood—all restless to be free Like trouble wandering to eternity HEDGE SPARROW The tame hedge sparrow in its russet dress Is half a robin for its gentle ways &amp; the bird loving dame can do no less Then throw it out a crumble on cold days In early march it into gardens strays &amp; in the snug clipt box tree green &amp; round It makes a nest of moss &amp; hair &amp; lays When een the snow is lurking on the ground Its eggs in number five of greenish blue Bright beautiful &amp; glossy shining shells Much like the firetails but of brighter hue Yet in her garden home much danger dwells Where skulking cat with mischief in its breast Catches their young before they leave the nest SHEPHERDS HUT The Shepherds hut propt by the double ash Hugh in its bulk &amp; old in mossy age Shadowing the dammed-up brook—where plash &amp; plash The little mills did younkers ears engage Delightful hut rude as romances old Where hugh old stones made each an easy chair &amp; brakes &amp; ferns for luxurys manifold &amp; flint &amp; steel the all want needed there —The light was struck &amp; then the happy ring Crouched round the blaze—O there were happy times Some telling tales &amp; others urged to sing Themes of old things in rude yet feeling ryhmes That raised the laugh or stirred the stifled sigh Till pity listened in each vacant eye Those rude old tales—mans memory augurs ill Thus to forget the fragments of old days Those long old songs—their sweetness haunts me still Nor did they perish for my lack of praise But old desciples of the pasture sward Rude chroniclers of ancient minstrelsy The shepherds vanished all &amp; disregard Left their old music like a vagrant bee For summers breeze to murmur oer &amp; die &amp; in these ancient spots—mind ear &amp; eye Turn listeners—till the very wind prolongs The theme as wishing in its depths of joy To reccolect the music of old songs &amp; meet the hut that blessed me when a boy WOOD PICTURES IN WINTER The woodland swamps with mosses varified &amp; bullrush forrests bowing by the side Of shagroot sallows that snug shelter make For the coy more hen in her bushy lake Into whose tide a little runnel weaves Such charms for silence through the choaking leaves &amp; whimpling melodies that but intrude As lullabys to ancient solitude —The wood-grass plats which last year left behind Weaving their feathery lightness to the wind Look now as picturesque amid the scene As when the summer glossed their stems in green While tasty hare brunts through the creepy gap Seeks their soft beds &amp; squats in safetys lap WOOD PICTURES IN SUMMER The one delicious green that now prevades The woods &amp; fields in endless lights &amp; shades &amp; that deep softness of delicious hues That over head—blends—softens &amp; subdues The eye to extacy &amp; fills the mind With views &amp; visions of enchanting kind While on the velvet down beneath the swail I sit on mossy stump &amp; broken rail Or lean oer crippled gate by hugh old tree Broken by boys disporting there at swee While sunshine spread from an exaustless sky Gives all things extacy as well as I &amp; all wood-swaily places even they Are joys own tennants keeping holiday WOOD PICTURES IN SPRING The rich brown-umber hue the oaks unfold When springs young sunshine bathes their trunks in gold So rich so beautiful so past the power Of words to paint—my heart aches for the dower The pencil gives to soften &amp; infuse This brown luxuriance of unfolding hues This living luscious tinting woodlands give Into a landscape that might breath &amp; live &amp; this old gate that claps against the tree The entrance of springs paradise should be Yet paint itself with living nature fails —The sunshine threading through these broken rails In mellow shades—no pencil eer conveys &amp; mind alone feels fancies &amp; pourtrays A WOODLAND SEAT Within this pleasant wood biside the lane Lets sit &amp; rest us from the burning sun &amp; hide us in the leaves &amp; entertain An hour away—to watch the wood brook run Through heaps of leaves drop dribbling after drop Pining for freedom till it climbs along In eddying fury oer the foamy top &amp; then loud laughing sings its whimpling song Kissing the misty dewberry by its side With eager salutations &amp; in joy Making the flag leaves dance in graceful pride Giving &amp; finding joy—here we employ An hour right profitable thus to see Life may meet joys where few intrusions be &amp; mark the flowers around us how they live Not only for themselves as we may feel But the delight which they to others give For nature never will her gifts consceal From those who love to seek them—here amid These trees how many doth disclose their pride From the unthinking rustic only hid Who never turns him from the road aside To look for beautys which he heedeth not —It gives us greater zest to feel the joys We meet in this sweet solemn suited spot &amp; with high extacys ones mind employs To bear the worst that fickle life prepares Finding her sweets as common as her cares In every trifle somthing lives to please Or to instruct us—every weed or flower Heirs beauty as a birthright by degrees Of more or less though taste alone hath power To see &amp; value what the herd pass bye —This common Dandelion mark how fine Its hue—the shadow of the days proud eye Glows not more rich of gold—that nettle there Trod down by careless rustics every hour Search but its slighted blooms—kings cannot wear Robes prankt with half the splendour of a flower Pencilled with hues of workmanship divine Bestowed to simple things—denied to power &amp; sent to gladden hearts so mean as mine TO MYSTERY Mystery thou subtle essence—ages gain New light from darkness—still thy blanks remain &amp; reason trys [to] chase old night from thee When chaos fled thy parent took the key Blank darkness—&amp; the things age left behind Are lockt for aye in thy unspeaking mind Towers temples ruins on &amp; under ground So old—so dark—so mystic—so profound Old time himself so old is like a child &amp; cant remember when their blocks were piled Or caverns scooped &amp; with a wondering eye He seems to pause like other standers bye Half thinking that the wonders left unknown Was born in ages older than his own THE DINNER IN THE FIELDS How pleasant when athirst in burning days To kneel adown where clear the fountain strays Over its bed of pebbles—oer the brink &amp; just where bubbles blubber up to drink How cooling by the parched lips it runs While some thick willow shadows out the sun &amp; how delicious is the taste—een wine Can[t] relish better where the wealthy dine Then sweet spring water to the thirsty swain Who sits &amp; eats his dinner on the plain &amp; visits with a relish dear to toil The shaded spring where clear the waters boil An ancient luxury where the humble dwell Which Jacob craved from rachel at the well THE MILKING SHED Good God &amp; can it be that such a nook As this can raise such sudden rapture up —Two dotterel trees an oak &amp; ash that stoop Their aged bodys oer a little brook &amp; raise their sheltering heads above &amp; oer A little hovel raised on four old props Old as themselves to look on &amp; what more Nought but an awthorn hedge &amp; yet one stops In admiration &amp; in joy to gaze Upon these objects feeling as I stand That nought in all this wide worlds thorny ways Can match this bit of feelings fairy land How can it be—time owns the potent spell Ive known it from a boy &amp; love it well THE SALLOW Pendant oer rude old ponds or leaning oer The woodlands mossy rails—the sallows now Put on their golden liveries &amp; restore The spring to splendid memories ere a bough Of white thorn shows a leaf to say tis come &amp; through the leafless underwood rich stains Of sunny gold show where the sallows bloom Like sunshine in dark places &amp; gold veins Mapping the russet landscape into smiles At springs approach nor hath the sallow palms A peer for richness—ploughmen in their toils Will crop a branch—smit with its golden charms While at its root the primrose' brunny eye Smiles in his face &amp; blooms deliciously THE HAPPY BIRD The happy whitethroat on the sweeing bough Swayed by the impulse of the gadding wind That ushers in the showers of april—now Singeth right joyously &amp; now reclined Croucheth &amp; clingeth to her moving seat To keep her hold—&amp; till the wind for rest Pauses—she mutters inward melodies That seem her hearts rich thinkings to repeat &amp; when the branch is still—her little breast Swells out in raptures gushing symphonies &amp; then against her brown wing softly prest The wind comes playing an enraptured guest This way &amp; that she swees—till gusts arise More boisterous in their play—&amp; off she flies THE BREATH OF MORNING How beautiful &amp; fresh the pastoral smell Of tedded hay breaths in this early morn Health in these meadows must in summer dwell &amp; take her walks among these fields of corn I cannot see her—yet her voice is born On every breeze that fans my hair about &amp; though the sun is scarcely out of bed Leaning on ground like half awakened sleep The boy hath left his mossy thatched shed &amp; bawling lustily to cows &amp; sheep &amp; taken at the woodbines overhead Climbs up to pluck them from the thorny bower Half drowned by dropples pattering on his head From leaves bemoistened by nights secret shower DECAY Amidst the happiest joy a shade of grief Will come—to mark in summers prime a leaf Tinged with the autumns visible decay As pining to forgetfulness away Aye blank forgetfulness that coldest lot To be—&amp; to have been—&amp; then be not Een beautys self loves essence heavens prime Mate for eternity in joys sublime Earths most divinest is a mortal thing &amp; nurses times sick autumn from its spring &amp; fades &amp; fades till wonder knows it not &amp; admiration hath all praise forgot Coldly forsaking an unheeding past To fade &amp; fall &amp; die like common things at last GLINTON SPIRE Glinton thy taper spire predominates Over the level landscape—&amp; the mind Musing—the pleasing picture contemplates Like elegance of beauty much refined By taste—that almost deifys &amp; elevates Ones admiration making common things Around it glow with beautys not their own Thus all around the earth superior springs Those straggling trees though lonely seem not lone But in thy presence wear superior power &amp; een each mossed &amp; melancholly stone Gleaning cold memories round oblivions bower Seem types of fair eternity—&amp; hire A lease from fame by thy enchanting spire THE MEADOW HAY I often roam a minute from the path Just to luxuriate on the new mown swath &amp; stretch me at my idle length along Hum louder oer some melody or song While passing stranger slackens in his pace &amp; turns to wonder what can haunt the place Unthinking that an idle ryhmster lies Buried in the sweet grass &amp; feeding phantasys This happy spirit of the joyous day Stirs every pulse of life into the play Of buoyant joy &amp; extacy—I walk &amp; hear the very weeds to sing &amp; talk Of their delights as the delighted wind Toys with them like playfellows ever kind BURTHORP OAK Old noted oak I saw thee in a mood Of vague indifference—&amp; yet with me Thy memory like thy fate hath lingering stood Like an old hermit in the lonely sea Of grass that waves around thee—Solitude Paints not a lonlier picture to the view Burthorp then thy one solitary tree Age rent &amp; shattered to a stump—Yet new Leaves come upon each rift &amp; broken limb With every spring—&amp; poesys visions swim Around it of old days &amp; chivalry &amp; desolate fancys bid the eyes grow dim With feelings that earths grandeur should decay &amp; all its olden memories pass away MIDSUMMER Midsummers breath gives ripeness to the year Of beautiful &amp; picturesque &amp; grand Tinting the mountain with the hues of fear Bare climbing dizziness—where bushes stand Their breakneck emminence with danger near Like lives in peril—though they wear a smile Tis sickly green as in a homeless dream Of terror at their fate—while under land Smiles with home hues as rich as health to toil In mellow greens &amp; darker lights that cheer The ploughman turning up the healthy soil &amp; health &amp; pleasure glistens every where —So high ambitions dwell as dangers guests &amp; quiet minds as small birds in their nests OBSCURITY Old tree oblivion doth thy life condemn Blank &amp; recordless as that summer wind That fanned the first few leaves on thy young stem When thou wert one years shoot—&amp; who can find Their homes of rest or paths of wandering now So seems thy history to a thinking mind As now I gaze upon thy sheltering bough Thou grew unnoticed up to flourish now &amp; leave thy past as nothing all behind Where many years &amp; doubtless centurys lie That ewe beneath thy shadow—nay that flie Just settled on a leaf—can know with time Almost as much of thy blank past as I Thus blank oblivion reigns as earths sublime PLEASURES OF FANCY A Path old tree goes bye thee crooking on &amp; through this little gate that claps &amp; bangs Against thy rifted trunk what steps hath gone Though but a lonely way—yet mystery hangs Oer crowds of pastoral scenes recordless here The boy might climb the nest in thy young boughs Thats slept half an eternity—in fear The herdsman may have left his startled cows For shelter when heavens thunder voice was near Here too the woodman on his wallet laid For pillow may have slept an hour away &amp; poet pastoral lover of the shade Here sat &amp; mused half some long summers day While some old shepherd listened to the lay THE TRUTH OF TIME Go vile hypocrisy with subtle tongue &amp; smooth spruce visage that can hide a lie In fairest speech &amp; meditate a wrong Under prayers masking—put that covering bye That hid thy speckled snakes thy whole life long Here truth reigns absolute—nay pass not bye That mask must off—&amp; thy deformity In nakedness of deeds must stand &amp; show The hypocrite that seemed a saint below That like a gamester shuffled so the cards To win by cheating honestys awards Poor honesty that like a carrion crow Was made by thee—aye quake from foot to brow Eternitys thy judge &amp; deaths thy partner now THE FOUNTAIN OF HOPE Truth old as heaven is &amp; God is truth &amp; hope is never old but still a youth &amp; when I ope the volume which began Its essence &amp; its mystery with man I see that divine shadow mystery &amp; all the attributes of majesty The high consception—power unspeakable Where deity as three-almighty dwell &amp; rise above myself oer reasons shrine &amp; feel my origin as love divine Older then earth 'bove worlds however high An essence to be crushed but never die That like a light hereafter shall arise A star or comet in those mighty skies Where God the sun smiles on it like a flower &amp; bids it live in light neath his almighty power EVENING PRIMROSE When once the sun sinks in the west &amp; dewdrops pearl the evenings breast All most as pale as moonbeams are Or its companionable star The evening primrose opes anew Its delicate blossoms to the dew &amp; shunning-hermit of the light Wastes its fair bloom upon the night Who blindfold to its fond caresses Knows not the beauty it posseses Thus it blooms on till night is bye &amp; day looks out with open eye Bashed at the gaze it cannot shun It faints &amp; withers &amp; is done HOME PICTURES IN MAY The sunshine bathes in clouds of many hues &amp; mornings feet are gemed with early dews Warm daffodils about the garden beds Peep through their pale slim leaves their golden heads Sweet earthly suns of spring—the gossling broods In coats of sunny green about the road Waddle in extacy—&amp; in rich moods The old hen leads her flickering chicks abroad Oft scuttling neath her wings to see the kite Hang wavering oer them in the springs blue light The sparrows round their new nests chirp with glee &amp; sweet the robin springs young luxury shares Tutting its song in feathery gooseberry tree While watching worms the gardeners spade unbears SUDDEN SHOWER Black grows the southern sky betokening rain &amp; humming hive bees homeward hurry bye They feel the change—so let us shun the grain &amp; take the broad road while our feet are dry Aye there some dropples moistened in my face &amp; pattered on my hat—tis coming nigh Lets about &amp; find a sheltering place The little things around like you &amp; I Are hurrying through the grass to shun the shower Here stoops an ash tree—hark the wind gets high But never mind this Ivy for an hour Rain as it may will keep us dryly here That little wren knows well his sheltering bower Nor leaves his dry house though we come so near CARLESS RAMBLES I love to wander at my idle will In summers luscious prime about the fields &amp; kneel when thirsty at the little rill To sip the draught its pebbly bottom yields &amp; where the maple bush its fountain shields To lie &amp; rest a swaily hour away &amp; crop the swelling peascod from the land Or mid the upland woodland walks to stray Where oaks for aye oer their old shadows stand Neath whose dark foliage with a welcome hand I pluck the luscious strawberry ripe &amp; red As beautys lips—&amp; in my fancys dreams As mid the velvet moss I musing tread Feel life as lovely as her picture seems LOVE IN YOUTH Words paint not womans beauty springs young hour Grow flowers to paint her she herselfs a flower Fairer then aught but blossoms &amp; they bear But faint remembrance to a thing so fair The red rose in her cheeks doth blushing lie Lit up like sunshine by her laughing eye &amp; the white lilys on her beating breast Spread warm &amp; nuzzling like two doves at rest Her lips are two twin roseys which the morn Kisses &amp; leaves its dewy pearls thereon Smiles hang about them as if loath to give Room to those frowns that bade hope cease to live &amp; joy in all youths motions seem to say Beauty &amp; youth here make their holiday Thou page of [living] beauty can the eye Find aught so rich as natures works supply With some the person—some the mind adds grace Though rosey cheeks ill suits an harlots face —Thine is the beauty such as all esteems With heart as innoscent as infants dreams Pure as the virgin flower untouched &amp; free From the bold freedom of the amorous bee Thy voice was rich as fame thy praise een now Comes like the glory round an angels brow For fame is nothing worth the muses care Unless to grace it womans love be there &amp; praise is but a shadow cloathed in bays Without the honey dew of beautys praise THE OLD WILLOW The juicey wheat now spindles into ear &amp; trailing pea blooms ope their velvet eyes &amp; weeds &amp; flowers by crowds far off &amp; near In all their sunny liveries appear For summers lustre boasts unnumbered dyes How pleasant neath this willow by the brook Thats kept its ancient place for many a year To sit &amp; oer these crowded fields to look &amp; the soft dropping of the shower to hear Ourselves so sheltered een a pleasant book Might lie uninjured from the fragrant rain For not a drop gets through the bowering leaves But dry as housed in my old hut again I sit &amp; troubleous care of half its claim decieve AMBITION Ambition what a pomp creating word Tis libelous of comfort though tis heard As comforts aid &amp; counsellor—O fie That hearts should smile at what should make them sigh The swelling thought that gives the heart relief The ever craving wish that will not sleep Till comes the sudden gush of care &amp; grief &amp; anxious hope that gives it small relief Soothing the rude extremeties of fate Till every hope hath left it desolate Like grandeur that with fading pride doth dwell Oer ancient walls till every stone hath fell It falls &amp; leaves—the song of every wind A broken shadow of its hopes behind THE WRYNECKS NEST That summer bird its oft repeated note Chirps from the dotterel ash &amp; in the hole The green woodpecker made in years remote It makes its nest—where peeping idlers strole In anxious plundering moods—&amp; bye &amp; bye The wrynecks curious eggs as white as snow While squinting in the hollow tree they spy The sitting bird looks up with jetty eye &amp; waves her head in terror too &amp; fro Speckled &amp; veined in various shades of brown &amp; then a hissing noise assails the clown &amp; quick with hasty terror in his breast From the trees knotty trunk he sluthers down &amp; thinks the strange bird guards a serpents nest PROVIDENCE Folks talk of providence with heedless tongue That leads to riches &amp; not happiness Which is but a new tune for fortunes song &amp; one contentment cares not to possess It knows her seldom &amp; it shuns her long &amp; that kind providence least understood Hath been my friend that helps me bear with wrong &amp; learns me out of evil to find good To hearten up against the heartless deeds Of faithless friends who led me blindly on To make my poor faith wither mid the weeds Of their deceptions—yet when all were gone A voice within told me of one true friend &amp; this is providence right worthy to commend It hides the future &amp; leaves room for hope To smile—&amp; promise joys that may not come &amp; cares from which our fortunes cant elope Are robbed of half their terrors being dumb &amp; all unable to foretell their speed This blessed ignorance is half the sum Of providence—thus all are blest indeed The weak &amp; strong the timid &amp; the bold Thus will the hare feel safe in its retreat Where lay the murdering wolf an hour before &amp; upon boughs warm with the eagles feet The wren will perch &amp; dream of harm no more Kind providence amid contending strife Bids weakness feel the liberty of life THE WHEAT RIPENING What time the wheat field tinges rusty brown &amp; barley bleaches in its mellow grey Tis sweet some smooth mown baulk to wander down Or cross the fields on footpaths narrow way Just in the mealy light of waking day As glittering dewdrops moise the maidens gown &amp; sparkling bounces from her nimble feet Journeying to milking from the neighbouring town Making life light with song—&amp; it is sweet To mark the grazing herds &amp; list the clown Urge on his ploughing team with cheering calls &amp; merry shepherds whistling toils begun &amp; hoarse tongued birdboy whose unceasing calls Join the larks ditty to the rising sun THE HAPPINESS OF IGNORANCE Ere I had known the world &amp; understood How many follies wisdom names its own Distinguishing things evil from things good The dread of sin &amp; death—ere I had known Knowledge the root of evil—had I been Left in some lone place where the world is wild &amp; trace of troubling man was never seen Brought up by nature as her favourite child As born for nought but joy where all rejoice Emparadised in ignorance of sin Where nature tries with never chiding voice Like tender nurse nought but our smiles to win The future dreamless beautiful would be The present—foretaste of eternity TO CHARLES LAMB ON HIS ESSAYS Elia thy reveries &amp; visioned themes To cares lorn heart a luscious pleasure proves Wild as the mystery of delightful dreams Soft as the anguish of remembered love Like records of past days their memory dances Mid the cool feelings manhoods reason brings As the unearthly visions of romances Peopled with sweet &amp; uncreated things &amp; yet thy themes thy gentle worth enhances Then wake again thy wild harps tenderest strings Sing on sweet bard let fairy loves again Smile in thy dreams with angel extacies Bright oer our soul will break the heavenly strain Through the dull gloom of earths realities FORREST FLOWERS Ye simple weeds that make the desert gay Disdained of all een by the youngsters eye Who lifts his stick a weapon in his play &amp; lops your blossoms as he saunters bye In mockery of merriment—yet I Hail you as favourites of my early days &amp; every year as mid your haunts I lie Some added pleasure claims my lonely gaze Starpointed thistle with its ruddy flowers Wind waving rush left to bewildered ways Shunning the scene which cultures toil devours Ye thrive in silence where I glad recline Sharing with finer blooms springs gentle showers That shows ye're prized by better taste then mine THE ASS Poor patient creature how I grieve to see Thy wants so ill supplied—to see thee strain &amp; stretch thy tether for the grass in vain Which heavens rain waters for all else but thee The fair green field the fullnes of the plain Add to thy hunger colt &amp; heifer pass &amp; roll as though they mocked thee on the grass Which would be luxury to the bare brown lane Where thourt imprisoned humble patient ass Cropping foul weeds &amp; scorning to complain Mercey at first “sent out the wild ass free” A ranger “of the mountains” &amp; what crimes Did thy progenitors that thou shouldst be The slave &amp; mockery of latter times SUNRISE Morning awakes sublime—glad earth &amp; sky Smile in the splendour of the day begun Oer the broad easts illumined canopy Shade of its makers majesty the sun Gleams in its living light—from cloud to cloud Streaks of all colours beautifully run As if before heavens gate there hung a shroud To hide its grand magnificence—O heaven Where entrance een to thought is disallowed To view the glory that this scene is giving What may blind reason not expect to see When in immortal worlds the soul is living Eternal as its maker &amp; as free To taste the unknowns of eternity SUNSET Welcome sweet eve thy gently sloping sky &amp; softly whispering wind that breaths of rest &amp; clouds unlike what daylight galloped bye Now stopt as weary huddling in the west Each by the farewell of days closing eye Left with the smiles of heaven on its breast Meek nurse of weariness how sweet to meet Thy soothing tenderness to none denied To hear thy whispering voice—ah heavenly sweet Musing &amp; listening by thy gentle side Lost to lifes cares thy coloured skies to view Picturing of pleasant worlds unknown to care &amp; when our bark the rough sea flounders through Warming in hopes its end shall harbour there NOTHINGNESS OF LIFE I never pass a venerable tree Pining away to nothingness &amp; dust Ruins vain shades of power I never see Once dedicated to times cheating trust But warm reflection wakes her saddest thought &amp; views lifes vanity in cheerless light &amp; sees earths bubbles youth so eager sought Burst into emptiness of lost delight &amp; all the pictures of lifes early day Like evenings striding shadows haste away Yet theres a glimmering of pleasure springs From such reflections of earths vanity That pines &amp; sickens oer lifes mortal things &amp; leaves a relish for eternity THE INSTINCT OF HOPE Is there another world for this frail dust To warm with life &amp; be itself again Somthing about me daily speaks there must &amp; why should instinct nourish hopes in vain Tis natures prophecy that such will be &amp; every thing seems struggling to explain The close sealed volume of its mystery Time wandering onward keeps its usual pace As seeming anxious of eternity To meet that calm &amp; find a resting place Een the small violet feels a future power &amp; waits each year renewing blooms to bring &amp; surely man is no inferior flower To die unworthy of a second spring ROUND OAK SPRING Sweet brook Ive met thee many a summers day &amp; ventured fearless in thy shallow flood &amp; rambled oft thy sweet unwearied way Neath willows cool that on thy margin stood With crowds of partners in my artless play Grasshopper beetle bee &amp; butterflye That frisked about as though in merry mood To see their old companion sporting bye Sweet brook lifes glories once were thine &amp; mine Shades cloathed thy spring that now doth naked lie On thy white boiling sand the sweet woodbine Darkened &amp; dipt its flowers—I mark &amp; sigh &amp; muse oer troubles since we met the last Like two fond friends whose happiness is past THE MAJIC OF BEAUTY An imperfection as perfections guest Is greatest beauty—charms immaculate &amp; tawny moles upon a womans breast Grow very jewels in their fair estate So is it where the hearts consceptions wait On beauty as her lacquey—up we climb &amp; from the very sun oer heavens own gate Snatch a rich jewel—gracing common time Making earth heaven—in our fancys dreams &amp; woman as an idol in esteem Fairest companion of fair thoughts—&amp; kin To graces perfectness in heavens own grace To worship such therefore can be no sin If heavens own copy lives in beautys face THE HEDGE ROSE The wild rose swells its prickly buds anew &amp; soon shall wear the summers witching hue Those hues which nature as its dowery heirs &amp; beauty like a blossom wins &amp; wears On her soft cheeks when shepherds in the grove Reach down the blushing flowers &amp; talk of love The very bees that such intrusions scare Frit from the blossom that he culls her there Flye round mistaken as they leave the bower &amp; take the maids sweet blushes for a flower Thus wild dog roseys hung in every hedge Wakens at joys hearts core its sweetest pledge Shedding to summer lanes their rich perfume &amp; whispering memorys raptures while they bloom THE FEAR OF FLOWERS The nodding oxeye bends before the wind The woodbine quakes lest boys their flowers should find &amp; prickly dog rose spite of its array Can't dare the blossom seeking hand away While thistles wear their heavy knobs of bloom Proud as the war horse wears its haughty plume &amp; by the road side dangers self defies On commons where pined sheep &amp; oxen lie In ruddy pomp &amp; ever thronging mood It stands &amp; spreads like danger in a wood &amp; in the village street where meanest weeds Can't stand untouched to fill their husks with seed The haughty thistle oer all danger towers In every place the very whasp of flowers THE HEAT OF NOON There lies a sultry lusciousness around The far stretched pomp of summer which the eye Views with a dazzled gaze—&amp; gladly bounds Its prospects to some pastoral spots that lie Nestling among the hedge confining grounds Where in some nook the haystacks newly made Scents the smooth level meadow land around While underneath the woodlands hazley hedge The crowding oxen make their swaily beds &amp; in the dry dyke thronged with rush &amp; sedge The restless sheep rush in to hide their heads From the unlost &amp; ever haunting flie &amp; under every trees projecting shade Places as battered as the road is made EMMONSAILS HEATH IN WINTER I love to see the old heaths withered brake Mingle its crimpled leaves with furze &amp; ling While the old Heron from the lonely lake Starts slow &amp; flaps his melancholly wing &amp; oddling crow in idle motions swing On the half rotten ash trees topmost twig Beside whose trunk the gipsey makes his bed Up flies the bouncing woodcock from the brig Where a black quagmire quakes beneath the tread The fieldfare chatters in the whistling thorn &amp; for the awe round fields &amp; closen rove &amp; coy bumbarrels twenty in a drove Flit down the hedgrows in the frozen plain &amp; hang on little twigs &amp; start again THE FIRETAILS NEST Tweet pipes the Robin as the cat creeps bye Her nestling young that in the elderns lie &amp; then the Bluecap tootles in its glee Picking the flies from orchard apple tree &amp; Pink the Chaffinch cries its well known strain Urging its kind to utter pink again While in a quiet mood hedge sparrows trie An inward stir of shadowed melody —Around the rotten tree the firetail mourns As the old hedger to his toil returns Chopping the grain to stop the gap close bye The hole where her blue eggs in safety lie Of every thing that stirs she dreameth wrong &amp; pipes her “tweet tut” fears the whole day long MONARCHY OF NATURE Ive often thought me that a king should be The head of every empire when Ive seen The little toilings of the honey bee Who forms a colony &amp; owns a queen &amp; hurds his stores for winter in his hive While wild &amp; straggling tribes in bank &amp; wall Bore little holes—nor further store contrive Then what themselves may want—&amp; may be all May be consumed ere winters storms are past &amp; then with famines tribes they pine &amp; die While tempest proof against the rudest blast The hive bees monarchy doth live &amp; thrive Like populous citys &amp; when winters bye Crowds upon crowds again their busy labours ply BLAKE Blake though insulted by a kings decree Thy fame stirs onward like the mighty sea That throws its painted gems upon the shore To deck crowns heirs with glitter little more While all thats truly noble &amp; sublime Is rolling onward to the throne of time Time the insulted arbiter of fame Merits reward &amp; tyrants lasting shame That rusts crowns into baubles—kings to dust Then Blake thy glory kindled in its trust &amp; like the sea thy hearts own element Shining in light &amp; earths amaze it went Pursuing on a worth ennobled way Heroe-inspiring theme of glorys dauntless day THE WRYNECKS NEST Yon summer bird its oft repeated note Chirps from that dotterel ash &amp; in the hole The green woodpecker made in years remote It makes its nest where idle birdboys stroll In anxious robbing moods—&amp; bye &amp; bye The wrynecks curious eggs all white as snow While peeping in the hollow tree they spy The sitting bird looks up with jetty eye &amp; waves her head in terror too &amp; fro Snake-speckled in the varied shades of brown &amp; then a hissing noise the startled clown Heereth &amp; bursting terror throbs his breast Quick from the knotty trunk he sluthers down Thinking the strange bird guards a serpents nest MERIT Hard words to vague pretention seres like death &amp; kills its feeble efforts with a breath But insults thrown on merits struggling way Are help-mates to her journey—not decay As fires lies smouldering till the wind sweeps past Then bursts to flame &amp; kindles with the blast So from the throws of envy hate &amp; strife Genius bursts forth &amp; breaths eternal life In vain the taunt would blight the scoff would sere Like cobweb network falls the gibe &amp; sneer &amp; genius like a sunburst from the cloud Throws forth her light her mind is heard aloud The nights of malice into lights decay &amp; aids her exaltations into day ASHTON LAWN I had a joy &amp; keep it still alive Of hoarding in the memorys treasured book Old favourite spots that with affections thrive &amp; to my inward fancys shine &amp; look Like well-done pictures in some winning page Such was old Langley bush by time forsook With its old sheltered thorn tree mossed with age &amp; such the roman bank by swordy well Where idless would a leisure hour engage To hunt where ditchers toild the pooty shell Among the sand &amp; grit existing still Though buried with it sixteen hundred years Thus man in myriads dies—while time reveres The simplest things above his mightiest skill In Ashton lawn condemned to slow decay Close to the south-east nook a ruined hill Lies choaked in thorns &amp; briars—yet to this day Reality may trace the castle still A fragment of the moat still forms a pond Beset with hoof tracked paths of horse &amp; cow That often go to drink &amp; all beyond Greensward with little molehills on its brow &amp; fairy-rings in its old mysterys dark Still wear its ancient name &amp; shepherds call The closen all around it still “old parks” Still traced by buried fragments of a wall The castles self will soon be nothings heir Pickt up to mend old roads—old garden walls repair GREENSWARD Rich healthiness bedyes the summer grass Of each old close—&amp; everywhere instills Gladness to travellers while they pause &amp; pass The narrow pathway through the old molehills Of glad neglected pastures—&amp; Ive thought While sitting down upon their quiet laps That no delights that rich men ever bought Could equal mine—where quiet came unsought While the cow mused beside the broken gaps At the rich hay close sweeping to the wind &amp; as to pleasure natures gifts not few Comes to the heart as unto grass the dew For e'en her meanest gifts where e'er we find Are worth a praise as music to the mind THE MOLE Rude architect rich instincts natural taste Is thine by heritage—thy little mounds Bedecking furze clad heath &amp; rushy waste Betraced with sheeptracks shine like pleasure grounds No rude inellegance thy work confounds But scenes of picturesque &amp; beautiful Lye mid thy little hills of cushioned thyme On which the cowboy when his hands are full Of wild flowers leans upon his arm at rest As though his seat were feathers—when I climb Thy little fragrant mounds I feel thy guest &amp; hail neglect thy patron who contrives Waste spots for the[e] on natures quiet breast &amp; taste loves best where thy still labour thrives FIRST SIGHT OF SPRING The hazel blooms in threads of crimson hue Peep through the swelling buds &amp; look for spring Ere yet a white thorn leaf appears in view Or march finds throstles pleased enough to sing On the old touchwood tree woodpeckers cling A moment &amp; their harsh toned notes renew In happier mood the stockdove claps his wing The squirrel sputters up the powdered oak With tail cocked oer his head &amp; ears errect Startled to hear the woodmans understroke &amp; with the courage that his fears collect He hisses fierce half malice &amp; half glee Leaping from branch to branch about the tree In winters foliage moss &amp; lickens drest COTTAGE FEARS The evening gathers from the gloomy woods &amp; darkling creeps oer silent vale &amp; hill While the snug village in nights happy moods Is resting calm &amp; beautifully still The windows gleam with light the yelping curs That guards the henroost from the thieving fox Barks now &amp; then as somthing passing stirs &amp; distant dogs the noises often mocks While foxes from the woods send dismal cries Like somthing in distress the cottager Hears the dread noise &amp; thinks of danger nigh &amp; locks up door in haste—nor cares to stir From the snug safety of his humble shed Then tells strange tales till time to go to bed COLOURS OF AUTUMN Now that the year is drawing to a close Such mellow tints on trees &amp; bushes lie So like to sunshine that it brighter glows As one looks more intently—on the sky I turn astonished that no sun is there The ribboned strips of orange blue &amp; red Streaks through the western sky a georgeous bed Painting days end most beautifully fair So mild so quiet breaths the balmy air Scenting the perfume of decaying leaves Such fragrance &amp; such lovliness they wear Trees hedgrows bushes that the heart recieves Joys for which language owneth words too few To paint that glowing richness which I view THE HOLLOW TREE How oft a summer shower hath started me To seek for shelter in an hollow tree Old hugh ash dotterel wasted to a shell Whose vigorous head still grew &amp; flourished well Where ten might sit upon the battered floor &amp; still look round discovering room for more &amp; he who chose a hermit life to share Might have a door &amp; make a cabin there They seemed so like a house that our desires Would call them so &amp; make our gipsey fires &amp; eat field dinners of the juicey peas Till we were wet &amp; drabbled to the knees But in our old tree house rain as it might Not one drop fell although it rained till night PLEASANT SPOTS There is a wild &amp; beautiful neglect About the fields that so delights &amp; cheers Where nature her own feelings to effect I[s] left at her own silent work for years The simplest thing thrown in our way delights From the wild careless feature that it wears The very road that wanders out of sight Crooked &amp; free is pleasant to behold &amp; such the very weeds left free to flower Corn poppys red &amp; carlock gleaming gold That make the cornfield shine in summers hour Like painted skys—&amp; fancys distant eye May well imagine armys marching bye In all the grand array of pomp &amp; power THE FERN OWLS NEST The weary woodman rocking home beneath His tightly banded faggot wonders oft While crossing over the furze crowded heath To hear the fern owls cry that whews aloft In circling whirls &amp; often by his head Wizzes as quick as thought &amp; ill at rest As through the rustling ling with heavy tread He goes nor heeds he tramples near its nest That underneath the furze or squatting thorn Lies hidden on the ground &amp; teazing round That lonely spot she wakes her jarring noise To the unheeding waste till mottled morn Fills the red east with daylights coming sounds &amp; the heaths echoes mocks the herding boys HAPPY THOUGHTS As pleasant as unlooked for summer showers Where woods &amp; fields lay gaping day by day As a sweet reccompence of sunny hours When oppressed sky imprisoned lay In one thick cloud for days—in these sweet moods I feel within me bidding once again My spirits stir at liberty &amp; play With happy thoughts that ramble far away Along the waggon rifted lanes &amp; woods That give bold outline to the level plain Where old embowering oaks lift overhead An arch of bowering grains—&amp; then to lye On the brown heath where sheep are scantly fed &amp; view the smiles of an unbounded sky Aye theres a wholsome feeling out of doors That nourishes the heart with happy themes The very cattle on the flaggy moors To the minds eye a pleasant picture seems &amp; occupations of home husbandry Some with the plough some singing by the side Of the slow waggon—&amp; when these I see They give such blameless pictures void of strife Such sweet employments neath a smiling sky I even feel that better lot of life That in such spots calm providence is bye &amp; sweet domestic peace whose quiet eye Feels most delight in its own humble home &amp; checks the restless mood that often longs to roam MEADOW PATHS The meadow with its sweep of level green Goes winding onward from admiring eyes Strangers can't say there winter floods have been So vivid &amp; so beautiful it lies Its rich grass fanning to the young soft winds While clumps of early daisys ope their eyes &amp; please the passenger that often winds The little paths that cross it here &amp; there Winding to market village feast or fair &amp; more then happy doth the schoolboy go With little basket swinging at his side Tracing their verdant carpets too &amp; fro Morning &amp; night with leisure gratified While earth with Gods rich blessings overflow STRAY WALKS How pleasant are the fields to roam &amp; think Whole sabbaths through unnoticed &amp; alone Beside the little molehill skirted brink Of the small brook that skips oer many a stone Or green woodside where many a squatting oak Far oer grass screeds their white stained branches hing Forming in pleasant close a happy seat To nestle in while small birds chirp &amp; sing &amp; the loud blackbird will its mate provoke More louder yet its chorus to repeat How pleasant is it thus to think &amp; roam The many paths scarce knowing which to chuse All full of pleasant scenes—then wander home &amp; oer the beautys we have met to muse Tis sunday &amp; the little paths that wind Through closen green by hedges &amp; wood sides &amp; like a brook corn crowded slope divides Of pleasant fields—their frequent passers find From early morn to mellow close of day On different errands climbing many stiles Oer hung with awthorn tempting haste to stay &amp; cool some moments of the road away When hot &amp; high the uncheckt summer smiles Some journeying to the little hamlet hid In dark surrounding trees to see their friends While some sweet leisures aimless road pursue Wherever fancys musing pleasure wends To woods or lakes or church thats never out of view PASTORAL LIBERTY O for the unshackled mood as free as air &amp; pleasure wild as birds upon the wing The unwronged impulse won from seasons fair Like birds perrenial travels with the spring Come peace &amp; joy the unworn path to trace Crossing ling-heaths &amp; hazel crowded glen Where health salutes me with its ruddy face &amp; joy breaths freely from the strife of men O lead me any where but in the crowd On some lone island rather would I be Than in the world worn knowledge noising loud Wealth gathering up &amp; loosing—leave with me Calm joy &amp; humble hope from quiet won To live in peace unhurt &amp; hurting none EARLY IMAGES Come early morning with thy mealy grey Moist grass &amp; fitful gales that winnow soft &amp; frequent—I'll be up with early day &amp; roam the social way where passing oft The milking maid who greets the pleasant morn &amp; shepherd with his hook in folded arm Rocking along accross the bending corn &amp; hear the many sounds from distant farm Of cackling hens &amp; turkeys gobbling loud &amp; teams just plodding on their way to plough Down russet tracks that strip the closen green &amp; hear the mellow low of distant cow &amp; see the mist upcreeping like a cloud From hollow places in the early scene &amp; mark the jerking swallow jerk &amp; fling Its flight oer new mown meadows happily &amp; cuckoo quivering upon narrow wing Take sudden flitting from the neighbouring tree &amp; heron stalking solitary thing Mount up into high travel far away &amp; that mild indecision hanging round Skys holding bland communion with the ground In gentlest pictures of the infant day Now picturing rain—while many a pleasing sound Grows mellower distant in the mealy grey Of dewy pastures &amp; full many a sight Seems sweeter in its indistinct array Than when it glows in mornings stronger light THE MILKMAIDS SONG Hark to that beautiful melody it is The milkmaid singing love songs to her cow With a voice like nightingales—list who would miss Such music for a little lack of sleep By rising an hour or two before The common day gets marred by vulgar sounds The air is pleasant too &amp; giveth store Of health that early risers purchase cheap This singing milkmaid seeks this happy place Early &amp; late her morn &amp; evening rounds The passer bye neer meets a sweeter face With ready smiles to greet the pleasant day How doth such greetings happy thoughts surround Cheating a pleasant walk of half the way THE CLUMP OF FERN Pleasures lie scattered all about our ways Harvest for thought &amp; joy to look &amp; glean Much of the beautiful to win our praise Lie where we never heeded aught had been By this wood stile half buried in the shade Of rude disorder—bramble woodbine all So thickly wove that nutters scarcely made An entrance through—&amp; now the acorns fall The gatherers seeking entrance pause awhile Ere they mount up the bank to climb the stile Half wishing that a better road was nigh Yet here mid leaf strewn mornings autumn mild While pleasing sounds &amp; pleasing sights are bye Things beautiful delight my heart to smile Here underneath the stiles moss covered post A little bunch of fern doth thrive &amp; spring Hid from the noisey wind &amp; coming frost Like late reared young neath the wood piegons wing Ive seen beneath the furze bush clumps of ling So beautiful in pinky knotts of bloom That made the inmost hearts emotions breath A favourite love for the unsocial heath That gives man no inviting hopes to come To fix his dwelling &amp; disturb the scene So in my lonliness of mood this green Large clump of crimpled fern leaves doth bequeath Like feelings—&amp; wherever wanderers roam Some little scraps of happiness is seen A AUTUMN MORNING The autumn morning waked by many a gun Throws oer the fields her many coloured light Wood wildly touched close tanned &amp; stubbles dun A motley paradise for earths delight Clouds ripple as the darkness breaks to light &amp; clover fields are hid with silver mist One shower of cobwebs oer the surface spread &amp; threads of silk in strange disorder twist Round every leaf &amp; blossoms bottly head Hares in the drowning herbage scarcely steal But on the battered pathway squats a bed &amp; by the cart rut nips her morning meal Look where we may the scene is strange &amp; new &amp; every object wears a changing hue FORREST TREES The woods how lovely with their crowds of trees Each towering over each like hills oer hills The oaks excess for darkest covert made The mind with a sublime of pleasure fills Then winged ash more sparingly displayed A lightness oer the pensive eye distills &amp; elms in hanging branches mass oer mass Determined still the woods to overlook &amp; willows feigning fondness for the grass That leans oer pastoral pond &amp; little brook Like gipseys smoak beside the wood displays Its lonely patch of green inclining greys While the white poplar in the hedge so tall Like leafy steeples overtops them all A AWTHORN NOOK The smooth &amp; velvet sward my fancy suits In pleasant places where the awthorns look As left for arbours &amp; the old tree roots Lie crampt &amp; netted oer the guggling brook &amp; shepherd on his elbow lolls to read His slips of ballads bought at neighbouring fair Seeming unconsious of the beautys there The stilly quiet of the grassy screed Skirting the busy brook—the happy fare Of little birds that in the bushes breed Are all unnoticed save that carless way That sees &amp; feels not—there I love to pass The green hours leisure of a summers day Stretching at length upon the couching grass SAND MARTIN Thou hermit haunter of the lonely glen &amp; common wild &amp; heath—the desolate face Of rude waste landscapes far away from men Where frequent quarrys give thee dwelling place With strangest taste &amp; labour undeterred Drilling small holes along the quarrys side More like the haunts of vermin than a bird &amp; seldom by the nesting boy descried Ive seen thee far away from all thy tribe Flirting about the unfrequented sky &amp; felt a feeling that I can't describe Of lone seclusion &amp; a hermit joy To see thee circle round nor go beyond That lone heath &amp; its melancholly pond TWILIGHT IN SUMMER Such splendid pomp the summers richness brings That sunset far beyond her journey flings Illuminating streaks of golden stain &amp; where the dial looks for smiles in vain Oer the cold bosom of the gloomy north Streaks of her smiling bounty issue forth So bright as if the sun made longer stay &amp; sought for heaven by that lonely way As if to leave no part of earth or sky Without his smile to glad the gazing eye So providence in every place appears To chace the gloom that struggles into fears &amp; leaves a smile from summer every where The lone to cherish &amp; the sad to cheer FIELD THOUGHTS Field thoughts to me are happiness &amp; joy Where I can lye upon the pleasant grass Or track some little path &amp; so employ My mind in trifles pausing as I pass The little wild flower clumps by nothing nurst But dews &amp; sunshine &amp; impartial rain &amp; welcomly to quench my summer thirst I bend me by the flaggy dyke to gain Dewberrys so delicious to the taste &amp; then I wind the flag fringed meadow lake &amp; mark the pike plunge with unusual haste Through water weeds &amp; many a circle make While bursts of happiness from heaven fall There all have hopes here fields are free for all A WALK Being refreshed with thoughts of wandering moods I took my staff &amp; wandered far away Through swampy fenland void of heaths &amp; woods To see if summers luxury could display In such drear places aught of beautiful &amp; sooth it gives me much delight to say That painters would feel exquisite to cull Rich bits of landscape I have seen to day Down by the meadow side our journey lay Along a sloping bank profusely spread With yarrow ragwort flea bane all in flower As showy almost as a garden bed But thistles like unbidden guests would come &amp; throw a dreary prospect in the way Then oer some arches intersecting walls We clambered &amp; pursued the dreary fen Upon whose dreary edge old Waldron hall Stood like a lone place far removed from men Hid under willows tall as forrest trees Yet there we met with places rich to please Green closen osier clumps &amp; black topt reeds In little forrests shooting crowds on crowds So thickly set no opening scarce alowed The bird a passage in their shade to breed &amp; now a fishers hut—I could but look In lone seclusion in my journey lay Placed on a knoll of that wild reedy nook As if some Crusoe had been cast away In that rude desolate flat when winter floods Rave seas of danger round its little bay So thought I in supprises startled moods To meet that little picture in my way Then swept the brown bank in a rounding way &amp; flag clumps vivid green &amp; little woods Of osiers made the wilderness be gay &amp; some green closen so intensly green I could have wasted half a summers day To gaze upon their beauty so serene As if calm peace had made its dwelling there For in such places she hath often been An unhoused dweller in the open air An hermit giving blessings to the scene Now came the river sweeping round the nooks By thirsty summers pilgrimage subdued Dark &amp; yet clear the glassy water looks As slow &amp; easy in majestic mood It sweeps along by osier crowded glen Untill it winds an almost naked flood Along the flats of the unwooded fen Yet even there prolific summer dwells &amp; garnishes its sides in vivid green Of flags &amp; reeds the otters pathless den —Now lanes without a guide post plainly tells Their homward paths—while from a stile is seen The open church tower &amp; its little bells &amp; chimneys low where peaceful quiet dwells My journey feels refreshed with green delight Though woods nor heaths nor molehill pastures led A pleasant varied way—yet richly spread Corn crowded grounds in awthorn hedges dight That shelter gave to many a little bird Where yellowhammers “peeped” in saddened plight At peeping cowboy that its pleasure marred Who carried in his hat its stubbly nest &amp; sung in rapture oer his stolen prize The eggs in his rude mind where strangely guest As written on by some strange phantasys Strange prodigys that happy summer brings To minds as happy &amp; my journey tells My mind that joy in poor seclusion dwells SUMMER HAPPINESS The sun looks down in such a mellow light I cannot help but ponder in delight To see the meadows so divinely lye Beneath the quiet of the evening sky The flags &amp; rush in lights &amp; shades of green Look far more rich than I have ever seen &amp; bunches of white clover bloom again &amp; plats of lambtoe still in flower remain In the brown grass that summer scythes have shorn In every meadow level as a lawn While peace &amp; quiet in that silent mood Cheers my lone heart &amp; doth my spirits good The level grass the sun the mottled sky Seems waiting round to welcome passers bye Summer is prodigal of joy the grass Swarms with delighted insects as I pass &amp; crowds of grasshoppers at every stride Jump out all ways with happiness their guide &amp; from my brushing feet moths flirt away In safer places to pursue their play In crowds they start I marvel well I may To see such worlds of insects in the way &amp; more to see each thing however small Sharing joys bounty that belongs to all &amp; here I gather by the world forgot Harvests of comfort from their happy mood Feeling Gods blessing dwells in every spot &amp; nothing lives but ows him gratitude THE WELLAND Theres somthing quite refreshing to behold A broad &amp; winding river wirl away Here waterlilys studding nooks with gold There yielding rushes bowing gentle sway &amp; trailing weeds whose easy curves delay The waters for a moment—till they pass &amp; in a stiller motion sweep &amp; bend A broad &amp; liquid mirror smooth as glass In whose clear bosom are distinctly penned Trees flowers &amp; weeds in a delightful mass Like happy thoughts in quiets easy mood Oer which the fisher prows his boat along &amp; welland on thy reedy banks I find Calm musings too I'm fain to cherish long MOWERS DINNER HOUR Upon the shady sward in meadow nook Where spreads a tree to keep the waters cool As sweet as pictures in a pleasant book The mowers sit at dinner by the pool Healthy &amp; stubborn as their hard employ Oercanopied in boughs &amp; pleasant shade Theirs is the envied seat of real joy &amp; luxury never sweeter dinner made Than they of humbler means on the rich grass With home brewed ale held up to merry lass Who laughing comes to turn the bleaching hay Ah did they know how happily they pass Their time in toil they'd never wish for wealth But keep their low estate &amp; so ensure their health COTTAGE COMFORT The moon looks through the window late at eve &amp; throws the patterns of the diamond panes Upon the cottage floor—while fancys leave Illustrious calmness round—such as were vain To look or search for in a higher state Where calm contentment seldom wait on gain Who far too throng to sit &amp; contemplate Her quiet lonliness—drives after wealth With all the worlds anxiety &amp; bent Not taking heed for happiness or health For they by humbler paths their journey went Well be the hermits wish my nourishment Some quiet nook that leaves the crowd by stealth Peace from the world a cottage &amp; content FOOTPATHS Theres somthing rich &amp; joyful to the mind To view through close &amp; field those crooked shreds Of footpaths that most picturesqly wind From town to town or some tree hidden sheds Where lonely cottager lifes peace enjoys Far far from strife &amp; all its troubled noise The pent up artizan by pleasure led Along their winding ways right glad employs His sabbath leisure in the freshening air The grass the trees the sunny sloping sky From his weeks prison gives delicious fare But still he passes almost vacant bye The many charms that poesy finds to please Along the little footpaths such as these Now tracking fields where passenger appears As wading to his waist in crowding grain Where ever as we pass the bending ears Pat at our sides &amp; gain their place again Then crooked stile with little steps that aids The climbing meets us—&amp; the pleasant grass &amp; hedgrows old with arbours ready made For weariness to rest in pleasant shades Surround us &amp; with extacy we pass Wild flowers &amp; insect tribes that ever mate With joy &amp; dance from every step we take In numberless confusion—all employ Their little aims for peace &amp; pleasures sake &amp; every summers footpath leads to joy Now sudden as a pleasure unawares A wooden plank strides oer a little brook That unto thirst the sweetest boon prepares Paved oer with pebbles to the very brink &amp; so invitingly its waters look Though not a thirst it urges us to drink Then comes a sloping hill &amp; whats beyond We stray to look &amp; find a little pond Where dotterel trees bend as if falling in &amp; sallow bushes of their station fond Stretch from each side &amp; welcome [surety] win Where snug the hermit morehen loves to lie Who from the passing footstep plunges in &amp; from his old haunt seldom dares to fly Now almost hid in trees a little gate Cheats us into the darkness of the wood We almost think the day is wearing late So dreamy is the light that dwells around &amp; so refreshing is its sombre mood We feel at once shut out from sun &amp; sky All the deliciousness of solitude While sauntering noisless oer the leafy ground The air we breath seems loosing every trace Of earth &amp; all its trouble &amp; the mind Yearns for a dwelling in so sweet a place From troubles noise such stillness seemeth bye Yet soon the side brings some unwelcome spire To bid the charm of solitude retire Yet still the little path winds on &amp; on Down hedgrow sides &amp; many a pastoral charm We soon forget the charm of poesy gone In the still woodland with its silent balm &amp; find some other joy to dream upon A distant notice of some nestling farm Crowded with russet stacks that peep between Hugh homestead elms or orchards squatting trees Where apples shine sun tanned &amp; mellow green Home comforts for dull winters reveries When the dull evening claimeth news &amp; friends Calm pleasure thus home nearing fancy sees That maketh vanished fancy full amends As the crooked footpath at the village ends MEADOW BUTTERFLYES Brown butterflyes in happy quiet rest Upon the blooming ragworts golden breast Giving unto the mind a sweet employ That everything in nature meets with joy Ah sweet indeed for trifles such as these Full often give my aching bosom ease When I in little walks my mind employ Aright—&amp; feel those happy reveries That nature in her varied lessons tend To bring our thinkings to a happy end &amp; in her varied moods for ever tries To make us that great blessing comprehend That spreads around us in a fond caress Emblems &amp; moods of future happiness THE REED BIRD A little slender bird of reddish brown With frequent haste pops in &amp; out the reeds &amp; on the river frequent flutters down As if for food &amp; so securely feeds Her little young that in their ambush needs Her frequent journeys hid in thickest shade Where danger never finds a path to show A fear on comforts nest securely made In woods of reeds round which the waters flow Save by a jelted stone that boys will throw Or passing rustle of the fishers boat It is the reed bird prized for pleasant note Ah happy songster man can seldom share A spot so hidden from the haunts of care THE WOODLARKS NEST The woodlark rises from the coppice tree Time after time untired she upward springs Silent while up then coming down she sings A pleasant song of varied melody Repeated often till some sudden check The sweet toned impulse of her rapture stops Then stays her trembling wings &amp; down she drops Like to a stone amid the crowding kecks Where underneath some hazels mossy root Is hid her little low &amp; humble nest Upon the ground larks love such places best &amp; here doth well her quiet station suit As safe as secresy her six eggs lie Mottled with dusky spots unseen by passers bye Yet chance will somtimes prove a faithless guest Leading some wanderer by her haunts to roam &amp; startled by the rustle from her rest She flutters out &amp; so betrays her home Yet this is seldom accident can meet With her weed hidden &amp; surrounded nest Ive often wondered when agen my feet She fluttered up &amp; fanned the anemonie That blossomed round in crowds—how birds could be So wise to find such hidden homes again &amp; this in sooth oft puzzled me—they go Far off &amp; then return—but natures plain She giveth what sufficeth them to know That they of comfort may their share retain FIELD CRICKET Sweet little minstrel of the sunny summer Housed in the pleasant swells that front the sun Neighbour to many a happy yearly comer For joys glad tidings when the winters done How doth thy music through the silk grass run That cloaths the pleasant banks with herbage new A chittering sound of healthy happiness That bids the passer bye be happy too Who hearing thee feels full of pleasant moods Picturing the cheerfulness that summers dress Brings to the eye with all her leaves &amp; grass In freshness beautified &amp; summers sounds Brings to the ear in one continued flood The luxury of joy that knows no bounds I often pause to seek thee when I pass Thy cottage in the sweet refreshing hue Of sunny flowers &amp; rich luxuriant grass But thou wert ever hidden from the view Brooding &amp; piping oer thy rural song In all the happiness of solitude Busy intruders do thy music wrong &amp; scare thy gladness dumb where they intrude Ive seen thy dwelling by the scythe laid bare &amp; thee in russet garb from bent to bent Moping without a song in silence there Till grass should bring anew thy home content &amp; leave thee to thyself to sing &amp; wear The summer through without another care THE YARROW Dweller in pastoral spots life gladly learns That nature never mars her aim to please Thy dark leaves like to clumps of little ferns Imbues my walks with feelings such as these Oertopt with swarms of flowers that charms the sight Some blushing into pink &amp; others white On meadow banks roadsides &amp; on the leas Of rough neglected pastures—I delight More even then in gardens thus to stray Amid such scenes &amp; mark thy hardy blooms Peering unto the autumns mellowing day The mowers scythe swept summer blooms away Where thou defying dreariness wilt come Bidding the lonliest russet paths be gay THE RAGWORT Ragwort thou humble flower with tattered leaves I love to see thee come &amp; litter gold What time the summer binds her russet sheaves Decking rude spots in beautys manifold That without thee were dreary to behold Sunburnt &amp; bare—the meadow bank the baulk That leads a waggonway through mellow fields Rich with the tints that harvests plenty yields Browns of all hues—&amp; everywhere I walk Thy waste of shining blossoms richly shields The sun tanned sward in splendid hues that burn So bright &amp; glaring that the very light Of the rich sunshine doth to paleness turn &amp; seems but very shadows in thy sight A SEAT IN THE MEADOWS I love to stroll the meadow when its mown &amp; all the crowd of luscious scented hay Is cleared away &amp; left the sward alone Beneath the quiet of a lovely day &amp; there I love green leisure to delay Beside some lake to find a pleasant seat To sit luxuriantly in dangers way &amp; almost let the water touch my feet A somthing so refreshing bland &amp; cool From the calm surface of the water steals What time the noontide spangles oer the pool Bringing back bits of joy past time consceals &amp; youths past visions flit accross the brain What books nor pictures never meet again UNIVERSAL GOODNESS I look on nature less with critics eyes Than with that feeling every scene supplies Feelings of reverence that warms &amp; clings Around the heart while viewing pleasing things &amp; heath &amp; pastures hedgrow stunted tree Are more than alps with all its hills to me The bramble for a bower the old molehill For seat delights me wander where I will I feel a presence of delight—&amp; fear Of love &amp; majesty far off &amp; near Go where I will its absence cannot be &amp; solitude &amp; God are one to me A presence that ones gloomiest cares caress &amp; fills up every place to guard &amp; bless THE LANE The cartway leading over every green A russet strip then winding half unseen Up narrow lanes &amp; smothered oer in shade By oak &amp; ash in meeting branches made That touch &amp; twine &amp; shut out all the sky &amp; teams will snatch to crop them driving bye Then over fields deep printed freely strays Yet crooked &amp; rambling half uncertain ways While far away fields stretch on either side &amp; skys above head spread a circle wide Letting low hedges trees snug close &amp; fields of grain An unknown world to shepherds when descried &amp; then the timid road retreats again A leaf hid luxury in a narrow lane PARTRIDGE COVEYS Among the stubbles when the fields grow grey &amp; mellow harvest gathers to a close The painful gleaner twenty times a day Start up the partridge broods that glad repose Upon the grassy slip or sunny land Yet ever it would seem in dangers way Where snufting dogs their rustling haunts betray &amp; tracking gunners ever seem at hand Oft frighted up they startle to the shade Of neighbouring wood &amp; through the yellow leaves Drop wearied where the brakes &amp; ferns hath made A solitary covert—that decieves For there the fox prowls its unnoticed round &amp; danger dares them upon every ground ON SEEING TWO SWALLOWS LATE IN OCTOBER Lone occupiers of a naked sky When desolate november hovers nigh &amp; all your fellow tribes in many crowds Have left the village with the autumn clouds Carless of old affections for the scene That made them happy when the fields were green &amp; left them undisturbed to build their nests In each old chimney like to welcome guests Forsaking all like untamed winds they roam &amp; make with summers an unsettled home Following her favours to the farthest lands Oer untraced oceans &amp; untrodden sands Like happy images they haste away &amp; leave us lonely till another may But little lingerers old esteem detains Ye haply thus to brave the chilly air When skys grow dull with winters heavy rains &amp; all the orchard trees are nearly bare Yet the old chimneys still are peeping there Above the russet thatch where summers tide Of sunny joys gave you such social fare As makes you haply wishing to abide In your old dwellings through the changing year I wish ye well to find a dwelling here For in the unsocial weather ye would fling Gleanings of comfort through the winter wide Twitting as wont above the old fireside &amp; cheat the surly winter into spring THE BRAMBLE Spontaneous flourisher in thickets lone Curving a most impenetrable way To all save nutters when a tree has shown Ripe clusters to the autumns mellow day &amp; long the brustle of the rude affray Clings to thy branches—scraps of garments torn Of many hues red purple green &amp; grey From scrambling maid who tugs the branches down &amp; inly smiles at the strange garb she wears While rough in hasty speech the brushing clown Leg hoppled as in tethers turns &amp; swears &amp; cuts the bramble strings with oath &amp; frown Yet scorn wronged bush taste marks thee worthy praise Green mid the underwood of winter days THE SURRY TREE Tree of the tawny berry rich though wild When mellowed to a pulp yet little known Though shepherds by its dainty taste beguiled Swarm with clasped leg the smooth trunk timber grown &amp; pulls the very topmost branches down Tis beautiful when all the woods tan brown To see thee thronged with berrys ripe &amp; fine For daintier palates fitting then the clown Where hermits of a day may rove &amp; dine Luxuriantly amid thy crimson leaves When different shades in different garbs appear &amp; furze spread heath a deeper green recieves &amp; fancy every sort of feeling weaves &amp; autumn comes &amp; mellows all the year THE SPINDLE TREE Tis pleasant in our walks to meet with things Simple yet new—paths frequent traced diserns Such the spurge laurel that obscurely springs Among the underwood &amp; different ferns That hid themselves in leaves the summer through Now shining rich &amp; resolutely green When leaves save weeds are else but scant &amp; few Yet one gay bush is beautifully seen As full of berries as its twigs can be Glittering &amp; pink as blossoms washed in dew Gleams the gay burthen of the spindle tree The old mans beard the saplings grains pursues Like feathers hung with rime—but autumns showers Makes their rich berries shine like summer flowers LABOURS LEISURE O for the feelings &amp; the carless health That found me toiling in the fields—the joy I felt at eve with not a wish for wealth When labour done &amp; in the hedge put by My delving spade—I homeward used to hie With thoughts of books I often read by stealth Beneath the black thorn clumps at dinners hour It urged my weary feet with eager speed To hasten home where winter fires did shower Scant light now felt as beautiful indeed Where bending oer my knees I used to read With earnest heed all books that had the power To give me joy in most delicious ways &amp; rest my spirits after weary days Aye when long summer showers lets labour win Sweet leisure—how I used to mark with joy The south grow black &amp; blacker to the eye Till the rain came &amp; pepsed me to the skin No matter anxious happiness was bye With her refreshing pictures through the rain Carless of bowering bush &amp; sheltering tree I homeward hied to feed on books again For they were then a very feast to me The simplest things were sweetest melody &amp; nothing met my eager taste in vain &amp; thus to read I often wished for rain Such leisure fancys fed my lowly lot Possessing nothing &amp; still wanting not It is an happiness that simplest hearts Find their own joy in what they undertake That nature like the seasons so imparts That every mind its own home comfort makes That be our dwelling in the fields or woods No matter custom so endears the scenes We feel in lonliness sweet company &amp; many a varied pleasure intervenes Which the wide world unnoting passes bye Pursuing what delights it varied joy Thus happiness is with us joys succeed Spontaneous every where like summer weeds The cheerful commoners of every spot Blessing the highest &amp; the lowliest lot HEAVY DEW The night hath hung the morning smiles in showers The kingcups burnished all so rich within Hang down their slender branches on the grass The bumble bees on the hugh thistle flowers Clings as half sleeping yet &amp; motion lacks Not even stirring as I closely pass Save that they lift their legs above their backs In trembling dread when touched—yet still they lie Fearful of danger without power to flye The shepherd makes a mort of crooked tracks His dog half drowned &amp; dripping to the skin Stops oft &amp; shakes his shaggy hide in vain Wading through grass like rivers to the chin Then snorts &amp; barks &amp; brushes on again APRIL SHOWERS Delightful weather for all sorts of moods &amp; most for him—grey morn &amp; swarthy eve Found rambling up the little narrow lane Where primrose banks amid the hazly woods Peep most delightfully on passers bye While aprils little clouds about the sky Mottle &amp; freak &amp; unto fancy lie Idling &amp; ending travel for the day Till darker clouds sail up with cumberous heave South oer the woods &amp; scares them all away Then comes the rain pelting with pearly drops The primrose crowds untill they stoop &amp; lie All fragrance to his mind that musing stops Beneath the awthorn till the shower is bye NUTTERS The rural occupations of the year Are each a fitting theme for pastoral song &amp; pleasing in our autumn paths appear The groups of nutters as they chat along The woodland rides in strangest dissabille Maids jacketed grotesque in garments ill Hiding their elegance of shape—her ways Her voice of music makes her woman still Aught else the error of a carless gaze Might fancy uncooth rustics noising bye With laugh &amp; chat &amp; scraps of morning news Till met the hazel shades &amp; in they hie Garbed suiting to the toil—the morning dews Among the underwood are hardly dry Yet down with crack &amp; rustle branches come &amp; springing up like bow unloosed when free Of their ripe clustering bunches brown—while some Are split &amp; broken under many a tree Up springs the blundering pheasant with the noise Loud brawls the maiden to her friends scared sore &amp; loud with mimic voice mischevous boys Ape stranger voices to affright her more Eccho long silent answers many a call Straggling about the wildwoods guessing way Till by the wood side waiting one &amp; all They gather homward at the close of day While maids with hastier step from sheperds brawl Speed on half shamed of their strange dissaray MIST IN THE MEADOWS The evening oer the meadow seems to stoop More distant lessens the diminished spire Mist in the hollows reeks &amp; curdles up Like fallen clouds that spread—&amp; things retire Less seen &amp; less—the shepherd passes near &amp; little distant most grotesquely shades As walking without legs—lost to his knees As through the rawky creeping smoke he wades Now half way up the arches dissappear &amp; small the bits of sky that glimmer through Then trees loose all but tops—I meet the fields &amp; now the indistinctness passes bye The shepherd all his length is seen again &amp; further on the village meets the eye SIGNS OF WINTER Tis winter plain the images around Protentious tell us of the closing year Short grows the stupid day the moping fowl Go roost at noon—upon the mossy barn The thatcher hangs &amp; lays the frequent yaum Nudged close to stop the rain that drizzling falls With scarce one interval of sunny sky For weeks still leeking on that sulky gloom Muggy &amp; close a doubt twixt night &amp; day The sparrow rarely chirps the thresher pale Twanks with sharp measured raps the weary frail Thump after thump right tiresome to the ear The hedger lonesome brustles at his toil &amp; shepherds trudge the fields without a song The cat runs races with her tail—the dog Leaps oer the orchard hedge &amp; knarls the grass The swine run round &amp; grunt &amp; play with straw Snatching out hasty mouthfuls from the stack Sudden upon the elm tree tops the crow Uncerimonious visit pays &amp; croaks Then swops away—from mossy barn the owl Bobs hasty out—wheels round &amp; scared as soon As hastily retires—the ducks grow wild &amp; from the muddy pond fly up &amp; wheel A circle round the village &amp; soon tired Plunge in the pond again—the maids in haste Snatch from the orchard hedge the mizled cloaths &amp; laughing hurry in to keep them dry ANGLING Angling has pleasures that are much enjoyed By tasteful minds of nature never cloyed In pleasant solitudes where winding floods Pass level meadows &amp; oerhanging woods Verged with tall reeds that rustle in the wind A soothing music in the anglers mind &amp; rush right complasant that ever bows Obesceience to the stream that laughs below He feels delighted into quiet praise &amp; sweet the pictures that the mind essays While gentle whispers on the southern wind Brings health &amp; quiet to the anglers mind Smooth as the gentle river whirls along &amp; sweet as memory of some happy song The morn is still &amp; balmy all that moves The trees are south gales which the angler loves That stirs the waveing grass in idle whirls &amp; flush the cheeks &amp; fan the jetty curls Of milking maidens at their morns employ Who sing &amp; wake the dewy fields to joy The sun just rising large &amp; round &amp; dim Keeps creeping up oer the flat meadows brim As rising from the ground to run its race Till up it mounts &amp; shows a ruddy face Now is the time the angler leaves his dreams In anxious movements for the silent streams Frighting the heron from its morning toil First at the river watching after coil Now with the rivers brink he winds his way For a choice place to spend the quiet day Marking its banks how varied things appear Now cloathed in trees &amp; bushes &amp; now clear While steep the bank climbs from the waters edge Then almost choaked with rushes flags &amp; sedge Then flat &amp; level to the very brink Tracked deep by cattle running there to drink At length he finds a spot half shade half sun That scarcely curves to show the waters run Still clear &amp; smooth quick he his line unlaps While fish leap up &amp; loud the water claps Which fills his mind with pleasures of supprise That in the deep hole some old monster lies Right cautious now his strongest line to take Lest some hugh monster should his tackle break Then half impatient with a cautious throw He swings his line into the depths below The water rat hid in the shivering reeds That feeds upon the slime &amp; water weeds Nibbling their grassy leaves with crizzling sound Plunges below &amp; makes his fancys bound With expectations joy—down goes the book In which glad leisure might for pleasure look &amp; up he grasps the angle in his hand In readiness the expected prize to land While tip toe hope gives expectations dream Sweet as the sunshine sleeping on the stream None but true anglers feel that gush of joy That flushes in the patient minds employ While expectation upon tiptoe sees The float just wave it cannot be a breeze For not a waver oer the waters pass Warm with the joyous day &amp; smooth as glass Now stronger moved it dances round then stops Then bobs again &amp; in a moment drops Beneath the water—he with joys elate Pulls &amp; his rod bends double with the weight True was his skill in hopes expecting dream &amp; up he draws a flat &amp; curving bream That scarcely landed from the tackle drops &amp; on the bank half thronged in sedges stops Now sport the waterflyes with tiny wings A dancing crowd imprinting little rings &amp; the rich light the suns young splendours throw Is by the very pebbles caught below Behind the leaning tree he stoops to lean &amp; soon the stirring float again is seen A larger yet from out its ambush shoots Hid underneath the old trees cranking roots The float now shakes &amp; quickens his delight Then bobs a moment &amp; is out of sight Which scarce secured—down goes the cork again &amp; still a finer pants upon the plain &amp; bounds &amp; flounces mid the newmown hay &amp; luck but ceases with the closing day WINTER FIELDS O for a pleasant book to cheat the sway Of winter—where rich mirth with hearty laugh Listens &amp; rubs his legs on corner seat For fields are mire &amp; sludge—&amp; badly off Are those who on their pudgy paths delay There striding shepherd seeking driest way Fearing nights wetshod feet &amp; hacking cough That keeps him waken till the peep of day Goes shouldering onward &amp; with ready hook Progs off to ford the sloughs that nearly meet Accross the lands—croodling &amp; thin to view His loath dog follows—stops &amp; quakes &amp; looks For better roads—till whistled to pursue Then on with frequent jump he hirkles through BIRDS &amp; SPRING The happy birds in their delight bring home To our own doors the news that spring is come Eave haunting sparrow that no song employs Pull off the apple blooms for very joys &amp; that delightful neighbour ever merry The Robin with a bosom like a cherry Comes to the threshold welcome pert &amp; bold Where crumbs lay littered when the day was cold &amp; whistles out so loud the folks within Jump with supprise &amp; wonder at the din &amp; when they run to see supprise will smile Scarcely believing Robins sung so loud But spring is come &amp; he is overproud To see young leaves that nothing comes to spoil WINTER EVENING The crib stocks fothered—horses suppered up &amp; cows in sheds all littered down in straw The threshers gone the owls are left to whoop The ducks go waddling with distended craw Through little hole made in the henroost door &amp; geese with idle gabble never oer Bate careless hog untill he tumbles down Insult provoking spite to noise the more While fowl high perched blink with contemptous frown On all the noise &amp; bother heard below Over the stable ridge in crowds the crow With jackdaws intermixed known by their noise To the warm woods behind the village go &amp; whistling home for bed go weary boys SNOW STORM Winter is come in earnest &amp; the snow In dazzling splendour—crumping underfoot Spreads a white world all calm &amp; where we go By hedge or wood trees shine from top to root In feathered foliage flashing light &amp; shade Of strangest contrast—fancys pliant eye Delighted sees a vast romance displayed &amp; fairy halls descended from the sky The smallest twig its snowy burthen wears &amp; woods oer head the dullest eyes engage To shape strange things—where arch &amp; pillar bears A roof of grains fantastic arched &amp; high &amp; little shed beside the spinney wears The grotesque zemblance of an hermitage On[e] almost sees the hermit from the wood Come bending with his sticks beneath his arm &amp; then the smoke curl up its dusky flood From the white little roof his peace to warm One shapes his books his quiet &amp; his joys &amp; in romances world forgetting mood The scene so strange so fancys mind employs It seems heart aching for his solitude Domestic spots near home &amp; trod so oft Seen daily—known for years—by the strange wand Of winters humour changed—the little croft Left green at night when morns loth look obtrudes Trees bushes grass to one wild garb subdued Are gone &amp; left us in another land A THAW The snows are gone or nearly chance may show Beside the dripping hedge some little hills Fast drop the eves till pudges plash below &amp; every rut &amp; hollow quickly fills In huzzing crowds cote-piegons too &amp; fro Traverse the villages &amp; at the stack Hang flapping—in an instant up they go From slaughtering gun its momentary crack While barn &amp; dove cote sound the echo back They circle round &amp; round &amp; settle soon— The homstead cows their old accustomed track Keep to the foddering place throughout the day Untill the boys hoarse brawl at hazy noon Comes with his fork &amp; litters heaps of hay THE BLACKCAP Under the twigs the blackcap hangs in vain With snowwhite patch streaked over either eye This way &amp; that he turns &amp; peeps again As wont where silk-cased insects used to lie But summer leaves are gone the day is bye For happy holidays &amp; now he fares But cloudy like the weather yet to view He flirsts a happy wing &amp; inly wears Content in gleaning what the orchard spares &amp; like his little couzin capped in blue Domesticates the lonely winter through In homestead plots &amp; gardens where he wears Familiar pertness—yet but seldom comes With the tame robin to the door for crumbs NIGHT WIND Darkness like midnight from the sobbing woods Clamours with dismal tidings of the rain Roaring as rivers breaking loose in floods To spread &amp; foam &amp; deluge all the plain The cotter listens at his door again Half doubting wether it be floods or wind &amp; through the thickening darkness looks affraid Thinking of roads that travel has to find Through nights black depths in dangers garb arrayed &amp; the loud glabber round the flaze soon stops When hushed to silence by the lifted hand Of fearing dame who hears the noise in dread &amp; thinks a deluge comes to drown the land Nor dares she go to bed untill the tempest drops BIRDS NESTS How fresh the air the birds how busy now In every walk if I but peep I find Nests newly made or finished all &amp; lined With hair &amp; thistle down &amp; in the bough Of little awthorn huddled up in green The leaves still thickening as the spring gets age The Pinks quite round &amp; snug &amp; closely laid &amp; linnets of materials loose &amp; rough &amp; still hedge sparrow moping in the shade Near the hedge bottom weaves of homely stuff Dead grass &amp; mosses green an hermitage For secresy &amp; shelter rightly made &amp; beautiful it is to walk beside The lanes &amp; hedges where their homes abide WOOD RIDES Who hath not felt the influence that so calms The weary mind in summers sultry hours When wandering thickest woods beneath the arms Of ancient oaks &amp; brushing nameless flowers That verge the little ride who hath not made A minutes waste of time &amp; sat him down Upon a pleasant swell to gaze awhile On crowding ferns bluebells &amp; hazel leaves &amp; showers of ladysmocks so called by toil When boys sprote gathering sit on stulps &amp; weave Garlands while barkmen pill the fallen tree —Then mid the green variety to start Who hath [not] met that mood from turmoil free &amp; felt a placid joy refreshed at heart THE HEDGE WOODBINE The common woodbine in the hedgerow showers A multitude of blossoms &amp; from thence The tinctured air all fragrance on the sense Flings richest sweets that almost overpowers &amp; faintness pauls the taste which goes away When some old ballad beautifully sung Comes through the hedge with crowded fragrance hung From merry maidens tossing up the hay To list the sunny mirth we inly feel That none but beautys self could sing so well &amp; pastoral visions on our fancys dwell Our joys excess joys inmost thoughts consceal The woodbine hedge—the maids half toil half play —Words like to clouds obscure &amp; wear away EARLY MORNING Morn with her sober shadows tall &amp; thin Stalks forth a field with slow &amp; solemn stride Like thinking poet some new joy to win &amp; in its little clump of trees espied The mossy cottage hidden like a nest Smokes from its plastered chimney while the lark Sings oer her nestlings in the neighbouring corn There toil made stirring by the restless cock His early breakfast hastily prepares &amp; stooping hies afield its earliest guest &amp; happiest—for he sings from light to dark Tracking the grassy pathways night &amp; morn He ask[s] of passing stranger whats o'clock &amp; heeds but little save his own affairs HAPPINESS OF EVENING The winter wind with strange &amp; fearful gust Stirs the dark wood &amp; in the lengthy night Howls in the chimney top while fears mistrust Listens the noise by the small glimmering light Of cottage hearth where warm a circle sits Of happy dwellers telling morts of tales Where some long memory wakens up by fits Laughter &amp; fear &amp; over all prevails Wonder predominant—they sit &amp; hear The very hours to minutes &amp; the song Or story be the subject what it may Is ever found too short &amp; never long While the uprising tempest loudly roars &amp; boldest hearts fear stirring out of doors Fears ignorance their fancy only harms Doors safely locked fear only entrance wins While round the fire in every corner warms Till nearest hitch away &amp; rub their shins &amp; now the tempest in its plight begins The shutters jar the woodbine on the wall Rustles agen the panes &amp; over all The noisey storm to troublous fancy dins &amp; pity stirs the stoutest heart to call “Who's there” as slow the door latch seemly stirred But nothing answered so the sounds they heard Was no benighted traveller—&amp; they fall To telling pleasant tales to conquor fear &amp; sing a merry song till bedtime creepeth near</field>
