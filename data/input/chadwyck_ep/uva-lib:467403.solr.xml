      <field name="fulltext">RECOLLECTIONS OF CHARLES LAMB. The following verse has been extracted from prose text. [âIn my quiet garden-room] âIn my quiet garden-room Where I pass my pensive hours, And enjoy the sweet perfume Wafted by my fragrant flow'rs, Pensioners from every spray, Me their morning visits pay. Timidly aloof they stand, Till grown tamer, they at last, Perching upon my open'd hand, Partake, with songs, of my repastâ 'Tis then I learn from every bough How cheap, O Happiness! art thou. And as this feast (too young to fly), Their unfledged nestlings cannot share, They to their leafy homes on high A little part rejoicing bear; Then this parental duty done, Again they soaring, seek the sun. When winter chills the parting year, And falls the snow, and roars the wind, My truants daily disappear; The Robin only stays behind, And does his best to make amends, Till spring returns, for absent friends. Will they return with spring? How few!â By driving storm, and leafless tree, By bitter frost, and damp night-dew, Full many a voice shall silenced be; And he who spreads their feast to-day May too, ere spring, have pass'd away.â [âBricks and mortar! bricks and mortar!] âBricks and mortar! bricks and mortar! Cut your rambles rather shorter, Give green fields a little quarter! You, in your suburban sallies, Turn our pleasant fields and valleys Into squalid courts and alleys. All along our rural passes Where tripp'd village lads and lasses Not a single blade of grass is! Where I saw the daisies springing, Where I heard the blackbird singing, And the lark while heavenward winging, I behold a rookery frightful Which with tatters (tenants rightful!) Beggary fills from morn to night full. And beside their neighbour wizen For rogues I see a palace risen, And for poverty a prison! Bricks and mortar! bricks and mortar! Give green fields a little quarter; As sworn foes to nature's beauty You've already done your duty!â [âHe fell asleep. He sank to rest] âHe fell asleep. He sank to rest Serenely on his Saviour's breast; His Master's work, like David's, done; His crown, like David's, nobly won! He fell asleep. To death resign'd, No anxious wish he left behind, But that his friends some happy day Might pass, like him, in peace away. He fell asleep. He finds repose In that green, silent spot he chose, And many a pensive pilgrim there, In fond remembrance, breathes a prayer.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SAMUEL JOHNSON. The following verse has been extracted from prose text. THE NEW YEAR. âBy the God of Mercy's pleasure I am still a Pilgrim here (Loving-kindness without measure!) To behold the new-born year. With the balmy breath of morning Comes a voice that seems to say, Heaven vouchsafes another warning, See thou cast it not away. Happy thou that dost not slumber (They had too their warnings here) With the unconverted number Gone with the departed year! O! if ever sin enthrall'd thee, Let it not enthral again; O! if ever wisdom call'd thee, Let her no more call in vain. Keep thy passions in subjection, Banish every thought impure, Yield thyself to God's direction, Hold thy faith unshaken, sure. Should He in the furnace try thee, Pray for patience, strength to bear; Knowing He is ever nigh thee, Prompt to hear and answer pray'r. Are the lines in pleasant places? Has His bounty hope outran? Let shine forth thy Christian graces In benevolence to man. Ever to that holy mountain Where thy Prophet, Priest, and King Freely open'd mercy's fountain Let thy faith her offering bring. She can bring no other token That thou would'st the past retrieve, But a contrite heart, and broken, Which thy Saviour will receive. For the promise of salvation, For compassion so divine, Let thy soul, in adoration, All the world for Him resign.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PRESUMED DISINTERMENT OF MILTON. The following verse has been extracted from prose text. A MIDSUMMER MORNING'S DREAM. Contented, grateful, and resign'd, As o'er the past my memory ran, Upon my pillow I reclined, At peace, I hoped, with God and man, When with the morning's earliest beam Came o'er me a celestial Dream. Methought the icy hand of death Unbarr'd my earthly prison door, And far from sin's defiling breath, My free and happy soul did soar To realize her promised rest Among the spirits of the blest. That tuneful harps of many strings, And voices jubilant aloud Gave Glory to the King of Kings, And saints and white-robed seraphs bow'd In adoration at the feet Of Him who fill'd the Mercy-seat. That those whom earth had never prized, The contrite-hearted, the cast down, The poor, the humble, the despised, And they who wore the martyr's crown, The royal courts of Zion trod, And stood at the right hand of God. That in the highest Heaven of Heaven Salvation's symbol shone unveil'd; That myriads then of souls forgiven Its brightness with hosannas hail'd! And, at the brazen trumpet's blast, Their golden crowns before it cast! That so entrancing, so intense The glories of this vision grew, I seem'd to lose both sight and sense, 'Twas then it faded from my view; The voice of melody was still, And darkness fell on Zion's hill, And silent were the harp and lute, When, in the mist, methought I heard, Sweeter than the sweetest flute, An unseen, solitary bird Piping a note that seem'd to say, âAh! let me to the woods away. âThe robin red-breast, and the thrush, The blackbird, linnet, and the lark, From every bloomy brake and bush Invite me home again, and hark! I hear a sweeter voice than all, My lonely mate's endearing call.â And now, alas! dissolved the dream That had to heaven my spirit borne, And I beheld Aurora's beam Refulgent, lighting up the morn; And saw in all its plumy pride My serenader by my side! What brought thee, tuneful stranger, here? Art thou the harbinger of bliss? The herald from some happier sphere To tell me (joyful tidings!) this? âThe day's at hand when heaven to thee Shall not a transient vision be!â Poor little captive! ill at ease! It fluttering to the window flew, Which when I open'd to the breeze, It clapp'd its wings, and chirp'd adieu! And vanish'd in the azure bright, Singing and soaring with delight. I thought upon my morning dream; And how I panted to return Again to that celestial beam Where angels sing and seraphs burn; And, like the throstle to its nest, Soar to my everlasting rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHAT IS HAPPINESS? The following verse has been extracted from prose text. [âI gave the world a trial fair] âI gave the world a trial fair, Resolved to thrive as some had thriven; I gave it all my time and care, And talents, such as God had given. I hurried to the busy Bourse, With men of all religions traded, For nothing better, nothing worse, Than just to win and laugh as they did. That man is born to buy and sell, Soon I learnt was very certain, And over-reach his neighbour well Till upon him drops death's curtain; Yet still his race with credit run, If Plutus has his pockets linedâ Since this rare merit is the one To which the world is never blind. I wish'd my schoolboy's lessons burnt, Probity (the pedant!) preachingâ And that I had others learnt, Very different tactics teaching! Now wishes, I have heard are prayers; Ah! then how stole upon my praying, Like a grim goblin! unawares, The ghost of some dead saw, or saying; It held my hands, it closed my lips, (A bargain, plague upon it! spoiling;) But kept my tongue from sundry slips, And saved my hands from many a soiling. Charity would make a call; Love, perchance; and friendship tooâ Mammon, tell intruders all, I'm at home to none but you! Sabbath-bells would ring a pealâ What day could I devote to heaven, The jealous God to whom I kneel Demanding sternly all the seven? Had Eden bloom'd my sight was dim To floral beauty; deaf my ear To the rapt Seraph's holiest hymn, Had its high notes descended hereâ And fairy-fiction, fancy truth, Let your neglected pages tell, Companions of my happy youth! How I had bid you all farewell. Unholy service! to absorb The soul, and quench the living flame That lights the intellectual orb Of God's own glorious imageâshame! The sleepless night has heard my cry, âWould that again the morn were here!â The cheerless morn my secret sigh, âWhen will the moon and stars appear?â I felt, with care, the silver cord Was slowly, but too surely, breaking; I felt, if peace were not restored, My heart would soon have done with aching. I now despair'd of keeping pace With rivals, by success made bold, In an ignominious race Of which the only prize was gold! To fall in such a sordid strife, When I might still with honour fly, Was casting back to heaven a life, And the eternal death to die! Reason's battle fought and won, No longer yoked to Mammon's car, Joy meets me with the morning sun, And quiet, with the evening star, And happy thoughts, and holy themes, And cheerful converse, as of old, And peaceful slumbers, pleasant dreamsâ And here my latest dream is told. The Vision was a Spirit bright, The laurel wreathed her golden hair, Her smile was sad, but full of light, Her voice was soft, her form was fair. âA nobler cause, a higher aim, Your new ambition shall inspireââ (With this kind promise Clio came, And bade me take her trembling lyre.) âFor mourners 'tis a present meet, And therefore to a mourner given; It brings to sorrow solace sweet, In songs for earth, and songs for heaven.â Thrice happy change! no more in vain The sweetly-solemn music swells (To call, Good Shepherd! home again A wandering sheep) of Sabbath Bells.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">UNCLE TIMOTHY AT HOME. The following verse has been extracted from prose text. [âAnother Star has left its sphere] âAnother Star has left its sphere, In happier, holier realms to rise; Dark clouds eclipsed its brightness here, Its lustre hid from human eyes. Yet were that risen radiant star (A ransomed Spirit!) but in sight, 'Twould be a lamp exceeding far All that we here have seen of light. Its heavenly music now is heard, (That music hushed, alas! so long) Its strings of harmony are stirred, The Saviour's Sacrifice its song! He died; then broke death's prison bars; He rose again from earth and time; That souls redeem'd might shine as Stars Before His Father's Throne sublime.â [ââLet those laugh that win,â is a saying in vogue] âWhat news from Parnassus, my merry masters? What (opening the first paper that was handed to him) sings Autolicus? ââLet those laugh that win,â is a saying in vogue Very glib (like a fib!) with the prosperous rogue. ââLet those laugh that win,â cries the âShop,â with a grin, When it has taken a customer in! ââLet those laugh that win,â in a risible fit, Is Mammon's salute to a capital hit. ââLet those that win,ââ is the jubilant cry Of Good-luck and Company's fortunate fry, Poor Honesty only, through thick and through thin, Has never yet chuckled âLet those laugh that win.â âSoft words, but hard arguments! What says Touchstone? ââDe mortuis nil nisi bonumââ Spare dead rascals, let alone 'em! Memories so rank and rotten Should be by Charity forgotten. ââDe mortuis nil nisiâ Verum! Gibbet knaves; that knaves may fear 'em! And from their example learn They shall be gibbetted in turn! ââBonum?â âVerum!â Never, never Truth, from dead or living, fever. âMischief in miniature! who takes a turn at the churn, or a swig at the home-brewed with equal gustoâNow for thy âsilver penny.â ââForget and Forgive.ââIf I can do the one, Without further doing, the other is done! Put but âForgiveâ in the place of its brother, My heart shall try one, while my brain tries the other. But this will I promise (for injuries live) What my brain can't âForget,â why my heart shall âForgive.ââ Here Uncle Timothy peeped over his spectacles at Puck; paused, and then called upon Othello. ââTwo blacks don't make a white,â Very right, Sir; very right. You than most men being meaner, Makes me not a bit the cleaner. Differing only in degree, A pretty pair of rogues are we! âCurt and pert! Now for Sir John Falstaff. ââTell the truth and shame the sire Of every lie, and every liar.â Telling truth would Pelion level Quite as soon as âshame the Devil.â Tell the truth, and fibbers rather Make ashamed of such a father! âStarved Apothecary! âMake hay while the sun shines.â So I would have done, If on my poor pasture had e'er shone the sun. âShylock. Son, thy yearly âgroatâ to win, Pick up Mammon's daily âpin;â And when up the pin thou pickest (Where the mud is blackest, thickest), Think what life is; what a boon To money-grubs beneath the moon! Ending just as it begins, In picking up, and hoarding âpins.â âTrinculo. âThe end shall justify the means.â âTrue!â says Satan, behind the scenes. But if from evil good's to come, Leave the old sinner to work his sum! âTimon. Where's âCharityâ all winter been? At home! She abroad was never seen To roam. Against the cold and cutting blast She barr'd her doors and windows fast. But now the weather's bright, and warm, And clear, She will let her tender form Appear; And for long absence make amends By going out to see her friends. âGoodman Dogberry. Gossip! gossip! he advi-sed, âA still tongue doth make a wise head.â Rather say, Sir, rather say, It don't that empty head betray; So of gravity the visor Makes a fool look all the wiser. âOrlando. âMoney makes the mare to go.â Very quick, or very slow! If your purse be pretty hot, She will start into a trot; If from hot, it hotter grow, She, full gallop, off will go! If its strings be tightened all, How the jade will creep and crawl! But if finally at fault, Rosinante makes a halt! [âEre the parting year expire] âEre the parting year expire, Ere is toll'd its solemn knell, Let me of myself inquire, Have I spent it ill, or well? Was it to my Maker given? Or to Mammon sold a slave? Am I one step nearer heaven, As I'm many to the grave? Have I let Religion's light Shine upon the path I trod, That man, her beauty seeing, might Glorify the Living God? From the burning have I striven Other brands for Him to save? Am I one step nearer heaven As I'm many to the grave?â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE BIRTHDAY. The following verse has been extracted from prose text. [Book of Life! Salvation's charter!] Book of Life! Salvation's charter! Where, with hallow'd lips of fire, Spake Apostle, Prophet, Martyr, As the Spirit did inspire. Guide the holiest, safest, surest, To lost man, in mercy, given To lead him in that path the purest, The Pilgrim's path from earth to heaven. From thee I learn how rose the sun, And world on world from chaos rude; How, when His wondrous work was done, Jehovah's Self pronounced it âGood.â How beauty, order, grandeur, grace, All centred in Creation's plan; With Eden for the dwelling-place Of that exalted BeingâMan! How from his high and happy state, Alas! he fell; and by his fall Brought Sin and Death, the woes that wait On Disobedience, upon all. How pity touch'd the Father's heart, And sent from His celestial throne His only Son to bear our smart, For man's transgression to atone. How earth was darken'd, mountains heaved, And lightning flash'd, and thunder peal'd, And trembling infidels believed, As His great bond the Saviour seal'd. And how supreme He reigns above, With Glory's Diadem to crown The Chosen of His dying love, For whom He brought Redemption down. Book of Life! I learn from Thee All that is meet for man to know, That God is mercy, pardon free To those who seek it here below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ROBERT CRUIKSHANK. The following verse has been extracted from prose text. MAY-DAY OFFERING. When, by Religion's sacred light Creation opens to my sight, Methinks, surveying all around, I tread upon enchanted ground. For, view'd by her celestial beam, The heavens more grand and glorious seem; And, borrowing beauty from above, Earth looks more fair, and full of love. The feather'd songsters, as they rise, More joyfully salute the skies; The woodland-stream's meandering flow With sweeter music murmurs low. A holier calm pervades the deep, Its rippling waves in sunshine sleep; And in the distance sea and sky In blended beauty melt and die. Responsive to some inward voice, All Nature seems to cry, âRejoice!â And some divinity to bring New life to every living thing! The everlasting mountains more Majestically seem to soar,â The rugged rocks, sublimely stern, With haughtier brow the waves to spurn. And now upon the landscape fall Night's sable shadows, like a pall; And moon and stars new awe inspire Lit by that flame of heavenly fire! Frail man! for whom these wonders are; (Thyself more wondrous! fallen star!) What canst thou do?âNor less, nor more, In dust and ashes, but adore.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">TRUTH AND ERROR. AN EPISTLE TO EUGENIO. The following verse has been extracted from prose text. [I know in whom I have believed] I know in whom I have believed, To whom my faith was given; Who sinner never yet deceived That put his trust in heaven. He shed upon my infant day The beauteous dawn of truth, Illumined with a brighter ray The advent of my youth. And when in manhood's path I trod, In full meridian shone The Word of Truthâthe Word of God, To light me to His throne! With many winters on my brow, That living Lamp Divine Did never brighter shine than now Within this heart of mine. Lamp! to the last thy temple keep, Let nothing dim thy ray, Till I in Jesus fall asleep, To meet the Judgment Day. Uncle Timothy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FAREWELL! The following verse has been extracted from prose text. [Hope to the last!âThough Hope delay] Hope to the last!âThough Hope delay, Do we lose by hoping? Nay, Rather we a respite gain From anxiety and pain, One of that celestial Three, Of whom the chief is Charity, Let me to the very last, Hope eternal! hold thee fast. [Sleep in thy Father's clay-cold arms and breast] Sleep in thy Father's clay-cold arms and breast Till the Last Trumpet wake thee from thy rest. Life's little day Of innocence and joy hath passed away. To thee was known one parentâonly oneâ Ere thy brief race began thy sire's was runâ In manhood's prime His mission calmly closed with earth and time. Sin never sullied theeâwithout a stain Thy spirit to thy God returns again. What higher bliss Hath Heaven in store for those it loves than this? [Why, alas! of life so weary?] Why, alas! of life so weary? So dispirited, cast down? Is thy path perplex'd and dreary? Does upon thee fortune frown? Or thy love look cold, and shun thee? Or ingratitude's sharp fang From the friend who has undone thee Add to poverty its pang? One above there is to bless thee, (Think what sorrows here He bore!) Who the more that wrongs oppress thee, Only loves thee more and more. [How I love the gates of Zion] How I love the gates of Zion Morn and eve to enter in, With the Gospel to rely on As a pardon for my sin. How I lean on every sentence, As it falls upon my ear, Promising of true repentance Pitying Heaven my vows will hear. See, in silent adoration Rich and poor together kneel, Hark! what hymns of jubilation From the full-toned organ peal. Every voice the chorus swelling! Every eye uplifted, fired! Every tongue of mercies telling! Every bosom rapt, inspired! Well may ye exalt your voices, Heirs of glory! chosen sons! Every ransomed saint rejoices As his Christian course he runs. Pain and sorrow cannot move him, Pressing on to his reward; Death's dark terrors only prove him Looking, longing for his Lord. [The Morning of the Intellect! as first in Adam seen] The Morning of the Intellect! as first in Adam seen In all its pristine purity, ah! what must it have been? A Temple of the Living God! refulgent and refined; An emanation glorious of the Eternal Mind! The Morning of the Intellect! Ere horrid sin and death Its innocence and beauty marr'd with their defiling breath; Or time made it a mournful wreck, a ruin, just to tell How low it has descended, and from what a height it fell! The Morning of the Intellect! In these our latter days If something noble still remain for wonder and for praise, What is it but a relic rare of that Celestial Fane To be restored when man shall his Lost Paradise regain? [Lord! to praise Thee we appear] Lord! to praise Thee we appear In Thy Holy Temple here, That Thou didst (the children's friend) These our kind protectors send. But for them (inspired by Thee) We should helpless outcasts be, To the world an easy prey, Scatter'd, tempted, cast away! By their bounty clothed and fed, By their counsel taught and led, With Thy help we hope to steer From the path of error clear. Make us diligent and good, Fill our hearts with gratitude, Let our knowledge be to know All we have to Thee we owe. Ever in our infant sight Be Thy Son a pattern bright! When, with so Divine a mien, Was such early wisdom seen? Him to follow, Thee to praise Humbly, truly, all our days, To what service, holier, higher, Lord, than this can we aspire? [Not until Thy work was done] Not until Thy work was done, Faithful servant of the Lord! And thy Crown of Glory won, (Self-devotion's sure reward!) Didst thou at the Master's feet Lay thy crook, so meekly borne, And (thy sleep of death how sweet!) Wake to an Eternal Morn. Now the blessed of thy fold Thou hast heard with rapt surprise, (Robed in white,) with harps of gold Hail thy advent to the skies; As before the Throne of Light They beheld thee prostrate fallâ Faith and Hope confirm'd by sight, And Christ the Saviour All in All! Though in sorrow we abide, (Be the parting tear forgiven!) We're not left without a guide In our homeward path to Heaven. Thy example handed down Is the star by which to steer, If, like thee, to glory's crown We would prove our title clear. [Who has not in its splendour mild] Who has not in its splendour mild A golden sunset seen? Or look'd upon a sleeping child, And mark'd its brow serene? Or watch'd upon a summer's eve (By tempests lash'd no more) A rippling wave the billows leave, To die upon the shore? And who has not the Christian view'd, When life draws near its close, His doubts and fears by faith subdued, His spirit in repose? As sleeping childhood, sunset bright, And the retiring wave, So sweetly calm, with Heaven in sight, He passes to the grave. [Swift from earth (too glad to leave it!)] Swift from earth (too glad to leave it!) My enraptured spirit flies; In Thy Bosom, Lord! receive it, With a welcome to the skies. There to live with saints for ever Under Thy celestial reign, Where temptation, sorrow, never Shall disturb its peace again. FAREWELL!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">âNON OMNIS MORIAR!â âOn some fond breast the parting soul relies, Some pious drops the closing eye requires; Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries, Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.â Gray. The Man of Sorrows!ââMournful name! To soften hearts the best appeal, To kindle faith's undying flame, And love's Divinest, warmest zeal. No name by which the Lord is known Can a more tender charm impart; Or draw me nearer to His throne; Or bind Him closer to my heart. The desert-cave, the lonely dell, The wild ravine's dark, solemn shade, The mountain-summit too can tell How there He wander'd, watch'd, and pray'd. For those deep solitudes sublime His pillow and His altar were; In every season, every clime, His place of rest, His house of pray'r. (Such scenes of grandeur and of awe The pensive Hermit-prophet trod When he on Horeb heard and saw His guardian Angel sent by God.) The purple robe, the mocking crown, To anger ne'er His spirit moved; No traitor Judas met His frown, No faithless Peter stood reproved. From Him was never heard complaint In all His bitter trials here; No bonds could make His courage faint, No scourge could draw one human tear! When dawn'd Mount Calvary's dreadful day (His Cup of Misery running o'er) Though weak and weary on the way, His heavy Cross He meekly bore; Then while deep darkness veil'd the sun, And earth was rent and rocks were riven, Home to the High and Holy One The Man of Sorrows rose to Heaven! When all is dark beneath the skies, To heaven, O Pilgrim! lift thine eyes, And soon the cloud shall melt away In faith and hope's celestial ray. To Calvary's Mount thy spirit borne, Shall meekly, without murmuring, mourn, And say, with God's devoted Son, âMy Father's will, not mine, be done.â Art thou to cave and desert driven? Hast thou no refuge under heaven? No faithful friend to soothe or share Thy body's pain, thy heart's despair? In solitude the Saviour's head Was pillow'd in the meanest shed, And oft amid the howling blast His nights of prayer and watching pass'd. Dost thou for charity implore? Do men against thee shut the door? And is thy poverty pursued By mockery and reproaches rude? Cold, hunger, persecution, scorn, For Him reserved their sharpest thorn; Disown'd, dishonour'd, and denied The Man of Sorrows lived and died. Is love dissembling and untrue? Has friendship turn'd a traitor too? Were His betrayals less severeâ The kiss of Judas, Peter's tear? Or has the grave for ever closed On one in whom thy heart reposed? Say was not His a heavier doom When weeping o'er the leper's tomb? Has the arch-tempter sorely tried To lure thee from thy heavenly guide? Remember how from Him recoil'd That foul, false fiend, defied and foil'd! Is there a foe with whom has striven Thy angry spirit, unforgiven? To pity let thy heart incline, And be thy Lord's example thine. Has death aside thy curtain drawn? Are sense and motion all but gone? Does feebly play thy pulse its part? And faintly beat thy fluttering heart? Celestial hope and perfect peace Shall crown thy happy's soul's release, And Faith proclaim to mourners by How sweetly her disciples die. Jesus wept!â Did ever grief, In so bright a form appear? Ever find its sweet relief In so exquisite a tear? Ah! what sorrow did it speak, Rolling down the Saviour's cheek! âJesus wept!â From age to age This holiest of all holy tears Has flow'd through inspiration's page, And still shall flow for endless years, Till dawns that everlasting day When tears shall all be wiped away. Rock of ages! firm and sure, Of the Godhead Essence pure! Sun of Righteousness! to Thee I, adoring, bend my knee. Man of Sorrows! mock'd and slain; Holy Martyr! risen again; Lamb of God! to Thee I raise My imperfect song of praise. Elder Brother! Friend Divine! (For Thy Heavenly Father's mine,) But for Thy redeeming grace I ne'er should see that Father's face. Prince of Peace! whose reign began With bringing mercy down to man; Mighty Conqueror of the grave! Hear Thy servant, hear! and save. When early sunbeams gild the skies To Thy glory let me rise; And the day in passing through Ever keep Thy cross in view. Let me, with devotion fill'd, On Thee for my salvation build; Not, self-righteous, vainly trust In works which are but dross and dust. Me, good Shepherd! kindly lead, With Thy little flock to feed, That, in their communion sweet, I may worship at Thy feet. When from my uplifted eyes The day in sunset's glory dies Let my evening hymn to Thee Pardon'd and accepted be. When the starry lamps of night Fill the heavens with sparkling light, Of some happy, holy dream Let Thy mercy be the theme. If of my ungrateful heart I have given Thee only part, Pour within it love Divine, And make it ever, wholly Thine. Darker and darker grew the veil That night was spreading all around; Louder and louder blew the gale That toss'd upon the deep profound A ship which seem'd both wind and wave By some mysterious power to brave. How wistfully that gallant bark Did Jesus look upon! for there Were His disciples, (sacred ark!) As on a mountain He, in pray'r, Pleaded before His Father's throne For every sorrow but His own. Alas! for that imperill'd crew.â Is there no celestial charm The foaming surges to subdue, The windy tempest to disarm? See from the mountain, prompt to save, A Deliverer walks the wave! âIt is a spirit!â was their cry Of supernatural awe and dread, When they beheld, as from on high, A radiant Form the billows tread, Which, parting, rose their God to greet, Then broke in silence at His feet. â'Tis I, be not afraid.â The deep Was calm, no more the vessel heaved, But seem'd upon the waves to sleep As she the Heavenly Guest received, Salvation's Herald from afar Lighted by the evening star! Then every breeze the storm had stirr'd, And every billow He had trod, And every rock and mountain heard âIn truth Thou art the Son of God!â That o'er the trembling waters peal'd From lips by wonder now unseal'd. To us, as unto them of old, This gracious miracle is givenâ By faith we still His form behold, And hear His gentle voice from heavenâ By faith, like His disciples, too We smile at all the storm can do. His sheep well know their Shepherd's voice As on the ear it sweetly falls; O how the little flock rejoice Responsive to its sacred calls! And well His sheep the Shepherd knows, For they His watchful love and care From early morn, to evening's close, And during night's dark season, share. But there, alas! are wandering sheep Who never the Good Shepherd knew; Them does He in remembrance keep, And to His flock will gather too. And there shall be one heavenly fold, One heavenly Shepherd, Lord! in Thee; And they who this by faith behold, By sight, in happier worlds, shall see. Ready to halt!ââFor shame! for shame! Unfaithful pilgrim, is it so? In duty's path through flood and flame When Heaven's command is, âForward go!â The sun and moon, they never halt, The stars pursue their course sublime, The seasons never are at fault, And onward swiftly travels Time. No pause make ocean's ebb and flow, Nor streams that woodland banks embow'r; Nor changeful winds that, high or low, Lash the loud wave, or fan the flow'r. Nor rests the sovereign hand that keeps Creation's wondrous balance right, The Eye all-seeing never sleeps That watches o'er it, day or night. Not till redemption's work was done, And all fulfill'd the promise given, The Father saw His Only Son, As Prince of Peace, return to heaven. âReady to halt!â Those words recall, And âForward!â let thy motto be; And take for Him, the Lord of all! The rugged path He took for thee. Holy Spirit! to my heart Thy supernal peace impart, Sorrow's comforter and balm! Doubt dispel, disquiet calm. Of this darkness deep and drear My beclouded vision clear, And upon it light Divine, Holy Spirit! cause to shine. Dove celestial! on Thy wing These good gifts benignly bring, And let their mysterious pow'r Sanctify this solemn hour. Let my faltering tongue's petition, Let my broken heart's contrition (If they not unworthy prove,) Thy Divine compassion move. A sunset smile illumes the deep, The waves are still, the woodlands sleep, The sky with richest crimson glows, And heaven and earth are in repose. A sweet serenity I feel O'er my spirit softly steal; A sacred joy, of which no part This weary world hath, warm my heart. And beaming in the distance far I see a bright and glorious star, That clouds and darkness cannot hide, My path to light, my steps to guide. A seraph-voice the silence breaks, A harp unseen sweet music wakes, And every breath and every string This gracious promise seems to bring: âThe heart with pure devotion fired, The Holy Spirit (love-inspired!) To doubt, disquiet, never leaves; Since he who asks in faith, receives.â When the Jews did mock and try Him, With revilings raise the rod, âCrucify Him! Crucify Him!â Cried the peopleâ(Voice of God?) Vox populiâthat cry satanic! Vox populiâthat direful doom!â Vox Deiâtrembling Nature's panic! Darkness, tempest, opening tomb! Lives there in heaven a Son of Light, An Angel more supremely bright, A Spirit form'd of purer fire, Holier than the rest and higher, Nearest to the throne above, Deepest in the Saviour's love? That Angel is the chosen one By whom the Father to his Son Sent words of comfort from on high, When Calvary's day and hour drew nigh. Though now before the Lord of all Angelic hosts in worship fall, And golden harps and tuneful choirs His name with sacred song inspires, The anguish of that piercing cry, The look of that uplifted eye, And those sweet words of grace Divine (Entrusted to no lips but thine,) That gave the Saviour strength in pray'r The Mount to climb, the Cross to bear, Good Spirit! shall remember'd be Through all eternity by thee. When they scourged, and mock'd, and bound Him, And the blood upon His brow Flow'd from every thorn that crown'd Him, Christ His head did lowly bow; And this dying prayer to Heaven, Love from His compassion drewâ âLet them, Father, be forgiven, For they know not what they do.â When with wrath my spirit burning, I would wrong with wrong repay; Lord! to thy example turning, My resentment dies away. Ere for pardon I implore Thee, Must my foe forgiven be; Or shall I in vain before Thee Breathe my prayer and bend my knee. It is finished!â Nature darken'd, And the sun was in eclipse, As to these last words they hearken'd From the dying Saviour's lips. Death beheld his bondage broken, Satan his o'er fallen man, When the Son of God had spoken, And His reign of peace began. âIt is finished!â No exemption, Fellow-sinner, yours and mine Is the mystery of redemption, Promised by those lips Divine! They who seek it shall not lose it, If in faith sincerely sought; Woe to them who dare refuse it! Such a prize so dearly bought. To the Father and the Son, And the Holy Ghost, be given (The Eternal Three in One! The High Mystery of heaven!) All the glory, all the praise That hearts can feel, and voices raise. To the Fatherâfor He gave Life, and all that makes it dear; And His only son, to save Man from Satan's bondage here. To the Sonâfor He obey'd What the Father had ordain'd; With His blood the ransom paid, And our Paradise regain'd. To the Holy Ghostâthe Balm, The Comforter, to whom we owe That consoling, sacred calm That breathes upon us in our woe! To the Father and the Son, And the Holy Ghost, be given (The Eternal Three in One! The High Mystery of heaven!) All the glory, all the praise That hearts can feel, and voices raise. Him I'll trust although He slay me, Firm my faith shall still remain; Unbelief that would betray me, But assaults my soul in vain. Clouds and darkness me surrounding, Sorely tempted, troubled, tried, Father! in thy love abounding, In Thy goondess, I confide. Though from me Thy face be hidden, (Soon, ah, soon! its light restore;) In Thy mercy Thou hast chiddenâ Let me suffer and adore. Thee I ask not to exempt me From the sorrows sin must share, Knowing well Thou wilt not tempt me More, my God! than I can bear. When the wild waters o'er my head, Their loud and angry billows roll, Till faith and hope, in doubt and dread, Seem all but shipwreck'd, with my soul; Satan, no more thy service press; Stand not between my God and me; From this dark ocean of distress One, only One can set me free. How often hast thou to ensnare The sinking, struggling sinner striven, When on the rock of deep despair His little bark, like mine, was driven. And tempted, as thou tempt'st me now, The Lord of mercy to deny, And with thy seal upon his brow, The death of unbeliever die. Though the wild waters, tempest-toss'd, Redouble their mad rage and roar, I will not give up all for lost, But only trust in Heaven the more. The Power that hurl'd thee from on high, For thy rebellion, fallen slave! From these dark depths will hear my cry, And raise me, ransom'd, from the wave. Father! thus I still address Thee, When I kneel in pray'r and praise; By that name I learn'd to bless Thee In my childhood's happy days. And my Teacher was no other, When I said âThy will be done,â Than my Lord, Redeemer, Brother, And Thy everlasting Son. Let me think (the past recalling) What a Father Thou hast been; How my feet were kept from falling, As I past from scene to sceneâ Youth's temptations, bright, alluring! Manhood's trials, sharp and stern! Teaching lessons, by enduring, Well to know, but sad to learn! Life's rough path descending slowly, More than ever I have need Of Thy presence pure and holy Down that path my steps to lead. One beyond, in darkness shrouded, Still remains, and only one; Father! let Thy lamp unclouded Safely through it light Thy son. Saints in adoration bending At the footsteps of Thy Throne; Seraph-voices sweetly blending, With the harp's deep, solemn tone. The chain'd prophet from his prison; The pale martyr from his fire; Faith's true soldier, conqueror risen, Swelling the harmonious choir! Such a glorious host assembling, Great Jehovah! in Thy praise; Pardon if, with fear and trembling, I presume my voice to raise. Yet if reverence, awe, awake it, Have I not Thy promised word, They, with love, shall ever make it In Thy holy temple heard. Never may unseemly boldness Prompt me in Thy presence, Sire; Nor formality and coldness Quench my spirit's sacred fire. Freely with my soul's petition Let me seek the Mercy-seat, And with dutiful submission Lay it, Father, at Thy feet. Lord! before I turn'd to Thee, I was bound, but now I'm free; I was blind, but now I see. Full of sorrow, full of care, Wandering I knew not where, Deep and dark was my despair. Walking now with Thee in sight, Pleasant is my path and bright, And my spirit, O, how light! Nature's beauties, ever new, In another glass I view: Now I know their Maker too. Since my soul on Thee relied, Self-sufficiency and pride In one happy moment died. Open is my heart and free, Now (what Thou hast taught) I see, Love to man is love to Thee. Throned in majesty and might, In the storm thou com'st to-night, God omnipotent! most high! Filling nature with affright, Making tremble earth and sky! Peals of thunder, flood, and fire, Herald Thee, Eternal Sire! Moon and stars grow dim and pale, As in darkness they retire, At Thy voice, within the veil. 'Tis well the terrors of Thy word, In the loud tempest should be heard, To startle conscience and appal; That stubborn scorners might be stirr'd, And know Thou reignest Lord of all! While with awe we kneel before Thee, (We who live but to adore Thee!) Fill our hearts with holy things, And Thy mercy, we implore Thee, O, vouchsafe us, King of kings! Never look'd compassion sweeter (Too intense, alas! to chide), Than when Jesus turn'd to Peter, As he thrice his Lord deniedâ Peace and love From heaven above That expressive look implied. False Apostle! Spirit broken! Well mayst thou retire to weepâ He accepts thy tender token, Flowing from repentance deepâ Every tear (A treasure dear!) Christ will in remembrance keep. Thy hot zeal, and thy denial, Prove how weak the wisest are, To pass through a fiery trial Without mortal wound or scarâ Their strength, in need, A broken reed, And vain self-trust their ruling star. Musing o'er thy mournful story, Shall we not our faces hide, When, like thee, the Lord of Glory We so often have denied; Counting nought The truths He taughtâ And spurning gifts for which He died? Father of the fatherless! Husband of the widow! we, In this dark day of our distress, For consolation come to Thee. Yet, while we say, âThy will be done,â Forgive the fond, the filial tear We, broken-hearted, shed for one Whose loss has made us mourners here. To wipe the tear, to heal the smart In mercy dealt, is Thy employ; To bind the orphan's broken heart, And make the widow's sing for joy. Fountain of every earthly good, Whose providential care Has long my path with blessings strew'd, With mercies rich and rare, If what I feel my faltering tongue Could only truly speak, Thy praise should not be feebly sung; But, ah! my words are weak. They sink beneath the sacred theme, They poorly play their part, And but the faintest echoes seem Of what inspires my heart. Lord! for Thy refreshing rain Pour'd upon the growing grain, For Thy sun's warm, ripening rays, Hear a grateful people's praise! Fruitful harvests through the land Wait the joyful reaper's hand; Golden crops to Him who gave As in worship, seem to wave! With the plenty Thou hast spread None in vain shall ask for bread; At Thy table, God of grace! Rich and poor shall find a place. With the bread Thy bounty show'rs, O, let that of Life be ours! Food celestial, Father! give, That our souls may feed and live. Look down, in mercy, O! look down, Jehovah! from Thy throne in heaven. I cannot live beneath Thy frown, I dare not die if unforgiven. Now with faith, with doubt abiding, By contending passions cross'd, Hope and fear my thoughts dividing, I, by turns, am saved and lost. Vouchsafe some token of Thy grace, Some precious sign, and let me see My Heavenly Father's smiling face Reflect its glorious light on me. Christian brother! silent, sad, Pinch'd with hunger, poorly clad, Heavy laden, weary, worn, (Faith's hard trials meekly borne!) Let my willing arm, I pray, Bear your burden for to-day, My staff support your feeble form, My cloak protect it from the storm. Christian brother! I can spare Much of this my frugal fare; Freely of it, for His sake, Whom we serve and seek, partake. Christian brother! the same road Leads to my and your abode; The same Heavenly Father, too, Waits to welcome me and you. Christian brother! to our rest Forward be the journey press'd; All the troubles we endure Only make that rest more sure. Christian brother! never tire; As we toil through thorn and briar Let our hearts, serenely gay, Discourse sweet music by the way. Christian pilgrim! still pursue Thy upward path, with heaven in view; Linger not, but travel straight On to the celestial gate. Christian pilgrim! on the sky Full and firmly fix thine eye, For see already, crown'd with light, The holy city is in sight! Christian pilgrim! nearer still Rises Zion's heavenly hill; Hark! Hosannas! one step moreâ Now is life's rough journey o'er. Christian Pilgrim! joy and rest Are thy portion with the blest, Who, unto salvation wise, Of their high calling gain'd the prize. Christian soldier! to the field; Light thy armour, truth thy shield, Wage a holy war with sin, And immortal honours win. Christian soldier! Satan's horde, Make them feel the Spirit's sword, Deeper wounds than carnal steel Doth that heavenly weapon deal. Christian soldier! Unbelief (Of thy foes the first and chief) Let it at thy feet expire By that sword of living fire! Christian soldier! conqueror! rise, Thine's the triumph! thine the prize! Of sin and death no more the slave, Thy last victory's o'er the grave. Christian martyr! from thy cell, Bound in chains and guarded well, They have brought thee to expire For thy holy faith by fire. Christian martyr! fiendish cries Greet the flames that round thee rise, Every hand a faggot throws, And the furnace fiercer glows! Christian martyr! from the blaze Sweetly sounds thy song of praise; Well become those solemn pray'rs Thy calm brow and silvery hairs. Christian martyr! raised by thee That âunworthy handâ I see By thy sentence meet its doom, Scorch, and blacken, and consume! Christian martyr! to the sky Dost thou lift a longing eye? Soon above yon starry pole Jesus shall receive thy soul! Christian martyr! dying saint, Faltering grows thy voice and faint, And thy reverend form for aye In smoke and darkness fades away. On that dreadful day of doom When the trumpet, from the tomb Shall the buried nations all To the Redeemer's presence call, That their sentence they may know, Everlasting joy, or woe! Shall I be prepared to meet Jesus on His judgment seat? Angels round the King of kings Veil their faces with their wings, As the Book of Life He takes And the deep, solemn silence breaks; Bidding sit upon His right With the blessed sons of light Those who fought upon His side, And for His glory lived and died. Hark! 'tis the Judge's awful frown, That calls the rolling thunder down, And see the wicked stand aghast, To hear their final sentence pass'd; While hollow groans of deep despair, Echoing from the caverns where Hope comes never! tell the pains Of darkness, guilt, and fiery chains. Blessed are the dead that die In the Lord, for ever blest; From their labours they on high Soar to everlasting rest. Past are all their sufferings here, Sleepless nights and toilsome days; Wiped away is every tear, Sighs are turn'd to songs of praise. Can we wish them to return From their bright abode above, Here again to toil and mourn? No! for that would not be love. It is too late!â These words of woe, Of condemnation and despair, Has guilty conscience whisper'd low To the sinner hasteningâWhere? While mourners from the dying bed, Returning to absorbing cares, Forget how soon that whisper dread, That awful whisper, may be theirs! Time was when penitential tears Had open'd freely mercy's gate; But now the voice of careless years Tells them, in turn, âIt is too late!â While memory, haunted by the past, (The past, that nothing can repair!) In a dim death-dream fades at last, And darkness closes on despair. âIt is too late!â Come pain severe, Come the world's heaviest trials all, Rather than on my startled ear These words of woe should sternly fall! See the stately vessel steering, Hear her parting music, hear! As the crew on deck appearing, Give, responsive, cheer for cheer! To a far, benighted nation, Stranger to the Gospel's sound, With glad tidings of salvation, Bark of mercy! she is bound. Ah! what noble hearts within her Home and friends have left behind To convert the heathen sinner, To pour light upon the blind. Cheerfully their holy mission They pursue across the wave, To destroy dark superstition, Or to find a martyr's grave! Vast, majestic, mighty ocean! Spare that gallant vessel, spare! And those hearts of true devotion Safely on thy billows bear! They have borne in ample measure Guilt, oppression, dust, and dross, Now they bear earth's richest treasure, Pearl above all price!âthe Cross. Symbol of the Man of Sorrow! Far beyond the boundless sea Thou on some auspicious morrow Shalt in triumph planted be! Idol-gods shall fall before thee, Superstition fly the earth, Every nation shall adore thee, In her new, celestial birth. Child of heaven! though poor, neglected, Let not sorrow cast thee down; Was not Christ despised, rejected? Were not thorns His earthly crown? Dost thou mourn that of affliction Thine has proved so large a share? Think upon His crucifixion, Humbly bow, and learn to bear. Did He not for thy salvation Suffer all without complaint? And wilt thou, in pain, privation, His disciple! falter, faint? Soon from this thy earthly prison, Child of heaven! to weep no more, Thou shalt rise, as He has risen, If thou bear the cross He bore. Hark! the war-inspiring drum, See! the armed squadrons come Hurrying to the battle-field, Brother against brother steel'd, Burning to begin the strife, Blood for blood, and life for life! God of battles! let Thy Word At the cannon's mouth be heard. Prince of Peace! proclaim Thy rule, Bid the wrath of nations cool; Foes shall then in friendship meet, And tyrants tremble and retreat! Fruitful fields with harvests crown'd, Floral beauty smiling round, Busy hamlet, silent glen, Blest abodes of peaceful men! Homes so happy, hearts so brave Save from the despoiler, save! But if from some Divine decree, Unknown to all, great God! but Thee, New deeds of death must now be done, And future battles fought and won, Let justice make a speedy pause, And victory crown the righteous cause. I will love the Lord of light, I will serve Him day and night, All that gratitude can give I will render while I live. On a bed of sickness laid I implored His healing aid, And returning health declares How He hearken'd to my pray'rs. I was troubled, and my sigh, In my sorrow, was to die; But the Holy Spirit's breath Saved me from despair and death. What, for good so freely given, Shall I offer up to Heaven? O, for Jubal's hallow'd lyre! O, for David's lips of fire! Come, great Physician! from above, Come, with Thy healing powers, In pity, tenderness, and love, To this sad home of ours. And let Thy heavenly voice and hand A sufferer soothe and save, And Thy restoring angel stand Between her and the grave. Thou Who didst raise the widow's son, O, hear our fervent prayer, This dearly-loved, this valued one Spare, in Thy goodness, spare! Ah! think not that these sighs and tears Reproach Thy holy will; Though strong our too-foreboding fears, Our faith is stronger still. When, for some great mercy shown, I approach my Father's throne, In the fulness of my heart, Only tears, to thank Him, start. May I hope that tears will find Favour in the Heavenly Mind? âTears from penitence that flow, From grateful joy, from sacred woe, Well the want of words supply When the mood's too rapt, too high.â Thus a voice my spirit cheers When my thanks are only tears. Could they who bear the cross but know The bliss for them in store, How soon their tears would cease to flow, And they would sigh no more; Their burden would be bravely borne, With this assurance blest, That comfort comes to those that mourn, And to the weary rest. Away from the world I have wander'd afar, My lamp and my pilot was Bethlehem's Star, It lighted my path, and it pointed the road, And led me at last to my Saviour's abode. His Word and His Promise I've read and believed, His Grace and His Mercy I've ask'd and received, I've sought Him and found Him, I've knock'd, and I wait In faith and in love, till He open the gate. Lord! help me to cast off my burden of sin, Or ne'er at Thy portal may I enter in; Since none but the holy, the pure, and the blest Shall ever find place where the weary have rest. The Sabbath-day, to man by Heaven For rest and meditation given, Again (O, privilege Divine!) The Lord hath made in mercy mine. God of goodness! God of grace! Receive me in Thy dwelling-place; Be Thou, Eternal Spirit! there; Accept my praise and hear my prayer. O be my thoughts from earth as far As is from earth the morning star; Transfigured, and from bondage free, My Father! let them rise to Thee. With a grateful song of praise Sweetly doth the evening close Of another Sabbath-day's Sacred worship and repose. Day of rest from toil and care, Labour hath no claim on thee; Six are its appointed share, Thou, the holy seventh! art free. Though the sordid and profane Think thee made for them alone, Their assaults shall prove in vain, For the Lord will keep His own. For His service He design'd Man should have one day in seven; Leaving time and world behind For eternity and Heaven. Let us now, with one accord, For His goodness praise the Lord, For His loving-kindness raise Our united hymn of praise. Praise Him for the peaceful night, Praise Him for the morning light: For strength by gentle sleep restored, And social blessings, praise the Lord! Praise Him that with hearts sincere We meet again in worship here, Imploring, for His mercy's sake, A blessing on the bread we break. Praise Him that we live to say, âBe with us through this busy day, And, O, vouchsafe us, Lord, the while, The light of Thy approving smile.â Praise Him for the vast amount Of blessings that we cannot count; Give to God, of good the Giver, Present praise, and praise for ever! My harp is on the willows hung, Untuned and hush'd is every string; The song of joy I might have sung, A stranger here, I may not sing. A brighter, better world than this Its music only can inspire; Then, till arrive that promised bliss, Shall sadness silence every wire. ââAnd is there nought beneath the skies, To wake thy harp? See, pilgrim, see, (An inward monitor replies,) This vast creation made for theeâ âThe smiling morn, the noonday beam, And twilight's peaceful, pensive hour; The freshening breeze, the murmuring stream, And every fruit and every flower. âAnd are not social blessings thine, (The broken spirit's surest balm;) Endearing ties that fondly twine Around thy heart, to soothe and calm? âAnd faith, the soul's immortal prize! That death's dark sepulchre unbars? And hope, fair daughter of the skies! That lifts her head above the stars? âThen let thy harp once more be strung, Its strains to gratitude be given; Thy song of jubilation sung, That thou shalt sing with saints in heaven.â Mourner! when thy heart is bleeding, Think on this, and rest resign'd; Saints in heaven are interceding For the friends they left behind. Guardian spirits never sleeping, Ministering angels bright, Have thee in their holy keeping ('Tis their mission) day and night. Does a hand unseen protect thee? 'Tis a father's that defends; A mysterious voice direct thee? 'Tis a dear departed friend's. Does the evil tempter try thee, To thy soul's eternal loss? There's a tender mother nigh thee, Whispering, âJesus and His cross!â Struggling with the foaming billow, Wounded on the battle-plain, Art thou looking for a pillow With the shipwreck'd, or the slain? On the wings of duty flying, They the Master's will perform To the living and the dying, In the calm and in the storm. The Lord His word has always kept, And will it always keep; His providence has never slept, Nor will it ever sleep. The gracious promises of old He to our fathers will'd; From age to age their sons behold To them alike fulfill'd. Creation's universal voice Attests the Maker's truth, As sun and moon and stars rejoice In their primÃ¦val youth. They their appointed courses take In the celestial round, Nor once the beauteous order break In which they all are bound. In every season God is seen, His ministers they are Of bounty, and have ever been Since sang the Morning Star; True to the purpose of their birth, They realize His plan, Adorn and fertilize the earth His goodness made for man. The Prodigal his portion took, (His folly was to roam,) And parents, kindred, friends forsook, And his too happy home; To a far land away he went, With none his path to bless, And recklessly his riches spent In riot and excess. There came a dearthâgaunt famine spake! And in that season dire, Not having daily bread to break, He took a servant's hire. Sharp hunger pinch'd, till he was fain With swine their husks to share; Ah! then he thought of home again, And loving kindred there. Thus bow'd and humbled to the dust, And full of deep remorse, He put in Providence his trust, And homeward bent his course. The shelter of the meanest shed, The hind's severest task, A morsel of the coarsest bread, He'll only dare to ask. But ere the broken-hearted man Could his repentance speak, His father saw him, and he ran In haste to kiss his cheek! To greet the dead to life restored, The wanderer's steps to stay, And welcome to his festive board The contrite castaway. He bade his ready servants bring, For garments so unmeet, A robe of honour, and a ring, And sandals for his feet. And then the fatted calf was kill'd, The song and dance went round, And every heart, with gladness fill'd, Did hail the lost one found. And joy there shall be seen in heaven, Upon salvation's morn, O'er some poor penitent forgiven, Some sinner newly born. Oh, how passing sweet is prayer! The breath of Paradise is there! When, for what he daily needs, Man to his Creator pleads. When earth no longer hope can give, It bids him look to Heaven, and live; For an abundant entrance there Was never yet denied to prayer. When I ask some earthly blessing Of the gracious God of heaven, Am I sure 'tis worth possessing? Am I sure it will be given? But when daily I implore Him For a promised gift Divine, As, in faith, I kneel before Him, He, I know, will make it mine. Gifts of sense, as I might use them, God will grant me or deny; Merciful, if He refuse them; Bountiful, if He comply. What I ask in erring blindness Only His compassion moves: Gently, and with loving-kindness, By withholding, He reproves. The busy day has seen its close, With evening comes the heart's repose, For then my thoughts, so apt to roam, Return for rest and quiet home. With every sordid care dispell'd, With every evil passion quell'd, They charm away my saddest mood, Remembering only what is good. They bring from amaranthine bowers Garlands of Fancy's fairest flowers, And chaplets where in beauty blows, Beside the lily, Sharon's rose! From fairy-land comes Fiction dress'd In many a parti-colour'd vest, And Truth, from heaven, a vestal bright! In pure and radiant robes of light! They lead me to some classic stream Where bards of old were wont to dream, And bear me to the waters still That flow from Zion's heavenly hill. For suffering virtue's sorrows here, They draw my tributary tear, But when the cross I stand before, For human woe I weep no more! With this last solemn scene impress'd, My thoughts in peace retire to rest, Too happy if a morning dream Reflect them back, the sacred theme. Not only when in concert sweet The hymn of praise is heard, And Christians on the Sabbath meet, Be my devotion stirr'd; But let me through the busy day When tempted most and tried, Walk with my God, and humbly pray That He will be my guide. His holy presence is no bar To honest, right pursuits, But a Divine directing star To industry's fair fruits. For fraud, oppression, greed, and guile, He has a withering frown; But for integrity a smile That brings a blessing down. The ready hand, the willing heart, In duty's path be mine; And if I act the better part, The glory, Lord, be Thine. Happy the man whose path is laid Among the gentle, wise, and good; Whose virtues, nourish'd in the shade, Make a heaven of solitude. Whom neither Fortune's frown or smile Unduly can depress or raise; To whom a conscience void of guile, Approving, whispers honest praise. Foe to man, unsparing foe! Insidious source of all his woe, Ever watching souls to win, Satan's sleepless servant, Sin, Take whatever form thou wilt, Well I know thee, guile and guilt! When plays ingratitude its part, How hideous looks thy naked heart! In a dishonest thirst for gold, Thee, wicked tempter! I behold. When scornful pride inflicts a pang, The venom's thine, for thine's the fang! In falsehood's tale thy voice I hear; Thy smile is in the sceptic's sneer; When fiercely burns impure desire, 'Tis thy foul breath that fans the fire; And I, in disobedience, see Thy first, worst form to man and me. With the bread of life eternal Feed my flock when I am gone; By clear streams, through pastures vernal To fair Zion lead them on. They are in a land of strangers, Sorely tempted and oppress'd; In their path lie many dangers: This is not their place of rest. Be their Shepherd; watch them kindly; Guide the young; support the old; Bring the wanderer back who blindly, Led by folly, leaves the fold; Lest the wolf, in ambush lying For some lost one gone astray, Weary, faint, deserted, dying, Seize the unresisting prey. Take my crookâfor them I bore itâ And in no wise lay it down, 'Till I call thee to restore it, And receive thy heavenly crown. Sweet is praise when heart and voice In the King of Heaven rejoice, When their hallelujahs rise To His temple in the skies. With melody the stars of morn Hail'd creation newly born, And softly sang the seraphim The infant Saviour's advent hymn. The Psalmist tuned his lyre and lays To the great God of Jacob's praise, And Jubal's harp's harmonious strings Gave glory to the King of kings! In prison walls, on every cell Thanksgiving's sacred music fell, As, by the Holy Spirit fired Sang Paul and Silas, praise-inspired. And did not, with His cross in view, The Saviour and His faithful few, To their Heavenly Father raise An everlasting song of praise? When grateful hearts with praise o'erflow, 'Tis all but perfect bliss below; For what is perfect bliss above But endless praise and boundless love? What is man, that from His throne God should His frail creature own? And in mercy condescend Still to be His Heavenly Friend? Him in Paradise He placed, Undefiled and undefaced; Set upon his noble brow Godhead's seal!âWhat is he now? By despair's wild waters toss'd; But for the Rock of Ages, lost; Which shall his only refuge be From the dark depths of that dread sea! If he sink, no more to rise, By his own free will he diesâ Then grasp that Rock, look out for shore, And, sinner, rise to sink no more. If works alone can save the soul, And make it fit for heaven, What Pharisee shall reach the goal, Self-justified, forgiven? Yet still a holy life and pure The God of heaven commands; His sight will nothing less endure Than what His law demandsâ But, with obedience, we must bring (To reach the throne above) Its self-denial, and its spring, Humility and love. Love illumes the path of duty, Making all before it bright; As the sun's meridian beauty Gives to nature warmth and light To obey the Lord and fear Him Duty prompts; yet holier still Is the love that draws me near Him, Heart and soul, to do His will. Duty, like a faithful servant, Leads me to the Master's throne; Love, confiding, filial, fervent, Makes the Father all my own! May, united, love and duty In my bosom be enshrined, And reflect each other's beauty In the mirror of my mind. Guard me through distress and danger, Make the earthly race I ran, (A poor pilgrim and a stranger!) True to God and just to man. There is still a higher glory Than belongs to martial story: Soldiers are not heroes all, Though in battle-field they fall. There's a gallant battle fought In warring with a wicked thought; And a glorious victory gain'd In a besetting sin restrain'd. His shall be the conqueror's crown Who nothing cares for fortune's frown; Who nobly scorns to be her wooer, And has the courage to be poor! Behold that humble Christian there, Shall he no crown of glory wear? Yes! one for him remains in store Brighter than warrior ever wore! Pilgrim! to celestial bowers Does thy longing heart incline? Weary steps and watchful hours, Pain and sorrow, shall be thine. Holy martyrs (mournful days!) Suffer'd famine, sword, and fire, Ere triumphantly, in praise, They possess'd their soul's desire. Wouldst thou gather Sharon's Rose? Thee its beauty shall reward If thou seek'st it where it grows, In the garden of the Lord. Cast the sinful world aside, Give no evil passion room; Ne'er impurity and pride Breathed its fragrance, saw its bloom. Lively faith and perfect love (Lamps of an etherial fire, Sent to light thee from above!) Never falter, never tire.â They shall keep thy courage up, Through this dark and dreary waste, And make sweet the bitter cup Every pilgrim's born to taste. And (thy guardian angels still) They shall with thy spirit soar To its rest on Zion's hill, To wander, watch, and weep no more. The day's far spent, the night's at hand, And by the evening beam I see, beyond Time's narrow strand, Eternity's wide stream. Soon launch'd on its mysterious wave My fragile bark will be; Ah! what shall it from sinking save In crossing that dread sea? One bright and solitary Star Shoots forth its glorious ray, And, like a pilot, from afar Would seem to guide my way. That Star upon salvation's morn First in the heavens appear'd, And never bark sank, tempest-torn, That by its light was steer'd. The Hall of Memory! 'Tis a hall That Death has trod with solemn pace, And hung with many a funeral pall, And many a fond familiar face; And in its echoes I can hear (For Fancy haunts this loved retreat), Of kindred, and of friendship dear The well-known sound of voices sweet. One, early lost, is whispering low, âI thought it sad so soon to part; Yet longer life had been but woe, A blighted hope, a broken heart! âAnd never more the parting tear Would sorrow, for the dying shed, If they and I who slumber here Might tell what bliss awaits the dead.â Then breathes another gentle one! âLet me, ah! let me speak for all; Thy happiest day beneath the sun Shall wrap thee in thy funeral pall.â Think not, mourner, pain and sorrow Solely sent as sin's reward; But sweet consolation borrow From these chastenings of the Lord. Look upon affliction rather As a trial from above, Sent thee, by thy Heavenly Father, Not in anger, but in love. O! for that entire devotion To see His wisdom in His ways; O! for that Divine emotion To pour forth heart and soul in praise. For spiritual strength, in weakness; For purity, from sin to fly; For patience, to endure with meekness; For hope, to cheer us when we die. If careless, unreflecting man, Trembling upon the narrow brink Of vast eternity, a span! Would with his heart commune, and think How imperceptibly retreats His fleeting life with every breath, And how each fluttering pulse that beats Is but the muffled drum of death; Then would he learn to count the cost (Sad reckoning!) with a miser's care, Of precious moments idly lost, And find he has not one to spare; And, lest a moonless night should fall Upon his duties left undone, Arise, though late, at Wisdom's call, While yet 'tis day, and shines the sun. Satan! with dark doubts and fears You've assail'd my soul for years, Not one art to sin allied Have you, Tempter! left untried. You against what truth had taught Unbelief's artillery brought; Pour'd by you, its shot and shell On my faith's weak fortress fell. When you ask'd why much, by Heaven, Is to the unworthy given? And why should fall to virtue fair Of fortune's gifts so poor a share? Could you not the truth have told, That virtue is not paid in gold; Adding to it one truth more, That Heaven has better things in store? When you ask'd the question, why Man was only born to die? Why the answer fail to give? Born to die that he might live! You with rash, rebellious pride The great God of heaven defied, And 'twill your torment ever be The Christian's rest that heaven to see! Compensation's work is doing In the shade and in the sun; Justice is her course pursuing, Trying all and sparing none. Never varying, never veering, Shining forth with steady ray, Truth, the star by which she's steering, Lights her steps and leads the way! Justice is her course pursuing, And shall reign beneath the sky Till, to finish what is doing, She and Mercy meet on high. Not too anxious for to-morrow, Not too careless of to-day, Temperate in joy and sorrow, Not so often grave, as gay; By no evil passions driven; Envy, malice, bearing none; On unkindness unforgiven Never letting set the sun; Grateful for whatever blessing, In its bounty Heaven has sent; Ever happy in possessing Quiet, competence, content; Not, for pride, profusely giving; Not to Mammon meanly sold; Less for self, than others, living; Prizing friendship more than gold; Let me pass through life's probationâ And then let me, when I die, Full of hope and resignation, Give to earth my long, last sigh. While the blood is fast retreating Homeward to its trembling seat; While the last low pulse is beating, Ere it, Father! cease to beat, On the pillow of the dying Pour one bright and heavenly ray, Then, upon Thy grace relying, Shall the spirit pass away. Peace be with us!âHoping, fearing, Watching, weeping, are no moreâ In his gentlest form appearing Death proclaims the conflict o'er. Grave! in Jesus sweetly sleeping, Frail mortality is thine; Father! to Thy holy keeping Soars the ransom'd spark Divine! Poor and proud!âCan fancy, fiction, Show a greater contradiction?â Cloth of gold and linsey-woolsey Did we on some motley fool see, The ridiculous alliance Would bid gravity defiance. âYou surely are yourself beside To wear my robe,â says mocking Pride. Now what is Poverty's reply To Pride's sarcastic tongue and eye? âMost haughty Don, your taunts restrain, Up with your quizzing-glass again! Survey your robe, so stiff and fine, And then this modest cloak of mine, And own, upon a second view, It is for me to lecture you! The robe in which you vainly strut Is of a very common cut; It was not only made for you, But every brother upstart too! Its buckram will not let you bend To recognize an humble friend. In spite of all the airs you ape Out from it peeps the vulgar shape That marks you for the mushroom breed Of mounted beggars run to seed! My cloak, of quite another fashion, Keeps me from your cold compassion, 'Tis proof against the sharpest thorn Of patronizing, pitying scorn! From it recoil on fortune's fool His venom'd darts of ridicule, While frigid homage now and then It will enforce from better men. This cloak, in which I walk erect, Is not of pride, but self-respect. âMoney's the root of evil,â says The proverb of our school-boy days. But Money thus, in self-defence, From ancient saw appeals to sense. âOf evil, tell me, why the root? I bear both sweet and bitter fruit. As is the soil, behold in me The Olive, or the Upas tree. Imprison'd in the miser's hoard, His golden god to be ador'd! Or flying from the spendthrift's purse, What wonder if I prove a curse? By fraud or folly won or lost; The tool of him to whom I'm toss'd; Without a choice, without a will, A passive slave for good, or ill, As he in his pocket shakes me, I am only what he makes me.â Thou hast perform'd thy mission Like an obedient son; Having no condition Of Mammon left undone. Where'er was laid his golden snare, To thee, upon the prowl, The path seem'd straight, and light, and fair, Though crooked, dark, and foul! Never holy anchorite Press'd to his lips the cross With more devotional delight Than thou didst hug thy dross. Remorse did ne'er upbraid thee, Conscience held her breath, Nothing ever stay'd thee In thy course, but death! Thou, to the very letter, Hast Mammon's law obey'd; None ever served him better, None will be better paid. She never was her father's friend, She never kindly interposed His cause, in duty, to defend, But sat with lips in silence closed. She saw his cheek with flushes speak The anguish of a wounded heart; She coldly heard the wrongful word, But never took the rightful part. The sharpest thorn that can be borne She might have gently turn'd aside; And soften'd down the angry frown; But this her lukewarm love denied. From Reason's proud presuming page, And sophistry's false creed, I turn, with holy seer and sage, Creation's book to read. And while my dazzled eyes grow dim As they admiring gaze, God's works I worship not, but Him, And join with them in praise. The heavens declare His glory. They, And all beneath the sun, Earth and ocean, night and day No duty leave undone. The winds attentive silence keep, And not a wave is stirr'd; The thunder and the lightning sleep Till He has given the word. Obedient to His high behest Fall Spring's refreshing showers; And Summer comes by Flora dress'd, All fragrance and all flowers; Rich Autumn yields its golden grain, And barren Winter throws Its icy robe o'er earth again, And binds her in repose. The nightingale at evening sings Her song, to sadness given; The lark soars high on joyful wings With morning hymns to heaven. Of vast Creation every part Obeys its Maker's will,â Man! thou alone a rebel art; Wilt be a rebel still? TO THE COMET OF JULY, 1861. âOminous, mysterious stranger! Flaming fiercely from the skies, Art thou come to herald danger With a terrible surprise? Is thy mission one of ire? Jehovah's judgments, flood, or fire?â Such would have been in ages past, (Bound in Superstition's chain,) The cry of multitudes, aghast, Had they, from yonder starry plain, Beheld thee thus intensely glow On this our world of sin and woe. To us, in these enlightened days, Thou no herald art of danger; Still we behold thee with amaze, Unexpected, heavenly stranger! Through illimitable space Running thy eccentric race. For eternity thy history May afford a theme sublimeâ As thou cam'st, depart, a mystery, Never to be solved by time; Yet in thy coming we once more See cause to wonder and adore. THE SILENT HARP. Part I. Oh, for a gentle sleep! a pleasant dream To bear me to the mansions of the blest! O, but to bask one moment in the beam That circles the Saint's Everlasting Rest! Was my last prayer to heaven, when I my pillow press'd. And presently came over me a calm, A sweet forgetfulness of earthly things, As if I had imbibed some soothing balm, Some balm celestial such as angel brings, The Messenger of Peace with healing on his wings. And I beheld a solitary star In the cerulean firmament, that led The Magi, from their orient hills afar, To Bethlehem's thrice hallow'd, humble shed, At the Messiah's feet their royal gifts to spread. Methought, dissolved in this delightful dream, The fragrant breath of Sharon's Rose I drew; That, water'd by fair Zion's crystal stream, Of Palestine the golden Lily's hue The Garden of the Lord unfolded to my view. Nor heat nor cold were there, nor sun nor moon, Nor morning star nor evening, day or night; But in the blaze of an eternal noon Walk'd forth in majesty the Sons of Light, Their crowns of glittering gold, their robes of purest white. And then I listen'd to the thunder's roar, And saw the mountains shake, and, opening wide, The graves their pale, affrighted dead restore; The blood-red sun Cimmerian darkness hide, And the veil rent in twain when the Redeemer died! No tongue can tell the agony I felt, The awe sublime that o'er my spirit came As I before Salvation's Symbol knelt, And silently adored His Holy Nameâ For reverence seal'd my lips, and tremors shook my frame. Encircled by a rainbow rose a seat On which sat One before whom myriads bow'd; Lamps of bright incense burning at His feet, While joyful hallelujahs peal'd aloud From the angelic hosts, of witnesses a cloud. So glorious was the vision, so august; So thrilling its solemnity and sound; Could I look on and live? Poor sinful dust! My senses all were paralysed, and drown'd In a bewildering trance, dark, death-like, and profound. âO, for a gentle sleep! a pleasant dream To bear me to the mansions of the blest!â A spirit whisper'd, âWas your wish supreme, Your fervent prayer when you retired to restâ You've seen a glimpse of heaven, a shadowy glimpse at best. âBut ere the birds awake you with their songs, And the bright morning star begins to pale, Another vision which to earth belongs, To sin reproved and pardon'd, woe and wail, Shall meet your startled gaze.âBehold! I lift the veil.â Part II. A new enchantment wakes my wonder now! I see, as in a magic mirror clear, A pictured Image with its heavenly brow, A tuneful harp, to memory ever dear, My cherish'd household gods for many a happy year. Mournful remembrances of trials past! What would ye? The dark, desolating day Of anguish that I look'd upon ye last Has left me not a sigh or tear to pay. My homeless heart is dead, or only lives to pray! What supernatural, mysterious power Gives life and motion to that Image there? Like a vex'd spirit at the midnight hour From yonder tapestried wall it treads the air, Its hands devoutly cross'd, its pale lips whispering prayer. Slowly and solemnly it steals along To touch those silent harp-strings. Will they speak In some sad melody, some sacred song? Hark! their response is an unearthly shriek, Which makes more deadly wan that pallid, spectral cheek! And now I hear a hollow, stifled groan Burst through the hot and suffocating air, Such as belongs to broken hearts alone, And see the tears of passionate despair Flow from the streaming eyes of that frail Image fair. Such bitter sobs ne'er fell on mortal ears Since Mary knelt in penitence and prayer, And wash'd the feet of Jesus with her tears, And kiss'd, and wiped them with her golden hairâ Jesus, who came in peace to pity and to spare! When suddenly a light ethereal shone, And their high Sanctus Seraphim did sing, âGlory to Him who sits upon the throne?â And see, transfigured, with an angel's wing That Image robed in white, a pure, a holy thing! âI know that my Redeemer liveth! Yes! And that His Cross I have not borne in vain.â This was her song of triumphânothing less Awoke her silent harp, and voice againâ The glorious Lamb of God for poor lost sinners slain! And now the music ceased, the vision closed; And village bells to hail the Sabbath peal'dâ I left my pillow with a mind composed, Assured my dream some sacred truth conceal'd, Before the Throne of Light one day to be reveal'd. THE EXILE. The Exile, from his rock, looks o'er With wistful eye the boundless deep, Which parts him from that distant shore, His early homeâand looks to weep! O! but to see that home once more, And in its bosom die, and sleep. The weary Pilgrim who has striven With perils on the land and sea, Sighs for the harbour (tempest-driven) That shall his rest and refuge beâ Then let me, Father! be forgiven, For longing after Heaven and Thee.
