      <field name="fulltext">THE GIAOUR. A SATIRE. ADDRESSED TO LORD BYRON. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD BYRON. Who buys with gold what may be had for nought? Make thyself scarce, Giaour! if thou wouldst be sought. But why complain that brother coxcombs bore âI hold in utter abhorrence any contact with the travelling English. I was persecuted by these tourists even to my riding-ground at Lido, and reduced to the most disagreeable circuits to avoid them. I repeatedly refused to be introduced to them. Of a thousand such presentations, I accepted two. Hundreds who bored me with letters, or visits, I refused to have any communication with.â âAppendix to the Doge of Venice. The travell'd Bard, as never Bard before? For, while thou triest thy blushing state to hide, How proud thou art, if vanity is pride! I never meanly dunn'd thy awful door, And, once insulted, sought an insult more. Why should I seek what every stall can shew me? All who have seen the Giaour in Vathek, know thee; âThe Indian sung in a style altogether extravagant; related stories, at which he laughed immoderately, &amp;c.â See in âVathekâ the description of the Giaour, or short and squab Indian, who, when he rolled down the palace steps, drew all Samarah after him. Let thousands for a peep at Beppo sigh; If Lady Giaour don't like thee, why should I? This is a feeble attempt to imitate the great poetical âLuminary of the Age,â who never fails to discover the bright traits in the characters of his friends, excelling all writers in the first qualification of a Satiristâpersonality. The organ of this instinct in the great poet will doubtless be pointed out, if Messrs. Gall and Spurzheim, or their disciples, should ever have an opportunity of examining the skull of Lara; and who knows but it may one day become a vendible commodity in the hands of some Venetian, or other foreign merchant? Yet Giaour-adorers deem thee half divine, Not petulant, not envious, not malign, Not the Great Khan of folly's restless tribes, And not the most verbose of mortal scribes; No recreant, from thy duties far away, While Fate turns pale in England's evil day; No fustian-monger, ranting for a name, While fashion's sages call their gabble fame; No egotistâbear witness all thy volumes, And th' high âaward of Gods, and men, and columns;â But wittyâthough we slumber o'er thy page; Heroicâin the peevishness of rage; Of vast invention in stale repetition, Above thy rankâa scribbler of condition; The âprince of poets,â to thy vassals dear, For dead and living pay thee tribute here; A second Gamaâfor thou plow'st the wave, And, in lampooning women, greatly brave. SayâPatriot, rarely absent from the House! Thou most magnanimously scurrilous! Thou dread of Wordsworth's Ass, and Cottle's Muse! Thou scourge of ladies' maids, and Scotch Reviews! Thou proof that bronze, even Lara's, must decay! Thou meekest of th' immortals of to-day!â Has Simon Faultless found a thing in thee Simon the Faultless is a personification of that Monthly Review, which alone, of all human works, is infallible. Whose bray informs us what is poetry? Lord! what a leap from Venice to Blackfriars, To be the hack of hacks, the lie of liars, And puffer to the Fiddlefaddleation- Club, for suppressing genius in the nation! Poetry isâwhat half thy verse is not; It isâlet Lear or Montfort tell thee what. True poetry exalts and dignifies While it delights; it lifts us tow'rds the skies On wings eternal. If whate'er we see That charms and elevates, is poetry, Whate'er creates, or is, or may controul High passion in the subjugated soulâ Yet passion differs in the slave and hero; A mangled fly was poetry to Nero; To thy Cabal 'tis poetry to grin The Cabal here alluded to, is that of the âgreat poet,â and âhis set.â Is it to be believed, that about half a dozen individuals, in the nineteenth century, imagine they can depreciate Shakspeare and Milton, by praising Popeâand themselves? At envied excellence, like death and sin, Blighting with loathsome slime the Muses' bowers, As caterpillars stink, though fed on flowers. A snuff-box is poetic to a dandy, To Simon, and his babies, sugarcandy. Still must we listen to the vain debate See the Byron and Bowles controversy. On âNature versus Byron's envious hate?â Must I, too, take the âMighty Mother'sâ part, And fear for Nature, lest she quail to Art? What means this war of words about a word? âArt victor over Nature!â most absurd, If Art is Nature, as her voice declares! For what is Nature but God's works and theirs? Nature is substance, suffering, action, power; The rose is Nature, and the flying flower That hovers o'er it on resplendent wing; The beaver's cellar'd home; the viper's sting; The Angel's plume, the Angel's mind of light; The shadow of the brow that makes the night; The Seraph's oral song; the burning wire With which th' Eternal strings his azure lyre; Man, and the worm: the palace, and the shed; Life, and the shroud that moulders with the dead; Death, and th' embodied thought that cannot die. The bust, which âpresupposes poetry,â Is Nature's triumph; for, ere Art began, She triumph'd in the future ArtistâMan; And all we see on earth of great and good, Is but the bloom unfolding from the bud, Until, at last, great Nature's full-blown flower Shall be transplanted to a fairer bower. We labour with the bee, and with the ant, Impell'd, like them, by some controuling want, Call'd by whatever name, thirst, hunger, spite, Fear, hope, love, envy; passion, appetite. Say, while the hen-bird builds beneath the furze, Is human Art less natural than hers? If in a bird's nest Nature's skill is fine, In Wentworth's palace see that skill divine; For speaking hues, with breathing marble, share Th' immortal soul of inspiration there; Impress the Mind of Ages through the eye, And say to Death, âWhere is thy victory?â But Wentworth's pomp is Art. I grant it true; And, âlearned Theban!â Art is Nature too. Man spreads his daring canvass to the gale; But Nature made the hand that form'd the sail; Even as she taught the spider to supply The web that varies with the varying sky, To change adapting, in each alter'd plan, Means, that might teach humility to man. But what shall teach humility to thee, While Dennis bows to Baal the sapient knee, A comparison, by which Dennis would be insulted, would offend beyond forgiveness some moderns of his now-worse-than-useless professionâour great trading critics. And, âin a high wind,â snouted prophets trace âIf pigs in a high windâ see it, they may see farther than we are aware of, and anticipate for the great poet, or rather with him, âthe award of Gods, and men, and columns.â âThe mind, the music breathing in his face?â But if Apollo fancies he can see Some bastard of his own, incog, in thee; If Mars beholds in Vulcan grace divine And demi-god Alcides envies thine; This is an imitation of the following magnanimous lines of the Childe:ââTill she herself, by teaching, learn'd to spell.â Sketch from Private Life.âAnd pay for poems, when they pay for shoes.â English Bards and Scotch Reviewers. Well may sly rogues discover in thy stare The âstill-all-Greekâ and glorious Belvedere, The Apollo, once called of the Belvedere, in the Vatican. And Painting bend in rapture o'er thy phiz, So fit for sculpture, if the devil is! Milton has given to his Satan an exterior of god-like grandeur and beauty. But woe to Britain! what shall Britain do, Should'st thou, high Giaour, be still to wisdom true, And, struck by envious death's unerring hand, Deny thy ashes to thy native land? âI left England in 1816, with no very violent intentions of troubling that country again.â âLord Byron's Letter to the Rev. W. L. Bowles. âthe cold, and cloudy clime, Where I was born, but where I would not die.â Dedication to the Vision of Dante. What pangs for dues retrench'd will seize the vicar! While sexton hangs himself, retrench'd in liquor! And Humdrum, Tinsel, Skimm'd-milk, Swipes, and Co., Sob for thy carcase to adorn the row! Go, thenâthough Whitbread's shadow, fading dun, In Brougham seems fain to take the road and run;â Go, thenâthough less than half a Fox remains In Holland, Grey, Burdett, and âall the brains;ââ Goâfor what need can England have of thee?â Infect the flowers of odour'd Italy, Then, rot where Brenta sleeps! and to thy tomb Not even a dog, a British dog, shall come, A soft inscription of thy shade to beg; With diuretic pathos, lift a leg O'er Boatswain's Bard; or call his loving mate To ponder with him on a Jason's fate; Flap, with funereal ears, the woeful gale, And hang abaft her tar-lamenting tail! This attempt to put the âgreat Poet'sâ precepts into practice is a lamentable failure; for terms of seamanship, that might be very poetical in the mouth of Childe Noah, or other great voyagers, are quite otherwise, when used by a person who has only crossed the sea occasionally, like Scott, Moore, and Southey. âIn what,â asks Lord Byron, âdoes the infinite superiority of âFalconer's Shipwreckâ over all other shipwrecks consist? In the admirable application of the terms of his art. These very terms, by his application, make the strength and reality of his poem.â The genius of the poet-sailor, and his fate, make the poetry of his poem; and the application of the terms of his art constitutes its great blemish. Thou vain, malignant Instinct! Thou Enigma And Contradiction! Britain's boast, and stigma! Thou passing rich in soul, with none at all, The king of copyists, yet original! Thou Lord of Pindus, with no rival shared, Without imagination, yet a Bard! SayâLast of Minstrels, and become the first, As weeds thrive fast, and fastest far the worst!â Would'st hear a secret? Tell thy heart of lead, We do without thee living, and may dead. But let not Man, the erring Censor, frown On him whose race misfortune hunteth down, Born to reproach, instructed still too late, Their love more fatal than a demon's hate, Their wisdom vain! a woe-devoted line, Like those of old deplored in lays divine. Insect and Satirist! did God to thee Impart a ray of that divinity Whence burn the universal suns of space, And glows the soul in every seraph's face, To light thee in the darkness of thy deeds, And aid the blow from which a brother bleeds? Reprove, if thou art sinless, child of earth! But, danger-nursed, and sightless from thy birth, Judge not thy brethren! for their sire is thine; And âVengeance,â saith the God of all, âis mine.â What then? while meekness tolerates the vain, Shall we praise vice, because it leads to pain? What! while he mangles with the fang of hate, Misfortune in the tomb, if good and great, And from th' anatomy of buried hearts, And Nature's mute reproach, nor shrinks, nor starts, But stoops, from virtue's lifeless lip to tear The lingering smile, and leave his venom there; What! is there none in generous Britain born, To lash th' Inquisitor of Death with scorn? Yes! though the weak admire, the worthless praise The all-observed of these degenerate days; Notorious led-ass of the envy-led! Assassin of the memory of the dead! In whining, sneering, snarling, unexcell'd; Repelling sympathy, by love repell'd! Shy man of rhyme, from poesy aloof! Pug of the Macaronis! thou sad proof That creatures, form'd by Nature in a pet, Sans soul, sans body, may be something yet! Thou shalt not strew, and dare to look behind, The dust of Cowper on the pitying wind. Though keen the cold fang with which meanness tears The helpless heart that fiery malice spares; Though brother death-hounds deem the deed divine, On the publication of the âTask,â Simon Faultless, and Co. declared that Cowper had some merit. But since the Giaour volunteered his services, the âcreatures are at their dirty work again.â âWhy yet he doth deny his prisoners.â Thus the assassins of Kirk White stab his very ashes. (A deed not shamed by deed of theirs or thine;) The dead shall find a voice, the grave a tongue, The asp that stings the lifeless shall be stung, And, wringing hearts, shall find his own heart wrung. Pity consistency should be disgrace! And 't would be hard to shame a spotless race. Critics, thou say'st, are sometimes ready-made; Then what thou art by instinct, be by trade. Let future Cowpers bless a brother's love; Go, teach even faultless Simon to improve. Go, claim the honours of a garreteer, And darkly stab, and safely snarl and sneer: Write in the Monthly, with due spleen and hate: Men may be vile, yet not degenerate. But he, who says that âCowper is no poet,â Must be a wit, and have the wit to shew it. âCowper is no poet. He attempted the most atrocious of crimes in the Christian Codeâsuicide: and why? because he was to be examined whether he was fit for an office which he seems to wish to have made a sinecure. His connexion with Mrs. Unwin was pure enough, for the old lady was devote, and he was deranged. Cowper was the most bigoted and despondent sectary that ever anticipated damnation to himself or others. Cowper was the almoner of Mrs. Throgmorton.â âLord Byron's Letter to the Rev. W. L. Bowles. Born to the inheritance of a splendid fortune, Lord Byron may have vast ideas of the difference between the giver and the receiver; but for this cold-blooded insult on the buried âalmoner of Mrs. Throgmorton,â he deserves to experience what poverty and dependance are. âPope and Cowper,â says his Lordship, âcome into comparison in one great work.â Now, âthese two writersâ do not come into comparison âin the translation of Homer;â for it is as absurd to compare a poem in rhyme with a poem in blank verse, as it would be to compare the âtool-workâ of Lord Byron with the inspiration of Shakspeare. âI have tried,â it is Lord Byron that speaks, âto read Cowper's version (of Homer), and found it impossible. Has any human reader ever succeeded?â Whether Cowper is, or is not a poet, he does not make Achilles perjure himself, and Homer did not. âBut be themselves my witnesses, before The blessed Gods, before mankind, before The ruthless king, should want of me be felt To save the fleet from inroadâOh, his thoughts Are madness all! Cowper's Homer, Book I. Here is a turn worthy of Shakspeare. Let us see how the Parodist of the Lutrin has managed itââBut witness, Heralds, and proclaim my vow, Witness to Gods above, and men below! But first, and loudest, to your Prince declare, That lawless tyrant whose commands you bear, Unmoved as Death Achilles shall remain, Though prostrate Greece should bleed at every vein!â Pope's Homer, Book I. One would think the circumstances under which Cowper wrote his translation might have disarmed the malice of a fiend. Written, as it was, in the intervals of madness, to amuse the torturing leisure of the mind's decrepitude, to soothe the aching nerves and throbbing heart of a wretched invalid, where is the wonder, if Cowper's translation be inferior to Pope's, which was composed in the strength and maturity of the author's genius? Yet the work of Pope is not distinguishable from that of his assistants, Broome and Fenton. When retrospection, in thought's lonest hour, Recalls a spirit of transcending power, Who pass'd unstain'd to Heaven, though wretched here, We write the name of Cowper with a tear. And, if aught mournful could in Heaven have place, There would his soul, methinks, retain a trace Of pangs beyond endurance, yet endured Till the nerves snapp'd, and torture stood assured By speechless death, that his long task was o'er. Methinks the natives of that happy shore Would mark the stranger's aspect of distress, And know him by his heav'nly pensiveness. His soul, with strings too exquisitely fine For earth's rude touch, had deeper tones than thine, And more excelling compass. With the dead He warr'd not, nor on woman; and the head Of the defenceless worm fear'd not his heel. How unlike him âwho tortures all who feel,â Whom Gifford lauds, whom tourists flock to see, If this Censor do not pause in his ethics, what will become of the parsons? They will have nothing in the world left to do, but to pray that the devil may fly away with Gifford. Who spoils bad prose, and sneers at Calvary! Oh, how unlike the âthe wonder of the age,â The dramatist, who writes not for the stage, But froths, and foams, to supersede small beer! Quits wife and child to realize a tear! And pours his breaking heart in many a ditty, But never breaks his heartâthe more the pity! While virgins read thy well-depicted woes, And fast the angel-tear of beauty flows, Tell meâthou whimperer! who, by day, by night, Hast nought to do but whine, and read, and write! Giant of sorrows, with the languish'd head, Hung'ring for pity, as the poor for bread! Hast thou not oft a solemn picture seen, I'th' âTale o'th' Tub,â penn'd well by Patrick's Dean, Of mad Jack Calvin, courting kicks and blows, And persecution's tweaks o'th' holy nose? âHe would stand in the turning of a street; and calling to those who passed by, would cry to one, âWorthy sir, do me the honour of a good slap in the chaps;â to another, âHonest friend, pray favour me with a handsome kick on the ?. Madam, shall I entreat a small box on the ear from your ladyship's fair hand? Noble captain, lend a reasonable thwack for the love of God, with that cane of yours, over these poor shoulders.â âTale of a Tub. A suffering saint, he bared his breech, and smiled; So sufferest thou, from comfort self-exiled. Doleful, thou sail'st to every famous shore, âYet once more on the waters, yet once more;â If not the Jason of each gallant Argo, At least the rival of her supercargo. Lord Byron never loses an opportunity of expressing his contempt of lubbers. Indeed, his merit as a âVoyagerâ could hardly have been greater, had he actually served an apprenticeship on board a Grimsby Packet. âScott, Southey, Moore,â (Lord bless us!) âon the sea Have dared to sail;â but not for fame, like thee. Ladies of pleasure, sometimes call'd of pain, Knights of the thimble, too, have cross'd the main, And laugh'd at Lubbers; but thou sail'st so far, That all thy ink-shed hath a smack of tar. Nay, âthou hast swum more leagues, than Wordsworth, Bowles, And Coleridge dare sail,â for half their souls; âI have swam,â says Lord Byron, âmore miles than all the rest of them ever sailed! and have lived for months and months on shipboard!! and during the whole period of my life abroad have scarcely ever passed a month out of sight of the ocean!!! besides being brought up from two years till ten on the brink of it!!!!â Why, this is a greater personage than Sindbad himself!!!!! And, should'st thou swim for glory once again, He has celebrated his âperilous featâ in prefaces and in notes, in prose and in verse, in pamphlets, poems, and plays. Thou wilt not fail to tell us where and when. Hail, Cain of Thule, billow-climbing Cain; Thee letter'd Lubbers emulate in vain; Thy tale is truth, theirs brain-created lies: And wise is he (though fanciless, yet wise,) Who seeks, as Harold sought, each alien strand, Nor vainly seeks each far and famous land, But notes the âUnco's,â rhymes and prints his notes, And sells the book that every ribald quotes. All praise thy namesake; every drab admires The high-born bastard, with the many sires, Nosed like Schedoni, nosed like Harold, too, Yet, unlike thee, both passionate and true. No wife had he, or one who left her lord; He woo'd, and won, nor paid for bed or board: And things he saw, that might a stoic shock From sense and life; the spectre of a smock, Thrown o'er the moon's horns, like his Love's symar; A beard, âthat curl'd with rage;â andâstranger farâ A lady, bagg'd, as sportsmen bag their game, And drown'd for love, as Harold swam for fame. âOf common height,â that is, not very tall, Taking all characters, and suiting all, Unrivall'd robber, vagabond, and lord, Behold the Corsair, hated and adored! To none, save giant killing Jack, yields he! Matchless in valour, as in courtesy. 'Tis strange, but true! in battle's hour most grim, A swooning lady fell in love with him! Now, what can woman, if romantic, do, But fondly prove the Roman maxim true? And sheâthough woman, more than man in sinâ Was the just model of a heroine. Bless'd with a heart to feel for other's woe, She kill'd her lordâof course to save his foe. But, ah, her loved one had a wife already, As âunto that fair she right soothlyâ said he! And soâof curtain-lectures much afraid, He took Gulnare to be his Lady's maid. But when he reach'd his sea-surrounded bower, A hand of ice had pluck'd his snowy flower! And, therefore, he and heroine, both in breeches, âMade themselvesâair;â and, vanishing like witches, Took each an alias from that fatal day! Thus ends the story? would to Heaven it may! Don Giaour! I read thy sundry names perplex'd; By what new title shall we know thee next? Thy glorious writings, penn'd for fame, not pelf, Seem all dark transcripts of thy gloomy self. One, and yet many! single, yet a host! Tell me the secretâtell me, for thou know'stâ Is Lara Conrad? Critics say he is, Presuming on coincidence of phiz. He cameâbut whence? who knows whence came the sinner? âDropp'd from the moon? and once the queer man in her?â I know notâlet high Lara answer that; He came, however, in a black plumed hat; And with him cameânow, Doubt, suppress bad thoughts! A sort of lad, but not in petticoats; Kaled his name in English; what in Dutch Is dubious, and it does not matter much. Then came and went a Knight, but why, or how, Or whence, or where, the learn'd seem not to know. âFair falls the warrior,â on the crimson'd plain, âAnd death becomes him well,â in battle slain! Thus Lara fought and fell, with wounds gash'd o'er: Now God be thank'd! and may he rise no more! Last scene of allâBy grief transmogrified, Kaled, the boy, âbecame a girl, and died!â Heavens! what an incident! it almost throttles The gasping reader, and might make the Cottle's Leap into th' Severn, never more to cry, âFresh fish from Helicon! who 'll buy? who 'll buy?â More Giaours? more Corsairs? what! and more to come? Lords! can one thread stretch out âto th' crack of doom?â How like thy heroes are to one another! Selim is Harold's, Conrad's younger brother; Juan is Lara, in his morning hour; And conjuring Manfred is Childe, Corsair, Giaour. What long-ear'd son of glorious Tweedle-dee, In boundless sameness shall contend with thee? What infinite monotony is thine! Write what thou may'st, 'tis Giaour in every line. Another, and another, yet the same! Still chickweed, nicknamed cuckoo-pint, for fame? Nay, be a nuisance-monger of some mettle; Vary thy weeds a little, and plant nettle! Is there no hated purity to lash? No merit, struggling without friends, to quash? No helpless woe, no woman to abuse? No envied bard, no parson, to accuse? Childe! Giaour! and Corsair!ânames by which men call Bad copies of a worse original! Leviathan of scribblers! how the fry Of critic-minnows dread thy lordly eye, And clap their fins, and tremble, while they hail The bungling thunder of thy brandish'd tail; Even as our fathers worshipp'd on his throne The crabb'd superlative of bulk and bone, See the Works of the âColossus,â Dr. Samuel Surface, inventor of the Bow-Wow prose couplets, at once inimitable by human genius, and the vehicle of every modern scribbler's thoughts. âIf,â observes Lord Byron, âthe opinions cited, of the Doctor against Pope, are to be taken as decisive authority, what becomes of the poetical character of Milton, and of English Poetry in general? Still,â he sagely continues, âthe Doctor's is the finest critical work extant.â Bravo, Ethics! this is profundity. But, âin these days, the grand âprimum mobileâ of England is cant; cant political, cant poetical, cant religious, (cant Byronian?) and cant critical; but always cant.â âLord Byron's Letter to the Rev. W. L. Bowles. Who wrote in prose Pope's couplet, with huge grace Translating into fustian common-place! Two living wonders hath this wondering age, A monster-monger, and star-gazing sage: Thyself, who printest, with dilated stature, Thy new-invented, patent human nature, Like nought (thank God!) on earth, in air, or sea, Unlike what is, or was, not even like thee; And Phillips, Newton's ape, who loads poor Byron With packs of praise, as if his back were iron. When inspiration spoke in Balaam's ass, An ass's words âwere things that came to pass;â And Lara's fame, though dying, shall not die, If Dicky's bray of praise is prophecy; Great water-caster, Dicky, watery power! But greater even than Dicky is the Giaour! For thouâa mighty name in trifling timesâ Hast rear'd a sort of sign-post on thy rhymes, Which shall be read, when Dicky is forgotten, And even my stoolâthe poet's throneâis rotten; Unless some Bard, well worth his spleen and thine, Should make two grubs immortal in a line. Yet, Giaour, that author is a growing curse, Who, writing ill at first, writes daily worse. Seyd, the old Pacha, was a maudlin Turk; But what is Juan? patchwork, elbow work. A libel on Scotch drink, flat, stale, and poor, Diluted Smollet, and small beer of Moore: Behold the âhero!âânot, alas! âa new one!â Count Fathom and Zeluco in Don Juan! Then came thy dramaâwould thou'dst still delay'd it! For some, who read it, ask what tailor made it? Strange question! if thy wheelwright rudely wrought, With dull mechanic heaviness of thought, The long-withheld opprobrium of the day, The clumsy, lumbering waggon of a play, That Doge of Venice, not in Venice undone, But laugh'd at, pitied, worse than damn'd, in London. Ah, if thy lays than Bloomfield's lays are nobler, And unlike Byron's had he been a cobbler, Thou may'st not write as Shakspeare wrote, though Scott may; Butâif thou canstâmend; and be half an Otway. Then shall the Lakists weep thy triumph won, Kick'd by the titled ass of Helicon; And Jeffrey, great Discoverer of the Known, Shall bid stern Milton bow to thee alone; Jeffrey, wha kens the big mon best can write, But does na' ken that booing 's second sight; For a Treatise on the Art of âBooing to a Big Mon,â apply to Sir Pertinax Mac Sycophant. The imputation cast on modern Poetry is true of modern Criticism, which might, indeed, with the strictest propriety, be called âechoism.â No author, who is not a Lord or a Baronet, need expect to be noticed by our leading Reviews, unless he have established a reputation which renders their notice at once useless and ridiculous. But every Sir Sycophant Mac Syllable comes forward with his cowardly praise, when he can only tell the world what the world knows. Jeffrey, the âwee gray de'il,â who, with no small fuss, In fifty volumes wrote the one of Malthus. But Time decides on Bards and prophecies. Is this thy Drama of the Unities? For this shall ages guard thy chisel'd bust? Oh, what a fall is hereâfrom smoke to dust! From Juan to the Doge! Didst thou, for this, Sneer at dead Southern over Salamis, With merit in the bark that left thee there, And merit in the purse that paid thy fare; Is this the inspiration thou hast brought From that famed land, whose name gives wings to thought? Go, and at Bloomfield, Nature's Artist, sneer, Since chance, that makes a cobbler, makes a peer; Go, meet at Porter's hackney garreteers, And emulate their longitude of ears; Or, bray o'er Skiddaw a patrician strain, Though Wordsworth's ass disdains to bray again; Or, in thy Argo, heave a tuneful groan, While brazen sorrows melt a heart of stone; Or rhyme thy doggrel Juan, with vile ease; But cease to ape the Muse of Sophocles! Oh, Greece! I name thee with a feeling dread And mournful, as the kiss we give the dead; For thou art number'd with the yesterdays That hear no more the voice of mortal praise! Yet, if indeed thy stillness grasps a sword, If Freedom is to thee no lifeless word, If thou but sleep'st, wake! The odour'd hours Still sprinkle, as of yore, thy hills with flowers, And still âHymettus hears the hum of bees:â When wilt thou wake, land of Miltiades? Oh, never, never! for, in sadness bow'd, Nature but strews the wild thyme o'er thy shroud. 'Tis not the soil that lifts man's glories high, And gives a record to eternity, But Freedom's spirit, that inhabits there, With soul-inspiring ocean, earth, and air. Yetâwhere the skies, the seas, the mountains speak, In tones that bring the heart's blood to the cheek; Where dust is immortality, and mould An incarnation of the great of old;â Men of PlatÃ¦a, Men of Marathon, Rise, and deplore the Grecian glories gone! Then shake the earth from each prophetic brow, And say, shall Britain be what Greece is now? Without sage, sculptor, patriot, pencil, pen? A land where human beings are not men? Oh, ask yon slaves why gaze they on the plain, Rich with their fathers' blood, and rich in vain? Oh, ask, why look they on their servile feet, As if they fear'd in chainless Heaven to meet Th' upbraiding glances of the eagle's eye, Ascending to the sun of Liberty? Then hear the Bards of these portentous times, When Milton's verse is scorn'd for Lara's rhymes; And say, did Greece sit tamely down in chains, Till Pella's tragic voice was drown'd by ribald strains? Soul of th' Invincible! slaves laugh at thee; But let me share thy home, âhard Liberty!â Scorn tyrants' frowns, and pity servile fears, And proudly dip a freeman's crust in tears! Soul of th' Invincible! that bad'st arise The ghost of Clytemnestra, and, with cries That awed the Gods, chain earth with dread controul! Soul of the Shakspeare of the Furies! Soul Of suffering, in Prometheus conquering might, Almighty o'er Almightiness, till Right Brought to his injured knee the tyrant's brow! Soul of the Bard of Pella and of woe. And Nature's Art, the ever rivalless! Shall heâwhose taste, in utter tastelessness, Contemns the mighty rivals, sky and sea; Makes prose poetic, by geometry; And thinks a dull tale, of a game as dull, See in Lord Byron's Letter to Mr. Bowles, his allusion to the common-place description of a game at cards in the âRape of the Lock.â In vile burlesque sublime and beautiful, As all the pomp of regal foliage, thrown By Nature o'er the realms she calls her own; Shall heâwhile Labour in his drowsy piece, Libels the drama of indignant Greeceâ Shall he redeem our stage from sense and sin, To reinstate the powder'd wig of Quin, And, with a sneer that takes her by the nose, Bid Nature wear some French fop's cast-off hose? Yesâhater of the âNaturalsâ great and small, Though sometimes stumbling on the natural!â This shalt thou do, and things still more sublime, When thou hast mended Hamlet into rhyme; And, doubtless, thou wilt try to âshame the fools,â âSince bunglers only quarrel with their tools.â Yetâere we give the cap and bells to thee, And hail thee, scribbler, highest in degreeâ Say, Giaour, What makes our modern rhymesters great?â The living merit that we fear and hate. What makes thee praise those rhymesters?âDread of worth. And damn that merit?âEnvy, and so forth. What constitutes a Bard, in these late times? Childe Lara's budget, stuff'd with stolen rhymes. And what a mighty Bard?âA soul of gall, That aches to wound; âa vital scorn of all Ponds, and calm water, unless very clear;â A title, and ten thousand pounds a-year. What is a âPrince of modern Poets?ââOne Who gives dame Regan ten, Cordelia none; A madman, yet no Lear, but madly dull, As spleen, blue-devil'd, when the moon 's at full; A sage, who proves, by envy's axioms sure, That Homer was a drunken Irish Boor; A vagrant, who âhates Hounslow,â hates Sahara, See Hazlitt's Lecture on the Lakists. âHates all describers of the sunââbut Lara; âHates negus,â hates tom cats, âhates poetry,â âHates Wordsworth's ass,â âhates magnanimity.â âHates Milton's angels,â âhates imagination,â âHates Paddington canal,â âhates emulation,â âHates Englishmen,â who pay his hate with scorn, And quits their isle, âyet hates the solemn horn;â âHates home,â âhates tourists;â and, on foreign âstrondes,â Makes up, for sale, his patent vagabonds. What shall eclipse â(though matchless they,) all those Who write in rhyme what others write in prose?â The genuine, rhymed, demonstrative poetics, Dilworth's Arithmetic, in Harold's ethics. What song would merit statues in our day? A Doge of Venice, done by Algebra. How shall we write great works, like those in vogue? Take special care your hero be a rogue: No matter what the heroine, if not chaste; And let your glorious lines be penn'd in haste; Yet scorn the simpletons, whate'er their stature, Who learn inimitable art from Nature. Then, to the press, with wing'd impatience, send A tale, without beginning, middle, end, Wrote likeâlike what? like nought beneath the sun; And, lo, a third part of the task is done! Two friendly scribes, or so, will do the rest, And tell John Bull who writes worst nonsense best. Without their aid, in these impartial times, Even Pope himself would write unheeded rhymes; But with it, owls shriek sweetly as they range, And fulsome Moore's one note is endless change: Thus, by mere shuffling, our fool-flatter'd card, The ace of scribblers, is trump'd up a Bard. What is a scorner of blank verse and Shakspeare? Cannot this arrogant, un-English tourist, spend his money abroad, and quit his country in her misfortunes, without insulting her? A thing that loves to agitate the lakes here; Loves the stale theme, that dull stale triumph yields; Loves to out-prate the âprattle of green fields;â Loves to see Pegasus in Byron's Donkey; Loves female tabbies, and one crabb'd male monkey; Loves to commit the error he reproves; Loves women, loves to torture whom he loves; Loves Moore, loves Jeffrey, and to Scott is civil; Loves Cobbett's truth, loves Hazlitt, loves the devil; Loves to rhyme proseâfirst borrow'd with great pains; And loves to hate blind cobblers that have brains. For a noble attack on the Author of the âFarmer's Boy,â see âEnglish Bards and Scotch Reviewers.â When Pope was allowed to be the most vain of human beings, the modest claims of Byron had not been urged:ââa fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind!â but âthe poet of all civilizationâ had another quality in common with the âPrince of modern Bards,â namely, that warmth of heart, which cannot prudently be called cold-bloodednessâif truth is a libel. That his supreme delight was to insult poverty, that he boasted perpetually of his wealth, and that he attacked the defenceless, without provocation, and because they were defenceless, are facts that will become every day more obvious and acknowledged, whatever may be the fate of the âtrashy jingleâ which has given to his successor a âpaltry renown,â so called by himself, with at least as much truth as sincerity. No personification of vulgarity, no pampered footman, no successful scavenger, no purse-proud commercial upstart, ever assumed such airs of âimitated state;â and when squatted, like a toad, in the parlour of Bolinbrook, he, too, no doubt found himself tolerably âaristocratical in temper.â While Juans, Beppos, rise on every hand, While pedant rhymesters darken all the land, Who, though they know what blockhead means in Greek, Curse untaught genius each day in the week; And, like Gambado, amble for renown, But take the old highway to Horse-lie-down, See âGambado's Horsemanship,â for a picture of the âBridle way to Horse-lie-Down.â See oneâwhose Alma-Mater was the grove, Whose ablest teacher was the lip of loveâ See Bloomfield bend, âthe tenant of a stall,â See Want's poor Minstrel soar beyond them all. While, College-taught, each self-deceiving cheat Passes from fool to fool his counterfeit, Two coins alone are gold without alloy, The âTam o' Shanter,â and âThe Farmer's Boy.â But should some Lordâhis head with learning fraught, And yet in soul âunteachable, untaught,ââ Mock shamed Instruction with his heart of earth, Deride the noble poverty of worth, At naked genius lift his golden heel, âAnd, without feeling, torture all who feel;â Or, filch from Radcliffe's pages hour by hour, Kidnap Schedoni, and yclepe him Giaour; Or, cast the light on dead Bianchi's brow, Call her Medora, and throne death on snow; While Gibbon's thoughts, be-rhymed, from bad to worse Change, and awake, their second birth to curse, Twisting, as if bewitch'd, a thousand ways, Like the Pretender in Mackdonald's stays; Heav'ns! how each spaniel critic wags his tail! How lacquey'd fools at plackless talent rail! How miss and master scrawl, in tuneful fit, And each rich looby thinks himself a wit! Riseâthough the hand of monster-loving Fame Have graven on brass the blushless slanderer's nameâ Rise, Indignation! rise, some peasant Bard, With glowing breast, by Fortune's thunder scared! Convert to reaming ale the Cynic's sneer, Convert to wholesome bread an acrid Peer, Be Nature's Artist, by her ape foretold, And âof a sow's earâ make a purse of gold! âIt is the business of a great Poet,â says Lord Byron, âto give the lie to the proverb, and sometimes to âmake a silken purse out of a sow's ear.â Oh, Genius, name of envy, peril, dread, Like morn, in thunder o'er the mountains spread! In thee injustice doubly is unjustâ It chills to common clay thy burning dust. But, if thou build thy transitory sway On glaring clouds, that flash, and pass away, Think not thy curse, like lightning, thence shall strike The worth that scorns thy spleen and Time's, alike! Earth's sweetest flowers perfume the modest night, And green shall please, when scarlet tires the sight. Please?âBut what need hath he to please, or try, Who, in the purple born, of lineage high, Sees nought around but sycophantic awe? And what shall please the wretch whose will is law? The wearying want of something to desire, Waked, for our gain, thy soul's lampooning ire, That tilts at all; and (though thy itch to write âIs art unteachable,â instinctive spite,) Yet, hadst thou been in Misery's garret born, Child of that mother whom her offspring scorn, Who, with long woes, transmutes the soul to steel, And wrings the bosom till it cannot feel;â Hadst thou been one of that degraded crowd Who die unwept, or weep, in silence bow'd, Whom pain and want to crime and gibbet goad, Whom none salute, none envy, none applaud,â Poor, homeless, helpless, hopeless in distress, And deem'd still viler, if not meritless; No tuneful curse had tortured from thy tongue, No ribald o'er thy rhyme enraptured hung; But lordly Lara, haply, would have cried Matches and thread, from Holborn to Cheapside; Or cobbled shoes, the lowest of his tribe, Doom'd ne'er to rise by merit to a scribe; Or, cross-legg'd, crouch'd, the ninth part of an ape, Stitching the clothes he could not learn to shape, Hating the wielder of the shears and yard, And sunk in half a tailor all the bard. Say, who of all the praiseful sons of men, Had hail'd thee âGrand Turk of Parnassusâ then? Or, âPrince of Poets!â borrowing, like a prince, From all who wrote ere Shakspeare wrote, or since? Dictator of the letter'd Commonweal! Ne'er didst thou steal a thought, or wish to steal: The Commonweal is thine, and with it all That therein lives, to meditate, or scrawl: But, born to reign, and doom'd to scowl alone, Say, what man's virtues hast thou made thy own? Virtues!âah, what hath worth with fame to do? Who could be virtuous, and Childe Harold too? Not he who rivals in his spleeny rage The buried Harolds of each vanish'd age. Giaours of the past, once arm'd for petty strife, Conservers of the decencies of life, They see thee great, and mournâWhat can they less? Their lost supremacy in paltriness; And much they wonder, by what art, what power, The Giaour became, par eminence, the Giaour. Oh! from the venomous dust, ye famed of old For little souls, hot heads, and hearts as cold, Riseâwhile o'er myriad graves night's crescent bends, And question this Adonis of the Fiends! I see them rise! earth shrieksâthey re-assume The disembodied sneer: bad thoughts relume Each eye-left socket, as they forward press, And greet thee with fraternal eagerness! âLo, Giaour, thy triumph heaves our dust with sighs, Acuminates infernal agonies, And calls us up to praise thee with a groan, That makes our monarch tremble for his throne! Too high for envy, and for spleen too great, What worth hast thou not honour'd with thy hate? Magnanimous, as demigods of yore, To what forbearance hast thou deign'd to soar? What struggling merit hast thou stoop'd to raise? What pidling rhymester hast thou fail'd to praise? Let modern poets forswear âimagination, and addict themselves unto ethics,â and the âCorsairâ will keep the sea awhile. The âLuminary of the Ageâ has little to fear from the emulation of mere rhyming verbalistsâhe can afford to praise them; and his praises are echoed and re-echoed at humble distance, in almost every Number of the poor mechanical âMonthly.â This iteration is become the greatest bore in the universe, except the nauseous and eternal adulation of the âGreat Bardâ himself, by the Knight âwho plays the devil with the stars,â to the amusement of more than Bridge-street. âPoetry,â according to âthe Prince of modern Poets,â âis the most mechanical of the arts; and he is the greatest artist, who executes best, in whatever department!â in other words, an excellent sonnet-maker may be as great a poet as Shakspeare, or greater. Is there really no difference, in point of merit, between a Watt, or an Arkwright, and the artisan (at least equally mechanical) who executes faultlessly the sixteenth part of a pin? What says the most canting Lord Byron? What glorious littleness hast thou not dared? What wrong hast thou forgiven? what woman spared? If less than Fiend, more than misanthropist, Thou superhuman as a plagiarist! Th' eternity of marble quakes with fear, Our statues sweat, when thou approachest near; For we have statues! while the innocent Find in oblivion their sole monument. And art thou perfect? bright, without a stain? Proud as the meanest? weaker than the vain? Hast thou, too cunning to be wise, achieved The hypocrite's last conquest, self-deceived, And learn'd the art, taught only in our schools, To shew thy dread of wits, by praising fools? Art thou, in all things faultless, even as we? Another beacon, o'er Time's gloomy sea? Then hail, swart star, with baneful beams unshorn, Above all pity, yet beneath all scorn! We see thee rich in good, no grace withheld; For once we blush, and own ourselves excell'd; We blushâbehold our one repented sin! We blush, and feel a fiercer hell within.â They speak no more; the hissing growl expires; Those sockets have no light, extinct their fires: They fade away. Again âdoth darkness veil Each bitter smile, each forehead high and pale;â Earth groans, in horror and convulsion roll'd, And from her wonted guests the worm shrinks cold. Am I alone?âAh, no! they leave behind The climax of exalted heart and mind! He, proud and sad, o'er quivering nerves shall ride, With Moderator Malice at his side; Shall gaze on torture, with a Nero's eye, Pity no pang, spare no infirmity; With th' inquisition of the damn'd, shall tear Hearts, warm as Love, to lay their fibres bare; Make goodness feel what only guilt should know, âAnd rival all, but Lara's name, below.â In thought, I see him draw from virtue's woes Transport, the attar of the writhing rose, Drink, even in dreams, his victim's groans again, And swoon with pleasure, from imagined pain. Oh, would he deign to read, albeit in spite, These praiseful lines, which I so humbly write, In great forbearance be what he hath been, And stoop to answer, though with more than spleen, His scribbling slave; how soon that spleen should find That I, too, can excruciate mind with mind, Encounter angry scorn with scornful ire, And dip th' avenger's pen in poison'd fire! Oh, hear, for thou hast ears, my song delay'd! That I may eat, and publishers be paid. Thou dost not dread the âNaturalsâ alone, But every man whose merit is his own. Hating despotic power, like Castlereagh, Thou damn'st no genuine scribbler's ethic layâ Witness, praised tweedle-dum, and tweedle-dee, And stiff-rump'd Hope, and caudle Memory. 'Tis worth thou dread'st; and, not with groundless fears, Thy spleen devotes it to the Monthly Seers, Who ne'er of worth predicted good, alas! Though never came bad word of their's to pass. I threw not wide the gates which Pope had closed, To shew where Nature waked, while Hayley dosed; I did not earn thee praise, thy brief reward, And teach a rhymester to be half a bard; I build no deathless verse, with ease severe, I print no Epicâwhat hast thou to fear? I clothe, in language lucid as the light, No thoughts unborrow'd, as the blue of night; I am no SoutheyâI shall not outlive thee; Yet, though nor brainless, do not thou forgive me. I have no gold, impartial praise to buy, No rank, to bribe infallibility; But thy dark spleen, from worth reflected, shines Bright as the diamond in the night of mines, And lovely as the rose on virtue's shroud, It shews the rainbow in the weeping cloud. Hallow'd to envy, petulance, and spite, And unprofaned with dignity and light, Thy gloom illustrates what thou deign'st to sting, And gives to fortune's limbless worm a wing. Nor vainly hast thou lived, if doom'd to raise A brother hornet from neglect to praise, And justify the ways of Heaven, who calls The serpent and the toad to ruin's walls, Even as he calls young Spring from Winter's tomb, And warms with ice the snowdrop, till it bloom. Since this Volume was prepared for the press, Lord Byron has sent into the market another parcel of Plays,ââheavy goods,â on which it is impossible to look without an instantaneous conviction that the manufacturer of them wears a wig. Yet such things, he tells us, are still admired by all civilized people. Where was he born? Broad Scotch is a mixture of snuff and French; but pure French, is the only language of the regular drama. I speak advisedly. The Grecian dramatists did not observe the unities, though the most barbarous of their successors did: and the Italian drama, like his Lordship's, is but the shadow of the French. Does this ghost of the Huns presume to call himself civilized? But why should I furnish a plebeian example that a railer is not necessarily a man of genius? I have not written in vain, if I convince him that his favourite opinion is erroneous. Lettered barbarian as he is, I will not insult even him in his misfortunes. And I must now relate the most deplorable and humiliating of all possible or conceivable inflictions; not a horsewhipping, not a tweaking of the poetic nose, nor what the great Johnson might have termed âa pediferous catapultation of the Parnassian fundamentals:â oh, whisper it not on the Bridge of Sighs! Sir Richard Phillips has printed a compassionate critique on Lord Byron's Sardanapalus, the Two Foscari, and Cain, a Mystery. This might be endured: but, alas! the Monthly Reviewers have praised his Lordship's publication, and assigned to the Author a rank above Milton!! Who, after this, would write regular Dramas and Mysteries? THE END.</field>
