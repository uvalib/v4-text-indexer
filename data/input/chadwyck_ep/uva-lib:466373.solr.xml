      <field name="fulltext">L'INDIFFÉRENT WATTEAU The Louvre He dances on a toe As light as Mercury's: Sweet herald, give thy message! No, He dances on; the world is his, The sunshine and his wingy hat; His eyes are round Beneath the brim: To merely dance where he is found Is fate to him And he was born for that. He dances in a cloak Of vermeil and of blue: Gay youngster, underneath the oak, Come, laugh and love! In vain we woo; He is a human butterfly;— No soul, no kiss, No glance nor joy! Though old enough for manhood's bliss, He is a boy, Who dances and must die. VENUS, MERCURY AND CUPID CORREGGIO The National Gallery Here we have the lovely masque Of a Venus, in the braid Of bright oak-boughs, come to ask Hermes will he give a task To the little lad beside her, Who half hides and half doth guide her. Can there be indeed good cause Cupid should learn other art Than his mother's gracious laws? Hermes—Oh, the magic straws In his hat!—as one that pineth, To the pretty babe inclineth. Oh, the poignant hour serene, When sweet Love that is a child, When sweet Cupid comes between Troubled lovers as a screen, And the scolding and beseeching Are just turned to infant-teaching. DRAWING OF ROSES AND VIOLETS LEONARDO DA VINCI The Accademia of Venice Leonardo saw the spring Centuries ago, Saw the spring and loved it in its flowers— Violet, rose: One that grows Mystic, shining on the tufted bowers, And burns its incense to the summer hours; And one that hiding low, Half-face, half-wing, With shaded wiles Hides and yet smiles. Leonardo drew the blooms On an April day: How his subtle pencil loved its toil, Loved to draw! For he saw In the rose's amorous, open coil Women's placid temples that would foil Hearts in the luring way That checks and dooms Men with reserve Of limpid curve. Leonardo loved the still Violet as it blows, Plucked it from the darkness of its leaves, Where it shoots From wet roots; Found in it the precious smile that weaves Sweetness round Madonna's mouth and heaves Her secret lips, then goes, At its fine will, About her face He loved to trace. Leonardo drew in spring, Restless spring gone by, Flowers he chose should never after fade For the wealth Of strange stealth In the rose, the violet's half-displayed, Mysterious smile within the petals' shade That season did not die, Like everything, Of ruin's blight And April's flight. LA GIOCONDA LEONARDO DA VINCI The Louvre Historic, side-long, implicating eyes; A smile of velvet's lustre on the cheek; Calm lips the smile leads upward; hand that lies Glowing and soft, the patience in its rest Of cruelty that waits and doth not seek For prey; a dusky forehead and a breast Where twilight touches ripeness amorously: Behind her, crystal rocks, a sea and skies Of evanescent blue on cloud and creek; Landscape that shines suppressive of its zest For those vicissitudes by which men die. THE FAUN'S PUNISHMENT CORREGGIO The Louvre What has the tortured, old Faun been doing? What was his impious sin, That the Maenads have ceased from pursuing Cattle, with leaps and din, To compass him round, On woodland ground, With cords and faces dire,— Cords fastened with strain, Faces hate-stretched? Why have they fetched Snakes from the grass, with swift tongues of fire, And a reed from the stream-sodden plain? Beneath the sun's and the oak-leaves' flicker, They settle near—ah, near! One blows her reed, as dry as a wicker, Into the old Faun's ear; The scream of the wind, With flood combined, Rolls on his simple sense: It is anguish heard, For quietness splits Within; and fits Of gale and surge are a fierce offence To him who knows but the breeze or bird. One sits with fanciful eyes beside him; Malice and wonder mix In her glance at the victim—woe betide him, When once her snakes transfix His side! Ere they dart, With backward start She waits their rigid pause; And with comely stoop One maid, elate With horror, hate And triumph, up from his ankle draws The skin away in a clinging loop. Before the women a boy-faun dances, Grapes and stem at his chin,— Mouth of red the red grape-bunch enhances Ere it is sucked within By the juicy lips, Free as the tips Of tendrils in their curve; And his flaccid cheek, Mid mirthful heaves And ripples, weaves A guiltless smile that might almost serve For the vines themselves in vintage-week. What meaning is here, or what mystery, What fate, and for what crime? Why so fearful this silvan history Of a far summer-time? There was no ill-will That day until With fun the grey-beard shook At the Maenads' torn, Spread hair, their brave, Tumultuous wave Dancing; and women will never brook Mirth at their folly, O doomed, old Faun! THE BIRTH OF VENUS SANDRO BOTTICELLI The Uffizi Frills of brimming wavelets lap Round a shell that is a boat; Roses fly like birds and float Down the crisp air; garments flap: Midmost of the breeze, with locks In possession of the wind, Coiling hair in loosened shocks, Sways a girl who seeks to bind New-born beauty with a tress Gold about her nakedness. And her chilled, wan body sweet Greets the ruffled cloak of rose, Daisy-stitched, that Flora throws Toward her ere she set her feet On the green verge of the world: Flora, with the corn-flower dressed, Round her neck a rose-spray curled Flowerless, wild-rose at her breast, To her goddess hastes to bring The wide chiton of the spring. While from ocean, breathing hard, With sole pressure toward the bay,— Olive raiment, pinions grey By clipt rose-stems thinly starred, Zephyrus and Boreas pass, One in wonder, one desire: And the cool sea's dawnlit mass Boreas' foot has lifted higher, As he blows the shell to land, Where the reed invades the sand. She who treads the rocking shell— Tearful shadow in her eyes Of reluctant sympathies, On her mouth a pause, a spell, Candour far too lone to speak And no knowledge on her brows; Virgin stranger, come to seek Covert of strong orange-boughs By the sea-wind scarcely moved,— She is Love that hath not loved. ANTIOPE CORREGGIO The Louvre Noontide's whiteness of full sun Illumes her sleep; Its heat is on her limbs and one White arm with sweep Of languor falls around her head: She cuddles on the lap of earth; While almost dead Asleep, forgetful of his mirth, A dimpled Cupid at her side Sprawls satisfied. Conquered, weary with the light, Her eyelids orb: Summer's plenitude of might Her lips absorb,— Uplifted to the burning air And with repletion fallen apart. Her form is bare, But her doe-skin binds each dart Of her woodland armory, Laid idle by. She is curled beyond the rim Of oaks that slide Their lowest branches, long and slim, Close to her side; Their foliage touches her with lobes Half-gay, half-shadowed, green and brown: Her white throat globes, Thrown backward, and her breasts sink down With the supineness of her sleep, Leaf-fringed and deep. Where her hand has curved to slip Across a bough, Fledged Cupid's slumberous fingers grip The turf and how Close to his chin he hugs her cloak! His torch reversed trails on the ground With feeble smoke; For in noon's chastity profound, In the blank glare of mid-day skies, Love's flambeau dies. But the sleepers are not left To breathe alone; A god is by with hoofs deep-cleft, Legs overgrown With a rough pelt and body strong: Yet must the head and piercing eyes In truth belong To some Olympian in disguise; From lawless shape or mien unkempt They are exempt. Zeus, beneath these oaken boughs, As satyr keeps His watch above the woman's brows And backward sweeps Her cloak to flood her with the noon; Curious and fond, yet by a clear Joy in the boon Of beauty franchised—beauty dear To him as to a tree's bent mass The sunny grass. TREADING THE PRESS BENOZZO GOZZOLI The Campo Santo at Pisa From the trellis hang the grapes Purple-deep; Maidens with white, curving napes And coiled hair backward leap, As they catch the fruit, mid laughter, Cut from every silvan rafter. Baskets, over-filled with fruit, From their heads Down into the press they shoot A white-clad peasant treads, Firmly crimson circles smashing Into must with his feet's thrashing. Wild and rich the oozings pour From the press; Leaner grows the tangled store Of vintage, ever less: Wine that kindles and entrances Thus is made by one who dances. SPRING SANDRO BOTTICELLI The Accademia of Florence Venus is sad among the wanton powers, That make delicious tempest in the hours Of April or are reckless with their flowers: Through umbrageous orange-trees Sweeps, mid azure swirl, the Breeze, That with clipping arms would seize Eôs, wind-inspired and mad, In wind-tightened muslin clad, With one tress for stormy wreath And a bine between her teeth. Flora foots it near in frilled, Vagrant skirt, with roses filled; Pinks and gentians spot her robe And the curled acanthus-lobe Edges intricate her sleeve; Rosy briars a girdle weave, Blooms are brooches in her hair: Though a vision debonair, Thriftless, venturesome, a grace Disingenuous lights her face; Curst she is, uncertain-lipped, Riggishly her dress is whipped By little gusts fantastic. Will she deign To toss her double-roses, or refrain? These riot by the left side of the queen; Before her face another group is seen: In ordered and harmonic nobleness, Three maidens circle o'er the turf—each dress Blown round the tiptoe shape in lovely folds Of air-invaded white; one comrade holds Her fellow's hand on high, the foremost links Their other hands in chain that lifts and sinks. Their auburn tresses ripple, coil or sweep; Gems, amulets and fine ball-fringes keep Their raiment from austereness. With reserve The dancers in a garland slowly curve. They are the Graces in their virgin youth; And does it touch their Deity with ruth That they must fade when Eros speeds his dart? Is this the grief and forethought of her heart? For she is sad, although fresh myrtles near Her figure chequer with their leaves the drear, Grey chinks that through the orange-trees appear: Clothed in spring-time's white and red, She is tender with some dread, As she turns a musing head Sideways mid her veil demure; Her wide eyes have no allure, Dark and heavy with their pain. She would bless, and yet in vain Is her troubled blessing: Love, Blind and tyrannous above, Shoots his childish flame to mar Those without defect, who are Yet unspent and cold with peace; While, her sorrow to increase, Hermes, leader of her troop— His short cutlass on the loop Of a crimson cloak, his eye Clear in its fatality— Rather seems the guide of ghosts To the dead, Plutonian coasts, Than herald of Spring's immature, gay band: He plucks a ripened orange with his hand. The tumult and the mystery of earth, When woods are bleak and flowers have sudden birth, When love is cruel, follow to their end The God that teaches Shadows to descend, But pauses now awhile, with solemn lip And left hand laid victorious on his hip. The triumph of the year without avail Is blown to Hades by blue Zephyr's gale. Across the seedling herbage coltsfoot grows Between the tulip, heartsease, strawberry-rose, Fringed pinks and dull grape-hyacinth. Alas, At play together, through the speckled grass Trip Youth and April: Venus, looking on, Beholds the mead with all the dancers gone. A PORTRAIT BARTOLOMMEO VENETO The Städel' sche Institut at Frankfurt A crystal, flawless beauty on the brows Where neither love nor time has conquered space On which to live; her leftward smile endows The gazer with no tidings from the face; About the clear mounds of the lip it winds with silvery pace And in the umber eyes it is a light Chill as a glowworm's when the moon embrowns an August night. She saw her beauty often in the glass, Sharp on the dazzling surface, and she knew The haughty custom of her grace must pass: Though more persistent in all charm it grew As with a desperate joy her hair across her throat she drew In crinkled locks stiff as dead, yellow snakes . . . Until at last within her soul the resolution wakes She will be painted, she who is so strong In loveliness, so fugitive in years: Forth to the field she goes and questions long Which flowers to choose of those the summer bears; She plucks a violet larkspur,—then a columbine appears Of perfect yellow,—daisies choicely wide; These simple things with finest touch she gathers in her pride. Next on her head, veiled with well-bleachen white And bound aeross the brow with azure-blue, She sets the box-tree leaf and coils it tight In spiky wreath of green, immortal hue; Then, to the prompting of her strange, emphatic insight true, She bares one breast, half-freeing it of robe, And hangs green-water gem and cord beside the naked globe. So was she painted and for centuries Has held the fading field-flowers in her hand Austerely as a sign. O fearful eyes And soft lips of the courtesan who planned To give her fragile shapeliness to art, whose reason spanned Her doom, who bade her beauty in its cold And vacant eminence persist for all men to behold! She had no memories save of herself And her slow-fostered graces, naught to say Of love in gift or boon; her cruel pelf Had left her with no hopes that grow and stay; She found default in everything that happened night or day, Yet stooped in calm to passion's dizziest strife And gave to art a fair, blank form, unverified by life. Thus has she conquered death: her eyes are fresh, Clear as her frontlet jewel, firm in shade And definite as on the linen mesh Of her white hood the box-tree's sombre braid, That glitters leaf by leaf and with the year's waste will not fade. The small, close mouth, leaving no room for breath, In perfect, still pollution smiles—Lo, she has conquered death! SAINT KATHARINE OF ALEXANDRIA BARTOLOMMEO VENETO The Städel' sche Institut at Frankfurt A little wreath of bay about her head, The Virgin-Martyr stands, touching her wheel With finger-tips that from the spikes of steel Shrink, though a thousand years she has been dead. She bleeds each day as on the day she bled; Her pure, gold cheeks are blanched, a cloudy seal Is on her eyes; the mouth will never feel Pity again; the yellow hairs are spread Downward as damp with sweat; they touch the rim Of the green bodice that to blackness throws The thicket of bay-branches sharp and trim Above her shoulder: open landscape glows Soft and apart behind her to the right, Where a swift shallop crosses the moonlight. SAINT SEBASTIAN CORREGGIO The Dresden Gallery Bound by thy hands, but with respect unto thine eyes how free Fixed on Madonna, seeing all that they were born to see! The Child thine upward face hath sighted, Still and delighted; Oh, bliss when with mute rites two souls are plighted! As the young aspen-leaves rejoice, though to the stem held tigl In the soft visit of the air, the current of the light, Thou hast the peril of a captive's chances, Thy spirit dances, Caught in the play of Heaven's divine advances. While cherubs straggle on the clouds of luminous, curled fire, The Babe looks through them, far below, on thee with soft desire. Most clear of bond must they be reckoned— No joy is second To theirs whose eyes by other eyes are beckoned. Though arrows rain on breast and throat they have no power to hurt, While thy tenacious face they fail an instant to avert. Oh might my eyes, so without measure, Feed on their treasure, The world with thong and dart might do its pleasure! A ‘SANT’ IMAGINE’ FIORENZO DI LORENZO The Städel'sche Institut at Frankfurt A Holy Picture—variably fair In colour and fantastic in device! With what an ecstasy is laid The pattern of this red brocade, Blood-red above Madonna's seat for glory; But gold and black behind the victor-two Who, full in view Of the great, central form, in thought Live through the martyrdom they wrought; Afresh, with finer senses, suffer and despair. Why is their story Set in such splendour one must note the nice Edge of the arras and the glancing tone Of jacinth floor, pale rose before the Virgin's throne? A young St. Christopher, with Umbria's blue Clear in his eyes, stands nobly to the right And questions how the thing may hap The little, curious, curled-up chap, That clings almost astride upon his shoulder And with uncertain baby-fingers lays A pat of praise On the crisp, propping head, should press Upon him to acute distress. Vainly he turns; within the child's eyes is no clue; And he with colder Heart must give succour to the sad in plight: To him no secrets of his doom are known; Who suffers fate to load must bear the load alone. And wherefore doth Madonna thus look down So wistful toward the book upon her knees? Has she no comfort? Is there need Within the Scriptures she should read Who to the living Word her bosom presses? With bliss of her young Babe so near, Is it not drear Darkly from books to understand What bodes his coming to the land? Alas, as any other child he catches at her gown And, with caresses, Breaks on her still Magnificat: to ease And give air to her spirit with her own Christ she must hold communion in great songs alone. She bows and sheds no comfort on the boy Whose face turns on her full of bleeding tears, Sebastian, with the arrows' thrill Intolerable to him still, Full of an agony that has no measure, That cannot rise, grow to the height and wane, Being simple pain That to his nature is as bound As anguish to the viol's sound: He suffers as the sensitive enjoy; And, as their pleasure, His pain is hid from common eyes and ears. Wide-gaping as for air, breathing no moan, His delicate, exhausted lips are open thrown. And now back to the picture's self we come, Its subtle, glowing spirit; turn our eyes From those grave, isolated, strange Figures, to feel how sweet the range Of colour in the marbles, with what grace is Sebastian's porphyry-column reared aloft! How waving, soft And fringed the palm-branch of the stave Saint Christopher exalts!—they must have all things brave About them who are born for martyrdom: The fine, stern faces Refuse so steadily what they despise; The world will never mix them with her own— They choose the best, and with the best are left alone. THE RESCUE TINTORETTO The Dresden Gallery Grey tower, green sea, dark armour and clear curves Of shining flesh; the tower built far into the sea And the dark armour that of one coming to set her free Who, white against the chamfered base, From fetters that her noble limbs enlace Bows to confer Herself on her deliverer: He, dazzled by the splendid gift, Steadies himself against his oar, ere he is strong to lift And strain her to his breast: Her powerful arms lie in such heavy rest Across his shoulder, though he swerves And staggers with her weight, though the wave buoys, Then slants the vessel, she maintains his form in poise. Her sister-captive, seated on the side Of the swayed gondola, her arched, broad back in strain, Strikes her right ankle, eager to discumber it of chain, Intent upon her work, as though It were full liberty ungyved to go. She will not halt, But spring delighted to the salt, When fetterless her ample form Can beat the refluence of the waves back to their crested storm. Has she indeed caught sight Of that blithe tossing pinnace on the white Scum of the full, up-bearing tide? The rose-frocked rower-boy, in absent fit Or modesty, surveys his toe and smiles at it. Her bondage irks not; she has very truth Of freedom who within her lover's face can seek For answer to her eyes, her breath, the blood within her cheek— A soul so resolute to bless She has forgot her shining nakedness And to her peer Presents immunity from fear: As one half-overcome, half-braced, The man's hand searches as he grips her undulating waist: So these pure twain espouse And without ravishment, mistrust, or vows Of constancy fulfil their youth; In the rough niches of the wall behind Their meeting heads, how close the trails of ivy wind! VENUS AND MARS SANDRO BOTTICELLI The National Gallery She is a fate, although She lies upon the grass, While satyrs shout Ho, ho! At what she brings to pass; And nature is as free Before her strange, young face As if it knew that she Were in her sovereign place, With shading trees above. The little powers of earth on woolly hips Are gay as children round a nurse they love; Nor do they watch her lips. A cushion, crimson-rose, Beneath her elbow heaves; Her head, erect in pose Against the laurel-leaves, Is looped with citron hair That cunning plaits adorn. Beside her instep bare And dress of crimpled lawn Fine blades of herbage rise; The level field that circles her retreat Is one grey-lighted green the early sky's Fresh blue inclines to meet. Her swathing robe is bound With gold that is not new: She rears from off the ground As if her body grew Triumphant as a stem That hath received the rains, Hath softly sunk with them, And in an hour regains Its height and settledness. Yet are her eyes alert; they search and weigh The god, supine, who fell from her caress When love had had its sway. He lies in perfect death Of sleep that has no spasm; It seems his very breath Is lifted from a chasm, So sunk he lies. His hair In russet heaps is spread; Thus couches in its lair A creature that is dead: But, see, his nostrils scent New joy and tighten palpitating nerves, Although his naked limbs, their fury spent, Are fallen in wearied curves. Athwart his figure twist Some wreathy folds of white, Crossed by the languid wrist And loose palm of his right, Wan hand; the other drops Its fingers down beside The coat of mail that props His shoulder; crimson-dyed, His cloak winds under him; One leg is stretched, one raised in arching lines: Thus, opposite the queen, his body slim And muscular reclines. An impish satyr blows The mottled conch in vain Beside his ear that knows No whine of the sea-strain; Another tugs his spear, One hides within his casque Soft horns and jaunty leer; While one presumes to bask Within his breastplate void And rolls its tongue in open-hearted zest: Above the sleeper, their dim wings annoyed, The wasps have made a nest. O tragic forms, the man, The woman—he asleep, She lone and sadder than The dawn, too wise to weep Illusion that to her Is empire, to the earth Necessity and stir Of sweet, predestined mirth! Ironical she sees, Without regret, the work her kiss has done And lives a cold enchantress doomed to please Her victims one by one. THE DEATH OF PROCRIS PIERO DI COSIMO The National Gallery Ah, foolish Procris!—short and brown She lies upon the leafy, littoral plain; Her scarlet cloak, her veil have both slipped down And rest Across her loins; the naked feet are bound With sandals of dull gold, their thongs being wide And interlaced; the body's swelling side Crushes the arm; each sterile breast Is grey; upon the throat there is a stain Of blood and on the hand along the ground. She gave no mortal cry, But voiceless and consumed by drouth, Far from the town she might not gain, Beside a river-mouth She dragged herself to die. Her auburn tresses part or coil Below a wimple of most sombre blue; They fleck the green of the luxuriant soil Or drift Thinly athwart the outline of her ear. Time has been passing since she last drew breath; She has the humble, clay-cold look of death Within the open world; no rift Has come between the eyelids, of a hue Monotonous—a paleness drear. Her brows attest no thought; Her lips, that quick destruction stains, Shall never kiss her husband, never sue For pardon: she remains A quarry none has sought. And thus she lies half-veiled, half-bare, Deep in the midst of nature that abides Inapprehensive she is lying there, So wan; The flowers, the silver estuary afar— These daisies, plantains, all the white and red Field-blossoms through the leaves and grasses spread; The water with its pelican, Its flight of sails and its blue countrysides— Unto themselves they are: The dogs sport on the sand, The herons curve above the reeds Or one by one descend the air, While lifelessly she bleeds From throat and dabbled hand. Russet and large against the sky, Two figures at her head and feet are seen; One is a solemn hound, one utterly A faun, A creature of wild fashion, with black fell On which a fleshy, furrèd ear loops out; Under his chin the boorish bristles sprout Distinct; an onyx-banded horn Springs from each temple; slender legs between The herbage peep and well- Fleeced thighs; his left hand grips Her shoulder and the right along Her forehead moves: his mellow eye Is indecisive; strong, Coarse pity swells his lips. The tall dog's vigil and the gaze Of the wild man, by eagerness bent low, Have each a like expression of amaze And deep, Respectful yearning: these two watchers pass Out of themselves, though only to attain Incomprehensible, half-wakened pain. They cannot think nor weep Above this perished jealousy and woe, This prostrate, human mass; But with vague souls they sit And gaze, while tide and bloom and bird Live on in their familiar ways, By mortal grief unstirred And never sad with it. Yet autumn comes, there is the light Born of October's lateness in the sky And on the sea-side; leaves have taken flight From yon, Slim seedling-birch on the rivage, the flock Of herons has the quiet of solitude, That comes when chills on sunny air intrude; The little ships must soon be gone, And soon the pale and ruddy flowers shall die, Save the untransient plants that block Their green out, ebon-clear, Against the distance, while they drop, On hound and satyr settled nigh, Red tassels that shall stop Till windy snows appear. SAINT JEROME IN THE DESERT COSIMO TURA The National Gallery Saint Jerome kneels within the wilderness; Along the cavern's sandy channels press The flowings of deep water. On one knee, On one foot he rests his weight— A foot that rather seems to be The clawed base of a pillar past all date Than prop of flesh and bone; About his sallow, osseous frame A cinder-coloured cloak is thrown For ample emblem of his shame. Grey are the hollowed rocks, grey is his head And grey his beard that, formal and as dread As some Assyrian's on a monument, From the chin is sloping down. O'er his tonsure heaven has bent A solid disc of unillumined brown; His scarlet hat is flung Low on the pebbles by a shoot Of tiny nightshade that among The pebbles has maintained a root. He turns his face—yea, turns his body where They front the cleanness of the sky and air; We feel, although we see not, what he sees. From the hidden desert flows An uncontaminated breeze That terrible in censure round him blows; While the horizons brim His eyes with silver glare and it Casts, in its purity, on him An accusation infinite. Sublime and fierce, he will not budge Although each element becomes his judge: For is not life the breath of God and thought God's own light across the brain? Yet he, in whom these powers have wrought, Hath dared with slow and lusting flesh to stain Their operations clear As those of sunshine and the wind: He is unfit for sigh or tear, So whole the sin that he hath sinned, Thus having done the man within him wrong. He lifts his arm, the tendons of it strong As rods, the fingers resolute and tense Round a flint-stone in the hand; Against his breast, with vehemence, He aims a blow, as if at God's command. His breast of flint awaits Much flagellation; pleasure fills The body courage reinstates Enduring what the spirit wills. Dark wisdom, dread asceticism!—See, The night-owl, set athwart a rock-bound tree Below the cave, rolls pertinacious eyes On the penitence that bleeds, That in abashed absorption tries To rouse the mere forgetfulness it needs. But lo! a white bird's wings Find on the cliff a resting-place:— If man looks forth on unsoiled things, His own defilement he must face, With somewhat of the hermit's rage of shame, That only smarting chastisement can tame: Yet Jerome's mood is humbler, surer far When, distressful penance done, His grey-bound volumes, his red Vulgate are Laid on his lap and he within the sun Is writing, undismayed As the quiet cowherd who attends His kine, beneath a colonnade, Where yonder, ancient hill ascends. METTUS CURTIUS UNKNOWN The National Gallery He comes from yonder castle on the steep, No Roman, but a lovely Christian knight, With azure vest and florid mantle bright, Blown, golden hair and youthful face flushed deep For glory in the triumph of the leap. Though his mild, amber horse rears back at sight Of the red flames, though poised for thrust his right Hand grasps a knife, his countenance doth keep Soft as Saint Michael's with the devil at bay. So sweet it is to cast one's life away In the fresh pride and perfume of its breath! He smiles to think how soon the cleft will close: And see, a sun-brimmed cloud above him throws Its white effulgence, as he fares to death. A FÊTE CHAMPÊTRE ANTOINE WATTEAU The Dresden Gallery A lovely, animated group That picnic on a marble seat, Where flaky boughs of beeches droop, Where gowns in woodland sunlight glance, Where shines each coy, lit countenance; While sweetness rules the air, most sweet Because the day Is deep within the year that shall decay: They group themselves around their queen, This lady in the yellow dress, With bluest knots of ribbon seen Upon her breast and yellow hair; But the reared face proclaims Beware! To him who twangs his viol less To speak his joy Than her soon-flattered choiceness to annoy. Beside her knee a damsel sits, In petticoat across whose stripes Of delicate decision flits The wind that shows them blue and white And primrose round a bodice tight— As grey as is the peach that ripes: Her hair was spun For Zephyrus among the threads to run. She on love's varying theme is launched— Ah, youth!—behind her, roses lie, The latest, artless roses, blanched Around a hectic centre. Two Protesting lovers near her sue And quarrel, Cupid knows not why: Withdrawn and tart, One gallant stands in reverie apart. Proud of his silk and velvet, each Plum-tinted, of his pose that spurns The company, his eyes impeach A Venus on an ivied bank, Who rests her rigorous, chill flank Against a water-jet and turns Her face from those Who wanton in the coloured autumn's close. Ironical he views her shape of stone And the harsh ivy and grey mound; Then sneers to think she treats her own Enchanted couples with contempt, As though her bosom were exempt From any care, while tints profound Touch the full trees And there are warning notes in every breeze. The coldness of mere pleasure when Its hours are over cuts his heart: That Love should rule the earth and men For but a season year by year And then must straightway disappear, Even as the summer weeks depart, Has thrilled his brain With icy anger and censorious pain. Alas, the arbour-foliage now, As cornfields when they lately stood Awaiting harvest, bough on bough Is saffron. Yonder to the left A straggling rose-bush is bereft Of the last roses of the wood; For one or two Still flicker where the balmy dozens grew. On the autumnal grass the pairs Of lovers couch themselves and raise A facile merriment that dares Surprise the vagueness of the sun October to a veil has spun About the heads and forest-ways— Delicious light Of gold so pure it half-refines to white. Yet Venus from this world of love, Of haze and warmth has turned: as yet None feels it save the trees above, The roses in their soft decline And one ill-humoured libertine. Soon shall all hearts forget The vows they swore And the leaves strew the glade's untrodden floor. A SHEPHERD-BOY GIORGIONE Hampton Court A radiant, oval face: the hair About the cheeks so blond in hue It shades to greenness here and there Against the ground of densest blue A cloak flax-grey, a shirt of white, That yellow spots of sunshine fleck; The face aglow with southern light, Deep, golden sunbrown on the neck; Warm eyes, sweet mouth of the softest lips: Yea, though he is not playing, His hand a flute Pandean grips, Across one hole a finger laying. His flesh a golden haze, the line Of cheek and chin is only made By modulation, perfect, fine, Of their rich colour into shade. His curls have sometime veiled the top Of the wide forehead,—we can see How where the sunbeams might not stop A subtle whiteness stretches, free From the swarthy burning of their love: The opened shirt exposes Fair skin that meets the stain above Half-coyly with its white and roses. Not merely does he bear the sun Thus visible on limb and head, His countenance reveals him one Of those whose characters are fed By light—the largeness of its ways, The breadth and patience in its joy. Evenings of sober azure, days Of heat have influenced the lone boy To dream with never a haunting thought, To be too calm for gladness And in the hill-groves to have caught Hints of intensest summer sadness. Yet pain can never overcast A soul thus solemnly subdued To muse upon an open past Of sunshine, love and solitude. Maternal nature and his own Secluded mother are the sole Companions he has ever known; His earliest innocence is whole: His mouth, attuned to the silvan breeze, Is mobile with the blowing Of notes beneath the olive-trees Or where an upland source is flowing. Ah, Golden Age, time has run back And fetched you for our eyes to greet And set you to repair our lack Of splendour that is truly sweet, By showing us how life can rear Its children to enjoying sense Of all that visits eye and ear, Through days of restful reticence. Delight will never be slow to come To youth that lays its finger On the flute's stop and yet is dumb And loves with its dumb self to linger. SAINT SEBASTIAN ANTONELLO DA MESSINA The Dresden Gallery Young Sebastian stands beside a lofty tree, Rigid by the rigid trunk that branchlessly Lifts its column on the blue Of a heaven that takes Hyacinthine hue From a storm that wellnigh breaks. Shadiness and thunder dout the zenith's light, Yet a wide horizon still extends as bright As the lapis-lazuli; Poignant sunshine streams Over land and sky, With tempestuous, sunken beams. He who was a soldier late is standing now Stript and fastened to the tree that has no bough, In the centre of a court, That is bound by walls Fancifully wrought, Over which the daylight falls. Arch and chimney rise aloft into the air: On the balconies are hung forth carpets rare Of an Eastern, vivid red; Idle women lean Where the rugs are spread, Each with an indifferent mien. On the marble of the courtyard, fast asleep, Lies a brutish churl, his body in a heap; Two hard-hearted comrades prate Where a portal shows Distance blue and great, Stretching onward in repose. And between the shafts of sandy-coloured tone Slips a mother with her child: but all alone Stays Sebastian in his grief. What soul pities him! Who shall bring relief From the darts that pierce each limb? Naked, almost firm as sculpture, is his form, Nobly set below the burthen of the storm; Shadow, circling chin and cheek, Their ellipse defines, Then the shade grows weak And his face with noonday shines— Shines as olive marble that reflects the mere Radiance it receives upon a surface clear; For we see no blessedness On his visage pale, Turned in its distress Toward the heaven, without avail. Massive is his mouth; the upper lip is set In a pained, protesting curve: his eyes have met God within the darkening sky And dispute His will, Dark, remorselessly Fervent to dispute it still. The whole brow is hidden by the chestnut hair, That behind the back flows down in locks and there Changes to a deeper grain. Though his feet were strong, They are swoln with strain, For he has been standing long. Captive, stricken through by darts, yet armed with power That resents the coming on of its last hour, Sound in muscle is the boy, Whom his manhood fills With an acrid joy, Whom its violent pressure thrills. But this force implanted in him must be lost And its natural validity be crossed By a chill, disabling fate; He must stand at peace While his hopes abate, While his youth and vigour cease. At his feet a mighty pillar lies reversed; So the virtue of his sex is shattered, cursed: Here is martyrdom and not In the arrows' sting; This the bitter lot His soul is questioning. He, with body fresh for use, for pleasure fit, With its energies and needs together knit In an able exigence, Must endure the strife, Final and intense, Of necessity with life. Yet throughout this bold rebellion of the saint Noonday's brilliant air has carried no complaint. Lo, across the solitude Of the storm two white, Little clouds obtrude Storm-accentuating light! THE MAGDALEN TIMOTEO VITI The Accademia at Bologna This tender sylph of a maid Is the Magdalen—this figure lone: Her attitude is swayed By the very breath she breathes, The prayer of her being that takes no voice. Boulders, the grass enwreathes, Arch over her as a cave That of old an earthquake clave And filled with stagnant gloom: Yet a woman has strength to choose it for her room. Her long, fair hair is allowed To wander in its thick simpleness; The graceful tresses crowd Unequal, yet close enough To have woven about her neck and breast A wimple of golden stuff. Though the rock behind is rude, The sweetness of solitude Is on her face, the soft Withdrawal that in wild-flowers we have loved so oft. Her mantle is scarlet-red In folds of severe resplendency; Her hair beneath is spread Full-length; from its lower flakes Her feet come forth in their naked charm: A wind discreetly shakes The scarlet raiment, the hair. Her small hands, a tranquil pair, Are laid together; her book And cup of ointment furnish scantily her nook. She is happy the livelong day, Yet her thoughts are often with the past; Her sins are done away, They can give her no annoy. She is white—oh! infinitely clean And her heart throbs with joy; Besides, there is joy in heaven That her sins are thus forgiven; And she thinks till even-fall Of the grace, the strangeness, the wonder of it all. She is shut from fellowship; How she loved to mingle with her friends! To give them eyes and lip; She lived for their sake alone; Not a braid of her hair, not a rose Of her cheek was her own: And she loved to minister To any in want of her, All service was so sweet: Now she must stand all day on lithe, unsummoned feet. Among the untrodden weeds And moss she is glad to be remote; She knows that when God needs From the sinning world relief, He will find her thus with the wild bees, The doves and the plantain-leaf, Waiting in a perfect peace For His kingdom's sure increase, Waiting with a deeper glow Of patience every day, because He tarrieth so. By her side the box of nard Unbroken . . . God is a great way off; She loves Him: it is hard That she may not now even spread The burial-spice, who would gladly keep The tomb where He lay dead, As it were her rocky cave; And fold the linen and lave The napkin that once bound His head; no place for her pure arts is longer found. And these are the things that hurt; For the rest she gives herself no pain: She wears no camel shirt, She uses nor scourge, nor rod; But bathes her fair body in the well And keeps it pure for God: The beauty, that He hath made So bright, she guards in the shade, For, as an angel's dress, Spotless she must preserve her new-born loveliness. Day by day and week by week, She lives and muses and makes no sound; She has no words to speak The joy that her desert brings: In her heart there is a song And yet no song she sings. Since the word Rabboni came Straightway at the call of her name And the Master reproved, It seems she has no choice—her lips have never moved. She stole away when the pale Light was trembling on the garden-ground And others told the tale, Christ was risen; she roamed the wide, Fearful countries of the wilderness And many a river-side, Till she found her destined grot, South, in France, a woody spot, Where she is often glad, Musing on those great days when she at first grew sad. A PEN-DRAWING OF LEDA SODOMA The Grand Duke's Palace at Weimar 'Tis Leda lovely, wild and free, Drawing her gracious Swan down through the grass to see Certain round eggs without a speck: One hand plunged in the reeds and one dinting the downy neck, Although his hectoring bill Gapes toward her tresses, She draws the fondled creature to her will. She joys to bend in the live light Her glistening body toward her love, how much more bright! Though on her breast the sunshine lies And spreads its affluence on the wide curves of her waist and thighs, To her meek, smitten gaze Where her hand presses The Swan's white neck sink Heaven's concentred rays. MARRIAGE OF BACCHUS AND ARIADNE TINTORETTO The Ducal Palace at Venice Dark sea-water round a shape Hung about the loins with grape, Hair the vine itself, in braids On the brow—thus Bacchus wades Through the water to the shore. Strange to deck with hill-side store Limbs that push against the tide; Strange to gird a wave-washed side Foam should spring at and entwine— Strange to burthen it with vine. He has left the trellised isle, Left the harvest vat awhile, Left the Maenads of his troop, Left his Fauns' midsummer group And his leopards far behind, By lone Dia's coast to find Her whom Theseus dared to mock. Queenly on the samphire rock Ariadne sits, one hand Stretching forth at Love's command. Love is poised above the twain, Zealous to assuage the pain In that stately woman's breast; Love has set a starry crest On the once dishonoured head; Love entreats the hand to wed, Gently loosening out the cold Fingers toward that hoop of gold Bacchus, tremblingly content To be patient, doth present. In his eyes there is the pain Shy, dumb passions can attain In the valley, on the skirt Of lone mountains, pine-begirt; Yearning pleasure such as pleads In dark wine that no one heeds Till the feast is ranged and lit. But his mouth—what gifts in it! Though the round lips do not dare Aught to proffer, save a prayer. Is he not a mendicant Who has almost died of want? Through far countries he has roved, Blessing, blessing, unbeloved; Therefore is he come in weed Of a mortal bowed by need, With the bunches of the grape As sole glory round his shapc: For there is no god that can Taste of pleasure save as man. THE FIGURE OF VENUS IN ‘SPRING’ SANDRO BOTTICELLI The Accademia of Florence I Asimple lady full of heavy thought: Behind her neck the myrtle-bowers lie cold; Her robe is white, her carmine mantle rolled And lifted on her arm that beareth nought: A flame-tipped arrow in its arc is brought Above by Eros; ornaments of gold Are crossed chainwise about her chest to hold The unfilled breasts; her right hand as she sought To bless is lifted and then stays at pause As fearful to cast sorrow for delight On her girl-votaries. Must her coming cause Their stately freedom quite to disappear? Brings Love in truth a bitterness to blight The yet unstricken gladness of the year? II Or is it Destiny that doth compel Her hand to stay its blessing? On her right Three virgins, flowerless, slow of step, unite In dance, as they were guided by the spell Of some Choragus imperceptible: Beside them Hermes lifts his wand to smite An orange from the bough; they keep in sight The severing of the golden fruit for hell. What boots it therefore that so light of breath Comes Flora, from her lapful tossing flowers, Come Zephyrus and fleeing nymph, if these Are travelling wanton toward the infernal powers; If the stern Moirai move beneath the trees With eyes fixed on the harbinger of death? APOLLO AND MARSYAS PERUGINO The Louvre Fair stands Apollo, Magnanimous his figure sways: He deigns to follow The brutish notes that Marsyas plays; And waits in haughty, vengeful peace, One hand on his hip, While the fingers of the other quietly slip Round a staff. He does not raise His eyes, nor move his lip. Breeze-haunted tresses, Worn proudly, float around his head; His brow confesses No wrath—and yet a sky grows dead And silent thus, when fatal bolts Treasure up their might Underneath its secret and attentive light. Lifted by a cord of red His lyre hangs full in sight. His face supremely Is set against the lucid air; And, as is seemly, Round Marsyas' straining skull the bare Knolls of the vale are dominant. Waters spread their way By yon bridge and towers, developing the gay Sunshine-blueness everywhere: The god is bright as they. Although his colour Is of an ivory-olive and His locks are duller Than his pale skin, that, scarcely tanned, Flushes to carmine at the knee,— Gracious, heavenly wit From his members such effulgence doth emit, Mortals must admiring stand Simply for awe of it. Unapprehending, Absorbed, the brown, inferior man, On his tune spending All honest power, believes he can Put the young shepherd-god to shame. Scrutinise and hate His spiritless brows, the red down on his pate, The diligent eyes that scan His fingers as they grate! The landscape spreadeth In clarity for many a mile; No light it sheddeth Through stream and sky upon the vile, Painstaking herdsman at his task. Summer brings no ease, He misses the glow on the olive-green trees: A gyrfalcon stoops meanwhile A wild duck's head to seize. Wood-nightshade shooting Purple blossom and yellow spark, Or scarlet fruiting, By Marsyas' uncouth limbs we mark, Where anxious and infirm he sits; The poet's feet are placed On a soil rich-flowering violets have enlaced And the daphne-bush springs dark Behind his loins and waist. To end the matter, He gives an ear to the abhorred Strains of the satyr, Counting it worthy to afford Grace to so confident a skill; For he first did try His strength and the rival did not fetch a sigh: Lo, his rich-wrought heptachord In silence he laid by. Shame and displeasure— The god of inspiration set To hear a measure Of halting pace! But he will whet A knife and without comment flay The immodest faun, Fearing poets should, indifferent through scorn, License all that hinds beget Or zealots feeble-born. There is a sadness Upon the lids, the mouth divine; He loathes the badness Of what disturbs his senses fine, But calmly sorrows, not that doom Should harry ill-desert, But that the offender callous, unalert To contempt or threatening sign, So grossly must be hurt. THE BLOOD OF THE REDEEMER GIOVANNI BELLINI The National Gallery Sunrise is close: the upper sky is blue That has been darkness; and the day is new, Bleaching yon little town: where the white hue, Spread blank on the horizon, skirts The night-mass there is strife and wavy rush Of beams in flush. But, as the amber-spotted clouds unroll, One stands in shade of a dark aureole; His deeply-folded loin-cloth and His whole Wan body by the changing air Made spectral, though the very wounds we see Of Calvary. Is He indeed the Christ? Those transverse beams Of yon high cross confine Him not; it seems Simply a token. Walking as in dreams He has paced onward and holds forth Indifferent His pierced palm: O Life, O Clay, Our fears allay! But to the people wert Thou crucified; To eyes that see, behold, Thou dost abide Dying for ever. Thus Thine Eastertide Breaks over Thee,—the crown of thorn Laid by, but the whole breaking heart in quick Sorrow and sick. The dawn is blue among the hills and white Above their tops; a gladness creeps in sight Across the silver-russet slopes, but night Obscures the mortal ebb and flow Flushing Thy veins; Thy lips in strife for breath Are full of death. For Thou art bleeding, bleeding; we can trace Naught but a dizzy sickness in Thy face; Thine eyes behold us not, yet round the place Whence flows Thy blood Thy conscious palm With fervour of unbated will doth cling, Forcing its spring. Thou standest not on earth, but raised apart On a stone terrace, rich in cunning art; Behind Thee, figures, diligent to start An altar-flame, in low relief Are traced on tablets of a marble ledge At the floor's edge. Blithe Pagan youths sculptured behind Thee go Processional to sacrifice; some blow A horn, some feed the censer, none can know What he should do; but Thou dost give Thyself and consecrate their rites, how vain, O Lamb fresh slain! Is it Thy Father's house, this pavement rare Of chequered marbles, pale and brown, and there For Thy belovèd thus must Thou prepare A place?—Across the burnished floor, Save that an uplift urn its stream hath stopped, Thy blood had dropped. Once crucified and once given to the crowd, But to Thy Church for aye a Victim vowed, Thou dost not die, Thy head is never bowed In death: we must be born again; Thus dying by our side from day to day Thou art the Way. An angel kneels beside, in yellow sleeves And robe of lovely, limpid blue; he heaves With steady hand a chalice that receives The torrent of the precious blood. His ruddy hair, crisp, rising from the roots, Falls in volutes. Was he the angel bidden to infuse Strength, when the Saviour yearned and could not choose To drink the cup?—He has bright, scarlet shoes, Plumes lit by the jay's piercing blue, Yet kneels distressful service to perform By this gaunt form. One thing they have alike; the curls that fleck The angel's temples in profusion deck His Master's, silken on the staring neck. Marred Son of Man, Thou once wert fair As Israel's ruddy King who faintest thus: Thou drawest us. There is no light athwart these eastern skies For us, no joy it is that Thou dost rise— Our hope, our strength is in Thy sacrifice: To-day, to-morrow must Thou die, For ever drawing all men to Thy feet, O Love most sweet! THE SLEEPING VENUS GIORGIONE The Dresden Gallery Here is Venus by our homes And resting on the verdant swell Of a soft country flanked with mountain domes: She has left her arched shell, Has left the barren wave that foams, Amid earth's fruitful tilths to dwell. Nobly lighted while she sleeps As sward-lands or the corn-field sweeps, Pure as are the things that man Needs for life and using can Never violate nor spot— Thus she slumbers in no grot. But on open ground, With the great hill-sides around. And her body has the curves, The same extensive smoothness seen In yonder breadths of pasture, in the swerves Of the grassy mountain-green That for her propping pillow serves: There is a sympathy between Her and Earth of largest reach, For the sex that forms them each Is a bond, a holiness, That unconsciously must bless And unite them, as they lie Shameless underneath the sky A long, opal cloud Doth in noontide haze enshroud. O'er her head her right arm bends; And from the elbow raised aloft Down to the crossing knees a line descends Unimpeachable and soft As the adjacent slope that ends In chequered plain of hedge and croft. Circular as lovely knolls, Up to which a landscape rolls With desirous sway, each breast Rises from the level chest, One in contour, one in round— Either exquisite, low mound Firm in shape and given To the August warmth of heaven. With bold freedom of incline, With an uttermost repose, From hip to herbage-cushioned foot the line Of her left leg stretching shows Against the turf direct and fine, Dissimilar in grace to those Little bays that in and out By the ankle wind about; Or that shallow bend, the right Curled-up knee has brought to sight Underneath its bossy rise, Where the loveliest shadow lies! Charmed umbrage rests On her neck and by her breasts. Her left arm remains beside The plastic body's lower heaves, Controlled by them, as when a river-side With its sandy margin weaves Deflections in a lenient tide; Her hand the thigh's tense surface leaves, Falling inward. Not even sleep Dare invalidate the deep, Universal pleasure sex Must unto itself annex— Even the stillest sleep; at peace, More profound with rest's increase, She enjoys the good Of delicious womanhood. Cheek and eyebrow touch the fold Of the raised arm that frames her hair, Her braided hair in colour like to old Copper glinting here and there: While through her skin of olive-gold The scarce carnations mount and share Faultlessly the oval space Of her temperate, grave face. Eyelids underneath the day Wrinkle as full buds that stay, Through the tranquil, summer hours, Closed although they might be flowers; The red lips shut in Gracious secrets that begin. On white drapery she sleeps, That fold by fold is stained with shade; Her mantle's ruddy pomegranate in heaps For a cushion she has laid Beneath her; and the glow that steeps Its grain of richer depth is made By an overswelling bank, Tufted with dun grasses rank. From this hillock's outer heaves One small bush defines its leaves Broadly on the sober blue The pale cloud-bank rises to, Whilst it sinks in bland Sunshine on the distant land. Near her resting-place are spread, In deep or greener-lighted brown, Wolds, that half-withered by the heat o'erhead, Press up to a little town Of castle, archway, roof and shed, Then slope in grave continuance down: On their border, in a group, Trees of brooding foliage droop Sidelong; and a single tree Springs with bright simplicity, Central from the sunlit plain. Of a blue no flowers attain, On the fair, vague sky Adamantine summits lie. And her resting is so strong That while we gaze it seems as though She had lain thus the solemn glebes among In the ages far ago And would continue, till the long, Last evening of Earth's summer glow In communion with the sweet Life that ripens at her feet: We can never fear that she From Italian fields will flee, For she does not come from far, She is of the things that are; And she will not pass While the sun strikes on the grass. A PIETÀ CARLO CRIVELLI Lord Dudley's Collection A mother bent on the body of her Son, Fierce tears and wrinkles around her eyes,— She has open, stiffened lips And an almost lolling tongue, But her face is full of cries: Almost it seems that the dead has done her wrong, Almost it seems in her strife Of passion she would shake the dead to life. His body has been sold For silver and crucified; but He— She laughs—from death He can recover; E'en now whatever He saith shall be: She will win Him, He shall kiss and love her. His body, once blond, is soiled now and opaque With the solemn ochres of the tomb; The thorns on his brow are green And their fine tips folded in (Through the forehead forcing room) By a swathe of the delicate, lifted skin: The half-closed eyes show grey, Leaden fissures; the dead man's face is clay; And though the lips for breath Leave room, there is no breathing, nor are They gaping eagerly; but parted And vacant as a house-door left ajar, From which the owner of the house has started. A loin-cloth many-folded is on his thighs; One hand has fall'n crookt across the hood Of his mother, one is held With awe by the Magdalen, Who darkly has understood From the prayer on the cross, Christ must die for men. That He once made hearts to burn By the way He is touched alone we learn; No beauty to desire Is here—stiffened limb and angry vein And a belt, 'neath the hirsute nipple, Of flesh that, flaccid and dragged from the strain Of the cross, swells the waist with sinuous ripple. Yet there is such subtle intercourse between The hues and the passion is so frank One is soothed, one feels it good To be of this little group Of mourners close to the rank, Deep wounds, as to tend their unclean dead they stoop. How softly falls in a streak Christ's blanched tress toward his Mother's tear-burnt cheek: And how her sleeve of peach That crosses the corpse's grimy gold Gives it lustre! Her dark-hued kirtle Is of the green that clouded sea-pools hold; Her hood takes light like smooth leaves of the myrtle. 'Neath the third halo, wrought on a burnished ground Of leafy stamp, is John's wailing face: He shrieks; but he does not lift The body into the grave: Beside him in noble grace Bows the Magdalen, who, putting forth a brave Hand, 'twixt her finger and thumb Lifts the Redeemer's arm and with a dumb Wonder looks in the hole Scooped by the large, round nail: So they hurt What one loves! Yet about this silent creature's Suppression there is promise; an alert And moving faith prompts the vigilant features. O glorious spring of the brow, simple arch Of the head that once was sunk so low With the outpoured box of nard! O solemn, dun-crimson mass Of hair, on the indigo Of the bodice that in curling wave doth pass! How exquisite, set between This blue and a vest of translucent green, The glimpse of scarlet belt; Or the glow, the almost emerald line, Round the neck where the hood bends over Such faint reds of the mantle as incline To the sorrel-seed or the ripened clover! So it comes to pass that to this reticent And tender woman there is given sight Of Christ new-born from the tomb: The mother sees not her Son In whom her soul doth delight, She knows Him not, nor the work his cross hath done: But to Mary with the sealed Lips and hard patience Jesus is revealed. His mother clasps his form, Craving for miracle and must lack For ever response to her passion: The dead, if indeed we would win them back, Must be won in their own love's larger fashion. THE VIRGIN, CHILD AND ST. JOHN LORENZO DI CREDI Lord Dudley's Collection A spreading strawberry-tree Embowers an altar-throne; Behind its leaves we see Fair waters blue in tone; Sharp rocks confront the stream and soft Summits and misty towers: But sweet Madonna in a croft Is resting, brimmed with flowers. Anemones are here; How sturdily they grow, Their brown-stemmed heads in clear Design against the flow Of the thin current scarce astir! Through scrambling cresses strike Petals of varied lavender In chalice and in spike. The summer light in streams Has fallen where it can stray On the blond girl who dreams So lazily all day. Dropt eyelids of a differing curve, Deep-dinted lips austere, Some curious grace of visage serve, Half-wayward, half-severe. No stain her cheek has got; Its sun-blanch is complete, Save where one little spot Sweats, rosy with the heat. To keep that tender carmine free In lustre, the arbute Shields with a multiplicity Of leaves its crimson fruit. Of corn-flower blue, with gold Her simple dress is sewn, A cloak's cerulean fold About her feet is thrown. The lining of rich orange hue Is visible just where The brilliant and the paler blue Would cruelly compare. Mid windings of her wrap, Her naked child upon The cradle of her lap Blesses adoring John, Whose flimsy, little shirt is tied With lilac scarf; the slim, Gemmed crosier, propped against his side, Is far too long for him. Her scarlet-sandalled foot Soft resting-place has found; Cup-moss and daisy-root Are thick upon the ground Almost as in our English dells: But here is columbine And one of its pellucid bells Doth to the stream incline. How sweet to bless and pray And nothing understand, Warm in the lovely grey Of that illumined land. O boughs that such red berries bear, O river-side of flowers, No wonder Mary nurses there Her Babe through summer hours! L'EMBARQUEMENT POUR CYTHÈRE ANTOINE WATTEAU The Louvre Why starts this company so fair arrayed In pomegranate brocade, Blue shoulder-cloak and barley-coloured dress Of flaunting shepherdess, From shelter of the full-leaved, summer trees? What vague unease Draws them in couples to a burnished boat? And wherefore from its prow, Borne upward on a spiral, amber swirl Of incense-light, themselves half-rose, half-pearl, So languorously doth float This flock of Loves that in degree Fling their own hues as raiment on the sea; While one from brandished censer Flings wide a flame and smoke Diffusive to provoke The heavens to consummation and to spread Refluence intenser Of sun and cool And tempting azure on that bed Of splendour, that delicious, variant pool? I see it now! 'Tis Venus' rose-veiled barque And that great company ere dark Must to Cythera, so the Loves prevail, Adventurously sail. O happy youth, that thus by Venus' guile Is summoned to her fabulous, Her crystal-burnished isle! Her virile votaries are not slack In ceremonious worship: bravely clad In coats of flickering velvet, crimson-greys Of corn-field gold, they leap to give her praise, They grasp long staves, they joy as they were mad, Drawing their dainty Beauties by the waist To that warm water-track. What terror holds these noble damsels back? Alack, what strange distaste Works in their hearts that thus They sigh estranged? What pressure of what ill Turns their vague sweetness chill? Why should they in debate, Beneath the nodding, summer trees, Dissentient dally and defer their fate? Methinks none sees The statue of a Venus set Mid some fair trellis, in a lovely fret Of rose; her marble mien, Secret, imperial, blank, no joy discovers In these uncertain lovers That parley and grow pale: Not one of them but is afraid to sail, Save this firm-tripping dame who chooses The voyage as a queen, Conscious of what she wins and what she loses. Her petticoat of fine-creased white And, oh, her barley-coloured gown, What miracles of silver-brown They work amid the blues and puces! As, full of whimsical delight To mark a sister's half-abashed surrender, Full proudly she doth bend her Arched, amorous eyelids to commend her, Gripping more tight Her slender stave, that she may seem Prompt to descend toward that dead, heated stream. Her lover's face we lack, Bent from us; yet we feel How fervid his appeal, As raised on tip-toe he his lofty dame addresses. Fine streaks of light across his raiment steal; For, though his cap is black, When blossoms of japonica are spread In sunshine, whiter-smiling red Was never seen than glistens on his sleeve. And how his furs flash to relieve His lady's train of chrome! Ah me, how long must these fond gallants blind The fears and waive the light distresses Of the coy girls who stay behind, Nor yet consent to roam Toward that soft, vermeil country far, so very far from home! First of the twain is seen Pale-tressed dame, couched on the grass, her bodice lambent green, Her frilling skirt of salmon and primrose And green of many a flower before it blows Who, pettish in remorse, Awhile her lover's urgent hand refuses, Then rises buoyant on its welcome force. But, see, this third Sweet lady is not stirred, Though at her side a man Half-kneels. Why is he pleading in her ear, With eyes so near That Paradise of light, Where angles of the yellow, open fan And gown the sunken pink Of dying roses rim her bosom's white? Her eyelids are full-drooped, but under The lids is wonder; And, at her skirt, Ah, woe! in pilgrim hood and shirt Dressed whimsical, a cunning Cupid-lad: Soon shall the naked urchin be Plunged in the depths of that cerulean sea Where life runs warm, delicious, limpid, free. So pause the nearer groups: to the land's rim Presses a dim Confluence of hopes and angry amities: ‘Forth to the fairy water, come; thine hand . . . Nay then, by force; it is a god's command And I by rape will bring thee to thy bliss. What, sweet, so slow!’—‘But ere I leave the land Give me more vows; oh, bind thee to me fast; Speak, speak! I do not crave thy kiss. To-morrow. . .’—‘Love, the tide is rising swift; Shall we not talk aboard? Your skirts are wet; If once I lift You in!’—‘Nay, nay, I cannot so forget The statue in the shade, The fountain-trickle by the leafy grot. Might not this mad embarking be delayed An instant?’—‘Dearest, would you cast your lot In that dull countryside, Where men abide Who must be buried? Note the swell Of colour 'gainst the coast.’—‘Then as you please. How strange a story we shall have to tell!’ Two rowers wait; one shoves The boat from shore, her cry From luscious mouth, her bosom lifted high Incite; and one doth wait, With lip that hath full time to laugh And hand on oar, Conclusion of the soft debate. Sudden the foremost of the fulgent Loves Seizes a staff From wanton hand; a thousand flambeaux pour Their plumy smoke upon the kindled breeze That wafts these silken loiterers to submerging seas. Now are they gone: a change is in the light, The iridescent ranges wane, The waters spread: ere fall of night The red-prowed shallop will have passed from sight And the stone Venus by herself remain Ironical above that wide, embrowning plain.</field>
