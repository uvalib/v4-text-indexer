Repetition marks have been ignored. Variations for different voices have been ignored. To the ryght honorable, lorde Russell, your lordeshypps humble orator, Francys Seagar, whyssheth the fauoure of God, increase of honoure, longe lyfe, and prosperous health of bodye and soule. When I had these psalms finished And into Metre brought: To whom I myght, th? dedicate I strayght then me bethought. Amongst all other, youre good lordeshyp Came then into my mynde: As one that in, a greate number I coulde not meter fynde. To whom I myght, them dedycate And it gyue and present: Trusting that your, lordshyp therwyth Wyll not be dyscontent. And partely knowing, your good lordshyp In such thinges to delyte: As vertuous songes, and ghostly psalms As here we shall recyte. Although good Lord, I am not worthy For my degre and state: Unto the hands, of your lordeshyppe These for to dedycate. Yet for as much, as they were sure The doinges, of a Kynge: Dauid the same, whom god doth name A man hys harte lykinge. The fame y? on, your lordeshyppe bruyts Dyd much incorage me: Which fame to tell, dyd feare expell And boulder made me be. Here for to stande, in praysinge your Good lordeshyppe to your face: It myght seame rather, flatterye Waying the tyme and place. Which prayse I thought, here best to couer Wyth the vele of sylence: Then it to vtter, now out of tyme In your lordeshyps presence. But yf your lordeshype, shall it accept And take them in good parte: I shall thinke, it rewarde ynoughe For my payne and desarte. And yf it woulde, your lordeshyp please Wyth the texte them conferre: You shoulde therby, then soone perceaue From it yf that I erre. But where the text, in some places Was doubtfull and obscure: I haue sought helpe, of learned books Because I woulde be sure. I wyll no lenger, your lordeshype lette From readinge of the same: Whych here is done, to Gods honour And the prayse of hys name. Beseching God, your lordeshyppe kepe And in honoure increace: Wyth the good lady, your verteous wyfe Longe here to lyue in peace. Your lordeshyps humble orator Francys Seager. The troubled mynde, at the Lords hande Dothe seake to haue relefe: Callinge to him, hys ayde to sende Shevvinge hys payne and grefe. Psalme lxxxviii. Domine deus salutis mee. O Lorde vpon, whose holy wyll Dependeth my welfare: To call vpon, thy blessed name Sence daye nor nyght I spare. Graunte that y? iuste, &amp; ryght request Of my repentaunt mynde: So perce thyne eares, that in thy syght Some fauoure it maye fynde. My soule (o Lorde, is fraughted full Wyth grefe of folyes past: My restles body, doth consume And death approcheth fast. Lyke vnto those, whose fatall thred Thyne hand hath cut in twayne: Of whom there is no farther bruyte But in theyr graues remayne. Lorde in thy wrath, thou hast me cast Into the pyt of payne: Wherin I mourne, and playne my wo That I byde and sustayne. The burden of, thy wrath and yre Doth me so sore oppresse: And sondry stormes, thou hast me sent Of terroure and dystresse. The faythfull frendes, are from me ?fl?ed And banysht from my syght: And such as I, haue held full deare Hath set my frendeshyp lyght. My durance doth, now styll perswade Of fredom such dyspayre: That by the teares, that payne my harte Myne eye syght doth appayre. Yet dyd I neuer, cease nor slake Thyne ayde for to desyre: Wyth humble harte, and stretched hands For to appease thyne yre. Wherfore dost thou, o Lorde forbeare In the defence of thyne: To shew such tokens, of thy powre In syght of Adams lyne. Wherby eche faynte, and feble harte Wyth faythe maye be so fed: That in the mouth, of thyne elect Thy mercyes myght be spred. The fleshe in earth, that feadeth worms Can not thy loue declare: Nor such set forth, thy fayth as dwell In the lande of dispaire. Thy name no prayse, can haue at all Euen by the mouthe of those: Whom death hath shut, in sylence so As they maye not dysclose. The lyuely voyce, euen of them all That in thys worlde delyght: Nor by the trumpe, that must resound The glory of thy myght. Wherfore I wyll, not cease at all In chefe of my dystresse: To call on thee, tyll that the slepe My wery bones oppresse. And in the morne, early betyme When that the slepe is fledde: Wyth floudds of salte, repentant teares To washe my restles bedde. Wyth in thys mynde, so full of care Burdned wyth payne and grefe: Why dost thou Lorde, appease the thing That should be my relefe. My wretched state, beholde and se Whom death shall strayght assayle: Cast not from thee, thaflycted styll That naught els doth but wayle. The feare so greate, lo of thyne yre Hath trode me vnder fete: The scourges of, thyne angrye hand Hath made death seme full swete. Lyke as the roringe, waues of seas The sonken shyppe surrounde: Great heapes of care, dyd follow me And I no succoure founde. For they whome no, kynde of myschaunce Could from my loue deuyde: Are forced to, my greater grefe From me theyr face to hyde. Beholde and see, the greate goodnes Of god vvho doth sustayne: The myserye, euen of all suche As be in griefe and payne. Psalme. xxxi. In te domine speraui. In thee (O Lorde) haue I trusted Let me not fele the blame: At any tyme, I thee beseche Of dysapoynted shame. But me defende, preserue and kepe Delyuer as I trust: Now through thy might, without y? which There maye no man be iust. Gyue eare o Lorde, and ryd me soone My fortresse before me: In whose defence, thou shalt me saue Yf I defended be. For thou art wonte, alwayes to be My holde and my succoure: And for thy name, then be thou both My guyde and comfortoure. Thou shalt vntangle, and me vnlofe From snares that they haue layde: To take me with, for without thee My selfe I can not ayde. Into thy helpe, and hand I wyll Betake my simple spryte: Thou hast and shalt, delyuer me Most iuste in thy behyght. I haue not one, of them alowed That sets theyr endes in vayne: Myne only hope, both all and some In the doth sure remayne. Let me therfore, (oh Lord) inioye Thy mercyes oft assayde: My troubles for, thou dydst regarde Wherin my lyfe was stayde. Thou hast not suffered, me at all Wyth enmies powre be paynde: But rather hast, thou set at large My stepps that were restraynde. Oh Lorde on me, now pytye take At hand my daunger loo: Myne eyes my lyfe, and eke my fleshe Alas doth frette for woo. Moste of my dayes, and yeares I saye In troubles wasted arre: My str?gth decayeth, my bones do quayle Such myschefe me doth marre. The feare and dred, of many foes Hath made my frendes to swarue: And they to hate me, wyth out cause Of whome I good desarue. I am dyspysd, and cleane forgot As dede in death doth starue: As broken pots, whose shards I saye For nothinge more can sarue. I hearde the people, taulke and saye And threaten woo and stryfe: As though it semde, by one consent I were not worthy lyfe. But yet (oh Lorde) in thee I do Set surely my beliefe: And know thou art, what me befall My God and whole reliefe. My tyme it is, in thyne owne hands Thou knowst what shall insue: Delyuer me, from enmyes powre Whych doth my lyfe pursue. Shew yet thy frendly, countynaunce Unto thy symple slaue: According to, thy natyue ruthe Thou me defend and saue. Let it not be, imputed lorde For a mock vnto me: That in my nede, my ayde and helpe I seake onely at thee. The wycked haue, the mocks &amp; scorns And holde theyr peace in hell: But buryed maye, they all be now Of farther helpe that tell. And let theyr mouths, be sealed vp That vse theyr lyppes to lyes: Speakinge slanders, of the iuste man Wyth proude dysdaynfull cryes. What welth and what, abundant store Haste thou layde vp for those: That honoure thee, that hope in thee For whome thou doste dysclose. Euen manyfest, afore oure eyes Full many a noble dede: That Adams lyne, maye wondre much And learne thee for to drede. Thou dost bestowe, them wondrous well Afore thyne eyes and face: Whyche is debard, from wycked men They maye not haue that grace. For thou dost them, defende and saue From threates of myghty poure: From venym tounges, thou dost th? hyde Wythin thy pleasaunt boure. Lorde of thy greate, goodnes haue I At thy hand fauoure founde: Thy workes in my, defence is as A cytye walled rounde. I haue me thought, often ere thys Farre cast out of thy syght: But yet euen then, thou hardst my voyce And prayer daye and nyght. Loue ye therfore, the lyuinge Lorde Hys goodnes whych do taste: For he the symple, doth defende Rewards the proude as faste. Be of good cheare, all ye therfore That hope of God good turne: For he wyll strengthen, styll youre harts That trust in hys returne. Dauid afore, the face of God Doth here hys synnes confesse: Vpon vvhose ayde, hys hope is stayed vvhen troubles him oppresse. Psalme. Li. Miserere mei Deus. O Lorde for thy, great mercyes sake Haue thou mercy on me: For thy goodnes, do cleane away My great Impuritie. My mysdeades Lord, put quyte awaye And eftsones make me cleane: From synne, and all iniquytye Thee for to serue agayne. For I acknowledge, and confesse My faults done vnto thee: And myne offence, is neuer from The presence of myne eye. To thee O Lorde, euen I to thee Haue done thys sore offence: In thys mysdede I shew my faute Not fearing thy presence. But yf thou wilt, vouchsafe O Lord Of this me now to ease: And gyue thy worde, now vnto me I shall not thee dysplease. Then shalt thou be, for it named A God bothe iust and true: Moste constant in, thy promysses Not chaunginge them anew. Yea then shalt thou, be reputed And counted Iust in dede: Condemnynge them, that wyll not turne And call for helpe at nede. All things to thee, is full well knowne And nothinge from the hyd: Euen howe of synne, I had no lack When I was conceyued. For why? subiect, my mother was Also to it made thrall: and when that I, conceyued was By her I had my fall. Yea Lord though that, it were not small Whych by her then I had: Yet in thy truth, is my delyte Wyth wysdome make me glad. Yf thou (Oh Lord,) wylt me now clense And purge me from my synne: Wyth Isope washt, I shall be cleane A new lyfe to begynne. Yf thou wilt put, now cleane awaye My synne and me renewe: Then shall I be, that was once black As whyte as is the snewe. When thou wyth ioye, shalt me indew And drawe to myrth agayne: Then wyll my bones, be voyde of woo Whych thou some tymes dydst payne. Thy face good Lord, for thy name sake Do turne from myne offence: And for thy mercyes, great I craue Preserue me now from thence. Oh Lord make cleane, my harte I saye That I in me reserue: And that thy spiryte, within my breast Alwaye maye me preserue. For thy mercy, and greate goodnes Forsake me not (oh Lord): Ne take awaye, thy blessed spyryt Lest that I be abhorde. But rather graunte, thou vnto me The comforte of thyne hande: And wyth thy spyryt, as pryncypall Defend me to wythstande. Yf thou wylt graunte, this my request Then synners shall I tell: Theyr lyfe how that, they shall appoynte In ioye wyth the to dwell. And suche as then, be ouerthroune And thrall to synne be made: They shall repent, and turne agayne Be seinge of my trade. Oh God the author, of my health From murder make me fre: Thy ryghteousnes, my mouth shall tell And prayse it certaynlye. My tounge o Lord, do thou releace Wherof thou hast the cure: That then it may, declare abrode Thy prayse and eke thy poure. Yf that I should, my selfe apply In presence for to brynge: The outwarde sacryfyce, oh Lorde It would please the nothinge. Ne yet wylt thou, ought it regarde As though thou hadst respect: The offering that, the heate doth purge Whych we to thee diect. The sacryfyce, pleasinge the Lorde And the oblacyon: It is the spyryt, ryghte penitent That maketh her great moone. It is truly, the heart of trouthe Wyth doloure strycken sore: Thou c?st not Lord, dispyse these twayne No not for euermore. To Syon Lorde, alwayes declare Thy grace and greate goodnes: That the walles of, Ierusalem Agayne may haue redresse. The sacryfyce, we then shal make Shalbe pleasaunte to thee: Whych shal declare, as tokens trew Oure inwarde purytie. I meane here the, purged offrynge And eke oblacyon: On aulters when, we calues shall laye Thy name to call vpon. vve are here taught, to feare the Lorde And not him to prouoke Lest that vve fele, for our desartes Hys plague and heauy stroke Psalmes. C.xii. Beatus vir qui timet. The man is blest, that feareth God And walketh in hys waye: That in hys lawe, hath hys delyght And doth hys wyll obaye. Hys seade on earth, shall prosper well And wondrouslye increase: The faythfull flock, shal be blessed Wyth euerlastinge peace. Hys house wyth rytches, shall abounde Wyth plenty and great store: Hys ryghteousnes shall styl indure And last for euermore. Unto the man, that mercy sheweth And walketh here aryght: From darknes great, shall then appeare Unto hys eyes playne lyght. O happy is, the mercyfull That lendeth lyberallye: And in hys words, is circumspert And speaks aduysedlye. No thinge shall moue, nor him molest Ne yet him greue or payne: The memory, of the ryghteous For euer shall remayne. No feare can make, him faynt at all Nor no kynde of myschance: Whose harte doth fermly, trust in God In whom he hath affiance. His harte so sure, is stablyshed He wyll not shrynke at all: Untyll he haue his enmyes made To hym subiecte and thrall. He hathe hys goods, abrode dysparst And gyuen to the poore: Hys ryghteousnes, remayne it shall And dure for euermore. The wycked and the vngodlye Shall it beholde and se: And wyll conceaue dyspleasure then And sore offended be. They shall for it, gnashe with theyr teath And vanyshe quyte awaye: And all their desyre, and their wyll Shall peryshe and decaye. To God for ayde, vve ought to call In all aduersitie: For he our prayers vvyll accept And helpe vs spedelye. Psalme. C.XXX. De profundis clamaui. Out of the deape, I haue called My grief (Oh Lord) shewyng: Lord hear the voyce, of my request Geue eare to my callynge. O let thyne eares, enclyned be To waye the words right wel: Of this my voyce, and my complaynte That I shew forth and tell. Yf thou (O Lorde) wylte be extreme And deale with vs this waye: To marke what we, shall do amysse Abyde it Lorde who maye. Yet mercy Lord, there is with thee In suche abundant store: For whiche thou shalt, be dred and feard Bothe now and euermore. The Lords commynge, my soule abydes And wayte wyll for it iust: For in his lawe, is my delyte And in his worde my trust. My soule to the Lorde, takes his flyght Before the mornynge tyde: From day to day, my soule I saye For the Lorde doth abyde. O Israel, trust in the Lorde With whome there is mercy: Whiche of redempcion, hath suche store As call we may plentye. For he the people, of Israel Wyll then redeme I saye: From all the synnes, and wickednesse: Of their deuyce and waye. The Lorde to prayse vve are stirred And hym to magnifye: vvhiche doth vvith grace, al such indevv As trust in hys mercy. Psalme. Cxxxviii. Confitebor tibi. I wyll geue thanks, to thee O Lord Wyth heart &amp; mynde alwayes: Before the Gods, wyll I reioyce and syng vnto thy prayse. I wyll drawe neare, thyne holy place Thy great goodnes recorde: Thy name to prayse, and thee worshyp For thy truths sake, O Lorde. When I dyd call, vpon thy name My voyce thou hardst with spede: And dydst sucker, sende to my soule In the tyme of my nede. Thy name by thy, most glorious powre Thou hast so magnifed: And thy most holy, and blessed worde Aboue all thynges extolled. The Kyngs and rulers on the earthe Shal thee honour and prayse: For they the wordes, of thine owne mouth Haue hearde in all their dayes. Yea they shall synge, and muche reioyce And in thy wayes accorde: That great is the, glory and powre Of thee theyr God and Lord. The Lorde fr? heauen, doth cast hys eyes vpon the lowely sect: As for the proude, he doth dyspyse And them cleane out reiect. Though sorowe and care, do me compas And trouble me oppresse: Yet shalt thou by, thy powre and myght Me strayght agayne refreshe. Thou shalt stretch forth, thy hand on them The furiousnes confounde: Of myne enmyes, and thy ryght hande Shall kepe me safe and sounde. The Lorde hys promys, wyll performe Of hys greate goodnes sure: Thy mercy Lorde, that is so greate For euer doth indure. Dyspyse not then, we the desyre Nor do not Lorde forsake: The worckm?shyp, of thyne owne hands For thou Lorde dydst vs make. This Psalme the vvayes, of the vvycked And the vngodly trayne: Doth by theyre frutes iudge them to be Most damnable and vayne. Psalme. Cxl. Eripe me. Delyuer Lorde, me from the wayes Of people here peruerte: And from suche men, do me preserue As be of wycked heart. Whych styll vpon, myschiefe do muse And in theyr hartes imagen: To styr vp stryfe, and make debate All daye playinge thys pagen. Theyr toungs they whet, lyke to serpents Theyr poysone out to poure: Whych hydden is, vnder theyr lyps Lyke vnto the addoure. From the hands of, the vngodlye O Lorde do thou me saue: Whose whole deuyce, is to confound And my doinges depraue. The proude thinking, for to preuayle Theyr snares abrode do laye: And set theyr net, me into get To trap me in my waye. Unto the Lorde, I forthwyth spake Sayinge my God thou art: Lorde hear the voyce, of my request And prayer of my harte. O God my strength, and fortytude That health to me dost sende: In the daye of, my most daunger Thou dydst me then defende. O Lorde let not, the vngodly Haue theyr desyre and wyll: Lest they wyth pryde, be puffed vp Because they prosper styll. Let such myschiefe, as they imagen Theyr owne dystruccyon be: As theyr owne lyps, shall then pronounce Seakynge to compas me. Let flamyng fyre, them strayght consume Wherin they byding payne: As in a pyt, from whence I saye Neuer to ryse agayne. The man whose lyps, are ryfe in taulke And can hys tounge not gyde: Shall not inioye, the earth no space Theron for to abyde. Myschiefe shal moue, the wycked man Him to molest and noye: And to pursue, vntyll such tyme He shall hym cleane dystroye. The Lord doutles, the pore mans wrong Reuenge wyll and redresse: The cause of such, mayntayne he wyll As here shall be helples. The ryghteous shall, therat reioyce Praysing thyne holy name: The iust wyth ioye, contynew shall In thy syght wythout blame. To God he cals, him to assyst And hys grace to him sende: Hys harte to direct, in hys vvayes And from euel him defende. Psalme C.xli. Domine clamaui. O Lorde I call, to thee for helpe Wyth spede geue eare to me: The voice consydre, of my request When I crye vnto thee. Let thys my prayer, be acceptable As incence in thy syght: Let the lyftynge, vp of my hands Be sacrifyce for nyght. So gyde my lyps, and rule my mouthe O Lorde prepaire a watche: To kepe my tounge, from that speakyng Wherby I may harme catch. My harte to gouerne, I thee beseche And eke so gyde and rule: That it be not, inclyned to The thinge wycked and euel. Let me, the fellowshyppe forsake Of the vngodly sect: Lest that I taste, and such thinges do As they shall well accept. Let me rather, the ryghteous scourge Abyde and eke sustayne: Frendlye to chasten, and me reproue My folly to refrayne. Let not theyr swete, &amp; pleasaunt talke Nor yet theyr flattring style: In me take place, for whych I praye Lest they should me begyle. Let theyr iudges, be put to foyle Wyth stones them ouerthrowe: That they my words, whiche are so swete Maye then heare and them knowe. Oure bones in pyts, lye dyspersed The graues do them retayne: As when we woode, on the earth heaw A memory wyll remayne. Myne eyes O Lorde, do the beholde And haue to thee respect: In thee is my, whole hope and trust My soule do not reiect. From the deuyce, and wyly snares O Lorde delyuer me: Of such as waulke, in wycked wayes Worckinge iniquytye. Such as shall seake, vs to betraye And laye for vs a snare: Let them be taken, in the same For vs they dyd prepare. Dauid to God, makes here request And opens thys hys mynde Hys troubles all dysclosynge playne And douts not helpe to fynde Psalme CXlii. Voce mea ad dominum. My voyce &amp; prayer, I dyd shew forth Makyng to God my mone: Euen to the Lorde, direct dyd I My supplicacion. I dyd powre out, my grefe and playnte Before hys glorious face: And my whole trouble, I dysclosed To hys most deuyne grace. When payne my spyryt, dyd sore oppresse My wayes to thee were knowne: In which myne enmyes, layde th? wayte Me to haue ouerthrowne. I cast myne eyes, on the ryght hande A vew and syght to take Not one ther was, that woulde me know They all dyd me forsake No place of refuge, nor succour Unto had I to flye: As for my soule, not one ther was That would it then pyttye. Unto the Lorde, I spake and sayde My voyce to him lyftinge: Thou art my hope, and porcyon eke In the lande of lyuynge. Waye and consyder, well therfore Thys my complaynt and crye: For very lowe, I am now brought Sustaynynge myserye. Delyuer Lorde, me from the hands Of such as me pursue: Whose myght &amp; strength, is now so great As wyll me cleane subdue. My soule out of, prisone delyuer Releace O Lorde the same: That I maye gyue, &amp; render thankes Unto thyne holy name. Which thynge O Lord, yf thou performe And grauntest vnto me: All the righteous, then resort wyll Unto my company. Dauid of hys sonne, afflycted Doth vnto the Lorde crye From his hands to, be delyuerd And from hys tyrannye. Psalme. C.xliii. Domine exaude. O Lorde gyue eare, to my request Consydre my desyre: For thy truth, &amp; ryghtousnes sake Heare me I thee requyre. And wyth thy seruaunt, entre not In iudgement we the praye: In thy syght no, lyuyng man shall Be iustyfed I saye. The enmye doth, me styll molest My soule he hath pursued: Prostrate on earth, he hath me layde And my lyfe cleane subdued. He hath me throwne, in great darknes And caste me in a caue: Lyke vnto those that are hence gone. And lye in pyt or graue. My spyrite in me is sore vexed Abydynge payne and griefe: My harte in me, is desolate Wantynge helpe and reliefe. I call to mynde, the tyme hence paste Upon thy works I muse: In suche as thyne, owne hands haue wrought My selfe in dayly vse. My hands I do, lyfte vp to thee My soule doth for helpe craue As the grounde thirstynge, for moysture Desyres water to haue. With spede (O Lorde) geue eare to me My spirite it waxeth faynte: From me, O Lorde, hyde not thy face But heare this my complaynte. Lest that I be, to suche comparde And lykend to for it: As are from hence, downe discended To the infernall pyt. O Lord beholde, that art my trust The state wher in I stande: Early in the, mornynge wyll I Loke for helpe at thy hande. My soule O Lorde, I do lyft vp And directe vnto the: The waye wherin, that I shall walke Shewe thou Lord vnto me. From the hands, of myne enemyes O Lorde do me defende: For vnto thee, do I now flye Helpe Lorde vnto me sende. The thinge to do, that shal thee please O God do me instruct: Thy lyuynge sprite, me to the lande Of righteousnes conduct. For thy name, and righteousnes sake O Lorde reuyue my sprite: My soule from all, aduersytie Ryd and delyuer quyte. Distroye thou Lorde, myne enemyes That are to mischiefe prest: The soule of me, thy poore seruaunte, They styll vex and molest. Out of the mouth, of vvicked men Doth vvickednes procede: Theyr due revvarde they shal receaue Accordynge to theyr dede. Psalme. C.xliij. Benedictus dominus. Blessed be the Lord, my refuge My whole powre str?gth &amp; myght: y? doest instructe, my hands to warre And my fyngers to fight. That art my hope, and fortytude My buckler and defence: Subduinge people, vnder me My trust and confydence O Lorde, what is man in thy syghte That thou taks such respecte: Unto his wayes, and dost so much Hym esteme and accept. The state and lyfe, of man may we Repute to be as vayne: Whose tyme lyke shadowe fades away Renewynge not agayne. Bowe downe thyne heauen, from thence discende To such as thee prouoke: The mountains touch, wherby thy powre Shal forthwith make them smoke. Caste forth thy lyghtnynge, them to feare In thy great wrath and fume: Out of thy bowe, thyne arows shote Therby them to consume. Lord fr? aboue, thy hande downe stretche Thy helpe to me nowe sende: From the daunger, of the wycked By thy powre me defende. Whose mouth doth speake, all vanitie No truth is founde therin: Their ryght hande is, an instrument To commyt greuouse synne. I wyll synge vnto thee, O God Upon the lute alwayes: A newe songe soundinge, on ten stryng?s? Thy name to laude and prayse. That vnto the, kynges on earth Dost gyue the vyctorye: Thy seruaunt Dauid, hast saued From all his ioberdye. From the powre, of the vngodly O Lorde delyuer me: Whose hands to do, mischiefe are prest Their lyps talke vanytye. Graunte that our sons, may grow and crease As younge plants on y? grounde: Oure doughters to, be pure and cleane Wyth verteous to abounde. That our garnars, of corne may be replenysht with greate store: Our shepe and cattayle, to increase In numbre more and more. That scarsnes do, them not oppresse The oxe for laboure stronge: No cause to vse, imprys?ments Nor complaynynge of wronge. Happy maye we, all suche repute And iudge them of that sorte: To be blessed, that haue the Lorde For theyr God and comforte. Hovve iuste the Lorde, is of hys vvorde This psalme doth here recyte: His goodnes greate, and mercye bothe His glory and hys myght. Psalme. C.xlvi. Exaltabo te deus. O God I wyll, thee magnifye My Lorde and Kyng always: For euermore, I wyll thy name Honour laude &amp; eke prayse. Eche daye by daye, I wyll geue thanks Unto thy maiestye: And thy name prayse, for euermore Lord for thy great mercy. Thy myght O Lorde, is maruelous And worthy of much prayse: Thy powre O Lorde, is infinite And dure it wyll alwayes. One generacion, vnto an other Shall thus saye and recorde: Praysynge thy works, &amp; shewe therby The powre of thee, their Lorde. And as for me, I wyll not cease But tell of thy glorye: Of thy worshyp, and wonderous works Thee for to magnifye. All men shall speake, of thy great powre And thy maruelous actes: I wyll shewe forth, and tel abrode Of all thy noble factes. A memory, of thy mercy I wyll shewe and expresse: So that men shall, vnto thee synge Of thy righteousnes. The Lords goodnes, is wondrous great Whose grace is most plentye: Longe sufferynge, our wickednes And abounds with mercy. The Lorde our God full louyng is Unto eche creature: Ouer his worcks, his mercy is And wyll euer indure. All thy worcks of, wondre O Lorde Thee prayse and magnifye: And al thy saints, do render thanks Unto thy maiestie. The glory great, of thy kyngdome They do shewe and expresse: And all their taulke, is for to tell Of thy powre and goodnesse. That thereby thy, glory and powre Maye forth abrode be blowen: And the greatnes, of thy kyngedome Myght to all men be knowen. Thy kyngedome is, euerlastynge For euer to remayne: And dure shal thy, dominion In all ages to rayne. The Lorde forgetteth, not the state Of those that go astraye: But rayseth vp, suche as are downe To brynge them to his waye. The eyes here of, all lyuynge thyngs On thee O Lorde attende: And thou their meate, in due season Dost then vnto them sende. Thy greate goodnes, thou dost extende When thy hande thou opnest: Eche thynge lyuynge, with plenteousnes With thy blessynge thou fyllest. The Lord our God, in all his wayes Is iuste and righteous bothe: And holy is, in all his works The witnes of his trothe: Suche as vpon, the Lord do call Shewynge theyr payne and griefe: He dothe pyttye, their myserye And ease them wyth reliefe. The Lorde the desyre, wyll fulfyll Of suche as do hym feare: At nede he shal, ayde to them sende And wyl their prayer heare. The Lord wyll sure, defende all suche As do hym feare and loue: But the wycked, he wyll dysparse And their doynges reproue. My mouth O Lord, for euermore Shall speake vnto thy prayse: All creatures to, thyne holy name Shall render thanks alwayes. To put oure truste, onely in God vve are here playnly taught: And hym to prayse, for all his vvorks That heauen and earth hath vvrought. Psalme. Cxlvi. Lauda Anima mea. The Lorde to prayse, and magnifye My soule se thou accorde: Duryng the tyme, I here abyde I wyll prayse thee O La?rde. So longe as lyfe, in me shall laste And eke shall dure my dayes: Unto the Lorde, I wyl not cease To synge vnto hym prayse. In Princes put; not confydence Nor in no chylde of man: For they are voyde, euen of all ayde But the Lorde thee helpe can. When death shall lyfe, from the body Dissolue here of eche man: His thoughts shall peryshe, &amp; he returne To earth where he began. The man is blessed, and happy Whome Iacobs God doth ayde: And he whose hope, and confydence Upon the Lorde is stayed. Whiche did the heauen, the earth and sea And all that therein is: Fasho?n? and make, and doth styll kepe For euer his promyse. Which wil to right, all them restore That suffer iniurye: And doth agayne, prouyde to fede Suche as be hungerye. The Lorde wyl lose, and eke delyuer Suche as in pryson be: And to the blynde, syght dothe restore Of them that can not se. The Lorde dothe helpe, vnto such sende As fall and go astraye: As for the iuste, and ryghteouse sorte He taketh care alwaye. The Lorde the state, of straungers doth Regarde and esteame muche: The wyddowe, and the fatherlesse Defende he wyll all suche. As for the wayes, of the wycked The Lorde full well doth knowe: But he wyll turne, it vpse downe And them cleane ouerthrowe. The Lord thy God, O Syon shall Be gyde of all nacions: And shal be kynge for euermore Thorowout all generacions. THE povver of God, here se vve may His vvorks and vvhat they be: His glorye greate, and vvysedome pure Hys myght and maiestie. Psalme C.xlvii. Laudate Dominum. O prayse the Lorde, for it is good To synge vnto hym prayse: Unto the tyme, I here abyde I wyll prayse thee O Lorde. In the syght of, the Lorde it is Most pleasaunt and ioyfull: For all suche gyfts as we receaue To be for them thankfull. The Lorde of hys, goodnes hath buylte Agayne Ierusalem: And the outecasts, of Israell Together chosen them. The Lorde wyl them, of contrite heart?e? To health agayne restore: For he medcyns, wyl geue to cure Their sicknes and their sore. The stars in numbre, he doth knowe Iustlye countynge the same: And at hys pleasure, calleth them In ord?er? by they?r? name. The maiestie, of thee our God And thy great power and myghte Is wonderfull, and all thy works Thy wysdome infinite. The Lorde the lowly, lyfteth vp And doth exhault the meke: As for the proude, he pulleth downe And the vngodlye eke. O synge vnto, the Lorde therfore With laude and thanks geuynge: Upon the harpe, vnto our God To hym let vs prayse synge. Which doth the heauen, w? cloudes couer And by hys power ordayne: The earthe to serue, when nede requirs In his due tyme with rayne. Wherby the grasse, doth grow &amp; spryng?e? Upon high mountaynes than: The earthe it maks, to bringe forth herbs To serue the vse of man. Whiche for catell, fodder prouids By power celestiall: And the yong Rauens, lykwyse doth fede When they vpon hym call. The Lorde taks no, pleasure at all In the strength of an horse: Neyther delyghts he in mans legs Nor in hys myght and force. Suche as do feare, and dred the Lorde In those delyghteth he: And taketh pleasure, in all them That trust in hys mercye. Laude and prayse O, Ierusalem The Lorde that is on hye: O Syon se, thou prayse thy God And do hym magnifye. For he thy ga?et?s, so sure hathe made And with bars them so bounde: All the chyldren, he hath blessed That may in thee be founde. The whole borders, thorowe out he doth With peace indue and blysse: And with great aboundaunce of wheate He doth it replenyshe. He sendeth forth, vpon the earth Hys commaundment to vs: Hys worde it is, of race so swift As cal we may wondrous. By deuine powre he geueth snowe On earth lyke vnto wooll: And the hoare froste, lyke to ashes The grounde he scatters full. The yse abrode, he doth disparse In peces to remayne: Thy frost so colde, who is able To abyde and sustayne. When he commaundeth, by hys worde It then dissolues agayne: And by the powre, euen of hys wynde The waters flowe amayne. Hys lyuely worde, vnto Iacob He doeth vtter and tell: Hys lawes and hys, ordinaunces He sheweth Ilsraell. He hath not so, louingly dealt With any other nacion: For in hys lawes, are ignoraunt The Heathen congregacion. The iust vvith ioye, maye here reioyce In God vvho doth regarde: Their lovvely meke and contrite hearts Full vvell he vvyll regarde. Psalm C.xlix. Cantare Domino. O synge to the Lorde, a newe songe Thy voyce to hym direct: Let the whole company prayse hym Of the saincts and elect. Let Israel, in hys maker Be glad with thanckfull voyce: Let all the chyldren, of Sion In their kynge much reioyce. Hys name to laude and magnifie In all their daunce and playes: Upon the ?t?abret, and the harpe Let them synge to hym prayse. Let the sayncts and, all the elect Reioyce with great glorye: Let them be ioyfull, and ryght glad In their beds where they lye. Let all the words, they shall vtter Sounde to the prayse of God: And in their hands, a two edge sworde For the wicked a rod. To be auengd, on the Heathen That peruerse generation: Puttynge the people, to reprofe To shame and great vexacion. To subdue their, kyngs and rulers And nobles of their lands: Castynge them, in captiuitie Into stronge yron bandes. That they on them, may be auengd Euen as it is wrytten: Suche honour haue, all the elect From the Lorde aboue geuen. The sure hope, truste, and confidence That he had on the Lorde: Is here exprest, and manifest As thys Psalme doth recorde. Psalme. C.xliii. Iudica me Deus. Gyue sentence on, my syde O God And eke my cause defende: Agaynst people, that are peruert And to me hurt intende. Delyuer Lorde, me from the man Whose doynges are vniust: Whose heart is full, of gyle and craft In whome there is no trust. For thou O God, art my defence My strength, my power and myght: Why hast thou put, me quite awaye From presence of thy syght. And why walke I, so heauely As one that is dismayde: Whyle that myne enmy, vexeth me And maks me sore affrayde. Sende forth thy lyght, me for to gyde And thy truth me to tell: They shal me leade, vnto the place Where thou dost byde and dwell. They shall me strayght, and sure conduct Unto thy holye hyll: Where I wyll then, remayne and byde On thy most blessed wyll. Then shall I in, thy presence come With glad and thanckful voyce: Of thee my God, that maks my youth In thee muche to reioyce. O God vpon, the harpe I shall Thee prayse and magnifye: Why art thou heauye, O my soule And dost thus trouble me. In God put trust, and confidence And geue vnto hym prayse: He is my hope, he is my health And eke my God Alwayse. Hovve much God doth the slaundrous man Abhorre hate and dispyse: Is in thys Psalme discribed playne Euen open to oure eyes. Psalme. Lxiiij Exaudi Deus orationeru meam. Heare thys the voyce, of my request O God I call to thee: My lyfe preserue, thou from the feare Now of my ennemye. From the assemble, of people yll Under thy wyngs me hyde: And from the wayes, of the wycked Do me defende and gyde. Their tungs they whet, th? sharpe to make Their poyson out to brynge: Euen venyme words, they powre forth styll That do moste deadly stynge. That they maye priuely, hurt and noye The Iust and the elect: They nothynge feare, for to slaunder The man that is perfect. In mischiefe they, do animate Them selues all that they maye: And do consult, amongst them selues Their snares howe for to laye. And bouldly say, eche to other No man there is at all: That can bewraye, what we wyl do So secret worke we shall. They mischiefe in, their hearts ymagen And that they put in vre: Which they kepe closse amonge th? selues And thynke all safe and sure. But sodaynlye, God shall start vp And them all strayght confounde: With bowe then bent, with arrows prest He shall them depelye wounde. Yea their owne tounges, shalbe the cause That they shall fall and slyde: And all suche as, do them behoulde Shal their doynges deryde. And suche as shall, then se their fall Wyll saye thys is Gods act: For they shall playne, perceyue it all To be hys worcke and fact. The ryghteous shall, in God reioyce And put in hym their trust: The faythfull mynde, shalbe ryght glad Whose heart is true and iuste. THE due revvarde, to lyinge lyps Is here expressed playne: VVhose toungs do vtter, all disceate And do but glose and fayne. Psalme. C.xx. Ad Dominum cum tribularer. When troubles, dyd me sore oppresse And my soule was heauye: Upon the Lorde, I dyd then cal Who hearde me by and by. To whom I spake, and sayde O Lorde Ryd and delyuer me: From lyinge lyps, that speake disceayte And worke all vanitye. O thou false tonge, thy due rewarde Shalt thou haue for thyne hyre: Euen percynge strokes, of Arows kea?n? With hote consumynge fyre. And wo is me, that am constraynd With Mesech for to byde: And in the tentes, of Cedar eke To dwell all my lyfe tyde. My soule longe tyme, in troubels byd That I coulde not releace: Euen amongst such, as loue debate And are enmies to peace. And styll in peace, I seake to lyue Wherin I most delyght: But when I speake, to them therof They are ready to fyght. From God all ayde, and helpe vve haue In our distresse and nede. VVhich vve must aske, and of hym craue Not doubtynge for to spede. Psalme. LXX. Deus in adiutorium. Haste the O God, &amp; make good spede For to delyuer me: Make haste to helpe and me nowe ryd O Lorde I call to thee. Put to reproche, shame and rebuke All that me vexe and noye: And such as seke, after my soule Confounde and them distroye. Let them receaue, for their rewarde Shame that to them is due: With open mouth, they folowe me And cryinge me pursue. And suche as vnto, me wyshe euyll Let them be put to flyght: That seake the way, me to betraye With death confounde them quite. But let all suche, as thee shall seke Reioyce in thee alwayes: That in thy sauynge, health delyghts Sayinge to thee be prayse. But as for me, that am but poore And in great miserye: Yet I wyll for, ayde to thee call Lorde hast thee to helpe me. Prolonge not Lorde, but helpe with spede That hast redemed me: In paryls grate, I Lorde now stand Unlesse I helped be. FINIS. A DISCRIPTION of the lyfe of man, the worlde, and vanities therof.

Who woulde, thys wicked worlde esteme Or ought therin I saye: Sence that we see, all things are vayne And dayly doe decaye. The man the beast, the fishe and foule A tyme here growe and crease: Tyll death with dent, and dart shal come Of lyfe them all release. What shal we count, the lyfe of man But care and miserye: Some tyme in wele, some tyme in wo And aye dreadeth to die. Thys vayne and wretched, lyfe to leaue Why are we then so loth: But that we dout, and deme our dedes Prouoked haue Gods wroth. Thus lyuynge, alwaye dred we death And dyinge lyfe we dout: In doutfull state, we stande both wayes Tyll course of lyfe be out. Yf Fortune shal, vs so fauoure To set vs in hygh state: Why then we dred, and feare the fall And styll we blame our fate. Yf rytches do, with vs increase Therof we feare the losse: If pouertye, shall vs assayll Agayne care doth vs tosse. Thus are we compast, in with care Thus tossed to and fro: As men here voyde, of restyng place Replete with payne and wo. Thus maye we se, what thys worlde is Hys glorye and hys pryde: Nothynge at all, but dreadeth fall For longe it can not byde. What thynge so sure, that maye indure That tyme can it not chaunge: What is so fayre, but tyme maye payre And make it seme as straunge. Behoulde thy selfe, here in thys glasse Thy shape and fashon iuste: From whence thou camst, whether thou shalt And howe thou art but duste. A tyme to lyue, God doth thee gyue And after for thee call: Whiche tyme so lent, beynge well spent The heauens inioye ye shall. This worldly pompe, this vayne pleasure It lasteth but a space: Our eyes to fyll, a tyme it wyll. And then we must geue place. Oure chyldren shall, vs then succede Our place for to supplye: Tyll death dissolue, and then bereue The lyfe from their bodye. Thus doth the worlde, both eb and flowe As commonly doth the tyde: Nowe vp now downe, now to now fro For all hys pompe and pryde. Behoulde, our forefathers are gone: They place to vs dyd gyue: The tyme was come, that Nature set They coulde no lenger lyue. Death hath them all, of lyfe bereft Whose fame in bokes are founde: To oure rebuke, that lyue thys daye In synne we so abounde. Let vs so lyue, then well to dye And dye to lyue agayne: So shal we chaunge, but Naturs course And Gods kyngdome attayne. Thys tyme I can, but much lament In whych synne so doth rayne: No trust no truth, in age nor youth Ech man seaks hys owne gayne. Men nowe to get, their myndes set Not carynge howe it cums: By hooke or crooke, they do not looke So they maye gather sums. But man I saye, thynke on the daye That thou must all forsake: When dredfull death, shal stop thy breath And thy lyfe from thee take. If gredy men, woulde suffre then Thys to synke in their brest: They woulde not moyle, and for that toyle That shoulde brede their vnrest. For their chyldren, their answere is They landes and goods do git: And yet often, it is here sene That they inioye not it. By Fortune it maye so betyde The goods got by their lyfe: Within short space, to be consumd Or els be cause of stryfe. Uayne is thys muck, that here they seake Though happy we them call: That it inioye, and haue at wyll For leaue it here they shall. The final nine stanzas of this text are illegible. ? F. S.
