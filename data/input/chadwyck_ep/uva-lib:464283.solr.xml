      <field name="fulltext">I. [Now peep, boe peep, thrise happie blest mine eies] [1] Now peep, boe peep, thrise happie blest mine eies, For I haue found faire Phillis, where she lies, Vpon her bed, with armes vnspred, all fast a sleepe, Vnmaskt her face, thrise happie grace, farewell, farewell my Sheepe, Looke to your selues, new charge I must approue, Phillis doth sleepe, And I must guard my Loue. 2 Now peep boe peep, mine eyes to see your blisse, Phillis closd eyes atrackts you, hers to kisse: Oh may I now performe my vow, loues ioy t'impart, Assay the while, how to beguile, farewell faint hart. Taken she is, new ioyes I must approue, Phillis doth sleep, and I will kisse my Loue. 3 Now peep, boe peep, be not too bould my hand, Wake not thy Phillis, feare shee doe with-stand: Shee stirs alas, alas, alas I faint in spright, Shee opes her eie, vnhappie I, farewell delight. Awakt shee is, new woes I must approue, Phillis awakes, and I must leaue my Loue. II. [My choice is made and I desire no change] [1] My choice is made and I desire no change, My wandring thoughts in limits now are bound: The deserts wilde wherin my wits did range, Are now made easie walks and pleasant ground: Let him that list sooth humors that be vaine, Till vanitie all meane exceeds, Let passions stil possesse the idle braine, And care consume whom folly feeds. I rest resolu'd no fancies fits can mee estrange, My choice is made, and I desire no more to change. 2 Change they their choice, to whose delicious sence, The strangest obiects are of most esteeme: Inconstant likeing may find excellence, In things which (being not good) yet best doe seeme. Let gallant blouds still crowne their sports with ioy, Whom honor, wealth, and pleasure fils: Let sweet contentment neuer find annoy, While Fortune frames things to their wills. This stirs not mee, I am the same, I was before. My choice is made, and I desire to change no more. 3 Be my choice blamde, or be I thought vnwise, To hold my choice, by others not approued, I say, that to my selfe I fall or rise, By feare, or force I cannot be remoued. Let friends in pittie doubt of my successe, Their pittie gets no thanks at all: Let foes be glad to see my hopes grow lesse, I scorne the worst that wish they shall: Still stand I firme, my hart is set, and shall remaine, My choice is made, and neuer will I change againe. III. [Can she disdaine, can I persist to loue] Can she disdaine, can I persist to loue, Can she be cruell, I subiected still. Time will my truth, compassion hers aproue, Release the thrald, and conquer froward will. I loue not lust, Oh, oh therfore let her daigne, To equal my desires, with like againe. Am I not pleasing in her prouder eies, Oh that she knew Loues power as well as I, Wittie she is, but Loues more wittie wise, She breathes on earth, he Raignes in heauen on high. I loue not lust, oh therefore let her daigne, To equall my desires with like againe. Loue scornes the abiect earth his sacred fires, Vnites diuided mindes disseuers none, Contempt springs out of fleshly base desires, Setting debate twixt loue and vnion. I loue not lust, oh therefore let her daigne, To equall my desires, with like againe. IIII. [Alas faire face why doth that smoothed brow] Alas faire face why doth that smoothed brow: Those speaking eies ros'd lips, and blushing beautie. All in them selues confirme a scornfull vow: To spoile my hopes of loue, my loue of dutie. The time hath bin, when I was better grast: I now the same, and yet that time is past. Is it because that thou art onely faire, Oh no such gracefull lookes banish disdaine, How then, to feede my passions with dispaire, Feede on sweet loue, so I be loued againe. Well may thy publike scorne, and outward pride, Inward affections, and best likings hide. Breath but a gentle aire, and I shall liue, Smyle in a clowde, so shall my hopes renue, One kind regard, and second seing giue, One rising Morne, and my blacke woes subdue. If not, yet looke vpon the friendly Sunne, That by his beames, my beames to thine may runne. V. [Whether so fast, see how the kindly flowres] Whether so fast, see how the kindly flowres, Perfumes the aire, and all to make thee stay, The climing woodbind clipping al these bowrs, Clips thee likewise, for feare thou passe away, Fortune our friend, our foe will not gainesay. Stay, but a while, PhÅbe no teltale is, She her Endimion, Ile my PhÅbe kisse my PhÅbe kisse. Feare not, the ground seekes but to kisse thy feete Harke, harke how Philomela sweetly sings, Whilst water wanton fishes as they meete, Strike crochet time amid'st these christall springs, And Zephirus mongst the leaues sweet murmure rings, Stay but a while, PhÅbe no teltale is, She her Endimion, Ile my PhÅbe kisse. See how the Helitrope hearbe of the Sunne Though he himselfe long since be gon to bed, Is not of force thine eies bright beames to shun, But with their warmth his gouldy leaues vnspred, And on my knee inuites thee rest thy head. Stay but a while, PhÅbe no teltale is, She her Endimion, Ile my PhÅbe kisse. VI. [Rest sweet Nimphs let goulden sleepe] Rest sweet Nimphs let goulden sleepe, Charme your star brighter eie, Whiles my Lute the watch doth keep With pleasing simpathies, Lulla lullaby, Lulla Lullaby, Sleepe sweetly, sleep sweetly, let nothing affright ye, In calme contentments lie. Dreame faire virgins of delight, And blest Elizian groues: Whiles the wandring shades of night, Resemble your true loues: Lulla lullaby, Lulla lullaby Your kisses your blisses send them by your wishes, Although they be not nigh. Thus deare damzells I do giue Good night and so am gone: With your hartes desires long liue Still ioy, and neuer mone. Lulla lullaby, Lulla lullaby Hath pleasd you and easd you, &amp; sweet slumber sezd you, And now to bed I hie. VII. [Aye mee, she frownes, my Mistresse is offended] Aye mee, she frownes, my Mistresse is offended, Oh pardon deare, my misse shall be amended: My fault from loue proceeded, It merits grace the rather, If I no danger dreaded, it was to win your fauour. Then cleere those clouds, then smile on mee, And let vs bee good friends. Come walke, come talke, come kisse, come see, how soone our quarrell ends. Why low'rs my loue, and blots so sweet a beautie, Oh be apeasd with vowes, with faith and duetie: Giue ouer to be cruell, sith kindnesse seemes you better, You haue but changd a Iuell, and loue is not your detter. Then welcome mirth, and banish mone, shew pittie on your louer, Come play, come sport, the thing thats gon no sorrow can recouer. Still are you angry, and is there no relenting? Oh wiegh my woes, be mou'd with my lamenting: Alas my hart is grieued, myne inward soule doth sorrow, Vnles I be releeud, I dye before to morrow. The coast is cleard, her countnance cheard, I am againe in grace. Then farewell feare, then come my deare, lets dallie and embrace. VIII. [Now let her change and spare not] Now let her change and spare not, Since she proues false I care not, Fained loue so bewitched my delight, That still I doated on her sight, But she is gon, New desires imbracing, And my deserts disgracing. When did I erre in blindnesse, Or vex her with vnkindnesse, If my care did attend her alone, Why is she thus vntimely gone? True loue abides till the day of dying, False loue is euer flying. Then false fare-well for euer, Once false proue faithfull neuer, He that now so triumphes in thy loue, Shall soone my present fortunes proue. Were I as faire as diuine Adonis, Loue is not had where none is. IX. [Vnderneath a Cypris shade, the Queene of Loue sat mourning] [1] Vnderneath a Cypris shade, the Queene of Loue sat mourning, Casting downe the Rosie wreaths, Her heauenly brow adorning: Quenching fiery sighes with teares, But yet her hart, still burning. 2 For within the shady mourne, the cause of her complaining, Mirrhas Sonne the leavy bowres did haunt, her loue disdaining, Counting all her true desires, in his fond thoughts but faining. 3 Why is youth with beauty grast, vnfeeleing Iudge of vnkindnesse, Spotting loue with the foule report, of crueltie and blindnesse, Forceing to vnkind complaints, the Queene of all diuinenesse. 4 Stint thy teares faire Seaborne Queene, &amp; greife in vaine lamented, When desire hath burnt his hart, that thee hath discontented, Then to late the scorne of youth, by age shall be repented. X. [Sound wofull plaints in hils and woods] For his vnfortunate friend William Harwood. Sound wofull plaints in hils and woods, Fly my cries, to the skies, Melt mine eies, and hart languish, Not for the want of friends, or goods, Make I moane, though alone, this I groane by soules anguish. Time, friends, chance, goods, might againe recouer, Black woes, sad griefes, ore my life doe houer, Since my losse is with dispaire, No blest Star to me shine faire, All my mirth turne to mourning, Hart lament, for hope is gon: Musick leaue, Ile learne to moane, Sorrowes the sads adorning. Since my, &amp;c. Ayemee my daies of blisse are done, Sorrowing must I sing, nothing can relieue mee: Eclipsed in my glorious Sunne, And mischance doth aduance horrors lance, still to greiue mee. Poore hart, ill happ hath all ioy bereft thee: Gon's the sole good, which the Fates had left mee. Whose estate is like to mine? Fortune doth my weale repine, Enuying my one pleasure, Patience must mee assure, other plaster can not cure. Therefore in this my treasure. XI. [You that pine in long desire] [1] You that pine in long desire, Helpe to cry. Come Loue, come Loue, quench this burning fire. Least through thy wound I die. 2 Hope that tyres with vaine delay, euer cryes Come loue, come loue, howers and yeares decay, In time loues treasure lyes. 3 All the day, and all the night still I call Come loue, come loue, but my deare delight, yealds no releefe at all. 4 Her vnkindnesse scornes my moane, that still shrykes Come loue, come loue, beauty pent alone dyes in her owne dislikes. XII. [Looke Mistresse mine within this hollow brest] Looke Mistresse mine within this hollow brest, See heere in closd a tombe of tender skin, Wherin fast lockt is framd a Phenix nest, That saue your selfe, there is no passage in. Witnesse the wo?d that through your dart doth bleed, And craues your cure, since you haue done the deed. Wherefore most rare and Phenix rarely fine, Behould once more the harmes I do possesse: Regard the hart that through your fault doth pine, Attending rest yet findeth no redresse. For end, waue wings and set your nest on fire, Or pittie mee, and grant my sweet desire. XIII. [Clime O hart, clime to thy rest] To his louing friend M. Holder, M. of Arts. [1] Clime O hart, clime to thy rest, Climing yet take heed of falling, Climers oft euen at their best, Catch loue, downe falth, hart appaling. 2 Mounting yet if she do call, And desire to know thy arrant: Feare not stay, and tell her all, Falling shee will be thy warrant. 3 Rise, oh rise, but rising tell, When her beautie brauely wins thee, T'sore vp where that she doth dwell, Downe againe thy basenesse brings thee. 4 If she aske what makes thee loue her, Say her vertue, not her face: For though beauty doth approue her, Mildnesse giues her greater grace. 5 Rise then rise if she bid rise, Rising say thou risest for her: Fall if she do thee dispise, Falling still do thou adore her. 6 If thy plaint do pittie gaine, Loue and liue to her honor: If thy seruice she disdaine, Dying yet complaine not on her. XIIII. [Thanks gentle Moone for thy obscured light] Thanks gentle Moone for thy obscured light, My Loue and I betraid thou set vs free, And Zephirus as many vnto thee, Whose blasts conceald, the pleasures of the night, Resolue to her thou gaue, content to mee. But be those bowers still fild with Serpents hisses, That sought by treason, to betray our kisses. And thou false A bor with thy bed of Rose, Wherin, wheron toucht equall with loues fyer, We reapt of eyther other loues desire, Wither the triming plants that thee enclose. Oh be thy bowers still fild with serpents hisses, That sought by treason, to betray our kisses. Torne be the frame, for thou didst thankles hide, A trayterous spy, her brother, and my foe, Who sought by death, our ioyes to vnder goe, And by that death, our passions to deuide, Leauing to our great vows, eternall woe. Oh be thy bowers still fild with serpents hisses, That sought by treason, to betray our kisses. XV. [I sigh as sure to weare the fruit of the Willow tree] [1] I sigh as sure to weare the fruit of the Willow tree, I sigh as sure to lose my sute, for it may not bee. I sigh as one that loues in vaine, I sigh as one that liues in paine, Very sorie, very weary of my miserie. 2 I hate my thoughts which like the Flie, flutter in the flame, I hate my teares which drop, and dry, quench and frie the same: I hate the hart which frozen burnes, I hate the hart which chosen turnes, Too and from mee, making of mee nothing but a game. 3 My thoughts are fuell to desire, which my hart doth moue, My teares are oyle to feed the fire, smart whereof I proue: She laughes at sighes that come from mee, I sigh at laughes in her so free, Who doth glory, in the storie of my sorie loue. 4 Her louely lookes, and louelesse mind doe not well agree, Her quick conceipt, and iudgement blind, as ill suted bee: Her forward wit, and froward hart, that like to knit, this glad to part, Makes so prettie, and so wittie, not to pittie mee. 5 The more I seeke, the lesse I find what to trust vnto, The more I hold, the lesse I bind, she doth still vndoe: I weaue the web of idle loue, which endles will, and frutles proue, If the pleasure for the measure of my treasure goe. XVI. [Down a down, Thus Phillis sung] Chorus. Down a down, Thus Phillis sung, By Fancie once oppressed, Who so by foolish Loue are stong, Are worthely distressed, and so sing I, [1] When Loue was first begot, and by the mothers will, Did fall to humane lot, his solace to fulfill, Deuoid of all deceit, a chast and holy fire, Did quicken mans conceit, and womens brest inspire. The Gods that saw the good, that mortals did approue, With kinde and holy moode, began to talke of loue. Chorus. Downe a downe. 2 But during this accord, a wonder strange to heare Whilst loue in deed and word, most faihfull did appeare: False semblance came in place, by Ielocie attended, And with a double face, both loue and fancie blended, Which made the gods forsake, and men from fancie flie, And maidens scorne a mate, forsooth and so will I. Chorus. Downe a downe, &amp;c. XVII. [Diaphenia like the Dafdowndillie] [1] Diaphenia like the Dafdowndillie, White as the Sunne, faire as the Lillie, Heigh ho, heigh ho, how I doe loue thee: I doe loue thee as my Lambs, Are beloued of their dambs, How blest were I if thou wouldst proue mee. I 2 Diaphenia like the spreading Roses, That in thy sweetes, all sweetes incloses, Faire sweete how I doe loue thee? I doe loue thee as each flower, Loues the Sunnes life giuing power, For dead, thy breath to life might moue mee. 3 Diaphenia like to all things blessed, When all thy praises are expressed, Deare ioy, how I doe loue thee? As the birds doe loue the spring, Or the Bees their carefull king, Then in requite, sweete virgin loue mee. XVIII. [Beautie sat bathing by a spring] Beautie sat bathing by a spring, Where fairest shades did hide her: The winds blew calme, the birds did sing, The coole streames ranne beside her. My wanton thoughts entic'd mine eie, To see what was forbidden: But better memory said fie, So vaine desire was chidden. Hey nony, hey nony, hey hey nony no nony nony. Into a slumber then I fell, When fond imagination, Seemed to see, but could not tell, Her feature, or her fashion. But euen as Babes in dreames doe smile, And sometime fall a-weeping: So I a-wakt as wise this while, As when I fell a sleeping. Hey nonnie, nonnie. &amp;c. XIX. [Mvsick deare sollace, to my thoughts neglected] [1] Mvsick deare sollace, to my thoughts neglected, Musick time sporter, Musick time sporter, to my most respected, Sound on, sound on, thy golden harmony is such, That whilst she doth vouchsafe her ?-??? Lute to tuch. By descant numbers I doe nimbly clime, from Loues secluse, Vnto his Courts, vnto his Courts wher I in fresh attire, attire my Muse. 2 I doe compare her fingers swift resounding. Vnto the heauens SphÃ¦ricall rebounding: Harke, harke, she sings no forst, but breathing sound I heare, And such the concord Diapasons shee doth reare, As when th'immortall god of nature from his seate aboue, First formd words all, &amp; fairely it combind, combind by loue. 3 Diuine Appollo bee not thou offended, That by her better skill thy skils amended, Schollers doe oft more lore, then maisters theirs attaine, Though thine the gro?d, all parts in one though she contain, Yet maist thou triumph that thou hast a Scholler onely one, That can her Lute to thine, and to thy voice, her voice attone. XX. [With fragrant flowers we strew the way] [1] With fragrant flowers we strew the way, And make this our chiefe holy day, For though this Clime were blest of yore, Yet was it neuer proud before: O gracious King, of second Troy, Accept of our vnfained ioy. 2 Now th'Aire is sweeter then sweet Balme, And Satires daunce about the Palme: Now earth with verdure newly dight, Giues perfect signes of her delight. O gracious King of second Troy, Accept of our vnfained ioy. 3 Now Birds record new harmonie, And trees doe whistle melodie: Now euery thing that Nature breeds Doth clad it selfe in pleasant weeds. O gracious King of second Troy, Accept of our vnfained ioy. XXI. An Elegie in remembrance of his Worshipfull friend Thomas Leighton Esquier. Come come all you that draw heauens purest breath, Come Angell brested sonnes of harmonie. Let vs condole in tragicke Eligie, Condole with me our deerest Leightons death, Leighton in whose deere losse death blemisheth Ioues beautie and the soule of true delight, Leighton heauens fauorite and the Muses Iewell, Muses and heauens onely heerein too cruell, Leighton to heauen, hath tane too timely flight. Come then sith Seas of teares, sith sighes and grones, Sith mournefull plaints, lowd cries, and deepe laments, Haue all in vaine deplord these drerements, And fate inexplorable scornes our mones, Let vs in accents graue, and saddest tones, Offer vp Musicks dolefull sacrifice: Let these accords which notes distinguist frame, Serue for memoriall to sweet Leightons name, In whose sad death Musicks delight now dies.
