      <field name="fulltext">TO THE Illustrious Youth OF THE Nobility and Gentry OF GREAT BRITAIN. THE SPEECH of AJAX. Translated by Mr. TATE. The Captains take their Seats, the Soldiers stand, And in a Circle, Crown the Spacious Strand; Respectful Silence, Aws the Murm'ring Field; Up starts the Master of the Seven-fold Shield, Swelling with Choller, the Sigæan Bay He Sternly View'd, and Ships that Mooring lay; Then, with up-lifted Hands, O Jove, He cry'd, Before That Navy, must our Cause be Try'd! Must I Plead Here? And, what Affronts me more, The Vile Ulysses, my Competitor! Ulysses dare with Ajax to Engage? Ulysses! He that Scowr'd from Hector's Rage; Which I sustain'd, and when our Squadrons Burn'd, Upon the Foe, the Conflagration Turn'd: But well He knows this dry Mock-sight of Words, Less Perrillous than That of Clashing Swords. And as in Field of Battle I Excel, The Petty-Fogger in Harranguing Well. But blasted Lawrels must the Combat Yield, In which Ulysses Hopes to win the Field; And has, I grant, already gain'd a Prize Beyond his Merit (pray, let That suffice) For, when o're-come, this will His Tryumph be, He had the Honour to Contend with Me. But, Captains, if my Courage You could doubt, My Noble Blood would make my Title out; The Worthy Heir of Renown'd Telamon, Who, under Hercules, Troy's Bull-wark won, And, with the Brave Adventurers of Greece, Leapt first on Shoar, to sieze the Golden Fleece; And Græcians, who his Father was, ye know, Fam'd Æacus, who Rules the Shades below, Where Sysiphus, amongst the Sentenc'd Souls, (Thief Sysiphus, Ulysses Kinsman) Rowls With Fruitless Labour, a Revolving Stone: Nor does the Thunderer disdain to own This Æacus—Thus I my Lineage prove Deriv'd from Gods; and I the Third from Jove. Nor had I mention'd what before ye knew, Unless Ally'd to Great Achilles too, He was my Brother, Chiefs, I crave a Brother's Due. Why Spawn of Sysiphus (and the Disgrace Of thy own Fraudelent Sysiphian Race) With Rascal Blood, dost Thou attempt to Stain Æacides's yet untainted Strain? Why, Chiefs, am I compell'd to make my Claim, Because I early to your Service came? And to this Loit'rer must the Booty fall, Who, if not Forc'd, had never come at all? Who with fain'd Madness, wou'd have stay'd behind, But Palamede, of more Sagacious Mind, Found out the Cheat (tho' Fatal was the Skill) And Dragg'd him to the Wars against his Will. Shall He possess These Arms, who Arms Declin'd? And not a Kinsmans Legacy Assign'd To Me? Must I Less Qualify'd appear, For having been your foremost Volunteer? Yet, Græcians, Happy had it been for you, That his Pretended Phrensie had been True, Or So Believ'd, then with propitious Pow'rs We had Arriv'd, and Troy long since been Ours: This Mischief-maker, We behind had left, Nor been of Pæan's useful Heir bereft, Who (to our Shame) forlorn in Lemnos dwells, Wasting his Life in Solitary Cells, With Imprecations on Laerte's Heir, (Nor can the Righteous Pow'rs refuse his Pray'r) This Hopeful Youth, your Sworn Allye, possest Of Hercules his Darts, with Want opprest, For Food and Rayment, does on Birds employ Those Arrows destin'd for the Fall of Troy. Yet still (tho' Wretched) Philoctetes Lives, (That Benefit Ulysses's Absence gives) But Palamede, betray'd by this false Guide, Neither Surviv'd, nor without Scandal Dy'd; A Victim to our Politician's Hate, Impeach'd of Treason to the Græcian State, With Trojan Gold Discover'd in his Tent, But Gold by Sly Ulysses Thither sent. By Murder thus, or Banishment, He draws Our Strength away, and Starves the Common Cause; 'Tis Thus He Fights, Ulysses Thus I own The dreadfull'st Man in all our Army grown. Let him as far surpass in Eloquence Our Trusty Nestor, as He's short in Sense, His Sophistry can forge no fair Pretence For leaving his Comrade in Time of Need, With Age Retarded, and a Wounded Steed; Expos'd Tydides knows I do not faign, Who with reproachful Cries— Oft to the Scamp'rer call'd, but call'd in vain. Behold the Justice of the Pow'rs on High, Who keep on Human Deeds, a Watchful Eye; Into the same Distress our Lurcher falls, With Foes Surrounded, and for Succour calls: No Succour came—Till I rusht in, and found The Wretch half Dead, and Grov'ling on the Ground, With real Fright, and a Pretended Wound: Had I not Shielded Him (tho' better Lost) Our Orator, had been a Silent Ghost. But since so Hardy now, his Courage grows, As dares his Life's Preserver to Oppose, Then let us Both to that same Field repair, And He, opprest with the same Foes and Fear, Behind my Buckler Sculk, and Argue There. But by the Way, this Passage bear in Mind, This Wariour, who thro' Loss of Blood could find No Nerves, no Legs to stand upon in Fight, While Ajax Fought, found Legs and Heels for Flight; But these are Trifles. Now prepare to hear Of Action (Chiefs) that will deserve your Ear. Hector comes on, in all his Martial Pride, And brings the God's Embattlled on his Side; Like a Tempestuous Thunder-Bolt He came, Ulysses Trembl'd (and who then could blame His Fright, when Men of Valour did the same) I Ajax only, durst sustain the Shock, I fac'd and fell'd Him, with a lifted Rock. Remember Sirs, how on his Challenge sent, For single Combat, You to Consult went; With Pray'rs and Vows, the Lot might Prosp'rous be: Your Pray'rs were Answer'd; for it fell on Me. We Mett and Fought; d'ye ask who Over-came? I need not Blush to say 'twas a drawn Game Of Glory, and we Shar'd the Stakes of Fame. At last the Trojan Army came Intire, With Sword and Flame, to set our Ships on Fire; Where was your Man of Eloquence, and then (Pardon my Freedom) where your Martial Men? While Both for Flinching had a just Pretence, This Single Breast was your whole Fleet's Defence: Else you had seen, your Thousand Vessels Burn, Your last Reserve, and Hopes of your Return; Then say, Your Ajax Modestly has Crav'd A Sett of Armour, for a Navy Sav'd. But to speak Truth (and who can Truth Condemn?) These Arms want Ajax more than Ajax them. Now let the Florid Ithacus Relate Conquests, that only Laughter will Create, Weak Rhesus, Dolon, Helenus his Fate, A Stol'n Palladium; nothing done by Day, Nothing when Diomedes was away. But if such Petty Champions can be thought Worthy of Armour for Achilles Wrought, Let a Just Dividend be made, and Then Shall Diomedes have Nine Parts in Ten. But what has Ithacus to do with Arms? Who ne're in open Field his Foe Alarms, But Wizard-like works all by Mid-night Charms, The burnish'd Steel would his Dark Plots betray; Shew his Persuers where the Sculker lay; 'Twould crack the fine-spun Projects of his Brain Achille's pond'rous Helmet to sustain; That Nerveless Hand the Pelian Spear to wield! Those Pilf'ring Fingers lift the Wariours Shield! That Massy Shield, and of so vast Extent The Wonders of both Worlds to Represent. Why dost Thou Court a Prize will Ruin Thee? Which, if our Erring Judges shall Decree, These Arms, instead of Frighting Foes away, Will only make Thee to thy Foes a Prey; And when Thou think'st to 'scape, as thou hast done By Running, will not suffer thee to run. Behold thy Target, 'tis as free from Scars And Staunch, as when Thou brought'st it to the Wars, Then look on Mine, with Restless Service Worn, Pierc'd with a Thousand Darts, Huckt, Batter'd, Torn Into a Relict, fit for Sacred Walls, And for as Worthy a Successor calls. But Why should We in Wire-drawn Words Contend; When speedy Action should this Difference end: A Method therefore, Judges, I Propose, Useful to You, and Fatal to Your Foes; Yes, such as all Objections will remove, And Great Achilles Ghost will best Approve; Into the Trojan Camp the Hero's Armour bear, And He that Wins it Back, let him the Trophies Wear. THE SPEECH of Ulysses. Translated by Mr. HILL. Here, to and end, his Speech Great Ajax draws, And rising Murmers spoke the Camp's Applause, Which soon th'Appearance of Ulysses drown'd, Who fix'd his Eyes a while, upon the Ground: Then to the lofty Bench his Aspect rais'd, And, while expecting Crowds in Silence gaz'd, With Words like These, He Acts a subtil Part, And dress'd His Speech in all the Charms of Art. If Heaven, O Greeks! Had heard our Mutual Pray'r, The Prize we seek, had known no doubtful Heir, Thee Great Achilles we had still possest And Thee Alone, thy Valued Arms had blest, But since to Both Stern Fate Unkind appears, (Here stops, and wipes away Dissembled Tears) Who shou'd Succeed to Great Achilles State, But He, by whom Achilles first grew Great? Then let not Ajax Cheat ye with Pretence Of honest Bluntness, when 'tis want of Sense; Nor let the Name of Wit my Cause o'erthrow, That Wit to which you Greeks your Blessings owe, Since it has serv'd You, never take Offence That I am Grac'd with moving Eloquence, No Man shou'd lose an Honour Justly His, And none pretend to Borrow'd Dignities. Yet, since bold Ajax boasts himself to be Grandson to Jupiter, I'll let you see I bear the Blood of Jove as well as he: Laertes was my Father; one Step high'r Arcesius stands, to him Great Jove was Sire; Nor is it known, that one of this Descent, Justly condemn'd, to sentenc'd Exile went. Great Hermes does my Mother's Lineage Grace; Thus double Glories crown our Heav'nly Race. What, tho' I'm Nobler by the Mothers Side! Or tho' my Father's Hands were never dy'd In Brother's Blood! Shall that the Claim decide? No, no, be just, and both our Merits weigh, And he who has most Worth shall win the Day. Tho' Telamon and Peleus Brothers were, Yet what gains Ajax from so Great a Pair? 'Tis not the Great in Birth must win these Arms, But he whose Breast the purest Honour warms; Or say the First in Blood deserves this Grace, Yet, how can Ajax justly, claim that Place? Peleus was Father, Pyrrhus is the Son To Great Achilles, not young Telamon. These Arms to Pthia, or to Scyron bear, For Teucer is as near as Ajax there; Yet hopes, not he, his Cozen's Arms to gain; Or if he did, would he not hope in vain? Since then 'tis Merit that most justly pleads, I'll speak, tho' I can ne'er express my Deeds. Thetis, who knew Achilles must be Great, And in his swelling Honours find his Fate, Her Warlike Son in Virgins Habit drest; Whom all mistook, and Ajax with the rest: Then I, who guess'd the Cheat, with Female Toys Mix'd Martial Weapons, Baits for sturdy Boys; The Maid-like Hero strait began to weild The pointed Spear, and poise the weighty Shield: Oh Goddess born, cry'd I, we know thee now, To thee the mighty Fate of Troy must bow: Why dost thou doubt their Tow'rs to overthrow? With that I forc'd him from the Maids to go. I made the Strong in mighty Actions shine, And all the Deeds he did are therefore mine. My Spear o'erthrew contentending Telephon, And cur'd the Suppliant Prostrate when I'd done: By my Contrivance mighty Thebes was won; Lesbos and Tenedos, and Chrysa too, And Cylla, Towns which Great Apollo knew; With Cyros, as you all remember well, And raz'd Lernessa's wondrous Ruins fell. In short, From me Great Priam's Mis'ry's flow; By me the Famous Hector's Head lies low: I gave those Arms, by which Achilles came, And in return for those, to these lay Claim; Achilles dead, with Justice I may crave What to Achilles, living, once I gave. When one Man's Grief had all the Greeks betray'd, A Thousand Ships in Aulis Port were stay'd; The long-wish'd Winds an envious Silence keep, Or with opposing Fury toss the Deep; Griev'd Agamemnon, whom his harden'd Fate, To free the Navy from Diana's Hate, Commands his Daughters Blood to Sacrifice, The hard Injunction sullenly denies, Reviles the Gods, who urge so hard a thing, And moves Paternal Passions in a King. Yet I o'ercame the Pangs which shook his Blood, And drew him to prefer the Publick Good: Pardon Atrides, for I now must own Before a partial Judge, my Wit was shown In a most hateful Cause; The Common Good His Scepter, Brother, All, conjointly woed, To make him purchase Fame with Filial Blood. Then to the mournful Mother was I sent, To win, by Wit, her long-denied Consent; Oh then, had Ajax gone, our flagging Sails Had still, in vain, expected ling'ring Gales. Next, To the Trojan Court Alone I went With a rough Message, which by me was sent; The crowded Streets with pressing Numbers shine, Yet I, undaunted, urg'd my bold Design, And, as commanded, Paris I accuse, Who durst the Bounty of his Host abuse; I re-demand the ravish'd Helena, And all the Goods they basely stole away; I mov'd Great Priam and Antenor too, But Paris and his Brothers angry grew, Till, with th'Abettors of his Rape, he rose, And, blind with Passion, scarce refrain'd from Blows. This You, O Menalaus, may remind, 'Twas the first Time we in one Danger join'd; The tedious Tale I fear wou'd ne'er be done, Shou'd I name all my Hand and Head have won To serve the State, since this long War begun. One Battel fought, their Walls enclose the Foe, Nor would they bravely stand a second Blow, Till Bloody Wars to ten long Winters grow. Mean Time, what Service did'st Thou to the State? Fam'd but for Force, and but in Fighting Great. How wer't Thou useful? What has Ajax won? But if you ask What has Ulysses done? My Artful Stratagems the Foes ensnar'd, By me defensive Trenches were prepar'd; I made the Soldiers gladly bear their Scars, And calmly wait an End to tedious Wars; I found the Army Meat, kept them from Harms, And taught 'em how to use their untried Arms. You may remember there were Orders giv'n To leave the Town, to its last Efforts driv'n, And this the King believ'd the Will of Heav'n; Then was the Time, Ajax should then have spoke, And urg'd the Fate of Ilium at one Stroak: Why did not He the Nobler Siege implore? He might have Fought, if he cou'd do no more: Why did not He in Glorious Arms appear, And check, by some fine Speech, the common Fear? It had been easy, sure, for Him to try, Who looks so lofty, and can speak so high, No Matter, though the Champion strove to fly. Coward, I saw Thee turn thy Back to Fame, And hoise ignoble Sails to swell thy Shame; Then I advanc'd, What Madness, Fools, said I, Perswades you to abandon yielding Troy? Tell me, O Greeks, what will you bear away, But a base Infamy, from Ten Years stay? With Words like these I alter'd their Intent, For Sorrow made my Language Eloquent. Full of Distrusts, the King a Council calls, But not one Word from Silent Ajax falls; Yet when in bitter Terms Thersitis spoke, And durst with Insolence the King provoke, My daring Scepter struck a dreadful Stroak. My Words the doubting Host with Hopes inspire, And Artfully recall extinguish'd Fire: If then the King, since that, has Glory won, Mine was the Worth of what by my Advice was done. Besides, What Greek, or seeks, or praises Thee? Tydides always asks Advice from Me; In Me he's Happy still, in Me confides, I'm his free Choice of all the Host besides. When Night and Neighb'ring Foes I once despis'd, A Scout of Their's, call'd Dolon, I surpriz'd, Nor kill'd him, till I in his Bosom find The Stratagems that Faithless Troy design'd: All now discover'd, What shou'd I enquire? Or might I not with Praise enough retire? Yet, not contented so, I onward bent, Kill'd Rhesus and his Servants in their Tent; Then, Victor-like, my Honour to maintain, Mounted his Chariot, and return'd again. Can You deny Achille's Arms to one, Who, by a Night's Desert, his Horses won? A Deed like this Ajax wou'd ne'er have done. Why should I now repeat what all must know! To me Sarpedon's baffled Forces owe, As do's Cærano's too, their Overthrow: Iphitides, Alastor, Chromius, Alcander, Prytanis, and Halius, Pheridamas, Charopes, Thoon too, Eunomus, and Noemenus, I slew, With more of Meaner Rank in Trojans View. I boast, Dear Countrymen, some Honour'd Wounds, Fair in this Place; nor Credit empty Sounds, Behold, said he, (with that Uncloaths his Breast) In your Defence these Scars Ulysses blest. In this long War what Blood has Ajax lost? Let him produce the Wounds his Service cast. What! if according to his Brags, he strove, And fought for Græcia's Fleet with Troy and Jove; I own he did so, nor wou'd I detract With Envious Malice from so Great an Act. Yet why shou'd he pretend all Worth his Own? And make our common Glories his Alone? Actorides, in Great Achille's Form From Græcian Ships repell'd the Trojan fiery storm, Vainly he boasts that only He could stand, And Combat Warlike Hector Hand to Hand: Nay tho' of Nine the last, preferr'd by Lot, The King, the Chiefs, and Me withal, forgot. But say, brave Man, what End your Combat found; Cou'd all your fruitless Force the Valiant Hector wound? Oh Heav'ns! with Grief, I can remember well, When the Great Græcian Wall Achilles fell; Nor Tears, nor Greifs, nor Fears, my Zeal withheld, I rais'd his Corps, and bore him from the Field: These Shoulders, These, I say, his Weight did bear, With all those Arms which now I strive to wear; With Ease my Strength can such a Weight sustain, My Learning can your valued Gift explain. Ambitious Thetis ne'er design'd such Charms Shou'd Grace her Valiant Offsprings shining Arms, That such a Senseless Soldier shou'd be seen In so Divine a Gift, and He so Mean. His painted Shield his Ignorance wou'd prove, On which the rowling Ocean seems to move; The Earth with Towns, the Skies with Stars we see Arctos undrown'd, from Waters ever free; The Pleiades and Heiades there are, And Arm'd Orion too is painted there: Thus Ajax seeks these Noble Arms to gain, Which, if he wins, he knows not to explain. Do's he upbraid me that I wandred far, And sought, by Artful Wiles, to shun the War? In this he Wounds Achille's Honour too, I did but what that Hero strove to do. Nay He's most guilty too, if That's a Crime, For I was entred, long before his Time, His Mother Him, Me my kind Wife Detain'd, They had Our Youth, but You Our Manhood gain'd, I fear not, did I fail my Cause to Plead, But that my Silent Merit wou'd Succeed, For Ajax never did Discover Me, Yet I Discover'd One more Great than He. But He; least You shou'd think his Words Untrue, If I am blam'd alone, Reproaches You; You who the Blood of Palamede have Spilt, If Wrongfully Accus'd, bear double Guilt. But Oh! Too plain his Crime, nor did he try, A Fact so fully prov'd, to Justify, Nor Heard You only how He did Conspire, Your Eyes, O Græcians! Saw the Traitors Hire, 'Twas not My Fault, but by Your own Consent, Pæantius has his Time in Lemnos spent, Defend your Crimes your Selves; I own thus far, I did Advise Him to Avoid the War, By Absence from the Field His Wound to Cure, And Mitigate the Pains He did endure; He did as I Advis'd—you see He Lives, I've prov'd the Council Good, by the Success it Gives. But since on Him depends the Fate of Troy, Send Me not for Him, nor my Wiles employ, Send Ajax thither, He may better go, His Moving Eloquence will Conquer Woe, Tho' Mad with Anger, Grief and raging Pain, His Tempting Tongue will win Him back again. Ah No!—Simois shall sooner backward flow And Shady Woods on Ida cease to grow, Nay Greece shall sooner Aid the Trojan Foe; Than I forbear to Serve You ev'ry way, And Stupid Ajax's Council gain the Day. And Philoctetes tho' thy Aim I see, Incens'd against the King, My Friends and Me, Tho' still You Curse, and Wish Ulysses Dead, And hope an Interview to take My Head, Yet I'll Attempt Thee, and Thy Arrows gain, If Heav'n forbears to make Me strive in vain; I'll do't as I the Dardan Prophet won, As I Unravel'd all that Fate, for Troy, had spun; As I the doubtful Oracle explain'd, And from her Fane, the Phrygian Pallas gain'd The Fane whose Gates unnumber'd Foes maintain'd; Had This been wanting, Troy had never fell, Pray when did Ajax's Arts Succeed so well? Where was the boasted Strength of Ajax Then? Why did that Champion doubt like common Men? Why was not I afraid of gloomy Night? How durst I pass the Watch, and Threatning Weapons slight? Scale the high Walls of Ilium's loftiest Tow'r, And, from Her Temple, Steal Their Tut'lar Pow'r: Then, loaded with the Prize, return again, And all the Dangers of the Road Disdain? Had not I done all this, the Sev'n-fold Shield Had still Arm'd Ajax in a Praiseless Field. That Night o'er Troy the Victory I won, Because I made it Easy to be done. Why on Tydydes dost thou vainly fleer? He had his Part in this, nor minds thy Leer, Nor did Thy-self Defend the Fleet Alone, Thou hadst an Army's Help, I had but One He knew that Conduct Courage shou'd command, Nor look'd for Wisdom from a Strenuous Hand, He might himself have stood a Candidate, Or t'other Ajax far more moderate. Fierce T'hoas or Euryphylus, with these, Idomeneus, and Meriones, Crete bred the last; or Menelaus who Are Strong, and skill'd in War, as well as You; Yet stoop to my Advice. War is thy Pride, Thou want'st my Conduct for thy Valour's Guide. Thy Courage has no Thought, I look before, Thou can'st Fight well, but thou can'st do no more. Both Time and Place must be by Me assign'd, Thou art in Body strong, I strong in Mind. If Pilots, skilful in their Art, excell The Brawny Slaves who row their Vessels well; If Captains Common Soldiers do exceed, My Worth surpasses Thine in ev'ry Deed. 'Tis true my Bones and Sinews want thy Strength, But my bright Soul extends to double Length. Now, O ye Princes, think on all my Care, And let my Merits recommend my Pray'r; I mov'd opposing Fate, and therefore I, In pointing out the Way, have taken Troy. Then by our mutual Hopes, Troy's Overthrow, And all those Gods which lately blest the Foe. If something yet remains, that must be done By Wisdom's Guide, and midst of Danger won; If in the Trojan Fate there yet may be A Knot unloos'd, then Princes think on Me; But if there's none, to Him the Arms resign, Here stops, and shows Minerva's Fatal Sign. The Chiefs were mov'd, here Words approv'd their Charms, And matchless Valour yields to Rhet'rick's Charms; He who alone so often had withstood Sword, Fire, and Hector, and the Thund'ring God, Till now unconquer'd, yeilds to Sorrow's Weight, Nor can support this one last Turn of Fate. Then from his Side his shining Sword he drew, Thou'rt mine, he cry'd, or will he claim Thee too, Thou shal't efface the Wrongs thy Master knew. Thou who so oft wer't stain'd with Trojan Blood, Shal't bathe thy Edge in a more Noble Flood. Fame with this News o'er the whole World shall fly, That Ajax cou'd by none but Ajax die. This said, the Sword a dreadful Entrance found, Pierc'd deep a Breast till then secure from Wound, And Streams of Blood gush'd fiercely on the Ground. To draw the Weapon back he wanted Strength, When from the reaking Earth they saw at length, A Purple Flow'r spread wide in painted State, Which Hyacinthus Wound did first create, Whose inmost Leaves in sev'ral Letters Paint The Name of Ajax, and the Boy's Complaint.
