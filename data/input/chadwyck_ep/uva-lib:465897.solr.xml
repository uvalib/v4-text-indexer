      <field name="fulltext">THE LETTERS AND WORKS OF LADY MARY WORTLEY MONTAGU. VOL. II. JULIA TO OVID. Written at Twelve Years of Age, in imitation of Ovid's Epistles. Are love and power incapable to meet? And must they all be wretched who are great? Enslav'd by titles, and by forms confin'd, For wretched victims to the state design'd. What rural maid, that my sad fortune knows, Would quit her cottage to embrace my woes? Would be this cursed sacrifice to power, This wretched daughter of Rome's emperour? When sick with sighs to absent Ovid given, I tire with vows the unrelenting Heaven, Drown'd in my tears, and with my sorrows pale, What then do all my kindred gods avail? Let proud Augustus the whole world subdue, Be mine to place all happiness in you; With nobler pride I can on thrones look down, Can court your love and can despise a crown,â O Love! thou pleasure never dearly bought! Whose joys exceed the very lover's thought; Of that soft passion, when you teach the art, In gentle sounds it steals into the heart; With such sweet magic does the soul surprise, 'Tis only taught us better by your eyes. O Ovid! first of the inspired train, To Heaven I speak in that enchanting strain, So sweet a voice can never plead in vain. Apollo will protect his favourite son, And all the little Loves unto thy succour run. The Loves and Muses in thy prayer shall join, And all their wishes and their vows be thine; Some god will soften my hard Father's breast, And work a miracle to make thee blest. Hard as this is, I even this could bear, But greater ills than what I feel, I fear. My fameâmy Ovidâboth for ever fled, What greater evil is there left to dread! Yes, there is one . . . . . . Avert it, Gods, who do my sorrows see! Avert it, thou, who art a god to me! When back to Rome your wishing eyes are cast, And on the lessening towers you gaze your lastâ When fancy shall recal unto your view The pleasures now for ever lost to you, The shining court, and all the thousand ways To melt the nights and pass the happy daysâ Will you not sigh, and hate the wretched maid, Whose fatal love your safety has betray'd? Say that from me your banishment does come, And curse the eyes that have expell'd you Rome? Those eyes, which now are weeping for your woes, The sleep of death shall then for ever close. IRREGULAR VERSES TO TRUTH. Written at Fourteen Years of Age. Where, lovely Goddess, dost thou dwell? In what remote and silent shade? Within what cave or lonely cell? With what old hermit, or unpractis'd maid? In vain I've sought thee all around, But thy unfashionable sound In crowds was never heard, Nor ever has thy form in town or court appear'd. The sanctuary is not safe to thee, Chas'd thence by endless mystery; Thy own professors chase thee thence, And wage eternal war with thee and sense; Then in perplexing comments lost, E'en when they would be thought to show the most. Most beautiful when most distress'd, Descend, O Goddess, to my breast; There thou may'st reign, unrivall'd and alone, My thoughts thy subjects, and my heart thy throne. SONG. [How happy is the harden'd heart] How happy is the harden'd heart, Where interest is the only view! Can sigh and meet, or smile and part, Nor pleas'd, nor griev'd, nor false, nor trueâ Yet, have they truly peace of mind? Or do they ever truly know The bliss sincerer tempers find, Which truth and virtue can bestow? EPILOGUE TO THE TRAGEDY OF CATO. You see in ancient Rome what folly reign'd; A folly British men would have disdain'd. Here's none so weak to pity Cato's case, Who might have liv'd, and had a handsome place; But rashly vain, and insolently great, He perish'd by his faultâand not his fate. Thank Heav'n! our patriots better ends pursue, With something more than glory in their view. Poets write moralsâpriests for martyrs preachâ Neither such fools to practise what they teach. Though your dear country much you wish to serve, For bonny Britons 'tis too hard to starve; Or what's all one, to any generous mind, From girls, champagne, and gaming, be confin'd; Portius might well obey his sire's command, Returning to his small paternal land; A low estate was ample to support His private life, far distant from the court! Far from the crowd of emulating beaux, Where Martia never wanted birthday clothes. For you, who live in these more polish'd days, To spend your money, lo! ten thousand ways; Dice may run ill, or duns demand their due, And ways to get (God knows) are very few; In times so differing, who shall harshly blame Our modern heroes, not to act the same? TO A FRIEND ON HIS TRAVELS. From this vile town, immers'd in smoke and care, To you who brighten in a purer air, Your faithful friend conveys her tenderest thought (Though now perhaps neglected and forgot). May blooming health your wonted mirth restore, And every pleasure crown your every hour; Caress'd, esteem'd, and lov'd, your merit known, And foreign lands admire you, like your own: Whilst I in silence various fortunes bear, Distracted with the rage of bosom-war: My restless fever tears my changeful brain, With mix'd ideas of delight and pain; Sometimes soft views my morning dreams employ In the faint dawn of visionary joy; Which rigid reason quickly drives awayâ I seek the shade and fly from rising day: In pleasing madness meet some moment's ease, And fondly cherish my belov'd disease. If female weakness melt my woman's mind, At least no weakness in the choice I find, Not sooth'd to softness by a warbling flute, Nor the bought merit of a birthday suit; Not lost my heart by the surprising skill In opera tunes, in dancing, or quadrille. The only charm my inclination moves Is such a virtue, Heaven itself approves! A soul superior to each vulgar view, Great, steady, gentle, generous, and true. How I regret my trifling hours past, And look with sorrow o'er the dreary waste! In false pursuits and vanity bestow'd, The perfect image of a dirty road; Through puddles oft, o'er craggy rocks I stray, A tiresome dull uncomfortable way: And after toiling long through thick and thin To reach some meanly mercenary inn, The bills are high, and very bad the fare, I curse the wretched entertainment there: And, jogging on, resolve to stop no more Where gaudy signs invite me to the door. TO THE SAME. Though old in ill, the traitor sure should find Some secret sting transfix his guilty mind. Though bribes or favour may protect his fame, Or fear restrain invectives on his name; None 'quits himselfâhis own impartial thought Condemnsâand conscience shall record the fault. Yet more, my friend! your happy state may bear This disappointment, as below your care. For what you have, return to Heav'n your thanks; Few share the prizes, many draw the blanks. Of breach of promise loudly you complain, Have you then known the world so long in vain? Worse than the iron age, our impious times Have learn'd to laugh at most flagitious crimes. Are you to know that 'tis a jest to find Unthinking honesty pervade the mind? At best, they say, the man is strangely odd Who keeps his oath, and can believe a God. This was the cant when Edward held the throne, Before Spinosa wrote, or Hobbes was known; When the gilt Bible was the king's delight, When prayer preceded day, and hymns the night. Now softening eunuchs sing Italian airs, The dancing dame to midnight ball repairs. Now, if an honest man (like you) I view, Contemning interest, and to virtue true, I deem, he deviates from Nature's rules, Like burning hills, or petrifying pools. I stand astonish'd at the strange portent, And think some revolution the event; As all grave heads were startled, as they heard That a new comet in the west appear'd; When from a human mother rabbits sprung, And Ward his pills like hand-granadoes flung; When gratis scattering cures amidst the crowdâ A miracle! as Charteris swears aloudâ A greater miracle I daily see, The ancient faith of Pius reign in thee. Observe the wretch, who has that faith forsook, How clear his voice, and how assur'd his look! Like innocence, and as serenely bold, Conscious protection of almighty gold! While thus he reasons to relieve his fears: âOft I've deceiv'd, yet still have kept my ears. I have been threat'ned for a broken vow, And yet successively have laugh'd till now, And will laugh on, my fortune's not the worse, When starving cullies rail, or vainly curse.â Shall then the villain 'scape? such knaves as he Be rich and safe, and from all vengeance free? Consider, friend, but coolly, and you'll find Revenge the frailty of a feeble mind; Nor think he 'scapes though he should never feel The pangs of poison, or the force of steel. There is a time when conscience shakes the soul, When Toland's tenets cannot fear control, When secret anguish fills the anxious breast, Vacant from business, nor compos'd by rest; Then dreams invade, the injured gods appear All arm'd with thunder, and awake his fear; The wretch will start at every flash that flies, Grow pale at the first murmur of the skies; Then, if a fever fires corrupted blood, In every fit he feels the hand of God. Trembling, and sunk into the last despair, He dares not offer one repenting prayer; For how can hope with desperate guilt agree? And the worst beast is worthier life than he; This, at the best, will be his certain fate, Or Heav'n may sooner think his crimes complete. FRAGMENT TO ? Let mules and asses in that circle tread, And proud of trappings toss a feather'd head; Leave you the stupid business of the state, Strive to be happy, and despise the great: Come where the Graces guide the gentle day, Where Venus rules amidst her native sea, Where at her altar gallantries appear, And even Wisdom dares not show severe. TO MR. ? For ever blest be that prolific brain Which can such store of images contain! Thus the charg'd trees, with blooming odours crown'd, Shed their fair blossoms with profusion round; So swells the brook with heav'n-descended rain, And flows meand'ring on thirsty plain; Such various talents were by Heav'n design'd (Too vast a treasure for a single mind), To please, astonish, and instruct mankind. With a delight not to be told, I view Themes long exhausted in your hands grow new; Past all describing your descriptions are, So full, so just, so bold, yet regular; The style so varied that it wants a name, Which, ever differing, ever is the same; You raise or calm our passions as you please, The human heart your powerful pen obeys. When eager Trasimond pursues the course, We hear the whip, and see the foaming horse; With Sophronia we have wept and smil'd, So soon offendedâsooner reconcil'd. Go on, great author! that the world may see How bright, when from pedantic fetters free, True genius shines, and shines alone in thee. Give new editions, with a noble scorn Of insect critics, who'd obscure thy morn; Neglect their censures, nor thy work delay, The owls still sicken at the sight of day. JOHN DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH. When the proud Frenchman's strong rapacious hand Spread over Europe ruin and command, Our sinking temples and expiring law With trembling dread the rolling tempest saw; Destin'd a province to insulting Gaul, This genius rose, and stopp'd the ponderous fall. His temperate valour form'd no giddy scheme, No victory rais'd him to a rage of fame; The happy temper of his even mind No danger e'er could shock, or conquest blind. Fashion'd alike by Nature and by Art, To please, engage, and int'rest ev'ry heart. In public life by all who saw approv'd, In private hours by all who knew him lov'd. A CHARACTER. Though a strong vanity may you persuadeâ You are not for a politician made; Your tropes are drawn from Robin Walpole's head, Your sense is but repeating what he said; A useful puppy, eminently known, As proud to father what he will not own, Some arguments he leaves you to expose, Some valets flutter in my lord's old clothes. But should he strip you of his borrow'd sense, How poorly thin your boasted eloquence! Know your own talents better, I advise; Be brisk, yet dull, but aim not to look wise; In low insipid rhymes place your delight; Laugh without jests, and without reading write. Despis'd by men, in ladies' ruelles sit, Where country coquettes bolster up your wit. May all your minuets applauses meet! An able coxcomb only in your feet. By fawning lies, in leagues with court-knaves grow, And smile on beauties whom you do not know. Then, acting, all the coyness of a lover, Your no-intrigue endeavour to discover. Aiming at wit, in many an evil hour, Have the perpetual will without the power. Conceit for breeding, rude for easy take, Horseplay for wit, and noise for mirth mistake. Love's perfect joys to perfect men belong; Seek you but the occasion for a song. Thus to the end of life may you remain A merry blockhead, treacherous and vain. LORD HERVEY TO MR. FOX. Written at Florence, 1729, in imitation of the Sixth Ode of the Second Book of Horace. âSeptimi Gades aditure mecum.â Thou dearest youth, who taught me first to know What pleasures from a real friendship flow; Where neither int'rest nor deceit have part, But all the warmth is native of the heart; Thou know'st to comfort, soothe, or entertain, Joy of my health, and cordial to my pain. When life seem'd failing in her latest stage, And fell disease anticipated age; When wasting sickness, and afflictive pain, By Ãsculapius' sons oppos'd in vain, Forc'd me reluctant, desperate to explore A warmer sun, and seek a milder shore, Thy steady love, with unexampled truth, Forsook each gay companion of thy youth, Whate'er the prosperous or the great employs, Business and interest, and love's softer joys, The weary steps of misery to attend, To share distress, and make a wretch thy friend. If o'er the mountain's snowy top we stray, Where Carthage first explor'd the vent'rous way; Or through the tainted air of Rome's parched plains, Where want resides and superstition reigns; Cheerful and unrepining still you bear Each dangerous rigour of the varying year; And kindly anxious for thy friend alone, Lament his sufferings, and forget thy own. Oh! would kind Heaven, those tedious sufferings past, Permit me, Ickworth, rest and health at last! In that lov'd shade, my youth's delightful seat, My early pleasure, and my late retreat, Where lavish Nature's favourite blessings flow, And all the seasons all their sweets bestow; There might I trifle carelessly away The milder ev'ning of life's clouded day; From business and the world's intrusion free, With books, with love, with beauty, and with thee; No further want, no wish, yet unpossess'd, Could e'er disturb this unambitious breast. Let those who Fortune's shining gifts implore, Who sue for glory, splendour, wealth, or power, View this inactive state with feverish eyes, And pleasure they can never taste, despise; Let them still court that goddess' falser joys, Who, while she grants their pray'r, their peace destroys. I envy not the foremost of the great, Not Walpole's self, directing Europe's fate; Still let him load ambition's thorny shrine, Fame be his portion, and contentment mine. But if the gods, sinister still, deny To live in Ickworth, let me there but die; Thy hands to close my eyes in Death's long night, Thy image to attract their latest sight: Then to the grave attend thy Poet's hearse, And love his memory as you lov'd his verse. CONTINUATION BY LADY M. W. MONTAGU. So sung the poet in a humble strain, With empty pockets, and a head in pain, Where the soft clime inclin'd the soul to rest, And past'ral images inspir'd the breast. Apollo listen'd from his heavenly bower, And, in his health restor'd, express'd his power. Pygmalion thus before the Paphian shrine, With trembling vows address'd the power divine; Durst hardly make his hopeless wishes known, And scarce a greater miracle was shownâ Returning vigour glow'd in every vein, And gay ideas flutter'd in the brain; Back he returns to breathe his native air, And all his first resolves are melted there! UNFINISHED SKETCHES OF A LARGER POEM. Now, with fresh vigour, morn her light displays, And the glad birds salute her kindling rays; The opening buds confess the sun's return, And rous'd from night all nature seems new-born; When ponderous Dulness slowly wing'd her way, And with thick fogs oppos'd the rising day. PhÅbus retir'd as from Thyestes' feast, Droop'd all the flow'rs, th'aerial music ceas'd. Pleas'd with her influence, she exults with pride, âShall mortals then escape my power?â she cried: âNay, in this town where smoke and mists conspire To cloud the head, and damp the poet's fire, Shall Addison my empire here dispute, So justly founded, lov'd, and absolute? Explode my children, ribaldry and rhyme, Rever'd from Chaucer's down to Dryden's time? Distinguish 'twixt false humour and the true, And wit make lovely to the vulgar view? Noâbetter things my destiny ordains, For Oxford has the wand, and Anna reigns.â She ended, and assum'd Duke Disney's grin, With broad plump face, pert eyes, and ruddy skin, Which show'd the stupid joke which lurk'd within. In this lov'd form she knock'd at St. John's gate, Where crowds already for his levee wait; And wait they may, those wretches that appear To talk of service past and long arrear: But the proud partner of his pleasure goes Through crowds of envious eyes and servile bows. And now approaching where the statesman lay, To his unwilling eyes reveal'd the day. Starting, he wak'd, and, waking swore by God, âThis early visit, friend, is wondrous odd! Scarce have I rested two small hours in bed, And fumes of wine oppress my aching head. By thee I'm sure my soul is understood Too well to plague me for the public good. Let stupid patriots toil to serve the brutes, And waste the fleeting hours in vain disputes; The use of power supreme I better know, Nor will I lose the joys the gods bestow; The sparkling glass, soft flute, and willing fair Alternate guard me from the shocks of care. 'Tis the prerogative of wit like mine To emulate in ease the pow'rs divine; And while I revel, leave the busy fools To plot like chemists, or to trudge like tools.â âBelieve me, lord! (replies his seeming friend) Some difficulties every state attend. Cares must surround the men that wealth possess, And sorrow mingles ev'n with love's success. Great as you are, no greatness long is sure, Advancement is but pain if not secure. All your long schemes may vanish in an hour, Oh tremble at the sad reverse of pow'r! How will these slaves that waiting watch your eye Insulting smile or pass regardless by! Nor is this thought the creature of my fears, Approaching ruin now most strong appears. Men must be dull who passively obey, And ignorance fixes arbitrary sway; Think of this maxim, and no more permit A dangerous writer to retail his wit. The consequence of sense is liberty, And if men think aright, they will be free; Encourage you the poet I shall bring, Your Granville, he already tries to sing; Nor think, my lord, I only recommend An able author, but a useful friend; In verse his phlegm, in puns he shows his fire, And skill'd in pimping to your heart's desire.â âI thank thee, duke (replies the drowsy peer), But cannot listen to thy childish fear. This Addison, 'tis true, debauch'd in schools, Will sometimes oddly talk of musty rules. Yet here and there I see a master line, I feel and I confess the power divine. In spite of interest charm'd into applause, I wish for such a champion in our cause: Nor shall your reasons force me to submit To patronise a bard of meaner wit; Men can but say wit did my judgment blind, And wit's the noblest frailty of the mind.â The disappointed goddess, swell'd with spite, Dropping her borrow'd form, appears in open light. So the sly nymph in masquerade disguise, The faith of her suspected lover tries; But when the perjury too plain appears, Her eyes are fill'd with mingled rage and tears; No more remembers the affected tone, Sinks the feign'd voice, and thunders in her own. âHow hast thou dar'd my party then to quit, Or dost thou, wretch, presume thou art a wit? Read thy own works, consider well each line, In each dull page, how palpably. I shine! 'Tis I that to thy eloquence affords Such empty thoughts wrapt in superfluous words; To me alone your pamphlet-praise you owe, 'Tis I your tropes and florid sense bestow; After such wreaths bestow'd, such service done, Dare you refuse protection to my son? The time shall come, though now at court ador'd, When still a writer, though no more a lord, On common stalls thy darling works be spread, And thou shalt answer them to make them read.â She said, and turning show'd her wrinkled neck, In scales and colour like a roach's back. THE COURT OF DULNESS. A FRAGMENT. Her palace plac'd beneath a muddy road, And such the influence of the dull abode, The carrier's horse above can scarcely drag his load. Here chose the goddess her belov'd retreat, Which PhÅbus tries in vain to penetrate; Adorn'd within with shells of small expense, (Emblems of tinsel rhyme and trifling sense), Perpetual fogs enclose the sacred cave, The neighbouring sinks their fragrant odours gave; In contemplation here she pass'd her hours, Closely attended by subservient powers: Bold Profanation with a brazen brow,â Much to this great ally does Dulness owe: But still more near the goddess you attend, Naked Obscenity! her darling friend. To thee for shelter all the dull still fly, Pert double meanings e'en at school we try. What numerous writers owe their praise to thee, No sexâno ageâis from thy influence free; By thee how bright appears the senseless song, By thee the book is sold, the lines are strong. The heaviest poet, by thy powerful aid, Warms the brisk youth and charms the sprightly maid; Where breathes the mortal who's not prov'd thy force In well-bred pun, or waiting-room discourse? Such were the chiefs who form'd her gloomy court, Her pride, her ornament, and her support: Behind attended such a numerous crowd Of quibbles strain'd, old rhymes, and laughter loud, Throngs that might even make a goddess proud. Yet pensive thoughts lay brooding in her breast, And fear, the mate of power, her mind oppress'd. Oft she revolv'dâfor oh, too well she knew What Merlin sung, and part long since prov'd true, âWhen Harry's brows the diadem adorn, From Reformation Learning shall be born; Slowly in strength the infant shall improve, The parent's glory and it's country's love: Free from the thraldom of monastic rhymes, In bright progression bless succeeding times; Milton free poesy from the monkish chain, And Addison that Milton shall explain; Point out the beauties of each living page; Reform the taste of a degen'rate age; Show that true wit disdains all little art, And can at once engage and mend the heart; Knows even popular applause to gain, Yet not malicious, wanton, or profane.â This prophecy perplex'd her anxious head; And, yawning thrice, thus to her sons she said: âWhen such an author honour'd shall appear, 'Tis plain, the hour of our destruction's near! And public rumour now aloud proclaims At universal monarchy he aims. What to this hero, whom shall we oppose? A strong confederacy of stupid foesâ Such brave allies as are by nature fit To check the progress of o'erflowing wit; Where envy and where impudence are join'd To contradict the voice of humankind, At Dacier's ignorance shall gravely smile, And blame the coarseness of Spectator's style; Shall swear that Tickell understands not Greek, That Addison can't write, nor Walpole speak.â Fir'd by this project Profanation roseâ âOne leader, Goddess, let me here propose; In a near realm, which owns thy gentle sway, My darling son now chants his pleasing lay, Trampling on order, decency, and laws, And vaunts himself the champion of my cause. Him will I bring to teach the callow youth To scorn dry moralsâlaugh at sacred truth. All fears of future reckonings he shall quench, And bid them bravely drink and freely wench. By his example much, by precept more, There learn 'tis wit to swear, and safe to wh?re. Mocks Newton's schemes, and Tillotson's discourse, And imitates the virtues of a horse. With this design to add to his renown, He wears the rev'rend dress of band and gown.â The Goddess, pleas'd, bestow'd a gracious grin, When thus does fair Obscenity begin: âMy humbler subjects are not plac'd so high, They joke in kitchens, and in cellars ply; Yet one I have, bred in those worthy schools, Admir'd by shoals of male and female fools; In ballads what I dictate he shall sing, And troops of converts to my banners bring. Bold in my cause, and most profanely dull, With smooth unmeaning rhymes the town shall lull; Shall sing of worms in great Arbuthnot's strain, In lewd burlesque the sacred Psalms profane; To maids of honour songs obscene address, Nor need we doubt his wonderful success. Long have I watch'd this genius yet unknown, Inspir'd his rhyme, and mark'd him for my own; His early youth in superstition bred, And monkish legends all the books he read. Tinctur'd by these, proceeds his love of rhyme, Milton he scorns, but Crambo thinks divine. And oh! 'tis sure (our foes confess this truth) The old Cambronians yield to this stupendous youth. But present want obscures the poet's name, Be it my charge to talk him into fame. My Lansdowne (whose love-songs so smoothly run, My darling author, and my fav'rite son) He shall protect the man whom I inspire, And Windsor Forest openly admire; And Bolingbroke with flattery shall bribe, 'Till the charm'd lord most nobly shall subscribe; And hostile Addison too late shall find, 'Tis easier to corrupt than mend mankind. The town, which now revolts, once more obey, And the whole island own my pristine sway!â She said, and slowly leaves the realm of night, While the curs'd phantoms praise her droning flight. AN EPISTLE FROM POPE TO LORD BOLINGBROKE. Confess, dear LÃ¦lius! pious, just, and wise, Some self-content does in that bosom rise, When you reflect, as sure you sometimes must, What talents Heaven does to thy virtue trust, While with contempt you view poor humankind, Weak, wilful, sensual, passionate, and blind. Amid these errors thou art faultless found, (The moon takes lustre from the darkness round) Permit me too, a small attendant star, To twinkle, though in a more distant sphere; Small things with great, we poets oft compare. With admiration all your steps I view, And almost envy what I can't pursue. The world must grant (and 'tis no common fame) My courage and my probity the same. But you, great Lord, to nobler scenes were born; Your early youth did Anna's court adorn. Let Oxford own, let Catalonia tell, What various victims to your wisdom fell; Let vows or benefits the vulgar bind, Such ties can never chain th'intrepid mind. Recorded be that memorable hour, When, to elude exasperated pow'r, With blushless front you durst your friend betray, Advise the whole confed'racy to stay, While with sly courage you run brisk away. By a deserted court with joy receiv'd, Your projects all admir'd, your oaths believ'd; Some trust obtain'd, of which good use he made, To gain a pardon where you first betray'd. But what is pardon to th'aspiring breast? You should have been first minister at least: Failing of that, forsaken and depress'd, Sure any soul but yours had sought for rest! And mourn'd in shades, far from the public eye, Successless fraud, and useless infamy. And here, my lord! let all mankind admire The efforts bold of unexhausted fire; You stand the champion of the people's cause, And bid the mob reform defective laws. Oh! was your pow'r, like your intention good, Your native land would stream with civic blood. I own these glorious schemes I view with pain; My little mischiefs to myself seem mean, Such ills are humble though my heart is great, All I can do is flatter, lie, and cheat; Yet I may say 'tis plain that you preside O'er all my morals, and 'tis much my pride To tread with steps unequal where you guide. My first subscribers I have first defam'd, And when detected, never was asham'd; Rais'd all the storms I could in private life, Whisper'd the husband to reform the wife; Outwitted Lintot in his very trade, And charity with obloquy repaid. Yet while you preach in prose, I scold in rhymes, Against th'injustice of flagitious times. You, learned doctor of the public stage, Give gilded poison to corrupt the age; Your poor toad-eater I, around me scatter My scurril jests, and gaping crowds bespatter. This may seem envy to the formal fools Who talk of virtue's bounds and honour's rules; We, who with piercing eyes look nature through, We know that all is right in all we do. Reason's erroneousâhonest instinct rightâ Monkeys were made to grin, and fleas to bite. Using the spite by the Creator given, We only tread the path that's mark'd by Heaven. And sure with justice 'tis that we exclaim, Such wrongs must e'en your modesty inflame; While blockheads, court-rewards and honours share, You, poet, patriot, and philosopher, No bills in pocket, nor no garter wear. When I see smoking on a booby's board Fat ortolans and pye of Perigord, Myself am mov'd to high poetic rage (The Homer and the Horace of the age), Puppies who have the insolence to dine With smiling beauties, and with sparkling wine; While I retire, plagu'd with an empty purse, Eat brocoli, and kiss my ancient nurse. But had we flourish'd when stern Harry reign'd, Our good designs had been but ill explain'd; The axe had cut your solid reas'nings short, I, in the porter's lodge, been scourg'd at court. To better times kind Heav'n reserv'd our birth. Happy for you such coxcombs are on earth! Mean spirits seek their villainy to hide; We show our venom'd souls with nobler pride, And in bold strokes have all mankind defy'd, Pass'd o'er the bounds that keep mankind in awe, And laugh'd at justice, liberty, and law. While our admirers stare with dumb surprise, Treason and scandal we monopolise. Yet this remains our more peculiar boast, You 'scape the block, and I the whipping-post. LADY HERTFORD, TO LORD WILLIAM HAMILTON. Dear Colin, prevent my warm blushes, Since how can I speak without pain? My eyes oft have told you my wishes, Why don't you their meaning explain? My passion will lose by expression, And you may too cruelly blame; Then do not expect a confession Of what is too tender to name. Since yours is the province of speaking, How can you then hope it from me? Our wishes should be in our keeping, 'Till yours tell us what they should be. Alas! then, why don't you discover? Did your heart feel such torments as mine, Eyes need not tell over and over, What I in my breast would confine. ANSWERED, FOR LORD WILLIAM HAMILTON, BY LADY M. W. MONTAGU. Good Madam, when ladies are willing, A man must needs look like a fool; For me, I would not give a shilling For one who would love out of rule. You should leave us to guess by your blushing, And not speak the matter so plain; 'Tis ours to write and be pushing, 'Tis yours to affect a disdain. That you're in a terrible taking, By all these sweet oglings I see; But the fruit that can fall without shaking, Indeed is too mellow for me. THE FOURTH ODE OF THE FIRST BOOK OF HORACE IMITATED. âSolvitur acris hyems gratÃ¢ vice veris,â &amp;c. Sharp winter now dissolv'd, the linnets sing, The grateful breath of pleasing Zephyrs bring The welcome joys of long-desired spring. The galleys now for open sea prepare, The herds forsake their stalls for balmy air, The fields adorn'd with green th'approaching sun declare. In shining nights the charming Venus leads Her troop of Graces, and her lovely maids, Who gaily trip the ground in myrtle shades. The blazing forge her husband Vulcan heats And thunderlike the labouring hammer beats, While toiling Cyclops every stroke repeats. Of myrtle new the cheerful wreath compose, Of various flowers which opening spring bestows, Till coming June presents the blushing rose. Pay your vow'd offering to God Faunus' bower! Then, happy Sestius, seize the present hour, 'Tis all that nature leaves to mortal power. The equal hand of strong impartial Fate Levels the peasant and th'imperious great, Nor will that doom on human projects wait. To the dark mansions of the senseless dead, With daily steps our destin'd path we tread, Realms still unknown, of which so much is said. Ended your schemes of pleasure and of pride, In joyous feasts no one will there preside, Torn from your Lycidas' beloved side. Whose tender youth does now our eyes engage, And soon will give, in his maturer age, Sighs to our virginsâto our matrons rage. ON SEEING A PORTRAIT OF SIR ROBERT WALPOLE. Such were the lively eyes and rosy hue Of Robin's face, when Robin first I knew; The gay companion and the favourite guest; Lov'd without awe, and without views caress'd; His cheerful smile, and open honest look, Added new graces to the truth he spoke. Then every man found something to commend, The pleasant neighbour and the worthy friend; The generous master of a private house, The tender father and indulgent spouse. The hardest censors at the worst believ'd, His temper was too easily deceiv'd (A consequential ill good-nature draws, A bad effect, but from a noble cause). Whence, then, these clamours of a judging crowd? Suspicious, griping, insolent, and proudâ Rapacious, cruel, violent, unjust; False to his friend, and traitor to his trust? THE BRIDE IN THE COUNTRY. A Parody on Rowe's Ballad, âDespairing beside a clear stream,â &amp;c. By the side of a half-rotten wood Melantha sat silently down, Convinc'd that her scheme was not good, And vex'd to be absent from Town. Whilst pitied by no living soul, To herself she was forc'd to reply, And the sparrow, as grave as an owl, Sat list'ning and pecking hard by. âAlas! silly maid that I was!â Thus sadly complaining, she cried; âWhen first I forsook that dear place, 'T had been better by far I had died! How gaily I pass'd the long days, In a round of continual delights; Park, visits, assemblies, and plays, And a dance to enliven the nights. âHow simple was I to believe Delusive poetical dreams! Or the flattering landscapes they give Of meadows and murmuring streams. Bleak mountains, and cold starving rocks, Are the wretched result of my pains; The swains greater brutes than their flocks, The nymphs as polite as the swains. âWhat though I have got my dear Phil; I see him all night and all day; I find I must not have my will, And I've cursedly sworn to obey! Fond damsel, thy power is lost As now I experience too late! Whatever a lover may boast, A husband is what one may hate! âAnd thou, my old woman, so dear, My all that is left of relief, Whatever I suffer, forbearâ Forbear to dissuade me from grief: 'Tis in vain, as you say, to repine At ills which cannot be redress'd; But, in sorrows so poignant as mine, To be patient, alas! is a jest. âIf, further to soothe my distress, Your tender compassion is led, Come hither and help to undress, And decently put me to bed. The last humble solace I wait, Would Heav'n but indulge me the boon, May some dream, less unkind than my fate, In a vision transport me to Town. âClarissa, meantime, weds a beau, Who decks her in golden array: She's the finest at ev'ry fine show, And flaunts it at Park and at Play: Whilst I am here left in the lurch, Forgot and secluded from view; Unless when some bumpkin at church Stares wistfully over the pew.â SONG. [Why should you think I live unpleas'd] Why should you think I live unpleas'd, Because I am not pleased with you? My mind is not so far diseas'd, To yield when powder'd fops pursue. My vanity can find no charm In common prostituted vows; Nor can you raise a wish that's warm In one that your true value knows. While cold and careless thus I shun The buzz and flutter that you make, Perhaps some giddy girl may run To catch the prize that I forsake. So brightly shines the glittering glare, In unexperienc'd children's eyes, When they with little arts ensnare The gaudy painted butterflies. While they with pride the conquest boast, And think the chase deserving care, Those scorn the useless toil they cost Who're us'd to more substantial fare. SONGâRONDEAU. Finish these languors! Oh! I'm sick Of dying airs, I know the trick; Long since I've learn'd to well explain Th'unmeaning cant of fire and pain, And see through all the senseless lies Of burning darts from killing eyes; I'm tir'd with this continual rout Of bowing low and leading out. Finish, &amp;c. Finish this tedious dangling trade, By which so many fools are made; For fools they are, whom you can please By such affected airs as these: At opera near my box to stand, And slyly press the given hand, Thus may you wait whole years in vain; But sure you would, were you in pain. Finish, &amp;c. EPITHALAMIUM. Since you, Mr. H?d, will marry black Kate, Accept of good wishes for that blessed state: May you fight all the day like a dog and a cat, And yet ev'ry year produce a new brat. Fal la! May she never be honestâyou never be sound; May her tongue like a clapper be heard a mile round; Till abandon'd by joy, and deserted by grace, You hang yourselves both in the very same place. Fal la! THE NINTH ODE OF THE THIRD BOOK OF HORACE IMITATED. 1736. âDonec gratus eram tibi.â SIR ROBERT WALPOLE. Whilst in each of my schemes you most heartily join'd, And help'd the worst jobs that I ever design'd, In pamphlets, in ballads, in senate, at table, Thy satire was witty, thy counsel was able. WILLIAM PULTENEY. Whilst with me you divided both profit and care, And the plunder and glory did equally share; Assur'd of his place, if my fat friend should die, The Prince of Wales was not so happy as I. SIR ROBERT WALPOLE. Harry Pelham is now my support and delight, Whom we bubble all day, and we joke on at night; His head is well furnish'd, his lungs have their merit, I would venture a rope to advance such a spirit. WILLIAM PULTENEY. I too have a Harry more useful than yours, Writes verses like mad, and will talk you whole hours; I would bleed by the hatchet, or swing by the cord, To see him once more in his robes, like a lord. SIR ROBERT WALPOLE. But what if this quarrel was kindly made up, Would you, my dear Willy, accept of a sup? If the queen should confess you had long been her choice, And you knew it was I who had spoke in her voice? WILLIAM PULTENEY. Though my Harry's so gay, so polite, and so civil, You rude as a bear, and more proud than the devil, I gladly would drop him, and laugh in your ear At the fools we have made for this last dozen year. A SUMMARY OF LORD LYTTLETON'S ADVICE TO A LADY. âThe counsels of a friend, Belinda, hear,â &amp;c. Be plain in dress, and sober in your diet; In short, my deary, kiss me! and be quiet. SONG. [Why will Delia thus retire] Why will Delia thus retire, And languish life away? Why the sighing crows admire, 'Tis too soon for hartshorn tea. All these dismal looks and fretting Cannot Damon's life restore; Long ago the worms have eat him, You can never see him more. Once again consult your toilet, In the glass your face review; So much weeping sure will spoil it, And no spring your charms renew. I, like you, was born a woman, Well I know what vapours mean! The disease, alas! is common, Single we have all the spleen. All the morals that they teach us Never cured our sorrows yet: Choose among the pretty fellows One of humour, youth, and wit. Prithee hear him ev'ry morning, At the least an hour or two; Once again at night returning, I believe the dose will do. THE POLITICIANS. In ancient days when every brute To humble privilege had right; Could reason, wrangle, or dispute, As well as scratch, and tear, and bite; When PhÅbus shone his brightest ray, The rip'ning corn his pow'r confess'd; His cheering beams made Nature gay, The eagle in his warmth was blest. But malcontents e'en then arose, The birds who love the dolesome night The darkest grove with care they chose, And there caball'd against the light. The screech-owl, with ill-boding cry, Portends strange things, old women say, Stops every fool that passes by, And frights the schoolboy from his play. The raven and the double bat, With families of owls combine; In close consult they rail and chat, And curse aloud the glorious shine. While the great planet, all serene, Heedless pursues his destin'd way, He asks not what these murmurs mean, But runs his course, and gives us day. BALLAD, ON A LATE OCCURRENCE. AMONG LADY M. W. MONTAGU'S MSS. Ungodly papers ev'ry week Poor simple souls persuade That courtiers good for nothing are, Or but for mischief made. But I who know their worthy hearts, Pronounce that we are blind, Who disappoint their honest schemes, Who would be just and kind. For in this vile degen'rate age 'Tis dang'rous to do good; Which will, when I have told my tale, Be better understood. A puppy, gamesome, blithe, and young, Who play'd about the court, Was destin'd by unlucky boys, To be their noonday's sport. With flatt'ring words they him entic'd, (Words such as much prevail!) And then with cruel art they tied A bottle to his tail. Lord Hervey at a window stood, Detesting of the fact; And cried aloud with all his might, âI know the bottle's crack'd. âDo not to such a dirty hole Let them your tail apply; Alas! you cannot know these things One half so well as I. âHarmless and young, you don't suspect The venom of this deed; But I see through the whole design,â It is to make you bleed.â This good advice was cast away; The puppy saw it shine; And tamely lick'd their treach'rous hands, And thought himself grown fine. But long he had not worn the gem, But, as Lord Hervey said, He ran and bled; the more he ran, Alas! the more he bled. Griev'd to the soul, this gallant lord Tripp'd hastily down stairs; With courage and compassion fir'd, To set him free prepares. But such was his ingratitude To this most noble lord, He bit his lily hand quite through, As he untied the cord. Next day the Maids of Honour came, As I heard people tell; They wash'd the wound with brinish tears, âAnd yet it is not well. Oh! gen'rous youth, my counsel take, And warlike acts forbear; Put on white gloves, and lead folks out, âFor that is your affair. Never attempt to take away Bottles from others' tails, For that is what no soul will bear From Italy to Wales. SONG. [Blame not that love, too cruel fair] Blame not that love, too cruel fair, Which your own charms did first create; Blame not my silence and despair,â Such crimes can ne'er deserve your hate: Why should your eyes first stir desire? Your matchless wit, why fan the fire? Repentance comes too late. Vain are the vows that you complain Are to another fondly made; All your advice to me's as vain; You must notâcannot be obey'd; My heart can't change, though you command, Nor can my heart obey your hand! Love's power none can evade! SONG. [Fond wishes you pursue in vain] Fond wishes you pursue in vain, My heart is vow'd away and gone; Forbear thy sighs, too, lovely swain, Those dying airs that you put on! Go try on other maids your art, Ah! leave this lost unworthy heart, But you must leave it soon. Such sighs as these you should bestow On some unpractis'd blooming fair; Where rosy youth doth warmly glow, Whose eyes forbid you to despair. Not all thy wond'rous charms can move A heart that must refuse your love, Or not deserve your care. IMPROMPTU, TO A YOUNG LADY SINGING. Sing, gentle maidâreform my breast, And soften all my care; Thus may I be some moments blest, And easy in despair. The pow'r of Orpheus lives in you; You can the passions of my soul subdue, And tame the lions and the tigers there. ADVICE. Cease, fond shepherdâcease desiring What you never must enjoy; She derides your vain aspiring, She to all your sex is coy. Cunning Damon once pursu'd her, Yet she never would incline; Strephon too as vainly woo'd her, Though his flocks are more than thine. At Diana's shrine aloud, By the zone around her waist, Thrice she bow'd, and thrice she vow'd Like the Goddess to be chaste. ANSWER. Though I never got possession, 'Tis a pleasure to adore; Hope, the wretch's only blessing, May in time procure me more. Constant courtship may obtain her,â Where both wealth and merit fail, And the lucky minute gain her,â Fate and fancy must prevail. At Diana's shrine aloud, By the bow and by the quiver, Thrice she bow'd, and thrice she vow'd, Once to loveâand that for ever. EPISTLE TO LORD HERVEY ON THE KING'S BIRTHDAY. FROM THE COUNTRY. Where I enjoy in contemplative chamber, Lutes, laurels, seas of milk, and ships of amber. Through shining crowds you now make way, With sideling bow and golden key; While wrapped in spleen and easy-chair, For all this pomp so small my care, I scarce remember who are there. Yet in brocade I can suppose The potent Knight whose presence goes At least a yard before his nose: And majesty with sweeping train, That does so many yards contain, Superior to her waiting nymphs, As lobster to attendant shrimps. I do not ask one word of news, Which country damsels much amuse. If a new batch of Lords appears, After a tour of half six years, With foreign years to grace the nation, The Maids of Honour's admiration; Whose bright improvements give surprise To their own lady-mother's eyes: Improvements, such as colts might show, Were mares so mad to let them go; Their limbs perhaps a little stronger, Their manes and tails grown somewhat longer. I would not hear of ball-room scuffles, Nor what new whims adorn the ruffles. This meek epistle comes to tell, On Monday, I in town shall dwell; Where, if you please to condescend In Cavendish-square to see your friend, I shall disclose to you alone Such thoughts as ne'er were thought upon. EPIGRAM, 1734. Born to be slaves, our fathers freedom sought, And with their blood the precious treasure bought; We their mean offspring our own bondage plot, And, born to freedom, for our chains we vote. WRITTEN AT LOVERE, OCTOBER, 1736. If age and sickness, poverty and pain, Should each assault me with alternate plagues, I know mankind is destin'd to complain, And I submit to torment and fatigues. The pious farmer, who ne'er misses pray'rs, With patience suffers unexpected rain; He blesses Heav'n for what its bounty spares, And sees, resign'd, a crop of blighted grain. But, spite of sermons, farmers would blaspheme, If a star fell to set their thatch on flame. CONCLUSION OF A LETTER TO A FRIEND. SENT FROM ITALY, 1741. But happy you from the contagion free, Who, through her veil, can human nature see; Calm you reflect, amid the frantic scene, On the low views of those mistaken men, Who lose the short invaluable hour, Through dirt-pursuing schemes of distant pow'r: Whose best enjoyments never pay the chase, But melt like snow within a warm embrace. Believe me, friend, for such indeed are you, Dear to my heart, and to my int'rest true; Too much already have you thrown away, Too long sustain'd the labour of the day; Enjoy the remnant of declining light, Nor wait for rest till overwhelm'd in night. By present pleasure balance pain you've past, Forget all systems, and indulge your taste. Wherever Fortune points my destin'd way, If my capricious stars ordain my stay In gilded palace, or in rural scene, While breath shall animate this frail machine, My heart sincere, which never flatt'ry knew, Shall consecrate its warmest wish to you. A monarch compass'd by a suppliant crowd, Prompt to obey, and in his praises loud, Among those thousands who on smiles depend, Perhaps has no disinterested friend. WRITTEN AT LOVERE, 1755. Wisdom, slow product of laborious years, The only fruit that life's cold winter bears; Thy sacred seeds in vain in youth we lay, By the fierce storm of passion torn away. Should some remain in a rich gen'rous soil, They long lie hid, and must be rais'd with toil; Faintly they struggle with inclement skies, No sooner born than the poor planter dies. LINES WRITTEN IN A BLANK PAGE OF MILTON'S PARADISE LOST. This happy pair a certain bliss might prove, Confined to constancy and mutual love: Heaven to one object limited their vows, The only safety faithless Nature knows. God saw the wand'ring appetite would range, And would have kept them from the power to change; But falsehood, soon as man increased, began; Down through the race the swift contagion ran, All ranks are tainted, all deceitful prove, False in all shapes, but doubly false in love. This makes the censure of the world more just, That damns with shame the weakness of a trust! Ere change began, our sex no scandal knew, All nymphs were chaste as long as swains were true; But now, tho' by the subtlest art betray'd, We're so by custom and false maxims sway'd That infamy still brands the injured maid. ADDRESSED TO ?, 1736. With toilsome steps I pass thro' life's dull road (No pack-horse half so tired of his load); And when this dirty journey will conclude, To what new realms is then my way pursued? Say, then does the unbodied spirit fly To happier climes and to a better sky? Or, sinking, mixes with its kindred clay, And sleeps a whole eternity away? Or shall this form be once again renewed, With all its frailties, all its hopes, endued; Acting once more on this detested stage Passions of youth, infirmities of age? I see in Tully what the ancients thought, And read unprejudiced what moderns taught; But no conviction from my reading springsâ Most dubious on the most important things. Yet one short moment would at once explain What all philosophy has sought in vain; Would clear all doubt, and terminate all pain. Why then not hasten that decisive hour; Still in my view, and ever in my power? Why should I drag along this life I hate, Without one thought to mitigate the weight? Whence this mysterious bearing to exist, When every joy is lost, and every hope dismissed? In chains and darkness wherefore should I stay, And mourn in prison whilst I keep the key?</field>
