      <field name="fulltext">TO IRIS AND ROSAMUND I. THE THINGS THAT MATTER. Now that I've nearly done my days, And grown too stiff to sweep or sew, I sit and think, till I'm amaze, About what lots of things I know: Things as I've found out one by one— And when I'm fast down in the clay, My knowing things and how they're done Will all be lost and thrown away. There's things, I know, as won't be lost, Things as folks write and talk about: The way to keep your roots from frost, And how to get your ink spots out. What medicine's good for sores and sprains, What way to salt your butter down, What charms will cure your different pains, And what will bright your faded gown. But more important things than these, They can't be written in a book: How fast to boil your greens and peas, And how good bacon ought to look; The feel of real good wearing stuff, The kind of apple as will keep, The look of bread that's rose enough, And how to get a child asleep. Whether the jam is fit to pot, Whether the milk is going to turn, Whether a hen will lay or not, Is things as some folks never learn. I know the weather by the sky, I know what herbs grow in what lane; And if sick men are going to die, Or if they'll get about again. Young wives come in, a-smiling, grave, With secrets that they itch to tell: I know what sort of times they'll have, And if they'll have a boy or gell. And if a lad is ill to bind, Or some young maid is hard to lead, I know when you should speak 'em kind, And when it's scolding as they need. I used to know where birds ud set, And likely spots for trout or hare, And God may want me to forget The way to set a line or snare; But not the way to truss a chick, To fry a fish, or baste a roast, Nor how to tell, when folks are sick, What kind of herb will ease them most! Forgetting seems such silly waste! I know so many little things, And now the Angels will make haste To dust it all away with wings! O God, you made me like to know, You kept the things straight in my head, Please God, if you can make it so, Let me know something when I'm dead. THE CONFESSION. I haven't always acted good: I've taken things not meant for me; Not other people's drink and food, But things they never seemed to see. I haven't done the way I ought If all they say in church is true, But all I've had I've fairly bought, And paid for pretty heavy too. For days and weeks are very long If you get nothing new and bright, And if you never do no wrong Somehow you never do no right. The chap that daresent go a yard For fear the path should lead astray May be a saint—though that seems hard, But he's no traveller, any way. Some things I can't be sorry for, The things that silly people hate; But some I did I do deplore, I knew, inside, they wasn't straight. And when my last account is filed, And stuck-up angels stop their song, I'll ask God's pardon like a child For what I really knew was wrong. If you've a child, you'd rather see A bit of temper, off and on, A greedy grab, a silly spree— And then a brave thing said or done Than hear your boy whine all day long About the things he musn't do: Just doing nothing, right or wrong: And God may feel the same as you. For God's our Father, so they say, He made His laws and He made me; He'll understand about the way Me and His laws could not agree. He might say, “You're worth more, My son, Than all My laws since law began. Take good with bad—here's something done— And I'm your God, and you're My man.” WORK. When I am busying about, Sewing on buttons, tapes, and strings, Hanging the week's wet washing out Or ironing the children's things, Sweeping and dusting, cleaning grates, Scrubbing the dresser or the floors, Washing the greasy dinner plates, Scouring the brasses on the doors— I wonder what it's all about, And when did people first begin To keep the dirt and wornness out And keep the wholesome comfort in: How long it is since women bore This round of wash and make and mend, And what God makes us do it for And whether it will ever end! When God began to do His work He made a new thing every day— Even now He is not one to shirk, But makes things, always some new way He made the earth, and sky, and sun, The creatures of the sea and wood, And when his first week's work was done He saw that it was very good. But He—for all He worked so fast To finish air, and wave, and shore, Knew that this work of His would last For ever and for evermore. On Saturday night He was content, He knew that Monday would not bring Need for another firmament, Another set of everything. But though my work is easier far Than making sky and sea and sun, It's harder than God's labours are, Because my work is never done. I sweep and churn, save and contrive, I bake and brew, I don't complain, But every Monday morning I've Last Monday's work to do again. I'm good at work—I work away; Always the same my work must go; The flowers grow different every day, That's why I like to see them grow. If, up in Heaven, God understood He'd let me for my Paradise Make all things new and very good And never make the same thing twice! THE JILTED LOVER TO HIS MOTHER. You needn't pray for me, old lady, I don't want no one's prayer, I'm fit and jolly as ever I was—you needn't think I care. When I go whistling down the road, when the warm night is falling, She needn't think I'm whistling her, it's another girl I'm calling. If I pass her house a dozen times, or fifty times a day, She needn't think I think of her, my work lies out that way. If they should tell her I've grown thin (for that is what they've told me) This cursèd weather counts for that, and not the girl who sold me. And if they say I'm off my feed I still can tip a can; If I get drunk what's that to her? I am not her young man. I know I've had a lucky let-off—she ain't no class, she ain't, For all she looked like a bush o' roses and talked like a story book saint. I never give a thought to her. Don't worry your old head, I've quite forgot her pretty ways and the cruel things she said, There's lots of other gals to be had as any chap can see, So you cheer up, you've got no call to go and pray for me. But all the same, if you want to pray, you'd best pray God to take care of them, For if I catch them two together, by hell! I'll swing for the pair of them. THE WILL TO LIVE. Since Faith is a veil that has nothing behind it, And Hope wanders lost where no mortal can find it, Since Love is a mirror we break in a minute In snatching the image our soul has cast in it, What is the use of the Summers and Springs, The wave of the woods and the waft of the wings— Since all means nothing, and good things and ill Make madness,— a mirage tormenting us still? Since all the fighting, the ardent endeavour, The heart cast bleeding to feed the Ideal, Are vain, vain, vain, and the one thing real Is that all's vain, for ever and ever; Why then, be a man and stand back from the strife, Fall by the sword, but keep out of the snare; Will but to be—and be willing to bear All that the gods may lay on you of life! In the far East, where light ever dawns first, There has man learned how the Fates may be cheated, How by our craft may their strength be defeated, Though all our best be no match for their worst! Kill the desire that they set in your bosom, Long not for fruit when you gaze on the blossom, Dream not of flowers when you gaze on the bud, Kill all the rebels that shout in your blood. Sorrow and sickness, disease and decay— These toll the hours of Life's desolate day; Hopes unfulfilled and forbidden delight These are the dreams of Life's treacherous night. So let me image an infinite peace Touched with no joy but the ease of release. Out of the eddies I climb and I cease Keeping, in change for this man's soul of me, Something which, by the eternal decree, Is as like Nothing as Something can be! Not to desire, to admire, to adore, Casting the robe of the soul that you wore Just as the soul casts the body's robe down. This is man's destiny, this is man's crown. This is the splendour, the end of the feast; This is the light of the Star in the East. So, Silence reconciles Life's jarring phrases Far in the future, austere and august: Meanwhile, the buds of the poplars are falling, Spring's on the lawn, and a little voice calling: “Daddy, come out! Daddy darling, you must! Daddy come out and help Molly pick daisies!” And, since one's here, and the Spring's in the garden (How many lives hence will that thought earn pardon?) Since one's a man and man's heart is insistent, And, since Nirvana is doubtful and distant, Though life's a hard road and thorny to travel— Stones in the borders and grass on the gravel, Still there's the wisdom that wise men call folly, Still one can go and pick daisies with Molly! THE BEATIFIC VISION. Oh God! if I do my duty And walk in the thorny way, Will you pay me with heavens of beauty, Millions of lives away? Will you give me the music of heaven, And the joy that none understands, In place of what life would have given If I had held out my hands? I have lived in a narrow prison, I have writhed 'neath a bitter creed, And I dare to say that no heaven can pay The renouncèd dream and deed, But when my life's portal closes, If you have no heaven to spare God! give me a garden of roses, And some one to walk with there. II. MUMMY WHEAT. Laid close to Death, these many thousand years, In this small seed Life hid herself and smiled; So well she hid, Death was at last beguiled, Set free the grain—and lo! the sevenfold ears! Warmed by the sun, wooed by the wind's soft word, Under blue canopy they hold their state: For this, ah, was it not worth while to wait Through all the centuries of hope deferred? What could they know who laid the seed with Death Of this Divine fruition fixed and planned? Love—since Life parts us—lend my hand your hand And look with me into the eyes of faith. For here between your hand and mine there lies A little seed we trust to Death to keep Through unimagined centuries of sleep Until the day when Life shall bid it rise. Our harvest waits us. Who knows where or how, What worlds away, wrapped in what coil of pain? But Life shall bid us pluck gold sevenfold grain Grown from the love she bids us bury now. THE BEECH TREE. My beautiful beech, your smooth grey coat is trimmed With letters. Once, each stood for all things dear To foolish lovers, dead this many a year, Whose lamp of lighted love so soon was dimmed. You have seen them come and go, And heard their kisses and vows Under your boughs, The pitiful vows they swore, Have seen their poor tears flow, Have seen them part; to meet, and to return, no more! And in old winters, through your branches bare, The north wind drove the blue home-scented smoke That on the glowing Christmas hearth awoke Where the old logs, with eager flicker and flare, Sang their low crackling song Of peace and of good will. The old song is still, The old voices have died away, The hearth has been cold so long, And the bright faces dimmed and covered up with clay. And summer after summer wakes to glow The ordered pleasance with the clipped box-hedge, The drooping lilac by the old moat's edge, The roses, that throw you kisses from below, The orchard pink and white, The sedge's whispered words, The nesting birds, All these return to revel round your feet. And in the untroubled night The nightingale still sings, the jasmine still is sweet. My beautiful beech, I carve upon you here The master-letter which begins her name Through whom, to me, the royal summer came, And nightingale and rose, and all things dear. And, in some far-off time, I shall come here, weary and old, When the hearth in my heart is cold And the birds that nest there flown; I will remember this summer in all its prime And say, “There was a day— Thank God, the Giver, an unforgotten day, When I walked here, not alone, —O God of pity and sorrow, not alone!” IN ABSENCE. Wake, do you wake in the dark in the strange far place, Window and door not set like the ones we knew, Leaning your face through the dark for another face, Stretching your arms to the arms that are far from you, Even as I, through the depth of this darkness, do? Sleep, do you sleep in the house in the lonely land? In the lonely room do you hear no steps draw near? Do you miss in the darkness the hand that implores your hand, See through the darkness your last dream disappear, And weep, as I weep, in the outer darkness here? Dream, do you dream? Nay, never a dream will stay, Never a phantom is fond, or a vision kind. Your dreams elude you and fly through the dark my way, My dreams fly forth to you whom they may not find; And we in the darkness weep, we weep and are left behind. SILENCE. So silent is the world to-night The lamp gives silence out like light, The latticed windows open wide Show silence, like the night, outside: The nightingale's faint song draws near Like musical silence to mine ear. The empty house calls not to me, “Here, but for fate, were thou and she—” Its gibe for once is checked. To-night Silence is queen in grief's despite, And even the longing of my soul Is silent 'neath this hour's control. RAISON D'ÊTRE. O weary night, O weary day, When heart's delight is far away! What is the day? A frame of blue The vacant-glaring sun grins through. What is the night? A sable veil Through which the moon peers tired and pale. O weary day! O weary night! How far away is heart's delight! Love hung the sun in his high place To give me light to see her face, And love spread out the veil of night To hide us two from all men's sight. O kindly night, O pleasant day, Your use is gone—why should ye stay? My heart's delight is far away, O weary night, O weary day. THE ONLOOKER. If I could make a pillow for your head, Soft, pleasant, filled with every pretty thought; If I could lay a carpet where you tread Of all my life's most radiant fancies wrought, And spread my love as canopy above you, Your sleep, your steps should know how much I love you. But—as life goes, to the old sorry tune— I stand apart, I see thorns wound your feet, Your sleeping eyes resenting sun and moon, Your head lie restless on a breast unmeet— And say no word, and suffer without moan, Lest you should guess how much you are alone. THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE. I plucked the blossoms of delight In many a wood and many a field, I made a garland fair and bright As any gardens yield. But when I sought the living tree To make new earth and Heaven new, I found—alas for you and me— Its roots were set in you. Oh, dear my garden, where the fruit Of lovely knowledge sweetly springs, How jealously you guard the root Of all enlightening things! AT PARTING. And you could leave me now— After the first remembered whispered vow Which sings for ever and ever in my ears— The vow which God among His Angels hears— After the long-drawn years, The slow hard tears, Could break new ground, and wake A new strange garden to blossom for your sake, And leave me here alone, In the old garden that was once our own? How should I learn to bear Our garden's pleasant ways and pleasant air, Her flowers, her fruits, her lily, her rose and thorn, When only in a picture these appear— These, once alive, and always over-dear? Ah—think again: the rose you used to wear Must still be more than other roses be The flower of flowers. Ah, pity, pity me! For in my acres is no plot of ground Whereon could any garden site be found, I have but little skill To water weed and till And make the desert blossom like the rose; Yet our old garden knows If I have loved its ways and walks and kept The garden watered, and the pleasance swept. Yet—if you must—go now: Go, with my blessing filling both your hands, And, mid the desert sands Which life drifts deep round every garden wall, Make your new festival Of bud and blossom—red rose and green leaf. No blight born of my grief Shall touch your garden, love; but my heart's prayer Shall draw down blessings on you from the air, And all we learned of leaf and plant and tree Shall serve you when you walk no more with me In garden ways; and when with her you tread The pleasant ways with blossoms overhead And when she asks, “How did you come to know The secrets of the ways these green things grow?” Then you will answer—and I, please God, hear, “I had another garden once, my dear”. SONG. [I hear the waves to-night] I hear the waves to-night Piteously calling, calling, Though the light Of the kind moon is falling, Like kisses, on the sea That calls for sunshine, dear, as my soul calls for thee. I see the sea lie gray Wrinkling her brows in sorrow, Hear her say:— “Bright love of yesterday, return to-morrow, Sun, I am thine, am thine!” Oh sea, thy love will come again, but what of mine? RENUNCIATION. Rose of the desert of my heart, Moon of the night that is my soul, Thou can'st not know how sweet thou art, Nor what wild tides thy beams control. For all thy heart a garden is, Thy soul is like a dawn of May. And garden and dawn might both be his, Who from them both must turn away. Oh, garden of the Spring's delight! Oh, dewy dawn of perfect noon! I will not pluck thy roses white Or warm thy May-time into June. I can but bless thee, moon and rose, And journey far and very far To where the night no moonbeam shows, To where no happy roses are! III. THE VEIL OF MAYA. Sweet, I have loved before. I know This longing that invades my days; This shape that haunts life's busy ways I know since long and long ago. This starry mystery of delight That floats across my eager eyes, This pain that makes earth Paradise, These magic songs of day and night— I know them for the things they are: A passing pain, a longing fleet, A shape that soon I shall not meet, A fading dream of veil and star. Yet, even as my lips proclaim The wisdom that the years have lent, Your absence is joy's banishment, And life's one music is your name. I love you to my heart's hid core: Those other loves? how should one learn From marshlights how the great fires burn? Ah, no! I never loved before! SONG. [The sunshine of your presence lies] The sunshine of your presence lies On the glad garden of my heart, And bids the leaves of silence part To show the flowers to your dear eyes, And flower on flower blooms there and dies And still new buds awakened spring, For sunshine makes the garden wise, To know the time for blossoming. Night is no time for blossoming, Your garden then dreams otherwise, Of vanished Summer, vanished Spring, And how the dearest flower first dies. Yet from your ministering eyes Though night hath drawn me far apart On the still garden of my heart The moonlight of your memory lies. TO VERA, WHO ASKED A SONG. If I only had time! I could make you a rhyme. But my time is kept flying By smiling and sighing And living and dying for you. The song-seed, I sow it, I water and hoe it, But never can grow it. Ah, traitress, you know it! What is a poor poet to do? Ah, let me take breath! I am harried to death By the loves and the graces That crowd where your face is That lurk in your laces and throng. Call them off for a minute, Once let me begin it The devil is in it If I can not spin it As sweet as a linnet, your song! THE POET TO HIS LOVE. All the flight of thoughts here, shy, bold, scared, intrusive, Fluttering in the sun, between the green and blue, Wheeling, whirling, poising, lovely and elusive, How to cage the flying thoughts, my winged delight, for you? Set a springe of rhyme, and hope to catch them in it? Strew my love as grain to lure them to the snare? Watch the hours built up, slow minute piled on minute? Still the wide sky guards their flight, and still the cage is bare. Gleam of hovering feathers, brushing me to flout me! Wings, be weary! Rest! Who loves you more than I? Caught? Oh fluttering pinions whitening air about me! Rustling wings, and distant flight, and empty cage and sky! THE MAIDEN'S PRAYER. Spring, pretty Spring, what treasure do you bring to me? Green grass and buttercups, cherry-bloom and may? Sunshine to be glad with me, and little birds to sing to me? Warm nests to call me along the woodland way? Spring, happy Spring, what wonder will you do for me? Light the tulip lanterns, and set the furze a-fire? Fill your sky with sails of cloud on waves of living blue for me? Show me green cornfields and budding of the briar? Spring, darling Spring, my days will not return to me, You who see them fleeting, you, all time above, You who move the whole world's heart, ah move one heart to turn to me, —Bring me a lover, and teach me how to love! SONG. [“Love me little, love me long,”] “Love me little, love me long,” Is the burden of my song, And if nothing more may be Little shall suffice for me. But if you would crown with flowers All my radiant, festal hours, And console for hours of sorrow Love me more with each to-morrow. And if you would turn my days To one splendid hymn of praise, And set hopes like stars above me Love me much, and always love me! THE MAGIC FLOWER. Through many days and many days The seed of love lay hidden close; We walked the dusty tiresome ways Where never a leaf or blossom grows. And in the darkness, all the while, The little seed its heart uncurled, And we by many a weary mile Travelled towards it, round the world. To the hid centre of the maze At last we came, and there we found— O happy day, O day of days! —Twin seed-leaves breaking holy ground. We dropped life's joys, a garnered sheaf, And spell-bound watched, still hour by hour, Magic on magic, leaf by leaf, The unfolding of our love's white flower. LA DERNIÈRE ROBE DE SOIE. Oh, silken gown, all pink and pretty, Bought, quite a bargain, in the City, Your ill-trained soul full false has played me— No Paris gown would have betrayed me. You knew, my pretty silken treasure, I must not wed for love or pleasure, But for a settlement and title; Yet you encouraged his recital! He said—oh, faithless gown, you listened While on your sheen two tear drops glistened— He said let love to music set it, I'll never speak it—nor forget it! “No, no!” I cried, I tried to save you— False gown, you showed the tears I gave you! You looked discreet when first I found you. How could you let his arm go round you? You darling dress—I'll smooth your creases, I'll wear you till you drop to pieces; But poor men's wives wear cotton only— Dear gown—I hope you won't feel lonely! THE LEAST POSSIBLE. Dear goddess of the shining shrine Where all my votive tapers burn, Where every gold-embroidered thought And all my flowers of life are brought —With many, alas! that are not mine— What will you give me in return? The bow in Bond Street—in the Park The smile all worship on your lips, The courteous word at dinner—dance— But never a blush—a conscious glance; At most, at Henley, in the dark, Your fleet mistaken finger-tips? Ah, just for once, once only, be An altar-server—stoop and set me Upon the altar richly wrought Of your most secret flower-sweet thought: One nightlight's flicker burn for me Before you sleep and quite forget me. EN TOUT CAS. When I am glad I need your eyes To be the stars of Paradise; Your lips to be the seal of all The joy life grants, and dreams recall; Your hand, to lie my hands between What time we walk the garden green. But most in grief I need your face To lean to mine in the desert place; Your lips to mock the evil years, To sweeten me my cup of tears, Your eyes to shine, in cloud's despite, Your hands to hold mine through the night. APPEAL. Daphnis dearest, wherefore weave me Webs of lies lest truth should grieve me? I could pardon much, believe me: Dower me, Daphnis, or bereave me, Kiss me, kill me, love me, leave me,— Damn me, dear, but don't deceive me! ST. VALENTINE'S DAY. The South is a dream of flowers With a jewel for sky and sea, Rose-crowns for the dancing hours, Gold fruits upon every tree; But cold from the North The wind blows forth That blows my love to me. The stars in the South are gold Like lamps between sky and sea; The flowers that the forests hold Like stars between tree and tree; But little and white Is the pale moon's light That lights my love to me. In the South the orange grove Makes dusk by the dusky sea, White palaces wrought for love Gleam white between tree and tree, But under bare boughs Is the little house Warm-lit for my love and me. CHAGRIN D'AMOUR. If Love and I were all alone I might forget to grieve, And for his pleasure and my own Might happier garlands weave; But you sit there, and watch us wear The mourning wreaths you wove: And while such mocking eyes you bear I am not friends with Love. Withdraw those cruel eyes, and let Me search the garden through That I may weave, ere Love be set, The wreath of Love for you; Till you, whom Love so well adorns, Its hidden thorns discover, And know at last what crown of thorns It was you gave your lover. BRIDAL EVE. Good-night, my Heart, my Heart, good-night— Oh, good and dear and fair, With lips of life and eyes of light And roses in your hair. To-morrow brings the other crown, The orange blossoms, Sweet, And then the rose will be cast down With lilies at your feet. But in your soul a garden stands Where fair the white rose blows— God, teach my foolish clumsy hands The way to tend my rose That in the white-rose garden still The lily may bloom fair God help my heart and soul and will To keep the lily there. LOVE AND LIFE. Love only sings when Love is young, When Love is young and still at play, How shall we count the sweet songs sung When Love and Joy kept holiday? But now Love has to earn his bread By lifelong stress and toil of tears, He finds his nest of song-birds dead That sang so sweet in other years. For Love's a man now, strong and brave, To fight for you, for you to live, And Love, that once such bright songs gave Has better things than songs to give; He gives you now a lifelong faith, A hand to help in joy or pain, And he will sing no more, till Death Shall come to make him young again! FROM THE ITALIAN. As a little child whom his mother has chidden, Wrecked in the dark in a storm of weeping, Sleeps with his tear-stained eyes close hidden And, with fists clenched, sobs still in his sleeping, So in my breast sleeps Love, O white lady, What does he care though the rest are playing, With rattles and drums in the woodlands shady, Happy children, whom Joy takes maying! Ah, do not wake him, lest you should hear him Scolding the others, breaking their rattles, Smashing their drums, when their play comes near him— Love who, for me, is a god of battles! IV. “OUT OF THE FULNESS OF THE HEART THE MOUTH SPEAKETH.” In answer to those who have said that English Poets give no personal love to their country. England, my country, austere in the clamorous council of nations, Set in the seat of the mighty, wielding the sword of the strong, Have we but sung of your glory, firm in eternal foundations? Are not your woods and your meadows the core of our heart and our song? O dear fields of my country, grass growing green, glowing golden, Green in the patience of winter, gold in the pageant of spring, Oaks and young larches awaking, wind-flowers and violets blowing, What, if God sets us to singing, what save you shall we sing? Who but our England is fair through the veil of her poets' praises, What but the pastoral face, the fruitful, beautiful breast? Are not your poets' meadows starred with the English daisies? Were not the wings of their song-birds fledged in an English nest? Songs of the leaves in the sunlight, songs of the fernbrake in shadow, Songs of the world of the woods and songs of the marsh and the mere, Are they not English woods, dear English marshland and meadow? Have not your poets loved you? England, are you not dear? Shoulders of upland brown laid dark to the sunset's bosom, Living amber of wheat, and copper of new-ploughed loam, Downs where the white sheep wander, little gardens in blossom, Roads that wind through the twilight up to the lights of home. Lanes that are white with hawthorn, dykes where the sedges shiver, Hollows where caged winds slumber, moorlands where winds wake free, Sowing and reaping and gleaning, spring and torrent and river, Are they not more, by worlds, then the whole of the world can be? Is there a corner of land, a furze-fringed rag of a by-way, Coign of your foam-white cliffs or swirl of your grass-green waves, Leaf of your peaceful copse, or dust of your strenuous highway, But in our hearts is sacred, dear as our cradles, our graves? Is not each bough in your orchards, each cloud in the skies above you, Is not each byre or homestead, furrow or farm or fold, Dear as the last dear drops of the blood in the hearts that love you, Filling those hearts till the love is more than the heart can hold? Therefore the song breaks forth from the depths of the hidden fountain Singing your least frail flower, your raiment of seas and skies, Singing your pasture and cornfield, fen and valley and mountain, England, desire of my heart, England, delight of mine eyes! Take my song too, my country: many a son and debtor Pays you in praise and homage out of your gifts' full store; Life of my life, my England, many will praise you better, None, by the God that made you, ever can love you more! SUMMER SONG. There are white moon daisies in the mist of the meadow Where the flowered grass scatters its seeds like spray, There are purple orchis by the wood-ways' shadow, There are pale dog-roses by the white highway; And the grass, the grass is tall, the grass is up for hay, With daisies white like silver and buttercups like gold, And its oh! for once to play thro' the long, the lovely day, To laugh before the year grows old! There is silver moonlight on the breast of the river Where the willows tremble to the kiss of night, Where the nine tall aspens in the meadow shiver, Shiver in the night wind that turns them white. And the lamps, the lamps are lit, the lamps the glow-worms light, Between the silver aspens and the west's last gold. And it's oh! to drink delight in the lovely lonely night, To be young before the heart grows old! THE LOWER ROOM. How soft the lamplight falls On pictures, books, And pleasant coloured walls And curtains drawn! How happily one looks On glowing flame and ember; Ah, why should one remember Dew and the dawn! Here age and wisdom sit Calm and discreet, Life and the fruit of it Are here in truth, Whose gathering once was sweet— Wisdom and age! Well met! Yet neither can forget Folly and youth! SONG. [The summer down the garden walks] The summer down the garden walks Swept in her garments bright; She touched the pale still lily stalks And crowned them with delight; She breathed upon the rose's head And filled its heart with fire, And with a golden carpet spread The path of my desire. The larkspurs stood like sentinels To greet her as she came, Soft rang the Canterbury bells The music of her name. She passed across the happy land Where all dear dreams flower free; She took my true love by the hand And led her out to me. MAY SONG. Birds in the green of my garden, Blackbirds and throstle and wren, Wet your dear wings in the tears that are Spring's, And so to your singing again! Birds in my blossoming orchard, Chaffinch and goldfinch and lark, Preen your bright wings, little happy live things; The May trees grow white in the park! Birds in the leafy wet woodlands, Cuckoo and nightingale brown, Sing to the sound of the rain on green ground— The rain on green leaves dripping down! Fresh with the rain of the May-time, Rich with the promise of June, Deep in her heart, where the little leaves part, Love, like a bird, sings in tune! V. TO IRIS. If I might build a palace, fair With every joy of soul and sense, And set my heart as sentry there To guard your happy innocence— If I might plant a hedge so strong No creeping sorrow could writhe through, And find my whole life not too long To give, to make your hedge for you— If I could teach the wandering air To bring no sounds that were not sweet, Could teach the earth that only fair Untrodden flowers deserved your feet: Would I not tear the secret scroll Where all your griefs lie closely curled, And give your little hand control Of all the joys of all the world? But ah! I have no skill to raise The palace, teach the hedge to grow; The common airs blow through your days, By common ways your dear feet go. And you must twine of common flowers The wreath that happy women wear, And bear in desolate darkened hours The common griefs that all men bear. The pinions of my love I fold Your little shoulders close about: Ah—could my love keep out the cold And shut the creeping sorrows out! Rough paths will tire your darling feet, Gray skies will weep your tears above, While round you still, in torment, beat The impotent wings of mother-love. TO A CHILD. (Rosamund.) The fairies have been busy while you slept; They have been laughing where the sad rain wept, They have taught Beauty to the ignorant flowers, Set tasks of hope to weary wind-torn bowers, And heard the lessons learned in school-rooms cold By seedling snapdragon and marigold. At dawn, while still you slept, I grew aware How good the fairies are, how many and fair. The fairy whose delightful gown is red Across a corner of our garden sped, And, where her flying raiment fluttered past, Its roseate reflection still is cast: Red poppies by the rhododendron's side, Pæonies gorgeous in their summer pride, And red may-bushes by the old red wall Shower down their crimson petals over all. Then she whose gown is gold, and gold her hair, Swept down the golden steep straight sunbeam-stair, She lit the tulip-lamps, she lit the torch Of hollyhock beside the cottage porch. She dressed the honeysuckle in fringe of gold, She gave the king-cups fairy wealth to hold, She kissed St. John's wort till it opened wide, She set the yarrow by the river side. Then came the lady all whose robes are white: She made the pale buds blossom in delight, Set silver stars upon the jasmine's hair, And gave the stream white lily-buds to wear. She painted lilies white, and pearl-white phlox, White poppies, passion-flowers and gray-leaved stocks. Her pure kind touch redeemed the most forlorn, And even the vile petunia smiled, new-born. The dearest fairy of all—green is her gown— She kissed the plane-trees in the tiresome town, She smoothed the pastures and the lawn's pale sheen, She decked the boughs with hangings fresh and green, She showed each flower the one and only way Its beauty of shape and colour to display; She taught the world to be a Paradise Of changing leaf and blade, for tirèd eyes. Then, one and all, they came where you were laid In your strait bed, my little lovely maid; The red-robed fairy kissed your lips, your face, The white-robed made your heart her dwelling-place. Into your eyes the green robed fairy smiled; The golden fairy touched your dreams, my child, And one, not named, but mightiest, made my Dear The innermost rose of the re-flowerèd year. May, 1898. BIRTHDAY TALK FOR A CHILD. (IRIS.) Daddy dear, I'm only four And I'd rather not be more: Four's the nicest age to be— Two and two, or one and three. All I love is two and two, Mother, Fabian, Paul and you; All you love is one and three, Mother, Fabian, Paul and me. Give your little girl a kiss Because she learned and told you this. TO ROSAMUND. And it is fair and very fair This maze of blossom and sweet air, This drift of orchard snows, This royal promise of the rose Wherein your young eyes see Such buds of scented joys to be. A gay green garden, softly fanned By the blythe breeze that blows To speed your ship of dreams to the enchanted land. But I—beyond the budding screen Of green and red and white and green, Behind the radiant show Of things that cling and grow and glow I see the plains where lie The hopes of days gone by: Gray breadths of melancholy, crossed By winds that coldly blow From that cold sea wherein my argosy is lost. FROM THE TUSCAN. When in the west the red sun sank in glory, The cypress trees stood up like gold, fine gold; The mother told her little child the story Of the gold trees the heavenly gardens hold. In golden dreams the child sees golden rivers, Gold trees, gold blossoms, golden boughs and leaves, Without, the cypress in the night wind shivers, Weeps with the rain and with the darkness grieves. MOTHER SONG. From the Portuguese. Heavy my heart is, heavy to carry, Full of soft foldings, of downy enwrapments— And the outer fold of all is love, And the next soft fold is love, And the next, finer and softer, is love again; And were they unwound before the eyes More folds and more folds and more folds would unroll Of love—always love, And, quite at the last, Deep in the nest, in the soft-packed nest, One last fold, turned back, would disclose You, little heart of my heart, Laid there so warm, so soft, so soft, Not knowing where you lie, nor how softly, Nor why your nest is so soft, Nor how your nest is so warm. You, little heart of my heart, You lie in my heart, Warm, safe and soft as this body of yours, This dear kissed body of yours that lies Here in my arms and sucks the strength from my breast, The strength you will break my heart with one of these days. VI. THE ISLAND. Does the wind sing in your ears at night, in the town, Rattling the windows and doors of the cheap-built place? Do you hear its song as it flies over marsh and down? Do you feel the kiss that the wind leaves here on my face? Or, wrapt in a lamplit quiet, do you restrain Thoughts that would take the wind's way hither to me, And bid them rest safe-anchored, nor tempt again The tumult, and torment, and passion that live in the sea? I, for my part, when the wind sings loud in its might, I bid it hush—nor awaken again the storm That swept my heart out to sea on a moonless night, And dashed it ashore on an island wondrous and warm Where all things fair and forbidden for ever flower, Where the worst of life is a dream, and the best comes true, Where the harvest of years was reaped in a single hour And the gods, for once, were honest with me and you. I will not hear when the wind and the sea cry out, I will not trust again to the hurrying wind, I will not swim again in a sea of doubt, And reach that shore with the world left well behind; But you,—I would have you listen to every call Of the changing wind, as it blows over marsh and main, And heap life's joys in your hands, and offer them all, If only your feet might touch that island again! POSSESSION. The child was yours and none of mine, And yet you gave it me to keep, And bade me sew it raiment fine, And wrap my kisses round its sleep. I carried it upon my breast, I fed it in a world apart, I wrapped my kisses round its rest, I rocked its cradle with my heart. When in mad nights of rain and storm You turned us homeless from your door, I wrapped it close, I kept it warm, And brought it safe to you once more. But the last time you drove us forth, The snow was wrapped about its head, That night the wind blew from the North, And on my heart the child was dead. The child is mine and none of yours, My life was his while he had breath, What of your claim to him endures, Who only gave him birth and death? ACCESSION. Once I loved, and my heart bowed down, Subject and slave, for Love was a King; He sat above with sceptre and crown, Turning his eyes from my sorrowing. The laugh of a god on his lips lay light— His lips victorious that mocked my pain, And I mourned in the cold and the outer night, And my tears and my prayers were vain. Now the old spell is over and done, Myself I wear the ermine and gold, My brows are crowned, I ascend the throne, I have taken the sceptre and orb to hold. I smile victorious, set far above The music of voices that moan and pray, My feet are wet with the tears of love, And I turn my eyes away. THE DESTROYER. Across the quiet pastures of my soul The invading army marched in splendid might My few poor forces fled beyond control, Scattered, defeated, hidden in the night. My fields were green, their hedges white with May, With gold of buttercups made bright and fair, The careless conquerors did not even stay To gather one of all the blossoms there. Only when they had passed, the fields were brown, The grass and blossoms trampled in the mud: The flowering hedges withered and torn down, And no one richer by a single bud. THE EGOISTS. Two strangers, from opposing poles, Meet in the torrid zone of Love: And their desire seems set above The limitation of their souls. This is the trap; this is the snare, This is the false, enchanting light, And when it smoulders into night, How can each know the other there? They own no bond of common speech; Each, from far shores by wild winds brought, Gropes for some cord of common thought To draw the other within reach. Each when the dark tide drowns their star, Cries out, “Thou art not one with me: One flesh we seemed when eyes could see, But now, how far thou art! How far!” Each calling, “Come! be mine! be wise!” Stands obstinately in his place, How can these two come face to face, Till light spring from their meeting eyes? Could both but once cry, “Far thou art, But I am coming!” How the beat Of waves that part them would retreat, Resurge and find them, heart to heart! THE WAY OF LOVE. The butterfly loves the rose, He flutters around her bed, Till the soft curled leaves unclose, And she raises her darling head. He whispers of dawn and of dew, Of love, and the heart of love, Of worship, timid and true, And she takes no joy thereof. But when, through the noon's blind heat, The arrogant bee flaunts by, She yields him her heart's hid sweet, And he leaves her alone, to die. The depth of her dying bliss Her grief-white butterfly knows: And the bee laughs low in the kiss Of another, a redder rose. TO ONE WHO PLEADED FOR CANDOUR IN LOVE. Here in the dim enchanted wood Your face, a mystery divine, But half revealed, half understood, Appears the counterpart of mine. Beyond the wood the daylight lies; Cruel and hard, it lies in wait To steal the magic from your eyes And from your lips the thrill of fate. Ah, stay with me a little while Here, where the magic shadows rest, Where all my world is in your smile And all my heaven on your breast. Ah no!—cling close, what need to move, What need to advance or to explore? We came here blindly, led by love, Who will not lead us any more. Thank God that here we two have stood, Thank God this shade was ours to win; Time with his axe has marked our wood And he will let the daylight in. THE ENCHANTED GARDEN. Oh, what a garden it was, living gold, living green, Full of enchantments like spices embalming the air, There, where you fled and I followed—you ever unseen, Yet each glad pulse of me cried to my heart, “She is there!” Roses and lilies and lilies and roses again, Tangle of leaves and white magic of blossoming trees, Sunlight that lay where, last moment, your footstep had lain— Was not the garden enchanted that proffered me these? Ah, what a garden it is since I caught you at last— Scattered the magic and shattered the spell with a kiss: Wintry and dreary and cold with the wind of the past, Ah that a garden enchanted should wither to this! THE POOR MAN'S GUEST. One came to me in royal guise With banners flying fair and free; But many griefs had made me wise And I refused to bow the knee. Then one drew near who bore the flower Of all the flowers of June and May; But many griefs had lent me power And I was strong to turn away. Then came a beggar to my gate With shoulders bowed to sorrow's pack, So weary and so desolate I had no heart to turn him back. I let him share my board, my bed, I warmed him in my shrinking breast, I gave him all I had, and said: “You, only you, have been my guest. “Love passed in many a fair disguise But never could an entrance win, But you came in such piteous wise, Poor friend, I could but let you in.” Low laughed my guest: “Kind friend!” said he, And dropped the rags he was weary of; And I, betrayed, saw over me The terrible face of outraged Love. IN THE SHALLOWS. Among the shallows where the sand Is golden and the waves are small, I love to lie, and to my hand How many little treasures fall! What shells and seaweed grace the shore, What happy birds on happy wings, And for companions, what a store Of humble, happy, living things! Yet the sea's depths are also mine, And in the old days I used to dive Into the caves, where corals shine And where the shimmering mer-folk live. I am the master of the sea In deeps where fairy flowers uncurl; That treasure-house belongs to me, Those amber halls, those stairs of pearl. But now thereto I go no more, Because of all the argosies, Deep sunk upon the ocean floor, Where all the world's lost treasure lies. Where loveless laughter curls the lips Of wild sea creatures at their sport About the bones of noble ships, My ships, that never came to port. “AND THE RAINS DESCENDED AND THE FLOODS CAME.” Now the far waves roll nearer and more near, The wind's awake, the pitiless wind's awake, It shrieks the menace that I dare not hear, Soon at my feet the angry waves will break In desolating wrath—and here I stand Helpless; my house is built upon the sand. O you, whose house upon a rock is set, Laugh, safe and sure, at threatening wave and wind. You chose the better part and yet—and yet, There was no other ground that I could find, And I was weary and I longed to raise A house to guard my shivering nights and days. And it was pleasant in the house I made, While still the floods and winds were held asleep. I blessed it at the dawn, at night I prayed As though its dear foundations had been deep Sunk in the rock. I whispered in surmise, “What if winds never wake, floods never rise?” And now the waves are near and very near, And here I wait and wonder which may be The wave in which my house will disappear, My little house that loved and sheltered me, Where joy still sings, her garland in her hand, Built on the sand, oh God, built on the sand! THE STAR. I had a star to sing by, a beautiful star that led, But when I sang of its splendour the world in its wisdom said: “Sweet are your songs, yet the singer sings but in madness when He hymns but stars unbeholden of us his fellows of men; Glow-worms we see and marshlights; sing us sweet songs of those For the guerdons we have to give you, laurel and gold and rose; Or if you must sing of stars, unseen of your brother man, Go, starve with your eyes on your vision; your star may save if it can!” So I said, “If I starve and die I never again shall see The glory, the high white radiance that hallows the world for me; I will sing their songs, if it must be, and when I have golden store, I will turn from the marsh and the glow-worms, and sing of my star once more.” So I walked in the warm wet by-ways, not daring to lift my eyes Lest love should drive me to singing my star supreme in the skies, And the world cried out, “We will crown him, he sings of the lights that are, Glories of marshlight and glow-worm, not visions vain of a star!” I said, “Now my brows are laurelled, my hands filled full of their gold, I will sing the starry songs that these earthworms bade withhold. It is time to sing of my star!” for I dreamed that my star still shone, Then I lifted my eyes in my triumph. Night! night! and my star was gone. VII. THE PRODIGAL SON. Come home, come home, for your eyes are sore With the glare of the noonday sun, And nothing looks as it did before, And the best of the day is done. You have played your match, and ridden your race, You have fought in your fight—and lost; And life has set its claws in your face, And you know what the scratches cost. Out there the world is cruel and loud, It strikes at the beaten man; Come out of the press of the stranger crowd To the place where your life began. The best robe lies in the cedar chest, And your father's ring is here; You have known the worst, come home to the best— You will pay for it, never fear! In every kiss of your sister's mouth, In each tear from your mother's eyes, You will pay the price of the days in the South Where the far-off country lies. DESPAIR. Smile on me, mouth of red—so much too red, Shine on me, eyes which darkened lashes shade, Turn, turn my way, oh glorious golden head, My soul is lost, then let the price be paid! Amid rich flowers your rosy lamplight gleams, Amid rich hangings pass your scented hours, And woods and fields are green but in my dreams, And only in my dreams grow meadow-flowers. I have forgotten everything but you— The apple orchard where the whitethroat sings, The quiet fields, the moonlight, and the dew, The virgin's bower that in wet hedgerow clings. I have forgotten how the cool grass waves Where clean winds blow, and where good women pray For happy, honest men, safe in their graves; And—oh, my God! I would I were as they! THE TEMPTATION. You bring your love too late, dear, I have no love to buy it, I spent my love on worthless toys, at fairs you do not know; I am a bankrupt trader—dear eyes, do not deny it, I could have bought your love, dear, but that was long ago. My soul has left me widowed, my heart has made me orphan; Leave me—all good things, dear, have left me—leave me too! For here is ice no tears of yours, no smiles of yours can soften: Leave me, leave me, leave me, I have no love for you! I have no flowers to give you, they grow not in my garden; I have no songs to sing you, my songs have all been sung; I have no hope of heaven, no faith in any pardon, I might have loved you once, dear, when I was good and young. I will not steal, nor cheat you; take back the heart you lent me. O God, whom I have outraged, now teach me how to pray, That love come never again so near me to torment me, Lest I be found less faithful than, by Thy grace, to-day. SECOND NATURE. When I was young how fair the skies, Such folly of cloud, such blue depths wise, Such dews of morn, such calms of eve, So many the lure and the reprieve— Life seemed a toy to break and mend And make a charm of in the end. Then slowly all the dew dried up And only dust lay in the cup; And since, to slake his thirst, man must, I sought a cup that had no dust, And found it at the Goat and Vine— Mingled of brandy, beer and wine. The goat-cup, straight, drew down the skies And lit them in lunatick wise: What had been rose went scarlet red, And the pearl tints grew like the dead. And the fresh primrose of the morn Was the wet red of rain-spoiled corn. Now, with a head that aches and nods I hold weak hands out to the gods; And oh! forgiving gods and kind, They give me healing to my mind, And show me once again the lawn Green and clear-gemmed with dews of dawn. O gods, who look down from above Upon our tangle of lust and love, And, in your purity, perceive The worth of what our follies leave: Give us but this, and sink the rest— To know that dew and dawn are best. VIII. THE OLD DISPENSATION. O Thou, who, high in heaven, To man hast given This clouded earthly life All storm and strife, Blasted with ice and fire, Love and desire, Filled with dead faith, and love That change is master of— O Thou, who mightest have given To all Thy heaven, But who, instead, didst give This life we live— Who feedest with blood and tears The hungry years— I make one prayer to Thee, O Great God! grant it me. Some day when summer shows Her leaf, her rose, God, let Thy sinner lie Under Thy sky, And feel Thy sun's large grace Upon his face; Then grant him this, that he May not believe in Thee! IX. AFTER DEATH. If we must part, this parting is the best: How would you bear to lay Your head on some warm pillow far away— Your head, so used to lying on my breast? But now your pillow is cold; Your hands have flowers, and not my hands, to hold; Upon our bed the worn bride-linen lies. I have put the death-money upon your eyes, So that you should not wake up in the night. I have bound your face with white; I have washed you, yes, with water and not with tears,— Those arms wherein I have slept so many years, Those feet that hastened when they came to me, And all your body that belonged to me. I have smoothed your dear dull hair, And there is nothing left to say for you And nothing left to fear or pray for you; And I have got the rest of life to bear: Thank God it is you, not I, who are lying there. If I had died And you had stood beside This still white bed Where the white, scented, horrible flowers are spread,— I know the thing it is, And I thank God that He has spared you this. If one must bear it, thank God it was I Who had to live and bear to see you die, Who have to live, and bear to see you dead. You will have nothing of it all to bear: You will not even know that in your bed You lie alone. You will not miss my head Beside you on the pillow: you will rest So soft in the grave you will not miss my breast. But I—but I—Your pillow and your place— And only the darkness laid against my face, And only my anguish pressed against my side— Thank God, thank God, that it was you who died! CHLOE. Night wind sighing through the poplar leaves, Trembling of the aspen, shivering of the willow, Every leafy voice of all the night-time grieves, Mourning, weeping over Chloe's pillow. Chloe, fresher than the breeze of dawn, Fairer than the larches in their young spring glory, Brighter than the glow-worms on the dewy lawn, Hear the dirge the green trees sing to end your story:— “Chloe lived and Chloe loved: she brought new gladness, Hope and life and all things good to all who met her; Only, dying, wept to know the lifelong sadness Willed, against her will, to those who can't forget her.” INVOCATION. Come to-night in a dream to-night, Come as you used to do, Come in the gown, in the gown of white, Come in the ribbon of blue; Come in the virgin's colours you wear, Come through the dark and the dew, Come with the scent of the night in your hair, Come as you used to do. Blue and white of your eyes and your face, White of your gown and blue, Will you not come from the happy place, Come as you used to do? Tears so many, so many tears Where there were once so few— Can they not wash the gray of the years From the white of your gown and blue? THE LAST BETRAYAL. And I shall lie alone at last, Clear of the stream that ran so fast, And feel the flower roots in my hair, And in my hands the roots of trees; Myself wrapt in the ungrudging peace That leaves no pain uncovered anywhere. What—this hope left? this way not barred? This last best treasure without guard? This heaven free—no prayers to pay? Fool—are the Rulers of men asleep? Thou knowest what tears They bade thee weep, But, when peace comes, 'tis thou wilt sleep, not They. TRUE LOVE AND NEW LOVE. Over the meadow and down the lane To the gate by the twisted thorn: Your feet should know each turn of the way You trod so many many a day, Before the old love was put out of its pain, Before the new love was born. Kiss her, hold her and fold her close, Tell her the old true tale: You ought to know each turn of the phrase,— You learned them all in the poor old days Before the birth of the new red rose, Before the old rose grew pale. And do not fear I shall creep to-night To make a third at your tryst: My ghost, if it walked, would only wait To scare the others away from the gate Where you teach your new love the old delight, With the lips that your old love kissed. DEATH. Never again: No child shall stir the inmost heart of her And teach her heaven by that first faint stir; No little lips shall lie against her breast Save the cold lips that now lie there at rest; No little voice shall rouse her from her sleep And bid her wake to pain: Her sleep is calm and deep, Call not! refrain. Close in her arm As though even death drew back before the face Of Motherhood in this white stilly place, The gathered bud lies waxen white and cold, As ever a flower your winter gardens hold. She bore the pain, she never wore the crown, She worked the bitter charm, But all she won thereby is here laid down Renounced—for good or harm. Dream? Feed your soul With dreams, while we must starve our hearts on clay, Dream of a glorious white-winged sun-crowned day When you shall see her once more face to face Beside Christ's Mother in the blessed place! But while you dream, they carry her from here, The black bells toll and toll. Oh God! if only she cannot see or hear, Not hear those ghoul-like bells that crowd so near, Not see that cold clay hole. A PARTING. I will not wake you, dear; no tears shall creep To chill the still bed where you lie asleep; No cry, no word, shall break the sanctity Of the great silence where God lets you lie. I will not tease your grave with flower or stone; You are tired, my heart; you shall be left alone. And even the kisses that my lips must lay Upon the mould of the triumphant clay Shall be so soft—like those a mother lays Upon her sleeping baby's little face— You will not feel my kisses, will not hear; You are tired: sleep on, I will not wake you, dear! But when the good day comes, you will hear me cry, “Ah, make a little place where I can lie!” And half awakened, you will feel me creep Into the folds of your familiar sleep, And draw them round us, with a tender moan, “How could you let me sleep so long alone?”</field>
