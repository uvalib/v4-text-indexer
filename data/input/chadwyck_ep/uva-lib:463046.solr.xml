      <field name="fulltext">To the right honourable my most assured freend, sir Christopher Hatton Knight vize chamberlaine to the Queenes Maiestie, and one of her highnesse priuie Counsaill: Thomas Churchyarde wisheth as greate good Fortune and worldly felicitie, as he desireth heauenlie blessyng.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Churchyardes Choise. A pitefull complaint, in maner of a Tragedie, of Seignior Anthonio dell Dondaldoes wife, somtyme in the duke of Florences Courte: Translated out of Italian prose, and putte into Englishe verse. You wiues that wishe, to liue with worldes renowne, And wisely waie, the worthe of precious fame, Come heare the voyce, that giues a wofull sowne. Come heare her tale, that dare not shewe her name, Come Countrey youth, come noble courtly Dame. And marke my woords, whose woorks in wondryng daies, With double blotte, redounds to my dispraies. From tender yeres, till twentie twoo were paste, I nourisht was, at pompe and pleasures papps, But who can tell, how long our ioye shall laste, For greatest calmes, comes ofte to Thonder clapps, And sweetest hopes, doe chaunge to sowrest happs. O tickle tyme, that wanders swift as winde: With heare before, and bare and balde behinde. No gripe nor hande, can take sure holde on thee, Thou flittst so faste, and leaues the worlde at worst, Looke what tyme bryngs, tyme takes awaie you see, Good tyme is blest, badd tyme wee holde accorst. Tyme hurtes them oft, that tyme did helpe at forst, Looke what we haue, when youth is moste in prime: That shall wee want, in age by course of tyme. My freashe delites, doe fall and fade like flowre, The blossomes gaie, from beauties budds are gone, Our state of life, doeth alter euery howre, As pleasures passe, come sorowes pasyng on, The worlde it self, is like a rowlyng stone. And on suche wheeles, our tomblyng happs doe ronne: Thei slide as swifte, as shadowe in the Sonne. Whiles carelesse witte, doeth carry youth about, (To sportes and plaies, that doeth from pastyme ries) The merrie mynde, is voyde of feare and doubt, And all the powres, are glad to please the eyes, But when wilde hedde, or wanton waxeth wise, The weightie thoughtes, that deepe foresight retains, Bryngs troubled sleepes, and breakes the quiet brains. In childishe daies, I made no counte of chaunce, When freends tooke care, to matche me to their will, So hopyng long, good happ would me aduaunce, I kept me free, from wedlocks bondage still, But parents wise, that had good worldly skill. With open checks, rebukt the causes cheef: The more thei sturde, the greater grewe my greef. As when a sore, is rubbde and handled harde, The lesse it heales, because ye touche it neere: O fathers graue, if that you tooke regarde, How that with checks, you vse your children deere: (Or in your moodes, you would some reason heere) Thei should bee ioynde, where thei greate ioye should haue, And you of them, enioye the thyng you craue. But wilfull men (that wealth maie wrest awrie) Will force poore babes, to marrie or to morne, What father will, the child maie not denie, He hurts his shins, against the pricke shall sporne, When matche is made, it is paste tyme to torne. When sillie Lambe, is to the slaughter ledde: The Butchar braggs, the simple Sheepe is dedde. And yet in deede, twere better childern smarte, (And matche in tyme, as cause and matter moues) Then childrens choyse, should breake the fathers harte, Or breede debate, as wilfull marrage proues. Short is the ioye, of them that longest loues, When want comes on, and woe beginnes to wryng: For lacke is thrall, and slaue to euery thyng. Loue is not now, as loue hath been of old, (A game some babe, to dandle on the knee) Loue cares for nought, but lande and baggs of gold, That keepes bothe man, and horse in stable free, Thei haue no witte, that other louers bee, Wealthe maister is, and porter of the gate: That lettes in loue, when want shall come to late. Well as it was, my freends could doe no good, My Fortune bore, the swaie and ruled all, And I full long, on will and freedome stoode, Till fleshe and blood, must needes to fancie fall. And then though happe, and worldly wealth was small, I lighted where, I likte and loued well: And where I voude, for terme of life to dwell. My choise was likte, for many giftes of grace, He had, though wealth, somtyme was not at will: And for his sake, in many a noble place, I welcome was, and purchast fauour still. My candell blasde, like torche on toppe of hill, And for content, of minde where loue doeth reste: Myne owne poore choise, might passe emong the beste. Long liu'de we thus, at home and eke abroad, When kindred cleane, in deede forsooke vs bothe, What burthen fell, I helpt to beare the loade, And glad in worlde, to taste how Fortune gothe. The minde I had, to God and sacred othe, Made me refuse, no trauaill for his sake: Whom of free will, I choose to bee my make. The seas wee sailde, the lande wee rode about, The Court wee sawe, the Toune wee dwelt long in, The feeldes we walkt, the gardains gaie throughout, Wee went vnto, where many a feast hath bin. Wee could not sincke, for happe helde vp the chin, He prosperde well, and looke what God had sent: With louyng wife, at home the same he spent. He tooke greate paines, to come by that he had, And trauailde sore, through many a forraine soile: To bryng that home, that makes the housholde glad, And keepe the wife, and housholde folke from foile. And I tooke care, that nothyng went to spoile, And looke in deede, what thyngs that I did lacke: Was seen in face, or founde vpon my backe. The worlde might see, I went in garmentes good, Though small I brought, to hym as I confesse: I spent hym muche, and at greate charge he stoode, Whiche bryngs strong harts, somtyme to greate distresse. But neuer that, might make his loue the lesse, For looke how he, his likyng first beganne: In fine for trothe, he proude the self same manne. I could not sleepe, but where in bedde he laie, I could not eate, but where he satte at boorde, I could not laugh, when likyng was awaie, I silent satte, gaue he but halfe a woorde. Ill newes of hym, strake me with mortall sworde, His minde and myne, did drawe so in one yoke: The self same fitts, he felt where of I spoke. Full seuen yeres, this constant course wee kept, Though oftentymes, there happened housholde iarrs, And trattlyng tales, that in betweene vs crept, Made many wounds, where yet remaines the skarrs: Yet alwaies peace, tooke vp our braulyng warrs, And wee did seeke, to salue eche others sore: And passe old greefes, and thinke thereon no more. Sweete is that peace, that patcheth vp greate harmes, Sharpe is the warre, that teares a house in twaine: Wo worthe those words, that brings in braules by swarms Darke be those cloudes, that alwaies threatens raine. Curste bee the cause, that breedeth woe and paine, And dampde in hell, those subtell spirits shalbe: That councell gaue, to parte my choise from me. Well as our chaunce, together was to ioyne, And dwell long while, as here in breef you harde: So happe came on, (through hope of wealth or coyne) And drewe my choise, where he might bee prefarde. To warrs, and I, that had a greate regarde, To hym that tyme, when I his mynde did knowe: Gaue my consent, that he to warrs should goe. With sighes and sobbs, and bitter tears emong, Wee parted tho, with promes suerly paste: That one should here, from other ere twere long, And sadly soe, wee seured at the laste. His goods, his gold, his freends bothe firme and faste, He lefte me then to comfort me with all: But nere a child, as Fortune so did fall. He paste the seases, and sent me tokens still, And money suche, as might supplie my neede: And for to shewe, his faithe and greate good will, Long letters large, he made that I might reede. Of promes paste, and to come home in deede, But to what ende, should serue this businensse greate: My minde was toernd, warme loue had loste his heate. A newe fine man, bothe yong and apt for chaunge, I chose, and cleane, forgat my former ioye: And in a while, I was become so straunge, As hagard Hauke, that takes in hedde a toye. And flees from Lure, and waxeth nice and coye, My wedlocke now, not hearyng of these newes: Made no haste home, till I was oer the shewes. Yet knacks I wrought, to blear my housbandes eyes, I made a brute, be blowne that I was dedde: When that he heard, he did his life dispies, And so forsooke, sleepe, reste, and taste of bread, He rent his hear, he sadly shooke his head, He walkt the woods, and shunned all repaire: As one would be, deuourd with foulls of thaire. He daiely bledd, when little foode he tooke, He would not come, where women were in place: And he so leane, and like a ghost did looke, That Death it self, was seen amid his face. A noble Erle, as he behelde this cace, Brake with the man, that thus tormented was, And so in sports, the troubled tyme did passe. But Ague fitts, and sicknesse followde on, That in poore plite, came home my housbande thoe: Not leane in purse, but bare and neere the boen, The bodie weake, was worne with warre and woe. And yet full sounde, as all the worlde might knowe, His limmes I sawe, but I so nice did waxe: There was no flame, of fire might come to flaxe. For I could weepe, and quenche by connyng arte, The hottest loue, that euer housbande bore: And so twoo yeres, I plaied a Foxes parte, Whiche ere I dye, I maie repent full sore. My housbandes bedde, I shond, and furthermore, I fainde I had, a sicknesse let it goe: I neuer mynde, that follie forthe to showe. A finer tricke, to compasse that I sought, I plaied through sleight, and castyng figures trim: To my good man, a bastard girle I brought, And from my freend, presented her to hym. He sawe thereby, the flood ronne oer the brim, Yet kept it close, and saied nothyng at all: Till out by chaunce, might further matter fall. And alwaies would, my housbande tell me plaine, I did hym wrong, to keepe me from his bedde: But I could vse, hym in a pleasaunt vaine, And make hym soone, forget that he had sedde. My dore was lockt, how ere I laied my hedde, My maids and I, kept solempne cheare a lone: How euer plaine, poore housbande made his mone. Twoo yeres this wise, I shifted Cardes full cleane, Till housbande spied, a letter of my hande: Whereby he founde, what follie I did meane, But I was bent, against my deede to stande. So faest hym doune, and swore when all was scande, It was not myne, but as he soundly slept: To his bedds side, my maied and I wee stept. And heaude hym vp, and so from bolster than, Wee tooke his purse, wherein the letter laye: When that wee had, wee lefte the sillie man, As saffe as he, that sleepes in cocke of haie: Well, when he lookt, in purse the other daie, And founde my fraude, and falshed as it was: Out of the dore, in furie did he passe. Yet came againe, that night and so fell sicke, (The cause whereof, sone after you shall heer) Full long he laie, and toucht so neere the quicke, That he was like, to bye that sicknesse deer. But when on foote, he stept and all was cleer, He badde farewell, false wise God sende thee grace: Thy wicked waies, makes housbande giue thee place. I sawe how worlde, would wonder on this acte, And streight newe tales, on housbande gan I raise: With forged lyes, and railyng reasons rackt, That still should sounde, vnto his moste dispraise. I fainde one while, he vsed wanton waies, With euery maied, that he might touche or see: And then he was, to sicke a soule for me. Then poore he was, I saied to cloke my pride, When this serude not, I swore the man was madd, And in his rage, would beate me backe and side, So euery daie, a newe deuice I hadd. To make the worlde, beleeue he was to badd, And at the length, when all I had was sold: My maied and I, goe trie the worlde we wold. So shuttyng dore, and trussyng vp my packe, I flang from home, not biddyng freends farewell: But I had not, no sooner tournde my backe, But housbande heard, how all this matter fell. And yet a lone, a while he let me dwell, Till that he sawe, I was so farre paste shame: I caerd not what, became of honest name. In deede the house, where I my residence made, With lustie ladds, was haunted euery owre: And I had those, that well could tosse the blade, To take my parte, if housbande gan to lowre. His freends were weake, and I with strongest powre, Beganne to bragge, and threaten hym full sore: And had preparde, a bloudie bande therefore. I sought to bryng, my brethren to this braull, But thei were wise, and would no quarrell take: And puttyng of, the harms that might befall, Thei wisely wrought, a freendly peace to make. But euer I, good councell did forsake, And thought to make, my housbande hide his hedde: Or practise still, till he poore man were dedde. Yet in a moode, when least I lookt therefore, He came and tolde, me all was muche amis: Where at I cried, alas and loude I rore, For neighbours helpe, who quickly hearyng this. Came thrustyng in as ofte the maner is, How now good folke, ? he with bended brow: Twene man and wife, dare you be sticklars now. No in good faithe, ? thei and so retierd, But still I lookt, for other succour there: And for that thyng, that housbande then desierd, I tooke no care, I ment a further feare. To bryng hym in, yet maied in giuyng eare, To honest woords, fell doune on knees at laste: And pardon craude, for priuie knaurie paste. My housbande then, forgaue her and tooke leaue, In hope my minde, would gentill waxe thereby: But I that ment my housbande to deceaue, In better place, beganne a greater crie. Where women were, that markt my weepyng eye, And thought in deede, I had been handled ill: So staied me there, perforce emong them still. My housbande swore, I should receiue no harme, And home againe, I should be saffely brought: But I had taught, the women suche a charme, Thei would not then, depart from me for nought. That could be saied, thus he like ware was wrought, And tempred so, that home without his wife: He went awaie, the more my shamelesse life. When shamefaste lookes, forsooke my modest face, I waxt so bolde, I blusht no more then blocke: Then clapt on robes, of gaie vainglories grace, With collours faire, to paint a foule blacke stocke. Yet calde I was, a Hen for eche good Cocke, A morsell sweete, a whetstone fine forsothe: To sette on edge, on euery daintie tothe. I carde not how, my housbande murthred were, By Magicks force, or any Deulishe arte: I shonde his sight, and presence eurie where, As one that lodgde, disdaine in hatefull harte. And still I plaied, full many a silthie parte, To rid hym hence, and take awaie his life: Who God preserude, to plague a paltryng wife. And for to hide, those brainsicke prancks of mine, I had a knacke, to breake the marrage bande: And so a dragme, or draught of poison fine, I did deuise, to happ in housbands hande. And as that cuppe, on tables ende did stande, With feruent thirst, he came and so it raught, And in that heate, dranke of the mortall draught. When giltie harte, should make my face to blushe, I braude it out, in silks and Ueluetts gaie: And caerd not what, worlde saied of me a rushe, For I tooke tyme, ere tyme would weare awaie. (At gracelesse games, and many a shamelesse plaie) And sowyng seeds, that Nettle flowers brought forthe: I reapt but weeds, or thistles nothyng worthe. I ruffled long, when housbande barely went, And faecst hym out, in streate or ciuill toune: My freends did force, the man to stande content, It was no boote, to striue or sweare me doune. For I had made, the worlde on hym to froune, And raisde a brute, that he was bedlem madd: Thus loe of hym, the conquest still I hadd. My haunt was suche, emong the noblest sort, That I was calde, a sober Sibill sage: And worthie witts, would builde on my report, For I knewe how, to flatter eurie age. And alwaies wrought, to make my housbande rage, Whereby his life, in hazard, hard might fall: And I the while, ronne cleane awaie with ball. I loued not one, but lusted after all, The puddell foule, was fittest for a gigge: The Fountaine faire, did drinke like bitter gall, In filthie mudde, I wallowde like a pigge. About the streats, was gaddyng gentill rigge, With cloes tuckt vp, to sette badd ware to sale: For youth good stuffe, and for old age a stale. A louyng looke, could make a Gudgeon bite, A fine dugard, could fetche in scolles of fishe: A cunnyng knacke, could stirre vp cold delite, A glittryng girle, could feede a wantons wishe. And who doeth not, desire a daintie dishe, Whose sugred taste, breeds secret eger moode: That faine would feede, and finds moste fearfull foode. I could in streate, besturre and stretche my limmes, As though some sprite, were vnder outward showe: Who angleth not, for fishe that smothly swimmes, At pleasant marke, who doeth not bende the bowe. Small shaftes are shotte, at many a carraine Crowe, Then if faire birdes, doe happ to come in waie: Blame not the Hauke, that maks of foule a praie. Not beautie here, I claime by this my talke, For browne and blacke, I was God blesse the marke: Who calls me faire, doeth scarce knowe cheese fr? chalke, For I was formde, when Winters nights were darke. And Natures woorks, tooke light at little sparke, For kinde in scorne, had made a mould of Iette: That shone like cole, wherein my face was sette. Three yeres I straied, like waffe that waxeth wilde, Twoo more at least, I laie from housbands bedd: And all this while, I vsde hym like a childe, For at no tyme, I neither wrate nor sedd. Ne sent to hym, suche toyes I had in hedd, That stomacke stiffe, thought not to stoupe a whit: For stubborne Colt, in teeth had got the bit. He let me runne, oer hedge, oer hill and dale, And would not plucke, the raines of bridell backe: I could tell why, but thereby hangs a tale, Would make me blushe, and shewe of grace greate lacke. I had my will, whiles all thyng went to wracke, What needs more wordes, I ranne so rude a race: I neuer thought, againe to turne my face. What sleight scapes free, from subtell searchyng hedde, What wit works not, to serue leawde womens wiells: What practise flies, the foile of stained bedde, What is not wonne, with woords or worldly giells. What will not yeeld, and faune where Fortune smiells, What tyme is loste, to gaine that women craue: And all proceeds, from waiward will we haue. If that wee loue, the furie lasts not long, If once wee hate, our malice hath no ende: If that wee minde, to offer housbande wrong, Wee want no witte, the quarrell to defende. Our stubborne harte, hath rather breake then bende, And custome hath, emong vs made suche lawse: That all our sexe, will take one part and cause. And where the floud, and streame of strife doeth ronne, In comes the Tide, of daiely troubles greate: Yea where a storme, or braule is once begonne, All bitter blasts, repairs and breathes out heate. The eyes will stare, the face will froune and sweate, The tong must clapp, the hedde will shake and nodd: And harte with in, hath cleane forgotten God. Freends must be wrought, with blades to bande it out, Fose must be whippt, and scourged in their kinde: Worlde shalbe toste, and tourned rounde about, Still to maintaine, the mischeef of the minde. Tale bearars then, shall lye within the winde, To bryng badde newes, and set the house a fier: That flaemd before, with sparks of spietts desire. My practise straunge, can all these plaeggs vnfolde, That better were, lappt vp in silence here: To late to call, againe that tong hath tolde, The wise should sell, their words and worship deere. But since in worlde, my self I can not cleere, I will goe through, this heauie tale of myne: That worlde maie well, at wicked waies repine. Long after this, he heard that I laye sicke, And then from Court, he coms with right greate speede: To comfort me, that was bothe sounde and quicke, To plaie the Foxe, or knaue againe for neede. But though that tyme, I would not bee agreede, I tooke his wine, and sent hym so awaie: With scorne enough, in signe of partyng daie. For since that tyme, he neuer sawe my face, Nor had no mynde, to come where was my haunt: And since that storme, I had so little grace: In euerie soile, I make my boste and vaunte, I conquerd hym, and so I doe you graunte. For three yeers more, I haue doen what I please: And livde at large, in luste and lordlie ease. And these fiue yeres, I haue doen what I can, By tong and arte, and figuers that I caste: And curie waie, to shame my plaine good man, Whiche shame I feare, will sure be myne at laste. I am so learnd, I can plaie louse and faste, My skill is suche, in Planetts hye and loe: I ruell the Skies, and Heauens where I goe. Good Fortunes sure, some saie that I can tell, And many thyngs, by figures I vnfolde: I saie no more, but wishe that all were well, For he that doeth, this wicked worlde beholde. Whose Godhed seeth, into this masie molde, Knowes well how ofte, I tread my shue a wrie: And in what plite, my synfull soule doeth lye. And if this God, regard with angrie cheere, The vice on yearth, that vainly we committe: And straitly looke, vnto my doyngs heere, And like a Iudge, in tremblyng conscience sitte. I am condempd, there serus ne force nor witte, Out is my Lampe, the oile hath loste his light: And my faire daie, is tornd to foule blacke night. The searchyng hedds, that sifts my maners throwe, Will shrinke a side, when I drawe neere their vewe: The wievly daems, that seeth my blotted browe, In my behalfe, will blushe and chaunge their hewe. The gentill harts, that others harms doeth rewe, Will muche lament, my life so leawdly ronne: And cleane vntwiste, the threeds good name hath sponne. The baseste dame (whose faults are borne in breste) Will scorne to heare, my follie blasde abrode: The fromppyng flocke, at me wilt make a ieste, The spitfull swarme, will poult and swell like Tode. My giltie mynde, that bears moste heauie lode, Will sinke doune right, when worlde shall talke of grace: And shame her self, will slubber all my face. The sober sorte, that setts by noble brute, Will shake their hedds, as thei my boldnesse spie: The clappyng tongs, will neuer sure be mute, Shreawd people all, will shewe a lowryng eye. But still I feare, the Lorde that sitts on hye, Will looke more straunge, on me so late disgraste: Then all the worlde, that here beneath are plaste. The Churche wherein, bothe faithe and hande I gaue, Shall witnesse beare, of breache of promes due: The spousall bedde, and marrage daie so braue, Shall make me cald, forsworne and moste vntrue: The holie booke, the old lawe and the newe, Against my soule, shall sure sharpe sentenec giue, In other worlde, where sprtte desiers to liue. Let matrons chaste, and modest wiues eche one, That falshed haets, and lou's their trothe to keepe: In furie come, and flyng at me a stone, And let no wight, my death bewaile nor weepe. Let daies vnrest, and dreadfull dreams in sleepe, Pursue me still, and bryng me to my graue: Since God and man, I so offended haue. The stepps I tread, shall tell me my offence, The feelds I walke, shall bryng my fault to minde: The harms I did, in worlde shall haste me hence, The wealthe I wishe, shall waste and weare with winde. The fame I seeke, shall flyng me farre behinde, And all good things, that vertues wiues enioye: At my moste neede, shall tourne to myne anoye. The wise that waies, my wiells in ballance right, Shall see my witte, want weight and be but bace, The foole hymself, shall finde my iudgement light, In makyng choise, to chopp and chaunge my cace. The poore shall point, at me in eurie place, The riche and those, that swaie and rule doeth beare: With curbe of Lawe, shall bryng leawde life in feare. The freends I had, shall frowne and shunne my sight, The foes I haue, shall followe me with shame: The neighbour loue, that pleasd me daie and night, Shall now drawe backe, and looke on losse of name. The merrie mate, and homely countrey dame, And all the toune, and soile where I was borne: In Parishe Churche, shall laugh my life to scorne. The bande once broke, that God hymself hath bleste, Bryngs worldly woe, and cursses in by swarmes: The marrage marde, that God made for mans reste, Turns vpside doune, from happie helpe to harmes. The Bridall bedde, defield with lothsome charmes, Breeds wicked smoke, and smothryng sclanders blase: On whose foule fume, a worlde of people gase. The knotte of loue, vnknitt by hatefull cause, Caulls greeffs to count, and cries to clouds for aied: The leuwd contempt, and breache of sacred lawes, Maeks eurie howre, offendour sore afraied. The fickle faithe, that is with skurges paied, Bidds falshed flie, the plague that is preparde: For those who looks, to life with small regarde. No rofflyng troupe, that swashe and swill vp wine, Can ward the blowes, that wrathe of God sends doune: No cunnyng knacks, nor knackyng fetches fine, Can conquer trothe, and thrust hym out of toune. No treasons traine, can take waie true renoune, No cloud can cloke, the crafte that all men findes: No salue but grace, can heale infected mindes. My hollowe harte, hath loste the hope I had, What dropps in now, doeth doubt and daunger bryng: In housbands ears, I spake that made me glad, With newfounde freends, I talke that mak's me wryng. The first good will, from vertuous loue did spryng, The laste delite, and all that since fell out: Began on luste, and needs must ende in doubt. Now open streats, by Oule flight must I walke, And secret nouks, and shifts must shadowe sleight: Except I care, not what the worlde doeth talke, And minde to frame, a crooked matter streight. And then though pride, holds hedde a wonders height, Shame plucks doune harte, and mak's me blushe at laste: But well awaie, that signe of grace is paste. Though in the teeth, I haue the bridell gote, And that I run, beyond my riders reache: I dare not syng, in quere to hye a note, For feare of checke, and tuter doe me teache. I plaie boe peepe, least people me appeache, I seem a sainct, when deulishe thyngs I meane: Yet muche adoe, I haue to carrie cleane. O wretched change, that bryngs repentaunce ofte, O bitter sweete, whose taste deceiues vs all: O poisoned luste, that puff's vp pride a lofte, O graclesse game, full farest with sugred gall. O trippyng trust, that swiftly giu's a fall, O spitfull sport, that spends thy youth in shame: And bryngs thine age, in horrour and deffame. O greedie will, that gaines but greef of minde, O gnawyng worme, that fretts the conscience still: O wicked arte, that striks the senses blinde, O madde deuice, that tourns from good to ill. O leawd desire, more hotte then Eathna hill, O beasily blisse, begun on balde consaite: And doeth bewitche, them all that bites the baite. O paultryng plaie, and piuishe pastyme vaine, O slidyng ioye, that sincks where suertie swims: O perlous toye, and pleasure mixt with paine, O Peacocke proude, that still fonde feathers trims. O lustie bloud, naye wanton lothsome lims, That stoups to filthe, and costly carrein gaie: That giu's badd gold, and stealls good name awaie. My merrie maetts, and minsyng minions fine, Speaks faire a while, to winne their leawd desire: But wilely worlde, can let me starue and pine, And for reward, can giue a floute or flire. So lead me on; and leaue me in the mire, And blabb all out, that hath been closly wrought: O pranks of youth, O painted thyng of nought. O puddell foule, that seems at first full faire, O cause of care, and source of sorrowe sowre: O deadly hope, and grounde of deepe despaire, O pleasaunt weede, and stinckyng rotten flowre. O rauenyng Wolues, that doeth poore wiues deuoure, O smiling theeues, that robbs the chastest harte: O traiterous tongs, that can plaie Iudas parte. You laied your trains, as Foulars laies his nette, You bosome Snak's, your styng hath me vndoen: By louyng you, at length what shall I gette, When you me lothe, where shall the caste of ron. Wo worth that wight, that woyng first begon, Curste be the craft; that cause th clamours ryes: And vengance fall, vpon your staryng eyes. A plague consume, your songs and suttell suets, A wildfire catche, your combrous knauishe brains: A murrein take, your foule vntymely fruets, A cancker eate, your hands and azure vains. The Haggs of hell, reward you for your pains, Bothe pen and ynke, and all that helpe desire: (And you your selues) I wishe in flamyng fire. Fie on your scroulls, and Pistells full of lyes, An Oten strawe, for all your stately stiells: Your frisled hear, and naughtie newfounde gies, Your lordly looks, your simpryng shamlesse smiells. Your wanton talke, and priuie winckyng wiells, I here bequeath, to Sathan and his crue: Good fellows fitte, for suche false ladds as you. You are the frothe, and skum of worlds delite, The dallyng whelps, that can with feathers plaie: Of mischefs all, the marke, the butte, and white, The iollie Frie, that follows flood eche waie. The gallant flocke, the stately starrs of daie, The busie Bees, that can no Home make: But spoilars of, eche fruit and flowre ye take. The waityng doggs, that bite before thei barke, The couchyng currs, that snatche at eurie flie: The figboies fine, that Iuggels in the darke, The cunnyng crue, that at receit can lie. The sookyng sponge, that draws faire fountains drie, The greedie hounds, that follows eurie game: The blott and staine, of eche good womans name. A robe or ryng, or triflyng token bare, You giue for that, you neuer can restore: Then are you gone, you haue your wished fare, In straunger streams, you loue to stere your Ore. If honest wiu's, but knewe your prancks before, Thei would as sone, see of your suttell hedds: As by your drifts, goe staine their housbands bedds. In marrage house, is freendly fastnesse found, Though fare be meane, content fills vp the dishe: In bordell bowre, sweete banketts are vnsound, Though dainties there, wee haue at will and wishe. At home wee take, in worth cold fleshe or fishe, For warme good will, doeth season so the chere: That with small coste, wee banket all the yere. A broad wee sit, as though wee were a fearde, And scarce dare feede, or talke for taunts and nipps: At home wee rule, in spite of housbands bearde, And plaie the Cooke, and so maie licke our lipps. A broad for nought, our tong is taine in tripps, And then greate harte, can neither drinke nor eate: Thus dere is bought, a broad our borrowde meate. Looke what is saied, an home in clothe is lappt, There speeche is free, and honest sports wee vse: O well a waie, that this misfortune happt, And that I did, my housbande so abuse. That I haue brought, my self into a muse, Loste home thereby, loste God and good mens praies: And now must run, a gaddyng all my daies. A plague moste fitte, for them that use to change, A scourge wherein, the wrathe of God is seene: A staffe of strife, for pilgrime nothyng strange, A bleedyng wounde, that mak's my sorrowe greene. A sore rebuke, for witts that ouer weene, A heauie crosse, and sent me for the noens: To breake my will, and yet to bruse no boens. But since my will, did weaue this wofull webbe, That needs must make, a weede for wantons weare: And that my flood, is like to fall to ebbe, By want of will, that ought lowe faile to beare. To punishe soule, that els some other where, Might suffer smart, I vowe in hande to take: A better life, and so false worlde forsake. Awaie proude pompe, and costly garments nice, Come mournyng goune, and clothe the carefull wight: Awaie vaine showes, and open signes of vice, Come vertue now, and giue my Lampe more light. Come Sommers daie, adue darcke Winters night, I loue to liue, and looke about me farre: When wound is heald, tyme maie amende the scarre. Awaie yong Frie, that giu's leawd councell nowe, Awaie old trotts, that setts yong fleshe to sale: Awaie foule slutts, whose filth did blot my browe, Awaie trim-toings, that near told honest tale. Awaie bold beasts, whose brabble bred my bale, Awaie rude Wasps, you stong me through the brest: Goe hide your hedds, and let me liue in reste. Awaie wilde giggs, that bounceth like a topp, Awaie tame louts, that faune like whelps for nought: Awaie light hedds, that lou's to chaunge and chopp, Awaie fine witts, that many mischeu's wrought. Awaie slee Snak's, that my destruction sought, Awaie false shreaws, that neuer none maie trust: But suche leawd girls, as are begilde by lust. Awaie faire speeche, that me bewitcht to long, Awaie foule woorks, that filde my face with blurrs: Come home poore sence, that ledde my fancie wrong, And packe from me, you priuie bityng currs. That sticketh still, together like wilde burrs, And where ye touche, ye bryng awaie the wull: So from fine clothe, pure honest name ye pull. Tis tyme to looke, how good reporte was loste, And prop vp house, that now is nere to fall: A wretched brute, flies through the ayre in poste, A whirlyng winde, maie come and tripp doune all. And though I liste, not come at housbands call, I maie not flie, from God and followe man: That still deuours, like Wolfe what sheepe he can. The sweetest wine, at length wlll waxe full sowre, It prou's sharpe sauce, that once had sugred taste: Fonde fancies freaks, will fade as faste as flowre, And wantons loue, with sports will weare and waste. When hard in arm's, newe commers are embraste, Farewell old freend, goe plaie you where you wull: The hauke hath praid, the Haggards gorgs is full. Loue staies not long, it is but one yeers birde, A foolishe fitte, that mak's wilde witts goe madde: A gallant Colte, that ronneth for a girde, A lime rodde fine, to catche a lustie ladde. A youthfull prancke, that mak's age looke full sadde, A merrie mate, so long as money lasts: Good for a flight, then of her bells she casts. Loue tarries not, it is a postyng game, That hath suche haste, it goes wee knowe not where: Now faire and fatte, then crooked leane and lame, Now plaies boe peepe, now fiskyng here and there. Now balde as Coote, now trim with fresled heare, Now gaie and glad, now shreawd and scarce well pleasd: Now sounde as Chicke, now sicke and sone diseasd. With daslyng mutche, loue will be easly tierd, When loue is cloied, the roile at gresse must ronne: When hoofe is whole, the hackney maie be hierd, When corne is solde, the markett cleane is donne. It ends with hate, that was with loue begonne, It maie be loth'd, that long on likyng laie: Luste lacks no wings, when loue will flie a waie. Loue must haue change, to season sweete delite, Lou's mynde will range, like Spaniell in the feelde: Loue lookes like Doue, when she will proue a Kite, Loue seeks to rule, she hath no minde to yeelde. Loue will haue scope, loue is restrained seelde, If loue lacke ought, she showes a lowryng eye: And then for nought, the babe will pule and crie. Loue must be kolld, and kissed round about, Loue must goe gaie, and painted like a poste: Loue must be peecst, and patcht with many a clout, Loue is a sprite, a shadowe or a ghoste. A needlesse charge, that seldome quitts the coste. A practise bought, with many a threede bare purse: A wretched blisse, that I and myne maie curse. It is the skum, and onely drosse of youth, That bryngs bothe soule, and bodie in decaye, A kinde of talke, wherein there is no truth, A Courtyng trade, that doeth muche crafte bewraie. A wilie Foxe, a wanton full of plaie, A sainct to showe, a Deuill God he knose: That me betraied, and made me freedome lose. The Horse ronns farre, that neuer tourns againe, The beaten child, is learnd to feare the rod: The double minde, maie fall to meanyng plaine. Thei maie a mende, that feels the feare of God. The clouds maie cleere, that long hath threatned raine, The tyme ill spent, if reason will redeeme: Calls home wilde witts, from toyes that are extreeme. Youth tak's his course, and follows fancies freaks, Age all reforms, and sore repents tyme paste: The bowe long bent, ye knowe in processe weaks, Hard thyngs at first, maie gentill waxe at laste. Who often faulls, is taught to stande full faste, And fewe there are, but slieds or falls doune right: In youth or age, our iudgements are so light. When witte is bought, (and follie throughly waied,) An vnce of skill, is worthe a pounde of drosse: Till bodie smarte, the minde is neuer staied, Gaine is not likte, till we haue tasted losse. Some saie eche one, is borne to beare his crosse, My heauie faults, now burthens breast so sore: That heare or hence, I must be scourgd therefore. Sweete are those stripps, that breaks ne bone nor lim, (And yet setts sound, the soule and bodie bothe:) Sowre are those ioyes, and worldly braurie trim, That doune to hell, with dampned people gothe. Sweete are sharpe woords, that tells leawd life the trothe, Sowre is sweete sause, that cloyes the stomacke still: Sweete are those nipps, that doeth restraine the will. The pampred horse, that still in stable stands, Will waxe a iade, if spurre ne wande he taest: The wildest Colt, is tam'd by riders hands, And so through bitte, is made well traind and paest, All hedstrong thyngs, are not reformd in haest, But when regard, looks backe where blindnesse went: The perrill paste, bides pompe and Pride repent. Greate is the scope, that greedie will desiers, Small gaine or grace, doeth growe by gaddyng out: With heauie lode, the wearie leggs retiers, And hartfull fraught, of worldly dread and dout. And sure the ground, from whence all vice doeth sprout, Is gaddyng geres, that lovs a broad to gase: Who shame sends home, in greate sadde muse and mase. And when in dores, dame dalliance close is drawne, And noets what blot, she did escape with out: She thinks in streate, she put her name to pawne, Or went abroad, to plaie the bare banckrout. Where wanton eyes, did naught but stare about, Where all a flant, at full like shippe with saile: Fine minions marche, as braue as Pecockes taile. The croked backe, must bolstred be by arte, The taunie skinne, must shine by some trim knacke: The twinklyng looks, for sport must plaie their parte, The perwicks fine, must curle where hear doeth lacke. The swellyng grace, that fills the emptie sacke, And iettyng pace, with limes stretcht out full streight: To patche out pride, are matters of greate weight. Then fie on all, suche trashe and tromprie vile, That setts forthe shaeds, in Sonnie daie to shine: My youth is paste, I can not worlde begile, Men will not looke, for babes in hollowd eyen. A witherd grape, hangs now on rotten vien, From blasted branche, the berrie round is gone: A doskie glasse, is little lookt vpon. Wherefore I vowe, to weare a sorie vaile, To shrowd the face, that feaw or none will like: And get some shell, to holde in hedde like Snaile, For former faults, in conscience so doeth strike. That I doe feare, I shall my self mislike, If shadowes doe, not cloke defects I haue: Or death dispatche, and sende me to my graue. Now note my tale, you dames of gentill blood, Now waile with me, all suche as plaies my parte: Now let my harms, doe harmlesse people good, Now bid all wivs, defie this deulishe arte. For my consaite, is suche a deadly darte, That where I goe, or walke in any place: Me thinks my faults are written in my face. FINIS. A heauie matter of a Englishe gentleman, and a gentlewoman, in maner of a Tragedie: whiche gentlewoman called her freende the wanderyng Prince. The wandryng Prince, whiche ran the restlesse race, Had muche a doe, to trie this froward fate: And I poore man, that doeth supplie his place, In pilgrims porte, maie waile my wofull state. To Gods and men, the storie now I tell, That iudgement haue, to marke my matter well: Bothe lande and seas, as farre as wandrer goes, (And worlde so wide) my sokyng sorrowe knoes. In natiue soile, where long I fostred was, A make I chose, to leade my life with all: From whom at length, I wandryng Prince did pas, For causes greate, that tournd my sweete to gall. Suffice to thinke, some fire did raise the smoke, That made me flie, and shunne from marrage yoke: Some piuishe pranck, some padde laied in the strawe, That forced feers, thus seurall waies to drawe. A wretched happ, betid's betweene them twaine, That parts in haste, where long the loue was bent: An open plague, a pinchyng priuie paine, Is felt and founde, where suche mishapp is sent. The house decaies, the credite cracks with all, And doune full flatte, doeth eche good Fortune fall: And of renowme, the propps and pillars shak's, And babblyng tongs, there on a wonder mak's. Let sleepe some harms, my muse must now awake, To blase the broills, that wandryng life did bryng: Who goes from home, and doeth a iourney take, Full little knowes, where doeth the saddell wryng. Till bityng greefs, bewraies a secret sore, As sone as man, setts foote on forraine shore: A mischeef streight, doeth meete hym full in face, As welcome fitte, for men from forraine place. As straungers here, somtymes haue gazers on, And Crowes with Kietts, doe seldome well agree: So home bred birds, from hence no soner gon, In countrey straunge, full sone oermatched bee. First finesse coms, and fram's some fashon newe, To catche wilde hauks, or cast tame birde in mewe: Then falshed fliers, and plaies the wilie Foxe, With gaddyng foote, that faste is in the stoxe. The traular tasts, more toile then tong can tell, More troublous tyms, than trothe maie well report: Wants heuens blisse, and feeleth more of hell, Then all the souls, that to this worlde resort. The Camell bears, a burthen greate you knowe, The Asse likewise, doeth not vncharged goe: But neither beast, nor nothyng name you maie, Surmounts the pains, of wandryng Prince I saie. My deastnie drewe, my daies to dolefull date, Desire to see, strange realms bred myne vnrest: For where I thought, in suretie saffe I sate, Farre from my freends, I found my self distrest. In daunger oft, and feare of mortall foe, I daiely paste, betweene the stryng and boe: No hazard here, on yearth that men maie finde, But there to me, blinde deastnie had assignde. My life was sought, and freedome loste I long, Compeld to stoupe, where God was scarcly knowne: Denied of right, and forste to suffer wrong, And plainly spoild, of that whiche was my nowne. In hockstars hands, where lawe was made of will, (And hauocks mouthe,) I daiely hapned still: Now drownd in dread, and wishyng greedie graue. Then feard to be, a seruile galley slaue. No helpe from home, was lookt for any waie, All hope was gone, betweene good happe and mee: In these extreams, thus paste I many a daie, Till God had sette, bothe minde and bodie free. And in the ende, ere I did homward drawe, At my nowne will, Ierusalem I sawe: And Sipres too, with diuers kyngdoms more, Whiche stately seats, I had not seen before. A minde I had, of further toile then this, But sondrie letts, in that behalf I founde: And as oft tyms, I did my purpose mis; So loe in fine, I drewe me homeward round. But Fortune wrought, for me suche spite at home, That once againe, a broad I must goe rome: I shapt me thoe, a nerar course to hold, In hope that happe, the haplesse fauour wold. Now sought I how, to serue my countrey well, And fram'd bothe witts, and wealth to that delite: In forraine soile, the wandryng Prince did dwell, From whence oft tyms, to countrey did I write. Yea to the cheef, that here hath rule and charge, To whom I showd, some matters full at large: For whiche I wanne, greate fauour and good will, So long tyme spent, in right good credite still. But Fortune fround, at that good lucke of mine, As she was wont, to doe by course and kinde: That froward dame, ye knowe doeth still repine, At eurie one, that bears a noble minde. A dreadfull Duke, a fearfull prince I saie, Sore matters there, vnto my charge did laie: And clapt me vp, in cruell prison faste, Where long I lookt, for nought but death at laste. Yleuen months, I laie in lothsome sincke, Where some condempd, aboad the diesmoll daie: Some liu'd in lacke, and staru'd for meate and drinke, Some made greate shift, yet could not get awaie: Some were had out, to suffer for offence, Some had small wealth, yet laie at greate expence: And some were rackt, and loste their lims there bye, And none but glad, to please the Iailours eye. The fulsome smells, and sauours out of frame, Weare able sure, to burst a Giants harte: The vsage vile, and other greefs to name, Did farre surmount, the weight of common smarte, The checks, the taunts, and bitter bityng words, Did cutte more sharpe, then bloodie mortall swords: The torments strange, that helhounds shewd vs theare, Was sure muche more, then humain kinde could beare. The worlde abroad, knows not what prisnars feele, The birde on bushe, conceiu's no care of cage: Who sitts a loft, in topp of Fortun's wheele, Full little knowes, the cause of captiu's rage. Well I suckt vp, of this the sweete and sowre, And sought for freends, and so stretcht forth my powre: That out I came, and homward once againe, I paste in peace, and scapt a scouryng plaine. Here found I things, as God hym self did please, My wife in graue, and worlde was altred cleane: Then did I frame, my self to liue at ease, And as I might, to hold a merrie meane. Content with cares, that tyme had ouer blowne, Full bent to dwell, and reste vpon myne owne: Not lookt for chere, in house I kept before, Those spendyng daies, bad spare and seeke for store. But yet small while, I rested here in deede, But that I hard, of one a noble brute: A widdowe wise, of gentill race and seede, And suche a dame, as worthie was of sute, Whose wifely port, and comlie maners graue, (With shamfast looks, and glance of beautie braue:) Was able sure, as worlds report did shoe, To make from tombe, the dedde to speake and goe. Her famous brute, so set my harte on fire, That fancie flam'd, on that I neuer sawe: And still so hotte, did burne this newe desire, That witte confest, in loue there was no lawe. A sodaine heate, and sure a thyng full strange, That loue so sone, could worke so sore a change: To make hym like, and namely in the place, Where loe before, he sawe ne shape nor face. A powre deuine, or Deastnie drewe this draught, It can not come, of light conceits nor toyes: For as wilde birds, in bushe or lime are caught, And so strange handes poore sillie birde enioyes. (Through Deastnies lot, that all appointeth here,) So was I caught, I bye the proofe full dere: For nought but smart, as yet thereby doeth rise, Suche Fortune falls, on men from starrie Skise. Where Gods doe worke, men must of force giue place, It hapned thus, what needs more words here in: Me thought in slepe, I sawe a strangers face, A wake I walkt, as I in mase had bin. In house or feeld, all that I did behold, Presented plaine, this noble fleece of gold: The wandryng Prince, a Iason wisht hym than, Or for that fleece, to be a happie man. In spendyng daies, and tyme of that deuice, A chance befell, as blisfull Fortune wold: The preshoes Iemme, and iewell dere of price, That wandryng Prince, doeth call the fleece of gold. At dinner was, where I was bidde a geast, O happie house, nay rather happie feast: O castell good, where in my Ladie satte, Where but bare vewe, and sight of her I gatte. My gasyng eyes, no soner sawe this sight, But straight I saied, the worlds report was true: And in all poincts, she was the self same wight, That I had heard, and more to saie to you. Her grace so muche, did please my inward minde, That sure I thought, I could not easly finde: So sweete a sainct, to serue and honour still, If boldnesse durst, present here my good will. A feare straight waies, possest my senses all, Of fitter matche, for her then I in deede: And dreadyng sore, how matters forthe would fall, That I might speake, and others then might speede. I silent stoode, and stole a waie God wotte, Yet hopyng still, to finde a better lotte: An aptter tyme, a season for my sute, That fancies toile, should reape some thankfull frute. In watchyng long, and vsyng sleight of witte, I fauour wan, my sorrows to escrie: But Fortune made, me plaie vpon the bitte, And want my will, when hedde I held full hye. I curbed was, and suche a mozroule felt, That in no staye, nor certaine hope I dwelt: Saue that accesse, to her I had somtyme, As on the staire, I durst attempt to clime. I did not preace, the mountaine hye to win, Nor clime the bowes, and spraies of mightie trees: The valley smothe, I tooke greate pleasure in, Or goodlie ley, where haunts somtymes the Bees. To sucke the flowrs, that pleasant Honie makes, And ley to ley, I thought to hedge with stakes: As feeld to feeld, should better sure agree, Then Skie with yearth, or winde and ayre with tree. Short season sure, I sawe good hope here in, Sowre was the sweete, and suger tournd to gall, I sonke where hope, was held vp by the chin, And in dispaire, I likely was to fall. This goodly feeld, this ley alone would be, This soile would not, be hedged in by me: False Fortune fround, and flang from me in haste, And with a freake, left faithfull freend disgraste. Who can haue hold, of Fortune when he liste, She flitts so faste, and flies somtymes so farre: She will not come, like hauke that stoups to fiste, When man thinks best, she mounts as hye as starre, And at a brunt, leau's louers in the duste, O Fortune strange, thou art of little trust: O daintie happe, O Deastnie I thee blame, For thou art she, that tourns to greef my game. All other harms, and former wrongs of myne, The scourges greate, and plag's of forraine soile: Were small to this, that Deastnie doeth assigne, Wherein at home, I take an open foile. All cares of minde, all coste and charge abroad, Not halfe so muche, doeth sillie conscience load: All whiche good Lorde, and all the blame of this, And ground of greef, God wotte blinde Fortune is. I blame no more, though present death I found, By this rebuke, and charmyng checke of chance: Yea though by this, I haue a curelesse wound, And scarre remains, where Cupids darte did glance: In cloked cares, I hide the hurts I haue, And burthen beare, till bodie be in graue: As one whose ghost, with gronyng waests awaie, Whose cold conceits, warme life doeth cleane decaie. So cease good pen, and bid the worlde farewell, No further verse, nor line my hande shall write: This is my laste, this toulls the passyng bell, Of vitall breath, and wished liues delite, This warns the worlde, and bids the wise beware, Of doubtfull chance, the onely cause of care: O faithfull freends, yet shed some teares for me, That through mishap, my wretched ruine doeth se. FINIS. A Pirates Tragedie, beyng a gentleman of a verie good house: Made at the request of Maister Peter Caroe, Capitaine of Laughlin in Irelande: and sette out to shewe the miserable life of Rotter, whose wretched desire of other mens goodes, bringes open shame, and a violente death. When slumbryng slepe, with maiger hande, Gan touche myne eyes, that slouth doeth daunt: When all my limmes, repos'd did stande, And so some reste, to me did graunt. Me thought I sawe, a wretched wight, With wringyng handes, to make his mones: He rather seemd a ghostly spright, That gaspyng lyes, and grouelyng grones. With horie beard, and scorched face, With poudred hedde, and heare vnshorne: With hackes and hewes, in euery place, He seemed like, a man forlorne. His sappe and sauerie sent was past, His youthfull daies, worne in decaie: His mellowed yeres, were gone to wast, His blowmyng spryng, was blowen awaie. His lippes and cheeks, were pale and thinne, His hollowed eyes, were sonke in hedde: His fleshe was frette, nought left but skinne, His marrowe dried, that youth had bredde. His teeth and gummes, like harowes stoode, His furrowed face, like ploughed lande: His vaines did want, their wonted bloode, His sinewes shronke, like knottes did stande. A Sea mans cappe, on hedde he ware, A slidyng sloppe, of Friers graie: A checker Kaep, bothe thinne and bare, To furnishe vp, his queint araie. A gables ende, his girdle made, His shurte besmerde, with Pitche and Tarre: Close by his side, a rustie blade, This carle in youth, a man of warre. A Pilotes compasse, he did holde, To shewe what science he profest: The skill whereof, had made hym bolde, To saile the seas, bothe East and West. This wight with faultryng tonge I saie, Gan curse the prancks, his youth had plaied: And then a loude, withouten staie, With double sighes, these wordes he saied. Woe worthe the yere, the month, the daie, The season, tyme, and instant howre: When first I formed, was in claie, And tooke my shape, in yearthly bowre. Woe worthe the wight, that ioyned fast, My parents handes, in wedlockes rest: Would poison had, been my repast, When first I suckt, my mothers brest. Oh would the Nurse, that bound my hedde, Had brus'd my braine, with bloodie pawe: Or that my Font, had boild with Ledde, When I came bounde, to Christian lawe. Oh would the bandes, my bane had bin, That swadled me, in tender age: Oh would the cloutes, I battelled in, Had been bewitcht, with Cyrces rage. Thou cradell that, rockte me a sleepe, I wishe thy couche, had been my graue: And who so taught, me first to creepe, Some vengeance vile, on hym I craue. When I these thynges, had seen and heard, And throughly waied, this wofull sight: It me appald, and made afeard, Yet ruyng on, his wretched plight. I askt hym then, from whence he came, What cause constraind, hym thus to waile: What life he ledde, and what his name, What strange mishappes, did hym assaile. Here at a while, he held his peace, With wringyng handes, he wipte his eyes: Then my desire, did more encrease, To knowe the cause, of all his cryes. Why staiest thou thus, why doest thou pause, Thou sprite, thou man, thou grisly ghoste: Why standst thou still, shewe me the cause, What troubles now, torment thee moste. Oh meruaile sir, no whit ? he, Muse not to see, me in this case: I was a man, as now you be, Whiche haue mispent, my youthfull race. In Ladron lande, my birthe I tooke, Thalassilestis, once I hight: Bothe name and soule, I well maie brooke, My life from them, deriu'd a right. From noble stocke, by true discent, Unworthie I, my race doeth rise: Good lande I had, but not content, Desire to clime, did blinde myne eyes. My home and soile, I set at nought, My mynde was bent, to wander still: To Court I came, and there I thought, To winne bothe worlde, and wealth at will. This recknyng rashe, was made in hast, Myne hoste was absent you maie see: Then recken twise, least false thou cast, Thus Prouerbes old, doe counsell thee. First looke then leape, and doe not spare, Or els thy shinnes, maie chance to bleede: He sure shall reape, the croppe of care, Of rashe attemptes, that sowes the seede. Who shootes before, he see his marke, No meruell though, he shote a side: In seas vnknowen, who brynges his barke, Without a compase, saileth wide. Who climes the Alpes, withouten guide, No meruaile though, he misse the waie: In Laberynth, who so is tide, If Dedall helpe not, there must staie. O happie you, that learne by me, And my mishappes, your harmes to shunne: Thrise happie thei, that can for see, The rocks whereon, my barke hath runne. In Court thus plast, my self I gaue, With wanton lookes, eche where to gase: All Pecokes plummes, appered braue, Bewitch'd I was, with glorious blase. With hardned harte, I held that haunt, In hope those ioyes, would neuer blinne: I thought no change, of chaunce might daunt, Or stoppe the course, I did beginne. But hoela sir, twas tyme to staie, My braue attire, and wanton braggs: When all my lande, was sold awaie, And rents were rapt, on silken raggs. In Courte I spent, bothe wealth and tyme, Till want had worne, my credite bare: Dewe for suche hedds, as seeke to clyme, Before sure footyng, thei prepare. Some that before, I helpt at neede, And sawe me sinke, thus in decaie: Did start when thei, should stande in steede, Unstedfast then, was all their staie. Suche freendes maie be, compard to Kites, That carrion corses doe deuour: The fleshe consum'd, thei take their flights, Els where to builde, them selues a bowre. A Glasse maie seme, a gemme in vewe, Till he abide, the hammers blowe: And Brasse doeth beare, a golden hewe, Till touche bewraies, his guilfull showe. When that my shippe, had stronger keele, Thei ranne their course, with me aboorde: Now Fortune frounes, thei turne their heele, And scarce can spare, me one good woorde. As frendship faild, I fell a pace, My foes did swarme, with swellyng hate: Too deare I bought, my courtly grace, Doune reeld the proppes, of myne estate. O tickell tyme, that breedes but teares, O sugred sopps, be spicest with gall: O traitrous tree, that berries beares, Whose blossomes gaie, deceiues vs all. As pompe puffes vp, the harte in pride, So plague pluckes doune, the hautie minde: And as the fishe, doeth followe tide, So men runnes after Fortune blinde. I chaste a shadowe in the Sunne, And lookt for happe, where hate remainde, And still the faster did I runne, The more I founde, my self disdainde. The hollowe worlde, all haile would crie, And leade the Lambe, to slaughter soe: And fraude so finely bleard myne eye, I scarce desern'd, a freend from foe. For suche as went, but mere desaite, Would make a shewe, of moste good will: Thus harmelesse swallowed poisoned baite, And I deceiued, by flattrie still. Then findyng Fortunes froward face, That earst was clokte, in craftie cloude: I shapte to shunne, the doubtfull place, That makes the painted Pecocke proude. For as that birde, in borroude plumes, Doeth braue it out, with feathers gaie, So glorious Courtiars haue some rumes, That doeth their sicke, estate bewraie. But when worlde sees, how finesse deales, It makes small count, of glorious shoe: So thus I sought, the salue that heales, Yet founde a medsen mixt with woe. For shunnyng Court, I came to care, Of thynges to come, and perills paste: And put to shiftes, through Fortune bare, A Pirate I became at laste. No minde of birthe, or gentill blood, Could staie the rage, that Rouers haue: My witts were bent, on worldly good, And note how I, might credite saue. For squaryng Dick's, and thriftlesse ladds, The wandryng mates, of Tygers kinde: I sought, and so for golden gadds, To glutt thereby, my greedie minde. Bothe Baie and Rode, and harbryng place, I knewe and there, could closely lye: And stoutly gaue, a Ship the chace, And borde what Barke, did please myne eye. The yeelded men, I flang oure hatche, The riche I fleest, the poore I slewe: From freend or foe, my ladd's would snatche, And daiely seeke, for booties newe. The pries and goods, no soner sold, But bibbe and quaffe, like Baccus knightes: To Dice and dalliance then we wold, And so make short, long Winters nightes. With braulyng blades, then roiste and cutte Or walke the streats, where dames doe dwell: And boltes we had, for eurie butte, And those that shotte, at rouers well. Sometymes our coyne, could stop a gappe, And purchace pardon by a traine: But gallows lucke, and ropripe happe, At length was gwerdon for our paine. In stormes and flawes, we stroue with Seas, In calmes we crept, along the coste: In Sommer tyme, we tooke some ease, In Winter ofte, with tempests toste. And still afferde, of Princes powre, A theeuishe life, dreedes many doubtes: And thei that sought vs euery howre, In Creekes and Hauens laied their scoutes. And so at length, we were espied, And followed faste, and forste to flye: Then serued neither winde nor tied, For we must either yeeld or dye. My mates put all the faulte in me, But that preuail'd no whitte at all: For none of them, from blame stoode free, And our offences were not small. So were we sent vnto the gaile, And some truste vp, to shorten charge: And those that could, by sute preuaile, Escaped death, and went at large. But I in boltes, laie long God wotte, As one that sawe, his ende drawe nere: For sure no pardon could be gotte, I must needes bye, my follie dere. My freendes forsooke me euery one, My foes were glad to see me faste: My wealthe was spent, my goods were gone, And lothsome life, to long did laste. For I was kepte, to waile my sin, And saue the soule, that God had bought: When out of worlde, I would haue bin, I did so pine, awaie with thought. My cheere was bare, my bedde but harde, My robes all rent, and torne to ragges: And worlde but small did me regarde, For all my pride, and former bragges. The daie drewe on, of my dispatche, And that this life, I must forsake: And wondryng worlde, did owrly watche, To heare the ende that I would make: Then through the streats, with glaiu's and bills, In ropes a foote, was prisner ledde: Thus captiu's goe, against their willes, Where some that liu's, bewailes she dedde. Some pittie muche, mans leawdnesse there, And sorie are, to see his ende: And some that neuer lawe did feare, By that their euill liues amende. Some sigh and sobbe, and weepe for woe, Some praie and lifte their handes an hye: And some a heauie face doeth showe, As thei these thyngs beholde with eye. I markt the same, when harte full sadd, In tremblyng breast, laie pantyng sore: And where the death deseru'd I hadd, My greef thereby encreast the more. Then to the Cloudes, I cast vp eyes, And scorn'd to looke on yearthly mosse: As Soule should mount to sacred Skies, And leaue belowe, all worldlie drosse. A sillie tale, I tolde a lasse, Of sondrie synnes, in secret kept: Some freends in hearyng thereof was, That bitterly, my faultes be wept. But whereto serueth all this geare, I loste my life, by Lawe and right: And I must recken other wheare, For faultes I here accounted light. Yet mercie maie, amende my mis, And mercie comes, where grace we craue: When cruell worlde, moste dreadfull is, Of gracious God, we mercie haue. My sadd discourse, is fullie tolde, O man that doest, from slumber rise: Take penne in hande, and doe vnfolde, My fall, and therewith warne the wise. Bidd them beware, that boldly ronne Thei happen not, in hemppen corde: As many a mothers childe hath donne, That neuer throughly fearde the Lorde. Tell Pirates all, what ende I founde, And shewe eche sorte of men my fall: That euery where, in worlde so rounde, My scourge and plague, maie warne them all. O wretched wight, and freende of myne, Quoth I, thy fall, I will sette forthe: So that the cunnyng people fine, Doe take my labour well in worthe. Then rose I from the sleepe I sought, And in at studdie doore I paste: And there to passe this woorke I brought, And sent it to, the Print at laste. So read it as your pleasure is, The man I knewe, and matter bothe: And to be short, be sure of this, This is no toye, but words of trothe. FINIS. A Letter sent from the noble Erle of Ormondes house at Kilkennie, to the honourable sir Henry Sidney, then Lorde Deputie, and liyng at Korke, in Irelande. If witte by Arte, could make my pen to flowe, A flood of skill, should aunswer that I wolde: But lande lefte drie, wher strems should largly grow Small water brook's must sillie springs vnfold, A barraine grounde, can yeeld no grain's of gold. A sorie soile, greate store of rubbishe beares, What neede I thus, to trouble tender eares: With rude deuice, and words more light then winde, When sweeter fraies, should vtter greef of minde. Long was my wishe, to waite on worthie wight, Short was the staie, where Fortunes balls rebound: Some happ maie come, whiells men remaine in sight, But absence breeds, in breast a curelesse wound. And out of minde, it brings a freend I knowe, Thei finde the corne, that reaps where other sowe: Thei catche the cromes, that waites at table round, Thei hitte the marke, that still can plie the bowe, Where saile I now, my shippe is sure on ground. Naie rather loe, I wander on the seas, And trie the stream's, and channells where I pleas: But tossed Bark's, are weather beaten oft, And shaken sore, with surges so a loft: Thei can not come, nor saffely drawe to road, In quiet port, and their discharge their load. Yet haue I been, at Anker nere the Baie, And beaten of, the shore in deepe despite: Where meaner shippps, with calme at pleasure laie, And felt the frute, of all my hopes delite. I muse how drones, and dastard dolts in deede, Dare preace in place, and put their betters backe: Methink's a flowre, should sone disgrace a weede, And vice should blushe, where vertue shewes no lacke. Tushe, men can now, clapp on a face of Brasse, And striue by lookes, to winne the goale and all: Yet when thei spie, their iugglyng in a glasse, Thei tourne their backes, and so forsakes the ball. Suche maskers leaude, would daunce in nette vnseen, And clime the cloudes, where smilyng Gods doe sitte: Yet all thinges are, not as these wodcockes ween, Their blinde beleef, runnes farre beyond their witte. And leades their sence, an ace or twoo a wrie, What though we take, a Parret for a Pye: Some birdes must chatte, to fill our eares with crye, And we well pleas'd, although thei tell a lye: Sutche are the moodes, and humors of our age, Where some must walke, accordyng to the tyme: What then, worlde knowes, these birdes are not it cage, Nor feares the snare, ne falleth in the lyme. A kinde of wormes, there be that eates the Nutte, And leaues the shell, as bare as bare maie bee: Some shooters seeke, but how to hitte the butte, And from the white, thei wishe their shaftes should flee. For if thei ment, true shootyng should be seen, Thei would not fall, to roue on euery green: Nor flatter so, in hope to mende their game, Well some are brought, so farre paste worldly shame. Thei little care, what side doeth lose or winne, Thei neither bette, nor beare a peece of losse: And in the ende, thei proue not worthe a pinne, For all their craft, and creepyng to the crosse. Let faunyng whelps, and gropars of good will: Packe with the reste, and searche what happe will giue, Some other corne, is grinded at my mill, Men maie not looke, by flattrie still to liue. A finer foode, finds fancie for his toeth, But maie a man, be bolde in blont deuice: To tell his minde, and what blinde people doeth, In weedyng thus, my wittes were verie nice. If now I would, not bryng a boxe of spice, To season that, that wanted salte before: When fire goes out, yet stickes I haue in store, To mende the flame, though wood be dere of price. But where the blase, can warme no handes at all, It wakes the witts, and keepes the hedde from sleepe: And makes hym smile, that seeth through stonie wall, Like lurxe and hath, a golden fleece to keepe. Yea Argose eyes, to gard his noble charge, The care whereof, bereau's the minde of reste: And holdes hym in, where others walke at large, To waie this worlde, in ballance of the breste. A heauie weight, the iudgement then doeth beare, The merrie lookes, forsakes the cheerfull face: And sadd conceits, doe creepe in thought I feare, And sorrowe sowre, supplies sweete pleasures place. I see a change, of countnance trust me now, As though a masse, of matter mou'd the minde: And who so notes, the sodaine bended browe, By outward shewe, an inward cause shall finde. Of troubled sprite, O leaue that of in tyme: Those gripyng greefes, and gnawyng wormes are nought Call for some sportes, or read some triflyng ryme, To take awaie, the ground of greeuous thought. In sutche extreemes, fine Christmas games are good, And Musicks sounde, reuiues the drouzie braine: A tale well told, of merie Robbin Hood, The wandryng harte, it shall bryng home againe. A Figge for those, that stands like statues still, And stares in face, to feede thei knowe not what: And wheeles about, like horse that turns the Mill, Yet gaine no more, then prettie pusse our Cat. That seekes for Mouse, when other game is gone, The witlesse foole, for Fishe maie catche a Frogge: And wantyng fleshe, maie bite vpon a bone, So to the fire, the lubber beares the logge. Because his strength, doeth passe his fellowes farre, Now shoote I wrong, I knowe not where I dribbe: Except my bolte, doe hitte some blasyng starre, Tushe, thats a toye, let Tomkin talke of Tibb. And moue some mirthe, to make the season short, It breedes good blood, and puffes vp Lenten cheekes: When all is doen, men lengthen life with sport, Some feede on loue, as Larkes doe liue with Leekes. Some take suche thought, thei sleepe vntill thei snort, Some neuer wakes, to doe their neighbours good: Some can not spare, their freends a good report, Some wade bare legg'd, to moile for mucke and mood. Some shewe good will, yet beare greate hate in brest, Some make small signes, and bidds you iudge the rest: Some seem like waxe, that neuer melt with fire, Some are as cold, as Ice or frosen Snowe: Some through the nose, doe easely drawe a wire, Some plaies the sheepe, and proues a crabbed shroe. Some lackes no legges, yet knowes not where to goe, Some walkes too farre, their pace is out of rule: Some comes to short, of that we wishe to haue, Some haue as mutche, good maners as a Mule. Some faunes like whelpe, that still the taile can waue. In fine this some, maie sommond be for nought, Yet fill thei vp, the some of basest thought: More greater mindes, there are of finer mold, Whose hartes disdaine, to stoupe to base delites: Thei shine like pearle, and glitter like the gold, The noble Haukes, that staines the dunghill Kites. The worthie birdes, that soers in loftie Skies, The ioye of Gods, and glorie greate of menne: The whippe to fooles, and beautie of the wise, The whetstone smothe, whereon we sharpe our penne. Some sutche haue force, to winne a worlde with lookes, To teare the harts, out of the bloodie brest: Suche yearthly gods, doeth sitte in secret nookes, And tune the stryngs, of state without a wrest. And suche in deede, are double treble blest. No soner thei, pronounce a worde or twaine, A silence streight, by listnyng eares we finde: That what we heare, our senses maie retaine, And locke it vp, in iudgement of the minde. And whiles we note, the sweetnesse of their frase, We lose our selues, and carried are awaie: From that we were, so standyng then at mase, The feeld is loste, no tournyng face that daie, The feight is doen, and broken is the raie. There is a stone, that drawes hard Iron ye knoe, So is there wood, that water turnes to stones: Then are there men, that gouerne where thei goe, And haue a gift, of Nature for the nones. To daunt the proude, and strike the hautie doune, Beleeue me now, I knoe who weares a croune: And when she lists, to plaie the Lyons part, Her words a lone, can make men couche by art. Not for her place, but for her grace is suche, To conquer those, that ought her subiectes bee: The self same powre, myne inward sprite doeth touche, Where rightly borne, the regall sworde I see. For if he speake, that doeth her place supplie, I yeeld vp all, farewell bothe sence and skill: I knowe eche birde, obaies the Egles eye, No fishe in flood, but feares the Dolphin still. The Lyons lookes, makes euery beast to bowe, The pretie Bees, when that their kyng doeth hom: Attendance giues, in decent order throwe, And in a swarme, together will thei come. If beasts and birds, and fishe and Flies doe soe, A man were blinde, that doeth no duetie knowe: Then why am I, so long from Corke you aske, The cause is knowne, when to the North we went: I euer laie, like one that tooke a taske, Of corne to thrashe, and till the strawe was spent. I had no bed, yea twelue long weekes at least, I shifted out, and laie as badd as beast. Then drewe we home, from sauage countrey wilde, But Harbenger, no better order tooke: I durst not then, complaine like little childe, That flings from schoole, and madly burnes his booke. So then for sleepe, and ease I gan to looke. And left the streame, where fishe for place doeth striue, But lothe to part, yet glad to lye in sheetes: Because with reste, our daies awaie we driue, And laisure finde, to charme and coniour spreets. A cunnyng knacke, for shreaude and wicked heddes, That watche the Moone, and searche in gardein beddes: What hearbs are good, to make a wilde Gose tame, And where and how, the madde dogge must be cuerd: That is no arte, but for old distaffe dame, That looks like witche, whose practise hath procuerd. A Horse or Mare, to swell and pine to death, Some saie for sport, these Callioghes knowes a knacke: To blowe doune trees, thei haue so strong a breath, What needes more words, a plague take all the packe, That plaies foule plaie, in house, in holt, or heath. Let trifles passe, I vse some houshold talke, And write of state, and how the worlde doeth frame: Muche shall thei heere, that long abroad doeth walke, And haue some sight, and skill to marke the same. Thei saie this lande, hath many sores and greues, That fewe or none, doe seeke to salue a right: And is so spoield, by Rebells, Knaues, and Theues, (And bareleggd Kerne, whiche setts all goodnesse light) That worse and worse, the common wealth doeth waxe, Why eury hedde, should members badd reforme: And if men please, to take the fire from flaxe, The kiruell sweete, should sone be safe from worme. Though some haue sought, their onely priuate gaine, And fedd on fleece, that from the flocke did fall: Yet grace is lefte, and hope there doeth remaine, That some doeth liue, to mende the mischiues all. But to be plaine, I heare a wofull crie, The noyes whereof, resounds through starrie Skie. The poore that liues, by toyle of sweate and browes, (And nere good tounes, where eche man knowes his own:) Can not be free, nor well enioye their plowes, Thei are in deede, with sesse, so ouerthrown. In any place, where proudest people dwell, Whose rule is mixt, with rage and rigor still: Was neuer seen, nor felt so foule an hell, As this good Lorde, where waest doeth what it will. Suche as be borne, as free as we our selues, And tilles the ground, and dearely paies therefore: (And for their babes, full truely diggs and delues) In their moste neede, we plague and scourge full sore. Beyond the course, of reason, lawe and right, A cruell cace, and twise as heauie a sight: To see the weake, with strongest thrust to wall, And lose their goods, and not the halfe but all. The people saie, were coyne and liurey gon, The lande would sure, with Milke and Home floe: Their trust is now, redresse is commyng on, And hauocke shall, to hatefull harbour goe. Why striue I thus, to thunder in the aire, That neuer knewe, how raine in season fell: When stormes are past, and weather waxeth faire, By heauens blisse, we shon the paines of hell. When peace bears frute, and wicked warre decaies: I gage my life, that all thyng shalbe well, And worlde will saie, we liue in happie daies. No floure at first, can yeeld a perfite smell, Till tyme bryngs forthe, fr? stalke bothe budds and leaues, Who seeks for nutts, till hardned be the shell, The kirnell wantes, and so hym self deceiues. The mynds of men, would quickly haue their wishe, And haue suche haste, of that thei doe desire, That often tyme, without good skill thei fishe: Or leapyng dike, thei light a mid the mire. Who will not staie, for weather, winde, and flood, Shall saile but selde, and see no forraine soile: It must be tyme, that doeth the people good, As Haruest comes, of labour paine and toile. To enter thus, in matters of greate weight, Would vexe the witts, of riper hedds then myne: Tis better vse, the penne with simple sleight, Then in graue things, to make the frase too fine: As ynkehorne termes, smells of the schoole sometyme, So farre fetcht words, are farsed full of larde: And paper stouft, with store of stretched ryme, Doeth turne againe, disgraest without regarde. Els flong a side, or laied in windoe nooke: As fancies vaine, whereon fewe wisemen looke. There pause a while, God sheeld my labour soe, Were loste my Lorde, thei coste me further paine: A mornynges muse, a merrie freake ye knoe, A whole nights watche, a broken slepe or twaine. Though trifles come, from hedds full fraught with toyes, Some get greate thanks, for pinnes and lases light: We like no Drone, nor Bagpipe for the noyes, Nor Maie poull mirthe, for any showe or sight. But for the sport, and gladnesse that thei bryng: Whose chearfull sound, makes heauie sad men syng, A noble arte, is Musicke sure I finde, For noble life, that marchant doeth maintaine: He can make sale, of feathers in the winde, And sell good cheape, a drousie adell braine: Yet Musicke not, compares with merrie minde, For that bryngs blood, to eurie vitall vaine. And heaues vp harte, from dongeon of dispaire: To be as blithe, as birde in open aire. If any glance, of matter be in this, Past merrie meane, yet merrie muse it is: That leades my penne, I sweare by heauens blis. Wherefore in mirthe, I praie you take these lines, My duetie maie, excuse my boldnesse here: I borrowd not, my wordes of graue deuines, Nor of fine wittes, that holdes small dainties dere. Thei came good cheape, from merrie nourses papp, Good chepe thei goe, where muses fauour moste: But dere thei are, if writer finde mishapp, Thereby, and worlde, account the labour loste. God graunt the tyme, be good when thei were sent, And that eche worde, be taken as I ment: The best is sure, and that is moste to praies, Thei goe to one, I honour all my daies. FINIS. The Epitaphe of the rare vertuous Prince (and towardes Impe of grace) Kyng Edward the sixte. The Lampe is out, that lightned Englishe harts, Whose liuely shoe, and beautie shoen so bright: And gaue suche ioye, to all our inward smarts, That well was hym, that had thereon a sight. Edward I meane, whiche was our kyng by right. The golden torche, and candle matutine, Did blase and burne, within his Christall eyne, But well awaie, those lookes their life hath loste, Full dimme and darcke, Is now that sparke: That whilome was, the staie of Englandes boaste. Now Death hath dried, this pleasaunt princely plant, And hent our happ, an hye aboue the skyes: Who knowes the losse, but those, that feele the want, Wherefore the teares, distilled from our eyes. But since this babe, hath made his sacrifies. And yeelded vp, his life and vitall breath: What can ye blame, but hastie cruell death. Whiche pluckt the Rose, before his leaues were spredde, Yet shall his name, Remaine with fame: And florishe still, although the flowre be dedde. A face so fraught, with fauour bloomyng still, A cheere so chaste, subduyng eche desire, A hedde so ripe, with grace and connyng skill: A tong so deckt, and cladd in trothes attire, A harte so meeke, and cleane deuoide of yre. An eare so pure, to heare the poore mannes cause: A witte to iudge, a zeale to make good lawes. A hande so clere, from blood, looke well thereon, Was seldome seene, In Kyng ne Queene: Helas the while, our Lanterns light is gon. His witte wanne praise, as by his waies apperes, His vertuous stepps, wan fame emong the wice, His tender youth, did teache the aged yeres: His sober life, rebuked euery vice, His woords and works, did passe the pearle in price. His gestures all, if thei were grauen in gold: A mirrour were, to learne bothe yong and old. Wherfore the vnfitte, the yearth is for his graue, His place of reast, Is Abrams breast: A worthie tombe, for suche a Kyng to haue. Finis. The Epitaphe of the worthie Erle of Essex. I blushe to write, in verse, a matter of suche weight, That makes the hearars shed some teares, and moueth sorrowe streight: In graue and statly stile, this tale should sounded be: Too base for suche greate cause I finde, my slender muse and me. My harte doeth bleede in breast, my pen in hande doeth shake, Mine inward sprits doe wepe for woe, this sad discourse to make, But though with heauie newes, a while I fill your eares, The fame I write of this great m?, to ioy shall turne your tears Yea greate of birthe and minde, and fewe so greate as he, For daiely through desarts he grewe, in greatnesse by degree: A Cæsars harte he boare, that neuer shronke nor quaild, A courage that against his foes, in all attemptes preuaild. A hedde that could conceiue, as farre as cause was found, A bodie apt for warlike broiles, where bountie did abound: Yea for his bountie greate, a prince in very deede, That made no more account of gold, then of a rotten reede. The noble giftes he gaue, a worlde of worthies wan, Was neuer seen, in Britaine bred, for bountie suche a man. An Erle and liuely Lorde, as milde as is the Doue, Whose courtuous speeche &amp; pleasant port, did purchase peoples loue. A freend to all good men, as faste and true as steele, That would not wagg w? worlds abuse, &amp; turn about like wheele A pearlesse subiect sure, that Englandes honour sought, And carde not with what losse of goods, his countrey gaine was bought Full bent to Marciall feats, a Mars in deede well tried, Abroad in feeld where men are known, and cowards easly spied: The care of publique weale, laie wakyng in his eyes, A noble Soldiour framde by kinde, in best and brauest gyes. A house and houshold kept, so frankly euery where, That all the lookers on would saie, some prince was placed there The Soldiours swarmd like Bees, about his stately gate, He was a Lanterne of this land, and Mirrhour of the state. In all thyngs that he did, then what a losse had they: That comes to see his noble shrine, and findes the sainct awey. O freends that honord hym, and faithfull seruaunts bothe, Come weepe with me, &amp; shew thereby, some signe of your great trothe For I haue lost a freeud, and for his sake I vowe, To plant my penne vpon his tombe, and rest from writyng now Till I his like maie finde, whiche hardly shalbe don: O Essexe of renowmed fame, thy race is nobly ron.
