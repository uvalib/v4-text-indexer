      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS Most Excellent Majesty GEORGE OF Great Britain, France and Ireland KING, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c. THIS New Version OF THE Psalms of David Is most humbly Dedicated BY His Majesty's most obedient Subject and Servant Richard Blackmore Psalm I. Common Metre. 1 O happy Man, who shuns all Day Th' Ungodly's Walks with Care; Who stands not in the Sinner's Way, Nor takes the Scorner's Chair. 2But makes the Precepts of the Lord His Joy and chief Delight; And on his Sacred Will and Word Contemplates Day and Night. 3He'll, like a Tree by Waters fed, His Fruit in Season give; He his unfading Leaf shall spread, And always prosp'rous live. 4Not so th' Ungodly, they shall fly, Like Chaff before the Wind; And driv'n about in vain shall try A resting Place to find. 5The Wicked cannot, when arraign'd, Stand in the Judgment, sure, Nor enter with Transgression stain'd Th' Assembly of the Pure. 6For the Just God the Righteous knows, Who still his Laws obey, But Sinners, who his Will oppose, Shall perish in their Way. Another Metre. 1 O happy Man, that all the Day Avoids th' Ungodly's Walks with Care; Who stands not in the Sinner's Way, And sits not in the Scorner's Chair: 2But makes the Precepts of the Lord His dearest Pleasure and Delight, And on his sacred Will and Word, Contemplates all the Day and Night. 3He's like a Tree by Waters fed, That dos his Fruit in Season give, He his unwith'ring Leaf shall spread, And shall in all Things prosp'rous live. 4Not so the vile ungodly Race, They no such happy State shall find; For they, like Chaff, from Place to Place, Shall fly before the driving Wind. 5Behold, the Wicked, when arraign'd, In Judgment cannot stand the Light, Nor enter, with Transgression stain'd, The Congregation of th' Upright. 6For the Just God approves and knows The Righteous, who his Laws obey; But Sinners, who his Will oppose, Shall surely perish in their Way. Psalm II. 1 Why rage the Heathen? and vain Things Tumultuous Tribes devise? 2See, Kings against the King of Kings And his Anointed rise. The Rulers of the Earth and Lords, Bold Counsel take, and say, 3Come let us break the binding Cords, And cast their Yoke away. 4The Lord, who sits above the Skies, Shall their vain Threats deride; 5His Wrath their Madness shall chastise, His Fury blast their Pride. 6Yet I've anointed, in despite Of all, who cross'd my Will, And set by my resistless Might, My King on Zion's Hill. 7For thus the Lord bespoke me, See, I my Decree declare, This Day have I begotten Thee, My only Son and Heir. 8Do Thou the Nations ask of me, And I'll the Nations give; All Realms shall Thy Possessions be, And Kings Thy Subjects live. 9For Thou shalt stubborn Lands around With Rods of Iron tear, Dash them in pieces, and confound Thy Foes, like Potter's Ware. 10Ye Judges, who Tribunals sway, Ye Kings, Instruction hear, 11Rejoyce with trembling, and obey Your Judge and King with fear. 12Worship the Son with holy Joy, Lest Anger seize his Breast, And Wrath scarce kindled you destroy; Trust in him and be blest. Another Metre. 1 Why do the Heathen Nations rage? The People vain Ambition feed? Why in absurd Designs engage, In which they never can succeed? 2Kings of the Earth tumultuous rise, And Rulers close in Counsel joyn, Against the Lord, in Plots unwise, And his anointed King combine. 3By us, say they, of this new Lord Be the proud Bands asunder broke, And let us cast away the Cord, That to our Neck ties fast the Yoke. 4The Lord enthron'd in Heav'n on high Shall laugh to see their boastful Pride; Shall all conspiring Pow'rs defy, And all their empty Threats deride. 5He shall in Wrath Destruction speak, And overwhelm them with Distress, And in his sore Displeasure break Their strong Assurance of Success. 6Yet I've anointed, in despite Of Princes, who oppos'd my Will, And set by my resistless Might, My King on Zion's holy Hill. 7I will the high Decree declare, The Lord hath said concerning me, I own Thee for my Son and Heir, This Day have I begotten Thee. 8Of me the Heathen Realms demand, The Heathen Realms shall be Thy own, And the remotest Tracts of Land Shall be the Portion of my Son. 9For thou shalt stubborn Lands around With vengeful Rods of Iron tear, Dash them in Pieces, and confound Those wicked Foes like Potters Ware. 10Therefore the Voice of Wisdom hear, Ye Kings, ye Judges Truth discern, 11Obey and serve the Lord with fear, And to rejoyce with trembling learn. 12Worship the Son with holy Joy. Lest growing Anger seize his Breast, And Wrath scarce kindled you destroy; All, who confide in him, are blest. Psalm III. 1 Lord, how my Troublers are encreas'd? What Troops against me rise? 2They say that God with me displeas'd To help my Soul denies. 3But thou, Jehovah, art a Shield Around thy Servant spread; My Glory, Thou thy Aid wilt yield, To raise my sinking Head. 4I sought the Lord, he heard me pray From Holy Zion's Height, 5I slept by Night and wak'd by Day Supported by his Might. 6No Terror can my Soul surprize, Nor will I stand in Awe, Tho' Thousands of the People rise, And threatning round me draw. 7Rise, save me, Lord my God, my Foes Thou mad'st to feel thy Stroke, On their Cheek-bone, and by thy Blows Th' Ungodly's Teeth hast broke. 8To Thee, O Lord, to Thee alone Belongs all saving Pow'r; On Jacob's Seed, by Choice Thy own, Thou dost Thy Blessings show'r. Psalm IV. 1 God Witness of my Righteousness, O, when I call, give Ear; Thou hast inlarg'd me in Distress, My Pray'r in Mercy hear. 2How long, ye Sons of Men, will ye My Glory turn to Shame? How long persist in Vanity, And make a Lye your Aim? 3But know, the Lord has set apart The Righteous for his own; He'll hear, when from an upright Heart I supplicate his Throne. 4Then stand in Awe and do not stray, Nor from just Ways depart; Calmly in Bed your Actions weigh, And commune with your Heart. 5Of Righteousness to God on high Oblations now prepare, Then stedfast on his Aid rely, And on him cast your Care. 6The Way, say many, who will trace How we may Good possess? But with the Light of Thy pleas'd Face, O Lord, thy Servants bless. 7Thou fill'st my Heart with Joy Divine, With more Delight and Peace, Than they can boast, whose Corn and Wine Abundantly encrease. 8Now will I seek my Bed, and there To peaceful Sleep apply, For, Lord, alone Thy watchful Care Makes me in Safety ly. Psalm V. 1 Lord, to my Words Attention pay, Consider graciously and weigh The Meditation of my Heart; 2To Thee my King, my God I fly, In Mercy hear my mournful Cry, For I'll to Thee my Wants impart. 3Soon as the Night forsakes the Air, To Thee I'll make my morning Pray'r; Ev'n at the early Dawn of Day My Supplication I'll direct To Thee with pure devout Respect, Look out and for an Answer stay. 4God do's in Ill no Pleasure take, Nor with the Wicked Friendship make, Nor in their Evil Ways delight; 5But hates them, who in Sin rejoyce, And make Iniquity their Choice, And will not bear them in his Sight. 6God to destroy such Men is bent, Who Slanders spread, and Lyes invent, To blast their blameless Neighbour's Name; Nor do's he less abhor their Ways, Who seek by Blood or Fraud to raise Their Profit, or increase their Fame. 7But I, by Goodness often prov'd, And Thy abundant Mercy mov'd, Will to Thy Sacred House repair; And in thy Fear and Righteousness I'll to thy Holy Place address Low Adoration, Praise and Pray'r. 8Since o'er my Steps my Foes are Spies, Lord, guide my Heart and make me wise, That I may always walk upright, That Innocence I may maintain, Nor err from Truth, make smooth and plain Thy Righteous Ways before my Sight. 9In specious Words they Hate conceal, And feed within an eager Zeal, By guileful Words my Name to wrong; Their rav'ning Throat with Slaughter fed Swallows, like open Tombs, the Dead, And false and flattering is their Tongue. 10Condemn them, Lord, as guilty all, And let them by the Counsels fall Fram'd in their own deceitful Mind; Since they against Thee have rebell'd, Let the Transgressors be expell'd, Nor here a peaceful Dwelling find. 11But you may Triumph, who confide In God your safe Defence and Guide; You, who his holy Name respect, By your loud Shouts your Joys express, 12For God will sure the Righteous bless, And as a Buckler, them protect. Psalm VI. 1 To chasten me, O gracious God, In Anger do not chuse; Nor ever Thy correcting Rod In hot Displeasure use. 2O spare me, Lord, in Pity spare, For weak and faint I ly, O Lord, my Bones tormented are, Thy healing Art apply. 3My Soul too feels great Misery, Still Wailings shall I make? 4Return, O Lord, deliver me, For Thy great Mercy's sake. 5Is there among the silent Dead Remembrance of thy Name? Or can the Grave's unlightsome Bed, Lord, Thanks to Thee proclaim? 6I'm tir'd with Groans, that endless grow, When Sleep the weary chears, I make my Bed to swim and flow, And drench my Couch with Tears. 7My melting Eye consumes away, Because of Grief and Woes, It waxeth old and feels decay, By reason of my Foes. 8From me let all the hateful Crew, That Evil work, depart, The Lord will rescue me and shew My Tears have mov'd his Heart. 9As he in Pity, when implor'd, Has heard and eas'd my Want, So will he future Aid afford, And my Petition grant. 10Let all my Foes be sorely vext, And in Confusion mourn; Let them be suddainly perplext, And overthrown return. Psalm VII. 1 On Thee, my God, I undismay'd My Trust entire repose, O save me, Lord, by timely Aid From persecuting Foes. 2Lest on my Soul, the Foe I fear, Should, like a Lyon, fly; And raging me in Pieces tear, When none to help is nigh. 3If I this Thing did act or will, Of which I am arraign'd; Lord, if my Hands from doing Ill, I've not with Care restrain'd; 4If I did Hurt to him decree, Who was with me at Peace, (Yea, Lord, my causless Enemy I freely did release,) 5He let him persecute, a Prey Left to his bloody Lust; Bread on the Earth my Life; and lay My Honour in the Dust. 6Stir, Lord, and in thy Anger rise Because of my proud Foe; Awaken at my earnest Cries, And threaten'd Judgment show. 7So shall the Tribes Thee compass round, Then for thy People's sake, That I may innocent be found, Thy Throne to judge me take. 8I to the Judge of all appeal, If I have righteous been, Acquit me, else my Guilt reveal, And, Lord, condemn my Sin. 9Let wicked Malice waste away, Establish Thou th' Upright; Thou try'st the Heart, and dost survey The Reins by searching Light. Part II. 10God is my shelt'ring Shield and Stay, Who upright Men defends, 11God's a just Judge, and every Day Threats to the Wicked sends. 12Should he not change his Course, the Lord Will make him Vengeance know, And for that End has whet his Sword, Prepar'd and bent his Bow. 13His Instruments with slaughter stain'd, His Arms are ready made; His fatal Arrows are ordain'd Oppressours to invade. 14See, he Iniquity conceives, He Mischief breeds within, Nor incompleat his Travel leaves, But brings forth ripen'd Sin. 15Fal'n in the Pit, he dug for me, The baffled Foe shall mourn: 16On his own Head his Cruelty, And wrongs shall sure return. 17Because of God's most Righteous Ways, I'll Thanks with Zeal express; And I, thy Name in Songs of Praise, O Lord most high, will bless. Psalm VIII. 1 O Lord, our Lord, how Excellent Is thro' the Earth thy Name? The Heav'n of Heav'ns is in Extent Unequal to thy Fame. 2Thou mad'st the Mouths of Infants young With pow'rful Praise resound, Thus to strike dumb the impious Tongue, And vengeful Foe confound. 3When I th' extended Heav'ns behold, The Work of thy Right Hand, The Moon and Stars in Order roll'd On High by thy Command; 4Lord, what is Man, that he should see Thou keep'st him in thy Mind? The Son of Man that Thou should'st be To visit him so kind. 5For Thou hast made him next below Thy Angels in Renown, Do'st on him Dignity bestow, And with Dominion crown. 6Thou mad'st all Creatures to his Throne Submissive Homage pay, And bad'st the World his Empire own, And his Commands obey. 7Flocks, Herds, and Beasts that range the Plain, All Fowl, that fly in Air, 8All Fish, that dwell amid'st the Main, And ev'ry Creature there. 9O Lord, our Lord, of what Extent Is thy unrivall'd Fame? Thro' all the Earth how Excellent, And Glorious is thy Name? Another Metre. 1 O Lord, our Lord, how Excellent Thro' all the Nations is thy Name? The Heav'n of Heav'ns is in Extent Unequal to Thy boundless Fame. 2Thou from their Mouths, that suck the Breast, Because of Foes hast Strength ordain'd, That thus the Foe may be supprest, And the Avenger's Rage restrain'd. 3When I the Heav'ns, surprizing Sight! By Thee stretch'd forth on high behold, The Moon and Stars, vast Globes of Light, By thy Command in order roll'd; 4Lord, what is Man, that Thou should'st mind His Welfare with such tender Care? The Son of Man, that he should find Thee Gracious, and thy Bounty share? 5For Thou hast made him of a Race, Next to th' angelick Rank renown'd, And hast his Head with princely Grace, With Glory and with Empire crown'd. 6On whom Dominion unconfin'd O'er all thy Works Thou hast bestow'd; O'er Things of ev'ry diff'rent Kind, Which from thy Pow'r Creative flow'd. 7O'er Herds and Flocks, the Farmer's Care; O'er Beasts, that thro' the Forrest stray; O'er Birds, that wing their Flight in Air, And Fish, that cut thro' Waves their Way. 9O Lord, our Lord, how Excellent Thro' all the Nations is thy Name! The Heav'n of Heav'ns is in Extent Unequal to thy boundless Fame! Psalm IX. 1 With all my Heart I'll laud, And Thee, O Lord, confess, I'll spread thy mighty Deeds abroad, And wond'rous Works express. 2In Thee I will rejoyce, Be glad, and Grief defy, And to thy Name, with cheerful Voice, Sing Praise, O Thou most High. 3When I the Foe dismay, And put his Troops to Flight, They fall and perish in their Way, Confounded at thy Sight. 4Thou hast maintain'd my Cause, At thy Tribunal try'd, And judging by impartial Laws, Thou did'st for me decide. 5Thou on the Lands hast frown'd, And laid the Heathen waste; Their Nations are no more renown'd, For evermore eras't. 6Thou shalt no more, proud Foe, Succeed in lawless Aims, No more our Cities overthrow, And with them sink their Names. 7Tho' Towns and People fail, The Lord shall still endure; His Throne establish'd shall prevail, Prepar'd for Judgment sure. 8He'll judge the World at length, And Right to all dispence: 9Th' Oppress'd shall find in him their Strength Sure Refuge and Defence. 10And those that know Thee, Lord, In Thee will still confide, Convinc'd, that on thy plighted Word None yet in vain rely'd. Part II. 11In Songs Jehovah laud, Who do's in Zion dwell, Among the People all abroad His wond'rous Doings tell. 12When for the Blood of Saints, God shall Inquiry make, He'll not forget Just Mens Complaints, But dreadful Vengeance take. 13Have Mercy on me, Lord, How Foes afflict me, See; From the dark Gates of Death restor'd, My Life I owe to Thee; 14That I in Zion's Gates May shew forth all thy Praise; Rejoycing 'midst th' assembled States I'll thy Salvation raise. 15By Pits, which they prepar'd, The Heathen are betray'd, And by the Net their Foot's insnar'd, Which they in secret laid. 16The Lord is thro' the Lands For Righteous Deeds renown'd; Whereas, the Works of his own Hands, The Wicked shall confound. 17The Proud on Evil set Shall quickly sink to Hell, Where all the Realms, who God forget, In utter Darkness dwell. 18The Needy for Defence Still shall not cry in vain, Nor of afflicted Innocence, Or prosp'rous Guilt complain. 19Arise and plead thy Right, Lord, let not Man prevail, Judge Thou the Realms, and with thy Might Th' ungodly Tribes assail. 20Thy Wrath let Heathens bear, Let Fear their Souls possess, They'll then reflect, and, that they are No more than Men, confess. Psalm X. 1 Wherefore, Jehovah, standest Thou In so remote a Place? At Times, when we are sunk in Woe, Why do'st Thou hide Thy Face? 2The Wicked insolent and vain The poor Afflicted grieve: Caught in the Snares, let them remain, Which they with Craft conceive. 3The Proud enjoy their Heart's Desire, Wealth is their boastful Theme; They praise Men eager to acquire Great Gain, and God blaspheme. 4While vain Conceits feed self Applause, God is not by him sought, No God, or none that gives forth Laws, Is ever in his Thought. 5Success his painful Labours find, Thy Ways surmount his Sight; He boasts his Breath, as Blasts of Wind, Shall put his Foes to Flight. 6Disdainful in his Heart, says he, I shall not be remov'd; For I shall never Evil see, Nor ever be reprov'd. 7His Mouth is full of impious Oaths, Lyes, Vanity, and Pride; Beneath his Tongue, that Goodness loaths, Deceit and Mischief hide. 8Near Villages he skulking lyes To seize the Poor intent, And watches close with lurking Eyes To slay the Innocent. 9He like a Lyon in his Den Waits, on Destruction set; He waits, and catches needy Men, When drawn into his Net. 10He stoops and crouches to surprize, And do's the Field survey, That undiscover'd he may rise, And tear the Poor his Prey. Part II. 11Oft in their Minds these Thoughts have Place, God do's not care to know, He turns his Eyes and hides his Face, From what is done below. 12Arise, O Lord, lift up Thy Hand, O God, the Proud to smite; For the Distress'd and Humble stand, And vindicate their Right. 13Why do the impious God contemn? Thus in his Heart he lays, That thou his Works do'st not condemn, Nor regulate his Ways. 14Thou saw'st, for Thou do'st Cruelty Behold, and wilt reward: The Poor commits himself to Thee, Thou do'st the Orphan guard. 15Do Thou confound the wicked One, The evil Man withstand; Seek out his Wickedness till none Be found thro' all the Land. 16The Lord is King, whose Glorious Reign For ever shall endure; While Heathen Lords no more remain, Where now we dwell secure. 17The Meek to Thee did, Lord, convey Their Cries, and Thou did'st hear; Thou wilt prepare their Hearts to pray, And lend a Gracious Ear. 18To judge the Poor and Fatherless, Who sorely are opprest, That mortal Man may Fear confess, Nor more the Just molest. Psalm XI. 1 My Soul with Hope thy Promise fills, Then why do my Advisers cry, To Mountains, Caves, or lonely Hills, Swift as a Bird for Safety fly? 2The Wicked bend their Bow, and make Their Arrows ready on the String, And Aim from lurking Places take Destruction on the Good to bring. 3If the Foundations, Right, and Laws, Are by Oppression broken thro', What to withstand the pow'rful Cause Can the few friendless Righteous do? 4In Heav'n his Holy Place on High The Lord sits awful on his Throne; He views all Nations with His Eye To prove, and makes Mens Actions known. 5He do's the righteous Man chastise, And tries his Patience by the Smart; But do's the Violent despise, And hates the Wicked from his Heart. 6He on the Wicked Snares shall rain, Torments and vengeful Tempests pour, Brimstone and Fire and dreadful Pain, (Sad Portion!) shall th' Unjust devour. 7For the most Righteous Lord do's place His Love on Truth and Righteousness, And with the Brightness of his Face, He will the Just and Faithful bless. Psalm XII. 1 Lord, help, for in this cruel Age Compassion is unknown: None on the Side of Heav'n engage, Nor Faith and Justice own. 2See, all Men trust in speaking wrong, And act a treach'rous Part, False and deceitful is their Tongue, And double is their Heart. 3The Lord shall flatt'ring Lips confound, And haughty Men destroy, That boasting with proud Words abound, And scornful Speech employ. 4Shall not our Tongues prevail, say they, Are not our Lips our own? To us what Lord of sov'reign Sway Shall dictate from his Throne? 5To save the Needy and Opprest, I, saith the Lord, arise; From his strong Foe the Man I'll wrest, Whom scoffing you despise. 6God will perform, what he design'd, His Promises are sure; His Words, as Silver when refin'd, And often try'd, are pure. 7From which assur'd by His Decree The Lord will never swerve; But to the last Posterity Will firm His Truth preserve. 8The Wicked triumph, Vice is prais'd, And Guilt o'erspreads the Land, When vile and worthless Men are rais'd To Trusts and high Commands. Psalm XIII. 1 Lord, me how long wilt Thou forget? For ever shall it be? The Light of Thy blest Face is set, When shall it rise to me? 2How long shall I, o'erwhelm'd with Woe, Take Counsel in my Soul? How long shall my exalted Foe My Friends and me controul? 3My God consider, to my Pray'r Thy Ear attentive keep; Lighten my Eyes, lest in Despair I sleep of Death the Sleep. 4Lest they exclaim with taunting Voice, We have his Soul distrest; And they, who trouble me, rejoyce, Whil'st I can find no Rest. 5But on thy Mercy I rely And Goodness Infinite, And thy Salvation, Lord most High, Shall be my Heart's Delight. 6O Lord, my God, I'll joyful raise My Voice, thy Name to bless: I'll for Thy Bounty sing thy Praise, And Thanks devout express. Psalm XIV. 1 Oft in his Heart the Fool thus says, There is no Mighty God; They are corrupt, vile are their Ways, Just Paths by none are trod. 2The Lord look'd down from Heav'n to view The Race of human Kind, And learn, if any rightly knew, And sought th' Eternal Mind. 3From Justice all are gone astray, And all unclean are grown; Are there of God's most righteous Way Observers? No not one. 4Ye Wicked, by ill Counsels led, Unknowing are ye all, Who eat my People up as Bread, Nor on th' Almighty Call? 5They at their Heart felt grievous Pain, And Agonies of Fear; For God do's with the Just remain, A People to him dear. 6You have the Counsel of the Poor Expos'd, and put to Shame, Because the Lord, whom they adore, They as their Refuge claim. 7From Zion who'll Salvation give, And back our Captives bring? Then Jacob shall in Triumph live, And Israel glad shall sing. Psalm XV. 1 Who, Lord, is in thy holy Place Judg'd worthy to abide? What Man among the chosen Race Shall in thy Hill reside? 2He, who unbiass'd walks upright, To Justice do's adhere; Brings from his Heart the Truth to Light, To God and Man sincere. 3He, who do's others ne'er defame, Nor sland'rous Tales devise, And ne'er, to blast his Neighbour's Name, Takes up reproachful Lyes: 4Who an ungodly Person hates, Loves all who fear the Lord, And to his Hurt observes his Oaths, And keeps unchang'd his Word: 5He that abhors base Usury, Nor stains his Hands with Bribes: Such Persons shall rewarded be Among the righteous Tribes. Psalm XVI. 1 Preserve, O Lord, and succour me, My Hopes on Thee depend: 2I've said, Thou art my Lord, to Thee My Goodness can't Extend; 3But to the Saints, that are on Earth, And Men of Heart upright, The Excellent of heav'nly Birth, Who are my Soul's delight. 4Still shall their Sorrows multiply, Who Idol Gods adore, Their impious Off'rings I defy, Their very Names abhor. 5God is the Portion of my Cup, My Heritage, my Lot; 6Within the Lines, that shut me up, I've fair Possessions got. 7I'll bless the Lord, my Counseller, Who guides my Thoughts aright; And with my Heart, while I confer, I Knowledge gain by Night. 8The Lord before me I have set, Hence I unmov'd shall stand; That God his Care should not forget, He stays at my Right Hand. 9Therefore my Heart is glad, my Tongue Do's my great Joy attest; Also, behold, my Flesh shall strong In Hope of Glory rest. 10Lord, Thou wilt ne'er abandon me, But me, tho' dead, wilt save; Nor let thy Holy One e'er see Corruption in the Grave. 11The Path of Life he'll make me know, And loose, O Death, thy Band: Still in thy Presence Pleasures flow, Full Joys at thy right Hand. Psalm XVII. 1 The Right, Lord Righteous, hear, And hearken to my Cry, That issues from a Heart sincere, And Lips not us'd to lye. 2Let Sentence on my Cause, Lord, be pronounc'd by Thee, Decide, by just and equal Laws, Between my Foe and me. 3Lord, Thou my Heart hast try'd, Prov'd me by Night within, But find'st no Guile, I fix'd abide To keep my Mouth from Sin. 4For what concerns the Deeds, And Ways of human Kind; By Light, that from thy Word proceeds, I've wicked Paths declin'd. 5Uphold my Footsteps, Lord, Firm in thy Sacred Way, So shall I guided by thy Word Not slip, nor go astray. 6I still to Thee repair, For Thou wilt hear my Cry; Incline thine Ear, and with my Pray'r O Gracious God comply. 7Be kind, Thou who dost save The Just by thy right Hand, Who trusting in Thee Succour crave, When Foes invade their Land. Part II. 8Guard me, as Thou would'st keep The Apple of thine Eye, Beneath thy shadowy Wings I'll creep, And safe from Danger ly; 9From Foes, who me oppress, Who deadly Malice bear, And round beset me to distress, And catch me in their Snare. 10In their own Fat, behold, They are enclos'd around; Their Mouths, while they grow proud and bold, With boastful Speech abound. 11They compass me about, Beset me ev'ry Way, Couching they wait to spy me out, And seize me as their Prey. 12Like as a Lyon strong, With rav'ning Hunger bit, Or as it were a Lyon young, That do's in Secret sit. 13Rise, disappoint him, Lord, And cast him to the Ground; Nor let the Proud, thy vengeful Sword, My Soul in Wrath confound. 14These, whom as chast'ning Rods, Thy Pleasure is to use, For Pomp and Pow'r rever'd as Gods, On Earth their Portion chuse. With Issue they are blest, With Ease and Plenty cloy'd; And to their Sons, what they Possest, They leave to be enjoy'd. 15I Views of thy blest Face In Righteousness shall take, Pleas'd when I break from Death's Embrace, And in thy Likeness wake. Psalm XVIII. 1 I'll love the Lord, my Fort and Shield, 2My God, my Strength, my Mountain high The Horn that do's Salvation yield, The Tow'r to which pursu'd I fly. 3To Great Jehovah I will raise My earnest Voice in solemn Pray'r, To him who worthy is of Praise, So my Defence shall be his Care. 4Dangers and num'rous Troubles joyn'd, Threat'ning my Life around me stood, And godless Multitudes combin'd Assail'd me, like a roaring Flood. 5Hell's Sorrows, and thy cruel Snares, O Death, their Train around me drew, Ready to seize me unawares, 'Ere I the threatning Danger knew. 6Distress'd I call'd upon the Lord, And cry'd devoutly to my God, He did a gracious Ear afford, And heard my Voice from his Abode. Part II. 7The Earth's low Caves Distraction fills, Th' Affright its trembling Pillars took, And the Foundations of the Hills, For God was wroth, with Terrour shook. 8Outragious Breath and Clouds of Smoke From his hot Nostrils did aspire, And from his Mouth in Vengeance broke Fierce Tempests of consuming Fire. 9By his resistless Strength he bent The starry Heav'ns, stretch'd forth on High, And then came down Magnificent, Darkness beneath his Feet did ly. 10He on his flaming Cherubs train'd, His swift immortal Chariots, rode, And on their active Wings sustain'd From Heav'n came flying all abroad. 11Black Meteors form'd his secret Throne, And Clouds his high Pavilion were; The Veil around his Glory thrown Were gloomy Vapours of the Air. 12Before the Brightness of his Face Mists and thick Darkness did retire; And broken Clouds fell from their Place In show'rs of Hail and Storms of Fire. 13God with his Voice against my Foe Thunder'd his Terrours from the Sky; 14In Wrath did Darts destructive throw, And bade his conq'ring Lightnings fly. 15Then watry Depths discov'rd were, The World's Foundations lay in View, Ev'n by a Frown, or Blast of Air, The Breath that from thy Nostrils flew. Part III. 16The Lord did Help for me command From Heav'n above, his Throne of Bliss; He took and drew me by his Hand From the great Waters deep Abyss. 17I, by his mighty Aid, prevail'd O'er my Opposer's Pow'r and Pride, Who me with deadly Hate assail'd, And on superiour Strength rely'd. 18When I with Trouble was opprest, They had surpriz'd me unawares, Had not the Lord, on whom I rest, Sustain'd and sav'd me from their Snares. 19He from Confinement did discharge His Servant, by his matchless Might, And my abiding Place enlarge, Because he took in me Delight. 20Justly did I my self demean, Hence the just God rewarded me, And, as my Hands from Guile were clean, His righteous Judgment set me free. 21I never, from an evil Heart, Thy sacred Ways, O Lord, declin'd; Nor from my God did e'er depart, Determin'd by a Wicked Mind. 22For all his Laws were in my Sight, Still I his Statutes had in View; 23I also with him was upright, And did my tempting Sin subdue. 24By Rules of Equity and Right The Righteous God rewarded me, My Hands were clean before his Sight, His Sentence therefore set me free. Part IV. 25Thou'lt gracious to the Gracious be, And just to them who Justice love; 26Wilt pure to Men of Purity, And froward to the Froward prove. 27For Thou wilt save th' afflicted Poor, But wilt the lofty Looks debase. 28Thou to my Lamp wilt Light restore, My God will hence my Darkness chase. 29By Thee, with dauntless Courage fir'd, Embattled Troops I've broken thro', And, by the Lord my God inspir'd, Leap'd o'er the Fences of my Foe. 30Thy Ways, O Lord, when most obscure And hard, are perfect, wise and just. Thy Words the strictest Test endure, Thou Shield of all, who in Thee trust. 31The Lord's our God, and He alone Able and ready to protect; What other God, what Rock is known, To which our Flight we may direct? 32God girds me for the Field with Might, And Courage thro' my Soul displays; And that I still may walk upright, He opens and makes plain my Ways. 33He makes my Feet the Hind's outvy, To fly from Danger, when distrest; And on my Places strong and high He sets me, where I safely rest. 34While He is pleas'd my Heart to warm, I Skill acquire, and Vigour feel; And while his Strength employs my Arm, I bend and break a Bow of Steel. Part V. 35My Shield, thou hast protected me, And held me up by thy Right-Hand; And by thy gracious Clemency Hast rais'd me up to great Command. 36At length my Steps thou hast enlarg'd, To narrow Room confin'd before; My Feet from doubtful Ways discharg'd, That they did slip, and err no more. 37I did the haughty Foe defeat, And in Pursuit the Sword I cloy'd, Nor gave the Signal for Retreat, 'Till in their Flight they were destroy'd. 38They have receiv'd so deep a Wound, They'll rise no more, no more make head; While fal'n in heaps they spread the Ground, I Victor on the Vanquish'd tread. 39For Thou hast girded me with Might, That I my Rivals might oppose, And conquer in successful Fight Those, who in Arms against me rose. 40Thou hast compell'd my Foes to yield Their Necks to my prevailing Sword, That I victorious in the Field Might cut them off, who me abhor'd. 41My Foes against me, beg'd for Aid, They cry'd, but no Salvation got, Importunate they often pray'd To God most High, who answer'd not. 42I beat their Troops, that flew as fleet As Dust by Winds driv'n o'er the Plain, And as on Dirt, that spreads the Street, I trod in Triumph o'er the Slain. Part VI. 43Rescu'd by Thee, from Foes at home, O'er neighb'ring Lands I've sov'reign Sway; I'm of the Heathen Head become, And Realms unknown shall me obey. 44Soon as my Name to them is known, With my Commands they will comply; Strangers, in dread of my Renown, Will at my Feet submissive ly. 45Nations remote and haughty Pow'rs Shall find their Strength apace decay; Shall leave their Holds and strongest Tow'rs, And trembling, my Protection pray. 46Let the Lord live! my Rock be blest! And high exalted be his Name! Let God, my Saviour, be possest Of Glory, Pow'r, and boundless Fame! 47It is the Mighty God, that shows Avenging Justice in my Cause, Who by his Pow'r subdues my Foes, And makes them subject to my Laws. 48Thou sav'st me from my Enemies, Thou set'st me free, Lord, my Defence, From them, who arm'd against me rise, And from the Man of Violence. 49Therefore Thanksgivings I'll address, O Lord, to thy exalted Throne; Thee mid'st the Heathen I'll confess, And make abroad thy Praises known. 50He great Deliv'rance to his King Affords, and do's restore his Peace, Whence Blessings will to David spring, And to his Seed, that shall not cease. Psalm XIX. 1 The Heav'ns, by God stretch'd forth on High, His Majesty express; The Firmament and starry Sky His pow'rful Hand confess. 2See, in Succession ev'ry Day, And each returning Night, The Goodness of the Lord display, And testify his Might. 3Is there a Speech or Language found Thro' all the Earth's wide Face, Where, tho' this Voice is void of Sound, They can't its Meaning trace? 4This plainly Men read in the Lines On Nature's Visage writ, Here do's the Sun, that brightly shines, In his Pavilion sit. 5Which, as a Bridegroom richly drest Joyful to run his Course, Comes from his Chambers in the East, With a strong Gyant's Force. 6Then rushing thro' the heav'nly Fields He seeks his western Seat, And in his circling Passage yields To all Things fruitful Heat. Part II. 7But what his Works can't fully reach, God's Law reveal'd supplies; This will the Soul convert and teach, And make the Simple wise. 8The Statutes of the Lord are right, And fill with Joy the Heart; His Judgments pure, and heav'nly Light, To willing Minds impart. 9The Fear of God is most refin'd, And shall for ever last; Still has he equal Laws enjoyn'd, And righteous Judgments past. 10Richer they are than golden Oar, From Ophir's purest Vein, And sweeter than the sweetest Store, That Honey-combs contain. 11By them admonish'd I avoid The Snares that me surround: The Mind in keeping them employ'd With great Rewards is crown'd. 12Lord, all thy Laws are pure and good, But I my Errors own: Who all his Faults has understood? Cleanse me from Sins unknown. 13As Pardon for past Guilt I crave, From future me restrain; From heinous Sins thy Servant save, Nor let them o'er me reign. So held from each presumptuous Fault, I'll to thy Laws adhere; And shall by God be righteous thought, Not perfect, but sincere. 14Let pious Thoughts possess my Mind, My Words With Truth accord; They'll then with Thee Acceptance find, My Strength and Saviour, Lord! Another Metre. 1 The Heav'ns by God stretch'd forth on High, His Glorious Majesty express; The Firmament and starry Sky, God's handy Work, his Pow'r confess. 2The Order, and successive Course Of still returning Night and Day, This sacred Truth do's more enforce, And more th' Almighty's Fame display. 3Is there a Tongue or Nation found, Tho' rude of Life and slow of Sense, To which these Works do not expound Their Maker's vast Omnipotence? 4This in their Lines is plainly read, Which shine on Nature's Visage bright; Here do's the Sun illustrious spread Jehovah's Praises with his Light. 5Which, as a Bridegroom richly drest, Advances with a cheerful Face, And leaves his Chambers in the East, Pleas'd, as a Gyant, with his Race. 6Then rushing thro' th' unfolded Gates Springs to the West with mighty Force; And passing thro' the heav'nly Heights Gives Heat to all Things in his Course. Part II. 7But what his Works can't fully reach, The Law of God reveal'd supplies, This will the Soul convert and teach, And make the willing Learner wise. 8The Statutes of the Lord are right, And fill the Heart with Joy and Love; His Judgments pure, and with their Light They still th' attentive Mind improve. 9The Fear of God is most refin'd, Clean, and from hurtful Mixture free; His Precepts will for ever bind, Nor do's he Falsehood e'er decree. 10Richer they are than golden Oar, That comes from Ophir's purest Vein, And sweeter than the sweetest Store, That Canaan's Honey-combs contain. 11By them admonish'd I avoid The Snares that compass me around, The Mind in keeping them employ'd With great Rewards is surely crown'd. 12Lord, all thy Laws are pure and good, But I my Faults and Follies own; Who has his Errors understood? O, cleanse me from my Sins unknown! 13As I for past Forgiveness crave, Let Grace from future Guilt restrain; From heinous Sins thy Servant save, And let them not Dominion gain. So held from each presumptuous Fault, To thy just Laws I will adhere; And shall by God be righteous thought, And, tho' not perfect, yet sincere. 14Let pious Thoughts possess my Mind, And let my Words with Truth accord, They'll then with Thee Acceptance find, My God, my Strength, my Saviour Lord! Psalm XX. 1 The Lord thy Supplication's Voice In the sad Day of Trouble hear; The God, that made our Tribes his Choice, Be to defend Thee always near: 2Send Succours from the Sanctuary, And out of Zion Thee protect; 3Remember thy Oblations free, Nor thy burnt Sacrifice reject. 4According to thy Heart's Desire, Give Thee in all thy Ways Success; With wise Advice thy Mind inspire, And all thy Undertakings bless. 5In thy Salvation we'll rejoyce, And in God's Name our Banners rear; And may the Lord well pleas'd, the Voice Of thy devout Petition hear. 6That to his King the Lord has giv'n Deliv'rance, now I understand; To him he'll sure reach forth from Heav'n The saving Strength of his Right Hand. 7Some in their Troops of Horse confide, And in their num'rous Chariots some; But on our God have we rely'd, And in his Name have overcome. 8Their Warriours are discomfited, Fal'n are their boasted Strength and Pride: We keep our Ground, while they are fled, And Victors on the Field abide. 9O Lord, our God, to save the King Employ thy providential Care; To him Divine Assistance bring, And, when we call, receive our Pray'r. Psalm XXI. 1 Thy Strength and Succour will afford Joy to the King, thy Choice; And, O, in thy Salvation, Lord, How greatly he'll rejoyce? 2His Heart's Desire thou did'st allow, Nor did'st his Pray'r withhold; 3An unsought Blessing on his Brow Thou set'st, a Crown of Gold. 4He ask'd for Life, and from the Foe Thou did'st his Life defend; And Length of Days, thou did'st bestow, And Years, that never end. 5His Fame, by thy Salvation rais'd, Spreads thro' the Realms around, For high Endowments he is prais'd, And with Dominion crown'd. 6He is by thy peculiar Grace A Man of Blessings made, Cheer'd with the Brightness of thy Face, His Joys shall never fade. Part II. 7The King on God his Strength relies, Who rais'd him to the Crown; And by him fix'd all Pow'r defies Employ'd to pull him down. 8And thy avenging Hand shall find Those, who against thee rise, Thy Right-Hand shall the Rebels find, Who hate Thee and despise. 9God shall th' Unjust, as sapless Wood, To a hot Oven doom, In Wrath, for Fire shall make them Food, Where they'll in Flames consume. 10Thou shalt destroy their hateful Fruit, Their Land and Seats efface, And wholly ruin Branch and Root, Them and their wicked Race. 11Against Thee and thy People they Conceiv'd and harbour'd Ill, And did Designs pernicious lay, Yet ne'er perform'd their Will. 12Therefore thou'lt make their Troops from Fight Soon turn their Backs in Fear, Against them when thy Arrows bright Upon thy Strings appear. 13Assert thy Strength, thy Glory raise, And make thy Wonders known; So we'll take Pleasure in thy Praise, In Songs thy Triumph own. Psalm XXII. 1 My God, my God, O why do'st thou Let me forsaken ly? Why no Relief to me allow, Deaf to my roaring Cry? 2Lord, tho' I call to Thee by Day, Thou hear'st not my Request; By Night I likewise earnest Pray, And never silent rest. 3But Thou, as Holy, art ador'd, Tho' I no Pity raise, O Thou, who art the rightful Lord Of Israel's sacred Praise! 4Our Fathers thy Protection crav'd, And sure Deliv'rance gain'd; 5To thee they cry'd and still were sav'd, And not in Shame complain'd. 6But I'm a Worm, and not a Man, A Wretch as nothing priz'd; When Chiefs in slander led the Van, The People me despis'd. 7Spectators in a scoffing Way The Lip and Head do move; 8Let God, his Trust, save him, say they, If God did him approve. Part II. 9God from the Womb has set me free, My Hope ev'n from the Breast, 10I at my Birth was cast on Thee, Thou art my God and Rest. 11O Lord, far from me do not stand, When great Distress is near; Lord, help, what other helping Hand To save me can appear? 12My Foes, like Bulls of Bashan, lye Around me ev'ry Way; 13On me with open Mouths they fly, Like Lyons on their Prey. 14Like Water spilt my Force is spent, My Bones asunder go, My Heart do's like soft Wax relent, And midst my Bowels flow. 15As a dry'd Potsherd look on me, Parch'd are my Tongue and Throat: Lord, to the Dust of Death by Thee Afflicted I am brought. 16Dogs compass'd me, me Men perverse Enclos'd, with threat'ning Bands; Th' Assembly of th' Unjust did pierce, In rage, my Feet and Hands. 17My starting Bones may all be told, They look'd and me did view, 18They shar'd my Garments, and, behold, Lots on my Coat they threw. Part III. 19Keep not at Distance from me, Lord, To help me do not fail; 20Protect my Darling from the Sword, Nor let the Dog prevail. 21O from the rav'ning Lyon fear'd Let me Salvation see, And from the Unicorn: I'm heard, Thou wilt deliver me. 22Then to my Brethren I'll relate Thy Deeds of high Renown, And in the Congregation wait Thy Name with Praise to crown. 23All you, to whom our God is dear, His Praise aloud proclaim; Ye chosen Seed of Jacob fear, And glorify his Name. 24For he th' Afflicted did not scorn, Nor e'er the Poor despise; Nor turn'd his Face from them that mourn, But heard the Suff'rer's Cries. 25I'll in the great Assembly stay To give Thee Praise sincere, My Vows before them I will pay, Who Thee, O Lord, revere. Part IV. 26The Meek shall eat till satisfy'd, His Servants God shall Praise; Comfort shall in your Heart abide, And Joy to endless Days. 27On all the Nations Light shall rise, They'll turn to Thee, O Lord; By all the Heathen Families Our God shall be ador'd. 28For to the Lord of boundless Might The Kingdom appertains; And He, by uncontested Right, Among the Heathen reigns. 29The Rich shall eat and bow down low, And they shall Worship give, Who to the Dust afflicted go, By him their Souls shall live. 30The future Times a Seed shall see, Who'll serve Him, Him alone; These shall become a Family, That He'll account his own. 31An Age shall come, when they shall rise, Who shall his Truth declare, And tell to Men unborn how Wise, How Just his Counsels were. Psalm XXIII. 1 God is my Shepherd, can I Want? 2He feeds me in delightful Meads; Do's for my Rest green Pastures grant, And me to gentle Waters leads. 3'Tis He restores my sinking Soul, And for the Glory of his Name, His Counsels so my Feet controul, That righteous Paths I make my Aim. 4When I approach Death's silent Court, To give me Aid He still is near; Thy Rod and Staff are my Support, They comfort me, and ease my Fear. 5A plenteous Table thou hast spread For me before my envious Foe, And pour'd rich Oynments on my Head, And made my Cup to overflow. 6Surely thy Mercy, often try'd, Shall all my future Life attend; I'll in thy sacred House abide, 'Till my appointed Days shall end. Another Metre. 1 God is my Shepherd, can I want? 2He feeds me in the Meads; Do's for my Rest green Pastures grant, And to still Waters leads. 3Tis He restores my sinking Soul, And for his Glory's Sake, His Counsels so my Feet controul, That righteous Ways they take. 4Tho' I approach Death's silent Court, To help me He is near; Thy Rod and Staff are my Support, And ease me of my Fear. 5A plenteous Table Thou hast spread For me, before the Foe, And pour'd rich Oynments on my Head, And made my Cup o'erflow. 6Surely thy Mercy, often try'd, Shall all my Life attend, And in thy House will I abide, 'Till my set Days shall end. Psalm XXIV. 1 The Earth, and what the Earth contains, Lord, thy Possessions are; The World, which thy Right-Hand sustains, Is Thine, and all Things there. 2For He, by his Almighty Hand, Did found it on the Seas; He o'er the Floods has rais'd the Land, And settled it in Peace. 3Who shall thy sacred Hill ascend, O God of Jacob's Race? Who shall be favour'd to attend, Lord, in thy Holy Place? 4He who is upright, and can say, My Hands and Heart are pure, Did ne'er Designs deceitful lay, Nor ever falsely swore: 5On him the Lord, his Hope and Trust, The Blessing will bestow, The God of his Salvation just, Shall Mercy to him show. 6This is the Righteous, happy Race, By whom He is ador'd, That seek with Diligence thy Face, O Jacob's God and Lord! 7Ye Gates with Heads uplifted stand, Immortal Doors divide, The King of Glory is at hand, He'll come and here reside. 8Who is this King of Glory? He The Lord for Strength renown'd; Mighty in War, with Victory In all his Battles crown'd. 9Ye Gates with Heads uplifted stand, Immortal Doors divide, The King of Glory is at hand, He'll come and here reside. 10Who is this King of Glory? He The Lord of Hosts most High. He is the King of Glory, See, His Pomp advances nigh. Another Metre. 11 The Earth, and what the Earth contains O Lord, thy just Possessions are, The World, which thy Right Hand sustains, Is shine, and all the Dwellers there. 2For He, by his Almighty Hand, Has founded it upon the Seas; He o'er the Floods has rais'd the Land, And settled it in lasting Peace. 3Who shall the sacred Hill ascend, Where God by Jacob is ador'd? Who in his holy Place attend, And worship there before the Lord? 4He who is upright, and can say, My Hands are clean, and pure my Heart, Do's no Designs deceitful lay, Nor perjur'd act an impious Part. 5Unnumber'd Blessings he receives Assur'd by Promise to the Just; The God of their Salvation leaves None, who his Truth and Goodness trust. 6This is the certain, worthy Race Of Men, for serving God renown'd, Of Men, who seek th' Almighty's Face, In Jacob, where he's only found. 7Lift up, ye lofty Gates, your Heads, Ye Doors Immortal open fly, The King of Glory comes, he treads Majestick, see, his Pomp is nigh. 8Who is this King of Glory? He, The Lord rever'd for Strength and Might; Who still is crown'd with Victory, And puts his haughty Foes to flight. 9Lift up, ye lofty Gates your Heads, Ye Doors Immortal open fly, The King of Glory comes, he treads Majestick, see, his Pomp is nigh. 10Who is this King of Glory, tell, The Lord of Hosts, who Conquest gains, Who do's in Fame and Pow'r excel, This Lord the King of Glory reigns. Psalm XXV. 1 I lift to Thee my Soul, My God, I trust in Thee; 2Save me, lest Foes without controul, Should triumph over me. 3Let none that wait on Thee, Dejected Minds express; But let them all Confusion see, Who without Cause transgress. 4Thy Ways before my Sight, I pray thee open lay, And Lord, by thy instructive Light, Thy holy Paths display. 5Be in thy Truth my Guide, Teach me to know thy Way; In God my Saviour I confide, And seek him all the Day. 6Think on thy Tenderness, And Favours manifold; Thy Mercies, Lord, to me express, For they have been of Old. 7Do not in Wrath awake My Sins of Youth to see, In Kindness for thy Goodness Sake, O Lord, remember me. 8The Lord most Good and Just Will give to Sinners Light; 9The Meek shall him their Leader trust, To guide their Steps aright. 10O Lord, thy Ways we grant, Are righteous, wise and kind, To those, who keep thy Covenant, And Testimonies mind. Part II. 11My great Offence forget, Lord, for thy Mercy's Sake; 12Before thy Servants thou wilt set What Paths they ought to take. 13At Ease their Soul shall dwell, Their Seed the Earth shall own; 14He'll to the Just his Counsels tell, His Covenant make known. 15My Eyes upon the Lord, My Trust, are ever set: For he will timely help afford, And free me from the Net. 16Turn thee, O Lord, to me, Thy Mercy I implore; My Grief and great Affliction see, I'm desolate and poor. 17The Troubles of my Heart Increase, and heavy grow; In Pity, Lord, asswage the Smart, And bring me out of Woe. 18Thy Eye upon me cast, Regard my Grief and Pain; And, O, let my Transgressions past Forgiveness, Lord, obtain. 19Observe my num'rous Foes, Who bear me deadly Spite; 20Keep me from Shame, for I repose My Trust in thee, my Might. 21On Thee I always wait, Save me in Heart sincere; 22At least recover Jacob's State, The Tribes, who Thee revere. Psalm XXVI. 1 I've walk'd in my Integrity, To judge me, Lord, preside, Still I have plac'd my Trust in Thee, And therefore shall not slide. 2Examine, Lord, and prove me, try My Reins, and search my Heart; 3I set thy Love before mine Eye, Nor from thy Truth depart. 4I with vain Persons have not sate, Nor with Dissemblers went; 5Th' Assemblies of th' Unjust I hate, Nor wicked Herds frequent. 6In Innocence I'll wash my Hands, So with thy Favour crown'd, Thy Altar, as thy Law commands, With Off'rings I'll surround. 7That I thy wond'rous Works may tell, And thank Thee with my Voice, 8The House, in which thy Glories dwell, I lov'd, and made my Choice. 9Let not the Sinner's Lot accurst My Soul, O Lord, attend; Nor like their Lives, for Blood that thirst, Let mine in Terrour end. 10Who Mischief still devise or do, And ne'er from Bribes were free: 11But as for me, I'll Truth pursue, In Mercy rescue me. 12My Foot, tho' Foes obstruct my Ways, Stands firm on even Ground; Lord, I will make with thy loud Praise The Congregation sound. Psalm XXVII. 1 O Lord, Thou art my saving Light, Why should I be dismay'd? The Lord defends me with his Might, Of whom am I afraid? 2When evil Men against me rose, My Flesh in rage to tear, In their Attempt my stumbling Foes Fell by a just Despair. 3Against me tho' an Host sit down, I fearless would abide; Should raging War against me rise, I would in this confide: 4One Thing Iv'e ask'd, and shall pursue, Still in God's House to stay, That I his Beauties still may view, And in his Temple pray. 5In his Pavilion I'll abide Of evil Days the Shock; Me in his secret Place he'll hide, And set me on a Rock. 6And now, above my Foes around, The Lord my Head will raise; His Tent with Off'rings shall abound, I'll sing, I'll sing his Praise. Part II. 7Lord, to the Pray'r incline thy Ear, Which I address to Thee; Shew me thy Loving Kindness, hear My Voice, and answer me. 8When Thou thy Will did'st thus impart, Seek ye my Face with speed, This in my Heart I weigh'd, my Heart To seek thy Face agreed. 9Hide not thy Face, nor of its Light In Anger me bereave: Thou hast upheld me, do not slight, Nor me, my Saviour, leave. 10Tho' me my Father should forsake, My Mother me remove, God would their naked Outcast take, And a kind Father prove. 11Teach me thy Ways, and lead my Feet In Paths direct and plain, That I may no Reproaches meet, Or envious Mens Disdain 12Lord, to the Will of Enemies Do not deliver me, False Witnesses against me rise, And Sons of Cruelty. 13Down I had sunk, with Sorrow bent, But for this firm Belief, That God before my Days were spent, Would ease my Weight of Grief. 14Wait on the Lord, and for Redress With patient Courage stay; He'll strengthen thee in thy Distress, Wait on the Lord; and pray. Psalm XXVIII. 1 Lord, I'll to Thee my Rock complain, A gracious Answer send; If not, I must like them remain, Who to the Pit descend. 2When my Complaints to Thee I tell, My Supplications hear, When to thy Holy Oracle, I lift my Hands in Pray'r. 3Lord, take me not away with those, Who ne'er from Mischief cease, Who, while their Heart with Malice glows, Speak to their Neighbour Peace. 4Give them what Sins Demerit claims, Let not their Crimes be spar'd; Condemn them for their wicked Aims, And their ill Deeds reward. 5Since they Jehovah's Wonders slight, His Work's of high Renown, He to destroy them will delight, Not build, but pull them down. 6Bless'd be the Lord, who heard my Voice, He is my Buckler strong, 7My Trust and Help, hence I'll rejoyce, And praise Him with my Song. 8His Strength his People will advance, He's to his King a Fort, 9Lord, bless thy own Inheritance, Still feed them and support. Psalm XXIX. 1 Give to the Lord, O give Renown, And Strength, ye mighty Race; 2Do Honour to his Name, bow down Within his Holy Place. 3The Lord's loud Voice rings thro' the Stores Of watry Clouds and Rain; The God of Glory's Thunder roars Above the troubled Main. 4Vast Pow'r thy Voice, Jehovah, speaks, Thy Glory thus is shown: 5The Lord's dread Voice high Cedar breaks, Thy Cedars, Lebanon. 6Like Calves he also makes them fly, And skip by Tempests born, Fair Lebanon and Sirion High, Like a young Unicorn. 7The Lord's dread Voice an opening makes, Whence Lightning's Flames are cast: 8The Lord's dread Voice the desart Shakes, Kadesh, thy Desart vast. 9His Voice do's Hinds to calve compel, And makes the Forest bare; All in his House his Wonders tell, His Glory all declare. 10He at the Flood in Judgment sate, And sits for ever King, 11The Lord will strengthen Israel's State, Peace to his People bring. Another Metre. 1 Give to the Lord, O give Renown, Glory and Strength ye mighty Race; 2The Lord's great Name with Honour crown, And Worship in his Holy Place. 3The Lord's loud Voice rings on the Stores Of Waters, which the Sky contain: The God of Glory's Thunder roars Above the Billows of the Main. 4The Lord's dread Voice Dominion speaks, His Majesty by this is shown. 5The Lord's dread Voice high Cedars breaks, Cedars, the Pride of Lebanon. 6Like Calves He also makes them fly, And skip about by Tempests born, Fair Lebanon and Sirion high, Like a young active Unicorn. 7The Lord's dread Voice an opening makes, From which the Lightning's Flames are cast. 8The Lord's dread Voice the Desart shakes, Thy Desart, Kadesh, dry and vast. 9The Lord's dread Voice do's Hinds compel To calve, and makes the Forrest bare; With Awe Men in his Temple tell These Wonders, and his Pow'r declare. 10He at the Flood in Judgment sate And He shall sit for ever King; 11The Lord shall strengthen Israel's State; And to his People Peace shall bring. Psalm XXX. 1 Since Thou hast rais'd me, with my Voice, Lord, I'll exalt thy Name; Thou hast not made my Foes rejoice, Nor cover'd me with Shame. 2Distress'd to Thee, I cry'd, O Lord, Deliv'rance let me gain; For Thou my Vigour hast restor'd, And eas'd my raging Pain. 3Thou gracious Lord, did'st me revive, And bring me from the Grave: Thou did'st preserve my Soul alive, And from Destruction save. 4Thanks to the Lord, ye Saints express, And call his Love to Mind; In Songs extol the Holiness, Which in his Ways you find. 5His Frowns are in a Moment past, Life from his Favour springs; Sad Weeping for a Night may last, But Joys the Morning brings. 6I said, in my Prosperity Puff'd up and growing Vain, No Revolution shall I see, Unmov'd I shall remain. 7Thy Favour, Lord, hath fix'd my Throne; When Thou thy Face did'st hide, Rob'd of its Light, I made my Moan, And to th' Almighty cry'd; 8, 9To Thee my Death no Gain can bring, When to the Grave I go, Shall there the Dust thy Praises Sing? Shall it thy Counsels show? 10Lord gracious, hear me, and express The Marks of pitying Love: O, help me in my great Distress, My Pain and Grief remove. 11I'm heard; my Sighs to Mirth are turn'd, My Heart no more is Sad: Tho' drest in Sackcloth long I mourn'd, I now in Joy am clad: 12That so my grateful Tongue may sing Thy Praises, whil'st I live; Aloud to Thee, O God my King, I'll Thanks for ever give. Psalm XXXI. 1 Thou art my Trust in my Distress, From Shame deliver me: Jehovah, in thy Righteousness, From Trouble set me free. 2Bow down thine Ear, my Cause espouse, And save me, Lord, with Speed: Be Thou my Rock of Strength, an House For Safety, which I need. 3In Thee, my Rock, I still confide, I Thee my Fortress make; Thou, Lord, wilt me direct and guide For thy own Glory's Sake. 4To free me from their secret Net, Lord, make a kind Effort, And let their Toyl in vain be set, For Thou art my Support. 5Into thy Hand, Lord gracious, See, My Spirit I commend; O Lord, thou God of Truth, to me Thou did'st Redemption send. 6Still did I hate them and despise, Who to false Gods apply, And worship lying Vanities, But I on Thee rely. Part II. 7Joy in thy Mercy, which I own, And Gladness I'll express; For Thou hast me in Trouble known, And sav'd me in Distress. 8He has not left me in their Hands, But me from Foes discharg'd; He sav'd my Life from threat'ning Bands, My streighten'd Feet inlarg'd. 9To me distress'd, Lord, Mercy show; My Eyes are Grief's Repast; My Soul is overwhelm'd with Woe, With Pain my Bowels waste. 10My Life in Groans and Sighs is spent, My troubled Spirits fail: My Bones are dry'd, my Nerves unbent, Whilst I my Sins bewail. 11By Foes and Neighbours I was scorn'd, Fear my Acquaintance seiz'd; Those whom I met, of Danger warn'd, Fled at my Sight displeas'd. 12I like the Dead am no Man's Care, But wholly out of Mind; And as the Potter's broken Ware, Scorn and Dishonour find. 13By Slanders they express their Hate, Fears ev'ry way invade; Designs, while they in Counsel sate, Against my Life they laid. Part III. 14But Trust in Thee Submission bred, Ev'n when I felt thy Rod, And conscious of thy Truth I said, O Lord, Thou art my God. 15My number'd Times are in thy Hand; Me from my Foes defend, The hateful persecuting Band, Who Violence intend. 16Lord, in Compassion, make thy Face On me thy Servant shine; To save me from the wicked Race, Let Mercy Thee incline. 17Lord, let me not be cloath'd with Shame, Whose Cries thy Pity crave, Confound th' Unjust, who hate thy Name, And doom them to the Grave. 18Let the false Lips, that utter Lies, And Insolent become, That wound the Just with Calumnies, Be struck for ever Dumb. Part IV. 19Thy Goodness, Lord, surpasses Thought, Stor'd safely for the Just, Or for their Sakes in Publick wrought, Who place in Thee their Trust. 20Thou shalt in Secret from the Pride Of Man defend their Life; And them in thy Pavilion hide, From Tongues engag'd in Strife. 21Bless'd be the Lord, for he has shown He's wond'rous Good and Kind; He succour'd me, when in a Town Of strong Defence confin'd. 22Rush in my hasty Flight I cry'd, I'm cut off from thy Care, Yee to my Voice the Lord reply'd, And heard my earnest Pray'r. 23O love the Lord, all ye his Saints, For he the Faithful guards; The Proud, who cause their sad Complaints, He plenteously rewards. 24Confirm'd, and full of Courage be, Establish'd be your Heart, Who wait in Hope for God, and He Will Strength to you impart. Psalm XXXII. 1 Blest Man! whose Errours God forgives, And covers o'er his Sin, 2Who in no Guilt unpardon'd lives, Nor hides Deceit within. 3When, silent, I my Faults supprest, My Bones consum'd away; Old they became thro' Want of Rest, And Roaring all the Day. 4For Day and Night thy heavy Hand Did Strokes severe repeat; I lost all Moisture, like the Land Parch'd by the Summer's Heat. 5I own'd my Sin, my Guilt abhor'd, My Trespass I confest, Nor hid my Errours from the Lord, Whose Pardon me releast. 6This, in the Times of finding Thee, Each godly Man shall crave; No swelling Flood of Misery Shall reach him with its Wave. 7Thou the safe Place, in which I hide, From Streights shalt rescue me, And make me Cause on ev'ry Side For Songs of Triumph see. 8O Man, my Words shall make thee wise, And teach thy Feet their Way. I'll guide thee with my watchful Eye; Lest thou should'st go astray. 9Resemble not the Horse and Mule, That Reason cannot hear, Whose Mouths a Bit and Bridle rule To bring them to thee near. 10Sorrows and Trouble shall confound God's wicked Enemies, But Mercy shall the Man surround, Who on the Lord relies. 11Ye Sons of Righteousness be glad, And in the Lord rejoice, No more, ye upright Hearts, be sad, But shout with joyful Voice. Psalm XXXIII. 1 O, In the Lord, your Hope and Trust, Ye Righteous, still rejoice; It well becomes the Pure and Just To lift in Praise their Voice. 2To Him, with Harps be Praises sent, Sing with the Psaltery, And to the Ten-string'd Instrument Your tuneful Hand apply. 3Sing to the Lord a Song that's new, With Noise triumphant play; 4For the Lord's Word is right and true, And faithful is his Way. 5He do's in Righteousness delight, Just Judgments please his Will: He with his Goodness infinite Do's all the Nations fill. 6The Heav'ns at His resistless Word, And all their Hosts were made; Pow'r from thy Mouth went forth, O Lord, And they thy Breath obey'd. 7In Heaps He gathers by his Hand The Waters of the Sea; And the deep Gulphs his high Command Do's in a Store-house lay. 8Let all the Tribes of human Race The Lord their Maker fear, All Tongues, that spread the Earth's wide Face, This awful Lord revere. 9For He, th' Almighty, spake, and See, 'Twas done at his Command: The spacious World began to be, And did unshaken stand. 10The Lord the Counsel undermines, Which heathen Nations take; And He the People's proud Designs, Do's unsuccessful make. 11The Counsel of the Lord is sure, And stands for ever fast; And of his Heart th' Intentions pure From Age to Age shall last. Part II. 12Blest Nation, which can in the Lord, As in their God, rejoice, The People by his Hand restor'd, The Portion of his Choice. 13The Lord looks down from Heav'n, his Eyes Beholds all Adam's Race: 14He all the Nations round descries, From his high dwelling Place. 15Alike th' Almighty shapes and sways The Hearts of human Kind; He well considers all their Ways, And do's their Actions mind. 16No King is by a num'rous Host Sav'd from the threatning Foe; No Champions, who of Might can boast, To Strength their Safety owe. 17The Horse the Warriour can't ensure, He's a vain Hope in Fight; Tho' strong and swift, he can't secure In Battle nor in Flight. 18God watches those, who Him revere, And to his Mercy fly; 19To save their Soul he will be near, Lest they in Famine dy. 20Our longing Soul, Lord, waits on Thee, Thou art our Help and Shield: 21Now shall our Hearts rejoyce, that we Our Hopes did on him build. 22O Thou Jehovah ever blest! Let us thy Mercy see, As we have still for Peace and Rest Repos'd our Trust in Thee. Psalm XXXIV. 1 In ev'ry Season of my Days The Lord, my God, I'll bless; My Mouth shall never ceasing praise In grateful Strains express. 2My Soul deliver'd now from Fear, Shall glory in the Lord; The Humble shall rejoyce to hear, That I am thus restor'd. 3O, magnify the Lord with me, Let us his Fame display: 4I sought him in my Streights, and He Chac'd all my Fears away. 5To him the Righteous in Distress Did look and flow apace; He did his gracious Care express And sav'd from Shame their Face. 6This helpless Man, of me they said, His Pray'r to God rehears'd; He heard, the Troubles round him spread In Mercy he dispers'd. 7Angels that grasp immortal Arms To guard the Righteous fly, And to resist invading Harms, Encamp'd around him ly. 8Repeat your Tryals, taste and see How good you'll find the Lord; To all, who trust his Mercy, He His Blessing will afford. 9O ye, his Saints, the Almighty fear, None worship Him in vain; And few or none of Heart sincere, Of Poverty complain. 10Young Lyons often hungry roar, And seek in vain their Food; But they, who God in Truth adore, Shall Want no needful Good. Part II. 11Come, Children, my Instruction hear, And hearken to my Voice, I'll teach you how the Lord to fear, And make his Ways your Choice. 12What Man in earnest covets Life, And would good Days prolong; 13Let him preserve his Lips from Strife, And from Deceit his Tongue. 14Depart from Evil, be to all Full of good Works, and kind; If Discord happens, Peace recall, And shew a friendly Mind. 15Jehovah keeps, on all that fear His Name, a watchful Eye, And when they pray, his gracious Ear Is open to their Cry. 16The Lord against the wicked Band In Anger sets his Face, He'll cut them off, and from the Land Their vile Remembrance rase. 17The Just the Lord in Trouble seek, Their mournful Cry he hears; With tender Care he saves the Meek, And eases all their Fears: 18The Lord is nigh, to succour those, Who by Contrition bleed: 19The Righteous is involv'd in Woes, But by the Lord is freed. 20The Lord do's keep the Bones, that bear His Body, firm and sound; And guards them with such watchful Care, Not one is broken found. 21Destructive Pains and Grief of Mind The Wicked shall endure, And they, that hate the Just, shall find Their Condemnation sure. 22The Lord redeems the Souls of those, Who just and upright are; None, who their Trust in Him repose, Shall desolate despair. Psalm XXXV. 1 My Cause with my Opposers, Lord, Who fight against me, plead: 2Lift up thy Buckler, and afford Thy Servant timely Aid. 3Draw forth, and shake thy dreadful Spear, Against them stop the Way; Lord, to my Soul, opprest with Fear, I'm thy Salvation, say. 4Do Thou confound and put to Shame Those, who my Life pursue; And all, who at my Ruin aim, Do Thou in Wrath subdue. 5Like empty Chaff, that thro' the Sky The Wind and Tempest Chace, Let them before thy Angel fly, And run from Place to Place. 6Let them thro' dark and slipp'ry Ways Go on in Pain and Fear, While thy destructive Angel slays, And persecutes their Reer. 7For causeless they have laid their Snares, And form'd their Pit and Net; 8Let Ruin seize them, unawares Caught in the Toyl they set. 9Then I to Heav'n will raise my Voice, And grateful Thanks express; In thy Salvation I'll rejoice, And my Deliv'rer bless. 10My Bones shall say, now pain'd no more, Who gains, like God, Applause? He rescues from the Strong the Poor, And breaks the Spoiler's Jaws. Part II. 11False Witnesses against me rose, My Innocence opprest, And to my Charge my faithless Foes, Laid Crimes, that I detest. 12Tho' I had show'd to them Goodwill, When favour'd, and in Pow'r, Yet they rewarded Good with Ill, Would me and mine devour. 13I pray'd, when they did Sickness bear, And did in Sackcloth mourn, And to my Bosom may the Pray'r, I made for them, return. 14As to a Friend or Brother I Did Rules becoming keep, And hung my Head, as those, that sigh, And for a Mother weep. 15But they rejoyc'd at my Distress; Abjects together came, Base Men unknown did me oppress, Nor ceas'd to wound my Fame. 16As wicked Mockers, who at Feasts, To please the Vile, blaspheme, They gnash their Teeth, and of their Jests Make me the constant Theme. 17Lord, an unactive Looker on How long wilt Thou abide? O save, my God, my Only One, My Soul from Sons of Pride 18There in the great Assembly, I Thy Goodness will confess; Among much People, Lord most high, I'll Thanks to Thee address. Part III. 19Let not my Foes insult my State, My Foes tho' wrongfully, Nor those, who bear me causeless Hate, Wink mocking with the Eye. 20All healing Counsels they disclaim, And guileful Plots prepare, Against them, who make Peace, their Aim; And publick Good, their Care. 21On me with open Mouth they press'd, And thus insulting said, Our Eyes are with the Prospect bless'd, Which long our Hopes has fed. 22This Thou hast seen, All-knowing Lord, Then do not silent stand; Be not far from me, but afford Thy ready helping Hand. 23Stir up thy self, rise and awake, To judge me by thy Laws: My God, my Lord, O undertake The Tryal of my Cause. 24According to thy Righteousness, Lord, pass a right Decree, Let not my Foes their Joy express, Nor triumph over me. 25Let them not say within their Hearts, We now Success can boast; Let them not say, he by our Arts Is swallow'd up and lost. 26Let Trouble seize them and Disgrace, Who triumph in my Woes: Lord, spread Confusion o'er their Face, Who proudly me oppose. 27But let them Joy triumphant shew, That own my Righteousness, And glorify Jehovah, who Is pleas'd with my Success. 28Then shall my Tongue in Rapture speak Of all thy upright Ways, And from my Lips all Day shall break Loud Songs of grateful Praise. Psalm XXXVI. 1 When I reflect how bold and rise Ungodliness and Vice are grown, I learn from such unrighteous Life, That most the Fear of God disown. 2In his own Eyes the Wicked draws His flatt'ring Image clear and bright, Till, Lord, his Breaches of thy Laws, And hateful Crimes are brought to Light. 3Words from his Mouth of guileful Art, And vile Hypocrisie did flow, See now he acts no double Part, But do's th' Apostate open show. 4Unwearied, with deli'brate Thought, In Bed he hatching Mischief wakes; Boldly repeats his heinous Fault, Nor his unrighteous Way forsakes. 5Tho' Man is false yet God is just, His Mercy to the Heav'ns ascends; His Truth, which none deluded trust, To Heights above the Clouds extends. 6Thy Justice stands as Mountains high, Thy Judgments, as the Sea, are deep; Thy Bounty do's our Wants supply, And Man and Beast from Danger keep. Part II. 7In Goodness how dost thou excell, Most gracious God, thou King of Kings! The Sons of Men in Safety dwell, Beneath the Shadow of thy Wings. 8The Fatness, which thy House contains, Shall satisfy each craving Guest, Who'll fill abundantly his Veins, With Rivers of thy Pleasures blest. 9Because of Life the flowing Spring Is found, and only found with Thee: And in thy Light, eternal King, Immortal Glory we shall see. 10Let Mercy, Lord, on all descend, Who know Thee, and in Thee delight; Thy Justice evermore extend To all, who are in Heart upright. 11Let not the Foot of Pride prevail, Nor wicked Hands remove me, Lord: 12I'm heard, Behold, the Wicked fail, Cast down, no more to be restor'd. Another Metre. 1 Th' ungodly's Sins, which great appear, My inmost Heart apprise, That there is no religious Fear Of God before his Eyes. 2Th' Unjust in his own Fancy draws His flatt'ring Image bright; 'Till, Lord, his Breaches of thy Laws Are found a hateful Sight. 3His Mouth is full of guileful Art, Whence Speech deceitful flows; Tho' now he acts no double Part, But plain th' Apostate shows. 4In Bed with cool delib'rate Thought He hatching Mischief wakes; Boldly repeats his heinous Fault, Nor evil Ways forsakes. 5Tho' Man is false, yet God is just; Thy Mercies reach the Skies; Thy Truth, which none deluded trust, The Clouds in Height outvies. 6Thy Justice, as the Mountains steep, And lofty is confest; Thy Judgments are an Ocean deep; Thou sav'st both Man and Beast. Part II. 7In Goodness how do'st Thou excell, O Lord, Thou King of Kings! Hence, that in Safety they may dwell, Men seek thy shelt'ring Wings. 8The Fatness which thy House contains, Shall satisfy each Guest: Abundantly they'll fill their Veins, With Floods of Pleasure blest. 9Of Life the Fountain is with Thee; And in thy blissful Light, We shall immortal Glory see, Still ravish'd with thy Sight. 10Let thy unbounded Goodness flow, And constant Streams impart To all, who Thee obey and know, And are of upright Heart. 11Let not the Foot of Pride prevail, Nor Foes remove me, Lord: 12I'm heard; cast down the Wicked fail, No more to be restor'd. Psalm XXXVII. 1 Let not th' Ungodly trouble Thee, Ev'n in their happy State; Nor they that work Iniquity, Thy Envy e'er create. 2For soon cut down they shall consume, And like mown Grass be laid: Their Beauty with'ring in its Bloom, Like the green Herb, shall fade. 3Unshaken in the Lord confide, Do righteous Things and good: So shalt Thou in the Land abide, And find abundant Food. 4O! in the Lord delight, and He Shall grant thy Heart's Request: 5To Him commit thy Way, and be With all thy Wishes blest. 6Thy Faithfulness, by Him made clear, Shall shine forth, as the Light; Thy Justice spotless shall appear, And as the Noon-day bright. 7Wait on the Lord, in Patience rest; Nor let it give thee Pain, When wicked Men with Peace are blest, And all their Ends obtain. 8From Anger cease, lest Wrath beguile And tempt thee to transgress: 9For godless Men shall perish, while The Just the Earth possess. 10Soon shall the wicked Man be gone, Thou'lt seek his Place in vain: 11Mean time the Meek the Earth shall own, And Peace abundant gain. 12Th' Unjust the Just with Plots pursue, And raging gnash their Teeth: 13The Lord most High shall mock them, who Their Day is coming, see'th. Part II. 14The Proud have drawn the Sword, their Bow In Fury they have bent, To wound the Destitute and Low, And slay the Innocent. 15By their own Swords their Hearts shall bleed, Their Bows shall be destroy'd: 16The just Man's little Stores exceed All by the Proud enjoy'd. 17For all the Arms the Wicked wield, Shall broke in peices fly: But on the Lord, their God and Shield, The Righteous safe rely. 18The Lord, who knows them, ev'ry Day The Upright will protect; Their Seed, till Time shall pass away, His Blessings may expect. 19They in a publick evil Hour, Shall free from Hurt abide: When Famine others shall devour, They shall be satisfy'd. 20But wicked Men shall perish, they, Who Thee, O Lord, defy, Like Fat of Lambs, shall melt away, Away like Smoak shall fly. 21Th' Unjust and Proud grown poor and low Borrow, nor pay agen: But, see, the Righteous Mercy show And give to needy Men. 22By such, as of the Lord are blest, The Earth shall be enjoy'd; And they, whom he has curst, no Rest Shall find, but be destroy'd. Part III. 23The Lord their Footsteps do's secure, And guide their Counsels right, Whose Way, because it's just and pure, Is pleasing in his Sight. 24What if he fall? he'll be restor'd; Cast down, he'll rise and stand: For to uphold him, see, the Lord Sends forth his saving Hand. 25I who was young and now am old, Still saw the Just were fed; Nor did their Seed in Want behold, And left to beg their Bread. 26So far from this, to Men in need He's merciful and lends; And in sure Blessings on his Seed, His Charity descends. 27With Care depart from evil Ways, And in good Works abound; Then surely shall thy coming Days Be long and prosp'rous found. 28The Lord loves Right, nor leaves his Saints, He will preserve their Race; But load th' Ungodly with Complaints, And their vile Seed efface. 29The Righteous shall the Land possess, And there for ever dwell: 30His Mouth shall prudent Things express, His Tongue of Judgment tell. 31The Law of God is in his Heart, His Steps ne'er slide or stray: 32The Wicked watch, with treach'rous Art, The righteous Man to slay. 33The Lord against all Force employ'd, The Upright will Support; And if condemn'd, he'll render void The Sentence of the Court. Part IV. 34Wait on the Lord, and keep his Way, And thine the Land shall be; Th' Unjust entirely shall decay, This Thou thy self shalt see. 35The Wicked I have often seen With Pow'r and Honour crown'd; And like a Bay-tree young and green, Spreading himself around: 36Yet soon he vanish'd, like a Shade, And, lo, he ceas'd to be; And tho' strict Search I for him made, His Place I could not see. 37Well to the perfect Man attend, With Care the Upright mind, And, that their Ways and Counsels end In Peace, thou still wilt find. 38But all alike th' ungodly Race, Shall dreadful Wrath endure; The Wicked cut from off their Place At last shall perish sure. 39But the Salvation of the Just Is certain from the Lord: In trouble He, their Strength and Trust, Protection will afford. 40The Lord will help and save them, He Will sure Deliv'rance send; He'll from the Wicked set them free, Since they on him depend. Psalm XXXVIII. 1 Me do not, Lord, in Rage withstand, Nor in thy Wrath chastise: 2Thine Arrows peirce me, and thy Hand Sore on thy Servant lies. 3No Parts of all my Flesh are sound, While Thou do'st Anger shew; And in my Bones no Rest is found, While Guilt do's Fear renew. 4Sins, like a Flood, whelm o'er my Head, A Weight too great to bear; 5Sores, that chastise my Folly, spread Ill Scents amid'st the Air. 6Down I am born and sore distrest, All Day my Sorrows last; 7Sharp burning pains my Loins molest, My Flesh Diseases waste. 8Feeble and broke, I roar and groan, To ease my troubled Heart; 9All my Desire to God is known, My Groans and grievous Smart. 10My panting Heart strives in my Breast, Of Strength I am bereft; As to the Light my Eyes possest, That also me has left. Part II. 11My Friends and Lovers stand aside, By Reason of my Sore; And Numbers near in Blood ally'd, My State aloof deplore. 12They, who design my Blood to shed, Their Snares to catch me lay; They, who would hurt me, Mischief spread, And frame Deceit all Day. 13But like the Deaf, I heard no more, Like Mutes, I silent sate: 14Thus, as a senseless Man, I bore Without Reproofs their Hate. 15For God's my Hope, he'll hear my Voice, And answer, when I call: 16Hear me, I said, left they rejoice, And triumph o'er my Fall. 17I soon must halt without thy Care, Still Sorrows me oppress: 18I'll my Iniquity declare, My Sin with Shame confess. 19My Foes enjoy a prosp'rous State, Are strong, and live in Peace, And they, who bear me causeless Hate, In Pow'r and Rage increase. 20All those, who Actions good and kind With Evil do requite, My Cruel Enemies I find, Because I follow Right. 21Forsake me not, my God most High, Nor distant from me stand: 22Lord, my Salvation, swiftly fly To help me with thy Hand. Psalm XXXIX. 1 I said, I'll to my Ways attend, My Tongue shall Truth pursue; Nor shall my bridled Mouth offend, While I the Wicked view. 2Silent I stood without Complaint, From Good my Peace I held: My Sorrow then by this Restraint Stir'd in my Bosom swell'd. 3My Heart by Contemplation burn'd, The Fire glow'd in my Breast, While in my Thoughts Events I turn'd, Then I these Words exprest; 4To me my End, Jehovah, show, The Measure of my Days; That I, how frail I am, may know, And how short Life decays. 5Behold my Days are as a Span, As nought with Thee my Age; At its best State, the Life of Man Is a vain, transient Stage. 6Sure anxious Man walks up and down A shad'wy, empty Show: He heaps up Wealth, but who shall own His Treasure, do's not know. Part II. 7Now, Lord, what wait I for? from Thee, My Hope, I succour claim: 8Let not my Sins unpardon'd be, Nor Fools reproach my Name. 9My Minutes I in Silence spent, And clos'd my Mouth, as dumb, When I consider'd this Event, Did by thy Order come. 10Let me thy dreadful Stroke avoid, To which expos'd I stand; See, by the Blow I am destroy'd Inflicted by thy Hand. 11When Sinners feel thy chast'ning Wrath, They soon grow weak and wan, And fade, like Vests eat by the Moth; How vain a Thing is Man! 12Lord, hear my Pray'r, and to my Cry, And flowing Tears give ear, For with Thee, like my Fathers, I A Stranger sojourn here. 13O spare me, Lord, O Mercy show, Some Respite I implore, Grant me some Strength, 'ere hence I go, And shall be here no more. Psalm XL. 1 In waiting on the Lord, my Strength, Unmov'd I persever'd: And He inclin'd his Ear at length, And my Petition heard. 2From a dire Pit he set me free, Where I stiff Mire endur'd, And to a Rock uplifted me, And thus my Feet assur'd. 3I a new Song of Praise indite, Praise to our God most High; Many shall fear, who weigh it right, And on the Lord rely. 4Blest is the Man, who do's repose Trust in the Lord all wise; Nor do's respect the Proud, nor those Who turn aside to Lyes. 5O Lord, my God, thy Wonders done, And Thoughts on our Account, Cannot by reck'ning e'er be known, All Numbers they surmount. 6Thou did'st not rich Oblations, Lord, Nor Sacrifice desire; To serve Thee thou my Ears hast bor'd, Nor Off'rings did'st require. 7Then said I, Lo, I come, of me This of thy Book is Part: 8Thy Will's my Joy, thy Precepts, see, My God, are in my Heart. 9I in th' Assembly great explain'd Pure Righteousness to all; Nor from this Task my Lips refrain'd, I God to witness call. 10Thy Faithfulness I've not conceal'd, But did thy Goodness own: Joy'd thy Salvation I reveal'd, And strove to make it known. Part II. 11Lord do not Thou from me remove Thy Mercies manifold, But let thy Truth and kindest Love For ever me uphold. 12I'm compass'd with unnumber'd Snares, Guilt Hold upon me takes; I'm sunk, my Sins exceed my Hairs, And me my Heart forsakes. 13Be it thy Pleasure, Lord, I pray, To come and succour me, O in Compassion haste away, To help and set me free. 14Let all alike Confusion fill, Who at my Ruin aim, And may my Foes, who wish me Ill, Beat back be put to Shame. 15Let them ly waste and desolate, Their due and just Reward, Who triumph'd o'er my needy State, And no Reproaches spar'd. 16Be those, that seek Thee, glad, and they Who thy Salvation love, With grateful Zeal unceasing say, Extol the Lord above. 17Tho' I am poor, distress'd, and low, He keeps me in his Mind; Thou my Deliv'rer help bestow, With speed, my God, be kind. Psalm XLI. 1 He's blest, who pays a due Regard To Men with Want opprest; God will his Charity reward, In Trouble give him Rest. 2The Lord will keep him in Repose, Blest he on Earth shall live; Nor to the Will of envious Foes Him will he ever give. 3When languishing this Man shall mourn, The Lord will raise his Head, And in his Sickness often turn, And kindly make his Bed. 4Thy Mercy, Lord, to me express, I said, and heal my Soul, With Sin I'm wounded I confess, In pity make me whole. 5My Foes have Evil of me said, In Malice they exclaim, When shall we hear that he is dead? When perish shall his Name? 6And if he comes to visit me, He Falsehood do's devise, His Heart conceives Iniquity, When gone, he spreads his Lyes. Part II. 7All they, that bear me groundless Hate, In Whispers me defame, And when in secret Counsels sate Against me Mischief frame. 8An ill Disease cleaves to him fast, Say they, who me despise, And now he lies, down justly cast, Nor ever more shall rise. 9My bosom Friend, in whom, misled, I did my Trust repose, Against me, tho' he eat my Bread, With brutal Malice rose. 10But Thou, O gracious Lord, to me Be merciful, I pray, And raise me up to that Degree, That I may them repay. 11Thy Favour, Lord, I know by this, I can't in question call, Because my Foes the Triumph miss, They hop'd for in my Fall. 12And me in my Integrity, Thou do'st, O Lord, defend; Before thy Face thou settest me To Days that never end. 13Be praise to Israel's God addrest, By all the Sons of Men; Let him from Age to Age be blest, Say all, Amen, Amen. Psalm XLII. 1 As pants the Hart in sunburnt Lands, Which Brooks of Water want, And the refreshing Stream demands, So after God I pant. 2My Soul do's thirst for God, my Lord, That do's for ever live; When, to his Holy Place restor'd, Shall I due Praises give? 3All Day and Night my flowing Tears The Place of Meat supply, While envious Foes, where now appears Thy God? for ever cry. 4When I forsaken of Relief This in Rememb'rance bear, I vent my Soul in Strains of Grief, And pour it out in Pray'r. Troubled I think how once with Throngs Of shouting People prest, I reach'd thy House, and with glad Songs, And Praise we kept the Feast. 5What do's my Soul cast down affright? Why art thou in distress? Hope thou in God, thee with its Light His Countenance shall bless. 6My Soul's dejected, therefore still My God I'll call to Mind, To Jordan's Land, to Hermon's Hill Or Missar's when confin'd. Part II. 7Deep calls to Deep, Abyss invites Abyss to swell my Woe, While Noise with Noise tempestuous fights Thy Billows o'er me flow. 8Yet will the bounteous Lord each Day To me his Favours give; Each Night to God I'll sing and pray, By whom upheld I live. 9I'll say to God, my Rock, O why Do'st Thou me thus forget? Why do I mourning go and sigh By the proud Foe beset. 10It cuts my Soul, e'en as a Sword Deep in my Bowels thrust, While taunting Foes cast out this Word, Where is thy God, thy Trust? 11Why art thou troubled thus my Soul? Why cast by Sorrow down? Hope thou in God, he'll make thee whole, Who is my God and Crown. Psalm XLIII. 1 Judge me, my Cause impartial scan, And save me, Lord, my Trust, From factious People, and the Man Deceitful and unjust. 2God of my Strength, why do'st thou frown, And cast me off in Scorn? Why go I mourning up and down Opprest and overborn? 3Send forth, O Lord, thy heav'nly Light, Thy spotless Truth display, And to thy holy Mountain's Height Let them conduct my Way. 4Then to thy Altar I'll repair, Lord, my exceeding Joy, I will the Harp in Praise and Pray'r, O God, my God, employ. 5Why art Thou troubled thus, my Soul? Why cast by Sorrow down? Hope thou in God, He'll make thee whole, Who is my God and Crown. Psalm XLIV. 1 O Lord, with Wonder we have heard, What Age to Age has told, How in our Father's Days appear'd Thy mighty Works of Old. 2How Thou did'st scatter with thy Hand, And heathen Nations rout, Did'st with thy People plant the Land, And cast the Natives out. 3Not their own Sword, nor Arm, nor Might, Gain'd Canaan's Land, but Thine, And of thy Countenance the Light, That favours Jacob's Line. 4Thou art, O God, my Sov'raign Head, For Jacob Peace command: 5Thro' Thee we under foot shall tread All, who our Pow'r withstand. 6For of my Sword I will not vaunt, Nor make my Trust my Bow; 7But Thou Salvation, Lord, did'st grant, And put to Shame the Foe. 8In God our Saviour we rejoyce, And triumph all the Day, For ever we lift up our Voice, Thy Praises to display. Part II. 9But now cast off, as nothing worth, We are in Shame brought down; Nor dost Thou lead our Armies forth, Nor us with Conquest crown. 10Of God forsaken now we run, And routed leave the Field, And to the Foe, the Battle done, Our Camp and Spoil we yeild. 11See, Thou hast giv'n up Jacob's Race, Like Sheep for Meat design'd, And scatter'd us from Place to Place, Where heathen Lords we find. 12Thou sell'st thy Tribes for nought, no gain Do's from their Price redound; 13A Scorn and By-Word we remain To neighb'ring Lands around. 14Thou do'st among the Heathen make Jacob a Proverb grow, Their Head they in Derision shake, And mock us brought so low. 15This my Confusion still has bred, I'm cover'd with Disgrace, With settled Shame I'm overspread, And mournful hide my Face; 16Because of those, that Slander sow, Blaspheme and me revile, By reason of the wicked Foe Full of Revenge and Guile. Part III. 17All this we bore, yet Thou wilt grant, We still remember'd Thee, And kept thy sacred Covenant From all false Dealing free. 18We still to God have been sincere, And upright was our Heart; We to his Worship did adhere, Nor from his Precepts start; 19Tho' we in Places desolate Extream Affliction bore, And with the Shades of Death of late, Have, Lord, been cover'd o'er. 20If we forgot Thee, and our Hands To a strange God did raise; 21Shall God not know, who understands Our Hearts, and secret Ways? 22Yea, we, because our God thou art, As Sheep are deem'd by all; As Sheep for Slaughter set apart, By dayly Wounds we fall. 23Why sleepest Thou, Lord, wake and rise, Nor cast us from thy Care: 24Hide not thy Face, do'st Thou despise Th' Affliction which we bear? 25For we are bow'd down to the Dust, Fall'n on the Earth we ly; 26Arise and help us, Lord, our Trust, Help, we for Mercy cry. Psalm XLV. 1 My Heart indites a lofty Song, Th' important Theme regards the King, Like a swift Writer's Pen, my Tongue Shall flow inspir'd, and Wonders sing. 2Thou do'st in Beauty all excell, Pour'd on thy Lips sits Grace Divine, That blest with Empire Thou may'st dwell, Which coming Times shall not confine. 3Thy dreadful Sword gird on thy Thigh, Thou mighty One, whom Glories crown, Thy conqu'ring Sword, thy. Dignity, Magnificence and bright Renown. 4While Thou do'st glorious Aims pursue, Ride prosp'rous in thy Majesty, As Thou art righteous, mild and true, Shall matchless Deeds be done by Thee. 5Their Way thy Arrows swiftly wing, And deeply wound the Hearts of those, Who in their Pride withstand the King, Thus Thou shalt quell the stubborn Foes. 6Thy Throne, O God, establish'd stands, Against all Pow'r and Rage secure; The Scepter, which thy Hand commands Is right, and ever shall endure. 7Thou hatest Ill, and art most Just, Hence God, thy God anointed Thee With joyful Oyl, for thy great Trust, High o'er thy Fellows in Degree. 8Thy Robes are full of Aloes, Rich Myrrh and Cassia, fragrant Smells, Diffus'd from Iv'ry Palaces, In which the King delighted dwells. 9Daughters of Kings were in the Train, That on the Royal Bride did wait, The Queen in Gold of Ophir's Vein, On thy Right Hand illustrious sate. Part II. 10O Daughter hearken, and to me Incline thine Ear, imperial Spouse; Forget thy Land, thy Family, And Customs of thy Father's House. 11So shall the King thy Love desire, And in thy Beauty take Delight: Do Thou, thy royal Lord admire, And worship Him, when in his Sight. 12Th' Inhabitants of Tyre shall bring Their precious Gifts, and Homage pay; And, to be favour'd by the King, The wealthy shall thy Favour pray. 13See, all within the royal Bride Do's in Endowments glorious shine; And her wide Robes are beautify'd With Works of Gold from Ophir's Mine. 14She to the King in Pomp is led, In Raiment by the Needle wrought; Bright Virgins, Fellows with her bred, That follow, shall to Thee be brought. 15Rejoicing on this happy Day, They'll march along in solemn State; And clad in costly bright Array, Will enter at the Palace Gate. 16The Sons, that from thy Blood descend, Of Ancestors shall fill the Place, These mighty Princes shall extend Their Empire o'er the Earth's wide Face. 17I'll make all Generations know Thy Greatness, in succeeding Days; By me thy glorious Name shall grow The Theme of everlasting Praise. Psalm XLVI. 1 God is our Refuge, Strength, and Shield, To whom we Safety owe; He present Help vouchafes to yield, When Troubles overflow. 2We therefore will not fear, suppose The Earth should be remov'd; And Hills, by Winds or inward Throws, Should mid'st the Seas be shov'd. 3And tho' the Waters of the Deep Disquieted should roar, And angry Billows, rous'd from sleep, Should swell and shake the Shore. 4Yet there's a River sweet and still, Which branching runs its Race, That shall with Joy God's City fill, Th' Almighty's Holy Place. 5God do's her Guardian, in her, stay, Then can she be afraid? To bring her Help he'll not delay, When Danger shall invade. 6The Heathen rag'd, and Potentates Tumultuous did appear, In Wrath th' Almighty spoke, the States And Realms did melt with Fear. 7The Lord of Armies guards our State, Jacob! thy God's our Aid; 8Come see his Works, how desolate Has he the Nations made! 9He thro' the Lands makes War to cease, He breaks the Spear and Bow, And burns in Fire, to give us Peace, The Chariots of the Foe. 10Henceforth be still, and understand That I am God, ev'n I, Exalted I'll the Earth command, And raise my Name on high. 11The Lord of Hosts is on our Side, We therefore are secure; The God of Jacob will abide Our Strength and Refuge sure. Psalm XLVII. 1 Ye People clap your Hands, and sing, To God loud Praises send; 2For God is dreadful, high, a King Whose Laws o'er all extend. 3The People for us he subdues, He'll Realms beneath us place; 4Our Heritage for us He'll chuse, The Crown of Jacob's Race. 5To Zion God's gone up, the Ways With Shouts and Trumpets ring; 6Sing Praise, sing Praise to God, sing Praise, Sing Praises to our King. 7God King of all the Earth remains, Let Praise with Skill be shown; 8God o'er the heathen People reigns, Plac'd on his holy Throne. 9Where Chiefs and Tribes in Worship joyn, Who Abraham's God assert; Lord, all the Pow'rs on Earth are Thine, Thou high exalted art. Psalm XLVIII. 1 The Lord is glorious, high, and great, Then let his Praise the Kingdom fill, From God's peculiar chosen Seat, Ev'n beauteous Zion's sacred Hill. 2 Zion! thy Situation's fair, Thou Joy of all the Earth around; Great King, thy City high in Air On the North Quarter stands renown'd. 3In her aspiring Palaces, God is a pow'rful Refuge known; 4Confed'rate Kings, repell'd with Ease, Are from her Walls inglorious gone. 5They saw, they wonder'd and they shook, In Fear they hasted o'er the Plains; 6And Terrour Hold upon them took, Suddain, as Womens Labour-pains. 7Thou to our Foes in Wrath do'st speak, And drive them with resistless Force; As eastern Winds tempestuous break The Ships of Tashish in their Course. 8Wonders of Goodness have our Eyes Beheld, like those, that we have heard; Therefore the Lord of Hosts will rise, And his lov'd City ever guard. Part II. 9Thy Works of Loving Kindness, Lord, Our deepest Contemplation rais'd, When in the Temple we ador'd, And (silent) Thee besought and prais'd. 10According to thy fam'd Success, Thy Praise is universal grown; Full is thy Hand of Righteousness, By just and holy Actions known. 11Let Zion's sacred Hill rejoyce, And Judah's Daughters spread around, Unite in joyful Shouts their Voice, Who are with such Deliv'rance crown'd. 12Let the fair City be survey'd, Walk all about, and count her Tow'rs; Are any hurt or level laid By all the Force of hostile Pow'rs? 13Her Palaces undamag'd mind, Her Bulwarks and her Walls entire; Tell to your Sons, how God is kind, They this Salvation will admire. 14For this great King, this God of Might, To the last Date of Time is ours: He will support and guide us right, Till Death this mortal State devours. Another Metre. 1 Great is the Lord, then his Abode Let solemn Praises fill, Ev'n in the City of our God, In Zion's sacred Hill. 2 Zion! thy Situation's fair, Thou Joy of Lands around! Great King, thy City high in Air Stands on the North, renown'd. 3In her aspiring Palaces, God is a Refuge known; 4Confed'rate Kings repell'd with Ease, Are from her Bulwarks gone. 5They saw, they wonder'd, frighted shook, And hasten'd o'er the Plains; 6Fear suddain Hold upon them took, Like Womens Labour-Pains. 7Thou to our Foes with matchless Force Do'st sure Destruction speak, As eastern Tempests in their Course The Ships of Tarshish break. 8The Wonders we have heard, we see, Lord, in thy City done, The City of our God, which He With endless Strength will crown. 9We mid'st thy House, thy gracious Ways And Love, did quiet mind; 10As is thy Name so is thy Praise, Thy Hand most Just we find. 11Let Zion's sacred Hill rejoyce, With Judah's Towns around; And lift in Songs of Praise their Voice, With such Deliv'rance crown'd. 12Let the fair City be survey'd, Walk heedful, count her Tow'rs, Are any hurt, or level laid By proud invading Pow'rs? 13Her Palaces undamag'd mind, Her Gates and Walls entire; Tell to your Sons, how God is kind, They'll this great Work admire. 14This God is ours, this God of Might, For ever us secures, He'll give Support, and guide us right, As long as Life endures. Psalm XLIX. 1 Hear this, to all the Lands I call, Hear all, who dwell on Earth, 2Who rich or needy are, and all Of base or noble Birth. 3My Mouth shall weighty Things impart, Which in my Mind arise, The Meditation of my Heart Shall be, to make you wise. 4My Ear shall due Attention pay To deep and hidden Things; Dark Parables will I display Upon the Harp's sweet Strings. 5What in the Black and evil Day Have I just Cause to dread, When Snares, that Foes to catch me lay, Around my Feet are spread? 6Can they, who trust in Pow'r, and boast Of Wealth their Brother save? 7Or gain from God at any Cost His Ransom from the Grave? 8For scarce this Priviledge is known, Scarce can it ever be, 9That one should Life unfading own, And ne'er Corruption see. 10Behold, the Wise and Dull of Mind The Tombs alike receive; Man heaps up Riches, which behind He must to others leave. Part II. 11They think their House for ever stands, That still their Race shall live; And to their Dwelling Place and Lands Their Names they proudly give. 12But Man in Honour cannot stay, Like Beasts he ends his Days; 13This is their Foolishness, yet they, Who follow, like their Ways. 14Like Sheep Death them shall eat, o'er whom Rais'd up the Just shall reign, Their Beauty in the Grave, their Home, No longer shall remain. 15But God will me from Danger save, Not to Destruction leave; He will redeem me from the Grave, And to himself receive. 16Fear not when one great Wealth acquires, When high his Children rise; 17He leaves it all, when he expires, His Glory with him dies. 18Tho' when he liv'd, he void of Shame In Riot spent his Days, And thou, if thou wilt do the same, Shalt have the Flatt'rers Praise; 19To his dead Fathers he shall go, And still in Darkness lye; 20Princes, That inconsid'rate grow, Are like the Beasts that dye. Psalm L. 1 The mighty God spoke from his Throne, And call'd the Earth from East to West: 2God out of Zion clearly shone, Zion, with perfect Beauty blest. 3Our God shall come in awful Pow'r, Nor will He still be silent found; A Fire before Him shall devour, And dreadful Tempests rage around. 4He to the Earth and Heav'ns above Shall call, and thus his Will declare, That I in judging Righteous prove, Ye Heav'n and Earth now Witness bear. 5Gather my Saints before my Throne, Whom Sacrifice to me has knit, 6The Heav'ns shall make his Justice known, For God do's Judge in Person sit. 7O Israel, hear, I'll thee indite, My Charge against thee I'll declare, I am thy God by FÃ¦d'ral Rite, As thou art my peculiar Care. 8Thy Sacrifice I will not blame, Nor Off'rings, which I still behold; 9No Bullock from thy House I claim, Nor He-Goats from thy crouded Fold. 10For ev'ry Forest-Beast I own, Herds, which a thousand Hills can yield; 11All Mountain-Fowls to me are known, Mine are the Beasts, that range the Field. 12Would I, if I were hungry, tell My Wants, thy Bounty to incline? Is not the World, with all that dwell Therein, ev'n all its Fulness mine? 13That Flesh of Bulls can be a Fare, Which I will eat, what Man can think? If you the Blood of Goats prepare, Believe you I their Blood will drink? 14Give Thanks, and pay to God most High Thy Vows, in Trouble call on me; 15And thou my Name shalt glorify, For thou shalt my Salvation see. Part II. 16But to the Wicked, says the Lord, How darest thou usurp my Name, Declare my Statutes, boast my Word, And sacred Covenant proclaim? 17Since thou dost scorn and hate the Light, Perversely Truth divine distaste, And wise Instruction, in Despite Of my Command, behind thee cast. 18Thou saw'st a Thief, did'st with him joyn, And give him Aid for Profit's Sake; Thou with Adult'rers did'st combine, And of their heinous Guilt partake. 19Thy Mouth is full of Calumnies, Thy Tongue do's Fraud and Falsehood frame: 20Thou dost thy Brother wound with Lies, Ev'n thine own Mother's Son defame. 21This thou hast done, nor did I show Displeasure, whence thou did'st collect That I resembled thee, but know, I'll punish and thy Sins detect. 22This in your Minds consid'rate bear, Ye Fools, who God remember not; Left you in Pieces I should tear, While no Deliv'rer can be got. 23Th' Oblations of religious Praise, Give me the Glory to me due; To him, who orders right his Ways, I will my sure Salvation shew. Another Metre. 1 The God possest Of Might, the Lord did call, From East to West His Voice did summon all. 2Behold, when He Shall forth from Zion go, He'll Majesty And perfect Beauty show. 3Our God shall come To judge; before his Face, Flames shall consume, And Tempests fill the Place. 4To witness He Shall call on Earth and Heav'n, That they may see On all just Judgment giv'n. 5Let all my Saints Before me gather'd be; Who Covenants By Blood have made with Me. 6The Heav'ns agree God's Justice to acquit, For righteously To judge, Himself will sit. 7My Tribes once dear Attend, the Charge is mine; O Israel, hear, I am thy God, e'en thine. 8Unblam'd by me Thy Sacrifices are, And Off'rings free, Burnt with continual Care. 9If that be all, I will nor Ox, behold, Take from thy Stall, Nor He-Goat from thy Fold. 10Each Beast I own Which Forest Walks confine; The Herds that crown, A thousand Hills, are mine. 11I know the Nests Which Fowls in Mountains build, And the wild Beasts Are mine in ev'ry Field. 12Hungry were I, I would not tell it Thee For my Supply, The World belongs to Me. 13Shall of the Bull The Flesh be my repast? Can Vessels full Of Goats-blood please my Taste? 14Off'rings each Day Of Thanks to God renew, Vows solemn pay To the most High, his due: 15And from me crave Help in thy saddest Days; Thee will I save, And thou shalt spread my Praise. Part II. 16But to confound Th' Unjust, says God, dost thou, My Laws expound, And dare to name my Vow? 17Since thou do'st grow Blind to instructive Light, And from thee throw My Words, my Precepts slight. 18Thou saw'st a Thief, And with him did'st combine; And without Grief Did'st with Adult'rers joyn. 19See, thy loose Tongue Thy Neighbour do's defame; Thy Mouth do's wrong, And Snares deceitful Frame. 20Thou sit'st with Lyes Thy Brother's Cause to wound; Thy Calumnies Thy Mother's Son confound. 21This Thou hast done, And while I Speech declin'd, Thou thought'st me One According to thy Mind. But to chastise Thy Sins I'll not forget, Before thine Eyes I'll all in Order set. 22Of this beware, You, who my Patience try, Lest you I tear, While none to save is nigh. 23Who offers Praise, Me glorifies, and he Who seeks right Ways, Shall my Salvation see. Psalm LI. 1 Let me find Pity often prov'd, Nor of thy Kindness doubt; Lord, by thy tender Mercies mov'd, Blot my Transgressions out. 2Purge my Pollution, make me new, And cleanse my sinful Stains; 3I own my Guilt, and in my View Still my Offence remains. 4I've sinn'd against Thee, Thee alone, And done this in thy Sight, Which I declare, that all may own Thy Judgments just and right. 5See, shapen in Iniquity, To be I did begin; In Guilt my Mother went with me, And brought me forth in Sin. 6Thou do'st, most holy Lord, desire Truth in the inward Part, And Wisdom without Guile require, And Purity of Heart. 7Purge, as with Hyssop, my foul Stain, And I shall spotless grow; Cleanse me, and I shall white remain As unpolluted Snow. 8Let me of Joy, I Thee invoke, And Gladness hear the Voice; So shall the Bones, which Thou hast broke, Made whole by Thee rejoyce. 9View not my Crimes, that cause thy Hate, Blot out my Sin and Shame; 10Lord, a clean Heart in me create, And a right Spirit frame. Part II. 11Me from thy Presence do not cast, Thy Spirit ne'er recall; 12Restore the Joy of Favours past; Uphold me lest I fall. 13Then I'll by my Experience teach Transgressors thy just Ways; I'll Truth divine to Sinners preach, And Converts to Thee raise. 14O Lord, my Saviour, set me free From the great Guilt of Blood, And of thy Mercy shown to me My Tongue shall sing aloud. 15Lord, open Thou my Lips, of late Shut up by Grief and Shame; Then shall my Mouth thy Praise relate, Thy Clemency proclaim. 16Thou Sacrifice do'st not desire, Burnt Off'rings not enjoy; Else should thy Altar's hallow'd Fire Whole Herds and Flocks destroy. 17Th' Oblations, which the Lord approves, Are bruis'd afflicted Minds; A meek and contrite Heart he loves, This still Acceptance finds. 18In thy good Pleasure, Lord, be kind To Zion, when she calls; And by thy Mercy be inclin'd To build up Salem's Walls. 19And now with Sacrifices free The Righteous Thee appease, Burnt Off'ring, whole Oblation Thee With offer'd Bullocks please. Psalm LII. 1 Why boastest thou, O Man of Pow'r, Thy self of Mischief past? God's Goodness to the latest Hour, Know shall unalter'd last, 2The Slanders, which thy Heart contrives, Thy Tongue disperses round, And, like a treach'rous Razor, gives An unexpected Wound. 3Thou more, than Good, do'st Evil love, Than Justice, Lies and Wrong; 4Destructive Words thou do'st approve, O thou deceitful Tongue! 5For ever God shall Thee destroy, Thee and thy House efface; That, rooted out, thou may'st enjoy No more on Earth a Place. 6This you shall see and fear, ye Just, And laugh at his Distress, 7Who makes not God his Strength and Trust, But Wealth and Wickedness. 8But like an Olive always green, I in thy House abide; Lord, in thy Mercy, still my Screen, For ever I'll confide. 9I'll Praise, since thou did'st this effect, Still send to Thee above; Thy Pow'r and Goodness I'll expect, Such Trust thy Saints approve. Psalm LIII. 1 The Fool hath said within his Heart, No God our Deeds rewards: Corrupted all from Truth depart, And Justice none regards. 2The Lord look'd down from Heav'n to view The Stock of Human Kind, To learn, if any rightly knew, And search'd the Lord to find. 3All are gone back from Thee, O Lord, All are polluted grown: Are any that observe thy Word Remaining? No, not one. 4Can into Ignorance so great These evil Workers fall, Who eat my People up as Bread? On God they never call. 5Their Souls were seiz'd with groundless Fright, For God their Camp did raise, Thou mad'st them fall in shameful Flight, For God despis'd their Ways. 6From Zion, who'll Redemption give, And back our Captives bring? Then Jacob shall in Triumph live, And Israel shout and sing. Psalm LIV. 1 To Save me by thy Name appear, And judge me by thy Pow'r, 2Lord, to my earnest Pray'r give Ear, Hear me in this sad Hour. 3In Arms a strange and barb'rous Crew Against thy Servant rise; Oppressors proud my Life pursue, O God, they Thee despise. 4The Lord my Helper is with those, Who to uphold me stand, 5With Evil he'll reward my Foes: Slay in thy Truth their Band. 6I'll freely sacrifice to Thee, I'll Praise Thee, for 'tis good; 7From Trouble he has set me free, I've seen my Foes subdu'd. Psalm LV. 1 To my repeated Pray'r give Ear, Nor my Complaints despise; 2To me attend, O Lord, and hear My loud and mournful Cries. 3For Foes, who to oppress me aim, My constant Grief create; They with their Slanders blast my Name, And me in Wrath they hate. 4My Heart is in me troubled sore, Death's Terrours on me light; 5Amazing Horrours, whelm me o'er, I tremble with Affright. 6I ask'd the Dove's swift Wing, that I For Rest might speed my Way, 7And wand'ring hence far off might fly, And in the Desart stay. 8From the fierce Storm to guard my Life, I would escape in haste; 9Divide and break them, Lord, for Strife And Rage the City waste. 10They round the Walls go Night and Day, Mischiefs within are found; 11Fraud, Guile, and ev'ry wicked Way Amid'st her Streets abound. Part II. 12Wrongs from a known invet'rate Foe I calmly had endur'd, From such as open Hatred show, I had my self secur'd: 13But it was Thou, a Man well known, One standing by my Side; My Friend to me familiar grown, My Equal and my Guide. 14I on his Counsels did rely, My Bosom to him vent; And to the House of God most High In Company we went. 15Let Death this treach'rous Race oppress, And sink them quick to Hell, For impious Pride and Wickedness In all their Houses dwell. 16But I will still to God apply, The Lord will me protect; 17At Ev'n, at Morn, and Noon I'll cry H'ell not my Pray'r reject. 18My Soul he rescu'd in the Hour, When Hosts against me rag'd; Tho' theirs was great, yet greater Pow'r Was on my Side engag'd. 19Jehovah, who abides of old, Will hear and them chastise; Their prosp'rous State unchang'd they hold, And therefore God despise. 20Against the Peaceful he his Hand In Malice did extend; His Covenant he has profan'd, Made with a constant Friend. 21Smoother than Butter were his Words, But War was in his Heart; His Lips, tho' soft as Oyl, like Swords, Did cut with treach'rous Art. 22On God thy careful Burden cast, And thou shalt be upheld; The Just may suffer, but at last Their Fears shall be dispell'd. 23Th' Unjust destroy'd entomb'd shall ly, The false and bloody Race Scarce live out half their Days, but I My Trust in God will place. Psalm LVI. 1 Be merciful, O God, I pray, For Men would me devour; They fight against me all the Day, And use oppressive Pow'r. 2Daily my Foes would swallow me, Foes many, O most High: 3When Fears invade my Soul, on Thee For Safety I rely. 4In God I'll celebrate his Word, In God my Trust renew, And fear not what to me the Sword Of earthly Pow'rs can do. 5They wrest my Words when well design'd, To hurt me daily try; 6They mark my Steps together joyn'd, And hid to slay me ly. 7Lord, shall they by Iniquity Just Punishment avoid? Let the vile Race, cast down by Thee, In Anger be destroy'd. 8Thou know'st how wand'ring long my Way From Place to Place I took; My Tears in thy safe Bottle lay, Are they not in thy Book? 9That at my Pray'r my Foes shall fly, I know, for God's my Friend; 10I'll praise thy Word, O Lord most High, Thy Praise I will extend. 11In God I trust, nor am afraid Of all that Man can do; 12I'll pay to God the Vows I made, And render Praises due. 13God, who my Soul from Death restor'd, My Footsteps will assure, That I may walk before the Lord Mid'st living Men secure. Psalm LVII. 1 Have Mercy, Mercy, Lord, on me, My Soul on Thee I cast; Thy Wings shall my Protection be, Till those sad Days are past. 2To God most High I'll send my Cries, Whose Aid I still implor'd, To God, who ne'er to me denies Performance of his Word. 3He shall from Heav'n display his Pow'r His Servant to defend; He'll shame them who would me devour, He'll Truth and Mercy send. 4Mid'st Beasts, ev'n Men on Fire, I lie, Who wound with piercing Words; Words, that like Spears or Arrows fly From Tongues, that cut like Swords, 5Lord, higher than the highest Skies Exalt thy awful Head, And let thy boundless Glory rise, And o'er the Nations spread. 6Their Net they fix'd, on Mischief bent, My Soul bow'd down despair'd; But to the Pit they headlong went, Which they for me prepar'd. 7My Heart is fix'd, nor will it warp, O God, I'll sing thy Praise: 8Awake my Glory, Psaltry, Harp, My self I'll early raise. 9I to the Tribes, who Thee adore, Thy Praises will proclaim; Thro' Realms who Idol Gods implore, I'll magnifie thy Name. 10Thy Mercy Heav'n surmounts, as high Thy Truth exalts her Head: 11Lord, raise thy self above the Skie, O'er Earth thy Glory spread. Psalm LVIII. 1 Do you assembled Chiefs agree, Indeed, to stablish Right? Ye Sons of Men is your Decree Rul'd by impartial Light? 2Yea, you in Heart contrive all Day Some Mischief, some Offence, And in the Land Injustice weigh, And deal out Violence. 3The Wicked are to Righteousness, Ev'n from the Womb, estrang'd; In Ill they early Joy express, And are with Liars rang'd. 4Their Poison with the Serpent's vies, Or Asps, that stops her Ear, 5That let the Charm be e'er so wise, Will not the Charmer hear. 6Lord, break their Teeth from out their Head, That great Destruction cause; Break the strong Teeth, the People's Dread, In the young Lion's Jaws. 7Like Waters, that unceasing flow, O let them slide away; And let their Arrows from their Bow, As broke in pieces, stray. 8As Snails, that melt upon the Earth, So let them wasted be, Or as a Woman's unripe-Birth That ne'er does Day-light see. 9'Ere Pots can feel the kindling Thorn, He'll seize our Foes alive; Away in Wrath they shall be born, As Whirlwinds Stubble drive. 10When they this Vengeance see, the Good And Meek shall be o'erjoy'd, And dip their Feet deep in the Blood Of wicked Men destroy'd. 11Sure for the Just, now Men shall cry, There will be great Rewards; Sure there's a Righteous Judge on High, Who Good and Ill regards. Psalm LIX. 1 Save me, my God, from cruel Foes, Who arm'd against me fight; 2And rescue me with speed from those, Who take in Blood Delight. 3Lord, for my Soul they lie in wait, The Great against me joyn, Mov'd by their own invet'rate Hate, And no Offence of mine. 4Without my Fault they run with Speed, And Preparations make, How they against me may succeed; To help me, Lord, awake. 5Wake, Lord, the God of Israel's Race, The heathen Pow'rs suppress; To those no Favour show, nor Grace, Who wickedly transgress. 6When they have hunted me by Day, They come at Evening home; Like clam'rous Dogs, they seek their Prey, And thro' the City roam. 7They pour forth Floods of hurtful Words, Nor do they Vengeance fear; And while their Tongues are cutting Swords, They cry can any hear? 8But Thou shalt laugh, O Lord most high, At all their empty Pride; Thou shalt the heathen Pow'rs defy, And their vain Plots deride. Part II. 9Because my Foe is strong, on Thee I wait and crave Support; For Thou O God, art still to me A Refuge and a Fort. 10My gracious God shall me prevent, From whom my Mercies flow And let me see my Heart's Content Accomplish'd on my Foe. 11O Lord, our Shield, the Foe disperse, But not at once remove, That we may oft thy Praise reherse, And not forget thy Love. 12For their vile Words and Calumnies, Afflict them in their Pride; Avenge their Curses and their Lies, Which Me and Heav'n defy'd. 13Consume them, Lord, with Plagues and Pains And let them cease to Be, Then all, that Jacob's Sov'raign reigns, Through all the Earth, will see. 14When they have wander'd all the Day, Let them at Eve return, Like Dogs about the City stray, And famish'd howl and mourn. 15Let them, I say, in quest of Meat Abroad thro' Hunger roam, And finding no Supplies to eat, Come discontented home. 16But I thy Pow'r and Love will sing, When Morn its Light displays, For Thou did'st timely Succour bring, In black and stormy Days. 17O Thou my Strength, I'll sing to Thee, To Thee Defence I owe: Thou art, O God, the Fountain free, Whence all my Mercies flow. Psalm LX. 1 Thou hast, O God, our Cause forsook, With Jacob's Sons displeas'd; Scatter'd by Thee our Flight we took, O, turn again appeas'd. 2Thy Terrours did the Earth invade, Which sorely rent did quake; O heal the Breaches Thou hast made, See how its Pillars shake. 3Thou hast, on Punishment intent, Hard Burdens on us cast, The Wine of dire Astonishment Thy Wrath hath made us taste. 4Thou conqu'ring Banners gav'st to me, For those, who fear thy Name, To be display'd, that all may see, And loud thy Truth proclaim. 5Hear me, and thy lov'd People bless; 6God will his Oath maintain, I'll triumph, Sichem I'll possess, And mete out Succoth's Plain. 7 Gilead is mine, Manasseh mine, Ephraim my Head sustains, And favour'd Judah's Royal Line To Israel Laws ordains. 8 Moah my Slave shall wash my Feet, O'er Edom flies my Shoe; Can'st Thou our Arms, Philistia, meet, And Triumphs past renew? 9To Edom's Tow'rs, who now will lead, 10Lord, wilt not Thou our Shield? Tho' late our Cause Thou would'st not head, Nor with us take the Field. 11Help us in Woe, Man's Help, we see, Is vain, of no Renown; Thro' God we valiant grow, for He Shall tread our Rivals down. Psalm LXI. 1 Receive, my God, my earnest Cries, Which loud to Heav'n ascend; Do not my humble Pray'r despise, But to my Voice attend. 2To Thee, Lord, from our farthest Lands, When griev'd at Heart I'll pray; Thy Servant to the Rock, that stands Too high for me, convey. 3Thou art my Shelter often try'd, A Tow'r, that Safety brings; 4I'll in thy Holy Place abide, And rest beneath thy Wings. 5For Thou, O God, hast heard my Pray'rs, And hearken'd to my Vow; To me Thou wilt a Lot like theirs, Who fear thy Name, allow. 6God do's, by adding Days, the Stage Of the King's Life sustain, And graciously from Age to Age Has bid his Servant reign. 7He before God shall still abide, To save him Mercy shew; 8Then I'll thy Praise spread far and wide, And to my Vows be true. Psalm LXII. 1 I wait on God with Confidence, Him I my Saviour call, 2My only Rock, my strong Defence; I therefore cannot fall. 3New Mischief will you still intend, You surely shall be slain; You as a leaning Wall shall bend, As a weak Fence remain. 4They plot against my Excellence, Lies with delight they nurse, Blessings with flatt'ring Mouths dispence, But inwardly they curse. 5My Soul, wait thou on God alone, I still on him rely'd: 6Him my Defence and Rock I own, Hence I unmov'd abide. 7On God do's my Salvation rest, My Glory and my Crown; My Rock of Strength, to me opprest He's a sure Refuge known. 8Ye People hear with one Accord, Your Trust in him repose; Pour out your heart before the Lord, And He'll relieve your Woes. 9Sure Men of low Degree and high, If in the Ballance laid, Are Shadows, and an empty Lye By Vanity outweigh'd. 10Trust not in Violence, nor vain In Fraud and Robb'ry grow; Nor set thy Heart on worldly Gain, Should Riches overflow. 11Once God did Speak, this twice I heard, Pow'r and Goodwill are Thine; 12O God, who wilt a just Reward To all Men's Works assign. Psalm LXIII. 1 O God, thou art my God, betimes I'll seek Thee, Thee my Soul do's want; None covet more in burning Climes Fresh Water, than for Thee I pant. 2To see thy Pow'r, as I have seen, And Glory, in thy Holy Place: 3Dearer than Life, thy Love has been, Hence will I praise thy boundless Grace. 4Thus will I bless Thee, while I live, Obedient to thy high Commands; I'll send up Pray'rs and Praises give, And in thy Name lift up my Hands. 5When in thy House I shall abide, My Soul, as with rich Marrow fed, And Fatness, shall be satisfy'd, While joyful I thy Praises spread. 6Till I can gain that happy State, To think on Thee, I'll take Delight; In Bed, on Thee I'll meditate Thro' all the Watches of the Night. 7Since Thou did'st never Help refuse, I to thy Wings with Joy repair; 8Hard after Thee, my Soul pursues, Which thy Right-hand upholds with Care. 9But those, who would my Life betray, To the low Caves of Death are doom'd; 10Slain by the Sword, they'll lie a Prey By rav'ninng Beasts to be consum'd. 11Still shall the King in God rejoyce, And all that by Jehovah swear, Shall glory and applaud their Choice, But Wrath for Lyars he'll prepare. Another Metre. 1 O God, Thou art my God, betime I'll seek Thee, Thee I want: For Thee amid'st a thirsty Clime, I languish, long, and pant. 2To see thy Pow'r, as I have seen Thee in thy holy Seat: 3Dearer than Life thy Love has been, Hence I'll thy Praise repeat. 4Thus I will bless Thee still, I'll spread My Hands forth in thy Name; 5And as with Fat and Marrow fed, With Joy thy Praise proclaim. 6While I in Bed remember Thee, Jehovah, with Delight, And meditate attentively, Thro' ev'ry Stage of Night. 7Since Thou hast been my Help, I'll chuse To rest beneath thy Wings; 8Hard after Thee my Soul pursues, Thy Hand my Safety brings. 9But those, who would my Life betray, To Death's low Caves are doom'd 10Slain by the Sword they'll lie a Prey By Wolves to be consum'd. 11O King, in God rejoyce, and those, Who swear by God's great Name, Shall Glory, for the Lord will close The Lyar's Mouth with Shame. Psalm LXIV. 1 Lord, hear my Pray'r, and let me not By Foes be terrify'd; 2Me from th' Ungodly's secret Plot, And Rage tumultuous hide. 3They meditating Mischief whet Their Tongues, like keenest Swords; They bend their Bow, their Arrows set, Ev'n sharp and bitter Words. 4From lurking Holes, and secret Ground, They make them take their Flight, And fearless, point a suddain Wound Against the Man Upright. 5Encourag'd in an evil Way They Commune privily, How they may set their Snares, and say Profanely, who can See? 6In searching Ill their Hours they spend, Deep are their Thoughts and Heart, 7But God shall suddain Vengeance send, And wound them with his Dart. 8They'll with their Tongues each other tear, No Friends will with them stay; 9Men aw'd, God's Justice will declare, For they'll his Doing weigh. 10The Righteous shall in God delight, And ne'er of Safety doubt; And all that are in Heart upright, Triumphantly shall shout. Psalm LXV. 1 Praise waits for Thee, in Zion, we To Thee our sacred Vows will pay; 2O Thou, who hearest Pray'r, to Thee All Flesh in their Distress shall pray. 3Iniquities, I must allow, O'er me prevail with too great Sway; Lord, as for our Transgressions, Thou Wilt purge their heinous Guilt away. 4Bless'd is the Man, thy Care and Choice, Call'd to approach thy holy Place, And tread thy Courts, where we rejoyce, Fill'd with thy Gifts and heav'nly Grace. 5By Wonders wrought in our Defence, Lord, thy Salvation we shall find, Who art the Trust and Confidence Of sever'd Isles, and Kingdoms joyn'd. 6He girt with Pow'r, do's lift on high, And fixes on their Base the Hills; 7He bids loud Billows silent lie, And the mad People's Uproar stills. 8Remotest Realms with Terrour shake To hear thy awful Thunder's Voice, And see thy Fires, Thou, Lord, do'st make The Evening and the Morn rejoyce. 9Thou visitest the thirsty Ground With Rain, God's River of the Skies, Which cheers the Glebe, whence Fields abound With Corn, and rip'ning Harvests rise. 10Abundantly thy Dews distill On the glad Ridges of the Land; Thy soft'ning Show'rs the Furrows fill, Which fruitful grow at thy Command. 11Thou with thy Goodness crown'st the Year, The Clouds, Thou tread'st on, Fatness drop; 12They with their Stores the Desart cheer, And give the Hills a joyful Crop. 13The Pasture woolly Flocks adorn, With lowing Herds the Highlands ring; The spreading Vales are cloath'd with Corn, And shout for Joy, and grateful sing. Another Metre. 1 For Thee, of Praise the Tribute waits, O God, on Zion's Hill; The solemn Vow, that in my Streights I made, I'll now fulfill. 2O Thou on High, who hearest Pray'r In Heav'n, thy holy Throne, To Thee all Nations shall repair, To make their Trouble known. 3Iniquities, I must allow, O'er me have gotten Sway; Lord, as for our Transgressions, Thou Wilt purge their Guilt away. 4Happy the Man, who by thy Choice Still in thy Courts may live; We in thy Goodness will rejoyce, Which thy blest House shall give. 5By Wonders wrought in our Defence, We thy Salvation find, O God, who art the Confidence Of Isles and Kingdoms joyn'd. 6Girded with Pow'r He lifts on High, And fixes fast the Hills; 7He bids loud Billows silent lye, And the mad People stills. 8Remotest Realms with Terrour shake, To hear thy Thunder's Voice, And see thy Fires; Thou, Lord, do'st make The Morn and Eve rejoyce. 9Thou visitest the Ground with Rain, God's River in the Skies, Whence all the water'd Fields with Grain Are blest, and Harvests rise. 10Abundantly thy Dews distil Upon the furrow'd Land; Thy soft'ning Show'rs the Ridges fill, Which thrive at thy Command. 11Thou with thy Goodness crown'st the Year, Thy Paths rich Fatness drop; 12The Clouds, thy Walks, the Desart cheer, And give glad Hills their Crop. 13The Pasture woolly Flocks adorn, With Herds the Highlands ring; The spreading Vales are cloath'd with Corn, And shout for Joy and sing. Psalm LXVI. 1 O all ye Lands, Jehovah's Fame With Shouts of Triumph raise, 2Sing forth the Honour of his Name, And Glorious make his Praise. 3How awful are thy Works! o'erpow'r'd Foes shall Submission feign; 4Be Thou through all the Earth ador'd, Let none from Praise refrain. 5Come, and with Admiration see The Works, which God has wrought; How dreadful are the Things, which He On Adam's Sons has brought! 6The Lord to save his People dry'd The Waters with his Voice; Our Fathers pass'd on foot the Tide, And did in Him rejoyce. 7God by his Pow'r do's ever reign, The Nations He surveys: Then, Rebels, know that you in vain Yourselves against him raise. 8Ye People bless our God, 'tis meet, Loud let his Praises sound; 9Who guards our Life, and keeps our Feet Unmov'd on stable Ground. Part II. 10Thou hast a Test for us prepar'd, Try'd us, as Silver's try'd: 11Our Feet by Nets Thou hast ensnar'd, With Bonds our Loins hast ty'd. 12By Thee have Men with Burdens bent Our Heads, our Shoulders pain'd; By Thee thro' Fire and Floods we went, And a rich Seat have gain'd. 13I'll to thy House with Off'rings go, Fulfill'd my Vows shall be; 14Vows, which my Lips in Times of Woe, Have utter'd, Lord, to Thee. 15Of Fatlings I burnt Sacrifice Will on thy Altar lay; Rams shall in Smoke, like Incense, rise, I'll Goats and Bullocks slay. 16Come ye, who God have fear'd and sought, Attentive Ears prepare; What Wonders he for me has wrought, I will to all declare. 17My Pray'r did Favour with him win, Him I exalted high; 18But had I harbour'd Guilt within, Would God have heard my Cry? 19But surely me the Lord did hear: 20Be God for ever blest, Who from my Pray'r turn'd not his Ear, Nor Mercy has supprest. Psalm LXVII. 1 The Lord be merciful, and bless His People, Jacob's Line; And may his Face Goodwill express, And brightly on us shine: 2That thus thy righteous Way display'd May to the Earth be shown, And thy Salvation may be made Among the Nations known. 3O let the People, Lord, to Thee Triumphant Praises sing; Let all the People joyful be, And praise the Lord, their King. 4Your Gladness in loud Songs express Ye Nations far and wide; For God shall judge in Righteousness, And all the Kingdoms guide. 5O let the People, Lord, to Thee Triumphant Praises sing; Let all the People joyful be, And praise the Lord, their King. 6Then shall the Earth yield her Increase, Our God shall Jacob bless; 7Our God to bless us shall not cease, And all shall Him confess. Another Metre. As the XXV?? 1 Do good to Jacob's Race, To bless us Lord incline; Be merciful and make thy Face Upon thy People shine: 2That so thy wond'rous Way The Earth may understand, And thy Salvation may display Its Fame through ev'ry Land. 3Lord let the People raise Their Voice to praise thy Name; Let all the People sing thy Praise, And thy great Works proclaim. 4Glad let the Kingdoms be, And shout for Joy and sing, For Thou shalt judge them righteously, Thou of all Nations King. 5Lord let the People raise Their Voice to praise thy Name; Let all the People sing thy Praise, And thy great Works proclaim. 6The Land that we possess, Shall then yield her Increase, And God, ev'n our own God, shall bless Our Tribes with Wealth and Peace. 7With Blessings us he'll crown, And Earth's remotest Coasts, Fill'd with his wonderful Renown, Shall fear the Lord of Hosts. Psalm LXVIII. 1 Let God in awful Pow'r arise, And scatter those that hate his Name, And let his broken Enemies Fly from before his Face in Shame. 2As Smoke disperses thro' the Air, So, Lord, the Wicked shall expire; Thy Foes thy Presence shall not bear, But melt like Wax before the Fire. 3But let the Just, with one Accord, Their Minutes in Delight employ; Let them express before the Lord, The highest Marks of holy Joy. 4Sing Praise to God, his Name advance, Who rides upon the heav'nly Plains; Jah is his Name, before him dance, And shout and sing in joyful Strains. 5The Widow's righteous Judge is God, The Father of the Fatherless, Ev'n God, in his august Abode, The Mansion of his Holiness. 6Those, who of lonely Life complain, God places in a Family; He rescues Captives from their Chain, But Rebels dwell in Places dry. 7When God, their mighty Captain, led His People forth from Egypt's Land, And march'd triumphant at the Head Of Israel's Host, o'er Desart Sand. 8Before the Lord the Earth did nod, And shake with Fear, the Heav'ns did melt; Before the Lord, ev'n Israel's God, Sinai it self Convulsions felt. 9Thou from the Clouds, thy Stores on high, Didst send down plenteous Showr's of Rain, Which did thy Heritage supply, When fainting in a thirsty Plain. 10Thy People Thou did'st lead with Care, And bade them this rich Soil command, And of thy Goodness did'st prepare, For the poor Tribes, this fruitful Land. Part II. 11God gave the Matter and the Song, Which for our Vict'ry they should sing, Who met us in a num'rous Throng, And made thro' Heav'n our Triumph ring. 12Princes, by whom great Hosts are led, Shall fly, shall fly in Fight o'ercome; Women shall with the Spoil be fed, And share the Wealth, who stay at Home. 13Tho', when base Labours you did bear, Mid'st Egypt's Pots deform'd you lay, Rich Beauty you, like Doves, shall wear, That Gold and Silver Wings display. 14When God, the God of boundless Might, Did Kings in Canaan overthrow, From dark before, it grew as bright, And pure, as Salmon's whitest Snow. 15God's Hill do's high as Bashan climb, In Strength, as Bashan's Hill, excells: 16What makes you leap, ye Hills sublime? In Zion God for ever dwells. 17His Chariots twice Ten Thousand are, Angels, whose Numbers none can count; He's present with his Myriads there, As once on Sinai's holy Mount. 18On high the Lord, in Triumph rose, Captivity he Captive led; Took Gifts for Men, e'en for his Foes, That with them God might dwell their Head. 19Bless'd be the Lord, who Favours new To us most Gracious still bestows, The God of our Salvation, who Unwearied loving Kindness shows. Part III. 20To him, whom we our God alone Acknowledge, we Deliv'rance owe; From God, our Lord most high, we own Of Death the various Issues flow. 21But God in Anger shall confound The Men, who his Commands oppose; And deep his hairy Scalp shall wound, Who obstinate in Evil grows. 22Again, said God, from Bashan's King In Mercy I'll my People Save; Again the rescu'd Tribes I'll bring From the deep Ocean's yielding Wave. 23So such great Conquests Thou shalt gain O'er those thy Foes in Numbers strong, That Thou in Blood pour'd from the slain May'st dip thy Foot, and Dogs their Tongue. 24They thy Procession view'd, and saw The Pomp, that did thy March attend, When Thou, my God, did'st full of Awe, To Zion's holy Place ascend. 25The Quire of Singers led the Way, Next tuneful Instruments were heard; And Damsels, who on Timbrels play, In the long Order bright appear'd. 26Marching these Words they did express, You, who from Israel's Fountain spring, God in your Congregations bless, And magnifie the Lord, your King. 27Small Benjamin, thy Rulers high, And Judah's Princes thither went; And Zebulon and Napthali, Your Chiefs, the Triumph did augment. Part IV. 28Thy Strength by God's Appointment came, Be it to fix his Work his Care: 29Drawn by thy Temple's spreading Fame Kings shall their Off'rings thither bear. 30Rebuke the Spearmen in the Field, The People's Calves and Bulls of Might, Till they with Silver Presents yield; O blast them, who in War delight. 31 Egypt to God shall Worship pay, And Cush shall soon Oblations bring; 32O all ye Kingdoms sing and pray To Jacob's God, O praises sing. 33To him, who rides above the Sun High in the Heav'ns, his blest Abode, Stretch'd out 'ere Ancient Times begun, And spreads his mighty Voice Abroad. 34Ascribe, ye Tribes, to God most High Strength, that all other Strength outvies. On Israel, is his Majesty; His glorious Pow'r is in the Skies. 35O God, Thou greatly art renown'd From Heav'n and Zion's holy Seat; His People Jacob's God has crown'd With mighty Pow'r, God's Praise repeat. Psalm LXIX. 1 Save me, O God, for see, the Flood Breaks in, ev'n to my Soul: 2I sink in Seas and Depths of Mud, And Torrents o'er me roll. 3I'm weary with my constant Cries, Parch'd is my Throat of late; Languid and dim are my sad Eyes, While for my God I wait. 4My causeless Foes my Hairs outvie, And they excel in Might, Who would destroy my Soul, then I, For Peace, gave up my Right. 5My Trespasses, which I confess, To Thee are all reveal'd, O Lord, Thou seest my Foolishness, Nor are my Sins conceal'd. 6Lord God of Hosts, let not the Just For my sake hang their Head; Nor they, O Israel's God, who trust In Thee with Shame be spread. 7Because for Thee I suffer'd Blame, Contempt on me was thrown; 8I to my Brethren strange became, And to my Friends, unknown. 9Zeal for thy House has me devour'd, I'm eaten up with Care, And the Reproaches on Thee pour'd I did afflicted bear. Part II. 10When Tears I vented from my Eyes Kept chast'ning Fasts, and mourn'd, Behold this Grief, these Tears and Sighs To my Reproach were turn'd. 11I for my Garment Sackcloth us'd, A Proverb I was long, 12I by the Judges am abus'd, And made the Drunkard's Song. 13But as for me, I'll seek the Lord, At Times when he will hear; As Thou art faithful to thy Word, And merciful give ear. 14To my Deliv'rance, Lord, attend, Nor make the. Mire my Grave; From them, that hate me, me defend, And from deep Waters save. 15Do not the swelling Flood permit, Or Deep, that threat'ning flows, To swallow me, nor let the Pit Her Mouth upon me close. 16Thine Ear to my Petition bow, Good is thy Kindness found; Turn to thy Servant, Lord, for Thou In Mercy do'st abound. 17Hide not thy Face, for sore I grieve, With speed my Trouble hear; 18That thou from Foes may'st me relieve, Lord, to my Soul draw near. 19The Shame and Slanders I endur'd, O Lord, are in thy Eye; The Foes, which my Disgrace procur'd, Before Thee open lye. Part III. 20Reproach has broke my heavy Heart, I'm sad, I look'd around For some who Comfort might impart, I look'd, but none I found. 21For Meat, that might my Hunger sink, To bring me Gall they flew; They gave me Vinegar to drink, When pain'd I thirsty grew. 22O let their Table, richly spread, Become their Snare and Sin, And what should Joy and Peace have bred, Turn to a fatal Gin. 23Their blasted Eyes let Darkness drown, Disarm their Loins of Pow'r; 24Send thou thy Indignation down, Let Wrath their Souls devour. 25Their Mansions and their Tents lay waste, For they his Pain promote 26Whom thou hast scourg'd, and on them cast Reproach, whom thou hast smote. 27Let them repeat Iniquity, On Evil Evil raise; Nor let their Minds inlighten'd be To find thy righteous Ways. 28Ne'er let the Book of Life the Name Of such recorded hold, Nor with the Just of spotless Fame, Lord, let them be enroll'd. 29But I am poor and sorrowful, In Depths of Woe I lie; Lord, thence let thy Salvation pull, And set me up on high. Part IV. 30In Songs to praise the Lord above, I thankful will engage; 31This will to God more grateful prove Than Bullocks ripe of Age. 32This to the Just shall Joy impart, Who my Deliv'rance see; And Comfort shall revive their Heart, O God, who trust in Thee. 33Our gracious God will hear the Cries Of his afflicted Poor; Nor will the Pris'ner's Voice despise, Who do's his Name adore. 34O let the Earth, and Heav'ns above, The Ocean, and the Air, And all that in them live and move, Jehovah's Praise declare. 35For God will give to Zion Rest, And Judah's Cities build, To be by Jacob's Race possest, And with his People fill'd. 36And here his Servant's favour'd Seed In lasting Peace shall reign, And they, who love his Name shall freed From Trouble here remain. Psalm LXX. 1 Lord, haste to my Deliv'rance make, To help me speed thy Flight; 2Confound them, who my Life would take, And in my Hurt delight. 3Let them turn back and routed fly, Their shameful Deeds reward, Who did, aha, insulting cry, And no Reproaches spar'd. 4Let it their Joy and Triumph prove, Who in the Lord confide, Say ye, who his Salvation love, Let God be magnify'd. 5To me afflicted, poor, and low, Make haste, O God, I pray; Thou my Deliv'rer help bestow, O Lord, make no Delay. Psalm LXXI. 1 In Thee, O Lord, I put my Trust, With Shame ne'er cover me; 2Deliver me, for thou art just, Hear, save, and set me free. 3Be thou my strong Abode, O Lord, To which I may resort; To save me thou hast giv'n thy Word; Thou art my Rock and Fort. 4Me from the wicked Hand defend, The cruel and unjust; 5For Lord, my Hopes on Thee depend, Ev'n from my Youth my Trust. 6Thou from the Womb hast me sustain'd, Whence Thou did'st set me free; And since such Mercies I have gain'd, I'll still sing Praise to Thee. 7A Wonder I am grown of Woe, But God's my pow'rful Stay; 8His Praises from my Mouth shall flow, I'll honour Him all Day. 9From me thy Favour do not take, When I am Old and Frail; Do not thy Servant, Lord, forsake, When Mind and Body fail. Part II. 10See, my malignant Enemies, Lies to defame me make; And my Destruction to devise, Together Counsel take. 11His God will now no more, they cry, His hateful Cause assert; Then to assault him let us fly, None can the Blow avert. 12Be not far off, my God, make haste, To save me Succour send; 13Consume my mortal Foes, and blast All, who my Hurt intend. 14But still thy Goodness, Lord, shall raise My Hope, and me restore; I Thee will glorifie, and praise Thy Name, yet more and more. 15I thy Salvation all the Day, And Righteousness will show; Exprest in such a various Way, I can't their Number know. 16I'll enter on this Task with Care, And first thy Pow'r make known; I will to all, O Lord, declare Thy Justice, thine alone. Part III. 17Lord, Thou by Lessons manifold, My early Youth has taught, And hitherto have I extoll'd The Wonders Thou hast wrought: 18Forsake me not, now old and grey, Till I thy Arm have shown; Till I thy Strength to this display, And Ages yet unknown. 19Thy Righteousness is very high, Thy Deeds unrivall'd are; With Thee, Jehovah, who can vie? His Pow'r with thine compare? 20Thou, who did'st make me Trouble know, Again shalt quicken me; From Earth's low Caves, and Depths of Woe, Shall I be brought by Thee. 21My Honour Thou shalt higher raise, And me with Comforts crown; 22With Psalt'ry, Harp, thy Truth I'll praise, O Israel's Holy One! 23My Soul, which Thou hast sav'd, shall bless With joyful Shouts thy Name. 24All Day I'll tell thy Righteousness, Who put'st my Foes to Shame. Psalm. LXXII. 1 Give to the King thy Wisdom's Light, Thy Justice to his Son; 2So shall he judge the People right, And help th' aflicted one, 3The Mountains, with the Fruits of Peace, Shall the glad People bless; The little Hills the like Increase Shall yield by Righteousness. 4He'll to the Poor see Justice done, And break th' Oppressour's Might; 5As long they'll fear Thee, as the Sun And Moon shall give their Light. 6From Heav'n his Influence shall drop, As on mown Meads the Rain, And as sweet Show'rs, to raise the Crop, Descend, and drench the Plain. 7The Man, that follows Righteousness, Shall flourish in his Days; And plenteous Peace the Land shall bless, 'Till quite the Moon decays. 8From Sea to Sea, this King shall send; To all, his high Command, And from Euphrates to the End Of Palestina's Land. 9Nor shall they in the Wilderness Their Sands and Mountains trust, But bow, Subjection to express, And prostrate lick the Dust. 10The Kings of Tarshish and the Isles, With Gifts shall court the King; Sheba's and Seba's Lords shall Spoils, For Presents, to him bring. 11All Princes shall his Subjects grow, All Nations Him obey; 12For He the destitute and low Will succour when they pray. Part II. 13He'll spare the Needy and the Poor, And save them by his Might; 14Their Lives, which He'll from Force secure, Are precious in his Sight. 15And He shall live, and Sheba's Gold Men to the King shall pay; He constantly shall be extoll'd, And pray'd for ev'ry Day. 16Of Corn, an handful sown, shall crown So thick the Mountain's Brows, The Ears shall shake like Lebanon, When to the Wind it bows. And they, within the City Wall, Like Grass shall be increast. 17His Name shall ever live, and all Shall bless Him, and be blest. 18Still the Lord God, who's pleas'd to own The House of Israel, praise; Who do's the Things perform alone, That Admiration raise. 19Ye People, his exalted Name For ever glorify; Thro' all the Earth be heard his Fame; Amen, Amen, reply. Psalm LXXIII. 1 God surely is to Israel good, And all the Pure in Heart; 2But, as for me, I doubtful stood, Almost aside did start. 3To see the Fool and Wicked blest, I did with Envy swell: 4No Plagues, 'till Death, do them molest, But in full Strength they dwell. 5They seldom are, like others, found In Trouble or in Pain: 6Hence Pride and Violence surround Them, as a Vest or Chain. 7Their Eyes start out with Fat o'ergrown, They've more than Heart's Content; 8They are corrupt, Oppression own, And lofty Speeches vent. 9Against the Heav'ns their Mouths they set, The Heav'ns God's blest Abode; And thro' the Earth they shameless let Their Tongues run loose abroad. 10To these return the Tribes around, And in their Vices sink; And from a Cup with Plenty crown'd Full Draughts of Pleasure drink. 11Now with blaspheming Lips they cry, How do's th' Almighty know? Do's He, that dwells in Heav'n on High, Observe what's done below? 12Behold, this wicked Race are they, Whose Days are blest with Peace; Who prosper, and with Joy can say, Our Pow'r and Wealth increase. 13Sure I with Care have purg'd my Heart, And cleans'd my Hands in vain; 14All Day I've suffer'd grievous Smart, Each Morn chastising Pain. 15But that, which now I rashly say, Should I as Truth declare, I should their righteous Cause betray, Who thy true Children are. Part II. 16To know this, when my Thoughts were bent, I found the Task too hard; 17Till to thy Holy Place I went, And that their End declar'd. 18Sure they on slipp'ry Ground were plac'd, By Thee to Ruin doom'd; 19How suddainly are they laid waste? With Terrours how consum'd? 20See, as a Dream, when one awakes, So all their Glory dies; When God his Seat to judge them takes, He shall their Pomp despise. 21Thus at my Heart did Sorrow lie, My Reins were sore opprest; 22So dull and ignorant was I, Ev'n as a stupid Beast. 23Yet always I with Thee abide, Who me thy Care do'st make; 24Me with thy Counsel Thou wilt guide, And then to Glory take. 25Who is there, Lord, in Heav'n above, But Thee, that I require? On Earth below, whom can I love, And like thy Self desire? 26My Flesh has quite consum'd its Stock, My Heart is troubled sore; But God is of my Heart the Rock, My Portion evermore. 27For they, who are estrang'd from Thee, Shall perish in their Way; Thou mad'st them Desolation see, Who go from Thee astray. 28But Freedom to approach Thee nigh, My Soul with Pleasure feeds; I plac'd my Trust in God, that I Might tell of all thy Deeds. Psalm LXXIV. 1 What do's the Lord so much provoke To cast us off, his Tribes of old? What causes thy fierce Wrath to smoke Against thy own peculiar Fold? 2Regard thy Purchase, Jacob's Race, This Tribe, this Heritage thy own, Redeem'd and blest with Marks of Grace, Ev'n this Mount Zion, once thy Throne. 3With speedy Feet to save us run, Thy Help our Desolations need; From Wrongs, which wicked Foes have done, Lord, let thy holy Place be freed. 4Thy shouting Foes possess thy Gates, And triumph, where thy People met; On high prevailing Potentates Proud Banners, Signs of Conquest, set. 5A Man, that fell'd the Trees thick Rows, To build the Temple, gain'd Renown; 6But now the Hammers of our Foes, And Axes break the carv'd Work down. 7Thy sacred House they did deface, And with devouring Flames confound; They have defil'd thy dwelling Place, And laid it level with the Ground. 8They in their Hearts, said, out of Hand Let us this People quite destroy: They did their Troops thro' all the Land, To burn our Synagogues employ. 9We now behold the sacred Signs Of God's blest Presence here no more; No Prophet warns us, none divines When God will our lost State restore. Part II. 10How long shall they, who God oppose, With vile Reproaches him defame? For ever shall his impious Foes Reflect Dishonour on his Name? 11O, wherefore do'st thou draw away Thy Hand, O Lord ev'n thy right Hand? Forth from thy Bosom pull it, slay The wicked Race, who Thee withstand. 12For God has been my King of old, Whose Pow'r has great Salvation wrought, Thro' Ages in Succession roll'd, In this, and all the Realms remote. 13Thou did'st the Seas extended Beds By thy resistless Strength divide, And of the Crocodiles the Heads Thy Vengeance broke amid'st the Tide. 14Thou did'st Leviathan suppress, And gav'st his mighty Limbs a Prey, To People, that the Woods possess, And o'er the howling Desart stray. 15As in the thirsty Wilderness Thou did'st the weeping Rock divide, Whence issuing Streams did Jacob bless, So thou hast mighty Rivers dry'd. Part III. 16Thine is the Day, the Night is thine, Thou hast the Sun and Moon display'd; 17Thou to the Realms dost Bounds assign, Summer and Winter thou hast made. 18Remember, that the impious School, Ev'n scoffing Foes thy Ways condemn'd; And that the proud, immoral Fool Thy Name, Jehovah, has blasphem'd. 19O, never give thy Turtle Dove To Men of Violence a Prey; Nor from thy Thoughts the Poor remove, Who helpless thy Protection pray. 20Respect thy Covenant, O God, That Canaan may by us be till'd, For these dark Places, our Abode, With Rapine and with Blood are fill'd. 21Let not th' Oppress'd thy Silence mourn, Nor when they seek Thee, suffer Shame; Nor e'er unheard from Thee return, Still let the Needy praise thy Name. 22To argue thy own Cause arise, See, how the Fool Reproaches throws; 23Observe th' insulting Enemies, Their Tumult daily higher grows. Psalm LXXV. 1 We offer Thanks to God on high, For Thee we Songs prepare; That Thou to succour us art nigh, Thy wond'rous Works declare. 2When I th' appointed Time shall take To guide the gather'd Tribes, My Rule of Government I'll make, What Equity prescribes. 3The Land, and all its People wear, Dissolve, and melt away; And did not I its Pillars bear, It wholly would decay. 4I bade the Fool from Folly fly, The Proud their Pride restrain, 5Nor let them lift their Horn on High, Nor utter Speeches vain. 6From North or South, from East or West, Deliv'rance will not come: 7God is the Judge, some are deprest By Him, and rais'd are some. 8God holds of red mixt Wine a Bowl, To each his Share do's pour; But the strong Dreggs wrung out the Soul Of all his Foes devour. 9But I'll extoll and ever praise The God of Jacob's Race; 10The Just to Honour I will raise, And impious Men debase. Another Metre. As the CXIII. 1 We thank Thee, thank Thee, God most high, For that thy mighty Pow'r is nigh, Plainly thy wond'rous Works confess; 2When I the Assembly shall regain, I Laws impartial will ordain, And Justice shall my People bless. 3The Earth and each Inhabitant Dissolve with Fear, and Succour want, But I its shaking Pillars bear; 4I said to Fools, from Folly fly, And to th' Unjust, no more on high Lift proudly up your Horn in Air. 5Do not lift up on high your Horn, Nor speak with Arrogance and Scorn, But from your boastful Words refrain; 6For turn to East, or West, or North, Or to the Southern Hills go forth, You'll hope to scape God's Wrath in vain. 7God is the Judge, who can with Ease Sink Men or raise them, as He please; 8For in his Hand there is a Cup Of red mixt Wine, and of it All Shall taste, but Dreggs wrung out, like Gall, Shall by the Wicked be drunk up. 9But this for ever I'll declare, And Praises sing with pious Care, To God whilst I remain alive; 10And of the proud ungodly Race The lofty Horns I will debase, But those of righteous Men shall thrive. Psalm LXXVI. 1 Th' Almighty is in Judah known, His Name's in Israel great; 2In Salem is his holy Throne, And Zion is his Seat. 3Here breaks he Arrows, Shields and Swords, And Battles in Array; 4Thou art more glorious than the Lords, Who Mountains are of Prey. 5Now are their Warriours bold in Fight, Of Booty gain'd berest; In Death they slept, no Men of Might To lift the Hand were left. 6Pale Charioteers and Horsemen shook, And fell, no more to rise; O, Jacob's God, at thy Rebuke Dead Sleep seal'd up their Eyes. 7Thou, Lord, ev'n Thou do'st Fear command, By thy resistless Might; When Thou art angry, who can stand Undaunted in thy Sight! 8From Heav'n thy Terrours were declar'd, The Nations aw'd grew still; 9When God to Judgment came to guard The Meek, that do his Will. 10Thou Praise from wrathful Men, that rose Against Thee, shalt obtain; The Remnant of thy angry Foes Thy Pow'r shall sure restrain. 11Vow to the Lord your God and King, And pay your solemn Vow; Ye Nations to Him Presents bring, To whom all Pow'rs should bow. 12He Lords and Chiefs of mighty States Shall utterly destroy; He Terrour in their Hearts creates, Who princely Pow'r enjoy. Psalm LXXVII. 1 To God I Supplication made, And with my Voice I cry'd When Troubles did my Soul invade, And he with me comply'd. 2I sought the Lord in my sad Day, And while I wak'd by Night, With Hands spread forth still did I pray, My Soul did Comfort slight. 3I, when I thought of God, was pain'd, Who once was my Relief; And when in Anguish I complain'd, My Pray'r encreas'd my Grief. 4Thou do'st my Eye-lids waking hold, I faint, and speechless grow; 5And well I weigh'd th' Events of Old To mitigate my Woe. 6The Songs, which in thy Praise I made, I call to Mind by Night; Thy Dealings in my Heart I weigh'd, And search'd instructive Light. 7For ever shall thy Wrath prevail? No more will God relent? 8For ever shall thy Promise fail? Are all thy Mercies spent? 9Has God forgotten to be kind? Do's he so angry grow, That he his Mercies has confin'd, That they no more shall flow? 10I said, these anxious Doubts and Fears Rise from distemper'd Thought, I'll weigh the Deeds of former Years, Which God's Right Hand has wrought. 11I'll keep thy Works in Memory, Thy Wonders done of old; 12My Contemplation they shall be, Nor shall they be untold. Part II. 13Thy Ways oft dark, tho' just and wise, Thy holy Place explains; What God with ours in Greatness vies, Or so exalted reigns? 14Thou art the God, who dost delight By Wonders to be known; Thou hast thy matchless Strength and Might To all the People shown. 15By thy strong Arm Thou did'st restore Thy People, Jacob's Seed, And Joseph from proud Egypt's Shore, And Bondage Thou hast freed. 16The Waters saw Thee, Lord, the Flood Of Waters saw, and fear'd; The Depths profound astonish'd stood, When God in Pow'r appear'd. 17Th' assembled Clouds pour'd Waters out, Sounds from the Skies were sent; Amazing Sounds, while all about Thy peircing Arrows went. 18Thy Voice thro' troubled Fields of Air In Thunder roar'd around; The Lightnings spread their flashing Glare, And shook the trembling Ground. 19Thou thro' the Sea do'st make a Way, Where not a Path is shown: The mighty Waters Thee obey, Nor are thy Footsteps known. 20By Moses and by Aaron's Hands, Thou, Lord, thy People's Head, Thro' raging Gulphs and desart Lands, Thy Flock hast safely led. Psalm LXXVIII. 1 My People you your selves profess, Therefore my Law obedient hear, And to the Words my Lips express, Attentively incline your Ear. 2Events important I will shew, Things dark by Length of Time unfold; 3Which we have heard, and known are true, And which our faithful Fathers told. 4We from their Sons will not conceal The Triumphs by Jehovah won; We will his mighty Strength reveal, And the great Wonders by him done. 5For He a Statute did ordain, And fix'd a Law in Israel's State, 6That Sons unborn might in a Train, His Works from Age to Age relate. 7That they their Hope in God might set, Their Trust on his try'd Mercy lay; Nor e'er his mighty Deeds forget, Or sacred Precepts disobey. 8And might not like their Father's Race, Rebellious, proud and stubborn prove, Who did their Hearts on Evil place, Nor stedfast were to God their Love. 9The Sons of Ephraim arm'd with Bows, Did in the Day of Battle fly; 10They broke their Word and solemn Vows, And did to keep his Laws deny. Part II. 11To Disobedience still inclin'd They shew'd they had his Works forgot; The mighty Works of sundry Kind, Which in their Favour God had wrought. 12Things which Astonishment create, Th' Almighty did by his Right Hand, And Wonders, in their Father's Sight, On Zoan's Field in Egypt's Land. 13The raging Billows of the Main Divided at his high Command; And that the Tribes might Passage gain, He made in Heaps the Waters stand. 14He with a shelt'ring Cloud by Day His people up from Egypt led, And did by Night, to shew their Way, A Light of Fire before them spread. 15God in the thirsty Desart clave The Rocks, with wonder-working Force; 16And Drink in great abundance gave, While Streams like Rivers took their Course. 17In the wild Sands they sinn'd yet more, Provoking God by vile Distrust; 18And tempted him amidst their Store, By asking Meat to please their Lust. 19Reproachful Words of God they said, And did his Truth and Pow'r arraign; Can he a plenteous Table spread, They cry, in this unfruitful Plain? 20He smote the Rock, outgush'd the Spring, Sweet Streams the Land did overflow, But can he Bread to Jacob bring, And from his Treasures Flesh bestow? Part III. 21God heard, was wroth, a Fire most just Against all Israel kindled rose; 22For they believ'd not God, nor Trust In his Salvation would repose. 23Tho' to the Clouds he gave command To set their Doors and Sluces free; 24Then rain'd down Manna on the Land, And Corn from Heav'ns rich Granary. 25Man was refresh'd with wond'rous Meat, With most refin'd and pleasant Bread, Which from the distant Skies, the Seat Of Angels, on the Earth was shed. 26From the South-east he bade the Wind Blow in the Heav'ns, whence Flesh he pour'd, 27Flesh thick as Dust for Food design'd, And feather'd Fowls, like Sand, he showr'd. 28The falling Meat did overspread Their Camp, and all their Tents around; 29They eat, and were to Fulness fed, For God their utmost Wishes crown'd. 30They persever'd still in their Lust; But while their Meat pass'd down their Throat, 31They felt God's Arm, whose Vengeance just The Strongest and the Chosen smote: 32Nor did they yet from Sin refrain, Nor could his Works Conviction raise; 33Hence he consum'd in Wand'rings vain Their Years, and in Distress their Days. Part IV. 34They sought th' Almighty, when involv'd In Storms of Wrath, and Succour pray'd; To leave their evil Ways resolv'd, And after God Inquiry made. 35They now remember'd that their Rock, And Saviour was the Lord most high; 36Yet flatt'ring they their God did mock, And worship'd with a hateful Lye. 37For Constancy they still did want, Nor were their Hearts to God sincere; Nor to their solemn Covenant Did they with Faithfulness adhere. 38Yet graciously their Sin's Desert He pardon'd, nor their Race distroy'd; He oft his Anger did avert, Nor once his utmost Wrath employ'd. 39Compassionate He call'd to Mind They were but Flesh, and soon would fall; A Vapour, or a Blast of Wind, That none, when vanish'd, can recall. 40How oft his Anger did they raise, And grieve his Soul in Lands unknown? 41Murm'ring they tempted God, and Ways Prescrib'd to Israel's Holy One. 42They did not keep in Mind, nor lay To Heart the Wonders of his Hand, And that renown'd Salvation-Day, When they were freed from Pharoah's Land. Part V. 43How God his Signs in Egypt wrought, Which Fear and Admiration yield, And how his Might Deliv'rance brought, By Wonders done in Zoan's Field. 44How he converted into Blood The Rivers that refresh'd the Soil, And all their Streams and ev'ry Flood, Till none could drink them, did defile. 45He rais'd unnumber'd Swarms of Flies, And his wing'd Host on Egypt pour'd, Whence Plagues contagious did arise, While Frogs thro' all the Land devour'd. 46The Caterpillar had for Meat Th' increasing Offspring of the Soil, And Locusts numberless did eat Their Harvest, and devour'd their Toil. 47Their Fig-trees and their Vines were lost, Beat down by pond'rous Show'rs of Hail; The Sycomores by Cold and Frost, Their blasted Beauty did bewail. 48To Storms of icy Stones He gave Their num'rous Flocks, that graze the Hill, Nor from his Thunder could they save The Herds, that did the Vally fill. 49For on them hot Displeasure He Fierce Wrath and Indignation cast, By evil Angels Ministry, He vex'd and laid their Country waste. Part VI. 50Intent on Vengeance He prepar'd, To his just Rage, a ready Way; Nor the vile Stock from Ruin spar'd, But gave them to his Plagues a Prey. 51His Angel did, at his Command, Destruction on the First-Born pour, Thro' all the Towns of Eygpt's Land, Of Ham's curs'd Race, the Strength and Flow'r. 52But He, his People led like Sheep, His Flock thro' all the howling Waste; 53And did their Sons in Safety keep, Whilst o'er their Foes the Ocean past. 54The Tribes He to the Border brought Of his peculiar holy Land; This Land of Mountains, where He fought, And Conquest gain'd by his Right-hand. 55He took the Field on Jacob's Side, And did the heathen Pow'rs expell; Then did by Line their Lots divide, And in their Tents make Israel dwell. 56Yet still they tempted God most High, Nor did his righteous Laws obey; 57Truth, like their Fathers, they deny, Like a false Bow they turn'd away. Part VII. 58Him their high Places did displease, And made his kindling Anger glow, And by their Graven Images He did enrag'd and jealous grow. 59God heard, was wroth, and Israel's Race Abhor'd, and Shiloh he forsook, 60 Shiloh, his known abiding Place, And of his Tent his Farewell took. 61His Strength and Glory then the Lord To proud Philistia captive made; 62Gave up his People to the Sword, And did in Rage his Lot invade. 63Now were their Youth by Fire consum'd, Nor was the Virgin made a Bride; 64The guilty Priests to Slaughter doom'd Unpity'd by their Widows dy'd. 65At length the Lord our God awakes, As one, that do's his Bed resign, Or one, that Strength and Courage takes, Inflam'd by Draughts of gen'rous Wine. 66The Heathens Hinder-parts He smote, Which gave them Pain and endless Shame; 67Nor did He Joseph's Pow'r promote, Nor Ephraim, as his Fav'rite, Name. 68But He the Tribe of Judah chose, The Mountain Zion, which He lov'd: 69On High his Holy Temple rose, And as the Earth will stand unmov'd. 70He did his Servant David chuse, And from the Sheepfold took the King; 71Whom God, from tending pregnant Ewes, To feed his chosen Tribes did bring. 72So with Integrity of Heart, He fed them, and their Wants supply'd; And by a watchful Ruler's Art Their Nation with Success did guide. Psalm LXXIX. 1 The Conqu'ring Heathens, Lord, advance, Their Arms to thy Inheritance; Thy Holy Seat they have defil'd, And Salem's beauteous City spoil'd. 2Thy Servants Bodies they have giv'n, Meat to the rav'ning Birds of Heav'n; And of thy Saints the Flesh did yield To Beasts of Prey, that range the Field. 3Their flowing Blood, like Waters shed About Jerusalem was spread; And while their Dead lay on the Ground, See, none to bury them were found. 4Reproach our Neighbours on us throw, While we the Scoffer's Subject grow. 5Still shall thy Wrath new Heat acquire; Thy jealous Rage still burn like Fire? 6With Floods of Fury whelm them o'er, Who do not Israel's God adore; And let the Realms with Plagues be fill'd, Who to thy Name no Altar build. 7For they have Wrath on Jacob pour'd, And cruelly his Seed devour'd: They have his harrass'd Land defac'd, And laid his Habitation waste. 8Past Errours, Lord, remember not, And be our heinous Crimes forgot: Make haste, thy tender Mercies show, For we are brought down very low. Part II. 9Help, Lord of our Salvation, grant, For thy own Glory, Help we want: Deliver us, and for the Love Of thy great Name our Guilt remove. 10Why, where's their God do Heathens cry? Amid'st the Realms before our Eye, Let him be known by Vengeance spread For Israel's Blood, which they have shed. 11Lord, to the Pris'ner bow thy Ear, Wipe off his Tears, his Sighing hear; Keep them who in Captivity Are yet unsafe, nor let them Dy. 12Reviling Neighbours, Lord, requite Sev'n-fold for their malignant Spite: Pour on them that reproach and blame, Which they have cast on thy great Name. 13So we thy People, Jacob's Seed, The Sheep that on thy Pasture feed, For ever will our Thanks express, And Thee thro' endless Ages bless. Psalm LXXX. 1 Shepherd of Israel, who do'st guide Joseph thy Flock, give Ear; Who mid'st the Cherubs do'st reside, Shine forth, and bright appear. 2Before Manasseh, Benjamin, And Ephraim, Jacob's Seed, Stir up thy Strength, thy March begin, Come save us, Lord, with Speed. 3Turn us again, and let thy Face For our Salvation shine; 4How long, O Lord, will be the Space 'Ere Thou thy Ear incline? 5With Tears for Bread Thou feed'st our Life, For Drink do'st Tears impose; 6To Neighbours we are made a Strife, And Laughter to our Foes. 7Turn us, Lord God of Hosts, we pray, And we'll thy Praises sing; The Glories of thy Face display, Which will Salvation bring. 8Thou mov'd'st a Vine, in Egypt found, To Lands whence Heathens fled; 9It took deep Root in labour'd Ground, And did the Realm o'erspread. 10The Hills were cover'd with its Shade, Its Head, like Cedars, rose; 11These Boughs it to the Sea convey'd, And to Euphrates those. 12Why then her Fence did'st Thou confound, And her high Hedges tear, That all, who now pass by, may wound Her Limbs, and make her bare? 13The Savage Boar, that haunts the Wood, O'er runs and lays it waste; By Beasts, that range the Field for Food, Th' Enclosure is defac'd. Part II. 14Lord God of Hosts return, we pray, Thy Ear to us incline; Look down well pleas'd from Heav'n, survey And visit this thy Vine. 15Regard the Vineyard in our Land, Planted by thy great Might; Regard the Branch by thy Right Hand Made strong for thy Delight. 16Behold thy Vine is burnt with Fire, Her Branches are cut down; Thy People languish and expire By thy rebuking Frown. 17Stretch forth thy Hand, and let it aid The Man of thy Right Hand, The Son of Man, whom thou hast made Strong for thy Self to stand. 18So with distinguish'd Favours blest We will revolt no more; Revive our Souls, with Peace and Rest, And we'll thy Name adore. 19Turn us, Lord God of Hosts, we pray, And we'll thy Praises sing; The Glories of thy Face display, Which will Salvation bring. Another Metre. As the XXV. 1 O Israel's Shepherd, hear, Who Joseph's Flock hast led, Who 'mid'st the Cherubs dost appear, Abroad thy Glory spread. 2Come save us in the Sight Of Ephriam, Benjamin, Manasseh, Lord, shew forth thy Might, Which they have often seen. 3Turn us, O God, again, Thy Face, Lord, let us see, And when that Favour we obtain, We shall deliver'd be. 4Lord God of Hosts, O say, How long must we despair? How long wilt Thou thy Wrath display Deaf to thy People's Pray'r? 5Thou giv'st them Tears for Bread, Abundant Tears for drink; 6To Neighbours we a Strife are made; Foes laugh to see us sink. 7Turn us, O God, again, Thy Face, Lord, let us see, And when that Favour we obtain, We shall deliver'd be. 8Thou mov'd'st a chosen Vine To this, from Egypt's Land, Drov'st out the Heathen with Design To plant it with thy Hand. 9Fit Room Thou did'st prepare And mad'st it take deep Root, It flourish'd by thy tender Care, And fill'd the Land with Fruit. 10Her Shade the Hills did hide, Like Cedars grew her Head; 11From Midland Seas her Branches wide Did to Euphrates spread. 12Why did'st Thou level lay Her Fence, her Hedges tare, That all, that pass along the Way, May pluck and make her bare? 13The Boar, that do's infest The Wood, roots up her Soil; And of the Field the Salvage Beast Devours the Lab'rer's Toil. Part II. 14Return, O God, we pray, To us thy Ear incline; Look down from Heav'n, O Lord; survey And visit this thy Vine, 15And Vineyard open laid, Tho' planted by thy Might, And the chief Branch, which Thou hast made Strong for thy own Delight. 16Fire has her Boughs consum'd, Great Numbers are cut down; They are by Wrath to ruin doom'd, And perish at thy Frown. 17The Man of thy Right Hand Still succour with thy Aid; The Son of Man, whom to withstand Thy Foes, Thou strong hast made. 18So we will never more Go back, O God, from Thee; But will thy Name alone adore, Do Thou but set us free. 19Turn us, O God, again, Thy Face, Lord, let us see, And when that Favour we obtain, We shall deliver'd be. Psalm LXXXI. 1 Sing to the Lord, our Strength aloud, Aloft your Voices raise; The Lord, who Love to Jacob vow'd, With Shouts of Triumph praise. 2Sing Psalms, your Joy let Timbrels show, On Harp and Psalt'ry play; 3In the New Moon the Trumpet blow, Th' appointed feasting Day. 4This Law by Jacob's God was taught, And did a Custom grow, 5When He our Tribes from Egypt brought, Whose Speech we did not know. 6In Mercy I, his Shoulders pain'd With heavy Burdens, eas'd, And his gaul'd Hands, which long sustain'd Vile Labour, I releas'd. 7Thou call'd'st; thy Trouble I remov'd, Which I with Pity saw; In Thunder I reply'd, and prov'd Thy Truth at Meribah. Part II. 8Give Ear, my People, Jacob's House, What I pronounce, record; 9Thou shalt no Foreign God espouse, Adore no Stranger Lord. 10I am thy God, that thro' the Tide Brought Thee from Egypt's Shore; Then let thy Mouth be open'd wide, I'll fill it with my Store. 11But Israel would not hear my Voice, Nor would my Will obey; 12I gave them then their fatal Choice, And left them to their Way. 13O, that My People me had heard, And walk'd by my Command, 14I soon against the Foes, they fear'd, Had turn'd my conqu'ring Hand. 15To them, from those that hate the Lord, I Homage had procur'd, But they, while they their God ador'd, For ever had endur'd. 16I would have fill'd them with a Stock Of finest wheaten Bread, And with the Honey from the Rock, In Plenty would have fed. Another Metre. As the L. 1 Loud Strains employ In Praise to God, our Might, In Shouts of Joy To Jacob's God unite. 2Praise Off'rings make, The Timbrel hither bring; The Psalt'ry take, And Harp of pleasant String. 3In the New Moon The Trumpet blow, and play On Fifes, and tune Your Harps on this high Day. 4This Statute known Was made for Israel's Seed, A Law, we own By Jacob's God decreed. 5In Joseph's Band He this Memorial reer'd, Passing Ham's Land, Where Speech unknown I heard. 6My high Commands His burthen'd Back reliev'd, And eas'd his Hands With sordid Labour griev'd. 7Thou call'dst, with Awe In Thunder I reply'd, At Meribah Again thy Sons I try'd; Part II. 8My People now Hear, I'll my Will display, If Israel Thou Wilt hearken and obey. 9Of no strange God Thou shalt the Aid implore, Nor from Abroad God's hither brought adore. 10Thy God and Guide I Thee from Egypt led; Ope thy Mouth wide, And to the full be fed. 11But with my Voice My Tribes would not agree, By impious Choice Israel rejected me. 12So to their Lust I gave them up, and they Made Lies their Trust, And walk'd in their own Way. 13O that my Will My People's Minds had sway'd, And Israel still, Had my just Laws obey'd. 14I had expell'd Their Neigh'bring Enemies, And quickly quell'd All, who against them rise. 15God's Foes at least, Submission should have feign'd, But they in Rest For ever had remain'd. 16The finest Wheat From Him they had enjoy'd, And pleasant Meat Rock-honey them had cloy'd. Psalm LXXXII. 1 See God do's in th' Assembly stand Of Men rever'd for Might, Among the Gods, that rule the Land, 'Tis He that judges right. 2How long will ye injuriously Expound the settled Laws? Pronounce unjust Decrees, and try The Person, not the Cause? 3Defend the Poor and Fatherless, Do Justice to th' Opprest; 4And from the Hand of Wickedness, The Weak and Needy wrest. 5Rulers on evil Aims intent, Walk on perversely blind; And the whole Frame of Government Is mov'd and undermin'd. 6Ye Princes, you I Gods did call, Sons of th' Lord most high; 7But you must like the Vulgar fall, Tho' Gods, like Men you'll die. 8Rise, Lord, to thy Tribunal bring, Not only Jacob's Line, But all the Earth, for Thou art King; All Nations shall be Thine. Psalm LXXXIII. 1 Lord, do not still in Silence rest, And stand unactive by; 2See, thy proud Foes the Land molest, And lift the Head on high. 3They crafty Arts to overcome Thy Kingdom have apply'd, And plot against the People, whom Thou dost as Treasure hide. 4Be it to cut them off our Aim, They did united cry, And crush their Race, that Israel's Name May unremember'd ly. 5For they, to compass their Intent, In Council Plots have laid; Against Thee they, on Mischief bent, A Covenant have made. 6Among these gather'd Potentates Were reckon'd Edom's Men, The Ishmaelite and Moab's States, Joyn'd by the Hagaren. 7The Heads of Gebal, Ammon's House, The Fierce Amalekite; Philistia's Lords their Cause espouse, With Tyre's Confed'rate Might. 8 Assur his Hate has not forgot, But with the Foe combin'd; And with th' Apostate Sons of Lot His Force and Counsels joyn'd. Part II. 9Make them as Midian's Sisera, Or Jabin, who were slain, 10On Kishon's Bank, and rotting lay, Like Dung, on Endor's Plain. 11Their Chiefs like Zeeb and Oreb quell, O'ertaken let them dy, As Zebah and Zalmunnah fell, Let their slain Princes ly. 12Who, let us seize on, (thus they spake,) Each House of God we find. 13Lord, like a Wheel them restless make, Or Chaff before the Wind. 14As raging Fires the Woods destroy, And Flames the Hills deform, 15So let thy Tempests them annoy, And drive them with thy Storm. 16May in their Looks Confusion reign, That they may seek thy Face; 17Let them for ever Shame sustain, And perish in Disgrace. 18That Men may thro' the Realms proclaim, That Thou art God most high, To whom alone this sacred Name, Jehovah, we apply. Psalm LXXXIV. 1 What Joy thy Courts, for which I long, O God of Hosts afford! 2The Pantings of my Heart are strong For Thee the Living Lord. 3The Sparrow near thy Altar dwells, There Swallows build their Nests, And lay their Young in artful Cells, My God, my Sov'raign blest. 4Thrice happy they, who make thy House, To praise Thee, their Abode, 5Who as their Strength do Thee espouse, Resolv'd on Salem's Road. 6Who, while they march thro' Baca's Plain, Wells for Refreshment sink, Also abundant Show'rs of Rain Afford the Trav'llers drink. 7Cheerful from Strength to Strength they go, Untir'd they pass the Land, For all in Zion's Hills, they know, Before their God shall stand. 8Lord God of Hosts Attention yield, Hear, Jacob's God, my Cry; 9Upon thy King, O God, our Shield, Look with a gracious Eye. 10For in thy sacred House a Day A thousand do's excell; To keep thy Door I'd rather stay, Than with the wicked dwell. 11God is a Sun to light and chear, A Buckler to defend; Glory and Grace and all things dear Shall on the Good descend. 12O Lord of Hosts, how blest is He, Who owns thy Word is Just, And firmly thence confides in Thee, Nor feeds, within, Distrust? Another Metre. 1 What Pleasure do thy Courts afford, O God of Hosts, for which I long! 2For Thee, for Thee the Living Lord, The Pantings of my Heart are strong. 3The Sparrow near thy Altar dwells, And there the Swallow builds her Nest, And lays her Young in artful Cells, My God and King for ever blest. 4Thrice happy they, who make thy House To sing thy Praise their sweet Abode; 5Who as their Strength do Thee espouse, And at their Heart have Salem's Road. 6Who, while they make their March devout Thro' Baca's Vale to Zion's Hill, Dig Wells, to ease the Trav'ller's Drought, While welcome Rains the Cisterns fill. 7Cheerful from Strength to Strength they go, Advancing with unwearied Pace; For all, before their God, they know, Shall stand in Zion's Holy Place. 8Lord, hear my Pray'r, unmix'd with Guile, O God of Jacob Succour bring; 9Behold, O Lord, our Shield, and smile Gracious on thy Anointed King. 10For in thy sacred House a Day A Thousand others do's excel; To keep its Door I'd rather stay, Than in the Tents of Riot dwell. 11God is a Sun, to light and cheer, A mighty Buckler to defend: Glory and Grace, and all Things dear Shall on the Good from Heav'n descend. 12O Lord of Hosts, how blest is he, Who is assur'd, thy Word is Just, And thence reposes Trust in Thee, Nor feeds within his Heart Distrust? Psalm LXXXV. 1 Good to thy Land, Lord, Thou hast been, Hast broken Israel's Chains; 2Kindly remov'd thy People's Sin, And cover'd all their Stains. 3Nor pleas'd thy Fury still should burn, Thou did'st its Flame appease; 4God of Salvation, Israel turn, And let thine Anger cease. 5For ever wilt Thou keep alive Thy Wrath, and still destroy? 6Wilt Thou no more our Land revive, That thou may'st be our Joy? 7Thy Mercy and Salvation show: I will to God attend; 8He'll on his People Peace bestow, Let them no more offend. 9To them Redemption sure is near, Who fear his high Command, That Glory hop'd for may appear, And dwell within the Land. 10Mercy and Faithfulness combine, And Right Embraces Love; 11Truth springing from the Earth shall shine, And justice from above. 12The Lord great Blessings shall bestow, Our Land yield her Increase; 13Before Him Righteousness shall go, Nor to attend Him cease. Psalm LXXXVI. 1 Lord, to my Pray'r bow down thy Ear, For I in Want abide; 2Preserve my Soul, for Thee I fear, And in thy Name confide. 3To Thee all Day I raise my Voice, Let me thy Mercy see; 4Lord, cause thy Servant to rejoyce, I lift my Heart to Thee. 5For Thou, O Lord, art Good, I know, And to forgive art prone, And do'st to all, great Mercy show, Who supplicate thy Throne. 6To my Petition, Lord, attend, And to my Voice give Ear; In Streights my Pray'r to Thee I'll send, And Thou my Cry wilt hear. 8None, Lord, among the Gods is found To be with Thee compar'd; No other Works can be renown'd, When, Lord, we thine regard. 9The Nations spread thro' ev'ry Land, Whom thy great Pow'r did Frame, Before Thee shall adoring stand, And glorifie thy Name. 10Thou Wonder-working God alone, Thou, Thou God mighty art. 11To me thy Way and Truth make known, And to Thee knit my Heart. Part II. 12With all my Soul I'll raise my Voice, Thy Praises to proclaim; O Lord my God, I'll still rejoyce, To spread thy glorious Fame. 13For, Lord, Thou did'st to me extend The Mercy I did crave; And thy assisting Hand did'st lend, To snatch me from the Grave. 14The proud and Rash, vain Ends to get, In Troops against me rise; They sought my Life, and have not set Thee, Lord, before their Eyes. 15But Thou, O Lord, long Suff'ring art, For Clemency renown'd, For Mercy and a tender Heart; And still art faithful found. 16To me return, shew Mercy, Lord, To me, as Thou hast done; And to thy Servant Strength afford, And save thy Hand-maid's Son. 17Express some Marks, that Thou art Kind, Which all my Foes may see; They'll be confounded, when they find My Comforts spring from Thee. Psalm LXXXVII. 1 See, the Foundations long design'd, On which the Temple fix'd shall stand, We in the holy Mountains find, Not to be mov'd from Land to Land. 2Thou, Zion, art to God a Seat, More than all Jacob's Dwellings dear; 3O City Nam'd of God, how great And glorious Things of Thee we hear? 4Of Rahab, Babel, I will say, To them, who Me Jehovah know, Of Tyrus, Cush, Philistia, they Birth to this Holy City owe. 5And this of Zion shall be said, That Multitudes are in her Born; And He, the Lord most High, her Head Shall her establish and adorn. 6When of his Saints, God shall demand The Number writ, and count his Fold, The People of each distant Land, Shall as her Natives be enroll'd. 7There to proclaim thy Praise, shall be Singers, as well as those, that play On tuneful Instruments; in Thee Are all my Springs, that Joy convey. Psalm LXXXVIII. 1 O God, my Saviour, I have cry'd Before Thee Night and Day; 2Let not my Pray'r, Lord, be deny'd, But to my Cry give Way. 3My Soul in Storms of Grief is lost, To Death I'm drawing on; 4My Friends have yielded me as lost, For all my Strength is gone. 5The Dead their own acknowledge me, I with the Slain compare; I'm of the Grave accounted free, No longer now thy Care. 6I'm plung'd in lowest Depths of Woe, My Soul in Darkness raves; 7Thy Wrath lies hard, while o'er me flow All thy afflicting Waves. 8My scar'd Acquaintance from me fly, A Sight of Horrour made; Shut up as in a Tomb I ly, To walk Abroad afraid. 9I swim in Tears, which from my Grief And deep Affliction rise; With outstretch'd Hands I've beg'd Relief, When wilt Thou hear my Cries? Part II. 10In the black Regions to the Dead, Lord, wilt Thou Wonders show? Shall they revive, and rise to spread Thy Triumphs here below? 11Thy Goodness shall the Grave recite? Silence thy Truth proclaim? 12Shall Darkness Songs of Praise indite? Oblivion spread thy Fame? 13But as for me, Lord, constant Cries I to thy Throne have sent; 'Ere yet the Sun reveals the Skies My Pray'r shall Thee prevent. 14Why do'st Thou cast thy Servant down, And cloath me with Disgrace? Why do'st Thou, Lord, in Anger frown, And hide from me thy Face? 15Up from my Youth I near the Grave Abide, I am distress'd; I Mourn, and in Distraction rave, While by thy Wrath oppress'd. 16Thy Fury o'er me whelms its Tide, Thy Terrours me confound; 17They shut me up on ev'ry Side, And like great Floods surround. 18My Friends and Lovers in Affright Far from my Presence run; Thy Servant, now a fearful Sight, My old Acquaintance shun. Psalm LXXXIX. 1 Thy Mercies, Lord, shall be my Song And Theme of endless Praise; I will proclaim thy Truth, as long As Time has coming Days. 2For I have said, for ever Love, And Mercy shall remain; Thou wilt as firm, as Heav'n above, Thy Faithfulness maintain. 3I in a sacred Covenant To David Witness bore, That I would ratify my Grant, I to my Servant Swore. 4Thy House for ever I will build, And ever fix thy Throne; 5The Heav'ns shall with thy Praise be fill'd, The Saints thy Truth shall own. 6Do's any of the heav'nly Host, Like Thee, deserve Regard? Who of the Mighty Strength can boast, With thine to be compar'd? 7God sits in Heav'n of Bliss possest, And spreads an awful Fear, Thro' all th' Assemblies of the Blest, That round his Trone appear. Part II. 8Lord God of Hosts, where is the God That shews such Strength as Thine? Who e'er such faithful Steps have trod, As in thy Conduct shine? 9Thy Word the Ocean do's controul, Which Storms with Uproar fill; If rising Waves begin to roll, Thou do'st the Tumult still. 10 Egypt in pieces Thou hast broke, As a slain Man she lies; And by thy Arm's resistless Stroke The Foe before Thee flies. 11Lord of the World, the Heav'ns are Thine, The Earth and all Things there; For Heav'n and Earth, of Love divine And Might, the Creatures are. 12The Land that north and southward lies, Rose at thy pow'rful Voice; Tabor and Hermon mid'st the Skies, Shall in thy Name rejoyce. 13Thou hast a mighty Arm, thy Hand Is strong, thy Right-hand high; 14Thy Throne do's fix'd by Justice stand, And Mercy's in thine Eye. 15Blest are they, who the Trumpets know, That to thy House invite; To these Thou, Lord, well pleas'd will show Of thy bright Face the Light. 16All Day they'll triumph in thy Name, And Exaltation see; 17Thou Glory of our Strength, in Fame Our Horn shall rise by Thee. Part III. 18Thee, Jacob, God thy Shield defends, And Israel's Holy One, From his high Dignity, descends, To sit on Israel's Throne. 19A Vision to his Prophet said Sent from the Seats of Light, Help on my Chosen, I have laid, And rais'd up one of Might. 20My Servant David I have found, My Oyl upon him shed; 21And I'll uphold the King, I crown'd, And his Dominion spread. 22The Enemy shall not distress, Nor him by Arms controul; Nor shall the Sons of Wickedness Afflict his righteous Soul. 23I will subdue before his Face His proud and crafty Foes, And sorely Plague the wicked Race, That hate Him and oppose. 24But on my Truth and Mercy sworn, He firmly may rely; And in my Name his conqu'ring Horn Shall be exalted High. 25To the Sea's Bound'ries on the West His Empire I'll extend, And the great River on the East Its Frontier shall defend. 26He'll me his Father, God, the Rock Of his Salvation own; 27This First-born of my filial Stock I'll o'er the Kings enthrone. 28For ever, he shall Mercy gain, Sure is my Promise giv'n; 29Long shall his Throne and Seed remain, Ev'n as the Days of Heav'n. Part IV. 30My Judgments should his Sons despise, My Precepts disobey, 31Should they Unrighteousness devise, And from my Statutes stray. 32Then will I, tho' to punish slow, To visit them begin; My Rod shall my Displeasure show, My Stripes chastise their Sin: 33Yet never shall my Wrath prevail Quite to suppress my Love; Ne'er shall my promis'd Mercy fail, But still I'll Faithful prove. 34My Covenant I will not break, Nor, what I said, deny; 35I by my Holiness did speak, Nor will to David lie. 36His House and Throne no End shall know, But with the Sun shall vie; 37Sure as the Moon, and beauteous Bow God's Witness in the Skie. 38But notwithstanding what, O Lord, Thou hast to David sworn, Thou thy Anointed hast abhor'd, And cast him off in Scorn. 39Thou mad'st thy Servant's Compact void, Spurn'd in the Dust his Crown; 40All his strong Places hast destroy'd, And broke his Fences down. 41He's spoil'd by all, that pass him by, They mock the King, thy Choice; 42Thou hast advanc'd his Rivals high, And made his Foes rejoyce. 43Lord, Thou his Sword did'st edgeless make, Nor let him stand in Fight; 44His Glory Thou did'st from him take, And overturn his Might. Part V. 45Short Thou hast cut our Sov'raign's Reign, And spread his Youth with Shame; 46Still shall thy Face conceal'd remain? Like Fire, thy Fury flame? 47Think, Lord, to me how small a Span Of Life thou do'st ordain; Why hast Thou then on short-liv'd Man Laid so much Grief and Pain? 48What Man shall not confess at length His Life he cannot save, Nor by his Art, or mighty Strength, Escape th' expecting Grave? 49Where is thy former Kindness now, Thy Mercy, Lord, and Care, The Blessings, undeserv'd, which Thou Had'st oft to David sware? 50Remember, Lord, the scornful Words Cast on us by the Foe; How the Reproaches of great Lords broach'd Deep in my Bosom go: 51The sharp Reproaches which they broach'd To Thee, O Lord, well known, Which have th' expected Steps reproach'd Of thy anointed One. 52Tho' Heathens mock our Woes, yet we Cry, God be ever blest; We praise Him in Sincerity, As loud Amens attest. Psalm XC. 1 An Habitation Thou hast been To us, Jehovah blest, Thro' Generations past our Screen, And Shelter, when distrest. 2'Ere the high Hills rose at thy Nod, And Earth began to Be, Thou from Eternity art God, And to Eternity. 3Thou to Destruction turn'st apace The Sons of mortal Men, And then Thou say'st, ye Adam's Race, Turn now to Dust agen. 4A Circle of a thousand Years Is nothing in thy Sight, As Yesterday, it disappears, Or as a Watch by Night. 5Thou do'st, as with a Torrent, sweep And carry them away; They are as Dreams, when Mortals sleep, Which are dissolv'd by Day. 6Man, as the Offspring of the Mead, At Morn do's blooming rise; At Eve he hangs his fading Head, Or cut down, with'ring lies. 7Thy Frowns our troubled Souls affright, We by thy Anger waste; 8Our Errours Thou in open Light, And secret Sins hast plac'd. 9Cast down by wrath Divine, behold, Our Days in pain we spend, And as a Tale that soon is told, Our Transient Life will End: Part II. 10Our Days are Threescore Years and Ten, If Strength shall Fourscore give; That Strength is Toil and Grief, and then Cut down, we cease to live. 11Who of thy Anger's mighty Pow'r Can form Conceptions true? Thou, as Men fear Thee less or more, Wrath more or less dost shew. 12Teach us to count our Days, that we, To Wisdom may assent; 13To us return, Lord, speedily, Concerning us repent. 14Our Souls with Mercy satisfie, That we may still be glad, 15And let our Years of Pleasure vie With all our dark and sad. 16O let thy Servants finish'd see Thy Work so long design'd, And let their late Posterity Things yet more glorious find. 17Lord, let thy Grace on us abide, Thy Favour and Respect; Our Works and Ways confirm and guide; Yea all our Works direct. Psalm XCI. 1 Lord, he that seeks thy secret Place, Safe in thy Shade abides; 2My God, my Fort, Thee I imbrace, In whom my Soul confides. 3He'll save thee from the Fowler's Snare And from the Pestilence: 4He'll o'er thee spread his Wings with Care, His Truth is thy Defence. 5The secret Terrours of the Night Shall never thee dismay, Nor shall the Darts thy Soul affright, Which fill the Air by Day; 6Nor deadly Plague that walks in Shades And in the Dark assails, Nor Torment, that by Noon invades, And wasting-wide prevails. 7A Thousand on thy Left shall die, Ten Thousand on thy Right; For when th' Almighty's Arrows fly, They'll shun thee in their Flight. 8Thou'lt only see this with thy Eye, The proud Man's Recompence, 9Because Thou mak'st the Lord most High, My Refuge, thy Defence. 10No Mischief shall thy Self ensnare, No Plague thy House infect; 11Thee shall his Angels, Thee their Care, In all thy Ways protect. 12They as commanded, Thee will own, And in their Hands sustain, Lest Thou against an unseen Stone, Should'st dash thy Foot in Pain. 13Thou on the Lyon's Neck shalt tread, The Adder fearless meet; The Dragon's and young Lyon's Head Thou'lt crush beneath thy Feet. 14Because he lov'd me constantly, I'll rescue him from Shame, And will advance his Head on high, For he has known my Name. 15I'll hear his Pray'r, supply his Want, And succour him in Woe; To him I'll sure Deliv'rance grant, And make him Honour know. 16With Days, that late shall ended be, I will my Servant cloy, And he shall my Salvation see, And its sweet Fruits enjoy. Another Metre. As the CXLVIII. 1 Lord, they that love thy House, Safe in thy Shadow hide; 2I Thee, my Fort, espouse, And in my God confide. 3From Pestilence, That do's, like Snares, Catch unawares, He's thy Defence. 4His Wings He'll o'er thee spread, His Truth shall be thy Stay; 5By Night no Pow'r thoul't dread, Nor Dart, that flies by Day. 6Nor shall the Pest That walks in gloom Or wastes by Noon Disturb thy Rest. 7Heaps on thy Left shall die, And Thousands on thy Right; For when Death's Arrows fly, They'll shun thee in their Flight. 8Only thy Eye From Danger free, Shall look and see The wicked die. 9Because thy Choice has made The Lord thy Place of Rest, 10No Ill shall thee invade, No Plague thy House infest. 11He'll Angels send, Who thee their Care Shall ev'ry where From Snares defend. 12They thee their Charge shall own, And in their Hands sustain, Lest thou against a Stone, Should'st dash thy Foot in Pain. 13The Serpent's Head, The Lyon, Asp Thou'lt Conqu'rour grasp, And on them tread. 14Because he lov'd me, I Will rescue him from Shame, And will advance him High, For he has known my Name. 15I'll hear his Cries, And set him free From Woe, and he In Pow'r shall rise. 16With Length of Days to cloy My Servant I'll engage, And he shall Life enjoy, To hoary headed Age. And he shall know, That to him I Will graciously Salvation show. Psalm XCII. 1 Praises and Thanks to God convey, For it is good and Right, 2To shew his Kindness all the Day, His Mercy ev'ry Night. 3Upon a Ten-string'd Instrument, Joyn'd with the Psalt'ries Sound, And on the Harp, which with Consent Sweet Harmony compound. 4Triumph to me thy Works afford, The Works, thy Hand has wrought; 5How mighty are thy Deeds, O Lord, And how profound thy Thought? 6The brutish Fool can't this descry, 7That when the wicked thrives, 8And springs, like Grass, his Ruin's nigh; But God for ever lives. 9For see thy Foes, Lord, see thy Foes Are to Destruction doom'd; And Sinners, who thy Laws oppose, Dispers'd shall be consum'd. 10But Thou shalt high exalt my Horn, And make it strong for Toil, Like that, which arms the Unicorn; And me anoint with Oyl. 11My Eyes shall see, my Ears shall hear My Wishes on my Foe; 12The Just shall, as the Palm, appear, And, as the Cedar, grow. 13The Plants, that in thy House take root, Thrive in thy Courts around, 14They in old Age shall bring forth Fruit, With Strength and Beauty crown'd. 15This will thy secret Way unlock, Thy righteous Steps explain; Thou art my Shield my shelt'ring Rock, Thy Justice knows no Stain. Another Metre. As the XXV??. 1 Thanks to the Lord convey, For it is good and right; 2Shew forth his Kindness ev'ry Day, His Justice ev'ry Night. 3The Ten-string'd Instrument, The Harp and Psalt'ry sweet, Should with the Singers Voice consent, And in full Consort meet. 4Joy is to me restor'd By Works, which Thou hast wrought; 5How mighty are thy Deeds, O Lord? And how profound thy Thought? 6The Fool can't this descry, 7That when the Wicked thrives And springs like Grass, his Ruin's nigh: 8But God for ever lives. 9For see, O Lord, thy Foes Are to Destruction doom'd, And sinners, who thy Laws oppose, Dispers'd shall be consum'd. 10But Thou shalt raise my Horn, And make it strong for Toil, Like that which arms the Unicorn; And me anoint with Oyl. 11I shall behold or hear My Wishes on my Foe; 12The Just shall as the Palm appear, And as the Cedar grow. 13Plants in thy House take root, And thrive in Courts around; 14They in old Age shall bring forth Fruit, With Strength and Beauty crown'd. 15This will thy Ways unlock, Thy righteous Steps explain; Thou art my Shield, my shelt'ring Rock, Thy Justice knows no Stain. Psalm XCIII. 1 The Lord o'er Kings and Kingdoms reigns, In Majesty and Glory clad; He girt with Strength the World sustains, And makes the settled Nations glad 2Thy Throne establish'd is of old, From Everlasting is thy Age; 3Proud Floods, O Lord, Floods uncontroul'd, With all their Billows roar and rage. 4The Lord on High in Pow'r outvies The Sea, when Storms its Waters rouse; 5Thy Statutes all are sure and wise, Still Holiness becomes thy House. Psalm XCIV. 1 Lord God of Vengeance shew the Might, With which Thou art endow'd; 2Rise of the Earth thou Judge upright, And recompence the Proud. 3How long, how long shall at our Cost, The Wicked shout for Joy? 4How long shall evil Workers boast, And haughty Speech employ? 5In Ruin these thy People lay, Thy Heritage oppress; 6The Widow and the Stranger slay, And kill the Fatherless. 7And yet among themselves they cry, Grown insolent and bold, The Lord our Deeds shall not espy, Nor Jacob's God behold. 8Ye brutish Men, Instruction hear, Will Fools ne'er wiser be? 9He that contriv'd the Eye and Ear, Shall he not hear and see? 10Can't he for you Correction find, Who makes the Heathen smart? It is ev'n He, who to the Mind Its Knowledge do's impart. 11God, that our Thoughts are all unwise, And empty, can attest; 12But he whom thy kind Stripes chastise, Taught by thy Law is blest. 13For to th' Abodes of Rest he goes From black and adverse Days, While the dark Pit is dug for those Who walk in wicked Ways. Part II. 14God will not cast us off with Scorn, Nor will his Portion slight; 15But equal Judgment shall return Approv'd by Men upright. 16What Pow'r will rise, who'll for me stand, And from the Wicked save? 17Without th' Almighty's helping Hand My Lot had been the Grave. 18When I was near to Ruin brought Thou sav'd'st me by thy Might, 19And when perplex'd with anxious Thought Thy Comforts me delight: 20Shall Pow'rs and Thrones of impious Name Have Fellowship with Thee, Who by a Statute Mischief frame, And Wickedness decree? 21Against the just Man's Life they joyn, And shed his guiltless Blood; 22But God his Care will ne'er resign, My Rock against the Flood. 23He their own Sins shall on them bring, And to Destruction doom, In their own Guilt, our God and King Shall the vile Race consume. Psalm XCV. 1 O come, our Voices let us raise, And sing unto the Lord; Let us the Rock with Shouting praise Which Safety do's afford. 2Before Him let us thankful stand, And Psalms triumphant sing; 3God is a God of great Command, Above all Gods a King. 4The Earth's deep Caves are in his Hand, His is the Mountain's Height; 5The Sea is his, and his the Land, He form'd them by his Might. 6O, come in deep Submission ly, And bow before Him low; Worship and kneel to God most high, To whom we Being owe. 7For He's our God, we Him obey, The People of his Choice, The Sheep his Pastures feed, to Day If you will hear his Voice; 8Then grow not hard, as in the Time Of Strife at Meribah, 9When Israel prov'd me by their Crime, While they my Wonders saw. 10Griev'd by this People forty Years I did in Anger say, Their Heart to Error prone appears, Nor have they known my Way. 11I then detested this vile Race, And in my Wrath I sware, They should not see my resting Place, Nor promis'd Canaan Share. Psalm XCVI. 1 Sing a new Song, sing ye to God, All Earth loud Thanks convey; 2Bless Him in Hymns, and tell abroad His Mercies Day by Day. 3His glorious Works to Heathens tell, Great do's the Lord appear, 4Worthy all Praise, and do's excell All Gods the Nations fear. 5Their Gods are Idols and a Lye, Ours spread the heav'nly Space: 6With Him are Strength and Majesty, Glory's his Dwelling Grace. 7Give to Jehovah Strength and Fame, Ye Nations Praises sing; 8Give Him the Honour of his Name, And Off'rings to Him bring. 9Worship the Lord in his Abode, His beauteous, holy Place; Let all the Earth his Greatness land, And fear before his Face. 10Say, mid'st the Heathen, God do's reign, An Empire He has rais'd, Which shall unmov'd all Foes disdain, And be for Judgment prais'd. 11O let th' extended Heav'ns rejoyce, The Earth sing grateful Strains, The Sea lift up its roaring Voice, And all Things it contains. 12Now let the Field, and all Things there With Shouts of Triumph ring, Then shall the Woods their Joy declare, Before the Lord the King. 13For see, He comes, He comes to bless The Earth with just Commands; He'll judge the World in Righteousness, And with his Truth the Lands. Psalm XCVII. 1 The Lord He reigns, O Earth! let Hills And Vales rejoyce and sing, And let the Multitude of Isles With Shouts of Triumph ring. 2Darkness, and Clouds, and gloomy Night, Surround his awful Court, And Justice, Truth, and Judgment right His stable Throne support 3See, to consume his Enemies, Before Him Flames appear'd; 4His Light'nings flash'd along the Skies, The Earth beheld, and fear'd. 5Like yielding Wax before the Sun, The Hills, that Storms defy, Before the Lord did melt and run, Ev'n Nature's Lord most High. 6The spreading Heav'ns his Righteousness Declare in Consort joyn'd, And all the People see and bless His Glory unconfin'd. 7Be all confounded, who accost The Graver's Work with Fear, Who of their empty Idols boast, Ye Gods, the Lord revere. 8 Zion, O Lord, thy Deeds of Might With Pleasure heard and told, And Judah's Daughters took delight Thy Judgments to behold. 9For Thou, O Lord, art High and Great, The Earth beneath Thee lies; Above all Gods is thy blest Seat Exalted in the Skies, 10You, who th' Almighty Love and Trust, Your Hate of Evil show; He'll save their Lives, and guard the Just Against the wicked Foe. 11Light for the Just is sown and stor'd, Joy shall the Upright bless, 12Triumph ye Righteous in the Lord, And laud his Holiness. Psalm XCVIII. 1 Sing to the Lord, sing a new Song, New Wonders He has done; See, his Right-hand and Arm most strong Has glorious Conquests won. 2He his Salvation has made known His Justice brought to Light, And openly his Might has shown Before the Heathens Sight. 3To Israel's House still in his Mind His Love and Truth have been; Kindreds and Tribes of ev'ry Kind Have thy Salvation seen. 4O all ye Nations, to the Lord A joyful Triumph raise; Shouting aloud, with one accord Rejoyce, and sing his Praise. 5Joyn to the Harp the tuneful Voice, Psalms of Thanksgiving sing; 6With Trumpets and with Fifes rejoyce Before the Lord, the King. 7Let the glad Ocean's Billows roar, And all Things in its Tide; Let the whole Earth the Lord adore, And all that there abide. 8By clapping of their Hands, their Joy Let the loud Floods confess; Ye Hills combin'd all Marks employ, That great Delight express: 9Before the Lord, who with Applause Comes Justice to decree; He'll judge the World by righteous Laws, The Lands with Equity. Psalm XCIX. 1 Jehovah reigns, and He alone, Let all the People shake; Between the Cherubs is his Throne, O Earth, in Terrour quake. 2God, who in Zion has his Seat, From all do's Homage claim; 3Ye Nations praise the Lord, for Great And Holy is his Name. 4God, the King's Strength, tho' great in Might, Impartial Justice loves; In Jacob He has settled Right, And Equity approves. 5Exalt th' Almighty's Majesty, In Adoration dwell, Low at his Footstool ly, for He As Holy do's excel. 6 Moses and Aaron Priests of Fame, And Samuel God implor'd, With Zeal they call'd upon his Name, And He did Aid afford. 7From the dark Cloud He these bespoke, To them his Will explain'd, For they observ'd his Word, nor broke The Statutes He ordain'd. 8These did'st Thou hear, O Lord our God, And Israel's Sins o'erlook, Tho' Vengeance thy afflicting Rod On their Inventions took. 9Praise to the Lord our God repeat, Worship at Zion's Hill, For He the Lord our God is Great, And Holy is his Will. Psalm C. 1 In loud Applauses, all ye Lands, With Joy extol the Lord your King; 2Gladly obey his high Commands, Come, and before his Presence sing. 3Know He is God, his Work are we, And not our own, we are his Sheep, Ev'n his peculiar Flock, that He Do's in his pleasant Pastures keep. 4O enter then his Gates with Joy, Approach his Courts with cheerful Praise, Your Lips in thankful Songs employ, And his great Name adoring raise. 5For God is good, his Mercies sure Will to all Generations last, His Truth for ever will endure Unmov'd, as thro' all Ages past. Psalm CI. 1 Of Mercy, which to Thee belongs, And Judgment I will sing; I will direct my pious Songs To Thee, Eternal King. 2I'll wisely perfect Ways espouse, Keep not from me apart, And in the Conduct of my House I'll show an upright Heart. 3I'll set no Ill before my Eyes With Pleasure and Design; I those, that turn from God, despise, Nor to their Works incline. 4Men of vile Ways and impious Mind, I'll from my House expel; Nor shall the Race my Favour find, Who against Thee rebel. 5Those, who defame with secret Lies Their Neighbour, I'll disgrace; All of proud Heart and lofty Eyes, I'll banish from my Face. 6I'll search out faithful Men, and raise The Just to high Command, And he that walks in perfect Ways, Shall in my Presence stand. 7They, who by Falsehood aim to rise, With me shall never dwell; And those, that spread destructive Lies, I'll from my House expel. 8With early Care I will destroy The Wicked of the Land, To purge thy City I'll employ, Lord, my avenging Hand. Psalm CII. 1 O Lord, my Pray'r in Trouble hear, And let my Cry succeed; 2Hide not thy Face, but bow thy Ear, And answer me with speed. 3For, see, my Minutes are consum'd, And fly like Smoke away, And my dry'd Bones to Ruin doom'd Burnt, as a Hearth, decay. 4My Heart is smit, as with a Blast The Grass, my Bed I leave, 5My Bones by constant Anguish waste, And to my Skin they cleave. 6I'm like the Pelican, I own, Or Owl for Desarts fit, 7I watch, and like a Bird alone, On the House-top, I sit. 8Still do's my Foe me vilely treat, And mad against me swears: 9Ashes to me have been for Meat, I mix'd my Drink with Tears; 10Because of Wrath, express'd by Thee, And thy indignant Frown; For Thou hast lifted me on high, And Thou hast cast me down. Part II. 11My Day dos, Shadow-like, depart, My Life, like Grass, decays; 12But Thou, O Lord, for ever art, Still thy Memorial stays. 13Rise, Zion save, to do her Right Th' appointed Times appear; 14Thy Servants in her Stones delight, Her Dust is to them dear. 15Heathens shall with thy Fear be fill'd, All Kings shall Thee revere; 16When Zion's State he shall rebuild, In Glory He'll appear. 17He'll not the Poor's Petition scorn, But yield to his Address; 18This shall be writ for Men unborn, Who shall Jehovah bless. 19God look'd from Heav'n the Lands to see, From Heav'n his Throne on high, 20To hear the Pris'ners Groans, and free The Poor condemn'd to die. 21His Name in Zion to declare, In Salem his Renown, 22When Kings and People gather'd are To bow before Him down. Part III. 23God much has weaken'd Israel's Strength, Has stop'd our prosp'rous Ways, And much restrain'd th' expected Length Of our successful Days. 24Cut not our growing Nation short, I said, 'ere 'tis mature; But tho' we perish, our Support, God ever will endure. 25The Earth's Foundations Thou hast laid, 'Ere Time began its Course; And thy Right-hand the Heav'ns display'd With strong creative Force. 26Thou shalt endure, but they shall fade, Old, like a Garment, grow; Thou'lt change them as a Vest decay'd, And they a Change shall know. 27But Time in Thee no Change can breed, No Bounds thy Years restrain; 28Therefore thy Servants, and their Seed Before Thee shall remain. Psalm CIII. 1 O bless the Lord, to bless his Name Still let my Heart be wholly set; 2Bless Him, my Soul, his Praise proclaim, Nor all his Benefits forget. 3Who all thy Errors do's forgive, Thy Sickness and thy Pains remove; 4Bids thee, when near Destruction, live, And crowns thee with his kindest Love. 5He fills thy Soul with Good, thy Youth, Like that of Eagle's, He renews; 6Judgment the Lord in Right and Truth To all oppress'd and helpless shews. 7He made his Ways to Moses known, His mighty Acts to Israel's Seed; 8He's slow to Wrath, to Mercy prone, And ev'ry kind and gracious Deed. 9He will not still in Wrath contend, Nor chide, tho' Men from Justice swerve; 10He oft forbears, when we offend, And ne'er afflicts, as we deserve. 11As high as Heav'n, th' Almighty's Seat, Is rais'd above this Earthly Frame, So is his loving Kindness great, To all, who love and fear his Name. As far, as from the utmost West, The Eastern Land at distance lies, So far the Pity in his Breast Removes our past Iniquities. Part II. 13To Sons the Father Pity shows, So God in Pity spares the Just; 14For He, who our frail Nature knows, Kindly remembers we are Dust. 15Man's Days resemble Grass, he blooms, As in the Fields the short-liv'd Flow'r, 16Which blasted by the Wind consumes, Nor shall its Place e'er know it more. 17But Mercy shall to them, that fear Th' Almighty's Name, for ever last; To Him their Children's Children dear Fruits of his Faithfulness shall taste. 18Who ne'er his Covenant disown, But always his Commands obey; 19The Lord in Heav'n prepar'd his Throne, And over all extends his Sway. 20Ye Angels, who in Strength excell, Extol your high eternal God, Who in his Court Celestial dwell, Still watchful to observe his Nod. 21Ye Ministers of God most High, Ye happy Hosts, ye Sons of Light, Who to obey Him ready fly, With Zeal th' Almighty's Praise recite. 22O let the Lord by all be prais'd, By all his num'rous Works ador'd, Within his wide Dominions rais'd: My grateful Soul bless thou the Lord. Another Metre. 1 O bless the Lord, to bless his Name Let my whole Heart be set: 2Bless God, my Soul, his Praise proclaim, Nor Mercies past forget. 3Who kindly do's thy Sins forgive, Thy Maladies remove; 4Bids thee, when nigh Destruction, live, And crowns thee with his Love. 5Who fills thy Soul with Good, thy Youth Thus Eagle-like renews; 6Judgment the Lord, in Right and Truth, To all the injur'd shews. 7He made his Ways to Moses known, His Acts to Israel's Seed; 8He's slow to Wrath, to Mercy prone, And ev'ry gracious Deed. 9He will not chide and still contend, His Anger He'll avert: 10He oft forbears when we offend, Nor pays Sin's full Desert. 11As high as Heav'n the Almighty's Seat Is o'er this earthly Frame, So is his loving Kindness great To those, who fear his Name. 12As the remotest parts of East And West asunder are, From us the Pity in his Breast Removes our Sins as far. Part II. 13To Sons the Father Pity shows, So God forbears the Just; 14For He, who our frail Nature knows, Remembers we are Dust. 15Man's Days resemble Grass, he blooms, As in the Field the Flow'r, 16Which blasted by the Wind consumes, And knows its Place no more. 17But Mercy shall to them, that fear His Name, for ever last, To God their Children's Children dear His Faithfulness shall taste: 18Who to his sacred Covenant Still due Submission pay, Who ne'er a Will effectual want His Precepts to obey. 19Above the Heav'ns by boundless Might The Lord prepar'd his Throne, O'er all with undisputed Right He Sov'raign rules alone. 20Ye Angels, who are excellent In Strength, extol the Lord; Who still to serve him are intent, And hearken to his Word. 21Ye Hosts of Heav'n, who to fullfil His Pleasure take Delight; Ye Ministers, who do his Will, Jehovah's Praise recite. 22By all Things thro' the Realms dispers'd, Which his Commands controul, O let his Praises be rehears'd: Bless thou the Lord, my Soul. Psalm CIV. As the L??. 1 My Soul repeat Praise to the Lord, for He Is very Great, And cloath'd with Majesty. 2He's rob'd in Light That all Access denies; He spreads, to Sight Pavillion-like, the Skies. 3He has the Floors Of his high Chambers laid On watry Stores, Amid'st the Skies convey'd. His Chariots are Black Clouds, that roll on high, While He in Air Do's on wing'd Tempests fly. 4His Angels He Do's with swift Force inspire, His Ministry He makes a flaming Fire. 5Who has so fast The Earth's Foundations laid, It still shall last, Of no fierce Storm afraid. 6The Flood o'erspreads Like a wide Vest the Land, O'er Mountains Heads Th' uplifted Waters stand. 7They with great Noise At thy Rebuke withdrew; Thy Thunder's Voice They heard, and frighted flew. 8Up by the Hill And down the Vale they creep, And haste to fill For them th' appointed Deep. 9Thou Bounds hast set Their Fury to restrain, Lest Pow'r they get To drown the Earth again: Part II. 10Thro' Vales below He sends fresh Springs and Rills, Whence Rivers grow, That run between the Hills. 11Beasts of the Field To drink do hither pass, Sweet Draughts they yield To the wild stupid Ass. 12The Birds of Wing Do hither take their Flight, And here to sing Mid'st branching Trees delight. 13On the high Plain Dews from his Rooms He pours; The Earth rich Grain Brings forth, refresh'd with Show'rs. 14By his Command, Fields Grass for Beasts produce, And Herbs the Land Brings forth for human Use. 15And cheering Wine, And Oyl, by which when fed, Our Faces shine, And Heart-reviving Bread. 16Trees of vast Size, Which his rich Juices fill, As Cedars rise On Lebanon's fair Hill. 17Where wond'rous Work, Their Nests, the Birds design; As for the Stork, Her Dwelling is the Pine. 18In Mountains high Wild Goats a Refuge find, And shelter'd lie In Rocks, the feeble Kind. Part III. 19He bids the Moon A changing Figure show, And makes the Sun His time of Setting know. 20Thou mak'st the Night, When Beasts, that haunt the Wood, Till dawning Light Roam thro' the Hills for Food. 21In quest of Prey Young rav'ning Lyons roar, And loud till Day For Meat they God implore. 22At tising Morn, Which rouses us from Sleep, They all return, And to their Coverts creep. 23Man with Repose Grown active, early wakes, To Labour goes, And Pains till Ev'ning takes. 24Thy Works, O Lord, Are many, great, and wise; The Earth well stor'd With various Wonders lies. 25So this wide Deep Is a replenish'd Seat Of Things that creep, Of Fish both small and great. 26There Ships advance, There has the Whale his Court, That's made to dance, And in the Billows sport. 27Thy Family To Thee their Master sue, And beg from Thee Their Meat in Season due. 28They from the Land Take what Thou giv'st for Food, Thy open Hand Fills all their Souls with Good. Part IV. 29Thou frown'st, they mourn, Thou tak'st away their Breath; They die, and turn Again to Dust in Death. 30To give new Birth Thou Vertue do'st diffuse, And of the Earth The Face thy Pow'r renews. 31God's Glory bright For ever shall endure, To him Delight His Works review'd procure. 32At his stern Look Earth trembles; by his Stroke The Mountains shook, And threw up Clouds of Smoke. 33See, while I live, I to the Lord will sing, While Breath He'll give, I'll praise my God and King. 34I with Delight Will Thoughts on Him employ, All Day and Night He is my sweetest Joy. 35Perish th' Unjust, Let Sinners be no more; The Lord, thy Trust, O Thou my Soul, adore. Another Metre 1 Bless thou, the Lord, my Soul, repeat His Praise, O Lord my God most High; Thou art above Conception Great, With Honour cloath'd and Majesty. 2Cover'd with pure immortal Light, As with a Robe magnificent, Who, as a Curtain wide and bright, Spreads forth the Heav'ns of vast Extent. 3Who builds on Waters of the Skies His Chambers, where his Pow'r resides; On rolling Clouds, his Chariot flies, And on the swift wing'd Tempest rides. 4Who all his Angels Spirits made, His Ministers a fiery Flame, 5And who the strong Foundations laid Of the wide Earth's unshaken Frame. 6Thou did'st the flowing Waters spread, Which as a Vest, the Land enclose; Above the Mountains lofty Head The swelling Inundation rose. 7At thy Rebuke those Waters flew, They heard thy Thunder's awful Voice, And from the tow'ring Hills withdrew, And made the humble Ground their Choice. 8They climb the Mountain's steepy Brow, Thence rushing down the Valley gain, And to the vast Receiver flow Founded their Treasures to contain. 9Thou, to restrain the raging Deep, Hast set a Bound of spreading Sand, That here the Waves their Seat might keep. Nor turn again to drown the Land. Part II. 10He bade the Springs and streaming Rills Along the Valley's Bosom glide, Wand'ring among th' aspiring Hills They draw along their winding Tide. 11They ev'ry Beast supply with Drink; See, here their Thirst wild Asses slake; 12Birds, which inhabit on their Brink, Among the Trees sweet Musick make. 13He waters, from his Chambers high; The cleaving Hills and russet Plains; His Works the Land thus satisfy, With cheering Dews and fruitful Rains. 14For Beasts He gives to Grass its Birth, Brings forth the Herb for human Use, And bids the fertile labour'd Earth Sufficient Food for all produce. 15His Bounty gives delicious Wine, Which to the Soul do's Joy impart, And Oyl, that makes our Faces shine, And Bread-Corn, that supports the Heart. 16God's planted Trees with Sap are fill'd, Chiefly thy Cedars, Lebanon, 17Where various Birds their Houses build, While Firs the Stork their Tenant own. 18The Forrest-Goats a Refuge find On Hills, that rise aloft in Air, Conies, and Beasts of savage Kind, For Shelter to the Rocks repair. Part III. 19He bids the Moon for Seasons run The Stages of her heav'nly Way, And dictates to th' obedient Sun His time to set, and call in Day. 20Thou do'st the Skies with Darkness spread, Then Night, the Sun departed, reigns; Now Forest-Beasts by Hunger led Forsake their Haunts and range the Plains. 21Young Lyons roar, in quest of Prey, They seek from God, their nightly Meat; 22And at the early Dawn of Day, To their known Dens for Rest retreat. 23Now Swains to usual Labour rise, Go forth, and till the Ev'ning toil: 24How various are thy Works? how Wise? Thy Riches, Lord, fill ev'ry Soil. 25By Thee the Ocean's Wealth began, Where small and great mute Nations sport; 26There flies the Ship, Leviathan There triumphs in his watry Court. 27All these on Thee, obedient wait, And on thy gracious Care depend, That Thou, new Vigour to create, May'st needful Food in Season send. 28Whate'er they gather from the Land, They to thy endless Bounty owe: Thou open'st wide thy lib'ral Hand, And they in plenteous Goodness flow. Part IV. 29If Thou thy Face should'st turn away, They would in Depths of Trouble mourn; When Thou their Breath demandest, they To Dust, from whence they came, return 30Thro' all the Earth, and Sea, and Air, Thou do'st thy quick'ning Spirit send, Which Natures Losses to repair, Do's thro' the World new Life extend. 31Thro' all Duration, that ensues, Th' Almighty's Glory shall endure: When his great Works his Eye reviews, Joy to their Author they procure. 32If He from Heav'n looks Angry down, The troubled Earth's Foundations quake; Should He on lofty Mountains frown, Their Heads would smoke, their Pillars shake. 33But, as for me, to this Great King My Voice in sacred Songs I'll raise; While living to my God I'll sing, And spend my Being in his Praise. 34When I shall think of God most kind, My Meditation will be sweet; When I his Mercy call to mind, My Soul will Joy triumphant meet. 35From Earth let Sinners be destroy'd, And let the Wicked be no more: Be thou my Soul in Praise employ'd, Let all the Earth the Lord adore. Psalm CV. 1 O bless the Lord, call on his Name, His Deeds in Publick crown; 2In Songs of Praise his Works proclaim, And speak of his Renown. 3O Glory in his boundless Might, Be his great Name ador'd; And let your Heart feel great Delight, All ye that seek the Lord. 4Seek in his holy Place the Lord, Still be his Presence sought; 5The Judgments of his Mouth record, And Wonders by Him wrought. 6O, ye his Servants, Abram's Line, Ye Chosen Jacob's Race, 7He is our God, his Judgments shine Thro' all the Earth's wide Face. 8His Covenant remember'd stands In Truth for ever fast; The Promise fix'd by his Commands From Age to Age shall last. 9His Oath renew'd did Abram's Grant To Isaac's House secure; 10And was a Law and Covenant To Israel ever sure. 11 Canaan, said He, they shall subdue, This Lot they shall command, 12When they in Number were but few, And Strangers in the Land. 13When they thro' various Nations strong From Land to Land remov'd, 14He suffer'd none to do them wrong, But for them Kings reprov'd. 15Touch not said He, with a proud Arm, But my Anointed spare, And, not to do my Prophets harm, Be it your constant Care. Part II. 16Besides, a Famine at his Call, Was o'er the Kingdom spread: His Curse did on their Harvests fall, And broke their Staff of Bread. 17See, He before them Joseph sent, A Slave thro' Envy made; 18Whose Feet with Fetters they torment, He was in Irons laid. 19Till in due Time the sacred Word Of blest Jehovah came, The Revelation of the Lord, That try'd and clear'd his Fame. 20The King, who did o'er Egypt reign, His royal Order gave, They loos'd th' imprison'd Hebrew's Chain, And freed the guiltless Slave. 21His House He made him to inspect, And o'er his Realm preside, 22Princes at Pleasure to correct, And Senators to guide. 23Then Jacob left his native Soil, And down to Egypt came, And Israel to relieve his Toil, Dwelt in the Land of Ham. 24He made his People fruitful grow, Their Numbers greatly swell'd; And thus encreas'd the envious Foe, In Strength they much excell'd. 25To hate his People He their Hearts, Once friendly, did prepare, And now with treach'rous subtile Arts, His Servants they ensnare. Part III. 26He his just Servant Moses sent, And Aaron, whom He chose; 27And Pow'r to work great Wonders lent, In Egypt mid'st their Foes. 28He bade his Ministers, the Skies With thickest Darkness spread, That Night might Egypt's Land surprize, And they his Word obey'd. 29He turn'd their Waters into Blood, Which gasping Fishes kill'd: 30Of croaking Frogs a plenteous Brood Their Kings high Chambers fill'd. 31He spoke, behold, of various Flies Up sprung devou'ring Hosts; And Lice, that thick as Dust did rise, Afflicted all their Coasts. 32For Rain He gave them Storms of Hail, Fire on their Soil He brought; 33Their Vines and Fig-trees He assail'd, Their Groves and Gardens smote. 34He spoke, and at his high Command, The Locusts did appear; And Caterpillars o'er the Land March'd with an endless Reer. 35These did the verdant Herbs consume, That cloath'd the Hill and Plain, Devour'd the fruitful Garden's Bloom, And of the Hills the Grain. 36By unexampled Wrath at length All Egypt's First-born fell; He smote the Offspring of their Strength That did in Birth excell. Part IV. 37He brought them from the cruel Coast, With Gold and Silver crown'd, Nor was in all their num'rous Host, One Feeble Person found. 38When they departed from the Place, It did all Egypt please; For a great Dread of Jacob's Race, Did Pharoah's Kingdom seize. 39He spread his Cloud, a shelt'ring Skreen; Against excessive Day; And that their Passage might be seen, Did Fire by Night display. 40The People ask'd, and down He show'r'd Sweet Quails, on which they fed; And from his airy Store-house pour'd, To feast them, heav'nly Bread. 41From the cleft Rock, at his Command, Abundant Waters gush'd, That wash'd dry Plains, and o'er the Land, Like swelling Rivers rush'd. 42He on his holy Promise thought To Abram and his Seed, 43And forth with Joy his chosen brought, And his glad People freed. 44He gave them Canaans Land, and they The Heathens labour hoar'd, 45That they his Statutes might obey; O magnify the Lord. Psalm CVI. 1 Give Thanks, and praise the Lord, for He Is Good, his Mercy ne'er decays: 2Can his Great Actions utter'd be? Can any shew forth all his Praise? 3They, who are always just, are bless'd: 4Lord, with that Love remember me, Which to thy People is express'd, O let me thy Salvation see; 5That I their Benefits may share, Who are distinguish'd by thy Choice, May glory with the Tribes, thy Care, And with thy Heritage rejoyce. 6We, like our Ancestors, have err'd, Nor by Examples wiser grew, But to Iniquity adher'd, And did unrighteous Ways pursue. 7Our stubborn Fathers valu'd not Thy Pow'r, which Egypt did controul, And, while thy Mercies they forgot, At the Red-Sea they griev'd thy Soul. 8Yet did the Lord his Strength exert, And Jacob safe to Canaan led, That He his Glory might assert, And thro' the Nations Terrour spread. 9See, the Red-Sea's divided Waves An Opening made at his Command, So He thro' Depths and hollow Caves His People brought, as o'er dry Land. 10He sav'd them from the threat'ning Sword, And fierce pursuing Enemies; He rescu'd them from Egypt's Lord, And did the Tyrant's Pride chastise. 11Th' uniting Waters roll'd their Flood, And cover'd all his mighty Host; 12Then Jacob own'd the Lord was good, Prais'd Him, and made his Pow'r their Boast. Part II. 13Soon they forgat his Works of Might, Nor to his Counsels would attend: 14But by their Lust ev'n in their Flight, Did mid'st the Desart God offend. 15He gave the Murm'rers their Request, And did their Want of Meat supply, Which He to nourish had not bless'd, Their Limbs, tho' fed, were lean and dry. 16They against Moses envious grew, And Aaron, whom th' Almighty chose; 17On Dathan and Abiram's Crew The opening Earth her Mouth did close. 18A Fire was kindled, and the Flame, Burnt up the vile rebellious Crowd; 19They did a Calf in Horeb frame, And to the molten Image bow'd. 20They great Ingratitude exprest, And did their God their Glory change, And made Him like the Ox, a Beast, That do's for Food the Pastures range. 21His wond'rous Deeds in Egypt done, The Land of Ham, they soon forgot, 22And From their Minds, the Glory won By the Red-Sea, did thankless blot. 23Therefore He said, He would consume Their Race, to make his Threat'nings good, If in the Breach to stop the Doom, Moses his Chosen had not stood. Part III. 24Yea they the pleasant Land despis'd, Nor would believe his faithful Word; 25But Mischief in their Tents devis'd, Murmur'd, and would not hear the Lord. 26Therefore his Hand He rais'd to slay The Rebels in the desart Sands; 27He made their Children fall a Prey, And scatter'd them thro' Heathen Lands: 28Joyn'd to Baal-Peor they did eat Of impious Off'rings to the Dead; 29God's Wrath against their Ways was great, Whence thro' the Tribes the Plague was spread. 30Then Phineas rose and Judgment wrought, And did the spreading Plague asswage; 31This Deed of Zeal was righteous thought, And still approv'd from Age to Age. 32The Lord at Meribah they vext, And Moses suffer'd for their Sake; 33For they his Soul so much perplext, That with his Lips he rashly spake. 34To slay the People, God had doom'd To utter Ruin, they refus'd; 35To mix with Heathens they presum'd, And learn'd their Ways, their Customs us'd. Part IV. 36They did their Idols serve and fear, Which the backsliding Tribes insnar'd; 37For Demons they their Children dear An impious Sacrifice prepar'd: 38While their own Offspring free from Guilt Was at their cruel Altars slain, Whose Blood to Canaan's Gods was spilt, They did the Land with Murder stain. 39Thus did their Works their Souls pollute, Their own Inventions they ador'd; 40God's Wrath took hence so deep a Root, That He his Heritage abhor'd. 41He gave them to the Heathens Yoke, Made them obey their Foes Command; 42Fierce Enemies their Nation broke, And made them subject to their Hand. 43Tho' God had oft to them dispens'd His Mercies, still they did rebell, And with their Counsel Him incens'd, Till by their Crimes brought down, they fell. 44Yet did He cast a gracious Eye Upon them, when in great Distress, And when they did for Mercy cry, He heard, and did his Wrath suppress. 45His Covenant He call'd to Mind, And out of Mercy did repent; 46He made them their Compassion's find, Whither as Captives they were sent. 47Save us, our God, from these sad Days, Let us from heathen Lands be brought, That we thy Pow'r and Love may praise, And triumph in thy Wonders wrought. 48Be blest of Israel's God the Name, Extol Him ev'ry coming Age; Amen, let all the Tribes exclaim, In Songs of Praise, let all engage. Psalm CVII. 1 The Lord is Good, his Praise proclaim, His Mercy ever flows; 2Say, ye the Lord's Redeem'd, the same, He sav'd you from your Foes. 3From ev'ry Soil He brought them forth, That Eastern Lords command; And from the West, and from the North, And ev'ry Southern Land. 4They rang'd the Wilderness around, Thro' solitary Plains, But not a Seat the Wand'rers found To end their Search and Pains 5Their Souls with Labour were oppress'd, With Thirst and Hunger faint; 6They cry'd to God, while thus distress'd, Who freed them from Complaint. 7Forth from the howling Desart, where They did affrighted roam, By the right Way the Lord with Care To Canaan led them home. 8Let all in praising God combine, Oh make his Goodness known; And to declare his Wonders joyn, To all the Nations shown. Part II. 9See, for the Hungry He do's Bread, Drink for the Thirsty find, 10Such as with Shades of Death are spread Whom hurtful Irons bind. 11Because the Counsel they despis'd, And Laws of God most High, 12Therefore his Wrath their Pride chastis'd, And none to help was nigh. 13Then in their Streights to God they pray'd, Who made their Trouble cease; 14Brought them from Death's oppressive Shade, And did their Bands release. 15Let all in praising God combine, Oh make his Goodness known, And to declare his Wonders joyn; To all the Nations shown. 16For Doors of Brass erected high He in Compassion broke, Bade Iron Bars asunder fly, And loos'd the servile Yoke. 17Fools are aflicted for the Sins, Which harden'd they commit; 18Their Soul abhoring Food, begins To reach the fatal Pit. 19For them, when griev'd they sought the Lord, Deliv'rance He decreed; 20To heal them He sent forth his Word, And from Destruction freed. 21Let them extol God's gracious Ways, And make his Wonders known; 22Offer the Sacrifice of Praise, His Works with shouting own. Part III. 23They, that go down amid'st the Main, In Ships to pass the Tide, And busy to augment their Gain, On the wide Ocean ride; 24They on his Works astonish'd gaze, His Wonders in the Deep, 25Who bids the Storm the Waters raise, And rouse the Waves from Sleep. 26Now mounting mid'st the Skies they steer, Now fall to Gulphs below; Mean time their troubled Hearts with Fear And Terrour melting flow. 27By Working's of the Ship compell'd They this and that Way reel, And, like the Drunkard scarce upheld, They great Distraction feel. 28Then in their Streights to God they pray, Toss'd on the swelling Waves, He guides them in their dang'rous Way, And from Distresses saves. 29He do's the Deep Obedience teach, Bids Storms their Fury cease; 30The Sea grown still, the Sailors reach Their wish'd for Port in Peace. 31Let them extol God's gracious Ways, His wond'rous Works proclaim; 32Him let the Tribes assembled praise, The Elders bless his Name. Part IV. 33When He a vile, ungodly Land Determines to chastise, 34He turns rich Soil to barren Sand, Each Brook and River dries. 35Then He th' unfruitful Wilderness With Lakes refreshing fills, And do's the thirsty Region bless With Springs and flowing Rills. 36And there He makes the Poor remain, Who Cities firmly build, 37And plant the Vine, and sow the Grain That Fruits abundant yield. 38He crowns them too with Health and Peace, And multiplies their Race, Nor do their woolly Flocks decrease, Nor Herds less fill the Place. 39Then proud and lofty by Success They are again brought low, Sunk by Oppression in Distress, And overwhelm'd with Woe. 40He pours Contempt on Kings, and drives Great Princes from their Home, And makes th' abandon'd Fugitives Thro' pathless Desarts roam. 41Mean time He sets the Poor on high From hard Afflictions freed, Who by his Blessing multiply, Like fruitful Flocks, their Seed. 42The Righteous shall in Triumph see The Works of his Right-hand; And insolent Iniquity Asham'd will silent stand. 43The Man that is compos'd and wise Will these great Things discern; He'll God's unbounded Kindness prize, His gracious Conduct learn. Psalm CVIII. 1 My Heart is fix'd, I'll raise my Voice, And sing a thankful Song, O God most High, I will rejoyce To praise Thee with my Tongue. 2Awake ye sleeping Strings, awake My Psalt'ry, wake my Lyre, Early my self will Rest forsake, And sing amid'st the Quire: 3I to the Tribes, who Thee adore, Thy Praises will proclaim; Thro' Realms, who Idol Gods implore, I'll sing thy glorious Name. 4Thy Truth and Mercy reach the Skies, And o'er the Clouds ascend; 5Let high as Heav'n thy Glories rise, And o'er the Earth extend. 6That Israel may Deliv'rance find, Lord, stretch forth thy Right-hand, Save them, and by my Pray'r inclin'd Their threatning Foes withstand. 7God by his Purpose will abide, His holy Oath maintain, Sichem with Joy I will divide, And mete out Succoth's Plain. 8 Gilead is mine, Manasseh mine, Ephraim my Head sustains, And favour'd Judah's Royal Line To Israel Laws ordains. 9To wash my Feet, see, Moab yields, O'er Edom flies my Shoe, To these, Philistia, know thy Fields Shall add yet Triumphs new. 10To Edom, who my Guide will be? Will not the Lord our Shield? 11Tho' once he left us, will not he Now lead us to the Field? 12Help and deliver us from Woe, The Help of Man is vain; 13Thro' God alone we valiant grow, He shall our Foes restrain. Psalm CIX. 1 To hold thy Peace, Lord, do not chuse, Blest Object of my Praise; 2For me the Vile and False abuse, And Lyes to blast me raise. 3With Words they compass'd me around, Which shew'd deep Hate and Spite, And where no Cause of Strife was found, They did against me fight. 4My Kindness made them Foes, but still To Pray'r I had regard; 5And they perversely Good with Ill And Love with Hate reward. 6Justly my Foe, Lord, to requite, I'll Judges o'er him set, Let Satan standing on the Right Th' Accuser's Charge abet. 7When at thy Judgment Seat his Cause Shall open Trial claim, He'll be condem'd by thy just Laws, And be his Pray'r his Shame. 8Be few his Days, let, when they cease, His Charge another take; 9Let Death his Children Fatherless, His Wife a Widow make. 10His Offspring naked and unfed, Without a Friend or Home, Shall while they beg, and seek their Bread, Thro' loanly Places roam. Part II. 11The Us'rer, shall his Lands ensnare, His House of Goods despoil; Strangers far off his Crop shall bear, And there enjoy his Toil. 12None Mercy, which in vain he claims, To him or his shall show; 13His Race shall fail, nor shall their Names The Age next coming know. 14His Father's great Iniquity, His Mother's Sin and Shame, 15Before the Lord shall always be, Till he blots out their Name. 16Because he did not Mercy show, But did the Poor pursue, Opprest the Needy and the Low, And broken Spirits slew. 17The Plagues, which on his Neighbour's Head He wish'd, shall reach his own; As Blessings ne'er his Pleasure bred, Be it to him unknown. 18Since cursing cloath'd him, as a Vest, Like Water it shall flow Within Him, and as Oyl new prest, Into his Bones shall go. 19As his own Garment, let it fast And constant to him cleave, And like the Girdle round his Waste, To gird Him never leave. Part III. 20O let the righteous God controul, And thus my Foes reward, Who evil speak against my Soul, Nor shew to Truth Regard. 21But, for the sake of thy great Name, Lord God, do well for me; Since Mercy is thy constant Aim, Let me Deliv'rance see. 22For poor and destitute I groan, Grief has my Heart engrost; 23I'm like a Shadow almost gone, And like a Locust tost. 24No Strength my Knees thro' fasting know, Leanness my Limbs o'erspreads; 25I of Reproach the Subject grow, They saw and shook their Heads. 26Help me, O Lord my God, and me, As Thou art gracious, save, 27That they may own thy Deed, and see Thy Hand Salvation gave. 28Still let them Curse, whilst Thou dost bless, When they would me destroy; Let Shame and Grief their Souls oppress, But fill my Heart with Joy. 29My Enemies shall Trouble see, In Shame hang down the Head, And with their own Confusion be, As with a Mantle, spread. 30I still with fervent Zeal will praise, Jehovah with my Tongue, Amid'st the Multitude I'll raise, His Glory with my Song. 31For He, to vindicate the Poor Shall stay at his Right-hand, From wicked Judges to secure His Soul, He'll for him stand. Psalm CX. 1 Behold the Lord, thus to my Lord Sit Thou at my Right-hand, has said, Till Thou thro' all the Earth ador'd Shalt on thy Foes, thy Footstool, tread. 2God shall thy potent Scepter send, From Zion, and thy Right maintain, Thy Empire far and wide extend, And make Thee o'er the Nations reign. 3Thy Sons in holy Beauty's bloom Shall, when thy Day its Pow'r shall shew, Come willing from that Morning's Womb, Sons of thy Youth, the Heav'n born Dew. 4The Lord, th' Almighty Sov'rain, swore, And in his Oath will still persist, Behold, Thou art for evermore Such as Melchisedeck, a Priest. 5O Lord, the Lord at thy Right-hand In his destructive wrathful Day. Shall strike thro' Kings of wide Command, And disobedient Princes slay. 6He'll judge among the Heathen, spread The conquer'd Places with the Slain, And deeply wound each potent Head, That do's o'er num'rous Countries reign. 7He of the Flood of Wrath divine Shall drink, while He pursues his Way, Thenceforth He'll lift his Head, and shine, The Clouds dispell'd, in stronger Day. Psalm CXI. 1 With my whole Heart I'll praise the Lord, With Saints assembled joyn'd; 2His Deeds are Great, by all explor'd, That Pleasure in them find. 3His Actions are with Glory crown'd, And boundless Praise procure; His Righteousness was still renown'd. And ever shall endure, 4So wond'rous are his mighty Deeds, Time cannot sink their Fame; He's gracious and his Bosom feeds Compassion's tender Flame. 5From Him his People Plenty find, Who fear Him and adore, The Covenant He'll keep in Mind, As solemnly He swore. 6He to his People has exprest The Pow'r of his Right-hand, When for their Sakes He dispossest The Lords of Canaan's Land. 7His Works, which merit great Applause, Are equal, right and pure; Just and impartial are his Laws, And all his Judgments sure. 8No Pow'r can his Decrees suppress, Which stand for ever fast, For fix'd on Truth and Uprightness They will unshaken last. 9Kind to his People he became, And his Redemption sent, His Covenant is firm, his Name Rever'd and excellent. 10From Fear divine true Wisdom flows, And he who God obeys, A Judgment well directed shows; All Times the Lord shall praise. Psalm CXII. 1 He's happy, who the Lord dos fear, And in his Laws delight; 2His Seed shall great on Earth appear, And blest shall be th' Upright. 3Wealth in his House abundant lies, His Justice still is sure; 4In Darkness, Light to him shall rise, He's Gracious, Good and Pure. 5The Righteous freely gives and lends, Affairs discreetely guides, 6His Suff'rings ne'er in Ruin ends, And still his Name abides. 7He'll undismay'd bad Tydings hear, In God he finds repose; 8His Heart is fix'd, nor will he fear, Till He subdues his Foes. 9He to the Poor Good-will has born, And did their Wants supply; Fix'd is his Justice, and his Horn Shall be exalted high. 10This shall the Wicked see in Pain, Shall gnash his Teeth and pine; Nor shall th' Unjust his Wishes gain, Or compass his Design. Psalm CXIII. 1 Praise to the Lord, due Praises send, You, who his sacred Rites attend, And always his Commands obey; 2O bless th' Almighty's glorious Name, And with becoming Zeal his Fame Now and for evermore display. 3Ye Potentates and People all, From the Sun's Rising to his Fall, By you his Name is to be prais'd; 4The Lord on high exalts his Head, And do's on Kings and Nations tread, Above the Heav'ns his Throne is rais'd. 5Who with our God, that dwells on high, In Glory excellent can vie, 6Who do's great Condescention show, To look on Heav'n and Earth around? 7He Lifts the Poor up from the Ground, And from the Dunghill Sons of Woe: 8That He may give them Dignity, Whence they to Kings may equal be, Ev'n Kings, that o'er his People reign; 9He makes the Barren Children bear, Who pleasur'd with a Mother's Care Rejoyce, forgetting all their Pain. Psalm CXIV. 1 God, when from Egypt Jacob came, From Men of Speech unknown, 2On Judah set his holy Name, And made their State his own. 3The Sea was scar'd, back Jordan flew, The Mountains leap'd, like Rams; 4The little Hills did Terrour shew, And skip about like Lambs. 5What ail'd thee, O thou Sea, that thou Fled'st from thy sandy Seat? And, Jordan, why did'st thou allow Thy Current to retreat? 6Ye Mountains, tell what caus'd your Flight, Why did you leap like Rams? Ye little Hills, say, what Affright Did make you skip like Lambs. 7Tremble thou Earth before the Lord, At God's dread Presence shake; The God by Jacob's Sons ador'd, Ev'n at his Presence quake 8He made the Rock a Torrent spout, And spread wide Lakes below; From the hard Flint struck Water out, And bade the Marble flow. Psalm CXV. 1 Lord, not to us, not, Lord, to us; Do Honour to thy Name, That All thy Truth establish'd thus, And Mercy may proclaim. 2Why should the taunting Heathen cry, Where is the God they own? 3Our God's in Heav'n enthron'd on high, And what He pleas'd has done. 4The Gods ador'd by heathen Lands Are Gold and Silver wrought; The Labour of the Artist's Hands, And Creatures of his Thought. 5They've Mouths, but not to speak employ'd, Eyes, that in Darkness dwell, 6And Ears, that never Sounds enjoy'd, And Noses without Smell. 7Hands too they have, but handle not; And Feet, but never move; Nor ever, thro' their silent Throat, One Note or Accent strove. 8The Men, who did these Idols frame, And at their Altars pray, And sure Protection from them claim, As stupid are, as they. Part II. 9Thou, in the Lord, O Israel, Trust, Your Strength, your Buckler try'd; 10O House of Aaron, as tis just, In Him, your Help, confide. 11All ye that fear the Lord most high, For Aid on Him depend; He with new Strength will you supply, And as a Shield defend. 12God did regard us in Distress, And hence strong Hopes arise, That He will Israel's Nations bless, Nor Aaron's House despise. 13All those that fear Him, Rich and Poor, He'll bless, and shew them Grace; 14He will advance you more and more, And multiply your Race. 15You, who th' Almighty's Name revere, Shall with his Gifts be crown'd, Who did the Earth's wide Fabrick rear, And spread the Heav'ns around. 16The Lord in his own Work, the Heav'n Of Heav'ns, enthron'd presides; But He to Man the Earth has giv'n, Where he, as Lord, abides. 17The Dead praise not the Lord, nor they, That down to Silence go; 18But we his Glory will display, Till Time shall cease to flow. Psalm. CXVI. 1 I love the Lord, who answers kind Still to my Pray'r did give; 2Since he his Ear to me inclin'd, I'll serve him while I live. 3Sorrows and Pains, like those of Death, Encompass'd me around, Almost I gasp'd away my Breath; I Grief and Trouble found. 4Then pray'd I, chasten'd by thy Rod, Lord, me from Danger pull; 5The Lord is righteous, yea our God Is good and merciful. 6He saves the humble Man distrest; When low he succour'd me; 7Return my Soul to Peace and Rest, He bounteous was to thee. 8Thou sav'dst my Soul, my Tears did'st dry, My Feet from falling stay; 9I'll walk before the Lord, till I Shall see no more the Day. 10I have believ'd and therefore spake, True, I was sorely try'd; 11When I in haste my Flight did take, All Men are false, I cry'd. Part II. 12To God what Off'ring shall I make For Gifts on me bestow'd? 13The Cup of Blessing I will take, And spread his Praise abroad. 14I to the Lord my Vows will pay, In Publick with delight; 15The Death of Saints, who him obey, Is precious in his Sight. 16Thy Servant, Lord, thy Servant, sure Thy Handmaid's Son am I; Thou did'st my Freedom to procure, My shameful Bonds unty. 17The Sacrifice of Thanks to Thee, I'll give, to Thee I'll pray; 18Now all th' assembled Tribes shall see, To Thee my Vows I'll pay. 19Lord, in thy Courts I'll offer them, The Courts of thy Abode, In mid'st of thee, Jerusalem; Let all Jehovah laud. Psalm CXIV. As the CXLVIII??. Another Metre. 1 O how I love the Lord! How much is he endear'd? For, when I help implor'd, He my Petitions heard. 2Since he did give Ear, when I pray'd, I'll ask his Aid, While here I live. 3The Woes and Pains of Death Encompass'd me around, I drew in Sobs my Breath, I Grief and Trouble found. 4Thus near the Grave, I cry'd to Thee, Lord, succour me, Help, Lord, and save. 5The Lord is good and kind, And righteous are his Ways, Yea still, our God, we find, Thy Mercies Wonder raise: 6The Weak from Woe The Lord sets free, He succour'd me, When brought down low. 7My Soul now thankful-be, Return to Peace and Rest; For sure the Lord to thee Great Goodness has exprest. 8From Death-like Pain Thou mad'st me rise, Did'st dry my Eyes, My Feet sustain. 9Before the Lord I'll walk, Long as I live, of Thee 10My Saviour I did talk; Great was my Misery. 11When forc'd to fly, I thus disgrac'd, Said in my haste, All Men will ly. Part II. 12What Thanks shall I, most High, For all thy Bounty pay? 13The Cup of Blessing I Will take, and to Thee pray. 14Lord Gracious, now The Tribes I'll call, Before them all I'll pay my Vow. 15The Death of ev'ry Saint Is precious in thy Sight, 16Lord, I, which Thou wilt grant, Thy Servant am by right. Thy Servant, see, My Self I own, Thy Handmaid's Son, Thou mad'st me free. 17I'll offer to the Lord The Sacrifice of Praise, And on his Name ador'd Will call thro' all my Days. Lord Gracious, now The Tribes I'll call, Before them all I'll pay my Vow. 19Let them, when they are found In the blest Courts, O God, Whose Buildings compass round Thy sanctify'd Abode. In mid'st of Thee, O Salem high, There glorify The Lord with me. Psalm CXVII. 1 O all ye Gentile Lands give ear, Ye People praise the Lord; Let Him by Kingdoms far and near Be lauded and ador'd. 2Great Mercy He, to us has shown, Which we with Thanks proclaim; His Truth to fail is never known, For ever praise his Name. Psalm CXVIII. 1 Give Thanks to God, for He is Good, His Promises are sure, His Mercy, which has firmly stood, For ever shall endure. 2Let Israel say, his Faithfulness For ever is secure; 3Let Aaron's House aloud confess His Mercies still endure. 4Let all, by whom the Lord is fear'd, Declare his Mercy's sure; As they in all Times firm appear'd, They ever shall endure. 5Distress'd I cry'd, the Lord did hear, And to enlarge me flew; 6Since God is for me, shall I fear? What is it Man can do? 7The mighty Lord takes Part with those, Who are for me combin'd; Hence my Desire upon my Foes Accomplish'd I shall find. 8On God 'tis better to rely, Than Troops in Battle try'd; 9To Him in Streights you safer fly; Than you in Kings confide. 10All Nations did combin'd agree To compass me around; But whilst I put my Trust in Thee, I shall my Foes confound. 11Around the Nations compass'd me, They compass'd me around, But whilst I put my Trust in Thee, I shall my Foes confound. 12Like Bees they compass'd me in Swarms, Like Fire of Thorns they die, For in thy Name, O Lord, my Arms Shall slay the Enemy. Part II. 13Sore was I push'd by threat'ning Foes, But God did Succour bring; 14From God, my Strength, Salvation flows, Hence I'll his Praises sing. 15The Just raise Shouts of Victory, Renown'd is God's Right-hand; 16The Lord's Right-hand do's valiantly, And Conquest still command. 17I shall not dye, but live to be In praising God employ'd; 18He has severely chasten'd me, But not in Wrath destroy'd. 19Open the Gates of Righteousness, That I may enter there, And to the Lord due Thanks express, And offer Praise and Pray'r. 20God's Gate, by which the Just are free To pass and enter in: 21I'll bless Thee, who hast answer'd me, And my Salvation been. Part III. 22The Stone, the Builders have in Scorn Rejected, as unfit, As Head the Corner do's adorn, And fast the Structure knit. 23This great Design by God was laid, 'Tis wond'rous in our Eyes; 24Let us this Day, which he has made, In Triumph solemnize. 25Now let us thy Salvation see, We Thee beseech, O Lord, And send us that Prosperity, Which we have now implor'd. 26O bless'd be He, who in the Name Of God comes full of Grace; We Priests his People blest proclaim, From God's most holy Place. 27God is the Lord, who just and kind To bless us Light affords, Then to the sacred Altar bind The Sacrifice with Cords. 28Thou art my God and Lord, my Will Is bent to praise thy Name: 29O bless him for he's good, and still His Mercies are the same. Psalm CXIX. ALEPH. 1 Blest are the pure, who fear the Lord, Nor from his Law depart; 2Happy are they, who keep his Word, And seek Him with their Heart. 3They, with Iniquity unstain'd, Ne'er from his Precepts swerve, 4Who by his Sov'raign Pow'r ordain'd The Laws we should observe. 5O that my Ways were, Lord most high, To please Thee, order'd right, 6Then should I know no Shame, when I In thy whole Will delight. 7I'll praise Thee with an upright Heart, When I have learn'd thy Word, 8Nor from thy Statutes will depart; Forsake me not, O Lord. Part II. BETH. 9By what shall Youth cleanse Life and Thought? Let them thy Word obey: 10With my whole Heart, I Thee have sought, From Thee ne'er let me stray. 11I hide thy Precepts in my Breast, That I no Guilt may know: 12Thou art, O Lord, for ever blest, To me thy Statutes show. 13My Lips, of thy just Precepts spake, And taught thy Judgments right; 14I in thy Statutes Pleasure take, Wealth yields not such Delight. 15On thy Commands I'll meditate, And all thy Ways respect; 16Thy Statutes shall my Joy create, I'll not thy Word neglect. Part III. GIMEL. 17Be bountiful, nor let me die, So I'll thy Will obey; 18Do Thou, to my inlighten'd Eye, Thy wond'rous Law display. 19I am a Stranger here below, Thy Will to me convey; 20My Soul with longing breaks, to know Thy Judgments, all the Day. 21The Proud accurst, Thou didst reprove, Who from thy Statutes swerve; 22Reproach and Shame from me remove, For I thy Laws observe. 23Against me, whilst the Great inveigh, Thy Word my Thoughts employ; 24Thy Precepts I devoutly weigh, My Counsellours and Joy. Part IV. DALETH. 25Down to the Dust my Soul is prest, As faithful, quicken me; 26Thou heard'st, when I my Ways confest, Let me thy Statutes see. 27Let me thy Precepts fully know, I'll tell thy Works at large, 28Strengthen my Soul, that melts with Woe, And thus thy Word discharge. 29My Mind from Ways of Falsehood free, Clear let thy Law be made; 30Truth is my Choice, and thy Decree, Before me I have laid. 31I resolute did Thee obey, Let Shame from me depart; 32That I may run thy righteous Way, Do Thou enlarge my Heart. Part V. HE. 33Thy righteous Precepts to me show, And they my Life shall sway; Thy sacred Statutes let me know, And I will keep thy Way. 34To make me understand thy Law, In Mercy condescend; To keep it then, with holy Awe, My Heart entire I'll bend. 35That from thy Paths I may not stray, Direct my Steps aright; Guide and instruct me in thy Way, In which I take Delight. 36Bow to thy Word my Heart, restrain Each covetous Desire; 37Turn off my Eyes from Objects vain, To serve Thee, Zeal inspire. 38Thy Promise made to me assert, Thy Greatness I revere; 39Let fear'd Reproach from me depart, Thy Righteousness is clear. 40Thy Precepts, I appeal to Thee, I've thirsted for, O Lord; In thy great Mercy quicken me, According to thy Word. Part VI. VAU. 41The Mercies and Salvation, Thou Hast promis'd, let me see; 42An Answer thus to those allow, Who mock my Trust in Thee. 43My Shame, Lord, never let it cause, To say, that Thou art true: 44Thy Word's my Hope and to thy Laws, I'll still Obedience shew. 45And from my Streights enlarg'd I'll break, For I thy Precepts trace; 46I'll of thy Testimonies speak Before a Prince's Face. 47In thy Commands I'll Pleasure take, Which I did still approve, 48Them I'll my Rule of Practice make, To think on them I love. Part VII. ZAIN. 49Remember, Lord, thy plighted Word, On which my Hope relies, 50Which Comfort do's in Streights afford, New Life and Strength supplies. 51The Proud have mock'd and me despis'd, From Thee I have not err'd; 52Thy former Judgments I revis'd, Which Peace on me confer'd. 53Grief on my Soul did heavy lie, To see Vice Lawless reign; 54Thy Statutes were my Songs, when I A Pilgrim pass'd the Plain. 55On Thee I thought, when others sleep, And thence observ'd thy Law; 56This Good I gain'd, because I keep Thy Word with filial Awe. Part VIII. CHETH. 57Thou art my Portion, Lord, I said, Thy Words to me are dear; 58With my whole Heart, for Grace I pray'd, Draw Thou in Mercy near. 59I thought on my Demeanour past, And turn'd to Thee my Way, 60Nor linger'd, but press'd on in haste, Thy Precepts to obey. 61I in thy Word, when forc'd to live Mid'st Spoilers, did delight: 62I'll rise at Midnight Thanks to give, For Laws, that guide me right. 63I, a Companion am of all, Who fear and keep thy Word; 64Freely on Earth thy Blessings fall; Teach me thy Will, O Lord. Part IX. TETH. 65According to thy Promise past, Lord, Thou hast me reliev'd; 66Give me a just discerning Taste; Thy Word I still believ'd. 67I err'd 'ere Woe I understood, But now I keep thy Way; 68Lord, Thou art Good, and workest Good, Let me thy Laws obey. 69Tho' Foes against me Lies employ, I'll serve Thee with my Might; 70Their Heart is fat and full of Joy, Thy Word is my Delight. 71'Tis Good that I Affliction bore, That I thy Will might see: 72Thy Laws are more than Golden Oar, And Silver Mines to me. Part X. JOD. 73Thou mad'st me, Lord, to Thee I bow, The Creature of thy Hands; With Understanding me endow, To learn thy just Commands. 74They will rejoyce, who fear the Lord, To see me live secure, While my Dependance on thy Word Unshaken shall endure. 75Right are thy Judgements, I confess, Thy Ways from Errour free; I know, O Lord, in Faithfulness Thou hast afflicted me. 76I Pray, when Troubles me invade, To Comfort me be kind; According to thy Promise made, Let me thy Mercy find. 77Let Mercy, Lord, my Death prevent, I'm to thy Law inclin'd; 78Blast the Perverse to hurt me bent, But I thy Statutes mind. 79Let those, that know his Word, and fear The Lord to me return; 80Be in his Laws my Heart sincere, Lest I in Shame should mourn. Part XI. CAPH. 81My Soul for thy Salvation faints, But I Will Hope in Thee; 82My mournful Eyes express their Wants, When wilt Thou comfort me? 83I'm like a Bottle in the Smoke, But ne'er thy Word forget; 84Sad are my Days, when will thy Stroke Reach them, who me beset? 85For me, the Proud against thy Laws, Dug Pits, and Snares have laid; 86Thy Rules are just, without a Cause They rage; be Thou my Aid 87On Earth they almost ruin'd me, But I ne'er left thy Law; 88Let me thy loving Kindness see, And I'll thy Will obey. Part XII. LAMED. 89Still, Lord, thy Word is fix'd in Heav'n, Thy Truth's for ever sure; 90Thou to the Earth hast Firmness giv'n, And it abides secure. 91They still thy Rules observe aright, For all thy Servants are; 92Had not thy Law been my Delight, I'd perish'd in Despair. 93I'll not forget thy Law divine, Which me new Life has brought; 94Save me, O Lord, for I am thine, And have thy Precepts sought. 95The wicked Tribe my Fall intend, But I thy Statutes mind; 96I've seen of worldly Bless an end, Thy Law is unconfin'd. Part XIII. MEM. 97O how I love thy Word, which Night And Day, my Study grows! 98By thy Commands still in my Sight, I'm wiser than my Foes. 99My Teachers I in Light outvie, For I thy Statutes weigh'd; 100Grey Heads know not so much as I, For I thy Will obey'd. 101With Care I shun'd each evil Way, That I might keep thy Word; 102Nor from thy Judgmeuts went astray, For Thou hast taught me, Lord. 103Thy Words are sweeter to my Mind, Than Honey to my Taste; 104I thro' thy Precepts Knowledge find, Nor have false Ways embrac'd. Part XIV. NUN. 105Thy Word's a Lamp my Feet to guide, A Light to lead my Way; 106Lord, I have sworn, and fix'd abide Thy Precepts to obey. 107I'm sore afflicted, succour me, According to thy Word; 108Accept my Thanks, my Off'rings free, Teach me thy Judgments, Lord. 109Tho' threat'ning Dangers me surround, From Truth I have not swerv'd; 110With Snares the Wicked spread the Ground, Yet I thy Law observ'd. 111Thy Word my Portion still I chose, Which fills with Joy my Heart; 112I still with Care my Mind dispose, Ne'er from thy Ways to start. Part XV. SAMECH. 113Vain Thoughts my Soul has still abhor'd, But loves thy Judgments just; 114Thou art my Shield and Refuge, Lord, And in thy Word I Trust. 115Depart, ye Wicked, from my Court, To keep God's Laws I Aim; 116Let promis'd Aid my Life support, Nor blast my Hope with Shame. 117Uphold me, then in Safety plac'd I'll keep thy Word with Care; 118Thou proud Transgressours hast debas'd, Whose Falsehood is their Snare. 119Thou from the Earth dost Sinners take, Like Dross; thy Law I love; 120In awful Fear of Thee I shake, Thy Judgments Terrour move. Part XVI. AIN. 121Still I have Just and Right decreed, Ne'er leave me to my Foe; 122My Surety be, that I, when freed, No more Oppression know. 123My Eyes for thy Salvation fail, And for thy righteous Word; 124Let Mercy often try'd prevail, Teach me thy Statutes, Lord. 125In me thy Servant, Light create, To learn thy Will employ'd; 126Tis Time thy Law to vindicate, For they have made it void. 127I therefore more thy Precepts love Than Gold, ev'n Gold refin'd; 128Thy Word in all Things I approve, And have false Ways declin'd: Part XVII. PE. 129Thy Laws Astonishment excite, Hence I'll Obedience show; 130Thy Words first Rudiments give Light, And make the Simple know. 131Thirsty for thy Commands I pant, And feel a longing Mind; 132Look on me, and that Mercy grant, Which those, who love Thee, find. 133Let not my Steps err from thy Word, Nor Sin have o'er me Sway; 134From proud Oppressours save me, Lord, So I'll thy Laws obey. 135Let thy pleas'd Face shine forth on me, Thy Statutes let me know; 136My Eyes shed Floods of Tears to see The People Wicked grow. Part XVIII. TSADDI. 137Thou, Lord, to Righteousness inclin'd Dost Judgments just pursue; 138And we thy Testimonies find Are faithful, right, and true. 139My Zeal consumes me, when I see My Foes thy Law despise: 140Thy Word which from Deceit is free, I greatly love and prize. 141Tho' I am mean and in Distress, My Soul thy Precepts awe; 142Eternal is thy Righteousness, And Truth it self thy Law. 143Tho' Grief and Anguish hold me fast, Thy Precepts Pleasure give; 144Thy righteous Rules for ever last, Teach me, and I shall live. Part XIX. KOPH. 145With my whole Heart, Lord, hear, I cry'd, And I'll thy Word obey; 146Be not thy Help to me deny'd, And I will keep thy Way. 147'Ere Morning dawn'd, my Cry I sent, Thou art my Hope, O Lord; 148And the Night Watches I prevent, Contemplating thy Word. 149My Voice in loving Kindness hear, As usual quicken me; 150Foes who design me Ill, draw near, Foes who are far from Thee. 151But Thou art nigh me to uphold, And Truth are thy Commands; 152As for thy Law, I know of old, It fix'd for ever stands. Part XX. RESH. 153Regard my Woe, I Succour want, For by thy Laws I'm sway'd; 154Lord, plead my Cause, Deliv'rance grant, And send thy promis'd Aid. 155They shall not see Salvation, who Against thy Statutes strive; 156Great is thy Love, as Thou art true, And just, my Soul revive. 157Tho' num'rous Foes encompass me, I to thy Word incline; 158In Grief did I Transgressours see To break thy Laws combine. 159To thy Commands what Love I shew? Grant me thy promis'd Aid; 160Thy Word, when first reveal'd, was true, Nor shall thy Judgments fail. Part XXI. SCHIN. 161Lords without Cause upon me run, But I thy Laws obey; 162I at thy Word rejoyce, as one That finds an ample Prey. 163Deceit and Falsehood I detest, But thy pure Statutes love; 164Sev'n Times a Day thy Name I blest, Whose Judgments righteous prove. 165Great Peace have they, that love thy Laws, Whom nothing shall offend; 166From God I hop'd for Help, because My Will to His I bend. 167My Soul thy pure Commands obeys, I love and keep thy Word: 168This Thou do'st see, for all my Ways Are in thy Sight, O Lord. Part XXII. TAU. 169Lord, let my Cry come near thy Throne, Let me in Wisdom grow; 170My earnest Supplication own, And promis'd Goodness show. 171I with my Lips shall utter Praise, If taught thy Statutes first; 172My Tongue shall laud thy faithful Ways, For all thy Laws are Just. 173Lord, Help against the Wicked grant, Thy Precepts are my Choice; 174For thy Salvation, see, I pant, And in thy Law rejoyce. 175Save me, and I'll thy Praise display, Thy Succour let me find; 176Seek me, a Sheep that's gone astray, For thy Commands I mind. Psalm. CXX. 1 Griev'd to the Lord I cry'd, and He Did hear me, and redress my Wrong, 2From lying Lips deliver me, And from a treach'rous, double Tongue. 3What Good false Tongue wilt thou acquire? What Benefits will Lies confer? 4Th' Almighty's Darts and wrathful Fire, That burns, like Coals of Juniper. 5Ah, Woe is me! I've often cry'd, That I with barb'rous Men remain, Ev'n such as Mesech's Land divide, And pitch'd the Tent in Kedar's Plain. 6Long I have dwelt with those, that love Continual Strife, and Peace abhor; 7I still did friendly Ways approve; I spoke for Peace, but they for War. Psalm CXXI. 1 I'll to the Hills lift up my Eyes, Whence comes expected Aid; 2On God alone my Hope relies, Who Heav'n and Earth has made. 3No Mischief shall thy Foot ensnare, Thy Guardian never sleeps; 4Nor dos he slumber, who with Care His Chosen Israel keeps. 5Thy Saviour, Lord, thy Shade, do's stay Thy Shelter on the Right, 6Thou shalt escape the Sun by Day, Nor fear the Moon by Night: 7Whatever Dangers near Thee come, God will thy Life assure; 8Abroad defend Thee, and at Home Still keep thy Peace secure. Psalm CXXII. 1 I triumph'd, when to me they cry'd, To Zion let us go; 2We shall in Salem's Gates abide, His Dwelling-place below. 3 Jerusalem's a City fair, Compacted is her Frame, 4Where to the Ark his Tribes repair, To thank the Almighty's Name, 5Behold the Thrones of Judgment there, The Thrones of David's House; 6Pray for her Peace, they prosp'rous are, Who her just Cause espouse. 7Within thy Walls, let Joy and Ease, O Salem, constant reign, And in thy stately Palaces, Prosperity remain. 8I for my Friends and People's Sake, Will say be Salem blest; 9Since God do's thee his Dwelling make, I'll seek thy Peace and Rest. Psalm CXXIII. 1 I to the Lord lift up my Eyes, Who dwells enthron'd in Light, Mid'st the wide Chambers of the Skies Of unsurmounted Height. 2See, as the Servant-Man and Maid, Look to the Master's Hand, And mind the Mistress, so for Aid On Thee we waiting stand. 3Shew Mercy to us, Lord, for we Are mock'd and laugh'd to Scorn, 4And while the Proud from Cares are free, Their Insults we have born. Psalm CXXIV. 1 Had not the Lord, let Israel own, Withstood his Peoples Foes, 2Had not the Lord Salvation shown, When Men against us rose; 3Then surely they had us devour'd, When their fierce Anger glow'd; 4The Flood of Waters, on us pour'd, Our Soul had overflow'd. 5To whelm us o'er without Controul, Proud Floods had made their Way; 6Bless God, who did not give our Soul To their sharp Teeth a Prey. 7Our Soul, as from a broken Snare A Bird escapes, is fled; 8Our Help is from th' Almighty's Care, Who Earth and Heav'n has spread. Psalm CXXV. 1 The Righteous, who in God confide, Are like Mount Zion's Frame, Which is unmov'd, and will abide For evermore the same. 2As shelt'ring Hills in Air sublime Round Salem's Walls ascend, So God his People, from this Time, For ever shall defend. 3Th' Oppressour's Rod shall not annoy Your Lot, ye Righteous, long, Lest you should evil Means employ, To remedy your Wrong. 4We earnestly beseech Thee, Lord, With Good the Good requite, And to the People Help afford, Who are of Heart upright. 5They, who shall crooked Ways resume, With Criminals shall go, Led forth by Thee, Lord, to their Doom; But Israel Peace shall know. Psalm CXXVI. 1 When God releas'd us from our Foes, We felt Surprize extream, Which from such great Salvation rose, It seem'd a pleasing Dream. 2Then in our Souls Delight began, Our Tongue glad Praises spake; The Heathen cry'd, the Lord hath done Great Things for Israel's sake. 3For us He did his mighty Hand In wond'rous Works employ, He led us from a Foreign Land; Which fill'd our Hearts with Joy. 4In Mercy, break our Brethren's Chains, Who yet in Bondage live, Which will, like Streams in Southern Plains, To us great Pleasure give. 5Joyful they'll reap, who weeping sow; They that go forth and mourn, 6While precious Seed on Fields they throw, Shall crown'd with Sheaves return. Psalm CXXVII. 1 In vain great Pains the Builder takes, Except the Lord the House erect; In vain th' entrusted Watchman wakes, Except the Lord the Town protect. 2You labour Night and Day in vain, And eat the Bread of Carefulness; For God, without such Care and Pain, Those, whom he loves, with Rest will bless. 3Lord, Children are thy Heritage, And the Womb's Fruit thy Blessings are 4And Sons, the Flow'r of youthful Age, May with the Champion's Darts compare. 5He's happy, whose full Quivers hold Such Strength, they no Confusion dread, But in the Courts of Justice bold Their Cause against th' Accuser plead. Psalm CXXVIII. 1 He's blest, who fears the Lord most Great, And walks in his pure Ways; 2Thou of thy Toil the Fruit shall eat, And prosper all thy Days. 3Thy Wife shall, as the Vine, appear, With which thy House is crown'd; Like Olive Plants, thy Children dear, Thy Table shall surround. 4He's blest who fears the Lord, who thee Will out of Zion bless; And thou shall all thy Life-time see Jerusalem's Success. 6Yea with Delight thou shalt behold Thy Childrens Progeny, While Peace, thro' all the Tribes enroll'd, Shall fix'd in Israel be. Psalm CXXIX. 1 Oft from my Youth, may Israel cry, My Foes have me assail'd, 2Did from my Youth to crush me try, But never have prevail'd. 3Deep on my Back Oppressours plow'd, My Flesh long Furrows bore; 4But God with Faithfulness endow'd, Their Cords asunder tore. 5Let all, who Zion hate, their Hopes Destroy'd, in Terror fly; 6Let them as Grass on Houses Tops, 'Ere ripe, decay and dy: 7Of which the Mower cannot find Enough to fill his Hands, And he, that waits the Sheaves to bind, With empty Bosom stands. 8Nor do's the Trav'ller passing by E're from the Road exclaim; God send you all Prosperity, We bless you in his Name. Psalm CXXX. 1 I from the Depths of Woe did cry, To me, O Lord, give Ear; 2Do not my earnest Pray'r deny, My Voice attentive hear. 3Lord should'st Thou mark Iniquity, Who blamless could appear? 4But, Lord, Forgiveness is with Thee, That Men thy Name may fear. 5My Soul do's Wait for Thee, O Lord, I look with eager Eyes; I wait unshaken for thy Word, On which my Hope relies. 6More for the Lord I wait, than they, Who watch the Morning Light; Ev'n more than those, again I say, Who watch the Morning bright. 7Trusting in God, O Israel, live, With Him are Love and Grace; 8Plenteous Redemption he will give, And Israel's Sins efface. Psalm CXXXI. 1 A haughty Heart, Lord, I disown, Nor lofty are my Eyes, Nor do to Greatness and Renown, My Thoughts ambitious rise. 2I, as a Child, my Self demean'd, Took from the Mother's Breast; My Soul ev'n as a Child, that's wean'd, Submits, and is at Rest. 3Let Israel place in God most high Their Hope, his Aid implore, And on His tender Care rely, Henceforth for evermore. Psalm CXXXII. 1 Lord, David in Remembrance bear, And all his Woe, till now; 2And how to Jacob's God he sware, And made a solemn Vow. 3I from my House shall Absence chuse, Nor on my Bed will lie, 4My wakeful Eyes shall Sleep refuse, Slumber my Eye-lids flie: 5Till I shall find for Thee, O Lord, A sacred Dwelling-place, Where Thou may'st always be ador'd, Great God of Jacob's Race. 6Then shall the Ark long Rest possess, Which was in Ephraim found, And which did late the City bless, Nam'd from the Woods around. 7We to his House will go and bow Before his Throne at length; 8Into thy Seat, Lord, enter Thou, And thy blest Ark of Strength. 9In Righteousness thy Priests array, Let Saints loud Joy proclaim; 10For David's Sake turn not away Thy Servant's Face in Shame. Part II. 11God has in Truth to David sworn, Nor will his Word disown, The Sons to my Anointed born, I'll set upon thy Throne. 12And if they keep my Covenant, And my Decrees maintain, I'll also to their Children grant An everlasting Reign. 13For God has chosen Zion's Hill A Dwelling to him dear, 14And said, this is my Rest, and still I will inhabit here. 15I'll make her plenteous Stores possess, With Bread the Poor I'll cloy; 16Her Priests with my Salvation bless, And fill her Saints with Joy. 17There David's Horn shall flourish, there Shall rule his favour'd Line. 18I'll crush his Foes, but by my Care, On him his Crown shall shine. Psalm CXXXIII. 1 Behold, how good it is and sweet, How pleasant do's it prove, When Fellow Subjects friendly meet, And dwell in Peace and Love? 2'Tis like the Oyle of fragrant Smell Pour'd forth on Aaron's Head, Which down his Hair and Bosom fell, And o'er his Garment spread. 3Sweet as the Dew on Hermon's Brows, Or that which Zion cheers, Where his chief Blessing God bestows, E'en Life to endless Years. Psalm CXXXIV. 1 Behold, all ye my Words invite, Ye Servants of the Lord, Who in his House attend by Night, Bless him with one Accord. 2Lift up, to praise Jehovah's Name, Your Hands in Holiness; 3The Lord, that Heav'n and Earth did frame, Thee out of Zion bless. Psalm CXXXV. As the L??. 1 Jehovah Laud, Extol his Holy Name, Ye Priests, applaud The Lord, and raise his Fame. 2All ye, that wait In God's blest House, and who Within his Gate (Pay your Attendance due.) 3God's Praise proclaim, For he is good and kind; Praise ye his Name, Which a sweet Task you'll find. 4He in great Grace Chose Jacob for his own, And to his Race Peculiar Love has shown. 5God is ador'd As Great, I know it well, And that our Lord Do's all the Gods excel. 6The Lord, 'tis known, Can do whate'er he please, In Heav'n his Throne, In Earth, deep Caves and Seas. 7Amidst the Air He secret Vapours sends, Which gather there From Earth's remotest Ends. His Lightning's Force For Rain the Clouds unbinds, He from their Source, His Storehouse, brings the Winds. 8Whose vengeful Hand The first-born Man and Beast Smote in the Land, Where Jacob was opprest. 9Who made Thee see, O Egypt, Wonders wrought, And Plagues on thee And thine, O Pharoah, brought. 10Who Nations great Thy Enemies did slay, And Kings defeat, Whose Arms oppos'd thy Way. 11He Sihon slew, That rul'd the Amorite, Did Og subdue, And Canaan's Lords in Fight. 12And gave the Land By Heathen Pow'rs possest To Israel's Hand, His People's Portion blest. 13O Lord thy Fame For ever shall endure, And of thy Name The Memory is sure. Part II. 14For God, our Strength, To judge his Tribes is bent, And will at length Concerning us repent. 15Silver and Gold The Heathen Idols are, Figures, behold, The Manufact'rers Ware. 16They've Mouths, 'tis known, But not in Speech employ'd; And Eyes they own, That never Sight enjoy'd. 17They Ears possess, That never heard a Note, Lips Motionless, And without Breath a Throat. 18They, who did frame. These Works, and to them pray, And Favour claim, As stupid are as they. 19The Lord above, O House of Jacob, bless; The Lord's great Love O Aaron's House confess. 20Be Praise sincere By Levi's House addrest, By them, that fear The Lord, the Lord be blest. 21From Zion's Height Blest be the Lord our God, Who takes Delight In Salem his Abode. Another Metre. 1 Praise ye the Lord, praise ye his Name, To Heav'n your Praises send, 2Who in his House a Station claim, And in his Courts attend. 3O spread the Almighty's Praise abroad, For he is good and kind, Sing fervent Praises to our God, For this you'll pleasant find. 4For to himself the Lord, you see, Distinguish'd Jacob chose, And as peculiar Treasure he Great Love to Israel shows. 5Our God above all Gods is Great, 6He do's whate'er he please, In all the Earth, in Heav'n above, Deep Places and the Seas. 7He raise Vapours from the Main And Land, for Clouds design'd; From thence he Light'nings brings and Rain And from his Stores the Wind. 8He all thy first-born Egypt smote, 9Sent Wonders thro' thy Coast, And fearful Plagues on Pharoah brought, And Vengeance on his Host. 10He smote great Realms, great Princes slew, Sihon the Amorite, 11Did Bashan's King strong Og subdue, And Canaan's Lords in Fight. 12And he their Land the Heritage Of chosen Jacob made: 13His Name will ne'er in any Age, Nor his Memorial fade. Part II. 14The Lord to his own People kind Will judge them, and relent; He will express a gracious Mind, And of his Wrath repent. 15The Gods ador'd by Heathen Lands, Are Gold and Silver wrought, The Labour of the Artist's Hands, And Creatures of his Thought. 16The've Lips, but not to speak employ'd, And Eyes, but dark as Death; 17They've Ears that never Sounds enjoy'd, And Mouths, but without Breath. 18They, who these Idols make, and all That at their Altars pray, And for Protection on them call, As stupid are as they. 19The Lord, O House of Israel, bless, Let Aaron's spread his Fame; 20O House of Levi Thanks express, Ye Righteous bless his Name. 21In Zion Praise to God repeat, In Salem still ador'd, Salem, his Holy chosen Seat, Sing Praises to the Lord. Psalm CXXXVI. 1 To God most good Hymns thankful sing, For ever are his Mercies sure: 2Give Thanks to God of Gods the King, His Mercies evermore endure. 3Hymns to the Lord of Lords compose, For ever are his Mercies sure: 4For he alone great Wonders shows, His Mercies evermore endure. 5Whose Wisdom gave the Heav'ns their Birth; For ever are his Mercies sure: 6And o'er the Waters stretch'd the Earth, His Mercies evermore endure. 7Who bade great Lights their Beams display; For ever are his Mercies sure; 8The glorious Sun to rule by Day: His Mercies evermore endure. 9The Moon and Stars to rule by Night; For ever are his Mercies sure: 10Who did proud Egypt's first born smite; His Mercies evermore endure. 11Who Israel brought from Pharoah's Land; For ever are his Mercies sure; 12With a strong Arm and out-stretch'd Hand; His Mercies evermore endure. Part II. 13Who the Red Sea asunder rent; For ever are his Mercies sure: 14Thro' which his People fearless went; His Mercies evermore endure. 15But did the Waves o'er Pharoah spread; For ever are his Mercies sure: 16And thro' the Desart Israel led; His Mercies evermore endure. 17Who did great Lords and Princes smite; For ever are his Mercies sure: 18And vanquish'd Kings of dreaded Might: His Mercies evermore endure. 19 Sihon by Amorites obey'd; For ever are his Mercies sure: 20And Og, who Bashan's Scepter sway'd; His Mercies evermore endure. 21And gave their Lands a Dwelling-place; For ever are his Mercies sure: 22A Heritage to Israel's Race; His Mercies evermore endure. 23Who succour'd us, when mean and low; For ever are his Mercies sure; 24And hath redeem'd us from the Foe; His Mercies evermore endure. 25Who do's with Food all Flesh supply; For ever are his Mercies sure; 26O render Thanks to God most High; His Mercies evermore endure. Another Metre. 1 To God, for he is Good, Give Thanks with all your Souls; 2Thank him, who for you stood, The God, that Gods controuls. His Mercies sure Just Themes of Praise To endless Days Unchang'd endure. 3Thanks to Jehovah pay, To God, of Kings the King; The Lord, whom Lords obey, For ever Praises sing. His Mercies sure Just Themes of Praise To endless Days Unchang'd endure. 4To him, whose Pow'r alone Great Wonders has display'd; 5To him, who his high Throne The Heav'ns, by Wisdom made. His Mercies sure Just Themes of Praise To endless Days Unchang'd endure. 6To him, who has the Land Above the Waters rear'd; 7To him by whose Command Great Lights in Heav'n appear'd. His Mercies sure Just Themes of Praise To endless Days Unchang'd endure. 8The Sun to Rule by Day, 9The Moon and Stars by Night; 10Who in a dreadful Way Did Egypt's first-born smite. His Mercies sure Just Themes of Praise To endless Days Unchang'd endure. 11Who, from that cruel Land Brought Jacob safe from Harm, 12With a resistless Hand, And with an out-stretch'd Arm. His Mercies sure Just Themes of Praise To endless Days Unchang'd endure. Part II. 13Who bade the Sea divide For Israel's Host its Flood; 14That they might pass the Tide, In Heaps the Waters stood. His Mercies sure Just Themes of Praise To endless Days Unchang'd endure. 15Who Seas o'er Pharoah spread, And overthrew his Host; 16Who thro' the Desart led His Tribes to Canaan's Coast. His Mercies sure Just Themes of Praise To endless Days Unchang'd endure. 17Who Princes fam'd for Might 18Did to Destruction bring, 19 Sihon the Amorite, 20And Bahan's Giant King. His Mercies sure Just Themes of Praise To endless Days Unchang'd endure. 21An Heritage their Lands, An Heritage decreed, 22He gave to Jacob's Hands, And fix'd them on his Seed. His Mercies sure Just Themes of Praise To endless Days Unchang'd endure. 23Who in our low Estate Our suffring Tribes reliev'd, 24And sav'd us from the Hate Of Foes that Israel griev'd. His Mercies sure Just Themes of Praise To endless Days Unchang'd endure. 25Who freely Man and Beast With needful Food supplies, Be Thanks to God addrest, Enthron'd amidst the Skies. His Mercies sure Just Themes of Praise To endless Days Unchang'd endure. Psalm CXXXVII. 1 By Babel's Streams we sat, and wept When, Zion, we remember'd thee. 2Our useless Harps, which long had slept, We hung upon the Willow Tree. 3For they, who did us Captive bring, Desir'd our tuneful Art to hear; And they, who spoil'd us, bade us sing One of the Songs to Zion dear. 4 Jehovah's Song how could we set, And sing it in a Stranger's Land? 5If I, O Salem, thee forget, May tuneful Skill leave my Right Hand. 6Should I neglect Thee, or should I, Than Thee, a dearer Pleasure know, Then let my fault'ring Tongue grow dry, Cleave to my Roof, and speechless grow. 7O Lord, remember Edom's Race, Who in Jerusalem's sad Day, Said rase it, rase it, this vile Place To its Foundations level lay. 8To Ruin doom'd, O Babylon, The mighty Man shall happy be, Who as thy Sons to us have done, With just Revenge shall do to thee. 9May Blessings ne'er the Man forsake The Conq'rour, who thy Woes shall mock, And merciless thy Children take, And dash their Heads against the Rock. Another Metre. 1 While on the Streams of Babylon We sad and pensive sate, We sorely wept when we begun To think on Zion's State. 2All Joy and Mirth we now detest, Our Instruments unstrung, Our Harps we now with Woe opprest Upon the Willows hung. 3The Lords, who Israel Captive led, Did Hymns of us require, And let us hear, our Spoilers said, A Song of Zion's Quire. 4In a strange Land the Song desir'd Our Pleasure can't produce; Shall we profane a Song inspir'd By God for Zion's Use? 5If ever I, Jerusalem, Exclude thee from my Heart, Let my Right Hand, which I'll condemn, Forget its tuneful Art. 6Should I neglect Thee, and not show Thou art my greatest Joy, Dry let my Tongue and tasteless grow, And Speech no more employ. 7Lord, Edom's cruel Sons confound, Who said in Salem's Day, Now rase it, rase it, to the Ground Her Buildings level lay. 8To Ruin doom'd proud Babylon, O happy let him be, Who, as thy Sons to us have done, Enrag'd shall do to thee. 9Let Blessings ne'er the Man forsake, Who shall thy Ruin mock, And in his Wrath thy Children take, And dash them on the Rock. Psalm CXXXVIII. 1 With my whole Heart the Thanks I owe I'll pay, and Praises sing, Before great Princes Gods below, To God, my God and King. 2Towards the Ark will I bow down, Thy Love and Truth record; 3Thou above all thy Name do'st crown, And magnify thy Word. Thou, when I cry'd did'st answer me, And free my Soul from Fear; 4All Kings on Earth shall worship thee, When they thy Words shall hear. 5They in thy Ways shall joyful go, For great thy Glories are; 6The Lord, tho' high, respects the Low, But knows the Proud from far. 7Thou'lt raise me, tho' distrest I lie, Against the wicked Band, Thou sendest forth thy Hand, and I Am sav'd by thy Right Hand. 8What me concerns Thou'lt perfect make, Thy Mercies Time outrun; Do not the Work, O Lord, forsake By thy own Hand begun. Psalm CXXXIX. 1 Thou try'st and know'st me, Lord, my Hope, 2Thou do'st my Secrets learn, My lying down and rising up, My Thoughts from far discern. 3Thou see'st and compassest about My Raths, and Lying down; Thou all my Footsteps findest out, And all my Ways hast known. 4Words by my Tongue not utter'd yet Thou, Lord, do'st understand; 5Me ev'ry way Thou hast beset, And on me laid thy Hand. 6Knowledge so wonderful and great I strive to grasp in vain, It dwells in such a lofty Seat, I can't its Height attain. 7Where can I hide, that I thy Sight And Spirit may elude? Or to what Place direct my Flight, That, Lord, can Thee exclude? 8If I ascend to Heav'n on High, There Thou hast fix'd thy Throne; If in the Earth's low Beds I ly, Those Caves thy Presence own. 9If swifter, than the early Ray, That flies from East to West, From Thee, O Lord, I wing my Way To farthest Seas for Rest. 10Thy Hand in that remote Abode, Shall lead me all the Day, And thy Right-hand, all present God, Fast Hold shall on me lay. 11Shades, should I say, shall shelter me, They round me would be Light; 12Darkness would me reveal, to Thee Alike are Day and Night. 13For thou did'st, Lord, possess my Reins, Me in the Womb uphold, And my unfashion'd Flesh and Veins To cloath my Bones unfold. Part II. 14I'll praise Thee, for I'm fearfully, And full of Wonders wrought, Thy Works are marvellous, which I As certain still have thought. 15Thou me in Secret saw'st, before I yet was ripe for Birth, With curious Skill embroider'd o'er, As in the lowest Earth. 16Thou on my Limbs unform'd did'st look, And view'dst their growing Frame, And all were written in thy Book, 'Ere perfect one became. 17The Thoughts and Counsels of thy Mind Most precious I account; O what a vast Encrease they find? To what a Sum they mount? 18Should I their Number strive to take, They far surpass the Sand; And when from Slumber I awake, I still before Thee stand. 19Thou'lt slay the Wicked, from my Sight Fly bloody Men in Shame; 20They speak of God with impious Spite, And vilify his Name. 21Do's not true hatred fill my Heart To those, who Thee despise? Do I not griev'd the Men detest, Who, Lord, against Thee rise? 22I hate them with a perfect Hate, Who thy just Laws oppose, And all in such an impious State, I count my greatest Foes. 23Search me, O Lord, and know my Heart, My secret Thoughts survey; 24See if from Justice I depart, And lead me in thy Way. Another Metre. 1 Lord, Thou hast search'd my Soul and known, Thou do'st my inmost Motions learn, 2My Rising up, and Sitting down, And a far off my Paths discern. 3Thou compassest my Thoughts around, When on my Bed repos'd I lie, Thou do'st my Heart's deep Secrets sound And clearly all my Ways descry. 4Words by my Tongue not utter'd yet, Thou perfectly do'st understand; 5Me ev'ry Way Thou hast beset, And on me laid thy pow'rful Hand. 6Knowledge so wide, and so sublime, Where are the Wise, who me can teach? In vain my Soul attempts to climb To Heights so far above my Reach. 7Where can I go, that I thy Sight And boundless Spirit may elude? Or to what Place direct my Flight, That can thy Presence, Lord, exclude? 8If I ascend to Heav'n on High, There Thou art seated on thy Throne; If in the Earth's dark Beds I lie, The lowest Caves thy Presence own. 9If swifter than the Morning Ray, That darted flies from East to West, From Thee, O Lord, I wing my Way, And on the Ocean's Shore should rest; 10Ev'n there unseen I could not live, Thy Hand would find and lead me there: And thy Right-hand thy Fugitive Would seize, and disappoint my Care. 11Shades, should I say, would me conceal, Round me those Shades would Light display; 12Darkness would my Abode reveal, Alike to Thee are Night and Day. 13For Thou did'st Lord, possess my Reins, Me in my Mother's Womb uphold, Did'st form and spread my curious Veins, And Flesh to cover me unfold. Part II. 14The Wisdom, Goodness, and the Might, That our most artful Bodies show, My great Surprize and Fear excite, Thy Works are wond'rous, well I know. 15My Substance was discern'd by Thee, When hidden I grew ripe for Birth, Fashion'd with curious Imag'ry, As in low Caverns of the Earth. 16Me a rude Mass th' Almighty knew, My Limbs, their gradual Growth and Frame, Writ in his Book he had in view, 'Ere yet they into Being came. 17How much, O Lord, thy Thoughts I prize, And wise Designs of various Sort? To what a mighty Sum arise Thy Counsels, which are my Support? 18If I should count them they are more In Number, than the spreading Sand, When I awake I Thee adore, And still thy Works my Thoughts command. 19God surely will the Wicked slay, Then shun ye bloody Men my Sight; 20Of God most impious Things they say, And to prophane his Name delight. 21Against the Men, that hate the Lord, Dos not my Indignation rise? Are not the Race by me abhor'd, That his Authority despise? 22I hate them with a perfect Hate, Who dare the Lord most High oppose, And all in such an impious State, I rank among my greatest Foes. 23Search me, O Lord, and know my Heart, Try if my Thoughts in Errour stray; 24See, if from Justice I depart, And lead me in thy righteous Way. Another Metre. As the L??. 1 God searches me; 2He sees my Sitting down And Rising, he My Thoughts far off has known. 3Thou sift'st me, Lord, And do'st observe my Way; 4Thou ev'ry Word Ee'r utter'd do'st survey. 5Thou hast beset And on me laid thy Hand; 6Knowledge so great And high I can't command. 7To 'scape thy Face, Lord, whither shall I run, Or in what Place Can I thy Presence shun? 8If Heav'n on high I climb'd, Thou there art found; And if I lie In Hell, thou'lt me surround. 9Could I pretend To fly like Morning Light, To the World's End, For Shelter from thy Sight; 10Me in that Land Thy Hand would lead and bear, And thy right Hand Would, Lord, uphold me there. 11If I should say Black Shades will me conceal, Night will display Full Noon, and me reveal. 12Can Darkness me Screen from thy piercing Sight? O Lord, to Thee Alike are Day and Night. 13Thou did'st behold My Reins, my inmost Thought, And did'st unfold My Limbs in secret wrought. Part II. 14Thanks to the Lord, My Make do's Wonders show; Thy Works afford Astonishment, I know. 15Thou did'st remark My Frame unripe for Birth, Wrought in the dark, As in the lowest Earth. 16Thou saw'st me yet Unfashion'd by thy Plan, My Limbs compleat, 'Eer yet the Work began: 17How precious be, O God, thy Counsels wise, And Thoughts to me? To what a Sum they rise? 18Which should I take, They far surpass the Sand; When I awake, I still before Thee stand. 19Thou sure wilt slay The wicked Man, O God; Fly then away From me ye Men of Blood. 20With impious Lies God's Justice they arraign; Thy Enemies Take thy dread Name in vain. 21Hate fills my Breast To them, who Thee despise. I those detest, Who, Lord, against Thee rise. 22I perfect Hate Bear them, who Thee oppose; All in that State, I count my greatest Foes. 23Lord, search my Heart, My secret Thoughts survey, 24If I depart From Truth, shew me thy Way. Psalm CXL. 1 From th' evil Man, O save me, Lord, The Man of Violence, 2Who in his Heart do's Mischiefs hoard, And still new War commence. 3Sharp as a Serpent's piercing Sting, Their Tongues their Neighbours wound; Abroad they Adder's Poison fling, With which their Lips abound. 4Protection from the Wicked grant, And cruel, who combine, And aim my Goings to supplant, Lord, frustrate their Design. 5The Proud a Snare for me have set With mischievous Intent, And secretly have spread a Net In Ways, which I frequent. Thou art my God, I said, O Lord, The God I love and fear, Attention to my Voice afford, My Supplications hear. Thou Strength of my Salvation, Thou O God, the Lord of Might; Hast sav'd my threaten'd Head till now, And cover'd it in Fight, Part II. 8Th' Oppressours Will, Lord, do not grant, Nor his Devices bless, Lest he of Strength superiour vaunt, Exalted by Success. 9As for the Foes, who still surround, And almost me devour'd, Let, in their Lips, the Mischief found, On their own Heads be pour'd. 10Let Wrath Divine, like Coals of Fire, These harden'd Sinners burn; Let them in Pits sunk deep expire, And never thence return. 11Let not the vile ill-speaking Race At settled Peace arrive: Evil the Violent shall chase, And to Destruction drive. 12That God will succour, by his Might, Th' Afflicted in his Woe, And to the poor procure his Right, I by Experience know. 13Surely the Righteous Thanks shall give, And of thy Mercies tell; The Upright, who obedient live, Shall in thy presence dwell. Psalm CXLI. As the XXV??. 1 Lord hasten, and, when I Implore thy Aid, give Ear; In Mercy listen to my Cry, And my Petition hear. 2Lord, Let my Pray'r to Thee, As fragrant Incense, rise, And let my Hands uplifted be As Evening Sacrifice. 3Lord let thy Watch before My Mouth with Care attend, And of my Lips still keep the Door, That they may not offend. 4Bend not to Ill my Heart, Lest I Pretences make, With wicked Men to act a Part, And of their Feasts partake. 5Just Mens Reproof I'll bear, Like purest Oil 'twill flow, Which chears, not hurts my Head, and Pray'r I'll make for them in Woe. 6Their Chiefs shall ly o'erthrown In steep and stony Ways; Then shall the rest my Counsel own, My Words, as wholsome, praise. 7Our Bones dispers'd and broke About the Grave are found, Like Chips, that by the Feller's Stroke Ly scatter'd o'er the Ground. 8But, Lord, to Thee my Eyes I turn, on Thee I wait; Do not my needy Soul despise, Nor leave it desolate. 9Preserve me from the Snare, Which they have laid for me, And from the Gins, that they prepare, Who work Iniquity. 10O let them in the Net, Their own Device, be caught, While from the Toil, that they have set, In Safety I am brought. Another Metre. 1 O make great Haste, and, Lord, when I Implore thy Aid, give Ear, In Mercy listen to my Cry, And my Petition hear. 2Lord, let my earnest Pray'r to Thee, As fragrant Incense rise; And let my Hands uplifted be, As Ev'ning Sacrifice. 3Lord Gracious, let thy Watch before My Mouth with Care attend; And of my Lips keep thou The Door, That they may not offend. 4Bend not to any Ill my Heart, Lest I Pretences make, With wicked Men to act a Part, And of their Feasts partake. 5I, from the Just, Reproof will bear, Like purest Oyl 'twill flow, Which chears, not hurts my Head, and Pray'r I'll make for them in Woe. 6When their chief Men are overthrown In steep and stony Ways, Then shall the Rest my Counsel own, My Words, as wholsome, praise. 7Behold our Bones dispers'd and broke About the Grave are found, Like Chips, that by the Feller's Stroke Ly scatter'd o'er the Ground. 8But, Lord, to Thee, my eager Eyes I turn, on Thee I wait; Do not my needy Soul despise, Nor leave me desolate. 9Preseve me from the secret Snare, Which they have laid for me, And from the Gins, which they prepare, Who work Iniquity. 10O let them in th' entangling Net, Their own Device, be caught; While from the Toil that they have set In Safety I am brought. Psalm CXLII. 1 I to the Lord Cries earnest sent, And did my Pray'r address; 2I did my Meditation vent, And open'd my Distress. 3When sore my Spirit was dismay'd, My Path was known to Thee; In my frequented Ways they laid A secret Snare for me. 4Pleaders I sought on my Right Hand, But none for me appear'd; All Succour fail'd, no Friend to stand By me in Danger car'd. 5To God I earnest cry'd, and said, Thou, Lord, my Refuge art, My Portion, whence my Life is fed, 'Till I from hence depart. 6Lord, to my fervent Cry attend, Brought down in Dust I dwell; From my Oppressours me defend, Who me in Strength excell. 7From Caves, my Prisons, me release, To sing loud Praise to Thee; The Just shall compass me in Peace, When I Thy Bounty see. Psalm CXLIII. 1 Hear me, as Thou art Good and True, Lord, to my Pray'r reply; 2To Judgment bring me not, for who Is spotless in thine Eye? 3The Foes pursu'd, they down have smit My Life, and on me tread, And made me in dark Places sit Forgotten, as the Dead. 4My Spirit now o'erwhelm'd I find, My Heart is desolate; 5I search past Times, and call to Mind Thy Works of ancient Date. 6To Thee in Pray'r, Lord, Just and True, Behold I stretch my Hands; For Thee I thirst as heav'nly Dew, Is crav'd by Sun-burnt Lands. 7Make Speed; Jehovah, answer me, My failing Spirit save; Hide not Thy Face, lest I should be Like Dwellers in the Grave. 8Soon let me hear a kind Reply, For Thou my Refuge art; To me make known thy Way, for I To Thee lift up my Heart. 9Lord, from the threat'ning Enemy Grant me Deliv'rance sure; 10Thou art my Trust, to Thee I fly, With Thee to hide secure. Thou art my God, teach me thy Will, By thy good Spirit led, Let me on even Places, still Preserv'd from slipping, tread. 11Revive me Lord, in my Distress, That I Thy Name may praise; And to declare Thy Righteousness, My soul from Trouble raise. 12In Mercy, Lord, the Proud controul, Cut off my Enemies; Destroy them, who afflict my Soul, Lord, for thy Servant rise. Psalm CXLIV. 1 O Bless'd for ever be the Lord, My Help and saving Might, Who shews my Hand to weild the Sword, My Fingers how to fight. 2Thou art my God, most Good, my Fort, Deliv'rer, Trust, and Tow'r; By Thee inclin'd the Tribes support, And own my regal Pow'r. 3Lord, what is Man, that in thy Mind Thou should'st his Welfare bear? The Son of Man, that he should find He is Thy tender Care? 4Man is an unsubstantial Show, An empty Breath, a Fume, His Days appointed swiftly flow, And, Shadow-like, consume. 5Lord bow thy Heav'ns, come down in might, And with Thy Thunder's Stroke, The lofty Mountains touch, and smite The Hills, and they shall smoke. 6Cast forth by Thee let Light'nings fly, And drive them from their Place: Shoot thy bright Arrows from the Sky, And thus destroy their Race. 7Send from above thy pow'rful Hand, Me from great Waters save, From People of a foreign Land, Lord, I Deliv'rance crave. 8See, their unfaithful Mouths abound With boastful Words and vain, And their Right Hand, a Hand is found, That Fraud and Falshood stain. Part II. 9In a new Hymn to God, my King, My grateful Heart I'll vent: To aid my Song the Psalt'ry bring, And Ten-string'd Instrument. 10Not their own Arms to Princes yield Salvation, but the Lord, Who do's his Servant David shield, Against the threat'ning Sword. 11Deliver me from Strangers round, Lest they should Jacob spoil; Their Mouths with haughty Speech abound, And their right Hand with Guile: 12That, like green Plants, our Sons may wear In Youth a flow'ry Bloom, Our Daughters, as a Palace fair, May beauteous Forms assume. 13That our rich Magazines of Grain Abundant Stores may hold, And that our Flocks may on the Plain Bring forth Ten Thousand fold. 14That strong the Ox may grow for Toil, That there no Inrode be, Nor marching out against it, while Our Streets from Cries are free. 15Happy the People, who can say Their Case is such as this; In what a happy State are they, Whose God Jehovah is? Psalm CXLV. 1 Thee I'll exalt my God, O King, I'll ever bless thy Name; 2My daily Off'ring Praise I'll bring, And ever spread thy Fame. 3Great is the Lord most High, and hence Should greatly be ador'd, Nor of His pow'r the Depths immense Can finite Reason ford. 4Age shall to Age thy Works convey, And thy great Deeds recite; 5Thy glorious Honours I'll display, And tell thy Works of Might. 6Men on thy Wonders will converse; Thy Greatness I'll express, 7Much they thy Goodness will rehearse, And sing thy Righteousness. 8God is Compassionate, inclin'd To Love, and prone to spare; 9His Mercy never is confin'd, Which all his Creatures share. 10Lord, all thy Works give praise to Thee, Thy Saints shall bless thy Name; 11Thy Kingdom's glorious Majesty And Pow'r, they shall proclaim; 12To make to Men his Regal Pow'r, And mighty Actions known; 13Thy Reign for ever shall endure, No Time shall shake thy Throne. 14The Lord to upholds all them that fall, The Sorrowful revives; 15On God attend the Eyes of all, Who Food in Season gives. 16To ev'ry living Thing Supplies, Thy open Hand conveys; 17As gracious, all thy Works I prize, As righteous, all thy Ways. 18The Lord to help them still is nigh, Who send up Pray'r sincere; 19He'll hear and save them, when they cry, Who his great Name revere. 20He'll save the Just, but Sinners slay, 21Our God I will adore; And gladly let all Flesh display, His Praise for evermore. Psalm CXLVI. 1 Praise ye the Lord, extol the King, My Soul, while Life remains; 2I'll bless my God, his Praises sing, While He this Frame sustains. 3Do not on mighty Kings depend, Nor trust to Adam's Seed, For they can no Assistance lend, In Times of greatest Need. 4Soon as he gasps his Breath away, He turns again to Dust; And all his Thoughts that very Day, And Purposes are lost. 5Blest Man, whom Jacob's God do's aid, Whose Hope is in the Lord; 6Who Heav'n and Earth, and all Things made, And ever keeps his Word. 7He Righteous Judgment executes, For all, who are opprest; With Food, the Hung'ry He recruits, And gives the Pris'ner Rest. 8The Lord gives to the Blind their Sight, And Men bow'd down do's raise; He loves them, who have Hearts upright, And walk in blameless Ways. 9The Lord preserves the Stranger, He To Orphans Mercy shows, Relieves the Widow's Poverty, But wicked Ways o'erthrows. 10The Lord to endless Days shall reign, In Zion God ador'd; Unmov'd his Kingdom shall remain, For ever praise the Lord. Psalm CXLVII. 1 Praise ye the Lord, sweet is the Theme, And Praises you become; 2The Lord rebuilds Jerusalem, And brings her Out-casts Home. 3He heals the Heart, that's broke with Woes, Binds up their Wounds with Care: 4The Number of the Stars he knows, And can their Names declare. 5Great is our Lord, his Pow'r is vast, His Knowledge has no Bound: 6His Hands exalt the Meek, but cast The Wicked to the Ground. 7Ye People with Thanksgiving sing Loud Praises to the Lord, On the sweet Harp to God, our King, Sing Praise with one accord. 8He do's the Regions of the Air With Clouds and Vapours fill, Do's Show'rs for thirsty Lands prepare, Which cloath with Grass the Hill. 9He for the Beast finds Food to eat, And when young Ravens cry, With Hunger pinch'd, to Heav'n for Meat, His Stores their Wants supply. Part II. 10He takes no Pleasure in the Might, And Courage of the Horse, Nor finds in Humane Limbs Delight, For Beauty prais'd or Force. 11The Lord Delight and Pleasure takes In him, who fears his Name; Who his experienc'd Mercy makes, His Hope, and constant Aim. 12O praise the Lord, Jerusalem, Thy God, O Zion, praise, 13He barr'd thy Gates, and strengthen'd them, And blest thy Children's Ways. 14He gives thy Borders Peace, and thee With finest Wheat supplies; 15On Earth He sends forth his Decree, His Order swiftly flies. 16Like Wool, he scatters fleecy Snows, Like Ashes, frosty Mist, 17Hail-stones of Ice He downward throws, Who can his Cold resist? 18He sends Abroad his high Commands, And bids warm Breezes blow, Which soon unbind the stiffen'd Lands, And make the Waters flow. 19To Jacob only he reveals His Statutes and his Word; 20While from the Nations He conceals His Judgments. Praise the Lord. Psalm CXLVIII. 1 To praise th' Almighty, ye, that dwell In heav'nly Heights, your Voices raise; 2Ye Hosts of Angels, who excell In Hallelujahs, sing his Praise. 3His Praise ye Sun and Moon repeat, And glitt'ring Stars, that nightly rise; 4Praise Him, O Heav'n of Heav'ns, his Seat, And Clouds above the lower Skies. 5Praise Him for you did by the Force Of his Command begin to Be; 6He fix'd your everlasting Course, By his unchangeable Decree. 7Ye various Creatures, that abound Thro' the whole Earth, Jehovah praise: Ye mighty Whales and Gulphs profound, Your roaring Voice to laud Him raise. 8Ye airy Meteors, Snow and Fire, Hailstones and Vapours, cold and warm, Winds, that to raise the Storm conspire, And always his Commands perform. 9Mountains and Hills, each Tree that brings Forth Fruit, all Cedars fam'd for Height; 10All Cattel, Beasts, and creeping Things And Fowls, that wing in Air your Flight. 11Subjects and Princes, Lords of Pow'r, And Judges, whom the Nations dread; 12Striplings and Maidens in the Flow'r Of Youth, the Babe and hoary Head: 13By you let Praise to God be giv'n, Whose Name alone is Excellent, His Glory far out reaches Heav'n, And Earth in measureless Extent. 14High, He his People's Horn has rais'd, Whence by his Saints He is ador'd, And by the Sons of Jacob prais'd, His favour'd House. Praise ye the Lord Another Metre. 1 Praise ye the Lord, that dwell In Heav'n, th' Almighty praise; Your Voices, who excell In Strength, to bless Him raise. 2Ye Angels, who In glorious Hosts, Guard Heav'ns bright Coasts, Give Praises due. 3Praise Him, ye Moon and Sun, To whom you owe your Light; Praise Him ye Stars, that run Your Course to grace the Night. 4Ye Heav'ns, his Seat, Extol his Name, Ye Clouds, his Fame, And praise repeat. 5For you, by his Command, First into Being rose, And from his pow'rful Hand Your Conservation flows. 6His high Decree, That by its Force Has fix'd your Course, No Change shall see. 7Praise, all on Earth, the Lord, Ye Dragons from your Caves, And Gulphs, that none can ford, Praise Him with all your Waves. 8Mists from moist Lands, Fire, Hail, and Snow, And Winds that blow As He commands. 9Mountains, that tow'ring rise, Trees that with Fruit abound, Cedars, that midst the Skies, Display your Heads renown'd. 10Beasts, wild and tame, Each creeping Thing, And Birds of Wing, His Praise proclaim. 11Kings, who o'er Nations reign, And People, who obey, Judges, who Laws ordain, Or Courts of Justice sway: 12Youth strong and hail, And Maidens gay, Bald Heads or grey, And Infants frail. 13O to the Lord's high Throne By these be Praises sent, For, know, his Name alone Is great and excellent. Out reaching Space, His Glories rise Above the Skies, And Earth's wide Face. 14Since God to us has born Good-will from early Days, And rais'd his People's Horn, Of all his Saints the Praise. Ye Jacob's Line, A People near, And to him dear, To praise him join. Psalm CXLIX. 1 New Songs of Praise for Mercies new, Mid'st Saints assembled sing, 2Joy in thy Maker, Israel, shew, And, Zion, in thy King. 3Extol the Lord, ye sacred Quire, With Pipes sound forth his Praise, On the sweet Timbrel, and the Lyre, To Heav'n his Glory raise. 4The Lord do's Pleasure and Delight In his own People take, The Humble, by his saving Might, He do's Illustrious make. 5Let all thy Saints, O Lord our King, In Glory gain'd rejoyce, And on their Beds aloud to sing Let them exalt their Voice. 6Be in their Mouths high Praise, a Sword Two-edg'd be in their Hands, 7That Wrath on Heathens may be pour'd, And Vengeance on the Lands. 8That they may bind their Kings and Lords, With the led Captive's Chain, In Iron Links, and servile Cords, Their Potentates restrain. 9These with the Judgments to pursue, Which sacred Books record, Is to the Saints the Honour due; Ye People, praise the Lord. As the CXIII??. 1 Praise ye and glorify the Lord, Let him for ever be ador'd; And mid'st the Saints assembled sing, New Songs of Praise, for Mercies new; 2Joy in thy Maker, Israel, shew, And, Zion, triumph in thy King. 3Extol the Lord, ye sacred Quire, On the sweet Timbrel and the Lyre, And with soft Pipes sound forth his Praise; 4God in his People takes Delight, He'll rescue by his saving Might The Meek, and them to Honour raise. 5Triumph ye Saints, with cheerful Voice, With Shouts for Glory won rejoyce, And on your Beds express your Joy; 6Be in your Mouths Hymns to the Lord, And in your Hands a Two-edg'd Sword, 7Your Foes, the Heathen to destroy. 8To bind their Potentates with Chains, In Iron Links their noble Trains, And pour on Aliens Wrath decreed; 9The Saints shall this great Honour have To quell their Foes, and Zion save. Praise ye the Lord, O Jacob's Seed. Psalm CL. 1 Let Praises to the Lord be sent, For his pure Holiness; O Praise him for the Firmament, Which do's his Pow'r express. 2In Songs his mighty Deeds proclaim, Praise to his Greatness suit, 3With Sound of Trumpet praise his Name, With Psaltry, Harp, and Flute. 4The Timbrel take, on Praise intent, Sound with the Pipe his Praise; The Organ, and string'd Instrument Jehovah's Name should raise. 5Loud Cymbals in his Praise employ, Cymbals of lofty Sound; 6Praise him all ye that Breath enjoy, Let God with Praise be crown'd.
