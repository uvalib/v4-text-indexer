      <field name="fulltext">THE BOOK OF THE HOLY GRAAL I The Quest of a Perfect Sleep Seekers of very life, who urge the quest, God save and keep you through the waking ways: Hear ye the quest in dream. The soul is call'd In every path and can advance in each. God compasses His ends in ways of sleep, As on death's road, and while from day to day Light into dark dissolves, while night in turn Dies and is glorified in golden dawn, With no line drawn between, no mood of haste Or violence: so softly, unawaresâ After the wont of blessingsâthe sleep-state And waking fuse together and transform. Each unto each has ministry: the soul Is led through both, and those who keep the questâ Set round in all the spaces of the heart With fires of eager longingâmay in sleep Press on to reach the vision and attain The Sacred Goal. . . . Can dreams begun therein Their true translation find in waking terms? Where else but in high dream does quest beginâ Asleep and waking? Or when pass therefrom But in the quickening and the eyes' keen light Of compass'd end? I look, my God, for Thee On both sides of the world of life, and Thou Hast peopled both with auspices, hast flung Paths open. I have found Thy sacramentsâ A daily nourishmentâin each. Reverse All normal orders, Thou forestalling Will: One quest is ours; the ardent heart is one. What care or choice is mine when all is Thou? Nay, unto man I testify and Thee That any phantom change which man calls death Shall not one moment's space bewray the feet Which hasten towards Thee. I have known one need Since first we came togetherâThou and Iâ With that concurrent flash of certitude That each was meant for each. The want is Thou. Need me still, Master, on Thy part as God! And slumber, waking life, concordant death, Divided veilsâshowing another sun Upon the soulâanother mode of search, Of questioning the darkness and the light Until they give Thee upânot these, nor aught Shall still or satisfy, or turn aside: I challenge all in Thee, for Theeâthe All. Hear then the Quest in dream, and mark it well: Sleep has its sacraments, and God pours through. BEATA MEA through the world of dream Went up and down in wistful ways of sleep, And bore the great Pyx or Ciborium, With meek hands lifted as in sacrifice, Head as in worship bent. A crowd at times She fed, with blessed fingers lifting up Host after Host, pure lips from time to time Blessing as well. Now some received, their heartsâ Like kneesâinclined; some also bless'd; and some Pray'd, in the presence of a mystery. Some stood with heads erect, aspiring eyes, Uplifted hands, as into rapture drawn, Nor knew they well the giver or the gift, By contemplation hush'd. But other some, Heart-thankless, wrought with hunger, took and cursed. Some cried, upbraiding; a few turn'd and rent Their garments, passing into paths aside. But whether dole or joy, the end was one: From rapture, recollection or disdain They rose, each man and woman going forth Soul starvedâO sorrowful, ungracious task, BEATA MEA, faring farâalone And wearifulâby wistful ways of sleep. So moved the normal ministry. But great And singular were interposed events Which raised it rarely from those faded grooves About the spurs of which grey characters Spelt failure. Issues into other paths Brought other service, now of dying men, Stricken by hedges, under trees, in wastes Of perilous rocks. A scowling sun perchance Through tempest glared, or an attenuate moon Whiten'd the mournful spaces. In such hours, Such places, raising the maim'd presences On her own knees, she gave of that she bare, Helping the perishing through to further bourne, Restoring seldom or to life of earth In dream-life leading back. So also glades Gave up thatch'd cottages, sequester'd huts, Where bread was life to mother or to maid And child in arms. A nimbus moved about BEATA'S head in ministry like thisâ And hers an angel's visits. The white Bread Fail'd not within the Pyx; but whence it came She wot not; how such mournful service fell Upon her, or the meaning and the endâ These things were veil'd. Beginning there was none, Through all her life of dreamânothing but this: The immemorial spaces of sleep's mind Held nought beside; and well, it seem'd, might one Who found no vestige in the furthest past Of starting forth come never unto termâ God's pilgrim ever, through an age before, An endless age behind. Did God impose Indeed? A certain vestige of His will Seem'd in the tying of that inward yoke, Which thus constrain'd, and would have made it light Had ever dawn of purpose lifted up Close-brooding clouds of doubt. Her heart therein Wearied, if not perchance the psychic limbs. She pass'd a shadow, dream by dream inwoven, A presence of beauty, sadness in the soul Chief immanence within, fell want without, For all the nations in that shadow'd world Were starved about her. Darkly shrouded end, Not less perchance all brightness, shall your sun, Beyond the vision, soaring upward, still Long questioning with perfect answer? How Interpret else that feelingâformless, vagueâ Which dwelt within the pilgrim, parted far From any stage of certitude, and yet Suggesting not alone a term of quest But meaning in the whole to compass path And origin? Would this be found in dream Or waking? Question for the heart which reads BEATA'S story, yet beyond her own Measures of sleep, unknown as dream by her. Though otherwhere a diverse part of life Was surely hers, its images were dim: While shapes of sleep upon the waking state Broke in, this otherâfor the conscious soulâ Sank deeper down. Now, while her world of dream BEATA travels, a phantom bearing bread, God keep the paths of action and God lead Through paths of vision to a goal of peace. I see Thy morning brighten; Its floods of splendour spread: O gold beyond the purple And green above the red. All locks and gates flung backward, Behind the radiant tide Thy towers and courts are looming, The entrance ways look wide. When words well'd up within me, As one to witness bidden, My voice declared Thy presenceâ Within the cosmos hidden. Now in the godly coming Of this most gracious day, Thy rumours throng the threshold And not the far away. In the blessed now and here Do I behold Thee near; And if my earthly seeing Still veils Thy holy being, Till other eyes are given, Of Thee in golden heaven, When heart of light is open And paths to Thee spread wide, Will I bear faithful witness As now at morning-tide. II Dream-Nomads And quÃ¦stor dei, Brother of our hearts, To whom we also wish the end in God, A second pilgrim in the world of dreamâ Though each to each unknownâbore Wine therein, And up and down the wistful ways of sleep A Blessed Chalice in his hands held up, Through sleepways dark and lightâmost sacred gift, He knew not whence, high sign put forth in sleep, He knew not why. The fabled alkahest Might so be pour'd, as from another world On thisâhigh spirit, potent to renew: Yet craving was not still'd. As she with Bread, Heâdarkly mission'dâminister'd in Wine To multitudes who drank and were athirst. She was not quench'd who fed the rest, while he Went famish'd who bore Wine about the world, And both knew grief, though less for want of theirs Than service impotent in normal need To cruel dearth of many. There were times When all his office, all events therein Seem'd moving through a world of images, Of painted signs which signified in vain For lack of life within him. Could he reach The hidden meaning, life imparted then Might make in very truth the wine he bore A saving gift. In grace of other hoursâ Rare visitants, as if from far awayâ He felt that something waited to declare Itself, the term exhibit and perchance Put end to pilgrim life, from other souls Apart. Two nomads of a realm wherein They moved like living symbols, their dream-world Itself a show which shows, divided each From each, observe among the things they shared In common, one enduring miracle: The Bread and Wine between them borne and served Were never wanting. Some unstinted spring Renew'd the red juice of the mystic grape In holy Chalice, as in holy Pyx Was Bread renew'd. Most surely from one source Of hidden power or grace in the unseen Both came. Now, what shall follow if they be Foremeant to meet at one or other pointâ The man and maid? When Wine and Bread shall mix, Will those who want in any place of dream Be fill'd and satisfied? Will clouded term Strip off its shadows and will eager eyes Be lighted up with Knowledge? Keep them, Lord, Of secret ways and open. Stand about The pilgrim-hearts who do Thy strange behests, Till now uncertain that they come from Thee, But yet with something of good will, towards Thine Directed. Present in Thy Wine and Bread Be Thou, the immanence in all, the life And meaning. Lo, Thy sacraments abide In all our paths and grace through them flows in; Meet for the measures of our daily needs, Our powers of true perception. Most of all We have tried and proved Thy sacro-saintly food, And unto some a saving door to Thee Has open'd there. Beyond these ministries Of Thine, all doors beyond, we look for Thee. In waking life we hold within our hearts Thy dream, and after Thee we strive in sleep: Through dreams and waking aid, to reach our goal. Till I can bless with fingers touch'd by Thee, Bless Thou my Bread, And bless the Wine by which I look to be Through Thine all-ministering bounty fed. In all my ways through earthly days May food of earth become the food of soul And food of souls sustain this earthly frame: So under one control Of sacramental law shall earth and heaven Become the same. For both one food is given, And in Thy Name For these Thy gifts I praise Thee. But if this I can and dare, Thy gifts are less than Thou: Send down Thy saving grace. Make sacred now These hands, O Heart of Hallows, nor alone For self in blessing; but that Food which is My life of soul to others let me give, That they may also live. Thy valid consecrations by my own Be in the shadow-types of words foreshown; And Thou who art the Giver and the Gift, To those who hearts uplift, Be Thou made known. III A Daughter of Life Beata mea, in the world of men Was Eva, shorten'd from Evangeline, As if she bore unspell'dâin hidden lifeâ Some gospel-message, on a day beyond, Predestined to awaken in the heart And well to lips. The maid meanwhile was fair: Her beauty brought good tidings to a few. What else I know not, in the morn of youth, She gave, except an inward shining sense And virtue of her clean simplicity. A little, none too plainly, set apart By orchid-whiteness of her womanhood Or one great longingâof the soul to learn And the soul's endâshe went about her ways, The tasks allotted in her father's house. Still ways, light tasks, made little call at best On sources seal'd, capacities within, To whose own hidden wants that house held none For ministryâno mother to discern The roots of need. Her fatherâkind in heart Of meaningâdwelt absorb'd, a learned man, Maker of learned books and known to fame. By indecisive movements, passing through His ring-fenced province of material mind, He felt her famine, but the soul was dream And the soul's hope for him. Of that and this He spoke, as one who takes within his thought A bare, remote hypothesis and turns One fact about another, to survey With reason's eye. Detach'd, no light he found, No life of true concern to that domain He brought, but wish'd the daughter whom he prized In his abstracted way might find ere long Something of life's realities, perhaps In wedlock, motherhood, the natural cares Which cast out vague imaginings. What help Here for a hungry heart, no stir in his Towards ghostly aims? Distresses and regrets, Love even, for his one and lonely girlâ If duly weigh'dâwere of a kindly heart, A little puzzled, and far down amused A little, but live heartâthe letter'd man Had none to prompt within him. It was well And pleasant when in too brief hours of ease She sat, low-stool'd, beside him, shaded light Casting its lustre, gold among the red Of the rich auburn hair; while glowing hearth Flush'd the fair face with more than normal warmth Of changing colour. And though no strict sense Of definite possession, outside his rangeâ Second to noneâof keen, unfruitful thought, Kept him in actual touch with things without, There was a mode, quite tacitly implied, Wherein the notion of her daughterhood, Of him as father, interlinking both, Was counted good, however unexpress'd. So with this slight, yet serviceable bond They dwelt together and no burden knew Therein. The void beneath it and the sad Awareness that she look'd for help in vain To him, so quietly assumed by her, So held as granted, theseâin mildness keptâ Took on no deep complexion of distress. Indeed the want and waiting were themselves As much her natural, foregranted state As that strange mission in the place of dream, Accounted always in the waking ways A something sacred, haunted and remote, Not to be shared with any. The clouded termâ By which suspended purpose left the heart Emptied thereinâgave answer from afar To the world-ways of her, for us who see That twofold state of life, but not for her, Or scarcely. There was lonely doom in both, An arrestation and a formless blank, The task of doing and of going on, Truly a task imposed she knew not why. Poor patience proved in each her main support: And expectation also, whether more In sleep or waking she could hardly tell, Nor I convey. That something, near or far, Upheld a torch of knowledge in the path She felt, and so kept on. All these things shaped Her moods and harbour'd certitudeâin both Her inward statesâof being kept apart. Reflected ever in the waking ways, That undetermined mission of her dreams Shut off, she knowing there was none like her In all her circle. She had talk'd of sleep, Its mystery, of things that came therein, And with a certain sacred subtlety Had sought in others for a whisper'd hint Of kindred happenings, of work and quest, But follow'd vainly. There were dreamers round About her, but of strange continuance In vision, meaningful or dark like her, None; and the baffled essay, coupled too With disconcerting questions in return On why and what, her own experienceâ If anyâstifled an experiment Which jeopardized the secret still her own And not another's, to be shared at will. So as in all things else, herein she took The waiting counsel, spelling to herself Patience. The word was written in her heart: Patience, not only for the end of quest, For hidden purpose shaping things within, For higher knowledge in the normal mind, But more for that which wore no certain form, Though all bespoke its presenceâneed of love. So 'twixt desire of light and that profound Necessity of nature which engulfs Our beingâin possession and absence bothâ She stood suspended. Now the viewless term Shaped itself vaguely as of Things Divine Encompass'd, now as love uplifting life And glorifying outward things, in truth A shining towards her from the shrouded end. But since self-knowledge, not indeed explored, Though vistas open'd, shew'd her human love Asleep within her, stirring in the sleep And moaning, as if this also dream'd and wept Frustrated, these twin aspects of the one Great good, which is all life and earth and heaven, Work'd in and out and round upon themselves, Untilâreversed in dealings of the mindâ She seem'd to seek the one as if in terms And symbols of the other, yet attain'd Neither, so close and yet so far was man, Though yearn'd for only in the sense of God Encompassing, indwelling, while how past All seeing, utterly remote of all Was all of God. There is but one thing more To close these plain memorials of a maid In outward ways, before her change began. The Churches drew her and the Mass therein; But records in the hand have fail'd to show When and how often, if indeed at allâ Except in spiritâshe received the Food Of Souls at earthly Altars. It is known That something mostly hinder'dâas in dream She who fed others never broke the bread She bore in Pyx, because her office served Not to herself but others. Here on earth, I think, her unfill'd multitudes of sleep Spelt a regarded lesson, or some fear Restrain'd her, lest the indrawn thought of Christâ The Mysticalâshould suffer from a rite Perform'd with partial knowledge, the Bread here Want life beyond the element and Wine Reserve the spirit in its shining veil, A cover'd mystery. But she made at will, And often, spiritual communions, cast In spiritâworshippingâon altar steps, While kneeling bodily in nave or aisle, Or reservation chapels seal'd with peace And still'd with sanctity. From far awayâ Distance and greatest distanceâto the soul That long'dâshe almost saw the end of quest And almost tasted spiritual food Of sweetness, while the palpitating chant Of great invoking litanies inwrapt Her psychic nature. So at times she lost The lame unmeaningness of days and dreams, And on the threshold of a living land Paused love-inspired. O Bona Domini, Terra viventium. Then the waste itself Of ill-spell'd dreams and days changed over, took The grade of life, uplifted in the Breath Of Life and SpiritâTerra Exilii, Yet also Bona Domini. So much The blessed spirit of the quest on earth, Uplifted to the holy path of heaven, Gives me to certify of thy life-steps, BEATA MEA. A little while, a little while, Thou hast placed meâa pilgrim hereâ But at first I knew not why, Because of the heart's idolatry, Its making of idols, its worshipping. And yet in the hush of the heart I heard, Low breathed for ever, one secret word. A little while, a little whileâ Is it long from cloud to clear?â Then out of the dark and its deeps indrawn A glimmer, a gleam and a golden dawn High promise of beauty bring. From idols fallen and altar broken I turn'd because of Thy secret token. A little while, a little while, Thou wilt gather me hence and steer Through ways more open, through ways more fair, Ways that are Thine in the otherwhere, When the soul its flight shall wing. But that which is secret, that which is mine, In the heart of the soul carry I. It is Thine, it is mine; It is mine because it is Thine: O mystery, meaning and reason why. IV A Way in the Waking World And the man whose partâ Unmark'd by eachâmade answer to her own Thus closely in a common mystery: What of his outer ways? He kept, I know, Some glimpse of dream-beginnings, or at least His soul-state pass'd into the waking life, A sudden dawn of knowledge, on a day Remember'd well. Behind it spread the time When conscious life no beacon cast thereon. But that which fix'd the sovereign fact in mind Mark'd not an origin in pregnant dream: As yesterday therein led on to-day And spoke of morrows, so the past might be Drawn out unbroken. Leaving clear in thought No hint of limitation at one end Or other, possibly pre-natal states Held that same theme, and life past earth perchance No other: so did his experience Repeat BEATA'S. But this blank of blanks Reacted ever in the outward ways Diversely on an eager, restless heart, Quick with desire, as sudden in resolve, All ready to rebel but not to waitâ Saving the soul in patience. Hence his name Of QUÃSTOR DEI, for his life in verse As fitting symbol chosen. Not to hide That which counts nothing, poor identity On earth, it reaches over to express A sacramental nature, up and down Strange ways of thought and effort urging fast And moiling. There turn'd back, it broke up here Whatever barr'd; or at an alley's end Finding no better than a wall's sheer heightâ Past scalingâyet unconquer'd, once again It veer'd and so restarted. Labour wins Result at last; the crown descends thereto, And high desireâupleaping and aflameâ Soars to attain it. Now, the sleepless heart Of QUÃSTOR DEI toil'd after truth and God. Resolve was ever towards the end; misease At let and hindrance was the chafe at self And its preventing chain. Rebellion too Withstood no idle postulate of doom Or God's opposing will, but failing worth To follow on a call so high, but weak And errant nature, all within the man Which miss'd the goal conceived. These, in his thoughts, Kept back, these made the warfare of his world Faint-hearted tactics, he so prone to yield, Call truce, so tempted towards a shameful peace. Perchance misdoubt and such reproach made up The bar erected. In his heart he knew The quest was follow'd, being part of growth, And to forestall was foolish in the hope, Nor came to aught, save new impediment. So also moods befell, when unawares The contest ceased: a little while the soul Reposed as on the open hand of God, Resign'd and temper'd. Then the strange dreamlife Display'd its miracle of guidance; then Expectant mind foresaw what lay beyondâ Not in clear vision, yet from doubt set freeâ As some fair end in knowledge and in light. Then also QUÃSTOR DEI felt and knew What place apart he held. He did not need To sift acquaintance, so to stand assured That no man slept himself into a world Like his. That it must take him in good time To some unwitted termâhere faith came in; The high sincerity and truth of God Involved this and assured. But more than all He knew dream-life into the waking life Had brought salvation, brought the note of quest, Made known that something somewhere in the world Was waiting, not beyond a strenuous search And not so much desirable or fair As very need, meaning and life of being. For the rest, QUÃSTOR DEI stood unyoked, Without possessions or prosperity, Without adversity, or pinch of want, In a middle and moderate way, some daily bread Earn'd, nor too hardlyâhow shall matter not. Poet he was by virtue of the gift, Not quite unheeded. A young, earnest man And student, clean of thought and in his life Clean, he resolved on God and his own soul's Unfoldment, rather as a work in God Than as demanding guerdon, not in fear Of loss, yet anxious lest he miss the term And go in darkness who should walk in light. His past knew other searchings, but the dream Had saved him, dawning into consciousness; Had once conceived unutterable loss And found it dwell within him. In his verse He pictured one who took such loss to heart As pre-elected to its nameless chargeâ For the whole world's salvation. When this theme Grew first within him, when from more to more He shaped it, zealous and absorb'd therein, The thing possess'd him, the thing lived in himâ Subject and self inwoven and inbound. The more he dwelt upon that darksome tale, Touch'd and retouch'd the record, not to gild, Not to adorn with picture-light of words, But there and here to give the guise of truth And very seeming, the more it work'd in him, On him laid hold. A sickness of the mind Came over him: the imaged life became His own. In stresses of a final draft, A last sad conquest in reality, It seem'd that something which was more than self Empower'd him to accept the part of doom. That which his mind had fashion'd and evolved Cross'd the dim threshold between art and life, Lodged after as a madness in the brain, And haunted. Exorcizing power of will Was baffled. Panic follow'd, then the time Of a still frenzy, as he took the dread Into his heart and nursed it, help'd the growth Within, consented and was crucified. The grand climacteric of a single night Wrote itselfâa red fireâin heart and head. He rent the poem and its fragments knew Another flame. His witness was himself, All else flash'd back false seeming, having cast Self beyond hope apart. To satisfy Such woe with record were some weak attempt To comfort that which neither man nor God Would rest henceforth. But then, another mood: So great a tragedy of all the worlds Might well be burnt into a few brief lines, That man at least might know. And so he wrote, As one whose stylus in the darkness halts, Whose hand shakes, shaping an uncertain word, Or misspells half his message in the night: Night all, both word and thought, most dreadful night; And in the soul that dark on which no dawn Was look'd to break, world without end prolong'd. I know that life is Thine and life is Thou, That life is life, O Lord, for evermore: Thou the beginning and Thou the end and Thou The after and beforeâ That which abides betwixt the here and now, And there and then. But death is that which stands from Thee apart In empty nothingness eternally; For Thou art all. Amen. A Life in life, where'er I move Thou art, And growth is mine in Thee from more to more: Shall aught of soul to naught of death respond? I am alive in Thee and cannot die, But pass from star to star, from shore to shore, In vast of this world and more vast beyond, Imploring knowledge of my soul in Thee, Its deeps to penetrate, its heights endow: Knowledge of Thee in me, Till Thine in Thee is Thou. V A Tale of Eternal Death âThe saviour of the unborn worlds to comeââ So shaped his story of eternal deathâ âRenouncing type and parable, speaks once And there is henceforth no more prophecy. âI pledged myself to seek diviner life, Flinging the past behind; with stedfast face, Look'd forth on truth; and one of all the world Dared all the heights. Not so the mission came. Heights fail'd: upstanding as on peaks of thought, Meseem'd the mazes of the mind enwound Still, and beyond them was unpeopled voidâ God hidden in the spaces 'twixt the stars And more in solar glory deeply veil'd. But thought, the darkest curtain, hung between Heart and essential being. Self likewise Barr'd self from knowledge, open'd gulfs between Man and that great unmanifest Divine Deep-seal'd within him. Paralysed I fell To night and nothing. In my darkness thenâ Helpless and humbledâthe dread mission came. It gave me darkness for my place, and hope My broken lampâall purpose miss'd but one. As Christ flung back Heaven's gates to all who came Believing and embracing, so could I Shut up the gates of hell by passing through And there abiding, through a work of will, Not slave's compulsion. Mine free choice of heart, And choice alone could make the mission mine. I testify as one who knelt and pray'd, In blacker garden than Gethsemane, For cup more bitter than was drunk of old By Mount of Olives to be taken hence. That cup still offer'd unto shrinking lips, Nor was mine angel mission'd to console. In fine I drank it to the dregs, all pain, All wrath accepting in the inmost self, That I might bring thee, World, from doom and woe. Body and soul into the gulf I cast, And fill it: now thou canst not fall therein. Hell's House is shut against thee by these hands, While from the dolorous place, all hope beyond, I peer between the bars, and thee so fair, Redeem'd unwittingly, my World, I see. Account it thou the chiefest test of love That though no Word Divine has come to mark Such sacrifice as ratified aboveâ The mission only from the mind itself Unfolded, self-conceived, self-built and last Self-takenâI hold God's silence like a word Of doom-encompassing consent; and that Accorded, utter dereliction now Descends and certifies the offering. I cry notâwoe is meâwith God's strong Son That âWhy hast Thou forsaken me?ââwhich seal'd His mission and reveal'd Divinity. My passion and the long-drawn life thereof Seems more than Golgotha or Calvary, For consciousness of Godhead unobscured Supported Him; but I am man alone: Nor special strength has nerved, nor man has dream'd, Nor Nature known. âHere in this testament The inspiration which inform'd me once At length bereaves me. Now my voice has lost Its early ring; the lightness from this pen Has vanish'd: there is lead in every line. Without conviction in the weight it drags, By every word I wrong the cause I own, And my poor life which, from this garrulous state Apart, might take some touch of the sublimeâ Because it was so secret and so stillâ Counts itself out in folly at the end. âYet must I speak: so only man shall know That one unaided, voluntary act Has taken to my heart the whole world's shame, Even the unrepented yoke thereof, For evermore. Who deems I err herein? Nay, God in fine is mercy and would send Some envoy surely of his hierarch-host To turn my path, if I deceived myselfâ To scourge me, were I blinded with my pride. The unassisted agony wherein This soul must keep shall over quickly quench All shining spectacles of sacrifice; Yet should I madden past the second deathâ Worldâcould I save thee not. And Thou, O Lord, Make this self-ruin grateful in Thy sight, But do not let one wrathful shaft of flame, From Thine eyes scorch, but for a moment's space, One fibre of man's being. âMan, forgive This unskill'd harping on the creaking strings Of my worn thought. Behold, I pass through life Anonymous, unknown, who might have seal'd Such mission with a gorgeous ministry, Sending apostles and disciples forth Through all the world, to conquer every heart, To bid them cease from evil and so make My stripes perchance the fewer. Through pleasant paths Of rose-leaf creed, for all in truth but one, Hereafter, haply I had led the earth To temple me, so taking full delight Of pomp and splendour from the peak of doom, Self-poised o'er all in god-pre-eminence. I might have met Diana the divineâ High loveâupon a golden night of nightsâ Yea, on some marriage-night of main and skyâ And in a silent, passion-haunted place, On which the stars shed influence benign, Where stars and moon concur, have known her grand And holy secret. So for this, for all Foregone, acquit me when my weakness calls On distant pulse of love from those I love To travel towards me through the sable voids. Trust me, in fine, to hold thee freed. Spare all Thou canst of all that hurts me. On my part I do repent me not. With heart aflame, Here I renew, a meek but stedfast man, My godly sacrifice. âRefulgent light Bared in the stormy Westâfire-fill'd abyssâ A conscious life assume and hear my pledge.â So broke the testament, reaching a kind of close In frenzy. Ave, Poet. He became His own dread epic; lived it out in heart; Took back, accepted; and again took back. So crazing more and more, he spilt himself Towards death or madness, then was sick to death, But at the end, by mercy, fell in strange, Far-haunted sleep. The mission-life of dream Broke there upon him, an old tale maybe, Long since rehearsed; but coming back with him For the first time into his waking world, That other dream which long distracted life Led forth its darksome pageant and went down Below the mind's horizon. So it was With QUÃSTOR DEI, bearing Cup of Dream, When something flowing over life of earth Brought on salvation. I awoke in Thy sunlight, I lived in Thy light: Very good, very sweet has it been, For all I have heard and seen Has been songs and visions of Thee. In the golden haze or the noon-white blaze And the violet height of the brooding night Were imagesâall of Thee. I have found Thee, Master of life and Lord: In all true voices Thy voice alone, And written on star and stone Thy sigils of act and word. May I, who awaken'd to hear and see The sounds so bless'd and the sights of Thee, Pass off at length into states more deep, The finding and keeping of perfect sleep, And awaken after in Thee. VI The House of Many Mansions A house of Many Mansions, lifted up, Arch over arch, wall above wall, with towers And spires, its portals soaring towards the skyâ An unimaginable vastnessâfill'd The open space, wherein the woodland path Ceased suddenly. A mist was on the wold Woven about BEATA, gazing still'd. A blotted moon, distended in the mist, Sifted the pallid vapours and infused A swooning light. The stedfast ways of sleep Had brought her up all suddenly, unwarn'd, Against that admirable pile. Between The parted hedge she look'd, as one transfix'd, Across the saturated mead's great stretch And at that mighty vision straight in front, Keeping the whole horizon. So might one Stand startled, stricken, unaccountable, To some strange star all suddenly transferr'd. It was a very silent placeâAmenâ In a silent world. Whatever breeze or wind Lived, in the breathing hush'd, had fallen low And, if it moved, stirr'd stilly wavering. Whatever life abode in leaf or blade Was being suspended. In BEATA died Heart and heart's rhythm. A cold fear at first Slipp'd through her veins of being. But this pass'd In wonder, reaching out from its own state To that of worship. Hence as one in prayer Clasps hands, to interlock the sense of God, She raised her Pyx to grasp the sense of height. And round about that unchased silver vase The moonlight fell and whiten'd. So stood she, By grades grown conscious in the secret soul Thatâlong days over, the rogation weeks Pastâher uncertain and uncounted months, Telling off years, had attain'd at length Their whole duration's culminating point, Till now there loom'd a threshold of the end, And there should presently be no more veils But high, intelligible purpose, glass'd In the great term attain'd. A patient ghost Among ghost-dwellers, from a land of ghost Emerging, all that lay behind her stepsâ Of places and durationsâseem'd about To take on vestures of reality, While she towards something vibrant in the heights And deeps of being, to the truth and life Of things moved surely. Nowâno longer ghost Or body of fleshly life, but soul awakeâ Or swiftly passing towards the waking stateâ She with uplifted arms and bended head, Crossing the meadow spaces, paused again, Those roofs and towers above her. That which cameâ Here in the closer presence of the Houseâ Was neither sense of peace welling within Nor sense-possessing majesty of span From base to summit, but the measureless, The abounding possibility of all In and outside relation to herself. Of how the great end should its scope affirm, Or where she was, no intimation came, Nor conscious need thereof. Unguerdon'd toil, Lone ways, unprofitable moods of thought Were overâthis, for ever. Was she meant To cross those precincts? Was it holy ground Within? Such questions did not leave her mind Uncertain. Would the mighty doors move back Unbidden, to admit her, or she waitâ A silent, watchful postulantâthrough days Or moons her summons? Nay, in a good hour She came, and this was the appointed place. That which had brought her to a pause without Look'd now pure worship of a heart set free; And worshipping she moved, from step to step Ascending. Then upon the last, with head Still bow'd, the vessel in her hands upraised, In the white flickering of the moon, she pass'd Within. But whether through an open'd door Or as pure spirits glide, finding no bar, Which of us seeks to know, and who shall say? Behold BEATA MEA in the House Of Many Mansions, now received in dream; And the good God, Who takes some souls in sleep But some in waking to their term in Him, Give her good issue out of dreams and all Which counts with us for waking, that true life And its most high fruition be hers in Him. I know not, ask not, through what halls or aisles Her heart's dream-images had drawn the maid: Were such my own adventure, beyond doubt, The sacraments of sleep would have been clothed In other vestures: unto each his dream And unto each its pageantry. But she In chantry or in chapel, transept, naveâ It matters littleâat due time attain'd That which was given to be reached, and so A valid moral to the quest of sleep. Altar or Tableâwas it that or this?â She stood enwrapp'd on one or other side And waited: the oblation of white Bread Within the Pyx seem'd light upon the hands Which held. A hush'd expectancy possess'd Her being, without haste and without search Tarrying awhile in very certainty, While in the stillness came a very sense Of God's most utter wholenessânothing slipp'd Apart or wanting. All her thought within Sank gently down into a calm, deep pool Of pure mind-being, from vicissitude And chequer of complexion perfectly Deliver'dâinto an embracing state Of uttermost awareness. So abide, BEATA, Altar and Ciborium Have left awhile no image in your heart, And there is nothing but the formless, free Unmodal certitude of God in all. What space of time unmeasured in her dream Elapsed, I know not. On such side of life That mute duration drawn within the self Was like a contemplation in the heartâ Unbiass'd by the mark of hours or days. But, still inwoven, at a certain point It grew within her that the vaulted place Encompassing was vastness in the vast Of halls and chambers. That which fronted her Show'd endless in the shadows, and the moon Through some interminable window shone Behind her, utterly remote. Thereat Her lifted eyes look'd forward, placid-like, Aware that having been alone, and long Within the measures of her single self, Such tide of circumstance was breaking here A last wave on the bourne. From what far end She knew not, growing into human shape, There came a figure which, with shining eyes, Held mute communionânot less deep than hersâ In his own being. Betwixt hands he bore A Chalice and drew on as one who moves But does not walk. The altar's further side Reaching, he paused. Thus did the man and maid Confront each other; so the Pyx and Cup Were met together in a Holy Place: So QUÃSTOR DEI and BEATA join'd Their life in dream. Another door than hers Received him; by another path he drew Within that House of Souls. The world of sleep Which him enfolded on the self-same night Had shown him hills encompassing, a steep And rocky way beneath a blending moon; And he went down, somewhat as one who toils, Proceeding slowlyânot as yet indeed Conscious of end, yet hearing in the heart An unvoiced witness that the mode of dream Led on to that of vision. In the hope Hereof, he fared among the hills and crags, Until at length they stood on either side Behind him, while in front the mystic Houseâ Vision indeedâloom'd suddenly acrossâ It might beâglebe-land in a great expanse. Now, on this side of it the moon was clear And the high mastery of the mighty pile Stood forth, sharp-angled towards the base and lost, If lost indeed, as spires and pinnacles Melting in yellow light, with all the depth Shut off in continuity sublime Behind. Hereat the mission'd seeker knew There came his first great moment of the quest, And his essential being leap'd within, As child in womb outreaching into birth. Thereafter, born into that world unknown, He cross'd the threshold. Thus, with open eyes But soul indrawn, at once most surely led And self-directing, worshipful, he pass'd High precincts, oriels and vaulted rooms, An altar reaching at the end, and sawâ Beneath moon-litten windowâthat white maid Hidden in contemplation and moon-veil Of unshaped nimbus. Whether spoken word Or thought's communion follow'd meeting eyes Shall matter not. The terms we use on earth Are sacraments of interchanging souls And thus we know each otherâbut in part, With bars between. If speech seems used in sleep, Perchance so only to our waking hours Can recollection in the soul convey Her messages from spiritual mind Through the material brain. Hence all is clothed In symbolsâthought and love. The modes of speech Are emblematic, like the arms' embrace And the entrancing meeting of the lips. Only in each and all we prove at times What unplumb'd wells remainâthe unexpress'd Withinâwhat fountains and what fires leap up Towards manifestation, but to fail therein. And then we know, beyond our space and time, Past shapes and ways of thought or loving act, We also, grafted on reality, Draw roots of being from the eternal world And flow through all things. She who sank therein And for the first time found her nature's deepsâ BEATA MEAâto the psychic state Returning slowly, and heâless withdrawn But rather vigilant in both his worlds For living vision as a crown of dreamsâ Saw in the half-light each the eyes of each Resplendent, growing from the human mode To high-uplifted spiritual states Wherein the God-ray from the centre pours Through every bond of being. There and thenâ As those who reach a place for rest ordain'd And find that Eden's bowers are not beyond The hammer'd pathways of a weary world, Or those who seek a hostel of the Lord Through convent-gate and reach a mercy-seat Shelter'd by wings of cherubimâwith one Accord they set the Chalice down and Pyx. Then with cross'd arms and interlinking hands They gave the watchwords of that secret hour Through inward reading eyes, perchance in speech, But most by sudden union of the soul, Far from all jar and shock, as quiet streams Converge and mingle, where the water-ways Meet on a level ground. How many Houses in Thy Name are builded And in the shadow of Thy presence dwell, By aspiration raised, while faith has welded The holy stones with craft of holy spell. But there is one behind them or above Which is not built of hands or heart of man, Great Architect thereof Eternal Love, Who built in wisdom ere the world began. From this the soul comes forth, to this returns: About it shines the Presence which is He; Abiding Glory in the chancel burns And blessed hierarchies their Master see. But past the chancel, past the Holy Place, As in an All-God dark of dread abyss, A plenitude of being and of grace, Lies that most hidden centre which is His. No forms emerge therefrom, no forms go in, But that which is not mode in me and you, An inmost root of being, dwells therein, Gulf-deep, beyond the viewing and the view. Now this is that from which we are, and by This does our endless to the endless cleave, Our spaceless with the unspaced unify. Seek, and all separating worlds retrieve: Beyond the silence and beyond the speech, Seek inward, soul of mine and soul of each. VII A Dream in the Quest of God The lonely ways Of long dream-life slipp'd from them silently. The spacious presages of things to come Spread vistas widely, peopled far and near With cohorts of prevision, angel-hosts Thronging a court of heaven. When something loosed All bounds and bonds, they stood as those on whom The kingship of the spiritual city Confers its freedom. In such hour the soul Enlarged its auras, and that moon which look'd From her far height upon them, with its beams, Form'd pallid background where each shone to each In radiant light of beauty. They beheld Enough of coming things to know that God And the Divine Ambassadors keep well The future ways, shaping them all in love To perfect ends. Moreover, in the glassâ Clear and bright-shiningâof each other's eyes They look'd and saw some part of that which lay Behind in their unfathom'd past of things. Not here and now their primal meeting-point, Nor in the sleep of far anterior worlds, Or waking life in elder days of earth, But in the spirit they had dwelt with Godâ Beyond distinctions of the twain and Himâ Together, He alone possessing all And all in Him: unsearchable unity, Infinite multiplicity. So came The gospel of their eyes and spoke itself Within their hearts, preach'd from the soul of both, Received and realized in heart and soul. The dream had grown to vision: if in sleep, It was a sleep in God. The eyes of her Were gates for an expanding universe, And the whole world was she, desired in God, In God receivedâa blessed sacrament, Image and type of Him. On her own part BEATA'S wells of being leap'd, and she Saw God alone in eyes through which she look'd, God in the cosmic vistas far prolong'd Beyond their gate, an unescapable, All-keeping love. And she herself became No longer loving or of things beloved But love itself, with God of God therein. Thus were they open'd and replenish'd thus Within them. Each to one another given Forecast not then concerning future lots And waking life together. They inwove At root, in essence, knowing that the bond Was not in holy house or place of dream Welded, but that which had for ever been, Though only now discovered. Being fill'd Themselves, they also saw the end of want Among the famish'd peoples of their sleep. So therefore in the Blessed and Holy House Of Many Mansions, inly moved thereto, And in a silence both of lips and heart, They seal'd refreshment and its grace attain'd, Communicating each to each the Bread And Wine, so long in separation borne, But now in union shared. A secret wealth Hidden in that communion raised for them Some further gates, sluice-gates of very light, As if through channels of the outward signs The life and substance of God's hidden deeps Flow'd in them and flow'd over and immersedâ A saturation of the Soul with God. One moment only they were drown'd therein, And all the canticles of saints and Kings, Whom God has visited in fullness, join'd In clamorous melody. It was good to dwell In the Lord's House, the beauty of that House O'er all desired; to stand within the gates Of this true Zion; to sing with golden tongue The mystery of eternal life in Him, As blood and body received in body and blood. They look'd towards that great day when all who strive In their poor hearts for God and Things Divine Shall feel their hearts a cellarage of God Press'd down, fill'd over, pouring through the streets Of spiritual cities; the worldly rich Left empty, till they also starve, and God Shall also them replenish. I have said One momentâvery transport, yet too still For words of mine. The spirits had dissolved Together, into God's great dark withdrawn. But they had far to travel in the soul And what befell them on one side of life To reach upon the other. Therefore this Viaticum of rapture came and went Flashwise, and never in their life of dream Did they come bearing Bread and Wine again To feed each other. At the end of all, When those who now stand in the Outer Court Shall cross the Holy Place and afterâraised Towards the Holy of Holiesâfind the last Most highest veil, perchance upon their call Awaiting, they may minister once more To one another, or the veil itself Be parted by a ministry behind. Then God shall draw them through, while other voice Than theirs recites the consummatum est. Quantum magnale Dei gaudium: Come, taste and prove the sweetness of the Lord, Glory of joy in Him, the King Whose joy Is to be known in hearts, Who else abides Unknown, received not in the part of life. Mayst thou, O Word of all, in all take flesh: Those which conceive Thee in embodied womb Of soul and bring Thee forth into their lives Shall make one flesh together, one heart and soul. Here are true marriages, my spouse, my loveâ BEATA MEA. Consummations here Are perfect for all life, death and beyondâ O QUÃSTOR DEI, spiritual friend, Most High Companion of the Holy Quest. So in one night of sacrament those twain Grew one into another: they were known And knew. Wide openings of the cryptic way Were made within them and the vistas shoneâ World upon world. At that still rapture's end They stood together, but now side by side, Bearing the Chalice and Ciborium For other needs than theirs. The light within Was light without, fair-flowing through the House. The Sacred Presence manifest within Show'd forth another Presence like theretoâ Nay, but the same and self-declared without, Through all the hallow'd images and veils, Though not set wholly free from certain clouds, As might be incense-fumes from thuribles Or sanctuary chant down nave and aisles Panting and pouring, muffling for the most That still, small voice which in the shrouded Pyx Recites the blessed privities of God. So muchâtowards vision in elected heartsâ Of many mansions in the House of God And chambers of the Presence. For what from me could hide Thee In worlds without I sought Who needed none beside Thee; But there I met with naught. With golden tongues for leading All Nature's glories preach, And beauty spreads for reading Her gospels, clear as speech. Where earths and skies and seas are, The witness never fails: Thy revelations these are And not Thy clouding veils. I only then conceal Thee: Strip off this self, and I Shall unto That reveal Thee Which not in self can die: A Thou within my being Which past all mine and me, My ways of thought and seeing, Is I at one with Thee. VIII A Garden of Life Beata mea on the search for God And QUÃSTOR DEI on the self-same quest, In expectation bless'd and looking forth Beyond their present measures, from the bonds Of these, towards ends attain'd and fruit thereof: Learn how it fared with both in waking ways, After the dreams and visions of the night Had open'd their new epoch in the life Of sleep and dual drama of the soul. She in sunlitten gardens of the house, Among the peacocks and fantastic treesâ Uncouthly shapedâat the glad morning-tide, Before the shining cityâfar belowâ Had waken'd fully; he from mesh of streets Emerging on the brimming river's side, Between the bridges; ponder'd on the night And that new gospel of the life of trance Which both had shared, though each to each unknown In outward ways. One dream-experience Therein, so also in the aftermath One thought was kindled in the mind and one Burnt in the heart of eachâthe when and where Of earthly meeting. Somewhere in the world She lived in flesh, somewhere he dwelt with men. No common hunger after human love Made quick that thought. They had not kiss'd in sleep, Since deeper ways are open to the soul, With soul in search of union. Mindful now Of that which was, no longing in the hearts Enter'd, but certitude of things to come Left therewithin a hundred doubts unsolved On what must follow meeting. Would their ways Be cast henceforth together? Nay, not thisâ Too preassured already. Would those twain Grow one in waking life? And nay, not that: No earthly life divides what sleep makes one When soul in vision is deeply bound with soul. But wheresoever such foreseen event Should cross the threshold of their circumstance, Would those great wells which they had sounded once Unseal again? Would past and future fling Gates open to the future and the past? Would they see farther back and yet more far Before them in the Mystery of God? They could not meet within the common bonds Of strangers: that was certain. Yet perchance The things within might cast on those without Pale reflex only, from true life apart And its unplumb'd reality. Perchance It must be so, for on the side of sleep Abode henceforth the very truth of truth, The constant light of light; but here, like shades Or aspens, flicker'd on the waking side All painted images of things without. At most on this the omens moved and shone, But there the great moralities. So sign And signified, in this the aftermath, Stood parted clearly on confronting banks Of being. Better in his heart he knew Than haply she that this was mood aloneâ And fleeting. Presently the focus lost Would find itself, the shifted balance turn, Adjust and compensate. For both no less The speculation issued and the doubt, Bearing their saving clauses at the end, Sinceâhowsoever it might prove at firstâ Not on one only side of life there dwells Reality, and not on one the soul Attains. The gates would open here as there, The deeps unseal; and late or soon the twain Should know each other, as in sleep they knewâ At one, and thus for ever. Granted this For utter certainty, and passing hence Unchallenged, there remain'd on either side A certain failing of the heart in face Of such foregone encounter, for the how Of its beginning, for grey common light Which might encompass, those first banal words Of greeting, that first obvious wonderment, For all the limits of mere earthly eyes, Slow growth in learning one another's ways, Status, pursuits, diurnal interests. What if at first those twain, so near in soul And fill'd with mission when the inward world Was lifting veils from off its infinite, Should in the manifest body and life to each Prove scarcely possible? What if meeting's doom Came on them at a corner of the streets, In hurry and drive of rain, draggled and drench'd? His more than hers this special pictured dread; But she had pictures. Setting those which bless'd To cancel those which tortured, she lived down The spaces of suspense, and he at last Discharged all images and look'd towards sleep. But this fail'd both: an utter blank in dream Had follow'd after that revealing night, Till they remember'd that the leaves of life In sleep turn'd slowly, discontinuous, Though nought seem'd miss'd, while any will of theirs For nothing counted. I have lived among the symbols Of Thy great dramas long; The pomp of Thy pontificals About me moves in song. Thine Art sends forth its tidings In all the play-scenes round me; Its grace uplifting Nature To her World-Rites has bound me. Give me High Grades for ever, All parts in Thy masques to try, More and yet more of Thy pageants, Their meaning and mastery. IX The Master Comes When a week had pass'd, As earthly air of old at times gave up Some blessed spirit in the guise of man, Orâwhen all doors were shutâthe risen Christ Stood in an upper room, invoking peace On true disciples, so life's native mode And daily sequence to BEATA gave One unto her as Masterânot that man Of vision with the chalice in his hands, Knowing and known in unity. Some two Or three mere shadows in the life of herâ Met there or here, at lecture or at homeâ Brought them together, from design apart, And something in the white-hair'd, travell'd man Had drawn her father. So at the right time, In the right way, by manifest design Untinged, he came who saw and knew within. Perhaps with open knowledge of her life In dream he came: she told him naught thereon. His silence notwithstanding, something spoke Within her and bore witness to the heart That neither waking life nor life of sleep Were hidden from his inward eyes. She felt Unveil'd before him who was veil'd to her, Though not indeed as one who vests himself In mystery, or willingly shuts fast The doors of secret spirit or of mind. He seem'd uplifted in the height of things, Beyond all common vision, into rest Of knowledge and possession in the still And active centre. She had seen the soul As one who on the threshold of a world Looks down its vistas. He abode therein And came not therefore with the types and signs Of outward sacraments, in bread and wine; As any spokesman of a church or creed, Of any system warranted by man; As bearing seals of mission, set on that Or thisâin high hypothesisâby God. His the authority of very life, Which makes no claim, but is and is confess'd. The fountain-springs of self-hood and its notes Were missing, and the impression so produced Was not of one who has effaced the self But, in the measures of a wider world Increased, has come into a higher state, Another heritage, a cosmic mode. Being that she was, no special words of his BEATA needed to communicate This and things deeper than such terms convey. His presence and its quality of life Awaken'd. As the incense in the church Entrances sense and thus the thurible, Amidst the blessed fragrance over aisles And nave, is counted nothing but goes by Unheeded, so the Master as a man Of flesh was in the nowhere and the naught For her, but allâin silence or in speechâ The life-evoking quality of life Which dwelt about him and for her was he. Moreover, on his lips our common words Took on another vesture. Had he talk'd Pure trifles, idly as an old man might, Or blended things which pass with things that stay And matter, lest a woman in her youth, Just raised from girlhood, find it hard to stand In thought at full attention, still his wordsâ To her at least and others tuned like herâ With life vibrating, would have pass'd life on And with deep modes of music stirr'd deep chords Of very soul within. A word indeed, But one sufficed, wherever God's great Name Was utter'd, for there flash'd through him to her Light plenary from infinite of things, As if it had been spoken from the heart Of Heaven. The path, the end of all her quest Were voiced therein. She felt the sacrament Of simple words, and the dry bones of speech Lived, moved: so utter'd in the depths of her They traversed all her galleries and crypts. She answer'd from the soul in sympathy Of understanding loveâat times with lips, More often in that silence of the mind Which answers fully through the speaking eyes. So learn'd she and so grew. He spoke at times Of Hidden Mysteries in Holy Church. Then all distinctions between Church and World Were brought to nothing; there was unity Of Grace and Nature, being Grace in all; And this was Nature raised upon the heights Of holiness. On woman and on man He spoke, and there was oneness in the depth And height of consecrate humanity, Sub specie amorisâso aloneâ Regarded: all was kingship and high light In the great vistas opening before And round them. It recall'd that vision-state When her soul open'd and the soul of him Who stood upon the farther altar-side, While far beyond that prefatory state Lay other worlds of union, here reveal'd To mind alone. And she remember'd too That at the close of such high change in sleepâ She knew not howâthe altar interposed No longer; but they, standing side by side, Prepared upon a predetermined path To take their course and so perchance exchange A state of soul far looking into soul For two in one abiding self-immerged. Observe, her Master never chose a theme As one with office to discourse thereon, Nor ever spoke as teacher. That and this Of each high subject out of this and that, Among the seeming accidents of things, Issued, and self-presented unawares Became their theme which heaven-born wisdom's art Seal'd with great Nature's own simplicity. Music of words which subtly work'd their spell Outside all conscious knowledge or intent, And silence after as at end of song: I know not which gave most, but both had light And warmth of teaching for the need she had, While her responding nature lifted up Andâas a tree of many roses draws The life-increasing dewsâdrew springs of speech Within, or sheen of subtle silences, As rose from golden sun derives at once Beauty and nutriment. So too, as this Gives forth a royal fragrance in return, She radiated quick with sympathy, True understanding, answers from the heart. Thus was there antiphon and fair response Continually between them, and behind The outward Church of Nature and of Grace She pass'd in spirit to the Church within, And through such incense of the Master's words Beheld the Blessed Mystery of all Inward experience taking outward form. The Sacramentum ineffabile, The Holy Graal upheld by priestly hands Shone out dilucid over altar height. But afterwards alone, in worship rapt And ravish'd, reverent over radiant Cup Bent the adoring face of him who stood Before her in the many-mansion'd House, While she, Pyx-Bearer, held on virgin breast The great white secret which is Bread of Life. This aspect ceased. Thereafter, side by side Standing, the sacred vessels glow'd in light Together. Then a little while, and then One vessel only, which was Pyx and Cup, Till this dissolved, and Christ between them stood One moment's space. Valete, time and life, All separate sense of being and of thought; But that which was and is and is to come Abode alone in them and they thereinâ Eternal Life in Christ. But thence return'd Within the normal measures of our life, BEATA MEA, by the reasoning mind, Discern'd in part and very far away That in some sense to be hereafter known Her nature answer'd to the Bread she bare And must be changed into the Bread of Life, While heâbrought strangely into worlds of dreamâ Stood in some deep relation to the Cup He carried and must suffer change himself, Till that which answer'd to its wine became The Wine of Life, Blessed and Holy Graal. Thy Word is buried in the heart of man, Below the life of sense: Of all creation Thou art life and plan, The essence and the immanence. But, ah, for us the hidden Godhead sleeps In cosmic Nature and is veiled in ours, Till something calls it from unsounded deeps To rise within us and unfold its powers. Then shall great Nature stir And putting sleep for us away from her Shall also wake. How shall that morning break? O not in East or West alone And not from here or there: At once and everywhere The Christ Who comes within is seen and known, The Voice of Life is heard, Life of all life and Word. O admirable Presence, Voice Divine, Thy world is ours and mine; And to Thy light, transfigured, shall respond In light the worlds without us and beyond. X The Way of the Waterside Beyond the city, by the South and West, Far over fields and meadows, heath and down, By stream and fell, in recollected thought Fared QUÃSTOR DEI, at the quiet end Of this same week wherein the dream of sleep Had grown for him to vision; and he kept That sacred vision and the maid thereof Companions chosen of the peaceful way. All omens, portents of the natural world And all the gracious lesser outward signs Gave up their meanings in the sense of hopes Which overflow'd him from the world within, While the two worlds, reacting each on each, Found both enlarge their borders. So there came A certain hallow'd noon, when leafy ways Of woodland labyrinths melted in the light, And the light sifted through a thousand sprigs And branches, moving subtly overhead. Round and about was like a Pentecost, With little tongues of fire in open spots Moving and murmuring on the edge of speech. Thereâunaccountable, unsought, unknownâ At the fence-side, over against a stile Which gave on level meads, the meads on brook Below, the brook upon a hamletâdrawn About its little ancient churchâit fell That QUÃSTOR DEI and the Master met. What profitâwere it possibleâto say How rose the flimsy veils which first divide Two strangers, predetermined each on each To interact? The upward-pointing spire Seen in the distance, or the slipping burn Between its bridges, yea, the ravish'd scream Of larkâsong-burstingâhidden in the high Glory of lightâthese three or one of these Could break the bar, could lift so light a yoke Of silence. Howsoever, in a space More brief than that which intervened unmark'd Between the hour and quarter of the old Church clock, all bonds were melted, and the heart Of QUÃSTOR DEI to the Master's heart Was open'd. Here again no word of sleep, With its strange pageants; and the poet keptâ As one whose inmost issues not in words Even at deep communion, soul to soulâ His tale of agony and endless death Buried in wells of silence. Might perchance Recital bring that phantom back to life? Or was it dead so utterly that words Could scarce evoke the images? I know They spoke of symbols and their work in sleep, Meanings behind them, parables of dream, Of dreams which lead to vision, but apart From any vestige of the self therein On either side of its experience. For certain days the leading, so begun, Continued there and here, as seeming chance Gave out the ways and means. And whatsoe'er The Master knew of those two inward lives, He led the other as He led the one To one same point, which was the Holy Graal In manifested aspects and in deeps Withdrawn of hidden meaning. Do I need To say that both into the heart of heart Received his message, ponder'd thereupon And treasured? That which had been long remote, Some matter of romanceâand heard perchance At second hand, or scarcely heard at allâ Began to live within them and unfold As light upon familiar ways of sleep. In part to her who bore the mystic Pyx There came its message on the verso page Of life; more fully he beheld who served The Cup in sleep; but both beheld and read. So in the light of late experience, When Pyx and Cup, the woman and the man, Were brought together, it seem'dâfor their two livesâ The Holy Graal was going up and down The world, as once it went in Arthur's days. Was it a finding of the Graal for them, The second advent of the Wounded King, Himself made whole and bringing healing back To a wounded world? On many songs to come The poet dwelt in mind. In mind and heartâ But more and deeper in the secret heartâ BEATA dwelt on life and thought and love, Hidden within the Hallows of the Cup, But most upon that moment of the Mass When priestly hands divide the Sacred Host And in the consecrated Wine there slips And sinks one particle of Living Bread. As if meanwhile his modest part were done In this first act, the Faithful Master moved Aside, and in a while the act fulfill'd Itself. A silent interlude ensued, And then this drama of a double life Reopen'd suddenly on wider scenes. A star was mine, and on its throneâ In kingly state, to earth unknownâ I ruled star-nations far and wide, As one who has been deified. Thou wast not there: too far behind The compass of my regal state, I could not hear Thy voice or find From mine to Thine an open gate. In chapel, fane and minster fair Thine altars blazed with flowers and light; Thine images were everywhere, Thy worship sounded day and night: Thou wast not there, Thou wast not there. A star on earth or star in heaven, What boots it if all stars be given, So clouds Thy face of beauty hide? What boots a crown, and Thou denied? My throne is vacant and my star Is left where other signets are: If Thou be with me, all is mine, But all is naught till all is Thine; If Thou be absent, well-a-day, Stars will not help me on my way. Better to wait in weeds for Thee Than rule, a Lord of earth and sea, Apart from Thee, apart from Thee. XI Food of Heaven They pass'd again into the sleep of dream And vision; and again they met therein. A certain consciousness of time elapsed Was with them, never realized before, Elusive now, no break in the events Suggesting, rather some subsurface law Which interlink'd them on both sides of life And mark'd one sequence. The next stage of sleep Would issue therefore from the waking stage Of being and henceforward lead in turn Through some assembly of external things To follow on. But now it came no moreâ Did it come everâwith a sense of doom Unfolding and of actors used therein As doll's house manikins. Their human will Had all at once been married to an end And purpose which in every process spoke Of Higher Will, shaping with those who shaped On their own part. O sacred interchange By which through all the ages of the world The partnership of God and man directs The great redeeming work. So souls are led. So souls obtaining knowledge of themselves Look back from their attainments and confess They could not choose but coincide and lead Their nature-wills to that most perfect point When they henceforth are taken. Yet the choice Was theirs, as driven by themselves in love, Not God-compell'd, Who yet compels by love; For working with the whole is love's constraint And an ineffable freedom, love-insured. Thus are we loosen'd always in the great High things of being and are bound alone In law of trifles. God and His good ends Are reach'd in liberty; the lesser self Spins ropes, makes rivets, forges heavy chains To yoke itself, and perishes therein. Yet from that body of death may the live self Rise up to vindicate the race thereof, The freedom and the royalty in God. The SEEKER-POET and BEATA moved Amidst the many mansions of the House, And there was morning in the world without Its portals. As upon the moon of soul The self-source light of spirit on a day Arises and the soul dissolves therein, To dwell henceforward in the Sun of Christ, So pass'd for them that quiet moon of dream Which through the windows of the House had look'd When soul for soul had lifted veils and thrown The gates wide open. Morning gold and red Emblazon'd all the East; and the Sun rose. It seem'd to both as if that blessed light Had never shone before on their dream-world. Dark under stars at times, at others glow'd The portent of a red unradiant moon, Low-stooping towards the West, while in the day Dark vapours blotted out the vault above, Or at the most the dim light through the clouds Gloom'd, and perchance flung through a jagged patchâ Might slantwise fall some transitory gleam. Now it was light ineffable and now Glory of living freshness, glory of pearl, Of rose and amethyst, a second birth Of Nature. Now the Many Mansion'd House Received the light without and gave it back From plinth and pilaster and arch and wall, While evermore its depths, from space to space, Open'd, with domes, with chapels and with navesâ An endless Temple. But the Holy Place, At the imputed East far and away, Behind a rood-screen and the shining woof Of a golden curtain, from the vaulted height To base extended, heal'd its mysteries. There pour'd forth only an enkindling sense Of presences; and within, behind, above That first suggestion, something undeclared, August and dreadful loom'd. Thereat the heart Still'd beatings and the offices of thought Broke on the threshold. Was it of the One Spirit, withdrawn upon Itself, which gives Their life to hierarchies whose cohorts fill The courts, the palaces, the jewell'd streets Of Zion? Were they facing unawares A porch of still eternity, or well Of infinite being, God-head self-immersed, Which in the spirit-body of the House Gave notions of immeasurable range? For those who moved in the soul-part of them Through aisle or nave, back from the Golden Veil Self-press'd, were conscious not of awe alone, Or that which lies too deep for ghostly dreadâ But distance past all travel. So it was With QUÃSTOR DEI and BEATA, brought Through many precincts into mighty aisle, From aisle to nave. The Presence put them back, Till as from to star the distance show'd Between them and the curtain's blazon'd screen Of glittering cloud. What awful Mercy-seat Was fix'd behind and through that gorgeous veil Pour'd rays from GLORIA INHABITANS? And would that veil at some determined point Of their advancement open to admit Their introgression from the Holy Place Into the utter Adytum, Holiest Among the Holies? Where a window sprang From base to height, the risen Sun, above Pale vapours, and with never lightest cloud Throughout the welkin, pour'd upon themâthere Kneelingâregenerate glory of its own And clothed and crown'd them. For a moment, thus Transform'd, it fell upon the Pyx and Cup, And there and then, beyond the Golden Veil, The glory that was ineffable within Sent down a shaft ineffable and caught These vessels in the network of the light, Whereat within the metal began to move A life which never in the dream before Had stirr'd and trembled. So the priestâsublimed In sanctityâon Bread and Wine invokes The life of Christ, the body and the blood, And life is there. The Bearers bow'd their heads And all was heaven within them for a space, By thought indrawn. The Bearers rose and stood, Midwise in nave, while unseen thuribles Swung round about them, filling the still air With other incense than ascends on earth, And in the centre of those hallow'd fumes Yet sweeter fragranceânot of incense burnt In heaven or earthâpast psychic senses stole, Till it was with them, for a moment's space, As when the spirit is alone with God, In God's great rapture. Incense, solar light, The golden glory of the Veil, the House Of Many Mansions in that space dissolved, And there was neither earth nor very heaven, But only God; while ravish'd, out of self, In the love-state of being, they beheld And were and realized in Him aloneâ As love that is, and is alone and one. So was it, till the glory was withdrawn Behind the Veil; but this remain'd to shine With its own splendour, and the blessed sun, In the salvation of its natural light. An inward impulse brought the Bearers back To conscious presence in the Holy House, Their rapture done: an inner impulse turn'd Their faces westward. Where the distanceâvast But not beyond our measuresâshadow'd forth A western wall, the Portal of the House And all its miracle of stone and wood, Of carvings and of images, they saw Loomingâuncertain, wonderful. With Cup And Pyx upraised, that impulse prompted still The Bearers. Passing through the medial space, The Portal's majesty of breadth and height, Line upon line of symbol and of saintâ Known and unknownâhigh messages in words Heart-flaming, doctrine of all hidden life, Maxims and mastery of sentences, Held eyes and mind, their very heart of heart In homage. So it was a worshipful Space as of well-deep stillness, whereupon There supervened a state of hush'd, alert Expectancyânot silence, for they felt All chords vibrate within them. New event Stirr'd on the threshold, and its rumours woke An answer from their inmost. Not a word Was utter'd or was needed, for the flash Of understandingâas through lambent eyesâ From each to each spoke eloquently. Pyx And Cup yet farther in the shade and light Were lifted, while the mode and mien of each, High in the act exalted, swept from grade To grade of recollection, reverence, Devotion: this to adoration grew, Then loveâbeginning at the human best, But afterwards transumed, it shone divine. God's love was in their faces and God's work Inspired them. Now they paused, nor scarcely knew Of waiting, till the gracious thing to come, As crossing threshold, on the actual Emerged. Nor slowly, nor with strident haste Slipp'd back the Portal's mighty double leaves; And moving forwardâstill as those enwrapp'dâ Erect between the pillars of the House The Bearers stood, like vested priests prepared For ministry. About the courts and steps Of that immeasurable edifice, A multitude of women and of men Crowded and sway'd: and still the old, old want Was scored upon their faces. But whereas That which all recently befell within Had alter'd aspects in the ways without, Something had enter'd in those wither'd hearts And expectation now exceeded want. Sun-clarity and sheen, with every mark Of life abounding and world's weal therein, Warm'd also these, enlighten'd and bestirr'd Unwonted pulses, as of ends declared, Great new beginnings. So when those vast doors Reveal'd the overwhelming nave within, Whilst the gold curtain's glory glow'd and gleam'd Where eye could scarcely follow in the far, An universal sobbing of tremulous hope And prayer of pent distress went up and down The concourse. Hush'd into an undertone, There stirr'd some currents of dead hopes re-born, Of wonder and desire engirt with awe, And loosed bonds slipp'd. For which of all had seen That Temple in old dim-light of the world? If any, which of them in gloom of night Or day, had come upon its Portal cast Open before them, and had look'd therein? Those Bearers truly through the sad grey land Had moved and minister'd; but now they stood Thus, in the nimbus of an aureate light Transfigured, and the vessels in their hands Not only gave back glory shining round But were made quick with splendour of their ownâ Subtle, innate and spiritual. Thus It came about that, prompted suddenlyâ As one togetherâupon bended knees That congregation fell; and the great work For QUÃSTOR DEI and BEATA there And then began. In rapture and in trance Of ministry, communicating and themselves Receiving, over and above all signs Of sacraments, on the morning of that dayâ Out of all days taken and set apartâ They fed five thousand in the wilderness Of morning glory, as with Living Bread And Wine of Being. The partakers there Had very sustenance, to heart's content: So was there want no longer in that world, And a deep sense of God within the soul Was felt abiding. They arose in light Of innermost refreshment. The old scales Fell from their eyes, so that for theseâas those Who minister'dâthat wilderness whereon Such Day-Star broke was seen as Paradise; And a TE DEUM never sung on earth Peal'd forth triumphant on the lips of allâ The gratitude, the knowledge and the joy Of such as find that God in very truth Dwells with His people. At the end hereof The House of Many Mansionsâin its depth Of light and graceâreceived the Bearers back. The Portals, with a blessing for the world, Closed on them in a worshipful melody Of motion; and the conclave thereupon Was scatter'd on its proper paths and ways. Each man and woman, to their call in life Returning, realized the call of God Therein, so therefore went about His will And work in peace of the concurring heart. Peace in the cottage, peace in hall and keep, The grace of union and the bliss thereof: O Rose and Lily of that new morning tide, Feast of the Substance and the Life Divine. When each partaker had that joy which most He long'd for served from a most plenteous dish, Truly the Holy Graal about the world Was moving, and the end of perilous times, Of hard adventure, of the want of man, Had dawn'd, for man was satisfied in God. So QUÃSTOR DEI and BEATA fed Their famish'd multitude in a wilderness. A vision in the night Of a place that is far away, On a certain sacred height Which few can gain: in a secret fane At the gospel-side Of an altar strangely bless'd An open Mass-Book lay. Till I knew them over and over, again, again I have read the words therein; And now in this aureate Easter morning tideâ Praise GodâI have brought them back from the farther side. They are words of peace and light; All other words above, they are words of love: They are sacred words of rest. Who knows my art? Who knows? An altar of repose I have made in the heart within. O Sacred Host, O Wine and Bread, Those secret things in the heart are said, And where no foot of man has trod I have learn'd how to look for God. XII A Man and Maid Not in the secret paths, or sacred house, Built up by hands of men, or any place Far from the busy turmoil and its haunts; But just within the free-born country-side, Rich in a light of summer afternoon, Among the trees and where a simple stream Slipp'd through its edges of green herb and grass, The Blessed Master brought the Man and Maid Together, and between them took his seat. No regnant epoch in the life of two Began more simply. Any story told Of human lovers, meeting once and then Inbound for ever, might have found its place In such a setting. Was his art perchance For this the greater? If indeed he knew The secret working of the heart in each And all the deep misgiving gather'd round This first encounter of the twain in flesh, No words betray'd the knowledge, and no words Did homage to conventions of the world When they were set together face to face. How did he shape the normal chance of things To make them meet? The woman by his side Was seated haply, or on clover turf Knelt, as she often did, with her clasp'd hands Across his knees. Thereafter came the man, Parting the leafy vintage from behind, Or down some path's declivityâbetwixt The beech and birch. Some accidents of great Events stand round them unobserved, and loveâ Amidst the epochs in the life of loveâ Retains not all the images of that And this about it. Whether therefore these Keepers of sacred love within the soulâ And some abysses of experience Beyond the compass of the name of love In this our region of similitudeâ Did in their hearts preserve the lesser things Of that deep searching moment, who shall tell? Not I at least, nor what was firstly said By him who sat between them. This I know: On their own part the silence held them each, But granted such a meeting of true eyes As spoke more potently than words of earth On recognition, knowledge held within And mysteries of being otherwhere Which each had shared in each. As these flared up They made a sudden glory of mien and face, While all suspicions of the faithless past Fell from their present blessing and no wrack Of recollection left. It came about, In high simplicity which seals both worlds, Thatâas perchance across the Master's kneesâ The hands of each stretch'd over and were clasp'd, And with a worshipful purity of mouth They kiss'd each other under the blue sky, In Nature's happy sunlight. Then it seem'd That fountain-melodies of hidden birds Were sprinkling all the spaces, though in truth They heard them not till coming back to life Of open senses. So on either side Of that Wise Master who had shaped their ends They kept, in silence still, and heard His voice As if within the singing of the birds, Like tongues of grace which give to Nature's tones Another life and meaning. Surely both Had learn'd already in divided ways, On his wise part, that which had seem'd to each Raised up from wells of wisdom lying deep Within his holy undiscover'd world Of being. As great poets speak in song And unmistakable authority Of inspiration so compels mankind, It cannot choose but hear, and having heard Does not alone with clamour of the heart Make answer, but the very heart of some Seems speaking in the music and the words, Until the poet's messages become A part of life and ready on the lips Are pass'd for evermore from mouth to mouth: So QUÃSTOR DEI and BEATA heard Of old, with every pulse arrested, then With pulses quicken'd, then with far prolong'd Heart beatings, then with stillness of the heart, And finally with fully waken'd soul, Responding both in silence and in speech, And from the midmost and the very ends Of their two natures filling with the light Of understanding, as all heaven and earth Are fill'd with light at noon. This for the past, This for its sever'd ways, for dowers therein. But in the present linking of their lives It was as though some intervening bar, Unnoticed, had been raised. They knew not how, They knew not what: this only standing forthâ That something potent here unloosed and freed The Master's tongue, Who spoke as never yet He spoke to either in divided daysâ From such deep places of experience. He might have lifted up anointed hands At that great Altar's eastern end, when they Stood looking towards each other in the House Of Many Mansions; might have moved between The Bearers passing down the Temple's nave To feed the hungry in the wilderness. What other Houseâor so it seem'd to themâ But that which vision had reveal'd and led Their souls within, was limn'd by burning words, He speaking of the hidden head and font Of spiritual mysteries, a House Not made with hands, a Temple whence the grace And knowledge flow to sanctify the world In and by Christ, the Spirit and the Man, The Immanent Divinity shown forth In human nature? Known by many names, Far up and down the ages and the world, Its echoes and reflections of the life Divinely hidden in the heart of God Had spread. House of the Spirit, Hidden Church, The School of Heaven and Brotherhood elect: Therein abides the Christ Who once on earth Was Chief and Crown of all the Messengers. The earthly Master, hail'd in heart as such By both his hearers, though no claim of his Assumed the title, though he pass'd indeed On many missions bearing a plain nameâ That witness testified concerning Him Who still is Master here on earth, in heaven And in the underworld, for those who call On His great Name, and for all chosen souls Under the Ã¦gis of the Christian world. House, Palace, Temple, howsoever styled, The Sanctuary of His Presence, when He walksâ Seen or unseen, but ever seen in heartâ Amidst the Blessed Company and School Is that most sacred source of valid grace Which flows through all the Sacraments of Grace And Nature. Thus with power the Master spoke As one proficient in the secret things Of high communication and the modes By which the world derives not only life But sustenance. To two of all that world The timeless certitude behind such words Gave what the message, of this power deprived, Could not itself impart, the seal of one Who from the centre of experience Came forth to witness, who had dwelt within That hidden Temple, realized and shared The presence of that Immanence Divine Which is the core of this created world. After a space wherein the stillness seem'd Like Nature sleeping in the arms of God, Or like the calm activity of God Within the sacramental veil of things Made manifestâso that his hearers touch'd, For that brief moment in their waking state The vibrant centre of essential lifeâ Again the Blessed Master spoke and said: âBeyond that Temple there is unity, And Thou and I, changed over from this mode Of being which abides in self of self, Are henceforth bosom'd in the self of God, Know Him, and are deliver'd from the bond Of our own knowing. He is All in all, And we in Him, no more from all apart, Are integrated with the whole in all. The world's great joy is with us and within, While our self-joy is in the mighty world. Here is the true theopathy of rest And here the true activity, at once âDivine eventâ and that which works thereto, Andâbeing raisedâuplifts the lesser things, With all that in creation moves to reach Beatitude, perfection, mastery. So come we at the end into our own And this receives us.â On his hearers fell Another stillness, as of inward soul. The Master's voice had died, or if He spoke They knew not. The enlightening word became The silence, but the light therein shone out, Dissolving and transfiguring. All stir Of Nature fell away in one last chord, And this was hush'd. Ineffably those twain Were pour'd together; each became in each One ens transcendant. They were poised therein Almost across the threshold of a state Which was but prefaced in the Holy House. Great issue of an instant from the known Of being's aspects, in such flash of time That pass'd which was not of itself contain'd In measures of duration. Then the tones Of Nature's voices enter'd once again By normal avenues of sense. The twainâ A little dazedâfor one more moment saw Creation with the focus of their eyes Striving to readjust. Thereafter came The Master's voice, while his right hand was lock'd Within the two hands of the Man and Maid. Once more in soul or spirit he might have stood Between them, they bearing the Pyx and Cup In their dream-place of holy mystery. Then the diaphanous brightness of the world About themâand the beauty everywhere Purified and upliftedâgave them back, Through all their channels, a still vaster sense Of Temple and of Sanctuary. Behind Their veilsâwhich any moment, in between The Master's words, might lift or melt awayâ The sacred cosmos quiver'd to disclose The sacred place of true experience, The Holy of the Presenceânot indeed To eyes of flesh, nor even eyes of soul, But heart within the soul and heart of hearts. The Master speaking of the Master Christ Said that He came carrying Bread and Wine. These were His visible symbols; these He raised From signs of Nature into signs of Grace, To manifest analogies betwixt The food of body and the food of souls, The nutrimental matter of the world And that God-substance lying hid therein, Its life and essence. So these two dissolve One into other; so the Daily Bread Becomes as Bread of Angels; so the Wine Which cheers and fortifies the natural man May also be the Wine of Other Life Unto the man within. The pregnant scheme Of sign and symbol, for all those who dwell In the two worlds without dividing them But equally partaking, is maintain'd In marriage union with that noumenal Which signs show forth. The Eucharist is thus A bond between the worlds, for this bequeathed, A link of union in the height and deep. The Spirit of the Christ remains therein On every altar and in every soul Which can receive the Spirit. So is God Made man in Christ, and so the Word takes flesh Through all the ages. There is Bethlehem In every kingdom, country, shire and town. The world itself is Nazareth. Each man And woman in the body-part of them Is Bethlehem's stable. But the soul therein Is seldom Mary, bearing Christ within. Hence is the Hidden Church from age to age In travail, working towards that perfect day When Christ shall have been born of every soul, Or when the soul shall know the Christ within, And the most blessed offices of Bread And Wine shall reach fulfilment. Then the soulâ God-tinctured, God-transmuted, God-possess'dâ Shall need these signs no more. Till that great day The Hidden Church has sent out messengers With rumours of a noumenal Eucharist, Doctors and saints and mystics more than all. But once through legend and through high romance The Secret Church sent out the Holy Graal. After these words that kind of silence fell Which indicates the end of things attain'd, Or their suspension for some given time. The hearers look'd into their Master's face And saw how joy was also peace therein. He link'd their hands together, rose and then Standing behind them rather than between, While they two drew together, his own hands Extended, blessing silently, and left By the ascending path between the trees: The trees received the Master out of sight. In the morning of life, But the morning was sombre and sad: There was mist upon valley and street And sadly, with wearyful feetâ How pale in the morning of lifeâ Came love, full of tears, to the lad. I did not know it, and woe is me, Thus early and only I look'd for Thee. In the noonday of life There came with a crown to the man, Strong, stedfast and starry of birth, A love for the life of earthâ So fair in the noonday of lifeâ To dwell on the earth for a span. Great gifts are gracious, such gifts were given: But, Earthly Love, what of Love in Heaven? In the evening of life, In an ashen glow, on a path alone, It was Thou, Whom I look'd for from first to last: I found Thee, I have Thee, I hold Thee fastâ Soul-Lord in the evening of lifeâ Thine be my leading through ways unknown: They are known in Thee; they are paths above; In the arms which enfold me, all paths are love. XIII Of Spiritual Marriage Those whom a strange election had in sleep Granted a grade of union never reach'd In earthly nuptialsâor if reach'd indeed By some few souls, no record rests on earthâ Thus left together, having hand in hand, Look'd once again into each other's eyes; As soul in soul had look'd when purposed dream Had grown to vision, after gates unbarr'd And veils uplifted. Now the eyes of both Show'd deeps within and light upon the deeps; But eyes of flesh are not true doors of soul, While fleshly veils do not in waking states Strip off their vestures. So perchance for this They did not kiss in solitude, who kiss'd At their first greeting. When the witness sat, A golden link of spirit them between, His presence meted freedom in the heart. No yoke constrain'd them now; but something pass'd, And in the precincts left its place unfill'd, With him. Awhile the sunlight and green leaves Were things of Nature to herself return'd, Not seen in trance of spiritual joy. Mayhap the greeting kisses to their own Drew added sanctity of grace and light From springs within the Master, while apart From him that high observanceâfor a spaceâ Seem'd best held over. Whether best or not I rule in no wise, since by many ways Soul reaches soul. However, so they sat, True lovers, unto whom external signs Of love incarnate and the house of flesh In scant wise profited. A little while, And they were speaking of their state in dream, Together drawing on the outward side From more to more. Withal a certain sense Of want unsatisfied, of cloud in thought, Or such disparity, had breathed betwixt And importuned the consciousness of both. How light a sense, how very rare a veil, Was best, I think, exhibited when each Found ready terms in freedom thereupon And earn'd, moreover, in the speech exchanged An interlinking like the state of soul In sleep, however far the distance stretch'd To make a phantom of comparison. She gave him both her hands. He took them both In sudden silence momently. To him And her it was at once as if a queen Had offer'd hands and in the act became Earth-queen no longer but of sacred realms Explored in part, while other worlds beyond Stretch'd through the undiscover'd. Unto her And him it was as though a priest and king Came out of Salem, carrying Bread and Wine, The healing of the nations in his hands. And she acclaim'd him ever in her heart Priest of the Most High God. They knelt anon, Facing each other, while the falling sun Cast slantwise beams upon them and betwixt, And made another glory in the world, Transmuting gold to amber, building up Nimbus on nimbus, crown and aureole, Till all the simple blossoms of the wildâ Daisy and buttercup and celandineâ Shone round them, gleaming, glowing on the sward, Then changing suddenly to things most rich, Most rare. So was it, and again to both Transfigured Nature, full of radiant dyes, Discover'd pageants by the world at large Unseen, beyond the violet and the red, Glamour ineffable of gorgeous hues, Of tints betwixt the purple and the blue, Orange and yellow, like a soul within Great Nature, pouring from behind all bands And lines and crannies. Out of grassy nest A bird sprang up and in the middle heaven Scream'd high Graal overture of melody, And hideen runnels by the path and hedge Began to speak in silver undertones Intelligibly. No longer in the world Did hearts which âneed a languageâ seek in vain. All spoke, and in the tongue native to eachâ From summer breeze between the leaves, from loud And resonant organ-tones over the hills, To whatsoever moved and what was still Far over earth. Places of silence spoke, And that which spoke gave silence to the heart, While very stillness profited in speech To ears of soul. So was it and would be: But at that moment when they look'd and saw, About the mauves and ochres of the hills Which made their jewell'd ring on that world's verge, The changing splinter'd light of many rays Flung there and here, a thousand little tongues Of lambent fire and light flickered and fled, Or dwelt and hover'd up and down the slopes, And there was flowing as of streams of light, While round and through the pillars of the piled Upland on upland in the middle West, An opening for the departing sun Reveal'd a cosmic heart of ardent fire Beneath abysses of green. Hereat the wind Veer'd suddenly, pour'd forth its warm life-breath, Till there was Pentecost for those two hearts, Once and henceforth for ever in the world. In that great moment's glory, suddenly struck Out of the open globeâas fire from flintsâ They might have raised their voices, kneeling still, Amidst the mystic pentecostal tongues. But there were harps sounding within the spheres Of each, to hold them silent, and they heard That tongue of tongues which has no voice on earth, An utterance of the cosmic word withinâ Infinite love, infinite melody, The very root of all the life in life Of earths and worlds. So the misfaith and doubt Utterly perish'd. Those who met in soul, And not till later in the body of each, Knew one another, nor beheld therein That real things were very far away; But rather for the work of dream in sleep And work of waking vision there was reach'd A certain centre, a most holy ground To build on. It foreshadow'dâas on verge Of living knowledgeâthat those dual states, Reacting on each other, should produce An end of being, welded, unified, Which never surely in divided life Of outward sense or inward deeps might reach Such measure of fruition. Therefore flesh, Seen in this light of spiritual things, Profited something. Not as through a glass And darkly, in the common life of earth, They look'd at one another, for the world And mundane light, transfigured from within Their own transmuted natures, enter'd now Another grade of dignity and wore New robes of glory. When the parting came, For that or this allotted space of time, They would not leave unsatisfied but fill'd, And with no hunger in the world henceforth Awaiting them. The hour of sunset came And in the evening purples and the puce, Amidst the lifted thuribles which smoked In answer to the falling dews and gave A temple-scent like unto breath of life, They stood together and were folded up In one another's arms. It was again Two souls which met and kiss'd and interlock'd, While all the motions and desires of flesh Went up to God, like incense born of dews From weeds and flowers about them. Heaven's blue dome, Out of its phosphor, brought forth liquid starsâ Like Sons of God in contemplation still And vibrant, full of witness and of joy. All weary burdens of the world of sin, Letting and hindrance, fell from off their hearts. In love's great worship and high reverence The blessed goodness of the Lord of Good Was with them in the Land of Living Things. So they were married in their hearts of flesh, To ratify a union in the soul By rite most perfect, catholic and pure, Beyond all need of ministry from man, All consummations which the outward rites Do consecrate for earthly needs and ends, Nor yet reducing offices of these And holy sacraments of outward Church, Or laws of state, but entering withal A world of higher measures, hidden life Of union, intercourse of nuptial souls, As fully seal'd in the external ways By marriage intercourse of mouth and mouth, Or arms in arms, as by the five pure points Of fellowship in nuptial modes of earth, And with the centre. When the night had come They parted on their proper earthly ways And made no covenants of meeting, there Or here, well knowing that the world of dream Should give them back the Altar and the House, The Bearers' Office and the Rite therein, While in the world of those who think they wakeâ But are encompass'd by another sleep Until they waken both in dream and lifeâ Unmeasured vistas, stretch'd through place and time, Held opportunities at every point For meetings and renewals. Which of these Should most befit the purpose of their days That blessed purpose would itself declare; And in the perfect certitude hereof, Each looking only in the eyes of each And each commending each to God's true care, They leftâand look'd not backâin holy joy. The Master, leading over earthly ways, Stood in the middle night, and the great dome Of starry heaven watch'd with him, when the world Was sleeping. As it might be, from a peak He watch'd the city and its ways of menâ I know not: or the city was asleep And with the stars he watch'd, as it might be, On tower or lonely parapet or bridgeâ I know not. Wheresoever, unto starsâ With eyes uplifted and extended armsâ He reach'd out, inly worshipping, in trance Of thought imploring. Then beyond the stars, Out of all signs, transported in pure mind, His soul soar'd through the Immanence Divine To God transcendent, and enfolded there His wordless prayer was fix'd upon the end Towards which his son and daughter of desire Were takenâin some part surely by him But for the rest by the invisible Keepers of mysteries. Be they drawn and brought Thereby within the shelter of its arms, As he was drawn unsearchably and found A place within the palace and the shrine. At that ineffable centre which fulfils In oneness the within and the without Be God discern'd not only of their hearts And known of soul, but He abide in them And they in Him, a perfect being-state At once of God in all and all in God. Beyond the prayer of rapture and the prayer Of silence drawn into a deeper mode, The Master's soul within the centre held, And with the Eternal Spirit Which is Christ Made one therein, far past all images And individual forms of him and her, Knew QUÃSTOR DEI and BEATA fix'd Henceforth and perfectly contain'd therein, While in the Immanent and Transcendent Godâ By hypostatic union and the bond Of love between Them, Which is Spirit of allâ They all, and Christ together, render'd up The Kingdom of separate thingsâfrom time's divorce And substitution finally redeem'dâ Into the Father's hands. And this is that Wherein God's end of being and of things Describes the perfect circle and returns To that beginning where the circle falls Within the centre. Having seen and known The eternal hope for those he led in truth, That centre gave the Master back to life, While in the East the red and saffron dyes Brought in another morning, breaking forth Upon a sleeping world. The Master hail'd With reverential eyes and worshipful Heart, the new glories of God's day proclaim'd, And took and did God's business in the day. Glory of cosmic pageants, glory and grace of all: Have I not dwelt among them? How should they weary or pall? The great processions go on, in their rhythm of stately joy: I walk among them and with them, or stand for a space aside, In a contemplation deepâperchance where the ways divide. In truth I am looking for Thee; and where the banners deployâ Is it there that Thou art? Or else in the gulf as of fire, Where the orange and purples open out the heart of their great desire? Or the starry dark of a sacred night eastward suddenly lightens? Who knows? I listen, I hear: the music crashes and heightens. There are seasons also of stillness, the pause of a peace that falls, And the only voice in the silence is that of the heart which calls. A sleep comes over the pageant; the mystery-plays suspend: It is Thou perchance in the stillness: is it Thou, at the journey's end? Ah, no! Save only in rumours, in portents behind a veil, I do not reach Thee in pageants, and their pomp at last, like a tale That is told, has given its message. Behold, I have lived in their light: Beyond these symbols, my End, my Need, call me to worlds of sight. XIV Priest and Priestess Before the rood-screen and the veil thereof The Pyx and Chalice of the Bearers stood, Clear-shining in the light which pierced the Veil, For now there rose upon its hither side A double cube of well-white marble, graved In gold with words and names and hidden signs, A mystic Altar by the Holy Place; And prompted by the monitor within They set their vessels down. As when they met On life's awakening side for that first time, Remembering a vigil in the past, Wherein the other side of life in sleep Forth-issued out of sleepâand what is named Deep dreamâinto a being-state of soul, Whereof all waking they had known should count Mere shadow of reality, so nowâ In vision and its open imagesâ Their souls recall'd that meeting in the world Of outward icons, what it proved for them Beyond the doubting foresight of the heart; How mortal flesh began to feel and see The wonder and the glory of the world; And how the mind incorporate therein Itself had entered on a being-state, Of which all measures through the past made known Were also shadows of reality. They, standing therefore upon either horn Of that white Altar, and themselves in light, From living light which dwelt beyond the veil, Began to realize that both the states Were at their root of purpose one within. Yet some swift-flying question pass'd through both: Whether the waking state of body and soul, With union reached therein, while soul and soul Preserved but rarefied the outward part, Had not a wholeness which the vision state Wanted, and whether individual willâ Which shaped its ends on earthâwere not for them A truer state than this most ghostly scene. Herein they moved as something not themselves Directed, whether from them apart or not, Andâin the high Rite integratedâshared No forming purpose midst activities Thereof. Only when motived pageant ceased Their part with one another intervened. Then it was will, activity, a state Of seeing in worlds on worlds, opening out And into one another, while the things Beheldâineffably, essentiallyâ Were one with that which saw; and in a mode Beyond all time the Everlasting Love Was its own object. But this moment pass'd, While that which follow'd ravish'd from their souls All notion of the personal part in them, All speculation of the mind, all sense Of place, of motive, operation there. They knew thenceforward that the Master-Lord Was in the many-mansion'd House, a still, Abiding Presence; and with one intentâ To find Him, see Him, worship Him thereinâ They went on quest, scarce knowing what they did, As inly spurr'd, unconscious that they movedâ In being's keen awareness, stripp'd of self. The Temple grew before them; but its halls, Chapels and chambers, vast scriptoria, Its stairwaysâoften as to height of stars Ascendingâand its secret doors which gave, At unsuspected angles, upon roofs Like platforms stretching through uplifted planesâ To them concentred, burning for the endâ Were not the mighty measures of a House, Whether by hands erected or drawn out In spiritual spaces, but the states And pregnant epochs of the master-questâ How long pursued who knows, Master and Lord? They met with spokesmen of the Mysteries Who saw the Master daily in the House, And said: Lo, here or there, turning to East And West, proclaiming gospels in His Name And bearing certain warrants in their hands, A proof of embassy; while other some On ancient books depending saw therein His first and final message, whence they preach'd Obedience, witnessing of penalties And great rewards. For such the Master's House Was not alone a Temple built with hands But raised by them or their progenitors. A few upon some spiritual side Of lower grooves depended. These affirm'd The earth His Temple, and that which seem'd a House All profitless till spiritually known, When chancel, altar and the Holy Place, With any Rites enacted these within, Would pass like shows and leave the soul with Godâ Not seen or realized, but joined in thought By moral bonds together. There and hereâ Rarest of allâa few with faces seal'd By perfect stillness, and with light thereon Forth shining, like the light behind the Veil, From inward source, the arms upon their breasts Folded, went up and down, speaking no word, Or in the Veil's glow waited, worshipping. These also, often on their knees received From Pyx and Chalice, at the Bearer's hands, The Bread and Wine, in recollection merged; And then the lambent flickering of light About the vessels got another mode Of lustreâa fix'd, penetrating glowâ As if all sunbeams had been focuss'd there. Two vessels looking like two Graals of grace, Two Bearers, a procession of the Graal Concentred, priest and priestess of a Rite According to MelchizedekâPriest and Kingâ Kept secret age on age, were here and now Made in the holy hiddenness manifest To two or three, in the Great Name and Word Gather'd together. But a thousand pass'd For whom the Veil was just a curtain's height; The man and maid were priests in ritual-guise Performing sacramental ministries; And these meant little. Of such questers, some Beyond the ceremonial and its form Had pass'd in thought; some held them worshipful But done in memory; and when the Graals Swept down the chancel, in the Bearer's hands Uplifted, shedding the strange light of them, Some saw the works of miracle and cried With open mouths. These follow'd from behind, Looking beyond the portals, where the crowd Were fed with Wine and Bread, or mix'd themselves With these, thereafterâup and down the landâ Preaching the Kingdom and the coming Christ, But understanding little in the heart, And hence from one distraction over soon To other flowing, like a shallow stream, At every point diverted. Now it came To pass, after a day of many days Perchance, that QUÃSTOR DEI and the Maid, BEATA MEA, on the Guide within Depending, ceased their quest about the House To find the Blessed Master and High Lord, But waitedâwatching over Pyx and Cupâ Because when toiling feet of body or soul Have wearied, vainly seeking up and down, The air about them as the heart within May with a holy suddenness give up The Blessed Master and the end of quest. I have borne my part in the Temples, The solemn state of each; I have shared in the lyrical dramas By action, song and speech. I have follow'd the holy functions Wherever their Rites have call'd, As one for those ends anointed, Exalted and install'd. I have held both Warrant and Charter, And where Grand Masters sat, Throned high in the eastern quarter, I have join'd the debate on that Which attests the Mastery. It is all of it great and good To share and hear and see; And if in the heartâas nowâ I ask whether these are Thine, The answer is: Surely Mine. But when I proceed: Is it Thou? A stillness falls on the vibrant halls And a hush on the Holy place: They have echoed from roof to base, But only with rumours of Thee. O House and Temple and Lodge, Upon all your craft and art I crave the grace of a blessing And join with thankful heart, Or ever we take the Closing And so from such walls depart. I have dwelt in your shaded spaces, Have shared their guerdons and graces To the very end and the essence; True signs of the grand totality Are raised up in divers places: But Give me, O God, the reality, One light of all in the Presence. XV A Golden Veil of Doctrine They are with their Master in the waking state: He sits again betwixt them andâwith hands Upliftedâteaches in the vesper-time. A humble country chapel's chancel steps Are now the place of meeting. Whether he Was priest therein they did not ask or know. Far other speculation fill'd their minds, While on his head the Sanctuary Lamp Cast faint and peaceful light through ruby glass, Weaving an aureole about his face And wool-white hair. As they in life assumed But in the sleep-state and its dreams laid flesh Aside, yet were the sameâone self in each Amidst all variations in their mode Of being and changes of environmentâ So Christ, the Master, Whom they sought in soul Perchance was he, no other, who without Had come of his own will into their lives. Shaped he their paths of vision who show'd forth True ways of practice in the daily round? When they should meet him in the hidden world Would he be other than he seem'd and was Betwixt them, seated in the twilight-tide? And would the hallows of the Pyx and Cup Shine at his presence with another light Than earth's or soul's, a very light of God Dwelling with man? Now from the Sacred Host Within the tabernacle's silken veil There fell upon them that which was not light But influxâout of holy heaven sent downâ Or rather upon him it seem'd to fall And from two centres, at his heart and head, Was ray'd within them. Such a Presence fill'd The Church of Nature when he sat beforeâ Green vistas round them. But even more than then His words transfigured all things: so of old At Cana, water from the springs of earth Became a wine which never in the world Gave forth the vintages of Galilee. Light from the Graal about them, words of God Exhibited His Mysteries in speech Of man, nor ever any human speech Was simpler. Like a blessed gospel-text Which holds the high vibrations of the life From the life-source outpour'd, it held the tones And chants and breathings of the world withinâ High sanctuary of hidden heart of things. So therefore drew the music wrought in words Into a single sense of harmony, Even as the Spirit Divine draws human souls And makes a oneness of eternal state Which is the perfect poem of each soul And its life-ode. Of that most sacred House Which seem'd their House of Vision and perchance Was of its modes and aspects shown in partâ So mighty texts of old in modern tongues Are put by modernsâagain the Master spoke, Of its high rumours moving down and up The realms of thought and history. Betwixt That side of things wherein the letter rules, Nor ever of itself uplifts a veilâ Because the veil it is, which cannot pass Beyond its natureâand that other mode Lying behind, spirit and inward sense, The Holy House is poised, as on a space Which serves for borderland where the two worlds Converge, itself an interlinking bond. There type in antitype dissolves and there The simple letter is itself a sign. O central point and sacred meeting-place Of all the sacraments, there falls the Bread, Broken within the Wine-Cup, and from both Issues one living Spirit of Life Divine. Never was place or house more deeply hid Within the souls of those who dwell therein. No temple ever was a part of mind As thou, mind-sphered in pure intelligence! No secret palace is enshrined like thee Within the heart, for thou art love thereof, Lo, in this House of God, soul, mind and heart Are found in oneness at the root of eachâ One vesture of that Spirit which is God, One eye which looks on Godâbut turn'd withinâ One fire by God enkindled, evermore Burning in Him, consumed, renew'd by Him, But He the substance, He the flame and He The kindling spark. Hereof the Secret House And its deep searching. So beneath the fieldsâ Yellow with harvests under a bright sunâ Lie hid the gold and jewels of the mine, Crypts and great treasure of the under-world. See then, till all the images dissolveâ Their order and their laws fulfill'd in Godâ Here is the common ground of those who pass Beyond the veils into the first great sense Which lies behind. This is the Holy House In sacramental things externalized And sum as such of all the sacraments. The signified is not without the sign Therein. The inward and the outward make A marriage, integrated more and more In one another while the worlds endure, Till that which now is the without for us Becomes by sanctity's dissolving work That which we call within. Then God's great endâ Which stands and knocks without the cosmic gatesâ Shall find all gates are open and come in. The House is theirs who have attain'd in Christ, By His own blood redeem'd, for blood is life, Eternal life, and so is understood In the deep symbols of this mystery. He leads the sons thereof from state to state Of that Divine Experience within Forth shadow'd once in holy, holy veilsâ The pageant of the Life in Palestine. A Birth Divine, a hidden life in God, And then the witness of an outward call; The mystic passion, cross and death thereon; The resurrection and ascent in God: Herein stands forth the story of the soul, From that first moment which is second birth To that last stage ineffable when man Goes back to God. The Many-Mansion'd House Presents in type the state before the end, The resurrection-life attain'd in Christ. So is it Holy Zion in the Heights, Palace of Peace and the Great Prince of Peace, The Paradise and Highest Court of Heaven. Those dwell therein who may have tasted death In bodies of earth or may in fleshly bonds Abide and wait upon deliverance; But mystic death has made them free in Christ. So is the end assured, and thus they dwell In unity, knowing their part in Him, The present which is He, the state to come And consummation of their life in God. Within the Sacred House there also dwell That Company of Spiritual Chiefs And Hierarchs, through the ages set to watch And through continued ages guard and guide The long succession of a royal race Whose secret once was mask'd as David's lineâ A priestly work which, when the days were full, Brought Joseph forth, the heir in fine of all, And from another dynasty, to earth As earth unknown, in Blessed Mary found For him a virgin mate, with mystic yoke Of nuptials in the Holy Heart of things, Not in the heart of flesh. So came in fine That Incarnation which was Birth Divine, An union of the Spirit and the Bride In earthly house of manâor body of Godâ Made manifest. So He Who is the Word In flesh abode among us, and the types Of this substantial union are in Church, In wayside Chapel and in mighty Fane Shown forthâa true analogy of thingsâ By Bread and Wine. The Secret Church above Is antitype of all the speaking signs And sacraments, the treasury of grace And power which fills them, permeates, overflows In the recipient's heart. Because of grace, Of sanctity, of thinking in the heart, Of Eucharistic Life Divine, which some Reach'd there and here, ascending from the world Of symbols to the power and glory held Within, a rumour went about the earth And bare its witness to the Holy House In many modes of doctrine and of thought, In many miracles of Wine and Bread, After the mode of legend told from one To other. In most sacred openings Of sacramental veils, whereat dissolved The elements, exhibiting behind Divine communions and the Word therein, Some part was given of God's grace and truth To hidden life of soul. Hereby began Great inquests up and down the Christian world. High reason follow'd them in holy schools Of doctrine, though the letter overlaid That witness. There were also secret ways Of league and fellowshipâin open words Some speaking, other some a hidden tongue Of symbol. There was more than all that school Of saintship lifted into sovereign realms Of a Divine Experience reach'd within, And this left glorious records, shining stillâ Beacons to those who in this narrow path Can follow and ascend the Mount of God. Such was in fine the spirit in that past Of single-hearted centuries, that the quest Was follow'd also and the tidings came Through great imagination's shaping modes, Andâout of expectationâfair romance Became a vehicle and thus put forth The Holy Graal. I thinkâthe Master saidâ Old stories now are preface to a new Romance of soul, which shall be told henceforth Of yesterday, to-day and evermore, With all the Mystery disclosed therein. So fell the Master's teaching once again To silence, and his hearers' hearts were fill'd With that high worship which election brings. But evermore they wonder'dâeach with each, Or inwardly, in humbleness of heartâ What power and mercy should have singled such As they, two children of obscurity, For so high ends. Now in the outward ways Full often meetingâsince the walls of things Dissolved about them upon every side And brought the pair together day by dayâ They heard the Holy Masses of the Church, And peace was with them. Many graces stood Around them, enter'd through their open doors And vivified. Yet of the secret things Behind the Eucharistâthe while endured This further space of interlude between The teaching of the Blessed Master's mouth And that of visionâno great message came, Fair intimations to the mind at work Or held in stillness. Knowing as they did That in their other, hidden side of life They served an Altar, like the priest on earth, But out of earthly things to those of soul Raised up, and were enring'd on every side With witness of the Presence; knowing too How in the spiritual House they bare The self-same elements of Bread and Wine; What hidden bond subsisted at the root Between the sacred work imposed on them And that of ministers in outward ways Ordain'd? No ordination save of work Imposed by service had the active life Of their strange sleep set as a seal on them. No consecration had their lips or hands Perform'd, though since the Many-Mansion'd House Roll'd back its portals and receiv'd them in, They knew what sacro-saintly life abode Within the Bread and Wine they bare and gave To crowds of worshippers who knelt without And some who follow'd on the quest within. Now, both were consciousâin distinctive waysâ Of inward trouble, dwelling on the place And pageant of their vision life, and all Its purpose, in comparison with that Which earthly paths had in these later days Assumed. How also did the House within Stand in relation to the visible Church Of God? And seeing that in deeper states Within they found the well of images Reduce its wealth of parabolic modes, While on the threshold of a time they seem'd To stand when all the pageants and the forms Should cease, and knowledge of the noumenal Be reach'd in being-stateâpure, simple, free And undiversified, the old mental sight, The tactions and auditions set aside Once and for allâperchance at end of things The speaking drama of the world of dream Would into teaching parable resolve And so discharge its purpose. Who should say? But only when the waking world dissolved, The words which spoke within them still convey'd That counsel, Patience, and that caution, No: Not yet. Now, whether in the part of flesh I know not, or in that half-seeming stateâ Say, after lips had sever'd, holy hands Still interlock'dâwhen the white ivory gates Began to open, while all thoughts and things Strangely converged and mix'd, it matters not: I do not know; but in each other's arms, After a pure and spiritual mode, They fell asleep into a world unknown, And reach'd, apart from any sense of place, Another state of vision, soul to soul Reveal'd, and each as an unspotted glass Wherein they look'd together and beheld Not deeps of one another, but their own. By such a perfect interchange of love, Out of the House of Life and House of Sleep, They knew the oneness, waking one with dream, One soul in twain, and at the root conjoin'd With one Christ-Spirit of the Word and God, Looking in Him to reach all end of quest. For QUÃSTOR DEI and BEATA may The veils lift further. May their sleep indeed Be fill'd with vision. May they find within One Spouse of both, and so for evermore Be and continue one in each and Him: Not QUÃSTOR DEI and BEATA nowâ In that great, timeless, everlasting nowâ Not Christ and they, or Christ and one from them Begotten by the motherhood of love, But union, unity and oneness, Christ As they in Him, and He in them, yet God In all ineffably, and all in God. They taught me many doctrines, and I made Due acts of faith in loyalty and laid Their freight upon me, till a Voice arose And said: All blessing on the man who knows The matter of the one true faith and thence Draws sacred doctrine of experience. Now, since my hope was in one Source and End, I held that Voice a Comforter and Friend. So, having put aside all yokes, I sought In sacred licence of untramell'd thought On mountain-heights of mind to reach my Goal. And past all peaks of thought I saw the soul, And in her hidden world I strove to find That which exceeds all altitudes of mind. Ah, but the soul that Presence may confess Through intimations which their seals impress, As light on earth impinged from furthest star. Hence from the soul herself the Goal was far, Till in her heart of love a certain door I open'd, with a permit to explore; And there the Goal my efforts could not winâ O Master-Goalâreach'd out and took me in. XVI Christ Mystical The waiting inquest in the House of Sleep And House of God continuesânot in vain. Apart from outward sign or inward word By still assurance silently infused, They knew that as the Master seen on earth Was in His proper time and mode declared, So too the Temple's Masterânot on earth Or in the Temple's outer court of heaven Beheldâmust in a fitting hour and way, After the order of the things of soul, To them be manifest, and then should lead To whatsoever hiddenness of God Abides behind the glory and the veil Of gold. The lesser pageants of the quest Moved round them in the many-sided House; Their own great Rite continued day by day, As days are counted in the world of dream. Yet in the midst of all, from all apart, Far and still farther they explored in thought And in that loving contemplation which Suspends most highest thoughtâupon the gulf Poised, tranced and quiveringâtheir sphere of soul, And an ineffable nature-unity They found in deepest heart of their desire To know the Master and attain in Him. How should He stand between them, who from vast To vaster world of union, each with each, Have daily, hourly travell'd? Does He come To separate or offer surface yokes And signs of marriageâsay, in joining handsâ Like outward Masters, bound by outward ways? Or shall He stand indeed as if without Who dwells within? So therefore, while the rich Experience ripen'd, magnified and grew, They learn'd that never as that Master came On earth would He Whom only hearts discern Be seen by them. Thus up from grade to grade The Presence sent its splinter'd shafts above The verge of conscious being. So it wax'd, At first a glimmering point, a notion first, An intuition, a new sense realized, Then living message of unutter'd Word, That time abiding when the twain-in-one Should hear the Word in all its fullness spoken, Being themselves the utterance. Meanwhile Full many worshippers without the gate, And some who went upon the quest within Seeking a term, and some who on the call Tarried, but ever for a Lord without Look'd only, saw the Blessed Master stand Between the Bearers of the Pyx and Cup, Hailing with joyful hearts the King to be In this most holy Church of living men. So all about the Many-Mansion'd House They said no longer, May Thy Kingdom come, But bless'd the Master and the King Divine, And all the worlds renew'd in joy with Him. Say: Peace be thine, when I go forth at length; But pray ye never for my soul's repose: Commend it rather to the Source of strength For other work, as sense of mission grows. The ways are vast, Amen: the worlds extend World without end. When after work achieved from star to star And all the missions in His Name fulfill'd, God draws me where the Halls of Silence are And at the heart of things the soul is still'd, Give me that active centre's restâah, then Such sleep. Amen. XVII Within the Veil On quÃ¦stor dei and BEATA came So great an opening of inward ways That when so e'er the earthly Master sat Between them, in a silence more than words He taught. All evil of the world within Had pass'd from both. The very word of it Perish'd. Their bodies and the needs of these Struck in no note of discord through the pure Tone-poem of two souls express'd henceforth In one great organ flood of melody. Their flesh itself, into the Law Divine Caught up, was after its material mode A perfect matter for the work of soul. So clarified, so shining, so transform'd, No outward change survened, as if a man Should pass them and behold with normal eyes Some sudden raying of a nimbus-light, Or even those who shared their home and board, Talk'd with them, took their hands or kiss'd at night And morning. From within the change of veils Came, and the light of it to soul alone Was visible. The Master saw and knew, Marking with joy the progress of the work, And now upon the dual plane of life All things grew perfect towards a perfect end. He in rare moments, amidst the silence, seem'd A spirit, an unembodied Word within, Which ever on the verge of utterance Paused, and a joy of expectation fill'd The twain, as if he should be yet declared In full. Moreover, if he spoke it seem'd Ever an echo of the waited Word, As though some virtue very far away Its last reverberations at dim gates Of sense expended and resounded there: A wisdom, crown'd and clothed in regnant speech. So were they led without in unity. Within, without the transformation grew And interlock'd, at once in man and maid, All modes by which the things unseen and seen Are realizedâin flesh, in vision life Of sleep, and in awaken'd ways of mind. Activities of each on either side To stillness tended, but the stillness rose From heart and centre of activity, An all ineffable continuance Of vibrant being. Uplifted in the ways Of vision through the sacred gates of sleep, Or drawn 'twixt these again to waking life, One life was theirs, one sense of end at hand. But after many intervening days, There came a Mass-Time when with Pyx and Cup They stood before the Portal of the House, While all the world about that sacred place, With many known and precious from the streets Of cities or the embosom'd country-side, Knelt on the steps and far and far away Stretch'd through the shining distance. Not as once They fed them by dispensing Wine and Bread; But Pyx and Chalice to their arms' full height Were raised in blessing on the multitude; And from those Sacred Vessels came a light Which was not light but flood of life outpour'd, Yet like a thousand suns. No word of all The heart's high Mass-Words did the Bearers speak, But through the still, quick air Words which were light And Life of life spoke in the soul of each, For Christ on that high morning was with those Who worshipp'd. All of them received from Him That which is He after the highest mode Whereto the individual soul could make An answer. So the holy work imposed Upon the Bearers to the end thereof Was brought. The Word received into the heart Abode therein. The people from their knees Rose up in silence: then a great hush'd cry Roll'd over, echoing from end to end And lifted quickly to a pÃ¦an's point, An acclamation, a triumphal song, While in the sight of that vibrating crowd The Pyx and Chalice in a blaze of light Were caught into the violet vault of heaven. Together growing in the altitude They seem'd one Cup, shone over by a Host's White disk, which slowlyâso a star might setâ Sank in the Chalice. In the rays thereof This melted, and a Spiritual Sun Over the Sacred Spiritual House Ray'd, emblematic of the Sun of Christ, And all the world beneath it burst in buds And blossoms; all the sparkling water-ways Scream'd music, singing of the River of Life; And all the orchard closes glow'd and groan'd In gladness, heavy laden with rich fruit, Like to the Tree of Life. Divested thus The Bearers stood, with arms upon their breasts Cross'd and heads bow'd, while on them fell the rays Of that most glorious Sun, till every hair Which crown'd them and their garments' every thread Were interwoven with its aureate light. So stood the twain transfigured, and midwise In the first line of worshippers they saw Their leading Master of the outward ways Clothed in the simple habit of a monk, Nor otherwise distinguish'd from the crowd. But when their eyes met, then he raised his hands In benediction, and they saw thereon The marks stigmatic of the mastership Shine faintly and a pallid nimbus round His brows, but looking like a crown of thorns. So he fell back among the crowd, which closed About him unawares, and so they knew Their Master's work upon the life of them Was finish'd. Therefore in a hush of hearts Thankful and gladden'd, conscious that they too Relinquish'd office in that hour and place, The twain turn'd inward and with reverent steps Went back into the Many-Mansion'd House: The portals closed upon them silently. Wrapp'd in a purely spiritual state, The House gave back to them no sense of quest, Andâthey so close upon attainment's vergeâ No human presence. Even theirs dissolved Into that single mode of being-life Which ever and again their souls had touch'd In most deep moments. They beheld alone The golden veil, the glory passing through And them possessing ever more and more. They did not seem to traverse aisle or nave; These also had dissolvedâat least for them: Only the veil remain'd and they thereby, As heart to heart is closeâtwo flames of love And white desire in utter whitest heat Rarefied: two as one, one flame, one love Drawn inward. Whether in or out of time I know not, but in state which lies beyond Duration's sense, upfolded, still'd in love, They knew the Master and the Word Divine With and within them. Then the Golden Veil Was parted, as another bar dissolved. O golden light, far shining, all within: O light beyond all light: O Life of life And Life exceeding life: O very God Of very God: a moment, and with eyes Of soul, upon the object and the end Of all soul's love they look'd. The Word made flesh In Palestine, as prototype of all Union between the Immanence within The cosmos and the souls abiding there, Shone glorious in the high heart of the lightâ Spirit and soul inwoven. A time-flash, And this had pass'd; but nowâapart from form Or aught distinguish'd as the sight of mindâ All in a keen awareness, they discern'd The omnipresent universal soul Of all humanity made one in Christ, The spirit of the cosmos. This in turn Gave way; even the universal soul Dissolved in union with the cosmic Christ And conscious realization therewithin. One moment; then the Immanence Divine Dissolved in the Divine Transcendence. Then It was as if a Voiceâwhich was no voice Of earth but like the heavens together run And flowing into utter'd harmonyâ Cried All in All. And the Great Mystery For QUÃSTOR DEI and BEATA reach'd Its consummation. The love-object drawn Within, to their own selves they died in love. Their separation pass'd in mystic death, And Godly-conscious in the Source and End, They knew as they were known henceforth in God. The Sacred Bread of manifested forms And things fell, sweetly broken and dissolved, Into the Wine-Cup of Eternal Life. Now I, who witness in humility Of these high things in nuptials of the soul, Thereafter left the Holy House and came To my own dwelling, looking to return To-morrow as the Keeper of the Gate. Give me that gracious morrow, Lord of All, Or the Eternal Now attain'd in Thee. A thousand thresholds of the Church of God In chapels and hermit-houses by the way: In these as substitutes our feet have trod, Poor pilgrims, fain to worship, waiting day. And the great minsters rise into the blue Of holy heaven, as our own hearts aspire; The solemn Rites perform their service due, Recording varied notes of our desire. O music, majesty, resounding prayer, Beyond the Churches that we build and see, Beyond those forms which we have made so fair, On some Lord's day, in spirit, transplant us where The Priest and Master of the Rite is He. Lord Christ, high term of every sacred vow, The Church within the Churchâthat Church is Thou. XVII Valete Last symbol, very sacrament, last type Before all types dissolve upon the verge Of one unveiled reality, I bring The speaking witness of the inward eyes That, once encompass'd by your Godward orm, Beheld its meanings andâfrom eyes to heart More deeply held withinâhave known its life, Which compasses and penetrates and fills. A House of Many Mansions, built of God, Wherefrom the protoplasts and types go forth; High Palace of the Presence; fountain-point Which sanctions delegates and calls them back, Commissions priests and yet again withdraws Beyond all Rites; foundation-seat of grace Outflowing, salving the elect; and souls, Transmuted by that grace, in fine return Where the hush'd stillness keeps them: I, who stand And watch and pray within the Holy Place, Have caught beyond all voices and beyond All image-making of your sanctuary A wordless call to follow where it leadsâ Thither whence none return. On that dread brink I look to lay my human nature down, Bear all I am into the All of All, And in a last attainment of the self Set self aside for ever. Having learn'd The grievous lessons of the Thou and I, Take me within, that I may know in Thee, Lord, but in Me no more. So, standing thus On Thine unimaged thresholdâwhile the bonds Begin to slip, the longing to be done Quivers within, the deep of Thine abyss DrawsâI turn once to witness of Thy House, For others call'd thereto. Hear in the heart, Ye who have ears within. May open doors Receive you, may the Temple of the Light Lift broider'd veils and let the secret placeâ Wherein the Master of the House abidesâ Give up the Presence and the Mystery Of Thee and Him, face unto face and eye To eye. So only, never else, unfolds The undeclared, the infinite state beyond Both Him and Thee, God and man's end therein.</field>
