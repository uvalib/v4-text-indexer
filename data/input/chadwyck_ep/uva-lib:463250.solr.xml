      <field name="fulltext">The Prouerbes of the noble and woorthy souldier Sir Iames Lopez de Mendoza Marques of Santillana The first Chapter, of Loue, and Feare. 1 My sonne, whom I doe dearly loue, Vnto my wordes geue eare. Seeke not by rigour for to rule, Nor gouerne men by feare. Loue, and thou shalt beloued be. And by the same shalt doe Such worthie things, as hated thou shalt neuer attaine vnto. 2 Who can assoile the man thats dread from care and deadly feare? If any reason, minde, or witte in him that dreads appeare? Esteeme, and thou shalt be esteemed: for feare is to the sense A griefe that cannot be exprest, a deadly pestilence. 3 Great Cæsar as the stories tell, most cruelly was slaine, And yet the woorthiest conquerour, that in the world did raigne. Who on the earth so mightie is, that when he is alone, Can of himselfe doe any more, then can a seely one? 4 Howe many haue I seene, by loue aduaunced hye? But many more I haue beheld cast downe for tyranny. For vertuous minds in b?dage brought, will slacke no time, but trie By all the force and meanes they can, to come to libertie. 5 O sonne, be milde and amiable, lay loftie lookes aside: The hautie and disdainfull man the Lorde can not abide. Of wicked and malicious men auoide the companie, For all their doings tende to strife, and ende with villanie. 6 And let your answeres still be such, as may procure good will, As best beseemes a gentleman, not froward, rude, nor ill. O sonne, howe little doth it cost, at all times well to speake, Howe little againe doth it auaile, with wordes thy wrath to wreake? 7 Flee Taletellers and backbiters, that striue to please the eare: As greedy rauening wolues, that seek the seelly Lambes to teare, Whose traiterous traines and pathes do nothing else at all, But serue for snares and subtle traps, Where heedelesse men doe fall. 8 Assuerus, if he had not heard, eche part with equall eare: Had greatly abusde the sword, that he for iustice due did beare. And into errour fallen, which straight he would haue wisht vndone: So had the guiltlesse creature died, that no offence had doone. 9 For verie seldome shalt thou finde the absent to be cleare, And guiltie seldome shalt thou see the man that doeth appeare. Heare well the cause, and sodainly do no man thou acquit: Yet take good heed that in thy pause, thou vse both skill and wit. 10 The deed thats done by good aduice, doth alwayes firmely stand, And seldome seene to craue amendes at any second hand. Be ruled by counsaile euermore, whatsoeuer thou dost intend, And from thy side let neuer goe thy faythfull aged friend. 11 So long the common wealth of Rome Did floorishe strong and glad: As they their aged senatours, At home in honour had. But when that Tirantes once began, To rule and beare the sway, They neuer any conquest made, But lost from day to day. The second Chapter. of Knowledge and Wisdome. 12 Apply thy selfe with all thy force Some knowledge to attaine Procure the same with studie great, With diligence and paine But seeke not to be learned thou, For fonde desire of praise: But skilfully to reprehende The vnskilful sinners waies. 13 By learning shalt thou vnderstande, What God hath doone for thee: And what he dayly bringes to passe, For all in eche degree. And howe to loue and honour him, This dreame forgotten quite: Whereof within a litle time. Thou shalt forgoe the sight. 14 To Gentlemen it doeth belong. To knowe the artes diuine, Where knowledge chiefly floorisheth. And learning best doeth shine. Assuredly he well deserues To haue the vpper seate, That garnished with wisedome is, And deckt with learning great. 15 The head and spring of goodnesse al, Is wisedome, that doeth shewe The meanes for to discerne the trueth, And vertue pure to knowe. Who so beginneth in his youth In vertue to delight, No doubt, but when he comes to age, Will leade his life aright. 16 That most renowmed Solomon for wisedome chiefely sought, Whereby his Empire and his state to order good he brought. He gouernd of himselfe alone, and neuer did debate, Nor counsaile callde for anie thing, that longed to his state. 17 If thou be eloquent, great praise thereof to thee will rise, But much more commendable it is to be discrete and wise. For he that wisedome hath, will all his life obedient be Vnto the rules, he learned hath in sweete Philosophie. 18 Roboam being one that had no skill, but did assay, In euerie thing to striue against the streame, did soone decay: For vexing and molesting of his subiects kept in thrall, Wh? least he look'd for such a change, they quite forsooke him all. 19 My sonne, serue God with all thy heart, for why, his wrath from hie Doth fall, and whiske through all the worlde in twinkling of an eie. For when he list, he casteth downe such as he blessed late, And doth aduaunce the godly man to great and hie estate. 20 Be conformable to the time, and season that dooth fall: For otherwise to be, is cause of griefe and losse of all. Abhorre presumption as a mon- ster and an enimy To knowledge, that is onely light and lampe of magestie. 21 For time is it, that all things makes, and time doth all things marre: And when dame Fortune pleased is, such things as hurtfull are, Fall out to our commoditie, and many times doe please: While such things as c?modious are, doe turne to our disease. 22 My sonne, the wiseman and his life, still set before thy face: And speake no euill of thy Prince, in anie secret place, Looke that thy toung &amp; iudgement both such nets do warily shun: For why, the very walles them selues, will witnes what is doone. The third Chapter of Iustice. 23 From Iustice see thou varrie not, for duetie, loue, nor feare: Let no good turne at any time procure thee to forbeare. Or for to swarue in any point, from sentence iust and right: In giuing dewe correction to the faithlesse fautie wight. 24 This is the iust and certaine line, that safely vs doth guide: And shewes the true and perfect path, by measure truely tryed. She chosen was by God him selfe, sent downe from heauen hye, The Prophet doth confirme that she descended from the skye. 25 Howe worthie was the famous act of Lentus noble knight, Who all affection set aside, and loue forgotten quight, Contented was (though guiltlesse he) of anie trespasse donne, The cruel torturs of the lawe to suffer with his sonne? 26 Frondinus to the ende he would preserue the lawe he made, Without delay did cast himselfe, vpon the piercing blade. And therefore ought we to enforce our selues to liue vpright, If that we will correctours be of others ouersight. The fourth Chapter of Pacience and moderate Correction. 27 Be not to hastie nor to quicke, in rage without respect, But beare a t?perate hand, when thou the offender dost correct. For moderate correction is good, and free from blame: Where crueltie, that doth exceede, deserues reproch and shame. 28 The man that seekes to make amends, refuse not to relieue, Nor let it euer thee delight, the wofull wretch to grieue. A base and beastly minde it is to follow him that flies, And valiant is it, to assaile the tyrant that destroyes. 29 It doth declare a noble minde, for to forgiue a wrong, And with a perfect pacience, to forbeare and suffer long. The mercie that with measure meetes is vertue great to praise, Restorer of thy state with life, And lengthner of thy dayes. 30 What man is there aliue, that may So great offender be, But if that he be iudged by rules of loue and charitie: His trespasse shall appeare such as May pardon well deserue? For mercie is the shield, that doeth The guiltie onely serue. 31 I alwayes iudge him worthy prayse, that pardoneth gratiously: For mercie doubtlesse is to man a crowne of honour high. On the other side I doe mislike, the sworde with blood to stayne, The stroke whereof vniustly dealt, cannot be called agayne. 32 I do not meane that lothsome crimes, and hainous pardon craue: Or that the wholsome lawes, or good decrees restraint shoulde haue: For such a man ought not to liue, as murdereth wilfully: True iustice alwaies doth commaund, that he that killes, shal die. 33 To pardon such a kinde of man, were verie crueltie: And quite contrary to the rule, of all humanitie. Nor name of pitie doeth deserue, that suffers vilannie. But is the ouerthrowe of lawes, and all authoritie. The fifth Chapter of Temperance. 34 As much as it deserueth praise, with temperance to feed. Which doth our mortall life sustaine, and serueth for our need: So much abhorred ought to be the greedy glutton great, That thinkes there is no other life, but for to drinke and eate. 35 Great honour doth this temperance, deserue at all assayes, Sith it a vertue alwayes is, of great and speciall praise: For heate and furie great it doeth by honestie asswage, And stayes the frantike flame, that in the youthfull yeares doth rage. 36 But seeldome pouertie is seene, such persons to molest: As are of heedfull gouernement, aud slouthfulnesse detest, But idlenes and gluttonie where once they doe infect, No vertue euer doe regarde, nor honour doe respect. 37 His time he may not idlely spend, that seeketh for to gaine. For knowledge is not gotten, but by industrie and payne. So oughtest thou for to rule thy life, and order such to keepe: As thou preferre a gaineful watche, before a harmefull sleepe. 38 For procreation onely, and encrease of mortall kinde, Forsake the chast virginitie, with wise and sober minde. Consider that this vaine delight was once the wofull fall Of Solomon, for which he lost both wit, and grace and al. 39 And for the selfesame greeuous sinne, Was Dauid brought full lowe: And in the midst of mortall plagues, was taught his fault to knowe: The loftie Tarquin in his pride, Was punished therfore, And from the stately gates of Rome, Was thrust for euermore. 40 No lesse was worthie Scipio, Commended for the deede: That from his chaste and worthie mind, Did worthily proceede. Then for his valiant manly actes, Esteemed in his daies, By which he to his Countrey got, A neuer dieyng praise. 41 Shunne idlenesse, and giue thy selfe To honest exercise. That neither wicked vice, nor lewde Alurementes of the eies, Haue power or force at any time, To bring thy hart in thrall: For to subdue the raging fleshe Is (sure) no matter small. 42 For not yenough it is, to flee From actions lewde or il, But also from the motion to offende in thought or wil. So muche we ought for to eschewe, The foule and wicked thought: Because it is the only seede, And roote of doeing nought. 43 A goodly ornament to man, I doe account the wife, Where as shee is obedient, To reason all her life. In marriage looke thou be not led, By fancy or opinion: But in thy choyse beeware and wise, With heede and great discretion. 44 For such as seeke a wife for goodes, and do not greatly way Her vertues, nor her honestie, do seeke their owne decay. A harme it is that hath no helpe, such mariage for to make, Wherefore, my sonne, let neuer such a fault thee ouertake. 45 The beautie and the fauour sweete of women could I praise, If them I found accompanied with wisedome anie wayes. But verie hardly or by happe, they agree togither right, And many times they are the markes of persons that be light. 46 Yet here withall I do not count the kinde of women all, To be vnprofitable, or of vse or value small: For why, I know they haue been praisd of diuerse worthily, And that their vertues haue been pende in manie an hystorie. 47 For, setting here aside that sweete and blessed worthie rose, That ouer all the rest doth shine, and farre beyonde them goes: The daughter of the thundring God, and spouse vnto the hiest, The light and lampe of women all, who bare our sauiour Christ: 48 Manie Ladies of renowne and beautifull there bee, That are both chast and vertuous, and famous for degree. Amongst the blessed holy saintes, full many a one we find, That in this c?passe may be brought, for liues that brightly shinde. 49 What should I of Saint Katheren that blessed martyr tell: Among the rest of Virgins all, A flowre of preecious smell? Well worthy of remembrance is her beawty, and her youth: And eke no lesse deserueth praise her knowledge in the trueth. 50 We finde that Hester wanted nei- ther beawtie great, nor grace: Whose noble minde was ioyned with the fauour of her face, Of Iudith likewise doe we reade, the bewtie great to bee: And how she vertuously behaude her selfe in eche degree. 51 The famous worthy women, that among the heathen warre, No reason that of good reporte among the rest we barre. For why? their valure and renoume was woundrous in their dayes: And therfore not to be depriude of due deserued praise. 52 In Athens and in Thebes too wer Ladyes great of fame. The Troians, Sabynes, Greeks &amp; Arge had many a worthy dame, The Laurentines, the Amasons may triumph for the same. And Rome of vertuous women can, remember many a name. 53 No fairer creatures coulde be seene, then Vagnes and Diana: Daphnes, Dido, Anna, and the vertuous Lucretia. Nor vnrembred let wee passe Virginia, the same Whose passing chastitie procurde her euerlasting fame. 54 Prefer a life with libertie, aboue all other things: A vertue great it is, and wor- thy of the paines it bringes. A shamefull great reproch it is, without it for to flye: An honourable thing it is for such a good to dye, 55 Oh, what a death had Cato dyed if it had lawfull beene: And had not by the iust decrees of God beene made a sinne. No lesse doe I the worthy fact of Mucius heere commend: That Lyuie in his story hath so eloquently pende. 56 For (sonne) if thou do much esteeme thy selfe, and seekst to liue, Thou neuer shalt receiue the crowne, that mightie Mars doth giue: But if thou doost abandon all faint hart and foolish feare: Thou shalt not want the honour, nor the state thou seekest to beare. 57 Detest an euill life, thats led with foule reproch and shamet And alwayes ready be to dye, with honorable name. For life cannot be lent for loane, nor let from day to day: Nor can the appoynted houre bee shund nor skaped any way. 58 King Codrus rather chose to haue the conquest then to liue, And neuer did his noble minde refuse his life to giue, To saue a valiant companie of such as him did serue, The life is alwayes well bestowed that doth such praise deserue. 59 Take no delight to heare thy deedes commended to thy face, A thing that wisedome alwayes hath accounted for disgrace, And if thou doest reprochfull wordes of anie man sustaine, It is no commendation, to to report the same againe. 60 Likewise the praising of thy selfe, thine actes and speciall grace, Doth neuer thee aduaunce, but all thy doings doth deface. For if the deedes that here thou dost, be onely done for praise, An errour great thou dost commit, and walkst the croked wayes. 61 Such things as wonderfull do seeme, but seld or neuer tell, For all men haue not heades alike, To iudge thy credite well. And many wordes to vse doth shew, no great perfection, Tis better for to shew thy deedes, and let thy tongue alone. The sixth Chapter of Liberalitie and Franknesse. 62 Be franke and free at all assayes, with speede bestowe thy gift: The goodliest grace in giuing, is to be short and swift. Well vnderstand the qualitie of that thou doest bestowe, Which seene, thou shalt be able soone the quantitie to knowe. 63 By worthy liberalitie great Alexander wan His fame and high renowne, when all the worlde he ouerran. And likewise Titus for his franke- nes great, and actes of fame. Amongst the worthy conquerours obteind a woorthy name. 64 But Midas with his masse of golde, was had in great disdayne, And he and al his treasures thought to be but fond and vayne, The fowle vnprincely answeare of Antigonus the king, With stayne vnto his state, his name to infamie did bring. 65 I lyke not him thats prodigal, nor such I list to prayse: And yet the man that well deserues, I hurt not any wayes. The troth is, that I much mislike to liue in neede and want: But ten times more a miser, that is couetous and scant. 66 The great Darius easllyer was, destroyde for all his might, And of his valiant aduersary subdued, and put to flight: Then might Fabricius moued be, with couetous desire, Whose hart with filthy auaryce coulde not be set on fire. 67 To helpe a man in miserie, our dutie vs doeth binde: And not to doe it when we may, is odious and vnkinde. A noble minde will neuer stayne it selfe with such a blotte, Nor suffer such a great offence, nor such a filthie spotte. The seuenth Chapter of Truth. 68 Truth honour thou, &amp; alwayes loue, step not from her aside, But frame thy friendship after her, that euer may abide. The Image faire of holy life, and daughter true is she, As faithful sister vnto ver- tue, chiefe is honestie. 69 Attilius knowing well before, That he shoulde surely dye If vnto Carthage he returnd,, Obseruing faithfully His troth and woord, deferd no time For to returne againe, Where as he suffred tormentes great By death and deadly paine. The eight Chapter of Continence in coueting. 70 Of worldly goodes possesse no more, nor farther seeke to haue. Then may suffice thy neede, &amp; cleare thy conscience after graue. All ouerplus with heede auoyde, for more then meete is nought, And nothing can continue long, that on the earth is wrought. 71 The more thou gettest continually, the more thou still doest craue, Nowe iudge (of twaine) which is the best, if that thou reason haue: To be a Lorde of riches great, with griefe and toile and care, Or quietly to liue content with small and decent share? 72 The riches that we heere possesse With hast away doe flee: And as the tides with floods and ebbes, They mooue continually. Seeke thou the treasures of the minde, Which stande like brasen walles, Both firme and sure, a safe defence Whatsoeuer thee befalles. 73 Seeke not ambitiously to reigne, nor rule with tirranny, But both her woorkes and waies see that thou shunne aduisedly: And choose the meane estate, among the which tis best to liue: So shalt thou passe with pleasure all the time that God doeth giue. 74 For thinke not that the loftie state, nor throne of high degree Doeth make a man the perfecter, or hapier to be. It rather doeth his cares encrease, and giues him griefe and paine, And on his necke, that erst was free, doeth cast a careful chaine. 75 Seeke that which thou maist easily haue, and care not for no more, For thou shalt see from time to time, if that thou watch therfore, The loftie states and mightie powers, come topsie-turuy downe: And he that late a Miser was, with ioy to weare the crowne. 76 Trust not vnto the state of those, that hastilie mount a hie: But looke to see them fall as fast as euer they did flie. For be thou sure the wicked man, shall neuer long endure: His happy fortune shall him faile, when most he thinkes her sure. 77 If that thou wilt abundance haue, liue to thy selfe content With only that which nature findes, to be sufficient. I haue not seene men troubled much their liuing for to get: But many for to mount alofte, Their hartes asunder fret. 78 Then let vs well the matter waie, what if thou doest possesse, Great store of goodes obteined heere, by fraude and wickednesse: What great assurance hast thou nowe, that thee may certifie Thou shalt not come by chaunce or hap to begge before thou die? 79 How many riche men haue we seene, in litle time decay, And from their great &amp; loftie states, slipt downe and fallen away: How many haue been laught to scorne, For putting of their trust In this fonde fickle honour heere, nowe tumbled in the dust? 80 And thus if I haue tolde the trueth, In these preceptes of mine: Seeke not for riches nor desire, the thing that is not thine. And if thou doest demaunde of me, to whom they doe belong: To fortune: thus I answeare thee, that list not to be long. The nienth Chapter. Of Enuie. 81 Let not the enuious man in life, a paterne be to thee, Nor walke thou in his froward paths, nor keepe him companie. It is not for a vertuous minde, such errour to commit: Nor doth a noble hart beseeme so ill to vse his wit. 82 Nought else doth enuie bring to passe nor other seede doth sowe, Then murders, mischiefes, cruelties, and suttle ouerthrowe. As by the Scripture doth appeare, where cursed Caine did kill Poore Abel (that offended not) vpon malicious will. The tenth Chapter of Thankefulnesse. 83 Good turnes that haue been done to thee, haue still before thine eie, And when to recompence the same it in thy power doth lie, Requite them with a cheerefull hart And waying well in minde What friendship hath been shewde to thee be neuer thou vnkinde. 84 O what a shamefull staine it was, to Ptolomei the king, The noble Pompey traiterously vnto his death to bring. And Ezekias, for his great vnthankfulnesse did pay, When by the wrath of God he should haue died before his day. The eleuenth Chapter of Friendship. 85 The man that councell good can giue and will thee reprehend, And warne from euery euill act, choose thou to be thy friend. And thinke thy selfe thrise happy, wh? thou such a friend canst haue, That will thee well instruct, and from all ill aduises saue. 86 And he that is thy friend, I wish and warne in any case, Thou keepe and vse him as a friend, in euery time and place. I speake not of the flatterer, who vnder colour sweete: Of sugred speeche and pleasant shewe with gift of gall doth greete. 87 If thou conceale thy thoughts, and that thy minde in secret lyes: Thou shalt be sure to be esteemde and taken to be wise. Ofte haue I found my selfe by speache in thrall and trouble brought: But neuer yet for keeping of my toung, I suffred ought. 88 But yet I would not haue thee heere, to be so straightly tyed: That from thy deere &amp; speciall friend thou shouldst thy doings hide. For why? it were to great offence, t'abuse his friendship so: And euen the redyest way it were, to make thy friend thy foe. 89 See thou thy life be alwaies such, in deede and eke in showe: As thou regardest not a whit, though all the worlde did knowe. Vnto thine honour and thy name, haue alwaies speciall eye: To shunne the thing thou oughtest to shunne and all offence to flye. The twelfth Chapter of Duetie to Parents. 90 Great reuerence to the parents euermore we ought to giue: And with obedience honor them, as long as they doe liue. The Lord him selfe hath promised assuredly that hee That doth the same, with long &amp; hap- py life, shall blessed bee. 91 By motherly perswasions Veturia did asswage (And with her presence pacifie) the Roman in his rage. On th'other side the beastly lust of that same monster vile, With incest and with murder did, his hatefull hart defile. 92 And heere we may not ouerslip the wicked Absolon, But call to minde his froward hart, and fond presumption. For neuer haue we seene nor shall, that he that is vnkinde, Doth any grace with GOD aboue, or any fauour finde. The thirtienth Chapter, of Age. 93 Let not olde age thee discontent, since that it is the race, And moste approued perfect path, of goodnesse and of grace. O milde and honourable Age, that doest abate the fire Of vicious youth, and doest restraine, eche lewde and fond desire! 94 This to the vertuous man alone, doth giue authoritie, And makes him perfite in the pointes of grace and honestie. For who is he that in his youth can keepe the perfite way? Or measure in his life obserueth? or runneth not astray? 95 This made the Catoes so renoumed for wisdome great and graue: this made the valiant Scipioes, so great a name to haue. This onely gouernes in the field, and giues the victorie, And this in peace doth co?tries keepe from all hostilitie. The fourtienth Chapter, of Death. 96 Suppose thou not at any time that death is farre from thee, But alwayes thinke that he is nie, and streight at hande will bee. great madnesse were it for a man, to thinke this foolish life Should euermore continue with such miserie and strife. 98 If it so were the blessed ioyes, that we doe hope to see, Should all in vayne and to no end, of vs desired be. Ne shoulde the glorie great of that almighty Lorde on hye, Our Sauiour Christ be looked for, that lasts continually. 99 Then tel me, wherfore should we feare this death, why should it grieue? Since that it is so good a lot, if that we doe beleeue, That after our departure here we goe to perfect rest, Attending for the glorious day, wherein we shall be blest. 100 And heare to make an end, I say, the onely remedie In all extreames, is for to keepe, the perfect meane with thee: Which if thou takest for thy friend, a long and happie life Thou shalt be sure to leade, and liue without offence or strife.
